This three-part documentary focuses on Oswiecim-Brzezinka (Auschwitz-Birkenau) in general and on the inner-workings of the camp, the blueprints for genocide, in particular.  There are interviews with people who were actually there (on both sides), multiple historical re-enactments, pictures, documents, diagrams, blueprints, plenty of narration, you name it.  We start from the beginning, the seeds that led to genocide and the first baby steps towards it (euthanising the mentally ill in Germany), to the creation of the camp and some of its first victims, such as the orphaned French children (prior to early 1942 the camp had only housed male Polish political prisoners and criminals), and finally to the period of the camp's highest murder rate, the arrival of Hungarian Jewry starting in May of 1944, through to liberation, what happened to the survivors, how some of the people in charge were caught and brought to justice, and how some, such as Mengele, were never.  We also get, along the way, information about some of the other death camps, such as Treblinka, and how that camp did not start out as a model camp (it was run so ""inefficiently,"" not enough people murdered quickly enough and then disposed of in a quick and speedy matter, that the person running the camp, ""Dr."" Irmfried Eberl, was dismissed).  Also included are episodes about how the power corrupted many of the Nazis running or working at the camp, sometimes leading to intrigue.  It was also a welcome change of pace for there to be a segment on the notorious sadistic Irma Grese (who was hanged for crimes against humanity shortly after the War); too often all these kinds of books and documentaries talk about are male Nazis, when history shows that there were a number of women, such as Grese, who were equally cold, brutal, top-ranking, and sadistic.  The extras are also very good, featuring some very insightful interviews with a variety of people, on topics such as why genocide is still allowed to occur, what we have learnt from the Shoah, and young peoples' reactions to the documentary.",5,Harrowing triumph,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2276,"['film', 'documentary', 'could', 'ever', 'fully', 'cover', 'enormity', 'Shoah', 'everything', 'went', 'last', 'aspect', 'one', 'really', 'mark', 'area', 'Shoah', 'chose', 'focus', 'three-part', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'Oswiecim-Brzezinka', 'Auschwitz-Birkenau', 'general', 'inner-workings', 'camp', 'blueprints', 'genocide', 'particular', 'are', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'sides', 'multiple', 'historical', 're-enactments', 'pictures', 'documents', 'diagrams', 'blueprints', 'plenty', 'narration', 'name', 'start', 'beginning', 'seeds', 'led', 'genocide', 'first', 'baby', 'steps', 'euthanising', 'mentally', 'ill', 'Germany', 'creation', 'camp', 'first', 'victims', 'such', 'orphaned', 'French', 'children', 'prior', 'early', '1942', 'camp', 'had', 'only', 'housed', 'male', 'Polish', 'political', 'prisoners', 'criminals', 'finally', 'period', 'camp', 'highest', 'murder', 'rate', 'arrival', 'Hungarian', 'Jewry', 'starting', 'May', '1944', 'liberation', 'what', 'happened', 'survivors', 'how', 'people', 'charge', 'were', 'caught', 'brought', 'justice', 'how', 'such', 'Mengele', 'were', 'never', 'also', 'get', 'way', 'information', 'other', 'death', 'camps', 'such', 'Treblinka', 'how', 'camp', 'did', 'not', 'start', 'out', 'model', 'camp', 'was', 'run', 'so', 'inefficiently', 'not', 'enough', 'people', 'murdered', 'quickly', 'enough', 'then', 'disposed', 'quick', 'speedy', 'matter', 'person', 'running', 'camp', 'Dr.', 'Irmfried', 'Eberl', 'was', 'dismissed', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'episodes', 'how', 'power', 'corrupted', 'many', 'Nazis', 'running', 'working', 'camp', 'sometimes', 'leading', 'intrigue', 'was', 'also', 'welcome', 'change', 'pace', 'be', 'segment', 'notorious', 'sadistic', 'Irma', 'Grese', 'who', 'was', 'hanged', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'shortly', 'War', 'too', 'often', 'kinds', 'books', 'documentaries', 'talk', 'are', 'male', 'Nazis', 'when', 'history', 'were', 'number', 'women', 'such', 'Grese', 'who', 'were', 'equally', 'cold', 'brutal', 'top-ranking', 'sadistic', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'featuring', 'very', 'insightful', 'interviews', 'variety', 'people', 'topics', 'such', 'why', 'genocide', 'still', 'allowed', 'occur', 'what', 'have', 'learnt', 'Shoah', 'young', 'peoples', 'reactions', 'documentary']",N/A
877522,A34DXWXAQPWQ5G,B000777JH8,"astrology hound ""&#34;Adrian&#34;""","[12, 36]","My only criticism of this amazing series is that there is so little mention of the murder of homosexuals and their experiences after liberation for those who survived. Many gay Holocaust survivors were denied compensation and acknowledgement by the German government by the end of the century because they were considered to be ""ligitimately imprisoned.""  It is my understanding that this status changed only recently. Others served prison sentences for being gay that continued after they were liberated from Auschwitz. While the numbers are small in comparison to the vast number of Jewish prisoners that were murdered, the conversation about sexual persecution in the Nazi regime is crucial to appreciating their great intolerance and deconstructing their human ""ideal"". (See the film ""Paragraph 175"" on the Nazi persecution of homosexuals.)  While the documentary Auschwitz-Inside the Nazi State is very strong, I'm recommending it because of the interviews with Linda Ellerbee that are included as part of the bonus features of the DVD.  A lot of times when looking at material like this outside of a classroom or alone, one wishes to have some kind of discussion group or process around what has just been witnessed--to hear how others have attempted to interpret what seems beyond comprehension.  I was impressed with the group of scholars that we heard from and there were many references to more contemporary genocides in Rwanda and the Sudan. (Again, a scholar on the experience of gays and political prisoners in concentration camps is absent.) I think this would be ideal for a classroom; specifically and most movingly, the testimonies of the students who speak to Ellerbee in the last interview.  They have definitely put some thought into their responses and I could see students being inspired by their eloquence.  Ellerbee says at the end, ""You give me hope"" and I felt the same way.",5,Amazing bonus features -- powerful questions and answers,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,1900,"['only', 'criticism', 'amazing', 'series', 'so', 'little', 'mention', 'murder', 'homosexuals', 'experiences', 'liberation', 'who', 'survived', 'Many', 'gay', 'Holocaust', 'survivors', 'were', 'denied', 'compensation', 'acknowledgement', 'German', 'government', 'end', 'century', 'were', 'considered', 'be', 'ligitimately', 'imprisoned', 'understanding', 'status', 'changed', 'only', 'recently', 'Others', 'served', 'prison', 'sentences', 'being', 'gay', 'continued', 'were', 'liberated', 'Auschwitz', 'numbers', 'are', 'small', 'comparison', 'vast', 'number', 'Jewish', 'prisoners', 'were', 'murdered', 'conversation', 'sexual', 'persecution', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'crucial', 'appreciating', 'great', 'intolerance', 'deconstructing', 'human', 'ideal', 'See', 'film', 'Paragraph', '175', 'Nazi', 'persecution', 'homosexuals', 'documentary', 'Auschwitz-Inside', 'Nazi', 'State', 'very', 'strong', ""'m"", 'recommending', 'interviews', 'Linda', 'Ellerbee', 'are', 'included', 'part', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'lot', 'times', 'when', 'looking', 'material', 'outside', 'classroom', 'alone', 'one', 'wishes', 'have', 'kind', 'discussion', 'group', 'process', 'what', 'just', 'been', 'witnessed', 'hear', 'how', 'others', 'have', 'attempted', 'interpret', 'what', 'comprehension', 'was', 'impressed', 'group', 'scholars', 'heard', 'were', 'many', 'references', 'more', 'contemporary', 'genocides', 'Rwanda', 'Sudan', 'Again', 'scholar', 'experience', 'gays', 'political', 'prisoners', 'concentration', 'camps', 'absent', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'ideal', 'classroom', 'specifically', 'most', 'movingly', 'testimonies', 'students', 'who', 'speak', 'Ellerbee', 'last', 'interview', 'have', 'definitely', 'put', 'thought', 'responses', 'could', 'see', 'students', 'being', 'inspired', 'eloquence', 'Ellerbee', 'end', 'give', 'hope', 'felt', 'same', 'way']",N/A

One unsettling admission is how much like ""us"" the Nazis seemed to be when interviewed after the war. They believed, at the time, that what they were doing was the right thing to do. They weren't, as I always thought, ""just following orders."" They believed in what they were doing. How often do we all say that? And how often are we just plain wrong? We need to understand these things and more if we are to truly to be able to say, ""Never again!""

877526,A2R5VKE4YO966D,B000777JH8,Charles Curtis,"[31, 31]","I just watched this film again, for the second time.Three years ago, I made the trip to southern Poland and visited O'wi'cim, just outside Krakow..  I saw part of remnants of the massive concentration camp and industrial complex there that that the Germans called Auschwitz- Specifically the two extermination camps at Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II Birkenau.  The experience was one of the most searing of my life.I walked the grounds along the barbed wire and railway tracks, through the iconic gates and buildings.. I got a sense of the scale of the place, of the geography.  Something that had always been somewhat abstract to me, became that afternoon very - and all too horrifically - substantial.  I wandered the vast Birkenau compound past the small ponds still gray and clouded with the ashes of hundreds of thousands.  I witnessed the piles of shoes, glasses, suitcases.. The hair shorn in a great heap..  Relics of the thousands of victims murdered at the very end of the war.  I stood by the rubble of the gas chambers, blown to slag by the SS as the Soviets bore down on them in the very last days of the Reich..I stood and gazed up at the cruel sneering mendacious ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" - that famous motto borrowed from Dachau emblazoned in steel wire above the entrance - with fresh eyes, as if for the first time.The nightmare was overwhelming.  I wandered about mute, not sure how to process any of it.As I left, I stopped in the gift shop, and bought this film.  I watched it in my hotel that night.  It brought everything I had seen that day into clearer focus.Watching beforehand would of course have been better, for this film's strength is that it re-enacts many of the crucial moments in the history of the place:  it's architectural expansion, the principal personalities involved, the larger political and historical context.  It gives a decent sense of how the original Polish army cavalry barracks and parade ground that formed the germinal nucleus of Auschwitz I was developed initially into a concentration camp for Polish political prisoners, and then incrementally grew into something far more ambitious and monstrous.  With the beginning of the war with the Soviet Union, many of the 2 to 3 million Soviet prisoners taken that first year were funneled through Auschwitz, where they were brutally worked and starved to death.At this point Himmler and the industrial giant IG Farbin decided to expand the complex, creating an SS command complex and a huge industrial park run by slave labor that grew up about the original concentration camp dubbed Auschwitz III.All of this seems relatively banal, compared to what came next.  The narrative expands to describe the relatively halting and ""small"" scale atrocities that the Wehrmacht and SS began committing throughout the newly conquered Baltic, Ukrainian and Belorussian territories.  Himmler was concerned, because he felt that the process of butchering Jews and other undesirables in groups of dozens and hundreds and thousands with rifles was both inefficient and ""too brutalizing"" to those committing the acts.  The wizards of the SS Einzatzgruppen death squads began to devise various solutions.  They actually experimented with blowing a few groups up with explosives, before deciding that the resulting rain of viscera and body parts was too gruesome even for Nazis..Carbon Monoxide, then other gases were tried.  They finally hit upon Zyklon B, a gas previously used to exterminate lice and rodents, as the suitable tool to murder millions with industrial efficiency. The ""gas shower"" technique had been already developed by doctors at asylums back in Germany before the war.  The technique had been used to euthanize tens of thousands of mentally and physically handicapped..And so it went.  The machinations and insanely hideous essential details are laid out with relentless spare economy.  The narrative is relentless, leaving one nauseous and aghast.  It tells the history of the entire Holocaust through the prism of of the evolution of the camp.The story of the Nazis is mostly depicted with actors reenacting the story..  Contemporary footage of the locations, interviews with several dozen camp survivors and other witnesses, along with some vintage film footage and photos help carry the story along.  The Germans are presented in their twisted humanity - socializing with one another, playing with their families - all while feeling their way forward with demonic clownishness as they organize the industrial genocide of millions.There are even several former SS men who inexplicably agreed to be interviewed.  Clear eyed octogenarians who gaze steadily at the camera, as they admit their continuing antisemitism and describe how they personally participated in the butchery.Astonishing.  Is there a statute of limitations on genocide?We listen to how they describe feeling nothing as they shot prisoners, and then tell how they still hate Jews and consider Slavs to be backward.  ""The French had toilets in their homes, but the Russians.. They for the most part had only outhouses behind their houses..""  This was apparently rationale enough to exterminate them by the hundreds of thousands after they surrendered.As I finished watching this again this afternoon for the first time since I returned from Poland, memories of that accursed place flooded back.  I've been feeling queasy and vaguely homicidal since.  I'm a borderline pacifist, but I gotta say watching unrepentant Nazis spew venom brings dark thoughts..In lieu of venting my anger in a truly satisfying way such as enlisting with Patton to go shoot some fascists, I have to settle for typing this review.The history so competently detailed in this film must be remembered.  I give it my highest recommendation.

Now I really want to go and I am glad (ha) it is in Poland and not Germany because I NEVER want to visit Germany.  I just don't think the world is safe from them.I have never been interested in the facts about the Holocaust because I always felt it was no use knowing the details - not because it is over but because no one is going to do anything further about it.  There is NO justice for piepels and the other victims but reading about Moni has changed my attitude about the Germans and the Holocaust and WIHOUT reading Piepel, this BBC documentary series shortchanges the representation of the Holocaust once again.  It does not convey the horrors of Auschwitz but if you have already read about Moni, then that impression may prevail as it does with me and this series will merely flesh out some of the details.There is more focus on how the different European governments handled the Nazi demand for Jews and it looks like everyone is guilty.  Slovakia stands out because it paid the Nazis to take away Slovakian Jews and Christian Slovaks took over their property and became rich.  The Germans and Slovakians have no problem describing the SCREAMS of the Jews as they were being killed just as they have no problem declaring that they felt justified in hating Jews.And that they enjoyed happy camaderie with their fellow SS soldiers - babies ... not so much.""I saw another SS soldier grab the baby by the legs. The crying had bothered him. He smashed the baby's head against the iron side of a truck until it was silent.""I would say that this is an EASY series to watch.  It is enhanced with the usual BBC style of presenting facts in that accent of theirs but it absolutely fails like most Holocaust documentaries and even Schindler's List to really make you feel it the wayThe Human CentipedeandHostel (Unrated Widescreen Cut)are able to do.So it's educational including many of the details like the excrement covering the stairs of the children's barracks and some of the other details when the Germans knowingly overcrowded the quarters to create FATAL situations at every turn of the imprisonment.But you need to read Piepel aka Moni.

877531,A5XNVUPFUDRZC,B000777JH8,HolocaustHistory channel,"[2, 8]","Laurence Rees' Auschwitz documentary was much promoted as a definitive refutation to ""holocaust deniers."" That is, it was supposed to refute people who say that Auschwitz was a labor camp rather than an extermination camp, and who prefer to believe the records of the Auschwitz death books and the British decodes of intercepted mesages sent from Auschwitz rather than stories told by postwar witnesses coordinated by the allies.Though Rees does a competent job in telling the traditional Auschwitz story, he fails completely in refuting ""deniers.""  Not only does he fail to engage with the arguments and evidence they put forward, but he also makes his case on the basis of extraordinarily shaky sources.Just seven minutes into the series we are shown a fraudulent athocity photo, specifically the famous ""tree hanging photo"" from Buchenwald, which was actually created in 1958 for an East German (i.e. communist) propaganda film. [Reference: Obenaus, Herbert. ""Das Foto vom Baumh&auml;ngen - ein Bild geht um die Welt,"" Gedenkst&auml;tten-Rundbrief, no. 68, October 1995, pp. 3-8.]Rees truly has no scruple about using dubious sources.  Much of his story is based on the confessions of Rudolf H&ouml;ss, the first commandant of Auschwitz.  But it is well known that Hoess' confessions were extracted through torture. For instance, consider the account of Bernard Clarke inLegions of Death: ""The prisoner was torn from the top bunk, the pyjamas ripped from his body. He was then dragged naked to one of the slaughter tables, where it seemed to Clarke the blows and screams were endless. Eventually, the Medical Officer urged the Captain: 'Call them off, unless you want to take back a corpse.'"" Clarke adds that it took three days (during which H&ouml;ss was not allowed to sleep) to get a statement out of him. [More information can be found in the article ""How the British Obtained the Confessions of Rudolf H&ouml;ss"" by Robert Faurisson.]Even more outrageously, the transcript of the film, as available on PBS' website for the series, inserts the phrase ""I have seen the gas chambers"" into Oscar Groening's speech near the end of episode 6.  Yet anyone who watches the documentary knows he didn't say that; the transcript shamelessly interpolates something Groening did not say!  Is there no fraud to which the holocaust industry will not stoop to promote their signature product?I've mentioned only a tiny fraction of the distortions and deceptions of this series, but this review is long enough already.  If the series is so bad, why the second star?  Well, I'm very fond of some of the music used, in particular the Handel sarabande played at the end of each episode.  So 2 bonus stars for Handel, 0 stars for the ""documentary.""

First, it was ""The Nazis"" series, based on the research of Sir Ian Kershaw, an eminent British authority on Hitler, that looked at how this ruling party contributed significantly to the rapid demise of the Third Reich. Now we have this series that examines the German war effort as it relates to its program of mass extermination in the main camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau between 1941-45. In this five-hour-long special assessment of the Final Solution, as it re-enacts the daily administration of this notorious death camp, the viewers see the Holocaust unfold before their very eyes. Everything gets covered here from the running of the camp by Hoess and his SS henchmen to the orders coming down from Himmler and Frank to the horrid conditions that inmates suffered to logistics of running this evil operation. The dramatizations of key moments when Auschwitz changed from a basic internment camp to a death factory and times when life among the personnel appeared normal are very realistic. Additionally, the testimonies of numerous Jewish survivors are very effectively included in the running commentary. What I learned from watching this presentation is that the Final Solution became the outcome of a state that had long lost its moral compass when it came to pursuing total war. Led by the SS, this program of mass extermination grew into something so unimaginably wicked because Nazi culture promoted the need to treat its enemies ruthlessly in order to promote the myth of the Aryan super-race. Jews, Slavs and Gypsies were the first of its victims, and it only remained for technology to kick in with a speedier way to complete the job.",5,The Death Camp of all Death Camps,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,1805,"['Once', 'again', 'BBC', 'done', 'spectacular', 'job', 'producing', 'DVD', 'series', 'WW', 'II', 'facet', 'conflict', 'Axis', 'perspective', 'First', 'was', 'Nazis', 'series', 'based', 'research', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'Kershaw', 'eminent', 'British', 'authority', 'Hitler', 'looked', 'how', 'ruling', 'party', 'contributed', 'significantly', 'rapid', 'demise', 'Third', 'Reich', 'Now', 'have', 'series', 'German', 'war', 'effort', 'program', 'mass', 'extermination', 'main', 'camp', 'Auschwitz-Birkenau', '1941-45', 'five-hour-long', 'special', 'assessment', 'Final', 'Solution', 'daily', 'administration', 'notorious', 'death', 'camp', 'viewers', 'see', 'Holocaust', 'unfold', 'very', 'eyes', 'Everything', 'covered', 'here', 'running', 'camp', 'Hoess', 'SS', 'henchmen', 'orders', 'coming', 'down', 'Himmler', 'Frank', 'horrid', 'conditions', 'suffered', 'logistics', 'running', 'evil', 'operation', 'dramatizations', 'key', 'moments', 'when', 'Auschwitz', 'changed', 'basic', 'internment', 'camp', 'death', 'factory', 'times', 'when', 'life', 'personnel', 'appeared', 'normal', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'Additionally', 'testimonies', 'numerous', 'Jewish', 'survivors', 'are', 'very', 'effectively', 'included', 'running', 'commentary', 'What', 'learned', 'watching', 'presentation', 'Final', 'Solution', 'became', 'outcome', 'state', 'had', 'long', 'lost', 'moral', 'compass', 'when', 'came', 'pursuing', 'total', 'war', 'Led', 'SS', 'program', 'mass', 'extermination', 'grew', 'something', 'so', 'unimaginably', 'wicked', 'Nazi', 'culture', 'promoted', 'need', 'treat', 'enemies', 'ruthlessly', 'order', 'promote', 'myth', 'Aryan', 'super-race', 'Jews', 'Slavs', 'Gypsies', 'were', 'first', 'victims', 'only', 'remained', 'technology', 'kick', 'speedier', 'way', 'complete', 'job']",N/A

Michael Click,"[114, 118]","Movie: *****  DVD Transfer: *****  Extras: *****A unique and highly informative 6-part documentary that examines the establishment and development of the Auschwitz-Birkenow concentration camp within the historical context of the Nazi's changing strategies and goals during the Second World War.  Using historical photographs, filmed re-enactments, recent interviews with both survivors and perpetrators, and computer models based on recently discovered blueprints of the camp, the filmmakers painstakingly trace the evolution of Auschwitz from a detainee facility built to house Polish prisoners, to a forced labor camp, and finally, to an infamous and horrifyingly efficient factory devoted to mass murder.  Brilliantly and movingly narrated by actress Linda Hunt (Oscar-winner for ""The Year of Living Dangerously""), the 4-1/2 hour series is intellectually stimulating, educationally astonishing, and emotionally overwhelming as it attempts the almost impossible task of explaining the incomprehensible.  That ""Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State"" succeeds so well in its mission is a testament to the commitment and skill of the filmmakers.The DVD also includes a revealing interview with filmmaker Lawrence Rees, who produced the series; and a series of six short interview segments with Holocaust and genocide authorities, each of which is hosted by esteemed journalist Linda Ellerbee.  These interviews, originally designed to air as companion pieces to the six parts of the documentary, are invaluable tools in providing modern day context to the lessons and legacy of Auschwitz, and a framework in which to consider the ongoing horror of genocide.

This was very interesting and beneficial in gaining an overall view of  what the original camp looked like and what each area was designed for.Although I have read many books and seen many videos on this subject, I found this particular one most insightful. The interviews were stirring and went beyond recorded fact by asking hard questions to both those who committed the crimes as well as those who were imprisoned and committed crimes against their fellow inmates. This DVD is over four hours long, but fascinating enough to keep ones attention. As hard as it is to watch videos documenting these events, I feel it is important to know what took place because this event greatly impacted so many people and is currently under attack by deniers.

877556,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000777JH8,Z Hayes,"[3, 3]","Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State makes for compelling viewing. It  is divided into 6 chapters. The first chapter is titled ""Surprising Beginnings"" which basically introduces us to the origins of Auschwitz and how it was not initially designated as an extermination camp for Jews, but basically to house Polish political prisoners and later Russian POWs. In fact, the first gassing experiments in the camp were targeted at the Russian POWs.In the second chapter ""Orders and Initiatives"", we learn of the plans of Hitler, Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich to kill the Jews on a massive scale. Auschwitz is prepped for this purpose by the construction of gas chambers and the use of Zyklon B, a form of poisonous gas that was initially used to exterminate vermin and a disinfecting agent. We also learn about the Lodz Ghetto and its infamous Jewish leader, Rumkowski who seemed a controversial character in oppressing his own people, though not spared death himself, in the end. The crude initial gas chambers at Auschwitz are also shown, in reconstructions.In the third chapter ""Factories of Death"", the documentary explores how the systematic annihilation of the Jews was put into full operation, stretching all over Europe with Auschwitz being the center of extermination. The French authorities are also portrayed as being complicit in helping transport masses of Jews out of France to the ""east"". The other camps of death are also discussed such as Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor. It also mentions what happened to children of adult Jews who were sent off to work in the camps.The fourth chapter ""Corruption"" focusses on the blatant appropriation of murdered Jews and other peoples' belongings and valuables for the use of the Third Reich. Rudolf Hoess, the commandant of Auschwitz himself was removed from his position under charges of corruption [though he would return later to oversee mass killing on an astronomical scale]. This chapter also mentions Dr Josef Mengele, the infamous Nazi doctor of death, and also about the setting up of a brothel in the camp.  Most importantly, this episode also deals with the resistance against the Nazi oppressors, most famously the uprising in Sobibor.The fifth chapter ""Murder and Intrigue"" deals with the playing out of  international politics during the last nine months of 1944 and how nothing much was done by the Allies despite knowing by then that the jews and other innocents were being systematically and mechanically murdered by the Nazis.  This was much to the detriment of the Hungarian Jews in particular, for they were deported to their deaths at a time where the gas chambers and crematoriums at Auschwitz in particular were operating at their optimum capacity. It also focusses on the Sonderkommando, the Jewish inmates who were forced to help process new arrivals designated for gassing, collecting their possessions, and disposing of their corpses.The final chapter ""Liberation and Revenge"" deals with how the Nazis tried to conceal their atrocities towards the end of the war. It also covers some of the trials of the Nazi war criminals after the war, the impact of liberation on the surviving camp inmates etc.Each chapter has at the end an interview between Linda Ellerbee with various personalities, mainly members of faculty of universities about the issues raised by each chapter.The series is not only well-put together with the extensive research compiled, but also the reenactments of historical events with actors and actresses [which I felt enhanced the series and not detract from it], the computer generated graphics of the camps as they were [they are mainly ruins now], and also most importantly, the testaments of the survivors in the present. It is a truly heartwrenching experience to see and hear these brave souls relive their horrific memories of such a bleak period in the history of mankind. A must-watch. I would also recommend ""Shoah"", a documentary that has more testimonies by survivors on the horrors they endured during the second world war.",5,A riveting series that explores Auschwitz and the Nazi implementation of the Final Solution,1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,4028,"['Auschwitz', 'Nazi', 'State', 'compelling', 'viewing', 'divided', '6', 'chapters', 'first', 'chapter', 'titled', 'Surprising', 'Beginnings', 'basically', 'origins', 'Auschwitz', 'how', 'was', 'not', 'initially', 'designated', 'extermination', 'camp', 'Jews', 'basically', 'house', 'Polish', 'political', 'prisoners', 'later', 'Russian', 'POWs', 'fact', 'first', 'gassing', 'experiments', 'camp', 'were', 'targeted', 'Russian', 'POWs.In', 'second', 'chapter', 'Orders', 'Initiatives', 'learn', 'plans', 'Hitler', 'Himmler', 'Reinhard', 'Heydrich', 'kill', 'Jews', 'massive', 'scale', 'Auschwitz', 'prepped', 'purpose', 'construction', 'gas', 'chambers', 'use', 'Zyklon', 'B', 'form', 'poisonous', 'gas', 'was', 'initially', 'used', 'exterminate', 'vermin', 'disinfecting', 'agent', 'also', 'learn', 'Lodz', 'Ghetto', 'infamous', 'Jewish', 'leader', 'Rumkowski', 'who', 'seemed', 'controversial', 'character', 'oppressing', 'own', 'people', 'not', 'spared', 'death', 'end', 'crude', 'initial', 'gas', 'chambers', 'Auschwitz', 'are', 'also', 'shown', 'reconstructions.In', 'third', 'chapter', 'Factories', 'Death', 'documentary', 'how', 'systematic', 'annihilation', 'Jews', 'was', 'put', 'full', 'operation', 'stretching', 'Europe', 'Auschwitz', 'being', 'center', 'extermination', 'French', 'authorities', 'are', 'also', 'portrayed', 'being', 'complicit', 'helping', 'transport', 'masses', 'Jews', 'France', 'east', 'other', 'camps', 'death', 'are', 'also', 'discussed', 'such', 'Treblinka', 'Belzec', 'Sobibor', 'also', 'what', 'happened', 'children', 'adult', 'Jews', 'who', 'were', 'sent', 'off', 'work', 'camps.The', 'fourth', 'chapter', 'Corruption', 'blatant', 'appropriation', 'murdered', 'Jews', 'other', 'peoples', 'belongings', 'valuables', 'use', 'Third', 'Reich', 'Rudolf', 'Hoess', 'commandant', 'Auschwitz', 'was', 'removed', 'position', 'charges', 'corruption', '[', 'would', 'return', 'later', 'oversee', 'mass', 'killing', 'astronomical', 'scale', ']', 'chapter', 'also', 'Dr', 'Josef', 'Mengele', 'infamous', 'Nazi', 'doctor', 'death', 'also', 'setting', 'up', 'brothel', 'camp', 'Most', 'importantly', 'episode', 'also', 'resistance', 'Nazi', 'oppressors', 'most', 'famously', 'uprising', 'Sobibor.The', 'fifth', 'chapter', 'Murder', 'Intrigue', 'deals', 'playing', 'international', 'politics', 'last', 'nine', 'months', '1944', 'how', 'nothing', 'much', 'was', 'done', 'Allies', 'knowing', 'then', 'jews', 'other', 'innocents', 'were', 'being', 'systematically', 'mechanically', 'murdered', 'Nazis', 'was', 'much', 'detriment', 'Hungarian', 'Jews', 'particular', 'were', 'deported', 'deaths', 'time', 'where', 'gas', 'chambers', 'crematoriums', 'Auschwitz', 'particular', 'were', 'operating', 'optimum', 'capacity', 'also', 'Sonderkommando', 'Jewish', 'inmates', 'who', 'were', 'forced', 'help', 'process', 'new', 'arrivals', 'designated', 'gassing', 'collecting', 'possessions', 'disposing', 'corpses.The', 'final', 'chapter', 'Liberation', 'Revenge', 'deals', 'how', 'Nazis', 'tried', 'conceal', 'atrocities', 'end', 'war', 'also', 'trials', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminals', 'war', 'impact', 'liberation', 'surviving', 'camp', 'inmates', 'etc.Each', 'chapter', 'end', 'interview', 'Linda', 'Ellerbee', 'various', 'personalities', 'mainly', 'members', 'faculty', 'universities', 'issues', 'raised', 'chapter.The', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'well-put', 'together', 'extensive', 'research', 'compiled', 'also', 'reenactments', 'historical', 'events', 'actors', 'actresses', '[', 'felt', 'enhanced', 'series', 'not', 'detract', ']', 'computer', 'generated', 'graphics', 'camps', 'were', '[', 'are', 'mainly', 'ruins', 'now', ']', 'also', 'most', 'importantly', 'testaments', 'survivors', 'present', 'truly', 'heartwrenching', 'experience', 'see', 'hear', 'brave', 'souls', 'relive', 'horrific', 'memories', 'such', 'bleak', 'period', 'history', 'mankind', 'must-watch', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'Shoah', 'documentary', 'more', 'testimonies', 'survivors', 'horrors', 'endured', 'second', 'world', 'war']",N/A
