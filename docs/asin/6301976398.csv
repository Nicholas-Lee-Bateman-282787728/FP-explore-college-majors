285590,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6301976398,Dr. James Gardner,"[3, 3]","There is only one Tarzan and he is Johnny Weissmuller, introduced to the world in 1932 in ""Tarzan the Ape Man"", the first of 12 films to star Weissmuller. He wasn't the first (Elmo Lincoln had the distinction in 1918), nor was he the only Tarzan during his reign from 1932 to 1948 (Buster Crabbe played him in a 12 part series called ""Tarzan the Fearless"" and Bruce Bennett did the same in 1937 under the title ""The New Adventures of Tarzan""), but he is the most memorable. Lex Barker succeeded him in 1949 to 1953 with 5 films and Gordon Scott followed Baxter from 1955 to 1960 with 6 films, and the most memorable performance among his competitors was Christopher Lambert in ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"" (1984).Johnny Weissmuller was a world champion swimmer, holder of 67 world records, and winner of 6 Olympic medals (5 gold and 1 bronze). He went from swimming to modeling swim wear and appearing on radio shows, and then to film where he first appeared as Adonis wearing only a fig leaf. Tarzan was his second film. He went on to do 11 more, then traded in his loin cloth for a safari suit and became ""Jungle Jim"" (1948) who he played in 13 films between 1948 and 1953. In 1956 Jungle Jim jumped to the small screen where he stayed until 1958.If Johnny is our only Tarzan, the beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan is our only Jane. She played Jane 6 times between 1932 and 1942, but unlike Weissmuller, she played many other roles during that time, including ""Tugboat Annie"" (1933), ""The Thin Man"" (1934), ""Cardinal Richelieu"" (1935), ""A Day at the Races"" (1937), ""A Yank at Oxford"" (1938), and ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1940). She slowed down in the 40s to devote time to her husband and 7 children, one of whom is the actress Mia Farrow.The film features C. Aubrey Smith, Neil Hamilton, Forrester Harvey, and Jiggs.C. Aubrey Smith was a marvelous actor known for his roles as an aristocrat. He appeared in more than 100 films from 1915 to 1949. He gave us memorable roles in a host of films, including Major Hamilton in ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935), Lord Capulet in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1936), and Colonel Zapt in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" (1937). I remember him best as Col. Williams in ""Wee Willie Winkie"" (1937) with Shirley Temple. Smith plays Jane's father.Neil Hamilton plays Jane's suitor. He's best remembered as Commissioner Gordon from the Batman TV series (1966-8), but he appeared in  nearly 100 films between 1918 and 1949 when he made the transition to TV. He appeared in ""Dawn Patrol"" (1930) and several ""Fun Manchu"" films (1929, 1930) as well as reprising his role of Harry Holt in the 1934 ""Tarzan and his Mate.""Forrester Harvey makes a brief appearance as a shop owner. Harvey appeared in more than 100 films from 1922 to 1946, often as comic relief in horror films like ""The Invisible Man"" (1933), ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" (1935), ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (1941), and ""The Wolfman"" (1941).  He has the distinction of appearing in all the Dickens' films of the 1930s. He reprised his role in the 1934 ""Tarzan and his Mate.""Jiggs plays Cheeta. Cheeta was not a part of the original book, but appeared in almost all the Tarzan films beginning with this one. Jiggs played the original Cheetah and appeared in the follow up ""Tarzan and his Mate"" (1934) and then left Johnny and Maureen to appear in the Buster Crabbe series. Never known for his loyalty, Jiggs then jumped ship and appeared in Tarzan films with Herman Brix. He died in 1938 at the age of 9.Woody van Dyke directs. Best known for his ""Thin Man"" films, for which he received an Oscar nomination in 1935, he also received a nomination for ""San Francisco"" (1936) and directed Nelson Eddy and Jeanette Macdonald in 6 of their films. Van Dyke enjoyed exotic locations and made such films as ""Heart of the Yukon"" (1927), ""White Shadows in the South Seas"" (1928), ""Eskimo"" (1933), ""Northwest Passage"" (1940) and ""Cairo"" (1942). Stock footage taken from van Dyke's ""Trader Horn"" (1931) is used in the Tarzan film.The film is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' novels. Burroughs invented the multi-media marketing that is so common today, but in 1915 when he proposed expanding the Tarzan character into comic strips, films and merchandise, the idea was revolutionary. (FWIW - his ranch near Los Angeles was re-named Tarzana in honor of his novels).The idea of Tarzan comes from the ""wild boy"" literature that was popular in the 19th Century, and Burroughs specifically acknowledged the influence of Rudyard Kipling's ""Mowgli"" from ""The Jungle Book"" (1894). This movement is a reaction to the problems of industrialization and praises the ""simple life"". We see related influences in the whole food movement associated with Kellogg's Battle Creek Sanitarium, the wild children of India, the wild boy of Aveyron, etc. We see the struggle between civilization and nature in 1933's ""King Kong"" in which the giant ape who lives well in the jungle is destroyed by the city.  At the time Burroughs was writing, there was an enormous debate in the U.S. concerning the relative contribution of genetics vs. environment, and the back story for the Tarzan novel addresses this precisely.The 1932 film differs from the book because Burroughs had sold the sound film rights. So Irving Thalberg changed the story, made the principals come from England rather than the U.S., took out the back story, and added Cheetah.The first Tarzan (1918) earned nearly $1 million dollars which was an extraordinary amount for those times when there were few picture shows and the cost of a show was a nickel. The 1932 version was equally well received, and before long, every kid in America was waking up his parents with the Tarzan call of the wild. The film increased the sales of the comics and gave birth to a radio show that debuted on September 10, sponsored by Sinclair Oil, who then sold puzzles and mugs at their gas stations.The film uses a lot of stock footage, not well integrated. At one point, Smith and O'Sullivan are standing in front of natives who appear as big as giants. There are also a lot of poorly constructed animals that appear periodically, and the guys in chimp suits are all too obvious. About mid way in the film, Tarzan wrestles with a stuffed leopard. While some leeway can be given because this is 1932, you also have to consider that ""King Kong"" appeared in 1933 with none of these types of problems.From a 21st century perspective, there are also problems with the treatment of natives, the wanton killing of animals, etc. All of this is politically incorrect today, but is well within the bounds of acceptability for the 1930s, much less 1912 when the novel appeared.Laying aside the production and political problems, this is a great love story, set against the background of action and adventure in the wilds. The film is sexy, funny, and touching.",5,Classic,1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,6855,"['only', 'one', 'Tarzan', 'Johnny', 'Weissmuller', 'introduced', 'world', '1932', 'Tarzan', 'Ape', 'Man', 'first',

285592,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,6301976398,Israel Drazin,"[1, 2]","This 1932 classic is the first film about Tarzan that starred Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan. It was Maureen O'Sullivan's first movie. She received fourth billing, although today she has second billing on any ad about the film. Weissmuller starred in six Tarzan films with her and later with other actresses until the studio felt it wanted a younger star to play Tarzan. He never played in any non-Tarzan film. While O'Sullivan starred in dozens of movies, she is best known for her role as Jane. Contrary to what some people imagine, Tarzan and Jane never married in the Weissmuller-O'Sullivan Tarzan movies.The film is somewhat grainy. The acting is a bit heavy handed, as it is in most 1930 films. When the white actors are shown in the same scene with African tribe people and when Jane runs from an animal, it appears that they are standing in front of a movie screen. Nevertheless, the film is very interesting.The story focuses on hunters searching for the elephants' burial ground, so that they can sell the ivory for millions, and on the pampered daughter of one of the hunters, who needs more than soap and water to wash her face, who traveled 6,000 mile to Africa to join her father, who brought six enormous suitcases with clothes with her, who wants to participate in the search for the ivory, and her relationship in the wild jungle with the ape man who only mimics some words she says and only understands the words ""Jane"" and ""Tarzan."" She undergoes several adventures with Tarzan, the final one is when she and the hunters are captured by dwarfs who want to kill them by throwing them into a pit containing a huge gorilla.It is interesting to see and hear Tarzan use his famous Tarzan yell in dangerous situations. However, it is puzzling how any animals can distinguish what seems to be a single cry to mean, at different times, ""stop attacking the hunters,"" ""I need help,"" ""here I am,"" and ""come carry me.""",5,A very entertainig film,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,1936,"['1932', 'classic', 'first', 'film', 'Tarzan', 'starred', 'Johnny', 'Weissmuller', 'Maureen', ""O'Sullivan"", 'was', 'Maureen', ""O'Sullivan"", 'first', 'movie', 'received', 'fourth', 'billing', 'today', 'second', 'billing', 'ad', 'film', 'Weissmuller', 'starred', 'six', 'Tarzan', 'films', 'later', 'other', 'actresses', 'studio', 'felt', 'wanted', 'younger', 'star', 'play', 'Tarzan', 'never', 'played', 'non-Tarzan', 'film', ""O'Sullivan"", 'starred', 'dozens', 'movies', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'Jane', 'Contrary', 'what', 'people', 'imagine', 'Tarzan', 'Jane', 'never', 'married', ""Weissmuller-O'Sullivan"", 'Tarzan', 'movies.The', 'film', 'somewhat', 'grainy', 'acting', 'bit', 'heavy', 'handed', 'most', '1930', 'films', 'When', 'white', 'actors', 'are', 'shown', 'same', 'scene', 'African', 'tribe', 'people', 'when', 'Jane', 'animal', 'are', 'standing', 'front', 'movie', 'screen', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'very', 'interesting.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'hunters', 'searching', 'elephants', 'burial', 'ground', 'can', 'sell', 'ivory', 'millions', 'pampered', 'daughter', 'one', 'hunters', 'who', 'more', 'soap', 'water', 'wash', 'face', 'who', 'traveled', '6,000', 'mile', 'Africa', 'join', 'father', 'who', 'brought', 'six', 'enormous', 'suitcases', 'clothes', 'who', 'participate', 'search', 'ivory', 'relationship', 'wild', 'jungle', 'ape', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'words', 'only', 'words', 'Jane', 'Tarzan', 'several', 'adventures', 'Tarzan', 'final', 'one', 'when', 'hunters', 'are', 'captured', 'dwarfs', 'who', 'want', 'kill', 'throwing', 'pit', 'containing', 'huge', 'gorilla.It', 'interesting', 'see', 'hear', 'Tarzan', 'use', 'famous', 'Tarzan', 'yell', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'However', 'puzzling', 'how', 'animals', 'can', 'distinguish', 'what', 'be', 'single', 'cry', 'mean', 'different', 'times', 'stop', 'attacking', 'hunters', 'need', 'help', 'here', 'am', 'come', 'carry']",Tarzan The Ape Man 1943  VHS
285593,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6301976398,Monty Moonlight,"[8, 9]","Olympic Swimming Champion Johnny Weissmuller portrays probably the most ""classic"" Tarzan to date, in this wonderful 1932 film that, despite its age, is incredibly entertaining even now! The lovely and modern Jane Parker has come to Africa to spend time with her father, James Parker, a trader who is preoccupied with the idea of finding a legendary elephant graveyard and the ivory riches it would hold. Along with James' partner, Harry, who has his heart set on winning Jane, the father and daughter embark on an expedition into the African Jungle to search for the sacred place. Within the jungle, they encounter natives that give them the impression that they are on the right track. However, they also encounter something rather strange, a wild man raised by chimpanzees! The wild man immediately kidnaps the lovely Jane, and in time they grow quite attached to each other. Tarzan is completely fascinated with this female that looks so much better than an ape-girl, and Jane is in complete bliss to have found a hunky brute who is obsessed with her and understands nothing she says. But their romance is interrupted when Jane, Harry, and her father are taken prisoner by Pygmies, and it's up to Tarzan to save them, with a little help from his best friend Cheetah, the chimp. Tarzan, the Ape Man is full of classic adventure, danger, humor, and fun, like only a 1930's classic can provide. The film gets a bit violent and racy for its era, and there are definitely some surprising moments. It's amusing to see how, in some scenes, the actors pretend to interact with natives that are really just stock footage running on a screen behind them. It's also fascinating to see dwarfs in black make-up, pretending to be pygmies, and live-elephants with fake ears to make them appear African. There are several funny things to point out in this movie. I watched this the other night on cable with my dad, who saw the film in the theater in his youth, and was amused to hear him say several times, somewhat embarrassed, ""They fooled us all with that when we were kids!""",5,A true classic!

285594,A3RD5BAVYUUY0P,6301976398,Mykola,"[1, 1]","When I was a kid you could always depend on seeing a Tarzan movie on TV on a Saturday afternoon.  Just because there were basically 3 stations back then (we were so impressed when 2 or 3 more were added...), we watched them all.  After seeing them all, I knew to be disappointed if they showed a Tarzan movie without Johnny Weissmuller.  My husband was always amazed that after all those years I still remembered all the dialogue.  I still have so much fun watching these old movies.  For a while you just didn't see them on TV anymore - I was told that people had decided that they were racist - well, that is just silly.  Then one weekend in the 90s AMC had a Tarzan marathon - Johnny W. only, of course - and I taped it all.  I had 10 tapes full of ALL of those wonderful movies, and I still have a working VCR.  Then one weekend I was trying to get rid of much stuff as possible.  I had a flood after a pipe broke and just got into cleaning and trying to downsize all of my stuff.  After it was too late I realized that I had accidentally thrown out all but four of those tapes.  I wanted to either cry or slap myself, one of the two.  I still need to watch those tapes and see which movies I still have left - I just haven't had the heart to do it.SO - I would love to see every Tarzan/Johnny W. movie ever made on DVD.  I would buy them all.  As most Tarzan fans know, Johnny Weissmuller was an Olympic swimmer and he yodeled as a hobby.  Hence the strong lungs that let him to do the only decent Tarzan yell ever.  They used that tape for the rest of the movies with the ""fake Tarzans"" for years.  I believe they still used it when they made a Tarzan TV show years ago.Another bit of trivia I love about these movies is that it was filmed in Florida where I am from.  I don't know if they were ever captured for whatever reason, but for years there were monkeys that had escaped during the filming and they lived in the woods around that area in Florida, reproducing.As a kid I was fascinated by that incredible man who lived in the jungle and was able to commune with and always get help from the animals - the elephants, the apes that raised him;  and then when he ended up with a wife and son, and they lived in that incredible treehouse - well, that was it.  I was jealous of Boy.  I wanted to be Girl.  That was my daydream - to have Tarzan and Jane as parents and live in that jungle in that treehouse.And Jane?  I merely tolerated the ""Janes"" that came when Maureen O'Sullivan stopped doing the movie.  She was quoted as saying that she hated doing those movies and that Cheetah bit her on numerous occassions.  She was so beautiful, and I think it is so cool that the censors let that first movie slide - the outfits and the nude swim in the river.  Oh, what a joy, to see Tarzan and family go for their daily swim.I have to say that my favorite has to be Tarzan in New York.  That was SO cool.  To this day there is still debate over whether or not Johnny really did jump off of the Brooklyn Bridge.  I steadfastly believe that he did.If you are an old fan or have never seen Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan, I highly recommend it.  Definitely start out with the earliest, and as you watch the later ones with a different Jane, I am sure you will do as I always have - simply tolerate her and concentrate on Tarzan and that wonderful world where there are no rules except the rules of survival - and Tarzan always saves the day and takes his family home to that marvelous treehouse high above the jungle.Thes movies are exciting, interesting, VERY well made, especially for that era - but most of all they are just plain fun.As for the people who try to call these movies ""racist"" - when did Tarzan get upset and know that there was going to be trouble?

285596,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,6301976398,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 0]","I grew up watching these films, in the 1960s when racial mores were very under-developed compared to today.  Sure, the film medium has advanced technically, but also hugely in terms of sophistication and awareness of different cultures and moral systems.  So it was something of a gamble that I would enjoy this like I did back then.I am happy to say that the magic truly comes through, in spite of its being dated.  Weissmuller is brilliant as the mysterious ape man, who has mastered survival in the jungle, in particular with the metal knife that he wields with such precision, but also in his rapport with the animals that answer his call.  The tone remains one of mystery and exoticism, with views of intelligent elephants and a sophisticated society of chimps.In terms of plot, a young and winsome Jane intrudes into her father's career as an ivory hunter, popping up unannounced and ebullient with life (and, yes, inchoate sexual energy).  Her father's apprentice associate is smitten with her, a primitive man of action ready to shoot anything is his way.  They set out to find the elephant's graveyard, in the uncharted bush.  It takes them directly into Tarzan territory, where Jane meets him as an abductee.  She is scared, but intrigued.  After an imbroglio that almost gets Tarzan killed, Jane is free to stay with him, initiating a series to explain his story.This is truly great fun, a classic cinematic experience that portrays an alien world in a great story with interesting characters.

The story is quite familiar now, so it seems trite and dull. However, this film is strangely entertaining although everyone knows what will happen in the film. Girl (Maureen O'Sullivan) goes along with her father on a trek to find the famed elephant graveyard and stumbles upon a man who lives in the wild like an ape (Johnny Weissmuller). The two are quite attracted to each other.Johnny Weissmuller is not an incredibly attractive man although he is Olympically trained and very fit. He has incredible chemistry with the baby-faced Maureen O'Sullivan; all of their scenes are sexually charged which makes this film really good. The story is primally sexual but incredibly romantic at the same time.This film was shot with soft lighting which only accentuates the beauty of the wild. Some footage of real natives was used and real animals were filmed for many of the scenes. This film looks realistic which only draws its audience in more.You might not expect much from a Tarzan film, but you really should; you might be surprised at how well it captures your imagination.",4,Great Adventure FIlm,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,1159,"['Ape', 'Man', 'first', 'film', 'most', 'popular', 'strain', 'Tarzan', 'series', 'story', 'quite', 'familiar', 'now', 'trite', 'dull', 'However', 'film', 'strangely', 'entertaining', 'everyone', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'film', 'Girl', 'Maureen', ""O'Sullivan"", 'father', 'trek', 'find', 'famed', 'elephant', 'graveyard', 'man', 'who', 'wild', 'ape', 'Johnny', 'Weissmuller', 'two', 'are', 'quite', 'attracted', 'other.Johnny', 'Weissmuller', 'not', 'incredibly', 'attractive', 'man', 'Olympically', 'trained', 'very', 'fit', 'incredible', 'chemistry', 'baby-faced', 'Maureen', ""O'Sullivan"", 'scenes', 'are', 'sexually', 'charged', 'film', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'primally', 'sexual', 'incredibly', 'romantic', 'same', 'time.This', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'soft', 'lighting', 'only', 'beauty', 'wild', 'footage', 'real', 'natives', 'was', 'used', 'real', 'animals', 'were', 'filmed', 'many', 'scenes', 'film', 'realistic', 'only', 'audience', 'more.You', 'might', 'not', 'expect', 'much', 'Tarzan', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'imagination']",Tarzan The Ape Man 1943  VHS

The photography is excellent and the elements in the story are imaginitive. Maureen O'Sullavan is a darling Irish colleen in this early (for her) picture and no one could equal Weissmuller's Tarzan yell. Neil Hamilton was such an inept ham actor (his ridiculous style was finally parodied to good use in the BATMAN TV series!) A sequel, made in 1934 entitled TARZAN AND HIS MATE is a lyric film which expresses the beauty and danger of the jungle; it's a romance of the highest order(!)
