310701,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302409829,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The original 1950 film starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor is one of the best films of the 50's.  It is smart and endearing and transcends mere comedic punch lines to deliver a finale that made me tear up and still remains a swell in my heart.  This 1990 remake starring Steve Martin is less impressive as a whole because it replaces the genuine sentiment with a layer of saccharine and then nixes the well timed wit for more abrasive and outlandish `laughs'.  It is a straightforward comedy, where the original was a smarter and more genuine experience.  That said, Steve Martin is at his best and he really delivers a strong comedic performance and he always handles the schmaltz with class.  Before I saw the original, I liked this film a lot more because in my eyes it was doing exactly what it set out to do, and in a sense it really is.  This isn't trying to be the original.  This is trying to be a more outlandish comedy in the same vein of the comedies popular in the early 90's.  That's why this film stars Steve Martin, Diane Keaton and Martin Short.  Spencer Tracy was just a different breed of actor and thus turned out a different breed of film.  Comparing the two films does this remake a disservice, because it cannot compare.  Judged on its own merits, it succeeds in a lot of ways, but it will always be somewhat tarnished in my eyes thanks to the magnificent 1950's classic.",3,More `haha funny' than genuinely witty...,1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,1401,"['original', '1950', 'film', 'starring', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'one', 'best', 'films', '50', 'smart', 'endearing', 'transcends', 'mere', 'comedic', 'punch', 'lines', 'deliver', 'finale', 'made', 'tear', 'up', 'still', 'swell', 'heart', '1990', 'remake', 'starring', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'less', 'impressive', 'whole', 'genuine', 'sentiment', 'layer', 'saccharine', 'then', 'nixes', 'well', 'timed', 'wit', 'more', 'abrasive', 'outlandish', 'laughs', 'straightforward', 'comedy', 'where', 'original', 'was', 'smarter', 'more', 'genuine', 'experience', 'said', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'best', 'really', 'strong', 'comedic', 'performance', 'always', 'schmaltz', 'class', 'saw', 'original', 'liked', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'eyes', 'was', 'doing', 'exactly', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'sense', 'really', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'original', 'trying', 'be', 'more', 'outlandish', 'comedy', 'same', 'vein', 'comedies', 'popular', 'early', '90', 'why', 'film', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Martin', 'Short', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'was', 'just', 'different', 'breed', 'actor', 'thus', 'turned', 'out', 'different', 'breed', 'film', 'Comparing', 'two', 'films', 'remake', 'disservice', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'Judged', 'own', 'merits', 'lot', 'ways', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'somewhat', 'tarnished', 'eyes', 'thanks', 'magnificent', '1950', 'classic']",Father of the Bride VHS

Forty-one years later,Steve Martin portrayed the father(his character is George Stanley Banks) and Kimberly Williams was Annie,the bride. Martin narrated the film,himself on camera in the first scene,dressed in the tuxedo he wore at Williams' wedding. Annie's romance with Bryan MacKenzie began six months before their wedding. Annie was studying architecture in Rome,where she met Bryan(George Newbern). According to the scene where Bryan went to the Banks' home to meet Annie's parents,Bryan went to Annie to ask for directions and one thing led to another. George left his workplace,Sidekicks,an athletic shoe factory which he runs,immediately after he was told that Annie had arrived home. For a homecoming gift,George buys her a ten-speed bike,all polished and ready to ride. Then,Annie announces her and Bryan's engagement at the dinner table to her father,her mother Nina(Diane Keaton) and her brother Matt(Kieran Culkin,MacCaulay's brother). George is very shocked,believing she's too young to get married(Annie is 22 and Bryan is 26). Bryan is an independent communications consultant,which he assembles and connects communication systems. Then,George and Nina go to the home of David and Joanna MacKenzie,Bryan's dad and mom. They toast the wedding of their respective children and other joyful events that will possibly follow(i.e. Annie's and Bryan's children). At one point in the film,a heated argument between Annie and Bryan causes them to split up and cancel the wedding. The Bankses meet with a wedding coordinator named Franc Eggelhoffer(Martin Short with a European accent). The glorious wedding day comes in early January,following a snowfall(a rarity in Los Angeles). Heaters were brought in and immediately taken out of the Banks' home,where the reception took place, since they were melting the ice sculptures. In the final scene,after the wedding,Annie phones her exhausted parents saying goodbye,&quot;I love you&quot; and &quot;thank you for everything&quot;. Annie and Bryan were at the airport where they were about to fly to their honeymoon in Hawaii. Those who have seen this film may have also seen &quot;Betsy's Wedding&quot; and &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot;. It was released in theatres just before Christmas 1991.

Dad, well, he doesn't know what to think. Kimberly Williams, as Annie the daughter, was a real find. She's pretty, cute, and talented. This is a role that Steve Martin seemed destined to play. He's such a brilliant comedian and comedic actor. He can play it straight just as well. He shines in this wonderful, warm, fuzzy comedy. Let's not forget Martin Short, as wedding coordinator Franc. Short is another comedy genius. He gives us an instantly memorable and classic performance. Just where exactly is Franc from?. Nobody really knows. The movie is incredible to look at.

310706,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,6302409829,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[1, 1]","A remake of a classic 1950 Spencer Tracy movie, Father Of The Bride is Steve Martin at his best. A fun comedy the entire family can enjoy, Father Of The Bride is great entertainment. When the daughter of George and Nina Banks announces her engagement, Nina is thrilled - but George has a difficult time handling the life changes that accompany his only daughter growing up for good. One of Steven Martin's funniest films, this is one movie you won't want to miss...George Banks (Steve Martin) lives the perfect life. He has a great job, a nice house, a beautiful loving wife Nina (Diane Keaton), and two great kids. But George's world is shattered when his 21-year-old daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) returns home from college to announce she's engaged. Her fianc&eacute;e, Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), is a great guy, but when he puts his hand on Annie's leg, all sorts of feelings and emotions erupt inside George. It isn't her choice of a marriage partner, but rather her decision to get married at all that bothers George. He wants his little girl to remain a little girl forever, and he must now face the fact that he can't control the changes in his ideal world...Father Of The Bride offers a number of hilarious scenes as plans for the wedding go forward. Annie and Nina hire an extremely feminine male wedding planner, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short), whose annoying accent and take-charge attitude continuously rub George the wrong way. Deciding to have the wedding at the family home, the Banks's daily lives are turned upside down by all the last minute changes and typical pitfalls of an impending wedding. These comic sequences leading up to the big event are responsible for most of the humor and hilarity in the film (especially Martin Short's character). But will the wedding go off as planned? Will George come to accept his daughter's growing up? Or will she break off her engagement to Bryan? Father Of The Bride is a touching, romantic comedy you'll never forget.Steve Martin stars as his usual likeable self, utilizing great body language and years of experience in the comic realm in order to provide the perfect likeness of a father in just such a situation. Not too over the top, and quite believable in every way, Father Of The Bride stands in stark contrast to the comedies of today which tend to go way overboard in their attempts to be funny. Outlandish comedies have their place, but sometimes its nice to able to laugh without having to suspend your sense of reality first. Father Of The Bride does well in this respect - similar to Christmas Vacation.Overall, Father Of The Bride is a light-hearted family comedy with quite a bit of charm. Steve Martin and Diane Keaton form a likeable married couple, and the middle-class family life projected by the Banks family is something with which most viewers can identify. Because of its feel-good, light-hearted humor, Father Of The Bride is a definite must-see movie...

When his young, beautiful daughter tells him at the dinner table that she's getting married, Steve Martin's reaction is both hilarious, and touching.Diane Keaton plays the level-headed wife, and mother of the bride. While George is still in shock over the wedding, he meets his future son-in-law, and new in-laws. As the movie progresses, the fun becomes laugh-out-loud family entertainment. As George begins to hang onto a very thin string, he agrees to plan the wedding with an off-the-wall wedding consultant, who loves George's charge cards. George's visit to the in-laws lands him in their pool, with two viscous dogs growling at him. To make matters worse, George completely looses it in the supermarket, which lands him in jail.The more you watch this movie, the more you laugh. Martin Short plays the perfect funny wedding consultant, who has you laughing in hysterics. The music of the sixties adds more fun, as the laughter continues.

The most touching scenes involve the simplest actions, like when Mr. Banks is given the chance to get rid of his prospective son-in-law when the intended couple have a tift.  Also, Martin's straightforward voice-over narration adds greatly to his characterization.This is a fun film, and is easily liked by many.

However, if you, like me, are a child of the '70s and used to more kick in your humor, then this is the movie for you... and who knows?

310724,A2KSU7OOJ5C479,6302409829,"Loren D. Morrison ""amateur_reviewer""","[1, 3]","Up front, I've got to admit that I'm probably less qualified to review a movie than many of the other reviewers here.  I don't see that many movies, and I have no idea if a transfer to DVD is good or bad.  What I do have is a good sense of what I like, and of what made me laugh or cry, love or hate, or be interested or bored.This movie made me laugh, and a few of the scenes have rattled around in the back of my head for a long time, causing me to laugh whenever they decide to come forward.After identifying the leads, I will give a very brief synopsis of the plot, then on to some highlights, as I remember them:George Banks, played by Steve Martin, is the title character.  Nina Banks, George's wife, is portrayed by Diane Keaton.  Their daughter, the bride to be, Annie Banks, is played by Kimberly Williams.  And, if a comedy can be said to have its own comedy relief, that is provided by Martin Short as Franck Eggelhoffer, Wedding Consultant.Plot:  Annie comes home from 6 months abroad and tells her parents that she is engaged to be married.  George is not too happy about this, as he is not ready for his daughter to leave home.  He is finally convinced to give in to the inevitable, and the wedding planning begins.  The plot line follows through the wedding preparations and the wedding, itself.  Like most light comedies I've seen, the plot merely provides a setting for the comedy to follow.As in a few of my other reviews, I'm doing this from memory, so I may occasionally be &quot;off&quot; in the details.  Forgive me my errors or omissions.One of my impressions from early in the movie is how thrilled George is when told that the wedding will be at home.  He has visions of a backyard get-together where he fires up the old barbecue and cooks burgers for everyone.  Boy, is he in for a surprise.Enter Franck Eggelhoffer, the wedding planner your mother warned you about.  Each time he opens his mouth, and Nina and Annie nod their heads in agreement, George rightfully visualizes another few thousand dollars flying out the window:  An enlarged back yard, a tent for a few hundred guests, thousands of dollars worth of wiring, live swans, ice sculptures, caterers, musicians, you name it.  Nothing, and I mean nothing, is too much.Franck has an unidentifiable accent that cracked me up every time he opened his mouth.All of this proves too much for George and he goes bezerk.  At his most fragile, he goes to a supermarket to buy some hotdogs and buns for an at home barbecue one evening in the middle of the planning period.  One step from a straight jacket anyway, he cannot cope with the fact that there are  different quantities of hot dogs and buns in their respective packages.  He rants and raves and begins to tear the package of buns to shreds.  Finally, the police are called and he, the respected middle-class professional from San Marino, CA, is arrested.

The guests are greeted by flooding caused by melting ice sculptures, swans running wild, and other colossal mishaps.

His daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) has just announced that she's getting married to Bryan (George Newbern), a man she met while studying in Europe.  While George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is thrilled by the news, George doesn't handle it well.  After all, this means big changes happening in his life.  And he doesn't cope well with change.So, naturally, he handles this the way any dad would.  He starts watching ""America's Most Wanted"" in case Bryan is on it.  And when it comes to planning the wedding, his idea is cheap and informal, much to the women's dismay.  Will he ever get with the program?  And if he does, will he survive the big day?This movie isn't a laugh until it hurts comedy.  There are plenty of laugh out loud parts, but the humor is often subtler.  While some of George's antics are definitely over the top and border on embarrassing, the movie manages to find the balance between embarrassment and humor.  And the ending it truly touching.And I can't say enough about the acting.  Everyone is believable.  In fact, what makes the movie work is the fact that every one of the characters and actors seems absolutely real.  The exception, of course, are Franck and Howard, the over the top wedding coordinators played by Martin Short and B. D.

310735,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6302409829,Nix Pix,"[2, 3]","""Father of The Bride"" is one of those rare instances in filmdom where I think the remake has actually improved on the original. Director Vincente Minnelli's ""Father of the Bride"" starred Spencer Tracy as harried George Banks and the stunning Elizabeth Taylor as his daughter, Kaye. And although I have a great affinity for both these performers, in retrospect neither seems to be served well by the dated and stagy source material.  Forget the 50s sexual politics which, for its time, must have seemed cutting edge. It's the Salvidor Dali-esque dream sequence that continues to haunt me.How wonderful then to experience Steve Martin's tender take on George and Kimberly Williams (now renamed Annie) as his effervescently head-strong daughter. The story - that of a harried and overly protective father suddenly faced with the reality that his little girl is getting married - is nearly identical to the original, and yet it's strangely and wonderfully fresh and different. Martin Short makes a welcomed edition to the cast as Annie's flamboyant wedding coordinator Frank Engelhoff (played straight in the original by Leo Genn). George Newbern costars as the groom (Bryan McKenzie now, Buckley Dunston in the original). Dianne Keaton, B.D. Wong and Kate McGregor-Stewart are all welcomed additions of inspired casting. There is a sense of enduring poignancy to this film that I found completely lacking in the original.The DVD transfer from Touchstone/Disney is in a word, unacceptable. It's widescreen - yest, but not anamorphic. Contrast levels are way too low. And although there are no digital anomalies to speak of (aliasing, shimmering, edge enhancement, et al) color balancing is incredibly weak. Interior scenes are either excessively pink or very orange while exterior night scenes tend to be awash in an undistinguished mesh of midnight blues. Fine detail is never fully realized. There's a decided hazy quality to the entire film that makes it look much older than it actually is. Several scenes are very blurry while overall the picture is only moderately sharp at best. The soundtrack is Dolby 2-channel and adequate, I suppose - - but just barely. There are no extra features.

A befuddled father is trying to deal with his daughter's engagement and marriage.  What a storm in the midst of the Bank's home!  George Banks, the father, is shocked with Annie's anouncement over dinner, she is going the marry a complete stranger that she met in Rome.  The poor father is really loving and caring of his only daughter, and he wants only what is best for her.  His sensiable wife, Nina, tries to make him understand just what a big deal the wedding really is.  George gradually gives in, ready to help prepare for his daughter's dream wedding and rception.  However, the off-the-wall caterer and his crazy ideas, the expense, and the rush and hurry of life in general is enough the drive him up a wall.  This movie indeed has a happy, fairy-tale ending.

310741,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,6302409829,Silver Screen,"[3, 4]","Whereas many remakes of beloved films stumble and fall, this ""Father of the Bride"" shines in its own right.The wonderful Steve Martin steps into Spencer Tracy's shoes (no enviable task)as the harried and worried father of the bride, George Banks.Diane Keaton is lovely as Nina, George's wife and mother of the bride.  She provides the grounding voice of reason to George's hysteria, much as Joan Bennett's Ellie did in the original.Kimberly Williams is simply a breath of fresh air as Annie, the bride (taking the place of Elizabeth Taylor's Kay). Her enthusiasm, excitement and joy over her upcoming nuptials simply jump off the screen.George Newbern as Bryan, the prospective groom, is solid and he proves to be as stable to Annie's excitement as Nina is to George.Martin Short as Frank the wedding coordinator is priceless.  His theatrics and mannerisms alone make this movie worth watching.Kieran Culkin is appropriately cute as Annie's younger brother Matt.The best parts of this movie?  The sheer comedy. Martin's Banks is far more comedic than the more stoic Banks as played by Tracy - - Martin doesn't even need to speak, his expressions are priceless by themselves.  Martin and Keaton also share a witty and comfortable banter that was not expressed in the original (where Tracy and Bennett slept in separate twin beds, as was the custom back in the 50s)  The genuine love and affection between Annie and Bryan is also more evident in the remake, versus the almost too-proper courtship of Kay and Buckley in the original, where Kay announces she is marrying as if she is announcing an upcoming test or rainstorm.That aside, though, the Tracy version seems somehow more solid and honestly touching than the remake. Without the comedy masking the true feelings, we can feel the honest pain and sadness that Tracy's Banks feels at losing his only daughter.Additionally, the money angle plays a larger part in the remake.  We understand that Martin's Banks owns his own company (a sports shoe manufacturer) but $250 per head? And a pricey wedding planner/coordinator?  Whereas the original film dealt with Banks' fear and confusion over the financial aspects of the upcoming wedding, the remake really hits home how costly everything is - - if you want to travel first class, that is.Overall, the message is the same as in the original.  Father loves his daughter, who he only wants to be happy, even if it means relinquishing her to another man.",4,Better than usual remake,1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,2451,"['Whereas', 'many', 'remakes', 'beloved', 'films', 'stumble', 'fall', 'Father', 'Bride', 'shines', 'own', 'right.The', 'wonderful', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'shoes', 'enviable', 'task', 'harried', 'worried', 'father', 'bride', 'George', 'Banks.Diane', 'Keaton', 'lovely', 'Nina', 'George', 'wife', 'mother', 'bride', 'grounding', 'voice', 'reason', 'George', 'hysteria', 'much', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'Ellie', 'did', 'original.Kimberly', 'Williams', 'simply', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Annie', 'bride', 'taking', 'place', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Kay', 'enthusiasm', 'excitement', 'joy', 'upcoming', 'nuptials', 'simply', 'jump', 'off', 'screen.George', 'Newbern', 'Bryan', 'prospective', 'groom', 'solid', 'be', 'as', 'stable', 'Annie', 'excitement', 'Nina', 'George.Martin', 'Short', 'Frank', 'wedding', 'coordinator', 'priceless', 'theatrics', 'mannerisms', 'alone', 'make', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching.Kieran', 'Culkin', 'appropriately', 'cute', 'Annie', 'younger', 'brother', 'Matt.The', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'sheer', 'comedy', 'Martin', 'Banks', 'far', 'more', 'comedic', 'more', 'stoic', 'Banks', 'played', 'Tracy', 'Martin', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'speak', 'expressions', 'are', 'priceless', 'Martin', 'Keaton', 'also', 'share', 'witty', 'comfortable', 'banter', 'was', 'not', 'expressed', 'original', 'where', 'Tracy', 'Bennett', 'slept', 'separate', 'twin', 'beds', 'was', 'custom', 'back', '50s', 'genuine', 'love', 'affection', 'Annie', 'Bryan', 'also', 'more', 'evident', 'remake', 'almost', 'too-proper', 'courtship', 'Kay', 'Buckley', 'original', 'where', 'Kay', 'marrying', 'announcing', 'upcoming', 'test', 'rainstorm.That', 'aside', 'Tracy', 'version', 'somehow', 'more', 'solid', 'honestly', 'touching', 'remake', 'comedy', 'masking', 'true', 'feelings', 'can', 'feel', 'honest', 'pain', 'sadness', 'Tracy', 'Banks', 'feels', 'losing', 'only', 'daughter.Additionally', 'money', 'angle', 'larger', 'part', 'remake', 'understand', 'Martin', 'Banks', 'own', 'company', 'sports', 'shoe', 'manufacturer', '250', 'head', 'pricey', 'wedding', 'planner/coordinator', 'original', 'film', 'dealt', 'Banks', 'fear', 'confusion', 'financial', 'aspects', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'remake', 'really', 'home', 'how', 'costly', 'everything', 'want', 'travel', 'first', 'class', 'is.Overall', 'message', 'same', 'original', 'Father', 'daughter', 'who', 'only', 'be', 'happy', 'even', 'relinquishing', 'man']",Father of the Bride VHS

The original film directed by Vincente Minnelli had charm and a number of fabulous sequences in it but Charles Shyer's film nicely updates the original film with some gut busting laughs for the ironic age. Shyer's films have a number of nice touches and references to other films including Martin commenting (as Banks) that he doesn't want to be bankrupt by the wedding and have to wander the streets in a bathrobe (a reference to Carl Reiner's film ""The Jerk"" starring Martin): Bank's character is named after George Banks (David Tomlinson) from the Disney classic ""Mary Poppins""; the Bank's character's middle name of Stanley is borrowed from the father in the Spencer Tracey original and loads of other references to classic Hollywood films. This is the third turn for ""Father of the Bride"" (it was also a short lived TV series in 1960) and it's still delightful although this 15th Anniversary Edition is a year premature (the film came out in 1991).George Banks' (Steve Martin) little girl Annie (Kimberly Williams) is getting married. All of the mayhem that you can imagine in a Steve Martin PG comedy ensues. Kimberly is marrying her college sweetheart Bryan (George Newbern). Banks doesn't have a problem with the concept of his daughter getting married but he does have an issue with his little growing up because, well, it means he's getting old, too. With delightful comic turns by Martin Short (as the wedding coordinator) and Diane Keaton, ""Father of the Bride"" unlike most remakes manages to update the material and make it work for a modern audience without betraying the emotional core that drove the comedy in the original film.This version of ""Bride"" gets the deluxe treatment  i the 15th Anniversary Edition. I don't know honestly if all of these featurettes and the commentary track were on the 2003 edition. I'd suspect they were and this is just a re-release in new packaging. The previous edition released two years ago was a nice anamorphic transfer.  The sharp image quality and remarkable clarity evident here is a slight improvement over the original DVD release (although the previous version looked pretty darn good, too). It appears that the same transfer was used for this version and the film was tweaked a bit for the latest release. The 5.1 soundtrackI seem to recall the extras here being the same as on the previous edition but that could just be faulty memory on my part. Either way, ""Martin & Short Interview Each Other"" is an amusing 5 minute, bizarre tongue-in-cheek featurette where they skewer each other, the roles they play and everything else in sight. At one point Short talks about how playing a woman liberated him in this film. He plays a man. We also get an 11 minute standard ""Making of"" featurette on the film with some amusing behind-the-scenes takes on the film.Director Charles Shyer's commentary track is both informative and funny. Shyer discusses the challenges of directing a remake of a classic film. He notes that it's a fine line bringing a contemporary tone to the film but not playing with it or improving it into ""a failure"". It's particularly interesting to note that Shyer and Meyers both have a high regard for the original film. Hence, the things that worked well in the original (such as the opening monologue) are just updated (and, according to Shyer it took 35 takes to shoot the opening because of a number of technical issues that kept occurring). It's a pity we don't have Martin's comments or, for that matter, other cast members since Shyer recorded the commentary track 13 years after the film's original release (and he hadn't seen it since he finished working on it in 1991).You're invited to a very funny wedding featuring funny men Steve Martin and Martin Short with able support from funny woman Diane Keaton. A delightful update of the 1950's classic, ""Father of the Bride"" has a number of moments that ring true for me from my experience with my sister. If you have the previous edition of the movie I don't know that I can recommend upgrading but if you haven't purchased until now, Buena Vista Home Video has priced this to move.",4,A very funny wedding featuring Steve Martin and Martin Short,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,4225,"['suppose', 'never', 'saw', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'replacing', 'Spencer', 'Tracey', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'replacing', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'original', 'film', 'directed', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'had', 'charm', 'number', 'fabulous', 'sequences', 'Charles', 'Shyer', 'film', 'nicely', 'original', 'film', 'gut', 'busting', 'laughs', 'ironic', 'age', 'Shyer', 'films', 'have', 'number', 'nice', 'touches', 'references', 'other', 'films', 'including', 'Martin', 'commenting', 'Banks', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'bankrupt', 'wedding', 'have', 'wander', 'streets', 'bathrobe', 'reference', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'film', 'Jerk', 'starring', 'Martin', 'Bank', 'character', 'named', 'George', 'Banks', 'David', 'Tomlinson', 'Disney', 'classic', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Bank', 'character', 'middle', 'name', 'Stanley', 'borrowed', 'father', 'Spencer', 'Tracey', 'original', 'loads', 'other', 'references', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'third', 'turn', 'Father', 'Bride', 'was', 'also', 'short', 'lived', 'TV', 'series', '1960', 'still', 'delightful', '15th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'year', 'premature', 'film', 'came', 'out', '1991', '.George', 'Banks', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'little', 'girl', 'Annie', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'getting', 'married', 'mayhem', 'can', 'imagine', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'PG', 'comedy', 'ensues', 'Kimberly', 'marrying', 'college', 'sweetheart', 'Bryan', 'George', 'Newbern', 'Banks', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'concept', 'daughter', 'getting', 'married', 'have', 'issue', 'little', 'growing', 'up', 'because', 'well', 'getting', 'old', 'too', 'delightful', 'comic', 'turns', 'Martin', 'Short', 'wedding', 'coordinator', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Father', 'Bride', 'most', 'remakes', 'manages', 'update', 'material', 'make', 'work', 'modern', 'audience', 'betraying', 'emotional', 'core', 'drove', 'comedy', 'original', 'film.This', 'version', 'Bride', 'deluxe', 'treatment', '15th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'honestly', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'track', 'were', '2003', 'edition', ""'d"", 'suspect', 'were', 'just', 're-release', 'new', 'packaging', 'previous', 'edition', 'released', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'nice', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'sharp', 'image', 'quality', 'remarkable', 'clarity', 'evident', 'here', 'slight', 'improvement', 'original', 'DVD', 'release', 'previous', 'version', 'looked', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'too', 'same', 'transfer', 'was', 'used', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'tweaked', 'bit', 'latest', 'release', '5.1', 'soundtrackI', 'seem', 'recall', 'extras', 'here', 'being', 'same', 'previous', 'edition', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'faulty', 'memory', 'part', 'way', 'Martin', 'Short', 'Interview', 'Other', 'amusing', '5', 'minute', 'bizarre', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'featurette', 'where', 'skewer', 'other', 'roles', 'play', 'everything', 'else', 'sight', 'one', 'point', 'Short', 'talks', 'how', 'playing', 'woman', 'liberated', 'film', 'man', 'also', 'get', '11', 'minute', 'standard', 'Making', 'featurette', 'film', 'amusing', 'behind-the-scenes', 'film.Director', 'Charles', 'Shyer', 'commentary', 'track', 'informative', 'funny', 'Shyer', 'challenges', 'directing', 'remake', 'classic', 'film', 'fine', 'line', 'bringing', 'contemporary', 'tone', 'film', 'not', 'playing', 'improving', 'failure', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'note', 'Shyer', 'Meyers', 'have', 'high', 'regard', 'original', 'film', 'Hence', 'things', 'worked', 'well', 'original', 'such', 'opening', 'monologue', 'are', 'just', 'updated', 'according', 'Shyer', 'took', '35', 'shoot', 'opening', 'number', 'technical', 'issues', 'kept', 'occurring', 'pity', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Martin', 'comments', 'matter', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'Shyer', 'recorded', 'commentary', 'track', '13', 'years', 'film', 'original', 'release', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'finished', 'working', '1991', '.You', ""'re"", 'invited', 'very', 'funny', 'wedding', 'featuring', 'funny', 'men', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Martin', 'Short', 'able', 'support', 'funny', 'woman', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'delightful', 'update', '1950', 'classic', 'Father', 'Bride', 'number', 'moments', 'ring', 'true', 'experience', 'sister', 'have', 'previous', 'edition', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'recommend', 'upgrading', 'have', ""n't"", 'purchased', 'now', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'Home', 'Video', 'priced', 'move']",Father of the Bride VHS

Children want to see Hannah Montana, teens want Harry Potter and superheroes, while adults want very R-rated drama.  Thus, it is refreshing to see a movie that can be classified as a solid family film, which Father of the Bride very much is.While comedic in nature (how could it not be starring Steve Martin?!), this film is also a touching commentary on how families change (for better or worse) when marriages occur.  Its blend of hilarious comedy and touching emotions will have you holding your sides one minute and reaching for the Kleenex box the next.The real brilliance of this film, however, comes from the terrific acting.  Martin's knack for physical comedy is spot-on as the often-flummoxed ""Dear Old Dad"", while Diane Keaton plays a great ""straight 'man'"" to Martin's wild antics.  Even the then-fresh Kimberly Williams (before she became Mrs. Brad Paisley) is able to nail the emotions of a young bride being swept off her feet.Overall, this is a great family film that offers something for everyone.  Adults will be touched by the film's message, teens will identify with Williams' character, and even younger children will appreciate the physical comedy.  If you are planning a wedding, just finished one, or are part of any sort of family structure whatsoever, you will love this film!",5,A Great Family Film,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,1392,"['today', 'Hollywood', 'climate', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'appeal', 'entire', 'family', 'Children', 'want', 'see', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'want', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'superheroes', 'adults', 'want', 'very', 'R-rated', 'drama', 'Thus', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'classified', 'solid', 'family', 'film', 'Father', 'Bride', 'very', 'much', 'is.While', 'comedic', 'nature', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'starring', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'film', 'also', 'touching', 'commentary', 'how', 'families', 'change', 'better', 'worse', 'when', 'marriages', 'occur', 'blend', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'touching', 'emotions', 'will', 'have', 'holding', 'sides', 'one', 'minute', 'reaching', 'Kleenex', 'next.The', 'real', 'brilliance', 'film', 'however', 'terrific', 'acting', 'Martin', 'knack', 'physical', 'comedy', 'spot-on', 'often-flummoxed', 'Dear', 'Old', 'Dad', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'great', 'straight', ""'man"", 'Martin', 'wild', 'antics', 'Even', 'then-fresh', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'became', 'Mrs.', 'Brad', 'Paisley', 'able', 'nail', 'emotions', 'young', 'bride', 'being', 'swept', 'off', 'feet.Overall', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'something', 'everyone', 'Adults', 'will', 'be', 'touched', 'film', 'message', 'teens', 'will', 'identify', 'Williams', 'character', 'even', 'younger', 'children', 'will', 'appreciate', 'physical', 'comedy', 'are', 'planning', 'wedding', 'just', 'finished', 'one', 'are', 'part', 'sort', 'family', 'structure', 'whatsoever', 'will', 'love', 'film']",Father of the Bride VHS
