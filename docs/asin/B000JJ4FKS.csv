My wife and I wanted very much to like it --the title sounded right down our dog-lover alley. And we kept waiting for it to pull the plot together. We both fell off our chairs at the ending. See for yourself.But our Greenland Husky Avu loved it --well most of it. She usually sleeps or chews on a bone while we watch a film, but with this movie she gazed intently at the screen, especially during the first dog scenes. Her head went from side to side and the dogs demonstrated their agility training. But toward the end, she too had had enough --she wandered downstairs to her food and water.Better luck next time.

1026699,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000JJ4FKS,Artist & Author,"[1, 1]","It is unusual to see a kid's movie with no children in the movie, but this is one such movie.  At least, either it is intended for children or for extremely juvenile adults who like talking dogs!  It also uses just about every subplot used in children's movies, except for orphans.  I guess the dogs take the place of orphans.  That said, it does try to give lots of good little lessons in ethics or morality, or just sage advice for life that children should learn.  I gave it an average rating because I thought the ending was quite corny.  This is one movie kids can mostly safely watch (there are a few swear words used), and I think most kids would like it; however, it is not worth seeking out to see it.  If you find it in the Wal-Mart movie 'dump bin' or for rent, if you want something kids can watch, get it and let them see it.  Parents can point out the many 'lessons of life' as they notice them in the movie.",3,Unusual Kids Movie with no Children in the Story,1177977600,"05 1, 2007",2007,922,"['unusual', 'see', 'kid', 'movie', 'children', 'movie', 'one', 'such', 'movie', 'least', 'intended', 'children', 'extremely', 'juvenile', 'adults', 'who', 'talking', 'dogs', 'also', 'just', 'about', 'subplot', 'used', 'children', 'movies', 'orphans', 'guess', 'dogs', 'take', 'place', 'orphans', 'said', 'try', 'give', 'lots', 'good', 'little', 'lessons', 'ethics', 'morality', 'just', 'sage', 'advice', 'life', 'children', 'should', 'learn', 'gave', 'average', 'rating', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'quite', 'corny', 'one', 'movie', 'kids', 'can', 'mostly', 'safely', 'watch', 'are', 'few', 'swear', 'words', 'used', 'think', 'most', 'kids', 'would', 'like', 'however', 'not', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', 'see', 'find', 'Wal-Mart', 'movie', 'bin', 'rent', 'want', 'something', 'kids', 'can', 'watch', 'get', 'let', 'see', 'Parents', 'can', 'point', 'out', 'many', ""'lessons"", 'life', 'notice', 'movie']",N/A

One, film students should watch it to learn how not to direct, how not to act, how not to write, etc.  The second purpose would be to extract confessions from enemy combatants. Anyone forced to watch this lame movie more than once would confess to anything. I love dogs and was trying to find a movie that my mother-in-law would enjoy as well.

The reviews of this movie were even more entertaining than the movie!! My kids and I read them together and agreed with every one of them. The hospital scene has got to be the worst dying scene EVER.

The core of the story started great with a young man turned from bad to good through the help of good people. They should have kept it that way. How they ended the story was ridiculous. STOP READING if you don't want to know the ending.CGI groom?? and CGI groom turned real for a brief moment? There are just too many silly/unrealistic parts that made this movie horrible. The movie should have ended when the dog graduation was over. Wedding part was unnecessary. The only redeeming quality is the acting from the leading actress and Maxwell Caufield. The leading actress reminded me of Charlize Theron and Jessica Alba. It's good to see Maxwell back. 1 Star for story. 2 stars for good acting from these 2 actors.,2,Ridiculous Story but some redeeming qualities,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,752,"['Story', 'great', 'ridiculous', 'core', 'story', 'started', 'great', 'young', 'man', 'turned', 'bad', 'good', 'help', 'good', 'people', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'way', 'How', 'ended', 'story', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'STOP', 'READING', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'ending.CGI', 'groom', 'CGI', 'groom', 'turned', 'real', 'brief', 'moment', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'silly/unrealistic', 'parts', 'made', 'movie', 'horrible', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'when', 'dog', 'graduation', 'was', 'over', 'Wedding', 'part', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'acting', 'leading', 'actress', 'Maxwell', 'Caufield', 'leading', 'actress', 'reminded', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'good', 'see', 'Maxwell', 'back', '1', 'Star', 'story', '2', 'stars', 'good', 'acting', '2', 'actors']",N/A
