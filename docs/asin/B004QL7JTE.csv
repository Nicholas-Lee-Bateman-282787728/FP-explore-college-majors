I thought they did a fantastic job.  I felt the years melt away and I was transported back 25 years.  That was worth the price of the movie alone.  As for the story, I was a little disappointed.  It is a good story that could have been a little better.  The movie was an emotional roller-coaster and at times I felt emotional manipulations were just too obvious.

Sometimes in a difficult time, or the loss of a loved one, I've found that taking a walk with our Alaska Husky Avu, and singing ""Born to Be Wild"" or ""Truckin"" or other anthem from that period, helps. Even during the 2008 financial meltdown,the music was there---So here is an Indy Movie (only one copy on the Video store shelf) which makes that music a very special part of a troubled family  --where son ran off and now has a brain tumor and very limited memory.The 60s type music comes into the family story, when a miracle is needed to help the son. We (and he) hear the Grateful Dead,Cream, the Beatles, and many more.Even five seconds of one of my favorite groups ""Steppenwolf.""You'll see how the music hits some centers of the son's brain ---how much and how enduring ----you'll see, and hear it all! The music, as strong as it is, does not eclipse the story of the family. That's what makes this movie extra special.Some say the key relationship is between the son and his father.

Gabriel Sawyer (Pucci) left home around the age of 17 in 1970 or 71 (we never know exactly, but I determined that range based on the music (specifically the use of the CSN song ""Ohio"") after arguing with his father about how he protested the Vietnam war during a musical performance.The movie begins when Gabriel turns up in late 1985 with a brain tumor and no memories from the last 12 or 13 years (only a few years after he left home). Gabriel can't make any new memories, and his parents joy at his return is juxtaposed with the frustration (and regret) about what happened when he was 17 (and that they can't really have a deep discussion with him). A music therapist (played by Julie Ormond, who has aged considerably since ""Legends of the Fall"" but is still lovely) helps Gabriel heal through music. He responds exceptionally well to the music of the late 60's, especially the Beatles, Dylan and most significantly, the Grateful Dead.The pace is slow at times, and it is a bit emotionally heavy handed.

1424211,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004QL7JTE,Grady Harp,"[39, 39]","Oliver Sacks, M.D. is a physician and professor of neurology and psychiatry at the Columbia University Medical Center. In 2007, he was named the first Columbia University Artist, in recognition of his contributions to the arts. THE MUSIC NEVER STOPPED is an adaptation (by Gwyn Lurie and Gary Marks) of  ""The Last Hippie"", a short story/essay from  Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"", a collection of case history stories. Dr. Sacks is a neurologist who has  spent his career diagnosing, evaluating, and treating a variety of neurological disorders (and the oftentimes the profound personality shifts that resulted in brain injury or trauma). This information provides a bit of reality ground to the film and makes it all the more important to see and respect.  As directed by Jim Kohlberg, this film is a quiet, reverent, at times  disturbing exploration of the many aspects of brain function and malfunction and an example of adaptation to these challenges.Gabriel Sawyer (Lou Taylor Pucci) was a bright youngster in the 1070s when the Vietnam war was altering the nation's perception of right and wrong as expressed in the music of Bob Dylan, the Grateful Dead, Cream, the Beatles, etc.  Longing to be a professional musician he foregoes his parent's wishes that he attend college and with regret leaves his girlfriend Tamara (Tammy Blanchard) and takes off for New York's Greenwich Village. Fast forward to 1986 and Gabriel is hospitalized for an enormous brain tumor, surgically removed, but leaving Gabriel without the ability to remember.  At this point Gabriel's parents are located and his father Henry (J.K. Simmons) and mother Helen (Cara Seymour) visit him in the hospital, longing to reconnect with the son that has been absent for fifteen years.  The lack of memory emphasizes the schism between Henry and Gabriel and Henry's depressed state results in his being  placed on sick leave from his successful job to deal with the trauma of his family.  Music having been so important to Gabriel as  young man introduces the music therapist Dianne Daley (Julia Ormond) who meticulously follows the cues form Gabriel's attention span and is able to open the doorway to his memory loss through his love of the music of his time.  Henry latches on to this and decides the only way he will be able to rebuild the broken fence of his relationship to Gabriel will be through music and together the two find connection despite the neurological blockades.The cast is exemplary: J.K. Simmons is splendid as the father, Cara Seymour makes the mother wholly credible, Julia Ormond gives a selfless, fine performance, and Lou Taylor Pucci brings life to the long injured Gabriel.  The music is by the recordings of the period with special music supplied by Paul Cantelon.  Stephen Kazmierski's camera work allows almost unbearably touching close-ups of each of the actors that open the story for us.  This is a film based on a true case history, but this is also a story that is immensely touching and uplifting simply from the way it has been written, directed and acted.

1424217,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B004QL7JTE,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[0, 0]","This film is based on an article by Oliver Sacks, whose writings also inspired the 1990 tear-jerker Awakenings. Like that film, this one hides an essentially optimistic tale of human redemption behind a superficially maudlin, slow-moving veneer. There&#8217;s a fine line between &#8220;affecting&#8221; and &#8220;manipulative&#8221; in filmmaking, and which side of that line you see this movie on, depends on what you bring to the experience.JK Simmons (&#8220;Law & Order,&#8221; &#8220;Spider-Man) plays Henry Sawyer, a burned out engineer whose life apparently stopped in the Eisenhower years. His estranged ex-hippie son Gabriel (relative unknown Lou Taylor Pucci) reappears after twenty years, but a brain tumor has erased all memories formed after 1970. Music therapist Dianne Daley (Julia Ormond) reawakens Gabriel&#8217;s higher functions using classic rock on vinyl, particularly the Grateful Dead, much to Gabriel&#8217;s reactionary father&#8217;s chagrin.Simmons almost never plays lead roles, and it&#8217;s unusual for actors of his age to carry feature-length films, so we&#8217;re moving outside Hollywood&#8217;s comfort zone on two levels. Kudos for that. As Sawyer, Simmons plays a man who has stopped keeping up with society. His household decor is antiquated, even for the 1986 setting, and he refuses to learn computer-assisted drafting and other trade tools. Sawyer simply rejects all modernity.Gabriel is supposedly around 35, but looks 18 under layers of beard. He thinks it&#8217;s only two years since he fled his father&#8217;s constricting suburban world for Greenwich Village bohemianism. Because his tumor also destroyed his inhibitions, his classic rock also lets him tell his father all the secrets he previously bottled up, but because he creates only fleeting, isolated new memories, he never gains closure, persistently revisiting old pains.Because Gabriel cannot change or grow, Henry must adapt to Gabriel&#8217;s illness. A jazz purist, Henry must learn to appreciate classic rock, rebuilding himself as America&#8217;s oldest Deadhead. Even as his own health slowly fails, he becomes broadly hip, awakening himself to new experiences and previously untapped reserves of enthusiasm. Henry, in second youth, and Gabriel, trapped in permanent adolescence, finally make the connection they couldn&#8217;t in 1966.It&#8217;s tempting to fling feminist aspersions on this film. M&iacute;a Maestro and Tammy Blanchard as Gabriel&#8217;s love interests, Cara Seymour as Henry&#8217;s wife and Gabriel&#8217;s mother, and Julia Ormond as Dr. Daley, all play second fiddle to these two men. But I quickly realized: so do all the other men. This is emphatically not an ensemble piece. All characters and relationships are subordinate to the father-son dynamic herein.We could continue. The film situates the Sawyers, including hospitalized Gabriel, in the same suburban, preponderantly white, bourgeois environment Gabriel so ostentatiously fled. Except for one pretty Hispanic orderly, nobody confronts poor or non-white characters. And note, the only significant character of color is explicitly romanticized. Why doesn&#8217;t hippie Gabriel rebel afresh? Perhaps because, beneath its egalitarian baggage, hippie bohemianism was an innately white middle-class conceit anyway.This film&#8217;s small-budget, art house texture eschews glamor and spectacle, but this opens other possibilities. Because director Jim Kohlberg maintains his understated tone without bogging down, he permits opportunities for quiet humor and character development. It&#8217;s so quiet, in fact, that Hollywood-raised film children may get lost. Henry&#8217;s tear-filled climactic monologue will probably strike film audiences as sentimental, but book readers will appreciate its relative restraint and lack of bombast.Kohlberg probably spent more on soundtrack rights than his thrift-shop set design, lending the film a shopworn look but a rich, surprisingly nuanced soundscape. For instance, Peggy Lee&#8217;s version of &#8220;Till There Was You&#8221; looms large in the movie&#8217;s themes; but in one key scene, stodgy Henry replaces it with the Beatles&#8217; rendition. This willingness to leap forward seven years is remarkable for the character, without requiring aggressive directorial jazz hands.Browsing professional reviews, I&#8217;ve seen two basic threads: critics who hate this film because it doesn&#8217;t resemble typical Hollywood fare, and critics who embrace it for the same reason. Mass media insidership makes a difference. Audiences accustomed to, and comfortable with, Hollywood culture will find this movie contrived and lethargic. Audiences who haven&#8217;t internalized the lingo will enjoy the relaxed pace and subtle, cerebral themes.Fundamentally, this film is about the romanticized past. Set in 1986, it pits Henry, trapped in 1950, against Gabriel, trapped in 1968. But in era-hopping, it reminds us, the past isn&#8217;t frozen. As Dr. Daley notes, we constantly rewrite history in light of our present circumstances. What past, this film asks, would we agree to lock ourselves into? And when would we set ourselves free?",4,The Past Is Prologue,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,5173,"['film', 'based', 'article', 'Oliver', 'Sacks', 'writings', 'also', 'inspired', '1990', 'tear-jerker',

1424220,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B004QL7JTE,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 2]","The Music Never Stopped is a poignant film based on the true case of a man who suffered from a rather noticeable memory loss. The plot moves along at a good pace and I wasn't ever bored--indeed, the acting especially by J.K. Simmons and Lou Taylor Pucci was so convincing that the movie held my complete attention every step of the way. The choreography and cinematography enhance the picture while the musical score is amazing with classic tunes that will appeal to older and younger music fans alike. There's practically something for everyone in that musical score!The action begins in 1986 when Henry and Helen Sawyer (J.K. Simmons and Cara Seymore) get a phone call from a local hospital that their long lost son Gabriel (Lou Taylor Pucci) is there--but Gabriel has a large, albeit benign, brain tumor that damaged to his ability to remember things, especially things after 1970. The doctors operate and for a while Gabriel appears to be mostly unresponsive and in his own world. Until, that is, Gabriel finally listens to some music that he loves--and brings back certain memories for him.Of course, things get even more complicated. Henry is laid off from his job--and Helen goes out and gets work but where she finds work may surprise you! Moreover, as Henry must now pay more attention to his son, he discovers that he misses his son more than he really knew; Henry wants to find a way to communicate with his son once again. Henry tries to reconnect with Gabriel using the music that Gabe loves; and the film includes some flashbacks so the audience can understand why Henry and Gabriel couldn't get along and why Gabriel decided to leave home so many years ago. Whether or not Henry successfully reconnects with Gabriel, and how Gabriel's mother fits into the picture, remains the focus of the plot and leads into the ending of the story.The DVD comes with extras including interview footage with Oliver Sacks, M.D., who wrote the essay about the man who suffered that terrible brain tumor and damage; we get deleted scenes and more as well.Look also for excellent performances by Tammy Blanchard as Gabe's old girlfriend Tamara; M&iacute;a Maestro as Celia who works in the kitchen of the facility where Gabriel lives; Scott Adsit as Dr. Biscow and Max Antisell as a young Gabriel. Julia Ormond turns in a terrific performance as Dianne Daley, a music therapist trying to help Gabriel recover as many of his memories as possible.The Music Never Stopped is an excellent film because of the acting, its moving story and that wonderful music. As others have noted, people who feel distanced from their children (or parents) would do well to get this film, watch it and think about its message. People who enjoy sensitive dramas based on real life will also appreciate this movie and its awesome musical score.",5,well done !!!,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,2818,"['Music', 'Never', 'Stopped', 'poignant', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'case', 'man', 'who', 'suffered', 'rather', 'noticeable', 'memory', 'loss', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'was', ""n't"", 'ever', 'bored', 'indeed', 'acting', 'especially', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Lou', 'Taylor', 'Pucci', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'movie', 'held', 'complete', 'attention', 'step', 'way', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'enhance', 'picture', 'musical', 'score', 'amazing', 'classic', 'tunes', 'will', 'appeal', 'older', 'younger', 'music', 'fans', 'alike', 'practically', 'something', 'everyone', 'musical', 'score', 'action', '1986', 'when', 'Henry', 'Helen', 'Sawyer', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Cara', 'Seymore', 'get', 'phone', 'call', 'local', 'hospital', 'long', 'lost', 'son', 'Gabriel', 'Lou', 'Taylor', 'Pucci', 'Gabriel', 'large', 'albeit', 'benign', 'brain', 'tumor', 'damaged', 'ability', 'remember', 'things', 'especially', 'things', '1970', 'doctors', 'operate', 'while', 'Gabriel', 'be', 'mostly', 'unresponsive', 'own', 'world', 'Gabriel', 'finally', 'music', 'back', 'certain', 'memories', 'him.Of', 'course', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'Henry', 'laid', 'off', 'job', 'Helen', 'out', 'work', 'where', 'work', 'may', 'surprise', 'Moreover', 'Henry', 'must', 'now', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'son', 'son', 'more', 'really', 'knew', 'Henry', 'find', 'way', 'communicate', 'son', 'once', 'again', 'Henry', 'reconnect', 'Gabriel', 'using', 'music', 'Gabe', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'audience', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'Henry', 'Gabriel', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'why', 'Gabriel', 'decided', 'leave', 'home', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Whether', 'not', 'Henry', 'successfully', 'Gabriel', 'how', 'Gabriel', 'mother', 'picture', 'focus', 'plot', 'ending', 'story.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'including', 'interview', 'footage', 'Oliver', 'Sacks', 'M.D.', 'who', 'wrote', 'essay', 'man', 'who', 'suffered', 'terrible', 'brain', 'tumor', 'damage', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'more', 'well.Look', 'also', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Tammy', 'Blanchard', 'Gabe', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Tamara', 'M', 'iacute', 'Maestro', 'Celia', 'who', 'kitchen', 'facility', 'where', 'Gabriel', 'Scott', 'Adsit', 'Dr.', 'Biscow', 'Max', 'Antisell', 'young', 'Gabriel', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Dianne', 'Daley', 'music', 'therapist', 'trying', 'help', 'Gabriel', 'recover', 'many', 'memories', 'possible.The', 'Music', 'Never', 'Stopped', 'excellent', 'film', 'acting', 'moving', 'story', 'wonderful', 'music', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'distanced', 'children', 'parents', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'get', 'film', 'watch', 'think', 'message', 'People', 'who', 'enjoy', 'sensitive', 'dramas', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'will', 'also', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'awesome', 'musical', 'score']",The Music Never Stopped

Set in 1986, the film centers on parents whose son ran away from home 20 year earlier at the age of 17.  He shows up in a hospital with a large but benign brain tumor.  It is to be removed but as expected, Gabriel (Lou Taylor Pucci) loses his short term memory and ability to socialize.  His father (the great J. K. Simmons) and mother (Cara Seymour) engage a music therapist (Julia Ormond) to help Gabriel reconnect.  the film is based on a case study by Oliver Sacks called ""The Last Hippie.""  With the help of music Gabriel is able to recall events from the mid to late 1960's because of his life as a fledgling rock musician and social activist (anti-Vietnam).  Even though Gabriel slowly comes out of his shell, Henry (Simmons) isn't all too happy believing it was the music that destroyed their relationship.  The movie is gut wrenching at times but the father and son eventually strike a bond as Henry comes to understand the rhythm of the music and meaning of the lyrics.  The film features music by Buffalo Springfield, Bob Dylan, The Birds, The Beatles and especially The Grateful Dead who was Gabe's favorite band.  The film isn't overly syrupy but does lean on sentimentality.  If you are a fan of the music in this changing period in America the film is a lovely reflection.  If you have been estranged from a family member, this film may hurt a bit.

Is it chemical?  A part of the brain that responds to the frequencies and rhythm of certain sounds played in a progression?  Or, is it just the fact that it makes one ""feel"" something?Music, like any other form of art brings out a ""feeling"" in the one experiencing it.  Those feelings will be different for everyone and some will be permanently effected by them.  Music can do many things.  It can heal, damage, make you dance, give you a headache and even make you ""high"".  According to many music therapists, it can also help recall memories.  ""The Music Never Stopped"" explores this phenomenon beautifully and is a testament to our souls connection with our music.  Set in the 80's with flashbacks to the 60's and 70's ""The Music Never Stopped"" has some of the best music from the bands of that era.  The film runs the gamete of emotions and has some powerful performances from the actors and classic bands such as The Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan, and The Beatles.Gabriel, a 30 something man with a brain tumor is unable to form new memories.  He can remember his life growing up, playing music and following his favorite bands around the country, but he can't remember what his nurse just said to him 5 minutes ago.  Lou Tayler Pucci plays the down to earth ""hippie"" Gabriel graciously and I was very impressed with his performance.  He was subtle but beautifully represented those of us obsessed with music and it's meanings.  I felt a real connection with Gabriel and his relationship with his father Henry, played impeccably by J.K. Simmons.  They have such an interesting and ever-changing dynamic, it was a pleasure to watch it all unfold.  Henry is devastated by the diagnosis Gabriel has received and feels helpless.  That is until he see's Gabriel's eyes light up at the sound of a familiar piece of music.  He realizes that through music he can connect once again with his son and hopefully repair their broken relationship.Based on the case study ""The Last Hippie"" by Dr. Oliver Sacks, ""The Music Never Stopped"" is a wonderful story and I highly recommend it.  It pulls on the heart strings of young and old alike bringing them together with the power of great music. With a PG rating, ""The Music Never Stopped"" doesn't feel like an after school special on father and son relationships.  It's obvious that the lesson goes much deeper than that.  The film is about connecting to each other through music and taking the time to understand each other through that medium.  The father/son dynamic is the ideal setting to get this point across and there are some very dramatic scenes that may bring a tear to your eye.

It transports us to a time and place where we first fell in love with a certain song, band or a piece of the lyrics.  In this aptly titled movie, ""The Music Never Stopped"", for Gabriel Sawyer (Lou Taylor Pucci -'The Story of Luke') it never did.  Directed by Jim Kohlberg from the screenplay by Gwyn Lurie and Gary Marks which was adapted from the short essay, ""The Last Hippie"", by Oliver Sacks MD.  We see gentle and nuanced performances by each of the cast that were able to tug at even the hardest of hearts.  The joy, hardships, and life experiences are all well shown by Kohlberg along with an original soundtrack (Paul Cantelon) that easily allows us to feel what Gabriel understood at the time.  The story's music centers between about 1965 through 1970, with songs featured by; 'The Grateful Dead', 'CSNY', 'Cream', 'The Beatles' and 'Bob Dylan', just to name a few from this beautifully powerful and feeling score.Being a product of the times, the protest of the war in Vietnam, avoiding a collegiate life in favor of playing music, Gabriel is caught up in this scene and in between his parents' wishes for him.  Not being able to handle the seemingly strict way his father, Henry (J.K. Simmons), wishes he would 'shape up his life' and his mother, Helen's (Cara Seymour), compliance to his father, he runs off to Greenwich Village and not seeing his family for two decades. Then the parents get that dreaded phone call.Their son is in the hospital with a huge benign tumor in his brain that is so large from neglecting his health, that it needs to be excised.  It renders Gabriel unable to make new memories, only to think he is still living within the time period of the music he loves.  Gabriel's recall is so poor that he does not remember a conversation once it is concluded.  He must begin to work with a music therapist, Dianne Daley (Julia Ormond, in a wonderfully understated role).  With daily work, she is able to find the place within the music to get into the space where Gabriel can come out of his catatonic type state and begin to open up, become talkative and animated, connecting to the songs he loves.Based on a true story, the movie is a beautiful testament to a father who never gives up and his son whom he loves.  The ways in which they all work together on Gabe's memory recall is fascinating.  The special features offer some information from Dr. Oliver Sacks which aids in how the mind snaps onto musical memory and its importance in making new long-term memories attached to music.  It helps explain how Gabriel can uniquely relate to someone by the music he knows.  His memory holds him at this time as he hasn't progressed passed this point of his life because of the damage to his brain.  Done with love and finesse, the story shows just how important it is when a person first falls in love with the music of a certain generation.  Your memory of the time does not get erased, only reinvigorated with guidance, but with Gabriel, it is downright effervescent.",5,"""Touch Of Grey"" - The Grateful Dead",1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,3050,"['power', 'music', 'almost', 'magical', 'ability', 'time', 'place', 'where', 'first', 'fell', 'love', 'certain', 'song', 'band', 'piece', 'lyrics', 'aptly', 'titled', 'movie', 'Music', 'Never', 'Stopped', 'Gabriel', 'Sawyer', 'Lou', 'Taylor', 'Pucci', ""-'The"", 'Story', 'Luke', 'never', 'did', 'Directed', 'Jim', 'Kohlberg', 'screenplay', 'Gwyn', 'Lurie', 'Gary', 'Marks', 'was', 'adapted', 'short', 'essay', 'Last', 'Hippie', 'Oliver', 'Sacks', 'MD', 'see', 'gentle', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'cast', 'were', 'able', 'tug', 'even', 'hardest', 'hearts', 'joy', 'hardships', 'life', 'experiences', 'are', 'well', 'shown', 'Kohlberg', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'Paul', 'Cantelon', 'easily', 'feel', 'what', 'Gabriel', 'understood', 'time', 'story', 'music', 'centers', '1965', '1970', 'songs', 'featured', 'Grateful', 'Dead', ""'CSNY"", 'Beatles', 'Dylan', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'beautifully', 'powerful', 'feeling', 'score.Being', 'product', 'times', 'protest', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'avoiding', 'collegiate', 'life', 'favor', 'playing', 'music', 'Gabriel', 'caught', 'up', 'scene', 'parents', 'wishes', 'Not', 'being', 'able', 'handle', 'seemingly', 'strict', 'way', 'father', 'Henry', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'would', ""'shape"", 'up', 'life', 'mother', 'Helen', 'Cara', 'Seymour', 'compliance', 'father', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'not', 'seeing', 'family', 'two', 'decades', 'Then', 'parents', 'get', 'dreaded', 'phone', 'call.Their', 'son', 'hospital', 'huge', 'benign', 'tumor', 'brain', 'so', 'large', 'neglecting', 'health', 'be', 'excised', 'Gabriel', 'unable', 'make', 'new', 'memories', 'only', 'think', 'still', 'living', 'time', 'period', 'music', 'Gabriel', 'recall', 'so', 'poor', 'not', 'remember', 'conversation', 'concluded', 'must', 'begin', 'work', 'music', 'therapist', 'Dianne', 'Daley', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'role', 'daily', 'work', 'able', 'find', 'place', 'music', 'get', 'space', 'where', 'Gabriel', 'can', 'come', 'catatonic', 'type', 'state', 'begin', 'open', 'up', 'become', 'talkative', 'animated', 'connecting', 'songs', 'loves.Based', 'true', 'story', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'testament', 'father', 'who', 'never', 'up', 'son', 'whom', 'ways', 'work', 'together', 'Gabe', 'memory', 'recall', 'fascinating', 'special', 'features', 'offer', 'information', 'Dr.', 'Oliver', 'Sacks', 'how', 'mind', 'musical', 'memory', 'importance', 'making', 'new', 'long-term', 'memories', 'attached', 'music', 'explain', 'how', 'Gabriel', 'can', 'uniquely', 'relate', 'someone', 'music', 'memory', 'time', ""n't"", 'progressed', 'passed', 'point', 'life', 'damage', 'brain', 'Done', 'love', 'finesse', 'story', 'just', 'how', 'important', 'when', 'person', 'first', 'love', 'music', 'certain', 'generation', 'memory', 'time', 'not', 'get', 'erased', 'only', 'reinvigorated', 'guidance', 'Gabriel', 'downright', 'effervescent']",The Music Never Stopped
