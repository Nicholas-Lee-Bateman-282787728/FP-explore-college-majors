This is not an action movie; however, it is a very important study on how well-intentioned presidents lose control while wielding control. And, of course, they are then left to face the consequences of their weighty decisions while the former manipulative politicians bail for cover.This movie deals with the decisions made by Lyndon B Johnson as he listened to his advisors and tried unsuccessfully to avert greater involvement in Viet Nam. It will help you appreciate why he made the announcement that he would not accept nor seek another term as president.Many lives were ruined by the decisions and influence of the men portrayed in this movie.

731831,A27T7FAONDX6VI,B00007M55W,"Chris ""Chris906""","[1, 1]","This is a really well made film on a critical time in American history. This was the time that a lot of the greatness fostered by overcoming the Great Depression and winning World War II were squandered. Lyndon B. Johnson could have been a great President but fell short because of Vietnam and his decisions about it. What he did for Civil Rights in America in 1964-1965 was truly outstanding. This is depicted very nicely in the beginning of 'Path to War'. But then inch by inch he was drawn into the morass of Vietnam and everything that he had worked for his whole political life was pretty much destroyed.Michael Gambon brings the disappointing Lyndon Johnson back to life. Though Gambon struggled a bit with the accent I thought he was quite good. It's pretty gut-wrenching stuff to see him signing paper after paper sending condolences to families of loved ones who were killed by his decisions. Also a telling scene is when LBJ looks at a newspaper political cartoon that has LBJ looking into a mirror and seeing the reflection of Barry Goldwater with the caption-""Who is the biggest hawk now?"" Gambon is also good at LBJ's earthier side and makes his character come to life. Alec Baldwin is pretty smug as Bob McNamara and captures the character well. 'Put the troops in' he says in a statement he will one day come to regret. The numbers game that McNamara played is well depicted. Donald Sutherland is outstanding as Clark Clifford and deserved the awards he received. He captures the slipperiness of Clifford well. One minute sensibly arguing that the United States has no business in Vietnam the next minute accepting being Secretary of Defense and saying that the United States has to see the situation through. Also, watch for a cameo of Gary Sinise as George Wallace reprising his previous work for director Frankenheimer.Bruce McGill is also excellent in the role of George Ball trying to stress to the President and his cabinet how useless and wasteful the war in Vietnam would be.It is really unbelievable to think that Johnson ruined a long and outstanding career in American politics by getting sucked into the endless quagmire that was Vietnam. It is really stunning how he was unraveled so quickly and to think how America went from the Johnson landslide victory of 1964 over Goldwater to Nixon becoming President in 1968.The DVD has good picture and sound plus some really good text material on LBJ and the tragic war in Vietnam. The DVD does this HBO movie proud. This is just a really fine film on a very important part of 20th Century American history.Highly recommended!",5,Excellent film bringing to life LBJ and 'The Best and the Brightest',1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,2597,"['really', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'critical', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'was', 'time', 'lot', 'greatness', 'fostered', 'overcoming', 'Great', 'Depression', 'winning', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'were', 'squandered', 'Lyndon', 'B.', 'Johnson', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'President', 'fell', 'short', 'Vietnam', 'decisions', 'What', 'did', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'America', '1964-1965', 'was', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'depicted', 'very', 'nicely', 'beginning', ""'Path"", 'War', 'then', 'inch', 'inch', 'was', 'drawn', 'morass', 'Vietnam', 'everything', 'had', 'worked', 'whole', 'political', 'life', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'destroyed.Michael', 'Gambon', 'disappointing', 'Lyndon', 'Johnson', 'back', 'life', 'Gambon', 'struggled', 'bit', 'accent', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'pretty', 'gut-wrenching', 'stuff', 'see', 'signing', 'paper', 'paper', 'sending', 'condolences', 'families', 'loved', 'ones', 'who', 'were', 'killed', 'decisions', 'Also', 'telling', 'scene', 'when', 'LBJ', 'newspaper', 'political', 'cartoon', 'LBJ', 'looking', 'mirror', 'seeing', 'reflection', 'Barry', 'Goldwater', 'caption-', 'Who', 'biggest', 'hawk', 'now', 'Gambon', 'also', 'good', 'LBJ', 'earthier', 'side', 'character', 'come', 'life', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'pretty', 'smug', 'Bob', 'McNamara', 'character', 'well', ""'Put"", 'troops', 'statement', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'come', 'regret', 'numbers', 'game', 'McNamara', 'played', 'well', 'depicted', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'outstanding', 'Clark', 'Clifford', 'deserved', 'awards', 'received', 'slipperiness', 'Clifford', 'well', 'One', 'minute', 'sensibly', 'arguing', 'United', 'States', 'business', 'Vietnam', 'next', 'minute', 'accepting', 'being', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'saying', 'United', 'States', 'see', 'situation', 'Also', 'watch', 'cameo', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'George', 'Wallace', 'reprising', 'previous', 'work', 'director', 'Frankenheimer.Bruce', 'McGill', 'also', 'excellent', 'role', 'George', 'Ball', 'trying', 'stress', 'President', 'cabinet', 'how', 'useless', 'wasteful', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'would', 'be.It', 'really', 'unbelievable', 'think', 'Johnson', 'ruined', 'long', 'outstanding', 'career', 'American', 'politics', 'getting', 'sucked', 'endless', 'quagmire', 'was', 'Vietnam', 'really', 'stunning', 'how', 'was', 'unraveled', 'so', 'quickly', 'think', 'how', 'America', 'went', 'Johnson', 'landslide', 'victory', '1964', 'Goldwater', 'Nixon', 'becoming', 'President', '1968.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'picture', 'sound', 'really', 'good', 'text', 'material', 'LBJ', 'tragic', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'DVD', 'HBO', 'movie', 'proud', 'just', 'really', 'fine', 'film', 'very', 'important', 'part', '20th', 'Century', 'American', 'history.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

731835,A6QMY5WPTVAT1,B00007M55W,"Gregory J. Casteel ""Dr. Gregory J. Casteel""","[2, 2]","This is the movie to watch if you want to understand why the U.S. was drawn into the quagmire of Vietnam -- why America's limited involvement in Southeast Asia during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, providing training and assistance to the South Vietnamese in their struggle against communist insurgents, escalated into a full-scale war during the Johnson administration -- a war that America could not win.  This is the movie to watch if you want to understand why President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who won the largest landslide electoral victory in American history, and who hoped to be remembered for his domestic policy successes -- the ""Great Society"", civil rights, voting rights, etc. -- instead came to be remembered mainly for his foreign policy failures.  This is the movie to watch if you want to understand how Johnson went from hero to villain in the eyes of America's idealistic youth.  This is the movie to watch if you want to understand Johnson, the man, and how the Vietnam War affected him personally.  This is the movie to watch if you want to understand what went on behind the scenes at the White House as Johnson, along with his family, cabinet officers, advisors, and aides -- Lady Bird Johnson, Robert McNamara, Clark Clifford, Dean Rusk, George Ball, Richard Goodwin, Bill Moyers, et al. -- dealt with the stress and uncertainty surrounding American involvement in Vietnam, while also having to deal with other pressing national issues, such as civil rights and the president's legislative agenda, as well as various personal crises, such as the health scare that Secretary of Defense McNamara's wife faced during one of the most tense moments of the war.  And this is the movie to watch if you want to understand how and why Bob McNamara -- the man who convinced Johnson to escalate the war -- ended up changing his position on Vietnam, coming to see the war as a mistake.  This is the movie to watch if you want to understand how frustrated and divided the Johnson administration was over what to do in Vietnam, and how people's positions on the war changed -- in both directions -- as events got out of control.  And this is the movie to watch if you want to understand how Vietnam destroyed Johnson's presidency, leading him to abandon his bid for a second term.  This is the movie to watch.Historically accurate, right down to the d&eacute;cor of the White House, and the reconnaissance photos and maps that are shown to the president, this movie gets the audience as close to the reality of what happened as is possible without a time machine.  Prominent historians who have specialized in studying the Johnson administration were used as consultants on this film; and a number of people who were actually present when these events happened attest to the veracity of the movie's portrayal of those events.  This movie was directed by the legendary John Frankenheimer (1930-2002), who is perhaps best known for his Cold War masterpiece, ""The Manchurian Candidate"", starring Frank Sinatra.  This was his last film before his death.  Famed Irish actor Michael Gambon stars as Lyndon Johnson; and there are moments in the film when the physical resemblance is uncanny -- though I was never fully convinced by the voice (Gambon has a deeper voice than LBJ, and the Texas accent sounded a bit off in places).  In the two main supporting roles, Donald Sutherland and Alec Baldwin turn in brilliantly convincing performances as Clark Clifford and Bob McNamara, respectively.  This is a high-quality film all around; and I was very impressed as I watched it.

He believed he could fuel the world's largest burgeoning economy, build a Great Society of wealth and equality, end the racial divide and conquer communism all at the same time.When he found he couldn't do all this -- and that he failed miserably in some efforts -- he turned away from politics and delivered his famous ""I shall not seek..."" speech from spring 1968.This movie probably better captures the spirit, emotion and personal drive of LBJ -- especially as it regards his decisions to engage in all out war in Vietnam -- than any of docudrama or film treatment of the man. It shows the man that was LBJ, a president that publicly picked up his beagle by the ears and once showed the White House press corps his surgical scar.While LBJ's handling of Alabama Gov. George Wallace and a few other events get some time in the biopic, it is the decision making about the Vietnam War that HBO best captured in this movie. Directed by John Frankenheimer and with significant roles for Donald Sutherland and Alec Baldwin as Clark Clifford and Robert McNamara, this film faithfully displays the network of advisors that surrounded LBJ, played well by Michael Gambon.Perhaps most moving of all scenes is the one where Clifford confronts the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Vietnam military commanders. ""What is the plan to win the war in Vietnam?"" Clifford asked. Stunned, no one has an answer. No scene, real or fictionalized, better summarizes the political life displayed in this film.Lovers of McNamara's embarassing self-serving documentary, ""The Fog of War"", will not be pleased to see their hero dethroned in this movie. In the early moments of the conflict, McNamara first straddles the fence on Vietnam, then pushes against doves including George Ball to get LBJ to commit big manpower in southeast Asia (just like he did in real life according to White House transcripts and the book ""The Pentagon Papers""). It is a far cry from the story the real McNamara wanted you to believe in his own foggy film.Whether all or none of the remaining scenes are true is not of much consequence. We all know what happened in Vietnam and we are seeing it played out day after day in Iraq right now, another quagmire in the making. American invovlement in the Vietnam war gave rise to a famous theory of irreversability -- that says the longer you move in one direction, the more difficult it is to reverse that direction.The time frame on Vietnam in this film is through 1968, when American sentiment turned against the war, as well as the thinking of most American politicians. Still, it was two presidents and seven years later before our involvement terminated. That's why the decision making on display in this movie is as important in 2005 as it was in 1968.

Donald Sutherland (Clark Clifford) and Alec Baldwin (Robert McNamara) are outstanding and Michael Gambon (Lyndon Johnson) also turns in a terrific performance of a President fighting the battles of ego and conscience. LBJ was a very complex personality and much of that persona comes through in the film. The eerie part is the comparison between then and now-a President from Texas, with two daughters, a divided country, fighting a war that doesn't seem winnable, against an enemy that is hard to quantify. In fact, it seems like many times during the movie you could just substitute Iraq for Vietnam and it would fit perfectly. Combines actual newsreel footage in the film making it feel even more real. Obviously, a very traumatic period in American history, this is a fascinating look behind the scenes at how we got into Vietnam and, finally, the decision LBJ made to start the peace process and not run for re-election so he could concentrate on ending the war. Sadly, he never lived to see the official end to the war. Watching this and THE FOG OF WAR, the Academy Award winning documentary about Robert McNamara, gives a great inside look at people behind the decisions that affect millions of people, here and abroad. You see the human frailties as well as strengths. At one point, LBJ was complaining toClark Clifford about the advice he had been given, and Clifford looked him in the eye, and told him that no matter what the decisions had been there were his and he alone had to take responsibility. A very powerful film worth watching.  While younger children probably won't be interested anyway, there is some language (LBJ was no saint) and a little bit of violence during the anti-war rallies.

Watching PATH TO WAR, one is reminded that the best brains of a rich and powerful country, guiding a huge military that for all intents and purposes is invincible, can still stumble on a recipe for defeat if they forget to read their Clausewitz.PATH opens with Lyndon Banes Johnson (Michael Gambon, who indeed bears a freakish resemblance to LBJ) getting re-elected to the presidency by a landslide in 1964. The former ""Master of the Senate"" has Congress in his pocket, and his head is bristling with plans to dismantle Jim Crow, improve education and health care for the poor, and build the so-called Great Society. Unfortunately he has a small thorn in his paw - this obscure Southeast Asian country called Vietnam, which the U.S. has been supporting against a communist insurgency with money and ""advisors"", but no official combat troops. Urged on by his military advisors, especially defense secretary Robert MacNamara (Alex Baldwin) and General William Westmoreland (Tom Skeritt), Johnson quietly begins to up-gun American commitment in Vietnam, with the insistence that the matter be resolved quickly. This action is opposed by Johnson's friend and advisor Clark Clifford (Donald Sutherland) and his undersecretary of defense, George Ball (Bruce McGill), but to no avail, and before too long, what begins as a military campaign is beginning to take on the appearances of a full-fledged war, one which begins to alienate Johnson from the people who elected him and to cause some of the ""the best brains"" to desert his slowly sinking ship like rats, while others flip-flop their opinions to such an extent that Johnson can no longer trust even his closest advisors.I've become a big fan of HBO Pictures in recent years, and this movie is a good example of why. It features a crackling script, some truly terrific performances from an ensemble cast of veteran character actors too numerous to mention, and it does a great job of conveying the mounting frustration of Johnson as he realizes he has traded the Great Society for a war he didn't want and isn't willing to win. The arguments between McGill and Baldwin, Baldwin and Sutherland, and Phillip Hoffman and Gambon, are all beautifully written, as is the vicious scene where Johnson execrates sciptwriter Jack Valenti for deserting him at a critical moment with the cry, ""There's blood on your hands, too!""Of course, PATH has some problems. It's portrayal of Johnson is very kindhearted, almost to the point of a whitewash, and it takes an even softer view of MacNamara, who many peace activists consider a war criminal and many combat veterans consider an incompetent who cost our military thousands of needless deaths with his arrogant micromanaging. Also, the portrayal of Clark Clifford, while enjoyable, remains a bit too enigmatic for my taste. But viewed overall, this is a very good film, part tragedy and part warning, whose moral seems to be, ""If you're going to go to war, go all the way...or not at all.""",5,"Or, How To Wreck A Presidency & Divide A Nation",1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,3090,"['road', 'hell', 'paved', 'good', 'intentions', 'also', 'paved', 'navete', 'arrogance', 'bureacratic', 'stupidity', 'Watching', 'PATH', 'TO', 'WAR', 'one', 'reminded', 'best', 'brains', 'rich', 'powerful', 'country', 'guiding', 'huge', 'military', 'intents', 'purposes', 'invincible', 'can', 'still', 'stumble', 'recipe', 'defeat', 'forget', 'read', 'Clausewitz.PATH', 'Lyndon', 'Banes', 'Johnson', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'who', 'indeed', 'freakish', 'resemblance', 'LBJ', 'getting', 're-elected', 'presidency', 'landslide', '1964', 'former', 'Master', 'Senate', 'Congress', 'pocket', 'head', 'bristling', 'plans', 'dismantle', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'improve', 'education', 'health', 'care', 'poor', 'build', 'so-called', 'Great', 'Society', 'Unfortunately', 'small', 'thorn', 'paw', 'obscure', 'Southeast', 'Asian', 'country', 'called', 'Vietnam', 'U.S.', 'been', 'supporting', 'communist', 'insurgency', 'money', 'advisors', 'official', 'combat', 'troops', 'Urged', 'military', 'advisors', 'especially', 'defense', 'secretary', 'Robert', 'MacNamara', 'Alex', 'Baldwin', 'General', 'William', 'Westmoreland', 'Tom', 'Skeritt', 'Johnson', 'quietly', 'up-gun', 'American', 'commitment', 'Vietnam', 'insistence', 'matter', 'be', 'resolved', 'quickly', 'action', 'opposed', 'Johnson', 'friend', 'advisor', 'Clark', 'Clifford', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'undersecretary', 'defense', 'George', 'Ball', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'avail', 'too', 'long', 'what', 'military', 'campaign', 'beginning', 'take', 'appearances', 'full-fledged', 'war', 'one', 'alienate', 'Johnson', 'people', 'who', 'elected', 'cause', 'best', 'brains', 'desert', 'slowly', 'sinking', 'ship', 'rats', 'others', 'flip-flop', 'opinions', 'extent', 'Johnson', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'trust', 'even', 'closest', 'advisors.I', ""'ve"", 'become', 'big', 'fan', 'HBO', 'Pictures', 'recent', 'years', 'movie', 'good', 'example', 'why', 'crackling', 'script', 'truly', 'terrific', 'performances', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'veteran', 'character', 'actors', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'great', 'job', 'conveying', 'mounting', 'frustration', 'Johnson', 'traded', 'Great', 'Society', 'war', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', ""n't"", 'willing', 'win', 'arguments', 'McGill', 'Baldwin', 'Baldwin', 'Sutherland', 'Phillip', 'Hoffman', 'Gambon', 'are', 'beautifully', 'written', 'vicious', 'scene', 'where', 'Johnson', 'sciptwriter', 'Jack', 'Valenti', 'deserting', 'critical', 'moment', 'cry', 'blood', 'hands', 'too', 'course', 'PATH', 'problems', 'portrayal', 'Johnson', 'very', 'kindhearted', 'almost', 'point', 'whitewash', 'even', 'softer', 'view', 'MacNamara', 'who', 'many', 'peace', 'activists', 'consider', 'war', 'criminal', 'many', 'combat', 'veterans', 'consider', 'incompetent', 'who', 'cost', 'military', 'thousands', 'needless', 'deaths', 'arrogant', 'micromanaging', 'Also', 'portrayal', 'Clark', 'Clifford', 'enjoyable', 'bit', 'too', 'enigmatic', 'taste', 'viewed', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'part', 'tragedy', 'part', 'warning', 'moral', 'be', ""'re"", 'going', 'go', 'war', 'go', 'way', 'not']",N/A

Instead I want to focus on the realism of not only the events, but the production values.I felt as though I was whisked back in my teen and early adult years from the very first scene. The offices, street scenes, interior shots and even the clothes and uniforms are exact. I not only grew up in this era, but LBJ was my commander-in-chief, and I served under both Secretaries of Defense McNamara and Clark Clifford.While I will confess that I did not know, care about, or appreciate the magnitude of the events depicted in this movie, research shows that they are historically correct. Or at least substantially so. At this point in my life I am seeking reasons why we were bogged down in Vietnam and this movie gives some clear reasons about the whats and whys. My biggest take away, though, is the behind-the-scenes machinations, personalities and the political realism.Another aspect of this film that makes it an uncanny glimpse into the past is the resemblance of the actors to the people they portray. In one case Jack Valenti's son John portrays him.For my generation, and especially those of us who were serving in Vietnam when the events in this movie took place, this is a collection of answers.

It shows clearly how LBJ was so afraid of appearing weak to any number of groups that he acted aggressively.  It also shows that he was the type of person who couldn't stand to lose and had a tremendous personal grudge in winning the war.  The portrayals of Robert McNamara are uncannily accurate and Alec Baldwin does a tremendous job of showing him as someone who believed that anything could be predicted, measured and accounted for.What makes this movie so believable is the fine acting throughout.  Alec Baldwin is amazing, as Bob McNamara and Michael Gambon is great as LBJ.  Donald Sutherland is fantastic as Clark Clifford.  In fact there is hardly a weak link in this entire program.

It's really revealing to see the degree which Johnson fought such a limited and overly-analyzed war.  In the movie, he is portrayed as having a huge amount of guilt of any deaths, on either side.  Look, this is war......either don't wage it......or wage it to win.What is not known by many people is that militarily , The US was winning most battles and exacting a heavier toll than the VC was inflicting on us.  However, due to Johnson's (and his administration's) guilt and reluctance to wage a war to WIN, the peace movement at home who was rooting for the vc, and the media who was against the war and constantly referred to it as ""unwinnable"".....the Viet Cong leaders acquired courage and took heart.  These anti-war elements gave the Viet Cong the fortitude to keep fighting.For example, after the Tet Offensive....which was a great military victory for the USA....our military having utterly repelled the offensive of the VC....the North Vietnamese leaders began to notice reports from the USA which were reporting the battle as different from what it was.  One VC leader was quoted to have said that he felt they were defeated after their route at Tet.....yet upon seeing reports from the US, by the anti-war US media, that reported it was a defeat for the US.....his communist troops took heart and knew they must continue the fight.In several parts of the film.....Johnson and members of his adminstration expound upon how tough and unbeatable the Viet Cong were.  They seem to almost be fawning over the fact of the invincibility of the foe.  This coupled with the limited war.....over-analysis by washington bureaucrats on actually picking targets.....not letting the military sweep into the North.....lead to our eventual demise there.After Johnson was voted out...because of his squeamishness in fighting the war....Nixon was elected.  He did his best to end the war nobly....scaling back troops while escalating the bombimg.  At the Paris Peace Accords, he created a truce between the North and the South which was backed up by the threat of U.S. military action should the North reneg and invade the South.But, alas, the congressional democrats, using the cover of watergate, frantically went after Nixon causing him to resign, thus in effect closing the door on the South.  Gerald Ford subsequently pleaded with the democratic congress not to turn our backs on the South....but they did.The legacy that followed was one of death and blood.  The North swept into the south.  Laos and Cambodia were invaded by the commies.  Hundreds of thousands were thrown into conmmunist concentration and reeducation camps and in Cambodia....the killing fields ensued.  Children watched as their parents were murdered ( often beheaded or garroted )by the red regime.In all, a good film that accurately gets across the mindset of the Johnson administration.

Path to War is one more example of the excellence of HBO productions.John Frankenheimer directs his talented cast with a sure hand.  Michael Gambon, the famous Irish/English actor, does a fine job as Lyndon Johnson.  He does not want the war in Viet Nam, but he is misled into thinking that first it was necessary to stop the spread of communism in South East Asia, and second that the war was winnable.  Robert McNamara, played convincingly by Alec Baldwin, acting on false information, convinces Johnson to go to war and for three years supports the generals such as William Westmoreland who continue to ask for more troops and more bombing.  Clark Clifford, well-acted by Donald Southerland, tells Johnson right at the beginning of American involvement in Viet Nam that the war is unwinnable, but Johnson ignores his good advice and supports instead McNamara and his generals.  ""Things fall apart and the center does not hold.""  His health seriously compromised by the tremendous pressure of his office and the disaster of a war that continues to escalate with no end in sight, Johnson decides not to run for reelection and the film comes to a close.This is a film, not a history lesson, yet director Frankenheimer tries to stay as close to the facts as possible.  My guess is that historians will have much to criticize concerning the accuracy of this presentation of Johnson and the war in Viet Nam, but Path to War is not a documentary.  Its main purpose is to dramatize the impact of the war on the politicians like Johnson who are trying to do the right thing, but are sadly misguided by false information provided by the military establishment.  Many viewers will think about Iraq and Afghanistan and draw parallels with Path to War.The running time for this film is almost three hours, but for me the time flew by as I had a chance to step back in time and relive the disaster of the first three years of the war in Viet Nam.  I wondered what it must be like to be president and to have to live each day with the enormous pressure of knowing that decisions you make are going to mean the difference between life and death for American soldiers and Vietnamese citizens.

And so it became obvious watching this brilliant HBO film that with the best will in the world President Johnson and his cohorts had no comprehension of what they were getting into either. It was only later when the reports came back describing how villagers cycled down to a stricken train to help unload it (the lines had been destroyed by US bombing) and painstakingly moved the items on board the train to handlebars of bicycles to be ferried to another train further down the line. How they built devices across rivers to replace blown up bridges, and how they determinedly went on with their lives as best they could that the White House staff realised with growing alarm that they could be in this war forever.Johnson himself comes across as a man under enormous pressure, much of it caused by his insecurity and self doubts. The rest of course was brought upon him by the Vietnam war,which wrecked his health and eventually him destroyed him.This is an excellent, accurate portrayal of the machinations of Vietnam as I remember it, and it paints a picture of men trying to grapple with a war they don't understand, fearful of defeat (unthinkable) the escalating cost and Johnson's programmes to help the poor and Civil Rights in danger of being lost as the national budget is blown to smithereens.Micahel Gambon was magnificent as LBJ, as was Donald Sutherland.The film is engrossing from beginning to end, in fact the whole DVD package is a must have in my opinion.",5,Vietnam War - The Inner Machinations,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,1852,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'letterbox', 'name', 'Director', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'was', 'what', 'originally', 'caught', 'attention', 'was', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'generation.When', 'war', 'broke', 'out', 'remember', 'father', 'saying', 'was', 'unwinnable', 'war', 'course', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'meant', 'who', 'had', 'served', 'AIF', 'New', 'Guinea', 'WW11', 'became', 'obvious', 'watching', 'brilliant', 'HBO', 'film', 'best', 'will', 'world', 'President', 'Johnson', 'cohorts', 'had', 'comprehension', 'what', 'were', 'getting', 'was', 'only', 'later', 'when', 'reports', 'came', 'back', 'describing', 'how', 'villagers', 'cycled', 'down', 'stricken', 'train', 'help', 'unload', 'lines', 'had', 'been', 'destroyed', 'US', 'bombing', 'painstakingly', 'moved', 'items', 'board', 'train', 'handlebars', 'bicycles', 'be', 'ferried', 'train', 'further', 'down', 'line', 'How', 'built', 'devices', 'rivers', 'replace', 'blown', 'up', 'bridges', 'how', 'determinedly', 'went', 'lives', 'best', 'could', 'White', 'House', 'staff', 'realised', 'growing', 'alarm', 'could', 'be', 'war', 'forever.Johnson', 'across', 'man', 'enormous', 'pressure', 'much', 'caused', 'insecurity', 'self', 'doubts', 'rest', 'course', 'was', 'brought', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'wrecked', 'health', 'eventually', 'destroyed', 'him.This', 'excellent', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'machinations', 'Vietnam', 'remember', 'picture', 'men', 'trying', 'grapple', 'war', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'fearful', 'defeat', 'unthinkable', 'escalating', 'cost', 'Johnson', 'programmes', 'help', 'poor', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'danger', 'being', 'lost', 'national', 'budget', 'blown', 'smithereens.Micahel', 'Gambon', 'was', 'magnificent', 'LBJ', 'was', 'Donald', 'Sutherland.The', 'film', 'engrossing', 'beginning', 'end', 'fact', 'whole', 'DVD', 'package', 'must', 'have', 'opinion']",N/A

Johnson.  The movie, director Frankenheimer's last, was produced and released in 2002 as the United States was preparing to launch a war against Iraq.  As such it serves as a cautionary tale with a strong political point of view - the message is simple and strong: Even the best and the brightest can be blinded by optimism, and a quagmire once entered is not easily left.THE PATH TO WAR spends a great deal of time in cabinet meetings.  This is a political drama pitting special advisor Clark Clifford (Donald Sutherland) against Defense Secretary Robert McNamara (Alec Baldwin) in battle for the heart and mind of President Johnson (Michael Gambon).  Clifford is the Dove, the main player advocating restraint and caution viz. Vietnam, while McNamara Hawkishly counsels a steady buildup of American forces. At first English actor Gambon seemed an odd choice for the role of Texas-born Johnson.  He fits the part physically, and he's the right age, but his west Texas accent is a bit off the mark.  Not terribly off, but he doesn't nail it either.  Johnson is a familiar television presence from my youth and his heavy drawl must have made a deep impression.  In any event, it was distracting for a while, but Gambon is such a strong actor, and otherwise so right for the part that I stopped worrying about it after a while.Frankenheimer was a personal friend of Johnson's arch-foe Robert Kennedy, and a generation ago Frankenheimer might have treated Johnson as a bit more of a political monster.  Indeed, Johnson the politician could play rough.  In one early scene, Johnson gives the mailed-fist-in-the-velvet-glove treatment to Alabama Governor George Wallace (Gary Sinise) when Wallace threatens Johnson's civil rights' initiatives.  Later, when speech writer Dick Goodwin (James Frain), the man who `put the music' in Johnson's speeches, tells Johnson that he's leaving to accept a fellowship, Johnson, in the space of perhaps three minutes, bribes, cajoles, and ultimately threatens Goodwin into staying.  Still, the ultimate impression of Johnson is of a man whose presidency was ruined because of a misplaced reliance on advisors rather than an innate blood lust.  The villains in THE PATH TO WAR are arrogance, an overestimation of America's military capabilities, and a woeful underestimation of North Vietnam's willingness to engage in a prolonged and costly war.  The worst player in this cast turns out to be McNamara, who is partly redeemed by his doubts at the end.THE PATH TO WAR is a very good HBO movie.  There aren't many extras on the disk.  The making of and cast interviews are very short - three or four minutes per extra - and not terribly informative or insightful.

The details of the key decision-makers and advisors are fascinating.  With the help of hindsight we want to yell at them for their failure to see where the war was leading and the devastation it would leave in its wake.  Some may argue that it gives a somewhat more favorable view of LBJ than what he deserves in history, perhaps.  But, on the other hand, it portrays the times he was too easily swayed by one side and belittled or ignored dissent.  There is little doubt LBJ felt the weight of his responsibility in the war.  It is also apparent how he saw the war and the fear of being weak as costing him the ""great society"" he wished to create.  A very good and somewhat sympathetic view of a president overwhelmed by the political pressures brought about by the Vietnam quagmire.",5,"LBJ, a political casualty of war",1098748800,"10 26, 2004",2004,923,"['entertaining', 'instructive', 'somewhat', 'lengthy', 'film', 'political', 'fallout', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'Johnson', 'administration', 'details', 'key', 'decision-makers', 'advisors', 'are', 'fascinating', 'help', 'hindsight', 'want', 'yell', 'failure', 'see', 'where', 'war', 'was', 'leading', 'devastation', 'would', 'leave', 'wake', 'may', 'argue', 'somewhat', 'more', 'favorable', 'view', 'LBJ', 'what', 'history', 'perhaps', 'other', 'hand', 'times', 'was', 'too', 'easily', 'swayed', 'one', 'side', 'belittled', 'ignored', 'dissent', 'little', 'doubt', 'LBJ', 'felt', 'weight', 'responsibility', 'war', 'also', 'apparent', 'how', 'saw', 'war', 'fear', 'being', 'weak', 'costing', 'great', 'society', 'wished', 'create', 'very', 'good', 'somewhat', 'sympathetic', 'view', 'president', 'overwhelmed', 'political', 'pressures', 'brought', 'about', 'Vietnam', 'quagmire']",N/A

I enjoyed the movie a lot, but I didn't like seeing the scene with that antiwar freak of an idiot putting his little daughter at risk while burning himself to death in front of the Pentagon. The little girl could've caught fire as well, and it would've accomplished NOTHING at all in changing the policies of the Vietnam War, except becoming a martyr in the eyes of the North Vietnamese. Sheesh!Other than that, the movie is an excellent buy and is nearly three hours long. It seems to have kept me in suspense for every minute of it as well.",5,The LBJ administration in detail,1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,689,"['movie', 'war', 'years', '1964', '1968', 'covering', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'president', 'handling', 'bombing', 'raids', 'other', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'lot', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'seeing', 'scene', 'antiwar', 'freak', 'idiot', 'putting', 'little', 'daughter', 'risk', 'burning', 'death', 'front', 'Pentagon', 'little', 'girl', 'could', ""'ve"", 'caught', 'fire', 'well', 'would', ""'ve"", 'accomplished', 'NOTHING', 'changing', 'policies', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'becoming', 'martyr', 'eyes', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'Sheesh', 'Other', 'movie', 'excellent', 'buy', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'have', 'kept', 'suspense', 'minute', 'as', 'well']",N/A
