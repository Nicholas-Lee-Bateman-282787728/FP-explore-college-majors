The beginning until the part with the plane is boring but it has meaning like every scene in the whole movie. As some seen from the trailer, wolves will be playing somewhat the main role in the movie. They will be done with very good special effects, and they will be far from the wolves you see in real life. They will be very cruel. While I don't like this part because it promotes hatred towards animals and these species in general I liked the fact that humans in general will get their soft places kicked real hard. It's a good addition to today's movies. Finally it goes the other way around than what we used to see on Tv. The characters are likable. The movie falls perfectly between a good and a bad movie. It's a fine movie (3-4 stars). Since the movie is quite dark and depressing it's not surprise that in general it's rated 3 stars. The movie is really good, but I don't like depressing movies. Anyway it's a movie that I recommend but not to everyone. You might get something useful out of it, that is if you like thinking of course. Needless to say, acting was quite good!Really I can't recall anything being wrong with the movie. Last but not least, it's important that you know that it is rated ''R'' for a reason.

I'm getting to the point where I can tell if a movie is going to be good, in say, hmm, fifteen seconds to three minutes. I knew The Grey was going to be bad when (SPOILER ALERT) Liam Neeson, in the first fifteen seconds says, ""a summary killer,"" in describing what he does. I barely could pick up what he said, but there it was, yup, ""summary killer."" IMHO, one does not begin ones' movie with a difficult word like ""summary killer,"" within the first fifteen seconds. It's like WTF? WTF is a summary killer? Having a lit degree, yah, I know what it means. But mr. average movieguy? He turns to his girlfriend and says- ""what did he just say?"" She doesn't want to answer him, cuz she's busy trying to figure out WTF he just said and it goes on from there.Next, there's a delicious shot of ol' brother Liam lining up on a grey wolf that (SPOILER ALERT DELUXE) that just happens to beeline out of the forest, yup, I mean that sincerely, runs, straight out of concealing woods toward three men standing around an oil or gas pipeline. GOOD THING ol' Liam was there, READY, to dust that evil toad, his mean, lean killing machine hefted at his shoulder. And he does what must be done. Cuz, he knew, that Grey was gonna BEELINE out of the woods, spring over one hundred and fifty feet of open field and attack three grown MALE OIL PIPELINE WORKERS because, well, because he was houngry... But lucky ol' Liam was there, to save the pipeline workers.I guess the film deserves one star, because, as I watched it, I realized I had chores to do and, because of the depressing tone of this movie, I realized I had better get them done before some wolf did me in.I really wonder how many wolves are going to be killed as a result of this movie.",1,Wotta  joke,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,1756,"['guess', 'just', ""'m"", 'getting', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'say', 'hmm', 'fifteen', 'seconds', 'three', 'minutes', 'knew', 'Grey', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'bad', 'when', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'first', 'fifteen', 'seconds', 'summary', 'killer', 'describing', 'what', 'barely', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'what', 'said', 'was', 'yup', 'summary', 'killer', 'IMHO', 'one', 'not', 'begin', 'ones', 'movie', 'difficult', 'word', 'summary', 'killer', 'first', 'fifteen', 'seconds', 'WTF', 'WTF', 'summary', 'killer', 'Having', 'lit', 'degree', 'yah', 'know', 'what', 'mr.', 'average', 'movieguy', 'girlfriend', 'says-', 'what', 'did', 'just', 'say', ""n't"", 'want', 'answer', 'busy', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'WTF', 'just', 'said', 'there.Next', 'delicious', 'shot', 'ol', 'brother', 'Liam', 'lining', 'up', 'grey', 'wolf', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'DELUXE', 'just', 'beeline', 'forest', 'yup', 'mean', 'sincerely', 'runs', 'straight', 'concealing', 'woods', 'three', 'men', 'standing', 'oil', 'gas', 'pipeline', 'GOOD', 'THING', 'ol', 'Liam', 'was', 'there', 'READY', 'dust', 'evil', 'toad', 'mean', 'lean', 'killing', 'machine', 'hefted', 'shoulder', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'Cuz', 'knew', 'Grey', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'BEELINE', 'woods', 'spring', 'one', 'hundred', 'fifty', 'feet', 'open', 'field', 'attack', 'three', 'grown', 'MALE', 'OIL', 'PIPELINE', 'WORKERS', 'well', 'was', 'houngry', 'lucky', 'ol', 'Liam', 'was', 'there', 'save', 'pipeline', 'workers.I', 'guess', 'film', 'one', 'star', 'because', 'watched', 'realized', 'had', 'chores', 'do', 'depressing', 'tone', 'movie', 'realized', 'had', 'better', 'get', 'done', 'wolf', 'did', 'in.I', 'really', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'wolves', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'killed', 'result', 'movie']",The Grey

1490915,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B005LAIIS0,Andre Dursin,"[2, 4]","Liam Neeson's determined performance - one of his best - anchors THE GREY, one of this year's more memorable cinematic excursions to date. Viewers who might've missed director Joe Carnahan's film in theaters ought to check out the picture on video.Carnahan, who adapted a book by Ian McKenzie Jeffers with the author, has fashioned a gripping account of a disparate group of Alaskan oil drillers who crash in the frozen wilderness and are subsequently attacked by a pack of hungry wolves. It's essentially a frigid ""Deliverance"" but with some poetic passages as Neeson and his fellow survivors dig themselves out and try to stay alive, occasionally stopping to deliberate on the meaning of life, the existence of God and why in the world these starving hunters won't give them a break.Atmospherically shot in British Columbia and filled with memorable set-pieces, ""The Grey"" is exciting and well-executed on nearly every front, save for some occasionally spotty uses of CGI. Still, Neeson's gritty performance says it all: his John Ottway might have been dealt a few bad hands, but the character opts to go down fighting, and the film's spirituality adds depth to a picture that, even on just a pure surface level, ranks as one of the more compelling outdoor-adventure yarns in recent memory.Universal's Blu-Ray looks terrific with its 1080p transfer and sounds even better with a marvelously mixed DTS MA soundtrack layered with surround activity. Extra features aren't overwhelming - just some deleted scenes and a commentary by Carnahan - while a DVD and digital copy round out the release.",4,"Great Neeson performance in a strange, compelling outdoor thriller",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,1593,"['Liam', 'Neeson', 'determined', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'anchors', 'THE', 'GREY', 'one', 'year', 'more', 'memorable', 'cinematic', 'excursions', 'date', 'Viewers', 'who', 'might', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'director', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'film', 'theaters', 'ought', 'check', 'out', 'picture', 'video.Carnahan', 'who', 'adapted', 'book', 'Ian', 'McKenzie', 'Jeffers', 'author', 'fashioned', 'gripping', 'account', 'disparate', 'group', 'Alaskan', 'oil', 'drillers', 'who', 'crash', 'frozen', 'wilderness', 'are', 'subsequently', 'attacked', 'pack', 'hungry', 'wolves', 'essentially', 'frigid', 'Deliverance', 'poetic', 'passages', 'Neeson', 'fellow', 'survivors', 'dig', 'try', 'stay', 'alive', 'occasionally', 'stopping', 'deliberate', 'meaning', 'life', 'existence', 'God', 'why', 'world', 'starving', 'hunters', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'break.Atmospherically', 'shot', 'British', 'Columbia', 'filled', 'memorable', 'set-pieces', 'Grey', 'exciting', 'well-executed', 'nearly', 'front', 'save', 'occasionally', 'spotty', 'uses', 'CGI', 'Still', 'Neeson', 'gritty', 'performance', 'John', 'Ottway', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'dealt', 'few', 'bad', 'hands', 'character', 'opts', 'go', 'down', 'fighting', 'film', 'spirituality', 'depth', 'picture', 'even', 'just', 'pure', 'surface', 'level', 'one', 'more', 'compelling', 'outdoor-adventure', 'yarns', 'recent', 'memory.Universal', 'Blu-Ray', 'looks', 'terrific', '1080p', 'transfer', 'even', 'better', 'marvelously', 'mixed', 'DTS', 'MA', 'soundtrack', 'layered', 'surround', 'activity', 'Extra', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'overwhelming', 'just', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'Carnahan', 'DVD', 'digital', 'copy', 'round', 'release']",The Grey

1490919,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B005LAIIS0,Armando N. Roman,"[2, 3]","Liam Neeson has quickly become an even bigger star than he already was thanks to the first Taken movie. Since then, he's appeared in more action movies, with the big one after Taken being The Grey. I was excited to see it, as the trailers showed just enough to get you interested, and it looked like he was going to be fighting wolves instead of European traffickers.However, the trailer is probably the reason this movie's getting so many mixed reviews.Neeson plays Ottoway, a marksman who was hired to kill wolves in Alaska. He's haunted by flashbacks of his wife, and sets out to kill himself after taking out a wolf. He's unable to do so, and heads back for his plane to go home with the oil workers. It's a stormy night though and the plane has a lot of turbulence, making for a bumpy flight. The bumpy flight soon turns into a nightmare- the plane is ripped apart in mid-flight and crashes. Ottoway wakes up and sees complete destruction (to say the least), finding only a small handful of survivors. The men set up camp at the crash site for the night, only to be disturbed by wolves. These wolves aren't just passing by though...they want the men dead. Even a little provoking by one of the men proves to be a big mistake as the wolves respond, showing just how outnumbered the men are. In the middle of nowhere, without any real supplies and weapons, and with a bad egg or two in the group, how are they going to make it out of this alive?There's so much that could've been standard with The Grey, but I was amazed at how quickly things moved along and how it kept my interest from beginning to end. Ottoway is a great character, not being the perfect leader. How often do we get stories like this, where the group is led by someone with no flaws? Ottoway admits that he's scared right off the bat, and that there's no shame in it. Why bother trying to show how manly you are in a situation like this? He might come off as cool and relaxed, but the guy shares a couple of laughs with the others at appropriate times. It's good to see that. The other survivors are all given a good amount of time for the most part, and whenever one of them was threatened, no matter how they may have been acting just seconds before, I cared. One man tells a story about his daughter and her long hair, how she'll swing it around in his face to get him up. We find out that another had a sister that passed away when he was a kid, and he still hurts from it. There's a lot I want to say about these characters but doing so would ruin a bit of the movie.The cast is good, and The Grey has a lot more than just that going for it. The Alaskan scenery is absolutely beautiful. A lot of the locations reminded me of the snowy winters of Oregon I saw when I was younger. There's a scene that takes place by a stream, and you can tell that the director let it play out long enough for you to enjoy the beauty. And how about the plane crash at the beginning? Good lord, I haven't seen anything that intense in a long time. The last big plane crash scene I saw was probably in the first Final Destination, and the one here easily beats it. Before it was even halfway over, I didn't ever want to step foot on a plane again, blizzard or not. One more thing I'll mention is the 'philosophical' nature of the movie. A lot of people have complained about this, and I don't understand why. It's not overdone, not preachy, and it was cool getting something like that in an action-thriller movie. The only thing slightly overdone is the poem that Ottoway reads a couple of times. It's a great poem the first and last time we hear it, and I wish it was only these two times that we heard it.What keeps The Grey from getting a full 5 stars in my book is the wolf attack scenes...and I can't really fault them for how they did it. Wolf attack sequences are usually done at night with a lot of camera movement to add suspense. The first time the wolves attacked, I was on the edge of my seat, and also unsure of what exactly was going on because it seemed like I was staring at a black screen for a few seconds at one point. In fact, I'm pretty sure I was. I feel things could've been a little cleaner with this part. I'm just glad they didn't take the cheap way out and give us CG wolves. How embarrassing would it be to see men facing the elements, and then a CG wolf pops out? The other small complaint I have is just a pattern I noticed about the movie. It made me laugh when I realized that the movie's pattern is: walk, set up camp, get attacked, walk, set up camp, get attacked. Of course they do a little more here and there. It's just something I noticed.Those little nitpicks aside, I didn't have any problems with the ending. With how much the poem is drilled into your head, I thought it was pretty obvious what happened, especially when you see the quick scene after the credits. I guess if people are complaining about a movie being 'too philosophical', then it shouldn't surprise me that the ending needs to be spoon-fed to them.

This is not one of those movies.  As a friend of mine often says, ""It is what it is"".  Meaning take it for what it is because we can't always have what we want and we must use what we have.  Even survivalist will find some of it daunting.  Perhaps the cold and hunger affects their judgement because there are some mistakes made.  But then even in the best of conditions people prove they are only human every day.  Some perhaps expect perfect heroes that have all the answers, and they aren't in this movie.I enjoy survival movies and even with movies likeEight Below [Blu-ray] that don't have the happiest of endings, you learn from the journey.  You will learn from it and Liam Neeson gives a magnificent performance.  He has perfected his craft and does a wonderful job of pulling us into this cruel wilderness that he must try to survive after a plane crash leaves him and a handful of passenegers alive and surrounded by giant gray wolves.  If you find yourself skeptical of their decisions or the wolves, I'd say you haven't done that much camping in the wild or you aren't familiar with this variety that kills for sport.  Not a day goes by when even smart people make the dumbest decisions that should make them candidates for the Darwin Awards.Keep in mind this group of survivors has no weapons, only fire to keep the wolves off them.  Add to that most of them are bleeding, and predators like wolves can certainly sense fear as well.  If you're still skeptical of the wolves size and behavior let me tell you I was until I found out it's not unrealistic at all.  I found articles about the large wolf packs in Canada that came from the introduction of 35 large Canadian gray wolves into Idaho and Yellowstone in Wyoming.  So those that tell you wolves aren't like this are basing their opinion on the smaller wolf varieties that were indigenous previously and now thought to be extinct in the United States.  Large packs of gray wolves are now roaming Northern US and they are aggressive enough to have not only attacked livestock, but humans in ever increasing numbers.

1490937,A14S6T4O968UKU,B005LAIIS0,"Carol Kean ""Carol K""","[4, 10]","The Grey opens with Liam Neeson shooting a wolf. End of movie for me, but my husband challenged me to watch this nonsense to the bitter end. Apparently the Alaska oil rigs hire sharpshooters to kill wolves, which must unleash some truly bad karma on the blue collar men in this movie. Not to worry, these men deserve to die. Hollywood shows us these dregs of society in their last happy night on earth--after drilling for oil in the wilderness, they go carousing, drinking, fighting, cursing like sailors, I mean, er, oil-rig workers. Then these rowdies board the plane home and for some turbulent reason it crashes. No need to cry for them; they're oil rig workers, and their vocabulary is limited to 4-letter words. Well, except for Liam, of course, who can even recite a poem his dad wrote, something Hemingway-esque, nihilistic and macho. He can also play Mr. Sensitive and hold the hand of a dying man. Funny how this movie tries to give each scumbag a redeeming virtue or a tender moment before a wolf eats him.So Liam shot a wolf, then the plane crashed in the wilderness and most of the oil workers died. Some survived, even though hungry wolves kept trying to eat them, which is not normal wolf behavior. End of story? No such luck.The survivors feel lucky, maybe even chosen by God for a higher purpose, but then they keep dying one by one, and frankly it would have been better to die instantly in the crash. No explanation is given for all the wolves of Alaska to come snarling to the plane wreck, driving the survivors into the...forest?? Gosh, men are such idiots! And wolves are such crazed, wild, hungry predators! Nothing noble or beautiful about them, and no reason for Hollywood to make any attempt at portraying them naturally. Hey, National Geographic does that, right? So let's pretend wolves act like this, to make the movie really scary, and let's let some of the men show some humanity, so that viewers don't totally rejoice each time one dies. We haven't sunk to the level of The Hunger Games *yet* -- but this movie might help ease us into the idea that it's fun to watch people die in the wilderness. Especially when they're only guys.I detest male-bashing, especially in Disney cartoons aimed at kids--fathers are idiots, except Simba's dad, so he has to die in the most traumatizing way Disney can think of. Then again, if guys spend their hard earned money on movies like this, who am I to defend the male gender? Then again...when women waste money on chick flicks such as 27 Dresses, The Notebook, and other embarrassments, I can't defend my gender, either.

Liam Neeson leads a cast of  actors in a combination of WOLFEN (1981) attacks meets ALIVE (1993) the plane crash, with maybe a little frozen isolation of THE THING (1982) thrown in. A contracted game hunter named Ottway (Neeson) is hired to protect oilfield workers from predatorial wolves in Alaska, or the Artic. The film begins with Ottway battling his loss of love and unhappiness with himself as he is surrounded by low-lives and drunken misfits. His memories of love making with his woman are effectively weaved into this wasteland and an effective plane crash sequence both, but the real surprises are with the wolf packs that turn the tables on his small group of survivors as they become the prey. I remember seeing WOLFEN, with Albert Finney, when it came out about the lore of indigenous natives as ""shapes-shifters"" getting even with big business for land development and the wolves vision being thermographic, those elements made WOLFEN weak, but the horror factor is there for me as it is in THE GREY.THE GREY successfully places you in a frozen tundra, as THE THING did, with a feeling of isolation and vulnerability. Yet, as fragile and easy a target these men are, surrounded by beast, not canine or dog like animals, but huge bear sized wolves as one of the fellow survivors, Diaz (Frank Grillo), a fool turned sacrificial lamb, screams at the howling packs after almost losing his life in an attack and yells into the dark, eerie night, ""You're not the animals, we're the animals"" and proceeds to cut a dead omega wolfs head off as the men feast on its carcass, which they intentionally roast and eat for the pack to see from the dark treeline. Ottways attempt in the beginning of the film to end his own misery may well have been the reason his fate gives him the opportunity to choose between being another sacrificial lamb, or the alpha male himself, but not without ""one last fray""? The film deals with each mans mortality and how we choose, or do not choose, to die. One interesting element expressed in the film is how people seem to see their loved ones as death approaches in the form of spirits or memories. I had always thought this to be soley a Native American thing, evidently, its in all cultures. The fight for survival is the films theme whether you be man, or beast and that sometimes, you have to be both in order to win your fight and that like wolves, men are either alpha or omega males.",4,We are the animals!,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,2665,"['had', 'idea', 'film', 'held', 'so', 'many', 'surprises', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'thought', 'provoking', 'drama', 'questioning', 'existence', 'god', 'faith', 'devote', 'appreciation', 'poetic', 'realism', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'cast', 'actors', 'combination', 'WOLFEN', '1981', 'attacks', 'meets', 'ALIVE', '1993', 'plane', 'crash', 'maybe', 'little', 'frozen', 'isolation', 'THE', 'THING', '1982', 'thrown', 'contracted', 'game', 'hunter', 'named', 'Ottway', 'Neeson', 'hired', 'protect', 'oilfield', 'workers', 'predatorial', 'wolves', 'Alaska', 'Artic', 'film', 'Ottway', 'battling', 'loss', 'love', 'unhappiness', 'surrounded', 'low-lives', 'drunken', 'misfits', 'memories', 'love', 'making', 'woman', 'are', 'effectively', 'weaved', 'wasteland', 'effective', 'plane', 'crash', 'sequence', 'real', 'surprises', 'are', 'wolf', 'turn', 'tables', 'small', 'group', 'survivors', 'become', 'prey', 'remember', 'seeing', 'WOLFEN', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'lore', 'indigenous', 'natives', 'shapes-shifters', 'getting', 'even', 'big', 'business', 'land', 'development', 'wolves', 'vision', 'being', 'thermographic', 'elements', 'made', 'WOLFEN', 'weak', 'horror', 'factor', 'there', 'THE', 'GREY.THE', 'GREY', 'successfully', 'frozen', 'tundra', 'THE', 'THING', 'did', 'feeling', 'isolation', 'vulnerability', 'Yet', 'fragile', 'easy', 'target', 'men', 'are', 'surrounded', 'beast', 'not', 'canine', 'dog', 'animals', 'huge', 'bear', 'sized', 'wolves', 'one', 'fellow', 'survivors', 'Diaz', 'Frank', 'Grillo', 'fool', 'turned', 'sacrificial', 'lamb', 'screams', 'howling', 'packs', 'almost', 'losing', 'life', 'attack', 'yells', 'dark', 'eerie', 'night', ""'re"", 'not', 'animals', ""'re"", 'animals', 'proceeds', 'cut', 'dead', 'omega', 'wolfs', 'head', 'men', 'feast', 'carcass', 'intentionally', 'roast', 'eat', 'pack', 'see', 'dark', 'treeline', 'attempt', 'beginning', 'film', 'end', 'own', 'misery', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'reason', 'fate', 'opportunity', 'choose', 'being', 'sacrificial', 'lamb', 'alpha', 'male', 'not', 'one', 'last', 'fray', 'film', 'deals', 'mans', 'mortality', 'how', 'choose', 'do', 'not', 'choose', 'die', 'One', 'interesting', 'element', 'expressed', 'film', 'how', 'people', 'seem', 'see', 'loved', 'ones', 'death', 'approaches', 'form', 'spirits', 'memories', 'had', 'always', 'thought', 'be', 'Native', 'American', 'thing', 'evidently', 'cultures', 'fight', 'survival', 'films', 'theme', 'be', 'man', 'beast', 'sometimes', 'have', 'be', 'order', 'win', 'fight', 'like', 'wolves', 'men', 'are', 'alpha', 'omega', 'males']",The Grey

1490947,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAIIS0,Chris Kennison,"[1, 6]","""The Grey"" is the latest film from writer/director Joe Carnahan, who's previous outings all had a dark and moody feel to them, although this movie is a definitely a different turn for him. Most of his movies are set in urban environments, like ""Narc"", ""Smokin' Aces"" and ""Blood, Guts, Bullets & Octane"" and ""The Grey"" is far far far from anything urban.The movie is about an Alaskan oil drilling team that is on their way to a big job when their plane drops out of the sky and in the middle of a snowy tundra and there are only seven survivors. They are held prisoner by the elements and are forced to adapt to the very assurance that they will most likely die. They are led by a team sniper named Ottway, played by Liam Neeson, who is along for the trip because of his ability to shoot wolves and protect the workers. This is a skill that certainly comes in handy as they are greeted by a pack of wolves on night one.On top of dealing with bitter cold, wounds from the plane crash and knowing that they won't be found anytime soon, the wolves that don't eat but kill become an overwhelming obstacle. ""The Grey"" has a very dark overtone, as probably goes without saying. It is definitely a testosterone movie, filled with men being men and men figuring out ways to survive as long as they can.I would be amiss if I stated that the movie didn't hold my attention throughout, but there is much about ""The Grey"" that left me with a disappointing taste in my mouth. First of all, the movie plays out like a horror movie with its predictable one at a time story layout. There have been many movies similar to this in the past, like ""Alive"" and ""The Edge"" where a man had to survive a grizzly bear, and ""The Edge"" managed to hold you on the edge of your seat throughout. It was unpredictable and frightening. ""The Grey"" is very predictable and once you see the pattern, you know it doesn't get any better.The movie leaves you with a empty feeling as it explores life, religion, hope and death throughout. You get to know the men who are facing impossible odds and you root for them till the end. Yet, ""The Grey"" is what it is, a dark, moody, dreary story about living and dieing.",3,"One down, two down, three down horror movie pattern",1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,2173,"['Grey', 'latest', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'who', 'previous', 'outings', 'had', 'dark', 'moody', 'feel', 'movie', 'definitely', 'different', 'turn', 'Most', 'movies', 'are', 'set', 'urban', 'environments', 'Narc', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'Blood', 'Guts', 'Bullets', 'Octane', 'Grey', 'far', 'far', 'far', 'anything', 'urban.The', 'movie', 'Alaskan', 'oil', 'drilling', 'team', 'way', 'big', 'job', 'when', 'plane', 'sky', 'middle', 'snowy', 'tundra', 'are', 'only', 'seven', 'survivors', 'are', 'held', 'prisoner', 'elements', 'are', 'forced', 'adapt', 'very', 'assurance', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'die', 'are', 'led', 'team', 'sniper', 'named', 'Ottway', 'played', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'who', 'along', 'trip', 'ability', 'shoot', 'wolves', 'protect', 'workers', 'skill', 'certainly', 'handy', 'are', 'greeted', 'pack', 'wolves', 'night', 'one.On', 'top', 'dealing', 'bitter', 'cold', 'plane', 'crash', 'knowing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'anytime', 'soon', 'wolves', 'do', ""n't"", 'eat', 'kill', 'become', 'overwhelming', 'obstacle', 'Grey', 'very', 'dark', 'overtone', 'probably', 'saying', 'definitely', 'testosterone', 'movie', 'filled', 'men', 'being', 'men', 'men', 'figuring', 'out', 'ways', 'survive', 'as', 'long', 'can.I', 'would', 'be', 'amiss', 'stated', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'attention', 'much', 'Grey', 'left', 'disappointing', 'taste', 'mouth', 'First', 'all', 'movie', 'out', 'horror', 'movie', 'predictable', 'one', 'time', 'story', 'layout', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'movies', 'similar', 'past', 'Alive', 'Edge', 'where', 'man', 'had', 'survive', 'grizzly', 'bear', 'Edge', 'managed', 'hold', 'edge', 'seat', 'was', 'unpredictable', 'frightening', 'Grey', 'very', 'predictable', 'once', 'see', 'pattern', 'know', ""n't"", 'get', 'better.The', 'movie', 'empty', 'feeling', 'life', 'religion', 'hope', 'death', 'get', 'know', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'facing', 'impossible', 'odds', 'root', 'till', 'end', 'Grey', 'what', 'dark', 'moody', 'dreary', 'story', 'living', 'dieing']",The Grey

1490956,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIIS0,C. Sawin,"[188, 228]","There were a lot of things that felt like they were kept secret on purpose before sitting down and viewing The Grey for the first time. The trailer hints at the movie being nothing more than a survival thriller starring Liam Neeson as he struggles to survive not only the unrelenting cold elements, but also the ferocious wolves that inhabit his surroundings. The Grey is written and directed by Joe Carnahan, the man who brought us Smokin' Aces and The A-Team. The movie is also produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, which you think the marketing campaign would jump all over but doesn't even mention. Not only that, but there is quite a bit more to the movie than the trailer and TV spots let on.As the movie begins, Ottway (Liam Neeson) narrates a letter he's writing to his wife. This segment just made me realize what my life is lacking most right now and that's a Liam Neeson voiceover for every thought that crosses my mind. Think about that. It'd be the most amazing thing ever. The trailer reveals a few major things: that Ottway is stranded in the middle of nowhere in the blistering cold thanks to a plane crash and that wolves stand in the way of him actually surviving this ordeal. The plane crash itself is one of the best executed in recent memory. The way it's filmed and edited is downright ruthless. It's as if you're on the plane as it goes down. The Grey doesn't just place you in this blizzard-ridden hell infested with wolves, it kicks your teeth down your throat, laughs in your face, and throws you into it with everything it has.The movie gives new meaning to some of the simplest things. Seeing your breath in cold weather takes on an entirely new definition and the way The Grey deals with death just feels incredibly powerful. Ottway questions faith right from the start and takes matters into his own hands throughout the movie. The events that transpire take a toll on even the most religious plane crash survivors. Death is more of a relief than something worth distancing yourself from. Ottway describes it as being a warm sensation and thinking about the thing you love most in life before completely giving yourself into it. Many of the campfire conversations are entirely more impactful than they have any right to be. The conversation about faith in general hits you like a potato sack full of cinder blocks.The Grey manages to shout its message even when there's nothing being said on-screen. One of the images that stuck with me long after the movie ended was the shot of blood flowing into the paw print of a wolf in the snow. There's a scene by the river that strictly relies on sound and the way you succumb to it is nothing more than brilliant. There's another shot at the end of the film where (and I'm trying to avoid spoilers the best I can) Ottway is arranging some objects in the snow. The way Liam Neeson's fat, sausage-like fingers delicately wrap themselves around these objects and the way his hands tremble as he does this illustrates not only what this man has been through, but also that he's at the end of his rope. Plus the movie will make you want to look over your shoulder the next time you consider relieving yourself out in nature somewhere.That level of greatness The Grey eventually achieves isn't around at all times. Some lame dialogue does squeak through and characters manage to do really stupid things at times (John Diaz, played by Frank Grillo, especially), but that seems to help the movie more than anything. People, real people, occasionally do stupid things especially when they're scared. So this kind of made the characters feel more genuine and made it very clear that certain characters were caving under pressure.There was a movie that came out back in 2000 that was called Vertical Limit. It was one of my most trying times at the movie theater. I fought vehemently to leave about halfway through because I hated it so much, but I was with people at the time who wanted to stay until the end. It was probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had to pay for. The Grey is basically everything I wanted that movie to be. The cast is fantastic, their actions are mostly believable, and there's this meaning to everything that really speaks to you.The Grey is a grainy thriller that knocks the wind out of you on more than one occasion. In fact, it's rare that the movie actually allows you to catch your breath. Everything is such a raw, vicious, and brutal test of faith. It's fantastically violent and Liam Neeson is superb. If The Grey is anything to fall back on, then 2012 is going to be one hell of a year for movies.",4,Carnahan's best work to date?

1490962,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B005LAIIS0,DanD,"[2, 5]","If Hollywood has taught us anything, it's that you want Liam Neeson on your side in a tough situation.  The man can do anything: travel halfway across the world to rescue his daughter; train a Jedi master, a Sith lord, AND Batman; even lead a Scottish revolution.  What, you may be thinking, could a plane crash possibly do to Mr. Neeson?  Ruffle his hair?Indeed, Neeson and his fellow actors walk away from the plane crash...into the jaws of some very hungry, very demonic wolves.  Sound improbable?  It is.  And that's part of the fun.  Because THE GREY isn't an action film.  It was marketed as such, and as you can judge from many of the reviews, this was the viewpoint a lot of people took when watching it.  But THE GREY is more of an existential survivalist film.  These wolves aren't really wolves--they don't look like wolves, they don't behave like wolves.  The plane crash, beautiful though it is on film, isn't very realistic.  The fact that Neeson's character just happens to be a man paid to kill wolves?  Yeah.But Joe Carnahan does what most filmmakers wouldn't dare: he uses the absurdity to tell a bigger, more meaningful story.  Years from now, when people are debating whether or not Carnahan is a good filmmaker, the ""pro"" side will put forth THE GREY as their proof.  It is beautifully shot--the wolves are achingly rendered, shadowy creatures whose minimal appearance reflects the overall ambiguity of the film.  (Their attacks are effectively brutal while presenting a minimum level of gore.)  The afore-mentioned crash is stunning, and the various small action sequences are tightly drawn.  This is truly a film to be watched--the special effects, combined with the cinematography, and the actors' rugged appearances, makes it hard for one's eyes to wander.THE GREY isn't without its flaws.  It's slow in spots, and has a few weaker moments--hence the 4 stars.  But when it hits, it hits true, making it that rare film that defies expectations, bends genre conventions, and becomes something truly different.  An accidental hit, you might like to call it--or possibly the proof that there is a great filmmaker lurking within Joe Carnahan's imagination.",4,"A surprisingly deep, unnverving thriller.",1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,2176,"['Hollywood', 'taught', 'anything', 'want', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'side', 'tough', 'situation', 'man', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'travel', 'halfway', 'world', 'rescue', 'daughter', 'train', 'Jedi', 'master', 'Sith', 'lord', 'AND', 'Batman', 'even', 'lead', 'Scottish', 'revolution', 'What', 'may', 'be', 'thinking', 'could', 'plane', 'crash', 'possibly', 'do', 'Mr.', 'Neeson', 'Ruffle', 'hair', 'Indeed', 'Neeson', 'fellow', 'actors', 'walk', 'away', 'plane', 'crash', 'jaws', 'very', 'hungry', 'very', 'demonic', 'wolves', 'Sound', 'improbable', 'part', 'fun', 'THE', 'GREY', ""n't"", 'action', 'film', 'was', 'marketed', 'such', 'can', 'judge', 'many', 'reviews', 'was', 'viewpoint', 'lot', 'people', 'took', 'when', 'watching', 'THE', 'GREY', 'more', 'existential', 'survivalist', 'film', 'wolves', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'wolves', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'wolves', 'do', ""n't"", 'behave', 'wolves', 'plane', 'crash', 'beautiful', 'film', ""n't"", 'very', 'realistic', 'fact', 'Neeson', 'character', 'just', 'be', 'man', 'paid', 'kill', 'wolves', 'Yeah.But', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'what', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'would', ""n't"", 'dare', 'absurdity', 'tell', 'bigger', 'more', 'meaningful', 'story', 'Years', 'now', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'debating', 'not', 'Carnahan', 'good', 'filmmaker', 'pro', 'side', 'will', 'put', 'forth', 'THE', 'GREY', 'proof', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'wolves', 'are', 'achingly', 'rendered', 'shadowy', 'creatures', 'minimal', 'appearance', 'overall', 'ambiguity', 'film', 'attacks', 'are', 'effectively', 'brutal', 'presenting', 'minimum', 'level', 'gore', 'afore-mentioned', 'crash', 'stunning', 'various', 'small', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'tightly', 'drawn', 'truly', 'film', 'be', 'watched', 'special', 'effects', 'combined', 'cinematography', 'actors', 'rugged', 'appearances', 'hard', 'one', 'eyes', 'wander.THE', 'GREY', ""n't"", 'flaws', 'slow', 'spots', 'few', 'weaker', 'moments', 'hence', '4', 'stars', 'when', 'true', 'making', 'rare', 'film', 'expectations', 'bends', 'genre', 'conventions', 'something', 'truly', 'different', 'accidental', 'hit', 'might', 'like', 'call', 'possibly', 'proof', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'lurking', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'imagination']",The Grey

It is, by far, the best film I have seen in a very long time.  It is truly, as Mr. Neeson puts it, about ""Men, unfit for mankind"" against mother nature in all of her absolute fury, but most of all it is a pulse pounding and riveting exploration of loss and real courage, and faith, and how real men face almost insurmountable odds, and how men, in the worst of circumstances treat and regard their fellow man.  I was devastated by ""the Grey"" in all of its ferocious and poetic power.First, the acting was astounding.  From Mr. Liam Neeson (who is in my mind a bona fide action star with incredible acting ability) to Frank Grillo, and Dermot Mulrooney, and the rest of the cast, the acting was the best I have seen in ages.  The acting seemed so natural, and truly imitated the way real people, especially men, actually relate to each other. it is probably the first time I have ever actually seen it captured so well and naturally on film.The cinematography, and the story were excellent.  The movie is grim, ultra violent, dark, but it is also an incredibly deft and soul wrenching journey into what it means to be a man and have real courage in the face of almost certain death?  It asks, how would I treat my fellow man in the worst hell the cosmos can conjure up? The Grey is also a film about and of faith, and of loss, and not just the loss that is depicted on film, but the silent loss and pain that so many men (maybe all men) have and go through in their lives and carry with them (whether it be self destructive in origin, or bad luck, or loss of loved ones, or what ever form it takes). The Grey is brilliant on both a physical and metaphorical level.Truthfully, I was devastated by this film, and any time a character died, I felt each death so intensely (I looked around and there were grown men in the theater sobbing silently).  Anytime a character revealed himself, in terms of his life and his view/faith, his own loss, I was transfixed.  Some of these characters were seemingly rotten scoundrels, but ultimately I grew to give a damn about them, and their plight, and that. in my opinion, is the brilliance of ""the Grey"".  These men were revealed ultimately to be not scoundrels who were at their core bad men, but men, who had made too many mistakes, like so many of us, and just couldn't get their lives kick started out of the hurricane that consumes so many lost souls.  As a man viewing this, it struck me as an incredibly deep study of the true heart of man.  I felt that any one of these fellows could have been me or one of my friends out there.  I did not want in any moment, for any one of these characters to die.  I said to myself, I am watching a movie, a work of fiction, but am reacting like what was on screen was something real.  It felt that way to me.  And I can give ""the Grey"" no greater praise.  For example, when I learned towards the end, why Liam Neeson was so pained in his soul, it had a huge emotional impact on me.  A real and quiet impact.  I said to myself, this is the way that I would be if I experienced this, I think, although who can know until you go through something like that.Other reviewers here have briefly summarized the plot far better than I could, and I would say that on its surface it is an extremely well told survival tale... extremely intense and violent, with 7 men trying to escape a ravenous pack of wolves hell bent on punishing them physically and metaphorically, but what is interesting is that the rest of mother nature nature was just as, if not more, brutal towards these souls as the wolves were.  It is almost as if the wolves could have been an afterthought to mother nature's fury and rage.For me, the Grey was not just a film, but an experience. If you are a deep thinking man or person, I believe that The Grey will be an experience for you to savor.  It is also a hell of an exciting movie, but I was so plugged in, that the excitement was just an after thought for me against the emotional intensity of this cinematic masterpiece.  Joe Carnahan, Liam Neeson, and all of you who made this happen, I say bravo to you, and tip my cup and hat to the masterpiece you have put on the screen.  Thank you.  Thank you.I have read some reviewers complaining about the ending, and I have to say to them, ""Are you kidding me?""  It is the right ending.  Make sure you stay till the end of the credits and you will learn what happened.  Anyone who doesn't like the ending, I truly believe misses the point... of what the Grey is saying.  thank you for reading.P.S. I am absolutely interested in hearing other people's thoughts.

Liam Neeson as usual was intense and is a pleasure to watch generally.  Unfortunately, as many reviewers have noted, there are some glaring inconsistencies and not quite believeable situations that kept me distracted from the story line. These seemly minor incongruities do make a difference.  The movie had promise and I felt could have been a lot better without them. First of all, I was amazed, as has been mentioned in a prior review, that after double belting himself across his seat, Neeson wakes up laying in the snow quite a distance from the wreckage? And apparently uninjured!  He hasn't a scrath on him, but when he finds his rifle, still in its case, it is apparently broken and unsuable?  It is mentioned in the movie that they hit the ground going 400 mph. Now this may have been a guess on the speaker's part, but for only several of them to survive suggests quite a crash, and then these survivors were walking without so much as a limp or broken limb (except one other who dies shortly after the crash due to bleeding)? Then there is the letter, which he apparently put in his pocket before the crash, and then finds it near the seat he occupied previously, after the crash? And where were the cell phones?  I assumed the movie was contemporary. Maybe that far out in Alaska there would be no signal.  But these men didn't really know how far they flew before the crash.  Not a single one pulls out a phone to see if there was signal? Did I miss something? And the wind chill factor. Would they really be able to walk several miles thru deep snow with no face mask or gloves in winds that would easily produce subzero temperatures?  Were they really safer walking out in the open from the wolves, with no serious weapons save a couple knives, rather than barricading themselves in the wreckage, where with plenty of water from snow they could survive a week easily?  And then after successfully killing a wolf using a stick with a bullet on the end, you see them in the woods, each carrying a torch, but not a single one carry one of those sticks? You can bet I would be carrying a stick fashioned into a spear or with a bullet on the end!  Obviously, to have a survival type plot, you can't have cell phones work, or have a rifle intact with ammunition ready to go, but there surely would be a way to make their situation more believeable so it doesn't distract from the point of the movie.",3,Inconsistencies Distract from the Plot and Acting,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,2607,"['Having', 'read', 'many', 'reviews', 'agree', 'higher', 'rated', 'reviews', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'born', 'intense', 'fear', 'extreme', 'situation', 'faced', 'men', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'usual', 'was', 'intense', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'generally', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'are', 'glaring', 'inconsistencies', 'not', 'quite', 'believeable', 'situations', 'kept', 'distracted', 'story', 'line', 'seemly', 'minor', 'incongruities', 'do', 'make', 'difference', 'movie', 'had', 'promise', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'First', 'was', 'amazed', 'been', 'mentioned', 'prior', 'review', 'double', 'belting', 'seat', 'Neeson', 'up', 'laying', 'snow', 'quite', 'distance', 'wreckage', 'apparently', 'uninjured', ""n't"", 'scrath', 'when', 'rifle', 'still', 'case', 'apparently', 'broken', 'unsuable', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'hit', 'ground', 'going', '400', 'mph', 'Now', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'guess', 'speaker', 'part', 'only', 'several', 'survive', 'suggests', 'quite', 'crash', 'then', 'survivors', 'were', 'walking', 'so', 'much', 'limp', 'broken', 'limb', 'one', 'other', 'who', 'shortly', 'crash', 'due', 'bleeding', 'Then', 'letter', 'apparently', 'put', 'pocket', 'crash', 'then', 'seat', 'occupied', 'previously', 'crash', 'where', 'were', 'cell', 'phones', 'assumed', 'movie', 'was', 'contemporary', 'Maybe', 'far', 'out', 'Alaska', 'would', 'be', 'signal', 'men', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'far', 'flew', 'crash', 'Not', 'single', 'one', 'out', 'phone', 'see', 'was', 'signal', 'Did', 'miss', 'something', 'wind', 'chill', 'factor', 'Would', 'really', 'be', 'able', 'walk', 'several', 'miles', 'thru', 'deep', 'snow', 'face', 'mask', 'gloves', 'winds', 'would', 'easily', 'produce', 'subzero', 'temperatures', 'Were', 'really', 'safer', 'walking', 'out', 'open', 'wolves', 'serious', 'weapons', 'save', 'couple', 'rather', 'barricading', 'wreckage', 'where', 'plenty', 'water', 'snow', 'could', 'survive', 'week', 'easily', 'then', 'successfully', 'killing', 'wolf', 'using', 'stick', 'bullet', 'end', 'see', 'woods', 'carrying', 'torch', 'not', 'single', 'one', 'carry', 'one', 'sticks', 'can', 'bet', 'would', 'be', 'carrying', 'stick', 'fashioned', 'spear', 'bullet', 'end', 'Obviously', 'have', 'survival', 'type', 'plot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'cell', 'phones', 'work', 'have', 'rifle', 'intact', 'ammunition', 'ready', 'go', 'there', 'surely', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'make', 'situation', 'more', 'believeable', ""n't"", 'distract', 'point', 'movie']",The Grey

Nesson gives a commendable performance as professional wolf killer Ottway. Even though we don't know either of them well enough for it to be really meaningful, the way his estranged wife acts as a guardian angel to him is an interesting conceit. Realistic oil roughneck acting and dialogue despite the fact that most of the supporting characters tend to run together and, plane crash notwithstanding, seldom complete a sentence without two or three f-bombs.This film is undeniably realistic in many ways; in many others, it's very unconvincing. It's tense and compelling thanks mostly to fine camera work and stage directions, but there are a number of annoying short-cuts and cop-outs. The best aspect of THE GREY is its forbiddingly beautiful Alaskan scenery--the cinematography really outshines the plot. Though I didn't care much for the ending, I have to say that it is both surprising and fitting for this film's whole Hemingwayesque tone and atmosphere (humankind against the dispassionate wild and all that sort of stuff).

An epic is a story that defines an entire genre as it should be, giving way to non-stop character development and a conflict that is either unresolved or is just resolved for the main character(s). An epic is a story with such a deep meaning and deliverance that it can go down in the history books for being life-changing or truly open minded. Examples of these are Gladiator, The Iliad, Saving Private Ryan, and Blade Runner; historical and science fiction epics. Now, there is the survival epic; The Grey. Starring Liam Neeson, this story about human courage and endurance is a simple, yet complex tale; the performances by every actor in the film are just stunning, believable every second of the time. The direction and pacing of the action scenes and in-depth storytelling was some of the best work i've ever seen; it's what you'd expect if Ridley AND Tony Scott were both producers of this film. Their presence just tells you that this will be epic in some way, shape or form, and it is. In a solid 117 minutes, this film dives head-first into a pool of our worst fears and comes out an emotional masterpiece with a deep meaning and an epic conclusion that makes you see how valuable life really is. Some people say the ending was stupid, pointless or unnecessary, but when you watch it, pay attention to Ottway's father's poem and recognize the events that happened on the way to where he ended up; this film truly is a survival epic.""Once more into the fray, into the last good fight I'll ever know.

Although in our time and culture, we think of fairy tales as being suitable reading for children, in their original forms, many of these stories are dark and deal with the extremes of philosophical analysis of existence and its purpose.The actions taken by the characters in the film are certainly not the choices I would have made; but they are the kinds of choices that characters in fairy tales make, in order to resolve their real problems, and confront their real monsters.  Those who were displeased with this film based on its illogic in a real sense may have missed the point and the heart of what was being done here.  Granted, it's an odd film, and irrationality is confrontational to those who are sitting in nice, warm, comfy places, free to orchestrate from their recliners.

1491006,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B005LAIIS0,Ian,"[2, 6]","Survival movies seem to be pretty rare these days, which makes each new one a treat to see, especially when they feature grade A stars (Liam Neeson in this instance) taking on the title theme monster or element (in this case, vicious wolves).  And while the film may veer into some cliches we've seen many times before, it manages to be an effective thriller that grips you until the very end.""The Grey"" follows Ottway, a hunter tasked with keeping Alaskan pipeline workers safe from hostile wildlife.  It's a lonely, hard job, and things only get worse, for while flying out to another job, Ottway is caught up in a plane crash that leaves him and a few other survivors deep in the frozen heart of Alaska.  Now he must rally the others, and fight to survive not only the elements, but a pack of wolves hell-bent on taking them out as well.What struck me most about ""The Grey"" is how grim it is.  This isn't an uplifting story of people banding together to overcome adversity; this is a film about desperate men out of their element, where death can strike at any time, and they're the ones at the bottom of the food chain.  And while it seems to make for a very despair-filled film, it works.  You're sucked into a situation that feels completely real, from the bare minimum use of CGI (when Neeson is freezing out in the snow-filled plains, it's real, and not a studio), to the danger of the ever-present wolves, and the way the survivors react.  In fact, a nice surprise of the film is the little character moments that pop up throughout the film, such as a hate-filled rant against God, to a moving scene at the side of a river that I won't ruin here.  Neeson himself turns in a fantastic performance of a world-weary man who is forced to take charge of a bad situation, with only his knowledge of the wild to help him.  He's not an action hero, or a macho-body builder, but an ordinary, middle-aged man who's tired of life, and it works wonderfully.But while ""The Grey"" works very well on all fronts, it does fall into the standard cliche of ""picking off the survivors one by one,"" which leads the viewer to wonder if the film will defy the stereotype of having one lone survivor by the end of the film.  In addition, it's disappointing that, for having such a strong and gripping story, the film has a very weak ending that made me feel cheated.Still, despite it's two flaws, ""The Grey"" is a gripping survival film that feels completely realistic in every way: not once are you asked to suspend your disbelief, because the need never arises.  The characters are strong and believable, and the film has a visceral punch that grabs hold, and doesn't let go.  For fans of survival films, ""The Grey"" comes highly recommended.Oh, and one last thing: be sure to stay through the credits, as there's a scene afterwards.",4,"Like Jaws, but with wolves, and in a forest",1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,2818,"['Survival', 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'pretty', 'rare', 'days', 'new', 'one', 'treat', 'see', 'especially', 'when', 'feature', 'grade', 'stars', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'instance', 'taking', 'title', 'theme', 'monster', 'element', 'case', 'vicious', 'wolves', 'film', 'may', 'veer', 'cliches', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'be', 'effective', 'thriller', 'very', 'end', 'Grey', 'Ottway', 'hunter', 'tasked', 'keeping', 'Alaskan', 'pipeline', 'workers', 'safe', 'hostile', 'wildlife', 'lonely', 'hard', 'job', 'things', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'flying', 'out', 'job', 'Ottway', 'caught', 'up', 'plane', 'crash', 'few', 'other', 'survivors', 'deep', 'frozen', 'heart', 'Alaska', 'Now', 'must', 'rally', 'others', 'fight', 'survive', 'not', 'only', 'elements', 'pack', 'wolves', 'hell-bent', 'taking', 'out', 'well.What', 'struck', 'most', 'Grey', 'how', 'grim', ""n't"", 'uplifting', 'story', 'people', 'banding', 'together', 'overcome', 'adversity', 'film', 'desperate', 'men', 'element', 'where', 'death', 'can', 'strike', 'time', ""'re"", 'ones', 'bottom', 'food', 'chain', 'make', 'very', 'despair-filled', 'film', ""'re"", 'sucked', 'situation', 'completely', 'real', 'bare', 'minimum', 'use', 'CGI', 'when', 'Neeson', 'freezing', 'out', 'snow-filled', 'plains', 'real', 'not', 'studio', 'danger', 'ever-present', 'wolves', 'way', 'survivors', 'react', 'fact', 'nice', 'surprise', 'film', 'little', 'character', 'moments', 'pop', 'up', 'film', 'such', 'hate-filled', 'rant', 'God', 'moving', 'scene', 'side', 'river', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'here', 'Neeson', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'world-weary', 'man', 'who', 'forced', 'take', 'charge', 'bad', 'situation', 'only', 'knowledge', 'wild', 'help', 'not', 'action', 'hero', 'macho-body', 'builder', 'ordinary', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'who', 'tired', 'life', 'wonderfully.But', 'Grey', 'very', 'well', 'fronts', 'fall', 'standard', 'cliche', 'picking', 'off', 'survivors', 'one', 'one', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'film', 'will', 'defy', 'stereotype', 'having', 'one', 'lone', 'survivor', 'end', 'film', 'addition', 'disappointing', 'having', 'strong', 'gripping', 'story', 'film', 'very', 'weak', 'ending', 'made', 'feel', 'cheated.Still', 'two', 'flaws', 'Grey', 'gripping', 'survival', 'film', 'completely', 'realistic', 'way', 'not', 'once', 'are', 'asked', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'need', 'never', 'characters', 'are', 'strong', 'believable', 'film', 'visceral', 'punch', 'hold', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'fans', 'survival', 'films', 'Grey', 'highly', 'recommended.Oh', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'be', 'sure', 'stay', 'credits', 'scene', 'afterwards']",The Grey

1491016,A1V3TRGWOMA8LC,B005LAIIS0,"James Beswick ""Thanks for your time""","[129, 170]","The basic problem of The Grey is the difference between what the filmmakers think they had and what the marketing department wanted to sell. This is promoted as a dramatic survival action movie in the trailers and even Liam Neeson's talk-show circuit tour pushed the same line - a plane crashes and a bunch of guys have to survive things that want to eat them. Kind of 'Alive' meets Jurassic Park. With Ra's al Ghul.Unfortunately, it's this difference that's going to disappoint most of the audience. The film starts with Liam's melancholic voice-over (which isn't a good sign) and a fairly dim setup of oil-riggers beating the ever-loving out of each other. We then see Liam shooting a wolf, lamenting the loss of his wife and then putting a rifle in his mouth and contemplating sparing us from another 2 hours of this. And it gets more depressing from there when the trip home ends abruptly in a plane crash.It's at this point that the film's indecision about what it is becomes a real problem. As an action or survival film, Liam guides his band of survivors in the most irresponsible way possible, making mistake after mistake and fundamentally dooming them all to becoming wolf entree. There are some basic errors, such as a stack of shotgun shells packed with his rifle, and anybody who's familiar with wolf behavior is going to be really unhappy at their depiction in this film. Anyone from Alaska is going to be even more unhappy at the depiction of swimming in rapids too.Also as an action film, the wolves have a supernatural capability to outsmart the survivors and behave more like Spielberg's raptors than any real life wolf. At one point they jump a ravine and the wolfs are waiting with GPS precision. They pick off our band of survivors one at a time, leaving us with intermittent testosterone-fueled in-fighting to pass as drama. If only Liam hadn't left the crash site, where rescue teams would already have arrived with burgers and cocoa.But here's the problem - it's not an action film. It's not a survival film either. It's a psychological drama about facing death where the wolves act as furry metaphors for the grim reaper. From the very first scene to the last, Liam Neeson (who's very good as always) emphasizes this theme and it reverberates over and over. And that's where the film could have been quite good and a welcome break from the survival genre but unfortunately it's too late by the time it becomes clear that the wolves' uncanny supernatural sense has a very good explanation.My guess is that the everyone expecting an action drama is going to be very unhappy, along with animal rights, PETA, Alaskans and oil-riggers. It's a real shame they didn't recut the trailer before the release.",3,A wolf in sheep's clothing,1337472000,"05 20, 2012",2012,2723,"['basic', 'problem', 'Grey', 'difference', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'think', 'had', 'what', 'marketing', 'department', 'wanted', 'sell', 'promoted', 'dramatic', 'survival', 'action', 'movie', 'trailers', 'even', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'talk-show', 'circuit', 'tour', 'pushed', 'same', 'line', 'plane', 'crashes', 'bunch', 'guys', 'have', 'survive', 'things', 'want', 'eat', 'Kind', ""'Alive"", 'meets', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Ra', 'al', 'Ghul.Unfortunately', 'difference', 'going', 'disappoint', 'most', 'audience', 'film', 'Liam', 'melancholic', 'voice-over', ""n't"", 'good', 'sign', 'fairly', 'dim', 'setup', 'oil-riggers', 'beating', 'ever-loving', 'other', 'then', 'see', 'Liam', 'shooting', 'wolf', 'lamenting', 'loss', 'wife', 'then', 'putting', 'rifle', 'mouth', 'contemplating', 'sparing', '2', 'hours', 'more', 'depressing', 'there', 'when', 'trip', 'home', 'abruptly', 'plane', 'crash.It', 'point', 'film', 'indecision', 'what', 'real', 'problem', 'action', 'survival', 'film', 'Liam', 'band', 'survivors', 'most', 'irresponsible', 'way', 'possible', 'making', 'mistake', 'mistake', 'fundamentally', 'dooming', 'becoming', 'wolf', 'entree', 'are', 'basic', 'errors', 'such', 'stack', 'shotgun', 'shells', 'packed', 'rifle', 'anybody', 'who', 'familiar', 'wolf', 'behavior', 'going', 'be', 'really', 'unhappy', 'depiction', 'film', 'Anyone', 'Alaska', 'going', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'unhappy', 'depiction', 'swimming', 'rapids', 'too.Also', 'action', 'film', 'wolves', 'have', 'supernatural', 'capability', 'outsmart', 'survivors', 'behave', 'more', 'Spielberg', 'raptors', 'real', 'life', 'wolf', 'one', 'point', 'jump', 'ravine', 'wolfs', 'are', 'waiting', 'GPS', 'precision', 'pick', 'off', 'band', 'survivors', 'one', 'time', 'leaving', 'intermittent', 'testosterone-fueled', 'in-fighting', 'pass', 'drama', 'only', 'Liam', 'had', ""n't"", 'left', 'crash', 'site', 'where', 'rescue', 'teams', 'would', 'already', 'have', 'arrived', 'burgers', 'cocoa.But', 'here', 'problem', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'survival', 'film', 'psychological', 'drama', 'facing', 'death', 'where', 'wolves', 'act', 'furry', 'metaphors', 'grim', 'reaper', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'who', 'very', 'good', 'always', 'theme', 'where', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'good', 'welcome', 'break', 'survival', 'genre', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'late', 'time', 'clear', 'wolves', 'uncanny', 'supernatural', 'sense', 'very', 'good', 'explanation.My', 'guess', 'everyone', 'expecting', 'action', 'drama', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'unhappy', 'animal', 'rights', 'PETA', 'Alaskans', 'oil-riggers', 'real', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'recut', 'trailer', 'release']",The Grey

1491018,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005LAIIS0,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[4, 6]","Director Joe Carnahan made such a promising and exciting start in the feature film business with the 70's crime drama throwback NARC. It was strong, exciting and a shot in the arm to a tiring genre. He followed that up with the bizarre yet oddly entertaining ensemble actioner SMOKING ACES, but once locked into the Hollywood machine, he did the unnecessary but not-too-terrible film version of the 80's TV show THE A-TEAM, which teamed him for the first time with strong dramatic actor who became rebranded as action star Liam Neeson. This somehow led to THE GREY, a film that is not the survival adventure promised in the previews. THE GREY is an occasionally thoughtful, extremely existental, and ultimately predictible Man Versus Nature drama.We have John Ottway (Neeson, finally being allowed to speak in his natural accent), a gruff and suicidally depressed ""exterminator"" of sorts who works on an oil-drilling site in Alaska. His job essentially consists of picking off nasty man-eating wolves that look to use the workers as kibble with his rifle. He ponders poetically about his wife and how he misses her and how he knows he'll never be with her again. The other workers are, for the most part, societal outcasts; they're ex-cons, drifters, quick to anger and violence, meaning that Ottway is right at home with them. But it's time for them to go home, so they catch a plane back to Anchorage. There are warnings of a storm, or as co-writers Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers (who wrote the short story this film is based on) call it, foreshadowing. The plane naturally crashes (in an uncomfortably effective set piece) and Ottway finds himself taking charge of a ragged and motley crew of survivors and look to stay alive amongst the harsh weather of the Alaska's snowy wastelands. Before too long, it seems that Ottway's work has followed him to the crash site as they soon find themselves surrounded by a pack of vicious ravening wolves. So instead of this being a story about men coming together and fighting the elements, it becomes something of a horror film as the men begin getting picked off one by one as Ottway tries to lead them to safety.Despite the film's massive leaps of logic and sense in order to manufacture forward momentum, it's an interesting film to watch. Carnahan does a commendable job of showing the brutal and unforgiving climate and also shows some beautiful vistas of the Alaskan wilderness. He's also pretty good at creating suspense, but it's really just enough to keep you watching despite knowing just about everything that's going to happen. You know that the film will become allegorical at one point for the behavior of the animals and the behavior of the men. You know there will be someone that will eventually challenge Ottway's ""alpha"" status, and that comes in the form of Diaz (the most interesting character of the film as played by a very volatile Frank Grillo, a great character actor). The whole cast of survivors, including Dallas Roberts and a very unrecognizable Dermot Mulroney, essentially seem to be analogues of the cast of John Carpenter's arctic existential horror masterpiece THE THING, but even that's not a terribly new idea. Survival thrillers often have the same archetypal characters. The film also delves into the nature of humanity's faith and the existence of a higher power, and this is where the film succeeds at being surprising yet unnecessarily ham-fisted as it becomes the love-child of Jack London and Samuel Beckett by way of Carnahan's profanity-and-gore-laden narrative. Neeson does nice work here and it further cements his current bad-ass status, but this is not even as interesting or as memorable of a role as Bryan Mills in TAKEN.Where I think the biggest disconnect is between audiences and this film is, exists in the realm of its marketing. This film promises certain things in the trailers and the commercials but doesn't live up to them, and the most glaring example of that is in the film's climax which is the very end of the film. While the moment promised to us is hardly the point of the film, it's something that everyone wanted to see, and when that was taken away from us, we felt cheated. There's truth to that. Most of the negative reviews specifically have to do with the film's ending and how it didn't live up to some very specific expectations, and that's more to do with the marketing than the film, because this is a film where the narrative isn't dependent on a climactic showdown between Ottway and the wolves; it's a more contemplative film than that. So I just don't think that we can blame Carnahan for the ending not meeting those expectations; Universal wanted to get butts in seats and what better way to do that with a film like this than the promise of Liam Neeson taping broken glass to his fists to do battle with a wolf?One way or the other, the biggest problem with THE GREY is that it attempts to be a thought-provoking piece of the existental crisis of Man Versus Nature, but because it's more structured like a survival horror film, it ends up not being terribly successful in either way.3/5 Stars.",3,Thoughtful yet predictable

1491025,AWN6ZMWWMUWLX,B005LAIIS0,J. Friday,"[2, 4]","I'll make my review brief. It has good cinematography. I liked the bleak, moody atmosphere of the gorgeous British Columbian wilderness (the movie was set in Alaska, shot in British Columbia). I liked the fact that it was a natural horror movie (natural horror is where animals are antagonists, like Jaws or Orca); too many supernatural horror movies. I liked the fact that it was all men. More horror movies need to show all men. The original The Thing did an excellent job of showing a horror movie with only men can be suspenseful and frightening. Too many horror movies rely on pretty blondes just to get the scares going. This movie wasn't as cliched as most horror movies. So I respected it's devotion to being original. In an age where 90% of the movies from Hollywood are remakes, we definitely need original ideas. I'm so exasperated by remakes I'd rather see a flawed original movie than a remake. I also liked the plane crash scene. It actually made me tense.The flaw: bad characterization. I couldn't feel sorry for anyone in this movie. I couldn't put my finger on it, but the characters seemed like cardboard stock characters than real people. As a result, the movie left me neutral. All in all, I'd recommend renting it. Some people may like this movie. I know many didn't care for it. Just rent it to test the waters if you're curious about this flick. The fans of this movie have been very personal. I've read them arguing with people on imdb.com about this movie for months. I've seen them cursing at the haters and getting cursed at back. That's been the most enjoyable part of this movie. It's good when a movie starts a heated debate. It's especially telling when the debates of the flick are more interesting than the flick itself.SPOILERSPlus, I had a nitpick about the cold. I don't know where the screenwriter grew up, but apparently the director spent some of his childhood in Michigan and Northern California. So why was his depiction of people in winter so unrealistic? The weather is 0 degrees. Yet most of the time you couldn't see their breath like you would at that temp. They slept without their hats or gloves on and with only one small blanket. If you're in 0 degree weather, you're going to bundle up like mad.

Despite the premise of The Grey, wolves are generally not dangerous to humans.Having said that there have been incidents where wolves got used to seeing humans, and would single out certain folks, even able to tell if the human was armed or not. In those cases they usually go for the head or neck area, or an area close to an artery.The Grey tells a story of survival after a handful of oil-men are stranded from a plane crash in the brutal Alaskan wilderness.It was supposed to be John Ottway's (Liam Neeson) last day on the job. We find him writing a letter to his wife, telling her that he plans to commit suicide. He's interrupted by the howl of a wolf. He kills the creature. That's his job to keep the predators away from the oil-men.After the crash, he and a small group of men rush to a forest line, set up camp and build a fire. It's clear the wolves have tracked the men and surrounded them. Hypothermia is setting in. The men share personal thoughts and stories around the fire to keep their minds off the danger. When John gets a turn he recites a poem that he remembers hanging over his Father's desk, ""Once more into the fray, Into the last good fight I'll ever know, Live and die on this day, Live and die on this day.""One by one the men succumb to the harsh environment, the fierce cold and the deadly wolves.This is one of the best survival films to come along in awhile.",4,"Once more into the fray, live and die on this day",1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,1518,"['Jim', 'Clark', 'publisher', 'Lee', 'County', 'Courier', 'Tupelo', 'MSIn', 'Norse', 'Viking', 'mythology', 'wolf', 'took', 'almost', 'god-like', 'persona', 'premise', 'Grey', 'wolves', 'are', 'generally', 'not', 'dangerous', 'humans.Having', 'said', 'have', 'been', 'incidents', 'where', 'wolves', 'got', 'used', 'seeing', 'humans', 'would', 'single', 'out', 'certain', 'folks', 'even', 'able', 'tell', 'human', 'was', 'armed', 'not', 'cases', 'usually', 'go', 'head', 'neck', 'area', 'area', 'close', 'artery.The', 'Grey', 'story', 'survival', 'handful', 'oil-men', 'are', 'stranded', 'plane', 'crash', 'brutal', 'Alaskan', 'wilderness.It', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'John', 'Ottway', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'last', 'day', 'job', 'find', 'writing', 'letter', 'wife', 'telling', 'commit', 'suicide', 'interrupted', 'howl', 'wolf', 'creature', 'job', 'keep', 'predators', 'away', 'oil-men.After', 'crash', 'small', 'group', 'men', 'rush', 'forest', 'line', 'set', 'up', 'camp', 'build', 'fire', 'clear', 'wolves', 'have', 'tracked', 'men', 'surrounded', 'Hypothermia', 'setting', 'men', 'share', 'personal', 'thoughts', 'stories', 'fire', 'keep', 'minds', 'danger', 'When', 'John', 'turn', 'poem', 'hanging', 'Father', 'desk', 'Once', 'more', 'fray', 'Into', 'last', 'good', 'fight', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'know', 'Live', 'die', 'day', 'Live', 'die', 'day', 'One', 'one', 'men', 'succumb', 'harsh', 'environment', 'fierce', 'cold', 'deadly', 'wolves.This', 'one', 'best', 'survival', 'films', 'come', 'along', 'awhile']",The Grey

The Grey has a simple story but also goes deeper into the characters; for example, John Ottway (Liam Neeson) often questions life and has lost faith, and some of the audience may be appreciate the attempt to create deep characters. The movie has plenty of thrills, including many chase scenes with packs of wolves. Some of the thrills also come from the environment and the survival. Also, I thought the music was amazing and the film was shot beautifully; the acting was also great. It does get a bit repetitive, though, which may be because of the 1hr 50min runtime; it doesn't have as much variety as it could've had and does feel like it drags on.Overall, I highly recommend The Grey.

He pens a letter to his wife, then gets on a plane, which crashes and he ends up in the wilderness with other men fighting for his life and the lives around him.Liam Nesson is one of the older generation's overlooked actors. He is an actor that can take on any role and nail it. He is so method and so intense in his acting ability, he can carry any film that he is in with it. He is remarkable to watch and makes me actually want to go to see the film that he potentially is in.  But in this film, he could've turned in a one-note performance and just chewed scenery, but he turns in a haunting, moving performance that made me weep for his character towards the end.  You get that feeling in your gut after watching the men walk through the wilderness and you just know. Also you feel for the character after getting to know him through out the movie.  Not a lot of actors have that hold on the audience like he does.Joe Carnahan is a pretty prolific director that has his hits (Smoking Aces), huge misses (A Team) and critically overlooked (Narc). I was worried that he would underwhelm yet again on this one because A Team didn't come out that great and I was disappointed, but I was glad I saw this movie because this movie takes the talent he has shown in Narc and brings it to a another level of solid film-making. The look, pace of the film are really good and made me enjoy the movie even more because with certain directors the material in this film would've or could've been mishandled, but he did it fine. In fact, this could be his masterpiece because it moved me to the point because at the point before I saw it, I had low expectations. I am glad it didn't turn out to be the ACTION FEST TO END ALL ACTION FEST movie the trailer made it out to be.  Everything is just well rounded here, but it does have its flaws.First flaw is that the side characters that worked with Nesson's character barely had time to get their story. I know there is a 2-hour time limit and there could've been more expanded from the story on those characters because in the last scene, I really didn't feel for them as much as I did Nesson's character because that is basically the main character development that we had in the movie, but the rest not so much.Yes, I did read there was a lack of an ending, but how do you end a movie like this? It's hard to sit at your computer and go, ""Ok, let's end it this way or that way."" That's not how it works. Some open endings are perfect for some movies, and this movie had a good open ending to make you think on what was going to happen to the character after the film ended.  Plus, I feel some other reviewers missed the theme and the message of the movie to the point where they are making blind criticisms without digesting the film, but you don't have to like everything.Overall, it was a enjoyable movie and a great thrill ride like the reviews said it was, it had the right amounts of all the stuff that movies are made up of, but there was a lack of some parts that didn't make the movie less enjoyable, but still were there to see.",4,Nesson carries a emotional gut punch of a movie.,1327795200,"01 29, 2012",2012,3197,"['GreyReviewA', 'man', 'named', 'John', 'Otway', 'Alaskan', 'Wilderness', 'protector', 'oil', 'drilling', 'team', 'Wolves', 'letter', 'wife', 'then', 'plane', 'crashes', 'up', 'wilderness', 'other', 'men', 'fighting', 'life', 'lives', 'him.Liam', 'Nesson', 'one', 'older', 'generation', 'overlooked', 'actors', 'actor', 'can', 'take', 'role', 'nail', 'so', 'method', 'so', 'intense', 'acting', 'ability', 'can', 'carry', 'film', 'remarkable', 'watch', 'actually', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'potentially', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'one-note', 'performance', 'just', 'chewed', 'scenery', 'haunting', 'moving', 'performance', 'made', 'weep', 'character', 'end', 'get', 'feeling', 'gut', 'watching', 'men', 'walk', 'wilderness', 'just', 'know', 'Also', 'feel', 'character', 'getting', 'know', 'movie', 'Not', 'lot', 'actors', 'have', 'hold', 'audience', 'does.Joe', 'Carnahan', 'pretty', 'prolific', 'director', 'hits', 'Smoking', 'Aces', 'huge', 'misses', 'A', 'Team', 'critically', 'overlooked', 'Narc', 'was', 'worried', 'would', 'underwhelm', 'yet', 'again', 'one', 'A', 'Team', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'great', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'glad', 'saw', 'movie', 'movie', 'talent', 'shown', 'Narc', 'level', 'solid', 'film-making', 'look', 'pace', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'made', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'certain', 'directors', 'material', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'mishandled', 'did', 'fine', 'fact', 'could', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'moved', 'point', 'point', 'saw', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'ACTION', 'FEST', 'TO', 'END', 'ALL', 'ACTION', 'FEST', 'movie', 'trailer', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'Everything', 'just', 'well', 'rounded', 'here', 'have', 'flaws.First', 'flaw', 'side', 'characters', 'worked', 'Nesson', 'character', 'barely', 'had', 'time', 'get', 'story', 'know', '2-hour', 'time', 'limit', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'expanded', 'story', 'characters', 'because', 'last', 'scene', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'Nesson', 'character', 'basically', 'main', 'character', 'development', 'had', 'movie', 'rest', 'not', 'so', 'much.Yes', 'did', 'read', 'was', 'lack', 'ending', 'how', 'do', 'end', 'movie', 'hard', 'sit', 'computer', 'go', 'Ok', 'let', 'end', 'way', 'way', 'not', 'how', 'open', 'endings', 'are', 'perfect', 'movies', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'open', 'ending', 'make', 'think', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'character', 'film', 'ended', 'feel', 'other', 'reviewers', 'missed', 'theme', 'message', 'movie', 'point', 'where', 'are', 'making', 'criticisms', 'digesting', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'like', 'everything.Overall', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'great', 'thrill', 'ride', 'reviews', 'said', 'was', 'had', 'right', 'amounts', 'stuff', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'there', 'was', 'lack', 'parts', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'still', 'were', 'there', 'see']",The Grey

1491042,A2KZQ6ZK98FSI7,B005LAIIS0,"Keith Langkan ""kaivai""","[71, 107]","This movie was awful. Completely unbelievable and lame. Here are some of the MAIN reasons why this was stupid!1.)  Liam write a letter to his EX with an old school fountain pen.  Really? He is in the middle of Alaska and hes using a fountain pen?He saves this letter in his pocket.....THIS IS IMPORTANT.2.) Plane crashes and Liam furiously double belts himself in during its descent, yet after the crash he finds himself thrown from the wreckage, unscathed and not in the seat somehow even though he double belted himself in?3.)  Liam finds the seat that was in front of him (where he put that letter before the plane went to Hell)he was in somehow in the multitude of crazy burned bodies, debris, etc.  and recovers that letter written in ink....yet this letter is completely legible, he puts it in his pocket for safe keeping..4.) Wolves actually are MAD at these people, so they are in the middle of Alaska, killing them out of anger and not eating them? really?  give me a break.5.)  A wolf was actually eating someone (before they realized they were mad) next to a fire, yet now fire scares these wolves away?6.)  Liam pulls out that letter in the snow, yet still the ink hasnt run and the letter is in perfect codition.7.) So they run from the wolves, come to a 200 FT high cliff...manage to jump to a tree...descend the tree......yet these same wolves somehow made it 200FT down and across a freezing cold river in 3 minutes so they could attack one of the survivors? Really? So wolves can now fly?8.)  Liam and his last buddy fall into a freezing river, his buddy somehow gets his foot trapped in a way just not possible given the current...9.) After being soaked in the river, Liam pulls out that letter again..somehow its dry and legible STILL.....WTF?10.) Plane crahses, guy still has glasses on, perfectly intact somehow. BUT BUT he loses them while crawling on a rope with a slight breeze....reallllllllllly??????11.)  So Liam makes a point to retrieve all the wallets of the killed to honor them and for their families. Its hilarious that EVERYONE has a wallet packed with family photos that are truly sentimental.  This is important so Liam can look at them before he stacks them into a neat pile while the Alpha Wolf patiently watches him (while growling ferociously with yellow eyes) from 30 feeet away.  ""Grrrr Grrrr.....I will let this man reflect on his and other's lives before I kill him....grrr....grrrrr""Save yourself time and watch a werewolf movie.12) I can go on and on here,,this is one of the worst movies of the year....easily...The director obviously thought that having Liam was enough.....and assumed that the viewers are stupid.  Wolves dont act like this towards humans and they surely dont kill and NOT eat when there is basically NO food around them.

1491047,A356RFKNIG043B,B005LAIIS0,K. Swanson,"[1, 2]","I'm truly surprised to see so many bad reviews of this here. I for one was surprised by how solid it was, specifically because of Neeson's typically excellent performance. In fact, it's one of his best roles. Add that to a great score and tight direction and this is a chilling tale in every way.It's tough not to give spoilers for this one, so, short and sweet: it's occasionally very violent but it's always real violence, mostly wolf on man, and I'll take that any day over the numbing one hero shoots a hundred bad guys crap we usually get. This is much scarier, as it's believable. And it felt all too real at many moments, and that ever-present threat of (all-natural!) carnage adds a lot of suspense.The Grey has two classic scenes to boot: one of the best/worst plane crashes on film, and a truly fine death scene that transcends almost all other cinematic deaths. Perhaps it's those two scenes that turned folks off: they make us face a couple of very common fears, but not in an exploitative, fake way. That makes them all the more real and edgy.Neeson makes them work, as he does the whole film. The guy can act, and never does he feel like he's in a film. He carries it all, and this is one of the best acting jobs I've ever seen in a film like this. It starts out as man vs. man, then man vs nature, and finally it's man vs. himself. That's all of the dramatic basics wrapped up in one, and it works.The blu-ray is a good transfer, but features only deleted scenes, all rightfully so, and a commentary. BUT...the commentary features the director and two editors drinking scotch throughout, and as they get sauced they start getting more honest, which you almost never hear on these. Carnahan even goes so far as to say that he thinks the film didn't deserve to have been a box office number one, which is a wild thing to say about your own film. But the commentary is well worth checking out for just such moments; it's one of a kind. (I sure would love to have heard Hitchcock or Kurosawa discussing their films while knocking back a few!)All in all, if you like a good raw survival film, then this is your meat.

The movie studio spent tons of money advertising a kick-butt action movie with the latest, greatest action star: Liam Neeson.  What you'll get instead is a deeply psychological, slow story with a few bursts of action.The movie starts by showing that Liam Neeson's job is to project the oil workers from wolves and other predators.  It starts a little slow but luckily you don't have to wait long for the plane to crash.  Somehow, several of the men survive but immediately realize they are being preyed upon by a pack of wolves.  Instead of staying by the plane, they decide to huff it out through the wilderness to get back to civilization.  The plot goes downhill from there.  As the men are picked off one by one, you (the viewer) will get more frustrated with the insane abilities of the wolves to traverse ravines and teleport miles ahead of the survivors.  The wolves are also a combination of CG and puppets, which lack realism at almost all times.  I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that the audience in the theater booed when the movie ended.The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is that Liam Neeson is a master.  I will love him in pretty much anything he does, and he takes his art seriously.  Unfortunately, he is severely limited by the plot in the movie.I so wanted to like this movie, but it wasn't to be.

1491059,A24KZBAAUTC83R,B005LAIIS0,Mace & Lacey Gannon,"[5, 10]","I love movies like this.Unfortunately, this new movie had major issues even my city wife noticed right off.First off, let me say this is a solid movie, but came up short of being one of the greatest of its genre, due to the shortcomings of its storyline and survival techniques.First off, the crash of the plane: I had to suspend disbelief that so many could crash in a plane and come away almost, if not totally, unscathed. Liam Neeson's character wakes up all by himself in the snow, like a car had thrown him out on pillowy snow, not an airplane in brutal conditions. Yeah, right!Secondly: I had to again suspend disbelief that a group of timber wolves all the sudden hunt humans. At least the director/writer tried to explain this, but it was weak. (BTW, the CGI wolves were the best part of this movie!)So, again, as a moviegoer I have to say, OK, I'll let that go for the sake of entertainment.Thirdly: Why would manly men leave the plane crash? They had everything there! Food, shelter, warmth, and the very place that rescuers would be looking. And not one man created or fashioned weapons out of all the debris, even though a pack of huge wolves almost instantly attacked them! Stupid.Fourth: Now Liam Neeson's character plays the hunter that protects the oil men, killing and shootings wild wolves, right? And since he is supposed to know about hunting, animals behavior, etc, then why does he take the survivors right to the very den of the wolves he told the men he was helping was the very bloody reason these wolves were acting the way they were?!Fifth: Now, why on earth did no character bother to fashion spears and walking sticks from the numerous trees that always surrounded them? Here they are, trudging wearily through snow drifts and snow storms, and not a one of them thinks primal! Not one of them thinks to trim some branches and make some makeshift weapons/walking sticks to help them defend themselves and just to walk. Been doing that since caveman days, but modern man in this movie never even thought of it. Stupid!!!!!!Sure, in one scene Liam's character shows the others how to make a sort of shock stick out of branches and shells. OK, on the right track here. Problem is, they use them once and you never even see any of the characters use makeshift spears ever again, despite leg wounds and exhaustion. C'mon, do these directors and screen writers think the audience is that stupid? I guess so, their marketing sucked me in.And lastly is the ending. Total rip-off! Fade to black my ass! Just like the ending of The Sopranos. Rip-off.The movie had so much going for it, too. Haunting. Good idea. Interesting characters and plight. Almost totally wasted to to piss poor directing and writing in minute details that even my NY city wife could see that was so stupid and wrong with this film.I'm just glad the wolves won.",3,There were shades of Gray in this movie,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,2852,"['love', 'movies', 'this.Unfortunately', 'new', 'movie', 'had', 'major', 'issues', 'even', 'city', 'wife', 'noticed', 'right', 'off.First', 'let', 'say', 'solid', 'movie', 'came', 'up', 'short', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', 'genre', 'due', 'shortcomings', 'storyline', 'survival', 'techniques.First', 'off', 'crash', 'plane', 'had', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'so', 'many', 'could', 'crash', 'plane', 'come', 'away', 'almost', 'not', 'totally', 'unscathed', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'character', 'up', 'snow', 'car', 'had', 'thrown', 'out', 'pillowy', 'snow', 'not', 'airplane', 'brutal', 'conditions', 'Yeah', 'right', 'Secondly', 'had', 'again', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'group', 'timber', 'wolves', 'sudden', 'hunt', 'humans', 'least', 'director/writer', 'tried', 'explain', 'was', 'weak', 'BTW', 'CGI', 'wolves', 'were', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'So', 'again', 'moviegoer', 'have', 'say', 'OK', ""'ll"", 'let', 'go', 'sake', 'entertainment.Thirdly', 'Why', 'would', 'manly', 'men', 'leave', 'plane', 'crash', 'had', 'everything', 'there', 'Food', 'shelter', 'warmth', 'very', 'place', 'rescuers', 'would', 'be', 'looking', 'not', 'one', 'man', 'created', 'fashioned', 'weapons', 'debris', 'even', 'pack', 'huge', 'wolves', 'almost', 'instantly', 'attacked', 'Stupid.Fourth', 'Now', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'character', 'hunter', 'oil', 'men', 'killing', 'shootings', 'wild', 'wolves', 'right', 'supposed', 'know', 'hunting', 'animals', 'behavior', 'etc', 'then', 'why', 'take', 'survivors', 'right', 'very', 'den', 'wolves', 'told', 'men', 'was', 'helping', 'was', 'very', 'bloody', 'reason', 'wolves', 'were', 'acting', 'way', 'were', 'Fifth', 'Now', 'why', 'earth', 'did', 'character', 'bother', 'fashion', 'spears', 'walking', 'sticks', 'numerous', 'trees', 'always', 'surrounded', 'Here', 'are', 'trudging', 'wearily', 'snow', 'drifts', 'snow', 'storms', 'not', 'one', 'primal', 'Not', 'one', 'trim', 'branches', 'make', 'makeshift', 'weapons/walking', 'sticks', 'help', 'defend', 'just', 'walk', 'Been', 'doing', 'caveman', 'days', 'modern', 'man', 'movie', 'never', 'even', 'thought', 'Stupid', 'Sure', 'one', 'scene', 'Liam', 'character', 'others', 'how', 'make', 'sort', 'shock', 'stick', 'branches', 'shells', 'OK', 'right', 'track', 'here', 'Problem', 'use', 'once', 'never', 'even', 'see', 'characters', 'use', 'makeshift', 'spears', 'ever', 'again', 'leg', 'wounds', 'exhaustion', ""C'mon"", 'do', 'directors', 'screen', 'writers', 'think', 'audience', 'stupid', 'guess', 'so', 'marketing', 'sucked', 'in.And', 'lastly', 'ending', 'Total', 'rip-off', 'Fade', 'black', 'ass', 'Just', 'ending', 'Sopranos', 'Rip-off.The', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'too', 'Haunting', 'Good', 'idea', 'Interesting', 'characters', 'plight', 'Almost', 'totally', 'wasted', 'piss', 'poor', 'directing', 'writing', 'minute', 'details', 'even', 'NY', 'city', 'wife', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'wrong', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'wolves', 'won']",The Grey

The story builds to a sort of lone wolf metaphor at the end, but it takes place in a world dominated by real wolves; blood-thirty beasts who hunt and kill mercilessly a small group of testosterone-filled oil drillers stranded in the middle of a cold and snowy nowhere after a plane crash.

1491074,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005LAIIS0,M. Oleson,"[3, 7]","Let's get one thing out of the way.  This is not a story about psychotic rogue wolves seeking to eat humans.  This is not a story about werewolves.  It is about survival in a part of the world unwelcome to man.  A group of oil workers on the Alaska pipeline are heading to Anchorage for a little R and R when the plane goes down in the frozen wilderness.  Miraculously 7 survive the crash.  Liam Neeson is fortunately one of the survivors.  He is a marksman employed by the company and is charged with keeping the workers safe from wolves.  He is suicidal because of the recent death of his wife.  These early scenes must have been difficult for Neeson given his own personal circumstances.  In any case, those memories of his wife sustain him as he attempts to lead the survivors to safety.  Attempt is the operative word here.  In addition to below freezing temperatures, blizzards and a lack of food and water, the group must also deal with a pack of wolves looking for dinner.Ottway (Neeson) knows wolves are cunning hunters and will pick off the men one by one if they let their guard down.  The movie is terribly moving at times as each of the men has their own skeletons in the closet or loved ones waiting to see them.  They are full of grit but a lack of weapons and adaptability to the elements puts them at great risk.  Yes there are confrontations both with the wolves and each other.

1491091,A2BUBB68YIE8MK,B005LAIIS0,Nicholas Ahern,"[7, 11]","Spoilers referencedA job at the end of the world. Stuck in the bleak arctic, Ottway (Liam Neeson) is a sniper hired by an oil crew to protect them against the worst nature has. With his dark past very present in his mind, he boards a company airplane home with an oil crew as uncivilized as the landscape. After a random storm, the plane crashes in a frozen hell of ravenous wolves and unforgiving conditions. With only wits and ebbing resources, Ottway realizes they are being stalked by a pack of wolves. And it becomes a race between species to out-fight the other as the cold blizzard brings most certain death.And it is not just man against nature. It is man versus death.As the opening voice over narrates the futility of a life devoid of meaning, Ottway is preparing to commit suicide. With his heart broken and his spirit in pieces, The Grey begins where most stories about redemption end. Neeson, with his gravelly voice and sunken eyes, is the last candidate I expected to find in this story, touted as ""Taken"" with wolves. As advertised, The Grey was touted as Liam Neeson kicking ass and making slippers out of the remains of wolf.Instead, we get a soulful and complex figure haunted by the demons of the past, as well as the specter of death, and Neeson transcends his own acting action film persona to give us a character who is both fragile and strong. A man who bleeds and begs of the Divine to save him. The scene that involves Neeson literally screaming and cursing the Divine is both chilling in it's realism and horrifying when we realize that he might actually be right. The scene is so profound when one thinks about the personal background of Neeson, who lost his wife several years before.When taken in that way, the scene that has now become inescapably haunting in my mind is all the more visceral and real. I wasn't certain it was Ottway who was screaming at the Divine, but Neeson. Though, I've heard that Neeson is a Roman Catholic, even the best of us find it crushing to even consider the hand of the Divine in the midst of unspeakable tragedy.Indeed, death gets quite a bit of screen time, both in conversation and action, with the wolves manipulating the group, and the fights are sparse but vicious and brutal. But that is not the point of the story, and director Joe Carnahan (The A-Team) doesn't dwell on the gore, only using it to point to the wider philosophical spectrum. The musical score is sparse, and allows the film to set it's own pace, which allows for the silences to speak louder about the characters. There are scenes of graphic violence involving people's in a state of shock being ripped apart, but the images are often beautiful in their transcendent power. The violence is not the point.Death, and how we deal with it, is the point. It is cold, calculating, and inescapable. Like God's judgment, there is nothing we can do to be free of it's curse. At least, for now.I sat on my couch for three hours last night, pondering the philosophical concepts of The Grey. I didn't remember the blood, the jump scenes, the scenery, the music or the acting; though all of that is outstanding. But, The Grey is not about the wolves, or even about Liam Neeson. It is first and foremost a story about God, and where He is when suffering bares it's fangs. The film is not necessarily interested in answering the provocative questions it presents, nor should it, but it presents them in the midst of transcendent emotion and complex spirituality.The ending is akin to The Sopranos, and it will divide audiences. I personally felt it ended on a pitch-perfect note, both ambiguous and gripping. It allows it's themes to fully remain intact without succumbing to cliche, and frankly, it is refreshing to see a film end a film on it's own terms, rather than on the expectations of it's audience.The twist that is revealed will not rock your world, but the climactic build up to it had tears in my eyes. It forces us to look beyond the present state of chaos and focus on what gives life meaning. And does that meaning involving more than an instinct for survival?Once more into the frayInto the last good fight I'll ever knowLive and die on this dayLive and die on this dayCome for the wolves, stay for the rest.

This movie is set in Alaska and this certainly adds to the challenge of staying alive, we even get a really good look at how this environment affects each character. (No I don't just mean the shivering or a red nose) What I mean is that the weather slowly but surely wears each and every character down, even to the point where one character dies due to the weather. You (the audience) begin to get a feel for just how scared and desperate each character  becomes as their hope for survival begins to dwindle down to nothing.This story follows 6 oil pipeline workers and a skilled hunter who was hired by the pipeline to protect the workers from the wolves that attempt to attack the workers. While the workers are returning home their plane crashes and they are forced to cooperate in order to survive.

The opening chapters of Jack London's ""White Fang"" are one of my favorite piece of literature, and the ""man versus Wolf"" set up, with the wolves representing wilderness, seemed really promising. However, this movie has just too many holes in it.The basic premise makes no sense. Here we have a sizable aircraft with dozens of passengers crashing on a known route of flight out on an open plain. There is absolutely no reason for the assumption that they will not be found very soon.Second, even if they were far off the planned route, leaving the relative protection and resources of the aircraft wreckage in order to be floundering through the snow doesn't seem a very smart choice.Next, Liam Neeson's character makes a big deal of standing firm and facing down the wolves, but then several times changes the strategy to: ""RUN!!!""Those are just a few samples. I'll move on to the general weaknesses of the movie.First, while the acting itself is good, Liam Neeson plays, well, basically Liam Neeson, and none of the other characters give us any particular reason to care about them.Second, the utter predictability of the storyline. The characters die one by one, and did anybody seriously expect the finale to be anything but a confrontation between Neeson and the alpha wolf? And to add insult to injury, the audience is even cheated out of that.Finally, the wolves. The production uses some footage of real wolves, but mostly they're a combination of really bad special effects and pretty amateurish CGI. For example, when we first see the whole pack through the reflection of their eyes outside the fire circle, they basically look like a bunch of production assistants holding pairs of LED lights (which is probably what they were) The alpha wolf in the final scene looks more like the black smoke from LOST than a wolf. I mean, the producers of ""The Ghost and the Darkness"" were able to manage fully grown lions in a credible way, and here they can't get the wolves right?So overall, a movie with a lot of promise was botched.",2,Disappointing (Spoiler alert!),1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,2069,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'opening', 'chapters', 'Jack', 'London', 'White', 'Fang', 'are', 'one', 'favorite', 'piece', 'literature', 'man', 'versus', 'Wolf', 'set', 'up', 'wolves', 'representing', 'wilderness', 'seemed', 'really', 'promising', 'However', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'holes', 'it.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'sense', 'Here', 'have', 'sizable', 'aircraft', 'dozens', 'passengers', 'crashing', 'known', 'route', 'flight', 'out', 'open', 'plain', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'assumption', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'very', 'soon.Second', 'even', 'were', 'far', 'planned', 'route', 'leaving', 'relative', 'protection', 'resources', 'aircraft', 'wreckage', 'order', 'be', 'floundering', 'snow', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'smart', 'choice.Next', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'character', 'big', 'deal', 'standing', 'firm', 'facing', 'down', 'wolves', 'then', 'several', 'times', 'strategy', 'RUN', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'samples', ""'ll"", 'move', 'general', 'weaknesses', 'movie.First', 'acting', 'good', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'well', 'basically', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'none', 'other', 'characters', 'give', 'particular', 'reason', 'care', 'them.Second', 'utter', 'predictability', 'storyline', 'characters', 'die', 'one', 'one', 'did', 'anybody', 'seriously', 'expect', 'finale', 'be', 'anything', 'confrontation', 'Neeson', 'alpha', 'wolf', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'audience', 'even', 'cheated', 'that.Finally', 'wolves', 'production', 'footage', 'real', 'wolves', 'mostly', ""'re"", 'combination', 'really', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'pretty', 'amateurish', 'CGI', 'example', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'whole', 'pack', 'reflection', 'eyes', 'fire', 'circle', 'basically', 'look', 'bunch', 'production', 'assistants', 'holding', 'pairs', 'LED', 'lights', 'probably', 'what', 'were', 'alpha', 'wolf', 'final', 'scene', 'more', 'black', 'smoke', 'LOST', 'wolf', 'mean', 'producers', 'Ghost', 'Darkness', 'were', 'able', 'manage', 'fully', 'grown', 'lions', 'credible', 'way', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'wolves', 'right', 'So', 'overall', 'movie', 'lot', 'promise', 'was', 'botched']",The Grey

Take these words as they are given, and do not even rent the film if you are squeamish. If you are prepared, this is a film that might bring you to your knees. It will leave you with a sense of foreboding.Liam Neeson is one of those actors that can take this kind of material and make it his own. He plays Ottaway, a man who has not much to live for, has gone to the wilds of Alaska to work for an oil drilling company. In the company of misfits and men who may be criminals or worse. Ottaway was hired as a marksman to shoot the wildlife that preyed upon the men as they worked. He is good at his job. The title of the film refers to wolves, 'The Grey' ones. This is a group of animals who travel in packs, are always hungry and will do whatever it takes to feed their hunger. In a sense that's exactly what this group of men have become. Ottaway seems suicidal, we see him put his gun in his mouth, but at the last minute he removes the barrel.Ottaway and a group of men are on their way to Fairbanks, the plane is being de-iced as we see the men board. This is a bumpy ride, none like I have seen before, and at the end of the bump, the plane gives down. Most of the men die, 7 live with various sorts of wounds. They find a bit of the plane and climb in for shelter. In the morning they find one of them killed by the wolves. They decide to move on, to try to find their way out of this wilderness. This is the story, this is their story, foraging through the wilderness, fighting off packs of wolves who are following them day and night. Building fires and fighting for their lives.

1491114,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B005LAIIS0,RMurray847,"[2, 7]","THE GREY is an okay movie.  If I tell you the basic story, you'll think it's just a typical pulp action film...but the quality of cinematography, sound, script and acting elevates it to something a bit loftier.  As I watched it, I appreciated the effort the filmmakers were putting into this.  An element of existentialism that you can actually feel on an emotional level.Yet at the same time, the film has people doing some incredibly stupid things, akin to what teenagers in slasher flicks might do.  Couching unexplainable behavior within an ""artsy"" framework doesn't make it any easier to swallow.Liam Neeson is introduced working at a far northern Alaska installation.  His job is as a sniper of wolves, keeping the compound safe from these dangerous predators.  He's also contemplating suicide, but holds off at the last moment.  Thus, he ends up on an ill-fated flight from the installation.  The plane goes down in the middle of nowhere, leaving about seven survivors amidst the wreckage.  It is during these post-crash scenes that we truly get to see what a natural, physical leader Neeson's character is.  He barks orders that quickly organize the survivors and he sternly but gently attends the dying moments of a passenger as he bleeds out.  The death is looked upon in a series of powerful close-ups...and the stage is set that this isn't merely a movie in which a death is simple and unemotional.  The scene has power, and it also serves as the moment when the other survivors (for the most part) embrace the notion that Neeson is going to be their leader.Soon, they discover that their wrecked fuselage is being stalked by man-eating wolves.  So Neeson decides that instead of waiting for possible but unlikely rescue in the plane and facing the wolves there, he suggests they grab what supplies they can and head for a tree line off in the distance, because he thinks the wolves MIGHT leave them alone if they think the men are leaving their territory.  This is a central decision, because most of the film follows thereafter...and yet it is not for ONE SECOND convincing.  It is stupid on the face of it.  Yes, wolves are stalking them...but they are in a location which provides some shelter from the HARSH wintry conditions, they have food and luggage to rummage through (which they never thoroughly do...who's to say someone wasn't carrying a satellite phone in their bag?) and it seems unlikely the wolves would swarm en masse into a giant steel structure.  And wouldn't large, ragged pieces of steel make excellent weapons against the wolves?  Instead, the men set out on foot in the hopes the wolves will leave them alone.  To say they made the wrong choice is understating matters (this is hardly a spoiler...it's what the film is ABOUT).  In my mind, Neeson is instantly established as a charismatic, tough-talking, tough-minded, physically adept FOOL.Once they have made this choice, what follows are a series of man vs. man & man vs. nature encounters.  The characters are all nicely sketched, and some, such as the ex-con presented by Frank Grillo, are actually very well-rounded.  The men bond.  They fight.  They endure.  They make ever more desperate choices.  And the movie actually asks some big questions about death and facing death.  The manner in which we chose to go out...when given a choice.  As I said, it's more existential than you might expect.  There is less action and more contemplation that some viewers probably expect.  It's refreshing that the film would take the time to explore some of the moral quandaries it does.  And it ends more logically than I would have expected, given some of the dumb choices from earlier in the film.I got past the terrible decision making early in the film, because I appreciated the excellent technical filmmaking throughout.  Director Joe Carnahan has given us a mean, unforgiving film...not a soft adventure where you can predict 10 minutes into it who will live and who will die.But even with all the good things I just said, THE GREY is lacking.  Just little things.  The weather is incredibly cold, yet frostbite and exposed faces is a non-issue.  A wolf viciously attacks one man, yet when the wolf is fought off, the man has virtually no injuries...yet in an earlier, similar scene, the victim is torn apart.  There are just enough annoying inconsistencies, coupled with the one really bad initial decision to have pulled me out of really committing to this film.  It's ultimately a three-star, just barely recommend for me.",3,"Many nicely done elements, but still a barely recommend.",1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,4514,"['GREY', 'okay', 'movie', 'tell', 'basic', 'story', ""'ll"", 'think', 'just', 'typical', 'pulp', 'action', 'film', 'quality', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'script', 'acting', 'elevates', 'something', 'bit', 'loftier', 'watched', 'appreciated', 'effort', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'putting', 'element', 'existentialism', 'can', 'actually', 'feel', 'emotional', 'level.Yet', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'people', 'doing', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'things', 'akin', 'what', 'teenagers', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'might', 'do', 'Couching', 'unexplainable', 'behavior', 'artsy', 'framework', ""n't"", 'make', 'easier', 'swallow.Liam', 'Neeson', 'introduced', 'working', 'far', 'northern', 'Alaska', 'installation', 'job', 'sniper', 'wolves', 'keeping', 'compound', 'safe', 'dangerous', 'predators', 'also', 'contemplating', 'suicide', 'off', 'last', 'moment', 'Thus', 'up', 'ill-fated', 'flight', 'installation', 'plane', 'down', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'leaving', 'seven', 'survivors', 'amidst', 'wreckage', 'post-crash', 'scenes', 'truly', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'natural', 'physical', 'leader', 'Neeson', 'character', 'orders', 'quickly', 'organize', 'survivors', 'sternly', 'gently', 'dying', 'moments', 'passenger', 'out', 'death', 'looked', 'series', 'powerful', 'close-ups', 'stage', 'set', ""n't"", 'merely', 'movie', 'death', 'simple', 'unemotional', 'scene', 'power', 'also', 'moment', 'when', 'other', 'survivors', 'most', 'part', 'notion', 'Neeson', 'going', 'be', 'leader.Soon', 'discover', 'wrecked', 'fuselage', 'being', 'stalked', 'man-eating', 'wolves', 'So', 'Neeson', 'instead', 'waiting', 'possible', 'unlikely', 'rescue', 'plane', 'facing', 'wolves', 'there', 'grab', 'what', 'can', 'head', 'tree', 'line', 'distance', 'wolves', 'MIGHT', 'leave', 'alone', 'think', 'men', 'are', 'leaving', 'territory', 'central', 'decision', 'most', 'film', 'thereafter', 'yet', 'not', 'ONE', 'SECOND', 'convincing', 'stupid', 'face', 'Yes', 'wolves', 'are', 'stalking', 'are', 'location', 'shelter', 'HARSH', 'wintry', 'conditions', 'have', 'food', 'luggage', 'rummage', 'never', 'thoroughly', 'do', 'who', 'say', 'someone', 'was', ""n't"", 'carrying', 'satellite', 'phone', 'bag', 'unlikely', 'wolves', 'would', 'swarm', 'en', 'masse', 'giant', 'steel', 'structure', 'would', ""n't"", 'large', 'ragged', 'pieces', 'steel', 'make', 'excellent', 'weapons', 'wolves', 'Instead', 'men', 'set', 'out', 'foot', 'hopes', 'wolves', 'will', 'leave', 'alone', 'say', 'made', 'wrong', 'choice', 'understating', 'matters', 'hardly', 'spoiler', 'what', 'film', 'ABOUT', 'mind', 'Neeson', 'instantly', 'established', 'charismatic', 'tough-talking', 'tough-minded', 'physically', 'adept', 'FOOL.Once', 'have', 'made', 'choice', 'what', 'are', 'series', 'man', 'vs.', 'man', 'man', 'vs.', 'nature', 'encounters', 'characters', 'are', 'nicely', 'sketched', 'such', 'ex-con', 'presented', 'Frank', 'Grillo', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'well-rounded', 'men', 'bond', 'fight', 'endure', 'make', 'ever', 'more', 'desperate', 'choices', 'movie', 'actually', 'big', 'questions', 'death', 'facing', 'death', 'manner', 'chose', 'go', 'out', 'when', 'given', 'choice', 'said', 'more', 'existential', 'might', 'expect', 'less', 'action', 'more', 'contemplation', 'viewers', 'probably', 'expect', 'refreshing', 'film', 'would', 'take', 'time', 'explore', 'moral', 'quandaries', 'more', 'logically', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'given', 'dumb', 'choices', 'earlier', 'film.I', 'got', 'terrible', 'decision', 'making', 'early', 'film', 'appreciated', 'excellent', 'technical', 'filmmaking', 'Director', 'Joe', 'Carnahan', 'given', 'mean', 'unforgiving', 'film', 'not', 'soft', 'adventure', 'where', 'can', 'predict', '10', 'minutes', 'who', 'will', 'live', 'who', 'will', 'die.But', 'even', 'good', 'things', 'just', 'said', 'THE', 'GREY', 'lacking', 'Just', 'little', 'things', 'weather', 'incredibly', 'cold', 'yet', 'frostbite', 'exposed', 'non-issue', 'wolf', 'viciously', 'one', 'man', 'yet', 'when', 'wolf', 'fought', 'off', 'man', 'virtually', 'injuries', 'yet', 'earlier', 'similar', 'scene', 'victim', 'torn', 'apart', 'are', 'just', 'enough', 'annoying', 'inconsistencies', 'coupled', 'one', 'really', 'bad', 'initial', 'decision', 'have', 'pulled', 'really', 'committing', 'film', 'ultimately', 'three-star', 'just', 'barely', 'recommend']",The Grey

There's so much wrong here it's hard to not to make a laundry list.As a reviewer elsewhere noted, this movie is a sort of meditation on death and God.  As these big wolves kill again and again (and get killed themselves in a couple of instances), the despair of the men grows as does anger against God for allowing this carnage.  Ottway collects the wallets of the dead, and it becomes clear to the movie viewer that these rough, profane men at the edge of the world are nonetheless linked to civilization through their families.  Their wives' and childrens' pictures are in those wallets, save for troublemaker Diaz's.  In its own way this movie is almost religious about serious matters of life, God, family, death, things we hang on to or think about ultimately.But oy veh.  A troubled Ottway, wolf-killer hired by the oil company to protect its workers, early on sets out to kill himself.  He sticks his rifle's barrel into his mouth but is distracted at the last moment.  But this is northern Alaska in bitterly cold weather: why didn't his mouth freeze to the gun barrel like a kid's tongue to a flag pole?  Stranger yet, his ammo is shown to be shotgun shells, which feature before the ill-fated airplane flight and during the desperate fight against the wolves after the crash.  But he has a rifle, not a shotgun!  (In passing, his rifle was aboard the aircraft but destroyed in the crash.)  Speaking of shotgun shells, Ottway rigs them up to spears made of saplings to go off when rammed against a wolf.  Truth is, without a barrel to channel the explosive gases, the worst the shell would do is sting the wolf, not kill it.  (Such testing of shells and cartridges shows that they barely penetrate nearby cardboard when ignited in the open.)Still, the device is successfully used once, and then all those sharp spears and shells the other men had mysteriously vanish.  Absolutely senseless movie-making.Now, an airliner crash would have dozens of families alerted, aircraft everywhere searching for the wreck and survivors, and oil company searchers on the loose.  Yet somehow the crash survivors convince themselves that no one will come looking, or care, or if one does he'd never find them, despite the massive wreckage being right out in the open in a huge clearing.  I know that without this conceit there wouldn't be a movie at all, but there must be another way to strand them without comical assumptions that the world wouldn't even bother looking for them.Other Amazon reviewers note this, so let me just add my agreement: How dumb can you be to leave the plane wreckage behind, which is shelter, clothing, fuel, and at least some food and drink not to mention a huge landmark for searchers to see, to set out across a shelterless plain toward a shelterless tree line with proven killer wolves around?  In this instance a pretty good movie could have been made about these men improvising a defense in the plane's remains against these wolves, it seems to me.For as cold as it was supposed to be, there was a frequent lack of vapor from breathing, much like in the better movie ""The Edge.""  From personal experience I can assure the reader that temperatures that cold would not have you lounging around a small campfire with your gloves off or sleeping comfortably under one blanket.For those who care, the F bomb is used a couple of hundred times in the movie as noun, verb, present participle, intensifier, adjective, adverb, interjection, and all-purpose space filler.  Even these days most people don't talk like that.  It's time for moviemakers to be a little more creative in their oaths.  How about, say, ""cursed Satan spawn"" or ""damnable colon-formed wolves""?Well.  You'll have to decide for yourself if the ending was satisfactory.  The ""neat resolutionist"" in me didn't care much for it, but it does fit in well with the general ambiguity of the movie, nothing being certain but death and taxes.  Or is there something else beyond those?  Are those figures who come for or comfort their dying men just hallucinations, or something more divine?",3,"If Mankind Were this Stupid, Wolves Would Rule",1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,4183,"['movie', 'hair', 'breadth', 'two', 'star', 'rating', 'only', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'work', 'Ottway', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'hard', 'not', 'make', 'laundry', 'reviewer', 'elsewhere', 'noted', 'movie', 'sort', 'meditation', 'death', 'God', 'big', 'wolves', 'kill', 'again', 'again', 'get', 'killed', 'couple', 'instances', 'despair', 'men', 'anger', 'God', 'allowing', 'carnage', 'Ottway', 'wallets', 'dead', 'clear', 'movie', 'viewer', 'rough', 'profane', 'men', 'edge', 'world', 'are', 'nonetheless', 'linked', 'civilization', 'families', 'wives', 'childrens', 'pictures', 'are', 'wallets', 'save', 'troublemaker', 'Diaz', 'own', 'way', 'movie', 'almost', 'religious', 'serious', 'matters', 'life', 'God', 'family', 'death', 'things', 'hang', 'think', 'ultimately.But', 'oy', 'veh', 'troubled', 'Ottway', 'wolf-killer', 'hired', 'oil', 'company', 'protect', 'workers', 'early', 'sets', 'out', 'kill', 'rifle', 'barrel', 'mouth', 'distracted', 'last', 'moment', 'northern', 'Alaska', 'bitterly', 'cold', 'weather', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'mouth', 'freeze', 'gun', 'barrel', 'kid', 'tongue', 'flag', 'pole', 'Stranger', 'yet', 'ammo', 'shown', 'be', 'shotgun', 'shells', 'feature', 'ill-fated', 'airplane', 'flight', 'desperate', 'fight', 'wolves', 'crash', 'rifle', 'not', 'shotgun', 'passing', 'rifle', 'was', 'aircraft', 'destroyed', 'crash', 'Speaking', 'shotgun', 'shells', 'Ottway', 'up', 'spears', 'made', 'saplings', 'go', 'off', 'when', 'rammed', 'wolf', 'Truth', 'barrel', 'channel', 'explosive', 'gases', 'worst', 'shell', 'would', 'do', 'sting', 'wolf', 'not', 'kill', 'Such', 'testing', 'shells', 'cartridges', 'barely', 'penetrate', 'nearby', 'cardboard', 'when', 'ignited', 'open', 'Still', 'device', 'successfully', 'used', 'once', 'then', 'sharp', 'spears', 'shells', 'other', 'men', 'had', 'mysteriously', 'vanish', 'Absolutely', 'senseless', 'movie-making.Now', 'airliner', 'crash', 'would', 'have', 'dozens', 'families', 'alerted', 'aircraft', 'everywhere', 'searching', 'wreck', 'survivors', 'oil', 'company', 'searchers', 'loose', 'somehow', 'crash', 'survivors', 'convince', 'one', 'will', 'come', 'looking', 'care', 'one', ""'d"", 'never', 'find', 'massive', 'wreckage', 'being', 'right', 'out', 'open', 'huge', 'clearing', 'know', 'conceit', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'way', 'strand', 'comical', 'assumptions', 'world', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'looking', 'them.Other', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'note', 'so', 'let', 'just', 'add', 'agreement', 'How', 'dumb', 'can', 'be', 'leave', 'plane', 'wreckage', 'shelter', 'clothing', 'fuel', 'least', 'food', 'drink', 'not', 'mention', 'huge', 'landmark', 'searchers', 'see', 'set', 'out', 'shelterless', 'plain', 'shelterless', 'tree', 'line', 'proven', 'killer', 'wolves', 'around', 'instance', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'men', 'improvising', 'defense', 'plane', 'remains', 'wolves', 'me.For', 'as', 'cold', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'was', 'frequent', 'lack', 'vapor', 'breathing', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'Edge', 'personal', 'experience', 'can', 'assure', 'reader', 'cold', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'lounging', 'small', 'campfire', 'gloves', 'off', 'sleeping', 'comfortably', 'one', 'blanket.For', 'who', 'care', 'F', 'bomb', 'used', 'couple', 'hundred', 'times', 'movie', 'noun', 'verb', 'present', 'participle', 'intensifier', 'adjective', 'adverb', 'interjection', 'all-purpose', 'space', 'filler', 'Even', 'days', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'time', 'moviemakers', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'creative', 'oaths', 'How', 'say', 'cursed', 'Satan', 'spawn', 'damnable', 'colon-formed', 'wolves', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'have', 'decide', 'ending', 'was', 'satisfactory', 'neat', 'resolutionist', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'fit', 'well', 'general', 'ambiguity', 'movie', 'nothing', 'being', 'certain', 'death', 'taxes', 'there', 'something', 'else', 'Are', 'figures', 'who', 'come', 'comfort', 'dying', 'men', 'just', 'hallucinations', 'something', 'more', 'divine']",The Grey

Live and die on this day... live and die on this day.""That poem comes from THE GREY, the new adventure film starring Liam Neeson and reteaming him with his A-Team director Joe Carnahan, and in it's this statement of glory and sacrifice that lies the secret to why this movie works so well. Not told as a violent potboiler, as we have so often come to expect, that I dare say we accept, this is a story driven by characters with personalities and back stories, all driven in their quest to survive and helping their fellow survivors. This isn't just an action spectacle, it is an adventure and as such, it is a movie to cherish.The film, as you probably already know, takes place in Alaska and follows the plight of 8 men who survive an airplane crash. Armed with little more than the clothes on their backs, they must rely on one another as they seek refuge. Coming at them are not just the elements that could easily kill a man, but also a pack of angry wolves, who feel that their habitat has been violated and their for, they must destroy the invaders.Carnahan is a good director, with the exception of his underrated 2002 filmNarc, he hasn't up to this point shown himself to be much more than a technician, however. On THE GREY, he finally delivers on the promise of his earlier film, working from a script co-written by Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, based on Jeffer's story, this is riveting storytelling of the first order. Enhanced thanks to expert cinematography from Masanobu Takayanagi. Neeson is at his best in years, finally stepping away from the generic action pics that have started to define him. Also their is fine supporting work from Dallas Roberts and Dermot Mulrooney, among others.

1491135,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B005LAIIS0,Steve Douglas,"[1, 2]","I know that the newspaper reviewers panned this movie and many already have provided abundant reviews on Amazon with summaries of the plot, opinions on acting etc, so I will only focus upon the actual quality of the audio and video transfers to Blu Ray.  I will say that I found this movie both suspenseful and exciting.  I liked it no matter what the newspapers had to say.Keep in mind that the quality of what you see and hear also depends upon the quality of TV monitor you are using and its accompanying home theater processor and speakers. I have a pretty high end, esoteric system and am judging the Blu Ray off of that.VIDEO QUALITY....As most of this film takes place under dark and cloudy skies, snowy conditions and dismal environmental conditions the video imaging has been desaturated to a significant degree to add to those conditions.  Grain persists, I believe intentionally, throughout much of the film but I did not find that distracting.  If anything, the grain adds to the film's inhospitable environment.  Both contrast and focus has been softened, not to a bad degree, but in a snow storm, you would not expect to see each individual in sharp and clear focus.  Colors, tho desaturated, are true in their resolution.  At no point did I see any artifacting or problems with the video transfer.  The Mbps rate appeared to average in the mid 30's.AUDIO QUALITY....The DTS HD MA 5.1 lossless soundtrack is the true star of the Blu Ray's production with excellent use of your home theater's sound system.  There was plentiful use of each of your surround speakers, including your center channel with a great deal of discreet directionality sent to both  the front and rear sides.  With the LFE sub channel providing plenty of oomph to the sound track, the audio editing fully immerses you in the film.  The audio of The Grey is definitely demo worthy for those who want to show off their sound system.  While the lossless track is 5.1, I listened to the film on a 7.1 system with the extra two channels muxed as one which further went to creating that immersive ambience.EXTRAS....Not much here, there are several deleted or extended scenes that were interesting but would not necessarily make for a required extended cut release.  The only other true extra was the typical director's commentary which I did not listen to as yet.Unfortunately, there are several 'previews' of other films that only force you to pay for advertising which takes up more room on the Blu Ray itself.  These 'previews' mean that there is less room on the disc calling for even greater compression of the movie you paid for.  In this case, it is Universal who makes you pay for these ads but it appears that almost every production  house is doing the same thing.Also included is a Standard Def disc which can be downloaded to a Mac via iTunes or by use with Ultra Violet.  While the code inside said it was good only to May 31st, 2013, I had no issues redeeming the code to Universal's account.  While there, I noticed that 2 of my other films in that account were not available for streaming with no explanation.  I sent an email to them, with no response as yet, asking why two films I had paid for, were not available.  I really do not like UV, Universal's own site or most cloud types for this very reason.  I have never had a problem with iTunes so I will stick to that.  The film is downloading to iTunes as I write.I really enjoyed the suspense of this film and now am very happy I bought it.I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase. All of my reviews are of this nature and I hope they can be of HELP to you as well.Thanks for reading.",5,The Grey on Blu Ray,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,3750,"['know', 'newspaper', 'reviewers', 'panned', 'movie', 'many', 'already', 'have', 'provided', 'abundant', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'summaries', 'plot', 'opinions', 'acting', 'etc', 'will', 'only', 'focus', 'actual', 'quality', 'audio', 'video', 'transfers', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'will', 'say', 'found', 'movie', 'suspenseful', 'exciting', 'liked', 'matter', 'what', 'newspapers', 'had', 'say.Keep', 'mind', 'quality', 'what', 'see', 'hear', 'also', 'quality', 'TV', 'monitor', 'are', 'using', 'accompanying', 'home', 'theater', 'processor', 'speakers', 'have', 'pretty', 'high', 'end', 'esoteric', 'system', 'am', 'judging', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'that.VIDEO', 'QUALITY', 'most', 'film', 'place', 'dark', 'cloudy', 'skies', 'snowy', 'conditions', 'dismal', 'environmental', 'conditions', 'video', 'imaging', 'been', 'desaturated', 'significant', 'degree', 'add', 'conditions', 'Grain', 'persists', 'believe', 'intentionally', 'much', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'distracting', 'anything', 'grain', 'film', 'inhospitable', 'environment', 'contrast', 'focus', 'been', 'softened', 'not', 'bad', 'degree', 'snow', 'storm', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'see', 'individual', 'sharp', 'clear', 'focus', 'Colors', 'tho', 'desaturated', 'are', 'true', 'resolution', 'point', 'did', 'see', 'artifacting', 'problems', 'video', 'transfer', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'appeared', 'average', 'mid', ""30's.AUDIO"", 'QUALITY', 'DTS', 'HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'lossless', 'soundtrack', 'true', 'star', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'production', 'excellent', 'use', 'home', 'theater', 'sound', 'system', 'was', 'plentiful', 'use', 'surround', 'speakers', 'including', 'center', 'channel', 'great', 'deal', 'discreet', 'directionality', 'sent', 'front', 'rear', 'sides', 'LFE', 'sub', 'channel', 'providing', 'plenty', 'oomph', 'sound', 'track', 'audio', 'editing', 'fully', 'film', 'audio', 'Grey', 'definitely', 'demo', 'worthy', 'who', 'want', 'show', 'off', 'sound', 'system', 'lossless', 'track', '5.1', 'listened', 'film', '7.1', 'system', 'extra', 'two', 'channels', 'muxed', 'one', 'further', 'went', 'creating', 'immersive', 'ambience.EXTRAS', '.Not', 'much', 'here', 'are', 'several', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'were', 'interesting', 'would', 'not', 'necessarily', 'make', 'required', 'extended', 'cut', 'release', 'only', 'other', 'true', 'extra', 'was', 'typical', 'director', 'commentary', 'did', 'not', 'listen', 'yet.Unfortunately', 'are', 'several', ""'previews"", 'other', 'films', 'only', 'force', 'pay', 'advertising', 'up', 'more', 'room', 'Blu', 'Ray', ""'previews"", 'mean', 'less', 'room', 'disc', 'calling', 'even', 'greater', 'compression', 'movie', 'paid', 'case', 'Universal', 'who', 'pay', 'ads', 'almost', 'production', 'house', 'doing', 'same', 'thing.Also', 'included', 'Standard', 'Def', 'disc', 'can', 'be', 'downloaded', 'Mac', 'iTunes', 'use', 'Ultra', 'Violet', 'code', 'said', 'was', 'good', 'only', 'May', '31st', '2013', 'had', 'issues', 'redeeming', 'code', 'Universal', 'account', 'there', 'noticed', '2', 'other', 'films', 'account', 'were', 'not', 'available', 'streaming', 'explanation', 'sent', 'email', 'response', 'yet', 'asking', 'why', 'two', 'films', 'had', 'paid', 'were', 'not', 'available', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'UV', 'Universal', 'own', 'site', 'most', 'cloud', 'types', 'very', 'reason', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'problem', 'iTunes', 'so', 'will', 'stick', 'film', 'downloading', 'iTunes', 'write.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'suspense', 'film', 'now', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'bought', 'it.I', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'focused', 'solely', 'quality', 'actual', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'hope', 'can', 'be', 'HELP', 'well.Thanks', 'reading']",The Grey

1491137,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B005LAIIS0,Steven Aldersley,"[3, 5]","The presence of Liam Neeson is main reason that I wanted to see The Grey. I've become an even bigger fan since I bought Taken and saw that he could even bring depth to a character in an action movie. Neeson seems authentic in just about any role, even if he's just providing the voice for an animated character.In The Grey, Neeson is clearly the main character. We see him contemplate suicide at the start of the movie, before deciding against it. The story involves a group of oil workers stationed in Alaska. Ottway (Neeson) is a marksman who keeps the workers safe from wolves when they are at work. He carries a rifle and is always watching for possible attacks. He has a low opinion of most of the workers and doesn't enjoy having to spend time with them.Ottway's world changes when he's involved in a plane crash. The oil workers encounter bad weather and turbulence, and the resulting crash leaves most of the group dead or dying. It's here that Ottway assumes a leadership role without being asked or voted in. Like the wolves he kills, his instincts cannot be denied. In the surviving group, it quickly becomes clear that he's the alpha. Ottway has a way of facing facts and helping others to accept the inevitable. This is perfectly illustrated when one of the crash victims dies in front of him. Ottway calms him and takes charge of the situation when the other men are incapable of deciding how to handle it.The movie partly reminded me of The Edge, starring Anthony Hopkins. Although this group of survivors is larger, and they are hunted by wolves instead of a bear, the terrain is similar. The Grey seems realistic and doesn't idealize the situation in any way. The men are in danger and fighting for their lives, and their actions are plausible. If you are facing a pack of wolves unarmed, your chances of survival are not good. The Grey doesn't shy away from that fact.Action scenes are infrequent, but have considerable impact. How would you try to survive if you had no food or shelter and had to make your way through freezing snow? Would it be best to try to make your own way back to civilization, or stay at the crash site and hope for rescue?The movie explores the characters of several of the crash survivors and we come to understand their individual choices. The setting is grim, so don't expect a heartwarming story. This is real.I didn't know what to expect from The Grey, but it left me somewhat surprised. The body count was definitely higher than expected, and I assumed that the group would generate more internal conflict than it did. That said, I did feel as though I was a part of the quest for survival and I was engaged at all times. Neeson carried the movie, but three or four supporting characters were important to the story.If you enjoy experiencing things that you are unlikely to witness in your real life, The Grey is a compelling story which transports you to an unfamiliar setting. If you are sensitive to watching characters get picked off one at a time, it might not be for you.The Blu-ray offers a pleasing presentation. The audio is just about perfect, and you'll feel involved in scenes such as the plane crash. The picture quality is also very good, but sometimes appears intentionally grainy to heighten the effect of being lost in a bleak, snowy wilderness.",4,Much more realistic than I expected,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,3312,"['presence', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'main', 'reason', 'wanted', 'see', 'Grey', ""'ve"", 'become', 'even', 'bigger', 'fan', 'bought', 'Taken', 'saw', 'could', 'even', 'bring', 'depth', 'character', 'action', 'movie', 'Neeson', 'authentic', 'just', 'role', 'even', 'just', 'providing', 'voice', 'animated', 'character.In', 'Grey', 'Neeson', 'clearly', 'main', 'character', 'see', 'contemplate', 'suicide', 'start', 'movie', 'deciding', 'story', 'group', 'oil', 'workers', 'stationed', 'Alaska', 'Ottway', 'Neeson', 'marksman', 'who', 'workers', 'safe', 'wolves', 'when', 'are', 'work', 'rifle', 'always', 'watching', 'possible', 'attacks', 'low', 'opinion', 'most', 'workers', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'having', 'spend', 'time', 'them.Ottway', 'world', 'changes', 'when', 'involved', 'plane', 'crash', 'oil', 'workers', 'encounter', 'bad', 'weather', 'turbulence', 'resulting', 'crash', 'most', 'group', 'dead', 'dying', 'here', 'Ottway', 'leadership', 'role', 'being', 'asked', 'voted', 'wolves', 'instincts', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'surviving', 'group', 'quickly', 'clear', 'alpha', 'Ottway', 'way', 'facing', 'facts', 'helping', 'others', 'accept', 'inevitable', 'perfectly', 'illustrated', 'when', 'one', 'crash', 'victims', 'front', 'Ottway', 'calms', 'charge', 'situation', 'when', 'other', 'men', 'are', 'incapable', 'deciding', 'how', 'handle', 'it.The', 'movie', 'partly', 'reminded', 'Edge', 'starring', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'group', 'survivors', 'larger', 'are', 'hunted', 'wolves', 'instead', 'bear', 'terrain', 'similar', 'Grey', 'realistic', ""n't"", 'idealize', 'situation', 'way', 'men', 'are', 'danger', 'fighting', 'lives', 'actions', 'are', 'plausible', 'are', 'facing', 'pack', 'wolves', 'unarmed', 'chances', 'survival', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'Grey', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'fact.Action', 'scenes', 'are', 'infrequent', 'have', 'considerable', 'impact', 'How', 'would', 'try', 'survive', 'had', 'food', 'shelter', 'had', 'make', 'way', 'freezing', 'snow', 'Would', 'be', 'best', 'try', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'back', 'civilization', 'stay', 'crash', 'site', 'hope', 'rescue', 'movie', 'characters', 'several', 'crash', 'survivors', 'come', 'understand', 'individual', 'choices', 'setting', 'grim', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'real.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Grey', 'left', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'body', 'count', 'was', 'definitely', 'higher', 'expected', 'assumed', 'group', 'would', 'generate', 'more', 'internal', 'conflict', 'did', 'said', 'did', 'feel', 'was', 'part', 'quest', 'survival', 'was', 'engaged', 'times', 'Neeson', 'carried', 'movie', 'three', 'four', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'important', 'story.If', 'enjoy', 'experiencing', 'things', 'are', 'unlikely', 'witness', 'real', 'life', 'Grey', 'compelling', 'story', 'unfamiliar', 'setting', 'are', 'sensitive', 'watching', 'characters', 'get', 'picked', 'off', 'one', 'time', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'you.The', 'Blu-ray', 'pleasing', 'presentation', 'audio', 'just', 'perfect', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'involved', 'scenes', 'such', 'plane', 'crash', 'picture', 'quality', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'sometimes', 'intentionally', 'grainy', 'heighten', 'effect', 'being', 'lost', 'bleak', 'snowy', 'wilderness']",The Grey

1491145,A23FDMTREBQC7P,B005LAIIS0,Todd O'Rourke,"[4, 6]","""The Grey"" follows a group of oil company workers at a pumping station in North Alaska, described by Ottway (Liam Neeson) as hell, occupied by ""men unfit for mankind.""  These men seem to be looking for a job with good pay, no matter what the risks.  In the beginning of the film you see the men sleeping and drinking in their free time, oblivious to the outside world.A small group of men including Ottway, board a small airplane on leave from work.  During their turbulent flight, the plane manages to crash and leave the small ragtag group of individuals in who knows where.  Most of the men are killed quickly during the crash or die soon afterwards, but seven members of the group stay alive.  They have hope that they will be discovered, however, with the snow rapidly covering their crash sight, their hope quickly turns into desperation.  When one of the seven men decides to take a leak, ravenous wolves quickly pounce on him.  This becomes the setup for the rest of the film.  The thought that they not only have to deal with the elements, but also feral wolves, has to be demoralizing.The frantic journey these men endure is brought to life by terrific acting, mostly because of Liam Neeson, but the rest of the actors due well with bringing their roles to life.  What I enjoyed the most out of the whole film was the director's (Joe Carnahan) dedication to focusing on the individual, not just the overall group.  Each man felt like he had something to live for.  Although none of the characters are as developed as Ottway, you get a sense that these men had lives outside of Alaska.The ending may be seen as underdeveloped in many eyes, but I honestly liked the open ending.

I have tried to stay away from the clich&eacute; moviereview lines, but this is best described as an exhilarating adventurethat grabs you and doesn't let go till the last frame. Going in I heardthat the ending was horrible and ruined the movie. After watching thisI am wondering what they were talking about. The ending was perfect andmade me like the movie even more.

1491148,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B005LAIIS0,trebe,"[1, 2]","The Grey (2011) is a tale of survival set in the snowy Alaskan wilderness, where the survivors of a plane crash, battle both the elements, and a pack of hyper-aggressive, and extremely territorial wolves.  The film plausibly sets up a brutal crisis situation, but soon drifts off into fantasy, as escaping the wolves becomes the paramount concern.With a strong cast headed by Liam Neeson (Taken,The A-Team), this gritty adventure is engaging, features some scenic cinematography, and definitely delivers some thrills.  Unfortunately, the unrealistic behavior of the wolves, and other discordant elements, along with some less than convincing special effects, soon distract from what could have been a more solid story.A group of oil company workers at a remote Alaskan camp, are on a night flight bound for civilization, when the plane unexpectedly develops problems, and crashes in the snow covered woods.  Only a handful survive, and John Ottway (Neeson), whose job is to hunt and kill wolves around the camp, emerges as the leader of the group.  Huddled in the wreckage of the plane, keeping warm is the initial priority, but after the survivors are challenged by a pack of wolves, and the animals kill  one of the group during the night, Ottway decides that retreat is their only hope.Supposedly acting to protect their territory, the wolves follow, and aggressively strike when the opportunity presents itself, further reducing the group's numbers.  The survivors eventually are forced to take desperate measures, but no matter what they do, they can't escape the pursuing wolves.The Grey has some great natural settings, and with a solid supporting cast that includes Frank Grillo, Dermont Mulroney, and Dallas Roberts, the acting is pretty good.  With the action largely driven by the ""unlikely"" behavior of the wolves, which in turn results in some strange actions by the survivors, the film's credibility is severely undermined.  Early on, Ottway is attacked by a wolf, and incredibly suffers absolutely no harm, as the group mostly fails to arm themselves.  The cold hardly seems to have an effect on the men, even after taking a dip in a chilly river.  Then when the story attempts to weave in spiritual and religious elements, it's difficult to take seriously, as things have already strayed away too far.  The mostly unconvincing CG wolves, are another major distraction.Competently made, and with some exciting moments, The Grey is entertaining, although it's more of a wilderness fantasy, who's ""message"" may largely be lost in the swirling Alaskan winds.

When a plane carrying Alaskan pipeline workers crashes in the middle of nowhere, the nine survivors find themselves in a struggle for survival; their plane has crashed in an area where a pack of grey wolves hunt and the seven survivors must face off against a brutal, fierce enemy that has every advantage except one--the human will to survive.Featuring a terrific supporting cast (Dermot Mulroney, Frank Grillo among others)and a strong script that manages to quickly sketch in the seven characters at the heart of the film.A bit of a left turn for director Joe Carnahan after the big studio productions he has directed of late (""The A-Team""), ""The Grey"" returns the director to the smaller ensemble based thrillers/dramas he began with--""Narc"" and ""Smokin' Aces"" that help make his reputation- demonstrating that, as good as he is at big Hollywood productions, he's better with smaller, more intimate productions like ""The Grey"".The Blu-ray is a sharp, nicely detailed transfer. Audio sounds powerful and is VERY active putting you right there in the wilderness with our main characters.The special features are a bit limited--we get deleted scenes (some extended versions of some in the film) and a great, very frank commentary track from the director with editors Roger Barton and Jason Hellmann.

In fact, there is really only one scene where the humans are able to retaliate and kick some wolf butt. Otherwise, the humans slowly succumb to both the wolves and harsh winter climate. So the movie is rather depressing if you watch it thinking you are going to see an awesome display of the human will to survive against all odds.
