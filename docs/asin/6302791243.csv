334505,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,6302791243,Char,"[0, 0]","Came out in 1993 and is similar to the films based on Henry James novels.  A movie that is typical of the trend in the 90s for glorifying in gorgeous color the typical beauty of the clothing, architecture, and furnishings of the 19th century Victorian world (which could not possibly have been as perfectly beautiful as pictured here) while setting a love story that embodies the warmth of male-female attractions within that carefully mannered culture.Here we see how males were strictly sequestered at snooty Oxford U and how high-minded Victorians went on walking tours in Europe and the Swiss Alps--and fell into friendships and love.  This is a ""true story"" based on the diary of Michael Palin's ancestor.  Michael Palin is the lead male actor in the movie.  (I didn't know WHO Michael Palin was! or why the story of his great grandfather's experience should be all that noteworthy.  I have since looked him up on-line in order to find out who Michael Palen was/is, and so now I know that he is an actor and comedian who is one of the ""Monty Python"" bunch of comedians.  But this movie is definitely NOT a Monty Python type of thing.)There was a heavy weight of decorative visual beautification in the movie and a lot of pretty filling between the choice bits of conversation.  Anyone with a taste for Victoriana would find this movie ""hog heaven.""  There is some nice humor, too.  Except for the heavily sensual, pre-Raphaelitish beauty that permeates every scene in the movie, it is a quiet and understated story.  There are no scenes of explicit sexual intimacy.  This is the story of a quiet man with a religious vocation who prefers silence and solitude, a middle-aged lady who can't help falling in love with him, and the regrettable seduction of a pretty young woman after which Palin picks up the pieces.Although the movie was a gorgeous visual experience, it was not a DEEPLY meaningful IMPORTANT story (I mean not any more so than EVERYBODY'S personal love story IS deeply meaningful to themselves--and to their subsequent families).  Overall, the film has a mild effect.  It conveys a mild sense of the quietly happy redemption of a regrettable seduction (which fortunately and appropriately, especially since the man was a cad, is only suggested on film) and a resulting pregnancy.",4,Friends and loves in Beautiful Victorian settings,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,2298,"['Came', 'out', '1993', 'similar', 'films', 'based', 'Henry', 'James', 'novels', 'movie', 'typical', 'trend', '90s', 'glorifying', 'gorgeous', 'color', 'typical', 'beauty', 'clothing', 'architecture', 'furnishings', '19th', 'century', 'Victorian', 'world', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'have', 'been', 'perfectly', 'beautiful', 'pictured', 'here', 'setting', 'love', 'story', 'warmth', 'male-female', 'attractions', 'carefully', 'mannered', 'culture.Here', 'see', 'how', 'males', 'were', 'strictly', 'sequestered', 'snooty', 'Oxford', 'U', 'how', 'high-minded', 'Victorians', 'went', 'walking', 'tours', 'Europe', 'Swiss', 'Alps', 'fell', 'friendships', 'love', 'true', 'story', 'based', 'diary', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'ancestor', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'lead', 'male', 'actor', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'WHO', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'was', 'why', 'story', 'great', 'grandfather', 'experience', 'should', 'be', 'noteworthy', 'have', 'looked', 'up', 'on-line', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'Michael', 'Palen', 'was/is', 'so', 'now', 'know', 'actor', 'comedian', 'who', 'one', 'Monty', 'Python', 'bunch', 'comedians', 'movie', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'Monty', 'Python', 'type', 'thing', 'was', 'heavy', 'weight', 'decorative', 'visual', 'beautification', 'movie', 'lot', 'pretty', 'filling', 'choice', 'bits', 'conversation', 'Anyone', 'taste', 'Victoriana', 'would', 'find', 'movie', 'hog', 'heaven', 'nice', 'humor', 'too', 'heavily', 'sensual', 'pre-Raphaelitish', 'beauty', 'scene', 'movie', 'quiet', 'understated', 'story', 'are', 'scenes', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'intimacy', 'story', 'quiet', 'man', 'religious', 'vocation', 'who', 'silence', 'solitude', 'middle-aged', 'lady', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'falling', 'love', 'regrettable', 'seduction', 'pretty', 'young', 'woman', 'Palin', 'up', 'movie', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'visual', 'experience', 'was', 'not', 'DEEPLY', 'meaningful', 'IMPORTANT', 'story', 'mean', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'EVERYBODY', 'personal', 'love', 'story', 'IS', 'deeply', 'meaningful', 'subsequent', 'families', 'Overall', 'film', 'mild', 'effect', 'mild', 'sense', 'quietly', 'happy', 'redemption', 'regrettable', 'seduction', 'fortunately', 'appropriately', 'especially', 'man', 'was', 'cad', 'only', 'suggested', 'film', 'resulting', 'pregnancy']",N/A

It's a quiet but intelligent and human film about an Oxford don who gives up his academic life for an American girl whom he meets while holidaying in Switzerland.

I remember seeing it simply because Michael Palin was in it, and I am a major Python fan (like almost everyone in the world).  This film is not a comedy (I kind of knew that going in), but it is gentle, serene, beautifully shot, and quite moving by the end.  Palin acquits himself wonderfully as the Oxford professor, as does the rest of the cast.  I was really surprised by how quite profound some of it was.  The location shooting is amazingly beautiful, and Palin has a line of dialogue that has always remained in my memory when he is staring at the Swiss Alps.  He remarks on how beautiful it all is, and there must have been some divine hand guiding it.  I think Palin is the most underrated of the Python performers.  He has done very good dramatic work, and has become a global trekker.  From all reports, he is an extremely modest man in person, so maybe he doesn't promote himself as the others might have (at least not as much as Cleese likes to do...the Pythons tease Cleese all the time about that).

334508,A129YBX5BVNW2,6302791243,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 0]","It's 1866 - and crusty old Reverend Francis Ashby (a Fellow Of Oxford University in England) is 46, unmarried and about to depart on his annual holiday to the Swiss Alps to partake of the bracing air and spirit rejuvenating views. His man servant Haskell (a very witty turn by Bryan Pringle) has packed his guide book, boots and other manly things - and breathes a sign of relief because thankfully there'll be no 'dirty women' as he refers to them on this trip. Like Ashby - Haskell is British you see - and the very thought of such things is an anathema to him...But once there - two American ladies Miss Caroline (40) and Miss Elinor Hartley (20) are out on the mountains - when through her binoculars - young Elinor (Trini Alvarado) sees a naked Ashby (Michael Palin) taking a dip in a mountain stream. Something is lit in her heart. And as time passes both in the UK and in Switzerland - his kindness towards her grows (&#34;How else should one behave?&#34;) - and an unlikely but very real love blossoms between them.A young Irish-born girl sent to the USA when she was 5 and adopted by Aunt Caroline - Elinor has been educated, clothed and raised a lady in the best company. But while she's pretty - Elinor is essentially pure and hugely innocent to the world. And her genuinely caring Aunt worries about the headstrong girl wanting a life and love of her own. And at times Aunt Caroline (a superb Connie Booth as a woman of a certain age in a time of uber restraint) even dares to dream of love too with the decent man of learning and classics - Ashby.But despite his best dismissive efforts to repel the ladies and a party of British hikers who spot an opportunity to place their son in Oxford by buttering up the Fellow - soon Ashby is engaged in reluctant walks with the two women - then a dance one Summer evening - and even a brief but beautiful kiss with Elinor. He too it seems is taken by love and suddenly his eyes are opened to a life beyond the confines of dead books and dead languages. But old habits die hard - and conflicted - he heads back to the safety of Founder's Port, Latin Essays and the stuffy rules and regulations of Oxford - where the changing of a Soup Tureen requires a committee meeting.But back home he finds that Rushden - the very elderly President of Oxford is on his last legs (&#34;The Visigoths are at the gates!&#34; he cries out) and a new President will be elected soon. But vying for the position with Ashby is the cunning and morally lecherous Oliver Syme who beds every girl he can in the cottage he owns by the river. Ashby is perceived by all at the famous college to have 'no known moral blemish' and is therefore a front-runner. But then the American ladies come calling to visit Ashby - and needing a place to lodge - Syme lets the cottage by the river to the unsuspecting duo. But as Aunt Caroline and Ashby become closer (walks, dinner and indepth conversation) - young Elinor becomes impatient with Ashby - and in a rash night with Syme involving wet clothes - her virtue is sullied. Ashby now knows he has to make a choice - go for the college prize - or save the girl's reputation...Based on the journals of his real uncle Edward Palin who resigned as an Oxford Fellow in 1866 and raised 7 children with an American woman he met on holidays in Switzerland - Michael Palin's script is co-written with Director Tristram Powell - and is a slow boiler and an utter delight for it. I've always loved this small but perfect film and owned a region 4 Australian DVD of it to have a copy I could watch. George Delerue's string score is beautifully complimentary too in so many scenes.This November 2012 BBC DVD reissue (REGION B/UK - PAL - Barcode 5051561037252) is not without its problems though. It's defaulted to 16 x 9 Anamorphic so it fills the entire screen (no lines to or bottom) and the print from a distance is lovely throughout - it is. But there are times when shimmer and shocking grain and dirt flicks appear (Molina's character giving a lesson to students) - only momentarily though. Overall it's in great shape. It's just that I would have dearly loved to see this gorgeous little movie be given the full restoration makeover - but alas.Subtitles are English for the Hard of Hearing and there are no Extras.The core of the 4 actors - Palin, Alvarado, Booth and Molina are all superb in their parts - as are Alum Armstrong and Bryan Pringle (now sadly lost to us). But it's the gentility of the story that stays. &#34;Her eyes catch mine...I adore her...&#34; a young student tells Ashby who can't concentrate on his studies because he longs for an older woman in the choir he attends. 46-year old Ashby looks out his Oxford window at the courtyard below where the two American ladies are being ushered away by a stuffy college stickler for rules - and knows for the first time in a very long time - what his young student feels so deeply.&#34;American Friends&#34; has always been a minor masterpiece to me - a lovely piece of British cinema. And decent - like the country itself...",5,"""&#8230;I Pleaded We Were Americans&#8230;But That Only Seemed To Make Matters Worse&#8230;"" &#8211; American Friends on DVD",1398297600,"04 24,

334509,A5R3U8ZSFKAL4,6302791243,"Paul Lawrence ""'EJL'""","[0, 0]","Based on a story written by Michael Palin, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Tristram Powell (who directed) this is an achingly understated story of the quintessentially emotionally challenged Englishman finding, part way through his life, that there is something very important in life he may have missed out on.Palin plays Francis Ashby, who is a highly successful scholar at Oxford University and in line for the presidency of it after the current incumbent 'vacates' the position for good. He is an utterly abstemious fellow who comes across as deeply dry and utterly unbothered by his almost complete lack of exposure to society. In fact it practically endears him to the current president of Oxford as he is so beyond suspicion of anything untoward. Each year our Ashby takes himself off on holidays and on this occasion, as he is taking his ease (it is delightful to see the costumes of the gentleman traveller - right down to waistcoat and tie), he is interrupted by two ladies, one played by Connie Booth and the other, younger lady, by Trini Alvarado.Without giving any too much away there is an awakening of some need in Ashby, some part of him that wakes up when in the presence of these two women, that distracts him from his originally planned purpose. The question is of course which of the ladies he is most suited to, what effect it will have on him in the unbelievably staid social environment he comes from and what choices he will make.There is some lovely photography here, some crisp mountain vistas, painfully understated - yet at times high quality - acting from the main protagonists and yet it is the very understated nature of things that truly makes it hard for the audience to connect. It is one thing to be socially stunted or inexperienced but there is so little emotion in any of the characters it is hard to for the any empathy to be drawn. Palin is, to put it bluntly, miscast here as it is so hard to take him seriously in such a drama style of role. He does it well and having come up with the story he is certainly committed to the cause. Perhaps I'm being too hard on him, our views of him being so intertwined with his previous more light hearted exploits. Connie Booth isn't given much to work with, Trini Alvarado manages via her eyes alone (the direction seemingly has left her little choice in facial expression beyond that) to tell some of her characters motivations.In some ways this is a real gem. The tale of a man torn between new ideas and awakenings and his old steady path. But we see so little evidence of it that the opportunity is lost. For fans of British period drama films this it is a safe bet this would be a good addition to your collection.
