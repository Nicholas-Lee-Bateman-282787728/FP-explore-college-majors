They present different situations in the most fun and non-scary way. They did an episode on ""fairy tales"" where the big bad wolf, jack's giant and the three bears were all nice and helpful. The wicked witch was even handled beautifully. They make learning fun and very educational. Different jobs, situations, terrific moral of ""never judge a book by its cover"" and sharing are stressed.

1636932,A3V5F050GVZ56Q,B00BP0LZK8,Dre,"[80, 80]","My girls (ages 3 and 6) love the Bubble Guppies and we have a ton of the episodes on our DVR, including all of the episodes from this DVD. They are always requesting the show. The show is great for its vivid colors and fun songs. It always has a positive message and teaches kids about a variety of things and occupations. You will probably find yourself with the catchy songs stuck in your head. The going outside song is the best.This DVD contains six great Summer and Vacation Themed episodes.  Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:1. The Beach Ball! - Beach episode where Sandy wants to become the Queen of the Beach Ball.2. The Legend of Pinkfoot - The Guppies go camping and hear a campfire story about the Legendary Pinkfoot!3. Bring on the Bugs - The kids learn about all kinds of bugs.  The ""Buggin' Out"" song in this one is really cute.4. The Sizzling Scampinis! - A Circus episode where the kids learn about the different circus acts.5. Bubble Duckies! - A Bird themed episode where the Guppies go to the Bird Air Show.6. Gup, Gup, and Away! - The kids learn about airports and flying.We regularly used the first two Bubble Guppies DVDs for car trips and this one is a great addition to our collection.

1636940,A1M1GL2X80S7JG,B00BP0LZK8,"Randall F. Miller III ""Randy Miller III""","[1, 2]","My three year-old loves this show...and I can tolerate it, which is about as much as you can expect from most pre-school programming.  This DVD contains six vaguely summer-themed episodes, so now's a great time to check them out if you haven't already.  The characters are cute, the animation is well done and there's even a little bit of education thrown in (but not much).  I don't see why 3-5 year-olds need to hear Kidz Bop flavored pop songs, though.  Most of the lyrics and songs seem like they're geared towards kindergartners or even first and second graders.But the real problem here is Nickelodeon's DVD, which is about as lazy an effort as it gets.  The show is presented in full screen (cropped from the original widescreen) and Dolby Stereo (downmixed from the original 5.1 Surround), which I didn't even know was still going on.  Some grandparents might not know or care, but most kids and their (relatively) young parents will either be watching shows like this on a widescreen TV or monitor.  This pan-and-scan cropping pretty much spoils the picture quality and even makes some of the scenes and puzzles hard to follow.  So...a reluctant four stars for the show, but only two stars for the DVD itself.
