350373,A3T8QI2HA950VD,6303011063,50HudsonCommodore,"[0, 0]","Finally, after several years of searching, I found a dvd of this film at less than $150!This is a terrific comedy about a woman whose first husband was fun, passionate & sexy, but a drunk, liar, cheat, con man, gambler, abusive and completely unreliable.  He dies during carnival.  As one of the characters says about him, there wasn't a single cause of death, rather his liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, in fact all of his body, gave out as a result of years of alcohol & partying 24/7.  After an appropriate mourning period, a pharmacist begins courting the young widow.  He is everything that her departed husband wasn't.  He is older, sober, honest, well-to-do, very reliable... and passionless, un-sexy and a general stick-in-the-mud.  Dona Flor marries him because he is a respectable, nice man who professes to love her.  But her new marriage is extremely dull and she begins to recall her late husband and how passionate he was.  In fact she recalls him so strongly that he reappears, but only to her.  She is torn between her love and respect for her second husband and her passion for her first.  Eventually she decides that she can have both.This is a great film based on a great novel by Jorge Amado.  The film immerses the viewer in mid-20th Century Brazilian culture as well as the storyline.  In fact, much of the story line is about the cultural image that the Brazilian male has of himself.  The myth of the American male is personified by John Wayne and the myth of the Brazilian male is personified by the ""malandro"" Vadinho, the first husband.  Now, you have learned a Portuguese word. ""malandro"".  See the film and you will truly understand it.  The same production/direction team and many of the same cast members also made ""Gabriela"" which is likewise based on a terrific novel by Amado.  The first time I saw ""Dona Flor"" 25 years ago, I couldn't understand or speak Portuguese.  If you don't understand Portuguese, don't let that dissuade you;, even with the sub-titles, it is great fun.  And buy a translation of the novels.  You will thank me for turning you on to one of the most wonderful Latin American novelists of the 20th Century.  I am a big fan of the Latin American Spanish language ""Boom"" authors, but Amado is particularly special, in both Portuguese and translation.",5,A great film from a great novel,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,2301,"['Finally', 'several', 'years', 'searching', 'found', 'dvd', 'film', 'less', '150', 'terrific', 'comedy', 'woman', 'first', 'husband', 'was', 'fun', 'passionate', 'sexy', 'drunk', 'liar', 'cheat', 'con', 'man', 'gambler', 'abusive', 'completely', 'unreliable', 'carnival', 'one', 'characters', 'was', ""n't"", 'single', 'cause', 'death', 'rather', 'liver', 'kidneys', 'heart', 'lungs', 'fact', 'body', 'gave', 'out', 'result', 'years', 'alcohol', 'partying', '24/7', 'appropriate', 'mourning', 'period', 'pharmacist', 'courting', 'young', 'widow', 'everything', 'departed', 'husband', 'was', ""n't"", 'older', 'sober', 'honest', 'well-to-do', 'very', 'reliable', 'passionless', 'un-sexy', 'general', 'stick-in-the-mud', 'Dona', 'Flor', 'respectable', 'nice', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'new', 'marriage', 'extremely', 'dull', 'recall', 'late', 'husband', 'how', 'passionate', 'was', 'fact', 'so', 'strongly', 'only', 'torn', 'love', 'respect', 'second', 'husband', 'passion', 'first', 'Eventually', 'can', 'have', 'both.This', 'great', 'film', 'based', 'great', 'novel', 'Jorge', 'Amado', 'film', 'viewer', 'mid-20th', 'Century', 'Brazilian', 'culture', 'as', 'well', 'storyline', 'fact', 'much', 'story', 'line', 'cultural', 'image', 'Brazilian', 'male', 'myth', 'American', 'male', 'personified', 'John', 'Wayne', 'myth', 'Brazilian', 'male', 'personified', 'malandro', 'Vadinho', 'first', 'husband', 'Now', 'have', 'learned', 'Portuguese', 'word', 'malandro', 'See', 'film', 'will', 'truly', 'understand', 'same', 'production/direction', 'team', 'many', 'same', 'cast', 'members', 'also', 'made', 'Gabriela', 'likewise', 'based', 'terrific', 'novel', 'Amado', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Dona', 'Flor', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'speak', 'Portuguese', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Portuguese', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'dissuade', 'even', 'sub-titles', 'great', 'fun', 'buy', 'translation', 'novels', 'will', 'thank', 'turning', 'one', 'most', 'wonderful', 'Latin', 'American', 'novelists', '20th', 'Century', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Latin', 'American', 'Spanish', 'language', 'Boom', 'authors', 'Amado', 'particularly', 'special', 'Portuguese', 'translation']",Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands VHS
350374,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,6303011063,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 3]","Dona Flora is based on the novel by Jorge Amado and directed by Bruno Baretto.  The 1978 film, stars Sonia Braga, well known in the United States.  Set in the 40s in a small town in Brazil is the main character, a beautiful sensual woman named Dona Flora who teaches cooking classes.  The young woman is married to  Vlahinho who is notorious as the real villain you love to hate.  He is a swindler, a drunk, a pervert, a liar, a gambler, a wife beater and, according to Dona Flora, a great sex partner.The movie opens with a colorful and musical town carnival where Vlahindo frolicks with his raunchy displays and drops dead.  Missing him, Dona Flora imagines how wonderful her lovemaking was.  We are then taken back into the world of Vlahindo, his scheming charming ways, with the ability to con the Father of the church.  We see how blatent his flirtatious escapades such as grabbing the rear ends of women while they listen to his wife in her cooking demonstrations.  We also learn about his addiction to gambling, and beating Dona Flor for money.  But, she loooovvves him!Dona Flora remarries the pharmacist, someone a complete departure for Vlahindo.  Teodoro is well-mannered, reputable, plain and somewhat older.  But as time goes by, in a ghostly fashion, Vlahindo show up frequently, always in the nude and Dona Flora succumbs to his playboy sexual antics.This is an entertaining film, and similar to many Latin foreign film, there is lots of nudity and sex scenes that are more restrained with nudity more frequent.  There is fun and music and an array of characters that add to the fun.Similar to this that I recommendLa Vida Conyugal (Married Life), is another Latin film, where a women has sex with other men in hopes that she can urge one of them to kill her husband.......Rizzo",5,"Colorful, musical, and ghostly!",1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,1793,"['Dona', 'Flora', 'based', 'novel', 'Jorge', 'Amado', 'directed', 'Bruno', 'Baretto', '1978', 'film', 'Sonia', 'Braga', 'well', 'known', 'United', 'States', 'Set', '40s', 'small', 'town', 'Brazil', 'main', 'character', 'beautiful', 'sensual', 'woman', 'named', 'Dona', 'Flora', 'who', 'cooking', 'classes', 'young', 'woman', 'married', 'Vlahinho', 'who', 'notorious', 'real', 'villain', 'love', 'hate', 'swindler', 'drunk', 'pervert', 'liar', 'gambler', 'wife', 'beater', 'according', 'Dona', 'Flora', 'great', 'sex', 'partner.The', 'movie', 'colorful', 'musical', 'town', 'carnival', 'where', 'Vlahindo', 'raunchy', 'displays', 'drops', 'dead', 'Missing', 'Dona', 'Flora', 'how', 'wonderful', 'lovemaking', 'was', 'are', 'then', 'taken', 'back', 'world', 'Vlahindo', 'scheming', 'charming', 'ways', 'ability', 'con', 'Father', 'church', 'see', 'how', 'blatent', 'flirtatious', 'escapades', 'such', 'grabbing', 'rear', 'ends', 'women', 'listen', 'wife', 'cooking', 'demonstrations', 'also', 'learn', 'addiction', 'gambling', 'beating', 'Dona', 'Flor', 'money', 'Dona', 'Flora', 'pharmacist', 'someone', 'complete', 'departure', 'Vlahindo', 'Teodoro', 'well-mannered', 'reputable', 'plain', 'somewhat', 'older', 'time', 'ghostly', 'fashion', 'Vlahindo', 'show', 'up', 'frequently', 'always', 'nude', 'Dona', 'Flora', 'succumbs', 'playboy', 'sexual', 'antics.This', 'entertaining', 'film', 'similar', 'many', 'Latin', 'foreign', 'film', 'lots', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'restrained', 'nudity', 'more', 'frequent', 'fun', 'music', 'array', 'characters', 'add', 'fun.Similar', 'recommendLa', 'Vida', 'Conyugal', 'Married', 'Life', 'Latin', 'film', 'where', 'women', 'sex', 'other', 'men', 'hopes', 'can', 'urge', 'one', 'kill', 'husband', '.Rizzo']",Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands VHS

Here it is beautifully  translated to screen with our heroine, Dona Flor, portrayed by the beautiful Sonia Braga and set in Brazil in 1943 complete with period costumes, beautiful food and period music.The story lesiurely unfolds as the viewer comes to understand why it is Dona Flor loves her sexy Vadinho and puts up with his abuse.  After he drops dead during a Carnival samba dressed in drag and wearing a large fake male organ, Dona Flor is inconsolable.  Celibate and desperately missing sex, she finally remarries.  This time her choice (to her mother's delight) is a solid middle-class pharmacist, a good man, loving husband and bassoon player. However, on her honeymoon, Dona Flor discovers to her dismay that something is missing in the bedroom.  Act 3 of our story takes a mystical bent with the undead Vadinho suddenly appearing naked in her bedroom and only Flor can see him.  Death has not changed Vadinho, he still goes around to his old haunts, helps out his gambling friends and favorite prostitutes, all the while trying to make it with his wife who still retains her sexual longings.The movie diverges from the book at the ending and although both work for Dona Flor whom we come to love, I prefer the book ending which resolves the dilemma by demonstrating Flor's emotional growth and good character.  However, find the movie if you can and/or read the book, it is a funny tale with great recipes.
