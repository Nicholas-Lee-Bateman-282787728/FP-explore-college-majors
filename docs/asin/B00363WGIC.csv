1327141,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B00363WGIC,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[3, 3]","I highly recommend the I LOVE LUCY MOVIE DVD for those who boughtI Love Lucy - The Complete First Seasonseries, one season at a time, like I did because I couldn't wait. This is the bonus DVD that was included in the complete setI Love Lucy: The Complete Series, according to my friend who purchased that box set.Since I bought each season, I was kind of miffed that they released the entire seasons as one set, which included this bonus DVD! Anyway, it's great that they allow us fans to buy the DVD separately, rather than buying the entire box set, which would be double-dipping.This DVD contains a special colorized version of ""Lucy Goes To Scotland"" and it looks really nice in color. I wish they did more episodes like this, especially ""Lucy's Italian Movie,"" which would be a hoot to see in color. Maybe they'll painstakingly colorize all the episodes as an option for a future Blu-Ray release? That would convince me to buy.The other offering is the ""I Love Lucy Movie,"" which is three episodes strung together to create one seamless show. Not only does it edit the shows together, but you get to see what it was like for an audience member as you go from outside the DesiLu Studio to inside the sound stage where ""I Love Lucy"" was being tapped. Desi Arnaz comes out and gives a pep talk and then the show begins!The extras also make this DVD worth having for ""Lucy"" fans:=====  EXTRAS  ======* The Ed Wynn Show (02:57-minutes)-- Lucy and Desi make their first television appearance together on Wynn's show, famous for portraying ""Uncle Albert"" in Disney'sMary Poppins (45th Anniversary Special Edition).* Emmy Awards (05:30-minutes)-- Footage of the Emmy Awards before they were televised showing Vivian Vance winning for ""Best Supporting Actress"" and Desi and Lucy accepting for ""Best Comedy Show;"" William Frawley can be seen in the background at the table. Love this retro stuff.* On Set Commercial Featuring John Stephenson (02:15-minutes)-- John Stephenson, spokesman for Philip Morris, is seen in the Ricardo's living room set and introduces sponsor ""Philip Morris."" Second shot (:27-seconds) shows Stephenson at the never-before-seen window by the fireplace in the apartment set. I always wondered what was supposed to be there.* Johnny Roventini (02:38-minutes)-- Pitchman for Philip Morris Cigarettes. ""Call for Philip Morris!"" vintage commercial is included. This clip describes Roventini, how he was discovered, and how many times his image and the famous line was used on I Love Lucy.* Easter Egg-- If you click on the icon that says ""I Love Lucy"" you'll be treated to the animated opening sequence showing a Christmas theme and the sponsor, and that giving a carton of Philip Morris cigarettes would be the perfect gift.So this DVD is definitely worth it if you didn't buy the complete box set of ""I Love Lucy"" and want the bonus disc. But aside from the colorized version of one episode and the movie that shows a little of the audience, plus the bonus extras there isn't anything completely new on this DVD.",5,*Bonus DVD* For Those Who Didn't Buy The Set!,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,3031,"['highly', 'recommend', 'LOVE', 'LUCY', 'MOVIE', 'DVD', 'who', 'boughtI', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Complete', 'First', 'Seasonseries', 'one', 'season', 'time', 'did', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'was', 'included', 'complete', 'setI', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Complete', 'Series', 'according', 'friend', 'who', 'purchased', 'box', 'set.Since', 'bought', 'season', 'was', 'kind', 'miffed', 'released', 'entire', 'seasons', 'one', 'set', 'included', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'Anyway', 'great', 'allow', 'fans', 'buy', 'DVD', 'separately', 'rather', 'buying', 'entire', 'box', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'double-dipping.This', 'DVD', 'special', 'colorized', 'version', 'Lucy', 'Goes', 'Scotland', 'really', 'nice', 'color', 'wish', 'did', 'more', 'episodes', 'especially', 'Lucy', 'Italian', 'Movie', 'would', 'be', 'hoot', 'see', 'color', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'painstakingly', 'colorize', 'episodes', 'option', 'future', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'would', 'convince', 'buy.The', 'other', 'offering', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Movie', 'three', 'episodes', 'strung', 'together', 'create', 'one', 'seamless', 'show', 'Not', 'only', 'edit', 'shows', 'together', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'audience', 'member', 'go', 'DesiLu', 'Studio', 'inside', 'sound', 'stage', 'where', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'was', 'being', 'tapped', 'Desi', 'Arnaz', 'out', 'pep', 'talk', 'then', 'show', 'extras', 'also', 'make', 'DVD', 'worth', 'having', 'Lucy', 'fans', '=====', 'EXTRAS', 'Ed', 'Wynn', 'Show', '02:57-minutes', 'Lucy', 'Desi', 'make', 'first', 'television', 'appearance', 'together', 'Wynn', 'show', 'famous', 'portraying', 'Uncle', 'Albert', ""Disney'sMary"", 'Poppins', '45th', 'Anniversary', 'Special', 'Edition', '*', 'Emmy', 'Awards', '05:30-minutes', 'Footage', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'were', 'televised', 'showing', 'Vivian', 'Vance', 'winning', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Desi', 'Lucy', 'accepting', 'Best', 'Comedy', 'Show', 'William', 'Frawley', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'background', 'table', 'Love', 'retro', 'stuff', '*', 'Set', 'Commercial', 'Featuring', 'John', 'Stephenson', '02:15-minutes', 'John', 'Stephenson', 'spokesman', 'Philip', 'Morris', 'seen', 'Ricardo', 'living', 'room', 'set', 'introduces', 'sponsor', 'Philip', 'Morris', 'Second', 'shot', ':27-seconds', 'Stephenson', 'never-before-seen', 'window', 'fireplace', 'apartment', 'set', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'there', '*', 'Johnny', 'Roventini', '02:38-minutes', 'Pitchman', 'Philip', 'Morris', 'Cigarettes', 'Call', 'Philip', 'Morris', 'vintage', 'commercial', 'included', 'clip', 'Roventini', 'how', 'was', 'discovered', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'image', 'famous', 'line', 'was', 'used', 'Love', 'Lucy', '*', 'Easter', 'Egg', 'click', 'icon', 'Love', 'Lucy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'treated', 'animated', 'opening', 'sequence', 'showing', 'Christmas', 'theme', 'sponsor', 'giving', 'carton', 'Philip', 'Morris', 'cigarettes', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'gift.So', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'worth', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'complete', 'box', 'set', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'want', 'bonus', 'disc', 'aside', 'colorized', 'version', 'one', 'episode', 'movie', 'little', 'audience', 'bonus', 'extras', ""n't"", 'anything', 'completely', 'new', 'DVD']",N/A
