It's a great mystery detective story with many twist andturns and James Coburn is excellent. The video is not the uncut version as statedbut it's worth getting anyway. I love 70's tv movies and if you do too you'll like this.,5,Great 70's mini series!,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,330,"['did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'know', 'saw', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'alwayswanted', 'see', 'again', 'great', 'mystery', 'detective', 'story', 'many', 'twist', 'andturns', 'James', 'Coburn', 'excellent', 'video', 'not', 'uncut', 'version', 'statedbut', 'worth', 'getting', 'anyway', 'love', '70', 'tv', 'movies', 'do', 'too', ""'ll"", 'like']",Dashiell Hammett's The Dain Curse Original Unedited Miniseries  VHS

The movies today are interesting if your curious how many gallons of gas they used to destroy everything standing in the hero's way. Watching James Coburn brought back so many great memories of the movies I really enjoyed during the years The story was confusing at times, but Coburn was there keeping us calm and confident that all would be made clear in the end. He made the movie a great experience. I'm looking for more of his works to watch.",5,James coburn is a breath of fresh air.,1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,494,"['remember', 'movies', 'back', '40s', 'movies', 'today', 'are', 'interesting', 'curious', 'how', 'many', 'gallons', 'gas', 'used', 'destroy', 'everything', 'standing', 'hero', 'way', 'Watching', 'James', 'Coburn', 'brought', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'memories', 'movies', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'years', 'story', 'was', 'confusing', 'times', 'Coburn', 'was', 'keeping', 'calm', 'confident', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'clear', 'end', 'made', 'movie', 'great', 'experience', ""'m"", 'looking', 'more', 'works', 'watch']",Dashiell Hammett's The Dain Curse Original Unedited Miniseries  VHS

Yet I saw part of this on my little 12 inch black and white TV many years ago when it was first released. Missed the rest due to a night job at the university.  What I saw was absolutely astounding and I'm going to buy it as soon as I find it on sale. For 30 years those images have been etched for me. Extraordinarily atmospheric!
