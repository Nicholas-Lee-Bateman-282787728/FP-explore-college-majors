Disney scores another home run with Man of the House, and the comedy grabs you by the throat from the very first scene and never loosens its grip.If you've never seen any Chevy Chase movies (and what's wrong with you, if so?!) then this is definitely the one to see.  He is very, very sarcastic which is my sense of humor too, and he has some of the funniest faces and zingers that you'd ever want to see/hear.  But he has definitely met his match with the kid from Home Improvement, who delivers wisecracks like kids always do.  This kid is definitely going places and is by far my favorite person from Home Improvement, except for maybe Tim Allen and Wilson the neighbor.Farrah Fawcett has never been more gorgeous and whimsical as she is in Man of the House, and what's so funny is that Chevy Chase wants to marry her, but the kid really doesn't want him too.  So it's a lot like Home Alone, except instead of people wanting to burgle the home, this kid wants to keep the intruder (Chevy Chase, ""Oh Heavenly Dog"") away from his mom.  And we can all relate to wanting to keep people away from Farrah Fawcett, so it's a comedy that makes you think.This movie is probably going to make one of your top 10 lists, and it's so funny at times that you might need to excuse yourself from the room.

The film is a classic comedy where Ben does what he can to test the new ""dad-to-be"". In fact, his whole plan is to drive Jack out of his mom's life. The fact is ... his plan backfires.Jack does whatever it takes to win Ben over. He even joins the Indian scouts, a group in which Ben feigns interest, which he expects will send Jack over the edge. Surprisingly, it has the opposite effect, Ben ends up looking forward to the adventures in the wild, especially a planned canoe trip. Unfortunately, it is the one time Jack does not show up ... convincing Ben, Jack is like his dad.Bigger problems loom in th horizon for Jack, who is nearly killed by the son of a mob-type stalker and his buddies who are exacting revenge for having placed his father in jail. The climactic build up and suspense in the film is worth viewing for oneself. This is a family entertainment style film where all the problems are resolved in the end. The film is amusing and makes the viewer feel good. While much of the film is predictable, that is why it does not disappoint the viewer.

389725,A2JYIDH7JIG48H,6303929567,"R. Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[1, 2]","As a Chevy Chase comedy, Man of The House is far from his funniest; however, it works well as a family drama.The story's sort of an inverted ""Courtship of Eddie's Father.""  In this case it's the boy's mother (Farrah Fawcett) who is single, and the boy (Jonathan Taylor Thomas of Home Improvement, Tom and Huck, etc.) is wary of her new fiancee, a prosecutor named Sturges  (Chase).  Still feeling burnt by his ex-dad, the boy tries everything to get rid of the prospective one.  Some of this is funny, like when he paints Sturges's face with Indian war paint that won't come off, and the parts that aren't funny are still interesting and help develop the characters and story.  I think the film is most effective in that it demonstrates the persistence of faith necessary to build a family, as Sturges doesn't give up on the boy, but continues to try to win his friendship after each prank by the boy, and each failure of his own.  Competent acting by Thomas helps the film succeed on this score.The subplot is about a hoodlum Sturges sent to prison, and his son and his thugs trying to get revenge on the prosecutor.  Mostly this is supposed to be funny, but doesn't live up to Chase's usual standards.  However, it does weave a bit of suspense into the story and provides a catalyst for Sturges to finally win over the boy's sympathies, as well as a climax with some action.The supporting cast includes George Wendt (Cheers), who's mostly serious in this role, and Art LeFleur, who's funny as an Indian Guides martinet.If you're looking for a hilarious comedy, don't look here; but if you're in the mood for a light family drama with a well-devoloped message and some humor, Man of the House will foot the bill with one family values caveat:  Chase and Fawcett move in together before they're married.",4,"Decent family drama, not hilarious comedy.",1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,1803,"['Chevy', 'Chase', 'comedy', 'Man', 'House', 'far', 'funniest', 'however', 'well', 'family', 'story', 'sort', 'inverted', 'Courtship', 'Eddie', 'Father', 'case', 'boy', 'mother', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'who', 'single', 'boy', 'Jonathan', 'Taylor', 'Thomas', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'Tom', 'Huck', 'etc', 'wary', 'new', 'fiancee', 'prosecutor', 'named', 'Sturges', 'Chase', 'Still', 'feeling', 'burnt', 'ex-dad', 'boy', 'everything', 'get', 'rid', 'prospective', 'one', 'funny', 'when', 'Sturges', 'face', 'Indian', 'war', 'paint', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'parts', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'are', 'still', 'interesting', 'help', 'develop', 'characters', 'story', 'think', 'film', 'most', 'effective', 'persistence', 'faith', 'necessary', 'build', 'family', 'Sturges', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'boy', 'try', 'win', 'friendship', 'prank', 'boy', 'failure', 'own', 'Competent', 'acting', 'Thomas', 'film', 'succeed', 'score.The', 'subplot', 'hoodlum', 'Sturges', 'sent', 'prison', 'son', 'thugs', 'trying', 'get', 'revenge', 'prosecutor', 'Mostly', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Chase', 'usual', 'standards', 'However', 'weave', 'bit', 'suspense', 'story', 'catalyst', 'Sturges', 'finally', 'win', 'boy', 'sympathies', 'as', 'well', 'climax', 'action.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'George', 'Wendt', 'Cheers', 'who', 'mostly', 'serious', 'role', 'Art', 'LeFleur', 'who', 'funny', 'Indian', 'Guides', 'martinet.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'here', ""'re"", 'mood', 'light', 'family', 'drama', 'well-devoloped', 'message', 'humor', 'Man', 'House', 'will', 'foot', 'bill', 'one', 'family', 'caveat', 'Chase', 'Fawcett', 'move', 'together', ""'re"", 'married']",Man of the House VHS
