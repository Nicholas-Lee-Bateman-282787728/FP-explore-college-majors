The plots pull off more action and blood, but also a more deep look on the characters feelings. Also, the introduction of new characters (and comebacks of old ones) are part of the reason has been so good since the beginning.Every episode is a great episode, because sometimes in a show they are some few episodes you want to forget (maybe because they're too boring, and useless for the main plot), but that's not the case with this show. Every episode is important.I know that only half of the season aired (writing this as of November 10th, the original airing of the ""mid-season"" finale), but I could say is so far so good. I can't wait to see the another half (hopefully something more extreme).

No Digital Copy!!  Sorry, I really don't like Ultraviolet.  I like the fact that a Digital Copy that works with iTunes will show up as a purchased item on your iTunes account and would allow you access forever.  Furthermore, iTunes also allows me to stream via my Apple TV to my big screen.  It all works quite easily.With Ultraviolet, it seems like every studio does something different.  Some movies you can't even download.  Some movies from Sony and the like make you download a multitude of files, like 10 to 20 files for one movie, that aren't recognizable by anything but some Sony player which also has to be downloaded.  I think Flixster does the same thing as I recall.Apple and iTunes/Digital Copy had it all worked out making Digital Copy a wonderful experience and then some of the other movie companies had to deploy these iTunes wannabe's which really kinda suck!Vudu may work great, haven't tried it yet.  Amazon may work great, haven't tried it.  But I have tried Ultraviolet, Sony and Flixster and they stink!  At least offer an iTunes Digital Copy along with Ultraviolet so we can make a choice!Update 9.18.12:  I recently discovered that some, and I stress only some, movies that are on my Ultraviolet account do tie in to my Vudu account.  I forgot I had a Vudu account since I have never used it.  To use my Vudu account I have to buy another compatible streaming device such as a TV, Blu-Ray, or use a video game system, which for some reason, I just have never got into even though I have both the XBox360 and a PS3.  Maybe I will check out the XBox360 option.  I would probably rather use Roku box but Vudu is not supported on Roku!  I throw my request in with countless others for Roku to sign up with Vudu/Walmart to stream their movies!!",5,Better than any Twilight movie by leaps and bounds!!!,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,1958,"['have', 'already', 'seen', 'entire', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'fantastic', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release', 'only', 'comment', 'noticed', 'Season', '3', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'available', 'Ultraviolet', 'No', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'Sorry', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Ultraviolet', 'fact', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'iTunes', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'purchased', 'item', 'iTunes', 'account', 'would', 'allow', 'access', 'forever', 'Furthermore', 'iTunes', 'also', 'stream', 'Apple', 'TV', 'big', 'screen', 'quite', 'easily.With', 'Ultraviolet', 'studio', 'something', 'different', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'download', 'movies', 'Sony', 'like', 'make', 'download', 'multitude', 'files', '10', '20', 'files', 'one', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'recognizable', 'anything', 'Sony', 'player', 'also', 'be', 'downloaded', 'think', 'Flixster', 'same', 'thing', 'recall.Apple', 'iTunes/Digital', 'Copy', 'had', 'worked', 'out', 'making', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'then', 'other', 'movie', 'companies', 'had', 'deploy', 'iTunes', 'wannabe', 'really', 'suck', 'Vudu', 'may', 'work', 'great', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'yet', 'Amazon', 'may', 'work', 'great', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'have', 'tried', 'Ultraviolet', 'Sony', 'Flixster', 'stink', 'least', 'offer', 'iTunes', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'Ultraviolet', 'can', 'make', 'choice', 'Update', '9.18.12', 'recently', 'discovered', 'stress', 'only', 'movies', 'are', 'Ultraviolet', 'account', 'do', 'tie', 'Vudu', 'account', 'forgot', 'had', 'Vudu', 'account', 'have', 'never', 'used', 'use', 'Vudu', 'account', 'have', 'buy', 'compatible', 'streaming', 'device', 'such', 'TV', 'Blu-Ray', 'use', 'video', 'game', 'system', 'reason', 'just', 'have', 'never', 'got', 'even', 'have', 'XBox360', 'PS3', 'Maybe', 'will', 'check', 'out', 'XBox360', 'option', 'would', 'probably', 'rather', 'use', 'Roku', 'box', 'Vudu', 'not', 'supported', 'Roku', 'throw', 'request', 'countless', 'others', 'Roku', 'sign', 'up', 'Vudu/Walmart', 'stream', 'movies']","Vampire Diaries, The:S3 (DVD)"

1433733,A5LHEWTYFQVWP,B004YM6JLO,J. Wright,"[0, 1]","Let me count the ways -- or, on second thought, maybe not.  My Google search for ""vampires in movies and books"" yielded 15 million entries.  Suffice it to say that these creatures are lodged deeply in our collective unconscious.  The ""Twilight"" movies alone have so far grossed an astonishing 3 billion dollars worldwide.  Television's Vampire Diaries has gone on to Season 4, and True Blood to Season 6.  What can account for the extraordinary appeal that these stories seem to have for countless hordes of teenage girls?  I am not part of that demographic, but will nonetheless try to evaluate these three shows.  If I should by chance tread on your favorite, please don't take offense.Vampire Diaries has many flaws, but none of them are quite fatal.  The most glaring of these flaws is this:  The producers seem to have scoured Hollywood to find every available pretty boy with six-pack abs (a specialty of this network), but, alas, most of them are at best unconvincing actors.  The good news, however, is this show's endearing fidelity to the basic High School Vampire mythology.  Also, these scripts are much better written than the clunky twaddle that passes for dialogue in the Twilight films.  Of course, as all true genre fans know, the boy vampire will try heroically to deny his evil nature in order to win his girl's love.  This struggle never ends, but will always be continued next week, and always include a touching final scene accompanied by a sweet pop song.  I may sound a bit cynical here, but, in fact, these moments usually bring a tear to my eye.Possibly the most surprising and curious thing about this show may be its bizarre chastity.  Having hired all those comely actors, the producers never let us see them naked, even when having sex.  This is in contrast to True Blood, which tends to take nudity and sex to campy excess.  So what is it about Vampire Diaries that makes it work?  Here's one suggestion:  The photography and direction are very fine and every shot is beautifully illuminated against dark shadows like a Vermeer painting.  (True Blood, by contrast, tends to look quite gaudy).  This subtlety of design and lighting suits these ancient creatures.Finally, there is actor Ian Sommerhalder, who plays the bad brother Damon (or is he the good brother?).  While his mugging, smirking, and waggling eyebrows should certainly be dialed back a bit, he completely steals every scene he is in.  Perhaps he is the series' secret weapon.In sum, then, the classic simplicity of Vampire Diaries easily beats the overwrought extravagance of True Blood and the lame dialogue of the Twilight series, and earns my vote as the best of the genre.  I will be back for the next season.",3,How do we love vampires?,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,2709,"['Let', 'count', 'ways', 'second', 'thought', 'maybe', 'not', 'Google', 'search', 'vampires', 'movies', 'books', 'yielded', '15', 'million', 'entries', 'Suffice', 'say', 'creatures', 'are', 'lodged', 'deeply', 'collective', 'unconscious', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'alone', 'have', 'so', 'far', 'grossed', 'astonishing', '3', 'billion', 'dollars', 'worldwide', 'Television', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'gone', 'Season', '4', 'True', 'Blood', 'Season', '6', 'What', 'can', 'account', 'extraordinary', 'appeal', 'stories', 'seem', 'have', 'countless', 'hordes', 'teenage', 'girls', 'am', 'not', 'part', 'demographic', 'will', 'nonetheless', 'try', 'evaluate', 'three', 'shows', 'should', 'chance', 'tread', 'favorite', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'offense.Vampire', 'Diaries', 'many', 'flaws', 'none', 'are', 'quite', 'fatal', 'most', 'glaring', 'flaws', 'producers', 'seem', 'have', 'scoured', 'Hollywood', 'find', 'available', 'pretty', 'boy', 'six-pack', 'abs', 'specialty', 'network', 'alas', 'most', 'are', 'best', 'unconvincing', 'actors', 'good', 'news', 'however', 'show', 'endearing', 'fidelity', 'basic', 'High', 'School', 'Vampire', 'mythology', 'Also', 'scripts', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'written', 'clunky', 'twaddle', 'dialogue', 'Twilight', 'films', 'course', 'true', 'genre', 'fans', 'know', 'boy', 'vampire', 'will', 'try', 'heroically', 'deny', 'evil', 'nature', 'order', 'win', 'girl', 'love', 'struggle', 'never', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'continued', 'next', 'week', 'always', 'include', 'touching', 'final', 'scene', 'accompanied', 'sweet', 'pop', 'song', 'may', 'sound', 'bit', 'cynical', 'here', 'fact', 'moments', 'usually', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye.Possibly', 'most', 'surprising', 'curious', 'thing', 'show', 'may', 'be', 'bizarre', 'chastity', 'Having', 'hired', 'comely', 'actors', 'producers', 'never', 'let', 'see', 'naked', 'even', 'when', 'having', 'sex', 'contrast', 'True', 'Blood', 'take', 'nudity', 'sex', 'campy', 'excess', 'what', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'work', 'Here', 'one', 'suggestion', 'photography', 'direction', 'are', 'very', 'fine', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'illuminated', 'dark', 'shadows', 'Vermeer', 'painting', 'True', 'Blood', 'contrast', 'look', 'quite', 'gaudy', 'subtlety', 'design', 'lighting', 'suits', 'ancient', 'creatures.Finally', 'actor', 'Ian', 'Sommerhalder', 'who', 'bad', 'brother', 'Damon', 'good', 'brother', 'mugging', 'smirking', 'waggling', 'eyebrows', 'should', 'certainly', 'be', 'dialed', 'back', 'bit', 'completely', 'scene', 'Perhaps', 'series', 'secret', 'weapon.In', 'sum', 'then', 'classic', 'simplicity', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'easily', 'overwrought', 'extravagance', 'True', 'Blood', 'lame', 'dialogue', 'Twilight', 'series', 'vote', 'best', 'genre', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'next', 'season']","Vampire Diaries, The:S3 (DVD)"

The whole ""Doppelganger"" thing with Elena is beyond silly, but the dumbest plotline by far has to do with Alaric. Just HOW many times is this man going to die? His sudden Jekyll/Hyde alter ego is ridiculous when there was no build-up to it at all. Besides that, there are so many other minor plotlines going on with each character that the show totally loses it's cohesiveness and tension. It's very hard as a viewer to stay invested and interested in the characters when you can barely keep track of who is a vampire, werewolf, or hybrid THIS time, since so many people are being changed into supernatural beings. Take the character of Tyler, who started out as a normal 17-year-old boy, but THEN becomes a werewolf, and THEN becomes a werewolf/vampire hybrid....seriously? Clearly the writers just gave up early on in the season! I'm surprised they didn't whip up a plot with a time-machine...it wouldn't be any stupider than the rest of the plotlines in this season. Somebody needs to tell the writers that an excessively convoluted plotline does not make a show more exciting, - it only makes that show more annoying. The key to good writing is this maxim: ""A simple story, told well"". The writers need to go back to focusing on the love triangle between Damon, Elena and Stefan without all of this other garbage thrown in.

I watched Twilight up until the last movie when it just got bizarre. I was hoping this series would be different than the others--more captivating with less gratuitous sex and teenage drama. And it was in the first two seasons. It was by far the best vampire series I had seen. But then by the third season it began to get old and weird.The plot was advancing and then digressing as it traveled in circles to the point that I said enough already. Elana and Stephan are following the same path as Sookie and Bill in True Blood. They love each other so much that one cannot live with out the other, and then they are cool. She finds herself attracted to his vampire brother, and then she's back hot for Stephan, but he doesn't want her. Oh wait, yes he does, but she is not sure about him. Klaus is evil and then he isn't. We have to kill the originals, and then when we have them, we let them go because we can't kill them without hurting our friends. There was so much back and forth with all of this that my brain got whiplash watching it.

1433760,A3JHIJXC94LU1N,B004YM6JLO,MELANIE,"[3, 3]","I absolutely love this show! I put off watching it for a long time, all the while enjoying the Twilight series, Trueblood, Ghost Whisperer, Supernatural and similar shows. I was hooked after just a few episodes. And now, even into the 3rd season, each episode continues to shock me, with (spoiler alert) the most recent surprise being that of Tyler's uncle Mason returning.One problem I have with season 3 is when in the world is Elena and Damon going to hook up? Am I the only viewer has been waiting for this to happen for the past year now? Stefan, Elena and Damon and the 3 main characters and the show IS advertised as the ""love triangle"" being the main theme, so, how is it they can drag it out for this long and NOT give Damon and Elena a chance? I watch each episode just waiting for something to happen, and while it is always quite entertaining and I love the twists and surprises at the end of each episode, I really think they are dragging it out between Elena and Damon for too long. Also, I would LOVE to see how Stefan, now with no humanity, would react to seeing Elena with Damon? Even without his humanity, I know that a core part of him still loves Elena, compelled or not.My absolute FAVORITE part of Season 3 is the love affair with Tyler and Caroline. Caroline's character has evolved from a snobby, whiny, shallow, princess type, into a smart, considerate, intelligent and interesting character. Tyler has also evolved into someone more fun to watch as well. I think their sex scene in episode 2 or 3, was one of the best sex scenes I have ever seen. I love the chemistry they have and I hope they stay together and it works out. Someone needs to turn Matt into something, anything, because his character is just too boring. He's been sad since the first show, first season. Geez, give the guy something to live for already! Through it all though, I love Damon. Ian Somerhalder is just breathtakingly gorgeous! If I were Elena I'd be throwing myself at him by now. How many times can a guy save your life before you at least throw him a bone?!!The one person I really miss is Jenna. I don't know how they could bring her back, but, if they bring anyone back, I wish it would be her. She brought a certain element to the show that doesn't exist without her. The show's different with her gone. I admit they didn't give her character a whole lot to work with, but she was a great actor and I enjoyed watching her. She was quite pretty as well. I'd like to see Anna come back to life too. All the different elements involved with each character make this show superb. Any 1-2 characters in the show have so much going in in their own lives, they could almost have a show of their own. So, when you combine all of these characters, you have an extremely compelling (no pun intended) show that I just can NOT get enough of!!",5,New Twists every WEEK!,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,2841,"['absolutely', 'love', 'show', 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'long', 'time', 'while', 'enjoying', 'Twilight', 'series', 'Trueblood', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer', 'Supernatural', 'similar', 'shows', 'was', 'hooked', 'just', 'few', 'episodes', 'now', 'even', '3rd', 'season', 'episode', 'shock', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'most', 'recent', 'surprise', 'being', 'Tyler', 'uncle', 'Mason', 'returning.One', 'problem', 'have', 'season', '3', 'when', 'world', 'Elena', 'Damon', 'going', 'hook', 'up', 'only', 'viewer', 'been', 'waiting', 'happen', 'past', 'year', 'now', 'Stefan', 'Elena', 'Damon', '3', 'main', 'characters', 'show', 'advertised', 'love', 'triangle', 'being', 'main', 'theme', 'so', 'how', 'can', 'drag', 'out', 'long', 'NOT', 'give', 'Damon', 'Elena', 'chance', 'watch', 'episode', 'just', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'always', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'love', 'twists', 'surprises', 'end', 'episode', 'really', 'think', 'are', 'dragging', 'out', 'Elena', 'Damon', 'too', 'long', 'Also', 'would', 'LOVE', 'see', 'how', 'Stefan', 'now', 'humanity', 'would', 'react', 'seeing', 'Elena', 'Damon', 'Even', 'humanity', 'know', 'core', 'part', 'still', 'Elena', 'compelled', 'not.My', 'absolute', 'FAVORITE', 'part', 'Season', '3', 'love', 'affair', 'Tyler', 'Caroline', 'Caroline', 'character', 'evolved', 'snobby', 'whiny', 'shallow', 'princess', 'type', 'smart', 'considerate', 'intelligent', 'interesting', 'character', 'Tyler', 'also', 'evolved', 'someone', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'sex', 'scene', 'episode', '2', '3', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'sex', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'love', 'chemistry', 'have', 'hope', 'stay', 'together', 'out', 'Someone', 'turn', 'Matt', 'something', 'anything', 'character', 'just', 'too', 'boring', 'been', 'sad', 'first', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'Geez', 'give', 'guy', 'something', 'live', 'already', 'love', 'Damon', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'just', 'breathtakingly', 'gorgeous', 'were', 'Elena', ""'d"", 'be', 'throwing', 'now', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'guy', 'save', 'life', 'least', 'throw', 'bone', 'one', 'person', 'really', 'miss', 'Jenna', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'could', 'bring', 'back', 'bring', 'anyone', 'back', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'brought', 'certain', 'element', 'show', ""n't"", 'exist', 'show', 'different', 'gone', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'character', 'whole', 'lot', 'work', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'was', 'quite', 'pretty', 'as', 'well', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'Anna', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'too', 'different', 'elements', 'involved', 'character', 'make', 'show', 'superb', '1-2', 'characters', 'show', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'own', 'lives', 'could', 'almost', 'have', 'show', 'own', 'So', 'when', 'combine', 'characters', 'have', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'pun', 'intended', 'show', 'just', 'can', 'NOT', 'get', 'enough']","Vampire Diaries, The:S3 (DVD)"
