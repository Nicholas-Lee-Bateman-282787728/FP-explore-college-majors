There were 4 stories and I fell asleep on one. I did really like the last story with Camryn Mannheim the best.  The first was just okay and I hate to say that about a movie Kate Capshaw is in.  But this is why I always rent first. If I like a film, I'm more inclined to buy it.

669875,A1NRCQL2A6PVAO,B00005NRNS,"""rainboknows""","[2, 4]","This mini series is not what you rent for a night in with the girls...or a date.  With a running time of about 4 hours, it's more a crash course in women's issues than a night of entertainment. Each segment does a good job of addressing some trial that comes with womanhood, but at times it feels like the story will never hit its climax.  With such a bright cast, it's surprising that the acting can get quite atrocious.  The film has its purpose and fills its role in addressing the troubles faced by women. Watching it just requires patience and a lot of free time.Now, if you're thinking of renting for the lesbian content, things get a little brighter. When Elle Macpherson gets into it with another woman, how can you go wrong?  The action is a little canned but there are some scenes worth watching more than once. If you're willing to spring for a rental with just an hour of lesbian content, it's worth watching.  Even if it is with the sound off.Bottom LineCuddles: **Kleenex: *Hotness: ****Laughs:  ***Quality: ***Due to the length, it's best to borrow",3,Nice coverage of issues but not a lot of fun,1063411200,"09 13, 2003",2003,1063,"['mini', 'series', 'not', 'what', 'rent', 'night', 'girls', 'date', 'running', 'time', 'about', '4', 'hours', 'more', 'crash', 'course', 'women', 'issues', 'night', 'entertainment', 'segment', 'good', 'job', 'addressing', 'trial', 'womanhood', 'times', 'story', 'will', 'never', 'hit', 'climax', 'bright', 'cast', 'surprising', 'acting', 'can', 'get', 'quite', 'atrocious', 'film', 'purpose', 'role', 'addressing', 'troubles', 'faced', 'women', 'Watching', 'just', 'patience', 'lot', 'free', 'time.Now', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'renting', 'lesbian', 'content', 'things', 'get', 'little', 'brighter', 'When', 'Elle', 'Macpherson', 'woman', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'action', 'little', 'canned', 'are', 'scenes', 'watching', 'more', 'once', ""'re"", 'willing', 'spring', 'rental', 'just', 'hour', 'lesbian', 'content', 'worth', 'watching', 'Even', 'sound', 'off.Bottom', 'LineCuddles', '**Kleenex', '*Hotness', '****Laughs', '***Quality', '***Due', 'length', 'best', 'borrow']",A Girl Thing
669876,AFLTHO3MB4825,B00005NRNS,Robert J. Willert,"[14, 22]","I am a big fan of movies whether they are centered on men or women, or both. Good writing is essential anytime. Let me say that if you are interested in viewing films about lesbians, take a look at the heart-warming DESERT HEARTS, directed by Donna Deitch. BOUND is highly regarded by most critics, and GIA, starring Angelie Jolie (before her Lara Croft days), is excellent. THE HOURS which features an award-winning performance by Nicole Kidman should be required watching, and IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK. Both films are about women. Both are exceptional.But if you insist on watching this over-rated, over-long mess about a psychiatrist (Stockard Channing) who conducts sessions with various women (Elle MacPherson, Glenn Headley, Lynn Whitfield and Camryn Manheim) who have stories to tell, be my guest, but you have been warned.The most popular segment among (male) viewers is Elle MacPherson's story about her relationship with a bi-sexual woman (Kate Capshaw). I could never understand what either woman saw in each other. The one sexual encounter between them is a flat-out disappointment (watch how Deitch skillfully directs her actresses in DESERT HEARTS). The characters are not allowed to come alive. Maybe the director felt uncomfortable directing a story about homosexuality. Maybe she shouldn't have (chances are this was the key segment that sold the network - this I have no doubt - so they had to leave it in). And as the opening segment it should have blown us away. It didn't.The sisters segment was really much ado about nothing. I didn't care if they inherited the money or not because I didn't care about any of the sisters - the ending was totally ridiculous.Lynn Whitfield, Mia Farrow, Linda Hamilton are capable actresses, so what went wrong? What are they doing in this TERRIBLE segment about Whitfield's cheating husband (Scott Bakula at his sniveling best). I won't reveal the 'triangle' that involves Hamilton and Farrow, but don't expect too much.Finally, Camryn Manheim appears as a demented woman who seeks advise from psychiatrist Channing. Eventually she decides to take her and others hostage in one of the most unbelievably bad hostage segments I have ever seen. Manheim waves a gun in everybody's face for what seems an eternity (what a drag). And when we do get to the 'climax'...!!!And what of Channing's character? About all we know about her is that she likes two cups of coffee in the morning and has conversations with a wise-cracking coffee store manager. Maybe Channing, who is a fine actress, had other ideas when she signed on for this mess.The actors are all wasted here. Bakula and in a cameo, Brent Spiner, are reduced to rubble. It is clear A GIRL THING is about women's issues that involve mostly women. Lesbianism, sisters not getting along, cheating husbands (and that secret love triangle) and crackpot patients. Could've had something here, but it wasn't to be.For those who feel it is about time somebody made a movie about women, think again. Aside from the far superior films I have already mentioned (i.e., far superior to this trash), SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, THE PIANO, MOULIN ROUGE!, CROUCHING TIGER..., and so many other films that feature leading roles for women.I love these movies because they have substance. Even THE TERMINATOR has a strong female lead (again, Linda Hamilton). Men will be men, and women will be women. This is true. But where there is a LETHAL WEAPON, there is also FRANCES (Jessica Lange) or SOPHIE'S CHOICE (Meryl Streep) to balance it out.There is indeed a grave lack of good filmmaking today, in films and on TV. This is not news. Bad filmmakers get away with just about anything today. This is exactly what has happened with the director of A GIRL THING. She has tried to get away with passing off A GIRL THING as something with real substance, when all it really is is another attempt at shooting for ratings. A GIRL THING is a fraud. It couldn't be anything else.",2,Over-long soap operatic mess...,1054857600,"06 6, 2003",2003,3954,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'movies', 'are', 'centered', 'men', 'women', 'Good', 'writing', 'essential', 'anytime', 'Let', 'say', 'are', 'interested', 'viewing', 'films', 'lesbians', 'take', 'look', 'heart-warming', 'DESERT', 'HEARTS', 'directed', 'Donna', 'Deitch', 'BOUND', 'highly', 'regarded', 'most', 'critics', 'GIA', 'starring', 'Angelie', 'Jolie', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'days', 'excellent', 'THE', 'HOURS', 'award-winning', 'performance', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'watching', 'IF', 'THESE', 'WALLS', 'COULD', 'TALK', 'films', 'are', 'women', 'are', 'exceptional.But', 'insist', 'watching', 'over-rated', 'over-long', 'mess', 'psychiatrist', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'who', 'sessions', 'various', 'women', 'Elle', 'MacPherson', 'Glenn', 'Headley', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'who', 'have', 'stories', 'tell', 'be', 'guest', 'have', 'been', 'warned.The', 'most', 'popular', 'segment', 'male', 'viewers', 'Elle', 'MacPherson', 'story', 'relationship', 'bi-sexual', 'woman', 'Kate', 'Capshaw', 'could', 'never', 'understand', 'what', 'woman', 'saw', 'other', 'one', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'flat-out', 'disappointment', 'watch', 'how', 'Deitch', 'skillfully', 'actresses', 'DESERT', 'HEARTS', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'come', 'alive', 'Maybe', 'director', 'felt', 'uncomfortable', 'directing', 'story', 'homosexuality', 'Maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'chances', 'are', 'was', 'key', 'segment', 'sold', 'network', 'have', 'doubt', 'so', 'had', 'leave', 'opening', 'segment', 'should', 'have', 'blown', 'away', 'sisters', 'segment', 'was', 'really', 'much', 'ado', 'nothing', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'inherited', 'money', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'sisters', 'ending', 'was', 'totally', 'ridiculous.Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'are', 'capable', 'actresses', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'TERRIBLE', 'segment', 'Whitfield', 'cheating', 'husband', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'sniveling', 'best', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', ""'triangle"", 'Hamilton', 'Farrow', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much.Finally', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'demented', 'woman', 'who', 'advise', 'psychiatrist', 'Channing', 'Eventually', 'take', 'others', 'hostage', 'one', 'most', 'unbelievably', 'bad', 'hostage', 'segments', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Manheim', 'gun', 'everybody', 'face', 'what', 'eternity', 'what', 'drag', 'when', 'do', 'get', ""'climax"", 'what', 'Channing', 'character', 'know', 'two', 'cups', 'coffee', 'morning', 'conversations', 'wise-cracking', 'coffee', 'store', 'manager', 'Maybe', 'Channing', 'who', 'fine', 'actress', 'had', 'other', 'ideas', 'when', 'signed', 'mess.The', 'actors', 'are', 'wasted', 'here', 'Bakula', 'cameo', 'Brent', 'Spiner', 'are', 'reduced', 'rubble', 'clear', 'A', 'GIRL', 'THING', 'women', 'issues', 'involve', 'mostly', 'women', 'Lesbianism', 'sisters', 'not', 'getting', 'along', 'cheating', 'husbands', 'secret', 'love', 'triangle', 'crackpot', 'patients', 'Could', ""'ve"", 'had', 'something', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'be.For', 'who', 'feel', 'time', 'somebody', 'made', 'movie', 'women', 'think', 'again', 'Aside', 'far', 'superior', 'films', 'have', 'already', 'mentioned', 'i.e.', 'far', 'superior', 'trash', 'SENSE', 'AND', 'SENSIBILITY', 'THE', 'PIANO', 'MOULIN', 'ROUGE', 'CROUCHING', 'TIGER', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'feature', 'leading', 'roles', 'women.I', 'movies', 'have', 'substance', 'Even', 'TERMINATOR', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'again', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Men', 'will', 'be', 'men', 'women', 'will', 'be', 'women', 'true', 'where', 'LETHAL', 'WEAPON', 'also', 'FRANCES', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'SOPHIE', 'CHOICE', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'balance', 'out.There', 'indeed', 'grave', 'lack', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'today', 'films', 'TV', 'not', 'news', 'Bad', 'filmmakers', 'get', 'away', 'just', 'anything', 'today', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'director', 'A', 'GIRL', 'THING', 'tried', 'get', 'away', 'passing', 'off', 'GIRL', 'THING', 'something', 'real', 'substance', 'when', 'really', 'attempt', 'shooting', 'ratings', 'GIRL', 'THING', 'fraud', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'anything', 'else']",A Girl Thing
