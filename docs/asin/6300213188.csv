Thought provoking and exciting, this is definitely a vital part of any serious Star trek collection.This episode is the first (and one of the few) episodes to use a shuttle craft.",5,Spock in Command,988761600,"05 2, 2001",2001,413,"['Spock', 'more', 'commanding', 'ship', 'following', 'logical', 'procedure.This', 'episode', 'lots', 'action', 'suspense', 'interpersonal', 'tension', 'Spock', 'crew', 'Kirk', 'temporary', 'commander', 'Thought', 'provoking', 'exciting', 'definitely', 'vital', 'part', 'serious', 'Star', 'trek', 'collection.This', 'episode', 'first', 'one', 'few', 'episodes', 'use', 'shuttle', 'craft']",N/A
207722,A1F7U2TQHO3A8J,6300213188,Brian Overland,"[0, 0]","Spock's first outing as commanding officer (this time of a shuttlecraft mission gone horribly wrong) is so painful that it nearly ends in mutiny. At least Scotty behaves as you'd expect a loyal officer to behave. TV's Don Marshall accuses Spock of being ""a machine,"" and McCoy is on hand, as usual, to remind Spock that he's inhuman. In real life, Nimoy was more popular than Shatner, both with the cast (plays nice with others) and the fans. But when his character had to take over, humans often seemed to resent his Vulcan blood. (Compare: The Tholian Web, The Paradise Syndrome)When the shuttlecraft is forced to land, Spock and crew encounter giant Neanderthals in costumes so cheap they make ""The Outer Limits"" and ""Lost in Space"" look good... and that's really saying something!! The creatures attack mindlessly, somewhat against the spirit of Trek, although it is possible that they were simply defending their territory. Predictably, some expendable crewmen in red shirts bite the dust, making some of Spock's decisions (who has to stay on the planet?) noticeably easier.There are a couple of minor strong points: 1) Spock's utterance of the line, ""There are always alternatives,"" which would resurface in the movie Star Trek II, and 2) the last scene. Shatner's delivery of the zinger ""Mr. Spock, you're a stubborn man,"" is priceless. Although I always wonder if you're a ""man"" if you're not 100% homo sapien. Let's say he's a stubborn Vulcan. On second thought, no, it doesn't have the same ring to it.For this episode, Kirk is stuck back on the Enterprise, giving Shatner, for a change, less to do than usual. But he has several scenes arguing with a Federation commissioner who wants Kirk to abandon the search for the shuttlecraft. The commissioner is so annoying, it's a wonder Kirk doesn't shove him out an airlock.",3,Spock it To Me,1184803200,"07 19, 2007",2007,1830,"['Spock', 'first', 'outing', 'commanding', 'officer', 'time', 'shuttlecraft', 'mission', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'so', 'painful', 'nearly', 'mutiny', 'least', 'Scotty', 'behaves', ""'d"", 'expect', 'loyal', 'officer', 'behave', 'TV', 'Don', 'Marshall', 'Spock', 'being', 'machine', 'McCoy', 'hand', 'usual', 'remind', 'Spock', 'inhuman', 'real', 'life', 'Nimoy', 'was', 'more', 'popular', 'Shatner', 'cast', 'plays', 'nice', 'others', 'fans', 'when', 'character', 'had', 'take', 'over', 'humans', 'often', 'seemed', 'resent', 'Vulcan', 'blood', 'Compare', 'Tholian', 'Web', 'Paradise', 'Syndrome', 'When', 'shuttlecraft', 'forced', 'land', 'Spock', 'crew', 'encounter', 'giant', 'Neanderthals', 'costumes', 'so', 'cheap', 'make', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'Lost', 'Space', 'look', 'good', 'really', 'saying', 'something', 'creatures', 'attack', 'mindlessly', 'somewhat', 'spirit', 'Trek', 'possible', 'were', 'simply', 'defending', 'territory', 'Predictably', 'expendable', 'crewmen', 'red', 'shirts', 'dust', 'making', 'Spock', 'decisions', 'who', 'stay', 'planet', 'noticeably', 'are', 'couple', 'minor', 'strong', 'points', '1', 'Spock', 'utterance', 'line', 'are', 'always', 'alternatives', 'would', 'resurface', 'movie', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', '2', 'last', 'scene', 'Shatner', 'delivery', 'zinger', 'Mr.', 'Spock', ""'re"", 'stubborn', 'man', 'priceless', 'always', 'wonder', ""'re"", 'man', ""'re"", 'not', '100', '%', 'homo', 'sapien', 'Let', 'say', 'stubborn', 'Vulcan', 'second', 'thought', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'ring', 'it.For', 'episode', 'Kirk', 'stuck', 'back', 'Enterprise', 'giving', 'Shatner', 'change', 'less', 'do', 'usual', 'several', 'scenes', 'arguing', 'Federation', 'commissioner', 'who', 'Kirk', 'abandon', 'search', 'shuttlecraft', 'commissioner', 'so', 'annoying', 'wonder', 'Kirk', ""n't"", 'shove', 'out', 'airlock']",N/A
207723,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6300213188,Charles Ashbacher,"[1, 1]","While there is some interesting action, I dislike this episode on a visceral level. Through the unforeseen actions of a quasar-like phenomenon, the Enterprise shuttlecraft Galileo is thrown wildly off course and crash-lands on a planet. Spock is in command and the other crewmembers are Scotty, McCoy, Lieutenant Boma, a female yeoman and two other expendable crewmen. The Galileo group begins to reconnoiter the surface and almost immediately come under attack from large, humanoid creatures. One of the expendables is quickly killed and almost immediately, Boma and McCoy start to criticize Spock for being more interested in the spear than the death of a fellow crewman.This criticism continues, as Spock refuses to kill the humanoids, hoping to frighten them off with measured, rather than fatal phaser fire. The humanoids do not react as Spock had predicted and tensions aboard the Galileo reach the point of near mutiny when another of the expendables is killed. They finally manage to lift off the surface, and even as it appears that they will all die within minutes, McCoy cannot resist giving Spock one more verbal jab.Meanwhile, there is a level of hostility aboard the Enterprise as well. It is carrying a supply of medicine that will avert a plague that must be delivered on time. A Federation high commissioner supervising the delivery objects to the Enterprise searching for the Galileo. He and Kirk go at it, and while the commissioner is right to insist that they make their rendezvous appointment, his manner is extremely annoying and counterproductive.Once the Galileo achieves a temporary orbit, Spock releases the remaining fuel and ignites it, creating a flare-like signal that is seen by the Enterprise. At the very last second before the Galileo is destroyed by atmospheric friction, the remaining five-crew members are beamed aboard the Enterprise.There are several reasons why I don't like this episode. The first is the amount of insubordination towards Spock exhibited by the remaining members of the crew. While they may not agree with his reasoning or even like the way Vulcans act, Spock is their commanding officer and their criticisms are unbecoming Star Fleet personnel. The only times in the series when crewmembers question their commanding officer is when Spock is in charge. McCoy disagrees with Kirk, but he never questions his command decisions. In the episode ""The Doomsday Machine"", when an obviously disturbed Commodore Decker takes command of the Enterprise, the crew follows his orders, which almost destroys the ship.When the first expendable crewman is killed and the others start criticizing Spock, they are also not reacting as Star Fleet personnel would. Part of their training would be as soldiers, and a soldier would not react to the unexpected death of a comrade by criticizing their superior officer.Finally, all of the other crewmembers, including McCoy, are in favor of simply killing the humanoid creatures. This violates the fundamental principle of non-interference, at the time; they have no idea how intelligent the creatures are. In such a situation, they can kill only when their lives are directly at risk. Therefore, Spock's statements and commands are more in line with Federation law than the urgings of his shipmates, which are quite barbaric. In ""A Private Little War"" Spock is severely shot, yet they still do not use their phasers to defend themselves. This is much more in keeping with the ethics of the Federation when dealing with other beings on their world.",3,Six of the seven do not react like Star Fleet personnel,1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,3534,"['interesting', 'action', 'dislike', 'episode', 'visceral', 'level', 'unforeseen', 'actions', 'quasar-like', 'phenomenon', 'Enterprise', 'shuttlecraft', 'Galileo', 'thrown', 'wildly', 'course', 'crash-lands', 'planet', 'Spock', 'command', 'other', 'crewmembers', 'are', 'Scotty', 'McCoy', 'Lieutenant', 'Boma', 'female', 'yeoman', 'two', 'other', 'expendable', 'crewmen', 'Galileo', 'group', 'reconnoiter', 'surface', 'almost', 'immediately', 'come', 'attack', 'large', 'humanoid', 'creatures', 'One', 'expendables', 'quickly', 'killed', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Boma', 'McCoy', 'start', 'criticize', 'Spock', 'being', 'more', 'interested', 'spear', 'death', 'fellow', 'crewman.This', 'criticism', 'Spock', 'kill', 'humanoids', 'hoping', 'frighten', 'off', 'measured', 'rather', 'fatal', 'phaser', 'fire', 'humanoids', 'do', 'not', 'react', 'Spock', 'had', 'predicted', 'tensions', 'Galileo', 'reach', 'point', 'mutiny', 'when', 'expendables', 'killed', 'finally', 'manage', 'lift', 'off', 'surface', 'even', 'will', 'die', 'minutes', 'McCoy', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'giving', 'Spock', 'one', 'more', 'verbal', 'jab.Meanwhile', 'level', 'hostility', 'Enterprise', 'as', 'well', 'carrying', 'supply', 'medicine', 'will', 'avert', 'plague', 'must', 'be', 'delivered', 'time', 'Federation', 'high', 'commissioner', 'supervising', 'delivery', 'Enterprise', 'searching', 'Galileo', 'Kirk', 'go', 'commissioner', 'right', 'insist', 'make', 'rendezvous', 'appointment', 'manner', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'counterproductive.Once', 'Galileo', 'temporary', 'orbit', 'Spock', 'remaining', 'fuel', 'creating', 'flare-like', 'signal', 'seen', 'Enterprise', 'very', 'last', 'second', 'Galileo', 'destroyed', 'atmospheric', 'friction', 'remaining', 'five-crew', 'members', 'are', 'beamed', 'Enterprise.There', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'episode', 'first', 'amount', 'insubordination', 'towards', 'Spock', 'exhibited', 'remaining', 'members', 'crew', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'reasoning', 'even', 'way', 'Vulcans', 'act', 'Spock', 'commanding', 'officer', 'criticisms', 'are', 'unbecoming', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'personnel', 'only', 'times', 'series', 'when', 'crewmembers', 'question', 'commanding', 'officer', 'when', 'Spock', 'charge', 'McCoy', 'Kirk', 'never', 'questions', 'command', 'decisions', 'episode', 'Doomsday', 'Machine', 'when', 'obviously', 'disturbed', 'Commodore', 'Decker', 'command', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'orders', 'almost', 'ship.When', 'first', 'expendable', 'crewman', 'killed', 'others', 'start', 'criticizing', 'Spock', 'are', 'also', 'not', 'reacting', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'personnel', 'would', 'Part', 'training', 'would', 'be', 'soldiers', 'soldier', 'would', 'not', 'react', 'unexpected', 'death', 'comrade', 'criticizing', 'superior', 'officer.Finally', 'other', 'crewmembers', 'including', 'McCoy', 'are', 'favor', 'simply', 'killing', 'humanoid', 'fundamental', 'principle', 'non-interference', 'time', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'intelligent', 'creatures', 'are', 'such', 'situation', 'can', 'kill', 'only', 'when', 'lives', 'are', 'directly', 'risk', 'Therefore', 'Spock', 'statements', 'commands', 'are', 'more', 'line', 'Federation', 'law', 'urgings', 'shipmates', 'are', 'quite', 'barbaric', 'A', 'Private', 'Little', 'War', 'Spock', 'severely', 'shot', 'yet', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'phasers', 'defend', 'much', 'more', 'keeping', 'ethics', 'Federation', 'when', 'dealing', 'other', 'beings', 'world']",N/A
