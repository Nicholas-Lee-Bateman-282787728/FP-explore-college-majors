Then I saw a few moments of it on TV.... and was mesmerized. I rented it immediately and loved it.It is very very funny black humor, smart and well crafted, with lots of laugh-out-loud moments. And it's moving at times, too.I don't care anything about Gram Parson's hippie dippy cowboy music, it's just not my cup of tea. But this is not a bio pic or a music pic, it's black comedy fiction very loosely and I assume very inaccurately based on real events. So if you want to learn the truth about this incident, go read a book or an article, cause this movie just uses that tale as a jumping-off point. In other words, this ain't the history channel, it's the hysterical channel.Michael Shannon is just astonishing and hilarious as the stoned-beyond-stoned hippie Larry Oster-Berg. Shannon's performance reminds me of great screen weirdos like Crispin Glover and Steve Buscemi -- yeah, he is that good! Every moment Shannon is on the screen is wonderful, and he's in most of it.Oh, and there are some gorgeous backgrounds here!

845847,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0002V7SO8,Kevin Killian,"[4, 4]","I don't know about Robert Forster, but when he's on, he's on, and when he's overworked, he acts like he's been hit over the heat with an anvil.  That's the mode we find him in as he speaks his lines as Gram Parson's father, apparently stricken by grief when his son dies of an accidental overdose of drugs in Southern California in the 1970s.  When he arrives at the airport, he discovers that his son's corpse has been commandeered by road manager Phil Kaufman (Johnny Knoxville) in a psychedelic yellow hearse, and the chase begins.  Forster can barely even pretend to be interested in this strained road farce, but such is his gravitas that for awhile, we read his pained features as the earnest and moving performance of a man doubled over by the pain of surviving one's own child.  Since the real Parsons Senior died in the 1950s, he's playing a part that didn't really exist, and something of that unreality is perhaps affecting his weightlessness here.  Jack Lemmon did it all much better in Costa-Gavras' Missing, and I don't even like Jack Lemmon, but he was risking something emotionally, whereas for Forster, the draw seems to be the next paycheck over the horizon.Christina Applegate is playing someone fictional too, but at least she seems to have read even the other parts of the script.  But gee, Christina, all I can think of, get a new agent.  Even Marley Shelton is getting the better part in this movie, and who is Marley Shelton?  (Well, everyone knows her as the girl whose strange resemblance to Heather Graham made people think she was Heather Graham's stunt double.)  Here Shelton plays the girlfriend of Johnny Knoxville and winds up with a strange understanding of Christina Applegate's greedy gold-digger survivor.  The two women undergo a unique bonding while the grand chase is on.  And who gets to play the late Gram Parsons?  None other than Gabriel Macht--soon to leap across the world's multiplex screens as the embodiment of Will Eisner's pioneering comic super-hero The Spirit.  He's great here in a very tiny part and let's hope he does The Spirit with half of the spirit he brings to this very misbegotten, yet entertaining indie potboiler.",4,He's Not There,1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,2177,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'when', 'when', 'overworked', 'been', 'hit', 'heat', 'anvil', 'mode', 'find', 'lines', 'Gram', 'Parson', 'father', 'apparently', 'stricken', 'grief', 'when', 'son', 'dies', 'accidental', 'overdose', 'drugs', 'Southern', 'California', '1970s', 'When', 'airport', 'son', 'corpse', 'been', 'commandeered', 'road', 'manager', 'Phil', 'Kaufman', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'psychedelic', 'yellow', 'hearse', 'chase', 'Forster', 'can', 'barely', 'even', 'pretend', 'be', 'interested', 'strained', 'road', 'farce', 'such', 'gravitas', 'awhile', 'read', 'pained', 'features', 'earnest', 'moving', 'performance', 'man', 'doubled', 'pain', 'surviving', 'one', 'own', 'child', 'real', 'Parsons', 'Senior', 'died', '1950s', 'playing', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', 'something', 'unreality', 'perhaps', 'affecting', 'weightlessness', 'here', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'Costa-Gavras', 'Missing', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'like', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'was', 'risking', 'something', 'emotionally', 'whereas', 'Forster', 'draw', 'be', 'next', 'paycheck', 'horizon.Christina', 'Applegate', 'playing', 'someone', 'fictional', 'too', 'least', 'have', 'read', 'even', 'other', 'parts', 'script', 'gee', 'Christina', 'can', 'think', 'get', 'new', 'agent', 'Even', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'getting', 'better', 'part', 'movie', 'who', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'Well', 'everyone', 'girl', 'strange', 'resemblance', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'made', 'people', 'think', 'was', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'stunt', 'double', 'Here', 'Shelton', 'girlfriend', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'up', 'strange', 'understanding', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'greedy', 'gold-digger', 'survivor', 'two', 'women', 'undergo', 'unique', 'bonding', 'grand', 'chase', 'who', 'play', 'late', 'Gram', 'Parsons', 'None', 'other', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'soon', 'leap', 'world', 'multiplex', 'screens', 'embodiment', 'Will', 'Eisner', 'pioneering', 'comic', 'super-hero', 'Spirit', 'great', 'here', 'very', 'tiny', 'part', 'let', 'hope', 'Spirit', 'half', 'spirit', 'very', 'misbegotten', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'indie', 'potboiler']",Grand Theft Parsons
845848,A2HWGK45RBQX63,B0002V7SO8,"Mark ""a longtime record buyer""","[8, 15]","Well, here's the perspective of an old Byrds fan....  For what it's worth, I once had the good fortune to see the Parsons/ Hillman Burritos deliver a scorchingly hot unforgettable set at a private Hollywood party shortly after their first album.  And  have never forgotten Rolling Stone's extraordinary  investigative reporting piece, senselessly tragic and absurdly comic, relating the full story of Parsons' demise -- with details far more jaw dropping than anything here.  (And touching things, like the Byrds playing a series of gigs around the San Fernando valley to raise money for Kaufman's legal defense, each set including the ghoulish oldie ""Monster Mash"".)This is a truly bizarre chapter in the history of California folk and country rock, and I direct anyone interested to the Rolling Stone archives.  It is also the stuff of a great if  bizarre film -- which maybe someone will see in a hundred years or so.  But while certain people are still living, I would imagine just the legal clearances necessary for an honest telling are daunting.  What is also required is unflinchingly honest story telling courage -- which is here missing in spades.Basically I have to say the actors, director, writing, and striking desert photography in this film are pretty much up to snuff most of the time.  So They had the talent in place to deliver an honest picture...  Gram's music, though skimpy, is also good...  It's just that they skipped the real story and substituted a wholly imaginary and inoffensive formula yarn.This fictional concoction misfires from the start: news of Parsons' unexpected death has minimal impact on his longtime roadie Phil Kaufman.  The man scarcely misses a beat; it's pretty much, ""Oh man, we made that pact over beers, so I've gotta go get his body"" -- almost as casual as picking up someone's luggage at the airport.  This lack of emotional substance, whether humorous or sober, sets the tone for a film that feels increasingly shallow, forced, and insincere.And if my memory serves, after Kaufman and his hippie pal snatched Parson's body from LAX, the drive to Joshua Tree was pretty much without incident.Yet that trip is the focus of this film, filled with mostly bogus events in an imaginary story that slides from silly to goofy.  Parsons' girl friend chases them across the desert because she can't collect Gram's fortune until someone identifies the body for a death certificate (but San Bernadino County would not have shipped an unidentified corpse with no death certificate to New Orleans); somehow Kaufman's girl friend tags along with her to ""save"" Kaufman, though the girls dislike each other.  Meanwhile Gram's stepfather witnessed the body snatching from his airplane window seat on the runway, so without notifying police he grabs a car and also gives chase.  The California Highway Patrol somehow gets wind of this anyway and is thrown into the mix, on the lookout for the ""hippie hearse"".What follows is a watered down version of Burt Reynolds' old ""Cannonball Run"" movies.Simply put, I would hate to have this movie on my conscience.",2,NOTHING WAS DELIVERED,1114300800,"04 24, 2005",2005,3088,"['Well', 'here', 'perspective', 'old', 'Byrds', 'fan', 'what', 'worth', 'once', 'had', 'good', 'fortune', 'see', 'Parsons/', 'Hillman', 'Burritos', 'deliver', 'scorchingly', 'hot', 'unforgettable', 'set', 'private', 'Hollywood', 'party', 'shortly', 'first', 'album', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'extraordinary', 'investigative', 'reporting', 'piece', 'senselessly', 'tragic', 'absurdly', 'comic', 'relating', 'full', 'story', 'Parsons', 'demise', 'details', 'far', 'more', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'anything', 'here', 'touching', 'things', 'Byrds', 'playing', 'series', 'gigs', 'San', 'Fernando', 'valley', 'raise', 'money', 'Kaufman', 'legal', 'defense', 'set', 'including', 'ghoulish', 'oldie', 'Monster', 'Mash', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'chapter', 'history', 'California', 'folk', 'country', 'rock', 'direct', 'anyone', 'interested', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'also', 'stuff', 'great', 'bizarre', 'film', 'maybe', 'someone', 'will', 'see', 'hundred', 'years', 'so', 'certain', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'would', 'imagine', 'just', 'legal', 'clearances', 'necessary', 'honest', 'telling', 'are', 'daunting', 'What', 'also', 'required', 'unflinchingly', 'honest', 'story', 'telling', 'courage', 'here', 'missing', 'spades.Basically', 'have', 'say', 'actors', 'director', 'writing', 'striking', 'desert', 'photography', 'film', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'snuff', 'most', 'time', 'had', 'talent', 'place', 'deliver', 'honest', 'picture', 'Gram', 'music', 'skimpy', 'also', 'good', 'just', 'skipped', 'real', 'story', 'substituted', 'wholly', 'imaginary', 'inoffensive', 'formula', 'yarn.This', 'fictional', 'concoction', 'misfires', 'start', 'news', 'Parsons', 'unexpected', 'death', 'minimal', 'impact', 'longtime', 'roadie', 'Phil', 'Kaufman', 'man', 'scarcely', 'beat', 'pretty', 'much', 'Oh', 'man', 'made', 'pact', 'beers', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'go', 'get', 'body', 'almost', 'as', 'casual', 'picking', 'up', 'someone', 'luggage', 'airport', 'lack', 'emotional', 'substance', 'humorous', 'sober', 'tone', 'film', 'increasingly', 'shallow', 'forced', 'insincere.And', 'memory', 'serves', 'Kaufman', 'hippie', 'pal', 'snatched', 'Parson', 'body', 'LAX', 'drive', 'Joshua', 'Tree', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'incident.Yet', 'trip', 'focus', 'film', 'filled', 'mostly', 'bogus', 'events', 'imaginary', 'story', 'silly', 'goofy', 'Parsons', 'girl', 'friend', 'desert', 'ca', ""n't"", 'collect', 'Gram', 'fortune', 'someone', 'body', 'death', 'certificate', 'San', 'Bernadino', 'County', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'shipped', 'unidentified', 'corpse', 'death', 'certificate', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Kaufman', 'girl', 'friend', 'save', 'Kaufman', 'girls', 'dislike', 'other', 'Meanwhile', 'Gram', 'stepfather', 'witnessed', 'body', 'snatching', 'airplane', 'window', 'seat', 'runway', 'so', 'notifying', 'police', 'car', 'also', 'chase', 'California', 'Highway', 'Patrol', 'somehow', 'wind', 'anyway', 'thrown', 'mix', 'lookout', 'hippie', 'hearse', 'watered', 'down', 'version', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'old', 'Cannonball', 'Run', 'movies.Simply', 'put', 'would', 'hate', 'have', 'movie', 'conscience']",Grand Theft Parsons

While it succeeds in being subtly humorous, the main plot of a corpse being transported by stolen hearse from LA to Joshua Tree, CA is perhaps too morbid to begin with, especially since it's based on the actual death of the `70's `Alternate Country Western' singer Gram Parsons, September 1973.  But overall, I believe these offbeat, low-budget, independent film-makers often present interesting stories, otherwise not available.  Unfortunately, without the budget for studio voice-overs, the audio fades in some crucial dialog points.  However, this film includes actor summaries and is well acted by the primary 3 players, Johnny Knoxville (Phil Kaufman), Christina Applegate (Barbara) and Marley Shelton (Susie).

If you're a Gram Parsons fan, particularly in the elderly set, this movie is likely to give you the deep blues. I was really excited to see that someone attempted to tell this weird tale of comradeship, love, and stupidity, and I hope that Phil Kaufmann earned a few bucks from it. Sadly, the movie just doesn't make it, whether as a buddy movie, as a comedy-drama, or as a tale of weirdness. The actors seem to be giving it an earnest effort, but the script is just so stiff (no pun intended) that no one could have carried it off effectively. The movie fails to shed much light on Gram Parsons, who, contrary to the film's depiction, was largely unknown to the masses at the time of his death (the Byrds' Sweetheart album was a commercial disappointment; the Burrito albums were commercial disasters; Gram's own first album was already in the cut-out bins when I bought it for $2 in early summer 1973. His death created some anticipation for his second solo album, but essentially no one bought it at the time. If you don't believe me, look at the Billboard charts, where it hardly measured in the top 200 LPs! Gram's legend would come later, thanks to large measure to Emmy Lou Harris' devotion). The film is success, however, in revealing that Parsons commanded an immense amount of respect from his friends and colleagues. One hopes that someone else tries to tackle this compelling story sometime in the future, hopefully with a better script and a stronger vision.",2,"Not too grand, not really a theft, and not a lot of parsons",1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,1581,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'then', 'wild', 'horses', 'could', ""n't"", 'drag', 'away', 'movie', ""'re"", 'Gram', 'Parsons', 'fan', 'particularly', 'elderly', 'set', 'movie', 'likely', 'give', 'deep', 'blues', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'see', 'someone', 'attempted', 'tell', 'weird', 'tale', 'comradeship', 'love', 'stupidity', 'hope', 'Phil', 'Kaufmann', 'earned', 'few', 'bucks', 'Sadly', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'buddy', 'movie', 'comedy-drama', 'tale', 'weirdness', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'giving', 'earnest', 'effort', 'script', 'just', 'so', 'stiff', 'pun', 'intended', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'carried', 'off', 'effectively', 'movie', 'shed', 'much', 'light', 'Gram', 'Parsons', 'who', 'contrary', 'film', 'depiction', 'was', 'largely', 'unknown', 'masses', 'time', 'death', 'Byrds', 'Sweetheart', 'album', 'was', 'commercial', 'disappointment', 'Burrito', 'albums', 'were', 'commercial', 'disasters', 'Gram', 'own', 'first', 'album', 'was', 'already', 'cut-out', 'when', 'bought', '2', 'early', 'summer', '1973', 'death', 'created', 'anticipation', 'second', 'solo', 'album', 'essentially', 'one', 'bought', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'look', 'Billboard', 'charts', 'where', 'hardly', 'measured', 'top', '200', 'LPs', 'Gram', 'legend', 'would', 'come', 'later', 'thanks', 'large', 'measure', 'Emmy', 'Lou', 'Harris', 'devotion', 'film', 'success', 'however', 'revealing', 'Parsons', 'commanded', 'immense', 'amount', 'respect', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'One', 'someone', 'else', 'tackle', 'compelling', 'story', 'sometime', 'future', 'hopefully', 'better', 'script', 'stronger', 'vision']",Grand Theft Parsons

At the very least, it has a couple of pretty funny parts, but that's it.",2,not a comedy,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,543,"['saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'looked', 'very', 'funny', 'Let', 'be', 'clear', 'movie', 'not', 'comedy', 'funny', 'parts', 'were', 'trailer', 'actors', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'very', 'interesting', 'story', 'production', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'also', 'However', 'being', 'went', 'expecting', 'be', 'comedy', 'very', 'least', 'humorous', 'was', 'completely', 'disapointed', 'movie', 'NOT', 'A', 'COMEDY', 'even', 'most', 'time', 'very', 'least', 'couple', 'pretty', 'funny', 'parts']",Grand Theft Parsons

That shouldn't matter since this movie made me aware of him, but the movie and acting was great.  I loved the hippie, gonna have to go back and watch some movies with Michael Shannon in it.  And, you shouldn't judge Johnny Knoxville because of what he has done in the past, he was cast great in this movie. The only problem I had with it was Christina Applegate, but thats cause I don't really care for her since Married with Children, she will always be known as Kelly Bundy to me.  Marley Shelton was also great in this movie, she needs to be more known than her teeny bopper type roles they cast her in.  Overall, this was a great movie to watch, whether you knew who Gram Parsons was.",5,Better than I thought it would be,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,782,"['watched', 'movie', 'cause', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'Gram', 'Parsons', 'should', ""n't"", 'matter', 'movie', 'made', 'aware', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'loved', 'hippie', 'gon', 'na', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'movies', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'should', ""n't"", 'judge', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'what', 'done', 'past', 'was', 'cast', 'great', 'movie', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'thats', 'cause', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Married', 'Children', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'known', 'Kelly', 'Bundy', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'movie', 'be', 'more', 'known', 'teeny', 'bopper', 'type', 'cast', 'Overall', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'knew', 'who', 'Gram', 'Parsons', 'was']",Grand Theft Parsons
