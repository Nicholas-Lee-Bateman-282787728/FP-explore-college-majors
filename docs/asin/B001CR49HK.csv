A couple are on the upbeat side, but the overall tone is downbeat.  I'm sure the realism is dear to some who will insist life often takes the downturns these exhibit. But who wants to pay to see that?  I did enjoy seeing many actors in younger days, the costumes and overall quality of the production.  But can't see doing a re-visit on any of them.  Would definitely recommend not viewing two or three in a row as the cumulative effect can be rather depressing.  The two with the artist are the best, which end the series on a good note if you watch them in order.

1177439,A34U9IN59BEZLM,B001CR49HK,Frances Di Pasqua,"[3, 3]","Like most British literary series of the 70's, these stagings are short on dazzling set design & cinematography, but are very well-costumed and have plenty of period costume eye-candy.The scripts are tight and, judging from what I remember about the original James books, faithful to the stories' basic themes. When you condense a novel down to a 50-minute play, as they do here with ""The Wings of the Dove"", some finer points will get lost but the gist of the story is expressed well.A great part of the satisfaction of a series like this is to see actors as they were back in the day. Diana Rigg, Jeremy Brett, Patricia Routledge, Margaret Tyzack and Anton Rodgers are a few of the actors who are better known for other work. If you know Routledge only from her work on ""Keeping Up Appearances"", her younger self here will be a nice surprise.For some people, the pace of these episodes may feel slow (I felt that as well) but I would say that you should just accept that and relax into the different pace of story-telling.

Stories are primarily Victorian era, as Henry James himself died in 1916.  He left behind many very interesting stories and in this DVD set, seven of them have been brought to life in a fun way.Each of the episodes is based on a separate book.  Author James has a way of leaving the ending a surprise. Not always does boy get girl, or girl get boy, or all's-well-that-ends-well. You CAN expect the unexpected. That is the delight of this set.  Some are romantic tragedy, some comedy, some suspense, a full smorgasbord of high living played out with a wide range of accomplished British actors and actresses.Episode 1: ""Catherine"" based on ""Washington Square""Episode 2: ""Adela"" based on ""The Marriages""Episode 3: ""Miss Tita"" based on ""The Aspern Papers""Episode 4: ""Grace"" based on ""Covering End""Episode 5: ""Milly"" based on The Wings of the Dove""Episode 6: ""Flora"" based on ""Glasses""Episode 7: ""Mary and Louisa"" based on ""The Tone of Time"" and ""The Real Thing""If you don't know of Henry James and his writing, the included biography on the DVD set will help.

1177441,AXUDXQFT83YO9,B001CR49HK,"John Gough ""John Gough - Deakin University""","[1, 1]","Henry James brought to life by ITVI am staggered that this (and the second series) is a Region 1 USA import, but I can only guess that Americans count Henry James as an AMERICAN writer, despite the fact that his literary career was almost exclusively based in London and Europe.This series was devised by Terence Feely, and produced by ITV in 1974.Other (Amazon USA) reviews list the sources of each of the seven story, by Henry James, concealed behind the episode-titles of women's names: e.g. ""Miss Tita"" for Episode 3 based on ""The Aspern Papers"", or ""Catherine"" for Episode 1, based on ""Washington Square"" (also filmed as ""The Heiress""), or ""Milly"" for Episode 5 based on ""The Wings of a Dove"", itself based on the life and tubercular death of Henry James' neice.The production values are TV-only, not ""film"", being pre-""Brideshead"" or ""Jewel in the Crown"", or Jeremy Brett's incomparable ""Sherlock Holmes"". (Brett has a leading role in one of the stories!)But as the chosen stories are mainly ""chamber music"", played indoors, the theatre-like sets are not a serious issue.The costumes are fine.The script is eloquent.The casting is generally excellent, although when Gayle Hunnicut's beautiful face says she has ""excellent teeth"" (as part of the vain charms of the impoverished and tragically blighted beauty in Episode 6, ""Flora"", based on James' story ""Glasses"") this is unfortunate, as Hunnicutt has strikingly unusual dentures.Her face, however, is ravishing, of course.As a whole, the seven stories range across subtle drama, tragedy, light comedy, and even a light-handed farce, in the final story of two women who had each loved, and been jilted by, a roguish Italian musician.The dialogue occasionally sounds like Jane Austen's writing: very, very proper, and refined, and alusive.At other times (as in ""Milly"") it has the coyness of E.M. Forster. Is the secretly engaged but impoverished bachelor really meant to marry, or just to physically satisfy, the wealthy young orphaned girl who is dying? The negotiations over this are subtle and at times quite suggestive, especially as the man's price for agreeing to woo the girl is that his fiancee should first submit to him, physically (undressed bodies seen for about a second!).Overall, this is an excellent way to enjoy Henry James, in a wide range of moods, and also enjoy a fine collection of actors, including Diana Rigg as a highly amusing American adventuress manipulating relationships and real estate. (George Cole is the unscrupulous pater and real estate scoundrel -- eerily anticipating his role in ""The Minder"").Patricia Routledge (best known for her role as Hyacinth Bucket -- ""boo-quay"" -- in ""Keeping Up Appearances"") is seen as a younger and pretty old-maiden aunt in the otherwise tragic version of ""Glasses"".Highly recommended!John Gough - Melbourne, Australia - jagough49@gmail.com",5,Henry James brought to life by ITV,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,2864,"['Henry', 'James', 'brought', 'life', 'ITVI', 'am', 'staggered', 'second', 'series', 'Region', '1', 'USA', 'import', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'Americans', 'count', 'Henry', 'James', 'AMERICAN', 'writer', 'fact', 'literary', 'career', 'was', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'based', 'London', 'Europe.This', 'series', 'was', 'devised', 'Terence', 'Feely', 'produced', 'ITV', '1974.Other', 'Amazon', 'USA', 'list', 'sources', 'seven', 'story', 'Henry', 'James', 'concealed', 'episode-titles', 'women', 'names', 'e.g', 'Miss', 'Tita', 'Episode', '3', 'based', 'Aspern', 'Papers', 'Catherine', 'Episode', '1', 'based', 'Washington', 'Square', 'also', 'filmed', 'Heiress', 'Milly', 'Episode', '5', 'based', 'Wings', 'Dove', 'based', 'life', 'tubercular', 'death', 'Henry', 'James', 'neice.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'TV-only', 'not', 'film', 'being', 'pre-', 'Brideshead', 'Jewel', 'Crown', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'incomparable', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Brett', 'leading', 'role', 'one', 'stories', 'chosen', 'stories', 'are', 'mainly', 'chamber', 'music', 'played', 'indoors', 'theatre-like', 'sets', 'are', 'not', 'serious', 'issue.The', 'costumes', 'are', 'fine.The', 'script', 'eloquent.The', 'casting', 'generally', 'excellent', 'when', 'Gayle', 'Hunnicut', 'beautiful', 'face', 'excellent', 'teeth', 'part', 'vain', 'charms', 'impoverished', 'tragically', 'blighted', 'beauty', 'Episode', '6', 'Flora', 'based', 'James', 'story', 'Glasses', 'unfortunate', 'Hunnicutt', 'strikingly', 'unusual', 'dentures.Her', 'face', 'however', 'ravishing', 'course.As', 'whole', 'seven', 'stories', 'range', 'subtle', 'drama', 'tragedy', 'light', 'comedy', 'even', 'light-handed', 'farce', 'final', 'story', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'had', 'loved', 'been', 'jilted', 'roguish', 'Italian', 'musician.The', 'dialogue', 'occasionally', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'writing', 'very', 'very', 'proper', 'refined', 'alusive.At', 'other', 'times', 'Milly', 'coyness', 'E.M.', 'Forster', 'secretly', 'engaged', 'impoverished', 'bachelor', 'really', 'meant', 'marry', 'just', 'physically', 'satisfy', 'wealthy', 'young', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'who', 'dying', 'negotiations', 'are', 'subtle', 'times', 'quite', 'suggestive', 'especially', 'man', 'price', 'agreeing', 'woo', 'girl', 'fiancee', 'should', 'first', 'submit', 'physically', 'undressed', 'bodies', 'seen', 'second', '.Overall', 'excellent', 'way', 'enjoy', 'Henry', 'James', 'wide', 'range', 'moods', 'also', 'enjoy', 'fine', 'collection', 'actors', 'including', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'highly', 'amusing', 'American', 'adventuress', 'manipulating', 'relationships', 'real', 'estate', 'George', 'Cole', 'unscrupulous', 'pater', 'real', 'estate', 'scoundrel', 'eerily', 'anticipating', 'role', 'Minder', '.Patricia', 'Routledge', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'Hyacinth', 'Bucket', 'boo-quay', 'Keeping', 'Up', 'Appearances', 'seen', 'younger', 'pretty', 'old-maiden', 'aunt', 'otherwise', 'tragic', 'version', 'Glasses', '.Highly', 'recommended', 'John', 'Gough', 'Melbourne', 'Australia', 'jagough49', '@', 'gmail.com']","Affairs of the Heart, Series 1"
