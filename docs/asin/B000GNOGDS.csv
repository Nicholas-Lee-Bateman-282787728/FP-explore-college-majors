She plays a sweet little character, no it's not a serious movie but it's a light sweet hearted comedy. I feel so sorry for Paris when it says in the magazines that Paris's new movie was a flop. It's really good. Just because she's an heiress doesn't mean she has no talent. She plays a light-minded sweetheart in an attempt to become famous and ends up dating this famous cute guy and they use it to publicise themselves, however the scheming Lisa Mancini has a plot to get all of her ""boyfriend""'s money.Negative points: It kind of waffles on about the whole story and it could have been an excellent cinema movie if they had a higher budget.Plus Paris's new film ""Pledge This!"" is set to hit big in the cinemas as it sold out in the box office pre-booked hits.This film is touching, sweet, Californian and...Paris!",5,Paris Hilton.,1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,957,"['Why', 'do', 'always', 'pick', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Yes', 'know', 'was', 'bad', 'Hillz', 'L.A', 'Knights', 'really', 'did', 'great', 'movie', 'sweet', 'little', 'character', 'not', 'serious', 'movie', 'light', 'sweet', 'hearted', 'comedy', 'feel', 'so', 'sorry', 'Paris', 'when', 'magazines', 'Paris', 'new', 'movie', 'was', 'flop', 'really', 'good', 'Just', 'heiress', ""n't"", 'mean', 'talent', 'light-minded', 'sweetheart', 'attempt', 'become', 'famous', 'up', 'dating', 'famous', 'cute', 'guy', 'use', 'publicise', 'however', 'scheming', 'Lisa', 'Mancini', 'plot', 'get', 'boyfriend', 'money.Negative', 'points', 'kind', 'waffles', 'whole', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'cinema', 'movie', 'had', 'higher', 'budget.Plus', 'Paris', 'new', 'film', 'Pledge', 'set', 'hit', 'big', 'cinemas', 'sold', 'out', 'box', 'office', 'pre-booked', 'hits.This', 'film', 'touching', 'sweet', 'Californian', 'Paris']",N/A

This is the only character in the movie worth watching as he is hilarious pretending to be straight when he is the very definition of flaming queen.Goober wants to be cool, so he wrangles his way into Lisa Mancini's (Paris Hilton) current boyfriend's (Brian Hallisay) entourage.

While in Hollywood he is forced to stay at the home of hos blatently [...] Uncle Earl (David Keith).Owen meets and falls in love with the daughter of studio executive A.J.

1005465,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000GNOGDS,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 2]","Bottoms Up was released straight to DVD and the reviews are bad, bad, bad, but I enjoyed the movie and it made me think. First, I admit that the story is not very plausible and neither Mewes nor Paris are the greatest actors, but they were more than adequate for this light hearted story about a Midwestern bartender who goes to Hollywood to try and win a bartending contest and save his father's bar from foreclosure. If you were expecting to see any bottle juggling pyrotechnic bartender high jinks, a la Coyote Ugly or Tom Cruise in Cocktail you'll be disappointed, although there are a few scenes of that. Basically, Owen Peadman's (Jason Mewes') plan changes once he gets there and starts working for his Uncle Earl (David Keith), a free lance tabloid reporter. While working on a story on the studio lot Lisa Mancini (Paris Hilton), the daughter of the studio boss, gets into an accident and blames Owen, getting him and his uncle fired. They vow revenge and hatch a plot to ingratiate Owen into the inner circle so he can dig up some dirt on them, sell the story to the tabloids, and ruin their lives and get the money to save his dad's bar back home.What made this tawdry tale interesting to me was how it revealed Paris Hilton's method of operation and her ambitions. ""I don't want to be known as the grand-daughter of the Hiltons. I want to be known as Paris,"" said Paris. Though she is viewed as a lazy socialite, and widely scorned for her perceived narcissism, her shallow intellect, and her crass materialism, she is actually creating a Brand, ""Paris Hilton,"" and she uses the tabloids as much as they use her, to keep herself in the public eye and get publicity for her perfume, clothing line, night clubs, and film and recording projects. Perhaps there is no such thing as bad publicity, the way Paris sees the world. She first gained notoriety when the explicit private video 1 Night in Paris was accidentally released--or was it an accident? Her well publicized feuds with her various party girl playmates also stoked the flames of her notoriety. Even a DUI was turned to her advantage, though when she was released early, there was a big hue and cry, and a backlash against her, and she did serve some time, and made a mea culpa tour where she displayed the proper amount of contriteness. ""I think the biggest misconception about me is that I'm this spoiled brat. But I'm not. I'm the total opposite,"" said Paris.Though she was a laughingstock, she can get booked on Letterman, and all she has to do is keep her chin up, flirt with him a little bit, and he is putty in her hands. ""I talk in that baby talk voice when I'm on TV, it's a put on,"" says Paris. I haven't even mentioned how they tried to use her in the McCain campaign, and you saw how that worked out for them.She is playing the dumb blonde to the hilt, like Jessica Simpson, seen on reality TV wondering whether Chicken of the Sea Tuna is Chicken. She later made a commercial where she wondered if Buffalo Wings came from flying buffalos. What can you make of statements from Paris Hilton like: ""I went to Wal-Mart for the first time. I always thought they sold wallpaper. I didn't realize it has everything. You can get anything you want there for really, really cheap."" It makes her sound sheltered but not a snob, no she is down for buying stuff really cheap. ""I take my dog Tinkerbelle seriously. I take my job seriously. But I don't take myself all that seriously,"" says Paris.That is a good strategy when you are in the public eye and a target for cheap jokes and paparazzi attacks. What does Paris think is her biggest flaw? ""I desperately hate one thing about my body. I have size 11 feet. Yeah, it sucks, because I see all these super cute shoes in the stores: Guccis, YSLs, Manolos. And when they bring them out in my size, they look like clown shoes,"" says Paris. Poor Paris. See, it's working. I am starting to feel sympathy for her.Jason Mewes is on a slightly different career trajectory, but it isn't really as different as it seems. His friend, Kevin Smith, realized that the only way he was ever going to get any McLovin' was for him to become a film director, and Mewes rode that gravy train through a whole series of films, establishing himself and Smith as the iconic figures, Jay and Silent Bob. In Bottoms Up, Jason starts to move out of Smith's humongous shadow, but there is still a cameo appearance. The Owen Peadman character is a little more subdued then motor mouth Jay. His secret in becoming a part of a celebrity entourage is to not fawn over the famous, be a little sassy, like you couldn't care less. A little extortion, just to get your foot in the door, doesn't hurt, either.Hottie & the Nottie(2008) .... Paris Hilton was Cristabel AbbottHouse of Wax (Widescreen Edition)(2005) ....

1005466,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000GNOGDS,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 7]","I can hardly believe it myself, but I've now seen three - three! - Paris Hilton movies.  I fear I'm actually beginning to find her attractive, which is a pretty frightening thought.  The woman can't act a lick, though.  I didn't think she was all that bad in House of Wax, but Bottoms Up might as well have been titled Thumbs Down.  As far as I can tell, both Paris and Jason Mewes are distinguished graduates of the Hayden Christensen School of Acting, and they decided to have a full-fledged act-off to prove, once and for all, which of them is the least talented actor/actress in the universe.  Unfortunately, it's impossible to determine a winner because they're equally bad.  Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith may be pretty entertaining when they're together, but Mewes is just helpless when he's on his own (Kevin Smith is in this movie, but it's only a small role, and he and Mewes are only together for a minute or two).Mewes plays Owen, a Minnesota boy who goes to Hollywood to compete in a big bartender's contest, hoping to use the prize money to save his dad's steakhouse.  Since he's basically broke, he stays with his outrageously-gay-but-pretending-to-be-straight uncle Earl (David Keith, the only cast member who put any effort at all into his role).  Earl works for a tabloid news show - until, that is, the uber-famous Lisa Mancini (Paris Hilton) gets him fired.  That's when Earl and Owen vow revenge on Lisa, her hunk-of-the-month boyfriend Hayden Field (Brian Hallisey), and their whole hoity-toity crowd.  A little dishonesty goes a long way, gaining Owen access to Hollywood's in crowd.  As he gets to know them, however, he begins to see that their images don't necessarily reflect their true selves.  Could it be that the fantabulous Lisa Mancini isn't truly a party girl, and that there's actually a human being in there somewhere?  Who knows?  Who cares?  With its terribly weak script and consistently bad acting, any point this movie even tries to make is moot at best.I'm giving the film two stars because I did enjoy seeing a couple of annoying characters get what they deserve in the end, and David Keith's way-over-the-top performance can be pretty entertaining.  There's Keith going all out for his role, while everyone else just sleepwalks through the entire movie.

It is a nice fun movie that simply shows some of the old school talents from clerks and Paris acting which is slowly improving. Paris actually shows a little charm in this movie and becomes a likable. The image of Paris on the cover and title page is the worst picture I have ever seen of her. Since she is so concerned with her image, I am surprised that she allowed it. It would have been nice to have some more cameo's in the movie.

Might want to see this movie because there's a few parts in the film you'll keep thinking about throughout your day because its so funny. If you notice in the film there is a shot of a million dollar Ferrari which is pretty nuts. Film was shot in a few clubs that I've been to so that was also pretty cool. So ya overall I liked it and don't understand why people are not going to getting this DVD. I'm surprised this film didn't go to theaters because its better then half the movies that are there now.
