884941,A235NA61RC6YC1,B0007OIDBW,George Dionne,"[3, 5]","The GoodThere's no denying that The Great Kat is one of the fastest guitar shredders currently on the scene. She flies through run after run with such precision and accuracy. Not only is she a master of the six-string, but she's equally as nimble on the violin. She's also quite hot, in a sadomasochistic sort-of way and loves her country. But...The BadShe's too fast to string those runs into enjoyable songs. Granted most shredding is done at the high end of the scale, but pair that up with equally as fast violin, you've got a high pitched earache. It's also tough to determine what is guitar and what is violin on some songs.Let's start with the DVD. You do get six videos of The Great Kat doing what she does best, but the storylines are a bit disturbing. If you're into torture, castration, sex slavery, and pain, you'll have no problems with her. Though, I have to wonder why the castration had to be censored, as this is an unrated DVD. The bonus features are a little on the paltry side. You get a photo montage of The Great Kat in all her glory plus a screen of DVD credits. Includes with the features is a ""Shred FAQ,"" where you can lean what her videos and music is all about. I think a lesson would have been coolThe CD, Wagner's War, is a collection of 7 classical pieces interpreted by The Great Kat. It's quite impressive that she plays the majority of classical instruments as well, but the execution of that many instruments becomes cluttered. The Great Kat reworks pieces by Wagner, List and Sarasate. For those of you that aren't really into the classics, you'll recognize them from the Bugs Bunny cartoons. Added to these songs are lyrics penned by The Great Kat that are either growling battle cries, or screams of dominance. The biggest problem I have with this CD is that she plays the songs so fast, they become only a minute or two long. Now, she only charges $7.00 for 7 songs, but the whole disc runs 11 minutes.The VerdictBy far, The Great Kat is the fastest female shredder I've ever heard, and quite possibly one of the fastest of today. Her idea to rework classical music into something exciting and full of guitar mastery is a good one, but the final outcome is a little hard to swallow. There's just too much going on at the same time, her rapid-fire guitar runs clash too much with her equally as fast violin work, her vocals will scare the piss out of you, and the songs are too short. Although I bet she's a blast at parties.",2,There's no denying that The Great Kat is one of the fastest guitar shredders,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,2463,"['GoodThere', 'denying', 'Great', 'Kat', 'one', 'fastest', 'guitar', 'shredders', 'currently', 'scene', 'run', 'run', 'such', 'precision', 'accuracy', 'Not', 'only', 'master', 'six-string', 'equally', 'as', 'nimble', 'violin', 'also', 'quite', 'hot', 'sadomasochistic', 'sort-of', 'way', 'country', 'BadShe', 'too', 'fast', 'string', 'runs', 'enjoyable', 'songs', 'Granted', 'most', 'shredding', 'done', 'high', 'end', 'scale', 'pair', 'equally', 'fast', 'violin', ""'ve"", 'got', 'high', 'pitched', 'earache', 'also', 'tough', 'determine', 'what', 'guitar', 'what', 'violin', 'songs.Let', 'start', 'DVD', 'do', 'get', 'six', 'videos', 'Great', 'Kat', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'storylines', 'are', 'bit', 'disturbing', ""'re"", 'torture', 'castration', 'sex', 'slavery', 'pain', ""'ll"", 'have', 'problems', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'castration', 'had', 'be', 'censored', 'unrated', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'little', 'paltry', 'side', 'get', 'photo', 'montage', 'Great', 'Kat', 'glory', 'screen', 'DVD', 'credits', 'Includes', 'features', 'Shred', 'FAQ', 'where', 'can', 'lean', 'what', 'videos', 'music', 'think', 'lesson', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'coolThe', 'CD', 'Wagner', 'War', 'collection', '7', 'classical', 'pieces', 'interpreted', 'Great', 'Kat', 'quite', 'impressive', 'majority', 'classical', 'instruments', 'well', 'execution', 'many', 'instruments', 'becomes', 'cluttered', 'Great', 'Kat', 'reworks', 'pieces', 'Wagner', 'List', 'Sarasate', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'classics', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'cartoons', 'Added', 'songs', 'are', 'lyrics', 'penned', 'Great', 'Kat', 'are', 'growling', 'battle', 'cries', 'screams', 'dominance', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'CD', 'songs', 'fast', 'become', 'only', 'minute', 'two', 'long', 'Now', 'only', '7.00', '7', 'songs', 'whole', 'disc', '11', 'minutes.The', 'VerdictBy', 'far', 'Great', 'Kat', 'fastest', 'female', 'shredder', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'quite', 'possibly', 'one', 'fastest', 'today', 'idea', 'rework', 'classical', 'music', 'something', 'exciting', 'full', 'guitar', 'mastery', 'good', 'one', 'final', 'outcome', 'little', 'hard', 'swallow', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'rapid-fire', 'guitar', 'clash', 'too', 'much', 'equally', 'fast', 'violin', 'work', 'vocals', 'will', 'scare', 'piss', 'songs', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'bet', 'blast', 'parties']",N/A
884942,A11XKY4EIU2KNR,B0007OIDBW,"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist""","[7, 11]","OK, granted The Great Kat isn't for everybody, nor does she want to be. That's one of the many reasons I like her. I love her image, her playing, her attitude, and her sexuality. She can play, there is no denying that. But you really can't tell how great she is from this video alone.I play guitar myself, and yes the Kat could blow me away with her musical knowledge, but...... would it kill her to play a simple riff? I mean a guitar player has to have some meat and potatoes to go along with 1000 note a minute solos. A good heavy, crunchy, three chord riff is just as important. But I guess that's not really The Kat's style. Thankfully she is carryig the torch in an age where guitar solos are all but dead. This video is nothing short of frenzied soloing. I wonder if she even touches the low E or A strings on these songs. Her version of Beethoven's Fifth is awesome, she should have included that on here. It was brutal, and proves she can play power chords.I was disappointed with her 'live' footage. I thought it would be a live performance of a song. Instead it's footage pieced together from one concert. So it's actually her playing live on stage as you listen to a studio song. I wanted some raw Kat, but it's more of a 'highlights' real from her Chicago show.The WAR video is interesting with her all in camoflauge, and I like her American Tribute video, she's really hot in that American flag bikini. Castration is cool too because she dresses up as a belly dancer and a geisha.For those not sure if they are interested in Kat, they may want to check this out. This DVD is really nothing more than a 15 minute sampling of what the Kat is all about, if you like it, great, look deeper and get some CDs. If you decide you don't like her, well you didn't even spend 10 bucks to find out.My real question though is this, does The Great Kat have lockjaw? I mean you never see her with her mouth cloesd, her chin is always down to her chest. She keeps her mouth as wide open as possible at all times. I challange anyone to find a picture of her with her mouth closed.Well rock on folks, I support The Great Kat, hope to catch her live someday.",4,An honest review by a fan of The Great Kat,1122595200,"07 29, 2005",2005,2153,"['OK', 'granted', 'Great', 'Kat', ""n't"", 'everybody', 'want', 'be', 'one', 'many', 'reasons', 'love', 'image', 'playing', 'attitude', 'sexuality', 'can', 'play', 'denying', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'great', 'video', 'play', 'guitar', 'yes', 'Kat', 'could', 'blow', 'away', 'musical', 'knowledge', 'would', 'kill', 'play', 'simple', 'riff', 'mean', 'guitar', 'player', 'have', 'meat', 'potatoes', 'go', 'along', '1000', 'note', 'minute', 'solos', 'good', 'heavy', 'crunchy', 'three', 'chord', 'riff', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'guess', 'not', 'really', 'Kat', 'style', 'Thankfully', 'carryig', 'torch', 'age', 'where', 'guitar', 'solos', 'are', 'dead', 'video', 'nothing', 'short', 'frenzied', 'soloing', 'wonder', 'even', 'low', 'E', 'A', 'strings', 'songs', 'version', 'Beethoven', 'Fifth', 'awesome', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'here', 'was', 'brutal', 'can', 'play', 'power', 'chords.I', 'was', 'disappointed', ""'live"", 'footage', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'live', 'performance', 'song', 'Instead', 'footage', 'pieced', 'together', 'one', 'concert', 'actually', 'playing', 'live', 'stage', 'listen', 'studio', 'song', 'wanted', 'raw', 'Kat', 'more', ""'highlights"", 'real', 'Chicago', 'show.The', 'WAR', 'video', 'interesting', 'camoflauge', 'like', 'American', 'Tribute', 'video', 'really', 'hot', 'American', 'flag', 'bikini', 'Castration', 'cool', 'too', 'up', 'belly', 'dancer', 'geisha.For', 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'interested', 'Kat', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', '15', 'minute', 'sampling', 'what', 'Kat', 'like', 'great', 'look', 'deeper', 'get', 'CDs', 'decide', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'spend', '10', 'bucks', 'find', 'out.My', 'real', 'question', 'though', 'Great', 'Kat', 'have', 'lockjaw', 'mean', 'never', 'see', 'mouth', 'cloesd', 'chin', 'always', 'down', 'chest', 'mouth', 'wide', 'open', 'possible', 'times', 'challange', 'anyone', 'find', 'picture', 'mouth', 'closed.Well', 'rock', 'folks', 'support', 'Great', 'Kat', 'hope', 'catch', 'live', 'someday']",N/A
884943,ABCPSSKGKS3EI,B0007OIDBW,MARTY E. MCINTOSH,"[3, 6]","I have to say in all honesty that this whole DVD and the great kat is a joke. sure, there are female speed-metal guitar shredders now, and this one is simply a joke. however, there is a male speed-metal guitar player. Vinnie Vincent. the king-best of all guitar shredders. Vinnie Vincent, formally from the glam-band KISS, still remains one of the hot-guitar shredders of the 80's, 90's and beyond. Vinnie was well known of this type of guitar playing long before the great kat coughed up her first album. Vinnie Vincent rules. this dumb great kat sucks. she is a joke on and off stage. she sets the standard for the many stupid guitar players out there. one reviewer stated on here. that you can't tell which parts are from playing guitar or which parts are the violin. that takes the cake, whoever heard of a heavy metal violinist. and although I do like heavy metal music, this DVD remains the worst music I have ever heard. oh, and by the way,the music she is playing, anyone can play this kind of music. she is very much duplicating what ever speed-metal band has all ready done basically, I have heard this kind of music before, and I have alot of experiance at it. now, as far as the her bleeding from her fingers on stage, if this is real blood, she needs to seek very serious medical attention. if it's not real blood, then that part of it is fine.

It is simply a collection of 6 videos that last only 2 minutes each.The ENTIRE disc runs no more than 15 minutes, which is a total rip-off.Kat looks like quite an able guitar player but it is really hard to judge from this DVD.The short videos are extremely fast, with a wall of sound cacophony of noise and grunting animal sound vocals which is nothing less than annoying.The visual images are disturbing and this is a real schlock piece made to cash in on the Vampire/Speed Metal genre. This is gimmick music if this can even be called music. I'm no prude, I love Sacred Reich, Pantera & all sorts of speed metal. But this disc is simply garbage.Kat looks like she might have some talent because she can play really fast. But then again I can also play guitar really fast and with a wall of sound band noise behind me you couldn't tell if I was missing notes or what. All her speed is pointless and wasted on this garbage.  A whole lot less speed and a good deal more passion might help her playing.She should join a decent band and actually play songs and guitar solos instead of this noise.
