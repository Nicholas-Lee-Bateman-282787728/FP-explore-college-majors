1592,A3MWP39R0W9TQX,0510539610,"Heather W. ""heartful_home""","[95, 115]","Struggling with incontinence for years, and having tried Kegels, I have considered getting surgery several times. But once I started these exercises, it was so much better. I didn't do them too long before life took over, and slowly the incontinence returned. I couldn't find the disk to start over, but I just did again. SO GLAD.There are 3 sections.Educational (you only need to watch it once--good information)Regular exercises (4 different 'workouts' ranging from 10-23 minutes. Expect to spend 20 minutes most days.Time sensitive exercises (where they have slightly shorter versions of the exercises.I am so impressed with all the muscles she manages to work...far better than just kegels although they are included)I need a day in between to let the muscles rest.Equipment: Comes with a strap, and they suggest a large ball and a small ball. A lot of time I settle for using a chair. The small ball is nicer than using a pillow, but really--a pillow and a chair will suffice. MOST EXERCISES only require a chair or large ball or no equipment at all.You can do these if you are not in shape...you just may need to not do all the reps at first.I am writing this review because so many more women need this--and I hope I can influence you to give it a shot. Think of it as a savings in urinary pads!! lol. I think it's a lot better than written instructions, as far as doing the exercises correctly, although written instructions to look back on might speed things up on busy days.",5,Puts regular kegels to shame!,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,1484,"['Struggling', 'incontinence', 'years', 'having', 'tried', 'Kegels', 'have', 'considered', 'getting', 'surgery', 'several', 'times', 'once', 'started', 'exercises', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'long', 'life', 'took', 'over', 'slowly', 'incontinence', 'returned', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'disk', 'start', 'just', 'did', 'again', 'GLAD.There', 'are', '3', 'sections.Educational', 'only', 'need', 'watch', 'once', 'good', 'information', 'Regular', 'exercises', '4', 'different', ""'workouts"", 'ranging', '10-23', 'minutes', 'Expect', 'spend', '20', 'minutes', 'most', 'days.Time', 'sensitive', 'exercises', 'where', 'have', 'slightly', 'shorter', 'versions', 'exercises.I', 'am', 'so', 'impressed', 'muscles', 'work', 'far', 'better', 'just', 'kegels', 'are', 'included', 'need', 'day', 'let', 'muscles', 'rest.Equipment', 'Comes', 'strap', 'suggest', 'large', 'ball', 'small', 'ball', 'lot', 'time', 'settle', 'using', 'chair', 'small', 'ball', 'nicer', 'using', 'pillow', 'really', 'pillow', 'chair', 'will', 'suffice', 'MOST', 'EXERCISES', 'only', 'chair', 'large', 'ball', 'equipment', 'all.You', 'can', 'do', 'are', 'not', 'shape', 'just', 'may', 'need', 'not', 'do', 'reps', 'first.I', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'women', 'need', 'hope', 'can', 'influence', 'give', 'shot', 'Think', 'savings', 'urinary', 'pads', 'lol', 'think', 'lot', 'better', 'written', 'instructions', 'as', 'far', 'doing', 'exercises', 'correctly', 'written', 'instructions', 'look', 'back', 'might', 'speed', 'things', 'up', 'busy', 'days']",Hab It: Pelvic Floor
