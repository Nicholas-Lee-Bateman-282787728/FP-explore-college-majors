434398,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,6304737505,Andrew Raker,"[2, 2]","Note: The following review assumes the reader has knowledge of Charles Dickens' novel ""Oliver Twist."" Therefore, be cautioned ~~ PLOT DETAILS are revealed.This is an approximately 90 minute Disney adaptation. It has some merits but numerous problems. To begin, the film deviates substantially from the novel. Secondly, the actors are not well-suited for their roles. This is especially true for Richard Dreyfuss, who plays Fagin.Because the film is for children, less than 90 minutes, and low-budgeted, many characters and scenes are eliminated. For example, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry do not exist in this production. Charles Bates, Mr. Monks, Mr. Grimwig, Toby, and Noah Claypole are also eliminated. Bulls-eye is not eliminated.The locket also plays an important role in this production. However, because Monks is not a character, Oliver actually takes the locket with him to London, where Fagin takes the locket and keeps it `safe' for Oliver. Afterward, Oliver strives to get the locket back to prove to Mr. Brownlow and Rose Maylie that he is related to them. It is important to note that Rose is Mr. Brownlow's niece in this film adaptation. Furthermore, Oliver's mother is Mr. Brownlow's daughter. Therefore, with the locket, Oliver could prove that he is Mr. Brownlow's grandson and heir.The film becomes slightly Shakespearean with the numerous psychological plot twists. For example, Oliver's allegiance is torn between Fagin, Sikes, Nancy, and the Dodger, each of whom abuses Oliver in some way, and Mr. Brownlow and Rose. The clearest abuse is from Sikes, who simply wants to exploit Oliver to (1) get back at Fagin, since Oliver knows where Fagin's treasure is hidden, and (2) use Oliver to rob Mr. Brownlow and/or people like him. Fagin, likewise, uses Oliver as he does other boys to rob and bring in money. Additionally, Fagin desires Oliver's locket, and does much to keep Oliver from getting it back.Furthermore, Oliver is not so innocent in this film. Oliver does help Sikes successful job Mr. Brownlow, even without having a gun put to his head. Secondly, Oliver does attempt to pick Mr. Brownlow's pocket at the bookstore (even though the Dodger ends up being the one who actually steals the wallet). Even before meeting Fagin, Oliver attempts to snatch an apple from a stand but is caught by Dawkins. Therefore, the theme of Oliver's innate goodness is not really legitimized in this adaptation. Oliver is seen as a typical lower-class boy torn among various allegiances.Sikes does murder Nancy in this film, although the murder takes place on a dock and not in Sikes' room. Furthermore, Sikes accidentally hangs himself in this film (one detail that makes the film better than the horrible 2007 BBC adaptation).Sikes is pure evil in this film. With the exception possibly the 2005 adaptation, I don't think any color adaptation exists with a more menacing Sikes. Sikes glorifies in being a master criminal. Sikes does not seem to care that he killed people in his life. Even Nancy's death does not seem to have as great an affect on Sikes as in the 2005 adaptation. Immediately before Sikes hangs himself, he flaunts how he is going to outmaneuver the police and the mob below.At the end of the film, Fagin is left to continue living his miserable misery existence. Fagin's treasure is not taken from him, although does get his locket back, which allows him to legitimize that he is Mr. Brownlow's grandson.Overall, film, shot in 4:3 ratio, has some merits and originality. However, it is very Disneyized.Personally, I recommend the 1985 BBC adaptation for people who seriously want the novel re-enacted as accurately as possible.For individuals who want an interested adaptation with an excellent picture quality (2.35:1 aspect ratio), I recommend the 2005 adaptation with Barney Clark and Ben Kingley.",2,Possibly good for children...but not students of Dickens,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,3824,"['Note', 'following', 'review', 'reader', 'knowledge', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'Therefore', 'be', 'cautioned', '~~', 'PLOT', 'DETAILS', 'are', 'revealed.This', 'approximately', '90', 'minute', 'Disney', 'adaptation', 'merits', 'numerous', 'problems', 'begin', 'film', 'substantially', 'novel', 'Secondly', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'well-suited', 'roles', 'especially', 'true', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'who', 'Fagin.Because', 'film', 'children', 'less', '90', 'minutes', 'low-budgeted', 'many', 'characters', 'scenes', 'are', 'eliminated', 'example', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Sowerberry', 'do', 'not', 'exist', 'production', 'Charles', 'Bates', 'Mr.', 'Monks', 'Mr.', 'Grimwig', 'Toby', 'Noah', 'Claypole', 'are', 'also', 'eliminated', 'Bulls-eye', 'not', 'eliminated.The', 'locket', 'also', 'important', 'role', 'production', 'However', 'Monks', 'not', 'character', 'Oliver', 'actually', 'locket', 'London', 'where', 'Fagin', 'locket', 'safe', 'Oliver', 'Afterward', 'Oliver', 'get', 'locket', 'back', 'prove', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'Rose', 'Maylie', 'related', 'important', 'note', 'Rose', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'niece', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Furthermore', 'Oliver', 'mother', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'daughter', 'Therefore', 'locket', 'Oliver', 'could', 'prove', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'grandson', 'heir.The', 'film', 'slightly', 'Shakespearean', 'numerous', 'psychological', 'plot', 'twists', 'example', 'Oliver', 'allegiance', 'torn', 'Fagin', 'Sikes', 'Nancy', 'Dodger', 'whom', 'abuses', 'Oliver', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'Rose', 'clearest', 'abuse', 'Sikes', 'who', 'simply', 'exploit', 'Oliver', '1', 'get', 'back', 'Fagin', 'Oliver', 'where', 'Fagin', 'treasure', 'hidden', '2', 'use', 'Oliver', 'rob', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'people', 'Fagin', 'likewise', 'Oliver', 'other', 'boys', 'rob', 'bring', 'money', 'Additionally', 'Fagin', 'Oliver', 'locket', 'much', 'keep', 'Oliver', 'getting', 'back.Furthermore', 'Oliver', 'not', 'so', 'innocent', 'film', 'Oliver', 'help', 'Sikes', 'successful', 'job', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'even', 'having', 'gun', 'put', 'head', 'Secondly', 'Oliver', 'attempt', 'pick', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'pocket', 'bookstore', 'even', 'Dodger', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'who', 'actually', 'wallet', 'Even', 'meeting', 'Fagin', 'Oliver', 'snatch', 'apple', 'stand', 'caught', 'Dawkins', 'Therefore', 'theme', 'Oliver', 'innate', 'goodness', 'not', 'really', 'legitimized', 'adaptation', 'Oliver', 'seen', 'typical', 'lower-class', 'boy', 'torn', 'various', 'allegiances.Sikes', 'murder', 'Nancy', 'film', 'murder', 'place', 'dock', 'not', 'Sikes', 'room', 'Furthermore', 'Sikes', 'accidentally', 'film', 'one', 'detail', 'film', 'better', 'horrible', '2007', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'pure', 'evil', 'film', 'exception', 'possibly', '2005', 'adaptation', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'color', 'adaptation', 'more', 'menacing', 'Sikes', 'Sikes', 'glorifies', 'being', 'master', 'criminal', 'Sikes', 'not', 'seem', 'care', 'killed', 'people', 'life', 'Even', 'Nancy', 'death', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'as', 'great', 'affect', 'Sikes', '2005', 'adaptation', 'Immediately', 'Sikes', 'hangs', 'how', 'going', 'outmaneuver', 'police', 'mob', 'end', 'film', 'Fagin', 'left', 'continue', 'living', 'miserable', 'misery', 'existence', 'Fagin', 'treasure', 'not', 'taken', 'get', 'locket', 'back', 'legitimize', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow', 'grandson.Overall', 'film', 'shot', '4:3', 'ratio', 'merits', 'originality', 'However', 'very', 'Disneyized.Personally', 'recommend', '1985', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'people', 'who', 'seriously', 'want', 'novel', 're-enacted', 'as', 'accurately', 'possible.For', 'individuals', 'who', 'want', 'interested', 'adaptation', 'excellent', 'picture', 'quality', '2.35:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'recommend', '2005', 'adaptation', 'Barney', 'Clark', 'Ben', 'Kingley']",Oliver Twist VHS
434399,AKUGGJWVJ8QMQ,6304737505,"Edward C. Patterson ""Edward C. Patterson""","[4, 5]","Charles Dickens has been served amply on film with all but two of his epic Novels (Dombey & Son and Barnaby Rudge) committed to at least one film. The Novella A Christmas Carol has had at least 20 treatments, and close behind it is Oliver Twist. Unfortunately, the Disney TV Oliver Twist does not serve Dickens well, having obliterated most of the delicate balance that the Novel maintains to have credibility. Well, we do forgive and overlook certain things with a classic, but the only contribution this film makes is the performance of Elijah Wood in a very different interpretation of Jack Dawkins, the Artful Dodger.The film lacks many main and important characters-Mr. Bumble, the Beetle being the most prominent. Some characters, like Mrs. Corney, are transposed into new roles to cover for missing characters. Disney's London is representational and Fagin's boys are not even sympathetic. Dickens created a world where the orphan is the victim of the environment-the baby farm, the workhouse, the fence, the courts, and prison. Oliver, Jack Dawkins, Bill Sikes and Fagin are the four stages of the fall into depravity at society's hands. Then, why, in this film don't we give a flip about Oliver? He doesn't even appear to be in danger. Maybe because the writers thought Oh, well, everyone knows this story. So let's just give them the parts they want to see and forget the rest. Unfortunately, the beef is removed and the broth has evaporated.Richard Dreyfuss gives us a caricature of Fagin-rarely threatening, never the tyrannical Jew that Dickens despised and scapegoated and, above all, let's him get away scot-free at the end. In the novel, Fagin goes to the gallows. But we mustn't show the kiddies that! Fagin's character never grows. In addition, Bill Sikes is never as psycho as Dickens portrayed him. David O'Hara presents us with a stage villain, who is more greed than certifiable. Alex Trench as Oliver walks through his role much like David Copperfield does. Except, Dickens' David Copperfield is one of literature blandest creations. Oliver is a harrowing role-purity under complete and utter assault. Not here folks.Elijah Wood, as the Artful Dodger, is the only actor who both entertains and performs, developing the character to its fullest. Unfortunately, since none of that character's arc is really Dickensian, it serves to heighten the fault with both script and the other performances, That leaves us with a frame for an Elijah Wood showcase.The sinister plot line that involves Oliver's true heritage is so obliterated in the film that the relationships between Mr. Brownlow and Oliver are actually stated as Grandson and Grandfather. There is no lurking Edward in the background. Rose is a sweet sister like figure instead of Oliver's aunt, haunted by the nightmare of her childhood. Even Mrs. Bedwin, a wonderful Dickens creation, becomes a minor housekeeper with two lines and a tea tray. Nancy, played by Antoine Byrne, is not half so good as she could be and none of the tense emotions that split her between lover and motherhood are presented. I guess we're suppose to have read the book and assume that they are there.So, what do we have in Disney's Oliver Twist? A thin remnant and bastardized story line from the original-washed faces, both the streets of London and its urchins, a merry old Fagin, a stage murderer, some milk toast ancillaries and a powerful Artful Dodger, who upstages the rest of the cast. Except for a glimpse of Elijah Wood's first adult performance and the intelligence of his stylings, stick to the older OT's-Dickie Moore and Jackie Cooper.

434402,A28ILXH590CMRJ,6304737505,Hazen B Markoe,"[25, 34]","OLIVER TWIST, the Charles Dickens novel of crime and childhood corruption in Victorian England, is perhaps one of the most adapted works in film.  With such classic characters such as the innocent Oliver Twist, the master-thief Fagin, the touching Nancy and the comical Mr. Bumble, adapting the novel to the screen has proved to be a filmmaker and actor's dream.  Probably the best versions out today are the classic 1951 David Lean version and the merry 1968 musical version, OLIVER!  Of course, there are many other film and TV versions as well.  This 1997 version produced by Walt Disney Co. for their ""Wonderful World of Disney"" TV show is unfortunately one of the lesser versions of this classic tale despite some handsome production values.Part of the reasoning of this low opinion stems from a rather rambling screenplay that almost completely changes the title character (played by Alex Trench) from a put-upon victim into an overly spunky and almost overly abrasive tyke.  It's not Trench's fault in that he does a good job with this rather false characterization, but he ends up seeming more suited to playing the Artful Dodger than Oliver Twist.  In contrast, Elijah Wood's performance as the Artful Dodger comes across as overly mannered and laid back.  As a result, his Dodger seems ill-equipped emotionally to be a ""street educated"" tough.The pivotal role of Fagin, that master teacher of young pickpockets, has undergone much revision since Dickens first created him.  Originally a slimy, nasty Jewish stereotype, the character has been softened to the point of sometimes being comic relief.  Of course, this is due to modern sensibilities that have dictated the de-emphasis on racial stereotypes. That in itself isn't a bad thing as Ron Moody's masterful performance in OLIVER! showed, but Richard Dreyfus seems ill-prepared in the role.  Wandering around in a false nose and gravelly voice, Dreyfus is inconsistent in the role and turns a star turn into something merely average.  David O' Hara and Antoine Byrne are more successful in their roles of the brutal Bill Sikes and his ill-fated lover, Nancy.  Unfortunately, the screenplay gives these characters rather short shift and they don't get much of a chance to make an impression.  Indeed, the movie streamlines the classic story to an almost absurd degree with the elimination of classic characters and situations such as Mr. Bumble and Oliver's apprenticeship to the funeral parlor of the cruel Sowerberrys.At about 90 minutes, the movie seems to go faster than it does because of the absurd trimming.  The Walt Disney Company does not do the classic story justice and leaves the viewer feeling very unsatisfied as a result.  This movie may be handsome to look at, but this is not a version that I would recommend.  Stick with the classic David Lean or 1968 musical version for a better and more satisfying experience.",2,Disney version is TWISTed beyond belief.,1082678400,"04 23, 2004",2004,2893,"['OLIVER', 'TWIST', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'crime', 'childhood', 'corruption', 'Victorian', 'England', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'adapted', 'works', 'film', 'such', 'classic', 'characters', 'such', 'innocent', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'master-thief', 'Fagin', 'touching', 'Nancy', 'comical', 'Mr.', 'Bumble', 'adapting', 'novel', 'screen', 'proved', 'be', 'filmmaker', 'actor', 'dream', 'Probably', 'best', 'versions', 'out', 'today', 'are', 'classic', '1951', 'David', 'Lean', 'version', 'merry', '1968', 'musical', 'version', 'OLIVER', 'course', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'film', 'TV', 'versions', 'well', '1997', 'version', 'produced', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Co.', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'TV', 'show', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'lesser', 'versions', 'classic', 'tale', 'handsome', 'production', 'values.Part', 'reasoning', 'low', 'opinion', 'rather', 'rambling', 'screenplay', 'almost', 'completely', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'Alex', 'Trench', 'put-upon', 'victim', 'overly', 'spunky', 'almost', 'overly', 'abrasive', 'tyke', 'not', 'Trench', 'fault', 'good', 'job', 'rather', 'false', 'characterization', 'up', 'seeming', 'more', 'suited', 'playing', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'contrast', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'performance', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'overly', 'mannered', 'laid', 'back', 'result', 'Dodger', 'ill-equipped', 'emotionally', 'be', 'street', 'educated', 'tough.The', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Fagin', 'master', 'teacher', 'young', 'pickpockets', 'undergone', 'much', 'revision', 'Dickens', 'first', 'created', 'Originally', 'slimy', 'nasty', 'Jewish', 'stereotype', 'character', 'been', 'softened', 'point', 'sometimes', 'being', 'comic', 'relief', 'course', 'due', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'have', 'dictated', 'de-emphasis', 'racial', 'stereotypes', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'Ron', 'Moody', 'masterful', 'performance', 'OLIVER', 'showed', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'ill-prepared', 'role', 'Wandering', 'around', 'false', 'nose', 'gravelly', 'voice', 'Dreyfus', 'inconsistent', 'role', 'star', 'turn', 'something', 'merely', 'average', 'David', 'O', 'Hara', 'Antoine', 'Byrne', 'are', 'more', 'successful', 'roles', 'brutal', 'Bill', 'Sikes', 'ill-fated', 'lover', 'Nancy', 'Unfortunately', 'screenplay', 'characters', 'rather', 'short', 'shift', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'chance', 'make', 'impression', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'classic', 'story', 'almost', 'absurd', 'degree', 'elimination', 'classic', 'characters', 'situations', 'such', 'Mr.', 'Bumble', 'Oliver', 'apprenticeship', 'funeral', 'parlor', 'cruel', 'Sowerberrys.At', '90', 'minutes', 'movie', 'go', 'faster', 'absurd', 'trimming', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Company', 'not', 'do', 'classic', 'story', 'justice', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'very', 'unsatisfied', 'result', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'handsome', 'look', 'not', 'version', 'would', 'recommend', 'Stick', 'classic', 'David', 'Lean', '1968', 'musical', 'version', 'better', 'more', 'satisfying', 'experience']",Oliver Twist VHS

This is maybe the best family film based on Dicken's classic story of Oliver. With excessive characters and side-plots done away with in recrafting the main plot, it's less dense without being too fluffy, and it's gritty enough without being (as the novel is, at times) frighteningly violent. Most of the actors carry their parts well, except for the man who played as Bill Sykes, and the child actor who played as Oliver. Elijah Wood did good acting, with his facial expressions and body-language delivering the right emotions at the right time, and though his accent wasn't the most brilliant I've ever heard, he was entirely consistent in his usage of it, which is saying a lot! He fell short, due to misguided directing, of living up to the name of ""Artful Dodger"". It was very, very silly to have him leading around such a huge band of little theives. In real life, they would have made the police suspicious and been arrested within an hour . . . but that wasn't Wood's fault. In the book Fagin sent the boys out in either alone or in small groups. The Artful and Charley Bates were a twosome, and then when Oliver joined them they were a trio -- and the Artful always made sure they remained inconspicuous. As for Sykes, this movie's interpretation of him was so cartoonish it was all but laughable. Sykes in the book was less ranting and more cruely sarcastic, less of a raving hot-head and more coldly menacing. Though he often was hysterically violent, the creepy thing about him was that his *bite* was always worse than his *bark*. Fagin is a lost cause -- he is not Dicken's Fagin. But the actor carried well the part of the Fagin custom-made for this movie. The one thing that should definately have been changed was the potrayel of Oliver: the child actor who played him was as composed in all the filth and violence as a school-boy who just stepped off the bus.",4,"Oliver Comes ""Home""",1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,1967,"['would', 'give', 'review', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'could', ""'ve"", 'got', 'settle', 'tentative', '4', 'maybe', 'best', 'family', 'film', 'based', 'Dicken', 'classic', 'story', 'Oliver', 'excessive', 'characters', 'side-plots', 'done', 'away', 'recrafting', 'main', 'plot', 'less', 'dense', 'being', 'too', 'fluffy', 'gritty', 'enough', 'being', 'novel', 'times', 'frighteningly', 'violent', 'Most', 'actors', 'carry', 'parts', 'well', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'child', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Oliver', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'did', 'good', 'acting', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body-language', 'delivering', 'right', 'emotions', 'right', 'time', 'accent', 'was', ""n't"", 'most', 'brilliant', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'was', 'entirely', 'consistent', 'usage', 'saying', 'lot', 'fell', 'short', 'due', 'misguided', 'directing', 'living', 'up', 'name', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'silly', 'have', 'leading', 'around', 'huge', 'band', 'little', 'theives', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'police', 'suspicious', 'been', 'arrested', 'hour', 'was', ""n't"", 'Wood', 'fault', 'book', 'Fagin', 'sent', 'boys', 'out', 'alone', 'small', 'groups', 'Artful', 'Charley', 'Bates', 'were', 'twosome', 'then', 'when', 'Oliver', 'joined', 'were', 'trio', 'Artful', 'always', 'made', 'sure', 'remained', 'inconspicuous', 'Sykes', 'movie', 'interpretation', 'was', 'so', 'cartoonish', 'was', 'laughable', 'Sykes', 'book', 'was', 'less', 'ranting', 'more', 'cruely', 'sarcastic', 'less', 'raving', 'hot-head', 'more', 'coldly', 'menacing', 'often', 'was', 'hysterically', 'violent', 'creepy', 'thing', 'was', '*bite*', 'was', 'always', 'worse', '*bark*', 'Fagin', 'lost', 'cause', 'not', 'Dicken', 'Fagin', 'actor', 'carried', 'well', 'part', 'Fagin', 'custom-made', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'should', 'definately', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'was', 'potrayel', 'Oliver', 'child', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'was', 'composed', 'filth', 'violence', 'school-boy', 'who', 'just', 'stepped', 'off', 'bus']",Oliver Twist VHS
