1033840,AXMPEQ7QHVBBL,B000KGGIZA,Elizabeth Brown,"[5, 5]","Sleeping With the Enemy is a pretty good movie about an abused wife (Roberts) and her journey out of her marriage.  It has some level of suspense to it.  Dying Young, which I had never heard of before ordering this duo, was actually not bad.  A young man hires a caregiver (Roberts), and a relationship ensues.  It's not edge of your seat excitement, but I found it to be pretty good.
