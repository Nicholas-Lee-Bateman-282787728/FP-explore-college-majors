It viewed more like a made for TV movie.Here's the scoop. Treat Williams suspects his unbalanced son might be responsible for several murders. Son is unbalanced due to the loss of his mother in a house fire when he was 6 years old. But the story goes deeper and the son might be unbalanced due to other reasons while dad might play a bigger part in this than is immediately apparent.The script is quite good. There are several factors at play and a good job is done juggling them and introducing them at key times to keep things interesting. It really had me going well into the third act. Treat Williams is a veteran actor and delivers his lines well. Johnathan Jackson, as his son Seth, is really good. He's a real wiener early on and gives you the creeps. As much as he does to make the viewer dislike him, there is that shadow of a doubt concerning his guilt. Linda Hamilton does what she can, but her part isn't written all that well.This is a good, solid piece. The New Hampshire locations are used well. All the production values are decent. Again, it just needed that certain something to make it rise above a made for TV movie. It's more three and a half stars as opposed to the three I gave it but it's a worth while view if you like mystery thrillers.",3,Good Story.

I'm trying to remember, but I think when Wayne introduced the film at Nodance (in the Main St. Mall, Park City, UT), I thought he said it was shot on Hi-Def... I can't remember. Anyways, the plot is sometimes cliche-riding, but it's still a wonderful and sorta disturbing ride. Nice, nice stuff. Kinda like an audience-friendly Lynch rendition of a back-stabbing, twisted family noir made for tv. Still, it's darn good.",4,Saw it at Nodance too!

660165,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00005JRMY,Michael Butts,"[4, 4]","A man fears his son is a serial killer; the son plays on this and torments his father; is he the culprit or is it the father?  That is the premise in this low-key, yet tense and enthralling psychological drama.  The answer is rather predictable, but thanks to the intense performances by Treat Williams, Linda Hamilton and Jonathan Jackson, the movie grabs you and doesn't let up until it's last mesmerizing scene.  Williams has aged nicely, maintaining that handsome leading man quality, but has gone a little pudgy and hangs on to that guy next door persona.  Hamilton, looking a little tired and older,nonetheless conveys a quiet sexuality and seems to enjoy her character; Jackson switches from smart-mouthed brat to the abused victim rather effectively.  The direction is terse and not ostentatious, Powers letting the story tell itself.A tight little overlooked film.",5,OUT OF THE CLOSET,1073692800,"01 10, 2004",2004,873,"['man', 'son', 'serial', 'killer', 'son', 'father', 'culprit', 'father', 'premise', 'low-key', 'tense', 'enthralling', 'psychological', 'drama', 'answer', 'rather', 'predictable', 'thanks', 'intense', 'performances', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'Jonathan', 'Jackson', 'movie', 'grabs', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'last', 'mesmerizing', 'scene', 'Williams', 'aged', 'nicely', 'maintaining', 'handsome', 'leading', 'man', 'quality', 'gone', 'little', 'pudgy', 'hangs', 'guy', 'next', 'door', 'persona', 'Hamilton', 'looking', 'little', 'tired', 'older', 'nonetheless', 'quiet', 'sexuality', 'enjoy', 'character', 'Jackson', 'smart-mouthed', 'brat', 'abused', 'victim', 'rather', 'effectively', 'direction', 'terse', 'not', 'ostentatious', 'Powers', 'letting', 'story', 'tell', 'itself.A', 'tight', 'little', 'overlooked', 'film']",N/A

For me, the volume was so low on the dialogue often I could not understand what the actors were saying. The script seemed  poorly written & the development of the characters was very superficial. There was no real final resolution at the end - but that may have been becuase the dialogue was so hard to uncerstand, the music often overshadowing it. The movie was very confusing, the credibility of the main characters never established.Highly not recommended for viewing.",2,Confusing,1351036800,"10 24, 2012",2012,541,"['As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'bothering', 'review', 'volume', 'was', 'so', 'low', 'dialogue', 'often', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'actors', 'were', 'saying', 'script', 'seemed', 'poorly', 'written', 'development', 'characters', 'was', 'very', 'superficial', 'was', 'real', 'final', 'resolution', 'end', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'dialogue', 'was', 'so', 'hard', 'uncerstand', 'music', 'often', 'overshadowing', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'confusing', 'credibility', 'main', 'characters', 'never', 'established.Highly', 'not', 'recommended', 'viewing']",N/A
660167,A3C2WKP1LZKMU,B00005JRMY,"Tammy L. Schilling ""tammyl84""","[3, 6]","Skeletons in the Closet is a head-game style flick asking: Who's the Bad Guy?  The father of a disturbed teenager starts to believe that his son is a serial killer.  The son, for his part,  seems to enjoy messing with his father's head.  Linda Hamilton plays the father's girlfriend, who is caught in the middle between father and son, with both telling her that the other is paranoid.Overall, this movie was a bit over reaching and predictable.  There were no surprises and the script fails to deliver on the potential drama of the story.  The acting in this movie is quite good and does help to deliver it from made for TV status.  In fact, I have to wonder what Linda Hamilton was doing in this movie at all.  Either her career is on the way down or her agent needs to suggest that she be more picky with her roles.  Truly, her character could have been fully eliminated from the script without really losing anything.I say go ahead and watch.  It's not too bad, if you don't expect too much.  It will at least help you to burn a couple of hours with some mindless entertainment.  We all need that sometimes.For DVD collectors: This DVD has basically nothing of interest.  There are no extras beyond production notes, cast&amp;crew, and the trailer.
