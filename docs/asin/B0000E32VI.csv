781088,A3NNOIDMGBH4MW,B0000E32VI,"Ashton ""Multoc.com""","[3, 3]","This Dvd is really good, it has many more featurs than Live Dosage.  Sure, once again, Chad's voice is not the best (I wish they had taken a day off before they filmed this, because I saw them live in Detroit, where they had taken a day off, and Chad hit every note his voice never broke).  But the over all sound and presence of the dvd is superb.  I love it, and I'm sure every Mudvayne fan will too. The DVD has many more features than on the last DVD.  It feautures interview with the band(who seem to be very childish at times, especially Ryan, but it works and has a lot of humor)their crew and fans.  The behind the scenes of ""World So Cold"" is disapointing, and not as in-depth as I would have hoped.  Also the music video for ""World So Cold"" is not mixed in 5.1 which was a disapointement, but that was the same thing for Live Dosage.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who is into technical music (Bass players or Drummers especially) Because this band has two of the most well crafted players out there.  Enjoy, and ROCK ON!",5,Much better than Live Dosage,1068681600,"11 13, 2003",2003,1032,"['Dvd', 'really', 'good', 'many', 'more', 'featurs', 'Live', 'Dosage', 'Sure', 'once', 'again', 'Chad', 'voice', 'not', 'best', 'wish', 'had', 'taken', 'day', 'off', 'filmed', 'saw', 'live', 'Detroit', 'where', 'had', 'taken', 'day', 'Chad', 'hit', 'note', 'voice', 'never', 'broke', 'sound', 'presence', 'dvd', 'superb', 'love', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Mudvayne', 'fan', 'will', 'too', 'DVD', 'many', 'more', 'features', 'last', 'DVD', 'interview', 'band', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'childish', 'times', 'especially', 'Ryan', 'lot', 'humor', 'crew', 'fans', 'scenes', 'World', 'So', 'Cold', 'disapointing', 'not', 'as', 'in-depth', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'Also', 'music', 'video', 'World', 'So', 'Cold', 'not', 'mixed', '5.1', 'was', 'disapointement', 'was', 'same', 'thing', 'Live', 'Dosage', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'technical', 'music', 'Bass', 'players', 'Drummers', 'especially', 'band', 'two', 'most', 'well', 'crafted', 'players', 'there', 'Enjoy', 'ROCK', 'ON']",Mudvayne - All Access To All Things
781089,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B0000E32VI,Brett Corkins,"[2, 2]","I love Mudvayne, they're one of my favorite bands, but this DVD is merely above par. The concert portion is pretty good, despite some sound quality issues. I thought the vocals overpowered the band, and I also thought the vocals were lacking. The behind-the-scenes footage between the songs was okay, but it mainly consisted of ""Get that camera out of here."" The high-point of this footage was the interview with Matt, the drummer. It shows just how intellectual he is. The World So Cold video is very good. One of the best metal videos I've seen in recent years. But once again, the behind-the-scenes of this video wasn't very good. I am really glad that they don't open up entirely to the camera though. That's a sign of a true metal band in my opinion. The Mudcam is pretty good. No big complaints there.Now as anyone can see, the songs they chose to play live are impecable. It highlights their career very well (minus Beginning Of All Things). As I said earlier though, the performance as a whole is less than stellar. Chad has the ability to reach the screams he does on CDs live, and he shows that ability here, but he sounds so out of breath the entire time. The band would sound as near to perfect as you can get, if you could just hear them. The bass is very prominent, the drums are less, but you can still make them out pretty easily. The guitar however, almost sounds like it's not even there. Greg is a good guitarist, not groundbreaking, but still good. I don't know if they thought it sounded good in rehearsal and something just went wrong or what, but that's something they should've corrected.All in all they did a good job with this DVD. They leaned more for L.D. 50 songs than they did The Beginning..., but hey, L.D. 50 is a better CD. The songs they did play from The Beginning... were some of the best ones from that disc though. The songs they performed the best were -1, Death Blooms, Not Falling, and World So Cold. It's worth the money, I'll say that, but let's hope the next DVD they release has better quality sound.",4,Is it wrong that I don't love this?,1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,2046,"['love', 'Mudvayne', ""'re"", 'one', 'favorite', 'bands', 'DVD', 'merely', 'above', 'par', 'concert', 'portion', 'pretty', 'good', 'sound', 'quality', 'issues', 'thought', 'vocals', 'overpowered', 'band', 'also', 'thought', 'vocals', 'were', 'lacking', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'songs', 'was', 'okay', 'mainly', 'consisted', 'Get', 'here', 'high-point', 'footage', 'was', 'interview', 'Matt', 'drummer', 'just', 'how', 'intellectual', 'World', 'So', 'Cold', 'video', 'very', 'good', 'One', 'best', 'metal', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'once', 'again', 'behind-the-scenes', 'video', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'am', 'really', 'glad', 'do', ""n't"", 'open', 'up', 'entirely', 'camera', 'sign', 'true', 'metal', 'band', 'opinion', 'Mudcam', 'pretty', 'good', 'big', 'complaints', 'there.Now', 'anyone', 'can', 'see', 'songs', 'chose', 'play', 'live', 'are', 'impecable', 'highlights', 'career', 'very', 'well', 'Beginning', 'All', 'Things', 'said', 'earlier', 'performance', 'whole', 'less', 'stellar', 'Chad', 'ability', 'reach', 'screams', 'CDs', 'live', 'ability', 'here', 'so', 'breath', 'entire', 'time', 'band', 'would', 'sound', 'near', 'perfect', 'can', 'get', 'could', 'just', 'hear', 'bass', 'very', 'prominent', 'drums', 'are', 'less', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'out', 'pretty', 'easily', 'guitar', 'however', 'almost', 'not', 'even', 'there', 'Greg', 'good', 'guitarist', 'not', 'groundbreaking', 'still', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'thought', 'sounded', 'good', 'rehearsal', 'something', 'just', 'went', 'wrong', 'what', 'something', 'should', ""'ve"", 'corrected.All', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'DVD', 'leaned', 'more', 'L.D', '50', 'songs', 'did', 'Beginning', 'hey', 'L.D', '50', 'better', 'CD', 'songs', 'did', 'play', 'Beginning', 'were', 'best', 'ones', 'disc', 'songs', 'performed', 'best', 'were', '-1', 'Death', 'Blooms', 'Not', 'Falling', 'World', 'So', 'Cold', 'money', ""'ll"", 'say', 'let', 'hope', 'next', 'DVD', 'release', 'better', 'quality', 'sound']",Mudvayne - All Access To All Things

781091,AXF0OX50YZQC6,B0000E32VI,Rebecca Lyle,"[33, 33]","This is one great DVD.  This is not near as strictly a live DVD as Mudvayne's Live Dosage release.  On All Access To All Things you get to get much more personal with the band and their everyday life on tour.First off, let me review the live portion of the DVD.  You get ten live songs:Internal Primates Forever-1SilencedDeath BloomsMercy, SeverityCradleNothing To GeinWorld So ColdNot FallingDigAs you can see, it's a great selection of songs.  They were all recorded at the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and are all performed during the day time.  The sound quality is much better than their previous live DVD, especially Chad's vocals.  Chad sounds fantastic compared to Live Dosage.  Another cool thing is the fact that they no longer wear make up onstage.  They look just look like regular guys.  These performances are proof that Mudvayne is a great performing band with massive amounts of talent and energy.The performances are all very spaced out with the Behind The Scenes Footage put in between.  I really enjoyed the Behind The Scenes stuff that goes on.  You have footage of the band before and after the show, during interviews, on the tour bus, all kinds of crazy stuff.  It's great to see that this group of  rock stars are really pretty cool and calm guys.  I found Matt to be extremely intelligent, especially his little discussion on how technology has helped benefit music.  He really seems to know what he's talking about, and really seems to be an interesting guy.You also get the World So Cold Video as well as a making of feature.  World So Cold is a wonderful song and the video is great.  I really think of this as a nice addition to the DVD.To sum this all up, this is the best DVD release yet from Mudvayne.  If you are a fan of the band, you will love this release.",5,All Access To All Things,1075075200,"01 26, 2004",2004,1791,"['one', 'great', 'DVD', 'not', 'as', 'strictly', 'live', 'DVD', 'Mudvayne', 'Live', 'Dosage', 'release', 'Access', 'All', 'Things', 'get', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'band', 'everyday', 'life', 'tour.First', 'off', 'let', 'review', 'live', 'portion', 'DVD', 'get', 'ten', 'live', 'songs', 'Internal', 'Forever-1SilencedDeath', 'BloomsMercy', 'SeverityCradleNothing', 'GeinWorld', 'So', 'ColdNot', 'FallingDigAs', 'can', 'see', 'great', 'selection', 'songs', 'were', 'recorded', 'Summer', 'Sanitarium', 'Tour', '2003', 'are', 'performed', 'day', 'time', 'sound', 'quality', 'much', 'better', 'previous', 'live', 'DVD', 'especially', 'Chad', 'vocals', 'Chad', 'fantastic', 'compared', 'Live', 'Dosage', 'cool', 'thing', 'fact', 'longer', 'wear', 'make', 'up', 'onstage', 'look', 'just', 'look', 'regular', 'guys', 'performances', 'are', 'proof', 'Mudvayne', 'great', 'performing', 'band', 'massive', 'amounts', 'talent', 'energy.The', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'spaced', 'out', 'Behind', 'Scenes', 'Footage', 'put', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Behind', 'Scenes', 'stuff', 'have', 'footage', 'band', 'show', 'interviews', 'tour', 'bus', 'kinds', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'great', 'see', 'group', 'rock', 'stars', 'are', 'really', 'pretty', 'cool', 'calm', 'guys', 'found', 'Matt', 'be', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'especially', 'little', 'discussion', 'how', 'technology', 'helped', 'benefit', 'music', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'talking', 'really', 'be', 'interesting', 'guy.You', 'also', 'get', 'World', 'So', 'Cold', 'Video', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'feature', 'World', 'So', 'Cold', 'wonderful', 'song', 'video', 'great', 'really', 'think', 'nice', 'addition', 'DVD.To', 'sum', 'up', 'best', 'DVD', 'release', 'yet', 'Mudvayne', 'are', 'fan', 'band', 'will', 'love', 'release']",Mudvayne - All Access To All Things
