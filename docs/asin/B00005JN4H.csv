I dunno why, but I was convinced I didn't care for her as an actor.  I was wrong.Latifah plays Belle, an adrenalin addicted cab driver who's anxious to begin her career as a NYC cabbie in her souped up Ford Crown Victoria, yet despite her female macho outer shell, she's really a romantic softie at heart.  Her character, despite being larger then life (come on... how many overweight black females actually ride as a bike courier in NYC?) is also not the typical paper-thin, one dimensional empty shell that so many comedy roles are.  And her role perfectly complements the male lead.Jimmy Fallon plays police detective Washburn, and he does such a fantastic job of playing a pathetic little dweeb of a cop that more then once I wanted Latifah to pound his skinny little a@@. The comedy kicks in when Washburn, who drives worse then a 90 year old grandma, looses his license and gets a demotion.  He manages to hook up with Belle and her crown vic, and together the two unwilling partners must team up to stop a band of bank robbers.Okay, so there's nothing deep or profound about the movie, but, Latifah and Fallon are talented comedians and together they make for a lot of laughs and a fun ninety minutes.Enjoy!",4,QUEEN Latifah reigns supreme!,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,1289,"['must', 'confess', 'first', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'dunno', 'why', 'was', 'convinced', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'actor', 'was', 'wrong.Latifah', 'plays', 'Belle', 'adrenalin', 'addicted', 'cab', 'driver', 'who', 'anxious', 'begin', 'career', 'NYC', 'cabbie', 'souped', 'up', 'Ford', 'Crown', 'Victoria', 'yet', 'female', 'macho', 'outer', 'shell', 'really', 'romantic', 'softie', 'heart', 'character', 'being', 'larger', 'then', 'life', 'come', 'how', 'many', 'overweight', 'black', 'females', 'actually', 'ride', 'bike', 'courier', 'NYC', 'also', 'not', 'typical', 'paper-thin', 'one', 'dimensional', 'empty', 'shell', 'so', 'many', 'comedy', 'roles', 'are', 'role', 'perfectly', 'male', 'lead.Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'police', 'detective', 'Washburn', 'fantastic', 'job', 'playing', 'pathetic', 'little', 'dweeb', 'cop', 'more', 'then', 'once', 'wanted', 'Latifah', 'pound', 'skinny', 'little', '@', '@', 'comedy', 'kicks', 'when', 'Washburn', 'who', 'worse', 'then', '90', 'year', 'old', 'grandma', 'license', 'demotion', 'hook', 'up', 'Belle', 'crown', 'vic', 'together', 'two', 'unwilling', 'partners', 'must', 'team', 'up', 'stop', 'band', 'bank', 'robbers.Okay', 'nothing', 'deep', 'profound', 'movie', 'Latifah', 'Fallon', 'are', 'talented', 'comedians', 'together', 'make', 'lot', 'laughs', 'fun', 'ninety', 'minutes.Enjoy']",Taxi

626685,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JN4H,Craig Matteson,"[4, 6]","This movie is another proof that a comedy does not have to be plausible or even have a good plot to make us laugh.  To keep this kind of silliness in the air the movie depends on the delight created by the stars.  Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon bring energy and fun to this lame brained comedy.  From the opening bicycle messenger sequence under the titles to the very last outtake there is nothing in this movie that makes much sense let alone a speck of plausibility.Yet, you just like watching Queen Latifah occupying the screen.  Yes, we would like watching her all the more in a better movie, but sometimes it is OK to have fun being silly.  Her souped up taxi is silly, that she can zoom through downtown traffic is silly, that Fallon could be a cop with all his foibles is even sillier, and there is a lot more in this movie that is even dumber including the Super Villains being attracted to bank robbing.  Fallon is not as delightful as Queen Latifah, but makes his feckless cop into someone you almost care about.  He and Queen Latifah do have some chemistry as a comedy team.But who cares?  This is not a movie about realism.  It is playing pretend and setting up silly situations that we can laugh at.  That Ann Margret as Fallon's constantly intoxicated mom can make drunkenness funny at all is an achievement in today's MADD world.If you want to turn off your brain for a bit and understand that all your enjoyment will be destroyed the moment your plausibility circuitry evaluates anything you are seeing on the screen, this should work for you.  If you can't then this is a one or two star movie that will drive you crazy.

Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah fans will see the best and the worst of both stars.  What you won't see is any consistency in this film.Taxi is a movie that seems to change directors from day-to-day filming; there are scenes that have all the excitement and star quality of a ""Lethal Weapon"", and there are scenes that have all the drabness of a daytime soap opera.Jimmy Fallon plays a cop who is not a very good driver and has an ex-girlfriend (so he says) for a boss.  Their banter is not the least bit entertaining, even though I believe it is supposed to be.Queen Latifah plays a bike courieor who finally gets her cabbie license.  QL is an excellent actress, and at times I almost felt like she was doing everything in her power to carry this film.  I think she is so appealing to the masses because she seems like such a ""down-to-earth"" person.  She has a real charm on the screen.Fallon's character has some truly funny moments: The huge pile-up of cars when he tries do commandeer a citizen's vehicle and his alcoholic mother are amusing, but these good spots are rare.The whole movie seemed to need a rewrite.  I didn't hate this movie, but I definitely didn't think it was all it could have been.  Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon are so talented that it takes an amazing script to utilize their talents.  I would advise them both to be more picky with their scripts.So all and all...If there is nothing else to buy or rent, try this movie.

626692,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00005JN4H,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[2, 3]","""Taxi"" is a ridiculous movie based on a series of ridiculous French films by Luc ""Transporter"" Besson.  I don't know what aspect of the story is the most bizarre: that the New York banks are being robbed by Portuguese bikini models, Queen Latifah having bike skills that'll pounce Mat Hoffman, a taxicab that acts like a transformer, or Jimmy Fallon as a cop?  My money's on Jimmy Fallon.  In fact, if there's one thing that would ruin an otherwise run-of-the-mill popcorn flick, it would be that guy.  His attempt at comedy is about as effective at tickling my funny bone as a sledgehammer, and it's just as painful.  His character does nothing but cause problems instead of solving them: he can't drive a car, he charges into enemy headquarters, and he patronizing with armed criminals.  He's an insignificant nuisance, and even if he does grow out of these problems with the help of a Natalie Cole song, he's still a humorless character with no trace of charm; I sorta wished Jennifer Esposito's character (wearing a low-cut top for a lieutenant) would just fire him at his first offense.Why couldn't this movie be all about Queen Latifah?  Her wisecracks need to be diminished, but she's more than capable in getting the job done on her own.  She knows where she had to go, she has her people to scout the area, she understands the mind of a criminal, and she drives like Nascar; that woman's a better cop that Fallon is, and she's just a cabbie.  I know this set-up of the incompetant/competent pair is deliberate, but all this incompetent fellow did was look at a map.  If the movie has to be another ebony-and-ivory buddy cop flick, why couldn't she team up with Mel Gibson?  He may be controversial in recent times, but I can trust that psycho over this comedian.As far as ""Taxi"" goes, the sensual nature of the villains and the cast made it too silly, and too much of its humor is about two leads arguing; they're not funny, and they go on like clockwork.  But the car chases were entertaining, even if they are absurdly planned.

626695,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B00005JN4H,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[2, 4]","""Taxi"" is the kind of movie that you feel was made in a day. It is definetly one hundred percent entertaining, but it isn't good. It has some funny moments, but that's about it. I liked Jimmy Fallon, though. If he doesn't pick such idiotic things to be in, he could be a pretty good actor. He could follow in the footsteps of Will Farrell, the man who has eleven movies on the slate to be made in the next two years. Queen Latifah had two hits, and now she's killing her career in such bad roles. ""Bringing Down the House"" and ""Chicago"" were both great movies, but now she's bringing HERSELF down to ""Taxi,"" and ""The Cookout"" which I also give three stars. The number one problem with this is that it never knew which direction it was going. It tried to cram every single cliche into it's nintety seven minute running time, including bloopers at the end to make it seem that the cast had such a great time shooting this movie. It had alot of pointless scenes, including the last scene at a NASCAR race, which Jimmy Fallon and anthor cast member Jennifer Esposito are dressed as Lord knows what because they are undercover. She is another actress that has high potential, but chooses movies that could bring her down, like ""The Master of Diguise."" The special effects really aren't that great either, and it's obvious that the car crashes have been faked. Finally, I cannot stand the opening scene. There is somebody on a motorcycle, driving around town, jumping on trains, over a bridge, and finally she rips off her helment and its. . . Queen Latifah. It obviously wasn't her on the motorcycle, but we've seen that a million times, so it's nothing new. Just another cliche.Jimmy Fallon stars as Officer Andy Washburn. He gets into a little trouble, since he is not so good at driving. He crashes into someone's fruit stand while undercover, and wrecks a few cars at the same time. His boss Marta, who also used to be his girlfriend, demotes him to a regular cop, but when he hears of a bank robbery on the radio, he decides he must take action, considering he is only a few blocks away. He tries to get a car, but gets into more trouble, so he gets into a taxicab, run by Belle. She could get anywhere fast, and now she has this custom made cab, built for speed. They see the robbers, three Brazilian bank robbers who dress as men to rob banks. Of course, Belle can speak their language, because it was part of one of her jobs a long time ago. The police take Belle's cab as evidence, and now Washburn offers a deal with her. He will get her cab back, if she helps him foil the bank robbers, and get back into the clear at the office. She agrees.""Taxi"" is based on, I think, three French movies of the same name. Now, all you have heard from this is that I hated the movie, and yet I gave it three stars. That is, because it's entertaining. I had fun watching this, even though I've seen the same things over and over again. I laughed a few times, but it only merits a fair rating. Tim Story directed it, and he directed the fair ""Barbershop,"" but he missed out on the great ""Barbershop 2 Back in Business."" I'm starting to think that maybe I don't like this guy as a director, and he should move onto better material.

Thus begins the arduous journey of our two co-stars.As you can surmise, the robbers successfully escape; Fallon is relieved of duty; Latifah loses her cab, and both must rely on each other to catch the guys (or in this case, bad girls).As in any buddy picture, the movie is only successful if the chemistry works between the stars.

Hollywood is suffering a real dry spell when it comes to new blood as most stuff we get now is from previously released material. Some remakes can be impressive (Dawn of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and others can be downright pointless (Alfie!). Taxi is an obscure choice.The original French version was written by Luc Besson in 21 days out of pure boredom as he waited for Columbia to greenlight The Fifth Element. It was an okay, silly action movie that spawned 2 sequels itself. While it's a mildly popular film it's hardly the kind of thing that warrants an American remake. How many Americans (or anyone outside of France) cared for the original Taxi? As ramshackle as it is, Taxi NYC still seems to hold together thanks to the energetic performances of Queen Latifa and Jimmy Fallon. They do what the can with the limp material and are capable of duping you into believing that the movie is better than it really is. What's so bad about it? Well, the plot is non-existent and is really just a set-up for a couple of brief chase scenes featuring Latifa's suped-up Taxi. Director Tim Story tries to copy the easy-going pastel-colored design and liberated use of widescreen photography of the original as well as keeping the speed of the chases as fast as he can but the stuff in between is so dated and his direction feels like the kind of quality film-making you'd expect of Rush Hour 86. Plus, the sexuality of the original film has been erased. In France this would have been called harmless but in America they call it pornography.It's hard to give this film a bad review as there is at least one good laugh per scene but the cheap, cruddiness of it prevents it from being anything more than a one-time only rental that won't really hold up upon repeat viewings. Trust me.The DVD is in great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with good enough Dolby 5.1 sound. The sound design is hardly anything to write home about so don't expect to. The DVD I watched (Region 2-which has a much cooler box than that ugly-ass Region 1 cover) had an extended version of the film that ran 6 minutes longer.

I mean seriously, a taxi cab with Super-Pursuit mode? But, it did show a potential for car chases and babes, so we gave it a shot, and boy are we glad we did!The movie starts off with some great bike riding, and we're not talking Jesse James bikes here, we're talking about a courier on a bicycle riding through the streets (and stores and subways) of New York City . This courier turns out to be Belle (Queen Latifah) who amazingly enough looked a lot thinner when doing all those bike stunts... anyway, Belle is finishing up her last day as a courier as she's starting a new career as a taxi driver.Turns out Belle is a bit of a gearhead, and apparently an electronics wiz, design guru, bodywork genius and professional driver as well&#65533; amazing that the only job she's held up to this point is as a courier. After strapping a supercharger to her taxi before turning in for the night, Belle is ready for her first day at work. The first passenger we see her take is a bossy white dude who wants to get from Time Square to the Airport in 15 min. No problem of course as this taxi would put KITT to shame. A panel pops up out of the console, bodywork changes before our eyes, the wheels change and she attaches a MOMO racing wheel to the steering column. Time to drive! OK, it's really silly but darn amusing to watch happen. Of course she makes it, scaring the crap out of her passenger in the process.Next up is Detective Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) who is about to screw up a bust. Wait? Did I just spoil the movie for you? Could it be possible that the detective in the movie isn't a screwup at the beginning of the movie who will just happen to save the day by the end? Nah, you knew all that already, you're a guy. So Washburn screws things up and in the process has his drivers license taken away. The next time we see him he hears a radio call for officers to respond to a bank robbery. He's only a couple of blocks away, but doesn't have a car. He's young and appears in good shape, so of course he grabs a taxi for those two blocks. Yes, it's Belle.From this point on Belle and Washburn are reluctant partners trying to solve a bank robbery. All typical buddy-cop stuff, but it's very well done. Why on earth did this one get 4 stars? Well, the car chases are very well done, the humor is consistent, and there's a priceless girl-girl moment that moved it from 3 to 4 stars.Give it a go, you'll have a good time.",4,I've never gotten a cab like this in New York,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,2495,"['have', 'admit', 'previews', 'make', 'movie', 'look', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'mean', 'seriously', 'taxi', 'cab', 'Super-Pursuit', 'mode', 'did', 'show', 'potential', 'car', 'chases', 'babes', 'gave', 'shot', 'boy', 'are', 'glad', 'did', 'movie', 'off', 'great', 'bike', 'riding', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'Jesse', 'James', 'bikes', 'here', ""'re"", 'talking', 'courier', 'bicycle', 'riding', 'streets', 'stores', 'subways', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'courier', 'out', 'be', 'Belle', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'amazingly', 'enough', 'looked', 'lot', 'thinner', 'when', 'doing', 'stunts', 'anyway', 'Belle', 'finishing', 'up', 'last', 'day', 'courier', 'starting', 'new', 'career', 'taxi', 'out', 'Belle', 'bit', 'gearhead', 'apparently', 'electronics', 'wiz', 'design', 'guru', 'bodywork', 'genius', 'professional', 'driver', 'well', '65533', 'amazing', 'only', 'job', 'held', 'up', 'point', 'courier', 'strapping', 'supercharger', 'taxi', 'turning', 'night', 'Belle', 'ready', 'first', 'day', 'work', 'first', 'passenger', 'see', 'take', 'bossy', 'white', 'dude', 'who', 'get', 'Time', 'Square', 'Airport', '15', 'min', 'problem', 'course', 'taxi', 'would', 'put', 'KITT', 'shame', 'panel', 'up', 'console', 'bodywork', 'changes', 'eyes', 'wheels', 'change', 'MOMO', 'racing', 'wheel', 'steering', 'column', 'Time', 'drive', 'OK', 'really', 'silly', 'darn', 'amusing', 'watch', 'happen', 'course', 'scaring', 'crap', 'passenger', 'process.Next', 'up', 'Detective', 'Washburn', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'who', 'screw', 'up', 'bust', 'Wait', 'Did', 'just', 'spoil', 'movie', 'Could', 'be', 'possible', 'detective', 'movie', ""n't"", 'screwup', 'beginning', 'movie', 'who', 'will', 'just', 'happen', 'save', 'day', 'end', 'Nah', 'knew', 'already', ""'re"", 'guy', 'So', 'Washburn', 'screws', 'things', 'up', 'process', 'drivers', 'license', 'taken', 'away', 'next', 'time', 'see', 'radio', 'call', 'officers', 'respond', 'bank', 'robbery', 'only', 'couple', 'blocks', 'away', ""n't"", 'have', 'car', 'young', 'good', 'shape', 'course', 'taxi', 'two', 'blocks', 'Yes', 'Belle.From', 'point', 'Belle', 'Washburn', 'are', 'reluctant', 'partners', 'trying', 'solve', 'bank', 'robbery', 'typical', 'buddy-cop', 'stuff', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Why', 'earth', 'did', 'one', 'get', '4', 'stars', 'Well', 'car', 'chases', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'humor', 'consistent', 'priceless', 'girl-girl', 'moment', 'moved', '3', '4', 'stars.Give', 'go', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'time']",Taxi

626717,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JN4H,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 11]","Dreams and aspirations often indicate what kind of profession a person intends to pursue.  In Taxi, which is a remake, the audience gets to follow two people with very different aspirations, one a cab driver and the other a police officer. Belle (Queen Latifah) has worked hard over the last five years, as a bike borne delivery woman, to accomplish her goal to become a cab driver.  The long and hard work has also affected Belle's relationship with her boyfriend, as she has been preoccupied with fulfilling her dream.  Her dream is to drive her own cab, a boosted Ford Crown Victoria on steroids in superior James Bond style.Police detective Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) finds himself being demoted and having his driver's license suspended by his superior, Lieutenant Robbins (Jennifer Esposito), as a result of a car accident during a stake out.  Without a drivers license Washburn is forced to use public transportation, but when he overhears a bank robbery in progress over his portable radio he takes a cab to the crime scene.  This cab happens to be Belle's improved Crown Victoria, and it is about to put her career and relationship on the line while Washburn keeps digging himself a deeper hole.Together Belle and Washburn begin a long uphill road in order to redeem themselves in regards to their professional careers and private lives.  This journey takes them through eye-boggling car chases, death defiant stunts, and a couple of lessons in how to drive a car.  These dangers are stitched together with slapstick humor and frequent situational jokes in regards to Washburn's stupidity, insecurities, and inabilities.  The humor and jokes are clich&eacute;s from previous unoriginal films, which makes the jokes more mind numbing than humorous.  The timing of the jokes seems to be missed, as if the audience knows the punch line before the joke is presented.  This makes much of the humor silly, untimely, and overall less funny.Taxi presents some high-speed car chases in New York, but many of them seem to go on forever as if New York City had mile blocks.  The bank robbers' ability to hit targets the size of a quarter in 100 feet distances while moving with a handgun presents a new level of sharp shooter.  These marksmen make Sergeant Riggs in Lethal Weapon look like a ten-year-old that still wets the bed.  Therefore, these scenes create much awkwardness and it appears that the car chases and the other action scenes were intended to induce some form of suspense, but fail drastically in doing so.The combination of humor and action has been used efficiently before in films such as 48 Hrs. (1982), Beverly Hills Cop (1984), Lethal Weapon (1987), and Die Hard (1988).  In Naked Gun (1988) the viewers could see parody in action, as it made a mockery of the films made before that brought the audience action, suspense, and comedy through the law enforcement.  Taxi attempts to deliver a film that walks on the ground in between the parodies and suspenseful actions, but never accomplishes to give suspense or comedy.  And as far as the message of following ones dreams and aspirations, well, it is lost somewhere in the beginning.  Overall Taxi offers a cinematic experience with very little true humor and suspense and would even make a nervous person fall asleep. Let us hope that Tim Story does a better job directing his upcoming Fantastic Four, as he did with Barbershop (2002).",1,Comedy Misfires and Suspense Fails...,1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,3403,"['Dreams', 'aspirations', 'often', 'indicate', 'what', 'kind', 'profession', 'person', 'pursue', 'Taxi', 'remake', 'audience', 'follow', 'two', 'people', 'very', 'different', 'aspirations', 'one', 'cab', 'driver', 'other', 'police', 'officer', 'Belle', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'worked', 'hard', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'bike', 'borne', 'delivery', 'woman', 'accomplish', 'goal', 'become', 'cab', 'driver', 'long', 'hard', 'work', 'also', 'affected', 'Belle', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'been', 'preoccupied', 'fulfilling', 'dream', 'dream', 'drive', 'own', 'cab', 'boosted', 'Ford', 'Crown', 'Victoria', 'steroids', 'superior', 'James', 'Bond', 'style.Police', 'detective', 'Washburn', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'being', 'demoted', 'having', 'driver', 'license', 'suspended', 'superior', 'Lieutenant', 'Robbins', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'result', 'car', 'accident', 'stake', 'out', 'drivers', 'license', 'Washburn', 'forced', 'use', 'public', 'transportation', 'when', 'bank', 'robbery', 'progress', 'portable', 'radio', 'cab', 'crime', 'scene', 'cab', 'be', 'Belle', 'improved', 'Crown', 'Victoria', 'put', 'career', 'relationship', 'line', 'Washburn', 'digging', 'deeper', 'hole.Together', 'Belle', 'Washburn', 'begin', 'long', 'uphill', 'road', 'order', 'redeem', 'regards', 'professional', 'careers', 'private', 'lives', 'journey', 'eye-boggling', 'car', 'chases', 'death', 'defiant', 'stunts', 'couple', 'lessons', 'how', 'drive', 'car', 'dangers', 'are', 'stitched', 'together', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'frequent', 'situational', 'jokes', 'regards', 'Washburn', 'stupidity', 'insecurities', 'inabilities', 'humor', 'jokes', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'previous', 'unoriginal', 'films', 'jokes', 'more', 'numbing', 'humorous', 'timing', 'jokes', 'be', 'missed', 'audience', 'punch', 'line', 'joke', 'presented', 'much', 'humor', 'silly', 'untimely', 'overall', 'less', 'funny.Taxi', 'presents', 'high-speed', 'car', 'chases', 'New', 'York', 'many', 'seem', 'go', 'forever', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'had', 'mile', 'blocks', 'bank', 'robbers', 'ability', 'hit', 'targets', 'size', 'quarter', '100', 'feet', 'distances', 'moving', 'handgun', 'new', 'level', 'sharp', 'shooter', 'marksmen', 'make', 'Sergeant', 'Riggs', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'look', 'ten-year-old', 'still', 'bed', 'Therefore', 'scenes', 'create', 'much', 'awkwardness', 'car', 'chases', 'other', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'intended', 'induce', 'form', 'suspense', 'fail', 'drastically', 'doing', 'so.The', 'combination', 'humor', 'action', 'been', 'used', 'efficiently', 'films', 'such', '48', 'Hrs', '1982', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', '1984', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', '1987', 'Die', 'Hard', '1988', 'Naked', 'Gun', '1988', 'viewers', 'could', 'see', 'parody', 'action', 'made', 'mockery', 'films', 'made', 'brought', 'audience', 'action', 'suspense', 'comedy', 'law', 'enforcement', 'Taxi', 'attempts', 'deliver', 'film', 'ground', 'parodies', 'suspenseful', 'actions', 'never', 'accomplishes', 'give', 'suspense', 'comedy', 'as', 'far', 'message', 'following', 'ones', 'dreams', 'aspirations', 'well', 'lost', 'somewhere', 'beginning', 'Overall', 'Taxi', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'very', 'little', 'true', 'humor', 'suspense', 'would', 'even', 'make', 'nervous', 'person', 'fall', 'asleep', 'Let', 'hope', 'Tim', 'Story', 'better', 'job', 'directing', 'upcoming', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'did', 'Barbershop', '2002']",Taxi

Queen Latifah struts her stuff gloriously as novice cabbie Belle Williams who dreams one day of being a NASCAR driver.  Jimmy Fallon is fun as Detective Washburn, a bumbling accident prone cop who couldn't drive a vehicle if his life depended on it.

Flying through the streets of New York in her tricked-out taxi, she's earned a rep as New York's fastest cabbie. But driving a hack is only a pit stop for her real dream: Belle wants to be a race car champion. And she's well on her way, until she's derailed by overeager cop Andy Washburn, whose undercover skills are matched only by his total ineptitude behind the wheel. Washburn, whose lack of vehicular skills has landed him in the precinct doghouse, is hot on the heels of a gang of beautiful Brazilian bank robbers, led by Vanessa, their cold, calculating and leggy leader. To nab the evasive crooks, drivers license less Washburn convinces Belle to team up with him to pursue Vanessa and crew. Belle has carte blanche to drive at any speed and break any law. The car less cop and speed demon cabbie New York's unlikeliest partners begin a high-speed game of cat and mouse with the robbers.

626746,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JN4H,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 7]","The 2004 US version 'Taxi' looks almost like a blurred copy of its original, 1998 French comedy of the same title.  The original became a hit series, spawning two sequels 'TAXI 2' and 'TAXI 3,' and this remake.  The difference is that the new story is set in New York City, and the taxi driver is played by Queen Latifah, Oscar-nominee of 'Chicago.'French filmmaker Luc Besson (who directed 'The Fifth Element') produced both films (and wrote the original's script too), and let me be honest with you, his writing is far from an original or inspired one, but the original was an often funny buddy-buddy film with one fast MALE driver and one MALE bumbling cop.For American version, which someone thought should be more ethnically-diversed, Latifah plays a NWC taxi driver Bell, into whose car a 'good-cop-but-worst-driver' Washburn (SNL's Jimmy Fallon) stumbles, in order to chase the four bank robbers.  Of course, as he is a bumbling cop, the results are just  disasterous ... a bad sign for the film itself.Anyway they will team up to catch them, to redeem his pride and her car (and perhaps money), and we see in the next 90 minutes the bantering between Latifah and Fallon, plus some obligatory love interest from Jenniffer Esposito (as Fallon's boss and ex), and the guest appearance from Ann-Margret as Fallon's mom.SO many formulas, you might say.  But the original WAS very formulaic, so anyway the director Tim Story ('Barbershop') has no chance from the beginning.  At least, the original (which I saw several times) had used them better way, letting the actors show their likable sides, making the pair very amusing.  Though the two leads in the US version are likable and affable enough here too, their characters look more forced and elaborated in New York City.  (Did you see a taxi running like racing car  there?)The worst thing is, however, the portraits of the bank robbers, whose gun-holding Brazilian supermodel-like characters are way too ridiculous even in this escapist entertainment.  And know know, model-turned-actress Gisele Bunschen driving BMW?  Like 100 mph?  Even more embarrassing is a 'body-search' scene between Esposito and Bunchen, which looks like a footage from pay-per-view TV.Not everything is bad, I say.  Car stunts are good though some might think the original did it better.  Still, considering the more crowded urban streets, the stunts are as good as the ones in the French one.  And the end credits which feature the outtakes are very funny, which means that you have to wait for them to see the funniest part, though.Looking at these recycled materials, I cannot help feeling that if someone is holding back the US release of the original (even on DVDs), he does it intentionally to have us see this inferior one.  Wait for the release of the French version -- hope they will someday -- which is far better, I can assure you.And M. Besson, please let no more remakes happen.  Did you really give OK to remake your noir masterpiece 'La Femme Nikita' which became ... er ... a weak copycat 'Point of No Return'?",2,"Good Car Stunts, But Poorly Written Remake of French Comedy",1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,3058,"['2004', 'US', 'version', ""'Taxi"", 'almost', 'blurred', 'copy', 'original', '1998', 'French', 'comedy', 'same', 'title', 'original', 'became', 'hit', 'series', 'spawning', 'two', 'sequels', '2', '3', 'remake', 'difference', 'new', 'story', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'taxi', 'driver', 'played', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Oscar-nominee', ""'Chicago"", 'filmmaker', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'who', 'directed', ""'The"", 'Fifth', 'Element', 'produced', 'films', 'wrote', 'original', 'script', 'too', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'writing', 'far', 'original', 'inspired', 'one', 'original', 'was', 'often', 'funny', 'buddy-buddy', 'film', 'one', 'fast', 'MALE', 'driver', 'one', 'MALE', 'bumbling', 'cop.For', 'American', 'version', 'someone', 'thought', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'ethnically-diversed', 'Latifah', 'NWC', 'taxi', 'driver', 'Bell', 'car', ""'good-cop-but-worst-driver"", 'Washburn', 'SNL', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'stumbles', 'order', 'chase', 'four', 'bank', 'robbers', 'course', 'bumbling', 'cop', 'results', 'are', 'just', 'disasterous', 'bad', 'sign', 'film', 'itself.Anyway', 'will', 'team', 'up', 'catch', 'redeem', 'pride', 'car', 'perhaps', 'money', 'see', 'next', '90', 'minutes', 'bantering', 'Latifah', 'Fallon', 'obligatory', 'love', 'interest', 'Jenniffer', 'Esposito', 'Fallon', 'boss', 'ex', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Ann-Margret', 'Fallon', 'mom.SO', 'many', 'formulas', 'might', 'say', 'original', 'WAS', 'very', 'formulaic', 'so', 'anyway', 'director', 'Tim', 'Story', ""'Barbershop"", 'chance', 'beginning', 'least', 'original', 'saw', 'several', 'times', 'had', 'used', 'better', 'way', 'letting', 'actors', 'show', 'likable', 'sides', 'making', 'pair', 'very', 'amusing', 'two', 'leads', 'US', 'version', 'are', 'likable', 'affable', 'enough', 'here', 'too', 'characters', 'look', 'more', 'forced', 'elaborated', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Did', 'see', 'taxi', 'running', 'racing', 'car', 'there', 'worst', 'thing', 'however', 'portraits', 'bank', 'robbers', 'gun-holding', 'Brazilian', 'supermodel-like', 'characters', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'even', 'escapist', 'entertainment', 'know', 'know', 'model-turned-actress', 'Gisele', 'Bunschen', 'driving', 'BMW', '100', 'mph', 'Even', 'more', 'embarrassing', ""'body-search"", 'scene', 'Esposito', 'Bunchen', 'footage', 'pay-per-view', 'TV.Not', 'everything', 'bad', 'say', 'Car', 'stunts', 'are', 'good', 'might', 'think', 'original', 'did', 'better', 'Still', 'considering', 'more', 'crowded', 'urban', 'streets', 'stunts', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'ones', 'French', 'one', 'end', 'credits', 'feature', 'outtakes', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'funniest', 'part', 'though.Looking', 'recycled', 'materials', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feeling', 'someone', 'holding', 'back', 'US', 'release', 'original', 'even', 'DVDs', 'intentionally', 'have', 'see', 'inferior', 'one', 'Wait', 'release', 'French', 'version', 'hope', 'will', 'someday', 'far', 'better', 'can', 'assure', 'you.And', 'M.', 'Besson', 'please', 'let', 'more', 'remakes', 'happen', 'Did', 'really', 'give', 'OK', 'remake', 'noir', 'masterpiece', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'became', 'er', 'weak', 'copycat', ""'Point"", 'No', 'Return']",Taxi
