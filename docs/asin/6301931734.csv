273094,A3CJKTAXF2JT1,6301931734,Classic Movie Lady,"[0, 0]","This 1923 Buster Keaton feature has a little something for everyone, historical accuracy, scenic beauty, great story, amazing visual humor and breathtakingly dangerous stunts.The prologue begins in rural Kentucky in the year 1810.  The wealthy Canfield family, and the poor McKay family, are locked in a generational feud.  When a Canfield brother and the lone patriarch of the McKay family are killed on a rainy night, the Canfields swear revenge, while the McKay widow flees with her baby son Willie to avoid any more bloodshed.Twenty years pass by, and Willie McKay (Buster Keaton) is now a grown man, who was raised by his aunt after his mother passed away. He is sent a letter by an attorney telling him that he needs to travel to Kentucky to claim his father's estate.  Imagining that the estate is a big, Southern plantation, Willie decides to make the trip.  His aunt tells him about the feud, and makes him promise her that he will stay away from the CanfieldsWhile on the long train journey (the train was a rebuilt replica of Stevenson's Rocket engine), Willie rides in the same coach with a pretty young lady (Natalie Talmadge)  that he becomes sweet on.  He is blissfully unaware that she is Canfield, and she doesn't know he is a McKay, and ends up inviting him over to her house for supper.  When her father (Big Joe Roberts) and brother's find out who he is, they do what they can to try and kill him.  Being Southern gentlemen, however, it was against their honor code to kill Willie while he was a guest in their home.  Once young McKay figured out what was going on, he decided to become a permanent house guest.There is much more that happens, but I am not one for giving away spoilers.  There are some thrilling water stunts in this film that were not only dangerous, but  were almost fatal for Keaton, who of all the comedians of his time, did more dangerous water stunts than any of them.There was a scene where Buster was in a raging river.  The cameras were set at the water's edge.  The cameramen were never allowed to stop shooting unless Buster yelled, ""Cut"" first.  They had a hold back wire attached to Buster, so he would travel down the river at the same rate of speed that the camera was going.  In the film, you can see where the wire snapped, and Buster is violently carried off by the water, over the rocks and through the rapids.  He managed to get to the edge to hold onto a branch, and that was the only thing that saved him from drowning.  Another dangerous stunt was when he had to rescue Natalie's character before she is swept over the falls herself.  He inhaled so much water during the stunt that a doctor had to administer first aid.This film was a family affair for Keaton.  Buster's infant son plays baby Willie McKay in the prologue.  His first wife, Natalie Talmadge, was his leading lady (She was also pregnant with their second son at that time), and his father, Joe Keaton, also had a small role.  Sadly, long time friend and actor Joe Roberts, who played the Canfield patriarch and many of the heavies in Keaton's short films, died of a stroke shortly after this film wrapped.Although Our Hospitality was not as well known as his later works, it is definitely a well made, fast paced, comedy thriller that is a small glimpse into  Buster Keaton's future greatness.",5,A Keaton Styled Family Feud,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,3318,"['1923', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'feature', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'scenic', 'beauty', 'great', 'story', 'amazing', 'visual', 'humor', 'breathtakingly', 'dangerous', 'stunts.The', 'prologue', 'rural', 'Kentucky', 'year', '1810', 'wealthy', 'Canfield', 'family', 'poor', 'McKay', 'family', 'are', 'locked', 'generational', 'feud', 'When', 'Canfield', 'brother', 'lone', 'patriarch', 'McKay', 'family', 'are', 'killed', 'rainy', 'night', 'Canfields', 'swear', 'revenge', 'McKay', 'widow', 'flees', 'baby', 'son', 'Willie', 'avoid', 'more', 'bloodshed.Twenty', 'years', 'pass', 'Willie', 'McKay', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'now', 'grown', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'aunt', 'mother', 'passed', 'away', 'sent', 'letter', 'attorney', 'telling', 'travel', 'Kentucky', 'claim', 'father', 'estate', 'Imagining', 'estate', 'big', 'Southern', 'plantation', 'Willie', 'make', 'trip', 'aunt', 'feud', 'promise', 'will', 'stay', 'away', 'CanfieldsWhile', 'long', 'train', 'journey', 'train', 'was', 'rebuilt', 'replica', 'Stevenson', 'Rocket', 'engine', 'Willie', 'same', 'coach', 'pretty', 'young', 'lady', 'Natalie', 'Talmadge', 'sweet', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'Canfield', ""n't"", 'know', 'McKay', 'up', 'inviting', 'house', 'supper', 'When', 'father', 'Big', 'Joe', 'Roberts', 'brother', 'find', 'who', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'try', 'kill', 'Being', 'Southern', 'gentlemen', 'however', 'was', 'honor', 'code', 'kill', 'Willie', 'was', 'guest', 'home', 'Once', 'young', 'McKay', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'decided', 'become', 'permanent', 'house', 'much', 'more', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'are', 'thrilling', 'water', 'stunts', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'dangerous', 'were', 'almost', 'fatal', 'Keaton', 'who', 'comedians', 'time', 'did', 'more', 'dangerous', 'water', 'stunts', 'them.There', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Buster', 'was', 'raging', 'river', 'cameras', 'were', 'set', 'water', 'edge', 'cameramen', 'were', 'never', 'allowed', 'stop', 'shooting', 'Buster', 'yelled', 'Cut', 'first', 'had', 'hold', 'back', 'wire', 'attached', 'Buster', 'would', 'travel', 'river', 'same', 'rate', 'speed', 'camera', 'was', 'going', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'wire', 'snapped', 'Buster', 'violently', 'carried', 'off', 'water', 'rocks', 'rapids', 'managed', 'get', 'edge', 'hold', 'branch', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'saved', 'drowning', 'dangerous', 'stunt', 'was', 'when', 'had', 'rescue', 'Natalie', 'character', 'swept', 'falls', 'inhaled', 'so', 'much', 'water', 'stunt', 'doctor', 'had', 'administer', 'first', 'aid.This', 'film', 'was', 'family', 'affair', 'Keaton', 'Buster', 'infant', 'son', 'plays', 'baby', 'Willie', 'McKay', 'prologue', 'first', 'wife', 'Natalie', 'Talmadge', 'was', 'leading', 'lady', 'was', 'also', 'pregnant', 'second', 'son', 'time', 'father', 'Joe', 'Keaton', 'also', 'had', 'small', 'role', 'Sadly', 'long', 'time', 'friend', 'actor', 'Joe', 'Roberts', 'who', 'played', 'Canfield', 'patriarch', 'many', 'heavies', 'Keaton', 'short', 'films', 'died', 'stroke', 'shortly', 'film', 'Hospitality', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'later', 'definitely', 'well', 'made', 'fast', 'paced', 'comedy', 'thriller', 'small', 'glimpse', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'future', 'greatness']",N/A
273095,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6301931734,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 3]","OUR HOSPITALITY (writ./dir. Buster Keaton, 1923, 73 minutes) is another favorite of mine given to us by the immortal Buster Keaton. I rank this with hisThe General (The Ultimate Two-Disc Edition)andOur Hospitality/Sherlock, Jr.(I recommend this awesome two-fer DVD set). HOSPITALITY is BK's first great feature-length film, though he had already done a couple of them.Set in the Antebellum South (1830, Keaton was impossibly ahead of his time making this period authentic-looking) Buster plays Willie McKay, a New York-bred unwilling member of the old Canfield-McKay feud. (Yes, loosely based on the Hatfield-McCoy feud that really lasted only a few years.)Returning to Kentucky to claim his inheritance (an ""estate"" that will make you howl with laughter when you see it), Willie soon falls right into the arms of the waiting Canfields. They are, of course, waiting to kill him. Luckily for him he is already sweet on the young Canfield girl (played by his 1st wife Natalie Talmage Keaton) and this will save him later. Uniquely, Buster's son Buster, Jr., plays him at age 1.There is a waterfall scene in this, and all I'll tell you is Keaton designed and had built the entire thing on one of his lots. Goes to show you, alongside works like THE GENERAL, what Keaton was capable of achieving. You will marvel at Keaton's partly rebuilt, partly restored Stephenson's Rocket locomotive ... and yes, they really did ride those once upon a time.Another bittersweet detail: Joe Roberts (Old Man Canfield), a dear friend and traditional heavy in Keaton's films, suffered a heart attack while filming. He insisted on returning to finish the film - and died very shortly after they wrapped. Keaton's films are filled with disasters, hair-raising, realistic and funny as hell. Just as often they are filled with tragedies: in this film, along with Roberts' heart attack, Keaton was brutally carried off by water and almost drowned. The scene remains in the film.While this does not have the accolades of THE GENERAL (then again, how could it), no one can miss watching it. Here for the first time, Keaton experiments fully with his signature lighting, model sets and daring camera shots. The acting is refreshing and surprising: everyone seems extremely realistic except for good old Roberts, bless him. Once in a while Keaton had to have the Old Schoolers in there too. Although it certainly does not quite reach the heights of THE GENERAL, this is Buster Keaton at his prime!How can anyone remotely interested in film miss this?!",5,The Keaton's Real McCoy,1317513600,"10 2, 2011",2011,2522,"['OUR', 'HOSPITALITY', 'writ./dir', 'Buster', 'Keaton', '1923', '73', 'minutes', 'favorite', 'mine', 'given', 'immortal', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'rank', 'hisThe', 'General', 'Ultimate', 'Two-Disc', 'Edition', 'andOur', 'Hospitality/Sherlock', 'Jr.', 'recommend', 'awesome', 'two-fer', 'DVD', 'set', 'HOSPITALITY', 'BK', 'first', 'great', 'feature-length', 'film', 'had', 'already', 'done', 'couple', 'them.Set', 'Antebellum', 'South', '1830', 'Keaton', 'was', 'impossibly', 'ahead', 'time', 'making', 'period', 'authentic-looking', 'Buster', 'Willie', 'McKay', 'New', 'York-bred', 'unwilling', 'member', 'old', 'Canfield-McKay', 'feud', 'Yes', 'loosely', 'based', 'Hatfield-McCoy', 'feud', 'really', 'lasted', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'Returning', 'Kentucky', 'claim', 'inheritance', 'estate', 'will', 'make', 'howl', 'laughter', 'when', 'see', 'Willie', 'soon', 'right', 'arms', 'waiting', 'Canfields', 'are', 'course', 'waiting', 'kill', 'Luckily', 'already', 'sweet', 'young', 'Canfield', 'girl', 'played', '1st', 'wife', 'Natalie', 'Talmage', 'Keaton', 'will', 'save', 'later', 'Uniquely', 'Buster', 'son', 'Buster', 'Jr.', 'age', '1.There', 'waterfall', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'Keaton', 'designed', 'had', 'built', 'entire', 'thing', 'one', 'lots', 'Goes', 'show', 'alongside', 'THE', 'GENERAL', 'what', 'Keaton', 'was', 'capable', 'achieving', 'will', 'marvel', 'Keaton', 'partly', 'partly', 'restored', 'Stephenson', 'Rocket', 'locomotive', 'yes', 'really', 'did', 'ride', 'once', 'time.Another', 'bittersweet', 'detail', 'Joe', 'Roberts', 'Old', 'Man', 'Canfield', 'dear', 'friend', 'traditional', 'heavy', 'Keaton', 'films', 'suffered', 'heart', 'attack', 'filming', 'insisted', 'returning', 'finish', 'film', 'died', 'very', 'shortly', 'wrapped', 'Keaton', 'films', 'are', 'filled', 'disasters', 'hair-raising', 'realistic', 'funny', 'hell', 'Just', 'often', 'are', 'filled', 'tragedies', 'film', 'Roberts', 'heart', 'attack', 'Keaton', 'was', 'brutally', 'carried', 'off', 'water', 'almost', 'drowned', 'scene', 'film.While', 'not', 'have', 'accolades', 'THE', 'GENERAL', 'then', 'again', 'how', 'could', 'one', 'can', 'miss', 'watching', 'Here', 'first', 'time', 'Keaton', 'fully', 'signature', 'lighting', 'model', 'sets', 'daring', 'camera', 'shots', 'acting', 'refreshing', 'surprising', 'everyone', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'good', 'old', 'Roberts', 'bless', 'Once', 'while', 'Keaton', 'had', 'have', 'Old', 'Schoolers', 'there', 'too', 'certainly', 'not', 'quite', 'reach', 'heights', 'THE', 'GENERAL', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'prime', 'How', 'can', 'anyone', 'remotely', 'interested', 'film', 'miss']",N/A
273096,A2YNT4QDEQX30F,6301931734,H. Snyder,"[0, 0]","Buster Keaton's first feature-length film to tell a complete and continuous story, Our Hospitality was inspired by the Hatfield and McCoy feud of the 1860s-70s. In this film the antagonists are the ""Canfields"" and the ""McKays"", and the time period is the early 1800s. The time shift allowed Keaton to use two technological facts of the era, namely the arrival of the earliest railroads and the use of pistols that required reloading after every shot. Keaton's previous film, Three Ages, was produced in 1923, the same year as Our Hospitality. Three Ages was purposely stitched together from three short films so that they could be sold separately if the feature-length version was not successful. In Our Hospitality, Keaton first reached the level of inventiveness, artistic control, and technological boldness that was to mark his films for the next five years, until the sound age rendered almost all of the great silent comedians more or less obsolete. In this brief time Keaton created some of the finest comedies ever produced.A major and recurring feature of Our Hospitality is an antique railroad train, built specifically for this production. The engine is based on a British design from 1829, while the ""carriages"" were based on an American example from 1831. You never saw such a railroad, where the tracks can be pulled aside to get around a stubborn burro, or go up and over a fallen tree. The stalwart engineer of this railroad is Joe Keaton, Buster's father. After departing New York, once safely arrived in Kentucky young Willie McKay (Keaton) finds himself in the midst of a decades-old feud. Invited to dinner by a girl he befriended on the train, Willie finds that she, her father and her brothers are Canfields, sworn enemies of the McKays. The men are determined to kill Willie at the earliest opportunity, but ""our hospitality"" will not permit killing him while he is a guest in their house.The ensuing chases and adventures involve diving into a deep lake (likely Lake Tahoe), being swept down a swift river (the Truckee River, near Lake Tahoe), and over a waterfall. Although the waterfall is a constructed set, it is still 30 feet high, and Keaton does his strenuous and difficult stunts at this height. The care and thought that went into this film are indicated by the meticulous costumes and sets, as well as the intricate and expensive props. Although Keaton had a long apprenticeship in vaudeville and short films, it appeared to the audiences of 1923 that his genius had exploded onto the screen fully developed in Our Hospitality. Over the next five years the sets in his films got larger, the stunts more outrageous and dangerous, and Keaton's fame soared along with the cost of his films.Extras in this Kino edition of Our Hospitality include a documentary on the making of the film; and an alternate 49-minute cut entitled simply ""Hospitality"" which is thought to be a working copy, missing many of the comic elements that were in the longer version. Also included is a 19 minute film entitled ""The Iron Mule"". Produced in 1925 by Keaton's mentor Fatty Arbuckle, this film utilizes the antique train from Our Hospitality, and Keaton appears in at least one and perhaps as many as four cameos.(The following paragraph contains observations about Keaton that I attach to all of my reviews of his films.) Charlie Chaplin was the graceful mime, Harold Lloyd was the surprisingly athletic everyman, and Buster Keaton was The Great Stone Face. His expression never varied, but his acrobat's body performed the most astounding knockabout comedy and genuinely dangerous stunts in cinema. Other stars had stunt doubles, but Keaton not only performed his own stunts, he sometimes did the stunts for other actors in his films as well. With the advent of sound Keaton's star faded, but has returned to full brilliance since his death, as restored versions of his films have become available for home video. One of Hollywood's true originals and a genius of motion picture inventiveness, Buster Keaton has secured a place of honor in the history of film, and in the hearts of his growing number of fans.",5,"""We Can't Kill Him While He is a Guest in Our House""",1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,4124,"['Buster', 'Keaton', 'first', 'feature-length', 'film', 'tell', 'complete', 'continuous', 'story', 'Hospitality', 'was', 'inspired', 'Hatfield', 'McCoy', 'feud', '1860s-70s', 'film', 'antagonists', 'are', 'Canfields', 'McKays', 'time', 'period', 'early', '1800s', 'time', 'shift', 'allowed', 'Keaton', 'use', 'two', 'technological', 'facts', 'era', 'namely', 'arrival', 'earliest', 'railroads', 'use', 'pistols', 'required', 'reloading', 'shot', 'Keaton', 'previous', 'film', 'Three', 'Ages', 'was', 'produced', '1923', 'same', 'year', 'Hospitality', 'Three', 'Ages', 'was', 'purposely', 'stitched', 'together', 'three', 'short', 'films', 'could', 'be', 'sold', 'separately', 'feature-length', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'successful', 'Hospitality', 'Keaton', 'first', 'reached', 'level', 'inventiveness', 'artistic', 'control', 'technological', 'boldness', 'was', 'mark', 'films', 'next', 'five', 'years', 'sound', 'age', 'rendered', 'almost', 'great', 'silent', 'comedians', 'more', 'less', 'obsolete', 'brief', 'time', 'Keaton', 'created', 'finest', 'comedies', 'ever', 'produced.A', 'major', 'recurring', 'feature', 'Hospitality', 'antique', 'railroad', 'train', 'built', 'specifically', 'production', 'engine', 'based', 'British', 'design', '1829', 'carriages', 'were', 'based', 'American', 'example', '1831', 'never', 'saw', 'such', 'railroad', 'where', 'tracks', 'can', 'be', 'pulled', 'aside', 'get', 'around', 'stubborn', 'burro', 'go', 'up', 'fallen', 'tree', 'stalwart', 'engineer', 'railroad', 'Joe', 'Keaton', 'Buster', 'father', 'departing', 'New', 'York', 'once', 'safely', 'arrived', 'Kentucky', 'young', 'Willie', 'McKay', 'Keaton', 'midst', 'decades-old', 'feud', 'Invited', 'dinner', 'girl', 'befriended', 'train', 'Willie', 'father', 'brothers', 'are', 'Canfields', 'sworn', 'enemies', 'McKays', 'men', 'are', 'determined', 'kill', 'Willie', 'earliest', 'opportunity', 'hospitality', 'will', 'not', 'permit', 'killing', 'guest', 'house.The', 'ensuing', 'chases', 'adventures', 'involve', 'diving', 'deep', 'lake', 'likely', 'Lake', 'Tahoe', 'being', 'swept', 'down', 'swift', 'river', 'Truckee', 'River', 'Lake', 'Tahoe', 'waterfall', 'waterfall', 'constructed', 'set', 'still', '30', 'feet', 'high', 'Keaton', 'strenuous', 'difficult', 'stunts', 'height', 'care', 'thought', 'went', 'film', 'are', 'indicated', 'meticulous', 'costumes', 'sets', 'as', 'well', 'intricate', 'expensive', 'props', 'Keaton', 'had', 'long', 'apprenticeship', 'vaudeville', 'short', 'films', 'appeared', 'audiences', '1923', 'genius', 'had', 'exploded', 'screen', 'fully', 'developed', 'Hospitality', 'next', 'five', 'years', 'sets', 'films', 'got', 'larger', 'stunts', 'more', 'outrageous', 'dangerous', 'Keaton', 'fame', 'soared', 'cost', 'films.Extras', 'Kino', 'edition', 'Hospitality', 'include', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'alternate', '49-minute', 'cut', 'entitled', 'simply', 'Hospitality', 'thought', 'be', 'working', 'copy', 'missing', 'many', 'comic', 'elements', 'were', 'longer', 'version', 'Also', 'included', '19', 'minute', 'film', 'entitled', 'Iron', 'Mule', 'Produced', '1925', 'Keaton', 'mentor', 'Fatty', 'Arbuckle', 'film', 'antique', 'train', 'Hospitality', 'Keaton', 'least', 'one', 'perhaps', 'as', 'many', 'four', 'cameos', 'following', 'paragraph', 'contains', 'observations', 'Keaton', 'attach', 'reviews', 'films', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'graceful', 'mime', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'athletic', 'everyman', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'was', 'Great', 'Stone', 'Face', 'expression', 'never', 'varied', 'acrobat', 'body', 'performed', 'most', 'astounding', 'knockabout', 'comedy', 'genuinely', 'dangerous', 'stunts', 'cinema', 'Other', 'stars', 'had', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'Keaton', 'not', 'only', 'performed', 'own', 'stunts', 'sometimes', 'did', 'stunts', 'other', 'actors', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'advent', 'sound', 'Keaton', 'star', 'faded', 'returned', 'full', 'brilliance', 'death', 'restored', 'versions', 'films', 'have', 'become', 'available', 'home', 'video', 'One', 'Hollywood', 'true', 'originals', 'genius', 'motion', 'picture', 'inventiveness', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'secured', 'place', 'honor', 'history', 'film', 'hearts', 'growing', 'number', 'fans']",N/A

Especially in the cabin scene which is tinted Amber until the lights get turned out, the the tint switches to Blue.The picture is very slightly trimmed at the bottom, the old DVD had a little more picture, so this indicates that it is a new film transfer. But outside of the slight trimming and color tints, this looks like the same transfer as the old DVD.I really was hoping to see more details in the outdoor scenes.  It is not a bad transfer, just not as sharp as I had hoped.  The Blu-ray case clearly states that this is 1080i, not 1080p as is the standard format today.The English Titles & dialogue cards show much more negative damage (scratches & flairs) than the actual movie that this leads me to believe that the bulk of the film came from a cleaner foreign Nitrate negative and the English titles came from a worn U.S. negative.  Just speculation here.The real selling point here is the new bonus material that was not on the old DVD!There is a shorter alternate version of the movie, running just 49 minutes.

273102,A2D63RN5LF14R2,6301931734,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[1, 1]","Our Hospitality (1923) was Buster Keaton`s first true feature film. Keaton's previous ""feature,"" Three Ages (1923) was actually three short films assembled together. There was both an artistic and a commercial reason for this: Three Ages was a parody of the similarly structured D.W. Griffith feature Intolerance (1916). Additionally, Keaton had proved his audience appeal in shorts. Metro Pictures realized the inherent risk of a Keaton feature, and the structure of Three Ages created the option of breaking it down into three shorts. Fortunately for all concerned, Three Ages was a commercial and critical success.Our Hospitality may be seen, in retrospect, as a model for Keaton's features and a precursor to The General (1926). What separates Keaton from his peers (Chaplin, Lloyd, Langdon) is the way his character integrates into a larger narrative. That is not to say that Keaton's films are not character driven, but the character serves the narrative, not vice versa.Our Hospitality opens with a prologue of the ongoing feud between the Canfields and the McKays. A young Canfield and the McKay patriarch are killed in a rainy shoot out at night. To avoid the curse of the feud and further bloodshed, the McKay widow takes her infant son, Willie, and sends him north to New York. Meanwhile, the Canfields swear revenge.Twenty years later, Willie (Keaton) is the personification of a 19th century New York Yankee, adorned in a dandified suit. His mother has since passed away when Willie learns he has inherited his father's estate. Imagining a southern mansion waiting in the wings, Willie hops onto the next train like a salmon returning to its birthplace. Before departing, he is warned by his guardian to stay clear of the Canfields.The trip south foreshadows the archaic world Willie is about to enter. The train itself is primitive and, naturally, encounters numerous mishaps along the way. Luckily for Willie, the ordeal is made bearable because his fellow passenger is a pretty girl (Natalie Talmadge, the first Mrs. Keaton). Unfortunately, Willie's spawning choice here, unknown to him, is a Canfield daughter.There are numerous aquatic metaphors. Willie stands apart from his fellows, like a fish out of water, with city clicker suit and queer umbrella. While fishing, he catches a minnow, throws it back, and then gets pulled into the water by a bigger fish. Willie's mansion turns out to be a dilapidated shack and he unwittingly finds himself in the home of his sworn enemies. True to Southern hospitality, the Canfields vow not kill Willie while he is a guest in their home. When Willie learns of this, he naturally tries to remain a permanent houseguest. Almost forced out, Willie is saved from leaving by the sudden appearance of a heavy downpour. A dam blows up, nearly drowning Willie, but it also safely conceals Willie from his predators, the Canfield boys. In a reversal of the fishing line, Willie is tied, by rope, to a Canfield son. Both get hauled into the water. A descent into the rapids brings further peril, as does a waterfall. Willie dangles over the waterfall like that salmon on a line. Yet, it is the waterfall which unites Willie with his girl, allowing him to spawn.Our Hospitality is replete with inventive sight gags (a tunnel is cut to fit the train, a horse's rear-end is disguised as Willie in drag), but it's really a sophisticated, yet simple retelling of the Romeo and Juliet narrative.* My review was originally published at 366 weird movies.",5,Keaton's First Real  Model Feature,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,3495,"['Hospitality', '1923', 'was', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 's', 'first', 'true', 'feature', 'film', 'Keaton', 'previous', 'feature', 'Three', 'Ages', '1923', 'was', 'actually', 'three', 'short', 'films', 'assembled', 'together', 'was', 'artistic', 'commercial', 'reason', 'Three', 'Ages', 'was', 'parody', 'similarly', 'structured', 'D.W.', 'Griffith', 'feature', 'Intolerance', '1916', 'Additionally', 'Keaton', 'had', 'proved', 'audience', 'appeal', 'shorts', 'Metro', 'Pictures', 'realized', 'inherent', 'risk', 'Keaton', 'feature', 'structure', 'Three', 'Ages', 'created', 'option', 'breaking', 'down', 'three', 'shorts', 'Fortunately', 'concerned', 'Three', 'Ages', 'was', 'commercial', 'critical', 'success.Our', 'Hospitality', 'may', 'be', 'seen', 'retrospect', 'model', 'Keaton', 'features', 'precursor', 'General', '1926', 'What', 'Keaton', 'peers', 'Chaplin', 'Lloyd', 'Langdon', 'way', 'character', 'larger', 'narrative', 'not', 'say', 'Keaton', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'character', 'driven', 'character', 'narrative', 'not', 'vice', 'versa.Our', 'Hospitality', 'prologue', 'ongoing', 'feud', 'Canfields', 'McKays', 'A', 'young', 'Canfield', 'McKay', 'patriarch', 'are', 'killed', 'rainy', 'shoot', 'out', 'night', 'avoid', 'curse', 'feud', 'further', 'bloodshed', 'McKay', 'widow', 'infant', 'son', 'Willie', 'north', 'New', 'York', 'Meanwhile', 'Canfields', 'swear', 'revenge.Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Willie', 'Keaton', 'personification', '19th', 'century', 'New', 'York', 'Yankee', 'adorned', 'dandified', 'suit', 'mother', 'passed', 'away', 'when', 'Willie', 'inherited', 'father', 'estate', 'Imagining', 'southern', 'mansion', 'waiting', 'wings', 'Willie', 'next', 'train', 'salmon', 'returning', 'birthplace', 'departing', 'warned', 'guardian', 'stay', 'clear', 'Canfields.The', 'trip', 'south', 'archaic', 'world', 'Willie', 'enter', 'train', 'primitive', 'naturally', 'encounters', 'numerous', 'mishaps', 'way', 'Luckily', 'Willie', 'ordeal', 'made', 'bearable', 'fellow', 'passenger', 'pretty', 'girl', 'Natalie', 'Talmadge', 'first', 'Mrs.', 'Keaton', 'Unfortunately', 'Willie', 'spawning', 'choice', 'here', 'unknown', 'Canfield', 'are', 'numerous', 'aquatic', 'metaphors', 'Willie', 'apart', 'fellows', 'fish', 'water', 'city', 'clicker', 'suit', 'queer', 'umbrella', 'fishing', 'minnow', 'back', 'then', 'pulled', 'water', 'bigger', 'fish', 'Willie', 'mansion', 'out', 'be', 'dilapidated', 'shack', 'unwittingly', 'home', 'sworn', 'enemies', 'True', 'Southern', 'hospitality', 'Canfields', 'vow', 'not', 'kill', 'Willie', 'guest', 'home', 'When', 'Willie', 'naturally', 'remain', 'permanent', 'houseguest', 'Almost', 'forced', 'out', 'Willie', 'saved', 'leaving', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'heavy', 'downpour', 'dam', 'up', 'nearly', 'drowning', 'Willie', 'also', 'safely', 'conceals', 'Willie', 'predators', 'Canfield', 'boys', 'reversal', 'fishing', 'line', 'Willie', 'tied', 'rope', 'Canfield', 'son', 'get', 'hauled', 'water', 'descent', 'rapids', 'further', 'peril', 'waterfall', 'Willie', 'waterfall', 'salmon', 'line', 'waterfall', 'Willie', 'girl', 'allowing', 'spawn.Our', 'Hospitality', 'replete', 'inventive', 'sight', 'gags', 'tunnel', 'cut', 'fit', 'train', 'horse', 'rear-end', 'disguised', 'Willie', 'drag', 'really', 'sophisticated', 'yet', 'simple', 'retelling', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'narrative', '*', 'My', 'review', 'was', 'originally', 'published', '366', 'weird', 'movies']",N/A
