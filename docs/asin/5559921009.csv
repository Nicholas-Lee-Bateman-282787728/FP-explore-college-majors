While this might seem super dated to some, I loved this aspect of the film.Consistently dubbed a ""nice guy"" by all around him, Dan Burgess is now fed up.  He's fed up with not being able to party or get the girl or even being able to see that he has an impact on those around him, and, of course, he does not want to be known as just a nice guy.  Reaching the end of his rope, Daniel voices a wish out loud...  Enter a creepy angel (watch out for the super creepy smirk) named Muriel (no, guys, this angel is a dude), who informs young Daniel that he has been heard, and he will get to see what his life would be like if he had never been saved.Fast forward a little bit, and Daniel is going through his daily routines and finding himself really surprised about small and huge changes simply because he never accepted Jesus as his Savior and was never changed by God's impact on his life.This is kind of like a different take on It's a Wonderful Life, and the outcome is really interesting.  The film is admittedly dated (as already mentioned), some of the acting is a little subpar (but not bad), and it has its cheesy moments, but I found this movie both intriguing and strangely enjoyable.  It's actually really unique for a Christian film and quite short (it's more like watching a television episode than a movie because of its short length).  Despite the aforementioned negatives, this movie left me in a good mood, and I wanted to watch it again (haven't gotten the chance to but still want to).  I liked how the viewer and the main character both see that Daniel was in fact impacting those around him, and in ways that were sometimes very surprising.  I would prefer to give 4.5 stars but that is just not possible with this site.  I think this is a Christian film that gets overlooked, and I definitely recommend this film.Other Christian films I have watched and enjoyed, for those wanting a recommendation:October Baby: Every Life is BeautifulandUnconditional",4,Corny and dated but oddly enjoyable,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,2094,"['Even', 'Second', 'Glance', 'came', 'out', 'early', '90', 'definite', '80', 'vibe', 'clothing', 'hair', 'might', 'seem', 'super', 'dated', 'loved', 'aspect', 'film.Consistently', 'nice', 'guy', 'Dan', 'Burgess', 'now', 'fed', 'up', 'fed', 'up', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'party', 'get', 'girl', 'even', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'impact', 'course', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'known', 'just', 'nice', 'guy', 'Reaching', 'end', 'rope', 'Daniel', 'wish', 'out', 'loud', 'Enter', 'creepy', 'angel', 'watch', 'out', 'super', 'creepy', 'smirk', 'named', 'Muriel', 'guys', 'angel', 'dude', 'who', 'young', 'Daniel', 'been', 'heard', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'saved.Fast', 'forward', 'little', 'bit', 'Daniel', 'going', 'daily', 'routines', 'finding', 'really', 'surprised', 'small', 'huge', 'changes', 'simply', 'never', 'accepted', 'Jesus', 'Savior', 'was', 'never', 'changed', 'God', 'impact', 'life.This', 'kind', 'different', 'take', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'outcome', 'really', 'interesting', 'film', 'admittedly', 'dated', 'already', 'mentioned', 'acting', 'little', 'subpar', 'not', 'bad', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'found', 'movie', 'intriguing', 'strangely', 'enjoyable', 'actually', 'really', 'unique', 'Christian', 'film', 'quite', 'short', 'more', 'watching', 'television', 'episode', 'movie', 'short', 'length', 'aforementioned', 'negatives', 'movie', 'left', 'good', 'mood', 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'chance', 'still', 'want', 'liked', 'how', 'viewer', 'main', 'character', 'see', 'Daniel', 'was', 'fact', 'impacting', 'ways', 'were', 'sometimes', 'very', 'surprising', 'would', 'prefer', 'give', '4.5', 'stars', 'just', 'not', 'possible', 'site', 'think', 'Christian', 'film', 'overlooked', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film.Other', 'Christian', 'films', 'have', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'wanting', 'recommendation', 'October', 'Baby', 'Life', 'BeautifulandUnconditional']",Second Glance

196105,ARD7ZJIW0OXI4,5559921009,"Hey Man Jesus Saves ""Rocka My Soul In The Bos...","[4, 4]","I like, totally tripped out while watching this, man!  Okay, I've like watched it two and half times now and both times + the point 5 which is 1/2 of the time, I must say... yeah I enjoyed it thoroughly!  I especially enjoy the parts where the guys say ""HEY!  Jesus, man!"" as they pump their fist in a sign of unity and common purpose.  Far out, man!  I'm like, yeah... I can relate to this kind of movie.  Now, some of the acting is a little weird, but isn't everyone more or less a bit unusual?  You know, like those frozen cube people in ""Step-Sister From Planet Weird""... You know what I mean, yeah?  Hey, I think Bull was on steroids or something.  In one scene he is like all amped up and wired... Pretty convincing.  Yeah... ok, like... some oh.. wait a minute.  yeah, that angelic dude with the chick's name ""Muriel""... I'm not sure what I was seeing there.  You know, that guy was a little out there. He sorta looked like perhaps he had wandered off from a nearby Star Trek convention or something.  You know?  He sorta beamed in and out while wearing what looked like a Starfleet issue shirt.  I don't know, man.  I guess I have one minor quibble with a certain aspect of this movie.  Now, ok... what I'm talking about here is not the AGENCY!  SLAP!  Shut up Ernie!  Ok, no.. what I am talking about here is the party... Ok, the kid wants to go to this party that's taking place and all the Christians seem to be of the opinion that by going to this party that you would be subjecting yourself to ""Sin"".  Now, I'm thinking here, man.  That the kid didn't in fact say ""Hey, mom & dad.  I'm heading over to this party to chug down on alcohol, smoke the dope and commit some fornicating and thereby become an elite sinner the likes of which will put Caligula to shame"".  No, he just wanted to go to this party.  Sure, there may be temptations there... But there are temptations everywhere.  And after all didn't Jesus attend parties and turn water into wine.  So I think the premise may have been a little off for this movie but it worked and that's what matters.  I'm thinking the kid could have gone to the party and been a good witness by not imbibing, this more so than coming off as too good to even attend (besides, he may have even achieved a ""contact high"" while there due to the amount of dope that was probably going to be smoked)and no one can fault you for a contact high.  I myself often achieve full contact high just by strolling through my neighborhood on any given morning.  Yeah, he should have gone to the party but then we wouldn't have a movie.Uhhhh... Yeah, man.  I liked it.  You know, the people seemed real and quite potentially possibly not too unlike anyone you may or may not meet during your life... except perhaps for the Star Trek dude that mysteriously popped in all the while portraying a Rod Serling type demeanor.  Note how his jaw functions a lot like Rod Serlings did... minus the smokes.  They could have had this dude toking out during his visitations... perhaps they could have simply qualified this by saying that it was a special cigarette that was in fact used for medicinal purposes and needed to be inhaled while visiting earth in order to counter the effects of cosmic rays or industrial pollution.Ok man, rush right out and get this beauty.  It's a winner!  I thank God for such excellent movies as this ""Second Glance"".  Thanks God!

He wishes he never knew Christ in a pardon of his sins. Thats what he got one day. A taste of the dark side  for a few nights. Then he sees that being in the arms of Christ is much more comforting and safe, than a wicked dark demonic world of sin, mishaps and cold hearted friends. He realizes the difference he was having as a christian and comes back to Jesus! What a refreshing drink of holy goodness! He appreciates even the flaws that his christian life has with the comfort that Jesus will take care of them in his own time. Happy and excited to come back, he begins to make all the right decisions including converting even the non beleiver who he was friends with on the dark side. Stay with Christ!
