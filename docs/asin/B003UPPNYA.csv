And black market videos on eBay were of very poor quality. &#34;Live Voodoo&#34; fills the void - and then some! The greatest songs and the original line-up presented with outstanding sound and visuals. Who could ask for anything more?

They, at one time, had a lead singer who had a distinct voice and a unique ability to deliver irresistibly catchy vocal melodies combined with a very aggressive hard rock/heavy metal style.  The way it was done however, was quite original sounding.However, this particular performance leaves me confused and disappointed.  It doesn't show any of the bands unique talents, and it actually shows Jane's Addiction as a very mediocre and generic alternative rock band, which they most certainly are not.  I can assure you- listen to their early albums, and you'll hear GREAT songwriting.Perhaps Jane's Addiction just aren't a great live band, or maybe they didn't have the energy or dedication to rip out a stellar performance on this particular night, who knows?I'm also not very fond of the way Perry Farrell curses while communicating with the audience.  It doesn't offend me, but I'd rather he not do that.Anyway, just pick up one of the bands early studio albums.",2,no addiction,1307232000,"06 5, 2011",2011,1001,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Jane', 'Addiction', 'one', 'time', 'had', 'lead', 'singer', 'who', 'had', 'distinct', 'voice', 'unique', 'ability', 'deliver', 'irresistibly', 'catchy', 'vocal', 'melodies', 'combined', 'very', 'aggressive', 'hard', 'rock/heavy', 'metal', 'style', 'way', 'was', 'done', 'however', 'was', 'quite', 'original', 'sounding.However', 'particular', 'performance', 'confused', 'disappointed', ""n't"", 'show', 'bands', 'unique', 'talents', 'actually', 'Jane', 'Addiction', 'very', 'mediocre', 'generic', 'alternative', 'rock', 'band', 'most', 'certainly', 'are', 'not', 'can', 'assure', 'you-', 'listen', 'early', 'albums', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'GREAT', 'songwriting.Perhaps', 'Jane', 'Addiction', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'live', 'band', 'maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'energy', 'dedication', 'rip', 'out', 'stellar', 'performance', 'particular', 'night', 'who', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'very', 'fond', 'way', 'Perry', 'Farrell', 'curses', 'communicating', 'audience', ""n't"", 'offend', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'do', 'that.Anyway', 'just', 'pick', 'up', 'one', 'bands', 'early', 'studio', 'albums']",N/A

1366496,A3CEPFGG336O73,B003UPPNYA,DL,"[2, 2]","Plenty to appreciate about this show. For starters, the band forgoes playing its more recent tracks in favor of delivering the tried and true Jane's Addiction classics. Unlike so many other bands whose fame rides on the accomplishments of the distant past, they had no delusions about what the audience wanted to see and hear. The set-list is a gesture of respect and mutual admiration for the core fans who remember the band for being the powerful force of radical change that challenged a music establishment which was begging to be dismantled brick-by-decadent-brick.Dave takes no short-cuts in his delivery of each and every song, belting out a flawlessly executed solo during ""Three Days,"" and seamlessly re-creating the hypnotic intro from ""Ted, Just Admit It"" with studio-quality perfection. He is determined to use his guitar as an instrument of justice, playing every riff with the same conviction that mesmerized audiences decades ago, and which catapulted the band to its legendary status. Rarely contributing a spoken word, he leaves the role of stage presence and off-colored commentary to Perry. He instead communicates through his guitar, masterfully conveying the sonic message of the Jane's Addiction catalog in its full glory.If you were expecting to see Perry's renowned on-stage convulsions, hyperactive interpretive dancing, and psychosis-driven ramblings, then you might be disappointed. As you might've guessed, he's no longer in his twenties and loaded up on whatever is put in front of him. You'd have to imagine that if he hadn't slowed down at some point in his life, he probably wouldn't be around to give these performances. How many of us who witnessed the band in its prime can actually say that we have the same vigor and intensity that we had 20-30 years ago?But, that doesn't mean he isn't his old self. He is provocative bordering on lewd, and who would expect otherwise? Several of the tracks are preceded and followed with his no-nonsense, gritty take on life as he sees it. Whether done intentionally or through his own disregard for common decency, he routinely makes brutally honest references to subjects that might be considered taboo. Scoffing at personal limitations, he summarizes his life-long war on balance and moderation by declaring that ""the highest form of control is having no control at all.""Audio quality is superb. DTS-HD is as it should sound. Moreover, the show was played outdoors, which means the recording has a certain natural openness that is often difficult to achieve with indoor venues. It's an experience comparable to hearing the ""XXX"" album for the first time.Stage lighting is surreal, so it's definitely worth it to see this in blu ray as opposed to dvd. 1080p is really taken advantage of here.As a life-long Jane's fan, I was not the least bit disappointed by this offering from a band whose impact and influence on music is probably immeasurable.",5,All Now With Wings,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,2920,"['Plenty', 'appreciate', 'show', 'starters', 'band', 'playing', 'more', 'recent', 'tracks', 'favor', 'delivering', 'tried', 'true', 'Jane', 'Addiction', 'classics', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'bands', 'fame', 'accomplishments', 'distant', 'past', 'had', 'delusions', 'what', 'audience', 'wanted', 'see', 'hear', 'set-list', 'gesture', 'respect', 'mutual', 'admiration', 'core', 'fans', 'who', 'remember', 'band', 'being', 'powerful', 'force', 'radical', 'change', 'challenged', 'music', 'establishment', 'was', 'begging', 'be', 'dismantled', 'brick-by-decadent-brick.Dave', 'short-cuts', 'delivery', 'song', 'belting', 'out', 'flawlessly', 'executed', 'solo', 'Three', 'Days', 'seamlessly', 're-creating', 'hypnotic', 'intro', 'Ted', 'Just', 'Admit', 'studio-quality', 'perfection', 'determined', 'use', 'guitar', 'instrument', 'justice', 'playing', 'riff', 'same', 'conviction', 'mesmerized', 'audiences', 'decades', 'ago', 'catapulted', 'band', 'legendary', 'status', 'Rarely', 'contributing', 'spoken', 'word', 'role', 'stage', 'presence', 'off-colored', 'commentary', 'Perry', 'instead', 'guitar', 'masterfully', 'conveying', 'sonic', 'message', 'Jane', 'Addiction', 'catalog', 'full', 'glory.If', 'were', 'expecting', 'see', 'Perry', 'renowned', 'on-stage', 'convulsions', 'hyperactive', 'interpretive', 'dancing', 'psychosis-driven', 'ramblings', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'might', ""'ve"", 'guessed', 'longer', 'twenties', 'loaded', 'up', 'put', 'front', ""'d"", 'have', 'imagine', 'had', ""n't"", 'slowed', 'down', 'point', 'life', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'around', 'give', 'performances', 'How', 'many', 'who', 'witnessed', 'band', 'prime', 'can', 'actually', 'say', 'have', 'same', 'vigor', 'intensity', 'had', '20-30', 'years', 'ago', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'old', 'self', 'provocative', 'bordering', 'lewd', 'who', 'would', 'expect', 'otherwise', 'Several', 'tracks', 'are', 'preceded', 'followed', 'no-nonsense', 'gritty', 'take', 'life', 'Whether', 'done', 'intentionally', 'own', 'disregard', 'common', 'decency', 'routinely', 'brutally', 'honest', 'references', 'subjects', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'taboo', 'Scoffing', 'personal', 'limitations', 'life-long', 'war', 'balance', 'moderation', 'declaring', 'highest', 'form', 'control', 'having', 'control', 'Audio', 'quality', 'superb', 'DTS-HD', 'should', 'sound', 'Moreover', 'show', 'was', 'played', 'outdoors', 'recording', 'certain', 'natural', 'openness', 'often', 'difficult', 'achieve', 'indoor', 'venues', 'experience', 'comparable', 'hearing', 'XXX', 'album', 'first', 'time.Stage', 'lighting', 'surreal', 'definitely', 'worth', 'see', 'blu', 'ray', 'opposed', 'dvd', '1080p', 'really', 'taken', 'advantage', 'here.As', 'life-long', 'Jane', 'fan', 'was', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'offering', 'band', 'impact', 'influence', 'music', 'probably', 'immeasurable']",N/A

Eric Avery(Who has since left the band again to be replaced by Duff McKagan) reunited with the band when they got back together in 2008 and they were much better live for it, those of us lucky enough to see the original Jane's line up on tour last year would no doubt agree!So its the Voodoo Experience Festival, New Orleans, Halloween 2009 and the original Jane's line up are about to deliver a brilliant performance which see's them draw from their legendary studio albums 1988's Nothing Shocking and 1990's Ritual de lo Habitual as well as their self titled live debut release(2003's Strays has no material played from it mainly because Eric Avery did not appear on that album).The band open up with instrumental Up The Beach before we hear Avery's familiar bass line as Mountain Song comes crashing out of the speakers. Without doubt some of Jane's best moments are in their longer songs such as 11 minute classic Three Days which has Dave Navarro playing one of the best guitar solo's ever as Perry Farrell dances with 2 scantily clad dancers(one of which is his wife Etty Lau) it's a song that could last 30 minutes and you'd still want to hear it again straight afterwards. On Then She Did Perry asks the crowd to celebrate death, the song still sounds as good as ever with all it's twist and turns, Been Caught Stealing really gets the crowd fired up, and just before the band begin Ocean Size Perry Takes a moment to reflect on the damage that hurricane katrina did to the city of New Orleans. Ted, Just Admit It is one of the highlights of the night as it reaches it's dramatic climax. For the encore Jane's play Jane Says and are joined on stage by loads of people in fancy dress, they then finish the night off with the Drum and Percussion heavy Chip Away.The blu ray/dvd contains a small selection of extras the best being the two bonus tracks(1% and Ocean size) recorded in small clubs in 2008, as well as an NME featurette, the only draw backs about this release is that sometimes Perry's vocals seem a bit buried in the overall mix, but since official live Jane's footage is fairly thin on the ground this release is a must for Jane's fans!",4,THE WAIT IS OVER!,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,2569,"['review', 'Live', 'Voodoo', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', '[', '2010', ']', '[', 'US', 'Import', ']', 'Blu-ray', 'taken', 'long', 'time', 'Jane', 'Addiction', 'finally', 'release', 'official', 'live', 'blu', 'ray/dvd', 'might', 'have', 'preferred', 'something', '1990/91', 'when', 'band', 'were', 'top', 'game', 'least', 'get', 'original', 'line', 'up', 'performing', 'opposed', '97', 'reunion', 'had', 'Flea', 'bass', '2003', 'line', 'had', 'Chris', 'Chaney', 'bass', 'Eric', 'Avery', 'Who', 'left', 'band', 'again', 'be', 'replaced', 'Duff', 'McKagan', 'reunited', 'band', 'when', 'got', 'back', 'together', '2008', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'live', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'original', 'Jane', 'line', 'up', 'tour', 'last', 'year', 'would', 'doubt', 'agree', 'Voodoo', 'Experience', 'Festival', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Halloween', '2009', 'original', 'Jane', 'line', 'up', 'are', 'deliver', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'see', 'draw', 'legendary', 'studio', '1988', 'Nothing', 'Shocking', '1990', 'Ritual', 'de', 'lo', 'Habitual', 'as', 'well', 'self', 'titled', 'live', 'debut', 'release', '2003', 'Strays', 'material', 'played', 'mainly', 'Eric', 'Avery', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'album', '.The', 'band', 'open', 'up', 'instrumental', 'Beach', 'hear', 'Avery', 'familiar', 'bass', 'line', 'Mountain', 'Song', 'crashing', 'speakers', 'doubt', 'Jane', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'longer', 'songs', 'such', '11', 'minute', 'classic', 'Three', 'Days', 'Dave', 'Navarro', 'playing', 'one', 'best', 'guitar', 'solo', 'ever', 'Perry', 'Farrell', '2', 'scantily', 'clad', 'dancers', 'one', 'wife', 'Etty', 'Lau', 'song', 'could', 'last', '30', 'minutes', ""'d"", 'still', 'want', 'hear', 'again', 'straight', 'afterwards', 'Then', 'Did', 'Perry', 'crowd', 'celebrate', 'death', 'song', 'still', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'twist', 'turns', 'Been', 'Caught', 'Stealing', 'really', 'crowd', 'fired', 'up', 'just', 'band', 'begin', 'Ocean', 'Size', 'Perry', 'Takes', 'moment', 'reflect', 'damage', 'hurricane', 'katrina', 'did', 'city', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Ted', 'Just', 'Admit', 'one', 'highlights', 'night', 'dramatic', 'climax', 'encore', 'Jane', 'play', 'Jane', 'Says', 'are', 'joined', 'stage', 'loads', 'people', 'fancy', 'dress', 'then', 'finish', 'night', 'Drum', 'Percussion', 'heavy', 'Chip', 'Away.The', 'blu', 'ray/dvd', 'small', 'selection', 'extras', 'best', 'being', 'two', 'bonus', 'tracks', '1', '%', 'Ocean', 'size', 'recorded', 'small', 'clubs', '2008', 'as', 'well', 'NME', 'featurette', 'only', 'draw', 'backs', 'release', 'sometimes', 'Perry', 'vocals', 'seem', 'bit', 'buried', 'overall', 'mix', 'official', 'live', 'Jane', 'footage', 'fairly', 'thin', 'ground', 'release', 'must', 'Jane', 'fans']",N/A
