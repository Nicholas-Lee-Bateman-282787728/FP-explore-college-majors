(I am not korean) but the acting was superb.  Ms. Kim, deserves multiple awards for her role.what would you do God forbid...Rapist and tool bags that cannot respect a human life, a woman's life like that....

1669709,A1DI3PU62K8KZ0,B00EYNT8F2,Duchess Darcy,"[1, 5]","Based solely on the positive reviews, I watched this. Yes, it is sad and tragic, but the mother acted recklessly. To put it plainly, she was stupid in how she went about getting revenge. Without any backup or plan she went after her daughter's attackers and nearly got herself killed confronting them each time. She was beaten up so many times, I'm surprised she wasn't bleeding internally or had nearly every bone in her ribcage broken.If the same thing happened to my daughter, you bet I would seek revenge but I would have been more prepared. These boys may have been minors, but any of the three were bigger, taller, and physically stronger than her. She was just asking to get herself hurt or better yet killed. I'm all for justice for a wrong doing, but don't go about it in a stupid manner. Obviously the daughter took after her mother when she went to meet with her assailants with a paltry blade. Her mother did marginally better. If she was that willing to kill them, she should have bought a gun.",1,Very Stupid Woman seeks revenge!,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,1007,"['Based', 'solely', 'positive', 'reviews', 'watched', 'Yes', 'sad', 'tragic', 'mother', 'acted', 'recklessly', 'put', 'plainly', 'was', 'stupid', 'how', 'went', 'getting', 'revenge', 'backup', 'plan', 'went', 'daughter', 'attackers', 'nearly', 'got', 'killed', 'confronting', 'time', 'was', 'beaten', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'times', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'bleeding', 'internally', 'had', 'nearly', 'bone', 'ribcage', 'broken.If', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'daughter', 'bet', 'would', 'seek', 'revenge', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'prepared', 'boys', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'minors', 'three', 'were', 'bigger', 'taller', 'physically', 'stronger', 'was', 'just', 'asking', 'get', 'better', 'yet', 'killed', ""'m"", 'justice', 'wrong', 'doing', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'stupid', 'manner', 'Obviously', 'daughter', 'took', 'mother', 'when', 'went', 'meet', 'assailants', 'paltry', 'blade', 'mother', 'did', 'marginally', 'better', 'was', 'willing', 'kill', 'should', 'have', 'bought', 'gun']",N/A

The character building was excellent and I can't recall having seen a sadder, more disturbing movie. The movie also demonstrates that mean people lurk around the outskirts of our personal space and the harm they cause us is not something they care about.",5,Incredible acting and story.

It was a sad depressing movie about the horrible criminal justice system in another country and how minors are let off for atrocious acts include rape.  The stats were posted at the end and it's pretty terrible.  It goes beyond not punishing those below legal age for rape, it has to do with the way that society feels towards women and their role in society.  This movie said a lot.",5,Don't Cry Mommy,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,435,"['gave', 'five', 'stars', 'story', 'acting', 'was', 'sad', 'depressing', 'movie', 'horrible', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'country', 'how', 'minors', 'are', 'let', 'off', 'atrocious', 'acts', 'include', 'rape', 'stats', 'were', 'posted', 'end', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'not', 'punishing', 'legal', 'age', 'rape', 'do', 'way', 'society', 'feels', 'towards', 'women', 'role', 'society', 'movie', 'said', 'lot']",N/A
