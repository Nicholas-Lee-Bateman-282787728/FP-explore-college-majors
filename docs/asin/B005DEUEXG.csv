1455510,A256JK5JGQUTES,B005DEUEXG,Azemiops feae,"[2, 3]","Being born in 1991 and raised on a ranch with no featured/satellite television (only a few local and news channels), I was unable to look into the DB and DBZ series until I was 14. Even then our resources were limited! When it came to DB, I was only able to witness a few episodes. I had friends who gave me the idea of all I had missed. Then there was DBZ which I was able to endure the first 2 seasons of. Going on 2 years ago, I was gifted the opportunity to explore much of what I'd missed from the original DBZ when the newly featured DBZ Kai was released.In some sense I have no right to speak up for or against these series given my lack of knowledge. I was able to watch every episode of DBZ Kai and recover the storyline I was deprived of. After the series, I started putting the two against each other. As much as I enjoy keeping the classics alive in every sense, I must say that I'd enjoyed the DBZ Kai series over the originals.Yes, some detail was removed and a few entire episodes were also. But I'd seen enough of the original to state that although the new version is shorter, it also removed some unnecessary scenes/episodes. I remember the original episodes and I was sitting there watching the ""new"" episode presented by the channel with all my hopes up. In the end, I sat there watching a warrior powering up for the entire episode and took him another 5 episodes just to move a few feet! Just like the Broly movie where the last 30 minutes were spent watching 4 character laying on the ground while the other 2 go six rounds!In the new DBZ Kai series, that never happened. Maybe a few minutes were wasted with this issue. But, it didn't take 200 episodes to make out the storyline's two villains and there demise! So if you find yourself in my situation, I would recommend the DBZ Kai series over the original. I'm not saying in anyway that it is better (given it's just a retake of the original) than the original. I'm simply saying it's just as good regardless of the number of episodes. It tells the same story in a timelier manner. Nothing dramatically essential for total understanding is missing from DBZ Kai!!!",4,Just Had To Accept The Fact,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,2139,"['Being', 'born', '1991', 'raised', 'ranch', 'featured/satellite', 'television', 'only', 'few', 'local', 'news', 'channels', 'was', 'unable', 'look', 'DB', 'DBZ', 'series', 'was', '14', 'Even', 'then', 'resources', 'were', 'limited', 'When', 'came', 'DB', 'was', 'only', 'able', 'witness', 'few', 'episodes', 'had', 'friends', 'who', 'gave', 'idea', 'had', 'missed', 'Then', 'was', 'DBZ', 'was', 'able', 'endure', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'Going', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'gifted', 'opportunity', 'explore', 'much', 'what', ""'d"", 'missed', 'original', 'DBZ', 'when', 'newly', 'featured', 'DBZ', 'Kai', 'was', 'released.In', 'sense', 'have', 'right', 'speak', 'up', 'series', 'given', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'episode', 'DBZ', 'Kai', 'recover', 'storyline', 'was', 'deprived', 'series', 'started', 'putting', 'two', 'other', 'As', 'much', 'enjoy', 'keeping', 'classics', 'alive', 'sense', 'must', 'say', ""'d"", 'enjoyed', 'DBZ', 'Kai', 'series', 'originals.Yes', 'detail', 'was', 'removed', 'few', 'entire', 'episodes', 'were', 'also', ""'d"", 'seen', 'enough', 'original', 'state', 'new', 'version', 'shorter', 'also', 'removed', 'unnecessary', 'scenes/episodes', 'remember', 'original', 'episodes', 'was', 'sitting', 'there', 'watching', 'new', 'episode', 'presented', 'channel', 'hopes', 'up', 'end', 'sat', 'there', 'watching', 'warrior', 'powering', 'up', 'entire', 'episode', 'took', '5', 'episodes', 'just', 'move', 'few', 'feet', 'Just', 'Broly', 'movie', 'where', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'were', 'spent', 'watching', '4', 'character', 'laying', 'ground', 'other', '2', 'go', 'six', 'rounds', 'new', 'DBZ', 'Kai', 'series', 'never', 'happened', 'Maybe', 'few', 'minutes', 'were', 'wasted', 'issue', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', '200', 'episodes', 'make', 'out', 'storyline', 'two', 'villains', 'demise', 'So', 'find', 'situation', 'would', 'recommend', 'DBZ', 'Kai', 'series', 'original', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'anyway', 'better', 'given', 'just', 'retake', 'original', 'original', ""'m"", 'simply', 'saying', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'regardless', 'number', 'episodes', 'same', 'story', 'timelier', 'manner', 'Nothing', 'dramatically', 'essential', 'total', 'understanding', 'missing', 'DBZ', 'Kai']",N/A

1455513,A2G51QSW9WB8I7,B005DEUEXG,Chip,"[8, 9]","Look, I LOVE the original DBZ (and Dragon Ball, though this is primarily about DBZ./DBZ Kai). I watched it all the time on Toonami way back in the day, played with the action figures, played the video games, had some old VHS tapes, and a few years ago I got the orange bricks (not the best remastering, but it overall fit my needs). However, as much as I love the original DBZ (and my DBZ fix was coming up again), I knew I needed a fresh change. As much as I love the Funimation English dub of DBZ, I've got to put some nostalgia aside and admit that it wasn't always the best. The acting was shoddy at times and the scripts (often changed from the original manga) could range from cheesy to downright terrible. Based on everything I had heard/seen from DBZ Kai, it looked exactly like the fix I needed. Not only was it a &#34;new&#34; version of DBZ that would feel fresh, but it would perhaps give me my fix and even more.I am thrilled to say that I was right. [NOTE: This is not the edited version of Kai that aired on Nicktoons. This is the UNCUT version of DBZ Kai that contains blood and swearing.] DBZ Kai is exactly what I wanted and more. First of all, I have the say that the script is WAY better than that of the dub I grew up with. It is manga-accurate and never has those cheesy, cornball moments that the other English dubs have had. Also, considering that they have had 10 years of voice-acting experience, the English actors (mostly the same with a few changes) are absolutely superb this time around. Sean Schemmel completely embodies Goku, as does Chris Sabat as Vegeta and Piccolo (the voices are actually completely distinguishable from each other now). Everyone else is great as well. The main changes I can think of are for Gohan (voiced by Colleen Clinkenbeard) and Bulma (forgot her voice actor's name). These voices have had a largely negative reaction from those like myself who are familiar with the other voices. First of all, with Bulma, while I might prefer Bulma's old voice (it suited her confident, adventurous, sometimes bubbly personality more), I think her new voice works just fine. Her new voice is perfect for the brainy, know-it-all side of the character, as well as her intimidating side (like when she's with Gohan and Krillin on the way to Namek). So I can definitely say I'm happy with her voice. As for Gohan, contrary to public opinion, I LOVE his new voice. While I've always loved Stephanie Naldolny (his old voice actor) as Kid GOKU, I felt like her voice was always too old and too confident sounded for Kid Gohan. This Gohan actually sounds like a 4-5-year-old kid. The whinyness is there when it needs to be, and the rage is perfectly expressed. I can't help but feel people are complaining mainly because it's not the Gohan voice they're used to, despite that it absolutely fits the character.The other BIG draw of Kai is that it (for the most part) completely cuts the filler (or things added to the anime that weren't in the manga). Look, I'm nostalgic for the filler; heck, I even sometimes enjoy watching it. However, Kai cuts all the fluff and tells the story as it is meant to be told, and in my opinion, the whole thing feels more epic that way. Also, the series is much faster paced. There are no more extremely drawn out power-ups or staring contests. It gets straight to the action, and I LOVE that.I'm also a fan of the way the animation has been cleaned up. The colors have also been brightened, and it looks fantastic. The opening and ending credits (different from before) are also really good once you get used to the new songs (Dragon Soul and Yeah!Yeah! Break! Care!, both which I now love). In my opinion, they completely capture the tone of the show, although I can't help but miss Cha-La-Head-Cha-La. Also, Kai contains new eyecatches, or little animations that pop up in the middle of each episode (like an intermission). While the original DBZ had only two eyecatches for the entire series (one for the Saiyan through Cell Sagas and one for the Buu saga), Kai has a different eyecatch depending on what is happening in the episode). This is actually a cool touch and it makes Kai feel like a fresh new show. The only downside to it is that for those new to the show, they might give away details about what's going to happen. But that's just a minor complaint.This brings me to the music. Because of a plagiarism scandal involving Kenji Yamamoto (the original composer for Kai), his music has been replaced on the Blu-Ray releases by that of the original DBZ composer, Shunsuke Kikuchi. Although I grew up with the English dub Bruce Faulconer music (and I still love many of his tracks and have fond memories of hearing them on the show), overall I prefer Kikuchi's music with the show. To me, it's a better fit, plus there are occasionally silent moments that add to the intensity. Unfortunately, there is a bit of a drawback. Much of the music placement is not the same as it was in the original DBZ, and some of the best tracks are not even used. This is something that I have adjusted to considering how much I love everything else about the show, but it is a major drawback to not hear some of Kikuchi's most iconic themes in certain scenes. However, it does contain some good tracks, and since this is, in a way, a &#34;new&#34; version of DBZ, I can live with it.There aren't much bonus features on this set, but I wasn't really asking for them. I'm just happy to see DBZ Kai presented this way. Overall, DBZ Kai is a massive success in my opinion, and it's probably the perfect way for new fans to get into DBZ. Despite the music placement being different, Kai is currently my favorite version of the show. I can't wait to watch Seasons Two-Four (and I'm pumped that they're actually doing the Buu saga now).",5,Better than the Series I Grew Up With,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,5792,"['Look', 'LOVE',

1455517,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B005DEUEXG,Lesley Aeschliman,"[5, 9]","Dragon Ball Z Kai (which is known as Dragon Ball Kai in Japan) is a re-working of the first 194 episodes of Dragon Ball Z that was produced to commemorate the series' twentieth anniversary.  When this series was produced, it was done in a way to remove much of the content in the original series that was not featured in the original manga.  Also, the series also includes a remastered high definition picture, sound, special effects, and a re-recorded voice track with most of the original voice actors.By removing the extra material that had been added to the original anime series, the story in Dragon Ball Z Kai goes at a much more natural pace, and doesn't feel nearly as stretched out as the original series.  The material that is included in the first twenty-six episodes of Dragon Ball Z Kai is covered in the first fifty-four episodes of the original Dragon Ball Z series.The Dragon Ball Z Kai Season One box set includes four DVDs that contain the first twenty-six episodes of the series.  The first and third discs contain seven episodes, while the second and fourth discs contain six episodes and bonus features.  When you see the menus on the discs, it's obvious that all FUNimation did to put this box set together was to combine the Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part One and the Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part Two box sets into one set, since the discs are labeled ""Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part One, Disc One,"" ""Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part One, Disc Two,"" ""Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part Two, Disc One,"" and ""Dragon Ball Z Kai: Part Two, Disc Two.""The extras on disc two contain a textless version of the opening song, a textless version of the closing song, and trailers.  The two textless songs that appear on this disc have the credit text removed, but you can still see the logo, as well as the subtitle text if you watch them with the subtitles on.The extras on disc four contain three versions of the textless opening, the same textless closing that appears on disc two, and trailers.  The first two textless openings are labeled as ""DVD Version 1"" and ""DVD Version 2.""  When I watched both of these textless openings, I really couldn't tell any difference between them; my guess is that there's some kind of really minor change in the video images, where if you blink, you'll probably miss it.  The other textless opening is the ""Broadcast Version,"" which is the version used when the series airs on American television.  Personally, I thought the lyrics for this English version were weaker, and I didn't personally care for the singer.One of my biggest disappointments with this set is the fact that there is no marathon feature.  I really appreciated having this feature when I watched the DVD box sets for the original Dragon Ball series, the ""orange brick"" releases of Dragon Ball Z, and the box sets for Dragon Ball GT; it made it so much easier to watch several episodes in a row in one sitting.  However, as an upside, you get to see the next episode previews at the end of each episode, which you didn't get to see on the releases for the other series.Dragon Ball Z Kai is a decent series, although I'm disappointed that the decision was made in Japan to not include to Majin Boo saga in this project, since that's a story arc that really could have benefited from getting the ""Kai"" treatment.  I would recommend this release to Dragon Ball fans who must own every Dragon Ball DVD release on the market, to viewers who want to be able to watch Dragon Ball Z without the long and drawn-out story arcs, as well as to fans who are familiar with Dragon Ball Z Kai from seeing the series when it aired on American television.I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD box set that I checked out through the King County Library System.",3,Dragon Ball Z Kai is a shortened version of most of the Dragon Ball Z anime series,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,3738,"['Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Kai', 'known', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Kai', 'Japan', 're-working', 'first', '194', 'episodes', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'was', 'produced', 'commemorate', 'series', 'twentieth', 'anniversary', 'When', 'series', 'was', 'produced', 'was', 'done', 'way', 'remove', 'much', 'content', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'featured', 'original', 'manga', 'Also', 'series', 'also', 'remastered', 'high', 'definition', 'picture', 'sound', 'special', 'effects', 're-recorded', 'voice', 'track', 'most', 'original', 'voice', 'actors.By', 'removing', 'extra', 'material', 'had', 'been', 'added', 'original', 'anime', 'series', 'story', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Kai', 'much', 'more', 'natural', 'pace', ""n't"", 'feel', 'nearly', 'as', 'stretched', 'out', 'original', 'series', 'material', 'included', 'first', 'twenty-six', 'episodes', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Kai', 'covered', 'first', 'fifty-four', 'episodes', 'original', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'series.The', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Kai', 'Season', 'One', 'box', 'set', 'four', 'DVDs', 'contain', 'first', 'twenty-six', 'episodes', 'series', 'first', 'third', 'discs', 'contain', 'seven', 'episodes', 'second', 'fourth', 'discs', 'contain', 'six', 'episodes', 'bonus', 'features', 'When', 'see', 'menus', 'discs', 'obvious', 'FUNimation', 'did', 'put', 'box', 'set', 'together', 'was', 'combine', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Kai', 'Part', 'One', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Kai', 'Part', 'Two', 'box', 'sets', 'one', 'set', 'discs', 'are', 'labeled', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Kai', 'Part', 'One', 'Disc', 'One', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Kai', 'Part', 'One', 'Disc', 'Two', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Kai', 'Part', 'Two', 'Disc', 'One', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Kai', 'Part', 'Two', 'Disc', 'Two', 'extras', 'disc', 'two', 'contain', 'textless', 'version', 'opening', 'song', 'textless', 'version', 'closing', 'song', 'trailers', 'two', 'textless', 'songs', 'appear', 'disc', 'have', 'credit', 'text', 'removed', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'logo', 'as', 'well', 'subtitle', 'text', 'watch', 'subtitles', 'on.The', 'extras', 'disc', 'four', 'contain', 'three', 'versions', 'textless', 'opening', 'same', 'textless', 'closing', 'disc', 'two', 'trailers', 'first', 'two', 'textless', 'openings', 'are', 'labeled', 'DVD', 'Version', '1', 'DVD', 'Version', '2', 'When', 'watched', 'textless', 'openings', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'difference', 'guess', 'kind', 'really', 'minor', 'change', 'video', 'images', 'where', 'blink', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'miss', 'other', 'textless', 'opening', 'Broadcast', 'Version', 'version', 'used', 'when', 'series', 'American', 'television', 'Personally', 'thought', 'lyrics', 'English', 'version', 'were', 'weaker', 'did', ""n't"", 'personally', 'care', 'singer.One', 'biggest', 'disappointments', 'set', 'fact', 'marathon', 'feature', 'really', 'appreciated', 'having', 'feature', 'when', 'watched', 'DVD', 'box', 'sets', 'original', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'series', 'orange', 'brick', 'releases', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'box', 'sets', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'GT', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'watch', 'several', 'episodes', 'row', 'one', 'sitting', 'However', 'upside', 'get', 'see', 'next', 'episode', 'previews', 'end', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'releases', 'other', 'series.Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Kai', 'decent', 'series', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'Japan', 'not', 'include', 'Majin', 'Boo', 'saga', 'project', 'story', 'arc', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'getting', 'Kai', 'treatment', 'would', 'recommend', 'release', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'fans', 'who', 'must', 'own', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'DVD', 'release', 'market', 'viewers', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'story', 'arcs', 'as', 'well', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Kai', 'seeing', 'series', 'when', 'aired', 'American', 'television.I', 'wrote', 'review', 'watching', 'copy', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'checked', 'out', 'King', 'County', 'Library', 'System']",N/A

I'have seen all the original dragon ball Z episodes and now i'm watching the KAI version. What I can say is when I was watching the original, I really liked it but it was too long, too much filler and waiting for something to happend. As good as it could be, I had not the will or the energie to watch the whole serie a second time as it was. Furthermore, I wanted to introduce my girlfriend to the dragon ball z world but if like her you are not a die hard fan, the original version is just too much.Now, the kai version is just great. I'm not that far into it but I can say that It make me want to watch Goku and all the Z fighter again. The pace is perfect and I dont miss any of the cut they have made so far. They decided to be closer to the manga, so that version is the closes you can get from the original author vision. That version could be appreciate by a lot of anime fan (who aren't DBZ fan). The only draw back for me is that they have stopped after cell Saga. No blu-ray version goes farther than that.
