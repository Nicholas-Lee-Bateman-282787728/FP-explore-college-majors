However there are several holes in plot development and liberties taken that fictionalize rather than stick with fact. Some of the scenes made cliches of the characters. Events and details surrounding the demise of Curly and Shemp are missing. I thought that Moe being portrayed as a gopher for the studio boss at the beginning was interesting...can anyone confirm this as fact? Joe Besser was left out entirely. I did think that the transition to Joe DeRita was handled well. It did have some good scenes but overall I was not overly impressed. I received a hand written letter from Moe himself in the early 1970's who explained that he was in the process of writing a book about the Stooges which turned out to be pretty good.

I thought it might be cheap or phony, but it was very well done, and it was interesting to learn the ins and outs of the careers and personal lives of the four men (brother Shemp Howard filled in for Curly when he became ill).

1526382,A1J3SZFWI8YV64,B0074JOVTQ,"John Duda ""TV John""","[1, 1]","This is a good movie, not great or fantastic, but good and wholesome, as well as being an informative movie. There are a few Australian Actors in this movie, and I suppose being an Aussie myself I'm probably bias in my review. However the actors who play Moe, Larry and Curly do an excellent job, and I would have to state here that I am a big Michael Chiklis fan, and love everything he has done to date, but having said that Michael Chiklis does an extremely believable and realistic Curly that makes you love him for his effort in portraying the part of Curly, and therefore you end up loving the movie. I first saw this on TV years ago, and have never forgotten it, and when I saw it available on DVD I jumped into action and bought it. One thing I should mention is that this is one of those DVD's on demand types, as the playing side of the disc is coloured purple, but the print side of the disc is made quite well and has a plastic art print on the top of the DVD. Nothing wrong with the entire package, as it is presented well, and most of all works well on any DVD player. Here is what is written on the back cover:- In 1959, a TV executive tries to persuade Moe Howard (Paul Ben-Victor, TV's &#34;In Plain Sight&#34;) to reunite with his former onscreen partners to publicize the television premiere of a package of Three Stooges classic comedy shorts. Howard flashes back on his long and remarkable career with Shemp (John Kassir, TV's &#34;Tales from the Crypt&#34;), Larry (Evan Handler, TV's &#34;Sex and the City&#34;) and &#34;Curly&#34; (Michael Chiklis, TV's &#34;The Shield&#34;). Success proves to be a bumpy road fraught with bad deals, poor health, rocky relationships and group disharmony. The movie is based on the book &#34;Amalgamated Morons to American Icons, The Three Stooges&#34; by Michael Fleming. In this movie you'll see a side to Shemp that I myself haven't seen anywhere else in any other movie, and I'm a pretty huge Three Stooges fan. Anyway I think that if you are a serious fan of The Three Stooges and you don't have this movie in your collection, you'll be happy to view this movie and even view it again later on and perhaps again on other times, if you have the time that is. I've given this movie a 5 star rating because to me it and the packaging has no flaws.",5,An intricate look at The Three Stooges.,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,2307,"['good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'fantastic', 'good', 'wholesome', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'informative', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'Australian', 'Actors', 'movie', 'suppose', 'being', 'Aussie', ""'m"", 'probably', 'bias', 'review', 'However', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'would', 'have', 'state', 'here', 'am', 'big', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'fan', 'love', 'everything', 'done', 'date', 'having', 'said', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'extremely', 'believable', 'realistic', 'Curly', 'love', 'effort', 'portraying', 'part', 'Curly', 'therefore', 'end', 'up', 'loving', 'movie', 'first', 'saw', 'TV', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'when', 'saw', 'available', 'DVD', 'jumped', 'action', 'bought', 'One', 'thing', 'should', 'mention', 'one', 'DVD', 'demand', 'types', 'playing', 'side', 'disc', 'coloured', 'purple', 'print', 'side', 'disc', 'made', 'quite', 'well', 'plastic', 'art', 'print', 'top', 'DVD', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'entire', 'package', 'presented', 'well', 'most', 'works', 'well', 'DVD', 'player', 'Here', 'what', 'written', 'back', 'cover', '1959', 'TV', 'executive', 'tries', 'persuade', 'Moe', 'Howard', 'Paul', 'Ben-Victor', 'TV', '34', 'Plain', 'Sight', '34', 'reunite', 'former', 'onscreen', 'partners', 'publicize', 'television', 'premiere', 'package', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'classic', 'comedy', 'shorts', 'Howard', 'back', 'long', 'remarkable', 'career', 'Shemp', 'John', 'Kassir', 'TV', '34', 'Tales', 'Crypt', '34', 'Larry', 'Evan', 'Handler', 'TV', '34', 'Sex', 'City', '34', '34', 'Curly', '34', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'TV', '34', 'Shield', '34', 'Success', 'proves', 'be', 'bumpy', 'road', 'fraught', 'bad', 'deals', 'poor', 'health', 'rocky', 'relationships', 'group', 'disharmony', 'movie', 'based', 'book', '34', 'Amalgamated', 'Morons', 'American', 'Icons', 'Three', 'Stooges', '34', 'Michael', 'Fleming', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'side', 'Shemp', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anywhere', 'else', 'other', 'movie', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'huge', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'fan', 'Anyway', 'think', 'are', 'serious', 'fan', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'collection', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'view', 'movie', 'even', 'view', 'again', 'later', 'perhaps', 'again', 'other', 'times', 'have', 'time', ""'ve"", 'given', 'movie', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'packaging', 'flaws']",The Three Stooges

We were both Stooges fans as kids and grew up watching their syndicated (and unrewarded) shorts on television in the fifties. Along with Monty Python, Hitchhiker's Guide, and Kurt Vonnegut, the Stooges have been part of my vocabulary and humor for 60 years. Sadly, I knew nothing about the men personally until seeing this film.Obviously, a made-for-television movie will leave out 99% of the facts and details of the lives of men who lived 50-80 years. The reviewers who were upset about omissions from Moe's book are, most likely, regularly disappointed by ""entertainment."" This is not a documentary, although there probably should be one made from the lives of these brilliant and complicated comedians. It's a movie, first, and a biography in distant second. However, the actors vanished into their parts. I am very familiar with Michael Chiklas and Paul Ben-Victor's work and it took me more time than I'd like to admit to identify them. Chiklas was so good that I immediately accepted him as Curly and didn't even bother to try to figure out who he was until late in the movie. Hell, I didn't even know smiling was part of his collection of expressions until I saw The Three Stooges.If you're a fan of Depression Era comedy (the 1930's version, not the 2007 edition), I suspect you'll enjoy the Three Stooges.
