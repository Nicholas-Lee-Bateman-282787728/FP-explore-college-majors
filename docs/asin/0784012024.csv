Your trusty Gray Line tour guide Tim Levitch is waiting to take you into the heart of New York City. This hilarious genius will explain his philosophy of Cruise, riding the wave of Manhattan chaos, forever evading the anti-Cruise, societal controls.You will find out what the collective consciousness of New York is, and see an intimate relationship between a man and his city. His affair with the Brooklyn Bridge and more poignantly, the World Trade Center. September 11th was a devastating post-film anti-climax to this positive spontaneously intellectual perspective.

77026,A3BOGELRQJK8OE,0784012024,a gentle sound,"[2, 2]","Wow. I just am watching this fantastic documentary of a guy that talks of ""the cruise"" and then ""the anti-cruise"" and in his way shows us how he understands his New York, his experiences, his movement through time and space. He says he is sincere, real, in the present. He clearly is creative, over charged with thought on his feelings, constantly in the now in experiences, he's processing his parents, his pain, his joy, his observations to a camera as witness. This is the documentary- his running talking while moving through New York telling, teaching, philosophizing, channeling and meandering cruising it all.  And we sit. And back we go to the tour bus, it's his work where he says he just wanted to pick up girls ""on their time"",  because he is the talking tour bus guide as speaker. I love the part with the description of a New York City nervous breakdown. And one part where in the middle of holding forth on criminal justice and the anti-cruise, on the cockroach that keep moving, he points out the new Anne Taylor store. It captured me entirely on my movie marathon day standing alone as he winds up and through the spaces looking as I so often liked to do up at these monolithic skyforms. He calls this cruising. Dedicated to creation and destruction he says, turmoil and glory. There he lives, he says, in fleeting. He says he is dedicated to, ""I don't know."" I couldn't say it better I don't know how else to sum the film up. It's a beautiful black and white piece.If you want a truly interesting ""cruise"" through New York you need to watch this soliloquy. I've grown a bit neurotic in the watching, processed too much language, exhausted a part of my mind, but it was interesting and completely fascinating to walk with him. I'm thinking this movie really is not for quite a few, and would be loved by the New Yorkers I know, or knew at one time in our lives.A documentary as love story by someone quite extraordinarily spun into his cruise.I would love for him to have what he needs, just to keep on keepin on.",5,Death to the Anti-Cruise,1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,2029,"['Wow', 'just', 'am', 'watching', 'fantastic', 'documentary', 'guy', 'talks', 'cruise', 'then', 'anti-cruise', 'way', 'how', 'New', 'York', 'experiences', 'movement', 'time', 'space', 'sincere', 'real', 'present', 'clearly', 'creative', 'charged', 'thought', 'feelings', 'constantly', 'now', 'experiences', 'processing', 'parents', 'pain', 'joy', 'observations', 'camera', 'witness', 'documentary-', 'running', 'talking', 'moving', 'New', 'York', 'telling', 'teaching', 'philosophizing', 'channeling', 'meandering', 'cruising', 'sit', 'back', 'go', 'tour', 'bus', 'work', 'where', 'just', 'wanted', 'pick', 'up', 'girls', 'time', 'talking', 'tour', 'bus', 'guide', 'speaker', 'love', 'part', 'description', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'one', 'part', 'where', 'middle', 'holding', 'forth', 'criminal', 'justice', 'anti-cruise', 'cockroach', 'moving', 'out', 'new', 'Anne', 'Taylor', 'store', 'captured', 'entirely', 'movie', 'marathon', 'day', 'standing', 'alone', 'up', 'spaces', 'looking', 'so', 'often', 'liked', 'do', 'up', 'monolithic', 'skyforms', 'cruising', 'Dedicated', 'creation', 'destruction', 'turmoil', 'glory', 'fleeting', 'dedicated', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'else', 'sum', 'film', 'up', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'piece.If', 'want', 'truly', 'interesting', 'cruise', 'New', 'York', 'need', 'watch', 'soliloquy', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'bit', 'neurotic', 'watching', 'processed', 'too', 'much', 'language', 'exhausted', 'part', 'mind', 'was', 'interesting', 'completely', 'fascinating', 'walk', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'quite', 'few', 'would', 'be', 'loved', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'know', 'knew', 'one', 'time', 'lives.A', 'documentary', 'love', 'story', 'someone', 'quite', 'extraordinarily', 'spun', 'cruise.I', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'what', 'just', 'keep', 'keepin']",N/A
