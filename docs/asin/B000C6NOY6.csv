955509,A1R7XXHYMKBLE2,B000C6NOY6,"R. J. Marques ""saintricardo""","[9, 10]","Just finished watching this movie and it put me in a very reflective mood.  I actually watched it because I saw that Louise Fletcher was in it, and have always thought that she is an exquisite actress.  She brings a very sublime quality to every role I've ever seen her in that not many actresses can, even if they are small parts.  I also read two reviews wherein the reviewer[s] wondered if this was a 'chick flick' - I didn't view it as that type of movie at all.I would also have to agree with the one negative review I saw here that perhaps the acting chops were not first rate.  The performances by Lisa Brenner and Sherri Saum were perhaps not as stong as they could have been, but they were not that bad either.  The performances by Genevieve Bujold and Louise Fletcher were excellent.Besides, the scenery and the slow unfolding of the story through flashbacks was like the waves from the beach washing over you - it more than made up for less than stellar performances.And the final narration at the end of the film:  ""Life always comes full circle and love is the ultimate forgiveness"" will stay with me for a long time.Give this film a shot - I believe it will stay with you too.",4,A Touchstone...,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,1190,"['Just', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'put', 'very', 'reflective', 'mood', 'actually', 'watched', 'saw', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'was', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'exquisite', 'actress', 'very', 'sublime', 'quality', 'role', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'many', 'actresses', 'can', 'even', 'are', 'small', 'parts', 'also', 'read', 'two', 'reviews', 'wherein', 'reviewer', '[', 's', ']', 'wondered', 'was', ""'chick"", 'flick', 'did', ""n't"", 'view', 'type', 'movie', 'all.I', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'agree', 'one', 'negative', 'review', 'saw', 'here', 'perhaps', 'acting', 'chops', 'were', 'not', 'first', 'rate', 'performances', 'Lisa', 'Brenner', 'Sherri', 'Saum', 'were', 'perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'stong', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'were', 'not', 'bad', 'performances', 'Genevieve', 'Bujold', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'were', 'excellent.Besides', 'scenery', 'slow', 'unfolding', 'story', 'flashbacks', 'was', 'waves', 'beach', 'washing', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'less', 'stellar', 'performances.And', 'final', 'narration', 'end', 'film', 'Life', 'always', 'full', 'circle', 'love', 'ultimate', 'forgiveness', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time.Give', 'film', 'shot', 'believe', 'will', 'stay', 'too']",Finding Home
