So I knew going in that this was probably gonna fail, but it's one of those types that it's so bad it's funny. Now being an Insane Clown Posse fan (lette), I was instantly in love with Pervo the clown not only was his facepaint awesome, but he's obsessed with sex which is hilarious and he only wants to be known as Pervo the clown as he refuses to remove the facepaint remind you of someone? *cough* ICP. The comedy was great! The pooping midget with the stupid faces he makes and the grunting has to be priceless, a straight ten minutes of him swatting in zombie infested woods. Then you have naked or at least topless zombie chicks and again the sex obsessed clown is a win. Especially when he considers having sex with one of the zombies, but then realizes that she will eat him in a not so pleasant way and let's not forget TITTY HAMMERS! LOLIt's the type of movie that my friends and I would probably make just for laughs. I urge any horror/zombie fan to watch this movie knowing that it's low budget and mostly unknown actors going in, but you have to have an off the wall sense of humor in order to truly enjoy this movie.

1396462,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B004CYVZ68,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","&lt;strong>Zombie Women of Satan&lt;/strong> (Steve O'Brien and Warren Speed, 2009)I wanted to like this movie so very, very much. It's got at least a dozen things in it that make me automatically put a movie on my ""oh gawd I must watch this!"" list. I mean, you've got a sociopathic clown who refuses to be in public, even when only amongst friends, without his makeup. A mind-controlled cult of young, beautiful women being used for evil medical experiments who turn into bloodthirsty zombies. A goth-obsessed podcast host who broadcasts from a shack in the middle of the woods and has two hot sisters named Red and Blue, one of whom (Red) is played by hot-hot-hot Marysia Kay (recently in &lt;em>Made in Dagenham&lt;/em>), and whose mother is kept chained in the basement... and no one thinks this is weird, including mum. I could go on. There are all kinds of little tweaks like that that seem like they'd make this the best. damn. zombie. comedy. ever.Needless to say, that didn't happen. In fact, it may be the worst zombedy I've ever seen, and that's saying something.Plot: a traveling circus, headed up by Pervo the Clown (co-director Warren Speed, who when not wearing clown makeup looks kind of like a young Bryan Ferry), and their current touring partner Skye Brannigan (&lt;em>Doghouse&lt;/em>'s Victoria Hopkins), an up-and-coming pop singer, are invited out to the backwoods compound of Tycho Zander (&lt;em>Shackleton&lt;/em>'s Christian Steel) to be guests on his podcast. When they get there, the whole feel of the place is off (and for a traveling troupe headed up by a clown named Pervo, that's saying something). But there's more than that--the cult of mind-controlled beauties being held captive by Tycho's father Henry (&lt;em>The Tournament&lt;/em>'s Bill Fellows) happens to contain Skye's long-missing sister Rachel (&lt;em>Dead Cert&lt;/em>'s Victoria Broom), and Skye catches sight of her, leading to a good amount of grievous bodily harm for everyone involved. Things only get worse when one of the compounds dear old dad has been experimenting with, which turned one of the girls into a bloodthirsty zombie, accidentally finds its way into a bowl of punch that is served to the community at large soon after...So many possibilities. So much tastelessness. And it still manages to not be scary, funny, gory, or in any way entertaining. Speed, who does a credible job as Pervo in front of the camera, also co-wrote and co-directed the film, and in neither case is he anywhere near as good as he is while acting. Because of this, there's a sense of wrongness that will hit the viewer just as much as it does the characters. The timing of every joke in this movie is off. Every single one. Not that some of them would have been funny even with perfect timing, but still, had any bit of this been funny it would have helped loads. The other co-director, Steve O'Brien, is normally a cinematographer, and in that regard, at least, he does decent work; the look of the film is one of the few things that makes it something you might not automatically turn off when you realize what crap it is. But as a director, again, he leaves a great deal to be desired.Had this come from Speed and O'Brien as an original story idea, been developed by someone with an established track record in horror-comedy, and then directed by an experienced director, I think it would have been a solid cult hit. As it is, it's just an unwatchable mess.

1396463,A2LC4CQ9J0A6WS,B004CYVZ68,"The Chief ""The Voice of Reason among hyper-in...","[0, 0]","...Just in case anyone was wondering.  Now that we've got that out of the way, we can look at this flick without any extra pressure; and the only question that matters is where is it on the gold palm of schlock scale?The first thing to establish is that this is not a serious film.  Were it serious, it would probably be unbearable.  Since it's a comedy, it is only barely so, or maybe not, depending on your sense of humor.The second thing to know is that it is British.  This is the sort of British comedy that can trace it's roots back to Benny Hill with perhaps a little of the Goonies thrown in, and also, strangely, reminding me some of Peter Jackson's New Zealanders in Bad Taste.  Stir those influences with Rob Zombie's Devil's Rejects and multiply by FHM and that's something of what this movie is.  I should probably also put something in by which to subtract from the result, because it's just not a very good movie.Veteran viewers of horror films are going to be sharply divided on this one.  Some, like me, who have watched miles of horror film unspool over the years may appreciate the attempt to churn out something a little different, a little bizarre, even if much of it doesn't work.  Others, with just as much experience at judging low-budget horror, are apt to completely dismiss the film because they don't connect in any way to its humor.  Either way, know that when you finally elect to stream this from Netflix, you are really starting to scrape the bottom.An oddball burlesque troupe is invited to appear on an internet TV show, which, unknown to them, is hosted by a cult leader who takes in psychologically damaged pretty young women and uses them as his personal harem.  The host's father is some sort of mad scientist, who occasionally uses one of the girls as a guinea pig for his experiments, one of which results in a zombie infection.  The outbreak spreads throughout the compound, trapping the troupe inside the electrified fences with dozens of half naked zombie women dashing about the woods.Nothing much new there; this film succeeds or fails on the personalities involved, since that is what drives the humor.  I did find myself laughing in a few spots, only to cringe the next at the totally foul and repellant role of the cult leader's mother.  The rest was about as exciting as a twelve-year-old's first perverted fantasies.So, carnage and gore in the tradition of Dead Alive, sexy like a cross between Wendy O. Williams and Susan Boyle, and funny like a train wreck, I can think of no socially redeemable feature to the film.  So I give it 2.5 stars.Trust the chief",2,Zombie Women of Satan is not in line for the Palm d'Or at Cannes...,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,2608,"['Just', 'case', 'anyone', 'was', 'wondering', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'way', 'can', 'look', 'flick', 'extra', 'pressure', 'only', 'question', 'matters', 'where', 'gold', 'palm', 'schlock', 'scale', 'first', 'thing', 'establish', 'not', 'serious', 'film', 'Were', 'serious', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'unbearable', 'comedy', 'only', 'barely', 'so', 'maybe', 'not', 'depending', 'sense', 'humor.The', 'second', 'thing', 'know', 'British', 'sort', 'British', 'comedy', 'can', 'trace', 'roots', 'back', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'perhaps', 'little', 'Goonies', 'thrown', 'also', 'strangely', 'reminding', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'New', 'Zealanders', 'Bad', 'Taste', 'Stir', 'influences', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'multiply', 'FHM', 'something', 'what', 'movie', 'should', 'probably', 'also', 'put', 'something', 'subtract', 'result', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'movie.Veteran', 'viewers', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'sharply', 'divided', 'one', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'miles', 'horror', 'film', 'unspool', 'years', 'may', 'appreciate', 'attempt', 'churn', 'out', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'little', 'bizarre', 'even', 'much', ""n't"", 'work', 'Others', 'just', 'much', 'experience', 'judging', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'are', 'apt', 'completely', 'dismiss', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'connect', 'way', 'humor', 'way', 'know', 'when', 'finally', 'elect', 'stream', 'Netflix', 'are', 'really', 'starting', 'scrape', 'bottom.An', 'oddball', 'burlesque', 'troupe', 'invited', 'appear', 'internet', 'TV', 'show', 'unknown', 'hosted', 'cult', 'leader', 'who', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'pretty', 'young', 'women', 'personal', 'harem', 'host', 'father', 'sort', 'mad', 'scientist', 'who', 'occasionally', 'one', 'girls', 'guinea', 'pig', 'experiments', 'one', 'results', 'zombie', 'infection', 'outbreak', 'compound', 'trapping', 'troupe', 'electrified', 'fences', 'dozens', 'half', 'naked', 'zombie', 'women', 'dashing', 'woods.Nothing', 'much', 'new', 'there', 'film', 'personalities', 'involved', 'humor', 'did', 'find', 'laughing', 'few', 'spots', 'only', 'cringe', 'next', 'totally', 'foul', 'repellant', 'role', 'cult', 'leader', 'mother', 'rest', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'exciting', 'twelve-year-old', 'first', 'perverted', 'fantasies.So', 'carnage', 'gore', 'tradition', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'sexy', 'cross', 'Wendy', 'O.', 'Williams', 'Susan', 'Boyle', 'funny', 'train', 'wreck', 'can', 'think', 'socially', 'redeemable', 'feature', 'film', 'give', '2.5', 'stars.Trust', 'chief']",Zombie Women of Satan

There is also a man who experiments on women by injecting green phosphorescent dye into their stomach, producing a zombie like creature while his wife is chained up.
