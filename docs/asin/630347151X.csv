Mel Gibson and (pre-Hannibal) Anthony Hopkins are excellent as Fletcher Christian and William Bligh. This version adds backstory: Bligh and Christian were friends before their tragic journey that would leave one on trial and one marooned. The story is told via flashbacks by Bligh in front of a court-martial headed by the legendary Lawrence Olivier. This is not your typical production of the Bounty story, this beginning proves it. Next we are shown something of Bligh: he is an aging, ambitious Navy man who wants to advance with this mission: bring bread fruits from Tahiti to the colony in the West Indies, where a famine is occuring. After accomplishing their mission, some sailors, notably Churchill(Liam Neeson, excellent), decide to stay on the island. Punishing them has detrimental effects for Bligh's popularity. Bligh soon is out of control, and it is time for Christian to stage his mutiny. Beautiful photography is just a part of its brilliance. Modern audiences will love this retelling of a classic tale, and it has a stellar cast, high production values, and has that sense of adventure that is essential.

376536,A2SPHTIPK9IKDQ,630347151X,Anony Mous,"[38, 38]","I've seen both the Brando and the Gibson versions, and I feel the latter is far, far superior--as a story that holds together, that has a focal point, and that is entirely believable.The suspense is high on two levels--1. when will Christian and the seamen become so enraged that they will flout Hopkins' order and mutiny, and 2. what will be the final judgement on Hopkins in the trial being conducted on whether or not he was responsible for the mutiny. As the story develops, the suspense keeps intensifying and escalating.I think Hopkins and Gibson played their parts much better than did Howard and Brando. Hopkins expressed many levels of the Bligh character, showing the inner conflict that gripped him--i.e., trying to be fair and human to the seamen and yet needing to exercise stern discipline to enable the ship to accomplish its purpose. His acting was absolutely marvelous, showing how he was being torn apart while at the same time trying to maintain his sanity. However, in the Howard version, all we see is a viciously sadistic personality--one note--without much depth or dimension. Gibson's performance was also excellent as his tension and anger gradually build to a breaking point, but even here he refrained from exerting the violence that he could have. You can't help but sympathize with him.There are many touching moments in the story that make this a most memorable film. I was never bored or uninterested for even a moment--the suspense and drama just kept building and developing as I eagerly wondered how the story would finally end.Well worth buying and seeing more than once.",5,Mesmerizing!,1098230400,"10 20, 2004",2004,1606,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Brando', 'Gibson', 'versions', 'feel', 'latter', 'far', 'far', 'superior', 'story', 'together', 'focal', 'point', 'entirely', 'believable.The', 'suspense', 'high', 'two', 'levels', '1.', 'when', 'will', 'Christian', 'seamen', 'become', 'so', 'enraged', 'will', 'flout', 'Hopkins', 'order', 'mutiny', '2.', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'final', 'judgement', 'Hopkins', 'trial', 'being', 'conducted', 'not', 'was', 'responsible', 'mutiny', 'story', 'suspense', 'keeps', 'intensifying', 'escalating.I', 'think', 'Hopkins', 'Gibson', 'played', 'parts', 'much', 'better', 'did', 'Howard', 'Brando', 'Hopkins', 'expressed', 'many', 'levels', 'Bligh', 'character', 'showing', 'inner', 'conflict', 'gripped', 'i.e.', 'trying', 'be', 'fair', 'human', 'seamen', 'yet', 'needing', 'exercise', 'stern', 'discipline', 'enable', 'ship', 'accomplish', 'purpose', 'acting', 'was', 'absolutely', 'marvelous', 'showing', 'how', 'was', 'being', 'torn', 'apart', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'maintain', 'sanity', 'However', 'Howard', 'version', 'see', 'viciously', 'sadistic', 'personality', 'one', 'note', 'much', 'depth', 'dimension', 'Gibson', 'performance', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'tension', 'anger', 'gradually', 'build', 'breaking', 'point', 'even', 'here', 'refrained', 'exerting', 'violence', 'could', 'have', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'sympathize', 'him.There', 'are', 'many', 'touching', 'moments', 'story', 'make', 'most', 'memorable', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'uninterested', 'even', 'moment', 'suspense', 'drama', 'just', 'kept', 'building', 'developing', 'eagerly', 'wondered', 'how', 'story', 'would', 'finally', 'end.Well', 'worth', 'buying', 'seeing', 'more', 'once']",The Bounty VHS

The very best thing about it is the music by Vangelis.Anthony Hopkins plays Bligh, Mel Gibson plays Fletcher Christian and Sir Laurence Olivier plays Admiral Hood. The movie starts and ends at Bligh's hearing/court marshal/trial to decide whether he was to blame for losing his ship. Admiral Hood presides over the proceedings.You know the story well enough, and this movie seems to stick pretty close to what is known, including a paragraph at the closing about what is not known: what became of Fletcher Christian.Bligh, as you probably know, was not only exonerated but commended for his courage and seamanship in bringing the tiny boat in which he and his loyalists were set adrift when Christian and the rest of the crew seized the Bounty and returned to Tahiti. The story of how they got from Tahiti to Pitcairn Island is included as well.Bligh and his remarkable voyage in what was really no more than a dingy with a sail is also depicted, including how they landed on an island which was so hostile they barely escaped with their lives. It was implied but not explicitly stated that the natives were cannibals.It's a good adventure and lovely photography. But the scenes aboard ship are pretty chaotic, and perhaps we see here a beginning to Mel Gibson's fascination with blood.

376538,A278BQVTXK999P,630347151X,Barry Smith,"[4, 4]","I have always been a fan and a supporter of this underrated classic since the week of its release in 1984.  It opened to mixed critical and public reaction, but I think it deserves a new look.  For one, I think it tells the story of the Mutiny better and more convincingly than the 1935 Laughton/Gable film.  Whereas the original movie mostly had an American cast, an American production, American accents, and a humorous 20th century toungue-in-cheek tone (that renders that ancient movie inaccurate and unwatchable),  THE BOUNTY utilizes an English cast, and takes a more serious tone.  Ultimately, the cast for the Bounty is more believable as British seamen who lived in the 18th century.As far as the storyline is concerned, THE BOUNTY tells its side of the story well.  Bligh as portrayed as an authoritarian leader who has to deal with a crew of insubordinates, led by a lovestruck Christian.  Their stay in Tahiti among the native population changes the mood of the crew.  But Bligh knows what the true mission of his voyage, and tries (but fails) to remind his men that they are really transporters of breadfruit plants from Tahiti to Jamaica.  Ultimately, Bligh's onscreen rages are convincing (whereas the 1935 version portrays Bligh's behavior as the whims of a crazy old man).  The climax of the film, the mutiny itself, is very well done, as the tempers of all involved come to the surface.There is no denying the exquisite look to this film, and it is better served on the big screen. The period dress is impeccable, and it gives the film a historically accurate tone.  What actually happened between Bligh and Christian in 1787 may remain a mystery forever, but I feel that THE BOUNTY is the ultimate and most satisfying statement of the information left for us.",5,I prefer the 1984 version of the Mutiny,1065916800,"10 12, 2003",2003,1778,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'supporter', 'underrated', 'classic', 'week', 'release', '1984', 'opened', 'mixed', 'critical', 'public', 'reaction', 'think', 'new', 'look', 'one', 'think', 'story', 'Mutiny', 'better', 'more', 'convincingly', '1935', 'Laughton/Gable', 'film', 'original', 'movie', 'mostly', 'had', 'American', 'cast', 'American', 'production', 'American', 'accents', 'humorous', '20th', 'century', 'toungue-in-cheek', 'tone', 'ancient', 'movie', 'inaccurate', 'unwatchable', 'THE', 'BOUNTY', 'English', 'cast', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'Ultimately', 'cast', 'Bounty', 'more', 'believable', 'British', 'seamen', 'who', 'lived', '18th', 'century.As', 'far', 'storyline', 'concerned', 'THE', 'BOUNTY', 'side', 'story', 'well', 'Bligh', 'as', 'portrayed', 'authoritarian', 'leader', 'who', 'deal', 'crew', 'insubordinates', 'led', 'lovestruck', 'Christian', 'stay', 'Tahiti', 'native', 'population', 'mood', 'crew', 'Bligh', 'what', 'true', 'mission', 'voyage', 'tries', 'remind', 'men', 'are', 'really', 'transporters', 'breadfruit', 'plants', 'Tahiti', 'Jamaica', 'Ultimately', 'Bligh', 'onscreen', 'rages', 'are', 'convincing', '1935', 'version', 'Bligh', 'behavior', 'whims', 'crazy', 'old', 'man', 'climax', 'film', 'mutiny', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'tempers', 'involved', 'come', 'surface.There', 'denying', 'exquisite', 'look', 'film', 'better', 'served', 'big', 'screen', 'period', 'dress', 'impeccable', 'film', 'historically', 'accurate', 'tone', 'What', 'actually', 'happened', 'Bligh', 'Christian', '1787', 'may', 'remain', 'mystery', 'forever', 'feel', 'THE', 'BOUNTY', 'ultimate', 'most', 'satisfying', 'statement', 'information', 'left']",The Bounty VHS

376540,A1BWHXTFOVF9CY,630347151X,Blackhawk,"[5, 5]","The movie is excellent, but that is all you get on the DVD.  The only extra is a grainy theatrical trailer.  There is an abundance of supplemental material that could have been included.  I've seen several documentaries about the Bounty mutiny and Pitcairn Island that would have made great extras for the DVD.  In particular is a New Zealand made documentary, ""A Fated Ship,"" that shows the construction of the replica Bounty that was used in this movie.  It is a fascinating story.  The replica was built for a set of two movies that were to be directed by David Lean (""Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"") and produced by Dino de Laurentis.  Lean dropped out of the project and De Laurentis was stuck with a full-sized, completely accurate replica of the Bounty.  This documentary is far superior to the short, publicity fluff pieces that pass for ""documentaries"" on too many DVDs. But nothing like that is provided.There is so much history associated with story of the Bounty that the potential for special features is vast.  I would really like something like ""A Fated Ship"" or the Australian documentary about HMS Pandora, the frigate sent to retrieve the mutineers.  But even a commentary track or a ""behind-the-scenes"" featurette would have been better than nothing.It seems doubtful, but perhaps ""The Bounty"" will get a decent DVD release someday with a suitable suite of extras.",5,Excellent Movie Given a Bare-Bones DVD Release,1085011200,"05 20, 2004",2004,1403,"['movie', 'excellent', 'get', 'DVD', 'only', 'extra', 'grainy', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'abundance', 'supplemental', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'documentaries', 'Bounty', 'mutiny', 'Pitcairn', 'Island', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'extras', 'DVD', 'particular', 'New', 'Zealand', 'made', 'documentary', 'Fated', 'Ship', 'construction', 'replica', 'Bounty', 'was', 'used', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'story', 'replica', 'was', 'built', 'set', 'two', 'movies', 'were', 'be', 'directed', 'David', 'Lean', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'produced', 'Dino', 'de', 'Laurentis', 'Lean', 'dropped', 'project', 'De', 'Laurentis', 'was', 'stuck', 'full-sized', 'completely', 'accurate', 'replica', 'Bounty', 'documentary', 'far', 'superior', 'short', 'publicity', 'fluff', 'pieces', 'pass', 'documentaries', 'too', 'many', 'DVDs', 'nothing', 'provided.There', 'so', 'much', 'history', 'associated', 'story', 'Bounty', 'potential', 'special', 'features', 'vast', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'something', 'A', 'Fated', 'Ship', 'Australian', 'documentary', 'HMS', 'Pandora', 'frigate', 'sent', 'retrieve', 'mutineers', 'even', 'commentary', 'track', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'nothing.It', 'doubtful', 'perhaps', 'Bounty', 'will', 'get', 'decent', 'DVD', 'release', 'someday', 'suitable', 'suite', 'extras']",The Bounty VHS
376541,A2Z28WKY1LHBKY,630347151X,"blockhed ""blockhed""","[2, 3]","In the end factual truth is always more interesting than fictionalized story-telling. This is a much, much better account of the fascinating tale of the Bounty than the crude over-simplifications of the Gable/Laughton and Brando/Howard versions, although both of those are highly watchable movies in their own right. The perennial question about this episode in Britain's naval history is why did this mutiny actually happen? There is no clear or obvious answer: after all, hundreds of British ships ruled the waves for many decades without mutinies, many of them under far more gruelling and cruel conditions than the Bounty. This film surely comes closest to truly understanding the unique factors that led to the fateful insurrection, and it seems to boil down to a strange and unfortunate mixture of human personalities and very unusual physical circumstances. Bligh's major disastrous error appears to have been his desire to round the Horn, which led to a domino effect of mounting problems in achieving the original purpose of the voyage. The film doesn't make it properly clear that the ship was actually delayed for 5 whole months on Tahiti, in order to fit in with the seasonal vagaries of the breadfruit plants.Some other peculiar flaws in the screenplay have been picked up by another reviewer. There seems to have been no truth at all in the idea that Bligh again wanted to sail round the Horn on his return voyage; and there seems no purpose in introducing the scene of Bligh lying to the King of Tahiti about the death of Captain Cook --- although the record may show that he did do this. What the film does make very clear is that Bligh was certainly never a cruel tyrant, and also that he was exonerated for having allowed the mutiny to happen. He seems to have been a man of sensitivity, courage and intelligence, who wanted to manage his men according to good principles. However, he lacked the human touch and charisma to inspire loyalty. His genuine abilities came to the fore in his astounding open-boat voyage of nearly 7,000 km, more remarkable even than the mutiny that caused it. Fletcher Christian was basically a weak character, who allowed himself to be manipulated by malcontents. The hysterical scenes of the actual mutiny are extremely well portrayed in the film. The actors all perform excellently, and it is good to see Gibson in a restrained, well-judged role, before his downward spiral, from Braveheart onwards, into one ghastly, untruthful movie after another.",5,By far the best version,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,2498,"['end', 'factual', 'truth', 'always', 'more', 'interesting', 'fictionalized', 'story-telling', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'account', 'fascinating', 'tale', 'Bounty', 'crude', 'over-simplifications', 'Gable/Laughton', 'Brando/Howard', 'versions', 'are', 'highly', 'watchable', 'movies', 'own', 'right', 'perennial', 'question', 'episode', 'Britain', 'naval', 'history', 'why', 'did', 'mutiny', 'actually', 'happen', 'clear', 'obvious', 'answer', 'hundreds', 'British', 'ships', 'ruled', 'waves', 'many', 'decades', 'mutinies', 'many', 'far', 'more', 'gruelling', 'cruel', 'conditions', 'Bounty', 'film', 'surely', 'closest', 'truly', 'understanding', 'unique', 'factors', 'led', 'fateful', 'insurrection', 'boil', 'down', 'strange', 'unfortunate', 'mixture', 'human', 'personalities', 'very', 'unusual', 'physical', 'circumstances', 'Bligh', 'major', 'disastrous', 'error', 'have', 'been', 'desire', 'round', 'Horn', 'led', 'domino', 'effect', 'mounting', 'problems', 'achieving', 'original', 'purpose', 'voyage', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'properly', 'clear', 'ship', 'was', 'actually', 'delayed', '5', 'whole', 'months', 'Tahiti', 'order', 'fit', 'seasonal', 'vagaries', 'breadfruit', 'other', 'peculiar', 'flaws', 'screenplay', 'have', 'been', 'picked', 'up', 'reviewer', 'have', 'been', 'truth', 'idea', 'Bligh', 'again', 'wanted', 'sail', 'round', 'Horn', 'return', 'voyage', 'purpose', 'introducing', 'scene', 'Bligh', 'lying', 'King', 'Tahiti', 'death', 'Captain', 'Cook', 'record', 'may', 'show', 'did', 'do', 'What', 'film', 'make', 'very', 'clear', 'Bligh', 'was', 'certainly', 'never', 'cruel', 'tyrant', 'also', 'was', 'exonerated', 'having', 'allowed', 'mutiny', 'happen', 'have', 'been', 'man', 'sensitivity', 'courage', 'intelligence', 'who', 'wanted', 'manage', 'men', 'according', 'good', 'principles', 'However', 'lacked', 'human', 'touch', 'charisma', 'inspire', 'loyalty', 'genuine', 'abilities', 'came', 'fore', 'astounding', 'open-boat', 'voyage', 'nearly', '7,000', 'km', 'more', 'remarkable', 'even', 'mutiny', 'caused', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'was', 'basically', 'weak', 'character', 'who', 'allowed', 'be', 'manipulated', 'malcontents', 'hysterical', 'scenes', 'actual', 'mutiny', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'portrayed', 'film', 'actors', 'perform', 'excellently', 'good', 'see', 'Gibson', 'restrained', 'well-judged', 'role', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Braveheart', 'onwards', 'one', 'ghastly', 'untruthful', 'movie']",The Bounty VHS

Who wouldn't feel that way after being ordered to leave a tropical South Seas island paradise and the devastatingly beautiful Mauatua (Tevaite Vernette, the most beautiful women ever to appear on film) by a cruel and overbearing Captain Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) to be stuck onboard a ship in excruciating heat with a motley group of sweaty, unwashed sailors. A rather easy choice to make, military service or life on the beach. I think I would want to be back on that island too.Technically and artistically a first class production, yet it still only earns 4 out of 5 stars. I found the pace of the film to be rather slow, particularily in the onboard ship sequences.

The battle of wills between Captain Bligh (excellent Anthony Hopkins) and Fletcher Christian (equally excellent Mel Gibson). What prompted me to write a review is another review, one from Mr. Stefan Schott from Germany (December 29, 2000), who gave the DVD one star! He said that the dialogues were so distorted that it is impossible to watch the movie and that image quality is below average.First, maybe the quality of the copy in Europe (Region 2) is different from the one that sells for Region 1.I bought the DVD yesterday and watched it last night. This is a prime example of low price/high quality DVD. The widescreen is a perfect media to set off the visual quality of that movie.  The sunsets are marvelous, the close-ups are stunning and the scenes filmed at the water's edge leave us breathless. As for the audio quality, I did not find any flaws.  The sound is perfectly clear and the dialogues are all audible.Obviously, Mr. Schott had a much different experience than I did with the DVD version of &quot;The Bounty&quot;.  I just wanted to bring that to the attention of potential American buyers so that they will not be put off by Mr. Schott's review.The only let down of this DVD is that there are no extras.

Since the 1981 Ocasr winning film Chariots Of Fire, the audience in the United States did not see a remarkable film from the United Kingdom Of Great Britian for some time. When The Bounty hit the big screen in 1984, the long wait had ended. And this film would go down in history as the best and most accurate adaptation of the historical mutiny.Filmed on location in New Zealand, Polynesia, London, and at Pinewood Studios in England, Roger Donaldson definately put the material he had been given to very good use. Robert Bolt, who wrote the screenplay also did his research well. With such leading actors as Mel Gibson, Sir Anthony Hopkins, the late Sir Lawrence Olivier, Daniel Day Lewis, Liam Neeson, and countless others...this film was a box office winner. The cinema-photography was very sharp and beautiful, and the native women in the film, just as beautiful, native, scintillating, and sexy. Even the nudity of the women was in good taste.Hopkins delivers an Oscar winning perfomance as Captain William Bligh, as does Mel Gibson in his role as First mate Fletcher Christian. Both actors from Wales and Austrailia portray the characters as human beings with very human faults. There is no villian or hero in this version. It boils down to faults on both sides. Both Bligh and Christian. Liam Neeson gives an excellent portrayal of Charles Churchill, a very scrappy seaman with an explosive force of nature. And Daniel Day Lewis gives a very hateful and sneaky performance as the ill fated John Friar. A character who gets the fate that he deserves in the end.From an historical point of view, the film was right on the mark. That also includes the sets, costume designs, and other factual parts of the film. Most of all Vangelis's musical score for the film is just as beautiful as his score was for Chariots Of Fire and Blade Runner.If you enjoy history, fine acting from the ebst in the United Kingdom, and other certain aspects, I would recommend this version of the mutiny on the bounty.

376551,AEUITP7BZ1PTV,630347151X,cplaywrite,"[1, 1]","The Bounty is a well told tale with a strong cast - including four future Oscar winners no less - Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs), Gibson (Producing and Directing ""Braveheart""), Liam Neeson (Schindler's List), and two-timer Daniel Day-Lewis (My Left Foot and There Will Be Blood).  Don't forget to include veteran actor, and already an Oscar winner, Sir Laurence (Hamlet) into the mix.  I compare this version easily with Brando's version, as that one had great actors like Trevor Howard and Richard Harris.  Both Gibson and Brando showed a side of Fletcher that was confused between romance and duty.  These are certainly two factors that led to his decision to mutiny. Gibson was a great actor in his younger days, and this movie showed that the New York born Aussie could hold his own after making ""alternative"" cult classics like Mad Max.  Hopkins portrayal of Bligh exceeds that of Richard Harris.  Hopkins shows a side of empathy, while remaining by the book, and seemingly ruthless - hard to do.Now, that being said - lets not forget the original screen version of 1935.  This starred Clark Gable (Oscar Winner-1934) and Charles Laughton (Oscar Winner - 1933) as Fletcher and Bligh respectively.  The cast also includes Franchot Tone' in the cast.  It remains the only film to have garnered three Best Actor Nominations - for the same film - in the same year.

376552,AUHG8KSHI529U,630347151X,Craig Matteson,"[3, 4]","This isn't a simple retelling of the story of the ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" with a vicious Captain Bligh and a troubled, but virtuous Mr. Christian saving the crew from unbearable cruelty.  This is a much better story.The movie begins at the trial at the Admiralty of Lieutenant Bligh for losing the HMS Bounty.  The movie flashes back to the story from this trial periodically.  This device allows the movie to focus on key points in a story that takes place over well more than a year without having to try and keep a strict narrative together.Bligh has been assigned to go to Tahiti to get Breadfruit plants and take them to Jamaica to provide cheaper feed for the slaves and while he is doing that he wants to circumnavigate the globe - a career-making move in 1787.  Assigned to Bligh as first mate is John Fryer who is doubtful about going round the Horn off the southern tip of South America that is noted for its mighty storms.  Bligh brings along his friend Fletcher Christian as the officer after John Fryer.After they finally reach Tahiti and negotiate to get the breadfruit, they have to wait for them to grow.  They are there many months longer than expected and the men get attached to the local women who are mostly bare breasted and very agreeable companions.  Discipline breaks down.Bligh remains above all the fraternization, but has a hard time pulling the crew back together and as they set sail for home he applies harsh discipline to get the crew back into fit condition and sets a course that upsets the men.  Christian has his own resentments and torn loyalties, but does lead the crew in mutiny and sets Bligh adrift in a small open launch (it was only 23 foot long and 6 foot 9 inches wide).  Bligh's courage and magnificent seamanship got them through the 3,618 nautical mile journey without loss of life in 47 days.  The movie isn't quite accurate about the survival of all the crew.Christian goes back to Tahiti but is forbidden to stay.  The mutineers and some Tahitians end up on a then unknown island and their descendants live there to this day.This movie was made in 1984 as a vehicle for Mel Gibson's charisma and blazing stardom.  He is charismatic and has some good lines and does them well.  His Christian is torn, but also self indulgent and sometimes petulant without much discipline.  The star of this movie, and becomes more so each time I see it, is Anthony Hopkins playing Captain Bligh.  He is wonderful in this role.  His characterization is quite complex.  His Bligh is a good man without charisma who tries to hold order with a discipline that becomes harsher as the men resist.  In this movie there isn't a single villain with good guys, it is a confluence of flaws in all the characters that leads to the breakdown.My favorite portion of the movie is in the open launch.  I find those scenes particularly powerful.My least favorite aspect of the movie is the musical score by Vangelis.  He was a hot commodity in the early 1980's having done ""Chariots of Fire"" and ""Blade Runner"" (his most effective score).  Here it gives a strange quality to a movie taking place in the 18th century.  This is especially so since there are large portions of the movie without background music and when the synthesizers come in they are too noticeable.  For me, and maybe not for you, but for me, it makes the movie sound too much like ""Blade Runner"".  It is a small point, however.

376553,A1YIYS3J7EQ3F8,630347151X,"C. Santas ""Constantine/film buff""","[0, 1]","The Bounty (1984)Directed: Roger DonaldsonCast: William Bligh: Anthony Hopkins. Fletcher Christian: Mel Gibson. Mr. Fryer: Daniel Day-Lewis. Lawrence Olivier. Edward Fox. Liam Neeson. Bernard Hill.The third major remake of the Mutiny on the Bounty incident is not based on the novels by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, but on history, drawing materials from Roger Hugh's book, ""Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian,"" 1972, which differed from the two fictional epics of 1935 and 1962 versions. Thus, the 1984 ""The Bounty"" presented the two principal characters in an entirely different light. To begin with, Bligh and Christian knew each other before they sailed together, and Bligh actually promoted Christian to his first mate over Fryer, who had held this position, soon after the bounty sailed. Bligh, as played by Hopkins, appears insecure, mild-mannered, the image of a true English ""gentleman,"" a captain who cares for his crew, and one who relies on Christian to keep disgruntled and brawling crew members in line. The film begins with his appearance before the Admiralty, where he is giving the account of the mutiny, a trial in which he had to defend himself. The rest of the story is told in flashbacks, as occasionally the action is broken to return to the questioning board. A voice-over commentary is used, but only sparingly, to help the flow of the narrative.During the first part of the trip, the purpose of which is the same as in the fictional accounts, to procure roots of the breadfruit in Tahiti to transport to Jamaica as food of the slave population, Bligh behaves perfectly with both crew and his fellow officers, and none of the cruel floggings and other atrocities seen in the previous movies occur. The ship fails to negotiate Cape Horn, and has to change route and go around African Cape of Good Hope, thence to Australia and eventually to reach Tahiti, after a considerable delay.The trouble begins in Tahiti. As Bligh tells the court, his crew, deprived of their domestic comforts for so long, succumb easily to the seductive environment of the tropical island, the climate, easy life, little labor, and the scores of bare-breasted women that welcome them. Bligh attributes Christian's change to his loss of moral fiber, and thus his authority and dignity of an officer of the Royal Navy. Inevitably, discipline is slackened, and when the return trip begins, the men are appalled by Bligh's persistence to go again around Cape Horn in his return route, gaining fame as one who has circumnavigated the globe. Friction develops, and a wild brawl breaks out, a brawl not initiated by Christian, who almost reluctantly takes the leading role, mostly to avoid slaughter on board the ship. Captain Bligh, with his loyal crew are lowered into the long boat, with barely enough provisions to reach a neighboring island. The movie never shows the Pandora (in actuality helmed by Captain Edwards, not Bligh) returning to Tahiti. It only shows Bligh's unbelievably arduous sea adventure, reaching Timor in the Dutch East Indies, while Christian, a few women, including his loyal girlfriend, sail for an unknown destination, under the threat of a new mutiny, until they discover Pitcairn Island, mapped wrongly, where the take refuge. The final scenes show the Bounty Burning, while the few exiles stay there forever. The trial ends with Bligh's dismissal of any guilt and heavy praise for his gallant return,The Bounty offers good acting all around, excellent photography of exotic lands, and good action scenes, including a spectacular storm sequence. What it lacks, in comparison to its two predecessors, is dramatic tension between the two main characters--Bligh and Christian. Hopkins is too benign a character to evoke hatred, lacking Trevor Howard's sang-froid and Laughton's malice. He is too likable, too gentlemanly. Gibson looks more like a frightened--and tame--youth, too prone to be obsequious, too lovelorn to be brave. He lacks Gable's bravura masculinity, and Brando's mastery of withheld rage. Moreover, in the most dramatic scene in the story--the mutiny itself--what is shown is a chaotic melee which lacks the aura of inevitability of a clash between a villain and hero, in the other moves trumpeted from the moment these character set foot on the Bounty. Thus, the audience is held at a distance, uninvolved emotionally, despite some heartbreaking scenes--one of which is Christian's girl, slashing her head in sorrow when her lover departs.

376555,AECVYXIL9791R,630347151X,David C. Read,"[6, 6]","This is the third major cinematic retelling of the story of the Bounty.  The standard is still the 1935 version with Charles Laughton and Clark Gable, of course, but this most recent version has the advantage of color, and plenty of beautiful, topless Tahitian women.Speaking of which, this retelling places the major responsibility for the mutiny on the beautiful, topless Tahitian women.  Hopkins portrays Captain Bligh as hard-nosed, but not cruel, and his disciplinary actions are depicted as well within the bounds of what was acceptable in those days.  No keel hauling, no letting people die of thirst, no banishing people to the rigging during storms, etc.  The problem is that Fletcher Christian has fallen in love with a Tahitian princess, who becomes pregnant with his child, and he is heartbroken about leaving her.  Bligh is totally insensitive to his friend's predicament, and chooses that moment to start running a tight ship.  Even so, Christian is conflicted about the mutiny.  He seems to know he is doing the wrong thing, but can't help himself.This may be a more balanced (and perhaps more historically accurate, I don't know) portrayal of the story, but it leaves you with no one to root for and no one to identify with.  You feel bad for both men.  You feel sorry for Christian, because it must have been gut-wrenching for him to have to leave his young Tahitian wife, but you can't really approve of the mutiny, either.  On the other hand, you do not like Bligh, who is an insensitive, arrogant prick, but he has done nothing that even comes close to justifying taking the ship away from him.On a technical note, the picture looks great, and the sound is unusually good for DVD.  On the negative side, there are no extras whatsoever.  I am chagrined to learn, from a previous reviewer, that there were two commentary tracks on the British version.  The DVD is being sold inexpensively in America, but I bet most buyers would have gladly paid a little more to get the version with the commentary tracks and some decent extras.",4,Underrated retelling of the Bounty story,1026086400,"07 8, 2002",2002,2047,"['third', 'major', 'cinematic', 'retelling', 'story', 'Bounty', 'standard', 'still', '1935', 'version', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'course', 'most', 'recent', 'version', 'advantage', 'color', 'plenty', 'beautiful', 'topless', 'Tahitian', 'women.Speaking', 'retelling', 'major', 'responsibility', 'mutiny', 'beautiful', 'topless', 'Tahitian', 'women', 'Hopkins', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'hard-nosed', 'not', 'cruel', 'disciplinary', 'actions', 'are', 'depicted', 'well', 'bounds', 'what', 'was', 'acceptable', 'days', 'keel', 'hauling', 'letting', 'people', 'die', 'thirst', 'banishing', 'people', 'rigging', 'storms', 'etc', 'problem', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'fallen', 'love', 'Tahitian', 'princess', 'who', 'pregnant', 'child', 'heartbroken', 'leaving', 'Bligh', 'totally', 'insensitive', 'friend', 'predicament', 'moment', 'start', 'running', 'tight', 'ship', 'Even', 'so', 'Christian', 'conflicted', 'mutiny', 'know', 'doing', 'wrong', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'himself.This', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'balanced', 'perhaps', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'portrayal', 'story', 'one', 'root', 'one', 'identify', 'feel', 'bad', 'men', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Christian', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'gut-wrenching', 'have', 'leave', 'young', 'Tahitian', 'wife', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'approve', 'mutiny', 'either', 'other', 'hand', 'do', 'not', 'Bligh', 'who', 'insensitive', 'arrogant', 'prick', 'done', 'nothing', 'even', 'close', 'justifying', 'taking', 'ship', 'away', 'him.On', 'technical', 'note', 'picture', 'great', 'sound', 'unusually', 'good', 'DVD', 'negative', 'side', 'are', 'extras', 'whatsoever', 'am', 'chagrined', 'learn', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'were', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'British', 'version', 'DVD', 'being', 'sold', 'inexpensively', 'America', 'bet', 'most', 'buyers', 'would', 'have', 'gladly', 'paid', 'little', 'more', 'get', 'version', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'decent', 'extras']",The Bounty VHS

Accordingly, THE BOUNTY is a magnificent film, not only because of the acting, but also due to magnificent visuals depicting tropical beauty to harsh brutality on the open sea.Hopkins is a sensational actor; his portrayal of Captain Bligh--a gruff, by-the-book officer bent on accomplishing his mission and voyage--is compelling and memorable.  He doesn't come across as a cold-blooded, raving, maniacal sadist, but as a hard man who exercises bad judgment, yet shows he, too, has feet of clay.  In fact, Hopkins's Bligh demonstrates considerable humanity for his men who are adrift with him on the Bounty's launch boat following the mutiny--a launch that will miraculously navigate thousands of miles on the open ocean.And Gibson puts his own spin on young Fletcher Christian, the most famous mutineer in all of literature.  Gibson brings the torment the ship's mate is experiencing to the forefront, but often does it in Gibsonesque, over-the-top style.  Neeson, Day-Lewis, and Olivier are all solid in their supporting roles.  At two-plus hours, THE BOUNTY only drags (some) when the ship arrives in Tahiti, and the film goes into an inexplicable precipitous lull.

Mel Gibson is terrific as Fletcher Christian, and Anthony Hopkins (as Captain Bligh) conducts himself precisely as I would imagine a 19th century British Navy captain going about his business.  The movie also stars a young Daniel Day Lewis and Liam Neeson - before either was a really big-name star.  None other than Sir Laurence Olivier portrays the admiral who sits in judgment of captain Bligh.I saw a documentary on the HMS BOUNTY that was shown on the History channel.  This movie is pretty darned accurate in its depiction of what actually happened.  There was not a whole lot that was Hollywoodized in it, which is rare for an historical movie these days.The trek of some 2,000 miles over the ocean in an open boat that Bligh & his men had to undertake remains to this day one of the most brilliant feats in maritime history.  Without charts or navigation instruments, Bligh got the boat to safe harbor using nothing more than the stars for direction.  Some may believe that this part of the film was fabricated - it was not.  The journey really WAS that perilous.I do have one note for parents:  the PG Rating is a bit mis-leading.  There are gorgeous Tahiti women who frolick around topless once they reach the island.  Needless to say, I don't object to this, but parents may want to take caution.  I realize the makers of the film believed it to be nudity in a NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC sort of way, but these women are gorgeous!If you're a fan of navy history and want to find out what really happened aboard the HMS BOUNTY, this movie belongs in your DVD collection.

But it does have its faults. For starters, Gibson really doesn't get a chance to shine in this movie, Anthony Hopkins more or less has the larger role and handles it well, but even he seems subdued at times. There was considerable more interaction between Gable and Laughton in the original. The person I had the most sympathy for was Greek composer Vangelis. I've been a fan of this guy's music even before ""Chariots of Fire"", but here, he too seems restrained. Much of the score fits nicely with the visuals, nearly etheral and dream-like at times, but occasionally you get the feeling he really wanted to cut loose with something a little more sweeping and dramatic, ala ""Blade Runner"", but it would have been out of context with the core of the movie.Even after all these years, Tevaite Vernette is still a sight to behold. It's a shame this Tahitian-born beauty was a one-hit wonder, only doing this single film before returing to a normal life.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[5, 7]","Dang, don't you just HATE it when your crew turns on you?That's the problem that Captain Bligh faces in this gritty, realistic story of the mutiny on the Bounty. Mel Gibson plays Anthony Hopkins' first mate, who  rebels and brings a lot of his buddies with him when they reach Tahiti, but  are charmed by the native girls, climate, and the simple beauty of it all.  Unfortunately, when Bligh refuses to budge or sway, the men mutiny.A  warning: This story is not for the kiddies. It may be PG, but there is a  great deal of casual toplessness amongst the native gals, an  all-naughty-parts-hidden swim, and a fall-over visual of Gibson and his  pregnant girlfriend. Aside from the sexiness of it, there is also a  disturbing section where some former deserters are whipped.That said,  Hopkins does a fantastic job creating a man who you want to slap for being  so rigid, and sympathize with because of the pain in his eyes while he is  being grilled. Gibson, usually more emotive, seems a bit uncomfortable and  stiff. My personal fave, Liam Neeson, plays a rebellious jerk who remains  behind on the island, and Neesonites will cringe in pain at the look on his  face as he is whipped.So watch the movie, but be ready to cover small  eyes.",4,Gritty and sometimes too realistic,964051200,"07 20, 2000",2000,1240,"['Dang', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'HATE', 'when', 'crew', 'problem', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'story', 'mutiny', 'Bounty', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'first', 'mate', 'who', 'lot', 'buddies', 'when', 'reach', 'Tahiti', 'are', 'charmed', 'native', 'girls', 'climate', 'simple', 'beauty', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'Bligh', 'budge', 'sway', 'men', 'mutiny.A', 'warning', 'story', 'not', 'kiddies', 'may', 'be', 'PG', 'great', 'deal', 'casual', 'toplessness', 'native', 'gals', 'all-naughty-parts-hidden', 'swim', 'fall-over', 'visual', 'Gibson', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'Aside', 'sexiness', 'also', 'disturbing', 'section', 'where', 'former', 'deserters', 'are', 'said', 'Hopkins', 'fantastic', 'job', 'creating', 'man', 'who', 'want', 'slap', 'being', 'so', 'rigid', 'sympathize', 'pain', 'eyes', 'being', 'grilled', 'Gibson', 'usually', 'more', 'emotive', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'stiff', 'personal', 'fave', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'rebellious', 'jerk', 'who', 'island', 'Neesonites', 'will', 'cringe', 'pain', 'look', 'face', 'whipped.So', 'movie', 'be', 'ready', 'cover', 'small', 'eyes']",The Bounty VHS

Countless times retold and in as many ways, The Bounty is the ultimate portrayal of life aboard the Armed Vessel Bounty.  An all-star cast, including Anthony Hopkins, Mel Gibson, Liam Neeson and Sir Lawrence Olivier navigate this film through it's stormy storyline of loyalty lost and mutiny found.Mel Gibson brings a career-best performance as British Naval Officer Fletcher Christian, who has agreed to sail to Tahiti aboard The Bounty under the command of Lt. William Bligh (Hopkins).  Their friendship comes undone as Bligh becomes increasingly intolerant of his crew's behavior while at port in Tahiti.  Christian leads a mutiny and sets Bligh adrift.  In spite of starvation, thirst and bad sunburn, Bligh demonstates his naval supremacy by sailing his dinghy to a French port, thereby saving himself and the few men who would not mutiny.  Christian eventually contends with a near-mutinous crew of his own before finding Pitcairns Island, his final port-of-call before his uncertain demise.Let me just say that the cinematography of this movie is magical.  The scenes at sea and in Tahiti are absolutely beautiful.  Hopkins plays convincingly as an over-achieving, demanding ship's Captain.  And, contrary to a couple of reviewers, I absolutely loved the musical score by Vangelis.  It provided a hauntingly mesmerising theme to the adventure and danger of crossing vast seas in the 1700's.Well worth watching, this film, 20+years old, is still one of the best naval-themed movies ever.  I found it more exciting than Master and Commander.  And, the fact it's based on a true story makes it even more irresistable.  4+stars.",4,"Arrgh!

376568,A1UYL5GIQ8YE77,630347151X,Fred L. Houpt,"[0, 0]","I finally got round to watching this film and I really enjoyed it. I brought two mirrors to bear in my mind as I watched. One was the film &#34;Master and Commander&#34;, which is not a mutiny story but depicts the era and life on the oceans. The other is a masterpiece of investigative historical research. The book is &#34;The Bounty: the true story of the mutiny on the Bounty&#34; by Caroline Alexander. Examining this story from a wealth of rarely seen documents in Australia and New Zealand (if I recall) she was able to piece together many disjointed parts of the mutiny. Further she provided much background information about what became of Bligh and those involved in the mutiny. I cannot recommend her book enough for those who have a taste for this crazy story.First of all the film is gorgeous to look at. The scenery fairly drips with colours. The bare chested natives are also nice eye-candy. The uniforms of commissioned officers just about pop out of the screen with such bright shades. I quite enjoyed the manner in which the trial that Bligh, like all commanders or captains who had lost their ship had to endure, was juxtaposed back and forth into the story. (Now that I think about it, this would be a good time to plug all of the Aubrey/Maturin novels of the beloved Patrick O'Brian. From him you will learn as much if not more about naval life than by reading Alexander's terrific book).A few weaknesses in retrospect come to mind. Sir Joseph Banks was the man who put the entire breadfruit, Tahiti expedition in motion. That it was an adventure to find a way of growing food cheaply and efficiently to feed slaves on Jamaica makes the blood run hot. That they continued back to Tahiti once again to pursue the fruit was surely one of the lowest points in English history. I am surprised that Banks was not inserted more clearly as the initiator of this madness. I would normally say that Mel Gibson gives a strong performance in whatever role he inhabits, given that he is a very talented actor. Notwithstanding a loathing of him as a person outside of the movie industry, I didn't let my revulsion influence watching him act. I found his embodiment of Fletcher Christian a bit wobbly. I say this because instead of emoting something more clearly defined as turmoil when it was appropriate, too often, for my liking, he wore a blank look on his face. Compare this to the master actor, Sir Anthony Hopkins, who is famous for allowing the character he represents to be transparent and fully involved.Over all I think that it is under rated and if trashed by critics of that time, unjustly so. I saw a comment here from someone who said &#34;forget Master and Commander&#34;. Not so. It also is a superb film and adheres very closely to the several O'Brian novels from which the script is crafted. Finally, I am not really a big fan of Vangelis. I mean, the only film that I associate his soundtrack music to is the always entertaining &#34;Blade Runner&#34;. I can't imagine that film without the music. Seen these many years later, the 1984 film of the Bounty does not couple well with the electronic sounds that Vangelis was known for. A minor quibble but I'm a musician and am fussy about soundtracks. By comparison there is not one single sound of music that is out of place in &#34;Master and Commander&#34;.

376570,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,630347151X,Godly Gadfly,"[18, 23]","Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins star as Master's Mate Fletcher Christian and Captain Lt. William Bligh in this story of the ill-fated Bounty in 1787.  The mutiny of the Bounty is of course a historically documented fact and oft-told tale.  Here the story is told with extended flash-backs from Bligh's perspective, with his court martial being the framework of the movie.  Bligh's failure to successfully round Cape Horn not only frustrated his ambitions to circumnavigate the globe, but also incensed his crew to rebellion.  He becomes increasingly isolated from Christian and the rest of his crew, and when a lengthy stay at the island paradise of Tahiti is over, he finds himself with a mutiny on his hands.  Hopkins' performance as Bligh is outstanding and sympathetic.  He shows how Bligh's devotion to his ambition verges on madness, and his tears at the climax when he is exonerated become all the more powerful in view of the careful control of his emotions throughout the movie.  The movie features a good soundtrack from Vangelis with much that seems to be ripped off from his stunning ""1492 Conquest of Paradise"" score, and although it doesn't quite match the brilliance of that project it does enhance the suspense and action beautifully.The movie gained a PG rating due to several scenes of violence (such as a fight amongst the crew, the mutiny itself, a vicious flogging, and an attack by savages), frightening scenes (the ship during the storm) and half a dozen instances of blasphemy.  There is also a great deal of sexual content: an over-abundance of half-naked bare-breasted Tahiti natives, several incidents of crude sexual talk, and obviously implied sexual orgies between the male crew and the Tahiti women.While the sexual content is a major distraction, it is also major theme of the movie.  ""What made them so easy to corrupt?"" a question articulated by one of the characters, is the dominant question that drives the plot, and is actually the question for which Bligh is being tried.  Bligh's exoneration shows that the cause doesn't lie in him.  But the suggested answer ""the place itself"" is not entirely accurate, although it unquestionably was a catalyst for the corruption of the crew.  The island of Tahiti becomes like the ancient Island of Lesbos, where men are unable to escape the clutches of beautiful women.  Tahiti has the lure of a sinful Paradise, and becomes a symbol of pure and unlimited hedonism: food, wine, women and song.  The local girls give freely, and the men can give their primitive instincts free reign, by abandoning all sense of duty and responsibility, and following human passions in a grand display of infidelity and lust.  Fletcher Christian leads the way with his seduction of the island king's young daughter.  Captain Bligh is the exception who resists temptation and remains faithful to his duty, but in the process is presented as weak and foolish.  But as the journey to Tahiti shows, actually the seeds of dissent, corruption and ruin were already present in the hearts of the men before they even arrived at the island paradise.Although the hedonism is initially painted as a Paradise and presented rather positively, in the final analysis viewers must come to a different conclusion about the collapse of discipline, confirmed by Bligh's exoneration and the harsh facts of the consequences of unbridled corruption.  Ultimately it is not just Bligh, but the sensuous passions of mankind that are on trial.  When people are set free from the apparent bondage of law and authority (represented by Bligh), eventually sin self-destructs and leads to its own ruin.  The mutineers must live with the consequences of their actions, and conclude their days in loneliness on Pitcairn Island, never to see England again.  This of course, is the true story of the Bounty which everyone already knows.  But this isolation becomes almost a metaphor for hell: giving free reign to their passions on the Tahiti paradise has ultimately proven to lead not to heaven but a hellish isolation.  Ultimately it is the depravity of the human heart that has led to this ruin.  Although ""The Bounty"" doesn't show the answer to this ruin in the gospel, this true story shows the folly of depraved human passions and demonstrates that the Paradise which these passions seek is an illusion, and eventually leads to ruin.  Certainly this is a message worth learning, but I doubt that such a vivid and unedifying picture of depravity is necessary in order to learn it.",3,Quote: &#65533;What made them so easy to corrupt?&#65533;,1042588800,"01 15, 2003",2003,4507,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'star', 'Master', 'Mate', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'Captain', 'Lt.', 'William', 'Bligh', 'story', 'ill-fated', 'Bounty', '1787', 'mutiny', 'Bounty', 'course', 'historically', 'documented', 'fact', 'oft-told', 'tale', 'Here', 'story', 'told', 'extended', 'flash-backs', 'Bligh', 'perspective', 'court', 'martial', 'being', 'framework', 'movie', 'Bligh', 'failure', 'successfully', 'round', 'Cape', 'Horn', 'not', 'only', 'frustrated', 'ambitions', 'circumnavigate', 'globe', 'also', 'incensed', 'crew', 'rebellion', 'increasingly', 'isolated', 'Christian', 'rest', 'crew', 'when', 'lengthy', 'stay', 'island', 'paradise', 'Tahiti', 'over', 'mutiny', 'hands', 'Hopkins', 'performance', 'Bligh', 'outstanding', 'sympathetic', 'how', 'Bligh', 'devotion', 'ambition', 'verges', 'madness', 'tears', 'climax', 'when', 'exonerated', 'more', 'powerful', 'view', 'careful', 'control', 'emotions', 'movie', 'movie', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'Vangelis', 'much', 'be', 'ripped', 'off', 'stunning', '1492', 'Conquest', 'Paradise', 'score', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'brilliance', 'project', 'enhance', 'suspense', 'action', 'beautifully.The', 'movie', 'gained', 'PG', 'rating', 'due', 'several', 'scenes', 'violence', 'such', 'fight', 'crew', 'mutiny', 'vicious', 'flogging', 'attack', 'savages', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'ship', 'storm', 'dozen', 'instances', 'blasphemy', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'sexual', 'content', 'over-abundance', 'half-naked', 'bare-breasted', 'Tahiti', 'natives', 'several', 'incidents', 'crude', 'sexual', 'talk', 'obviously', 'implied', 'sexual', 'orgies', 'male', 'crew', 'Tahiti', 'sexual', 'content', 'major', 'distraction', 'also', 'major', 'theme', 'movie', 'What', 'made', 'so', 'easy', 'corrupt', 'question', 'articulated', 'one', 'characters', 'dominant', 'question', 'plot', 'actually', 'question', 'Bligh', 'being', 'tried', 'Bligh', 'exoneration', 'cause', ""n't"", 'lie', 'suggested', 'answer', 'place', 'not', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'unquestionably', 'was', 'catalyst', 'corruption', 'crew', 'island', 'Tahiti', 'becomes', 'ancient', 'Island', 'Lesbos', 'where', 'men', 'are', 'unable', 'escape', 'clutches', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Tahiti', 'lure', 'sinful', 'Paradise', 'symbol', 'pure', 'unlimited', 'hedonism', 'food', 'wine', 'women', 'song', 'local', 'girls', 'give', 'freely', 'men', 'can', 'give', 'primitive', 'instincts', 'free', 'reign', 'abandoning', 'sense', 'duty', 'responsibility', 'following', 'human', 'passions', 'grand', 'display', 'infidelity', 'lust', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'way', 'seduction', 'island', 'king', 'young', 'daughter', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'exception', 'who', 'temptation', 'faithful', 'duty', 'process', 'presented', 'weak', 'foolish', 'journey', 'Tahiti', 'shows', 'actually', 'seeds', 'dissent', 'corruption', 'ruin', 'were', 'already', 'present', 'hearts', 'men', 'even', 'arrived', 'island', 'hedonism', 'initially', 'painted', 'Paradise', 'presented', 'rather', 'positively', 'final', 'analysis', 'viewers', 'must', 'come', 'different', 'conclusion', 'collapse', 'discipline', 'confirmed', 'Bligh', 'exoneration', 'harsh', 'facts', 'consequences', 'unbridled', 'corruption', 'Ultimately', 'not', 'just', 'Bligh', 'sensuous', 'passions', 'mankind', 'are', 'trial', 'When', 'people', 'are', 'set', 'free', 'apparent', 'bondage', 'law', 'authority', 'represented', 'Bligh', 'eventually', 'sin', 'self-destructs', 'own', 'ruin', 'mutineers', 'must', 'live', 'consequences', 'actions', 'conclude', 'days', 'loneliness', 'Pitcairn', 'Island', 'never', 'see', 'England', 'again', 'course', 'true', 'story', 'Bounty', 'everyone', 'already', 'isolation', 'almost', 'metaphor', 'hell', 'giving', 'free', 'reign', 'passions', 'Tahiti', 'paradise', 'ultimately', 'proven', 'lead', 'not', 'heaven', 'hellish', 'isolation', 'Ultimately', 'depravity', 'human', 'heart', 'led', 'ruin', 'Bounty', ""n't"", 'show', 'answer', 'ruin', 'gospel', 'true', 'story', 'folly', 'depraved', 'human', 'passions', 'Paradise', 'passions', 'seek', 'illusion', 'eventually', 'ruin', 'Certainly', 'message', 'worth', 'learning', 'doubt', 'vivid', 'unedifying', 'picture', 'depravity', 'necessary', 'order', 'learn']",The Bounty VHS
376571,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,630347151X,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[3, 13]","This was a disappointing film.  Granted, it's a tad more historically accurate depiction of the Bounty then the other two films made of the story, but it still didn't get at the heart of it.  In this film, Captain Bligh is portrayed as more human, but that's really just in the beginning of the voyage.  After they leave Tahiti, he becomes deranged and obsessed.  No real explanation is given, and it seems the makers of the film resorted to the time worn ""good guy/bad guy"" stuff because it was easy and doesn't require much thought.  The actual story of the mutiny is quite complex.  Bligh was not at all mad, but actually quite benign, especially compared to the dastardly Captain Cook, who was as cruel as his reputation suggests, and to other sea captains of his time.  Bligh was considerably considerate towards his crew, doubling their rest periods, supervising their diet (to prevent scurvvy), and ensuring they had proper exercise (there is a scene in this film depicting that).  He was also a master seaman, managing one of the most extraordinary feats in navigational history, sailing 3618 miles in an open boat for 41 days.  This is depicted in the film, but it's really not given any real significance, probably because it would show Bligh in a positive light.  It is not really known exactly why there was a mutiny.  The most proper explanation is that Fletcher Christian fell in love with Tahiti (and a woman), and that Bligh was furious at the loss of discipline of his crew.  Originally, this film was supposed to be two films, both of epic length, directed by the great David Lean.  Robert Bolt wrote the scripts, and by all accounts, Bolt's original scripts were masterful.  But due to production delays, cost overruns, bad weather, etc., etc., Lean was never able to make the two films he envisioned.  He tried to get one film made, but that wasn't to be either.  Eventually Lean dropped out of the project, throwing his energy into his final film, A Passage to India.  The massive Bolt script was whittled down into a shorter version, and that's what was used for the film here.  The film feels like a greatest hits version of the Bounty, without any real nuance or deep character development.  The director here, Roger Donaldson, is no David Lean, and it shows.  His direction is very workmanlike, and ends up being stale and he doesn't give this film the epic sweep it so desperately needs.  The film also glosses over the fate of the mutineers.  In this film, it's implied that the mutineers lived in peace and harmony once they landed on Piticarin Island, but in fact, many of which died at the hands of the natives and the others were caught by English ships set out to find the mutineers, and they were all executed.  I would suggest reading books on this subject, rather than seeing the films, as none of them reach the complexities of the real story.",2,Another disappointment telling of the Bounty saga....,1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,2879,"['was', 'disappointing', 'film', 'Granted', 'tad', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'Bounty', 'then', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'made', 'story', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'heart', 'film', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'portrayed', 'more', 'human', 'really', 'just', 'beginning', 'voyage', 'leave', 'Tahiti', 'deranged', 'obsessed', 'real', 'explanation', 'given', 'makers', 'film', 'resorted', 'time', 'worn', 'good', 'guy/bad', 'guy', 'stuff', 'was', 'easy', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'thought', 'actual', 'story', 'mutiny', 'quite', 'complex', 'Bligh', 'was', 'not', 'mad', 'actually', 'quite', 'benign', 'especially', 'compared', 'dastardly', 'Captain', 'Cook', 'who', 'was', 'as', 'cruel', 'reputation', 'other', 'sea', 'captains', 'time', 'Bligh', 'was', 'considerably', 'considerate', 'towards', 'crew', 'doubling', 'rest', 'periods', 'supervising', 'diet', 'prevent', 'scurvvy', 'ensuring', 'had', 'proper', 'exercise', 'scene', 'film', 'depicting', 'was', 'also', 'master', 'seaman', 'managing', 'one', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'feats', 'navigational', 'history', 'sailing', '3618', 'miles', 'open', 'boat', '41', 'days', 'depicted', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'given', 'real', 'significance', 'probably', 'would', 'show', 'Bligh', 'positive', 'light', 'not', 'really', 'known', 'exactly', 'why', 'was', 'mutiny', 'most', 'proper', 'explanation', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'fell', 'love', 'Tahiti', 'woman', 'Bligh', 'was', 'furious', 'loss', 'discipline', 'crew', 'Originally', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'two', 'films', 'epic', 'length', 'directed', 'great', 'David', 'Lean', 'Robert', 'Bolt', 'wrote', 'scripts', 'accounts', 'Bolt', 'original', 'scripts', 'were', 'masterful', 'due', 'production', 'delays', 'cost', 'overruns', 'bad', 'weather', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'Lean', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'make', 'two', 'films', 'envisioned', 'tried', 'get', 'one', 'film', 'made', 'was', ""n't"", 'be', 'either', 'Eventually', 'Lean', 'dropped', 'project', 'throwing', 'energy', 'final', 'film', 'Passage', 'India', 'massive', 'Bolt', 'script', 'was', 'whittled', 'down', 'shorter', 'version', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'film', 'here', 'film', 'feels', 'greatest', 'hits', 'version', 'Bounty', 'real', 'nuance', 'deep', 'character', 'development', 'director', 'here', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'David', 'Lean', 'direction', 'very', 'workmanlike', 'up', 'being', 'stale', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'epic', 'sweep', 'so', 'desperately', 'film', 'also', 'fate', 'mutineers', 'film', 'implied', 'mutineers', 'lived', 'peace', 'harmony', 'once', 'landed', 'Piticarin', 'Island', 'fact', 'many', 'died', 'hands', 'natives', 'others', 'were', 'caught', 'English', 'ships', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'mutineers', 'were', 'executed', 'would', 'suggest', 'reading', 'books', 'subject', 'rather', 'seeing', 'films', 'none', 'reach', 'complexities', 'real', 'story']",The Bounty VHS

376575,A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,630347151X,J. Chambers,"[3, 3]","""The Bounty"" is a 1984 British movie that starred Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins. It is the fifth film version of the story of the mutiny on the Bounty. The screenplay was based on the book ""Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian"" (1972) by Richard Hough. In this film, Mel Gibson played Fletcher Christian opposite Anthony Hopkins as William Bligh (for the record, Bligh was a lieutenant, not a captain, when he commanded the Bounty) in a lavish remake. This final version, which gives a far more sympathetic view of William Bligh, is considered by some historians to be the closest to actual historical events.In addition to Gibson and Hopkins, the cast included Lawrence Olivier, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Liam Neeson. There's hardly a slowdown in the action in this superb remake of the famous Bounty story.Over the years, most writers and filmmakers have demonized Bligh as a ruthless, cruel master, and Fletcher Christian as a heroic figure, but the truth may be somewhat different. I've been fascinated by the mutiny on the Bounty story since I read Nordhoff and Hall's book in high school. Over the years, a lot of research has been done to put together a more accurate story of what happened on the Bounty. One of the best books that I've read about this is Caroline Alexander's 2003 book, ""The Bounty: The True Story of the Mutiny on the Bounty.""I give ""The Bounty"" five stars for pure entertainment.

Thre's good action, good drama, good scenery to go along with good acting and casting.  Mel Gibson was still a relative newcomer on the movie scene when this film was made.  He had achieved some recognition from the ""Mad Max"" films but in this role he played a real life character, Fletcher Christian.  Anthony Hopkins brought the experience to the cast that brought out the solid performances from those who made up the ""Bounty's"" crew.Straight-laced William Bligh commanded the ""Bounty"" on what was to be a circumnavigation of the globe to obtain breadfruit trees for Jamaica.  Storms at Cape Horn forced the ship to divert to the south Pacific via the Indian Ocean.  He alienated many of the crew with his discipline and insistence on order.  Eventually the ship lands at Tahiti amid ceremony and native pageantry.  The crew quickly begins to fraternize with native women which leads to further breakdowns in discipline.Fletcher Christian, as Bligh's right hand man, emerges as the leader of those who seek to take control of the ship.  This is perhaps the film's defining scene as Christian refuses to harm Bligh, but stands his ground when challenged by Bligh.  Once in control of a mutinous crew, Christian has his hands full in finding safe haven away from the shipping lanes.  He retains order, but many are presumably ready to mutiny again if land isn't discovered soon.  As fate would have it, Bligh and those cast off in the life boat with him, find land and return to England.  Bligh is put on trial where he is exonerated of any wrongdoing.This movie gives a good account of the mutiny on the Bounty.  With nothing but Bligh's log book as record it is difficult to recreate the events without some bias, but this film seems balanced in its approach.  The mutineers eventually discover Pitcairn Island where their descendents live to this day.  The film is well made with solid directing and acting.

I can remember anticipating seeing THE BOUNTY on cable in the mid-80's, having (like most) missed it in theaters. When I finally did, I pretty much became obsessed with it, watching it repeatedly, memorizing whole scenes, and becoming increasingly mesmerized by Vangelis' throbbing,over-heated score(a double c.d. soundtrack I'm proud to say I own since only 2000 were produced). The 80's won't be remembered for many cinematic gems, but THE BOUNTY ought to be mentioned as being one of the few. It's a classy, serious drama(not a melodrama like the other versions), and it really deserves to be re-examined. As does Hopkins performance which is nothing less than brilliant.

Others have expounded on the plot, acting etc.  I'll just say that it's one of those movies that's great, but for some reason never achieves the recognition it deserves.  There's very little action, so those looking forMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World [Blu-ray]- type battles may be disappointed; it's mostly interpersonal drama.  Be aware that a significant portion of it features the women of Tahiti wearing nothing but loincloths; this sets the stage for the funniest scene in the movie, which involves Anthony Hopkins, but I won't spoil it by giving it away.  Parents may want to use caution, as the native girls perform a welcome dance for the British sailors, and it becomes very suggestive.  There is also a death scene that, while not the bloodiest I've seen on film, was certainly brutal.  No matter what you may think after viewing it, in real life Bligh was the hero of this story.  Vangelis' exquisite score really added to the sense of mystery, danger, loss, and beauty.  Speaking of beauty, the location scouts did an excellent job.  I'd really like to see this film undergo a full restoration, so that the scenery could be viewed in all its glory.

It also seems to think that it's necessary to show nudity to draw and audience.  While probably accurate, it seems gratuitous and out of place in the story of the stuggle between Bligh and Christian.  Furthermore, this story's tendentious attitude towards Captain Bligh makes Christian look like he mutinied just to sleep with the topless girls on Tahiti.  The causes of the mutiny are much better developed in the 1962 version with Marlon Brando and it has better writing as well.

I was drawn to this DVD primarily because of my secret love affair with Mel Gibson (he doesn't know about it; that's what makes it secret).But I was hoping the story would be exciting and well-written too.  Except for very good acting by a number of persons, including Wi Kuki Kaa as the king of Tahiti and father of Christian Fletcher (Gibson)'s love interest (That little--never mind.)Considering both Gibson and Sir Anthony can act with both hands tied behind their back balancing a dolphin on their heads, I was not surprised by the  characterizations of Mssrs. Bligh and Christian--a ray of light in the film.  The scenery is magnificent, and the storm scenes exciting. But rather than sail, it floundered.My problem with this film was believability.  In short, since the overall theme was a cruel ship's master driving his first mate and others to mutiny, I expected to find Bligh's character to be some shade of ruthless.  I also thought he was supposed to run the ship with obsessive authoritarianism, carping at the crew for the slightest departure from English decorum.  A scene of the crew dancing reluctantly to a fiddle tune (the world's first aerobics class!) certainly exhibited a difference between captain and crew as to what they thought sailors should be doing.  But is that any different than drills current people in the service (whether in Britain or elsewhere) are told to do?  At any rate, the dance &quot;class&quot; seemed more the idea and for the enjoyment of the 3rd in command, who seemed to get a lot of joy out of it, not the captain, who looked on nervously.It was only after several people had deserted, his first mate directly disobeyed orders, and all the sailors were involved in behavior not appropriate for officers to be doing in public, that he really made waves.But that is part of the problem, too.  Up until that point, the movie seemed like an apologia for Bligh.  But after he did get fed up to the gills, ordering cruel punishments for small infractions, and re-ordering the ship back through a dangerous zone for his own glory, that didn't seem the case. Note, however, that all this occurred after the mutineers were hatching their plot. Neither Bligh nor Christian come out smelling like an anenome in this seafaring tale.This would have been a fine movie to rent.  It's exciting at points, beautiful, and romantic.  But as a story, it does not hang together well.  I would not recommend shelling out any fins to buy it.(But don't pirate it either, that's illegal).",3,Confusing,1086307200,"06 4, 2004",2004,2625,"['must', 'say', 'first', 'film', 'book', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fully', 'exposed', 'concerning', 'Bounty', 'men', 'was', 'drawn', 'DVD', 'primarily', 'secret', 'love', 'affair', 'Mel', 'Gibson', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'secret', '.But', 'was', 'hoping', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'exciting', 'well-written', 'too', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'number', 'persons', 'including', 'Wi', 'Kuki', 'Kaa', 'king', 'Tahiti', 'father', 'Christian', 'Fletcher', 'Gibson', 'love', 'interest', 'little', 'never', 'mind', 'Considering', 'Gibson', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'can', 'act', 'hands', 'tied', 'back', 'balancing', 'dolphin', 'heads', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'characterizations', 'Mssrs', 'Bligh', 'Christian', 'ray', 'light', 'film', 'scenery', 'magnificent', 'storm', 'exciting', 'rather', 'sail', 'floundered.My', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'believability', 'short', 'overall', 'theme', 'was', 'cruel', 'ship', 'master', 'driving', 'first', 'mate', 'others', 'mutiny', 'expected', 'find', 'Bligh', 'character', 'be', 'shade', 'ruthless', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'supposed', 'run', 'ship', 'obsessive', 'authoritarianism', 'carping', 'crew', 'slightest', 'departure', 'English', 'decorum', 'scene', 'crew', 'dancing', 'reluctantly', 'fiddle', 'tune', 'world', 'first', 'aerobics', 'class', 'certainly', 'exhibited', 'difference', 'captain', 'crew', 'what', 'thought', 'sailors', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'different', 'drills', 'current', 'people', 'service', 'Britain', 'elsewhere', 'are', 'told', 'do', 'rate', 'dance', 'quot', 'class', 'quot', 'seemed', 'more', 'idea', 'enjoyment', '3rd', 'command', 'who', 'seemed', 'get', 'lot', 'joy', 'not', 'captain', 'who', 'looked', 'nervously.It', 'was', 'only', 'several', 'people', 'had', 'deserted', 'first', 'mate', 'directly', 'disobeyed', 'orders', 'sailors', 'were', 'involved', 'behavior', 'not', 'appropriate', 'officers', 'be', 'doing', 'public', 'really', 'made', 'waves.But', 'part', 'problem', 'too', 'Up', 'point', 'movie', 'seemed', 'apologia', 'Bligh', 'did', 'get', 'fed', 'up', 'gills', 'ordering', 'cruel', 'punishments', 'small', 'infractions', 're-ordering', 'ship', 'back', 'dangerous', 'zone', 'own', 'glory', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'case', 'Note', 'however', 'occurred', 'mutineers', 'were', 'hatching', 'plot', 'Bligh', 'Christian', 'come', 'out', 'smelling', 'anenome', 'seafaring', 'tale.This', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'movie', 'rent', 'exciting', 'points', 'beautiful', 'romantic', 'story', 'not', 'hang', 'together', 'well', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'shelling', 'out', 'fins', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'pirate', 'either', 'illegal']",The Bounty VHS
376585,A30TK6U7DNS82R,630347151X,Kevin Killian,"[1, 2]","Mel Gibson is appealing and charismatic as Fletcher Christian.  Much more so than the 1935 version, Donaldson's BOUNTY depicts the mutiny as a clash in values arising from Britain's hidebound class system, with Fletcher Christian the Cavalier and Captain Bligh the Roundhead, Christian the noble bohemian and Bligh the civil servant obnssesed with getting head in the world by hook or by crook, a man with a vision so small he can't see the big picture.  In the 1935 version, you'd imagine that Clark Gable came from a lower class than Charles Laughton, but here it's all so clear.  Casting Olivier as the one of the officers on the impugning admiralty panel was a stroke of genius (besides giving the movie that touch of class) in the way that he clearly cannot understand Hopkins' Uriah Heep-style singlemindedness.David Lean wanted to make this movie in the late 1970s and he had the boat made to his specifications years before.  Robert Bolt's script was originally written in two parts, THE LAWBREAKERS and THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW, and Lean spent four years trying to get Warner Brothers to back him properly.  When Bolt had a stroke, Lean despaired of ever being allowed to make the picture he wanted to, and abandoned his sketches and went on to think about his alternative project, Forster's PASSAGE TO INDIA.  In the meantime, severely cheaper director Roger Donaldson was given Bolt's script and asked to make a single picture from it.He showed a Lean-like appreciation of nature vs. civilization, the photographer's eye, even a Lean-like casting sense, with early appearances by Liam Neeson and Daniel Day Lewis.  Hopkins gives the picture its gravitas, Gibson its glamor.  He is crazy good looking in this part, a true successor to Gable and Brando.  Funny how he plays a fellow called ""Christian"" in this movie, and then got all Christian in real life!

376588,A1L43KWWR05PCS,630347151X,Lawyeraau,"[1, 1]","Deftly directed by Roger Donaldson and beautifully acted, this is a well nuanced film. Based upon a true story and adapted from the book, ""Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian"", by Richard Hough, the film relates the series of events that brought about the eventual mutiny of the English vessel, The Bounty, by its crew. The mutiny was led by Fletcher Christian, the Master's Mate, and friend of Lt. William Bligh, Captain of the ship. The film opens with the trial of Captain Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) before the Admiralty Board, where he is questioned by Captain Greetham (Edward Fox) and Admiral Hood (Laurence Olivier). Captain Bligh then relates his account of why it was that he lost a ship under his command.The star-crossed voyage of ""The Bounty"" started innocuously enough. Captain William Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) convinced his friend, Fletcher Christian (Mel Gibson), to set sail with him as Master's Mate to Ship Master John Fryer (Daniel Day Lewis). ""The Bounty"" was commissioned to set sail for Tahiti in order to obtain breadfruit plants for transport to Jamaica. In order to save time, the Captain would navigate a little used route around the horn of Africa to save time. It was to be a voyage to remember.During the voyage, the viewer sees the tension build amongst the crew, as well as amongst the officers. The innate savagery and baseness of some of the seamen is personified by Charles Churchill (Liam Neeson), a seaman who needs little provocation. The disdain of the officers for the crew is best exemplified by John Fryer, the ship's Master, who seems to relish the cruelty of the punishments meted out to those crewmen found guilty of infractions. Tension then spills over between the crew and officers, as the rigors of the voyage eats away at morale. By the time the ship reaches Tahiti, the die is cast. Months on the lovely island creates a false reality and an indolence that sets the stage for what is to come. Fletcher's erotic romance with a Tahitian princess further erodes discipline and strains the friendship between Bligh and Christian. By the time they finally shove off and set sail back to England with the breadfruit plants that they had sought, the end is near.Mel Gibson does a superb job with the role of Fletcher Christian. The viewer first sees him as an ambitious, yet kindly young man, who, having weathered the rigors and cruelties of the voyage, finds romance and peace on the idyllic island of Tahiti. Setting sail to return home and once again encountering the rigors and reality of a sea voyage, Christian seems to be a man on the verge of a nervous breakdown. With morale low among the crew, he makes a life defining decision. The rest is history.Anthony Hopkins is simply brilliant in the role of William Bligh. Playing him as a hard working, by the book captain, he creates a three dimensional character that is sympathetic. Betrayed by friendship and beset by the fates, Bligh manages to pull together and save those men who were cast adrift in a dinghy with him. Masterful and mindful of his professional obligations, he makes an astounding voyage, believable because of the qualities of character infused in him by Hopkins' portrayal. The viewer senses, however, that he will forever be at a loss to comprehend Christian's actions.This is a visually beautiful film, with stunningly lush island scenes. There is an original musical score by Vangelis that is wonderfully atmospheric. The performances by the cast are superlative. What more could a film lover ask for?

That proposal is that Captain (actually ""Lieutenant"") Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) was a working class stiff trying to be upward mobil and had basically a working class mouth -- i. e. he was too verbally abusive, not the fictional physical sadist that Charles Laughton portrayed in the 1930s classic.Moreover like every would-be middle class sort Bligh was a sexual prig of sorts and deeply resented ""Mr Christian's"" (Mel Gibson) liason with the comely Tahitian chief's daughter -- indeed a hint of suppressed homosexual attraction and jealousy is present. Bligh though is a great sailor and a genuinely brave man; Christian in this film is the self-indulgent one, the upper class ""gentleman"" who yields to temptation and even a sexual obsession which turns out, it appears, to be rather less rewarding than the ""south sea paradise"" it may have suggested.The principals are, as usual, very fine in their roles -- Hopkins is a bit ""mannered"" as his performances often are but Gibson is straight on, ""clean"" and Daniel Day Lewis shows up in a supporting role in which he manifests his ""darkly"" mysterious persona.

Instead of the 'control freak' monster portrayed in earlier films, we see a man with poor interpersonal skills who is nevertheless trying to be a good leader. After the mutiny, Bligh, along with some loyal followers, was cast adrift on the open ocean to face what was an almost certain death. However, the mutineers did not appreciate just what an excellent seaman and navigator Bligh was. Thanks to his outstanding abilities, the small boat was steered across thousands of miles of sea to eventual safety. The director has portrayed this part of the movie particularly well and, even knowing the outcome, there is still a palpable tension felt by the viewer.Roger Donaldson has focused on the difficulties of ship life during the 1700's and shown the tensions that can so easily arise living such a precarious life. Tensions that, in the case of the Bounty, led to the infamous mutiny. The cinematography is excellent, you could really believe a camera was following the ship and crew around Cape Horn, and nothing has been lost in transferring it to DVD. The picture is clear and the colours well saturated.Featuring such names as Anthony Hopkins (Bligh), Mel Gibson (Christian), Liam Neeson and Daniel Day Lewis, to name but a few, this is a film that is well worth watching.

No problem there. The plot lingers too long in the ""paradisio"" south sea island scenes. They had to get the characters in ""love"" [sex] affairs with the native women - and one in particular [Christian] takes up much too much time.

Although Robert Bolt's original screenplay has been masterfully compressed from it's lavish and detailed original six hour length, the core ideas Lean and Bolt were attracted to remain intact.The conflict in this superior version of the classic tale is not so much between Christian and Bligh as it is between savagery and civilization.No computer-generated images can yet compete with the recreation of a full-scale Bounty.  To see it gracefully slicing the open seas of the South Pacific is a delight.

It is, of course, the story of HMS Bounty, and her ill-fated trip to Tahiti in the 18th Century. This version is closest to the interpretation of what happened there that most historians favor today. Bligh (Anthony Hopkins) is neither hero nor villain--merely a sea captain faced with the task of taking his ship on a two-year journey to the other side of the world--a journey that would roughly compare today with a space voyage to Mars. Bligh was picked to captain this voyage for the very good reason that he was reckoned at that time to be the best navigator in the British Navy. (Bligh had been Navigator for the great Captain Cook on that earlier voyage to the South Seas).This is an incredible story, done twice before of course. This version is far and away my favorite. There are no stereotype heros or villains in this telling. Gibson is simply wonderful as Fletcher Christian, Hopkins as Bligh rings true. The rest of the cast is similarly excellent.As superb as the movie was, the best part of the movie is the outstanding theme music by Vangelis. The music is beautiful, haunting, and not to be forgotten.

This is to discuss the quality of the release for sale at amazon, in this case the DVD. When one writes an online review, the first thing to answer is: How do you rate this DVD? and not: How do you rate this movie!  Well, the DVD unfortunately is a disgrace to the studio MGM. With the monaural VHS tape of &quot;The Bounty&quot;, they have already proven that they are totally ignorant to audio quality, but the DVD even manages to top this. The dialogues, especially in the latter half of the movie, are so distorted (clipping) that is is impossible to watch this movie with any kind of enjoyment. Although encoded in Dolby Digital, the rear speakers are dead quiet for all but one very brief scene. The same applies for the subwoofer channel, which might as well be out for lunch, even in the scene where the ship gets hammered by giant waves near Cape Horn. To make matters worse, the image quality is also well below average, which is particularly disappointing for an anamorphic transfer such as this. There are compression artefacts throughout and a lack of detail which makes me wonder what transfer MGM actually used to produce this DVD. My guess is they dug up some old letterbox tape from their vaults and gained anamorphic format by way of interpolation. There are no bonus features of any kind, not even English subtitles. To anyone who, like me, loves &quot;The Bounty&quot; and the brilliant performances by Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins, I recommend not to buy this DVD - you will inevitably end up with a lot of anger and a sour stomach!

Bounty is sent to Tahiti to pick up bread plants to bring to Jamaica so the slaves there can be fed for cheap.  As well, the Bounty and its crew will circumvent the world while completing their mission.  At first, the Bounty's mission goes off perfectly but soon enough problems arise as tension develops between Lt. William Bligh and First Officer Fletcher Christian.  After watching Bligh mistreat the crew, Christian decides he has seen enough and takes matters into his own hand.  This story has already been done twice but this one has a much different tone to it.  There is something unexplainable about the movie, but it is still very good.  The musical score by Vangelis is very well placed to show the rising tension as the confrontation between the two men draws nearer.Mel Gibson is very good as First Officer Fletcher Christian.  Taking the role played by both Clark Gable and Marlon Brando is not easy, but he steps into the role very well.  Anthony Hopkins' performance as Lt. William Bligh is equally as good.  This Bligh is much more sympathetic than Charles Laughton or Trevor Howard although he is very unlikable when he finally does crack.  Laurence Olivier and Edward Fox are excellent as two officers at Bligh's trial trying to find out what went wrong.  The film also stars Daniel-Day Lewis, Liam Neeson, and Bernard Hill in good roles.  The DVD offers the widescreen presentation and a theatrical trailer.  This is a very enjoyable movie with an excellent cast and beautiful cinematography in the Tahitian islands.

That was the fate of Roger Donaldson's The Bounty back in 1984 when none of them were exactly box-office certainties. Indeed, the third dramatization of the British Navy's most infamous act of piracy (excluding the semi-documentary In the Wake of the Bounty) and is perhaps best remembered today as the flop that David Lean nearly directed before falling out with Dino De Laurentiis (UA studio boss Steven Bach infamously greenlit Heaven's Gate instead of a Lean version!). It certainly deserves to be better remembered, boasting a superb screenplay by Robert Bolt (originally intended as two films: the second, dealing with the aftermath was quietly dropped after this tanked) that owes a lot more to history than previous versions despite its occasional inaccuracies.A young Mel Gibson impresses as the weak Fletcher Christian, drawn into rebelling more by place and circumstances than a catalogue of tyranny, but it's Anthony Hopkins' film all the way. Before his irretrievable descent into ham he was a much more restrained screen actor, and his Captain Bligh is a much more interesting creation than you suspect he'd manage today. Fighting his own demons in a permissive place that rips away the moral repressions of his crew and creates a culture of defiance and inertia that he is unable to combat by either understanding or discipline (if anything, Bligh's fault here is that he is too slack on the men for too long before disastrously overcompensating on the return voyage), the film is punctuated by images of his desperately haunted face as he is faced with the realization of his escalating failure and impotence. Yet it is ultimately Bligh who triumphs and is vindicated in this version, with Christian and his mutineers left at each other's throats as they are cast out of paradise and stranded on a barren shore.It's impressive, powerful stuff, even more so today for its reality. No cgi, few model shots, they built a real ship and took it to sea for real (even Master and Commander was almost entirely shot in a studio tank in Mexico), and the hardships and efforts pay dividends on screen. Donaldson's direction is better than anything he's done since, Arthur Ibbetson's cinematography impressive and even Vangelis' much maligned score has some of the psychological savagery you can find in Alex North's work on Spartacus. Only a hammy Edward Fox (sparingly used, thankfully) and a superanuated Laurence Olivier strike the odd bum note in the court of inquiry scenes that provide the film's solid framework. I for one would love to see the second Bolt script, The Long Arm, finally make it to the screen some day - hard to believe, but it's a much better tale by far.",5,Superb overlooked epic drama,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,2789,"['How', 'could', 'film', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'sink', 'trace', 'was', 'fate', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'Bounty', 'back', '1984', 'when', 'none', 'were', 'exactly', 'box-office', 'certainties', 'Indeed', 'third', 'dramatization', 'British', 'Navy', 'most', 'infamous', 'act', 'piracy', 'excluding', 'semi-documentary', 'Wake', 'Bounty', 'perhaps', 'best', 'remembered', 'today', 'flop', 'David', 'Lean', 'nearly', 'directed', 'falling', 'out', 'Dino', 'De', 'Laurentiis', 'UA', 'studio', 'boss', 'Steven', 'Bach', 'infamously', 'greenlit', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'instead', 'Lean', 'version', 'certainly', 'be', 'better', 'remembered', 'boasting', 'superb', 'screenplay', 'Robert', 'Bolt', 'originally', 'intended', 'two', 'films', 'second', 'dealing', 'aftermath', 'was', 'quietly', 'dropped', 'tanked', 'lot', 'more', 'history', 'previous', 'versions', 'occasional', 'inaccuracies.A', 'young', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'weak', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'drawn', 'rebelling', 'more', 'place', 'circumstances', 'catalogue', 'tyranny', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'film', 'way', 'irretrievable', 'descent', 'ham', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'restrained', 'screen', 'actor', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'creation', 'suspect', ""'d"", 'manage', 'today', 'Fighting', 'own', 'demons', 'permissive', 'place', 'away', 'moral', 'repressions', 'crew', 'culture', 'defiance', 'inertia', 'unable', 'combat', 'understanding', 'discipline', 'anything', 'Bligh', 'fault', 'here', 'too', 'slack', 'men', 'too', 'long', 'before', 'disastrously', 'overcompensating', 'return', 'voyage', 'film', 'punctuated', 'images', 'desperately', 'haunted', 'face', 'faced', 'realization', 'escalating', 'failure', 'impotence', 'ultimately', 'Bligh', 'who', 'triumphs', 'vindicated', 'version', 'Christian', 'mutineers', 'left', 'other', 'throats', 'are', 'cast', 'paradise', 'stranded', 'barren', 'shore.It', 'impressive', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'today', 'reality', 'cgi', 'few', 'model', 'shots', 'built', 'real', 'ship', 'took', 'sea', 'real', 'even', 'Master', 'Commander', 'was', 'almost', 'entirely', 'shot', 'studio', 'tank', 'Mexico', 'hardships', 'efforts', 'pay', 'dividends', 'screen', 'Donaldson', 'direction', 'better', 'anything', 'done', 'Arthur', 'Ibbetson', 'cinematography', 'impressive', 'even', 'Vangelis', 'much', 'maligned', 'score', 'psychological', 'savagery', 'can', 'find', 'Alex', 'North', 'work', 'Spartacus', 'Only', 'hammy', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'sparingly', 'used', 'thankfully', 'superanuated', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'strike', 'odd', 'bum', 'note', 'court', 'inquiry', 'scenes', 'provide', 'film', 'solid', 'framework', 'one', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'second', 'Bolt', 'script', 'Long', 'Arm', 'finally', 'make', 'screen', 'day', 'hard', 'believe', 'much', 'better', 'tale', 'far']",The Bounty VHS

Perhaps the cruelty of the times caused him to treat his men so harshly, perhaps it was the code of the Royal Navy in order to maintain discipline, but either way Hopkins pulled it off perfectly.  I thought how these early rolls gave him the power to play Hannibal Lecter so well in later films.There is no way to judge the actions of a mutineer by today's standards, but I agreed with Fletcher Christion for the leniency toward the crew that would have kept the ship in tact and in the Master's command.  Beatings, whippings, hitting a man on his bare buttox while is sprawled over a cannon, and depriving the men of the freedom they had been granted for over three months on Tahiti set the captain up for the mutiny.How could men who had not been all that happy with a captain consumed to circumnavigate the globe on his personal quest, thereby bringing them in grave danger, be trusted?  This was particularly true when this captain punished men for simply speaking out -- not against him -- but with questions about his command to return to Cape Horn where they had all nearly died in a bitter 31 day battle against the sea, which had won.  They did not make it around Cape Horn the first time when their crew was full and energetic.  Though he was warned privately by his First Mate, he still refused to listen.This is also a love story about men who fell in love with their native wives and did not want to lose them.  Had they not followed the captain's orders to return to the boat, without further shore leave, they would have been flogged or shot.  Perhaps if Captain Bly had not been so rigid and Puritanical, this story would never have happened, but it is as alive and full of questions now as it was then.This is a deep story.

The story documents the plight of an ambitious British Navy lieutenant, William Bligh, who is placed in charge of HMS Bounty and sent around the world on a voyage to cultivate Breadfruit trees in  Tahiti, and sail them to Jamaica as food for slaves. He accepts the task, if only to prove himself for promotion as a Captain, and in doing so he asks his friend and fellow seaman, Fletcher Christian, to join him on the voyage.Like all great characters, Bligh is a flawed character who leads with his ego and at the best of times his leadership skills are quite inconsistent. For a British Naval officer who's word is law, this is a problem. He is among a seasoned crew of sailors who observe his ever move and when he falters he cracks the whip of discipline. Not a good leader as many would attest to. So when his officers and men fall into the seductive spell and love culture of Tahiti and his friend Fletcher Christian falls in love with the daughter of the Polynesian Chief,  Bligh finds himself in the predicament of having to bring law and order back to the workings of the BountyPerhaps the British Navy should have taught a little psychology in leadership to potential Captains, but it wasn't around in those days so Bligh's discipline methods as a leader were harsh and hateful. And Mr. Bligh looses his ship to a mutiny.This is the first film about the mutiny to be told from the Captain's point of view. Instead of vilifying the Captain's attitude we begin to understand his needs for discipline if not his methods for achieving them. Anthony Hopkins is great as the anxious William Bligh. And I think this is one of Mel Gibson's best performances as an actor. Other parts go to Liam Neeson as a devilish crew member and Daniel Day Lewis as the first officer.The wide screen photography is breath-taking, transporting us on a voyage to another world of spectacular, beautiful places.While I love the music composition of Vangelis, I find listening to the sounds of modern electronic synthesizers while watching the voyage of a wooden boat from 1789 a distraction. Seems they could have hired an orchestra to bring the quality of Vangelis's fine musical score to life.",5,The miss-adventures of William Bligh,1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,2275,"['Bounty', 'adventure/drama', 'set', 'high', 'seas', 'islands', 'South', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'story', 'documents', 'plight', 'ambitious', 'British', 'Navy', 'lieutenant', 'William', 'Bligh', 'who', 'placed', 'charge', 'HMS', 'Bounty', 'sent', 'world', 'voyage', 'cultivate', 'Breadfruit', 'trees', 'Tahiti', 'sail', 'Jamaica', 'food', 'slaves', 'task', 'only', 'prove', 'promotion', 'Captain', 'doing', 'so', 'friend', 'fellow', 'seaman', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'join', 'voyage.Like', 'great', 'characters', 'Bligh', 'flawed', 'character', 'who', 'ego', 'best', 'times', 'leadership', 'skills', 'are', 'quite', 'inconsistent', 'British', 'Naval', 'officer', 'who', 'word', 'law', 'problem', 'seasoned', 'crew', 'sailors', 'who', 'observe', 'ever', 'move', 'when', 'whip', 'discipline', 'Not', 'good', 'leader', 'many', 'would', 'attest', 'So', 'when', 'officers', 'men', 'fall', 'seductive', 'spell', 'love', 'culture', 'Tahiti', 'friend', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'love', 'daughter', 'Polynesian', 'Chief', 'Bligh', 'predicament', 'having', 'bring', 'law', 'order', 'back', 'workings', 'BountyPerhaps', 'British', 'Navy', 'should', 'have', 'taught', 'little', 'psychology', 'leadership', 'potential', 'Captains', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'days', 'so', 'Bligh', 'discipline', 'methods', 'leader', 'were', 'harsh', 'hateful', 'Mr.', 'Bligh', 'ship', 'mutiny.This', 'first', 'film', 'mutiny', 'be', 'told', 'Captain', 'point', 'view', 'Instead', 'vilifying', 'Captain', 'attitude', 'begin', 'understand', 'needs', 'discipline', 'not', 'methods', 'achieving', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'great', 'anxious', 'William', 'Bligh', 'think', 'one', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'best', 'performances', 'actor', 'Other', 'parts', 'go', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'devilish', 'crew', 'member', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'first', 'officer.The', 'wide', 'screen', 'photography', 'breath-taking', 'transporting', 'voyage', 'world', 'spectacular', 'beautiful', 'places.While', 'love', 'music', 'composition', 'Vangelis', 'find', 'listening', 'sounds', 'modern', 'electronic', 'synthesizers', 'watching', 'voyage', 'wooden', 'boat', '1789', 'distraction', 'could', 'have', 'hired', 'orchestra', 'bring', 'quality', 'Vangelis', 'fine', 'musical', 'score', 'life']",The Bounty VHS

376622,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,630347151X,Wuchak,"[16, 16]","The 1935 black & White version of ""Mutiny on the bounty"" may have won an oscar for Best Picture at the time, but will likely strike modern viewers as dated and unrealistic. Marlon Brando's 1962 remake is the most epic, captivating and compelling version even though it failed at the box office when first released; indeed the '62 version is a masterpiece (see my Amazon review). But Mel Gibson's 1984 version, simply called""The Bounty,"" is without doubt the most historically accurate and realistic film version of the infamous mutiny.THE PLOT: The Bounty mutiny story is so fascinating because it's TRUE. William Bligh, as acting captain, was sent on a mission in December 1787 to bring breadfruit plants from Tahiti back to England. Bligh intended on circumnavigating the globe in fulfilling the mission. Unfortunately he and his crew failed to get around Cape Horn, South America, and had to go the long way around Africa. It thus took them 10 months to reach Tahiti, wherein they were forced to stay another 5 months due to the breadfruit's ""dormant"" period. The natives were friendly and the women beautiful. It comes as no surprise that the crew naturally fell under the spell of the Polynesian paradise; Fletcher Christian even married the King's daughter, Maimiti. But after 5 months they had to get on with their mission and return to Naval discipline and England. Three and a half weeks later on April 28, 1789, Fletcher took over the ship with 18 other mutineers. 22 remained loyal to Bligh and 2 others were neutral. Christian set bligh and 18 loyalists adrift in the ship's launch boat and then sailed back to Tahiti where he dropped off 16 men but picked up 6 Tahitian men and 11 native women, including Maimiti. Fletcher then set forth with 8 other mutineers and the Tahitians to elude the Royal Navy, ultimately settling on Pitcairn Island, which was well off the beaten path and misplaced on Royal charts, seemingly a perfect hiding place to live out the rest of their days.WHAT WORKS: As already stated ""The Bounty"" is the most historically accurate version. It also has the most realistic vibe, which isn't to say that the '62 version isn't believable, it's just that this '84 version strikes the viewer as completely REAL. It's almost as if the film takes you back in time to view the actual events.This version also gives the most balanced and positive portrayal of the infamous Captain Bligh, played by Anthony Hopkins to great effect. Indeed the film stresses that he was exonerated in the matter. But it also hints of his character flaws that ultimately provoked the mutiny. In real life Bligh had a bad tempor and was abusive & insulting to his subordinates. The other two versions show an event that really happened on the Bounty: two big cheeses came up missing on the ship and Bligh unjustly blamed and punished members of his crew even though it was he himself that stold them!Perhaps Bligh's biggest flaw was that he lacked the ability to inspire loyalty in others; by all accounts he was a real bastage to be around when he was in authority. Lending creedance to this is the fact that, even though he was exonerated in the Bounty case, he provoked ANOTHER mutiny years later in New South Wales, Australia!Despite all this Bligh was certainly a brilliant seaman and navigator. The film shows this with Bligh and the 18 loyalists on the adrift launch. After failing to settle on near islands due to unfriendly natives, Bligh navigates the small craft over 3600 miles to Timor in 47 days on very few provisions. He didn't have any charts or compass. All he had was a sextant and a pocket watch. Although all of the loyalists survived this incredible journey 5 later died due to ailments sustained in the voyage. The '62 version barely addresses this miraculous event but ""The Bounty"" devotes quite a few scenes to it.The score by Vangelis is very fitting. The best part of this composition is heard during the end credits. The film shows Fletcher, the mutineers and the Tahitians stranded on Pitcairn as they sadly observeThe Bounty go down in flames. They know they can never go home again. Vangelis' unique piece then plays out over the credits. It perfectly captures the mood and setting. It's so magnificent sometimes I just play the end credits sequence. It's definitely one of the most emotionally potent endings in motion picture history.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Although Gibson is more realistic as Fletcher Christian than Marlon Brando, especially since Gibson was closer to Christian's real age of 23-25 (Brando was 36-37 during filming), Mel simply lacks Brando's captivating charisma.The Tahitian scenes seem to lack pizzazz; the film almost crawls to a halt (which is the the exact opposite of Brando's version). It doesn't personally bother me because the film is attempting to show us what leads to the mutineers' decision to take the ship, but some viewers may have a problem with it, in particular those with ADD.""The Bounty"" also fails to give any glimpse of what life would offer the mutineers & Tahitians on Pitcairn Island. The '62 version, on the other hand, devotes a number of scenes to this part of the story. This is not a negative to me, however, since showing subsequent scenes on Pitcairn would ruin the powerful end sequence noted above.FINAL ANALYSIS: ""The Bounty"" is the most historically accurate and realistic version of the infamous mutiny even though Brando's version is the most epic, engaging and compelling. I recommend seeing both versions back to back, which is what I usually do. Both versions are amongst my favorite films of all time. In fact, I consider them masterpieces.The film runs 2 hours and 12 minutes; Brando's version is 3 hours.THE FATE OF THE MUTINEERS: There was ample land, water and food for the 9 mutineers, 6 Tahitian men and 11 women on Pitcairn Island. Christian naturally became the established leader and many children were born. Although Fletcher treated the native men fairly, other mutineers treated them like servants and relations deteriorated. When John Williams' native wife died he took one of the Tahitian men's women as a ""replacement,"" which naturally caused the Polynesian men to revolt. This conflict took place 3.5 years after they arrived on Pitcairn. The result was that five of the mutineers died, including Christian, and all six of the Tahitian men. Of the four remaining mutineers, one died in a drunken fall and Quintal was killed by the other two after a drunken fit of rage. The remaining two mutineers had a bible from the ship and became devout Christians, converting the Tahitian women and children and holding regular church services. Peace and goodwill reigned in the colony. Ned Young died in 1800 of asthma leaving John Adams (aka Alex Smith), 9 women and 23 children to be discovered by an American whaling vessel in 1808. Adams was interestingly granted amnesty by the British government. Today Pitcairn is home to about 50 people from 9 families, most descendants of the mutineers and Tahitians. Many adherents of Seventh-Day Adventism due to a mission in the 1890s.",5,The most accurate and realistic version of the infamous mutiny,1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,7086,"['1935', 'black', 'White',

376623,A1DZSBTVCJ883,630347151X,W. Walker,"[4, 4]","By far, my favortie adventure drama film! My only complaint is the opening and background music. It could have used a rousing ""Gone with the Wind"" memorable theme song instead of the somber haunting music employed. I liked the back and forth switches between Bligh's official enquiry and the story of the Bounty. I don't agree with the too common assessment that Bligh and Christian were both deeply flawed men. This film succeeds in presenting them in a balanced manner. I believe Bligh was mostly a victim of a very unusual set of circumstances. Officially, he was only a first lieutenant, not a captain. Unlike normal crown ventures, he lacked commissioned officers and marines to back up his authority, a critical point the film fails to bring out. Apparently, there is no evidence to back up the implication that Bligh announced his intension to sail around Cape Horn, thus provoking the mutiny. It seems plain that the instigation for the mutiny had mainly to do with the very long(5 months) layover in a paradise of willing girls and relative leisure, which many of the crew, including Christian, preferred to continue over a return to naval drudgery and discipline and an ultimate return to England. Christian apparently, as the film dramatized, had also accumulated an intolerable load of recent brow beatings by Bligh. Apparently, he had considered suicide shortly before the mutiny as the only practical way out of his conflicting feelings, as the film may suggest. It is painfully obvious that the prudish aloof Bligh feels very unconfortable in the leisurely free love atmosphere of Tahiti that most of his men relish.  Thus, he seems to his crew a different species all together.I found this version of the Bounty story far superior to previous versions in terms of its characterization of Bligh and Christian and its overall realism. Anthony Hopkins was unbeatable as Bligh, and should have won an academy award. In contrast to some reviewers, I found Mel Gibson entirely adequate as the real Christian. Some prefer Gable's heroic rabble-rousing version of Christian which fit in with other 1930s swashbucking adventure tales. In terms of realism, it also helped that Gibson was much closer to the real Christian's age of 22 than either Gable or Brando.  A few reviewers object to the extensive realistic portrayal of bare-breasted nymphomaniac native maidens, something the strict codes of the mid-1930s wouldn't allow.
