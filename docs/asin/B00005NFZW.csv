As a Michael McDonald fan way back from the Doobie Bros. time, I thought they really botched this performance. Some of the songs were very good but it seemed they ran out of good stuff and tried to use allot of fillers!!! And what the heck was Jeff Bridges doing there??? He can't sing!!! He should stick to movies!!! I rate this concert ""POOR"" !!!  Sorry, but if you Love Michael McDonalds Voice, Stick to the CD's",2,What were they thinking?,1056844800,"06 29, 2003",2003,467,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'expect', 'people', 'buy', 'dvd', 'Michael', 'McDonald', 'way', 'back', 'Doobie', 'Bros.', 'time', 'thought', 'really', 'botched', 'performance', 'songs', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'seemed', 'ran', 'good', 'stuff', 'tried', 'use', 'allot', 'fillers', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'doing', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'should', 'stick', 'movies', 'rate', 'concert', 'POOR', 'Sorry', 'Love', 'Michael', 'McDonalds', 'Voice', 'Stick', 'CD']",N/A

Speaking of hosts who's the toots who comes on and introduces Jeff Bridges and James Ingram she's gorgeous but gets no credit on the DVD. Anyway I really like this DVD the Doobie Brothers are great, lovely to see Christopher Cross on stage too and I even liked Kenny Loggins even though I've never really forgiven him for telling Bill Champlin not to too join Chicago lucky Bill didn't listen because gee where's Kenny been lately? (who cares).Gee I do like that song 'This is it' though.Anyway this DVD is highly recommended if your a Michael McDonald fan.",4,Pretty good,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,801,"['really', 'Michael', 'McDonald', 'voice', 'distinctive', 'soulful.I', 'notice', 'lot', 'criticism', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'song', 'must', 'admit', 'song', 'great', 'singing', 'appalling', 'Michael', 'McDonald', 'playing', 'secong', 'fiddle', 'Jeff', 'PLEASE', 'Speaking', 'hosts', 'who', 'toots', 'who', 'introduces', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'James', 'Ingram', 'gorgeous', 'credit', 'DVD', 'Anyway', 'really', 'DVD', 'Doobie', 'Brothers', 'are', 'great', 'lovely', 'see', 'Christopher', 'Cross', 'stage', 'too', 'even', 'liked', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'forgiven', 'telling', 'Bill', 'Champlin', 'not', 'too', 'join', 'Chicago', 'lucky', 'Bill', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'because', 'gee', 'where', 'Kenny', 'been', 'lately', 'who', '.Gee', 'do', 'song', 'though.Anyway', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Michael', 'McDonald', 'fan']",N/A

667955,A5TZXWU8AALIC,B00005NFZW,The JuRK,"[5, 6]","As a big Michael McDonald fan, I'm taking one star off my review for a couple of reasons:The first is that I'm sure there were more songs in the actual show they taped for this special, so I feel the entire show should've been included.  (I'm not sure, but I would think--with all that talent there--the show had more).The second is that I feel another DVD, the SOUNDSTAGE show, is a better feel of a Michael McDonald concert (it includes guests as well, but not the crowd that shows up for this DVD).Otherwise, of course, I'm going to have this.  It's Michael, and he's singing a lot of his hits with the people he either wrote with and/or recorded with.So the DVD is definitely worth having to see so many stars together on stage.(By the way, that's Kim Carnes, who had the hits ""More Love"" and ""Betty Davis Eyes,"" and Amy Holland, who had the hit ""How Do I Survive?"" and is also Michael's wife, in the back-up singers).",4,A Tribute to McD,1119830400,"06 27, 2005",2005,922,"['big', 'Michael', 'McDonald', 'fan', ""'m"", 'taking', 'one', 'star', 'review', 'couple', 'reasons', 'first', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'more', 'songs', 'actual', 'show', 'taped', 'special', 'feel', 'entire', 'show', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'included', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'think', 'talent', 'there', 'show', 'had', 'more', '.The', 'second', 'feel', 'DVD', 'SOUNDSTAGE', 'show', 'better', 'feel', 'Michael', 'McDonald', 'concert', 'guests', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'crowd', 'up', 'DVD', '.Otherwise', 'course', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'Michael', 'singing', 'lot', 'hits', 'people', 'either', 'wrote', 'and/or', 'recorded', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'worth', 'having', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'stars', 'together', 'stage', 'way', 'Kim', 'Carnes', 'who', 'had', 'hits', 'More', 'Love', 'Betty', 'Davis', 'Eyes', 'Amy', 'Holland', 'who', 'had', 'hit', 'How', 'Do', 'Survive', 'also', 'Michael', 'wife', 'back-up', 'singers']",N/A
