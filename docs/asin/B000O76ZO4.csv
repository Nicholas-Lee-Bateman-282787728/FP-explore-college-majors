1062631,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000O76ZO4,Alistair McHarg,"[5, 10]","You'd have to pry open a lot of Hollywood projection room closets to find a movie worse than Gray Matters.  This vacuous confection, which has all the nutritional value of bubble gum - and is almost as pink - skates adorably across the surface of two dark and interesting themes, both of which are treated as seriously as a Britney Spears song might treat the later works of J.P. Sartre.  These topics are, in order of appearance, 1.) a brother/sister relationship so pathologically close it borders on incestuous (see Nabokov)  2.) the emotional strain of coming out as a lesbian.  The film attempts to be a comedy - and complex, difficult subjects like these are often the grist for penetrating comedies - but Gray Matters will have none of that.  Gray Matters wants you to find it so charming that the only thought going through your mind is how to pinch its little cheek.The picture stars Heather Graham as Gray, which is a huge head start.  Graham exudes clueless charm, innocence, sincerity, and adorable determination, in addition to being a real beauty.  She labors valiantly for this movie, but there's just too much working against her.  Thomas Cavanagh, as her brother Sam, is staggeringly awful.  (That rapid fire delivery of his, recycled from Scrubs, is truly annoying - is that all he's got?)  Worse still is Bridget Moynahan who seems to believe that being built like a Victoria's Secret model is the same thing as acting - there are scenes where her derriere threatens to walk off with the picture.When second fiddles and even bit players outshine the principals, you know you've got trouble.  Mollie Shannon, as Gray's colleague is a hoot, Sissy Spacek as Gray's unconventional shrink is splendid, Alan Cumming as cabbie turned suitor is wonderful - even walk-on contributors like the wedding dress lady and the Vegas minister offer welcome relief - all because they offer distraction from the slow motion train wreck taking place.  I can't imagine anyone who has ""come out"" not being offended by the sheer superficiality and stupidity of this vehicle.With some disasters it's hard to affix blame, here it's easy.  Sue Kramer wrote and directed this 90 minute Banana Republic spread.  Even with devolution in full swing and audiences getting dimmer and more superficial by the minute, it's hard to imagine anyone, anywhere thinking this movie was worthwhile.",1,When Gray Lib Doesn't Matter At All,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,2376,"[""'d"", 'have', 'pry', 'open', 'lot', 'Hollywood', 'projection', 'room', 'closets', 'find', 'movie', 'worse', 'Gray', 'Matters', 'vacuous', 'confection', 'nutritional', 'value', 'bubble', 'gum', 'almost', 'pink', 'adorably', 'surface', 'two', 'dark', 'interesting', 'themes', 'are', 'treated', 'as', 'seriously', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'song', 'might', 'treat', 'later', 'works', 'J.P.', 'Sartre', 'topics', 'are', 'order', 'appearance', '1', 'brother/sister', 'relationship', 'so', 'pathologically', 'close', 'borders', 'incestuous', 'see', 'Nabokov', '2', 'emotional', 'strain', 'coming', 'out', 'lesbian', 'film', 'attempts', 'be', 'comedy', 'complex', 'difficult', 'subjects', 'are', 'often', 'grist', 'penetrating', 'comedies', 'Gray', 'Matters', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'Gray', 'Matters', 'find', 'so', 'charming', 'only', 'thought', 'going', 'mind', 'how', 'pinch', 'little', 'cheek.The', 'picture', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Gray', 'huge', 'head', 'start', 'Graham', 'clueless', 'charm', 'innocence', 'sincerity', 'adorable', 'determination', 'addition', 'being', 'real', 'beauty', 'valiantly', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'working', 'Thomas', 'Cavanagh', 'brother', 'Sam', 'staggeringly', 'awful', 'fire', 'delivery', 'recycled', 'Scrubs', 'truly', 'annoying', 'got', 'Worse', 'still', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'who', 'believe', 'being', 'built', 'Victoria', 'Secret', 'model', 'same', 'thing', 'acting', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'derriere', 'walk', 'off', 'picture.When', 'second', 'fiddles', 'even', 'bit', 'players', 'outshine', 'principals', 'know', ""'ve"", 'got', 'trouble', 'Mollie', 'Shannon', 'Gray', 'colleague', 'hoot', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Gray', 'unconventional', 'shrink', 'splendid', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'cabbie', 'turned', 'suitor', 'wonderful', 'even', 'walk-on', 'contributors', 'wedding', 'dress', 'lady', 'Vegas', 'minister', 'offer', 'welcome', 'relief', 'offer', 'distraction', 'slow', 'motion', 'train', 'wreck', 'taking', 'place', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'who', 'come', 'out', 'not', 'being', 'offended', 'sheer', 'superficiality', 'stupidity', 'vehicle.With', 'disasters', 'hard', 'affix', 'blame', 'here', 'easy', 'Sue', 'Kramer', 'wrote', 'directed', '90', 'minute', 'Banana', 'Republic', 'spread', 'Even', 'devolution', 'full', 'swing', 'audiences', 'getting', 'dimmer', 'more', 'superficial', 'minute', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'anywhere', 'thinking', 'movie', 'was', 'worthwhile']",Gray Matters

1062642,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000O76ZO4,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 12]","**1/2While watching ""Gray Matters"" - which marks the filmmaking debut of writer/director Sue Kramer - I kept wondering if maybe I hadn't somehow stumbled back into ""Puccini for Beginners,"" a movie I'd seen a few weeks earlier, since both are oddly similar, equally implausible tales of Manhattan yuppies involved in romantic triangles of the bisexual kind.Gray and Sam are siblings who not only live in the same apartment and spend most of their free time together but are so emotionally attached to one another that people often mistake them for a romantic couple.  As if that weren't queasy enough, the screenplay ups the ante by having the hitherto heterosexual Gray suddenly ""discover"" she's a lesbian when she falls for Sam's gorgeous new wife, Charlie (yes, I know all this can be a bit confusing, but Charlie is a woman).As with ""Puccini,"" most of what happens in ""Gray Matters"" feels contrived and artificial.  We don't believe for a second that two seemingly rational people like Sam and Charlie would become engaged after only a single date, or that even an indecisive ditz like Gray would be this in-the-dark about her own sexuality.Thus, with so little of the storyline grounded in anything even closely resembling reality, we find ourselves detached from the characters and indifferent to their fates.  That's no denigration of the lead players - Heather Graham, Thomas Cavanaugh and Bridget Monahan - all of whom are appealing and likable in their various roles.  And there are some sharp supporting performances by Molly Shannon, Alan Cumming, and Sissy Spacek as Gray's loopy therapist (though there is a brief cameo appearance by singer Gloria Gaynor that is pure unadulterated pandering).  Moreover, New York City looks all sparkly and shiny as seen through the lens of cinematographer John S. Bartley's camera.With its countless references to 40's musicals and romantic comedies, ""Gray Matters"" clearly sees itself as both an homage and a throwback to the metier and style of those earlier films.  But we are obviously living in different times, and the labored setups and screwball comedy devices that worked so well in the past feel pretty darned anachronistic and forced when employed today.  My feeling is that if you`re going to make a modern romantic comedy, one that deals with such ""contemporary"" issues as coming out and sexual identity, then make a movie that actually feels modern.  Don`t try to tuck it safely away in the past, then expect us to take any of it seriously.  Despite its taking on those relatively gutsy issues, ""Gray Matters"" really doesn't exist in anyone's world, and certainly not in the racially and economically diverse world of 21st Century Manhattan.""Gray Matters"" presents us with life as only those in the movies ever live it.",2,well-meaning but implausible romantic comedy,1187913600,"08 24, 2007",2007,2781,"['watching', 'Gray', 'Matters', 'filmmaking', 'debut', 'writer/director', 'Sue', 'Kramer', 'kept', 'wondering', 'maybe', 'had', ""n't"", 'somehow', 'stumbled', 'back', 'Puccini', 'Beginners', 'movie', ""'d"", 'seen', 'few', 'weeks', 'earlier', 'are', 'oddly', 'similar', 'equally', 'implausible', 'tales', 'Manhattan', 'yuppies', 'involved', 'romantic', 'triangles', 'bisexual', 'kind.Gray', 'Sam', 'are', 'siblings', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'live', 'same', 'apartment', 'spend', 'most', 'free', 'time', 'together', 'are', 'so', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'one', 'people', 'often', 'mistake', 'romantic', 'couple', 'were', ""n't"", 'queasy', 'enough', 'screenplay', 'ante', 'having', 'hitherto', 'heterosexual', 'Gray', 'suddenly', 'discover', 'lesbian', 'when', 'Sam', 'gorgeous', 'new', 'wife', 'Charlie', 'yes', 'know', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'confusing', 'Charlie', 'woman', 'Puccini', 'most', 'what', 'Gray', 'Matters', 'feels', 'contrived', 'artificial', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'second', 'two', 'seemingly', 'rational', 'people', 'Sam', 'Charlie', 'would', 'become', 'engaged', 'only', 'single', 'date', 'even', 'indecisive', 'ditz', 'Gray', 'would', 'be', 'in-the-dark', 'own', 'sexuality.Thus', 'so', 'little', 'storyline', 'grounded', 'anything', 'even', 'closely', 'resembling', 'reality', 'find', 'detached', 'characters', 'indifferent', 'fates', 'denigration', 'lead', 'players', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Thomas', 'Cavanaugh', 'Bridget', 'Monahan', 'whom', 'are', 'appealing', 'likable', 'various', 'roles', 'are', 'sharp', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Gray', 'loopy', 'therapist', 'brief', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'singer', 'Gloria', 'Gaynor', 'pure', 'unadulterated', 'pandering', 'Moreover', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'sparkly', 'shiny', 'seen', 'lens', 'cinematographer', 'John', 'S.', 'Bartley', 'camera.With', 'countless', 'references', '40', 'musicals', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Gray', 'Matters', 'clearly', 'homage', 'throwback', 'metier', 'style', 'earlier', 'films', 'are', 'obviously', 'living', 'different', 'times', 'labored', 'setups', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'devices', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'past', 'feel', 'pretty', 'darned', 'anachronistic', 'forced', 'when', 'employed', 'today', 'feeling', 're', 'going', 'make', 'modern', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'one', 'such', 'contemporary', 'issues', 'coming', 'out', 'sexual', 'identity', 'then', 'make', 'movie', 'actually', 'modern', 'Don', 't', 'try', 'tuck', 'safely', 'away', 'past', 'then', 'expect', 'take', 'seriously', 'taking', 'relatively', 'gutsy', 'issues', 'Gray', 'Matters', 'really', ""n't"", 'exist', 'anyone', 'world', 'certainly', 'not', 'racially', 'economically', 'diverse', 'world', '21st', 'Century', 'Manhattan', 'Gray', 'Matters', 'presents', 'life', 'only', 'movies', 'ever', 'live']",Gray Matters
