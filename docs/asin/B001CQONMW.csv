The writing and acting drastically matured, Joan, Maya, Toni, and Lynn are smart, successful, and beautiful women who always go after what they want. This show is so under-rated, it's like Sex and the City. I am so happy each season has been coming out at steady pace, only three seasons left. I highly recommend this gem of a purchase, enjoy!",5,The winning season!,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,437,"['Girlfriends', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'definitely', 'best', 'season', 'funny', 'poignant', 'show', 'writing', 'acting', 'drastically', 'matured', 'Joan', 'Maya', 'Toni', 'Lynn', 'are', 'smart', 'successful', 'beautiful', 'women', 'who', 'always', 'go', 'what', 'want', 'show', 'so', 'under-rated', 'Sex', 'City', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'season', 'been', 'coming', 'out', 'steady', 'pace', 'only', 'three', 'seasons', 'left', 'highly', 'recommend', 'gem', 'purchase', 'enjoy']",Girlfriends: Season 5

She was really great this season as we got to see her character's confusion and hurt in dealing with a man who doesn't want to be in a monogamous relationshipI have to commend this group of actors again for bringing these characters to life and the flow of the stories that kept me watching the entire season in one evening.

1177093,A3CMDR34KFLGFX,B001CQONMW,Reader2008,"[3, 3]","Now that I am on Season 5, these literally have become my friends.  I am watching through Netflix so I only get one disc at a time so it is very frustrating to me to have to wait to see what happens.Disc 1This disc introduces us to Joan's mother.  I wondered why Joan never spent the holidays with her family.  Now, we see that Joan's mother is selfish and beds younger men.  In earlier episodes we saw that Joan's father was selfish and had little to do with her.On this disc, Maya is still a book author and is the character that is showing the most growth.  I like Ronnie, the cousin, but again I am curious how someone so close to their mother could have such limited or no contact with her.Joan and William are trying to get together.  I may be one of the few people that don't want them together, but UGH! Joan is anal and crazy and William is quirky an corny; these two should not get together in my opinion.Lynne is acting ridiculous now.  She is in her 30's and has decided to become a robot.The worst written character, but MY FAVORITE, is Toni.  Toni is not likeable on disc 1.  She is beyond selfish and her over eating is out of character and annoying.  Toni fought hard to leave her Fresno roots behind and this baby has her falling asleep at meetings and eating food off other people's plates; this doesn't seem like the Toni I KNOW.  I really wish they could have found a white guy more compatible for Toni and left him in town.Disc 2Lynne meets her biological father and the meeting doesn't go well.  It is good to see from Lamont from Sanford and Son again.  Maya's agent is giving her run around so she decides to write porn.  Joan and William ended up staying in a rat infested hotel room, not having sex.  Joan and William refuse to show their affection in public.  Maya explains to us why we rarely see her son.  Lynne explains to us why we never see her sex partners and Toni explains to us why she is not living broke even though she is claiming broke.The highs of this disc is that we get to see Shirley from Laverne and Shirley an Toni is more subdued this disc.The lows of this dic are Maya's clothing.  Maya has NO butt and really should not wear low rider jeans or short shorts.  Lynne being broke and a sex fiend are way past old now.Disc 3The high of the disc was that Mary Ann from Gilligan Island shows up in an episode.  Another high of this disc is that someone changes Toni's life; we can only hope it is for the better.The low of this disc is Lynne and her her new boyfriend.  Lynne's boyfriend looks horrible, sounds horrible, and treats her horrible.  Lynne actually begs this guy to love her in bunch of a front of people; it was embarrassng.  The other low of this disc was TONI's attitude and the cradle incident.  What Toni did with the cradle was despicable.  It really is surprising that Toni has any friends.This season was GOOD, but I must say that a pregnant Toni is much worse than ordinary Toni.",4,We are getting to know the girls even more!,1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,2945,"['Now', 'am', 'Season', '5', 'literally', 'have', 'become', 'friends', 'am', 'watching', 'Netflix', 'so', 'only', 'get', 'one', 'disc', 'time', 'very', 'frustrating', 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'happens.Disc', '1This', 'disc', 'introduces', 'Joan', 'mother', 'wondered', 'why', 'Joan', 'never', 'spent', 'holidays', 'family', 'Now', 'see', 'Joan', 'mother', 'selfish', 'beds', 'younger', 'men', 'earlier', 'saw', 'Joan', 'father', 'was', 'selfish', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'her.On', 'disc', 'Maya', 'still', 'book', 'author', 'character', 'showing', 'most', 'growth', 'like', 'Ronnie', 'cousin', 'again', 'am', 'curious', 'how', 'someone', 'so', 'close', 'mother', 'could', 'have', 'such', 'limited', 'contact', 'her.Joan', 'William', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'together', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'together', 'UGH', 'Joan', 'anal', 'crazy', 'William', 'quirky', 'corny', 'two', 'should', 'not', 'get', 'together', 'opinion.Lynne', 'acting', 'ridiculous', 'now', '30', 'decided', 'become', 'robot.The', 'worst', 'written', 'character', 'MY', 'FAVORITE', 'Toni', 'Toni', 'not', 'likeable', 'disc', '1', 'selfish', 'eating', 'character', 'annoying', 'Toni', 'fought', 'hard', 'leave', 'Fresno', 'roots', 'behind', 'baby', 'falling', 'asleep', 'meetings', 'eating', 'food', 'other', 'people', 'plates', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Toni', 'KNOW', 'really', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'white', 'guy', 'more', 'compatible', 'Toni', 'left', 'town.Disc', '2Lynne', 'meets', 'biological', 'father', 'meeting', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'good', 'see', 'Lamont', 'Sanford', 'Son', 'again', 'Maya', 'agent', 'giving', 'run', 'around', 'so', 'write', 'porn', 'Joan', 'William', 'ended', 'up', 'staying', 'rat', 'infested', 'hotel', 'room', 'not', 'having', 'sex', 'Joan', 'William', 'refuse', 'show', 'affection', 'public', 'Maya', 'why', 'rarely', 'see', 'son', 'Lynne', 'why', 'never', 'see', 'sex', 'partners', 'Toni', 'why', 'not', 'living', 'broke', 'even', 'claiming', 'broke.The', 'highs', 'disc', 'get', 'see', 'Shirley', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'Toni', 'more', 'subdued', 'disc.The', 'dic', 'are', 'Maya', 'clothing', 'Maya', 'NO', 'butt', 'really', 'should', 'not', 'wear', 'low', 'rider', 'jeans', 'short', 'shorts', 'Lynne', 'being', 'broke', 'sex', 'fiend', 'are', 'way', 'old', 'now.Disc', '3The', 'high', 'disc', 'was', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'up', 'episode', 'high', 'disc', 'someone', 'Toni', 'life', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'better.The', 'low', 'disc', 'Lynne', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Lynne', 'boyfriend', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'Lynne', 'actually', 'guy', 'love', 'bunch', 'front', 'people', 'was', 'embarrassng', 'other', 'low', 'disc', 'was', 'TONI', 'attitude', 'cradle', 'incident', 'What', 'Toni', 'did', 'cradle', 'was', 'despicable', 'really', 'surprising', 'Toni', 'friends.This', 'season', 'was', 'GOOD', 'must', 'say', 'pregnant', 'Toni', 'much', 'worse', 'ordinary', 'Toni']",Girlfriends: Season 5
