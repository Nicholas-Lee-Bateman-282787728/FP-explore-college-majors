This show had the best actors, and the best team of writers of any TV show I've ever seen. Not only does the show have top notch comedy, it's also a learning experience where the stories of what the characters go through as they grow up together contain life lessons that are valuable and thought provoking.

Corey and Topanga entering into the tribulations of a relationship and Eric continuing to drive Mr. Feeny and his parents crazy by failing to live up to his potential. In Season Three itself, Shawn begins to feel a sense of longing for something more than Mr. Turner's apartment and eventually reunites with his father. Corey and Topanga break up for like five minutes, maybe five episodes in storyline terms and Eric realizes that now that he's a Senior, he needs to start developing some plan for his future leading to such hilarious episodes as to when Eric is accepted to BORIS and serves as an intern at a local television station. The show also continued its' ode to the past episodes with I once was a Teenage Spy that included cameos from Tom Boswell, Anson Williams, and Pat Morida. And Illegal Rave, which included several members of the Monkeys. The show also turned and tackled serious issues like when Corey and Shawn befriend Frankie the Enforcer or the season ending episodes where Corey struggles to deal with his brothers leaving for college and feeling like they were never really close. These episodes are easily some of my favorites throughout the series, but every BMW fan is different, this season served to lay foundation for later years.",5,Boy Faces World,1287532800,"10 20, 2010",2010,1375,"['Season', 'Three', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'up', 'much', 'where', 'Season', 'Two', 'ended', 'up', 'Shawn', 'Hunter', 'living', 'Mr.', 'Turner', 'Corey', 'Topanga', 'entering', 'tribulations', 'relationship', 'Eric', 'continuing', 'drive', 'Mr.', 'Feeny', 'parents', 'crazy', 'failing', 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'Season', 'Three', 'Shawn', 'feel', 'sense', 'longing', 'something', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Turner', 'apartment', 'eventually', 'father', 'Corey', 'Topanga', 'break', 'up', 'five', 'minutes', 'maybe', 'five', 'episodes', 'storyline', 'terms', 'Eric', 'now', 'Senior', 'start', 'developing', 'plan', 'future', 'leading', 'such', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'when', 'Eric', 'accepted', 'BORIS', 'intern', 'local', 'television', 'station', 'show', 'also', 'continued', 'ode', 'past', 'episodes', 'once', 'was', 'Teenage', 'Spy', 'included', 'cameos', 'Tom', 'Boswell', 'Anson', 'Williams', 'Pat', 'Morida', 'Illegal', 'Rave', 'included', 'several', 'members', 'Monkeys', 'show', 'also', 'turned', 'tackled', 'serious', 'issues', 'when', 'Corey', 'Shawn', 'befriend', 'Frankie', 'Enforcer', 'season', 'ending', 'episodes', 'where', 'Corey', 'deal', 'brothers', 'leaving', 'college', 'feeling', 'were', 'never', 'really', 'close', 'episodes', 'are', 'easily', 'favorites', 'series', 'BMW', 'fan', 'different', 'season', 'served', 'lay', 'foundation', 'later', 'years']",Boy Meets World - The Complete Third Season
