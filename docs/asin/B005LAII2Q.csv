I didn't know what it was or would be about. i guessed. I was wrong. It's about friends, being alone in reality (when you think you have everything, but you don't) and of course, aliens. The movie is very well tied together with goddamn great plot, dialogue and actors. If there was one thing I disliked it's the actor that played a douche bag, simply because he seemed like one. I enjoyed the movie, great special effects and humor. To some people the use of sexual content and swearing may be a little too much. I wouldn't say it was too much. While it's not the first movie about aliens, I think it was a very good comedy with great looking creatures. No bad or cheap CGI animations in here. You should try the movie, it's quite good! I myself will watch it again when the time comes! I know it's hard to please everyone, there will always be unsatisfied people, but to give THIS movie 1 stars? That's just stupid.

1479867,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005LAII2Q,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","The Watch is one of those films where initially you believe it's going to be an extremely awful comedy due to the awkward, rushed, and unfunny jokes constantly blurting all over the place without any rhyme or reason (Vince Vaughn being an extra talkative sex-obsessed moron the biggest culprit of any awkwardness to the storyline flow) but, believe it or not, there actually *are* several moments of science fiction concerning an alien invasion later on during the final 20 minutes.It's about Ben Stiller's character finally saying enough is enough when an employee of his working night shift at Costco's is brutally murdered by an alien, so he comes up with this idea to recruit a few others and start up a neighborhood watch.  It's basically a group of misfits that have no desire to actually be part of a neighborhood watch and refuse to take the job seriously, so they sit (or cruise) around town making jokes about any sexual-related thing you can imagine.  If you dislike any of this, it's undoubtedly because of Vince Vaughn's character.  He's relentless with the jokes.Now it's not just the sex jokes themselves that one could easily have a problem with- it's the way they deliberately ruin the flow of the storyline.  You see some viewers are probably tuning into the Watch to see science fiction aspects but... they certainly won't like the inappropriate words coming out of Vince's mouth.  Hey I can hardly blame them either.  Constantly comparing green alien gunk to... you-know-what, is pretty gross.  Sometimes however, the obnoxious and immature nature of the neighborhood watch group manages to be funny (such as, to name one example, after a kid is caught throwing eggs at the neighborhood watch, he's quickly caught and brought to the downtown police station where the neighborhood watch feels the need to question the kid themselves in their own oddball way- a few funny moments occur here).Rather surprisingly, the storyline improves (and turns serious) later on when it's realized that aliens are actually here on earth and planning to destroy all human life.  The aliens themselves are pretty dangerous.  It's sort of funny watching the aliens throw humans across the room so they slam into walls.  Also when the aliens hide behind store aisles when the fight eventually spills out to Costco's, these are more entertaining segments.  The scenes with Ben Stiller and his wife and the realization that Ben doesn't have the ability to have children are utterly pointless, as are the ones with Vince Vaughn's daughter being disagreeable for the sake of acting like a typical teenager and going to parties despite her father not approving of her lifestyle.  These are awful.  However, how about when Ben and the boys find a helmet that can allow them to blow things up?  Awesome!  I mean *seriously* blow things up in the most explosive way imaginable!The humor... certainly an acquired taste.  I personally wouldn't blame anyone if they hated the awkward way the storyline is deliberately sabotaged in favor of oddly utilized sex jokes.

It's one of the few times where human beings can get something right as a committee. LOL ""The Watch"" bombed at the box office, only taking in about half of its estimated budget, and there were good reasons for this.This looked like an interesting idea. I like Ben Stiller in almost everything he's done. The same is true for Vince Vaughn. When I came across this film the fact that I'd never heard of it was a big warning sign. I tried it out anyway.Were there some laughs? Yes .... unfortunately only about one for every fifteen or twenty the writers intended. There is always something distracting about a movie where you recognize attempts at jokes that just aren't funny.The movie is also schizophrenic. It can't make up it's mind what it wants to be, and in the process doesn't really commit to anything. It did prove that you can't try to squeeze comedy, horror, family angst, sci-fi, drama, quirky neighbors, oddball pals and buddy schisms all into one movie. If they had picked any three or four of the above they might have gotten away with it.Next, the pacing just fails. Because of all the unnecessary elements I discussed, the movie jumps around to so many sub-plots that it continually spoils its own mood. For example, after a scary alien encounter our main characters spend a LOT of time on what are actually mundane and uninteresting family issues before the alien story gets its next dollop of attention.There are enough other problems that it wouldn't even be fair to pile on with the significant violations of the film's own internal logic concerning the aliens.Last but not least, Stiller and Vaughn tried hard, but essentially come across as parodies of some of their own past performances.It's sad. This movie was close to hitting the target. It was just enough out of sync to never capture the momentum or the mood it intended.I did like the flying flaming tiger logos and Rosemarie DeWitt in a bustier. ;-)",2,What a sad miss,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,2058,"['extreme', 'fans', 'detractors', 'movie-going', 'public', 'will', 'normally', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'correctly', 'evaluating', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'human', 'beings', 'can', 'get', 'something', 'right', 'committee', 'LOL', 'Watch', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'only', 'taking', 'half', 'estimated', 'budget', 'were', 'good', 'reasons', 'this.This', 'looked', 'interesting', 'idea', 'like', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'almost', 'everything', 'done', 'same', 'true', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'When', 'came', 'film', 'fact', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'was', 'big', 'warning', 'sign', 'tried', 'out', 'anyway.Were', 'there', 'laughs', 'Yes', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'one', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'writers', 'intended', 'always', 'something', 'distracting', 'movie', 'where', 'recognize', 'attempts', 'jokes', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny.The', 'movie', 'also', 'schizophrenic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'be', 'process', ""n't"", 'really', 'commit', 'anything', 'did', 'prove', 'ca', ""n't"", 'try', 'squeeze', 'comedy', 'horror', 'family', 'angst', 'sci-fi', 'drama', 'quirky', 'neighbors', 'oddball', 'pals', 'buddy', 'schisms', 'one', 'movie', 'had', 'picked', 'three', 'four', 'might', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'it.Next', 'pacing', 'just', 'fails', 'unnecessary', 'elements', 'discussed', 'movie', 'around', 'so', 'many', 'sub-plots', 'continually', 'own', 'mood', 'example', 'scary', 'alien', 'encounter', 'main', 'characters', 'spend', 'LOT', 'time', 'are', 'actually', 'mundane', 'uninteresting', 'family', 'issues', 'alien', 'story', 'next', 'dollop', 'attention.There', 'are', 'enough', 'other', 'problems', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'fair', 'pile', 'significant', 'violations', 'film', 'own', 'internal', 'logic', 'concerning', 'aliens.Last', 'not', 'least', 'Stiller', 'Vaughn', 'tried', 'hard', 'essentially', 'come', 'parodies', 'own', 'past', 'performances.It', 'sad', 'movie', 'was', 'close', 'hitting', 'target', 'was', 'just', 'enough', 'sync', 'never', 'capture', 'momentum', 'mood', 'did', 'flying', 'flaming', 'tiger', 'logos', 'Rosemarie', 'DeWitt', 'bustier']",The Watch

1479888,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAII2Q,Chris Kennison,"[0, 7]","""The Watch"" has been through numerous changes, rewrites, setbacks and problems throughout its history. In fact, the movies development began four years ago in 2008. It was supposed to be a ""Ghostbuster"" thingy. It was at one point supposed to star and be directed by Will Ferrell. Then it went without a Director for a long while. Finally Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg came in to rewrite and SNL's Akiva Schaffer came in to direct. Then the Trayvon Martin shooting happened, and the movie about a group of Neighorhood Watch men faced another challenge. The marketing scheme had to be dramatically changed.Based on all of these hurdles, ""The Watch"" is not a bad movie. It is gifted with some pretty good humor from the talents of Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Richard Ayoade and Jonah Hill. Ultimately though, the movie could have been so much better. The premise is outstanding. When Ben Stiller's character, Evan Trautwig, is greeted with a gruesome murder scene when he comes to his job at Cosco one morning, he decides to start a neighborhood watch team in order to save his beautiful, friendly and peaceful community. The band-of-misfits are clueless what they will eventually be up against.Despite three years of development though, the numerous collaborators either left out a lot of creative stuff, had to edit out a lot of creative stuff or overlooked the fact that their movie was in desperate need of something more unique. Too much of the movie relied upon the bitter-batter of its stars, which for the most part is funny, but gets old eventually. Enough time wasn't spent making ""The Watch"" something other than mediocre or run-of-the-mill.We will probably not know what all happened to ""The Watch"" in its long process or what it could have been, but its ultimate outcome is pretty disappointing. It's too bad though because the humor in the movie is very funny. The actors worked well together, but given the premise of the movie, it should have been so much more than it was.

And I say this as someone who likes the screen presence of Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn pretty much regardless of what the film is about.  But Stiller and Vaughn are not enough to save this film.  It's poorly written.  It's has a poor screen play.  It has a weird subplot about Ben Stiller's character being infertile that has nothing to do with anything else in the film and if I had to guess I would say it was only included in the film to setup Vaughn's character for a string of one liners about dead sperm.  And there are scene after extended scenes of the main characters just riffing on each other as if they shot these guys doing improv and then cobbled together the best insults from one of their sessions and edited them into the film.  It feels strained and staid the whole way through.  The plot is awful and barely thought through.  And by the way- this film might as well be a giant ad for Costco.  It really feels like this movie was paid for by a Costco marketing division.  And not a big thing- but I found it very distracting- was Stiller's makeup.  It looks like his face is covered in crust it is so thick.  I felt sorta cheated by this sloppy hackish production.  I expect better out of Stiller and Vaughn.The only way I could recommend this film is if you like Vince Vaughn enough to see him deliver some good one liners in a movie that otherwise is awful.

I have long been a huge fan of the UK comedy series The IT Crowd which Ayoade stars in. The man is a comic genius, and I didn't care what The Watch was about, I was just eager to see one of the funniest character actors I've seen in a long time in a mainstream picture.The film takes place in a cookie-cutter American suburb of Glenview, Ohio. Evan (Ben Stiller) is manager at the local Costco, who's overcompensates for his male insecurities by taking part in countless clubs and activities, anything but spending time with his hot wife Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt). Things get shaken up when Evan's friend and Costco security guard, Antonio (Joe Nunez), is suspiciously murdered one night in the store. Evan's solution is to create a new club: the Neighborhood Watch.Evan attracts only a few eager volunteers: Bob (Vince Vaughn), the man's man looking for some buddies to party with; Franklin (Jonah Hill), the police academy flunky; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade). the quirky and mysterious British lad. The group of misfits get off to a rough start with the watch, which mostly turns into an excuse for most of the guys to drink and get away from their personal troubles. Just as Evan loses hope for the group, they come across a curious lead whilst on patrol one night.The film then takes a rather unexpected turn. I'd say that turn is rather silly, but it really is on par with the whole movie leading up to it. From the opening scene I knew what I was in for with this film. The raunchy and idiotic comedy driven by sex, beer, racism and other standards of film's in its class is abundant. This genre isn't particularly my forte, but every now and then, one of these moronic comedies is a good change of pace to just let loose.The characters lack depth, we don't really care about them, and the story is so incredibly zany and silly that it feels like the everything is just drawn in with disregard for coherence. But honestly, that seems like exactly what they set out to do with this film. It's a silly comedy about a bunch of guys, each with their own issues, who wind up in a sci-fi plot. And to be honest, I laughed like crazy. As I said, every now and then it's good to just check your mind at the door. I was due for a nonsense comedy with a wild story and wacky characters, and The Watch delivered. And of course, Richard Ayoade is the icing on the cake with his signature brand of humor.Source: criticnic.com 27 December 2012",4,Funny raunchy sci-fi comedy,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,2573,"['was', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'knew', 'Watch', 'had', 'wanting', 'see', 'even', 'saw', 'trailer', 'was', 'Richard', 'Ayoade', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'UK', 'comedy', 'series', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'Ayoade', 'stars', 'man', 'comic', 'genius', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'Watch', 'was', 'was', 'just', 'eager', 'see', 'one', 'funniest', 'character', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'mainstream', 'picture.The', 'film', 'place', 'cookie-cutter', 'American', 'suburb', 'Glenview', 'Ohio', 'Evan', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'manager', 'local', 'Costco', 'who', 'overcompensates', 'male', 'insecurities', 'taking', 'part', 'countless', 'clubs', 'activities', 'anything', 'spending', 'time', 'hot', 'wife', 'Abby', 'Rosemarie', 'DeWitt', 'Things', 'get', 'shaken', 'up', 'when', 'Evan', 'friend', 'Costco', 'security', 'guard', 'Antonio', 'Joe', 'Nunez', 'suspiciously', 'murdered', 'one', 'night', 'store', 'Evan', 'solution', 'create', 'new', 'club', 'Neighborhood', 'Watch.Evan', 'only', 'few', 'eager', 'volunteers', 'Bob', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'man', 'man', 'looking', 'buddies', 'party', 'Franklin', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'police', 'academy', 'flunky', 'Jamarcus', 'Richard', 'Ayoade', 'quirky', 'mysterious', 'British', 'lad', 'group', 'misfits', 'get', 'rough', 'start', 'watch', 'mostly', 'excuse', 'most', 'guys', 'drink', 'get', 'away', 'personal', 'troubles', 'Just', 'Evan', 'hope', 'group', 'come', 'curious', 'lead', 'whilst', 'patrol', 'one', 'night.The', 'film', 'then', 'rather', 'unexpected', 'turn', ""'d"", 'say', 'turn', 'rather', 'silly', 'really', 'par', 'whole', 'movie', 'leading', 'up', 'opening', 'scene', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'film', 'raunchy', 'idiotic', 'comedy', 'driven', 'sex', 'beer', 'racism', 'other', 'standards', 'film', 'class', 'abundant', 'genre', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'forte', 'now', 'then', 'one', 'moronic', 'comedies', 'good', 'change', 'pace', 'just', 'let', 'loose.The', 'characters', 'lack', 'depth', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'story', 'so', 'incredibly', 'zany', 'silly', 'everything', 'just', 'drawn', 'disregard', 'coherence', 'honestly', 'exactly', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'film', 'silly', 'comedy', 'bunch', 'guys', 'own', 'issues', 'who', 'wind', 'up', 'sci-fi', 'plot', 'be', 'honest', 'laughed', 'crazy', 'said', 'now', 'then', 'good', 'just', 'check', 'mind', 'door', 'was', 'due', 'nonsense', 'comedy', 'wild', 'story', 'wacky', 'characters', 'Watch', 'delivered', 'course', 'Richard', 'Ayoade', 'icing', 'cake', 'signature', 'brand', 'humor.Source', 'criticnic.com', '27', 'December', '2012']",The Watch

Bob (Vince Vaughn) is that loud, obnoxious neighbor you love to hate. Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), shy and recently divorced, is looking for action (and, by action, I mean Asian women). Franklin (Jonah Hill), once an aspiring law enforcer, sees the group as a vigilante squad. This is maybe the most unprepared, most undedicated neighborhood watch ever. And in Glenview, Ohio, they may be all that stand between us and an alien invasion. We are so, so screwed. This is how Falling Skies and After Earth happen.So, a disclaimer: THE WATCH is more clown house than art house. It isn't something you want to watch in the tea parlor with your aunties and your scones. It's not for delicate ears. This movie is raunchy and crude and vulgar. It's best enjoyed when you put on your frat-boy hat and you've got your immature buddies around. At least the trailer prepped you for what sort of movie it is. I did appreciate that the story didn't minimize the danger of the invaders. These aliens aren't that well established but we note that they're wicked mean and pursue a habit of skinning their victims. The green goo is, of course, an expected by-product. The humor is a cross between Apatow and the Farrelly Brothers. I couldn't believe the crazy things these guys were saying and doing, but, with me, it was a case of shaking my head but laughing, too. The performances, what performances? While I laughed a lot, I couldn't help but view the members of the Watch as shallow cartoon characters. Stiller, Vaughn, and Hill tap into their trademark onscreen personas, so either you like their patented traits or you don't. Either you like Costco or you don't. Either you like exploding cows or you don't.The DVD's bonus stuff:- 12 Deleted/Extended Scenes (totaling 00:24:35 minutes)- Gag Reel (00:03:41)- ""Alien Invasions & You"" - cast & crew are asked what they would do if there's an alien invasion (00:01:47)- ""Casting the Alien"" - a tongue-in-cheek sit down interview with one of the aliens (00:05:24)- Theatrical Trailer",3,"""Somebody killed Antonio, okay.

Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller) is the senior manager of the local Costco store and he is involved in almost every community club in town. He should be as he is the person who started most of them. One evening his night watchman is brutally murdered at work.  Evan is outraged as the police seem to not be actively involved in finding the murderer and he starts a local neighborhood group called the Watch to keep an eye out over the neighborhoods to try to solve the murder and prevent other crimes.His group only attracts 3 other members who are Franklin (Jonah Hill), Bob (Vince Vaughn) and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade).  As Evan tries to organize this madcap group of misfits into a professional watch organization they uncover a sinister plot in Glenview to take over not only the city but the entire world....This movie is a hilarious comedy and my wife and I enjoyed it.  It does contain a lot of crude language and sexual content so it is not advisable for children and it is rated R. The storyline is a funny Sci-Fi twist where the Watch team is aware of aliens invading the city with a plot to do even more.  It is up to them to figure out what the plan is while also taking care of their own personal lives.  There are a lot of funny one line jokes but they are mingled in with many crude language comments that seem to detract to the story line.  (it was overdone)The cast of actors is very good and the talent of the stars carries the movie. The script is weak and depends too much of vulgar jokes instead of comedic innovation that such a powerful cast could have easily pulled off.  That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It is worth watching but I would probably rent it as I can't see someone watching it more than one time.  It is funny and has a lot of good parts in the movie.

1479984,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005LAII2Q,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 7]","The Watch (formerly titled Neighborhood Watch until the PC-police arrived) draws easy comparisons to Ghostbusters and it has the comedic energy; it just doesn't really go anywhere. It's been absolutely pummeled by critics but the typical audience in the movie's demographic will likely find something enjoyable about it. Despite a script co-written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, it would almost be a total failure without the comedic skill of Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, and Richard Ayoade. If you enjoy their comedic stylings, a line or two will please you but the laughs are underwhelming and often repetitive.In the small town of Glenview, Ohio, Evan (Stiller) is the senior manager of a local Costco store and an active member in his community. He's your typical overzealous suburbanite. One night a security guard at Costco is killed under mysterious circumstances and Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. He recruits only 3 people; loud and animated Bob (Vaughn), sociopathic Franklin (Hill), and inexplicably British Jamarcus (Ayoade). With Evan dedicating much of his energy to finding the killer he's angered by the other three using the watch as an outlet for camaraderie. Things change when the four find a mysterious orb...and the alien(s) who brought it here.The Watch is rated `R' largely due to the vulgar humor that's in the same vein as Superbad, The Sitter, and the average Apatow-clan movie. This humor occurs in the context of a sci-fi action film, with a level of alien-related violence a step above the Men in Black series. The premise isn't very fresh, but it's one where you can snugly fit a solid cast and situational humor that the script ultimately fails to deliver. The script is essentially a series of humorless events that give the actors a chance to improvise humorous dialogue, with an unnecessary subplot involving a character's impotence that brings nothing to the movie.When The Watch works, it's often in small increments. The humor is far from high-brow (the scene that made me laugh the most is about as far from that term as you can get), but that isn't the problem. I don't need jokes that will change my life; I just need jokes that will make me laugh consistently. I laughed a few times, but only sporadically and the only reason I remained consistently amused was the natural ability of the principal cast. The filmmakers owe all the success and humor to them.One of the funniest moments is R. Lee Ermey's appearance as an irate man who confronts the neighborhood watch. The uncredited Billy Crudup also amuses as Evan's creepy neighbor who the watch suspects may be an alien. I've always found Vaughn's deadpan and caffeinated ranting funny and he provided some of my favorite comedic moments. There's a sequence where the guys have taken a dead alien back to Vaughn's house and begin taking pictures with it (many of them inappropriate). There's nothing original about this scene, but it's so ludicrous and the four actors work so well together I couldn't help but laugh.I admit to some bias. Because I like Vaughn, Hill, and Stiller it may be easier for me to find enjoyment in this than the average viewer. Vaughn has the ability to stare directly into the camera and make me laugh. However, with the talent present here, this movie should have been much better. It was never a movie looking for critical accolades; it's just supposed to be a dumb, funny movie. Unfortunately it's dumb more than it's funny. Many will greet The Watch with enthusiasm and declarations of ""the critics are stupid!"" Many will greet it with an open-mind, hate it, and take out their hatred on the IMDB message boards with jokes about Jonah Hill's physique.

Proceed with caution.I've never been a huge fan of Ben Stiller, but I love Jonah Hill and I find Vince Vaughn to be oddly entertaining. So with this movie I wasn't really sure what to expect. I wasn't setting the bar too high. All I really wanted was to enjoy myself and that's what the end result was. From start to finish I was laughing and just having a good time.After watching this I feel safe in saying that this is 100% a dude film. There's a lot of comedy, there's aliens, there's action, a couple of breasts thrown in there. It's a good time. I wasn't really expecting the story to involve aliens, but it ended up working out. Ben Stiller gave a normal Ben Stiller performance, it wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill on the other hand... wow! These two were hilarious in here! Then there's Richard Ayoade, someone I've never heard of prior to watching this, who gave a surprisingly good performance.What this film does well is embrace the fact that it's weird. I was expecting it to be a group of friends that were forced into doing this neighborhood watch, but it's the complete opposite. You have Evan Trautwig (Stiller) who wants to start the watch after someone is murdered. So he tries to get people interested enough to sign up. However, the only three people who show up are Bob McAllister (Vaughn), Franklin (Hill), and Jamarcus (Ayoade). Bob wants to join because he thinks it's going to be a group of guys getting together to hang out and get away from their wives, Franklin is just messed up in the head and wants to take out his frustration, and Jamarcus is someone who is recently divorced that wants to make some new friends. I recently read that Chris Rock was originally planned for Jamarcus, that would've been amazing! Sadly, it didn't happen. Either way these four have great chemistry on screen which makes for a very entertaining experience.Overall Score: 8/10 - This film is far from perfect, and it can be corny at times, but in the end it's a good time.

Brand placement in film has reached annoying levels (2) The Watch contains mawkish subplots that have no business being in a sci-fi comedy. For example, Vaughn's character is trying to better connect with his daughter, while Stiller has breeding issues with his wife. It's like the miniseries V  intersecting with Thirtysomething.

The previews of the movie show Bob(Pub)as hysterical character, behaving childishly and improperly, Evan as a shallow character with hunched back and wasted physique, Jemarks as an outfit playing on the edge of the scenario, and Frank in his usual role of soft underachieving adult. My first impression from the previews was that the four main characters should have not gotten into a common theme when each of them lacked the gravitas of keeping the theme alive throughout its hour and half.In reality, Pub (Bob) turned out the brightest star with his natural, spontaneous performance. Even though Evan started the scenario with his Costco's job responsibilities, it took a while before Evan could grasp the affection of the viewer. Evan's character was very smartly thought, a stiff straight simple man with perfectionist views on life whose personality was the perfect contrast of Pub.Franklin who also adopted the roles of immature, soft male was lifted fittingly by Pub's outstanding warm performance.Two noticeable outcomes of The Neighborhood Watch should be stated. First, Pub's spontaneous use of profane expressions was dangerously innocuous as it mixed profanity with natural reaction and with highly intellectual arguments that renders profanity an acceptable tool of communication. Pub rebukes Evan"" ""How is like to be a party of one?"", among few other sane arguments expressed with formidable facial and bodily motions that sooth the reaction to Pub's arguments.Secondly, Costco entered history by its promotion of a story implying that aliens could not find any better place to build their spaceship than Costco's everything in one place.

It's sunny, the people are friendly and don't even get me started on all of the activities. SO MANY ACTIVITIES! And guess what else? There's a Costco. Yep, a geniune Costco! I love Costco and coincidentally so does the Store Manager, Evan. Glenview is near perfect, well, it is until Costco's trusty night watchman ends up brutally murdered. Evan doesn't take kindly to murderers killing off his staff and defiling his store, so he does what any rational human being would do in this situation--he forms a neighborhood watch. The watch consisting of Evan, Bob, Franklin and Jamarcus make it their mission solve Antonio's murder. But soon several more of Glenview's trusty residents go missing and all evidence points to aliens as the culprit. With these four eclectic suburbanites as Glenview's only remaining hope, is everyone doomed to succumb to the pending invasion?With regard to The Watch, you're far better off reading my excellent summary than purchasing it. At least I managed to make it sound somewhat entertaining, right? Okay, perhaps I'm embellishing the terriblness of the flick just a little, but it really is bad. Lucky for me, my expectations radar was set to tickle rather than stun, so I didn't have to worry about disappointment or anything. So, yeah, that's a plus. This is yet another one of those not-funny-movies that has marginally funny people in it. You have Vince Vaughn being a total jerk (basically himself), Jonah Hill doing a pitiful portrayal of a bad boy and Ben Stiller doing the""I'm a nice guy who inadvertently gets caught up in crazy hijinks"" thing. SNOOZE. The real people to watch are Will Forte and the rest of the supporting cast. And I can't forget Richard Ayoade. He's hilarious. In fact, watch Flight of the Concords, it's so much better. Okay, back to the movie. Unsurprisingly, it's a total raunchfest, and honestly, I've seen one too many of those lately.The utter ridiculousness isn't the only thing that had me smacking my head on the table. They dangle this tantalizing science fictiony ""we are already among you, living as you"" carrot in front of you and THEY TOOK IT NOWHERE! Yeah. Basically all of the potentially decent sci-fi stuff was a total red herring. GAH! Here's an idea. Let ME remake the movie. I'm being serious! And look movie producer guys, I'll make this easy for you. We don't have to recast any of it. That's right, we'll keep all the same actors. Just let me put those super exposive ray gun thingys to better use and bring the tone down to the likes of The Faculty or Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Now we've got ourselves a real movie! What do you say? You better act soon! My services are running at a discount (which I attribute solely to the holiday spirit). Have we got a deal?Food for Thought: The Watch, as a sci-fi film, is just what you'd expect: unremarkable. As a comedy it's sparse and spotty, relying more on the street cred of the comedic actors in it than on the actual comedy itself. There are, however far and few between, funny moments thanks mostly in part to Richard Ayoade and Will Forte.

So, don't watch it at the next family get together, with that special someone you just met, your kids or your grandparents.It is a GUY movie. It is a Buddy Movie packed with some sci fi/horror/action elements. It is extremely well acted and executed. It has a nice budget behind the special effects and the aliens. It is kinda weird in parts, and down-right disgusting in others.Apparently, a lot of folks couldn't get past some of the more squeamishly homo innuendos and focus on the male genitalia. I don't know what others have been watching, but this is par for the course in this genre. From Adam Sandler and Kevin James, to Harold and Kumar, to Pineapple Express and Hangover ---Hollywood likes to make it's pro-homosexual point. And it like to get laughs with very base, gutter, and toilet humor.Frankly, I found ""Harold and Kumar Go to Gitmo"" much more ""offensive"" than this movie. And ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" was way over the top. These movies are made to appeal to older teens and college kids who laugh at certain words being said on TV or in a movie, even if it's Buddy addressing Dick Van Dyke on the old TV comedy.While this kind of college humor is not appealing to me, I did find a lot to laugh at.

It is also tasteless in it's approach to humor and  how it handles it's violence, it is just down right one of the least pleasurable experiences that you are bound to have this year. Already known for it's last minute title change from ""Neighborhood Watch"", to avoid connections in audiences minds with the recent Trayvon Martin shooting. This movie could have been a welcomed timed comment on the violent nature and the dumbing down of society, but instead it is a whole hog embracing of it.Ben Stiller stars as Evan, your average Costco employee, this is an embarrassing movie long advert for the chain store, who forms a local neighborhood watch after the mysterious death of a friend. He recruits pals Bob (Vince Vaughn) and Franklin (Jonah Hill), and newcomer Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade). Together they discover the problem isn't local gangs, vandals or sex-crazed neighbors, but a full scale alien invasion.Stiller plays his usual tightly wound character here, a character that is becoming annoying and loosing much interest. Still, Stiller fares better than co-stars Vaughan who's persona has never been  more obnoxious than it is here and the usually reliable Hill as a gun totting misfit/loser/reject is more than a bit creepy.Written by Seth Rogen (who wisely does not appear in the film, not even an unbilled cameo!) along with Jared Stern and Evan Goldberg, this mix of sophomoric humor and straight foreword alien terror fails miserably at every step. Usually, I'm all over horror-comedy mesh-ups, especially when the frights are played straight as they are here. However, the attempted gross out humor is just not funny, it's aimed at the ten or twelve year-old boy level.

Unfortunately not many people show up to join the group and all have their own reasons and issues.Evan- Costco manager. Very straight and needs to be in charge. Takes things seriously, but doesn't take care of business with his wife (Rosemarie DeWitt).Bob- (Vince Vaughn) Likes to drink and share his man-cave with his friends. Has a teenage daughter (Erin Moriarty) he keeps his eye on.Franklin- (slimmed down Jonah Hill) Has the best lines. He quit school to become a policeman. He failed the written exam, physical, and the mental health screening. Wants to be a vigilante. Lives at home with his mother. Couldn't help think about George Zimmerman and Richard Jewel.Jamarcus- (Richard Ayoade) He is from England and has a Korean girl fantasy.The four guys are considered a joke. When they discover the aliens, they get up for the task.I loved the use of the classic rock sound track which included The Doors, J. Geils Band, and Chris Cross who provided a laugh as the phone tone for the salty R. Lee Ermey. The humor rolls with the lines like when Bob asks Franklin, ""You failed the police exam, is this illegal?""There was a lot of good humor.

He starts a Neighborhood Watch, enlisting Bob (Vince Vaughn), who just wants to get out of the house; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a rejected applicant for the local police force; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a frizzy-haired guy of vague ethnicity.""The Watch"" fails in its predictable, awkward attempt to blend assorted genres into a laugh riot.  The script by Seth Rogen, Jared Stern, and Evan Goldberg is a fruitless attempt to milk gags from an idea that might have looked better on paper than it does on screen.  Director Akiva Schaffer is adrift in trying to bring that script to comic life, with many scenes looking amateurish.Stiller's blank look is supposed to get laughs, but he comes off as rigid and unamusing.  A subplot involving his sexual difficulties with his wife, Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt), might account for his disengaged demeanor, but hardly generates laughter.Hill recycles his nerdy shnook character from many earlier films and struggles to be funny, but is fighting the sub-par script, while Ayoade attempts to get laughs from describing his character's sexual fantasies.  Vaughn carries most of the comedy weight in ""The Watch.""  His rapid-fire delivery, childlike suggestions, and innocent desire to have fun with the boys are honest and believable.  Even when the script isn't there to support him, he manages to forge ahead, substituting body language, facial expression, and that rat-tat-tat delivery for clever dialogue.The final third of the movie is filled with CGI special effects.  These days, viewers take for granted the marvels of computer-generated imagery, so creepy, slimy, fast-moving ET's that ooze green blood aren't enough to salvage this pedestrian effort.The three-disc Combo Pack contains Blu-ray and DVD versions, deleted scenes, gag reel, digital copy, and several featurettes.

Sparking little interest, he only attracts 3 others: Bob (Vince Vaughn) who wants to hang out with a couple of guys watching football and eating wings, Franklin (Jonah Hill), who overcompensates by trying to be rough and tough, and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade) a British fellow who wants to use the Watch to attract women.They discover that the murder is part of a plot of aliens who are going to try to take over the world by sending a signal from Costco, and must overcome the dastardly villains.Unfortunately this film is highly disappointing.  If you have seen the trailer, you have seen most of the funny parts already, and you know about the aliens (who actually don't make any sort appearance or even mention until over halfway through this film).  There are a few other surprises and over the top funny parts, but really nothing to speak of.  The characters are pretty unlikeable, and even the campiness mentioned doesn't bring much fun.

Sweeney,"[0, 0]","When the night security man at the Glenview, Ohio Costco store is brutally murdered and the investigating sheriff proves to be an idiot, the store manager organizes a neighborhood watch to go after the murderer. Serious-sounding, but from there it degenerates in a pleasant enough comedy as only three people respond to his call and none of them really want to be wandering around at night surveilling anything except beer bottles, TV, and women.  When they come face-to-face with the killer and it turns out to be an alien, attitudes changes mightily.  When it's discovered the aliens are headquarters in the Costco basement, it turns frantic. This is a funny movie. It's also rude, raucous and  full of sexual innuendos and shocking vulgarities, an overabundance where one or two would really suffice.  The characters themselves are irritating but still likable and their actions as they &#34;save the day&#34; and their town put them in the reluctant hero category. There are surprises in store, as the people they believed to be aliens turn out to be something more surprising and those which the viewer may guess are, turn out to be. Woven into the plot is enough of each man's story to keep him interesting without it overpowering the main idea.  I was glad to see this didn't follow the usual cliched outline and had a few twists and turns along the way. There are a few fatalities but nothing shown onscreen except the demise of the alien which is overkill bordering on the ridiculous.

Would you risk your life defending it?Evan Trautwig (played by Ben Stiller) is the most civic-minded member of his hometown of Glenview, OH. As a member of most local community organizations and founder of several, Evan (Stiller) somehow manages to balance all that, a wife, and a job managing the local Costco. When the night watchman, his friend, is murdered, he then starts the one community organization that his town surprisingly does not have: a neighborhood watch. Despite posting signs all over Glenview to alert the citizenry of their first meeting, only three men show up. Bob Finnerty, father and construction worker, Franklin, who had hoped to join the police but was rejected, and Jamarcus who is recently divorced. Finnerty (played by Vince Vaughn) shows no interest in safeguarding the community and uses the watch as an excuse to get out of the house. Franklin (played by Jonah Hill) sees the watch as an opportunity to show up those on the police force who rejected him and engage in acts of vigilantism. Jamarcus (played by Richard Ayoade) is simply looking to meet people while entertaining the possibility that a lonely, attractive, housewife might call the watch for assistance and seduce him. Whatever their differences, they're all shocked when they discover the violent attack that inspired Trautwig to found the watch was perpetrated by aliens.I've said it before; I'm not a fan of Ben Stiller. Almost all of his movies are exactly the same. That's only become clearer since he decided the Meet the Parents franchise needed a third, even more ridiculous, installment.
