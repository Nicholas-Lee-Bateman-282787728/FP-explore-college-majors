1289125,A3T8Y73DOFUIR6,B002TZS588,,"[0, 0]","Awful movie.  An older woman gets together with a younger guy who has beaten up his wife so badly she was in the hospital for two weeks.  When he drinks he becomes violent.  Her other alternative is her husband, who is a pompous ass but who at least hasn't put anyone in the hospital.  I hate romantic comedies where you don't want the leads to get together.  I really did not want Matty, the heroine, to get together with this guy who was violent and could easily kill her or one of her three kids in a fit a rage. Do not understand why anyone would think this is a good movie.  Would've been better if she left both of them, like in Bed and Sofa.  There's a great foreign film about a love triangle.",1,I hate romantic comedies where you don't want the leads to ...,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,701,"['Awful', 'movie', 'older', 'woman', 'together', 'younger', 'guy', 'who', 'beaten', 'up', 'wife', 'so', 'badly', 'was', 'hospital', 'two', 'weeks', 'When', 'violent', 'other', 'alternative', 'husband', 'who', 'pompous', 'ass', 'who', 'least', ""n't"", 'put', 'anyone', 'hospital', 'hate', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'leads', 'get', 'together', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'Matty', 'heroine', 'get', 'together', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'violent', 'could', 'easily', 'kill', 'one', 'three', 'kids', 'fit', 'rage', 'Do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'Would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'left', 'Bed', 'Sofa', 'great', 'foreign', 'film', 'love', 'triangle']",N/A

Her husband has left her and their three kids for one of his students.  She keeps hoping he will come to his senses and return, but in the meantime she (literally) runs into a truck driver (well, into his truck) who brings a smile back to her face.

I had heard great things about this movie through various Belgian connections, but had never had a chance to see it, until now.""Moscow, Belgium"" (106 min.; originally released in 2009) brings the daily struggles of a 41 yr. old woman, Matty, whose husband has moved out due to a fling with a 22 yr. former student. Matty meets Johnny as a result of a car accident in a parking lot, and unexpectedly takes a liking to this much younger man (29 yrs). Things develop from there. Not much really happens, other than to observe the characters in their daily life, and this is not a complaint, mind ya. Matty tries to handle her 3 kids and her husband, while at the same trying to figure out if much younger Johnny, who has himself some skelletons from the past, can really be the one for her. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.In all, I was incredibly pleased with this movie, and yes proud (being from Belgium). Who would've thunk it that such a great movie could've been made in Belgium? Special shout-out to Barbara Sarafian as Matty and Anemone Valcke a her 17 yr. old daughter, both of whom bring fantastic performances. This movie picked up a bunch of awards at various fims festivals (including Cannes), and for good reason.

Who wants to see a film set in a tacky suburb of Ghent?  So....what a great surprise!  The cast is first rate.  Top of the list is Barbara Sarafian, as Matty, a 41 year old stressed out mother of three.  She gives the finest, most realistic and heartwatming performance I've seen by a woman in a long time.  She could give Meryle Streep a run for the money.  A young girl with the lovely name of Anemone Valcke, plays her 16 year old daughter and she is absolutely pitch-perfect in the role, too.  The others are all very good too.The story set up could lead to another formulaic rom-com, the kind we've seen too many of in the US. Underappreciated wife is dumped by her art teacher husband for one of his very young students.  Wife runs into, literally, a big, dumb looking, sweaty truck driver who has an anger management problem.  It's not love at first sight.  I won't ruin the fun for you by telling you what happens.  Here it is so well done that it holds your interest to the end.
