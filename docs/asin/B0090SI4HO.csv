1580505,AHNT97DWEAQUY,B0090SI4HO,"Amazon Customer ""buriedatlantis""","[3, 4]","Arnold is finally back in a starring vehicle for the first time since Terminator 3.  Sure, he popped up in the Expendables flicks, but those weren't headliners for him.  There was a lot of years of anticipation for the Arnold fan of whether or not this movie could possibly live up to those kind of expectations.I will say this, The Last Stand is not a bad movie.  Neither is it a particularly great movie.  I would say it's a middle of the road Arnold movie, but nothing like what we expected and usually got out of the man in his heyday.  To be fair, and it pains me to say this about the icon, but his heyday has passed.  So, in all honesty, this is the type of movie we should expect from him.We tend to forget that before Arnold went off to play politics in the state of California, other than Terminator 3, his movies were no longer banking like they used to.  I feel The Last Stand is certainly better than some of those movies he was making before T3; you know, your Collateral Damages, your End of Days or Jingle All the Ways.  Every single one of those movies I saw in the theater, and this one I didn't.  Go figure.A few things that I really dug about the movie.  It doesn't try to be a slam bang, over the top 100 million dollar budget blockbuster from Arnold's past.  It's a relatively medium budgeted movie with a simple plot with Arnold playing his age.  Sure, they try to throw in a few Arnold-esqe one liners, but it's so not that type of movie.  There's a couple of nice action scenes in the first hour or so, one in which Arnie has to save his deputies that's pretty cool, but most of the good stuff is saved for the last half hour, when we see the titular last stand.  There's a few tense moments, and the deputies get some good digs in at the bad guys.  I feel Arnold is very good in the last half hour of the movie, despite his age.  I thoroughly enjoyed Arnie and his deputies squaring off against the drug lord and his cronies at the end.Unfortunately, the first hour leading up to that feels a bit ho-hum and drags a bit.  I could of used a bit more last stand in The Last Stand.  This time of the movie is a lot of Forest Whitaker huffing and puffing and not really doing much of anything other than lending his name to the movie while Arnold doesn't have much to do other than act.  Let us be honest with ourselves, even as fans, this is not his greatest asset in the world of film.  Breaking bad guys' faces is.Still, it's a credit to director Kim Jee-Woon that even during the first hour of set up for the much better last half hour that he manages to move the proceedings along at a brisk enough pace that you don't catch yourself watching the clock.No way is this a bad movie at all, but it's certainly not iconic, like the Arnold greats of past.

1580600,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B0090SI4HO,Chris Kennison,"[2, 3]","After a stint as Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger has returned in his first lead role as an actor. With his life full of scandal and his ability to win back an audience in question, Arnold certainly reminds me of why he was such a successful movie star in the first place. He may (I take that back). He will never win an Oscar in his life, although I think Schwarzenegger's future as an actor is well in tact for one simple reason. He is oozing with charisma.I was reminded of this after watching the charisma-challenged Colin Farrell step into his shoes in ""Total Recall"" earlier this year. Regardless of what you think of Arnold Schwarzenegger, he shines on screen when it comes to bringing you, the audience, into his films and making you care about him and the others around him. Apparently Hollywood thinks the same because including ""The Last Stand"" he has eight movies in the works through 2014.""Last Stand"" takes place in a small, nothing ever happens here, Arizona border town with probably too many police officers; four. Schwarzenegger plays Ray Owens, a former Los Angeles police officer who came to Arizona to get away from the relentless chaos and trials of big city police work. His fellow officers are just the opposite. They are either not prepared for such police work or eager for such police work. So when a ruthless Mexican drug kingpin escapes from FBI custody and begins hurtling their way in a specially outfitted car that is capable of going 200 MPH, they are about to get more trouble then they bargained for.""Last Stand"", along with Schwarzenegger, reminds me of how long it has been since a great action movie has been made. We've had action movies, but very few are worthy of repeat viewing or five-years from now we'll still be watching it. ""The Last Stand"" may just be one of those movies. The humor is plentiful and the personality is rich. The story is quality enough and the action never exceeds a level of reality or even comes close to a level of absurdity that we normally see in action movies these days. The movie is well filmed and has a level of coolness that puts it over the top.The only thing I would criticize about ""The Last Stand"" would be a fairly uncreative collision of bad guy and good guy in the middle of town. Where most of the movie was creative and had numerous moments that led the audience to believe that the officers of this tiny town were pretty much doomed. The cartel finally just show up in town, line up across the street (I think there were 9) and declare everybody dead. The movie, as creative as it was, could have done better.This one criticism is a pretty small detail in a movie that otherwise was a smashing success of entertainment, action and comedy. ""The Last Stand"" is a throwback to when action movies were good. There was a time when action movies didn't rely on absurd stunts that cross into fantasyland or had herky-jerky MTV editing that disguised how poorly the scenes are choreographed or assumed that the audience was only interested in 100-minutes of bullets zipping.

I just made that up of course, there is not such category but there ought to be. I believe Redbox is hitting my dopamine receptors a little too precisely, like a gambling machine I can't stay away from really great to really bad movies, all of which have passed my retina in the name of self-enlightenment or entertainment.This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it's right up there with AI and Madonnna's Swept Away. Some great actors starred, like the truly divine Forrest Whitaker, and for what he's worth, that Austrian dude whose name I can't spell right now but who rocked in all the Terminator movies.This is not an action flick in the likes of Vin Diesel, Milla Jovovich or Jason Statham (can't think of any black action heroes right now, weird. That bothers me a lot. Which black actor is on par with Vin Diesel and Jason Statham? Will Smith? Maybe. But when we think of franchises like the ones Tom Cruise or Matt Damon star in, only Lawrence Fishburn comes to mind and gorgeous Jamie Foxx, who should have a franchise like Terminator, Iron Man or the Fast and the Furious.This is action driven, humorless drab, and it's unfortunate because plot is equally important as new tricks (I refer back to Jason Statham, who supersedes stunts with every movie he does, and keeps thinking of innovative ways to brutally beat up his opponents). An example of an amazing action flick with incredible stunts, dialogue, plot and humor was ""Get the Gringo"" with Mel Gibson. Thank you, Redbox, that was a hit.Get the GringoI only watched this because it was filmed here in NM and it doesn't hurt to see how our tax dollars keep Hollywood at work. Unfortunately from the get go it was one lame action sequence after the other, dimensionless acting, Forrest was greatly underutilized, and again, no humor. And what's up with all the head shots?! Yes, every single bullet fired caused exploding heads. A little overdone, don't you think, Special F/X department and Director?The only good thing about ""The Last Stand"" was a stack of Reason magazines on the couch, and with my cat sleeping in my lap I spend a wonderful afternoon.

1580631,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0090SI4HO,DanD,"[1, 1]","The story is wonderfully preposterous: a cartel drug lord escapes the clutches of an over-serious Forest Whitacker.  He then kidnaps a female agent and takes off south in a souped-up sports car that can outrun a helicopter.  Naturally, the entire Federal Bureau of Investigation doesn't stand a chance against him.  Who does?  One old sheriff in a small border town, teaming up with some local misfits (including, for some reason, Johnny Knoxville, as well as Luis Guzman wielding an impressive broadsword, which is kinda cool actually).There was so much promise in THE LAST STAND.  It had all the trappings of the old Schwarzenegger classics: stalwart hero whose honor is impeccable; a nice array of supporting characters who get a bit too much screen time, but it's okay because they're weird; a deliciously evil villain (Peter Stormare, who's actually the second-in-command, but that just means he gets more screen time than his boss); and a relatively short running time that kind of crawls along at first, but picks up in the third act.  And, of course, there's Arnold himself, as charismatic as ever.  He doesn't get quite as many one-liners (the film is way too serious for its own good; more on that in a moment), but he's surprisingly still game.  Politics may have slowed the big guy down a bit, but that just means he takes his time before opening up a can of whoop-butt.So why only three stars, you ask?  Because director Kim Jee-Woon has taken a simple American action film and tried to stylize it like an Asian action film.  Don't get me wrong; the new wave of Asian/European action films are fantastic, and certainly deserve their place in cinema.  But that style doesn't mesh well with a Schwarzenegger film.  And make no mistake: from the terrible script to the predictable twists and turns, this is a Schwarzenegger action vehicle (the same kind that also sometimes stars Stallone, Van Damme, and, once upon a time, Seagal).  We expect violence, but we expect it toned down; kids find their way into Arnold films after all (I devoured all of them before the age of 12).  We don't expect artful sprays of blood and dismemberment; bouncing body parts do not belong in this type of film.  As for the tone...the film is WAY too serious.  Again, that springs from it trying to be too much...or, rather, from Jee-Woon trying to make too much out of it.  THE LAST STAND wasn't meant to be artful; it was meant to be fun.  It still is, in spots, but alas...it's a welcome return for Schwarzenegger, who probably doesn't have many years of doing this left to him.

""The Last Stand"" has a cartel boss (Edward Noriega) staging a spectularly good escape from federal custody in Las Vegas and high-tailing it for the Mexican border in a hot car with an FBI agent as hostage.  Schwarzenegger is the sheriff of the small Arizona town on the border where the cartel boss plans to cross into Mexico, with a few of his thugs clearing the way.  The premise is a nice setup for lots of car chases, gunfights, one-liners, and some redemptive behavior for the good guys in the small town.Sommerton Junction happens to be half-empty, with the mayor, the football team, and most of the citizen out of town for a big game.  Sheriff Ray Own, former LAPD police officer, is in charge and expecting a quiet weekend.  Not so much; first a gang of gun-toting mercenaries murder a farmer, then they shoot up a police car.  Owens soon learns what the FBI already knows, that the cartel boss is headed for Sommerton Junction, and help will not get there in time.  Owen rallies his deputes and the remaining townspeople for a last stand.The plot is pretty flimsy, but the action keeps the movie moving fast enough to make it all work.  Luis Guzman and Jaimie Alexander are good as Owen's plucky deputies, and Forest Whitaker almost steals the movie as a frustrated FBI agent.  There's a good car chase through a cornfield, and a great mano-a-mano confrontation on a bridge.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","I know I can't be the first person to associate Kim Jee-Woon's amazingly tepid THE LAST STAND with late 80's / early 90's action cinema, can I?  This flick feels like it must've gathered dust for at least three decades without anyone so much as picking it up and offering a simple rewrite.  Why Arnold Schwarzenegger would choose this project as his `comeback from retirement' picture is a complete loss to me unless he wanted to remind his audience of what better he'd already done in COMMANDO, RAW DEAL, and ERASER.  What could make the argument that those films are equally forgettable, but, in the very least, that had enough spark to capture the limelight by being in the right time at the right place.  By comparison, THE LAST STAND feels like it may've birthed itself from some scripts rejected from TV's ""The A Team"" and ""The Dukes of Hazzard.""(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Sheriff Ray Owens (played by legendary action star Arnold Schwarzenegger) is an aging lawman spending the last days of his career in the quiet li'l burg known as Sommerton Junction, a sleepy AZ border town.  However, the murder of a local resident kicks Owens and his three deputies into investigating what interest a Mexican cartel drug lord, Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega), may have with the city.  It turns out Cortez - escaped and on-the-run from the FBI - intends to cross back into his native country via Sommerton's lazy acres ... but he won't if the sheriff and his posse have anything to say about it!Now, to be fair, the description above actually details a story that I would've liked to have seen for THE LAST STAND; the problem is that so very much of the actual narrative feels constructed out of hackneyed drama and cookie-cutter characters that the film ends up almost entirely devoid of any impact.For his part, Schwarzenegger does the best he can with the material - a weak script watered down by background being ""said"" instead of either ""explored"" or ""learned"" naturally - but even he with all of his projected gravitas couldn't save this.  Instead, he's shackled with characters who probably couldn't pass an officer's exam even under duress - Luis Guzman as Deputy Mike `Figgy' Figueroa is only given comic relief lines; a usually reliable Jaimie Alexander is reduced to near damsel-in-distress status as Deputy Sarah Torrance; and (dear God) Johnny Knoxville as whacked-out-of-his-gord local resident Lewis Dinkum, a gun magnet with a penchant for naming inanimate objects.  Together, this team delivers one predictable line after another in a script that never quite develops beyond its hunt-and-shoot origins.What's even more frustrating is that the director - Kim Jee-Woon - has a fairly solid and significant track record in his native South Korea.  All too often, he gets pegged as a ""visionary,"" but, for my tastes, I think he delivers films that look good but do occasionally feel a bit derivative; this isn't a bad thing, per se, it's just that I'd like to see him branch out a bit more creatively with some other influences.  His THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE WEIRD is a terrific homage to the spaghetti westerns of old, but it too isn't without a few narrative hiccups.  (Stylistically, it's accomplished and brilliant.)  His I SAW THE DEVIL is a solid slasher flick but ends up relying a bit too heavily on blood, gore, and shock value to be anything greater than a comparison to earlier (Korean) revenge works with stronger characters.  Perhaps his best film - for my tastes - is A BITTERSWEET LIFE, the bittersweet story of a gangster who does something upright and correct only to find himself now on the outs with the mob.  Granted, that film could also be compared to other Korean crime thrillers, but it still is one of the only pictures with Kim's name on it that I feel was truly `complete' so far as the characters, the story, and the themes are concerned.Perhaps THE LAST STAND will end up being little more than a speed bump in his (and Arnold's) careers.  I certainly hope so.  I think better things are yet to come from both of them ... but I'll never quite understand what attracted either of them to such a routine action romp as this.THE LAST STAND is produced by Di Bonaventura Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled through Lionsgate.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  I don't know what anyone was thinking when they put this one together.  THE LAST STAND feels like it's a script that sat in some exec's desk drawer for 30 years, and once Arnold Schwarzenegger's name got attached to it suddenly everyone wanted to be a part of it.  Unfortunately, the plot is borderline ridiculous, and the performances are pretty much a waste of celluloid.  Johnny Knoxville?  Someone actually thought that was a good idea?  Please.

It's a good thing we live in a day and age where movies get a second chance in a home entertainment environment. All the people who dismissed it the first time can see what they missed out on.Ex-LAPD officer Ray Owens (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has retired to the small border town of Sommerton Junction. He's taken the position of sheriff in the quiet community. Things get heated up when Ray discovers the leader of a drug cartel, Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega), is heading through the heart of Sommerton Junction as he speeds toward Mexico and freedom. It's up to Owens and his inexperienced deputies to stop Cortez and his gang as they prepare for a daring escape across the border.Frankly, ""The Last Stand"" is the perfect vehicle for Schwarzenegger to make his comeback in. it's not an overhyped blockbuster or giant summer action film like a new ""Terminator"" would be. It's a more personal and low-profile affair which basically has the actor playing himself. He's getting older but doesn't want to give up on the adrenaline rush of actively working and doing something physically challenging. Schwarzenegger is the type of guy that knows it's almost time to start winding down but fights it tooth and nail.If you spent the bulk of the past decade mourning the loss of the 1980s and 1990s action films you grew up on, ""The Last Stand"" will fill that void in your heart. It's packed with that good old-fashioned violence, blood, and gore the politically correct will run from in herds. This is classic Schwarzenegger wrapped up in a new package.The high-definition transfer for ""The Last Stand"" presents a crystal clear picture and great 7.1 surround sound. However, the clarity doesn't distract from the gritty quality of the movie. Every blast of a gun, explosion, and crunching sound of someone getting hit blares out at the audience.A nice amount of special features are included in the Blu-ray release of ""The Last Stand."" There are three behind-the-scenes featurettes entitled ""Not In My Town: Making 'The Last Stand', ""Cornfield Chaos: Scene Breakdown,"" and ""The Dinkum Firearm & Historic Weaponry Museum Tour."" Deleted and extended scenes are also included. Johnny Knoxville and Jaimie Alexander provide first person ""Actor-Cam Anarchy"" as well.""The Last Stand"" may not be an innovative action flick that will change the way we look at the genre. it never made any promises to do so. What it does do is put Arnold Schwarzenegger back where he belongs. He's back in power as the king of action heroes.

However, during that ten year span, Arnold did make several cameo appearances in various films, all while running the state of California as governor.  Since leaving office in 2011, he's had a rough couple of years in his personal life.  But, like many celebrities, he used the publicity to his advantage and now continues on with his career.  With his career in politics over, Arnold is jumping back on to the big screen, starting with the action-packed film, The Last Stand.In The Last Stand, Arnold stars as Sheriff Ray Owens, a small town sheriff trying to catch an escaped Mexican drug kingpin, Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega).  Owens, assisted by his deputies, Frank (Rodrigo Santoro), Jerry (Zach Gilford), and Sarah (Jaimie Alexander) - and their crazy gun-toting friend Lewis (Johnny Knoxville), this small town police force is on a mission to stop this dangerous kingpin from crossing back into Mexico.  Forest Whitaker and Genesis Rodriguez also star in supporting roles as FBI agents.Like so many of Arnold's films, there's very little that stands out about this film.  It is - by all definitions - a violent action film with very little substance or goals other than to shoot a lot of guns and blow things up.  Even though it's nothing new for Arnold, it's great to see him back in the saddle.  Granted, he's never been the perfect actor, but he's never really strives to be.  He has always brought a certain comedic charm, along with gun shells and explosives, that's still very enjoyable to watch.  Add in stuntman Johnny Knoxville as a sidekick for sporadic moments of cheesy, slapstick humor and it makes for a great deal of onscreen fun.There's not a whole lot to be dissected in this film.  It's just another recycled storyline that feels like a massive commercial for the incredibly powerful and stunning Corvette C6 ZR1 - which serves as a main character here in itself.  Regardless, if you're a fan of Arnold, then you'll be pleased with the result of this film and it will be right up your alley.  Once again, it's great to see him back on the big screen in a leading role and it almost makes you wonder how we made it without him for all these years.

This movie is to great movies what a paint-by-number kit with five colors and the fifth one missing is to great art. Arnold looked tired, old and worn-out. His accent actually did him no favors in this movie. He seemed incredibly out-of-place. The movie itself was overly formulaic-- even the formula itself was overly formulaic. Most of the actors seemed to be barely going through the motions in that ""I'm just doing this because the director has my balls in a sling"" kind of way. I did find it interesting though how the people's heads splattered more when they were shot than the cart full of watermelons did which were shot with the same weapons. I'm trying to think of something positive to say about the movie, but I'm drawing a blank. All this is sad (to me) because I have always enjoyed Schwarzenegger movies, even when they have been over-the-top and campy. But this one didn't have any of that feel or flavor. It just came off as a weak attempt to re-ignite Arnold's movie career and just seemed kind of sad. I DON'T wish Arnold would hang it up though-- I just DO wish he would find a better movie vehicle with which to stage his come-back. This one just wasn't it.

I caught up with it on blu-ray the other night and it is an enjoyable little flick, certainly not top-tier Schwarzenneger.Arnold plays the police chief of a small town located near the Mexican border.  A former member of the L.A.P.D., he has survived a shootout that killed several of his friends.  He just wants a little peace and quiet.  This ends when a Mexican drug kingpin escapes (in a rather implausible manner) from the incompetents of the FBI who are bringing him to prison for execution.  He speeds towards Arnold's town in a souped-up Corvette at speeds of 200 MPH while his army of mercenaries builds a bridge for him to speed into Mexico.  The FBI, 2 vehicles of SWAT police and assorted other cops can't stop him..  It is up to Arnold and his very limited police department and the film builds towards its High Noon climax.Lets face it, the plot is of the made-for-tv variety.  It is on the big screen because of the return of Arnold, the greatest action star of the '80s and '90s, after his disappointing stint as Governor of California.Jackass star Johnny Knoxville was mistakenly listed as Arnold's co-star on posters when this film was released.  This is not correct, as his rather obnoxious role was a limited one.The picture and sound on the blu-ray were fine.  There are deleted and extended scenes.  There are some featurettes on the making of this film.  In them, Arnold's co-stars mostly talk about how thrilled they were to work with a living legend while Arnold himself slobbers on about how thrilled he is to work with the films brilliant and &#34;visionary&#34; Korean director.  (The director speaks no English and subtitles are used when he speaks.)Look this film is no Terminator, Total Recall, Commando or Predator.  It is a well-done and enjoyable action film and a welcome-return to the big screen for Arnold Schwarzenneger, a lot older and tireder looking than when we last saw him in Terminator 3.

Although Arnold is not as young and funny as in True Lies, not as series as in Total Recall, and not as strong as in the Terminator, the Sheriff he portrays in this Western is still entertaining. His job as a cop on the Arizona-Mexican border is to protect his territory, while preventing crime. Trouble brews as he meets a no-good Cartel boss with something real bad up his sleeves, and Arnold has to put it to a stop. Sheriff Ray Owens must gather his crew, not fit for the job, and stop the Cartel boss from building a portable bridge in Mexico. Arnold must defend his border, but his helpers may need a lot of backup.

1580729,A24PMZJF0LHGCW,B0090SI4HO,Gilby Mitnick III Jr.,"[3, 9]","The Last Stand is a movie that must be nominated for 2014's Oscar for Best Picture or at least shortlisted for that. The reason is that Arnold Schwarzenegger himself puts in a performance worthy to net him the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Oscars, the People's Choice Awards and even the Golden Globes. When you read my review of his mighty fine piece of thespian method acting, you, too, will understand why.The plot is simple, which alone should give this movie plaudits because it follows the ""Keep It Simple, Stupid"" formula. Schwarzenegger plays a retiring border sheriff by the name of Gerhard Knoblauch, and his deputy is none other than another equally highly regarded method actor, Johnny Knoxville. Together, they make up the law enforcement team in the tiny, American border city called Los Brokeback. They have to face a drug cartel boss called Felipe Calderon, who busts out of an American courthouse to hightail it back to his homeland of Mexico, that cesspool of murders, drugs and unbelievably unfettered corruption in all walks of society (are Club Med's down there still honoring coupons?)Of course, it's up to Knoblauch and Knoxville to stop that burrito from making it into illegal alien land, AKA, Mexico. The plot unfolds in such a seamlessly perfect way that explains why I'm calling for acting awards for Schwarzenegger. For example, every time Schwarzenegger opens his mouth to, I presume, deliver a line or two of dialogue, there is always this ungodly-sounding, thick, unintelligible Austrian accent that distorts everything and makes him speak in non-stop broken English. I mean, for an actor to be able to produce this fine piece of showmanship that has him looking like he's an Austrian refugee who's only pretending to be an American actor is breathtaking. Absolutely breathtaking.And don't even allow me to start on that brilliant supporting thespian named Johnny Knoxville; he is easily a cross between Lionel Barrymore and Jack Nicholson! Throughout The Last Stand, Knoxville's character comes up with increasingly intellectual ways to try and stop the Mexican burrito drug lord from making it back to Mexico. For instance, in one pivotal scene, Knoxville actually staples his balls/a/c/k to some cattle, which promptly stampede away, thereby elongating his body part. In another equally high-minded scene that is extremely relevant to the highly complicated plot development of this movie, Knoxville actually staples his butt cheeks together, then shoves a toy car into his a***, all the while dangling out of a helicopter and bungee jumping. All of these actions of brilliance work to actually stop the Mexican burrito from making it back to Mexico, thereby allowing Knoblauch to apprehend him and send him back to where he belongs (Barack Obama's White House, which makes him a citizen through the Dream Act!!).Folks, please, please, please do yourselves all a damn favor and see The Last Stand. I know, I know, I know that you probably have no money at all since Obama has failed to bring the unemployment rate down from January 2009, when he was inaugurated, but you at least caught a break through Obamacare, which raised your healthcare premiums! Yes.

After a decade of modest obscurity - Where in the world did he go? Was it some missionary work in India? - Arnold Schwarzenegger, 65 years old and perhaps reeking of Preparation H - roars back to action cinema. He's greyer now and his pecs don't quite have that old flex and form, but it's still Arnold, him what we action buffs loved back in the '80s. I guess absence does make the heart grow fonder. Let's face it, folks like the Rock and Vin Diesel just weren't holding it down. No one is quite as large as life as Schwarzenegger.Them powers-that-be, and this includes Arnold, are smart to acknowledge our guy's age. THE LAST STAND is generously peppered with snide remarks about how over-the-hill his character is. And since his age is addressed, we can ease back on bagging on how unconvincing this venture is. Arnold plays grumpy Sheriff Ray Owens, once a Los Angeles narcotics officer until he sought a more peaceful living in the sleepy border town of Sommerton Junction, Arizona. But Owens' ""retirement"" gig heats up when word reaches him that sadistic cartel boss Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) has escaped federal custody and means to cross the border into Mexico. And Cortez may be heading his way. Owens' old instincts are triggered when he notices a suspicious crew of out-of-town truckers lazing about. His instincts don't play him false. These ""truckers"" are hard-core mercenaries set to rendezvous with Cortez. Man, if only there were a monster gatling gun in the house or something.And there is. One of the boons of this film is its entertaining supporting cast, one of which is Johnny Knoxville. He plays the local kook who runs the firearms museum and who gets some of the best lines and delivers onto the Sheriff a hellacious Vickers Gatling Gun. Knoxville, along with Luis Guzm&aacute;n (irascible), Jaimie Alexander (cute and feisty), and Rodrigo Santoro (not cute at all and boozy), comprise Schwarzenegger's outgunned deputies. They tend to counterbalance Schwarzenegger's rustiness and creakiness. Give the Arnold a break. It's been a long minute since he'd starred in one of these.THE LAST STAND, treating us with a solid ""R"" rating, is Schwarzenegger at his most vintage. The film likens itself to past action hits that may have been less ambitious but were still massively entertaining (RAW DEAL, COMMANDO, READ HEAT, THE RUNNING MAN). There's a sense of campiness. The plot is wafer thin. Still, you're advised to be generous with the genre tropes and the inevitable plot holes. Despite that discouraging trailer, there's much to like onscreen. This is acclaimed Korean director Kim Jee-Woon's first English speaking film, except he doesn't allow that to hamper his style. He invigorates most every scene with vitality and a comic touch. He prevents the material from collapsing.There's a strong element of the Western, a whiff of oaters like EL DORADO and such. While the first half of THE LAST STAND is mostly set-up, the second half is an explosive, crowd-pleasing, action fiend's dream. Not that he has a choice, but I appreciate that Schwarzenegger sticks to what he does best: firing big guns, occasionally bestowing a wicked suplex on a fella, and dropping a deadpan one-liner or two. As always, Arnold indulges in a bit of self-aware humor. You don't see Arnold doing wire-fu. That would be a travesty. Schwarzenegger, looking fairly fit and spry (even his wrinkles have muscles), reportedly did as many stunts as he could. I guess the restful missionary work in India was good for recovery time from his exertions in past action thrillers.So it seems that he's back to stay, and I'm glad. I enjoyed myself silly watching THE LAST STAND. I don't know how much of my enjoyment was derived from nostalgia. Maybe later Schwarzenegger pictures of this ilk will end up boring the crap out of me. But not for a while. I'm looking forward to his upcoming projects: his team-up with Stallone in the prison break thriller, THE TOMB (2013), and most especially his reprise of Conan the Barbarian, THE LEGEND OF CONAN (2014).

There was some good humor thrown in here and there too, and of course I had to chuckle at the fact that Johnny Knoxville was in this movie...before then I'd never actually pictured he and Arnie in a movie together, but it was honestly pretty great.

There's the improbable but spectacular jail break, some unlikely but gripping car racing against helicopters, and a reasonable young ensemble cast supporting the aging Governator in defending his tiny town against a ruthless but stereotyped Mexican drug lord.In case you're wondering, Arnie is looking old, and there are plenty of references to this throughout the film. Still, the action is well paced if not a little predictable and it's a fun way to spend a couple of hours with some optimistically inventive assaults by the bad guys, and the FBI operating in a less-than-competent mode while they wait for our small town Sheriff to do the jobs of an entire SWAT team.There are a few stunts that will have the ever-loving disbelief suspended away from you but the camerawork and direction is fluid enough to feel the excitement rather than unlikelihood of the whole thing.

This fast-paced bullet-riddled comedy is entertaining from the first frame. I've never laughed through a bloody shoot-out before but our screening audience had a great time. Korean director Jee-woon Kim (""The Good, the Bad and the Weird"") brings chop-socky experience and a great sense of humor to the screen with non-stop, clich&eacute;-ridden energy.All the humor is character driven, so let's talk about the characters:* Arnold Schwarzenegger (""The Expendables"") is a weary sheriff in a little bitty (fictitious) Arizona border town, just putting in his time until retirement. He saw enough action in Los Angeles and was tired of blood, so he has moved here to relax.* Luis Guzman (""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"") is his chief deputy. He's not a coward, but he IS a realist, so when they hear that a high-powered jefe from a drug cartel is headed their way, he's thinking maybe they could look the other way ""just for a little while...""* Zach Gilford (""Crazy Kind of Love"") is one of our hero's hapless deputies. The first thing he does is break his nose while target shooting because he doesn't expect a high-caliber pistol to kick.* Jaimie Alexander (""Thor"") is another deputy, scared spitless, but she's game.* Johnny Knoxville (Lots of TV) is one of the local yokels who volunteers to help our hero; but this gun lover INSISTS on being deputized. I laughed at his metal military helmet dangling on a rope as he is helped to cover.* Eduardo Noriega (""Blackthorn"") is that aforementioned jefe, skillfully driving a singularly designed Corvette muscle car. He is smart, tough and determined.* Forest Whitaker (""Repo Men"") is with the FBI; the stunningly clever jailbreak happens on his watch and he WILL bring back his prisoner, the most wanted drug kingpin in the Western hemisphere.* Genesis Rodriguez (""Casa de mi Padre"") is a lovely FBI agent taken hostage by that nasty escapee.We have memorable thugs, a wonderful assortment of townspeople (some of whom have great reasons to stay in the diner), muscle cars, great use of a corn field, unlimited firepower, lots of blood, several humorous through lines that pop up at just the right moment, one little kiss and some appropriate profanity.

After watching the movie I have mixed feelings. Its good to see him again in the kind of role that made him famous, but it just isn't the same anymore. Much of that has to do with the movie being too campy at times with a convoluted and unbelievable storyline, but its also hard to watch one of your childhood action stars literally become too old to play a role like this convincingly, which is made worse by the mediocre story and directing. There are portions of the movie that are fun to watch and a few good jokes, but overall I felt unsatisfied at the end. There is a reason this movie was a bomb at the box office. Maybe some of that has to do with today's generation only really knowing Arnold as a politician, but its also because the movie just isn't that good.

What you will notice after watching it is that most of the action is not right away which if you ask me gives a movie time to create a story, plot, you know something worth spending your time on. This type of movie in modern days is rare to say the lease, it is worthy of the 4stars. In this movie Arnold plays the role of an old time cop that lives in a small town, this day is his day off and hes not doing anything what could go wrong right? Well expect it all to happen, from hot bullets flying to fast cars crashing and a few hard throws with fist, lets not forget the unique guns used in some parts as well, this is a movie that will get your mind going right away, it will keep you guessing. Enjoy this speed ride from handcuffs to gun fights, it all happens.Please note that when i rate a movie i don't always give a movie 5 stars if i like it a lot, when i rate something like a movie i take into consideration that i have to look at it as if i was not a fan of the movie, say like i were just watching a random movie and type. So if i were to watch a movie i really loved and was a fan of it i wouldn't give it any extra stars just because i liked it more then other people did, and i think this is very important in rating movies.4 out of 5 stars, reasons are that it was a great movie however the action in it seemed a bit chill for the general parts or major parts of the movie, while this is not always a bad thing, in this case i felt that this caused the film to become a slightly lower standard in its area of action movies.Last note, I would recommend this movie to everyone, as long as they were over the age of 13 and understood fiction and truth.

But anyway getting to this review for The Last Stand which is Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1st leading role in 10 years. Made on a budget of $30 or $45 million made a very disappointing $6 million in it's opening weekend the number 1 film of that weekend was some movie called Mama which I am sure is a run of the mill horror film. Or a movie like Machete that was suppose to be a exploitation, revenge film instead was about the border & very pretentious. This movie is what Machete should've been. Directed by Kim Ji Woon this has been the only movie that I have seen that he has directed. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Sheriff Ray Owens,Eduardo Noriega as Cortez,n Johnny Knoxville as Lewis Dirkum, Peter Stormare as Burell, Jamie Alexander as Deputy Torrance Zach Gilford as Deputy Bailey, Forest Wittaker as Agent John Banister, Genesis Rodriguez as Agent Ellen Richards, Luis Guzman as Deputy Mike Figerola & Rodrigo Santoro as Frank Martienez. The story is you have this Drug Lord named Cortez escape FBI custody when his henchies takes this giant magnet that picks up the van he is in Cortez kills the guards he escapes takes an agent named Ellen Richards hostage & leaves in a Corvette C6 ZR1 that has been modified. Meanwhile you have this Sheriff named Ray Owens who is Sheriff in a small town he gets a call that this local farmer played by Harry Dean Stanton hasn't delivered any milk at the local Diner. A couple of his deputies Jerry Bailey & Sarah Torrance check out the farmers house where they find him dead they look outside where they find blood & tire tracks leading to The Canyons. Meanwhile Agent John Banister has the local cops set up a blockade to stop Cortez but his henchies gun the cops down a Bulldozer comes through knocks some cop cars out of the way Cortez speeds through in his Corvette & dodges the remaining SWAT Trucks. Then you go back to that farm house where Sheriff Owens & another Deputy Mike Figuerola they find the body & they find out that Deputies Torrance & Bailey are going into a trap. Then you have Burell a guy that is going to help Cortez escape The US. They open fire at Deputies Bailey & Torrance. Burell shoots Deputy Bailey in the back with a Sniper Rifle. Sheriff Owens drives up saves his Deputies guns some of Burell's hencies down with his Shot Gun. Deputy Bailey dies later on. Agent Banister contacts Sheriff Owens he tells him about Cortez. He prepares to go to war with Burell & stop Cortez. Owens Deputizes a local man named Frank Martinez cause he was friends with Deputy Bailey. Owens goes to this guy named Lewis Dirkum who has a lot of illegal firearms. He goes to The Diner & tells the people in there to go home for their safety. This scene is funny where the old guy tells him ""I'm 72 years old I'm eating an omlet with extra bacon & cheese do you think I'm afraid of death."" I know I messed that line up but. Then Burell & his men show up at town square where you get a series of really good action scenes where Deputy Figuerola is pinned down behind a car. This was really over the top in a good way where Burell takes a rocket launcher fires it at the car that Deputy Figuerola is hiding behind & Figuerola is still alive & comes out firing a machine gun starts firing it at Burell's men but he is shot by a sniper. You have Sheriff Owens in the back of an old School Bus firing a mini gun from T2. Dirkum shoots a flare gun at 1 of the henchies & he is blown apart. That character Frank comes into the picture he drives the bus into town square & runs over 1 of Burell's men. He also saves Deputy Torrance from being killed. The scene with the old lady is beyond hilarious. Burell tries to escape in the school bus but is killed by Sheriff Owens. Burell's phone rings & Owens answer's it. It's Cortez Owens lets him know who he is. Cortez speeds through town square Owens steals The Mayor's Corvette which you have a battle of The Corvettes. Not going further into the plot I pretty much told a little bit of what happens. The Last Stand was a fun movie & a solid 1 at that the only problems was it is kind of slow early on the main villain isn't all that great. But you have likeable & funny characters & some really good action set pieces. Kim Ji woon did a good job directing.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was really good. Forest Wittaker did a decent job. Johnny Knoxville was ok. Genesis Rodriguez was ok. Rodrigo Santoro was ok. Zach Gilford was ok Peter Stormaro was good. Jamie Alexander did a good job. Luis Guzman did a pretty good job. Like I said only 2 or 3 issues with the movie but overall a solid fun movie.",4,Arnold still has it 8/10 might have spoilers,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,4759,"['Here', 'am', 'review', 'account',

Playing a remote border Sheriff in Texas who just wanted to be left alone. Then, perhaps because of the remote location, the Mexican Drug Cartel's escaping leader decides to invade the self-induced exile to the nether-regions of the Texas borders.The story is believable to most of America that has not experienced the NEW border crossings of USA-MEXICO. The Sheriff is bigger than life itself, enduring unending tortuous pain to rise up victorious.Good acting (sometimes stretched) combined with unbelievable gun battles where the strength of the Texas Cars are shown to be better than anything Detroit built, delivers all the action that you will need.

1580842,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B0090SI4HO,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Now that's what I'm talking about! It's been quite some time since we've seen Schwarzenegger in a lead role, but he comes back hard with his latest action flick, The Last Stand. I can't say that I've ever been a Schwarzenegger enthusiast by any means, but I understand his significance in the film industry so I've never been able to write him off completely. To be honest, I only watched The Last Stand out of sheer curiosity, but damn did I have fun. Achieving the perfect balance of action and comedy, The Last Stand manages to not only be enjoyable, but it kept me engaged the entire time.You follow Sheriff Ray Owens (Schwarzenegger), a former officer for the LAPD. After performing a job that went terribly wrong, Owens resigned from the department only to settle in Sommerton Junction, Arizona. A small little town that sees very little action, most crimes in the town are petty and forgettable, but that's about to change very soon. Owens receives word that international drug lord Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) has escaped from the clutches of the FBI in Las Vegas and is headed toward Sommerton. After meeting some suspicious truckers and finding the local farmer dead, he has a gut feeling that everything is connected. So he groups up his band of misfits -- Deputy Sarah Torrence (Jaimie Alexander), Deputy Mike Figuerola (Luis Guzman), former Marine Frank Martinez (Rodrigo Santoro), and local whack-job Lewis Dinkum (Johnny Knoxville) -- to stop Cortez and his gang and bring him to justice.Some may argue that the story is merely there as an outline for the action, but I think that does a disservice to the writers and the performers. Yes, there's explosions, firefights, and the like, but there's more to the story than that. To me, it was more about a man finding peace within his past. Letting go of what was and enjoying what is. From the get-go you can tell that Owens is a troubled character, but until about half-way through you don't know why. Then once you hear his story you understand and it all makes sense. Not only that, but you begin to feel for him because you can see the pain he feels both emotionally and physically as the story plays out. It was really quite surprising how real everything felt.Still, if blood and guts aren't your thing then it would be best to avoid this. While The Last Stand may not be an over-the-top gore-fest, they weren't afraid to let their imagination's fly in the final action sequences. It should be noted that most of this is done for comedic effect and I was actually surprised at how much I laughed while watching this. There was a point within the final half-hour where I began to cry because I was laughing so hard. Even when I called out a sequence beforehand it was still hysterical because I was still laughing from something that happened a few seconds prior. I always enjoy a good story that doesn't take itself too seriously and The Last Stand definitely falls into that category.As I said, it's been awhile since we've seen Arnold take the lead, but it seemed like this role was made for him. Maybe it's his years of experience or just his ability to get into character, but I can't picture anyone else playing the troubled Sheriff Owens. He gives off this very confident vibe the entire time which helps make the role feel comfortable and less stiff. It's this comfortability that becomes the driving force for the whole movie, in my opinion. Whether it's Arnold's performance as Owens or Forest Whitaker's performance as Agent John Bannister, the viewer can be at ease because no actor feels out of place. Even the minor roles like Sarah and Lewis felt perfect and it's almost insane how spot-on the casting was across the board. It's obvious that Knoxville was there more for comedic effect, but I find it hard to complain when the role was so perfect.Finally, the film's score, composed by Korean composer Mowg, was excellent. While there wasn't a lot of compositions scattered throughout the scenes, the ones that were there felt right at home. Most of them had this very Western-y kind of vibe which suited the film perfectly. I personally enjoyed these pieces more than the some of the high-energy compositions found during the chase scenes and such, but that's mostly because they seemed a bit more creative in comparison.Overall Score: 8/10 - I don't say this too often, but what I really enjoyed about The Last Stand was that it was fun. Pure, simple fun that wasn't brought down by a nonsensical story. It has heart and drive, but it was also able to give you some nice firefights and a handful of laugh-out-loud moments. The end result is definitely better than I anticipated going in. If you had your eye on this I would recommend giving it a shot. It may not be groundbreaking, but, like I said, it's fun and it has a really solid cast.",4,8/10 - Surprisingly good,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,4879,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Now', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'been', 'quite', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Schwarzenegger', 'lead', 'role', 'back', 'hard', 'latest', 'action', 'flick', 'Last', 'Stand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'Schwarzenegger', 'enthusiast', 'means', 'understand', 'significance', 'film', 'industry', 'so', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'able', 'write', 'off', 'completely', 'be', 'honest', 'only', 'watched', 'Last', 'Stand', 'sheer', 'curiosity', 'damn', 'did', 'have', 'fun', 'Achieving', 'perfect', 'balance', 'action', 'comedy', 'Last', 'Stand', 'manages', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'kept', 'engaged', 'entire', 'time.You', 'follow', 'Sheriff', 'Ray', 'Owens', 'Schwarzenegger', 'former', 'officer', 'LAPD', 'performing', 'job', 'went', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'Owens', 'resigned', 'department', 'only', 'settle', 'Sommerton', 'Junction', 'Arizona', 'A', 'small', 'little', 'town', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'most', 'crimes', 'town', 'are', 'petty', 'forgettable', 'change', 'very', 'soon', 'Owens', 'word', 'international', 'drug', 'lord', 'Gabriel', 'Cortez', 'Eduardo', 'Noriega', 'escaped', 'clutches', 'FBI', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'headed', 'Sommerton', 'meeting', 'suspicious', 'truckers', 'finding', 'local', 'farmer', 'dead', 'gut', 'feeling', 'everything', 'connected', 'groups', 'up', 'band', 'misfits', 'Deputy', 'Sarah', 'Torrence', 'Jaimie', 'Alexander', 'Deputy', 'Mike', 'Figuerola', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'former', 'Marine', 'Frank', 'Martinez', 'Rodrigo', 'Santoro', 'local', 'whack-job', 'Lewis', 'Dinkum', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'stop', 'Cortez', 'gang', 'bring', 'justice.Some', 'may', 'argue', 'story', 'merely', 'outline', 'action', 'think', 'disservice', 'writers', 'performers', 'Yes', 'explosions', 'firefights', 'like', 'more', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'man', 'finding', 'peace', 'past', 'Letting', 'go', 'what', 'was', 'enjoying', 'what', 'get-go', 'can', 'tell', 'Owens', 'troubled', 'character', 'half-way', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Then', 'once', 'hear', 'story', 'understand', 'sense', 'Not', 'only', 'begin', 'feel', 'can', 'see', 'pain', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'story', 'out', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'surprising', 'how', 'real', 'everything', 'felt.Still', 'blood', 'guts', 'are', ""n't"", 'thing', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'avoid', 'Last', 'Stand', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'over-the-top', 'gore-fest', 'were', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'let', 'imagination', 'fly', 'final', 'action', 'sequences', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'most', 'done', 'comedic', 'effect', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'laughed', 'watching', 'was', 'point', 'final', 'half-hour', 'where', 'began', 'cry', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'Even', 'when', 'called', 'out', 'sequence', 'beforehand', 'was', 'still', 'hysterical', 'was', 'still', 'laughing', 'something', 'happened', 'few', 'seconds', 'prior', 'always', 'enjoy', 'good', 'story', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'Last', 'Stand', 'definitely', 'category.As', 'said', 'been', 'awhile', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Arnold', 'take', 'lead', 'seemed', 'role', 'was', 'made', 'Maybe', 'years', 'experience', 'just', 'ability', 'get', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'picture', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'troubled', 'Sheriff', 'Owens', 'very', 'confident', 'entire', 'time', 'make', 'role', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'less', 'stiff', 'comfortability', 'driving', 'force', 'whole', 'movie', 'opinion', 'Arnold', 'performance', 'Owens', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'performance', 'Agent', 'John', 'Bannister', 'viewer', 'can', 'be', 'ease', 'actor', 'place', 'Even', 'minor', 'roles', 'Sarah', 'Lewis', 'felt', 'perfect', 'almost', 'insane', 'how', 'spot-on', 'casting', 'was', 'board', 'obvious', 'Knoxville', 'was', 'there', 'more', 'comedic', 'effect', 'find', 'hard', 'complain', 'when', 'role', 'was', 'so', 'perfect.Finally', 'film', 'score', 'composed', 'Korean', 'composer', 'Mowg', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'compositions', 'scattered', 'scenes', 'ones', 'were', 'felt', 'right', 'home', 'Most', 'had', 'very', 'Western-y', 'kind', 'vibe', 'suited', 'film', 'perfectly', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'pieces', 'more', 'high-energy', 'compositions', 'found', 'chase', 'scenes', 'such', 'mostly', 'seemed', 'bit', 'more', 'creative', 'comparison.Overall', 'Score', '8/10', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'often', 'what', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Last', 'Stand', 'was', 'was', 'fun', 'Pure', 'simple', 'fun', 'was', ""n't"", 'brought', 'down', 'nonsensical', 'story', 'heart', 'drive', 'was', 'also', 'able', 'give', 'nice', 'firefights', 'handful', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'end', 'result', 'definitely', 'better', 'anticipated', 'going', 'had', 'eye', 'would', 'recommend', 'giving', 'shot', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'groundbreaking', 'said', 'fun', 'really', 'solid', 'cast']",The Last Stand

1580847,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B0090SI4HO,judy,"[0, 1]","Man, Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting old! And believe it or not it shows! A lot.  I don't know why I liked this movie so much, I really don't. This movie warrants a 2 and a half star rating yet I switched it to 3 and a half star review. I just liked this movie for no reason. It kept my attention span. Arnold, who is now I believe 60, and when he filmed this at 58, seems to be taking serious damage at every step he takes. Sadly, it might be time for this old man to hang in the towel soon. This film isn't that great, this movie isn't even good, it's bad, and really lame, and laughable but for some reason I liked it. Not because of Arnold, Arnold, hangs on to this film like a dirty towel basically. Well anyways let's get on with this review, let's start with the negatives. The negatives include the cast, plot, Arnold Schwarzenegger, action, music, character development, the acting, and screen time. O.K didn't I tell you that there's a lot to hate? Yes, I know this is going to cause a small controversy from my fans. Well anyways most of this cast are just very poorly chosen.  While I love Arnold, I really think he should have been recast with someone like maybe Bruce Willis. Yes, I know I critically bombed Bruce, for Looper, but he wasn't right for that rule, I think he would have been perfect for this one though. And then we have Ms. Genesis Rodriguez, who was poorly cast, as well as comedian, Luis Guzman. For starters Luis just doesn't look serious enough to be a deputy. Well I can kinda see it but he doesn't seem right. And as for Genesis, how convincing can she seems as a cop? Not too much.  This movie's plot is very weak, and a bit loose. This movie falls threw a couple plot holes. Such as having too villains and neither really having any reason to do anything. I mean the plot is a group of people must defend their small town from a lot of invading bad guys. Wow, plots now a days are getting really thin. How far this go / a guy can tries to get to Mexico and with the help of a dozen dudes with guns and his 100 mile per hour car a lover hostage he can do it! This is nothing we haven't seen another hundred times before. Arnold, Arnold, Arnold.  Dude I think I have said enough about you, so let's move on. The action is very minimal, for a film that has little else to do then for explosions and action. The plot has nothing to do, it's so bored. I think they should have added more action, for the actors to do. Everybody just looks lazy in this film. The action is poor even when it happens, it's not well done and the action is 5 minutes in between each other. The music in this movie is very minimal, and not very well chosen. The music adds little to the action, and makes everything happening less exciting in my opinion. Man, why couldn't they pick up some of the soundtrack to Fast Five, and Rango and mash it up and turn it into ""The Last Stand Soundtrack"". Now that would be music to remember. But here we have a bunch of UN admirable music to add. Man one of the worst things with this movie is its character development. I mean i really just don't get any of the characters. I mean we have Johnny Knoxville as Lewis, and I really don't get who he is. All I know is that he has a museum and has a relic gun which he has named. I mean what? And also we have Frank Martinez, the villain who I really don't understand at all. Why, the heck is he in prison to begin with?  I don't really get it.  This film gives little screen time to the people involved including Johnny Knoxville's Lewis who we see only  for about 20 minutes altogether, which gives us no time to  develop his character as I have already talked about. Also they should have shortened, Peter Stormare's character, to add more time for the main villain to develop some more.  And shorten Forest Whitaker's character so that we can have more time for Sheriff Ray Owens, played by Arnold, to develop. Now onto the positives with this film including,  Rodrigo Santoro, ending, visuals, car stunts,  and just that I liked it. Rodrigo, was excellent as this film's villain, even though he was given a very small time on camera he was excellent in all of it. He really can act like a villain. He scared the heck out of me, he did. He was very devilish.  The ending was an epic car race between Arnold and Rodrigo's character; I felt that Rodrigo really had a chance of getting away until Arnold's Sheriff showed up at the bridge. The race and battle at the bridge were really suspenseful. I thought Arnold was going to kill him and the same for Rodrigo.  The visuals were spot on as well. Even though there wasn't much visuals needed, when the car crashed into the polish vehicles it looked really good!!! The car stunts were epic, when Rodrigo's character crashed into the police car and flipped it over that was really cool.  Believe it or not I just liked this movie. I know it doesn't justify why I would rate this 3 and a half stars, what with all the negatives with this movie. I just liked it and that's that.  Everything I said is kinda miner for me. All in All, this is a pretty big disappointment, but I liked it anyways. Arnold is getting way to old and it dragged this movie down a lot maybe he should go back to politics or better yet - retire.

I am an escape artist!That said, there is a lot to recommend about this movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger for one. I am old enough to remember Arnold when he was a real movie star in the Terminator series, Total Recall, True Lies, The 6th Day, etc. One thing you could always count on when Arnold was at his best, was his sense of humor which was in complete juxtaposition with his appearance. He rarely took himself seriously even if the material he was acting did. That is a gift few actors have. And to see this Arnold up on the screen again was a joy for me to behold!I normally would not give such a fairly innocuous movie 5 stars. But Arnold once again, took the material given and made it his own. Which meant it was a rollicking good time with laughs and excitement and a bit of horror all thrown together. Simple ME! I loved every minute of it and, if you just want a fun, escapist movie to lose yourself in for 90 or so minutes, then this won't disappoint!

Swanson,"[1, 2]","Ahnold has always entertained me, from seeing him in Pumping Iron as a kid and then Conan, the Terminators, Total Recall, a few other fairly fine films, and then of course perhaps his dramatic apogee as Mr. Freeze, a role that clearly would have received the Oscar nod if it was anyone other than Ahnold. But then Hollywood's anti-Austrian sentiment has never been a big secret.Sadly, Arnie's performance here is not quite up the lofty standards of Mr. Freeze, or even Lou Ferrigno (or Lou's dad). This may in fact be the worst on-screen work Arnie has ever done, which in its own way is quite a statement. But from the ham-handed and beyond ridiculous script to the millions of spent casings littering the screen, The Last Stand stands, staggers and then falls as Ahnold's nadir.(And the blu-ray is terrible as well, not one special feature or commentary. Message to studios: trailers are NOT special features!)Nothing makes sense in The Last Stand in any way, which would be fine if it wasn't trying to. But the Govanata is taking semi-serious aim here at the Mexican drug cartels, political correctness, feds and a bunch of other things, and misses on almost every count. The cartels are apparently staffed and headed by Europeans; the feds and other branches of Arizona law enforcement don't know how to get to the Arizona border within a few hours even when huge shootouts erupt (well, that might be true); guys like Knoxville have insanely felonius machine guns ready to go at any moment, and a few thousand rounds to stick in them; and many other truly nonsensical plot points. I know, it's all supposed to be crazy fun, but if Arnie wants to get political about it all, which he does here, portraying himself as a Clint/Gary Cooper kind of sheriff saving the American Way, he could at least make a stab at semi-believability. You know, like Mr. Freeze.And why is Forest Whittaker in this? He plays it as he always does, painfully serious, and derails the possible comedy while highlighting how sadly unserious this whole enterprise is. Strange casting choice. ""Ah vant to act with a SEERIOUS acta!""The most notable thing to me was that TLS is the first Ahnold film where he not only doesn't flirt with women, but goes out of his way to barely notice them at all in a male-female sort of way. Still stinging from his bonking-the-maid scandal, the mighty Schwarz is merely polite to every woman in the film. Ahnold the Gelded! It's hard to see him now and not think of the cigar-chomping maid-bonking Governator, no matter how hard he tries to polish his image, such as it is.Maybe the worst moments here are when Ahnold pauses and almost yells at us, ""Ahm goin to make anotha classic Ahnold statement nowww, pleeez listen und then loff und cheer like you should!"". Then he'll utter something typically Ahnold...but the old get-in-tha-choppa magic is gone, and now it just feels overdone with the humor removed. Hasta la vista, Arnie.All in all, I expected a hare-brained adventure and that's what this is, except the hare is a tiny little buuny wabbit with a bwain the size of a pea. Nothing really works except Knoxville, who plays his role purely for laughs with the sort of mindless glee and disregard for reality that the whole movie should have had. Instead, it takes itself too seriously times ten and ends up being just plain stupid.Poor Ahnold. He probably won't get the Oscar for this one either.If he's smart he'll give up action and politics and stick to the comedy, where he truly belongs.Imagine if Mr. Freeze went to the melting polar ice caps.Extremely heavily armed, of course.

In my opinion there are too many secondary characters and none of them gets fully developed in this movie. Arnold has no love interest or family in this movie. So all you are really left with is the action. This is the kind of movie that you really only want to watch once, so I'm not sure if investing in a Blu-Ray disc is the best idea. If I had it to do over, I would just rent the movie from Netflix or Red Box. This movie and its plot are no where near the quality of movies such as the ""Die Hard"" or ""Lethal Weapon"" series.

But one can really see the oxide that had built up over the 10 years between full-time gigs. It seemed that, while heading a state government, the past decade of clamping down his natural, and sometimes overbearingly positive, personality had a more profound and lingering effect.In this production, he plays a sheriff in a small Southern California town that is way off the beaten track. The former LA special services cop has found peace and serenity dealing with the mundanity of parking violations and the occasional drunk. Unbeknownst to him - his life and the lives of the residents are about to be upended by an escaped drug lord intent on driving through their land into Mexico and freedom from US law enforcement.Aided by a cadre of hardcore private contractors who have been hired to, quite literally, clear a path - can the sheriff stop the determined felon and his band of heavily armed mercenaries with just a handful of backwater officers? Utilizing one of Arnie's trademark menacing squinty-eyed quips, ""I've got an idea.""The tiresome and trite opening of this flick is happily forgotten when the action elements pick up steam a little past a third of the way in. And despite the fanciful (read ludicrous) premise of the screenplay, was the only reason I stuck with it to the end.Overall, entertaining enough and worth the one-time screening. But anyone expecting an Arnie movie of old will be disappointed. In spite of the very enjoyable high speed chase sequences, there just wasn't enough invested in establishing the characters beyond their perfunctory sketchy outline. One has to put that onus on Korean director Jee-woon Kim. Like many non-western directors, they often struggle to successfully transplant, translate and transform their skills to and for the US palette. More so given that this was his very first production outside his country.Hopefully, Arnie works on a better vehicle with a more proven director.Movie Notes:- To the best of my knowledge, this is only the second time a large industrial magnet is used to hijack an armored transport in a film. One of my all-time favorite &uuml;ber classic comedies - the original 1979 version ofThe In-Laws.- How about that cameo Conan sword and pose? Nice!  :-D- As 2013 marks his (non-cameo) featured return to the big show - and in keeping with their friendly feud - I would say that Sly Stallone's recent 'Bullet To The Head' is a tad better and a bit more enjoyable production.

Meanwhile the bad guys plan to come through the town and get into mexico, because once you make it over that hill, you've made it.Typical fare in between all that, including minor car chases/crashes, gunplay and ""this is my town"", lets ""standown"", etc....  The action scenes will you keep you entertained, I enjoyed the desert setting and overall its a decent action story, just nothing superior to any of his early films.  The movie also has a part played by Johnny Knoxville, this time as a local who is a little nutty, but also character who becomes needed when the good guys need to borrow his gun stash.If you like somewhat dumb action movies, with little complex thinking involved this is your flick.

Forest Whitaker appears as FBI Agent John Bannister and basically does what he does in 85 of all his other movies...look really concerned and give a lot of orders. Peter Stormare (Fargo / Big Lebowski) is another bad guy who ramps up the fun just by being Peter Stormare. Johnny Knoxville adds comic relief to the action. Veteran character actor Luis Guzm&aacute;n (you'll recognize him immediately) does a brilliant turn as Arnie's deputy...he wants no part of what's about to come down and doesn't hesitate when it comes to saying it. Lovers of the Chevrolet Camaro will be heartbroken during the cornfield scene, but the moment this pristine red beauty appears on screen you know it's not just going to spend the entire film parked in the red zone. Is this as great as Arnie's first wave of classic action films? No, but he can still deliver the goods, and he is still undeniably fun to watch on screen.

Honestly, I can see why.  Last Stand is a very generic action film with Arnold starring in it.  It is quite boring, the characters are quite lame, most of the performances missed the mark, and Arnold seemed like he was sleepwalking throughout the entire film.The plot is very simple.  An escape convict named Cortez has escaped from FBI custody and is heading for the town of Summerton Junction.  It is now up to Sherif Ray Owens (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his deputies to stop him and his friends.  The plot is very straight-forward, which I do not mind if the movie is fun and the characters are enjoyable but that is not really the case.Arnold really has no energy here.  He just seemed like he was on auto-pilot, and he had no memorable lines.  I know he is getting older but I have seen him give better performances lately.  He gave a much better performance in Escape Plan.  The other actors did not do a great job either.  Everyone either underacts or overacts their lines, particularly the FBI boss played by Forest Whitaker.  He is supposed to be intimidating but he just comes off as so over-the-top in this that I could not take him seriously.  The only actor who does a decent job is Jaimie Alexander who plays the female deputy.  She is one of the best actresses working today and deserves more jobs.  She plays the only somewhat decent character too.  The villains are one-note, which would be fine if the movie was fun and the good guys were fun, but that is not the case.The only saving grace was that some of the action scenes are well-done.  I like that that this is a hard R and they do not pull punches with the violence.  They go for PG-13 a lot lately to make the film more marketable.  Some of the action scenes particularly the action scene at the end was quite good.  However I do not think there were enough action scenes.  The beginning of the film was very slow and boring.  A slow build is fine if the characters are fun, but they&#8217;re not.  Also much of the film seemed to be dedicated to promoting cars.  A good portion of this film felt like a car commercial.  It was horrible.Overall, The Last stand is a forgettable action film.  It had some fun action scenes, but the characters are nothing, the villain is nothing, only a couple people gave a good performance, Arnold is on auto-pilot, and much of the film felt like a car commercial.  I can see why no one saw this film when it came out and why it is now forgotten.

Sly's film looked ridiculous and stupid, not to mention he is after thugs that took his daughter. How original. But then Arnold's movie trailer comes on and it seems pretty clear we are going to get good guys and bad guys in an unlikely shoot-out, but damn if it doesn't look like fun. And damn if it isn't.Schwarzenegger plays Sheriff Ray Owens, a small town cop on the Arizona-Mexico border. Coming his way from Las Vegas is an escaped cartel boss (Eduardo Noriega) in a souped-up Corvette ZR-1. In a ridiculous and convoluted scenario, this occurs during a transfer supervised by FBI agent John Bannister played by Forest Whitaker in a performance about as lame as his character's management of the transfer. Maybe Whitaker just couldn't understand director Jee-woon Kim's instructions.The fun really starts when Cortez (Noriega) approaches the border town. You see Cortez is also a professional race car driver. Think about it. In an earlier set up, Cortez has sent a cadre of henchmen ahead to prepare a portable bridge over a ravine into Mexico. Since everyone is out of town at a football game, the sheriff will have to defend their border with an out-of-shape deputy (Luis Guzman), another pair of deputies new to the job (Zach Gilford and Jaimie Alexander), the town drunk/ Iraq War veteran (Rodrigo Santoro) and town gadfly (Johnny Knoxville).Arnold is at his self-deprecating best as the tired veteran of the L.

The leader of a Mexican drug cartel is sprung from jail in Las Vegas, and is speeding down towards the Mexican border in a souped-up Corvette ZR1 (the other co-star of the movie). The last thing standing between him and freedom in Mexico is a small border town in Arizona, where Arnold is the Sheriff and his staff is small.Several comments: the plot is totally secondary to the action, and at that level, the movie delivers, period. There is hardly any lull in the movie. The highlight for me personnaly was the car chase between Arnold and the Mexican drig lord in the Arizona cornfield, which is staged beautifully, almost like a ballet of cars. Kudos to Korean director Jee-woon Kim who knows a thing or two about action movies but makes his Hollywood debut with this one. Well done. As to Arnold, he has definitely aged since his last major starring role in 2003 (Terminator 3), but he hasn't lost his sense of humor. When the Mexican drug lord at the very end tries to bribe Arnold with multi-millions, Arnold responds (in full Arnold-accent): ""You make us immigrants look bad!"" I just had to laugh out loud at that (I'm a first generation immigrant from Europe myself).This movie outright bombed at the box office last weekend. I almost didn't go see it but then several things changed my mind: both Entertainment Weekly and the Financial Times (whose movie reviewers I respect a great amount) gave it strong reviews, and my 26 yr. old son gave it 2 thumbs up after he saw it with his friends last weekend. I decided to check it out. So glad I did. There is nothing ""revolutionary"" about this movie, but it's mindless entertainment and a quality action movie, period.

Sommerton Junction, Arizona is a sleepy border town with so little crime one of the deputies wants a transfer to Los Angeles PD. Act I, Sommerton, AZ: all is calm and quiet, except for visiting drivers of a strange 18 wheel truck. Act II, Las Vegas, NV: a daring escape by a ruthless criminal. Act III, convergence of plots, with hot sports cars in the middle of it all. Amid the bullets and bombs, Arnold gets a chance to do some serious, sensitive acting scenes as a beer-swigging, peace-loving Sheriff Ray Owens who is on his day off when trouble arrives in his town. This movie has some great chase scenes featuring a form of the director's famous `trunk cam shots' and ends with an unusual climatic chase scene and a great showdown in a unique place. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Forest Whitaker, Eduardo Noriega, Johnny Knoxville, Rodrigo Santoro, Jaimie Alexander (""Lady Sif"" from the Marvel movies and TV show), Genesis Rodriguez (from ""Man of a Ledge""), and well-known character actor Luis Guzman.

The problem is that the movie does take itself seriously at times in the style of ""Criminal Minds"". The FBI Agents even use one of those cool FBI luxury jets. This was a big mistake because it makes all law enforcement look like Keystone Cops and Arnold Schwarzenegger looks like a nursing home resident who wanted one last day on the job before retiring. The FBI was notified that the drug lord was going to Arnold Schwarzenegger's town so they send a SWAT team. The problem is that the entire SWAT team fits into JUST 2 VEHICLES!

1581082,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0090SI4HO,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","At first glance, Kim Jee-Woon's ""The Last Stand"" feels a bit like a pity-flick handed to the aging Arnold Schwarzenegger for all his years of service to the industry (not to mention the state of California). Yet, the movie is so happy-go-lucky in its tone and so shamelessly brazen in its goofiness that the viewer actually has a hard time disliking it.Andrew Knauer's rather astonishing everything-but-the-kitchen-sink screenplay features the former governor as the bone-creaking sheriff of a sleepy Arizona border town who's job it becomes to prevent an escaped convict in a turbo-charged race car from using his town as a crossing point into Mexico - something the FBI itself proves incapable of doing.The film seems to exist in two completely separate spheres simultaneously - which is both its biggest charm and its greatest drawback. The sheriff leads a team of bumbling cops and petty criminals - who quite literally can't shoot straight - straight into the eye-teeth of a band of high-tech, take-no-prisoners, armed-to-the-teeth bad guys whose utter ruthlessness makes the Corleone family look like the Waltons. This results in a rather uncomfortable mix of uber-violent action sequences and Keystone Kop buffoonery. The effect is not unlike what one would get if Walter White and Jesse Pinkman were portrayed by Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble. Yet, somehow, at certain moments at least, the crazy thing kind of works, and the audience can't help pulling for it, especially when the movie itself seems as much of a scruffy underdog as the sheriff and his ragtag underlings.Ah well, at least the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and the full-speed-ahead action rarely lets up.",3,absurd action flick that's actually hard to dislike,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,1694,"['first', 'glance', 'Kim', 'Jee-Woon', 'Last', 'Stand', 'bit', 'pity-flick', 'handed', 'aging', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'years', 'service', 'industry', 'not', 'mention', 'state', 'California', 'movie', 'so', 'happy-go-lucky', 'tone', 'so', 'shamelessly', 'brazen', 'goofiness', 'viewer', 'actually', 'hard', 'time', 'disliking', 'it.Andrew', 'Knauer', 'rather', 'astonishing', 'everything-but-the-kitchen-sink', 'screenplay', 'former', 'governor', 'bone-creaking', 'sheriff', 'sleepy', 'Arizona', 'border', 'town', 'who', 'job', 'prevent', 'escaped', 'convict', 'turbo-charged', 'race', 'car', 'using', 'town', 'crossing', 'point', 'Mexico', 'something', 'FBI', 'incapable', 'doing.The', 'film', 'exist', 'two', 'completely', 'separate', 'spheres', 'simultaneously', 'biggest', 'charm', 'greatest', 'drawback', 'sheriff', 'team', 'bumbling', 'cops', 'petty', 'criminals', 'who', 'quite', 'literally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'straight', 'straight', 'eye-teeth', 'band', 'high-tech', 'take-no-prisoners', 'armed-to-the-teeth', 'bad', 'guys', 'utter', 'ruthlessness', 'Corleone', 'family', 'look', 'Waltons', 'results', 'rather', 'uncomfortable', 'mix', 'uber-violent', 'action', 'sequences', 'Keystone', 'Kop', 'buffoonery', 'effect', 'not', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'get', 'Walter', 'White', 'Jesse', 'Pinkman', 'were', 'portrayed', 'Fred', 'Flintstone', 'Barney', 'Rubble', 'somehow', 'certain', 'moments', 'least', 'crazy', 'thing', 'kind', 'works', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'pulling', 'especially', 'when', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'scruffy', 'underdog', 'sheriff', 'ragtag', 'underlings.Ah', 'well', 'least', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'full-speed-ahead', 'action', 'rarely', 'up']",The Last Stand

1581113,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B0090SI4HO,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[2, 3]","Arnold Schwarzenegger promised he'd be back and now he is following his stint as governor of California  In the Last Stand, in his first starring role in nearly a decade, but it isn't all it should be as a comeback vehicle, don't get me wrong, it's good to have the big guy back on the big screen where he belongs, but the Last Stand ends up being only a modest return and a little bit of a disappointment.As a movie, the Last Stand plays as a movie at least a two decades or more out of step with current audiences. It is a modern day western that hits all the lazy western clich&eacute;s. It's actually little more than a contemporary version of Rio Bravo with Arnie as John Wayne and Johnny Knoxville as Walter Brennan, it even has a town drunk who's redeemed by standing tall alongside Schwarzenegger.The movie also couldn't have come at a worst time, with gun control as a hot bed issue. The Last Stand has enough of a pro-gun stance to please any card carrying member of the NRA. Set in an Arizona border town where everyone is packing heat and is either a redneck or a hillbilly.The Last Stand has about three story threads running through it. The first is the already mentioned neo-western starring Arnold. There is also one long continuous car chase involving an escaped fugitive, which looks like a very exciting car commercial, but a somethat boring movie. Then there is the counter point sub plot with Forrest Whitaker as a dogged FBI agent hunting said fugitive and having lots of unconving discourse, this is easily the least satisfying part of the movie.Schwarzenegger plays Ray Owen, a would-be Arizona cowboy who's actually a former L.A. narcotics officer. The role was originally written for Liam Neeson, it should have been written been written for Clint Eastwood. As long as you forget the details easily, like that name, Schwarzenegger actually does a very good job. He's as tough and strong as ever, but is more venerable that a lot of other movie tough guys, no longer a one man army or inhuman machine without feelings. He is still a strong and likable film presence, it's easy to forget just how good a movie star or even a good actor that he really is.It is an enthusiastic occasionally laughable shoot 'em up, but very much a forgettable ""B"" movie. Not completely unsatisfying, but not the triumphant return for Arnold Schwarzenegger. If anything it serves as a fearsome warning that a lot of these aging action stars are not only long in the tooth, but out of touch with contemporary values.The Last Stand is the English language debut of Jee-Won Kim. A South Korean director who's filmography, up to this point, has been very impressive. As  the director of the eerie horror film A Tale of Two Sisters, the brutal revenge thriller I Saw the Devil and the wonderfully giddy fun ""teriyaki style western"" the God, the Bad and the Weird. Jee-won gave lots of hope for this film, but he seems to be stifled by American filmmaking. I sincerely hope that this great talent does not find himself bogged down by formulaic action movies in the way that the equally fine director John Woo was.At least the Last Stand has a mostly game supporting cast including the excellent Spanish actor Eduardo Noriega as the central bad guy, but it is the wonderful Peter Stormare who is the film's main antagonist for the bulk of it's one hundred and three running time speaking with a southern fried American accent via way of Sweden. Also making a brief appearance is Harry Dean Stanton as a cantankerous shotgun wielding old codger. And as we know, no movie with Harry Dean Stanton in it can be all bad.However Johnny Knoxville serves as the unnecessary ""comic relief"" in a humorless role, fortunately he is not as much of a presence as his second billing would indicate. Also very much a sore spot is Luis Guzman, who was once a great character actor, but now just seems to be cast as annoying often cowardly dufases, this being no exception.Relative newcomers Jamie Alexander and Rodrigo Santoro stand out as Schwarzenegger's more serious deputies. Whitaker adds charisma in an undistinguished supporting role, but he is able to spout dialogue like ""a psychopath in a Batmobile"" with a straight face.Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the great movie stars not just of the last thirty years, but of all-time and more than deserves a rightful film comeback, but this is not it. A half backed mostly uninteresting routine action flick. It's not Schwarzenegger's last stand, but if he doesn't choose his future projects more carefully he will continue to show his age in more ways than one. A modest failure in my opinion, but a failure none the less.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",3,not the comeback we had all hoped for,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,4695,"['Arnold',

I am quite frugal when it comes to shelling out my money for 2 hours of entertainment  so I feel I have gotten my moneys worth seeing it on the big screen. There is plenty of old school action done very well, but I was not to crazy about the car chases/stunts. I can suspend belief for alot of things but the Corvette doing a complete 180 at breakneck speeds and continuing in reverse at 70(?) plus miles an hour is too ridiculous and unnecessary. Must have a bullet proof tranny and driveshaft! There was already plenty of cool stuff going on so the movie didn't need that ""Fast and the Furious"" style of automotive stunt work. However the car chase in the cornfield was pretty cool!Arnold plays a likeable guy and the villains are suitably ruthless enough that you want them to meet justice in an ugly way. My date thought the main villain was ""hot"" so of course I was glad to remind her that he was beat up by a 65 year old man. Granted it was a very large 65 year old man.This is the type of movie that will probably find its home next to ""Roadhouse"" on cable TV and I  do not mean that as an insult. Making a good action movie is an art form as legitimate making the next ""Gone with the Wind."" I do not see alot of credible actors that will be able to fill the the shoes of Arnold, Stallone or Chuck Norris . There isn't alot of character development going on in this movie, but at least it isn't paced like a video game(like the Crank movies.)It was good seeing Arnold back on the big screen again.

""The Last Stand"" is the 65-year-old former California governor's first starring vehicle in ten years since ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" but the film is also notable as the Korean director Jee-woon Kim's first Hollywood production. This is an unexpected collaboration - a veteran action star meets a cult filmmaker of ""The Good, the Bad, the Weird"" and ""I Saw the Devil"" - but it works.The story revolves around Ray Owens (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a sheriff of a quiet town of Sommerton, Arizona, and Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega), an escaped federal prisoner and Mexican drug kingpin. The sheriff (who has ""seen enough blood and death"") and a handful of townspeople stand up against the smart and ruthless criminal trying to cross the border, and a group of heavily armed mercenaries.""The Last Stand"" is a modern-day western, with such character actors as Luis Guzm&aacute;n, Peter Stormare, Johnny Knoxville and Harry Dean Stanton (in an uncredited role) doing what they are supposed to do, and they do it very well. Arnold Schwarzenegger looks old, but he still holds his own.The film has a few shortcomings. It takes some time for the story to get moving, and Forest Whitaker's role as FBI agent doesn't fit well in the story, but once action starts, which is bloody, violent and even darkly funny, the film gets entertaining.Like ""The Expendables"" and its sequel, where Arnold Schwarzenegger was briefly seen, ""The Last Stand"" is an old-school action movie with a large amount of shootouts and physical fights.

The highlight of the film is a fantastic car chase through a huge corn field between Arnold and Noriega brilliantly edited by Steven Kemper and photographed by Ji Yong Kim amd is worth the price of the purchase alone making it join the ranks of unique action chases.

The movie trailer did nothing for me except to show that Arnie was back in action. The problem is, I already saw him in Expendables 2, and let's be honest, he's getting a little shaky in his old age.That being said, when the movie became available for viewing on Amazon Prime, I decided to give it a shot.The acting is terrible, by far some of the worst I've seen. But all the characters had charm, even Johnny Knoxville who I'm not a big fan of. It's not that the bad acting is intentional, it's just that, you for some reason like the actors and enjoy their performance. So in a weird way, the movie just didn't really need good acting to begin with.In fact, the action scenes are freaking GREAT! There were a few times that I found myself chuckling because the reveals were just so perfectly well executed. From the big ass machine gun to the awesome shoot out in the town. This movie does not fail to deliver on the action. Also, even though I'm not a car nut, the vehicle stunts in this movie were a hell of a lot of fun to watch.You're definitely not coming into this movie for plot or acting. If you're watching this movie, it's because you want to see s*** get blown up, awesome stunts, funny moments, and Arnie kicking ass. Well if that's the case, this movie doesn't fail to deliver.Now whether you should pay money to rent the movie, well... I'm a little torn. Yes, I enjoyed myself for the most part, but at the same time, the movie left me unsatisfied. The recurring thought in my head was, ""If I paid money for this. I'd be a little disappointed.""If you can rent it for 1.99 or watch it for free, go with those options. It's not worth 2.99 or higher, sorry.",3,Not an utter waste of time like other movies.,1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,1745,"['was', 'one', 'movies', 'had', 'absolutely', 'interest', 'watching', 'movie', 'trailer', 'did', 'nothing', 'show', 'Arnie', 'was', 'back', 'action', 'problem', 'already', 'saw', 'Expendables', '2', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'getting', 'little', 'shaky', 'old', 'age.That', 'being', 'said', 'when', 'movie', 'became', 'available', 'viewing', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'decided', 'give', 'shot.The', 'acting', 'terrible', 'far', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'characters', 'had', 'charm', 'even', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'who', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'not', 'bad', 'acting', 'intentional', 'just', 'reason', 'actors', 'enjoy', 'performance', 'So', 'weird', 'way', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'good', 'acting', 'begin', 'with.In', 'fact', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'freaking', 'GREAT', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'found', 'chuckling', 'reveals', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'perfectly', 'well', 'executed', 'big', 'ass', 'machine', 'gun', 'awesome', 'shoot', 'town', 'movie', 'not', 'fail', 'deliver', 'action', 'Also', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', 'car', 'nut', 'vehicle', 'stunts', 'movie', 'were', 'hell', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch.You', ""'re"", 'definitely', 'not', 'coming', 'movie', 'plot', 'acting', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 's***', 'get', 'blown', 'up', 'awesome', 'stunts', 'funny', 'moments', 'Arnie', 'kicking', 'ass', 'Well', 'case', 'movie', ""n't"", 'fail', 'deliver.Now', 'should', 'pay', 'money', 'rent', 'movie', 'well', ""'m"", 'little', 'torn', 'Yes', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'part', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'left', 'unsatisfied', 'recurring', 'thought', 'head', 'was', 'paid', 'money', ""'d"", 'be', 'little', 'disappointed', 'can', 'rent', '1.99', 'watch', 'free', 'go', 'options', 'not', 'worth', '2.99', 'higher', 'sorry']",The Last Stand

Not only are the action scenes novel and thrilling, but most of them are realistic enough to enjoy.  In fact, Arnold's one major fight incorporates an homage to MMA, wrestling, and real life brawls.  Plus it has a nice twist.Most of the movie had twists that I found delightfully unexpected.  Yes, the plot is basic, but not hackneyed.  I found the movie refreshingly different, funny, and well-acted!  Arnold is stiff, but better than he's been in years.  No cheesy Expendables 2 lines.  Some meaning woven into the dialogue.Yeah, the minor characters could have been developed better.  But Knoxville is at his best, adding quite a bit of comedy relief that never takes away from the plot.  Maybe the worst part is one of the bad guys' accent.  He cannot decide if he is French or Southern.  LOL  Other than that, every actor is on point, delivering both comedic and dramatic lines really well.  I was actually surprised at Arnold's tender moments.  It was like watching a beloved statue come to life.  He's pretty stoic, but it worked.Trust me, this is no copycat Hollywood cheese-fest action flick.  Even though I am usually jaded, I cared about the characters and enjoyed the action--from car chases, to shootouts, to ambushes, to hand to hand.  This was a well-shot, novel, funny, and bloody ball!  Worth buying if you love movies like the last Rambo, Fast and Furious, or Gangster Squad.  Good stuff.",5,Did not expect it to be this good!
