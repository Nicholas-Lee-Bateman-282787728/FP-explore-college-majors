1659273,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B00DMDS54K,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[11, 12]","It is hard to believe that Scott and Bailey is already on its third series. When it hit our screens just two short years ago it was like a breath of fresh air. There are many police procedural programmes on TV these days that the majority of them seem to merge into one, but this programme was sufficiently different that it achieved a good following and further series were assured. Like the second series, this time around we had eight episodes to go with the six in the first series for a total of 22 so far.Janet Scott (Lesley Sharpe) and Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones) are two overworked detectives from the fictional Manchester Metropolitan Police. Although they have a somewhat tempestuous relationship, they are normally best friends. However, they are quite different in character, with Janet being the older, steadier character whilst Rachel is much more volatile although her leaps of imagination are often the factor which provides the breakthrough in difficult crimes.In the third series, Janet and Rachel start off at a low point in their personal relationship, which remains under pressure throughout. Rachel soon has doubts about her recent marriage whilst Janet has yet to fully come to terms with her own break up. Meanwhile an interesting assortment of cases come the team's way, usually involving murder most foul. However, one of the strengths of this series is that, in a departure from the norm, the personal lives of those involved often take centre stage and this is the case for a lot of the time here. It is certainly a valid comment that there are no strong men in Scott an Bailey but personally I do not think this detracts from the entertainment.The last episode was probably the strongest of the series and involved a dramatic kidnapping. There was some excellent acting here, particularly by Gill Murray (Amelia Bullmore) who continues to be an essential element and an excellent foil for the two ladies. I do not think a fourth series has yet been announced but I imagine it is very likely. I certainly hope so as this is a series which is one of the high spots of the UK TV schedule these days.",5,Another Strong Series,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,2127,"['hard', 'believe', 'Scott', 'Bailey', 'already', 'third', 'series', 'When', 'hit', 'screens', 'just', 'two', 'short', 'years', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'are', 'many', 'police', 'procedural', 'programmes', 'TV', 'days', 'majority', 'seem', 'merge', 'one', 'programme', 'was', 'sufficiently', 'different', 'achieved', 'good', 'following', 'further', 'series', 'were', 'assured', 'second', 'series', 'time', 'had', 'eight', 'episodes', 'go', 'six', 'first', 'series', 'total', '22', 'so', 'far.Janet', 'Scott', 'Lesley', 'Sharpe', 'Rachel', 'Bailey', 'Suranne', 'Jones', 'are', 'two', 'overworked', 'detectives', 'fictional', 'Manchester', 'Metropolitan', 'Police', 'have', 'somewhat', 'tempestuous', 'relationship', 'are', 'normally', 'best', 'friends', 'However', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'character', 'Janet', 'being', 'older', 'steadier', 'character', 'whilst', 'Rachel', 'much', 'more', 'volatile', 'leaps', 'imagination', 'are', 'often', 'factor', 'breakthrough', 'difficult', 'crimes.In', 'third', 'series', 'Janet', 'Rachel', 'start', 'off', 'low', 'point', 'personal', 'relationship', 'pressure', 'Rachel', 'soon', 'doubts', 'recent', 'marriage', 'whilst', 'Janet', 'yet', 'fully', 'come', 'terms', 'own', 'break', 'up', 'Meanwhile', 'interesting', 'assortment', 'cases', 'come', 'team', 'way', 'usually', 'involving', 'murder', 'most', 'foul', 'However', 'one', 'strengths', 'series', 'departure', 'norm', 'personal', 'lives', 'involved', 'often', 'take', 'centre', 'stage', 'case', 'lot', 'time', 'here', 'certainly', 'valid', 'comment', 'are', 'strong', 'men', 'Scott', 'Bailey', 'personally', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'detracts', 'entertainment.The', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'probably', 'strongest', 'series', 'involved', 'dramatic', 'kidnapping', 'was', 'excellent', 'acting', 'here', 'particularly', 'Gill', 'Murray', 'Amelia', 'Bullmore', 'who', 'be', 'essential', 'element', 'excellent', 'foil', 'two', 'ladies', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'fourth', 'series', 'yet', 'been', 'announced', 'imagine', 'very', 'likely', 'certainly', 'hope', 'so', 'series', 'one', 'high', 'spots', 'UK', 'TV', 'schedule', 'days']",N/A

Bailey a vary good police person and is excellent at what she does, but her home live is complete mess.  It is like she is two different people on the show.  She does screw up as a police person, but she comes out on top.  Her family life another story.  She doesn't seem to be able to put her own life together away from work,  Scott on the other hand has it all together at home and work.  She is the level headed one of the two.  Between the two theys seem to get the work done, and if is enjoyable watching them.",5,Realistic police show,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",2014,582,"['Great', 'interaction', 'two', 'leading', 'actresses', 'show', 'Bailey', 'vary', 'good', 'police', 'person', 'excellent', 'what', 'home', 'live', 'complete', 'mess', 'two', 'different', 'people', 'show', 'screw', 'up', 'police', 'person', 'out', 'top', 'family', 'life', 'story', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'put', 'own', 'life', 'together', 'away', 'work', 'Scott', 'other', 'hand', 'together', 'home', 'work', 'level', 'headed', 'one', 'two', 'two', 'theys', 'seem', 'get', 'work', 'done', 'enjoyable', 'watching']",N/A

(No, it doesn't actually, but I don't think you want to know whether it ends with a suicide or a terrorist bomb or what).Just watch it!If you like the first two series, you'll love this one; I think it's even better than the others.  They've really hit their stride.  It's more dramatic, both in the personal soap operas and the criminal action, but it's sometimes funny too--there is one really hilarious moment-- which also leads to more dramatic complications.You get to see some things that, if I can put it this way, happened in Season 2 but weren't shown to us-- in other words, some big things that happened, chronologically, before the last thing you saw last year, and kind of explain a few things.If you're wondering whether Rachel really gets married, or what ever happened to the crazy brother, that will all be revealed.In the first two series, I had a mild complaint that there were no  DVD extras; this series has a little &#34;making of&#34; feature, but they needn't have bothered.

1659277,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B00DMDS54K,Richard B. Schwartz,"[3, 3]","Janet Scott and Rachel Bailey are detective constables in a special branch of the Manchester police. Janet is mid-late forties (over the three seasons) and Rachel is in her early thirties. Janet is grounded and Rachel is (in her private life) hyperbolic verging on crazy, particularly in the third season. Each reflects the personality of their respective mothers. While Janet has passed her sergeant's exam there are no vacant DS positions. She is a longstanding friend of their DCI--Gill Murray. (The `Gill' is pronounced Jill.) While Janet and Rachel are the principal characters in the stories, Gill is a very close second. She is crisp, disciplined and no-nonsense, with a salty tongue and a capacity to deliver staccato dialogue which is nearly Shakespearean in its wit, speed and cleverness.The personal lives of the characters are as important as the crimes which they solve, the personal lives constituting a continuing subplot (or is it the primary plot?) In the third season there is a continuing story line that cuts across all eight episodes. It has been compared with other continuing crime dramas such as the very popular series, Broadchurch.The stories are gory, quirky, and as violent as one might expect Manchester capable of providing, but the key elements of each story tend to be the `interview' sessions which Janet and Rachel conduct with the suspects, perps and persons of interest. These are not high-pressure interrogations, but quiet, calm, methodical `interviews' which end up being devastating in their orderliness and effectiveness.The writing is excellent throughout, the atmospherics very good, the performances consistently superb. This is British crime drama of a very high order. It has an obvious female inflection, but the females in this unit command male respect and do things in a way that capitalizes on female strengths and results in the bringing down of bad guys in a slightly more delicate but no less definitive manner.On a more mundane note, the episodes are approximately 45 minutes in length--perfect for quick viewing.Highly recommended.(The above is my review of series 1 and 2 with a look toward series 3.  There is no falling off in quality in series 3, but the personal relationships between the characters become more intense and there is an overarching plot, with most of the season's 8 episodes dealing with a single, nasty case, one in which a grotesque family is welcoming lodgers and then murdering them and burying them in the basement.  SPOILER: there may be some other bodies there and elsewhere as well.)",5,Terrific Series; Don't Miss It,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,2568,"['Janet', 'Scott', 'Rachel', 'Bailey', 'are', 'detective', 'constables', 'special', 'branch', 'Manchester', 'police', 'Janet', 'mid-late', 'forties', 'three', 'seasons', 'Rachel', 'early', 'thirties', 'Janet', 'grounded', 'Rachel', 'private', 'life', 'hyperbolic', 'verging', 'crazy', 'particularly', 'third', 'season', 'personality', 'respective', 'mothers', 'Janet', 'passed', 'sergeant', 'exam', 'are', 'vacant', 'DS', 'positions', 'longstanding', 'friend', 'DCI', 'Gill', 'Murray', 'Gill', 'pronounced', 'Jill', 'Janet', 'Rachel', 'are', 'principal', 'characters', 'stories', 'Gill', 'very', 'close', 'second', 'crisp', 'disciplined', 'no-nonsense', 'salty', 'tongue', 'capacity', 'deliver', 'staccato', 'dialogue', 'nearly', 'Shakespearean', 'wit', 'speed', 'cleverness.The', 'personal', 'lives', 'characters', 'are', 'as', 'important', 'crimes', 'solve', 'personal', 'lives', 'constituting', 'continuing', 'subplot', 'primary', 'plot', 'third', 'season', 'continuing', 'story', 'line', 'eight', 'episodes', 'been', 'compared', 'other', 'continuing', 'crime', 'dramas', 'such', 'very', 'popular', 'series', 'Broadchurch.The', 'stories', 'are', 'gory', 'quirky', 'as', 'violent', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'Manchester', 'capable', 'providing', 'key', 'elements', 'story', 'tend', 'be', 'interview', 'sessions', 'Janet', 'Rachel', 'conduct', 'suspects', 'perps', 'persons', 'interest', 'are', 'not', 'high-pressure', 'interrogations', 'quiet', 'calm', 'methodical', 'interviews', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'devastating', 'orderliness', 'effectiveness.The', 'writing', 'excellent', 'atmospherics', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'consistently', 'superb', 'British', 'crime', 'drama', 'very', 'high', 'order', 'obvious', 'female', 'inflection', 'females', 'unit', 'command', 'male', 'respect', 'do', 'things', 'way', 'female', 'strengths', 'results', 'bringing', 'bad', 'guys', 'slightly', 'more', 'delicate', 'less', 'definitive', 'manner.On', 'more', 'mundane', 'note', 'episodes', 'are', 'approximately', '45', 'minutes', 'length', 'perfect', 'quick', 'viewing.Highly', 'recommended', 'above', 'review', 'series', '1', '2', 'look', 'series', '3', 'falling', 'off', 'quality', 'series', '3', 'personal', 'relationships', 'characters', 'become', 'more', 'intense', 'overarching', 'plot', 'most', 'season', '8', 'episodes', 'dealing', 'single', 'nasty', 'case', 'one', 'grotesque', 'family', 'welcoming', 'lodgers', 'then', 'murdering', 'burying', 'basement', 'SPOILER', 'may', 'be', 'other', 'bodies', 'there', 'elsewhere', 'as', 'well']",N/A
