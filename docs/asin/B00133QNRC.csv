But back when he loved letters, we found this DVD series. We don't watch much tv or movies at home. But I was pregnant and feeling pretty agreeable to do anything that involved anyone else entertaining him that wasn't me. We found Word World and I have to admit not only did he learn how to spell some words and songs, but I was entertained too. I was especially pleased by how positive the series is. Highly recommend. Dog is our favorite character.",4,"Clean, positive, clever, educational fun",1213833600,"06 19, 2008",2008,548,"['son', 'letters', 'alphabet', 'Well', 'used', 'when', 'was', 'two', 'Now', 'Care', 'Bears', 'back', 'when', 'loved', 'letters', 'found', 'DVD', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'much', 'tv', 'movies', 'home', 'was', 'pregnant', 'feeling', 'pretty', 'agreeable', 'do', 'anything', 'involved', 'anyone', 'else', 'entertaining', 'was', ""n't"", 'found', 'Word', 'World', 'have', 'admit', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'learn', 'how', 'spell', 'words', 'songs', 'was', 'entertained', 'too', 'was', 'especially', 'pleased', 'how', 'positive', 'series', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'Dog', 'favorite', 'character']",WordWorld: Lucky Duck
