1101757,ACBTOEVL2CTAQ,B000VIO96C,B. J.,"[1, 1]","One of Jackie Chan's earliest movies and the first one he directed.  It was typical Jackie Chan -- Kung Fu action mixed in with a lot of comedy.  Of course the only drawback was that it doesn't really sound like Jackie, but it was still a good entertaining movie.",4,Fearless Hyena,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,263,"['One', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'earliest', 'movies', 'first', 'one', 'directed', 'was', 'typical', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'action', 'mixed', 'lot', 'comedy', 'course', 'only', 'drawback', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'sound', 'Jackie', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'entertaining', 'movie']",Fearless Hyena

I vaguely remember seeing this on Saturday Morning Kung Fu Theater ages ago, along with so many other really well choreographed classics, and even then I didn't care that the movies were dubbed in English. So, I can't speak Chinese, so what? Jackie is always very expressive, and doggone it, the stunts are AWESOME. The good guy wins, and you just can't help rooting for him. Love these movies, always will, and throughout the years, Jackie Chan just got better and better. Great fun for about an hour and a half- for those of us who love the chop-socky flicks. If you don't love it, then I tell you, in the style of all the greats:You have dishonored my school, and dishonored my family.

Jackie Chan - as usual - is hilarious, and in this one he even appears as a woman to fight a supposed champion.
