1334404,A1H4X50VE4K2W6,B0039YAKYA,"A. D. Bowman ""64panther""","[10, 11]","Winning Time! I watched this documentary when it premiered on ESPN. To be honest, I didn't know what to expect, but, about ten minutes into the presentation, I remembered Reggie Miller. That skinny, brash, trash talking guy out of the California culture, that was selected by The Indiana Pacers instead of Steve Alford. ( The biggest disappointment in Indiana since Larry Bird went to Boston ). As this film will show, Reggie earned his stripes in the tough Eastern Conference of the NBA, where rivalries were more akin to fueds than anything else. The memorable clashes between the Bulls, The Pistons,  The Celtics and of course The Knicks, would be where Reggie would change minds and attitudes, but none of these engagements even come close to the occasions of playing the Patrick Ewing led Knicks. Once I discovered this project was available on DVD, I couldn't wait to see it uninterrupted. The stuff they are passing off today in the NBA, pales in comparison to what you'll see just briefly in this film, and that is the only knock I have on this splendid, informative and elevating film. The interviews with many of the principles confirms that it was more than just a game. These swaggering gentlemen who now find themselves outfitted in the garments of NBA, should be required to watch this piece of league history and maybe aspire to commit to putting a similar excellent representation before their ticket buying public, highly unlikely. However, you can now witness, ( If you weren't there...then ) what all that rumbling was coming out of the NBA Eastern Conference, when the players really knew how to do it....and just for a moment, this kid from The Indiana Pacers became The King Of New York.

1334405,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0039YAKYA,Andy Orrock,"[1, 2]","Dan Klores' ""Winning Time"" ranks as one of the best of ESPN's '30 for 30' series.  It's especially relevant given what has transpired in the NBA over the past couple of weeks: erstwhile rivals colluding to join forces.  Klores' work depicts a now-bygone NBA era of fierce, cutthroat competitiveness.  The thought of, say, Reggie Miller and Patrick Ewing putting friendship before team loyalty was unthinkable in an era in which the shadow of Michael Jordan - a vicious competitive force - set the tone for the league.  This was true even in the two-year hiatus in which Jordan was off trying his hand at baseball (or, was suspended from the league for two years for gambling, if you believe certain sources).Though Reggie Miller was the most unlikely of competitive forces physically (""Mr. Potato Head on a Stick"" as one interviewee indelibly describes him), he, too, possessed the Jordan-esque flair of sticking in the dagger when it counted.  Klores captures that here - and he gets all the protagonists to recall the most compelling sequences in the Pacers-Knicks showdowns, including Miller's now legendary eight points in 8.9 seconds that ended Game 1 in 1995.  As usual, Spike Lee rises to the occasion and gives a great interview.Director Klores is the right man to recount this tale - he's steeped in basketball culture and all things New York - his experiences in creating such works asThe Boys of 2nd Street Park,Crazy LoveandBlack Magicare all relevant here.When reviewing the '30 for 30' series as a whole, there's one standout leader that is simply so far above the rest of the works, it's like it got dropped in from another planet:ESPN Films 30 for 30: The Two Escobars.  That's the best single film of any variety that I've seen in years.  It's Oscar-winning stuff.

It was more fun than anything, since some pretty crazy stuff was going on in basketball during this time period, and that's only emphazied by the great interviews by Director Dan Klores. And what's probably the greatest acheivment of the documentery is that it draws you in despite the fact that almost none of the events mattered in the grand sceme of the NBA, much less their team's history. Sure, they were both perineal contenders, but they never made it into the championship finals, despite having some great talent. But it sure does help when Reggie Miller is such an interesting guy to base your documentery around.Overall, if you're a fan of the Pacers or the Knicks, then you'll treasure it as a tribute to an era when your teams were actually good, and it was as good a shot in 30 years they had for winning a championship, to which they're both still chasing. But even if you're just a basketball fan, or a sport fan, you'll find it compelling enough. You just may not have the same passion and love as the people who actually had a stake back then.

1334410,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0039YAKYA,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Reggie Miller is so skinny he doesn't have a shadow. Reggie Miller is so thin he could slide thru a door without opening it, except that then his elephant ears would get caught in the crack. But Reggie Miller was a phenomenal basketball player, and whenever he laced 'em up in Madison Square Garden, he elevated his game even more, and it became almost like performance art. ESPN, celebrating its 30 years on air, is doing big things with its 30 for 30 documentaries, and this one may be my favorite so far. ""Winning Time: Reggie Miller Vs. The New York Knicks"" sounds like a mouthful, which is absolutely appropriate for Reggie Miller. Reggie can talk, brother. Reggie can trash talk. Prolifically.The film focuses on the Indiana Pacers' very bitter, very heated rivalry with the Knicks back in the mid-'90s, and Reggie, the king of histrionics, was in the thick of things. Everyone respected Reggie's game, but the same can't be said for his constant chatter. Reggie trash talks partly - or maybe mostly - because of his big sister Cheryl, in whose shadow Reggie chafed for a looooong time. There's a funny anecdote in which Reggie, when he was a kid, boasts that he had just scored 40 points only to learn that his sister had just scored 105. Cheryl Miller may just be the best female basketball player ever, and Reggie heard about this all his early life and when he was in UCLA and even during his career as a Pacer. Trash talking can be a self-defense mechanism, and Reggie was a virtuoso of baiting. Even Cheryl describes her little brother as ""a bad itch down your spine that you can't get to."" Patrick Ewing straight out called him a con man. And from another guy in the film: ""The guy looked like Mr. Potatohead on a stick."" But Reggie can back up his lip with his exploits on the court. He is one of the most clutch performers in the history of the game.I'm not even a Pacers fan and I love this documentary (but, okay, I am a UCLA fan). Director Dan Klores knows how to tell a compelling story. Reggie Miller wasn't whom the Indiana fans wanted selected in the draft. They were jonesing for favorite son and Indiana Hoosier, Steve Alford. So right away Reggie had something to prove.New York versus Indiana. The cultural gap is explored. We note the dichotomy of the bustling metropolis versus the leisurely tiny town. New York's slick arrogance had the city dubbing itself the Mecca of basketball, which didn't sit too well with Indiana, a place that reveres the sport and regards itself as THE home of basketball. The film is well-rounded enough that focus is also given to the Knicks' side of things. The Knicks were edgy and old-school rough under Pat Riley's tutelage. Fines were doled out to any Knick who helped up an opponent he'd just knocked down. We get reflections from members of that team and archival interviews, most notably from head coach Pat Riley, Patrick Ewing, and John Starks. And, oh, poor John Starks. Did Reggie ever have fun playing mind games with the volatile John Starks. And then there was Spike Lee, doubtless Reggie's biggest foil.Klores seamlessly weaves archival footage and humorous interviews and rousing music to not only bring to life one of the most rugged rivalries in basketball but to also delve into the psychology of the game. ""Reggie Miller Vs. The New York Knicks"" is a platform for gamesmanship and outrageous egos and audacious feats. It's human drama that is passionate and riveting enough that you don't have to be a sports fan to be entertained. We get to relive Reggie's signature moments in Madison Square Garden: Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals in which a heckling Spike Lee inspired Reggie to an amazing come-from-behind victory, with Reggie directing that famous choke gesture and yet another gesture at Spike. Then the even more miraculous comeback win over the Knicks in Game 1 of the 1995 Eastern Conference Semifinals when, with Indiana trailing by six, Reggie scored 8 points in 8.9 seconds in the closing moments.But as much as this is about Reggie, this is also something of a passing indictment on the Knicks' inability to get over that hump with Patrick Ewing as the focal point. He and Reggie are only two of some of the great basketball players to never have won a championship.Still, with two seconds to go, and your team is down and you need three points, would you rather have Michael Jordan... or Reggie Miller? If those were my only two choices, I'd go with old Mr. Potatohead every time.",5,"""The guy looked like Mr. Potatohead on a stick.""",1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,4486,"['Reggie', 'Miller', 'so', 'skinny', ""n't"", 'have', 'shadow', 'Reggie', 'Miller', 'so', 'thin', 'could', 'slide', 'thru', 'door', 'opening', 'then', 'elephant', 'ears', 'would', 'get', 'caught', 'crack', 'Reggie', 'Miller', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'basketball', 'player', 'whenever', 'laced', 'up', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'elevated', 'game', 'even', 'more', 'became', 'almost', 'performance', 'art', 'ESPN', 'celebrating', '30', 'years', 'air', 'doing', 'big', 'things', '30', '30', 'documentaries', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'favorite', 'so', 'far', 'Winning', 'Time', 'Reggie', 'Miller', 'Vs', 'New', 'York', 'Knicks', 'mouthful', 'absolutely', 'appropriate', 'Reggie', 'Miller', 'Reggie', 'can', 'talk', 'brother', 'Reggie', 'can', 'trash', 'talk', 'Prolifically.The', 'film', 'focuses', 'Indiana', 'Pacers', 'very', 'bitter', 'very', 'heated', 'rivalry', 'Knicks', 'back', ""mid-'90s"", 'Reggie', 'king', 'histrionics', 'was', 'thick', 'things', 'Everyone', 'respected', 'Reggie', 'game', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'constant', 'chatter', 'Reggie', 'trash', 'talks', 'partly', 'maybe', 'mostly', 'big', 'sister', 'Cheryl', 'shadow', 'Reggie', 'chafed', 'looooong', 'time', 'funny', 'anecdote', 'Reggie', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'had', 'just', 'scored', '40', 'points', 'only', 'learn', 'sister', 'had', 'just', 'scored', '105', 'Cheryl', 'Miller', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'best', 'female', 'basketball', 'player', 'ever', 'Reggie', 'heard', 'early', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'UCLA', 'even', 'career', 'Pacer', 'Trash', 'talking', 'can', 'be', 'self-defense', 'mechanism', 'Reggie', 'was', 'virtuoso', 'baiting', 'Even', 'Cheryl', 'little', 'brother', 'bad', 'itch', 'spine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Patrick', 'Ewing', 'straight', 'out', 'called', 'con', 'man', 'guy', 'film', 'guy', 'looked', 'Mr.', 'Potatohead', 'stick', 'Reggie', 'can', 'back', 'up', 'lip', 'exploits', 'court', 'one', 'most', 'clutch', 'performers', 'history', 'game.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'Pacers', 'fan', 'love', 'documentary', 'okay', 'am', 'UCLA', 'fan', 'Director', 'Dan', 'Klores', 'how', 'tell', 'compelling', 'story', 'Reggie', 'Miller', 'was', ""n't"", 'whom', 'Indiana', 'fans', 'wanted', 'selected', 'draft', 'were', 'jonesing', 'favorite', 'son', 'Indiana', 'Hoosier', 'Steve', 'Alford', 'So', 'right', 'away', 'Reggie', 'had', 'something', 'prove.New', 'York', 'versus', 'Indiana', 'cultural', 'gap', 'explored', 'note', 'dichotomy', 'bustling', 'metropolis', 'leisurely', 'tiny', 'town', 'New', 'York', 'slick', 'arrogance', 'had', 'city', 'dubbing', 'Mecca', 'basketball', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'too', 'well', 'Indiana', 'place', 'sport', 'regards', 'THE', 'home', 'basketball', 'film', 'well-rounded', 'enough', 'focus', 'also', 'given', 'Knicks', 'side', 'things', 'Knicks', 'were', 'edgy', 'old-school', 'rough', 'Pat', 'Riley', 'tutelage', 'Fines', 'were', 'doled', 'out', 'Knick', 'who', 'helped', 'up', 'opponent', ""'d"", 'just', 'knocked', 'down', 'get', 'reflections', 'members', 'team', 'archival', 'interviews', 'most', 'notably', 'head', 'coach', 'Pat', 'Riley', 'Patrick', 'Ewing', 'John', 'Starks', 'oh', 'poor', 'John', 'Starks', 'Did', 'Reggie', 'ever', 'have', 'fun', 'playing', 'mind', 'games', 'volatile', 'John', 'Starks', 'then', 'was', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'doubtless', 'Reggie', 'biggest', 'seamlessly', 'weaves', 'archival', 'footage', 'humorous', 'interviews', 'rousing', 'music', 'not', 'only', 'bring', 'life', 'one', 'most', 'rugged', 'rivalries', 'basketball', 'also', 'delve', 'psychology', 'game', 'Reggie', 'Miller', 'Vs', 'New', 'York', 'Knicks', 'platform', 'gamesmanship', 'outrageous', 'egos', 'audacious', 'feats', 'human', 'drama', 'passionate', 'riveting', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'sports', 'fan', 'be', 'entertained', 'get', 'relive', 'Reggie', 'signature', 'moments', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'Game', '5', '1994', 'Eastern', 'Conference', 'Finals', 'heckling', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'inspired', 'Reggie', 'amazing', 'come-from-behind', 'victory', 'Reggie', 'directing', 'famous', 'choke', 'gesture', 'yet', 'gesture', 'Spike', 'Then', 'even', 'more', 'miraculous', 'comeback', 'win', 'Knicks', 'Game', '1', '1995', 'Eastern', 'Conference', 'Semifinals', 'when', 'Indiana', 'trailing', 'six', 'Reggie', 'scored', '8', 'points', '8.9', 'seconds', 'closing', 'moments.But', 'as', 'much', 'Reggie', 'also', 'something', 'passing', 'indictment', 'Knicks', 'inability', 'get', 'hump', 'Patrick', 'Ewing', 'focal', 'point', 'Reggie', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'great', 'basketball', 'players', 'never', 'have', 'won', 'championship.Still', 'two', 'seconds', 'go', 'team', 'down', 'need', 'three', 'points', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'Michael', 'Jordan', 'Reggie', 'Miller', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'choices', ""'d"", 'go', 'old', 'Mr.', 'Potatohead', 'time']",N/A

1334414,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B0039YAKYA,Patrick L. Randall,"[0, 0]","Prior to the 1994 NBA playoffs, the Indiana Pacers were one of the most irrelevant teams in the entire league.  The Pacers were one of the most dominant teams in the old ABA, winning 3 titles (and playing for 2 more) in the league's 9 seasons.  In their first 17 seasons after merging into the NBA, the Pacers made the playoffs only 6 times, losing in the 1st round each time.  Their most notable accomplishment was pushing the Celtics to a full 5 games in 1991.In 1994, it all changed.  Burgeoning superstar, Reggie Miller, had been working for years to improve his game to take the Pacers to the next level.  With other developing talents like Dale Davis, Antonio Davis and Rik Smits, as well as key free agent signings like Haywood Workman and Byron Scott, the Pacers won their first NBA playoff series, a shocking sweep of the Orlando Magic (with Shaq and Penny Hardaway) and then knocked off #1 seed Atlanta in the second round.  That set the stage for the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks.  That series laid the foundation for almost a decade of one of the NBA's fiercest rivalries and the narrative for ""Winning Time"", another of ESPN's 30 for 30 standouts1994 Eastern Conference Finals didn't truly hit its stride until the series was tied 2-2 and Game 5 was played at the historic Madison Square Gardens.  In that game, Reggie Miller took Indiana on a tremendous fourth quarter comeback with a barrage of ridiculous 3-point shots from all over the court.  After each one, he glared at, and trashed talked to, director Spike Lee, a die-hard Knicks fan known for his courtside antics at all games.  The drama that followed the remainder of this series, and many Knicks-Pacers clashes to follow, are entertainingly captured in ""Winning Time"".  It provides background on the two franchises, as well as how Reggie Miller came to be a Pacer and the hard-driven competitor he was.Even with all these classic battles, neither franchise would go on to win a title afterwards.  Nevertheless, it is a slice of NBA history that remains enormously fun to revisit.",4,"For about 7 years, one of the NBA's best rivalries",1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,2080,"['Prior', '1994', 'NBA', 'playoffs', 'Indiana', 'Pacers', 'were', 'one', 'most', 'irrelevant', 'teams', 'entire', 'league', 'Pacers', 'were', 'one', 'most', 'dominant', 'teams', 'old', 'ABA', 'winning', '3', 'titles', 'playing', '2', 'more', 'league', '9', 'seasons', 'first', '17', 'seasons', 'merging', 'NBA', 'Pacers', 'made', 'playoffs', 'only', '6', 'times', 'losing', '1st', 'round', 'time', 'most', 'notable', 'accomplishment', 'was', 'pushing', 'Celtics', 'full', '5', 'games', '1991.In', '1994', 'changed', 'Burgeoning', 'superstar', 'Reggie', 'Miller', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'years', 'improve', 'game', 'take', 'Pacers', 'next', 'level', 'other', 'developing', 'talents', 'Dale', 'Davis', 'Antonio', 'Davis', 'Rik', 'Smits', 'as', 'well', 'key', 'free', 'agent', 'signings', 'Haywood', 'Workman', 'Byron', 'Scott', 'Pacers', 'won', 'first', 'NBA', 'playoff', 'series', 'shocking', 'sweep', 'Orlando', 'Magic', 'Shaq', 'Penny', 'Hardaway', 'then', 'knocked', 'off', '1', 'seed', 'Atlanta', 'second', 'round', 'set', 'stage', 'Eastern', 'Conference', 'Finals', 'New', 'York', 'Knicks', 'series', 'laid', 'foundation', 'almost', 'decade', 'one', 'NBA', 'fiercest', 'rivalries', 'narrative', 'Winning', 'Time', 'ESPN', '30', '30', 'standouts1994', 'Eastern', 'Conference', 'Finals', 'did', ""n't"", 'truly', 'hit', 'stride', 'series', 'was', 'tied', '2-2', 'Game', '5', 'was', 'played', 'historic', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Gardens', 'game', 'Reggie', 'Miller', 'took', 'Indiana', 'tremendous', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'comeback', 'barrage', 'ridiculous', '3-point', 'shots', 'court', 'one', 'glared', 'trashed', 'talked', 'director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'die-hard', 'Knicks', 'fan', 'known', 'courtside', 'antics', 'games', 'drama', 'followed', 'remainder', 'series', 'many', 'Knicks-Pacers', 'clashes', 'follow', 'are', 'entertainingly', 'captured', 'Winning', 'Time', 'background', 'two', 'franchises', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'Reggie', 'Miller', 'came', 'be', 'Pacer', 'hard-driven', 'competitor', 'classic', 'battles', 'franchise', 'would', 'go', 'win', 'title', 'afterwards', 'Nevertheless', 'slice', 'NBA', 'history', 'enormously', 'fun', 'revisit']",N/A

""fluxus""","[0, 0]","To my mind, no other rivalry and no other time period in professional basketball is likely to match the interest and intensity of the 1990's Pacers vs. Knicks.  This documentary gives a really enjoyable and engaging look into the characters involved, particularly Reggie.  It gives some backdrop on the major storylines, too.  The personalities are really engaging and the drama is lived all over again, the glories and the agonies.I certainly wish that it was a bit longer and would have branched out to incorporate some of the later match-ups, but that would have also stretched the cast of characters somewhat.  I can understand the reasons for focusing on the years selected, but some broader incorporation of later events in the rivalry would have been appreciated and filled in the picture more fully.Still, I am very pleased with this documentary.  For me, Reggie was my sports idol and these series are some of my favorite sports memories.  I'm glad that so many others also have a fondness for this era and this rivalry.  These games really did mean a lot to the teams and their fans.  It shows here.  I wish there was more of that intensity left in the game today.I have watched this, as well, with people who really had no experience with the rivalry or the NBA and they have also found it to be very entertaining and interesting.It's a great keepsake for fans and good entertainment.

To avoid adding a redundant review, I'll skip the specifics on the sufficiently covered subject matter and advise you, the potential customer, that this is one of the finest documentaries I've seen in any genre.  Thus, first and foremost, I would recommend it to any sports fan.  Flat out.  Reggie orchestrated some jaw-dropping performances under the muse of adversities only he could attract and the grind of this process unfolds beautifully in this 30 for 30.  NBA basketball is represented well here.But what's more important to me is that, ""Winning Time"" should be watched by anyone who loves documentaries.  You don't need to be a basketball fan to be enchanted by this project.  I've been watching docs religiously for years on years and I know when one feels right.  The flow is smooth, the interviews are sharp, the characters are inviting, and the drama is thick.
