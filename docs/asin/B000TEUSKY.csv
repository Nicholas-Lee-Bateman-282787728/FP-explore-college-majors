1089235,A3BG43VR1XOTB5,B000TEUSKY,"Aquinas ""summa""","[1, 2]","Very enyoyable, 21 April 2010I watched these series with a gap of about 2 years between series 1 and 2. My impression was that series 1 was more interesting as there was a greater variety of charathers whereas series 2 was overshadowed by the amusing Tim, whose ego was as big as his frame. The scenery is really lovely but there are annoying features, namely the obsessive Machismo, the personifcation by the charachters of the mountain and the frequent recapitulations which must have preceded and followed commercial breaks. Even so, it is all very enjoyable and one really wants to know who will summit. Clearly these guys have extrordinary self-discipline in this context but I wondered to myself whether this self-discipline was reflected in other parts of their lives. As the Dane rightly put it, his bigger challenge was his forthcoming marriage and in that he was spot on. Climbimg everest is about a dialogue with oneslef - there is something more majestic about making a sucess out of a marriage where the dialogue is with another person rather than with myself battling a mountain!",4,very enjoyable,1271808000,"04 21, 2010",2010,1093,"['Very', 'enyoyable', '21', 'April', '2010I', 'watched', 'series', 'gap', '2', 'years', 'series', '1', '2', 'impression', 'was', 'series', '1', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'was', 'greater', 'variety', 'charathers', 'whereas', 'series', '2', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'amusing', 'Tim', 'ego', 'was', 'as', 'big', 'frame', 'scenery', 'really', 'lovely', 'are', 'annoying', 'features', 'namely', 'obsessive', 'Machismo', 'personifcation', 'charachters', 'mountain', 'frequent', 'recapitulations', 'must', 'have', 'preceded', 'followed', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'Even', 'so', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'really', 'know', 'who', 'will', 'summit', 'Clearly', 'guys', 'have', 'extrordinary', 'self-discipline', 'context', 'wondered', 'myself', 'self-discipline', 'was', 'reflected', 'other', 'parts', 'lives', 'Dane', 'rightly', 'put', 'bigger', 'challenge', 'was', 'forthcoming', 'marriage', 'was', 'spot', 'Climbimg', 'everest', 'dialogue', 'oneslef', 'something', 'more', 'majestic', 'making', 'sucess', 'marriage', 'where', 'dialogue', 'person', 'rather', 'battling', 'mountain']",Everest: Beyond the Limit

1089237,A18XKEUEXECLRI,B000TEUSKY,"mcerner ""mcerner""","[7, 14]","I purchased this with high hopes of seeing a dramatic presentation on the effort and details on climbing Everest, with spectacular views of the region and some information too about the Sherpas who make a living guiding good and bad climbers up the mountainside.  The views and the Sherpas are here, but the focus is almost completely on the people and their personalities.  I got bored in the first episode and it went downhill for me afterwards.  Lots of worrying, grandstanding, sorrowing, and so on.  Very emotional at times, but again, not much about the climbing or climbing techniques.  Not informative but perhaps best described as a passionate human-interest story.",3,"Uninteresting, focus on climbers not on climb",1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,674,"['purchased', 'high', 'hopes', 'seeing', 'dramatic', 'presentation', 'effort', 'details', 'climbing', 'Everest', 'spectacular', 'views', 'region', 'information', 'too', 'Sherpas', 'who', 'make', 'living', 'guiding', 'good', 'bad', 'climbers', 'mountainside', 'views', 'Sherpas', 'are', 'here', 'focus', 'almost', 'completely', 'people', 'personalities', 'got', 'bored', 'first', 'episode', 'went', 'downhill', 'afterwards', 'Lots', 'worrying', 'grandstanding', 'sorrowing', 'so', 'Very', 'emotional', 'times', 'again', 'not', 'much', 'climbing', 'climbing', 'techniques', 'Not', 'informative', 'perhaps', 'best', 'described', 'passionate', 'human-interest', 'story']",Everest: Beyond the Limit

The way it is presented is unbelievable.This is a really good program that shows what it really means to climb Mt. Everest. We don't really realize what this men go through and all the preparation that is needed until we see this program. I really liked it and would really recommend it to anyone that is planning to make climbing their sport. As for myself, I've already climbed 3 mountains in Mexico!!",5,Awesome series!!,1252627200,"09 11, 2009",2009,464,"['series', 'as', 'well', 'second', 'season', 'simply', 'awesome', 'way', 'presented', 'unbelievable.This', 'really', 'good', 'program', 'what', 'really', 'climb', 'Mt', 'Everest', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'realize', 'what', 'men', 'go', 'preparation', 'needed', 'see', 'program', 'really', 'liked', 'would', 'really', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'planning', 'make', 'climbing', 'sport', ""'ve"", 'already', 'climbed', '3', 'mountains', 'Mexico']",Everest: Beyond the Limit
1089239,A185QFJRTB5W93,B000TEUSKY,"TrailsEndWild ""Writer/Researcher""","[7, 7]","Everest: BTL is an amazing DVD that captures the drama of a diverse group of climbers and their attempt to summit Everest.  While not technically exhaustive, the DVD is presented in more of a ""reality show"" format that draws you into the human struggle of the ascent.  The DVD focuses on both the strengths and the weaknesses of the men who are attempting to summit the greatest mountain on Earth.  That being said, ANY CLIMBER who has ever stepped foot on a mountain knows that many treks (ESPECIALLY EVERST) have been corrupted into purely commercial ""events"".  However, to focus on that aspect and miss the larger picture is the sign of an unrealistic, mountaineering mind.  We can't go back in time and change what these types of climbs have become.  Accept it and move forward.  Some can, some can't...just like climbing the mountain.  It needs to be said however, that each and every man and woman who place their feet on Everest have already proved everything they need to prove.  As far as the dead climber (Sharp) controversy, it should be noted that there was nothing these men could do that would have saved that poor soul that wouldn't have also cost their own lives.  Not worth it.  Each person knows the score when attempting Everest.  This is nothing compared to the tragedy of the 1996 expedition.  I would suggest that those who are overly concerned about this aspect of the 2006 expedition have never faced true tragedy in their lives or been in unique, ""team-centered"" experiences (such as combat) where the survival of the group is paramount.  While in safe, secure, civilized society we would all do everything in our power to save a human life, combat and an ""assault"" on Everest are different scenarios where (unfortunately) different rules apply.  Overall, outstanding presentation.  The avid climber will find enough here to keep them interested and have them trying on their boots and dusting off their gear in the off-season.
