1060586,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000NVI0DU,Artist & Author,"[1, 2]","Simply put, The Sin Eater is what a Christian movie should be.  I have more than 2,700 DVD movies related in some way with children and teens, and this one comes in very, very near the top.  One of my pet peeves is so-called Christian movies that preach their way through the story, or that try to ram Christianity down one's 'throat,' apparently because the producers think it would be their only chance to convert you.  This movie is completely free of any kind of preaching.  Any attempt to convert anyone is by example, not preaching.The 'Stranger' does say a prayer, but it is done clearly to draw Cadi's attention.  [He is unaware of her presence, but what he is saying peaks Cadi's curiosity about him.]  Wisely, the stranger first shows genuine (and, to her, unexpected) concern about what is troubling Cadi so.  When she explains that she needs a sineater now, not after she is dead, Stranger explains to her that she can let the Original 'Sineater' take that pain from her.  The name of Jesus is mentioned only once, and it's only when Cadi asks if the Original Sineater had a name.  In other words, he brought the Christian message to her on her terms and understanding.Some have complained that it didn't seem realistic that the whole little society would become Christians through what a little girl brought to them.  However, in 1910 a single copy of the Gospel of John fell into the hands of the Hmar people in a remote region of India, and the whole village converted, without even a missionary to teach them.  See ""Beyond the Next Mountain"" for that true story on DVD.Another important element of this movie is that it is quite compelling and entertaining.  A neighbor watched my copy of the DVD, and he and his wife couldn't even answer the phone when it rang as they watched the movie, they were so captivated by the story.  It is a very emotional movie, and many will find a lump in their throat and a wisp of tears in their eyes as they relate to the indescribable pain Cadi feels as a result of her 'sin.'  Every person of religious faith I've shown this movie to comes away saying it is one of the very best movies with a (subtle) Christian message they've ever seen.If your little girl likes this movie, I'd recommend another movie entitled ""Second Chances,' starring: Kelsey Mulrooney, Terry Moore and Directed by: James Fargo.  [As I write this, Amazon.com carries is, and it is available from 24 associated Amazon.com sellers.]The Sin Eater easily comes in among the top five of my DVD collection of movies for or about children and teens.",5,What a 'Christian' Movie should Be,1193443200,"10 27, 2007",2007,2566,"['Simply', 'put', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'what', 'Christian', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'have', 'more', '2,700', 'DVD', 'movies', 'related', 'way', 'children', 'teens', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'top', 'One', 'pet', 'peeves', 'so-called', 'Christian', 'movies', 'preach', 'way', 'story', 'try', 'ram', 'Christianity', 'one', ""'throat"", 'apparently', 'producers', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'chance', 'convert', 'movie', 'completely', 'free', 'kind', 'preaching', 'attempt', 'convert', 'anyone', 'example', 'not', 'preaching.The', ""'Stranger"", 'say', 'prayer', 'done', 'clearly', 'draw', 'Cadi', 'attention', 'unaware', 'presence', 'what', 'saying', 'peaks', 'Cadi', 'curiosity', ']', 'Wisely', 'stranger', 'first', 'genuine', 'unexpected', 'concern', 'what', 'troubling', 'Cadi', 'so', 'When', 'sineater', 'now', 'not', 'dead', 'Stranger', 'can', 'let', 'Original', ""'Sineater"", 'take', 'pain', 'name', 'Jesus', 'mentioned', 'only', 'once', 'only', 'when', 'Cadi', 'Original', 'Sineater', 'had', 'name', 'other', 'words', 'brought', 'Christian', 'message', 'terms', 'understanding.Some', 'have', 'complained', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realistic', 'whole', 'little', 'society', 'would', 'become', 'Christians', 'what', 'little', 'girl', 'brought', 'However', '1910', 'single', 'copy', 'Gospel', 'John', 'fell', 'hands', 'Hmar', 'people', 'remote', 'region', 'India', 'whole', 'village', 'converted', 'even', 'missionary', 'teach', 'See', 'Next', 'Mountain', 'true', 'story', 'DVD.Another', 'important', 'element', 'movie', 'quite', 'compelling', 'entertaining', 'neighbor', 'watched', 'copy', 'DVD', 'wife', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'answer', 'phone', 'when', 'rang', 'watched', 'movie', 'were', 'so', 'captivated', 'story', 'very', 'emotional', 'movie', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'lump', 'throat', 'wisp', 'tears', 'eyes', 'relate', 'indescribable', 'pain', 'Cadi', 'result', ""'sin"", 'Every', 'person', 'religious', 'faith', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'movie', 'away', 'saying', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'movies', 'subtle', 'Christian', 'message', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.If', 'little', 'girl', 'likes', 'movie', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'entitled', 'Second', 'Chances', 'starring', 'Kelsey', 'Mulrooney', 'Terry', 'Moore', 'Directed', 'James', 'Fargo', 'write', 'Amazon.com', 'available', '24', 'associated', 'Amazon.com', 'sellers', ']', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'easily', 'top', 'five', 'DVD', 'collection', 'movies', 'children', 'teens']",The Last Sin Eater

1060590,A1OVYZPXPB0RKB,B000NVI0DU,"C.J. Darlington ""Author of Thicker Than Blood...","[96, 100]","Based on the best-selling novel by Francine Rivers, The Last Sin Eater movie is a faithful adaptation, beautifully capturing the novel's theme of redemption.Set in 1850's Appalachia, this is the story of ten-year-old Cadi Forbes, a young girl wracked with guilt and longing for her mother's love. Can she ever be forgiven for what she's done? When her beloved Granny dies at the film's beginning the ""passing bell"" is rung, and Cadi is told the Sin Eater will come at nightfall to take away Granny's sins. Above all, she must not look at the Sin Eater. If she does, some of the sins he carries could spill over onto her. But as any curious girl would, Cadi can't help looking into the mysterious and dreadful man's eyes. Who is the Sin Eater? Why is he shunned by the entire community? And can he take away her sins now?Though filmed in Utah, you'll be hard pressed not to believe every scene took place in the Appalachians. It's noteworthy cast features newcomer Liana Liberato (Cadi) who steals the show with her fresh-faced innocence and her ability to portray a broad spectrum of emotions. Stuart Finley-McLennan isn't the healer he was as Dr. McNeil in the Christy television series, but in this movie he's the one inflicting damage as villain Brogan Kai. Henry Thomas is probably most well-known for his role as Elliott in E.T., but he wonderfully captures the man of God character in this movie. The scenes he shares with Cadi are some of the films most touching moments.Definitely a family-friendly movie it is surprisingly rated PG-13, though it seemed closer to a PG. Michael Landon, Jr. himself suggests parents watch the film before showing it to young children. This is due to a scene where a man is beaten to death (we see it mostly from a distance) and a massacre later on, although shown with restraint, is still disturbing. Death is a big issue as well giving the film a somewhat dark flavor.Francine Rivers had final approval of the movie, and she was thrilled with Landon's and co-writer Brian Bird's interpretation. Says Francine, ""I knew from meeting them and hearing about what they believed that they would keep the Gospel at the center, which was my main thing. They really stuck to that and kept the heart of the story. I'm very pleased with what they've done."" The most notable change in adapting the book to film is the absence of Cadi's brother Iwan, but the others are minor and understandable. Taken as a whole it's clear staying true to the book was important. The small budget (reportedly 2.2 million) is only evident in the tree bridge shots, which obviously used green screens.Reminiscent of the Christy series in setting and tone, The Last Sin Eater makes the Good News compelling. Through Cadi's heart-wrenching journey we are gently shown what redemption is all about--love and forgiveness. And refreshingly, the Gospel isn't apologized for. It's clearly presented without hitting you over the head.Enriching and uplifting, The Last Sin Eater is what a Christian film should be.--Reviewed by C.J.

1060591,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B000NVI0DU,C. Long,"[1, 1]","Positives:1) Well made, without a lot of the ""cheesy"" acting you find in some Christian films.  Visuals, directing, music score, and acting all good.2) Unusual, unique story that will likely hold your interest, even if it does get a bit predictable in places.  It was honestly more entertaining than I expected it to be.Concerns:1) I didn't change my rating of the film for this, but it is worthwhile information to know: The story is darker than I expected with violence that I really don't believe is appropriate for younger viewers - especially the violence against the children.  This is NOT ""family friendly"" if your family has children under 13 IMO.  Its PG-13 rating is probably pretty accurate.2) The ""conversion"" scene, the most critical to the movie, to be honest really bothered me because it was so watered down.  The girl supposedly believed in Jesus and ""received"" His forgiveness and I guess by extension supposedly ""accepted"" Him, yet she didn't even know His name until after-the-fact.  The Bible says that faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.  Yet, in this most critical scene of the movie, the preacher/missionary forgoes reading from the Bible or using the Bible to plainly tell her about Jesus (he starts by reading it but not really using it to plainly teach her) and instead merely has her recount her sin.  There's no real discussion of who Jesus is (beyond a one-liner or so) - no mention of really discussing why there is sin and a need for Jesus - why it was final - why there is no more need for a ""sin eater"", etc.  In other words, she really didn't hear much to even have a basis for having any faith in Jesus...which the last time I checked my Bible was an important part of the conversion process.This would have been much more effective if the preacher, after realizing he wasn't reaching her with his stoic reading from the Bible, instead just simplified his approach by explaining the Scriptures in plain English that the girl COULD understand by meeting her on her level, rather than doing what he did which seemed to be to just set aside the Word of God altogether.This was the critical scene to the movie and the key part was over in a VERY short period of time, without nearly the expounding needed to really make the connection to Jesus as the ultimate ""sin eater"".Update 06/2014: I re-watched this movie last night and while my concerna above stand, I think I may have been a bit too harsh.  I did notice a scene I don't think I initially caught after the initial conversion where it was implied (not shown) that the missionary did spend some time explaining the Bible for another character.  Also, I must say, I just plain enjoyed the movie - more so I think than on my first watch a few years back.  I would probably now rate this film as 4 stars, not 3.  This movie is a good showcase of how we all need forgiveness in our lives and need a ""sin eater"" and the story was unique and entertaining.  And though they don't really expound on it much at all, it is at least shown that Jesus is the ""sin eater"" we need.Chris LongMovies For Christians Movie Reviewsmoviesforchristians [dot] org",3,NOT a family film for younger viewers!

She really made Cadi Forbes a very believablecharacter. I also enjoyed the music in the film, as well, as some of the scenery. I would not recommend this for younger children, maybe ten and under. It was a little spooky at times, but not in a horror film kind of way. It was mostly just the subject matter of death, and the graveyard scenes that might be scary for some kids.

1060595,A3HYCGZ5CKCZIH,B000NVI0DU,"G. T. Howell ""neogalahad""","[7, 7]","""The Last Sin Eater"", based on the Francine Rivers novel, is a wonderful tale of redemption set in 1850's Appalachia.  I loved the book (which I have also reviewed), and found this movie to be a mostly faithful and enjoyable adaptation.Liana Liberato delivers a great performance as Cadi, a young girl seeking release from the weight of guilt that has burdened her since the death of her little sister.  Elizabeth Lackey, who plays Cadi's mother, does a great job, too -- they have one scene together at the end that just about had me bawling.  The rest of the cast is good as well, especially Peter Wingfield as the title character.  His role was very challenging; since his face is hidden until the last few moments, he has only his voice with which to move us, and move us he does.My only disappointment with the film was that it didn't do as good a job of telling the story as I would have liked.  I watched the movie with my parents and found myself having to explain a few plot points.  For example, when Cadi overhears her father say to her mother, ""So you wish Cadi had died instead?"" my parents thought ""instead"" meant ""instead of Cadi's grandmother"", who had passed away in the opening scene.  A few of the other subtleties of the story could have been fleshed out a bit, too.  At times it felt hurried, and would have benefited from a slightly longer run time.  For example, I would like to have learned a little bit more about the Man of God and what motivated him to enter the remote valley.The Gospel as presented here is somewhat brief, although to the film's credit it does make it clear that 1)we need to be sorry for our sins and 2) only Jesus can grant forgiveness.""The Last Sin Eater"" makes for excellent family viewing and I heartily recommend it.

1060596,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B000NVI0DU,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[1, 1]","There is plenty of reviews to tell you about the movie.  Just additional accolades here. We bought it knowing it was based upon a book by Francine Rivers. My wife and I have never been disappointed with any of her books--thus we purchased the DVD. We also own the book, The last Sin Eater by Rivers. Both are 5 stars. Books and movies are never exactly the same, books provide more story but take longer to read than viewing a movie. Book lovers, alas, always complain about what was left out. This movie stands on it's own.Director, writer, and producer Michael Landon, Jr. has done an outstanding job of creating a thrilling story without shying away from the Biblical truth it holds. Jesus Christ was the Last Sin Eater, and the poor chap chosen by the mountain neighborhood to sacrifice his own soul on their behalf was false and unnecessary. Some of the negative reviews on this movie may have come from viewers convicted by the underlying truth. As a Christian, I did not find the religious emphasis strong or out of place.Most movies I can watch and set aside for a few years before reviewing the same story.  Not this one. It is special.  I was ready to watch again immediately. My only complaint is that the extra features ran out before I was tired of watching all that was included in The Last Sin Eater DVD.This is a breathe of fresh air to contemporary cinema as much as the unveiling of truth and the false need of the sin eater was to the story's characters.  A fine book/movie for every sinner, and the story explains everyone is a sinner.  It takes the younger generation and a murdered man of God in this Welsh community to expose the truth.  Cadi, a courageous young girl in the story leads the way.Excuse me now, while I do an Amazon search for more from Michael Landon Jr. and Francine Rivers.",5,ONE OF THE BEST I'VE WATCHED THIS YEAR.,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,1814,"['plenty', 'reviews', 'tell', 'movie', 'Just', 'additional', 'accolades', 'here', 'bought', 'knowing', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'Francine', 'Rivers', 'wife', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'disappointed', 'books', 'thus', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'also', 'own', 'book', 'last', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'Rivers', 'are', '5', 'stars', 'Books', 'movies', 'are', 'never', 'exactly', 'same', 'books', 'provide', 'more', 'story', 'take', 'longer', 'read', 'viewing', 'movie', 'Book', 'lovers', 'alas', 'always', 'complain', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'movie', 'own.Director', 'writer', 'producer', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Jr.', 'done', 'outstanding', 'job', 'creating', 'thrilling', 'story', 'shying', 'away', 'Biblical', 'truth', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'was', 'Last', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'poor', 'chap', 'chosen', 'mountain', 'neighborhood', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'soul', 'behalf', 'was', 'false', 'unnecessary', 'negative', 'reviews', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'viewers', 'convicted', 'underlying', 'truth', 'Christian', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'religious', 'emphasis', 'strong', 'place.Most', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'set', 'aside', 'few', 'years', 'reviewing', 'same', 'story', 'Not', 'one', 'special', 'was', 'ready', 'watch', 'again', 'immediately', 'only', 'complaint', 'extra', 'features', 'ran', 'out', 'was', 'tired', 'watching', 'was', 'included', 'Last', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'DVD.This', 'breathe', 'fresh', 'air', 'contemporary', 'cinema', 'as', 'much', 'unveiling', 'truth', 'false', 'need', 'sin', 'eater', 'was', 'story', 'characters', 'fine', 'book/movie', 'sinner', 'story', 'everyone', 'sinner', 'younger', 'generation', 'murdered', 'man', 'God', 'Welsh', 'community', 'expose', 'truth', 'Cadi', 'courageous', 'young', 'girl', 'story', 'way.Excuse', 'now', 'do', 'Amazon', 'search', 'more', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Jr.', 'Francine', 'Rivers']",The Last Sin Eater
1060597,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B000NVI0DU,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[22, 36]","The Last Sin Eater. Starring Louise Fletcher, Henry Thomas, Soren Fulton, A.J. Buckley, Stewart Finlay-McLennan, Peter Wingfield, Elizabeth Lackey, Thea Rose, Gabrielle Fitzpatrick, and introducing Liana Liberato. Music by Mark McKenzie. Cinematography by Robert Seaman. Screenplay by Brian Bird and Michael Landon, Jr., based on the novel by Francine Rivers. Edited and directed by Michael Landon, Jr. (FoxFaith, 2007, Color, 141 minutes. MPAA Rating: PG-13).Another costume drama, The Last Sin Eater tells a tale of redemption strikingly similar to Pan's Labyrinth through its heroine, another girl on the cusp of adolescence and responsibility of adulthood. They also share a similar plot structure (the ordeal) and even the same stock characters. However, the two are worlds apart.The fledgling FoxFaith line of inspirational Christian movies released this picture. To me, it's kind of ""made for TV"" filmmaking that's like the proverbial fingernails dragged down the chalkboard: Awkward, dramatically inconsistent performances (especially among the children actors); uneven pacing and slack editing; generic-looking costumes and sets; inter-cutting of 35mm location shots with what appears to be 16mm stock footage; and, a director who uses embarrassingly primitive special effects like ""Chroma-Key"" bluescreen process, which Alfred Hitchcock deemed obsolete as long ago as 1962, when he made his terror classic The Birds. Dismissed by most reviewers, don't hold your breath waiting for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences to bestow its cherished imprimatur upon this ""nice try"" by a director whom the producers should have barred from the editing room.And, although readers might think I'm gearing up to ""pan"" another film (pun intended), think twice. Why? Because, since I was a kid, I don't watch movies simply to revel in their technical merits. I go because I want to be entertained, perhaps even enlightened, by a great story.The technically virtuosic Pan's Labyrinth left me cold because it was all style and no substance. Yet, despite its glaring aesthetic deficits, I loved this one precisely because it had the crucial ingredient the former lacked: A great story. More so than its message, a movie's story is its soul.The Last Sin Eater takes place in a Welsh settlement in 1850s Appalachia. Ten year-old Cadi Forbes (Liana Liberato) hides a dark secret that weighs heavy on her conscience. She tries hard to repress it, but an incident at her grandmother's funeral reopens the barely-healed wound.At her burial, something's horribly amiss: The ceremony, bereft of comforting eulogy, seems more of a witch's sabbath than a passing onto the next life. Held under the cover of darkness, Cadi's granny lies in state before the silent mourners, a piece of bread and a bladder full of wine lying on her chest.Cutting through the eerie stillness, a hooded figure appears, the Sin Eater (Peter Wingfield). He scarfs down the bread and gulps the wine, and in a sorrowful voice--having cleansed the old woman's sins by condemning his own soul--recites a solemn wish for her forgiveness. No one looks at or speaks to the Sin Eater (it's rumored that the very act of communicating with the wretched outcast brings eternal damnation) but while everyone's heads are gravely bowed, Cadi hears something painful yet oddly benign in his voice. She doesn't fear looking into his eyes, because she already feels doomed by her transgression.Cadi's identification with the Sin Eater soon becomes an obsession: Unable to live with herself, a couple days later she seeks him out. She goes into the mountains to find him, despite others' warnings.Here is real heroism: Cadi's refusal to heed superstitious gossip and deny the evidence of her own experience buttresses her resolve to forge on in her quest. We soon learn her secret--her sister's accidental death, by falling off a tree bridge over a waterfall--was prompted, partly, by Cadi's stubbornness. However, her very intransigence is also the key to her eventual redemption.Around this point, the plot comes to a standstill as it meanders. Unable to take the clumsy dialogue of the three child actors, I get ready to exit the theater. Only one thing keeps me pinned in my seat: What will happen next?Cadi eventually tracks down the Sin Eater to his secret cave, he reluctantly performs the sin eating rite, never having done it for a living person. She feels nothing, and descends the mountain just as encumbered as she was going up.On her way home, she happens upon a Man of God (Henry Thomas) alone and preaching the gospel to no one in particular along the river. Seeing that she's troubled, he gets her to open up about her predicament. He laughs, and divulges to Cadi that the mortal Sin Eater cannot relieve her guilt, that long ago there was a true sin eater named Jesus Christ, whose grace has made it possible for her to be forgiven for her sins while still alive, rather than having to wear them like an albatross around her neck until death.Suddenly, Cadi feels the weight of the world lifted from her shoulders. She runs to tell everyone. ""Know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.""But now the mystery has just begun. Why is the immigrant enclave ignorant of this common knowledge of Christ's salvation? Why must a doomed man endure ostracism, serving a miserable sentence performing atavistic pagan rituals?  And why does village bully Brogan Kai (Stewart Finlay-McLennan, whose thuggish performance recalls Ward Bond and George Kennedy) corner the Man of God, killing this ""outsider,"" lest his words reach the village?As Cadi hides from Brogan, she returns to the mountain, where we find out the settlers' real sin, a secret that's haunted two generations. Cadi tells the Sin Eater the good news, but he's unable to accept the tragic fate of having been denied the love of the woman he loved, fathering children and a purposeful, fulfilling life for naught. His agony resonates deeply as he begs her off. ""It means I will have wasted twenty years of my life in this cave and never saved a single soul from damnation,"" he cries, breaking down.Being an old-fashioned movie, Louise Fletcher (best known for her Oscar-winning role of sadistic Nurse Ratched in 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) as village elder Miz Elda is the movie's Deux ex machina, who calls a town meeting that night to divulge the secret. Her testimony opens up a lot of old wounds, but, rather than burning the village to the ground a la avenging angel Clint Eastwood in his 1973 revenge fantasy High Plains Drifter, Elda's words instead lift the shadows of superstition and scapegoating that kept them in darkness.The Sin Eater renounces his dark avocation, becomes a preacher and saves souls instead in the sunlight by the river. The movie closes with Cadi exclaiming its moral, that she's been set free because Christ died for her sins. Not very subtle, but consider the context and target audience.But, that audience already knows that bit of information. The moral was a rather ingenious MacGuffin for a life-affirming message that sin is an aberration, not man's constant state and a this-worldly metaphysics that individuals have the inherent right and dignity to live as men, not objects of sacrifice. In other words, ""Jesus died for our sins, so now we can all get on with the business of living.""Maybe it's not just the sex, moral decadence and profanity driving the faithful to these new religious pictures. From the looks of this one, maybe it's not only preaching to the choir, either. Perhaps, just like everyone else staying away in droves from movie theaters nowadays, they too just want to see motion pictures that tell fascinating stories, project a benevolent sense of life and present man as clean, heroic, and productive.And maybe, just maybe, they're getting fed-up with being patronized as unsophisticated rubes for wanting everybody to live--horror of horrors--happily ever

At the funeral, she is warned that the Sin Eater will visit her grandmother's body and she is instructed not to look.Interesting, so far.

The sin eater was someone in the community, picked by God through lottery, who was set apart to live alone, and only showed up at the burial site to perform a ritual of taking the dead person's sins upon himself, making the person acceptable to God in the afterlife. No one ever saw the Sin Eater. The story centers around young Cadi Forbes, whose sister died recently in an accident, and the guilt she feels for her death. She can't stand living with the guilt and can't wait until death to have her sins removed , so she seeks this elusive and strange person called the Sin Eater. In doing so, she confronts the demons and dark secrets that have haunted the community for decades. Who is this mysterious Sin Eater, where does he live and can he remove the sins of the living as well as the dead? While the film has a clear Christian message, it is intended for all audiences and is more than just an excuse to make a 'video sermon'. The story is well done, the scenery is gorgeous and the acting is more than adequate, all done on a relatively small budget. Reading the book is a plus in understanding as it would be helpful to have a little better knowledge of the role of the Sin Eater and the cause of Cadi's guilt a little earlier in the film. Produced as part of the FoxFaith Series. It will be over the head of and a little too violent for most children under 13.

Zwick,"[11, 28]","According to ancient Celtic tradition, a ""sin eater"" is a person chosen by lottery to take the transgressions of others onto his soul so that the newly deceased can pass over to the great-beyond free of the stain of iniquity.""The Last Sin Eater,"" the latest offering from FoxFaith Films (the branch of Twentieth Century Fox Studios that specializes in Christian-friendly moviemaking) is a well-meaning but leaden and strangely eclectic work, sort of ""The Village"" meets ""The Old Time Gospel Hour"" meets ""Little House on the Prairie"" (no surprise in this last one, since the movie was directed and co-written by Michael Landon Jr.).  Cali Forbes is a sweet-natured young girl, growing up in early 19th Century Appalachia, who believes that a mysterious hooded hermit - the local ""sin-eater"" - will be able to take away the guilt she feels over ""causing"" the death of her little sister in a river accident.  She spends most of the movie seeking him out, much to the consternation of her parents and the myriad ""colorful"" folk who inhabit their little cove.  However, it isn't until Cali encounters a wandering preacher (played by E.T.'s now-grownup buddy, Henry Thomas) that she learns who the ""true"" sin-eater really is (though one wonders how anyone in this particular time and place can be as woefully ignorant about the gospel as the people here seem to be).Although the first half of the movie achieves a certain portentous creepiness in its tone and atmosphere, once the evangelist shows up, the movie devolves into an overwrought melodrama, marked by stilted dialogue, holier-than-thou speechifying and heavy-handed sentimentality.  The acting, even on the part of Thomas and Louise Fletcher, is generally amateurish and wooden, although young Liana Liberato as Cali has a natural dignity and poise that work well on screen.  And, oh yes, the scenery is eye-popping and gorgeous.Based on the novel by Francine Rivers, ""The Last Sin Eater"" clearly has its heart in the right place, but good intentions alone can't make it a satisfying movie.",2,plays like an ABC After Sunday School Special,1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,2045,"['According', 'ancient', 'Celtic', 'tradition', 'sin', 'eater', 'person', 'chosen', 'lottery', 'take', 'transgressions', 'others', 'soul', 'so', 'newly', 'deceased', 'can', 'pass', 'great-beyond', 'free', 'stain', 'iniquity', 'Last', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'latest', 'offering', 'FoxFaith', 'Films', 'branch', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Studios', 'Christian-friendly', 'moviemaking', 'well-meaning', 'leaden', 'strangely', 'eclectic', 'work', 'sort', 'Village', 'Old', 'Time', 'Gospel', 'Hour', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'surprise', 'last', 'one', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'co-written', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Jr.', 'Cali', 'Forbes', 'sweet-natured', 'young', 'girl', 'growing', 'up', 'early', '19th', 'Century', 'Appalachia', 'who', 'mysterious', 'hooded', 'hermit', 'local', 'sin-eater', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'away', 'guilt', 'causing', 'death', 'little', 'sister', 'river', 'accident', 'most', 'movie', 'seeking', 'out', 'much', 'consternation', 'parents', 'myriad', 'colorful', 'folk', 'who', 'inhabit', 'little', 'cove', 'However', ""n't"", 'Cali', 'wandering', 'preacher', 'played', 'E.T', 'now-grownup', 'buddy', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'who', 'true', 'sin-eater', 'really', 'one', 'how', 'anyone', 'particular', 'time', 'place', 'can', 'be', 'woefully', 'ignorant', 'gospel', 'people', 'here', 'seem', 'be', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'certain', 'portentous', 'creepiness', 'tone', 'atmosphere', 'once', 'evangelist', 'up', 'movie', 'overwrought', 'melodrama', 'marked', 'stilted', 'dialogue', 'holier-than-thou', 'speechifying', 'heavy-handed', 'sentimentality', 'acting', 'even', 'part', 'Thomas', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'generally', 'amateurish', 'wooden', 'young', 'Liana', 'Liberato', 'Cali', 'natural', 'dignity', 'poise', 'work', 'well', 'screen', 'oh', 'yes', 'scenery', 'eye-popping', 'gorgeous.Based', 'novel', 'Francine', 'Rivers', 'Last', 'Sin', 'Eater', 'clearly', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'good', 'intentions', 'alone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'satisfying', 'movie']",The Last Sin Eater

Cady thinks the 'sin eater' in their village can cure her like he forgives all the people in their village by eating foods left for 'sin eater' and redemption is automatically in place. Nevertheless, she still feels guilt after asking their village 'sin eater' to eat the bread she's left for her sins, until she finds a real preacher that's been cast out of their village by the locals for trying to spread the Word of Jesus. (They all think he's crazy, because the town already has a 'sin eater'). They think he's the work of the devil until Cady speaks with him and finds forgiveness through prayer to the Lord. Feeling free of her sin, she goes home to spread the Word, and finds that the locals aren't satisfied until the last ""passing bell"" is rung.

The lead character is young Cadi Forbes [played brilliantly by Liana Liberato]who carries a heavy burden of guilt as she feels responsible for her younger sister's death. At her grandmother's funeral, she looks upon the 'sin-eater', a person chosen by the community to lead a life of isolation, only to appear at funerals and 'consume' the sins of the dead so that they may rest in peace. Intent upon having her own sins absolved, Cadi sets out on a journey of hope, and tries to find the sin eater. Not only does she find him, but discovers that the community is not completely clear of conscience themselves, and it takes a man of faith to make her and the rest see the truth.

There are also good supporting roles such as Thomas Howell as the preacher.
