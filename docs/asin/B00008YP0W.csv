750696,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00008YP0W,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 3/13Rate: 53/13: The first ever battle between ironclads occurred during the Civil War between North and South was the Monitor vs. the Merrimack (technically, the Virginia as the Merrimack the frigate was taken apart for spare parts to be the ironclad as it was). I give the film Ironclads high marks for showing the ironclads as they looked during the battle. There is nothing fancy about it, and there is nothing fast in the actions of the men. That's what I appreciate about the film. On the other hand, the story about Virginia Madsen's character takes a lot away from the film (the whole thing is too damned unconvincing). I would have preferred to see it cut out and the battle as the cynosure. Much more of the time could have gone into showing the development of the two ironclads. Neither survived for very long afterwards, and the term ironclad went out of favor about three decades later. Eventually, what came after them are the battleships, dreadnoughts, cruisers, and the likes. All in all, Ironclads is a good slice of U.S. history, but faugh that love story.",3,THE MONITOR VERSUS THE VIRGINIA!,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,1082,"['Viewed', '3/13Rate', '53/13', 'first', 'ever', 'battle', 'ironclads', 'occurred', 'Civil', 'War', 'North', 'South', 'was', 'Monitor', 'Merrimack', 'technically', 'Virginia', 'Merrimack', 'frigate', 'was', 'taken', 'apart', 'spare', 'parts', 'be', 'ironclad', 'was', 'give', 'film', 'Ironclads', 'high', 'marks', 'showing', 'ironclads', 'looked', 'battle', 'nothing', 'fancy', 'nothing', 'fast', 'actions', 'men', 'what', 'appreciate', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'story', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'character', 'lot', 'away', 'film', 'whole', 'thing', 'too', 'damned', 'unconvincing', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'cut', 'out', 'battle', 'cynosure', 'Much', 'more', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'showing', 'development', 'two', 'ironclads', 'survived', 'very', 'long', 'afterwards', 'term', 'ironclad', 'went', 'favor', 'three', 'decades', 'later', 'Eventually', 'what', 'came', 'are', 'battleships', 'dreadnoughts', 'cruisers', 'likes', 'Ironclads', 'good', 'slice', 'U.S.', 'history', 'love', 'story']",N/A

Collins,"[7, 13]","Completely ignoring the success of movies with a wealth of historical accuracy, such as Gettysburg, or even the Longest Day, the producers of this turkey give us poor acting (why does EVERY actress-wannabe insist on  raising the pitch of her voice and using a GEORGIAN accent?  Maybe use  actresses who have actually LIVED in the South next time?) chopped up  history, and special effects from the 1950's.  Supposedly a female Southern  spy uses her feminine charms to get details of new ironclad designs to her  lover, who just happens to be in the Confederate Navy.  Such a character  DID exist, a Virginian woman was quite &quot;popular&quot; in the  Washington Society of time and did pass on information, but nothing like  this contrived silliness.  The scenes concerning the shock caused by the  CSS Virginia in Hampton Roads are fairly accurate, as is the final  inconclusive battle between the Virginia and the Monitor-if you ignore the  obvious model-kits-in-a-swimming-pool special effects.  Either fast-forward  the tape for the last 25 minutes or so, or better yet, watch the History  and Discovery Channels for their occasional documentaries on these two  revolutionary warships.

Ryan,"[1, 1]","I enjoyed this movie, first when I saw it on television and later when I acquired a copy for my vcr.I enjoyed the opening scenes of the burning of Norfolk navy yard even though it was clearly done slightly on the cheap. I certainly enjoyed the interior scenes of the ironclads in action. I loved the costuming. I enjoyed the acting of Fritz Weaver who played the eccentric genius John Ericson though I really do wish his story had been better told. He didn't submit his design the Monitor. He was originally brought in by one of the contractors to examine another's design. He casually took his design for an Ironclad he had offered Napoleon III to show what he knew of Ironclad warships. Showed the plans, the model and then casually answered every question fielded about it. After  which time it was taken to the board and submitted by this man without Ericson's knowledge.What I really did not like was the patheticly done Love Triangle between Virginia Madsen and the two naval heroes. It comes across dry and stiff and a waste of time watching.Other than that this is a good film to watch.",4,needs ironing,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,1094,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'first', 'when', 'saw', 'television', 'later', 'when', 'acquired', 'copy', 'vcr.I', 'enjoyed', 'opening', 'scenes', 'burning', 'Norfolk', 'navy', 'yard', 'even', 'was', 'clearly', 'done', 'slightly', 'cheap', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'interior', 'scenes', 'ironclads', 'action', 'loved', 'costuming', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'Fritz', 'Weaver', 'who', 'played', 'eccentric', 'genius', 'John', 'Ericson', 'really', 'do', 'wish', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'told', 'did', ""n't"", 'submit', 'design', 'Monitor', 'was', 'originally', 'brought', 'one', 'contractors', 'examine', 'design', 'casually', 'took', 'design', 'Ironclad', 'had', 'offered', 'Napoleon', 'III', 'show', 'what', 'knew', 'Ironclad', 'warships', 'Showed', 'plans', 'model', 'then', 'casually', 'answered', 'question', 'fielded', 'time', 'was', 'taken', 'board', 'submitted', 'man', 'Ericson', 'knowledge.What', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'patheticly', 'done', 'Love', 'Triangle', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'two', 'naval', 'heroes', 'dry', 'stiff', 'waste', 'time', 'watching.Other', 'good', 'film', 'watch']",N/A
