901268,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B00094ARXC,Anton Ilinski,"[8, 13]","I want to say straight away: the concept of the film was great if not to say ingenious. This is the first movie where dead people don't act like blood and flesh-thirsty creatures, here they are ""returnees"" who came back and want to return to their normal lives. Just think how many possibilities can this astonishing plot afford - people who are happy to see their deceased ones, those who don't want to meet them at all because (admit it) it's pretty eerie, one of the marriage-partners returns and sees that the other one is already living happily with a new husband (wife), and what would that other person do in this situation, a murder victim meets his killer (what would be the reaction), should a murderer be judged after he's returned?There's a million questions the makers of the film could ask but they didn't. Instead they are concentrating on a couple of returnees' lives after their comeback, but this concentration doesn't lead anywhere. I can say that there are many uneasy and sombre moments in the film, the atmosphere of total incomprehension of what happened is done great, but it's one of those cases when we ask ourselves after the final credits: so what does this all mean? along with many other questions. No answers are given by the director. None.And talking of questions - if some person returns from the dead and begins to live normally among people, and if you know this person - wouldn't you want to ask him something? I bet you would. And I'm pretty sure I know exactly what you are going to ask him about. But noone asks in the movie! I was waiting for the whole 2 hours - and nothing. Just some kid tried to say something but grown-ups obturated him quickly. And noone else asks. When such things happen - I don't believe a film. Living dead are OK but not asking them about what they experienced is improbable.So I gave it 3 stars for a try but it could have been much better.

901273,A29VKODW4R5U7W,B00094ARXC,dooby,"[16, 19]","This is NOT a horror movie. Neither is it really a zombie flick. It could have worked as an existentialist study but in the end it doesn't quite amount to that either.It helps somewhat to point out that this was made in France. The French always seem to have an odd way of looking at things. Its original title was ""Les Revenants"" (The Returnees/The Ghosts). The basic premise is that of your typical zombie flick. Seventy million recently deceased have arisen from graves around the world. Several thousand of them are to be found in the little French town we are concerned with. These are not your typical zombies with rotting flesh and decaying clothes. They all look fresh and lively and dressed as if they were going out on a Sunday picnic. They don't appear to have any ill intent. In fact they look quite pitiable. The majority are elderly and frail. The reaction of the townsfolk is also not one of terror like in most zombie flicks, but of pragmatism - how to reintegrate them into society. I liked how the producers took this rather novel approach to the movie. The director also stated how he wanted to produce a movie exploring the process of mourning. This too would have been a fertile field to plough. However it never really seems to pan out.We get to see how society, specifically the French bureaucracy, handles the Returnees. It is all done with cool governmental efficiency, much like any other refugee resettlement problem. Scientific studies are made which reveal that the Returnees are not like real human beings after all. They are both mentally and physically sluggish. They have low body temperatures but enhanced immunity to infections. They do not sleep and get agitated at night, wandering aimlessly for miles only to be brought back to government shelters the next morning. Pharmaceutical companies quickly develop medications to placate them. As some of them cannot function in their former jobs, they have to be retrained at a lower capacity. I thought the societal angle was very well done. The personal angle less so. The film could have explored more clearly how the living come to terms with the return of loved ones they have long given up for dead. Unfortunately it doesn't do that. Neither does it explore to any great depth the themes of loss and bereavement. It had so many possibilities. Most were just skimmed over. Instead it reverted to a standard clich&eacute; of almost all zombie movies - all zombies turn bad in the end and they can only be defeated with violence. ""Les Revenants"" began with an intriguing idea and novel approach that whetted the appetite but the development and ending was a letdown.Wellspring has provided a fine transfer in the film's original 2.35:1 aspect ratio (anamorphic). Picture quality is clean, clear and sharp with bright vibrant colors, good black levels and good shadow detail, essential in a movie with lots of dark scenes. Sound is in the original French 2.0 stereo or a Dolby 5.1 remix. Optional English subtitles are provided. There is an interesting 20 minute ""Making Of"" featurette, cast filmographies, the theatrical trailer and four other trailers of Wellspring releases. Personally I found the movie disappointing. You should probably rent it first before deciding whether you want a copy.",3,"Return of the Living Dead, French style...

901274,A23FPOXQ6HIN4J,B00094ARXC,Evan Harris,"[5, 6]","I lucked into this little known flick and am glad I did. I am a dedicated horror fan and Zombie films are what I cut my blood-soaked teeth on. Dawn of the Dead(1979) still ranks as my favorite horror flick and since then Ive gotten hold of whatever Zombie flick I could. What Ive learned from that is that there are alot... I mean alot of derivative or just plain bad zombie movies out there. Im somewhat of a traditionalist, I prefer the Romero zombie type but have really enjoyed movies like the Dawn remake or 28 Days Later(contention for whether or not thats really a zombie movie-BEGIN!!)because they did somehting different, showed a side that wasn't standard typical zombie fare. Well if those seemed like departures, wait until you take a gander at this one.Simply put, this is a zombie film in the fact that the dead have returned.Thats pretty much where the comparison stops. Yes the dead have returned, in fact the movie starts with the streets of a small French town flooded with almost angelic looking people that very quickly we realize have been dead for years in most cases. They look exactly the same as they did before they died, as if nothing had ever happened and basically try to pick up where they left off. This of course is complicated by the fact that their loved ones have moved on, none of them remember dying and while they all look like themselves,they all have something almost sinister behind their eyes. Also presenting a huge problem for everyone around them-what do we do with them. The questions of why and how these people have returned are quickly replaced with how are they going to become active members of society again. Soon after semi resuming their lives, the returned start clamoring to escape the lives they came back to. They are driven by a need to leave. Some of them meet secretly at night planning something that doesnt materialize until the last few minutes of the movie.I dont think that revealing it would ruin the movie, but Im not gonna say anyway,nyah nyah.I can understand anyone seeing this movie and disputing that it is horror. Its not in the traditional sense. Not once is there a jump scare, no gore, they all look and act like completly normal people. What made it count to me is that it plays on more basic human fears. The whole reason(as far as the filmakers are concerned I think) is not to have us afraid of physical monsters that might eat us, its to make us afraid of what we have inside us every day.. fear of the unknown,loss,lonliness the true fear of having what you want given to you only to find out its not what you thought it was. It even plays the terrorism angle at one point. What would you do if someone you loved turned out to be capable of violent acts for their own agenda? But its not played that heavy as there are no real victims of the ""acts of terrorism""(to quote myself) in the film. Its more rumination on life and letting go than it is anything else and what struck me was that in those cases,those scenes rattled me in a way that horror movies usually don't. Basic human emotion can be just as scary as any monster.The film itself is beuatifully shot and all the acting is great. It is a pet peeve of mine when movies of this type go the exra mile to explain whats happening instead of dealing with it and the fact that the reason the dead came back is not touched on makes it more mysterious and eerie and the reactions by the characters around them add to that atmosphere.Everyone in the movie realistically portrays what is almost impossible to imagine. What would you do if someone you loved dearly had passed away and you had just started getting on with your life and there they were. The best example of this in the film is a middle aged couple who've had their son returned to them and the difficulty it creates in their relationship. As they realize their son wants to leave again, all their guilt,anger with each other and desire to do whats best for their son(or themselves) comes bubbling to the surface.

901277,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00094ARXC,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[20, 23]","A zombie film, yes, but do not expect a traditional zombie experience when viewing They Came Back.  These zombies do not seek to gorge human flesh, or to frighten the audience.  Instead the director Robin Campillo delivers a cerebrally stimulating narration of the return of the dead in his directorial d&eacute;but.  Before making this non-traditional zombie film Campillo co-wrote and edited Laurent Cantet's memorable Time Out (2001), which offered a thoughtful tale of a laid-off office worker that takes his destiny in his own hands.  There are stronger similarities between Time Out and They Came Back than between this zombie film and any of the more traditional zombie films such as Night of the Living Dead (1968).Without delay the audience is informed about the sudden return of more than 70 million people, and approximately 13,000 have come back from the dead in the town in which the story takes place.  These people who have returned have passed away within the last ten years, which means that there are many familiar faces among the returnees.  They all wear light colored clothing and seem to be in excellent condition.  This means that they will not have the familiar zombie look with decaying body parts or the peculiar gangly movement.  Nothing seems to be different between them and the living with the exception of a blank and confused look on their faces.In order to handle this sudden return of the vast number of people the authorities have taken control of most community Centers and warehouses in order to house the newly emerged population.  The line of reasoning is based on identification of the returnees and to study them in more detail.  In the order families discover their once lost family members the returnees can return to their old homes.  However, many remain for a prolonged time in these temporary community shelters due to many various personal reasons.  Nonetheless, it is evident that the people who have come back from the dead will cause additional problems to the living in several different ways.Campillo's zombie film turns into a philosophical tale that illustrates the tangible question of what if people came back from the dead and populated earth.  A wide range of notions are addressed throughout the film such as over-population, unemployment, governmental expenses, and much more.  In the backdrop of political issues, the story reveals how it influences macrosociety.  To further Campillo's visual manifestation of politics it could suggest an intangible concept that the human race might not be far from these issues when observing the world and its unyielding population increase.The film also goes into great depth of how the return of deceased family member would influence the family and the individual.  This view of a microsociety is delivered through three different marriages where the couples are of various ages.  One family deals with the return of their dead son while the other two deal with the return of a spouse either male and female.  Under close scrutiny the emotional impact seems to be emphasized on the family level.  Here the viewer can experience the psychological aftermath of enduring bereavement to have these old psychological scars once again torn up.  The psychological stress is not to be underestimated in a situation such as They Came Back offers, which displays an extensive array of emotional characteristics.A vast sense of stress and anxiety rests within the film, but it never tips over when it feels overwhelming. The cast performs terrifically where they deliver genuine emotions such as confusion and a subtle apprehensive tension.  The camerawork and lighting bind together the cast performances into a thick fabric where both the society and the family unit merge in an unsympathetic atmosphere where facts rule.  Amidst this seemingly strong society the individual's are adrift in a disorientated emotional state while blindly reaching out for anything that could help them.  All of the complexities within They Came Back offer a unique cinematic experience that encourages much philosophical contemplative work.  Unfortunately, at times the film feels a little too cerebral which causes some scenes to suffer from mental congestion.",4,Very Cerebral and Non-Traditional Zombie Film - Not For Everyone...,1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,4236,"['zombie', 'film', 'yes', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'traditional', 'zombie', 'experience', 'when', 'viewing', 'Came', 'Back', 'zombies', 'do', 'not', 'seek', 'gorge', 'human', 'flesh', 'frighten', 'audience', 'Instead', 'director', 'Robin', 'Campillo', 'cerebrally', 'stimulating', 'narration', 'return', 'dead', 'directorial', 'd', 'eacute', 'making', 'non-traditional', 'zombie', 'film', 'Campillo', 'co-wrote', 'edited', 'Laurent', 'Cantet', 'memorable', 'Time', 'Out', '2001', 'offered', 'thoughtful', 'tale', 'laid-off', 'office', 'worker', 'destiny', 'own', 'hands', 'are', 'stronger', 'similarities', 'Time', 'Out', 'Came', 'Back', 'zombie', 'film', 'more', 'traditional', 'zombie', 'films', 'such', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', '1968', 'delay', 'audience', 'informed', 'sudden', 'return', 'more', '70', 'million', 'people', 'approximately', '13,000', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'town', 'story', 'place', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'returned', 'have', 'passed', 'away', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'are', 'many', 'familiar', 'returnees', 'wear', 'light', 'colored', 'clothing', 'seem', 'be', 'excellent', 'condition', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'familiar', 'zombie', 'look', 'decaying', 'body', 'parts', 'peculiar', 'gangly', 'movement', 'Nothing', 'be', 'different', 'living', 'exception', 'blank', 'confused', 'look', 'faces.In', 'order', 'handle', 'sudden', 'return', 'vast', 'number', 'people', 'authorities', 'have', 'taken', 'control', 'most', 'community', 'Centers', 'warehouses', 'order', 'house', 'newly', 'emerged', 'population', 'line', 'reasoning', 'based', 'identification', 'returnees', 'study', 'more', 'detail', 'order', 'families', 'discover', 'once', 'lost', 'family', 'members', 'returnees', 'can', 'return', 'old', 'homes', 'However', 'many', 'remain', 'prolonged', 'time', 'temporary', 'community', 'shelters', 'due', 'many', 'various', 'personal', 'reasons', 'Nonetheless', 'evident', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'will', 'cause', 'additional', 'problems', 'living', 'several', 'different', 'ways.Campillo', 'zombie', 'film', 'philosophical', 'tale', 'tangible', 'question', 'what', 'people', 'came', 'back', 'dead', 'populated', 'earth', 'wide', 'range', 'notions', 'are', 'addressed', 'film', 'such', 'over-population', 'unemployment', 'governmental', 'expenses', 'much', 'more', 'backdrop', 'political', 'issues', 'story', 'how', 'macrosociety', 'further', 'Campillo', 'visual', 'manifestation', 'politics', 'could', 'suggest', 'intangible', 'concept', 'human', 'race', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'far', 'issues', 'when', 'observing', 'world', 'unyielding', 'population', 'increase.The', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'depth', 'how', 'return', 'deceased', 'family', 'member', 'would', 'influence', 'family', 'individual', 'view', 'microsociety', 'delivered', 'three', 'different', 'marriages', 'where', 'couples', 'are', 'various', 'ages', 'One', 'family', 'deals', 'return', 'dead', 'son', 'other', 'two', 'deal', 'return', 'spouse', 'male', 'female', 'close', 'scrutiny', 'emotional', 'impact', 'be', 'emphasized', 'family', 'level', 'Here', 'viewer', 'can', 'experience', 'psychological', 'aftermath', 'enduring', 'bereavement', 'have', 'old', 'psychological', 'scars', 'once', 'again', 'torn', 'up', 'psychological', 'stress', 'not', 'be', 'underestimated', 'situation', 'such', 'Came', 'Back', 'offers', 'extensive', 'array', 'emotional', 'characteristics.A', 'vast', 'sense', 'stress', 'anxiety', 'rests', 'film', 'never', 'when', 'overwhelming', 'cast', 'performs', 'terrifically', 'where', 'deliver', 'genuine', 'emotions', 'such', 'confusion', 'subtle', 'apprehensive', 'tension', 'camerawork', 'lighting', 'bind', 'together', 'cast', 'thick', 'fabric', 'where', 'society', 'family', 'unit', 'merge', 'unsympathetic', 'atmosphere', 'where', 'rule', 'Amidst', 'seemingly', 'strong', 'society', 'individual', 'are', 'adrift', 'disorientated', 'emotional', 'state', 'blindly', 'reaching', 'out', 'anything', 'could', 'help', 'complexities', 'Came', 'Back', 'offer', 'unique', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'much', 'philosophical', 'contemplative', 'work', 'Unfortunately', 'times', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'cerebral', 'scenes', 'suffer', 'mental', 'congestion']",They Came Back
901278,A1PL8JA0TEHBVN,B00094ARXC,Paulo Leite,"[5, 9]","Well... I bought this DVD with a lot of anticipation because when I read the synopsis, I thought ""Wow, what a way of putting things""... I meant... the dead returning... ALIVE? And there was more: society trying to cope with the fact that those ""revenants"" had to go back to their families, work, etc...I found the approach very unusual and with endless narrative possibilities.But after seeing the movie, I found it to be (sadly) dissapointing.First.Not that the story and the premisse are not great. They are. But after that the story has nothing to offer. The story starts with the incredible flow of people walking down the streets. We see the response from the authorities... the shelters... the meetings... the discussions... the first reactions from the living (all very interesting)....But I did not see the thing I wanted to see: people asking the question I would ask (if I were to be in their place) - WHY IT HAPPENED AND HOW IT HAPPENED?... Because this is the question that frightens us the most (specially if there is no answer for it). People may argue that the film is not about the cause... but about the effect. Ok, but questioning the cause is part of the effect (and the fact that there is no answer would only add to the drama)Second.People came back from death (the biggest question mark over mankind)... and nobody asks what was like to be dead? Nobody explores this question? It seems like the film misses some key issues just in order to be different (but ""key issues"" are key issues because of some reason...)Third.After 50 minutes, the film looses all its steam because the story runs out of complications. So... they act bizarre... THEN WHAT? Well... they stroll every night... THEN WHAT?? Well... nobody's sure if they are the same people... THEN WHAT??? Well... they don't talk much... PLEASE!! THEN WHAT??????This is probably the first ""non-horror""-horror film (laughs) where the only abnormal story element is the strangeness of the characters (that never pays off).Fourth.The ending... again we have a story that is bult on a great premisse but doesn't know how to end (and cheats the viewer under a mask of subjectiveness and obscurity). We don't really know what happens at the end. The obscurity goes like this: ""Oh, maybe they wrere never here..."" or ""Oh, maybe they were here, but no quite"" or ""maybe they were a contructon of the living"" or ""Oh, maybe blah blah blah""But if you consider a premisse this strong (the dead are back. They are not the same and we have to deal with them) such an ending is very unsatisfying.But I still liked the movie. And I'd still recomend it for its radical different approach on zombies (well... these are not zombies... but that's another discussion).I just don't see the point on making a horror film for those who hate horror films (and I think there is something of this here). I am not saying this film should go after the gore we see everywhere else. There are other ways of frighten people without any gore. There are ways of taking such a strong premisse to the climax it deserved. If the screenwriter (and the director) was trying to be different just to be different... well... they missed the chance to make the horror film of the decade.See it for yourself.",3,GEORGE A.

Robin Campillo, the editor on Qui a tue Bambi?, in his first directorial effort, and you gotta love the premise: suddenly, with no warning, everyone who's died within a certain time rises from the dead and comes back to the town where they lived. Not as zombies, really; they're capable of communicating, they want their old jobs back, etc. They're just a little stiff, and they don't need to sleep. It's a zombie movie without zombies. Its whole purpose seems to be to ask what we'd do, as a society, in such a situation, and for its first hour and change, it provides us with an interesting answer to the question. Unfortunately, then comes the last twenty minutes, where the movie blows up, never regaining its footing.That first hour, though, is wonderful. Human beings react humanly. There's no sense of sweeping panic, nor any sense that any one character's reactions are supposed to be synecdochic of the whole town; everyone reacts a bit differently, and the town leaders, riddled with their own questions, have a difficult time trying to figure out what to do. (The answer is in no way surprising. Warning: this is not a movie for optimists.) And that first bit is fantastic drama-slash-allegory, the kind of thing we don't see nearly enough.Then Campillo tries to turn it into... what? A horror film? An action movie? I have no idea. And it goes down the tubes. I've seen some interesting explanations for the final twenty minutes (no one, of course, knows for sure), and I'd be willing to embrace any one of them, or offer up my own, had I managed to make heads or tails of it at all. After I watched it, I went back and watched the final scenes again to see if I'd missed anything, because it didn't seem coherent. Then I did it again. And I came to the conclusion that, no, the simple answer is that the end is an incoherent mess. I cannot adequately express how unfortunate that is, given how great the beginning hour is.As for the allegory, someone on the IMDB boards called this a zombie movie with Alzheimer's patients instead of zombies. While I think his tongue was planted firmly in his cheek, I do think he's onto something there. The ""zombies"" seem more like people who are suffering from some form of lingering illness that may or may not be terminal (after all, they're already dead, what can kill them a second time?), and that the living try to manage with drugs, therapy, etc. If you've spent any time in rest homes, either working there or visiting relatives with Alzheimer's, the parallel will be chilling. Been there, done that, and I was probably more affected by the movie for it.Overall, I liked it. It could have been a truly great film. Unfortunately, it's hamstrung by its own ending. ***",3,"So good, until it blows up in your face and leaves you wondering what on earth everyone involved was thinking.",1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,2801,"['Les', 'Revenants', 'Robin', 'Campillo', '2004', 'Man', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'Robin', 'Campillo', 'editor', 'Qui', 'tue', 'Bambi', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', 'got', 'ta', 'premise', 'suddenly', 'warning', 'everyone', 'who', 'died', 'certain', 'time', 'dead', 'back', 'town', 'where', 'lived', 'Not', 'zombies', 'really', ""'re"", 'capable', 'communicating', 'want', 'old', 'jobs', 'back', 'etc', ""'re"", 'just', 'little', 'stiff', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'sleep', 'zombie', 'movie', 'zombies', 'whole', 'purpose', 'be', 'ask', 'what', ""'d"", 'do', 'society', 'such', 'situation', 'first', 'hour', 'change', 'interesting', 'answer', 'question', 'Unfortunately', 'then', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'where', 'movie', 'up', 'never', 'regaining', 'footing.That', 'first', 'hour', 'wonderful', 'Human', 'beings', 'react', 'humanly', 'sense', 'sweeping', 'panic', 'sense', 'one', 'character', 'reactions', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'synecdochic', 'whole', 'town', 'everyone', 'bit', 'differently', 'town', 'leaders', 'riddled', 'own', 'questions', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'answer', 'way', 'surprising', 'Warning', 'not', 'movie', 'optimists', 'first', 'bit', 'fantastic', 'drama-slash-allegory', 'kind', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'nearly', 'enough.Then', 'Campillo', 'tries', 'turn', 'what', 'horror', 'film', 'action', 'movie', 'have', 'idea', 'down', 'tubes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'interesting', 'explanations', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'one', 'course', 'sure', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'embrace', 'one', 'offer', 'up', 'own', 'had', 'managed', 'make', 'heads', 'tails', 'watched', 'went', 'back', 'watched', 'final', 'scenes', 'again', 'see', ""'d"", 'missed', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'coherent', 'Then', 'did', 'again', 'came', 'conclusion', 'simple', 'answer', 'end', 'incoherent', 'mess', 'can', 'not', 'adequately', 'express', 'how', 'unfortunate', 'given', 'how', 'great', 'beginning', 'hour', 'is.As', 'allegory', 'someone', 'IMDB', 'boards', 'called', 'zombie', 'movie', 'Alzheimer', 'patients', 'instead', 'zombies', 'think', 'tongue', 'was', 'planted', 'firmly', 'cheek', 'do', 'think', 'something', 'there', 'zombies', 'seem', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'suffering', 'form', 'lingering', 'illness', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'terminal', ""'re"", 'already', 'dead', 'what', 'can', 'kill', 'second', 'time', 'living', 'try', 'manage', 'drugs', 'therapy', 'etc', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'time', 'rest', 'homes', 'either', 'working', 'there', 'visiting', 'relatives', 'Alzheimer', 'parallel', 'will', 'be', 'chilling', 'Been', 'there', 'done', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'affected', 'movie', 'it.Overall', 'liked', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'hamstrung', 'own', 'ending', '***']",They Came Back
901282,A3V03HSQS3SFLU,B00094ARXC,S. Marzioli,"[4, 14]","This movie had one of the best premises: the recently dead inexplicably come back to life and return in droves to the cities they had once lived in and the families they had left behind.  Unlike typical films of this genre, these ""zombies"" aren't brain hungry maniacs.  They are perfectly normal looking in every way, save a condition which renders them incapable of creative thinking (?!?  See below) and the fact that their body temperatures are slightly lower than normal.So what's the suspense, the thrills or even horror of this film?  Nothing really.  It's about as exciting as watching over-the-hill french people meander around because that's precisely what happens.  One of the major plot points revolves around the problem of integration.  With thousands of unexpected citizens returning to life, what is a government to do?  How can families cope having mostly healed from the loss of their loved ones, only to get them back so unexpectedly?  While these questions might sound good on paper, the fact that I have already mentioned the plot works itself out through meandering frenchies should give you a clue to how effectively they are answered.Really, to like this film you have to want to, you have to have tremendous patience and you have to be a little more pretentious than the average film goer.  As for me, I need a film to be a little more than unusual and French to keep my interest.  This was no ""nifty nail-biter,"" nor a ""triumph of internal horror.""  I was so disappointed that I immediately placed this dvd for sale on amazon's merchant marketplace.But the real coup de grace is the much hyped secret zombie plan.  This is what kept me going.  This is what gave me the motivation to sit through 103 minutes of dullness.  Sorry folks, there is no reprieve.  The secret zombie plan was to blow up buildings (with no occupants) and then flee into underground tunnels.  Why?  That's a good question.  If it isn't answered by french people meandering on and off screen, then it isn't answered.  And it isn't answered by french people meandering on and off screen.  (Also, how did they create this plan if they have problems with creative thinking?)I hated this film.  Not simply because I'm a hard core zombie fan that wanted to try something that was BOTH &lt;u>interesting&lt;/u> and different.

901283,A2GS6XMWDUA4KG,B00094ARXC,T. Briggs,"[0, 0]","Les RevenantsA thematic current has been playing itself out over the last decade.  It is the walking dead.  There is at one end of the spectrum, of course, the wonderful zombie soap opera of the same name that is so hot it has its own after show and a slew of games.  On the other end of the spectrum is the cerebral zombie.  These zombies typically have no hunger which eliminates the need for intestine and brain eating scenes.  While the Caesar Romero film, &#34;Night of the Living Dead&#34; inspired the Kirkman comic book, pardon me, graphic novel, it was the French, &#8220;Les Revenants&#8221; that started the cerebral zombie phenomenon.  Since its debut in 2004 there has been the wildly successful 2012 French series, &#8220;The Returned&#8221; which was optioned by Sundance and is truly one of the most unusual, unique, engaging series I have ever seen on the home screen.  ABC is presently airing &#8220;Resurrected&#8221; and has officially sprung for a second year.Les Revenants opens with thousands of folks leaving a cemetery looking freshly shaved, coiffed and neatly dressed.  It&#8217;s as if their blood had never been drained and replaced with bubble gum colored embalming solutions not to mention characters free of the broken necks and shattered bodies that accompanied their deaths in the first place.&#8220;The Returned&#8221; takes the creepy &#8220;Twin Peaks&#8221; style which works for its more localized phenomenon rather than a global one.  Outside of the small rural town in which the action plays death goes on as usual.  &#8220;Les Revenants&#8221; opens with thousands of people leaving the cemetery in broad daylight and heading into town.  Initially, &#8220;Les Revenants&#8221; shows us these returned folks as almost normal, just a bit slow and out of synch.  They are returned to society and to old jobs and lives with folks who have already grieved their demise and have psychologically and emotionally moved on with their lives.  Yup, people are complicated, especially dead ones.  Apparently there are 70 million worldwide.  But we&#8217;re in a small town in rural France, St. Somethingorother.  They don&#8217;t like to sleep and they like to wander at night.Considering most are elderly and retired this creates a problem.  And the fact that they have no appetites makes dinners awkward.  But they can still make whoopee in spite of being 5 degrees cooler and impervious to infection.  It&#8217;s France so there are discussions about the need to repatriate these workers and luckily for France they have a government that steps up.  In the Republican wet dream version in the USA, one can only imagine that particular discussion centering on why anyone should pay their dead workers when they&#8217;ll obviously work for free. But this is France so when they send up the balloons with the thermal cameras to watch their &#8220;interesting&#8221; movements at night, herd mentaility, we discover that the French word for &#8220;Big Brother&#8221; is &#8220;Beeg Bro-thare.&#8221;The film does a good job of building suspense and suppressing the &#8220;oh come on&#8221; level of disbelief.  You&#8217;d think one might be curious about how they got out of their coffins considering all the graves are still intact.  You&#8217;d think the burning question is what&#8217;s on the other side.  But the only child that asks her new and improved grandma that question is shushed by her mother.  Oh come on, you&#8217;d  think everyone wants to know that.  And God love &#8216;em, the French can film a pregnant pause better than most which makes the love scene between reunited lovers the perfect segue to the first meeting where scientists are beginning their quantitative and qualitative studies on Les Revenants.We see them meeting at night and then a bit of mayhem as Les Revenants just up and go.  They descend into pipes below the ground to do what who knows.  No questions are asked and none are answered.  I suspect the same will be true of tonight&#8217;s season finale of &#8220;Resurrection.&#8221;  And yet I will watch that too.Zombie themes are always fun.",3,Pass the Brains and hot sauce please.,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,4114,"['Les', 'RevenantsA', 'thematic', 'current', 'been', 'playing', 'last', 'decade', 'walking', 'dead', 'one', 'end', 'spectrum', 'course', 'wonderful', 'zombie', 'soap', 'opera', 'same', 'name', 'so', 'hot', 'own', 'show', 'slew', 'games', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'cerebral', 'zombie', 'zombies', 'typically', 'have', 'hunger', 'need', 'intestine', 'brain', 'eating', 'scenes', 'Caesar', 'Romero', 'film', '34', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', '34', 'inspired', 'Kirkman', 'comic', 'book', 'pardon', 'graphic', 'novel', 'was', 'French', '8220', 'Les', 'Revenants', '8221', 'started', 'cerebral', 'zombie', 'phenomenon', 'debut', '2004', 'been', 'wildly', 'successful', '2012', 'French', 'series', '8220', 'Returned', '8221', 'was', 'optioned', 'Sundance', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'unique', 'engaging', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'home', 'screen', 'ABC', 'presently', 'airing', '8220', 'Resurrected', '8221', 'officially', 'sprung', 'second', 'year.Les', 'Revenants', 'thousands', 'folks', 'leaving', 'cemetery', 'looking', 'freshly', 'shaved', 'coiffed', 'neatly', 'dressed', '8217', 'blood', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'drained', 'replaced', 'bubble', 'gum', 'colored', 'embalming', 'solutions', 'not', 'mention', 'characters', 'free', 'broken', 'necks', 'shattered', 'bodies', 'accompanied', 'deaths', 'first', 'place.', '8220', 'Returned', '8221', 'creepy', '8220', 'Twin', 'Peaks', '8221', 'style', 'more', 'localized', 'phenomenon', 'rather', 'global', 'one', 'small', 'rural', 'town', 'action', 'death', 'usual', '8220', 'Les', 'Revenants', '8221', 'thousands', 'people', 'leaving', 'cemetery', 'broad', 'daylight', 'heading', 'town', 'Initially', '8220', 'Les', 'Revenants', '8221', 'returned', 'folks', 'almost', 'normal', 'just', 'bit', 'slow', 'synch', 'are', 'returned', 'society', 'old', 'jobs', 'lives', 'folks', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'grieved', 'demise', 'have', 'psychologically', 'emotionally', 'moved', 'lives', 'Yup', 'people', 'are', 'complicated', 'especially', 'dead', 'ones', 'Apparently', 'are', '70', 'million', 'worldwide', '8217', 're', 'small', 'town', 'rural', 'France', 'St.', 'Somethingorother', 'don', '8217', 't', 'sleep', 'like', 'wander', 'night.Considering', 'most', 'are', 'elderly', 'retired', 'problem', 'fact', 'have', 'appetites', 'dinners', 'awkward', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'whoopee', 'spite', 'being', '5', 'degrees', 'cooler', 'impervious', 'infection', '8217', 's', 'France', 'are', 'discussions', 'need', 'repatriate', 'workers', 'luckily', 'France', 'have', 'government', 'up', 'Republican', 'wet', 'dream', 'version', 'USA', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'particular', 'discussion', 'centering', 'why', 'anyone', 'should', 'pay', 'dead', 'workers', 'when', '8217', 'obviously', 'work', 'free', 'France', 'so', 'when', 'send', 'up', 'balloons', 'thermal', 'cameras', 'watch', '8220', 'interesting', '8221', 'movements', 'night', 'herd', 'mentaility', 'discover', 'French', 'word', '8220', 'Big', 'Brother', '8221', '8220', 'Beeg', 'Bro-thare.', '8221', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'building', 'suspense', 'suppressing', '8220', 'come', '8221', 'level', 'disbelief', '8217', 'think', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'curious', 'how', 'got', 'coffins', 'considering', 'graves', 'are', 'still', 'intact', '8217', 'think', 'burning', 'question', 'what', '8217', 's', 'other', 'side', 'only', 'child', 'new', 'improved', 'grandma', 'question', 'shushed', 'mother', 'Oh', 'come', '8217', 'think', 'everyone', 'know', 'God', 'love', '8216', 'French', 'can', 'film', 'pregnant', 'pause', 'better', 'most', 'love', 'scene', 'reunited', 'lovers', 'perfect', 'segue', 'first', 'meeting', 'where', 'scientists', 'are', 'beginning', 'quantitative', 'qualitative', 'studies', 'Les', 'Revenants.We', 'see', 'meeting', 'night', 'then', 'bit', 'mayhem', 'Les', 'Revenants', 'just', 'up', 'go', 'descend', 'pipes', 'ground', 'do', 'what', 'who', 'questions', 'are', 'asked', 'none', 'are', 'answered', 'suspect', 'same', 'will', 'be', 'true', 'tonight', '8217', 'season', 'finale', '8220', 'Resurrection.', '8221', 'yet', 'will', 'watch', 'too.Zombie', 'themes', 'are', 'always', 'fun']",They Came Back
901284,A2W8H62ICF3OHJ,B00094ARXC,"T. Hunt ""wasabi crush""","[19, 19]","The film opens with a parading mass indicative of a rising.  Their sluggish mannerisms are fairly typical of classic undead cinema, but characteristically they're quite different. Cleanly, almost casually dressed and not at all aggressive, it appears that they've just simply returned.The reaction following is handled elegantly by authorities and well-chronicled throughout the movie: the reanimated are contained, analyzed, and finally released into the arms of the loved ones willing to take them back.It's at this point that the movie takes on an unsettling tone.  The idea of losing a lover, friend, or family member is hardly alien to most viewers, so the plot is completely accessible.  The grieving process is excruciating, exhausting.  It's also intrusive.  Your soul has to heal, and in doing so, will often push the severity of a loss somewhere deep where it too can die.Imagine finally emerging from this process only to have the loved one return alive and seemingly healthy. They look the same, but something's off, as if they've only memorized their past and are playing it back to appease you.It's an interesting concept and worth your consideration provided you fall under a certain criteria, or lack thereof.  Fans of zombie cinema craving the normalcy of it will most likely be disappointed.  There's no gore and barely enough violence to garner even the most cursory horror nod.Those approaching with an inclination towards a softer, more layered spin on what has become a worn genre, however, will undoubtedly be satisfied.  The movie instills a dark and moody introspection that I found rewarding.In the end, I do believe that at its core, this is a deeply disturbing love story brought to you by a country with an acclaimed history of successfully presenting just that.Enjoy.- t -28 July, 2010",5,A unique angle on the undead genre.,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,1815,"['film', 'parading', 'mass', 'indicative', 'rising', 'sluggish', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'fairly', 'typical', 'classic', 'undead', 'cinema', 'characteristically', ""'re"", 'quite', 'different', 'Cleanly', 'almost', 'casually', 'dressed', 'not', 'aggressive', ""'ve"", 'just', 'simply', 'returned.The', 'reaction', 'following', 'handled', 'elegantly', 'authorities', 'well-chronicled', 'movie', 'reanimated', 'are', 'contained', 'analyzed', 'finally', 'released', 'arms', 'loved', 'ones', 'willing', 'take', 'back.It', 'point', 'movie', 'unsettling', 'tone', 'idea', 'losing', 'lover', 'friend', 'family', 'member', 'hardly', 'alien', 'most', 'viewers', 'plot', 'completely', 'accessible', 'grieving', 'process', 'excruciating', 'exhausting', 'also', 'intrusive', 'soul', 'heal', 'doing', 'so', 'will', 'often', 'push', 'severity', 'loss', 'somewhere', 'deep', 'where', 'too', 'can', 'die.Imagine', 'finally', 'emerging', 'process', 'only', 'have', 'loved', 'one', 'return', 'alive', 'seemingly', 'healthy', 'look', 'same', 'something', 'off', ""'ve"", 'only', 'memorized', 'past', 'are', 'playing', 'back', 'appease', 'you.It', 'interesting', 'concept', 'consideration', 'provided', 'fall', 'certain', 'criteria', 'lack', 'thereof', 'Fans', 'zombie', 'cinema', 'craving', 'normalcy', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'gore', 'barely', 'enough', 'violence', 'garner', 'even', 'most', 'cursory', 'horror', 'nod.Those', 'approaching', 'inclination', 'softer', 'more', 'layered', 'spin', 'become', 'worn', 'genre', 'however', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'satisfied', 'movie', 'dark', 'moody', 'introspection', 'found', 'rewarding.In', 'end', 'do', 'believe', 'core', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'love', 'story', 'brought', 'country', 'acclaimed', 'history', 'successfully', 'presenting', 'just', 'that.Enjoy.-', 't', '-28', 'July', '2010']",They Came Back
901285,A3DJXS3PFBB48P,B00094ARXC,Woodlandtrails,"[3, 5]","This film has English sub-titles and a definite twist.  The zombies are not mean, nasty people eating traditional zombies. Since this is France, there is no blaming God or anything about our sin bringing this onto us which if the U.S. had done this film, it would have.  It was more of a resurrection (as in like Christ) of the people who died within 10 years who rise from the dead rather than a zombie film which is another reason why this is a definite French twist.  THAT religious connotation is radioactive.That said, They Came Back could have been so much more fleshed out.  They never really explained WHY it happened. Admittedly I nodded off during some of it as parts CRAWLED slowly forward so I may have missed it.  If they did explain, I am NOT subjecting myself to a 2nd viewing to find out.Was it aliens who possessed the recently dead bodies?The 3 rating was for the psychological aspects of the living people who have to welcome their dead parent, spouse or child back into their lives.  How do you have sex with a being several degrees cooler than you are even if he is your spouse?I wondered if the woman got pregnant and WHAT THAT  child would be like.There could have been so much more done with this film if they hadn't crawled so SLOWLY through it and wasted time.Still, it gets kudos for original thinking.
