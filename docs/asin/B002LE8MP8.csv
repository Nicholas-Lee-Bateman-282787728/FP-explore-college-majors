1276235,A1K6A7JXC1CU81,B002LE8MP8,"Aglio ""Classic Film Lover""","[11, 11]","The Damned United is not your typical sports film. It's much more than that. It's a study of contrasting personalities. Set during the 60s and 70s, the movie details the conflict of two very different managers of rival football (soccer) clubs i.e. Brian Clough and Don Revie. Don Revie (played by Colm Meaney) is the manager of the top ranked and virtually unbeatable, Leeds United. They are the Damned United of the title. Brian Clough (played by Michael Sheen) is the very outspoken, but extremely talented manager of a second tier team, Derby County.At the start of the film, Revie has accepted the position of manager for Team England. That leaves the position of Leeds United manager open and the job is offered to Brian Clough. The film traces Brian Clough's rise as Derby County manager and fall as Leeds. Of course, he finds much more success after his tenure at Leeds United. But, that's another movie. Most Americans might ignore a film about English football thinking the subject boring. This is not the case. It's a marvelous character study and a fantastic movie. Michael Sheen's performance as Brian Clough is absolutely riveting.  He's a very talented and versatile actor with roles as diverse as David Frost, Tony Blair and even Lucien from Underworld. I found myself fascinated by Clough's obsession with Revie. That obsession is what drives the plot. The adapted script is extremely well done by Peter Morgan. He also wrote the screenplays for Frost/Nixon and the Queen. It's an extremely literate script with sharp dialog.One thing I will mention is that while Colm Meaney did not have as much screen time as Michael Sheen, he makes his presence felt as Revie. He's a marvelous character actor who has big shoes to fill with this role. All the characters in this film are larger than life. Now, what makes this story interesting is that you eventually learn that Brian Clough's obsession with Revie arose from a perceived slight at a match. Clough says that Revie refused to shake his hand at the end of a game. Is that what has been driving this man ? That obsession is what keeps you glued to your seat. Michael Sheen is just that good at playing Clough. He's a foul mouthed ball of energy.And this movie isn't just about the conflict between Clough and Revie. It's also a very good portrait of the friendship between Clough and his co-manager, Peter Taylor played by Timothy Spall. These two are also contrasting personalities. Peter Taylor was Brian Clough's anchor. He kept all of Clough's eccentricities in check. He's the sensible one. They were a team and when they had a fall out, that left Clough foundering.One small detail I found interesting was the accents of the performers. Most Americans are used to hearing the polished accents of BBC English. There's none of that here. The movie is filled with rough Northern accents that may seem jarring at first, but eventually grow on a person.This is a movie I hope more people will watch because it really is a fascinating subject. Is it true to life ? I'm sure it's a dramatization of the facts. However, that does not detract from the movie. You expect movies to take a certain amount of poetic license. Make time to see this movie, you won't regret it.",5,The Damned United - Not Your Average Sports Movie,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,3233,"['Damned', 'United', 'not', 'typical', 'sports', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'study', 'contrasting', 'personalities', 'Set', '60s', '70s', 'movie', 'details', 'conflict', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'managers', 'rival', 'football', 'soccer', 'i.e', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'Don', 'Revie', 'Don', 'Revie', 'played', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'manager', 'top', 'ranked', 'virtually', 'unbeatable', 'Leeds', 'United', 'are', 'Damned', 'United', 'title', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'played', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'very', 'outspoken', 'extremely', 'talented', 'manager', 'second', 'tier', 'team', 'Derby', 'County.At', 'start', 'film', 'Revie', 'accepted', 'position', 'manager', 'Team', 'England', 'position', 'Leeds', 'United', 'manager', 'open', 'job', 'offered', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'film', 'traces', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'rise', 'Derby', 'County', 'manager', 'fall', 'Leeds', 'course', 'much', 'more', 'success', 'tenure', 'Leeds', 'United', 'movie', 'Most', 'Americans', 'might', 'ignore', 'film', 'English', 'football', 'thinking', 'subject', 'boring', 'not', 'case', 'marvelous', 'character', 'study', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'performance', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'very', 'talented', 'versatile', 'actor', 'roles', 'as', 'diverse', 'David', 'Frost', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'even', 'Lucien', 'Underworld', 'found', 'fascinated', 'Clough', 'obsession', 'Revie', 'obsession', 'what', 'plot', 'adapted', 'script', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplays', 'Frost/Nixon', 'Queen', 'extremely', 'literate', 'script', 'sharp', 'dialog.One', 'thing', 'will', 'mention', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'presence', 'felt', 'Revie', 'marvelous', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'role', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'larger', 'life', 'Now', 'what', 'story', 'interesting', 'eventually', 'learn', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'obsession', 'Revie', 'arose', 'perceived', 'slight', 'match', 'Clough', 'Revie', 'refused', 'shake', 'hand', 'end', 'game', 'what', 'been', 'driving', 'man', 'obsession', 'what', 'glued', 'seat', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'just', 'that', 'good', 'playing', 'Clough', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'ball', 'energy.And', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'conflict', 'Clough', 'Revie', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'portrait', 'friendship', 'Clough', 'co-manager', 'Peter', 'Taylor', 'played', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'two', 'are', 'also', 'contrasting', 'personalities', 'Peter', 'Taylor', 'was', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'anchor', 'kept', 'Clough', 'eccentricities', 'check', 'sensible', 'one', 'were', 'team', 'when', 'had', 'fall', 'out', 'left', 'Clough', 'foundering.One', 'small', 'detail', 'found', 'interesting', 'was', 'accents', 'performers', 'Most', 'Americans', 'are', 'used', 'hearing', 'polished', 'accents', 'BBC', 'English', 'none', 'here', 'movie', 'filled', 'rough', 'Northern', 'accents', 'may', 'seem', 'jarring', 'first', 'eventually', 'grow', 'person.This', 'movie', 'hope', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'watch', 'really', 'fascinating', 'subject', 'true', 'life', ""'m"", 'sure', 'dramatization', 'facts', 'However', 'not', 'detract', 'movie', 'expect', 'movies', 'take', 'certain', 'amount', 'poetic', 'license', 'Make', 'time', 'see', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",The Damned United

Growing up as a soccer fanatic in England at the time I was very familiar with all the characters in this movie. I could even reel off the names of the players in Leeds United and some of the other teams, to the amazement of my American wife.The central character is Brian Clough, the manager of lowly second division Derby County, who is brash, outspoken, brilliant but hopelessly insecure. He relies on his low-key partner Peter Taylor to keep his wilder excesses in check and make sure he says balanced. Together, they are an unbeatable team.Just up the motorway are mighty Leeds United coached by Don Revie, a tough disciplinarian adored by his players but hated by the rest of the country because of their brutal playing style.Clough is snubbed by Revie at their first encounter and develops an obsession to beat him. And he succeeds. Derby win the second division, gain promotion to the first and amazingly win the championship in their first season in the top flight.Then Revie is appointed coach of the England national team and Clough gets the chance to replace him at Leeds, where he hopes to eradicate his predecessor's brutal regime and impose a more attractive style of football. Except the players don't go along -- and Clough has lost his anchor because Taylor has refused to follow him to Leeds.After 44 days Clough is sacked -- and has to put his life back in balance.The performances in this movie are amazing. Michael Sheen as Clough is like a reincarnation. He has that distinctive voice -- the north-eastern accent and the long drawn-out whine exactly right. Colm Meaney is Revie brought back to life.Anyone who loves soccer and England and remembers the seventies will enjoy this movie.",5,Wonderful drama and trip down memory lane,1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,1755,"['events', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'real', 'Growing', 'up', 'soccer', 'fanatic', 'England', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'familiar', 'characters', 'movie', 'could', 'even', 'reel', 'off', 'names', 'players', 'Leeds', 'United', 'other', 'teams', 'amazement', 'American', 'wife.The', 'central', 'character', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'manager', 'lowly', 'second', 'division', 'Derby', 'County', 'who', 'brash', 'outspoken', 'brilliant', 'hopelessly', 'insecure', 'low-key', 'partner', 'Peter', 'Taylor', 'keep', 'wilder', 'excesses', 'check', 'make', 'sure', 'balanced', 'Together', 'are', 'unbeatable', 'team.Just', 'motorway', 'are', 'mighty', 'Leeds', 'United', 'coached', 'Don', 'Revie', 'tough', 'disciplinarian', 'adored', 'players', 'hated', 'rest', 'country', 'brutal', 'playing', 'style.Clough', 'snubbed', 'Revie', 'first', 'encounter', 'obsession', 'beat', 'Derby', 'win', 'second', 'division', 'gain', 'promotion', 'first', 'amazingly', 'win', 'championship', 'first', 'season', 'top', 'flight.Then', 'Revie', 'appointed', 'coach', 'England', 'national', 'team', 'Clough', 'chance', 'replace', 'Leeds', 'where', 'eradicate', 'predecessor', 'brutal', 'regime', 'impose', 'more', 'attractive', 'style', 'football', 'players', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'along', 'Clough', 'lost', 'anchor', 'Taylor', 'refused', 'follow', 'Leeds.After', '44', 'days', 'Clough', 'sacked', 'put', 'life', 'back', 'balance.The', 'performances', 'movie', 'are', 'amazing', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Clough', 'reincarnation', 'distinctive', 'voice', 'north-eastern', 'accent', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'whine', 'exactly', 'right', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'Revie', 'brought', 'back', 'life.Anyone', 'who', 'soccer', 'England', 'seventies', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie']",The Damned United
1276238,A3TXO9NUIJ4G0X,B002LE8MP8,Angela,"[4, 4]","The Damned United looks and smells and sounds like a sports film, but it is ultimately a Shakespearean tragedy imbued with deep romance. That the tragic hero at its center, Brian Clough (Michael Sheen, brilliant), is wearing soccer shorts instead of a crown doesn't minimize the grandeur and pathos, indeed, the epic quality of his fall from grace. That the similarly epic love is between two middle-aged men likewise doesn't diminish it. This is one of the sweetest, most heart-breaking stories of hubris and, ultimately, the redemption of love we have seen in a long while. (Really!)The setting is 1970s England, where - much as it remains today - soccer rivalries are fierce, and matches are cause for national celebration or mourning. In this heady world of winners and losers, of glamour and legends, a young, cocky manager, Brian Clough, is newly promoted to Leeds United. Leeds United was, in 1974, the top English team, and Clough has big shoes to fill - Leeds' former manager, the beloved Don Revie (Colm Meaney), has left to manage the national English team, and he leaves behind him a wake of trophies and a team of fiercely loyal players. Clough, odiously arrogant, swoops in on the very wrong foot, with complaints about Leeds' weather (""Wish I was still back in Majorca!"" he exclaims obnoxiously) and radical rules - such as that former manager Revie's name must never be mentioned - quickly alienating the players, the owners, and the fans. Clough's tenure at Leeds, indeed, was a complete failure: under him, Leeds lost games, fell to the bottom of the division, and he was quickly sacked after 44 days.The film underpins this tale of torturous disaster with a flashback to when Brian Clough, together with his partner, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), managed the unknown Division II team, Derby United, to unknown heights of glory. Spurred on by insatiable ambition, as well as his hurt pride at losing to Leeds without even an acknowledgement of a handshake by Revie, Clough drags the team up from the Division II nether regions, eventually catapulting it to the top of the Division I. It is here that England begins to take notice, and Clough's ego begins to swell.The story is beautifully told. It manages to project this classical weight of tragic flaws and doomed anti-heroes without ever becoming bogged down by it. Some sequences - such as Derby United's rematch against Leeds, as experienced privately by Clough, locked in his office - are incredibly sweeping. Indeed, it is in scenes like this - as well as the media interview Clough gives with Revie - where typically ""British"" filmmaking is used to great effect. That is, by opting for subtlety and the quiet roar, i.e. less is more, the power of these moments in Clough's life is greatly felt. Michael Sheen's acting is likewise brilliant; the look on his face when Revie, on live television, explains why he failed with Leeds was gut-wrenching.Similarly, the love between Clough and Peter Taylor is palpable from the beginning - their shared joy, boyish tackles and Taylor's loyalty and unacknowledged importance are obvious to the viewer, if not to Clough himself. Indeed, as Clough powers ahead on - per Taylor's words, and per the usual classical drama - his doomed, misguided quest, it becomes more and more obvious how important Taylor is to Clough. There's a great scene when Taylor chastises Clough for being too ambitious, describing it like a sleeping monster that, when awoken, manages to swallow everything up - even the beautiful. The later falling out between Clough and Taylor on the sunny shores of Majorca underscores this wonderfully.By the end of the movie, we were dying to see the two men, the ""damned united"" of Derby, finally reconciled, and the film - for all its wallowing in defeat and destruction and vengeance and tragic flaws - does have a slightly more upbeat coda. Overall, an absolute joy.*Review originally published at The Post-Punk Cinema Club: [...]",5,"Shakespeare and Sopochles and soccer (sorry, football)",1272240000,"04 26, 2010",2010,3962,"['Damned', 'United', 'smells', 'sports', 'film', 'ultimately', 'Shakespearean', 'tragedy', 'imbued', 'deep', 'romance', 'tragic', 'hero', 'center', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'brilliant', 'wearing', 'soccer', 'shorts', 'instead', 'crown', ""n't"", 'minimize', 'grandeur', 'pathos', 'indeed', 'epic', 'quality', 'fall', 'grace', 'similarly', 'epic', 'love', 'two', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'likewise', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'one', 'sweetest', 'most', 'heart-breaking', 'stories', 'hubris', 'ultimately', 'redemption', 'love', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'while', 'Really', 'setting', '1970s', 'England', 'where', 'much', 'today', 'soccer', 'rivalries', 'are', 'fierce', 'matches', 'are', 'cause', 'national', 'celebration', 'mourning', 'heady', 'world', 'winners', 'losers', 'glamour', 'legends', 'young', 'cocky', 'manager', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'newly', 'promoted', 'Leeds', 'United', 'Leeds', 'United', 'was', '1974', 'top', 'English', 'team', 'Clough', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'Leeds', 'former', 'manager', 'beloved', 'Don', 'Revie', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'left', 'manage', 'national', 'English', 'team', 'wake', 'trophies', 'team', 'fiercely', 'loyal', 'players', 'Clough', 'odiously', 'arrogant', 'swoops', 'very', 'wrong', 'foot', 'complaints', 'Leeds', 'weather', 'Wish', 'was', 'still', 'back', 'Majorca', 'obnoxiously', 'radical', 'rules', 'such', 'former', 'manager', 'Revie', 'name', 'must', 'never', 'be', 'mentioned', 'quickly', 'alienating', 'players', 'owners', 'fans', 'Clough', 'tenure', 'Leeds', 'indeed', 'was', 'complete', 'failure', 'lost', 'games', 'fell', 'bottom', 'division', 'was', 'quickly', 'sacked', '44', 'days.The', 'film', 'tale', 'torturous', 'disaster', 'flashback', 'when', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'together', 'partner', 'Peter', 'Taylor', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'managed', 'unknown', 'Division', 'II', 'team', 'Derby', 'United', 'unknown', 'heights', 'glory', 'Spurred', 'insatiable', 'ambition', 'as', 'well', 'hurt', 'pride', 'losing', 'Leeds', 'even', 'acknowledgement', 'handshake', 'Revie', 'Clough', 'team', 'up', 'Division', 'II', 'nether', 'regions', 'eventually', 'catapulting', 'top', 'Division', 'here', 'England', 'take', 'notice', 'Clough', 'ego', 'swell.The', 'story', 'beautifully', 'told', 'project', 'classical', 'weight', 'tragic', 'flaws', 'doomed', 'anti-heroes', 'ever', 'becoming', 'bogged', 'down', 'sequences', 'such', 'Derby', 'United', 'rematch', 'Leeds', 'experienced', 'privately', 'Clough', 'locked', 'office', 'are', 'incredibly', 'sweeping', 'Indeed', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'media', 'interview', 'Clough', 'Revie', 'where', 'typically', 'British', 'filmmaking', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'opting', 'subtlety', 'quiet', 'roar', 'i.e', 'more', 'power', 'moments', 'Clough', 'life', 'greatly', 'felt', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'acting', 'likewise', 'brilliant', 'look', 'face', 'when', 'Revie', 'live', 'television', 'why', 'failed', 'Leeds', 'was', 'gut-wrenching.Similarly', 'love', 'Clough', 'Peter', 'Taylor', 'palpable', 'beginning', 'shared', 'joy', 'boyish', 'tackles', 'Taylor', 'loyalty', 'unacknowledged', 'importance', 'are', 'obvious', 'viewer', 'not', 'Clough', 'Indeed', 'Clough', 'powers', 'ahead', 'Taylor', 'words', 'usual', 'classical', 'drama', 'doomed', 'misguided', 'quest', 'more', 'more', 'obvious', 'how', 'important', 'Taylor', 'Clough', 'great', 'scene', 'when', 'Taylor', 'Clough', 'being', 'too', 'ambitious', 'describing', 'sleeping', 'monster', 'when', 'awoken', 'swallow', 'everything', 'up', 'even', 'beautiful', 'later', 'falling', 'out', 'Clough', 'Taylor', 'sunny', 'shores', 'Majorca', 'end', 'movie', 'were', 'dying', 'see', 'two', 'men', 'damned', 'united', 'Derby', 'finally', 'reconciled', 'film', 'wallowing', 'defeat', 'destruction', 'vengeance', 'tragic', 'flaws', 'have', 'slightly', 'more', 'upbeat', 'coda', 'Overall', 'absolute', 'joy', '*Review', 'originally', 'published', 'Post-Punk', 'Cinema', 'Club', '[', ']']",The Damned United

Even if you're not a football fan, the Damned United is a terrific story of the human ego.Michael Sheen is nothing less than brilliant in his (largely ficionalized) portrayal of the flamboyant and arrogant football manager Brian Clough.  Timothy Spall also deserves kudos for his terrific performance as Clough's right-hand man, Pete Taylor.The Damned United is very much a traditional epic, in that we watch our protagonist (however self-destructive) go from greatness to a fall from grace, only to rise from the ashes once again.  What makes this sports story different, is that his ascent to greatness is only mentioned as a brief note after the film's conclusion, which ends on a relative down note.

Morgan's screenplay (based on David Peace's novel) creates a most compelling triangulation of adult male friendships and rivalries.Clough (played to perfection by Michael Sheen) adores his dutiful right-hand man, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), while despising his rival Don Revie (Colm Meaney). When he takes over for Revie (who leaves Leeds to coach the English national team), Clough's on-the-field failures lead to a falling out with his friend.UNITED is a joyride of a sports film. There is the thrill of competition and the agony of defeat, of course...made all the more so by the inner turmoil that drives the talented Clough, who is haunted by father-figures from opposite ends of the spectrum.Sheen's performance here could have been just brash and cold, yet it is his portrayal of Clough's desperation and vulnerability that gives this film a beating heart and a loving soul.THE DAMED UNITED is classic Tom Hooper in that way; damnable famous men resized to next-door neighbor scale.",5,Classic Tom Hooper: damnable famous men resized to next-door neighbor scale.,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,1234,"['giving', 'Best', 'Picture', 'THE', 'KING', 'SPEECH', '2010', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'made', 'glorious', 'British', 'football', 'biopic', 'THE', 'DAMNED', 'UNITED.You', 'need', ""n't"", 'know', 'Leeds', 'United', ""1970's-era"", 'English', 'football', 'even', 'manager', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'adore', 'film', 'Morgan', 'screenplay', 'based', 'David', 'Peace', 'novel', 'most', 'compelling', 'triangulation', 'adult', 'male', 'friendships', 'rivalries.Clough', 'played', 'perfection', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'dutiful', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Peter', 'Taylor', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'despising', 'rival', 'Don', 'Revie', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'When', 'Revie', 'who', 'Leeds', 'coach', 'English', 'national', 'team', 'Clough', 'on-the-field', 'failures', 'lead', 'falling', 'out', 'friend.UNITED', 'joyride', 'sports', 'film', 'thrill', 'competition', 'agony', 'defeat', 'course', 'made', 'more', 'so', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'talented', 'Clough', 'who', 'haunted', 'father-figures', 'opposite', 'ends', 'spectrum.Sheen', 'performance', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'brash', 'cold', 'portrayal', 'Clough', 'desperation', 'vulnerability', 'film', 'beating', 'heart', 'loving', 'soul.THE', 'DAMED', 'UNITED', 'classic', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'way', 'damnable', 'famous', 'men', 'resized', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'scale']",The Damned United

Yet here I sit, critiquing THE DAMNED UNITED, about Brian Clough's controversial 44 days as the manager of the Leeds United Club. Now I took a look at this film because I love docudramas and I love England and I love soccer--and because I do actually recall Clough making international headlines of sorts.Clough is played brilliantly by a somewhat make-up-heavy Michael Sheen. I have remarked in the past about how I am irritated by Sheen's one-trick-pony performances. Well, none of that here. He does an excellent rendition of Clough, right down to the occasional gravelly voice (which Clough suffered on occasion). This film jumps in time, from 1974 back to 1969 and forward to 1973, back to '69, ending at the end of Clough's soccer managing career.The film does it expertly. Not only this, I had always known how dirty a soccer player could be, out on the pitch--this film taught me how dirty and soulless the guys-behind-the-scene can be. It's like catching a glimpse of the man behind the curtain, only to see him doing something unspeakable.That is what this film is truly about, no baloney and no guesswork. Clough and former Leeds manager Don Revie (Colm Meanie, oh sorry, Meaney) really have it in for each other. This movie is the story of Clough replacing Revie as Revie moved upstairs big time. The way they attacked each other on television, which I'm sure is an immortal moment in British TV, is classic to watch. Sir Michael Parkinson, a personal favorite, appears as himself which brings me to the expertly smooth interface of this film with actual historic footage.Here again, as in THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP, the film ends not with Sheen but with the real Clough, as his partner Peter Taylor (played by Timothy Spall in the film) sits next to him. We see first hand their relationship as portrayed in the film, as a reporter asks Taylor something and Clough answers. The reporter then asks Taylor if he likes someone speaking for him all the time. More classic!Other than snippets showing dirty pool during matches, do not expect much soccer action--which doesn't belong in this anyway. I disagree very strongly that this film ""has as much to do with soccer as CITIZEN KANE has to do with newspapers"".Kudos to the great Jim Broadbent, making a sort of cameo as Sam Longson, the man who gave Clough his start in management. Broadbent not only deserves a big fat knighthood: it's about time America began cherishing this global treasure of cinema. I will say the same about Timothy Spall, who seems to be everywhere at once and yet he's ignored.THE DAMNED UNITED (I am a bit boggled by the title) shows the very soul of soccer in the 1970s.

I was overseas I heard about this movie, based on a true story about controversial soccer manager Brian Clough.When I went to see the movie, in San Francisco, I wondered what other people in the theater might think, if they would get it.Sure enough, non soccer followers, who probably had no clue about Clough or Revie were sucked into the drama of the legendary confrontation, between these two rivals, which surpassed my expectations.Someone more outpoken and more controversial than Brian Clough would be difficult to imagine, someone destined to become one of the most outstanding managers in the history of English soccer. Don Revie managed League Champions Leeds United. Clough managed Derby County previous years League Champions. Don Revie leaves Leeds to manage England, and Leeds made the bonehead decision to appoint the outspoken Clough in his place, outspoken because of his criticism and dislike of both Revie and the style of play under his management. This outspokenness led to clashes with the players whose successful, although rough style, had led them to incredible success.As you get further into the movie, I suspect you will get drawn into its surprising twists and turns.I was particularly impressed with Colm Meaney's portrayal of Revie. At one point I wondered if was actually Revie or Meaney I was watching, if it was actual footage of Revie. Michael Sheen who played Prime Minister Tony Blair in The Queen, nails Clough's distinct accent and outspokenness to a tee. Some of these Leeds players were greats, but the character development is very thin here. I understand that some of these players threatened to sue, as did Clough's family, which might explain this.I wish they had shown more of the Keegan and Bremner sendings off in Clough's first match. One wonders though, why focus on this particular piece of an outstanding career. Clough went on take Nottingham Forest to win both the League Chamionship, and the European Cup, and at one point went 42 league games consecutively without defeat, which I don't think any other manager has ever done.

1276253,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B002LE8MP8,mirasreviews,"[3, 4]","""The Damned United"" has been adapted by Peter Morgan from David Pearce's popular novel ""The Damned Utd."", a fictionalized account of Brian Clough's controversial 44 days as manager of the Leeds United football (soccer) club in 1974. Having had great success in managing the Derby County football club from the bottom of the Second Division to the top of the First, Clough was hired to replace Leeds' outgoing coach Don Revie, who had managed the team through its golden age and was very popular with the players. But Clough was without his righthand man, assistant manager Peter Taylor, at Leeds, and he had always been outspoken against Leeds' style of play. So he came in with the wrong attitude, got off on the wrong foot, and was very publicly sacked in short order.That much is true, but a lot of the other material in ""The Damned United"" is fiction, as is the case in Pearce's novel. Peter Morgan's screenplay shifts the emphasis to make a longstanding rivalry and perceived snub from Don Revie (Colm Meaney) into Clough's primary motivation. So the film isn't faithful to the novel either. Perhaps the most significant fiction is in Brian Clough's (Michael Sheen) relationship with Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), who was, indeed, essential to him, but much has been fabricated. Pains seem to have been taken to write Clough's character accurately, including his use of the media, and Michael Sheen actually looks like Clough. But the same cannot be said for Peter Taylor's character, whom Timothy Spall does not resemble in appearance or manner.""The Damned United"" shifts back and forth between Clough's successes with Derby County in the late 1960s and early 1970s and his doomed tenure at Leeds United in 1974. Clough went on to more success with Nottingham Forest, but focusing on the period 1968-1974 presents Clough's triumphs and failures and the different sides to his personality that account for both. Judging by what I've seen of interviews with former Leeds players, the film has gotten the sources of Clough's difficulties at Leeds right. Despite the dramatic license with motivations, chronologies, conversations, etc, director Tom Hooper has been impressively faithful to the football culture and facilities of the 1970s, which makes this a fine period film as well as something to see for Michael Sheen's superb performance, which captures the comic and dramatic aspects of Clough's bluster.The DVD (Sony 2010): There are 5 featurettes, 9 deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Tom Hooper, and an audio commentary. ""Cloughisms"" (9 min, optional commentary) are 4 omitted interviews of Michael Sheen as Clough, based on real interviews. ""Perfect Pitch: The Making of The Damned United"" (16 min) interviews Tom Hooper and Peter Morgan about adapting the novel, the cast, and talks about filming the football. In ""Creating Clough: Michael Sheen on `Old Big Red'"" (10 min), Sheen talks about his research, preparation, and character. ""Remembering Brian"" (10 min) interviews former footballers about Clough's career. ""The Changing Game: Football in the Seventies"" (19 min) talks to former Leeds players and a historian about the differences between football then and now.  Recommended for viewers who don't know much about British football.

Michael Sheen plays Derby county/ Leeds United manager Brian Clough, A straight talking egotistical man who, along with this partner Perter Taylor(Timothy Spall), had an uncanny talent for taking sub par teams and turning them into champions. The film bounces around his time line by telling how he became a successful coach by leading Derby County, took over the reins of Leeds United from his arch enemy Don Revey(Clom Meaney)and eventually failed and fell into disgrace. Michael Sheen really shines in his roll as Clough and it was a joy to see him return to a roll that seems tailor suited for him. He had a bad run with this rolls in those lame Vampire/Werewolf flicks. He and Spall are the glue that hold the film together and had great chemistry. I didn't know about Clough's story before I watched this film and it's a truly remarkable one. What he did was like talking the Detroit Lions and making them Super Bowl champions. A virtually impossible task. Clough was one of those iconic ""love him or hate him"" type of characters that pop up in sports every once in a while. I liked him right away and his cocky way of telling his bosses off, keeping his players in line and his consuming hatred for that bloody Don Revey are a true joy to witness.

His career as a footballer saw him score goals at a higher ratio than any other player in England, before an ACL injury forced him to retire. At the age of 30, he started a job in football management.Clough's career began to take off when he became manager of Derby County in 1967. He brought in Peter Taylor as his assistant and the two turned the club into a successful team, gaining promotion to the top division in 1969. The title refers to Clough's hatred of Leeds United, after being snubbed by Leeds manager Don Revie during an FA Cup tie.As unlikely as it may seem, Clough eventually went on to manage Leeds United in 1974, but he was sacked after 44 days.The movie jumps between Clough's time at Leeds, and earlier in his career, showing events that led to his hatred of the team, and the reasons he became manager.Director Tom Hooper treats Clough like the hero he was, but doesn't ignore the many mistakes he made during his long management career. Having grown up in the era myself, I feel that the movie does a great job creating the look and feel of the 70s. I remember many of the events, and always smile when I think of Brian Clough. He was outspoken and regarded himself as the best manager in the game. He wasn't afraid to criticize his employers, opposing managers, players, or the media. As a result, his interviews were always entertaining as he apparently didn't care what people thought of him.Michael Sheen perfectly captures the spirit of the man, as well as the voice and the gestures. It's like watching a good impressionist with excellent acting ability. Sheen also worked with writer Peter Morgan on Frost/Nixon and The Queen, playing David Frost and Tony Blair. All three performances are noteworthy and worth your time.Timothy Spall was a good choice for the role of Peter Taylor, and Hooper manages to convince us that the two were close friends for much of the time they worked together. Their relationship was more important than the relationships with their wives in some ways. Other notable performances come from Colm Meaney as Don Revie and Jim Broadbent as Derby County chairman, Sam Longson.The story focuses on the effect Clough on those around him, and ends with a brief summary of what he went on to achieve. Although football is the reason all of this happened, the movie doesn't spend much time showing the players in action. It's more about management and the relationships that Clough formed with employers, colleagues, players and fans.I can't imagine American audiences being very interested in the subject matter, but anyone who was a fan of English football in the 70s will love the nostalgic feel and the accuracy of Sheen's portrayal. It's not hard to see why Tom Hooper has been successful in recent years with The King's Speech and Les Mis&eacute;rables. It's clear that the man knows how to make entertaining movies.",4,Tom Hooper knows how to tell a story,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,2981,"['grew', 'up', 'England', '70s', '80s', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'was', 'something', 'legend', 'career', 'footballer', 'saw', 'score', 'goals', 'higher', 'ratio', 'other', 'player', 'England', 'ACL', 'injury', 'forced', 'retire', 'age', '30', 'started', 'job', 'football', 'management.Clough', 'career', 'began', 'take', 'off', 'when', 'became', 'manager', 'Derby', 'County', '1967', 'brought', 'Peter', 'Taylor', 'assistant', 'two', 'turned', 'club', 'successful', 'team', 'gaining', 'promotion', 'top', 'division', '1969', 'title', 'refers', 'Clough', 'hatred', 'Leeds', 'United', 'being', 'snubbed', 'Leeds', 'manager', 'Don', 'Revie', 'FA', 'Cup', 'tie.As', 'unlikely', 'may', 'seem', 'Clough', 'eventually', 'went', 'manage', 'Leeds', 'United', '1974', 'was', 'sacked', '44', 'days.The', 'movie', 'jumps', 'Clough', 'time', 'Leeds', 'earlier', 'career', 'showing', 'events', 'led', 'hatred', 'team', 'reasons', 'became', 'manager.Director', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'Clough', 'hero', 'was', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'many', 'mistakes', 'made', 'long', 'management', 'career', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'era', 'feel', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'look', 'feel', '70s', 'remember', 'many', 'events', 'always', 'smile', 'when', 'think', 'Brian', 'Clough', 'was', 'outspoken', 'regarded', 'best', 'manager', 'game', 'was', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'criticize', 'employers', 'opposing', 'managers', 'players', 'media', 'result', 'interviews', 'were', 'always', 'entertaining', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'people', 'thought', 'him.Michael', 'Sheen', 'perfectly', 'spirit', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'voice', 'gestures', 'watching', 'good', 'impressionist', 'excellent', 'acting', 'ability', 'Sheen', 'also', 'worked', 'writer', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'Frost/Nixon', 'Queen', 'playing', 'David', 'Frost', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'three', 'performances', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'worth', 'time.Timothy', 'Spall', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'role', 'Peter', 'Taylor', 'Hooper', 'convince', 'two', 'were', 'close', 'friends', 'much', 'time', 'worked', 'together', 'relationship', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'relationships', 'wives', 'ways', 'Other', 'notable', 'performances', 'come', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'Don', 'Revie', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Derby', 'County', 'chairman', 'Sam', 'Longson.The', 'story', 'effect', 'Clough', 'brief', 'summary', 'what', 'went', 'achieve', 'football', 'reason', 'happened', 'movie', ""n't"", 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'showing', 'players', 'action', 'more', 'management', 'relationships', 'Clough', 'formed', 'employers', 'colleagues', 'players', 'fans.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'American', 'audiences', 'being', 'very', 'interested', 'subject', 'matter', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'fan', 'English', 'football', '70s', 'will', 'love', 'nostalgic', 'feel', 'accuracy', 'Sheen', 'portrayal', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'been', 'successful', 'recent', 'years', 'King', 'Speech', 'Les', 'Mis', 'eacute', 'rables', 'clear', 'man', 'how', 'make', 'entertaining', 'movies']",The Damned United
1276259,A3E0J8MIGFSHXB,B002LE8MP8,"Tom Plum ""TC""","[3, 4]","A compelling rewarding movie, destined to become a classic.The bookThe Damned Utdwhich anyone should read that finds this movie interesting along with a number of others on the subject uses a lot of creative license as well but the big difference is that in this movie, Clough is basically a hero as well as being the sport icon he was in the seventies. In the book and surely there is some truth to it since Clough surely suffered from alcoholism in his life, Clough somewhat self-destructs especially in the second half of the book.First off, we need to remember that the movie and the book ""The Damned United"" are both works of fiction, the movie loosely based on the book and the book loosely based on the truth and to go one further, there also exists an additional bookWe Are the Damned United: The Real Story of Brian Clough at Leeds United, as indicated an indeed realistic portrayal of Clough's brief rule at Leeds United. This movie though seems to reach out at portraying much of the essence of the story of the 'Damned United' and scores points for doing so. Clough wanted a clean, talented and honest soccer game, he in fact, discouraged his players from lively 'hotdog' types of celebrations in real life as just one example of his coaching. Clough's philosophy towards the game can be analyzed in some of his famous quotes such as upon arriving at Leeds, he told the players ""You can all throw your medals in the bin because they were not won fairly"" used in the movie.What I do enjoy in the movie is that in the book whereas some essentials might become lost or obscured was how in fact, Cloughie's success truly was in large part to his co-partnership in managment with Peter Taylor, a teammate of Clough going back to his playing days in Sunderland and/or Middlesbrough, Taylor who was a goalkeeper sounded out Clough way back then on ideas and would say things to him to give him confidence. Another famous quote by BC was his saying and yes, it is in the movie, ""I wouldn't say I was the best manager in the business. But I was in the top one."" Now, what does this mean? To me, it dawned on me that he probably means that he was ""in the top one"" in being mindful of his collaboration with Peter Taylor, the two of them as one. Events did not exactly transpire as indicated in the movie but the depiction is nonetheless, basically accurate in the 'big picture' of how things were.The story goes on from here as books on Brian Clough are now a virtual cottage industry with even a sub-category of the ol' Leeds team as well, Leeds, traditional enemy of the Monarchy in English history as well of all things I've heard. One should probably start out withProvided You Don't Kiss Me: 20 Years with Brian Cloughas required reading on Clough, penned by the journalist  Duncan Hamilton who spent close to 20 years with the 'Gaffer' (manager, coach) at the Nottingham Forest club and was the William Hill sport book of the year. Questions some viewers have about this movie are answered in the books which though I have gone on about and this is the movie, the books give us an idea of whether we are seeing a truthful representation. There are also a number of videos around one can watch of the actual interviews presented in this movie. Brian Clough surely had his downside as well but for the most part, in this movie, he is a hero and it's a fair place to start studying the man. In light of the recent incident so well reported on over the past week involving the mishap with the Wales and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey, something you might not know if you only see the movie is that in fact, around 1959, Brian Clough's brilliant career as a player came to an end as the result of his leg being broken. He does allude to his career in the movie by stating something like ""I scored 251 goals in 274 games"", a phenomenal record. His being denied a further career as a player and it coming to such a sudden end, probably added an impetus to him to coach as well as he did. Yes, he was probably ""the best manager England never had"" but being as outspoken as he was, he also enjoyed a sprite career as a TV pundit while still managing and Clough derided the then-manager for England, Sir Alf Ramsey, criticisms Clough later felt some regrets over making when England were eventually eliminated from making the 1974 World Cup and Sir Alf Ramsey was dismissed. That's why that although Clough is a coaching legend and often highly likeable, there's definitely 2 sides to the story and at times, he could be a polarizing figure, as reflected also during his tenure at Leeds and as the reason for his departure from Derby County and not being selected as manager for the England team. Sir Alf Ramsey by the way, was in charge of England's triumph in 1966. Still, polarizing or not, to be a manager anywhere, you are bound to encounter difficulties, if it be in Bob Bradley's position with the USA National soccer team or any other.Of course, anyone who sees the movie 'Queen' is probably struck by Michael Sheen's close resemblance to Tony Blair, so I was skeptical at first on how well he could do Brian Clough. After reading about Clough in a number of books and magazines and watching actual video footage of the man, Sheen does in fact, do a convincing job. The cinematography additionally is quite fantastic in this movie. ""Goal"", ""A shot at glory"" and ""(Escape to) Victory"" may have a bit more soccer action but this movie has the action combined with the managerial duties of Taylor and Clough and that makes this a real winner.The extra features are outstanding and tell one a lot more about this movie including a segment giving a contrarian view of Leeds United versus being the 'dirty team' that they are portrayed to be in the view of Brian Clough. It is worth evaluating to be even-handed in viewing these past events because, yes, this is a point of debate even until today. I'd give it additional high marks for authenticity, the special features point out the stadium used in the movie is from Chesterfield who still retain the same old time stadium with terraces at least for now, add in a pouring rain at some of the matches as one can still see at a number of Premier League games being played nowadays and the setting is very realistic. The only thing I wonder about is if the gold of the Derby County Team would have seen their original stadium painted in the green color scheme (the name of the original stadium the Derby County Rams played in was called of all the things, the Baseball Grounds).We see so many movies where songs from that period are added on to add to the feel of the time. Interestingly, the producers pulled out Deep Purple's 'flight of the rat' and it actually works exceedingly well in a 'soccer' movie, I had to listen to it again a few times. The whole soundtrack is good but I'm not sure if it has come out on CD.",5,The movie takes creative license to spin the tale we see but in doing so becomes better than the book,1267833600,"03 6,
