Focusing on characters that, initially, don't seem as important to the story, for large chunks of film.  However, as Kurosawa also often does, when the final scene has played and you are left with what the film is.  You realize all of the footage is vitally important to what Kurosawa is trying to show you.  As the title suggests, this film is an examination of the human condition and how people can strive to become all that they can or how they can let themselves become much less than they should.

25472,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780021185,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I can't say that I am familiar with the work of famed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa because, quite frankly, I'm not.  In fact, this is the very first film I've seen from his hand, and while I have made the statement before that I am not the usual samurai fan, I must admit that I am intrigued with what this man can do and am quite interested in seeking out some of his other material.  No, this is not a samurai film (far from it) but judging from his control over his source material regardless of genre, I'd love to see what he can do with the genre for which he became so widely adored.So this film is really right up my ally.I love those dark, morally conflicting films that play heavy on the audience to evaluate their own actions.  `Tengoku to Jigoku' is just that type of film.  There are no easy answers here; even if one may want to draw theirs immediately.  It is a true morale play between classes of people, but more importantly between our inner struggle for survival.How would you react?The film tells of a wealthy industrialist, Kingo Gondo, who has just set plans in motion to take over a successful shoe manufacturing company.  Before he can play his cards though, he receives some devastating news.  His son has just been kidnapped.  The man on the other end asks for a sum of money that would wipe out Kingo financially, but it's his son and so there is no hesitation.  Then in walks Kingo's boy and things change.  It is brought to his attention that not his son, but the son of his chauffer has been kidnapped.The kidnapper still wants the money.What follows next is a rather in-depth study of our own conflicting emotions.  Are we willing to lend a helping hand to others when it means our own ruin?  Sure, when our own children or loved ones are at stake then the answer is easy.  I would gladly give my life for my daughter or even for the children of my close friends and I know it goes both ways; but would I risk my future for a business partner if he really needed me too?  Sure, this man has worked for Kingo for some time, but that's all it is; work.Sometimes doing the right thing is not the first thing we want to do.Sometimes the right things are very conditional.Kurosawa develops this film gloriously with the right amount of edge and ambiguity.  The audience is kept on edge as the whole story unfolds, and the way he has mounted the kidnapping brilliantly keeps us guessing as to who is actually behind it.  The clues are everywhere, even if we keep picking up on the wrong ones, so the audience is left constantly double guessing themselves.  The acting is all stellar, especially from Toshiro Mifune.  I can't think of a single fault here, except that maybe the film ended and I really wanted it to keep going.  This is a nice look at the downside to wealth; how it can corrupt and essentially make us a target.",5,Not a single low here; this one ranks very high with me...,1235692800,"02 27, 2009",2009,2854,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'am', 'familiar', 'work', 'famed', 'Japanese', 'director', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'quite', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'not', 'fact', 'very', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hand', 'have', 'made', 'statement', 'am', 'not', 'usual', 'samurai', 'fan', 'must', 'admit', 'am', 'intrigued', 'what', 'man', 'can', 'do', 'am', 'quite', 'interested', 'seeking', 'out', 'other', 'material', 'No', 'not', 'samurai', 'film', 'far', 'judging', 'control', 'source', 'material', 'regardless', 'genre', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'genre', 'became', 'so', 'widely', 'film', 'really', 'right', 'up', 'ally.I', 'love', 'dark', 'morally', 'conflicting', 'films', 'play', 'heavy', 'audience', 'evaluate', 'own', 'actions', 'Tengoku', 'Jigoku', 'just', 'type', 'film', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'here', 'even', 'one', 'may', 'want', 'draw', 'theirs', 'immediately', 'true', 'morale', 'play', 'classes', 'people', 'more', 'importantly', 'inner', 'struggle', 'survival.How', 'would', 'react', 'film', 'tells', 'wealthy', 'industrialist', 'Kingo', 'Gondo', 'who', 'just', 'set', 'plans', 'motion', 'take', 'over', 'successful', 'shoe', 'manufacturing', 'company', 'can', 'play', 'cards', 'devastating', 'news', 'son', 'just', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'man', 'other', 'end', 'sum', 'money', 'would', 'wipe', 'out', 'Kingo', 'financially', 'son', 'so', 'hesitation', 'Then', 'walks', 'Kingo', 'boy', 'things', 'change', 'brought', 'attention', 'not', 'son', 'son', 'chauffer', 'been', 'kidnapped.The', 'kidnapper', 'still', 'money.What', 'next', 'rather', 'in-depth', 'study', 'own', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'Are', 'willing', 'lend', 'helping', 'hand', 'others', 'when', 'own', 'ruin', 'Sure', 'when', 'own', 'children', 'loved', 'ones', 'are', 'stake', 'then', 'answer', 'easy', 'would', 'gladly', 'give', 'life', 'daughter', 'even', 'children', 'close', 'friends', 'know', 'ways', 'would', 'risk', 'future', 'business', 'partner', 'really', 'needed', 'too', 'Sure', 'man', 'worked', 'Kingo', 'time', 'work.Sometimes', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'not', 'first', 'thing', 'want', 'do.Sometimes', 'right', 'things', 'are', 'very', 'conditional.Kurosawa', 'film', 'gloriously', 'right', 'amount', 'edge', 'ambiguity', 'audience', 'kept', 'edge', 'whole', 'story', 'unfolds', 'way', 'mounted', 'kidnapping', 'brilliantly', 'guessing', 'who', 'actually', 'clues', 'are', 'everywhere', 'even', 'keep', 'picking', 'up', 'wrong', 'ones', 'audience', 'left', 'constantly', 'double', 'guessing', 'acting', 'stellar', 'especially', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'fault', 'here', 'maybe', 'film', 'ended', 'really', 'wanted', 'keep', 'going', 'nice', 'look', 'downside', 'wealth', 'how', 'can', 'corrupt', 'essentially', 'make', 'target']",N/A
25473,A1VDRK69F22YMN,0780021185,Anticlimacus,"[4, 52]","Akira Kurosawa (aka: ""AK"", the ""lesser Kurosawa"", etc.) has one of those overblown reputations that earns praise from everyone who can't think for themselves.  If the word ""overrated"" was assigned a picture reference in a dictionary, a portrait of ""AK"" would probably be the best choice.  If the word ""lemming"" was assigned a synonym in a thesaurus, the term ""AK follower"" would fit the bill nicely.  It's no understatement to say that the sheer level of brainless veneration that's repeatedly thrown at this guy hasn't been seen since the advent of organized religion - especially when one considers the fact that most of his movies suck, yet are somehow able to earn IMDb average ratings over 8.0.  These people need to stop beating around the bush and simply construct cathedrals in his honor for daily worship.With ""High and Low"", AK tried and failed to create a mainstream dramatic detective thriller with some exposition on class divisions.  If I want the former, I'll watch ""Memories of Murder"" (2003).  If I want the latter, I'll watch ""Gemini"" (1999).  These films came to my mind while watching this AK entry, and provide a nice contrast between fine and poor filmmaking.  For example, ""High and Low"" lacks the character development and entertainment value that Bong Joon-ho established in ""Memories of Murder"", which included a great chase sequence and an amazing tapering of characters (the loose cannon cop and the empirical detective have their personas expertly blended together near the end).  ""High and Low"" also failed miserably at showcasing the effective juxtaposition between classes that Shinya Tsukamoto so capably portrayed in ""Gemini.""  The smug rich doctor is forced to live in comparable conditions to that of his nemesis to the point where their true merit and worth are brilliantly juxtaposed.  ""High and Low"" fails to achieve the commercial and/or artistic value of the aforementioned films because - to be frank - both the script and direction are hopelessly incompetent.I've seen 10 AK films thusfar (oh, the horror!), and if I can hang my hat on one criticism, it's that AK is frequently hopeless at directing actors (see ""Ikiru"" for overwhelming evidence of his ineptitude).  It's no surprise then that the acting in ""High and Low"" is hit or miss.  Mifune is acceptable for certain roles, but he reminds me of David Caruso here with his desire to make every single line of dialogue a dramatic set piece.  Does every one of his sentences really need to be punctuated with a forced crescendo?  The unintended effect is that his delivery feels artificial - not unlike most of the actors in AK's films.  And seriously, that ""dope alley"" scene was just awful.In vintage AK fashion, ""High and Low"" loses all of its momentum by its midpoint and then proceeds to drag itself into the ground.  The detective investigations during the latter half are about as dry and predictable as it gets.  If that weren't bad enough, key clues are conveniently overlooked for the sole purpose of extending running time.  We get detectives who are able to hear a coin drop on the other end of a phone call, yet completely disregard the loud ramblings of a trolley on another phone call because - well - AK simply MUST ensure that his film lasts 140 minutes.  Forty minutes of dull police proceduring later, the detective cleans the wax out of his ears and - you guessed it - hears the trolley at AK's convenience, but at the point where my attentiveness had been all but scraped away by mediocre filler material.  Oh, and I'd like to personally thank AK for choosing to torture me with one of most boring police/suspect tail sequences in motion picture history.If that weren't bad enough, some of the scoring sucks too.  Just listen to that loud horn music when the abducted kid is recovered by the train tracks.  The ""uber-horn"" makes at least six more unwelcomed entrances afterward.  Remember the angry trumpet in ""American Ninja?""  It's just as bad, and just as intrusive.For the life of me I'll never understand why everyone on planet earth loves AK so much as a director.  It's analogous to being the only atheist in a town full of Catholics.  Sure, I can try to ignore those pesky holy rollers, but there's no way I can have a nice breakfast at a local diner without hearing them go on and on about Pope ""Eggs"" Benedict.  In like manner, I can't escape the tide of unwarranted praise for AK on the internet because the brown-nosing is so extreme and so pronounced that it just grinds on my nerves because these same reviewers will (in the very same breath, no less) trash the latest action film for having ""poor acting"" or a ""subpar script.""  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!  At least I have enough brain cells to understand that dramas should be based on dramatic elements while action films should be based on - oh, I don't know - *action* elements.Okay fine.  I admit that I wouldn't necessarily classify AK as a no-talent assclown (he did direct ""Seven Samurai"", ""Yojimbo"", and ""Sanjuro""), but to be honest - he's really just a mediocre filmmaker who is dangerously close to being a poor director with a few good flukes under his belt.  Sure, I've only seen 10 of his movies, but do you really expect me to continue my masochistic adventure after witnessing a preliminary 30% success rate?  I've still got some Ozu and Naruse films that I gotta see, and I'd rather place my time and money in artists with an 80% success rate.  At least Yasujiro and Mikio know how to direct actors properly.",2,An Average Movie Propped Up By Mass Disillusionment,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,5524,"['Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'aka', 'AK', 'lesser',

25474,ARA48345JZPZR,0780021185,Archmaker,"[13, 15]","This is just plain good solid movie-making.  A kidnap story that reflects some of the tensions &amp; betrayals in the social system of modern Japan, coupled with a police procedural that is first rate.An executive's (Toshiro Mifune) son is kidnapped, but when it is discovered it was his chauffeur's son  taken by mistake and the kidnapper threatens to kill him anyway if ransom isn't paid, the executive, who is embroiled in a power struggle within his corporation and needs all the money the kidnapper demands or face ruin, is truly stuck on the proverbial horns.The first half of the film takes place in the executive's living room, and is a character study and a commentary on corporate greed and back-stabbing and where and to whom one's allegiance and loyalty belongs.  Mifune's Gondo has hard choices to make and ruin of one kind or another lies at the end of either choice.The second half of the film is a police procedural detailing the meticulous efforts to track down the kidnapper(s).  I did not know this film was based on an Ed McBain 87th Precinct Novel until after I had seen it, but this latter part is classic policework McBain-style.  Unfortunately, the police characters &amp; personalities cannot be fully defined and detailed as in the 87th Precinct, but we come to get a sense of some of them.  And the police work is spot-on.  I love the 87th Precinct books, and several so-so movies have been made from them.

He's faced with a moral dilemma: should he pay the ransom anyway and be ruined financially, or not? He decides to pay and get the boy back; then the police go to work to catch the kidnapper.At this point the movie becomes a fast-paced police procedural.

It's a great crime drama; only near the end when the chase takes the police into the seamy side of town does the pace lag a bit.

25477,A1L220BNTP6WYZ,0780021185,Charles Hugh Smith,"[2, 3]","This 1963 film starring Toshiro Mifune as the executive about to make his big takeover move, and Tatsuya Nakadai as the afflicted medical intern who kidnaps his son, is a film classic for a number of reasons. Number one is the cast; I must have seen this movie at least 3 times, and only now did I recognize Nakadai as the kidnapper. Though often cast as a psychopath (Sword of Doom being the prime example), Nakadai shows an amazing emotional range in the final scene, a conversation between the hero Mifune and the psychopathic villain Nakadai. (Interestingly, Mifune was also the heroic samurai sensei in Sword of Doom.)While High and Low is generally viewed as a morality play married to a police procedural, its most fascinating subtexts relate to Japanese postwar society. The ""high and low"" has at least four references: one, to the geography of the city, in which Mifune's mansion occupies the top of a prominent hill, while the criminal's hovel is in the lower-class flatlands; two, to the two protagonists' morals; three, to Mifune's ethical stance vis a vis his greedy colleagues, and four, to the Japanese society which created the highs and lows of social standing, twisted ethics and underclass resentment which fuel the story.The Nakadai character has viewed Mifune's ""house on the hill"" for years, building a classist resentment against Mifune's wealth and status. This fundamentally social resentment is what fuels his brilliant kidnapping plan, not a personal enmity to Mifune's hard-charging but still highly ethical executive.There is another subtle irony to this ""high and low;"" the Mifune character is a working-class guy who rose from shoemaker's apprentice to executive through hard work, attention to quality and pure drive. He simply doesn't deserve the resentment-fed tragedy which befalls him.Several of the most compelling scenes occur when Nakadai seeks out a personal meeting with the executive whose life he has effectively ruined. In the first instance, Mifune stares plaintively into a shop window filled with womens's shoes. On the night of the kidnapping, he was about to wrest control of the shoe company to which he'd devoted his entire working life from money-grubbing executives who cared not for quality but only for a quick profit. Nakadai approaches Mifune and asks for a light. Nothing else transpires, but we experience the creepiness of the criminal interacting with his unknowing prey.The irony of the scene is that Mifune was the ethical businessman, the lone stand-out for quality amidst a greed-driven coterie of other executives. If this isn't a statement on the business mores of postwar Japan, what is? Destroyed by the huge ransom demanded by Nakadai's character, Mifune has sunk to window-shopping to keep his conection to his craft--shoe-making--alive.In the final scene, Nakadai has been apprehended and jailed; he awaits execution for the killing of the two junkies he manipulated into helping him with the kidnapping and ransom collection. He has requested a meeting with Mifune, to explain himself and to confess the raging resentment and madness at his core. Mifune is stoic; having lost everything, including his high-class house on the hill, he is starting over with a smaller shoe company.It is a bleak yet powerful ending to a caustically social tragedy; a young man, full of promise as a medical intern, turns to kidnapping to destroy a wealthy man he envies from afar. In a truly 60s twist, the greedy, heartless executives win and Mifune loses, due to the intervention of a resentful lower-class person with a terribly heavy emotional burden.The policemen's sympathy for Mifune is also an intriguing subtext; one states outright that though he typically has little sympathy for the wealthy, the fact that Mifune sacrificed his entire fortune to save the son of his lowly chauffeur has moved him deeply. Not to ruin the movie for you, but the plot twist occurs right on schedule at minute 20 (standard screenwriting technique calls for the first plot point at 20 minutes): the kidnapper thinks he has kidnapped the rich executive's son, but he has mistakenly taken the son'e playmate, the son of the lowly chauffeur. Mifune must then decide, in a classic morality play, whether to execute his takeover of the shoe company or save his underling's son. He chooses to sacrifice his fortune to save the innocent boy. As a feeling human being, he has no choice, and it is this realization which Mifune imparts so brilliantly.",5,fascinating subtexts of a film classic,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,4487,"['1963', 'film', 'starring', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'executive', 'make', 'big', 'takeover', 'move', 'Tatsuya', 'Nakadai', 'afflicted', 'medical', 'intern', 'who', 'son', 'film', 'classic', 'number', 'reasons', 'Number', 'one', 'cast', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'least', '3', 'times', 'only', 'now', 'did', 'recognize', 'Nakadai', 'kidnapper', 'Though', 'often', 'cast', 'psychopath', 'Sword', 'Doom', 'being', 'prime', 'example', 'Nakadai', 'amazing', 'emotional', 'range', 'final', 'scene', 'conversation', 'hero', 'Mifune', 'psychopathic', 'villain', 'Nakadai', 'Interestingly', 'Mifune', 'was', 'also', 'heroic', 'samurai', 'sensei', 'Sword', 'Doom', 'High', 'Low', 'generally', 'viewed', 'morality', 'play', 'married', 'police', 'procedural', 'most', 'fascinating', 'subtexts', 'relate', 'Japanese', 'postwar', 'society', 'high', 'low', 'least', 'four', 'references', 'one', 'geography', 'city', 'Mifune', 'mansion', 'top', 'prominent', 'hill', 'criminal', 'hovel', 'lower-class', 'flatlands', 'two', 'two', 'protagonists', 'morals', 'three', 'Mifune', 'ethical', 'stance', 'vis', 'vis', 'greedy', 'colleagues', 'four', 'Japanese', 'society', 'created', 'highs', 'lows', 'social', 'standing', 'twisted', 'ethics', 'underclass', 'resentment', 'story.The', 'Nakadai', 'character', 'viewed', 'Mifune', 'house', 'hill', 'years', 'building', 'classist', 'resentment', 'Mifune', 'wealth', 'status', 'fundamentally', 'social', 'resentment', 'what', 'brilliant', 'kidnapping', 'plan', 'not', 'personal', 'enmity', 'Mifune', 'hard-charging', 'still', 'highly', 'ethical', 'executive.There', 'subtle', 'irony', 'high', 'low', 'Mifune', 'character', 'working-class', 'guy', 'who', 'rose', 'shoemaker', 'apprentice', 'executive', 'hard', 'work', 'attention', 'quality', 'pure', 'drive', 'simply', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'resentment-fed', 'tragedy', 'him.Several', 'most', 'compelling', 'scenes', 'occur', 'when', 'Nakadai', 'out', 'personal', 'meeting', 'executive', 'life', 'effectively', 'ruined', 'first', 'instance', 'Mifune', 'plaintively', 'shop', 'window', 'filled', 'womens', 'shoes', 'night', 'kidnapping', 'was', 'about', 'wrest', 'control', 'shoe', 'company', ""'d"", 'devoted', 'entire', 'working', 'life', 'money-grubbing', 'executives', 'who', 'cared', 'not', 'quality', 'only', 'quick', 'profit', 'Nakadai', 'Mifune', 'light', 'Nothing', 'else', 'experience', 'creepiness', 'criminal', 'interacting', 'unknowing', 'prey.The', 'irony', 'scene', 'Mifune', 'was', 'ethical', 'businessman', 'lone', 'stand-out', 'quality', 'amidst', 'greed-driven', 'coterie', 'other', 'executives', ""n't"", 'statement', 'business', 'mores', 'postwar', 'Japan', 'what', 'Destroyed', 'huge', 'ransom', 'demanded', 'Nakadai', 'character', 'Mifune', 'sunk', 'window-shopping', 'keep', 'conection', 'craft', 'shoe-making', 'final', 'scene', 'Nakadai', 'been', 'apprehended', 'jailed', 'execution', 'killing', 'two', 'junkies', 'manipulated', 'helping', 'kidnapping', 'ransom', 'collection', 'requested', 'meeting', 'Mifune', 'explain', 'confess', 'raging', 'resentment', 'madness', 'core', 'Mifune', 'stoic', 'having', 'lost', 'everything', 'including', 'high-class', 'house', 'hill', 'starting', 'over', 'smaller', 'shoe', 'company.It', 'bleak', 'yet', 'powerful', 'ending', 'caustically', 'social', 'tragedy', 'young', 'man', 'full', 'promise', 'medical', 'intern', 'kidnapping', 'destroy', 'wealthy', 'man', 'afar', 'truly', '60s', 'twist', 'greedy', 'heartless', 'executives', 'win', 'Mifune', 'due', 'intervention', 'resentful', 'lower-class', 'person', 'terribly', 'heavy', 'emotional', 'burden.The', 'policemen', 'sympathy', 'Mifune', 'also', 'intriguing', 'subtext', 'one', 'states', 'outright', 'typically', 'little', 'sympathy', 'wealthy', 'fact', 'Mifune', 'sacrificed', 'entire', 'fortune', 'save', 'son', 'lowly', 'chauffeur', 'moved', 'deeply', 'Not', 'ruin', 'movie', 'plot', 'twist', 'right', 'schedule', 'minute', '20', 'standard', 'screenwriting', 'technique', 'first', 'plot', 'point', '20', 'minutes', 'kidnapper', 'kidnapped', 'rich', 'executive', 'son', 'mistakenly', 'taken', 'son', 'e', 'playmate', 'son', 'lowly', 'chauffeur', 'Mifune', 'must', 'then', 'decide', 'classic', 'morality', 'play', 'execute', 'takeover', 'shoe', 'company', 'save', 'underling', 'son', 'sacrifice', 'fortune', 'save', 'innocent', 'boy', 'feeling', 'human', 'being', 'choice', 'realization', 'Mifune', 'imparts', 'so', 'brilliantly']",N/A
25478,AX8SWWB9837TA,0780021185,Chris Peters,"[2, 3]","Another great masterpiece from Akira Kurosawa.  High and Low tells the tale of a rich Japanese businessman who is blackmailed right when he is about to make a hostile takeover of his partners.  Toshiro Mifune is incredible as the lead character, never giving his audience the slightest clue as to what he might do - will he spend the ransom money which would rescue his son but also make him penniless?  You will truly be second guessing Mifune throughout the movie.  Kurosawa intelligently limits his creative camera angles and pacing, giving the story a modern, realistic feel.  The film never quite shakes loose of its stage roots, but this is acceptable given the material.

25479,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,0780021185,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[1, 1]","Just my two cents here.  Kurosawa gets a lot of flack for not having been versatile.  I think that people who say that are probably just exposed to Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, Ran, Kagemusha, and Rashomon.  Kurosawa directed many stunning films in various genres.  This is surely one of his stand out films from the non-feudal Japanese settings.The movie revolves around a kidnapping; but that's the surface.  The first half is about the kidnapping, the ransom, the investigation, and the kidnapped child's father and father's boss.  The second half goes into a murky depth showing the criminal and his/her environment.  (Hence: High and Low)The shooting is masterful, one would expect no less of Kurosawa.  The acting is among the best in any Kurosawa film.  I have seen every one of his films and this belongs with The Bad Sleep Well among his most underrated and under-appreciated films.",5,Toshiro Mifune at his best!,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,895,"['Just', 'two', 'cents', 'here', 'Kurosawa', 'lot', 'flack', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'versatile', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'are', 'probably', 'just', 'exposed', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'Yojimbo', 'Sanjuro', 'Ran', 'Kagemusha', 'Rashomon', 'Kurosawa', 'directed', 'many', 'stunning', 'films', 'various', 'genres', 'surely', 'one', 'stand', 'out', 'films', 'non-feudal', 'Japanese', 'settings.The', 'movie', 'around', 'kidnapping', 'surface', 'first', 'half', 'kidnapping', 'ransom', 'investigation', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'father', 'father', 'boss', 'second', 'half', 'murky', 'depth', 'showing', 'criminal', 'environment', 'Hence', 'High', 'Low', 'shooting', 'masterful', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'less', 'Kurosawa', 'acting', 'best', 'Kurosawa', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'films', 'Bad', 'Sleep', 'Well', 'most', 'underrated', 'under-appreciated', 'films']",N/A
25480,A18D0R137EYS6C,0780021185,Clinton Enlow,"[2, 2]","While I generally view Kurosawa's original Stray Dog as another in long line of his genre setting triumphs, High And Low is his masterpiece of the crime genre. High and Low was made in the middle of his career before Kurosawa's decline when his failure with Dodeskaden and getting kicked off of Tora, Tora, Tora caused him to go on hiatus for nearly ten years and drove him to attempt suicide. Thankfully Russia came along with a chance to adapt Dersu Uzala a film I wish was given the respectable double dip that Criterion is doing with their earlier releases.I discovered High and Low early in my exploration of Kurosawa mainly overlooking it because it wasn't a samurai period film something I thought He had excelled in and only that. It happened by chance that I borrowed the orginal Criterion disc from a friend at work and quickly became engorged in any film made by the master. This film has the earmarks of Kurosawa film with social commentary, great characters, amazing black and white photography (the liner for the dvd makes mentions of lighting on the killers mirrored sunglasses during the finale), and scenes that are almost acted without any dialogue. Plus its just a great damn thriller.High and Low was adapted from a 87th precinct novel from the late Ed McBain (Evan Hunter). It transplants the story from America to Yokohama in the middle of the summer. As the film begins shoe maker executive Gondo is having a meeting with subordinates where he outlines his plans to take over the company. The others are flummoxed as they want to create flimmsier shoes at cheaper prices and plan ..ping Gondo. Things come to a head when Gondo gets a phone call from a man who says He's kidnapped his son who was recently playing with the chauffers son around the house. Unfortunately his son comes in and as it turns out the chauffers son has been the one kidnapped. The Kidnapper discovers this also but won't budge on the ransom demand so Gondo is set up with a moral choice. He calls the cops despite the danger it poses but trys whatever He can to figure out a way not to pay the ransom.The cops arrive and then begins the first half of the film as a plan is devised to get back both the boy and the money. The second half of the film involves the police investigation trying to find out who the kidnapper is ending with a chase through the city in the night through back alleys and bars filled with foreigners all with as little dialogue as possible depending mainly on the emotions of the actors to sell the intensity. While the first half is more character driven the last half of the film is more procedural which of course is what appealed to me more.Being the fan that I am the only way to describe High and Low would be to use the word impeccable. Its not the most loved Kurosawa film (something I'd disagree with) but it has the hallmarks of greatness in my opinion. While I love the procedural half of the film, the first set only in the Gondo house is intense thanks to the acting and directing talent. One of the great things that I've always loved about Kurosawa is his use of long takes and this helps build the intensity of the scenes as the camera flows around the living room watching the characters. On the acting side you have the two of Kurosawa's main group. Toshiro Mifune is always able to play intensity with bravado and flair but as the film progresses you can see him begining to falter in his plans not to pay the ransom demand. At the end He's given up everything He gained, all his riches gone until He's back to mowing his own lawn in one of the famous images of the film like He's trying to hold back the inevitable. The second actor is Tatsuya Nakadai as Chief Detective Tokoda. Nakadai worked on the last of Kurosawa's masterpieces (being Kagemusha and Ran) and this was a great almost simple performance. Tokoda heading up the investigation isn't a renegade cop character mostly simply dressed and handsome. But Nakadai has a commanding presence that demands you to watch him. I can't really describe what makes Nakadai Mifune's perfect accomplice in the film.In the end its a perfect film in my mind, one of the few I wouldn't hesitate to brand it as such.I was speaking on my original experience with the film which was Criterions orignal release. Around the time Criterion double dipped Seven Samurai and gave it the treatment it deserved I hoped they'd do the same for High and Low as the picture on the original disc was slightly cropped at the sides. On this set they've thankfully corrected that issue while adding some great features like a commentary from Stephen Prince and more of the It Is Wonderful to Create series that they've included on almost all of their Kurosawa releases. Its strange that original Criterion is still listed for sale as this is the only set worth buying in my opinion.",5,High and Low,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,4849,"['generally', 'view', 'Kurosawa', 'original', 'Stray', 'Dog', 'long', 'line', 'genre', 'setting', 'triumphs', 'High', 'Low', 'masterpiece', 'crime', 'genre', 'High', 'Low', 'was', 'made', 'middle', 'career', 'Kurosawa', 'decline', 'when', 'failure', 'Dodeskaden', 'getting', 'kicked', 'Tora', 'Tora', 'Tora', 'caused', 'go', 'hiatus', 'nearly', 'ten', 'years', 'drove', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'Thankfully', 'Russia', 'came', 'along', 'chance', 'adapt', 'Dersu', 'Uzala', 'film', 'wish', 'was', 'given', 'respectable', 'double', 'dip', 'Criterion', 'doing', 'earlier', 'releases.I', 'discovered', 'High', 'Low', 'early', 'exploration', 'Kurosawa', 'mainly', 'overlooking', 'was', ""n't"", 'samurai', 'period', 'film', 'something', 'thought', 'had', 'excelled', 'only', 'happened', 'chance', 'borrowed', 'orginal', 'Criterion', 'disc', 'friend', 'work', 'quickly', 'became', 'engorged', 'film', 'made', 'master', 'film', 'earmarks', 'Kurosawa', 'film', 'social', 'commentary', 'great', 'characters', 'amazing', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'liner', 'dvd', 'mentions', 'lighting', 'killers', 'mirrored', 'sunglasses', 'finale', 'scenes', 'are', 'almost', 'acted', 'dialogue', 'just', 'great', 'damn', 'thriller.High', 'Low', 'was', 'adapted', '87th', 'precinct', 'novel', 'late', 'Ed', 'McBain', 'Evan', 'Hunter', 'story', 'America', 'Yokohama', 'middle', 'summer', 'film', 'shoe', 'maker', 'executive', 'Gondo', 'having', 'meeting', 'subordinates', 'where', 'plans', 'take', 'over', 'company', 'others', 'are', 'flummoxed', 'want', 'create', 'flimmsier', 'shoes', 'cheaper', 'prices', 'plan', '..ping', 'Gondo', 'Things', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'Gondo', 'phone', 'call', 'man', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'recently', 'playing', 'chauffers', 'son', 'house', 'Unfortunately', 'son', 'out', 'chauffers', 'son', 'been', 'one', 'kidnapped', 'Kidnapper', 'also', 'wo', ""n't"", 'budge', 'ransom', 'demand', 'so', 'Gondo', 'set', 'up', 'moral', 'choice', 'cops', 'danger', 'trys', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'not', 'pay', 'ransom.The', 'cops', 'arrive', 'then', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'plan', 'devised', 'get', 'back', 'boy', 'money', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'police', 'investigation', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'kidnapper', 'ending', 'chase', 'city', 'night', 'back', 'alleys', 'bars', 'filled', 'foreigners', 'as', 'little', 'dialogue', 'possible', 'depending', 'mainly', 'emotions', 'actors', 'sell', 'intensity', 'first', 'half', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'more', 'procedural', 'course', 'what', 'appealed', 'more.Being', 'fan', 'am', 'only', 'way', 'describe', 'High', 'Low', 'would', 'be', 'use', 'word', 'impeccable', 'not', 'most', 'loved', 'Kurosawa', 'film', 'something', ""'d"", 'disagree', 'hallmarks', 'greatness', 'opinion', 'love', 'procedural', 'half', 'film', 'first', 'set', 'only', 'Gondo', 'house', 'intense', 'thanks', 'acting', 'directing', 'talent', 'One', 'great', 'things', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'Kurosawa', 'use', 'long', 'build', 'intensity', 'scenes', 'camera', 'living', 'room', 'watching', 'characters', 'acting', 'side', 'have', 'two', 'Kurosawa', 'main', 'group', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'always', 'able', 'play', 'intensity', 'bravado', 'flair', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'begining', 'falter', 'plans', 'not', 'pay', 'ransom', 'demand', 'end', 'given', 'up', 'everything', 'gained', 'riches', 'gone', 'back', 'mowing', 'own', 'lawn', 'one', 'famous', 'images', 'film', 'trying', 'hold', 'back', 'inevitable', 'second', 'actor', 'Tatsuya', 'Nakadai', 'Chief', 'Detective', 'Tokoda', 'Nakadai', 'worked', 'last', 'Kurosawa', 'masterpieces', 'being', 'Kagemusha', 'Ran', 'was', 'great', 'almost', 'simple', 'performance', 'Tokoda', 'heading', 'up', 'investigation', ""n't"", 'renegade', 'cop', 'character', 'mostly', 'simply', 'dressed', 'handsome', 'Nakadai', 'commanding', 'presence', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'describe', 'what', 'Nakadai', 'Mifune', 'perfect', 'accomplice', 'film.In', 'end', 'perfect', 'film', 'mind', 'one', 'few', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'brand', 'such.I', 'was', 'speaking', 'original', 'experience', 'film', 'was', 'Criterions', 'orignal', 'release', 'time', 'Criterion', 'double', 'dipped', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'gave', 'treatment', 'deserved', 'hoped', ""'d"", 'do', 'same', 'High', 'Low', 'picture', 'original', 'disc', 'was', 'slightly', 'cropped', 'sides', 'set', ""'ve"", 'thankfully', 'corrected', 'issue', 'adding', 'great', 'features', 'commentary', 'Stephen', 'Prince', 'more', 'Wonderful', 'Create', 'series', ""'ve"", 'included', 'almost', 'Kurosawa', 'strange', 'original', 'Criterion', 'still', 'listed', 'sale', 'only', 'set', 'worth', 'buying', 'opinion']",N/A

I think it probably is my favorite Kurosawa film.Toshiro Mifune plays a top executive in a shoe company who is secretly planning to take over the company. He wants to keep making quality shoes and gradually expand the market. The other executives want to make cheaper shoes and take advantage of the company's reputation. Mifune has raised every yen he can, including using his house, for the buyout, but his son is kidnapped. For the ransome he'll need all the money he's raised. He's prepared to do this for the sake of his son.Then he finds out that the kidnappers made a mistake. They kidnapped his driver's son, who is the same age as his own. What a terrible moral dilemma. Would you or I give up every dime we had to save a neighbor's or an employee's son? Mifune does, and this act has a great effect on the police and the public.The first half of the movie takes place in his house on a hill while all this unfolds. The second half is the chase to find the boy before he's killed and to capture the kidnapper. We move from the intensity of the dilemma unfolding in Mifune's home to the gritty business of the search which takes us into some of the lowest parts of the Japanese underworld.Mifune is powerful in the role of the father, at first torn by the decision he has to make, then commited to finding his driver's son. Tatsuya Nakadai plays the detective, handsome, smooth, professional, and ultimately deeply touched by Mifune's integrity. Years later Nakadai played the leads in Kurosawa's Kagemusha and Ran.

25482,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,0780021185,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 2]","High And Low (Tengoku To Jigoku; literally Heaven And Hell) is a film that is so perfect in every detail it shows how utterly silly similar Hollywood takes on the matter are, and were: think Ron Howard's and Mel Gibson's silly 1996 flick Ransom, or any of Alfred Hitchcock's crime dramas from the 1950s or 1960s. Yes, critics often resort to the copout that Hitchcock was not deep, but technically was great. True, to a degree, but one need only watch the rail car sequence in this film to see how staid, old fashioned, conservative, and utterly quaint Hitchcock's ideas on crime were. The truth is that Hitchcock really had no idea what drove criminals. Kurosawa did. To the Englishman, crimes were Freudian impelled, and committed by people with manifest things wrong with them. The claim he made was one merely had to be adept at spotting such things. Kurosawa shows that crime (as it does in reality) emerges from complex and obscure things. Its evildoers are often manifestly plain and their reasons never discernible. What drives High And Low to such greatness is that, even after all is revealed, the criminal apprehended, and the film at an end, the viewer is still pondering- in the best sense, and still unable to grasp how and why such a thing occurred. Yet, the film only gets to that point after peerless artistic and technical means.The peerless screenplay was written by Kurosawa, Eijir Hisaita, Ryuzo Kikushima, and Hideo Oguni, adapted from the 1959 pulp novel King's Ransom. The book was written by Ed McBain, pseudonym for Evan Hunter, which was the adopted name of Salvatore Albert Lombino. Using a variety of pen names, McBain penned pulp crime books that were three or four levels below Mickey Spillane. As Hunter, he wrote The Blackboard Jungle and the screen adaptation for Hitchcock's The Birds- probably the best film the great profile ever made. In short, under whatever guise, Hunter was no budding John Steinbeck. This makes the adaptation by Hisaita all the more impressive, for, while I never read the novel the film is derived from, as a youth I read a few McBain books and, even then, saw they were cardboard- both character- and plot-wise. Most criticisms of the film claim that, aside from the basic premise, the two works deviate greatly. One can thus likely (according to Occam's Razor) attribute the positives in this 143 minute (but swift paced) long film to the work of Hisaita and company, not McBain....Overall, High And Low is a great film, whose Americanized, like Vittorio De Sica's Ladri Di Biciclette; whose title has historically been mistranslated as The Bicycle Thief rather than Bicycle Thieves, it is a fortuitous gaffe, for the `wrong' translated title is far more evocative and less strident than its literal translation. The film's exploration and criticisms of social aspects of times and places past is timeless and the film shows how a great artist can mine true cosmic depth out of the must mundane of propositions that lesser artists make hackwork out of, such as Reiko's banal query: `What good is success if you lose your humanity?' The real tragedy of this film is not what occurs within its frame, but that even such banalities are not asked today in the modern world of filmmaking, much less extrapolated upon in such a proud and grand way. Akira Kurosawa was a giant of cinema, and world art, in general; a man whose output will be seen, centuries hence, the way Shakespeare's and Goya's are today, but that gigantism was built upon and borne by the desire to explore even the minutest moments of the human condition- not in a weepy, bleeding heart liberal sort of way, but in a deep, penetrating way that celebrated the best part of the human being: his intellect. In today's dumbed down Politically Correct society, such films are not only not made, but not even contemplated. When the history of turn of the millennium cinema is finally written, one of the key questions asked will be what happened to the basic striving for high art? Why did it become gauche to want to excel, and to want to treat an audience with respect? Of course, the film asks these same sorts of queries (along with the more banal ones it subverts) in regards to its lead character's professions, which only shows how great art recapitulates itself again and again, regardless of the changing circumstances of history, while bad art is entombed by its stolidity. Great artists know this, and, while glaring at his own reflection, at film's end, one senses a more peaceable Kingo Gondo knows it, too. Or, at least we hope he does. That we do says as much of Kurosawa as it does of us and our newer times.",5,Masterpiece,1224288000,"10 18, 2008",2008,4646,"['High', 'Low', 'Tengoku', 'Jigoku', 'literally', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'film', 'so', 'perfect', 'detail', 'how', 'utterly', 'silly', 'similar', 'Hollywood', 'matter', 'are', 'were', 'think', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'silly', '1996', 'flick', 'Ransom', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'crime', 'dramas', '1950s', '1960s', 'Yes', 'critics', 'often', 'resort', 'copout', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'not', 'deep', 'technically', 'was', 'great', 'True', 'degree', 'one', 'need', 'only', 'watch', 'rail', 'car', 'sequence', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'staid', 'old', 'fashioned', 'conservative', 'utterly', 'quaint', 'Hitchcock', 'ideas', 'crime', 'were', 'truth', 'Hitchcock', 'really', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'drove', 'criminals', 'Kurosawa', 'did', 'Englishman', 'crimes', 'were', 'Freudian', 'impelled', 'committed', 'people', 'manifest', 'things', 'wrong', 'claim', 'made', 'was', 'one', 'merely', 'had', 'be', 'adept', 'spotting', 'such', 'things', 'Kurosawa', 'crime', 'reality', 'complex', 'obscure', 'things', 'evildoers', 'are', 'often', 'manifestly', 'plain', 'reasons', 'never', 'discernible', 'What', 'High', 'Low', 'such', 'greatness', 'even', 'revealed', 'criminal', 'apprehended', 'film', 'end', 'viewer', 'still', 'pondering-', 'best', 'sense', 'still', 'unable', 'grasp', 'how', 'why', 'such', 'thing', 'occurred', 'film', 'only', 'point', 'peerless', 'artistic', 'technical', 'means.The', 'peerless', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Kurosawa', 'Eijir', 'Hisaita', 'Ryuzo', 'Kikushima', 'Hideo', 'Oguni', 'adapted', '1959', 'pulp', 'novel', 'King', 'Ransom', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'Ed', 'McBain', 'pseudonym', 'Evan', 'Hunter', 'was', 'adopted', 'name', 'Salvatore', 'Albert', 'Lombino', 'Using', 'variety', 'pen', 'names', 'McBain', 'penned', 'pulp', 'crime', 'books', 'were', 'three', 'four', 'levels', 'Mickey', 'Spillane', 'Hunter', 'wrote', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Hitchcock', 'Birds-', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'great', 'profile', 'ever', 'made', 'short', 'guise', 'Hunter', 'was', 'budding', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'adaptation', 'Hisaita', 'more', 'impressive', 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'film', 'derived', 'youth', 'read', 'few', 'McBain', 'books', 'even', 'then', 'saw', 'were', 'cardboard-', 'character-', 'plot-wise', 'Most', 'criticisms', 'film', 'claim', 'aside', 'basic', 'premise', 'two', 'works', 'deviate', 'greatly', 'One', 'can', 'thus', 'likely', 'according', 'Occam', 'Razor', 'attribute', 'positives', '143', 'minute', 'swift', 'paced', 'long', 'film', 'work', 'Hisaita', 'company', 'not', 'McBain', '.Overall', 'High', 'Low', 'great', 'film', 'Americanized', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'Ladri', 'Di', 'Biciclette', 'title', 'historically', 'been', 'mistranslated', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'rather', 'Bicycle', 'Thieves', 'fortuitous', 'gaffe', 'wrong', 'translated', 'title', 'far', 'more', 'evocative', 'less', 'strident', 'literal', 'translation', 'film', 'exploration', 'criticisms', 'social', 'aspects', 'times', 'places', 'past', 'timeless', 'film', 'how', 'great', 'artist', 'can', 'mine', 'true', 'cosmic', 'depth', 'must', 'mundane', 'propositions', 'lesser', 'artists', 'make', 'hackwork', 'such', 'Reiko', 'banal', 'query', 'What', 'good', 'success', 'lose', 'humanity', 'real', 'tragedy', 'film', 'not', 'what', 'frame', 'even', 'such', 'banalities', 'are', 'not', 'asked', 'today', 'modern', 'world', 'filmmaking', 'much', 'less', 'extrapolated', 'upon', 'such', 'proud', 'grand', 'way', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'was', 'giant', 'cinema', 'world', 'art', 'general', 'man', 'output', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'centuries', 'hence', 'way', 'Shakespeare', 'Goya', 'are', 'today', 'gigantism', 'was', 'built', 'borne', 'desire', 'explore', 'even', 'minutest', 'moments', 'human', 'condition-', 'not', 'weepy', 'bleeding', 'heart', 'liberal', 'sort', 'way', 'deep', 'penetrating', 'way', 'celebrated', 'best', 'part', 'human', 'being', 'intellect', 'today', 'dumbed', 'Politically', 'Correct', 'society', 'such', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'made', 'not', 'even', 'contemplated', 'When', 'history', 'turn', 'millennium', 'cinema', 'finally', 'written', 'one', 'key', 'questions', 'asked', 'will', 'be', 'what', 'happened', 'basic', 'striving', 'high', 'art', 'Why', 'did', 'become', 'gauche', 'want', 'excel', 'want', 'treat', 'audience', 'respect', 'course', 'film', 'same', 'sorts', 'queries', 'more', 'banal', 'ones', 'regards', 'lead', 'character', 'professions', 'only', 'how', 'great', 'art', 'again', 'again', 'regardless', 'changing', 'circumstances', 'history', 'bad', 'art', 'entombed', 'stolidity', 'Great', 'artists', 'know', 'glaring', 'own', 'reflection', 'film', 'end', 'one', 'more', 'peaceable', 'Kingo', 'Gondo', 'too', 'least', 'hope', 'do', 'much', 'Kurosawa', 'newer', 'times']",N/A
25483,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0780021185,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[9, 9]","Based on King's Ransom by Ed McBain, High And Low (original title Heaven And Hell) tells the story of Gondo (Toshiro Mifune), head of National Shoes' factory production, who believes in producing quality shoes that are expensive but durable.  He is ready to take a controlling interest in his company to prevent from being kicked out of the company when he receives a phone call saying his son has been kidnapped and to fork over 30 million yen.  His son Jun, fortunately, returns from playing outside with Shinichi, the chauffeur's son, who is now nowhere to be seen.  That changes nothing, as the kidnapper still demands the ransom.He calls the police, who come in discretely in one of the cleverest methods I've ever seen.  Led by Inspector Tokura and aided by Taguchi, a burly bald man known as the Bo'sun, they prove to be ideal policemen, dedicated, rational, and clever.Gondo adamantly refuses.  He has mortgaged everything, including the luxurious house on the hill he and his family live to get the shares.  Paying the ransom will put them all out on the street.  The police are accomodating, saying that it's important to rescue the child, but not by sacrificing Gondo.  However, Gondo's right-hand man Kawanishi has sold him out, informing his colleagues of his plans.  Gondo's dreams have been destroyed, so he agrees to pay the ransom.The drama can be divided into three parts.  First, the kidnapping, Gondo's refusal then agreeing to pay, and the police coming over to advise him.  The second part has Shinichi being released and goes into high-level detective drama mode as the police use evidence, deductive reasoning, and clues that will help them catch the kidnapper, and three, the trap the police set out for the killer.  It's part two that's the best.  The Japanese police's teamwork, skills in chasing down and analyzing clues, and the cooperation shown by the public, denotes that the Japanese police are truly dedicated servants of the people, compared to the American police (q.v. Rodney King, Malice Green, Amadou Diallou).  The police in this movie are likable and honorable.  And when each development or clue is found, the excitement ratchets up a notch.Water is twice a symbol in this movie.  Gondo is taking a shower, the water running full blast after Kawanishi has betrayed him.  After this scene, he calls the bank to get the money per the kidnapper's demands.  Also, once he tosses the money again per the kidnapper's demands, he washes his face in a sink.  It's a cleansing; the first scene denotes his washing away the cold businessman for someone with humanity.  Indeed, when Shinichi is released, he rushes towards him as if he were his own son.  This was first touched on when his wife Reiko berates his worsening attitude.  &quot;Success isn't worth losing your humanity&quot; and she is right.  Gondo is thus reborn as someone with compassion, humility, and a soul, while being his own man as opposed to being a cog in the corporate wheel.  His sacrifice makes him a hero to the Japanese public.  And the scene where he refuses his post back at National Shoes after the media backlash at the company for firing him, elicits a secret smile from the Bo'sun, who usually wastes on love on the rich, but ends up admiring Gondo.Gondo also represents the ideal of quality goods Japan has become famous for.  In the opening, he is dead set against the cheap quality of shoes his colleagues propose making.  He says in response to his colleagues that shoes must wear out and are accessories just like hats and handbags that &quot;hats are decoration.  Shoes carry all your body weight.&quot;  He advocates making shoes that are durable yet stylish, expensive but profitable in the long run.  It's the Japanese business ideal versus America's disposable merchandise attitude.  Thus Kurosawa also advocates quality in material things as well as quality of the soul.High And Low is proof enough of Kurosawa's ability to film gendai-geki (or contemporary drama) as opposed to jidai-geki (stories that take place in the feudal, samurai era in the warring pre-Tokugawa period.)  Some will argue that it's nothing compared to The Seven Samurai or Throne Of Blood, but for its values of compassion, humanity, dedication, and ideal quality in spiritual and material things.",5,Humanity and compassion triumphs-for the life of one boy,1075593600,"02 1, 2004",2004,4298,"['Based', 'King', 'Ransom', 'Ed', 'McBain', 'High', 'Low', 'original', 'title', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'story', 'Gondo', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'head', 'National', 'Shoes', 'factory', 'production', 'who', 'producing', 'quality', 'shoes', 'are', 'expensive', 'durable', 'ready', 'take', 'controlling', 'interest', 'company', 'prevent', 'being', 'kicked', 'company', 'when', 'phone', 'call', 'saying', 'son', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'fork', '30', 'million', 'yen', 'son', 'Jun', 'fortunately', 'returns', 'playing', 'outside', 'Shinichi', 'chauffeur', 'son', 'who', 'now', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'nothing', 'kidnapper', 'still', 'ransom.He', 'police', 'who', 'come', 'discretely', 'one', 'cleverest', 'methods', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Led', 'Inspector', 'Tokura', 'aided', 'Taguchi', 'burly', 'bald', 'man', 'known', ""Bo'sun"", 'prove', 'be', 'ideal', 'policemen', 'dedicated', 'rational', 'adamantly', 'refuses', 'mortgaged', 'everything', 'including', 'luxurious', 'house', 'hill', 'family', 'live', 'get', 'shares', 'Paying', 'ransom', 'will', 'put', 'out', 'street', 'police', 'are', 'accomodating', 'saying', 'important', 'rescue', 'child', 'not', 'sacrificing', 'Gondo', 'However', 'Gondo', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Kawanishi', 'sold', 'out', 'informing', 'colleagues', 'plans', 'Gondo', 'dreams', 'have', 'been', 'destroyed', 'pay', 'ransom.The', 'drama', 'can', 'be', 'divided', 'three', 'parts', 'First', 'kidnapping', 'Gondo', 'refusal', 'then', 'agreeing', 'pay', 'police', 'coming', 'advise', 'second', 'part', 'Shinichi', 'being', 'released', 'high-level', 'detective', 'drama', 'mode', 'police', 'use', 'evidence', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'clues', 'will', 'help', 'catch', 'kidnapper', 'three', 'trap', 'police', 'set', 'out', 'killer', 'part', 'two', 'best', 'Japanese', 'police', 'teamwork', 'skills', 'chasing', 'down', 'analyzing', 'clues', 'cooperation', 'shown', 'public', 'Japanese', 'police', 'are', 'truly', 'dedicated', 'servants', 'people', 'compared', 'American', 'police', 'q.v', 'Rodney', 'King', 'Malice', 'Green', 'Amadou', 'Diallou', 'police', 'movie', 'are', 'likable', 'honorable', 'when', 'development', 'clue', 'found', 'excitement', 'up', 'notch.Water', 'twice', 'symbol', 'movie', 'Gondo', 'taking', 'shower', 'water', 'running', 'full', 'blast', 'Kawanishi', 'betrayed', 'scene', 'bank', 'get', 'money', 'kidnapper', 'demands', 'Also', 'once', 'money', 'again', 'kidnapper', 'demands', 'face', 'sink', 'cleansing', 'first', 'scene', 'washing', 'away', 'cold', 'businessman', 'someone', 'humanity', 'Indeed', 'when', 'Shinichi', 'released', 'towards', 'were', 'own', 'son', 'was', 'first', 'touched', 'when', 'wife', 'Reiko', 'worsening', 'attitude', 'quot', 'Success', ""n't"", 'worth', 'losing', 'humanity', 'quot', 'right', 'Gondo', 'thus', 'reborn', 'someone', 'compassion', 'humility', 'soul', 'being', 'own', 'man', 'opposed', 'being', 'cog', 'corporate', 'wheel', 'sacrifice', 'hero', 'Japanese', 'public', 'scene', 'where', 'post', 'back', 'National', 'Shoes', 'media', 'backlash', 'company', 'firing', 'secret', 'smile', ""Bo'sun"", 'who', 'usually', 'love', 'rich', 'up', 'admiring', 'Gondo.Gondo', 'also', 'ideal', 'quality', 'goods', 'Japan', 'become', 'famous', 'opening', 'dead', 'set', 'cheap', 'quality', 'shoes', 'colleagues', 'propose', 'making', 'response', 'colleagues', 'shoes', 'must', 'wear', 'out', 'are', 'accessories', 'just', 'hats', 'handbags', 'quot', 'hats', 'are', 'decoration', 'Shoes', 'carry', 'body', 'weight.', 'quot', 'making', 'shoes', 'are', 'durable', 'yet', 'stylish', 'expensive', 'profitable', 'long', 'run', 'Japanese', 'business', 'ideal', 'versus', 'America', 'disposable', 'merchandise', 'attitude', 'Thus', 'Kurosawa', 'also', 'quality', 'material', 'things', 'as', 'well', 'quality', 'soul.High', 'Low', 'proof', 'enough', 'Kurosawa', 'ability', 'film', 'gendai-geki', 'contemporary', 'drama', 'opposed', 'jidai-geki', 'stories', 'take', 'place', 'feudal', 'samurai', 'era', 'warring', 'pre-Tokugawa', 'period', 'will', 'argue', 'nothing', 'compared', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'Throne', 'Blood', 'values', 'compassion', 'humanity', 'dedication', 'ideal', 'quality', 'spiritual', 'material', 'things']",N/A

25485,A84TOOCIEF6FX,0780021185,David Webb,"[0, 0]","This is simply a great film by a great master! I first saw this on TV when I lived in Hawaii decades ago. It was the first Kurosawa film I had seen that was set in modern times. I was impressed at how well he directed such a ""contemporary"" (1960s)film. There are two major parts to this piece but there are strong moral dilemmas that flow through them both and unite them into a coherent whole. Part one is a highly charged drama that sets up part two. Gondo (Toshiro Mifune) is beset by two life-shattering choices that drive the action. He is forced to confront himself, and take stock of where he came from, how he got to the pinnacle of success, and how low he would go to stay there. Mifune gives a bravura performance, but everybody in the cast is superb. The suspense and tension build to the breaking point and culminate in one of the most moving scenes in cinema. The second part is a detective story that presages ""Law and Order"" and CSI in the way it details police practices. It also leads the viewer through some of the seamier urban flesh-pots of the time, and culminates in a final riveting scene that delivers the knock out combination punches of the film. This social message is as true today as it was in 1963, and is a caution that all societies should heed! The bonus disk that came with this package is truly worthwhile and gives invaluable insights into the actors and the way Kurosawa directed.

Interviews with Mifune (and the actor who plays the kidnapper), a documentary on the making of the film and an interesting (if intrusive) commentary track from Stephen Prince.But did anyone but me notice that this latest version of the film itself is not as crisp and clear as the former Criterion release of this film?That last version was a revelation; I saw things (background, details and all that)that I'd never noticed before, in astounding clarity. This version seems darker and not as high quality.  It was tough rating this one. I'm not sorry I bought it, but I'll probably go back to watching the original Criterion version when I want to see this film.  Disc One rates 3 stars.

25487,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0780021185,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[6, 7]","Another fantastic film from legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa and a wonderful performance by Toshiro Mifune!  A film that will truly have you at the edge of your seat!""Tengoku to Jigoku"" (which translates to ""Heaven and Hell"" but is known internationally as ""High and Low"") is a 1963 film that features another collaboration with actor Toshiro Mifune and is a film adaptation of Ed McBain's novel ""Kings Ransom"" that would focus on how one can become blackmailed despite not having direct involvement with a kidnapping.The film also is a statement from Kurosawa as children in Japan during the early '60s were being kidnapped and murdered and showing his distaste towards the Japanese law in which criminals would only get a few years of incarceration.With the film having been released in the late '90s on DVD by the Criterion Collection, the film was re-released with more special features and a better transfer in 2008.  So, here we are in 2011 and ""High and Low"" receives its Blu-ray release courtesy of the Criterion Collection, the first HD release of the title in America.VIDEO:""High and Low"" is presented  in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  As one would expect from a Blu-ray compared to a DVD version, you get more detail, better clarity and solid contrast.But for those who upgraded or purchased the 2008 re-release, the 2008 DVD was a pretty big difference as the Criterion Collection had improved their digital remastering and also with newer technology, were able to do a much better job in cleaning the video and audio.  For the 2011 Blu-ray release, you literally see details much clearly.Yes, the black levels continue to be nice and inky black, the grays and the white contrast levels look impeccable and also less blur and more detail in the faces of the characters.  We know that the characters are feeling hot and sweaty during the humid weather but we now see it clearly with the bead of sweat on the faces of the detectives.  The textures of the clothing or even the fabric on Gondo's walls, you can sense it.  You can see sheen off of Gondo's hair, you can see the detail of the wood on his bathroom door.And the picture quality, it looked much cleaner and yes, while it uses the same 2008 source, the fact that its HD makes a big difference in the film's overall PQ.For those wondering why the film shows B&W; and color, it's because the primary film is black and white but there is one scene where color is utilized.According to the Criterion Collection, this high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit 4K Datacine from a 35 mm fine-grain master positive and for the color sequence, a 35 mm interpositive.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""High and Low"" is presented with a lossless LPCM 4.0 surround soundtrack.  The dialogue is incredibly clear and it's great to have a DTS-HD Master Audio 4.0 soundtrack which gives us a solid balance of crystal clear dialogue, clear music and more clearer ambiance than the previous DVD release.According to the Criterion Collection, ""High and Low"" was remastered at 24-bit from the original 4-track stems.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.SPECIAL FEATURES:""High and Low - The Criterion Collection #24' on Blu-ray comes with the following special features:Audio commentary - Featuring an audio commentary by Akira Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince.Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create - (37:02) A thirty-seven minute documentary on the making of ""High and Low"", created as part of the Toho Masterworks series ""Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create"".Toshiro Mifune - (30:31) A rare video interview with actor Toshiro Mifune from 1981's TV Asahi show ""Tetsuko no Heya"" (Tetsuko's Room) as he is interviewed by Tetsuko Kuroyanagi about his international roles that were coming a the time, how the military photographer became an actor and more.Tsutomu Yamazaki - (19:03) A Criterion Collection exclusive video interview with actor Tsutomu Yamazaki (who plays the kidnapper) about how he got cast, working with Kurosawa and his role in the film.Trailers - Japanese Trailer - (3:38), Japanese teaser (1:54) and US Trailer (1:43)EXTRAS:""High and Low - The Criterion Collection #24' comes with a 38-page booklet which includes the following essays ""Between Heaven and Hell"" by Geoffrey O'Brien and ""On the Set of High and Low"" by Donald Richie.JUDGMENT CALL:""High and Low"" is an addictive, riveting and a fantastic film that will captivate you from beginning to end!For those who are only familiar with Kurosawa samurai films, I have no doubt in my mind that they will enjoy ""High and Low"" and be captivated by the the cinematography (Kurosawa utilizes the spacing in the film wonderfully) and also performances by Toshiro Mifune, Tatsuya Nakadai and Kyoko Nakagawa.The film's original title is ""Tengoku to Jigoku"" which literally means ""Heaven and Hell"".  The storyline of ""High and Low"" is presented in two connected storylines as ""Tengoku"" (Heaven/High) is depicted on the Gondo's home on top of the hill.  Right outside of the home, lurking below is where the poor live and characterized by others as ""Jigoku"" (hell/low).The first part of the film takes place in what the poor may think is ""Jigoku"", being rich and in heaven.  While the first half of the storyline focuses primarily inside the house of Gondo, everything is shot in the house, from Gondo's meeting with the executives, where the police are camping out in hopes to trace the call from the kidnapper and where discussion and arguments of what Gondo should do take place in the living room of the home.The second half of the film focuses on the detectives doing all they can to capture the kidnapper and we are given a glimpse of the world of the kidnapper.But the prevailing theme is very Kurosawa.  There is always a sense of a character who is admirable and determined and undeterred.  Gondo is an everyman who works for the people, he may be an executive but he prides himself on the quality of his shoes and will not let any other executive exploit the company for their own selfish reasons.  Throughout the first half of the film, we witness his struggle because he literally sacrificed everything, including his home in order to take control of the company, which he is doing it not just for his family but to ensure that the company makes quality shoes for the women who wear them.  But he knows the risks that sacrificing a child to move up in the corporate ladder can also mean his doom.But we know that losing all the money to pay off the ransom will not only save the child but it will definitely lead the family and Gondo to financial ruin and because the amount is so high, it would lead his family to eternal debt.And that is the intriguing factor that Kurosawa felt about Ed McBain's novel ""King's Ransom"".  The fact that the protagonist is being blackmailed by a kidnapper who kidnap a child that is not even his but yet affects his life greatly, rendering this powerful man to now becoming powerless.  Whichever decision he makes, it appears to be a double-edge sword.But by the second half of the film, we see the hard work that goes into helping Gondo by finding the kidnapper.  The kidnapper vs. the police storyline becomes the main focus of the second half.And for those not familiar with Japanese pop culture and entertainment, the images of a large police force working together for the same cause continues in television and film today as seen in the popular drama and film series""Odoru Daisousassen"" (Tokyo Bay Shakedown).  Whereas in a western film, we can see two or a handful of officers wanting to help the victim, in Japanese cinema, its the camaraderie of all officers (including from different precincts) willing to work together.The other topic which Kurosawa was also trying to drive home was his feelings of Japan's leniency in their laws for kidnappers.  In the '60s, children in Japan were kidnapped and murdered.  Today, many still have issues with Japanese law towards kidnapping, stalking and people not paying the price for the severity of the crime.This is emphasized in how the police will catch the kidnapper in ""High and Low"" and it is really clever writing and expose it to a mass audience in hopes to have changes in Japanese law.  Today, Japan is a believer in ""rehabilitation"" and in some cases, keeping these criminals incarcerated for a short time rather than keeping one behind-bars and serving a long sentence.In ""High and Low"", we get to see police and press work together in capturing the criminal.  But times have changed in Japan to the point that times have changed in Japan as seen in the Japanese 2000 TV Asahi drama series ""Tsugumi e"" in which a kidnapper kills the child of a couple and the family is literally victimized by the police and press.But there is no denying the efficacy of Kurosawa's ""High and Low"", especially with its powerful final scene which I rather not spoil for everyone.  Ever since I watched this film many years ago, the confrontation between Gondo and the kidnapper was brilliant and despite Kurosawa shooting various endings for the film, his decision to stay with both men, one-on-one was correct.So, now we come down to the question for those who purchase the 2008 DVD re-releae of ""High and Low"" and whether or not its worth it to upgrade to Blu-ray.For some people, there must be something additional added to a release in order for one to upgrade and for ""High and Low"", in terms of special features, there is nothing new that has been added.  But it comes down to one's appreciation of watching a wonderful film from a legendary filmmaker in HD.  Do you want the definitive version of ""High and Low""?  Then you definitely want to upgrade to Blu-ray because it looks spectacular on Blu-ray and the audio quality is crystal clear.Overall, It's great to have more Akira Kurosawa on Blu-ray courtesy of the Criterion Collection and for those who were only exposed to Kurosawa's samurai films will no doubt find a reason to be curious about ""High and Low"" as the first Criterion Collection Kurosawa release that is not a samurai film.But if you are a cineaste who enjoys great cinema, especially a film that grabs your attention from beginning to end, then this Blu-ray is simply a no-brainer and is a definite must-buy.""High and Low - The Criterion Collection #24' on Blu-ray is highly recommended!",5,"""High and Low"" is an addictive, riveting and a fantastic film that will captivate you from

25488,A280GY5UVUS2QH,0780021185,Doug Anderson,"[3, 3]","Like many of Kurosawas classics this one revolves around a mans dilemna as to whether he should act for selfish reasons or rise above his selfish concerns and act for a higher good. The man in the dilemna is a wealthy shoe manufacturer who is on the verge of buying out the company he works for once and for all when his son is kidnapped. When he believes it to be his own son that was kidnapped there is no doubt in his mind that he must pay but when then learns that it was not his son but one of his sons friends that was taken by mistake he then begins a long deliberation with himself about whether he should pay the sum which would ruin him and save the child or not pay and realize his lifes ambition. That part of the movie is a solid drama but the most interestying aspect to my mind is how well Kurosawa shows all the details the police detectives use in solving the crime. The movie was based on an an Ed McBain novel and so the police detail is precise and is the real point of originality here. Each detective has a task and he takes he must perform and only when all the seperate elements of the police force work together can the crime be solved. So the selfless detectives are presented in contrast to the selfish and wealthy industrialist. Best secenes in the movie are when detectives trail their suspect through the seedy nightclubs. One particular nightclub scene for me steals the show. In that nightclub Kurosawa really captures the wild happenings that were the cultural moment of 1963. Cool jazz plays in this jam packed club which attracts a cultural mix indulging in their favorite night club activities. The excitement of this scene makes for a great few minutes of cinema and it is one of those moments that separate the great directors from the merely adequate. The lurid appeal of the seedy side of life was felt by another director as well, Orson Welles and his Touch of Evil is a film which comes to mind in certain scenes of decadent squalor. Immensely enjoyable in parts. Great and very likeable cast of detectives.

25492,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,0780021185,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[7, 13]","All the excellent details and workings of this film are explained in the other reviews here, and very beautifully at that. Trouble with this film is that it is clearly not one of Kurosawa's finest of all the oeuvre d'art he has given us. I like to think and evaluate for myself, so to hell with ""Kurosawa scholars"". This is a critique.Kurosawa's wife once complained of how miserable life was with him at home when he wasn't working. This 1962 film shows the possibility that Kurosawa made it in order to escape ennui and his wife's wrath. Its opening scenes are certainly super-Oscar-worthy, with the tension of the expectant Gondo-san hovering near the telephone, awaiting the kidnapper's next call. And the smooth, perfectly acted relationship between all the characters who come to be involved is Kurosawa at his best.He follows with Hitchcockian shots and brilliant angles on Tokyo's Bullet train... I have no doubt Hitchcock envied those scenes. From the train, Gondo-san is to throw the two briefcases containing the ransom money. The police, with Gondo-san's help, have planted pink smoke bombs in the cases in the event the kidnapper attempts to burn them later... which he does, and in the midst of Kurosawa's usual black-and-white splendor rises deep pink smoke from one of Tokyo's garbage dump furnaces. Spielberg was so captivated by that scene he used it to great effect in ""Schindler's List"".And this brings us to the film being Kurosawa's most inspiring. Everything from ""Dragnet"" [following the brilliant cops as they dredge through evidence] to ""Gone Baby Gone"" [a horribly loused-up kidnapping scheme] seems to take from this film. A creepy shot with the kidnapper wearing his trademark sunglasses at night was scene copied in ""Sin City"" by Elijah Woods' character Kevin the psychopath.The trouble is that nearly a quarter of ""High and Low"" seems senseless, random filming in the busy night-time streets Of Tokyo. It seemed refreshing at first, but to drag it out as Kurosawa did seems totally pointless, and it is this nonsense that made the film go well over two hours' running time.The end is also so silly that it could not fail to be copied in every film with a prison-visit scene. Why does Gondo-san waste time visiting and listening to the ranting kidnapper in jail? What exactly is the kidnapper on, what is he all about? The trite answer of prosperity-versus-poverty is sickeningly thin. Kurosawa knew how to end films with a bang... and here he utterly fails.I can only say that I too was deeply moved by Mifune's deep, beautiful performance. I've never seen him act so well, great actor that he was, and I've seen almost everything he's ever done. In this film, he reminded me, for the first time, of my own father who was an auto mechanic/engineer, and my uncle, who was a cobbler/leathersmith. And by the way, it is true that in the old days cobblers were competent leathersmiths who made everything. The scene with Gondo-san re-working the Mexican-style briefcases reminded me of my uncle, who made belts and holsters for the Chicago PD for decades.See this film, own it as it is rarely mentioned in Kurosawa's best and for good reason, but buy it anyway. The tension, the modernity which gave birth to American crime-themed television, the too-few iconic shots that have been copied ever since... it's all worth it.Just recall, this in my opinion is N O T one of Kurosawa's strongest moments. For that, see ''Kagemusha'' or ''Dersu Uzala''.",4,NOT one of Akira Kurosawa's best; perhaps most copied.,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,3474,"['excellent', 'details', 'workings', 'film', 'are', 'explained', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'very', 'beautifully', 'Trouble', 'film', 'clearly', 'not', 'one', 'Kurosawa', 'finest', 'oeuvre', ""d'art"", 'given', 'like', 'think', 'evaluate', 'so', 'hell', 'Kurosawa', 'scholars', 'critique.Kurosawa', 'wife', 'once', 'complained', 'how', 'miserable', 'life', 'was', 'home', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', '1962', 'film', 'possibility', 'Kurosawa', 'made', 'order', 'escape', 'ennui', 'wife', 'wrath', 'opening', 'scenes', 'are', 'certainly', 'super-Oscar-worthy', 'tension', 'expectant', 'Gondo-san', 'hovering', 'telephone', 'awaiting', 'kidnapper', 'next', 'call', 'smooth', 'perfectly', 'acted', 'relationship', 'characters', 'who', 'come', 'be', 'involved', 'Kurosawa', 'best.He', 'Hitchcockian', 'shots', 'brilliant', 'angles', 'Tokyo', 'Bullet', 'train', 'have', 'doubt', 'Hitchcock', 'envied', 'scenes', 'train', 'Gondo-san', 'throw', 'two', 'briefcases', 'containing', 'ransom', 'money', 'police', 'Gondo-san', 'help', 'have', 'planted', 'pink', 'smoke', 'bombs', 'cases', 'event', 'kidnapper', 'burn', 'later', 'midst', 'Kurosawa', 'usual', 'black-and-white', 'splendor', 'deep', 'pink', 'smoke', 'one', 'Tokyo', 'garbage', 'dump', 'furnaces', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'so', 'captivated', 'scene', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'Schindler', 'List', 'film', 'being', 'Kurosawa', 'most', 'inspiring', 'Everything', 'Dragnet', '[', 'following', 'brilliant', 'cops', 'dredge', 'evidence', ']', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'horribly', 'loused-up', 'kidnapping', 'scheme', ']', 'take', 'film', 'creepy', 'shot', 'kidnapper', 'wearing', 'trademark', 'sunglasses', 'night', 'was', 'scene', 'copied', 'Sin', 'City', 'Elijah', 'Woods', 'character', 'Kevin', 'psychopath.The', 'trouble', 'nearly', 'quarter', 'High', 'Low', 'senseless', 'random', 'filming', 'busy', 'night-time', 'streets', 'Tokyo', 'seemed', 'refreshing', 'first', 'drag', 'out', 'Kurosawa', 'did', 'totally', 'pointless', 'nonsense', 'made', 'film', 'go', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'running', 'time.The', 'end', 'also', 'so', 'silly', 'could', 'not', 'fail', 'be', 'copied', 'film', 'prison-visit', 'scene', 'Why', 'Gondo-san', 'waste', 'time', 'visiting', 'listening', 'ranting', 'kidnapper', 'jail', 'What', 'exactly', 'kidnapper', 'what', 'trite', 'answer', 'prosperity-versus-poverty', 'sickeningly', 'thin', 'Kurosawa', 'knew', 'how', 'end', 'films', 'bang', 'here', 'utterly', 'fails.I', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'too', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'Mifune', 'deep', 'beautiful', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'act', 'so', 'well', 'great', 'actor', 'was', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'almost', 'everything', 'ever', 'done', 'film', 'reminded', 'first', 'time', 'own', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'auto', 'mechanic/engineer', 'uncle', 'who', 'was', 'cobbler/leathersmith', 'way', 'true', 'old', 'days', 'cobblers', 'were', 'competent', 'leathersmiths', 'who', 'made', 'everything', 'scene', 'Gondo-san', 're-working', 'Mexican-style', 'briefcases', 'reminded', 'uncle', 'who', 'made', 'belts', 'holsters', 'Chicago', 'PD', 'decades.See', 'film', 'own', 'rarely', 'mentioned', 'Kurosawa', 'best', 'good', 'reason', 'buy', 'anyway', 'tension', 'modernity', 'gave', 'birth', 'American', 'crime-themed', 'television', 'too-few', 'iconic', 'shots', 'have', 'been', 'copied', 'ever', 'worth', 'it.Just', 'recall', 'opinion', 'N', 'O', 'T', 'one', 'Kurosawa', 'strongest', 'moments', 'see', 'Kagemusha', 'Dersu', 'Uzala']",N/A

25502,A2GVFB8PHXGP2H,0780021185,Joseph Barbarie,"[1, 3]","It is no surprise, perhaps, that Kurosawa can move so effortlessly, so fluently, from genre to genre.  There, are of course, his feudal warrior pictures (even there, I detect sub-divisions within that specific genre; that is, ""Ran"" is nothing like ""The Hidden Fortress""), or his novelistic adaptations (""Hakuchi""), his speculative drama (""Dreams"", ""Kagemusha"").  But this, a noir-esque policier is all the more surprising for the amount of life the master is able to breathe into an otherwise stale, and over-worked type.  By the time Kurosawa made this film -- the 60s -- American specialists in the detective-piece, like Wilder, Curtiz, et al., were either dead, or out to pasture.  Hitchcock, though still active in the 60s and 70s, was by now in decline, as well -- his later works, with the possible exception of ""The Birds"" -- had become overly mannered.As is usual with Kurosawa, there is ultimate, magisterial control of every image.  From the almost tableaux-like blocking of the opening scenes in Mr. Gondo's house, to the swirling vortex of a seedy juke joint, nothing is left to chance.  Kurosawa's camera -- particularly in the harrowing junkie den sequence -- takes an almost anthropological interest in its subjects.  There is also the single dash of color (I hesitate to say more, insofar as it is a major plot point), which is almost like an exclamation point in the otherwise razor-sharp black-and-white.Ultimately, however, it is Kurosawa's human touch that makes this superior.  His interest is never in a beautiful image for its own sake (as with, say, Kubrick) but rather in his characters.  The psychological portraiture takes on Dostoyevskian depth in regard to the antagonist.  The movie's central shock is how banal of a person the villain turns out to be, and how trivial and unintelligible his motives are.  He has all of the feigned depth of the high-school outcast who decides to shoot up his classmates.  This characterization is accomplished, of course, in the typically gentle Kurosawa way.  For that reason, some viewers may find him more of an absorbing character than Kurosawa ultimately intends him to be.  The most revealing characterization of Takeuchi is to be found in the mirror-like lenses of his glasses; they reveal nothing but their surroundings.  That is, he is ultimately a bit empty -- we look for something of him in them, but encounter only our own reflection.",3,Dostoyevskian,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,2411,"['surprise', 'perhaps', 'Kurosawa', 'can', 'move', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'so', 'fluently', 'genre', 'genre', 'are', 'course', 'feudal', 'warrior', 'pictures', 'even', 'there', 'detect', 'sub-divisions', 'specific', 'genre', 'Ran', 'nothing', 'Hidden', 'Fortress', 'novelistic', 'adaptations', 'Hakuchi', 'speculative', 'drama', 'Dreams', 'Kagemusha', 'noir-esque', 'policier', 'more', 'surprising', 'amount', 'life', 'master', 'able', 'breathe', 'otherwise', 'stale', 'over-worked', 'type', 'time', 'Kurosawa', 'made', 'film', '60s', 'American', 'specialists', 'detective-piece', 'Wilder', 'Curtiz', 'et', 'al.', 'were', 'either', 'dead', 'pasture', 'Hitchcock', 'still', 'active', '60s', '70s', 'was', 'now', 'decline', 'as', 'well', 'later', 'works', 'possible', 'exception', 'Birds', 'had', 'become', 'overly', 'mannered.As', 'usual', 'Kurosawa', 'ultimate', 'magisterial', 'control', 'image', 'almost', 'tableaux-like', 'blocking', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Mr.', 'Gondo', 'house', 'swirling', 'vortex', 'seedy', 'juke', 'joint', 'nothing', 'left', 'chance', 'Kurosawa', 'camera', 'particularly', 'harrowing', 'junkie', 'den', 'sequence', 'almost', 'anthropological', 'interest', 'subjects', 'also', 'single', 'dash', 'color', 'hesitate', 'say', 'more', 'insofar', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'almost', 'exclamation', 'point', 'otherwise', 'razor-sharp', 'black-and-white.Ultimately', 'however', 'Kurosawa', 'human', 'touch', 'superior', 'interest', 'never', 'beautiful', 'image', 'own', 'sake', 'say', 'Kubrick', 'rather', 'characters', 'psychological', 'portraiture', 'Dostoyevskian', 'depth', 'regard', 'antagonist', 'movie', 'central', 'shock', 'how', 'banal', 'person', 'villain', 'out', 'be', 'how', 'trivial', 'unintelligible', 'motives', 'are', 'feigned', 'depth', 'high-school', 'outcast', 'who', 'shoot', 'up', 'classmates', 'characterization', 'accomplished', 'course', 'typically', 'gentle', 'Kurosawa', 'way', 'reason', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'more', 'absorbing', 'character', 'Kurosawa', 'ultimately', 'be', 'most', 'revealing', 'characterization', 'Takeuchi', 'be', 'found', 'mirror-like', 'lenses', 'glasses', 'reveal', 'nothing', 'surroundings', 'ultimately', 'bit', 'empty', 'look', 'something', 'encounter', 'only', 'own', 'reflection']",N/A

A kidnapper demands a hefty ransom before returning a businessman's child.  Along the way, there are twists and turns pushing investigators to the limit.  This movie is somewhat unique in that it is really one tale broken into two halves.  The first part deals with the personal turmoil facing the protagonist, Kingo Gondo.  Afterwards, the herculean efforts of the police to find the kidnapper take center stage.  Perhaps what makes this picture so effective is the hour the audience spends getting to know Gondo.  This investment of time pays huge dividends as the viewer cannot help but root for the police as they dutifully follow their leads.  Without a doubt, this crime drama is more than just a `what would you do' exercise.  In reality, it is an honest depiction of how one man's selfishness caused a tidal wave of calamity.

I have only seen about a dozen of them, but they are all masterpieces. High and Low is an English translation of Tengoku to jigoku, which is more literally translated ""Heaven and Hell"".I've seen other reviews (some giving away too many spoilers, IMHO) mentioning the adaptation from ""King's Ransom"", an 87th Precinct police procedural by Evan Hunter - written under pseudonym Ed McBain. I've also seen others mention a little of the structure of the movie - essentially two acts first set in the home of Kingo Gondo (played by perhaps the greatest of Japanese actors Toshiro Mifune)and the second act a police procedural aimed at tracking down a kidnapper. I want to point out to the gentle reader that Kurosawa's structure is much more complex than that. The master director forces a change in point of view almost every fifteen minutes. In the opening moments we are introduced to Mr. Gondo, who is a shoe executive and has built his company up to a thing of pride and wealth. But Gondo is opposed by other executives at his company who point out that more money can be made if they don't work so hard at making QUALITY shoes. Gondo won't hear of it and with a little premature hubris informs the other executives that he is about to buy a majority of the company's shares and he will run the business as he always has, with an emphasis on producing good shoes.During this portion of the film I gained more than a little respect for Gondo, who wants to be known more for the quality of his work than for wealth.Immediately after this scene Gondo receives a phone call informing him that his son has been kidnapped and is being ransomed. The ransom will use up all the money he has put aside to buy the shares in his company. If he does not follow through and buy the majority share in his company, you know that the other vindictive executives will kick him to the curb. Complicating things even further - we find that the kidnapper mistakenly did not take Gondo's son, but instead took the son of Gondo's chauffeur. Now Gondo is faced with a triple heart-breaking decision. As a man of honor he wants to help the chauffeur's family. But if he does, he will be financially ruined.The center transitioning portion of the film deals with the complicated method used to trade the 30 million yen in cash for the boy, and I won't say here whether the boy is returned dead or alive or whether or not the kidnapper receives the money, but this part is as exciting as any modern thriller.The final part of the film is a taut, smart police procedural and we see the methodical steps used to track down the kidnapper, with many lovely human details such as the chauffeur going back to the scene of the crime in an attempt to play amateur detective and regain HIS honor (since Gondo gave away his fortune to ransom the chauffeur's son).Along the way we see smart detectives, desperate heroin addicts, and real and caring humans. Perhaps no other film director saw people for what we are better than Kurosawa.In Japanese with subtitles, so if you don't like to read or don't understand Japanese, keep on walking.",5,Kurosawa - Master of Every Film Genre,1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,3200,"['Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'created', 'canon', 'films', 'continue', 'influence', 'movie-makers', 'world', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'dozen', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'High', 'Low', 'English', 'translation', 'Tengoku', 'jigoku', 'more', 'literally', 'translated', 'Heaven', 'Hell', '.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'reviews', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'IMHO', 'mentioning', 'adaptation', 'King', 'Ransom', '87th', 'Precinct', 'police', 'procedural', 'Evan', 'Hunter', 'written', 'pseudonym', 'Ed', 'McBain', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'others', 'mention', 'little', 'structure', 'movie', 'essentially', 'two', 'acts', 'first', 'set', 'home', 'Kingo', 'Gondo', 'played', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'second', 'act', 'police', 'procedural', 'aimed', 'tracking', 'down', 'kidnapper', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'gentle', 'reader', 'Kurosawa', 'structure', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'master', 'director', 'change', 'point', 'view', 'almost', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'opening', 'moments', 'are', 'introduced', 'Mr.', 'Gondo', 'who', 'shoe', 'executive', 'built', 'company', 'up', 'thing', 'pride', 'wealth', 'Gondo', 'opposed', 'other', 'executives', 'company', 'who', 'point', 'out', 'more', 'money', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'making', 'QUALITY', 'shoes', 'Gondo', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'little', 'premature', 'hubris', 'informs', 'other', 'executives', 'buy', 'majority', 'company', 'shares', 'will', 'run', 'business', 'always', 'emphasis', 'producing', 'good', 'shoes.During', 'portion', 'film', 'gained', 'more', 'little', 'respect', 'Gondo', 'who', 'be', 'known', 'more', 'quality', 'work', 'wealth.Immediately', 'scene', 'Gondo', 'phone', 'call', 'informing', 'son', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'being', 'ransomed', 'ransom', 'will', 'use', 'up', 'money', 'put', 'aside', 'buy', 'shares', 'company', 'not', 'follow', 'buy', 'majority', 'share', 'company', 'know', 'other', 'vindictive', 'executives', 'will', 'kick', 'curb', 'Complicating', 'things', 'even', 'further', 'find', 'kidnapper', 'mistakenly', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'Gondo', 'son', 'instead', 'took', 'son', 'Gondo', 'chauffeur', 'Now', 'Gondo', 'faced', 'triple', 'heart-breaking', 'decision', 'man', 'honor', 'help', 'chauffeur', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'financially', 'ruined.The', 'center', 'transitioning', 'portion', 'film', 'deals', 'complicated', 'method', 'used', 'trade', '30', 'million', 'yen', 'cash', 'boy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'here', 'boy', 'returned', 'dead', 'alive', 'not', 'kidnapper', 'money', 'part', 'as', 'exciting', 'modern', 'thriller.The', 'final', 'part', 'film', 'taut', 'smart', 'police', 'procedural', 'see', 'methodical', 'steps', 'used', 'track', 'down', 'kidnapper', 'many', 'lovely', 'human', 'details', 'such', 'chauffeur', 'going', 'back', 'scene', 'crime', 'attempt', 'play', 'amateur', 'detective', 'regain', 'HIS', 'honor', 'Gondo', 'gave', 'away', 'fortune', 'ransom', 'chauffeur', 'son', 'way', 'see', 'smart', 'detectives', 'desperate', 'heroin', 'addicts', 'real', 'caring', 'humans', 'Perhaps', 'other', 'film', 'director', 'saw', 'people', 'what', 'are', 'better', 'Kurosawa.In', 'Japanese', 'subtitles', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Japanese', 'keep', 'walking']",N/A

25511,AL4MKKO24563R,0780021185,Michael K. Beusch,"[47, 53]","BEWARE: SPOILER ALERTVery rarely does a film improve upon the book on which it is based. It takes a visual master, working with an excellent screenwriter, to convey as much detail about a story as an author. However, Akira Kurosawa's High and Low manages to do it. The source novel, Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novel King's Ransom is a well written thriller that, nonetheless, doesn't really stay with the reader afterwards. Kurosawa, however, better known for his samurai epics, took McBain's story and gave it a depth never realized in the book. The famed director stays faithful to the novel, but fleshes out a simple detective story into a drama that makes social commentary as well as entertains.McBain's Douglas King never really earns the reader's sympathy -- even though we can understand his motives. Toshiro Mifune's Kingo Gondo, in contrast, becomes a three-dimensional sympathetic character. Both men have their entire financial well-being at stake in the form of a hostile takeover bid for control of a shoe company. Both men, at first, behave selfishly, refusing to pay the ransom even though they are risking their chauffeur's son's life. However, McBain's Douglas King never shows the humanity that Mifune's Gondo does. Kurosawa adds a scene, not in the book, where Gondo pays the ransom and saves the kidnapped child. Even though his business deal is now dead and he is broke, he still reacts with relief and joy when the kidnappers return the chauffeur's son. It's an emotional payoff that McBain's book is sorely lacking and helps to flesh out the character.Gondo is also a more sympathetic character partially due to the fact that his actions are at least partially dictated by Japan's rigid caste system. Japanese society is broken up into social strata whereby the rich and powerful expect the lower classes to know their place. This division of influence, unlike in the United States, is generally accepted, even by those on the lower end of the scale. This isn't just the way Mifune's Gondo thinks -- EVERYONE thinks that way in Japan. However, Kurosawa, while he understands the mindset of Japanese society, is also critical of it. Kurosawa shows that when Gondo pays the ransom and saves the boy, even at the cost of his financial well-being, the Japanese people, as a whole, hail Gondo as a hero. Our sympathies are clearly supposed to be with the chauffeur and his son, even though it goes against every principle of the Japanese caste system. This commentary gives High and Low a depth that McBain's novel lacked.In the novel, McBain hedges his bets morally. One of the kidnappers is a vile hardened criminal. However, the other two kidnappers, a husband and wife, are more sympathetic, particularly the wife who doesn't know about the plan until it is already in effect. In the end, the kidnappers get away and the chauffeur's son, Bobby, refuses to aid police in their capture. In addition, the police are seen as somewhat disjointed with some detectives with personalities and egos that irritate other policemen.Kurosawa, in contrast, concentrates on one central kidnapper, a vile person who exploits drug addicts to do his dirty work and then kills them when he gets what he wants. McBain's subplot about the husband and wife is distracting, even though his kidnappers, with their self-doubt and streaks of conscience, seem to be a more balanced and realistic portrayal. In addition, the police are seen as a cohesive unit who forgo ego in order to catch the kidnapper. However, this is more a reflection of Japanese society, with its emphasis on team effort rather than individual glory, than a pie-in-the-sky idealized vision of the police. McBain's portrayal of the police is probably close to what an American police squad is like. Still, Kurosawa's vision is more satisfying. The police pursue the criminal and bring him to justice. Ironically, the resolution of the film, made in Japan, is probably much more satisfying to Americans than the resolution of the book, written by an American.King's Ransom has an interesting plot. But author Ed McBain has only provided a good skeleton of a story. Akira Kurosawa, in contrast, has taken the exciting, but conventional story and turned it into a memorable cinematic masterpiece.",5,MUCH better than the source novel,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,4261,"['BEWARE', 'SPOILER', 'ALERTVery', 'rarely', 'film', 'improve', 'book', 'based', 'visual', 'master', 'working', 'excellent', 'screenwriter', 'convey', 'as', 'much', 'detail', 'story', 'author', 'However', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'High', 'Low', 'manages', 'do', 'source', 'novel', 'Ed', 'McBain', '87th', 'Precinct', 'novel', 'King', 'Ransom', 'well', 'written', 'thriller', 'nonetheless', ""n't"", 'really', 'stay', 'reader', 'afterwards', 'Kurosawa', 'however', 'better', 'known', 'samurai', 'epics', 'took', 'McBain', 'story', 'gave', 'depth', 'never', 'realized', 'book', 'famed', 'director', 'faithful', 'novel', 'out', 'simple', 'detective', 'story', 'drama', 'social', 'commentary', 'as', 'well', 'entertains.McBain', 'Douglas', 'King', 'never', 'really', 'reader', 'sympathy', 'even', 'can', 'understand', 'motives', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'Kingo', 'Gondo', 'contrast', 'three-dimensional', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'men', 'have', 'entire', 'financial', 'well-being', 'stake', 'form', 'hostile', 'takeover', 'bid', 'control', 'shoe', 'company', 'men', 'first', 'behave', 'selfishly', 'refusing', 'pay', 'ransom', 'even', 'are', 'risking', 'chauffeur', 'son', 'life', 'However', 'McBain', 'Douglas', 'King', 'never', 'humanity', 'Mifune', 'Gondo', 'Kurosawa', 'scene', 'not', 'book', 'where', 'Gondo', 'ransom', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'Even', 'business', 'deal', 'now', 'dead', 'broke', 'still', 'relief', 'joy', 'when', 'kidnappers', 'return', 'chauffeur', 'son', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'McBain', 'book', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'flesh', 'out', 'character.Gondo', 'also', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'partially', 'due', 'fact', 'actions', 'are', 'least', 'partially', 'dictated', 'Japan', 'rigid', 'caste', 'system', 'Japanese', 'society', 'broken', 'up', 'social', 'strata', 'whereby', 'rich', 'powerful', 'expect', 'lower', 'classes', 'know', 'place', 'division', 'influence', 'United', 'States', 'generally', 'accepted', 'even', 'lower', 'end', 'scale', ""n't"", 'just', 'way', 'Mifune', 'Gondo', 'EVERYONE', 'way', 'Japan', 'However', 'Kurosawa', 'mindset', 'Japanese', 'society', 'also', 'critical', 'Kurosawa', 'when', 'Gondo', 'ransom', 'boy', 'even', 'cost', 'financial', 'well-being', 'Japanese', 'people', 'whole', 'hail', 'Gondo', 'hero', 'sympathies', 'are', 'clearly', 'supposed', 'be', 'chauffeur', 'son', 'even', 'principle', 'Japanese', 'caste', 'system', 'commentary', 'High', 'Low', 'depth', 'McBain', 'novel', 'novel', 'McBain', 'bets', 'morally', 'One', 'kidnappers', 'vile', 'hardened', 'criminal', 'However', 'other', 'two', 'kidnappers', 'husband', 'wife', 'are', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'particularly', 'wife', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'plan', 'already', 'effect', 'end', 'kidnappers', 'get', 'away', 'chauffeur', 'son', 'Bobby', 'aid', 'police', 'capture', 'addition', 'police', 'are', 'seen', 'somewhat', 'disjointed', 'detectives', 'personalities', 'egos', 'irritate', 'other', 'policemen.Kurosawa', 'contrast', 'one', 'central', 'kidnapper', 'vile', 'person', 'who', 'drug', 'addicts', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'then', 'kills', 'when', 'what', 'McBain', 'subplot', 'husband', 'wife', 'distracting', 'even', 'kidnappers', 'self-doubt', 'streaks', 'conscience', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'balanced', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'addition', 'police', 'are', 'seen', 'cohesive', 'unit', 'who', 'forgo', 'ego', 'order', 'catch', 'kidnapper', 'However', 'more', 'reflection', 'Japanese', 'society', 'emphasis', 'team', 'effort', 'rather', 'individual', 'glory', 'pie-in-the-sky', 'idealized', 'vision', 'police', 'McBain', 'portrayal', 'police', 'probably', 'close', 'what', 'American', 'police', 'squad', 'Still', 'Kurosawa', 'vision', 'more', 'satisfying', 'police', 'pursue', 'criminal', 'bring', 'justice', 'Ironically', 'resolution', 'film', 'made', 'Japan', 'probably', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Americans', 'resolution', 'book', 'written', 'American.King', 'Ransom', 'interesting', 'plot', 'author', 'Ed', 'McBain', 'only', 'provided', 'good', 'skeleton', 'story', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'contrast', 'taken', 'exciting', 'conventional', 'story', 'turned', 'memorable', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece']",N/A
25512,AKCF45Z2DV6TN,0780021185,"Michael Weber ""fairportfan""","[2, 3]","Kurosawa seems to have been interested, if not fascinated, by American mystery/detective fiction.  This film is officially adapted from Ed mcBain's &quot;King's Ransome&quot;, and &quot;Yojimbo&quot; is an uncredited but admitted adaptation of Hammett's &quot;Red Harvest&quot;.&quot;King's Ransome&quot; is a natural for adaptation to a Japanese setting, as it revolves around questions as to what is proper and what is owed; what is owed to the master by the servant and what is owed by the master to the servant, and, beyond that, and possibly more importantly, as it dictates how one will act on such interactions, what is owed to one's own honour and self-respect.By naming his character &quot;Kingo&quot;, Kurosawa both follows the original (McBain's character's name, to accord with the title pun, is &quot;King&quot;), and emphasises the almost feudal questions of honour involved in the story.Other reviews have summarised the plot -- i'll just touch on a few points:King/Kingo is CEO of an established family-run shoe manufacturing company; in response to falling products, somef his Board want to import shoddy shoes and put the company's respected name on them, in order to make a quick profit.  He sees this as wrong, both in that it is not fair to the customers who rely on their brand-name to mean a quality shoe, and because, in the long run, it will damage the honour (and commercial viability) of that name.One element of the essential conflict: What does the company owe its loyal customers?  And can the company tolerate the loss of &quot;face&quot; inherent in such a bait-and-switch scheme?And then the ransome note arrives -- pay, or his twelve-year-old son dies.  If he pays the ransome, he will lose the fight on the Board of Directors, and his company name will be damaged; but there's no choice -- this is his only son, more important to him than anything else in the world.  But, *because* of the fight with the Directors, he already has the money needed for the ransome on hand; of course he will pay.Another element: Blood is more important than money.And then McBain and Kurosawa's twist -- the son is fine; it is his long-time playmate and age-mate, the chauffeur's son, who has been kidnapped.The chauffeur is a long-time employee and friend.  His son and Kingo's son are devoted playmates.  The chauffeur is a widower and his son is his only family.He has given Kingo his loyalty for many years.  And now he is suffering for his proximity to the great man -- if not for that loyal service and his son's closeness to Kingo's son, his son would not be in danger.The final element: How much does Kingo owe this good man -- and in what manner; as employer?  As friend?  As (however unintentionally and passively) the cause of his trouble?If he pays the debt he acknowledges that he owes his chauffeur and ransomes his son, than he will lose his shoe company; his name will be publically dishonoured by the shoddy prodcut that the company will market if he loses.But, if he saves his company, he will save his name's honour in that regard, and will publically not lose &quot;face&quot;... but he, and the chauffeur and his own son will know that he sacrificed an innocent whom he could have saved.Kingo is not an evil man nor a hard man; he must choose, and he must make the correct choice aganst a constantly-shortening time limit.An excellent adaptation of a classic police procedural novel, and a cogent and pointed essay on honour and responsibility, subjects common in Kurosawa's work.((For another of his films dealing with similar questions of honour and loyalty, try &quot;Kagemusha&quot;.))",4,More Cross-Cultural Influences.,1004572800,"11 1, 2001",2001,3628,"['Kurosawa', 'have', 'been', 'interested', 'not', 'fascinated', 'American', 'mystery/detective', 'fiction', 'film', 'officially', 'adapted', 'Ed', 'mcBain', 'quot', 'King', 'Ransome', 'quot', 'quot', 'Yojimbo', 'quot', 'uncredited', 'admitted', 'adaptation', 'Hammett', 'quot', 'Red', 'Harvest', 'quot', 'quot', 'King', 'Ransome', 'quot', 'natural', 'adaptation', 'Japanese', 'setting', 'around', 'questions', 'what', 'proper', 'what', 'owed', 'what', 'owed', 'master', 'servant', 'what', 'owed', 'master', 'servant', 'possibly', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'one', 'will', 'act', 'such', 'interactions', 'what', 'owed', 'one', 'own', 'honour', 'self-respect.By', 'naming', 'character', 'quot', 'Kingo', 'quot', 'Kurosawa', 'original', 'McBain', 'character', 'name', 'accord', 'title', 'pun', 'quot', 'King', 'quot', 'almost', 'feudal', 'questions', 'honour', 'involved', 'story.Other', 'reviews', 'have', 'summarised', 'plot', 'i', ""'ll"", 'just', 'touch', 'few', 'points', 'King/Kingo', 'CEO', 'established', 'family-run', 'shoe', 'manufacturing', 'company', 'response', 'falling', 'products', 'somef', 'Board', 'want', 'import', 'shoddy', 'shoes', 'put', 'company', 'respected', 'name', 'order', 'make', 'quick', 'profit', 'wrong', 'not', 'fair', 'customers', 'who', 'rely', 'brand-name', 'mean', 'quality', 'shoe', 'because', 'long', 'run', 'will', 'damage', 'honour', 'commercial', 'viability', 'name.One', 'element', 'essential', 'conflict', 'What', 'company', 'loyal', 'customers', 'can', 'company', 'tolerate', 'loss', 'quot', 'face', 'quot', 'inherent', 'such', 'bait-and-switch', 'scheme', 'then', 'ransome', 'note', 'arrives', 'pay', 'twelve-year-old', 'son', 'dies', 'ransome', 'will', 'lose', 'fight', 'Board', 'Directors', 'company', 'name', 'will', 'be', 'damaged', 'choice', 'only', 'son', 'more', 'important', 'anything', 'else', 'world', '*because*', 'fight', 'Directors', 'already', 'money', 'needed', 'ransome', 'hand', 'course', 'will', 'pay.Another', 'element', 'Blood', 'more', 'important', 'money.And', 'then', 'McBain', 'Kurosawa', 'twist', 'son', 'fine', 'long-time', 'playmate', 'age-mate', 'chauffeur', 'son', 'who', 'been', 'kidnapped.The', 'chauffeur', 'long-time', 'employee', 'friend', 'son', 'Kingo', 'son', 'are', 'devoted', 'playmates', 'chauffeur', 'widower', 'son', 'only', 'family.He', 'given', 'Kingo', 'loyalty', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'suffering', 'proximity', 'great', 'man', 'not', 'loyal', 'service', 'son', 'closeness', 'Kingo', 'son', 'son', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'danger.The', 'final', 'element', 'How', 'much', 'Kingo', 'owe', 'good', 'man', 'what', 'manner', 'employer', 'friend', 'however', 'unintentionally', 'passively', 'cause', 'trouble', 'debt', 'chauffeur', 'ransomes', 'son', 'will', 'lose', 'shoe', 'company', 'name', 'will', 'be', 'publically', 'dishonoured', 'shoddy', 'prodcut', 'company', 'will', 'market', 'company', 'will', 'save', 'name', 'honour', 'regard', 'will', 'publically', 'not', 'lose', 'quot', 'face', 'quot', 'chauffeur', 'own', 'son', 'will', 'know', 'sacrificed', 'innocent', 'whom', 'could', 'have', 'saved.Kingo', 'not', 'evil', 'man', 'hard', 'man', 'must', 'choose', 'must', 'make', 'correct', 'choice', 'aganst', 'constantly-shortening', 'time', 'limit.An', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'police', 'procedural', 'novel', 'cogent', 'pointed', 'essay', 'honour', 'responsibility', 'common', 'Kurosawa', 'work', 'films', 'dealing', 'similar', 'questions', 'honour', 'loyalty', 'try', 'quot', 'Kagemusha', 'quot']",N/A

Even having read the premise and plot and character sketches of this movie had not prepared me for the film itself. Kurosawa is a genius, not because of his broad range of works and themes but, because of his masterful subtle control of elements within the single movie. The theme is none other than an obvious contrast (although the original Japanese translation of the title can be rendered ""Heaven and Hell"") and here we have a movie of conflicting opposites as existing only in a modern industrilize society. And the movie itself is broke into two contrasts: first, the money-comfort view of upper-class workaholic dedicated businessman Mufine in an expansive home overlooking the town, people, and indusrty below and, second, the view of a degenerate crimminal element weaving its way through a city of many sub-levels (similar to the effect made in the anime masterwork ""Metropolis"") where one level, working class, then police quarters, and finally dope alley lead us further into the enormous chasm of rich and poor, fortunate and unfortunate, high and low, heaven and hell. This multi-level construction gives the movie a complexity that only a few movies have even come close to touch. Be sure to watch for the countless composition shots in the first half of the film (almost no two are alike). In addition the contrasts and similes between characters themselves add to the plot giving us the effect much like the enormous city map blow-up down at police headquarters. Everything and everyone intersects at one point and the implications of this is much like watching lives unfold in a documentary that can be compared to some of the best moments in other theater and film (from ""Death of a Salesman"" to Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"").

He will not let himself be bought out by the new generation of businessmen who are in it just to make money. Gondo makes it very clear that the shoes they are making are junk and are not delicately handled like they should be.  Gondo is against these businessmen and refuses to work with them.Gondo wants to break free and work on his own branch out of the shoe company.

However, he finds out that the kidnapper has taken the wrong child; the child is actually the son of a close friend who was with Gondo and his wife at the time.  Gondo is now in a dilemma.What follows is the police investigation as we meet the chief inspector (Nakadai, a Kurosawa regular) and the other investigators.  Kurosawa makes this film a deep interesting character study right from the start, as we begin to understand the kind of person Gondo is.  Gondo's dilemma is vividly shown and Mifune does a great job helping us understand his plight along with Kurosawa's great script.The second half is mainly police investigation but is so fascinating and compellling in the style by which Kurosawa strucutres it.  He uses flashbacks, wipe dissolves, lighting, closeups, and music all to his advantage.  Kurosawa once again proves that he as great an artist as he is a storyteller, and maybe, the finest storyteller in film.  The film's detailed locations are well balanced, from Gondo's peaceful and wealthy mansion perched up on a hill, to the hot and humid investigation room, to the streets of Tokyo, and to the crack houses in the urban slums. Kurosawa makes use of all the actors effectively, particularly Mifune and Nakadai.  The film is a journey through crime, tension, reality, and Kurosawa leads us every step of the way to a powerful climax.",5,High and Low,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,2272,"['High', 'Low', 'Kurosawa', '1963', 'crime', 'film', 'peaceful', 'mansion', 'Gondo', 'Mifune', 'who', 'involved', 'shoe', 'production', 'Kurosawa', 'immediately', 'character', 'showing', 'how', 'passion', 'work', 'how', 'work', 'part', 'life', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'be', 'bought', 'out', 'new', 'generation', 'businessmen', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'make', 'money', 'Gondo', 'very', 'clear', 'shoes', 'are', 'making', 'are', 'junk', 'are', 'not', 'delicately', 'handled', 'should', 'be', 'Gondo', 'businessmen', 'refuses', 'work', 'them.Gondo', 'break', 'free', 'work', 'own', 'branch', 'shoe', 'company', 'family', 'assistant', 'Kawanishi', 'ready', 'do', 'so', '30', 'million', 'yen', 'money', 'been', 'saving', 'up', 'years', 'Things', 'change', 'however', 'when', 'phone', 'call', 'son', 'been', 'captured', 'Gondo', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'get', 'son', 'back', 'However', 'out', 'kidnapper', 'taken', 'wrong', 'child', 'child', 'actually', 'son', 'close', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'Gondo', 'wife', 'time', 'Gondo', 'now', 'dilemma.What', 'police', 'investigation', 'meet', 'chief', 'inspector', 'Nakadai', 'Kurosawa', 'regular', 'other', 'investigators', 'Kurosawa', 'film', 'deep', 'interesting', 'character', 'study', 'right', 'start', 'begin', 'understand', 'kind', 'person', 'Gondo', 'Gondo', 'dilemma', 'vividly', 'shown', 'Mifune', 'great', 'job', 'helping', 'understand', 'plight', 'Kurosawa', 'great', 'script.The', 'second', 'half', 'mainly', 'police', 'investigation', 'so', 'fascinating', 'compellling', 'style', 'Kurosawa', 'flashbacks', 'wipe', 'dissolves', 'lighting', 'closeups', 'music', 'advantage', 'Kurosawa', 'once', 'again', 'as', 'great', 'artist', 'storyteller', 'maybe', 'finest', 'storyteller', 'film', 'film', 'detailed', 'locations', 'are', 'well', 'balanced', 'Gondo', 'peaceful', 'wealthy', 'mansion', 'perched', 'up', 'hill', 'hot', 'humid', 'investigation', 'room', 'streets', 'Tokyo', 'crack', 'houses', 'urban', 'slums', 'Kurosawa', 'use', 'actors', 'effectively', 'particularly', 'Mifune', 'Nakadai', 'film', 'journey', 'crime', 'tension', 'reality', 'Kurosawa', 'step', 'way', 'powerful', 'climax']",N/A

Intrigued?...me neither.I watched this movie expecting a mediocre showing from my favorite director, but what I got was a wonderfully done film with a lot to say.Toshiro Mifune plays Kingo Gondo, a successful shoe tycoon with dated ideas.  He believes that shoes are important because they support the entire weight of the body, while his partners just want to produce cheap stylish shoes that women will buy over and over.  His partners want to vote him out of power, so Gondo comes up with a plan to buy enough of the company so he can sway the vote.  Things go wrong when a man calls and says he has kiddnapped Gondo's son and he'll need to pay an amount of money, nearly equal to what he needs to keep himself in the company, he cooperates right away, but he finds out that the kiddnapper made a mistake and has kiddnapped his driver's son instead.what follows is a interesting look into the process of catching a criminal and a study on the social structure of japan (one of Kurosawa's favorite subjects).  What makes this movie stand out is the fact that it is not exagerated, the process of solving the crime seems long and drawn out, yet it still manages to hold your attention.  Another interesting detail is the fact that Mifune owns a shoe company, in most kidnapping movies, the target is some rich AND famous person.  Gondo, while rich, is certainly not famous, he is basically a glorified shoe salesmen, which makes the story that much more realistic.Along with the kidnapping, the movie also focuses on the differences in classes.  Gondo lives high on a lofty hill, while the kidnapper lives down with everybody else in the sweltering heat, hence the title high and low (or heaven and hell).I'd recommend this movie to anyone who like crime dramas or japanese cinema.",5,Another Fine Movie From Akira Kurosawa,1051920000,"05 3, 2003",2003,1857,"['wealthy', 'shoe', 'tycoon', 'plans', 'take', 'over', 'company', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'Intrigued', 'neither.I', 'watched', 'movie', 'expecting', 'mediocre', 'showing', 'favorite', 'director', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'film', 'lot', 'say.Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'plays', 'Kingo', 'Gondo', 'successful', 'shoe', 'tycoon', 'dated', 'ideas', 'shoes', 'are', 'important', 'support', 'entire', 'weight', 'body', 'partners', 'just', 'want', 'produce', 'cheap', 'stylish', 'shoes', 'women', 'will', 'buy', 'partners', 'want', 'vote', 'power', 'so', 'Gondo', 'up', 'plan', 'buy', 'enough', 'company', 'so', 'can', 'sway', 'vote', 'Things', 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'man', 'kiddnapped', 'Gondo', 'son', ""'ll"", 'need', 'pay', 'amount', 'money', 'nearly', 'equal', 'what', 'keep', 'company', 'right', 'away', 'out', 'kiddnapper', 'made', 'mistake', 'kiddnapped', 'driver', 'son', 'instead.what', 'interesting', 'look', 'process', 'catching', 'criminal', 'study', 'social', 'structure', 'japan', 'one', 'Kurosawa', 'favorite', 'subjects', 'What', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'fact', 'not', 'exagerated', 'process', 'solving', 'crime', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'yet', 'still', 'hold', 'attention', 'interesting', 'detail', 'fact', 'Mifune', 'shoe', 'company', 'most', 'kidnapping', 'movies', 'target', 'rich', 'AND', 'famous', 'person', 'Gondo', 'rich', 'certainly', 'not', 'famous', 'basically', 'glorified', 'shoe', 'salesmen', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'realistic.Along', 'kidnapping', 'movie', 'also', 'differences', 'classes', 'Gondo', 'high', 'lofty', 'hill', 'kidnapper', 'down', 'everybody', 'else', 'sweltering', 'heat', 'hence', 'title', 'high', 'low', 'heaven', 'hell', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'crime', 'dramas', 'japanese', 'cinema']",N/A

Based on Ed McBain's novel, KING'S RANSOM, this is the story of the kidnapping of a little boy and the eventual citywide manhunt for the mysterious criminal behind it. It is the story of the appropriately named Kingo Gondo (translation: ""Big King""), the richest man in town, and the devastating effect the crime has on him and his family. Moreover, it is both a sharp-eyed portrait of Japan circa 1962 and a timeless study of human nature.In stark, gorgeously photographed black-and-white, Kurosawa uses the then-new widescreen process better than just about anyone, and he gets memorable performances from his cast, notably the great Toshiro Mifune as Kingo and Kyoko Kagawa as his wife, Reiko. The couple's gradual deterioration in their huge house on the hill overlooking the city brings an almost Shakespearean quality to the story. The haunting sense of tragedy behind the events elevates HIGH AND LOW above most other cops-and-robbers movies. As for the suspense--well, Hitchcock couldn't have done it better.

A seemingly decent  businessman is exposed in his decency by the kidnapping of the son of his  chauffeur.  The underworld of modern Japan is rather patronizingly  portrayed - with its American GIs and drug sub-culture.  Kurosawa wasn't  very adept at understanding the changes in modern Japanese society.  Yet  the confrontation of the Mifune character with the kidnapper in the last  scene is quite harrowing - the oppressed at last confronting their  oppressors.  To his credit, Kurosawa doesn't avert his eyes for one moment.",5,Irresistible,965952000,"08 11, 2000",2000,785,"['Kurosawa', 'took', 'pulp', 'story', 'made', 'modern', 'existentialist', 'masterpiece', 'Tengoku', 'Jigoku', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'much', 'less', 'mannered', 'Bad', 'Sleep', 'Well', 'closer', 'tradition', 'Kurosawa', 'established', 'fourteen', 'years', 'earlier', 'Stray', 'Dog', 'A', 'seemingly', 'decent', 'businessman', 'exposed', 'decency', 'kidnapping', 'son', 'chauffeur', 'underworld', 'modern', 'Japan', 'rather', 'patronizingly', 'portrayed', 'American', 'GIs', 'drug', 'sub-culture', 'Kurosawa', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'adept', 'understanding', 'changes', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'society', 'confrontation', 'Mifune', 'character', 'kidnapper', 'last', 'scene', 'quite', 'harrowing', 'oppressed', 'last', 'confronting', 'oppressors', 'credit', 'Kurosawa', ""n't"", 'avert', 'eyes', 'one', 'moment']",N/A
25530,A1NNWB4LHZV6XV,0780021185,Wave Tossed,"[4, 4]","This film starts out with Gondo Kingo, a wealthy, self-made man who has risen from a humble shoe maker inside the National Shoe factory to an executive and minority owner of National Shoe (yes, that is the name, it's the English name, ""National Shoe""). Having been a craftsman, Gondo wants to make sure that National Shoe will continue to make quality, well-made shoes. His fellow executives want to save money by switching to cheaply-made products that will fall apart soon. Gondo has engineered a plan to take over the company to maintain the shoe-crafting quality. To implement his plan, Gondo has mortgaged his entire fortune, including his large house that sits on top of a hill (the ""High"" in the title).Right in the middle of all this, Takeuchi Ginjiro, a very angry medical intern, has engineered his own plan. He plans to kidnap Gondo's young son, Jun, and demand a huge ransom. Two of his drug-addicted coherts perform the kidnapping and Takeuchi makes the call to Gondo. The amount demanded is such that it would completely ruin Gondo if he were to pay it. He would even lose his large house, and would most likely lose his job and income. Gondo is willing to do this for his own son. However, it turns out that the kidnappers have made a mistake. They have kidnapped Shinichi, the son of Gondo's chauffeur, who is a widower of very modest means. The moral dilemma poses itself: will Gondo sacrifice his entire fortune to save the son of his chauffeur?I don't want to ""spoil"" the film for viewers with the answer. However, there are many aspects that can be discussed without putting in a ""spoiler."" The ""High"" refers to Gondo's mansion, perched upon a high hill. It also refers to Gondo's position as a wealthy company executive. On the surface, the ""Low"" refers to the slums where poor people and drug-addicts inhabit and where the kidnapper lives and most likely comes from.However, as it turns out, the ""Low"" can also refer to Gondo and his background. During the discussion about how to handle the kidnapping, he reminds his wife about how he had been born of poor and humble origins and has had to work his way up the National Shoe hierarchy by his own efforts. Gondo's background is a factor that can go well over the heads of Western viewers who aren't very familiar with Japanese culture, history, and sociology. In order to understand it, some historical aspects must be studied. The craft of shoe-making, along with other crafts involving leather has been a traditional occupation of the burakumin (outcast) sector of the population.The burakumin, as a people (and as a political/cultural issue) come from the feudal class system, where there were samurai, farmers, artisans, and merchants. There were also two different outcast categories: hinin (""non-human""), and eta (""abundant filth""). The hinin were involved in begging, street-entertaining, and related occupations. The eta were involved in dealing with butchery, handling the dead, and making leather objects and implements (related to dead animal carcasses). People in these outcast classes were considered inferior, not quite human, ritually impure. They were forced to live in segregated neighborhoods and defer to the ""normal human beings"" around them. Killing an eta or a hinin was not considered a crime because they weren't considered to be ""people.""During the Meiji restoration in the late 19th century, the classes were abolished. The former outcasts were supposed to be welcomed into regular society as ""new commoners."" Instead of being ""abundant filth"" or ""non-human,"" they were referred to as ""burakumin"" (""hamlet people""). However, the discrimination and violence against these people continued and continues to this current day. As the years went by, the scorn and discrimination has become hidden, unmentioned, and kept out of view. Some people have said that they don't even know what a ""burakumin"" is, other than something that relates entirely to historical times. However, there have been secret (now-illegal) lists kept of suspected burakumin families, so that companies and marriage brokers could consult these lists and avoid hiring or marrying a person from this ""outcast"" class. There have been writings and studies circulated that burakumin populate most of the violent yakuza gangs and that they even cause AIDS.Now we get back to the film, HIGH AND LOW. Even though this factor isn't explicitly mentioned, it is strongly implied that Gondo Kingo, the self-made shoe-craftsman who has risen to executive, is a member of the burakumin. He started life as a shoe-maker, a leather craftsman. In Japan, very few, if any, people who are not burakumin would enter these leather-crafting professions. No one in the film mentions the burakumin, no one calls Gondo a ""burakumin"" or ""dirty eta"" to his face -- or even openly behind his back. No one would dare. However, one can plainly see a divide between Gondo and the other executives during the entire film. So though Gondo represents the ""high"", he also represents the ""low."" There is a parallel implication that Takeuchi (the kidnapper), though coming from humble origins, is not a burakumin. So though he is the ""low"", he is also the ""high"" compared to Gondo. There are so many ironies that run through this film.I found this film to be quite compelling. If nothing else, the film is a quality ""police procedural."" However, it is far more than that. The film addresses issues of individual moral choices as opposed to materialism. It also addresses issues of class, in very subtle and ironic ways; class distinctions are far more complex than simplistic ""high/low"" concepts.",5,Truly Complex Social Commentary,1217548800,"08 1,

A close to seamless cinema/home-video experience with suspense (the nail-biting kind), intrigue (the edge-of-your-seat kind), thrills (due to an excellent script with many NON-telegraphed twists and turns), terrorism,  kidnapping, restrained but none-the-less powerful acting (mostly involving the director's acting troupe), etc.  The black & white cinematography in ultra wide format (at least 2.35 to 1.0) is often startling with frames always fully utilized (side to side) by the director.  The music score underlines what is on the screen without drawing unnecessary attention to itself.  There are many now classic cinema scenes.  Those in the police station especially stand out.

He is every bit the in-control general, trying to find a strategy that allows him to keep family, fortune and face.  His fortress has been breached by the enemy, and he must first defend then counter-attack.  The enemy is invisible,  hiding in an area of Japan that Mifune knows nothing about.  The drama is tangible.Most of Kurosawa's troupe is here, with familiar faces at every turn.  Yoshio Tsuchiya (the gun-slinger from &quot;Yojimbo&quot;) is one of the good guys this time as a police detective.  Takashi Shimura (Kambei from &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;) is the police director.&quot;High and Low&quot; opened up whole new Kurosawa worlds for me.  &quot;The Bad Sleep Well,&quot; &quot;Stray Dog,&quot; &quot;Drunken Angel,&quot;...I will never again limit myself to swords and top-nots.
