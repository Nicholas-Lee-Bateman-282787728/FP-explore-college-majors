1019464,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B000I8OMBM,Arcadio Bolaos,"[1, 2]","Many pages have been written regarding masturbatory dynamics. In Michele Foucault'sThe History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction, there is a thorough analysis of Victorian Age approach towards onanism. According to scientific minds of that era, this self-abuse practice would not only be physically perilous and thus deemed as a menace for a society who would seek healthier reproduction procedures, but also it would morally impeach whoever did it. After all, masturbation required fantasy, id est, one must fantasize about whatever it is considered enticing (which would greatly vary depending on the subject) in order to ensure this private act.Much could be said about erotic reinforcement in masturbatory sessions, but it all boils down to one single element: fantasy. Sometimes, most of the times, fantasy is a social construct that reflects easily on a certain kind of man or woman. We're told what to desire, what to look for, and sometimes it becomes increasingly difficult to look outside pre-established parameters.""Latch Key"" revolves around two particular moments: The mutual masturbation that takes place between Sam and Thomas; and sexual intercourse between Lou (Sam's brother) and a girl. The two boys get together to watch a porno movie while masturbating each other. As one learns through the dialogue, this is an activity that has been going on for long. For Thomas it all comes down to one point ""better than doing it myself""; for Sam, on the contrary, everything is about Thomas. Because Sam does not pay attention to the guy-on-girl sex tape, his eyes are glued onto his young friend's body. Watching the video provides Thomas with the right fantasy to carry on this activity. Sam's situation is more complicated, as he wishes a most intimate contact, his desire is to break the masturbation barrier and engage Thomas in more satisfying acts. Thomas presence then acts upon Sam as the reinforcement of fantasy, though it's not the fulfillment of fantasy, far from it.On the other hand, Lou makes every effort to get the girl naked. All she wants is to know if they'll get back together and if he loves her or not. The only thing Lou wants is to have sex. To have fun before his mom arrives from work.Nevertheless we must address this poignant nonchalant approach to teenage sex. In the first case, masturbation is a game of fantasies staged through different points of view. In the second case, sex is more akin to masturbation than anything else, after all Lou's major concern is to ejaculate in a warm body before it's too late. It's the selfishness of Lou's character that nullifies intercourse as a meaningful act. And it's the naivet&eacute; of Sam that transforms the shared hand job into the previous step before sex. Whether or not real sex will happen for either of them is something we can only guess at.",3,Latch Key: Teenage sexual urges,1319932800,"10 30, 2011",2011,2841,"['Many', 'pages', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'regarding', 'masturbatory', 'dynamics', 'Michele', ""Foucault'sThe"", 'History', 'Sexuality', 'Vol', '1', 'Introduction', 'thorough', 'analysis', 'Victorian', 'Age', 'approach', 'towards', 'onanism', 'According', 'scientific', 'minds', 'era', 'self-abuse', 'practice', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'physically', 'perilous', 'thus', 'deemed', 'menace', 'society', 'who', 'would', 'seek', 'healthier', 'reproduction', 'procedures', 'also', 'would', 'morally', 'impeach', 'whoever', 'did', 'masturbation', 'required', 'fantasy', 'id', 'est', 'one', 'must', 'fantasize', 'whatever', 'considered', 'enticing', 'would', 'greatly', 'vary', 'depending', 'subject', 'order', 'ensure', 'private', 'act.Much', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'erotic', 'reinforcement', 'masturbatory', 'sessions', 'down', 'one', 'single', 'element', 'fantasy', 'Sometimes', 'most', 'times', 'fantasy', 'social', 'construct', 'easily', 'certain', 'kind', 'man', 'woman', ""'re"", 'told', 'what', 'desire', 'what', 'look', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'look', 'outside', 'pre-established', 'parameters', 'Latch', 'Key', 'around', 'two', 'particular', 'moments', 'mutual', 'masturbation', 'place', 'Sam', 'Thomas', 'sexual', 'intercourse', 'Lou', 'Sam', 'brother', 'girl', 'two', 'boys', 'get', 'together', 'watch', 'porno', 'movie', 'masturbating', 'other', 'one', 'dialogue', 'activity', 'been', 'going', 'long', 'Thomas', 'down', 'one', 'point', 'better', 'doing', 'Sam', 'contrary', 'everything', 'Thomas', 'Sam', 'not', 'pay', 'attention', 'guy-on-girl', 'sex', 'tape', 'eyes', 'are', 'glued', 'young', 'friend', 'body', 'Watching', 'video', 'Thomas', 'right', 'fantasy', 'carry', 'activity', 'Sam', 'situation', 'more', 'complicated', 'most', 'intimate', 'contact', 'desire', 'break', 'masturbation', 'barrier', 'engage', 'Thomas', 'more', 'satisfying', 'acts', 'Thomas', 'presence', 'then', 'upon', 'Sam', 'reinforcement', 'fantasy', 'not', 'fulfillment', 'fantasy', 'far', 'it.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Lou', 'effort', 'get', 'girl', 'naked', 'know', ""'ll"", 'get', 'back', 'together', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'Lou', 'have', 'sex', 'have', 'fun', 'mom', 'work.Nevertheless', 'must', 'address', 'poignant', 'nonchalant', 'approach', 'teenage', 'sex', 'first', 'case', 'masturbation', 'game', 'fantasies', 'staged', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'second', 'case', 'sex', 'more', 'akin', 'masturbation', 'anything', 'else', 'Lou', 'major', 'concern', 'ejaculate', 'warm', 'body', 'too', 'late', 'selfishness', 'Lou', 'character', 'intercourse', 'meaningful', 'act', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'Sam', 'shared', 'hand', 'job', 'previous', 'step', 'sex', 'not', 'real', 'sex', 'will', 'happen', 'something', 'can', 'only', 'guess']",N/A

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[5, 5]","These eight short films, some of them so short that they barely get started before they are over, are introduced by a young man whom we first see taking a shower. At least he is not a hustler as in ""Boys Briefs 4"". He tells us that these films are all connected in that they are about ""hooking up."" The eight films in the order they are on the DVD: (1) ""Cabalero"" directed by Jarrah Gurrie; (2) ""Shakespeare's Sonnets"" by Samuel Park; (3) ""David"" by Robert Fiesco; (4) ""Boys Grammar"" by Dean Francis; (5) ""Latchkey"" by Garth Bardsley; (6) Little Boy Blues"" by John McCrite; (7) ""Between the Boys"" by Jake Yuzna and (8) ""Postmortem"" by Eldar Rapaport.""In accompanying footage to the films, the directors, likeable to a person, talk about their works and explain what they hoped to achieve. Samuel Park, for example, reminds us that he had to cut out some of the dialogue that would have let us know that the two characters, students at Harvard in the 1940's and inspired by the book and film ""Maurice"" were caught up in trying to find out if Shakespeare wrote his sonnets for a young man. Since we don't have that piece of information, unfortunately the film doesn't quite make sense although the chemistry between the two young men works.""Boys Grammar""-- sad to say-- is based on actual events in boys' boarding schools in Australia, in this instance a gang rape of one of the young men. ""Latchkey"" has a nice element of suspense as two different couples engage in various stages of coupling before the mother gets home from work. ""Little Boy Blues"" is one of the better contributions and deals with the subject of safer sex after the first round of AIDS deaths. One of the men involved in the tryst is an older man whose lover has died of AIDS. He meets a younger man who will try any drug he can get his hands on to enhance the sex. There is an element of danger in the film that is effective as is the lighting, much of which is in shades of blue.""Between the Boys"" is over almost before it starts although it is beautifully shot and covers the subject of incest, a dicey topic at best. My favorite film is the last one ""Postmortem,"" a beautifully nuanced story of two men who meet again several years after they have had an affair for a summer. The acting is quite good, the subject universal. Should they begin again? Who was more wrong? How did each of them get over the other or did they? The ending is ambiguous as we are not sure if they will continue their affair or not.It must be more difficult making an extremely short film than writing a short story, for instance, but some of these writer/directors admirably rise to the occasion.",4,Movies About Hooking Up,1223164800,"10 5, 2008",2008,2646,"['eight', 'short', 'films', 'so', 'short', 'barely', 'get', 'started', 'are', 'are', 'introduced', 'young', 'man', 'whom', 'first', 'see', 'taking', 'shower', 'least', 'not', 'hustler', 'Boys', 'Briefs', '4', 'films', 'are', 'connected', 'are', 'hooking', 'up', 'eight', 'films', 'order', 'are', 'DVD', '1', 'Cabalero', 'directed', 'Jarrah', 'Gurrie', '2', 'Shakespeare', 'Sonnets', 'Samuel', 'Park', '3', 'David', 'Robert', 'Fiesco', '4', 'Boys', 'Grammar', 'Dean', 'Francis', '5', 'Latchkey', 'Garth', 'Bardsley', '6', 'Little', 'Boy', 'Blues', 'John', 'McCrite', '7', 'Boys', 'Jake', 'Yuzna', '8', 'Postmortem', 'Eldar', 'Rapaport', 'accompanying', 'footage', 'films', 'directors', 'likeable', 'person', 'talk', 'works', 'explain', 'what', 'hoped', 'achieve', 'Samuel', 'Park', 'example', 'had', 'cut', 'out', 'dialogue', 'would', 'have', 'let', 'know', 'two', 'characters', 'students', 'Harvard', '1940', 'inspired', 'book', 'film', 'Maurice', 'were', 'caught', 'up', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'Shakespeare', 'wrote', 'sonnets', 'young', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'piece', 'information', 'unfortunately', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'sense', 'chemistry', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'Boys', 'Grammar', 'sad', 'say', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'boys', 'boarding', 'schools', 'Australia', 'instance', 'gang', 'rape', 'one', 'young', 'men', 'Latchkey', 'nice', 'element', 'suspense', 'two', 'different', 'couples', 'engage', 'various', 'stages', 'coupling', 'mother', 'home', 'work', 'Little', 'Boy', 'Blues', 'one', 'better', 'contributions', 'deals', 'subject', 'safer', 'sex', 'first', 'round', 'AIDS', 'deaths', 'One', 'men', 'involved', 'tryst', 'older', 'man', 'lover', 'died', 'AIDS', 'younger', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'try', 'drug', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'enhance', 'sex', 'element', 'danger', 'film', 'effective', 'lighting', 'much', 'shades', 'blue', 'Boys', 'almost', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'subject', 'incest', 'dicey', 'topic', 'best', 'favorite', 'film', 'last', 'one', 'Postmortem', 'beautifully', 'nuanced', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'meet', 'again', 'several', 'years', 'have', 'had', 'affair', 'summer', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'subject', 'universal', 'Should', 'begin', 'again', 'Who', 'was', 'more', 'wrong', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'other', 'did', 'ending', 'ambiguous', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'continue', 'affair', 'not.It', 'must', 'be', 'more', 'difficult', 'making', 'extremely', 'short', 'film', 'writing', 'short', 'story', 'instance', 'writer/directors', 'admirably', 'rise', 'occasion']",N/A
