Gohan eventually joins in on the mix(Krillin too!), but Broly's too strong even for him and things don't look good as a result.  It's going to take a miracle to defeat Broly.

Hardy,"[1, 2]","If anything, sequels to DBZ movies in which you know SON GOKU KILLED THE BAD GUY (sending him into the next world) in the first one, then comes back for vengance, are probably the worse things you can watch in DBZ spinoff movies. Everyone knows that Goku Beat Broly hands down with the Spirit Bomb Energy and Broly was blown to nothing along with the fake planet vegeta they were one. However, someone decided to bring him back, only he's not dead! I just don't see the logical reason of bringing him back Just so, Teen Gohan, Goten, Videl, and Trunks can get the crap beaten out of them and save the day afterward. Movies in which the villain Goku beat comes back is a basicaly insult to his strength (its like saying he beat them, but isn't strong enough to kill them so Teen Gohan has to clean up behind his father). Of course I didn't mind this when Trunks killed Freiza For Goku in the trunks Saga. Goku Meant to mericful that time. Much like ""Bojak Unbound"" This movie is nothing more than a ""in the absence of Goku"" filler movie for the ""Teen Gohan"" character, who was once the coolest during his childhood and during the time he was 11 before and During the Freiza-Namek/Andriod/Cell saga. Gohan is just a bland character now as a teenager. His brother Goten, Videl and Chibi Trunks are yawn fests. None of the original DBZ characters are in the movie if memory serves me correctly.
