For one thing  James Drury wears a terrible toupee, looks bored about half the time, and often wears a slight scowl on his face. During the prime years he showed a much wider range of emotions. Even on the ""A Love to Remember"" episode with Diane Baker, he turns in a flat, non-engaging performance and hardly looks like a man in love.The writing?  Hit and miss.  To be fair, there are some memorable installments but quite a few episodes are rather boring and seem like pale recycles.  At this point the loss of original producer Frank Price was very noticeable.It's easy to see why the final year of this long running series rarely turns up in syndication.It's also easy to understand why the ratings slipped and the once proud and extraordinary Virginian got cancelled.",3,A Drop-Off in Quality for the Final Season,1404432000,"07 4, 2014",2014,881,"['are', 'still', 'good', 'episodes', 'here', 'clearly', 'tank', 'was', 'starting', 'run', 'out', 'gas', 'Virginian', 'one', 'thing', 'James', 'Drury', 'terrible', 'toupee', 'bored', 'time', 'often', 'slight', 'scowl', 'face', 'prime', 'years', 'showed', 'much', 'wider', 'range', 'emotions', 'Even', 'A', 'Love', 'Remember', 'episode', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'flat', 'non-engaging', 'performance', 'hardly', 'man', 'love.The', 'writing', 'Hit', 'miss', 'be', 'fair', 'are', 'memorable', 'installments', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'rather', 'boring', 'seem', 'pale', 'recycles', 'point', 'loss', 'original', 'producer', 'Frank', 'Price', 'was', 'very', 'noticeable.It', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'final', 'year', 'long', 'running', 'series', 'rarely', 'up', 'syndication.It', 'also', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'ratings', 'slipped', 'once', 'proud', 'extraordinary', 'Virginian', 'got', 'cancelled']",The Virginian: Season 8

1338701,ACTMKKP9IA082,B003ES5JOC,paulf,"[7, 7]","Here are capsule impressions of selected episodes from season eight of ""The Virginian,"" another strong season, and the last in its original format.THE LONG RIDE HOME -- Guest stars, Leslie Nielsen, Lonny ChapmanYoung rover must decide whether to stick with his footloose partner or settle at Shiloh. Gritty yarn introduced Tim Matheson's likable Jim Horn character to the series. Nielsen stands out as usual as a rootless saddle bum. Snowy cattle drive scene is rarity for show commonly situated in a perpetually sunny studio Wyoming.A FLASH OF DARKNESS -- Guest stars, James Whitmore, Pamela McMylerSightless after a head injury, The Virginian is nursed by a horse thief's daughter. Depicting the terror and bewilderment of the newly blind pushes Drury well outside his comfort zone, but he delivers a tour de force, possibly his best work in the series' entire nine-year run. A restrained Whitmore and winsome McMyler also resonate. Music by Leonard Rosenman.THE POWER SEEKERS -- Guest stars, Barry Sullivan, Andrew Prine, Davey DavisonClay Grainger is deceived into entering an election race that soon becomes nasty. Astute scenario by Robert Van Scoyk turns a legislative contest in Wyoming territory into a microcosm of the lying, corruption, double-dealing and dirty tricks so ingrained in American politics. Sullivan does a masterful Abe Lincoln slouch as an aging lawmaker who's fed up and wants to quit.THE RUNAWAY -- Guest stars, Guy Stockwell, Peter Whitney, Jan Shepard, Johnnie WhitakerBoy abused by cruel custodian escapes to seek his father, who's the Medicine Bow town drunk. Future movie Tom Sawyer Whitaker gets a head start in this Twain-influenced tale. Treacly outcome is averted through a jarring late plot twist. Stockwell is excellent as the haggard, self-pitying soak. Composer Fred Steiner, best known for the ""Perry Mason"" theme, wrote the sympathetic score.A LOVE TO REMEMBER -- Guest stars, Diane Baker, Fred BeirThe Virginian's growing attachment to a woman from the East is marred by traumatic memories from her past, which resurface in Medicine Bow. Baker performs with stylish grace in romantic puzzle carefully assembled by director Joseph Pevney. Less serious-minded viewers may notice that while Drury is brooding over his rupturing love affair, McClure is having a barrel of fun: Trampas dates a trapeze performer, wins a sack race and spins a nonsensical whopper about a hoop snake.A TOUCH OF HANDS -- Guest stars, Belinda Montgomery, Michael ConstantineTrampas agrees to marry an eastern-educated girl despite her fanciful notions about ranch life. Realistic drama written by John Dunkel gives western mythology a sharp poke in the eye. McClure and John McIntire share a high comedy moment: Trampas has to ask Grainger for a loan but goes completely tongue-tied.JOURNEY TO SCATHELOCK -- Guest stars, Anne Helm, Burr DeBenningHorn chases a bitter saloon girl and her crony after they scam him out of Shiloh cash. Helm's richly detailed portrayal of the unhappy tart paints some color into routine story further lifted by a glorious tall-pine location shoot. Tame conclusion to this and many other season eight episodes reflected an ongoing NBC network anti-violence kick.NIGHTMARE -- Guest star, Joan CrawfordA widow struggles to keep her sanity after being accused of murder. Hollywood legend Crawford is up to her ears in trouble in this loaded melodrama, co-written by actress Bethel Leslie, that makes ""Mildred Pierce"" look like a cakewalk by comparison. Crawford's a bit long in the tooth for it, but watching her is like flipping through the last pages of a cherished family album.A KING'S RANSOM -- Guest stars, Patrick Macnee, Jackie DeShannonThree Aussie outlaws kidnap Grainger. Tattered script leaves plot gaps wide enough to drive cattle through. A waste of time for everyone, especially pop singer DeShannon in a nondescript acting fling.THE SINS OF THE FATHER -- Guest star, Robert LiptonMysterious gunman who rescued The Virginian from robbers hires on at Shiloh despite his obvious hatred of Grainger. Dandyish Lipton, brother of ""The Mod Squad"" star Peggy, scores as the fast draw with a hidden agenda. Cagey script wrings a nifty variation out of cliched showdown-at-sunset climax from Owen Wister's novel. Tim McIntire brings Falstaffian good cheer to his brief part as real-life gunslinger John Wesley Hardin.",4,Virginian episodes,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,4367,"['Here', 'are', 'capsule', 'impressions', 'selected', 'episodes', 'season', 'eight', 'Virginian', 'strong', 'season', 'last', 'original', 'format.THE', 'LONG', 'RIDE', 'HOME', 'Guest', 'stars', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'Lonny', 'ChapmanYoung', 'rover', 'must', 'decide', 'stick', 'footloose', 'partner', 'settle', 'Shiloh', 'Gritty', 'yarn', 'introduced', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'likable', 'Jim', 'Horn', 'character', 'series', 'Nielsen', 'out', 'as', 'usual', 'rootless', 'saddle', 'bum', 'Snowy', 'cattle', 'drive', 'scene', 'rarity', 'show', 'commonly', 'situated', 'perpetually', 'sunny', 'studio', 'Wyoming.A', 'FLASH', 'OF', 'DARKNESS', 'Guest', 'stars', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'Pamela', 'McMylerSightless', 'head', 'injury', 'Virginian', 'nursed', 'horse', 'thief', 'daughter', 'Depicting', 'terror', 'bewilderment', 'newly', 'blind', 'pushes', 'Drury', 'well', 'comfort', 'zone', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'possibly', 'best', 'work', 'series', 'entire', 'nine-year', 'run', 'restrained', 'Whitmore', 'winsome', 'McMyler', 'also', 'resonate', 'Music', 'Leonard', 'Rosenman.THE', 'POWER', 'SEEKERS', 'Guest', 'stars', 'Barry', 'Sullivan', 'Andrew', 'Prine', 'Davey', 'DavisonClay', 'Grainger', 'deceived', 'entering', 'election', 'race', 'soon', 'nasty', 'Astute', 'scenario', 'Robert', 'Van', 'Scoyk', 'legislative', 'contest', 'Wyoming', 'territory', 'microcosm', 'lying', 'corruption', 'double-dealing', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'so', 'ingrained', 'American', 'politics', 'Sullivan', 'masterful', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'slouch', 'aging', 'lawmaker', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'quit.THE', 'RUNAWAY', 'Guest', 'stars', 'Guy', 'Stockwell', 'Peter', 'Whitney', 'Jan', 'Shepard', 'Johnnie', 'WhitakerBoy', 'abused', 'cruel', 'custodian', 'seek', 'father', 'who', 'Medicine', 'Bow', 'town', 'drunk', 'Future', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Whitaker', 'head', 'start', 'Twain-influenced', 'tale', 'Treacly', 'outcome', 'averted', 'jarring', 'late', 'plot', 'twist', 'Stockwell', 'excellent', 'haggard', 'self-pitying', 'soak', 'Composer', 'Fred', 'Steiner', 'best', 'known', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'theme', 'wrote', 'sympathetic', 'score.A', 'LOVE', 'TO', 'REMEMBER', 'Guest', 'stars', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'Fred', 'BeirThe', 'Virginian', 'growing', 'attachment', 'woman', 'East', 'marred', 'traumatic', 'memories', 'past', 'resurface', 'Medicine', 'Bow', 'Baker', 'stylish', 'grace', 'romantic', 'puzzle', 'carefully', 'assembled', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Pevney', 'Less', 'serious-minded', 'viewers', 'may', 'notice', 'Drury', 'brooding', 'rupturing', 'love', 'affair', 'McClure', 'having', 'barrel', 'fun', 'Trampas', 'trapeze', 'performer', 'sack', 'race', 'nonsensical', 'whopper', 'hoop', 'snake.A', 'TOUCH', 'OF', 'HANDS', 'Guest', 'stars', 'Belinda', 'Montgomery', 'Michael', 'ConstantineTrampas', 'marry', 'eastern-educated', 'girl', 'fanciful', 'notions', 'ranch', 'life', 'Realistic', 'drama', 'written', 'John', 'Dunkel', 'western', 'mythology', 'sharp', 'poke', 'eye', 'McClure', 'John', 'McIntire', 'share', 'high', 'comedy', 'moment', 'Trampas', 'ask', 'Grainger', 'loan', 'completely', 'tongue-tied.JOURNEY', 'TO', 'SCATHELOCK', 'Guest', 'stars', 'Anne', 'Helm', 'Burr', 'DeBenningHorn', 'bitter', 'saloon', 'girl', 'crony', 'scam', 'Shiloh', 'cash', 'Helm', 'richly', 'detailed', 'portrayal', 'unhappy', 'tart', 'color', 'routine', 'story', 'further', 'lifted', 'glorious', 'tall-pine', 'location', 'shoot', 'Tame', 'conclusion', 'many', 'other', 'season', 'eight', 'episodes', 'reflected', 'ongoing', 'NBC', 'network', 'anti-violence', 'kick.NIGHTMARE', 'Guest', 'star', 'Joan', 'CrawfordA', 'widow', 'keep', 'sanity', 'being', 'accused', 'murder', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'Crawford', 'up', 'ears', 'trouble', 'loaded', 'melodrama', 'co-written', 'actress', 'Bethel', 'Leslie', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'look', 'cakewalk', 'comparison', 'Crawford', 'bit', 'long', 'tooth', 'watching', 'flipping', 'last', 'pages', 'cherished', 'family', 'KING', 'RANSOM', 'Guest', 'stars', 'Patrick', 'Macnee', 'Jackie', 'DeShannonThree', 'Aussie', 'kidnap', 'Grainger', 'Tattered', 'script', 'plot', 'gaps', 'wide', 'enough', 'drive', 'cattle', 'waste', 'time', 'everyone', 'especially', 'pop', 'singer', 'DeShannon', 'nondescript', 'acting', 'fling.THE', 'SINS', 'THE', 'FATHER', 'Guest', 'star', 'Robert', 'LiptonMysterious', 'gunman', 'who', 'rescued', 'Virginian', 'robbers', 'hires', 'Shiloh', 'obvious', 'hatred', 'Grainger', 'Dandyish', 'Lipton', 'brother', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'star', 'Peggy', 'fast', 'draw', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'Cagey', 'script', 'wrings', 'nifty', 'variation', 'cliched', 'showdown-at-sunset', 'climax', 'Owen', 'Wister', 'novel', 'Tim', 'McIntire', 'Falstaffian', 'good', 'cheer', 'brief', 'part', 'real-life', 'gunslinger', 'John', 'Wesley', 'Hardin']",The Virginian: Season 8

1338703,A2N86H6H7E7K2Y,B003ES5JOC,Randall Becker,"[6, 6]","This season still has many well-written episodes. In my opinion, the two best are ""The Power Seekers"" and ""Rich Man, Poor Man"". ""Power Seekers"" deals well with the issue of back-room politics, and ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" does an excellent job in portraying what happens when people who suddenly become rich have all the wrong ideas on how to handle their wealth.The big problem with the season as a whole is that it's emblematic of the pressures the networks were under in the years just after the MLK and RFK assassinations, and how these pressures really hurt Westerns in particular. These pressures showed most of all in the 1969-1970 season, and they also hurt ""Bonanza"", ""High Chaparral"", ""Daniel Boone"", and ""Lancer"", and probably hastened those shows' cancellations. Only ""Gunsmoke"", thanks to executive producer John Mantley, resisted the pressure as best it could.Yes, I am talking about the ""violence"". Please note that the two episodes I singled out as the best did not have anyone killed. But you really can't carry an adult drama/adventure series, and especially a Western, for a full season without some sense that life-and-death matters may be involved, and without some expectation that some guest characters may not survive. Also, let's be honest: in fiction, you need a sense of justice, and frequently (unlike in real life) this sense of justice is fulfilled with the DEATH of the villain, not just his imprisonment or sticking his hands up. I remember, for instance, being very disappointed in the episode ""Black Jade"" for not killing off Shatner at the end. I agree that it's too predictable and trite when every episode of a series ends with bad guys being shot, but something just as much is lost when NO episode does.Writers during this season were under a lot of pressure from the networks, who in turn were under pressure from Congress, most notably Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island, who was constantly threatening them that if they didn't act to turn all TV drama into something more resembling ""Lassie"" or ""Adam-12"", Congress would. Things got a little more balanced after 1970.So, many good episodes this season, but overall hindered too much by the pressures on the writers.",3,Still well-written but the pressure on the writers (from Senator Pastore et al) hamstrings this season way too much,1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,2205,"['season', 'still', 'many', 'well-written', 'episodes', 'opinion', 'two', 'best', 'are', 'Power', 'Seekers', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'Power', 'Seekers', 'deals', 'well', 'issue', 'back-room', 'politics', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'what', 'when', 'people', 'who', 'suddenly', 'become', 'rich', 'have', 'wrong', 'ideas', 'how', 'handle', 'wealth.The', 'big', 'problem', 'season', 'whole', 'emblematic', 'pressures', 'networks', 'were', 'years', 'just', 'MLK', 'RFK', 'assassinations', 'how', 'pressures', 'really', 'hurt', 'Westerns', 'particular', 'pressures', 'showed', 'most', '1969-1970', 'season', 'also', 'hurt', 'Bonanza', 'High', 'Chaparral', 'Daniel', 'Boone', 'Lancer', 'probably', 'hastened', 'shows', 'cancellations', 'Only', 'Gunsmoke', 'thanks', 'executive', 'producer', 'John', 'Mantley', 'resisted', 'pressure', 'best', 'am', 'talking', 'violence', 'Please', 'note', 'two', 'episodes', 'singled', 'out', 'best', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'anyone', 'killed', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'adult', 'drama/adventure', 'series', 'especially', 'Western', 'full', 'season', 'sense', 'life-and-death', 'matters', 'may', 'be', 'involved', 'expectation', 'guest', 'characters', 'may', 'not', 'survive', 'Also', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'fiction', 'need', 'sense', 'justice', 'frequently', 'real', 'life', 'sense', 'justice', 'fulfilled', 'DEATH', 'villain', 'not', 'just', 'imprisonment', 'sticking', 'hands', 'up', 'remember', 'instance', 'being', 'very', 'disappointed', 'episode', 'Black', 'Jade', 'not', 'killing', 'off', 'Shatner', 'end', 'agree', 'too', 'predictable', 'trite', 'when', 'episode', 'series', 'bad', 'guys', 'being', 'shot', 'something', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'lost', 'when', 'NO', 'episode', 'does.Writers', 'season', 'were', 'lot', 'pressure', 'networks', 'who', 'turn', 'were', 'pressure', 'Congress', 'most', 'notably', 'Senator', 'John', 'Pastore', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'who', 'was', 'constantly', 'threatening', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'turn', 'TV', 'drama', 'something', 'more', 'resembling', 'Lassie', 'Adam-12', 'Congress', 'would', 'Things', 'got', 'little', 'more', 'balanced', '1970.So', 'many', 'good', 'episodes', 'season', 'overall', 'hindered', 'too', 'much', 'pressures', 'writers']",The Virginian: Season 8
