If you are not a fan?  I would suggest Watching not just season 1, but go through season 3.  If you don't like it by then? Most likely it's not for you.  But as A fan, I could not be happier.  I am not sure why season 11 is not out as that is the only season that is left.  They have not started season 12 as of yet but they will this year as they are under contract to do so. Now each season comes with a plastic disk set as if you were to order one season. But they do pair a few seasons up placing two seasons in one set.  But never more then two seasons to a set. And all 10 seasons make up this box set. You get all kind of behind scenes you would never see anywhere including youtube, and you get some insight to what goes on and how Gordon and his personality is when the camera's are not rolling for the show. He is funny, engaging, and really helpful to the young chefs hoping for a shot at the coveted title.  I just cant see how anyone can go wrong getting this as a gift, or for themselves.  I loved it. As I watched it, my sister managed to claim it for her own. So now I must purchase another one.  For 59.99 I think it is a complete steel!  Treat yourself to all this show has to offer, and most of all the scenes you don't see, and the interaction between the chefs and Gordon that make it so you cant take your eyes off the screen.  I know they could come out with two more seasons, one more for sure, and then maybe another box set, but for me it was still worth every penny.  I know we all can find somewhere in a month where we throw away 59.99 in a month. Save that, and use it for countless hours of entertainment.  Watch and enjoy....The personalities of the contestants, sous chef's, and Gordon is just priceless.  5 stars all the way!!!",5,The Product Itself,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,1874,"['are', 'fan', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'then', 'must', 'so', 'much', 'cheaper', 'purchase', 'set', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'would', 'suggest', 'Watching', 'not', 'just', 'season', '1', 'go', 'season', '3', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'then', 'Most', 'likely', 'not', 'A', 'fan', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'happier', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'season', '11', 'not', 'out', 'only', 'season', 'left', 'have', 'not', 'started', 'season', '12', 'yet', 'will', 'year', 'are', 'contract', 'do', 'so', 'Now', 'season', 'plastic', 'disk', 'set', 'were', 'order', 'one', 'season', 'do', 'pair', 'few', 'seasons', 'up', 'placing', 'two', 'seasons', 'one', 'set', 'never', 'more', 'then', 'two', 'seasons', 'set', '10', 'seasons', 'make', 'up', 'box', 'set', 'get', 'kind', 'behind', 'scenes', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'anywhere', 'including', 'youtube', 'get', 'insight', 'what', 'how', 'Gordon', 'personality', 'when', 'camera', 'are', 'not', 'rolling', 'show', 'funny', 'engaging', 'really', 'helpful', 'young', 'chefs', 'hoping', 'shot', 'coveted', 'title', 'just', 'cant', 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'getting', 'gift', 'loved', 'watched', 'sister', 'managed', 'claim', 'own', 'So', 'now', 'must', 'purchase', 'one', '59.99', 'think', 'complete', 'steel', 'Treat', 'show', 'offer', 'most', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'interaction', 'chefs', 'Gordon', 'make', 'cant', 'take', 'eyes', 'screen', 'know', 'could', 'come', 'out', 'two', 'more', 'seasons', 'one', 'more', 'sure', 'then', 'maybe', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'still', 'worth', 'penny', 'know', 'can', 'find', 'somewhere', 'month', 'where', 'throw', 'away', '59.99', 'month', 'Save', 'use', 'countless', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'Watch', 'enjoy', '.The', 'personalities', 'contestants', 'sous', 'chef', 'Gordon', 'just', 'priceless', '5', 'stars', 'way']",Hell'S Kitchen Season 1-10
