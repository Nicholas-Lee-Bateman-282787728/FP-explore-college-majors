312992,ATC2WM08ZF9C1,6302450179,book worm,"[3, 6]","This is a very slow paced melodramatic movie which I thought was too ""chippy"" and ""self-congratulatory"" for the subject of the film, the plight of the Cheyenne who were driven from their homelands. There's the good Quaker woman, ""friend Ness,"" who ran a school for the Indian children to learn the language of the white men and upon greeting the children would make them recite the alphabet on the spot... Then there's the bad officer in command who doesn't enjoy ""babysitting"" the Indians and doesn't think twice in showing force against them; Friend Ness' uncle who doesn't have much of a role, the good wise older captain who dresses not in military clothing like the rest of his troop, but rather in cowboy apparel, kind of like Marlboro Man; and the young hot-headed sargent holding a personal grudge against the Indians.On the Indian side, you have pretty much the same cast of characters, except they are Indian, of course. There's the grumpy mad elder cheif who dies passing cheifhood to the bad Indian. The good older Indian who is the counterpart of the good captain. The young, impatient Indian who fires the first shot and attracts the eye of female admirers with his bare chest. And then there's ""Spanish Woman,"" Ness' counterpart on the Indian side of characters and as she is called by Ness. Here I am confused. Why is she called Spanish woamn? I don't get it, and doesn't she have a name other than Spanish Woman.Both sides have the same conflicts acted out between good and bad guys and gals, which I do not find very realistic.Just as the movie finally gets moving, the story gets interrupted out of nowhere with a depiction of Wyatt Earp in Dodge City, Kansas which adds nothing of importance to the main story, other than to throw in something that has nothing to do with anything and perhaps cast James Stewart in the role as Wyatt Earp.By the time the movie steers back to the main story, my eyes became very heavy and I fell asleep.If you need a movie to put you to sleep, this will do the job. I give the movie two stars for the beautiful cinematography and for the subject matter.

312993,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,6302450179,Chrijeff,"[4, 4]","Based upon Mari Sandoz's bookCheyenne Autumn (Second Edition), which was actually an early example of what Truman Capote called a ""nonfiction novel,"" this final Western by director John Ford (he made only two more films before retiring and died nine years later) fictionalizes and broadens the original while still sticking closely to the basic events.  It's 1878, and the Northern Cheyennes have languished for a year in the arid Indian Territory, dying of measles and malaria and insufficient food.  When a Congressional committee that was supposed to come and hear their grievances fails to appear, the three chiefs--Tall Tree (Victor Jory), Dull Knife (Gilbert Roland), and Little Wolf (Ricardo Montalban)--resolve to lead their people back to their northern-plains homeland, and an epic flight begins.  Pursuing the fugitives is Capt. Thomas Archer (Richard Widmark), the chief security officer at the Reservation, who has fought them and respects them as warriors, and, like many long-time frontier officers, is disgusted by the Government's cavalier way of ignoring or breaking its promises to the Indians; travelling with them, in hopes of helping the many orphan children, is Deborah Wright (Carroll Baker), the Quaker schoolteacher.  As the Indians' flight stretches through weeks and months, even young Lt. Scott (Patrick Wayne), who begins with a fire-breathing urge to avenge his father (killed in the Fetterman Massacre of 12 years earlier) on Indian--any Indians--comes to feel respect and compassion for them, and when they surrender to by-the-book Prussian-born Capt. Wessells (Karl Malden) of Fort Robinson and are faced with the prospect of a murderous winter march back to the Territory, Archer takes a wild gamble and heads for Washington to seek help from Interior Secretary Carl Schurz (Edward G. Robinson in a pivotal role).Some viewers may take issue with the casting of non-Indians in the major Indian roles--Jory, Roland, Montalban, Sal Mineo as Dull Knife's impulsive young warrior-son Red Shirt, Dolores Del Rio as his mother (though she at least is established early on as not an Indian by blood, but a Mexican captive named Spanish Woman who has become Cheyenne herself over her many years with the tribe)--but it's worth keeping in mind that in the 1960's there really weren't very many Indian actors in Hollywood to choose from, and at least Ford does use the Navajos of Monument Valley, who knew him well, as extras.  (It's sad that Ford stalwarts Ben Johnson, as Pvt. Plumtree, and Harry Carey, Jr., as Pvt. Smith, aren't credited; several of Plumtree's lines are reminiscent of Johnson's turn as Sgt. Tyree inShe Wore a Yellow Ribbon.)  The presence of Widmark and Baker as sympathetic POV characters helps to emphasize the raw deal the Indians got, and though the Monument Valley scenery isn't quite right for the facts of the journey, it's magnificent as always.  There are also several good battle scenes and two really excellent quieter ones--the night departure of the Indians from the reservation, and their creative circumvention of a railroad line in their path.  Though perhaps not a perfect example of the Fordian oeuvre (the whole Dodge City sequence could probably have been dispensed with), it's a good closing piece for the famed director and an affecting story.",4,The chronicle of a desperate journey,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,3312,"['Based', 'Mari', 'Sandoz', 'bookCheyenne', 'Autumn', 'Second', 'Edition', 'was', 'actually', 'early', 'example', 'what', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'called', 'nonfiction', 'novel', 'final', 'Western', 'director', 'John', 'Ford', 'made', 'only', 'two', 'more', 'films', 'retiring', 'died', 'nine', 'years', 'later', 'fictionalizes', 'original', 'while', 'still', 'sticking', 'closely', 'basic', 'events', '1878', 'Northern', 'Cheyennes', 'have', 'languished', 'year', 'arid', 'Indian', 'Territory', 'dying', 'measles', 'malaria', 'insufficient', 'food', 'When', 'Congressional', 'committee', 'was', 'supposed', 'come', 'hear', 'grievances', 'appear', 'three', 'chiefs', 'Tree', 'Victor', 'Jory', 'Dull', 'Knife', 'Gilbert', 'Roland', 'Little', 'Wolf', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'resolve', 'lead', 'people', 'back', 'northern-plains', 'homeland', 'epic', 'flight', 'Pursuing', 'fugitives', 'Capt', 'Thomas', 'Archer', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'chief', 'security', 'officer', 'Reservation', 'who', 'fought', 'respects', 'warriors', 'many', 'long-time', 'frontier', 'officers', 'disgusted', 'Government', 'cavalier', 'way', 'ignoring', 'breaking', 'promises', 'Indians', 'travelling', 'hopes', 'helping', 'many', 'orphan', 'children', 'Deborah', 'Wright', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'Quaker', 'schoolteacher', 'Indians', 'flight', 'stretches', 'weeks', 'months', 'even', 'young', 'Lt.', 'Scott', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'who', 'fire-breathing', 'urge', 'avenge', 'father', 'killed', 'Fetterman', 'Massacre', '12', 'years', 'earlier', 'Indian', 'Indians', 'feel', 'respect', 'compassion', 'when', 'surrender', 'by-the-book', 'Prussian-born', 'Capt', 'Wessells', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Fort', 'Robinson', 'are', 'faced', 'prospect', 'murderous', 'winter', 'march', 'back', 'Territory', 'Archer', 'wild', 'gamble', 'heads', 'Washington', 'seek', 'help', 'Interior', 'Secretary', 'Carl', 'Schurz', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'pivotal', 'role', '.Some', 'viewers', 'may', 'take', 'issue', 'casting', 'non-Indians', 'major', 'Indian', 'roles', 'Jory', 'Roland', 'Montalban', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'Dull', 'Knife', 'impulsive', 'young', 'warrior-son', 'Red', 'Shirt', 'Dolores', 'Del', 'Rio', 'mother', 'least', 'established', 'early', 'not', 'Indian', 'blood', 'Mexican', 'captive', 'named', 'Spanish', 'Woman', 'who', 'become', 'Cheyenne', 'many', 'years', 'tribe', 'worth', 'keeping', 'mind', '1960', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'many', 'Indian', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'choose', 'least', 'Ford', 'use', 'Navajos', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'who', 'knew', 'well', 'extras', 'sad', 'Ford', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Pvt', 'Plumtree', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'Pvt', 'Smith', 'are', ""n't"", 'credited', 'several', 'Plumtree', 'lines', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'Johnson', 'turn', 'Sgt', 'Tyree', 'inShe', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'presence', 'Widmark', 'Baker', 'sympathetic', 'POV', 'characters', 'emphasize', 'raw', 'deal', 'Indians', 'got', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'scenery', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'facts', 'journey', 'magnificent', 'always', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'good', 'battle', 'scenes', 'two', 'really', 'excellent', 'quieter', 'ones', 'night', 'departure', 'Indians', 'reservation', 'creative', 'circumvention', 'railroad', 'line', 'path', 'perhaps', 'not', 'perfect', 'example', 'Fordian', 'oeuvre', 'whole', 'Dodge', 'City', 'sequence', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'dispensed', 'good', 'closing', 'piece', 'famed', 'director', 'affecting', 'story']",N/A

I saw it on DVD last night for the first time in many years and really enjoyed it.  Filmed mostly in Monument Vally in 70mm, this is Ford's most beautiful film since ""The Searchers.""  Almost every scene is a pleasure to look at.  The film has been remastered for DVD and looks great.The film is a sympathetic portrayal of the Cheyenne Indian 1500 mile trek from their reservation in Arizona to their original location.  It stars Richard Widmark as a sympathetic Army Captain assigned to bring them back.  We sometimes forget what a fine leading-man Widmark was and he is terrific here.  (Ford used so many great Hollywood leading men in his films: The great Duke Wayne, of course, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, etc.  Widmark and Stewart previously co-starred in Ford's ""Two Rode Together."")  Widmark's love-interest is played by Carroll Baker, one of my favorite actresses of the 1960s.  The indians are portrayed by all non-indians: three hispanic actors: Ricardo Montalban, Gilbert Roland and Dolores Del Rio, an Italian-American: Sal Mineo, and a fine character-actor: Victor Jory.  Edweard G. Robinson is very good as the Secretary of the Interior, Carl Schurz.  The one major-misfire is a long-winded comedy sequence with James Stewart seriously miscast as an idiotic Wyatt Earp and Arthur Kennedy even more-miscast as a quiet-spoken Doc Holliday.  It also feature Ken Curtis, (Ford's son-in-law,) a/k/a Festus Haggen on ""Gunsmoke"" as a sadistic indian-killer.  This entire scene is very out of place and hurts the film.The music is by Alex North, one of the greatest film composers.  (He did one of my all-time favorite scores for ""Spartacus."")

The cast is solid even though Richard Widmark does not have the presence or charisma of John Wayne, Ford's usual leading man. This is a well intentioned film just the same.To the contrary of critical opinion, I enjoyed the Dodge City sequence with Arthur Kennedy as Doc Holliday and James Stewart as Wyatt Earp. Some say it does not fit the serious and solemn tone of the rest of the film. That is true to some extent, but the juxtaposition of cinematic styles acts to bring attention to the Indian's plight. The outrageous and bawdy nature of the Dodge City sequence shows that the imported eastern notions of a superior and sophisticated transplanted European civilization are not sophisticated at all. They bring chaos rather than harmony to the land on their Westward expansion.In another scene, Karl Malden's performance as Capt. Oskar Wessels is over the top, yet his foreign accent and the fort he commands stand as a metaphor for the Nazi concentration camps of WWII. Sean McClory as Dr. O'Carberry brings stability and compassion to this awkward scene.It was good to Patrick Wayne on hand and many of Ford's troupe of actors including Ken Curtis, John Carradine, Danny Borzage, Chuck Hayward, Mae Marsh, Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr.Mike Mazurki's soliloquy to Richard Widmark on the insignificance and effectives of his role as Sr. First Sergeant in the infantry is memorable and touching.William H.

It is not a typical Ford Western, though.  Yes, it's filmed in Monumental Valley, and it boasts some of the greatest cinemtography ever in a Ford film.  Yet, it seems rambling, even disjointed at times.  It is Ford's longest work (clocking in at, for Ford at least, a long 158 minutes), and it feels like it could have used a little editing.  There isn't much humour in it, except for the Dodge City episode, which is awkwardly inserted into the middle of the film.  It really seems out of place because the rest of the film is very serious with very little comic relief included.  But the episode itself is actually one of Ford's funniest scenes EVER.  The banter between James Stewart, Burt Kennedy, John Carradine, and Elizabeth Allen is hilarious.  The scene was originally cut out of the initial theatrical version, but then later restored for VHS/DVD releases.  Ford seems to be trying something new here, but just not getting it right.  This film is missing the poetry that is in many of his other Westerns.  The film comes across as rather preachy, ponderous, and lumbering (even though the subject matter is definitely important).  Tag Gallagher's book on Ford, he states that Ford wanted to cast actual Native Americans in the roles of Montalban, Mineo, and Roland, treating them like a Greek Chorus unable to communicate with the whites.  This idea was rejected by the producers of the film.  He reportedly didn't care for Alex North's score, either.  Ford films always had a more traditional, folk tinged score that was used sparingly throughout his films.  North's score underscores almost every scene, here.  It is nice, however, to see this film widescreen.  Before, it was only available in wretched, pan and scan versions, which absolutely butchered Ford's compositions.  Here we get to see the spectacular photography by William Clothier, who shot this film in 70mm.  Ford only completed one more feature film after this (the underrated Seven Women), and this ended up being his final Western.  It's worth watching, for sure (especially if you're a Ford admirer), but it is not one of his better films.",3,"Uneven, disjointed, but worth watching...",1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,2268,"['John', 'Ford', 'last', 'Western', 'film', 'make', 'amends', 'films', 'rather', 'shabby', 'treatment', 'Native', 'Americans', 'not', 'typical', 'Ford', 'Western', 'though', 'Yes', 'filmed', 'Monumental', 'Valley', 'greatest', 'cinemtography', 'ever', 'Ford', 'film', 'rambling', 'even', 'disjointed', 'times', 'Ford', 'longest', 'work', 'clocking', 'Ford', 'least', 'long', '158', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'editing', ""n't"", 'much', 'humour', 'Dodge', 'City', 'episode', 'awkwardly', 'inserted', 'middle', 'film', 'really', 'place', 'rest', 'film', 'very', 'serious', 'very', 'little', 'comic', 'relief', 'included', 'episode', 'actually', 'one', 'Ford', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'EVER', 'banter', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Burt', 'Kennedy', 'John', 'Carradine', 'Elizabeth', 'Allen', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'was', 'originally', 'cut', 'initial', 'theatrical', 'version', 'then', 'later', 'restored', 'VHS/DVD', 'releases', 'Ford', 'be', 'trying', 'something', 'new', 'here', 'just', 'not', 'getting', 'right', 'film', 'missing', 'poetry', 'many', 'other', 'Westerns', 'film', 'across', 'rather', 'preachy', 'ponderous', 'lumbering', 'even', 'subject', 'matter', 'definitely', 'important', 'Tag', 'Gallagher', 'book', 'Ford', 'Ford', 'wanted', 'cast', 'actual', 'Native', 'Americans', 'roles', 'Montalban', 'Mineo', 'Roland', 'treating', 'Greek', 'Chorus', 'unable', 'communicate', 'whites', 'idea', 'was', 'rejected', 'producers', 'film', 'reportedly', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Alex', 'North', 'score', 'Ford', 'always', 'had', 'more', 'traditional', 'folk', 'tinged', 'score', 'was', 'used', 'sparingly', 'films', 'North', 'score', 'almost', 'scene', 'here', 'nice', 'however', 'see', 'film', 'widescreen', 'was', 'only', 'available', 'wretched', 'pan', 'scan', 'versions', 'absolutely', 'butchered', 'Ford', 'compositions', 'Here', 'get', 'see', 'spectacular', 'photography', 'William', 'Clothier', 'who', 'shot', 'film', '70mm', 'Ford', 'only', 'completed', 'one', 'more', 'feature', 'film', 'underrated', 'Seven', 'Women', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'final', 'Western', 'worth', 'watching', 'sure', 'especially', ""'re"", 'Ford', 'admirer', 'not', 'one', 'better', 'films']",N/A

313014,A376UHS8GODI8W,6302450179,Patrick Selitrenny,"[19, 25]","Granted, it might not be a glorious John Ford movie as his earlier works, but in this one attempt one might recognize the soul of the director, a troubled soul.He had always depicted the native Americans as being merely a detail in American history, and now, having reached the sunset and the winter of his own life - and probably some wisdom as well, he comes out in the open and seems to ask for forgiveness.It is a touching attempt at redemption and as such it should be considered. Ford was deeply religious, even though he never openly admitted it and here it shows.Of course it is at times naive, at times superficial and at times kitsch, but this is also the the true and touching opening of an old man who has realized that his own world has changed and the views of the people have changed.He is desperately trying to get in touch and in synchrony with this new world and admits the faults and mistakes that some of his forefathers have committed against defenseless and hopeless people.This movie is probably more his own introspection before his death and at the same time is the heritage he wanted to leave us before his demise.This is why I wouldn't be so harsh as to trash it so swiftly.Even though somewhat naive in its views, the story of the Lakota/Dakota tribes being deported and so shamelessly persecuted by the American Government in those far away days is absolutely true.It is a piece of American history that so many Americans would like to see being forgotten but occasionally pops up to hunt us as a reminder that any civilization can produce unspeakable horrors, especially when it feels socially superior.What I would mostly criticize is the fact that all American native parts were cast with other minorities, especially of hispanic origin (Gilbert Roland and Ricardo Montalban, two of the best and finest actors of Latin origin who, unfortunately for those years, were so many times misused and typecast).But all this does not come as a surprise if one consider that certain racial practices were still in effect in those days. We are four years away from 1968 and Martin Luther King and the road to parity for American natives will be even longer than that...The film is slow paced on purpose, in order for the audience to absorb the atrocity of the situation in which the American natives, in this case the Cheyennes, are forced to live.The U.S. Government is not depicted as one homogeneous force as it may have been later on in history, but rather as a bunch of newly arrived groups of Europeans who intend to take a foothold on the American Continent in order to pursue an all out colonization of the Land.A very similar situation to that of the British confronted with the Zulus in South Africa.Right or wrong is not contemplated in this movie. History here is what it was, crude and cruel. It's the affirmation of one Society over another. People don't count...But this is exactly where this movie is highly revealing: the people involved. History is just a poor excuse to handle people as cattle.It's the interior conflicts of the people that appear in this work that make it so worthwhile. Whites, as well as American natives, seem uncomfortable with the situation at hand and struggle uneasily against the winds of Power.A Power always felt but never seen. An Evil force that drives people to do what they do because they are meant to do it. But this evil force is never clearly seen and never takes a firm foothold in one or more people.This is why everything in this movie seems to be at once so confused and at the same time so desperate. The movie asks who these people really are and what they really want from life, but also shows us that they all are pawns in this immense chess game and no one can really do what he would like to do.Here, John Ford's image of his interior struggle taking place is very clearly recognizable. It's as if he's trying to tell us that he has always tried to do what was right but never really what he truly wanted to do... and that he was probably sorry never to be able to unchain himself from the system.The true message to us and the legacy he is trying to convey is not to allow others to take us as hostages but rather to fight such people with all our strength because otherwise we might land up as slaves.In as much, the movie is revolutionary for its times. In other words this is a multilayered work of art that is well worth watching in its subtle net of subplots that hide messages reserved to those who can read them.It's much less a Western than a History lesson, but so much more a last ""J'accuse"" from the author of the most memorable Westerns ever made and the most controversial director of his times.If you know how to read John Ford, then this movie will reveal him to you like none other before.If you're out for another conventional John Ford movie than this is certainly not it.It's up to you, but remember, great directors reveal themselves in movies that are usually atypical from their regular genres or themes.",4,John Ford's attempt at making history...,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,5013,"['Granted', 'might', 'not', 'be',

313019,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,6302450179,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 2]","Having read the fine literary version of the same title, I was very curious to see what Hollywood would do with it.  Not that I was optimistic.  The story is a about the tragic end of a free people, the Cheyenne.  Defeated and on promises that they would receive land and provisions, they were relegated to a desert in Oklahoma, where they starved and were victims of disease, dwindling away in the most sordid conditions.  Having waited for over a year, the remaining 300 or so decided the whites didn't live up to their side of the contract and left to return to their homelands in the Yellow Stone.  They had no provisions, very few weapons, and only about 60 braves.  So started a 240-some day trek that ended in death, murder, and long criminal trials, though they won the right to a reservation in Montana.  In the book, there is this sense of the meaningless death of a complex culture.  It is an absolutely awful story of a people trying to flee genocide and spiritual death by administrative oversight.The film begins with a splendidly tragic tone, as acted by the young Ricardo Montalbam, who plays a charismatic chief disgusted by the treatment of his tribe.  This is an unusual step for a major hollywood film, but the traditions of the genre soon betray the many qualities of the production.  There are several interesting military confrontations, with one character growing under the eye of the stern captain.  This is where the story diverges from history in increasingly ridiculous ways.  Set against the Cheyenne is a humanistic captain, who must do his duty but who regrets it more and more, empathizing with the Indians while courting a lovely Quaker woman who elects to travel with them as a nurse (both apocryphal, if memory serves).  Widmark is at his best here.  Unfortunately, the tone deteriorates terribly with a cameo by Jimmy Stewart, who plays a comical Wyatt Earp as he leads a Dodge City saloon crowd on a hunt for the Indians, complete with a portable bar and prostitutes.  It is funny, with a hooker running without her dress when the Indians fire on them, but completely destroys the mood.  There is a notable episode when a group of braves lead people wishing to surrender in winter, only to be imprisonned and told that they must march back to Oklahoma, which they refuse to do on pain of starvation and cold.  Karl Malden plays a stupidly wooden soldier who seeks to force them to submit, while Widmark opposes him and goes to meet the Secretary of the Interior, Edward G. Robinson.  They escape at the cost of many lives.  (In reality, they were captured and broke out.)  By the end, the film is overwhelmed by melodrama.  Widmark's romance advances, while Sal Mineo confronts Montalban over a woman.  It had lost me by this point, so that I wasn't even disappointed by the happy ending they grafted on to such an awful story.Nonetheless, there are interesting aspects to the film, particularly in view of the fact that it was made (in 1964) just before the 60s anti-authoritarian impulse became so commonplace.  Viewers expected heroes and unambiguous outcomes and that is what they got rather than tragedy and gritty realism.  There is a truly outstanding cast that held my attention until it degenerated into a kind of semi-serious shlock.  The documentary in my version, narrated by Stewart, also piles it on with pre-Vietnam optimism and no acknowledgment that there are problems on Indian reservations or even recognizing that the Cheyenne autumn was essentially the end of an ancient culture.  I would give this 3.5 stars and recommend it for film buffs but not for anyone interested in learning the history or simply a good cowboy-indian film:  too schmaltzy for the former, too slow and sad for the latter.  This story required more, much more, not only including tragedy, but also irony, cynicism, and an unflinching, even existential, gaze; it isn't here.  Contrast this with Little Big Man, which instilled a lifelong fascination with indigenous peoples in me, and you will see my point.  LBM was made just 6 years later, a true product of the wider perspctive that the 60s enabled.",3,"hollywood treatment of a disgraceful episode, on the cusp of the 1960s",1344988800,"08 15, 2012",2012,4132,"['Having', 'read', 'fine', 'literary', 'version', 'same', 'title', 'was', 'very', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'do', 'Not', 'was', 'optimistic', 'story', 'tragic', 'end', 'free', 'people', 'Cheyenne', 'Defeated', 'promises', 'would', 'receive', 'land', 'provisions', 'were', 'relegated', 'desert', 'Oklahoma', 'where', 'starved', 'were', 'victims', 'disease', 'dwindling', 'away', 'most', 'sordid', 'conditions', 'Having', 'waited', 'year', 'remaining', '300', 'so', 'decided', 'whites', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'side', 'contract', 'left', 'return', 'homelands', 'Yellow', 'Stone', 'had', 'provisions', 'very', 'few', 'weapons', 'only', 'about', '60', 'braves', 'So', 'started', '240-some', 'day', 'trek', 'ended', 'death', 'murder', 'long', 'criminal', 'trials', 'won', 'right', 'reservation', 'Montana', 'book', 'sense', 'meaningless', 'death', 'complex', 'culture', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'story', 'people', 'trying', 'flee', 'genocide', 'spiritual', 'death', 'administrative', 'oversight.The', 'film', 'splendidly', 'tragic', 'tone', 'acted', 'young', 'Ricardo', 'Montalbam', 'who', 'charismatic', 'chief', 'disgusted', 'treatment', 'tribe', 'unusual', 'step', 'major', 'hollywood', 'film', 'traditions', 'genre', 'soon', 'betray', 'many', 'qualities', 'production', 'are', 'several', 'interesting', 'military', 'confrontations', 'one', 'character', 'growing', 'eye', 'stern', 'captain', 'where', 'story', 'diverges', 'history', 'increasingly', 'ridiculous', 'ways', 'Set', 'Cheyenne', 'humanistic', 'captain', 'who', 'must', 'do', 'duty', 'who', 'more', 'more', 'empathizing', 'Indians', 'courting', 'lovely', 'Quaker', 'woman', 'who', 'travel', 'nurse', 'apocryphal', 'memory', 'serves', 'Widmark', 'best', 'here', 'Unfortunately', 'tone', 'terribly', 'cameo', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'who', 'comical', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'Dodge', 'City', 'saloon', 'crowd', 'hunt', 'Indians', 'complete', 'portable', 'bar', 'prostitutes', 'funny', 'hooker', 'running', 'dress', 'when', 'Indians', 'fire', 'completely', 'mood', 'notable', 'episode', 'when', 'group', 'braves', 'lead', 'people', 'wishing', 'surrender', 'winter', 'only', 'be', 'imprisonned', 'told', 'must', 'march', 'back', 'Oklahoma', 'refuse', 'do', 'pain', 'starvation', 'cold', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'stupidly', 'wooden', 'soldier', 'who', 'force', 'submit', 'Widmark', 'meet', 'Secretary', 'Interior', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'escape', 'cost', 'many', 'lives', 'reality', 'were', 'captured', 'broke', 'out', 'end', 'film', 'overwhelmed', 'melodrama', 'Widmark', 'romance', 'advances', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'confronts', 'Montalban', 'woman', 'had', 'lost', 'point', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'disappointed', 'happy', 'ending', 'grafted', 'awful', 'story.Nonetheless', 'are', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'film', 'particularly', 'view', 'fact', 'was', 'made', '1964', 'just', '60s', 'anti-authoritarian', 'impulse', 'became', 'so', 'commonplace', 'Viewers', 'expected', 'heroes', 'unambiguous', 'outcomes', 'what', 'got', 'rather', 'tragedy', 'gritty', 'realism', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'held', 'attention', 'degenerated', 'kind', 'semi-serious', 'shlock', 'documentary', 'version', 'narrated', 'Stewart', 'also', 'pre-Vietnam', 'optimism', 'acknowledgment', 'are', 'problems', 'Indian', 'reservations', 'even', 'recognizing', 'Cheyenne', 'autumn', 'was', 'essentially', 'end', 'ancient', 'culture', 'would', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'recommend', 'film', 'buffs', 'not', 'anyone', 'interested', 'learning', 'history', 'simply', 'good', 'cowboy-indian', 'film', 'too', 'schmaltzy', 'former', 'too', 'slow', 'sad', 'latter', 'story', 'required', 'more', 'much', 'more', 'not', 'only', 'including', 'tragedy', 'also', 'irony', 'cynicism', 'unflinching', 'even', 'existential', 'gaze', ""n't"", 'here', 'Contrast', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'instilled', 'lifelong', 'fascination', 'indigenous', 'peoples', 'will', 'see', 'point', 'LBM', 'was', 'made', 'just', '6', 'years', 'later', 'true', 'product', 'wider', 'perspctive', '60s', 'enabled']",N/A

They were unwanted in what the whites wanted to make of the West and so they were 'placed' and disposed of, thereby suffering the usual 'superfluous' maladies of physical and moral debilitation... Here they are portrayed as the victims of insensitive herding...The Cheyennes--1,500 miles away in Oklahoma from their Yellowstone home--had seen their numbers depleted from one thousand to less than three hundred in the course of a disease-ridden year... With these sorts of statistics it was as much a matter of simple logic as an act of desperation when they upped and left one night, bound on foot for their old hunting grounds, probably knowing full well that the cavalry would make them hurry, as they did, all the way... An epic in real life. Would the master epic-maker match it? In purely visual terms the answer was 'yes'. Ford vivid1y depicted the starvation and disease plaguing the Cheyenne trek... But somehow Ford never wholly got to the heart of the matter although the intent was there and at times this is a most impressive and moving film...Carroll Baker appears as a Quaker teacher who tries in vain to he1p the unfortunate migrants... Richard Widmark is the army captain who is as sympathetic as uniform allows, and Arthur Kennedy is razor-sharp in his impersonation of Doc Holliday, who, with Stewart's Earp, is drafted into leading a posse against the Indians...

The actual trek is an amazing story that probably came as quite a surprise to movie audiences in 1964, who had a hard time realizing just how cruel a treatment the Indians received.Ford and his screenwriter David Webb undoubtedly realized that an accurate portrayal of the events would not produce a commercial movie, so they took steps to make it more palatable to American audiences. The story is told largely through the viewpoint of cavalry officer Richard Widmark, who pursues (for the most part rather half-heartedly) the Indians. WIdmark is notably sympathetic toward the Indian cause and even manages to convert a gung-ho lieutenant played by Patrick Wayne (John Wayne's son). The closest person to a villain is a fort commander played by Karl Malden, who takes in some of the Indians for the winter, then locks them in a storeroom without any heat. Malden's character is a German-American who speaks with a thick accent and talks about having to obey orders, an obvious reference to the Nazis in World War II. It was thus easier for audiences to dismiss Malden's character as more German than &#34;real&#34; American.The revised story may have been a bit more palatable to 1964 audiences but it wasn't compelling cinema, not nearly as good a tale as the previous year's &#34;How the West Was Won&#34; (which also featured Malden, Widmark and co-star Carroll Baker). There's lots of long, dull stretches, much as in the actual march, but the film only hints at the harsh reality of the actual march, an actual depiction of which would have been too much for audiences of that era to accept. Actually casting native American actors in the major Indian speaking roles would also have been too much for the audience, so familiar, mostly Hispanic, actors like Ricardo Montalban and Sal Mineo got the roles.&#34;Cheyenne Autumn&#34; is a movie that can be best appreciated for various bits and pieces than as a finished product. The film makes exceptional use of Ford's favorite Monument Valley settings (even though the actual march occurred far from the valley). In addition, the acting is solid, with Widmark in one of his more accessible roles. Best of all is a completely incongruous 20-minute sequence set in Dodge City featuring James Stewart as a folksy, rascally, antiheroic Wyatt Earp trying to deal with the local hysteria surrounding the impending arrival of the Cheyenne while not allowing it to interrupt his poker game. Stewart, Arthur Kennedy (as Doc Holliday) and John Carradine (as a fellow gambler) are in fine form here, and it's one of Ford's best comic sequences, even if it clashes with the rest of the movie. Another plus on the DVD is a full-length commentary by a Ford biographer and film historian which provides details of making the film (including having to film scenes on the day of JFK's assassination) and Ford's lengthy career.&#34;Cheyenne Autumn&#34; has enough going for it for me to give it a marginal recommendation, even though the overall story fails to provide a proper presentation of the events depicted. Frankly, if it were made by any other director or had occurred earlier in John Ford's career, the movie would have been completely forgotten. However, as it stands, the movie serves as an interesting, albeit often unsuccessful, footnote to America's greatest Western director.",3,A Ford Farewell to the West,1400025600,"05 14, 2014",2014,4058,"['end', 'career', 'John', 'Ford', 'revisited', 'themes', 'earlier', 'Westerns', 'attempt', 'present', 'more', 'balanced', 'point-of-view', 'final', 'Western', '34', 'Cheyenne', 'Autumn', '34', 'tries', 'paint', 'more', 'accurate', 'picture', 'government', 'treatment', 'American', 'Indian', 'far', 'short', 'earlier', 'classics.', '34', 'Autumn', '34', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'tribe', 'Cheyenne', '1878', 'who', 'were', 'upset', 'harsh', 'treatment', 'Oklahoma', 'reservation', 'embarked', '1500-mile', 'hike', 'back', 'homeland', 'Montana', 'U.S.', 'army', 'following', 'occasionally', 'engaging', 'battle', 'never', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'marchers', 'who', 'included', 'large', 'numbers', 'women', 'old', 'people', 'children', 'actual', 'trek', 'amazing', 'story', 'probably', 'came', 'quite', 'surprise', 'movie', 'audiences', '1964', 'who', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'realizing', 'just', 'how', 'cruel', 'treatment', 'Indians', 'received.Ford', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Webb', 'undoubtedly', 'realized', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'events', 'would', 'not', 'produce', 'commercial', 'movie', 'took', 'steps', 'make', 'more', 'palatable', 'American', 'audiences', 'story', 'told', 'largely', 'viewpoint', 'cavalry', 'officer', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'who', 'most', 'part', 'rather', 'half-heartedly', 'Indians', 'WIdmark', 'notably', 'sympathetic', 'Indian', 'cause', 'even', 'manages', 'convert', 'gung-ho', 'lieutenant', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'John', 'Wayne', 'son', 'closest', 'person', 'villain', 'fort', 'commander', 'played', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'who', 'Indians', 'winter', 'then', 'storeroom', 'heat', 'Malden', 'character', 'German-American', 'who', 'thick', 'accent', 'talks', 'having', 'obey', 'orders', 'obvious', 'reference', 'Nazis', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'thus', 'easier', 'audiences', 'dismiss', 'Malden', 'character', 'more', 'German', '34', 'real', '34', 'American.The', 'revised', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'palatable', '1964', 'audiences', 'was', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'cinema', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'tale', 'previous', 'year', '34', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', '34', 'also', 'featured', 'Malden', 'Widmark', 'co-star', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'lots', 'long', 'dull', 'stretches', 'much', 'actual', 'march', 'film', 'only', 'harsh', 'reality', 'actual', 'march', 'actual', 'depiction', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'audiences', 'era', 'accept', 'Actually', 'casting', 'native', 'American', 'actors', 'major', 'Indian', 'speaking', 'roles', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'audience', 'so', 'familiar', 'mostly', 'Hispanic', 'actors', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'got', 'roles.', '34', 'Cheyenne', 'Autumn', '34', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'appreciated', 'various', 'bits', 'pieces', 'finished', 'product', 'film', 'exceptional', 'use', 'Ford', 'favorite', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'settings', 'even', 'actual', 'march', 'occurred', 'far', 'valley', 'addition', 'acting', 'solid', 'Widmark', 'one', 'more', 'accessible', 'roles', 'Best', 'completely', 'incongruous', '20-minute', 'sequence', 'set', 'Dodge', 'City', 'featuring', 'James', 'Stewart', 'folksy', 'rascally', 'antiheroic', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'trying', 'deal', 'local', 'hysteria', 'surrounding', 'impending', 'arrival', 'Cheyenne', 'not', 'allowing', 'interrupt', 'poker', 'game', 'Stewart', 'Arthur', 'Kennedy', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'John', 'Carradine', 'fellow', 'gambler', 'are', 'fine', 'form', 'here', 'one', 'Ford', 'best', 'comic', 'sequences', 'even', 'rest', 'movie', 'plus', 'DVD', 'full-length', 'commentary', 'Ford', 'biographer', 'film', 'historian', 'details', 'making', 'film', 'including', 'having', 'film', 'scenes', 'day', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'Ford', 'lengthy', 'career.', '34', 'Cheyenne', 'Autumn', '34', 'enough', 'going', 'give', 'marginal', 'recommendation', 'even', 'overall', 'story', 'fails', 'provide', 'proper', 'presentation', 'events', 'depicted', 'Frankly', 'were', 'made', 'other', 'director', 'had', 'occurred', 'earlier', 'John', 'Ford', 'career', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'However', 'movie', 'interesting', 'albeit', 'often', 'unsuccessful', 'footnote', 'America', 'greatest', 'Western', 'director']",N/A
313025,AK61LQI92GTCH,6302450179,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[8, 14]","Report card for CHEYENNE AUTUMN, John Ford's epic retelling of the Cheyenne Trail of Tears, an 1878 exodus of over 300 men, women, and children off their barren Oklahoma reservation 1,500 miles north to the Black Hills of Dakota.Acting.  *** (3 stars out of five.)  It's hard to know exactly who to point the finger at, but a finger has to be pointed at someone.  Richard Widmark stars as the cavalry officer who spends most of the movie chasing the fleeing Cheyenne, and he's very good as the hard driving, ambivalent army officer.  Even Carroll Baker as a Quaker schoolteacher and Mike Mazurki as the troop's top sergeant are given some nice scenes.  The problem lies with the casting of the Cheyennes.  Ricardo Montalban and Gilbert Roland play Little Wolf and Dull Knife, two real life characters who led the Cheyenne in their dangerous flight.  Sal Mineo, of all people, plays Little Wolf's son Red Shirt.  Montalban and Roland are both proven commodities - good actors, too - but they weren't Native Americans (in fact, both were from Mexico - Mineo was an Italian-American who hailed from Brooklyn.)  They aren't the first actors covered in greasepaint to play characters of another race, and that isn't the biggest problem, anyway, although casting a non-Native American in those roles probably wouldn't even be attempted today.  The problem lies with Ford's approach to the Cheyenne, which can probably best be characterized as solemn and dignified.  The intention is laudable, but the execution leaves a huge hole in their movie.  Montalban and Roland come off as stiff and wooden and lacquered, and the movie is crippled by it.  Even when they're in scenes alone with each other they're forced to say stuff like `My brother!  We have always thought as one.  Not even a straw has come between us!'  If Ford had drawn up just one scene that allowed Little Wolf and Dull Knife to let the starch out of their spine long enough to say something like`I don't know if we're gonna make `er, Little Wolf,' -in other words, be identifiably human for a couple hundred feet of celluloid - they would have locked us in with them.  But he didn't, and they don't.Pacing. **.  Ye gods preserve me from movies that are so long they need an `Intermission Entr `Acte' in the middle of them.  CHEYENNE AUTUMN clocks in at a morbidly obese 154-minutes, 2-1/2 hours, and like most marathon epics it tends to flow unevenly.  The likeliest candidate for liposuction is the Dodge City scene that occurs right before the intermission.  Jimmy Stewart and Arthur Kennedy play Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, two participants in a hastily formed posse/citizen army created to intercept the Cheyenne in their flight.  It's a fairly long, almost slapstick interlude that would only make sense if we were emotionally engaged with the Cheyenne and needed comedy to relieve the gloom.  But Ford doesn't come close to getting under the skin of either Little Wolf or Dull Knife, and of the Cheyenne we remain distant, detached observers.  For what it's worth, Stewart made no less convincing a Wyatt Earp than Mineo a Red Shirt.Photography.  *****.  Breathtaking and stunning are the first words that come to mind, followed by beautiful and sublime.  Ford was a visual artist of the highest caliber, and CHEYENNE AUTUMN doesn't disappoint on that score.  You can freeze the image at just about any point in the movie and you'll get a beautifully composed still picture.  It helps that this, Ford's last western, was shot in his beloved Monument Valley.  It doesn't hurt that his Cheyenne take three-quarters of the movie getting out of that small patch of territory, either.CHEYENNE AUTUMN is a mixed bag, worth a recommendation with reservations.

313026,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6302450179,Trevor Willsmer,"[5, 5]","Common wisdom has it that Cheyenne Autumn is a well-intentioned failure, and while his last Western is certainly far from John Ford's best, it is one of those films that becomes more impressive on repeated viewings. Although seen by many as an apologist epic made as an act of contrition by Ford for so many decades of stereotyping Native Americans, he always denied this, and it has to be said that, Two Rode Together apart, his Westerns generally had a bit more respect for the various tribes than his contemporaries. Instead its appeal seems partially as a good yarn, albeit one compromised by budgetary concerns, and one of his sporadic shots at an important message picture with a social conscience. Although it's not an unqualified success, his often spectacular retelling of the Cheyenne tribe's epic trek from their rundown reservation back to their original homeland has a lot to recommend it. While it's hard today to see the main Cheyenne characters played by the likes of Sal Mineo and a predominantly Latin-American cast - Ricardo Montalban, Dolores Del Rio and Gilbert Roland among them - and have most of the film seen through the eyes of white characters like Richard Widmark's conflicted cavalry officer, Carroll Baker's school ma'am and many familiar faces from the Ford stock company (including a surprisingly unbilled Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr in virtual reprises of their Rio Grande roles), it was a major achievement at the time to even tell a story about the callous treatment of the Native American tribes: feelbad epics had never been a good bet at the box-office.Certainly at times you get the feeling that Warner Bros. were trying to save money wherever possible. Many of the more dramatic incidents of the real trek were cut from the script to save money, one key section is obviously shot on a soundstage rather than on location and there is some crude backprojection at the end (perhaps necessitated by having to replace Spencer Tracey with Edward G. Robinson), often leaving the film looking rather disjointed. The biggest misstep is the Dodge City sequence, which was Ford's idea of a comic relief intermission. While mildly amusing, it's a massive shift of tone that adds nothing to the story aside from an opportunity to add a little starpower with James Stewart's comical Wyatt Earp and cronies Arthur Kennedy and John Carradine and which could easily be removed from the film entirely without anyone noticing (indeed, it was cut from many prints after the film opened to get more shows in). Nonetheless, there are still many powerful sequences, from the Cheyenne standing all day in the baking sun to welcome a Senate Committee that can't be bothered to travel the dusty road to the reservation to a prolonged episode in a fort when Karl Malden's self-aggrandizing and ambitious commander sees them more as an opportunity than as starving and freezing human beings. There's certainly much to like, from William H. Clothier's fine widescreen photography of Monument Valley (this would be Ford's last film in his favorite location), a good score from Alex North and a nicely underplayed proposal scene in a schoolhouse. If it never quite gels, it's still a noble attempt at popularising difficult subject matter.Warners 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is the fully restored version of the film, including a vintage 20-minute documentary on the real trek, the theatrical trailer and an often amusing audio commentary by Ford biographer Joseph McBride - apparently the extras can often be heard swearing in their own language secure in the knowledge that none of the crew had a clue what they were really saying!",3,Not the disaster it's often painted,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,3639,"['Common', 'wisdom', 'Cheyenne', 'Autumn', 'well-intentioned', 'failure', 'last', 'Western', 'certainly', 'far', 'John', 'Ford', 'best', 'one', 'films', 'more', 'impressive', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'seen', 'many', 'apologist', 'epic', 'made', 'act', 'contrition', 'Ford', 'so', 'many', 'decades', 'stereotyping', 'Native', 'Americans', 'always', 'denied', 'be', 'said', 'Two', 'Rode', 'Together', 'apart', 'Westerns', 'generally', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'respect', 'various', 'tribes', 'contemporaries', 'Instead', 'appeal', 'partially', 'good', 'yarn', 'one', 'compromised', 'budgetary', 'concerns', 'one', 'sporadic', 'shots', 'important', 'message', 'picture', 'social', 'conscience', 'not', 'unqualified', 'success', 'often', 'spectacular', 'retelling', 'Cheyenne', 'tribe', 'epic', 'trek', 'rundown', 'reservation', 'back', 'original', 'homeland', 'lot', 'recommend', 'hard', 'today', 'see', 'main', 'Cheyenne', 'characters', 'played', 'likes', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'predominantly', 'Latin-American', 'cast', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'Dolores', 'Del', 'Rio', 'Gilbert', 'Roland', 'have', 'most', 'film', 'seen', 'eyes', 'white', 'characters', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'conflicted', 'cavalry', 'officer', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'school', ""ma'am"", 'many', 'familiar', 'Ford', 'stock', 'company', 'including', 'surprisingly', 'unbilled', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr', 'virtual', 'reprises', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'roles', 'was', 'major', 'achievement', 'time', 'even', 'tell', 'story', 'callous', 'treatment', 'Native', 'American', 'tribes', 'feelbad', 'epics', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'good', 'bet', 'box-office.Certainly', 'times', 'get', 'feeling', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'were', 'trying', 'save', 'money', 'possible', 'Many', 'more', 'dramatic', 'incidents', 'real', 'trek', 'were', 'cut', 'script', 'save', 'money', 'one', 'key', 'section', 'obviously', 'shot', 'soundstage', 'rather', 'location', 'crude', 'backprojection', 'end', 'perhaps', 'necessitated', 'having', 'replace', 'Spencer', 'Tracey', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'often', 'leaving', 'film', 'looking', 'rather', 'disjointed', 'biggest', 'misstep', 'Dodge', 'City', 'sequence', 'was', 'Ford', 'idea', 'comic', 'relief', 'intermission', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'massive', 'shift', 'tone', 'nothing', 'story', 'aside', 'opportunity', 'add', 'little', 'starpower', 'James', 'Stewart', 'comical', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'cronies', 'Arthur', 'Kennedy', 'John', 'Carradine', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'removed', 'film', 'entirely', 'anyone', 'noticing', 'indeed', 'was', 'cut', 'many', 'prints', 'film', 'opened', 'get', 'more', 'shows', 'Nonetheless', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'powerful', 'sequences', 'Cheyenne', 'standing', 'day', 'baking', 'sun', 'welcome', 'Senate', 'Committee', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'travel', 'dusty', 'road', 'reservation', 'prolonged', 'episode', 'fort', 'when', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'self-aggrandizing', 'ambitious', 'commander', 'more', 'opportunity', 'starving', 'freezing', 'human', 'beings', 'certainly', 'much', 'like', 'William', 'H.', 'Clothier', 'fine', 'widescreen', 'photography', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'would', 'be', 'Ford', 'last', 'film', 'favorite', 'location', 'good', 'score', 'Alex', 'North', 'nicely', 'underplayed', 'proposal', 'scene', 'schoolhouse', 'never', 'quite', 'gels', 'still', 'noble', 'attempt', 'popularising', 'difficult', 'subject', 'matter.Warners', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'fully', 'restored', 'version', 'film', 'including', 'vintage', '20-minute', 'documentary', 'real', 'trek', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'often', 'amusing', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Ford', 'biographer', 'Joseph', 'McBride', 'apparently', 'extras', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'heard', 'swearing', 'own', 'language', 'secure', 'knowledge', 'none', 'crew', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'were', 'really', 'saying']",N/A
