I am a new viewer and have only been watching since my little one was just a few weeks old (she's now 20 Months).  Now, that I've seen most of the show's reruns, I have purchased the movie - I was a little dissapointed to discover Harvey and the Aunts were not played by the same actors in the episodes, but otherwise, it was a wonderfully done movie and I am thrilled to add it to my collection of DVDs!  Now all we need is the release of Sabrina's 7 seasons on DVD to make it even better! :)",5,Different than the Episodes but still a great movie!,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,531,"['baby', 'daughter', 'love', 'Sabrina', 'am', 'new', 'viewer', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'watching', 'little', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'few', 'weeks', 'old', 'now', '20', 'Months', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'show', 'reruns', 'have', 'purchased', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'dissapointed', 'discover', 'Harvey', 'Aunts', 'were', 'not', 'played', 'same', 'actors', 'episodes', 'otherwise', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'movie', 'am', 'thrilled', 'add', 'collection', 'DVDs', 'Now', 'need', 'release', 'Sabrina', '7', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'make', 'even', 'better']",Sabrina the Teenage Witch VHS

All she had done were small things and Nickelodian's Clarissa Explains It All. The movie is based on the character that appears in Archie Comics. It was made as a Shotime original movie, but spawned a hit t.v. series.Sabrina Spellman's parents have gone on a trip far away and have left her withe her two aunts, Hilda and Zelda (Not played by the same people on the show). She has a hard time fitting in. On her 16th birthday, her aunts explain to her that she is a witch. She tries to use her magical powers to make the most popular boy in school fall in love with her, but the concequences could be deadly. What she dosen't see is that her friend Harvey(not played by the same guy on the show) loves her. Now she has to make the right choices or she will be doomed forever. It's funny but not as funny as the show. For one thing, the voice of Salem is different. This movie is really good despite the changes.

The movie is a little less lighthearted, but has more emotional depth.  The relationship between Sabrina and Harvey is explored in a more satisfying way.

This movie preceded the TV series, and comes off as more of a light teen drama. An altogether different tone.
