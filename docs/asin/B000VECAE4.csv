1101239,A4O0L1OAJM6I2,B000VECAE4,C. Lockwood,"[75, 86]","Now this what I call a sitcom! King Of Queens is in my opinion the greatest television comedy of all time, that is correct the greatest of all time.Set in Queens, NY is an all star cast featuring Kevin James as Doug Heffernan, an overweight IPS driver, that is pretty much the all american fat guy. He eats alot, drinks, is obsessed with sports, watches alot of tv, makes farting noises with his hand, and oh did I mention he eats alot. Also starring Leah Remini as Carrie Heffernan, the outspoken, strong, and alot of times mean, beautiful wife of Doug. And last but not least Jerry Stiller as Arthur Spooner, the outrageous father-in-law that lives in Doug and Carries basement after setting fire to his house, trying to cook on an old hot plate. The three of these actors are a dynamic trio, that without anyone of these characters the show would not have turned out as funny as it did. I have to say that every character created in King Of Queens is funny, I have tried to think of one that maybe I did not quite like, but after thinking long and hard I love them all, from the quirky dog walker starring Nicole Sullivan as Holly Shumpert that Doug and Carrie hire to walk their father, to the mean waitress Doug almost fought with but ends up trying to run away scared. I have watched alot of sitcoms, and have yet to find one that comes close to the King Of Queens. I now use the ignorant word ""Shutty"" instead of shut up or be quite. I feel that it's nicer than using ""shut up"", and not quite as nice as ""be quite"". Even after watching each episode atleast five times, they are all still as funny as the first time I watched them.This is for anyone who loves over the top funny comedy. That can appreciate the greatness tv sometimes has to offer. Although all the episodes are hilarious, it also brings us back to reality with some very powerful and meaningful moments. The very last episode had me cracking up, but also in tears.

1101242,A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B000VECAE4,D. Allen,"[6, 10]","Honestly, I can't explain what I like about King of Queens. I find the show hilarious despite the fact that I rarely watch sitcoms on television. Perhaps I'm seeing something in my life portrayed in the antics of Doug, his wife Carrie, and Carrie's father Arthur. Whatever the reason, I find King of Queens to be a real gem in this modern world where ""reality TV"" shows are the norm. It is refreshing to sit down and have an honest, laugh out loud comedy based on a married couple trying to make it in life.One of my favorite episodes was when Doug rented an apartment without Carrie's knowledge. By the very end, I'm wiping away tears from laughing so hard. My stomach started to hurt, actually.If I had to say one bad thing about the show, it would have to be the fact that in nearly every episode takes place in Doug and Carrie's house. A large percentage of episodes take place in either their kitchen, living room, or garage. It's a minor flaw to the show since even though the scenery differs slightly every episode is full of value and laughter. Also, another slight annoyance is the outside shot of the house. The exterior shot of the house is inconsistence with the interior shot. A good example is the location of the living room - the interior shows it to be on the right of the front door, whereas on the exterior it shows that to the right, there is nothing.I do not own individual seasons of the show. I received all nine seasons as a gift. I was surprised by the packaging though. All of the seasons are packed in a unique box to appear like an IPS delivery truck - a fictional delivery company where Doug is employed. I am pleased with the dvds. I am happy that the show was made into dvds. I must say that based on the cost of individual seasons, I recommend buying the entire box set to save some cash. One minor complaint about the dvds is the windows installer they pack on some seasons. If you like watching dvds on your computer, you might find it a bit annoying that the autorun asks you for installers (I noticed this on season two or three, I forgot which one). I find it annoying that I have to manually open my dvd application in order to view the show and close the popup for the installer. Most of them are pure dvds, so popping them on the computer will not ask you install a dvd player.",4,A rare comedy,1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,2317,"['Honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'what', 'like', 'King', 'Queens', 'find', 'show', 'hilarious', 'fact', 'rarely', 'watch', 'sitcoms', 'television', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'something', 'life', 'portrayed', 'antics', 'Doug', 'wife', 'Carrie', 'Carrie', 'father', 'Arthur', 'reason', 'find', 'King', 'Queens', 'be', 'real', 'gem', 'modern', 'world', 'where', 'reality', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'norm', 'refreshing', 'sit', 'down', 'have', 'honest', 'loud', 'comedy', 'based', 'married', 'couple', 'trying', 'make', 'life.One', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'was', 'when', 'Doug', 'rented', 'apartment', 'Carrie', 'knowledge', 'very', 'end', ""'m"", 'wiping', 'away', 'tears', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'stomach', 'started', 'hurt', 'actually.If', 'had', 'say', 'one', 'bad', 'thing', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'fact', 'nearly', 'episode', 'place', 'Doug', 'Carrie', 'house', 'large', 'percentage', 'episodes', 'take', 'place', 'kitchen', 'living', 'room', 'garage', 'minor', 'flaw', 'show', 'even', 'scenery', 'differs', 'slightly', 'episode', 'full', 'value', 'laughter', 'Also', 'slight', 'annoyance', 'outside', 'shot', 'house', 'exterior', 'shot', 'house', 'inconsistence', 'interior', 'shot', 'good', 'example', 'location', 'living', 'room', 'interior', 'be', 'right', 'front', 'door', 'whereas', 'exterior', 'right', 'nothing.I', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'individual', 'seasons', 'show', 'received', 'nine', 'seasons', 'gift', 'was', 'surprised', 'packaging', 'seasons', 'are', 'packed', 'unique', 'box', 'appear', 'IPS', 'delivery', 'truck', 'fictional', 'delivery', 'company', 'where', 'Doug', 'employed', 'am', 'pleased', 'dvds', 'am', 'happy', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'dvds', 'must', 'say', 'based', 'cost', 'individual', 'seasons', 'recommend', 'buying', 'entire', 'box', 'set', 'save', 'cash', 'One', 'minor', 'complaint', 'dvds', 'windows', 'installer', 'pack', 'seasons', 'like', 'watching', 'dvds', 'computer', 'might', 'find', 'bit', 'annoying', 'autorun', 'installers', 'noticed', 'season', 'two', 'three', 'forgot', 'one', 'find', 'annoying', 'have', 'manually', 'open', 'dvd', 'application', 'order', 'view', 'show', 'close', 'popup', 'installer', 'Most', 'are', 'pure', 'dvds', 'popping', 'computer', 'will', 'not', 'ask', 'install', 'dvd', 'player']",The King of Queens: The Complete Series

Did it get old? No. It only got funnier.I admit I bought this series mostly because it was for just $22.99 but what a bargain even at the normal price. I never once watched this series when it was on and now I'm sad I missed it. It is a genuinely laugh out loud comedy. It doesn't pretend to be anything deeper than that, even though at times it does go deeper and scores on drama. But, smartly, it never hangs out there very long. This is not MASH where the drama eventually overpowered the comedy and, to me, the entertainment value.King of Queens goes for laughs and it succeeds. Kevin James is perfect as the everyman who says and does all the things we all wish we could. He loves his football, pizza and beer. His wife mostly plays the straight 'man' but Leah Remini is also outstanding throughout. She is an unusual mixture of model looks with a NY attitude.The supporting cast is hit or miss for the first few seasons as they find their places later on but of course it was a stroke of genius to have Jerry Stiller cast as Leah Remini's father.

Szilagy ""Joe Szilagy""","[3, 3]","Well, first off, let me just say that I've only watched the first two episodes from Season one, and (contrary to some of the negative reviews), the picture was fine! Mind you, it may not have been quite as sharp as some of the finest quality DVDs I have, but then again, I'm not so sure I would have even noticed any (slight) lack of quality, if I hadn't read those particular reviews!But really, for $33.33 (when it's on sale here) for almost 76 hours of one of the funniest and wittiest comedies in television history, with decent video and sound quality- it's difficult to complain! But there is a solution to the one problem that pretty much everyone seems to agree on- the now infamous: 'two spindles'!But before I forget, I also wanted to mention that every single disc is in great condition, and there are no duplicates, etc.Now, about those 'spindles'.....I can fully understand why people would be irked at having to constantly remove and replace several DVDs on two separate spindles (my plastic cases came unglued as soon as I opened the box, though, luckily, the discs stayed on the spindles!), just to search for one particular disc!However, before even ordering this set, I remembered that I had bought a bulk package of thin, clear, double DVD slim cases years ago from Best Buy or somewhere for about $10, which I hadn't even opened! So, upon opening the box set, I started examining, then placing each disc in the cases (two discs per case). I managed to fit eleven of the slim double cases snuggly in the box, though ten is a little more comfortable, with the remaining four cases containing the remaining DVDs, outside, and beside the box. So there! No problem! Don't have to rummage through the two piles! Try Best Buy, or here on Amazon (just checked- they do have them), and get a package of slim DVD cases. You'll be glad you did!P.S. I've included a photo of how nicely the discs fit into the original box, in the slim cases.

In the role of the smarter, wise-cracking spouse is LEAH REMINI, updated in this case to be as venomous as she is voluptuous. Astutely cast in the ""wacky neighbor"" role is the showbiz veteran's veteran JERRY STILLER, as Doug's cellar-dwelling father-in-law with a COSMO KRAMER-esque scheme for anybody who will lend an ear. Stiller's brilliantly wacked-out ARTHUR SPOONER is an even more twisted, indescribably annoying, (and even funnier) variation on his FRANK COSTANZA character from SEINFELD. JAMES lets the food/fat jokes fly with alarming regularity, CARRIE HEFFERNAN is the most despicable/lovable female creation since ELAINE BENNIS (Seinfeld again), and a book of Arthur's off the wall quotes would set the moral majority on its keister...with laughter, most likely.

Now this is a big deal in my house, because English is not my wife's first language. And I've come to love subititles, because they're great for watching stuff with volume low after kids have gone to bed. I'm so used to them now that shows and movies seem weird without them.But not to worry, because they have Closed Captioning. At least, I thought they did. And they do, except that I discovered an uncomfortable truth: HDMI cables don't transmit Closed Captions.It seems that there's no industry standard for HDMI to transmit Closed Captioning, so for the most part, CC doesn't work through HDMI. I tested this with my LG Blu-Ray player and HDTV, and found it to be true.Undaunted, I dug through a bunch of old wires in my closet, rigged them up behind my TV, and found a solution. Here's what to do to get those pesky Captions to work:1. Run old-school A/V cables (the red, white, and yellow) from your Blu-Ray player to your TV. I used an A/V switch as well, since I'm sharing that imput with a Wii.2. Temporarily disconnect your HDMI cable from the Blu-Ray player, so the TV won't recognize that input.3. On the TV, select A/V as the input. Then go into the settings and turn the captions on. And Voila! Closed Captions.Then when you're ready to use the HDMI again, just plug the HDMI cable back into the blu-ray player, select that input, and you're good to go.I was very happy to get those working again. The captions don't show the theme song though, so I'll just have to sing that out loud:""My eyes are gettin' weary, my back is gettin' tight!...""P.S. These do come in cheap packaging, stacked on spindles just like everybody says. If that bothers you, do like I did and buy a cheap CD/DVD case to put these in.

1101310,A3IVSZ4T1Q36UE,B000VECAE4,travis,"[237, 246]","Ok, I personally have owned all 9 seasons individually and then the complete series which is a wonderfully made IPS Truck in which the back holds (9) 3 disc tiny little box sets.  Each one has a small picture of what the cover of the original 9 season box sets look like.  To clarify each season of these tiny box sets match the front cover of the same season that was put out originally.  In the front of the IPS truck (under the hood) there is a episode guide for each season.  Here is a link to that set.  Check the pictures for the design, the individual tiny box sets, etc.http://www.amazon.com/King-Queens-Complete-Kevin-James/dp/B000VECAE4/ref=sr_1_3?s=movies-tv&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1343634996&sr;=1-3&keywords;=king+of+queensNOW, when I seen this new 40.00 set come out I was like how come so cheap?  Just look at the pictures... it is ok packaging and its the same discs you will find in other complete set or the original 9 box sets but the discs come on 2 separate spindles.  Could cause damage to the discs over time if you move it around a lot.  Spindles aren't the best for storing discs.So basically, if you are a hard core fan I would recommend the 120.00 really nice IPS Truck Set.  Few complete series are as creative and nicely done as it is.  If you are new fan trying out the show or don't really care about how it comes then save the 80.00 and go with the 40.00 set with the spindles inside.Just wanted to warn people so they aren't upset with the packaging of the 40.00 set and know what to expect.  BOTTOM LINE: Look at all the pictures for both versions before deciding.Edit: Amazon shouldn't have combined the reviews.  That's why there are reviews for the IPS Truck 150.00 set and they are under the 40.00 set reviews and vice versa.  They should have been separate.  I can see why people were confused on what set they are getting.",5,"Be Careful with $40.00 Set - Know What You Are Buying - *IPS Truck=$120-$150 Set, $40Set=Square Box w/ Spindles Holding Discs",1318377600,"10 12, 2011",2011,1853,"['Ok', 'personally', 'have', 'owned', '9', 'seasons', 'individually', 'then', 'complete', 'series', 'wonderfully', 'made', 'IPS', 'Truck', 'back', '9', '3', 'disc', 'tiny', 'little', 'box', 'sets', 'one', 'small', 'picture', 'what', 'cover', 'original', '9', 'season', 'box', 'sets', 'look', 'clarify', 'season', 'tiny', 'box', 'sets', 'match', 'front', 'cover', 'same', 'season', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'originally', 'front', 'IPS', 'truck', 'hood', 'episode', 'guide', 'season', 'Here', 'link', 'set', 'Check', 'pictures', 'design', 'individual', 'tiny', 'box', 'sets', 'etc.http', '//www.amazon.com/King-Queens-Complete-Kevin-James/dp/B000VECAE4/ref=sr_1_3', 's=movies-tv', 'ie', '=UTF8', 'qid', '=1343634996', 'sr', '=1-3', 'keywords', '=king+of+queensNOW', 'when', 'seen', 'new', '40.00', 'set', 'come', 'out', 'was', 'how', 'come', 'so', 'cheap', 'Just', 'look', 'pictures', 'ok', 'packaging', 'same', 'discs', 'will', 'find', 'other', 'complete', 'set', 'original', '9', 'box', 'sets', 'discs', 'come', '2', 'separate', 'spindles', 'Could', 'cause', 'damage', 'discs', 'time', 'move', 'lot', 'Spindles', 'are', ""n't"", 'best', 'storing', 'discs.So', 'basically', 'are', 'hard', 'core', 'fan', 'would', 'recommend', '120.00', 'really', 'nice', 'IPS', 'Truck', 'Set', 'Few', 'complete', 'series', 'are', 'creative', 'nicely', 'done', 'are', 'new', 'fan', 'trying', 'out', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'how', 'then', 'save', '80.00', 'go', '40.00', 'set', 'spindles', 'inside.Just', 'wanted', 'warn', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'upset', 'packaging', '40.00', 'set', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Look', 'pictures', 'versions', 'deciding.Edit', 'Amazon', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'combined', 'reviews', 'why', 'are', 'reviews', 'IPS', 'Truck', '150.00', 'set', 'are', '40.00', 'set', 'reviews', 'vice', 'versa', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'separate', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'were', 'confused', 'what', 'set', 'are', 'getting']",The King of Queens: The Complete Series
