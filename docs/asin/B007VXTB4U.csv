He then kills the person his girlfriend identifies as the rapist (shown only in bits and pieces as a flashback).He is sentenced to a mental institution.  The rest of the film shows his interaction with the staff and fellow inmates and we learn more about Nick's issues through flashbacks of his childhood.It this movie is intended to be a realistic drama, it fails miserably.  There are a few interesting moments but it feels more like a PG-13/made for television movie that attempts to show the difficulties of lasting guilt.If you're hoping for a realistic story of what life might be like in a mental institution for violent criminals (like I was) you will likely be disappointed.",1,Ugh,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,758,"['POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERSNick', 'Stahl', 'girlfriend', 'supposedly', 'raped', 'not', 'shown', 'then', 'person', 'girlfriend', 'identifies', 'rapist', 'shown', 'only', 'bits', 'pieces', 'flashback', '.He', 'sentenced', 'mental', 'institution', 'rest', 'film', 'interaction', 'staff', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'learn', 'more', 'Nick', 'issues', 'flashbacks', 'childhood.It', 'movie', 'intended', 'be', 'realistic', 'drama', 'miserably', 'are', 'few', 'interesting', 'moments', 'more', 'PG-13/made', 'television', 'movie', 'show', 'difficulties', 'lasting', 'guilt.If', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'realistic', 'story', 'what', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'mental', 'institution', 'violent', 'criminals', 'was', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

The actors do a convincing job with the characters that they play, and the plot does lead up to an unforeseen conclusion.  Nick Stahl was the child actor who played beside Mel Gibson in the film: &#34;The Man Without a Face.&#34;  It's a good movie to pop into your DVD player on a rainy afternoon.

1538969,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B007VXTB4U,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","It's always nice to start with the positive. I like the way ""On the Inside"" attempts to realistically but sensitively show an institution for the criminally insane without trying to shock or rub its awfulness in the audience's face. The acting by all is quite good, often superb. Shohreh Aghdashloo of ""House of Sand and Fog"" fame particularly shines as Dr. Lofton, though, alas, like most of the central cast, we aren't shown enough of her character to really appreciate it. That's the biggest problem here: The creators were dealing with too many characters for a film of this length, and they tried to show/tell all their basic stories when there simply wasn't time for that.We meet Allen (both as a child and in adulthood), the decent, intelligent fellow who is institutionalized more because of tragic circumstances and some horrible choices he made than because he is truly criminal; Lisa, the ""manic depressive"" female prisoner with whom Allen begins an affair, and who, like Allen, seems a bit too painfully normal; Carl, the ultra-psychotic, apparently irredeemable inmate; several other prisoners; several compassionate guards and psychiatrists who are there out of a ""belief in reformation"" and an honest desire to relieve human suffering; and several other miscellaneous people, including the father of Allen's victim. The good acting keeps them from being the usual stock ""prison flick"" characters, but again, it's just too much for one film to handle.""On the Inside"" attempts to make a statement about the essential loneliness of all humanity, a statement that its fragmentary plot keeps from being completely made. The whole theme of forgiveness is also important, yet, it too is never really fleshed-out. The film keeps promising to take you somewhere, but never arrives in the end.",3,Loose Threads of Several Promising Stories that Just Don't Tie Together,1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,1798,"['always', 'nice', 'start', 'positive', 'way', 'Inside', 'attempts', 'realistically', 'sensitively', 'show', 'institution', 'criminally', 'insane', 'trying', 'shock', 'rub', 'awfulness', 'audience', 'face', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'often', 'superb', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'fame', 'particularly', 'shines', 'Dr.', 'Lofton', 'though', 'alas', 'most', 'central', 'cast', 'are', ""n't"", 'shown', 'enough', 'character', 'really', 'appreciate', 'biggest', 'problem', 'here', 'creators', 'were', 'dealing', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'length', 'tried', 'show/tell', 'basic', 'stories', 'when', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'time', 'that.We', 'meet', 'Allen', 'child', 'adulthood', 'decent', 'intelligent', 'fellow', 'who', 'institutionalized', 'more', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'horrible', 'choices', 'made', 'truly', 'criminal', 'Lisa', 'manic', 'depressive', 'female', 'prisoner', 'whom', 'Allen', 'affair', 'who', 'Allen', 'bit', 'too', 'painfully', 'normal', 'Carl', 'ultra-psychotic', 'apparently', 'irredeemable', 'inmate', 'several', 'other', 'prisoners', 'several', 'compassionate', 'guards', 'psychiatrists', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'belief', 'reformation', 'honest', 'desire', 'relieve', 'human', 'suffering', 'several', 'other', 'miscellaneous', 'people', 'including', 'father', 'Allen', 'victim', 'good', 'acting', 'keeps', 'being', 'usual', 'stock', 'prison', 'flick', 'characters', 'again', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'film', 'handle', 'Inside', 'make', 'statement', 'essential', 'loneliness', 'humanity', 'statement', 'fragmentary', 'plot', 'keeps', 'being', 'completely', 'made', 'whole', 'theme', 'forgiveness', 'also', 'important', 'yet', 'too', 'never', 'really', 'fleshed-out', 'film', 'promising', 'take', 'somewhere', 'never', 'end']",N/A
1538970,A17LEYMZI8OYOQ,B007VXTB4U,"Michael B. Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[8, 10]","ON THE INSIDE may have some problems, but overall it is a pretty good thriller that boasts some excellent performances and many well-written scenes, one of which should have you jumping out of your seat.  It did me.Evoking memories of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, albeit without the humor and a much more modest budget, writer-director D.W. Brown's film tells of a decent, but troubled young man (Nick Stahl), who is sent to a psychiatric institution for the criminally insane, only to find himself trapped when another inmate (Dash Mihok), a sociopath, leads a deadly escape attempt.Olivia Wilde and Pruitt Taylor Vince, as well as Stahl and Mihok, are quite impressive in their roles, yet the one major disappointment in this picture is the performance delivered by one-time Oscar nominee Shohreh Aghdashloo, ordinarily a very fine actress.  In all fairness to Ms. Aghdashloo, her role as the head of the psychiatric facility is poorly conceived and written.  She was unable to breathe any life into this cardboard character, nor was director Brown able to help her.  Thankfully, her screen time in this otherwise entertaining movie is minimal.Anchor Bay Entertainment has released ON THE INSIDE in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack. Michael B.

1538972,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B007VXTB4U,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","Art professor Allen Meneric (Nick Stahl) is being evaluated at a mental institution for criminals. He brutally murdered a man who he thought raped his girlfriend, with the irony of it being the wrong man. While in prison he has flashbacks to his childhood to let us know he has other issues as his mom's number two son.In prison Allen meets Ben Marshall played by a Toj Johnson looking Pruitt Taylor Vince. He has a wonderful character, whose crime we don't find out until the end. He provides the production with some good dry humor during the early slow character build up. Lines such as: ""I have friends, Bob and Isaac. I can't really count Isaac because only Bob can see him.""Eventually Allen gets moved to minimum security where he meets the bipolar Mia (Olivia Wilde) whose character subplot was weak. The film eventually transforms from a smart psychological drama to an action film that doesn't quite make it. Good acting. Sharp dialouge. But the ending didn't bring it home.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, no nudity.This is another film shot in Pittsburgh which due to its financial incentives, infrastructure, and skilled locals is becoming the ""Hollywood"" of the east.",3,IT IS NICE TALKING TO ME,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,1176,"['Art', 'professor', 'Allen', 'Meneric', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'being', 'evaluated', 'mental', 'institution', 'criminals', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'man', 'who', 'thought', 'raped', 'girlfriend', 'irony', 'being', 'wrong', 'man', 'prison', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'let', 'know', 'other', 'issues', 'mom', 'number', 'two', 'son.In', 'prison', 'Allen', 'Ben', 'Marshall', 'played', 'Toj', 'Johnson', 'looking', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'wonderful', 'character', 'crime', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'end', 'production', 'good', 'dry', 'humor', 'early', 'slow', 'character', 'build', 'up', 'Lines', 'such', 'have', 'friends', 'Bob', 'Isaac', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'count', 'Isaac', 'only', 'Bob', 'can', 'see', 'Eventually', 'Allen', 'moved', 'minimum', 'security', 'where', 'bipolar', 'Mia', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'character', 'subplot', 'was', 'weak', 'film', 'eventually', 'smart', 'psychological', 'drama', 'action', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'Good', 'acting', 'Sharp', 'dialouge', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'home.PARENTAL', 'GUIDE', 'F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity.This', 'film', 'shot', 'Pittsburgh', 'due', 'financial', 'incentives', 'infrastructure', 'skilled', 'locals', 'becoming', 'Hollywood', 'east']",N/A
