But the added ""extra"" is, in my opinion, the ESSENCE of Thich Nhat Hanh.The biographical main feature is engaging - even beautiful.  But what would you rather see, the biography of a famous painter, or the paintings themselves?  The biography of a famous football player, or the actual film clips of the player in action?  The biography of a famous Buddhist monk, or the actual words of the monk as he describes his practice and teaches us how to incorporate compassion in our everyday lives?I watched the main feature many times and certainly benefited from it.  But the ""extra"" is more than beautiful - it's transforming.  It seems that no matter how many times I watch it, I keep learning new things from it each time.",5,"Don't miss the ""EXTRA""",1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,817,"['do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'having', 'ever', 'seen', 'DVD', 'Bonus', 'Extra', 'feature', 'added', 'extra', 'opinion', 'ESSENCE', 'Thich', 'Nhat', 'Hanh.The', 'biographical', 'main', 'feature', 'engaging', 'even', 'beautiful', 'what', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'biography', 'famous', 'painter', 'paintings', 'biography', 'famous', 'football', 'player', 'actual', 'film', 'clips', 'player', 'action', 'biography', 'famous', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'actual', 'words', 'monk', 'practice', 'teaches', 'how', 'incorporate', 'compassion', 'everyday', 'lives', 'watched', 'main', 'feature', 'many', 'times', 'certainly', 'benefited', 'extra', 'more', 'beautiful', 'transforming', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'keep', 'learning', 'new', 'things', 'time']",Peace Is Every Step-Meditation In Action: The Life and Work of Thich Nhat Hanh

He speaks in a way and writes in a way that the peace in his soul comes out and helps you to feel peaceful and free.  His breathing, exercise and meditation instructions are exceptional. There is nothing you will get that will ever disappoint you. Peace be with you.",5,Peace is everyday,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,327,"['have', 'liked', 'everything', 'have', 'purchased', 'Thich', 'Nhat', 'Hanh', 'way', 'way', 'peace', 'soul', 'out', 'feel', 'peaceful', 'free', 'breathing', 'exercise', 'meditation', 'instructions', 'are', 'exceptional', 'nothing', 'will', 'get', 'will', 'ever', 'disappoint', 'be']",Peace Is Every Step-Meditation In Action: The Life and Work of Thich Nhat Hanh
960852,A1J93EGDYK0IWA,B000CQNJ0U,"Patrick D. Goonan ""see profile for URL""","[40, 41]","This is a very well done portrait of Thich Nhat Hanh.  The most important and engaging aspect of this production is that is conveys Thich Nhat Hanh's personality and soul.  This is what I find to be the most transformational aspect of his Being.  To bring this forth so beautifully, constitutes art.While the documentary covers some highlights from the Vietnam period, the underlying message is really about finding peace in yourself and sharing this in your sphere of influence.  Part of this message is that everything and everyone is interdependent, Thich Nhat Hanh refers to this as ""interbeing.""  In other words, love and happiness by its very nature is intersubjective and individual happiness apart from others is an illusion.The film also portrays Plum Village, which is Thich Nhat Hanh's headquarters in France.  This is a worldwide retreat center and monastery and the film gives a feel for the day-to-day life of Thich Nhat Hanh.What I really value here is the portrayal of the inner life of a world famous leader and peace activist.  It conveys the power of love and non-violence that is embodies in this gentle and humble man.The film is also appropriate for younger people.  While there are vignettes of Vietnam, there were no violent scenes.  I think this makes the film ideal for kids 10 and older.  Thich Nhat Hanh is a great example of the power of vulnerability, sensitivity and gentle persistence coming from a grounded and loving place.  I believe this is a very worthwhile message to convey to our youth and the film length at less than an hour is idea for classroom environments.",5,"Suberb, captures the essence of the man and his work...",1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,1602,"['very', 'well', 'done', 'portrait', 'Thich', 'Nhat', 'Hanh', 'most', 'important', 'engaging', 'aspect', 'production', 'conveys', 'Thich', 'Nhat', 'Hanh', 'personality', 'soul', 'what', 'find', 'be', 'most', 'transformational', 'aspect', 'Being', 'bring', 'forth', 'so', 'beautifully', 'constitutes', 'documentary', 'highlights', 'Vietnam', 'period', 'underlying', 'message', 'really', 'finding', 'peace', 'sharing', 'sphere', 'influence', 'Part', 'message', 'everything', 'everyone', 'interdependent', 'Thich', 'Nhat', 'Hanh', 'refers', 'interbeing', 'other', 'words', 'love', 'happiness', 'very', 'nature', 'intersubjective', 'individual', 'happiness', 'apart', 'others', 'illusion.The', 'film', 'also', 'Plum', 'Village', 'Thich', 'Nhat', 'Hanh', 'headquarters', 'France', 'worldwide', 'retreat', 'center', 'monastery', 'film', 'feel', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'Thich', 'Nhat', 'Hanh.What', 'really', 'value', 'here', 'portrayal', 'inner', 'life', 'world', 'famous', 'leader', 'peace', 'activist', 'conveys', 'power', 'love', 'non-violence', 'embodies', 'gentle', 'humble', 'man.The', 'film', 'also', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'people', 'are', 'vignettes', 'Vietnam', 'were', 'violent', 'scenes', 'think', 'film', 'ideal', 'kids', '10', 'older', 'Thich', 'Nhat', 'Hanh', 'great', 'example', 'power', 'vulnerability', 'sensitivity', 'gentle', 'persistence', 'coming', 'grounded', 'loving', 'place', 'believe', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'message', 'convey', 'youth', 'film', 'length', 'less', 'hour', 'idea', 'classroom', 'environments']",Peace Is Every Step-Meditation In Action: The Life and Work of Thich Nhat Hanh
