Her name is Daniela (Monica Bellucci). He claims to have won the lottery and offers Daniela a large sum of money if she would come and live with him. As the two strangers get to know each other soon their financial agreement takes on emotional consequences that neither could have suspected. Before long their entanglement grows to encompass Francois friends, neighbors and work acquaintances as well as people, some significant, from Daniela's past.Critique: `How Much Do You Love Me' is a rather odd but enjoyable combination of erotica, romance and dark comedy rolled into one. While the viewer may find it difficult to decide exactly what genre the film is best suited for when all is said and done I would expect that they enjoyed watching. Monica Bellucci does what she does best as she subtly moves back and forth from sullen and smoldering to volcanic eruption. Bernard Campan also delivers a strong performance and there's also a small but memorable role played by one of France's finest actors, Gerard Depardieu.",4,"""What Is Happiness?""",1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,1219,"['Note', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles.Synopsis', 'Francois', 'Bernard', 'Campan', 'lonely', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'weak', 'heart', 'bordello', 'one', 'evening', 'eyes', 'transfixed', 'one', 'particular', 'hooker', 'name', 'Daniela', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'have', 'won', 'lottery', 'Daniela', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'would', 'come', 'live', 'two', 'strangers', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'soon', 'financial', 'agreement', 'emotional', 'consequences', 'could', 'have', 'suspected', 'long', 'entanglement', 'encompass', 'Francois', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'work', 'acquaintances', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'significant', 'Daniela', 'past.Critique', 'How', 'Much', 'Do', 'Love', 'Me', 'rather', 'odd', 'enjoyable', 'combination', 'erotica', 'romance', 'dark', 'comedy', 'rolled', 'one', 'viewer', 'may', 'find', 'difficult', 'decide', 'exactly', 'what', 'genre', 'film', 'best', 'suited', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'would', 'expect', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'what', 'best', 'subtly', 'moves', 'back', 'forth', 'sullen', 'smoldering', 'volcanic', 'eruption', 'Bernard', 'Campan', 'also', 'strong', 'performance', 'also', 'small', 'memorable', 'role', 'played', 'one', 'France', 'finest', 'actors', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu']",Combien tu m'aimes? / How much do you love me?(Original French Version with English Subtitles)

It also had shades of Nagisa Oshima's ""Etsuraku"" (""Pleasures of the Flesh"") 1965, slightly thrown into the mix. I for one, love this film! It was an intelligent farce on the never-ending battle of the sexes and of relationships in general, but with a French twist. This is a typical Blier comedy that will be trying for novices and francophobes alike. It seems the French are the best, when it comes to pointing the finger at their own bourgeois pretentions, where everything is fair game (religion, politics, race, etc.). But are able to come across as anything but hypocritical (the Italians and Spanish are a close second). What's not to like about this film, it is very very funny! Besides, the actors were simply incredible: Monica Bellucci as 'Daniela' (who hasn't looked this beautiful since ""Malena"" 2000), Bernard Campan as 'Francois', Jean-Pierre Darroussin as 'Andre' in a very funny but small role, and of course Gerard Depardieu as 'Charly' who was very good here. And this marked his eighth film collaboration with Bertrand Blier. If you are a big francophile like myself or even a little one, you will really get a kick out of this one.

1007647,A2KP0ONGECY1WT,B000GVWZKQ,"cs211 ""cs211""","[2, 3]","""How Much Do You Love Me?"" revolves around Monica Bellucci's character Daniela and the many different female roles she changes into and out of like so many pieces of clothing.  She is definitely a whore and a seductress, but she may or may not also be a girlfriend, a wife, a mistress, an accomplice, and a scam artist.  She is at times domineering but at others submissive and weak;  at times jealously possessive but at others open and free;  at times quiet and pensive but at others loud and raucous.  It takes a while for all these different sides of Daniela to appear, but by the end of the film she is changing between them seemingly in the blink of an eye.Few characters in the movie can resist falling for one or more sides of Daniela, and the audience too will fall in love with the performance Monica Bellucci gives in the role.  It certainly helps that Monica has the beauty and the body to pull of the role, and she is not shy about sharing her voluptuous charms with the camera.  In one scene she even instructs us on how she is able to seduce her target, and it is clear that Monica Bellucci knows how to use her considerable female attributes.The other strong performance in ""How Much Do You Love Me?"" comes from legendary French actor Gerard Depardieu.  Depardieu's character does not appear until the second half of the film, well after all the other main characters have been introduced, but Depardieu instantly captures the attention of the audience.  He has played many different characters in his career, and in ""How Much Do You Love Me?"" he looks like he was born to play the role of an amoral gangster.The main problem I had with ""How Much Do You Love Me?"" is that the action starts off slowly, and what is billed as a comedy feels like a depressive drama during the first third of the film.  As it turns out it takes a while for director and writer Bertrand Blier to set the stage, and the action picks up considerably in the second two thirds of the film.  ""How Much Do You Love Me?"" never turns into a slapstick farce;  instead, it is ultimately a sophisticated adult comedy about the different roles women can assume.  While being entertaining it also raises some interesting questions about just what the differences and boundaries are between those roles.",4,You'll love Monica Bellucci too after seeing this film,1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,2284,"['How', 'Much', 'Do', 'Love', 'Me', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'character', 'Daniela', 'many', 'different', 'female', 'so', 'many', 'pieces', 'clothing', 'definitely', 'whore', 'seductress', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'also', 'be', 'girlfriend', 'wife', 'mistress', 'accomplice', 'scam', 'artist', 'times', 'domineering', 'others', 'submissive', 'weak', 'times', 'jealously', 'possessive', 'others', 'open', 'free', 'times', 'quiet', 'pensive', 'others', 'loud', 'raucous', 'while', 'different', 'sides', 'Daniela', 'appear', 'end', 'film', 'changing', 'seemingly', 'blink', 'eye.Few', 'characters', 'movie', 'can', 'resist', 'falling', 'one', 'more', 'sides', 'Daniela', 'audience', 'too', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'performance', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'role', 'certainly', 'Monica', 'beauty', 'body', 'pull', 'role', 'not', 'shy', 'sharing', 'voluptuous', 'charms', 'camera', 'one', 'scene', 'even', 'how', 'able', 'seduce', 'target', 'clear', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'how', 'use', 'considerable', 'female', 'attributes.The', 'other', 'strong', 'performance', 'How', 'Much', 'Do', 'Love', 'Me', 'legendary', 'French', 'actor', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'Depardieu', 'character', 'not', 'appear', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'well', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'Depardieu', 'instantly', 'attention', 'audience', 'played', 'many', 'different', 'characters', 'career', 'How', 'Much', 'Do', 'Love', 'Me', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'role', 'amoral', 'gangster.The', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'How', 'Much', 'Do', 'Love', 'Me', 'action', 'slowly', 'what', 'billed', 'comedy', 'feels', 'depressive', 'drama', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'out', 'while', 'director', 'writer', 'Bertrand', 'Blier', 'set', 'stage', 'action', 'up', 'considerably', 'second', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'How', 'Much', 'Do', 'Love', 'Me', 'never', 'slapstick', 'farce', 'instead', 'ultimately', 'sophisticated', 'adult', 'comedy', 'different', 'roles', 'women', 'can', 'assume', 'being', 'entertaining', 'also', 'interesting', 'questions', 'just', 'what', 'differences', 'boundaries', 'are', 'roles']",Combien tu m'aimes? / How much do you love me?(Original French Version with English Subtitles)

The premise has been written about here, so I won't belabor the point.  What works: smart writing; great direction; a mixed sense of emotions, and the beauty that is Monica Bellucci.  They don't make 'em like her anymore.  Bellucci radiates a vulnerable sense of an old time movie star or should I say classic, so she doesn't sound so old - without her allure, this movie would simply not work.Lead actor Bernard Campan and Gerard Depardieu play their parts well, and serve as Monica's foils.  Although the film veers slightly into the theatre/stage like mode (think Moulin Rouge or old 1950s films) - it maintains its integrity because of its characters.  Moving along like an old Francois Truffaut film - light, dark, bouncy - the script inexplicably lets the reins go at the end and digresses into a melange of weak scenarios.  Like a beautiful horse ride in a carriage that hits a boulder and falls apart...In spite of this misgiving, the film is worth watching for Bellucci fans (eye candy, but also lovely acting chops - or is that her look?), but yes, a tighter script at the epilogue would have been so much more satisfying and fulfilled this film's promising start to a far more memorable status.  I have no idea why or how they lost the plot on this.

Maybe it just wanted to emulate theater and opera...The thing is, it just didn't work. The movie, and the characters, were all over the place.The story is ... very ""Pretty Woman"" with a twist. An office clerk tells a prostitute, Daniela (Bellucci), that he just won the lottery and he will pay her each month for living with him. Throw into the mix that he apparently has a weak heart, Daniela's pimp, curious friends and the possibility of love. Monica Bellucci is, as always, splendid, yet even she looked bored in this film. She was horribly mismatched with Bernard Campan and even Depardieu delivered inferior work. The problem is that the characters were underdeveloped and all over the place in their emotions, their stories and their desires. In fact, the viewer is at an equal disadvantage; we do not know what is going on, and it's not even funny!The dialogue is dry and melodramatic and soon turns into an ode to Bellucci's character (""she is a nuclear bomb"" ""she is a beautiful woman"", etc...). I understand that Bellucci is God's gift to men, but this movie's dialogue was more like an ode written by the director for Bellucci. Yet, with all the beauty and stellar acting, not even Bellucci can save this disastrous movie.This movie started out a bit film noir, then became a romantic comedy, then a gagster movie and then theater, throwing a bit of alternate states/frames of mind at the end.

Admittedly, I was drawn to it by the starring presence of Italian bombshell Monica Bellucci, and if you are a Bellucci fan this flik delivers!  Bellucci plays an 'escort' girl who is hired by a sort of nerdy guy, who claims to have won the lottery, to be his full-time, live-in 'wife' - until the money runs out. She accepts his offer but, unfortunately, she already has a 'boyfriend' who is a  gangster type and the plot thickens.  While this premise sounds like it might lead to some heavy situations, the movie is actually (surprisingly) light hearted throughout and almost surreal at times - both Euroflik qualities that I enjoy, as they differ from the typical Hollywood treatments. If you're looking for, or expecting, some meaningful arthouse noir-ish action this movie may not satisfy - it is somewhat enigmatic and goofy. If you're looking for a nice dose of Monica Bellucci then you won't be disappointed - this flik showcases her charms & beauty quite nicely and includes several nude & sex scenes that make you wish that YOU had won the lottery and could hire her to be your mate!

1007657,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000GVWZKQ,Tsuyoshi,"[9, 10]","In this French-Italian film ""Combien tu m'aimes?"" (""How Much Do You Love Me?"")  Monica Bellucci stars as beautiful prostitute Daniela, to whom an ordinary clerk Franois (Bernard Campan) offers a lucrative but strange deal - that is, one hundred thousand Euros a month if she agrees to live with him in his apartment room. Franois says he recently won lottery money and that she will receive monthly payment as long as the money lasts.Of course, Daniela agrees as Franois looks (and is) nice and honest, but what she didn't know is the changes that are going to happen inside her after the life with this mild-mannered man begins. The same goes for Franois, who changes from a lonely middle-aged bachelor to someone very different.Nothing is surprising about the film's basic plot except the peculiar ways how it is presented. Bertrand Blier directs the whole story without restraining the tone or style, which jumps from one to another without warning. After a very moody, quiet scene of lover's talk comes suddenly almost farce-like moment (such as the entire co-workers of his office arriving at Franois's door just to check how gorgeous his girlfriend is!).G&eacute;rard Depardieu also appears as gentlemanly and a bit eccentric gangster, who adds some comical touch to the middle section of the film. He and Bertrand Blier had previously worked together in such films as ""Les Valseuses,"" ""Buffet froid"" and ""Trop belle pour toi,"" but this one is probably the least memorable among the three.The film's promising start leads to a confusing ending that looks as if it has disintegrated into chaos. Luckily the chaos is of happy and merry kind, but I still think it needs to be tidied up to make the ""laundry"" scene more convincing. The film`s soundtrack is also unique, maybe too unique, using many songs from Italian operas. Some part of ""Combien tu m'aimes?"" should be called French director's love letter to Monica Bellucci and Italy, or something that two kinds of images of women Monica Bellucci shows in this film.""Combien tu m'aimes? is no masterpiece, too lightweight and often inconsistent. It is a comical version of male fantasy about perfect woman. After all you can say ""Combien tu m'aimes?"" is solely made for Monica Bellucci, who virtually carries the film to the end.",3,"Life with Monica Bellucci: Romance/Comedy about ""Perfect Woman""",1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,2285,"['French-Italian', 'film', 'Combien', 'tu', ""m'aimes"", 'How', 'Much', 'Do', 'Love', 'Me', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'beautiful', 'prostitute', 'Daniela', 'whom', 'ordinary', 'clerk', 'Franois', 'Bernard', 'Campan', 'lucrative', 'strange', 'deal', 'one', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'Euros', 'month', 'live', 'apartment', 'room', 'Franois', 'recently', 'won', 'lottery', 'money', 'will', 'receive', 'monthly', 'payment', 'as', 'long', 'money', 'lasts.Of', 'course', 'Daniela', 'Franois', 'nice', 'honest', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'changes', 'are', 'going', 'happen', 'life', 'mild-mannered', 'man', 'same', 'Franois', 'who', 'lonely', 'middle-aged', 'bachelor', 'someone', 'very', 'different.Nothing', 'surprising', 'film', 'basic', 'plot', 'peculiar', 'ways', 'how', 'presented', 'Bertrand', 'Blier', 'whole', 'story', 'restraining', 'tone', 'style', 'one', 'warning', 'very', 'moody', 'quiet', 'scene', 'lover', 'talk', 'suddenly', 'almost', 'farce-like', 'moment', 'such', 'entire', 'co-workers', 'office', 'arriving', 'Franois', 'door', 'just', 'check', 'how', 'gorgeous', 'girlfriend', '.G', 'eacute', 'rard', 'Depardieu', 'also', 'gentlemanly', 'bit', 'eccentric', 'gangster', 'who', 'comical', 'touch', 'middle', 'section', 'film', 'Bertrand', 'Blier', 'had', 'previously', 'worked', 'together', 'such', 'films', 'Les', 'Valseuses', 'Buffet', 'froid', 'Trop', 'belle', 'pour', 'toi', 'one', 'probably', 'least', 'memorable', 'three.The', 'film', 'promising', 'start', 'confusing', 'ending', 'disintegrated', 'chaos', 'Luckily', 'chaos', 'happy', 'merry', 'kind', 'still', 'think', 'be', 'tidied', 'make', 'laundry', 'scene', 'more', 'convincing', 'film', 's', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'unique', 'maybe', 'too', 'unique', 'using', 'many', 'songs', 'Italian', 'operas', 'part', 'Combien', 'tu', ""m'aimes"", 'should', 'be', 'called', 'French', 'director', 'love', 'letter', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'Italy', 'something', 'two', 'kinds', 'images', 'women', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'film', 'Combien', 'tu', ""m'aimes"", 'masterpiece', 'too', 'lightweight', 'often', 'inconsistent', 'comical', 'version', 'male', 'fantasy', 'perfect', 'woman', 'can', 'say', 'Combien', 'tu', ""m'aimes"", 'solely', 'made', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'who', 'virtually', 'film', 'end']",Combien tu m'aimes? / How much do you love me?(Original French Version with English Subtitles)
