Several times I taken by surprise by the humor and laughed out loud.Not really enough action/adventure for an action/adventure show.  A lot of human-study episodes, a lot of soul searching for poor Diego as he worries that so and so won't get better, or whether or not he should reveal his secret, etc.  If you enjoy that sort of thing, this is your show!If you just like that sort of thing, and can only take so much of it, you'll find, as I did, that the episodes are really much shorter than they think they are.  I finished two seasons in about 8 hours.  :-)On the other hand, the sword-play is pretty good, especially realistic as Zorro fights with hand, foot, etc., without losing his belief that, ""the death of any man diminishes every other man.""",4,They don't make 'em like they used to...,1311465600,"07 24, 2011",2011,781,"['Quirky', 'amusing', 'way', 'Several', 'times', 'taken', 'surprise', 'humor', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud.Not', 'really', 'enough', 'action/adventure', 'action/adventure', 'show', 'lot', 'human-study', 'episodes', 'lot', 'soul', 'searching', 'poor', 'Diego', 'so', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'not', 'should', 'reveal', 'secret', 'etc', 'enjoy', 'sort', 'thing', 'show', 'just', 'sort', 'thing', 'can', 'only', 'take', 'so', 'much', ""'ll"", 'find', 'did', 'episodes', 'are', 'really', 'much', 'shorter', 'think', 'are', 'finished', 'two', 'seasons', 'about', '8', 'hours', 'other', 'hand', 'sword-play', 'pretty', 'good', 'especially', 'realistic', 'Zorro', 'fights', 'hand', 'foot', 'etc.', 'losing', 'belief', 'death', 'man', 'diminishes', 'other', 'man']",N/A

There are several things about it I don't particularly care for (e,g, the laboratory in Zorro's cave, the half-silly, half-tyrannical Alcaldes), but on the other hand, there are some episodes that I really enjoy. And while Duncan Regehr provides hardly any contrast between his Diego and Zorro characters (which drives me nuts), he seems to get better as Zorro as the show moves along - even if he doesn't give the kind of swordfights that Guy Williams gave in his version of Zorro. James Victor is pretty good, and sometimes genuinely funny, as Sgt. Mendoza - the New World Zorro's answer to Sgt. Garcia. Patrice Martinez plays her character - Victoria, Zorro's love interest - very well, although why she was made the town's tavern-keeper is beyond me. Felipe, played by Juan Diego Botto, is okay, but he's certainly no Bernardo. Zorro's father Don Alejandro is played by two different actors in this show: in the first season, he was played by Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. - who, simply put, should never have been considered for the role; for the rest of the seasons, he is portrayed by Henry Darrow, who is much better at the role. The two Alcaldes of the show... well, they could have been better, but at least there are a number of other great villains whom Zorro must fight.(I must say that the last two seasons are the best. Season Four is especially worth having just for the episode ""Like Father, Like Son,"" in which Don Alejandro rides as Zorro!)In short, the show is not the best rendition of the famous swashbuckler of Spanish California, but at least it is clean and family-friendly, so it's not all that bad.",3,So-So Zorro,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,1669,"['feelings', 'New', 'World', 'Zorro', 'are', 'half-n-half', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'e', 'g', 'laboratory', 'Zorro', 'cave', 'half-silly', 'half-tyrannical', 'Alcaldes', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'episodes', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Duncan', 'Regehr', 'hardly', 'contrast', 'Diego', 'Zorro', 'characters', 'nuts', 'get', 'better', 'as', 'Zorro', 'show', 'even', ""n't"", 'give', 'kind', 'swordfights', 'Guy', 'Williams', 'gave', 'version', 'Zorro', 'James', 'Victor', 'pretty', 'good', 'sometimes', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'Sgt', 'Mendoza', 'New', 'World', 'Zorro', 'answer', 'Sgt', 'Garcia', 'Patrice', 'Martinez', 'character', 'Victoria', 'Zorro', 'love', 'interest', 'very', 'well', 'why', 'was', 'made', 'town', 'tavern-keeper', 'Felipe', 'played', 'Juan', 'Diego', 'Botto', 'okay', 'certainly', 'Bernardo', 'Zorro', 'father', 'Don', 'Alejandro', 'played', 'two', 'different', 'actors', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'played', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'Jr.', 'who', 'simply', 'put', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'role', 'rest', 'seasons', 'portrayed', 'Henry', 'Darrow', 'who', 'much', 'better', 'role', 'two', 'Alcaldes', 'show', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'least', 'are', 'number', 'other', 'great', 'villains', 'whom', 'Zorro', 'must', 'fight', 'must', 'say', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'best', 'Season', 'Four', 'especially', 'worth', 'having', 'just', 'episode', 'Father', 'Son', 'Don', 'Alejandro', 'Zorro', 'short', 'show', 'not', 'best', 'rendition', 'famous', 'swashbuckler', 'Spanish', 'California', 'least', 'clean', 'family-friendly', 'not', 'bad']",N/A

I went purely on the reviews of others and because I am a bit of a Duncan Regehr fan. After watching the series I must say that overall I thoroughly enjoyed the episodes and consider my money well spent. I gave the series an overall 5 star rating because of it's good entertainment; it has good comedy, story lines and is well acted by all. I enjoyed by far the majority of episodes, only a few that were borderline, but that has to be expected out of 88 episodes.The only one aspect that I really did not like was that in season one Don Diego's father was played by Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and then in the rest of the seasons his father is played by Henry Darrow. Both actors are good but it does not help the continuity of the story.I also wish that in the last episode that Zorro revealed who he was to his father and Victoria....oh well.The fifth dvd, ""The Zorro Archives"" has a 1920's silent movie which was initially funny but then quite boring after a while. (A little bit of advice make sure you have the fast forward remote control in your hand) I'm sure the 1920's Zorro was in his time quite dashing, but to me he looks creepy and he must be the most unfit Zorro ever as he smoked like a chimney!-interesting though!So...overall if you enjoy light-hearted entertainment or if you are a Zorro fan I would definitely recommend ""Zorro: The Complete Series""",5,The Complete Series -Completely Worthwhile,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,1444,"['actually', 'had', 'never', 'watched', 'Zorro', 'movies', 'episodes', 'prior', 'buying', 'set', 'went', 'purely', 'reviews', 'others', 'am', 'bit', 'Duncan', 'Regehr', 'fan', 'watching', 'series', 'must', 'say', 'overall', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'consider', 'money', 'well', 'spent', 'gave', 'series', 'overall', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'good', 'entertainment', 'good', 'comedy', 'story', 'lines', 'well', 'acted', 'enjoyed', 'far', 'majority', 'episodes', 'only', 'few', 'were', 'borderline', 'be', 'expected', '88', 'episodes.The', 'only', 'one', 'aspect', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'was', 'season', 'one', 'Don', 'Diego', 'father', 'was', 'played', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'Jr.', 'then', 'rest', 'seasons', 'father', 'played', 'Henry', 'Darrow', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'help', 'continuity', 'story.I', 'also', 'wish', 'last', 'episode', 'Zorro', 'revealed', 'who', 'was', 'father', 'Victoria', '.oh', 'well.The', 'fifth', 'dvd', 'Zorro', 'Archives', '1920', 'silent', 'movie', 'was', 'initially', 'funny', 'then', 'quite', 'boring', 'while', 'little', 'bit', 'advice', 'make', 'sure', 'have', 'fast', 'forward', 'remote', 'control', 'hand', ""'m"", 'sure', '1920', 'Zorro', 'was', 'time', 'quite', 'dashing', 'creepy', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'unfit', 'Zorro', 'ever', 'smoked', 'chimney', '-interesting', 'So', 'overall', 'enjoy', 'light-hearted', 'entertainment', 'are', 'Zorro', 'fan', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Zorro', 'Complete', 'Series']",N/A

Harry Darrow as Don Alejandro (Zorro's Father) is a great asset to the series.  (He even played Zorro and did the animated version as well).  My daughter was 7 years old when this series premiered on the Family Channel.  I've often wondered why this series didn't come out on dvd and suddenly here it is.

He is a fencer and told me Duncan Regehr was the best Zorro he'd ever seen and handles a sabre magnificently. I gave the show a try and quickly found myself hooked, though perhaps not for the same reasons. Being female I can appreciate more about Zorro, I believe, than my spouse can. (Indeed, I appreciate the fencing but I would watch the show even if he couldn't fence his way out of a box.)  Duncan Regehr plays a sexy Zorro with wit and charm, and I find myself laughing and smiling very frequently at what the actor brings to this legendary character. In addition, this man's voice is superb, almost hypnotic, the kind of voice that brings life and passion to poetry, the kind that makes a woman sigh with pleasure- quite appropriate for the romantic hero Zorro. That being said, this is a fun show that has something for everyone. The dialogue is humorous, the action is exciting, and most of all the ever-present romance is very sweet and keeps the viewers coming back for more.

I watched it when it was on Family Channel 20 years ago and was thrilled to see the whole series set at a reasonable price. I noticed Amazon has the 1st Season of the Disney version (39 episodes) at about $150.I've only had it for a week, but I tend to snarf up videos when I first get them. Some episodes I've already seen 3 times! I disagree with the reviewer that said the Christmas episodes were 'schmaltzy' or something like that. I was extremely touched by the ""It's a Wonderful Zorro"" the first time I saw it. Haven't we ALL wondered if we ever make a difference?I've always like Duncan Regehr, and I believe his Zorro/Diego is the best casting I've seen. At 6'5"", he's heads above the rest, (except Andre the Giant in his 2nd to last role of his life). He fences with the grace of his former sport, Canadian figure skating. A Renaissance man of the 20th Century playing a Renaissance man of the 19th Century is indeed perfect casting. Regehr has paintings hanging in the Western States Smithsonian Institute. His characterization was fun, sensitive, and very believable. You could tell he was having the time of his life. I'm actually glad he played Diego more 'studious' and 'weak-willed' than foppish. There is a difference. Others may point out other parts he's played as better, but not in my book. He's at his best Here!Even though I like Efrem Zimbalist Jr., who played Don Alejandro in the first season, I loved Henry Darrow taking over the part. The ""Like Father, Like Son"" episode where Alejandro thinks HE is Zorro, is absolutely hysterical. And yet, when confronting Diego's 'weak-willed' seeming unwillingness to confront or help, Darrow's tough stand as Alejandro, a disappointed and disgusted father made me cringe.So much I could say about this show that I like, and what I'm gleaning from it.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[74, 76]","Zorro is one of the more underrated heroes out there -- a sort of Hispanic cross between Robin Hood and Batman.Admittedly, I've never really been a huge fan of Zorro (I'm more of a Robin Hood girl), but one of the better representations of him is the well-beloved, family-friendly ""Zorro: The Complete Series."" It has some downsides, but it's a pleasantly upbeat series filled with romance, swordplay, sneering villains and a guy running around in a mask.Don Diego de la Vega (Duncan Regehr) is called back from his studies in Spain to his family estate in California. It turns out that Los Angeles (a tiny pueblo instead of the megacity it is now) is now ruled by the tyrannical Alcalde Luis Ramone (Michael Tylo). His father Don Alejandro (played first by Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. and then by Henry Darrow) and local tavern-keeper Victoria Escalante (Patrice Camhi Martinez) are opposing the Alcalde, which is putting them in danger.Everybody thinks of Diego as a mild-mannered nerd, and don't realize that he's actually a master swordsman, scientist and acrobat (just how long was he away?!). So with the help of his mute sidekick Felipe (Juan Diego Botto), a secret passage and a wild horse, Diego becomes El Zorro, who rides out and battles Alcalde Ramone and his successor Ignacio De Soto (John Hertzler), as well as various bandits, thieves and killers of all kinds.""Zorro: The Complete Series"" is a sunny, entertaining little show. It's crammed with unabashed swashbuckling, romance, touching moments,swordplay and comedic buttkicking. The dialogue has plenty of snappy (sometimes slightly cheesy) witticisms, especially when Diego is charging around in full Zorro garb.Some of the episodes are on the darker side (including one where Zorro battles a sadistic soldier), but overall the tone is sort of like an Errol Flynn movie stretched over four seasons. And while it sounds like the premise would be limited, the writers actually did an excellent job keeping things fresh with varied plots -- we've got pirate attacks, Japanese fishermen, jeweled swords, democratic elections, strange diseases, hypnosis and stolen gold, plus countless other stories.Downsides? The American Indians are pretty stereotypical, and the Christmas episodes are... schmaltzy. Seriously, Santa Claus visits the pueblo? Are you high?

His supporting cast was very good too! In terms of the swordfights, they were average with an occassional good one here and there. What sells this series (to me) is the storytelling and just the pure heart shown in the show.While I am not a ""bible thumper"" or some extreme moralist, let me say that for those that want action that's good quality family entertainment, this is for you! Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the recent incarnations of Zorro (particularlyThe Mask of Zorro (Deluxe Edition)with Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins) but this one is safe for kids so if you have a family, you don't have to worry about your children being exposed to anything you don't want them to see in their young lives. In fact, I can only remember perhaps two or three dark episodes (particularly Broken Masks, Broken Hearts when Victoria is almost murdered by one of Zorro's enemies) of Zorro from this show and even those are safe enough for kids to watch. There were many memoriable guest performances as well on the series, particularly Adam West (of Batman fame), ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper (as Bishop) and the late Andre The Giant.Back to the series, my only gripe is that they didn't really finish it properly!

I liked this series better than the older one, the one with Bernardo, because it had a child in it. I loved the character of Felipe. He was a few years older than me, but he was still a child and he did great things. When you are a child you know you are way weaker than adults, and watching someone who's not grown up yet really help grown ups it's wonderful. Juan Diego Botto was not the skilled actor he is now, but what difference does it make when you are a child yourself? The birth of a good actor is evident, though, even in the first series, when Juan Diego was really young (13-14): the way he reacts to the baby Zorro saves and then leaves to Felipe as he has better things to do, the way he copies everything Don Diego does, the way he plays with Zorro's stuff though he shouldn't and quickly tries and hides what he has done... The bomb scene is hilarious. He pulls the trigger, Diego comes back and asks him whether he has touched anything and Felipe shakes his head moments before the bomb bursting.... Just funny. I despised Alejandro back then.  I hated the way he felt about Diego. I thought he should love him as he was.  Now that I am a parent myself, I understand him better, though I continue to think he should have appreciated his son for the wonderful gifts he had.Of course, this is not a history documentary, but it's simple, fun entertainment for the whole family: clean language, good feelings, acceptance of diversity...

I found the show to be entertaining, heart-warming, and utterly family friendly. Duncan Regehr's performance in the lead role is in keeping with the quaility of the performances of Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power, Guy Williams, and Antonio Banderas. Many of the behind-the-scenes people worked in another popular Tv show Highlander: the Series, including Peter Diamond,the swordmaster.My only disappointment with the dvd is with the special features. Although I appreciate the classic Zorro presentations, I believe special features should always include interviews with those who made the series and commentary on select episodes.

1380261,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,B0041KKBFE,HAMLET,"[4, 4]","So begins the adventures of Zorro for a whole new generation. I watched this series when it came on (I was four when it premiered on TV) and wore out the VHS tapes on which my uncle had recorded the episodes; actually, my crappy VCR ruined the tapes as I was trying to watch them a few years ago. I'm thrilled that this family-friendly series will at last be on DVD. Very much like the classic 1957 Disney series starring Guy Williams, this series shows Diego's softer side and the romance plays an integral part of the show. There's nothing offensive, just good old-fashioned swordplay and gun fights (though some might find the Season 3 episode ""Siege"" a little intense), clean humor, chaste romance and usually a moral during each episode. I highly recommend this series. You'll be carving Z's everywhere once you finish watching the episodes. I think Colonel Palomarez, Thackeray & Risendo are some of the show's finest villains. Of course, Zorro always wins. The acting is top-notch. Duncan Regehr is excellent as Don Diego/Zorro, bringing real empathy and weight to the role. He was perfectly cast, as were the other actors (though I prefer Efrem Zimbalist Jr as Don Alejandro, though Henry Darrow was also very good). Watch for a connection to ""Batman,"" another classic series.

1380262,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B0041KKBFE,Haunted Flower,"[4, 22]","88 Episodes on 14 DVD Discs, being released January 25, 2010Ok, I just put in the first disc of ""Zorro"" the complete series which I have NEVER watched before and I have to say...I am already laughing. This theme song ""...His name is ZORRO!!!"" is cracking me up. When the score jumps in, it's a happy little beat with some drums in the background and the set and lighting quality remind me of the ""Fairy Tale Theatre"" series of my childhood. The picture quality is a bit fuzzy and the DVD transition does not improve the clarity. It feels like you are watching an old wooden television in your grandparents' house.Let's see, there's a big bad guy who is abusing the town by doing bad things like taking away their water. He is always trying to find out Zorro's identity and failing. Women think Zorro is hot. One woman wants to leave Zorro's cousin for him. All the women look the same to me. All the episodes begin to blend together. There's a case of mistaken identity where someone else runs around in black with a mask pretending to be Zorro and doing bad things (like THAT'S hard to do....). He has a lab where he invents a cure for a young boy's disease, he crosses swords with the three musketeers, he exposes a young woman of being a gold digger for his father's fortune, yadda yadda yadda.This story takes place in the early 19th century New World (California) and was shot entirely in Spain. Don Diego de la Vega played by Duncan Regehr is a mild, scholarly son of a wealthy landowner Don Alejandro (played by Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. and the role is later taken over by Henry Darrow) and has a sidekick (pretend) deaf mute servant named Felipe played by Juan Diego Botto. He lives a dual life as protector of the people, Zorro! He dresses all in black with a mask and rides a black horse and in swordplay produces three slashes that make a ""Z"". The first innocent he protects is beautiful tavern owner and love interest throughout the series, Victoria played by Patrice Camhi. She has a huge crush on him from then on and often fights with other women over him. His biggest antagonist is Alcalde played by Michael Tylo who often sets up situations to attempt to unmask the hero. The bumbling Sergeant Mendoza played by James Victor is secretly on Zorro's side but puts on a good show of hunting him down.There are several guest stars over the seasons including Adam West as an eccentric inventor going head to head with the original ""caped crusader"" of justice. Other names that appear in the series are Doug McClure, Warwick Davis, Peter Postlethwaite, Patsy Rowlands, Tim Reid, Bernard Kay, Patrick Drury, Peter Guinness, WWE stars - Roddy Piper, Andre the Giant, Jesse Ventura, and believe it or not, Daniel Craig.Bonus Features:The best feature by far is ""The Mark of Zorro"" starring Douglas Fairbanks which is an original full-length silent film that really defines the ""swashbuckling"" era of film. This is a great little gem for collectors, purists, and really old fans. ;-) It's a little fuzzy and shaky with those little flecks appearing on the screen, but a relic as far as eyeliner on men goes. Another feature is Chapter 1 of the 1939 theatrical series ""Zorro's Fighting Legion"". It has a singing introduction and is fuzzy and in black and white, but again a great place to look back at seeing the journey of Zorro in cinema. There are also trailers for ""Zorro's Fighting Legion"", ""Zorro's Black Whip"", and ""Zorro Rides Again.""There is a photo gallery for the New World ""Zorro"" and the original, never before released pilot for the series. In the alternate pilot, Zorro has a completely different upbringing and sounds spoiled and was being played by a different actor. The opening didn't have the big bellowing song, but instead had classical music playing. The girl and the sergeant were still played by the same actors, but the sergeant is a bad guy instead of a joke. He is attacking children and shoots a woman less than five minutes in! The love interest instead of being a tavern owner appears to be higher class and wears fancy dresses. Antonio (Zorro) is a jerk and looks down on women insulting her right and left. VERY different direction! Someone else starts as Zorro and when the man is taken down, Antonio takes up the mask and legend (just like the Dread Pirate Roberts!). Felipe isn't deaf and mute, just dumb.",2,Zorro - yikes.....,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,4343,"['88', 'Episodes', '14', 'DVD', 'Discs', 'being', 'released', 'January', '25', '2010Ok', 'just', 'put', 'first', 'disc', 'Zorro', 'complete', 'series', 'have', 'NEVER', 'watched', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'already', 'laughing', 'theme', 'song', 'name', 'ZORRO', 'cracking', 'up', 'When', 'score', 'jumps', 'happy', 'little', 'beat', 'drums', 'background', 'set', 'lighting', 'quality', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'Theatre', 'series', 'childhood', 'picture', 'quality', 'bit', 'fuzzy', 'DVD', 'transition', 'not', 'improve', 'clarity', 'are', 'watching', 'old', 'wooden', 'television', 'grandparents', 'house.Let', 'see', 'big', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'abusing', 'town', 'doing', 'bad', 'things', 'taking', 'away', 'water', 'always', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'Zorro', 'identity', 'failing', 'Women', 'think', 'Zorro', 'hot', 'One', 'woman', 'leave', 'Zorro', 'cousin', 'women', 'look', 'same', 'episodes', 'begin', 'blend', 'together', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'where', 'someone', 'else', 'black', 'mask', 'pretending', 'be', 'Zorro', 'doing', 'bad', 'things', 'hard', 'do', 'lab', 'where', 'cure', 'young', 'boy', 'disease', 'swords', 'three', 'musketeers', 'young', 'woman', 'being', 'gold', 'digger', 'father', 'fortune', 'yadda', 'yadda.This', 'story', 'place', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'New', 'World', 'California', 'was', 'shot', 'entirely', 'Spain', 'Don', 'Diego', 'la', 'Vega', 'played', 'Duncan', 'Regehr', 'mild', 'scholarly', 'son', 'wealthy', 'landowner', 'Don', 'Alejandro', 'played', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'Jr.', 'role', 'later', 'taken', 'over', 'Henry', 'Darrow', 'sidekick', 'pretend', 'deaf', 'mute', 'servant', 'named', 'Felipe', 'played', 'Juan', 'Diego', 'Botto', 'dual', 'life', 'protector', 'people', 'Zorro', 'black', 'mask', 'black', 'horse', 'swordplay', 'produces', 'three', 'slashes', 'make', 'Z', 'first', 'innocent', 'beautiful', 'tavern', 'owner', 'love', 'interest', 'series', 'Victoria', 'played', 'Patrice', 'Camhi', 'huge', 'crush', 'then', 'often', 'fights', 'other', 'women', 'biggest', 'antagonist', 'Alcalde', 'played', 'Michael', 'Tylo', 'who', 'often', 'up', 'situations', 'attempt', 'unmask', 'hero', 'bumbling', 'Sergeant', 'Mendoza', 'played', 'James', 'Victor', 'secretly', 'Zorro', 'side', 'good', 'show', 'hunting', 'down.There', 'are', 'several', 'guest', 'stars', 'seasons', 'including', 'Adam', 'West', 'eccentric', 'inventor', 'going', 'head', 'head', 'original', 'caped', 'crusader', 'justice', 'Other', 'names', 'appear', 'series', 'are', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'Warwick', 'Davis', 'Peter', 'Postlethwaite', 'Patsy', 'Rowlands', 'Tim', 'Reid', 'Bernard', 'Kay', 'Patrick', 'Drury', 'Peter', 'Guinness', 'WWE', 'Roddy', 'Piper', 'Andre', 'Giant', 'Jesse', 'Ventura', 'believe', 'not', 'Daniel', 'Craig.Bonus', 'Features', 'best', 'feature', 'far', 'Mark', 'Zorro', 'starring', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'original', 'full-length', 'silent', 'film', 'really', 'swashbuckling', 'era', 'film', 'great', 'little', 'gem', 'collectors', 'purists', 'really', 'old', 'fans', 'little', 'fuzzy', 'shaky', 'little', 'flecks', 'appearing', 'screen', 'relic', 'as', 'far', 'eyeliner', 'men', 'feature', 'Chapter', '1', '1939', 'theatrical', 'series', 'Zorro', 'Fighting', 'Legion', 'singing', 'introduction', 'fuzzy', 'black', 'white', 'again', 'great', 'place', 'look', 'back', 'seeing', 'journey', 'Zorro', 'cinema', 'are', 'also', 'trailers', 'Zorro', 'Fighting', 'Legion', 'Zorro', 'Black', 'Whip', 'Zorro', 'Rides', 'Again', 'photo', 'gallery', 'New', 'World', 'Zorro', 'original', 'never', 'released', 'pilot', 'series', 'alternate', 'pilot', 'Zorro', 'completely', 'different', 'upbringing', 'spoiled', 'was', 'being', 'played', 'different', 'actor', 'opening', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'bellowing', 'song', 'instead', 'had', 'classical', 'music', 'playing', 'girl', 'sergeant', 'were', 'still', 'played', 'same', 'actors', 'sergeant', 'bad', 'guy', 'instead', 'joke', 'attacking', 'children', 'shoots', 'woman', 'less', 'five', 'minutes', 'love', 'interest', 'instead', 'being', 'tavern', 'owner', 'be', 'higher', 'class', 'wears', 'fancy', 'dresses', 'Antonio', 'Zorro', 'jerk', 'down', 'women', 'insulting', 'right', 'left', 'VERY', 'different', 'direction', 'Someone', 'else', 'Zorro', 'when', 'man', 'taken', 'down', 'Antonio', 'up', 'mask', 'legend', 'just', 'Dread', 'Pirate', 'Roberts', 'Felipe', ""n't"", 'deaf', 'mute', 'just', 'dumb']",N/A

The rest of the cast was great, too.Unfortunately, I didn't even know this series was on TV until the second season.  I saw that, but not Season 1. Then I had to go overseas and missed Seasons 3 and 4.  The last episode of the series was put on a VHS tape as a 2 hour movie entitled, ""Conspiracy of Blood.""  That episode appears as a 4 part episode on the DVD, and is not in it's entirety.  There are 3 other episodes that are shown in parts and not in it's entirety.There are a few things that disappointed me.  First, the multi part episodes that were not in full.  Second, the last episode of the series.  When a show is canceled, I believe the writers should let it all out.  Secrets and identities are revealed, etc.  It's not as if Zorro hasn't revealed his identity to anyone except the mute servant in any TV show or movie.  Diego could have told his father and Victoria the truth and declared his love to Victoria in the last episode.  Instead, we get a scene of Diego's father asking him a question that would have brought out Diego's confession about his double life.  Unfortunately, the show ends without Diego answering his father's question.  He told his father the truth in the Disney version of ""Zorro.""All that aside, I still think the show was terrific.

It had too much telenovela silliness and not enough Zorro, but it got me interested in the genre.  I vaguely remembered seeing some scenes from this Zorro back in the 90's, but I had never watched it.  After the Telemundo Zorro, I wanted to try it out and the reviews here on Amazon were so good, I was very excited to get it (plus Amazon had it on a good sale for a weekend).To be honest, so far I have only made it through the first DVD of the first season, but it has been quite painful.  This is SOOO bad.  It's almost on the level of the original Batman (except Batman knew it was silly).  There is no real drama, but to be fair it's hard to get real deep in a half hour show, especially when you have to have at least one sword fight plus a feel good ending where they all sit around laughing at the goofy sergeant.  Not only is it family friendly, it seems written for, if not by, 12 year olds.  The dialogue is ridiculous, the characters are one dimensional, the plots are silly and predictable, and the theme song is terrible (To compare, listen to/watch the theme song from the Telemundo version, Amor Gitano by Beyonce and Alejandro Fernandez).  (By the way, I just watched the episode where a fake Zorro burns down a Native American village.  I'm certainly not sure, but did the Native Americans in California use tipis?)Is this going to get better?  I'm doubting it, but I'll keep going through another disc before I try one of the other seasons.

1380271,AMC60OBU46JDH,B0041KKBFE,Nancy J. Smith,"[5, 5]","I was really overjoyed when I heard that the New World Zorro, one of my favorite shows, was going to be on dvd. I remember watching The New World Zorro back in the 90's. It appeared on the now defunct Family Channel.The episodes were only thirty minutes long, but they tried to make them very entertaining, and exciting. My only regret is that they didn't make the episodes an hour long so they could have explored the backgrounds of all the characters on the show, and added more plots and action scenes. As far as love scenes, they were limited to that since it was a ""family show"" and young people were watching. ;-) But otherwise it was a wonderful show. I'm also happy that Amazon reduced the price of the dvds and made them more affordable. ;-) I especially appreciated the way they packaged the dvds and put them in those very nice cases to keep them from getting scratched or damaged. Packaging is everything. :-) That would have been nice also if the people who put out the dvds would have added some ""behind the scenes"" special features where the cast and crew talked about their experiences doing the episodes and even added some bloopers. That would have been funny too. But I guess those people weren't available for commentary or they just didn't have time. So instead they gave us these old Zorro episodes and a pilot of the NW Zorro with another actor being Don Diego/Zorro and different Alcalde too. Not to mention Patrice Martinez being a totally different character. Also they added some photos from the NW Zorro show. The episodes are well formatted and look as if they were just made yesterday. Thanks to modern technology, they look sharper, and clearer. I also noticed that without commercials the episodes are about 22 minutes long. That was interesting considering they were 30 on tv. But that was with commercials. lol Another thing that would have been good to have would have been some commentary on the the episodes. Like how they did the stunts, etc. But just having the episodes alone is wonderful. I've had second-hand tapes which I bought from someone who copied the show for me, and it's refreshing to have them on DVD. I'm glad they were able to make our dreams come true for all of us NW Zorro fans. You definitely won't be wasting any money on these episodes. And you can show them to your children without any worry of bad language or smutty sex scenes. These are definitely family oriented episodes. They will entertain you for years to come. :-) The acting is great. Duncan Regehr gives a superb performance as Don Diego/Zorro. The young man who played Felipe, Juan Diego Botto, does a good job too of being Diego's young companion who is mute and pretends to be deaf as well. He is a wonderful actor and not only adds to the plots, but appeals to the younger generation as well. The other actors, Patrice Martinez/Camhi, veteran actors Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Henry Darrow are excellent as Zorro's tavern owner girlfriend Victoria Escalante, and Diego's father Alejandro De La Vega. The two actors who played the Alcalde, Michael Tylo, and John Hertzler are supperb as the ever scheming evil Alcaldes. Last but not least, James Victor is a comic relief and wonderful actor as well, as the bumbling, inept,Sergeant Garcia. Together, these fine actors make a wonderful show. Well, that's my review. I hope this was helpful. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to express my thoughts on this really good show. :-)",5,Review of the New World Zorro Complete Series DVDS,1311465600,"07 24, 2011",2011,3452,"['was', 'really', 'overjoyed', 'when', 'heard', 'New', 'World', 'Zorro', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'dvd', 'remember', 'watching', 'New', 'World', 'Zorro', 'back', '90', 'appeared', 'now', 'defunct', 'Family', 'Channel.The', 'episodes', 'were', 'only', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'long', 'tried', 'make', 'very', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'only', 'regret', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'episodes', 'hour', 'long', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'explored', 'backgrounds', 'characters', 'show', 'added', 'more', 'plots', 'action', 'scenes', 'As', 'far', 'love', 'scenes', 'were', 'limited', 'was', 'family', 'show', 'young', 'people', 'were', 'watching', 'otherwise', 'was', 'wonderful', 'show', ""'m"", 'also', 'happy', 'Amazon', 'reduced', 'price', 'dvds', 'made', 'more', 'affordable', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'way', 'packaged', 'dvds', 'put', 'very', 'nice', 'cases', 'keep', 'getting', 'scratched', 'damaged', 'Packaging', 'everything', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'put', 'out', 'dvds', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'scenes', 'special', 'features', 'where', 'cast', 'crew', 'talked', 'experiences', 'doing', 'episodes', 'even', 'added', 'bloopers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'too', 'guess', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'available', 'commentary', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'So', 'instead', 'gave', 'old', 'Zorro', 'episodes', 'pilot', 'NW', 'Zorro', 'actor', 'being', 'Don', 'Diego/Zorro', 'different', 'Alcalde', 'too', 'Not', 'mention', 'Patrice', 'Martinez', 'being', 'totally', 'different', 'character', 'Also', 'added', 'photos', 'NW', 'Zorro', 'show', 'episodes', 'are', 'well', 'formatted', 'look', 'were', 'just', 'made', 'yesterday', 'Thanks', 'modern', 'technology', 'look', 'sharper', 'clearer', 'also', 'noticed', 'commercials', 'episodes', 'are', '22', 'minutes', 'long', 'was', 'interesting', 'considering', 'were', '30', 'tv', 'was', 'commercials', 'lol', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'have', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'how', 'did', 'stunts', 'etc', 'just', 'having', 'episodes', 'alone', 'wonderful', ""'ve"", 'had', 'second-hand', 'tapes', 'bought', 'someone', 'who', 'copied', 'show', 'refreshing', 'have', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'glad', 'were', 'able', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'NW', 'Zorro', 'fans', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'wasting', 'money', 'episodes', 'can', 'show', 'children', 'worry', 'bad', 'language', 'smutty', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'definitely', 'family', 'oriented', 'episodes', 'will', 'entertain', 'years', 'come', 'acting', 'great', 'Duncan', 'Regehr', 'superb', 'performance', 'Don', 'Diego/Zorro', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Felipe', 'Juan', 'Diego', 'Botto', 'good', 'job', 'too', 'being', 'Diego', 'young', 'companion', 'who', 'mute', 'pretends', 'be', 'deaf', 'as', 'well', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'not', 'only', 'plots', 'appeals', 'younger', 'generation', 'well', 'other', 'actors', 'Patrice', 'Martinez/Camhi', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'Jr.', 'Henry', 'Darrow', 'are', 'excellent', 'Zorro', 'tavern', 'owner', 'girlfriend', 'Victoria', 'Escalante', 'Diego', 'father', 'Alejandro', 'De', 'La', 'Vega', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Alcalde', 'Michael', 'Tylo', 'John', 'Hertzler', 'are', 'supperb', 'ever', 'scheming', 'evil', 'Alcaldes', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'James', 'Victor', 'comic', 'relief', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'well', 'bumbling', 'inept', 'Sergeant', 'Garcia', 'Together', 'fine', 'actors', 'make', 'wonderful', 'show', 'Well', 'review', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful', 'Thanks', 'giving', 'opportunity', 'express', 'thoughts', 'really', 'good', 'show']",N/A

1380277,A2KKK0FWPDU7BP,B0041KKBFE,"Synkhara-JW ""synkhara""","[2, 6]","I really wanted to love this series because 1 I've been a big Zorro fan all my life and 2 I'm also a Duncan R fan, his evil prince was the best part of Wizards & Warriors (another show I wish was on DVD). But this show was a bit disappointing due to lack of energy. If you've seen the Disney series it's impossible not to compare them. Guy Williams is without doubt the best Zorro ever but DR is 2nd. He does a fine job. However there was no excitement or energy at all in the 1st season and some of the stories seemed familiar because parts of them were taken from the Disney series, now made into stories that are dull, predictable and uninspired. The music seems more inclined to put the audience to sleep than evoke adventure even during the chase scenes.It starts to get better part way through the 2nd season but it's a shame we have to say Adios to the cute blond guy. (I can't think of many shows where the bad guy is actually better looking than the good guy and with DR being the good guy here that's saying a lot.) The stories get better, less like copies, and the show picks up by the end of the 2nd season. Except of course for the 2 part pirate searching for his son episodes in the 3rd season, which were awful (the pirate overacted and the kid couldn't act at all, it was embarrassing). And Santa Claus, seriously? Both Xmas episodes were meant to be touching but ended up seeming kind of silly. I also thought it rather lame that by the end of the 1st season Zorro seems able to walk into the pueblo any time he wants to hang out and stand around talking with the alcalde and soldiers. That seemed sort of strange.The unreleased original pilot is included on the bonus disc. But it makes me glad I never saw it because I thought it was bad. It seemed really thrown-together quickly and I`m surprised the series even got made with a pilot like this.*Spoilers*The 4th and last season was the best however it seemed illogical for him to decide to tell his father who he was then turn around and change his mind for no good reason. And to propose to the woman he loves without revealing his identity seemed totally unfair to both of them.This is one of those unfortunate shows that stops but doesn't end. Not as bad as those who have ended the final episode with a cliff hanger (like Kyle XY, Lost World, John Doe, etc.) but the last episode left me totally unsatisfied and frustrated. If there had just been 1 more episode to resolve things I would have given this 4 stars & called it a very good show. But it didn't so I can't.The best part about this series though is the absolutely gorgeous Andalusians. They are breath taking.",3,"Disappointed & wish it had ended better, good but not great",1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,2644,"['really', 'wanted', 'love', 'series', '1', ""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'Zorro', 'fan', 'life', '2', ""'m"", 'also', 'Duncan', 'R', 'fan', 'evil', 'prince', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'Wizards', 'Warriors', 'show', 'wish', 'was', 'DVD', 'show', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'due', 'lack', 'energy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Disney', 'series', 'impossible', 'not', 'compare', 'Guy', 'Williams', 'doubt', 'best', 'Zorro', 'ever', 'DR', '2nd', 'fine', 'job', 'However', 'was', 'excitement', 'energy', '1st', 'season', 'stories', 'seemed', 'familiar', 'parts', 'were', 'taken', 'Disney', 'series', 'now', 'made', 'stories', 'are', 'dull', 'predictable', 'uninspired', 'music', 'more', 'inclined', 'put', 'audience', 'sleep', 'evoke', 'adventure', 'even', 'chase', 'scenes.It', 'get', 'better', 'part', 'way', '2nd', 'season', 'shame', 'have', 'say', 'Adios', 'cute', 'blond', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'shows', 'where', 'bad', 'guy', 'actually', 'better', 'looking', 'good', 'guy', 'DR', 'being', 'good', 'guy', 'here', 'saying', 'lot', 'stories', 'get', 'better', 'less', 'copies', 'show', 'up', 'end', '2nd', 'season', 'course', '2', 'part', 'pirate', 'searching', 'son', 'episodes', '3rd', 'season', 'were', 'awful', 'pirate', 'overacted', 'kid', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'seriously', 'Xmas', 'episodes', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'touching', 'ended', 'up', 'seeming', 'kind', 'silly', 'also', 'thought', 'rather', 'lame', 'end', '1st', 'season', 'Zorro', 'able', 'walk', 'pueblo', 'time', 'hang', 'out', 'stand', 'around', 'talking', 'alcalde', 'soldiers', 'seemed', 'sort', 'strange.The', 'unreleased', 'original', 'pilot', 'included', 'bonus', 'disc', 'glad', 'never', 'saw', 'thought', 'was', 'bad', 'seemed', 'really', 'thrown-together', 'quickly', 'm', 'surprised', 'series', 'even', 'got', 'made', 'pilot', '*Spoilers*The', '4th', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'best', 'however', 'seemed', 'illogical', 'decide', 'tell', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'then', 'turn', 'around', 'change', 'mind', 'good', 'reason', 'propose', 'woman', 'revealing', 'identity', 'seemed', 'totally', 'unfair', 'them.This', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'shows', 'stops', ""n't"", 'end', 'Not', 'as', 'bad', 'who', 'have', 'ended', 'final', 'episode', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'Lost', 'World', 'John', 'Doe', 'etc', 'last', 'episode', 'left', 'totally', 'unsatisfied', 'frustrated', 'had', 'just', 'been', '1', 'more', 'episode', 'resolve', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'given', '4', 'stars', 'called', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', ""can't.The"", 'best', 'part', 'series', 'though', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'Andalusians', 'are', 'breath', 'taking']",N/A

As a longtime Zorro fan, I can safely say that this series provides quality acting, sufficient action, and good family values at a time when they are sorely needed in the modern world.  Duncan Regehr leads a fine supporting cast and he provides a depth to the character of Zorro not seen before or since.  I liked the Disney series and I enjoyed the Banderas films, but this series remains most faithful to the the intent of the original Zorro stories.
