1289977,AJ8CBMFSPRKQU,B002UL1SXK,&#60;/&#62;&#60;,"[12, 16]","A movie on Near Death Experiences and yet it's top ""star"" is Neale Donald Walsch. In the movie Neale starts off saying he was fighting/yelling at his wife and then went to take a nap and then had an 'out of body experience'. I mean come on! WHY would the producers of this film TRASH the contents by putting that rubbish into the movie? Neale just does it all doesn't he? Talks and jokes around with God in his head, has an out of body experience, knows the future....whatever!  The other notable star of this movie is Dannion Brinkley among other people who had a REAL NDE. These real stars are enjoyable to see, but you always back to Neale and listen to him as he speaks in his sweet soft whimpy ""spiritual"" voice, the others come off as ""normal"" people sharing their NDE experiences. The film maker though didnt really ""listen"" much to the people, one scene where Dannion Brinkley starts off his NDE, they show a wintery scene, this guy is from South Carolina and he had his NDE on a wet rainy day, I mean just utter nonsense! I'm not really sure what the intentions of this movie truly was? You have a few story's of NDE then Neale's ""dream"", along with helicopter like scenes of earth, accompanied with ""swishing"" and ""swooshing"" like sounds. Just a horrible made film, if you can delete out Neale, it would be much better from just that, but even then, the film is bad, let the people tell their story' without going back to this person than back to that person, blah blah. This film is nothing new, I'd recommend getting the 1995 film ""Saved by the Light"" or for the documentary get ""Life after Life"" an older 1990 film which is 10 times more better of film to watch and production wise. I originally gave this 3 stars, then 2, but really, I just cannot stomach to see this trash with Neale in it, just ruins ALL credibility. If they edit him out I'd give it 4 stars.",1,why is Neale Donald Walsch even in this movie?,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,1875,"['movie', 'Near', 'Death', 'Experiences', 'yet', 'top', 'star', 'Neale', 'Donald', 'Walsch', 'movie', 'Neale', 'saying', 'was', 'fighting/yelling', 'wife', 'then', 'went', 'take', 'nap', 'then', 'had', ""'out"", 'body', 'experience', 'mean', 'come', 'WHY', 'would', 'producers', 'film', 'TRASH', 'contents', 'putting', 'rubbish', 'movie', 'Neale', 'just', ""n't"", 'Talks', 'jokes', 'God', 'head', 'body', 'experience', 'future', '.whatever', 'other', 'notable', 'star', 'movie', 'Dannion', 'Brinkley', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'REAL', 'NDE', 'real', 'stars', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'always', 'back', 'Neale', 'listen', 'sweet', 'soft', 'whimpy', 'spiritual', 'voice', 'others', 'come', 'off', 'normal', 'people', 'sharing', 'NDE', 'experiences', 'film', 'maker', 'didnt', 'really', 'listen', 'much', 'people', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Dannion', 'Brinkley', 'NDE', 'show', 'wintery', 'scene', 'guy', 'South', 'Carolina', 'had', 'NDE', 'wet', 'rainy', 'day', 'mean', 'just', 'utter', 'nonsense', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'intentions', 'movie', 'truly', 'was', 'have', 'few', 'story', 'NDE', 'then', 'Neale', 'dream', 'helicopter', 'scenes', 'earth', 'accompanied', 'swishing', 'swooshing', 'sounds', 'Just', 'horrible', 'made', 'film', 'can', 'delete', 'out', 'Neale', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'just', 'even', 'then', 'film', 'bad', 'let', 'people', 'tell', 'story', 'going', 'back', 'person', 'back', 'person', 'blah', 'blah', 'film', 'nothing', 'new', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'getting', '1995', 'film', 'Saved', 'Light', 'documentary', 'get', 'Life', 'Life', 'older', '1990', 'film', '10', 'times', 'more', 'better', 'film', 'watch', 'production', 'wise', 'originally', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'then', '2', 'really', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'stomach', 'see', 'trash', 'Neale', 'just', 'credibility', 'edit', 'out', ""'d"", 'give', '4', 'stars']",Infinity:The Ultimate Trip..

Too much of the video is spent with Neale Donald Walsch talking in his wispy, low, mumbling, rambling, ""spiritual"" voice. Of all the people in the video interviewed he was by far the least credible and least interesting. On the flip side very little time is spent with Brian Weiss who has decades of research into past life regressions and can speak more from a fact based / clinical perspective.

1289979,A1X73QJ7D1W57Q,B002UL1SXK,Bodhi Heeren,"[14, 16]","The ruling scientific paradigm with its naive belief in monistic materialism has ruled out any possibility of life after the demise of the body. But more adventurous, thoughtful individuals still have the courage to open up this question. Not based on wishful thinking and dreams but on experiences. Either spontaneous happenings or aided by entheogenics or meditation.In this movie Jay Weidner has assembled a broad palete of viewpoints from some experts in the field. And spiced things up with some very aesthetic visuals and pleasing new age music to give a rather total experience. An experience that should leave no openminded viewer untouched.We have three time near-death suvivor Dannon Brinkley, the hypnotherapist Brian Weiss, the buddhists Dzogchen Ponlop and Robert Thurman. But the main characters are Neale Donald Walsh and Renate Dollinger. The first talking about an out-of-body experience, the later about her meetings with an angel ('dressed' as a R.A.F.-officer!). And while both have interesting stories to tell, it might not be spirituality at its 'highest'.And rather amazingly, Stan Grof - who might be considered the greatest (living) authority on the subject and whose books in this field ranks as classics - is only represented with two, very small clips. HisThe Ultimate Journey: Consciousness and the Mystery of Deathmay be the definitive work on this subject.Despite this rather strange weighting of the evidence the movie none the less presents a challenging and inspiring panorama over views on the after-life. Ranging from rather rose-coloured fantasies to Alberto Villoldo's view that we only have a limited number of chances before we get annihilated forever into the matrix from where we came.The view that might be missing is that of advanced forms of Eastern spirituality, that all this, even the notion of countless lifes and (re)incarnations, are only part of the dream of the One.",4,Life after death,1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,1919,"['ruling', 'scientific', 'paradigm', 'naive', 'belief', 'monistic', 'materialism', 'ruled', 'out', 'possibility', 'life', 'demise', 'body', 'more', 'adventurous', 'thoughtful', 'individuals', 'still', 'have', 'courage', 'open', 'up', 'question', 'Not', 'based', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'dreams', 'experiences', 'spontaneous', 'happenings', 'aided', 'entheogenics', 'meditation.In', 'movie', 'Jay', 'Weidner', 'assembled', 'broad', 'palete', 'viewpoints', 'experts', 'field', 'spiced', 'things', 'up', 'very', 'aesthetic', 'visuals', 'pleasing', 'new', 'age', 'music', 'give', 'rather', 'total', 'experience', 'experience', 'should', 'leave', 'openminded', 'viewer', 'untouched.We', 'have', 'three', 'time', 'near-death', 'suvivor', 'Dannon', 'Brinkley', 'hypnotherapist', 'Brian', 'Weiss', 'buddhists', 'Dzogchen', 'Ponlop', 'Robert', 'Thurman', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Neale', 'Donald', 'Walsh', 'Renate', 'Dollinger', 'first', 'talking', 'out-of-body', 'experience', 'later', 'meetings', 'angel', ""'dressed"", 'R.A.F.-officer', 'have', 'interesting', 'stories', 'tell', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'spirituality', ""'highest'.And"", 'rather', 'amazingly', 'Stan', 'Grof', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'greatest', 'living', 'authority', 'subject', 'books', 'field', 'classics', 'only', 'represented', 'two', 'very', 'small', 'clips', 'HisThe', 'Ultimate', 'Journey', 'Consciousness', 'Mystery', 'Deathmay', 'be', 'definitive', 'work', 'subject.Despite', 'rather', 'strange', 'weighting', 'evidence', 'movie', 'none', 'less', 'challenging', 'inspiring', 'panorama', 'views', 'after-life', 'Ranging', 'rather', 'rose-coloured', 'fantasies', 'Alberto', 'Villoldo', 'view', 'only', 'have', 'limited', 'number', 'chances', 'get', 'annihilated', 'forever', 'matrix', 'where', 'came.The', 'view', 'might', 'be', 'missing', 'advanced', 'forms', 'Eastern', 'spirituality', 'even', 'notion', 'countless', 'lifes', 're', 'incarnations', 'are', 'only', 'part', 'dream', 'One']",Infinity:The Ultimate Trip..

Their collective attempt to convey information about a complex topic dealing with the afterlife, though appreciated, fails miserably.  What bothers me about this video, almost to a degree of torture, are the excessive and highly distractive fractals appearing in the visual montages when one member of the cast, Neal Donald Walsh, monotonously and unconvincingly expresses (in a whispy voice) his own belief in life after death of the physical body.  The fractals are not only very annoying, but have nothing to do with the subject matter of the film.  The movie is about a fascinating topic, but its message is poorly delivered and its credibility is significantly diminished.

But for those who have some background knowledge and experience in these vitally important areas of understanding, this dvd is pure gold and a genuine delight for it's contributionof helping humanity come home to a fuller and more meaningful appreciation of the Truth behind the curtain of ignorance. After viewing it 3-4 times, I knew I had to send a copy to everyone close to meand if I could afford it, would send it to everyone I know. Not just for the information but for that type of information capable of freeing the mind from the bonds of ignorance.I was prepared to recieve this information due to my 40+ years of study and research based on my original question,'What is the Truth about life?'. That simple question elicited a response from the heart of universe and has taken me on a journey of discovery that I would never have imagined possible( Wait what? There really is a God? Unconditional Love is the True Nature of everyone and everything and we are One with this Being of Light,in fact That's who we are? Really? Woha, most everyone then has it completely up-side-down!).

You'll be the wiser and happier for it, without question!Some helpful companion dvd's are ""Home & Back"" and ""Round Trip"".
