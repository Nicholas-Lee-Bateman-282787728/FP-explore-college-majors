Pay phones-NO cells; no deleted expletives; VHS tape surveillance technology; and the film look of the late 70s--early 80s but its datedness is quickly forgotten THEN seen as a period political series with set-costume historic perfection. I lived the Nixon years (actually voted for him, OUCH!) This is powerful. Made me mad all over again, but also expect a compelling drive all the way to the 3 DVDs' end.SUBTITLES for all 6 feature-length episodes.One dialogue quote sums it up: ""It's just so vicious. There's so much back-biting and insincerity."" Perhaps too true in an election year. You may opt to stay away from the voter booth in favor of another viewing for this adaptation of Ehrlichman's book. Everyone knows the book and this series was about Nixon and Watergate. Author Ehrlichman was part of it. Like Haldeman, portrayed perfectly by Robert Vaughn under the fiction name of Flaherty, they did 18 months of jail time. Both the real man and Vaughn inspire disgust of politicians. Also giving such an astonishingly perfect performance that it makes a voter want to puke, was Nicholas Prior as Hank, anything-to-get-ahead boot-licker. And you'll be spitting nails at the see-saw politics of the CIA Director (Cliff Robertson plays Martin, but it was Helms in real Nixon life). Plenty of other stars like Jason Robards playing `Tricky Dick',President. I'm surprised congress didn't investigate the actor after the series, like they did the president--that convincing. Oh and who'd have thought Andy Griffith could play such a nasty former-Pres ESA (really LBJ)? Easy to spot Tessler (Harold Gould), or the real Kissinger, with German accent and dark frame glasses.Unfortunately, some really good acting by female leads of Stephanie Powers, Frances Lee McCain, Lois Nettleton, Meg Foster, and Lara Parker but Ehrlichman's book and the film script left all women looking like they served no purpose in DC other than sex objects and arm candy...wait, what's changed? Politics as usual, almost. It's not Disney!I remember refusing to read the books put out by the Nixon political crooks, didn't think they should benefit financially for what they did to the USA citizens. I did watch this ABC series. Good DVD to revisit. After 35 years this series appears to be a documentary for those of us who lived it, a history lesson for younger generations, and a lesson never learned by DC.

The arrogance and disregard for anything honorable and decent is what is shown here and the cast does a marvellous job in their respective assignments.

1531447,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B007ISJS8M,Jon Wynne,"[1, 1]","Revisiting TV programs from the 1970s invites comparison to what is being produced on television today. Shows like &#8220;The West Wing&#8221; have set a new standard for dramatizing politics. Yet a superior mini-series like WASHINGTON: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS holds up very well for any number of reasons: the timeless story that reminds us that absolute power corrupts absolutely; the incredible assembly of first-rate actors including Jason Robards and Robert Vaughn (who won an Emmy for his efforts); and the direction, which includes any number of impressive shots at a time when television production was still considered a static, rather than a visual, medium. What doesn&#8217;t hold up as well is the technical standard of production, which serves as a reminder of the wonders of the digital age. Some of the footage in WASHINGTON: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS is inevitably quite grainy.Fortunately, content trumps technical specifics every time, and the political machinations of WASHINGTON: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS make for some fascinating viewing.My first reaction as the story unfolded was &#8220;here comes another Hollywood Liberal Democratic indictment of Republicanism&#8221;, but as the storyline unfolded, it became clear the scope was not so narrow-minded. Although some of the effects, such as freeze frames, are dated, some unabashedly over-the-top performances propel the series into the realm of Greek Tragedy. There is genuine amazement, horror, remorse and hope for justice in the proceedings and this keeps the series from falling into the category of mere Democratic diatribe. Let&#8217;s face it, Nixon is an easy target. With source material written by one of the ex-president&#8217;s closest associates, even the most outlandish behaviour (the president&#8217;s paranoia, for example) is believable even while being eminently theatrical. Fortunately, the cumulative effect is more &#8220;look at what happened to our country and how much of it is still true&#8221; without painting so obvious a picture as a &#8220;Them VS Us&#8221; scenario, which, let&#8217;s be honest, would only satisfy about half the audience. The abuse of power on display is not about one particular party, it is rather a warning to us all that even in a free society, governments can and frequently do fail, especially when those at the top of the food chain are permitted to wallow in greed, paranoia and fear.The allusion to Greek Tragedy is appropriate, for taking this road of exploiting the obvious theatricality of the series elevates the story to a more neutral plain. Because of the delicate balancing act between theatrics and realism achieved by the director, this expert blending of stylistic choices does not prevent fine actors like Cliff Robertson from being wholly natural and believable. There is some beautifully nuanced work by him, Lois Nettleton and Harold Gould, especially, to name a few. Contrast this with Robards&#8217; theatricality, Vaughn&#8217;s Machiavellian manipulations and Nicholas Pryor&#8217;s whining simp of an &#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything to get ahead&#8221; character, and you&#8217;ve got a wide range of dramatic dynamics to keep things interesting.Less successful in the overtly theatrical front is Andy Griffith as a president modeled after the charismatic Lyndon B. Johnson. His performance in the role does not ring true. Griffith is an outstanding and beloved actor, but this time he misses the mark. Conversely, Stefanie Powers&#8217; character is underwritten. Her performance simply doesn&#8217;t register on this grand scale, preventing her from having any significant impact on the audience. Powers plays the mistress of Cliff Robertson. Eventually, when he returns to his wife it becomes clear that this sub-plot is a metaphor for &#8220;a country steered off course for awhile but finding its way back,&#8221; or, more simply, a return to values and morality. Ultimately it is a purely functional part and could have been played just as effectively by a no-name actress. Powers is as talented and beautiful as ever, but she is wasted in this role.American politics, it seems from this Canadian&#8217;s perspective, has always been about extremes. Perhaps this is inevitable with a two-party system. Polarization between the Republicans and Democrats was arguably never so extreme as during the double whammy crises of the Vietnam War and Watergate. This is fertile ground for drama and WASHINGTON: BEHIND CLOSES DOORS does not disappoint. Perhaps the timing of this DVD release by Acorn Media is appropriate to an election year. Question is, will current political scandal and intrigue turn out to be as interesting as that depicted in this long but rewarding mini-series?

Since I was living out of the country at that time, I didn't fully &#34;feel&#34; the impact it wrought, but this film really drives the point home retroactively.  It seems strange that John Ehrlichman would have written such a revealing story, when he was an integral part of the hypocrisy that regime carried out.Yes, a few situations were altered, but the frightening background was quite factual.  Jason Robards, Cliff Robertson, and Robert Vaughn, among others, turned out their customary outstanding performances.  You could say that the &#34;lovey'dovey&#34; affairs were a bit overdone throughout the entire miniseries.  Nevertheless, each of the various husband-wife-mistress messes was influenced by the political turmoil surrounding the characters.What amazes me is how a country could elect and re-elect such a man, considering the degree of disrespect evidenced by the public, so vividly described on screen.  We clearly had to be asleep at the switch.  I can well remember that just before Nixon's second election, Ralph Nader described his administration as being the most corrupt administation in U.S. history.  Although hardly anyone apparently listened, this was soon to be proven correct.I honestly feel that what I'm writing here is not overmingling fiction with fact.  This was a story that needed to be told, and has been done so far more clearly than the film Nixon managed to achieve -- without mentioning specific names, yet coming mighty close syllable-wise.If a movie studio should choose to produce a film describing Nazi Germany in its heyday, they wouldn't have to do much more than modify this one's script a bit and change the setting from Washington to Berlin.",5,Washington Behind Closed Doors,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,1781,"['excellent', 'terrifying', 'dramatic', 'parallel', 'Nixon', 'administration', 'was', 'living', 'country', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', '34', 'feel', '34', 'impact', 'wrought', 'film', 'really', 'point', 'home', 'retroactively', 'strange', 'John', 'Ehrlichman', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'revealing', 'story', 'when', 'was', 'integral', 'part', 'hypocrisy', 'carried', 'out.Yes', 'few', 'situations', 'were', 'altered', 'frightening', 'background', 'was', 'quite', 'factual', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'others', 'turned', 'out', 'customary', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'could', 'say', '34', '34', 'affairs', 'were', 'bit', 'overdone', 'entire', 'miniseries', 'Nevertheless', 'various', 'husband-wife-mistress', 'messes', 'was', 'influenced', 'political', 'turmoil', 'surrounding', 'characters.What', 'how', 'country', 'could', 'elect', 're-elect', 'such', 'man', 'considering', 'degree', 'disrespect', 'evidenced', 'public', 'so', 'vividly', 'described', 'screen', 'clearly', 'had', 'be', 'asleep', 'switch', 'can', 'well', 'remember', 'just', 'Nixon', 'second', 'election', 'Ralph', 'Nader', 'described', 'administration', 'being', 'most', 'corrupt', 'administation', 'U.S.', 'history', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'apparently', 'listened', 'was', 'soon', 'be', 'proven', 'correct.I', 'honestly', 'feel', 'what', ""'m"", 'writing', 'here', 'not', 'overmingling', 'fiction', 'fact', 'was', 'story', 'needed', 'be', 'told', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'far', 'more', 'clearly', 'film', 'Nixon', 'managed', 'achieve', 'mentioning', 'specific', 'names', 'yet', 'coming', 'mighty', 'close', 'syllable-wise.If', 'movie', 'studio', 'should', 'choose', 'produce', 'film', 'describing', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'heyday', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'modify', 'one', 'script', 'bit', 'change', 'setting', 'Washington', 'Berlin']",WASHINGTON: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
