The acting is done very well and there's a gentle & pastoral natural beauty to the film that is rather captivating. That being said, the number one criticism of other reviewers (even ones that gave it high ratings) is that the film is slow, very slow, and I couldn't agree more. In fact, I found that the tempo of the movie, apparently done on purpose to add a sense of escalating tension, so belabors the point that it shot itself in the foot and began feeling artificial. On top of this, we neither get much depth regarding the main characters nor do we see much in the way of character development. This isn't necessarily bad in some movies that have a singular point (action or horror movies perhaps), but here I found myself wishing for more knowledge & and intimacy with the leads, but the plot revealed next to nothing. This movie would've of worked far better as a short film.",3,Lots of good and lots of not good,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,947,"['found', 'movie', 'lacking', 'wanting', 'number', 'aspects', 'acting', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'gentle', 'pastoral', 'natural', 'beauty', 'film', 'rather', 'captivating', 'being', 'said', 'number', 'one', 'criticism', 'other', 'reviewers', 'even', 'ones', 'gave', 'high', 'ratings', 'film', 'slow', 'very', 'slow', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'more', 'fact', 'found', 'tempo', 'movie', 'apparently', 'done', 'purpose', 'add', 'sense', 'escalating', 'tension', 'belabors', 'point', 'shot', 'foot', 'began', 'feeling', 'artificial', 'top', 'neither', 'get', 'much', 'depth', 'regarding', 'main', 'characters', 'do', 'see', 'much', 'way', 'character', 'development', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'movies', 'have', 'singular', 'point', 'action', 'horror', 'movies', 'perhaps', 'here', 'found', 'wishing', 'more', 'knowledge', 'intimacy', 'leads', 'plot', 'revealed', 'next', 'nothing', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'far', 'better', 'short', 'film']",Hawaii
1670676,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00F878KAC,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[30, 31]","While looking for temporary summer work, Martin runs into a childhood friend, Eugenio, who hires him to do some odd jobs around his family&#8217;s house.  Eugenio seems attracted to Martin from the start, but is very insecure that the feeling is mutual.  They relive many of their childhood adventures, which becomes a bit of a courtship ritual.  They are both rather uneasy about the direction their relationship seems to be going, with Martin the more reluctant to admit his feelings as they surface.This is a very emotional and highly sexy film, focusing solely on these two characters and their growing feelings for each other.  It is certain to resonate with those who recall misgivings about their early attempts at cultivating a loving relationship, reconciling their sexuality, and fearing rejection from someone who has become an important part of their lives. There are no real secondary characters, and relatively little dialogue, with most of the communication of their feelings acted beautifully through their actions we see on screen.The film was made in Argentina, and actually has nothing to do with Hawaii (except a reference that both of them considered it a bit of a nirvana when they were kids).  Recommended as a refreshingly simple film about the complex matter of love and sexuality, from a filmmaker, Marco Berger, who seems to have nailed down that concept several times.  In Spanish with English subtitles, and would be a light R rating for sexual situations and brief nudity.  I give it a full five stars out of five.",5,"Beautiful, sexy story of two men falling in love",1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,1544,"['looking', 'temporary', 'summer', 'work', 'Martin', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Eugenio', 'who', 'do', 'odd', 'jobs', 'family', '8217', 's', 'house', 'Eugenio', 'attracted', 'Martin', 'start', 'very', 'insecure', 'feeling', 'mutual', 'relive', 'many', 'childhood', 'adventures', 'bit', 'courtship', 'ritual', 'are', 'rather', 'uneasy', 'direction', 'relationship', 'be', 'going', 'Martin', 'more', 'reluctant', 'admit', 'feelings', 'surface.This', 'very', 'emotional', 'highly', 'sexy', 'film', 'focusing', 'solely', 'two', 'characters', 'growing', 'feelings', 'other', 'certain', 'resonate', 'who', 'recall', 'misgivings', 'early', 'attempts', 'cultivating', 'loving', 'relationship', 'reconciling', 'sexuality', 'fearing', 'rejection', 'someone', 'who', 'become', 'important', 'part', 'lives', 'are', 'real', 'secondary', 'characters', 'relatively', 'little', 'dialogue', 'most', 'communication', 'feelings', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'actions', 'see', 'screen.The', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Argentina', 'actually', 'nothing', 'do', 'Hawaii', 'reference', 'considered', 'bit', 'nirvana', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'Recommended', 'refreshingly', 'simple', 'film', 'complex', 'matter', 'love', 'sexuality', 'filmmaker', 'Marco', 'Berger', 'who', 'have', 'nailed', 'down', 'concept', 'several', 'times', 'Spanish', 'English', 'subtitles', 'would', 'be', 'light', 'R', 'rating', 'sexual', 'situations', 'brief', 'nudity', 'give', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'five']",Hawaii

In my opinion, that scene should/could have been left on the editing floor.  After all this extraordinary set-up and pacing--kudos to the director--this scene was like a clump of wet manure in an otherwise pristine meadow. Why? It is not needed. The detail in showing us all we need to know is quite technical and beautiful and the actor's art of letting us see their thoughts is quite skillful.  You will remember Manuel Vignau from the movie, Plan B. He is an accomplished actor and skillfully threads his way through what could be very treacherous and unknown waters. After all, these two guys haven not seen each other for years...and you know what, I get why that scene I find unnecessary, is in the movie.  We see Eugenio's longing, but not his lust and all his previous conquests. Perhaps, the story teller wants us to know that for Eugenio, this thing with Martin is different from his past and the visiting friend is needed to let us in on Eugenio's usual M.O.

1670682,A3JYAX8BP7W3D2,B00F878KAC,Drew Odom,"[51, 55]","Part of the exceptional beauty of Marco Berger's Hawaii is its rhythm, the slow, deliberate, observant pace of its story.  But that  rhythm finds a counter rhythm in the frequent cuts from shot to shot.  Some linger, some come and go quickly.  Watching it, both in the experience of it at the moment and later in reflection, you become increasingly aware how much is being shown, how much you are witnessing.  The film is remarkable, among many other reasons, for the acuity of its eye, not only how much it sees, but how much detail is brought forth to ponder and feel.  Its clarity, in a profound sense, means something.The setting evokes in its light something of a pastoral world.  Only the two main characters really matter.  It is like a world elsewhere, where the outside world need not intrude. What this isolation allows for is enormous concentration.It is a two person film, with three other characters very briefly in it, only two of whom speak.  What the movie unfolds is the complexity of two men's falling in love.  But that complexity includes more than who they are.  It embraces the world in which they find themselves, the house, its pool, its lawns, trees, and flowers, the river near by.  It means that their pasts, who they once were together, also must be relived and revived.  As they work, together or separately, as they eat, as they talk, as they relax or compete or play, their feelings, their sensual responses to the world around them and to each other, are changing, intensifying.When such emotions are being aroused, slowly, often quietly, unsurely, deeply, perhaps surprisingly, the whole world matters.  It becomes more present.  The ""island"" of a sort where they find themselves together becomes more and more part of who they are.  That, I suppose, is one of the meanings of lyricism in film.Each shot in the movie has its own beauty.  Marco Berger is a film maker whose work is informed by a painterliness, not in the slightest bit arty or self-conscious, but clear, attentive, intense, where the whole composition enlightens the totality of its details.Desire makes the whole world around you more keenly present.  So it is in this film.  The story of these two men's becoming lovers involves all that surrounds them as well, especially memory which, more than in Berger's earlier work, plays a vital part in this movie and, in one instance, gives it its title.  Memory, among other values, is here restorative.  It becomes, in many senses, the means to return, the way to spare love the failures of loss.Sometimes, when a character is speaking, the movie goes silent.  You do not hear him.  Why that is so is as important as the dialogue you do hear.  How silence and words interplay in the film is nowhere more astonishing than in the significance of the word 'pineapple.'  Only a filmmaker of great sophistication and depth could have imagined this image and how it becomes so important to the movie, not only to its conclusion, but to the whole of it as you think back upon it or watch it again.  Both in words and in gestures much of the film resonates with what is not being said, in glances, in glimpses, in looking away, in looking back.The actors are as fine as the film in which they appear.  This is a great work.  That it is also a great act of gay film making is not incidental.  I think this might be one of the finest films about two men's falling in love ever made.  But there is no need to categorize.  It is a work of art that resists categorization.  That is part of its brilliance as an astonishingly beautiful and perfectly crafted movie.But it is also an unusually generous film, generous in its vision.  Its two men behave decently,  are good, and act to one another's benefit as much as or even more than for their own.  It is a film about gift-giving.  One character almost loses what he longs for, hopes for because he doesn't what to risk the other's happiness or future to get it.  The word 'good' can too easily collapse into moralism.  But the moral vision in this movie, its spirit of generosity, is at once both serious and elating.  This is an unusually fine movie, rare for its illuminations, its sensitivity to detail, its attention to the nuances of silence and gesture and to the richness of simple conversation, its sensual allure, and its ethical depth.  I felt, after watching it, elated.",5,"Astonishing, Beautiful",1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,4365,"['Part', 'exceptional', 'beauty', 'Marco', 'Berger', 'Hawaii', 'rhythm', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'observant', 'pace', 'story', 'rhythm', 'counter', 'rhythm', 'frequent', 'cuts', 'shot', 'shot', 'linger', 'come', 'go', 'quickly', 'Watching', 'experience', 'moment', 'later', 'reflection', 'become', 'increasingly', 'aware', 'how', 'much', 'being', 'shown', 'how', 'much', 'are', 'witnessing', 'film', 'remarkable', 'many', 'other', 'reasons', 'acuity', 'eye', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'much', 'how', 'much', 'detail', 'brought', 'forth', 'ponder', 'feel', 'clarity', 'profound', 'sense', 'something.The', 'setting', 'evokes', 'light', 'something', 'pastoral', 'world', 'Only', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'really', 'matter', 'world', 'elsewhere', 'where', 'outside', 'world', 'need', 'not', 'intrude', 'What', 'isolation', 'enormous', 'concentration.It', 'two', 'person', 'film', 'three', 'other', 'characters', 'very', 'briefly', 'only', 'two', 'whom', 'speak', 'What', 'movie', 'complexity', 'two', 'men', 'falling', 'love', 'complexity', 'more', 'who', 'are', 'world', 'find', 'house', 'pool', 'lawns', 'trees', 'flowers', 'river', 'pasts', 'who', 'once', 'were', 'together', 'also', 'must', 'be', 'relived', 'revived', 'work', 'together', 'separately', 'eat', 'talk', 'relax', 'compete', 'play', 'feelings', 'sensual', 'responses', 'world', 'other', 'are', 'changing', 'intensifying.When', 'such', 'emotions', 'are', 'being', 'aroused', 'slowly', 'often', 'quietly', 'unsurely', 'deeply', 'perhaps', 'surprisingly', 'whole', 'world', 'matters', 'more', 'present', 'island', 'sort', 'where', 'find', 'together', 'more', 'more', 'part', 'who', 'are', 'suppose', 'one', 'meanings', 'lyricism', 'film.Each', 'shot', 'movie', 'own', 'beauty', 'Marco', 'Berger', 'film', 'maker', 'work', 'informed', 'painterliness', 'not', 'slightest', 'bit', 'arty', 'self-conscious', 'clear', 'attentive', 'intense', 'where', 'whole', 'composition', 'totality', 'details.Desire', 'whole', 'world', 'more', 'keenly', 'present', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'becoming', 'lovers', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'memory', 'more', 'Berger', 'earlier', 'work', 'vital', 'part', 'movie', 'one', 'instance', 'title', 'Memory', 'other', 'values', 'here', 'restorative', 'many', 'senses', 'means', 'return', 'way', 'spare', 'love', 'failures', 'loss.Sometimes', 'when', 'character', 'speaking', 'movie', 'silent', 'do', 'not', 'hear', 'Why', 'so', 'as', 'important', 'dialogue', 'do', 'hear', 'How', 'silence', 'words', 'interplay', 'film', 'nowhere', 'more', 'astonishing', 'significance', 'word', 'Only', 'filmmaker', 'great', 'sophistication', 'depth', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'image', 'how', 'so', 'important', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'conclusion', 'whole', 'think', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'words', 'gestures', 'much', 'film', 'what', 'not', 'being', 'said', 'glances', 'glimpses', 'looking', 'away', 'looking', 'back.The', 'actors', 'are', 'as', 'fine', 'film', 'appear', 'great', 'work', 'also', 'great', 'act', 'gay', 'film', 'making', 'not', 'incidental', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'two', 'men', 'falling', 'love', 'ever', 'made', 'need', 'categorize', 'work', 'art', 'categorization', 'part', 'brilliance', 'astonishingly', 'beautiful', 'perfectly', 'crafted', 'movie.But', 'also', 'unusually', 'generous', 'film', 'generous', 'vision', 'two', 'men', 'behave', 'decently', 'are', 'good', 'act', 'one', 'benefit', 'as', 'much', 'even', 'more', 'own', 'film', 'gift-giving', 'One', 'character', 'almost', 'what', 'hopes', ""n't"", 'what', 'risk', 'other', 'happiness', 'future', 'get', 'word', 'can', 'too', 'easily', 'collapse', 'moralism', 'moral', 'vision', 'movie', 'spirit', 'generosity', 'once', 'serious', 'elating', 'unusually', 'fine', 'movie', 'rare', 'illuminations', 'sensitivity', 'detail', 'attention', 'nuances', 'silence', 'gesture', 'richness', 'simple', 'conversation', 'sensual', 'allure', 'ethical', 'depth', 'felt', 'watching', 'elated']",Hawaii
1670683,A1LX3GUBXMR3RS,B00F878KAC,FilmFoodie,"[1, 2]","Marco Berger's Spanish language Hawaii is small with a simple story made into something more than the narrative. Boy meets boy, boy becomes attracted to boy but doesn't know what to do about it, there's a history; what's going to happen? Berger uses long scenes of pause on scenery, character's processing, and body framing that evokes erotic tension, to evolve the story into an unfolding emotional journey. He's talented at using all the elements of film; character posturing, shot framing, scenery, music and dialogue to that result. The sparse dialogue incites and exhibits complication in human behavior rather than define everything. (Except a clumsy scene between Eugenio and a visiting relative where the dialogue makes perfectly clear the situation.) I read that disparity in character vocabulary is used to manifest class difference, which was lost in translation on me (subtitles ;-). Class or status is a component of the character's stories but I missed it as a struggle between them aside from Martin's shame of his situation. Intentional or not, Berger's themes are fodder for porn fantasy. However, he engages them as real world, contemplative journeys of discovery, though certainly sexually charged. Berger's use of eroticism is a bit obvious in this. Perhaps because I've seen his moves before, they stand out as a bit contrived. Berger might just be f****ng with you in using setups he's probably seen in porn and turning them into something else, there's no sex; he's a tease.I didn't get a powerful sense of chemistry between the leads. The guys are handsome real world types. Manuel Vignau gives Eugenio purpose and inner workings that make the character interesting. He projects charm and warmth. Mateo Chiarino's charming too. His angelic good looks and almost wide eyed innocence are engaging. He's good as the down on his luck Martin but he doesn't match Vignau's abilities so he's out classed in many scenes. Maybe intentional, but it made question any attraction beyond the physical.I suspect Marco Berger will be doing ""bigger"" things soon. I applaud him telling these small stories that he wants to tell. If you haven't seen his other films, you should. For me he's played out this toy box.

The long periods of silence and the long and lingering camera views communicate so much. The two characters in scenic settings makes a great home for this love story. And this film feels like falling in love in real time.The silence and lingering views directly correlate to the character's apprehension and thoughts about how to move forward and whether or not to reveal their feelings.  The silence and lingering views also invite the viewer in.Unlike an action-adventure Hollywood movie that keeps the viewer intentionally outside, Berger leaves time for his viewers to dive below the surface.  There is time to become part of Hawaii and to think about one's own reactions to what is going on in the film.There is subtle tension through much of the film when the viewer wonders if either Martin or Eugenia are operating with less than honorable intentions.  There is subtle proof that Martin is happiest in water based on his smile while swimming in the pool or river.Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the film is whether both characters are operating on 20 year old feelings from childhood attractions or whether the possibility of love is new. There is also each character's feelings developing on their own time table.  Eugenio seems ready for love when Martin is still questioning.  Then Martin provacatively exposes his body and Eugenio seemingly does not react.

Initially I was a tad disappointed as the first fifteen minutes of `scene setting' don't seem to go very far. Then it all changes and I was drawn in hook line and sinker.It is about Martin who is down on his luck and has returned to the area where he grew up but is surviving by doing odd jobs for a few pesos and food. He asks at the house of Eugenio, who is house sitting for his Aunt and Uncle, if there is any work and Eugenio tells him to come back tomorrow and he will see what he can do. What starts out as a handyman, soon turns into a passion of unrequited love that sees both men going on a journey of discovery.This film has a smouldering quality that makes you want something to happen to break the tension - a mood very reminiscent of `Absent'. Most of the action is concerned with the two male leads and yet it does not feel stifled for it - quite the opposite. It is well written, very well acted and thoughtfully filmed with some beautifully framed shots. It is in Spanish (Argentinean) with a run time of 102 minutes and had me captivated - so I can highly recommend especially if you liked Berger's earlier films.",5,Slow Burning Argentinian Bromance.,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,1268,"['Director', 'Marco', 'Berger', 'already', 'proven', 'can', 'make', 'great', 'cinema', 'Plan', 'B', 'Absent', 'was', 'expecting', 'great', 'things', 'Initially', 'was', 'tad', 'disappointed', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'scene', 'setting', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'very', 'far', 'Then', 'changes', 'was', 'drawn', 'hook', 'line', 'sinker.It', 'Martin', 'who', 'down', 'luck', 'returned', 'area', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'surviving', 'doing', 'odd', 'jobs', 'few', 'pesos', 'food', 'house', 'Eugenio', 'who', 'house', 'sitting', 'Aunt', 'Uncle', 'work', 'Eugenio', 'come', 'back', 'tomorrow', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'What', 'out', 'handyman', 'soon', 'passion', 'unrequited', 'love', 'men', 'going', 'journey', 'discovery.This', 'film', 'smouldering', 'quality', 'want', 'something', 'happen', 'break', 'tension', 'mood', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Absent', 'Most', 'action', 'concerned', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'yet', 'not', 'feel', 'stifled', 'quite', 'opposite', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'thoughtfully', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'framed', 'shots', 'Spanish', 'Argentinean', 'run', 'time', '102', 'minutes', 'had', 'captivated', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'especially', 'liked', 'Berger', 'earlier', 'films']",Hawaii

You know the ones: clich&eacute; coming out stories, drug addicted gay men selling their bodies, over the top queens who exist for their accessories or perhaps the worst, the preachy &#34;social message&#34; gay film that forgets what filmmaking is.  So maybe you've given up on &#34;gay&#34; films...I was almost there.  Then I discovered this film.  There was something in the description that made me want to risk two hours with the film, something that seemed to set it apart from the others.  And I'm certainly thrilled that I did.  The casting is superb.  They've chosen beautiful men who would never fit into a gay male underwear commercial; in other words, they've chosen men who can act.  The story is anything from complex.  It unfolds slowly, the tension building as the viewer gets glimpses of the passion underneath the surface.  The dialogue is sparse; the photography is rich.  There's nothing preachy here.  The films shows you; it never tells you.  It leaves you wanting more yet somehow fulfilled.  Take a chance on this one if you've given up hope on gay cinema!",5,Just when you've written off gay themed cinema,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,1192,"[""'re"", 'interested', 'film', 'bet', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'duds', 'American', 'gay', 'filmmakers', 'churn', 'out', 'know', 'ones', 'clich', 'eacute', 'coming', 'stories', 'drug', 'addicted', 'gay', 'men', 'selling', 'bodies', 'top', 'queens', 'who', 'exist', 'accessories', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'preachy', '34', 'social', 'message', '34', 'gay', 'film', 'what', 'filmmaking', 'So', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'given', 'up', '34', 'gay', '34', 'films', 'was', 'almost', 'there', 'Then', 'discovered', 'film', 'was', 'something', 'description', 'made', 'want', 'risk', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'something', 'seemed', 'set', 'apart', 'others', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'thrilled', 'did', 'casting', 'superb', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'beautiful', 'men', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'fit', 'gay', 'male', 'underwear', 'commercial', 'other', 'words', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'men', 'who', 'can', 'act', 'story', 'anything', 'complex', 'slowly', 'tension', 'building', 'viewer', 'glimpses', 'passion', 'surface', 'dialogue', 'sparse', 'photography', 'rich', 'nothing', 'preachy', 'here', 'films', 'never', 'wanting', 'more', 'yet', 'somehow', 'fulfilled', 'Take', 'chance', 'one', ""'ve"", 'given', 'up', 'hope', 'gay', 'cinema']",Hawaii
