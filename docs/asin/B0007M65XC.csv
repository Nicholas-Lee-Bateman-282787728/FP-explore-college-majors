I had read about it in the Times, and decided to look the film up and see if what the Times said was true.Immediately I became aware of one of two scenarios unfolding before me. Either GC Scott had produced, directed, and starred in a cinema vehicle for the sole purpose of showing off his new wife, or GC Scott had come across a script that he found so explosive that he could not resist but bring it to the screen.Only he would know, but I will tell you this...and I lived it so you can take this to the bank:  The theater I was in to view this movie was empty except for me and a few homeless guys getting in out of the weather. This movie had been showing to empty seats for about a month.  It was to run this way for an entire year (as best I recall).  Reason being, that when this movie came out, shagging your mother was not only a pile of dirty words, but unheard of in a physical context.  No theater wanted to show it.  The one's who had to show it contractually, got it in and out in no time.  Scott was furious. And asI said earlier,  either he loved the movie, or his wife (Trish VanDevere) wanted the publicity, because Scott bought every seat for every showing for every day for one year.Strangest thing, walking by there and this movie was playing to an empty theater forever.Now, thirty years later, I don't know for sure which way it was. All I can  tell you is this:  Good, bad, or just foolish, I have NEVER seen another movie that took this subject on, and to this day I can still recall  everything about this movie.Does that make it good?  You decide.",4,What price Glory?,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,1636,"['saw', 'movie', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'had', 'read', 'Times', 'decided', 'look', 'film', 'up', 'see', 'what', 'Times', 'said', 'was', 'true.Immediately', 'became', 'aware', 'one', 'two', 'scenarios', 'unfolding', 'GC', 'Scott', 'had', 'produced', 'directed', 'starred', 'cinema', 'vehicle', 'sole', 'purpose', 'showing', 'off', 'new', 'wife', 'GC', 'Scott', 'had', 'come', 'script', 'found', 'so', 'explosive', 'could', 'not', 'resist', 'bring', 'screen.Only', 'would', 'know', 'will', 'tell', 'lived', 'can', 'take', 'bank', 'theater', 'was', 'view', 'movie', 'was', 'empty', 'few', 'homeless', 'guys', 'getting', 'weather', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'showing', 'empty', 'seats', 'month', 'was', 'run', 'way', 'entire', 'year', 'best', 'recall', 'Reason', 'being', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'shagging', 'mother', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'pile', 'dirty', 'words', 'unheard', 'physical', 'context', 'theater', 'wanted', 'show', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'show', 'contractually', 'got', 'time', 'Scott', 'was', 'furious', 'asI', 'said', 'earlier', 'loved', 'movie', 'wife', 'Trish', 'VanDevere', 'wanted', 'publicity', 'Scott', 'bought', 'seat', 'showing', 'day', 'one', 'year.Strangest', 'thing', 'walking', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'empty', 'theater', 'forever.Now', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'way', 'was', 'can', 'tell', 'Good', 'bad', 'just', 'foolish', 'have', 'NEVER', 'seen', 'movie', 'took', 'subject', 'day', 'can', 'still', 'recall', 'everything', 'movie.Does', 'make', 'good', 'decide']",N/A

Initally hoping to be rescused, the mother tries to keep the child (a boy) civilized. When the child is almost killed, the father decides to teach him to survive in this harsh environment. He throws away the ABC blocks and instead teaches the boy to be a hunter. As time passes, the boy develops and develops sexual urges. Unfortunately, the ONLY outlet for his attraction is his MOTHER. He begins to view his father as a rival and attempts to kill him. The mother not wanting to see her husband or her son killed, consents at the end to become her son's lover. The end of the movie shows the bloodied father watching his wife kiss his son passionately.",2,Not the Swiss family Robinson,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,743,"['well', 'made', 'kind', 'Icky', 'movie', 'family', 'stranded', 'desert', 'island', '1800s', 'Initally', 'hoping', 'be', 'rescused', 'mother', 'keep', 'child', 'boy', 'civilized', 'When', 'child', 'almost', 'killed', 'father', 'teach', 'survive', 'harsh', 'environment', 'away', 'ABC', 'blocks', 'instead', 'boy', 'be', 'hunter', 'time', 'passes', 'boy', 'sexual', 'urges', 'Unfortunately', 'ONLY', 'outlet', 'attraction', 'MOTHER', 'view', 'father', 'rival', 'attempts', 'kill', 'mother', 'not', 'wanting', 'see', 'husband', 'son', 'killed', 'consents', 'end', 'become', 'son', 'lover', 'end', 'movie', 'bloodied', 'father', 'watching', 'wife', 'kiss', 'son', 'passionately']",N/A

Well, there's usually a reason for that...and that is, it's because it's NEVER BEEN RELEASED ON DVD YET!!!Now there's one sure-fire way to be certain of this, and that is...when you're on Amazon and miraculously you find whatever particular rarity you've been looking for on sale here:Look under the ""Product Details"" section...notice anything missing? Perhaps maybe a listing of the Studio that released the DVD? Well, that's what the seller of this movie is hoping you'd overlook, because about 98% of the time that omission means this is a bootleg copy of the film--unauthorized and most likely taken from a less than pristine source.Now speaking as someone who loves to collect rare films, I have nothing against obtaining a copy of a film, by whatever means necessary.  What I DO have an objection to is being a sold a copy of said film and being charged an arm and a leg to get it, especially when it's going to be a below average print...AND I'm being gouged to pay twenty bucks for it! It's commonplace all over the Internet--and at unknown sites you'll get unknown quality. But for Amazon to offer this kind of junk simply in the service of making a buck, is unconscionable.
