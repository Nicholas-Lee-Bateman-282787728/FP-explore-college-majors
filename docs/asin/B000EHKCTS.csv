Personally I almost did not make it past the first 5 minutes as I found some of the dialogue crude; after that though the movie was family friendly. The subtitles were good and ran at a nice readable pace.,3,Good but not great,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,329,"['movie', 'was', 'fun', 'definitely', 'not', 'favorites', 'Story', 'lines', 'was', 'predictable', 'cute', 'good', 'funny', 'moments', 'Personally', 'almost', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'found', 'dialogue', 'crude', 'movie', 'was', 'family', 'friendly', 'subtitles', 'were', 'good', 'ran', 'nice', 'readable', 'pace']",100 Days with Mr. Arrogant

It has a very sweet story about an unlikely encounter between a high school senior and a college student: featuring comical cinematic style and an equally unrealistic but absolutely perfect happy ending! Enjoy! (Although this is a story about a high school student, it has ADULT HUMOR and is intended for those of us who have lived those years already!)",5,"A really fun, enjoyable little story",1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,420,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'real', 'gem', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'twice', 'very', 'sweet', 'story', 'unlikely', 'encounter', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'college', 'student', 'featuring', 'comical', 'cinematic', 'style', 'equally', 'unrealistic', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'happy', 'ending', 'Enjoy', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'ADULT', 'HUMOR', 'intended', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'years', 'already']",100 Days with Mr. Arrogant

972670,A29KHUO0B70C0I,B000EHKCTS,"Sun ""Sun""","[0, 0]","Fast-paced and fun, if forgettable teenage romance. A high-school girl has a chance encounter with a rich college student, that leads to a minuscule scratch on the bumper of his fancy sports car. He demands 3 grand in compensation, and when she can't pay up, forces her to work as his ""slave"" for the next 100 days to pay off the debt. Eventually, the girl realizes she's being scammed - the damage is only about $20.00 worth - and turns the tables on him with a series of practical jokes. He retaliates by wangling a job as her tutor for the upcoming college entrance exams. Mutual antagonism turns to mutual attraction, and soon the pair are using their tutoring sessions as cover for sneaking out together...In Korean with English subtitles. Should be suitable for ages 12 up (some potty humor and mild swearing).",3,"Fun, if forgettable rom-com",1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,816,"['Fast-paced', 'fun', 'forgettable', 'teenage', 'romance', 'high-school', 'girl', 'chance', 'encounter', 'rich', 'college', 'student', 'minuscule', 'scratch', 'bumper', 'fancy', 'sports', 'car', '3', 'grand', 'compensation', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'up', 'work', 'slave', 'next', '100', 'days', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'Eventually', 'girl', 'being', 'scammed', 'damage', 'only', 'about', '20.00', 'worth', 'tables', 'series', 'practical', 'jokes', 'wangling', 'job', 'tutor', 'upcoming', 'college', 'entrance', 'exams', 'Mutual', 'antagonism', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'soon', 'pair', 'are', 'using', 'tutoring', 'sessions', 'cover', 'sneaking', 'out', 'together', 'Korean', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Should', 'be', 'suitable', 'ages', '12', 'up', 'potty', 'humor', 'mild', 'swearing']",100 Days with Mr. Arrogant
