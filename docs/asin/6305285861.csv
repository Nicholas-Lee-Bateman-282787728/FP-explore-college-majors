458154,A3USP7JY7U3TW2,6305285861,"Hizon ""Jerry""","[5, 5]","Thematically similar to films like Pulp Fiction and Snatch (although the storytelling is refreshingly simpler), Brother chronicles Danila's (Sergei Bodrov) experiences when he sets forth to the Big City, in this case, St. Petersburg. He hooks up with his brother (Viktor Sukhorukov) who works as a hitman in that city.  Interesting things happen when he agrees to take on a job originally contracted for his brother.And just like the two aforementioned films, Brother explores the seedy/sleazy underbelly of a big city by having Danila interact with various colorful characters.Told in little vignettes with each scene fading in and out from black, director Alexei Balabanov gives us an involving narrative about the roguish Danila. Although he doesn't hesitate to cap other lowlifes (and a married woman's husband), use drugs, he goes out of his way to help and befriend the defenseless and protect those not involved in one of their contracts.  His code of honor makes him some sort of Russian Wise Guy/Robin Hood.The movie also gives us a glimpse of post-Soviet Russia and how the West and its capitalist values has encroached the former Communist stronghold.  That (and the endearing performance of the actors, especially Sergei Budrov) makes the film worth watching, since the plotline is basically  a well-trodden path in Hollywood and British gangster cinema.So if you're waiting for a Hollywood remake, don't. It isn't as groundbreaking as Hong Kong films, but with a liberal dose of grittiness, black humor and a not-your-usual-locale charm, it is still a very entertaining piece of world cinema.",4,Pulp Fictionski?,1101340800,"11 25, 2004",2004,1605,"['Thematically', 'similar', 'films', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Snatch', 'storytelling', 'refreshingly', 'simpler', 'Brother', 'Danila', 'Sergei', 'Bodrov', 'when', 'forth', 'Big', 'City', 'case', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'up', 'brother', 'Viktor', 'Sukhorukov', 'who', 'hitman', 'city', 'Interesting', 'things', 'happen', 'when', 'take', 'job', 'originally', 'contracted', 'brother.And', 'just', 'two', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'Brother', 'seedy/sleazy', 'underbelly', 'big', 'city', 'having', 'Danila', 'interact', 'various', 'colorful', 'characters.Told', 'little', 'vignettes', 'scene', 'fading', 'black', 'director', 'Alexei', 'Balabanov', 'involving', 'narrative', 'roguish', 'Danila', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'cap', 'other', 'lowlifes', 'married', 'woman', 'husband', 'use', 'drugs', 'way', 'help', 'befriend', 'defenseless', 'protect', 'not', 'involved', 'one', 'contracts', 'code', 'honor', 'sort', 'Russian', 'Wise', 'Guy/Robin', 'Hood.The', 'movie', 'also', 'glimpse', 'post-Soviet', 'Russia', 'how', 'West', 'capitalist', 'values', 'encroached', 'former', 'Communist', 'stronghold', 'endearing', 'performance', 'actors', 'especially', 'Sergei', 'Budrov', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'plotline', 'basically', 'well-trodden', 'path', 'Hollywood', 'British', 'gangster', 'cinema.So', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'do', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'as', 'groundbreaking', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'films', 'liberal', 'dose', 'grittiness', 'black', 'humor', 'not-your-usual-locale', 'charm', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'world', 'cinema']",Brother VHS

How easy it is in that world for a young man with no education and employment prospects?  It is not easy, so his mother sends him off to Leningrad (St. Petersburg) to get a job with his older brother's help.

He makes friends in unlikely places with unlikely people who in many ways are outcasts like him.  No matter how troubling our young protagonist is, we just cannot but love the man who is a cross over between Robin Hood and a new brand of rebel without cause.  A complete gem of a movie.

But in the rest of the world, Balabanov has been an underground sensation for years. His third feature, &lt;em>Brat&lt;/em> (released in English-speaking countries as &lt;em>Brother&lt;/em>), took home a raft of awards in 1997-98 and marked him as a director to watch in countries from Canada to Italy. Even the Chicago film critics took notice, handing the late Sergey Bodrov Jr. a Best Actor award and nominating it for Best Film (it lost to Alan Rickman's &lt;em>The Winter Guest&lt;/em>), but Chicago, alas, does not seem to have the draw of New york or LA when it comes to putting names in front of people, and so we in America forgot about Aleksey Balabanov for a decade. More fool us.&lt;em>Brother&lt;/em> tells the story of Danila Bagrov (&lt;em>War&lt;/em>'s Sergey Bodrov Jr., tragically killed in an avalanche while scouting scenes for a film at the age of thirty), an Army clerk who's trying to transition to civvie life. After a quick, unsuccessful try living with his mother, he ends up traveling to St. Petersburg to visit his brother (&lt;em>The Island&lt;/em>'s Viktor Sukhorukov), known in the film only as The Tatar. Mom says he's doing well for himself up there, and Danila soon finds out that's the case--The Tatar is a freelance hitman, currently being targeted by his own boss, known as Roundhead, for being too greedy. The Tatar subcontracts the assassination of The Chechen, a former terrorist now horning in on Roundhead's protection racket, to Danila, who takes the job, needing some quick cash. This gets him in deep with Roundhead, who's found himself not only someone else to kill, but a potentially valuable subcontractor as well. Meanwhile, Danila has also made himself something of a name for dispensing vigilante justice, earning the friendships of various homeless folks, drug dealers, and the like, all of whom form a loose, unofficial network helping him out. And just to make things a little more complicated, he also finds himself sliding into a possible love triangle with tram driver Sveta (Balabanov regular Svetlana Pismichenko), who helped him escape the scene after the Chechen job, and Kat (Mariya Zhukova in her only screen appearance), a local party girl who offers a means of temporary escape from the stresses of Danila's quotidian existence.It's complex, it's cerebral, and it's a good deal of fun. Balabanov got better as a filmmaker as time went on (here, he's way too fond of the overly-dramatic fadeout), but you can see how good he is at getting the best out of his cast and how good he is at pacing what could have easily been an all-too-boring film. &lt;em>Brother&lt;/em> is anything but, and an excellent document of the early career of a director who just keeps getting better and better. *** ",4,Solid low-budget indie gem from a rising star.,1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,3121,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Brat', 'lt', '>', 'Aleksey', 'Balabanov', '1997', 'Aleksey', 'Balabanov', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'become', 'known', 'America', '2007', 'when', 'lt', '>', 'Gruz', '200', 'lt', '>', 'kicked', 'off', 'extended', 'depending', 'consider', 'Andrey', 'Iskanov', 'lt', '>', 'Nails', 'lt', '>', 'part', 'new', 'wave', 'Russian', 'absurdist', 'filmmaking', 'produced', 'true', 'gems', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'rest', 'world', 'Balabanov', 'been', 'underground', 'sensation', 'years', 'third', 'feature', 'lt', '>', 'Brat', 'lt', '>', 'released', 'English-speaking', 'countries', 'lt', '>', 'Brother', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'took', 'home', 'raft', 'awards', '1997-98', 'marked', 'director', 'watch', 'countries', 'Canada', 'Italy', 'Even', 'Chicago', 'film', 'critics', 'took', 'notice', 'handing', 'late', 'Sergey', 'Bodrov', 'Jr.', 'Best', 'Actor', 'award', 'nominating', 'Best', 'Film', 'lost', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'lt', '>', 'Winter', 'Guest', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Chicago', 'alas', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'draw', 'New', 'york', 'LA', 'when', 'putting', 'names', 'front', 'people', 'so', 'America', 'forgot', 'Aleksey', 'Balabanov', 'decade', 'More', 'fool', 'us.', 'lt', '>', 'Brother', 'lt', '>', 'story', 'Danila', 'Bagrov', 'lt', '>', 'War', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Sergey', 'Bodrov', 'Jr.', 'tragically', 'killed', 'avalanche', 'scouting', 'scenes', 'film', 'age', 'thirty', 'Army', 'clerk', 'who', 'trying', 'transition', 'civvie', 'life', 'quick', 'unsuccessful', 'try', 'living', 'mother', 'up', 'traveling', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'visit', 'brother', 'lt', '>', 'Island', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Viktor', 'Sukhorukov', 'known', 'film', 'only', 'Tatar', 'Mom', 'doing', 'well', 'there', 'Danila', 'soon', 'out', 'case', 'Tatar', 'freelance', 'hitman', 'currently', 'being', 'targeted', 'own', 'boss', 'known', 'Roundhead', 'being', 'too', 'greedy', 'Tatar', 'assassination', 'Chechen', 'former', 'terrorist', 'now', 'horning', 'Roundhead', 'protection', 'racket', 'Danila', 'who', 'job', 'needing', 'quick', 'cash', 'deep', 'Roundhead', 'who', 'found', 'not', 'only', 'someone', 'else', 'kill', 'potentially', 'valuable', 'subcontractor', 'well', 'Meanwhile', 'Danila', 'also', 'made', 'something', 'name', 'dispensing', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'earning', 'friendships', 'various', 'homeless', 'folks', 'drug', 'dealers', 'like', 'whom', 'form', 'loose', 'unofficial', 'network', 'helping', 'out', 'just', 'make', 'things', 'little', 'more', 'complicated', 'also', 'sliding', 'possible', 'love', 'triangle', 'tram', 'driver', 'Sveta', 'Balabanov', 'regular', 'Svetlana', 'Pismichenko', 'who', 'helped', 'escape', 'scene', 'Chechen', 'job', 'Kat', 'Mariya', 'Zhukova', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'local', 'party', 'girl', 'who', 'means', 'temporary', 'escape', 'stresses', 'Danila', 'quotidian', 'existence.It', 'complex', 'cerebral', 'good', 'deal', 'fun', 'Balabanov', 'got', 'better', 'filmmaker', 'time', 'went', 'here', 'way', 'too', 'fond', 'overly-dramatic', 'fadeout', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'good', 'getting', 'best', 'cast', 'how', 'good', 'pacing', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'all-too-boring', 'film', 'lt', '>', 'Brother', 'lt', '>', 'anything', 'excellent', 'document', 'early', 'career', 'director', 'who', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'better', '***']",Brother VHS

Our hero turns on a tough guy performance 'par excellence'.  Balabanov's direction is taut and memorable.  I particularly liked the 'fade to black' between sequences over the sudden 'quick as a blink' style so popular.This is not a film for the squeamish despite the absence of the vile graphic depictions in American films of this genre.",4,BROTHER,1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,726,"['BROTHER', 'Alexei', 'Balabanov', 'cover', 'stylish', 'gangster', 'film', 'set', 'St', 'Petersburgh', 'Soviets', 'are', 'falling', 'grace', 'state', 'anarchy', 'Sergei', 'Bodrov', 'Jr.', 'part', 'soldier', 'returning', 'National', 'Service', 'was', 'boring', 'office', 'job', 'something', 'somewhat', 'more', 'sinister', '.He', 'elder', 'brother', 'only', 'find', 'enmeshed', 'life', 'crime', 'murder', 'hero', 'tough', 'guy', 'performance', ""'par"", 'excellence', 'Balabanov', 'direction', 'taut', 'memorable', 'particularly', 'liked', ""'fade"", 'black', 'sequences', 'sudden', ""'quick"", 'blink', 'style', 'popular.This', 'not', 'film', 'squeamish', 'absence', 'vile', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'American', 'films', 'genre']",Brother VHS

Danilla is a 23 year old kid just released from Russian military service. After loafing around his home town for a while, he travels to St. Petersburg to hook up with his older brother. But guess what: The brother is a mafia wiseguy, and he puts Dannila to work as a contract hitman. Weren't expecting that, were you?What I loved about Brother is that Danilla is basically just a kid wants to get drunk, get laid, and listen to his favorite rock band. His responsibilities as a mafia hitman constantly get in the way of having a good time. It was as if he were working at McDonalds, and just wanted to get his shift over with so he could go party. There is something carefree and beautiful about the Danilla character, in spite of the fact that he is a killer and  an anti-semite. You can forgive all sorts of character flaws when someone is still young and trying to figure life out. Strictly from the picture on the DVD cover, one might assume that there is a HIGH probabibility that Brother is just another crappy shootem up action/mafia movie. What I saw was an excellent depiction of what its like to be in your early 20s - with performances even non-Russian audiences will appreciate.",5,Unexpectedly Good,1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,1329,"['Brother', 'was', 'one', 'low', 'budget', 'action', 'succeeded', 'odds', 'story', 'was', 'simple', 'yet', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'Danilla', '23', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'just', 'released', 'Russian', 'military', 'service', 'loafing', 'home', 'town', 'while', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'hook', 'up', 'older', 'brother', 'guess', 'what', 'brother', 'mafia', 'wiseguy', 'Dannila', 'work', 'contract', 'hitman', 'Were', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'were', 'What', 'loved', 'Brother', 'Danilla', 'basically', 'just', 'kid', 'get', 'drunk', 'get', 'laid', 'listen', 'favorite', 'rock', 'band', 'responsibilities', 'mafia', 'hitman', 'constantly', 'get', 'way', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'was', 'were', 'working', 'McDonalds', 'just', 'wanted', 'get', 'shift', 'could', 'go', 'party', 'something', 'carefree', 'beautiful', 'Danilla', 'character', 'spite', 'fact', 'killer', 'anti-semite', 'can', 'forgive', 'sorts', 'character', 'flaws', 'when', 'someone', 'still', 'young', 'trying', 'figure', 'life', 'Strictly', 'picture', 'DVD', 'cover', 'one', 'might', 'assume', 'HIGH', 'probabibility', 'Brother', 'just', 'crappy', 'shootem', 'up', 'action/mafia', 'movie', 'What', 'saw', 'was', 'excellent', 'depiction', 'what', 'like', 'be', 'early', '20s', 'performances', 'even', 'non-Russian', 'audiences', 'will', 'appreciate']",Brother VHS

458168,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,6305285861,Tommy Dooley,"[1, 1]","This is billed as a Russian `Pulp Fiction', I beg to differ and actually like both films, but this sort of stays with you and is more real. It stars Sergei Bodrov as Daniel, who has just been discharged from the Russian army. After he gets into a slight fracas with some film security guards, his rather earthy looking mother tells him to go and be with her `little Viktor' in Leningrad. He is the one thing the family has to be proud of, as her no good husband managed to go and die in prison - typical.Well off he goes buying new music along the way to play in his Disc Man. On arrival he runs into a poor German trying to sell some pitiful wares in a rather down market flea market. He introduces himself as Hoffman, but Dani calls him `German' throughout. He has some more encounters where he seems to be a sort of Robin Hood attitude, doing good for good people. When he finally tracks the saintly Victor down it sort of become obvious rather quick that his halo has somewhat slipped and he is now a hit man for the mafia, well can't win em all can you? But Dani has always looked up to his brother, so when he suggests entering the 'family business', Dani agrees without much conscience wrangling. He claims to have been a clerk in the army, missing out on all the actual fighting. If that is the case then the Russian army training videos must be rather good, as he just takes to his new `job' like a duck to water.The music is very urban and keeps surprising you throughout and there is a love interest too, whic moves the plot along nicely.I do not want to give the plot away as this 1 hour 35 minute film really speeds by, there are only good performances, the violence is often, but not gratuitous and thoroughly believable, not over the top gore or cool shoot outs, but messy and very human. Great points I like from this film, they say `Hello' when they answer the phone (like the French ) they played faded glam rockers `Slade' at a `cool' party and do all live on vodka, something we thought was propaganda. Seriously this is a brilliant piece of world and more over Russian cinema. It was made in 1997, but is still relevant and a must see for world cinema fans.",5,"Guns, Vodka, Music, Vodka and some ruddy good violence!",1305244800,"05 13, 2011",2011,2178,"['billed', 'Russian', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'beg', 'differ', 'actually', 'films', 'sort', 'stays', 'more', 'real', 'Sergei', 'Bodrov', 'Daniel', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'discharged', 'Russian', 'army', 'slight', 'fracas', 'film', 'security', 'guards', 'rather', 'earthy', 'looking', 'mother', 'go', 'be', 'little', 'Viktor', 'Leningrad', 'one', 'thing', 'family', 'be', 'proud', 'good', 'husband', 'managed', 'go', 'die', 'prison', 'typical.Well', 'buying', 'new', 'music', 'way', 'play', 'Disc', 'Man', 'arrival', 'poor', 'German', 'trying', 'sell', 'pitiful', 'wares', 'rather', 'down', 'market', 'flea', 'market', 'Hoffman', 'Dani', 'German', 'more', 'encounters', 'where', 'be', 'sort', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'attitude', 'doing', 'good', 'good', 'people', 'When', 'finally', 'saintly', 'Victor', 'sort', 'become', 'obvious', 'rather', 'quick', 'halo', 'somewhat', 'slipped', 'now', 'hit', 'man', 'mafia', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'em', 'can', 'Dani', 'always', 'looked', 'up', 'brother', 'so', 'when', 'entering', ""'family"", 'business', 'Dani', 'much', 'conscience', 'wrangling', 'have', 'been', 'clerk', 'army', 'missing', 'out', 'actual', 'fighting', 'case', 'then', 'Russian', 'army', 'training', 'videos', 'must', 'be', 'rather', 'good', 'just', 'new', 'job', 'duck', 'water.The', 'music', 'very', 'urban', 'surprising', 'love', 'interest', 'too', 'whic', 'plot', 'nicely.I', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'plot', 'away', '1', 'hour', '35', 'minute', 'film', 'really', 'speeds', 'are', 'only', 'good', 'performances', 'violence', 'often', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'thoroughly', 'believable', 'not', 'top', 'gore', 'cool', 'shoot', 'outs', 'messy', 'very', 'human', 'Great', 'points', 'like', 'film', 'say', 'Hello', 'when', 'answer', 'phone', 'French', 'played', 'faded', 'glam', 'rockers', 'Slade', 'cool', 'party', 'do', 'live', 'vodka', 'something', 'thought', 'was', 'propaganda', 'Seriously', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'world', 'more', 'Russian', 'cinema', 'was', 'made', '1997', 'still', 'relevant', 'must', 'see', 'world', 'cinema', 'fans']",Brother VHS
