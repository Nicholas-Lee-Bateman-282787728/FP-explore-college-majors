I love the concept and the way Amy Allan is so dedicated to her task--really keeps herself out of it as much as possible and goes through a lot in order to help people and places undergoing paranormal activity.

I don't know, but I really enjoy this show because it's not silly and crappy like a lot of other paranormal shows out now.  Steve is awesome, straight forward and simple, Amy is more out of the box and extremely interesting. I always watch the show at night! Scary!

This is perfect since you get to see some history and then find out what Amy is hearing from the spirts still waiting around. I know so many people are saying this stuff is fake and that is fine, but I enjoy watching it anyway. What better way to spend some time on a weekend then hanging around the tv watching shadow people or what ever speaking to Amy while we watch Steve hunt down the history of what happened in years past to the building or land around a hunted place.

I believe this is one of them here is why, 1 Amy often tells clients tarot cards are bad and  lure evil spirits to your home. This is fear based hogwash and any one that actually learned how to read them knows this is not true. Tarot cards don't rely on spirits unless you call on spirits. Mostly they rely on your higher self. 2, she told a client her Reiki pratice was wrong. Why would an evil spirit be drawn to positive healing energy? It wouldn't it would flee.She uses voodo tar water, has recomended a wiccan for one house, a medicine man for another, a catholic execercisim for another.Basically Amy can be a psyic and an expert in all things psyic and you can't.
