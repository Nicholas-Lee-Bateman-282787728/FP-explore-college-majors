343049,A1NW29BQR0ODAF,6302878527,A. Carmack,"[16, 19]","The past month I have been watching every Audrey Hepburn movie available... She has always been one of my favorite actresses, and 5 years ago I realized she was my all-time favorite: she has endeared herself to me in her most well-known films such as My fair Lady, Breakfast at Tiffany's, and Roman Holiday (all of which I love).But I have also been viewing her lesser-known films, such as The Nun's Story (excellent), Children's Hour (excellent), and -- most recently -- ""Two for the Road.""When I first rented the movie, I had =no= idea what to expect, so at first I was a bit surprised and let down that the relationship that Hepburn's character (Joanna Wallace) has with the leading male is not all sweet and sugary such as that in Roman Holiday.  In fact, the relationship she has with Albert Finney's character (Mark Wallace) is ""basically volatile"" -- as Wallace's friend and ex-lover points out -- and is filled with ""sniping"" and mutual loathing--at least by the time they have been married for ten years.However, by the time the film was over, I realized it was the most realistic movie about the vicissitudes of long-term relationships that I had ever watched. And that I would be recommending this little-known film to all my friends, especially my married and divorced ones (i.e., I think one has to have been married and/or divorced to =really= appreciate the film, although other reviewers have pointed out that they were single when they first viewed it and that it made a lasting  impression on them).I myself was married 2 weeks shy of 14 years (in a very volatile relationship), and to me this film is ""spot on"" when it comes to portraying the different phases that many long-term relationships go through: the first months of almost absolute bliss; the early, pre-child years, when the arguments that occur only presage later, more serious ones; the years when a child only adds stress to a relationship already at a breaking point; the 6th-8th year when the couple can't stand each other; [the whole 7-year itch factor];  to the 10th-12th year when the couple still cannot stand each other, only pretend to be happily married, but stay together because ""it is worth it sometimes,"" and because they discover they need each other.  As Finney's character wryly remarks: If there is one thing I really despise is an ""indispensible woman.""I give ""Two for the Road"" 4 out of 5 stars.  The performance by Hepburn is extraordinary--given that she convincingly plays the same woman, Joanna Wallace, over a 12-year period, varying between a 20-something fresh youth who is ""three-dimensional as it happens"" -- Viewers of the film will recognize that quote -- to a thirty-something mother-with-child (""pregnant sow"").The film abounds with such wry remarks, excellent editing (making the film a bit tricky to follow, but which in turn adds to the pleasure of mulitple viewing).Other reviewers have mentioned that the scenes cut between four different ""road trips"" that Mark and Joanna Wallace make, but in my count there are at least five:(a) the one where they first meet and fall in love when hitchiking;(b) the one where they are newlyweds travelling with friends of Mark (the American couple with a bratty daughter);(c) the one where they are in the ""old MG"" [green car] (and eventually meet Maurice, Mark's soon-to-be all-consuming employer);(d) the one where they are travelling together with their own daughter: on the road and in the hotel where the boiled egg doesn't arrive;(e) the one where they are travelling without their daughter, en route to meet Maurice; the trip that starts and ends the movie;Hepburn's acting was superb, while Finney's was enjoyable.  His character hardly changes in appearance over the 10-12 years, and his imitation of Humphrey Bogart is weak and therefore unnecessary.  But he does deliver his lines well if somewhat too laconically.Memorable quotes abound from this film, as in Breakfast at Tiffany's (which remains my favorite of Hepburn films)...----""We agreed before we got married we weren't going to have children,"" says Finney's character.----""And before we were married, we didn't,"" slyly retorts Hepburns' character.The dialogue is as catchy as the editing and the acting.4 out 5:  Even though I am a huge Audrey Hepburn fan, and even though the movie is one of her best... still it is probably not (yet) in my top fifty movies of all time...well, maybe #50.  (There are an awful lot of movies out there!)But I would still say that it is the most realistic film about relationships that I have seen, and certainly the most realistic film about relationships that Hepburn stars in.  And ""star in"" she does in ""Two for the Road"": as in most her movies, her personality and--in this case-- her superb acting *make* the movie.  She plays the gamut of absolute giddyness to the depths of grief in a very believeable and touching manner.I plan to purchase the film for multiple viewings.  And it is a definite ""must see"" and ""must have"" for Hepburn fans.",4,A must see---A must buy!,1079308800,"03 15, 2004",2004,5005,"['past', 'month', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn',

343055,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302878527,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","A lot of directors have tried to capture the delicate unraveling of a marriage, but few ever seem to be able to capture ever angle to the astute wonderment and honesty of `Two for the Road'.  A film that appears, on the outset, to be rather chaotic and uneven comes together in a beautifully robust telling of marital follies and the reuniting of spirit.I think that is the most beautiful aspect of the film's obvious themes, that reuniting of spirit, for it allows the audience to find hope and charm in the film's depiction of this marriage on the rocks.  By giving us interwoven vignettes that show us the beginning, middle and end (or is it the end?) of this relationship, we are able to see how time has affected their lives and how similar situations, spaced years apart, carry a very different connotation.  I love the balance here.  While it may appear to some that Marc is the aggressor here, as one watches all the details unfold it really becomes clear that this is a very well balanced portrayal of two people causing hurt and attempting reconciliation at various times and to various degrees.  No one is the chief aggressor or victim, and that to me shows an honest and unbiased look at marriage in general, since no problem is solely one person's fault.It just doesn't happen that way.Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney are at the tip top of their game here, delivering stunning performances that dig down deep and show us so many shades of character.  Portraying a couple at three different stages of their relationship, there is a lot of develop and they do so effortlessly.  Hepburn in particular possesses so much girlish charm, commanding the screen as a youthful choir girl (convincingly played, despite the fact that she was well into her 30's at the time) and then falling right into middle age and motherhood without a single hitch.  Finney bounds along with so much commanding presence, playing up his rugged good looks and booming voice while exuding charm that would make Cary Grant blush with jealously.Simply a flawless film that will make you laugh, cry and smile, sometimes simultaneously.",5,One of the best films about marriage...,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,2117,"['lot', 'directors', 'have', 'tried', 'capture', 'delicate', 'unraveling', 'marriage', 'few', 'ever', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'capture', 'ever', 'angle', 'astute', 'wonderment', 'honesty', 'Two', 'Road', 'film', 'outset', 'be', 'rather', 'chaotic', 'uneven', 'together', 'beautifully', 'robust', 'telling', 'marital', 'follies', 'reuniting', 'spirit.I', 'think', 'most', 'beautiful', 'aspect', 'film', 'obvious', 'themes', 'reuniting', 'spirit', 'audience', 'find', 'hope', 'charm', 'film', 'depiction', 'marriage', 'rocks', 'giving', 'interwoven', 'vignettes', 'show', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'end', 'relationship', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'how', 'time', 'affected', 'lives', 'how', 'similar', 'situations', 'spaced', 'years', 'apart', 'carry', 'very', 'different', 'connotation', 'love', 'balance', 'here', 'may', 'appear', 'Marc', 'aggressor', 'here', 'one', 'details', 'unfold', 'really', 'clear', 'very', 'well', 'balanced', 'portrayal', 'two', 'people', 'causing', 'hurt', 'attempting', 'reconciliation', 'various', 'times', 'various', 'degrees', 'one', 'chief', 'aggressor', 'victim', 'honest', 'unbiased', 'look', 'marriage', 'general', 'problem', 'solely', 'one', 'person', 'fault.It', 'just', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way.Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'are', 'tip', 'top', 'game', 'here', 'delivering', 'stunning', 'performances', 'dig', 'down', 'deep', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'shades', 'character', 'Portraying', 'couple', 'three', 'different', 'stages', 'relationship', 'lot', 'develop', 'do', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'Hepburn', 'particular', 'possesses', 'so', 'much', 'girlish', 'charm', 'commanding', 'screen', 'youthful', 'choir', 'girl', 'convincingly', 'played', 'fact', 'was', 'well', '30', 'time', 'then', 'falling', 'right', 'middle', 'age', 'motherhood', 'single', 'hitch', 'Finney', 'along', 'so', 'much', 'commanding', 'presence', 'playing', 'up', 'rugged', 'good', 'looks', 'booming', 'voice', 'exuding', 'charm', 'would', 'make', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'blush', 'jealously.Simply', 'flawless', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'smile', 'sometimes', 'simultaneously']",N/A

343061,A3F8U4CRMDLY2T,6302878527,CHUCK WEST,"[10, 13]","&quot;TWO FOR THE ROAD&quot; is a very good movie about what happens when the fairy tale ends and the couple &quot;lives happily ever after.&quot; The film consists of four vignettes, in- and out-of- sequence, about a  stylish, economically-upwardly-mobile British couple on four different road  trips on the same road through France at different stages of their  relationship. The first, in their real time, is a trip as youths when they  meet and fall in love. The second is as struggling newlyweds. The third is  after both have had affairs. In the fourth, they have achieved financial  success, but the decay in their marriage has led to a downward spiral of  emotions. Instead of appearing in chronological sequence, the four  vignettes are edited/spliced together, jumping from trip to trip, for  contrast and to show coordinated alignment of thoughts, actions and  revelations. There's beautiful rural French scenery, a lovely Henry Mancini  score, brilliant dialogue, and some of the greatest 60's mod fashions ever  seen on film. In one particularly pivotal scene, Audrey Hepburn storms off  from the car wearing a black shiny-vinyl mod pantsuit. Walking alongside a  lake, she delivers the most clarifying line in the film, &quot;you don't  give me 'everything I want'; you give me everything YOU WANT TO GIVE  ME! &quot; This line speaks volumes for all couples everywhere who have  been tortured by the miscommunications, mistreatments, and misperceptions  involved with trying to love another. Odd that a line that hits the nail on  the head, so poignantly and seriously, comes from Audrey's character when  looking like Joanne Worley on an episode of &quot;Laugh-In&quot; a few  years later. Another laughable sequence is the one with the couple's  friends' spoiled daughter. Apparently, the parents do not want to warp the  child's psyche, so they allow her to run amok, claiming Audrey should  &quot;woo&quot; her. Later, when the child throws the car keys away, won't  divulge their location, and hours are spent searching a field for them,  Audrey's character, Joanna, loses her patience and gets in the girl's face,  privately screaming, &quot;tell your mother where the keys are, RIGHT  NOW! &quot; Immediately, the child gives them back. When the mother asks  Joanna how she got the results, Audrey replies, &quot;I wooed her!&quot;  and walks away. Thank goodness the UNICEF people never got a look at that  scene (smile). The best part of this movie is its' honest and objective  look at love and life. It's not the glossed-over fantasy in which we prefer  to see our screen idols, but, that's what makes the few cleverly objective,  yet fun, movies, like this one, shine through.",5,&quot;DOESN'T THIS CAR HAVE ANY OTHER SPEED THAT 110 AND STOP?&quot;,962496000,"07 2, 2000",2000,2703,"['quot', 'TWO', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'quot', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'what', 'when', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ends', 'couple', 'quot', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.', 'quot', 'film', 'four', 'vignettes', 'in-', 'out-of-', 'sequence', 'stylish', 'economically-upwardly-mobile', 'British', 'couple', 'four', 'different', 'road', 'trips', 'same', 'road', 'France', 'different', 'stages', 'relationship', 'first', 'real', 'time', 'trip', 'youths', 'when', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'second', 'struggling', 'newlyweds', 'third', 'have', 'had', 'affairs', 'fourth', 'have', 'achieved', 'financial', 'success', 'decay', 'marriage', 'led', 'downward', 'spiral', 'emotions', 'Instead', 'appearing', 'chronological', 'sequence', 'four', 'vignettes', 'are', 'edited/spliced', 'together', 'jumping', 'trip', 'trip', 'contrast', 'show', 'coordinated', 'alignment', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'revelations', 'beautiful', 'rural', 'French', 'scenery', 'lovely', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'score', 'brilliant', 'dialogue', 'greatest', '60', 'mod', 'fashions', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'one', 'particularly', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'car', 'wearing', 'black', 'shiny-vinyl', 'mod', 'pantsuit', 'Walking', 'lake', 'most', 'clarifying', 'line', 'film', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', ""'everything"", 'want', 'give', 'everything', 'YOU', 'WANT', 'TO', 'GIVE', 'ME', 'quot', 'line', 'volumes', 'couples', 'everywhere', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'tortured', 'miscommunications', 'mistreatments', 'misperceptions', 'involved', 'trying', 'love', 'Odd', 'line', 'nail', 'head', 'so', 'poignantly', 'seriously', 'Audrey', 'character', 'when', 'looking', 'Joanne', 'Worley', 'episode', 'quot', 'Laugh-In', 'quot', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'laughable', 'sequence', 'one', 'couple', 'friends', 'spoiled', 'daughter', 'Apparently', 'parents', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'warp', 'child', 'psyche', 'allow', 'run', 'amok', 'claiming', 'Audrey', 'should', 'quot', 'woo', 'quot', 'Later', 'when', 'child', 'car', 'keys', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'location', 'hours', 'are', 'spent', 'searching', 'field', 'Audrey', 'character', 'Joanna', 'patience', 'girl', 'face', 'privately', 'screaming', 'quot', 'tell', 'mother', 'where', 'keys', 'are', 'RIGHT', 'NOW', 'quot', 'Immediately', 'child', 'back', 'When', 'mother', 'Joanna', 'how', 'got', 'results', 'Audrey', 'replies', 'quot', 'wooed', 'quot', 'walks', 'away', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'UNICEF', 'people', 'never', 'got', 'look', 'scene', 'smile', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'honest', 'objective', 'look', 'love', 'life', 'not', 'glossed-over', 'fantasy', 'prefer', 'see', 'screen', 'idols', 'what', 'few', 'cleverly', 'objective', 'yet', 'fun', 'movies', 'one', 'shine']",N/A

343063,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6302878527,Classic film buff,"[3, 3]","Ever wonder what became of Audrey Hepburn's romantic heroines, in for example ""Sabrina"", ""Funny Face"" or ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", once the movie ended and they were on their way to ""happily ever after""?  If so, then you definitely want to view ""Two for the Road"", which takes her character Joanna Wallace past the charming courtship, the blissful falling in love, and into the marriage itself over approximately a 12 year span.  The marital journey taken by her husband Mark Wallace played by Albert Finney and she is not always on a smooth, broad ribbon of road, but one sometimes dotted with potholes, bumps and detours.  In other words it's a real marriage, not a fairy tale.Joanna and Mark, both young English tourists travelling in France meet by accident, literally.  Thrown together by circumstance, the two hitchhike across the verdant French countryside and in the process fall in love and begin an idyllic affair, which leads to marriage.  However the novelty of the film is that we never see the Wallaces back in their native England in their everyday milieu; rather we experience their marriage through four separate vacations in France where they drive through and revisit some of the haunts from their initial trip.  A greater innovation is that these trips are not shown chronologically or consecutively.  Rather they criss-cross back and forth, interrupt one another, and follow their own path, a particular memory may have an association with another from a different time.  This is very real and quite natural, and not at all confusing.  The astute viewer will be able to follow the time sequences quite easily if need be by just noting the changes in Audrey Hepburn's hairstyles and the different cars used.This is the most romantic film about a couple travelling together since Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert took to the road in ""It Happened One Night"".  The French scenery is lush, sunlit (most of the time) and gorgeous, nature all in bloom; the filming must have taken place from May thru July.  There is an unspoiled, secluded beach cove for the lovers to cavort and cuddle, which unfortunately will be developed by Mark into a chic private playground for the idle rich.  The French Tourist Board should have paid a fee to the filmmakers since I'm sure this movie boosted tourism in a big way.  I know when I first saw this film on television back when I was seventeen, I wanted to travel the French highways and byways, and find my own Audrey Hepburn or Jacqueline Bisset (there in a brief early cameo)!  The screenplay by Frederic Raphael is witty and artful, comic yet tender, yes you will laugh, but you also will have a tug or two on your heartstrings, as Joanna and Mark weather the vicissitudes of married life.  Above all, it rings true in an honest portrayal of marriage being something a couple must both work at for success, but if you both can share a private smile and a laugh through it all you're halfway there!If ""Singin' in the Rain"" is director Stanley Donen's musical masterpiece, then ""Two for the Road"" is certainly his dramatic one; he has done none better before or since.  Ditto for the musical score by Henry Mancini, it is just glorious, almost like a third character with the couple highlighting and underscoring the action with euphoric strings for the joyous moments and muted horns for the shadowed ones.  My favorite moment is where the music peaks rapturously as Joanna and Mark arrive on the beach breathless, and cling to each other in an ardent kiss their bodies as one silhouetted against a brilliant fireball of a sunset, and Joanna utters the title line of this review.  The title theme immediately sets the mood, it is everything it should be lyrical, poignant, bittersweet and unashamedly romantic, and it is repeated most skillfully in key moments.Before moving on to the performances of the principal players, some brief words about the supporting cast.  Eleanor Bron and William Daniels as a pretentious, self absorbed American couple; Cathy and Howard Maxwell-Manchester,""friends"" of Mark's, nail  their parts down, particularly the British Ms. Bron who does a truly flawless American princess accent.  The newlywed Wallaces have the trip from hell as they travel together with them and their appalling moppet of a daughter Ruthie, who is in the top five most horrible movie kids of all time.  As mentioned earlier this is one of Jacqueline Bisset's first movie roles, in a tiny part as Jackie one of Joanna's choirgirl friends, and she is as luscious as a ripe peach, definitely jump starting my teenage libido the first time I saw her way back when!At times Albert Finney's Mark is difficult to like since he doesn't always appreciate what a marvelous woman he has in Joanna, and doesn't treat her as well as he should.  But Mr. Finney paints with sure strokes a strong portrait going from callow youth to the older disillusioned husband, and you always feel he loves Joanna in his own fashion even if he doesn't always appreciate her.  He has a potent electricity with Ms. Hepburn; you truly believe them as a couple besotted with one another.Best for last; this is after ""The Nun's Story"", Audrey's Hepburn's most extraordinary performance, she creates cinema magic in her role as Joanna Wallace.  The timeless, enchanting charm is there as always as the young virginal Joanna.  However, she brings an added dimension as Joanna enters clear-eyed into her love affair with Mark, showing Joanna's own passion and desire.  In one scene Mark and she are playfully tussling, which changes into something stronger, as they gaze hungrily at each other  a soft sound, kind of a sigh mixed with a purr escapes her.  This is one sexy woman, as she is throughout the film.  She transitions effortlessly into the young wife, loving mother, and rueful woman who is trying to make sense of her life.  At the time of filming, Ms. Hepburn's own marriage to Mel Ferrer was on the rocks, and she brings a personal sense of heartache and depth of feeling into the older Joanna who is trying to salvage her own marriage.  Joanna is the stronger, more interesting character of the two, although Mark is the architect, she builds the relationship and is continually the ""fixer"" of their lives.  As always she looks exquisite, but no Givenchy this time, Stanley Donen wanted a simpler wardrobe for her character, although as the older more affluent woman, her clothes and hairstyle become more chic and expensive, very ""mod"" in the mid 1960's styles, particularly one mini-dress covered in shiny, metallic discs.  This performance is so Oscar worthy, she was nominated that year but for her taut, besieged blind woman in ""Wait Until Dark"", which was well deserved, too bad the latter didn't open the next year, so she could have been nominated for this one as well.  Still, it was the other Hepburn, Katharine, won a sympathy Oscar that year for ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", a damned injustice.The only extras are Stanley Donen's commentary, which is well worth a listen, the original trailer, and a still gallery.  Regardless, try this film, like the Wallaces, this is one trip you'll want to revisit over and over again.",5,"""I'm so happy, I'm so happy, I love you...Find us a big bed!""",1273795200,"05 14,

343065,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6302878527,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[10, 11]","When Mark and Joanna Wallace see a pair of newlyweds in a car, amid a throng of rice-flinging well-wishers, the following exchange is heard.Joanna:  They don't look very happy.Mark:  Why should they?  They just got married.It's clear that the Wallaces' marriage has seen better days from that cynical observation.  Joanna is sick of seeing her successful architect husband at the beck and call of a certain Maurice, her husband's jaded indifference and extramarital affairs.  That leads to an introspective look at their past, given by a series of questions is posed.  Where did it all go wrong?  You haven't been happy since the day we met, have you?  Why do we keep on with this farce?  Is it worth it?  And of course, how long is this going to go on?  These also seem to reflect Hepburn's own marriage to Mel Ferrer, which would last for one more year.The series of flashbacks, told non-linearly, takes the viewer seeing how Mark and Joanna first met, their travels with another married couple, and the time when they had their first child, when Mark's preoccupation in his career rather than his family reveals the first cracks appearing in their marriage.  And the film's running gag involves Mark unable to find his passport, because Joanna has taken it from him.  This comes into play as the one consistent thing in their relationship, and a reminder of the past.By far, the days when Max and Joanna hitchhike across France are the happiest.  Sure, they are on a strict budget, being rained on, and a temperamental MG auto, which has a destructive sendoff when it finally poops out.  But they were like a couple of kids without a care in the world, having fun.  &quot;What kind of people eat without saying a word to each other?&quot;  The answer is married people, they say during their romantic period.  Years later, when their marriage is on the rocks, they make the same observation, only this time it's about themselves.David, Joanna's extramarital lover, puts perspective on things when he tells her &quot;there comes a time when one must grow, when the old things aren't amusing anymore.&quot;  So what does one do when the old things include marriage or being together?  Does one stick it out and become more miserable and self-denying, or does one call it a day?  What's clear is that promises of never disappointing one another, that the marriage will be one of heaven, and the magic disappears once things don't become personal anymore, but driven by something else.The transitions between the different times can be differentiated in the car driven, Joanna's hairstyle, dress, and how happy Mark and Joanna are.  Donen's sudden jump cuts from present to the various pasts are effective and creative.Audrey Hepburn is wonderful as usual, and there's growth in the kind of character she plays.  Joanna is a variation of Anna (Roman Holiday) or Sabrina, full of fun and laughter, but she also represents a departure from those genteel characters.  Scenes where it's apparent she's nude under the covers--unheard of for Audrey Hepburn, right?  And her playing an adulterous woman who humiliates her husband?  Albert Finney does well as Mark, and his manners of speech range from the comical Bogart-like voice during their premarital trek to a tired weariness.Two For The Road is also the last movie Hepburn did with director Stanley Donen (Funny Face, Charade).  And upon a personal request from Hepburn, Henry Mancini does another winning theme song, fittingly sweet yet nostalgic.  It sets a precedent for Audrey Hepburn, away from the innocent virgin roles of before.

The surreal opening sequence, featuring animated traffic signs floating past the screen whilst credits fade in and out, sets the mood perfectly -  complete with a beautiful Mancini theme - for a film that is somewhere  North of Comedy, but just a bit South from Drama. It's correct to assume  that very little has ever depicted a relationship so true to life.The  bitter beginning shows the distance between the seemingly unhappily married  couple of Joanna (Audrey Hepburn) and Mark (Albert Finney) Wallace. It is  nothing short of fitting.From that point on the movie jumps from  point-to-point on the time line of their relationship. The fun and  fancy-free aura of their early years to the bitter and cold homestretch, ... .""Two For The Road"" is certainly a far cry from anything  audiences had seen prior to that and is certainly something film makers try  to reproduce frequently - with far less success. The film is a classic in  its own right and something all movie lovers should witness. The  pain-stakingly real performance of Audrey Hepburn was no surprise and it's  also no wonder why she remains one of Hollywood's favorite leading ladies.  Albert Finney's portrayal of a loving man with a cold faade only  compliments his opposite's performance (ironically enough, it is most  evident when they clash). It's clear that this movie makes you fall in love  it it just as many times as the characters do, but you can only walk away  from it with a smile on your face for the seconds, with the couple uttering  their pet names for each other that are just as obscene as they are  romantic and driving off into the horizon, you see that even in it's  darkest hours, life is beautiful.

343069,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,6302878527,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[6, 7]","Many movies are about falling in love, the euphoria of being in love, getting married and living happily ever after. ""Two For The Road"" is director Stanley Donen's extremely bittersweet look at what happens after the euphoria of love has died long ago, and the married couple is living (not very happily) together ever after.Embarking on yet another ""working"" vacation through Europe, Mark and Joanna Wallace (Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn) recall their twelve year marriage, from 1954-1966. The marriage is not shown in chronilogical order. Instead, events are revealed as the characters remember them; in scattered, often overlapping, bits and pieces. The movie proceeds the way a person's memory of their life actually works, jumping back and forth in time. The non-chronilogical order does put some viewers off. Some people have told me they couldn't follow or get into this movie at all. That is their loss. The movie is easy to follow because Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn, whether experiencing domestic bliss or discord, make an extremely compelling couple..  There is romance in the story but, for the most part, ""Two For The Road"" favors bitter reality over romance.  The non-chronilogical sequencing of events works to the film's emotional advantage.  We see how Mark and Joanna's marriage soured BEFORE we see how they initially fell in love. Our knowledge of what went wrong and how gives the scenes of their happy times added poignancy.Mark and Joanna suffer through a humorously disasterous 1956 vacation with Mark's former girlfriend, the snobby Cathy Maxwell-Manchester (Eleanor Bron), her neurotic, control-freak husband Howard (William Daniels) and their bratty daughter Ruthie-Bell.But the movie is centered around Mark and Joanna as they negotiate the bumpy road of marriage; loving, bantering, bickering, injuring, reconcilling-- all the while breaking their own hearts and ours. Frederic Raphel's script is extremely astringent and often brutally honest in its depiction of marriage. The film takes a decidedly adult and frank look at adultry.Both Mark and Joanna engage in extramarital affairs, but the film looks at each one differently. The rather selfish and chronically insecure Mark has an afternoon fling that is treated as a lark. Joanna doesn't even know about it. Later, when Joanna has a more serious affair with one of Mark's business clients (Georges Descrieres), the wound hits much more deeply. Realizing that lover David is deadly dull and serious;  and Mark, for all his character flaws, is much more fun, Joanna, full of love and regret, returns to Mark. A relieved Mark nevertheless, wounds Joanna in retaliation in a way that is impossible to forgive or forget. In order to remain together as a couple, Mark and Joanna must accept how they have changed as individuals.""Two For The Road"" is unquestionably (in my opinion) the best performance of Audrey Hepburn's career. As Joanna, Audrey  displays a full range of emotions; especially love, devotion, humor, pain, and heartbreak. There is a lot of depth and pain in Audrey Hepburn's performance, and she definitely deserved an Academy Award for it. If Audrey's on-screen relationship with Albert Finney rings too painfully true, that is because ""Two For The Road"" plays like real life instead of a romantic Hollywood movie.",5,"""AUDREY HEPBURN GIVES HER BEST PERFORMANCE IN THIS BITTERSWEET ROAD TRIP""",1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,3321,"['Many', 'movies', 'are', 'falling', 'love', 'euphoria', 'being', 'love', 'getting', 'married', 'living', 'happily', 'ever', 'Two', 'Road', 'director', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'extremely', 'bittersweet', 'look', 'what', 'euphoria', 'love', 'died', 'long', 'ago', 'married', 'couple', 'living', 'not', 'very', 'happily', 'together', 'ever', 'after.Embarking', 'yet', 'working', 'vacation', 'Europe', 'Mark', 'Joanna', 'Wallace', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'recall', 'twelve', 'year', 'marriage', '1954-1966', 'marriage', 'not', 'shown', 'chronilogical', 'order', 'Instead', 'events', 'are', 'revealed', 'characters', 'remember', 'scattered', 'often', 'overlapping', 'bits', 'pieces', 'movie', 'way', 'person', 'memory', 'life', 'actually', 'jumping', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'non-chronilogical', 'order', 'put', 'viewers', 'off', 'people', 'have', 'told', 'could', ""n't"", 'follow', 'get', 'movie', 'loss', 'movie', 'easy', 'follow', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'experiencing', 'domestic', 'bliss', 'discord', 'make', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'couple..', 'romance', 'story', 'most', 'part', 'Two', 'Road', 'favors', 'bitter', 'reality', 'romance', 'non-chronilogical', 'sequencing', 'events', 'works', 'film', 'emotional', 'advantage', 'see', 'how', 'Mark', 'Joanna', 'marriage', 'soured', 'see', 'how', 'initially', 'fell', 'love', 'knowledge', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'how', 'scenes', 'happy', 'times', 'added', 'poignancy.Mark', 'Joanna', 'suffer', 'humorously', 'disasterous', '1956', 'vacation', 'Mark', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'snobby', 'Cathy', 'Maxwell-Manchester', 'Eleanor', 'Bron', 'neurotic', 'control-freak', 'husband', 'Howard', 'William', 'Daniels', 'bratty', 'daughter', 'Ruthie-Bell.But', 'movie', 'centered', 'Mark', 'Joanna', 'negotiate', 'bumpy', 'road', 'marriage', 'loving', 'bantering', 'bickering', 'injuring', 'reconcilling', 'while', 'breaking', 'own', 'hearts', 'ours', 'Frederic', 'Raphel', 'script', 'extremely', 'astringent', 'often', 'brutally', 'honest', 'depiction', 'marriage', 'film', 'decidedly', 'adult', 'frank', 'look', 'Mark', 'Joanna', 'engage', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'film', 'one', 'differently', 'rather', 'selfish', 'chronically', 'insecure', 'Mark', 'afternoon', 'fling', 'treated', 'lark', 'Joanna', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Later', 'when', 'Joanna', 'more', 'serious', 'affair', 'one', 'Mark', 'business', 'clients', 'Georges', 'Descrieres', 'wound', 'much', 'more', 'deeply', 'Realizing', 'lover', 'David', 'deadly', 'dull', 'serious', 'Mark', 'character', 'flaws', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'Joanna', 'full', 'love', 'regret', 'returns', 'Mark', 'relieved', 'Mark', 'nevertheless', 'Joanna', 'retaliation', 'way', 'impossible', 'forgive', 'forget', 'order', 'remain', 'together', 'couple', 'Mark', 'Joanna', 'must', 'accept', 'how', 'have', 'changed', 'individuals', 'Two', 'Road', 'unquestionably', 'opinion', 'best', 'performance', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'career', 'Joanna', 'Audrey', 'full', 'range', 'emotions', 'especially', 'love', 'devotion', 'humor', 'pain', 'heartbreak', 'lot', 'depth', 'pain', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'performance', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Audrey', 'on-screen', 'relationship', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'rings', 'too', 'painfully', 'true', 'Two', 'Road', 'real', 'life', 'instead', 'romantic', 'Hollywood', 'movie']",N/A

343074,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302878527,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 8]","I read in Danny Peary's ""A Guide for the Film Fanatic"" that some people have formed a strong emotional attachment to this 1967 film. I am one of them.  From the opening notes of Henry Mancini's evocative score (personally I think it's his best work) to the end where the main characters drive off into Italy after some verbal sparring, this movie still provides the same pleasure it did when I first saw it on TV in the early seventies. ""Two for the Road"" is a time capsule of Carnaby Street fashion and French new wave scene juxtaposition, but it remains timeless in its emotionally piercing view of marriage and in the beguiling presence of Audrey Hepburn.  There will unlikely be an actress with more style or grace on screen, and never has she seemed more sexy, playful or innately human. It's a shame she never played a role as rich in texture as Frederic Raphael's script provides here. His dialogue is sharp and insightful, as he has the main characters often repeat one another for the sake of getting a different meaning from the same line of dialogue.As Joanna and Mark Wallace, Hepburn and Albert Finney get to live out more than a decade in their characters' lives from initial meeting to near-divorce. What makes the evolution more impressive is that the story is not a linear narrative but rather a series of five road trips that volley the viewer back and forth in the relationship. Finney provides a formidable match for Hepburn, and he plays with the right mix of roguish insouciance and insecure ambition that doesn't make his character always likeable but certainly believable.  Their chemistry is palpable, especially in the early days of their courtship as the movie makes hitchhiking the most romantic of adventures with the couple cutting through the entirety of France in various vehicles in record time. Only in the movies. The episode with the pretentious American tourist couple and their bratty daughter provides some biting and funny moments...ironically, the actress portraying the wife, Eleanor Bron, is British. Not surprising that this movie was not such a huge hit stateside since the four Americans in the movie are portrayed in such an unflattering light.Regardless, credit needs to go to director Stanley Donen (himself an American), who somehow pulls all these disparate elements together and uses his extensive Hollywood experience to bring a nice glossy sheen to the whole film. His third collaboration with Hepburn (after ""Funny Face"" and ""Charade"") really turns into a tribute to her as she makes a remarkable transformation from nave choirgirl to jaded jet-set housewife that goes well beyond the changing hairstyles and clothing. This is one to treasure.**ADDENDUM ABOUT THE DVD RELEASE POSTED ON NOVEMBER 17, 2005**At last!...This wondrous film has been lovingly restored for its much-delayed DVD release. The print quality has been significantly improved over the VHS tape I've had for over a decade. A nice bonus feature is a split-screen before-and-after short that shows the visual improvement. Best of all, there is finally an audio commentary track to accompany the film, and Donen provides illuminating insight on the elliptical narrative structure and the non-chronological juxtaposition of the scenes. He explains that the characters are reliving their memories by association with the feelings they are having in the present. His adoration of Hepburn is pervasive and understandable, as he claims rightfully that this was her best performance (they worked together three times). I just wish Finney was available to add his perspective. Moreover, if you ever wondered why the young Jacqueline Bisset's voice doesn't sound like her at all, he admits she was re-dubbed by another actress due to the blaring noise of generators during the location shooting. She apparently had already moved on to shoot her first Hollywood film.

343079,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6302878527,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[4, 5]","Increasingly influenced by Italian neo-realism and French new wave, English and American motion picture styles changed a great deal during the 1960s--but for the most part the greater change was confined to small art films or movies aimed at the youth market.  But in 1967 three motion picture heavy weights took on the challenge: Stanley Donen, Albert Finney, Audrey Hepburn.  The film was named TWO FOR THE ROAD, and it followed the rise and fall of a marriage as the couple take repeated car trips across France--first as happy young lovers, ultimately as disillusioned and faithless husband and wife.  What made the film unexpected was that it jumbled the various trips, showing first a scene from one and then a scene from another, jumping and cross cutting across time and space in a way that makes D.W. Griffith's INTOLERANCE seem positively unsophistocated.Audrey Hepburn had previously appeared in the 1964 PARIS WHEN IT SIZZLES, a flyweight comedy that juxtaposes fantasy and reality; it had been one of her few major failures, a box office bomb and a critical debacle, and from her point of view TWO FOR THE ROAD was too similar.  She repeatedly declined the project until writer-director Stanley Donen revised the script to her satisfaction, but even so she remained anxious about the project.  Even with Hepburn signed, Donen had tremendous difficulty finding a leading man.  Everyone wanted to work with Hepburn but no one, including Michael Cain and Paul Newman, wanted to do it on this particular film.  Ultimately, Albert Finney--a noted stage actor who was best known in film as the leading man in TOM JONES--took it on.Casting was not the only difficulty.  Excepting a few restaurant and hotel scenes, TWO FOR THE ROAD is a film shot outside and in one car after another.  At the time, car scenes were usually done by having the car towed or by putting the car in front of a rear projection screen.  In this film, however, the actors had to play the scenes while driving the car, and new techniques had to created.  In several scenes the actors themselves were required to call the takes and press various buttons that operated the cameras mounted to the car.  Since there was a tremendous amount of background noise involved in the shoot, a large percentage of the film had to be looped, a process in which the various actors re-record their dialogue.  And although most films are shot out of sequence, TWO FOR THE ROAD was already written out of sequence, a fact that made continunity an extreme challenge.  When all was said and done, no one expected much of such a hard-to-make film, so it was probably a shock to all concerned when it became the critical darling of its year.As previously noted, the film is a portrait of a marriage as it evolves over the course of a decade or so.  Mark (Finney) is an archetech; Joanna (Hepburn) is a member of a girl's choir.  Both are traveling through France, and when everyone in the choir except Joanna is struck down by chicken pox the two find themselves unwilling companions.  A decade or more later Mark is a success with little time or interest for his wife and daughter, Joanna despises the demands his success has made on both of them, and they drive through France wondering if divorce is the answer.  Between these two points there are other trips, most notably one with the obnoxiously American Manchester family, a one night stand for Mark, a more serious affair for Joanna, and a series of romantic interludes, violent arguments, and comic disasters.Although the critics adored it, some viewers simply found it confusing, and even today many find it difficult to follow--or to know how to react to the film.  Is it a comedy?  Certainly there is plenty to laugh about, particularly where the M.G. or the Manchester family is involved.  Is it a drama?  You don't get a lot more serious than the moment in which Joanna admits her affair to Mark.  But the real flaw in the film is that what seemed fresh and new in 1967 has been done quite a few times since.  These days we're used to actors driving cars: at the time the innovation was exciting, but today we scarcely notice it.  The notion of cross cutting between time and various time loops was not exactly new in 1967, but it was still unexpected; today, of course, it is a commonplace.  And so TWO FOR THE ROAD has in many ways fallen victim to its own innovations: later films took the ideas, improved upon them, and now we've seen it all before.Even so, the expert performances of Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn make the film worth watching.  They have tremendous chemistry together; it is a pity they did not repeat the pairing.  The period costuming is fascinating--Hepburn becomes something of an evolving fashion plate as the film progresses, going from jeans to a silver-disk evening gown--and the overall production quality is outstanding.  The script is also remarkably witty and insightful.  What more could you possibly want?  As for bonus material, there is a commentary by director-writer Donnen, but it is rather disappointing and best left to hardcore fans of the film.

343080,A1IT9VY8Z9RG92,6302878527,"G. D. Williams ""gareth37""","[2, 2]","This Audrey Hepburn's vehicle from 1967 is not your typical romantic comedy.  It has a lot of dark elements as it explores the relationship of Mark and Joanna Wallace (Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn who was 38 at the time, even though at 38 her eternal youthfulness and beauty were still pristine).The beauty of France in the late 60s is exquisitely interwoven into this film about first love, courtship, marriage, parenthood and the growing indifferences a couple allow to creep into their relationship. It covers the whole gamut of emotions between Mark and Joanna.A young couple meets by happenstance and love develops like a 1945 Chteau Mouton Rothschild wine. When you toss in the beautiful music of Henry Mancini, you have a well-crafted story which at times is very complex as the history of this couple is shown in flashbacks.This is not a film which you can excuse yourself for several moments and come back to since the past or present may be showing leaving the viewer somewhat bewildered.  Put it on pause.  To miss just one scene is to miss an integral part of this film.There are many great scenes, especially the road trip with the Manchester Family (William Daniels, Eleanor Bron and Gabrielle Middleton) in their Ford Country Squire.

Decades ahead of its time, ""Two For The Road"" really anticipates the crazy narrative contortions of Charlie Kaufman and other modern screenwriters and still feels daring today. However, the relationship between Hepburn and Finney is so genuine and the dialogue so wittily precise that you'll never care about the exact chronology, which is almost impossible to figure out anyway. You'll just revel in one of the most hilarious and charming yet bitingly honest films about romance ever made. I have to imagine ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" owes something to this masterpiece.The seemingly simple narrative hook is this; Mark and Joanna meet while travelling across France. They then make the same journey at numerous points in their married lives, sometimes together, a few times alone. The genius of Raphael's screenplay is to intercut all of these trips, without any attempt to explain which trip we are seeing each time - there are no titles saying ""1956"" or ""1964"" at each change. Instead, we are able to follow the timeline by the way in which their relationship changes from lovers to newlyweds to bored spouses.The specifics of time, like fashion, and other little clues, do make it fairly easy to follow the chronology if you absolutely must, but it's not at all vital.

343096,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6302878527,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[8, 9]","In Stanley Donen's 1967 film Two for the Road, the audience will learn about the difficult journey of a marriage.  To capture a decade, or more, of a legally tied relationship in two hours might be exceptionally difficult, as there might be several different moments that deserve the attention.  However, Donen cleverly approaches the conceptual idea of marriage problems through the Oscar nominated script by Frederic Raphael, as the married couple portrayed by Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney sets off on vacation to the French Riviera.The film opens with Joanna (Audrey Hepburn) and Marc (Albert Finney) getting stuck in a wedding ceremony, as a couple of newlyweds enter a car.  In this scene, Joanna points out the negative aspect of the newlyweds by stating, ""They don't look very happy."" To which Marc dryly responds, ""Why should they? They just got married."", as he suggestively points out the problems of his own marriage with Joanna.  Yet, they seem to have it all; an expensive Mercedes that they can afford to bring on their flights while enjoying all the luxuries of life.  Nonetheless, these two cannot seem to find a way to concoct happiness within their marriage, as they continue their preoccupation with their unhappiness.Spiteful words and comments lash out from both Joanna and Marc, as the acts and expressions of love are far and distant apart.  They are flying to southern France where they have gone on vacation numerous times before while they both know everything there is about one another. They have acquired knowledge about each other over time and during their many trips together.  This time they have a seat open in-between suggesting the significant rift between them.  However, it was not always so, they once were darlings that struggled keeping their hands of one another.Through the inspirational storytelling technique that Raphael illustrates in his script, he brings a juxtaposition of several vacations from stretching from their first encounter, their second camping road trip, and the third vacation with friends.  There is also a vacation where they bring their daughter and the current vacation where they are flying and driving with their white Mercedes.  Each trip to the south brings a different vehicle, maybe representing some symbolical notion, but further discussion of the matter will not take place here.  However, the many vacations bring the audience on an affectionate journey to what created the icy and aloof atmosphere that lingers around Joanna and Marc.Two for the Road is presents an emotional drama with moments of terrific humor that fits the character of the film.  Occasionally the humor seems a little repetitive, but it is also quick and witty with much sarcasm.  Some of the recurring jokes might suggest a little why they are unhappy, as they both seem bored with each other.  Nonetheless, the film displays touching affection and sharp bitterness through the main characters' relationship.  Compatibility issues surface, as Joanna and Marc constantly seems to be at each other's throats.  Then there are the endearing moments that unite them, which brings out the human ambiguity in the story through the emotional rollercoaster of insecurities, trust issues, and passionate love.  It is an ingenious bobbing and weaving of emotions, as they ferociously throw vicious words at one another that ends up in passionate make up sessions where they tenderly express their zealousness.  Yet, it also offers the audience an opportunity to ponder the reasons why married people stay married, and why they can sit in each other's company without uttering a word.Two for the Road is an interesting film, as it provides dual feelings.  Occasionally, it brings the strong motions of tender feelings, yet then there are the moments when the film feels emotionally painful, as it might be close to heart for many married couples; including me.

After this her cinema appearances would be sporadic and in vehicles of uneven quality. She certainly went out with a bang, giving two topnotch performances in films that year, of which ""Two for the Road"" is one (""Wait Until Dark"" is the other).The lush photography of the French countryside and equally lush score by Henry Mancini link this film with other glossy Hepburn vehicles such as ""Charade,"" but Stanley Donen's film of a Frederic Raphael screenplay is a surprisingly acerbic and unsparing take on marriage. Mark Wallace (Albert Finney), an architect, and his wife Joanna (Hepburn) arrive in France, called to a project by his demanding boss. Their twelve-year union is obviously not in the best of shape, and as they travel toward their destination scenes from previous journeys they have taken together as a couple are intercut in alternately amusing, ironic and poignant flashbacks. The fluid time structure of the film remains remarkably fresh, and Hepburn rises to the demands of playing a woman at multiple ages and stages of life with ease, giving one of her finest and subtly shaded film performances, though a viewer with a heart of stone would have to admit she looks too mature for the earliest scenes in which she is supposed to be a college co-ed. Finney by comparison is one-note and overbearing early on, though he settles down as the film progresses, or perhaps the grating persona is deliberately imposed by the actor. At any rate the chemistry between him and Hepburn is obvious and adds to the credibility of the story; reports of an on-set romance seem entirely plausible.Not all of ""Two for the Road"" has aged equally well--the attempts at outright comedy, such as a running gag involving a lost passport, are now strained and a sequence with a smug American couple and their monster of a daughter descends into caricature. But as a gritty portrait of a long-term relationship and the compromises one must make, it holds up well against many successors. It must be said in closing, too, that Hepburn wears her frequently outlandish fashions with enviable ease.

She and Albert Finney play Joanna and Mark, a chic British couple, who quarrel their way across France in a variety of wonderful, compact European cars during their twelve year marriage. Since they both take turns driving during the course of the film, it's clear that this is a marriage where no one person is in the ""driver's seat""--this is a marriage that (despite Mark's boorish behavior) is based on equality. The fact that they're usually in tiny cars also signifies the sometimes claustrophobic intimacy they experience with each other.Joanna and Mark argue their way around a long-gone France, that has little traffic and a bucolically undisturbed countryside. But Mark's an architect with a wealthy French client, whose developments will destroy the pastoral rural areas that he and Joanna equate with the beginnings of their relationship. Both the countryside and their marriage have lost their original purity and innocence. Mark is a blowhard who is constantly making arrogant claims for himself, but he continuously looses his passport, which Joanna always manages to quietly retrieve. She is the one who really anchors his identity, and the fact that underneath his arrogant facade, he realizes it and loves her for it, gives the film its emotional depth.An added bonus is Hepburn's charming mid-sixties ""mod"" wardrobe. I particularly liked the  dress made out of what looked like little mirrors that she wears towards the end of the film (how'd she get that in her suitcase?) and the Courreges dress and bug-eyed sunglasses she wears in the final scene.

After having let it sit in my memory for several months, I feel like I can review it.I had never heard of it when I came across it at the video store. ""A young Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn? That's for me!"" I thought. Two of my favorite actors at any stage of their careers, and Albert Finney was irresistible as a young man in ""Tom Jones."" The box made ""Two for the Road"" sound like a screwball romantic comedy, so I was not at all prepared for what followed.First, if you expect Albert Finney's character to be endearing, modify your expectation. Sometimes he is, but often he's an arrogant jerk. Audrey Hepburn's got a bit of an edge to her character as well.Second, if you expect a conventional romantic comedy, set that expectation aside. While the movie has some very funny scenes, and you see lots of lovely French countryside (as well as a variety of cars for automotive buffs), ""Two for the Road"" makes little effort to be crowd-pleasing or predictable. Instead, we travel down the rocky road of marriage, in an experimental but not wholly successful series of flashbacks.We begin with an unhappy English couple, architect Mark Wallace and his wife Joanna (Finney and Hepburn), flying to the South of France to meet an important client of Mark's. The movie goes back and forth over a twelve-year period, following the couple on various road trips through France, to look at how they started, how they arrived where they are, and what the future might hold for them. Sometimes they are close, sometimes they are distant, sometimes they are happy, sometimes they are alienated. They don't always treat each other well.The acting is good and Hepburn and Finney have great chemistry. The tone bounces all over the place, by turns romantic, wistful, caustic, and trying too hard to be hilarious. The pacing is a bit herky-jerky as well, and some episodes go on too long. For instance, when an obnoxious American family first joins Mark and Joanna on their travels, it's funny, but we get tired of them before Mark and Joanna do.By the end I felt worn out and unsettled. But as time passed, I realized that was the point. Instead of an easy-to-digest fairy tale, the filmmakers present a version of truth about a long-term relationship in a turbulent world of confused values and ask the audience to think for ourselves along the way. As a result, ""Two for the Road"" stays with the viewer in a way a movie that spoon-feeds the audience can never do.The DVD we rented had only fair sound and picture quality.

343107,A3QFC8X23IR3QC,6302878527,"Michael C. Smith ""MGMboy@aol.com""","[16, 16]","A brilliant, funny, sad and true screenplay is the basis for this, one of the great films of the late 1960's. Director Stanley Donen who is blessed with wit and talent has headed such films as ""Singing In The Rain"", ""Funny Face"", and ""Charade"". Here he has assembled a marvelous cast in one of his finest efforts. It is one of his cleverest works that interlaces the past, present and future in one beautifully realized stream of consciousness in the now.One of the standout supporting performers is Eleanor Bron an accomplished British actress whom American audiences may remember as Patsy's mother from ""Absolutely Fabulous"". She is incredible with her very Bryn Mawr accent as one half of a parent team who is completely run by her bratty demanding child. She is just a joy to watch as the uncomfortable comedy unfolds.Albert Finney is fine in the demanding role of Mark Wallace, a young reluctant to marry fellow who at first prefers Jacqueline Bisset's more voluptuous charms to the more sophisticated allure of Audrey Hepburn. He hits all the right notes from early romance to bored married man.In this film we are given perhaps the finest of Audrey Hepburn's film performances. She is allowed to go to places in her character that few of her earlier films permitted. In the hands of a brilliant man like Donen she is an unfolding revelation of star power, talent and beauty. It is interesting to note that this is one of the few films in which Hubert De Givenchy did not dress her. Donen wanted a more realistic woman of her means and place. But even in off the rack clothes she looks incredible.Of course a great film always begins with a great screenplay and in ""Two For The Road"" we have a wonderful example of screenwriting by Fredric Raphael. I am especially fond of his sharp and still fresh use of time bending. Note how the Mark and Joanna of the late 60's pass the Mark and Joanna of the late 50's on the road. This writer takes us on a wonderful and insightful look into a marriage and what it takes to make it work.Cinematography by Christopher Challis is so crisp that it seems to have been shot only last week. Filled with the glorious panorama of France on the road, this is an utterly gorgeous film to watch.Also contributing to the film is composer Henry Mancini who with his haunting and evocative score brings so much to the feel and pace of the story. This is one of his best scores in a career filled with great music.Ultimately with all the wonderful contributions by all the artists and players one must tip one's hat to the genius behind it all, a great director and a fine artist in every sense, Stanley Donen. A real treat in this DVD of the Twentieth Century Fox Film Classics series is the addition of Mr. Donen's witty and delightful reminiscences of the making of the film on the director's commentary track. Like is commentary on the Criterion Collection of ""Charade"" Mr. Donen is just a joy to listen to. It is as if he has just dropped by to watch the film with you and in so doing he reveals himself to be nothing more than a charming man full of great stories to tell.",5,A Donen Masterpiece,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,3109,"['brilliant', 'funny', 'sad', 'true', 'screenplay', 'basis', 'one', 'great', 'films', 'late', '1960', 'Director', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'who', 'blessed', 'wit', 'talent', 'headed', 'such', 'films', 'Singing', 'Rain', 'Funny', 'Face', 'Charade', 'Here', 'assembled', 'marvelous', 'cast', 'one', 'finest', 'efforts', 'one', 'cleverest', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'one', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'now.One', 'standout', 'supporting', 'performers', 'Eleanor', 'Bron', 'accomplished', 'British', 'actress', 'whom', 'American', 'audiences', 'may', 'remember', 'Patsy', 'mother', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'incredible', 'very', 'Bryn', 'Mawr', 'accent', 'one', 'half', 'parent', 'team', 'who', 'completely', 'run', 'bratty', 'demanding', 'child', 'just', 'joy', 'watch', 'uncomfortable', 'comedy', 'unfolds.Albert', 'Finney', 'fine', 'demanding', 'role', 'Mark', 'Wallace', 'young', 'reluctant', 'marry', 'fellow', 'who', 'first', 'prefers', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'more', 'voluptuous', 'charms', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'allure', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'right', 'notes', 'early', 'romance', 'bored', 'married', 'man.In', 'film', 'are', 'given', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'film', 'performances', 'allowed', 'go', 'places', 'character', 'few', 'earlier', 'films', 'permitted', 'hands', 'brilliant', 'man', 'Donen', 'unfolding', 'revelation', 'star', 'power', 'talent', 'beauty', 'interesting', 'note', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'Hubert', 'De', 'Givenchy', 'did', 'not', 'dress', 'Donen', 'wanted', 'more', 'realistic', 'woman', 'means', 'place', 'even', 'off', 'rack', 'incredible.Of', 'course', 'great', 'film', 'always', 'great', 'screenplay', 'Two', 'Road', 'have', 'wonderful', 'example', 'screenwriting', 'Fredric', 'Raphael', 'am', 'especially', 'fond', 'sharp', 'still', 'fresh', 'use', 'time', 'bending', 'Note', 'how', 'Mark', 'Joanna', 'late', '60', 'pass', 'Mark', 'Joanna', 'late', '50', 'road', 'writer', 'wonderful', 'insightful', 'look', 'marriage', 'what', 'make', 'work.Cinematography', 'Christopher', 'Challis', 'so', 'crisp', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'only', 'last', 'week', 'Filled', 'glorious', 'panorama', 'France', 'road', 'utterly', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'watch.Also', 'contributing', 'film', 'composer', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'who', 'haunting', 'evocative', 'score', 'brings', 'so', 'much', 'feel', 'pace', 'story', 'one', 'best', 'scores', 'career', 'filled', 'great', 'music.Ultimately', 'wonderful', 'contributions', 'artists', 'players', 'one', 'must', 'tip', 'one', 'hat', 'genius', 'great', 'director', 'fine', 'artist', 'sense', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'real', 'treat', 'DVD', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Film', 'Classics', 'series', 'addition', 'Mr.', 'Donen', 'witty', 'delightful', 'reminiscences', 'making', 'film', 'director', 'commentary', 'track', 'commentary', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Charade', 'Mr.', 'Donen', 'just', 'joy', 'listen', 'just', 'dropped', 'watch', 'film', 'so', 'doing', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'charming', 'man', 'full', 'great', 'stories', 'tell']",N/A

Moore,"[6, 6]","Stanley Donen, after making some of the most delightful musicals of the 1950s (Singin' in the Rain, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers), followed up with some of the brightest, most sophisticated comedies of the 1960s (Charade, Indiscreet, Bedazzled). Two for the Road is one of his very best, a deft and occasionally acid comedy aided immeasurably by Frederic Raphael's witty, elegantly structured screenplay. The story follows a well-heeled English couple on the verge of divorce on a motoring trip through France; through flashbacks, it follows the same couple through several previous French excursions, including their impoverished but happy honeymoon and an ill-advised journey with the husband's brainless old girlfriend, her pompous husband and their toxic brat of a daughter. The screenplay is supremely astute in depicting how love can change--and sometimes die--through the vagaries of time and human nature; but it is also supremely romantic in allowing love to triumph in the end. The film's structure is graceful and fluid, if sometimes tricky. Audrey Hepburn, that most exquisite of actresses, was never more radiant than she was here, and Albert Finney displays his bull-in-a-china-shop charm at full force. Eleanor Bron and William Daniels are a scream as the loathsome, proto-yuppie traveling companions of Hepburn and Finney.

I remember loving it and was happy to find the DVD on the shelf of my local library this week.  It's interesting to me to see how I react to films that I loved long ago.  Some hold up in my mind, some surpass my memories and some disappoint.  I'm sorry that this film falls into the latter category.It's still wonderful in its way---one of the last of the genre of romance films starring big named actors, set in glamourous locals....often in the south of France.  I enjoyed them all.  This rather combines the best of those films with the realistic seriousness that became popular soon after.  This isn't just a ""boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, fall out of love and fall back in love"" story.  We see the details which are painfully familiar to almost anyone who has ever been in love.Still we get the lush scenery of bucolic France while it was still the perfect setting for any love affair.  The music by Henry Mancini brings back the whole feeling of the time.  So there is plenty of pleasure for eye and ear.  Hepburn is sensationally beautiful and wears all of the costumes of the 12 year period the film spans with great style.  It's fun just to see what she's going to wear next.  We see the variety of modes of transportation, starting with Hepburn and her choir in an old VW bus, and Finney on the back of a tractor, and progressing through a series of cars as their prosperity increases.  There are scenes on the Mediterranean and in sumptuous villas, charming little hotels and luxurious bigger hotels.  It's a terrific travelog cum story.The story has its ups and downs like any marriage and it's a good thing that it is played out against such a gorgeous background and stars such attractive people, because it is a little wearing, frankly.  He is selfish, she is selfish.  He pays more attention to his work than his family.  She nags him.  He has an affair.  She has an affair -- the common stuff you can read about in any Ann Landers column.  But these are movie stars and we are supposed to care about them.  I was impressed by all the surface beauty back in '67; today I forgot about these characters five minutes after the show was over.

Although, at that age, I was a little confused by the film's structure, in which scenes from four different stages of the marriage of Mark and Joanna, the main characters, are juxtaposed, I did understand and appreciate the film's basic theme, that passionate love is enduring and, seemingly irrationally, can survive even the boredom that is inevitable in a long relationship.  The energy and intelligence of Finney and Hepburn give this quirky little film an added vitality and render the relationship of Mark and Joanna believable and even endearing.  This may be a serio-comedic film, but like serio-comedic life, it is infused with joy.  I loved it in 1964,and I love it now.

343117,AMZYAGVDQWTS,6302878527,Reviews No More,"[4, 5]","It surprises a lot of people that I like this movie as much as I do, but not as much as me.  I have owned it for 11 years now, and still find it as intriguing and heartbreaking as I do funny and thought-provoking.  In this 1967 film, we see Audrey Hepburn forego the Givenchy route of glamour in favor of playing Joanna, the long-suffering mate of a selfish and conceited architect named Mark Wallace (Albert Finney).  This movie is not shot in chronological order, but it shows the couple through various stages of their relationship in ways that contrast to certain scenes at different times in their unity.  While this may confuse some people, all you need to know is that Audrey was young, single Joanna traveling with Mark when her hair is long.  When her hair is to her shoulders and she's wearing bangs, they are newlyweds traveling with an American couple all over Europe with their horrible brat Ruthie Bell (""I thought you didn't like Joanna, daddy."").  She has stylish short hair when she's expecting their daughter Caroline and they're out on their own in the MG, and she has the unflattering bob with the hairband when their marriage is at its worst and she has an affair with David in France.  You know you're up-to-date when she's wearing ""groovy"" mod 60's styles that don't really suit her.  If you look to Albert Finney's character Mark, he never really changes at all in either appearance or attitude.You really wonder throughout the course of this film what can make a woman like Joanna stay for 12 years with a man as selfish and egotistical as Mark, and then you realize that he was that way from the very beginning.  Joanna saw him in a way that he indulged for a while, regardless of the fact that she didn't like him very much at first.  Also, you watch him make funny faces and utilize his charm in a way that makes you understand why she forgave his philandering.  You also understand what made her decide to humiliate him with an affair of her own.Two For the Road is a wonderful portrayal of twelve years in a British couple's marriage, but it could be anybody on this planet.  There is all the humor, the romance, failure, betrayal, anger, and undying devotion so many couples encounter in even less time than that.  Underneath it all is Henry Mancini's beautiful musical score to create extra magic to the screenplay that Stanley Donen has brought to effective fruition.  This movie is obviously not for everyone, but I would like to point out its ostentatious merits:  Nobody is perfect, and this movie makes that quite clear in spades.  It all comes down to forgiving and forgetting, then onto renewal.  Will this couple make it as they move to America for a few years after all they've been through already?  I like to think so.

In the opening, Finney and Hepburn are driving in their Mercedes-Benz from England to the French Riviera.  He's an architect, and they're driving to the home of Maurice Dalbret, the Frenchman who gave successful Finney his start.  During the road trip, its obvious the marriage is headed for trouble.  Flash Back time.  Twelve years ago, Finney is a back-packing student looking at buildings and Audrey is among a bevy of female music students going to a festival.  The happy times, the trials and tribulations and the whole gist of the film will appeal to many but not to others. (oh, well).  I like it.  Some felt that Hepburn was too old (7 years, to be exact) for Finney, but this is hardly a problem (wasn't Lucy older than Desi?).  The usually fastidious Hepburn was dressed by Mary Quant, Paco Rabannne &amp; Ken Scott: she even wears blue jeans!

343122,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302878527,Simon Davis,"[9, 10]","Stanley Donen's classic ""Two for the Road"", which chronicles the painful but also surprisingly at times quite comic breakdown of a 12 year old marriage comes as bit of a surprise after his main fame was for lavish musicals such as ""Singin' in the Rain"". He however handles the territory like a seasoned veteran in this vivid and perceptive examination of a love that has grown stale between a couple who have perhaps grown a little too used to each other. Framed in the unique format of a number of cross country road trips set at different times in the couples courtship, poor early years together when they have to share a vacation, and in one where the couple have a young child and affluence, these side by side vignettes ilustrate beautifully the idea of a tender love gradually growing cold with the passing of time. The two main characters in question are brought to life by a luminous Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney as the warring couple in two of their very finest performances that in the case of Audrey Hepburn in particular definately added new dimensions to her already well established screen persona.The story opens with husband and wife Mark and Joanna Wallace (Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn), are undertaking the latest in their series of long distance car trips from London down to the French Riviera. However unlike the previous excursions which were done for enjoyment and sightseeing this trip is solely a business arrangment to meet up with some of Mark's business collegues. This in itself shows a clear picture of the direction the Wallace's mariage has taken over the years. All is certainly not well between the by now financially prosperous couple and during the course of the trip the pair via flashbacks reflect  on their twelve year old marriage focusing on the state of their marriage during the previous road trips they have taken. The earliest flashback is to when they were an in love young couple; she touring as part of a girl's choir and he a struggling architect. At this early time in their courtship with no money and having to weather extremely unsatisfactory forms of transport such as a car with a burning engine and sleeping in a drain tube the love for each other only increases between the pair who are carefree, without serious commitments and ready to take on the world. The later flashbacks of the story see Joanna and Mark as a young married couple sharing a ride down south with a boring couple Howard and Cathy Manchester (William Daniels and Eleanor Bron), and their obnoxious daughter Ruthie (Gabrielle Middleton), with all the pitfalls occuring when one has to share a vacation with others. It also gives a vivid illustration of the direction that their own marriage could gradually be taking. Over this time the initial great love between the pair begins to become jaded and even the birth of their daughter really doen't seem to bring back that old magic into the relationship. The flashbacks illustrate the growing discord growing between the pair which results in both parties indulging in infidelties in an attempt to put some spark back in their marriage. When Joanna eventually asks for a divorce Mark hesitates as this will really bring all of their problems that are best kept hidden in his belief due to his high profile business connections, out into the open. The story then ends with the couple resolving to stay together and try and make the marriage work because aside from the bitterness and infidelities hey have both experienced after 12 years together they do actually need each other and really can't imagine their lives without the other.""Two for the Road"", could never be called your typical Hollywood marital comedy and its rather adult and at times unorthodox way of telling its story without the usual Hollywood flourishes makes the story almost as timely today as it was back on it's release in 1967. The two very different screen personas of Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney combine very well here and the elements of comedy brought into the story along with the largely non sentimental ending gives the story a hefty injection of reality not often seen in these types of films. Audrey Hepburn concluded her highly successful collaboration with veteran director Stanley Donen here after teaming superbly in such efforts as ""Funny Face"", and especially the classic ""Charade"". ""Two for the Road"", was without a doubt their most adult piece together and it's a pity that their work  as director and lead actress didn't continue into the late 60's when often more serious themes were being explored on screen. Audrey Hepburn manages to be totally convincing over the 12 year time span covered by the movie and her changing hairstyles, clothes, (she is a very different kind of fashion plate in this film compared to earlier efforts), and general attitude to life in general is a joy to witness proving what a fine mature actress she had become by this stage in her career. Despite their obnoxious screen characters William Daniels and Eleanor Bron are wonderful as the horrid tourists with the hateful little daughter who Joanna and Mark become trapped with on their middle cross country tour. The comic visit to Chantilly Chateau done in fast motion and William Daniels character's minute by minute planning of travel plans and expenses, does much to relieve the often heavy emotional business going on between Joanna and Mark. The film also benefits greatly from the exquisite on location photography done throughout France and the Riviera on the numerous road trips and it's interesting to see the gradual change in motor vehicle transportation the couple have as their material prosperity increases in direct relation to their decreasing unhappiness with their marriage and their lives in general. The continued flashbacks and then return to the present is also capably done and is very well complimented in the wonderfully candid screenplay by Frederic Raphael and by Henry Mancini's most interesting musical score which is one of his best, it being very reflective of this very ""mod"", late 1960's period.Anyone expecting your typical Audrey Hepburn comedy are probably in for a bit of a surprise here with ""Two for the Road"", but although I do tend to prefer Audrey in her more ""typical"", earlier types of roles I find this timely late 1960's effort not only stimulating adult storytelling but also a real indication of the direction Audrey Hepburn's career possibly might have taken had she not left films in that year for a long break to raise her family. With no older and suitably suave leading man like Cary Grant or Gary Cooper in sight, and minus the glamourous Givency outfits that were her screen trademark, Audrey however still glows on screen and gives a well thought out performance that compliments the very different acting style of Albert Finney  very well. Sensitively written marital comedies laced with human drama and emotion are a rare commodity nowadays which is why a viewing of Stanley Donen's 1967 effort ""Two for the Road"", is such a treat. Try and have a viewing of it soon.

343123,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,6302878527,Simon,"[6, 6]","This is a romantic drama different from others you might find in the genre. Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney play a couple who take repeated trips through Europe at various points in their life. The viewer watches them through the decades in out-of-sequence snippets as they fall in love, develop as a couple, have arguments, cheat, grow apart, and fall in love again. There's nothing melodramatic or contrived here, just a very honest look at how relationships change and carry on as we progress through life. Hepburn and Finney present real chemistry that makes them completely believable as a couple who've stayed together for so long.

Watching the bony, skinny Audrey Hepburn in a swimsuit, and dressed with different outfits and many different colored overly large sunglasses for her small face looks awkwardly outdated. The movie was slow and boring and I wished that I had stopped it in about 1/2 hour but didn't and instead stopped watching it in about an hour and 20 minutes. Even the humor was stupid with a little wining girl getting away with being nasty since her snobbish father didn't reprimand her on a car trip that the family took with Audrey and Albert. There are a lot better movies of Audrey Hepburn with much more class out there like Charade, Breakfast at Tiffany's and My Fair Lady. Albert Finney portrayed as a playboy in this movie is out-of-place and has made many way better movies like Scrooge, The Dresser and Miller's Crossing.

We follow the couple from their early carefree infatuation through marriage, parenthood, boredom, infidelity, and finally renewal of their relationship.Along the way, there are some memorable vignettes involving Joanna and Mark vacationing with another couple Howard and Cathy Manchester (amusingly played by William Daniels and Eleanor Bron) and their daughter Ruthie Manchester.  Howard and Cathy must be the most wittily neurotic twosome in movies and their daughter Ruthie is probably the most obnoxious child in movie history.The performances are uniformly excellent.

This is one of my favorite films and along with Roman Holiday, my favorite Audrey Hepburn film. Released in 1967, decades ahead of its time, it was over the heads of most viewers and failed to find much of an audience. But over the years its attracted a fanatical cult who just love it. And I'm certainly among them. Road is what I'd call a realistically romantic love story. One that ends HOPEFULLY more so than happily ever after. Rather than tell the story in a conventional sense, writer Frederic Raphael (Darling; Eyes Wide Shut) tells it in a series of flashbacks. But even the flashbacks dont unfold in a conventional sense. Rather, like memories, they weave in and out of time: linked by locales, people, even conversations. The movie opens with Joanna and Mark wondering if its all been worth it after 12 yrs of marriage. Both are somewhat bitter and cynical and wondering what went wrong. Using their summer vacations to France as they travel through their marriage memories, the movie is a unique cinematic road trip. The movie isnt that difficult to follow. There are a half dozen different time periods and you can easily tell where you are in time by the cars, Hepburn's clothes and hair styles and the like. Hepburn and Finney have great chemistry (there were rumors of an affair and it was true her marriage broke up around a year later, so who knows?) There are great bits by Eleanor Bron and William Daniels as buffoonic American tourists, wonderful locales, great scenery, Henry Mancini music. What more could you ask for? Hepburn in particular is a revelation in this. She never had a more complex role (before or since) and gives what is perhaps her career peak performance. (One wonders what roles she could have played had she not retired soon after this movie came out. She was certainly capable of more than Hollywood demanded of her. What a waste!). She swears (charmingly); commits adultery, even has several semi-nude scenes! She has never looked more beautiful on the screen. This movie is a class act all the way. The kind of sophisticated romance that Hollywood, sadly, doesnt make anymore. (Come to think of it, the genre began to disappear after Hepburn stopped making films...). From Stanley Donen's direction, the wonderfully witty script and editing (characters start a sentence in one time period and end it in another; pass each other on the road...);the gorgeous photography and scenery; Henry Mancini's score (perhaps his best). Its amazing that only the script was nominated for an Oscar (and lost to Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, if you can believe that!) Hepburn was nominated that year but for the far inferior film, Wait Until Dark. This is one of the best and best loved movies from the 60's. Join the cult! Buy it for someone you love! More important SEE it with someone you love! I guarantee its one movie you'll want to watch over and over.

It is a funny, dramatic and an absolute pleasure to watch that will stay in your mind for some time.Starring the lovely Audrey Hepburn and the funny Albert Finney, the story follows a married couple who's flame of relationship has burnt out. The marriage is on the rocks while flashbacks show how their relationship began while both were travelling through Europe.The director, Stanley Donen (who also directed Hepburn in Funny Face (1956) and in Charade (1963)) has made a film that is a true masterpiece. The way the movie is cut and edited is absolutely fasenating and makes the film very great to watch. You will be swinging around from one situation to the next in absolute joy. The characters are great, the situations fun and the romance is delicious. Next to those comedic moments there is also a chunk of drama in the film. It fits perfectly and doesn't feel like it is unnecessary next to the comedy, which is another element that makes the film wortwhile to take a look at. The film is ballanced just fine and isn't hanging too much in one direction.Considering artdirection the movie is true eyecandy. Beautiful, colorful locations are seen throughout the film with an even more beautiful Audrey Hepburn. This film made her the true fashion icon of the sixties. She is prefectly dressed in every single scene and made women all over the world want to be like her even more. Her acting is once again grand, you just can't go wrong with Hepburn. You'll be charmed and enchanted by her looks, personality and that big shiney smile.Albert Finney plays Hepburn's husband, a fun role. He acts great and makes you love him or hate him in the various situations. He is believable even though he is pushing his performance to the beginning of  being unbelievable, which brings great fun to watch and a memorable performance.The music of the famous Henri Manchini (Breakfast at Tiffany's, Charade, The Pink Panter) is beautiful and fits the film perfectly. Emotions are made stronger, situations are made funnier and even more romantic then they already are by this fasenating soundtrack. The main theme will be playing in your mind for some time after seeying this film.So the film is a true enjoyment for both eye and ear. It entertains you, wether by the story, locations, music, that lovely Audrey Hepburn or that funny Albert Finney.

343132,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,6302878527,William Timothy Lukeman,"[4, 4]","As a callow teenager, I didn't think much of this film. Now older & married, I appreciate it more & more each time I see it, discovering something new & insightful with each new viewing. Mark & Joanna seem like old friends to me now.It's a fascinating piece of work, an intersection between the classic era of Hollywood filmmaking (then drawing to an end) & the fresh, experimental techniques of the 1960s. Does this make it a period piece? Well, it's certainly of its time ... but in a good way, as it embodies all the energy & vivid sense of life from that decade. And its somewhat golden, romantic glow is really timeless, since memories of the first days of love are so idealized & wondrous.The cross-cutting between years is especially effective here, reinforcing the sense of memories under review, one leading to another in no particular order. The repetition of certain scenes & lines of dialogue, with VERY different emotional tones over the years, conveys the changes in this marriage succinctly & sharply.And then there's the look of it! Audrey Hepburn & Albert Finney are both stunningly attractive, radiating beauty & sexuality with all the fire of the French sun above their heads. It's particularly good to see Hepburn playing a grown woman in all of her complexity -- while there was never a screen gamine to match hers, she was capable of so much more, and proves it here. Plus, she wears stylish clothes like a dream!Some reviewers have complained about Albert Finney's portrayal of Mark -- self-centered, even brutal in his drive & confidence, so absolutely sure of his handsome irresistibility. But I think those are some of the qualities that attracted Joanna in the first place. She wanted someone to match her ... because of course she's just as aware of her own considerable qualities.Does this make them shallow, self-absorbed? I don't think so. For any couple in love, especially in the prime of youth, there's really nobody else in the world -- certainly nobody else to match themselves. But as time goes by & a little more reality sets in, we see how they struggle & often stumble, trying to adjust to so many changes. Life has a way of overtaking the first blaze of romance, and not every marriage survives it.And that's the question, after all. Can marriage survive the inevitabilities of growing up? ""Two for the Road"" explores that question in a meandering but surprisingly in-depth fashion.

343133,AMMEMPM9MPS55,6302878527,www.DavidLRattigan.com,"[7, 37]","This was clearly an experiment in teaming up the long-established (and ever-charming) Audrey Hepburn with up-and-coming British star Albert Finney, who never did quite go on to become the matinee idol some had hoped, despite getting a good headstart with Tom Jones (1965). Here, however, the match is awkward, and not helped by a fairly witless script and an overall lack of coherence. The thin plot is terribly structured, meandering here and there at a deathly pace, and ending up nowhere in particular.The combination seemed great: Donen directing Hepburn with a snazzy score by easy listening giant Henry Mancini; It was never meant to be, however. This reviewer was left sorely disappointed, wondering where the last two hours of his life had vanished to.",2,Disappointing star vehicle,1039996800,"12 16, 2002",2002,760,"['was', 'clearly', 'experiment', 'teaming', 'up', 'long-established', 'ever-charming', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'up-and-coming', 'British', 'star', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'who', 'never', 'did', 'quite', 'go', 'become', 'matinee', 'idol', 'had', 'hoped', 'getting', 'good', 'headstart', 'Tom', 'Jones', '1965', 'Here', 'however', 'match', 'awkward', 'not', 'helped', 'fairly', 'witless', 'script', 'overall', 'lack', 'coherence', 'thin', 'plot', 'terribly', 'structured', 'meandering', 'here', 'there', 'deathly', 'pace', 'ending', 'up', 'nowhere', 'particular.The', 'combination', 'seemed', 'great', 'Donen', 'directing', 'Hepburn', 'snazzy', 'score', 'easy', 'listening', 'giant', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'however', 'reviewer', 'was', 'left', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'wondering', 'where', 'last', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'had', 'vanished']",N/A
