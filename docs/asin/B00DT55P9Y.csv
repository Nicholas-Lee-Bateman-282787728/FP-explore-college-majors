Most viewers were probably caught off-guard by what they thought they were watching. Kudos for writing & directing to pull that off.3. Although the WWI gas mask seemed rather hokey it did it's job both in terms of the story (we need the couple to be terrified) and audience suspense.Con:1. This plot premise has been used in films before, although this film like all the other films have framed (structure, setting, storyline) each of their stories differently.2. A lot of not-so likely actions by the couple being chased such as stabbing or hitting the assailant once then running off without assuring that person is coming after you. Then there is the always staying close to the place of attack when they can just run away, but of course then there wouldn't be a story. Similarly, the usual less than intelligent hiding behavior.3. The script was inadequate in telling the backstory of the child's death and the parental involvement. Even at the end it didn't come across clearly. Also not clearly explained was the backstory of the pursuers.4. Syrupy moralizing at the end that when we're dead it's just a walk across flowered meadows into the blue sky of eternity.

1661166,A3A0LEB0RPYDEQ,B00DT55P9Y,JT1000,"[6, 10]","The story revolves around a young couple whose relationship is strained with the recent death of their son. One night a young woman shows up at their doorstep looking for help after a car accident and claims someone is after her. Shortly after the masked men arrive and the chase begins.We've seen this formula several times now with people in secluded homes being terrorized by masked assailants but this one's different. It's not as fast paced as The Strangers or even that violent so if you're looking for a bit of action and some gore you might be disappointed with Static. Static is more of a slow burn with more of a focus on the couple's personal problems which at the end you see why that was the focus of the film. In the opening scene you think you know how things are going to turn up but there's a nice twist at the ending which separates it from being just another generic home invasion thriller. Around the 40 minute mark the movie is shot in the dark, which is fine seeing how the power is suppose to have been cut off, but if you're watching this in a well lit  room you might have some trouble seeing what's going on. Other than that the acting and the story is good making it an enjoyable movie to watch.

The logic and common sense of the main characters is lacking greatly. Basically a couple that is grieving a loss decide to stay in the middle of nowhere with limited protection and no security system. They allow a frightened girl seeking safety from others that wish to harm her into their home in the middle of the night. Instead of leaving immediately for safety elsewhere, they decide to stay. The rest of the movie is the consequence of their decision, and the reasons of the attack. The story is basically a hybrid of The Strangers and The Others. The twist at the end was unexpected. I assumed that certain people were indeed the bad guys when they actually were not. There were a few points in the movie when I felt the urge to turn it off or to resume it later. It got a bid repetitive at times, and was a bit slow. However, I continued to watch because the acting was wonderful.

A strange woman shows up at the door of an isolated house in the middle of the night and tries to gain entry.

A handsome couple with emotional baggage being terrorized by an group of menacing outsiders. Why and how is supplied as the film advances. My problem is viewing it in 3D. This film is probably the worse of my collection so far as viewablity is concerned. I can only suspect that the producers released the movie in 3D format to enhance sales. Trust me that would be the only reason. Long narrow hallways and enhanced vista shots (like the driveway into the estate) benefitted from the depth, but inside the close living quarters of the house, most of the background was often out of focus.  Certain scenes would clear up, but shortly thereafter, back to blurred backgrounds.As owners of 3D bluray players have learned, there is not much visual impact in front of the television screen, as there is viewing the movie in theatres. Most of the wonder comes in the depth perception behind the characters on the home theatre screens. I personally have a 60&#34; Samsung in my media room. But continually the background is so blurred in this edition that I have to wonder if this title was released in 3D as a last-minute decision.Try comparing his title with, let's say, &#34;Gravity;&#34; and you'll know what I'm taking about.",3,"Average thriller, somewhat enhanced by 3D",1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,1279,"['plot', 'serviceable', 'movie', 'familar', 'rain', 'handsome', 'couple', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'being', 'terrorized', 'group', 'menacing', 'outsiders', 'Why', 'how', 'supplied', 'film', 'advances', 'problem', 'viewing', '3D', 'film', 'probably', 'worse', 'collection', 'so', 'far', 'viewablity', 'concerned', 'can', 'only', 'suspect', 'producers', 'released', 'movie', '3D', 'format', 'enhance', 'sales', 'Trust', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'reason', 'Long', 'narrow', 'hallways', 'enhanced', 'vista', 'shots', 'driveway', 'estate', 'benefitted', 'depth', 'close', 'living', 'quarters', 'house', 'most', 'background', 'was', 'often', 'focus', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'would', 'clear', 'up', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'back', 'blurred', 'backgrounds.As', 'owners', '3D', 'bluray', 'players', 'have', 'learned', 'not', 'much', 'visual', 'impact', 'front', 'television', 'screen', 'viewing', 'movie', 'theatres', 'Most', 'wonder', 'depth', 'perception', 'characters', 'home', 'theatre', 'screens', 'personally', 'have', '60', '34', 'Samsung', 'media', 'room', 'continually', 'background', 'so', 'blurred', 'edition', 'have', 'wonder', 'title', 'was', 'released', '3D', 'last-minute', 'decision.Try', 'comparing', 'title', 'let', 'say', '34', 'Gravity', '34', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'taking', 'about']",Static
