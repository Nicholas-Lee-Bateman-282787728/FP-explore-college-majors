This older musical realm is quickly being forgotten, in the MTV generation, and, sadly, can now only usually be found in the halls of jazz, blues, and classical music. That said, the emotional power of the performances in this film should not surprise viewers. It is a very visceral, emotional experience because 'real' music is visceral and emotional. And what better way to purvey that power than through the performances of real, accomplished musicians, operating at the peak of their art? This is a glimpse into a world (that of young, talented musicians) that most of us (excluding this reviewer, thank you!) have no knowledge of. As a matter of fact, few persons who are not musicians can appreciate the real, emotional ties that exists between the musician, his chosen instrument, and the music. This movie builds a rather solid story, (about a boy, his father and their ambitions to find the true meaning of their relationship) against a background even more profound, and larger than any of them: the love and, ultimately, the power of the music. It shapes, defines, and clarifies their lives, and, eventually, helps them to determine what they mean to each other. I applaude this as an excellent film, both as a musician, a writer and story-teller, and most importantly, as a human being.",5,The Power of Real Music,1076112000,"02 7, 2004",2004,1527,"['day', 'age', ""'sampled"", ""'pre-arranged"", ""'borrowed"", 'music', ""'canned"", 'performances', 'easy', 'forget', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'immediacy', 'real', 'live', 'musical', 'performances', 'acheived', 'accomplished', 'artists', 'older', 'musical', 'realm', 'quickly', 'being', 'forgotten', 'MTV', 'generation', 'sadly', 'can', 'now', 'only', 'usually', 'be', 'found', 'halls', 'jazz', 'blues', 'classical', 'music', 'said', 'emotional', 'power', 'performances', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'surprise', 'viewers', 'very', 'visceral', 'emotional', 'experience', ""'real"", 'music', 'visceral', 'emotional', 'what', 'better', 'way', 'purvey', 'power', 'performances', 'real', 'accomplished', 'musicians', 'operating', 'peak', 'art', 'glimpse', 'world', 'young', 'talented', 'musicians', 'most', 'excluding', 'reviewer', 'thank', 'have', 'knowledge', 'matter', 'fact', 'few', 'persons', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'musicians', 'can', 'appreciate', 'real', 'emotional', 'ties', 'musician', 'chosen', 'instrument', 'music', 'movie', 'rather', 'solid', 'story', 'boy', 'father', 'ambitions', 'find', 'true', 'meaning', 'relationship', 'background', 'even', 'more', 'profound', 'larger', 'love', 'ultimately', 'power', 'music', 'defines', 'clarifies', 'lives', 'eventually', 'determine', 'what', 'mean', 'other', 'applaude', 'excellent', 'film', 'musician', 'writer', 'story-teller', 'most', 'importantly', 'human', 'being']",N/A

But, in the end, it changes nothing, except that it increases one's respect for Xisochun's dad.  He reminds me very much of the father in the movie 'Smile.'  Xisochun is an adopted child, a foundling.  Throughout most of the movie, we think his father is just a doting father, trying to get the best advantages for his talented son.  Knowing that Xisochun is a foundling, I believe, increases one's admiration for this father.  Everything about this little family is a good example of traditional family values, except that the mother walked out years before (as she did in 'Smile' as well).  Still, this is one reason every family should see this great movie because it shows a self-sacrificing father trying to do the best for his son.  In the end, it comes down to a choice between pursuing success at the expense of family, or putting family ahead of success.  Parents might wish to discuss with their children what the proper balance would be - isn't it possible to maintain both family and success?  If so, how?  Adoptive parents, especially, will like this movie; but, it is a wonderful movie for anyone.[For another unforgettable movie about the undying love of a mother for a foundling in 1800's South Africa, be sure to see 'Fiela's Child,' also available through Amazon.com.]",5,A Great Family Values Movie,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,1355,"['secret', 'movie', 'not', 'made', 'known', 'very', 'end', 'end', 'nothing', 'one', 'respect', 'Xisochun', 'dad', 'very', 'much', 'father', 'movie', 'Xisochun', 'adopted', 'child', 'foundling', 'most', 'movie', 'think', 'father', 'just', 'doting', 'father', 'trying', 'get', 'best', 'advantages', 'talented', 'son', 'Knowing', 'Xisochun', 'foundling', 'believe', 'one', 'admiration', 'father', 'Everything', 'little', 'family', 'good', 'example', 'traditional', 'family', 'values', 'mother', 'walked', 'out', 'years', 'before', 'did', ""'Smile"", 'as', 'well', 'Still', 'one', 'reason', 'family', 'should', 'see', 'great', 'movie', 'self-sacrificing', 'father', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'son', 'end', 'down', 'choice', 'pursuing', 'success', 'expense', 'family', 'putting', 'family', 'ahead', 'success', 'Parents', 'might', 'wish', 'discuss', 'children', 'what', 'proper', 'balance', 'would', 'be', ""n't"", 'possible', 'maintain', 'family', 'success', 'so', 'how', 'Adoptive', 'parents', 'especially', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'anyone', '[', 'unforgettable', 'movie', 'undying', 'love', 'mother', 'foundling', '1800', 'South', 'Africa', 'be', 'sure', 'see', 'Child', 'also', 'available', 'Amazon.com', ']']",N/A
773218,AYP0Z0FLR9Z0R,B0000C2IW6,avoraciousreader,"[6, 15]","Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad film, it's even a good one -- I am just not as wildly enthusiastic about it as so many are.  I rented it with great anticipation, but for the most part was left somewhat cold.  I vacillated between 4* and 3* on this one, but figure it this way:  not as good as the same director's ""Farewell, My Concubine"" or ""Temptress Moon"", which in turn I find a step, or even two, down from many other Asian films such as those of Wong Kar Wai and Tran Anh Hung or ""Song of the Exile"", ""To Live"", or ""A Mongolian Tale"".In brief, this is the story of young 'Chun', Liu Xiaochun [Tang Yun], a country-mouse violin prodigy who comes with his father from the provinces to Beijing to pursue a career.  Without money or connections, he has no chance in the official contest, and studies  with an eccentric teacher, Prof. Jiang.  He also develops a crush on thoroughly modern neighbor Lili [Chen Hong], who lives comfortably through the kindness of male 'friends'.  When Prof. Jiang has taught him how to play from the heart, he transfers to another teacher, the rich Prof. Yu [played by director Chen Kaige] who can help him not only with technique but connection and influence.There were several excellent roles, in particular Chun's father Liu Cheng [Liu Peiqi]whose devotion to his son's career is wholly authentic(perhaps too much to ""career"" per se -- given a choice between Chun's learning to play the best possible, or achieving fame and fortune, he unhesitatingly chooses the latter).  Lili turns out to be a surprisingly well-played and essential character when at a crisis point she transforms from a shallow, self-involved floozy into an earnest, generous and supportive big sister and friend of Cheng's. Prof. Jiang also begins to come out of his slovenly, emotionally lost despond.  Even the normally wooden rival in Prof. Yu's tutelage, Lin Yu [uncredited on my DVD], turns in an excellent scene in which she exposes Prof. Yu's machinations and realizes she truly does love the music, not just the idea of career.  {Unlike a previous reviewer, who recommends editing out or cutting down the roles of Lili and Prof. Jiang, I feel they are much of what makes the film watchable at all.}However, I found the main character, Chun, rather unconvincing.  I only saw flashes of either the love of music or the dedication needed to achieve his goals (whether of fame or skill). Yes, the theme of devotion to music or other performing arts such as dance is a powerful one -- this exposition of that theme just doesn't do it for me.  His actions often seemed poorly motivated, random, or at least as self-involved as Lili.  Likewise, his occasional considerate or generous moments seemed random, not a sign of growing up or transforming.There were several cases of choppy editing (or maybe unclear story flow), from the very start when he wanders away at the train station and we're all of a sudden in the tryouts.  The late revelation of secrets from Chun's early childhood is contrived and unnecessary.  And in the ultimate schmaltzy scene -- play it through in your head without the soundtracked orchestral accompaniment.  A clever cinematic concept, but imagine the reality.",3,"Some good roles, but lacking in heart",1075334400,"01 29, 2004",2004,3201,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'even', 'good', 'one', 'am', 'just', 'not', 'wildly', 'enthusiastic', 'so', 'many', 'are', 'rented', 'great', 'anticipation', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'left', 'somewhat', 'cold', 'vacillated', '4*', '3*', 'one', 'figure', 'way', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'same', 'director', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Concubine', 'Temptress', 'Moon', 'turn', 'find', 'step', 'even', 'two', 'down', 'many', 'other', 'Asian', 'films', 'such', 'Wong', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Tran', 'Anh', 'Hung', 'Song', 'Exile', 'Live', 'Mongolian', 'Tale', '.In', 'brief', 'story', 'young', ""'Chun"", 'Liu', 'Xiaochun', '[', 'Tang', 'Yun', ']', 'country-mouse', 'violin', 'prodigy', 'who', 'father', 'provinces', 'Beijing', 'pursue', 'career', 'money', 'connections', 'chance', 'official', 'contest', 'studies', 'eccentric', 'teacher', 'Prof.', 'Jiang', 'also', 'crush', 'thoroughly', 'modern', 'neighbor', 'Lili', '[', 'Chen', 'Hong', ']', 'who', 'comfortably', 'kindness', 'male', ""'friends"", 'When', 'Prof.', 'Jiang', 'taught', 'how', 'play', 'heart', 'teacher', 'rich', 'Prof.', 'Yu', '[', 'played', 'director', 'Chen', 'Kaige', ']', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'not', 'only', 'technique', 'connection', 'influence.There', 'were', 'several', 'excellent', 'roles', 'particular', 'Chun', 'father', 'Liu', 'Cheng', '[', 'Liu', 'Peiqi', ']', 'devotion', 'son', 'career', 'wholly', 'authentic', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'career', 'se', 'given', 'choice', 'Chun', 'learning', 'play', 'best', 'possible', 'achieving', 'fame', 'fortune', 'unhesitatingly', 'latter', 'Lili', 'out', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'well-played', 'essential', 'character', 'when', 'crisis', 'point', 'shallow', 'self-involved', 'floozy', 'earnest', 'generous', 'supportive', 'big', 'sister', 'friend', 'Cheng', 'Prof.', 'Jiang', 'also', 'come', 'slovenly', 'emotionally', 'lost', 'despond', 'Even', 'normally', 'wooden', 'rival', 'Prof.', 'Yu', 'tutelage', 'Lin', 'Yu', '[', 'uncredited', 'DVD', ']', 'excellent', 'scene', 'Prof.', 'Yu', 'machinations', 'truly', 'love', 'music', 'not', 'just', 'idea', 'career', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'who', 'editing', 'out', 'cutting', 'down', 'roles', 'Lili', 'Prof.', 'Jiang', 'feel', 'are', 'much', 'what', 'film', 'watchable', 'However', 'found', 'main', 'character', 'Chun', 'rather', 'unconvincing', 'only', 'saw', 'flashes', 'love', 'music', 'dedication', 'needed', 'achieve', 'goals', 'fame', 'skill', 'Yes', 'theme', 'devotion', 'music', 'other', 'performing', 'arts', 'such', 'dance', 'powerful', 'one', 'exposition', 'theme', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'actions', 'often', 'seemed', 'poorly', 'motivated', 'random', 'least', 'as', 'self-involved', 'Lili', 'Likewise', 'occasional', 'considerate', 'generous', 'moments', 'seemed', 'random', 'not', 'sign', 'growing', 'up', 'were', 'several', 'cases', 'choppy', 'editing', 'maybe', 'unclear', 'story', 'flow', 'very', 'start', 'when', 'away', 'train', 'station', ""'re"", 'sudden', 'tryouts', 'late', 'revelation', 'secrets', 'Chun', 'early', 'childhood', 'contrived', 'unnecessary', 'ultimate', 'schmaltzy', 'scene', 'play', 'head', 'soundtracked', 'orchestral', 'accompaniment', 'clever', 'cinematic', 'concept', 'imagine', 'reality']",N/A

Not just in music, which is the focus of this movie, but in appliances, clothes, malls, the drive for success, etc.  The Chinese are not all that different from us.On another level there is the rebelliousness and naivety of the youngster.  He may be a musical genius, but in other matters he is just a 14 year old, acting impulsively, doing stupid things at times, and forming unconventional relationships.Then there is the relationship the boy has with his teachers.  One of them appears not too far from his peasant roots but the other one is cosmopolitan, with a degree of renown.  They both feel a certain love for the boy, as does everyone whom he meets.Beijing is a modern city, but like any other city, including those in America, there are pockets of poverty.  But it is a large, busy, vibrant city, with room for everyone.The main focus of the plot is the boy and his virtuosity.  Nature or nurture?

In one of the early scenes he  plays his violin music to ease the pain of child-birth by a young lady in the next room. Xiaochen's father is a humble cook in a popular local restaurant who is very proud of his son's unique violin playing talent. The father sacrifices his life-savings and security by moving to Beijing to secure violin-lessons to enhance the son's natural talent. The father over-hears two people praising the musical abilities of an eccentric violin teacher during a performance at a music academy. The father is subsumed by his goal to develop the skills of his son, an unpolished violin-playing child prodigy. The teacher-pupil relationship is strong but eventually is strained due to a contest of wills when Xiaochen proves his violin skills are equal (perhaps greater) than those of his teacher. The dad realizes his son requires a more challenging environment and seeks to find a professor with more musical knowledge and vision. There are several themes that are thoroughly explored within this film. The first is ... will Xiaochen eventually understand and appreciate how much his dad has personally sacrificed for his son to succeed? Another theme reveals how two provincial people manage to survive in Beijing, a major hustling and bustling city. The third theme explores whether or not Xiaochen will achieve the discipline required to polish and refine his natural violin playing skills to become a prize-winning performer and bring honor to his father.When they first arrive in the railroad station at Beijing, the crowds are overwhelming. The dad appears to a country bumpkin who eventually develops street-wise savvy and survival skills in the city. He finds a job as a bicycle-riding courier. While searching for an apartment with his dad, Xiaochen sees a self-centered beautiful young lady, on whom he develops an adolscent crush. It turns out she is a resident at the same apartment building where they live. The young lady has male admirers who shower her with gifts but unfortunately, one special boyfriend eludes her. When she sees him out with another woman, she creates a scene in which she contrives to be the betrayed wife, feigning Xiaochen  to be their son whom the father appears to have neglected. This is one of many amusing scenes in the film.One of the major conficts in the film revolves around Xiaochen's huge adolescent blunder, he sells his one valuable possession, his violin, to buy Lili, the love of his life, a mink coat she desired. The remainder of the film attempts to resolve the problems created by this major catastrophe. New tensions arise between father and son. The father through hook and by crook obtains a position for Xiaochen with one of the finest music professors at the academy. Xiaochen proves he has the moxie and discipline to further refine his violin playing. The climatic resolution is reached as Xiaochen proves he deserves the trust, faith and love his father has given him. The musical performances are explosive and riveting.

TOGETHER is a tender story that can be viewed from many vantages - the contemporary social climate in China, the profound impact of selfless love, the quantum difference between music that is technically perfect vs music that is from the heart and soul of the performer, the struggle for existance in the big city for the poor citizens visiting from the provinces, the awakening rattle of puberty in a guileless child.Liu Cheng (in a beautifully realize performance by Peiqi Liu ) is the 'father' of a gifted young violinist Liu Xiaochun (realistically acted by young violinist Yun Tang ) and when it becomes apparent that the child has won all the local prizes for his musicianship that his little town in Southern China affords, the father saves money and moves to Beijing for advanced studies.  One professor (Zhiwen Wang ) lives the life of the bohemian, as interested in his home for feral cats as he is in hearing his pupil learn.  The gift he provides is to emphasize that Liu Xiaochun always play from the heart. The next professor (played with great tenderness by director Kaige Chen ) guides him up to the point of winning a National Competition, a goal which obviously will satisfy everyone concerned - except Lin Xiaochun, who has gently fallen in love with the waif Lili (the gorgeous  Hong Chen, wife of the film's Director).  When it is discovered that Lin Xiaochun's father is returning to his home in the provinces - his work and dream accomplished - the son slowly discovers that his 'father' was simply a man who saved the unwanted child from a bench near a violin, and that knowledge that one man could love him that much to make a life for him changes the course of the action and...See the film.Throughout this visually stunning production (the southern province looks like an Asian Venice)the background music is all violin solos and concerti and while the actors actually play on the screen (the best I've ever seen), the score was recorded with the gifted Chinese violinist Li Chuan Yun providing exquisite technique and passion after the filming was completed.The technique of using black and white flashback sequences to tell the real relationship between father and son is subtle and in keeping with the tone of the film.

Most films that I've seen that deal with young prodigy musicians often deal with slave-driven kids and overbearing parents.  THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.  Sometimes, I think we forget that many prodigies work hard at their craft not because they were being forced to success, but because the music they make is a pure  resonance of their feelings and passions...but this is probably because it's harder to make a popularly entertaining film without all the darker intrigues.  Fortunately, this film succeeds to a great degree without those dark themes.This film deals with two major issues: 1) Philosophy of music 2) What makes a true Father and Son relationship (let alone family).  Don't worry, I won't go into details about those because if I did, I would be ruining the plot for you.  But I will say this, it was a very pleasant surprise and very fitting that it was my own Dad that got this film for me one day.  Very heartwarming, it makes you think.  It's not flashy, but there are beautiful plot twists.

First of all, the locale is mainland China. Secondly, our hero, a teenage male, isn't seduced by an older woman into his first sexual encounter. This is obviously not a Hollywood-made picture.Liu Xiaochun (Tang Yun) is a 13 year-old, phenomenally talented, classical violinist, who lives in a provincial Chinese town with his father, Liu Cheng (Liu Peiqi), a single-parent. The boy wins the opportunity to vie in a major competition in Beijing, so the two set off to the Big City with all of Dad's savings stuffed in his cap.In Beijing, Xiaochun places 5th. (As it turns out, he would have likely won if not for the bribes paid on behalf of the top 4.) In any case, he's denied entrance into the Conservatory because he and his father have no official permits to live in the city. So, after finding the rough lodgings suited to technically illegal residents, they set about hiring a private tutor to hone Xiaochun's skills.While Tang Yun plays the lead, he is, for much of the film, inscrutable. It's not clear if Tang Yun does his own violin work. If so, then he should perhaps give up acting and go on tour as a classical violinist because that's his greatest talent. My favorite performance was that of Liu Peiqi, who is stellar as the embodiment of country bumpkin in demeanor, mannerisms and dress in the environment of the relatively sophisticated capital.For the viewer, TOGETHER is a wealth of engaging plots and subplots. The main thread of the storyline, that of finding a tutor for Xiaochun, is neatly split into two as first one, Prof. Jiang (Wang Zhiwen) is discovered, and then a second, Prof. Yu Shifeng (Chen Kaige - also the film's director). The boy's time with the latter incorporates a minor aside involving Lin Yu (Zhang Qing), a girl student competing with Xiaochun for Shifeng's favor. Overlaying all this, and providing a comedic element, is Xiaochun's platonic infatuation with Lili (Chen Hong - also the film director's wife), who lives in a comfortable apartment nearby to the hovel shared by Liu Cheng and his son. Lili is apparently a working girl whose companionship is available for hire by well-off males, although the presumed sexual nature of this arrangement is never explicitly made clear.My only complaint regarding TOGETHER is that delivery of the story's message, i.e. that feelings are more important than technique when it comes to playing a musical instrument, is prolonged. The film would have benefited greatly from judicious editing, which, in my opinion, should have deleted the Prof. Jiang character entirely, reduced the involvement of Lili, and expanded the interaction between Xiaochun, Shifeng, and Lin Yu. I say this even though the director's occasionally mesmerizing use of light is best exemplified during the scene when Jiang finally comes out of the funk brought on by a long ago lost love.TOGETHER is an elegantly artistic film to watch and savor.",4,A lesson on feelings,1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,3062,"['TOGETHER', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'emotionally', 'mature', 'members', 'U.S.', 'audience', 'should', 'find', 'exotically', 'different', 'standard', 'fare', 'genre', 'First', 'all', 'locale', 'mainland', 'China', 'Secondly', 'hero', 'teenage', 'male', ""n't"", 'seduced', 'older', 'woman', 'first', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'obviously', 'not', 'Hollywood-made', 'picture.Liu', 'Xiaochun', 'Tang', 'Yun', '13', 'year-old', 'phenomenally', 'talented', 'classical', 'violinist', 'who', 'provincial', 'Chinese', 'town', 'father', 'Liu', 'Cheng', 'Liu', 'Peiqi', 'single-parent', 'boy', 'opportunity', 'vie', 'major', 'competition', 'Beijing', 'two', 'set', 'Big', 'City', 'Dad', 'savings', 'stuffed', 'cap.In', 'Beijing', 'Xiaochun', '5th', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'likely', 'won', 'not', 'bribes', 'paid', 'behalf', 'top', '4', 'case', 'denied', 'entrance', 'Conservatory', 'father', 'have', 'official', 'permits', 'live', 'city', 'So', 'finding', 'rough', 'lodgings', 'suited', 'technically', 'illegal', 'residents', 'set', 'hiring', 'private', 'tutor', 'hone', 'Xiaochun', 'skills.While', 'Tang', 'Yun', 'lead', 'much', 'film', 'inscrutable', 'not', 'clear', 'Tang', 'Yun', 'own', 'violin', 'work', 'so', 'then', 'should', 'perhaps', 'give', 'up', 'acting', 'go', 'tour', 'classical', 'violinist', 'greatest', 'talent', 'favorite', 'performance', 'was', 'Liu', 'Peiqi', 'who', 'stellar', 'embodiment', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'demeanor', 'mannerisms', 'dress', 'environment', 'relatively', 'sophisticated', 'capital.For', 'viewer', 'TOGETHER', 'wealth', 'engaging', 'plots', 'subplots', 'main', 'thread', 'storyline', 'finding', 'tutor', 'Xiaochun', 'neatly', 'split', 'two', 'first', 'one', 'Prof.', 'Jiang', 'Wang', 'Zhiwen', 'discovered', 'then', 'second', 'Prof.', 'Yu', 'Shifeng', 'Chen', 'Kaige', 'also', 'film', 'director', 'boy', 'time', 'latter', 'minor', 'aside', 'involving', 'Lin', 'Yu', 'Zhang', 'Qing', 'girl', 'student', 'competing', 'Xiaochun', 'Shifeng', 'favor', 'Overlaying', 'providing', 'comedic', 'element', 'Xiaochun', 'platonic', 'infatuation', 'Lili', 'Chen', 'Hong', 'also', 'film', 'director', 'wife', 'who', 'comfortable', 'apartment', 'nearby', 'hovel', 'shared', 'Liu', 'Cheng', 'son', 'Lili', 'apparently', 'working', 'girl', 'companionship', 'available', 'hire', 'well-off', 'males', 'presumed', 'sexual', 'nature', 'arrangement', 'never', 'explicitly', 'made', 'clear.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'regarding', 'TOGETHER', 'delivery', 'story', 'message', 'i.e', 'feelings', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'technique', 'when', 'playing', 'musical', 'instrument', 'prolonged', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'greatly', 'judicious', 'editing', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'deleted', 'Prof.', 'Jiang', 'character', 'entirely', 'reduced', 'involvement', 'Lili', 'expanded', 'interaction', 'Xiaochun', 'Shifeng', 'Lin', 'Yu', 'say', 'even', 'director', 'occasionally', 'mesmerizing', 'use', 'light', 'best', 'exemplified', 'scene', 'when', 'Jiang', 'finally', 'funk', 'brought', 'long', 'ago', 'lost', 'love.TOGETHER', 'elegantly', 'artistic', 'film', 'watch', 'savor']",N/A

Here is a very very touching father-son drama with many bitter sweet moments and strange characters. cat lover Prof Jiang, spoiled but good hearted call girl mimi and liu cheng with his unnervingly funny neverending shame of being a poor villager .Kaige portrays the emergence of new china with shopping malls, peoples struggles to adapt the new lifestyles which are mostly western oriented and confusion over the transformation from old school socialism to market economy.Movie raises an eyebrow on issues like success and career and the price that has to be paid on them. Also family ties, people's dependence on each other and family ties that can never be broken are all here, making the young talents story richer and down to earth as it can be.Together is a very good introduction of Kaige to wider audiences.Movie is very touching but as well as funny and interesting. So sensitive viewers are advised to be prepared before watching.Only problem with this movie is for the appreciators of his early work and serious cinema critics, no matter how successful this movie is, it will always stay under the shadow of Kaige's earlier work like farewell my concubine and will raise an undeniable feeling of dissapointment among these people, fans of his early works of art cinema.

Despite that Together is not as sumptuous as Farewell My Concubine and not as grand as the Emperor and the Assasin, it is nevertheless a moving story about a father and son.  Well, the story is predictable enough but personally, it's the honesty and concentration of the Director towards the main essentials in Together that made it such an enjoyable watch.  The peasant father took the son to Beijing, the big city to find a good violin teacher, who hopefully would lead his son to fame and fortune.  Along their way, their lives cross path with a talented and honest but undisciplined teacher, a gold digger woman who never cares for anyone or anything in her life.  Those people's lives are about to change subsequently as their lives are directly and indirectly moved by the father and son's sincerities.  Towards the second half of the movie, the nice teacher reaffirms the father's decision to change for yet another teacher who has connections to ensure that the son's career path would be a successful one.  In the end, albeit fame and fortune, the movie questions us if that's what we seek for in life or for love and happiness.  Be prepared for a twist in the movie.  A movie about friendship, sacrifice, and love.  Together also allows us to catch a glimpse of the modernising China, about who you know and what you know that get you places, and about the social structures in China.

Thanks to some adroit filmmaking, there's more a sense of life than of plot devices being played out here.  The filial relationship between father and son is warmly and fully developed, with much of what passes between them being implied and unspoken.  The teacher and the prostitute also feel more fully rounded than they otherwise might in lesser hands.
