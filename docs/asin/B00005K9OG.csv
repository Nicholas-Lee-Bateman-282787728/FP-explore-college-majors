As would be expected he gets it back just in time but thats typical for the plot of theese movies. Its how they get there that makes it good. I dont want to be a spoiler. You should get it.

It does both of these in great fashion.Santa is out riding in his sleigh, hits some turbulence and falls to earth. He lands on the car of a TV reporter who is in need of a Christmas story for his newscast, and loses his memory. This reporter had long ago lost his ability to believe in Santa. Of course the viewer must suspend reality and accept the situation to fully enjoy the results of this story. Someone looking only for a funny film will be disappointed as it is not played strictly for laughs. Leslie Neilsen has played a real Santa before (All I Want For Christmas) and does a great job here as a befuddled person trying to remember who he really is. Again, someone expecting an over the top comic performance will not be amused, but this is meant as a FAMILY film and really succeedes.Of course, being a Christmas story, the reporter regains his faith in Santa and in himself and, just in time, Santa regains his memory. Even Scrooge would know this was going to happen.This began as a TV movie on the Sunday Night Disney program last Christmas. I'd taped it then and have watched it a number of times since. Now it is great to have it on DVD without commercials.If you are one of those people who thinks anyone with Merry Christmas on his lips should be buried with a stake of holly through his heart (sorry Mr. Dickens), don't watch this film, but for anyone looking for a nice, smile involking 88 minutes of Christmas fantasy, get this DVD.",5,Santa With Amnesia - Fun Story,1005609600,"11 13, 2001",2001,1576,"['type', 'film', 'fun', 'put', 'when', 'spirits', 'need', 'be', 'lifted', 'want', 'bring', 'smile', 'face', 'great', 'fashion.Santa', 'out', 'riding', 'sleigh', 'turbulence', 'earth', 'car', 'TV', 'reporter', 'who', 'need', 'Christmas', 'story', 'newscast', 'memory', 'reporter', 'had', 'long', 'ago', 'lost', 'ability', 'believe', 'Santa', 'course', 'viewer', 'must', 'suspend', 'reality', 'accept', 'situation', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'results', 'story', 'Someone', 'looking', 'only', 'funny', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'not', 'played', 'strictly', 'laughs', 'Leslie', 'Neilsen', 'played', 'real', 'Santa', 'Want', 'Christmas', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'befuddled', 'person', 'trying', 'remember', 'who', 'really', 'Again', 'someone', 'expecting', 'top', 'comic', 'performance', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'amused', 'meant', 'FAMILY', 'film', 'really', 'succeedes.Of', 'course', 'being', 'Christmas', 'story', 'reporter', 'faith', 'Santa', 'just', 'time', 'Santa', 'memory', 'Even', 'Scrooge', 'would', 'know', 'was', 'going', 'happen.This', 'began', 'TV', 'movie', 'Sunday', 'Night', 'Disney', 'program', 'last', 'Christmas', ""'d"", 'taped', 'then', 'have', 'watched', 'number', 'times', 'Now', 'great', 'have', 'DVD', 'commercials.If', 'are', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'anyone', 'Merry', 'Christmas', 'lips', 'should', 'be', 'buried', 'stake', 'holly', 'heart', 'sorry', 'Mr.', 'Dickens', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'anyone', 'looking', 'nice', 'smile', 'involking', '88', 'minutes', 'Christmas', 'fantasy', 'get', 'DVD']",N/A

I gave it five stars because I found it to be a very enjoyable movie. Sadly, I have it on VHS and I do not have a working VCR, nor can I afford it on a DVD, so I will have to wait until Christas of 2010 to enjoy it. The movie has been around long enough for most to know the plots, beginning with Santa landing on the roof of a reporter's car who doesn't believe in Santa. He has been dating a woman with a young son and while he desires her he does not desire the son. The son, of course, believes Nick is Santa Claus while Peter, the reporter, doesn't. Throughout the movie we are entertained by the sights and sounds of Christmas, such as Salvaton Army and department store Santas, decorated trees, Christmas music, and carolers. Since it is a Christmas movie, we expect, and get, a happy ending, and two children get the surprise of their life early Christmas morning. While it is true this is not the stuff of The Bells of St. Mary's, A Christmas Carol (whichever version or versions you watch), It's a Wonderful Life, or Miracle on 34th Street, it does make me laugh (I like it when a guard has to phone his boss and tell him Santa and his elves are stealing the reindeer), and feel good, especially listening to Jingle Bell Rock at the end (which was left off of the movie when I just watched it on tv and that sucked). I recommend it to families and singles alike.",5,Another Improbable Christmas Movie,1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,1527,"['Santa', 'coming', 'down', 'amnesia', 'tall', 'elves', 'letters', 'Santa', 'thrown', 'fireplace', 'child-hating', 'bachelor', 'getting', 'married', 'woman', 'child', 'gave', 'five', 'stars', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Sadly', 'have', 'VHS', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'working', 'VCR', 'can', 'afford', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'Christas', '2010', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'been', 'long', 'enough', 'most', 'know', 'plots', 'beginning', 'Santa', 'landing', 'roof', 'reporter', 'car', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Santa', 'been', 'dating', 'woman', 'young', 'son', 'not', 'desire', 'son', 'son', 'course', 'Nick', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Peter', 'reporter', ""n't"", 'Throughout', 'movie', 'are', 'entertained', 'sights', 'sounds', 'Christmas', 'such', 'Salvaton', 'Army', 'department', 'store', 'Santas', 'decorated', 'trees', 'Christmas', 'music', 'carolers', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'expect', 'get', 'happy', 'ending', 'two', 'children', 'get', 'surprise', 'life', 'early', 'Christmas', 'morning', 'true', 'not', 'stuff', 'Bells', 'St.', 'Mary', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'whichever', 'version', 'versions', 'watch', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Miracle', '34th', 'Street', 'make', 'like', 'when', 'guard', 'phone', 'boss', 'tell', 'Santa', 'elves', 'are', 'stealing', 'reindeer', 'feel', 'good', 'especially', 'listening', 'Jingle', 'Bell', 'Rock', 'end', 'was', 'left', 'movie', 'when', 'just', 'watched', 'tv', 'sucked', 'recommend', 'families', 'singles', 'alike']",N/A

A story about Santa losing his memory of just who he is just prior to the main part of the Christmas season possibly doesn't promise much however in the most capable hands of Leslie Nielsen, and with excellent support from the underrated Steve Eckholdt as cynical newsman Peter Albright, the opposite is definately the case. What we get in ""Santa Who?"", is a delightfully funny and at times very touching account of not just one but actually two men's search to try and find out just who they actually are. Both men's search for an identity resulting from very different circumstances; ie Santa as a result of an accident while out driving his sleigh, and Peter, due to a lifetime devoid of love and caring from anyone, becomes a mutually enriching journey for them creating a touching bond between the two men who normally are as different as night and day but who through the chain of events that unfold become better people for the experience.",5,Amusing Twist On Santa's Story With A Perfectly Cast Leslie Nielsen,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,1120,"['who', 'like', 'just', 'adore', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'wacky', 'roles', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'series', 'films', 'delightful', 'little', 'Christmas', 'television', 'movie', 'essential', 'viewing', 'story', 'Santa', 'losing', 'memory', 'just', 'who', 'just', 'prior', 'main', 'part', 'Christmas', 'season', 'possibly', ""n't"", 'promise', 'much', 'however', 'most', 'capable', 'hands', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'excellent', 'support', 'underrated', 'Steve', 'Eckholdt', 'cynical', 'newsman', 'Peter', 'Albright', 'opposite', 'definately', 'case', 'What', 'get', 'Santa', 'Who', 'delightfully', 'funny', 'times', 'very', 'touching', 'account', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'actually', 'two', 'men', 'search', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'who', 'actually', 'are', 'men', 'search', 'identity', 'resulting', 'very', 'different', 'circumstances', 'Santa', 'result', 'accident', 'out', 'driving', 'sleigh', 'Peter', 'due', 'lifetime', 'devoid', 'love', 'caring', 'anyone', 'mutually', 'enriching', 'journey', 'creating', 'touching', 'bond', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'normally', 'are', 'as', 'different', 'night', 'day', 'who', 'chain', 'events', 'unfold', 'become', 'better', 'people', 'experience']",N/A
