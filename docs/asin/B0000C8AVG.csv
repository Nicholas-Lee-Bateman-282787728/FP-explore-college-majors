774037,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B0000C8AVG,Alex Udvary,"[6, 8]","Near the beginning of this film a character calls Wheeler and Woolsey ""delightfully unfunny"", talk about truth in advertising!I'm not a big fan of Wheeler and Woolsey's comedy but I continue to watch their films mostly because they are rare. I've seen 7 of their films, TCM has been playing them quite often. Their films are harmless but, for me, not very engaging. Wheeler and Woolsey were a very popular comedy team for RKO in the 1930s but time has not been kind to them. How do I know they were popular? Because they made 21 films together. Let me tell you the way Hollywood works, they won't let you keep making films if they get nothing out of it. So someone was watching their films.In the past I've defended Laurel & Hardy's 1940s films such as ""Saps at Sea"", ""Air Raid Wardens"", and ""A Chump at Oxford"". I've even defended Buster Keaton's talking pictures; ""Bedroom, Bath & Parlor"", ""Speak Easily"", and ""The Passionate Plumber"" and while I find Wheeler and Woolsey just as harmless and light as those films they have not left as big an impression on me. Rest a sured there is ALWAYS at least one good gag in their films. If it's really good there are two or three, the films are too short for there to be more. But as time has shown their comedy isn't as fresh as Chaplin, Laurel & Hardy, Bob Hope or the Marx Brothers.""Hook, Line and Sinker"" was the team's fifth film and was directed by Edward F. Cline. Who had directed W.C. Fields in ""The Bank Dick"" and ""My Little Chickadee"" and directed Wheeler and Woolsey in two other films ""Cracked Nuts"" and ""High Flyers"" (their last film). The plot has Wheeler and Woolsey as insurance salesman, who go into the hotel business at the sight of a pretty girl, Mary Marsh (Dorothy Lee, who appeared several times with the team including their first film ""Rio Rita""). Marsh is running away from home because she does not want to marry the man her mother has chosen for her. When Wheeler sees her he instantly falls for her and wants to help her run her hotel, which has been abandon for years.To be honest the plot isn't important. The whole reason we are going to wtach this film is strickly because we want to see Wheeler and Woolsey, right? At first I found the film slow, but slowly started having a good time and managed to actually have a smile on my face, could I actually start becoming a fan?I wrote a review for their film ""Kentucky Kernels"" and at the time I thought that was their best film. I've since changed my mind as I've seen more films by them. I now think ""Peach-O-Reno"" is the best with ""Hook, Line and Sinker"" a distant second.The film has some bright spots near the end and Woolsey, while not in the ranks of Bob Hope or Groucho Marx, can deliver a one-liner. I found a scene between Wheeler and Lee involving a gun out of character but again the film is worth seeing if for any reason because it's rare. And I even look forward to seeing more of their films in the future.Bottom-line: Slightly better than most of the Wheeler and Woolsey films I've seen. Has some good moments here and there. It's a harmless silly movie good for those of us who enjoy comedies from the time period.",3,"""Hooked"" On Wheeler & Woolsey?",1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,3155,"['beginning', 'film', 'character', 'Wheeler', 'Woolsey', 'delightfully', 'unfunny', 'talk', 'truth', 'advertising', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Wheeler', 'Woolsey', 'comedy', 'continue', 'watch', 'films', 'mostly', 'are', 'rare', ""'ve"", 'seen', '7', 'films', 'TCM', 'been', 'playing', 'quite', 'often', 'films', 'are', 'harmless', 'not', 'very', 'engaging', 'Wheeler', 'Woolsey', 'were', 'very', 'popular', 'comedy', 'team', 'RKO', '1930s', 'time', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'were', 'popular', 'made', '21', 'films', 'together', 'Let', 'tell', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'works', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'keep', 'making', 'films', 'get', 'nothing', 'someone', 'was', 'watching', 'films.In', 'past', ""'ve"", 'defended', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', '1940s', 'films', 'such', 'Saps', 'Sea', 'Air', 'Raid', 'Wardens', 'Chump', 'Oxford', ""'ve"", 'even', 'defended', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'talking', 'pictures', 'Bedroom', 'Bath', 'Parlor', 'Speak', 'Easily', 'Passionate', 'Plumber', 'find', 'Wheeler', 'Woolsey', 'just', 'harmless', 'light', 'films', 'have', 'not', 'left', 'big', 'impression', 'Rest', 'sured', 'ALWAYS', 'least', 'one', 'good', 'gag', 'films', 'really', 'good', 'are', 'two', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'be', 'more', 'time', 'shown', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'as', 'fresh', 'Chaplin', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'Hook', 'Line', 'Sinker', 'was', 'team', 'fifth', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Edward', 'F.', 'Cline', 'Who', 'had', 'directed', 'W.C.', 'Fields', 'Bank', 'Dick', 'Little', 'Chickadee', 'directed', 'Wheeler', 'Woolsey', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'Cracked', 'Nuts', 'High', 'Flyers', 'last', 'film', 'plot', 'Wheeler', 'Woolsey', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'who', 'go', 'hotel', 'business', 'sight', 'pretty', 'girl', 'Mary', 'Marsh', 'Dorothy', 'Lee', 'who', 'appeared', 'several', 'times', 'team', 'including', 'first', 'film', 'Rio', 'Rita', 'Marsh', 'running', 'away', 'home', 'not', 'want', 'marry', 'man', 'mother', 'chosen', 'When', 'Wheeler', 'instantly', 'help', 'run', 'hotel', 'been', 'abandon', 'years.To', 'be', 'honest', 'plot', ""n't"", 'important', 'whole', 'reason', 'are', 'going', 'wtach', 'film', 'strickly', 'want', 'see', 'Wheeler', 'Woolsey', 'right', 'first', 'found', 'film', 'slow', 'slowly', 'started', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'managed', 'actually', 'have', 'smile', 'face', 'could', 'actually', 'start', 'becoming', 'fan', 'wrote', 'review', 'film', 'Kentucky', 'Kernels', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'films', 'now', 'think', 'Peach-O-Reno', 'best', 'Hook', 'Line', 'Sinker', 'distant', 'second.The', 'film', 'bright', 'spots', 'end', 'Woolsey', 'not', 'ranks', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'can', 'deliver', 'one-liner', 'found', 'scene', 'Wheeler', 'Lee', 'involving', 'gun', 'character', 'again', 'film', 'seeing', 'reason', 'rare', 'even', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'films', 'future.Bottom-line', 'Slightly', 'better', 'most', 'Wheeler', 'Woolsey', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'harmless', 'silly', 'movie', 'good', 'who', 'enjoy', 'comedies', 'time', 'period']","Hook, Line and Sinker"
774038,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,B0000C8AVG,Andrew McCaffrey,"[4, 6]","Although the DVD cover proclaims Wheeler and Woolsey as ""one of America's most beloved comedy duos"", they are not one of the best remembered.  As a reminder (or an introduction), Bert Wheeler is the younger, wavy-haired member of the team and Robert Woolsey is the one who looks like the offspring of George Burns and Groucho Marx, with the cigar, glasses and the part in the center of his hair that looks like it was done using an X-Acto knife.  They made quite a large number of films together in the 1930s, but the team hasn't really stood the test of time the way that Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, other comedy teams of that time have.  The few films of theirs that I have seen are mostly inoffensive -- nothing spectacular, but an entertaining diversion for a couple of hours.HOOK, LINE AND SINKER fulfills that description in everything but the time-factor (this movie is only sixty-two minutes long).  The plot can be summarized quite quickly.  Two insurance salesmen quit their gig and get into the hotel business after meeting a young heiress.  Naturally, a bunch of scam artists, thieves and crooks show up for the hotel's grand re-opening, intent on stealing all the goods they can get their hands on.  The DVD box blurb refers to the villains as ""oddball characters"", but I found them mostly bland and uninteresting.  The one thing I kept thinking about was that the ""Duchess"" character really ought to have been played by Thelma Todd.However, the story is mostly irrelevant.  The movie is basically an excuse to have Wheeler and Woolsey stand next to each other (occasionally with a third person) and fire off one-liners at each other.  This is a typical exchange:Policeman: ""You broke a traffic law!""Woolsey: ""Can't you make another one?""The comedy is very vaudevillian in nature and is a corny mixture of puns, word play and simple misunderstandings.  The production is very stagey, with the plot used mainly to move the characters from one set to another to mix up the background on which the jokes are told.  If you're in the mood for this, it can be quite enjoyable.  If you have a low tolerance for cheap wisecracks and dumb humor, then you may want to stay away.  Personally, I enjoyed the film.  But that said, I only picked it up because I discovered it selling for an entire dollar.  I can't imagine myself watching it many more times.The DVD edition I'm reviewing is the Digiview Productions release.  The picture quality is quite bad, but it's hard to say whether the fault lies in laziness/cheapness at the DVD company or the age of the material.  Certainly, there exist other movies from this era in much better condition, but one can't tell whether this print simply had a harder time than others over the last seventy-five years.  The picture is blurry and out of focus in spots.  The framing seems a bit off too, so there are a few scenes where the actors' heads are cut off.  The sound quality is also not stellar, being tinny, muffled and scratchy.That said, this is not a CITIZEN KANE where the viewer's inner film student will be scanning the background looking for hitherto unseen details.  This is just a cheaply made, quick comedy where the poorness of the DVD doesn't really detract much from the overall experience.  On the other hand, there were a few gags rendered nonsensical by the medium.  For example, at one point a woman con artist is walking up a flight of steps when out of nowhere there is a smallish explosion behind her.  I presume we were supposed to see a grenade or the like falling out of her handbag, but with the picture quality being so poor, it looks like she just stepped on a landmine.Another difficult-to-see gag occurs when Wheeler and the heiress love-interest (played by Dorothy Lee, a frequent collaborator with W/W) haggle over how many children they should have in married life.  They keep punching up numbers on an old cash register, but the poor DVD picture quality leaves the audience bewildered as to what figures they are discussing.The more I watch the films of Wheeler and Woolsey, the more I like them.  I can't see them ever seriously rivaling my affection for other comedy stars of that era, but they have a kind of innocent charm to them.  HOOK, LINE AND SINKER is a pleasant way of spending an hour.",3,"""People are dying this year who have never died before...""",1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,4288,"['DVD', 'cover', 'Wheeler', 'Woolsey', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'beloved', 'comedy', 'duos', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'remembered', 'reminder', 'introduction', 'Bert', 'Wheeler', 'younger', 'wavy-haired', 'member', 'team', 'Robert', 'Woolsey', 'one', 'who', 'offspring', 'George', 'Burns', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'cigar', 'glasses', 'part', 'center', 'hair', 'was', 'done', 'using', 'X-Acto', 'knife', 'made', 'quite', 'large', 'number', 'films', 'together', '1930s', 'team', ""n't"", 'really', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'way', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'other', 'comedy', 'teams', 'time', 'have', 'few', 'films', 'theirs', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'mostly', 'inoffensive', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'entertaining', 'diversion', 'couple', 'hours.HOOK', 'LINE', 'AND', 'SINKER', 'description', 'everything', 'time-factor', 'movie', 'only', 'sixty-two', 'minutes', 'long', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'summarized', 'quite', 'quickly', 'Two', 'insurance', 'salesmen', 'quit', 'gig', 'get', 'hotel', 'business', 'meeting', 'young', 'heiress', 'Naturally', 'bunch', 'scam', 'artists', 'thieves', 'crooks', 'show', 'up', 'hotel', 'grand', 're-opening', 'intent', 'stealing', 'goods', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'DVD', 'box', 'blurb', 'refers', 'villains', 'oddball', 'characters', 'found', 'mostly', 'bland', 'uninteresting', 'one', 'thing', 'kept', 'thinking', 'about', 'was', 'Duchess', 'character', 'really', 'ought', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'Thelma', 'Todd.However', 'story', 'mostly', 'irrelevant', 'movie', 'basically', 'excuse', 'have', 'Wheeler', 'Woolsey', 'stand', 'next', 'other', 'occasionally', 'third', 'person', 'fire', 'off', 'one-liners', 'other', 'typical', 'exchange', 'Policeman', 'broke', 'traffic', 'law', 'Woolsey', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'one', 'comedy', 'very', 'vaudevillian', 'nature', 'corny', 'mixture', 'puns', 'word', 'play', 'simple', 'misunderstandings', 'production', 'very', 'stagey', 'plot', 'used', 'mainly', 'move', 'characters', 'one', 'set', 'mix', 'up', 'background', 'jokes', 'are', 'told', ""'re"", 'mood', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'have', 'low', 'tolerance', 'cheap', 'wisecracks', 'dumb', 'humor', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'stay', 'away', 'Personally', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'said', 'only', 'picked', 'up', 'discovered', 'selling', 'entire', 'dollar', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'watching', 'many', 'more', 'times.The', 'DVD', 'edition', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'Digiview', 'Productions', 'release', 'picture', 'quality', 'quite', 'bad', 'hard', 'say', 'fault', 'laziness/cheapness', 'DVD', 'company', 'age', 'material', 'Certainly', 'exist', 'other', 'movies', 'era', 'much', 'better', 'condition', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'print', 'simply', 'had', 'harder', 'time', 'others', 'last', 'seventy-five', 'years', 'picture', 'blurry', 'focus', 'spots', 'framing', 'bit', 'too', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'actors', 'heads', 'are', 'cut', 'off', 'sound', 'quality', 'also', 'not', 'stellar', 'being', 'tinny', 'muffled', 'scratchy.That', 'said', 'not', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'where', 'viewer', 'inner', 'film', 'student', 'will', 'be', 'scanning', 'background', 'looking', 'hitherto', 'unseen', 'details', 'just', 'cheaply', 'made', 'quick', 'comedy', 'where', 'poorness', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'really', 'detract', 'much', 'overall', 'experience', 'other', 'hand', 'were', 'few', 'gags', 'rendered', 'nonsensical', 'medium', 'example', 'one', 'point', 'woman', 'con', 'artist', 'walking', 'up', 'flight', 'steps', 'when', 'nowhere', 'smallish', 'explosion', 'presume', 'were', 'supposed', 'see', 'grenade', 'like', 'falling', 'handbag', 'picture', 'quality', 'being', 'so', 'poor', 'just', 'stepped', 'landmine.Another', 'difficult-to-see', 'gag', 'when', 'Wheeler', 'heiress', 'love-interest', 'played', 'Dorothy', 'Lee', 'frequent', 'collaborator', 'W/W', 'haggle', 'how', 'many', 'children', 'should', 'have', 'married', 'life', 'keep', 'punching', 'up', 'numbers', 'old', 'cash', 'register', 'poor', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'audience', 'bewildered', 'what', 'are', 'discussing.The', 'more', 'watch', 'films', 'Wheeler', 'Woolsey', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'ever', 'seriously', 'rivaling', 'affection', 'other', 'comedy', 'stars', 'era', 'have', 'kind', 'innocent', 'charm', 'HOOK', 'LINE', 'AND', 'SINKER', 'pleasant', 'way', 'spending', 'hour']","Hook, Line and Sinker"

Because of the moratorium on musical features which began in the summer of 1930, there is no music in this, save for an orchestra seen on screen during a party sequence, and a brief fanfare over the end title. Even the opening credits have no music, the titles underscored with the sound of a motorcycle and siren. I found myself laughing out loud at many of the funny lines and situations, and there is a great cast of character actors in this.Jobyna Howland, Ralf Harolde, Stanley Fields and especially Natalie Morehead score big laughs.

Wheeler and Woolsey are a very funny comedy team who starred in at least a dozen films in the 1930's, they seemed on the verge of being a real cult act in the 1990's when American Movie Classics ran almost their entire RKO filmography.  Alas, today an old movie on American Movie Classics is one from the 1960's and while Turner Classic Movies owns the rights to the RKO library, they don't show much of W&W  whose humor is a perhaps a little too low rent for TCM's ""classy"" image.  It's a shame because they are genuinely funny, ingenue Dorothy Lee is a doll, and this actually is a good movie so I hate panning this DVD but the print quality is deplorable.  TCM is going to have to air those W&W films eventually because people can only sit through so many showings of the same MGM classics over and over so I would just wait for them to air this if  I were you.",1,Not Worth The Dollar I Paid At Walmart,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,941,"['one', 'very', 'worst', 'prints', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'DVD', 'Wheeler', 'Woolsey', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'comedy', 'team', 'who', 'starred', 'least', 'dozen', 'films', '1930', 'seemed', 'verge', 'being', 'real', 'cult', 'act', '1990', 'when', 'American', 'Movie', 'Classics', 'ran', 'almost', 'entire', 'RKO', 'filmography', 'Alas', 'today', 'old', 'movie', 'American', 'Movie', 'Classics', 'one', '1960', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'rights', 'RKO', 'library', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'much', 'W', 'W', 'humor', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'low', 'rent', 'TCM', 'classy', 'image', 'shame', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'ingenue', 'Dorothy', 'Lee', 'doll', 'actually', 'good', 'movie', 'hate', 'panning', 'DVD', 'print', 'quality', 'deplorable', 'TCM', 'going', 'have', 'air', 'W', 'W', 'films', 'eventually', 'people', 'can', 'only', 'sit', 'so', 'many', 'showings', 'same', 'MGM', 'classics', 'so', 'would', 'just', 'wait', 'air', 'were']","Hook, Line and Sinker"

This is an amusing Wheeler & Woolsey comedy, but the copy is taken from a duped and edited C & C Television print; the original runs 74 minutes and this copy runs 62! To add insult to injury, this is a bad dupe; the climactic shoot-out takes place in a darkened hotel, and here it looks like they're in one of those Warner Brothers cartoon caves where only the eyeballs are visible. Bad sound, bad picture quality, and edited to hell-yuck!
