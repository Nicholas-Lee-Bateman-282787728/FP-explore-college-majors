301490,A2SPVJ5NYCOY00,6302213037,Antoinette Avalon,"[5, 5]","This film is a worthy follow-up to its predecessor ""To Die For"".  Here we find Dracula has moved to a small town in the hills, working as an emergency room doctor on the night shift.  As the story unfolds, we learn that he is sustaining himself on plasma from the hospital while his extended ""family"", including is vicious brother Tom, are wrecking havoc on the natives.  Then Dracula meets Nina, a single mother who has an adopted baby that seems to be plagued with problems.  The infant's marathons of crying repeatedly send his mother to the emergency room trying to find out what's wrong.  Dracula just wants to live in harmony with humans at this point.  As in the first movie, he and his evil sibling end up doing battle over whose way of life is right and who gets the girl.  It's a great modern vampire tale.",4,A Great Sequel,1032480000,"09 20, 2002",2002,816,"['film', 'worthy', 'follow-up', 'predecessor', 'Die', 'Here', 'find', 'Dracula', 'moved', 'small', 'town', 'hills', 'working', 'emergency', 'room', 'doctor', 'night', 'shift', 'story', 'unfolds', 'learn', 'sustaining', 'plasma', 'hospital', 'extended', 'family', 'including', 'vicious', 'brother', 'Tom', 'are', 'wrecking', 'havoc', 'natives', 'Then', 'Dracula', 'meets', 'Nina', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'adopted', 'baby', 'be', 'plagued', 'problems', 'infant', 'marathons', 'crying', 'repeatedly', 'send', 'mother', 'emergency', 'room', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'wrong', 'Dracula', 'just', 'live', 'harmony', 'humans', 'point', 'first', 'movie', 'evil', 'sibling', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'battle', 'way', 'life', 'right', 'who', 'girl', 'great', 'modern', 'vampire', 'tale']",N/A

Didnt buy for the story as much as just to drool over Michael Praed in this. Story needs help and I do like the monster genre thing. A ++ for seller- they did their part.

How do you bring back the four characters that were destroyed in the first movie and put them in a second? You can't. You just hire a talentless screenwriter and hope people forgot about the first movie. This is why Brendan Hughes (from the first movie) quickly passed on this rotten egg. This movie made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Pread is a good actor but he should have passed on this one as his predecessor did. Wyss and Bond are so one-dimensional actors that their acting is laughable. Jay Underwood just makes you want to fall asleep in the first five minutes.,1,A pointless sequel that never should have been made...,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,613,"['put', 'simple', 'word', 'STUPID', 'How', 'do', 'bring', 'back', 'four', 'characters', 'were', 'destroyed', 'first', 'movie', 'put', 'second', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'hire', 'talentless', 'screenwriter', 'hope', 'people', 'forgot', 'first', 'movie', 'why', 'Brendan', 'Hughes', 'first', 'movie', 'quickly', 'passed', 'rotten', 'egg', 'movie', 'made', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'Pread', 'good', 'actor', 'should', 'have', 'passed', 'one', 'predecessor', 'did', 'Wyss', 'Bond', 'are', 'so', 'one-dimensional', 'actors', 'acting', 'laughable', 'Jay', 'Underwood', 'just', 'want', 'fall', 'asleep', 'first', 'five', 'minutes']",N/A

It also contains a little bit of humor. Here we met three vampires, one of them a &quot;nice&quot;  doctor, who the myth of Dracula was born with. His brother Tom is slighty  different. A cold-hearted vampire, with no remorse. I'm not saying that  this is the best buy you can do, but if you like horror-movies, I'm sure  you will find this movie very interesting. It also contains graphic scenes  of gore. Some of the special effects are quite cheesy, but that's not a big  minus.

I've been a fan of Michael's since his Robin Hood days.It's not the best vampire movie out there, but it's pretty good and just watching Michael was enough for me.
