43909,A1MLPBB4JZ07B6,0783116748,"""alabasterwoman""","[25, 29]","This made-for-TV version of the film focuses on Dandridge's musical career (rather than her film career, even though she was first black woman to be nominated for an Oscar), and the racism she had to endure throughout her life.  The acting is very good (especially by Berry and Brent Spiner, who  plays her manager), but the film left too much to supposition and  imagination in some areas.  For example, it never made clear if Otto  Preminger really loved her or not, and why he dumped her so suddenly from  his life; it also never made clear if Mills (her manager) loved her enough  to have a physical relationship with her (or if he only loved her from  afar).  [The scene in which her manager holds her in his arms and sings to  her to calm her down during one of her serious bouts of depression is  especially touching.] The movie also suggests that the Black men who  persued Dandridge were just sex-hungry and had no true affection for her;  And because it's a TV-movie, we don't know if any of this is TRUE...  So  buy the film for the performances (which were very good), not for the story  line (which is rather ragged) or the &quot;historical accuracy&quot; of the  film (which is questionable).",4,"The Acting is Very Good, But....",950659200,"02 16, 2000",2000,1206,"['made-for-TV', 'version', 'film', 'Dandridge', 'musical', 'career', 'rather', 'film', 'career', 'even', 'was', 'first', 'black', 'woman', 'be', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'racism', 'had', 'endure', 'life', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Berry', 'Brent', 'Spiner', 'who', 'manager', 'film', 'left', 'too', 'much', 'supposition', 'imagination', 'areas', 'example', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'really', 'loved', 'not', 'why', 'dumped', 'so', 'suddenly', 'life', 'also', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'Mills', 'manager', 'loved', 'enough', 'have', 'physical', 'relationship', 'only', 'loved', 'afar', '[', 'scene', 'manager', 'arms', 'sings', 'calm', 'down', 'one', 'serious', 'bouts', 'depression', 'especially', 'touching', ']', 'movie', 'also', 'Black', 'men', 'who', 'persued', 'Dandridge', 'were', 'just', 'sex-hungry', 'had', 'true', 'affection', 'TV-movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'TRUE', 'So', 'buy', 'film', 'performances', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'story', 'line', 'rather', 'ragged', 'quot', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'quot', 'film', 'questionable']",N/A

43915,A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST,0783116748,Best Of All,"[5, 5]","All that needs to be stated about Halle Berry's stunning portrayal of Dorothy Dandridge is she won Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and Emmy awards for the HBO drama.In this era where Hollywood is celebrating diversity in movies, we cannot forget the time not that long ago when black performers suffered mightily from closed doors in the front of studios & maybe having a fleeting opportunity through a rear door that was opened just slightly.Dandridge was the first black woman nominated for an Oscar in the Best Actress category for her 1954 performance in Carmen Jones. But Jim Crow pursued her through a tumultuous life that ended with her tragic accidental death or suicide by prescription drugs at the age of 42 in 1965.Perhaps because it was a movie destined for cable, the script powerfully addresses the racism faced by Dandridge in Hollywood and Las Vegas. In one moving scene, a Las Vegas hotel drains and scrubs a pool after Dandridge placed her foot in the water.Berry is magnificent as she balances the triumphs of Dandridge as an actress & nightclub performer with a private life marred by physically-abusive lovers, an alcoholic husband who left her virtually penniless and an ongoing affair with director Otto Preminger, who seemingly showed his real feelings by not attending her funeral.The movie is Berry at a pinnacle artistically and obviously committed to capturing the essence of Dandridge.

As the  first African-American woman to be nominated for an Academy Award, the  first to insist on and receive a star's remuneration, she certainly  warrants the attention of film lovers and scholars.

43936,A2R6RA8FRBS608,0783116748,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[6, 6]","Introducing Dorothy Dandridge tells the story of how Dorothy Dandridge rose to fame despite racism against African Americans in 1950s America. Amazon correctly notes that the film doesn't shy away from the uglier realities that Dandridge had to endure. We see Dorothy having to use a cup to urinate in instead of using the bathroom that was only for whites; and Dorothy watches as people scour the pool at The New Frontier Hotel in Vegas after she merely splashed her foot in the water. We also get insight into how Dorothy was pushed around by Hollywood executives who wanted her to play comparatively small parts like the role of Tuptim in The King and I after starring in Carmen Jones.Halle Berry portrays Dorothy Dandridge with a sensitivity that you can easily appreciate. The victimization Dandridge suffers while living with her mother and her mother's apparent girlfriend is very starkly portrayed without any attempt to water it down; and you find yourself empathizing with her character Dorothy pretty quickly after the movie starts. Halle Berry practically throws herself into the starring role of Dorothy with passion and energy that would make Dorothy proud and grateful if she were still with us today to view this movie. Berry's portrayal of Dorothy's pain and deep angst when she must confront the fact that her only daughter with Harold Nicholas, her first husband, is profoundly brain damaged convinces you that Berry feels everything Dorothy experienced when Dorothy herself had to take the bad news. We see Halle Berry acting convincingly throughout the rest of the picture, too--overjoyed with her love affair with Otto Preminger, crushed when he leaves her twisting in the wind. We see Halle Berry showing us both sides of Dorothy Dandridge--the fiery, brave and amorous side and the vulnerable side of her as well.The supporting cast turns in marvelous performances also. Look for Obba Babatunde to play the role of Harold Nicholas, Dandridge's first husband who cannot be the family man she truly wants him to be although he tries; and Klaus Maria Brandauer is well cast at director Otto Preminger. Brandauer portrays Preminger as a cold, calculating man who wants what he wants when he wants it--and then throws Dandridge's love for him away as soon as he no longer wants it anymore. In addition, Brent Spiner does a great job playing the role of the faithful, loyal manager who tries to guide and protect Dandridge during her tumultuous career and personal ups and downs.The cinematography reflects great judgment; the camera moves at all the right angles to capture the action and mood of every scene. The choreography works well, especially in crowd scenes including Dandridge's first appearance at Ciro's nightclub. In addition, the scenes that display domestic violence reflect a great deal of forethought and good judgment to make the action have just the right effect on the viewer. Excellent!The DVD comes with few extras: I disliked the advertisement ""extra"" which basically just tries to get you to buy more DVDs. The brief biographies of the real life cast members were good but I would have appreciated some commentary by director Martha Coolidge or the cast members.Introducing Dorothy Dandridge does more than merely accomplish the goal of telling us the story of Dorothy's roller coaster career and personal life. This is an insightful portrait of a lady whose life story is full of sad and poignant moments interspersed with professional triumphs and happiness.

43937,A152C8GYY25HAH,0783116748,Matthew Horner,"[6, 7]","While watching ""Introducing Dorothy Dandridge"", I decided that the filmmakers missed the boat by not concentrating more on Dandridge's struggles with racism than on her personal life. I am NOT one of those people who think that all movies about 20th Century black figures must concentrate on this area. In Dandridge's case, however, she really was a pioneer [and perhaps didn't at all like the role? a reluctant warrior?], particularly considering that the peak of her Hollywood career coincided with the Brown vs. the Board of Education decision [1954]. The real tragedy in her life was her being born twenty years too soon.On the other hand, her personal life story does not seem all that unusual - lots of stars have had children with birth defects, have had rotten luck in relationships, have slept with their directors, have had money problems, etc. The `soap opera' approach is often an effective one. It worked really well in ""Me and my Shadow: Life With Judy Garland"". In Dandridge's case, though, it sort of lessens the importance of her life and struggle. The solution, perhaps, would have been to make the movie as a four or six hour miniseries rather than as a regular two hour feature.Halle Berry is quite good as Dandridge, making her at once willful and vulnerable. In a beautiful twist of irony, she plays the first black actress ever to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar in 1954. Dandridge lost. Forty-eight years later, Ms. Berry herself became the first black actress to win the honor.Several scenes struck me as odd. For example, the whole Las Vegas sequence works dramatically to highlight the oppression faced by black stars in the 1950s, but the setup doesn't make sense. Why would anyone have signed a contract with a hotel and then arrived there so unaware of the conditions that existed there? I'm not questioning the prejudices of the time or even the swimming pool incident, but I doubt that the events occurred anywhere close to the way they were portrayed. If nothing else, it makes Dandridge come off as naive as hell and Mills as a very poor manager. I don't know about Mills, but I imagine that Dandridge was one cool, sophisticated lady. There seems as though there was an exception amount of dramatic license taken in telling her story. I wonder why. I suspect her real story was extraordinarily dramatic.",3,Well-intentiond biopic hasn't much depth,1020124800,"04 30, 2002",2002,2344,"['watching', 'Introducing', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'decided', 'filmmakers', 'missed', 'boat', 'not', 'concentrating', 'more', 'Dandridge', 'struggles', 'racism', 'personal', 'life', 'am', 'NOT', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'movies', '20th', 'Century', 'black', 'figures', 'must', 'concentrate', 'area', 'Dandridge', 'case', 'however', 'really', 'was', 'pioneer', '[', 'perhaps', 'did', ""n't"", 'role', 'reluctant', 'warrior', ']', 'particularly', 'considering', 'peak', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'coincided', 'Brown', 'Board', 'Education', 'decision', '[', '1954', ']', 'real', 'tragedy', 'life', 'was', 'being', 'born', 'twenty', 'years', 'too', 'soon.On', 'other', 'hand', 'personal', 'life', 'story', 'not', 'seem', 'unusual', 'lots', 'stars', 'have', 'had', 'children', 'birth', 'defects', 'have', 'had', 'rotten', 'luck', 'relationships', 'have', 'slept', 'directors', 'have', 'had', 'money', 'problems', 'etc', 'soap', 'opera', 'approach', 'often', 'effective', 'one', 'worked', 'really', 'well', 'Me', 'Shadow', 'Life', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Dandridge', 'case', 'sort', 'importance', 'life', 'struggle', 'solution', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'make', 'movie', 'four', 'six', 'hour', 'miniseries', 'rather', 'regular', 'two', 'hour', 'feature.Halle', 'Berry', 'quite', 'good', 'Dandridge', 'making', 'once', 'willful', 'vulnerable', 'beautiful', 'twist', 'irony', 'first', 'black', 'actress', 'ever', 'be', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', '1954', 'Dandridge', 'lost', 'Forty-eight', 'years', 'later', 'Ms.', 'Berry', 'became', 'first', 'black', 'actress', 'win', 'honor.Several', 'scenes', 'struck', 'odd', 'example', 'whole', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'sequence', 'dramatically', 'highlight', 'oppression', 'faced', 'black', 'stars', '1950s', 'setup', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'have', 'signed', 'contract', 'hotel', 'then', 'arrived', 'so', 'unaware', 'conditions', 'existed', ""'m"", 'not', 'questioning', 'prejudices', 'time', 'even', 'swimming', 'pool', 'incident', 'doubt', 'events', 'occurred', 'anywhere', 'close', 'way', 'were', 'portrayed', 'nothing', 'else', 'Dandridge', 'come', 'off', 'as', 'naive', 'hell', 'Mills', 'very', 'poor', 'manager', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'Mills', 'imagine', 'Dandridge', 'was', 'one', 'cool', 'sophisticated', 'lady', 'was', 'exception', 'amount', 'dramatic', 'license', 'taken', 'telling', 'story', 'wonder', 'why', 'suspect', 'real', 'story', 'was', 'extraordinarily', 'dramatic']",N/A

Dandridge's best friend, Gerri Benton, has said this, and so have many other people.  But Berry's resemblance to Dandridge isn't even the half.  Their lives parallel in more ways than one.  Both Berry and Dandridge had to do some extreme things to acquire certain roles (Berry had to literally not bathe for ten days, visit crack houses and talk to drug addicts for her to obtain her role in ""Jungle Fever"" and Dandridge had to come into a movie producer's office dressed as Carmen Jones and show sex appeal in order for him to even consider her...but they both got the roles).  Neither woman had an active father.  Their marriages both failed.  I could go on and on because I have done much research, but it's bizarre how akin these women are.Halle Berry did a magnificent job portraying Dorothy Dandridge.  She captured the most pivotal moments and she did it with such elegance, you would swear it was Dandridge herself.  I was a bit concerned for Berry because I know she had to do some lip-syncing for the stage performances, but that woman pulled it off like it was nothing!  She did very well with the choreography as well.This film has quite a few scenes which are touching and emotional i.e. when certain places didn't want Dandridge to perform because she was a Negro, when her mother's girlfriend stuck her hand in her private area to see if she was still a virgin, when she found out that her only child was retarded, and when she was strung out on pills.  Scenes such as those cause you to realize why she titled her autobiography ""Everything and Nothing.""  Sure, she was the first Negro actress to win an Academy Award for Best Actress (for Carmen Jones), sure, she is one of the most beautiful women to ever walk the earth, sure, she had every man she lusted after, she had a plethora of money, fame, friends, status and intelligence, thus, she had both ""everything and nothing"" simultaneously.

But  it lacked direction and energy, disaccoiating the viewer from any sympathy  or feeling for Dorthy, this in part due to the lackluster performance of  Halle Barry.  I honestly don't know why she won a Golden Globe for her  portrayal.  The musical numbers were glitzy and offered an upbeat tone to  the film.  I am assuming Halle was lip syncing, but she did well with the  music, whatever she was doing, just keep on doing what your doing Halle.  Just don't try and act, because I think she was playing Halle rather than  Dorthy.  I would have actually rather seen Whitney Houston play Dorthy,  but I'm sure Hollywood caved into a pouting Halle Barry.

43958,A3TTC70GZ9SH3S,0783116748,ULTRA,"[1, 1]","First, I just need to say... Halle is beautiful beyond words as usual. I enjoyed watching her performance, very entertaining. My favorite scene from the movie was the 'You do something to me' performance. I'd never heard of this song until the movie came out. Like many, I never even heard of Dorothy Dandridge. Now that I'm much more familiar with her story, and who she is/was, I can say with all honesty that this movie is not an introduction of Dorothy Dandridge at all. The music, the voice-over, and Halle's image is more that of Lena Horne.Being a follower of Halle Berry I was interested in this movie years ago before I ever heard the name Dorothy Dandridge. As a result, after seeing the film I loved it! I sat down, popped the DVD in and asked no questions. Out of curiosity, I researched Dorothy Dandridge, her music, the movies she was in etc. It was one night I went over to a friend of a friend's house who actually loved Dorothy Dandridge, he has am abundance of memorabilia on her. When I walked in one of her movies were playing, and for the very first time I got an eye-full of the real Dorothy! I did not know it was her until he mentioned her name. I squinted my eyes and said 'Is this the lady Halle portrayed?' He said yes. I watched a few scenes and said 'This is nothing like Halle Berry, had you not said anything I would never have known'. The woman on the screen had a very husky vocal, NOTHING like the voice-over done by Wendi William's in the movie. The voices are NOTHING, and I do mean NOTHING alike. Not only that, but her character/personality is much more soulful and/or 'ethnic' than Halle Berry. Dorothy Dandridge sounds closer to an Ella Fitzgerald vocally. Wendi Williams (cross over vocals) is much higher pitched, and dainty like Lena Horne. The entire image of Halle Berry is more fit for a Lena Horne film. Dorothy Dandridge is more like Beyonce from Austin Powers, or Wiloma from Good Times: very 'Black', for lack of better words.I've rummaged through lots of Dorothy Dandridge 'stuff' to figure out if im missing anything, if im 'misinterpreting' anything, and I'm not at all! I remember when this movie first cameout and the media was saying how much Dorothy/Halle resembled, and how Halle is like Dorothy Dandridge brought back to life. I think this was easy to say considering hardly anyone was familiar with who Dorothy Dandridge was, especially people Halle's age or younger. Dorothy Dandridge was forgotten about very long ago, and we know why....but after years of finally being exposed to the REAL Dorothy, I do not see how this movie showcases anything about Dorothy Dandridge, but rather an African American woman who played in films, and sang big band Jazz. This is very generic film, the story has been told over and over again, but what about this movie makes it a Dorothy Dandridge movie? I do not see it at all. Granted, Halle Berry did a fine job of representing a beautiful black woman singing to the enchanting sounds of Big Band, but what about this film showcases anything in particular about Dorothu Dandridge? It's missing so much. Had I not been interested in finding out more about who Dandridge really is I would've just accepted this movie as great! Because I would still be ignorant.Lastly, I want to say, I was actually disappointed after being exposed to the true Dorothy. This movie makes her seem more Glamorous, and Witty than she actually was. This movie is very misleading to younger generations who have not a clue about who, and what Dorothy Dandridge was truly all about. Very disappointed after learning more about her... Couldn't understand how they put this movie together, and noone said what I'm saying right now. Maybe because noone knew, and the internet wasn't big yet? Who knows? But I personally prefer the voice over versions of these songs than the originals. Which is no disrespect at all to Dorothy Dandridge, but what would you expect after comparing the 'real' to a make believe version?",3,"Great movie, but....",1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,3987,"['First', 'just', 'need', 'say', 'Halle', 'beautiful', 'words', 'usual', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'performance', 'very', 'entertaining', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', ""'You"", 'do', 'something', 'performance', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'song', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'many', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'Now', ""'m"", 'much', 'more', 'familiar', 'story', 'who', 'is/was', 'can', 'say', 'honesty', 'movie', 'not', 'introduction', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'music', 'voice-over', 'Halle', 'image', 'more', 'Lena', 'Horne.Being', 'follower', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'was', 'interested', 'movie', 'years', 'ever', 'heard', 'name', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'result', 'seeing', 'film', 'loved', 'sat', 'down', 'popped', 'DVD', 'asked', 'questions', 'curiosity', 'researched', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'music', 'movies', 'was', 'etc', 'was', 'one', 'night', 'went', 'friend', 'friend', 'house', 'who', 'actually', 'loved', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'am', 'abundance', 'memorabilia', 'When', 'walked', 'one', 'movies', 'were', 'playing', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'got', 'eye-full', 'real', 'Dorothy', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'mentioned', 'name', 'squinted', 'eyes', 'said', 'lady', 'Halle', 'portrayed', 'said', 'yes', 'watched', 'few', 'scenes', 'said', 'nothing', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'had', 'not', 'said', 'anything', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'known', 'woman', 'screen', 'had', 'very', 'husky', 'vocal', 'NOTHING', 'voice-over', 'done', 'Wendi', 'William', 'movie', 'voices', 'are', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'mean', 'NOTHING', 'alike', 'Not', 'only', 'character/personality', 'much', 'more', 'soulful', 'and/or', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'closer', 'Ella', 'Fitzgerald', 'vocally', 'Wendi', 'Williams', 'cross', 'vocals', 'much', 'higher', 'pitched', 'dainty', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'entire', 'image', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'more', 'fit', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'film', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'more', 'like', 'Beyonce', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'Wiloma', 'Good', 'Times', 'very', ""'Black"", 'lack', 'better', 'words.I', ""'ve"", 'rummaged', 'lots', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', ""'stuff"", 'figure', 'out', 'im', 'missing', 'anything', 'im', ""'misinterpreting"", 'anything', ""'m"", 'not', 'remember', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'cameout', 'media', 'was', 'saying', 'how', 'much', 'Dorothy/Halle', 'resembled', 'how', 'Halle', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'think', 'was', 'easy', 'say', 'considering', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'was', 'familiar', 'who', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'was', 'especially', 'people', 'Halle', 'age', 'younger', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'was', 'forgotten', 'very', 'long', 'ago', 'know', 'why', '.but', 'years', 'finally', 'being', 'exposed', 'REAL', 'Dorothy', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'anything', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'rather', 'African', 'American', 'woman', 'who', 'played', 'films', 'sang', 'big', 'band', 'Jazz', 'very', 'generic', 'film', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'over', 'again', 'what', 'movie', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'Granted', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'representing', 'beautiful', 'black', 'woman', 'singing', 'enchanting', 'sounds', 'Big', 'Band', 'what', 'film', 'anything', 'particular', 'Dorothu', 'Dandridge', 'missing', 'so', 'much', 'Had', 'not', 'been', 'interested', 'finding', 'out', 'more', 'who', 'Dandridge', 'really', 'would', ""'ve"", 'just', 'accepted', 'movie', 'great', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'ignorant.Lastly', 'want', 'say', 'was', 'actually', 'disappointed', 'being', 'exposed', 'true', 'Dorothy', 'movie', 'seem', 'more', 'Glamorous', 'Witty', 'actually', 'was', 'movie', 'very', 'misleading', 'younger', 'generations', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'clue', 'who', 'what', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'was', 'truly', 'Very', 'disappointed', 'learning', 'more', 'Could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'put', 'movie', 'together', 'noone', 'said', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'right', 'now', 'Maybe', 'noone', 'knew', 'internet', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'yet', 'Who', 'personally', 'prefer', 'voice', 'versions', 'songs', 'originals', 'Which', 'disrespect', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'comparing', ""'real"", 'make', 'believe', 'version']",N/A
43959,A1QRZM0ECTLUIY,0783116748,WC,"[0, 0]","Released to dvd in 2000 Introducing Dorothy Dandridge is a film that rarely gets made especially when the subject is an african-american female in the 1950's. Dorothy Dandridge was a beautifully talented actress and singer although never fully taken seriously or given the due that she truely deserved. Dorothy's entire being dripped with glamour, sex appeal and charisma  nothing short of bombshell at a time when Hollywood pin-ups were supposed to be white. Frankly the film industry hadnt the slightest idea what to do with her, her nightclub act was polished and deffinately before its time the south was not ready for such a gem as a black performer she wasn't allowed to stay in many of the hotels or even use the pools, in fact one incident highlights this very fact depicting the janitors of a hotel cleaning a pool in which dorothy had swam in. This film truly depicts the Dandridge that is remembered, Dorothy at her highest heights but also gives us a glimpse of her lowest of lows, dealing with racism, sexism and attempting to become an actress that all will know for all time. The fabulous Halle Berry slips on Ms. Dandridges shoes and truly becomes the iconic actress. The dvd features actor bios but that is it, although it would be nice to have much more honoring this beautiful history making actress it is great to just be able to own it. Dorothy Dandridge became the 1st African-American woman to be honored with  an Academy award nomination as Best Actress for her knockout performance in 1954's Otto Preminger directed,Carmen Jones although she lost the award to Grace Kelly Carmen Jones is Dandridges most well known and beloved film. Although Ms Dandridge died of an overdose of pills in 1965 her legacy shall not be forgotten and this film shows why it cant be forgotten. Dorothy is truly unsung and hopefully this film will shine a light to her struggles and educate those of this beautiful songbirds potential and the achievements that many have yet to learn.With a stunning supporting cast Loretta Devine,Brent Spiner, Obba Babatunde, and Klaus Maria Brandauer, Introducing Dorothy Dandridge is fabulous and lets the true story of a woman many don't know shine through.This is deffinately a film the whole family should see.",5,Introducing the Fabulous Dorothy Dandridge,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,2252,"['Released', 'dvd', '2000', 'Introducing', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'film', 'rarely', 'made', 'especially', 'when', 'subject', 'african-american', 'female', '1950', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'was', 'beautifully', 'talented', 'actress', 'singer', 'never', 'fully', 'taken', 'seriously', 'given', 'due', 'truely', 'deserved', 'Dorothy', 'entire', 'being', 'dripped', 'glamour', 'sex', 'appeal', 'charisma', 'nothing', 'short', 'bombshell', 'time', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'pin-ups', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'white', 'Frankly', 'film', 'industry', 'hadnt', 'slightest', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'nightclub', 'act', 'was', 'polished', 'deffinately', 'time', 'south', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'such', 'gem', 'black', 'performer', 'was', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'stay', 'many', 'hotels', 'even', 'use', 'pools', 'fact', 'one', 'incident', 'highlights', 'very', 'fact', 'depicting', 'janitors', 'hotel', 'cleaning', 'pool', 'dorothy', 'had', 'swam', 'film', 'truly', 'Dandridge', 'remembered', 'Dorothy', 'highest', 'heights', 'also', 'glimpse', 'lowest', 'lows', 'dealing', 'racism', 'sexism', 'attempting', 'become', 'actress', 'will', 'know', 'time', 'fabulous', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Ms.', 'Dandridges', 'shoes', 'truly', 'iconic', 'actress', 'dvd', 'actor', 'bios', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'honoring', 'beautiful', 'history', 'making', 'actress', 'great', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'own', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'became', '1st', 'African-American', 'woman', 'be', 'honored', 'Academy', 'award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'knockout', 'performance', '1954', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'directed', 'Carmen', 'Jones', 'lost', 'award', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Carmen', 'Jones', 'Dandridges', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'beloved', 'film', 'Ms', 'Dandridge', 'died', 'overdose', 'pills', '1965', 'legacy', 'shall', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'film', 'why', 'cant', 'be', 'forgotten', 'Dorothy', 'truly', 'unsung', 'hopefully', 'film', 'will', 'shine', 'light', 'struggles', 'educate', 'beautiful', 'songbirds', 'potential', 'achievements', 'many', 'have', 'yet', 'learn.With', 'stunning', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'Brent', 'Spiner', 'Obba', 'Babatunde', 'Klaus', 'Maria', 'Brandauer', 'Introducing', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'fabulous', 'true', 'story', 'woman', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'shine', 'through.This', 'deffinately', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'should', 'see']",N/A
