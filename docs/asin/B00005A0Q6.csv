She is called to serve on Jury Duty and eagerly accepts. She does this for she feels that it is her right to make sure justice is served.The real suspense starts when her excitement turns into suspicion, then fear, as she discovers the truth about the case.

This movie reminds me of the typical ""B"" movies on tv when I was growing up in the 70's, late 60's... something that might play on a Saturday afternoon.Nolte has a pretty small role in this - few lines. So if you might want to watch this because of Nolte you'll be disappointed. (And to be honest, his face on the cover of the movie is what made me consider watching it. I expected he'd have a bit more of a role in this.)  He is the man on trial for the murder of his wife - Leachman is a woman on the jury and the movie really revolves around Leachman and her husband.I like Leachman's character, but the story had her wondering if her husband could be the real killer at the first clue - which was too small and unlikely a clue to have even given her a second thought when (as far as we know) she had no reason to doubt her marriage was anything other than perfect and her husband anything other than faithful and devoted.  The second clue might have given her a niggling doubt in the back of her mind......had the writers brought up their earlier time apart much sooner in the movie it would've made better sense.I didn't hate it, it was okay for a ""B"" movie.=======================TECHNICAL NOTE:While the sound of this instant video is audible, it's soft so I had to have all speakers turned up full blast and then keep quiet (no eating or fidgeting) to hear this, and sometimes the sound was crackly..",3,"a ""B"" movie starring Leachman - Nolte only has a small role",1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,1514,"['label', 'Cinema', 'Classics', 'be', 'stretch', 'not', 'Classic', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'reason', 'movie', 'typical', 'B', 'movies', 'tv', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', '70', 'late', '60', 'something', 'might', 'play', 'Saturday', 'afternoon.Nolte', 'pretty', 'small', 'role', 'few', 'lines', 'So', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'Nolte', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'be', 'honest', 'face', 'cover', 'movie', 'what', 'made', 'consider', 'watching', 'expected', ""'d"", 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'role', 'man', 'trial', 'murder', 'wife', 'Leachman', 'woman', 'jury', 'movie', 'really', 'Leachman', 'husband.I', 'Leachman', 'character', 'story', 'had', 'wondering', 'husband', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'killer', 'first', 'clue', 'was', 'too', 'small', 'unlikely', 'clue', 'have', 'even', 'given', 'second', 'thought', 'when', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'had', 'reason', 'doubt', 'marriage', 'was', 'anything', 'other', 'perfect', 'husband', 'anything', 'other', 'faithful', 'devoted', 'second', 'clue', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'niggling', 'doubt', 'back', 'mind', 'had', 'writers', 'brought', 'up', 'earlier', 'time', 'apart', 'much', 'sooner', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'better', 'sense.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'was', 'okay', 'B', 'movie.=======================TECHNICAL', 'NOTE', 'sound', 'instant', 'video', 'audible', 'soft', 'so', 'had', 'have', 'speakers', 'turned', 'up', 'full', 'blast', 'then', 'keep', 'quiet', 'eating', 'fidgeting', 'hear', 'sometimes', 'sound', 'was', 'crackly..']",N/A
