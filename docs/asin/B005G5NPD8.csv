1459905,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B005G5NPD8,Andre Dursin,"[1, 1]","In the late `70s, Marvel super-heroes hit the small screen in a series of TV movies that met with varying degrees of success - though mostly favoring the underwhelming side. The success of ""The Incredible Hulk"" wasn't matched by CBS' ""Amazing Spider-Man"" series with Nicholas Hammond (though I'm still waiting for a soundtrack of Johnnie Spence's music from the first two-hour movie) or the forgettable, one-time sojourn of ""Dr. Strange.""Universal and CBS also tried, twice, to make a series out of ""Captain America,"" re-christening Steve Rogers as an easy-going California guy who drives a van and hangs out by the beach. Lana Wood co-starred with Brown in the first movie (Brown actually plays Rogers' son, unaware of his father's earlier exploits as the original Cap) with Christopher Lee hamming it up in the sequel, ""Captain America II: Death Too Soon,"" which brought Connie Selleca onboard as the love interest.Neither project worked well enough to bring the show to series, though Mike Post's scores are quite appealing in a late `70s, tuneful melodic manner, and each movie should still be of interest for nostalgia freaks and hardcore comic book fans old enough to remember them (younger viewers accustomed to the new Marvel movie are sure to be bored silly, however!).Even if the tele-films feel more like ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" than a true rendition of the comic book (in the same way that ""The Incredible Hulk"" felt ""inspired"" by ""The Fugitive""), Shout's DVD set - coupling both on a single dual layer disc - should prove satisfying for interested viewers. The full-screen transfers and soundtracks are all just fine and the sub-$15 price (in most outlets) is perfectly acceptable.",4,"Dated, Yet Entertaining, '70s TV Movie Fun",1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,1699,"['late', '70s', 'Marvel', 'super-heroes', 'hit', 'small', 'screen', 'series', 'TV', 'movies', 'met', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'mostly', 'favoring', 'underwhelming', 'side', 'success', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'was', ""n't"", 'matched', 'CBS', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'series', 'Nicholas', 'Hammond', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'soundtrack', 'Johnnie', 'Spence', 'music', 'first', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'forgettable', 'one-time', 'sojourn', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'Universal', 'CBS', 'also', 'tried', 'twice', 'make', 'series', 'Captain', 'America', 're-christening', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'easy-going', 'California', 'guy', 'who', 'van', 'hangs', 'out', 'beach', 'Lana', 'Wood', 'co-starred', 'Brown', 'first', 'movie', 'Brown', 'actually', 'Rogers', 'son', 'unaware', 'father', 'earlier', 'exploits', 'original', 'Cap', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'hamming', 'up', 'sequel', 'Captain', 'America', 'II', 'Death', 'Too', 'Soon', 'brought', 'Connie', 'Selleca', 'onboard', 'love', 'interest.Neither', 'project', 'worked', 'well', 'enough', 'bring', 'show', 'series', 'Mike', 'Post', 'scores', 'are', 'quite', 'appealing', 'late', '70s', 'tuneful', 'melodic', 'manner', 'movie', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'interest', 'nostalgia', 'freaks', 'hardcore', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'younger', 'viewers', 'accustomed', 'new', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'are', 'sure', 'be', 'bored', 'silly', 'however', '.Even', 'tele-films', 'feel', 'more', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'true', 'rendition', 'comic', 'book', 'same', 'way', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'felt', 'inspired', 'Fugitive', 'Shout', 'DVD', 'set', 'coupling', 'single', 'dual', 'layer', 'disc', 'should', 'prove', 'satisfying', 'interested', 'viewers', 'full-screen', 'transfers', 'soundtracks', 'are', 'just', 'fine', 'sub-', '15', 'price', 'most', 'outlets', 'perfectly', 'acceptable']",Captain America / Captain America II: Death Too Soon

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[23, 36]","Of all the major superheroes, Captain America has been the unluckiest -- it took SEVENTY YEARS for a decent movie about him to be made.So what were the NON-decent movies that were made along the way? ""Captain America / Captain America II: Death Too Soon"" is a pretty good example -- not only does it throw out all the original comic book backstory, but it ends up being cheesy, action-deficient and boring. Way too boring to be campy.In ""Captain America,"" ex-Marine Steve Rogers (Reb Brown) is toodling around California in his nondescript van, not really doing anything. But then an old friend is murdered, and for some reason the bad guys also decide to attack Steve because they think he knows the location of secret classified film.The only way to save his life is to inject him with FLAG, an experimental super-drug that Steve's father created so he could become a superhero.  This is the point where all Captain America fans go cross-eyed.  So after being bribed with superhero gear (like a rocket-powered motorcycle) Steve reluctantly becomes Captain America, and helps hunt down the evil men who are planning to nuke an American city.Then in ""Captain America II: Death Too Soon,"" Steve is sent out to investigate a missing scientist who had some kind of aging compound stolen by famous terrorist Miguel (Christopher Lee). It leads him to a small town that immediately tries to get him to get lost, apparently because they were told to act as suspiciously as possible.""Captain America"" and ""Captain America II: Death Too Soon"" are, hands down, the dullest superhero movies I have ever seen in my life. Not only do they toss out EVERYTHING about Captain America (except the silly costume and the name), but they instead produce two generic thrillers that have plot holes the size of Steve's van.For one thing, there's almost no action. Captain America spends more time running away from bad guys than actually fighting them, meaning that the ENTIRE FIRST MOVIE has only one fight scene (which mainly involves Steve pushing slabs of meat at the bad guys). The second movie is substantially better, but most of both movies seem to consist of... talking and driving.NOTE TO FILMMAKERS: long lingering shots of OTHER people riding motorcycles are simply not interesting.And the acting is not much better. Lead actor Reb Brown looks like he's been drugged much of the time, when his character isn't whining about how he just wants to be a wandering artist. Most of the other characters are so underdeveloped and nondescript that it's hard to remember them; the one exception is Christopher Lee, who seems vaguely annoyed all the time.The 1970s were not kind to Captain America, and ""Captain America/Captain America II: Death Too Soon"" end up being too dull to be campy fun.",1,Captain zzzzzzz....,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,2774,"['major', 'superheroes', 'Captain', 'America', 'been', 'unluckiest', 'took', 'SEVENTY', 'YEARS', 'decent', 'movie', 'be', 'made.So', 'were', 'NON-decent', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'way', 'Captain', 'America', '/', 'Captain', 'America', 'II', 'Death', 'Too', 'Soon', 'pretty', 'good', 'example', 'not', 'only', 'throw', 'out', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'backstory', 'up', 'being', 'cheesy', 'action-deficient', 'boring', 'Way', 'too', 'boring', 'be', 'campy.In', 'Captain', 'America', 'ex-Marine', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'toodling', 'around', 'California', 'nondescript', 'van', 'not', 'really', 'doing', 'anything', 'then', 'old', 'friend', 'murdered', 'reason', 'bad', 'guys', 'also', 'decide', 'attack', 'Steve', 'think', 'location', 'secret', 'classified', 'film.The', 'only', 'way', 'save', 'life', 'inject', 'FLAG', 'experimental', 'super-drug', 'Steve', 'father', 'created', 'so', 'could', 'become', 'superhero', 'point', 'where', 'Captain', 'America', 'fans', 'go', 'cross-eyed', 'So', 'being', 'bribed', 'superhero', 'gear', 'rocket-powered', 'motorcycle', 'Steve', 'reluctantly', 'Captain', 'America', 'hunt', 'down', 'evil', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'nuke', 'American', 'city.Then', 'Captain', 'America', 'II', 'Death', 'Too', 'Soon', 'Steve', 'sent', 'out', 'investigate', 'missing', 'scientist', 'who', 'had', 'kind', 'aging', 'compound', 'stolen', 'famous', 'terrorist', 'Miguel', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'small', 'town', 'immediately', 'get', 'get', 'lost', 'apparently', 'were', 'told', 'act', 'as', 'suspiciously', 'possible', 'Captain', 'America', 'Captain', 'America', 'II', 'Death', 'Too', 'Soon', 'are', 'hands', 'down', 'dullest', 'superhero', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'toss', 'out', 'EVERYTHING', 'Captain', 'America', 'silly', 'costume', 'name', 'instead', 'produce', 'two', 'generic', 'thrillers', 'have', 'plot', 'holes', 'size', 'Steve', 'van.For', 'one', 'thing', 'almost', 'action', 'Captain', 'America', 'more', 'time', 'running', 'away', 'bad', 'guys', 'actually', 'fighting', 'meaning', 'ENTIRE', 'FIRST', 'MOVIE', 'only', 'one', 'fight', 'scene', 'mainly', 'Steve', 'pushing', 'slabs', 'meat', 'bad', 'guys', 'second', 'movie', 'substantially', 'better', 'most', 'movies', 'seem', 'consist', 'talking', 'driving.NOTE', 'TO', 'FILMMAKERS', 'long', 'lingering', 'shots', 'OTHER', 'people', 'riding', 'motorcycles', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'interesting.And', 'acting', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'Lead', 'actor', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'been', 'drugged', 'much', 'time', 'when', 'character', ""n't"", 'whining', 'how', 'just', 'be', 'wandering', 'artist', 'Most', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'underdeveloped', 'nondescript', 'hard', 'remember', 'one', 'exception', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'who', 'vaguely', 'annoyed', 'time.The', '1970s', 'were', 'not', 'kind', 'Captain', 'America', 'Captain', 'America/Captain', 'America', 'II', 'Death', 'Too', 'Soon', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'too', 'dull', 'be', 'campy', 'fun']",Captain America / Captain America II: Death Too Soon
1459914,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B005G5NPD8,Einsatz,"[1, 3]","Well, it's certainly cheap enough.  In every sense of the word.  And you do get two movies for an incredibly low price.  Whether or not they are worth even that is cause for debate.At worst, these two movies are very basic, low impact fare.  In the first feature we learn that the star of this yawn (I meant yarn) is not really Captain America, his father held that distinction.  So this set should really be titled Captain America Jr.  And Junior would rather paint than fight dastardly villains.  Junior is played with stupefying numbness by Reb Brown (a pleasant but personality-free..........I hesitate to say......actor).  The plot involves sinister doings by oil company bad guy Lou Brackett (Steve Forrest).  He's got a neutron bomb and he's not afraid to use it in a gold heist.  To circumvent any possible interference by the reluctant hero, bad guy Lou makes several attempts on Junior's life, finally succeeding, allowing Dr. Simon Mills (Len Birman) to inject the dying do-gooder with a super-steroid that saves his life and makes him super-duper strong.  Thus creating............da ta.............CAPTAIN AMERICA junior.  He's given a snazzy motor bike and made to wear what looks like Evel Knievel's long underwear (black would have been more slimming!).  The plot also involves a dead wife and dubious CPR.  By the end of the first movie he's given a new outfit........but he still looks like Wonder Woman.As for the second installment, it's still Reb and Reb still can't act, he's still doodling all over the place when not battling your garden variety 70's thugs.  The bad guy moved up in quality with the hiring of that old bloodsucker Christopher Lee (taking home an easy paycheck for doing precious little).  Some aging serum is involved (everyone gets old watching this one!).  There's even a dam chase scene...........involving a dam.  There's also a veterinarian who only sees people patients, a case of home wrecking (literally), and an old lamb.  The second feature is marginally better than the first, but that's not saying much.I couldn't possibly be made to watch either ever again, never.  Even under pain of death.

1459917,AZB4CQ9JZSUQB,B005G5NPD8,Eric Pregosin,"[3, 4]","Back in the late 70s, Superheroes were all over TV.  In addition to Batman, Superman and Lone Ranger reruns from the 50s and 60s, in first run we had Wonder Woman (lasted 3 years), The Incredible Hulk (lasted 4), Spiderman (last 1 month, then came back sporadically the following year) and then there was Captain America. Reb Brown, remembered primarily for a SciFi bomb ""Yor, Hunter of The Future"" and a bit part in ""SSSSSSS"" was cast as a modern (1979) Steve Rogers who just got out of the marines, and was looking forward to some relaxation.  On getting 2 telegrams, one from a government scientist who knew his dad, and the other from a friend in trouble, Steve finds himself being attacked out of nowhere by the bad guys responsible for eventually killing his buddy, and eventually they run him off the road and leave him for dead.  To save Steve's life, the fore mentioned scientist and his aide inject him with a serum which his father had developed and increased his strength and agility.  The results are, he has the power now to take care of these baddies and learn why they killed his buddy (they wanted his plans for developing a neutron bomb, which they eventually develop and intend to use to blow up a vault at a gold depository). Thus is born Steve's new identity, Captain America, who goes after the bad guys, on a super fast motor bike, a boomerang type shield that can deflect bullets, and his new powers all disguised in a red, white and blue costume. That's in the first film.  In the second, an international terrorist posing a penitentiary warden kidnaps a scientist who had once developed an rapid aging formula and attempts to use it to age the world while he remains young. It's up to Captain America, to save the town our new baddie tests the formula on, and get it away from him before he ages the world.  In addition to Brown, cast in this rarely seen (except maybe on Syfy then SciFi Channel) since its original run doubleheader are, Len Birman as Simon Mills, the scientist who gives Steve his new powers, Heather Menzies (in the first film) and Connie Selleca (pre Tesh) as Wendy Day, his partner, Steve Forrest (fresh from S.W.A.T.) as Lou Brackett the bad guy in the first film, and Christopher Lee as Miguel, the baddie in the second.  Like the other shows of their time, these are pretty much comic book, although the stories are not FROM the comic, but still are nice G rated entertainment.  Technically I admit they look like they did back then, and the second film does not have the flashbacks from the first in the opening credit sequence originally but at least the majority of the storyline in both cases is there without cuts or commercials.  2 hokey movies, that were hard to get in the VHS day at a nice price.",5,Captain America (the 1979 interpretation),1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,2755,"['Back', 'late', '70s', 'Superheroes', 'were', 'TV', 'addition', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Lone', 'Ranger', '50s', '60s', 'first', 'run', 'had', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'lasted', '3', 'years', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'lasted', '4', 'Spiderman', 'last', '1', 'month', 'then', 'came', 'back', 'sporadically', 'following', 'year', 'then', 'was', 'Captain', 'America', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'remembered', 'primarily', 'SciFi', 'bomb', 'Yor', 'Hunter', 'Future', 'bit', 'part', 'SSSSSSS', 'was', 'cast', 'modern', '1979', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'marines', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'relaxation', 'getting', '2', 'telegrams', 'one', 'government', 'scientist', 'who', 'knew', 'dad', 'other', 'friend', 'trouble', 'Steve', 'being', 'attacked', 'nowhere', 'bad', 'guys', 'responsible', 'eventually', 'killing', 'buddy', 'eventually', 'run', 'off', 'road', 'leave', 'dead', 'save', 'Steve', 'life', 'fore', 'mentioned', 'scientist', 'aide', 'inject', 'serum', 'father', 'had', 'developed', 'increased', 'strength', 'agility', 'results', 'are', 'power', 'now', 'take', 'care', 'baddies', 'learn', 'why', 'killed', 'buddy', 'wanted', 'plans', 'developing', 'neutron', 'bomb', 'eventually', 'develop', 'intend', 'use', 'blow', 'up', 'vault', 'gold', 'depository', 'Thus', 'born', 'Steve', 'new', 'identity', 'Captain', 'America', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'super', 'fast', 'motor', 'bike', 'boomerang', 'type', 'shield', 'can', 'deflect', 'bullets', 'new', 'powers', 'disguised', 'red', 'white', 'blue', 'costume', 'first', 'film', 'second', 'international', 'terrorist', 'posing', 'penitentiary', 'warden', 'scientist', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'developed', 'rapid', 'aging', 'formula', 'attempts', 'use', 'age', 'world', 'young', 'up', 'Captain', 'America', 'save', 'town', 'new', 'baddie', 'formula', 'get', 'away', 'world', 'addition', 'Brown', 'cast', 'rarely', 'seen', 'maybe', 'Syfy', 'then', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'original', 'run', 'doubleheader', 'are', 'Len', 'Birman', 'Simon', 'Mills', 'scientist', 'who', 'Steve', 'new', 'powers', 'Heather', 'Menzies', 'first', 'film', 'Connie', 'Selleca', 'pre', 'Tesh', 'Wendy', 'Day', 'partner', 'Steve', 'Forrest', 'fresh', 'S.W.A.T', 'Lou', 'Brackett', 'bad', 'guy', 'first', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Miguel', 'baddie', 'second', 'other', 'shows', 'time', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'comic', 'book', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'comic', 'still', 'are', 'nice', 'G', 'rated', 'entertainment', 'Technically', 'admit', 'look', 'did', 'back', 'then', 'second', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'flashbacks', 'first', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence', 'originally', 'least', 'majority', 'storyline', 'cases', 'there', 'cuts', 'commercials', '2', 'hokey', 'movies', 'were', 'hard', 'get', 'VHS', 'day', 'nice', 'price']",Captain America / Captain America II: Death Too Soon

1459920,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005G5NPD8,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[2, 2]","I remember the Reb Brown Captain America TV films from when I was a youngster, and I remember them with the same fondness that I do shows like the Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno INCREDIBLE HULK and the Nicholas Hammond AMAZING SPIDER-MAN series. These were fun because getting to see some of your favorite characters in real life, but they were also alternately frustrating because they had little or nothing to do with the actual peripheral characters. You weren't going to ever see The Hulk fight Abomination or The Leader; You were never going to see Spider-Man fight The Green Goblin or Doc Ock, and with these two films, you weren't going to see Cap fighting HYDRA or The Red Skull. They fought terrorists and crooks and racketeers, but never an actual comic book villain (although to be fair, Hulk did once team up with Daredevil to fight The Kingpin and he also teamed up with Thor:Incredible Hulk Returns/The Trial of the Incredible Hulk).Even more frustrating about this collection is that almost everything you know about Steve Rogers is wrong here... except for really small details. Here, Reb Brown, who plays our hero, is already handsome and extra-muscular. He's just left The Marines and intends to just travel ""Nomad""-ically around this beautiful country with his artistic skills to try and find his place in the world in his conversion van and his motorcycle. He ends up being contacted by Dr. Simon Mills (played with a lot of sincerity by Len Birman), who is a scientist and doctor who is the head of several different projects and answers only to The President. He also worked with Steve's father, who apparently developed a serum called FLAG (Full Latent Ability Gain) which is supposed to make someone stronger, bigger, faster and better by allowing them to access their all of their brain and body abilities. The catch is that it only seems to work on those with Rogers' genetic code. Naturally, Steve gets himself embroiled in a conspiracy to construct a neutron bomb and ends up getting so badly hurt, he will only live if injected with the FLAG serum. At one point, Mills tells Steve that his father fought for the country and The President, and his enemies slapped him with the moniker of ""Captain America"", and that Steve should embrace this name, rather than scoff at it.He's given a new van; one that actually hides a new jet-powered motorcycle in the back, and he's given a shield made of a transparent compound that has the red stripes and the blue and white star, and it's throwable and it's bullet-proof. Eventually, he gets a Evel Knievel-esque motorcycle suit, a motorcycle helmet with wings and a big ""A"" stenciled on it, and he goes into action as CAPTAIN AMERICA!!The really interesting thing I noticed while watching it again was actually how certain really obscure details about Cap were presented in the film: Steve Rogers did spend a good amount of years in the 70's and 80's in the comic book working on art commissions out of his van, which was also his mobile headquarters... where his motorcycle was also secretly hidden!!As far as technical specs, it's a standard TV ratio of 1:33:1, so while it may look pretty good on your flat-screen, it certainly won't take up the whole screen. You can choose between the first film or the second film, but there are no other special features and not even a chapter select feature. It's press Play and Pause and Stop... and that's all there is.If you're a fan of the big-screen CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER mainly because it adheres so closely to his actual origins and abilities and would hate anything that deviates from the source material; well, frankly... you're going to hate these films, because these are pretty far out there from the source material.

It was around the time the Marvel had made deals with CBS to bring Characters like Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, and Doctor Strange to TV. You would think that they were going to be as well written and produced as the Hulk was, but alas, Captain America was not.The story was set in the late 1970's instead and used the idea that Steve Rogers had just gotten out of the Marines and was called in by a scientist that had worked with Steve's Father on a Steroid called F.L.A.G (Full Latent Ability Gain). The Steroid worked to increase the stregth of the person or animal ifused with it, but killed them in the end. The only one that could take it was Steve, because it was from his Father. His Father apparently was the 1st Captain America.Ok, This verges off from what the actual origon of the cahracter is. We don't even get a good looking sheild in this. It's a Bulletproof Glass that looks terrible. He can throw it like a boomarang, but it looks really fake. The only cool part was the bike he rode. The story is fractured. The villian in the 1st film know that if Steve gets the FLAG steoid, that he would be able to do things that only a perfect human could do. How did the villian find out about FLAG? We don't even get a suit that resembles the comic suit until the tale end of the first one. It looks really poor.

The two 1970's made for tv ""Captain America"" movies for CBS (and I put those in quotes for a reason), were really just the producers' excuse to cash in on ""The Six Million Dollar Man!""As you might have read by the other reviews, these two ""Cap"" movies bore little resemblance to the Joe Simon/Jack Kirby comic of the 1940's, or even to the Stan Lee/Jack Kirby revival of the 1960's.There's no Bucky Barnes, no Professor Erskine or Reinstein, no Red Skull, no Nazis, no Peggy or Sharon Carter, no SHIELD, Nick Fury, etc., etc., etc.As for Steve Rogers, this version of him isn't so eager to serve his country after being rejected as 4-F (though, to be fair, in this version, he is an ex-marine.)What you will get is Len Birman as ""Dr. Simon Mills"" who's keeping ""the original Captain America's"" super steroid and injecting it into reluctant ""Steve Rogers"" (Reb Brown) after a fatal accident (well, attempted murder made to look like an accident) in order to save his life.  Afterward, Mr. Rogers becomes a secret agent directly under Dr. Mills.These two exhibit a father-son/older brother-younger brother type of relationship suspiciously similar to Richard Anderson's ""Oscar Goldman"" and Lee Major's ""Steve Austin.""While ""Steve Rogers"" is on the operating table, there's even a shot of the doctors and their patient that's extremely similar to the opening credits to ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" (with those over head lights!) and after the injections, ""Steve"" even muses how, with his new found strength, if he holds something too tight, it will break (Lee Majors says the exact same dialogue, practically line for line, in the ""Six Million Dollar Man"" pilot episode ""Cyborg."")Most telling is the sound effects.  Whenever Reb Brown does something ""super"", we hear that electronic sound of his muscles that sounds just like when Lee Majors jumps, runs, or bends steel!Perhaps the tv execs were thinking along the same ""follow what's selling"" formulaic lines that Kenneth Johnson thought when he ""developed"" ""The Incredible Hulk"" for CBS (he wasn't behind ""Captain America"", but he did make ""Dr. Banner"" and ""The Hulk"" more like the 1960's tv portrayal of ""The Fugitive""...even renaming ""Bruce Banner"" as ""David"", like the actor who portrayed ""Dr. Richard Kimble"", David Janssen.)The show is worth getting...if you grew up in the 1970's, and you want the two movies for purely nostalgic purposes.

The movies starred Reb Brown as Steve Rogers/Captain America and Len Birman as Dr. Simon Mills.I grew up watching these films when they first aired on television in the late '70's.  I had a great time watching them then and I had a great time watching them again this past week after I purchased this DVD.Are the films perfect?  No, not at all.  But if you watch the films for what they're intended to be, notably a fun campy romp a la the 60's Batman series, I think you'll enjoy them more than if you watch them in a serious manner.I was also pleased to see that the films are included in their entirety.  They're not chopped up like they were when Syfy broadcast them last summer before Captain America:  The First Avenger premiered in theaters.On to the review of the disc itself.  Equipment used to watch this DVD was a Sony HDTV, Sony 3D Blu-Ray Player and Sony 6.1 home theater surround sound.I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the presentation.  The films looked pretty good for material that was shot for television over 30 years ago.  I did find myself wishing that some extra work could have been done to make them even more colorful.The sound left a lot to be desired in my opinion.  I wish the audio on these two movies could have been released in better fidelity (5.1 sound, as they were broadcast on Syfy last summer).  As it is, the films are presented in a 2.0 soundtrack which I think is ok but it's nothing special.When you take into consideration the amount of dubbed in sounds such as Captain America's motorcycle, explosions & gunfire, etc. it would have enhanced the viewing experience significantly had more work been done for this DVD.  It's too bad that Shout! didn't deem the extra effort as being necessary.I am docking this release 1 star because this disc is just a bare-bones release.  I feel that Shout! really dropped the ball with this by not including any interviews with Reb Brown or any other stars who were in these films.  If they could include cast interviews for their Street Hawk release, they surely could have done so with this release too.  As it is, all you get are the two films and that's it.If you enjoyed seeing these films growing up in the '70's, then yes I would add this to your collection.
