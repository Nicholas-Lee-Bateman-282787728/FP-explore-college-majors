The movie is not a new approach to spy films, but a reminder of how laborious a spy film can be. Looking heavily sedated at times, Cusack plays the role of another ""last run"" spy operative . The whole ""numbers"" factor was a bit confusing and although interesting, a poor narritive for this venture. There is a  heavy handededness to the storyline as it recycles one boring scene after the other. Some Euro style violence is thrown in to perk the viewer up but it never helps the film rise above its tired dialogue. Akerman plays her role with palpable sex appeal, however she looks out of place on a secret mission with the typical tight pants and high heels.Basically, this film does not work, and you could do much better when it comes to the spy variety.",1,Cusack on valium,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,812,"['Numbers', 'Game', 'slow', 'paced', 'low', 'interest', 'film', 'movie', 'not', 'new', 'approach', 'spy', 'films', 'reminder', 'how', 'laborious', 'spy', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'Looking', 'heavily', 'sedated', 'times', 'Cusack', 'role', 'last', 'run', 'spy', 'operative', 'whole', 'numbers', 'factor', 'was', 'bit', 'confusing', 'interesting', 'poor', 'narritive', 'venture', 'heavy', 'handededness', 'storyline', 'one', 'boring', 'scene', 'other', 'Euro', 'style', 'violence', 'thrown', 'perk', 'viewer', 'up', 'never', 'film', 'rise', 'tired', 'dialogue', 'Akerman', 'role', 'palpable', 'sex', 'appeal', 'however', 'place', 'secret', 'mission', 'typical', 'tight', 'pants', 'high', 'heels.Basically', 'film', 'not', 'work', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'when', 'spy', 'variety']",The Numbers Station

I'm generally a John Cusack fan, and I really enjoy spy thrillers, but this movie is a particularly poor example of the genre.  To begin with, the premise is stupid (these ""numbers stations"" are purely analog, so supposedly they can't be hacked, but the data to broadcast is apparently transmitted by computer...).  A bad guy wants to send his own codes through the number station so he goes to a lot of trouble to terrorize the female operator into broadcasting his message but later in the movie someone else (not a trained operator) is easily able to broadcast codes over the system... In which case, why all the torture?  Most annoying, the operators are supposedly trained cryptographers, but in fact all they do is read numbers over the air.  They have no idea what the numbers mean.  Then when the bad guy substitutes his own codes, the operator-heroine is suddenly able to decipher them.At the end, we're supposed to believe that the CIA would want to kill its own cryptographer because she ""knows too much"" even though she's saved a dozen people's lives, put her own in jeopardy, and...wait.

Smail ""L""","[6, 8]","The Numbers Station (2013) - John Cusack (Say Anything, Better Off Dead, Grosse Point Blank), Malin Akerman (Children's Hospital), Liam Cunningham (Safe House, Game of Thrones)Premise: Emerson Kent (Cusack), a former hitman, is assigned to guard a broadcaster (Akerman) in a Numbers Station - a broadcast station that transmits targets to assassins in the field. When their location is compromised, Kent is ordered to execute the broadcaster and kill anyone who enters the station - until he realize that he's caught up in a conspiracy he never could have anticipated.Thoughts: This is a direct to DVD film. Solid writing, decent acting - but this is not a mind-blowing film. It's an entertaining, self-contained thriller which is mainly located in the broadcast station. It's a passable thriller - but your mileage may vary at times depending on your feelings towards the leads. Cusack doesn't strike me as the action thriller type - belonging more to the dramatic-comedy genre which defined his early career. He essentially plays a dramatic version of his Martin Blank-character from Grosse Point Blank.Should you buy this: I'd recommend it for a rental.EDIT: This film is apparently not a direct-to-DVD film - due to Apple TV it was available on VOD in early April, which lead me to the false assumption that it was not released theatrically when it has been brought to my attention that it has received a limited release in the US.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[6, 7]","Every now and then, there's a small picture that somehow manages to escape anyone's attention when it plays theatrical.  Typically, this happens when the said movie doesn't quite have a storyline that'll appeal to the biggest, boldest demographic: kids ... or younger adults with disposable incomes.  Sadly, if it doesn't have an alien or a Transformer or a superhero or a laser or a car crash or maybe an accent or even Leo DiCaprio in some role, then it doesn't play to the masses; and a film like THE NUMBERS STATION ends up playing it all too safe by-the-numbers.  It isn't so much a disservice - one could make a strong case that the lack of any clearly drawn characters holds STATION back from being a property worth greater acclaim - but I've always believed there's something to be said for a film that knows what it is, knows what it wants to be, and just delivers on that premise.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Veteran CIA black ops agemt Emerson Kent (played by the reliable John Cusack) ends up incapable of completing a `hit' job in the field, and, as punishment, he's relegated into a dead end position as the supervisor to a distant numbers station - a facility dedicated to dispatching clandestine orders to agents in the field.  However, when his station is compromised, it's up to Kent and his broadcaster Katherine (the equally reliable Malin Ackerman) to avoid assassination, figure out just what the terrorists were up to, and correct it if it isn't too late.THE NUMBERS STATION - which is a smart first script from F. Scott Frazier directed by Kasper Barfoed - defies traditional descriptions.  It feels very much like a Cold War thriller, only there really are no specific adversaries named; there's just the U.S., and someone who's intent on spoiling U.S. interests.  It also feels very much like a locked-box mystery, wherein the protagonists - Emerson and Katherine - are trying to uncover what happened and whether or not the events are fixable.  But it also feels as though it desperately wants to make some kind of political statement on the nature of hidden agendas ... and one has to wonder if all of these threads were too tightly woven to do the resulting picture any good.If one throws all of that aside, then you're left with its most satisfying impression: an old-school thriller.  It's the kind of picture Hollywood used to churn out before so many vanity projects pushed political messages into the theatrical mainstream.  On that front, I thought STATION achieved a good balance - there's just enough characterization for audiences to enjoy the lean 90-minute flick and not have a message hammered home.  There's a respectable amount of action, a palatable amount of intrigue, and an appreciable return on the investment made in the entire affair.Why this one didn't register with audiences when it played in the multiplexes is a mystery to me.  Cusack - when he stays apolitical - is a known commodity though he hasn't had a hit in some time, and one has to wonder how much longer Ackerman will have to flourish in obscure pictures before she breaks through to wider acclaim.  My best guess is the STATION was somewhat dismissed by critics who saw it largely due to the fact that, in today's event-driven environment, a smaller and quieter picture that ends up not necessarily indicting any government just isn't up-to-snuff.  One can almost hear film historians collectively screaming, ""If we're not openly trashing the U.S., then what are we doing?""  STATION takes only a parting shot at an regime, and it's numbly voiced in a single line by Cusack's veteran black ops character: ""It's gotta stop.""  Even then, he's not talking so much about a government as he is a specific practice, and that's not moving enough for Hollywood intelligentsia to wrap their thick skulls around.THE NUMBERS STATION is produced by a whole host of partners, up to and including ContentFilm International, Echo Lake Productions (I), Piccadilly Pictures, and many more (check out the complete list at IMDB.com if you're that interested).  DVD distribution is being handled through RLJ Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, the picture is smartly photographed, and the sound mix is particularly impressive given the fact that sound plays a key element in the unfolding plotline.  As for the special features, alas there's only a fifteen minute obligatory `making of' short that makes slim use of John Cusack; I don't know if he wasn't all that interested in the finished product or what, but he just didn't seem all that interested in being there.  Shame on you, Mr. Cusack; not every film has to carry a weighty message.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  THE NUMBERS STATION has a smart script that maybe - just maybe - takes the audience for granted one times too many.  It didn't receive much notice in its run in theatres, but I'd strongly encourage viewers to give it a go as a rental.  Cusack has played a hitman before (in the stellar GROSS POINTE BLANK); his Emerson Kent here is just a world-weary, but the consequences are far dire.  Ackerman turns in another winning performance, and, together, they maintain a solid chemistry even though some of the paces feel a bit too rehearsed.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at RLJ Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of THE NUMBERS STATION by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,THE NUMBERS STATION Is The Kind

A brief message is sent out, whenever there are new instructions.Both the sender and the receiver have a book of one-use-only decoding instructions.  Senderencrypts and transmits; receiver receives and decodes, and then destroys both the decoded msg.and the page used to decode it.  Since each key is one-use-only, it is extremely difficult orimpossible to crack (unless of course you can get your hands on the source code before it isdestroyed).  Cusack plays a CIA agent who had a bit of a failure in his last field assignment.  So as&#34;punishment&#34; he is sent to a remote transmission station in England, as the night-shift agentassigned to guard the transmitter (a civilian working on a contract basis).  Naturally of course, itturns out to be anything but a boring backwater assignment.  Shortly after he arrives all hell breaksloose.  The day shift staff have been murdered.  Someone wants into the (naturally secret) stationand access to the latest code, for their own purposes.The acting is decent.  Initially Cusack despises his assignment and has little respect for the contractor;nor does she particularly like him.  But when they find themselves alone and under attack, that's whenwe find out whether they can handle it and where their loyalties lie.  It's a rather claustrophobic thrillersince it seemed 90% of it took place at night and underground in this station.  It was fairly violent butthere is no sex, no nudity, no focus on gore, and no more swearing than one would expect in that kindof situation.

As the movie opens, we see Emerson involved in an assassination of several targets but it all goes horribly wrong when the daughter of one of the targets comes onto the scene. Unable to ""retire"" her, Emerson's boss Gray (played by Liam Cunningham) does so instead, but he promptly demotes Emerson away from the field. Next we see that Emerson has been assigned to guard the broadcaster, a woman named Katherine (played by Malin kerman), of a ""numbers station"" in the country side near Suffolk, England. As the movie explains, a numbers station broadcasts (in short wave) secret messages in numbers to agents in the field, giving them new assignments. Not long after, the numbers station is attacked and infiltrated, and all kinds of trouble and mayham ensues. Why is the numbers station being attacked? Will Emerson and Katherine make it out alive? Is there double-play at hand anywhere? To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, John Cusack! Yes, Cusack is front and center in this movie, he is in fact in every scene and in virually every shot. Aging gracefully, yet maintaining that boyish face, Cusack carries the movie from start to finish, and for me he is reason enough to watch and enjoy this movie. But wait! there is more! Malin kerman as the person Cusack needs to protect is equally delightful, oozing charm (and, let's be honest, looks as well). She is playing the role of Debbie Harry in the upcoming movie ""CBGB"" later this year, can't wait for that. When I saw the end credits role of this movie, I couldn't help but notice it had tons of international co-production assists (including VFX from Belgium, where I grew up).Imagine my surprise when ""The Numbers Station"" showed up this weekend out of nowhere and without any pre-release buzz or ads on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati. So I decided to go see it right away, as I figure this won't stick around long. As it turned out, I got a private screening of it. Yes indeed, I was the only person in the theatre! Weird.

1636378,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00BNH9NCU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","The Numbers Station (Kasper Barfoed, 2013)This could easily be a four-word review. (For those of you reading it at Popcorn: the subtitle was the initial review.) But, you know, Amazon requires at least twenty words, so I figure I might as well throw in a plot synopsis and at least one gratuitous reference to a couple of other thrillers this put me in mind of all too many times.Emerson Kent (Fat Man and Little Boy's John Cusack) is a wet work guy for the American government. (For those of you not up on your spy thrillers or conspiracy theory: that means he kills people on governmental orders.) His boss, Grey (Safe House's Liam Cunningham), goes out with him on the mission that opens the movie (we find out the identity of the subject later; it is germane to what I assume was supposed to be Emerson Kent's growth trajectory during the film, though that misfired pretty much constantly). It goes haywire when an innocent bystander enters the picture, resulting in a short, but ugly, trail of bodies. Kent begins to have doubts about his work, so the Agency gives him the equivalent of a desk job: babysitting the broadcaster at a numbers station, Katherine (Watchmen's Malin Akerman). Not long into the assignment, the two of them are driving to the station when they're ambushed. After they've gotten inside and Kent calls for evacuation, he's told to kill Katherine, as she's been compromised. This, of course, puts him in exactly the same situation he was in before, except this time, the folks who were shooting at them are just on the other side of the door, and they've got power tools.On the one hand, I realize I'm coming down extra-hard on this movie because someone finally got around to making a movie about numbers stations and it turns out to be as mediocre as, well, The Numbers Station. I was expecting way more from this movie than most people probably were, and I didn't get it. And then there's John Cusack playing a contract killer. Yeah, I didn't like Grosse Pointe Blank, either. I try not to typecast people, honest I do, but Lloyd Dobler is walking around with a gun in his hand. What would Peter Gabriel think of this?On the other hand, there is a lot of Charisma in this movie. Not the trait, the excellent Kiyoshi Kurosawa film from 1998 that plays with identities in crisis in exactly the same way this movie tries (and fails) to. If F. Scott Frazier, turning in his first screenplay, had paid a little more attention to Kurosawa, he might have gotten this way more right than he did. It's as if he took the seeds of Charisma and crossed them with any number of other mediocre thrillers, though the one I'm most put in mind of--probably because I saw it mere weeks ago--is the Wesley Snipes vehicle Game of Death. The Numbers Station and Game of Death share a seeming desire to cater to the lowest common denominator, and that pretty much spells their doom at ever rising above the tired pack. Still, it's another one of those ""if you have nothing to do on Saturday night"" movies. That said, if you have nothing better to do on Saturday night, do yourself a huge favor and rent Charisma instead. **",2,The By-the-numbers Station.,1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,3132,"['Numbers', 'Station', 'Kasper', 'Barfoed', '2013', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'four-word', 'review', 'reading', 'Popcorn', 'subtitle', 'was', 'initial', 'review', 'know', 'Amazon', 'least', 'twenty', 'words', 'figure', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'throw', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'least', 'one', 'gratuitous', 'reference', 'couple', 'other', 'thrillers', 'put', 'mind', 'too', 'many', 'times.Emerson', 'Kent', 'Fat', 'Man', 'Little', 'Boy', 'John', 'Cusack', 'wet', 'work', 'guy', 'American', 'government', 'not', 'up', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'people', 'governmental', 'orders', 'boss', 'Grey', 'Safe', 'House', 'Liam', 'Cunningham', 'out', 'mission', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'identity', 'subject', 'later', 'germane', 'what', 'assume', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Emerson', 'Kent', 'growth', 'trajectory', 'film', 'misfired', 'pretty', 'much', 'constantly', 'haywire', 'when', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'picture', 'resulting', 'short', 'ugly', 'trail', 'bodies', 'Kent', 'have', 'doubts', 'work', 'Agency', 'equivalent', 'desk', 'job', 'babysitting', 'broadcaster', 'numbers', 'station', 'Katherine', 'Watchmen', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'Not', 'long', 'assignment', 'two', 'are', 'driving', 'station', 'when', ""'re"", 'ambushed', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'Kent', 'evacuation', 'told', 'kill', 'Katherine', 'been', 'compromised', 'course', 'exactly', 'same', 'situation', 'was', 'time', 'folks', 'who', 'were', 'shooting', 'are', 'just', 'other', 'side', 'door', ""'ve"", 'got', 'power', 'one', 'hand', 'realize', ""'m"", 'coming', 'down', 'extra-hard', 'movie', 'someone', 'finally', 'got', 'making', 'movie', 'numbers', 'stations', 'out', 'be', 'as', 'mediocre', 'well', 'Numbers', 'Station', 'was', 'expecting', 'way', 'more', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'probably', 'were', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'then', 'John', 'Cusack', 'playing', 'contract', 'killer', 'Yeah', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'either', 'try', 'not', 'typecast', 'people', 'honest', 'do', 'Lloyd', 'Dobler', 'walking', 'around', 'gun', 'hand', 'What', 'would', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'think', 'other', 'hand', 'lot', 'Charisma', 'movie', 'Not', 'trait', 'excellent', 'Kiyoshi', 'Kurosawa', 'film', '1998', 'identities', 'crisis', 'exactly', 'same', 'way', 'movie', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Frazier', 'turning', 'first', 'screenplay', 'had', 'paid', 'little', 'more', 'attention', 'Kurosawa', 'might', 'have', 'gotten', 'way', 'more', 'right', 'did', 'took', 'seeds', 'Charisma', 'crossed', 'number', 'other', 'mediocre', 'thrillers', 'one', ""'m"", 'most', 'put', 'mind', 'probably', 'saw', 'mere', 'weeks', 'ago', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'vehicle', 'Game', 'Death', 'Numbers', 'Station', 'Game', 'Death', 'share', 'seeming', 'desire', 'cater', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'pretty', 'much', 'spells', 'doom', 'ever', 'rising', 'tired', 'pack', 'Still', 'one', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'Saturday', 'night', 'movies', 'said', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'Saturday', 'night', 'do', 'huge', 'favor', 'rent', 'Charisma', 'instead', '**']",The Numbers Station

1636392,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00BNH9NCU,Todd Smith,"[2, 3]","John Cusack is a terrific actor and he proves it once again in The Numbers Station. Recently, Cusack has done a lot more direct-to-video stuff, deciding to be a big fish in a much smaller pond, and it has worked out very well. The Numbers Station is a secret CIA base in a secluded part of England, where encoded messages are sent to agents in the field. Emerson (John Cusack) was one of those agents, until his conscience caught up with him, and he is assigned to guard the station, a quiet, lonely job, until terrorists break in, and he is the last line of defense. A movie like this, with a small cast in a secluded location, only works if the stars of the film can keep you're attention and make the story believable, and both Cusack and Malin Akerman both do a terrific job of it. This movie is more about the intensity of the situation and the reaction of the people involved than it is about killing bad guys, and that is why Cusack was perfect choice for the lead in this film. Few actors bring the experience of intensity that John Cusack brings to a project. The story here, wasn't anything unique or extraordinary, but it was an action film from a more psychological point of few. Most action films are more about big explosions and special effects, the story is secondary, but in The Numbers Station, things are reversed and that's why I liked it so much. It's a fun film, that will keep you guessing, with a cast that will engage you the whole way.

Sweeney,"[0, 0]","A burnt-out black ops agent is sent to a top secret numbers station in Suffolk where messages for secret assignments are sent to other black ops. When he and the operator discover the night shift team dead and the station in shambles, he's ordered to close down the station and kill the operator. While he hesitates, the invading team again attacks the station again. In the following showdown, he discovers new messages were sent out, ordering the assassination of the top 15 men in the CIA. Now he has several choices to make...kill the agent and get himself out alive, try to cancel the orders, defend the station, or just blow everything to Hell.A tense film, starting with a particularly brutal scene in which three innocent bystanders are murdered for witnessing the assassination of a former black ops agent. One is tracked to his home and killed along with his teenaged daughter. This sets quite plainly the reason for the agent's transfer to the relative peace and monotony of the numbers station. The rest of the story is mostly action and will he/won't he? as he mentally fights against following the orders to kill the woman he's supposed to be guarding.There's not much time given to building up a rapport between the two characters but it does seem to be there, if reluctantly on his part. LIttle background is given to make the viewer hold much sympathy for the character, other than his refusal the kill the teenager as she runs after him begging to know why he shot her father, only to be gunned down by his handler. A few off-handed remarks here and there between him and the station operator are the only other clues to his character and hers. The rest is their having to rely on each other while they fight to get out of the station.Probably if one were to analyze the script,  there are a million holes in this story but sitting back and just enjoying it without critiquing is the best way to go...I found it a tight drama with enough doubt as to the operator's fate to make it tense.",4,"Tight, tense drama",1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,2005,"['burnt-out', 'black', 'ops', 'agent', 'sent', 'top', 'secret', 'numbers', 'station', 'Suffolk', 'where', 'messages', 'secret', 'assignments', 'are', 'sent', 'other', 'black', 'ops', 'When', 'operator', 'discover', 'night', 'shift', 'team', 'dead', 'station', 'shambles', 'ordered', 'close', 'down', 'station', 'kill', 'operator', 'invading', 'team', 'again', 'station', 'again', 'following', 'showdown', 'new', 'messages', 'were', 'sent', 'out', 'ordering', 'assassination', 'top', '15', 'men', 'CIA', 'Now', 'several', 'choices', 'make', 'kill', 'agent', 'get', 'out', 'alive', 'try', 'cancel', 'orders', 'defend', 'station', 'just', 'blow', 'everything', 'Hell.A', 'tense', 'film', 'starting', 'particularly', 'brutal', 'scene', 'three', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'are', 'murdered', 'witnessing', 'assassination', 'former', 'black', 'ops', 'agent', 'One', 'tracked', 'home', 'killed', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'quite', 'plainly', 'reason', 'agent', 'transfer', 'relative', 'peace', 'monotony', 'numbers', 'station', 'rest', 'story', 'mostly', 'action', 'will', 'he/wo', ""n't"", 'mentally', 'following', 'orders', 'kill', 'woman', 'supposed', 'be', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'given', 'building', 'up', 'rapport', 'two', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'there', 'reluctantly', 'part', 'LIttle', 'background', 'given', 'make', 'viewer', 'hold', 'much', 'sympathy', 'character', 'other', 'refusal', 'kill', 'teenager', 'begging', 'know', 'why', 'shot', 'father', 'only', 'be', 'gunned', 'down', 'handler', 'few', 'off-handed', 'remarks', 'here', 'there', 'station', 'operator', 'are', 'only', 'other', 'clues', 'character', 'hers', 'rest', 'having', 'rely', 'other', 'fight', 'get', 'station.Probably', 'one', 'were', 'analyze', 'script', 'are', 'million', 'holes', 'story', 'sitting', 'back', 'just', 'enjoying', 'critiquing', 'best', 'way', 'go', 'found', 'tight', 'drama', 'enough', 'doubt', 'operator', 'fate', 'make', 'tense']",The Numbers Station

After Emerson (Cusack) has a problem during a routine assignment he is reassigned to a safe house type area making sure secret codes are transmitted out to the government properly. When the boring routine job becomes infiltrated it is up to him and his new partner to protect the house. I have said this the last few Cusack movies but I think I need to say it again...does he need help? The movies he is picking are really just a step above made-for-TV and I wonder why. The idea for this movie is a neat idea but the overall execution of it is a little slow and really hard to get into. I tried hard to get into it but for me it was a struggle and I lost interest pretty quick. The end I will admit was OK but getting to that point almost didn't seem worth it. Even though it may not sound like it but I have seen worse lately but don't expect a full on action movie from this. Overall, slow and hard to get into, a movie I think Cusack did for money.

These shortwave radio stations are called numbers station, which is also the title of this OK thriller.In ""The Numbers Station"" John Cusack is Emerson Kent, a government operative whose latest mission went terribly wrong. Discredited, Emerson is sent to an underground numbers station in a rural British area, where he works with a young code operator Katherine (Malin Akerman). When the station is compromised, however, Emerson is faced with a difficult moral choice, while trying to survive.It seems Danish director Kasper Barfoed does not know what kind of film he is trying to make. If it is a thriller, ""The Numbers Station"" is simply boring with not much mystery to solve; if it is a character study, two main characters Emerson and Katherine are just flat. Also, the storyline is predictable, and as to the intriguing idea of numbers station, it is eventually forgotten as the story goes on.The low-budget thriller starts with one interesting idea, which the filmmakers failed to develop.
