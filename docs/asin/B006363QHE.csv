This show does not have the traditional &#34;laugh track&#34;.  All shows in the series were filmed in a theater with a live studio audience.  This &#34;real&#34; audience benefits the actors and makes them aware of the comic value as the show progresses.  Have not yet seen every episode.  After there are 7 years of shows.  And yes, the one episode that the public has raved for years, back in the days when the tapes were not available for the series IS IN THE COLLECTION.  All of the shows are in the collection.

1508981,A1KRPOQQ8LQK0R,B006363QHE,"Betty L. Detwiler ""bookie""","[3, 5]","While the show is great with super actors, I am extremely disappointed in how the dvds from the first two seasons operate.  There is no play all selection so you have to watch the shows individually. When one show is done, you have to scroll through several options in order to get back to the main menu which makes viewing these seasons rather slow.  After watching through season 6, I have found I enjoy the earlier shows much more. Once Valerie Harper and Cloris Leachman left, the plot lines got rather mundane and repetitious.  When Mary moves to a new apartment in season 6, to me the show lost even more momentum.  Also, apparently some of the shows in season 6 were taped out of order or were put on the DVD's out of order.  Mary moves into a new apartment with new furniture but around episode 6 the furniture went back to the first apartment furniture.  Then in episode 9 the new furniture returns.  I would have liked to have seen included on the dvd's the episode from Rhoda where Mary and the whole WJM staff go to Rhoda's wedding which I did see when Rhoda reruns were on television. Not a bad investment, but the later shows just fall flat.",3,"Great show, loses momentum",1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,1155,"['show', 'great', 'super', 'actors', 'am', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'how', 'dvds', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'operate', 'play', 'selection', 'so', 'have', 'watch', 'shows', 'individually', 'When', 'one', 'show', 'done', 'have', 'scroll', 'several', 'options', 'order', 'get', 'back', 'main', 'menu', 'viewing', 'seasons', 'rather', 'slow', 'watching', 'season', '6', 'have', 'found', 'enjoy', 'earlier', 'shows', 'much', 'more', 'Once', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'left', 'plot', 'lines', 'got', 'rather', 'mundane', 'repetitious', 'When', 'Mary', 'new', 'apartment', 'season', '6', 'show', 'lost', 'even', 'more', 'momentum', 'Also', 'apparently', 'shows', 'season', '6', 'were', 'taped', 'order', 'were', 'put', 'DVD', 'out', 'order', 'Mary', 'moves', 'new', 'apartment', 'new', 'furniture', 'episode', '6', 'furniture', 'went', 'back', 'first', 'apartment', 'furniture', 'Then', 'episode', '9', 'new', 'furniture', 'returns', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'included', 'dvd', 'episode', 'Rhoda', 'where', 'Mary', 'whole', 'WJM', 'staff', 'go', 'Rhoda', 'wedding', 'did', 'see', 'when', 'Rhoda', 'reruns', 'were', 'television', 'Not', 'bad', 'investment', 'later', 'shows', 'just', 'fall', 'flat']",Mary Tyler Moore Seasons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1-7 Complete Series

It is up to you to decide if this matters)------------------------------------------------------EDIT: After much discussion in the comment section I would like to clear something up. I originally had an oversight in my review that there were no special features. I was in correct and changed my review. I had a clear statement in the comments explaining this. After a few more comments I have decided to bring this forward to the main review.There are features that came packed in with the first two seasons. After those two seasons there was limited additional special features. That information is actually comprehensive and I am sorry that my first review was inaccurate.On my end these original seasons were watched as they came out and I would say that I became a jaded viewer when seeing fox not add any more content. Over the years as a customer it becomes more and more depressing to have to wait for more releases. At one point they stopped releasing individual seasons and just released the whole series as a single set. This would mean you were forced to rebuy seasons if you wanted to see the previously unreleased seasons.Over the years fox seemed to abandon this DVD series and I guess my bitterness led to me writing an inaccurate review. I will be adjusting this and I am sorry to have allowed my bias to skew my review.------------------------------------------------------Finally, this show is great and is worth the price of the DVDs but unfortunately Fox didn't do much to make this stand out. It probably doesn't really matter though. If you purchase this I'm sure you will spend a lot of time laughing.",4,"Great show, lame packaging",1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,2764,"['be', 'expected', 'show', 'still', 'fantastic', 'unfortunately', 'fox', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'put', 'effort', 'creating', 'DVDs', 'particularly', 'second', 'seasonPros', 'package', 'episode', 'ever-', 'episodes', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'edited', 'versions-', 'When', 'buy', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'episode', 'where', 'chuckles', 'want-', 'stand', 'get', 'good', 'discount', 'bundle', 'season', '15', 'dollars', 'bought', 'separately', 'bonus', 'features', 'most', 'were', 'put', 'together', 'relation', 'early', 'seasons.Cons-', 'Fox', 'did', 'nothing', 'make', 'DVDs', 'special-', 'video', 'quality', ""n't"", 'been', 'touched', 'everything', 'still', 'very', 'grainy-', 'just', 'amazon', 'repackaging', 'original', 'DVDs', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'new', 'fancy', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'before-', 'set', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'episode', 'lists', 'season', '6-', 'Special', 'features', 'content', 'stops', 'mostly', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'last', 'bit', 'was', 'initially', 'big', 'deal', 'have', 'become', 'bitter', 'fox', 'eventually', 'abandoning', 'series', 'many', 'other', 'commenters', 'have', 'noted', 'more', 'enough', 'present', 'early', 'seasons', 'up', 'decide', 'matters', 'EDIT', 'much', 'discussion', 'comment', 'section', 'would', 'like', 'clear', 'something', 'up', 'originally', 'had', 'oversight', 'review', 'were', 'special', 'features', 'was', 'correct', 'changed', 'review', 'had', 'clear', 'statement', 'comments', 'explaining', 'few', 'more', 'comments', 'have', 'decided', 'bring', 'forward', 'main', 'review.There', 'are', 'features', 'came', 'packed', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'two', 'seasons', 'there', 'was', 'limited', 'additional', 'special', 'features', 'information', 'actually', 'comprehensive', 'am', 'sorry', 'first', 'review', 'was', 'inaccurate.On', 'end', 'original', 'seasons', 'were', 'watched', 'came', 'would', 'say', 'became', 'jaded', 'viewer', 'when', 'seeing', 'fox', 'not', 'add', 'more', 'content', 'years', 'customer', 'more', 'more', 'depressing', 'have', 'wait', 'more', 'releases', 'one', 'point', 'stopped', 'releasing', 'individual', 'seasons', 'just', 'released', 'whole', 'series', 'single', 'set', 'would', 'mean', 'were', 'forced', 'rebuy', 'seasons', 'wanted', 'see', 'previously', 'unreleased', 'seasons.Over', 'years', 'fox', 'seemed', 'abandon', 'DVD', 'series', 'guess', 'bitterness', 'led', 'writing', 'inaccurate', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'adjusting', 'am', 'sorry', 'have', 'allowed', 'bias', 'skew', 'review.', 'Finally', 'show', 'great', 'price', 'DVDs', 'unfortunately', 'Fox', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'probably', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'purchase', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'laughing']",Mary Tyler Moore Seasons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1-7 Complete Series

1508990,A4UGMKUSX9XHI,B006363QHE,Robert Stone,"[19, 20]","I was delighted to see this series come available for such a good price. I have many fond memories of watching this show with my parents years ago. It is difficult to overestimate the influence the show had and still has - I think it did a lot to change society's attitude toward women by portraying Mary as such a strong, independent person. Compared to other shows in its day, it was groundbreaking and paved the way for many shows which have imitated but not duplicated its formula. With an absolutely fabulous ensemble cast this show is still great today.But, if you are reading this review you already know what a great series this is so I won't waste any more words there. I mainly wanted to write this review to convey picture quality to those interested in the set.After reading some early reviews noting the picture is grainy I immediately opened up my just-arrived pack. Each season is in a separate holder. So far, I've looked at several episodes and it looks good. The film when transferred was pretty clean, occasional spots are noted but nothing that most people will see unless looking for it. This is a DVD (not Blu-Ray) so of course it is not HD but it upscales well and looks fine on an HD TV. In short, I think it is a good transfer and makes the series look as good or better than I have ever seen it on broadcast TV.In summary, you should not let any concern about picture quality make you hesitate from buying this classic series. I doubt that a Blu-Ray version of this will ever be made and even if it was I don't think the show would benefit from it. Buy with confidence and enjoy it from the first awkward meeting with Mr. Grant to the final moving group hug!",5,"A Great Show, Good Picture Quality",1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,1684,"['was', 'delighted', 'see', 'series', 'come', 'available', 'such', 'good', 'price', 'have', 'many', 'fond', 'memories', 'watching', 'show', 'parents', 'years', 'ago', 'difficult', 'overestimate', 'influence', 'show', 'had', 'still', 'think', 'did', 'lot', 'change', 'society', 'attitude', 'women', 'portraying', 'Mary', 'such', 'strong', 'independent', 'person', 'Compared', 'other', 'shows', 'day', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'paved', 'way', 'many', 'shows', 'have', 'imitated', 'not', 'duplicated', 'formula', 'absolutely', 'fabulous', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'show', 'still', 'great', 'today.But', 'are', 'reading', 'review', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'great', 'series', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'more', 'words', 'there', 'mainly', 'wanted', 'write', 'review', 'convey', 'picture', 'quality', 'interested', 'set.After', 'reading', 'early', 'reviews', 'noting', 'picture', 'grainy', 'immediately', 'opened', 'up', 'just-arrived', 'pack', 'season', 'separate', 'holder', 'So', 'far', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'several', 'episodes', 'good', 'film', 'when', 'transferred', 'was', 'pretty', 'clean', 'occasional', 'spots', 'are', 'noted', 'nothing', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'see', 'looking', 'DVD', 'not', 'Blu-Ray', 'so', 'course', 'not', 'HD', 'well', 'fine', 'HD', 'TV', 'short', 'think', 'good', 'transfer', 'series', 'look', 'good', 'better', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'broadcast', 'TV.In', 'summary', 'should', 'not', 'let', 'concern', 'picture', 'quality', 'make', 'hesitate', 'buying', 'classic', 'series', 'doubt', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'made', 'even', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'show', 'would', 'benefit', 'Buy', 'confidence', 'enjoy', 'first', 'awkward', 'meeting', 'Mr.', 'Grant', 'final', 'moving', 'group', 'hug']",Mary Tyler Moore Seasons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1-7 Complete Series

You probably think so too, otherwise you wouldn't be looking at this listing.To get all 7 seasons, on DVD, in good packaging is just icing on the cake.  Each season is in an individual case, with all of the DVDs for that season in it.  The cases are durable plastic and the disks are held firmly inside in sort of an alternating layout so they don't take up so much room with the artwork you see in the listing photo.I am just half way through the first disk.  The picture is clear, and the color is vibrant and sharp.  But, of course, we are talking about 70's TV.  There are special features and a few commentaries (although there might be more later), but honestly having the show itself is enough for me.To see Mary and all the gang again is so awesome.  The comedy from that time is so funny and always makes me feel good.  Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, MTM, Maude are all so good and so much, much better than watching yet another season of ""Two and a half dreks"" or ""Southpark"".

1508992,A14OB7YKMPBJLW,B006363QHE,Susan Fong,"[44, 46]","During the 1970's, CBS created a golden age of great comedy.  Among them was the ""Carol Burnett Show"", ""Bob Newhart Show"", ""MASH"", and the groundbreaking ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"".  This series centered around a single young woman who becomes producer of the news at a Minneapolis television station.The ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was different from its predecessors because it portrayed a thirtyish woman who is smart, capable, independent, and happy being single.  The episodes spent as much time examining Mary in the workplace as they did chronicling her social life.The quality of writing for the ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was consistently intelligent, mature, and funny without being crude or condescending to audiences.The characters on MTM were so richly developed by the writers and a brilliant acting ensemble that audiences could see them as real people, not one-dimensional caricatures.  You came to love and understand them:  Mary Richards, intelligent and vivacious, generous, and level-headed.  Lou Grant, Mary's boss, gruff yet fair.  Ted Baxter, anchorman, vain and self-absorbed, but also childlike and vulnerable.  Murray Slaughter, Mary's supportive co-worker and foil to Ted Baxter.  Rhoda Morgenstern, Mary's sarcastic and street-wise best friend who has a soft heart.  And Phyllis Lindstrom, Mary's highly educated old friend who can act pretentious but means well.You really wanted to know and root for the people in Mary's life despite their flaws.  They must have had something going for them if Mary cared about them.And regarding Mary Tyler Moore herself, she is one of the most beautiful and talented actresses to ever grace television.  Her comedic timing and instincts are almost peerless.  (To me, only Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett, Candice Bergen, and the casts of ""The Golden Girls"" and ""Designing Women"" could match Mary's skill.)  But the quality that shines most about this genuine legend and star is her humanity.  You just sense that Mary Richards/Mary Tyler Moore is a good person.  She is kind and respectful, and in turn we respect her.It is lamentable that most current ""comedies"" are tasteless exhibitions of people's worst behavior.  The ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" offers us a more noble and enlightened view of human nature while still acknowledging our frailties.  And in the process, this landmark series made us laugh, cry, and think.

I have only watched the first two seasons though and am now taking a break to watch my usual July movies.  The way that Mary's home life and her work life are blended together in this series is very nice.  All the acting is excellent, and the list of acting awards won by members of the cast is very long and distinguished.  It doesn't take very many episodes to notice the wonderful comic timing among the cast members.  The guest stars  are also quite interestng to see. I would recommend this series for anyone who likes classic comedy.",5,The way that Mary's home life and her work life are blended together in this series is very nice.
