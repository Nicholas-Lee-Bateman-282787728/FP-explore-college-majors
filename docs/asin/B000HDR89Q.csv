I reccomend this to girls who liked Hunter X Hunter & Yu-Yu Hakusho. It's however shoujo enough that guys don't seem to like it. Those that do don't care for Reload or Gunlock, & those that do usually don't tell their anime lovin' guyfriends about that.

It's so colorful and with an COOOL story to match. Saiyuki is also for adults. So make sure the young kids don't walk in the room while watching it.Back to the story one word AWESOME! Sometimes when I'm watching a TV show I get bored and I watch the clock, I can honestly say that didn't happen watching this Anime! Everytime a esp ended I just watched the next one wanting to see what would happen next!Oh and the music is so catchy! My favorite is the second season opening theme song.

1013136,AFV2584U13XP3,B000HDR89Q,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[2, 3]","If you've seen the series on t.v.(Channel G4 on Cox Digital) you know most of the series is around the four characters Genjo Sanzo(A powerful spiritual priest with a nasty disposition and sarcastic mentality), Cho Hakkai(The most level-headed of the quartet who was once human but became a demon after killing the demon who raped his fiancee and his minions), Sha Gojyo(A half human/demon who is a great ladies charmer, drinker, and gambler but has a sad lonely past because his mother couldn't except his mixed heritage and hated him), and finally Son Goku(A demon whose appetite for food holds no limits he was imprisoned for an unknown crime an was freed by Genjo Sanzo).  The short story plot is for some unknown reason the harmony between demons and humans has been shattered and now the demons are attacking humans everywhere as such the spiritual leaders order Sanzo and his friends to find the reason why this is happening and try an restore the harmony between demons and humans.  The animation isn't bad as it's pretty clear and sharp but like some reviewers have said it's somewhat annoying when you see the fight scenes.  What I mean is when you see them battle there is no actual movement to much but still cut-scenes like if Goku throws a punch it shows as Goku with his character drawn with his fist raised and the next scene his enemy on the his back on the ground but no other actual animation movements.  So again don't expect to see any movement in the fight scenes to much but just still shots and the action sounds of the battle instead.  Still if you don't mind that to much the rest of the series is still pretty good with a lot of other characters that you come to like through the series as well.  The audio was great though I liked who they got to play the quartet for the dubbed version as well as the main villains as well and as always the Japanese voice actors did a superb job as well.  So if you like your fighting animes with a touch of humor and drama this series might be a good pick for your collection...",4,An Entertaining Series But Also Somewhat Annoying As Well,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,2041,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 't.v', 'Channel', 'G4', 'Cox', 'Digital', 'know', 'most', 'series', 'four', 'characters', 'Genjo', 'Sanzo', 'A', 'powerful', 'spiritual', 'priest', 'nasty', 'disposition', 'sarcastic', 'mentality', 'Cho', 'Hakkai', 'most', 'level-headed', 'quartet', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'human', 'became', 'demon', 'killing', 'demon', 'who', 'raped', 'fiancee', 'minions', 'Sha', 'Gojyo', 'A', 'half', 'human/demon', 'who', 'great', 'ladies', 'charmer', 'drinker', 'gambler', 'sad', 'lonely', 'mother', 'could', ""n't"", 'except', 'mixed', 'heritage', 'hated', 'finally', 'Son', 'Goku', 'A', 'demon', 'appetite', 'food', 'limits', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'unknown', 'crime', 'was', 'freed', 'Genjo', 'Sanzo', 'short', 'story', 'plot', 'unknown', 'reason', 'harmony', 'demons', 'humans', 'been', 'shattered', 'now', 'demons', 'are', 'attacking', 'humans', 'everywhere', 'such', 'spiritual', 'leaders', 'order', 'Sanzo', 'friends', 'find', 'reason', 'why', 'happening', 'try', 'restore', 'harmony', 'demons', 'humans', 'animation', ""n't"", 'bad', 'pretty', 'clear', 'sharp', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'when', 'see', 'fight', 'scenes', 'What', 'mean', 'when', 'see', 'battle', 'actual', 'movement', 'much', 'still', 'cut-scenes', 'Goku', 'punch', 'Goku', 'character', 'drawn', 'fist', 'raised', 'next', 'scene', 'enemy', 'back', 'ground', 'other', 'actual', 'animation', 'movements', 'So', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'movement', 'fight', 'scenes', 'much', 'just', 'still', 'shots', 'action', 'battle', 'instead', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'much', 'rest', 'series', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'lot', 'other', 'characters', 'come', 'like', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'audio', 'was', 'great', 'liked', 'who', 'got', 'play', 'quartet', 'dubbed', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'villains', 'well', 'always', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'like', 'fighting', 'animes', 'touch', 'humor', 'drama', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'pick', 'collection']",Saiyuki: Complete Seasons 1 & 2

Even in a treatment, you'll still get better quality of picture and audio to see. I'm startin' to love this show. A favorite character I like about the show is Genjyo Sanzo who's out on a mission to stop the resurrection of the demon king (Gyumaoh) while traveling westward to India with his idiotic companions (Son Goku, Sha Gojyo, and Cho Hakkai). While on their way, they're beset by inept assasins, bad weather, and their own tragic personal pasts. I might recommend this product to anyone. Get ready to gun out by buying this product and whip it out for a whole adventure or you can forget it since a whole brief of comedy is what you have to put with.

I loved the japanese version with the english subs. You often have to give it to the japanese voice actors, they can also do a outstanding job on showing the true emotions of the characters. I love this series so much. 4 hot bad a** guys are suppose to save the world and try to stay alive doing so day by day when demons attack. One is the priest and the other 3 are half breed demons. Kwel something worth watching that is funny, action pack and sometimes they show feelings. This series was so funny in english and japanese, but I normally watch in english bein that I can only understand that kind of language.DUH.1). english version was a 6 out of 10.I didn't like Hakkai's voice in english it should of been more gentle. the guy sounded to deep and it just didn't work for me, but everyone else was ok, but Sanzo did cuss alot more than in the japanese version. I really didn't feel for the english which was really weird dudes 7 chicks.2) japanese with subtitles was 9 out of 10.I loved the japanese version better really. The actors in the japanese version just moved me and drawed me in to everything they said. But they had subs for the english version subs and the japanese version subs. Awesome i thought them putting the real version that was made with the remake version subs was a good idea.Good job ADV films. Everynow and then you guys can do a good job, but mostly not always and you guys always leave out the extras in the thin packs, like yet again this and even the anime series Getbackers which is pretty good but also recommend it mostly to girls really. It's got alot of hotty bad boy guys again in that series, but it was a good series.All in all this series is something to watch but if you are a type of person who does both english and japanese languages please do the english first cause you probably get upset too, when you find out your sweet, nice guy with a smile, that his the perfect sweet gentle voice changes in a some what smart a** jerk that has a deeper sound and doesn't have that right feel for the character. Anyways GREAT ANIME and the MUSIC IS AWESOME for the first and second season I thought. I got the entire collections of cds which are hard to find now and rare cds. Check out my other reviews I also write about manga and you might see a cd in there every now and then. Ok laterI really laughed on this series and alot of action. the guys are awesome.",5,Bad Boys saving people??
