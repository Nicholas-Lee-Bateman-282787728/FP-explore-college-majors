It's about a young college man who gives off electrical charges from his body (an old parlor trick); he comes to Newport one season early in the 20th century and begins to transform people. There is an exuberance and optimism that rub off on these stuffy summer people, and they begin to come to life in a way they've never experienced before. And, of course, there are those electrical charges, which some residents swear to as having magical healing powers. As reality, this movie would never work, but it has a fairy tale quality about it that transcends believability and allows us to just enjoy the proceedings.

Baker ""Stan's Biographer""","[0, 3]","As with other magnetic media, I was so looking forward to getting rid of my old VHS cassette of Mr. North, and so I bought this movie in DVD format.  Fortunately, I kept the original release, having had negative experiences in the past with re-releases (masquerading as remastery.  HINT!  Remastery is nothing more than a ""BS"" code word for modern technological vandalizm.  Some idiot decides to tinker, tweak, carve up, butcher, mangle, and thoroughly destroy an original work of art by superimposing their spin on a story. They chop up someone elses work and make a kindergarten collage of the pieces and then pawn it off as a ""Remastery.""  What a crock!  Fortunately, Mr. North suffers this indignity in only a few minor ways.  The opening credits have been reworked, replacing the opening scenes of Mr. North's bicycle trek around Rhode Island with some hoaky billboard style credits.  The opening music still plays, but there are no visuals.  And, somewhere along the way, 3 minutes have been added to the overall length of the original film, but I haven't quite figured out where that was done yet.  This is just one example of the many negative reviews I have submitted regarding remastery at its very worst. Many artists, (musicians, film producers, directors, etc.) in all forms of media have had their works destroyed in this fashion.  Buddy Holly's original master recordings have mostly been overdubbed, and the film ""The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea""  was chopped all to hell shortly before its release on VHS back in the 80's.  It's akin to drawing a mustache on the original Mona Lisa in the Louvre museum, or busting the head off of Michaelangelo's David.

Danny Huston's directorial debut was met with mixed reaction, but this film never fails to entertain. It's simple, sweet and a bit profound (based on Thornton Wilder) and the attention to 1920's period detail is intact. The most fun thing is the exemplary ensemble cast that Mr. Huston assembled (no doubt with help from father, John, who was co-writer). Anjelica Huston, Mary Stuart Masterson, Tammy Grimes, Virginia Madsen, Harry Dean Stanton, the wonderful Lauren Bacall, and, most notably, the GREAT Robert Mitchum. Holding it all together,in a wonderfully confident fashion, is a young Anthony Edwards in the title role. He is an Everyman, knowing he is better than his lot, talented and confident enough to fulfill his dream. A fine cameo from the great playwright, Christopher Durang, is also a pleasure.

I guess that is the price you pay for trying to squeeze a lot of book into just 2 hours of movie.  Still, I liked the movie in it's own right.  I liked the actors and I liked the light way it was treated.  The book (Theophilus North by Thornton Wilder) was written late in the life of the author and was more like a series of stories about the same place and time (Newport, Rhode Island in the 20's).  It was probably written from the journals and notes of the author and so had characters who were more fleshed out and stories of the same nature.  This movie adapted from the book was in need of a mini-series to properly do it justice.
