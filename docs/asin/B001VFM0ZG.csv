1243579,A20CSFERC3VINT,B001VFM0ZG,"80s fan ""Adam""","[2, 5]",I like Family Guy but lately they have not been doing much with Meg and Chris. The only main episode with Chris in it was Long John Peter. Meg does not have much of a part in these episodes. By the way why does the product say season 7 part 2 and season 8 part 1? It should really say season 6 part 2 and season 7 part 1. Oh well its not that important.I hope volume 8 comes out in less than a year. Also the deleted scenes were horrible. The other volumes had at least 10 good ones but this one had awful ones. I also hated The Juice is Loose. What a bad idea for the last episode on this volume. So if you don't mind all this stuff buy the volume. If you do mind you should buy it anyway that's what I did and I guess I'm glad I got it.,4,Good but not enough Meg,1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,738,"['like', 'Family', 'Guy', 'lately', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'doing', 'much', 'Meg', 'Chris', 'only', 'main', 'episode', 'Chris', 'was', 'Long', 'John', 'Peter', 'Meg', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'part', 'episodes', 'way', 'why', 'product', 'say', 'season', '7', 'part', '2', 'season', '8', 'part', '1', 'should', 'really', 'say', 'season', '6', 'part', '2', 'season', '7', 'part', '1', 'Oh', 'well', 'not', 'important.I', 'hope', 'volume', '8', 'out', 'less', 'year', 'Also', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'horrible', 'other', 'volumes', 'had', 'least', '10', 'good', 'ones', 'one', 'had', 'awful', 'ones', 'also', 'hated', 'Juice', 'Loose', 'What', 'bad', 'idea', 'last', 'episode', 'volume', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'stuff', 'buy', 'volume', 'do', 'mind', 'should', 'buy', 'anyway', 'what', 'did', 'guess', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got']",N/A

This is just not a funny show to me anymore.  While I was the first one to scream and shout in total excitement when Fox decided to bring back Family Guy a few years ago, since then the quality has dropped dramatically to the point where you just KNOW the writers are milking the series as much as they possibly can.With that said, the show does its job making me laugh when I watch an episode the very first time, and the second time around I like to be reminded of some of the better jokes, but actually buying a DVD seasons worth of mediocre episodes where you are fortunate enough to see ONE good episode but having to sit through two BAD episodes in a row in order to get to the good one, and the hit or miss pattern remains like that for the entire season?

Now you only recieve the inside cover. I purchased this somewhere else so I could get the slip cover because I like mine to match.THIS SET:As Fox Home Video has done with all shows they release on DVD, this one is a thin DVD cover with cheap plastic.For the first few months you would recieve the same cheap DVD case, but with a cardboard slip cover with the Griffins on it. The slip cover really help it match the others when on a shelf. The front (with slip cover) is a picture of the Griffins outside their house with the door cracked open. Through a small plastic window you can see the inside cover which appears as you're looking into the house (I find that cool). On the Back you get Joe and Quaqmire as they looked in the ""Jackass"" spoof they did, and you get a description of the DVD with inside special features. When you take the slip cover off (which this is the one you now recieve) You get to see the whole picture inside the house. Where there seems to be a wreck of things happening. Many of the Family Guy Universe Characters on this cover all appear in at least one episode in this Volume, which is very neat.Inside the case, you get all three discs in a cheap holder, like a regular 2-Disc DVD set but with a 2 sided wing. There are three pictures under each disc description (which is just episode titles). All features are on disc 3, just like all Volume sets that have been released.The set is the first ""Uncensored"" DVD set. It just has more language per episode. Volumes 3-6 also had uncensored features, but volume seven is the first to be dubbed uncensored.FINAL THOUGHTS:If you already have the boxed set version of volumes 1-6, I would suggest trying to find this volume with the slip cover like from [...].

1243605,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B001VFM0ZG,Jiang Xueqin,"[4, 6]","""Family Guy"" has many antecedents and ancestors.  There are the obvious similarities to the absurdity and wierdness of ""The Simpsons,"" ""South Park,"" and ""Seinfeld.""  But even these shows had narrative arcs and consistency of characters that made watching them a startling and striking but not disconnecting and alienating experience.  There is nothing to hold ""Family Guy"" together, and the show's in a constant state of flux and instability.  What can you say about a show in which a dog can write his own novel and matriculate at Brown and a baby can build his own time machine and take over the world but the two combined cannot flush a toilet?There's no doubt that the team behind ""Family Guy"" are geniuses, far funnier, wittier, and smarter than the ""Saturday Night Live"" writers.  The show's creater Seth MacFarlane voices the three main characters -- Peter, Brian, and Stewie Griffith -- so that some episodes it's literally him just talking to himself.  The team of writers have collectively watched and memorized all the popular culture of the past fifty years, including movies, books (there's even a reference to Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" in one of the episodes), video games, and news.  There are some episodes which are just incredibly funny to watch, and they will skirt off randomly in different directions before coming back together again (one such episode is where Brian lobbies to legalize marijuana).But it's also clear that ""Family Guy"" is firmly wedded to the present -- you need to be living today in America in order to find the show funny.  It's instant gratification at its most extreme, and because there lacks a narrative arc it's hard to remember the episodes (although some jokes are truly memorable).  In many ways, this is not post-modern humor (the self-referential irony, the pointlessness, the contradictions, the absurdity of it all) at its most extreme -- it's post-modern humor that's just fallen off the cliff.""Family Guy"" can be at times an exhilarating experience, but most of the time it's just dizzying and disorienting.",4,Post-Modern Humor at its Zenith,1277769600,"06 29, 2010",2010,2069,"['Family', 'Guy', 'many', 'antecedents', 'ancestors', 'are', 'obvious', 'similarities', 'absurdity', 'wierdness', 'Simpsons', 'South', 'Park', 'Seinfeld', 'even', 'shows', 'had', 'narrative', 'arcs', 'consistency', 'characters', 'made', 'watching', 'startling', 'striking', 'not', 'disconnecting', 'alienating', 'experience', 'nothing', 'hold', 'Family', 'Guy', 'together', 'show', 'constant', 'state', 'flux', 'instability', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'show', 'dog', 'can', 'write', 'own', 'novel', 'matriculate', 'Brown', 'baby', 'can', 'build', 'own', 'time', 'machine', 'take', 'world', 'two', 'combined', 'can', 'not', 'flush', 'toilet', 'doubt', 'team', 'Family', 'Guy', 'are', 'geniuses', 'far', 'funnier', 'wittier', 'smarter', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'writers', 'show', 'creater', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Peter', 'Brian', 'Stewie', 'Griffith', 'episodes', 'literally', 'just', 'talking', 'team', 'writers', 'have', 'collectively', 'watched', 'memorized', 'popular', 'culture', 'past', 'fifty', 'years', 'including', 'movies', 'books', 'even', 'reference', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'Fahrenheit', '451', 'one', 'episodes', 'video', 'games', 'news', 'are', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'watch', 'will', 'skirt', 'off', 'randomly', 'different', 'directions', 'coming', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'one', 'such', 'episode', 'where', 'Brian', 'lobbies', 'legalize', 'marijuana', 'also', 'clear', 'Family', 'Guy', 'firmly', 'wedded', 'present', 'need', 'be', 'living', 'today', 'America', 'order', 'find', 'show', 'funny', 'instant', 'gratification', 'most', 'extreme', 'narrative', 'arc', 'hard', 'remember', 'episodes', 'jokes', 'are', 'truly', 'memorable', 'many', 'ways', 'not', 'post-modern', 'humor', 'self-referential', 'irony', 'pointlessness', 'contradictions', 'absurdity', 'most', 'extreme', 'post-modern', 'humor', 'just', 'fallen', 'off', 'cliff', 'Family', 'Guy', 'can', 'be', 'times', 'exhilarating', 'experience', 'most', 'time', 'just', 'dizzying', 'disorienting']",N/A

The one saving grace is that there are a lot of episodes featuring Brian who is my favorite FG character.  For those who don't like Brian, this volume will probably have little to offer except for a sneak peek of the new series The Cleveland Show at the beginning of disc 2.  The best eps in this volume are ""Play It Again, Brian,"" ""Baby Not On Board,"" ""The Man With Two Brians,"" and ""Family Gay.""  There are four or five really bad ones on here as well, though.Disc 1:""Back to the Woods""--Peter loses his wallet at a Barry Manilow concert and his credit card--as well as his identity and home--is stolen by James Woods.  What is the animation fascination with James Woods (The Simpsons and Family Guy twice)?  Terrible episode with same ending with the overused crate in the warehouse scene.  Highlight: Brian chasing the squirrel around the pole.""Play It Again, Brian""--Brian wins an essay contest and is invited to Martha's Vineyard for the awards ceremony where he tries to take advantage of Peter's lack of consideration to make his intentions known to Lois.  Hilarious.  Peter's note about watching Three's Company and the look on Herbert's face as he's being scrubbed in the bathtub by Meg brought tears to my eyes.""The Former Life of Brian""--When Brian contacts an old girlfriend he finds out he fathered a son who is now a teenaged hoodlum.  When they discover they have something in common (well, weed), Brian accepts his son and turns his life around.""Long John Peter""--Peter steals a parrot from the vet and plays pirate.  Meanwhile, Chris falls for the vet's receptionist but gets bad advice from Peter.  I like how he hits Brian with a chair to get an excuse to see her.""Love Blactually""--Brian finds the perfect girl but Stewie convinces him to go slow and she ends up cheating on him with Cleveland.Disc 2:""I Dream of Jesus""--Yikes!  Maybe the worst FG ever (at least bottom 5).  Peter's obsession with ""Surfin' Bird"" drives the family (and probably most of the viewers) crazy.  Oh, and Jesus makes a comeback.""Road to Germany""--Almost as bad as the previous episode.  Mort walks into Stewie's time machine and ends up in Poland right before the Nazis invade.  Stewie and Brian follow him to bring him back to the present.""Baby Not On Board""--The Griffins go on a road trip and inadvertently leave Stewie home alone.  A lot of good lines and moments in this one.""The Man With Two Brians""--A Jack*ss stunt exposes Brian's age so Peter gets a new dog who the family loves, except Stewie.  Another good one.""Tales of a Third Grade Nothing""--Peter stumbles upon the executive washroom and is motivated to get promoted but must complete the third grade first to qualify (uh....yeah).  Meanwhile, Brian and Frank Sinatra Jr. buy the Cabana Club and Stewie turns it into the coolest club in Quahog.

While I'm not a Bushbot, I don't think that some of the content of the episodes have any buisness airing on prime time.  Some of it is just baseline and crass and that's the good stuff.I don't want to give too many examples as I don't want to ruin the episodes for people who havn't seen them.

1243615,A1MZW5Z6RFSIZI,B001VFM0ZG,"Old School Gamer ""What the hell's a gigawatt!?!""","[2, 8]","I'm with Seth on this folks, sorry. I watch the first 2-3 seasons of this show and it pales in comparison to the hilarity that has come since the show was renewed from cancelation. This season is as far out there as Family Guy has ever been and it makes for some truelly great moments. ""Family Gay"" alone is worth it(also one of the 3 episodes that finally got this show it's well-deserved Emmy nod). I payed just under $20 for this set, which to me is well worth it. I watch this show constantly while I'm doing whatever it is I do so I get my money back within a two weeks. Also, I was never one to listen to commentaries until recently, but if any show gives you great and hilarious commentary, it's this show. They offer you one for pretty much every episode as well, which should show to the nay-sayers out there that Seth is commited to giving you a consistent and worthwhile package. Not only that, everyone seems to be willing to pay $15-25 for dvd's and blu-rays of movies that only last 2 hours and offer even less of a return if you don't watch them constantly. I think people are simply expecting way too much from Fox.My favirote part of the show at this point, unlike so many, is their proclivity to recycle material as a sort of call out to longtime fans. Things like the emperor in the sinatra episode, or Buzz Killington, or the third iterance of Cleveland poor house being destroyed while he's in the tub are made that much more hilarious thanks to the repetitive nature. They always slightly adjust the jokes to make them fresh, but I see it as a gift for fans since the show started, as opposed to a slap in the face. My favirote episode may be the WWII time travel episode though, not for the humor, but simply because it really is incredible animation and musical score put to work on television. There is something amazing about the effect to me and I watch anime that destroys anything of this type. Seth and his team show real pride in their work.Like Seth said of all the complaints for the show later, everyone wants to complain about how ""awful and unfunny"" the show has become, but none of you are turning off your tv sets each sunday night.

I found several flaws:- The fact that there are only 13 episodes included in this set should not really come as a surprise to anyone as this has been the procedure for the last couple of volumes. Still, for this amount I believe the price should be lower.- As far as the content goes, I miss the dynamic of the dysfunctional but lovable Griffin family. In Volume 7, too much emphasis is put on one-liners and Brian's story lines in particular. There is not much of a plot in any of the episodes here. If you were to compare a random episode out of this volume to one of the older ones, you would surely notice a decline in quality and character development.- To go off on what previous reviewers have already pointed out, Family Guy has crossed the line of decency by now.  Many of their jokes are offensive and demeaning even for someone with an open sense of humor, such as myself.  I also did not appreciate the abundant drug references because it is sending an inappropriate message.- Finally, I am not fond of the new packaging.
