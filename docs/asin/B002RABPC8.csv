Then he screams in the microphone about stuff that is NOT funny. I suffered through the entirte DVD waiting for it to get funny and it never did. He screams alot, and then screams more. It's very annoying. It's more like a commentary about how great he thinks he is. I can't for the life of me figure out how this guy got famous. Oh, did I mention that he screams his material for the entire performance, most of the time about how great he thinks he is?",1,Brutally bad,1269475200,"03 25, 2010",2010,521,"['not', 'funny', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'Spanish', 'Then', 'microphone', 'stuff', 'NOT', 'funny', 'suffered', 'entirte', 'DVD', 'waiting', 'get', 'funny', 'never', 'did', 'alot', 'then', 'screams', 'more', 'very', 'annoying', 'more', 'commentary', 'how', 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'guy', 'got', 'famous', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'material', 'entire', 'performance', 'most', 'time', 'how', 'great']","George Lopez: Tall, Dark & Chicano"
1285156,A2N24HQBUH7R2L,B002RABPC8,"Paul Andrew Haried ""Jewish Native American""","[13, 19]","George Lopez: Tall, Dark & Chicanoi watched George Lopez new stand up comedy on HBO which was live in La Vernia, Texas. His Comedy is fantastic. Grant it his comedy has bad langauge in it and can get really gritty about the subjects he talks about, however he gets everyone laughing with his comedy. he makes fun of his own culture, makes fun of white americans, makes fun of his family too and the situations that he has been through in his life. he really got me laughing when he made fun of Lee Greenwood's Song Proud To Be An American the republican party's national anthem. if you like stand up comedy with grit and colorful language as Spock mentioned in several star trek movies, then this dvd is for you.  the reason i rate this movie 5 stars is George Lopez is entertaining and funny. also i rated this movie 5 stars because George is flawless in his physical and verbal humour.  George Lopez: Tall Dark & Chicano is his best stand up comedy so far, and now he has his own late night show on tbs. i laughed throughout the whole show on HBO.  Anyone that can get me laughing deserves a great rating.  la Siempre Chicano America.",5,Talk Dark & Chicano,1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,1136,"['George', 'Lopez', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Chicanoi', 'watched', 'George', 'Lopez', 'new', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'HBO', 'was', 'live', 'La', 'Vernia', 'Texas', 'Comedy', 'fantastic', 'Grant', 'comedy', 'bad', 'langauge', 'can', 'get', 'really', 'gritty', 'subjects', 'however', 'everyone', 'laughing', 'comedy', 'fun', 'own', 'culture', 'fun', 'white', 'americans', 'fun', 'family', 'too', 'situations', 'been', 'life', 'really', 'got', 'laughing', 'when', 'made', 'fun', 'Lee', 'Greenwood', 'Song', 'Proud', 'Be', 'American', 'republican', 'party', 'national', 'anthem', 'like', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'grit', 'colorful', 'language', 'Spock', 'mentioned', 'several', 'star', 'trek', 'movies', 'then', 'dvd', 'reason', 'i', 'rate', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'George', 'Lopez', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'also', 'i', 'rated', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'George', 'flawless', 'physical', 'verbal', 'humour', 'George', 'Lopez', 'Tall', 'Dark', 'Chicano', 'best', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'so', 'far', 'now', 'own', 'late', 'night', 'show', 'tbs', 'i', 'laughed', 'whole', 'show', 'HBO', 'Anyone', 'can', 'get', 'laughing', 'great', 'rating', 'Siempre', 'Chicano', 'America']","George Lopez: Tall, Dark & Chicano"
