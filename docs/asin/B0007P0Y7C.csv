I don't know how closely the plot might follow the comic books (apparently even they have changed over time)but I found that watching Jennifer Garner was the best part of it, she did very well as her character. The action scenes were interesting but there was a lot of talk and flashback stuff that just dragged it down for me.Elektra's abandoned childhood home, I noticed that it still had electricity and the gas was on in the kitchen, that looked like a flaw to me.

885712,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0007P0Y7C,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 0]","If there was an award handed out to the film with the most wasted potential, there would be several winners this year, but one of the runners up would be the film Elektra.  While there were some decent action sequences coupled with some very impressive villains, it was ultimately the unrealistic story and constantly changing characters that will leave your head lost in the clouds.  Throughout the film, Garner's character of Elektra is never defined.  As often as the scenery changes in this film, as does Garner's portrayal of Elektra.  One moment she is this heartless killer, and within a few short minutes, she is the most compassionate creature to be released by the comics.  It literally made no sense.  Who was she?  What was her true purpose?  Why (this is always a good question)?  Was she looking for compassion and love?  I have no clue, and this film took no effort to disclose the truth.  Instead, we are forced to jump back and forth trying to decipher these basic elements that were never covered in this film.  Couple with this some evil villains that were aesthetically pleasing to the eye, but that is all and you have the butchered comic release of Elektra.My initial thought about this film was that director Rob Bowman didn't do enough research on this character to correctly bring her to life.  I have personally never read any of the comics, but I did see the film Daredevil, and I must admit Garner did provide the perfect opportunity to avoid looking at Ben Affleck, and I must say that I was interested in seeing how she was going to expand her character.  Let me tell you how she did it ... she took away any boundaries and borders.  Garner created this character that floated through each scene without creating any substance.  At one point she would be ruthless, then mere seconds later, Garner would show some sympathy towards one of the characters that would surpassingly seem out of character, because instantly she would transform back.  There was no definition with her Elektra, which allowed for confusion and miscommunication to those involved in watching this film.  Perhaps Garner wasn't quite comfortable in this role, or maybe the writing just didn't allow her to fully define herself.  Whatever it was it transformed Garner from this encrypted character to just a fumbled mess of thoughts.With this said, one can also complain that this problem also occurred with the villains of this film.  I was so excited to finally see colorful and purely evil villains, that my excitement slowly died upon witnessing nothing happening with them.  There was no story, there was no moment of evil, there was nothing except a short glance of their faces followed by no lines coupled with impending death.  These guys were tough, and they had some superhero powers that Garner didn't even acknowledge.  It was yet again another glowing example of Rob Bowman not following through with the image of the comics and giving us ""dead"" characters.  After witnessing the ""flip-floppery"" of Elektra, I wasn't expecting it from the villains, but somehow they just appeared.  It then became apparent what Bowman had done wrong.  His focus was not on Elektra or her arch-nemesis, but instead of the graphics that were being created.  The story was weak, and I think Bowman knew that, so he spent a majority of his money on the CGI aspects of the film.  Which, strangely, worked.I must give this film some credit, and that would be solely to the special effects crew.  I thought visually this film was entertainment, but when you opened your ears, the remaining element just forced this film to crash and burn.  Bowman knew how to make a visually appealing film, and he succeeded, but if he could have continued to add a very exciting and unfaltering story line, then he would have had a masterpiece.  Instead, we are left with a horrible portrayal of Elektra by Garner, coupled with the cheesy Terrence Stamp moments that seem to all-so-well accompany the weakest, yet visually stunning, baddies this world has ever seen.  It was just a hodge-podge of troubles, and at the helm was director Rob Bowman.Overall, I wasn't impressed at all.  There were moments during this film where I thought it was going to go to a whole new level, but instead it just created a double negative effect.  In essence, the ""fun"" scenes were cancelled out by less important, nearly muted scenes.  Garner tried, but ultimately failed as this superhero.  She had the potential to really take this character to new levels, but thanks to the backward mind of Rob Bowman, she was unsuccessful.  I truly believe that the focus in this feature was pointed in the wrong direction, do not give us the best camera shot known to man, but instead powerful characters and a believable (and less Hollywood) plot.  This will give us a stronger character in the long run.  The largest disappointment to this film was the characters that felt as if they were forgotten about.  While I will never say that Daredevil was a better picture, but there are plenty of comic book films that do a better job of bringing their images to life.  Skip this one and go see Sin City.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Don't worry.

885715,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B0007P0Y7C,Amanda Richards,"[35, 40]","For pure entertainment value, I thought this was a great movie.  Good vs. Evil, female superhero with hot red costume, villains with magical powers, martial arts action, dreamy fight scenes a la ""Hero"" and a valuable treasure to be protected.On the surface, this movie swept me away with its action sequences and special effects, but then I got to thinking, and that kind of spoiled it for me.Elektra (Jennifer Garner) at the beginning of the movie was the coolest thing in red ever.  She was like Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss) from the first Matrix movie, unstoppable, inhuman, focused and deadly, plus she looked darned good in that outfit with her hair swinging around.As the story goes, suffering from a bit of burnout, she accepts one more assignment, and then suddenly has a change of heart when she receives her hit list.  From here on, the writers strip away her intrigue and mystique, and it was disappointing to see a superhero suffer from OCD and insomnia, depend on an agent instead of a trusty butler, and generally get less and less super and more and more vulnerable.  She doesn't even don the red body hugger again until the end of the movie.The bad guys then begin pursuing her new acquaintances, and she assumes a bodyguard role without even asking why one man and his daughter would be worth the effort.  After a lot of ta-da, she ends up back at the training camp of her sensei, who although blind like all good mentors, is not an inscrutable Asian with a long moustache, but a cranky white dude named Stick (Terrence Stamp).This brings us to the best part of the movie, with a group of villains with real superpowers, who of course choose to attack one by one so that the good guys can save the day. Kirigi (Will Yun Lee) is a real martial artist, and two-sworded leader of the bunch; Typhoid (Natassia Malthe) can kill with a touch, and she almost sucks the life out of Elektra with a lingering kiss; Stone (Bob Sapp) is like The Thing, skin like armor and built like a barn; Kinkou (Edson Ribeiro) comes and goes quickly, and Tattoo (Chris Ackerman) is by far the most magical, with body tattoos with lives of their own.  These guys make the movie worth watching, and it's really sad to see them go.Kirsten Prout handles herself very well as Abby Miller, the young girl that looks up to Elektra, and has a secret of her own, but Goran Visnjic doesn't have the satisfaction of a solid role to stand on.Enjoy this one for the action, but don't pause to think about the plot.On the side of goodElektra wields a mean saiTo save the treasureAmanda Richards, July 24, 2005",4,Hero in a tight red suit,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,2585,"['pure', 'entertainment', 'value', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'Good', 'vs', 'Evil', 'female', 'superhero', 'hot', 'red', 'costume', 'magical', 'powers', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'dreamy', 'fight', 'scenes', 'la', 'Hero', 'valuable', 'treasure', 'be', 'protected.On', 'surface', 'movie', 'swept', 'away', 'action', 'sequences', 'special', 'effects', 'then', 'got', 'thinking', 'kind', 'spoiled', 'me.Elektra', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'coolest', 'thing', 'red', 'ever', 'was', 'like', 'Trinity', 'Carrie', 'Ann', 'Moss', 'first', 'Matrix', 'movie', 'unstoppable', 'inhuman', 'focused', 'deadly', 'looked', 'darned', 'good', 'outfit', 'hair', 'swinging', 'story', 'suffering', 'bit', 'burnout', 'one', 'more', 'assignment', 'then', 'suddenly', 'change', 'heart', 'when', 'hit', 'list', 'here', 'writers', 'strip', 'away', 'intrigue', 'mystique', 'was', 'disappointing', 'see', 'superhero', 'suffer', 'OCD', 'insomnia', 'depend', 'agent', 'instead', 'trusty', 'butler', 'generally', 'get', 'less', 'less', 'super', 'more', 'more', 'vulnerable', ""n't"", 'even', 'don', 'red', 'body', 'hugger', 'again', 'end', 'movie.The', 'bad', 'guys', 'then', 'begin', 'pursuing', 'new', 'acquaintances', 'bodyguard', 'role', 'even', 'asking', 'why', 'one', 'man', 'daughter', 'would', 'be', 'effort', 'lot', 'ta-da', 'up', 'back', 'training', 'camp', 'sensei', 'who', 'blind', 'good', 'mentors', 'not', 'inscrutable', 'Asian', 'long', 'moustache', 'cranky', 'white', 'dude', 'named', 'Stick', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', '.This', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'group', 'villains', 'real', 'superpowers', 'who', 'course', 'choose', 'attack', 'one', 'one', 'so', 'good', 'guys', 'can', 'save', 'day', 'Kirigi', 'Will', 'Yun', 'Lee', 'real', 'martial', 'artist', 'two-sworded', 'leader', 'bunch', 'Typhoid', 'Natassia', 'Malthe', 'can', 'kill', 'touch', 'almost', 'life', 'Elektra', 'lingering', 'kiss', 'Stone', 'Bob', 'Sapp', 'Thing', 'skin', 'armor', 'built', 'barn', 'Kinkou', 'Edson', 'Ribeiro', 'quickly', 'Tattoo', 'Chris', 'Ackerman', 'far', 'most', 'magical', 'body', 'tattoos', 'lives', 'own', 'guys', 'make', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'really', 'sad', 'see', 'go.Kirsten', 'Prout', 'very', 'well', 'Abby', 'Miller', 'young', 'girl', 'up', 'Elektra', 'secret', 'own', 'Goran', 'Visnjic', ""n't"", 'have', 'satisfaction', 'solid', 'role', 'stand', 'on.Enjoy', 'one', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'pause', 'think', 'plot.On', 'side', 'goodElektra', 'wields', 'mean', 'saiTo', 'save', 'treasureAmanda', 'Richards', 'July', '24', '2005']",N/A

After stealing the spotlight from Ben Affleck in Daredevil people saw that Jenifer Garner definetly should have her own Elektra movie. I was very eager to see this movie and I myself admit it was quite good. Some old fashioned action scenes, and it reminded me alot of the old days. But what really brought this film to its peak were the villains. They were very well done and creative, technically I was becomming more obsessed with the villains then with Elektra herself. However the enjoyment of the villains ends too soon viewing Elektra an almighty being cannot be killed so with a simple throw of her dagger she can kill all the villains.

I watched the revised film and it honestly felt just like the first version. The changes weren't drastic. There are some extended and reimagined scenes.

And I would've taken the opportunity to cut out some uncessary scenes like that pathetic fleeting romance fling between Mark Miller and Elektra. On the plus, the new scenes do improve the quality of the film. Check out the enhanced ""kimigure"" scenes and a nice extended scene at The Hand's headquarters. It's also not the gorefest that some people rumored it would be. It's just as bloodless as the original version. Overall, this director's cut version is a good improvement over the original version.I have not seen the special features yet but the fact that it's on a seperate disk means that there are bigger and better documentaries than on the original DVD release.

That's as close as this movie gets to real life.  As I recall, 'Daredevil' in his red leather outfit donned his disguise to help mankind in his mission to avenge his father's death. In this production of Regency Pictures using Marvel Comics, the female protagonist in her skimpy red outfit is a high paid killer with an analytical mind who seeks to avenge the murder of her mother. Thus, the tables are turned.In this allegory of the ancient war between good and evil, he chose the good, she the evil. She was told by her teacher, a member of the group HAND, that some lessons can't be taught; you must live them to be understood. He is convinced that she is poisoned by hate but has a 'pure' heart.  Terence Stamp made a good leader named aptly 'Stick' who is a holdover from ""Daredevil' where he taught the hero how to fight. Here, he does the same for Elektra and later young Abby Miller.  Mark Miller was played by Goran Visnjic of ER fame, a dead-ringer for the young, handsome Robert Downey, Jr., whose star has faded. He was the only character seemingly human. His daugher, 13-yr-old Abby, has a criminal mind and believes the adage that nobody tells the truth about themselves.All humans make mistakes, but these demonic comic-book characters were not human. I have the theory that this movie is not totally fantasy: there are such demons among us in plain sight.  Apparently raised from the dead in 'Daredevil,' she does the same for Abby. She had become emotionally involved with Mark and saw in rebellious Abby the 'young girl she once was.' She knew firsthand that life was not always going to be a bowl of cherries, nor would it turn out to be a bowl of sour grapes either.There are some unusual special effects, and the machinegun violence and weird confrontations were a little much. Tatoo was all snakes, just one of the demonic assassins sent by the Council of the HAND to finish the job Elekta chose not to do and find the 'treasure.' He almost demolished what he was sent to do.  Location shots at a monastery (indoor and outdoors) were lavish. Everything was foreign to me, since I've never read this genre of comic books (I debate the connotation 'comic' in this type of violent illustrated media.) and I was shaken to the core. The director did his job well, as did the actors, but I doubt I will attend this type of production again. To me, comic means something to make you laugh and feel good.

She works as an assassin, going from one mission to another.She is sent to a lake house to kill father/daughter Mark (Goran Visnjic) and Abby (Kirsten Prout) Miller. Not knowing they are her victims at first, the young Abby begins to bond with Elektra. After a Christmas dinner against her will with both father and daughter, Elektra begins to come out of her shell. She learns that Mark is a widower, and that his wife was previously killed by a drunk driver. Of course she relates to Abby, after losing her mother at an early age also.Afterwards, Elektra finds out that Mark and Abby are her next assignment, and that a group of highly skilled and mystical vigilantes called ""The Order of the Hand"" are the ones who put the hit on the Millers. Elektra tries to kill the Millers, but alas, she just can't seem to do it.So she does the next best thing: she joins forces with them and decides to fight against the ""Hand"", whose members all have special abilities of there own (which for the most part are pretty cool)Along the way ""Elektra"" realizes that the Millers' aren't exactly who they claim to be. This reviewer won't disclose who the Millers' are but will say that once they are revealed, that is when the movie ""Elektra"" really becomes some sort of Spy Kids/Wonder Woman/Wonder Girl kind of soap opera.All in all Elektra isn't a horrible movie; it's just not a great one either. It suffers from some pretty long stretches throughout. It also fluctuates on being a film made for adults and then for kids; but never really finds it's footing with either audience. Essentially, the film ends up feeling as though it was made for teenage girls.Having never read the Elektra comic book character, I am not sure how closely the comic interpretation of Elektra matches the film. The one thing I am positive of is that Jennifer Garner looks better than ever in the red costume she wears, and she can definitely hold a film together; especially when there's not much of anything else to grab on to.",3,Not very Elektrafying,1117670400,"06 2, 2005",2005,2398,"['O.K', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', '30-40', 'minutes', 'Elektra', 'wrong', 'turn', 'sort', 'teenage', 'girl', 'super', 'hero', 'fantasy.Elektra', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'was', 'killed', 'movie', 'Daredevil', 'apparently', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'kind', 'Zen', 'master', 'using', 'mystical', 'force', 'called', 'Kimagure', 'see', 'future', 'limited', 'amount', 'time', 'assassin', 'going', 'one', 'mission', 'another.She', 'sent', 'lake', 'house', 'kill', 'father/daughter', 'Mark', 'Goran', 'Visnjic', 'Abby', 'Kirsten', 'Prout', 'Miller', 'Not', 'knowing', 'are', 'victims', 'first', 'young', 'Abby', 'bond', 'Elektra', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'will', 'father', 'daughter', 'Elektra', 'come', 'shell', 'Mark', 'widower', 'wife', 'was', 'previously', 'killed', 'drunk', 'driver', 'course', 'Abby', 'losing', 'mother', 'early', 'age', 'also.Afterwards', 'Elektra', 'out', 'Mark', 'Abby', 'are', 'next', 'assignment', 'group', 'highly', 'skilled', 'mystical', 'vigilantes', 'called', 'Order', 'Hand', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'put', 'hit', 'Millers', 'Elektra', 'kill', 'Millers', 'alas', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'it.So', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'forces', 'fight', 'Hand', 'members', 'have', 'special', 'abilities', 'own', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'way', 'Elektra', 'Millers', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'who', 'claim', 'be', 'reviewer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disclose', 'who', 'Millers', 'are', 'will', 'say', 'once', 'are', 'revealed', 'when', 'movie', 'Elektra', 'really', 'sort', 'Spy', 'Kids/Wonder', 'Woman/Wonder', 'Girl', 'kind', 'soap', 'opera.All', 'Elektra', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'pretty', 'long', 'stretches', 'also', 'being', 'film', 'made', 'adults', 'then', 'kids', 'never', 'really', 'footing', 'audience', 'Essentially', 'film', 'up', 'feeling', 'was', 'made', 'teenage', 'girls.Having', 'never', 'read', 'Elektra', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'closely', 'comic', 'interpretation', 'Elektra', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'am', 'positive', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'better', 'ever', 'red', 'costume', 'can', 'definitely', 'hold', 'film', 'together', 'especially', 'when', 'not', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'grab']",N/A

When I saw the trailers for the spinoff, Elektra, it threw me off because of the characters' abilities in the trailer.  That's one of the reasons I decided to not go see it.  After renting the movie, I'm sad that I didn't give the movie more of a box-office look.Jennifer Garner returns as Elektra, who was untimely slayed in Daredevil. Being brought back to life, she now has become an assassin for hire and a lot colder as the result of the events in her life.  She almost shows no point of return up until she decides not to kill the new targets. Jennifer Garner did a great job playing this character.  She seemed to really be into it. The action sequences are great, one of which Garner suffered a pretty nasty injury in.  It reminded me of Daredevil, but it had an X-Men flavor to it.  Whereas the villains of Daredevil were more realistic, the villains in Elektra are more fantastical as far as abilities. But they made sense because of the storyline presented in the movie.They left the movie open for a sequel, but I doubt it will given its box office gross.  The only hope it has is a big DVD/VHS account, or that a Daredevil 2 happens.  God knows Ben Affleck could use a big movie right now.  Jennifer Garner however has been undamaged by this movie.

885744,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0007P0Y7C,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[5, 6]","Something to chew on...in Greek mythology Electra was the daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon who, with her brother Orestes, avenged the murder of Agamemnon by killing their mother and her lover, Aegisthus.  In terms of the comic book (or graphic novel, whichever you prefer) and the 2003 film Daredevil, Elektra (slightly different spelling) was a character who started studying martial arts at an early age, lost her mother much sooner than she should have, and began using her skills to become one of the world's deadliest assassins....in a nutshell (it's been a great while since I've read the comics, so this comes more from the film).  Directed by Rob Bowman (The X Files, Reign of Fire), the film stars Jennifer Garner from the popular television show `Alias'.  Also appearing is Goran Visnjic (Dr. Luka Kovac on `ER""), Kirsten Prout (The Love Crimes of Gillian Guess), Will Yun Lee (Die Another Day, Torque), Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Licence to Kill, Mortal Kombat), and Terence Stamp, whom many may recognize from any number of films including Young Guns, Alien Nation, and The Limey, but I'll always know him as the ruthless General Zod from the Superman movies...'Come to me, son of Jor-El! Kneel before Zod!'The film begins by relating a whole bunch of stuff including how there are two organizations, Kimagure (good) and The Hand (bad), vying for the same thing in that of some sort of treasure that would ultimately shift the power balance one way or another (The Hand is interested in it for world domination purposes and stuff like that while the Kimagure are content with having it if only to keep it away from The Hand).  We also learn Elektra (Garner), who died the last time we saw her in the film Daredevil, has been brought back to life by her once martial arts Stick (Stamp), and has now become an assassin for hire, with her skills in high demand.  After taking on a lucrative contract, she discovers something within herself lost since thought lost, and can't follow through.  Not only that, but soon she finds herself in the position of protector, perhaps as an effort of redemption, as those who took out the original contract have since decided to bring in some big guns to finish the job in a team of deadly killers each with their own, unique power.In terms of a movie based on a comic book character, I enjoyed Elektra, but that's not to say it didn't have some flaws.  I think the thing I was most impressed with was how the film looked overall, filled with stunning, rich, vibrant, and beautiful visuals.  Also, I thought the action very well done, the fight scenes sharp and exciting, and Garner sure looked good in that red outfit.  There were a few things about the film I didn't like...I thought the action through most of the film somewhat sporadic, loaded towards the latter half of the film.  Also, the actions scenes often seemed short and less comprehensive than I would have thought.  At some point in the movie we're presented with a fearsome group of killers in Stone (in RPGs he/she would be classified as a `brick', or a character whose size and strength usually dictate his/her actions), Typhoid, whose touch is death, Tattoo, who can bring to life the various deadly creatures inked onto his body, Kinkou, whose ability seems to be limited to being able to balance really well (what's the point?  When special powers were being handed out, this guy missed the boat), and Kirigi, their leader, master of marital arts.  They seem like a very formidable group and are feared by even those they work for, but they're quashed with relative ease at various points in the film.  And here's something else that disappointed me...near the end we're set for a huge battle, one chock full of ninjas, but then all the ninjas get popped as they're caught trying to enter through the same area, in one stupid bunch, and Elektra makes short work of them, barely lifting a finger in doing so...I thought the real `final' battle pretty good, but I found the inclusion of the swirling sheets rather annoying.  The dialog was pretty predictable, but maybe that's because I've read so many comic books when I was younger...and the character of Elektra...I thought Garner did very well, but maybe it was just the way it was written as I felt it never quite made it from what I remember from so long ago in that of an extremely serious character, focused and determined, not easily swayed by emotions or sentiment.  Ultimately the story is kinda weak (I never got the sense this was the `ultimate' battle between good and evil, and the `treasure' was really worth all the trouble), and not really deserving, but it was fun if you're not expecting too much, and if a sequel is made, I'll see it...The anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) picture on this DVD looks excellent, and the audio, available in English (DTS 5.1) and English (Dolby Digital 5.1) is just as good.  There are a number of special features including a `making of' and Inside the Editing room' featurettes, a bit Garner filmed for some Comic-Con (comics convention) presentation, sneak peeks, and three deleted scenes, one featuring Ben Affleck as Matt Murdoch aka Daredevil.  Can anyone tell me what is the deal with some companies using cardboard slipcases over the DVD case itself?  Is there a purpose for this extra packaging?  They're nice and shiny, but the one for this film featured a giant hole in the back where the UPC code once resided.  This didn't really bother me, but others might like to save this part, and might be disappointed if all are the same.  Something else that bugged me...20th Century Fox slapped on this advertising that plays once the DVD is put into a player, one against pirating films from the internet and other sources...why in the world are they advertising to those of us who bought the damn movie?  If they're so concerned about it, go after those who do it and leave the rest of us alone to enjoy the movie.Cookieman108",3,"""Don't worry, death's not that bad...""",1113091200,"04 10,

885745,A3BGMKWUXQDODF,B0007P0Y7C,Crash,"[3, 5]","Elektra is a spinoff of Daredevil, in which she is resurrected from the dead and now lives as an assasin for hire. Within the first 10 minutes, we learn that she is a cold-blooded killer with no remorse and is in it for the money. But after her next mission goes awry when she becomes attached to her targets, Abby and her fathers, things get nasty as members of The Hand themselves go after them.What really suprised me about Elektra that some superhero films lack is its emotional depth. Elektra not only faces a crisis of conscience, but we see her transformation from a killer to a warrior with a heart, which can be seen with her relationship with Abby. Also, the movie maintains a consistent dark tone throughout, and with it, creates feelings of suspense and intrigue. The action scenes are beautifully shot (the fight with Kirigi used no stunt doubles!), and the cinematography and special effects are definitely achievements worth mentioning in the comic book genre.Jennifer Garner, however, reminds us why Elektra was made: because she's so darn good in the role. Her dedication to the role is non-stop, and I think she has done an amazing job. The rest of the cast fairs well, especially Kirsten Prout, who has a bright future ahead of her based on this performance.Elektra is easy for me to recommend as it's the best movie of 2005 so far (with Sin City), and should not be missed for those looking for a worthy action thriller with a good mix of drama and suspense.",5,Elektra succeeds on all levels.,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,1478,"['Elektra', 'spinoff', 'Daredevil', 'resurrected', 'dead', 'now', 'assasin', 'hire', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'learn', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'remorse', 'money', 'next', 'mission', 'awry', 'when', 'attached', 'targets', 'Abby', 'fathers', 'things', 'get', 'nasty', 'members', 'Hand', 'go', 'really', 'suprised', 'Elektra', 'superhero', 'films', 'lack', 'emotional', 'depth', 'Elektra', 'not', 'only', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'see', 'transformation', 'killer', 'warrior', 'heart', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'relationship', 'Abby', 'Also', 'movie', 'consistent', 'dark', 'tone', 'feelings', 'suspense', 'intrigue', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'fight', 'Kirigi', 'used', 'stunt', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'definitely', 'achievements', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'comic', 'book', 'genre.Jennifer', 'Garner', 'however', 'why', 'Elektra', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'darn', 'good', 'role', 'dedication', 'role', 'non-stop', 'think', 'done', 'amazing', 'job', 'rest', 'cast', 'fairs', 'well', 'especially', 'Kirsten', 'Prout', 'who', 'bright', 'future', 'ahead', 'based', 'performance.Elektra', 'easy', 'recommend', 'best', 'movie', '2005', 'far', 'Sin', 'City', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'looking', 'worthy', 'action', 'thriller', 'good', 'mix', 'drama', 'suspense']",N/A

885748,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B0007P0Y7C,Danno,"[2, 3]","Ever since 'Spiderman' and 'X-Men' rocketed to success, Marvel Comics has rushed as many of their properties to be developed as feature films as time allows. Unfortunately for Marvel, most superheroes who are cultural icons were created by DC Comics, and so we've been treated to films about relatively obscure comic books like ""Daredevil,"" ""The Punisher,"" and now ""Elektra."" These films seem designed to fail; only comic-book geeks will recognize the names and show up on opening weekend, yet these same comic-book geeks will complain very loudly when the films deviate from the comics.I don't know how closely ""Elektra"" follows the comic-book and, quite frankly, I could care less. When ""Elektra"" works, it's due to the chemistry between Jennifer Garner as Elektra and Terrance Stamp as her blind mentor. Garner's a talented actress with a real knack for action sequences, but she needs to have a strong cast to play off. Outside of Stamp, absolutely no one provides Garner with what she needs, and so we have one meaningless action sequence after another. The villains are forgetten as soon as the film stops running, and the central conceit of the film - yet another martial arts ""chosen one"" story - is as cliched as they come. The result is a by-the-numbers action flick with occassional above-average characterizations. An average episode of ""Alias"" has better choreographed fight scenes than this movie. ""Alias"" also has far better writing, music, production values, and direction.If you're a Jennifer Garner or ""Alias"" fan and approach this movie in that light, you probably won't be badly disappointed. Just as in ""Alias,"" Garner gets to confidently strut her stuff wearing fetish outfits and prove her mettle in multiple fight scenes. Although the suits at Marvel might have hoped this would spark a new franchise, ""Elektra"" is really just a side-project for a popular television actress. Aside from Garner fans, I can't imagine why anyone would want to sit through this when so many other, better action films are out there.",3,Elektra's about as good as expected,1109462400,"02 27, 2005",2005,2036,"['Ever', ""'Spiderman"", 'X-Men', 'rocketed', 'success', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'rushed', 'many', 'properties', 'be', 'developed', 'feature', 'films', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'Marvel', 'most', 'superheroes', 'who', 'are', 'cultural', 'icons', 'were', 'created', 'DC', 'Comics', 'so', ""'ve"", 'been', 'treated', 'films', 'relatively', 'obscure', 'comic', 'books', 'Daredevil', 'Punisher', 'now', 'Elektra', 'films', 'seem', 'designed', 'fail', 'only', 'comic-book', 'geeks', 'will', 'recognize', 'names', 'show', 'up', 'opening', 'weekend', 'yet', 'same', 'comic-book', 'geeks', 'will', 'complain', 'very', 'loudly', 'when', 'films', 'deviate', 'comics.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'closely', 'Elektra', 'comic-book', 'quite', 'frankly', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'When', 'Elektra', 'due', 'chemistry', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Elektra', 'Terrance', 'Stamp', 'blind', 'mentor', 'Garner', 'talented', 'actress', 'real', 'knack', 'action', 'sequences', 'have', 'strong', 'cast', 'play', 'off', 'Stamp', 'absolutely', 'one', 'Garner', 'what', 'so', 'have', 'one', 'meaningless', 'action', 'sequence', 'villains', 'are', 'forgetten', 'as', 'soon', 'film', 'running', 'central', 'conceit', 'film', 'yet', 'martial', 'chosen', 'one', 'story', 'as', 'cliched', 'come', 'result', 'by-the-numbers', 'action', 'flick', 'occassional', 'above-average', 'characterizations', 'average', 'episode', 'Alias', 'better', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Alias', 'also', 'far', 'better', 'writing', 'music', 'production', 'values', 'direction.If', ""'re"", 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Alias', 'fan', 'approach', 'movie', 'light', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'badly', 'disappointed', 'Just', 'Alias', 'Garner', 'confidently', 'strut', 'stuff', 'wearing', 'fetish', 'outfits', 'prove', 'mettle', 'multiple', 'fight', 'scenes', 'suits', 'Marvel', 'might', 'have', 'hoped', 'would', 'spark', 'new', 'franchise', 'Elektra', 'really', 'just', 'side-project', 'popular', 'television', 'actress', 'Aside', 'Garner', 'fans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'sit', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'better', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'there']",N/A
885749,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B0007P0Y7C,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[2, 3]","I was sitting with a female friend of mine looking over a selection of DVDs to check out and we came across the latest martial arts superhero flick ""ELEKTRA."" Turning to me and pointing at the cover shot of Jennifer Garner she said to me ""Now, I'm not into girls - but she is HOT!""And that is a major draw for this movie - that and the impressive action scenes in which Garner puts her ALIAS tv show fighting chops to practice once more in a heart pounding series of set pieces.But the main attraction (acknowledged reluctantly by Garner herself in pre-release publicity) is Garners super-sexy physique, nicely accented by the skin-tight red outfit she wears in the movie.Serious and thought-provoking drama this is not - but to its credit it doesn't pretend to be. Sure there is character angst on the part of Elektra dealing with the death of her mother and the inner turmoil over being assigned to kill a young girl and her father. There is a lesbian subtext most visibly illustrated by the main female villainess giving Elektra (quite literally) the kiss of death and some character struggles on the part of the father and daughter. But for the most part the entire cast realize that this is pure popcorn fodder and act accordingly.The plot (for what it is) revolves around the title character. An assassin for hire, she is a seemingly ghost-like figure who can evade high-tech security systems to get to her prey. Then while waiting for her next assignment she befriends a precocious young girl Abby (Kirsten Prout) and her protective father (played by Goran Visnjic). Eventually the orders arrive - the targets are the two. Feeling a connection with the young girl Elektra decides to protect them and the race is on as she attempts to keep one step ahead of the mystical criminal organization known only as The Hand.Not surprisingly the actor who impressed me the most is the venerable Terence Stamp who plays Elektra's mentor Stick, also turning in a wonderful performance is the young Prout, who steals almost every scene in which she appears.Directed by Rob Bowman, who proved he could direct action well in the excellent modern-day dragon picture REIGN OF FIRE, this movie moves along at a fair clip and does not outstay its welcome. Its not high drama or a romantic comedy - it's a no nonsense action flick that will appeal to ALIAS fans and most alpha-males who appreciate suspenseful, tension filled action scenes and shots of Garner in navel-revealing outfits.The DVD includes three deleted scenes that  were ""deleted"" for good reason, a rather EPK fluff making-of documentary that includes both interviews with Bowman and Garner, a piece on Garner's time at the Comic Convention a rather nifty editing-room feature and the trailer. Hopefully one day when this movie has passed into cult-favorite status (as it is bound to become) they will get Bowman and Garner together for an audio commentary.Until that day, sit back and enjoy some straightforward, good natured Jennifer Garner fun.Blu-ray update:The video quality of the high definition Blu-ray is quite good and not surprisingly easily bests its standard def DVD counterpart, even if its blacks are little too dark at times. The Elektra costume is a nice cherry red while the foliage is a rich green, and the detail is extremely textured. The audio presentation on the Blu-ray is also simply excellent, with a rocking DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track that will put your sound system to the test. There are a number of cross-channel effects and the LFE channel positively throbs with energy. All around, an extremely effective audio presentation that is definitely better than its DVD counterpart.The supplements are headlined by ""Reign of Fire"" director Rob Bowman and an interestingly making of documentary that is significantly longer than the film it covers. In two parts, the ""Relentless: Making of Elektra"" clocks in at 2 hours 20 minutes. But, there's more, we are also treated to a 52 minute ""Elektra: Incarnations"" documentary that examines Elektra in the comic books. There's also a 15-minute ""Elektra in Greek Mythology"" which details, variations of the Elektra story in mythology. Rounding out the supplements is over 13 minutes of alternate or extended scenes, 5 minutes of deleted scenes, 2 trailers and a 2-minute + multi-angle feature of the fight scene at the well.So, the verdict. If you are an Elektra fan, or a fan of Jennifer Garner at her sexiest, this Blu-ray as a purchase is a no brainer. The movie itself is popcorn fun, if terribly written, and the supplements are probably the most extensive you are likely to ever see. If the price point is right you should add this Blu-ray to your collection.",4,One for Jennifer Garner and ALIAS fans,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,4698,"['was', 'sitting', 'female', 'friend', 'mine', 'looking', 'selection', 'DVDs', 'check', 'out', 'came', 'latest', 'martial', 'arts', 'superhero', 'flick', 'ELEKTRA', 'Turning', 'pointing', 'cover', 'shot', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'said', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'girls', 'HOT', 'major', 'draw', 'movie', 'impressive', 'action', 'scenes', 'Garner', 'ALIAS', 'tv', 'show', 'fighting', 'chops', 'practice', 'once', 'more', 'heart', 'pounding', 'series', 'set', 'pieces.But', 'main', 'attraction', 'acknowledged', 'reluctantly', 'Garner', 'pre-release', 'publicity', 'Garners', 'super-sexy', 'physique', 'nicely', 'accented', 'skin-tight', 'red', 'outfit', 'movie.Serious', 'thought-provoking', 'drama', 'not', 'credit', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'Sure', 'character', 'angst', 'part', 'Elektra', 'dealing', 'death', 'mother', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'being', 'assigned', 'kill', 'young', 'girl', 'father', 'lesbian', 'subtext', 'most', 'visibly', 'illustrated', 'main', 'female', 'villainess', 'giving', 'Elektra', 'quite', 'literally', 'kiss', 'death', 'character', 'part', 'father', 'daughter', 'most', 'part', 'entire', 'cast', 'realize', 'pure', 'popcorn', 'fodder', 'act', 'accordingly.The', 'plot', 'what', 'title', 'character', 'assassin', 'hire', 'seemingly', 'ghost-like', 'figure', 'who', 'can', 'evade', 'high-tech', 'security', 'systems', 'get', 'prey', 'Then', 'waiting', 'next', 'assignment', 'precocious', 'young', 'girl', 'Abby', 'Kirsten', 'Prout', 'protective', 'father', 'played', 'Goran', 'Visnjic', 'Eventually', 'orders', 'arrive', 'targets', 'are', 'two', 'Feeling', 'connection', 'young', 'girl', 'Elektra', 'protect', 'race', 'keep', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'mystical', 'criminal', 'organization', 'known', 'only', 'Hand.Not', 'surprisingly', 'actor', 'who', 'impressed', 'most', 'venerable', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'who', 'Elektra', 'mentor', 'Stick', 'also', 'turning', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'young', 'Prout', 'who', 'almost', 'scene', 'appears.Directed', 'Rob', 'Bowman', 'who', 'proved', 'could', 'direct', 'action', 'well', 'excellent', 'modern-day', 'dragon', 'picture', 'REIGN', 'OF', 'FIRE', 'movie', 'along', 'fair', 'clip', 'not', 'outstay', 'welcome', 'not', 'high', 'drama', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'nonsense', 'action', 'flick', 'will', 'appeal', 'ALIAS', 'fans', 'most', 'alpha-males', 'who', 'appreciate', 'suspenseful', 'tension', 'filled', 'action', 'scenes', 'shots', 'Garner', 'navel-revealing', 'outfits.The', 'DVD', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'deleted', 'good', 'reason', 'rather', 'EPK', 'fluff', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'Bowman', 'Garner', 'piece', 'Garner', 'time', 'Comic', 'Convention', 'rather', 'nifty', 'editing-room', 'feature', 'trailer', 'Hopefully', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'movie', 'passed', 'cult-favorite', 'status', 'bound', 'become', 'will', 'get', 'Bowman', 'Garner', 'together', 'audio', 'commentary.Until', 'day', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'straightforward', 'good', 'natured', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'fun.Blu-ray', 'update', 'video', 'quality', 'high', 'definition', 'Blu-ray', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'easily', 'standard', 'def', 'DVD', 'counterpart', 'even', 'blacks', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'dark', 'times', 'Elektra', 'costume', 'nice', 'cherry', 'red', 'foliage', 'rich', 'green', 'detail', 'extremely', 'textured', 'audio', 'presentation', 'Blu-ray', 'also', 'simply', 'excellent', 'rocking', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'surround', 'track', 'will', 'put', 'sound', 'system', 'test', 'are', 'number', 'cross-channel', 'effects', 'LFE', 'channel', 'positively', 'energy', 'around', 'extremely', 'effective', 'audio', 'presentation', 'definitely', 'better', 'DVD', 'counterpart.The', 'supplements', 'are', 'headlined', 'Reign', 'Fire', 'director', 'Rob', 'Bowman', 'interestingly', 'making', 'documentary', 'significantly', 'longer', 'film', 'two', 'parts', 'Relentless', 'Making', 'Elektra', 'clocks', '2', 'hours', '20', 'minutes', 'more', 'are', 'also', 'treated', '52', 'minute', 'Elektra', 'Incarnations', 'documentary', 'examines', 'Elektra', 'comic', 'books', 'also', '15-minute', 'Elektra', 'Greek', 'Mythology', 'details', 'variations', 'Elektra', 'story', 'mythology', 'Rounding', 'out', 'supplements', '13', 'minutes', 'alternate', 'extended', 'scenes', '5', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', '2', 'trailers', '2-minute', '+', 'multi-angle', 'feature', 'fight', 'scene', 'well.So', 'verdict', 'are', 'Elektra', 'fan', 'fan', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'sexiest', 'Blu-ray', 'purchase', 'brainer', 'movie', 'popcorn', 'fun', 'terribly', 'written', 'supplements', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'extensive', 'are', 'likely', 'ever', 'see', 'price', 'point', 'right', 'should', 'add', 'Blu-ray', 'collection']",N/A

885753,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B0007P0Y7C,David Bower,"[1, 1]",There is more emotion and drama in this film than one would expect from the type of movie this is represented to be. I can see why those who are dedicated to unstopping carnage would find this one too introspective and reflective on the emotions and much too short on action. At the beginning the viewer is advised of the ongoing battle between the forces of good and evil and then the movie proceeds to explore its manifestation in the lives of a small group of people on both sides of the conflict.There are a lot of flashbacks that show the circumstances surrounding the development of Elektra's personality and priorities and show the internal battles she is waging between anger and love. The horrible circumstances surrounding her discovery of her mother's body when she was a child continues to haunt her and serve as a catalyst for her anger. The movie is primarily about Elektra's development as a fighter for good as she discovers her true nature is more inclined toward good than toward evil. In the course of this discovery she places herself in great danger protecting two people who will have more significance in her life than she ever expects.If one can accept the required assumptions the movie can be entertaining. It is something of a departure from the norm but may be acceptable to some.

People were getting pierced through the chest, blood was seeping in the weapons, and there was a brief decapitation, yet why were the bad guys turn into green smoke when they're killed?  The movie never explained why they evaporate into green gas, so there's no point for the violent director's cut to not just leave them as corpses.  It's about as pointless as the making of this movie.""Elektra"" is an underwhelming, unnecessary spinoff to a below-par superhero movie.  There isn't much to tell about Elektra that I should care about, it's just another boring revenge/redemption tale that's already been told in ""Daredevil"".  It started off with a pointless entry scene when she assassinated some guy, and then she was tasked to kill a family of two but then she suddenly had a change of heart due to mommy issues and thus she's defending them while fighting against the one that killed her family (or at least her mother, it never showed what happened to her pappy).  I never really liked the daughter and father of the targeted family, the daughter comes off as selfish, even after the revelation about her was given, while the father is for the most part irrelevant.  These two are mostly there to intrude Elektra's actions, and characters who interfere are never likable.  As for the villains, members of The Hand, it's amazing how they're initially portrayed as a powerful force and the organization became less relevant as the plot goes on, leading to only a few baddies taking action.  The supervillains actually look cool in design (except for that Poison Ivy rip-off), that Tattoo guy given special notice, but how they're defeated was very anti-climatic.The plot is secondary to special effects, and even then, the special effects were poorly done.  They tried too hard to show off, and a couple of effects were blatantly obviously like the bracelet attack by a certain character.  Most of the effects are even impractical, like how that main villain can quick-dash which leaves a trail and yet why doesn't he used that technique AND attack his foe at the same time.  A lot of characters used that quick move to appear and reappear on screen, yet I find that to be a lazy effect.

Ben Affleck was effectively blind and dysfunctional as Daredevil; Christian Bale much less appealing (in my humble opine) as a wimpy Batman.  But when it comes to a super hero who can simultaneously kick arse and hold a guilt-ridden pity party, no one can hold a candle to sleek bombshell Jennifer Garner; not only that, she wears a red outfit that makes Viagra a mere breath mint, and she moves and grooves in ways that make ELEKTRA serve its very own call of the wild.The plot is campy and goofy, but name me a super hero plot that isn't.  Garner's Elektra is a professional assasin (what a way to go), only she's taken a gig she can't complete; meanwhile, she's pitted against some supernatural ninja-types (talk to the Hand) who share a commonality with her high-drama past.  She fights, she pouts, she swims to relieve her guilt, then--like all action heroes--she comes back from near-death to become an invincible villain mauler.Garner makes this film so much fun to watch; she's beautiful, graceful, exotic, and deadly, and I want to take my next vacation in her dimple.

Differences in the two cuts are minimal. If you've seen one, you've pretty much seen the other.Director Rob Bowman writes that he spent approximately 14 weeks ""personally handcrafting the movie [director's cut] for home theatre"" in that he ""re-color-timed every shot, changed some of the music, added in new footage, added visual effects"" and remixed the sound specifically for a home theatre system. Maybe when you're as close to the work as Bowman all that makes a great difference, but as the end recipient of all that effort, honestly, I can barely tell the difference.So if the director's cut itself isn't worth the price of admission, what of the special features on the second disk? They're fairly lame. I was especially disappointed by the history of Elektra in comics. On several Marvel movie DVDs lately an ""extra"" has been an in-depth history of a particular comic book/character, from its beginning to the present, and interviews with many of the creative folk who've worked it over the years. In particular the retrospectives on the Punisher and Avengers were both excellent.That is not the case with the Elektra retrospective. The interviews with important creators (Frank Miller, Klaus Janson, Bill Sienkiewicz, Brian Michael Bendis, Greg Rucka) are all there, but the material is presented in an extremely disjointed fashion, and there are many obscure references to other creators, other storylines, other industry personnel spread throughout that are never followed up on or explained. This will all be horribly confusing to anyone but a long-term, hardcore comics fan. I've been collecting comics for decades and have read most of the stories featuring Elektra so I was able to follow what was said; actually there was little here that was new to me. But as I watched this thing I was struck, again and again, by the thought that, had I been simply the average, non-comics-geek moviegoer, there were so many moments when I would have had no idea what they were talking about.As to the Elektra movie per se, I liked it. And that surprised me because I despised everything about the Daredevil film including Jennifer Garner's Elektra. The Elektra movie is much better. I have to give Garner credit, after the critical drubbing and mediocre box office response accorded Daredevil, for having the guts to revisit the character. Having now watched her play Elektra in a decent movie, I realize that in Daredevil, along with everyone else in the film, Jennifer Garner was simply the victim of a bad script and director.I give the theatrical cut of Elektra four stars. Not a great movie, but a pretty darn good little super-hero flick. I give the director's cut one star, not because it's any worse than the theatrical cut, but because it's not significantly different, thus can't justify its own existence.",1,Save Your Money,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,2952,"['liked', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'Elektra', 'might', 'be', 'wondering', 'money', 'buy', 'director', 'cut', 'would', 'say', 'Differences', 'two', 'cuts', 'are', 'minimal', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', ""'ve"", 'pretty', 'much', 'seen', 'other.Director', 'Rob', 'Bowman', 'spent', 'approximately', '14', 'weeks', 'personally', 'handcrafting', 'movie', '[', 'director', 'cut', ']', 'home', 'theatre', 're-color-timed', 'shot', 'changed', 'music', 'added', 'new', 'footage', 'added', 'visual', 'effects', 'remixed', 'sound', 'specifically', 'home', 'theatre', 'system', 'Maybe', 'when', ""'re"", 'close', 'work', 'Bowman', 'great', 'difference', 'end', 'recipient', 'effort', 'honestly', 'can', 'barely', 'tell', 'difference.So', 'director', 'cut', ""n't"", 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'what', 'special', 'features', 'second', 'disk', ""'re"", 'fairly', 'lame', 'was', 'especially', 'disappointed', 'history', 'Elektra', 'comics', 'several', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'DVDs', 'lately', 'extra', 'been', 'in-depth', 'history', 'particular', 'comic', 'book/character', 'beginning', 'present', 'interviews', 'many', 'creative', 'folk', 'who', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'years', 'particular', 'retrospectives', 'Punisher', 'Avengers', 'were', 'excellent.That', 'not', 'case', 'Elektra', 'retrospective', 'interviews', 'important', 'creators', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Klaus', 'Janson', 'Bill', 'Sienkiewicz', 'Brian', 'Michael', 'Bendis', 'Greg', 'Rucka', 'are', 'there', 'material', 'presented', 'extremely', 'disjointed', 'fashion', 'are', 'many', 'obscure', 'references', 'other', 'creators', 'other', 'storylines', 'other', 'industry', 'personnel', 'spread', 'are', 'never', 'followed', 'up', 'explained', 'will', 'be', 'horribly', 'confusing', 'anyone', 'long-term', 'hardcore', 'comics', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'been', 'collecting', 'comics', 'decades', 'have', 'read', 'most', 'stories', 'featuring', 'Elektra', 'was', 'able', 'follow', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'actually', 'was', 'little', 'here', 'was', 'new', 'watched', 'thing', 'was', 'struck', 'again', 'again', 'thought', 'had', 'been', 'simply', 'average', 'non-comics-geek', 'moviegoer', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'moments', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'were', 'talking', 'about.As', 'Elektra', 'movie', 'se', 'liked', 'surprised', 'despised', 'everything', 'Daredevil', 'film', 'including', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Elektra', 'Elektra', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'have', 'give', 'Garner', 'credit', 'critical', 'drubbing', 'mediocre', 'box', 'office', 'response', 'accorded', 'Daredevil', 'having', 'guts', 'revisit', 'character', 'Having', 'now', 'watched', 'play', 'Elektra', 'decent', 'movie', 'realize', 'Daredevil', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'was', 'simply', 'victim', 'bad', 'script', 'director.I', 'give', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'Elektra', 'four', 'stars', 'Not', 'great', 'movie', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'little', 'super-hero', 'flick', 'give', 'director', 'cut', 'one', 'star', 'not', 'worse', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'not', 'significantly', 'different', 'thus', 'ca', ""n't"", 'justify', 'own', 'existence']",N/A

But in the comic book world, death is less restricting than a sprained knee: Elektra is resurrected by the magical mystical powers of Terence Stamp (okay, his character is ungracefully called Stick).

Beset by childhood traumas, Elektra decides to protect the two of them from the Hand, a magical bunch of Japanese evildoers who have decided to kill Abby.When a movie is a cash-in spinoff of a cinematic disaster like ""Daredevil,"" you can't expect it to be good.

It seems that Bowman's real talent lies in television sitcoms where his abilities have been exemplified in over 30 X-Files episodes, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Quantum Leap, and various other (forgettable) shows (like Baywatch).I'm not sure what the screenwriters were thinking when they conjured the screenplay up. To be honest, upon one viewing of this film, I'm unsure as to whether the screenwriters even read up on the character of Elektra and Frank Miller's work in molding the character.Ever since Frank Miller took over responsibilities with Daredevil issue #168 (1981), he created one of the darkest, emotionally evocative, and moving characters ever created in comics. And with the comic series that premiered in 2001, she even took a darker turn. Elektra is a troubled individual, an assassin, hired hitman, one who lives for violence seemingly to replace missing puzzle pieces in her life....this movie seems to ignore ALL of those things. The Elektra I'm used to barely has a conscience; the film Elektra is pretty soft-core. The Hand in the comics are a band of hellish, devious ninja-types; the Hand in the movie are a bunch of Hollywood-style souped up dorks. There are more things akin to this...the film just misses the mark.My other grumblings are as follows: the pace of the film was sluggish, picking up at times, but dragging for the most part. The other nitpick is the film is overly short for a 21st century non-family type film! It's 97 minutes long!!! By the time the action starts to pick up a little toward the end, it's already almost over!I thought it was a little weird how in Daredevil, it seemed to suggest that had a sequel been released Matt Murdock would definitely be included. But I suppose we should all be happy that Ben Affleck decided to sit this one out. (I would compare his skills with that of Tom Cruise.)Elektra proves to be an entertaining movie in the face of its sluggish and mediocre nature. But if you're not doing anything, it's pretty neat to check out although you probably won't want to ever watch it again. As a former avid comic reader, I don't know if it's just me, but it seems as if Marvel's movie company has REALLY been slacking lately, ever since The Hulk (which was absolutely TERRIBLE), and the lackluster Fantastic Four. Hopefully, this year's X3 will be Marvel's saving grace.",3,Entertaining but Mediocre,1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,2415,"['Director', 'Rob', 'Bowman', 'latest', 'film', 'lukewarm', 'review', 'Bowman', 'real', 'talent', 'television', 'sitcoms', 'where', 'abilities', 'have', 'been', 'exemplified', '30', 'X-Files', 'episodes', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'various', 'other', 'forgettable', 'Baywatch', '.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'screenwriters', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'conjured', 'screenplay', 'up', 'be', 'honest', 'one', 'viewing', 'film', ""'m"", 'unsure', 'screenwriters', 'even', 'read', 'up', 'character', 'Elektra', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'work', 'molding', 'character.Ever', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'took', 'over', 'responsibilities', 'Daredevil', 'issue', '168', '1981', 'created', 'one', 'darkest', 'emotionally', 'evocative', 'moving', 'characters', 'ever', 'created', 'comics', 'comic', 'series', 'premiered', '2001', 'even', 'took', 'darker', 'turn', 'Elektra', 'troubled', 'individual', 'assassin', 'hired', 'hitman', 'one', 'who', 'violence', 'seemingly', 'replace', 'missing', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'life', '.this', 'movie', 'ignore', 'things', 'Elektra', ""'m"", 'used', 'barely', 'conscience', 'film', 'Elektra', 'pretty', 'soft-core', 'Hand', 'comics', 'are', 'band', 'hellish', 'devious', 'ninja-types', 'Hand', 'movie', 'are', 'bunch', 'Hollywood-style', 'souped', 'up', 'dorks', 'are', 'more', 'things', 'akin', 'film', 'just', 'mark.My', 'other', 'grumblings', 'are', 'pace', 'film', 'was', 'sluggish', 'picking', 'up', 'times', 'dragging', 'most', 'part', 'other', 'nitpick', 'film', 'overly', 'short', '21st', 'century', 'non-family', 'type', 'film', '97', 'minutes', 'long', 'time', 'action', 'pick', 'up', 'little', 'end', 'already', 'almost', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'weird', 'how', 'Daredevil', 'seemed', 'suggest', 'had', 'sequel', 'been', 'released', 'Matt', 'Murdock', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'included', 'suppose', 'should', 'be', 'happy', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'decided', 'sit', 'one', 'out', 'would', 'compare', 'skills', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Elektra', 'be', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'face', 'sluggish', 'mediocre', 'nature', ""'re"", 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'pretty', 'neat', 'check', 'out', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'ever', 'watch', 'again', 'former', 'avid', 'comic', 'reader', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'company', 'REALLY', 'been', 'slacking', 'lately', 'ever', 'Hulk', 'was', 'absolutely', 'TERRIBLE', 'lackluster', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Hopefully', 'year', 'X3', 'will', 'be', 'Marvel', 'saving', 'grace']",N/A

Then something completely unexpected occurs. A band of villains are introduced, who have been employed by ""The Hand"" to recover ""The Treasure"". They look like a group of Circus Carney misfits; however, from this point on, the film makes a dramatic turn around.The group is commanded by Roshi, an upcoming lieutenant in ""The Hand"" organization. His fellow accomplices include: Stone, Tattoo, and Typhoid. Stone is basically your impenetrable being, impervious to guns, bullets, or knives; however, he is quite susceptible to huge sycamores. Tattoo, by far my favorite of the clan, can morph the creatures which are stenciled on his body into life; and Typhoid, who possesses the Kiss-of-Death. She's quite bitter because at one time she was once ""The Treasure"".These characters are far more interesting than Elektra, and in my opinion, single-handedly save this picture.

That being said, this vehicle for Jennifer Garner as the title comic book heroine is full of surprises.  Certainly none of the surprises are associated with the formulaic plot, a plot made worse with some mediocre script writing.  The pleasures are in the cinematography which detail elegant views of what appears to be the Pacific Northwest, in the presence of some very fine actors chronically underused (Terence Stamp, Colin Cunningham,  Goran Visnjic so memorable from THE DEEP END, and American Korean Will Yun Lee voted one of the world's most beautiful people in 2002), and in the nicely choreographed martial arts sequences which unfortunately are marred by victims swirling into sulfurous dust in demise.The story is simply Good versus Evil, the Good being Jennifer Garner's pouty-lipped Elektra, Terence Stamp's dignified mentor Stick, and father daughter team of Visnjic and Kirsten Prout and the Bad being the Hand of Asian guys headed by Roshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Kirigi (the dashing Will Yun Lee), and some truly obnoxious creatures such as Tattoo (Chris Ackerman) whose body art comes to vivid life as various demons, and the well-named Typhoid (a truly awful Natassia Malthe) who is a parody of the entire comic genre.The thing that makes ELEKTRA work is the grounding of the film in natural settings instead of the usual hokey castles and dungeons replete with flying monsters and disintegrating planets.

I only vaguely recall the plot and some rather boring scenes.Don't get me wrong, the actress is hot, and she does a little butt kicking, but if you want action I'd recommend movies with Milla Jovovich, such asUltraviolet (Unrated, Extended Cut),Resident Evil - The High-Definition Trilogy (Resident Evil/ Resident Evil: Apocalypse/ Resident Evil: Extinction) [Blu-ray], etc., or Kate Beckinsale;Underworld (Unrated) [Blu-ray],Underworld - Evolution (Widescreen Special Edition), and obscure flicks such asBloodrayne (Unrated Director's Cut)(DVD ROM game is included).Elektra was not very electrifying.

One of the things i respect this movie for is the less use of blood compared to other Marvel flicks, because while the other movies are good, they use way too much violence to try to appeal to fans. Elektra is very dark, in fact when i compare this to the rest of Marvels movies, this is the darkest. Jennifer Garner is stunning as Elektra, and so is Kirsten Prout who plays a very well done Abby Miller. You have to have an imagination to watch this film, because everything is exaggerated when compared to reality, like Elektra getting kicked in the face and flying through the air for about 20 feet.Will Yun Lee and Jennifer Garners fight scenes, in my opinion, outdo most of the Marvel movies. Because not only are they using real weapons, but they are also doing their own stunts. The CGI is simplistic compared to Spider-man and Daredevil, but i think that is why it is so good. Because it gives the movie a very comicbook look.A very low budgeted film, well atleast it's cheap compared to some of the recent films in theaters. Just breaking 43 million dollars to make, the low budget was mainly due to the fact that a lot of the enviroments they are in are real, some is stage, but most is real. Average box-office, 24 million in the U.S. I think it was mainly due to late advertising of the movie, but it did manage to gross 30 million around the world, same as the Punisher. But overall, box-office gross does not mean this isn't good, this movie is really good, in fact i think it is superior to some of Marvels other films.",5,Very Serious Marvel Movie,1113177600,"04 11, 2005",2005,1614,"['loved', 'movie', 'style', 'very', 'serious', 'hardly', 'comedy', 'movie', 'One', 'things', 'i', 'respect', 'movie', 'less', 'use', 'blood', 'compared', 'other', 'Marvel', 'flicks', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'use', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'violence', 'try', 'appeal', 'fans', 'Elektra', 'very', 'dark', 'fact', 'when', 'i', 'compare', 'rest', 'Marvels', 'movies', 'darkest', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'stunning', 'Elektra', 'so', 'Kirsten', 'Prout', 'who', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Abby', 'Miller', 'have', 'have', 'imagination', 'watch', 'film', 'everything', 'exaggerated', 'when', 'compared', 'reality', 'Elektra', 'getting', 'kicked', 'face', 'flying', 'air', '20', 'feet.Will', 'Yun', 'Lee', 'Jennifer', 'Garners', 'fight', 'scenes', 'opinion', 'most', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'using', 'real', 'weapons', 'are', 'also', 'doing', 'own', 'stunts', 'CGI', 'simplistic', 'compared', 'Spider-man', 'Daredevil', 'i', 'think', 'why', 'so', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'comicbook', 'look.A', 'very', 'low', 'budgeted', 'film', 'well', 'cheap', 'compared', 'recent', 'films', 'theaters', 'Just', 'breaking', '43', 'million', 'dollars', 'make', 'low', 'budget', 'was', 'mainly', 'due', 'fact', 'lot', 'enviroments', 'are', 'are', 'real', 'stage', 'most', 'real', 'Average', 'box-office', '24', 'million', 'U.S', 'think', 'was', 'mainly', 'due', 'late', 'advertising', 'movie', 'did', 'manage', 'gross', '30', 'million', 'world', 'same', 'Punisher', 'overall', 'box-office', 'gross', 'not', 'mean', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'fact', 'i', 'think', 'superior', 'Marvels', 'other', 'films']",N/A

Thankfully, Elektra has a prettier lead and stronger direction from Rob Bowman, who seems to have ditched the slimy creature effects he seemed so fond of in X-Files and Reign of Fire.Daredevil is nowhere near as popular in the collective public conscience as Spiderman or even the Hulk. So imagine why Elektra failed at the Box Office. The whole world saw the poster and thought 'Who is she supposed to be?'. Either that or they saw the horrible, highly cliched trailer that totally misrepresented the film.The resulting critical mauling by just about everyone wasn't completely fair nor was it completely unexpected. The film reeks of deleted scenes and subplots that have been completely cut out. It fades out at the 90-minute mark, leaving us wondering why they even bothered.However, what we do get is a mild, but nonetheless entertaining action movie with an almost constant spooky atmosphere. The plot is meagre and many of the subs and tangents are never explained or developed. Or they were then got cut out in the editing room (along with Ben Affleck, thankfully)? If they got Frank Miller (he did create the character after all!) to write the script instead of 3 nobodies then it could have been something special.The DVD is in crisp 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with loud, sometimes dynamic Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. Besides a trailer for the new Family Guy series the extras are of the usual 'whogivesadamn' lot.Perhaps a future directors cut will improve the film, but as it is Elektra is hardly brilliant, but definitely an above average brainless movie.",3,Better than expected,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,1688,"['thought', 'Daredevil', 'was', 'absolutely', 'pointless', 'film', 'anonymous', 'direction', 'unappealing', 'non-unapalling', 'lead', 'actor', 'Thankfully', 'Elektra', 'prettier', 'lead', 'stronger', 'direction', 'Rob', 'Bowman', 'who', 'have', 'ditched', 'slimy', 'creature', 'effects', 'seemed', 'so', 'fond', 'X-Files', 'Reign', 'Fire.Daredevil', 'nowhere', 'near', 'popular', 'collective', 'public', 'conscience', 'Spiderman', 'even', 'Hulk', 'So', 'imagine', 'why', 'Elektra', 'failed', 'Box', 'Office', 'whole', 'world', 'saw', 'poster', 'thought', ""'Who"", 'supposed', 'be', 'saw', 'horrible', 'highly', 'cliched', 'trailer', 'totally', 'misrepresented', 'film.The', 'resulting', 'critical', 'mauling', 'just', 'everyone', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'fair', 'was', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'film', 'reeks', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'subplots', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'cut', 'out', 'out', '90-minute', 'mark', 'leaving', 'wondering', 'why', 'even', 'bothered.However', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'mild', 'nonetheless', 'entertaining', 'action', 'movie', 'almost', 'constant', 'spooky', 'atmosphere', 'plot', 'meagre', 'many', 'subs', 'tangents', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'developed', 'were', 'then', 'got', 'cut', 'out', 'editing', 'room', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'thankfully', 'got', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'did', 'create', 'character', 'write', 'script', 'instead', '3', 'nobodies', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'special.The', 'DVD', 'crisp', '2.35:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'loud', 'sometimes', 'dynamic', 'Dolby/DTS', '5.1', 'sound', 'trailer', 'new', 'Family', 'Guy', 'series', 'extras', 'are', 'usual', ""'whogivesadamn"", 'lot.Perhaps', 'future', 'directors', 'cut', 'will', 'improve', 'film', 'Elektra', 'hardly', 'brilliant', 'definitely', 'above', 'average', 'brainless', 'movie']",N/A

That's how they were sucessful at first, don't go rewriting the whole orgin and look. And you wonder why it sucked? It was amazing Hollywood let it out of the editing room, (but they let Gigli out too, so no surprise there.)It looks promising from the opening credits, but goes downhill from there. i think they tried to pull too many elemnts on what made the Alias series sucessful for Jen and tried to recreate it here. Alias is good for the show, not for a totally different charecter.The cameo for Ben Afflect doesn't help, since Daredevil wasn't all that great and Ben Afflect, again, can't act.

Its worth four stars in my opinion.I guess people complained about the long times where action was not shown, but rather, character development. I am truly saddened by this because people can't seem to look past the flare moves and look for a believeable, well made character. The movie shows human growth in Jennifer's character, particularly finding her conscience and her purpose. She started as someone who just killed no matter if she worked for the good or the bad to being someone who can make choices between good and evil, and knowing how to use her skills for the betterment of someone else's, not just herself. THe paradoxical idea of helping someone to regain her life made Elektra regain her own life is beautiful to know. I hope that someone finds this truly a beatiful theme.Another is that Elektra is shown as human as possible. She has no super human powers but rather, she learned her talents. She was not born to know kimagure or the usage of sais. She had to learn them. She doesnt' have super human abilities like jumping extreme heights or having mutant powers. She was very much human and her actions reflect that human physics, true physics. When she jumps, she jumps in a humanly possible way, not zooming up the air like other superheros. She is grounded to that humanity and that is quite impressive to see.Cinematography was okay. The direction wasn't all that but the tone is. Its the first superhero movie with that sullen, dark, consistent tone that is beautiful to watch. It made me focus on Elektra and her humanity. The movie isn't about how a hero saves others. Its about finding that hero's purpose and growing as a person. It is not about being someone who can save others or do great things but rather, it is about Elektra and how she was able to find herself and straighten out her life.WIth that, I hope I have convinced everyone that the movie is not that bad.

Garner never mentions Daredevil once, never mentions her dad who was killed by Bullseye either. Hell she's even wearing the chain she left for DareDevil to show him she was alive.  It's only mentioned that...she died once ""which happened in Daredevil"".  Since Elektra is such a tough girl you'd think she'd go right after Bullseye once again. That would've made a better movie instead of the one with the silly plot we get. I mean if you saw the DareDevil director's cut or watched the scene in the credits you'd see that Bullseye never died.Anyway after she was killed by Bullseye she was brought back by a blind warriar named Stick (Terrence Stamp). This movie almost basically just acts like Daredevil never happened despite explaning how she is alive. That's a flaw that is hard to look passed. Maybe the movie would've been better if Daredevil was never made. Then again you'd still have those silly bad guys with tattoos that come to life. They even burst to dust when being killed like they're vampires or something. Anyway Elektra becomes an assasin and starts to kill with no feelings what so ever. Then she's assigned to kill a girl and father neighbors who she just got to know and like. She can't do it and then replacements are sent to do it instead "" I know, sounds straight from the Replacement Killers"" and she's forced to protect them.Garner is hot as always and is gonna probably be the next Julia Roberts but here she seems lost at times. She was probably thinking about how one episode of Alias even has a better plot than this whole movie. She still is one tough chick and it's fun watching her kick ass. Although it is silly how she moves super quick from one place to whisper in a guys ear and then moves back to where she was so she could throw a knife in his back.  The action still is ok and the movie looks great as well.

I'll say one thing, ""Elektra"" is a busy little movie.  While entertaining you with the immediate (and fast-paced) story at hand, it also finds time to explain and update us on many aspects of Elektra's past, including how she acquired all those amazing fighting skills she displayed in ""Daredevil"", how she came back from the dead after the end of said film, how and why she eventually had a falling out with her life-saving benefactors and became the assassin for hire she is at the beginning of this film, etc., etc.  So, the movie does all that AND relates her big battle with the evil, mystical group known only as The Hand (the movie's main story), thus paving the road to her redemption.  And it does all this in a shade over 90 minutes.  Whew!A longer, more epic-like movie- with a little more breathing space- might have been better, but who knows for sure?  It's important to remember, after all, that many comics fans weren't all that keen on Elektra's return from the dead in the comics, either (after her memorable death in Daredevil #181), and that some comics readers enjoyed her post-resurrection stories and some didn't.  So it feels kind of appropriate that the movie also generates ambivelent feelings along the lines of ""yeah, it's a good enough movie, but did they really need to bring her back from the dead?""The often-talked-about (""it's in the movie... no, wait, they changed their mind and took it out!"") cameo appearance by Ben Affleck's Matt Murdock / Daredevil character is finally available for your viewing pleasure in the deleted scenes section, and it's very brief.  Essentially it's Elektra seeing Matt in a dream where he says ""Come back to me"" and she replies ""When I'm ready.""  That it's, fifteen seconds tops.  It was so brief that it was silly that they cut it.  It would have provided a nice bit of continuity while also demonstrating that Elektra hadn't completely forgotten or blown off her previous experiences with Matt Murdock.  Oh, well... at least the moment can been seen in some fashion now.The amount of DVD extras are pretty much just right for an entertaining but ultimately- let's be honest- marginal film like this one... you get a few deleted scenes, a couple of featurettes, and a commentary (which I haven't checked out yet).  This may sound like a weird complaint, but I think that too often DVDs give you way too much in the ""extras"" department, more than most films actually warrant.  To me, that's almost as bad as DVD's that give you little or no extras.  The extras offered here, which are interesting and to the point, feel just right.So, in the end, if you keep your expectations in check, I think you'll generally enjoy watching Jennifer Garner take on a variety of colorful villains for an hour and a half.

I'm pretty sure they were mostly damning with faint praise. After all Jennifer, while certainly an attractive female, came across as a sorority pledge playing dress-up on S and M rush night.In Elektra she looks even more ridiculous. There have been plenty of great female assassins over the years from the camp of a Bond villain, to the seductiveness of Linda Fiorentino, even the girl next-door deadliness of Bridget Fonda in Point of No Return. Female assassins are a wonderful staple of filmdom, seductive yet deadly. Garner is neither. ""She looks like she is thinking of puppies,"" claimed one reviewer I read and I concur. If the Smurfs were X-rated ninja's, then Garner would still be miscast in Smurfette: Deadly Blue.Her costumes certainly don't help her cause. You almost have the urge to tell her to put some clothes on and bright red Victoria Secret lingerie just doesn't scream stealth or deadly. Lord knows the rest of this mess doesn't help Garner either.While Terrance Stamp can do no wrong every else seems either miscast or afraid of stealing Garner's thunder. Add on poor special effects, villains that turn into family friendly yellow smoke when killed, ninjas that crash through windows like Army rangers, gas stoves that explode like nuclear weapons, laundry fu, Japanese villains out of a World War 2 propaganda film and my personal favorite the warmest Christmas in Canadian history.The movie clearly takes place in the northwest United States or Vancouver. The days are long, everyone is in short sleeves, and Garner takes recreational swims in the lake.

885799,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0007P0Y7C,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 0]","Spin-offs are something of a rarity in Hollywood. Well, let me clarify that statement for a moment, spin-offs occur frequently in television, but with feature films they are far less common. When they have occurred in the movies they tend to not be as successful as the film or film series that inspired them. A few examples of spin-off feature films that had varying degrees of success or lack there of, are as follows: ""The Scorpion King"" (moderately successful), ""Supergirl"" (massive flop), and ""Catwoman"" (even worse than ""Supergirl""). So, with only a couple of decent successes with spin-offs (""U.S. Marshals"" would be another one), it strikes me as odd that 20th Century Fox would choose to make one based on their 2002 smash hit ""Daredevil"", instead of going with a direct sequel. Whatever the motivation, the decision was made to move forward with ""Elektra"", and the final product we were given was an average action movie, mixed with elements of other assassin-themed films, and almost no connection to the original film that introduced the titular character.""Elektra"" picks up essentially where Elektra's story ended in ""Daredevil"", with her death at the hands of Bullseye. When all hope seemed lost, along comes a mysterious man named Stick (Terrence Stamp), a blind martial arts instructor that hopes to train and recruit Elektra to join him in an ongoing war against the evil organization known as The Hand. The Hand is also aware of Elektra and her abilities, and is just as interested in her joining their side as Stick is for his. However, Elektra's death and resurrection has left her cold, and she now uses the training she received from Stick as a means to become a world-renowned assassin. It's only a matter of time before Elektra's destiny catches up with her, and she will be forced to choose which side she will stand with.As I said before, I doubt I'll ever understand the reasoning behind going with a spin-off such as ""Elektra"" over making another ""Daredevil"" film. I know that Jennifer Garner's character of Elektra was popular, especially amongst male audience members; however, I have a hard time believing that the response to her character was so overwhelming to inspire the suits at Fox to believe in moving forward with a movie focused solely on her. I know that critics were unkind to ""Daredevil"", although movie audiences were much more in favor of the film; but based on box office returns and an almost universal panning by critics, I don't believe ""Elektra"" faired nearly as well as a ""Daredevil 2"" would have among moviegoers. So, I wonder now, can anyone at 20th Century Fox say the words ""Colossal faux pas""?The problem with ""Elektra"" isn't only the fact that it didn't make all that much money, but that it just wasn't on the same level as ""Daredevil"" or anything else that Marvel was placing in theaters at the time, or since then for that matter. The storyline was very simplistic for the most part, and truthfully, when the story stayed simple, that's when it entertained the best. When the story broke away from the simple plot and tried to get too complicated, that's when things first began to suffer. This was caused by the writers attempt at including a paper-thin psychological sub-plot for Elektra to deal with. Another set of problems for ""Elektra"" were caused by the lack of originality, brought on by borrowing heavily from other assassin-themed movies such as ""The Replacement Killers""; and lastly, all but severing all possible ties to the original film ""Daredevil"" that allowed this movie to happen in the first place. Now, the first two problems were troublesome enough to cause ""Elektra"" to lose points in my opinion; however, the almost complete omission of all things ""Daredevil"" bothers me the most. I know that many times spin-offs will not really do much to reference the original film(s) that created them, but most of those do not pick up part of their storyline wherever the original film left off. For that reason, I believe ""Elektra"" should have contained more than just a fleeting reference to the events of ""Daredevil"", and had they done so, I probably would have enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did.I'm sure after reading that previous paragraph that you are probably thinking that I barely enjoyed ""Elektra"". Well, for some unexplained reason (and that's the God's honest truth, I have no logical explanation for why), I actually did moderately enjoy ""Elektra"". It doesn't make sense to me at all, but there's just something about it that still appeals to me, regardless of all the problems I have with it, several of which I listed above. I'm sure the appeal of this movie has something to do with the fact that Jennifer Garner (""13 Going on 30"") stars in it, but I know that can't be the only reason, because if that were the case, I'd enjoy ""Catwoman"" due to Halle Berry (""X-Men: The Last Stand""), and believe me there is no enjoying that movie at all. The only thing I can come up with is that ""Elektra"" is simply one of my ""Guilty Pleasure"" movies and nothing more.Speaking of Jennifer Garner, she is one of the few bright spots for this movie, and I appreciated that she chose to reprise her role. Not to mention donning the bright red, skin tight leather costume this time around. I'm sure that the writers of the film, and probably even director Rob Bowman (""Reign of Fire""), had good intentions of giving Jennifer more to do than just appear somber and angry throughout the movie, in her defense she did always look great while acting as if she could kill you at any second, and no doubt the inclusion of the muddled psychological story for her character was an attempt to challenge Jennifer. However, even the best intentions can't always make things right, because aside from receiving a paycheck and having fun kicking butt onscreen again, based on what little else she had to do in the movie, I can't see any reason Jennifer would have for returning to this role.Alongside Jennifer Garner, the rest of the performances in the film were a mixture in quality, with very few worthy of note; and almost all across the board everyone appeared somewhat disconnected from the material. I don't know if a majority of the cast was given instructions to be flat when giving their line readings or what, but something definitely did not feel right much of the time. The only other cast member, besides Jennifer Garner, that I enjoyed having in the movie was Terrence Stamp (""Superman 2"") as Elektra's mysterious mentor, Stick. For some reason, I enjoyed watching him, and it wasn't that he did a whole heck of a lot; it's just the way in which he carries himself, just seems to command attention.One thing is for certain though; ""Elektra"" is by no means a great movie, in fact there were moments when I watched it that I found myself wondering if it's just barely above average. But, in the end I do feel that the movie does a decent job of entertaining me, and for that reason, as I said earlier, it warrant's itself a place in my favor as a guilty pleasure and not much more.On a side note, 20th Century Fox did give ""Elektra"" the same treatment they gave to ""Daredevil"" by releasing a Director's Cut of the film on DVD. Truthfully, I don't know how much was added or was different from the theatrical release, but it does seem like there is slightly more story included, and the movie seemed to work just a little bit better.""Elektra"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.""Elektra: The Director's Cut"" is unrated and contains violence and language.",3,Assassins Never Look This Good...,1120694400,"07 7,

885800,A4Q2UOVXW9477,B0007P0Y7C,Justin E. Miller,"[0, 1]","Garner Electrifies!- The Baltimore SunA Sleek Action Adventure!- Chicago ReaderHere you have the box reviews for Elektra. But let's face it. Everyone but the box seems to hate the movie. The question is will I?Well, it came of to a pretty slow start. So far the only thing I can tell is she has a bit of an obsessive compulsive disorder. Even JG in a bikini wasn't making this part of the movie all that good.The flashback dreams to when she is a kid seem to serve no purpose whatsoever. I have to give her props on her strength and endurance though. She's able to do one arm pull-ups, and I can't even do two of them with both arms.We're now twenty-seven minutes into the movie and this is extremely slooooooo[...] I thought this was supposed to be an action flick!And the plot thickens! I now see the issue! I knew that sort of before it started but didn't really seem to care.Okay, the first real action scene and it was pretty bland. Really short fight, a pair typical kung fu get your butt kicked loser dudes. Question is, when they disappeared into a plume of smoke, where did they go? They looked like real people to me. Another question is why would a bunch of Asians hire an American/Greek to learn their arts and try to take out someone? It makes no sense. I should point out I don't know the backstory behind Elektra, as to whether or not she debuted in DareDevil before spinning off into this.Oooh, billiards! Best part of the movie so far! Well, the tattoo that flies was pretty cool.Well, I just hit token funny part of action movie. Now a little bit later on, what I'm noticing in the thriller part is that the action is not even shown because of the rating of the movie (PG-13)Well, it's a wonder we had the girl-on-girl kiss in a movie like this. Oh well, it so far hasn't even been enough to make this a decent movie so far.I have issues with the dojo. Why would a blind white guy run a martial arts instruction school? He likes to speak like a proper English speaking Yoda as well. We learn that it was all a plot to get the kid into the school. Kirsten Prout looks like she could play a younger Jennifer Garner, which quiite possibly could be what they're going for here. I really don't think it's a subtlety.Okay, these flashbacks to when she was a kid are really getting annoying. They better actually serve a purpose or this will prove to be a pointless waste.Ooh, battle scene. Double sai vs. double katana. I wonder how many takes it took to get all the sheets to fall and not hit the main bad guy. Wow. Gotta love a guy whose tattoos can come to life.Oooh, I know what it is! They're all vampires! They disappear when you kill them. Eh, maybe not.And... movie over. Not even Jennifer Garner in red leather could make this one good. I'm certainly glad it was only a rental. They could have done more action scenes and supply us with a little more backstory other than ""she died in Daredevil."" People said Daredevil was crap, but I liked it, so I thought I might like this one. I didn't. I don't even want to waste my time with the special features. The only one that looks good is the ""sneak peek at the return of TV's 'Family Guy' and new series 'American Dad.'"" Just previews for the show. Alright.

885802,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0007P0Y7C,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 1]","""Elektra"" is one of the weakest entries into Marvel's recent string of films based on their comics.  I'm basing that statement on the fact that I've seen all of these films (from ""Blade"" to ""Fantastic Four"" and all of the adaptations and sequels in between, including both ""Punisher"" flicks).  Although it is a step above ""Hulk"" and miles above Dolph Lundgren's version of ""Punisher,"" this film isn't quite as good as the film that it was born from, ""Daredevil.""  Granted, ""Daredevil"" wasn't a real gem compared to its peers, but the character did have a lot more development than found in this film.""Elektra"" starts off fine enough, with a high body count that is sure to get any action fan a little giddy.  However, after this initial look at Jennifer Garner's title character at work, we are dumped into a long, drawn out and quite dull series of flashbacks and a sad attempt at the development of a plot.  When the action is on, this film is at its best, although some of the kung-foolery gets a little silly at times (especially the fight involving way too many bedsheets).  There are plenty of villains, but no one ultimate baddie.  Collectively, the villains are known as the Hand.  I'd love to have seen Elektra go at it with Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa's character, who really seems to be a bad guy in the wings.  Instead, Garner tackles a motley crew of a tattooed warrior, a chick with really strong breath, and a murdering ninja with lightning-fast moves, as well as a number of other, lesser villains.In the end, the viewer is left wondering just exactly what happened.  Why was Elektra so quick to protect the young girl and her father?  She had no clue why the Hand were after them initially.  Why couldn't she finish off some of the Hand while they were tracking their target?  She finished many of them off quite quickly when she put her mind to it.  There are a few other questions I could mention, but they may reveal too much.In closing, this is a ho-hum flick that tries too hard to be both an intellectual film with all of the flashbacks and an action flick.  What you end up with is a fluffy action flick with almost no plot development and zero character development.  In fact, this film had an advantage over other first films for comic characters:  no need to develop the main character.  That was done in ""Daredevil,"" which I have to give credit for building up two superheroes in one film.  That's the one thing that all comic flicks have to fight with initially.  ""Elektra"" didn't even use that to its advantage.  Instead, it played out as if it was looking for a plot, or at least a good reason, for our heroine to do what she did during the film.I only recommend this flick as a purchase to hardcore ""Elektra"" fans.  You may want to buy it if you, like me, are a completionist and just have to have every Marvel flick on DVD.  Otherwise I'd rent this film before laying any cash money down for it.  It's okay, but there are plenty of better comic flicks out there to purchase.",3,"Well, At Least It's Better Than ""Hulk""",1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,3000,"['Elektra', 'one', 'weakest', 'entries', 'Marvel', 'recent', 'string', 'films', 'based', 'comics', ""'m"", 'basing', 'statement', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'Blade', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'adaptations', 'sequels', 'including', 'Punisher', 'flicks', 'step', 'Hulk', 'miles', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'version', 'Punisher', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'born', 'Daredevil', 'Granted', 'Daredevil', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'gem', 'compared', 'peers', 'character', 'did', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'development', 'found', 'film', 'Elektra', 'fine', 'enough', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'sure', 'get', 'action', 'fan', 'little', 'giddy', 'However', 'initial', 'look', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'title', 'character', 'work', 'are', 'dumped', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'quite', 'dull', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'sad', 'attempt', 'development', 'plot', 'When', 'action', 'film', 'best', 'kung-foolery', 'little', 'silly', 'times', 'especially', 'fight', 'involving', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'bedsheets', 'are', 'plenty', 'villains', 'one', 'ultimate', 'baddie', 'Collectively', 'villains', 'are', 'known', 'Hand', ""'d"", 'love', 'have', 'seen', 'Elektra', 'go', 'Cary', 'Hiroyuki-Tagawa', 'character', 'who', 'really', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'wings', 'Instead', 'Garner', 'motley', 'crew', 'tattooed', 'warrior', 'chick', 'really', 'strong', 'breath', 'murdering', 'ninja', 'lightning-fast', 'moves', 'as', 'well', 'number', 'other', 'lesser', 'end', 'viewer', 'left', 'wondering', 'just', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'Why', 'was', 'Elektra', 'so', 'quick', 'protect', 'young', 'girl', 'father', 'had', 'clue', 'why', 'Hand', 'were', 'initially', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'finish', 'off', 'Hand', 'were', 'tracking', 'target', 'finished', 'many', 'off', 'quite', 'quickly', 'when', 'put', 'mind', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'questions', 'could', 'mention', 'may', 'reveal', 'too', 'much.In', 'closing', 'ho-hum', 'flick', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'intellectual', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'action', 'flick', 'What', 'end', 'up', 'fluffy', 'action', 'flick', 'almost', 'plot', 'development', 'zero', 'character', 'development', 'fact', 'film', 'had', 'advantage', 'other', 'first', 'films', 'comic', 'characters', 'need', 'develop', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'done', 'Daredevil', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'building', 'up', 'two', 'superheroes', 'one', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'comic', 'flicks', 'have', 'fight', 'initially', 'Elektra', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'use', 'advantage', 'Instead', 'played', 'out', 'was', 'looking', 'plot', 'least', 'good', 'reason', 'heroine', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'film.I', 'only', 'recommend', 'flick', 'purchase', 'hardcore', 'Elektra', 'fans', 'may', 'want', 'buy', 'are', 'completionist', 'just', 'have', 'have', 'Marvel', 'flick', 'DVD', 'Otherwise', ""'d"", 'rent', 'film', 'laying', 'cash', 'money', 'down', 'okay', 'are', 'plenty', 'better', 'comic', 'out', 'there', 'purchase']",N/A
885803,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0007P0Y7C,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 1]","Elektra brings the audience down the beaten path of the fight between good and evil.  The struggle between good and evil is an infamous theme in storytelling, as it teaches moral values that emphasize kindness, forgiveness, and compassion.  Despite being a frequently recurring theme, it has a solid value to its audience, as it provides new perspectives of the wolf in sheep's clothing and continues to foster goodness in people.  Elektra tries to offer such a lesson through a troubled woman, who still lives in the past, as anger clouds her thoughts.The good are represented by an organization led by the blind martial arts master Stick (Terence Stamp) who once taught the main character, Elektra (Jennifer Garner), to become a lethal killer that she is.  This might sound counter-productive, but the good side once tried to turn Elektra to one of their leading fighters against the ancient battle against evil.  This evil is led by Roshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) who is the leader of the feared organization called the Order of the Hand.  Yet, they are not as fearsome as one wishes in order to generate a suspenseful atmosphere.Once the audience settles down with the main theme, the film introduces a myriad of side plots.  For example, Elektra has a troubled past, her obsessive-compulsive disorder seems like a way of survival, her job is as a hired assassin, and other character's have secrets.  There is also the Hands' pursuit for warriors to tip the balance in their favor such as Elektra while puzzlement surrounds Stick's relationship to Elektra.  These are many of the plots provided in the film, which reminds the audience of a crossroads with several directions to choose.Unfortunately, the director does not develop these side plots or the characters. Instead, the filmmaker brings the audience through a rapid succession of images that are supposed to suggest ideas, thoughts, or something.  It feels as if much of the potpourri of thoughts diverges into a messy conundrum where much makes sense, but does not finish or offer any kind of message regarding how Elektra reaches her final solutions.  Much of it feels as if it is grabbed straight out of the air leaving the audience with a hollow and fabricated idea.  In addition, Elektra's choices occasionally seem to go against her character, and she does not seem to be the strong person that she is supposed to be.  This truly hurts the cinematic experience, as it does not provide a vision or meaning behind Elektra, the Hand, or others in the film.The films is nicely shot with some intriguing cinematography, yet some of it will remind the audience about films such as Hero (2002) and House of Flying Daggers (2004) by Yimou Zhang.  There is also a little of Matrix (1999) slow motion in the film, which does not provide any real unique experience.  Ultimately, Elektra will make the audience experience a trivial super hero film while the character Elektra deserves a much better developed story that does not feel cluttered, or borrowed.",2,Bowman does not capture the essence of Elektra...,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,3012,"['Elektra', 'audience', 'down', 'beaten', 'path', 'fight', 'good', 'evil', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'infamous', 'theme', 'storytelling', 'moral', 'values', 'emphasize', 'kindness', 'forgiveness', 'compassion', 'being', 'frequently', 'recurring', 'theme', 'solid', 'value', 'audience', 'new', 'perspectives', 'wolf', 'sheep', 'clothing', 'foster', 'goodness', 'people', 'Elektra', 'offer', 'such', 'lesson', 'troubled', 'woman', 'who', 'still', 'past', 'anger', 'thoughts.The', 'good', 'are', 'represented', 'organization', 'led', 'blind', 'martial', 'arts', 'master', 'Stick', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'who', 'once', 'taught', 'main', 'character', 'Elektra', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'become', 'lethal', 'killer', 'might', 'sound', 'counter-productive', 'good', 'side', 'once', 'tried', 'turn', 'Elektra', 'one', 'leading', 'fighters', 'ancient', 'battle', 'evil', 'evil', 'led', 'Roshi', 'Cary-Hiroyuki', 'Tagawa', 'who', 'leader', 'feared', 'organization', 'called', 'Order', 'Hand', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'fearsome', 'one', 'wishes', 'order', 'generate', 'suspenseful', 'atmosphere.Once', 'audience', 'down', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'myriad', 'side', 'plots', 'example', 'Elektra', 'troubled', 'past', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'way', 'survival', 'job', 'hired', 'assassin', 'other', 'character', 'have', 'secrets', 'also', 'Hands', 'pursuit', 'warriors', 'tip', 'balance', 'favor', 'such', 'Elektra', 'puzzlement', 'surrounds', 'Stick', 'relationship', 'Elektra', 'are', 'many', 'plots', 'provided', 'film', 'audience', 'crossroads', 'several', 'directions', 'choose.Unfortunately', 'director', 'not', 'develop', 'side', 'plots', 'characters', 'Instead', 'filmmaker', 'audience', 'rapid', 'succession', 'images', 'are', 'supposed', 'suggest', 'ideas', 'thoughts', 'something', 'much', 'potpourri', 'thoughts', 'diverges', 'messy', 'conundrum', 'where', 'much', 'sense', 'not', 'finish', 'offer', 'kind', 'message', 'regarding', 'how', 'Elektra', 'final', 'solutions', 'Much', 'grabbed', 'straight', 'air', 'leaving', 'audience', 'hollow', 'fabricated', 'idea', 'addition', 'Elektra', 'choices', 'occasionally', 'seem', 'go', 'character', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'strong', 'person', 'supposed', 'be', 'truly', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'not', 'provide', 'vision', 'meaning', 'Elektra', 'Hand', 'others', 'film.The', 'films', 'nicely', 'shot', 'intriguing', 'cinematography', 'will', 'remind', 'audience', 'films', 'such', 'Hero', '2002', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', '2004', 'Yimou', 'Zhang', 'also', 'little', 'Matrix', '1999', 'slow', 'motion', 'film', 'not', 'provide', 'real', 'unique', 'experience', 'Ultimately', 'Elektra', 'will', 'make', 'audience', 'experience', 'trivial', 'super', 'hero', 'film', 'character', 'Elektra', 'much', 'better', 'developed', 'story', 'not', 'feel', 'cluttered', 'borrowed']",N/A

Thankfully, DVD is a perfect place for fans and newcomers alike to discover Elektra.  The director's cut is a subtle and yet effective recut of Elektra.  I think that the theatrical release was disappointing to some because they were expecting a total action movie - more ""four color,"" and what they got was more of an emotional character study of Elektra.  The director's cut emphasizes this even more.  The commentary is very interesting - it reminded me of the Daredevil commentary.  It seems that directors often do not have the control that we might think they do over the movie, and Elektra was no exception.I thought this was very well done.

885817,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0007P0Y7C,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[25, 31]","I loved Daredevil, so much so that I have both the original release, and the director's cut on DVD. Hopefully, there will be a director's cut of this too, as many other reviewers have mentioned, there's a lot of stuff where it appears that scenes have been taken out.Elektra is a stand alone film, and you don't need to have seen Daredevil first before seeing this. There are flashbacks in this, but not to Daredevil, it references Elektra's mum dying when she was young, which wasn't mentioned in Daredevil. The only real reference to Daredevil is seeing Elektra's character coming back to life after being killed by Bullseye. Many people have said there should have been a reference to Daredevil, or a cameo by Ben Affleck. But the good thing about this movie is it stands alone. It would have changed the entire movie if Daredevil had been referenced. And as for a Ben Affleck cameo - hello people, can I mention that there are deleted scenes on the DVD?! Yes, Ben Affleck DOES have a cameo in the movie as Matt Murdoch, but it was quite rightly cut from the movie, as it probably would have ruined it, and puzzled viewers who hadn't seen Daredevil. It also hints that Elektra may return to Matt, which was also hinted at, at the end of Daredevil anyway. I hope she does. (And here was me getting worried, as while they were filming, Ben was on set, but spent a lot of time with Jennifer in her trailer, while he was still with Jennifer Lopez, the naughty boy - but they're now together!)Jennifer Garner is gorgeous, and even more so in this, than in some of her other movies. Of course, in this, she's wearing (for her assassin scenes anyway) a bright red, and very tight outfit. She's a guy's wet dream in this movie - and admitting in interviews that she couldn't wear any underwear sent the male viewers heads spinning! She is incredibly fit to have taken part in this movie, as she does a lot more fight scenes than she did for Daredevil. Yet her hair never moves while she's fighting, and it's very obviously extensions. Her makeup is perfect too, giving her the sculpted cheekbones look - you didn't really think that was real did you guys?! It takes work to get cheekbones like that! (Says she who doesn't have any!) I'm surprised there's not been rumours about Jen's lips, as they're very full lips, but they're all real, although at some points during her movies, they do come across as looking very fake. But look at Angelina Jolie, Steve Tyler, and that old guy from Rolling Stones, they're famous for their lips. Jennifer also has a great on-screen prescene, and she commands your attention from the first moment she appears. She's got something a lot of her peers don't.The cast are brilliant in this, with Goran Visnjic and Kirsten Prout performing well. Kirsten performs extremely well, even looking like Jennifer at some points, plus she's a ""prodigy"" as described during the movie. Look at this girl go! I found the bad guys extremely one-dimensional, and they could have done with some fleshing out. And for lethal assassins, Elektra has a pretty easy time killing them off. There's four of them in total: Tattoo (a guy who's tattoos quite literally come to life - I hope mine doesn't!), Stone (another guy who bears a striking resemblence to Michael Clarke Duncan, and the name says it all), Typhoid (who can kill with a single touch), and some other martial arts guy, who Elektra's met before, but doesn't really have any special abilities apart from being lightning fast. Especially for the guys there's a girl-on-girl between Elektra & Typhoid, when she tries to kill her. This was completely unnecessary, as it was shown earlier in the movie that Typhoid can kill with just her fingers, so why on earth did she kiss Jennifer (for ages might I add) to kill her?! I'm sorry, it wouldn't be a turn on to see two guys kiss, so why is it for two girls?!Due to the low level response from the previous film Daredevil, promotion for this movie claimed ties to the movie X-Men instead, which had a much higher popularity response. The first promotional mention of ties to the Daredevil movie only took place one week before the Elektra movie was to be released. There's a lot of X-Men in this movie actually, from kids trying to hide their special powers, to the special effects, and the bad guys, with their special powers. It all screams X-Men, which isn't such a bad thing, but it's missing a hunk like Wolverine! :)The film seems cut down a lot, which in an interview with UK's Empire Online, director Rob Bowman stated that the original director's cut was a R-rated film and he had to tone the film down (due to contractual obligations). So personally, I'm crossing my fingers for a director's cut of this. I feel, much like the director's cut of Daredevil, while adding to the film (although it took away the love scene between Jen & Ben), it slowed it down a lot, and the same for this as well. There's a lot of unnecessary scenes, and not enough time devoted to the bad guys. The 'romance' (and by romance, I mean a chaste peck) between Goran & Jennifer seems awkward almost, and you can't help but think of Matt. The OCD thing is also brilliant, organising everything, and counting while she walks.The extras are quite good and include: deleted scenes; a making-of; comic-con presentation; trailers, and inside the editing room, with Rob Bowman. There's also an inside look at Fox's next movies, Fantastic Four and Mr & Mrs Smith, both of which look excellent!I definitely think this film should be seen at least once, if not for the story (if you hated Daredevil, you'll love this or hate it) then for Jennifer herself. I'm sure there's plenty of guys tongues hanging out everywhere while watching this.Sweet dreams boys.",4,Much better than most people think,1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,5750,"['loved', 'Daredevil',

885827,A23FXW3H8FR789,B0007P0Y7C,Nathan D. Ludwig,"[9, 17]","Elektra is without a doubt one of the most disappointing comic book movies ever to be released. Daredevil is a classic compared to the Rob Bowman/Fox directorial failure here. In a year that has also seen a great comic book film like Batman Begins, (and to an extent Constantine) there's no excuse for Elektra at all...First of all, the entire movie's tone betrays the source material of the comics. Even Daredevil tried to be gritty and somewhat succeeded. Here, it's just a bunch of bad special effects, poor editing and even poorer martial arts coreography mixed together in a short, choppy and ultimately lifeless muddle of a movie. The 'real' Elektra stories in the comics were violent, dark and exciting. This should have been an all the way R-rated movie with plenty of violence and adult themes. The people who grew up on Elektra are old enough to care and actually pay to see an R movie. The box office success of such movies as Terminator 2, The Matrix Reloaded and others prove that if there is enough demand for a movie, people will see it no matter what it is rated...Throughout the entire movie, there is no sense of urgency whatsoever. One character gets killed off midway through the movie and no one cares because there is no emotion or logic behind it. The villains are beyond cardboard cutouts and completely uninteresting. Seeing Jennifer Garner in red leather is not enough to make up for ninety minutes of listless boredom.Garner, Terence Stamp and Goran Visnjic are all fine actors, but are wasted here in a meandering, uninteresting and extremely disappointing adaptation of one of the more popular figures in Marvel Comics. Like Wolverine and The Punisher, Elektra has a rabid following that would have surely made this movie a large success had it been made the way it deserved to be filmed. It's just sad to see potentially great comic book movies fall by the wayside due to lack of patience and/or disinterest for the actual source material. It just makes the intended audience feel insulted and cheated. Kind of like Alien Vs Predator, another ""gem"" from Fox, a studio quickly becoming unpopular with genre fans.Once again, Fox is trying to make a hollow attempt at amends by releasing an unrated cut of the movie. There's just one thing...A lackluster movie with a few extra lackluster scenes makes for an even more lackluster flick. Period. If you don't believe me, look at what a director's cut did for such classics as Highlander 2.

But in fairness I had to actually see it to believe it, because the suck level is beyond anything I could have imagined. Think about the producers of the second ""Charlie's Angels"" movie doing a remake of ""Enter the Dragon"" (with the Angels cast) and you get some idea of ""Elektra"". Wherever the $40 plus million budget ended up, it was not on the screen.Even from its inception the idea was suspect. Since ""Daredevil"" occupies pretty much the lowest rung on the superhero ladder, that makes ""Electra's"" status subterranean; they truly were scraping the bottom of the barrel. Add to this a really lame script (most cartoons have more subtle story lines and better dialog), uninteresting production design, poor lighting, and really bad direction and you can at least figure out why it is so bad.But that leaves the mystery of why a studio, whose goal is to make (not lose) money, ever gave a green-light to the project. In may be that since comic titles like ""Elektra"" are basically sexploitation, the money people looked at the casting of Jennifer Garner and Natassia Malthe and saw huge sexploitation potential. Unfortunately someone forgot to tell this to the director and the DP because the filming of the two actresses is totally sterile (and they wonder why this thing lost money).The movie's fight scenes suffer from ADD; each shot is a nanosecond long which negates any need for stunt work. choreography, or effects. There's even a showdown sequence where a bunch of laundry fights with the actors. At least this is original although it might have been used once in a ""Charlie Chan"" movie.Jennifer Garner looks confused most of the time. Like they did a lot of tight shots on her face in the studio and then cut them randomly into action footage produced by the second unit. These reaction shots just make her look totally clueless. I was  surprised by how old she looks, hard to believe she is only 33. She has clearly outgrown this type of role and I felt embarrassed for her.It seems inconceivable that ""anyone"" would find this entertaining although apparently a few people actually liked it.Then again, what do I know?

I saw it twice in theatres, yes after reading reviews and I loved it. I sat  waiting for it to ""start sucking"" and it never did. It was amazing.  Upon second viewing it reminded me a lot of  ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" but other than that (and the fact that it was too short) I felt that it was one of the best and most satisfying films I have seen in a long time.The movie involves Elektra who having died in Daredevil, is brought back to life. She is an assassin for hire. However her job as an assassin seems to be more due it's all she knows what to do, than any simple desire to kill.There is a wonderful scene near the beginning involving Elektra scrubbing the floor of her apartment. She claims she is doing it to get rid of her DNA. But one can really argue that she is doing so to get rid of her sins.The creators claimed that they have taken from Frank Miller. But personally I think they used the revamped version done by Greg Rucka.  Millers' Elektra was a bit of nut and a femme fetal. Rucka's Elektra was lucid woman but clearly a woman with issues. And in this movie we can see Elektra struggling with her  demons and trying to reconcile her past (like Xena).I felt that Garner did a lot better in this film than she did in Daredevil. While not conventionally attractive, her beauty shines through in her personality.As is evidenced by her starring role in ALIAS. The woman is clearly meant to take center stage. She should be playing second fiddle to no one. Especially not an actor like Ben Affleck.  She has a wonderful presence.Kristen  Prout  , as Abby is really terrific. She's so lovable as a bratty teenager. It's fascinating to watch her character develop as the movie progresses, and see how integral she is to the film.  And Goran Visnjic as Abby's father and Elektra's love interest. Was really good as well, he had a great ability to temper Elektra's restless and temperamental ways.The DVD contains 3 deleted scenes. Which were wisely left out. Two because they would have given away a major plot twist. And the third, with Affleck, because it would have looked cheesy.Anyway this is a great film.

Elektra died in ""Daredevil"", but she was brought back from the dead by the Masters. The problem is that now both sides, good and evil, seek her out. She is currently working as a gun-for-hire and is asked to go to an island and wait for instructions regarding her next mission. While she is waiting, she meets a father and daughter living in isolation and trying home-schooling. As soon as Elektra starts to get close to this people, she finds out that they are her target!Compared to ""Daredevil"", I would say that ""Elektra"" walks more into the fantastic side, with elements of future seeing, the use of animals to see distant events and other supernatural powers. In this sense, it is more in line with other Marvel comics, like X-Men. The action scenes are not at the level  of ""Daredevil"" though, which is a shame, since Jennifer Garner is the perfect choice for this type of scenes.Elektra has flashbacks from her childhood and we also get to see some of the events that developed between the time she was brought back from the dead and the current moment. This gives us some information that is helpful for understanding this character, but the development stops there.

885858,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B0007P0Y7C,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[6, 7]","One of the best, most exhilirating and purely Enjoyable movies around.  Admittedly it's not as plausible as some of the other comic book adaptations have managed to be (the ""X-Men"" movies and especially ""Batman Begins"", for example), requiring a couple of suspensions of disbelief here and there (though I'd contend that it comes off as more believable than, say, the James Bond or Rambo series).  That's not a putdown on those movies but they're not trying to be ultra-realistic, and neither is this.  What it is going for, and succeeds at much better than most action movies in my opinion, is to be a rocket ride with a plot and engaging characters.  It's sexy, it's intense at the right times, sweet and tender at the right times, mysterious at the right times, and explosive allout action at the right times, with a welcome romantic angle and with good humor without becoming an unfortunate self-parody.To be honset, it's not really accurate to the comic book version of Elektra (neither was her portrayal in ""Daredevil"") but that wasn't a fatal flaw with me like it would be with some other comic adaptations - the first four live-action ""Batman""s for example - five if you count the 60s one - were technically well done (uh, 3 of them were anyway.  The other 2 I felt missed the mark even on a technical level) but were disappointing because I wanted something far closer to the comics (and finally got it this summer!)  Elektra, on the other hand, I've read some of the books she's in and want to read more (I really must get around to the run of the series Greg Rucka wrote) but she's never been a personal favorite, and in fact I like this movie version of her quite a bit better.  Those who are really into the Elektra mythos from the comics the way I am with Batman or the Hulk or The Spectre or certain others may be disappointed by the differences.I knew next to nothing of the plot of this going into this and liked it this way, as almost everything was unexpected that way.  People have complained that it was a slow starter; I prefer that it took the time to build itself up.  I'm going to opt not to say too much about the storyline - the box description is deliberately vague and I think it was intentional that people not know where this was going to take them when they watch it (too many movies today, including some of the greatest, give away far too much in their previews) although that may have cost it at the box office.  Personally, I'm inclined to wonder if it's part of a trend where action movies with female protagonists aren't taken seriously.  Not many seem to do the same mega-business as the big budget action movies with bigname male stars.  It doesn't seem to be like that with other fields of movies - horror, comedy, drama, etc. - but action with a female on the marquee seems to be a bit of a hard sell lately.  I thought it was a very good change of pace to have the female be the central figure this time around, instead of the backup.  If I, for one, was in death-defying danger, personally I think Jennifer Garner in tight red leather would be a fine individual to come to the rescue.But as for who rescues who and who endangers who and what the sides are, not everything's immediately clear in this one.  There are some unexpected turns, and some great characters to take the those turns.  Speaking of characters, some of them I did recognize from the books, others I'm not sure if they were created for the movie or not.

But, I  rented it as part of a two-for-one deal at my local videostore and was glad I did.Is Elektra a great movie?  No.  But it's good.  Make no mistake, Batman Begins was a better film all the way around, but Elektra had similar elements, particularly in the back stories (both heroes lost parents when they were young, both were trained in ninjitsu and other martial arts.)  Elektra was a bit darker, for lack of a better term, than other Marvel comics-turned films such as The Hulk, X-Men or The Fantastic Four.In essence, Elektra is a martial arts film.  It has many asian elements and themes.  While many comic book superheroes acquire their powers by mutation, radiation or some other technological disaster or circumstance, Elektra's powers are mystical and learned, giving the story an eastern, not western, flavor.The action sequences are well done.  The scenes are nicely shot.  Very little of what takes place is so unbelievable as to be silly or ridiculous.

I place all blame on marvel who basically focused too much on setting up for the sequel and less on the action!!! This movie had so much potential but in the end it was barely amusing!!! If you want the truth the only reason I gave this movie 3 stars was because, of pitty and Jennifer Garner!!! It was a nobel effort but there are way better movies than this!!! The special features aren't that special either and not worth buying the movie over!!! Some hardcore Elektra fans will have a special place in their hearts for this movie!!! Don't buy this movie because of Jennifer Garner, if you want to see more of her just watch Alias/ or buy the first season!!! Marvel used to be about making comics and pleasing their main fan group, but now they have turned into a bunch of corporate business investors trying to make a profits!!

Spin-off or not, it doesn't matter, for if you have seen 'Alias' series, you know Ms. Garner has star quality, and that she can not only act, but do great action stunts herself.But ... oh dear, what happened?  Though Jennifer Garner's Elektra in sexy tight red costume is brought to life (thanks to her sensei Terence Stamp), the actions are not exciting as they should be, so-so at best, and the script is simply awful.  Tedious flashbacks showing Elektra's trauma as little girl?  Ninja-like villains whose mannerism is based psuedo-Japanese culture, and masterminds played by typecast Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Will Yun Lee?  I thought ninja characters are dead in Hollywood back in the 80s.Besides the lifeless characters surrounding Elektra, the martial arts action scenes are heavily cut and edited, so all you see in action parts is a series of short bits (like 2-5 seconds), or creepy animals created with CGIs.  It's the worst type of editing, too fast, too MTV-like.I find the unique team of the assassins -- Stone, Tattoo, Kinkou, Typhoid -- are very interesting (more so than Goran Visnjic and his daughter), and surely they could have provided exciting fight scenes, if pitted against Elektra effectively.  Well, they fight each other, Elektra and killers, but the fact is Rob Bowman fails to make good use of the assassins' abilities, and they vanish from the screen too quickly.  The only original thing about thrie fight is the deadly kiss -- of Elektra and Typhoid -- a sort of guilty pleasure.Maybe there is a director's cut somewhere in the vault of the studio.

The girl is physically fit and has the body and the moves but she is just a poor actress and does not fit the part of the Greek assassin. That said, Terrance Stamp is good as Stick her mentor but they do not portray him anything like the character in the comics. The character of Stick was a foul mouthed mentor who would as soon cuss Elektra or anybody out as look at them. They add Typhoid Mary, a really cool character and played by a beautiful actress, that wasn't even in the Elektra comics but in Daredevil. They also don't portray the character as she was written, a homocidal schizophrenic who is a mousey Mary and then turns into a crazy serial killer Typhoid who hates men. Stone, is portrayed as an indestructable hulk of a man but again they go against the comic by making him part of The Hand, the evil Ninja clan, when in the comic he was with Stick and The Chaste. Garner is just not right for the part. She doesn't have the look and the costume is weak.All that said, if you didn't read the comic you probably will at least find it an entertaining action flick on some level.

He also trained her to become a more powerful fighter, and she was stronger and better by the time she headed out on her own again. Jennifer Gardner is impressive, and it's obvious that she's done a lot of training for the title role this time.Elecktra is haunted by traumatic past events and she's depressed and isolated. She came across a Abby, a teenaged girl and her dad in an remote island where she lived. Abby is the ""treasure"" meaning she's a martial arts protegee, and is being pursued by The Hand, a group of powerful evil people with special black-magics. Stick and his team is also secretly trying to protect and take the girl in for training. While protecting the girl, Elecktra had no idea of her identity until much later when the girl started to fight the villians.The first half of this film is rather slow, and had very little fight scenes. The good battles are concentrated in the second  half, which had some good special effects. The villians all took their even share of screentime and fight scenes, and Elektra took on them on a at time. Terance Stamp is vastly underused in this movie, he didn't even have to do any fight scenes. Goran Visnjic(The Deep End) played Abby's father, and had love scenes with Elektra. His role was unfortunately underwritten and irrelevant to the story that he's best effort was not even working here.Even though Ben Affleck didn't make an appearance in the film, but he did have a deleted scene in the special feature.",3,Better than Daredevil.,1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,1630,"['Even', 'Elektra', 'had', 'died', 'Daredevil', 'already', 'here', 'revived', 'wise', 'powerful', 'Stick', 'martial', 'arts', 'specialist', 'played', 'Terance', 'Stamp', 'also', 'trained', 'become', 'more', 'powerful', 'fighter', 'was', 'stronger', 'better', 'time', 'headed', 'out', 'own', 'again', 'Jennifer', 'Gardner', 'impressive', 'obvious', 'done', 'lot', 'training', 'title', 'role', 'time.Elecktra', 'haunted', 'traumatic', 'past', 'events', 'depressed', 'isolated', 'came', 'Abby', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'dad', 'remote', 'island', 'where', 'lived', 'Abby', 'treasure', 'meaning', 'martial', 'arts', 'protegee', 'being', 'pursued', 'Hand', 'group', 'powerful', 'evil', 'people', 'special', 'black-magics', 'Stick', 'team', 'also', 'secretly', 'trying', 'protect', 'take', 'girl', 'training', 'protecting', 'girl', 'Elecktra', 'had', 'idea', 'identity', 'much', 'later', 'when', 'girl', 'started', 'fight', 'villians.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'rather', 'slow', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'fight', 'scenes', 'good', 'battles', 'are', 'concentrated', 'second', 'half', 'had', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'villians', 'took', 'even', 'share', 'screentime', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Elektra', 'took', 'time', 'Terance', 'Stamp', 'vastly', 'underused', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'do', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Goran', 'Visnjic', 'Deep', 'End', 'played', 'Abby', 'father', 'had', 'love', 'scenes', 'Elektra', 'role', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'underwritten', 'irrelevant', 'story', 'best', 'effort', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'working', 'here.Even', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'appearance', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'deleted', 'scene', 'special', 'feature']",N/A

It's all safe stuff. The ""action violence"" is quite bloodless, since vanquished bad guys vanish in a puff of smoke instead of bleeding all over the place. Garner's ""Elektra"" costume does good things for her figure and for 14-year-old boys, but still covers better than what you see at the beach.The plot moves along well. Elektra is hired to kill a man and his teen daughter. After meeting them, she decides not to finish the contract but to save them instead. Then the chase is on - and it turns out that Daddy and daughter are a bit more than Elektra signed up for. The whole assassination contract was a bit more than she signed up for, but you'll have to see that for yourself.The bad guys are OK, but sometimes uninspired. Typhoid, for example, has the super-power of fatally bad breath. Tattoo has (you guessed it) tattoos - but his tend to wander away. Then there's a guy whose evil super power seems to be in being big. Not super big, just big. Also, there's a lot of detail, but not all of it seems to serve the plot. The OCD thing - how does that explain anything we need to know? The flashbacks were generally good, but a few failed to move the plot forward.It's a good comic book movie, no matter what the critics said. If there had been fewer stray strands and bit stronger action, it might have been great. Still, it was good.//wiredweird",3,Passable comic adaptation,1113004800,"04 9, 2005",2005,1523,"['got', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', ""'d"", 'want', 'comic', 'adaptation', 'fair', 'fight/action', 'sequences', 'over-the-top', 'characters', 'effects', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'babe', 'appeal', 'safe', 'stuff', 'action', 'violence', 'quite', 'bloodless', 'vanquished', 'bad', 'guys', 'vanish', 'puff', 'smoke', 'instead', 'bleeding', 'place', 'Garner', 'Elektra', 'costume', 'good', 'things', 'figure', '14-year-old', 'boys', 'still', 'better', 'what', 'see', 'beach.The', 'plot', 'moves', 'along', 'well', 'Elektra', 'hired', 'kill', 'man', 'teen', 'daughter', 'meeting', 'not', 'finish', 'contract', 'save', 'instead', 'Then', 'chase', 'out', 'Daddy', 'daughter', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'Elektra', 'signed', 'up', 'whole', 'assassination', 'contract', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'signed', 'up', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'yourself.The', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'OK', 'sometimes', 'uninspired', 'Typhoid', 'example', 'super-power', 'fatally', 'bad', 'breath', 'Tattoo', 'guessed', 'tend', 'wander', 'away', 'Then', 'guy', 'evil', 'super', 'power', 'be', 'being', 'big', 'Not', 'super', 'big', 'just', 'big', 'Also', 'lot', 'detail', 'not', 'serve', 'plot', 'OCD', 'thing', 'how', 'explain', 'anything', 'need', 'know', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'generally', 'good', 'few', 'failed', 'move', 'plot', 'forward.It', 'good', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'matter', 'what', 'critics', 'said', 'had', 'been', 'fewer', 'stray', 'strands', 'bit', 'stronger', 'action', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'Still', 'was', 'good.//wiredweird']",N/A
