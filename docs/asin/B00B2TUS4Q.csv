This post reflects my honest, personal opinion and experience with the product which may differ from yours. Product information courtesy of the sponsor. No monetary compensation was provided for this post.My Thoughts-What excited me to first agree to review ""Break Away"" was the fact it had cycling in it and was a Christian movie. Now after watching it, I'm even more excited to share about this DVD with you.Francois is a family man and a business man. But with the recession he loosing his job, along with his co-workers. He doesn't share this information with his family right away, he tries very hard to fix the problem and make money some other way. But things just weren't working out and soon he found himself riding his bike making deliveries for other companies. His wife is upset with him at first for not sharing this problem with her but soon through prayer, she becomes very supportive.Francois meets a man named, Eli. He owns a bicycle shop and helps makes Francois' bike fast for fast deliveries and so he can race these guys he sees very day on the road. Eli and Francois become very close friends and find out each of them are Christian. Eli tries to encourage Francois in his situation by sharing the story of the ""5 loaves and 2 fish"" story of Jesus. He doesn't get it at first but by the end of the movie you can see how God took what little Francois had and changed his life and the lives of those around him.I really enjoyed this movie. It's perfect for all Churches and Christian homes. I would not only categorize it as a Christian Sports film but a good, fun family film. The movie takes place in South Africa, most of the time it's filmed in English but other times it's spoken in another language that they close caption for us.One part of the movie Francois is training very hard to win this bicycle tournament. Eli is helping train him and asks, ""Why is it so important for you to win?"". Francois replies ""I'm tired of people telling me what is not possible. With God all things are possible."" This would be what I think the main theme of the whole movie is, the purpose of this film. It's to tell us to not give up, to trust in God, even in the toughest times.I want to share this story with you. Lately life for my family has been tough, with Moo being diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and with me dealing with kidney stones while being pregnant. The other day I ended up in the hospital with the worst kidney stone pain I have ever had, even pain meds weren't helping. I started praying and then singing the song ""How Great Thou Art"". It was my mentor's favorite song and I was clinging to it with hope in God. Towards the end of ""Break Away"" a hymn is being sung in another language. I had to stop the movie, it was ""How Great Thou Art"". It hit me hard, I know God is with me. And I find it no coincidence that I happen to watch this movie on the same day I struggled in the hospital. Thank you God.The movie ends with the scripture from Jeremiah 29:11 and I want to end my review with the same.""For I know the plans I have for you,"" declares the Lord, ""plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.""",5,Heart touching movie,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,3258,"['*', 'Disclaimer', '/', 'Disclosure', 'received', 'free', 'sample', 'Word', 'Films', 'facilitate', 'review', 'post', 'honest', 'personal', 'opinion', 'experience', 'product', 'may', 'differ', 'yours', 'Product', 'information', 'courtesy', 'sponsor', 'monetary', 'compensation', 'was', 'provided', 'post.My', 'Thoughts-What', 'excited', 'first', 'agree', 'review', 'Break', 'Away', 'was', 'fact', 'had', 'cycling', 'was', 'Christian', 'movie', 'Now', 'watching', ""'m"", 'even', 'more', 'excited', 'share', 'DVD', 'you.Francois', 'family', 'man', 'business', 'man', 'recession', 'loosing', 'job', 'co-workers', ""n't"", 'share', 'information', 'family', 'right', 'away', 'very', 'hard', 'fix', 'problem', 'make', 'money', 'other', 'way', 'things', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'working', 'out', 'soon', 'found', 'riding', 'bike', 'making', 'deliveries', 'other', 'companies', 'wife', 'upset', 'first', 'not', 'sharing', 'problem', 'soon', 'prayer', 'very', 'supportive.Francois', 'meets', 'man', 'named', 'Eli', 'bicycle', 'shop', 'Francois', 'bike', 'fast', 'fast', 'deliveries', 'so', 'can', 'race', 'guys', 'very', 'day', 'road', 'Eli', 'Francois', 'become', 'very', 'close', 'friends', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'Christian', 'Eli', 'encourage', 'Francois', 'situation', 'sharing', 'story', '5', 'loaves', '2', 'fish', 'story', 'Jesus', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'end', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'God', 'took', 'what', 'little', 'Francois', 'had', 'changed', 'life', 'lives', 'him.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'perfect', 'Churches', 'Christian', 'homes', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'categorize', 'Christian', 'Sports', 'film', 'good', 'fun', 'family', 'film', 'movie', 'place', 'South', 'Africa', 'most', 'time', 'filmed', 'English', 'other', 'times', 'spoken', 'language', 'close', 'caption', 'us.One', 'part', 'movie', 'Francois', 'training', 'very', 'hard', 'win', 'bicycle', 'tournament', 'Eli', 'helping', 'train', 'asks', 'Why', 'so', 'important', 'win', 'Francois', ""'m"", 'tired', 'people', 'telling', 'what', 'not', 'possible', 'God', 'things', 'are', 'possible', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'think', 'main', 'theme', 'whole', 'movie', 'purpose', 'film', 'tell', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'trust', 'God', 'even', 'toughest', 'times.I', 'want', 'share', 'story', 'Lately', 'life', 'family', 'been', 'tough', 'Moo', 'being', 'diagnosed', 'Type', '1', 'Diabetes', 'dealing', 'kidney', 'stones', 'being', 'pregnant', 'other', 'day', 'ended', 'up', 'hospital', 'worst', 'kidney', 'stone', 'pain', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'even', 'pain', 'meds', 'were', ""n't"", 'helping', 'started', 'praying', 'then', 'singing', 'song', 'How', 'Great', 'Thou', 'Art', 'was', 'mentor', 'favorite', 'song', 'was', 'clinging', 'hope', 'God', 'end', 'Break', 'Away', 'hymn', 'being', 'sung', 'language', 'had', 'stop', 'movie', 'was', 'How', 'Great', 'Thou', 'Art', 'hit', 'hard', 'know', 'God', 'find', 'coincidence', 'happen', 'watch', 'movie', 'same', 'day', 'struggled', 'hospital', 'Thank', 'God.The', 'movie', 'scripture', 'Jeremiah', '29:11', 'want', 'end', 'review', 'same', 'know', 'plans', 'have', 'Lord', 'plans', 'prosper', 'not', 'harm', 'give', 'hope', 'future']",Break Away
1621346,A385SBEEJ15HHJ,B00B2TUS4Q,Cindy Navarro,"[1, 1]","Written and directed by stars Frans Cronje and Morne Theunissen, this is one of those films that can make a powerful impact. There were a couple of things that did bother me with the dvd, though. First was my initial difficulty in understanding some of the accents, so I really wish closed captioning had been an option. I did adapt, and it got easier, but it was still a stumbling block. The second was some sound issues. There was one spot in particular where the sound of people walking overpowered the voices, so the film definitely needed some ADR work.However, this is also one of the more powerful films I have seen about relying on God through the tough times. Using the parable of the loaves and the fishes, there is a message to give God all you have and see what He does with it. In one scene, his wife (Leone Pienaar) tells him that he is to follow God, and she and the children would follow him. While he did go through moments of despair, Francois takes what is available for him to use---including his talents---and simply gives his best and relies on God to see him through. This is an excellent testimony on trusting God to provide for your needs and adapting to His plan, no matter how it looks to others.The soundtrack was better than average for me. There were a couple of songs I wasn't fond of, but I loved the majority of the music--there is a version of ""How Great Thou Art"" that is outstanding! I was also impressed with the partnership the film has with Jacob's Well. This is a ministry that aims to build up a growing network of churches, organizations, businesses and individuals working together to help people in their communities who have lost regular income or do not have a self-sustainable income.I received this movie free from Word Films as part of their Blogger Review Program, via Blogger Gateway.

Namely his ex-con brother and humorous bicycle shop owner.This is definitely an all ages,  family-friendly film.  My kids really enjoyed the accents and scenery.  My husband noted that there were a few parts that moved a bit slow for his taste.  Though some of my ultra conservative friends probably won't appreciate the few shots of a shirtless Francois, the rest of the movie sends a positive, entertaining, inspiring and uplifting message!",5,What do you do with only five loaves and two fish?,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,1071,"['What', 'do', 'do', 'only', 'five', 'loaves', 'two', 'fish', 'give', 'Jesus', 'watch', 'what', 'HE', 'will', 'do', 'them.Break', 'Away', 'inspirational', 'story', 'how', 'God', 'can', 'use', 'hard', 'situation', 'good', 'glory.Set', 'South', 'Africa', 'movie', 'Francois', 'who', 'husband', 'father', 'business', 'man', 'loosing', 'job', 'entire', 'department.Though', 'gallant', 'effort', 'take', 'care', 'now', 'unemployed', 'co-workers', 'recession', 'jobs', 'are', 'scarce.Through', 'misgiving', 'Francois', 'how', 'God', 'can', 'turn', 'what', 'little', 'left', 'blessing', 'literally', 'life', 'Namely', 'ex-con', 'brother', 'humorous', 'bicycle', 'shop', 'owner.This', 'definitely', 'ages', 'family-friendly', 'film', 'kids', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'accents', 'scenery', 'husband', 'noted', 'were', 'few', 'parts', 'moved', 'bit', 'slow', 'taste', 'ultra', 'conservative', 'friends', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'few', 'shots', 'shirtless', 'Francois', 'rest', 'movie', 'positive', 'entertaining', 'inspiring', 'uplifting', 'message']",Break Away
1621348,A3SD3E6FIS6CS9,B00B2TUS4Q,Marine Corps Nomad,"[0, 0]","Break Away, released previously in Afrikaans as Baroudeur, is a film about faith, family, friends, and perseverance. Unlike Baroudeur, Break Away is almost completely in English; there are some subtitles. It takes place in Cape Town, South Africa. This is where one of the problems with the movie comes into play. The actors' accents are very thick, so it is difficult to understand them. My daughter also said they didn't pronounce their words clearly enough which means the words sounded a bit like mumbling to her at times. The other issue, which compounded the accent issue, was that the audio was not consistent. At times, the soundtrack was too loud, so it overpowered the voice track. Other times, the voices had a ""tin"" sound to them. So, the audio and accents did make following the movie a bit more difficult.That being said, the story line and the message were very good. It showed the importance of having faith in God, having a strong family unit, and having the support of friends during difficult times. The movie focused on the fact that all things are possible with Christ. What we liked is that it showed that our wishes and plans for our life are not necessarily God's plans for our lives. Sometimes we really want one thing, but the Lord knows that we need something else. It doesn't always work out the way we want it to, but the Lord supplies for our needs.We enjoyed the soundtrack and believe it added to the overall feel of the movie. The movie is very clean with no objectionable material, and it would be suitable for all ages.A special thanks to Word Films for sending me a review copy to preview which allowed me to write this review based upon our experiences with the movie. Based upon my family's experience with the movie, we rate it 3.5 stars.

1621350,A30X9M0J5WOVAS,B00B2TUS4Q,The IEMommy,"[0, 0]","I had a little bit of a hard time getting into Break Away, I think because of the thick accents I had trouble understanding, but by the end I was completely engrossed in this inspiring movie and immediately watched it again to pick up what I missed.The movie takes place in South Africa and when Francois' loses his job, he faces the hardship of providing for his family with no income; a scenario all too familiar with many Americans today. When none of his interviews pan out, he stumbles upon a chance to make some quick cash making a delivery on his bicycle. One opportunity turns into another and he suddenly finds himself a full time delivery man.It was really inspirational to see a hard working man humbled to what could be considered a lowly position reserved for teenagers and find joy in it. As Christians we are called to find joy in all that we do and serve the Lord regardless of the stature of the work itself. Francois' was a shining example of this.One of my favorite parts of the film was the music. Music is such an important element in a movie. It can make or break it depending on how it's done. The music was so appropriate to not only set the tone but also to tie in the message with the lyrics.I was shocked after I watched the movie to read that the movie was made by a crew of just 7 professionals and 15 students and volunteers! I could tell this obviously wasn't a big studio blockbuster but what was accomplished was incredible on a tight budget with such a small crew. They obviously had a heart and commitment for the film and getting the message across was their priority, not making millions. Even more inspirational: it was based on actual events.Break Away was a total inspiration and great example of a Godly man doing God's work, no matter how big or small.",4,Redefining Dreams,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1794,"['had', 'little', 'bit', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'Break', 'Away', 'think', 'thick', 'accents', 'had', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'end', 'was', 'completely', 'engrossed', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'immediately', 'watched', 'again', 'pick', 'up', 'what', 'missed.The', 'movie', 'place', 'South', 'Africa', 'when', 'Francois', 'job', 'hardship', 'providing', 'family', 'income', 'scenario', 'too', 'familiar', 'many', 'Americans', 'today', 'When', 'none', 'interviews', 'pan', 'out', 'chance', 'make', 'quick', 'cash', 'making', 'delivery', 'bicycle', 'One', 'opportunity', 'suddenly', 'full', 'time', 'delivery', 'man.It', 'was', 'really', 'inspirational', 'see', 'hard', 'working', 'man', 'humbled', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'lowly', 'position', 'reserved', 'teenagers', 'find', 'joy', 'Christians', 'are', 'called', 'find', 'joy', 'do', 'serve', 'Lord', 'regardless', 'stature', 'work', 'Francois', 'was', 'shining', 'example', 'this.One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'film', 'was', 'music', 'Music', 'such', 'important', 'element', 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'depending', 'how', 'done', 'music', 'was', 'so', 'appropriate', 'not', 'only', 'set', 'tone', 'also', 'tie', 'message', 'lyrics.I', 'was', 'shocked', 'watched', 'movie', 'read', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'crew', 'just', '7', 'professionals', '15', 'students', 'volunteers', 'could', 'tell', 'obviously', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'studio', 'blockbuster', 'what', 'was', 'accomplished', 'was', 'incredible', 'tight', 'budget', 'small', 'crew', 'obviously', 'had', 'heart', 'commitment', 'film', 'getting', 'message', 'across', 'was', 'priority', 'not', 'making', 'millions', 'Even', 'more', 'inspirational', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'events.Break', 'Away', 'was', 'total', 'inspiration', 'great', 'example', 'Godly', 'man', 'doing', 'God', 'work', 'matter', 'how', 'big', 'small']",Break Away
