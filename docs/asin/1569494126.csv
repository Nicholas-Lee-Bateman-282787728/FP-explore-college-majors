I know that 2 weeks prior to this I stopped talking to at the time my best friend as he wanted me to break into a abandoned house.

To say that this 2-disc set is definitive is to do injustice to the word ""definitive."" EVERYTHING you would ever want to know about Schoolhouse Rock is here. All forty-six cartoons ever done for the series are included, even the ""Scooter Computer and Mr. Chips"" series that looked at computers. The electoral college toon that was done later is part of this collection, too.The extras on the second disc are outstanding. In addition to Scooter Computer and the rarely seen ""The Weather Show,"" you get a behind the scenes look at the electoral college song, a Top 20 countdown of the best in the series, a puzzle game that features the songs, four music videos of the songs arranged by contemporary pop/rock groups, a feature on the Emmy Awards won by the series, commentary by the creators, and more.The navigation design of the DVD is superb. Only want to see the ""Multiplication Rock"" or ""America Rock"" toons? You can select the specific series you want, play all within a series, or pick each specific toon from a series. You can also choose to play all forty-six toons or just the ones chosen by fans as the top ones. There's a built-in shuffle feature as well. Every DVD should be this easy to navigate and use.Even the booklet that comes with this edition is helpful. The lyrics for the top ten toons are included as is the history of Schoolhouse Rock. A chapter breakdown is included at the end of the booklet.Schoolhouse Rock is virtually impervious to review due to its unbiquitous nature within a whole generation or two of Americans. The cleverness of the animation enlivens the topic discussed, not to mention holding the attention of young children. The songs are exceptionally catchy; I'm still amazed at how they managed to do such a great job marrying the Preamble of the Constitution with a hummable melody. Definitely a reflection of the musical styles of the day, songs like ""Verb: That's What's Happening"" (done in the style of the soundtrack of ""Shaft"") or ""The Preamble"" (70s Folk/Rock) capture the era perfectly. It makes those of us who grew up in those days misty-eyed for a return of that AM radio sound to today's music.If you have kids (or are just nostalgic at heart), this DVD is essential. I'm using it as homeschool material for our kids. When my son sings the songs, it's great to know another generation will appreciate the merits of Schoolhouse Rock. No question, this 30th anniversary edition of Schoolhouse Rock is truly worthy of five stars.",5,Part of the American Consciousness,1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,2934,"['Schoolhouse', 'Rock', 'unusual', 'American', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'Nearly', 'person', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'late', 'Sixties', 'familiar', 'series', 'How', 'ubiquitous', 'would', 'predict', 'started', 'humming', 'Conjunction', 'Junction', ""'m"", 'Just', 'Bill', 'Three', 'Magic', 'Number', 'room', 'dozen', 'people', 'three-quarters', 'would', 'know', 'reference', 'least', 'couple', 'would', 'probably', 'join', 'humming', 'singing', 'words.This', 'unimpeachable', 'stuff', 'say', '2-disc', 'set', 'definitive', 'do', 'injustice', 'word', 'definitive', 'EVERYTHING', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'know', 'Schoolhouse', 'Rock', 'here', 'forty-six', 'cartoons', 'ever', 'done', 'series', 'are', 'included', 'even', 'Scooter', 'Computer', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'series', 'looked', 'computers', 'electoral', 'college', 'toon', 'was', 'done', 'later', 'part', 'collection', 'too.The', 'extras', 'second', 'disc', 'are', 'outstanding', 'addition', 'Scooter', 'Computer', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Weather', 'Show', 'get', 'scenes', 'look', 'electoral', 'college', 'song', 'Top', '20', 'countdown', 'best', 'series', 'puzzle', 'game', 'songs', 'four', 'music', 'videos', 'songs', 'arranged', 'contemporary', 'pop/rock', 'groups', 'feature', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'won', 'series', 'commentary', 'creators', 'more.The', 'navigation', 'design', 'DVD', 'superb', 'Only', 'want', 'see', 'Multiplication', 'Rock', 'America', 'Rock', 'toons', 'can', 'select', 'specific', 'series', 'want', 'play', 'series', 'pick', 'specific', 'toon', 'series', 'can', 'also', 'choose', 'play', 'forty-six', 'toons', 'just', 'ones', 'chosen', 'fans', 'top', 'ones', 'built-in', 'shuffle', 'feature', 'well', 'Every', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'easy', 'navigate', 'use.Even', 'booklet', 'edition', 'helpful', 'lyrics', 'top', 'ten', 'toons', 'are', 'included', 'history', 'Schoolhouse', 'Rock', 'A', 'chapter', 'breakdown', 'included', 'end', 'booklet.Schoolhouse', 'Rock', 'virtually', 'impervious', 'review', 'due', 'unbiquitous', 'nature', 'whole', 'generation', 'two', 'Americans', 'cleverness', 'animation', 'topic', 'discussed', 'not', 'mention', 'holding', 'attention', 'young', 'children', 'songs', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'catchy', ""'m"", 'still', 'amazed', 'how', 'managed', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'marrying', 'Preamble', 'Constitution', 'hummable', 'melody', 'Definitely', 'reflection', 'musical', 'styles', 'day', 'songs', 'Verb', 'What', 'Happening', 'done', 'style', 'soundtrack', 'Shaft', 'Preamble', '70s', 'Folk/Rock', 'capture', 'era', 'perfectly', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'days', 'misty-eyed', 'return', 'AM', 'radio', 'sound', 'today', 'music.If', 'have', 'kids', 'are', 'just', 'nostalgic', 'heart', 'DVD', 'essential', ""'m"", 'using', 'homeschool', 'material', 'kids', 'When', 'son', 'songs', 'great', 'know', 'generation', 'will', 'appreciate', 'merits', 'Schoolhouse', 'Rock', 'question', '30th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'Schoolhouse', 'Rock', 'truly', 'worthy', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

You go right to the good stuff.You know them, you loved them as a kid and if you actually remembered much of America Rock or Science Rock, you'd get a few Jeopardy questions the contestants miss. All the three-minute classics are here from the 1970s plus a couple that were done in the 1980s plus Money Rock, a series that appears to have been done in the 1990s PLUS a brand new Schoolhouse Rock on the electoral college. That's dual tasks as homage and lesson -- the son of one of the original animators worked on it and Jack Sheldon, the voice behind Conjunction Junction and I'm Just a Bill, sings on it.So what we've got here is one DVD set I'll call ""splendid"" if I may unpack an adjective. One little thing I love, just for the change of pace, is the slowed electronic piano version of ""Lolly, Lolly, Lolly"" that plays when you're at the second menu on the disc. Something about it seems to match the wistfully nostaligic feel I get watching these (and I had this disc BEFORE my daughter came along).What's missing? Commentary by the creators. I'm a commentary junkie. To me, a dream summer is me spending every day doing nothing but sipping Long Island iced teas and watching director's/writer's/actors commentaries on my favorite movies and TV shows.OK, some of the Schoolhouse Rock creators have died, but those alive surely have some interesting stories about how they came up with these marvelous tunes and how they were able to get established artists such as Sheldon and Blossom Dearie (Figure Eight, Unpack Your Adjectives) into working with them.Also, while there's a Top Ten Jukebox, with the 10 greatest Schoolhouse Rock songs as chosen by an online poll, that's the only place you can really program songs to play in a particular order. The book with the DVD set has the lyrics only of these 10 songs. That's also where you get the only creator commentary, a brief Q&A; with George Newell.So it's missing. I'll live without it.

Only a few of these videos, such as The Checks in the Mail, may soon altogether lose their frame of reference, but the majority remain relevant and should remain relevant for many a decade more. Some of the images could be considered to portray negative stereotypes but the overwhelming spirit of this work is positive and encourages good discussions among children, parents and teachers. Some of the Christian and Islamic references (gospel music, Noah's ark, polygamy, etc.) may seem more sensitive topics by today's standards, but the overall impression is one of acceptance, family values and individual self-esteem.I admit nostalgia in purchasing these videos as much as a desire to teach my children, still, these decades' old cartoon music videos remain effect tools in teaching simple but important concepts. There are elementary lessons in grammar, multiplication, American independence and expansion, health and hygiene, basic government and money management, civil rights, etc. put to many musical styles such as soul, gospel, jazz, blues, folk, etc. The lyrics are clever, original and memorable, the music catchy and the messages are on-point. This is superior craftsmanship that is much more than retuning nursery rhymes. Best of all is that the CHILDREN `get it'!This collection contains two DVD's. The first contains reproductions of all the original music videos for all the original categories but with limited interaction and lesson. The second disk provides interactive activities. Some mouse functionality/interactivity failed after a short while requiring tab/enter to run programs.

These great animated shorts helped kids learn multiplication, science, grammar, american history and money. You want an explanation of our national debt? - watch Tyrannosaurus Debt :-).The first DVD has all the original shorts categorized by groups, you can play them by group, or play them all in order or play them all or shuffle.  If you choose a particular group, you can pick the ones you want to play in the playlist or select the Play All button.  I was having a blast seeing remembering how many of these I could still sing.The 2nd DVD is the Extra Credit portion of the set.  You can watch with Captions or Audio Commentary.  I really had fun with the ""Earn Your Diploma"" Trivia and the Arrange A Schoolhouse Rock song.  The Earn Your Diploma gives you a set of questions to answer to each group (Science, Money, etc).  When you get them all right, you get a clue which when you solve all the groups you can then solve the Master Jumble to become a Schoolhouse Rock Graduate.  The Arrange A Schoolhouse Rock Song has 3 of the Schoolhouse rock songs mixed up and its up to you to get the lyrics in order.  When you get them right, the song clip will play.  The music videos section was funny - the first 3 had the original animated shorts but the music/voices were redone by Better Than Ezra (""Conjunction Junction""), Lemonheads(""My Hero Zero"") and Deluxe Folk Implosion(""I'm Just A Bill"").  I didn't care for the last one by Goodness (""Electricity, Electricity"").

There is also a plus of having jazz performers Blossom Dearie and Grady Tate and future Broadway writers like Lynn Ahrens performing the scores (rock in the title is a bit of a misnomer.)Thirty years later, the songs are still hummable (Figure 8 is a beautiful song for all ages) and the lessons still apply. I bought this set for my 5 and 8 year old cousins and they love it. They're also ahead of their class in English and Math and I'm sure this set has something to do with it.

These songs helped to define our generation, and you could probably pick any random young adult, and he would be able to hum or any sing one of these tunes!  I am SO glad that schoolhouse rock is out on DVD. I have the VHS tapes from a decade ago, but it's nice to have all the songs (49 total, just about) together. Some of my favorites were Conjunction Junction, Interplanet Janet, Sufferin' Till Suffrage, Elbow Room, Figure Eight, I'm Just a Bill, The Preamble (I can still recite the US Constitution's preamble thanks to this!), A Noun is a Person/Place/Thing, Shot Heard around the World, and A Victim of Gravity. Everyone will have their own favorites!The DVD is a 2DVD set. The 1st one has 49 songs, which can be listened to individually, by subject matter, and all together. You can even choose up to 10 songs (or repeat a few) to be played. My favorite method is the random jukebox, which plays random songs - you never know what's going to be played next, just like on the old ABC saturday morning cartoon days. The 2nd DVD has a ""lost"" song, a new song, 3 forgotten computer songs, a few featurettes, commentaries on a bunch of songs. There's also a trivia game - kinda fun, and it unlocks a mini-song. Also a few fun easter eggs around. All in all, it's a fun disc to look over, and the kids will like it, too. There's even a top 20 songs shuffle count-down, too.I'm glad I have this DVD.

185423,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,1569494126,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","Until recently cartoons were largely created for children and confined to Saturday mornings.  In the 1970s, ABC television network developed a series of educational shorts that were sponsored by major advertisers.  Known as SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK!, the series consisted of three-minute cartoons that described multiplication, grammar, and American history and government.  In the late 1970s another set of shorts about science was added; still more came in the 1990s and after 2000.The most famous of these shorts are the originals, which are unexpectedly clever.  Each short is set to music and the lyrics are easy to remember, and anyone who grew up in the 1970s should recall most of them and have their own favorites.  The multiplication shorts are perhaps the least memorable of the original--there's only so much you can do with the multiplication tables--but ""Naughty Number Nine"" and ""Little Twelvetoes"" are surprisingly entertaining.  The grammar shorts include several very famous titles, such as ""Conjunction Junction,"" and (inspired by the looming bicentennial) American history pops with everything from the Preamble to Sufferage.One of the most interesting things about the series is that it shows us how we have changed since the shorts aired.  Pluto is described as a planet; the nervous system is described as telegraph wires.  The videos strive to be inclusive, but the only minority that receives significant play is African American; at least one character smokes; and the whole thing has a distinctly Judeo-Christian slant.  The music itself is also of the period, and whether blues or folk or rock, the entire thing has a distinctly New York funky feel.The collection does not include everything produced under the SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK! banner--there's nothing from the ""Earth Rock"" series and a number of individual titles (usually the more recent ones) are left out.  Whatever the case, it's certainly fun to revisit these shorts--but when they are played back to back they become somewhat wearing.  SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK is probably best viewed in small chunks.  I'm not sure how often adults will return to the collection, and it's difficult to know how modern kids will take it, whether they will mentally tune in or out.  Even so, it's enjoyable, if only as nostalgia.

On this first disc is all the SHR songs ever aired as well as a choosing to play all the math ones, or all the grammar ones, etc. You can also choose to play all the songs. However, the songs will play in the order of type, though, not in order of their air date. It's not that big of a complaint for me, though. I personally liked playing them individually, but if you're ever in the mood to play a series of songs, then there's always that option, too. And to answer the other complaint of one of the spotlight reviews, you can easily skip over the trailers by hitting the ""menu"" button on your DVD remote.The second disc has a ton of specials, such as the collection of the not as well known ""Scooter Computer and Mr. Chips"" episodes, a Nike commercial featuring music from ""3 is a Magic Number"" and new animation when pressing on random things on the menu screen like the water faucet or light switch. There's also the latest SHR song about the electoral voting system.The only major complaint I can think of is ""how come the footage wasn't remastered?"" Disney's been releasing their older movies remastered, so you think they'd do the same with this series as well. Regardless, the music videos are still watchable, but you can definitely tell that they could have been improved upon, especially when comparing the brightness with the later ""money rock"" songs.As for how effective the songs are to viewers, I still think this was one of the best ways I was able to learn about some stuff way back when. But the key factor for how effective this stuff will be to your kids all depends on what they're interested in.

You get all 46 Schoolhouse Rock songs here, including the long lost song ""The Weather Show"".  These songs are wonderful, charming, tuneful, and simply gorgeous.  Unlike most current children's programming, which is incredibly dumbed down, this series isn't.  Adults can watch it and appreciate it just as much as kids can.  It doesn't talk down to children.  Children are not as dumb as people think they are.  It doesn't have that overly commercial feel that a lot of programming does today.  I love seeing and hearing Three is a Magic Number, the adverb song, the noun song, pronouns, telegraph line, etc., etc..

Why is this list on disc 2 and not on disc 1 as a play list option? There are also some fairly interesting (but not too revealing) commentaries for a couple of handfuls of tunes on disc 2. Why are these commentaries not on disc 1, and why not for all of the songs? Only 3 of the original 4 Scooter Computer songs are included, and the long-lost ""Weather Show"" is obviously edited. A history of the failed Scooter Computer series would have been nice, as would an explanation of why the ""Weather Show"" was pulled from circulation and then edited for this release.

185445,ADEETJWRKD6OA,1569494126,"J. Moran ""aralim""","[5, 5]","This is a great DVD containing all of the original songs we grew up with during our Saturday morning cartoon days. It's just as entertaining and catchy as it was in the early 70's, and if my daughter's any indication even children as young as 2 will find it enjoyable.What surprised me when I saw the list of songs was that there were many that I had never seen. In particular, all seven money songs didn't get on the air before I stopped watching cartoons, so there was actually new stuff (from my perspective, anyway ;-D).You can play the songs in a few ways. First, you can go to the Play List and select songs by their group -- grammar, science, history, money, multiplication. There's also an option called ""The Whole Enchilada"" which will play all 46 songs. Depending on the style you choose (""mild"" or ""spicy""), the songs either play back in order by group or in a random shuffle.There's also an option called ""Jukebox"", but this was deceptive. Instead of letting you pick any set of songs you want, you can only pick from the top ten songs (as determined by the publisher based on viewer feedback from years ago).My daughter just turned two in September, and she loves to watch the Grammar Rock set. Within two days of seeing it, she was singing the chorus of ""Interjections!"" (as well as a two-year old can sing, that is ;D). I don't know if it's mainly due to this or just the rate her language skills are naturally developing, but her use of pronouns has greatly improved in the last couple of months and that song is another of her favorites in the Grammar set.The other sections are moderately advanced for her age (especially multiplication rock and money rock), so she's not so interested in those yet. Surprisingly, she loves to watch ""Suffering Until Suffrage"" in the America Rock set -- probably because of the music.The bonus materials DVD is OK, but apart from the Emmy section it's mainly fluff. The Scooter Computer and Mister Chips set is the one set of songs that's visibly dated, just by virtue of the subject matter. And I'm not sure why they called ""The Weather Show"" a lost song -- I clearly remember seeing that on Saturday mornings, which means they had to have been playing it pretty regularly. Maybe it was ""lost"" from the Science Rock VHS tape, but then why not just put it in that set on the DVD?Overall, a definite 5-star buy!",5,"25 years later, it's still great.

You, I mean your child (this IS for your kid, right?), can choose to watch all 46 shorts in chronological order; all in random order; watch only the ones themed to grammar, math, money, science or American history and government; or watch only the Top 10 ""Schoolhouse Rock"" classics (such ""Conjuction Junction,"" ""Three is Magic Number"" and ""I'm Just a Bill."")And cherry-picking is just what this set needs, because, frankly, this is a hit-and-miss collection. Some of these shorts are indeed classics (and hold up perfectly well today); others are, frankly, downright lame. But taken in small, hand-selected doses, this 2-disc set can be a great way to introduce, or reinforce, subjects your child is learning in school. Most of the songs are catchy, most of the lessons are simple and clear. An aspiring artist, my daughter also loved the sweet, simple animation, especially in the early shorts. The letters and numbers are drawn by hand. And the solids! Apparently colored in frame-by-frame with a Flair pen, their shading jumps around frame-by-frame -- just like that on early ""Sesame Street"" segments.(Please take my comments with a grain of salt, as I was one of the original ""Schoolhouse Rock"" addicts. Every Saturday morning I had the same routine: plop myself down in front of the TV and watch hour after hour of cartoons. At the end of each show were these cute little shorts -- the same cute little shorts I had seen the week before, and the week before that, and the week before that, drilling lyrics into my young brain such as -- sing them with me -- ""Conjunction Junction, what's your function?"" or ""Lolly, lolly, lolly get your adverbs here!"")Good or bad, you get a lot for your money, more than three-and-a-half-hours of material.

But just reading the list of videos that are on this tape, I see them flash right before my eyes. Therefore, I feel perfectly qualified to review this product for you.  I don't quite know what I would have done without Schoolhouse Rock.  Well, maybe not Grammar Rock, although those were some of my favorites (""Conjunction Junction, what's your function?"").  But I know that when I come up against a problem in my adult life that forces me to multiply an odd combination,  like 13 and 7, I immediately go back to a skater telling me ""Now here's a chance to brush up on your new math tricks, 'cause 8 times 12 is the same as 10 times 8 plus 2 times 8...80 plus 16, 96!""

And how long it can take!  (Now, you have to understand, teachers for babyboomers took special classes on how to make history and civics as boring as possible.

Admittedly, the animation in these pieces tend to be rather simplistic, and a bit of the animation is reused in them, the catchiness of many of these songs more than make up for this.  Besides, the simplistic animation is what gives these segments their distinctiveness uniqueness.The first disc contains all 46 segments that were produced (which include both the segments produced in Schoolhouse Rock's original run, and the newer segments that were produced when Schoolhouse Rock returned to television in 1994).  It also includes the song ""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote to College,"" which was a new song when this set was released in 2002.  This disc also has a play all feature, a shuffle all feature, and a top ten jukebox (the top ten jukebox includes ""Conjunction Junction,"" ""I'm Just A Bill,"" ""Lolly, Lolly, Lolly Get Your Adverbs Here!,"" ""Electricity, Electricity,"" ""Interjections!,"" ""The Preamble,"" ""Three Is A Magic Number,"" ""Interplanet Janet,"" ""A Noun Is A Person, Place Or Thing,"" and ""The Shot Heard 'Round The World"").The second disc contains a lot of bonus material.  There is the long-lost song, ""The Weather Song,"" three of the ""Scooter Computer And Mr. Chips"" segments, a behind-the-scenes of ""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote To College,"" a top twenty countdown, four music videos by contemporary artists, and Emmy Awards featurette, the Nike commercial that features ""Three Is A Magic Number,"" audio commentaries, and another copy of ""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote To College.""  In addition to these features, there is the ""Earn Your Diploma"" trivia game (where the user answers questions pertaining to the topics covered in the Schoolhouse Rock segments) amd arrange-a-song puzzles.  For the puzzles, there is an easy puzzle, and medium puzzle, and a hard puzzle.  For each puzzle, the viewer watches a short clip of a segment.  After it airs, there are screen shots put on the screen.  You select each one to hear the audio that goes with it, and you have to arrange the screen shots in the right order.Overall, I'm very happy with this DVD release, and my kids really enjoy the songs.  My youngest, who can be rather squirmy, has been known to put the first disc in and watch all of the songs on shuffle play and sitting still the whole time.  I would really recommend this DVD release to parents, because kids really seem to get an enjoyment out of these songs and segments.  I would even recommend this set to members of Generation X who don't have children to have in their collection for the sake of nostalgia.I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD that my husband and I purchased.",5,All of the classic Schoolhouse Rock segments in one set,1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,2839,"['member', 'Generation', 'X', 'remembers', 'growing', 'up', 'watching', 'Schoolhouse', 'Rock', 'TV', 'back', 'early', '1980', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'hands', 'set', 'be', 'able', 'share', 'classic', 'segments', 'own', 'children', 'Admittedly', 'animation', 'pieces', 'tend', 'be', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'bit', 'animation', 'reused', 'catchiness', 'many', 'songs', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'Besides', 'simplistic', 'animation', 'what', 'segments', 'distinctiveness', 'first', 'disc', '46', 'segments', 'were', 'produced', 'include', 'segments', 'produced', 'Schoolhouse', 'Rock', 'original', 'run', 'newer', 'segments', 'were', 'produced', 'when', 'Schoolhouse', 'Rock', 'returned', 'television', '1994', 'also', 'song', ""'m"", 'Gon', 'Send', 'Vote', 'College', 'was', 'new', 'song', 'when', 'set', 'was', 'released', '2002', 'disc', 'also', 'play', 'feature', 'shuffle', 'feature', 'top', 'ten', 'jukebox', 'top', 'ten', 'jukebox', 'Conjunction', 'Junction', ""'m"", 'Just', 'A', 'Bill', 'Lolly', 'Lolly', 'Lolly', 'Get', 'Your', 'Adverbs', 'Here', 'Electricity', 'Electricity', 'Interjections', 'Preamble', 'Three', 'Magic', 'Number', 'Interplanet', 'Janet', 'Noun', 'A', 'Person', 'Place', 'Or', 'Thing', 'Shot', 'Heard', 'World', '.The', 'second', 'disc', 'lot', 'bonus', 'material', 'long-lost', 'song', 'Weather', 'Song', 'three', 'Scooter', 'Computer', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'segments', 'behind-the-scenes', ""'m"", 'Gon', 'Send', 'Vote', 'College', 'top', 'twenty', 'countdown', 'four', 'music', 'videos', 'contemporary', 'artists', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'featurette', 'Nike', 'commercial', 'Three', 'Magic', 'Number', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'copy', ""'m"", 'Gon', 'Send', 'Vote', 'College', 'addition', 'features', 'Earn', 'Your', 'Diploma', 'trivia', 'game', 'where', 'user', 'answers', 'questions', 'pertaining', 'topics', 'covered', 'Schoolhouse', 'Rock', 'segments', 'amd', 'arrange-a-song', 'puzzles', 'puzzles', 'easy', 'puzzle', 'medium', 'puzzle', 'hard', 'puzzle', 'puzzle', 'viewer', 'short', 'clip', 'segment', 'are', 'screen', 'shots', 'put', 'screen', 'select', 'one', 'hear', 'audio', 'have', 'arrange', 'screen', 'shots', 'right', 'order.Overall', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'DVD', 'release', 'kids', 'really', 'enjoy', 'songs', 'youngest', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'squirmy', 'been', 'known', 'put', 'first', 'disc', 'watch', 'songs', 'shuffle', 'play', 'sitting', 'still', 'whole', 'time', 'would', 'really', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'release', 'parents', 'kids', 'really', 'seem', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'songs', 'segments', 'would', 'even', 'recommend', 'set', 'members', 'Generation', 'X', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'children', 'have', 'collection', 'sake', 'nostalgia.I', 'wrote', 'review', 'watching', 'copy', 'DVD', 'husband', 'purchased']",N/A

(Am I dating myself?) These are great ways for young kids (and adults) to learn science, math history and grammar in a way that creators Radford Stone, David McCall, George Newall, Bob Dorough and Jack Sheldon never thought would be as lasting or revolution. I made it through social studies and history thanks to the tunes of the `Preamble', ""The Shot Heard Round The World', `Sufferin' Till Suffrage', `I'm Just A Bill' and `The Three Ring Government'.If you don't know what I am talking about these are basic, yet clever, animated shorts that use music to teach you the ins and outs of government, science, multiplication, grammar and even money. They are cleverly written and organized. The DVD has them sectioned off into their various categorized, but you can run them all, play them randomly or play the top ten - whatever you want to do.The Extras are very good. You can watch with the captions and sign-a-long or even program only the ones you want to see. Michael Eisner even introduces the Making Of the newest cartoon - I'm going to `Send Your Vote To College'. There is the original Emmy Award Broadcast where they received their 4 awards (over Sesame Street).  There is also the Scooter and Mr. Chips series of Schoolhouse Rocks. The commentary is great, listening to the creators talk about the production, voices and music they used.There are even modern day music videos of the songs that made them famous.

If you grew up somewhat annoyed by these frequent PSA's that seemed to always get in the way of Dungeons & Dragons and so forth, but found yourself one day years later humming School House Rock on the subway, then this is definitely for you!Quite frankly, this is one of the best designed DVD packages available.  It's a two-disc set with all the making-of stuff and over two hours of memory lane fodder that had me laughing out loud.  There's a ton of material here that stretches well beyond the years I watched SHR, so not all of it will necessarily be as memorable to everyone.  There's a jukebox feature that lets you play all the tracks in random order, or you can watch them by category; grammar rock, math rock, science rock, etc.Some of the material strikes me as remarkably heady for ten-year-olds which is what SHR was initially designed for.  There's a math tune entitled ""Hey Little 12 Toes"" which discusses base-12 math.  The government lessons revel in obvious political biases which are really quite charming and clever, regardless of your politics.The only criticism I have is that there weren't recurring characters, which in my opinion worked against the potential for greater popularity among kids that were ""forced"" to view this stuff while waiting for cartoons.  This is so minor that it's barely worth noting however.Eventually the networks abandoned the Saturday morning institution that stretched back to the 50's in favor of extended lite-news coverage.  Any extant cartoon production was outsourced to things like Nickelodeon [Nick Jr.] or left for the cable networks such as the Cartoon Network to gobble up...and thus began my disdain for corporate America [haha].In general, the School House Rock Anniversary DVD is absolutely wonderful from start to finish and is a superlative reminder of that forgotten shared experience we all knew as Saturday morning cartoons.5/5",5,Perpetual Saturday morning!,1043107200,"01 21, 2003",2003,1963,"['must-have', 'Gen-X-er', 'worth', 'his/her', 'salt', '[', 'grin', ']', 'grew', 'up', 'somewhat', 'annoyed', 'frequent', 'PSA', 'seemed', 'always', 'get', 'way', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'so', 'forth', 'found', 'one', 'day', 'years', 'later', 'humming', 'School', 'House', 'Rock', 'subway', 'then', 'definitely', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'one', 'best', 'designed', 'DVD', 'packages', 'available', 'two-disc', 'set', 'making-of', 'stuff', 'two', 'hours', 'memory', 'lane', 'fodder', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'ton', 'material', 'here', 'stretches', 'well', 'years', 'watched', 'SHR', 'not', 'will', 'necessarily', 'be', 'memorable', 'everyone', 'jukebox', 'feature', 'play', 'tracks', 'random', 'order', 'can', 'watch', 'category', 'grammar', 'rock', 'math', 'rock', 'science', 'rock', 'etc.Some', 'material', 'remarkably', 'heady', 'ten-year-olds', 'what', 'SHR', 'was', 'initially', 'designed', 'math', 'tune', 'entitled', 'Hey', 'Little', '12', 'Toes', 'base-12', 'math', 'government', 'lessons', 'revel', 'obvious', 'political', 'biases', 'are', 'really', 'quite', 'charming', 'clever', 'regardless', 'politics.The', 'only', 'criticism', 'have', 'were', ""n't"", 'recurring', 'characters', 'opinion', 'worked', 'potential', 'greater', 'popularity', 'kids', 'were', 'forced', 'view', 'stuff', 'waiting', 'cartoons', 'so', 'minor', 'barely', 'worth', 'noting', 'however.Eventually', 'networks', 'abandoned', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'institution', 'stretched', 'back', '50', 'favor', 'extended', 'lite-news', 'coverage', 'extant', 'cartoon', 'production', 'was', 'outsourced', 'things', 'Nickelodeon', '[', 'Nick', 'Jr.', ']', 'left', 'cable', 'networks', 'such', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'gobble', 'up', 'thus', 'began', 'disdain', 'corporate', 'America', '[', 'haha', ']', '.In', 'general', 'School', 'House', 'Rock', 'Anniversary', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'start', 'finish', 'superlative', 'reminder', 'forgotten', 'shared', 'experience', 'knew', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons.5/5']",N/A

I purchased this tape for my young nieces and nephews convinced that ""School House Rock"" would prove to be a fun and easy way for them to learn about key U.S. historical events, elements of grammar and basic mathematics.  The arrival of the tape triggered a flood of memories. The words to my favorite episodes, ""Conjunction Junction"", ""Verb"" and ""Bill"" begin to spill forth as if I were eight years old sitting in front of the television captivated by the music and colorful characters that make up each episode.  Well, I had to open the box and play the tape, just to make sure there were no manufacturers defects (O.K., so that's what I told myself as I excitedly opened the package that is to be a Christmas gift for the little ones).  After getting through a series of Disney advertisements, I was greeted with images and songs that were a critical component of my childhood.  I soon found myself singing along and acting out parts.  I was surprised at how much I'd remembered (had learned) and how entertaining the episodes are.  All of a sudden, I'm making long distance calls to friends reminiscing, singing, laughing, and being young again.This is a perfect gift for kids.

While I can no longer see what it is I saw in the cartoons (though I still think they are better than what is on today) I can clearly see why I loved Schoolhouse Rock (and still do)!  I forgot all these tunes/cartoons when by the mid to late 1980's I was in college.  One night over the dinner table my usual group of about 10 people stated ""Hey, whatever happened to Schoolhouse Rock?  I loved those songs?""  We then all began singing our favorites and wishing they could still be seen. These songs allowed us all to know the difference between a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, to know about the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Louisiana Purchase, the Revolutionary War, math, and even a little science.  They are catchy, memorable, make learning fun, and best of all in today's ever popular ""don't-put-anything-on-children's-television-unless-it-also-has-a-toy-to-sell"" world, simply good for goodness' sake.  I have seen other reviewers criticize this for not being 100% correct, well perhaps, but more importantly, Schoolhouse Rock may inspire children to want to learn more about the subject matter - a key step!  The day my husband and I first discovered they were available in VHS/DVD was a great day.

I remember my years in elementary school (2nd-6th grade, especially), watching Saturday morning cartoons and then seeing a Schoolhouse Rock toon. Anyone who has kids (which I don't) or grew up in the 70s (which I did) needs to have this 2-DVD set because it is wonderful! I love every single thing about this 2-DVD set. I love the fact that it's got all 46 oringinal animated Schoolhouse Rock toons plus the new Schoolhouse Rock toon called ""I'm gonna send your vote to college"", plus you can play the toons in their seperate categories (grammar rock, america rock, multiplication rock, science rock & money rock) or all of the toons together, either in order or in shuffle play. I also like the top 10 jukebox feature. The bonus features on disc 2 are really amazing, such as the long-lost Schoolhouse Rock toon ""The Weather Show"", the 3 out of 4 Schoolhouse Rock toon set called ""Scooter Computer & Mr. Chips"", the top 20 countdown of Schoolhouse Rock toons, the 4 music videos by certain music groups and the Nike commercial set to the tune of ""Three is a magic number"". The audio commentaries are interesting, but what's really neat are the surround-sound version of ""I'm gonna send your vote to college"" the behind-the-scenes featurette about the making of ""I'm gonna send your vote to college"", the featurette about the Schoolhouse Rock creators winning 4 Emmy Awards and the 2 interactive games: the arrange-a-song puzzles game & the ""Earn Your Diploma"" trivia game.

I was so pumped (now that I have a DVD player) to hear that they were releasing a big-time anniversary edition of Schoolhouse Rock in its entirety. I've had four of the videos for years, but this set is so much better. Disc One has all of the original songs--you can play them in order, randomly, just the top ten--and an all-new song about the Electoral College (inspired, no doubt, by the 2000 presidential election). The way you can navigate your way through any and/or all of the songs is very easy and great for when you don't just want to hear about grammar (or history, math, etc. . .).What really puts this over the top, though, is Disc Two, with a bucket load of extras: the lost ""Weather Show,"" a new computer three-song set, a making-of feaure, top 20 countdowns, an interactive trivia game, music videos by contemporary artists, audio commentaries, Emmy Award footage, etc. . . . I can't wait to explore even more than I got to last night! This will be such a great tool for my 21-month-old daughter (who will know how a bill becomes a law and how to use a conjunction in a sentence!) and a ton of fun for me in the process.The video quality isn't MONSTERS, INC., but it doesn't have to be. The old animation holds up just fine, as does the audio, which audiophiles could probably complain about if they want to poop the party for the rest of us. What really stands up to the test of time, aside from the basic content, is the music. These guys (primarily) did some really good arranging, little of it in the rock 'n roll genre, ironically. Jack Sheldon delivers some spectacular jazz vocals on several of the more famous tunes. Complicated yet catchy melodies are the strength--that's why we all remember ""I'm Just a Bill"" and ""Conjunction Junction""--with great backing vocals and instrumentation to boot. The contemporary artists' renditions didn't hold up to the originals, but they were pretty interesting to hear. The interactive stuff will be great for kids hearing these songs for the first time. The interviews and commentaries are really interesting, especially in hindsight. Great new additions, discoveries, and formats all add to the charm of the original forty-six songs. How they managed to get all of that factual information into essentially a music video, while keeping the kids (and me) entertained, is still a mystery to me.Bottom Line: You'll be hard-pressed to find a better combination of education and entertainment. If there are any factual inaccuracies, they are minor enough to overlook and could actually spark interesting conversations. The basic content is right on-the-money. The fact that they'll actually be talking about and be interested in the grammar, history, science, and economics is important enough to overlook any minor flaws.The fact that my daughter, who two years (and a couple of months) old, actually knows that ""Wow!"" is an interjection, a fact that most of my juniors (I'm a teacher) wouldn't know off the top of their heads, speaks volumes. . . !",5,This Is So Cool--Facts can be Fun!!,1034208000,"10 10, 2002",2002,3035,"['even', 'educational', 'was', 'so', 'pumped', 'now', 'have', 'DVD', 'player', 'hear', 'were', 'releasing', 'big-time', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'Schoolhouse', 'Rock', 'entirety', ""'ve"", 'had', 'four', 'videos', 'years', 'set', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Disc', 'One', 'original', 'songs', 'can', 'play', 'order', 'randomly', 'just', 'top', 'ten', 'all-new', 'song', 'Electoral', 'College', 'inspired', 'doubt', '2000', 'presidential', 'election', 'way', 'can', 'navigate', 'way', 'and/or', 'songs', 'very', 'easy', 'great', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'want', 'hear', 'grammar', 'history', 'math', 'etc', 'really', 'top', 'though', 'Disc', 'Two', 'bucket', 'load', 'extras', 'lost', 'Weather', 'Show', 'new', 'computer', 'three-song', 'set', 'making-of', 'feaure', 'top', '20', 'countdowns', 'interactive', 'trivia', 'game', 'music', 'videos', 'contemporary', 'artists', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'footage', 'etc', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'explore', 'even', 'more', 'got', 'last', 'night', 'will', 'be', 'such', 'great', 'tool', '21-month-old', 'daughter', 'who', 'will', 'know', 'how', 'bill', 'law', 'how', 'use', 'conjunction', 'sentence', 'ton', 'fun', 'process.The', 'video', 'quality', ""n't"", 'MONSTERS', 'INC.', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'old', 'animation', 'up', 'just', 'fine', 'audio', 'could', 'probably', 'complain', 'want', 'poop', 'party', 'rest', 'What', 'really', 'up', 'test', 'time', 'aside', 'basic', 'content', 'music', 'guys', 'primarily', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'arranging', 'little', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'genre', 'ironically', 'Jack', 'Sheldon', 'spectacular', 'jazz', 'vocals', 'several', 'more', 'famous', 'tunes', 'Complicated', 'yet', 'catchy', 'melodies', 'are', 'strength', 'why', 'remember', ""'m"", 'Just', 'Bill', 'Conjunction', 'Junction', 'great', 'backing', 'vocals', 'instrumentation', 'boot', 'contemporary', 'artists', 'renditions', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'originals', 'were', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'hear', 'interactive', 'stuff', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'kids', 'hearing', 'songs', 'first', 'time', 'interviews', 'commentaries', 'are', 'really', 'interesting', 'especially', 'hindsight', 'Great', 'new', 'additions', 'discoveries', 'add', 'charm', 'original', 'forty-six', 'songs', 'How', 'managed', 'get', 'factual', 'information', 'essentially', 'music', 'video', 'keeping', 'kids', 'entertained', 'still', 'mystery', 'me.Bottom', 'Line', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'better', 'combination', 'education', 'entertainment', 'are', 'factual', 'inaccuracies', 'are', 'minor', 'enough', 'overlook', 'could', 'actually', 'spark', 'interesting', 'conversations', 'basic', 'content', 'right', 'on-the-money', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'be', 'talking', 'be', 'interested', 'grammar', 'history', 'science', 'economics', 'important', 'enough', 'overlook', 'minor', 'flaws.The', 'fact', 'daughter', 'who', 'two', 'years', 'couple', 'months', 'old', 'actually', 'Wow', 'interjection', 'fact', 'most', 'juniors', ""'m"", 'teacher', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'off', 'top', 'heads', 'speaks', 'volumes']",N/A

Let's put it this way...This is one of my kids' most requested DVDs (ages three through seven), and they walk around the house singing about nouns, the branches of the government, counting by 5s, electricity and the National 'Tyrannosaurus' Debt.The songs in this compilation of shorts that used to run between regularly scheduled shows on Saturday mornings on ABC mainly during the 70s actually helped me in school. Schoolhouse Rock! is a series of 46 educational shorts featuring easy to sing along to songs about grammar, science, math, economics, history, and politics. Money was added in the 90s and computers to the 2002 DVD release.My preschooler--because of this DVD--can count to 100 by 5s and my second grader knows what a noun is and that all he needs to do to describe nouns is ""unpack his adjectives"".Each song is apx 3 minutes or less of straightforward education. And since the songs are so brief and the lyrics are so easy to remember, kids retain a lot of information from some very short, simple lessons.This is an essential purchase if you have young children.Side note: The ads at the beginning of the DVD are indeed a pain, but easily circumvented by pressing the STOP button TWICE on your remote as soon as the first ad starts, then pressing your MENU button instead of PLAY to get the DVD going again; this brings you right to the main menu where you can play the DVD by topic, mix up the songs or play them in order.",5,Interjection...HEY!

I grew up watching it just like everybody else my age.Looking back on it now, sure, the nostalgia factor is high.  But sometimes, the various segments can be factually inaccurate.For example, the ""Verb"" song identifies ""batting"" as a verb, when it's actually a gerund that acts as a noun in a sentence. Example: ""I like batting."" The subject is ""I"". The verb is ""like"". And the object -- which has to be a noun -- is the gerund ""batting"". Now, maybe gerunds are a little beyond the scope of the song, but then it should have stuck to plain old verbs like ""bat"" (I bat, you bat, etc.), not ""batting"".Another problem is that ""Interplanet Janet"" strongly implies that the sun is a planet, when it is actually a star. (The lyrics briefly -- very briefly -- mention that it's a star, but the overwhelming repetition of the word ""planet"" in the song, as well as the inclusion of the Sun along with all the other planets in order, implies that the sun's a planet too, just like all the others.)There are other slip-ups like this throughout the series, if you look for them.

Langan ""take403""","[7, 8]","I can't say this myself about the DVD collection (famous last words of the ""Interjections"" jingle), since there are still a lot of videos I still need to sit down and watch.  I think all of us who grew up in the 1970's and 1980's learned from the catchy jingles.If it weren't for the countrified ""The Preamble,"" I wouldn't have it recited nor known what a veto is had it not been for ""I'm Just a Bill"" (both from America Rock).""Electricity, Electricity"" is really a rewrite of ""Conjunction Junction"" but no less informative or entertaining (from the Science Rock series).  The ""Victim of Gravity"" song stands out with its 1950's doo-whop influence (the character in the video even has James Dean sideburns!).If it weren't for ""Conjunction Junction"", ""Lolly Lolly Lolly,"" or the funky ""Verb That's What's Happening,"" I probably wouldn't have been as successful with grammar (all from the Grammar Rock series).But most of all, I think I learned my multiplication tables thanks to Multiplication Rock.  The songs ""Three Is a Magic Number,"" ""Lucky Seven Samson"" (ya gotta love that long eared blackeyed bandit!) and ""Ready or Not, Here I Come"" were favorites(I used to count this way whenever I got tricked into playing another dreaded game of Hide and Seek!).The folky ""No More Kings"" almost sounds a little anti-British now, I suppose (and the animators goofed since the British flag did not include the red cross of Northern Ireland at the time; aside from that, still a very educational and catchy song/video!).Money Rock and Computer Rock introduced some new learning songs to an even younger generation (Mr Chips is introduced as a returning character and there's an interesting song about saving your money, which gives a nod to Reba, Wynnona and Dolly Parton).There are commentaries on ""A Noun Is a Person, Place or Thing"" (I like the mention of the Beatles, the Monkees and Chubby Checker!), ""The Great American Melting Pot"" and ""Figure Eight,"" to name a few.  In addition, ""The Weather Show"" (which was previously banned from syndication and VHS anthologies due to legal entanglements) and a ""new"" song ""I'm Gonna Send Your Vote to College"" are included in this 48 song anthology.  There are interviews with the producers, animators and some of the musicians and performers.While I was away at college, I read in our school newspaper there were picketers to bring Schoolhouse Rock back on the air (it worked!).  I remember as a 29 year old watching intently ""Energy"" and my older brother said tongue firmly in cheek ""You're the biggest kid I know!""  If you have kids or are a teacher (or just a nostalgic buff or a kid at heart yourself), you'll want this generously packaged collection- indoubtedly (to quote Mr. Lolly)!",5,"""Darn!
