899955,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000929VS6,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[5, 6]","Believe it or not, Gore Verbinski's ""The Ring"" wasn't the first remake of the hit horror movie. A few years before that, a Korean remake of the original Japanese film was undertaken, but ""Ring Virus"" lacks a cohesive script, dramatic tension or semi-realistic characters.Journalist Hong Sun-Ju (Eun-Kyung Shin) learns her young niece and her pals have died mysteriously -- the official report is that they all had heart attacks, but Sun-Ju notices that the girl was tearing out her hair. The one similarity is a videotape full of odd images, which Sun-Ju watches. At the end is a warning that she will die in seven days, if she doesn't follow the following instructions. Too bad some idiot taped over those instructions.After what has happened to her niece, Sun-Ju is freaked out. She seeks the help of the quirky coroner Dr. Chin (Jin-yeong Jeong), who supports the curse theory of the videotape. The two of them explore the sinister past of a Korean island, a famous psychic, and the mysterious young girl Eun-suh (Du-na Bae) who is the key to the curse.Yeah, it sounds pretty similar to both ""Ringu"" and ""The Ring,"" and it does have the same basic plot. There are a few differences, like Sun-Ju having a daughter, but in essence it's the same plot. Except, of course, that the movie surrounding that plot is a stinker.The thing that kills ""Ring Virus"" is director Dong-bin Kim. His direction is choppy and often lifts scenes from the far superior Hideo Nakata -- which basically means that comparisons are inevitable. He doesn't know how to make the movie creepy and tense, or to take advantage of the suspenseful moments, like the face hidden in Eun-suh's hair.Eun-Kyung Shin does a passable job, but she seems too passive; Jin-yeong Jeong has a fun character, and he plays up the quirkiness well, but he sticks out like a sore thumb. Especially since his entire reason for being in the film (besides being a love interest) is to make wild leaps in logic, and telling the audience information that he can't possibly have figured out on his own.The most disastrous character is Eun-suh, the ghoulgirl who made the curse in the first place. The entire plot essentially revolves around her scheming, evil personality. Turning her into a mopey teenager -- complete with flashbacks -- rather than someone who has become utterly evil essentially destroys the whole idea of the cursed videotape.""Ring Virus"" has one or two interesting things going for it, but the stumbling direction and terrible Eun-suh are enough to sink it. This is one virus that should be medicated away.",2,"Sickly ""Virus""",1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,2573,"['Believe', 'not', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'Ring', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'remake', 'hit', 'horror', 'movie', 'few', 'years', 'Korean', 'remake', 'original', 'Japanese', 'film', 'was', 'undertaken', 'Ring', 'Virus', 'cohesive', 'script', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'semi-realistic', 'characters.Journalist', 'Hong', 'Sun-Ju', 'Eun-Kyung', 'Shin', 'young', 'niece', 'pals', 'have', 'died', 'mysteriously', 'official', 'report', 'had', 'heart', 'attacks', 'Sun-Ju', 'notices', 'girl', 'was', 'tearing', 'out', 'hair', 'one', 'similarity', 'videotape', 'full', 'odd', 'images', 'Sun-Ju', 'watches', 'end', 'warning', 'will', 'die', 'seven', 'days', ""n't"", 'follow', 'following', 'instructions', 'Too', 'bad', 'idiot', 'taped', 'instructions.After', 'happened', 'niece', 'Sun-Ju', 'freaked', 'out', 'help', 'quirky', 'coroner', 'Dr.', 'Chin', 'Jin-yeong', 'Jeong', 'who', 'curse', 'theory', 'videotape', 'two', 'explore', 'sinister', 'past', 'Korean', 'island', 'famous', 'psychic', 'mysterious', 'young', 'girl', 'Eun-suh', 'Du-na', 'Bae', 'who', 'key', 'curse.Yeah', 'pretty', 'similar', 'Ringu', 'Ring', 'have', 'same', 'basic', 'plot', 'are', 'few', 'differences', 'Sun-Ju', 'having', 'daughter', 'essence', 'same', 'plot', 'course', 'movie', 'surrounding', 'plot', 'stinker.The', 'thing', 'Ring', 'Virus', 'director', 'Dong-bin', 'Kim', 'direction', 'choppy', 'often', 'lifts', 'scenes', 'far', 'superior', 'Hideo', 'Nakata', 'basically', 'comparisons', 'are', 'inevitable', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'make', 'movie', 'creepy', 'tense', 'take', 'advantage', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'face', 'hidden', 'Eun-suh', 'hair.Eun-Kyung', 'Shin', 'passable', 'job', 'too', 'passive', 'Jin-yeong', 'Jeong', 'fun', 'character', 'up', 'quirkiness', 'well', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'Especially', 'entire', 'reason', 'being', 'film', 'being', 'love', 'interest', 'make', 'wild', 'leaps', 'logic', 'telling', 'audience', 'information', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'own.The', 'most', 'disastrous', 'character', 'Eun-suh', 'ghoulgirl', 'who', 'made', 'curse', 'first', 'place', 'entire', 'plot', 'essentially', 'scheming', 'evil', 'personality', 'Turning', 'mopey', 'teenager', 'complete', 'flashbacks', 'rather', 'someone', 'who', 'become', 'utterly', 'evil', 'essentially', 'whole', 'idea', 'cursed', 'videotape', 'Ring', 'Virus', 'one', 'two', 'interesting', 'things', 'going', 'stumbling', 'direction', 'terrible', 'Eun-suh', 'are', 'enough', 'sink', 'one', 'virus', 'should', 'be', 'medicated', 'away']",N/A

If you're looking at this you've likely already seen both the American and Japanese versions of this film.  This Korean version is far less well known than either of those, and not with out good reason.  It isn't bad, certainly, and it's interesting to watch in context of the novel and the other films, but it's really nothing special.  I think it's something of a curiosity, and definitely worth a watch for me, but it's not anything to stunning.I won't bother rehashing the plot details as you doubtless already know the basics, though I will mention that this version is indeed more faithful to the novel than either of the other versions.  Trouble is, I think the reworking of the central mythology and the style of the tape in the two films are more interesting and less... weird than they were in the novel.  Also, the Ryuji stand in here (I forget his Korean name) is much more like the Ryuji of the book: a snide, snarky weirdo.  He does perhaps add a bit of personality to the film, but he's also kind of irritating.  Make no mistake, there are still quite a few differences between this film and the original novel, but it's definitely closer than either of the other films.  (To the best of my recollection, anyway.)This version also particularly resembles the novel in that it is almost entirely lacking in horror elements in the middle, investigatory section.  It still manages to create a somewhat foreboding atmosphere, but not nearly to the same degree as the Japanese version, nor does it have anything comparable to the frightening set pieces found in the American version.  I wouldn't say it ever gets boring, but it's not that lively either.  This less supernatural approach worked pretty well in the book, but it's not as effective in a film, as you aren't allowed to hear nearly as many details, and film just generally demands a higher action quotient.As a whole the film is competently made, though, as with most other aspects of the movie, it's nothing to get worked up over.  The acting is solid, though the characters don't prove to be terribly memorable or likable (a concern in all versions.) The sound and music are reasonably effective, though I must say, once again, not as good as in the other films.  There is some fairly cool and occasionally energetic camerawork, though it is hampered somewhat by the very poor visual quality of this DVD.I guess that's it.  Again, fairly interesting for those who like the other films and novel, but far from great.Grade: C+",3,"Somewhat interesting for fans of the other films, but not really very good",1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,2546,"['Not', 'too', 'much', 'say', 'here', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'short', ""'re"", 'looking', ""'ve"", 'likely', 'already', 'seen', 'American', 'Japanese', 'versions', 'film', 'Korean', 'version', 'far', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'not', 'out', 'good', 'reason', ""n't"", 'bad', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'watch', 'context', 'novel', 'other', 'films', 'really', 'nothing', 'special', 'think', 'something', 'curiosity', 'definitely', 'watch', 'not', 'anything', 'stunning.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'rehashing', 'plot', 'details', 'doubtless', 'already', 'know', 'basics', 'will', 'mention', 'version', 'indeed', 'more', 'faithful', 'novel', 'other', 'versions', 'Trouble', 'think', 'reworking', 'central', 'mythology', 'style', 'tape', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'less', 'weird', 'were', 'novel', 'Also', 'Ryuji', 'stand', 'here', 'forget', 'Korean', 'name', 'much', 'more', 'Ryuji', 'book', 'snide', 'snarky', 'weirdo', 'perhaps', 'add', 'bit', 'personality', 'film', 'also', 'kind', 'irritating', 'Make', 'mistake', 'are', 'still', 'quite', 'few', 'differences', 'film', 'original', 'novel', 'definitely', 'closer', 'other', 'films', 'best', 'recollection', 'anyway', 'version', 'also', 'particularly', 'novel', 'almost', 'entirely', 'lacking', 'horror', 'elements', 'middle', 'investigatory', 'section', 'still', 'create', 'somewhat', 'foreboding', 'atmosphere', 'not', 'nearly', 'same', 'degree', 'Japanese', 'version', 'have', 'anything', 'comparable', 'frightening', 'set', 'pieces', 'found', 'American', 'version', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'ever', 'boring', 'not', 'lively', 'less', 'supernatural', 'approach', 'worked', 'pretty', 'well', 'book', 'not', 'effective', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'hear', 'nearly', 'as', 'many', 'details', 'film', 'just', 'generally', 'higher', 'action', 'whole', 'film', 'competently', 'made', 'though', 'most', 'other', 'aspects', 'movie', 'nothing', 'get', 'worked', 'up', 'acting', 'solid', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'prove', 'be', 'terribly', 'memorable', 'likable', 'concern', 'versions', 'sound', 'music', 'are', 'reasonably', 'effective', 'must', 'say', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'films', 'fairly', 'cool', 'occasionally', 'energetic', 'camerawork', 'hampered', 'somewhat', 'very', 'poor', 'visual', 'quality', 'DVD.I', 'guess', 'Again', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'who', 'like', 'other', 'films', 'novel', 'far', 'great.Grade', 'C+']",N/A

899959,A1ZEC2CUWJD8OM,B000929VS6,S. Foster,"[6, 7]","Although a great fan of Japanese culture, I bought this DVD (& the sequel, which is even better) based on reviews in UK movie magazines.  A mammoth horror hit in indie cinema outside of its homeland, Ring tells the tale of an urban myth - of a video in circulation that contains cryptic & harrowing imagery.  Immediately after watching the video, the phone rings (hence the title) announcing death to the watcher within 1 week.  This, the first movie of the trilogy, introduces the viewer to Sadako, the famed body who crawls out of the well & through the viewer's TV to kill them, leaving the corpse inexplicably frozen with fear.  We join a journalist & her ex-husband go on a trail to discover the origins behind the horror of the video after the journalist watches it herself & receives the call.  This is not a movie that depends on blood, guts & intense music to create drama - it happens itself as we pursue the myth of Sadako & some gruesome deaths along the way.  The first time you see Sadako, your hairs will rise on your neck!!!  Great, great movie, the sooner it gets a US DVD release, the better.  Love the movie & it reminds the viewer that great cinema does not necessarily come from Hollywood big budgets, or more importantly, English speaking nations.",5,Startling Horror Alternative,1019606400,"04 24, 2002",2002,1269,"['great', 'fan', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'bought', 'DVD', 'sequel', 'even', 'better', 'based', 'reviews', 'UK', 'movie', 'magazines', 'mammoth', 'horror', 'hit', 'indie', 'cinema', 'homeland', 'Ring', 'tells', 'tale', 'urban', 'myth', 'video', 'circulation', 'cryptic', 'harrowing', 'imagery', 'Immediately', 'watching', 'video', 'phone', 'rings', 'hence', 'title', 'announcing', 'death', 'watcher', '1', 'week', 'first', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'viewer', 'Sadako', 'famed', 'body', 'who', 'well', 'viewer', 'TV', 'kill', 'leaving', 'corpse', 'inexplicably', 'frozen', 'fear', 'join', 'journalist', 'ex-husband', 'go', 'trail', 'discover', 'origins', 'horror', 'video', 'journalist', 'call', 'not', 'movie', 'blood', 'guts', 'intense', 'music', 'create', 'drama', 'pursue', 'myth', 'Sadako', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'way', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'Sadako', 'hairs', 'will', 'rise', 'neck', 'Great', 'great', 'movie', 'sooner', 'US', 'DVD', 'release', 'better', 'Love', 'movie', 'viewer', 'great', 'cinema', 'not', 'necessarily', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'big', 'budgets', 'more', 'importantly', 'English', 'speaking', 'nations']",N/A
