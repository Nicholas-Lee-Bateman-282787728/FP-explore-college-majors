1336541,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B003CNQPME,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[2, 2]","Rhoda hit its stride with this season.  The weakest character, the husband Joe, was sidelined in a separation. In those episodes where he did appear, he was used to good effect as someone you would ultimately want to divorce.  Rhoda is a character with a lot of facets and depth whereas Joe seems to exist on one plane only.  If he weren't good looking, he wouldn't have anyone who wanted to spend time with him other than tv football watching fans or fellow heavy construction workers.Replacing Joe was the incomparable Ron Silver as Gary Levey who went on to star in movies and tv for the rest of his life.  He is Rhoda's and Brenda's friend, not their boyfriend.  He is just wonderful every moment he is on camera.Then came comic Ann Meara as stewardess Sally, at counterpoint with her comic husband Jerry Stiller, who plays her ex.  They are also terrific.However, the best additions were two lounge lizards, Nick Lobo and Johnny Venture.  Nick dates Brenda and Johnny is trying to date Rhoda. Johnny is a hugely successful Las Vegas entertainer.  He wears tons of jewelry, velvet suits with ruffled shirts, pompadour styled hair and sings like a Frank Sinatra wannabe.  He scores with every woman he meets except for Rhoda so Rhoda becomes his primary quest. These two are fabulous together and Rhoda's wisecracks have never been better than they are with Johnny Venture.The only thing missing is Ida.  Ida, played by Nancy Walker, tried her own show this season.  It didn't work out so she came back.  But you only see her on the first episode here. However, after two seasons of watching her do her Jewish mother bit with Brenda and Rhoda (which she also did on ""Mary Tyler Moore""), I was ready for something else anyway.",5,Much Better than seasons one and two,1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,1728,"['Rhoda', 'hit', 'stride', 'season', 'weakest', 'character', 'husband', 'Joe', 'was', 'sidelined', 'separation', 'episodes', 'where', 'did', 'appear', 'was', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'someone', 'would', 'ultimately', 'want', 'divorce', 'Rhoda', 'character', 'lot', 'facets', 'depth', 'whereas', 'Joe', 'exist', 'one', 'plane', 'only', 'were', ""n't"", 'good', 'looking', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'anyone', 'who', 'wanted', 'spend', 'time', 'other', 'tv', 'football', 'watching', 'fans', 'fellow', 'heavy', 'construction', 'workers.Replacing', 'Joe', 'was', 'incomparable', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Gary', 'Levey', 'who', 'went', 'star', 'movies', 'tv', 'rest', 'life', 'Rhoda', 'Brenda', 'friend', 'not', 'boyfriend', 'just', 'wonderful', 'moment', 'camera.Then', 'came', 'comic', 'Ann', 'Meara', 'stewardess', 'Sally', 'counterpoint', 'comic', 'husband', 'Jerry', 'Stiller', 'who', 'ex', 'are', 'also', 'terrific.However', 'best', 'additions', 'were', 'two', 'lounge', 'lizards', 'Nick', 'Lobo', 'Johnny', 'Venture', 'Nick', 'Brenda', 'Johnny', 'trying', 'date', 'Rhoda', 'Johnny', 'hugely', 'successful', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'entertainer', 'tons', 'jewelry', 'velvet', 'suits', 'ruffled', 'shirts', 'pompadour', 'styled', 'hair', 'sings', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'wannabe', 'woman', 'Rhoda', 'so', 'Rhoda', 'primary', 'quest', 'two', 'are', 'fabulous', 'together', 'Rhoda', 'wisecracks', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'are', 'Johnny', 'Venture.The', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'Ida', 'Ida', 'played', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'tried', 'own', 'show', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'so', 'came', 'back', 'only', 'see', 'first', 'episode', 'here', 'However', 'two', 'seasons', 'watching', 'do', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'bit', 'Brenda', 'Rhoda', 'also', 'did', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'was', 'ready', 'something', 'else', 'anyway']",N/A

Joe unplugs the marriage with a separation but we still have Mom and the spacious apartment so it's not too bad and the episodes are well written and Valerie's acting is great but once in awhile there is some awkwardly written dialogue, that doesn't gel. Okay it's not too bad so far...Then suddenly Rhoda's Mom and Dad are gone, her very funny co-worker and her office disappear, Joe slowly exits, his workplace as well with all the characters that populated his world and Rhoda's frequently pregnant friend who was very charming also exits the series only to show up for one episode. These are replaced with the introduction of Sally an annoying woman and it kind of becomes the Rhoda and Sally show for awhile. But the successful introduction of a character named Gary who comes into the series at the beginning of season 3 with some very weird mannerisms and stereotyping of men he gets to become very interesting and charming as the series progresses, though the stereotyping continues with other men it is saved with other great male characters; Johnny Venture and Benny Goodwin who are funny and well played by the actors. Also Nick Lobo becomes a semi-regular with some great episodes! Meanwhile Rhoda has quickly moved into another apartment that's smaller and more claustrophobic  There are some good episodes but these big changes don't come gradually, they just happen and we are expected to accept them; well the writing isn't always strong enough to support them.

It's hard watching this season as Valerie Harper as Rhoda endures {sadly} the end of their relationship.  The writers had said it was hard to write episodes with David Groh as Joe.  In all fairness, Groh does play his character rather blandly.  Still, the marriage was solid, and inspiring to us viewers.  The scripts may have been better without Groh as Joe, but it was just too sad.
