Adults, on the other hand, might find the plot to be a bit boring and far-fetched.  Even though Jay North (Dennis the Menace) does an admirable acting job, there is no way a boy his age would let out all the animals in the zoo without thinking of the potentially dire consequences -- not only to the public but to the animals themselves.  Still, it was slightly ahead of its time in increasing public awareness on some of the less-than-desirable conditions of some animals in captivity.

Plenty of weirdness and monkeyshine to laugh at and you won't have to cover anybody's eyes or send the kids out of the room for cupcakes during any particular scene.  The humor is mostly slapstick sight gags and the soundtrack music is catchy. No references to sex, drugs or excessive violence.  Some crooked politicians are part of the plot, but that's non biased as its left up to the viewer to decide whether they're Republicans, Democrats or any of the sort that barely gets any votes come election day.The DVD includes the original trailer that aired on television, but watch that after the movie because it contains a few plot spoilers.",5,"Some good, clean fun with a mess of monkeys",1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,761,"['Here', 'what', ""'d"", 'been', 'looking', 'easy', 'going', 'family', 'oriented', 'comedy', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'show', 'nephew', 'Plenty', 'weirdness', 'monkeyshine', 'laugh', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'cover', 'anybody', 'eyes', 'send', 'kids', 'room', 'cupcakes', 'particular', 'scene', 'humor', 'mostly', 'slapstick', 'sight', 'gags', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'catchy', 'references', 'sex', 'drugs', 'excessive', 'violence', 'crooked', 'politicians', 'are', 'part', 'plot', 'non', 'biased', 'left', 'up', 'viewer', 'decide', ""'re"", 'Republicans', 'Democrats', 'sort', 'barely', 'votes', 'come', 'election', 'day.The', 'DVD', 'original', 'trailer', 'aired', 'television', 'watch', 'movie', 'few', 'plot', 'spoilers']",N/A

What does matter is giving enough information so I can understand better why the movie was liked or not liked. In other words, less generalities (the acting was good, the plot was boring) and more specifics (WHY was the acting good, or WHY was the plot boring). It has been sometime since I last saw this movie, though I do have it on one of my multitude of VHS tapes. I enjoy animal movies, and wanted to see Jay North in action years after he was Dennis the Menace. I also like Martin Milner whom I'd seen in Adam-12 and Valley of the Dolls. I can always understand what he is saying, and appreciate how he conveys emotions in his delivery. While I did think Sunshine a dumb name for a cougar, I could understand how the boy didn't want to leave him behind when his family had to move. When the animal's behavior led to his being placed in a zoo, I could also understand how the boy felt about seeing his beloved pet behind bars, being deprived of a wild and free life. Okay, setting the animals loose was a very foolhardy act, but if it caused people to think about current conditions at the zoo and how some funding could really turn things around, that was good. If you compare the zoo as it was to what it became, because of the townspeople's eyes becoming open to how the wild animals ought to be housed, it has to make you feel good, and that is one of the best kinds of movies, in my opinion.",3,"Not One of My Favorites, But Lots of Animals",1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,1555,"['review', 'just', 'wanted', 'explain', 'when', 'decide', 'review', 'helpful', 'not', ""n't"", 'matter', 'viewer', 'liked', 'movie', 'not', 'What', 'matter', 'giving', 'enough', 'information', 'can', 'understand', 'better', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'liked', 'not', 'liked', 'other', 'words', 'less', 'generalities', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'plot', 'was', 'boring', 'more', 'specifics', 'WHY', 'was', 'acting', 'good', 'WHY', 'was', 'plot', 'boring', 'been', 'sometime', 'last', 'saw', 'movie', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'multitude', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'enjoy', 'animal', 'movies', 'wanted', 'see', 'Jay', 'North', 'action', 'years', 'was', 'Dennis', 'Menace', 'also', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'whom', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Adam-12', 'Valley', 'Dolls', 'can', 'always', 'understand', 'what', 'saying', 'appreciate', 'how', 'conveys', 'emotions', 'delivery', 'did', 'think', 'Sunshine', 'dumb', 'name', 'cougar', 'could', 'understand', 'how', 'boy', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'when', 'family', 'had', 'move', 'When', 'animal', 'behavior', 'led', 'being', 'placed', 'zoo', 'could', 'also', 'understand', 'how', 'boy', 'felt', 'seeing', 'beloved', 'pet', 'bars', 'being', 'deprived', 'wild', 'free', 'life', 'Okay', 'setting', 'animals', 'loose', 'was', 'very', 'foolhardy', 'act', 'caused', 'people', 'think', 'current', 'conditions', 'zoo', 'how', 'funding', 'could', 'really', 'turn', 'things', 'was', 'good', 'compare', 'zoo', 'was', 'what', 'became', 'townspeople', 'eyes', 'becoming', 'open', 'how', 'wild', 'animals', 'ought', 'be', 'housed', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'one', 'best', 'kinds', 'movies', 'opinion']",N/A
