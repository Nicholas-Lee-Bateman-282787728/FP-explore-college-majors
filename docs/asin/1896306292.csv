195549,A1YB29BIDULEYE,1896306292,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[3, 3]","This is a depressing, but still interesting movie that explores some of the results of Vatican II. Whether you are totally behind Vatican II and feel that the mass should be done in English, or you belong to that break off church that refused to acknowledge Vatican II, and does the mass in Latin (and facing away from the people) to this day, you should find the movie interesting.Amongst other things, we see that changes and progressions are inevitable, but we also wonder if they should tear people from their  foundations and traumatize them. Trevor Howard puts it quite well when he says: ""Yesterday's orthodoxy is today's heresy.""Basically, Martin Sheen is a priest sent from Rome to convince an Irish church that stubbornly holds onto the Latin Mass to 'get with today's program.' It is also interesting that while Martin Sheen is a priest, he carries the aura of an FBI agent. (If I may be permitted a personal remark, I almost expected him to pull out an FBI badge.)Trevor Howard is the leader of the Pre Vatican II stronghold. And he defends his position with careful elegance. Though we do get the impression that he is hiding something. Michael Gambon and Cyril Cusack (in their small roles) offer interesting defenses for their stronghold.I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, but while one turnout of the movie is predictable, there are interesting surprises that unfold.One word of warning: If you are having struggles with your faith, you should probably avoid this movie.",4,"Depressing, But Interesting",1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,1520,"['depressing', 'still', 'interesting', 'movie', 'results', 'Vatican', 'II', 'are', 'totally', 'Vatican', 'II', 'feel', 'mass', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'English', 'belong', 'break', 'off', 'church', 'refused', 'acknowledge', 'Vatican', 'II', 'mass', 'Latin', 'facing', 'away', 'people', 'day', 'should', 'find', 'movie', 'other', 'things', 'see', 'changes', 'progressions', 'are', 'inevitable', 'also', 'wonder', 'should', 'tear', 'people', 'foundations', 'traumatize', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'quite', 'well', 'when', 'Yesterday', 'orthodoxy', 'today', 'heresy', 'Basically', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'priest', 'sent', 'Rome', 'convince', 'Irish', 'church', 'stubbornly', 'Latin', 'Mass', ""'get"", 'today', 'program', 'also', 'interesting', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'priest', 'aura', 'FBI', 'agent', 'may', 'be', 'permitted', 'personal', 'remark', 'almost', 'expected', 'pull', 'out', 'FBI', 'badge', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'leader', 'Pre', 'Vatican', 'II', 'stronghold', 'position', 'careful', 'elegance', 'do', 'get', 'impression', 'hiding', 'something', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Cyril', 'Cusack', 'small', 'roles', 'offer', 'interesting', 'defenses', 'stronghold.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'movie', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'turnout', 'movie', 'predictable', 'are', 'interesting', 'surprises', 'unfold.One', 'word', 'warning', 'are', 'having', 'struggles', 'faith', 'should', 'probably', 'avoid', 'movie']",The Conflict
195550,A1P9WWK5CBNY6E,1896306292,D. Guenzel,"[4, 7]","I share many of the reservations of Mr Alcuin Reid over this film, which he so ably pointed out in his review.  I had seen this on television in 1973 and remember that it left a queasy feeling in my stomach and a sense of hopelessness.But I was very young then and thought that I had better now, 36 years later, see it again in the light of subsequent reflection.  After viewing it I now recall why it made me feel the way it did in 1973.  As Reid points out, it leaves the issues unresolved.This is, alas, a cut version of the film, the crucial opening sequence with Raf Vallone having been eliminated.  Yet knowing what was in that opening, and recognizing that several important points were made there, I doubt it would have affected my overall opinion that much.  The crux of the problem with this film is its treatment of the Father Matthew character, played well by that wonderful actor, Andrew Keir.  He is sort of made out to be a villain, not in the classic sense of course, but in his strongly worded objections to the abandonment of the ancient Mass.  The film makers give the character no opportunity to state his case.  Granted Mr Keir's stern features make him ideal casting for such a part as written.  However, that is no excuse for the writer and director not to use the character more intelligently, to use his strengths as an actor to show the seriousness of the issues involved.  Father Matthew, in Keir's able hands, could have been used to air the issues plainly for the audience to hear and comprehend.  He could have played off brilliantly against Trevor Howard's doubting Father Abbott.  But, alas, he was merely to be portrayed as a hothead and an irritant to Howard, a gadfly to be ignored.Equally wasted in a similar manner was Cyril Cusack, another superior actor who was at least allowed a few moments of genuine pathos in a touching defense of the traditions of Catholicism.  Had the writer and director been thoroughly honest with their audience they would surely have allowed Cusack and Keir - even with their srikingly different personalities - to present the unshakable case for the maintaining of the devastatingly beautiful Latin Mass.  It is a testimony to the skill of these players that they were able to do so much with so little.  But, oh, what they could have done with a more perceptive script!Others have pointed out the ambiguity in the Trevor Howard character and here, I believe, is where a golden opportunity was missed.  There is nothing wrong with showing a priest who has doubts (as was done superbly by Henry Fonda in John Ford's THE FUGITIVE) but there is no reason whatever why these doubts should not have been aired in the film clearly - at best in a confrontational dialog scene between the Father Abbott character and either Cusack or Keir.  Had that been done, and done fairly, it would have elevated the film greatly.  But as it now stands, and notwithstanding Howard's beautiful performance, it simply makes no sense that a non-believer would have all this time kept saying the traditional Latin Mass if he no longer accepted its fundamental premise.  In real life, many of these doubters happily abandoned the traditional Mass even before the ink was dry on Pope Paul VI's catastrophically stupid decree introducing the new rite forty sad years ago.  The writer and director have the Howard character merely fall back on the ""obedience"" issue and pretty much leave it at that, thereby missing another golden opportunity to discuss the very real problem of being forced to obey an unjust decision by a superior.  This could have been made into compelling drama.I suppose one could hardly expect producers Glazier and Levinson, and director Gold, to have really grasped the seriousness of the issues involved, nor do I suspect they have any sympathy with the Catholic Church.  Their combined filmographies hardly reflect delicacy, good taste and grappling with issues in a forthright way.  So the film is about as good as you're going to get from such a crew.I wont recommend that the story be remade properly because, quite simply, there are no longer actors around with the same capabilities as Howard, Cusack, Keir and the rest.  Martin Sheen's part could be played by any of the hacks and amateurs now gracing our movie screens but try to find someone with the stature of Trevor Howard, Andrew Keir and Cyril Cusack.  Forget it.An interesting film to watch, and, yes, it did have some good scenes and excellent acting, but what a grand opportunity went down the drain thanks to a writer a director and a couple of producers who really didn't know what they were doing.",2,a missed opportunity,1260144000,"12 7, 2009",2009,4633,"['share', 'many', 'reservations', 'Mr', 'Alcuin', 'Reid', 'film', 'so', 'ably',

195553,A126JVOAOOR42V,1896306292,John McConnell,"[0, 4]","There is what actually occurs and what people think is occurring. To understand this film, it helps to know at least one fact about Roman Catholicism, a fact that's gotten more and more unknown over the last fifty years since Vatican II. That fact is this: Any departure from received tradition is heresy and heresy puts one outside the Church. This is a film about departure from received tradition. See for example the papal encyclical of Pope Leo XIIISatis Cognitum: Encyclical on the Unity of the Church, which declares:""The practice of the Church has always been the same, as is shown by the unanimous teaching of the Fathers, who were wont to hold as outside Catholic communion, and alien to the Church, whoever would recede in the least degree from any point of doctrine proposed by her authoritative Magisterium. Epiphanius, Augustine, Theodoret, drew up a long list of the heresies of their times. St. Augustine notes that other heresies may spring up, to a single one of which, should any one give his assent, he is by the very fact cut off from Catholic unity. 'No one who merely disbelieves in all (these heresies) can for that reason regard himself as a Catholic or call himself one. For there may be or may arise some other heresies, which are not set out in this work of ours, and, if any one holds to one single one of these he is not a Catholic' (S. Augustinus, De Haeresibus, n. 88).""This 1973 film was made in the decade following the heretical inventions and novelties of Vatican II. It was at Vatican II, an illegitimate robber council led by antipope Paul VI, and driven by anathematized Modernists such as Fr. Ratzinger and Fr. Wojty&#322;a - themselves subsequent antipopes - that an attempt was made to destroy Roman Catholicism by substituting its authentic traditional teachings with the anathematized novelties of Freemasonry and Modernism. Antipopes, illegitimately elected popes, are nothing new to Roman Catholicism; there have been around forty over the last two thousand years. Robber councils teaching heresy are nothing new either - there have been dozens. See, for example,Tumultuous Times: The Twenty General Councils of the Catholic Church and Vatican II and Its Aftermath. What made Vatican II unique in two thousand years of Roman Catholicism was the massive acceptance the apostasy received, due largely to modern mastery of the arts of mass communication and mass propaganda. Or possibly the time was just right for it: As predicted by Our Lady of La Salette in 1847, ""Rome will lose the faith and become the seat of the antichrist. The Church will be in eclipse."" (SeeOur Lady of Good Success History, Miracles & Prophecies (DVD).) This fictional film, set in Ireland, deals with that very non-fictional eclipse in its final stages of obscuration and apostasy, following a subsequent robber council called ""Vatican IV"": Lourdes has been ""closed down"", private confessions have been eliminated, transubstantiation no longer is Roman Catholic dogma, the Mass is merely a pious ritual said in the vernacular, priests primarily are social workers agitating for social justice, etc. If this sounds eerily prophetic to you of the current Monday through Sunday novus ordo ""church"", you're correct.The film starts with a small group of Irishmen assembling at a Mass Rock along the windy Irish coast. Of course the Irish did this a great deal in past when the protestant English government outlawed the Latin Mass in Ireland, but in this case it is the Vatican itself that has outlawed the Latin Mass; these Irishmen are the last remnant of Roman Catholics left assembling to celebrate the Latin Mass, and Martin Sheen has been sent from Rome with the emphatic mission to stomp out this last vestige of authentic Roman Catholicism, the only authentic Roman Catholicism apparently left on earth. Once these orthodox Irish priests have been silenced, the latest novelties of Vatican IV can be fully implemented without further hindrance.The film examines blind obedience to superiors' unlawful orders - and why the Roman Catholic Church has always taught that such obedience is not nor ever due - in fact must be refused. See, for example, Pope Paul IV's 1559 apostolic bull ""Cum ex Apostolatus Officio"". The film also examines betrayal of those to whom we owe duty - for the duty of obedience implies the duty of lawful responsibility from those in charge; there is not, nor can ever be, obedience owed to an unlawful superior or to a superior acting unlawfully. The ending is silently eloquent and very memorable, which I will not touch upon lest I spoil the film for you. To fully appreciate this film, it helps to have read or at least be familiar with the book by Fr. James WathenThe Great Sacrilege. It's interesting to note that the current antipope, Mr. Francis, is calling an extraordinary synod in the autumn of this year. If the hype can be believed, it will pretty much be this film's Vatican IV.",3,"""Pie in the Sky""",1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,4940,"['what', 'actually', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'occurring',

If you're of any other faith, or a Catholic born later than, say, 1960, then the movie may be of only academic interest. Indeed, if you're a young Catholic today, then the issues around which the plot pivots may not be comprehensible at all.A youthful Martin Sheen plays a priest sent by Rome to an Irish monastery located on an isolated, windswept island. His mission, to demand that the monks cease and desist celebrating the Mass in Latin. The Vatican hierarchy is attempting to modernize the Mass worldwide, i.e. have it celebrated in the vernacular, as well as promote the new policy that the Transubstantiation of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ is symbolic, not real. Trouble is, the monastery's priests have been celebrating the Mass on the mainland in the traditional manner. More to the point, the ceremony has been televised, and is causing a pious, revivalist stir among the faithful. The pencil pushing prelates back in Rome are not pleased with this political incorrectness.The marvelous actor Trevor Howard plays the crusty, wise, spiritually troubled, monastery abbot, who must find a way to obey the dictate of the enforcer sent down from the Big House, while avoiding a rebellion among the monks, who consider the emissary's message an abomination, and he himself disconcertingly trendy. (Faith and begorrah, he doesn't even wear the traditional, Roman clerical collar!)Are you still with me on this, or have I lost you? If I haven't, God bless ya, darlin'. In any case, all of the acting performances are wonderful, especially Howard's. The character actors portraying the abbot's cowled flock were chosen with pure genius. And the wild Irish coastal scenery ... ah, `tis St. Patrick's own, surely.As I said up front, you had to be born a Papist prior to 1960, as I was, to understand what the fuss was all about. I well remember the horror with which my mother regarded the vernacular Mass. To this day, she'll seek out the Latin Mass in those rare places - sort of a doctrinal Underground - where it's still celebrated.

195555,A1W98Q4MZK80VA,1896306292,Joseph P. Tevington,"[5, 9]","I believe that it was in 1973, the year that I finished grade school, that this film was shown on broadcast television.  I vividly recall seeing this film - and being confused by it!  After seeing it again yesterday afternoon, I cannot say that it is NOT a confused and confusing film (Catholics(which was apparently also released as ""The Conflict"") was produced by Barry Levinson, and - by a strange coincidence - I had also been watching episodes of Levinson'sHomicide: Life on the Street)....The Conflict/Catholics is set at an unspecified time in the near future.  Young Martin Sheen (He of the exceptionally high rising pompadour) portrays an American priest on assignment from the Vatican, to deal with a group of monks in Western Ireland who refuse to go along with liturgical changes which came along after Vatican II (It should be noted that this  film does NOT appear to evidence an understanding ofSacrosanctum Concillium, Vatican II's document on the sacred liturgy.).In an early conversation between the priest characters of Sheen and Trevor Howard (Father Abbot), we learn that Sheen's character seems to be a fan ofLiberation Theology(though I can't recall that term actually being used).  He actually states that he sees the Faith as needing to address the betterment of mankind's earthly condition, INSTEAD of ""saving souls"" (To avoid confusion on this point, please, please see the Vatican'sCompendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church.).  As the film progresses, we realize that the liturgical ""changes"" have gone way off track and are truly heretical, actually denyingtransubstantiation!  Should the monks go along with such or be disobedient to their vows?  That seems to be ""The Conflict"" of ""Catholics.""In an attempt to leave its audience with some additional seeds of confusion, we learn that Father Abbot has quietly abandoned his own prayer life. The film appears to be promoting a false dichotomy of a pre Vatican II and post Vatican II Church (For theological clarity, it would have been better served by waiting two decades and being informed by theCatechism).In addition to The Conflict/Catholics,Believers, andEntertaining Angels, Martin Sheen has now added ""The Way"" to his ""canon"" of films overtly dealing with Catholic subject matter.  In a recent National Catholic Register interview, Sheen (who chose his stage name after Archbishop Fulton Sheen) was asked about his own ""reversion to the Catholic faith.""  As per Sheen: ""It began after my illness in the Philippines while filming Apocalypse Now. I began going to church because I was afraid of dying. Then I stopped going for a long time. My eyes were first reopened when I was in India filming Gandhi. Then, in 1981, while in Paris, I read the book The Brothers Karamazov. I had been given the book by director Terrence Malick. The book kept me up. After reading it, I went to see a priest and told him I wanted to come home. He looked at me with eyes that said, 'This is what I do.' He told me to return the next day at 4pm, as he had a wedding at 4:30pm. He told me not to be late. I went to confession with him and wept. I came back to a Church that was very different. I left a Church of fear and returned to a Church of love"" (Tim Drake, 9/14/11).If I am interpreting the above comments correctly, Sheen seems be suffering from the misunderstanding that sees a dichotomy between the Church before Vatican II and after Vatican II!  May I suggest that he may be watching too many of his own old films?  For the rest of us, it's vital to remember that he is an actor and NOT a religious leader.",1,"""Catholics"" (aka, ""The Conflict"") - a film of some historical interest",1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,3587,"['believe', 'was', '1973', 'year', 'finished', 'grade', 'school', 'film', 'was', 'shown', 'broadcast', 'television', 'vividly', 'recall', 'seeing', 'film', 'being', 'confused', 'seeing', 'again', 'yesterday', 'afternoon', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'NOT', 'confused', 'confusing', 'film', 'Catholics', 'was', 'apparently', 'also', 'released', 'Conflict', 'was', 'produced', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'strange', 'coincidence', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'watching', 'episodes', ""Levinson'sHomicide"", 'Life', 'Street', '.The', 'Conflict/Catholics', 'set', 'unspecified', 'time', 'near', 'future', 'Young', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'exceptionally', 'high', 'rising', 'pompadour', 'American', 'priest', 'assignment', 'Vatican', 'deal', 'group', 'monks', 'Western', 'Ireland', 'who', 'refuse', 'go', 'along', 'liturgical', 'changes', 'came', 'along', 'Vatican', 'II', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'film', 'NOT', 'appear', 'evidence', 'understanding', 'ofSacrosanctum', 'Concillium', 'Vatican', 'II', 'document', 'sacred', 'liturgy', '.In', 'early', 'conversation', 'priest', 'characters', 'Sheen', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'Father', 'Abbot', 'learn', 'Sheen', 'character', 'be', 'fan', 'ofLiberation', 'Theology', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'term', 'actually', 'being', 'used', 'actually', 'Faith', 'needing', 'address', 'betterment', 'mankind', 'earthly', 'condition', 'INSTEAD', 'saving', 'souls', 'avoid', 'confusion', 'point', 'please', 'please', 'see', ""Vatican'sCompendium"", 'Social', 'Doctrine', 'Church.', 'film', 'realize', 'liturgical', 'changes', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'track', 'are', 'truly', 'heretical', 'actually', 'denyingtransubstantiation', 'Should', 'monks', 'go', 'along', 'such', 'be', 'disobedient', 'vows', 'be', 'Conflict', 'Catholics', 'attempt', 'leave', 'audience', 'additional', 'seeds', 'confusion', 'learn', 'Father', 'Abbot', 'quietly', 'abandoned', 'own', 'prayer', 'life', 'film', 'be', 'promoting', 'false', 'dichotomy', 'pre', 'Vatican', 'II', 'post', 'Vatican', 'II', 'Church', 'theological', 'clarity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'waiting', 'two', 'decades', 'being', 'informed', 'theCatechism', 'addition', 'Conflict/Catholics', 'Believers', 'andEntertaining', 'Angels', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'now', 'added', 'Way', 'canon', 'films', 'overtly', 'dealing', 'Catholic', 'subject', 'matter', 'recent', 'National', 'Catholic', 'Register', 'interview', 'Sheen', 'who', 'chose', 'stage', 'name', 'Archbishop', 'Fulton', 'Sheen', 'was', 'asked', 'own', 'reversion', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'Sheen', 'began', 'illness', 'Philippines', 'filming', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'began', 'going', 'church', 'was', 'afraid', 'dying', 'Then', 'stopped', 'going', 'long', 'time', 'eyes', 'were', 'first', 'reopened', 'when', 'was', 'India', 'filming', 'Gandhi', 'Then', '1981', 'Paris', 'read', 'book', 'Brothers', 'Karamazov', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'book', 'director', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'book', 'kept', 'up', 'reading', 'went', 'see', 'priest', 'told', 'wanted', 'come', 'home', 'looked', 'eyes', 'said', 'what', 'do', 'told', 'return', 'next', 'day', '4pm', 'had', 'wedding', '4:30pm', 'told', 'not', 'be', 'late', 'went', 'confession', 'wept', 'came', 'back', 'Church', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'left', 'Church', 'fear', 'returned', 'Church', 'love', 'Tim', 'Drake', '9/14/11', '.If', 'am', 'interpreting', 'above', 'comments', 'correctly', 'Sheen', 'be', 'suffering', 'misunderstanding', 'dichotomy', 'Church', 'Vatican', 'II', 'Vatican', 'II', 'May', 'suggest', 'may', 'be', 'watching', 'too', 'many', 'own', 'old', 'films', 'rest', 'vital', 'remember', 'actor', 'NOT', 'religious', 'leader']",The Conflict

Obedience is insisted to the point of papalotry.9. Heresy is non-existant as nonCatholics are merely imperfectly united with Catholics.10.
