Grew up watching Brooke Shields, so I'd be lying if I didn't admit she was my main reason for getting it though. I wish she did more movies. Anything with Marilu Henner and Lou Diamond Phillips in it, is always welcome too. Doesn't get much cooler than Lou and it was nice to see him play the good guy. Television needs more mini-series and this worked quite well as one. I thought everyone did a fine job in it and thought it was well produced.",4,Really Enjoyed It!,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,549,"['bought', 'film', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'Never', 'saw', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'years', 'ago', 'Had', 'kind', 'cast', 'Grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Brooke', 'Shields', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'did', ""n't"", 'admit', 'was', 'main', 'reason', 'getting', 'wish', 'did', 'more', 'movies', 'Anything', 'Marilu', 'Henner', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'always', 'welcome', 'too', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'cooler', 'Lou', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'play', 'good', 'guy', 'Television', 'more', 'mini-series', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'one', 'thought', 'everyone', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'produced']",Gone But Not Forgotten
948169,A1U2KLNT1TJEUF,B000BQ7J98,biped,"[23, 26]","This is an excellent murder mystery/thriller that will keep you interested from start to finish.  The cast is uniformly good and the script very well-written.  Everything about it is way above average for a TV-movie.  At first it seems as though it will be a standard courtroom drama, but after the set-up it goes in an entirely different direction and keeps you guessing the whole time.  Watching this movie is like curling up with a good book on a dark and stormy night.  I recommend it highly.",5,Highly recommended,1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,496,"['excellent', 'murder', 'mystery/thriller', 'will', 'keep', 'interested', 'start', 'finish', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'good', 'script', 'very', 'well-written', 'Everything', 'way', 'average', 'TV-movie', 'first', 'will', 'be', 'standard', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'set-up', 'entirely', 'different', 'direction', 'guessing', 'whole', 'time', 'Watching', 'movie', 'curling', 'up', 'good', 'book', 'dark', 'stormy', 'night', 'recommend', 'highly']",Gone But Not Forgotten

The book is one of the best Ive ever read, so that definitely makes this a good review.

Scott Glenn is the client who we know is guilty and has a horrifying past as well.
