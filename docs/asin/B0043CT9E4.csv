1384229,ADKZOXAOV8EXD,B0043CT9E4,Doctor.Generosity,"[16, 16]","So many American movies glamourize the mafia as a sort of heroic bunch of tough guys, admired for their standup spirit and code of honor. This powerful drama shows how the real mafia behaves in its Sicilian homeland towards its own people. Poor farmers are murdered if someone desires their land. Neighbors are murdered for making a slight lapse of etiquette. Mafia associates are murdered over business decisions, or for revenge. There is nothing glamourous about it, it's just a sick way of life based in an impoverished and undeveloped land where a willingness to kill becomes the main ""business asset.""The Italian public finally rebelled against this system over recent decades and has tried to eradicate it, but  it's been a struggle which is yet to completely succeed. The mafia has fought back by corrupting high officials and murdering prosecutors and judges.This movie is based on a true story from the early 1990's how a young Sicilian girl  took on a whole evil mafia clan which had oppressed her village and killed her father and brother. She paid a big price for her courage and the Italian nation paid a big price including the assassination of officials. Not a happy movie but riveting throughout.

1384230,A36NUDST4Y5JBA,B0043CT9E4,"D. S. HARDEN ""a movie fan""","[1, 1]","""The Sicilian Girl"" details the true crime story of Rita Atria, a Sicilian who was the daughter of a Mafiosi.  She saw her father killed (he didn't want to do drug business and was killed for it).  Her brother was killed.  Some of the things she saw, she detailed into her personal journals - much of which seemed to be verifiable.Rita left Sicily to help build a case against the mob cheiftain who had her dad and brother killed.I can't (or won't begin to try) to imagine the pressure she was under.What struck me about this movie was the fact that all the women walked around dressed only in BLACK. Apparently, they stayed in perpetual mourning.  And, we have reason to believe them.  The family loyalty scenes also struck me, as when some of these men were finally being taken into custody, the women-folk would try to run interference, as if these men were TRULY INNOCENT.Finally, if Veronica D'Agostino's portrayal of Rita is accurate, she, too, was a walking contradiction...wow!I won't give anymore of the story, but, please watch for yourself!Recommended!

But too often the gun is glorified in film.  Not so, this story.  It is the tale of a young women brought up in an Italian Mafia family whose father is gunned down by a rival in the ""family.""  This happens when she is a small girl.  Her brother tells her to be strong and pick the time to get revenge.  Over time, Rita starts to document the meetings, killings, and conversations of the Mafia players with photos and notes in diary after diary.  After her brother is brutally murdered,  she gathers the courage to go public, go to the public prosecutor in Palermo, Sicily. This is a true story.The result...the Mafia attacks the justice systems itself - killing policeman and lawyers for the government...and looking for Rita herself.  To these hoods, killing is acceptable, even ordinary...but telling the truth to the police?  Well, that's the most unspeakable crime from the Mafia's point of view.  Yet this daughter of a crime family has the rare courage to do...just that.This is really an extraordinary picture that reminds me of the ""Battle of Algiers"" in unraveling its story.  None of the murders are depicted heroically...they are shown as the dirty, ugly crimes that they really are. There are some surprising revelations about the girl's father. The courtroom scenes are spectacular in an understated sort of way.The acting throughout is believable and this was filmed on location.  The picture even has a rough quality about it...like a documentary. No bones about it, I thought it was one of the best films of 2010.I dislike the romanticism of many American gangster pictures.

Well, since this one was in Italian, it wasn't as much of a chore for me.Although my Italian is rough, I could still understand the majority of it even if it was spoken in Scilian, a bit different of a dialect than northern Italian.I remeber when all of this was happening in Italy back in the early 90's.I was there visiting relatives and traveling around Italy when many cops, prosecuters and judges were being assasinated by the mafia.It made the news every night someone was killed in connection to the trial.Rita at then ten years of age in 1985 witnessed her father's assasination by rival mafia members. A war had started over control of money and the drug trade. Naieve to her own father's involvement at such a young age, Rita only remebers her father as the loving father and not the Mafia Don he was in his village and region.Years go by, and Rita swears vengence upon her father's death and soon her brothers who also joins a similar fate. Through her adolescent years, Rita has both knowledge and witnesses the local mafia's dealings, comings and goings all the while taking pictures and recording these events in her journels. Now, at seventeen she decides to do the unthinkable.The one thing that no one would dream of doing or are too afraid to. Going against both her mother's wishes,family and the mafia itself she heads to Palermo to tell of all the things she knows bringing about the largest trial in history against the Sicilaian Mafia.This was a great docudrama of one girl who had the courage in the end(and at a such a young age) of taking on some of the worst criminals  in history. In the end, her sacrifice brought about the conviction and indefinate incarceration of dozens of mafia bosses and mafia criminals. Not for vengence, but for liberating and freeing the tight grasp that the mafia has so long held onto of Sicily's citizens.

Six years later, her brother is brutally murdered by the same rival mafioso that killed her dad, and at that point she decides to go to the procesutor's office to get revenge/justice.

The direction and pacing I thought were fine, although the 'main' plot may develop too slowly for some.  Ultimately, though, the main actor, Veronica D'Agostino, is so strong she basically carries the plot past any slow parts.  Bear in mind, this is much more a melodrama than crime thriller (think ""Godfather,"" not ""Public Enemies""), but is also less sentimental about the Mafia-types than any movie I can think of.La Cosa Nostra (and the 'Ndrangheta) are thugs and killers who are ""honorable men"" only in their own twisted minds, and Rita Atria -- the real 17-year-old upon whom this movie is based -- wanted the whole world to know it, even if it killed her.",5,"Fascinating, beautiful and moving... what else do you want?",1305417600,"05 15, 2011",2011,1064,"['are', 'quite', 'few', 'fine', 'reviews', 'already', 'written', 'here', 'just', 'wanted', 'add', '5-stars', 'worth.I', 'was', 'drawn', 'movie', 'initially', 'father', 'family', 'Calabrian', 'where', 'have', 'own', 'bad', 'guys', ""'Ndrangheta"", ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'Sicilian', 'Cosa', 'Nostra', '.So', 'started', 'watching', 'movie', 'personal', 'reasons', 'found', 'quite', 'fascinated', 'approximately', 'true', 'story', 'direction', 'pacing', 'thought', 'were', 'fine', ""'main"", 'plot', 'may', 'develop', 'too', 'slowly', 'Ultimately', 'main', 'actor', 'Veronica', ""D'Agostino"", 'so', 'strong', 'basically', 'plot', 'slow', 'parts', 'Bear', 'mind', 'much', 'more', 'melodrama', 'crime', 'thriller', 'think', 'Godfather', 'not', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'also', 'less', 'sentimental', 'Mafia-types', 'movie', 'can', 'think', 'of.La', 'Cosa', 'Nostra', ""'Ndrangheta"", 'are', 'thugs', 'killers', 'who', 'are', 'honorable', 'men', 'only', 'own', 'twisted', 'minds', 'Rita', 'Atria', 'real', '17-year-old', 'upon', 'whom', 'movie', 'based', 'wanted', 'whole', 'world', 'know', 'even', 'killed']",The Sicilian Girl
