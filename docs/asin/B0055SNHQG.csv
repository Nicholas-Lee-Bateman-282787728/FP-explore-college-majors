Skeet Ulrich, Terence Howard and Alfred Molina?!  Are you kidding me!  All in the same series!  Corey Stoll grew and grew on me also.I already loved Law & Order, Law & Order SVU and my favorite of all Law & Order Criminal Intent.  (I personally think that Vincent D'Onofrio is the VERY best actor on TV.  I'm a retired 25 year veteran Detective of a major U.S. city and he beats out Dennis Franz of NYPD Blue and Jerry Orbach of Law & Order as my favorite TV detective of all time.  But it's close!)Lan & Order LA grabbed me from the very first episode and it never let go of me.  I'm a true Law & Order geek so when I heard that this show was coming on I was IN from the start.  But then I saw who was going to be in it and I was floored.  How they were able to assemble that cast is beyond me.  I just loved it.  (Except when they murdered Skeet's character!  It's only the second time in my life that I have ever cried over a TV character being killed off.  Robert Duvall's Augustus McCrae of Lonesome Dove being the other).Why did they cancel this show?  There is SO MUCH GARBAGE on TV and they cancel THIS show?  NBC, or one of you other brave cable TV companies bring this series back.

Its best years were when Sam Waterston was the district attorney and Jerry Orbach was the detective.  I also enjoyed Chris Noth when he played the other detective for awhile.  The show wasn't quite as good when other cast members were used instead of these but it was still a good show.  However, the show hit its nadir point when it moved it to Los Angeles.I think the biggest misstep is that they tried to make this show look and feel more like the CSI franchise than the Law and Order franchise.  So a lot of flash, glitter, noise and glitz was added while most of the substance was lost.  Law and Order was always bigger on substance than CSI.  No loud music by The Who blared while autopsies were done and scientific forensic tests were conducted.  Law and Order Los Angeles sought to change all of this.The only two cast members who were any good were Skeet Ulrich and Alfred Molina, the detective and head DA respectively.  Ulrich didn't stay and I can't blame him.  He's back in feature films, his latest with Sophia Coppolla. (I for one am glad to have him back in the movies.)  Molina's role is minimal and certainly not enough to make one come back to see the show week after week.The stories were ripped from the headlines but they were very superficial renditions. One was of a Manson female follower finally let out of prison because she has cancer who is found murdered on the beach (in real life she was never let out of prison although her family tried to get her compassionate release). I really would have liked a penetrating look at this character but it was all sacrificed for a glib, glitzy rendition instead.I believe this show has been cancelled.  If you haven't seen it yet. I recommend you go back to your old Law & Order dvds instead for a much finer viewing experience.",2,I Gave Up On This Technicolor Mess,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,1876,"['was', 'fan', 'original', 'Law', 'Order', 'had', 'run', '19', 'prior', 'seasons', 'best', 'years', 'were', 'when', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'was', 'district', 'attorney', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'was', 'detective', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'when', 'played', 'other', 'detective', 'awhile', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'when', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'used', 'instead', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'show', 'However', 'show', 'hit', 'nadir', 'point', 'when', 'moved', 'Los', 'Angeles.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'misstep', 'tried', 'make', 'show', 'look', 'feel', 'more', 'CSI', 'franchise', 'Law', 'Order', 'franchise', 'lot', 'flash', 'glitter', 'noise', 'glitz', 'was', 'added', 'most', 'substance', 'was', 'lost', 'Law', 'Order', 'was', 'always', 'bigger', 'substance', 'CSI', 'No', 'loud', 'music', 'Who', 'blared', 'autopsies', 'were', 'done', 'scientific', 'forensic', 'tests', 'were', 'conducted', 'Law', 'Order', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'sought', 'change', 'this.The', 'only', 'two', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'were', 'good', 'were', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'detective', 'head', 'DA', 'respectively', 'Ulrich', 'did', ""n't"", 'stay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'back', 'feature', 'films', 'latest', 'Sophia', 'Coppolla', 'one', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'back', 'movies', 'Molina', 'role', 'minimal', 'certainly', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'one', 'come', 'back', 'see', 'show', 'week', 'week.The', 'stories', 'were', 'ripped', 'headlines', 'were', 'very', 'superficial', 'renditions', 'One', 'was', 'Manson', 'female', 'follower', 'finally', 'let', 'prison', 'cancer', 'who', 'found', 'murdered', 'beach', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'never', 'let', 'prison', 'family', 'tried', 'get', 'compassionate', 'release', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'penetrating', 'look', 'character', 'was', 'sacrificed', 'glib', 'glitzy', 'rendition', 'instead.I', 'believe', 'show', 'been', 'cancelled', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'recommend', 'go', 'back', 'old', 'Law', 'Order', 'dvds', 'instead', 'much', 'finer', 'viewing', 'experience']",Law & Order: Los Angeles - The Complete Series

1443248,A1Y849AYTGQVIF,B0055SNHQG,Don Jariyasunant,"[46, 50]","Law and Order: Los Angeles was a Southern California-based spinoff of the long-running procedural franchise that premiered during the 2010-11 TV season.  One of the things that was interesting about this spinoff was NBC greenlighting it without a Pilot or Cast.  After a pretty good cast was assembled which included veteran actors Skeet Ulrich, Terrence Howard, Alfred Molina, the show underwent major changes.  1st, after the Pilot was shot, NBC recast the Lt. Arleen Gonzalez, then played by Wanda DeJesus, with veteran TV actor Rachel Ticotin.  The show had good, but unspectacular ratings on it's Wednesday at 10pm timeslot, then after episode 8, the show went on hiatus and that's when the craziness began.  NBC decided to hold off on bringing back the show and decided to make some major creative changes, which included killing off one of the lead characters, firing 2 additional cast members and then giving one of the supporting characters a lead role and job change.  Also a veteran of the Law and Order mothership show was brought in.  After all this tinkering was done, the show finally returned to NBC after a 4 month hiatus and to a new timeslot.  Ratings dropped and the show ended up getting cancelled in May 2011.  I enjoyed the show when it began, but I realize there was nothing that made it stand out from being just another cop and law procedural.  Putting on a 4 month hiatus killed any momentum it was gaining, which is too bad because I believe the re-tooling actually made it a better cop show.  Despite how ridiculous it was, switching Alfred Molina from DDA to Cop actually worked.  I think he developed solid chemistry with Corey Stoll as partners.  I also think the cases during their episodes were alot more compelling.  And I also appreciated that Stoll shaved off the goofy porn mustache from earlier in the season.  Also bringing in Alana de la Garza from the original Law and Order was a great move.  No offense to Megan Boone or Regina Hall, but de la Garza is a much better actress and Connie Rubirosa is a better written character.  I'm not sure how the episodes will be placed on this DVD set, but they aired out of order when they were shown on NBC.  ""Hayden Tract"" ,which aired as episode 15 on NBC, was the intended season finale.  Also, episodes 18-22 on NBC were actually intended to air as episodes 9-13, but were burned off after the show was cancelled.  If you can buy this set for under $20, I would recommend it.",4,"Good addition to Law & Order franchise, but a victim of NBC's mis-handling.",1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,2461,"['Law', 'Order', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'was', 'Southern', 'California-based', 'spinoff', 'long-running', 'procedural', 'franchise', 'premiered', '2010-11', 'TV', 'season', 'One', 'things', 'was', 'interesting', 'spinoff', 'was', 'NBC', 'greenlighting', 'Pilot', 'Cast', 'pretty', 'good', 'cast', 'was', 'assembled', 'included', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'show', 'underwent', 'major', 'changes', '1st', 'Pilot', 'was', 'shot', 'NBC', 'recast', 'Lt.', 'Arleen', 'Gonzalez', 'then', 'played', 'Wanda', 'DeJesus', 'veteran', 'TV', 'actor', 'Rachel', 'Ticotin', 'show', 'had', 'good', 'unspectacular', 'ratings', 'Wednesday', '10pm', 'timeslot', 'then', 'episode', '8', 'show', 'went', 'hiatus', 'when', 'craziness', 'began', 'NBC', 'decided', 'hold', 'off', 'bringing', 'back', 'show', 'decided', 'make', 'major', 'creative', 'changes', 'included', 'killing', 'off', 'one', 'lead', 'characters', 'firing', '2', 'additional', 'cast', 'members', 'then', 'giving', 'one', 'supporting', 'characters', 'lead', 'role', 'job', 'change', 'Also', 'veteran', 'Law', 'Order', 'mothership', 'show', 'was', 'brought', 'tinkering', 'was', 'done', 'show', 'finally', 'returned', 'NBC', '4', 'month', 'hiatus', 'new', 'timeslot', 'Ratings', 'dropped', 'show', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'cancelled', 'May', '2011', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'when', 'began', 'realize', 'was', 'nothing', 'made', 'stand', 'out', 'being', 'just', 'cop', 'law', 'procedural', 'Putting', '4', 'month', 'hiatus', 'killed', 'momentum', 'was', 'gaining', 'too', 'bad', 'believe', 're-tooling', 'actually', 'made', 'better', 'cop', 'show', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'switching', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'DDA', 'Cop', 'actually', 'worked', 'think', 'developed', 'solid', 'chemistry', 'Corey', 'Stoll', 'partners', 'also', 'think', 'cases', 'episodes', 'were', 'alot', 'more', 'compelling', 'also', 'appreciated', 'Stoll', 'shaved', 'off', 'goofy', 'porn', 'mustache', 'earlier', 'season', 'Also', 'bringing', 'Alana', 'de', 'la', 'Garza', 'original', 'Law', 'Order', 'was', 'great', 'move', 'offense', 'Megan', 'Boone', 'Regina', 'Hall', 'la', 'Garza', 'much', 'better', 'actress', 'Connie', 'Rubirosa', 'better', 'written', 'character', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'placed', 'DVD', 'set', 'aired', 'order', 'when', 'were', 'shown', 'NBC', 'Hayden', 'Tract', 'aired', 'episode', '15', 'NBC', 'was', 'intended', 'season', 'finale', 'Also', '18-22', 'NBC', 'were', 'actually', 'intended', 'air', 'episodes', '9-13', 'were', 'burned', 'off', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'can', 'buy', 'set', '20', 'would', 'recommend']",Law & Order: Los Angeles - The Complete Series

I think collectively they are the best crime shows on TV just due to their volume of episodes, the number of spin-off series that have also been very good, but mostly because of the consistency in the good writing in my view. So I very much wanted to like this new version of L&O; but I didn't. This series can only be described as a 'mess' and here's why. The show starts off 'ok' with the typical half cops/half prosecuters format but with no familiar ""In the criminal justice system..."" lead in were familiar with. Skeet Ulrich as one half of the main cops who investigate crime I like--his partner less so. Ulrich is the best thing on the show until suddenly--he's killed off about 8 episodes in which lessens the show considerably. Albert Molina & Terrance Howard are the alternating DA's who handle the cases. So what's the 'mess'? After Ulrich dies Molina decides he's fed up being a prosecuter and goes back to being a Detective which we learn he was before becoming a DA. He is partnered with Cory Stoll, Skeet Ulrich's partner. Add to that the series intro changes completely at this time with the familiar voice intro added and Molina & Stoll featured rolling up on a crime scene . Are you still with me? Good because along about episode 14 comes 'the mess'; Skeet is suddenly back on the show, not dead, partnered with Stoll, the 'no intro' intro back and Albert Molina is back to being a DA. Say what? This isn't some ""he wasn't really dead"" plot thing, it appears the manufaturers got the episodes out of order. They obviously revamped the show including the introduction mid season but it didn't really work. The one good thing they did was feature Rachael Ticontin much more in the second half of the show.Overall, the stories aren't bad and the familiar L&O; formula is there in the show--Dick Wolf doesn't make 'junk'. But watch the first 6 episodes and you'll see why it was cancelled. If your a 'collector' of all the Law & Order shows like I am, your going to want this series. But if your not, and are just looking for a 'one season' Cop Show to purchase their are WAY better shows available out there like 'The Beast' with the now sadly departed Patrick Sweazy.

Garrard ""the G-man""","[0, 0]","In a time when TV shows must either ""prove"" themselves in the ratings within the first few weeks of their airings, ""Law & Order: Los Angeles was not given a fair chance.  Competing in its time slot against CBS's highly-touted reboot of ""Hawaii Five-O,"" the show had its work cut out for it.  Considering the NBC didn't promote it like it should and then put it on hiatus for a while, made some cast changes, and seemed to put all its marketing on its reality programming, this Dick Wolf creation had an uphill battle.  Sadly, it didn't make it but it's still a worthy addition to the franchise.The southern California setting provided a contrast in both content and appearance from the other shows in the franchise, set in New York.  The L & O: LA cast was very good, headed by Alfred Molina and Terrence Howard, more familiar for roles on the big screen than on television.  Although Skeet Ulrich only appeared in six episodes, he still made an impression, especially in his final episode.Bringing in Alana da Garza from ""Law and Order"" early in the season was also a good move and occasional appearances from character actor Peter Coyote as the DA was also a plus.The breakout star should have been Corey Stall, one half of the detective team that started with him paired with Ulrich and later with Molina. At times, Stall is like a younger, leaner, meaner Lennie Briscoe, the character associated with the legendary Jerry Orbach on the original ""L & O.""  Stall's ""Tomas 'TJ' Jaruszalski"" is sarcastic, witty, and can kick some major butt.  This viewer would have liked to have seen the show go on for at least one more year, just to see how this character developed.The stories, like others in the franchise, were ripped from the headlines, with one obviously influenced by a certain golfer with a penchant for the ladies.""Law & Order: Los Angeles"" is one cool show, befitting its location and should be savored for what it is and what it could have been.",5,"The other ""Law & Order"" that shoulda been a ""contender""",1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,1958,"['time', 'when', 'TV', 'must', 'either', 'prove', 'ratings', 'first', 'few', 'weeks', 'airings', 'Law', 'Order', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'fair', 'chance', 'Competing', 'time', 'slot', 'CBS', 'highly-touted', 'reboot', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'show', 'had', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'Considering', 'NBC', 'did', ""n't"", 'promote', 'should', 'then', 'put', 'hiatus', 'while', 'made', 'cast', 'changes', 'seemed', 'put', 'marketing', 'reality', 'programming', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'creation', 'had', 'uphill', 'battle', 'Sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'still', 'worthy', 'addition', 'franchise.The', 'southern', 'California', 'setting', 'provided', 'contrast', 'content', 'appearance', 'other', 'shows', 'franchise', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'L', 'O', 'LA', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'headed', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'more', 'familiar', 'roles', 'big', 'screen', 'television', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'only', 'appeared', 'six', 'episodes', 'still', 'made', 'impression', 'especially', 'final', 'episode.Bringing', 'Alana', 'da', 'Garza', 'Law', 'Order', 'early', 'season', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'move', 'occasional', 'appearances', 'character', 'actor', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'DA', 'was', 'also', 'plus.The', 'breakout', 'star', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Corey', 'Stall', 'one', 'half', 'detective', 'team', 'started', 'paired', 'Ulrich', 'later', 'Molina', 'times', 'Stall', 'younger', 'leaner', 'meaner', 'Lennie', 'Briscoe', 'character', 'associated', 'legendary', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'original', 'L', 'O', 'Stall', 'Tomas', ""'TJ"", 'Jaruszalski', 'sarcastic', 'witty', 'can', 'kick', 'major', 'butt', 'viewer', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'go', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'year', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'character', 'developed.The', 'stories', 'others', 'franchise', 'were', 'ripped', 'headlines', 'one', 'obviously', 'influenced', 'certain', 'golfer', 'penchant', 'ladies', 'Law', 'Order', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'one', 'cool', 'show', 'befitting', 'location', 'should', 'be', 'savored', 'what', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been']",Law & Order: Los Angeles - The Complete Series
