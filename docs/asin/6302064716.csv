293890,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302064716,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I'm not really one for family films.  I mean, they are nice and all that, but far too often they are manipulative and simple and just reeking with saccharine clich&eacute;s.  I won't say that `White Fang' is devoid of all that, because it certainly has its fair share of `family film generalities', but at the end of the day there is something special about this 1991 Disney classic.Maybe it's nostalgia.`White Fang', which is loosely adapted from the classic Jack London novel, tells the story of Jack.  Jack is a young boy in search of gold in Alaska when he meets and befriends a young wolf/dog pop called White Fang.  He catches moments with the dog a few times before actually rescuing him from a group of thugs who are using him in dog fights.  From that point forward, Jack and Fang begin forming a strong and deeply set bond.  As Fang comes down from his raging tendency and learns to trust again, Jack also begins to develop emotionally; coming of age through his relationship with the four-legged creature.I totally understand the gripes from so many about the nature of this adaptation.  When I am passionate about a piece of literature I tend to be overly critical of a film adaptation, especially if it defers drastically from the source material (which is why I stare coldly at 1987's `Less Than Zero', which would have been a far more respectable movie had I never read the novel).  That being said, I have read the novel in my youth and loved it, but I still appreciate this adaptation for what it is.  When adapting a film for `children', one has to be careful not to lose the integrity of the original text while carefully editing and even changing events in order to secure their attention and innocence.  I feel that all involved did a respectable job in doing that.  Sure, a lot has changed, but the soul of `White Fang' is kept intact and the spirit that permeates London's novel is here.  While challenging the audience with griping action sequences and breathtaking scenery, as well as some weighty scenes involving the dog fighters (in particular that final showdown), this film still remains very family friendly.It's intense, but with a purpose (and a payoff).The performances by the human and animal cast are all great, especially Ethan Hawke (underappreciated and underdeveloped in his raw natural talent) who captures the very heart of young Jack and makes him relatable and wholly memorable, even when our main focal point is nearly always White Fang.For a guy who isn't all that into kid flicks, this one works very well.",5,The whole package...,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,2553,"[""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'one', 'family', 'films', 'mean', 'are', 'nice', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'are', 'manipulative', 'simple', 'just', 'reeking', 'saccharine', 'clich', 'eacute', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'White', 'Fang', 'devoid', 'certainly', 'fair', 'share', 'family', 'film', 'generalities', 'end', 'day', 'something', 'special', '1991', 'Disney', 'classic.Maybe', 'nostalgia.', 'White', 'Fang', 'loosely', 'adapted', 'classic', 'Jack', 'London', 'novel', 'story', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'young', 'boy', 'search', 'gold', 'Alaska', 'when', 'young', 'wolf/dog', 'pop', 'called', 'White', 'Fang', 'moments', 'dog', 'few', 'times', 'actually', 'rescuing', 'group', 'thugs', 'who', 'are', 'using', 'dog', 'fights', 'point', 'forward', 'Jack', 'Fang', 'begin', 'forming', 'strong', 'deeply', 'set', 'bond', 'Fang', 'down', 'raging', 'tendency', 'trust', 'again', 'Jack', 'also', 'develop', 'emotionally', 'coming', 'age', 'relationship', 'four-legged', 'creature.I', 'totally', 'understand', 'gripes', 'so', 'many', 'nature', 'adaptation', 'When', 'am', 'passionate', 'piece', 'literature', 'tend', 'be', 'overly', 'critical', 'film', 'adaptation', 'especially', 'drastically', 'source', 'material', 'why', 'stare', 'coldly', '1987', 'Less', 'Than', 'Zero', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'respectable', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'being', 'said', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 'youth', 'loved', 'still', 'appreciate', 'adaptation', 'what', 'When', 'adapting', 'film', 'children', 'one', 'be', 'careful', 'not', 'lose', 'integrity', 'original', 'text', 'carefully', 'editing', 'even', 'changing', 'events', 'order', 'secure', 'attention', 'innocence', 'feel', 'involved', 'did', 'respectable', 'job', 'doing', 'Sure', 'lot', 'changed', 'soul', 'White', 'Fang', 'kept', 'intact', 'spirit', 'London', 'novel', 'here', 'challenging', 'audience', 'griping', 'action', 'sequences', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'as', 'well', 'weighty', 'scenes', 'involving', 'dog', 'fighters', 'particular', 'final', 'showdown', 'film', 'still', 'very', 'family', 'friendly.It', 'intense', 'purpose', 'payoff', '.The', 'performances', 'human', 'animal', 'cast', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'underappreciated', 'underdeveloped', 'raw', 'natural', 'talent', 'who', 'very', 'heart', 'young', 'Jack', 'relatable', 'wholly', 'memorable', 'even', 'when', 'main', 'focal', 'point', 'nearly', 'always', 'White', 'Fang.For', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'kid', 'flicks', 'one', 'very', 'well']",N/A

It's an excellent adventure film that really gets you involved with the story.The story, off the famous book written by Jack London, involves a young adult male's adventures during the gold rush days of Alaska at the end of the 19th century.Some of the Alaskan scenery in here is just magnificent. Here's a movie I would love to see with  a sharp Blu-Ray transfer. I have talked to a couple of people who have been around the world and they both said Alaska had the most incredible scenery of any place they'd been, and you see evidence of that in this movie.They did a nice job with the action scenes in here: not too much, not too little and pretty realistic. The dog-fighting scenes aren't pleasant, but they aren't bloody, either. The villains, led by James Remar, are nasty but not profane.This is not a typical Disney film, at least at the time of its release, because the violence is intense at times and there is some profanity. It's a rugged story about rugged people in a rugged land. These adventurers had to be rough to survive.Ethan Hawke plays the young man-hero whom we all root for, and the way he builds a relationship to wolf-dog ""White Fang"" is touching to view.

One of the best aspects of this film is just the great scenery itself, with the cold, icy backdrop of Alaska as part of the story. They do a commendable job of telling the story while toning down the amount of violence presented in the novel. Because of this, this movie really can be considered a children's movie that still keeps the story of London's work intact.Ethan Hawke plays Jack Conroy, who sets out in Alaska to search for gold after the passing of his father. There he meets Klaus, who teaches him about the possibilities of gold and also about the nature of wolves. They both go through their struggles and learn to finally become friends. Eventually Jack and White Fang, half wolf and half dog, cross paths, and there is a linking between the two later on in the film.The story really is one that exemplifies trust, and we see this as Jack and the wolf gradually form a bond (this after the many harsh moments that White Fang has had to endure, such as learning to fight to the death with other wolves). As one reviewer mentioned, there are not only great performances by the actors, but also the animals in the film.Some of the scenes are simulated (such as the fighting between the wolves), but they may still be seemingly too graphic for the young children.

It's essentially too sugar coated and lacks real teeth to convince me of the gritty and terrible fate that befell the main character, White Fang.  This is more of a feel good romp to showcase the misleading notion that wolf hybrids, no matter how poorly treated, are just as lovable, tamable and cuddly as a normal dog.

And after seeing this film I think I might finally get around to buying it.Ethan Hawke plays Jack Conroy a young gold prospector in Canada/Alaska during the gold rush of the late 19th century. His story is without considerable peril and seems to take a backseat to the more intimate story of a young wolf cub who loses his mother and ventures out into the world on his own. Many people (kind, cruel and indifferent) interact and encounter the wolf before Jack adopts him as ""White Fang"".The scenes of the cub hugging his dying mother are heartbreaking, and the training the filmmakers did with the animals is really impressive. A disclaimer pops up before the film begins to explain that although all the animal cruelty looks realistic is was done safely.The scenery is wonderful, but I am puzzled as to why director Randall Kleiser didn't shoot it in anamorphic Panavision. When filming in breathtaking parts of the world it's kinda dumb to not take full advantage. The resulting picture looks a bit TV-ish. But it's a minor quibble.Basil Poledouris' score is also great. I am convinced Hans Zimmer might have also contributed as there are a couple of tracks that have the early 90s Zimmer sound. But it's definitely Poledouris' show, and it's a shame that a definitive score CD was never released.For those of you who love wolf, adventure and great outdoors movies, this one is a must.",4,Lovely scenery,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,1458,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Jack', 'London', 'book', 'certainly', 'wishlist', 'seeing', 'film', 'think', 'might', 'finally', 'get', 'buying', 'it.Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Jack', 'Conroy', 'young', 'gold', 'prospector', 'Canada/Alaska', 'gold', 'rush', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'story', 'considerable', 'peril', 'take', 'backseat', 'more', 'intimate', 'story', 'young', 'wolf', 'cub', 'who', 'mother', 'ventures', 'out', 'world', 'own', 'Many', 'people', 'kind', 'cruel', 'indifferent', 'interact', 'encounter', 'wolf', 'Jack', 'White', 'Fang', '.The', 'scenes', 'cub', 'hugging', 'dying', 'mother', 'are', 'heartbreaking', 'training', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'animals', 'really', 'impressive', 'disclaimer', 'up', 'film', 'explain', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'realistic', 'was', 'done', 'safely.The', 'scenery', 'wonderful', 'am', 'puzzled', 'why', 'director', 'Randall', 'Kleiser', 'did', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'anamorphic', 'Panavision', 'When', 'filming', 'breathtaking', 'parts', 'world', 'kinda', 'dumb', 'not', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'resulting', 'picture', 'bit', 'TV-ish', 'minor', 'quibble.Basil', 'Poledouris', 'score', 'also', 'great', 'am', 'convinced', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'might', 'have', 'also', 'contributed', 'are', 'couple', 'tracks', 'have', 'early', '90s', 'Zimmer', 'sound', 'definitely', 'Poledouris', 'show', 'shame', 'definitive', 'score', 'CD', 'was', 'never', 'released.For', 'who', 'love', 'wolf', 'adventure', 'great', 'outdoors', 'movies', 'one', 'must']",N/A

The film has breathtaking, sweeping views of the Alaskan wilderness with a swelling score to accompany the cinematography.  And that's just the beginning.  Fresh-faced and innocent Ethan Hawke plays a wonderful Jack, a young man trying to find his father's Yukon claim during the Gold Rush of the 1800's.

Jack takes a journey from boy to young man as he encounters death, violence, cruelty, ignorance, friendship, and love in this beautiful movie for anyone of any age.There is no sex, bad language, or nudity, but make no mistake: this is a violent and scary film.  Scenes of dogfights are so realistic you cannot believe the animals are just acting.  There is the death of a mother wolf in front of her cub, vicious dogfights, a grizzly attack, implied killing of a man by a pack of ravenous wolves, and an implied sensuous relationship between Brandauer and his lovely girlfriend.Native Americans and wolves get the treatment they deserve in this movie, bringing a new perspective to viewers without being preachy or maudlin.Warning: When the grizzly makes his appearance, it is when you least expect, and it will make your heart jump.

I picked up the book under the impression that this was a story of a mad, rabid wolf that killed everything in it's path; in turn it turned out to be the most amazing book I would ever read. And White Fang's story was one of harsh survival and a charming ending that left you feeling satisfied and warm with content.This movie, however, is a very poor interpretation of the book. There is no Ethan Hawke. It's just the story of White Fang and his journey to survive in the harsh wild.
