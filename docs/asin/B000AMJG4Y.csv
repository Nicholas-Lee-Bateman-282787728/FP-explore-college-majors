Wooot! Too bad ya fools can't read Japanese as all the text and menus are only Japanese)I started the movie with an open mind. I love the game (In fact I am playing it again, and it still rocks).  I have seen the trailers and knew this movie was going to be all visuals and very little else. On a visual aspect, Advent Children is stunning, and is far better on Blu-Ray.  You got to be smoking rocks to think other wise (or have the wrong setup).The movie its self was worse than I expected. Halfway through the movie I was just bored out of my mind, then I tortured my self by watching another hour towards the end. In fact it was so bad, I categorize it as one of the worst movies i have seen. It's works as a good tech demo to test your home theater gear out, and get your inner geek on.  But as actual entertainment, it falls flat in every possible way.If you don't believe me watch advent children after you have watched animation master pieces such as Princess Mononoke, Akira, JinroIf you like more family friendly shows:  Miyazaki's Spirited Away, Castle In the Sky, and Kiki's Deleivery service (Mononoke is also Miyazaki film but may be too violent and scary for young children)Advent as a Movie for Movie lover not a geeky video game fanatic is just plain pathetic waste of time.",1,2 hour waste of time.,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,1425,"['watched', 'Japanese', 'Blu-Ray', 'PS3', 'Special', 'Edition', 'version', 'only', 'available', 'Japan', 'came', 'demo', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'XIII', 'Wooot', 'Too', 'bad', 'ya', 'fools', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'Japanese', 'text', 'menus', 'are', 'only', 'Japanese', 'started', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'love', 'game', 'fact', 'am', 'playing', 'again', 'still', 'have', 'seen', 'trailers', 'knew', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'visuals', 'very', 'little', 'else', 'visual', 'aspect', 'Advent', 'Children', 'stunning', 'far', 'better', 'Blu-Ray', 'got', 'be', 'smoking', 'rocks', 'think', 'other', 'wise', 'have', 'wrong', 'setup', 'movie', 'self', 'was', 'worse', 'expected', 'Halfway', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'bored', 'mind', 'then', 'tortured', 'self', 'watching', 'hour', 'end', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'categorize', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'works', 'good', 'tech', 'demo', 'test', 'home', 'theater', 'gear', 'out', 'get', 'inner', 'geek', 'actual', 'entertainment', 'flat', 'possible', 'way.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'watch', 'advent', 'children', 'have', 'watched', 'animation', 'master', 'pieces', 'such', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Akira', 'JinroIf', 'more', 'family', 'friendly', 'Miyazaki', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Castle', 'Sky', 'Kiki', 'Deleivery', 'service', 'Mononoke', 'also', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'violent', 'scary', 'young', 'children', 'Advent', 'Movie', 'Movie', 'lover', 'not', 'geeky', 'video', 'game', 'fanatic', 'just', 'plain', 'pathetic', 'waste', 'time']",N/A

This movie sets a wonderful backdrop of beautiful visuals that at times are very lifelike.  The musical score and voice acting are excellent for an English translation.  Watching this movie trully sets a tone for the environmental movement.  The message is clear.  The Earth will strike on those who harm it so.  This tale is set in a futristic world in the Final Fantasy Universe.  The place is very similar to Earth but has noticable differences.  Mainly being the use of magic.  Although these individuals have had much of their world destroyed from the battles of the past.  They live in a dreary dark place where people are being taken over by a mutant virus that will eventually kill them.  Their are subtle but strong spiritual overtones.  With a cathedral being home to flowers and the only rays of sunlight that pierce thru the holes in the roof.Overall I would say this is a wonderful movie to watch whether you are a Final Fantasy fan or just enjoy excellent animation and storyline.,5,Spectacular and thought provoking,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,1120,"['Bringing', 'back', 'wonderful', 'set', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'game', 'Playstation', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'backdrop', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'times', 'are', 'very', 'lifelike', 'musical', 'score', 'voice', 'acting', 'are', 'excellent', 'English', 'translation', 'Watching', 'movie', 'trully', 'tone', 'environmental', 'movement', 'message', 'clear', 'Earth', 'will', 'strike', 'who', 'harm', 'so', 'tale', 'set', 'futristic', 'world', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Universe', 'place', 'very', 'similar', 'Earth', 'noticable', 'differences', 'Mainly', 'being', 'use', 'magic', 'individuals', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'world', 'destroyed', 'battles', 'past', 'live', 'dreary', 'dark', 'place', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'over', 'mutant', 'virus', 'will', 'eventually', 'kill', 'are', 'subtle', 'strong', 'spiritual', 'overtones', 'cathedral', 'being', 'home', 'flowers', 'only', 'rays', 'sunlight', 'pierce', 'holes', 'roof.Overall', 'would', 'say', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'watch', 'are', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'fan', 'just', 'enjoy', 'excellent', 'animation', 'storyline']",N/A

You can't just substitute awesome CG action for a coherent story that is uninteresting and has no continuity to it whatsoever. Don't even bother with this movie unless you have played multiple FF games in the past as it will make no sense at all if you have not and is full of the weird sensibilities that the japanese creators of the games have as well as the strange modern japanese sensibilities in general.The previous FF CG film was great, it had a coherent story that didn't require a detailed knowledge of the FF world and had normal people in it as well as a focused story, this has none of that. It's all over the map with some planet life force and these new age ninja slacker japanese types asking about mother, whatever that means.

928747,A34BUK6Q132V75,B000AMJG4Y,Agnes,"[1, 2]","Viewed only as a film, and away from the game(s) - and I'm going to shirk the plot synopsis on this review - Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children falls short.  Stiffing characterization for long action sequences, it failed to connect me to any of the characters.  A small effort is made to develop Cloud, but it's a rather half-hearted attempt.  This small attempt makes it even more obvious that this movie isn't really about the characters; it's about the action.  Even trying to see the film as separate from the games (or, at least, one specific game) and only as a film, it doesn't deliver and excludes elements which I think make an enjoyable film.Because the characters are so flat (with the exception of two, whose actions and dialogue serve as much needed comic relief in an otherwise emotionless film), it's difficult to care about what they're going through or even be concerned with major conflicts going on within the story.  The film has some nice, detailed graphics, but this alone could not save the film.As already stated, the entire film's main devotion is to the action scenes presented within, which are overly long and consist of huge feats of inhuman strength beyond that which is in the games (no complaints on this point, but the action sequences are still drawn out, long-winded, and at times boring).  It also seemed extremely obvious that filmmakers were taking much of their inspiration from The Matrix, and subsequently filled the film with sequences of gunfire and character movements which slowed and increased, sometimes to the detriment of the film.  I love action movies and me saying that the action was boring is pretty huge.  There's way too much action and too little development in other areas of the story.I really didn't find Advent Children entertaining and was stunned throughout most of the film on my lack of enjoyment.  I've seen the other attempt by another director at tackling such a popular (and awesome) game franchise in order to make a film out of it (even if said film wasn't really all that connected to the series story-wise); I also thought that one was a huge failure.  I'm just surprised and disappointed to be relegating Advent Children to the same category.  The villains were annoying, Tipha hugely underdeveloped - to the point of aggravation (she could have been completely left out and would have made about the same impact with her absence), characters appeared out of nowhere for convenience and disappeared just as inconveniently (for this viewer) and with no attempt to characterize them or make them more a part of the story than just accommodating the main character in fights.Overall: even viewed as a simple film, this movie just was not enjoyable.  Viewed beside the game, it's surprising how filmmakers appear to have missed what the games are really about: the characters.

928748,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B000AMJG4Y,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[1, 1]","Final Fantasy 7:Advent Children looks very good. Better than The Spirits Within, and that's saying something. It's got action, vast cityscapes, and people with hair that moves. And it's got monsters and motorbikes, and more action...and yet more action. In fact, there's so much action everything else falls by the wayside, and here lies one of the films biggest failings.First, it has to be said that if you haven't seen Final Fantasy 7 and know a far bit about the world that this adventure takes place in, you're going to be totally lost here, because the movie is a direct sequel to that video game. So, as far as the movie going public goes, that's got to be a pretty small audience, even for a game like this, which was a massive world seller. But that's still not going to get as many bums on seats as your usual futuristic blockbuster. Still, let's assume that you're a bit of an FF fan and you've taken your chances and sat down, looking forward to seeing all your favourite characters come to life, so lets see what you get.Well, here's what the game gets pretty much right. There they all are, Cloud, Tifa, Yuffie, Barrett, etc and they look fantastic. The animation is superb, everyone moves, walks and gestures like a real person. The city (Midgar?) looks authentic and the feeling of familiarity is spot on. This was definitely a labour of love. They've even included some of the same musical themes.Now that you've got over the thrill of the characters coming to life, we can move onto the plot. Oh dear...Erm...well, three silver-haired punks turn up claiming that they want to reunite with Mother and take revenge on the planet. To do that they need to find some left-over cells from the original Jenova project that was behind the trouble in the game. Can our heroes stop them?  Well yes, of course, is the answer, and to do so, the film starts with jaw dropping action sequences, and never takes a breath for 90 minutes. Now that might sound great but without any character or plot development in between, the action seems to have as much depth as a vintage side scrolling beat `em up. All that happens in this film, is fight after fight, after fight, after fight! The silver haired baddies come to town and our heroes fight them. And that really is it. Oh they also summon some big bug-like monsters, but just the one type - how cheap is that? I wanted to see classic FF creatures, especially a few summons like Ifrit or Shiva but these generic beasts are nothing I recognised, and they don't even do much. Anyway, Cloud and the gang rip through everything anyway, just pausing momentarily to utter deep and meaningful platitudes about life, destiny and friendship before they get back to leaping on motorbikes or dashing vertically up the outside of tall buildings (like you do) to have a go at the baddies. The action is so outrageously over the top that in a few places you might actually be laughing, but I think such a reaction would not upset the makers, as it is not called ""fantasy"" for nothing. There's one standout sequence of a battle against a particularly large flying dragon type thing (the only different monster to the previously mentioned bug things) which has some quite breathtaking shots (if only we could really jump upwards with enough momentum to go that high!), but the rest of the film badly needs some time out from all the excitement to make you care about what's going on.The film is SO unavoidably for fans only that it's impossible for anyone new to the story to get anything out of it. And even someone who knows the original like I do needs a bit more meat on the story than this. I played it twice but still get lost when I try and unravel the plot, and this movie just glosses over everything, which, when you are referencing a game that had about 100 hours of interactive detail, that's a lot of glossing!! You couldn't just walk into this and get it, because the hugely important plot details about Mako, Materia, Jenova, Lifestream, Soldier, Sephiroth and Aeris are not explained in detail at all. All in all, the film is a fans dream, but an under developed one, because it's all your favourite characters in one very long and drawn out fight from beginning to end, and all in the same place and at the same breakneck speed. Its also seemingly shot in a palette of mostly grey, black and silver, which doesn't lend much to variety either. Quite exhausting, but ultimately very throwaway.",3,Flashy but no substance,1213833600,"06 19, 2008",2008,4445,"['Final', 'Fantasy', '7', 'Advent', 'Children', 'very', 'good', 'Better', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'saying', 'something', 'got', 'action', 'vast', 'cityscapes', 'people', 'hair', 'got', 'monsters', 'motorbikes', 'more', 'action', 'yet', 'more', 'action', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'everything', 'else', 'wayside', 'here', 'one', 'films', 'biggest', 'failings.First', 'be', 'said', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Final', 'Fantasy', '7', 'know', 'far', 'bit', 'world', 'adventure', 'place', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'totally', 'lost', 'here', 'movie', 'direct', 'sequel', 'video', 'game', 'So', 'as', 'far', 'movie', 'going', 'public', 'got', 'be', 'pretty', 'small', 'audience', 'even', 'game', 'was', 'massive', 'world', 'seller', 'still', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'many', 'bums', 'seats', 'usual', 'futuristic', 'blockbuster', 'Still', 'let', 'assume', ""'re"", 'bit', 'FF', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'chances', 'sat', 'down', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'favourite', 'characters', 'come', 'life', 'so', 'see', 'what', 'get.Well', 'here', 'what', 'game', 'pretty', 'much', 'right', 'are', 'Cloud', 'Tifa', 'Yuffie', 'Barrett', 'etc', 'look', 'fantastic', 'animation', 'superb', 'everyone', 'moves', 'walks', 'gestures', 'real', 'person', 'city', 'Midgar', 'authentic', 'feeling', 'familiarity', 'spot', 'was', 'definitely', 'labour', 'love', ""'ve"", 'even', 'included', 'same', 'musical', 'themes.Now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'thrill', 'characters', 'coming', 'life', 'can', 'move', 'plot', 'Oh', 'dear', 'Erm', 'well', 'three', 'silver-haired', 'punks', 'turn', 'up', 'claiming', 'want', 'reunite', 'Mother', 'take', 'revenge', 'planet', 'do', 'need', 'find', 'left-over', 'cells', 'original', 'Jenova', 'project', 'was', 'trouble', 'game', 'Can', 'heroes', 'stop', 'Well', 'yes', 'course', 'answer', 'do', 'so', 'film', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'action', 'sequences', 'never', 'breath', '90', 'minutes', 'Now', 'might', 'sound', 'great', 'character', 'plot', 'development', 'action', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'depth', 'vintage', 'side', 'scrolling', 'beat', 'em', 'up', 'film', 'fight', 'fight', 'fight', 'fight', 'silver', 'haired', 'baddies', 'come', 'town', 'heroes', 'fight', 'really', 'Oh', 'also', 'summon', 'big', 'bug-like', 'monsters', 'just', 'one', 'type', 'how', 'cheap', 'wanted', 'see', 'classic', 'FF', 'creatures', 'especially', 'few', 'summons', 'Ifrit', 'Shiva', 'generic', 'beasts', 'are', 'nothing', 'recognised', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'much', 'Anyway', 'Cloud', 'gang', 'rip', 'everything', 'anyway', 'just', 'pausing', 'momentarily', 'utter', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'platitudes', 'life', 'destiny', 'friendship', 'get', 'back', 'leaping', 'motorbikes', 'dashing', 'vertically', 'outside', 'tall', 'buildings', 'do', 'have', 'go', 'baddies', 'action', 'so', 'outrageously', 'top', 'few', 'places', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'laughing', 'think', 'reaction', 'would', 'not', 'upset', 'makers', 'not', 'called', 'fantasy', 'nothing', 'one', 'standout', 'sequence', 'battle', 'particularly', 'large', 'flying', 'dragon', 'type', 'thing', 'only', 'different', 'monster', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'bug', 'things', 'quite', 'breathtaking', 'shots', 'only', 'could', 'really', 'jump', 'upwards', 'enough', 'momentum', 'go', 'high', 'rest', 'film', 'badly', 'time', 'out', 'excitement', 'make', 'care', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'film', 'SO', 'unavoidably', 'fans', 'only', 'impossible', 'anyone', 'new', 'story', 'get', 'anything', 'even', 'someone', 'who', 'original', 'do', 'needs', 'bit', 'more', 'meat', 'story', 'played', 'twice', 'still', 'get', 'lost', 'when', 'try', 'unravel', 'plot', 'movie', 'just', 'over', 'everything', 'when', 'are', 'referencing', 'game', 'had', '100', 'hours', 'interactive', 'detail', 'lot', 'glossing', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'walk', 'get', 'hugely', 'important', 'plot', 'details', 'Mako', 'Materia', 'Jenova', 'Lifestream', 'Soldier', 'Sephiroth', 'Aeris', 'are', 'not', 'explained', 'detail', 'film', 'fans', 'dream', 'developed', 'one', 'favourite', 'characters', 'one', 'very', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'fight', 'beginning', 'end', 'same', 'place', 'same', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'also', 'seemingly', 'shot', 'palette', 'mostly', 'grey', 'black', 'silver', ""n't"", 'lend', 'much', 'variety', 'either', 'Quite', 'exhausting', 'ultimately', 'very', 'throwaway']",N/A
928749,A398SM0LR6KLZO,B000AMJG4Y,Aion,"[2, 2]","Note: This review is only for Last Order, the 20 minute extra that comes on the second DVD of the limited edition. The score is not far the average main feature, Advent Children.-------------------The first thing that needs to be said is that Last Order, a mere extra created to sell more copies of the limited edition release of Advent Children, is actually vastly superior to what it was designed to help sell. It doesn't say a lot good about Advent Children when it isn't even good enough to better an extra, but Last Order did do what Square Enix wanted and helped sell lots of copies of the limited edition release.Last Order was one of the very first things I watched on my then brand new 19"" monitor, and it was a wonderful experience. Up until that point I'd only had a 17"" CRT monitor; one that had such bad brightness levels that it was near impossible to see what was going when watching anything remotely dark. The difference between the two monitors was staggering. But what impressed me more than my new monitor was this surprisingly high quality extra that I had discovered at complete random. The art, animation, pacing, music...everything about it impressed me. Watching it made me want to own it, even if it meant paying a daft amount just for 20 minutes due to it only being available with Advent Children.The story is short and sweet since it wasn't possible for Madhouse to fit too much story into 20 minutes and make it flashy and fast-paced enough to do what Square wanted.Sephiroth, the best member of SOLDIER (the elite of Shinra) has gone insane, killing nearly everyone in the village he was staying in to complete a mission. This leaves Zack, another SOLDIER member who had gone with Sephiroth to learn from the best and help complete the mission, with the unenviable job of attempting to stop Sephiroth before his insanity causes even more deaths.Unlike Advent Children, which did an awful job of continuing the story of the most famous game (FFVII) Square have created, Last Order briefly covers the best part of the games story - the Nibelheim disaster. In the game the true story of what happened wasn't revealed in full until near the end, with a flashback near the start having mixed up the events prior to the big reveal. Last Order, however, gets right into what really happened, telling the story from the perspective of Zack; a character key to the main character of the game, and a character who barely featured in the game. The story in Last Order skips the build-up to what led to Nibelheim turning into an inferno because of time constraints, the focus instead being on what happened right after it started at the nearby Mako Reactor. The story also constantly switches from the Nibelheim events to what's happening in the present (of the Last Order story), showing Zack trying to flee from a small army of Shinra troops and the infamous Turks; the Shinra department that deals with the more dirty side of their business.Aside from selling more copies of the Advent Children limited edition, the other objective was clearly to flesh out the character of Zack in preparation for his lead role in Crisis Core (the prequel to FFVII), and that was accomplished excellently by adding filler that showed him to be the sort of guy who'd laugh in the face of death and protect a friend no matter what. The game did give you an idea what type of guy Zack was by including an optional truck scene (FFVII players will understand what I'm referring to) that briefly showed Zack chatting away about the future shortly before the fitting and tragic end to his story, but watching the same scene in animated form, after having seen lots of filler flesh out his character, made it much more powerful.Moving onto the fluff side, the OVA was as high budget as you'd expect an animation that only lasts 20 minutes to have been. The art is excellent throughout, the dark/gloomy colours set the mood perfectly, the animation flows without issue and the music is brilliant. Watching this really made me wish that Madhouse had been allowed to create an OVA with more than one episode - it would've been brilliant to see Madhouse cover more of the Nibelheim story.Speaking of looks, the main attraction for FFVII fans is the Zack vs. Sephiroth fight and Madhouse didn't disappoint in creating an exciting fight with very little source material to work with. The fight, which lasted under a minute, put the sleep inducing sword contests in Advent Children to shame. It was paced perfectly, with no needless sword waving/building throwing occurring, and it even had a nice little extra on show for fans of the game - a low level limit break that any fan of the game would recognise. And it's also worth mentioning the music that plays during the fight and the end credits - the music, combined with the animation, made my cheeks tingle when I first watched the fight sequence.All in all, Last Order is a very satisfying and highly enjoyable piece of animation for any fan of the game, or even anyone simply interested in seeing the best part of the game story without going through the game. If you want to watch something FFVII related, make sure it's this and not the flashy yet empty main feature.Rating: 9/10",5,Last Order,1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,5228,"['Note', 'review', 'only',

928750,A2ZS8TWUL1QTRH,B000AMJG4Y,A.J. Dill,"[26, 80]","I can't believe all of these rave reviews of this movie. To me, I think it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I myself have played the Final Fantasy 7 game to death and know who everyone is already. I am a big fan of the game since it has a decent story, but FF7 Advent Children fell way short for me.The major problem with the movie is it is predictable beyond all reason. The plot was basically a repeat of a dummied down version of the game. The only major difference is there is a virus Geostigma killing those who have Jenova's cells within them, Cloud has a couple of kids, and there isn't a gigantic meteor coming to destroy the world. There were no twists, the plot was extrememly linear and unoriginal. How many movies have the bad guys taking advantage of little children? How many movies have copied fight scenes from The Matrix? How many movies have a bad guy who's sanity is questionable? The answer to that is TOO MANY.I found it sad about how the movie handled all of the heros. You find out nothing about what happened during the past two years of their life. I guess nothind did since they just popped into the movie to save the day when the big bad monster appeared. I also found it strange how Cloud was still moping over the death of Aerith, and didn't want to fight. The movie gave no explanation why he became such a sissy in the past two years in the first place- no tramatic events, nothing.If you want the plot here it is- three guys like Sephiroth search for Jenova. They attack the heros. The badies steal several children. Another fight like The Matrix. The bad guys summon a big bad monster which the good guys beat. Then the badies find Jenova's head. Sephiroth comes back to destroy the world and gets beaten by Cloud again. All the people are cured from their virus by magical water and happily ever after.The only reason to watch this movie is to say that you have. The 3D graphics are good. Some of the visuals were stunning, but then again there was nothing original.

928754,AE8LL9S715YTE,B000AMJG4Y,"Amazon Customer ""fbrobertson2""","[11, 14]","I watched the movie today.  And I felt really cheated having waited for something like this after so long, but getting so little.  The movie itself, CGI, was attractively done.  Almost like watching a real movie.  Almost like watching real people acting and reacting to surroundings.  It would be interesting to see if the PS3 brings back FFVII and use these sorts of graphics.  In fact I hope that they do.  And yes, before you attack, thinking I know nothing about the original game, I am a big fan of VII, I still have it and still play it when the desire strikes.  And yet behind all this beautiful artwork, I felt like I was wanting more.  This wanting more comes in three bullets.One.  The villains were only ""eh,"" in the sense that they did not have the all important background given that would have made them more dangerous, more intriguing, more hateful by we the movie audience.  The villains were nothing more than three Sephiroths with different hairstyle per character.  Yes they were exciting in the battles, but CGI can only go so far, if there isn't a cemented background, I can only shrug and say ""ok...what else?""  I would have loved to have had the movie get more involved into what was going on in the villain's mind beside wanting them to go find their ""mom.""  I did not care for how the villains affected the main characters.  I wanted to, but couldn't.Two.  We only get to see a little bit of the other characters I myself grew to love in the original video game.  I'd love to have seen the others moving about, acting and interacting, but we dont see this.  We only get them ""somewhat"" in the final portions of the end battle.  The video game was not only about Cloud, though he was the main character.  What about Yuffie? Barret?  The others?  What all has happened to them after the ending of the original game?  How did they grow between the original game and the Advent Children movie?  What sort of demons did they go through due to what was happening to the children?Three.  The epic feeling was gone, though the children had been stained, you didn't really get involved in what they were going through, what they were feeling, they were just there to move the story along, not real people having real damage.  The original game was epic, you didn't just go around one city or some ruins, you went throughout the entire world intimately, powerfully, and there was an epic feeling to how each place was a portion of the greater story.  This was not there in the movie.  I got the feeling that the background was just that, background for another battle.  The background could have been a Chocobo farm for all the lack of importance.Sadly, what I suggest is this.  Rent the movie.  That's it.  It isn't worth the money unless you truly wish to have it, I have it, but, I dont know if I will see it again anytime soon...CGI can only go so far, I want substance and I want story and I want these indepth and intricate and passionate, just like the original game.",3,"I realize I will be burned at the stakes, but...",1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,2989,"['watched', 'movie', 'today', 'felt', 'really', 'cheated', 'having', 'waited', 'something', 'so', 'long', 'getting', 'so', 'little', 'movie', 'CGI', 'was', 'attractively', 'done', 'Almost', 'watching', 'real', 'movie', 'watching', 'real', 'people', 'acting', 'reacting', 'surroundings', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'PS3', 'back', 'FFVII', 'use', 'sorts', 'graphics', 'fact', 'hope', 'do', 'yes', 'attack', 'thinking', 'know', 'nothing', 'original', 'game', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'VII', 'still', 'have', 'still', 'play', 'when', 'desire', 'strikes', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'artwork', 'felt', 'was', 'wanting', 'more', 'wanting', 'more', 'three', 'bullets.One', 'villains', 'were', 'only', 'eh', 'sense', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'important', 'background', 'given', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'dangerous', 'more', 'intriguing', 'more', 'hateful', 'movie', 'audience', 'villains', 'were', 'nothing', 'more', 'three', 'Sephiroths', 'different', 'hairstyle', 'character', 'Yes', 'were', 'exciting', 'battles', 'CGI', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'so', 'far', ""n't"", 'cemented', 'background', 'can', 'only', 'shrug', 'say', 'ok', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'had', 'movie', 'get', 'more', 'involved', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'villain', 'mind', 'beside', 'wanting', 'go', 'find', 'mom', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'how', 'villains', 'affected', 'main', 'characters', 'wanted', ""couldn't.Two"", 'only', 'get', 'see', 'little', 'bit', 'other', 'characters', 'grew', 'love', 'original', 'video', 'game', ""'d"", 'love', 'have', 'seen', 'others', 'moving', 'about', 'acting', 'interacting', 'dont', 'see', 'only', 'get', 'somewhat', 'final', 'portions', 'end', 'battle', 'video', 'game', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'Cloud', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'What', 'Yuffie', 'Barret', 'others', 'What', 'happened', 'ending', 'original', 'game', 'How', 'did', 'grow', 'original', 'game', 'Advent', 'Children', 'movie', 'What', 'sort', 'demons', 'did', 'go', 'due', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'children', 'Three', 'epic', 'feeling', 'was', 'gone', 'children', 'had', 'been', 'stained', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'involved', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'what', 'were', 'feeling', 'were', 'just', 'there', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'not', 'real', 'people', 'having', 'real', 'damage', 'original', 'game', 'was', 'epic', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'around', 'one', 'city', 'ruins', 'went', 'entire', 'world', 'intimately', 'powerfully', 'was', 'epic', 'feeling', 'how', 'place', 'was', 'portion', 'greater', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'there', 'movie', 'got', 'feeling', 'background', 'was', 'just', 'background', 'battle', 'background', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Chocobo', 'farm', 'lack', 'importance.Sadly', 'what', 'suggest', 'Rent', 'movie', ""n't"", 'worth', 'money', 'truly', 'wish', 'have', 'have', 'dont', 'know', 'will', 'see', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon', 'CGI', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'want', 'substance', 'want', 'story', 'want', 'indepth', 'intricate', 'passionate', 'just', 'original', 'game']",N/A

928761,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000AMJG4Y,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[2, 5]","Ever since I heard of this movie three years ago, I was shaking in anticipation of it. How could I not be? I still consider Final Fantasy VII the best game ever, with one of the most in-depth and emotional stories written. And the characters were easily the most lovable of any of the FF games (come on, who didn't cry when Aerith died). Needless to say, upon finishing the game, I wanted more.Almost nine years later, I'm finally getting what I wanted (me and millions more). Advent Children takes place only two short years after the climax of Final Fantasy VII, and the children of Midgar are suffering from a disease associated with the Reunion. They call it Geostigma, and it causes pain to everyone who has it. Including our hero, Cloud, who continues to fight for these children despite the pain. But when a group of ""spirits"" appear, who claim to be three more of JENOVA's offspring, Cloud's fight becomes a little more desperate. What follows is perhaps an hours worth of action interlaced here and there with some emotional character interaction.The action in the movie is excellent. But two scenes in particular stick out in my mind, and that's the battle with Bahamut, where Cloud and all his friends are reunited, and the final battle with Kadaj. I think I like the Bahamut fight because of what happens during the battle. It's instant nostalgia for FFVII fans, and you can't help but smile as the characters pull off some rather super human feats. And as for the Kadaj fight, I'll leave that one unexplained...Another great part about this movie is the surprise appearance by characters thought lost. I won't spoil it here, but at least two characters appear, and have important roles, in this movie when they were thought dead in FFVII (and Aerith isn't one of them).All together, this movie is the best I've seen when it comes to animated features. The only one that even comes close is The Incredibles, and the action in that film is dull compared to what's found in Advent Children. It's far better than Final Fantasy: A Spirit's Within, and I'm kind of wondering why that movie was ever made when this one had been planned. But I think, after watching, I can guess: this movie is for Final Fantasy VII fans only. The story in this is never explained, very specific words are used (like SOLDIER and Reunion) that no one besides players of the game will know. It's kind of a movie geared toward the Final Fantasy VII fan club. But still, if you have even a small amount of familiarity with Final Fantasy, get this whenever if comes out. Even if you don't quite know what's going on, the visuals easily carry this technological masterpiece of an animation.",5,The Final Fantasy Club,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,2672,"['Ever', 'heard', 'movie', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'shaking', 'anticipation', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'still', 'consider', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'best', 'game', 'ever', 'one', 'most', 'in-depth', 'emotional', 'stories', 'written', 'characters', 'were', 'easily', 'most', 'lovable', 'FF', 'games', 'come', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'cry', 'when', 'Aerith', 'died', 'Needless', 'say', 'finishing', 'game', 'wanted', 'more.Almost', 'nine', 'years', 'later', ""'m"", 'finally', 'getting', 'what', 'wanted', 'millions', 'more', 'Advent', 'Children', 'place', 'only', 'two', 'short', 'years', 'climax', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'children', 'Midgar', 'are', 'suffering', 'disease', 'associated', 'Reunion', 'call', 'Geostigma', 'pain', 'everyone', 'who', 'Including', 'hero', 'Cloud', 'who', 'fight', 'children', 'pain', 'when', 'group', 'spirits', 'appear', 'who', 'claim', 'be', 'three', 'more', 'JENOVA', 'offspring', 'Cloud', 'fight', 'little', 'more', 'desperate', 'What', 'perhaps', 'hours', 'worth', 'action', 'interlaced', 'here', 'there', 'emotional', 'character', 'interaction.The', 'action', 'movie', 'excellent', 'two', 'scenes', 'particular', 'stick', 'out', 'mind', 'battle', 'Bahamut', 'where', 'Cloud', 'friends', 'are', 'reunited', 'final', 'battle', 'Kadaj', 'think', 'Bahamut', 'fight', 'what', 'battle', 'instant', 'nostalgia', 'FFVII', 'fans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'characters', 'pull', 'off', 'rather', 'super', 'human', 'feats', 'Kadaj', 'fight', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'one', 'unexplained', 'great', 'part', 'movie', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'characters', 'thought', 'lost', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here', 'least', 'two', 'characters', 'appear', 'have', 'important', 'roles', 'movie', 'when', 'were', 'thought', 'dead', 'FFVII', 'Aerith', ""n't"", 'one', 'together', 'movie', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'when', 'animated', 'features', 'only', 'one', 'even', 'close', 'Incredibles', 'action', 'film', 'dull', 'compared', 'what', 'found', 'Advent', 'Children', 'far', 'better', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirit', 'Within', ""'m"", 'kind', 'wondering', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'ever', 'made', 'when', 'one', 'had', 'been', 'planned', 'think', 'watching', 'can', 'guess', 'movie', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'only', 'story', 'never', 'explained', 'very', 'specific', 'words', 'are', 'used', 'SOLDIER', 'Reunion', 'one', 'players', 'game', 'will', 'know', 'kind', 'movie', 'geared', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'fan', 'club', 'still', 'have', 'even', 'small', 'amount', 'familiarity', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'get', 'whenever', 'out', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'visuals', 'easily', 'carry', 'technological', 'masterpiece', 'animation']",N/A
928762,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B000AMJG4Y,A. Schneider,"[11, 12]","The following review is for the subtitled version of the film (which as of when this review was written, is the only version of the film out). I have to say, the art was breath taking... the story was a bit confusing, but even for a general final fantasy fan with no experience in playing FF7, this movie is absolutely amazing... if that's you and you're a reasonably intelligent open minded person then this review is for you.I realize that many people would like a movie which is clear from beginning to end. You weren't going to get that with this - the movie is target only to individuals through gaming circles, likewise the true target audience was people who have already played the FF7 game (whereas Spirits Within for instance was for just about anyone and was marketed as a major motion picture).Keeping that in mind there's no reason to complain about the lack of explanation in the movie. Certainly one could wish there was more but it isn't necessary, take the film for what it is and if you still don't like it then write a descriptive review of what exactly you didn't like. I've seen a number of quality independent films and films that were marketed in a similar way and so I didn't mind the lack of clarity. There's only so much you could explain in a movie about characters with such a heavy back story while still remaining in the realm of entertaining.The bulk of the story is complicated to follow as past reviewers have noted because the movie works on an emotional level to flesh out Cloud's character and bring to light things that were still haunting him from the time of the game *and* prior to that (the game's back story, if you will). Many things are not clearly stated in the movie such as the past relationship between Sephiroth and Cloud and how Sephiroth often uses Cloud's tormenting memories as a way to weaken him (this for instance is illustrated in one of the last segments in the movie where Sephiroth says, ""I will not remain just a memory"" - threatening Cloud, reminding him that he has the Jenova Cells in him as well). On an emotional level without ever playing the game the plot itself is a 4/5 depending on whether or not you can supplement what you've watched with outside reference material.How do you figure out the back story once you've seen the movie or prior to seeing the movie? Online encyclopedias if you haven't played Final Fantasy 7. Tedious? Not at all, the movie makes such research worthwhile for people who haven't played the game but are interested in fleshing out their knowledge of the events and relationships that made themselves apparent in the film. Why would you watch a movie that you'll have to look up information for later? Because the characters are so lovable they are worth it - they'll make you want to play the game if you haven't, and the emotional ties solidified in this movie - I assure you - will strengthen as you see Cloud and his friends suffer in the game (as cruel as that sounds).Familiar with digital animation, I should point out once more than this film doesn't just have spectacular graphics it *has* cutting edge graphics which should be praised and awarded. The movie simply isn't that much money for what it is, and for what it is it can easily become one of the best anime's you've seen to date (especially if you supplement your viewing experience with some background information if you don't have it already, and if you do then keep an open mind about the film).And the music? Forget about it... perfect! Hard rock/industrial sort mixed with some Final Fantasy-favorite tunes, and some other lovely songs. Great with the fast paced action (negative reviews about action being too fast paced? Grow up, unless of course you think it interferes with the cohesiveness of the film).I can only hope that you - the reader - can enjoy and appreciate this film as much as I have. I realize that many people have negative views about films based on the fact that it has been hyped up in gaming circles and that they've been anticipating it for a while (this happens whenever you mix diehard fans with a new movie featuring the characters they love in it), but keep an open mind and you'll love it.",5,A Hitchhiker's Guide to Advent Children,1127865600,"09 28, 2005",2005,4189,"['following', 'review', 'subtitled', 'version', 'film', 'when', 'review', 'was', 'written', 'only', 'version', 'film', 'out', 'have', 'say', 'art', 'was', 'breath', 'taking', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'confusing', 'even', 'general', 'final', 'fantasy', 'fan', 'experience', 'playing', 'FF7', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'amazing', ""'re"", 'reasonably', 'intelligent', 'open', 'minded', 'person', 'then', 'review', 'you.I', 'realize', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'clear', 'beginning', 'end', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'movie', 'target', 'only', 'individuals', 'gaming', 'circles', 'likewise', 'true', 'target', 'audience', 'was', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'played', 'FF7', 'game', 'whereas', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'instance', 'was', 'just', 'anyone', 'was', 'marketed', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', '.Keeping', 'mind', 'reason', 'complain', 'lack', 'explanation', 'movie', 'Certainly', 'one', 'could', 'wish', 'was', 'more', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'take', 'film', 'what', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'then', 'write', 'descriptive', 'review', 'what', 'exactly', 'did', ""n't"", ""'ve"", 'seen', 'number', 'quality', 'independent', 'films', 'films', 'were', 'marketed', 'similar', 'way', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'lack', 'clarity', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'explain', 'movie', 'characters', 'heavy', 'back', 'story', 'still', 'remaining', 'realm', 'entertaining.The', 'bulk', 'story', 'complicated', 'follow', 'past', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'movie', 'emotional', 'level', 'flesh', 'out', 'Cloud', 'character', 'bring', 'light', 'things', 'were', 'still', 'haunting', 'time', 'game', '*and*', 'prior', 'game', 'back', 'story', 'will', 'Many', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'clearly', 'stated', 'movie', 'such', 'past', 'relationship', 'Sephiroth', 'Cloud', 'how', 'Sephiroth', 'often', 'Cloud', 'tormenting', 'memories', 'way', 'weaken', 'instance', 'illustrated', 'one', 'last', 'segments', 'movie', 'where', 'Sephiroth', 'will', 'not', 'remain', 'just', 'memory', 'threatening', 'Cloud', 'reminding', 'Jenova', 'Cells', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'level', 'ever', 'playing', 'game', 'plot', '4/5', 'depending', 'not', 'can', 'supplement', 'what', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'outside', 'reference', 'material.How', 'do', 'figure', 'out', 'back', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'prior', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Online', 'encyclopedias', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'Final', 'Fantasy', '7', 'Tedious', 'Not', 'movie', 'such', 'research', 'worthwhile', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'game', 'are', 'interested', 'fleshing', 'out', 'knowledge', 'events', 'relationships', 'made', 'apparent', 'film', 'Why', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'have', 'look', 'up', 'information', 'later', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'lovable', 'are', ""'ll"", 'make', 'want', 'play', 'game', 'have', ""n't"", 'emotional', 'ties', 'solidified', 'movie', 'assure', 'will', 'strengthen', 'see', 'Cloud', 'friends', 'suffer', 'game', 'as', 'cruel', '.Familiar', 'digital', 'animation', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'once', 'more', 'film', ""n't"", 'just', 'have', 'spectacular', 'graphics', '*has*', 'cutting', 'edge', 'graphics', 'should', 'be', 'praised', 'awarded', 'movie', 'simply', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'money', 'what', 'what', 'can', 'easily', 'become', 'one', 'best', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'date', 'especially', 'supplement', 'viewing', 'experience', 'background', 'information', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'already', 'do', 'then', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'film', 'music', 'Forget', 'perfect', 'Hard', 'rock/industrial', 'sort', 'mixed', 'Final', 'Fantasy-favorite', 'tunes', 'other', 'lovely', 'songs', 'Great', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'negative', 'reviews', 'action', 'being', 'too', 'fast', 'paced', 'Grow', 'up', 'course', 'think', 'cohesiveness', 'film', '.I', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'reader', 'can', 'enjoy', 'appreciate', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'realize', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'negative', 'views', 'films', 'based', 'fact', 'been', 'hyped', 'up', 'gaming', 'circles', ""'ve"", 'been', 'anticipating', 'while', 'whenever', 'mix', 'diehard', 'fans', 'new', 'movie', 'featuring', 'characters', 'love', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'love']",N/A

It takes place two years after the events of the game and set in a new city called Edge. Two years since Cloud Strife defeated Sephiroth, who summoned a meteor that attempted to devastate the planet, but only destroyed the city of Midgar. It focuses on Cloud who is a delivery boy now living alongside Tifa Lockhart and taking care of two kids. Cloud is summoned to find the cause of ""Geostigma"", a disease that's dangerous to the city's population. At first, he refuses. Yet, eventually comes around.  A trio of brothers arrives with what appears to be a cure for the stigma, but they conceal a more sinister plot. That plot is to revive Sephiroth and bring about the end of the world. Before long, Cloud picks up arms(or should I say, sword) and heads into battle to stop the brothers. That's how it all starts to come to a frenetic finish.Do you have to have played and know the game on which it's based in order to understand what's going on in the movie, as mentioned in the editorial review? The answer ot that is,at least in my humble opinion, yes and no. Course, not dissing FF7(mind you), its' story is pretty out there...if you've played, practically, every game in the series. Wait, scratch that....it's story is(ahem) complex. Lol. At any rate, like the editorial review said, it does help(although you really don't need it). Those who hadn't played the game probably won't show much interest in the movie but they'd be missing a good...nay, great Sci-fi movie.What do I think of the movie?  It's absolutely stunning. Way better than Final Fantasy:The Spirits Within, for sure. The action will, definitely, keep you on the edge of your seat.It worth adding to your collection whether you're a gamer or a Sci-fi fan. I highly recommend it.However, I don't understand why Square didn't decide to make this story into a game. Fans have been clamoring for more Cloud since they finished FF7 years ago. That's pretty evident considering how they've been pushing Square to 'remake' FF7 on our current console systems. I imagine there's alot of people saying the same thing I am. Yet, I'm satisfied with what we've received from Square.Gripe? Not a one. If you read most of my reviews, you know that hardly ever happens. I usually got one gripe.

(and the ""this movie has been modified to fit this screen"" warning lets you know that this was not the intention in the 1st place)I really liked this movie, even with it's drawbacks:-No chapter selection menu-No extra features whatsoever-And the extremely low volume it plays in (you have to set the volume to max and set the UMD audio option to ""+2"", and use headphones to hear what they're saying).All of these due to the UMD format, so I considered getting the DVD version after it's release and I ended up buying the Blu-Ray of the Complete Edition.Even with all the extra scenes included I still watch my UMD and I still prefer the final battle of the Original version rather than the one in Complete.---------------------------------------------------------EDITAnd since apparently I can't make a Review for the Complete Edition Blu-Ray, I will post it here and add a title for each one inside the review itself---------------------------------------------------------FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN Complete Edition - BLU-RAY - 4.5 StarsExcellent quality, excellent film, love all the scenes included, why only 4 stars? the final battle.This complete Edition has a lot of extended scenes included in it, and every single one of them is adding to the perfection of the film (the highway chase near the end, kicks the crap out of the whole ""Normal"" film by itself), and they are masterly incorporated into the film (I mean the syncing with the original music and story play, it's very well done) that none of my friends believed me when I tried to convince them that this was an extended version of the one we saw (the one I also have in UMD format).Along with extended scenes, are some few minor changes in some other ones, like the one of the Battle between Sephiroth and Cloud. It has a lot of extended scenes this battle, but the minor difference is the final blow that Cloud inflicts Sephiroth, it's almost the same but slightly different, and waaaayyyyy better in the original one.They take out the scene in which Cloud disassembles that sword, I take down half a star.",5,Advent Children For PSP,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,2344,"['FINAL', 'FANTASY', 'VII', 'ADVENT', 'CHILDREN', 'UMD', 'PSP', '5', 'StarsI', 'still', 'better', 'Complete', 'Edition.When', 'got', 'UMD', 'was', 'rumored', 'now', 'proven', 'false', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'exclusively', 'PSP', 'wrong', 'are', 'now', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'editions', 'movie', 'been', 'modified', 'fit', 'screen', 'warning', 'lets', 'know', 'was', 'not', 'intention', '1st', 'place', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'even', 'drawbacks', '-No', 'chapter', 'selection', 'menu-No', 'extra', 'features', 'whatsoever-And', 'extremely', 'low', 'volume', 'have', 'set', 'volume', 'max', 'set', 'UMD', 'audio', 'option', '+2', 'use', 'headphones', 'hear', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying', '.All', 'due', 'UMD', 'format', 'considered', 'getting', 'DVD', 'version', 'release', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'Blu-Ray', 'Complete', 'Edition.Even', 'extra', 'scenes', 'included', 'still', 'watch', 'UMD', 'still', 'prefer', 'final', 'battle', 'Original', 'version', 'rather', 'one', 'Complete.', '-EDITAnd', 'apparently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'Review', 'Complete', 'Edition', 'Blu-Ray', 'will', 'post', 'here', 'add', 'title', 'one', 'review', '-FINAL', 'FANTASY', 'VII', 'ADVENT', 'CHILDREN', 'Complete', 'Edition', 'BLU-RAY', '4.5', 'StarsExcellent', 'quality', 'excellent', 'film', 'love', 'scenes', 'included', 'why', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'final', 'battle.This', 'complete', 'Edition', 'lot', 'extended', 'scenes', 'included', 'single', 'one', 'adding', 'perfection', 'film', 'highway', 'chase', 'end', 'crap', 'whole', 'Normal', 'film', 'are', 'masterly', 'incorporated', 'film', 'mean', 'syncing', 'original', 'music', 'story', 'play', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'none', 'friends', 'believed', 'when', 'tried', 'convince', 'was', 'extended', 'version', 'one', 'saw', 'one', 'also', 'have', 'UMD', 'format', '.Along', 'extended', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'minor', 'changes', 'other', 'ones', 'one', 'Battle', 'Sephiroth', 'Cloud', 'lot', 'extended', 'scenes', 'battle', 'minor', 'difference', 'final', 'blow', 'Cloud', 'Sephiroth', 'almost', 'same', 'slightly', 'different', 'waaaayyyyy', 'better', 'original', 'one.They', 'take', 'out', 'scene', 'Cloud', 'sword', 'take', 'down', 'star']",N/A

Oh what a joy!Seeing every character give Cloud a 'boost' during the bahamut battle was awesome. And that finishing move vs Sephiroth will put a smile on your face.

The animation is so good, you sometimes get lost in its quality, forgetting you're watching a simulated camera sweep through DRAWINGS. I could talk all day about the animation. It's tremendous! Even flawless.My problem with the movie comes from the most basic of movie criticisms. The emotions and characters are hollow and empty. Yeah, we're watching motorcycle riders attack the hero CLOUD, but WHO CARES? Why? Why do we care? There is absolutely ZERO EMOTIONAL BUILD UP.We watch these TREMENDOUSLY COOL scenes. Battles. Magic. But there is no emotional involvement achieved. The main character CLOUD speaks in his same, downbeat depressed tone throughout. Never once giving us any emotion other than... like a young KEANU REEVES on downers.I couldn't help watching the film and thinking that this was an animation tutorial. This is what can be done with the future of animation. Yet, the creators weren't too concerned with story arc, emotional involvement or achieving any other emotion than... ""that was cool.""Despite all the tremendously cool scenes, clanging metal, roaring motorcycles and magic waves of blue, FINAL FANTASY 7 falls flat with boring characters. They spent no time focusing on achieving an emotional contact with their audience and it shows.FINAL FANTASY VII isn't without merit. The animation is worth seeing.

FF7... FF9... FF10... FF12... (FF8... not so much. FF11... never played)For gamers like me, RPG freaks born in the 1970's, the ""Final Fantasy"" series of games is, in many ways, the pinacle of what video game RPGs should be. Epic, beautiful, clever, touching, etc.The previous CGI FF film,Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within (Special Edition), did not live up to the fine tradition of the video games. The plot was, let's face it, bizzare at best (I so hate Gaia theory... it makes no sense! Earth as a living organism my left eye!). The voice-over work was unexceptional. The animation was great, but that was about it.Now, however, we have ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"". And it is good. Not great. Not likeM - 2 Disc Special Edition (Criterion Collection Spine #30),The Grapes of Wrath,Sunrise - A Song of Two HumansorCitizen Kane, but it is good.The plot basically centers around a Sephiroth cosplaying freak (translation for non-otaku: femmy-looking bad-guy impersonating another femmy-looking bad-guy), who is trying to revive a Great Power of Evil (tm), in order to... to... you know, I'm still not entirely sure. Destroy the world? Have a mom? Something like that.Really the plot doesn't matter. This is a movie about incredible sights, amazing sounds, stunning action sequences and a really, really hot main character (O, Cloud! My Cloud!). The CGI is really breath-taking. The characters are as close to photo-realistic as anything I've ever seen.The fight sequences are just as impressive, if somewhat physics-violating (how is someone who is airborne supposed to boost someone else who is airborne? Still, this isn't as bad asSuperman Returns (Two Disc Special Edition)where Superman lifted something he was standing on at the time he was lifting it). Basically the fights are very much what you might expect of a CGI anime.And the music! Oh, goodness, the music! Nobuo Uematsu is an extremely skilled composer and this film really highlights that. ""Cloud's Theme"" and ""One-Winged Angel"" are the best tracks, but the rest is spectacular, too! Heck, there's one part where any FF fan will laugh as the ""Victory Music"" plays! Just buyingFinal Fantasy VII: Advent Children(the soundtack), alone would be worth it.This movie really is complete fan-service. There's nothing wrong with that, but if you haven't played the game, expect to be very, very lost. Still, long as you're lost you might as well enjoy the brilliant sights and sounds.The film gets four stars. 2 if you haven't played the game and 5 if you have.

928781,A2SL4FKEMIZSYD,B000AMJG4Y,"Chris Teague ""Chris""","[2, 3]","I'll just get this out of the way with a wink and a smile: Final Fantasy VII is overrated. I'm sure when it came out, people saw it as an innovation in storytelling and the use of 3D in RPGs. But if you've been playing games since then and have just now picked it up, only to arrive at the conclusion that FFVII is STILL the best game ever made....you're just jumping on the bandwagon. I've beaten the game, and that's my opinion.Anywho, super cool movie. The plot is not that difficult to follow, but if you've ever seen The Spirits Within, you'll most likely know what it feels like to zone out during a scene. e.g. the drab colors and constant repetitive motion of battles is sometimes just a real eyesore. Don't get me wrong, I got the bubblies when I saw the first motorcycle fight sequence, but the third and the fourth and the fifth(where they end up at the Shinra Building) were just killer on my attention span. On the other hand, some fight scenes gave me the bubblies just like the first. Of course, those were the ones that had actual meaning, as in when the whole cast reunites to gang on a particular baddie.Speaking of meaning: the plot. The plot was pretty good. I think I really enjoyed sitting through this movie more than sitting through that game. So at this point, I have nothing against either. (SPOILER) The parts where the children are being abducted and drinking the Jenova stuff, then they stand in a circle around the statue in Midgar....what was the point of that? Nothing happened to them at all, and they certainly weren't some sort of threat to the cast. There was no conflict! No conflict in that, I tell you! (END SPOILER) It was basically as dry as Spirits Within, but I suspect it was really the characters who drew me in more than the plot.Ah, the characters. Cloud is antisocial as ever, still feeling embittered by Aeris' death, and even moreso when rumors of Sephiroth's second coming are abound. (See there? THAT makes more sense now.) Aeris, surprisingly enough, is a major character in the movie, since she manifests herself as a physical healing aspect(that I won't spoil). Finally, a few surprise defections and a cast full of our faves from the game later, everything is looking pretty peachy.Finally, the animation. Hooooooly crap, everyone flies! There are some really cool scenes, and I mean some REALLY cool scenes in which this whole ignorance of gravity really makes the action on screen more exciting. On the other hand, in the action sequences that just don't matter, it's still used, which makes it just a little too casual for future scenes. Am I confusing you with this? I guess you'll just have to see.Finally, the end of the movie and the credits were pretty satisfying. Keep watching after the white-on-black credits because there's an easter egg or two you'll enjoy. I plan to buy the North American release, even though I've just seen it in Jap with English subtitles, because I want to hear the voices and see some DVD extras. Also, it's good to support S-E for their work on this project and not just steal it for kicks.",4,"What is this ""gravity"" you speak of?",1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,3083,"[""'ll"", 'just', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'wink', 'smile', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'overrated', ""'m"", 'sure', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'people', 'saw', 'innovation', 'storytelling', 'use', '3D', 'RPGs', ""'ve"", 'been', 'playing', 'games', 'then', 'have', 'just', 'now', 'picked', 'up', 'only', 'arrive', 'conclusion', 'FFVII', 'STILL', 'best', 'game', 'ever', 'made', '.you', ""'re"", 'just', 'jumping', 'bandwagon', ""'ve"", 'beaten', 'game', 'opinion.Anywho', 'super', 'cool', 'movie', 'plot', 'not', 'difficult', 'follow', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Spirits', 'Within', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'know', 'what', 'zone', 'out', 'scene', 'e.g', 'drab', 'colors', 'constant', 'repetitive', 'motion', 'battles', 'sometimes', 'just', 'real', 'eyesore', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'got', 'bubblies', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'motorcycle', 'fight', 'sequence', 'third', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'Shinra', 'Building', 'were', 'just', 'killer', 'attention', 'span', 'other', 'hand', 'fight', 'scenes', 'gave', 'bubblies', 'just', 'first', 'course', 'were', 'ones', 'had', 'actual', 'meaning', 'when', 'whole', 'cast', 'reunites', 'gang', 'particular', 'baddie.Speaking', 'meaning', 'plot', 'plot', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'think', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'sitting', 'movie', 'more', 'sitting', 'game', 'So', 'point', 'have', 'nothing', 'SPOILER', 'parts', 'where', 'children', 'are', 'being', 'abducted', 'drinking', 'Jenova', 'stuff', 'then', 'stand', 'circle', 'statue', 'Midgar', 'was', 'point', 'Nothing', 'happened', 'certainly', 'were', ""n't"", 'sort', 'threat', 'cast', 'was', 'conflict', 'conflict', 'tell', 'END', 'SPOILER', 'was', 'basically', 'as', 'dry', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'suspect', 'was', 'really', 'characters', 'who', 'drew', 'more', 'plot.Ah', 'characters', 'Cloud', 'antisocial', 'ever', 'still', 'feeling', 'embittered', 'Aeris', 'death', 'even', 'moreso', 'when', 'rumors', 'Sephiroth', 'second', 'coming', 'are', 'abound', 'See', 'there', 'THAT', 'more', 'sense', 'now', 'Aeris', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'major', 'character', 'movie', 'physical', 'healing', 'aspect', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'Finally', 'few', 'surprise', 'defections', 'cast', 'full', 'faves', 'game', 'later', 'everything', 'looking', 'pretty', 'peachy.Finally', 'animation', 'Hooooooly', 'crap', 'everyone', 'flies', 'are', 'really', 'cool', 'scenes', 'mean', 'REALLY', 'cool', 'scenes', 'whole', 'ignorance', 'gravity', 'really', 'action', 'screen', 'more', 'exciting', 'other', 'hand', 'action', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'still', 'used', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'casual', 'future', 'scenes', 'Am', 'confusing', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see.Finally', 'end', 'movie', 'credits', 'were', 'pretty', 'satisfying', 'Keep', 'watching', 'white-on-black', 'credits', 'easter', 'egg', 'two', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'plan', 'buy', 'North', 'American', 'release', 'even', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'Jap', 'English', 'subtitles', 'want', 'hear', 'voices', 'see', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Also', 'good', 'support', 'S-E', 'work', 'project', 'not', 'just', 'steal', 'kicks']",N/A

There was so much hype over this movie and on top of that there was the fact it was based on mine (and others) favorite Final Fantasy game. To me they rushed the story in places they should have taken more time in expanding the plot. Then drew out other parts that just didnt need to be there. The characterzation of new faces (which was glamorized in so many reviews I read) really wasnt there I didnt feel for the band of three mysterious travelers nor did I get the same excitement of watching Cloud break through others expectations. It seemed to me this movie was half of what it could have been if the writers didnt spend 45minutes of the movie just to get the plot to allow seporoth into it somehow. As much as I was glad to see him return it wasnt worth the sacrifice of allowing this movie to be all right instead of what it could have been -Excellent--For Everyone that keeps going on about the graphics I give you a big laugh in your face. every true fan knows the reason the game was great had nothing to do with the graphics and everything to do with the characters.

928785,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000AMJG4Y,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","Only thing is it isn't an adaptation. The game Final Fantasy VII was released in 1997 and it had quite an ambigious ending. After the sequel to Final Fantasy X came out, the first sequel for the series ever, Squaresoft(later renamed Square-Enix) expanded on VII's storyline and now there's a PS2 game, a PSP game, a short anime and this film which is wildly anticipated. Speaking as a fan, it's quite fulfilling although some people might find one issue with it.In order to understand this movie you need backstory: basically the Shinra Company is sucking Mako energy from the Planet(think of it as the Planet's blood in a sense) and no more Mako then no more Planet. Cloud and a group of friends is trying to take them down and also a man named Sephiroth, a feared and powerful Soldier. They succeed in beating him and a meteor he summoned is vanquished, only to do heavy damage to a huge city known as Midgar. If it sounds confusing I'm sorry, this movie does have a backstory and it's called Final Fantasy VII.In this film it's 2 years later, and Cloud has kind of become an anti-social loner. 3 Silver-Haired Men show up looking for ""Mother"" and believe Cloud is the one to lead them to her. To make matters worse, certain people are infected with Geostigma, a disease that eventually will prove fatal. So the film's really about Cloud and his merry friends trying to save the world again.It's funny how game players understand the plot while Everyman is kind of ""huh?"". What plagued Spirits Within was most couldn't understand it. I did since I'm quite the game player but it baffled mostly everyone else. Advent Children solves this by putting in a small plot and a massive number of action sequences. It does seem like a feeling of style over substance but it's probably the coolest style you'll ever see. Speaking of which, the action sequences are great being exciting and frenetic, one hiccup is that the camera seems overly busy and with characters going turbo speed it's hard to tell what they're doing at times. The big fight in the end is of course extremely awesome and you'll probably watch the scene again once it's finished.Another highlight is its visuals, this is one gorgeous movie and will certainly be one of the prettiest movies in your collection. Some noticed artifacts and such now and then but Square, known for their awesome FMV's in their games show off their talents here and it's stunning at times. The music seems kind of constant without much breaks but it's great anyway although big-time classical fans might hate the metal influences that repeatedly show up. It worked on the FF VII boss theme but here, I don't know, it works half the time.If you've played Final Fantasy VII, you'll love it but you may not like the over abundance of action scenes and the lack of screen time for the rest of the gang. If you haven't played it, you might like it but you probably will have no idea what you're watching and won't make any sense at all.

It was sold out in the first 3 places I searched. Once I got it, I was blown away from the very begining. Oh, and the voice acting was almost perfect(though it would've been awesome if Mr. T played Barret, but his voice actor did great). The ending touched me, and made me think, ""Oh, what a great movie!"" The negetive reviews are by people who just don't get it. The people who made Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children had never made a feature film in their career. And no one has ever made a film sequel to a video game before. So they had no previous work to model on. Just in game FMVs. And they did a great job at it!Overall this is great, although I have a few gripes: The other original characters besdes Cloud, Tifa, Vincent, and Aeris(yes, Aeris) have small roles in the movie. And, the subtitles are usually wrong. But when it comes to the bad parts, that's all folks!(This is just a side note:Tifa is so hot in this movie. And Cait Sith's voice sounds so wierd)I loved disc 2! I haven't checked 100% of it yet, but I love what I've seen. Probably my favorite part is the previews for the new Compilation of FF7 games: Before Crisis(A prequel; cell phone game), Crisis Core(probably a prequel, since Zack is in the anime preview; I aint sure whether it's a movie or a game. I heard a rumor that it'll be a PSP game) and(my favorite preview) Dirge of Cerberus(a sequel starring Vincent!; PS2 or 3).One more thing, I loved the feild shots they did for the credits and the FF7 recap.

Fans of the original still bask in the fond memories the (for its time) revolutionary title brought to them. Newbies, however, are now turned off by the (now) archaic graphics, inconsistent character models, and poor localization that resulted in severely bad English.This game is in dire need of a remake, and rumors have been going around that one is in the works, but in the mean time fans have this little treat to hold them over.For the first time since the original Mortal Kombat a video game movie takes place within the continuity of the game it's based on. This makes it already leaps and bounds better than any other game to film conversion. That said the film is far more visually stunning than its competitors, and the animation is simply breath taking. It brought tears to my eyes when I realized that one day the actual game could look this good, if they remake it... And theoretically it's possible that a PS3 remake of the original could come close. It's beautiful, and unlike other recent CGI films with quasi-realistic characters, Advent Children's characters feature very lifelike eyes, and deliver mostly believable performances except the gravity defying stunts defy suspension of disbelief, yet remain true to the game as many of these stunts are based off of the FFVII Limit Breaks! And they look amazing, even if I don't believe that Cloud could fall several hundred feet and not break anything.The film's story, however, is somewhat problematic. Non-fans shouldn't even bother trying to follow it. There was potential for a very deep film here, but sadly what story there is minimalistic and serves as a device to move from one action sequence to the next. You can tell that the writers of this film are too used to writing for video games, as this sort of writing works well there, but here it leaves a lot to be desired. I was especially disappointed that the party (Barret, Cid, Caith Sith, Yuffie, and Red XIII) didn't really get all that much screen time. Had this film been longer then there could have been some seriously cool character developments. I was particularly disappointed with the final battle, which looked awesome, but really didn't do all that much for the story. Had the Remnant remained the main villain instead of a device to resurrect Sephiroth I would have handled the story a little more seriously. Cheesy resurrections don't go over that well with me.Cloud is the only character that receives any significant character development here. And I'm glad he is able to make peace with himself, but at the same time I am sorely disappointed that there wasn't much by way of romantic developments between Tifa and him. Tifa is obviously in love with him, and I know he's in love with Aerith, but she's dead, and he should have realized by now that Tifa is ga-ga for him and done something about it at the end.This story is not un-enjoyable, its just not very deep. It runs circles around Silent Hill, and would have been a much better expenditure for theater viewing. FFVII isn't going to win an academy award for best screen play or picture, but it certainly wets one's appetite for the rumored remake.",4,"Awkwardly paced, but visually stunning",1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,3205,"['Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'awkward', 'position', 'days', 'Fans', 'original', 'still', 'bask', 'fond', 'time', 'revolutionary', 'title', 'brought', 'Newbies', 'however', 'are', 'now', 'turned', 'off', 'now', 'archaic', 'graphics', 'inconsistent', 'character', 'models', 'poor', 'localization', 'resulted', 'severely', 'bad', 'English.This', 'game', 'dire', 'need', 'remake', 'rumors', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'one', 'works', 'mean', 'time', 'fans', 'have', 'little', 'treat', 'hold', 'over.For', 'first', 'time', 'original', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'place', 'continuity', 'game', 'based', 'already', 'better', 'other', 'game', 'film', 'conversion', 'said', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'visually', 'stunning', 'competitors', 'animation', 'simply', 'breath', 'taking', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'when', 'realized', 'one', 'day', 'actual', 'game', 'could', 'look', 'good', 'remake', 'theoretically', 'possible', 'PS3', 'remake', 'original', 'could', 'come', 'close', 'beautiful', 'other', 'recent', 'CGI', 'films', 'quasi-realistic', 'characters', 'Advent', 'Children', 'characters', 'feature', 'very', 'lifelike', 'eyes', 'deliver', 'mostly', 'believable', 'performances', 'gravity', 'defying', 'stunts', 'defy', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'yet', 'remain', 'true', 'game', 'many', 'stunts', 'are', 'based', 'FFVII', 'Limit', 'Breaks', 'look', 'amazing', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Cloud', 'could', 'fall', 'several', 'hundred', 'feet', 'not', 'break', 'anything.The', 'film', 'story', 'however', 'somewhat', 'problematic', 'Non-fans', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'trying', 'follow', 'was', 'potential', 'very', 'deep', 'film', 'here', 'sadly', 'what', 'story', 'minimalistic', 'device', 'move', 'one', 'action', 'sequence', 'next', 'can', 'tell', 'writers', 'film', 'are', 'too', 'used', 'writing', 'video', 'games', 'sort', 'writing', 'works', 'well', 'there', 'here', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'was', 'especially', 'disappointed', 'party', 'Barret', 'Cid', 'Caith', 'Sith', 'Yuffie', 'Red', 'XIII', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Had', 'film', 'been', 'longer', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'seriously', 'cool', 'character', 'developments', 'was', 'particularly', 'disappointed', 'final', 'battle', 'looked', 'awesome', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'story', 'Had', 'Remnant', 'remained', 'main', 'villain', 'instead', 'device', 'resurrect', 'Sephiroth', 'would', 'have', 'handled', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'seriously', 'Cheesy', 'resurrections', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'over', 'well', 'me.Cloud', 'only', 'character', 'significant', 'character', 'development', 'here', ""'m"", 'glad', 'able', 'make', 'peace', 'same', 'time', 'am', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'way', 'romantic', 'developments', 'Tifa', 'Tifa', 'obviously', 'love', 'know', 'love', 'Aerith', 'dead', 'should', 'have', 'realized', 'now', 'Tifa', 'ga-ga', 'done', 'something', 'end.This', 'story', 'not', 'un-enjoyable', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'deep', 'circles', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'expenditure', 'theater', 'viewing', 'FFVII', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'academy', 'award', 'best', 'screen', 'play', 'picture', 'certainly', 'one', 'appetite', 'rumored', 'remake']",N/A

While the game was extremly fun and interesting - I, like most, was frustrated with all the loop-holes in the story. However, alittle googling can bring great rewards. After seeing the movie; I was once again frustrated as to what was happening. This game (and now movie) has a hard time actually explaining whats going on.. everything moves too fast and has vague dialog writing. This is where a fanbase site/community comes into handy. I realised that my lacking of what ""Jenova"" is, was the key reason why I couldn't figure this movie out... or the game, for that matter. However, I found this site: [...] - best site ever for FF7 information. I read through the entire thing, each section and finally understood FF7 MUCH clearer now. After finally getting a grasp of the events that took place in FF7 and now taking place in Advent Children - the storyline as a whole is very fun and deep. This is the type of storyline where you actually have to do some digging to figure out whats going on - and to fill in the gaps.The movie was stunning. While alittle corney at times (due to all the ""fighting in the air"" anime style - and the overuse of ""bullet-time"" slowing down effect) it still pulls off as an action-packed, jaw-dropping CGI movie. This is a movie you watch 3 or 4 times to see everything. It's very fast pace and sometimes (specially with subtiles) you will miss a lot of things - things that are important to the storyline. The battling scenes give off an epic-feeling - 'specially the ending battle between Cloud and Sephrioth. Reno and Rude were my favorite characters in the movie. They make themselves out to be so bad-ass - but get there butt's kicked throughout the entire movie... until the end, when they get the last laugh.Whether your a fan or not - its worth a watch; whether by download or not, its worth the watch. The CGI alone will blow you away. If you have a loud system (or some good headphones, that are clear) this movie is very intense, the sound FX are clear and loud, and the music is dynomite. You will be lost if you have never played the game or done research to its storyline.

Who cares, though? It's Final Fantasy 7! Cloud and Company back for more action and in breathtaking CGI as well.This film brought the FF geek in me screaming back to life and it feels good. The visuals are great, of course, that seems to be Square's forte. The actual storytelling could be better, IMO, but then again they've got limited time to work with. With this much visual muscle, you almost HAVE to center on action, and leave other more dramatic plot threads (such as Cloud and Tifa's relationship) to doujinshi and perhaps an anime?

928794,AFEOC3D8WKN1D,B000AMJG4Y,Deirdre,"[2, 19]","I'm gonna ask you a guestion, have you ever seen one of those obscure films that supposedly has a deeper meaning? Well this is kinda like one of those, except one problem, it has no meaning at all. In fact, it doesn't even attempt to have a meaning, a reason for it's own existence even. That's just the thing, it's doesn't need too. You see, it has cool CGI, and that's all it needed to keep it's target audience enthralled.The point of this film, is about ""mother"". From the beginning to finale, all that anybody talks about is ""mother"". Now you never really understand what the existance of ""mother"" has to do with the rest of the plot (which constists of this sickness infecting children), but all in all it does.Now, the creators of the film expect people to be enthralled in finding out what mother is, what's gonna happen to the characters and such. They expect to achieve this with no backround to the story, no character development, and no sense of pacing at all. The film is so sure of itself, so blatantly arrogant of the powers it believes it posesses, it doesn't even bother to make sure the viewer is interested, or even has some sense of caring for the character at all. It's like watching the second half of a movie.Now some of you are probably saying, hey man, this was intended for FF fans only. Hear me out, part of the art of making a sequel (or continuation) is giving people who are new to the story a chance to jump into the story by explaining it, and this film does an awful job at it, it doesn't even attempt to care about new audience.In the end, I have to get down to what I'm trying to say. This movie sucked, not even it's cliche, overdone action sequences could save it. It was a good looking mess. A good looking visual effects extravaganza, but even more so, a huge, steaming, piled up mess.

928795,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000AMJG4Y,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[7, 7]","In 2005, fans of the Square Enix Sony PlayStation video game ""Final Fantasy VII"" were excited when a new CG film was released and that video games based on the characters would follow.  The film was well received by fans of the video game but was not received well by critics who were not well versed with ""Final Fantasy VII"" or the games that have come out afterward.The DVD release in 2006 was successful as it became the first direct-to-DVD film to sell over a million copies, in fact worldwide sales were over 2.4 million copies.But a lot has chanced since 2005.  In fact, more backstory to ""Final Fantasy VII"" has been fleshed out with the release with an anime OAV series titled ""Last Order"",  of a mobile game (not released in the US) titled ""Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII"", ""Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII"" for the PS2, ""Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII"" for the Sony PSP.Here we are with ""Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete"".  Despite being announced at the Tokyo Game Show in 2006 for a Blu-ray release, Square Enix postponed the release until 2009.  The main difference is that this film would feature 26 minutes of new footage and over 1,000 revised scenes.  Although the Blu-ray scene in Japan has been slow compared to other countries in terms of copies sold,  the release of FF7:ACC sold over 100,000 copies in its first day, the highest selling Blu-ray in Japan was ""Macross F"" which sold over 34,000 in 2008.For the fans who played the video games that came after 2005, especially the Sony PSP video game ""Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII"", it furthers the fan's appreciation of this film.  In fact, the new footage actually makes the film much more coherent and enjoyable.  But like the original release of ""Advent Children"", if one had no interest in the video game to begin with, nor have they had a vested interest in the ""Final Fantasy VII"" video game series, they probably still won't get it.  But as a person who has played the games (with the exception of ""Before Crisis""), I felt that ""FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN COMPLETE"" was much more enjoyable this time around.VIDEO & AUDIO:""FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN COMPLETE"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1).  When the film was released in 2005, the animation was realistic and just awesome to look at.  The animation still holds up four years later but part of the problem is that the video is upconverted.  The extra 30 minutes is pretty much all throughout the film but for those with a keen eye, you can tell which piece looks upconverted and which doesn't.  The newer scenes are much crisper and sharper.  But for the most part, depending on your TV, many people probably will not know the difference on the Blu-ray but comparing to the DVD, the image quality is of course, much, much better.There are a lot of details in the newer scenes from books, papers scattered on the shelves.  You will now see dirt and grime on the people getting into the fights.  You will also see more footage of people around Midgar, more to the buildings and destruction around the city and just more additional footage that made the film much better.  Scenes and backgrounds come out quite clearly on the video that even scenes where characters are looking out windows, you can see the backgrounds through the windows much clearer.I also want to add that there were certain scenes that displayed white speckles.  Although I didn't see compression artifacts, I was surprised to see this a few times in the video but very few times. Overall, picture quality was very good.The audio features a lossless track with an English, Japanese and French Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track (note: The Japanese version does not have the French audio track nor does it contain the English subtitles).  To be truthful, I was hoping the sound would be much immersive and that there would be full utilization of audio throughout all channels but FF7:ACC was more front channel heavy with occasional panning of sound but I didn't hear any low level frequency bass coming out of my subwoofer, nor did I really hear anything coming out throughout my rear surrounds.  But the dialogue, the awesome music and action scenes with swords clanging and destruction of buildings do come out quite clearly through your front and center channel speakers.Also, when it comes to voice acting both Japanese and English are well done.  Square Enix really went all out by having actresses Mena Suvari and Rachael Leigh Cook to lend their voices to the characters but overall, both audio tracks were well done.  If anything, I tend to prefer the Tifa ""tsuru tsuru tsuru tsuru"" than the ""dilly dally shilly shally"" but overall, I enjoyed both.  I did not watch the film with the French dub track though.As for subtitles, the Blu-ray features English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified), Korean, Thai, Arabic and Dutch.  The Japanese version only features Japanese subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:""FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN COMPLETE"" includes a good number of special features.  Included are:* Legacy of Final Fantasy - (6:37) This featurette features a quick history of the ""Final Fantasy"" video games and then leads up to the screening at the Venice International Film Festival, discussion of how the DVD sold over a million copies in Japan, 3.6 worldwide which is unprecedented for a direct-to-video release.  And also the release of this latest Blu-ray release which features nearly 30 minutes of extra footage and 1,000 revised scenes.* Reminiscence of Final Fantasy VII - (23:55) A featurette/digest that features the replaying of the story of ""Final Fantasy VII"" from the Sony PlayStation.  For those who haven't played the video game or it has been too many years that has passed by since you did play the game, this is a good refresher on the original video game.* Reminiscence of Final Fantasy VII Compilation - (29:43) Where the original digest featured ""Final Fantasy VII"", this time the stories from ""Beginning Crisis"", ""Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII"" and ""Dirge of Cerberus"" are featured.  So, if you never played any of these three video games, you can watch this featurette and learn about the Turks, the relation between Zack and Cloud and also how the FF7 group especially Vincent have started assisting the World Regenesis Organization (WRO).* On the Way to a Smile - Episode: Denzel - (28:04) The following anime OAV takes place right after ""Advent Children"" and focuses on the orphan Denzel who is inspired by Cloud and his friends to be a member of the WRO.  Denzel shares his story about his family and then living in the slums but most importantly information on how the disease Geostigma started to affect the people of Midgar and how quickly it spread and how people started to die.* Exclusive Sneak Peak at Final Fantasy XIII - (7:12) A sneak peak of the upcoming ""Final Fantasy"" PlayStation 3/XBOX 360 video game.* Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete Trailers - A total of five trailers.  The original teaser trailers for Advent Children and the teaser trailer for ""Advent Children Complete"".In Japan, a playable demo for ""Final Fantasy XIII"" was offered.  Also, the Blu-ray came in a black Blu-ray case.  In the US, the version comes with a slip case and in the standard blue Blu-ray case.  Since ""Final Fantasy"" games in the US tend to come out nearly a year and more later after the Japanese release, it was expected that there would not be a playable demo of the game with this release.  Both the Japanese and the US release do not contain the 2005 anime OAV ""Last Order: Final Fantasy VII"" which was included in the ""Ultimate Edition"" DVD release for ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"" back in the Fall of 2005.JUDGMENT CALL:When ""ADVENT CRISIS"" was released, I truly found the release to be action-packed and visually, incredible.  From the facial mannerisms of each character, to the details of each character model including the buildings and the roads.  So, much went into this project of creating a side of realism with the character models.  It was amazing what ""Final Fantasy: Spirits Within"" was able to achieve in CG back then but to see how far it has evolved with ""Advent Children"" and the fact that unlike the previous ""Final Fantasy"" film, there was now an emotional attachment previously from the FF7 video game and now to this film.But where the original film seemed like eye candy and action-packed sequences that were a definite nod to the fans who enjoyed the series, the release of ""FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN COMPLETE"" is much more satisfying as the storyline seems much more coherent now than before.  Also, since the release of the original Advent Children, there have been additional FF7 video games that gave us more storyline of things behind-the-scenes with the SOLDIER program and most of all, the relationship between Sephiroth, Cloud and Zack.After finishing ""Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII"", the video game gave me a stronger understanding of why Sephiroth became this madman bent on destruction but most of all, why Cloud kept thinking about his old friend and why he fights with his sword.  Many questions answered in these last three years from the video games that makes things much more easier this time around when watching ""Advent Children Complete"".With the release of ""FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN COMPLETE"", with how much time I have invested in the ""Final Fantasy"" video games but specifically the FF7 releases, I found watching the film this time around, much more enjoyable.  I found myself noticing mannerisms in the face of Tifa and the children, Cloud's conflicted emotions with having the Geostigma disease and just small details which I never took noticed before until now.This is more than a re-release to Blu-ray but an enhancement of the original release.  Many of you are wondering if you own it on DVD, is it worth the double dip.  The answer is YES!  It really is worth purchasing on Blu-ray.  Newer storyline, newer features but it's not going to change non-FF7 fans or those not at all familiar with the series to enjoy it.  But for those who truly enjoy ""Final Fantasy VII"", have played the recent releases and want a much better version of the film than what we bought back in 2006, then ""FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN COMPLETE"" is highly recommended!",5,"Blu-ray:  Much better this time around with the new features, video is not perfect but nevertheless a solid release!",1243987200,"06 3,

Miller ""Derek Fawaz""","[0, 0]","I remember back when I was eight years old in Elementary school when I played Final Fantasy VII with my brother continuously, yet never could get quite attach to the ending which I felt ended rather abrupt for the characters.  Ironically seven years later creator Tetsuya Nomura and the Square Enix team create a beautiful CGI animated film sequel. This thrilled me because I've always wanted an appropriate conclusion to the story of these wonderful characters. The story follows Cloud Strife and his team in an epic struggle to keep the world cleansed of his arch-nemesis, the evil SOLDIER Sephiroth as he comes to terms with the deaths of his friend Zack and love, Aeris. The film has fantastic detail and texture of the people and the city, Midgar's new town called ""Edge"" where the characters and the people take refuge.  This includes Cloud's long time friends and fellow allies: Barrett Wallace, Cid Highwind, Tifa lockheart, Vincent Valentine, Cait Sith, and Red XIII who are all back in full prime.  The main villain of the story is still Sephiroth, instead taking the forms of young remnants Kadaj, Loz, Yahzoo and a fatal disease known as, ""Geostigma"" that affects a person's nervous system.  Cloud is infected with the disease along with the children, Denzel and Marlena giving him a reason to investigate the abnormality left by the demise of his adversary. Cloud has been haunted for two years since he defeated Sephiroth and his birth source Jenova, a memory that has driven him away from the people he loves. Memories of Aeris dying from Sephiroth and Jenova and the death of Zack have rendered Cloud in a state of failure in finding a cure for the disease that threatens to kill the children and himself.  His confrontation with Kadaj, seeking Jenova's head in order to revive the last trace of Sephiroth, thrusts Cloud back into his original mission. With Cloud's determination to be forgiven and to take up the sword once more with his friends, Cloud is determined to save the planet and the children he cares for from potential genocide. The Complete Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is the definite film and a wonderful conclusion to the FFVII story. A spectacular piece of animation and visual effects combined with the enhanced score composed by the game's original composer. A film that uses its beautiful effects to bring powerful emotion to the viewer.  The footage of the final battle, climax, and end credits have been restored with awesome additions that bring the story to an excellent finish that the characters in FFVII deserved for seven years of good memories.",5,Final Fantasy VII has a complete ending,1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,2596,"['remember', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'Elementary', 'school', 'when', 'played', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'brother', 'continuously', 'yet', 'never', 'could', 'get', 'quite', 'attach', 'ending', 'felt', 'ended', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'characters', 'Ironically', 'seven', 'years', 'later', 'creator', 'Tetsuya', 'Nomura', 'Square', 'Enix', 'team', 'create', 'beautiful', 'CGI', 'animated', 'film', 'sequel', 'thrilled', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'appropriate', 'conclusion', 'story', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'story', 'Cloud', 'Strife', 'team', 'epic', 'struggle', 'keep', 'world', 'cleansed', 'arch-nemesis', 'evil', 'SOLDIER', 'Sephiroth', 'terms', 'deaths', 'friend', 'Zack', 'love', 'Aeris', 'film', 'fantastic', 'detail', 'texture', 'people', 'city', 'Midgar', 'new', 'town', 'called', 'Edge', 'where', 'characters', 'people', 'take', 'refuge', 'Cloud', 'long', 'time', 'friends', 'fellow', 'allies', 'Barrett', 'Wallace', 'Cid', 'Highwind', 'Tifa', 'lockheart', 'Vincent', 'Valentine', 'Cait', 'Sith', 'Red', 'XIII', 'who', 'are', 'back', 'full', 'prime', 'main', 'villain', 'story', 'still', 'Sephiroth', 'instead', 'taking', 'forms', 'young', 'remnants', 'Kadaj', 'Loz', 'Yahzoo', 'fatal', 'disease', 'known', 'Geostigma', 'person', 'nervous', 'system', 'Cloud', 'infected', 'disease', 'children', 'Denzel', 'Marlena', 'giving', 'reason', 'investigate', 'abnormality', 'left', 'demise', 'adversary', 'Cloud', 'been', 'haunted', 'two', 'years', 'defeated', 'Sephiroth', 'birth', 'source', 'Jenova', 'memory', 'driven', 'away', 'people', 'Memories', 'Aeris', 'dying', 'Sephiroth', 'Jenova', 'death', 'Zack', 'have', 'rendered', 'Cloud', 'state', 'failure', 'finding', 'cure', 'disease', 'kill', 'children', 'confrontation', 'Kadaj', 'seeking', 'Jenova', 'head', 'order', 'revive', 'last', 'trace', 'Sephiroth', 'Cloud', 'back', 'original', 'mission', 'Cloud', 'determination', 'be', 'forgiven', 'take', 'up', 'sword', 'once', 'more', 'friends', 'Cloud', 'determined', 'save', 'planet', 'children', 'potential', 'genocide', 'Complete', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'Advent', 'Children', 'definite', 'film', 'wonderful', 'conclusion', 'FFVII', 'story', 'spectacular', 'piece', 'animation', 'visual', 'effects', 'combined', 'enhanced', 'score', 'composed', 'game', 'original', 'composer', 'film', 'beautiful', 'effects', 'bring', 'powerful', 'emotion', 'viewer', 'footage', 'final', 'battle', 'climax', 'end', 'credits', 'have', 'been', 'restored', 'awesome', 'additions', 'bring', 'story', 'excellent', 'finish', 'characters', 'FFVII', 'deserved', 'seven', 'years', 'good', 'memories']",N/A
928797,A2F7PEA3G37YDT,B000AMJG4Y,dylan21484nj,"[1, 3]","taking place two years after the events of the Final Fantasy VII video game, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children reunites us with Cloud Strife, who has since given up saving the world for the life of a motorcycle-riding package courier. but Cloud has been inflicted with a deadly illness called Geostigma, an ailment that now plagues many of the citizens of Edge, the remnance of the formerly bustling metropolis Midgar.but Geostigma is not the only looming threat. a trio of silver-maned strangers named Kadaj, Loz, and Wazoo arrive, searching for the remains of Jenova, the alien being who nearly wiped out humanity thousands of years ago and whose DNA led to the creation of Final Fantasy VII's iconic villain, Sephiroth. The terrible trio want to use Jenova's cells to revive Sephiroth, and it's up to Cloud to once again step up and save the world from total destruction.the CG is gorgeous, the voice capture is adequate (this film wasn't made primarily for American audiences, so it can be forgiven) the action is fast-paced and amazing. this is one feature the gravity-defying Matrix-style anime action isn't out of place, since it would be extremely hard to duplicate the number-based battles from the games in a thrilling, visually-stimulating way.people unfamiliar with the games will find the CG astounding, but will probably not be able to understand the story since it relies quite heavily on the events from the game. but unlike other movies adapted from video games, this film wasn't made to appeal to theatergoers unfamiliar with the games, nor was it made just to bilk money from gamers by making a film with only some passing relation to the game and just slapping the game's name on it.there's a reason why this film went directedly to DVD - it's a ""thank you"" from the makers of the game to the fans who made the game and its characters so popular. they even dedicate the movie to the fans at the beginning and thank them at the end. if you haven't played the game (and why haven't you? it's only considered by many to be one of the greatest games ever made and the video game equivalent to the original Star Wars), it certainly helps to play it first to familiarize yourself with the backstory if you wish to understand most of what is going on.",5,Absolutely Stunning...,1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,2265,"['taking', 'place', 'two', 'years', 'events', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'video', 'game', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'Advent', 'Children', 'Cloud', 'Strife', 'who', 'given', 'up', 'saving', 'world', 'life', 'motorcycle-riding', 'package', 'courier', 'Cloud', 'been', 'inflicted', 'deadly', 'illness', 'called', 'Geostigma', 'ailment', 'now', 'many', 'citizens', 'Edge', 'remnance', 'formerly', 'bustling', 'metropolis', 'Midgar.but', 'Geostigma', 'not', 'only', 'looming', 'threat', 'trio', 'silver-maned', 'strangers', 'named', 'Kadaj', 'Loz', 'Wazoo', 'arrive', 'searching', 'remains', 'Jenova', 'alien', 'being', 'who', 'nearly', 'wiped', 'out', 'humanity', 'thousands', 'years', 'ago', 'DNA', 'led', 'creation', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'iconic', 'villain', 'Sephiroth', 'terrible', 'trio', 'want', 'use', 'Jenova', 'cells', 'revive', 'Sephiroth', 'up', 'Cloud', 'once', 'again', 'step', 'up', 'save', 'world', 'total', 'destruction.the', 'CG', 'gorgeous', 'voice', 'capture', 'adequate', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'primarily', 'American', 'audiences', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'action', 'fast-paced', 'amazing', 'one', 'feature', 'gravity-defying', 'Matrix-style', 'anime', 'action', ""n't"", 'place', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'hard', 'duplicate', 'number-based', 'battles', 'games', 'thrilling', 'visually-stimulating', 'way.people', 'unfamiliar', 'games', 'will', 'find', 'CG', 'astounding', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'story', 'quite', 'heavily', 'events', 'game', 'other', 'movies', 'adapted', 'video', 'games', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'appeal', 'theatergoers', 'unfamiliar', 'games', 'was', 'made', 'just', 'bilk', 'money', 'gamers', 'making', 'film', 'only', 'passing', 'relation', 'game', 'just', 'slapping', 'game', 'name', 'it.there', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'went', 'directedly', 'DVD', 'thank', 'makers', 'game', 'fans', 'who', 'made', 'game', 'characters', 'so', 'popular', 'even', 'dedicate', 'movie', 'fans', 'beginning', 'thank', 'end', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'game', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'only', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'games', 'ever', 'made', 'video', 'game', 'equivalent', 'original', 'Star', 'Wars', 'certainly', 'play', 'first', 'familiarize', 'backstory', 'wish', 'understand', 'most', 'what', 'going']",N/A
928798,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000AMJG4Y,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","""Final Fantasy VII"" is one of the most groundbreaking, most popular video games of all time -- the adventures of flawed hero Cloud Strife and his companions, struggling to save a very self-aware planet.Turns out that the battle isn't QUITE over. ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"" picks up a couple years later with new threats to the planet and new silver-haired foes (plus one old one). It's an absolutely stunning piece of work -- though the plot takes awhile to fully sink in, it's awash in beautifully precise, slightly luminous animation, slam-bang action scenes, and some beautifully complex characters,People are falling ill with a mysterious disease called Geostigma. And while Cloud is tooling around in the desert, he's suddenly attacked by a trio of silver-haired youths (Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo) who demand to know where ""Mother"" is. Weirdly enough, they also call him ""brother."" Plagued by guilt and geostigma, Cloud isn't terribly interested in finding out about the trio or their connection to Jenova's missing head.But then Loz savagely beats up Tifa in the cathedral, and kidnaps Marlene -- along with all the geostigma-riddled children in Midgar. Unfortunately, Cloud's attempt to get back the kids meets with more failure. And as the brother lay waste to Midgar with materia-generated beasts, Cloud's friends reunite to stop them. And when Kadaj gets his hands on the head, it resurrects an old enemy who may be able to destroy the entire planet...""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"" is one of those movies that takes awhile to sink in, and which (at first glance) seems much more complex than it actually is. It's actually a pretty straightforward tale of a hero overcoming his doubts and trying to save the world. But that story is swathed in a heavy dose of symbolism, and many reflections about how you should live for your friends, not mope about the dead.The writing generally tends toward meditative and slightly poetic (""What I want, Cloud, is to sail the darkness of the cosmos with this planet as my vessel...""), wit a sprinkling of dry humor (""Where can I buy a phone?""). And it's crammed with top-notch action scenes -- treetop sword fights, acrobatic motorcycle chases, and a citywide attack from the monstrous Bahamut Sin. The climactic fight is the best: the city is enveloped in a vast cloud of dust and crumbling ruins, as Cloud battles physically and emotionally with his old nemesis Sephiroth.And the animation is a thing of pure beauty. Square Enix outdid themselves with the clarity and vibrancy of the CGI -- luminous flowers and trees, a grey sky, a ruined city, and eerie smoky monsters that rise up and attack. Even the tiny details -- like the texture of Kadaj's leather coat -- are rendered in beautiful detail.Cloud is a likable tortured hero, who works up from despair to quiet strength -- partly from his friends needing him, and partly from Aerith's occasional admonitions from beyond the grave (""I think... I want to be forgiven... More than anything..."").

So i preordered it.The movie itself deserves 10 stars. The characters and environments were beautifully made.It probably would have helped if i knew what had happened in the actual game but at least it gives you something to figure out. It is a small thing put together of the game, only bad thing is its in japanese...One thing that almost all these reviews are missing is the music. The music is wonderful, very instrumental. And it seemed to match the scene well.The story seemed good, was kind of hard to understand. The only other place i have seen FF characters at is in Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2. So that is the only place i know them from.Now i am going to do something people really hate. I enjoyed the english version of this movie. The actors and actresses all seemed to fit into the characters the played. The only creepy one was Kadaj or whatever his name was. But i think he was suppose to be creepy. I think people that talk bad about english voice actors are crazy. But i would rather listen to them then keep my eyes pasted to the bottom of the screen reading subtitles.Over allThis movie was great, i would definitely buy it again if i needed to.

The story is directly related to the events of the Playstation game Final Fantasy 7 but the story within this movie is hardly worth telling. The only good thing about the movie script is that it brings back all the heroes that gamers grew to love in the original game. This CGI movie is beautiful to look at but is basically hollow at its core. The action is good, but I've seen better action combat in recent anime movies like Appleseed or Steamboy. The voice acting is OK but it never seems to truely fit in with the actions, movements, or emotions of the CGI characters on screen. I guess my greatest issue with this movie is that F.F.7 for the PS1 had such an epic and sweeping storyline that Advent Children feels so small and pointless compared to the great storytelling that inspired it. The bonus materials on Disc 2 are just OK with nothing truely amazing to mention. I know that a large group of Final Fantasy fans are ready to buy this DVD by the thousands, and they should.

Since I don't have a Hi-Def tv yet, I can't make much comment on how great the resolution is. What I can say is that I do think the the visuals are beautiful and on a regular tv, they look fantastic. Thanks to the reediting and addition of scenes, the movie is alot more easier to follow with depth given to characters such as Denzel. I recall hearing that when creating this movie, the creaters weren't fully happy with the results. This is probably what they were really looking for in the end.

928803,A3S1YIQQW7AZO,B000AMJG4Y,EMAN NEP,"[6, 25]","When I first saw Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, I thought that it was an outstanding movie. I rated it 4/5 stars here on Amazon. My friend on the other hand thought that it was rather pathetic. Looking back at my review that I wrote some years ago I have to agree that 4/5 is being too generous. Spirits Within is only a 3 star movie at best. It amazing how hype can warp someone's mind.Now there's Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Thank God, it's not about space marines and plant-lovers. Instead it is a sequel  to FF7 that brings Cloud's story to closure. I think it is better to think of this ""movie"" as a ""belated FMV"" or ""the REAL FMV that  one was supposed to see after beating FF7"". As a movie, as film, as cinema, it downright flops.The name Final Fantasy is synonymous with several things:Great characters/ character development (Cloud, Aeris, Kefka, Sephiroth, Vivi, etc.)Great graphics (even the NES Final Fantasies had good graphics for their time)Great music (Thank you Nobuo Uematsu)Great plot/storyline (Final Fantasy 6, 7, 9 and 10)Unfortunately, this ""movie"" only masters two of those.The graphics in this ""movie"" are outstanding! And I thought they were good in Spirits Within, but Advent Children raises the bar.And I was soooo happy to see that Nobuo Uematsu took the helm in the music department. You'll get to hear all sorts of variations of popular tunes from the FF7 game in this ""movie"". Yes, there is a variation of ""One-Winged Angel"".But the parts where Advent Children fails is in the character development and storyline. If someone never played FF7, they will have no clue who Cloud is, why Aeris is important and why Sephiroth is the bad guy. As for the storyline, I thought that the storyline for the actual game FF7 was great . . . but also dreadfully confusing, especially towards the end. And if you don't have a good grasp of things to begin with, how can one possibly understand what is going on in Advent Children? The whole Geostigma thing made no sense to me as did the importance of ""Mother's neck"".*sigh* If only Square had a computer program that could crank out storylines as good as the graphics.But my biggest problem with the ""movie"" was the fight scenes. Cloud's swords and motorcycle LOOK awesome, but just about every fight scene jerks around as if two kids were fighting with a VCR remote: one kid hitting the slow-motion button and the other kid alternately pressing the Play and Fast Forward button.But most ridiculous is how everybody flies around like Superman, climbs the sides of buildings like Spiderman, and, well, pretty much give all the laws of physics the middle finger.Most ridiculous is the scene where there is this REUNION (of Cloud and Co., ironically) and they each take turns tossing Cloud hundreds of feet into the air.As nostalgiac FMV, Advent Children will make you feel that Cloud's story has finally come to an agreeable end, but as movie?

I never played the games, and I had no major problems understanding the plot of the movie, as there is a fairly helpful voice-over intro that explains the basic world and the current problem and nemesis. For those who need more background, watch the Special Features Disk first; it has an overview of most of the games, done in sprite format (seems to be cut and pasted from the different major cut scenes). It will fill in a lot of gaps, for those who want to know what's going on in more detail before they watch the film. The character designs are lovely, and the plot is engaging.

With beautiful images with vibrant colours and attention to detail, I was impressed.What I didn't like about this film was the story and voice acting.  The story is very bland and hard to follow with questions of ""whats going on now?"" and ""what the hell is that thing?"".  A lot of strange things happen in this film that are impossible, but the film does have 'Fantasy' in the title so thats acceptable.  The voice acting is quite bad making the characters a little bland, while villians sound less threatening.What I did like about this film was the fantastic visuals and blink-and-you'll-miss-it action.  The action is so fast and so furious that you just can't take your eyes off the screen in case you miss something.Since I found the story bad and the voice acting bad, this still is a great film, with lightning speed action thats impossible to accomplish in real time.

928808,A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B000AMJG4Y,Feelah the tigress,"[0, 0]","Below is my original review written for the 2-disc special edition dvd version of Advent Children, which is quite different from Advent Children Complete.  My review for the Advent Children Complete Bluray follows the original review (in which I've changed my mind about the film quite a bit).________________________________________________________________________Original Advent Children DVD review:Sigh. I loved FF7. I still play it even today. It's one of my most cherished games. Imagine my excitement when I first heard about a movie sequel to one of my favorite games. I kept my eye on the forums for every scrap of information about the movie before it came out. I was excited. So, why the 2-star review? Well, that would be because of the major disappointment that this movie really is. When I first watched it I thought it was a great movie, I loved it; it was awesome.  Then I watched it a second time and actually felt bored and disinterested - I could barely sit through it. Then it dawned on me; if this movie were actually good, I wouldn't be having such a hard time sitting through it.WARNING! Spoilers be ahead!!!!!First of all, the plot is a mess. I've overplayed FF7 (as you should know from what I said earlier), so I understand what the references in the movie meant. I don't need to be told who ""mother"" is or the significance of Sephiroth's return.  I understand these things.  So, my dislike for the plot is not based on my ignorance of in-game references, it's based on the fact that the plot stinks. I mean why would there suddenly be all these new Sephiroth clones? Didn't the resurrection of Sephiroth seem forced? Rufus really should've stayed dead (although I love his character and was secretly delighted to see him; according to the plot, keeping him dead makes more sense). Speaking of which, did anyone notice that Aeris (who should've been completely dead and returned to the planet) became a sort of Deus ex Machina that completely resolved all plot problems at the end? Overall, the entire movie ended with me feeling that nothing significant took place at all. I don't really feel that this movie added to the story of the game; it feels more like a tacked-on money-making excuse to exploit FF7 fans. Should've called it ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent of the Money-Making Sequel"".Furthermore, what happened to all my beloved characters?! Cloud is strangely guilty about Aeris's death when he gave no indication of this feeling in the game. He was sad (appropriately) but not guilty. Also, they turned Tifa into a nagging wench. Why? I used to like her (still do in the game). All she does the entire movie is nag Cloud about this and that--you'd think that saving the world ought to merit you some free time, but no, Tifa demands he do all the things she wants. As for the other characters, you barely see them at all. Not to mention, that ridiculous scene where they all take turns throwing each other upward is laughable. Speaking of which, the battle scenes are ridiculously full of slow-motion and gravity-defying nonsense. I can stand a couple unrealistically high jumps, but the only one who should be able to fly is Vincent.The only real high point to this movie is the beautiful graphics (that's what earns this 2 stars). The graphics are stunning, and lend themselves to making excellent computer wallpapers. But, honestly, given the quality of the rest of this movie, Square-Enix really should have just released a software bundle of some fancy wallpapers and screensavers for all the FF7 fans out there.________________________________________________________________________Advent Children Complete Review:When I first purchased Advent Children (I had the two disc special edition), I was greatly disappointed with the film.  I sat down and wrote a scathing review in anger.  You have to understand, I'm a huge FF7 fan.  I spent an entire year in anticipation of this film; I posted in a forum devoted to this very film every other day for a whole year like an obsessive, crazed nutter who desperately needed to get a life.  Me and the people on that thread spent all our time dissecting trailers and speculating wildly about this film; we even had the identity of the ""sheeted wheelchair person"" figured out long before the film's release.  So, you can kind of see the level of ""fan-ness"" I was at.  All that being said, it kind of makes sense why I was so disappointed--nothing in existence could possibly live up to hype and expectations like that.  In many ways, I shot myself in the foot by staying on that forum and obsessing like a psycho.  If only I'd never even heard of the film until it released, I could have picked it up and enjoyed it for the first time with a fresh perspective.  Then maybe I would've seen it for what it is: a fan-servicey action flick starring the cast of FF7.  I was expecting a moving drama that would shake the heavens and earth and make me weep tears of joy and sadness all at the same time.  It's no wonder I was disappointed, but, if you take it as a simple action flick designed to please a bunch of fans, it's surprisingly good.The Complete version does a lot to fix my complaints from the original review.  I feel like the plot is more fluid now and makes better sense.  Even though they still don't quite explain where those three Sephiroth clones came from, I've completely changed my mind about some of my earlier complaints.  I no longer feel like bringing Rufus back was a mistake.  His character has been really built upon and I now feel like his character development is a poignant part of the story rather than a cheap attempt at fan service (not that there isn't fan service in droves, but I'll get to that later).  I no longer feel so irritated that Zack and Aeris appeared despite the fact that they are supposed to be dead because it now fits in with the theme of the movie (i.e. past memories, life and death, etc).  I also feel like Cloud's behavior is much better explained in this version.  Also, the fight scenes are more interesting and better developed.Some of my complaints still stand though.  Tifa still strikes me as a nagging wench (although I kind of better understand now why she's that way).  And, it's still true that this movie basically gives very little screen time to the other characters.  Of course, if everyone has extra screen time, this movie would end up being some kind of four hour long abomination that no one would be able to sit through, so it kind of makes sense.  Still, it feels a bit like a Final Fantasy VII Christmas Special in the sense that they tried to jam every last popular character into at least some sort of cameo role so that no one would be offended.  And once again, I understand why they had to get Cait Sith in there (even though he's pretty pointless); if they'd left someone out there would have been a public outcry.  I complained about the fight scenes in my original review, but I like them much better now.  However, I still don't like the scene where Cloud's friends throw him upward to face Bahamut (summoned with a green material, no less).  The reason I still don't like this scene is because it still looks stupid.  I'm willing to forgive the people who are standing on something and help him up, but Yuffie (and other characters) just jump up in mid-air and then grab Cloud and throw him up further.  It just looks stupid and defies physics to a degree that even I can't excuse (I was fine with all the other fight scenes until that point; the difference being that those scenes looked cool and this looks terribly stupid).  My last complaint is that this whole movie feels at times like a cell phone commercial.  At the scene where Vincent says he has no phone, I kept expecting it to cut to a commercial (""Don't get caught without a phone like poor Vincent. Buy a Shinra brand cell phone today!).  Ha ha, seriously...Now, let's talk about the good things that this version adds.  Firstly, almost 30 minutes of new scenes were added, and they weren't wasted on frivolous things--it's all to help the plot and character development (and a kick@zz longer fight scene between Cloud and Sephiroth!).  The Turks and Rufus get much more screen time (fleshing them out as characters) and Cloud and Co. are given more dialogue to help explain their motivations.  Even Denzel gets more screen time so that we as an audience can actually understand why he's even in this movie.  Reno and Rude even get more scenes.  And yes, I know that many people have complained that poor Reno has become the designated comic relief, but I don't feel like his character was demeaned in any way from it like some movies tend to do with their comic relief.  I burst out laughing when he almost hit Rude in the face with his Mag Rod.  I've always felt like Reno was a little reckless and silly and I feel like they stayed true to his character and maintained his dignity while still providing the audience with some humor.  Many of the battle scenes were also extended and retooled so that they are much more engaging now.  The plot still isn't going to win any awards for being a deep and moving drama, but it all flows much better now with the new editing and makes much more sense.New scenes weren't all that was added though.  The music has been updated and so have the graphics.  Also, blood and dirt effects have been added, which is a huge plus.  Now I know what you're thinking, that I'm some violence mongering idiot who isn't happy unless blood sprays everywhere, but that just isn't true.  This film is really the first time I have ever wished that there was more blood shown.  In the original version, Cloud fights a bunch and even gets stabbed, but you don't see a single drop of blood.  No scuffs or dirt from falling.  No nothing.  It was really hard to empathize with any of the characters because they never really seemed to get hurt.  When you see Cloud get skewered by Sephiroth in this version and he falls to the ground dripping blood, it suddenly feels much more real and painful.  You actually feel some fear for our Chocobo-headed hero.So, lastly, I'd like to talk about special features and the darn menu screen.  The menu screen is written in such tiny letters that I found them to be nigh unreadable.  Of course, I was watching all this on a standard definition TV (I know, my fault, huh?) but I can't really imagine these being much more readable on an HDTV either.  Anyway, the Special Features differ between this Bluray release and the DVD release.  The DVD actually has things that the Bluray doesn't have, the most important being a ""making-of"".  However, the Bluray does have something extra which I think is definitely worth seeing, an anime short called ""On the Way to a Smile"".  This short features Denzel and tells his entire back story, which is quite dramatic and poignant (ironically what I wanted Advent Children to be like).  Well, I think I've rambled on enough.  The bottom line is, if you've already seen the original Advent Children and loved it, or if you saw it and were disappointed, then you should pick up this version and give it a try.  It will either make you love it more or hate it less. If you've never seen Advent Children at all, then this is definitely the version to own, hands down.",4,This new release has changed my mind on Advent Children...,1221523200,"09 16,

Cloud Strife, buried in a sea of grief and drifting further and further from the things he loves, must fight the threat back while simultaneously attempting to remember what he cherishes most.For those of us who have played the game just having the characters CGed so well gets us giddier than a child at Christmastime.  What's more is that the story is actually good!  It does a fine job of sticking to the shadows of the video game with the way humor melts with drama and action swirls together with story.  In addition the movie combines aspects of the game like materia and how it is used and giving living, abstract personality to characters that were analyzed only through written dialogue and jerky movements.  Even the interactions and relationship between Reno and Rude are pristine.This edition also has additional features such as a ""Making of"" , ""Deleted Scenes"", and some of the trailers from the original advertising of the movie.

I was in so much pain because I could literally not stop laughing at how bad this movie is.  The dialog is awful, (need i repeat the 'Dilly Dally' line?), the action is so fast you can't tell what's going on, the voice acting is terrible, the plot is extremely silly.  Some might say that you can't understand the plot unless you beat the game, but unless the game explains why so many explosions can happen and not a single person gets a scratch, or how nobody's hair ever gets ruined by anything, (what ever gel they use is water, wind, flame, bomb, fighting, and even getting hit over the head resistant!).  Maybe the game will also explain why Tifa is so worthless.  She fights one time and loses, then she basically just stands their whenever something happens.  Also in one part, the city is being destroyed and she is cracking jokes to a little kid like as if nothing is happening.  Maybe the game will explain why when that monster is summoned and blows up half the city, nobody gets hurt, not even the regular people,  and then when it sees all the side fights happen, it takes a nap until they are all done before it starts destroying the city again.  Maybe the game will also explain how one of the character's glasses are bomb resistant but not step-on proof.  Or how one minute Cloud can't fly but the next minute he can.  Or how that water just happens to be under his house.  Or how everyone has so many expensive things even though they are in the middle of a great depression. Or maybe it explains how the dead girl can leave Cloud a message on his cell phone's answering machine.  Or maybe it explains why the bad guys have Britney Spears hair.  I'm not even going to start my rant on the whole 'Mother' situation.  The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because the graphics are amazing.  That's it.  Even if they made this movie about Final Fantasy X, which I beat both and love the characters, I would still be disappointed because the only utilized character in the movie is Cloud.  Everyone else just stands their.  If this was a FFX movie I would be mad because I hated Tidus and liked everyone else.  This movie is so awesomely bad that I could watch it over and over again.

A society reduced to some erratic mass movements of fear or violence. Some young people, men and women, identified as the children of a mythic father and mother are divided between the group of those who control the masses and this ruinous world, and on the other hand the group of those who are rebelling and claiming to conquer some kind of future. And that's where the archetype comes into play. This future is identified to going back to what the past splendor of this world was, to rebuilding the city that history has destroyed. It is systematically the nostalgic rebuilding of a past glory that used to be the realm of the parents, or maybe grand parents, ancestors for sure. But we are obliged to doubt all that nostalgic back tripping good intentional apocalypse. It is a myth to believe history can move back. It is a myth to believe the younger generation who has hardly known the past will want to go back to it. It is a myth to believe a world of advanced technology, cell phones among many others, will be able to regress to an ancient time when there could not be any of these brilliant inventions.

928824,A26O0T192IBKY1,B000AMJG4Y,J. Alford,"[1, 1]","After years of waiting for a followup to their original groundbreaking RPG video game, Square Enix(original Squaresoft)finally got around to doing this feature animated sequal as part of their Compilation Of Final Fantasy VII series which also included two video game prequals, a game sequal, and an anime prequal. Even though it was originally supposed to be about a 20 minute-long feature, but was instead turned into a full-length movie at the demand of the fans. It was animated by Square Enix themselves, who of course also did the original Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within movie as Square Pictures, and was directed by FF regular, Tetsuya Nomura.It starts off where the end of the Final Fantasy VII game left off with Red XIII doing his Lion King impression, but then cuts back to 498 years later, which is 2 years after where we last left our heroes. Apparently, the Planet survived the attack of the Meteor, although the main city of Midgar was destroyed. So the survivors open up some cheap condos in the smaller town of Edge. Whiny emo-clown Cloud has become a delivery boy and adopted Marlene(Barret's kid)plus a boy named Denzel who is a dead ringer for Roxas from Kingdom Hearts. Cloud and Denzel are suffering from a new disease called Geostigma, but the not-so dead Rufus Shinra really has it bad. He tries to enlist Cloud to help him and some of the remaining badboy Turks from stopping a trio of biker dudes who are apparently looking for the head of Jenova's head. Jenova was the cause of all the monsters and darkness on the planet, and also Sephiroth's ""mother"". Kadaj, Yazoo, and Laz want to use Jenova's head to bring all the pieces of her together along with children infected by the Geostigma to cause the destruction of the planet. They gather all the children to Edge to try take down a large statue in the middle of the city which they're convinced is where Jenova's head is buried other, and then summon up a horde of demon dogs plus one mutha of a dragon. Cloud along with the entire old AVALANCHE crew show up and stop the monsters, then begin a long chase with Cloud trailing down Kadaj. Jenova's power tuns Kadaj into a resurrected Sephiroth, and he has an epic sword battle with Cloud. Cloud pulls some ""Knights Of The Round"" attack on Sephiroth which kills him(kinda), and Aerith's spirit makes some magical rain that cures everyone's Geostigma.This movie was a payoff for alot of the FF-anitics, although there were some complaints about inconstancies in the story, but were more or less resolved in the special Complete edition of the film when it was re-released on Blu-Ray. The first draft of the movie was supposed to be about Cloud with his newly adopted family that he and Tifa put together, but this was later used as the basis for the Reminiscence Of FFVII segment used on the DVD as a recap of the events from the game. The production involved making the characters look as realistic as possible, but still having weird anime hair and overstylized fashion sense. It was a serious step up from The Spirits Within and most of the FMV scenes from the games, even though you can tell that there's still something some lacking in the characters' facial expressions and movement, but still astounding animation. The dub for it though was really bland, where as the voice actors are good in their own rights, they really didn't give seem to give this any real effort. Plus, the dialogue for both the original Japanese script and English dub was terribly mismatched, and if you watch the deleted scenes you'll see that lots of rewrites were done with the dialogue to already completed footage. The DVD release features a short OVA titled FF: Last Order which is a full accounting of Sephiroth's turn to darkness, and his fight with Cloud and Zack, although this was 2D animated by Madhouse. The Blu-Ray release also has another short of On The Way To A Smile which is an original animation based on a novelle that comes with the Collector's Edition DVD that tells of Denzel's origins. The movie recieved a pretty big buzz when it was first released in America, although it was one of those cases like The Phantom Menace where after its initial reaction on the fan market, it changed somewhat after its presence had been examined a little further. Its one of those things where fans get all worked up for an continuation of something they loved, but when it comes out, they realize that its not all they had hoped for. The other major drawback is that the movie is totally useless to anyone who hasn't played the entire original game. However, this should be seen as a labor of love for fans of the game, and something they will treasure(until they get tired of it).",3,One more fantasy,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,4702,"['years', 'waiting', 'followup', 'original', 'groundbreaking', 'RPG', 'video', 'game', 'Square', 'Enix', 'original', 'Squaresoft', 'finally', 'got', 'doing', 'feature', 'animated', 'sequal', 'part', 'Compilation', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'series', 'also', 'included', 'two', 'video', 'game', 'prequals', 'game', 'sequal', 'anime', 'prequal', 'Even', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', '20', 'minute-long', 'feature', 'was', 'instead', 'turned', 'full-length', 'movie', 'demand', 'fans', 'was', 'animated', 'Square', 'Enix', 'who', 'course', 'also', 'did', 'original', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'movie', 'Square', 'Pictures', 'was', 'directed', 'FF', 'regular', 'Tetsuya', 'Nomura.It', 'where', 'end', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'game', 'left', 'off', 'Red', 'XIII', 'doing', 'Lion', 'King', 'impression', 'then', 'back', '498', 'years', 'later', '2', 'years', 'where', 'last', 'left', 'heroes', 'Apparently', 'Planet', 'survived', 'attack', 'Meteor', 'main', 'city', 'Midgar', 'was', 'destroyed', 'survivors', 'open', 'up', 'cheap', 'condos', 'smaller', 'town', 'Edge', 'Whiny', 'emo-clown', 'Cloud', 'become', 'delivery', 'boy', 'adopted', 'Marlene', 'Barret', 'kid', 'boy', 'named', 'Denzel', 'who', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Roxas', 'Kingdom', 'Hearts', 'Cloud', 'Denzel', 'are', 'suffering', 'new', 'disease', 'called', 'Geostigma', 'not-so', 'dead', 'Rufus', 'Shinra', 'really', 'bad', 'enlist', 'Cloud', 'help', 'remaining', 'badboy', 'Turks', 'stopping', 'trio', 'biker', 'dudes', 'who', 'are', 'apparently', 'looking', 'head', 'Jenova', 'head', 'Jenova', 'was', 'cause', 'monsters', 'darkness', 'planet', 'also', 'Sephiroth', 'mother', 'Kadaj', 'Yazoo', 'Laz', 'want', 'use', 'Jenova', 'head', 'bring', 'pieces', 'together', 'children', 'infected', 'Geostigma', 'cause', 'destruction', 'planet', 'gather', 'children', 'Edge', 'try', 'take', 'down', 'large', 'statue', 'middle', 'city', ""'re"", 'convinced', 'where', 'Jenova', 'head', 'buried', 'other', 'then', 'summon', 'up', 'horde', 'demon', 'dogs', 'one', 'mutha', 'dragon', 'Cloud', 'entire', 'old', 'AVALANCHE', 'crew', 'show', 'up', 'stop', 'monsters', 'then', 'begin', 'long', 'chase', 'Cloud', 'trailing', 'down', 'Kadaj', 'Jenova', 'power', 'tuns', 'Kadaj', 'resurrected', 'Sephiroth', 'epic', 'sword', 'battle', 'Cloud', 'Cloud', 'Knights', 'Round', 'attack', 'Sephiroth', 'kinda', 'Aerith', 'spirit', 'magical', 'rain', 'everyone', 'Geostigma.This', 'movie', 'was', 'payoff', 'alot', 'FF-anitics', 'were', 'complaints', 'inconstancies', 'story', 'were', 'more', 'less', 'resolved', 'special', 'Complete', 'edition', 'film', 'when', 'was', 're-released', 'Blu-Ray', 'first', 'draft', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Cloud', 'newly', 'adopted', 'family', 'Tifa', 'put', 'together', 'was', 'later', 'used', 'basis', 'Reminiscence', 'FFVII', 'segment', 'used', 'DVD', 'recap', 'events', 'game', 'production', 'involved', 'making', 'characters', 'look', 'as', 'realistic', 'possible', 'still', 'having', 'weird', 'anime', 'hair', 'overstylized', 'fashion', 'sense', 'was', 'serious', 'step', 'up', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'most', 'FMV', 'scenes', 'games', 'even', 'can', 'tell', 'still', 'something', 'lacking', 'characters', 'facial', 'expressions', 'movement', 'still', 'astounding', 'animation', 'dub', 'was', 'really', 'bland', 'where', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'own', 'rights', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'seem', 'give', 'real', 'effort', 'dialogue', 'original', 'Japanese', 'script', 'English', 'dub', 'was', 'terribly', 'mismatched', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'see', 'lots', 'rewrites', 'were', 'done', 'dialogue', 'already', 'completed', 'footage', 'DVD', 'release', 'short', 'OVA', 'titled', 'FF', 'Last', 'Order', 'full', 'accounting', 'Sephiroth', 'turn', 'darkness', 'fight', 'Cloud', 'Zack', 'was', '2D', 'animated', 'Madhouse', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'also', 'short', 'Way', 'A', 'Smile', 'original', 'animation', 'based', 'novelle', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'tells', 'Denzel', 'origins', 'movie', 'recieved', 'pretty', 'big', 'buzz', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'America', 'was', 'one', 'cases', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'where', 'initial', 'reaction', 'fan', 'market', 'changed', 'somewhat', 'presence', 'had', 'been', 'examined', 'little', 'further', 'one', 'things', 'where', 'fans', 'get', 'worked', 'up', 'continuation', 'something', 'loved', 'when', 'out', 'realize', 'not', 'had', 'hoped', 'other', 'major', 'drawback', 'movie', 'totally', 'useless', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'played', 'entire', 'original', 'game', 'However', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'labor', 'love', 'fans', 'game', 'something', 'will', 'treasure', 'get', 'tired']",N/A

The graphics of this movie are so wonderful that there is no word in the English language to desrcibe it.  You say, ""Are they really that good?""  The answer: yes.  Underneath the fancy graphics is a fairly decent storyline, however it doesn't quite live up to the game's storyline.  Of course the movie only has two hours to express it in and throws in lots of action as well.  Speaking of action... here's another place where this movie shines.  It's all so perfectly placed (the movements) that's it's like a violent dance... with big swords.  It's spaced somewhat strangely in between parts with fair amounts of dialogue and seems a bit strange... but you kind of don't care.  Seeing your favorite old characters in the way they shouyld have been displayed is also great.  Barret, Tifa, Red XIII, they all look incredible in the AC world and the voice acting, though criticized by others, seemed perfectly fine to me.  The music is incredible.  Orchestrated and it always fits the mood.  The return of ""One Winged Angel"" in an orches-rock set was wonderful as well.  I still can't get it out of my head.  I was in total awe at the end and I'm sure you would be, too.  A perfect film for action fans, animation fans, and Final Fantasy fans.

928827,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B000AMJG4Y,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[1, 3]","In all my time watching Director Cut movies, I've noticed there are two different types. The first is extra content that, sometimes without reason, someone thought would be too much for theatrical viewing. The other deals with extra story to it.This is the second. Another thing I've noticed in the past few years is how, if there's quite a load of content added, it usually adds up to, at most, 17 minutes. In this case, make that 26.Certain scenes that seemed to be missing a couple elements to make the scene whole get the extra bits and there's more comprehension and coherency. Other scenes seem to come out of nowhere, but make the story a little deeper anyway. Even the action itself gets a revamp and gets quicker and flashier, and, with the blu-ray upgrade, sharper. And I don't mean just the swords look sharper, either.Sound-wise, the soundtrack is more noticeable due to soundloss yet is more intertwined, it seems like, with the appropriate scenes (the piano goes great with the poignant/slow moments, guitars and synths completely compatible with the HIGH-octane moments, etc.), and, I could be mistaken, but it also sounds a bit more tweaked and remixed.From the start, I couldn't help but notice a few nods to the Bible, either, and I'm pretty sure no one meant to add them, but they're there anyway. Such as how the kids get infected first with GeoStigma, an echo of how the Bible says that whenever any kind of social evil happens, the kids are always the first to suffer for it. And the water that heals the sick? Brings to mind one of the nicknames for Jesus, Living Water. Not to mention how Kadaj sounds like nothing but a cultic teacher (albeit, one that's anti-environment). Oh, yes, and the moment when Kadaj becomes Sephiroth, on the DVD, it was exciting. On Blu-ray, it somehow gave me chills, possibly because the vocals are refined with the graphics details redefined. And that battle between the two? Much darker than I'd anticipated (not visually, but thematically) and one attack that loosened my jaw on the DVD completely dropped my jaw on Blu-ray. Extended and tweaked and enjoyed beyond belief.When all's said and done (and there are excellent little details that add to the big bag of mixed moments and expert Asian storytelling), it was worth checking out the special features, especially the anime titled On the Way To A Smile: Denzel.",5,"Flashier look, deeper story",1336003200,"05 3, 2012",2012,2373,"['time', 'watching', 'Director', 'Cut', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'types', 'first', 'extra', 'content', 'sometimes', 'reason', 'someone', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'theatrical', 'viewing', 'other', 'deals', 'extra', 'story', 'it.This', 'second', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'how', 'quite', 'load', 'content', 'added', 'usually', 'up', 'most', '17', 'minutes', 'case', 'make', '26.Certain', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'be', 'missing', 'couple', 'make', 'scene', 'whole', 'get', 'extra', 'bits', 'more', 'comprehension', 'coherency', 'Other', 'scenes', 'seem', 'come', 'nowhere', 'make', 'story', 'little', 'deeper', 'anyway', 'Even', 'action', 'revamp', 'quicker', 'flashier', 'blu-ray', 'upgrade', 'sharper', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'just', 'swords', 'look', 'sharper', 'either.Sound-wise', 'soundtrack', 'more', 'noticeable', 'due', 'soundloss', 'yet', 'more', 'intertwined', 'appropriate', 'scenes', 'piano', 'great', 'poignant/slow', 'moments', 'guitars', 'synths', 'completely', 'compatible', 'HIGH-octane', 'moments', 'etc', 'could', 'be', 'mistaken', 'also', 'bit', 'more', 'tweaked', 'start', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'few', 'nods', 'Bible', 'either', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'one', 'meant', 'add', ""'re"", 'anyway', 'Such', 'how', 'kids', 'get', 'infected', 'first', 'GeoStigma', 'echo', 'how', 'Bible', 'whenever', 'kind', 'social', 'evil', 'kids', 'are', 'always', 'first', 'suffer', 'water', 'sick', 'Brings', 'mind', 'one', 'nicknames', 'Jesus', 'Living', 'Water', 'Not', 'mention', 'how', 'Kadaj', 'nothing', 'cultic', 'teacher', 'one', 'anti-environment', 'Oh', 'yes', 'moment', 'when', 'Kadaj', 'Sephiroth', 'DVD', 'was', 'exciting', 'Blu-ray', 'somehow', 'gave', 'chills', 'possibly', 'vocals', 'are', 'refined', 'graphics', 'details', 'redefined', 'battle', 'two', 'Much', 'darker', ""'d"", 'anticipated', 'not', 'visually', 'thematically', 'one', 'attack', 'loosened', 'jaw', 'DVD', 'completely', 'dropped', 'jaw', 'Blu-ray', 'Extended', 'tweaked', 'enjoyed', 'said', 'done', 'are', 'excellent', 'little', 'details', 'add', 'big', 'bag', 'mixed', 'moments', 'expert', 'Asian', 'storytelling', 'was', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'special', 'features', 'especially', 'anime', 'titled', 'Way', 'A', 'Smile', 'Denzel']",N/A

No other game has made as much of an impact on me since that fateful day in 1997 when I picked it up.This movie will definitely mean more to fans than non-fans.  Much like how people will recommend reading a book over the movie based on the book (unless you absolutely hate reading) it will be hard to understand more of the subtle tones in the movie.  Like what the story with the Turks is or why Cloud continues to think of Aeris and Zack even if the movie tries to include some of the more significant parts of the backstory.  I would recommend playing the game and then watching the movie (though PS1 graphics haven't carried over well in the new age of the XBOX 360 and other next gen systems).  Understanding that this probably won't exactly be the easiest thing for casual watchers to do, I'll write more for the non-fans since all FFVII diehards will have no problem watching this movie.I'll end by saying that this is not a 5 star movie unless you have a complete grasp on the story.  The plot is relatively thin and unsatisfying (and possibly confusing) for anyone who hasn't caught up on the events 2 years prior to the time of this movie.  If you've seen Final Fantasy:  The Spirits Within, then you may not be too excited to see this movie.  FF: AC is much better at captivating the audience (even with the plot weakness).  It's bigger on action and oozes a sense of style that cannot be captured with live action.  Imagine the Matrix times 10.  Sure, some of the action is a bit over the top, but it brings more of a sense of awe that people can do CG like that than it does the sense of disbelief and disdain for that kind of action.In the end, I'd have to say that this movie is recommended for anyone who likes video games and/or action movies.  If you're expecting something deeper and philisophical and artsy (in the traditional sense), then you're better off passing on this and watching something else.",5,"Awe-inspiringly superb, but for non-fans...?",1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,2067,"['hard', 'write', 'review', 'movie', 'point', 'view', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'played', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'original', 'Playstation', 'other', 'game', 'made', 'much', 'impact', 'fateful', 'day', '1997', 'when', 'picked', 'up.This', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'mean', 'more', 'fans', 'non-fans', 'Much', 'how', 'people', 'will', 'recommend', 'reading', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'reading', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'understand', 'more', 'subtle', 'tones', 'movie', 'what', 'story', 'Turks', 'why', 'Cloud', 'think', 'Aeris', 'Zack', 'even', 'movie', 'include', 'more', 'significant', 'parts', 'backstory', 'would', 'recommend', 'playing', 'game', 'then', 'watching', 'movie', 'PS1', 'graphics', 'have', ""n't"", 'carried', 'over', 'well', 'new', 'age', 'XBOX', '360', 'other', 'next', 'gen', 'systems', 'Understanding', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'be', 'easiest', 'thing', 'casual', 'watchers', 'do', ""'ll"", 'write', 'more', 'non-fans', 'FFVII', 'diehards', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'watching', 'movie.I', ""'ll"", 'end', 'saying', 'not', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'have', 'complete', 'grasp', 'story', 'plot', 'relatively', 'thin', 'unsatisfying', 'possibly', 'confusing', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'caught', 'up', 'events', '2', 'years', 'prior', 'time', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'then', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'FF', 'AC', 'much', 'better', 'captivating', 'audience', 'even', 'plot', 'weakness', 'bigger', 'action', 'sense', 'style', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'captured', 'live', 'action', 'Imagine', 'Matrix', 'times', '10', 'Sure', 'action', 'bit', 'top', 'more', 'sense', 'awe', 'people', 'can', 'do', 'CG', 'sense', 'disbelief', 'disdain', 'kind', 'action.In', 'end', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'video', 'games', 'and/or', 'action', 'movies', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'something', 'deeper', 'philisophical', 'artsy', 'traditional', 'sense', 'then', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'passing', 'watching', 'something', 'else']",N/A

So it is with a great deal of sadness that I actually feel that this movie warrants such a low rating, but I couldn't rate it any higher based on its merits.I'll start with the strengths, and this should be the obvious one, and that is the graphic quality and animation. The detail on the character models especially is virtually unsurpassed, some truly impressive CGI on Square's part. Unfortunately, I still don't see it as perfect even in this regard, a lot of the scenery felt generic and the character movements often lacked an organic or natural feel to them.The music was pretty well done and the voice acting wasn't too bad for the most part although I honestly wouldn't rate many of the performances as great or truly stellar in either English or Japanese.The story is where it all really falls apart though, or rather the lack of a story. For starters it backpedals the story of the game itself, pretty much defeating the whole accomplishment of the game in a matter of minutes, recycling the same old villain and sticking Cloud back into his bubble of self-pity that he works his way out of through the course of the game.Now throw in a lot of meaningless action which revolves around fights that basically just drag on and on until someone losing is convenient for the story. The blows exchanged in the battles are pretty severe from start to finish but the only time it really shows anyone tired or losing is when the story requires it, otherwise it's just a meaningless and flashy exhibition of action. Pretty much every fight revolves around Cloud as well, the major characters from the game have disappointingly minor roles, the one real fight they are involved in their presence really makes no difference aside from providing Cloud with a ridiculous and cheesy boost.There's no real gravity to their situation, despite the intended evil they're facing no one really falls or dies or even gets injured. Nothing really carries the weight a story of this magnitude should and even the ridiculously over the top action only manages to further make it feel so artificial you can't take what little story there is seriously.As an exhibition of CG and action this movie is decent enough, but in all other areas it is either mediocre or fails outright. When you get other titles out there like Karas that actually manage a story and are visually stunning themselves there's little reason to purchase this aside from attachment to the game in which it is based. My bet is that Square was depending on that to make this cash-in of theirs, and why not?

Before its release, this was a big excitement for Final Fantasy fans at the time, but the result was a huge disappointment. To be honest, if you think about it, it wasn't actually a Final Fantasy film. Sure it had great CGI throughout but the story lead to nothing but a so-so, pointless sci-fi.Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, however, is a much greater achievement for a Final Fantasy film. The story takes place two years after the events of Final Fantasy VII on the Playstation. The ruins of Midgar stand as a testament to the sacrifices made in order to bring peace. The world faces a new menace. A mysterious disease known as Geostigma is spreading through the children around Midgar. Three new enemies, Kadaj, Yazoo and Loz, intend to start another reunion: to revive Sephiroth and unleash a total destruction.Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is an action packed fantasy experience and the action is spectacular, with probably some of the best battles I've ever seen in a movie, I couldn't take my eyes off it for a second. The animation is superb, while taking the characters from a video game into a film of CGI has been done exceedingly well. And the CGI visuals itself, throughout, are quite simply beautiful, containing absolutely breathtaking scenery. And also as a great fan of the Final Fantasy soundtrack, Advent Children really lived up to the highest standards. Really gets you into the Final Fantasy atmosphere, bringing back old memories of the FFVII experience.Another thing id like to mention is that, ""is this just for the fans?"" Well it definitely will be more respected by them and understanding.. But you cant actually say that this is a fans film only. Think about it....This is a top-notch entertaining 'film', not a turn-based RPG. Non-FF fans should at least check it out. Even though this is a sequel to something non-FF fans may not have experienced, but there is definetly something here that you will find deeply impressive.Within a beautiful world of Final Fantasy through CGI, containing absolutely stunning scenes of sword battles, magical scenery and the stunning event of Behemoth-Sin, this was an incredibly  magnificent Final Fantasy experience throughout, and without a doubt one of THE greatest animated movies I have ever seen.

You see the usual anime shenanigans (people making impossible jumps etc.) however, there is an explanation of how it done in this story.Advent Children is the last in the series (following Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core, and Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus).  However, Advent Children is the only one in the game series made into a movie.  It might be nice if Takahiro Sakurai did the other three games as well, since their are references back to events that took place before the movie.It is the story of Cloud Strife, after things have fallen apart on his world.

A lot of them seemed to come out of nowhere for no particular reason in the middle of the movie, but we just accepted it and enjoyed it for what it was.

928853,A17KMHCEI7AI56,B000AMJG4Y,"L. J Lewis ""Miss Amii""","[0, 7]","Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is the first in wave of brand new Final Fantasy VII related sequels called The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII Project. I say its Square-Enix's attempt at milking the cash-cow that is their first blockbuster game until its poor utter bleeds. This movie is pure fan gratification for the people that remain in love with game even though it is quickly approaching its tenth year anniversary. Granted, its not even good fan gratification.I'll preface why I think Advent Children is a poor tribute to hard-core fans, casual fans, and newcomers alike, by stating my game credentials. Final Fantasy VII annoyed me. It was a good game. I liked it when it came out, but I place it in the middle-lower end of series' quality spectrum. The part that annoys me is that for the last ten years, I've had to listen to the Final Fantasy VII fanboys, most of which have never really played an RPG before or after this one, blow the game completely out of proportion. Now, thanks to this movie, I'm sure this will continue for ten more years since this brainless, empty little affair is getting such high praise.Final Fantasy newcomers, avoid this movie, because what little of the plot makes sense only makes sense if you have played the game. The DVD has a retrospective from the game that is meant to help you out, but it is about twenty-minutes of still screen-shots from the game and it doesn't really cover much other than a few key scenes. It's pretty to look at, but it isn't pretty enough to find yourself awash in two hours worth of dreck.Now onto why Advent Children is a poor tribute for all the fans, casual and hard-core alike. For years, those fans have been begging Square-Enix to remake the game with state-of-the-art technology because the blocky 3D graphics of the early playstation days are really looking ugly. That is about the only thing Advent Children does: it looks pretty. Character models are gorgeous and as close to photorealistic as I've ever seen. When the camera isn't zipping around during fight scenes and people aren't doing ridiculous acrobatic combat, its easy to forget that everything you see is all computer generated. When it shifts into its numerous fight scenes, the audience is treated to frantic and cool-looking battles, at least in the first quarter of the movie. As the film approaches its climax, the combat becomes more and more ridiculous. People jump higher than superman. Two men engage in a fifteen minute sword fight while airborne the entire time. A motorcycle chase doesn't even try to adhere to the laws of physics. It becomes too much. Which brings me to my first point. The overall style of this movie is more suited to a game like Devil May Cry than any of the Final Fantasy series. I'll honestly say that if combat in the movie resembled the way it looks in the game, it would have been lame, but then again I ever imagined Cloud Strife as having the same moves as Neo from the Matrix.Point number Two is: The plot is a mess and the characterization is poor. This thing is so amateurishly written its sad, considering the plot/character progression is what so many people adored about the game. First, you must forget that misanthropic ending that implied that saving the world caused the extinction of the humans. In Advent Children, everyone is alive, but not so well. A strange sickness is spreading throughout the population called Geo-Stigma. Three white-haired men show up looking for the head of Jenova. It's up the heroes of Final Fantasy VII to stop their evil plot, but main character Cloud Strife is too busy being a sad little emo-kid who feels useless and refuses to fight. Cloud spends most of the movie moping about over issues I thought he had already resolved in the game, which gives the other characters time to make cameo appearances. Everyone outside of Cloud feels extraneous in this movie. Being that it is so Cloud-centric, its Surprising that Cloud doesn't have the best scenes. The most amusing and enjoyable scenes belong to the characters affiliated with the Shinra Corporation and they weren't even playable characters in the game. Everything culminates to a climax in which the dead villain Sephiroth comes back from the dead for one last duel with Cloud. I wonder what preteen fan fiction writer Square Enix found to write this plot, because that is exactly what it amounts to.To be honest, I don't know what I was expecting from this movie. I think I was at least hoping not to dislike it, but that's exactly what happened. The idea of watching this a second time is almost unbearable. If this is a taste of future videogames from Square will look like, we are lucky in did, but we all need to hope that Square keeps their future endeavors in the realm of videogames.It's not easy to create something that retains such a strong following a decade after its release. Final Fantasy VII fans deserved better after a decade of support",2,A Dazzling Spectacle With Zero Substance,1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,4944,"['Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'Advent', 'Children',

928856,A254QJ5BTEUH85,B000AMJG4Y,Magus,"[1, 1]","This movie was outstanding. It takes place a little after Final Fantasy 7, where the game ends. I'm glad this movie came out because it was meant to put a conclusion to the game. If you've played and beat the game it leaves some stuff in question. After I beat it I wanted to know more about what happend to the characters, well this answers that.We here in the beginning of the movie a battle going on in crater between the Turks, and 3 unknown young men. Next we see Cloud driving a motor bike, he's now a deliverer. The same unknown 3 reveal themselves and attack Cloud on the way. Cloud meets up with a few of the Turks and someone who I won't mention that was from the FF7 game. Clould learns a little about the 3 from them, the main leader of the 3 is called Kadaj. Cloud is asked to help stop them for everyones sake.Later we learn that their true intention, is to find the one they call Mother, quite a lot through the whole movie. The one who they call Mother. The first former comrade and child hood friend Tifa is the first one Cloud meets again. Tifa too has some trouble with Kadaj's group. There are other appearences by Cloud's former party members helping out.Cloud not only contends with Kadaj but also his own guilt still about what happend to Aeris in the game. So he has his own inner battle going on at the same time. The movie makes the main character Cloud even more interesting in this way. The story may seem somewhat short, but the game was close to 70 hours, with many mini-quests along the way, not just battling Sephiroth, but many monsters, and Shinra's Empire. This of course will seem like a much story.The grahpics of the movie are superb. They look like the game characters, the design of them has been redone though, they are more real types. Not as anime looking as the game characters looked. The environments of the city, to the rain effects really set the mood. A fantastic battle scene towards the end with a well known FF monster was terrific, and my favorite battle. There will be lots of battles in this movie. Some people felt they had to many battles, I felt it was just right.There were enough story points in the movie to tell everything they had to. Also I'll mention again this is only a 2 hour movie here. They had a lot of time to put out focus on all the characters, including a lot on Shinra. Not much of Shinra as an evil force here, lot's more on Kadaj and company. And there was alot of action in the game too remember.I've watched the Japanese and the Dubbed. I like them both, from what some people were saying I was expecting the worst from the dubbed. The voices fit well, I did not feel the need to have to switch to Japanese again, since I saw that first already.That's about it.

Most believe that it is further proof that the world has rejected humanity.  Cloud Strife, the conflicted hero of the original game has chosen to live a solitary life, unwilling to take action because of his part in the tragic events of the game.  But an attack as he returns to Midgard, and pressure from such disparate folks as Tifa Lockhart and Rufus Shinra, begins to draw him out of his shell.  Three brothers Kadaj, Yazoo, and Loz are searching for 'mother,' the remains of Jenova, the alien life form that nearly destroyed the planet, in order to resurrect Sephiroth.  When they kidnap the children of Midgard to further their aims, Cloud goes into action.  Still fighting his own internal battles the ex-SOLDIER pitches in with a vengeance, sensing that this is his last opportunity for healing.That, and about an hour of running battles is the plot of the film.  More than enough, by the way, to give every Final Fantasy fan in the universe a hundred minutes of fun, thrills, and even a few carefully hidden tears.  I would never have expected that a CGI recreation of what was one of the best of the games to be even better than the game it was modeled upon.  Directors Tetsuya Nomura and Takeshi Nozue are geniuses, plain and simple.  The graphics are pure Final Fantasy, but rather than push for hyper-detailed style that CGI often uses, the film maintains a slightly soft focus and pays great care to the naturalness and expressiveness of the characters.  Except when they are leaping and racing about during fights.  In the latter case prepare yourself from some truly delightful choreography.  So what, after all, if Cloud gets boosted a couple thousand feet in the air in a blazing example of teamwork, it's great to watch him take a the monster apart.A big surprise is the acting.  Both the Japanese version and the English dubbing are excellent.  I experienced no disconnect whatever between what I expected the characters to sound like and what they did sound like.  This, coupled with the fluid animation, creates an unusual level of realism.  The music was 'good enough' but not up to the par of the rest of the production.  For an interesting insight in how far animation has come take a look at the excerpts from the original game.  FF VII was the first games to start setting the bar for console games, but there is still a long way to go before FF X or the soon to be released FF XII.  Yet it's impossible to deny the playability of the game itsel, and this film proves that even an old story can wear new clothes.",5,"""Sadness was the price to see it end""",1159056000,"09 24, 2006",2006,2687,"['Set', 'two', 'years', 'conclusion', 'FF', 'VII', 'console', 'game', 'story', 'up', 'when', 'new', 'disease', 'Geostigma', 'be', 'infecting', 'world', 'Most', 'believe', 'further', 'proof', 'world', 'rejected', 'humanity', 'Cloud', 'Strife', 'conflicted', 'hero', 'original', 'game', 'chosen', 'live', 'solitary', 'life', 'unwilling', 'take', 'action', 'part', 'tragic', 'events', 'game', 'attack', 'Midgard', 'pressure', 'such', 'disparate', 'folks', 'Tifa', 'Lockhart', 'Rufus', 'Shinra', 'draw', 'shell', 'Three', 'brothers', 'Kadaj', 'Yazoo', 'Loz', 'are', 'searching', ""'mother"", 'remains', 'Jenova', 'alien', 'life', 'form', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'planet', 'order', 'resurrect', 'Sephiroth', 'When', 'kidnap', 'children', 'Midgard', 'further', 'aims', 'Cloud', 'action', 'Still', 'fighting', 'own', 'internal', 'ex-SOLDIER', 'pitches', 'vengeance', 'sensing', 'last', 'opportunity', 'healing.That', 'hour', 'running', 'battles', 'plot', 'film', 'More', 'enough', 'way', 'give', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'fan', 'universe', 'hundred', 'minutes', 'fun', 'thrills', 'even', 'few', 'carefully', 'hidden', 'tears', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'expected', 'CGI', 'recreation', 'what', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'games', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'game', 'was', 'modeled', 'upon', 'Directors', 'Tetsuya', 'Nomura', 'Takeshi', 'Nozue', 'are', 'geniuses', 'plain', 'simple', 'graphics', 'are', 'pure', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'rather', 'push', 'hyper-detailed', 'style', 'CGI', 'often', 'film', 'slightly', 'soft', 'focus', 'great', 'care', 'naturalness', 'expressiveness', 'characters', 'when', 'are', 'leaping', 'racing', 'fights', 'latter', 'case', 'prepare', 'truly', 'delightful', 'choreography', 'what', 'Cloud', 'boosted', 'couple', 'thousand', 'feet', 'air', 'blazing', 'example', 'teamwork', 'great', 'watch', 'take', 'monster', 'apart.A', 'big', 'surprise', 'acting', 'Japanese', 'version', 'English', 'dubbing', 'are', 'excellent', 'experienced', 'disconnect', 'whatever', 'what', 'expected', 'characters', 'sound', 'what', 'did', 'sound', 'coupled', 'fluid', 'animation', 'unusual', 'level', 'realism', 'music', 'was', ""'good"", 'enough', 'not', 'par', 'rest', 'production', 'interesting', 'insight', 'how', 'far', 'animation', 'come', 'take', 'look', 'excerpts', 'original', 'game', 'FF', 'VII', 'was', 'first', 'games', 'start', 'setting', 'bar', 'console', 'games', 'still', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'FF', 'X', 'soon', 'be', 'released', 'FF', 'XII', 'impossible', 'deny', 'playability', 'game', 'itsel', 'film', 'even', 'old', 'story', 'can', 'wear', 'new', 'clothes']",N/A

It brings to mind how much they missuse the name so when i heard of Advent childeren i figured that it would be a train wreck just like most of final fantasy side projects that are not video games. Yet as i continued watching this movie it just seemed to be pointing out the characters real easy not to mention i had already played thru the whole game. For those who haven't played the video game mostly likely wont understand what's going on and will complain about character development but for those who actually were paying attention the final fantasy 7 storyline and caught the situation you should feel very much informed on the situation the characters were in. Anyways Bottom line i loved this movie i was watching it with some friends that had never played the game before and they seemed to have loved to the even though they werent aquainted with the characters the way i was. The music was a tiny bit low unlike ff7's original sountrack but it added the new feel in the movie so there was nothing really to complain on this movie in my opinion except. If they would've tried this hard in their last project's like: FF: spirit's within, FF: Unlimited, and FF: Legend of the Crystals they would no doubt had four succesful projects instead of just one.

928868,A3HSSS8C4GHMAZ,B000AMJG4Y,Mr. Gareth G. Bull,"[9, 11]","Just Brings Back MemoriesThe most you'll enjoy this film is having invested a month of your life to the game. Then at best it may stir up old memories, your favourite characters, the fantastic scores of music, and then you'll feel warm inside. Then again, you could always just play the game.The MusicAs with alot of japanese movies they like their electric guitars. So for them to make something old and familiar (the music) sound fresh and more lively they rock it all up with electric guitars which loses its 'fresh' appeal within a minute or two. I'd go with the full blown orchestra every time, with a little less lead guitar pushing all the original music out of the frame. It would have been a welcomed surprize if there was a lead acoutic instrument and harps are always nice.Plot and CharactersBecause of what fans already know, there is little character development. This wouldn't matter so much, apart from the fact that there's very little emotion in the whole film to add to character. No one fears for Clouds life in the final battle, no one sheds one tear of worry. Maybe its becuase they all know who won the fight last time so why bother worry.Becuase of the pace of the story all the characters appear in the film for a fight. The closest you see them all bond is when each character (yup everyone) gives Cloud a foot-boost to chase a Creature that can fly. There's very little dialogue between them. I would have loved for the characters to have human problems the viewer could relate to and then emphasise with but there are none, unless you have a super rear case of geo-stigma.Humour?The only humour element in the whole of the film is acted out by the two Turks in suits. This is screwball tomfoolery comedy at best, hitting each other by mistake etc and nothing more. Its funny the first time. Personally I also thought the turks were the coolest bunch of cats in the whole of FFVII and so I wasn't happy to see these guys turned into Abbot and Castelo, albeit a very cool looking Abbot and Castelo.The Directors VisionThe film was made to appear well... not realIf the creators focused on making a proper movie with real life sensibilities I would have enjoyed the film more. Then again they did say (in the extras) they wanted to make a film that looked like a game not real life. This in turn meant people could jump... (they made their own rules) well you could almost call it flying... all over the place. But then when someone would slip over any edge of some tall structure, about to fall to their demise, the ability to jump/fly is lost and well down they fall.The plot was a message being left for Cloud and him reciveing it at the end of the film (from the directors mouth). Lots of fights are crammed in the middle of the plot.

928870,A2LEHZ6KNQFRV5,B000AMJG4Y,Mr. X,"[3, 3]","This movie surpasses the hype, and infact, blows it far, far away.The only reason not to see this, is because if you're not an avid fan of Final Fantasy VII, and haven't played nor beaten it completely through, then you will NOT understand the storyline of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, at all.That set aside, this is a really...really...extremely...good movie. The plot is as follows (for those whom just don't understand it):The movie is about a disease called Geostigma in which a major portion of the movies setting town Edge, contracts. The movie (for the most part) is about Cloud (the movies hero) trying to rid Edge (not Midgar!) of Geostigma, and save the world from Kadaj, Yazoo, and Loz. Whom are three guys, whom look like Sephiroth...sorta. They're basically Sephiroth wannabes and or clones. Anyway, they're trying to bring about the second ""Reunion"" with the remains of Jenova, in which only players of the original FF7 game, will understand what are. But the basis of this second ""Reunion"" is to rebirth Sephiroth. An ex Soldier member, gone mad. He was the final boss of the FF7 game. And they're trying to bring him back. And that's pretty much it, right there. I'll sum it up in order, to be understood easier.-Edge has the Geostigma disease.-Yazoo, Loz, and Kadaj want to recarnate Sephiroth through a second Reunion using the remains of Jenova.-Cloud must stop the 3, prevent the return of Sephiroth, and cure Edge of Geostigma before the movies end. All while grieving over the loss of Aeris (a character whom died in the FF7 game).That's the plot. Yes, the movie DOES have a plot. It just isn't very aparent to those whom haven't played and beaten the game. But it DOES have a plot, and the plot is exactly what I just noted above.At any rate, the graphics in this movie are off the wall. They look extremely real and less ""created"" for a CGI movie, unlike the graphics of the previous CGI Final Fantasy film, ""Spirits Within."" The action is intense as well, and nothing is out of place, looks stupid, or seems like it was put in as filler. There are a few ""bullet time"" scenes in there, but those are absolutely necessary, and add to the thrill of the movie.Nothing about this movie really turned me off, nor made me wanna skip through parts, and that's saying ALOT about it. Considering the last Final Fantasy movie was absolutely HORRIBLE. I hated it. But Advent Children has become my current addiction.I don't know anything about the English dubbed version, as I haven't seen it yet. I only own the Japanese (with English subtitles) version of the DVD, which I just recently purchased. And Japanese-wise, the voice acters are AMAZING. Absolutely flawless. No one could've done better. The emotion put into everything vocally, really captures the suspense, and drama the movie wants you to feel.The overall look of the characters in Advent Children is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! The way the three Sephiroth clones look, is so stunning. You'd have to see it for yourself. Even the way they made Sephiroth himself look, is extremely detailed and captivating. But the best looking character (by far) in the movie, is Tifa.Then finally, the music is flawless. It was written by none other than the original composer of most ALL of Final Fantasy's music, Nobuo Uematsu. It's all mostly piano oriented (nothing taken right directly from the game itself, but piano re-constructions of the game's music) but very beautifully piano oriented music indeed. There's even a seriously WICKED remix of ""One Winged Angel"" (the song from the final battle with Sephiroth in the FF7 game) at the very end of the movie, that has been completely altered, lyrically. And has electric guitars, bass, and drums, added to it. It's like a METAL remix of the song. This one is to NOT be looked over. But yes, the music is possibly the 2nd MAIN reason to see this movie, other than the beautiful character design.Overall...there's absolutely no reason NOT to see this movie, unless you haven't played the game, and actually mind not understanding the movie. So if you haven't played the game, I suggest you do so before seeing this, or just skip it. In the end, I think this was a movie strictly meant for the fans alone whom would know what was going on. But who am I to complain? I understood it, and I was reading subtitles for 2 hours. Plus, i've beaten and understood the game. Which is a prime factor in seeing this movie.I highly suggest Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, but only if you're a hardcore fan and know the game like the back of your hand. Otherwise, you're not going to understand the movie that much. But if that doesn't bother you, and you're just looking to see an action packed beautiful CGI movie, then by all means, consider putting Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children on the top of your ""to see"" list.I give it a 5/5, it blew the hype away.The hype can't even touch how great this movie is.",5,Forget the hype...,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,4918,"['movie', 'hype', 'infact', 'far', 'far',

If you don't like videogames or have never played FFVII then I doubt you'll like this movie very much. I leant it to a friend who is a bigger movie buff than me(who loves some of the worst films of all-time) thinking he would at least appreciatte the action sequences and animation. He called it garbage, lol. I watched again after I leant it to him and the story really is disjointed at best if you know nothing of the game.That said, this version should have been the initial release. It's criminal how many vital scenes were cut and/or shortened. The effect of these scenes being editing for the US audience actually makes a somewhat large impact on the potential to understand the story. Now that FF: Crisis Core is out and we all know the origins of FFVII the scenes with flashes of Zack are needed even more. This is now a trilogy of events and small tidbits that need to be fleshed out in a two hour period. Much of the additional content is also extended battle sections that(in one case with Rude and Reno) actually explains how the scene gets from one point to another where the original version left a magnificient gap.The most important thing to realize with this, other than what I've said about not playing the game, is that it's a movie about a videogame guys. People ""flying around"" and ""surviving what no one on earth could"" doesn't matter. The laws of our world don't apply in the world of FFVII folks, sorry, so just let it go. I've seen so much worse things done in films that try to appear realistic and yet a movie about a game series gets slammed for doing things we couldn't in real life. That's why it's animated.As far as the actual movie goes...it's just jaw-dropping if you look at it in a way such as I do. I've come to love it more and more with each viewing and it's starting to grow on me even more as I write this. It is simply beautiful. The animation is the best you will see outside of Disney Pixar and the japanese crew/director really understand how to use camerawork to improve the feel and aesthetics of the scenes. So many times I find myself just looking at the hair on the characters heads and being impressed. The score is also somethign for everyone. It is so well done and reminds me of something like the first Star Wars movies in that it has that quality that adds to the overall tone and direction of the scenes. A great example is the final bout with Sephiroth. There is a part *SPOILER ALERT*(I guess) where the music starts to change tempo, Cloud enters a stance and prepares for what he knows is going be one heck of an attack on the part of Sephiroth and the Shin-ra headquarters starts to come down upon him, literally. The music then rushes in and I just can't explain the feeling you get watching it if you invest yourself in the experience.For anyone who has always wanted to watch this, but didn't want to buy it yet, this is the ultimate and finite version. For anyone who watched the original and disliked it due to the lack of coherence in the story I strongly urge you to reconsider and at least borrow/rent it and give it one more chance. I feel it's worth every penny and minute I spent waiting for it to come to the States.",5,The word Complete has never been so very important.,1246492800,"07 2, 2009",2009,3607,"['have', 'owned', 'American', 'itteration', 'movie', 'love', ""'m"", 'gigantic', 'fan', 'FFVII', 'movie', 'most', 'characters', 'feeling', 'story.This', 'movie', 'taken', 'much', 'flak', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'fully', 'understand', 'taken', 'perspective', 'one', 'working', 'knowledge', 'videogame', 'version', 'so', 'much', 'fix', 'many', 'issues', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'videogames', 'have', 'never', 'played', 'FFVII', 'then', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'leant', 'friend', 'who', 'bigger', 'movie', 'buff', 'who', 'worst', 'films', 'all-time', 'thinking', 'would', 'least', 'action', 'sequences', 'animation', 'called', 'garbage', 'lol', 'watched', 'again', 'leant', 'story', 'really', 'disjointed', 'best', 'know', 'nothing', 'game.That', 'said', 'version', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'initial', 'release', 'criminal', 'how', 'many', 'vital', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'and/or', 'shortened', 'effect', 'scenes', 'being', 'editing', 'US', 'audience', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'large', 'impact', 'potential', 'understand', 'story', 'Now', 'FF', 'Crisis', 'Core', 'out', 'know', 'origins', 'FFVII', 'scenes', 'flashes', 'Zack', 'are', 'needed', 'even', 'more', 'now', 'trilogy', 'events', 'small', 'tidbits', 'need', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'two', 'hour', 'period', 'Much', 'additional', 'content', 'also', 'extended', 'battle', 'sections', 'one', 'case', 'Rude', 'Reno', 'actually', 'how', 'scene', 'one', 'point', 'where', 'original', 'version', 'left', 'magnificient', 'gap.The', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'realize', 'other', 'what', ""'ve"", 'said', 'not', 'playing', 'game', 'movie', 'videogame', 'guys', 'People', 'flying', 'around', 'surviving', 'what', 'one', 'earth', 'could', ""n't"", 'matter', 'laws', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'apply', 'world', 'FFVII', 'folks', 'sorry', 'so', 'just', 'let', 'go', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'worse', 'things', 'done', 'films', 'try', 'appear', 'realistic', 'yet', 'movie', 'game', 'series', 'slammed', 'doing', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'real', 'life', 'why', 'animated.As', 'far', 'actual', 'movie', 'just', 'jaw-dropping', 'look', 'way', 'such', 'do', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'more', 'more', 'viewing', 'starting', 'grow', 'even', 'more', 'write', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'best', 'will', 'see', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'japanese', 'crew/director', 'really', 'understand', 'how', 'use', 'camerawork', 'improve', 'feel', 'aesthetics', 'scenes', 'So', 'many', 'times', 'find', 'just', 'looking', 'hair', 'characters', 'heads', 'being', 'impressed', 'score', 'also', 'somethign', 'everyone', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'something', 'first', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'quality', 'overall', 'tone', 'direction', 'scenes', 'great', 'example', 'final', 'bout', 'Sephiroth', 'part', '*SPOILER', 'ALERT*', 'guess', 'where', 'music', 'change', 'tempo', 'Cloud', 'stance', 'prepares', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'heck', 'attack', 'part', 'Sephiroth', 'Shin-ra', 'headquarters', 'come', 'down', 'literally', 'music', 'then', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'feeling', 'get', 'watching', 'invest', 'experience.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'always', 'wanted', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'yet', 'ultimate', 'finite', 'version', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'original', 'disliked', 'due', 'lack', 'coherence', 'story', 'strongly', 'urge', 'reconsider', 'least', 'borrow/rent', 'give', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'feel', 'worth', 'penny', 'minute', 'spent', 'waiting', 'come', 'States']",N/A
928879,A37G6UPLDGH81P,B000AMJG4Y,"Ookami ""daronin""","[57, 132]","Back in the summer of 2001, Hironobu Sakaguchi released the first movie to bear the final fantasy moniker.  It was a film that had a quality storyline, brilliant direction that segued from subtlety, to using scenes that involved symbolism in their imagery to communicate emotion, as well as scenes of subtlety and scenes of flat out action.  But it was also an animated film released to the western world, with preconceptions that all animated fare is for children.  It also lacked any real references to past final fantasy titles, so the video game crowd avoided it.  Video Game films also have a rather poor history so the general movie going audience avoided it.  Which left a rather small portion of the movie going audience that were open minded or adventurous enough to view this film.  Sadly, this film performed poorly at the box office.  The ramifications of this poor performance resulted in Hironobu Sakaguchi eventually leaving square to form his own company, and now Tetsuya Nomura throws in his cinematic attempt into the film making industry.  So how does Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children stack up?One would be correct in stating that Advent Children deftly avoids all the mistakes that Spirits Within Made.  Its marketing and advertising has been in full blitz for the past few years, making sure the gaming audience knows full well about this product.  It is also a direct continuation of Final Fantasy VII, the Final Fantasy game that while being slightly simpler and having a story of lesser mature impact then past Final Fantasy titles before it, managed to introduce the mainstream gaming audience to RPG's with its THEN groundbreaking cinema's and uncanny Hollywood direction.  So the target audience is getting a film that they can immediately identify with and access immediately, this is all well and good.  But while Advent Children succeeds where spirits within failed, it also retroactively stumbles where Spirits Within succeeded.Spirits within had a labyrinthine tale of faith, hope, meaning, loss.  It was a well told tale that had just enough substance too it to make you think if you bothered to try.  It also had stellar direction, and a deft hand at storytelling that rarely missed a beat or lead you down a path that didn't have meaning to the overall tale.  Advent Children on the other hand, feels like it was written by an eight year old.  The film starts out interestingly enough, with a disease ravaging the planet known as geostigma.  The story implies that geostigma is fatal, and remarkably painful.  This is where the storytelling and direction initially fall apart.  Rarely is geostigma shown to be horrid or frightening.  The most affecting scene would be the films main character, Cloud Strife, having a seizure in his arm before passing out in a peaceful looking slumber.  He is in no way debilitated by the disease, as the film shows him early on fighting with uncanny ability.  Nor is it ever shown to have any major symptoms.  A deft storyteller would attempt to make the audience feel the characters afflicted by showing gruesome deaths or other frightening ailments.  We never see any such signs, thus resulting in whatever emotional pathos we might have felt being rendered unfeelable.The film also makes many more storytelling missteps.  Cloud is also suffering from a sort of Survivors guilt, as in the original story of FFVII he saw his love interest murdered before his eyes, and feels it is his fault and wants forgiveness.  He mopes and pontificates throughout most of the film, and while I wont spoil how, the resolution of this inner conflict comes with a verbal exchange that lasts less then 15 seconds.  It feels as though both the script writer and director were both tired of this plot thread, and decided to dispose of it immediately rather then have it play out to any real conclusion.Sadly, the story devolves into the use of Deus Ex Machina for the resolution of its major crisis points conflicts, with the use of a spirit from one one FFVII's deceased characters showing up frequently towards the end, taking on solid form to help out in a battle, resurrecting a slain character, as well as treating injuries and tending to sick children in full physical form.  How a character that has been dead for two years do so much, I'm not sure.  The film starts off with simple spectral visitations, then loses control and has said character resolve all dramatic points to result in a happy ending instead of one with some dramatic meaning.Ive gone on length about the story, and Advent Children is a film that seems to pride itself on its action scenes.  These too are seemingly lacking any real care or thought.  The character of Tifa has an early scene where she battles one of the three new villains, in a contest of physical and martial ability.  This scene makes constant use of slow motion, and camera pans.  The action will constantly slow down as the two characters charge or prepare to deliver a blow, then speeds up to the point where the blow and several followups are all delivered in less then a seconds time.  The animation quality in this scene is atrocious, and feels more like a slide show interspersed with scenes that are played out in fast forward.  And whenever both combatants animate, its done in the fast forward sense, or is done with motion blurs.  The slow motion blurs imitate The matrix films use of bullet time, but they don't use it anywhere near as effectively.  The overall effect is ameteurish and silly looking.  And the scene itself has numerous moments where still shots of the characters move using the blur effect, which is as undescribably awful to watch as it is laughable.Following combat scenes are also similarly disjointed and bordering on nonsensical.  Cloud Runs along tree's at a vertical angle as if he is spiderman, and hovers in the air for a considerable passage of time while deflecting assaults from an attacker.  There are numerous influences in the film making, most notably from Hong Kong cinema such as Wuxia (Fantasy type martial arts films, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero would both be considered Wuxia) and John Woo's Hong Kong work are all referenced, but it is never imitated effectively, but rather it seems as though the director (Nomura be thy name) watched various trailers from some top ranked HK films and Japanese anime, and tried to emulate the brief moments of genious without any idea of the substance behind it.  There is a scene late in the film that unashamedly imitated Iron Monkey's final fight scene, with combatants leaping from structure to narrow structure, and catching companions who are in danger of falling and hurling them to safer footing or to a better attack position.  But where iron monkey used this dynamic sparingly, Advent Children takes things into the absurd with each character seemingly taking turns throwing and being thrown.Aurally the film is a mixed bag, I respect composer Uematsu as a composer, but he's done better.  This is mostly due to the fact that almost 1/3 of the tracks in AC are remixes from the game.  Nobuo Uematsu is a composer that has had his works performed in live symphonies, wasting such a talent by just using a large amount of remixes is a waste of his talents.  By and large the new works from Uematsu just do not stand out very much.  One gets the impression of a half hearted work ethic out of Uematsu this time around, which is understandable considering his having left square, and his work on AC was either due to a fat paycheque or contractual obligations.  There are a few instances of flash and his typical charisma, but they are few and far between.Seeing all the high ratings for Advent Children, one can only assume that people out there must really like the game of Final Fantasy VII, or be unfamiliar with much of Hong Kong Cinema, and easily impressed by the imitation of its flash, without the substance.  The story is trite and shallow, the dialogue is laughable and has a childs feel.  In one scene where a group of children are kidnapped, the character of Tifa (who is now clouds love interest) takes time out worrying about the fate of the children and nags cloud about why he doesn't respond to her phone calls, and why he spends so much time alone.  I had to replay the scene multiple times because not only is she nagging at him about everything under the sun, going on a mile a minute, but some of the dialogue was so trite I laughed at how silly the film was getting, when it was trying to be poignant and meaningful.I don't think Im asking too much for action scenes to have some semblance of direction, for animation to have a consistent quality to it, for the story to be able to have some semblance of depth and logic, Advent Children lacks any of this.  There are some moments of entertainment to be had, as the background characters of the Turks (think of an organized secret police of a large company) are amusing and have some great lines and scenes.  But they all come in too late, and do too little to save this disaster.  I've always found Tetsuya Nomura to be an inferior director and storyteller to Hironobu Sakaguchi, but his work in past video games easily surpasses his attempt to create a motion picture.  Advent Children is less a film and more of one mans Final Fantasy VII fanfiction brought to life.  I don't mind being the odd reviewer out by recommending this film be avoided at all costs.",1,"A storytelling black hole.

If you were a fan of the game, you'll be pleasentley suprised to see things like materia, limt breaks (omni-slash makes an appearance, insanely cool at that) and of course, summons (well, A, summon to be more specific, but it gets the job done).The story was actually pretty well done. I remember reading, ""... the geostigma is destroying the world..."" and thinking to myself,  cheesy... But, the guys over at Square-Enix manage to pull off a concept such as that without making it, well, suck, for lack of a better word. Rene and Rude are in it, and provide some quality comic relief. Every playable charcter from the game is in it, and they all have their unique personalities along with them for the ride. Overall, I found this to be a suprisingly delightful experience, and when it is released in the US, I'll happily part with twenty bucks for it.",5,Just finished it... amazing...,1140652800,"02 23, 2006",2006,1390,"['recently', 'watched', 'movie', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'Final', 'Fantasy', '7', 'fan', 'still', 'found', 'be', 'enjoyment', 'start', 'finish', ""'m"", 'manga', 'fan', 'reguradless', 'did', ""n't"", 'fast', 'forward', 'single', 'second', 'movie', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'jaw-dropping', 'graphics', 'are', 'things', 'watch', 'movie', 'few', 'changes', 'pants', 'hand', ""'re"", 'gon', 'need', 'em', 'when', 'see', 'graphics', ""'m"", 'computer', 'expert', 'graphics', 'as', 'far', 'computer', 'literacy', 'when', 'sort', 'field', 'were', 'fan', 'game', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleasentley', 'suprised', 'see', 'things', 'materia', 'limt', 'breaks', 'omni-slash', 'appearance', 'insanely', 'cool', 'course', 'summons', 'well', 'A', 'summon', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'job', 'done', '.The', 'story', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'remember', 'reading', 'geostigma', 'destroying', 'world', 'thinking', 'cheesy', 'guys', 'Square-Enix', 'manage', 'pull', 'off', 'concept', 'such', 'making', 'well', 'suck', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'Rene', 'Rude', 'are', 'provide', 'quality', 'comic', 'relief', 'Every', 'playable', 'charcter', 'game', 'have', 'unique', 'personalities', 'ride', 'Overall', 'found', 'be', 'suprisingly', 'delightful', 'experience', 'when', 'released', 'US', ""'ll"", 'happily', 'part', 'twenty', 'bucks']",N/A

928883,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B000AMJG4Y,P. Hardy,"[4, 15]","As usual with big budget CGI Animated movies from Japan in the forms of BOOTLEG - SELECTED THEATERS - COMPLETELY CGI - and - IMPORTS, the Japanese have once again beaten the second to last of their dead 'Final Fantasy VII' horse and conjured up the two year follow up of the 1997 Playstation game, ""Advent Children."" This movie suffers from the natural flaw that most films of this format from Japan suffer; Trying to be too philosophized within itself when there's not that much complexity within this evergoing series of video games and mini movies that seems to suffer from the George Lucas syndrome. In all reality its as straight forward as ""APPLESEED"" is, only its not as interesting. Hardly after a year has past, Advent Children has finally arrived on U.S. borders in the form of its official DVD release. While the storyline is still pretty nonexistent the official subtitle translation and English dub somehow made the movie more enjoyable and a lot easier to understand compared to a fan translation.Fan boys and rabid fangirls will ignore the fact that Advent Children has no plausible storyline and simply revel in the presence of the major, minor and cameo characters just because it tickles them to them again. In truth the movie could be called a sort of nostalgia piece of sorts for them. Newcomers are better off just playing the games past VII. Before watching the movie, I would suggest watching the FFVII Digest that covers all the important details in the video game. Its a major help to those who ever played or bothered finishing the game, plus it'll help you understand the movie a lot more. While I watched this I tried hard not to laugh at the little sprite characters running on the screen and the low grade animation used in the cut scenes. The only downside is that the subtitles move a tad bit quickly when your attempting to read the length dialogue.""[My sister unwittingly bought a copy of the movie (noting that I simply love editing action scenes with music I own). I was never bothered by the fact that Japanese with English subtitles was the only choice on the DVD, I watched the movie. I began to realize that none of the dialogue was making a bit of sense. In my honest opinion, I was confused through the entire movie until watching it a second time. If anything, its dialogue was trying to be too poetic and again, too philosophized when it explains in a child's voice what went down in the video game. Thus the explanation and drama of the story was lost on me. However, I did gather this much].""[Disc One: The movie]:The planet has begun healing itself from the devastating attack of the meteor (Jenova). A strange disease known as ""Geo-Stigma"" has arisen in its wake. As far as the people know there is no obvious cure, and children seem to be at greater risk. Cloud Strife, who is also infected with the disease, has secluded himself from the world, haunted by the demons of his past. Beforehand he established a delivery service with Tifa and once lived in the bar. Tifa's bar [Seventh Heaven] is now an orphanage for the infected children where she and Cloud have taken care of the children before his absence. Marlene Wallace, Barrett's adopted daughter, is entrusted to the care of Tifa. With them is a boy named Denzel, who Cloud, Tifa, and Marlene have taken in as their own. Elsewhere three villainous pretty boys [Clones of Sephiorth of an unexplained origin], Kadaj (the jubilant seeming and twisted ringleader), Loz (the big strong guy who cries), and Yazoo (similar to Kadaj in appearance with the exception of longer hair, more acrobatic and straight forward with killing) plans to revive Sephiroth or 'mother' as they have come to call him. They attack Cloud --or ""Bother/traitor""-- under the assumption that he has what their looking for. From there proceed to kidnap all the children from Tifa's bar turned orphanage under the false pretense that they will cure them of their illness. Cloud is practically forced out of his seclusion, feeling responsible somehow but still thinks himself unable to help others he cares for.The storyline is basically as straight forward as that. ADVENT may rival SPIRITS WITHIN in the animation department but so far FF:TSW has the better storyline, inspite of its departure from the game. As mentioned above, many of the characters from the game make cameo appearances throughout the movie, in Sailor Moon and Power Ranger styled appearances. They come just when a dangerous situation looks bleak and stand together in a dramatic pose before rushing off into the fray. All of them ready to back Cloud Strife in his battle again the three brothers and their plan to revive their original counterpart. The movie is more action than story. It impresses you with over the top action scenes that are fast and furious, equally dazzling but a bit clunky in most places. It was obvious from the start that ENIX was inspired by various Hong Kong and Jet Li films. Maybe even Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. To my delight most of the battles are indeed eye catching and thrilling to watch. With the exception of the Tifa vs. Loz battle.Tthe trailer it made the battle look very cool. It ended up being erratic and choppy at best. The score chosen for the battle was a let down as well. I was expecting this fight to be second best at least. Of course when the action stops, the movie lags on until it begins again. Thus creating a sense of jet-lag, apparent in movies like 'Soldier' and the 'Harry potter' series to name a couple.The obvious humor of the movie was not so lost on me like I had originally thought; The characters Reno and Rude are excellent comic relief but do turn out to be the more likable secondary male characters. I did laugh when Loz's ringtone was the silly victory song played during the game. Reno getting locked out his own building was a riot. Scenes concerning Cloud and Kadaj are bearable at best. A majority of the time you'll be trying to figure out what's going on within the erratic-blipping flashbacks or the close ups on Kadaj's eyes in certain scenes. Most of the scenes with Cloud will confuse you as you try to figure out whether if he's dreaming, or having flashbacks or if he's in the present. This is most obvious when a white screen appears and his talking to the late Aerith or is unconscious. Its rather confusing to those who don't have speed-vision.SQUARE ENIX shows that they've recovered from their self-induced Bankruptcy from their first attempt at an CGI movie via ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within,"" by providing their viewers with beautiful CGI animation that does surpass its predecessor on many levels. They paid a lot of attention to the surrounding backgrounds and character models in the film. The clothes look like clothing and actually movie and shift like the material it imitates. The hair, faces, skin features, eye animation is more life like and realistic while still maintaining the GCI look. Its actually pretty, but has its problems if you look hard enough. The motion capture is better than it was in ""Spirits Within"" - capturing movement with flawless ease, thus further awing the viewer. However, there are still problems in terms of running and reaction motion. I also noticed a few problems with the motorcycles; They can be clunky sometimes. Probably because they defies logical limits of reality.The score by Uematsu Nobuo and the Black Mages plays very little like video game themed music, though it carries that sort of demeanor. Instead of looping music of course, the score for FFVII:AC constructed like a normal lengthy and charismatic Japanese score. Most of the score didn't go so well with most scenes in the film (Loz vs. Tifa, Cloud vs. Kadaj's gang). I wasn't all too surprised that amateur guitar rock managed to find its way into the background during the heat of combat, ultimately making me want to clobber Nobuo and the Black Mages. Its less than impressive and while it does offer good moments now and then, it doesn't deliver like it should've. The revamped Sephiroth theme 'Advent: One Winged Angel' made me chortle because it sounded like something out a b-horror movie when paused to make the 'phsyco stabbing' sound effect. Once again the rock invades the theme half of way through the song, turning out to blend well with the roaring orchestrated symphony. The lyrical Latain vocals did impress me as well.The translation of Japanese in the subtitles compared to the BOOTLEG subtitled version of ADVENT CHILDREN my sister got me, is so much better in terms of understanding the very little story, while maintaining the incoherency of Japanese dailouge. There are eight subtitle formats to choose from with English and Japanese audio only. I'm basically neutral when it comes to Japanese dubs in anything concerning Japanese cartoons and films. Mostly because with films like these, they usually get horrible English dub treatment (see: Appleseed). But to my surprise, the English Dub is brilliantly transferred on this CGI film like silk on skin. It practically rivals SPIRITS to a major T. It also brings to light how little dialogue there is in the entire movie itself. The voice actors really put their all into the characters -- with the exception of some hiccups in most characters (Loz for instance) --- and give truly convincing performances. While its a bit strange at first to watch the movie in English -- the mouths are clearly matched for Japanese -- it steadily becomes less eerie. With familiar (and not so familiar) English casts this should please anyone who gets a bit tired of reading subtitles.While her role is relatively small, Mena Suvari plays the late Arieth well, captuiring the saint like personality. Christy Carlson Romano (Kim Possible/Even Stevens) reprises her role as Yuffie from ""KINGDOM HEARTS,"" and gives what charm she can to a character very few lines. Crispin Freeman (Wolf's Rain) and Quinton Flynn as the Turks Rude and Reno, were amazing actors for the characters; They were good during the comedic moments too. Former(?) Soap Opera star, Steve Burton's (whom I almost mistook as Mark Hildreth) voice is the embodiment of Cloud's character in the movie. His broody voice matches the emotions of character so well, its easily my favorite voice actor in the film (""Well, I'm gonna try,""). Steve Blum gives an excellent performance as a deep voiced and wise Vincent Valentine, whose plight seems to be to the lack of a cell phone. Beau Billingslea whom I know from Orgemon of ""Digimon: Digital Monsters,"" was an excellent choice for Barret Wallace. His gruff voice, however, did nothing to fix the silly expressions they gave the tough man.Much like Mena Suvari, Rachael Leigh Cook (She's all that) as Tifa ---Cloud's potential love interest and caretaker of the children in 7TH Heaven--- was an excellent choice on SQUARE's part. Her voice lends a sort of human charm Tifa lacks in the Japanese language. She could work on the emotional range of her voice though. The child(?) voice actors, Benjamin Bryan and Grace Rolek as Denzel and Marlene Wallace amazing. Defiantly on par with Rachel Hirschfeld ---Antia King--- in ROD: THE TV. While many did not like Rolek's voice for Marlene I thought it went well the character and presented her childhood just well as the Japanese Va did. Bryan wasn't heard much through the film due to his character'd short time of the screen, but he does excellently when his voice can be heard. Especially when Denzel swears, no matter how silly it sounded. Steve Staley - (Kadaj), Fred Tatasciore - (Loz), and Dave Wittenberg (Yazoo) were practically identical matches for their Japanese counterparts; Especially in the grunting department. However, Fred Tatasciore was probably the weakest out of the three of them.His characterization made Loz sound kind of lame and wimpy (""Meanie!""). Not at all like the tough guy presented on the screen. Dave Wittenberg had his weak moments as well, during Yazoo's fight with Reno. Chris Edgerly as the toothpick chewing Cid Highwind did well with what few lines he had; His Texan accent for character was quirky and something that made you laugh in a good way. Rick Gomez as Cloud's deceased friend Zack was also an excellent match for the character's short time on film. Lastly George Newbern (Wolf's Rain) as Cloud's arch nemesis, Sephiroth, was at first a big surprise. His voice matched the pale and menacing appearance of the villain so well it made me grin just listening to him. Once you watch the Cloud vs. Sephiroth scene a couple more times though, you begin to notice that Newbern's voice is just a tad bit on the soft side to be all that villainous. It doesn't detract from the character too much though. Other actors (namely Jamieson Price as the disembodied voice of Reeve Tuesti) that lend their voices to the film are as equally good as the core VAs, if not better.[DISC TWO]:Disc two is all that a Special feature's junkie could ever hope for. Its jam packed with more previews and scene segments for ADVENT CHILDREN's arrival than ""making of's."" That segment is barely over the 60 minute mark at best. Subtitles are provided for the trailers and interviews with the creators in Japanese only, which was nice. If there's anything more annoying its listening to translators over the Japanese being spoken. Fans will obviously compared the US release to the Japanese release due to the anime ""Final Fantasy VII: The Last Order"" was not added to the special features disc. I particularly don't care to watch another thing chronicling events during, between, or after the video game. I'd just go nuts and crack from so much FFVII exposure!1): Deleted Scenes - This section is composed of eleven half-completed deleted scenes. Most of which are things that deserved to be cut from the movie -- Cloud and Sephiroth's halfhearted conversations during their epic fight---. The others, however, are camera angles that weren't used or included in the film that were used in the trailers. Which in and of itself is probably not a totally downfall but would've probably helped the flow of the battles just a little more. Overall its a major disappointment for those who thought the deleted scenes would hold some kind of substance or importance they cut out of the movie. - 3/52): The advanced screening - This bunch of scenes collected into a twenty minute screening was shown when AC was first revealed to the public back in 2004. Its not much different from watching the film itself, maybe its put together a little better than movie in some cases but shows the same flaws (mostly with the Tifa/Cloud flashback). The end is one glorified action montage which was cool but it ended like all the other trailers shown on the DVD. - 4/53): Advent Children Trailers - These were a lot of fun to watch! Collected from various game conventions (or magazines freebie discs) from around the world (or just the USA), the first several AC trailers showcase the first bouts of animation for the film and how it improved as the time of its release drew near. The final two trailers were merely scenes from the final product and were put together much better. Out of all of the trailers though, the Festa Jump (2004/05) trailers had to be the most overly flamboyant and cheesy. -3/54): Making Of: Advent Children - This little segment was probably the best out of the entire special features on the DVD. It showcased various interviews with most of the core people who had a hand in creating Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. They explained their objectives and ideals for the films without revealing too much about the CGI graphics like most Special Feature DVDs would. Thus the movie will still hold some kind of awe factor if you watch again. One of the shockers for me is that, the director reveals that the scenario writer wrote a twenty minute script, which kinda explains why AC suffers so many flaws. Nevertheless, this is a must watch segment for fans. - 4/55): FFVII: Video game sneak-peaks - Only a FFVII fan could truly be delighted in this collection of trailers for this video game. The first one It showcases ShinRA company characters (Reno and Rude, etc.), entitled ""Before Crisis."" The second, ""Crisis Core,"" details the demise of Zack and Cloud's manipulation during Sephiroth's turn to the dark side. To comment the art used in the anime scenes shown in the trailers, its not the best. The art is more or less the kind  you'd find in one of those low budget adult anime movies (the characters have unnaturally tall and skinny drawn frames. Or their top or bottom lips seemed to be dowsed with lip-liner or lipstick) and what not. The third is a trailer for a PS2 video game dedicated completely to mysterious Vincent Valentine, entitled ""Dirge of Cerberus(?)."" Its obvious that this is nothing more than a good time shoot em' up game complete with appearance of secondary characters from the game (Reeve, Yuffie) as well as some original characters that apparently have a grudge against Vincent. The last trailer is yet another AC trailer showcased on Cinematech's E3-2005 special edition, shown in its entirety. All in all, this section is for those FFVII hard-core junkies than it is the casual gamer. - 3.1/5So all in all, ""ADVENT CHILDREN"" wasn't a bad movie, although it suffered from all the flaws ""APPLESEED"" did. That being trying to cram too much into a short amount of time or having little or no plausible story to go with the CGI. It also suffers from the usual 'I will stop you fiend!' Japanese demeanor (like everything else doesn't). The characters managed to be interesting despite the lack of development and the action was great entertainment. I'm no Final Fantasy VII fan, but SQUARE did a good job with the movie.

Dill - what happened to the the gang in the past two years was covered in the anime short FF VII AC: Last Order that came with the deluxe package of Advent Children. Didn't see it? Well I guess you should do some research before delivering a poor review for something you downloaded on the internet.When the two films are taken together, you have a very satisfying conclusion to the game, even though I am of the mind that its ok to end something without a happy ending. Heck, the Japanese of masters of it! But even when taken by itself, FF VII Advent Children is a wonderful film. It was not made to win Acadamy Awards or to make an in depth character - the game did the second one all by itself. It was made for a target audience, that being the players of the FF series. It delivers on all counts for geeks like me that want to see the game updated from its lego graphics and midi sound files to modern technology. Who knows, maybe if this thing is popular, the FF VII could be updated for the PS3. But I digress. The CGI is awesome, as is the sound. The battles are great, the Japanese Dialog is wonderful (hope this stays for the American release), and if the movie is taken for what it is, its an awesome movie.

928889,A17IS2KTMUBJ52,B000AMJG4Y,Rachael,"[1, 1]","I...am...blown away... This movie is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen. I don't know anything about the Final Fantasy games other than the fact that they exist. So, having very limited knowledge I was really surprised that I understood the movie.The graphics are incredible--in fact I don't think there's a word that'll give the graphics the justice it deserves. I bow down to the creators of this masterpiece. Seriously, the characters might as well be real people; there's little difference. When the movie started I said, ""that's so awesome"" and ""that's so cool"" so many times I had to tell myself to shut up hahaThere's a lot of action in this movie but the whole thing wasn't constant action. There was more to it----there was actually a storyline--not constant warfare like some action movies. In fact I didn't feel once that an action scene was put there just to fill time or live up to standards. This movie pretty much waved at the standards as it flew by on its mega cool motorcycle, surpassing it at warp speed, and laughing at the standard's pathetic ways.I must admit that the reason I chose to watch this was a shallow one; I thought the character Cloud was cute. So I found the movie trailer, watched it and thought ""This looks pretty interesting..."" and now that I've watched this movie I am absolutely floored at how good it was. You must see this for yourself.

928890,AQR22MPF45M3P,B000AMJG4Y,Rachel Ford,"[0, 0]","Like Advent Children (incomplete?), this is a good movie. It adds much new footage to the original, much of which is very, very good. Unfortunately, it fails in some areas that the previous version did not.For starters, the previous version led you on Cloud's path of discovery - as he discovered what, exactly, the Remnants were up to, so did you. In this version, Rufus spills the beans almost immediately.Which brings me to another point. Uninterrupted monologues can be fine in books, but they become rather tedious in movies; and, unfortunately, not only is Rufus now King of Destroying-the-Suspense, he's also King of Nonstop-Monologues. ;) Seriously, Rufus is one of my favorite characters in the movie, so, theoretically, more talking from him is a good thing. But Rufus is also a very concise, calculating talker; he doesn't give away anything more than absolutely necessary. This came across perfectly in the first film; not so in the second.Now, arguably, the audience already knows what happens, so spilling the beans early on isn't a big deal; I don't mean to imply that the movie is ruined (or anything of the sort) by it. I do think it lacks a sense of intrigue that the first maintained, though. The tension that the characters' quest for answers created helped to make the movie interesting each time; now they know, almost immediately. Also, some of the added scenes (at least for me) didn't add much to the movie. There's a fine line, I know, between enhancing the FF saga and making a great movie; I think a lot of the additional scenes were aimed at continuing and enhancing the saga rather than making a spectacular movie. Which, again, is not to say that they were bad; they were good, but I view them as someone coming from the FF7 saga.Finally, on the visual level, the Blu Ray version is awesome, and AC Complete generally looks fantastic. The only exception to that would be the heavy-handed application of dirt smudges during fight scenes, etc. While the idea of adding realism through dust, rumpled clothes, etc., is a great one, I think they went a little overboard at times; dumping dirt on the characters is just as bad as having none.Now, all of this said, keep in mind that I am highlighting the problems with the movie, and saying little about the good parts of the movie. I do this in large part because most of what the original had going for it, this has going for it. It IS a good movie, despite its flaws, with an interesting story line, fun characters, and lots of action.

928895,A3NIY8MCAMPT27,B000AMJG4Y,"Rhinus ""The Butcher""","[3, 8]","I remember back in the day when i first played FFvii. It was the kicker that kinda set off all the RPGs. The story was excellent, the graphics disgusting but who cared when the storyline was beautiful and the dialogue was better than average. The characters were memorable for their individual quirks and reactions to situations and such and who can forget the stories they brought along with them? it was the GAME!and then they made a movie...Since Sephiroth's dead, they can't rightly put him back in, but since it seems that was the whole central point of the movie [a bit lame], they did it anyway. The whole movie centers around Cloud trying to get over his feelings of worthlessness [sound familiar?]. We see Tiffa a few times, but we see Rufus more than any of the other characters [except Cloud since he's the star]. Red and Cid get like three lines, if that[and let's face it, they are Awesome!], and so does Yuffie, or Cait Sith. It's just disappointing how little the team work was shown, however there is ONE really neat scene where they all help in clobbering a monster. Other than that, it's just Cloud doing his thing.There arent that many fight scenes and when there are... well, here in the matrix and dragon ball z spoiled world, let's just say they're kinda old school, you know what i'm talking about... TOO SHORT!The dialogue in Jap is ok, it sounds just like any other regular movie [nothing special], but the dubbed English version... well... it sounds the same but... the words are really, really cheesy. Sure i understand all the girly bad guys [however there is ne bad guy who actually looks like a guy], want to find Mother for what ever reason, but come on, we don't need to here the constant ""Ahh... OOf, RAH!"" True that sometimes there needed to show how much struggle is going on, but not when there are more of them than understandable words, and the words that are there aren't really worth listening to.The Graphics are breath taking, and the only reason why i added a star. They are so good i thought i was watching a real life movie in some places. but...the whole reason why FF vii was such a success was because it was so different form other RPGs and because of it's great story and characters. The movie kinda just follows cloud and forgets about everyone else, so much so that when they all do come out... it really looks like they just slapped it on at the last minute. The whole central plot is a bit vague and lame too, no more monster's to take out, no more world to save, no one's looking for trouble, life seems normal... perhaps in the FF vii world, it should stay so unless by some strange miracle the writers can think of an original way to bring sephiroth back or... perhaps think about making a better bad guy who keeps the long hair and katana sword...In recent months, movies based off of video games are hitting the movie theatres and shelves slowly but surely. With halo possible coming in 2007 as a movie, and silent hill still in theatre's, it's little wonder why most of them are disappointing. Video games that are good are like books, really, really long. Until producer's get over the mortal terror, and start making epic films, there will be a few satisfied faces, and a lot of other disappointed ppl behind, knowing full well it could have been alot better.rent this movie before you spend money on it. if you're a die hard ff vii fan, watch it for old times sake. If you've played the game and fell in love with it because of the story and characters... the movie is a sorry excuse for a sequel, as most are.The bonus feature's are really good, they provide alot of hope in their previews of upcoming, and previous games and such, as well as interviews with the creator, and a few more extra goodies.",2,awe man...,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,3765,"['remember', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'i', 'first', 'played', 'FFvii', 'was', 'kicker', 'set', 'off', 'RPGs', 'story', 'was', 'excellent', 'graphics', 'disgusting', 'who', 'cared', 'when', 'storyline', 'was', 'beautiful', 'dialogue', 'was', 'better', 'average', 'characters', 'were', 'memorable', 'individual', 'quirks', 'reactions', 'situations', 'such', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'stories', 'brought', 'along', 'was', 'GAME', 'then', 'made', 'movie', 'Sephiroth', 'dead', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rightly', 'put', 'back', 'was', 'whole', 'central', 'point', 'movie', 'bit', 'lame', ']', 'did', 'anyway', 'whole', 'movie', 'centers', 'Cloud', 'trying', 'get', 'feelings', 'worthlessness', '[', 'sound', 'familiar', ']', 'see', 'few', 'times', 'see', 'Rufus', 'more', 'other', 'characters', '[', 'Cloud', 'star', ']', 'Red', 'Cid', 'get', 'three', 'lines', '[', 'let', 'face', 'are', 'Awesome', ']', 'so', 'Yuffie', 'Cait', 'Sith', 'just', 'disappointing', 'how', 'little', 'team', 'work', 'was', 'shown', 'however', 'ONE', 'really', 'neat', 'scene', 'where', 'help', 'clobbering', 'monster', 'Other', 'just', 'Cloud', 'doing', 'thing.There', 'arent', 'many', 'fight', 'scenes', 'when', 'are', 'well', 'here', 'matrix', 'dragon', 'ball', 'z', 'spoiled', 'world', 'let', 'just', 'say', ""'re"", 'kinda', 'old', 'school', 'know', 'what', 'i', ""'m"", 'talking', 'TOO', 'SHORT', 'dialogue', 'Jap', 'ok', 'just', 'other', 'regular', 'movie', '[', 'nothing', 'special', ']', 'dubbed', 'English', 'version', 'well', 'same', 'words', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'cheesy', 'Sure', 'i', 'understand', 'girly', 'bad', 'guys', '[', 'however', 'ne', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'actually', 'guy', ']', 'want', 'find', 'Mother', 'what', 'ever', 'reason', 'come', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'here', 'constant', 'Ahh', 'OOf', 'RAH', 'sometimes', 'there', 'needed', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'struggle', 'going', 'not', 'when', 'are', 'more', 'understandable', 'words', 'words', 'are', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'worth', 'listening', 'to.The', 'Graphics', 'are', 'breath', 'taking', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'i', 'added', 'star', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'i', 'thought', 'i', 'was', 'watching', 'real', 'life', 'movie', 'places', 'whole', 'reason', 'why', 'FF', 'vii', 'was', 'such', 'success', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'different', 'form', 'other', 'RPGs', 'great', 'story', 'characters', 'movie', 'kinda', 'just', 'cloud', 'forgets', 'everyone', 'else', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'do', 'come', 'out', 'really', 'just', 'slapped', 'last', 'minute', 'whole', 'central', 'plot', 'bit', 'vague', 'lame', 'too', 'more', 'monster', 'take', 'out', 'more', 'world', 'save', 'one', 'looking', 'trouble', 'life', 'normal', 'perhaps', 'FF', 'vii', 'world', 'should', 'stay', 'so', 'strange', 'miracle', 'writers', 'can', 'think', 'original', 'way', 'bring', 'sephiroth', 'back', 'perhaps', 'think', 'making', 'better', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'long', 'hair', 'katana', 'sword', 'recent', 'months', 'movies', 'based', 'video', 'games', 'are', 'hitting', 'movie', 'theatres', 'shelves', 'slowly', 'surely', 'halo', 'possible', 'coming', '2007', 'movie', 'silent', 'hill', 'still', 'theatre', 'little', 'wonder', 'why', 'most', 'are', 'disappointing', 'Video', 'games', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'books', 'really', 'really', 'long', 'producer', 'get', 'mortal', 'terror', 'start', 'making', 'epic', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'few', 'satisfied', 'lot', 'other', 'disappointed', 'ppl', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'alot', 'better.rent', 'movie', 'spend', 'money', ""'re"", 'die', 'hard', 'ff', 'vii', 'fan', 'watch', 'old', 'times', 'sake', ""'ve"", 'played', 'game', 'fell', 'love', 'story', 'characters', 'movie', 'sorry', 'excuse', 'sequel', 'most', 'are.The', 'bonus', 'feature', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'provide', 'alot', 'hope', 'previews', 'upcoming', 'previous', 'games', 'such', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'creator', 'few', 'more', 'extra', 'goodies']",N/A

928898,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B000AMJG4Y,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[5, 5]","A friend let me borrow a subtitled Japanese DVD of this movie, with a simple recommendation: ""You'll love it.""  And he was right.To be honest, I haven't played a Final Fantasy game since the original one for the NES, which means that I missed out on ""Final Fantasy VII,"" the game this movie is essentially a sequel to.That said, I was nevertheless enthralled by ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children.""  I could tell, as the story played out, that there were things I was missing out on.  Characters were introduced that I wasn't familiar with but were obviously important somehow, and plot points, while summarized enough so that I could understand them, would clearly have been more meaningful if I was familiar with the story of the game. This should have meant that I couldn't get into the film -- but I did anyway.I think it was the animation that captivated me at first; it is beautiful throughout.  The film is entirely computer-animated, with a strong leaning toward attention to detail and realism in appearance.  While the textures don't quite meet up to the high standard set in ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within,"" they don't have to.  The animation for ""Advent Children"" is stylized to just the right degree, with lots of detail, and a sense of motion that most CGI films just can't capture.  It's here, in the quick movements of characters and how they interact with scenery, where the animation actually exceeds that of ""Spirits Within,"" as that film didn't capture motion quite as effectively.  Most noticable in the battle sequences (and there are a LOT of those), character movements are quick, natural, and always make sense in the surroundings.The story, like all ""Final Fantasy"" stories, is epic and world-spanning, but manages to get across a great deal of emotional depth as well.  That's where I really got swept up, after I got used to the animation -- the feeling that is put into the people in this story shows how much they meant to the makers of the film, and to those who love the characters so much.  By the end of it, I found myself feeling the same way, even though I only understood a fraction of what had come before.  If I had been so quickly swept up in it, what kind of effect would it have on those who knew the whole story?From what I gathered, ""Advent Children"" takes place about two years after the conclusion of the events in the game, with the world mostly in ruins and a sort of plague sweeping across it.  Starting with Cloud Strife and Tifa Lockhart, characters from the game are quickly re-introduced and the story takes over.  Filled with lots of action and heartfelt emotion, it's the kind of tale that defines epic storytelling on a truly grand scale, from indivudual relationships to an evil that could threaten the world, and an incredible conclusion that is both visually stunning and emotionally satisfying.""Advent Children"" begins with a sort of dedication, white text against a black screen: ""To all those who once loved this world, and who spent hours with their friends therein, it's time for a reunion."" That seems to be the overall theme expressed in the film, on of reunion. These characters are old friends who have drifted apart, reuniting once more to unite in a powerful battle.  Seeing them work together is awe-inspiring, and their sense of camaraderie is infectious.For fans of the series, as much as for the characters themselves, I can already see that ""Advent Children"" is a chance to re-unite with these characters you loved, one more time.

When one looks at the video transfer of 'Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within', you'd expect Advent Children to look stunning in HiDef, and it doesn't.  Not entirely.  To it's credit, the additional 28 minutes that have been restored to the film look to have been mastered in particular for 1080p (you really notice skin texture and edges of things, and there's some 'pop'), but when the scenes shift back to the original film, the overall sharpness drops, and occasionally it's downright blurry, and there's weird blocky edges, especially in scenes with high contrast.It feels like the original cut of the film had it's image deliberately softened, and now for this video release they've just cranked up the gamma and noise reduction. Resident Evil:Degeneration had a better picture than this.Other than that, the new material fleshes out the film better than ever.. some of the music has been changed for the better as well (fans will note the Nibelheim Theme gets used during the church montage), the bonus features, including a sneak peek at FF XIII are most welcome, in what's otherwise kindof an average BluRay presentation.A mixed bag.

928903,A2AXNXBHIGHCDL,B000AMJG4Y,"Rowena Wendy Lim ""anime reviewer""","[2, 2]","I played Final Fantasy VII many years ago, when I was still single and living in my dad's house. I'm now married with two children and so you can just imagine how long ago that was. I still know my party members -- Cloud, Tifa, Aeris, Barret, Vincent, Yuffie, Cid, and Red XII, but the other characters? With the exception of Jenova and Sephiroth, my mind was a complete blank. In terms of game events, the only thing I remember vividly is Aeris' death. Since I don't have the time nor inclination to replay FFVII, a chunk of the film's plot connections with the game was lost on me. Of course that's probably what the FFVII Digest included in the DVD release is for, but any gamer will attest that nothing can replace the experience of actually beating the game before watching the movie.But that's the beauty of Advent Children. It's so straightforward and spectacular that one can get blown away purely because of the visuals. As I've said earlier, two years have passed since Cloud and friends defeated Sephiroth. A band of silver-haired and green-eyed Jenova fanatics led by a guy named Kadaj has emerged. They will do anything to retrieve Jenova's head and whatever materia (gem-like spheres with powers) they can get their hands on in order to bring about the ""reunion"" (a.k.a. the resurrection of Sephiroth). Cloud returns to Tifa after wandering around by himself, and one by one his old comrades show up in order to help him stop Kadaj and company. It's a very simple RPG-esque plot, but it's the journey that makes the movie. Eye-popping action sequences take up about 80% of screentime. Just about everyone is given the chance to show off their awesome fighting moves, weapons, and limit breaks. I was totally immersed in Advent Children, which is really all about Cloud finding himself behind the context of saving the world.Advent Children's art and animation surpass all the Final Fantasy games' visuals that precede it. The character designs remain faithful to the game's, only this time the blocky 3D renditions are replaced with very realistic models that could very well pass for human at a glance. The texture of the skin, the luminosity of the eyes, the movement of the hair... it's all too perfect. You won't be able to take your eyes off them especially when they start to fight. The furious yet impossibly smooth action sequences are just too mesmerizing. You can spend the next hour just watching these guys (and gals) take on each other. The settings and locales such as mountains, forests, and cityscapes are also as superbly detailed as the characters.I must admit, I felt a bit cheated after watching Advent Children. My memory of the game is no longer what it was, and I felt I was not able to get the full effect that was intended by the creators. It is, however, undeniably a visual feast that's worth treating yourself to player or not. Just watch it. Go oooh and aaah over it. After all, this is what a real Final Fantasy film is (not the totally un-Final Fantasy The Spirits Within).",4,Not for the uninitiated.,1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,3018,"['played', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'single', 'living', 'dad', 'house', ""'m"", 'now', 'married', 'two', 'children', 'so', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'how', 'long', 'ago', 'was', 'still', 'know', 'party', 'members', 'Cloud', 'Tifa', 'Aeris', 'Barret', 'Vincent', 'Yuffie', 'Cid', 'Red', 'XII', 'other', 'characters', 'exception', 'Jenova', 'Sephiroth', 'mind', 'was', 'complete', 'blank', 'terms', 'game', 'events', 'only', 'thing', 'remember', 'vividly', 'Aeris', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'inclination', 'replay', 'FFVII', 'chunk', 'film', 'plot', 'connections', 'game', 'was', 'lost', 'course', 'probably', 'what', 'FFVII', 'Digest', 'included', 'DVD', 'release', 'gamer', 'will', 'attest', 'nothing', 'can', 'replace', 'experience', 'actually', 'beating', 'game', 'watching', 'movie.But', 'beauty', 'Advent', 'Children', 'so', 'straightforward', 'spectacular', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'blown', 'away', 'purely', 'visuals', ""'ve"", 'said', 'earlier', 'two', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'Cloud', 'friends', 'defeated', 'Sephiroth', 'band', 'silver-haired', 'green-eyed', 'Jenova', 'fanatics', 'led', 'guy', 'named', 'Kadaj', 'emerged', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'retrieve', 'Jenova', 'head', 'materia', 'gem-like', 'spheres', 'powers', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'order', 'bring', 'about', 'reunion', 'a.k.a', 'resurrection', 'Sephiroth', 'Cloud', 'Tifa', 'wandering', 'around', 'one', 'one', 'old', 'comrades', 'show', 'up', 'order', 'help', 'stop', 'Kadaj', 'company', 'very', 'simple', 'RPG-esque', 'plot', 'journey', 'movie', 'Eye-popping', 'action', 'sequences', 'take', 'up', 'about', '80', '%', 'screentime', 'Just', 'everyone', 'given', 'chance', 'show', 'off', 'awesome', 'fighting', 'moves', 'weapons', 'limit', 'breaks', 'was', 'totally', 'immersed', 'Advent', 'Children', 'really', 'Cloud', 'finding', 'context', 'saving', 'world.Advent', 'Children', 'art', 'animation', 'surpass', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'games', 'visuals', 'precede', 'character', 'remain', 'faithful', 'game', 'only', 'time', 'blocky', '3D', 'renditions', 'are', 'replaced', 'very', 'realistic', 'models', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'pass', 'human', 'glance', 'texture', 'skin', 'luminosity', 'eyes', 'movement', 'hair', 'too', 'perfect', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'take', 'eyes', 'especially', 'when', 'start', 'fight', 'furious', 'yet', 'impossibly', 'smooth', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'mesmerizing', 'can', 'spend', 'next', 'hour', 'just', 'watching', 'guys', 'gals', 'take', 'other', 'settings', 'locales', 'such', 'mountains', 'forests', 'cityscapes', 'are', 'also', 'superbly', 'detailed', 'characters.I', 'must', 'admit', 'felt', 'bit', 'cheated', 'watching', 'Advent', 'Children', 'memory', 'game', 'no', 'longer', 'what', 'was', 'felt', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'was', 'intended', 'creators', 'however', 'undeniably', 'visual', 'feast', 'worth', 'treating', 'player', 'not', 'Just', 'watch', 'Go', 'oooh', 'what', 'real', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'film', 'not', 'totally', 'un-Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within']",N/A

One day, the unwanted portion of his past starts comming back to him in a liveable way, and it all started with talking to hillarius rivals, Reno, Rude and a familiar man in a wheelchair.  Yazoo, Kadaj,and Loz are 3 men despratly looking for their mother, and after pulling a hit and run on Tifa and taking Barret's daughter Marlene, Cloud searches for Marlene and runs into the three. They considered Cloud once a brother is now a traitor in their eyes.  With all of this, whats to become of the dark road ahead of Cloud?This movie has lighting quick fightseenes and special effects.  Hypertense paulsing fights that are pretty awsome.  And this movie stays loyal to the game.  sticks to the story, usage of lifestream, usage of magic and summon materias, and the rest of the team's cast:Barret, Yuffie, Cid, Vincint, Caith Sith, and Red XIII.  unfortunatly one is still dead and in memories, and there is a familiar face who refuses to be a memory.  There also is some comic relief displayed by Reno and Rude, who I can acually laugh at when they're dumb.  I remember I couldn't laught at them in FF7, cuz when I was a rookie, I sucked and they lit me up like times square.  And also Loz who had a Final Fantasy victory music ringtone for his phone while he was fighting Tifa.(At first I thought it was being too loyal to the game until Loz answered his phone and it stopped.)Final Fantasy 7 Avdnet children is a great continuation to one of the greatest games ever made.  The thing that shines the most out of this is it has a conclusion with a exlamation mark at the end, and not a question mark.

If you loved the game, you should love the movie. It was great to see the characters come to life in the movie. The game was such a classic but there was no voice acting in the game. I have to say that they made each character exactly they way I pictured they would be. From the voices to the interactions, to the story. It's amazing. The blu-ray version is longer and well worth the extra time. It even explains some of the back story from FFVII so it does help for people that haven't played the game. It actually combines all three versions of the film to one - hence the name Advent Child Complete. It's the final version of the movie.The movie did do good in sales. It was the #1 best-selling Japanese anime movie in North America in 2006 and it won best anime feature at the American Anime Awards in 2007. If you own the original DVD, I would highly recommend you get the blu-ray version.If you have seen spirits within and not played the game, then you might not get the movie. I would only suggest to everyone that gave this a 1 or 2 star review to play the game or buy the blu-ray version that has a lot of the back story. If you are planning to buy this just because you saw spirits within, I would not recommend it until you play the original FFVII game. You won't appreciate the characters, the story, the interactions, the feelings, etc. until you have been through the game.IMO, buying this movie and giving it a bad review without ever playing the game doesn't make sense. It's like buying the blu-ray version without owning a blu-ray player. It just doesn't make sense. It's like saying Chewbacca lives on Endor with the Ewoks. Why would an 8 foot tall Wookie live on a planet with 3 foot tall Ewoks? It just doesn't make sense. I know I just used the wookie defense from Southpark but I hope you get the point.If you have a PS3, you can buy or download the original game and play through it (Yes PS1 games will play on PS3) or it's on the PSP. Do everyone a favor and play the game first before seeing this movie and giving it a bad review!",5,Great continuation to FFVII,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,2157,"['are', '700', 'reviews', 'so', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'short', 'bought', 'Blu-ray', 'version.Great', 'movie', 'loved', 'game', 'should', 'love', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'characters', 'come', 'life', 'movie', 'game', 'was', 'such', 'classic', 'was', 'voice', 'acting', 'game', 'have', 'say', 'made', 'character', 'exactly', 'way', 'pictured', 'would', 'be', 'voices', 'interactions', 'story', 'amazing', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'longer', 'well', 'extra', 'time', 'even', 'back', 'story', 'FFVII', 'help', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'game', 'actually', 'three', 'versions', 'film', 'one', 'hence', 'name', 'Advent', 'Child', 'Complete', 'final', 'version', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'did', 'do', 'good', 'sales', 'was', '1', 'best-selling', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'movie', 'North', 'America', '2006', 'won', 'best', 'anime', 'feature', 'American', 'Anime', 'Awards', '2007', 'own', 'original', 'DVD', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'get', 'blu-ray', 'version.If', 'have', 'seen', 'spirits', 'not', 'played', 'game', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'get', 'movie', 'would', 'only', 'suggest', 'everyone', 'gave', '1', '2', 'star', 'review', 'play', 'game', 'buy', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'lot', 'back', 'story', 'are', 'planning', 'buy', 'just', 'saw', 'spirits', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'play', 'original', 'FFVII', 'game', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'characters', 'story', 'interactions', 'feelings', 'etc', 'have', 'been', 'game.IMO', 'buying', 'movie', 'giving', 'bad', 'review', 'ever', 'playing', 'game', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'buying', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'owning', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'saying', 'Chewbacca', 'Endor', 'Ewoks', 'Why', 'would', '8', 'foot', 'tall', 'Wookie', 'live', 'planet', '3', 'foot', 'tall', 'Ewoks', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'know', 'just', 'used', 'wookie', 'defense', 'Southpark', 'hope', 'get', 'point.If', 'have', 'PS3', 'can', 'buy', 'download', 'original', 'game', 'play', 'Yes', 'PS1', 'games', 'will', 'play', 'PS3', 'PSP', 'Do', 'everyone', 'favor', 'play', 'game', 'first', 'before', 'seeing', 'movie', 'giving', 'bad', 'review']",N/A

However, as a TV game fan (Biohazard, Devil May Cry, Metal Gear Solid series), I am always fascinated by the superb CG of Square, in particular those trailers from FF8 onwards.  Watching FF AC is like experiencing an ACT game and enjoying the marvelous CG trailers without the need to go thru hours of gameplay. Some may dislike it. However, as an impatient and slow middle aged man, I like that a lot. I had watched FF Spirit Within. Nevertheless, it just resembles too much a Hollywood cartoon (in particular the character and the costume design) and lacks style. FF AC basically removes all the shortcomings of FF SW. Nothwithstanding the story (hard to compare coz FF SW is an original creation whilst FF AC is an extension of FF7 the game), FF AC got better of everything as per my review title. The action/fighting scenes are simply the best I had watched so far for a CG movie. In short, dont miss it.p.s.

928912,AZ7X1ED2UGEL2,B000AMJG4Y,Shadow mage,"[5, 7]","I just rented this movie today, I've been dying to see it, but I wanted to wait for the english dub, at last it's here!After watching the whole movie from begining to end, here's what I have to say...The english dub exceeded my expectations! Yes, the voice acting is actually good! I was afraid that they might screw up the character's voices, but luckily, they didn't!The story is a little bit lacking, but with FFVII as a big part of the story it would be hard to fit much more story in without making it very long. The story is pretty straight forward, 3 grey-haired guys show up asking where their mother is, (they're Sephiroth's brothers looking for Jenova.) A disease called Geostigma is making the population sick, and Cloud has to fight those 3 grey-haired guys.All of the characters from FFVII are in this movie, they were all done very well except for Cid... First of all they made him too young, he looks like a teen when in FFVII he was in his late 30's. He's also overly American-looking, and get this... He has a Texan acsent, and not just an ordinary one, it's way too strong so he sounds like a hick! That was very disappointing to me... All of the others are okay though.The graphics for this movie are nothing short of breath taking! You have to watch it for a second before you realize that the characters aren't real people! You can actually see the fabric that makes up the Character's clothes! (FyI, I dont have an HD TV.) Everything looks great!Pros:Barret, Cloud, Cid, Tifa, Red 13, Cait Sith, Vincent, and Yuffie are all back and better looking than ever!The CGI graphics for this movie are excellant, and very real-looking!You finally get some closure to the FFVII story, which I feel it despretly needed.All the characters are well represented, and remain true to their respective personalities.Some of the Limit Breaks make an appearence in this movie!There's an option to view a mini movie which shows cut scenes that show you in retrospective what happened in FFVII.This movie has a great ending, and a happy one at that!Cons:The story is kinda simple and straight forward, there isn't much depth to it.Some scenes in this movie are a little corney... In one scene Weapon starts attacking people, and all of the characters show up out of nowhere to fight it. (Justice Legue assemble!!!)They totally wrecked Cid by making him look and talk the way that he does. Honestly, they've turned him into a regular Whitey Mc'cracker! (Thankfully, Zack & Aeris weren't...)Sephiroth's brothers are real moma's boys! They're always crying over stuff and whining for their mommy. When you watch Sepiroth's bros fighting with Cloud and the others, in the scene celections menu you'd imagine the scene to be titled, ""Battle of the overly sensitive grey-haired people"".This movie's story is very depressing, if it weren't for the comic relief provided by Reno & Rude, this movie would be almost unwatchable.Overall: All things considered, this movie is actually pretty good, and when you compare it to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, it's a masterpiece!I plan on buying a copy for myself once I have the money.As funny as this is going to sound, I recomend renting it before you buy it, but if you're confident that you're going to enjoy it, then go ahead and buy it first.For Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, I give this movie 3 and 3/4 Stars!Final thoughts: While some people say that you should just buy the original subtitled version, I think that you should buy this one. If you buy the subtitled version then you cant watch it in English, but if you buy this version you can either watch it in Japanese with English subtitles or you can just plain watch it in English. Besides, if you buy this version then you have the option to view it both ways and see which way best suits you.If you own a PSone or PS2 I recomend playing the game too!",3,The gang's all here...,1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,3864,"['just', 'rented', 'movie', 'today', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dying', 'see', 'wanted', 'wait', 'english', 'dub', 'last', 'here', 'watching', 'whole', 'movie', 'begining', 'end', 'here', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'english', 'dub', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'Yes', 'voice', 'acting', 'actually', 'good', 'was', 'afraid', 'might', 'screw', 'up', 'character', 'voices', 'luckily', 'did', ""n't"", 'story', 'little', 'bit', 'lacking', 'FFVII', 'big', 'part', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'fit', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'making', 'very', 'long', 'story', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', '3', 'grey-haired', 'guys', 'show', 'up', 'asking', 'where', 'mother', ""'re"", 'Sephiroth', 'brothers', 'looking', 'Jenova', 'disease', 'called', 'Geostigma', 'making', 'population', 'sick', 'Cloud', 'fight', '3', 'grey-haired', 'guys.All', 'characters', 'FFVII', 'are', 'movie', 'were', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'Cid', 'First', 'made', 'too', 'young', 'teen', 'when', 'FFVII', 'was', 'late', '30', 'also', 'overly', 'American-looking', 'get', 'Texan', 'acsent', 'not', 'just', 'ordinary', 'one', 'way', 'too', 'strong', 'so', 'hick', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'others', 'are', 'okay', 'though.The', 'graphics', 'movie', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'breath', 'taking', 'have', 'watch', 'second', 'realize', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'people', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'fabric', 'up', 'Character', 'clothes', 'FyI', 'dont', 'have', 'HD', 'TV', 'Everything', 'great', 'Pros', 'Barret', 'Cloud', 'Cid', 'Tifa', 'Red', '13', 'Cait', 'Sith', 'Vincent', 'Yuffie', 'are', 'back', 'better', 'looking', 'ever', 'CGI', 'graphics', 'movie', 'are', 'excellant', 'very', 'real-looking', 'finally', 'get', 'closure', 'FFVII', 'story', 'feel', 'despretly', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'represented', 'remain', 'true', 'respective', 'personalities.Some', 'Limit', 'Breaks', 'make', 'appearence', 'movie', 'option', 'view', 'mini', 'movie', 'cut', 'scenes', 'show', 'retrospective', 'what', 'happened', 'FFVII.This', 'movie', 'great', 'ending', 'happy', 'one', 'Cons', 'story', 'kinda', 'simple', 'straight', 'forward', ""n't"", 'much', 'depth', 'it.Some', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'little', 'corney', 'one', 'scene', 'Weapon', 'attacking', 'people', 'characters', 'show', 'up', 'nowhere', 'fight', 'Justice', 'Legue', 'assemble', 'totally', 'wrecked', 'Cid', 'making', 'look', 'talk', 'way', 'Honestly', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'regular', 'Whitey', ""Mc'cracker"", 'Thankfully', 'Zack', 'Aeris', 'were', ""n't"", 'Sephiroth', 'brothers', 'are', 'real', 'moma', 'boys', ""'re"", 'always', 'crying', 'stuff', 'whining', 'mommy', 'When', 'watch', 'Sepiroth', 'bros', 'fighting', 'Cloud', 'others', 'scene', 'celections', 'menu', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'scene', 'be', 'titled', 'Battle', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'grey-haired', 'people', '.This', 'movie', 'story', 'very', 'depressing', 'were', ""n't"", 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'Reno', 'Rude', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'unwatchable.Overall', 'things', 'considered', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'when', 'compare', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'masterpiece', 'plan', 'buying', 'copy', 'myself', 'once', 'have', 'money.As', 'funny', 'going', 'sound', 'recomend', 'renting', 'buy', ""'re"", 'confident', ""'re"", 'going', 'enjoy', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'first.For', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'Advent', 'Children', 'give', 'movie', '3', '3/4', 'Stars', 'Final', 'thoughts', 'people', 'say', 'should', 'just', 'buy', 'original', 'subtitled', 'version', 'think', 'should', 'buy', 'one', 'buy', 'subtitled', 'version', 'then', 'cant', 'watch', 'English', 'buy', 'version', 'can', 'either', 'watch', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'can', 'just', 'plain', 'watch', 'English', 'Besides', 'buy', 'version', 'then', 'have', 'option', 'view', 'ways', 'see', 'way', 'best', 'suits', 'you.If', 'own', 'PSone', 'PS2', 'recomend', 'playing', 'game', 'too']",N/A

Those who have no knowledge of the game will be severly confused.  As I am a fan of the game, I was extensely happy when this movie was announced for release (when they announced it years ago) and was not disipointed.Graphically, the movie is beautiful (as are apparently all the characters in it) and flawless in my opinion.Story-wise, it strikes the hearts of FF7 fans the most and, as I mentioned before, might be confusing to those who have little or no knowledge of FF7 (even though Marlene over-views the game at the beginning of the movie).~The story takes place mainly within Midgar and is full of both explainations, surprises, action, and drama...~The group is back and faced with a task to stop new enemies; the Turks help out, too; And our Hero, Cloud, has to rekindle his fighting spirit in order to save all that he cares about and the world--a task only he would be able to acomplish as his Showdown of Fate continues--and finally gains a long-waited resolution...Audio: There are several returning FF7 songs that have been upgraded for this movie--even to the battle-victory theme (haha; I hadn't expected it...so I burst out laughing).  The music fits, overall, and lives up to the FF legacy.  The ending theme (are we getting the Japanese song in the US?) was cool, just as the ending sequence it was playing in.Extras: Hmm...not sure what we're all getting in the US...but for the lucky ones, some of the Japanese versions came with the ""Last Order"" OAV--we are not getting this in the US, I believe (which I find rather stupid).  I believe we're getting the trailers (which I already have seen like 50-million times), but I'm not sure until I buy it...Overall, it's Great.  It could have been better if they had made it longer~!  It's full of fast-passed action which will make fans tingly as you watch it two or three times in a row to catch everything (such as the little pink-ribbon on our 8 heroes' arms), and to laugh at the Turks antics again and again, and laugh at the bad-guys for being fooled for half the movie by a character I used to hate.Well...I shan't go into any more detail on the movie (I'll just go watch it again).Favorite Quote the the Whole Movie~: """"Watashi wa...Omoide niwa nara nai sa...""""

I still play through it more than most of my other games.  To be honest, Final Fantasy VII is truly one of the greatest games ever made.  A sequel to Final Fantasy VII comes off more as fan service than anything else, however.There's a new virus going around.  Geo-stigma.  Most of the people affected by this virus happen to be children.  There's little that anyone can do to stop the spread of this virus.  Even worse, for Tifa, Cloud has run off and is the lone wolf he always was.  Kind of strange, actually, considering how he turned out at the end of the game.  There's more to the plot.  A group of people are looking for mother (Jenova).Fan service isn't always bad, mind you.  Here it isn't bad, but it is, for the most part, something that will only satisfy the fans.  When you step back and really look at Advent Children, it's a really ""cool"" movie, but a sequel that really didn't need to be made in the first place.  Had Final Fantasy VII not been so popular, this sequel wouldn't exist in the first place.  Say Final Fantasy VI was more popular than VII, Final Fantasy VII would not have a sequel at all.The fight scenes are magnificant, that's for sure.  They look really glamourous, but they eventually become all that the movie is about.  I love the fight scenes, but a lot of them began to drag on longer than they should've.The story, about halfway through, takes a backseat to action.  Even worse is that the characters have little to no development at all.  When all the charactes from Final Fantasy VII reunite to fight a battle against a monster (a ""boss"" fight, to put it into perspective for RPGers), this is about the only time you see most of them, and when you do, they hardly utter any lines.  Even Cloud and Tifa don't have a whole lot of development to them, and it's Cloud's story.Another asset of the story that begins to suffer is that for those who loved the game as much as I do, there are plot points that happened in the game that most of the creators of this movie either forgot or ignored completely.Then, of course, there's the return of Sephiroth.  Another chalk up to fan-service.  Sephiroth just has a huge cult following, that's it.  The way he's even squeezed into the movie is just strange.  The fight scene that ensues between him and Cloud is breathtaking, but it was just really hard to understand why he actually needed to be there in the first place.Another thing that really hurts Advent Children is that the story doesn't even take itself seriously.  It relies more on glamourous fight scenes and slap stick humor by supporting characters rather than actual storytelling.  The game was all about story.  The movie is about glamour and satisfying hardcore Final Fantasy VII fans like myself.  Unfortunately, when I saw the sequel, I was actually expecting it to be done for more than just fan-service.To its credit, though the CGI is fantastic.  Almost humanistic.  Far superior to any CGI that has ever been used before.  Even better, is that for those who love games, the CGI really makes it feel like a video game at some points.  That's exactly how this movie should feel.  It is, after all, a sequel to a video game.  The voice acting also isn't so bad.  Never are dubbed voices as good as their japanese counterparts, but for the most part, the voice work isn't bad.The music is also satisfying.  Most of it is remixed from the game and series as a whole.Fans of Final Fantasy VII will be absolutely stunned by it.  Those who haven't played Final Fantasy VII at all would probably do best to stay away from this movie.  However, those who watch the movie a couple times and then sit back and take a look will realize that this movie isn't really serious.  It's mostly about satisfying fans, and it does that.  When you look at it as a movie, though, and not as Final Fantasy merchandise, it's a letdown.  It really should've been better than it was.  It should've done what the game did.  That is: give your own story and characters a little more credit.Advent Children isn't a bad movie.  Not at all.  I'm sure Final Fantasy VII Fanboys (and girls) will be absolutely pleased by this movie.  But I'd rather just stick with the game I've had for nine years and can never seem to grow tired of.  As fan-service, the game works.  Fan service isn't always bad, but for me it was just unsatisfying.  If they'd made the movie for more than just to satisfy the desires of fans, it would've been so much better.Finally: Why only Final Fantasy VII?  I understand it's said to be the best in the series but every Final Fantasy has it's own cult following.  I hear it's even getting a remake on the PS3.  The Final Fantasy games before VII (with the exception of FFIII) have gotten nothing but ports despite that the fans devoted to other Final Fantasy games like IV and VI show so much more devotion than fans of FFVII do.  It would be nice if other Final Fantasy games got some share in the credit as well.  Instead Square seems to be using Final Fantasy VII as a cash cow, now.It's a good movie, but it's hit or miss for fans.  If you like a lot of beautiful action and don't give a rip about story then you'll absolutely be stunned by Advent Children.  If you want a little more from you movie... story development, character development and emotional involvement then Advent Children can't and won't fulfill these desires.  Every Final Fantasy VII fan should see the movie at least once, though.",3,Light Fan-Service,1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,5586,"['definitely', 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'loved',

928920,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B000AMJG4Y,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[4, 5]","It's been a long, long, LOOOOOONG time coming, but finally the years of endless waiting have paid off. The REAL Final Fantasy movie is released! Of course, the real question burning in everyone's poor brains is, was it worth the insanely long wait? Beyond the hype (if there can be such a thing for a creature of this kind) does there lurk a GOOD movie? Yes. Oh yes.Children Laughing? Is this the end?!Okay, more than a few people (in fact probably most) who played Final Fantasy VII through to the end were massively disappointed by the ending. Like the terrible ending for KOTOR II: The Sith Lords, there was no closure whatsoever. So epilogue, no explanations of how everything ultimately ended, nada. Ouch. Every saga needs a good ending that wraps things up. The sequel is not really a stand-alone feature so much as an oh-so-necessary wrap-up that everyone was entitled to in the first place. What does this mean?First of all, it means this movie will not make a whole lot of sense if you've never played the game before. If you don't know who Sephiroth is, who Rufus is, who the heck Cloud and Aeris and Tifa are, you're going to be like a person opening up the last issue of Infinite Crisis or House of M from the local comic shop and expecting to understand what's going on. It ain't happening. Not that that's a bad thing necessarily. American movies as a whole waste WAY too much time explaining everything, rather than building on the universe that already exists (like good comics or video games do). In other words, if you've played the game before, you're going to love all the little touches and tributes in honor of what amounted to a cultural phenomenon: Final Fantasy VII.Second of all, none of that time-consuming backstory explaining (a quick wrap-up will do thank you very much) leaves lots of room for character interaction and animated action. And is there every action.Motorcycles and Materia and Animated Mayhem. Oh my!Everyone who's seen a trailer for this movie has gotten a taste of the animated glory to be found. As a friend of mine who was an animation student told me, SquareSoft has had problems in the past with making their animated human beings animate and move like real humans should, but all those problems are gone as of now. They look better than real people, the animation is perfect, and every scene of this movie is a spectacular treat for the eyes. If there was ever a movie that makes me think I need a better TV (yet again) this would be it.More than that though, the action scenes are the kind of over-the-top sword-slashing, power-sliding, acrobatic eye-candy that everyone's been craving in their summer flicks, but haven't had since George Lucas last laid on the movie cheese. I could try to describe the movie scene by scene, but you really should see this one for yourself. Oh, and you'll love the motorcycle chase later in the film. Guaranteed.The Fantasy RemixedOh, and did I mention the music? I went into this movie expecting quite a bit musically. I'm one of those crazed gamers who downloads all the remixes off the net, who's got the Final Fantasy Concert cd, and who could probably name where ever piece of music in the game is taken from in the game. I am here to tell you that this movie has the best soundtrack I've heard in an action movie possibly ever. There are orchestral versions of epic themes, piano versions of individual themes, and techno-rock remixes of battle themes. You might think that mixing three types of music like that would end up a jumbled mess, but instead it manages both to do justice to the genius of one of the greatest composers in Japan AND provide a beautiful, touching, moving, score that has plenty of bite. I own the soundtrack actually...And so he takes sword in hand once again...And then there a friend of mine who said that no matter how great the visuals, you get used to them after a while and there has to be some substance. In other words, there has to be a story and some interesting performances to make a good movie. Thank goodness this one does not disappoint.Sure, there's a new cast of villains bent on yet another ""reunion"", a new infection cause by Jenova, and lots great tribute moments to be found, but the REAL story here is not the revival of Sephiroth, it's the redemption of Cloud's soul. The death of Aeris is one of those video game events that EVERYONE knows about (like Mario fighting Bowser or Ganondorf stealing the Tri-Force). And her death was the last straw that made Cloud decide to hunt down and kill Sephiroth. But you just know...after letting her die there's no way Cloud could forgive himself.In a series of flashbacks, memories, and dialogs with Aeris in his own mind, the real conflict of the movie is brought to the fore, fought, and ultimately resolved, giving the longed-for closure that the game never got. This story is ultimately about Cloud moving on, and learning to forgive himself. It makes for an ending that is SOOOOO satisfying.There's only two things I wish were different about this movie, and they're both musical. First of all, the awesome piano remix of the Overworld theme from Final Fantasy VII found in the version of the film shown at the Venice Film Festival is missing, and so is the single most recognizable piece of music in the whole Final Fantasy repertoire, The Prelude. There's something magical about that piece (in fact it's my favorite piece of music in the world, not just from video games), and it really would have made my decade to have an orchestral version. Ah well, perhaps in the next Final Fantasy movie...",5,The Day is Here!,1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,5586,"['been', 'long', 'long', 'LOOOOOONG', 'time', 'coming', 'finally', 'years', 'endless',

928921,A18ZRJMVMRS0SE,B000AMJG4Y,"Subayaitori ""Tristan Vick""","[7, 29]","Now, for visuals I would definitely give ""Final Fantasy: AdventChildren"" a 9 out of 10. Yet, with all the technology improvementssince ""Spirits Within"" the characters in ""Advent Children"" still seemmannequin like.Although they used rotoscoping, and the characters movements seem morenatural, I can't get past the lack of muscle flex. No amount of prettytextures and dynamic lighting will fix this eye soar. I really wishthey would have followed the example of ""Shrek 2"" and used underlyingmuscle fiber expansion technology and made the characters arms flex,and their body's bulge as if they were real. Instead it seems as ifandroids are walking around stiffly mimicking human movements, unawareof their stiff mannequin rigidness.The characters faces are amazing, especially Cloud, Tifa, and the childnamed Denzel. All the characters faces are amazing, but another problemis they made all of the characters eyes a tad too big.As a fan of Anime, I understand the influence, but it looks weird tosee realistic people with overly big ""bubble-eyes""... for me this tookaway from the realism of the characters. After all, this form ofanimation is to replicate realism as seen by the human eye, whereas atraditional animated feature allows you to enjoy the impressionism. Forsome reason, the big eyes just seemed weird to me, up to the credits atthe end of the film.As for story...what story? Everyone is saying it's an amazing story,well, it is if you neglect a little something called plot. There isnone. The film seems more like cut-scenes from an unreleased video gamestrung together. Oh, it's based of off Final Fantasy 7 the game yousay? Well, if I was into video games I would have gone and played itand maybe the movie would have made inkling more sense. As it was, Iwas constantly confused by the cuts which jumped from here to there forno story telling reason. As a person who enjoys animation, this filmwas eye candy from the start. But I don't think avid anime, film, andmovie goers should have to have extensive ""gaming"" backgrounds to enjoya good movie. It should have had a story, after all, every good filmdoes.In the end, you have to let yourself get caught up in the ""fantasy"" ofthis film just to even sit through it. If you can handle a flurry offights with constant camera movement, eye confusion, blurriness,disorientation, and the extremely choppy story which makes no sense,and the cut scene styled editing which (apparently) gamers dig, and theoverly apparent product placement hype: it's a video game tie infolks!; then you won't have wasted your money.If you're about well developed and paced stories with intriguingcharacters (and don't want to waist your time playing a game just toget a clue) then ""Advent Children"" is not going to be your cup of tea.But if you just like a visual fiesta of color, texture, and rich 3-Ddetail which will pop out like a brilliant work of art, a wonderfulmusical score (the best part of this film, then by all means have agreat time enjoying the pretty pictures.",2,"Grand visual, less plot and more confusing than ""Spirits Within""",1128729600,"10 8, 2005",2005,3014,"['Now', 'visuals', 'would', 'definitely', 'give', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'AdventChildren', '9', '10', 'technology', 'improvementssince', 'Spirits', 'characters', 'Advent', 'Children', 'still', 'seemmannequin', 'used', 'rotoscoping', 'characters', 'movements', 'seem', 'morenatural', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'lack', 'muscle', 'flex', 'amount', 'prettytextures', 'dynamic', 'lighting', 'will', 'fix', 'eye', 'soar', 'really', 'wishthey', 'would', 'have', 'followed', 'example', 'Shrek', '2', 'used', 'underlyingmuscle', 'fiber', 'expansion', 'technology', 'made', 'characters', 'arms', 'flex', 'body', 'bulge', 'were', 'real', 'Instead', 'ifandroids', 'are', 'walking', 'stiffly', 'mimicking', 'human', 'movements', 'unawareof', 'stiff', 'mannequin', 'rigidness.The', 'characters', 'are', 'amazing', 'especially', 'Cloud', 'Tifa', 'childnamed', 'Denzel', 'characters', 'are', 'amazing', 'problemis', 'made', 'characters', 'eyes', 'tad', 'too', 'fan', 'Anime', 'understand', 'influence', 'weird', 'tosee', 'realistic', 'people', 'overly', 'big', 'bubble-eyes', 'tookaway', 'realism', 'characters', 'form', 'ofanimation', 'replicate', 'realism', 'seen', 'human', 'eye', 'whereas', 'atraditional', 'animated', 'feature', 'enjoy', 'impressionism', 'Forsome', 'reason', 'big', 'eyes', 'just', 'seemed', 'weird', 'up', 'credits', 'atthe', 'end', 'film.As', 'story', 'what', 'story', 'Everyone', 'saying', 'amazing', 'story', 'well', 'neglect', 'little', 'something', 'called', 'plot', 'isnone', 'film', 'more', 'cut-scenes', 'unreleased', 'video', 'gamestrung', 'together', 'Oh', 'based', 'Final', 'Fantasy', '7', 'game', 'yousay', 'Well', 'was', 'video', 'games', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'played', 'itand', 'maybe', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'inkling', 'more', 'sense', 'was', 'Iwas', 'constantly', 'confused', 'cuts', 'jumped', 'here', 'forno', 'story', 'telling', 'reason', 'person', 'who', 'animation', 'filmwas', 'eye', 'candy', 'start', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'avid', 'anime', 'film', 'andmovie', 'goers', 'should', 'have', 'have', 'extensive', 'gaming', 'backgrounds', 'enjoya', 'good', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'story', 'good', 'filmdoes.In', 'end', 'have', 'let', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'fantasy', 'ofthis', 'film', 'just', 'even', 'sit', 'can', 'handle', 'flurry', 'offights', 'constant', 'camera', 'movement', 'eye', 'confusion', 'blurriness', 'disorientation', 'extremely', 'choppy', 'story', 'sense', 'cut', 'scene', 'styled', 'editing', 'apparently', 'gamers', 'dig', 'theoverly', 'apparent', 'product', 'placement', 'hype', 'video', 'game', 'tie', 'infolks', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'wasted', 'money.If', ""'re"", 'about', 'well', 'developed', 'paced', 'stories', 'intriguingcharacters', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'waist', 'time', 'playing', 'game', 'just', 'toget', 'clue', 'then', 'Advent', 'Children', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'cup', 'tea.But', 'just', 'visual', 'fiesta', 'color', 'texture', 'rich', '3-Ddetail', 'will', 'pop', 'out', 'brilliant', 'work', 'art', 'wonderfulmusical', 'score', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'then', 'means', 'have', 'agreat', 'time', 'enjoying', 'pretty', 'pictures']",N/A

Some new scenes have been added and there are some that have been changed a bit to make them better. For example, the last battle scene has been changed to be more violent and the highway scene has been changed to be even better. I have not followed the FF series and I only played one FF game ever. That was X-2. As for the CGI quality in the movie, it's the BEST I'VE EVER SEEN. You can see the veins in a persons eye, the details in the buildings and lanscapes as well and you even tell what a persons clothes are made of.The video quality of this movie is great but I think it would have been better if they had added more vibrant colors instead of a darker color scheme. Some parts are vibrant though.The audio quality is really awesome. The sound effects of motor bikes and other noises are realistic. If you're wondering about the Japanese audio, that's in TrueHD 5.1 as well. So if you hate the English audio switch it to Japanese. The Japanese audio is better.This movie loses 1 star for the lack of vibrant colors throughout. I like the movie and its one of my favorites.

928923,A358CBXDEJYBCG,B000AMJG4Y,"SystemStructure ""System uses Meditate!  A goo...","[2, 4]","I am a longtime fan of the Final Fantasy series.  As a kid, I played and beat the very first one they made and have kept track ever since.  It's hard to say exactly why these things fascinate me.  But they do.Of all the reasons I can think of it probably boils down to the fact that when they make these things, it's not just about making a buck on cheap entertainment.  Final Fantasy is something that grips you, both in the way that an excellent book can or a great movie sometimes does.  One, it makes you think and two, you interact with it.  The best ones of all are generally agreed to be: FF4, FF6, FF7, FF10 and the online epic, FF11.  Seven was a turning point in many ways, it was vastly different from the previous versions.  It was the first time they really made an effort to make it less like a game... and more like a truly interactive movie.  Seven changed the entire video game industry forever in the late 90's, just like how Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda changed everything in the 1980's.  One other thing worth mentioning is that FF7 was one of the first games to feature a Black Man (""African American"") in one of the key starring hero roles.  This might have had an influence on the spectacular sales of Seven (featuring a cast with a wide variety of racial backgrounds as they team up to prevent a planet wide crisis).So, the question is, how does non-interactive Final Fantasy measure up?  In this case I can say, pretty darned good.  The CG animation is amazing, particularly in the textured surfaces, like the look they created to simulate woven fabric ... incredible.  The voice acting is a godsend for us American and UK folks - they got it as good to perfect as they possibly could.  They also include a much appreciated recap of Seven's story to bring us up to speed (complete with stirring orchestrated music - prepare for a literal trip down memory lane).  FYI the main antagonist is named Sephiroth he is Cloud's former leader who at the end of Seven tried to become some sort of false divinity (A ""One-Winged Angel"" suggesting his lack of some critical quality that only a real angel would possess).  Oh yeah and some clarification of the whole ""mother"" theme and why the bad guys constantly say it.  It is connected to the planet and the environmental crisis.  The planet is ""mother earth"" a life giving source of energy.  Jenova is the ""mother"" which the bad guys talk about (cells from a Jenova sample were grafted into Sephiroth and others DNA thus they call Jenova their mother) ... an alien lifeform that crashed into their planet in a huge meteor long ago.  Jenova thus rivals and tries to replace the planet as the ""mother"" figure.It's not a cinema classic (yet, it certainly could be a cult classic) but it is a very well thought out, visually stunning motion picture that anyone can watch and enjoy.  The action sequences have a touch of the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" syndrome to them (i.e. they fly around a lot), but in a world where magic and materia are the norm, you don't really mind it.  Once again I would like to underscore that the CG graphic animation is mind blowing.  They also got certain characters down absolutely perfect - it was a joy to see old characters like Yuffie, Rufus and Reno still around!  So sit back, open those eyes and take in the final chapter of Seven.  Very much worth the price of admission!",4,My review,1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,3379,"['am', 'longtime', 'fan', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'series', 'kid', 'played', 'beat', 'very', 'first', 'one', 'made', 'have', 'kept', 'track', 'ever', 'hard', 'say', 'exactly', 'why', 'things', 'fascinate', 'do.Of', 'reasons', 'can', 'think', 'probably', 'down', 'fact', 'when', 'make', 'things', 'not', 'just', 'making', 'buck', 'cheap', 'entertainment', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'something', 'way', 'excellent', 'book', 'can', 'great', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'One', 'think', 'two', 'interact', 'best', 'ones', 'are', 'generally', 'agreed', 'be', 'FF4', 'FF6', 'FF7', 'FF10', 'online', 'epic', 'FF11', 'Seven', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'vastly', 'different', 'previous', 'versions', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'made', 'effort', 'make', 'less', 'game', 'more', 'truly', 'interactive', 'movie', 'Seven', 'changed', 'entire', 'video', 'game', 'industry', 'forever', 'late', '90', 'just', 'how', 'Nintendo', 'Legend', 'Zelda', 'changed', 'everything', '1980', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'mentioning', 'FF7', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'games', 'feature', 'Black', 'Man', 'African', 'American', 'one', 'key', 'starring', 'hero', 'roles', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'influence', 'spectacular', 'sales', 'Seven', 'featuring', 'cast', 'wide', 'variety', 'racial', 'backgrounds', 'team', 'up', 'prevent', 'planet', 'wide', 'crisis', '.So', 'question', 'how', 'non-interactive', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'measure', 'up', 'case', 'can', 'say', 'pretty', 'darned', 'good', 'CG', 'animation', 'amazing', 'particularly', 'textured', 'surfaces', 'look', 'created', 'simulate', 'woven', 'fabric', 'incredible', 'voice', 'acting', 'godsend', 'American', 'UK', 'folks', 'got', 'as', 'good', 'perfect', 'possibly', 'could', 'also', 'include', 'much', 'appreciated', 'recap', 'Seven', 'story', 'bring', 'up', 'speed', 'complete', 'stirring', 'orchestrated', 'music', 'prepare', 'literal', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'FYI', 'main', 'antagonist', 'named', 'Sephiroth', 'Cloud', 'former', 'leader', 'who', 'end', 'Seven', 'tried', 'become', 'sort', 'false', 'divinity', 'One-Winged', 'Angel', 'suggesting', 'lack', 'critical', 'quality', 'only', 'real', 'angel', 'would', 'possess', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'clarification', 'whole', 'mother', 'theme', 'why', 'bad', 'guys', 'constantly', 'say', 'connected', 'planet', 'environmental', 'crisis', 'planet', 'mother', 'earth', 'life', 'giving', 'source', 'energy', 'Jenova', 'mother', 'bad', 'guys', 'talk', 'cells', 'Jenova', 'sample', 'were', 'grafted', 'Sephiroth', 'others', 'DNA', 'thus', 'call', 'Jenova', 'mother', 'alien', 'lifeform', 'crashed', 'planet', 'huge', 'meteor', 'long', 'ago', 'Jenova', 'thus', 'rivals', 'tries', 'replace', 'planet', 'mother', 'figure.It', 'not', 'cinema', 'classic', 'yet', 'certainly', 'could', 'be', 'cult', 'classic', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'visually', 'stunning', 'motion', 'picture', 'anyone', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'action', 'sequences', 'have', 'touch', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'syndrome', 'i.e', 'fly', 'lot', 'world', 'where', 'magic', 'materia', 'are', 'norm', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'Once', 'again', 'would', 'like', 'underscore', 'CG', 'graphic', 'animation', 'mind', 'blowing', 'also', 'got', 'certain', 'characters', 'down', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'was', 'joy', 'see', 'old', 'characters', 'Yuffie', 'Rufus', 'Reno', 'still', 'around', 'So', 'sit', 'back', 'open', 'eyes', 'take', 'final', 'chapter', 'Seven', 'Very', 'much', 'price', 'admission']",N/A

Not so fast.  Unlike studios such as Pixar, Square seems to believe adding imperfections to an otherwise flawless source somehow enhances the viewer experience.  The same thing was done in ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" where dirt and film grain was added to an entirely digital picture source.  I actually prefer the blu-ray release of that film to this one.  Add on top of that most of the DVD features for Advent Children have been changed or completely left out, forcing completists to own both versions of this movie to have all the bonus content, a film that is not worth that much trouble in my opinion.  Overall, Square really dropped the ball on this one, the picture is soft, fuzzy and washed out in most scenes where it could have been brilliantly vibrant and clear.

928925,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000AMJG4Y,Terry Mesnard,"[1007, 1071]","It's been almost four years since I first saw Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children and wrote my review for Amazon.com.  After seeing the new complete version on Blu-Ray, I thought I'd come back and offer my thoughts only to discover that my original review was transferred over from the DVD edition.  That review was written at a different time, before the DVD was even released in the States.  I thought about going back and revising it, but that'd be changing the past.  What I will add are my thoughts on the new Blu-Ray edition.Firstly, if you're looking at the Blu-Ray edition, wondering if it's a worthy purchase, it definitely is.  It's a much superior version to the original, both in content and clarity.  Obviously, with the Blu-Ray the picture quality and sound quality have been considerably increased.  There's a few little nitpicks, such as a shimmering, aliasing problem that pops up every now and then (The Resident Evil: Degeneration Blu-Ray had a similar problem) and it can be distracting.  But the details are so much clearer now that it looks like a new movie.Additionally, new content has been added to this release.  A lot of times, ""director's cuts"" can be detrimental to the film and the pacing, but in the case of Advent Children, I appreciated the new content.  I believe there's an additional 26 minutes added and these parts delve into the Geostigma and the origins of some of the characters as well as an extended fight between Cloud and Sephiroth.  Overall, I think the additions are useful and help make the movie more of a movie and less an extended cut scene.  It's just too bad that it didn't come with a playable demo of Final Fantasy XIII like it did in Japan...On to my original review as it was back in 2005:Cloud, Tifa, Sephiroth, Marlene, Barret, Vincent. The names could go on. This series reigns in many Final Fantasy fans' minds as being the best. Though in recent years a lot of people roll their eyes and say its over-rated (and it might be), for me, and for a lot of fans, Final Fantasy was a turning point in the genre not only in terms of graphics and presentation but also in story. I have been playing video games and RPGs since the very first NES. Final Fantasy VII was the first game that made me stop and go, wait when did a video game become something more than just pushing buttons?Now we have the official sequel, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Advent Children is basically a love note written for the fans of VII. Those who did not invest 40, 50, 60+ hours into the game will probably have no interest in it. But those who were shocked when (should I even say spoiler?) Sephiroth murders Aeris, who have a deep connection to the characters, and over the 40-60+ hours grew so attached to them that to this day they still draw fan art or look for that elusive way to get Aeris back in game(it doesn't exist, by the way), this movie will mean something.AC is a beautiful CG movie taking place two years after the events of FFVII. While the ending of VII was climactic and exhilarating, providing a resolution of sorts to the people of Midgar, it did not provide a resolution, happy or not, for Cloud. In fact, it left him empty and hurt as we find in the beginning of Advent Children. What AC does is finish Cloud's story. Another reviewer here made a comment that he liked FFVII's ending. I do too, don't get me wrong. But the one thing it didn't do was end Cloud's story.  For the length of the game, you have a deeply personal story surrounded by the world story and while the world got its ending, the people involved did no, unhappy or not. As I said, AC ends Cloud's story with a bang. And it is damn well worth the wait.I don't think it would be right of me to talk about what happens in AC. Part of the fun and surprise is to see how well it fits together, brings memories of the video game and works to create an emotional core. I will keep the review as spoiler free as possible because I know I'm tired of reading reviews where people stick in something that can ruin the whole movie.For those who didn't play or watch FFVII, this movie will not have much resonance since it's basically for the fans, both die-hard and casual. Those who loved FFVII will more than likely love this movie. AC is basically an action movie and the action is spectacular although the slow motion was used (while effectively) a little much. The sword play, the battles and the action is all directed with style oozing everywhere. The characters are all animated exceedingly well and the animators did a great job in making PS1 characters into spectacular CG. The musical score varies for me from being excellent to just okay. By far, the best moments are ones I can't talk about aurally for fear of spoiling surprises. Needless to say, the music is at its greatest when it brings in hints of FFVII, the video game.There are a lot of connections to both VII and the Final Fantasy series as a whole. From moogle dolls to The Turks, the game oozes both FFVII and FF; although I was disappointed in not seeing any chocobos, there are a few moments that made up for it. One in particular revolves around the games End Battle Theme. Hilarious, laugh out loud scene. There are some minor annoyances. A couple of the scenes felt episodic and not connected. Some scenes were directed very well and lead into each other or intercut between each other. But there are a couple scenes that stand out because they didn't feel attached to what was going on. In fact, it felt as if they were cut scenes from a video game. Did this detract from the movie? Not in the least, but its there nonetheless.What surprised me the most with this movie is that it wasn't done to milk the saga. I mean, of course its there to make money, and FFVII is a great way to do it because of fans' love for it. Anything in the business world is made around making money. But what I mean exactly is best represented in FFX-2. I am one who did not find FFX-2 at all interesting. In fact it is the only FF game I gave up on. It felt like it was a way of milking FFX for a little more money while the wait for FFXII kept getting longer and longer. However, AC is so intrinsically related to VII that it has a heart and emotion that I haven't seen in many movies released this year. I felt chills from the very opening moments as the narrator explained some of the events from VII and we see a flashback of Sephiroth standing in front of flames. And that was just the start of the thrills; there are scenes both emotional and thrilling to be found throughout the 1 hour 40 minutes of the film. And what satisfied me above all else was that Cloud's story finally received a perfect resolution.I think most fans have been hoping and wishing that Aeris would return and I think the creators give a great answer to this in this movie. I won't spoil the ending, I won't tell you who does and doesn't return. But I will tell you the resolution is damn well awesome and probably the most satisfying ending to what is by far many people's favorite (if clich&eacute;d) choice for the Final Fantasy series. I do need to make a plea and I apologize for it, but if you downloaded this movie (like a certain reviewer did *cough*) please support it when it comes out here in the States and buy it. We need to show support to Square-Enix that this is the kind of sequel we want to see. They spent a long time and a lot of money making a movie that is direct to DVD here in the states. We need to return the favor and support it.Square-Enix, my hats off to you for handling this with flair, tenderness and sympathy for the characters.",5,Brings back memories,1126828800,"09 16,

I dont know I probablly excepted too much, but an over complicated uninvolving story, Poor Pacing, Ludacrious action sequences, silly dialogue and inch deep charachter depth really wasnt what should have been expected but is what became of it. Theres about hour worth of story which in excess to the rest of the running time is padded with ridicluous action scenes (i dont recall the charachters being able to fly). And the little and no invlovement of the chracters is a let down. Its really sad because to the eye it for the most time pleases and the cgi maybe some of the best ive ever seen. aside from the ham fisted action there is a general atmospheric touch to the visuals and the quiter scenes display good sense of mood that aid those touches. But it could've been alot more.

I at the time had no idea what FF7 was, other than people played it A LOT years before.  I took home the Advent Children dvd when it was released and really liked it.There seemed to be quite a bit of mythology in place that I wanted to learn and did...I liked Sephoroth's character and enjoyed the end battle very much.When I saw in the upcoming release catalogs we got, that a deluxe edition was coming out I immediately ordered myself a copy.  The big seller for me was the included anime that sort of acted like a prequel/backdrop for Advent Children.This set also was advertised to include a number of goodies and also the case appeared GORGIOUS.Well I got my set and here is my review, years overdue:**Pros**The case is indeed top-notch.  The goodies are abundant.  The anime was included as advertised.  This release like all others also included all cut scenes from the FF7 game as well, to get those not familier up to speed, and also to take the veterans of the franchise down memory lane.  At the time I thought the fight scenes were amazing and like the CG quality overall as well.**Cons**The included anime is only subbed, no dub at all.  Also it really doesn't explain much or appear very necessary to watch.  It is very short and Cloud doesn't hardly do anything in it.The goodies are overated.  The script for the movie is not anything I want to read.  The short stories included are not that great, save for one.There are ""post cards"" included.  Filler in my opinion.**And Then...**Like a preverbial kick in the nuts, there is another cut of FF7: Advent Children released on Blu-Ray.  THIS CUT ROCKS!!!  The studio has completely re-done the fight scenes, included blood now, added Sephoroth's infamous one wing and much, much more.  It truly is a different movie.  The movie that should have been released.  In my opinion, the studio rushed out the first cut, then it seems they tweeked around with it for years and then after seeing they had produced a truly SPECTACULAR film compared to the first cut, decided to release it again.  This COMPLETE CUT is the only version anyone should own.If you have not purchased this film yet, PLEASE, PLEASE buy the Blu-Ray Complete Cut, it's the best from the scenes I've seen.I unfortunately plan to re-buy the Complete Cut now.

I played it a year or two ago. I really liked FFVII.I did not like this film, however. Like I wrote in my blog, this film is about 100 minutes long and approximately 70 minutes are action sequences, 20 minutes are flashbacks and 10 minutes are plot related. There was almost NO plot what-so-ever. (Lol because of this negative response, watch the ""helpfulness"" meter above become very low... that always seems to happen with people who don't like something.) Final Fantasy is always known for it's great character interactions and story and I think the FF team tried to make up for FF Spirits Within by doing the complete opposite. FFSW was all plot, FFVII is all action, no plot.The action, however, was very good. I loved how they translated the gameplay into action sequences. I really enjoyed how they got past the jumping high in the air by doing throws for the limit break (I forgot what it is called in FFVII).*Possible Spoiler Here*But the plot was terrible. I REALLY wish they could have gotten equal parts plot and action. The only thing I got out of the plot (besides Kadaj and what he was doing, etc) was that Cloud says ""I'm weak"" at one point and then says ""I'm strong"" at another, and I'm thinking ""WHAT? When did the transition take place? During the flashbacks which were almost carbon copies of the scenes in the game?"" He just SAYS ""I'm weak/strong"" and as a watcher you're supposed to believe it immediately.*End Possible Spoiler*There were so many action sequences, believe it or not, I GOT BORED of them. While they were really cool in themselves, it's like watching Die Hard a billion times in a row.

There may be a little bias involved since Final Fantasy VII (the game this movie is a sequel to, for anyone who isn't aware) is one of my favorite games. The CG is beautiful, some of the best I've seen out of all the CG movies out there. The action is great, it might seem a little ridiculous to some, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, and really given the nature of the movie I wouldn't call it ridiculous by any means. The characters were of course good, however I was a little disappointed that they didn't give some of them larger roles, it seemed like it was basically just Cloud and Tifa on the screen, with a little bit of Vincent and the Shinra cast thrown in here and there. I'd of liked to see more of Barret, Red XIII, Yuffie, etc. The story, while I enjoyed it and thought fit in very well with the FFVII universe, could possibly be hard to understand and follow if you have not played the game. Overall, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is a good movie, and even better if you've played and liked the game.

I look forward to FFXII and the tentative third installment of FFVII.  I looked forward to this movie.  I have seen it three times, in order to try and absorb everything I could, in the hopes that there was SOMETHING that I missed from the first two watchings.Why, then, do I give this two stars?  Because there wasn't anything more to it.  Anything more to this movie you might see will be a mix due to your love of FF7 and your experiences with the game.  I could go on and on ad nauseum and repeat many of the same accolades and pitfalls that I have seen in other reviews.  It's safe to say that the majority of the pluses are indeed good points about the film.  This film is a visual masterpiece, and should define what CGI movies should be on a visual level. The music is great if you're into rock and cheesy riffs (which I am and I absolutely LOVE the soundtrack, despite the naysayers) It is also an adequate adaptation of a video game series. Most of the problems listed are also pretty consistent with my experiences.  The action is jerky and extremely unrealistic, characters are glossed over and tacitly written off as if they do not exist, much of the ending of the game is patently ignored in favor of making a half-hearted typical Hollywood-style movie but failing in most respects.  Ultimately the action is too ludicrous and takes up too much of the movie's real estate, while little things like ""plot"" or ""character development,"" which made the GAME WORTH PLAYING, suffer in this absence.The most important question I have to ask is this: if this movie's plot were translated into a game with FF7-style graphics, even as a sequel to FF7, would it be worth playing?I would have to answer ""hell no"" to this.  Without the graphics and the Final Fantasy name, this movie reveals its total lack of substance, and is a total anathema to everything that is Final Fantasy.

The gray grunge of a crumbling urban world comes through well - sometimes the subdued palette tells the story better than brighter colors could. The only disappointment in the animation came towards the end, when people's hair and clothes were immersed in water. I was waiting to see how the animators would present it. Apparently, the characters all use a shampoo based on Scotch-Guard, so their locks remained loose and wispy even after complete immersion. Likewise, clothes soaked in water never took on the waterlogged look I hoped for. Still, the animation stands at the peak of current technology.On top of that, I applaud the ecological consciousness of this movie. It uses 100% recycled plot elements; no new ideas were harmed in the making of it. Big cool motorcyles, oddly oversized and elaborate weaponry, flying-swordsman fight scenes, earth at risk from man's greed, super-secret government lab creating the ultimate warrior - you get the idea.I enjoyed watching this once.

Scott Heitman,"[7, 8]","First things first- if you haven't played the game RECENTLY or at least read plot analysis as a refresher, then you're going to miss half of the dialogue/plot in this movie.  In a risky move, this film is serious about being made for fans of Final Fantasy to the exclusion of other potential viewers.  I've just seen the film for the second time after finally refreshing myself.  It's surprising how much more the plot made sense and how little comments made sense.  People have argued that the plot is weaker than they were hoping for- I think these are probaby the people that played the game ages ago and thus have no recollection of some of the important but intricate details from the game.Instead, the plot is heartwarming, comedic at times, and wonderfully dramatic at others.  It brings back the nostalgia associated with the colorful characters from the game and successfully expands the concepts from the game.  Even the ambiguity of the love interests in FF7 is kept intact.All of that said, non FF7 fans won't dislike the movie- it's just that fewer of them will love it.  The detail of the animation is definitely leagues beyond Pixar- the clothing at the very least is photorealistic.  Roughly half of the movie consists of pure action and it is superb.  I HAVE NEVER SEEN BETTER ACTION CHOREOGRAPHY BEFORE.  Several moments in the film are just so creative and unbelievable that I couldn't keep my admiration silent.  If you're an action buff, regardless of familiarity with FF7, you will love this film.Finally, Nobuo Uematsu's score successfully manipulates tunes fromm FF7 into new and interesting arrangements....one towards the end, in particular, is amazing.The discs come with a reasonable amount of extras.  Most importantly, the dub is impressive.  I watched it only because a friend wanted to, but I can honestly say that I would watch the dubbed version again; it ADDED character to some of the characters....Cid, Yuffie, and Red in particular were beyond perfect.Truly, this film is a technical marvel and something that no real FF7 fan should miss.",5,A Worthy Release of a Superlative Piece of Art!,1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,2076,"['First', 'things', 'first-', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'game', 'RECENTLY', 'least', 'read', 'plot', 'analysis', 'refresher', 'then', ""'re"", 'going', 'miss', 'half', 'dialogue/plot', 'movie', 'risky', 'move', 'film', 'serious', 'being', 'made', 'fans', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'exclusion', 'other', 'potential', 'viewers', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'finally', 'refreshing', 'surprising', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'made', 'sense', 'how', 'little', 'comments', 'made', 'sense', 'People', 'have', 'argued', 'plot', 'weaker', 'were', 'hoping', 'for-', 'think', 'are', 'people', 'played', 'game', 'ago', 'thus', 'have', 'recollection', 'important', 'intricate', 'details', 'game.Instead', 'plot', 'heartwarming', 'comedic', 'times', 'wonderfully', 'dramatic', 'others', 'back', 'nostalgia', 'associated', 'colorful', 'characters', 'game', 'successfully', 'concepts', 'game', 'Even', 'ambiguity', 'love', 'interests', 'FF7', 'kept', 'intact.All', 'said', 'non', 'FF7', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dislike', 'movie-', 'just', 'fewer', 'will', 'love', 'detail', 'animation', 'definitely', 'leagues', 'Pixar-', 'clothing', 'very', 'least', 'photorealistic', 'Roughly', 'half', 'movie', 'pure', 'action', 'superb', 'HAVE', 'NEVER', 'SEEN', 'BETTER', 'ACTION', 'CHOREOGRAPHY', 'BEFORE', 'Several', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'creative', 'unbelievable', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'admiration', 'silent', ""'re"", 'action', 'buff', 'regardless', 'familiarity', 'FF7', 'will', 'love', 'film.Finally', 'Nobuo', 'Uematsu', 'score', 'successfully', 'tunes', 'fromm', 'FF7', 'new', 'interesting', 'arrangements', '.one', 'end', 'particular', 'amazing.The', 'discs', 'come', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'extras', 'Most', 'importantly', 'dub', 'impressive', 'watched', 'only', 'friend', 'wanted', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'would', 'watch', 'dubbed', 'version', 'again', 'ADDED', 'character', 'characters', '.Cid', 'Yuffie', 'Red', 'particular', 'were', 'perfect.Truly', 'film', 'technical', 'marvel', 'something', 'real', 'FF7', 'fan', 'should', 'miss']",N/A

The animation is mind-blowing and should get the respect it deserves.But, beyond that, the plot totally sucks. The creative team behind this basically digs at the bottom of the plot barrel to cook up a scenario where one of those Jenova-infused clone people touches a piece of Jenova then *POOF!* becomes Sephiroth and remembers everything he did so he and Cloud can fight for half an hour. I suppose this makes sense to someone who's just gotten done watching Dragon Ball all the way through, but it kind of detracts from the quality of the anime.",3,"Beautiful, but plot absolutely rancid",1142640000,"03 18, 2006",2006,635,"['Okay', 'first', 'thing', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'very', 'beautiful', 'anime', 'animation', 'mind-blowing', 'should', 'get', 'respect', 'plot', 'totally', 'creative', 'team', 'basically', 'bottom', 'plot', 'barrel', 'cook', 'up', 'scenario', 'where', 'one', 'Jenova-infused', 'clone', 'people', 'piece', 'Jenova', 'then', '*', 'becomes', 'Sephiroth', 'remembers', 'everything', 'did', 'so', 'Cloud', 'can', 'fight', 'hour', 'suppose', 'sense', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'gotten', 'done', 'watching', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'way', 'kind', 'detracts', 'quality', 'anime']",N/A

While I still enjoyed it thoroughly and my rating then would be the same as now I wanted to put it simply with the added footage none of the complaints are viable anymore in my opinion. The huge gaping plot holes have been masterfully smoothed over and finally it feels truly as a complete add-on to VII's universe. I do say some things aren't made clear still if you haven't played the game but then again if you haven't why are you even watching this. They successfully added to the emotional impact of the film as well with bits and pieces here and there and helped you to reconnect with the old characters a bit more (though this was already it's strong suit) and even manages to connect you with the new characters as well. The style and length it adds to some of the fight scenes though unnecessary, are welcome and fit in seamlessly with the rest of the film. Overall this is a must own now more then ever for fans of VII and it's story. This lives up to it's subtitle of Complete and no longer leaves you wanting more because their are pieces missing still but leaves you wanting more simply for the joy of the connections with the characters and world surrounding it's mytho's.
