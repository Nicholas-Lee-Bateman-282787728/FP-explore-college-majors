Set in the Land of Fiction, &quot;The Mind Robber&quot; is wonderful, whimsical and fantastic (quite literally!). The opening episode is eerie and suspenseful as the plot slowly unfolds. There's a real sense of siege as the TARDIS comes under attack and the scenes in the white void are both surreal and tense. Once the crew reach the Land of Fiction, the story just gets better. Fictional characters such as Gulliver and Rapunzel are full of life and personality (unfortunately so much more than many &quot;real&quot; Dr Who characters!) and there are genuinely frightening moments (such as the confrontation with Medusa). The white robots and clockwork soldiers, although they look very simplistic and obviously BBC models/costumes, both exude an air of menace.

349600,AW135H6P4JXKC,6302993628,buckbooks,"[32, 33]","""The Mind Robber"" was initially derided by Who critics as mere fantasy when, in fact, the story has a solid science fiction foundation: the brain of an unseen alien intelligence must be fed by the musings of a pulp-fiction writer imprisoned in its service. Turn on the commentary text and many of the production problems that contributed to the unique nature of this story are revealed.First, the original four-episode story was stretched to five because the previous story, ""The Dominators,"" didn't offer enough material to pad out its planned six episodes and was cut back to five. So the added first installment of ""The Mind Robber"" had to be improvised on a shoestring budget from existing props and sets. The ""great white void"" which so distinguishes this story was created specifically because ""nothing"" was cheap to depict.Next, actor Frazer Hines contracted chicken pox before shooting on the second episode could begin and had to be temporarily written out of the story. A substitute actor was cast to play Jamie that week with a clever subplot written in to explain his changed appearance.The story, which may seem an incomprehensible jumble at first, actually follows a very logical set of rules exploring the nature of fiction vs. reality. The storyteller, for example, dictates the action, so the Doctor can change the story by writing it himself, but if he refers to himself in the narrative he will become a fictional character and therefore cease to exist.The use of literary figures such as Lemuel Gulliver and Cyrano de Bergerac harks back to one of the series' original objectives, to serve as an educational children's program. Gulliver, for instance, speaks in dialogue lifted mostly from Jonathan Swift's novel. So kiddies who think they're watching a low-budget sci-fi serial are actually getting an introductory course in English lit.This story is a sterling example of the resourcefulness and solid acting that made Doctor Who, particularly the early episodes, such a charming TV series.Finally, a tip to readers about Customer Reviews: When reading reviews of Doctor Who DVDs, take the time to click on the link ""See all customer reviews,"" with the newest reviews listed first. That way, you get to read the most current reviews of the DVD first rather than the ""most helpful,"" which very often were written years before based on a VHS copy or, God bless his heart, a fan's jaded memory of the story from a TV broadcast.",4,An underrated story that illustrates the resourcefulness of the Doctor Who series,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,2446,"['Mind', 'Robber', 'was', 'initially', 'derided', 'Who', 'critics', 'mere', 'fantasy', 'when', 'fact', 'story', 'solid', 'science', 'fiction', 'foundation', 'brain', 'unseen', 'alien', 'intelligence', 'must', 'be', 'fed', 'musings', 'pulp-fiction', 'writer', 'imprisoned', 'service', 'Turn', 'commentary', 'text', 'many', 'production', 'problems', 'contributed', 'unique', 'nature', 'story', 'are', 'revealed.First', 'original', 'four-episode', 'story', 'was', 'stretched', 'five', 'previous', 'story', 'Dominators', 'did', ""n't"", 'offer', 'enough', 'material', 'pad', 'out', 'planned', 'six', 'episodes', 'was', 'cut', 'back', 'five', 'added', 'first', 'installment', 'Mind', 'Robber', 'had', 'be', 'improvised', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'existing', 'props', 'sets', 'great', 'white', 'void', 'so', 'story', 'was', 'created', 'specifically', 'nothing', 'was', 'cheap', 'depict.Next', 'actor', 'Frazer', 'Hines', 'contracted', 'chicken', 'pox', 'shooting', 'second', 'episode', 'could', 'begin', 'had', 'be', 'temporarily', 'written', 'story', 'substitute', 'actor', 'was', 'cast', 'play', 'Jamie', 'week', 'clever', 'subplot', 'written', 'explain', 'changed', 'appearance.The', 'story', 'may', 'seem', 'incomprehensible', 'jumble', 'first', 'actually', 'very', 'logical', 'set', 'rules', 'exploring', 'nature', 'fiction', 'vs.', 'reality', 'storyteller', 'example', 'action', 'Doctor', 'can', 'change', 'story', 'writing', 'narrative', 'will', 'become', 'fictional', 'character', 'therefore', 'cease', 'exist.The', 'use', 'literary', 'figures', 'such', 'Lemuel', 'Gulliver', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'back', 'one', 'series', 'original', 'objectives', 'serve', 'educational', 'children', 'program', 'Gulliver', 'instance', 'speaks', 'dialogue', 'lifted', 'mostly', 'Jonathan', 'Swift', 'novel', 'kiddies', 'who', 'think', ""'re"", 'watching', 'low-budget', 'sci-fi', 'serial', 'are', 'actually', 'getting', 'introductory', 'course', 'English', 'lit.This', 'story', 'sterling', 'example', 'resourcefulness', 'solid', 'acting', 'made', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'particularly', 'early', 'episodes', 'charming', 'TV', 'series.Finally', 'tip', 'readers', 'Customer', 'Reviews', 'When', 'reading', 'reviews', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'DVDs', 'take', 'time', 'click', 'link', 'See', 'customer', 'reviews', 'newest', 'reviews', 'listed', 'first', 'way', 'get', 'read', 'most', 'current', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'first', 'rather', 'most', 'helpful', 'very', 'often', 'were', 'written', 'years', 'based', 'VHS', 'copy', 'God', 'heart', 'fan', 'jaded', 'memory', 'story', 'TV', 'broadcast']",Doctor Who - The Mind Robber VHS

349602,A11GO5VA74HD8K,6302993628,Crazy Fox,"[1, 2]","Maybe it has something to do with the late '60's, but this has to be one of the most surreal, tripped-out ""Doctor Who"" storylines ever. The weirdness starts with the Tardis (that ever undependable vehicle) getting stranded in a blank void outside of space and time, and the Doctor's companions Jamie and Zoe getting lured out into this vast expanse of nothing by hallucinations of their homelands. It gets stranger still when the Tardis flies apart into pieces and the characters are left clinging to the detached console, whirling in an eerily silent slow-motion spin. But all of this is only a prelude to the truly bizarre, as the Doctor, Jamie, and Zoe must then find their way through a labyrinth, challenged along the way by verbal games, mental puzzles, and (most of all) fictional characters from literature and mythology. Basically, the three of them seem to be stuck in an English Lit major's fever dream.In the end there turns out to be a reasonably solid science fiction basis for all of it, of course. Still, this is a remarkably imaginative and unusual tale that plays around with the border between illusion and reality in intriguing and yet utterly entertaining ways. That along with the Doctor's infectious wit (Patrick Troughton is great as usual) and the wonderful chemistry between the characters all make this a rather understated but fine example of ""Doctor Who"" at its best.",5,"""We obey our creator, that is all that can be expected of any character.""",1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1396,"['Maybe', 'something', 'do', 'late', ""'60"", 'be', 'one', 'most', 'surreal', 'tripped-out', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'storylines', 'ever', 'weirdness', 'Tardis', 'ever', 'undependable', 'vehicle', 'getting', 'stranded', 'blank', 'void', 'space', 'time', 'Doctor', 'companions', 'Jamie', 'Zoe', 'getting', 'lured', 'out', 'vast', 'expanse', 'nothing', 'hallucinations', 'homelands', 'stranger', 'still', 'when', 'Tardis', 'apart', 'pieces', 'characters', 'are', 'left', 'clinging', 'detached', 'console', 'whirling', 'eerily', 'silent', 'slow-motion', 'spin', 'only', 'prelude', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'Doctor', 'Jamie', 'Zoe', 'must', 'then', 'find', 'way', 'labyrinth', 'challenged', 'way', 'verbal', 'games', 'mental', 'puzzles', 'most', 'fictional', 'characters', 'literature', 'mythology', 'Basically', 'three', 'seem', 'be', 'stuck', 'English', 'Lit', 'major', 'fever', 'end', 'there', 'out', 'be', 'reasonably', 'solid', 'science', 'fiction', 'basis', 'course', 'Still', 'remarkably', 'imaginative', 'unusual', 'tale', 'border', 'illusion', 'reality', 'intriguing', 'yet', 'utterly', 'entertaining', 'ways', 'Doctor', 'infectious', 'wit', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'great', 'usual', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'make', 'rather', 'understated', 'fine', 'example', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'best']",Doctor Who - The Mind Robber VHS
349603,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6302993628,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[19, 20]","One of the most imaginative stories in Doctor Who took place during the notoriously unpreserved Patrick Troughton era.  Fortunately, The Mind Robber survived the BBC purges for us to enjoy, and it's bizarrely surreal with a capital biz!The TARDIS leaves the space-time dimension into a place where anything is possible.  ""We're nowhere, it's as simple as that.""  Jamie and Zoe enter nowhere, represented by a blank opaquely white background.  The TARDIS breaks up, and they find themselves in a strange land full of life-size toy soldiers, a forest of words, unicorns, a Minotaur, Medusa, Rapunzel, and other characters.They constantly encounter a British sailor who speaks in a well spoken but extraordinary manner, and the Doctor deduces his identity later.Riddles and intuition are helpful in this land.  And the Third Doctor's explanation to Jo in The Mind Of Evil, ""we believe what our minds tell us to,"" is also apropos here.  When Jamie and the Doctor try to rescue Zoe, they hear her voice behind a door without a handle.  ""When is a door not a door?  When it's ajar.""  The door vanishes, and guess what they find Zoe trapped inside?Wendy Padbury stands out as Zoe.  She is cute as a button, in a glittering black catsuit, hanging for dear life on the disembodied TARDIS console like an exotic ornament.  Another time, she has her turn as Emma Peel, using martial arts to overcome the Karkus, a Teutonic comic book superhero.  Christopher Robbie (the Karkus), would return in Revenge Of The Cybermen as the Cyberleader.  Zoe's inquisitive as the Doctor, while Jamie, protective of her as he was with Victoria, is more cautious.  Keirsey would see it as a classic example of a Rational paired with a Guardian.  Her analytical mind and memory comes in useful, as she detects an arithmetic progression in the labryinth.Bernard Horsfall (the British sailor) would appear in two other Who stories (Planet Of The Daleks, The Deadly Assassin).Debits:  the Medusa could have been more convincing, i.e. more frightening (q.v. Clash Of The Titans) and the villain isn't exactly effective.

349604,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,6302993628,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[0, 0]","""Doctor Who: The Mind Robber"" (1968 - Story 45). . .Note: mild spoilers below. please don't freak out.. . .This five-part adventure is a delightful Doctor Who story in which the Tardis, mechanically crippled and imperiled by a massive lava flow, is flung in desperation outside of reality itself, into a realm where reality becomes fluid and up for grabs. The Doctor and his companions are confronted by an array of fictional characters, controlled by a mysterious entity that is bent on conquering the Doctor and forcing him to live by its rules.Originally broadcast in 1968, this is one of the few episodes currently available starring actor Patrick Troughton (the second Doctor) who appeared rather panicky and hysterical in comparison to other incarnations. His sidekicks are fun -- as is their late '60s Carnaby Street-ish fashion -- and it's nice to see his sidekick Zoe (played by Wendy Padbury) portrayed as an extremely capable female character.  Particularly juicy is an action scene where she repeatedly judo flips a superpowered opponent -- ala Emma Peel -- forcing him into submission. The story is a pleasant romp with some interesting ontological twists... Highly enjoyable! I wish more of the Troughton-era episodes were available!

Kindel,"[2, 4]","Since I'm a ""Johnny Come Lately"" to the Doctor Who series, I wanted to get at least one episode featuring each actor who played the Doctor.  And since this story arc includes five episodes, it seemed a good place to view Edward Troughton's Doctor.  The first two of these five episodes, I have to say, were a disappointment.  In fact, it only really picked up when Doctor Who finally confronted the ""villian"" face to face (so to speak) in the fourth episode.  That's when the whole story arc came alive.  Prior to that, Troughton's Doctor struck me as much too timid and cautious. But by the end, it was well worth my time.

349607,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,6302993628,Jason A. Miller,"[1, 1]","The Land of Fiction endures as one of ""Doctor Who""'s more memorable locales, even after nearly 40 years.  Part of this is due to the fact that ""The Mind Robber"" is one of the few Patrick Troughton stories surviving in its entirety, and thus meriting multiple airings on US PBS stations for most of the last 20 years.  I'd like to think the story would endure even if, like ""The Celestial Toymaker"", the master tapes had been wiped.At the outset of ""The Mind Robber"", the Doctor is forced to remove the TARDIS from ""real space"", only to have the time machine materialize ""nowhere""... or, more specifically, the Land of Fiction, first seen as a forest of words populated by clockwork robots, evocative British schoolchildren... and Lemuel Gulliver.  The sinister-voiced Master of the Land tracks their every move, and throws ever more fictional characters into their path.  If it can be said that the middle of the five stallments drags down a bit under repetition (Episodes 2 and 3 have identical cliffhangers), it can also be said that the final episode remains an intriguing battle of wits between the Doctor and the (other) Master, using the computer that powers the Land of Fiction to stage jousting battles between Lancelot and... Cyrano de Bergerac.  This is great stuff!The DVD extras provide the standard amount of comprehensive production detail.  When troubles with the preceding story, the deadly dull ""Dominators"", forced ""The Mind Robber"" to expand by one episode, a last-minute intervention by script editor Derrick Sherwin (a sort of forgotten figure in the DW production pantheon) produced a still-memorable interlude.  Not only do we get an eerie white void locale that prefigures the TARDIS's abudction into the Land of Fiction (a white void digitally inserted by the DVD production team as the backdrop for the interviews on the making-of feature), but we also get extended looks at each of the TARDIS regulars.The DVD features are not the strongest, but they're still solid.  While the text commentary is bursting at the seams with trivia -- not the standard fare reciting dull lists of production dates and guest actors' TV credentials -- it does spoil the audio commentary and the making-of feature, because the same anecdotes are revealed in all three places.  The audio commentary is a bit slow and rambling; director David Maloney gives running commentary on the actors' teeth, for some reason.  The interview with Frazer Hines, who played Jamie opposite the Patrick Troughton Doctor for all but one story in his reign, is rather good.  I learned here, for example, that the production team hoped for Jamie to stick around to travel with the Third Doctor.

349608,A13YAD5KV789CC,6302993628,Jeffrey J. Lyons,"[3, 3]","I was waiting for this one to come out on DVD because I consider ""The Mind Robber"" to be one of the best Doctor Who stories from the 60's.  It is more fantasy than Science-Fiction because the writer, Peter Ling, said he didn't know anything about Sci-Fi when he was contracted to write it.  But you wouldn't know it after viewing it.  The idea of the Doctor and his companions caught in a world of fiction, where well-known characters such as Gulliver or Rapunzel can only say (more or less) the dialogue that they were given by their authors is certainly intriguing.This one also overcame a few challenges during the recording of the show in clever ways.  For one thing Frazer Hines (Jamie) contracted Chicken Pox and had to take an extended leave from the studio.  Since the story was already a bit unusual, they worked in a section where another actor would play Jamie for the duration, without affecting the overall storyline.  Also, at the last minute, the BBC needed a 5 part serial rather than a 4-part serial, so the entire first episode was concocted to build up to the rest of the story.I was already aware of some of these things but the Special Features cover it in more detail.  Watching the features was very enlightening.  Since I have seen every classic Doctor Who episode multiple times I very much enjoy watching these DVD's with the Information Text and Commentary turned on.

349610,A37UPPF989N4EB,6302993628,"JKO ""A Doctor Who Viewer""","[2, 2]","The penultimate pair of releases for 2005 in the Doctor Who catalogue brings together two stories made almost a decade apart from two different eras of the Doctor's long running saga. But both The Mind Robber and The Horror of Fang Rock do have a connection is so much as they come from troubled periods of the show's history.The older adventure, The Mind Robber, was the second story from Patrick Troughton's final season as the intrepid Time Lord. Having spent three years in the role during the era when the show was almost continually on air, Troughton was tiring of the punishing schedule of turning out a weekly episode and in addition the show itself was considered by the BBC to have run it's natural course. Ratings were beginning to dip and viewer satisfaction with the series was waning. And yet, despite the rather lacklustre atmosphere surrounding the show, The Mind Robber proved to be one of the most innovative and original stories ever created for the show. Set in the world of fiction, this story really highlights the creativity of the production team and is a very unusual and brave attempt to do something well beyond the normal sci-fi genre. Visually, the show is astounding and even with the very limited budget, studio space, monochrome broadcast and technology; the land of fiction created by the designers is really very effective. Introducing characters from fiction that can only speak the lines of their text and conjuring up disturbing images and problems for the Doctor and his companions to solve, the show really is quite complex and works very well.That's not to say there aren't challenges. Originally commissioned as a six-part story, the writer struggled to make it barely fill the amended requirement of four episodes. At the last minute, a fifth episode was needed, so the show's script editor (and later producer) Derrick Sherwin had to tag on another stand-alone episode to open the adventure, using nothing but the regular cast and the Tardis set. Subsequently, each episode runs for well under the normal twenty-five-minute length, with episode five coming in under seventeen minutes in length. At least the tedium of some of the longer six-parters is avoided! Frazer Hines was struck down with chicken pox before episode two recording could begin and producers came up with a truly brilliant way of replacing him with another actor for an episode and a half. Plus there are the usual goofs, continuity errors and fluffs that make the black and white era of Doctor Who so charming, but all in all, it really works very well.The same can be said for The Horror of Fang Rock, the companion release made almost a decade later and featuring Tom Baker as the fourth Doctor. Opening the show's sixteenth season, Baker's fourth, this story was penned by Terrance Dicks, who although an infrequent writer for the show, as the script editor on the show from the final Patrick Troughton days through the entire Jon Pertwee era, he is probably the most prolific writer associated with the show. Always able to pen a script at short notice, this story was pulled together in record time when his earlier script (about vampires) fell through. Set entirely in a lighthouse and it's surrounding rocks, the claustrophobia of the piece is wonderfully atmospheric. Rather `Agatha Christie' like in it's set up, the story deals with the sudden one-by-one murders of the characters as the Doctor and his companion Leela try to work out the alien menace attacking the crew.Although the season opener, this was the second story recorded in this block and is the first to go out under the production aegis of Graham Williams. Williams had been brought into the show when Philip Hinchcliffe had moved on after three years at the helm and arguably had taken Doctor Who to new heights and overseen it's most successful period. His reign had been deemed too controversial by the BBC and Hinchcliffe left the show on a ratings and critical high but not with much BBC support. Newcomer Williams had a very different view of the show and seemed to prefer slapstick and whimsy to the darker production style of Hinchcliffe. Williams certainly encouraged the playful side of Tom Baker who never took the role seriously from this point forwards and became more and more outrageous in his performance and dominant of the show. But this was early days and is certainly superior to much of what came later.The restoration of the master tapes is as always flawless, with the earlier story being ""vidfired"" to recreate the original broadcast quality. Both stories have a number of extras included on the disc, most notably two truly interesting retrospectives of Terrance Dicks and the making of The Mind Robber. The commentaries are perhaps not as enjoyable as other releases, particularly for the earlier story featuring Frazer Hines & Hamish Wilson (Jamie), Wendy Padbury (Zoe) and director Michael Ferguson. It must be hard for the crew to recall what is happening almost forty years after the story was made, so this is forgivable, and Dicks, Louise Jameson (Leela) and a guest actor do a good job on the later story. Other extras about the careers of Frazer Hines and Paddy Russell are also quite interesting. The most bizarre inclusion is a sketch from another BBC classic ""The Basil Brush Show"" which seems to have no relevance at all to the Mind Robber or the era, other than it features a Yeti, seen in Doctor Who a year before this release. But it's a silly piece of nonsense that's certainly highly enjoyable.All in all, a good pair of releases, but with only three more Troughton stories in the archives available, I think we'll be looking for more classic Tom Baker releases to fill the gaps in future issues.",5,The Doctor in the land of fiction with a touch of Agatha Christie,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,5728,"['penultimate', 'pair',

On a basic level there is the science fiction story which of course, the BBC wanted to turn into a semi-educational thing so it included the latest scientific developments which were becoming popularised. There are other levels too. Doctor Who was often played in a pseudo-Shakespearian style as part of the BBC remit to bring Drama to the masses. However, one of the great things about the show was the constant trying out of new approaches. This is one of the finest examples of those attempts.Although this appeared in the heady, revolutionary days of 1968, this tendency had always been around in Doctor Who viz. the whole concept of the Daleks in 1964 (when teenagers had not long been invented!). This story is full of surrealism and novelty. At the same time it's central concern with books is a strong signal to young people about the importance of learning in cultural transmission as well as being enjoyable and how easily characters can be brought to life.The ending is a little flat because the 'Master' is found to be a kidnapped English author and of course all of the books are English. This is of minor importance and does not detract from the story. One can only imagine what could be done with such a concept in today's terms with the special effects that are out there.Outstanding.",5,The first Master in a Doctor Who,1025308800,"06 29, 2002",2002,1900,"['excellent', 'story', 'was', 'first', 'transmitted', 'England', 'September', '14', 'October', '12', '1968.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'alluded', 'surreal', 'story', 'set', 'land', 'fiction', 'humorous', 'novel', 'moments', 'finding', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'Jamie', 'blank', 'face', 'Doctor', 'facial', 'feature', 'nearby', 'blank', 'face', 'different', 'looking', 'Jamie', 'while', 'when', 'Jamie', 'up', 'atree', 'wierd', 'forest', 'discover', 'forest', 'actually', 'made', 'words', 'fascination', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'always', 'been', 'combination', 'things', 'basic', 'level', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'course', 'BBC', 'wanted', 'turn', 'semi-educational', 'thing', 'included', 'latest', 'scientific', 'developments', 'were', 'becoming', 'popularised', 'are', 'other', 'levels', 'too', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'was', 'often', 'played', 'pseudo-Shakespearian', 'style', 'part', 'BBC', 'remit', 'bring', 'Drama', 'masses', 'However', 'one', 'great', 'things', 'show', 'was', 'constant', 'trying', 'new', 'approaches', 'one', 'finest', 'examples', 'appeared', 'heady', 'revolutionary', 'days', '1968', 'tendency', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'viz', 'whole', 'concept', 'Daleks', '1964', 'when', 'teenagers', 'had', 'not', 'long', 'been', 'invented', 'story', 'full', 'surrealism', 'novelty', 'same', 'time', 'central', 'concern', 'books', 'strong', 'signal', 'young', 'people', 'importance', 'learning', 'cultural', 'transmission', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'enjoyable', 'how', 'easily', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'brought', 'life.The', 'ending', 'little', 'flat', ""'Master"", 'found', 'be', 'kidnapped', 'English', 'author', 'course', 'books', 'are', 'English', 'minor', 'importance', 'not', 'detract', 'story', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'concept', 'today', 'terms', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'out', 'there.Outstanding']",Doctor Who - The Mind Robber VHS
349613,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,6302993628,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[5, 5]","Growing up, I viewed very few of Patrick Troughton's adventures as the Doctor.  For this reason, he was always an afterthought in my little ""Who"" world.  After watching a number of his tales, however, he's quickly become one of my favorite incarnations of the good Doctor.  I love his rapport with his companions and anybody else who happens to stumble on to the wobbly sets of ""Doctor Who.""  In this particular adventure, he really shines, making me rank ""The Mind Robber"" as one of the best ""Who"" serials in the entire series' long run.  It starts out with the Doctor, Jamie (Frazer Hines) and Zoe (Wendy Padbury) in a TARDIS that's about to be engulfed by molten lava.  With no real idea as to what will happen to the TARDIS in this state, the Doctor (with a little help from Jamie) executes an emergency exit feature on the TARDIS' console.  Where they end up is nowhere, literally.  They are out of reality, time and space altogether.  Jamie has visions of his home, Scotland.  Zoe sees the city she was raised in.  Zoe, against the Doctor's orders, leaves the safety of the TARDIS to see her home.  What she finds is a void that shows her what she wants to see.  Jamie goes to save her and gets caught up into the visions as well.  Once the Doctor seemingly saves them, all three end up trapped in a world where fiction is reality and riddles help you find your way home.  Who or what is behind this ""nothing"" that has the trio trapped?  Can the Doctor save them?  You'll have to watch to find out.This tale features some wonderful characters from literature.  From Gulliver to Rapunzel to D'Artagnan, history's best stories get a nod in this engaging adventure written primarily by Peter Ling, who we find from viewing the retrospective, ""Fact Of Fiction,"" questioned his own ability to write science fiction.This story seemed doomed from the beginning.  Due to unforeseen circumstances, Episode One was thrown together to stretch the adventure into five episodes.  It's actually one of the highlights of the story.  Also, when Frazer Hines became ill, another actor was cast to portray him in one of the episodes.  What's great about this is the rather funny way that a different looking Jamie came to be.  Spare robots from a previous BBC production were used as well.  This story is a shining example of chaos becoming classic.As far as the actual disc is concerned, the crew at the BBC have outdone themselves once again.  This is an excellent DVD transfer with only a few blemishes visible throughout the episodes.  The audio is wonderful as well.  As with the other classic ""Doctor Who"" DVDs, this one is chock full of special features.  Including the aforementioned retrospective, there's also ""Highlander,"" which looks at the career of the highly likeable Frazer Hines.  There's a fun ""Basil Brush"" sketch featuring the dapper fox and his run-in with the Yeti, a photo gallery, a ""Who's Who"" gallery, excellent audio commentary and an easter egg as well.This is a great ""Doctor Who"" tale and I highly recommend it to any and every fan of the classic series, the new series or science fiction in general.  Fans of mysteries and thrillers may also like this story.  It's got a fresh and different (for ""Doctor Who"") story, an excellent cast, a solid villain who shares his name with another, legendary arch-villain of the Doctor and even a little bit of classic literature education.  It's simply wonderful.  Highly recommended.And one other completely chauvinist note:  Although the Doctor has had his share of beautiful companions, I must admit that few of them have ever looked as smokin' hot as Wendy Padbury as Zoe in this particular adventure.",5,Top-Notch Troughton And Company,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,3662,"['Growing', 'up', 'viewed', 'very', 'few', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'adventures', 'Doctor', 'reason', 'was', 'always', 'afterthought', 'little', 'Who', 'world', 'watching', 'number', 'tales', 'however', 'quickly', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'incarnations', 'good', 'Doctor', 'love', 'rapport', 'companions', 'anybody', 'else', 'who', 'stumble', 'wobbly', 'sets', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'particular', 'adventure', 'really', 'making', 'rank', 'Mind', 'Robber', 'one', 'best', 'Who', 'serials', 'entire', 'series', 'long', 'run', 'out', 'Doctor', 'Jamie', 'Frazer', 'Hines', 'Zoe', 'Wendy', 'Padbury', 'TARDIS', 'be', 'engulfed', 'molten', 'lava', 'real', 'idea', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'TARDIS', 'state', 'Doctor', 'little', 'help', 'Jamie', 'emergency', 'exit', 'feature', 'TARDIS', 'console', 'Where', 'end', 'up', 'nowhere', 'literally', 'are', 'reality', 'time', 'space', 'altogether', 'Jamie', 'visions', 'home', 'Scotland', 'Zoe', 'city', 'was', 'raised', 'Zoe', 'Doctor', 'orders', 'safety', 'TARDIS', 'see', 'home', 'What', 'void', 'what', 'see', 'Jamie', 'save', 'caught', 'up', 'visions', 'well', 'Doctor', 'seemingly', 'three', 'end', 'up', 'trapped', 'world', 'where', 'fiction', 'reality', 'riddles', 'help', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'Who', 'what', 'nothing', 'trio', 'trapped', 'Can', 'Doctor', 'save', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out.This', 'tale', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'literature', 'Gulliver', 'Rapunzel', ""D'Artagnan"", 'history', 'best', 'stories', 'get', 'nod', 'engaging', 'adventure', 'written', 'primarily', 'Peter', 'Ling', 'who', 'find', 'viewing', 'retrospective', 'Fact', 'Fiction', 'questioned', 'own', 'ability', 'write', 'science', 'fiction.This', 'story', 'seemed', 'doomed', 'beginning', 'Due', 'unforeseen', 'circumstances', 'Episode', 'One', 'was', 'thrown', 'together', 'stretch', 'adventure', 'five', 'episodes', 'actually', 'one', 'highlights', 'story', 'Also', 'when', 'Frazer', 'Hines', 'became', 'ill', 'actor', 'was', 'cast', 'portray', 'one', 'episodes', 'What', 'great', 'rather', 'funny', 'way', 'different', 'looking', 'Jamie', 'came', 'be', 'Spare', 'robots', 'previous', 'BBC', 'production', 'were', 'used', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'shining', 'example', 'chaos', 'becoming', 'classic.As', 'far', 'actual', 'disc', 'concerned', 'crew', 'BBC', 'have', 'outdone', 'once', 'again', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'only', 'few', 'blemishes', 'visible', 'episodes', 'audio', 'wonderful', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'classic', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'DVDs', 'one', 'chock', 'full', 'special', 'features', 'Including', 'aforementioned', 'retrospective', 'also', 'Highlander', 'career', 'highly', 'likeable', 'Frazer', 'Hines', 'fun', 'Basil', 'Brush', 'sketch', 'featuring', 'dapper', 'fox', 'run-in', 'Yeti', 'photo', 'gallery', 'Who', 'Who', 'gallery', 'excellent', 'audio', 'commentary', 'easter', 'egg', 'well.This', 'great', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'tale', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fan', 'classic', 'series', 'new', 'series', 'science', 'fiction', 'general', 'Fans', 'mysteries', 'thrillers', 'may', 'also', 'like', 'story', 'got', 'fresh', 'different', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'story', 'excellent', 'cast', 'solid', 'villain', 'who', 'shares', 'name', 'legendary', 'arch-villain', 'Doctor', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'classic', 'literature', 'education', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'Highly', 'recommended.And', 'one', 'other', 'completely', 'chauvinist', 'note', 'Doctor', 'had', 'share', 'beautiful', 'companions', 'must', 'admit', 'few', 'have', 'ever', 'looked', 'smokin', 'hot', 'Wendy', 'Padbury', 'Zoe', 'particular', 'adventure']",Doctor Who - The Mind Robber VHS

I read that most helpful review by buckbooks before buying this that explained the reason why the first episode felt like filler, but that doesn't excuse how stupid the companions were for wandering off into the void.  Apart from that it was okay, the ending with the TARDIS breaking up was the best part.  The next 2 episodes were truly good, except for one thing: the cowardly Second Doctor.  Seriously, every threat he was faced with he responded with panic.  It got annoying after a while.  If he is like this in his other episodes, he's probably going to be my least favorite Doctor.  I did come to like Jamie though, but Zoe was annoying as proved in the next episode when she activated that alarm (my aunt, who was watching it with me said ""Leela would never do that!"").  Even when she was taking down the Karkus (her best moment here), it was still annoying because the Doctor was cowering from him while she fought him.  I thought to myself ""the Third Doctor would have fought him, smiling.""  Even the Doctor grabs the idiot ball in the last episode when he falls for the trap the villain set for him.  Apart from those somewhat significant annoyances, this was good.  The fictional characters were perfectly cast, and I really liked the riddles & puns.

Even though Peter Ling (the author) didn't write this episode, as it was a last minute addition, it has to be the best of the five. A subtly creepy opening as The Doctor is forced to take the TARDIS out of time, space and reality, in order to escape being smothered by a volcano (from the previous adventure), and a mysterious voice inside their heads beckoning them to come out... but where do you go when there's... nothing?The next four episodes are no slouch either. ""Out there"" is a land of fiction, characters from books such as Gullivers Travels and Rapunzel, but even creatures from mythology, Medusa, unicorns, etc. How do you escape Medusa? How do you escape a stampeding unicorn? When it doesn't exist?And I don't want to hear any more talk about Rose being a revolutionary companion who ""doesn't just scream."" The new series was NOT the first to have a proactive companion who wasn't a cardboard cutout. Zoe is fantastic in this, taking down a futuristic superhero (Karkus) that she read about in her own time, and even saving the day as she destroys the computer controlling the fiction world.An easy recommend. Patrick Troughton seems incapable of having a bad serial, and it's not just due to the writers.

More than a touch up, the print here seems to be a complete reworking and rebuilding from the ground up.  It's better than first broadcast, better than DVD - it's almost as good as being right there on the set... perhaps even better.  Flaws, gaps, cracks, peeling paint, zippers, wigs and all seem more obvious than ever before.  It can actually take you out of the moment - but you never lose focus.I just wish the same could be said of the story.  THE MIND ROBBER is a famous bit of DOCTOR WHO for it's first episode.  It's a slice of the surreal featuring just the principal cast, the TARDIS and a white set with white robots all of which ends with a bang - the destruction of the TARDIS itself. While clever, it's not the first time the series has done this.  THE EDGE OF DESTRUCTION, the third story in Hartnell's years, was another TARDIS bound story featuring some surprising tension, violence and horror.The rest of the story is highlighted with touches and moments that help to keep the story moving till the end (when the story does just that - ends, almost suddenly, without warning) - as well as another first for the series, the replacement of Frazer Hines (Jamie) with Hamish Wilson (Jamie), as Hines became ill during production and instead of just writing Jamie out, hired on Wilson at the last moment and wrote him into the story with a clever and witty twist.This disc comes feature packed like the rest, but unlike the rest, a lot of the information here is repeated again and again.  Commentary is included, and while not as fast, furious and funny as other Hines commentary (his comments on THE TWO DOCTORS with Baker and Bryant are very funny), they do manage to come up with some good memories and personal asides that help to sell it.  There's also included a very suspect and odd BASIL BRUSH segment which features a YETI from DOCTOR WHO played for laughs - it's a very compelling, yet strange piece of DOCTOR WHO history that feels exactly like the padding that it is.  There are no YETI in THE MIND ROBBER, so it seems odd to include it with this story.  It simply there to mark time.THE MIND ROBBER may not make anyone's top ten list of DOCTOR WHO stories, but it does feature several original twists and turns brought on by limited time, illness and budget problems that help to make a keeper.",3,VODKA & TONIC,1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,2441,"['One', 'first', 'things', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'when', 'start', 'THE', 'MIND', 'ROBBER', 'just', 'how', 'CLEAN', 'CLEAR', 'image', 'More', 'touch', 'up', 'print', 'here', 'be', 'complete', 'reworking', 'rebuilding', 'ground', 'up', 'better', 'first', 'broadcast', 'better', 'DVD', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'being', 'right', 'there', 'set', 'perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'Flaws', 'gaps', 'cracks', 'peeling', 'paint', 'zippers', 'wigs', 'seem', 'more', 'obvious', 'ever', 'can', 'actually', 'take', 'moment', 'never', 'lose', 'focus.I', 'just', 'wish', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'story', 'MIND', 'ROBBER', 'famous', 'bit', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'first', 'episode', 'slice', 'surreal', 'featuring', 'just', 'principal', 'cast', 'TARDIS', 'white', 'set', 'white', 'robots', 'bang', 'destruction', 'TARDIS', 'clever', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'series', 'done', 'EDGE', 'OF', 'DESTRUCTION', 'third', 'story', 'Hartnell', 'years', 'was', 'TARDIS', 'bound', 'story', 'featuring', 'surprising', 'tension', 'violence', 'horror.The', 'rest', 'story', 'highlighted', 'touches', 'moments', 'help', 'keep', 'story', 'moving', 'end', 'when', 'story', 'just', 'ends', 'almost', 'suddenly', 'warning', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'series', 'replacement', 'Frazer', 'Hines', 'Jamie', 'Hamish', 'Wilson', 'Jamie', 'Hines', 'became', 'ill', 'production', 'instead', 'just', 'writing', 'Jamie', 'out', 'hired', 'Wilson', 'last', 'moment', 'wrote', 'story', 'clever', 'witty', 'twist.This', 'disc', 'feature', 'packed', 'rest', 'rest', 'lot', 'information', 'here', 'repeated', 'again', 'again', 'Commentary', 'included', 'while', 'not', 'fast', 'furious', 'funny', 'other', 'Hines', 'commentary', 'comments', 'TWO', 'DOCTORS', 'Baker', 'Bryant', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'do', 'manage', 'come', 'up', 'good', 'memories', 'personal', 'asides', 'help', 'sell', 'also', 'included', 'very', 'suspect', 'odd', 'BASIL', 'BRUSH', 'segment', 'YETI', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'played', 'laughs', 'very', 'compelling', 'yet', 'strange', 'piece', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'history', 'exactly', 'padding', 'are', 'YETI', 'THE', 'MIND', 'ROBBER', 'odd', 'include', 'story', 'simply', 'mark', 'time.THE', 'MIND', 'ROBBER', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'anyone', 'top', 'ten', 'list', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'feature', 'several', 'original', 'twists', 'turns', 'brought', 'limited', 'time', 'illness', 'budget', 'problems', 'help', 'make', 'keeper']",Doctor Who - The Mind Robber VHS
