982473,AIWDJ3S85O10Q,B000F48D14,Edward Aycock,"[10, 12]","You can try and emulate this show but it would be hard.  Rarely have seven actors (eight now as Mary Birdsong joins after a few episodes, evening out the man-woman ratio) been able to create such vivid characters that are funny and pathetic and yet never cross over the line into stupidity.  The chemistry among all the leads is amazing and no matter who they're paired up with, they pull it off every time.Season Three begins with the conclusion of the story arc from Season Two.  The cops are now in jail, in tight quarters and driving one another nuts.  Once that storyline is resolved, they're back on the beat.  Dangle meets a young man who could be his son and that's bad for Dangle -- because he's desperately attracted to the young man.  Jones enjoys a brief moment in the spotlight as a voiceover artist.  Garcia refuses to introduce the cops to a mystery woman, so of course they all spy on him.  A children's TV host tries to do a show on location and it all goes very, very wrong.  The scene with Junior rescuing a cat from a roof is one that seems pretty standard at first;  we know something will go wrong (things ALWAYS go wrong with Junior), just not what.  However, what does happen is so horrifying yet so blasted funny that you'll be staring at your TV set in disbelief while laughing so hard you can't breathe.Thankfully Season Three, like Season Two, is uncensored and it's amazing what a world of difference that makes.  All the bleeping from TV can make a scene seem disjointed, and I never thought I'd say this, but the profanity makes every situation funnier.  Also, the more you watch an episode, the more you can pick up on the asides, and the off-the-cuff comments that enrich each scene even more.I think the secret to what makes Reno so good is that while the characters and situations are nuts, there's something very real about the Reno cops.  They live in substandard housing, they smoke, they drink, are unlucky in life and love, and they try to find their happiness wherever they can.  This is illustrated in the scene when Jones tells Junior what he would do if he had two million dollars, that he'd tell off his family and when Junior asks him why he doesn't do that now, Jones states it's because his family is supporting him.  Another scene shows the cops at the end of their shift, sitting on the front lawn of the station, smoking and making small talk and I got the impression they really didn't have anywhere else to go. (Not one of the characters is married, oddly enough.) I think if the actors played these characters straight, it would be too sad for words.  They don't have much going for them, and it's only their job that gives them authority and power that they want.  God love 'em. You may not want Dangle, Weigel, Jones and the gang in your precinct but there's no denying they're the funniest cops you'll see.",5,That's how they do it in Reno,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,2863,"['can', 'try', 'emulate', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'Rarely', 'have', 'seven', 'actors', 'eight', 'now', 'Mary', 'Birdsong', 'few', 'episodes', 'evening', 'out', 'man-woman', 'ratio', 'been', 'able', 'create', 'such', 'vivid', 'characters', 'are', 'funny', 'pathetic', 'yet', 'never', 'cross', 'line', 'stupidity', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'amazing', 'matter', 'who', ""'re"", 'paired', 'up', 'pull', 'off', 'time.Season', 'Three', 'conclusion', 'story', 'arc', 'Season', 'Two', 'cops', 'are', 'now', 'jail', 'tight', 'quarters', 'driving', 'one', 'nuts', 'Once', 'storyline', 'resolved', ""'re"", 'back', 'beat', 'Dangle', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'son', 'bad', 'Dangle', 'desperately', 'attracted', 'young', 'man', 'Jones', 'brief', 'moment', 'spotlight', 'voiceover', 'artist', 'Garcia', 'introduce', 'cops', 'mystery', 'woman', 'course', 'spy', 'children', 'TV', 'host', 'tries', 'do', 'show', 'location', 'very', 'very', 'wrong', 'scene', 'Junior', 'rescuing', 'cat', 'roof', 'one', 'pretty', 'standard', 'first', 'know', 'something', 'will', 'go', 'wrong', 'things', 'ALWAYS', 'go', 'wrong', 'Junior', 'just', 'not', 'what', 'However', 'what', 'happen', 'so', 'horrifying', 'yet', 'so', 'blasted', 'funny', ""'ll"", 'be', 'staring', 'TV', 'set', 'disbelief', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'breathe.Thankfully', 'Season', 'Three', 'Season', 'Two', 'uncensored', 'amazing', 'what', 'world', 'difference', 'bleeping', 'TV', 'can', 'make', 'scene', 'seem', 'disjointed', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'say', 'profanity', 'situation', 'funnier', 'Also', 'more', 'watch', 'episode', 'more', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'asides', 'off-the-cuff', 'comments', 'enrich', 'scene', 'even', 'more.I', 'think', 'secret', 'what', 'Reno', 'so', 'good', 'characters', 'situations', 'are', 'nuts', 'something', 'very', 'real', 'Reno', 'cops', 'live', 'substandard', 'housing', 'smoke', 'drink', 'are', 'unlucky', 'life', 'love', 'try', 'find', 'happiness', 'can', 'illustrated', 'scene', 'when', 'Jones', 'Junior', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'had', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', ""'d"", 'tell', 'off', 'family', 'when', 'Junior', 'why', ""n't"", 'do', 'now', 'Jones', 'family', 'supporting', 'scene', 'cops', 'end', 'shift', 'sitting', 'front', 'lawn', 'station', 'smoking', 'making', 'small', 'talk', 'got', 'impression', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anywhere', 'else', 'go', 'Not', 'one', 'characters', 'married', 'oddly', 'enough', 'think', 'actors', 'played', 'characters', 'straight', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'sad', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'going', 'only', 'job', 'authority', 'power', 'want', 'God', 'love', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'Dangle', 'Weigel', 'Jones', 'gang', 'precinct', 'denying', ""'re"", 'funniest', 'cops', ""'ll"", 'see']",N/A

Some of the jokes from earlier seasons are repeated here, but I noticed an even raunchier vibe to this show's third outing.  My favorite episode is Episode 4 featuring Reading Ron, a Mr. Rogers knock-off.  Nonstop laughs in that one.  And this season introduces a new deputy portrayed by Mary Birdsong.  She is just getting her footing and I hope the series capitalizes on the new character in the future, because right now she seems overshadowed by the current cast.  Highlights include the Reno team serving as security for a location shoot of ""CSI:  Las Vegas"".  Let's just say they are not entirely inaccurate portraying ""Hollywood"" types as cynical and uncaring.  And the introduction of a character who might be Dangle's long-lost son is great humorous fodder.  Finally, Liberace's piano skit is hysterical.  So, keep up the great work, Reno Sheriff's Department.  Here's to many more adventures!  Keep 'em coming!

982483,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000F48D14,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Reno 911! is a hilarious mockumentary-style spoof of a ""Cops"" reality show; the acting is superb and I couldn't stop laughing! They keep the action going; I wasn't ever bored and they even went through the trouble of filming some of the scenes in a real working police substation in Carson, California! These are great performances with minimally scripted material; much of this is improvised with actors making up their lines as they go along. There is Cedric Yarbrough as Deputy Jones who is forever trying to be the ultimate ladies' man; Niecy Nash as Deputy Raineesha Williams, a remarkably curvaceous cop with an attitude; Robert Ben Garant as Deputy Travis Junior who is something of a redneck; Thomas Lennon as flamboyantly gay (but usually in denial) Lieutenant Jim Dangle; Kerri Kenney as manic depressive, racist sociopath Deputy Trudy Wiegel; Carlos Alazraqui as Deputy James Garcia who has his own racial attitudes; Wendi McLendon-Covey as loose woman Deputy Clementine Johnson and, in season three, Mary Birdsong as a newcomer to the force , the somewhat closeted ""I Am Not a Lesbian"" Deputy Cherisha Kimball.I don't want to spoil things for you, so I'll just mention a fraction of what happens. The season begins with the force still in jail; but they are released after a most unexpected turn of events! You'd think their problems would be over as they rebuild their lives but that won't be quite so easy. Look also for what happens when Garcia has a mystery lady friend in his life--the other cops are shocked he's never mentioned her especially when everything indicates that he's going to marry her! In another particularly well done episode that many reviewers have mentioned, Jones has his big ""show biz"" break when he does a voice-over for a commercial; Jones dreams of being able to tell the other cops where to go and we see how that all plays out.In addition, Deputy Wiegel decides to marry Craig, the ""Truckee River"" serial killer; and how Deputy Williams and the other deputies prepare for such an oddball wedding makes for very funny and unexpected situations. There's a major SARS scare for Wiegel, Jones and Dangle while other sidesplitting episodes show the Sheriff's Department getting a new Humvee cruiser and what happens when Deputies Williams and Garcia are responsible for guarding Liberace's piano.The two DVD set comes with bonus features; we get ""extended outtakes from the `cart-jacking' and the set of CSI"" and ""action figure promos."" There are even more extended outtakes and some of the episodes offer an optional running commentary that really made me laugh!Reno 911! had a great third season and any fan of this series should get this two DVD set. The episodes are uncensored which makes them even funnier! I agree with the reviewer who writes that these people are people we can relate to in one way or another; but I also think that the fact that these cops are such ""clown-like"" characters with their sometimes silly physical appearances and often strange behavior makes this an outstanding comedy series.",5,"""Once again, misfortune has humped my leg."" -- Deputy Clementine Johnson",1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,3053,"['911', 'hilarious', 'mockumentary-style', 'spoof', 'Cops', 'reality', 'show', 'acting', 'superb', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'keep', 'action', 'going', 'was', ""n't"", 'ever', 'bored', 'even', 'went', 'trouble', 'filming', 'scenes', 'real', 'working', 'police', 'substation', 'Carson', 'California', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'minimally', 'scripted', 'material', 'much', 'improvised', 'actors', 'making', 'up', 'lines', 'go', 'along', 'Cedric', 'Yarbrough', 'Deputy', 'Jones', 'who', 'forever', 'trying', 'be', 'ultimate', 'ladies', 'man', 'Niecy', 'Nash', 'Deputy', 'Raineesha', 'Williams', 'remarkably', 'curvaceous', 'cop', 'attitude', 'Robert', 'Ben', 'Garant', 'Deputy', 'Travis', 'Junior', 'who', 'something', 'redneck', 'Thomas', 'Lennon', 'flamboyantly', 'gay', 'usually', 'denial', 'Lieutenant', 'Jim', 'Dangle', 'Kerri', 'Kenney', 'manic', 'depressive', 'racist', 'sociopath', 'Deputy', 'Trudy', 'Wiegel', 'Carlos', 'Alazraqui', 'Deputy', 'James', 'Garcia', 'who', 'own', 'racial', 'attitudes', 'Wendi', 'McLendon-Covey', 'loose', 'woman', 'Deputy', 'Clementine', 'Johnson', 'season', 'three', 'Mary', 'Birdsong', 'newcomer', 'force', 'somewhat', 'closeted', 'Am', 'Not', 'Lesbian', 'Deputy', 'Cherisha', 'Kimball.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'things', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'mention', 'fraction', 'what', 'season', 'force', 'still', 'jail', 'are', 'released', 'most', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'events', ""'d"", 'think', 'problems', 'would', 'be', 'rebuild', 'lives', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'quite', 'so', 'easy', 'Look', 'also', 'what', 'when', 'Garcia', 'mystery', 'lady', 'friend', 'life', 'other', 'cops', 'are', 'shocked', 'never', 'mentioned', 'especially', 'when', 'everything', 'going', 'marry', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'episode', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Jones', 'big', 'show', 'biz', 'break', 'when', 'voice-over', 'commercial', 'Jones', 'dreams', 'being', 'able', 'tell', 'other', 'cops', 'where', 'go', 'see', 'how', 'plays', 'out.In', 'addition', 'Deputy', 'Wiegel', 'marry', 'Craig', 'Truckee', 'River', 'serial', 'killer', 'how', 'Deputy', 'Williams', 'other', 'deputies', 'prepare', 'oddball', 'wedding', 'very', 'funny', 'unexpected', 'situations', 'major', 'SARS', 'scare', 'Wiegel', 'Jones', 'Dangle', 'other', 'sidesplitting', 'episodes', 'show', 'Sheriff', 'Department', 'getting', 'new', 'Humvee', 'cruiser', 'what', 'when', 'Deputies', 'Williams', 'Garcia', 'are', 'responsible', 'guarding', 'Liberace', 'piano.The', 'two', 'DVD', 'set', 'bonus', 'features', 'get', 'extended', 'outtakes', 'cart-jacking', 'set', 'CSI', 'action', 'figure', 'promos', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'extended', 'outtakes', 'episodes', 'offer', 'optional', 'running', 'commentary', 'really', 'made', 'Reno', '911', 'had', 'great', 'third', 'season', 'fan', 'series', 'should', 'get', 'two', 'DVD', 'set', 'episodes', 'are', 'uncensored', 'even', 'funnier', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'way', 'also', 'think', 'fact', 'cops', 'are', 'such', 'clown-like', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'silly', 'physical', 'appearances', 'often', 'strange', 'behavior', 'outstanding', 'comedy', 'series']",N/A

Deputy James Garcia's sister almost gets married, except for the fact that her fianc&eacute;e is run out of town.  Deputy Clementine Johnson's marriage to the Hot Tub King of Reno isn't considered legal, because he hadn't divorced his current wife.  Also, just before the wedding ceremony took place, he died!

982485,A1K9IW99EFBZ52,B000F48D14,Mike,"[3, 3]","The 7th episode of the season features a series-best performance from Cedric Yarborough as Jones, who gains instant fame as the voice-over talent for High Sierra Carpets. The series is based on characters who have varying degrees of insanity and instability (but for the most part let those traits bubble just below the surface). In this episode, however, Yarborough gives an unrestrained, over-the-top tour de force performance. Deputy Jones proves that the higher they climb, the harder they fall, and the episode is laugh-out-loud hilarious. The fun doesn't stop there...the season starts with the entire cast in jail (picking up from season 2), moves toward their inevitable showdown with former D.A. (and part-time serial killer) Mike Powers, and much, much more. The eleventh episode...with the officers performing security duty on the set of ""CSI""...features some of their best extended improv to date. The scene with Dangle and Junior guarding ""M. Helgenberger's"" trailer just keeps getting crazier and crazier. Apparently he REALLY wanted that towel! This is ensemble comedy at its finest.",5,"""I'm a TURTLE now!

982487,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B000F48D14,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[0, 0]","At first I was disappointed in season three of Reno 911.  I missed the second season, so I did not know about the cliffhanger with D.A. Mike Powers out to get the sheriff's department fired, so the first two episodes of this season seemed very weird.  On second and third viewings, however, I see how funny those episodes were and, with most of the episodes on here (save for two near the end) being hilarious, this DVD set is one of my favorites.  The acting, as usual, is superb!Disc 1:Episode 1:  After D.A. Mike Powers gets the brave men and women of the Reno Sheriff's Department put behind bars, Powers is discovered to be a murderer (well, he decapitated a few prostitutes) and the objects of his hatred are released from prison to pursue lives outside the force.  They all find new careers that fit their personalities.Episode 2:  The gang is out of prison and doing what they want:  Junior is a sleazy carney, Clemmy is a Steely Dan groupie, Dangle is trying out for American Idol, Wiegel is opening her home to old shut-ins, etc.  Happy with their new lives, the gang doesn't care about getting back at the guy who got them fired, but Mike Powers is obsessed on getting ultimate revenge on the former officers.  Junior:  ""Everybody does bad stuff; I love child p*rn*graphy, who am I to throw stones.""Episode 3:  The Sheriff's Department is trying out new candidates to be the new member of their force, but they don't want to hire someone who makes them look TOO bad.  As Raineesha says, ""If I wasn't on my period, I could have did that.""Episode 4:  One of my favorites.  Reading Ron films his PBS children's reading program at the Reno Sheriff's Department, but can't find any usable footage for the show and confronts some past demons.  I've laughed to tears during this episode.  Junior: ""Ecstasy does not start with an 'X'."" In the meantime, Dangle, Jonesy, and Wiegel are quarantined for Saars.Episode 5:  The gang is trying to catch the notorious Fast Eddie McLintock (Jeff Foxworthy gets voice credit).  The spike strip scene is hilarious.  I laughed to tears during the scene with the interpretor and the suspected jewel thief when Garcia goes off!  The graffiti song at the school is also a highlight.Episode 6:  I love the beginning scene with the stripper accidentally hanging himself at Clemmy's birthday party!  Dangle and Kimball escort a visiting dignitary from New Zealand.  Wiegel and Junior try to recruit at a job fair.Episode 7:  Jones sings on a radio commercial and thinks he's going to be a star.  Dangle and Wiegel try to unravel a baffling Arby's murder case.  Garcia and Junior are ambushed by paint ballers.Disc 2:Episode 8:  This is my favorite episode of this season.  Excellent beginning scene where a liver transplant needs to be delivered to St. Mary's Hospital--with Trudy Wiegel in charge!  Williams and Garcia guard Liberace's piano which seems to be cursed.  Clemmy gets engaged to a 74 year-old hot tub king who dies after the proposal.  Luckily, Clemmy has always wanted to be a widow.  Will she be a rich widow or will misfortune h*mp her leg?Episode 9:  It's Garcia's birthday but he has plans...with a woman.  The gang follows him around and finds out there is a wedding being planned but also find what they believe to be evidence the woman is two-timing him.Episode 10:  The Sheriff's Department gets a Hummer which may be more trouble than it's worth (although Clemmy thinks she looks da*n good in it).  A good-looking Hawaiian lad thinks he's found his father--Lt. Jim Dangle.Episode 11:  CSI is filming in Reno and the Sheriff's Department works security.  This episode is surprisingly boring--even Clemmy cries!Episode 12:  Dangle and Junior stake out a spa and end up having to find their way back to the station--in the buff.  As good as those guys look (and they look GOOOOOOD--all the guys in this show are hot), this episode is another clunker.Episode 13:  Hooray!  The show gets back on track!  Wiegel is proposed to by her convicted murderer boyfriend who is set to be executed in 24 hours.  In a rare moment of compassion, the gang do what they can to make her wedding one to remember. Includes cliffhanger when the red phone rings.",5,"""If I wasn't on my period, I could have did that.""---Raineesha Williams",1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,4197,"['first', 'was', 'disappointed', 'season', 'three', 'Reno', '911', 'missed', 'second', 'season', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'cliffhanger', 'D.A', 'Mike', 'Powers', 'out', 'get', 'sheriff', 'department', 'fired', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', 'seemed', 'very', 'weird', 'second', 'third', 'viewings', 'however', 'see', 'how', 'funny', 'episodes', 'were', 'most', 'episodes', 'here', 'save', 'two', 'end', 'being', 'hilarious', 'DVD', 'set', 'one', 'favorites', 'acting', 'usual', 'superb', '1', 'Episode', '1', 'D.A', 'Mike', 'Powers', 'brave', 'men', 'women', 'Reno', 'Sheriff', 'Department', 'put', 'bars', 'Powers', 'discovered', 'be', 'murderer', 'well', 'decapitated', 'few', 'prostitutes', 'objects', 'hatred', 'are', 'released', 'prison', 'pursue', 'lives', 'force', 'find', 'new', 'careers', 'fit', 'personalities.Episode', '2', 'gang', 'prison', 'doing', 'what', 'want', 'Junior', 'sleazy', 'carney', 'Clemmy', 'Steely', 'Dan', 'groupie', 'Dangle', 'trying', 'out', 'American', 'Idol', 'Wiegel', 'opening', 'home', 'old', 'shut-ins', 'etc', 'Happy', 'new', 'lives', 'gang', ""n't"", 'care', 'getting', 'back', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'fired', 'Mike', 'Powers', 'obsessed', 'getting', 'ultimate', 'revenge', 'former', 'officers', 'Junior', 'Everybody', 'bad', 'stuff', 'love', 'child', 'p*rn*graphy', 'who', 'am', 'throw', 'stones', 'Episode', '3', 'Sheriff', 'Department', 'trying', 'out', 'new', 'candidates', 'be', 'new', 'member', 'force', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hire', 'someone', 'who', 'look', 'TOO', 'bad', 'Raineesha', 'was', ""n't"", 'period', 'could', 'have', 'did', 'Episode', '4', 'One', 'favorites', 'Reading', 'Ron', 'films', 'PBS', 'children', 'reading', 'program', 'Reno', 'Sheriff', 'Department', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'usable', 'footage', 'show', 'past', 'demons', ""'ve"", 'laughed', 'tears', 'episode', 'Junior', 'Ecstasy', 'not', 'start', 'X', 'meantime', 'Dangle', 'Jonesy', 'Wiegel', 'are', 'quarantined', 'Saars.Episode', '5', 'gang', 'trying', 'catch', 'notorious', 'Fast', 'Eddie', 'McLintock', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'voice', 'credit', 'spike', 'strip', 'scene', 'hilarious', 'laughed', 'tears', 'scene', 'interpretor', 'suspected', 'jewel', 'thief', 'when', 'Garcia', 'off', 'graffiti', 'song', 'school', 'also', 'highlight.Episode', '6', 'love', 'beginning', 'scene', 'stripper', 'accidentally', 'hanging', 'Clemmy', 'birthday', 'party', 'Dangle', 'Kimball', 'escort', 'visiting', 'dignitary', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Wiegel', 'Junior', 'try', 'recruit', 'job', 'fair.Episode', '7', 'Jones', 'sings', 'radio', 'commercial', 'going', 'be', 'star', 'Dangle', 'Wiegel', 'try', 'unravel', 'baffling', 'Arby', 'murder', 'case', 'Garcia', 'Junior', 'are', 'ambushed', 'paint', 'ballers.Disc', '2', 'Episode', '8', 'favorite', 'episode', 'season', 'Excellent', 'beginning', 'scene', 'where', 'liver', 'transplant', 'be', 'delivered', 'St.', 'Mary', 'Hospital', 'Trudy', 'Wiegel', 'charge', 'Williams', 'Garcia', 'guard', 'Liberace', 'piano', 'be', 'cursed', 'Clemmy', 'engaged', '74', 'year-old', 'hot', 'tub', 'king', 'who', 'proposal', 'Luckily', 'Clemmy', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'widow', 'Will', 'be', 'rich', 'widow', 'will', 'misfortune', 'h*mp', 'leg', 'Episode', '9', 'Garcia', 'birthday', 'plans', 'woman', 'gang', 'around', 'out', 'wedding', 'being', 'planned', 'also', 'find', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'evidence', 'woman', 'two-timing', 'him.Episode', '10', 'Sheriff', 'Department', 'Hummer', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'trouble', 'worth', 'Clemmy', 'da*n', 'good', 'good-looking', 'Hawaiian', 'lad', 'found', 'father', 'Lt.', 'Jim', 'Dangle.Episode', '11', 'CSI', 'filming', 'Reno', 'Sheriff', 'Department', 'security', 'episode', 'surprisingly', 'boring', 'even', 'Clemmy', 'cries', 'Episode', '12', 'Dangle', 'Junior', 'stake', 'out', 'spa', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'station', 'buff', 'As', 'good', 'guys', 'look', 'look', 'GOOOOOOD', 'guys', 'show', 'are', 'hot', 'episode', 'clunker.Episode', '13', 'Hooray', 'show', 'back', 'track', 'Wiegel', 'proposed', 'convicted', 'murderer', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'set', 'be', 'executed', '24', 'hours', 'rare', 'moment', 'compassion', 'gang', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'make', 'wedding', 'one', 'remember', 'Includes', 'cliffhanger', 'when', 'red', 'phone', 'rings']",N/A

As the third season of the show opens, the inept officers of the Reno, Nevada sheriff's department are freed from prison and leading new lives, only to be re-united again and eventually re-instated as cops, much to their dismay.  The improvised jokes and gags come as fast and furious as a long time fan of the show would come to expect, yet pretty much everything here still manages to feel fresh.  Thomas Lennon (Dangle) and Robert Garant (Junior) are still the funniest attractions of Reno 911, and even when a new recruit (Mary Birdsong) joins the force, the show still keeps rolling along.  There's plenty of other hilarity that ensues throughout the season, including Weigel (Kerry Kinney-Silver) planning to wed her serial killer boyfriend; not letting a little thing like him sitting on death row spoil her plans of matrimony.  All in all, the third season of Reno 911 only improves everything that the surprising Comedy Central hit has laid out, and while these cops are definitely not the best, you can't deny that they're not the funniest.",5,The show that shouldn't work still going strong,1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,1155,"['Comedy', 'Central', 'Reno', '911', 'one', 'rare', 'shows', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'yet', 'surprisingly', 'third', 'season', 'show', 'inept', 'officers', 'Reno', 'Nevada', 'sheriff', 'department', 'are', 'freed', 'prison', 'leading', 'new', 'lives', 'only', 'be', 're-united', 'again', 'eventually', 're-instated', 'cops', 'much', 'dismay', 'improvised', 'jokes', 'gags', 'come', 'fast', 'furious', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'show', 'would', 'come', 'expect', 'yet', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'here', 'still', 'feel', 'fresh', 'Thomas', 'Lennon', 'Dangle', 'Robert', 'Garant', 'Junior', 'are', 'still', 'funniest', 'attractions', 'Reno', '911', 'even', 'when', 'new', 'recruit', 'Mary', 'Birdsong', 'force', 'show', 'still', 'rolling', 'along', 'plenty', 'other', 'hilarity', 'season', 'including', 'Weigel', 'Kerry', 'Kinney-Silver', 'planning', 'wed', 'serial', 'killer', 'boyfriend', 'not', 'letting', 'little', 'thing', 'sitting', 'death', 'row', 'spoil', 'plans', 'matrimony', 'third', 'season', 'Reno', '911', 'only', 'everything', 'surprising', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'hit', 'laid', 'out', 'cops', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'best', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', ""'re"", 'not', 'funniest']",N/A
