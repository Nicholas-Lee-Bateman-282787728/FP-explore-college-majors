577115,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00005AFSL,Anyechka,"[5, 5]","At first, I thought I wouldn't feel really involved with this documentary because it largely consisted of a bunch of talking heads, but before long I found myself really drawn into it.  While there did seem to be more footage of the interviews than the wraparound segments of vintage newsreels and other historical coverage, it struck a pretty good balance between the two.  A lot of times I find documentaries that have so much focus on just interviews to be kind of boring, but the way the interviews were presented, and the subjects covered, made all of the difference in the world.  It also helped that this wasn't just the same story we've heard many times before, a criticism a lot of people like to level at films about the WWII and Nazi era.  And when the film came out in 1969, people hadn't been bombarded with all of the films and documentaries about that era the way they have now, so one shouldn't feel jaded or unimpressed just because some of the documentary does cover what is now familiar territory.Divided into two parts, ""The Collapse"" and ""The Choice,"" the film focuses on the city of Clermont-Ferrand, which was host to quite a variety of people.  Director Marcel Oph&uuml;ls interviews people from numerous walks of life, not just people who were, e.g., in the Resistance, against Marshall P&eacute;tain, or supporters of the Vichy government.  These people, ranging from top-ranking government officials, former collaborators and Nazi soldiers, farmers, Resistance fighters, hairdressers, spies, writers, and ordinary people, all did (or didn't do) different things during the war, held different beliefs, and made different decisions.  Some have changed their opinions since the war, some still are convinced they were right to support the Vichy government or fight alongside Germans to defeat Russia.  It's so wonderful to see such a wealth of experiences represented, since it really paints a fascinating picture of a multi-faceted France under both Vichy and Nazi occupation.  Some of the interviewees also contradict one another (sometimes even historical facts, such as the man who unbelievably claims that only 5% of French Jewry were killed), which is also an asset, since how one person experienced or remembered something isn't going to be exactly the same as another person did so.  Very rarely is history so black and white, simplistic, and clear-cut.  Yet another thing going for the film is that it was made in 1969, when the survivors of the occupation were still relatively young, instead of very elderly as they are today, members of an ever-shrinking generation.  It's good to be able to capture their memories and opinions from a time when WWII was still in rather recent memory instead of regarded as an ever-distant historical event.This is a fascinating and incredible documentary, and one shouldn't be put off by the fact that it's four hours long (it's broken into two convenient sections, and they don't drag in spite of their length) or in black and white.  Initially, even though I normally love black and white films, I was a bit skeptical about watching something from the modern era in black and white, but it soon came to seem very effective, giving it more of a classic, timeless, undated feel, far more so than had it been made with the type of color film that was the norm then.  The only drawback is the pricetag; it seems like a rather inflated price, even for a four-hour documentary, when there aren't even any extras, and with a print that could have used a bit more digital restoration.  Other than that, it's top-notch and should be viewed by anyone with an interest in not only WWII but also in how the lessons and experiences of those years are still chillingly pertinent today.",5,Absolutely essential,1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,3744,"['first', 'thought', 'would', ""n't"", 'feel', 'really', 'involved', 'documentary', 'largely', 'consisted', 'bunch', 'talking', 'heads', 'long', 'found', 'really', 'did', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'footage', 'interviews', 'wraparound', 'segments', 'vintage', 'newsreels', 'other', 'historical', 'coverage', 'struck', 'pretty', 'good', 'balance', 'two', 'lot', 'times', 'find', 'documentaries', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'focus', 'just', 'interviews', 'be', 'kind', 'boring', 'way', 'interviews', 'were', 'presented', 'subjects', 'covered', 'made', 'difference', 'world', 'also', 'helped', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'same', 'story', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'criticism', 'lot', 'people', 'level', 'films', 'WWII', 'Nazi', 'era', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', '1969', 'people', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'bombarded', 'films', 'documentaries', 'way', 'have', 'now', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'feel', 'jaded', 'unimpressed', 'just', 'documentary', 'cover', 'what', 'now', 'familiar', 'territory.Divided', 'two', 'parts', 'Collapse', 'Choice', 'film', 'city', 'Clermont-Ferrand', 'was', 'host', 'quite', 'variety', 'people', 'Director', 'Marcel', 'Oph', 'uuml', 'interviews', 'people', 'numerous', 'walks', 'life', 'not', 'just', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'e.g.', 'Resistance', 'Marshall', 'P', 'eacute', 'tain', 'supporters', 'Vichy', 'government', 'people', 'ranging', 'top-ranking', 'government', 'officials', 'former', 'collaborators', 'Nazi', 'soldiers', 'farmers', 'Resistance', 'fighters', 'hairdressers', 'spies', 'writers', 'ordinary', 'people', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'different', 'things', 'war', 'held', 'different', 'beliefs', 'made', 'different', 'decisions', 'have', 'changed', 'opinions', 'war', 'still', 'are', 'convinced', 'were', 'right', 'support', 'Vichy', 'government', 'fight', 'alongside', 'Germans', 'defeat', 'Russia', 'so', 'wonderful', 'see', 'such', 'wealth', 'experiences', 'represented', 'really', 'fascinating', 'picture', 'multi-faceted', 'France', 'Vichy', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'interviewees', 'also', 'contradict', 'one', 'sometimes', 'even', 'historical', 'facts', 'such', 'man', 'who', 'unbelievably', 'only', '5', '%', 'French', 'Jewry', 'were', 'killed', 'also', 'asset', 'how', 'one', 'person', 'experienced', 'remembered', 'something', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'exactly', 'same', 'person', 'did', 'so', 'Very', 'rarely', 'history', 'so', 'black', 'white', 'simplistic', 'clear-cut', 'thing', 'going', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1969', 'when', 'survivors', 'occupation', 'were', 'still', 'relatively', 'young', 'instead', 'very', 'elderly', 'are', 'today', 'members', 'ever-shrinking', 'generation', 'good', 'be', 'able', 'capture', 'memories', 'opinions', 'time', 'when', 'WWII', 'was', 'still', 'rather', 'recent', 'memory', 'instead', 'regarded', 'ever-distant', 'historical', 'event.This', 'fascinating', 'incredible', 'documentary', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'fact', 'four', 'hours', 'long', 'broken', 'two', 'convenient', 'sections', 'do', ""n't"", 'drag', 'spite', 'length', 'black', 'white', 'Initially', 'even', 'normally', 'love', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'was', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'watching', 'something', 'modern', 'era', 'black', 'white', 'soon', 'came', 'seem', 'very', 'effective', 'giving', 'more', 'classic', 'timeless', 'undated', 'feel', 'far', 'more', 'so', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'type', 'color', 'film', 'was', 'norm', 'then', 'only', 'drawback', 'pricetag', 'rather', 'inflated', 'price', 'even', 'four-hour', 'documentary', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'extras', 'print', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'digital', 'restoration', 'Other', 'top-notch', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'anyone', 'interest', 'not', 'only', 'WWII', 'also', 'how', 'lessons', 'experiences', 'years', 'are', 'still', 'chillingly', 'pertinent', 'today']",N/A

In particular, I was glad that one important incident was mentioned at some length, an incident that is strictly avoided in the English speaking world, and that was the stab in the back of France by Britain when the British navy attacked its ally's navy at Mes el Kebir and which was the precipitating factor for the French to collaborate with the Nazi occupation.The movie also does quite a bit in exploding the Fench created myth that the entire French people were in Le Resistance; the reverse was actually the case: the French eagerly licked their boots.One very important historical fact that the film omits (possibly because of the filmmaker's politics?) is that the Communists were the most pro-Nazi element in French society. Stalin and Hitler had become allies with the non-aggression pact; to this day, mention of this alliance is viewed as being very rude, as well as the cooperation that the Communists everywhere in Europe gave the Nazis. Obviously, this cooperation ended when Hitler decided to backstab his ally, Stalin, and since that point, the propaganda has permeated everywhere that it was the Communists who were the most unrelenting anti-Fascist element in Europe from day one.",4,"Overall, a good documentary",1311292800,"07 22, 2011",2011,1320,"['good', 'view', 'life', 'France', 'WW', 'II', 'nice', 'bits', 'pieces', 'fact', 'one', 'can', 'add', 'one', 'knowledge', 'war', 'particular', 'was', 'glad', 'one', 'important', 'incident', 'was', 'mentioned', 'length', 'incident', 'strictly', 'avoided', 'English', 'speaking', 'world', 'was', 'stab', 'back', 'France', 'Britain', 'when', 'British', 'navy', 'attacked', 'ally', 'navy', 'Mes', 'el', 'Kebir', 'was', 'precipitating', 'factor', 'French', 'collaborate', 'Nazi', 'occupation.The', 'movie', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'exploding', 'Fench', 'created', 'myth', 'entire', 'French', 'people', 'were', 'Le', 'Resistance', 'reverse', 'was', 'actually', 'case', 'French', 'eagerly', 'licked', 'boots.One', 'very', 'important', 'historical', 'fact', 'film', 'omits', 'possibly', 'filmmaker', 'politics', 'Communists', 'were', 'most', 'pro-Nazi', 'element', 'French', 'society', 'Stalin', 'Hitler', 'had', 'become', 'allies', 'non-aggression', 'pact', 'day', 'mention', 'alliance', 'viewed', 'being', 'very', 'rude', 'as', 'well', 'cooperation', 'Communists', 'everywhere', 'Europe', 'gave', 'Nazis', 'Obviously', 'cooperation', 'ended', 'when', 'Hitler', 'decided', 'backstab', 'ally', 'Stalin', 'point', 'propaganda', 'permeated', 'everywhere', 'was', 'Communists', 'who', 'were', 'most', 'unrelenting', 'anti-Fascist', 'element', 'Europe', 'day', 'one']",N/A

I had long read about it but knew very little about the official pronouncements of the collaborationist government. I assumed that The Sorrow and the Pity was strictly a documentary about the French resistance, but was pleasantly surprised by its depth. It describes the Vichy of Petain and Laval quite thoroughly. You may recognize some of Ophuls' interviewees from The World at War (such as Edward Spears), but the stand out individual here was the fellow who volunteered for the SS. I assume he served in the Charlemagne outfit. Frankly, I was surprised he was alive and actually showing his face. His point that the slaughter of 1,600 French sailors by the English was a motivating force for him to join the Germans was something I would have never considered. It seems inconceivable back then for the French to have even hesitated siding with anybody other than England--given the competition--but it is clear that Anglophobia was rampant after ""the rout"" of May 1940. The most sensational thing about this film is the footage of the collaborationists. It seems as if modern history has made great attempts to cover up just how much the citizenry backed Petain (at first) and looked sympathetically to the Nazis. The speeches, the newsreels, and the photos are incredibly valuable and terribly interesting- especially if you're a history buff.

577123,A1GX4R797QZZP8,B00005AFSL,ixta_coyotl,"[20, 26]","While I had dreaded watching because of the 4+ hour sitting time, actually I found The Sorrow and the Pity to go by quite quickly. The Image Entertainment DVD, like the film, is divided into two parts each just over two hours long.  You can easily watch one part in the morning and a second in the afternoon.  The film shows WWII in France thru the lives of the regular people it affected, a style which probably influenced the makers of the Vietnam documentary Hearts and Minds a few years later.  Like most documentaries, the director certainly seems to take sides in this story: he appears to be exposing the ""collaborators"".  But given that, I still feel he gave a balanced presentation of events.A few provocative thoughts came to mind whilst watching this film. Ophuls paints an air of shame over the collaborators, but he provides no insight into why they chose not to fight.  I would suggest two factors that caused such widespread support amongst the French for Petain and non-violence. The first was the utter moral depravity of the Great War, fought just over 25 years prior.  In that war, from a population of 40 million, the French suffered over 1 million dead, 4 million wounded (1.5 million of those permanently maimed); about a 75% casualty rate, all in a war which their leaders promised would ""be over before Christmas"" (it lasted over four full years and destroyed much of the nation's infrastructure as well).  If you need some background on this, I strongly suggest you watch Stanley Kubrick's great film ""Paths of Glory"" (1957).  Petain was a hero of the Great War and knew firsthand the costs associated with fighting Germany again.  Secondly, there was a great malaise amongst the people in 1930s France related to the depression and corruption.  A quick survey of l'Age d'Or 1930s French cinema taps into this right away.  Check out Marcel Carne's ""Port of Shadows"" (1938) or Jean Renoir's ""Rules of the Game"" (actually banned by the 3rd Republic in 1939). Given this background, why would the French want to go to war again to defend a corrupt government which had them mired in poverty?  Petain offered Frenchmen an option that did not lead to the immediate destruction of their nation, even if it meant some indignities in the short term.  After all, wasn't their entrance into the EU a very similar venture?  Does the Euro (run from the German Bundesbank) make them less French?  Less patriotic?In Ophuls defense, he does a fair job of showing the roots of the ""resistance"": many of them were vandals and brutes, and almost all of them were communists.  French resistance fighters dropped bombs on their own country to aid the English.  During the early years of the occupation, German soldiers were shown to be orderly and respectful to the local population.

I mean, the prevailing wisdom is that they fought (badly) a short time, surrendered ignominiously, and then wanted a huge chunk of the glory and German territory to occupy after the English and the Americans saved them from the Nazis. But after watching The Sorrow and The Pity, I came away with a different view.On the eve of WWII, France was a country beset by weak political leadership and growing tensions between left and right. The Socialist government of Leon Blum was widely reviled and after its collapse the country drifted from one domestic crisis to another as war clouds gathered ominously to the east. On paper, France was well-prepared for war with the numerically fewer and militarily less advanced German army. The German high command did not think the war would be easy and many doubted that France could be beaten. But it was. As it turned out, German ideology, discipline, and training trumped French overconfidence and disunity.The Sorrow and the Pity shows the tragedy of defeat and the disarray into which France fell in its aftermath. WWI hero Petain took command in the part of France the Germans did not occupy and made Vichy its capital. He made many errors, but in retrospect you have to say he tried to keep the Germans at bay as much as possible. Think how the war may have turned out had the Germans occupied the country entirely!In a series of interviews interspersed with period film footage we see the occupation through the eyes of both the occupier and the occupied. We hear stories of bravery and cowardice, tragedy and triumph, loyalty and treachery. Deep thinkers might be left musing about what might have happened in their own countries under similar circumstances. Importantly, we get two views of Laval and Petain instead of just the usual dismissal of them both as traitors.The Sorrow and the Pity should give all of us pause. Watch, listen, learn and think about what your own reactions might be if your country were occupied. Would you use occupation as a cover to settle personal vendettas? Would you keep your head down and try to go about your business unobtrusively? Would you passively resist? Or would you actively work for liberation? We all might imagine ourselves as doing the most heroic thing, but what would we really do? And would you rationalize whatever it was you ended up doing after it was all over? Millions of Germans and Frenchmen did!I really recommend that anyone interested in obtaining a well-rounded view of WWII and the French role in it take the 4 hours+ and see The Sorrow and the Pity. Not only does the viewer learn a lot about that aspect of the war, but also about human nature.

It is, for the most part, a dry, far-too-long documentary with a decidedly political slant.  The editng is conspicuous.  A self-satisfied ex-German officer occupies, in my opinion, an overly large part of the film.  I think the producers of this film had to look some time to find such a stereotypical German.Still, the film is of value.  It depicts, through the mouths of participants, the terrible schisms that existed and still exist in France.  Some Frenchmen clearly tried to live more-or-less normal lives during the occupation; others joined the Resistance; and still others collaborated or even joined the SS.The Resistance fighters are primarily leftists and Communists, people the producers seem to be sympathetic with.  The producers do not seriously question their motives i.e. were they fighting for Stalin or France?  Through pointed questioning, it is possible to tell that they are less than sympathetic to people who tried to live through the occupation with as little trouble as possible.To me, the most interesting character is a Frenchman who joined the SS.  He appears to be a little less self-protective than most of the other people interviewed.  He describes the French political turmoil of the early 1930's with the French Press stirring up trouble and high school battles between right and left wing students.  He tells of the writhing French anti-semitism between the wars.  He says that his parental roots were right wing and that he was especially impacted by films showing nuns and priests murdered by the Communists during the Spanish Civil War.  He also tells of his admiration for the young German troops with their good behavior, moral and discipline.  He joined up to become disillusioned as the Germans threw his French Charlemagne Divisions--with 7,000 SS Frenchmen--into rearguard battles fighting the Russians at the end of the war.  Only 300 survived.Other than these, we see many shots of Petain and Laval with discussions about their complicity and motives.  We hear of Laval's, in particular, cooperation with the Nazis in their antisemitic endeavors.Overall I think 'The Sorrow and the Pity' is worth watching as a historical document.  I wish it had been more evenhanded but, unfortunately, such a documentary is impossible now.

Rasband,"[27, 30]","I was a little daunted at watching ""The Sorrow and the Pity"" because it is four hours long, and inAnnie HallWoody Allen presents this movie as a sort of dour duty that you have to sit through to prove your own ethical hardiness.  It turns out that this landmark documentary is as gripping and riveting as any fine fictional film, because it handles its thorny issues with great skill and is as carefully crafted and filmed as a Hollywood thriller.  I wonder how much Ken Burns was influenced by it, because it seems to be a sort of forerunner of his work; that is, documentaries that are planned and executed as art, not just as regurgitation of stale facts.Ophuls talks to many French and Germans who lived during the time, and who either resisted the Nazis or gave into them.  (It's a little aggravating that on the DVD there are no titles to identify who is speaking; you have to piece together who said what from a close reading of the closing credits.)  People were more innocent 30 years ago about appearing before a camera and they maybe weren't as aware of just how revealing about themselves it could be.  Thus you get interview subjects like Laval's nephew, and the former German officer at his child's wedding, and the aristocrat who joined the Waffen SS, who inadvertently disclose their opportunism or self-deception or venality or cowardice.  The clips from now rarely seen propaganda films that Ophuls uses are mesmerizing.  During the scenes from the anti-Semitic ""Jud Suss"" you get a feeling of palpable evil as you view just how the Nazis prepared their subjects for the coming holocaust.Ophuls presents Vichy as a colossal moral failure by the French people, a collapse of character that haunts them to this very day.  (Ophuls couldn't get French financing for the film, and then state-run French television refused to show it.)  He shatters forever the myth that all the French were in the Resistance.  ""Sorrow"" and ""pity"" are the very words one uses to define ""tragedy"";  ""tragedy"" is the word you must use to describe the French experience of World War II.

It transports the viewer back to World War II France and conveys the courage, cowardice and hatred arrising from events most of us will thankfully never have to live through.  This film helps the viewer understand (or gain an insight)into life in occupied France.I was born in 1968 - well after the end of WWII.  Like most English people I hold the view that we either kicked French ass, or saved their skin depending on the particular conflict (we'll forget about the Norman invasion and Joan of Arc).  However, given total collapse, would the UK or US be any different?  Some people would collaborate (for ideological or financial reasons, perhaps for survival or out of ignorance), the majority would do nothing and the minority would resist. Would it be so different for any other country?  One area the film touches on is the French treatment of Jews - it would appear the French were just as inhernly anti-semitic as the Germans.  Anti semitism in france appears to be systemic (e.g. WWI ?Dreyfus affair).One disturbing aspect of the film was the punishment of young women who slept with the Germans.  The most minor acts of collaboration were treated the most harshly.  The war in france during the occupation bordered on cival war between factions of the resistance (FFI, Gaulist) and Nazi groups (Millice).  A situation amounting to anarchy existed for a short period after the liberation.Sorrow and pity sum up what I felt for many of the individuals concerned.  It presents a dilema I hope I am never faced with - we don't know how we would react both as nations or individuals unless placed in those circumstances.  Probaly the closest the UK came was the Channel Islands, occupied from 40-45.  The only part of the US that has lived under military occupation, since the revolution, is the South after the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865 - neither example is comprable to the total defeat of France in WWII.  The doucmentary brings home the shades of grey in war.  No conflict is balck or white, however much we wish it were.  Otherwise 'normal' people do bad things - this film illustrates the moral ambiguity war imposes.Easy to understand why France wants to forget this period.",5,Very moving documenary,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,2245,"['most', 'moving', 'documentary', 'have', 'seen', 'viewer', 'back', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'France', 'conveys', 'courage', 'cowardice', 'hatred', 'arrising', 'events', 'most', 'will', 'thankfully', 'never', 'have', 'live', 'film', 'viewer', 'understand', 'gain', 'insight', 'life', 'occupied', 'France.I', 'was', 'born', '1968', 'well', 'end', 'WWII', 'most', 'English', 'people', 'hold', 'view', 'kicked', 'French', 'ass', 'saved', 'skin', 'depending', 'particular', 'conflict', ""'ll"", 'forget', 'Norman', 'invasion', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'However', 'given', 'total', 'collapse', 'would', 'UK', 'US', 'be', 'different', 'people', 'would', 'collaborate', 'ideological', 'financial', 'reasons', 'perhaps', 'survival', 'ignorance', 'majority', 'would', 'do', 'nothing', 'minority', 'would', 'resist', 'Would', 'be', 'so', 'different', 'other', 'country', 'One', 'area', 'film', 'touches', 'French', 'treatment', 'Jews', 'would', 'appear', 'French', 'were', 'just', 'inhernly', 'anti-semitic', 'Germans', 'Anti', 'semitism', 'france', 'be', 'systemic', 'e.g', 'WWI', 'Dreyfus', 'affair', '.One', 'disturbing', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'punishment', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'slept', 'Germans', 'most', 'minor', 'acts', 'collaboration', 'were', 'treated', 'most', 'harshly', 'war', 'france', 'occupation', 'bordered', 'cival', 'war', 'factions', 'resistance', 'FFI', 'Gaulist', 'Nazi', 'groups', 'Millice', 'situation', 'amounting', 'anarchy', 'existed', 'short', 'period', 'liberation.Sorrow', 'pity', 'sum', 'up', 'what', 'felt', 'many', 'individuals', 'concerned', 'dilema', 'hope', 'am', 'never', 'faced', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'would', 'react', 'nations', 'individuals', 'placed', 'circumstances', 'Probaly', 'closest', 'UK', 'came', 'was', 'Channel', 'Islands', 'occupied', '40-45', 'only', 'part', 'US', 'lived', 'military', 'occupation', 'revolution', 'South', 'defeat', 'Confederacy', '1865', 'example', 'comprable', 'total', 'defeat', 'France', 'WWII', 'doucmentary', 'brings', 'home', 'shades', 'grey', 'war', 'conflict', 'balck', 'white', 'however', 'much', 'wish', 'were', 'Otherwise', ""'normal"", 'people', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'film', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'war', 'imposes.Easy', 'understand', 'why', 'France', 'forget', 'period']",N/A

I'm sure that seeing it on a &quot;big screen&quot; was more gripping than on a normal TV. Any study of French history, beginning with and before the Dryfus(?) Affair knows how deeply ingrained the anti-semitism was in France. Even the United States, when FDR turned away a boatload of Jews from our shores to return to Germany, where they were all murdered, did so partly to satisfy American anti-semites (and himself). Many of the people's mixed feelings show the Germans were doing the thing they didn't have the guts to do themselves. This is a great film for the depth it probes into the French people. At the same time, brave Frenchmen put themselves in great danger to help the Jews, so this is an indicment of a national attitude, not its entire population. The fortune that the French gov't has made in recent years selling weapons to Arab nations while voting against anything for Isreal show that things haven't changed much in 60 yrs.

Yes, it is the long documentary film about the holocaust that they talk about.Marcel Ophuls, son of Max Ophuls has created a poignant potrait of french society under the Nazis occupation, and their relation to the most horible crime in human history -- he indeed is not afraid to tell the truth; that holocaust took place in France because the French citizen allowed it to happen to the least to say, and even have colaborated to it. However, this film is not a simple minded accusation, but a thoughtful study about a society under pressure, and its strugle for survival.It certainly is a deppressing film; the viewers are constantl reminded to what they would have done if they were --we were-- living under such sircumstances. It is truthful to that extreme extent. It's an amazing film; thoughtful, inteligent, emotional.The opening of this film steered quite a controversy in Frannce, but neverthless had led the way to fictional films about the Holocaust and the ocupation that are more mature and adult, not afraid to portray the truth; Jean-Pierre Melville's THE ARMY OF SHADOW, Francois Truffaut's THE LAST METRO, among others.",5,"Courageous, controversial and truthful",987897600,"04 22, 2001",2001,1292,"['most', 'film', 'viewers', 'masterpiece', 'Marcel', 'Ophuls', 'known', 'being', 'continuously', 'mentioned', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'Yes', 'long', 'documentary', 'film', 'holocaust', 'talk', 'about.Marcel', 'Ophuls', 'son', 'Max', 'Ophuls', 'created', 'poignant', 'potrait', 'french', 'society', 'Nazis', 'occupation', 'relation', 'most', 'horible', 'crime', 'human', 'history', 'indeed', 'not', 'afraid', 'tell', 'truth', 'holocaust', 'took', 'place', 'France', 'French', 'citizen', 'allowed', 'happen', 'least', 'say', 'even', 'have', 'colaborated', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'simple', 'minded', 'accusation', 'thoughtful', 'study', 'society', 'pressure', 'strugle', 'survival.It', 'certainly', 'deppressing', 'film', 'viewers', 'are', 'constantl', 'reminded', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'were', 'were', 'living', 'such', 'sircumstances', 'truthful', 'extreme', 'extent', 'amazing', 'film', 'thoughtful', 'inteligent', 'emotional.The', 'opening', 'film', 'steered', 'quite', 'controversy', 'Frannce', 'neverthless', 'had', 'led', 'way', 'fictional', 'films', 'Holocaust', 'ocupation', 'are', 'more', 'mature', 'adult', 'not', 'afraid', 'portray', 'truth', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Melville', 'THE', 'ARMY', 'OF', 'SHADOW', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'THE', 'LAST', 'METRO', 'others']",N/A
