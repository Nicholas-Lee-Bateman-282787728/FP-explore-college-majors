Many story telling methods put together, Black and white, interrupted time line, dream sequences, fantasy scenes, and narration just to name a few. This should be too much but just works so well.Soundtrack is different and good. Zooey Deschanel does some vocals she & him as artist track I think. J G Levitt can sing too.This is a Fox Searchlight film. A corporate backed independent film company that puts out good movies. Go figure. Wrestler Juno Garden State to name a few they put out.Zooey is as cute and interesting as ever. Levitt is becoming one of the best working younger actors out there. His script choices are varied and good. This from a guy that started on an inane TV comedy and through his choices made a place for himself. As in the movie chance played it's part I bet, but he can act. Well. He was great inThe LookoutAs it was happening I still couldn't dislike Zooey's character. The story was deeper than I expected.

But as a huge Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan, I don't think this role is good for him because I hate the way he ran away after he saw Summer's ring. But as a heartbroken female, it made me happy to see him sad (I am sorry about the loss of his amazing brother). It's just acting anyway. I love this movie so much! When it was released on cable TV, I never missed it. As an ex-Smiths fan, their songs made me unhappy, but they didn't last that long in the scenes, which was great. Summer and Tom have great chemistry, and the landscapes are beautiful. I also love that the African-Americans/'black' Americans are portrayed positively, and the ratio of 'blacks' to 'whites' is part of American culture. All in all a great romantic comedy.

They just don't make romantic comedies like this anymore but in some ways - this film is a drama set to a story of two people who just can't seem to make it work. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is absolutely brilliant and even Zooey Deschanel surpised me even though I am not a fan of her deadpan acting. This film is funny, charming, and completely realistic when it comes to the beginning, middle, and end of a doomed relationship - and I like how the film travels back between the past and present.

We were disappointed. Perhaps this was due to high expectations, or maybe this is partly because, as we are immediately informed, ""this is not a love story"". But mostly because, despite overall good acting and good direction and an uncommon (although not that original) structure, we didn't care too much about either characters or about their not-love-story. Both of them look like good-looking 30-year olds, but both behave like 16-year old people, although in different ways.The script is not particularly funny or particularly witty or particularly moving. In all fairness, this not-love-story has the redeeming quality of feeling significantly more real than the stereotyped love stories you can find in 99% or romantic comedies. However, the script does not go into any uncharted territory. Countless movies have told stories of fate vs will, commitment vs casual relationship, love-at-first-sight, young-people-who-finally-find-their-way-into-life etc etc. The structure of the movie, with voice-overs, continuous back-and-forth in time and sometimes cartoons and graphic art popping into the picture, are also surely uncommon but all seen before.I guess what bothered me was that this movie was clearly an attempt to tell a different story in a different way but it ended up being a not very compelling story about two not very interesting characters.I am not sure I am sorry I spent a couple of hours watching this movie but I am fairly certain I will not watch it again.",2,Underwhelming,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,1631,"['girlfriend', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'reading', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'here', 'there', 'seeing', '87', '%', 'tomatometer', 'were', 'disappointed', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'due', 'high', 'expectations', 'maybe', 'partly', 'because', 'are', 'immediately', 'informed', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'mostly', 'overall', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'direction', 'uncommon', 'not', 'original', 'structure', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'characters', 'not-love-story', 'look', 'good-looking', '30-year', 'olds', 'behave', '16-year', 'old', 'people', 'different', 'ways.The', 'script', 'not', 'particularly', 'funny', 'particularly', 'witty', 'particularly', 'moving', 'fairness', 'not-love-story', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'feeling', 'significantly', 'more', 'real', 'stereotyped', 'love', 'stories', 'can', 'find', '99', '%', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'However', 'script', 'not', 'go', 'uncharted', 'territory', 'Countless', 'movies', 'have', 'told', 'stories', 'fate', 'vs', 'will', 'commitment', 'vs', 'casual', 'relationship', 'love-at-first-sight', 'young-people-who-finally-find-their-way-into-life', 'etc', 'etc', 'structure', 'movie', 'voice-overs', 'continuous', 'back-and-forth', 'time', 'sometimes', 'cartoons', 'graphic', 'art', 'popping', 'picture', 'are', 'also', 'surely', 'uncommon', 'seen', 'before.I', 'guess', 'what', 'bothered', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'clearly', 'attempt', 'tell', 'different', 'story', 'different', 'way', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'not', 'very', 'compelling', 'story', 'two', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'characters.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'am', 'sorry', 'spent', 'couple', 'hours', 'watching', 'movie', 'am', 'fairly', 'certain', 'will', 'not', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

1241895,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B001UV4XUG,amerdale876,"[4, 5]","Next toAway We Go [Blu-ray] andUp (4 Disc Combo Pack with Digital Copy and DVD) [Blu-ray], one of my favorite movies of the summer and probably the year! Of course, I am a bit biased since I love Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. In the time of cliched romantic comedies that do little to entertain and simply churn out the same old rom-com formula to perpetuate the two romantic ideals of unrealistic plots: (1) the knight in shining armor comes in to save the girl; or (2) the jerk/rebel who's just misunderstood and can change his ways if only he met the right girl -- there is a great newcomer to romantic comedies that I can only hope Hollywood embraces as a model. And ""(500) Days of Summer"" is the template.Gordon-Levitt, one of my favorite actors, plays Tom (with whom I can definitely relate), a diehard romantic. He meets Summer (Deschanel) who doesn't believe in love and being ""tied down."" However, that doesn't stop their relationship from blooming into romance. Right up front, the narrator informs us that ""this is a story of boy meets girl, however, this is not a love story."" Told in fragmented segments (hence, the 500 days), the story brings out the realistic feelings and moments in a relationship, yet displays them with the techniques of an indie film, referencing musicals, avant-garde/New Wave French cinema, documentary and Hollywood-glossy romantic movie as we see the lovable highs and pathetic lows of Tom and Summer's love life.It's pretty safe to say that nearly everyone in their 20s and older probably has been in a relationship like this one, whether they've been Tom or Summer. And, hopefully, anyone who has experienced such a relationship makes it to that 500th day that is so perfectly and realistically captured in the film. Director Marc Webb, who is only known for directing music videos, successfully debuts as a feature film director, although one can tell through his techniques that he made his mark directing in the video format. Of course, I would also be remiss if I forgot to mention the superb use of excellent music in this film. The soundtrack ((500) Days Of Summer-Music From The Motion Picture) is a must-have!The supporting cast is great (especially Chloe Moretz - who I can't wait to see in the film adaptation ofKick-Ass, Geoffrey Arend and Matthew Gray Gubler, who has one of the sweetest, romantic lines in the film), but Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt and their chemistry are the genius, charming center of this film. And although marketed as ""not a love story,"" ""(500) Days of Summer"" is just that. It's just not the kind of love story that sugar-coats and idealizes every thing that is love; it's not the usual Hollywood love story. This film also showcases the heartbreak and letdown that can come with love. And not in that formulaic ""someone-screws-up-or-comes-between-the-two-lovers-and-they-have-to-overcome-it-or-confront-their-feelings-in-front-of-the-other-to-move-on-and-live-happily-ever-after"" kind of way. Whew. That's a lot of dashes.No. The obstacles in this film are presented with a realistic intensity that Gordon-Levitt pulls off effortlessly. And no, Summer is not a bitch who leads Tom on. It's not that simple to label her as that. In fact, she says right up front that she's not looking for anything serious. However, as with any relationship, emotions can take over and take us to unexpected places. And Deschanel's Summer finds herself honestly opening up in no way that had with other past suitors. Deschanel portrays the object of Tom's affection with a charm and slight tragedy -- seen brilliantly when she and Tom are watching the awesome ending toThe Graduate (40th Anniversary Collector's Edition)-- that I only hope helps her to broaden her resume since Hollywood could use more of her. By the end of the film, you care for both characters and wish the best for both of them. You see Tom's necessary awakening that helps him to grow from this unrealistic, naive romantic to someone who can still dream of true love but also see true relationships for what they are. This comes to fruition in the film's climax when Tom and Summer reconcile and there's a silent moment between the two where the viewer recognizes that these two characters have come full circle and it was through their experiences and relationship with one another that helped them each to grow in great ways. Now, if only every other rom-com movie nowadays made me feel that way! Unfortunately, like another great little movie calledOnce, ""(500) Days of Summer"" was in limited release, but that only makes it a rare little gem that only the most diehard of moviegoers will treasure when they find it.

And this isn't your typical boy-meets-girl romance comedy (if it can even be described as a romance film to begin with), nor is it really a comedy at all. It's more of a drama about love and loss, and being able to pick up the pieces of your life when things don't go quite as planned. What made this movie stand out, though, was the way certain scenes were filmed, which did well to convey the emotions of Tom Hansen's expectations and the reality of the world around him.

1241897,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001UV4XUG,Andrew Ellington,"[8, 9]","One of those rare films where style and originality don't take away from heartfelt poignancy; `(500) Days of Summer' is a beautifully composed and constructed love story.  Yes, I know that it makes you painfully away in the first few seconds that it is NOT a love story, but if you believe that then you're a sucker for a tall tale.  This is not a conventional love story, sure, but when all is said and done, `(500) Days of Summer' is one of the most splendidly accurate depictions of love put to film.The film jumps sporadically through the 500 day whirlwind romance between Tom and Summer.  The film actually begins in the middle, after a nasty breakup, and then jumps back to when they met and so on and so forth.  This filming style has been used by quite a few filmmakers and it's a style that either works extremely well or completely butchers a movie.  This is one instance where the style is almost necessary.  Sure, this tale could have been told in a straight forward canonical fashion, but the film really drags us in by teasing us with future events, keeping us completely engaged as we contemplate what led up to what we are witnessing.It was a smart move that I applaud.One thing that I really admired about the film is that fact that Summer Finn is basically presented as a blank canvas.  One of my friends noted that the film fails to really give us any reason for Tom to become so obsessed with her.  In the film his sister Rachel even comments that Tom only loves her because they like the same band.  The thing to remember is that the story is being told from Tom's perspective.  We are not getting two sides of the story here, and so what we see is what Tom sees, and not all of it is accurate.  Even the film acknowledges that, as can be seen from what Rachel says to Tom.  This is a story about how we can blind ourselves to the faults and missteps of the ones we love.  Tom thinks everything is perfect, everything is wonderful and so we, the audience, see everything as wonderful.  Summer's outbursts and significant `pulling away' seems almost out of place and unwarranted because all we can see are the blinders that Tom has put up.  It's a very bold and brutally honest move, and I really admire the film for not taking the generic route of creating a faux love hate relationship.Nothing about this film feels `done before'.One aspect of the film that really embraced me was the beautiful way in which it was shot.  The film feels so crisp, with beautiful lighting that gives the film an almost sun drenched appearance.  It's a nice compliment to the fanciful idea of everlasting love, which Tom entertains throughout.  In particular is the scene towards the end, where high expectations and bitter realities are delivered side by side on split screen.  The sequence is probably my favorite in the film.The performances are all very good, Joseph Gordon-Levitt once again delivering a stunning performance, one that is much different than anything he's ever done before.  He proves that he can fuse the funny aspects of his acting style with the dramatic and make it believable.  He is the perfect love-sick puppy here.  Zooey Deschanel (who has always been one of my favorite actresses) is the perfect doll to dote over.

1241901,A2RPZ4DT6O7TBG,B001UV4XUG,A.R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","""(500) Days of Summer"" struck me, and not in a good way.  I enjoyed it upon reflection, but not at first.  I felt sad, depressed, and filled with angst immediately following my Valentine's viewing of ""(500) Days of Summer.""  However, like aforementioned, my initial reaction was more based in the circumstance, rather than the actual quality of the film.""(500) Days of Summer"" falls into a sub-genre of the standard romantic comedy-one that I can't really put my finger on.  I am almost positive that there is a name for it, yet my knowledge of film classifications is most impressive once I strike moot.  At parts ""(500) Days of Summer"" fit the rom-com bill perfectly; however, on the whole it's an entirely different beast.  It exists in a subset.  It tries to more deeply explore the idea of love, rather than giving audiences another difficult kindling of a couple not meant to-be/meant to-be.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays, Tom.  I wouldn't call Tom `helplessly romantic,' but he is definitely more-inclined to romanticism.  He believes in true love and the concept of a soulmate.  His counterpart, Summer played by Zooey Deschanel, feels oppositely.  She possesses that certain kind of `x-factor' and subsequently has been hit on her whole life.So what would happen if these two met and fell in love?That is precisely the intent behind screenwriters, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber's ""(500) Days of Summer.""  The plot is uniquely structured in that it skips around a 500 day period of Tom's life during which Summer played an influential role.  The two obviously fall in love (after meeting as coworkers), but the real heart of the movie begs the question: Is this the one?As an audience member we get to see the goofy moments, the fights, the make-ups, and all-of-the other little joys and horrors of life's relationships.  The story skips around never linearly progressing through the `500 days,' yet the conversations amongst Tom and the rest of the cast compound to create a cohesive and synergetic film.Funnily enough, the end of the film is quite surprising and poignant in the fact that it doesn't end in the manner that you would hope or expect it to.  Not only does ""(500) Days of Summer"" focus on the trials-and-tribulations of relationships, but the gray.  That area between Venn Diagram circles that causes most so much anguish and joy.I found the acting to superb.  Joseph-Gordon Levitt nails his performance and Zooey Deschanel is excellent company.  They have wonderful onscreen chemistry.  It seems a bit of a different role for her (not the typical Manic Pixie Dream Girl role), but it works.  The supporting cast is small, but their scenes are wonderful.  Tom's friends and sister, played by Geoffrey Arend, Matthew Gray Gubler, and Chlo Grace Moretz, add to Tom's personality by creating a funny trio (sometimes quatro) of banter-a type of banter that we have all had with our friends and can easily relate to.  Clark Gregg's portrayal of Tom's boss is perfect.  At times, I wish I had such a pragmatic boss!  Talk about rolling with punches and playing to people's strengths during a time of emotional turmoil.The nonlinear structure definitely plays to the quality of the cinematography in a very positive manner.  Life is chaotic and doesn't make sense, until you start to piece it together after the fact.  The cut of the movie accentuates this, which (again) furthers the relatability of the film.Directing-wise, Marc Webb keeps things in focus when they could easily have gotten off track and into confusing tangents that would have been detrimental to the film.  His skill is definitely praiseworthy and on that note I will leave you with this:Check out ""(500) Days of Summer.""  It's not your typical romantic comedy.  It's something more.  Something to be covenanted and something to entertain ideals with in spare moments.  It's a great film.  Even with my initial reaction I can say this comfortably.",4,"""(500) Days of Summer""",1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,3938,"['500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'struck', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'enjoyed', 'reflection', 'not', 'first', 'felt', 'sad', 'depressed', 'filled', 'angst', 'immediately', 'following', 'Valentine', 'viewing', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'However', 'aforementioned', 'initial', 'reaction', 'was', 'more', 'based', 'circumstance', 'rather', 'actual', 'quality', 'film', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'sub-genre', 'standard', 'romantic', 'comedy-one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'put', 'finger', 'am', 'almost', 'positive', 'name', 'yet', 'knowledge', 'film', 'classifications', 'most', 'impressive', 'once', 'strike', 'moot', 'parts', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'fit', 'rom-com', 'bill', 'perfectly', 'however', 'whole', 'entirely', 'different', 'beast', 'subset', 'more', 'deeply', 'explore', 'idea', 'love', 'rather', 'giving', 'audiences', 'difficult', 'kindling', 'couple', 'not', 'meant', 'to-be/meant', 'to-be.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'plays', 'Tom', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'Tom', 'helplessly', 'romantic', 'definitely', 'more-inclined', 'romanticism', 'true', 'love', 'concept', 'soulmate', 'counterpart', 'Summer', 'played', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'oppositely', 'certain', 'kind', 'x-factor', 'subsequently', 'been', 'hit', 'whole', 'life.So', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'two', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'precisely', 'intent', 'screenwriters', 'Scott', 'Neustadter', 'Michael', 'H.', 'Weber', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'plot', 'uniquely', 'structured', '500', 'day', 'period', 'Tom', 'life', 'Summer', 'played', 'influential', 'role', 'two', 'obviously', 'fall', 'love', 'meeting', 'coworkers', 'real', 'heart', 'movie', 'question', 'one', 'audience', 'member', 'get', 'see', 'goofy', 'moments', 'fights', 'make-ups', 'all-of-the', 'other', 'little', 'joys', 'horrors', 'life', 'relationships', 'story', 'never', 'linearly', 'progressing', '500', 'days', 'yet', 'conversations', 'amongst', 'Tom', 'rest', 'cast', 'compound', 'create', 'cohesive', 'synergetic', 'film.Funnily', 'enough', 'end', 'film', 'quite', 'surprising', 'poignant', 'fact', ""n't"", 'end', 'manner', 'would', 'hope', 'expect', 'Not', 'only', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'focus', 'trials-and-tribulations', 'relationships', 'gray', 'area', 'Venn', 'Diagram', 'most', 'so', 'much', 'anguish', 'joy.I', 'found', 'acting', 'superb', 'Joseph-Gordon', 'Levitt', 'performance', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'excellent', 'company', 'have', 'wonderful', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'bit', 'different', 'role', 'not', 'typical', 'Manic', 'Pixie', 'Dream', 'Girl', 'role', 'supporting', 'cast', 'small', 'scenes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Tom', 'friends', 'sister', 'played', 'Geoffrey', 'Arend', 'Matthew', 'Gray', 'Gubler', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'add', 'Tom', 'personality', 'creating', 'funny', 'trio', 'sometimes', 'quatro', 'banter-a', 'type', 'banter', 'have', 'had', 'friends', 'can', 'easily', 'relate', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'portrayal', 'Tom', 'boss', 'perfect', 'times', 'wish', 'had', 'pragmatic', 'boss', 'Talk', 'rolling', 'punches', 'playing', 'people', 'strengths', 'time', 'emotional', 'turmoil.The', 'nonlinear', 'structure', 'definitely', 'quality', 'cinematography', 'very', 'positive', 'manner', 'Life', 'chaotic', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'start', 'piece', 'together', 'fact', 'cut', 'movie', 'again', 'relatability', 'film.Directing-wise', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'things', 'focus', 'when', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'gotten', 'off', 'track', 'confusing', 'tangents', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'detrimental', 'film', 'skill', 'definitely', 'praiseworthy', 'note', 'will', 'leave', 'Check', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'not', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'something', 'more', 'Something', 'be', 'covenanted', 'something', 'entertain', 'ideals', 'spare', 'moments', 'great', 'film', 'Even', 'initial', 'reaction', 'can', 'say', 'comfortably']",N/A

An interesting twist on the boy-meets girl tale. The movie tries (an often succeeds) to break the facade of lovey-dovey stories which is piled on us by Hollywood in the name of romantic comedies.I would have given it four stars but there were instants where the movie seemed to be trying too hard. With any good art, the key is restraint. Even in a Jackson Pollack painting of splattered colors, you see the control.I wish the director had taken a sharper scalpel to the editing process. The song sequence just distracted from the feel of the movie and seemed forced. Also the out of sequence narration has become an over used tool in the indie genre. That is why I have deducted half a star.One thing to note is the camerawork. I can't recall a movie in which LA landscapes have been shot with such love and attention.

1241905,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B001UV4XUG,barry,"[1, 1]","I adore this film.  Independent films take chances that mainstream films aren't as willing to do.  Some people are disappointed in this film and find it dull or boring.  That is because it is being promoted as a romatnic comedy and that makes people think it falls in that specific genre and it does not.  Sadly, even on the blu ray case it describes the film as a romantic comedy.  Then one expects the typical boy meets girl, boy looses girl with a very happy ending.The film is actually a deep character study of a man and a woman who meet, form a relationship and the emotional ride they both go on.  It studies very honestly how people have expectations in relationships and that two people can be having very different experiences.  SUMMER named in the title is actually the female role played by Zooey Deschanel and the film very creatively flips from various days in the 500 the couple spend together one to another.  It sounds hokey but it magically works and you will find yourself emotionally invested in these two characters and will relate more to one than the other depending on how you look at love yourself.For me the truly shining piece of this film was Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  He has proven himself a gifted actor with a long list of independent films as well as many mainstream.  He creates a very strong character here, a man who is desperately seeking his soul mate and believes he finds it in Summer.  Following his ups and downs emotionally is a tour de force for Levitt.  Deschanel also shines but the character played by Levitt is more front and center.So this film is not the typical light romantic comedy fare a couple may go to the movies to see on their first date.  This film is a boy meets girl, boy gets girl and boy looses girl film and it is ok to know that for the film is about the emotional journey both characters go through as each of their perceptions of love and relationships are tested.  There are many true laughs here but the situations are funny because you can relate.  So this film is, as I stated, a true character study that delves deeply and honestly into two characters who fall into each others life and learn much about themselves.  I found the film unique, heartfelt and original very creatively put together in a way that better illustrated the emotions being seen.  Kudos to the actors, writers and director.The blu ray version is a delight with beautiful picture displaying vibrant colors and crisp clarity.  The audio is also of the highest quality.

1241910,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001UV4XUG,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","(500) Days of Summer is a bit interesting in that it's slightly funny, slightly dramatic, and slightly interesting.  It's a little bit of everything (strong emphasis on the *little* bit part).However, that's also the biggest flaw with the storyline- it tries to be all kinds of things, but in the end it only touches upon each of them for a short period of time.  So (500) Days of Summer ends up being just a pretty good film, but definitely not a great one.In the beginning (like the first 20 minutes or so) you'll probably think the film will develop into the most predictable kind of love story you can imagine (and in some ways, it does).It's about a young man who falls in love with a woman (Zooey Deschanel) that he works with, but the tricky thing is that the girl doesn't really want a relationship (or so it seems).  Instead, she just prefers to have fun and live life to its very fullest, etc, etc.  So the relationship between the two of them for the most part is all about having fun with each other like best friends normally would.Of course this doesn't sit well with the guy who definitely wants her to be his girlfriend.  From here the storyline kicks in, and we find out this girl is actually completely whacky.  Actually, on an unrelated note, Zooey Deschanel's character is *exactly* like the way she always is in other films.  You know, the shy, offbeat and awkward personality, but that's beside the point I suppose.Anyway, some of the storyline segments are fairly interesting such as a certain restaurant scene, a certain word the couple blurt out repeatedly at a local park picnic, and just the awkward way the man and woman communicate with each other.  It's weird, but I guess that's the point (so as not to fall for the typical love storyline we've seen thousands of times now).So yeah, it has its moments of laughter, drama, and entertainment.  It's a pretty satisfying movie.",4,interesting... but only midly so,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,1904,"['500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'bit', 'interesting', 'slightly', 'funny', 'slightly', 'dramatic', 'slightly', 'interesting', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'strong', 'emphasis', '*little*', 'part', '.However', 'also', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'storyline-', 'be', 'kinds', 'things', 'end', 'only', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'So', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'up', 'being', 'just', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'great', 'beginning', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'develop', 'most', 'predictable', 'kind', 'love', 'story', 'can', 'imagine', 'ways', '.It', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'woman', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'tricky', 'thing', 'girl', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'relationship', 'so', 'Instead', 'just', 'prefers', 'have', 'fun', 'live', 'life', 'very', 'fullest', 'etc', 'etc', 'relationship', 'two', 'most', 'part', 'having', 'fun', 'other', 'best', 'friends', 'normally', 'would.Of', 'course', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'guy', 'who', 'definitely', 'be', 'girlfriend', 'here', 'storyline', 'kicks', 'find', 'out', 'girl', 'actually', 'completely', 'whacky', 'Actually', 'unrelated', 'note', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'character', '*exactly*', 'way', 'always', 'other', 'films', 'know', 'shy', 'offbeat', 'awkward', 'personality', 'beside', 'point', 'suppose.Anyway', 'storyline', 'segments', 'are', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'such', 'certain', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'certain', 'word', 'couple', 'blurt', 'repeatedly', 'local', 'park', 'picnic', 'just', 'awkward', 'way', 'man', 'woman', 'communicate', 'other', 'weird', 'guess', 'point', 'so', 'not', 'fall', 'typical', 'love', 'storyline', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thousands', 'times', 'now', '.So', 'yeah', 'moments', 'laughter', 'drama', 'entertainment', 'pretty', 'satisfying', 'movie']",N/A

1241913,A30TQET02FLSUX,B001UV4XUG,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[5, 6]","FILM RATING: 5 starsREVISITED REVIEW (March 13, 2012):I don't think I'll ever tire of watching (500) Days of Summer (2009). It's a movie that's a part of the ""soundtrack"" of my life now...to use a music analogy. It takes me to a place emotionally that few films do...and it's a secret place that only a few know about (get the movie reference here?). This film just happened upon me at a time in my life when I was going through so many of the same experiences and feelings as ""Tom""...falling in love with someone who isn't in love with you...re-evaluating your career and life purpose...making that same kind of idealistic speech at work...and just getting comfortable in your own skin. And of course we've all experienced some of what Tom does in high school and college when we began to date. Screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber captured something special here. And if you didn't get it...then you're just not there yet to receive it. This is a story that probably speaks to thousands if not millions of young men...and young women...and just people of any age really. That's what makes (500) Days of Summer so special. It's a modern take on a ""true story"" of love and heartbreak like most of us have experienced. It's about learning how to deal with both the joys and tragedies that come with love & life, and opening your heart up to it. (500) Days of Summer makes fun of love and relationships like every rom-com, throwing in great jokes, but it also takes it very seriously and shows the real dramatic and tearful side as well.Director Marc Webb and his team of incredibly talented fellow filmmakers crafted an awesome film. This was one of the best movies of 2009 and one of the few I saw in the theater that year...Thank God! I've also seen it on Blu-ray and in HD on HBO most recently. My previous review of this flick covered some of my initial thoughts and feelings about the film. But now, over a year later, I can see how much this film has really stuck with me both as a cinephile and a young aspiring filmmaker. I put this film in my Top 100 Movies of all time back after I initially saw it in late 2009. And it remains there to this day. Webb was able to weave together so many different disconnected ideas and bits of irony from dating that just come together so well here. Having gone to high school with Marc Webb, I had no idea that he would someday be the man behind the vision of such a truly great film. I just remember his goofy smile and laugh in Algebra class at Madison West High School. Everyone seemed to like him...and vice versa. But for his feature film debut, Marc came out of the gate with his guns-a-blazing and I can't wait to see his take on The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) next year.Part of what the screenwriters do so well here is flip the tables on the typical relationship, putting Summer (played perfectly by Zooey Deschanel) in more of the ""guy role"" and Tom (played equally perfectly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) in more of the ""chic role"". Tom is the one who falls in love right away and Summer is the one who wants to keep things casual and not get into a relationship. It's a ""secret"" within the guy realm that we want what women want just as much or more than them sometimes. It's just that we make fun of each other if we admit it...so we usually don't...just like Tom's best friends. Also ""cute"" is how Tom's much younger little sister Rachel (played by Chloe Moretz) is much more mature and knowledgeable in the ways of love than he is. Usually its the older sibling that councils the younger one...but not here!Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt both capture their roles in (500) Days like I've never seen them before. Both were at the top of their acting game in this flick. They bring intelligence, wit, emotion, and fun to Tom and Summer. The casting of both of them was as PERFECT as it gets. I think probably the most unique and interesting part of (500) Days of Summer is how it jumbles the story into seemingly ""random"" days within the 500 days that these two characters shared together. This jumble of mini stories is edited together so well by lead Editor Alan Edward Ball that it just feels genius! By telling this story in a fresh, non-linear way, (500) Days sticks out from the packed crowd of similar rom-com flicks. I know from listening to Creative Screenwriting Magazine podcast with writer Scott Neustadter that this storytelling technique was part of the script early on. But in the hands of a lesser Editor, it might not have worked as well. The use of motion graphics that flip through the calendar days, the deep God-like voice-over narration, and the music selections, all bring the script and its real dialogue to life. Again, this was clearly an incredible aligning of many different team members on the film crew to a unique and singular vision that director Marc Webb brought to the team.The cinematography by Director of Photography Eric Steelberg is Fantastic! Paired with phenomenal production design by Laura Fox and Art Direction by Charles Varga, (500) Days of Summer is a visual feast. Every little detail just shines through, and when paired with the sound and music for the film, the perfect technical trifecta is hit! If you haven't yet fallen in love or had your heart broken and healed by (500) Days of Summer, then it's about time you took the chance and asked the picture out. What do you have to lose? There's a lot of fish in the sea, but this is the one for me.ORIGINAL REVIEW (January 16, 2010):One of my favorite movies from 2009 was this little indie romcom (romantic comedy).  It's not my usual kind of movie since most romcoms have little story, little character development, and little emotion.  But this movie has a heart and soul and mind that most romcoms (or chic flicks) simply don't.  It even sneaked into my Top100 movies of all time.  What's so interesting about this movie is that it's really a modern male-centric flick.  It's all about being a young guy falling in love with a free spirited girl who breaks your heart.  With the sexual revolution of the 60s up to today, the roles of men and women have swapped and many of today's men are really more of the ""woman"" in relationships.  They are the sweet, emotional, monogamous ones in the relationships with women who want to play the field and not be tied down.  I'm by no means saying that every guy or girl fits into this mold, but I think its more common today for my generation (Gen X) and younger  in our mixed bag culture of experimentation and growing up with strong mothers.  We're all learning how to become who we are instead of being told who we are as it used to be.  And as part of that search, what guy or girl can't relate to the experience of falling in love with someone and them not falling in love with you.  Heart break is part of maturity and coming of age these days and this movie handles it in a funny but sophisticated way that speaks to me as a guy.I've experienced EXACTLY what Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character Tom does in this movie...both in terms of career and relationships.  And I guess that's a huge part of what connected me to the story.  But of course being an architect, it's always cool when a movie involves an ""architect"" as Tom aspires to be.  He starts as a naive and idealistic greeting card writer who meets Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and falls for her.  As a filmmaker and storyteller, what really was ""cutting edge"" to me about this movie was the way the story was told.  It's a jumble of various ""days"" or moments in the relationship of Tom and Summer, jumping around from the beginning to the end and everything in the middle.  It's a clever way of showing the ups and downs of the rollercoaster that is every relationship.  And an intriguing way to tell a movie.  Even though the story jumps around, it still builds to a crescendo like most classic three-act stories.It's hard to compare this movie to The Hurt Locker or Avatar, which were the front runners in the Oscar race, but in my book, this should have been a contender for Best Picture 2009.  Check it out on DVD or Bluray if you haven't seen it yet.  And be ready to laugh and cry and experience everything in between.",5,I'm a guy that LOVES this Movie!!,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,8205,"['FILM', 'RATING', '5', 'starsREVISITED', 'REVIEW', 'March',

1241914,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B001UV4XUG,B. Martin,"[1, 1]","As the funny, heartfelt and thoroughly oringinal (500) Days of Summer begins, the film's narrator provides the audience with a quick summary of the two main characters and the circumstances that bring them together.  He then provides the following disclaimer, ""This is a story of boy meets girl, but this is not a love story"".  That simple statement brilliantly captures the essence of this ""romantic comedy"" that tracks the relationship of a young couple in Los Angeles.  The term romantic comedy is accurate in that this movie is a comedy and it is about a romantic relationship, but that's where the similarities end.The plot follows Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), who meet at the greeting card company where Tom has settled into a fairly safe and routine existence and given up on his dreams of being an architect and finding his soul mate.  But as fate would have it, Summer begins working at the company and Tom knows immediately that they are meant to be together.  As it turns out, fate has different plans.The narrative hook of the movie is that the events are told out of order.  The relationship spans the course of 500 days, but the movie jumps back and forth to various times during the couple's time together.  One minute we are watching them break up, the next we are witnessing their first encounter.  But before you can get comfortable, we're taken to a point in the fim where Tom is planning to get Summer back.  So it goes throughout the movie.  The effect should be one of disorientation, but the film feels surprisingly linear and is easy to follow.  The jumping around allows the audience to see a relationship as a whole; we get the good and the bad and everything in between.  We are not led to believe (as so many romantic comedies tend to do) that once a couple get together, it's smooth sailing.Everything works in this movie.  The performances by Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are pitch perfect, the writing is sharp and funny, the music is cool (thanks, Zooey) and the emotions are very real.  Trust me, this movie hits you hard despite the fact that it actually ends on a positive note that rewards Tom's hopeless romantic nature.(500) Days of Summer is a rare film indeed:  an honest ""relationship"" movie that never feels like one.

The movie that has the girl falling for the guy, then a dilemma develops, they fall apart, only to be brought back together by serendipity {play romantic chorus here}.Well this isn't that kind of movie, thank you very much...This is something newer, something I like to call ""a romantic guy flick."" No, it's not some horny dude looking to plop his thing into any attractive gal that comes along (Knocked Up) or some roadtrip movie gone awry (The Hangover). This is a story of unrequited love ...from the man's side. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (The Lookout) stars as Tom, a guy wanting nothing more than to fall in love with the girl of his dreams. And he believes he's found her in Summer (Zooey Deschanel,The Happening). Trouble is Summer only wants to be ""friends with benefits."" She tells Tom this from the get-go, but Tom's having none of it. He believes he can turn her toward him and onto a path of blissfulness.The film juxtaposes their 500 days together in a unique pattern: by traversing the days in a haphazard fashion, jumping from day 490 to day 39, then on to day 65 and back to day 1. This is representational of Tom's need to find out what went wrong with their relationship, as Summer breaks it off and devastates Tom. Or did anything go wrong? Perhaps Tom simply wasn't listening ...or being unrealistic in his expectations of Summer.Whatever the reason, many lonely guys out there will probably be able to identify with ""that girl that broke my heart"" syndrome that Tom goes through. This is what makes (500) DAYS OF SUMMER the guy flick I referred to earlier. It is frustrating, funny, and downright depressing. Doubly so when we see Summer hold hands with Tom even after there is no hope for them, further confounding Tom's sense of right and ...love.Even though there's a depressing air to the entire film, it does have its lighter moments thanks to two of Tom's buddies who are absolutely clueless about relationships yet offer their ridiculously bad advice to him. Tom's kid sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz) plays the sounding board and only person who seems to have a grip on what Tom really needs, which is a funny byline since she's basically a 12-year-old with the maturity level of a 20-something.The movie might have ended on a very sour note, further depressing anyone watching. But, in the end, we're given a small ray of sunshine that drifts away from Summer and helps lift Tom into a new season.

1241918,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B001UV4XUG,Brian C.,"[1, 1]","I think the best movies are movies that take a standard formulaic story or plot and are able to do something original with it. It seems, for example, like there are a lot of movies being made these days about heartbreak told from the male perspective, where the supposedly ""standard"" gender roles are reversed. It is the male character who is a hopeless romantic, who believes in true love, and is looking for his soul mate, while the female character just wants to keep things simple, and is afraid of anything smacking of too much commitment (no labels). This movie takes that somewhat standard material and does something fairly original, or at least interesting, with it.The movie is, I guess, technically a romantic comedy, but it is not your standard romantic comedy. Not that there is necessarily anything wrong with romantic comedies. I admit there are times when I have a fever that only a romantic comedy can cure, but before you judge me too harshly, you should know I can also bench press like 70 pounds...so...you know, there's that. I guess the point I am trying to make is that this movie will, I think, appeal even to those who do not ordinarily enjoy romantic comedies. It was quite funny in places, and the ""love story"" (I know it was not supposed to be a ""love story"") avoids most of the sentimentality that can be slightly nauseating in standard romantic comedies.I enjoyed that the story was told in a non-linear way. I am not sure why exactly, but I think it made the movie much more interesting. I think one reason might be because we are all so trained by now in what to expect from a movie like this that we can see what is coming a mile away. If this movie were told in a linear way there are really only two ways it could end. SPOILER ALERT: I give away the ending here. Either the guy winds up getting the girl in the end, or, she leaves him, and he is depressed for awhile, and then decides to finally follow through with that plan he has been holding off on for so long (in this case, to become an architect), and then, after he has got his life together, he meets someone else. This movie chose the latter option obviously, but the point is, if you start this story at the beginning there are really no surprises for the viewer since they already know it can only end one of two ways. By telling the story in a non-linear way you can have lots of surprises: How did they meet? What went wrong?, etc.. I know, reading my description, you are probably thinking: ""Wow! Two whole surprises!"" The fact is, there were more than two surprises, but I am suffering from a failure of imagination at the moment. Normally my brain is an endless stream of brilliant insights, but it seems to have momentarily dried up. I apologize.This review is going off the rails fast. Time to be serious. The acting in the movie was excellent. I really like Zooey Deschanel and she was perfect for this role. I also like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and I cannot resist putting in a plug here for one of his movies that I think is one of the best movies ever made. If you have not seenBrickdo yourself a favor and watch it. It is brilliant. Back to (500) Days of Summer. The movie is quite funny. I found myself laughing throughout.The movie also raises some interesting questions. For example, how, in the age of greeting cards, pop psychology, and romantic comedies, do we distinguish between our ""real"" feelings, and the way we think we are supposed to feel? How do we know that our feelings are genuine? I actually think this is a real problem in our culture. It was a good stroke having the main character work for a greeting card company since greeting cards tend to be associated with sentimentality and false emotion. Another interesting question raised by the movie, What is love? That might seem like too big of a question for a movie to deal with, and it is. One should not expect deep answers to the question from this movie. I also think that to really explore that question honestly the movie would have had to go much darker than I think it wanted to. I think that what most people call love is probably a mix of many things, and some of them are not necessarily positive (obsession, jealousy, possessiveness, etc.). Nevertheless, the movie raises the question in a way that I think most romantic comedies do not, even if it winds up giving a somewhat stock answer (""you know it when you feel it"").The one complaint I had with the movie is with the ending. SPOILER ALERT AGAIN (that's two spoiler alerts for those keeping count). The movie was so original in some ways, I was a little disappointed that the ending seemed fairly pedestrian. The main character has his heart broken, we see him in his depression, going to the store in his bathrobe, then we see the standard montage where he starts working on his architecture again, applying for jobs, and getting his life back on track. This is the standard formula. Heart break is the catalyst that finally forces people to pursue their dreams. We have all seen that story a million times. I realize that this is often what really happens in real life. It has happened to me twice. I had my heart broken and then finally decided to do something I had been wanting to do for years but was too lazy, too caught up in my own inertia, or whatever, and it eventually turned out that those heart breaks were really positive events in my life. So I understand why movies follow this script, but I was a little disappointed anyways and I will tell you why.There is a scene in the movie where Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character is sketching while watching his little sister play soccer. He has just had his heart broken and as soon as that scene came up I thought ""Here we go! He is going to get back into architecture and get his life back on track! I know exactly how this story is going to end, there are no more surprises."" Then it cut to what he was actually sketching and, to my surprise, it was a picture of Summer (Zooey Deschanel) holding a bloody knife, and a dead, bloody body in the background, and I thought, ""Yes! This movie forced me to jump to a hasty conclusion, and then stomped on it"". I really love it when movies do that, when they play with the expectations of the audience, and with the familiar tropes, in order to surprise. I was so happy to see that bloody knife (never thought I would say that again).But it was only temporary. The movie wound up going the traditional route in the end. It was not a huge problem for me. It certainly did not ruin the movie for me, and I cannot really imagine any other ending that would have been any more satisfying. I just got so excited when I thought they were going to dash my expectations that I was disappointed when they did not. All in all, I think this movie is definitely worth watching. Especially if you happen to have a fever that only a romantic comedy can cure.",4,Standard material handled well...,1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2012,6890,"['think', 'best', 'movies', 'are', 'movies',

Taylor,"[0, 0]","The two principals in this cute, romantic comedy, Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, are pleasant enough but Gordon-Levitt's acting ability extends far beyond the level of this picture.  In films such as The Lookout, Mysterious Skin and Brick, he really shows his stuff as a very professional and gifted actor.  I thought he was wasted in Inception, but I'm sure his salary was good.  Some crtics have said he was the best thing in The Dark Knight Rises.  His new film, Premium Rush, may be another substandard picture for him, but Leonard Maltin really liked it so I hope I'm wrong.  ""Looper"" may be a very good sci-fi film that is killed by a title that doesn't mean anything to anyone.  ""Jaws"" -- now that was a title that couldn't miss.(500) Days of Summer is structured in a way in which it keeps jumping around in time that may make it confusing to some viewers.  It reminds me superficially of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five that does the same sort of thing except in that story the character actually is jumping around in time beyond his conrol.

A big reason for this is the break up of her own parents' marriage.  That Tom works for a greeting card company devising cards about emotions  couldn't be a more fitting metaphor for the metamorphosis he is about to undergo.  They go together for awhile and then Summer breaks it off.  Tom is heart broken and wants to get her back.Summer (Deschanel) is lovely to look at with very beguiling manner.  You can see why Tom fell for her.  However, she can be offputting as well.  The character you really immerse yourself in is Tom, not Summer.This film does not go where you expect it to go.  It goes someplace better.  I can't say anymore without ruining it but you will love it from beginning to end.  It is a romance movie with a happy ever after ending but unlike any one you've ever seen before.  Its arty and indie roots show in every frame.  The film's visual palette is beautiful and often you feel as if the transitions between scenes become wonderful watercolor paintings.This is a quiet, thoughtful and reflective film.  There is no other plot other than young people coming together, falling in love or not and getting on with their lives.Deschanel also released an excellent album this year, SHE & HIM so this period in her professional life is the breakout one for her.

1241922,A1NSWV5MOGQ31A,B001UV4XUG,"Carrie Dunham-LaGree ""nomadreader""","[4, 11]","(500) Days of Summer is allegedly a quirky romantic comedy. It's actually the tale of a sad man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who falls in love with Summer (Zooey Deschanel) even though she tells him she's not into relationships. Then, of course, he gets mad at her for not wanting to be in a relationship and proceeds to mope. The film is slightly bearable because it's not told in chronological order. The narrative bounces between the happy days (double digits days of summer) to the miserable (far too many).It's clear I was not a fan of this film. I wanted to like it. I laughed a few times, but I never identified with any of the characters. Summer is presented as this magical being who has never paid full price for anything, even an apartment because everyone is so wowed by her. I didn't see it (no disrespect to Ms. Deschanel, who is lovely, but not so lovely to be the most perfect, idealized woman ever). She has no story in this film. She's new in town, and she has no friends of family, but she also has no depth. The entire film is the self-absorbed tale of Tom (Gordon-Levitt), but it comes off as an incredibly personal story that does not translate into the shared coming of age story and never has the passion to make it an accessible love story. It struck me as the story you write during month two of your broken heart that you later make fun of and ask your friends, ""why didn't you tell me how pathetic and desperate I sounded?,"" and they remind you that they did just that, but you wouldn't listen. Tom has two friends, one is Matthew Gray Gubler (Dr. Reid on Criminal Minds, one of my favorite shows) who plays the exact same character here.I don't even think I could recommend seeing this movie, and I know many people loved it.

1241923,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B001UV4XUG,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","(500) Days of Summer was kind of a role reversal where the girl, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), is afraid of commitment and just wants a casual friendship, or at most, friends with benefits; while Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) thinks he has found his soul mate, the mythical woman he has been searching for 'The One.' Summer is super attractive, as a montage, early on, informs us. When she worked in an ice cream parlor, sales where up 12%, and whenever she rented an apt it was 12.5% below market value, because men and landlords of all ages could not resist her charms. She wasn't my cup of oolong, but I could see why Tom would fall for her. Could also see how dumb and foolish Tom was being. That was half the fun. You'd think his character would grate on your nerves, because he was such a crybaby, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt really pulled off that amazing tightrope walk. Maybe it was his sweater vests...This was a very modern comedy. It was an Annie Hall for the new millennium. Like Annie Hall, it used a variety of narrative techniques, one being a narrator who sounds like a sociologist, who tells us upfront that this is not a love story. Another was that before every scene there are numbers denoting which day in the 500-day relationship it is. Uh oh, I thought. That could soon grow tiresome. It wasn't bad, though, because they didn't show every single tedious day in sequence, but rather jumped back and forth.Though mostly the movie glided along, hewing fairly close to a realistic albeit exceedingly clever and well-written reality, sometimes it veered wildly away from the humdrum. For instance, there is a dance number that even includes an animated blue bird. This was a high point of the film, Believe It Or Not. It is funny that Elvis Costello, though he didn't claim to have made it up, once said that rock journalists, or writing about music, was like dancing about architecture. Well, this movie has Tom, a greeting card writer by trade, who has a dream deferred about being an architect. In a way (500) days of Summer is also like dancing about architecture, but in a good way. When Tom is asked why he gave up architecture for greeting cards, he responds thusly:--------Tom: I guess I just figured, why make something disposable like a building when you can make something that lasts forever, like a greeting card.============Sometimes Tom looks directly at the camera and all but winks--briefly breaching the Fourth Wall--but only if it is some truly amazing coincidence that verges on cosmic significance. Speaking of cosmic significance, there are several coincidences in this film that would indicate that the screenwriter has been reading my mail, or at the very least, that he has acquired my infinite playlist. All the music choices were uncanny, though I won't go into why that is so. Suffice it to say that ""Sugar Town,"" the song Summer chose to sing at karaoke, made famous by Nancy Sinatra, written for her by Lee Hazelwood, figures prominently in my own saga, as does virtually ever single song on the soundtrack. ""Here Comes Your Man"" by The Pixies, ""Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want"" and ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"" by The Smiths, and ""Train in Vain"" by The Clash. Not quite as fraught with esoteric meaning, but still great musical choices were songs by Carla Bruni (First Lady of France, married to Nicolas Sarkosy), Patrick Swayze, Hall & Oates, Simon & Garfunkel, The Black Lips, Feist, & Regina Spektor. There are pop culture references galore, all on-target. Haven't seen the likes of it since Seinfeld brought his Pez Dispenser to that piano recital. Best Ikea reference since Fight Club. Tom is shown wearing not one, but two, Joy Division t-shirts!-----------------Tom: Man, no. No jobs. I'm still unemployed. We - we kissed.============Worthy of mention are Tom's support system consisting of Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler), who has been going out with his girl friend Robin since High School but gets a vicarious thrill from hearing about Tom's escapades; his little sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz), who acts more like his big brother, giving him tough love and good advice which he mostly ignores; and McKinzie (Geoffrey Arend), who hasn't gone out with anyone since a brief fling in High School, who also gets a vicarious thrill out of hearing about Tom's escapades:---------------McKinzie: Well, you know, Henry Miller said the best way to get over a woman is to turn her into literature=====================Bottom line: (500) Days of Summer is a delightful post-modern romantic comedy romp with great performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the delightful Zooey Deschanel. Though boy meets girl, he doesn't get girl, or at least he doesn't get to keep girl. Though Tom thinks that it is a tragedy, it was really a comedy, and one day he will look back and laugh. One suspects that, like Henry Miller, the screenwriters of (500) Days of Summer were getting over a woman by turning her into a great film, if not exactly into literature (not a judgment on their relative merits, merely acknowledging that they are different mediums).PS: Zooey Deschanel is a very talented singer with exquisite taste. Her favorite singer is Ella Fitzgerald. She is in a group with M. Ward, and also another cabaret group. In Elf, she sang ""Baby, It's Cold Outside,"" with Will Ferrell's elf. She is an interesting young lady who comes from a very hip family; in fact, she was named after a character in a J.D. Salinger novel. Though J.D. has recently passed on, Holden Caulfield, and the Glass Family, lives on.------------Tom: Hmmm. How about...""Every day you make me proud.

1241925,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B001UV4XUG,Charity Bishop,"[0, 0]","This is a story about love, but not a love story.That is the warning audiences receive when venturing into (500) Days of Summer, an interesting Independent film about a young man's struggle to overcome a broken relationship.They meet in the office. Summer (Zooey Deschanel) walks into the room as a new executive assistant at a greeting card company and stars explode around her, at least as far as Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is concerned. She likes his music, his movies, and was pretty as a picture. An eternal believer in true love, Tom knows at once that she is the one he has been waiting for his entire life... unfortunately, Summer is a practical girl scarred through memories of her parents' brutal divorce and doesn't believe in true love. Or even dating. It takes all Tom's wrangling just to get her to pay attention to him and then hang out sometimes. But just when he thinks their lives are approaching a monumental moment, Summer drops a bombshell on him: she doesn't see their relationship going anywhere and thinks they should both move on. Which apparently is easy for her, but not so much for Tom, who dwells on their unusual relationship in an attempt to figure out what went wrong.His employers put him to writing ""sympathy"" greeting cards in the hope he can eventually pull out of this funk, but in spite of his friends' encouragement to remember the bad aspects of his relationship as well as the good, Tom remains convinced that Summer is the one for him... and wonders what he can do to get her back. I admit that this movie had me fooled: midway through I was certain of the outcome but was proven wrong! It takes a non-traditional approach to the genre of romantic comedy and manages to be both funny and sentimental. It has a well-written script that captures ""real life"" very well -- the dialog is believable rather than being forced and it made me care about these people and their relationship. The approach is a bit tongue in cheek with the intention of being amusing but is also dealing with a very serious topic -- what happens after you break up? How do you overcome your emotions and move forward with your life? The message is that they might be the right person for you, but you might not be the right person for them. It's not a very pleasant notion but is what makes the film unique and sets it apart from other titles in the genre.Language is something of a problem with one f-word, several harsh abuses of deity (including one GD), and quite a few uses of the word s**t. On a dare, Tom and Summer sit in a crowded park and shout ""penis"" louder and louder until they draw everyone's attention. She later teasingly threatens to do it at a wedding. There are no graphic sex scenes, but they do some heavy kissing on a bed and the camera reveals part of her bare back. For fun, the two wander into the ""adult"" section of a rental store and decide to try out some of the moves they see on the film (we don't see the video but do watch a shower curtain jerking around before it falls on top of both of them). Other scenes imply she has spent the night, and sex is discussed a handful of times. Tom's friends make some crude references to breasts. There is a fair amount of drinking and several instances of intoxication.(500) Days of Summer is a movie you will either find unsatisfying due to its unusual ending or that will tickle your fancy. I appreciate ""odd"" stories and so this one appealed to me on many levels. The humor is well done and the characters actually mature and change throughout, which is refreshing to see. The cast is terrific even though most of them are not very well known, and the direction and style of the project is quirky. We constantly move back and forth in the relationship timeline with the assistance of helpful notations but it is never confusing. There's even a musical number in the middle of the film, complete with animated birds and everyone on the street joining in on the fun. It's a film without classification and its themes are both memorable and charming. Essentially, the audience is left with the realization that if you do not like who you are, it is within your power to change your life if you choose. It's a powerful message.",3,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,4218,"['story', 'love', 'not', 'love', 'warning', 'audiences', 'receive', 'when', 'venturing', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'interesting', 'Independent', 'film', 'young', 'man', 'struggle', 'overcome', 'broken', 'relationship.They', 'meet', 'office', 'Summer', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'room', 'new', 'executive', 'assistant', 'greeting', 'card', 'company', 'stars', 'explode', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'Tom', 'Hansen', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'concerned', 'music', 'movies', 'was', 'pretty', 'picture', 'eternal', 'believer', 'true', 'love', 'Tom', 'once', 'one', 'been', 'waiting', 'entire', 'life', 'unfortunately', 'Summer', 'practical', 'girl', 'scarred', 'memories', 'parents', 'brutal', 'divorce', ""n't"", 'believe', 'true', 'love', 'even', 'dating', 'Tom', 'wrangling', 'just', 'get', 'pay', 'attention', 'then', 'hang', 'out', 'sometimes', 'just', 'when', 'lives', 'are', 'approaching', 'monumental', 'moment', 'Summer', 'bombshell', ""n't"", 'see', 'relationship', 'going', 'anywhere', 'should', 'move', 'Which', 'apparently', 'easy', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Tom', 'who', 'unusual', 'relationship', 'attempt', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'went', 'wrong.His', 'employers', 'put', 'writing', 'sympathy', 'greeting', 'cards', 'hope', 'can', 'eventually', 'pull', 'funk', 'spite', 'friends', 'encouragement', 'remember', 'bad', 'aspects', 'relationship', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'Tom', 'convinced', 'Summer', 'one', 'wonders', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'get', 'back', 'admit', 'movie', 'had', 'fooled', 'midway', 'was', 'certain', 'outcome', 'was', 'proven', 'wrong', 'non-traditional', 'approach', 'genre', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'manages', 'be', 'funny', 'sentimental', 'well-written', 'script', 'real', 'life', 'very', 'well', 'dialog', 'believable', 'rather', 'being', 'forced', 'made', 'care', 'people', 'relationship', 'approach', 'bit', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'intention', 'being', 'amusing', 'also', 'dealing', 'very', 'serious', 'topic', 'what', 'break', 'up', 'How', 'do', 'overcome', 'emotions', 'move', 'forward', 'life', 'message', 'might', 'be', 'right', 'person', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'person', 'not', 'very', 'pleasant', 'notion', 'film', 'unique', 'apart', 'other', 'titles', 'genre.Language', 'something', 'problem', 'one', 'f-word', 'several', 'harsh', 'abuses', 'deity', 'including', 'one', 'GD', 'quite', 'few', 'uses', 'word', 's**t.', 'dare', 'Tom', 'Summer', 'sit', 'crowded', 'park', 'shout', 'penis', 'louder', 'louder', 'draw', 'everyone', 'attention', 'later', 'teasingly', 'do', 'wedding', 'are', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'do', 'heavy', 'kissing', 'bed', 'camera', 'part', 'bare', 'back', 'fun', 'two', 'wander', 'adult', 'section', 'rental', 'store', 'decide', 'try', 'out', 'moves', 'see', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'video', 'do', 'watch', 'shower', 'curtain', 'jerking', 'top', 'Other', 'scenes', 'spent', 'night', 'sex', 'discussed', 'handful', 'times', 'Tom', 'friends', 'make', 'crude', 'references', 'breasts', 'fair', 'amount', 'drinking', 'several', 'instances', 'intoxication', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'movie', 'will', 'either', 'find', 'unsatisfying', 'due', 'unusual', 'ending', 'will', 'tickle', 'fancy', 'appreciate', 'odd', 'stories', 'so', 'one', 'appealed', 'many', 'levels', 'humor', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'actually', 'mature', 'change', 'refreshing', 'see', 'cast', 'terrific', 'even', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'direction', 'style', 'project', 'quirky', 'constantly', 'move', 'back', 'forth', 'relationship', 'timeline', 'assistance', 'helpful', 'notations', 'never', 'confusing', 'even', 'musical', 'number', 'middle', 'film', 'complete', 'animated', 'birds', 'everyone', 'street', 'joining', 'fun', 'film', 'classification', 'themes', 'are', 'memorable', 'charming', 'Essentially', 'audience', 'left', 'realization', 'do', 'not', 'who', 'are', 'power', 'change', 'life', 'choose', 'powerful', 'message']",N/A

The story of their relationship is told in non-chronological order, including a few highly original scenes such as Tom turning the streets of LA into a chorus line following his first night with Summer. You know from the start that Tom and Summer are bound to split up. But the movie comes together nicely in the end, showing that when one story ends another is bound to begin.One thing I really like about this movie is that's it's the guy who is the hopeless romantic and the girl who remains emotionally distant. This contrast with the usual male-female stereotypes is refreshing and something I experienced myself when I was a young man. The movie is also quite nuanced and contains numerous references to classic literature, classic films and classic rock. In other words, it's way smarter than the usual Hollywood romantic comedy. It's also more funny and had me laughing out loud on several occassions. I do have to admit that the non-chronological sequencing of the 500 days left me dizzy at times and how much you like this movie will depend, to some extent, on how much you can identify with the main characters.

1241928,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001UV4XUG,Chris Pandolfi,"[164, 178]","""(500) Days of Summer"" is a wonderfully refreshing experience, a romantic comedy that doesn't follow the rules of a romantic comedy. It's inventive, intelligent, and engaging, a story of the dualities a young man lives with on a daily basis. On the one hand, there's the duality between falling in love and believing that love doesn't exist; Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) grew up believing in fate bringing soul mates together whereas Summer (Zooey Deschanel) grew up not believing in much of anything, least of all lasting relationships. On the other hand, there's the duality between what one would like to happen and what actually does happen; we often go through life with expectations, even though we know deep down that most will never be met. Tom is in a tug-of-war between his romantic fantasies and the reality that Summer doesn't believe in true love.Levitt's performance is a revelation. He plays Tom with sincerity. Tom is approachable and good natured, highly confident yet not so above-it-all that he can't be desperate and miserable at times. He writes greeting cards for a living but has always dreamed of becoming an architect, and he often finds inspiration from the Los Angeles skyscrapers that surround him. His story unfolds in much the same way a memory does, with fragments that pop up all out of sequence until the reality of those 500 days become clear. Some may be confused by this, but keep in mind that memory and chronological order never go hand in hand. This is especially true when reflecting on a relationship. Tom continuously thinks back trying to make sense of it all, only to end up considering the possibility that Summer was right all along.Deschanel, who seemed so awkward in films like ""Yes Man"" and ""The Happening,"" here is perfectly cast. Summer is charming, fun, and sweet, but she's also mysterious, distant, and casual about life. She dates Tom and even makes love to him, yet she will never see him as anything more than a friend. She's with him not because she's in love--she's just having fun while living in the moment. It's about all she can do given the fact that she can't love anything, save for the length of her hair and the fact that she can cut it off without feeling anything. There are a few select moments, however, when she connects with Tom at a more personal level, inviting him into her artsy apartment and eventually opening up about past experiences. This makes Tom feel appreciated, as he believes, perhaps correctly, that she doesn't go this far with too many people.By the end of the film, Tom feels like someone we've gotten to know. Summer, on the other hand, remains enigmatic, underscoring the uncertainty engrained in any kind of relationship. There are times when Tom thinks he has her figured out. There are other times when it seems as if they've never even met. Loving relationships are based on compromises, and while Tom would be willing to make a few, Summer most definitely would not. She does what she wants when she wants it. This is admirable, but when matters of the heart are involved, the line does need to be drawn somewhere.Tom's emotional roller coaster ride occasionally gets the visual treatment. In one scene, he becomes the star of a musical number featuring dancers and a cartoon bluebird. In another scene, he imagines himself as characters in black and white European art house films by Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. The single most creative shot has him standing in the middle of the street while the buildings transform into an architectural sketch, much like the one he drew on Summer's arm. Director Marc Webb treats these scenes not as showcases of special effects but as special moments of heightened reality, which is fitting given the battle waged between what Tom desires and what he actually gets. The most obvious interpretation of this theme is a split-screen image late in the film, one side marked ""Expectations,"" the other side marked ""Reality.""These extra touches make this movie enjoyable, but its Gordon and Deschanel that make it a joy to watch. They have chemistry. You believe in them as actual people and not merely as characters. They show just how talented they are as actors, although credit must also be given to Webb's direction and the screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. They breathe life into ""(500) Days of Summer,"" a film we're told right off the bat is not a love story. Nor should it be; we've seen love stories before, and while they more or less work as entertaining distractions, rarely do they provide insight or even traces of plausibility. This movie is more ambitious than that. It aims to tell a story without resorting to cheap gimmicks like clich&eacute; dialogue or contrived plotlines. The end result is a story that's often funny, often thoughtful, and always compelling.",5,"He Loves Me, She Loves Me Not",1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,4838,"['500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'wonderfully', 'refreshing', 'experience', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'follow', 'rules', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'inventive', 'intelligent', 'engaging', 'story', 'dualities', 'young', 'man', 'daily', 'basis', 'one', 'hand', 'duality', 'falling', 'love', 'believing', 'love', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Tom', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'grew', 'up', 'believing', 'fate', 'bringing', 'soul', 'together', 'whereas', 'Summer', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'grew', 'up', 'not', 'believing', 'much', 'anything', 'least', 'lasting', 'relationships', 'other', 'hand', 'duality', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'happen', 'what', 'actually', 'happen', 'often', 'go', 'life', 'expectations', 'even', 'know', 'deep', 'down', 'most', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'met', 'Tom', 'tug-of-war', 'romantic', 'fantasies', 'reality', 'Summer', ""n't"", 'believe', 'true', 'love.Levitt', 'performance', 'revelation', 'Tom', 'sincerity', 'Tom', 'approachable', 'good', 'natured', 'highly', 'confident', 'yet', 'not', 'so', 'above-it-all', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'desperate', 'miserable', 'times', 'greeting', 'cards', 'living', 'always', 'dreamed', 'becoming', 'architect', 'often', 'inspiration', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'skyscrapers', 'surround', 'story', 'unfolds', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'memory', 'fragments', 'pop', 'up', 'sequence', 'reality', '500', 'days', 'become', 'clear', 'may', 'be', 'confused', 'keep', 'mind', 'memory', 'chronological', 'order', 'never', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'especially', 'true', 'when', 'reflecting', 'relationship', 'Tom', 'continuously', 'back', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'considering', 'possibility', 'Summer', 'was', 'right', 'along.Deschanel', 'who', 'seemed', 'so', 'awkward', 'films', 'Yes', 'Man', 'Happening', 'here', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Summer', 'charming', 'fun', 'sweet', 'also', 'mysterious', 'distant', 'casual', 'life', 'Tom', 'even', 'love', 'yet', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'more', 'friend', 'not', 'love', 'just', 'having', 'fun', 'living', 'moment', 'can', 'do', 'given', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'love', 'anything', 'save', 'length', 'hair', 'fact', 'can', 'cut', 'off', 'feeling', 'anything', 'are', 'few', 'select', 'moments', 'however', 'when', 'Tom', 'more', 'personal', 'level', 'inviting', 'artsy', 'apartment', 'eventually', 'opening', 'up', 'past', 'experiences', 'Tom', 'feel', 'appreciated', 'perhaps', 'correctly', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'people.By', 'end', 'film', 'Tom', 'feels', 'someone', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'know', 'Summer', 'other', 'hand', 'enigmatic', 'underscoring', 'uncertainty', 'engrained', 'kind', 'relationship', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Tom', 'figured', 'out', 'are', 'other', 'times', 'when', ""'ve"", 'never', 'even', 'met', 'Loving', 'relationships', 'are', 'based', 'compromises', 'Tom', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'make', 'few', 'Summer', 'most', 'definitely', 'would', 'not', 'what', 'when', 'admirable', 'when', 'matters', 'heart', 'are', 'involved', 'line', 'need', 'be', 'drawn', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'occasionally', 'visual', 'treatment', 'one', 'scene', 'star', 'musical', 'number', 'featuring', 'dancers', 'cartoon', 'bluebird', 'scene', 'characters', 'black', 'white', 'European', 'art', 'house', 'films', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Federico', 'Fellini', 'single', 'most', 'creative', 'shot', 'standing', 'middle', 'street', 'buildings', 'transform', 'architectural', 'sketch', 'much', 'one', 'drew', 'Summer', 'arm', 'Director', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'scenes', 'not', 'showcases', 'special', 'effects', 'special', 'moments', 'heightened', 'reality', 'fitting', 'given', 'battle', 'waged', 'what', 'Tom', 'what', 'actually', 'most', 'obvious', 'interpretation', 'theme', 'split-screen', 'image', 'late', 'film', 'one', 'side', 'marked', 'Expectations', 'other', 'side', 'marked', 'Reality', 'extra', 'touches', 'make', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'Gordon', 'Deschanel', 'make', 'joy', 'watch', 'have', 'chemistry', 'believe', 'actual', 'people', 'not', 'merely', 'characters', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'talented', 'are', 'actors', 'credit', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'given', 'Webb', 'direction', 'screenplay', 'Scott', 'Neustadter', 'Michael', 'H.', 'Weber', 'breathe', 'life', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'film', ""'re"", 'told', 'right', 'bat', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'should', 'be', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'love', 'stories', 'more', 'less', 'work', 'entertaining', 'distractions', 'rarely', 'do', 'provide', 'insight', 'even', 'traces', 'plausibility', 'movie', 'more', 'ambitious', 'tell', 'story', 'resorting', 'cheap', 'gimmicks', 'clich', 'eacute', 'dialogue', 'contrived', 'plotlines', 'end', 'result', 'story', 'often', 'funny', 'often', 'thoughtful', 'always', 'compelling']",N/A

Huh, I wondered, what is THAT supposed to mean....it looks exactly like a love story....Well, what it is is a refreshingly, offbeat film about two people, Tom and Summer, who both work at a greeting card company.  She is the Executive Assistant and he is a would-be architect who instead writes greeting cards.  The chemistry is almost immediate and you root for them to be together, but again, you remember ""this is not a love story"".  The 500 days that Tom is with Summer are portrayed in flashbacks in random order.  I know, for some people this is too weird, and they are already turned off.  I liked it though, it was a different approach and in all the romantic comedies and movies in general I tend to like movies that don't necessarily stay with the standard formula.  It kept me watching through their good days and their bad.  Their growing together and apart.The one thing that I liked about this movie was the message that people come into your life for a reason.  Tom I'm sure thought Summer's reason was because they were destined to be together, because that is what he so badly wanted, but that was not the reason why she came into his life, or why he came into hers.  The last 15 minutes of the film tie everything up beautifully for a satisfying ending, though not one you expected at the beginning of the movie.  Both Zooey Deschanel as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt do a great job in their roles.  The chemistry is definitely there, she is interesting to watch and a bit on the quirky side.I'll be honest, I loved this one enough to buy it after I watched it.  Is it a girly, relationship movie?  Well, duh....of course, but I like girly relationship movies, especially ones that are cleverly written that are interesting to watch that take me out of the usual ""romantic comedy"" formula.A fun, sassy movie for you and your girlfriends to watch while the guys have a little ""garage"" time.",5,"""not a love story""-a refreshing romantic comedy....",1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,2034,"['recently', 'borrowed', 'movie', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'narrator', 'saying', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'Huh', 'wondered', 'what', 'supposed', 'mean', 'exactly', 'love', 'story', '.Well', 'what', 'refreshingly', 'offbeat', 'film', 'two', 'people', 'Tom', 'Summer', 'who', 'work', 'greeting', 'card', 'company', 'Executive', 'Assistant', 'would-be', 'architect', 'who', 'instead', 'greeting', 'cards', 'chemistry', 'almost', 'immediate', 'root', 'be', 'together', 'again', 'remember', 'not', 'love', 'story', '500', 'days', 'Tom', 'Summer', 'are', 'portrayed', 'flashbacks', 'random', 'order', 'know', 'people', 'too', 'weird', 'are', 'already', 'turned', 'off', 'liked', 'was', 'different', 'approach', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'movies', 'general', 'tend', 'like', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'stay', 'standard', 'formula', 'kept', 'watching', 'good', 'days', 'bad', 'growing', 'together', 'apart.The', 'one', 'thing', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'message', 'people', 'come', 'life', 'reason', 'Tom', ""'m"", 'sure', 'thought', 'Summer', 'reason', 'was', 'were', 'destined', 'be', 'together', 'what', 'so', 'badly', 'wanted', 'was', 'not', 'reason', 'why', 'came', 'life', 'why', 'came', 'hers', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'tie', 'everything', 'up', 'beautifully', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'not', 'one', 'expected', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'as', 'well', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'chemistry', 'definitely', 'there', 'interesting', 'watch', 'bit', 'quirky', 'side.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'loved', 'one', 'enough', 'buy', 'watched', 'girly', 'relationship', 'movie', 'Well', 'duh', '.of', 'course', 'like', 'girly', 'relationship', 'movies', 'especially', 'ones', 'are', 'cleverly', 'written', 'are', 'interesting', 'watch', 'take', 'usual', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'formula.A', 'fun', 'sassy', 'movie', 'girlfriends', 'watch', 'guys', 'have', 'little', 'garage', 'time']",N/A

1241937,A1NCPGUX2M8JQ7,B001UV4XUG,David E. Hartman,"[14, 15]","This movie nails three things.  That's all you need to know(1) that first rush of love and passion.  The movie's fantasy dance sequence after Tom (Gordon-Levitt) falls for Summer (Deschanel) and that idiotic happiness is just the way it feels .. . I've never seen it done better.(2) the anger and frustration when it's clear that there is an emotional disconnect between the characters; Tom again - perfect.(3) The pain of withdrawal and slow recovery - make no mistake, this is love addiction where a character goes cold turkey.  It's tough to watch.I don't know if women relate to this movie in the same way, but this is a movie that is A Good Guy's perspective on finding and losing love without ever really knowing the woman whom he loves and why it doesn't work.  As such, Zooey's Summer is an appropriately opaque character.  Her feelings, motives intentions, etc., are all below the surface; there are just those amazingly melting eyes.  You could argue that her character could be more fully developed, but realistically, I think her character allows Tom to see all that Guys are able to see.  Summer and Tom make a good argument for women and men being different species that happen to be genetically capable of reproducing.  They are not Mars and Venus; they are more like Mercury and Pluto.  Even at their final accidental meeting, Tom is no closer to understanding Summer than he was when he first met her, and it's still not clear how she feels about anything.  Zooey's character has a secret heart that is just unknowable to Tom, to the viewer; maybe to Summer as well.The disjointed, non-linear structure of the movie make the pain easier to tolerate; just a little at a time.  It feels like the way you remember a relationship.  So five stars for a wonderful and unusual movie.  For guys, I think, it's also a True story.

1241939,A8N5EM32PVLZJ,B001UV4XUG,Dean A. Anderson,"[3, 4]","""She's better than my dream girl. She's real.""That is my favorite line from a film filled with a lot of clever dialogue, (500) Days of Summer. It's spoken by Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) to an unseen interviewer when asked about his long time relationship with his girl friend. He first goes into a long list of the ideal qualities of his Perfect Woman. But then acknowledges he prefers reality.It's a key point in this film, which, as its tag line says, ""is not a love story. This is a story about love."" Or as the other tag line says, ""Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."" The film chronicles the 500 days of a young man named Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) in his pursuit of a girl named Summer (Zooey Deschanel).  Those days are not presented in chronological order, which is one of many stylized features of this clever comedy.Tom believes in true love, and Summer scoffs at the idea. He believes there is one perfect girl that he will find and then all of life will fit together. Summer is just looking for a good time. Tom becomes convinced that Summer is his perfect girl and that they are meant for each other. Throughout the film, Tom tries to convince Summer he is right.The thing I loved about this film is that it skewers many of our society's false ideas about love and romance.Tom believes in a love at first sight, that one can trust one's feelings to know one's life partner. While it is true that initial attraction can lead to something more, immediate attraction (the pull of hormones) isn't necessarily trustworthy. God's wisdom leads us to rely not just on our feelings, but also our minds and His Spirit for direction in such important decisions in our lives.Summer believes there is no such thing as love. She observed the loveless marriage and subsequent divorce of her parents, and doesn't believe that people really can care for more than their own needs and desires. Sadly, many in our society have come to believe that narcissism is the only real option for life. Summer learns from her relationship with Tom that there may be something more.The couple enters into a sexual relationship quite early in their relationship. Our  culture claims that this is no big deal, but the film shows that a sexual relationship without commitment has serious consequences. Inevitably, one person will believe such a step means more than the other. Seeing the pain this causes Tom reminds us that God did not call us to wait until marriage for sex because He is a killjoy. Sex was made for the context of safety found in a committed, exclusive relationship.Sorry about being a little slow here. (500) Days of Summer came out in the summer but I just got to it a couple of weeks ago. But the movie has hung on in the theaters for months, having gathered a bit a cult following. It's listed, as I write this, at #197 of the top 250 films of all time at IMDB (Internet Movie Data Base... remember though, this list is voted on chiefly by young computer geeks). Its following comes from solid performances, a smart script by Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber and innovative direction from Marc Webb.But I appreciated it most for showing what love is not. We, fortunately, can go to God and His Word to find out what it is.",4,"Not Finding Love in ""500 Days of Summer""",1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,3240,"['better', 'dream', 'girl', 'real', 'favorite', 'line', 'film', 'filled', 'lot', 'clever', 'dialogue', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'spoken', 'Paul', 'Matthew', 'Gray', 'Gubler', 'unseen', 'interviewer', 'when', 'asked', 'long', 'time', 'relationship', 'girl', 'friend', 'first', 'long', 'list', 'ideal', 'qualities', 'Perfect', 'Woman', 'then', 'reality.It', 'key', 'point', 'film', 'tag', 'line', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'story', 'love', 'other', 'tag', 'line', 'Boy', 'girl', 'Boy', 'love', 'Girl', ""n't"", 'film', '500', 'days', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Tom', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'pursuit', 'girl', 'named', 'Summer', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'days', 'are', 'not', 'presented', 'chronological', 'order', 'one', 'many', 'stylized', 'features', 'clever', 'comedy.Tom', 'true', 'love', 'Summer', 'scoffs', 'idea', 'one', 'perfect', 'girl', 'will', 'find', 'then', 'life', 'will', 'fit', 'together', 'Summer', 'just', 'looking', 'good', 'time', 'Tom', 'convinced', 'Summer', 'perfect', 'girl', 'are', 'meant', 'other', 'film', 'Tom', 'convince', 'Summer', 'right.The', 'thing', 'loved', 'film', 'many', 'society', 'false', 'ideas', 'love', 'romance.Tom', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'one', 'can', 'trust', 'one', 'feelings', 'know', 'one', 'life', 'partner', 'true', 'initial', 'attraction', 'can', 'lead', 'something', 'more', 'immediate', 'attraction', 'pull', 'hormones', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'trustworthy', 'God', 'wisdom', 'rely', 'not', 'just', 'feelings', 'also', 'minds', 'Spirit', 'direction', 'such', 'important', 'decisions', 'lives.Summer', 'such', 'thing', 'love', 'observed', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'subsequent', 'divorce', 'parents', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'really', 'can', 'care', 'more', 'own', 'needs', 'desires', 'Sadly', 'many', 'society', 'have', 'come', 'believe', 'narcissism', 'only', 'real', 'option', 'life', 'Summer', 'relationship', 'Tom', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'more.The', 'couple', 'enters', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'quite', 'early', 'relationship', 'culture', 'big', 'deal', 'film', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'commitment', 'serious', 'consequences', 'Inevitably', 'one', 'person', 'will', 'believe', 'step', 'more', 'other', 'Seeing', 'pain', 'Tom', 'God', 'did', 'not', 'call', 'wait', 'marriage', 'sex', 'killjoy', 'Sex', 'was', 'made', 'context', 'safety', 'found', 'committed', 'exclusive', 'relationship.Sorry', 'being', 'little', 'slow', 'here', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'came', 'out', 'summer', 'just', 'got', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'movie', 'hung', 'theaters', 'months', 'having', 'gathered', 'bit', 'cult', 'following', 'listed', 'write', '197', 'top', '250', 'films', 'time', 'IMDB', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'Data', 'Base', 'remember', 'list', 'voted', 'chiefly', 'young', 'computer', 'geeks', 'following', 'solid', 'performances', 'smart', 'script', 'Scott', 'Neustadter', 'Michael', 'Weber', 'innovative', 'direction', 'Marc', 'Webb.But', 'appreciated', 'most', 'showing', 'what', 'love', 'not', 'fortunately', 'can', 'go', 'God', 'Word', 'find', 'out', 'what']",N/A

Amith (kndy),"[4, 5]","For producers, Mark Waters (director of ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"", ""Mean Girls"", ""Freaky Friday"") and Jessica Tuchinksy, it was all about finding the best original script.  And its when they found a screenplay fir ""(500) Days of Summer"" by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (both wrote the script for ""The Pink Panther 2'), that they new they had something special.With director Marc Webb (""Seascape"", ""Jesse McCartney: Up Close""), cinematographer Eric Steelburg (""Juno"", ""Numb""), music by composers Mychael Danna (""The Time Travelers Wife"", ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"") and Rob Simonsen (""Sophie Sapna"", ""Management"") and adding the talents Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""The Lookout"", ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"", ""10 Things I Hate About You"") and Zooey Deschanel (""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"", ""The Happening"").The independent film which cost about $7.5 million to make, was screened at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and was an instant hit with the audience that it was picked up for distribution by Fox Searchlight Pictures and when the film went public in theaters, ""(500) Days of Summer"" would make around $40 million worldwide.  The film would go on to receive numerous awards and nominations and now the film receives its Blu-ray and DVD release, with the Blu-ray coming with a digital copy of the film.VIDEO & AUDIO:""(500) Days of Summer"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 Widescreen), AVC @ 33 MBPS.  For the most part, picture quality is well done.  The details on the walls, skin tones are natural, blacks are black but its very important to note that the director Marc Webb was very particular with the color palette.  In the special features, he wanted to make sure that certain characters had certain colors.For example, only when you see Summer will you see the color blue.  When you see Tom, you will see more grays.  He was quite picky on what colors would be seen in the film and what colors he didn't want to see as much of.  So, primary colors are somewhat muted deliberately.  The film has a fine layer of grain and overall, the film is quite solid when it comes to PQ.As for audio quality, lossless audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and also includes an English description for the visually impaired, 5.1 Dolby Digital in Spanish, French and Portuguese.  This film is a romantic comedy that has an emphasis on music.  Dialogue is clear and understandable from the center channel, while music can be heard from the front channels.  There is very little use of the surround channels.  Mostly crowd ambiance but nothing major.  The audio quality is satisfactory for this kind of film.Subtitles are provided in English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES:""(500) Days of Summer"" comes with the following special features:* Audio Commentary by Director Marc Webb, writers Michael H. Weber and Scott Neustadter and Actor Joseph Gordon Levitt - A humorous, fun, upbeat and informative commentary track.* Lost Days of Summer: Deleted and Extended Scenes - Featuring nine deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary by director Marc Webb, writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H.

It's storytelling using the days and going back and forth through linear and non-linear storyline definitely makes this film structurally innovative.But without going the direction of making this romantic comedy too mature or cliche, I found the pop culture references to be quite fantastic.  From Tom listening to depressing UK music, for anyone who grew up listening to the Smiths or Depeche Mode can only laugh and be amused by Tom's character.  And music plays a big part in the enjoyment of ""(500) Days of Summer"" as Tom who starts to fall for Summer starts playing The Smiths ""Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want"" on his computer to him and his friends singing at karaoke or listening to music that plays while they drive in their car and a memorable musical scene as Tom has his first sexual experience and prompts him to take part in a musical dance experience to Hall & Oates ""You Make My Dreams"".But as the film showcases music through hearing it, seeing it on the t-shirts of Tom's character to how these characters embody music (note: both Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel outside of acting are also accomplished musicians or in a band), cinemaphiles can also enjoy the various references to films such as ""The Graduate"" and for those familiar with films by Fellini, Truffaut and Bergman.  I felt the film's using clips from these films was wonderful, especially how Tom and Summer have different interpretations of the ending of ""The Graduate"".There are very interesting stylistic choices that Marc Webb took in ""(500) Days of Summer"" but in the end, everything works.  Both Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry and their performance in the film is fantastic.  Almost similar to a Godard or even a Rohmer film, there are many short scenes that stay in your mind and you can't help but adore them.  From Tom and Summer having fun at IKEA to them sitting at the park screaming ""penis"", it's something that you would see from French New Wave films from the 1960's and used quite well in this film.As for the Blu-ray release, there are plenty of special features that fans of the film will truly enjoy.  The fact that both talents also partake in parody's of ""Sid and Nancy"" and even do a musical dance scene in ""Bank Dance"", just shows how much fun the filmmakers and the talent had with each other.  From the making of the film to documenting the screening of the film at Sundance was another wonderful addition.  And as for picture and audio quality, again...stylistic risks that Webb employed in removing the primaries and selecting which colors he wanted to use in the film was quite interesting and the use of music in the film was well-done.Overall, I found ""(500) Days of Summer"" to be a remarkable film.  I know some of my cinemaphile acquaintances tend to compare this film with the classic Woody Allen film ""Annie Hall"" or Gondry's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and to pick apart its ideology and then some who call this an indie love film that serves purpose for a new generation.  Personally, I looked at this film as a true and honest film similar to a ""Say Anything"" about relationships and breakups but not having to go with the typical story cliche.  When I saw the ending reference to ""The Graduate"" which was featured in this film, the first thing that came to my mind is that I hope the writers and the director are going to keep things real and not become the typical romantic comedy that we've seen many times before.  The director and writers already took creative risks, stylistic choices, added many twists and turns and even the La Nouvelle Vague references made me want something different and sure enough it happened.  And in the end I was more than satisfied.""(500) Days of Summer"" is highly recommended!",5,Blu-ray: I really enjoyed this film!!!

With this line I knew I was about to see something a little bit different.  It's the story of Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a hopeless romantic who falls for Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), a cynic who doesn't believe in true love.Going into this, I had read the reviews and most being positive I thought Okay this is going to be one of those rare smart well made Rom-Coms.  When I heard the above quote I rethought my stance a bit but still expected the typical boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back and all live happily ever after.  (500) Days of Summer not only doesn't stick to this formula, it plants it with a C-4 charge and destroys it.  I don't want to include any spoilers, but right from the start the movie turns you on your ear and you literally spend the entire film flip flopping from the elation that comes from falling in and being in love to the feeling of just misery for those weeks and weeks after being dumped by this person you literally thought was THE ONE.  This movie portrays that better than any film I've ever seen.  Another thing it does outstandingly well is to display how love blinds you.  It achieves this by replaying scenes that were previously shown and it is amazing the things you notice the second time around.  Probably my favorite scene is one that almost everyone can relate too.  The scene that juxtaposes beautifully Tom's expectations and reality.  It is the scene where essentially all hope is lost and Tom's heart is broken seemingly beyond repair.  I'm confident in saying that if that scene doesn't strike a chord with you then you've never lost at love.The comedy is ably supplied by Tom's friends McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler).  Although one of the funniest ""themes"" in the film is how Tom goes to his approx 12-13 year old sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz) for relationship advice and actually gets more sound advice from her than from anyone else.  In fact it is her advice that actually saves him in the end from a lifetime of lonliness and wondering what he could have done differently.Overall (500) Days of Summer is nearly pitch perfect, and will have you reaching the highest of highs and almost hitting the lowest of lows but not quite.  It is a rare romantic comedy that is told from the male perspective without being crass.  It shows how men can be and often are hurt.  Even if we try not to show it.  If you are a fan of typical rom-coms this may not be for you, but I'll say this.  I am no fan of rom-coms and I loved this movie.",4,Not your typical Romantic Comedy,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,2670,"['story', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'should', 'know', 'up', 'front', 'NOT', 'love', 'story', 'So', 'narrator', 'right', 'outset', 'line', 'knew', 'was', 'about', 'see', 'something', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'story', 'Tom', 'Hansen', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'who', 'Summer', 'Finn', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'cynic', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'true', 'love.Going', 'had', 'read', 'reviews', 'most', 'being', 'positive', 'thought', 'Okay', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'rare', 'smart', 'well', 'made', 'Rom-Coms', 'When', 'heard', 'above', 'quote', 'rethought', 'stance', 'bit', 'still', 'expected', 'typical', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'back', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'stick', 'formula', 'plants', 'C-4', 'charge', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'include', 'spoilers', 'right', 'start', 'movie', 'ear', 'literally', 'spend', 'entire', 'film', 'flip', 'flopping', 'elation', 'falling', 'being', 'love', 'feeling', 'just', 'misery', 'weeks', 'weeks', 'being', 'dumped', 'person', 'literally', 'thought', 'was', 'ONE', 'movie', 'better', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'thing', 'outstandingly', 'well', 'display', 'how', 'love', 'replaying', 'scenes', 'were', 'previously', 'shown', 'amazing', 'things', 'notice', 'second', 'time', 'Probably', 'favorite', 'scene', 'one', 'almost', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'too', 'scene', 'beautifully', 'Tom', 'expectations', 'reality', 'scene', 'where', 'essentially', 'hope', 'lost', 'Tom', 'heart', 'broken', 'seemingly', 'repair', ""'m"", 'confident', 'saying', 'scene', ""n't"", 'strike', 'chord', 'then', ""'ve"", 'never', 'lost', 'love.The', 'comedy', 'ably', 'supplied', 'Tom', 'friends', 'McKenzie', 'Geoffrey', 'Arend', 'Paul', 'Matthew', 'Gray', 'Gubler', 'one', 'funniest', 'themes', 'film', 'how', 'Tom', 'approx', '12-13', 'year', 'old', 'sister', 'Rachel', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'relationship', 'advice', 'actually', 'more', 'sound', 'advice', 'anyone', 'else', 'fact', 'advice', 'actually', 'end', 'lifetime', 'lonliness', 'wondering', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'differently.Overall', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'nearly', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'will', 'have', 'reaching', 'highest', 'highs', 'almost', 'hitting', 'lowest', 'lows', 'not', 'quite', 'rare', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'told', 'male', 'perspective', 'being', 'crass', 'how', 'men', 'can', 'be', 'often', 'are', 'hurt', 'Even', 'try', 'not', 'show', 'are', 'fan', 'typical', 'rom-coms', 'may', 'not', 'be', ""'ll"", 'say', 'am', 'fan', 'rom-coms', 'loved', 'movie']",N/A
1241944,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B001UV4XUG,D. Hartley,"[2, 3]","Some people have compared director Marc Webb's Sundance darling ""500 Days of Summer"" to ""Annie Hall"". While it obviously draws narrative inspiration from Allen's post-deconstruction of a fizzled romantic relationship, it offers a fluffier, albeit ingratiating variation on that film's theme, buoyed along by a hip (if calculating) soundtrack, winking references for film buffs, and the charm of its two leads.At the beginning of the film, we are duly advised in mock-serious tones by a narrator with mellifluous pipes that what we are about to see is ""...not a love story."" It is, rather, a retrospective appraisal of a relationship that didn't work out, between a hopelessly romantic young man named Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and a more cautiously pragmatic young woman named Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Tom and Summer Meet Cute at the office. She is ""the new girl"", he writes greeting cards (soul of a poet?). And in portents of a love affair born in emo heaven, they bond over a mutual appreciation of Morrissey (I'm sure that the filmmakers had `em at the Smiths reference at Sundance).You math majors in the audience have probably figured out by now that the ""500 days"" refers to the length of said relationship. Screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber opt for the non-linear approach in their narrative, giving us characters who (like Kurt Vonnegut's Billy Pilgrim) appear to have become ""unstuck in time"" (day 147 might segue into day 18, which dissolves into day 310, etc.). While this device does become ""gimmicky"" rather quickly, director Webb takes full advantage of the footloose structure to inject a lot of visual playfulness. He throws in everything from Bergman references to an exuberant, fully choreographed MTV-style number (I think it's the film's best scene).Under closer scrutiny, the film isn't really much deeper than an MTV video; but it's a fun ride all the same, with enough originality and inventiveness to separate it from the pack of largely vacuous piffle that passes as ""romantic comedy"" these days (I don't sound bitter, do I?). I've only seen Gordon-Levitt in two other films (""Brick"" and ""The Lookout"") but I'm impressed by his range; I think he's got a long career ahead of him. Deschanel (America's answer to Audrey Tautou) has an effervescent screen presence that (for me, at least) makes up for the fact that she plays the same quirky, saucer-eyed Object of Desire in everything I've seen her in; but who can resist those baby blues? Like many first-time directors eager to pull out all the stops, Webb may have put too many eggs in one basket here-but I look forward to seeing what else this promising filmmaker has up his sleeve.",3,Woody Allen Lite?,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,2681,"['people', 'have', 'compared', 'director', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'Sundance', 'darling', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'obviously', 'narrative', 'inspiration', 'Allen', 'post-deconstruction', 'fizzled', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'fluffier', 'ingratiating', 'variation', 'film', 'theme', 'buoyed', 'hip', 'calculating', 'soundtrack', 'winking', 'references', 'film', 'buffs', 'charm', 'two', 'leads.At', 'beginning', 'film', 'are', 'duly', 'advised', 'mock-serious', 'tones', 'narrator', 'mellifluous', 'pipes', 'what', 'are', 'see', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'rather', 'retrospective', 'appraisal', 'relationship', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'hopelessly', 'romantic', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Tom', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'more', 'cautiously', 'pragmatic', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Summer', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Tom', 'Summer', 'Meet', 'Cute', 'office', 'new', 'girl', 'greeting', 'cards', 'soul', 'poet', 'portents', 'love', 'affair', 'born', 'emo', 'heaven', 'bond', 'mutual', 'appreciation', 'Morrissey', ""'m"", 'sure', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'em', 'Smiths', 'reference', 'Sundance', 'math', 'majors', 'audience', 'have', 'probably', 'figured', 'out', 'now', '500', 'days', 'refers', 'length', 'said', 'relationship', 'Screenwriters', 'Scott', 'Neustadter', 'Michael', 'H.', 'Weber', 'opt', 'non-linear', 'approach', 'narrative', 'giving', 'characters', 'who', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'Billy', 'Pilgrim', 'appear', 'have', 'become', 'unstuck', 'time', 'day', '147', 'might', 'segue', 'day', '18', 'day', '310', 'etc.', 'device', 'become', 'gimmicky', 'rather', 'quickly', 'director', 'Webb', 'full', 'advantage', 'footloose', 'structure', 'inject', 'lot', 'visual', 'playfulness', 'everything', 'Bergman', 'references', 'exuberant', 'fully', 'choreographed', 'MTV-style', 'number', 'think', 'film', 'best', 'scene', '.Under', 'closer', 'scrutiny', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'deeper', 'MTV', 'video', 'fun', 'ride', 'same', 'enough', 'originality', 'inventiveness', 'separate', 'pack', 'largely', 'vacuous', 'piffle', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'bitter', 'do', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'Brick', 'Lookout', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'range', 'think', 'got', 'long', 'career', 'ahead', 'Deschanel', 'America', 'answer', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'effervescent', 'screen', 'presence', 'least', 'up', 'fact', 'same', 'quirky', 'saucer-eyed', 'Object', 'Desire', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'who', 'can', 'resist', 'baby', 'blues', 'many', 'first-time', 'directors', 'eager', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'Webb', 'may', 'have', 'put', 'too', 'many', 'eggs', 'one', 'basket', 'here-but', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'else', 'promising', 'filmmaker', 'up', 'sleeve']",N/A

1241947,ABC4LIDMGUYM9,B001UV4XUG,Dorothy,"[1, 1]","""500 Days of Summer"" is not a romantic comedy. It's actually not really a love story at all, in my opinion. The film starts off with Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom Hansen, who was just dumped by the girl of his dreams and is breaking plates in his kitchen apartment. His two best friends can't get through to him, so they contact his younger sister to come and talk to him. She gets there and helps him stop breaking plates and then asks him to start from the beginning and tell her what happened between him and the girl of his dreams.Tom is a guy who apparently believes wholeheartedly about love, destiny, fate and soul mates. He grew up thinking that there is one person for everyone and never found that person until Summer(Zooey Deschanel) came into his life. Summer thinks the complete opposite about love. She doesn't believe in it, any of it. Not of fate, destiny, or soul mates either. She is a child of divorce and from a young age knew that relationships were hard and complicated. So she lives her life never getting too attached to anyone, until Tom.Tom and Summer meet at work, where they write greeting cards, and Tom falls hopelessly in love. Whereas Summer, not so much. They hang out and go out on dates and they become somewhat of a couple. For Tom, it's perfect at first, Summer throughout some of the scenes seems bored and uninterested. They have a really sweet relationship and both actors have great chemistry.Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character is sweet, charming, and naive. He is just so adorable you want everything to go his way. He's goofy and a downright nice guy. He is supposed to be this average Joe but I think he's better than average, and he also portrays a character that is completely unrealistic because there are not any guys out there like him. If there is, I never met one. Zoey Deschanel's character is simple, but for some reason in the movie they make her out to be this fantasy type girl, which yes she's gorgeous and sweet but I don't think she's everyone's ideal girl. She plays an independent, free spirited woman who doesn't like complicating things and doesn't like putting labels on her relationships. She just lives life and doesn't show any type of emotion whatsoever. She comes off rather blah. Which, again why would anyone want to date someone like that? Sure she's fun at points but mostly she just seems bored.Tom's sister, Rachel(Chloe Moretz) is easily one of my favorite characters in the film. She's ballsy and funny and she is the only one that can get through to Tom, which I really enjoy watching that kind of brother-sister relationship. His two best friends are funny too, McKenzie(Geoffrey Arend) and Paul(Matthew Gray Gubler). I wish they could've dwelled a little bit more on their friendship because their scenes were amusing and their friendship felt sincere, they weren't jerks and they didn't make fun of Tom or humiliate Tom which some movies usually like to do.The actual movie was shot beautifully. The director, Marc Webb, had some great shots. One scene that I really love is Tom going to a party and on the left side of the screen it's showing his expectations on what he wants to happen and on the right side of the screen it's showing the reality of what's actually happening. I love that scene so much, because it's so true, I know I always have expectations of certain things that happen in my life and of course they don't always reach my expectations or they are just different from my expectations all together and I thought that was just very clever. Another shot that I love is this one musical scene which exaggerates the feeling of ""love"" or well love being portrayed in movies which is truly fun to watch. There is also another nice part in the film where McKenzie gets interviewed in black and white, along with Paul and Tom all individually about love. It's a nice step outside this somewhat colorful movie and into this deep little segment of black and white reality almost.All in all, I think this is a really sweet movie. Like I said in the beginning, its not about a love story. I really think it's more a story of a guy who is just trying to find his way, or himself. Which to me, is not only intriguing but also self motivating to watch.I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys watching something completely different than anything they have ever seen before.

By way of a repeatedly time-hopping narrative, this film addresses the competing perspectives present in every long-term relationship, and how something as innocuous as a smile can be interpreted completely differently by the two people sharing it. With a ton of post-production tricks and stunts in editing, it runs the risk of being over-conceptual and spoiled, but by keeping a steady focus on that one central point that all winds up complimenting the message nicely. Zooey Deschanel plays her typical hip, quirky character (if you're not already a fan of her act, she won't convince you here) and her pairing with Joseph Gordon-Levitt feels fun and natural while it lasts.

Told in a non chronological fashion, we see 500 days in the relationship of Tom (Joseph Gordon- Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel). For those who have seen 10 Things I Hate About You, this is an evolution of that story told in a more realistic fashion. While Joseph Gordon-Levitt pretty much plays the same character, he adds gravitas to the ups and downs of relationships which all men go through at some point. Zooey Deschanel brings her playful carefree attitude to Summer, which the movie itself is quick to point out has a very strong effect over men. While most people expect this to be a love story, it's not. It's a carefully crafted story about relationships and the highs and lows we all experience and how we focus on the highs more than the lows. The quirky humor and the wittiness brought out in the film covers the very introspective dissection of a relationship. While the ending is somewhat expected, it serves as the movies last laugh.

1241951,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001UV4XUG,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","Many critics are already describing this 2009 indie romantic comedy as this generation'sAnnie Hall, but the comparison is apt only to the point where both movies surprise and delight with their persistently unpredictable approaches to well-worn themes of love gone awry over the course of a relationship. I still don't think that this film, directed by feature-film neophyte Marc Webb and scripted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Webb, achieves the emotional resonance of the earlier Woody Allen classic, probably because there have been so many attempts in the intervening three decades to copy it, but this fresh-faced film is certainly not without its moments of charm and genuine revelation about the principal characters.The time-jumping story follows the course of the rocky, five-hundred-day relationship between two LA-based twenty-somethings - Tom, an underachieving greeting-card writer who has not quite given up on his dreams to become an architect, and Summer, a recent Michigan transplant who is not looking for any long-term commitments. She is definitely the object of his growing affection, while she remains steadfastly a Holly Golightly-like fantasy figure. For a stretch, the movie feels somewhat facile and light-hearted in sketching the beginning of their courtship with the halted dialogue after a drunken karaoke night and a walk through IKEA as they pretend to be happy marrieds. The plot gets more interesting as their defining moments become jumbled from Tom's own sense of recollection, including Webb's use of film-school gimmicks like a split-screen treatment of a real-versus-imagined reunion and full-on tributes to Fellini and Bergman movies. The film's funniest bit is also the most unoriginal - a post-coital musical number set to Hall & Oates' ""You Make My Dreams"" that looks a lot like the Dr. Pepper ""Be a Pepper"" commercial from the 1970s.Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Brick) really comes into his own as Tom, providing a thoughtful depth to his portrayal of the likeable but pained protagonist. As Summer, Zooey Deschanel has the more difficult role since we don't get a view of her inner feelings the way we see Tom's. However, she uses her big blue eyes and malleable, off-kilter manner to great effect here. More importantly, she makes Tom's emotional free-fall completely understandable. Other roles are filled out more predictably - Chloe Moretz as Tom's too-wise-for-her-years younger sister Rachel, and Geoffrey Arend and Matthew Gray Gubler as his two semi-slacker buddies. Still, this movie feels a lot fresher than most of the Hollywood product out there thanks to Webb's prodigious approach. He uses the ambiguous ending to Mike Nichols'The Graduatevery well here, and there is a nice appreciation for Los Angeles architecture capped by a last scene in the legendary Bradbury Building.",4,"Fresh, Thoughtful Rom-Com Challenges One Man's Profound Faith in Love",1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,2831,"['Many', 'critics', 'are', 'already', 'describing', '2009', 'indie', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""generation'sAnnie"", 'Hall', 'comparison', 'apt', 'only', 'point', 'where', 'movies', 'surprise', 'delight', 'persistently', 'unpredictable', 'approaches', 'well-worn', 'themes', 'love', 'gone', 'awry', 'course', 'relationship', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'directed', 'feature-film', 'neophyte', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'scripted', 'Scott', 'Neustadter', 'Michael', 'H.', 'Webb', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'earlier', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'classic', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'attempts', 'intervening', 'three', 'decades', 'copy', 'fresh-faced', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'moments', 'charm', 'genuine', 'revelation', 'principal', 'characters.The', 'time-jumping', 'story', 'course', 'rocky', 'five-hundred-day', 'relationship', 'two', 'LA-based', 'twenty-somethings', 'Tom', 'underachieving', 'greeting-card', 'writer', 'who', 'not', 'quite', 'given', 'up', 'dreams', 'become', 'architect', 'Summer', 'recent', 'Michigan', 'transplant', 'who', 'not', 'looking', 'long-term', 'commitments', 'definitely', 'object', 'growing', 'affection', 'steadfastly', 'Holly', 'Golightly-like', 'fantasy', 'figure', 'stretch', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'facile', 'light-hearted', 'sketching', 'beginning', 'courtship', 'halted', 'dialogue', 'drunken', 'karaoke', 'night', 'walk', 'IKEA', 'pretend', 'be', 'happy', 'marrieds', 'plot', 'more', 'interesting', 'defining', 'moments', 'become', 'jumbled', 'Tom', 'own', 'sense', 'recollection', 'including', 'Webb', 'use', 'film-school', 'gimmicks', 'split-screen', 'treatment', 'real-versus-imagined', 'reunion', 'full-on', 'tributes', 'Fellini', 'Bergman', 'movies', 'film', 'funniest', 'bit', 'also', 'most', 'unoriginal', 'post-coital', 'musical', 'number', 'set', 'Hall', 'Oates', 'Make', 'My', 'Dreams', 'lot', 'Dr.', 'Pepper', 'Be', 'Pepper', 'commercial', '1970s.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Brick', 'really', 'own', 'Tom', 'providing', 'thoughtful', 'depth', 'portrayal', 'likeable', 'pained', 'protagonist', 'Summer', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'more', 'difficult', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'view', 'inner', 'feelings', 'way', 'see', 'Tom', 'However', 'big', 'blue', 'eyes', 'malleable', 'off-kilter', 'manner', 'great', 'effect', 'here', 'More', 'importantly', 'Tom', 'emotional', 'free-fall', 'completely', 'understandable', 'Other', 'roles', 'are', 'filled', 'out', 'more', 'predictably', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'Tom', 'too-wise-for-her-years', 'younger', 'sister', 'Rachel', 'Geoffrey', 'Arend', 'Matthew', 'Gray', 'Gubler', 'two', 'semi-slacker', 'buddies', 'Still', 'movie', 'lot', 'fresher', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'product', 'there', 'thanks', 'Webb', 'prodigious', 'approach', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'Mike', ""Nichols'The"", 'Graduatevery', 'well', 'here', 'nice', 'appreciation', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'architecture', 'capped', 'last', 'scene', 'legendary', 'Bradbury', 'Building']",N/A

Instead, in a span of 500 days, you'll see Tom Hanson (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) meet, go through the courting rituals, date, and then break up...but not in a linear timeline.  The days skip ahead and jump back at random so the audience can piece together what went right with this couple and what went wrong.During these 500 days, you'll learn about the personalities and relationship goals of each.  The movie starts out with Tom being the hopeless romantic and Summer being the cynic about love.  But as time passes, these roles begin to reverse.This is one of those quirky type of movies you'll either appreciate or you won't.  There's surreal imagery like Tom looking in the car mirror and seeing Harrison Ford, Tom having a happy day and imagining a cartoon bird landing on his shoulder, and Tom watching a black and white movie and imagining himself as the lead.  Also quirky is how one of his best friends is a preteen girl.But despite the movie's occasional wackiness, I still enjoyed this film.  There's good messages here about living your passion and having the courage to communicate in an honest way.  Towards the end of the 500 days, I thought this was going to be an anti-love movie, but just the opposite.  Tom's weakness wasn't in wanting love, but in trying to love with blinders on.

He pulls himself up by his oxford shoe laces, quits his card writing job, and becomes an architect. Summer bumps into Tom one day and invites him to a party.

It is a true indie romantic comedy.Zooey Deschanel, an actress equal parts talented and beautiful, gives her best performance to date as Summer. Her character is alluring, but frustrating to Tom, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a greeting card writer with architectural aspirations. Summer does not want a relationship; Tom does. Instead of a by the numbers ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy tries to win girl back"" plot that has been done so many times before, this film, while adhering to that formula, breaks the mold by doing it in a very creative way, no doubt due to first time feature director Marc Webb's history of making music videos. As a first time feature director, he finds a way to use a nonlinear narrative structure and never make it feel pretentious or hackneyed. There is a sequence towards the end of the film where Tom is going to see Summer at a party, and the screen is split; on one side there is Tom's expectations, and on the other is the reality of what actually happens. It is one of the better sequences I have seen in some time.For a funny and touching romantic comedy, ""(500) Days of Summer"" delivers the goods.Recommended.",4,(100) Minutes of Delight,1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,1415,"['Much', 'Juno', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'one', 'few', 'indie', 'films', 'have', 'realized', 'mainstream', 'success', 'yet', 'much', '2004', 'Garden', 'State', 'more', 'descendant', 'films', 'Graduate', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'aforementioned', 'true', 'indie', 'romantic', 'comedy.Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'actress', 'equal', 'parts', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'Summer', 'character', 'alluring', 'frustrating', 'Tom', 'played', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'greeting', 'card', 'writer', 'architectural', 'aspirations', 'Summer', 'not', 'want', 'relationship', 'Tom', 'Instead', 'numbers', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'boy', 'tries', 'win', 'girl', 'back', 'plot', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'film', 'adhering', 'formula', 'mold', 'doing', 'very', 'creative', 'way', 'doubt', 'due', 'first', 'time', 'feature', 'director', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'history', 'making', 'music', 'videos', 'first', 'time', 'feature', 'director', 'way', 'use', 'nonlinear', 'narrative', 'structure', 'never', 'make', 'feel', 'pretentious', 'hackneyed', 'sequence', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'Tom', 'going', 'see', 'Summer', 'party', 'screen', 'split', 'one', 'side', 'Tom', 'expectations', 'other', 'reality', 'what', 'actually', 'one', 'better', 'sequences', 'have', 'seen', 'time.For', 'funny', 'touching', 'romantic', 'comedy', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'goods.Recommended']",N/A

I am happy to write these two words in capital letters. Nothing is new in this world. It is impossible to come up with the new plot about love or possibility of love, or expectation of love or losing it but it is possible to look at the old story with a fresh eye and make the movie as enchanting as 500 Days of Summer.The first time director Marc Webb has started on a very high note. His movie is so charming (I know I use this word a lot but it describes 500 days perfectly). It combines many different techniques and succeeds adorably in following two leads and their 500 days of getting together and gradually drifting apart. It is rarely I see the movie which makes me smile from the beginning to the end. I felt like that big silly grin was glued to my face and I did not mind. It is nothing Webb did that I have not seen before - broken narrative,jumping back and forward in time, using the split screen technique (which makes the best scene in the film with many memorable scenes), inserting a musical number that seems to come from a Bollywood movie,changing the real world into animation. Yes, I've seen this all before but all together these tricks have mixed in something magical, delicately bitter-sweet and funny without being stupid, loud, vulgar, and pushy. The big part of the magic is with no doubt an undeniable palpable chemistry between two leads, both known for their previous performances in the independent movies. Joey Deschanel (Summer) was the best part of All the Real Girls (2003). As for Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Tom), I believe he is becoming one of the best actors of his generation. Few years ago I wrote about his performance in George Araki's Mysterious Skin, ""Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is simply the shining star of the film and I'll make sure from now on to check out all his new movies"". I am glad that I check this movie. It has generated a lot of positive reviews, and it deserves them. Time will tell but I think 500 Days of Summer may become Annie Hall for the modern time. Yes, I believe it is that good. There were few things that I did not like very much, for example a clich&eacute;d smart-alecky rather annoying character of pre-teen sister of Tom. But the entire movie is so good that I don't want to nit-pick and I recommend it highly.P.S.

1241965,A2IQGJFF7BBMJV,B001UV4XUG,Geaux Lightly,"[7, 10]","I would give it between 5/6 out of 10. The movie was very watchable, kept my interest, had a cool filming style, but I just felt meh about it. To be clear, I was not expecting a love story, particularly since they state in the beginning that it's not. So I was fine w/that aspect.First: the acting. I remember as a kid going to see JGL in ""Angels in the Outfield."" He's charming in the role of a love-sick, naive young guy. I especially got a kick out of the dancing scene. A totallyrandom scene, but it reminded me of how when we are extrahappy, we start dancing. In our rooms, in the copy room at work..sometimes we just get happy. As for Zooey D, I don't see her appeal. I don't seek out her movies, but every movie I've seen her in,she's a quirky, flakey, Mary Sue. Is it always the role or is some ofit her real self poking through? I don't know. However, it reminds me of Drew Barrymore....she just has a ditzy quality that gets tiresome when it's in every movie I see that she happens to be in. I also didn't find her to be the best-looking lady in the movie, so all of the intro in the beginning about her was a bit hollow. I thought the redhead blind date was more attractive even if she had 5 mins of screen time. This plays into the Mary Sue aspect of Summer's character.As for the story, it was clear that the movie would end up being about how he got over Summer. I was looking forward to that. However, the execution left a little to be desired. Tom definitely allowed himself to be used by Summer, however, I'm of the opinion that had she gone beyond her initial ""I don't want a relationship,"" and nipped everything completely in the bud, he would have gotten the hint. Summer had zero redeemable qualities in my eyes. She definitely used his feelings to her benefit, and if the roles were reversed, Tom would be the quintessential jerk. She was highly manipulative and she just strung him along. Something was definitely wrong with her in that she was OK using him KNOWING his feelings w/her. It was easier to identify with Tom and his ridiculous naivety bc he was emotional. We knew his motivations, but did not know hers. When I watch movies, whether I like characters or not, I feel writers should give us inclinations as to their motivation. Note: this doesn't make them likeable, it just makes them more understandable. There's absolutely no reason to act ""relationship-y"" with a person whom you KNOW wants it when you don't. After a fight where the guy/girl is upset bc he feels that you're in a relationship but you won't admit that it kinda is....only a girlfriend/boyfriend figure goes over to that person's house in the middle of the night and sleeps with them. Not a person who wishes to have boundaries. None of her behavior said ""friends."" Actually, now that I think of it, her reasons were ""because I wanted to."" Just a cold, selfish person.The part of the movie that killed it for me was when she got married and told Tom that with the new hubby ""she was sure of what she wasn't sure of w/Tom."" *Cue head scratching* So was that a throwaway ""insightful"" line or was she lying when she said she didn't want a relationship? She got married very soon after she met Tom, so w/that scene, the writers negated a lot of her personality and just made her an unlikeable character.The ending was a bit cheesy, but whatever. It's a decent movie to pass time, but you'll probably leave with the same ""meh"" feeling I did.",3,"Not horrible, but anything over 3.5 stars is a tad generous.

1241967,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001UV4XUG,Grady Harp,"[0, 1]","(500) DAYS OF SUMMER is a refreshing bit of fluff about the dance of contemporary courting - with a twist.  Writers Scott Neustader and Michael H. Weber demonstrate a keen understanding of the bumpy road of romance and have been able to make a film that balances humor and tenderness very well.  Director Marc Webb encourages his two fine lead actors to give performances that could just be career boosts for both.Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a completely different role than his usual stereotype) is an architect whose line in the job seeking market landed him in the greeting card business, writing inane messages for silly cards.  Feeling as though he will never meet the girls of his dreams, he encounters Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), a pretty if somewhat evasive and odd girl with her own concept of 'relationships'. Egged on by his friends McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) as well as his very bright 'therapist' little sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz), Tom approaches Summer in a courtship that lasts for 500 days - only some of which are rewarding.  It is a back and forth game of ping pong, with Tom the obsessed pursuer and Summer the feather in the wind.  There really is no particular linear story here, but instead a series of wonderful vignettes that allow Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel to shine as actors.  Webb interweaves drawings with photography in an especially winning way and allows the ping pong ball to bounce to and fro between periods of time in this thwarted courtship.  This is not a deep movie, but it is a well designed and acted look at love among the young today. The performances by the lead actors justify visiting this little treasure.

Fretheim,"[7, 9]","The professional critics have been all over the map on this movie, so when we ended up watching it (simply because we arrived at the wrong time to see Julie and Julia) I really did not know what to expect.  But it stars Zooey Deschanel and I have become a bit of a fan. She has fabulous talent. So we watched it.  And it was one of the best films I have seen in a long time.I think part of my reaction to this movie stems from the fact that this film is not a formula movie. As you are told upfront this is NOT a love story. It is a story about love.  We are taken back and forth over a timeline of 500 days from the moment boy meets girl to the moment when the boy finally lets go of his romantic fantasy.  But along the way we watch the two protaganists grow as people. This movie reminds us that real love actually is possible- but that it is not to be confused with romantic fantasy.  As I watched this movie unfold I realized that the negative critics were judging this film by the wrong standards- they were confusing it with a romance or a romantic comedy- when it is neither. Instead this movie reminded me of another movie: Cowboys and Angels. That movie was also NOT a formulaic love story but instead another movie ABOUT love. A movie that explores love.  We need more movies that do that- movies that we can learn from- or in which we can see ourselves, like this one.  Many of us can relate to this story all too well. But we can also relate to the ending, when it becomes clear that all the pain that the boy has been through has been both necessary and worthwhile: Because now he is ready to begin his real love story, now that he will see the woman herself, rather than just projecting his image of what he thinks he wants onto her. And that is what love is all about- not projecting an expectation and asking the other person to live up to a fantasy but rather actually wanting to be with the real person for themselves.",5,A Great Movie About Romantic Love,1250553600,"08 18, 2009",2009,1937,"['professional', 'critics', 'have', 'been', 'map', 'movie', 'so', 'when', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'simply', 'arrived', 'wrong', 'time', 'see', 'Julie', 'Julia', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'have', 'become', 'bit', 'fan', 'fabulous', 'talent', 'watched', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time.I', 'think', 'part', 'reaction', 'movie', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'formula', 'movie', 'are', 'told', 'NOT', 'love', 'story', 'story', 'love', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'forth', 'timeline', '500', 'days', 'moment', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'moment', 'when', 'boy', 'finally', 'go', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'way', 'watch', 'two', 'protaganists', 'grow', 'people', 'movie', 'real', 'love', 'actually', 'possible-', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'watched', 'movie', 'unfold', 'realized', 'negative', 'critics', 'were', 'judging', 'film', 'wrong', 'standards-', 'were', 'confusing', 'romance', 'romantic', 'comedy-', 'when', 'neither', 'Instead', 'movie', 'reminded', 'movie', 'Cowboys', 'Angels', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'NOT', 'formulaic', 'love', 'story', 'instead', 'movie', 'ABOUT', 'love', 'movie', 'love', 'need', 'more', 'movies', 'do', 'that-', 'movies', 'can', 'learn', 'from-', 'can', 'see', 'one', 'Many', 'can', 'relate', 'story', 'too', 'well', 'can', 'also', 'relate', 'ending', 'when', 'clear', 'pain', 'boy', 'been', 'been', 'necessary', 'worthwhile', 'now', 'ready', 'begin', 'real', 'love', 'story', 'now', 'will', 'see', 'woman', 'rather', 'just', 'projecting', 'image', 'what', 'what', 'love', 'about-', 'not', 'projecting', 'expectation', 'asking', 'other', 'person', 'live', 'up', 'fantasy', 'rather', 'actually', 'wanting', 'be', 'real', 'person']",N/A

I am happy to report that `(500) Days of Summer' is the former, powered by two marvelous, naturalistic performances from the leads and just enough stylized whimsy to be charming rather than grating.Tom (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) isn't completely miserable in his go-nowhere job as a copywriter at a third-rate greeting card company, but he is starting to wonder if this stop-gap job that he took when he gave up on his dream of being an architect might be where he stays stuck forever.  Then Summer (Zooey Deschanel) starts working as the boss's new assistant, making the office suddenly a whole lot more interesting as Tom and his disaffected cubicle mates speculate about the new girl.  Too shy to make a move, Tom has just decided that a girl that beautiful must be way too stuck up to ever speak to the likes of him when Summer strikes up a conversation in the elevator about the music on Tom's Ipod.  This tissue-paper thin opening leads, over the course of several months into a burgeoning office romance, at least on Tom's part.  Summer is, as she admits freely up front, a non-believer in true love due to her parents' awful divorce and is just looking for casual, uncomplicated companionship.  For a while, Tom is so thrilled just to be in her company, that seems like enough.  But it's not, really--Tom is a deep and profound romantic, (aka `the girl' in this relationship) and in Summer he is convinced he has found his ""One"".  He figures that with enough time, Summer will come around to his way of thinking: that they are a great match and belong together.  In the meantime, they give a pretty good impression of being a couple in Tom's mind, doing `coupley' things like pretend-shopping for furniture at IKEA and having sex.  For Tom the latter is a pretty profound thing that seems to seal the deal, but the free-spirited, bohemian Summer regards their encounters as just another of the `benefits' of keeping things casual.  When the inevitable day comes (somewhere in the 200s) that Summer tires of their arrangement and ends it, a devastated Tom shuffles through his pack of memories, trying to determine how he could have misread things so completely, not able to accept that he was in love all alone.Joseph Gordon-Leavitt is that rarest of commodities: a child star that has transitioned successfully into adult roles.  On ""Third Rock from the Sun"" he played an old soul trapped in the body of a young boy, and finally the rest of him has caught up with those world-weary eyes.  Joe has grown up very well, and here gets to play a character whose age mirrors his own, imbuing Tom with all the alternating moods--angst, exuberance, confidence and insecurity--that come along with first love.  As the elusive Summer, Deschanel has a trickier role; it would be very easy to hate Summer for failing to love Tom back, but we don't.  We feel the regret of something that would have been great had it worked out, but in the end, their failure to gel as a couple is nobody's fault.  Not many movies actually deserve the label `dramedy', but I'd say this is one, equal parts levity and pain, just like life itself.  Ultimately love is out there to be found, it says . . we just have to go through the `Not-the-Ones' first.  As painful as that can be, the reward at the end makes the necessary pain worthwhile.",4,Summer Stock,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,3500,"['Indie', 'features', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'sometimes', 'delightful', 'fresh', 'surprising', 'just', 'often', 'pretentious', 'boring', 'self-conscious', 'film', 'school', 'projects', 'masquerading', 'Important', 'Cinema', 'am', 'happy', 'report', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'former', 'powered', 'two', 'marvelous', 'naturalistic', 'performances', 'leads', 'just', 'enough', 'stylized', 'whimsy', 'be', 'charming', 'rather', 'grating.Tom', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Leavitt', ""n't"", 'completely', 'miserable', 'go-nowhere', 'job', 'copywriter', 'third-rate', 'greeting', 'card', 'company', 'starting', 'wonder', 'stop-gap', 'job', 'took', 'when', 'gave', 'up', 'dream', 'being', 'architect', 'might', 'be', 'where', 'stuck', 'forever', 'Then', 'Summer', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'working', 'boss', 'new', 'assistant', 'making', 'office', 'suddenly', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'Tom', 'disaffected', 'cubicle', 'mates', 'speculate', 'new', 'girl', 'Too', 'shy', 'make', 'move', 'Tom', 'just', 'decided', 'girl', 'beautiful', 'must', 'be', 'way', 'too', 'stuck', 'up', 'ever', 'speak', 'likes', 'when', 'Summer', 'up', 'conversation', 'elevator', 'music', 'Tom', 'Ipod', 'tissue-paper', 'thin', 'opening', 'leads', 'course', 'several', 'months', 'burgeoning', 'office', 'romance', 'least', 'Tom', 'part', 'Summer', 'freely', 'up', 'front', 'non-believer', 'true', 'love', 'due', 'parents', 'awful', 'divorce', 'just', 'looking', 'casual', 'uncomplicated', 'companionship', 'while', 'Tom', 'so', 'thrilled', 'just', 'be', 'company', 'enough', 'not', 'really', 'Tom', 'deep', 'profound', 'romantic', 'aka', 'girl', 'relationship', 'Summer', 'convinced', 'found', 'One', 'enough', 'time', 'Summer', 'will', 'come', 'way', 'thinking', 'are', 'great', 'match', 'belong', 'together', 'meantime', 'give', 'pretty', 'good', 'impression', 'being', 'couple', 'Tom', 'mind', 'doing', 'coupley', 'things', 'pretend-shopping', 'furniture', 'IKEA', 'having', 'sex', 'Tom', 'latter', 'pretty', 'profound', 'thing', 'seal', 'deal', 'free-spirited', 'bohemian', 'Summer', 'regards', 'encounters', 'just', 'benefits', 'keeping', 'things', 'casual', 'When', 'inevitable', 'day', 'somewhere', '200s', 'Summer', 'tires', 'arrangement', 'devastated', 'Tom', 'shuffles', 'pack', 'memories', 'trying', 'determine', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'misread', 'things', 'so', 'completely', 'not', 'able', 'accept', 'was', 'love', 'alone.Joseph', 'Gordon-Leavitt', 'rarest', 'commodities', 'child', 'star', 'transitioned', 'successfully', 'adult', 'roles', 'Third', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'played', 'old', 'soul', 'trapped', 'body', 'young', 'boy', 'finally', 'rest', 'caught', 'up', 'world-weary', 'eyes', 'Joe', 'grown', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'play', 'character', 'age', 'own', 'imbuing', 'Tom', 'alternating', 'moods', 'angst', 'exuberance', 'confidence', 'insecurity', 'come', 'first', 'love', 'elusive', 'Summer', 'Deschanel', 'trickier', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'easy', 'hate', 'Summer', 'failing', 'love', 'Tom', 'back', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'regret', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'had', 'worked', 'out', 'end', 'failure', 'gel', 'couple', 'nobody', 'fault', 'Not', 'many', 'movies', 'actually', 'deserve', 'label', 'dramedy', ""'d"", 'say', 'one', 'equal', 'parts', 'levity', 'pain', 'just', 'life', 'Ultimately', 'love', 'out', 'there', 'be', 'found', 'just', 'have', 'go', 'Not-the-Ones', 'first', 'As', 'painful', 'can', 'be', 'reward', 'end', 'necessary', 'pain', 'worthwhile']",N/A

1241979,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B001UV4XUG,Irfan A. Alvi,"[3, 4]","This movie portrays a romantic relationship (but ""not a love story"") between a couple which appears to be in their twenties.  The girl is named Summer and the relationship spans 500 days, hence the title.  The guy falls in love but the girl seems to be in it mainly for fun, though he seems justified in believing that the relationship could be and should be more than that.  As a result of these differing perceptions, we see the relationship gradually deteriorate, though the movie concludes with the unexpected possibility of a happy ending.But we don't see this deterioration unfold linearly, because the movie instead uses the device of presenting the story by jumping around among the 500 days, always indicating which day we're seeing.  The upside of this device is that we're able to clearly see the contrast between earlier and later stages of the relationship, but the downside is that this jumping around creates extra work for the viewer and I'm not sure it's always worth the bother.As I was watching the movie, I felt somewhat annoyed because the girl seemed to be giving implausibly mixed signals and being implausibly self-indulgent at the expense of the guy.  But at the very end of the movie, it dawned on me that the real reason I felt annoyed was that I personally experienced a miniature version of this story many years ago (it actually lasted for exactly one summer), so this movie was hitting close to home at a subconscious level.  So I have to admit that the plot is indeed plausible, though I still can't say that the story was enjoyable to watch, and I can't see why anyone else would enjoy it either.If the story isn't enjoyable, does it at least teach us something?  Perhaps.  One possibility is that if both people in a relationship aren't fully on board with it (after having openly discussed the issue), the relationship should be abandoned.  As the song says, ""it takes two to make a thing go right; it takes two to make it outa sight.""  Another question the movie raises towards the end is whether the twists and turns of relationships happen according to a larger plan, or whether it's largely a matter of chance.

1241984,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001UV4XUG,Jason,"[1, 3]","At times funny, at others trying too hard to be quirky - unsurprisingly, the cute but odd Zooey Deschanel stars - 500 Days of Summer takes a very long time to tell viewers what most know already: being in love is great, but being dumped is horrendous.  Love makes you skip down the street, imaginary marching band in tow, hi-fiving strangers as animated bluejays playfully tug at loose cowlicks.  Conversely, a lover scorned is a pitiful mess, incapable of rational thought or behavior, realizing egregious faults previously tolerated (like her enormous behind).  Making it worse is the habit of former lovers - primarily women - wishing to be friends after carving out hears with evil, scaly, soulless talons.Tom (Levitt) believes in love at first site, and when he meets Summer (Deschanel) his beliefs are confirmed.  While Tom is the typical person actively living a normal life, searching for love, Summer is an enigmatic free-spirit who readily admits that all she loves is the careless ability with which she can cut off her hair.  Naturally, the two become a couple, and Tom becomes much more emotionally involved than Summer.I appreciated the bold manner in which the cinematography was approached.  In more than one instance, unique styles were effectively used to convey a point or drive home a feeling.  The back-and-forth manner of storytelling, while normally forced and unnecessary, doesn't detract from the story much; in fact, it adds a dimension at times facilitates the tying of loose ends.  With an opening line of, ""You should be warned, this is not a love story,"" I'd say the film hits close to how real relationships and breakups occur - blindsided by a semi - and avoids the implausible formulaic traps in which most rom-coms get inextricably trapped.  The major problem with this film is that there are no repercussions for Summer's cold actions.  No lessons learned.  Tom may reap the benefits of being crushed, but there is no revelation for the female lead.  Not even Tom getting angry at her flippant behavior.  Somehow I doubt the same would hold true if the sexes were reversed.Nothing new here.

1241985,A106016KSI0YQ,B001UV4XUG,Jay Dickson,"[1, 2]","Marc Webb's indie twenty-something romantic comedy takes place in a Los Angeles that conforms pretty much as to how its hero, Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is himself: clean, hip, and retro. The film's narration sets us up to believe the film will be pretty much equally about how Tom, a greeting-card writer who once dreamed of being an architect, and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), his boss's assistant and the girl of his dreams, will see their ensuing relationship, although the reality is that the movie is mostly from Tom's perspective and Summer exists mostly as a commitment-phobic enigma to break his heart. (Her two-dimensionality is signaled by the film's cringe-worthy title pun.) The film, as has been noted elsewhere, is less original than it purports to be, although its playful time scheme (it zips back and forth from different points in their relationship--from infatuation to early love to disillusionment) is one of the most interesting things in the movie; among the least are derivative fantasy sequences where Tom sings his love with a crowd in a park (with a cartoon bird) and sees his relationship as a Bergman film. The best thing the film has going for it is Gordon-Levitt, whose animated eyebrows and cartoon squiggle of a mouth are marvelously expressive: he deserves a better film. The film seems to be a kind of advertisement for IKEA (there are multiple scenes set in the Los Angeles store) and for color-coding your wardrobe: Gordon-Levitt keeps to browns and blacks (with early 1980s skinny ties and cardigans), while Deschanel affects deep blues. How either of them affords their spectacularly expensive wardrobes, or their beautifully appointed one-bedroom private apartments in downtown Los Angeles, is something the filmmakers never explain.",3,Best Dressed,1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,1772,"['Marc', 'Webb', 'indie', 'twenty-something', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'place', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'hero', 'Tom', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'clean', 'hip', 'retro', 'film', 'narration', 'sets', 'believe', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'equally', 'how', 'Tom', 'greeting-card', 'writer', 'who', 'once', 'dreamed', 'being', 'architect', 'Summer', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'boss', 'assistant', 'girl', 'dreams', 'will', 'see', 'ensuing', 'relationship', 'reality', 'movie', 'mostly', 'Tom', 'perspective', 'Summer', 'mostly', 'commitment-phobic', 'enigma', 'break', 'heart', 'two-dimensionality', 'signaled', 'film', 'cringe-worthy', 'title', 'pun', 'film', 'been', 'noted', 'elsewhere', 'less', 'original', 'be', 'playful', 'time', 'scheme', 'back', 'forth', 'different', 'points', 'relationship', 'infatuation', 'early', 'love', 'disillusionment', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'things', 'movie', 'least', 'are', 'derivative', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'where', 'Tom', 'love', 'crowd', 'park', 'cartoon', 'bird', 'relationship', 'Bergman', 'film', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'going', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'animated', 'eyebrows', 'cartoon', 'squiggle', 'mouth', 'are', 'marvelously', 'expressive', 'better', 'film', 'film', 'be', 'kind', 'advertisement', 'IKEA', 'are', 'multiple', 'scenes', 'set', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'store', 'color-coding', 'wardrobe', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'keeps', 'browns', 'blacks', 'early', '1980s', 'skinny', 'ties', 'cardigans', 'Deschanel', 'deep', 'blues', 'How', 'affords', 'spectacularly', 'expensive', 'wardrobes', 'beautifully', 'appointed', 'one-bedroom', 'private', 'apartments', 'downtown', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'something', 'filmmakers', 'never', 'explain']",N/A

1241992,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001UV4XUG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 2]","(500) Days of Summer was one of the most acclaimed films of 2009, almost unanimously adored by filmgoers and critics alike. It's a romantic-comedy, one of the more repetitive genres of recent years...Yet, unlike many of the bigger-budget romantic-comedies, it actually succeeds at blending both romanticism and comedy together to create a smart, cute, and funny film. It also helps that (500) Days of Summer is not a love story, but a story about a broken relationship that wasn't your typical movie-like relationship in the first place.The opening title card initially appears to be a disclaimer, but ends up being the film's first joke and it's actually funny. An uncredited narrator introduces us to Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), both completely different people. Tom is an idealistic, effusive romantic and lover of British pop music. Summer is a reserved, emotionally detached woman with significantly less ideals of love and things of that nature. The story jumps back and forth between the 500 days that Tom met Summer, fell in love with her, attempted to win her over, almost did, lost her, and then attempted to come to grips with that loss.In the hands of lesser writers, the chronology of the film would have seemed like a gimmick but this sort of chronology really serves the story best. Roger Ebert said that it worked because we don't remember relationships in chronological order and no one has summed it up better. There doesn't seem to be any structure, as we'll see a day where Tom is completely heartbroken over Summer and then a scene where they're together and OK. There is structure here however and it works flawlessly, as we seem to actually be watching someone recount the details of a relationship.Director Marc Webb, who previously directed music videos and make his feature-film debut here, handles this material remarkably well and only has one scene that sort of shows his credentials as a previous music video director. This scene, which has a choreographed dance sequence, happens at random but serves the spontaneity of the story, as well as showing how much joy was put into making this.And, as I said, the humor here is actually funny. It uses the cynicism that would come with a failed relationship rather than go for cheap jokes and there's never a moment where the humor seems forced. While many have written about Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel (performance-wise), I feel credit is due to Geoffrey Arend as McKenzie, Tom's friend, as well. Arend provides many of the biggest laughs in the movie and is rarely mentioned in reviews. Gordon-Levitt is quickly becoming one of today's finest actors and after seeing him tackle dark, violent roles recently it's amazing how easily his charm shines through as Tom. Deschanel, both beautiful and charming in her own unique way, is the perfect summer. She's previously used her monotonous, indifferent qualities as tools for humor but here she uses it to illustrate the coldness of Summer. It's easy to see how Tom could feel unrequited longing for this girl.Being both a huge fan of The Smiths (whose music plays a relatively large role in the film overall) and finding Zooey Deschanel to be both talented and gorgeous, I was sort of inclined to love this movie. After all, the scene between Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel in the elevator is like a scene from my dreams. But, bias aside, (500) Days of Summer is a wonderful romantic-comedy. With the exception of the sappy and predictable, yet sweet, ending; the film avoids the typical clich&eacute;s that come along with this genre. This is a work of true originality that is both witty and incredibly charming.

Because once you trudge through all the brainless, repetitive nonsense, there is the slight chance you might stumble across something truly rewarding. This is where (500) Days of Summer comes in. Sure, the film may be a few years old, but it&#8217;s one that has been on my radar for quite some time. Unfortunately, it found itself buried beneath everything else, and I was unable to watch it until recently. Exceeding any and all expectations I may have previously harbored, (500) Days of Summer was a joy in almost every regard. &#8220;This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know up front, this is not a love story.&#8221;(500) Days follows the story of Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young greeting card writer with a strong passion for architecture. Beyond being unsatisfied with how his life has turned out thus far, Tom is also a hopeless romantic in search of &#8220;the one.&#8221; After meeting his boss Vance&#8217;s (Clark Gregg) new assistant, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), Tom falls head-over-heals with the notion that she is his soul mate. Unfortunately, Summer isn&#8217;t a believer of putting labels on relationships, which results in Tom&#8217;s life becoming hectic and confusing. As the film progresses, the audience views the rise and fall of their relationship, but the narrative is presented in a rather unusual way.For starters, instead of following the relationship in the usual linear fashion, the film is set-up so that the audience is constantly jumping around different sections of the timeline. Although it was a bit awkward at first, there is no denying it payed off in the end. What this formula essentially did was allow the filmmakers to show the sharp contrast between the beginning of the relationship and how it differed from, say, 200 days later. The first trip to Ikea showed two individuals with an undeniable chemistry, whereas a second trip showed a relationship where one party was resentful of the other. Playing these segments back to back was not only creative, but also extremely satisfying as well.Another unique aspect of the film is that the writers tell you from the start that the relationship is going to fail. So as the audience watches Tom constantly struggle and go out of his way to try and impress this woman, they know he&#8217;s wasting his time. They know that he&#8217;s going to be left a hurt, damaged, and fragmented version of his old self. It&#8217;s an extremely dark, and risky, method of storytelling, but (500) Days nails it gracefully. Had the story been presented in a more traditional fashion, Tom&#8217;s melancholic state would have felt overwhelming and depressing. Instead, it becomes a healthy state of affairs because we quickly see how it fueled his desire to continue through life and make the changes necessary to truly be happy.In addition, even with all these unique aspects, (500) Days still managed to keep a consistent flow throughout the film&#8217;s 95 minutes. There is a certain confident energy that really propels the story line, and part of this is due to the acting from the two leads&#8212;Goron-Levitt and Deschanel. Apart from giving strong performances individually, there is an obvious chemistry between the two, which helps make their relationship feel more three-dimensional. Unfortunately, I did feel like Summer could have used some more attention. Although we hear her tell Tom she doesn&#8217;t want a relationship, her sudden dislike toward him as a person was never explained. As a result, she was left feeling a little underdeveloped.Finally, the music present in (500) Days is beautiful by every definition of the word. For starters, the score&#8212;composed by Mychael Danna and Rob Simonsen&#8212;is both understated and extremely charming. It manages to make itself known even when it&#8217;s surrounded by one the strongest soundtracks I&#8217;ve heard in years. Consisting of music from The Smiths, Wolfmother, and Simon & Garfunkel, among others, the (500) Days soundtrack is fresh and unbelievably fitting. Beyond acquiring a great collection of songs, the way the filmmakers incorporated the music into the film was phenomenal. For example, the inclusion of &#8220;Hero&#8221; by Regina Spektor managed to turn an average scene into something that was both heartbreaking and gut-wrenching.Overall Score: 9/10 - It&#8217;s very rare that I give out a nine or higher, but (500) Days of Summer earned it. While the story itself may not be terribly unique, it&#8217;s the way it is told that makes this film standout from your every day RomCom. In addition, the film is accompanied by some great performances from its leads as well as some fantastic music, which makes this indie flick a must watch.",5,9/10 - Marvelous,1384732800,"11 18,

1241994,AABGV02YMQ2OZ,B001UV4XUG,"J. Ryan ""JRyan""","[3, 12]","Here's the basic premise for your typical Hollywood romantic-comedy:1.) Boy meets girl2.) We see how different boy and girl are and how much they hate each other (OMG no way they end up together!)3.) Boy & girl have lighthearted/flirtatious moment, then quickly pretend like nothing happened (""Uh, I should  go..."")4.) Boy/girl talks to quirky best friend about maybe-sort of-kinda liking said boy or girl (""I think I kinda like (name)"")5.) Quirky best friend gives incredibly insightful advice on romance/relationships and tells them what to do6.) Boy/girl confesses their love to the other7.) Boy/girl says how it will never work (""We're just too different!"")8.) Boy/girl runs outside into rain, boy/girl runs out to catch them9.) Boy and girl argue again for short time, then quickly stop and share passionate kiss10.) Flash to 1 year later at their wedding11.) (Cue current top-40 pop song)12.) The End...okay, maybe not all Hollywood rom-coms have this exact formula, but 90% of the one that have come out recently are so formulaic and predictable it' almost laughable. It seems like all you need to make a romantic comedy nowadays are two good looking B-list celebs and half decent script with a couple of decent jokes. This is why I left the theatre confused and conflicted in my opinion of (500) Days of Summer. There were moments in the film of sheer brilliance and originality, and others that seemed completely tacky and recycled.The film follows Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) on a desperate chase for love with a girl named Summer (Zooey Deschanel). The only problem is that she doesn't believe in love, let alone the boyfriend/girlfriend label. The advertising for this film preached about how this was not a love story, but a story about love, which is true, and is one of things that I liked about this film. Not all the people we think we love and seem perfect for us are perfect for us. The film deconstructs this and examines why we fall in love with who we do, what we're really chasing after and why relationships sometimes fail.The film jumps around through the 500 days he spends with Summer and shows us the moments of pure joy and contentment that being in love can give you, as well as the moments of shear frustration and uncertainty that come with it.  For the most part, it is done in an honest and heartfelt way. An example of this is an incredibly clever scene towards the middle of the film where we see a split screen of Tom going to meet Summer for a party at her house. One side shows expectation and the other side shows what really happens. It is a completely original, honest and somewhat tender scene that does a great job of showing how Tom is really chasing after the idea of love, not Summer, herself. He is in love with the idea of the cute and quirky girl who likes the same little things he does. To put it how Woody Allen did in Manhattan, he romanticizes it.One thing you usually don't see in these romance films is showing it from the male's perspective. The point of this is to make us empathize with the male character, Tom, and be frustrated and annoyed with the female character, Summer. While there were times I could relate to Tom and see why he would be mad at Summer, I couldn't help but just be incredibly annoyed with him the rest of the time. When it comes to dealing with her, he is selfish, annoying and gets upset over the littlest things. The only way he can realize how childish and stupid he is being is during the ridiculously cheesy scenes with his quirky and intellectual (see above) kid sister who tells him that he is obsessing over Summer because she just likes the same stupid little things that he does (also, did anyone notice the elevator scene where he finds out she likes The Smiths was a complete rip-off of Garden State?). He is in love with what she is, not with who she is, and this ultimately proves to be the downfall of their relationship.It has clich&eacute; scenes that will make you roll your eyes and genuinely charming ones where you can't help but smile. Despite any of its faults, where the film succeeds is in its believable, albeit occasionally annoying characters, witty script, and its off-beat take on relationships and love. It shows how we can't go out searching for our perfect match because love is so spontaneous and unpredictable--most of the times you just stumble upon them.-Jeffrey Ryan[...][...]",3,A cut above the typical Hollywood rom-com,1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,4404,"['Here', 'basic', 'premise', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'romantic-comedy:1', 'Boy', 'girl2', 'see', 'how', 'different', 'boy', 'girl', 'are', 'how', 'much', 'hate', 'other', 'OMG', 'way', 'end', 'up', 'together', '3', 'Boy', 'girl', 'have', 'lighthearted/flirtatious', 'moment', 'then', 'quickly', 'pretend', 'nothing', 'happened', 'Uh', 'should', 'go', '4', 'Boy/girl', 'talks', 'quirky', 'best', 'friend', 'maybe-sort', 'of-kinda', 'liking', 'said', 'boy', 'girl', 'think', 'kinda', 'name', '5', 'Quirky', 'best', 'friend', 'incredibly', 'insightful', 'advice', 'romance/relationships', 'what', 'do6', 'Boy/girl', 'love', 'other7', 'Boy/girl', 'how', 'will', 'never', 'work', ""'re"", 'just', 'too', 'different', '8', 'Boy/girl', 'rain', 'boy/girl', 'out', 'catch', 'them9', 'Boy', 'girl', 'argue', 'again', 'short', 'time', 'then', 'quickly', 'stop', 'share', 'passionate', 'kiss10', 'Flash', '1', 'year', 'later', 'wedding11', 'Cue', 'current', 'top-40', 'pop', 'song', '12', 'End', 'okay', 'maybe', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'rom-coms', 'have', 'exact', 'formula', '90', '%', 'one', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'recently', 'are', 'so', 'formulaic', 'predictable', 'almost', 'laughable', 'need', 'make', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'nowadays', 'are', 'two', 'good', 'looking', 'B-list', 'celebs', 'half', 'decent', 'script', 'couple', 'decent', 'jokes', 'why', 'left', 'theatre', 'confused', 'conflicted', 'opinion', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'were', 'moments', 'film', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'originality', 'others', 'seemed', 'completely', 'tacky', 'recycled.The', 'film', 'Tom', 'Hansen', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'desperate', 'chase', 'love', 'girl', 'named', 'Summer', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'only', 'problem', ""n't"", 'believe', 'love', 'let', 'alone', 'boyfriend/girlfriend', 'label', 'advertising', 'film', 'preached', 'how', 'was', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'story', 'love', 'true', 'one', 'things', 'liked', 'film', 'Not', 'people', 'think', 'love', 'seem', 'perfect', 'are', 'perfect', 'film', 'why', 'fall', 'love', 'who', 'do', 'what', ""'re"", 'really', 'chasing', 'why', 'relationships', 'sometimes', 'fail.The', 'film', 'jumps', '500', 'days', 'Summer', 'moments', 'pure', 'joy', 'contentment', 'being', 'love', 'can', 'give', 'as', 'well', 'moments', 'shear', 'frustration', 'uncertainty', 'most', 'part', 'done', 'honest', 'heartfelt', 'way', 'example', 'incredibly', 'clever', 'scene', 'middle', 'film', 'where', 'see', 'split', 'screen', 'Tom', 'going', 'meet', 'Summer', 'party', 'house', 'One', 'side', 'expectation', 'other', 'side', 'what', 'really', 'completely', 'original', 'honest', 'somewhat', 'tender', 'scene', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'Tom', 'really', 'chasing', 'idea', 'love', 'not', 'Summer', 'herself', 'love', 'idea', 'cute', 'quirky', 'girl', 'who', 'same', 'little', 'things', 'put', 'how', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'did', 'Manhattan', 'it.One', 'thing', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'romance', 'films', 'showing', 'male', 'perspective', 'point', 'make', 'empathize', 'male', 'character', 'Tom', 'be', 'frustrated', 'annoyed', 'female', 'character', 'Summer', 'were', 'times', 'could', 'relate', 'Tom', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'mad', 'Summer', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'just', 'be', 'incredibly', 'annoyed', 'rest', 'time', 'When', 'dealing', 'selfish', 'annoying', 'upset', 'littlest', 'things', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'realize', 'how', 'childish', 'stupid', 'being', 'ridiculously', 'cheesy', 'scenes', 'quirky', 'intellectual', 'see', 'kid', 'sister', 'who', 'obsessing', 'Summer', 'just', 'same', 'stupid', 'little', 'things', 'also', 'did', 'anyone', 'notice', 'elevator', 'scene', 'where', 'out', 'Smiths', 'was', 'complete', 'rip-off', 'Garden', 'State', 'love', 'what', 'not', 'who', 'ultimately', 'be', 'downfall', 'relationship.It', 'clich', 'eacute', 'scenes', 'will', 'make', 'roll', 'eyes', 'genuinely', 'charming', 'ones', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'faults', 'where', 'film', 'believable', 'occasionally', 'annoying', 'characters', 'witty', 'script', 'off-beat', 'take', 'relationships', 'love', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'searching', 'perfect', 'match', 'love', 'so', 'spontaneous', 'unpredictable', 'most', 'times', 'just', 'stumble', 'them.-Jeffrey', 'Ryan', '[', ']', '[', ']']",N/A

There's a dance scene of Gordon-Levitt's that's just priceless; Zooey sings and--as always--my heart melts.I like this movie, don't get me wrong, but I don't LOVE this movie, and it's not because it's not the ending the audience typically wants. Minka Kelly is no booby prize; I'd quickly embrace her if scorned by Deschanel, and go on to live a long and happy lifestyle of frolicking through IKEA stores.  It's hard to point out the gap between me liking this movie and me loving it, and in the end comes down to individual interpretations of aesthetic qualities.But it's a hilarious movie--at times I knew the witticisms couldn't be more spot on; it's an emotional movie--at times the romance is so potent my eyes water.

1241998,A2ARM6AHTM0QGF,B001UV4XUG,karenina delta,"[6, 6]","When you see Romantic Comedy (rom-com) movies in Hollywood, it is so cliche, so predictable, so feel-good. It's like there's this formula that boy meets girl, feels good (or sometimes bad) then eventually, because of a significant episode (be stranded somewhere, go to one of their hometowns, there's a big project at work, etc. etc.), they will soon fall in love... and we all know the rest.500 Days didn't jump into that bandwagon. In fact, it defied the norms of Romantic Comedies. Usually, it is the guy who doesn't believe in love and 'plays the field' and girls are the common usual hopeless romantics. But not in this flick. It's the guy who is trying to find ""The One"" and whose heart was broken, who moves on from this heartache. The forward-replay sequence of the days may be weird and confusing to some but this makes it very unique. It shows the contrast of Summer's before and after effect on Tom's life. And I don't think it will be just as striking if it went from Day 1 to Day 500. For me, the ending is very, very promising. Like it would stay in your mind even after the credits are rolling. It's like the ending is also something else's beginning. And the fact that it ended there leaves so many things in the viewers' imagination.The movie had so many fun moments, I could almost relate to my own experiences (although not exactly the same, just as funny as  a memory)- like that game when they were shouting the male organ in a park, the 'morning after' dancing on the park, the guessing of songs by humming it over the phone, the husband-and-wife role playing in the mall. And just as many sad moments like the reality/expectations scene, the last conversation at the 'favorite spot'. I just wasn't showing, but tears were already welling.I also need to commend the witty script, the convincing cast (I really think Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of Hollywood's most underrated actors) and this movie's ability to make you smile through tears.

1242004,A2T049UQONS0OY,B001UV4XUG,Larry VanDeSande,"[2, 2]","""Days of Summer"" is a splendid 2009 love story about a pair of young adults in a large city (pegged at 3.8 million at one point in the film) who meet at work, develop love for each other, and pursue that. The story is told in the 500 days it takes for the male, Tom, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who was so excellent as a confused fall guy inThe Lookout, to completely go through the affair and come out the other side intact. The female lead, Summer, is played by Zooey Deschanel (Tin Man,All the Real Girls,Flakes). The pair performed together previously in 2001'sManic.While the two leads are sterling, three-dimensional and consistenlty credible in their roles as star-crossed lovers, it is not their acting that best carries the argument. That is the production-script method, borrowed from the now-famous technique perfected inPulp Fictionwhere the story is told in both current time and through the past, interchanged by scene to give you a multidisciplinary look at the characters and what they encountered during their time together through each other, their friends and confidantes, and elsewhere.For me, the most telling aspect of the film is the way it evokes memories of the pair's affair, from its earliest day to its end, and the emotions the pair lived through while this was transpiring. The 500 days of emotional travelogue are told with kindness and sensitivity as the pair displays all the wonder, joy and discovery of young love, followed by the questioning, uncertainty and insecurity that follows as the passion subsides (for one partner) and doubt more and more creeps in. Tom, in particular, effectively portrays the nihilism that can result from an unsatisfying end of such events, not to mention his personal conflict of failing to have expectation match reality once the love issue is decided.But don't be dismayed for this film is not a downer; far from it, in fact. It is a romantic comedy wrapped in today's clothes, music and industries. These are a pair of young adults finding their way in the world; one was supposed to be an architect but became a slogan writer for a greeting card company. The other was an English major spending time as an assistant at the greeting card company. Neither knows quite whom he or she is and their love collaboration is, in part, doomed by this lack of certainty.As much as this is a story about humor, relationships, love and heartbreak, it is also a story about transitions, growing up, becoming an adult and learning to understand the randomness that is inherent in life. It is also symbolic in other ways; the title, Days of Summer, is both literal and metaphoric. I didn't understand this until some hours after the film, when I put together what happened at the end with the rest of the movie. While many good films die at the end, when the producers, script writer and director don't know how to conclude matters, this film is at is very best at the final moments -- day 500. The ending is full of the same joy, discovery and curiosity that characterized the first 300 or so days of summer. I laughed out loud at the final scene when the film ended, one of the few times I can recall that happening in more than a half-century watching movies.To summarize, this is a wonderful contemporary romantic comedy full of great things -- effective acting, nice location shooting, fine production values, as much reality as fantasy as can be had in a love story, and enough intellectual content that you won't disparage the movie for not making its points during its span in your home. If you like contemporary urban films and/or romance, you will almost certainly enjoy Days of Summer.",4,"A traversal of young love, growth, insecurity and reconciliation",1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,3655,"['Days', 'Summer', 'splendid', '2009', 'story', 'pair', 'young', 'adults', 'large', 'city', 'pegged', '3.8', 'million', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'who', 'meet', 'work', 'develop', 'love', 'other', 'pursue', 'story', 'told', '500', 'days', 'male', 'Tom', 'played', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'excellent', 'confused', 'fall', 'guy', 'inThe', 'Lookout', 'completely', 'go', 'affair', 'come', 'out', 'other', 'side', 'intact', 'female', 'lead', 'Summer', 'played', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Tin', 'Man', 'Real', 'Girls', 'Flakes', 'pair', 'performed', 'together', 'previously', ""2001'sManic.While"", 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'sterling', 'three-dimensional', 'consistenlty', 'credible', 'roles', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'not', 'acting', 'best', 'argument', 'production-script', 'method', 'borrowed', 'now-famous', 'technique', 'perfected', 'inPulp', 'Fictionwhere', 'story', 'told', 'current', 'time', 'past', 'interchanged', 'scene', 'give', 'multidisciplinary', 'look', 'characters', 'what', 'encountered', 'time', 'together', 'other', 'friends', 'confidantes', 'elsewhere.For', 'most', 'telling', 'aspect', 'film', 'way', 'memories', 'pair', 'affair', 'earliest', 'day', 'end', 'emotions', 'pair', 'lived', 'was', 'transpiring', '500', 'days', 'emotional', 'travelogue', 'are', 'told', 'kindness', 'sensitivity', 'pair', 'wonder', 'joy', 'discovery', 'young', 'love', 'followed', 'questioning', 'uncertainty', 'insecurity', 'passion', 'subsides', 'one', 'partner', 'doubt', 'more', 'more', 'creeps', 'Tom', 'particular', 'effectively', 'nihilism', 'can', 'result', 'unsatisfying', 'end', 'such', 'events', 'not', 'mention', 'personal', 'conflict', 'failing', 'have', 'expectation', 'match', 'reality', 'love', 'issue', 'decided.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'dismayed', 'film', 'not', 'downer', 'far', 'fact', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'wrapped', 'today', 'clothes', 'music', 'industries', 'are', 'pair', 'young', 'adults', 'finding', 'way', 'world', 'one', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'architect', 'became', 'slogan', 'writer', 'greeting', 'card', 'company', 'other', 'was', 'English', 'major', 'spending', 'time', 'assistant', 'greeting', 'card', 'company', 'quite', 'whom', 'love', 'collaboration', 'part', 'doomed', 'lack', 'certainty.As', 'much', 'story', 'humor', 'relationships', 'love', 'heartbreak', 'also', 'story', 'transitions', 'growing', 'up', 'becoming', 'adult', 'learning', 'understand', 'randomness', 'inherent', 'life', 'also', 'symbolic', 'other', 'ways', 'title', 'Days', 'Summer', 'literal', 'metaphoric', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'hours', 'film', 'when', 'put', 'together', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'rest', 'movie', 'many', 'good', 'films', 'die', 'end', 'when', 'producers', 'script', 'writer', 'director', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'conclude', 'matters', 'film', 'very', 'best', 'final', 'moments', 'day', '500', 'ending', 'full', 'same', 'joy', 'discovery', 'curiosity', 'characterized', 'first', '300', 'so', 'days', 'summer', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'can', 'recall', 'happening', 'more', 'half-century', 'watching', 'movies.To', 'summarize', 'wonderful', 'contemporary', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'full', 'great', 'things', 'effective', 'acting', 'nice', 'location', 'shooting', 'fine', 'production', 'values', 'much', 'reality', 'as', 'fantasy', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'love', 'story', 'enough', 'intellectual', 'content', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disparage', 'movie', 'not', 'making', 'points', 'span', 'home', 'like', 'contemporary', 'urban', 'films', 'and/or', 'romance', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'Days', 'Summer']",N/A

This summer his bid to get closer to a major breakthrough in feature films, he delivers a wonderful performance in the poetic gem that is ""500 Days of Summer"".Mr. Gordon-Levitt often approaches his roles with a wink and a nod demonstrating that he truly loves his craft. He is joined by a great supporting cast including the equally charming Zooey Duchanel. In a refreshing take on young love, the script has some fun like when he and Zooey finally consummate their budding relationship.He is a very empathetic actor and one almost bristles at how casual Zooey's character is towards the entire budding, office romance. The movie perfectly captures so much of what is memorable about falling in love and what is as stifling as the lost of that love. Told from a male point of view, Zooey's character takes on the more traditional masculine characteristics like acting non-commital even after lines have been crossed into deeper parts of a relationship.Mr. Gordon-Levitt also possesses a more than adequate singing voice that indicates yet another aspect of his talent. When he belts out at a office karaoke party, you are more than entertained. He is clearly set up for a big breakthrough in movies.

Nothing from the film really stood out to me except for the penis game and Thomas's friend McKenzie, who sang out at the bar ""... and I'm proud to be an American!"" I always burst out singing that song at random...while sober. I feel like Joseph Gordon-Levitt  is starting to get type casted because he was in a similar film called, 10 Things I Hate About You, which was a great film by the way, much better than this one. Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) is really just another girl. Time and time again there will always be those pathetic guys who fall for these witty, quiet girls with no real personality. So honestly I am glad this movie is out there for those indie wannabe type boys who only go after those wannabe indie girls with light skin and dark hair. Wake up bitches and snap into reality. The character of Summer didn't really show any passion or interest in Thomas what so ever. She just kept calling him a friend. She was pretty cold and quiet, really reserved. I'm not even sure why Thomas was attracted to besides her body because she didn't have much of a personality at all. All this makes sense at the end of the movie. Anyway, I hope anyone who watches this learned a lesson. Everything you think you know about love is crap. Forget about it.

Summer is played by Zooey, who is really down to earth. I like her freeness in life. I liked the fun he had being with her. It was sad that she tended to not exude as much energy of happiness from their creative fun and tended to start to push him away from her. They played with their imagination which is so cool in any relationship. Being able to let your guards down and play is so innocent. I liked the scene when they both did karioke. And I liked the wedding where they were just friends but still had that ability to let go and have fun. What was dissappointing was the ending and her energy towards him being not as balanced. Yet this happens in real life and that makes it a movie that shines. I liked its creativeness with the characters and its scene where it incorporates dancing and a small bit of animation.

Throughout the movie, it is kind of unclear actually as to what it is about Summer as a person that Tom, such a sensitive, funny, and smart guy, finds enticing and falls for. Besides looking cute, Summer is not particularly fun or funny, charming, kind or generous. She is aloof, cold, distanced, has no sense of humor and is kind of insincere actually. She has Tom wrapped around her little finger, leads him on and treats him like crap. Maybe her constant withholding and elusive charm is what he is attracted to?  He sure wouldnt be the first because he keeps pursuing her and goes back for more. In its essence, this movie is a story about a man loving a woman who doesnt love him back. Summer, of course, blames life and the nature of relationships for her behavior, but we all know that these are just the standard, run of the mill excuses one hears from people who dont love you.They say that the power of a relationship lies with whoever cares less. No movie exemplifies this more than this one. Summer is the one who cares less and so she clearly holds the power in this relationship, which she unkindly uses.500 days of summer is a charming, intelligent love story that arrives at common wisdom regarding love and relationships in an unconventional way.

Not all relationships are love stories, and we may not know  going in, if this person is the 'one.'  We may wonder but we may not know..This is not such a relationship, and every relationship carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit..When you listen to a story you immediately tend to identify with the lead character.  Here though, the writer cleverly flips and reverses the male female duality, so that we experience a shift and a split in perception, she is the one with walls, the realist, neat and organised, emotionally unavailable, he is the one seeking relationship, looking to break those walls and make an emotional connection, the romantic fantasist discussing the relationship  with friends. She focuses on the present. He focuses on the future.  The further you get into the movie the more you may notice yourself looking at relationships in new ways.If you're into personality types:  He is feeling and intuiting. She is thinking and sensing. Through interaction with opposites we absorb from the other person's way of doing things.What  I love  most about this movie, is  not just the acting, not just the directing, not just the storytelling, but it's fresh inventive unabashedly non linear non formula Indie beating Hollywood's formula way, giving us scenes, emotions and insights that linger long after the credits roll.What still lingers: The elated morning after scene, when you feel like high fiving the world. The Ikea scene. The French movie metaphor scene.  When the robot cries. The split screen expectations reality sequence.The story unfolds in a non linear fashion, dipping in different days at random, with a recurring skyline motif the connecting thread between scenes.  This time distortion technique somehow makes sense, partly because this is how we remember relationships.  My favorite scene is the park bench where he tells her his dream of changing the skyline, and she asks him to draw it on her forearm, and then it fades perfectly into the skyline motif, planting that seed.  The park bench becomes turning point and bookend.Joseph Gordon Levitt, whose facial expressions resemble Heath Ledger sometimes, excels as everyman Tom Hanson, who writes greeting cards but really wants to be an architect.  He played lead in  one of my favorite movies of 2006 -The Lookoutas a young man with amnesia sucked into a bank robbery.As an avid movie goer I noticed Zooey Deschanel first in Cloverfield. As the handheld camera zoomed in her baby blues reminded me a little of Meg Ryan.  Then we saw her in The Happening.  I had seen her in several other movies such as Teribithia, and I must have seen her in Weeds, and The Good Girl but I have no actual recollection.  She was outstanding as the lead inTin Man (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)mini series, the reimagining of Wizard of Oz. Now, like in the bus she seems to be everywhere.She does seem detached from her emotions, does great  deadpan facial expressions, and does seem delightfully quirky.  All these aspects contribute to her brilliance as a comedic actress as inElf (Infinifilm Edition)with Will Ferrell.  What remains to be seen is whether she continues to play to her strengths and build on that or boldly expand her emotional horizons.  Perhaps we should rename the third rock from the sun.

1242013,A129YBX5BVNW2,B001UV4XUG,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 2]","**** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY ISSUE ***30-something wannabe architect Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has worked for 4 long years in a Los Angeles greeting card company as a slogan writer dreaming of love that somehow seems to elude him. Enter a new 'average girl' employee - the heart stopping bug-eyed Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) whose very presence can make ice-cream sales increase and add value to unsellable real estate. Everything about Summer is magical and Tom's gone-baby-gone in a heartbeat (""This is not good!"" his friend quite rightly muses). And therein lies the problem. New Jersey Tom doesn't just want Summer Finn as a friend...he's thinking Soul Mate - when maybe Michigan's finest isn't thinking anything of the sort...Possessed of a freshness and wit that is so often replaced with crudity in modern world rom-coms (especially those hoping to be hip, happening and hitting the zeitgeist) - ""(500) Days Of Summer"" is exceptional is so many ways. It's lol funny a great deal of the time - visually surprising - beautifully cast and above all just keeps you watching and enjoying right up until its unexpected and satisfying end. Even movie clich&eacute;s like the dweeb friends to the lead character (superb turns by Geoffrey Arend and Matthew Grey Gubler as McKenzie and Paul) and the smart-arsed child (a droll and grown up performance by tiny Chloe Grace Moretz as his younger sister Rachel) are given such great lines that you're too busy enjoying yourself to notice piddly little things like time passing. Characters play The Smiths on their Walkman's, wear Joy Division teeshirts to work, quote Sid Vicious at dinner, want to buy Octopus's Garden in record shops and even quote Henry Miller for solace (title above). This is a very cool and likeable movie.It also uses the brilliant device of an intermittent screen page that tells you which day number we're on (flicking up and down like a counter clock). If we're on Day 36 then love is all happy-wappy and new with chirping animated birds and gymnastic sex in showers. But if we're on Day 329 then the boredom and suffocation on her part has set in - and friendship let alone love is fading fast. Many of the very funny earlier sequences explaining their upbringings are also accompanied by the dry-as-a-cactus-root droll voiceover of Richard McGonagle having a Stephen Fry type hoot with statistics on men, women, shoe size and fate. There's even a song and dance sequence - a truly life-enhancing infectious sketch played out to the magically upbeat ""You Make My Dreams"" by Hall & Oates (1981) which is the kind of cinematic genius that is guaranteed to put a smile on the most miserable of mutts.Defaulted to 2:40.1 Aspect Ratio - the BLU RAY image can be stretched to 16 x 9 without any degradation and is frequently beautiful (especially when Tom shows Summer the beautiful lesser-known architectural wonders of L.A.). There are good extras too:1. Deleted and Extended Scenes2. Bank Dance - A feature on the scene choreographed to the Hall & Oates song (as mentioned above)3. Mean's Cinemash: Sid And Nancy/(500) Days Of Summer4. A Music Video to ""Sweet Disposition"" by Temper Trap5. Conversations with Lead Actors Levitt and Deschanel6.

1242015,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001UV4XUG,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Love stories have been a staple of film since their beginning. Some are good, some bad and some memorable. But few take an objective look at love seeing both the positive and negative, the fun and the sad. That changes with 500 DAYS OF SUMMER.Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Tom Hansen, a wanna be architect now working as a greeting card writer for a small company who finds life for the most part unfulfilling. Early in life, he dreamed of meeting the perfect girl, the right one and discovering true love that would last forever.Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) is a free spirited young woman who's just begun working at the same company Tom works at. Summer is the sort who doesn't believe in true love but in living for the moment.During a meeting at work, Tom sees Summer for the first time. For Tom, its love at first sight. For Summer, it's just another day.The film doesn't follow a linear path, instead jumping from one day to another, for instance day 3 and then to day 344. What we see is the ups and downs of a romance between two young people. But what we get is a look at love, romance and the search for the perfect match.In the early days we are privy to the courtship of Summer by Tom, how he finally gets the nerve to ask her out, how he gets to know her and her getting to know him as well. And as with most romances, the two enjoy each other's company and all of the details that become second nature to them both.But as time progresses, or in this case moves back and forth, we see the change in their relationship. Gone are the small enjoyments in a look, a laugh, a whisper, replaced with finding these same things that were once treasures now annoyances. And yet, they remain together. Until the fateful day when Summer announces she wants to be friends, those killing words to any hope of being a couple.Knowing full well what the result of this relationship will be fairly early on in the film (thus knowing now is not actually a spoiler), what you get rather than the usual beginning to end romance is an offbeat style of film that entertains from start to finish. The movie covers all bases that revolve around being in love and losing love. It's filled with humor and sadness, just like real life.This movie is about dreams of romance. Not just those of the couple we witness on screen but in the dream of romance that everyone searches for in their lifetime. And while some never find it, others do. While some hope for the one to walk into their lives, others find that special someone over time. And this film captures that in its combination of vignettes that come together to form one thoroughly enjoyable movie.What is also a joy is watching the actors in this film. Gordon-Levitt gives a remarkable performance showing a depth he's not had the chance to since he starred in BRICK. Last seen in G.I.JOE as Cobra Commander, he offers a completely different performance here that show his versatility. So much so that after watching I wondered what he would choose to do next?Deschanel has always stood out as an attractive young woman who opts for characters that are a bit out of the norm. She does so once again in this film, offering a free spirit who isn't quite as free as she might think.

But -the narrator's baritone cautions- it's not a love story. It is a movie of twenty-something romantic angst with two appealing lead actors that smothers in its own self-conscious hipness. Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a sweet, neurotic greeting card writer whose girlfriend Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) decided they should stop seeing one another on the 290th day of their relationship. Tom went home and started breaking plates. As his friends and little sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz) crowd around, he recalls the good and bad of their relationship and vows to get Summer back. Tom thought she was ""the one"". Summer thought he was nice and never wanted a ""boyfriend"".It's ironic that ""500 Days of Summer"" breaks with romantic comedy convention and takes a more philosophical turn, because the rest of the movie is cribbed from the stylistic pantheon of ""independent"" filmmaking. From the parentheses in the title to the precocious child spouting dating tips, this movie is like a checklist of how to make a quirky romance: Jump around in time. Have the characters speak to the camera in pseudo-documentary black-and-white film clips. Use corny graphics to indicate mood. Add a superfluous narration. I have seen Tom's two nerdy friends in more movies than I can count. There's nothing exactly wrong with them, except that they are a clich&eacute;, and I'm not sure why he has nerdy friends. He's not a nerd. Summer wears ribbons (!) in her hair.This patchwork of self-conscious quirkiness makes everything seem insincere. This might be overlooked -with some effort- if the characters were fun to watch. But Tom is neurotic, self-defeating, childlike, insecure, and he talks a lot about his feelings. He is playing the traditional (insulting) female role in an onscreen romance, while Summer takes the typical male role. She's always the aggressor and doesn't want to be joined at the hip to anyone. There is even a conversation where the role reversal is made explicit by way of a reference to ""Sid & Nancy"" (that would be Vicious & Spungen). I'm afraid I don't think this is terribly clever. It's just another gimmick to hide a lack of creativity and basic appeal.

So he latches on to a girl named Summer who doesn't believe in love yet he still feels a connection with her and they get into something of a relationship.  His friends are of little help and pretty useless on dating advice.  Big surprise since they're part of the nerd herd.

That is how (500) Days of Summer is introduced and it holds true in what is easily one of my favorite movies of 2009. This is not a conventional romantic comedy. Instead it is one of the most honest stories about relationships I can remember ever being on screen and it really hit home.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom Hansen, a greetings card writer with aspirations of being an architect. When Summer arrives as a new employee at the office the start of their relationship begins. The movie essentially jumps back and forth between different days and the events that took place in a 500 day span. The level of excitement early is contrasted in a completely unique way with the breakdown and emotion that comes later on. Really the story is about discovery and dealing with the unexpected things that life brings.The main characters have an immense level of chemistry that really sells the story. They fit well together and are completely believable in their interactions and the development of their relationship. There is some comic relief also from the supporting characters but they don't stand out as being placed in just for that reason but instead they are along as the people who are turned to for advice despite what they maybe lack in expertise. While they do provide some laughs the parts that really got me were in relating to the situations and things said between Tom and Summer.I would not consider this a ""chick flick"" because it will resonate with everyone. Most individuals will be able to relate to the situations and emotions involved based on a relationship they have had or an opportunity missed out on in the past. In a way watching this movie was cathartic and I left it with a sense of optimism. But that isn't based on a contrived ending. Instead it is about knowing how difficult things can be but that eventually life does go on and acceptance is reached.(500) Days of Summer is worth at least a rent if not a purchase. The genuine nature of the story is unmatched and the performances were completely honest. It truly connected with me in a way that few movies do.

1242035,AZN6WMC71MGWJ,B001UV4XUG,Phip,"[1, 1]","These days there is such a steady influx of cookie cutter rom-coms that after a while they all start to look, sound, and feel the same. Some are cutesy, some are full of teenage drama, some are about as convincing as watching the opening auditions of American Idol (entertaining in the fact that they're so bad) but they're full of  fluff. And then there are those delicately crafted, smart, and charming films that you walk away from with a smile on your face, not an eye roll. For me, 500 Days of Summer is such a film.The story centers around Tom, a young man who's waiting for the girl of his dreams, and Summer, the one who he believes to fit the role. They begin a doomed relationship since Summer has made her skepticism of love due to her parents divorce when she was a girl very clear. She's just doing it for fun. I have seen this mindset among singles around me. Disillusionment with true love so they settle on just a feel-good romance or never open themselves to love at all. Does true love even really exist or is it fantasy? What does love even mean? This is the film's main theme as both Tom and Summer try to come to an answer.Some have said it was too sad or depressing for a romance-comedy. And even the narrator says up front ""This is not a love story"". There are scenes where Tom is trying to get over Summer but he's just so depressed that it starts to take a toll on the viewer. But anyone who has gone through a breakup and felt the shadow that seems to follow you everywhere can empathize with Tom. It was inspiring to see how, while he was still hurting over her, this kind of wake up call was what he needed to get control of his life. And in the end, both of them are able to believe in love again. I won't ruin it for you, but the last scene made me smile so it does end on a good note.Technically speaking, the film was surprisingly good. The acting was great, especially Summer, played by the cute and down-to-earth Zooey Deschanel. I thought her line delivery, her voice, her tinge of quirkiness was very endearing. Some might think her acting was shallow but it was a breath of fresh air to see an actress in a romance film who wasn't tan, blonde, and constantly either out of breath, in tears, or strutting in high heels. The supporting actors are also full of personality. The lines are full of wit and humor that actually made me laugh, which is always good in a successful comedy. The soundtrack and songs featuring Regina Spektor, The Smiths, and  some lower profile but talented artists was very affective with the scenes they were matched with. And it was a concise hour and a half which is always nice when you're just in the mood for a quick feel-good movie. I've watched it probably half a dozen times and it doesn't  gets old. Really, a surprisingly good film that I think people on both sides of the spectrum can enjoy.",5,"Smart, charming, and subtly profound.

Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) are two people who work for the New Hampshire Greeting Cards Company who happen to strike a friendship that goes beyond casual.  Summer is up front about not forging a serious relationship but Tom already has preconceived notions that he is going to make this a long-term affair.  And with that in mind, the complexities begin.The film intermittently goes through the 500 days in which the couple is involved.  From the honeymoon stage to the final disintegration of their bond, what boils down to a friendship becomes Tom's obsession that dwells on two premises, expectations and reality.  With humor and subtle serious moments, the movie flows quite nicely.  The most interesting part of the film is the humor that overshadows various scenes showing Tom's disappointment, such as he being counseled by his little sister, Rachel (Chloe Grace Moretz) for relationship advice despite she looking somewhat of pre-pubescent age and the short vignettes that play on classic foreign films, Ingmar Bergman's Seventh Sign and Jean Luc-Goddard's Breathless and the song and dance number to a Hall and Oates tune, and the karaoke scenes.500 Days of Summer is by no means an artsy film but rather an intelligently done independent film that observes the ups and downs of Tom and Summer's year and a half long romance.  Overall, Mark Water's production and Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber's screenplay and the various songs from The Smiths and other independent-alternative bands and artists complement the film's soundtrack as well.

It is a love story about two young people who find their way in a big city from a small town.  They are young and bright eyed but also seriously under-employed.  Young man is an architect who happens to work in a greeting card company, composing designs and text for the Hallmark like card.

Certainly, the subject has been explored ad nauseum by studios looking to cash in with the idiot crowd. Surprise! Director Marc Webb and writers Michael Webber and Mike Newstator have created a piece that could happen now or at any time. The situations to which Tom was subjected are timeless. I was him, back in the 60's. That's what makes it special. Two individuals with separate agendas get together and like each other a lot, but the important thing is that they are ""individuals"". The erratic time element is quite fine, giving coherence to that frightening enigma that some call ""LOVE"". Zooey Deschanel as the free spirited Summer handles her role like the pro that she is, a very underrated actress. Most special is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom, a regular guy, Mr. Cool wannabe, and, quite simply, a guy looking for validation. Mr. Gordon-Levitt has shown remarkable work in the past (I really liked him in  ""Mysterious Skin""), a fine transition from TV brat (3rd Rock) to legitimate player to be reckoned with. My admiration of his career continues to grow. Though episodic, ""(500) Days of Summer"" held my interest to find out what how Tom would deal with the next/past endeavor to find true love.

1242043,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B001UV4XUG,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[1, 1]","Don't be fooled by the opening narration. '(500) Days of Summer' is very much a love story. Just not the kind we're used to seeing.Come to think of it, the title's also a little misleading. This is really the story of Tom Hanson, and the 500 days he spends being in love with Summer. But while we get to know Tom very well, thanks in large part to a charming and nuanced portrayal by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, by the end of the movie Summer remains something of an enigma, right down to Zooey Deschanel's last sly smile.Since this movie is really about Tom and his experiences with (and without) Summer, that works just fine. Besides, '(500) Days of Tom' just doesn't sound as cool.'(500) Days of Summer' gets a lot of credit, though, for making a real attempt at being honest, both with its audience and its characters. Tom and Summer are not cardboard cutouts fit into a standard romance storyline. They challenge the gender stereotypes we often see in movies, and they feel like real people, with their faults and their hangups and their silliness.Only occasionally does the movie dip into the deep well of the trite situation (i.e. an overplayed scene in a record shop or the drunk buddy who says too much), but these are mostly forgivable in a movie with sudden, unexpected bursts of pure inspired fun, like a scene in which Tom feels on top of the world (guess why) and everything around him is made for his delight. If you haven't seen this already, I won't ruin it by trying to summarize it, but it makes the whole movie worth seeing. In fact, just go watch it now.Ok, you're back? Good. Told you it was awesome.'(500) Days of Summer' unfolds as a series of memories played out of sequence. Don't worry about getting lost, though, as each new memory is labeled so you know at least roughly where it falls, and the movie quickly finds its rhythm so the numbers are almost unnecessary. I love this aspect of the movie, as it feels like someone who is reliving the highs and lows of the relationship as they relate to how he felt about it, at the time and now. There's a subtlety about how the subjectivity of memory is conveyed here that I admire.Overall, this is a sharply honest, delightfully quirky, and mostly original movie about love. It reminds me mostly of one of my favorites: 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' which is even more striking and original in its approach. Both movies, though, share the perspective that love and romance are often messy and complicated, and working through the push and pull of attraction and independence is rarely as simple as we're often led to believe.'(500) Days of Summer' may try to mislead you with its title and its opening lines. It may try to make you think it's not for romantics. But don't be fooled. By being honest, making me laugh unexpectedly, and especially for appreciating the differences that make us unique, it earned its way into my heart.

They are two of the best young talents we have in Hollywood today. The two of them have a unique charm on their own, so together they really bring this story to life in a way that could not have been anticipated on paper. Their chemistry is intoxicating. You can't help but feel invested in their relationship, so when the inevitable happens, it hurts that much more. I also loved their dynamic, and how they played off of the supporting cast. I should also mention little Chloe Moretz (Kick-Ass and Let Me In). She played Tom's wise little sister with enough relationship advice to put Dr. Phil out of business.Mark Webb did a fantastic job behind the camera as well. He's put himself on my list of favorite filmmakers with this film and The Amazing Spider-Man. Music is a big part of this movie, and is another thing that makes it so great. The audio could be better, but it's more than sufficient. The picture quality is also pretty damn impressive, even if not reference quality. I hate it when they have Bollywood musical type dance numbers, but this movie was so great that it can get away with it. When I first saw this movie in its theatrical run, I liked it.

1242046,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001UV4XUG,RMurray847,"[4, 13]","(500) DAYS OF SUMMER is a cute movie with two very likeable stars.  It's narrator tells us at the beginning, ""this is NOT a love story,"" but it is at the very least a story of romance.  We meet Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a greeting card writer who really wanted to be an architect and is CERTAINLY a hopeless romantic.  He's painfully shy, but we just know from the sincere twinkle in his eyes that he's a good guy.  One day (Day 1), Tom's boss gets a new assistant, Summer (Zooey Deschanel).  She's lovely, vaguely zany, has huge, twinkly eyes and Tom immediately falls for her.  Because  he's shy, it takes awhile for a true relationship to build.Summer tells Tom she isn't looking for love, and doesn't even believe in it.  Tom, we know, IS looking for love, and he believes very strongly and sincerely that  he's found it with Summer.  So he's torn by his desire to find his soulmate in Summer, yet distraught by the fact that as they move from day 30 to day 150, she still won't even say that they are boyfriend/girlfriend.  She seems to like Tom a great deal...and they seem to make a good couple.  But she continues to make it clear to Tom that they are ""just friends"" and that their friendship cannot lead to anything deeper...since Summer doesn't even believe in that.It's a simple dilemma for Tom, who is really our ""hero.""  Can his love finally win her over to him, can he be happy just being friends-with-benefits, or should he cut her loose and look elsewhere?  For Summer, will she realize she's somewhat stringing the guy along, because even though she SAYS they aren't ""a couple"" she sure acts like they are for a very long time?This is a 3.5 star kind of movie for me.  The performers are charming, although Summer's character, to me, was really more of an idea than a real person.  I never bought her single-minded refusal to understand that when you practically live with a guy and share your bed and your free time with him for around a year you can't just be nothing special.  Deschanel is most certainly a most interesting actress.  Gordon-Levitt has long since left behind his 3RD ROCK NEXT TO THE SUN persona and has emerged as a true force, at least in ""indie"" films.  The film contains many, many wry observations and cut scenes.  The two have a couple of silly but charming scenes at their local IKEA.However, this 3.5 star film became a 2.5 star film when Director Marc Webb and writers Scott Neustatder & Michael Weber felt their film needed to jump around in time.  As the film goes on, we jump from (for example) day 488 back to day 15 to day 186 to day 30 and then back to 488...and so on and so on.  It's not confusing to keep up with, don't get me wrong...but it is pointless.  I don't think anything was gained from this device...and to be honest, much was lost.  My wife and I both agreed upon walking from the theatre that it felt like ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND-lite.  Yet, where that movie had a reason for its time-jumping (and would not really even have worked without it)...500 DAYS just feels needlessly meandering.  The use of a narrator was needlessly fanciful...most of what was explained to us could have been readily understood through the script and performances.  There are other ""fantasy"" sequences in the film...most notably a scene the morning after Tom and Summer first make love.  He's bursting with joy, and as he strides from his apartment, we see him strutting to Hall & Oates' YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE.  This eventually turns into a full blown production number (although a low budget one)...and felt like ENCHANTED meets the awkward moments in SPIDERMAN 3 when Tobey Maguire struts around to ""Staying Alive.""  (Full disclosure time:  I've always kinda liked that song, so the whole scene put a smile on my face.  Frankly, if the film were going to go this way, it needed MORE out-and-out fantasy.  What we get is a ""gritty, little romance"" peppered with jarring bursts of tone from another film altogether.)I gather this is a first directorial effort for Webb.  He seems to have a nice way with actors...but he doesn't frame shots terribly well and he makes the city of LA look drab.  Even when Tom is showing Summer the architecture he enjoys in the city, there is no joy in the seeing of it.  (I think of Sam Waterston's architect showing Dianne Wiest and Carrie Fisher around in HANNAH AND HER SISTERS.  Woody Allen knows how to make a city seem romantic.)So, 500 DAYS OF SUMMER crumbles a little bit under the weight of its artiness...but even so, you may find just enough to appeal to you when you get past the trickery and find the heart of the film.",3,"Gordon-Levitt & Deschanel have charm to burn, but the film doesn't need all the trickery",1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,4632,"['500', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'SUMMER', 'cute', 'movie', 'two', 'very', 'likeable', 'stars', 'narrator', 'beginning', 'NOT', 'love', 'story', 'very', 'least', 'story', 'romance', 'meet', 'Tom', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'greeting', 'card', 'writer', 'who', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'architect', 'CERTAINLY', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'painfully', 'shy', 'just', 'know', 'sincere', 'twinkle', 'eyes', 'good', 'guy', 'One', 'day', 'Day', '1', 'Tom', 'boss', 'new', 'assistant', 'Summer', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'lovely', 'vaguely', 'zany', 'huge', 'twinkly', 'eyes', 'Tom', 'immediately', 'shy', 'awhile', 'true', 'relationship', 'build.Summer', 'tells', 'Tom', ""n't"", 'looking', 'love', ""n't"", 'even', 'believe', 'Tom', 'know', 'IS', 'looking', 'love', 'very', 'strongly', 'sincerely', 'found', 'Summer', 'torn', 'desire', 'find', 'soulmate', 'Summer', 'yet', 'distraught', 'fact', 'move', 'day', '30', 'day', '150', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'are', 'boyfriend/girlfriend', 'like', 'Tom', 'great', 'deal', 'seem', 'make', 'good', 'couple', 'make', 'clear', 'Tom', 'are', 'just', 'friends', 'friendship', 'can', 'not', 'lead', 'anything', 'deeper', 'Summer', ""n't"", 'even', 'believe', 'that.It', 'simple', 'dilemma', 'Tom', 'who', 'really', 'hero', 'Can', 'love', 'finally', 'win', 'can', 'be', 'happy', 'just', 'being', 'friends-with-benefits', 'should', 'cut', 'loose', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Summer', 'will', 'realize', 'somewhat', 'stringing', 'guy', 'along', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'couple', 'sure', 'acts', 'are', 'very', 'long', 'time', '3.5', 'star', 'kind', 'movie', 'performers', 'are', 'charming', 'Summer', 'character', 'was', 'really', 'more', 'idea', 'real', 'person', 'never', 'bought', 'single-minded', 'refusal', 'understand', 'when', 'practically', 'live', 'guy', 'share', 'bed', 'free', 'time', 'year', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'nothing', 'special', 'Deschanel', 'most', 'certainly', 'most', 'interesting', 'actress', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'long', 'left', '3RD', 'ROCK', 'NEXT', 'TO', 'THE', 'SUN', 'persona', 'emerged', 'true', 'force', 'least', 'indie', 'films', 'film', 'many', 'many', 'wry', 'observations', 'cut', 'scenes', 'two', 'have', 'couple', 'silly', 'charming', 'scenes', 'local', 'IKEA.However', '3.5', 'star', 'film', 'became', '2.5', 'star', 'film', 'when', 'Director', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'writers', 'Scott', 'Neustatder', 'Michael', 'Weber', 'felt', 'film', 'needed', 'jump', 'time', 'film', 'jump', 'example', 'day', '488', 'back', 'day', '15', 'day', '186', 'day', '30', 'then', 'back', '488', 'so', 'so', 'not', 'confusing', 'keep', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'pointless', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'was', 'gained', 'device', 'be', 'honest', 'much', 'was', 'lost', 'wife', 'agreed', 'walking', 'theatre', 'felt', 'ETERNAL', 'SUNSHINE', 'THE', 'SPOTLESS', 'MIND-lite', 'where', 'movie', 'had', 'reason', 'time-jumping', 'would', 'not', 'really', 'even', 'have', 'worked', '500', 'DAYS', 'just', 'needlessly', 'meandering', 'use', 'narrator', 'was', 'needlessly', 'fanciful', 'most', 'what', 'was', 'explained', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'readily', 'understood', 'script', 'performances', 'are', 'other', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'scene', 'morning', 'Tom', 'Summer', 'first', 'make', 'love', 'bursting', 'joy', 'apartment', 'see', 'strutting', 'Hall', 'Oates', 'YOU', 'MAKE', 'MY', 'DREAMS', 'COME', 'TRUE', 'eventually', 'full', 'blown', 'production', 'number', 'low', 'budget', 'one', 'felt', 'ENCHANTED', 'awkward', 'moments', 'SPIDERMAN', '3', 'when', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Staying', 'Alive', 'Full', 'disclosure', 'time', ""'ve"", 'always', 'kinda', 'liked', 'song', 'whole', 'scene', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'Frankly', 'film', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'way', 'needed', 'MORE', 'out-and-out', 'fantasy', 'What', 'get', 'gritty', 'little', 'romance', 'peppered', 'jarring', 'bursts', 'tone', 'film', 'altogether', 'gather', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Webb', 'have', 'nice', 'way', 'actors', ""n't"", 'frame', 'shots', 'terribly', 'well', 'city', 'LA', 'look', 'drab', 'Even', 'when', 'Tom', 'showing', 'Summer', 'architecture', 'city', 'joy', 'seeing', 'think', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'architect', 'showing', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'HANNAH', 'AND', 'HER', 'SISTERS', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'how', 'make', 'city', 'seem', 'romantic', 'So', '500', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'SUMMER', 'little', 'bit', 'weight', 'artiness', 'even', 'so', 'may', 'find', 'just', 'enough', 'appeal', 'when', 'get', 'trickery', 'find', 'heart', 'film']",N/A

Well, amazingly, now we have another one, which not only hits on all cylinders, but brings some top-quality acting to the mix as well.Tom (Brick's Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of those guys who, in a less politically correct world, we used to call hopeless romantics. He's looking for that one true love. One day, he sees Summer (The Good Girl's Zooey Deschanel), and lightning strikes. The rest of the movie chronicles their five-hundred-day relationship in two parallel timelines. The first covers the first half (roughly) of that time, while they're dating. The second covers the second half, after they've broken up (this is not a spoiler; the trailer, the intro voiceover, and the first scene all reveal it).Yes, that's the entire plot. Thus, the movie has to hinge on its two main characters. I love Joseph Gordon-Levitt and will watch him in anything, so that base is covered. Deschanel, on the other hand, I've never been nearly as fond of, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect here. Turns out that this is the first movie I've encountered her in where she really shines instead of being an upscale Juliette Lewis clone. The chemistry between the two is completely believable, which seems to be increasingly rare these days, and Webb takes this movie to the next level in the little details. These characters have little quirks that don't exist as big emotional shortcuts later, they're just two kids being silly. Hey, Hollywood? In case you haven't noticed, this sort of thing works really well. Maybe you should use it in more rom-coms. Add in a few amusing, nerdy sidekicks and, well, you've got yourself a movie.I loved this. It's not something with the same gravitas as, say, Pontypool or Tokyo Story, but that's part of its charm. Well, that plus being the best romantic comedy in ages. See it.

1242050,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001UV4XUG,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","""(500) Days of Summer"" is not the first movie to tell a love story using an unorthodox chronology - with ""Two For the Road,"" ""Betrayal"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" having done brilliant trailblazing work in this area long ago.  Yet, while ""Summer"" is not quite in the same league with those three earlier masterpieces, it`s certainly miles above the formulaic nonsense that too often passes for romantic comedy these days.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who in ""Mysterious Skin"" delivered one of the truly searing dramatic performances of recent times, here displays a similar adeptness at light comedy playing Tom Hansen, a greeting-card writer who falls head-over-heels in love with Summer Finn (the adorable Zooey Deschanel), a newly-hired assistant in the office.While Tom is dead-set on having a meaningful, permanent relationship, Summer feels no compulsion to throw herself into any kind of long-term commitment, determined to savor the freedom that comes with being attractive and unattached in a buzzing metropolis like Los Angeles.Rather than following a strictly linear chronology, the screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Mark H. Weber freely jumps around in time, a technique that allows us to observe the various stages of the couple's courtship simultaneously.  But fear not, for the writers are careful to identify, through numbered title cards, which of the 500 days any particular scene is taking place on so the audience doesn`t become disoriented.  This ""dramatic irony"" approach of letting us in on where the relationship will eventually wind up - beyond what even the characters themselves know at the time - adds an additional layer of poignancy to the romance.Astutely directed by Marc Webb, ""(500) Days of Summer"" is marked by smart writing, perceptive storytelling, charming performances, occasional flights of fancy and a rich attention to detail.  And there's a scene on a park bench near the end of the movie that is absolutely heartbreaking.A quick FYI:  for a far more somber version of pretty much the same story, check out the equally fine ""The Hottest State"" by Ethan Hawke.  Together, these two films would make for an interesting double-bill.",4,a romantic comedy that actually works,1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,2182,"['500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'not', 'first', 'movie', 'tell', 'love', 'story', 'using', 'unorthodox', 'chronology', 'Two', 'Road', 'Betrayal', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'having', 'done', 'brilliant', 'trailblazing', 'work', 'area', 'long', 'ago', 'Summer', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'league', 'three', 'earlier', 'masterpieces', 's', 'certainly', 'miles', 'formulaic', 'nonsense', 'too', 'often', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'days.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'who', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'delivered', 'one', 'truly', 'searing', 'dramatic', 'performances', 'recent', 'times', 'here', 'similar', 'adeptness', 'light', 'comedy', 'playing', 'Tom', 'Hansen', 'greeting-card', 'writer', 'who', 'head-over-heels', 'love', 'Summer', 'Finn', 'adorable', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'newly-hired', 'assistant', 'office.While', 'Tom', 'dead-set', 'having', 'meaningful', 'permanent', 'relationship', 'Summer', 'compulsion', 'throw', 'kind', 'long-term', 'commitment', 'determined', 'savor', 'freedom', 'being', 'attractive', 'unattached', 'buzzing', 'metropolis', 'Los', 'Angeles.Rather', 'following', 'strictly', 'linear', 'chronology', 'screenplay', 'Scott', 'Neustadter', 'Mark', 'H.', 'Weber', 'freely', 'time', 'technique', 'observe', 'various', 'stages', 'couple', 'courtship', 'simultaneously', 'fear', 'not', 'writers', 'are', 'careful', 'identify', 'numbered', 'title', 'cards', '500', 'days', 'particular', 'scene', 'taking', 'place', 'audience', 'doesn', 't', 'become', 'disoriented', 'dramatic', 'irony', 'approach', 'letting', 'where', 'relationship', 'will', 'eventually', 'wind', 'up', 'what', 'even', 'characters', 'know', 'time', 'additional', 'layer', 'poignancy', 'romance.Astutely', 'directed', 'Marc', 'Webb', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'marked', 'smart', 'writing', 'perceptive', 'storytelling', 'charming', 'performances', 'occasional', 'flights', 'fancy', 'rich', 'attention', 'detail', 'scene', 'park', 'bench', 'end', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'heartbreaking.A', 'quick', 'FYI', 'far', 'more', 'somber', 'version', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'story', 'check', 'out', 'equally', 'fine', 'Hottest', 'State', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Together', 'two', 'films', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'double-bill']",N/A
1242051,A13D4E28S63SYF,B001UV4XUG,"Ron ""true faith""","[7, 9]","(500) DAYS OF SUMMER comes the closest to a sensitive guy's point of view on romantic love than any other film I have seen.  I thought FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL came pretty close, but not anymore.  The one scene in FOUR WEDDINGS that I liked was when the Hugh Grant character wondered if he was being too selective in choosing the perfect wife thereby preventing him from finding true love.  Now (500) DAYS takes that a step further.  First, the narrative structure of the film is exactly the way we remember a failed relationship.  We don't start at the beginning and then work our way to the end--we jump around.  We remember the good times, the bad times, and wonder why the relationship didn't work out.  Second, when a relationship doesn't work out, we're quick to rule out that true love exists.  This happened in FOUR WEDDINGS and (500) DAYS.  The difference between the two films is that in FOUR WEDDINGS, the Grant character gets the girl of his dreams in the end.  **SPOILER ALERT**  In (500) DAYS, the opposite happens.  Although Summer was initally attracted to Tom probably because he liked The Smiths, she never fell in love with him.  This is something that's hard for Tom (or most guys) to understand.  We like to be in control of our relationship (or have the girl love us back) and when we're not, we take it as a personal rejection.  This may not sound like much, but it's really true.  Look at the love stories where the guy is the mentor to the girl, such as PYGMALION, MY FAIR LADY, ANNIE HALL, etc.  The guy is the mentor because he is controlling the girl to think the way he does.  Third, (500) DAYS explores the question if love is accidental or if we can do something about it?  I loved the film clips of THE GRADUATE in it because it seemed to suggest that if you want to get the girl of your dreams, you have to do something about it, including banging on the windows of a church in Santa Barbara, CA.  But then (500) DAYS made it seem like Tom and Summer's relationship was accidental.  No matter what Tom did, there was no way Summer was going to fall in love with him because there just was no chemistry between them--at least from her end.  Anyway, this review has gone on long enough.

All in all, I was disappointed with a movie that was very fragmented and that made it very clear very early just what it was leading to at the end.  It's very predictable, and its jumping-around-in-time format seemed more gimmicky than necessary for telling the story.  Add to that the main character's self-absorbed personality which doesn't allow him to see that his ""girlfriend"" has issues of his own, and there's not a whole lot here to like.  When the protagonist spends most of his time feeling sorry for himself, it becomes a bit difficult to continue to watch.  Even as I write this, my thoughts about the film are fragmented and unclear--I feel like I've just been shown a test, and my job is to put everything back in an order that will tell an actual story and allow the viewer to feel something other than confusion and expectation.

A cute play on words (since Zooey Deschanel's character is named Summer), the film is a bittersweet look at an almost two-year romance between Tom and Summer.  Tom Hansen (played adroitly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a typical guy with a dead-end job at a greeting card company, a job he settled for when he gave up looking for his dream job as an architect.  Summer is hired as the boss's assistant, and some sort of a relationship develops between the two.  Tom falls head-over-heels for Summer, and we can see why; she's cute as can be, bright, flirty, and a bit distant.  A sure-fire recipe for a serious love affair-at least on Tom's part.The movie cleverly jumps around, from meeting at work, to a few tentative dates, to a more physical relationship, to Summer telling Tom that she's young and free, and wants it to keep it that way.They say that in every relationship, one partner is more committed to the relationship, and to the other, than the second party.  That's true here, and Tom is the fall guy.  She finally tells him that she wants to 'just be friends' (ouch), but they keep running into each other.  Finally, Summer meets another man, gets engaged, and the relationship between the two leads seems doomed.I liked the film more than I thought, probably because (as any other guy) I can relate exactly to being in that position, that is, really thinking that someone is very, very special, and they thinking not at all the same.  Of course, most of the time one finds that out soon.  Poor Tom had to wait at least six months or so.  Summer, I think, just didn't want to be left alone.This rings true to this reviewer.  His friends are very believable in their relationship with Tom, going so far as to fix him up with someone else to get Tom's mind off of Summer.  Summer is believable in the casual cruelness she on occasion exhibits, just because she doesn't want to be alone.Recommended.  'The 500 Days of Summer' shows snappy, believable dialog and characters, both major and minor.  Even Tom's boss' actions ring true, for a small company who is willing to give one of their long-time employees a break when he is obviously in pain.

""This is not a love story, this is a story about LOVE"" so true!!We see the man, Tom, being the weak/hopeless romantic/dreamer and the girl ,Summer, the strong/cold/dont want to get attached attitude and they did a fblous job because the story its SO real, its a nice indie film i watched it twice in the movie theather and i want to own it so bad. Its refreshing to see that boys cry too and they fall in love, its not always the woman getting hurt, and in this story Summer its not evil or a whor# like in most movies that either you are bad or good, she is just human, honest, and young! like she says: ""We are young might as well just have fun while we can"" *-* i talk like that! and im a girl... so yeah i relate! hahaTHE SOUNDTRACK wow you have to own it too, i love how they picked these great songs that fit perfectly and makes the film even better, the music plays a major role in the movie, we are exposed to Tom's moods through music.The thing people dont like about the movie its that they jump from one day to the other with no cronological order, but i actually liked that, because you see the ups n downs, makes you focus and pay attention to the relationship how it evolves and changes.

I'm very happy I rolled the dice and had my friends talk me into seeing this film. For once I found a lead in a romantic comedy I could relate to! Joseph gordon-levitt plays an indie music obsessed greeting card writer named Tom who falls for his manager's secretary, Summer(Played by the funny and beautiful Zooey Deschanel). It turns out they both love The Smiths and going to the movies and after a few awkward work oriented nights out on the town, the two start seeing each other, There's only one problem. Summer doesn't believe that true love exists, and though Tom falls further for her, Summer refuses to get attached. The film follows the 500 days of their relationship in a scattered pattern which highlight the joys and pains of making it work. Watching the two as they take a childish romp through IKEA in one scene and breakup at a dinner in the next was like watching a bitter-sweet slide show that just about anybody can say""yeah, I've been there"". Aside from being a truly enjoyable love story, the film's strength is in the comedy. Tom's therapy sessions with his much younger and much wiser little sister are hilarious and his romantically clueless friends play great sidekicks. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel have perfect on screen chemistry and they seemed comfortable and natural working together. I laughed with them and was reminded of that awful ache they call heartbreak.

This has a slight down beat, mildly melancholy, feel to it and although it has funny moments throughout and I laughed at numerous points, it has a poignancy not hinted at in the trailers. It also has a great soundtrack, which features The Temper Trap, which only adds to the film. Both main actors play their parts well and there are some unique and stylish direction techniques used.

Your first clue as to the script deficiencies is the voice over. Although the voice over is not constant, it is irritating whenever it occurs and red flags holes in the script. Although the idea of skipping randomly between dates in the relationship between the 2 main characters is clever in principle, it is overused and gets monotonous as the movie drones on. About halfway through, you get fidgety and start looking at your watch. Perhaps the most critical failure is the 180 degree shift in Summer's character by the end of the movie. The first 90% of the movie gives a detailed character study of a woman who is independent and doesn't believe in quaint concepts like love at first sight which is refreshing if not perfectly written. The final part of the movie totally undermines the first 90% which so painstakingly created Summer's character. To cap off the disappointment with Summer, the male lead just happens to find a new perfect love of his life named Autumn just as the movie ends. It is far too pat and indicates that the writers (or studio) simply chickened out and wanted a totally unconvincing happy ending.

This definitely makes the recommendation list for both genders and all adult-aged groups looking for a smart, well written story. The Blu took hours to watch all it had to offer so I figure fans of this film will be wanting to know about the BD: worth it.The picture quality is solid most of the time (reference the facial hair visible to the count during the final bench scene between them), with the split screens being the only real falter I saw. The DTS is well done and much clearer than the last few DTS films I watched this weekend. The supplements are lengthy and include:* Making-of, 29:21 minutes. The unique style of filmmaking and storyline come across to the features also. The interviews and logistics of making this are covered in such a way as to not be boring. 30 minutes can go long on docs like this but it was worth the time.* Summer at Sundance, 13:46 minutes. The usual coverage of a behind-the-scenes look at doing the Sundance thing, with a couple extra jokes thrown in.* Audition tapes, optional commentary on Gubler, Arend - never been a fan of these.* Storyboards, optional commentary. Different angles of a couple scenes, lasts a few minutes.* Bank Dance, 4:17 minutes. A great sequence that could be a short film on its own - worth your time if you pick this as the only supplement to watch; essentially a musical/dance number with our main two cast during a bank robbery.* Sid & Nancy, 3:28 minutes. A brief skit on our main two role-playing again, except all dressed up in the circa clothing and fighting away.* Music video, 3:55 minutes. Sweet Disposition by Temper Trap. Trippy little video with lots of interesting visuals.* Conversations with Zooey & Levitt, 12:26 minutes. This was one of the most sincere interview sessions I have seen as a supplement. They ask each other questions over coffee and are having a good time doing it. Great material if you are into these two actors.* Filmmaking specials, 4 segments totaling 6 minutes. The director gets couch-interviewed over varying topics including casting, the French references and color palettes. Was a little irritating as no play all option so you have to re-navigate each time.* Filmmaking specials, 2 segments from Fox for less than 6 minutes. Standard fluff interviews for the Fox network.* Commentary with the director, the two writers and Levitt. You will probably dig this if after watching the making-of you get an idea of what the crew's personalities are like - and you want to hear them talk for a couple hours.* Deleted & Extended scenes, 14:42 minutes. Some of them were funny and/or relevant so I would have liked them in the film, but I understand why they cut out everyone talking to the camera, would have felt a little too much like Paper Heart.The audio is 5.1 DTS, a descriptive audio track is included, also Spanish, French, or Port 5.1. Subtitled in English, Spanish, Cantonese, Port, Mandarin and Thai. Region A coded. Disc 2 is the Dig Copy for Mac & PC. You can download the free app for doing the iPhone stuff also.As stated in the film, a story about love, but not a love story. Overall a great product worth the purchase for fans and non-fans alike.

1242067,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B001UV4XUG,Steven Aldersley,"[2, 2]","I sometimes wonder whether Fox Searchlight is a term meaning indie stuff that Steve is quite likely to enjoy. It's amazing how often that's true. My favorites from Fox Searchlight include The Descendants, Juno, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Darjeeling Limited, Slumdog Millionaire, Thank You for Smoking, Once, 127 Hours, Black Swan, Little Miss Sunshine, and Martha Marcy May Marlene.The movie immediately grabbed my attention during the opening credits which contain the following message:AUTHOR'S NOTE: The following is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to any persons living or dead is purely coincidental.Especially you Jenny Beckman.B*tch.Yes, (500) Days of Summer is deliberately quirky. It tells the story of the relationship between Tom Hansen (Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Deschanel). Because the majority of the events have already happened, the story is told in a series of flashbacks from Tom's viewpoint. To muddle things further, it jumps around at random, using title cards to show which of the 500 days of the relationship is being remembered. This has the effect of keeping us off balance; one moment we are sharing Tom's hope that he will end up with Summer, and then we see the relationship already established and about to fall apart. If it had been told in a strictly linear fashion, it wouldn't have worked so well.Other storytelling devices involve the use of a sarcastic narrator, a split screen showing Tom's expectations and the reality, and his discussions with his sister, Rachel (Moretz), who is about 11 years old. I particularly liked Rachel's character. Although she's just 11, she makes a lot more sense than her older brother. She's deliberately portrayed as being wise and intelligent, and her simple advice seems so obvious that we wonder why Tom has made his relationship with Summer as complicated as it is.Why is it complicated?Summer doesn't like to label things, so she doesn't want to be thought of as Tom's girlfriend, insisting that they are friends. Tom feels insecure without that defined structure, and wants to know where the relationship is heading. He thinks that two people who regularly have sex must be more than friends. Summer insists that she doesn't believe in true love, and just wants to have fun.Many of the scenes are genuinely funny. Tom works as a greeting card writer, and his failing relationship starts to bleed into his work. I can't reveal exactly how, but you'll laugh when you see the scene. Another strong element is music. Tom is portrayed as someone who grew up listening to sad British punk bands, and I smiled when he's shown wearing Joy Division T-shirts. He first attracts Summer's attention by listening to The Smiths when she bumps into him in an elevator. There's also a good scene which takes place at a karaoke bar, which showcases Deschanel's singing ability and has Tom performing a passable version of The Pixies' Here Comes Your Man.Apart from wanting to be in a serious relationship with Summer, Tom also dreams of being an architect. One of his favorite spots to view buildings sets the scene for several of his memories from the 500 days. Summer is an administrative assistant at Tom's company and apparently doesn't dream about doing anything else with her life.Relationships are unpredictable, and I think that the movie is using the unconventional narrative to stress that point. It's not something to be taken seriously, but there are a few truths revealed along its meandering journey. I've watched it several times, but I have to be in the right mood. It's the sort of movie that might be annoying if you are looking for something with a definite message.The $7.5 million budget seems tiny in comparison to director Marc Webb's next feature, The Amazing Spider-Man (estimated at $230 million), but it's a good first effort.Zooey Deschanel seems ideal for these kind of roles, whereas Joseph Gordon-Levitt has shown that he can mix comedy with serious drama.

From clever juxtapositions of events and the seamless integration of classic films, traditional animation, and a morose narrator, to unique editing and a visual calendar of fledgling love and tragic heartache, ""Summer"" transcends the romantic comedy genre to become an engagingly mature, yet whimsical look at that ever-so-fragile emotion and its effects both glorious and dispiriting.(500) Days of Summer chronicles the relationship of Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), two employees at a greeting card company with very different ideologies on love. Traveling back and forth in time throughout their 500 days together, pieces of their journey are steadily revealed to create a portrait of love at once wonderfully triumphant and agonizingly heartbreaking.The narrator tells us that this is a ""boy meets girl"" story, but that it is not about love. Perhaps it's the power of coincidence, the ideals of destiny, the wonders of fate, the harsh contradictions between expectations and reality, or real love in disguise. The film may use a well-known storytelling idea, but there's nothing ordinary about its execution. (500) Days of Summer portrays a ""typical"" modern romance with extraordinary methods, including split screens, slow-motion, characters talking to the camera, a full-blown dance sequence, and an impressionistic, foreign, artsy, black-and-white experimental tidbit (among many other fascinatingly inventive techniques).Tom holds movies, songs, and even greeting cards responsible for preventing people from saying what they really feel and for the corruption of emotions, causing them (especially love) to be completely indefinable. It's a fantasy that can only be recognized by or compared to peers who believe they've attained it. During his evolving perception of love, we see a spectrum as diverse as the special effects and soundtrack that compliment the imagery.Using his younger sister as a rational, intellectual source for advice on love further fuels the deconstruction of maturity which otherwise might serve as an indication of education on the subject; here it is as contrasting as the editing that cuts back and forth between Tom's utmost happiness and bitter despair. Summer is the ""dude,"" looking for casual, no-pressure romance, taking the role of the stereotypical, uncaring guy and not the relationship-demanding, over-affectionate girl. She's against the grain, not commonplace; she's Sid, not Nancy. And because of these opposing variances to the romantic dramedy formula, (500) Days of Summer is fresh, different and entirely worthwhile.- The Massie Twins",4,500 Days of Summer Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1245369600,"06 19, 2009",2009,2841,"['might', 'be', 'unjust', 'call', 'love', 'story', 'heart', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'conventional', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'multitude', 'brilliant', 'inventions', 'heightening', 'tale', 'chasing', 'dreams', 'fateful', 'fantasy', 'clever', 'juxtapositions', 'events', 'seamless', 'integration', 'classic', 'films', 'traditional', 'animation', 'morose', 'narrator', 'unique', 'editing', 'visual', 'calendar', 'fledgling', 'love', 'tragic', 'heartache', 'Summer', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'genre', 'become', 'engagingly', 'mature', 'yet', 'whimsical', 'look', 'ever-so-fragile', 'emotion', 'effects', 'glorious', 'dispiriting', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'relationship', 'Tom', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Summer', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'two', 'employees', 'greeting', 'card', 'company', 'very', 'different', 'ideologies', 'love', 'Traveling', 'back', 'forth', 'time', '500', 'days', 'together', 'pieces', 'journey', 'are', 'steadily', 'revealed', 'create', 'portrait', 'love', 'once', 'wonderfully', 'triumphant', 'agonizingly', 'heartbreaking.The', 'narrator', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'story', 'not', 'love', 'Perhaps', 'power', 'coincidence', 'ideals', 'destiny', 'wonders', 'fate', 'harsh', 'contradictions', 'expectations', 'reality', 'real', 'love', 'disguise', 'film', 'may', 'use', 'well-known', 'storytelling', 'idea', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'execution', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'typical', 'modern', 'romance', 'extraordinary', 'methods', 'including', 'split', 'screens', 'slow-motion', 'characters', 'talking', 'camera', 'full-blown', 'dance', 'sequence', 'impressionistic', 'foreign', 'artsy', 'black-and-white', 'experimental', 'tidbit', 'many', 'other', 'fascinatingly', 'inventive', 'techniques', '.Tom', 'movies', 'songs', 'even', 'greeting', 'cards', 'responsible', 'preventing', 'people', 'saying', 'what', 'really', 'feel', 'corruption', 'emotions', 'causing', 'especially', 'love', 'be', 'completely', 'indefinable', 'fantasy', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'recognized', 'compared', 'peers', 'who', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'attained', 'evolving', 'perception', 'love', 'see', 'spectrum', 'as', 'diverse', 'special', 'effects', 'soundtrack', 'compliment', 'imagery.Using', 'younger', 'sister', 'rational', 'intellectual', 'source', 'advice', 'love', 'further', 'deconstruction', 'maturity', 'otherwise', 'might', 'serve', 'indication', 'education', 'subject', 'here', 'as', 'contrasting', 'editing', 'back', 'forth', 'Tom', 'utmost', 'happiness', 'bitter', 'despair', 'Summer', 'dude', 'looking', 'casual', 'no-pressure', 'romance', 'taking', 'role', 'stereotypical', 'uncaring', 'guy', 'not', 'relationship-demanding', 'over-affectionate', 'girl', 'grain', 'not', 'commonplace', 'Sid', 'not', 'Nancy', 'opposing', 'variances', 'romantic', 'dramedy', 'formula', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'fresh', 'different', 'entirely', 'worthwhile.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A
1242073,A2YW1TL9ZR3URI,B001UV4XUG,"The Mad Bostonian ""Steve""","[43, 46]","First off I must confess, I do not like Rom/coms, or Rom/Drams, I would much rather watch anything and I mean anything than these genres, I feel they are stupid, unbelievable, mostly appeal to the female audience who like the unrealistic happy endings and when the guy says sweet nothings in the girl's ear, gag me with a fork....BUT this movie is not your conventional Romantic Comedy, it's your unconventional, romantic comedy that actually keeps it real and tangible, sorry for all you ""The Note Book"" movie lovers out there who expect sweet, happy tearful endings.Plot is simple, boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl dumps boy; Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) is a Greeting card writer whose hidden talent is architecture, meets secretary Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and we go through his trials and tribulations to win her heart. He's the hopeless romantic, she is the free spirit, wanting to keep things casual, doesn't want to fall into the norms of a relationship. Where Tom questions this relationship, where she wants to keep it simple and not muddle things. So 500 Days of Summer chronicles the bittersweet beginnings, the sudden break up and all the crazy/ befuddled/ frustrating things that go on in between.Basically that is the plot, what works is how it is presented, we do not get a linear plot like all those other contrite unreal romantic comedies, what we get is a non linear plot that goes back and forth between Tom and Summer's relationship from the Highs to the Lows. This is refreshing. Where one scene after Tom spent the night with her we see him walk out of the building all smiles the next day (this is his High), as if he can take on the world, he is unstoppable, as if he is glowing, and through out the whole scene we see him do a dance number, shaking hands with people, strangers high fiving him, patting him on the back, he looks in a window and an image of Han Solo looks right back at him... showing him he is the epitome of cool,  (what makes it so real is who hasn't felt like that, after spending a night with the one they love, feeling great the next day)Then we see his Lows, his self loathing, his obsessing on why did they break up, that he thought for sure she was the one, it's gut wrenching real, because again we've been there and done that or had it done to us.They try to maintain a friendship, Summer invites him to a party and Tom accepts and what we get from this scene is so unique: Where Tom hopes the Universe will finally align itself and his expectations coincide with his reality. A split screen of Tom walking up the stairs to her Apartment, the caption on the Left reads, Expectations, caption on the right reads, Reality, again we as viewers can relate to this scene as it unfolds, Tom's expectations are he and Summer some how reconnect, he gives her a small gift in the form of a book, there's the catching of each others eyes; holding the gaze, the hug, the gentle touching, the laughing, shared moments by themselves, but then he and us viewers are thrust into the reality of the situation. There is no rekindling, she thanks him for the book, through out the party he feels like a stranger in a strange land and he leaves the party in disbelief, in agony, heart broken.... much like what would happen in real life, as we always run through our heads what we think will happen and think will be the perfect evening; finally going to tell her how you feel, you have that nice dinner planned, flowers, she'll be flattered and happy, and say she has the same feelings about you. Thinking it is bullet proof and then to have it all crashing down: either she says she doesn't feel the same way bout you, or she can't make that dinner date, or met someone else, etc etc etc, we so want those events to work and have it play over and over in our minds so the outcome is always positive that when the time comes does it rarely play to our expectations and we are thrust into cold reality. I just had to marvel at this particular scene because one it has happened to me numerous times and I am sure others could say the same thing, A brilliant scene indeed.What makes this work is the chemistry between Levitt and Deschanel, Levitt playing the forlorn, hopeless, romantic, nice guy, while Deschanel plays Summer as the care free, beautiful, sexy, men take a second glance at her kind of girl, this relationship works so harmoniously even through the tough parts of the break up, we as viewers can't  help but think that somehow they do stay together, that even I thought the typical Hollywood ending would come in and they get back together... but then it be classified as your conventional love story and that is not what the filmmakers and actors didn't want it to be, it's about that love is a cold hard bitch slap that we all have felt, which as I said earlier that we all can relate too.Kudos to the great writing, and chemistry between the actors, making something so real, and honest it's hard to do in Hollywood when everyone wants to see a Sandra Bullock Rom/Com. We all see a little Tom in us and we've all had that one Summer; I guess the message of the movie is people come into your lives for a reason, whether it be friends or the ""He's/ She's the one!"" moment and it turns out it's not, and that relationships come and go, new ones will be forged, and just hold onto the memories of the old ones no matter how good or bad they were, somehow they made you who you are now, I feel that how it was for Tom's case.A great movie I must say, worth checking out, what made it so real is because I think we've all been there and felt what Tom felt.",5,"she

All the muses must have been present when this film was written and conceived.

The sequencing of various memories out of order was mildly annoying, and it just wasn't catching my interest that much, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did not seem to fit the role I *thought* he was playing...However gradually it all began to mesh for me and by the end - and after the movie was over - I have decided that I liked it very much. I don't know that it would be for everyone, even those who like indie films, but as for me I really enjoyed it. It has been a couple of days since I saw it, and the afterthoughts linger nicely as very good films tend to do. It affected me, and connected with me through relationships from my own past. I've had my Days of Summer too.(500) Days of Summer explores a relationship, concepts about love and romance, the difference between fantasy and reality between friends and lovers, and of course the notion of unrequited love. The acting is very good, there are a lot of little coherent details and interesting scenes that add up to a rich film, and the story is universal. The climax is very poignant and intense, and so much went unsaid, which is a nice quality in a film.

It takes a whole lot for a movie to gain the honor of becoming a favorite movie in my eyes. I really liked how blunt and to the point this movie was. I also found it refreshing that it wasn't a love story at all throughout most of the movie. The main premise of the movie was the story of Tom Hansen and Summer Finn's relationship over the course of 500 days. I had not seen this movie in theatres prior to viewing it on DVD, so I had no idea what to expect. Until I started watching it, I was under the impression that the title of the movie referred to the season rather than an actual person. If you're looking for a good, romantic comedy, I'd say that this probably wouldn't be the best option for you to pick.

1242079,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B001UV4XUG,Traveler,"[9, 22]","""500 Days of Summer"" wants to be an indie style romantic comedy.  In many ways it succeeds.  The non-linear timeline for example.  And just the quirky story itself.  For these reasons and more I wanted to love this movie.  The problem is, ""500 Days"" runs smack right into the typical sexism we see in most regular romantic comedies - the B&W; male role who's either a total jerk or a saint who's just supposed to take whatever gets thrown his way and be charming just when he's supposed to be.A recent psychology article was published that theorized that modern romantic comedies were making relationships harder because, in the movies, the good guy always does the exact right thing just when it's wanted/required by the woman.  The argument was that women watching these movies were going to walk away with completely unrealistic expectations of what a relationship is like.  ""500 Days"" falls into this sexist trap.Zooey Deschanel, who typically only has two or three expressions in any film (her annoying ""look of amazement"" can be found in many of her movies), actually succeeds in this movie to present a real woman who's both super sexy and humanly flawed.  She's not the problem.  The problem is that her character is allowed to emotionally steamroll over Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who basically just sits there and takes it.  There's even a scene where Tom has a date with another woman who, after listening to Tom blubber on about how Summer hurt him, that it was all his fault because Summer had told him ""she wasn't looking for a relationship.""  All actions to the contrary, of course.In what rom-com would the female be polite and gracious when a male character has so obviously emotionally manipulated her (words not equaling their actions)?  I've watched a lot of these movies and I can't think of a one.  Cameron Diaz in ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" graciously puts up with the behavior of Julia Roberts.  Problem is, that's between two women, not the man.  The guy in that movie, like most rom-coms, plays it straight.  Perfectly acceptable, doesn't make waves.  There's also ""As Good As It Gets"" . . . accept Jack Nicholson's character is clearly mentally ill.  Not exactly a fair representation of your average guy.  Plus, there's that line from the movie: ""Why can't I have a normal boyfriend? Just a regular boyfriend, one that doesn't go nuts on me!"" with the response ""Everybody wants that, dear. It doesn't exist.""  Wonderful.For all its efforts to be different, ""500 Days"" is still just another romantic comedy that isn't emotionally fair to the male lead. It's as if male anger, justified anger no less, is not permissible.  This movie, like just about all rom-coms, panders to its female audience.  It gives the female character full permission to be a jerk and still likable while putting the guy in an emotional straitjacket lest he offend the audience because he dared to tell the woman what he really feels and thinks.  Genuine male feelings in American movies are rare to non-existent.This might be surprising given my critique, but I'll probably watch this movie again.  It's good.  But when it's over the obvious sexism will be the topic of discussion with whoever I'm with at the time.  And then I'll want to show them one of the rare films about relationships (although technically not a rom-com) that actually shows both the man and woman as flawed humans: ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""",3,A 5 star effort ruined by the usual rom-com sexism,1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,3432,"['500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'be', 'indie', 'style', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'many', 'ways', 'non-linear', 'timeline', 'example', 'just', 'quirky', 'story', 'reasons', 'more', 'wanted', 'love', 'movie', 'problem', '500', 'Days', 'smack', 'right', 'typical', 'sexism', 'see', 'most', 'regular', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'B', 'W', 'male', 'role', 'who', 'total', 'jerk', 'saint', 'who', 'just', 'supposed', 'take', 'thrown', 'way', 'be', 'charming', 'just', 'when', 'supposed', 'be.A', 'recent', 'psychology', 'article', 'was', 'published', 'theorized', 'modern', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'were', 'making', 'relationships', 'harder', 'because', 'movies', 'good', 'guy', 'always', 'exact', 'right', 'thing', 'just', 'when', 'wanted/required', 'woman', 'argument', 'was', 'women', 'watching', 'movies', 'were', 'going', 'walk', 'away', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'expectations', 'what', 'relationship', '500', 'Days', 'sexist', 'trap.Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'who', 'typically', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'expressions', 'film', 'annoying', 'look', 'amazement', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'many', 'movies', 'actually', 'movie', 'present', 'real', 'woman', 'who', 'super', 'sexy', 'humanly', 'flawed', 'not', 'problem', 'problem', 'character', 'allowed', 'emotionally', 'steamroll', 'over', 'Tom', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'who', 'basically', 'just', 'sits', 'there', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'Tom', 'date', 'woman', 'who', 'listening', 'Tom', 'blubber', 'how', 'Summer', 'hurt', 'was', 'fault', 'Summer', 'had', 'told', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'relationship', 'actions', 'contrary', 'course.In', 'what', 'rom-com', 'would', 'female', 'be', 'polite', 'gracious', 'when', 'male', 'character', 'so', 'obviously', 'emotionally', 'manipulated', 'words', 'not', 'equaling', 'actions', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'lot', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'graciously', 'up', 'behavior', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Problem', 'two', 'women', 'not', 'man', 'guy', 'movie', 'most', 'rom-coms', 'straight', 'Perfectly', 'acceptable', ""n't"", 'make', 'waves', 'also', 'As', 'Good', 'accept', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'clearly', 'mentally', 'ill.', 'Not', 'exactly', 'fair', 'representation', 'average', 'guy', 'line', 'movie', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'normal', 'boyfriend', 'Just', 'regular', 'boyfriend', 'one', ""n't"", 'go', 'nuts', 'response', 'Everybody', 'dear', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Wonderful.For', 'efforts', 'be', 'different', '500', 'Days', 'still', 'just', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'emotionally', 'fair', 'male', 'lead', 'male', 'anger', 'justified', 'anger', 'less', 'not', 'permissible', 'movie', 'just', 'rom-coms', 'panders', 'female', 'audience', 'female', 'character', 'full', 'permission', 'be', 'jerk', 'still', 'likable', 'putting', 'guy', 'emotional', 'straitjacket', 'lest', 'offend', 'audience', 'dared', 'tell', 'woman', 'what', 'really', 'feels', 'thinks', 'Genuine', 'male', 'feelings', 'American', 'movies', 'are', 'rare', 'non-existent.This', 'might', 'be', 'surprising', 'given', 'critique', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'good', 'when', 'obvious', 'sexism', 'will', 'be', 'topic', 'discussion', 'whoever', ""'m"", 'time', 'then', ""'ll"", 'want', 'show', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'relationships', 'technically', 'not', 'rom-com', 'actually', 'man', 'woman', 'flawed', 'humans', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind']",N/A

Off-beat boy-meets-girl story is told in a chronologically non-linear fashion slightly reminiscent of ""Annie Hall,"" and despite the narrator's disclaimer at the beginning (""You should know up front, this is not a love story""), you will share the romantic ups and downs with the young protagonist Tom.One thing unique about ""(500) days of Summer"" is that the bittersweet romantic tale is mostly told from a male's perspective. Director Marc Webb discards conventional narrative style of romantic comedy in favor of portraying motional turmoil of a young man terribly and utterly in love, using vignette like episodes. The film really works especially when it explores the way how men and women think differently. There are lots of things Tom must learn in these 500 days.Besides the non-linear narrative, ""(500) days of Summer"" employs many interesting narrative devices. There is a brief split-screen sequence, in which two different scenarios unfold simultaneously: one that Tom is dreaming of, and the other Tom really must face. This is so true, and saddening. Maybe the film is sometimes too quirky for its own good, overusing a variety of narrative techniques (including dancing sequence) that almost distance the viewer from the main characters, but Tom and Summer remain likable, two main characters we really care.Tom and Summer are played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. They both did a fantastic job, especially Zooey Deschanel. On screen she must look like a dream girl for Tom, and also a character with a touch of reality for us. Who wouldn't fall in love with her?

It is through this mundane job, however, that he meets Zooey Deschanel's character, the bewitching free spirit Summer Finn.  The ensuing events play out in way that is quite familiar from my days as a young single person.  Despite Summer's perennial denigration of the possibility that she would ever elect for a committed relationship, Tom continues to pursue her in hope that she might just be ""the one"" and come to think of him in the same way.  Over the course of 500 days, a sampling of which are played forwards and backwards in time, there are moments of joy and closeness interspersed with those filled with alienation and frustration--much like those found in actual relationships.The moments of drama in this film are tempered by a sort of retrospective provided towards the end of the story.  Weeks after they have gone their separate ways, the two have a heartfelt chat on a park bench.  The role of coincidence in meeting one's love is discussed--a thought that I have always found both wonderful and unnerving.  How one, especially a girl like Summer, finally knows that she has met the person with whom she wants a committed relationship is also explored--though, at the same time, the reasons and events behind her new feelings remain an impenetrable enigma.Unlike other romantic films, this movie is not so much about what true love is, but what it isn't.  The benefits of a failed or painfully ended relationship are, however, also revealed--and in a way that is not stupid or sappy.  Tom knows himself and his goals in life much better after the tutorial provided by Summer.  Perhaps for young people still ""out there"" and looking for love, this story might also suggest the need to look out for the literal events that mark the point where a relationship is exposed as intractable--and that it is time (or, more likely, way past time) to move on!",5,"True love, fate, the role of luck and coincidence, the tutorial provided by a failed relationship--and when to call it a day!",1338163200,"05 28, 2012",2012,1997,"['Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'role', 'Tom', 'Hansen', 'young', 'aspiring', 'architect', 'tied', 'mundane', 'job', 'greeting', 'card', 'company', 'mundane', 'job', 'however', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'character', 'bewitching', 'free', 'spirit', 'Summer', 'Finn', 'ensuing', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'way', 'quite', 'familiar', 'days', 'young', 'single', 'person', 'Summer', 'perennial', 'denigration', 'possibility', 'would', 'ever', 'elect', 'committed', 'relationship', 'Tom', 'pursue', 'hope', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'come', 'think', 'same', 'way', 'course', '500', 'days', 'sampling', 'are', 'played', 'forwards', 'backwards', 'time', 'are', 'moments', 'joy', 'closeness', 'interspersed', 'filled', 'alienation', 'frustration', 'much', 'found', 'actual', 'relationships.The', 'moments', 'drama', 'film', 'are', 'tempered', 'sort', 'retrospective', 'provided', 'end', 'story', 'have', 'gone', 'separate', 'ways', 'two', 'have', 'heartfelt', 'chat', 'park', 'bench', 'role', 'coincidence', 'meeting', 'one', 'love', 'discussed', 'thought', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'wonderful', 'unnerving', 'How', 'one', 'especially', 'girl', 'Summer', 'finally', 'met', 'person', 'whom', 'committed', 'relationship', 'also', 'explored', 'same', 'time', 'reasons', 'events', 'new', 'feelings', 'remain', 'impenetrable', 'enigma.Unlike', 'other', 'romantic', 'films', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'true', 'love', 'what', ""n't"", 'benefits', 'failed', 'painfully', 'ended', 'relationship', 'are', 'however', 'also', 'revealed', 'way', 'not', 'stupid', 'sappy', 'Tom', 'goals', 'life', 'much', 'better', 'tutorial', 'provided', 'Summer', 'Perhaps', 'young', 'people', 'still', 'there', 'looking', 'love', 'story', 'might', 'also', 'suggest', 'need', 'look', 'out', 'literal', 'events', 'mark', 'point', 'where', 'relationship', 'exposed', 'intractable', 'time', 'more', 'likely', 'way', 'time', 'move']",N/A

I have seen a great deal of romantic films, most of them involve a lot of adolescence and 80s new wave music. 500 Days of Summer, however is truly something special.What had me so taken by this movie was how relatable the movie was as a whole. It's the story of an average nice guy, who is smitten by a girl that is somewhat out of a dream to him. He is then taken on a mysterious journey into the mind of a woman who he is unsure of. It is a movie about trusting your instincts and while things are being shown to you in one way you have the ability to see them in a completely different one. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays one of his greatest rolls in this film as Tom. He is the guy that every average guy sees them self as. The guy who looks for the good in everything and does everything right in life to himself and to others and yet in the end gets the crap beaten out of him at the end all because he dared to dream. Zooey Deschanel plays an amazing role as Summer in this film. The girl who could be your girlfriend if you try hard enough and yet, she is the one that no one can read. When these two grade A personalities meet you get one of the greatest adventures you will ever experience in a movie.  The originality is also what drives this movie. It takes you all over a relationship but out of order. It is amazing to see the emotions that anyone can feel at various points in time. How they can go from walking on air to wanting to jump off a bridge and all the little junctures in between that got you from point A to B.Even if you have never seen or never enjoyed a romantic comedy in your lifetime, 500 Days of Summer is one you have to see.
