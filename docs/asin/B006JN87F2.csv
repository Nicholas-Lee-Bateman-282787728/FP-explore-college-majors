I didn't know what to tell them so I played it for them that evening instead. What I learned while watching ""The Woodcarver"" is that the devotional film genre of movies is far from gone. Though other movies of this genre are certainly few, there are still good stories and excellent values to be had, courtesy of Faith & Family films.I won't ruin anything but I loved how two trouble souls helped each other in a way no one else could have. As unlikely as the help they channeled from one another was, it was full-circle. It is said that faith in god works the same way. This movie incorporates that idea and relates it through a believable story, commendable acting, and a heartwarming ending that, though convenient, begs to seen again.As I said before, you don't see many movies like this anymore. Wouldn't it be a shame not to share a film like this with your children and family every once in a while? The kids; they've already seen lying, stealing, cursing, manipulating, and violence. It is all over the place, especially advertisements and, more shockingly, their own programs and cartoons. Let them see something that teaches them that the power of love has the strength to conquer all of the troubles that lie in their way.I had a healthy dose of films very similar to this one when I was a child. In hindsight, it seems like there were more of them then. I believe that my values were helped in a positive way by the messages that I was delivered from films such as this.",5,A Good Message To Be Learned From This Movie,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,1556,"['woodcarver', 'arrived', 'home', 'kids', 'asked', 'what', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'tell', 'so', 'played', 'evening', 'instead', 'What', 'learned', 'watching', 'Woodcarver', 'devotional', 'film', 'genre', 'movies', 'far', 'gone', 'other', 'movies', 'genre', 'are', 'certainly', 'few', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'stories', 'excellent', 'values', 'be', 'had', 'courtesy', 'Faith', 'Family', 'films.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'anything', 'loved', 'how', 'two', 'trouble', 'souls', 'helped', 'other', 'way', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'As', 'unlikely', 'help', 'channeled', 'one', 'was', 'was', 'full-circle', 'said', 'faith', 'god', 'same', 'way', 'movie', 'idea', 'believable', 'story', 'commendable', 'acting', 'heartwarming', 'ending', 'convenient', 'begs', 'seen', 'again.As', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'movies', 'anymore', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'shame', 'not', 'share', 'film', 'children', 'family', 'once', 'while', 'kids', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'lying', 'stealing', 'cursing', 'manipulating', 'violence', 'place', 'especially', 'advertisements', 'more', 'shockingly', 'own', 'programs', 'cartoons', 'Let', 'see', 'something', 'power', 'love', 'strength', 'conquer', 'troubles', 'lie', 'way.I', 'had', 'healthy', 'dose', 'films', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'hindsight', 'were', 'more', 'then', 'believe', 'values', 'were', 'helped', 'positive', 'way', 'messages', 'was', 'delivered', 'films', 'such']",WWJD II: The Woodcarver

When their lives get too busy for each other and God, Jack and Rita only argue whenever they are together. His parents marriage fell apart, so teenaged son Matthew prays. When God doesn't appear to answer, Matthew reacts with rebellion and vandalizes the church. The pastor and deacons choose not to press charges, if Matthew is made to help repair the damages. An unlikely friendship develops between Matthew and Ernest Otto the man who did the original wood carvings. After Mattie quits school and threatens to run away from home, his parents reluctantly allow him to stay with Mr. Otto to defuse the growing resentment the boy has toward everyone. Mr. Otto challenges Matthew to think about each decision he makes by first asking himself, ""What would Jesus do?""This is a good film for family viewing or for youth groups. Many kids have to deal with disappointments, divorce, changes, and obstacles that cause them to want to lash out in anger. Learning that Jesus and the Bible are not outmoded, but relevant for today is a lesson well worth repeating. Romans 12:2 tells us, ""Don't become like the people of this world. Instead, change the way you think. Then you will always be able to determine what God really wants--what is good, pleasing, and perfect."" (God's Word translation).

I watched this movie on television recently and was quite moved by it. While the story line is different, it's as if ""The Last Brickmaker in America"" is a cookie cutter and they fit the woodcarver into the same mold.  Having seen that fine film at least a dozen times, I could anticipate what was going to happen in this one in a couple of places.  No matter, it is so touching that I didn't care.The story is about a troubled teen Matthew Stevenson (played by Dakota Daulby) who acts out his frustration in a destructive manner by destroying some church property and damages some intricate woodwork formed by a master craftsman Ernest Otto (played by John Ratzenberger).  John plays the part of Mr. Otto so well.  He is soft spoken but his words resonate with those he talks to.  The boy ends up working with Mr. Otto to help repair the damage he did.  They quickly become friends and the boys attitude begins to change in a positive way.  His father (played by Woody Jeffreys) really objects to his son helping Mr. Otto despite it being a punishment, as Mr. Otto is his competition so to speak in the construction business.  Woody turns in a masterful performance as the boy's father.I don't want to ruin the outcome, but I will say this, I don't think you could watch this movie from beginning to end and not be affected by it for the better.  Whether or not you ascribe to the principles taught here, they will still ring true and stay with you for several days afterwards.  If you haven't seen it, I can't recommend it highly enough.

It is rated PG for vandalism at the opening, and arson near the middle. This is a story of restoration of a family and return to faith in belief in each other and in God. It is very well written and demonstrates reaching out to others to draw them in to find themselves within the perils of their lives.We liked this movie because it is fast moving bringing you alongside the action of every day life choices that either bring us closer or divide us.The Woodcarver Official Movie Trailer DVD [...]Matthew Stevenson is a troubled kid from a broken home. When he vandalizes the local church to get back at his parents, Matthew has to repair the damage to the church to avoid criminal charges. While working at the church, he meets Ernest (John Ratzenberger), an accomplished wood carver who created the intricate woodwork decoration that Matthew destroyed. Ernest has become something of a hermit, but reluctantly comes out of reclusion to help repair the church. Now Ernest and Matthew must work together to preserve the church's beautiful antiquity, and along the way, they also manage to restore their faith in God and in life. Run Time: 91 minutes.

His home life is falling apart because of his parents separation and obvious distain for each other. It was hard to watch how his parents treated each other in that scene at the church, the morning after the vandalism.But as the story progresses, through the influence of one man who uses a simple question--What Would Jesus Do--to look at life and all of its problems, Matthew begins to change. And not only him...but his parents as well.The acting, in parts, seemed a bit unnatural (especially the father, in my opinion). But, overall, it was well done. Matthew played the part as trouble teenager well! The story plot, also, kept moving at a good pace and, towards the end, I wasn't sure what was going to happen--and was surprised at the small twist it took.

He has quit school, is withdrawn, and has destroyed church property.  Ernest is a man who is still reeling from his own loss.  Matthew destroyed much of what Ernest built for the church and has started working with Ernest to fix the damages on the outside of the building and the inside of his heart.The story is done quite well with really excellent acting on all sides.  From the beginning opening music to the flow of the story, I was drawn in. Sometimes a faith based film can seem rather cheaply done, poorly written or badly acted.  That was entirely not the case for this film.  Ernest and Matthew develop a bond immediately, and the older man helps the teen deal with the pain from his broken home and the teen and his family show the elder wood carver that God indeed has a purpose even now for his life even without his bride by his side.I would strongly recommend this film for any family member.  There is a great message.  It is appropriate for all ages, but in my opinion I would probably look at the age to start at around 8 or 9.  This is a good time for them to get a message of deciding what Jesus would do in their own circumstances.

With this simple question, 'Ernest' reaches out to the teenager who destroyed his beautiful carvings and even Matthew's parents.

Matthew feels tossed between his parents as they continue with their plans for a divorce. His dad is a workaholic who seems to have little time for his family. His mom, in her anger and frustration, isn't emotionally available to her son. The only time Matthew sees his parents together is when they're fighting - many times about him. As an act of seeking attention, Matthew vandalizes the church. After all, isn't it God's fault that his parents are seeking a divorce? Isn't it God's fault that Matthew feels unloved?Woodcarver Ernest Otto's wife recently died of cancer. He struggles with overcoming her death and the life they once shared. Deep in his grief, he finds it difficult to continue without the woman with whom he shared so many years of his life. It doesn't help that the ornate woodcarving he did for the church many years ago has been destroyed by vandalism.Before long, Matthew's and Ernest's lives intersect. Together, they set out to repair the damage done by Matthew, and Ernest provides the fatherly role model for Matthew that he has long yearned for. In the process, Ernest teaches Matthew something very important. What if, in every dealing that we have with others, we ask ourselves the question, ""What would Jesus do?"" This simple, yet profound question changes Matthew's outlook and perspective.What happens when Matthew's dad discovers Matthew has been spending time with the elderly woodcarver? What happens when a fire destroys the hard work Matthew and Ernest have accomplished? Is it possible that God has plans for us even when we think our lives are lacking purpose? Is forgiveness possible, even in difficult situations?This is a great family film that approaches the topic of treating others as Jesus would treat them and becoming more and more Christlike in our everyday dealings with others.  It also focuses on forgiveness, grace, and the importance of marriage. I have seen The Last Bricklayer, and I enjoyed that movie very much - and yes, this movie is similar. However, The Woodcarver adds elements of faith-based answers to life's problems.This movie had no objectionable material, with the exception of an utterance of the Lord's name in vain. In my opinion, this never adds to a movie, only detracts from it. Little ones may be frightened by the brief vandalism scene and a brief fire scene (these are both tastefully done).

He is ordered by the church deacons to spend his time repairing all the damage he did to avoid persecution. However a lot of the wood work that is destroyed was created by Ernest Otto (John Ratzenberger).Since losing his wife of forty years to cancer, Ernest has lived a reclusive life and his woodcarving tools have sat unused since his creations at the church many years ago. Now called by the church once more to restore some of the unique carvings to the church, Ernest enlists the aid of Matthew to help him finish on time, otherwise the work will be bid out to competitor wood mill whom his father is forming a partnership with.Feeling that God doesn't answer prayers, Matthew confesses to Ernest that he prayed for his parents to avoid getting divorced and now fighting and living separate lives, he believes that God has failed him. Yet because God answers prayers in unique and different ways from what we expect, this family will find that anything is possible if one is willing to work hard at it and offer their prayers to God.I received the DVD, The Woodcarver, compliments of Propeller and Nasser Group North for my honest review and thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful family film. It shows that we need to enjoy what we have in the present more so than ever before because even the prayers we ask, may often times be answered by God in far different ways than we ever imagined. Our family really enjoyed the message of this movie and found it a great way to talk about prayer and how God will often times answer them. While the answers may be different than we expected, it does not mean God doesn't listen or doesn't care.
