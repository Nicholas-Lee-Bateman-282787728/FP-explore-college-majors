1079550,A109WIE49N0GV,B000R7HRRA,DVD buff,"[5, 6]","Every couple of years, a TV show comes along that really stands out.  Once a decade or so, you get a show that literally takes your breath away with its brilliance.  BROTHERS AND SISTERS is one such show.Let's start with the cast -- this is the most perfectly-cast show to come along in years.  Every single character is played intelligently, realistically, and with great depth, and the actors and the chemistry between them are a large part of that.  Sally Field is immensely deserving of her Emmy, but Rachel Griffiths and Calista Flockhart are also equally as deserving of recognition.Then there's the production of the show.  This show is beautiful to watch, especially in high-definition (where's the Blu-Ray version??).  Dirction, lighting, cinematography and set design are simply the best there is on TV these days.  The visual richness of the show only makes it that much more fun to watch.And of course, there's the writing.  None of this would be possible without excellent stories and good dialogue.  The blend of comedy and drama, done so well by shows like BOSTON LEGAL and DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, is taken to a new level, with more laugh-out-loud moments than most sitcoms, and more genuine tears (of both joy and sadness) than many ""Best Picture""-winning movies.  There aren't many shows that I can count on to make me cry every week, but BROTHERS AND SISTERS manages to bring tears to my eyes at least once every week.What pushes BROTHERS AND SISTERS into the category of truly brilliant television is the way it is pushing the envelope of what we see on network television.  I sometimes find myself checking to make sure I'm not watching HBO or Showtime, where ground-breaking television has become the norm.  We have the first totally real gay character on network television -- one who has a real love life and will actually passionately kiss guys in prime time.  We have married couples with extremely realistic relationships.  We have non-stereotypical takes on drug addiction, infidelity, grief.I could go on, but I suspect if you've read this far you get the point -- if you were to only watch one show on TV (or buy one TV-on-DVD set), this should be the one.A note on the DVD:  It's rare that a DVD season set includes an extra as good as the one contained here -- a complete, previously-unaired episode.  It was meant to be the second episode of the season, but apparently the producers felt it didn't move the story in the direction they wanted to go.  While it isn't the best episode of the series, it is certainly fantastic to watch, especially for someone like me who has seen every episode at least twice already.  Many DVD sets have ""special"" episodes included, but they're usually either recaps of the the season, or just short episodes (like the ""extra"" episodes they've been including on the 24 season sets the past few years).  This extra episode of BROTHERS AND SISTERS is a complete, finished, full-length episode.For the die-hard fans:  If you buy the set at Target, you get a bonus DVD containing a Museum of Radio and Television interview with the cast.  It's not particularly exciting, but the hardcore fans will want to see it.",5,Truly brilliant television,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,3170,"['couple', 'years', 'TV', 'show', 'really', 'out', 'Once', 'decade', 'so', 'get', 'show', 'literally', 'breath', 'away', 'brilliance', 'BROTHERS', 'SISTERS', 'one', 'such', 'show.Let', 'start', 'cast', 'most', 'perfectly-cast', 'show', 'come', 'along', 'years', 'single', 'character', 'played', 'intelligently', 'realistically', 'great', 'depth', 'actors', 'chemistry', 'are', 'large', 'part', 'Sally', 'Field', 'immensely', 'deserving', 'Emmy', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'Calista', 'Flockhart', 'are', 'also', 'equally', 'deserving', 'recognition.Then', 'production', 'show', 'show', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'especially', 'high-definition', 'where', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'Dirction', 'lighting', 'cinematography', 'set', 'design', 'are', 'simply', 'best', 'TV', 'days', 'visual', 'richness', 'show', 'only', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'watch.And', 'course', 'writing', 'None', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'excellent', 'stories', 'good', 'dialogue', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'shows', 'BOSTON', 'LEGAL', 'DESPERATE', 'HOUSEWIVES', 'taken', 'new', 'level', 'more', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'most', 'sitcoms', 'more', 'genuine', 'tears', 'joy', 'sadness', 'many', 'Best', 'Picture', '-winning', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'shows', 'can', 'count', 'make', 'cry', 'week', 'BROTHERS', 'AND', 'SISTERS', 'manages', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'least', 'once', 'week.What', 'BROTHERS', 'AND', 'SISTERS', 'category', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'television', 'way', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'what', 'see', 'network', 'television', 'sometimes', 'find', 'checking', 'make', 'sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'watching', 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'where', 'ground-breaking', 'television', 'become', 'norm', 'have', 'first', 'totally', 'real', 'gay', 'character', 'network', 'television', 'one', 'who', 'real', 'love', 'life', 'will', 'actually', 'passionately', 'kiss', 'guys', 'prime', 'time', 'have', 'married', 'couples', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'relationships', 'have', 'non-stereotypical', 'drug', 'addiction', 'infidelity', 'grief.I', 'could', 'go', 'suspect', ""'ve"", 'read', 'far', 'get', 'point', 'were', 'only', 'watch', 'one', 'show', 'TV', 'buy', 'one', 'TV-on-DVD', 'set', 'should', 'be', 'one.A', 'note', 'DVD', 'rare', 'DVD', 'season', 'set', 'extra', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'contained', 'here', 'complete', 'previously-unaired', 'episode', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'second', 'episode', 'season', 'apparently', 'producers', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'story', 'direction', 'wanted', 'go', ""n't"", 'best', 'episode', 'series', 'certainly', 'fantastic', 'watch', 'especially', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'episode', 'least', 'twice', 'already', 'Many', 'DVD', 'sets', 'have', 'special', 'episodes', 'included', ""'re"", 'usually', 'recaps', 'season', 'just', 'short', 'episodes', 'extra', ""'ve"", 'been', 'including', '24', 'season', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'extra', 'episode', 'BROTHERS', 'AND', 'SISTERS', 'complete', 'finished', 'full-length', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'buy', 'set', 'Target', 'get', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'containing', 'Museum', 'Radio', 'Television', 'interview', 'cast', 'not', 'particularly', 'exciting', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'see']",N/A

However, it was a love at first sight and after two episodes I ordered the two available seasons (and bought the third since) and then... spent almost two weeks watching four episodes per evening...This is a crazy modern family - well-off enough to make the viewing interesting but down-to-earth to make the viewer share at least some of the problems. Not another Dynasty by any chance. The list of characters (and the cast which is superb!) offers an impressive array of human types - a working mom, a right-wing TV/radio journalist, a gay lawyer, a vineyard owner, a Afghanistan/Iraq veteran plus an even more varied group of people they love, hate, quarrel with etc.The show can get cheesy at times but only within the range of human experience, and it's very funny most of the time. The acting is top class (does the name of Sally Fields rings any bell? Once the mother of Forrest Gump now she is the mother of - almost - all Walkers) and the casting absolutely perfect. Plus guest stars - but I won't reveal any details.Ladies and gentlemen - if you haven't met the Walkers, it's high time you did.

The ""mysteries"" are cliches (the father who had a 'secret' affair; the family business is a 'secret' financial disaster about to unravel; the weak, tragic post-war son (completely unconvincing, going from party boy to depressed, neurotic brat in seconds) is a disaster waiting to happen; the mother 'secret'-ly knew about the affair).  For one thing, Calista, Rachel, Patricia and Sally all look the same age (thanks the miracles of Botox and liposuction).  And ALL the male characters actually DO look exactly the same, except for Rachel's cutely-disheveled husband. Yawn.  And what's with the gay lawyer son? He has two facial expressions.

I didn't really know much about the other actors except for Calista Flockhart (from Ally McBeal fame) and Tom Skirrit (who is only in the pilot and then featured in a few other episodes).  They all do a fabulous job if you ask me.The show is basically centered around the Walker family with Sally Field playing the matriarch Nora Walker.  Then you have her two daughters, Kitty (Flockhart) and Sarah (Griffiths) and her three sons, Tommy (Balthazar Getty), Kevin (Matthew Rhys) and Justin (Dave Annable).  Of course, each family member has his or her share of problems, just like any family.  Patricia Wettig is also a part of the ensemble, portraying Holly Harper the woman who probably has the biggest secret of all...and she isn't even related to the family...not biologically anyway.  Emily VanCamp joined the show later in the season, playing a mysterious character, Rebecca...all we knew from the beginning was that she was Holly's daughter.  And then you have Rob Lowe who also joined mid-season playing Republican Senator Robert McCallister which is kind of ironic because when he was on The West Wing, he played a Democrat who basically despised the Republicans.  Nice change of pace for him though.All in all, this is a great new series from ABC.  I like the fact that it follows my other favorite show Desperate Housewives.

1079562,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B000R7HRRA,Marc Cabir Davis,"[4, 4]","Its hard to think of a show that can take the place of ""Six Feet Under"" (honestly, I don't think any show could ever do that), but ""Brothers and Sisters"" is the closest thing to that show that's currently on TV. The magic of `Six Feet Under' was its darkness and gloom, yet its tongue in cheek and realistic portrayal of day to day life and relationships, without ever getting too campy or pretentious for its' own good. `Brothers and Sisters' is perhaps a poorer cousin to that show, as the Season Premiere itself was a flamboyant camp-fest with some over the top performances and one-liners. And still, in spirit, its very, very close to the essence of the relationships that we saw on `Six Feet Under', which is why I am so interested in this series currently.The always good Calista Flockhart is given a very interesting role here, and for once has to rely on her acting chops rather than her pixie-like good looks. It was evident that she has aged here - upon first viewing I was shocked at the lines on her face and wondered `Has it been THAT long since Ally?', but no matter - her age, her looks, and her performance are all so apt for the role shes playing here - in fact, at times I thought that no other actress could possibly play her role - its pitch perfect. Sally Field, I'm not so crazy about. I have never been a huge fan of her, and even though I see so many glowing reviews for her performance on this show, I felt it was the most `staged' and `forced'. It was as if Sally couldn't quite get under the skin of her character, which is sad considering shes supposed to be the glue that holds the show together. For that reason, this still remains `that new Calista Flockhart show', but I'm not complaining.Fans of the 1980s teen idol Paul Balthazar Getty (""Lord of the Flies"" - he now calls himself just Balthazar Getty) are in for a treat as the 34 year old actor finds the perfect vehicle for his striking screen presence and his underutilized acting abilities. Of everyone in the star cast, I think he has the most potential. Matthew Rhys plays the token `gay brother', but in a surprising twist, they make him human and likable, and fraught with his own neuroses. His love interest, played by Wentworth Millers' real-life partner Luke McFarlane, is also exceptional and deserves special credit for stealing literally every scene he is in. This is the only actor on TV right now (other than `Ugly Betty''s Mark Indelicato) who manages to draw 100% audience attention to himself everytime he is on screen.Mention should also be made of the luminous and exceptional Rachel Griffith (ironically a SFU alumnus), who has perfected an American accent to such a degree that its impossible to tell that the actor isn't actually American or Canadian. Apart from South Africa's Charlize Theron, I can't think of anyone who does such a good job with a regional American accent.Think of this as a Danielle Steel novel come to life, and you won't be much off the mark. In this case, this is a good thing. Its at times a little too overwrought for its' own good, but I can't say that this works against it. In fact, the more melodramatic scenes and the more contrived plot lines are carried out with so much conviction that you can't help but buy into it. Make no mistake though - even though this is advertised as a serious family drama, the main storyline focuses on the troubled relationship between mother and daughter. This is NOT the `Gilmore Girls', so right off the bat we are in darker, and more murky territory.Special attention should be paid to the stellar script. The biting one liners only got better as the show progressed. Again, not as witty or pointed as the dialog on `Ugly Betty', but the show does have its `bitchy' moments. Yes, it has a lot in common with many other shows of the same genre over the years (`Everwood', `Family', `Once and Again'), but because of the powerhouse star cast and good writing, this show rises from ordinary and becomes something special. Relive the magical first season on DVD - in fact, you'll probably start playing episode after episode and get totally hooked once you start it!Four Stars, because as always, this could have been better.",4,"A Semi-Worthy Successor to ""Six Feet Under""",1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,4197,"['hard', 'think', 'show', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'Six', 'Feet', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'show', 'could', 'ever', 'do', 'Brothers', 'Sisters', 'closest', 'thing', 'show', 'currently', 'TV', 'magic', 'Six', 'Feet', 'was', 'darkness', 'gloom', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'day', 'day', 'life', 'relationships', 'ever', 'getting', 'too', 'campy', 'pretentious', 'own', 'good', 'Brothers', 'Sisters', 'perhaps', 'poorer', 'cousin', 'show', 'Season', 'Premiere', 'was', 'flamboyant', 'camp-fest', 'top', 'performances', 'one-liners', 'still', 'spirit', 'very', 'very', 'close', 'essence', 'relationships', 'saw', 'Six', 'Feet', 'why', 'am', 'so', 'interested', 'series', 'currently.The', 'always', 'good', 'Calista', 'Flockhart', 'given', 'very', 'interesting', 'role', 'here', 'once', 'rely', 'acting', 'chops', 'rather', 'pixie-like', 'good', 'looks', 'was', 'evident', 'aged', 'here', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'shocked', 'lines', 'face', 'wondered', 'been', 'THAT', 'long', 'Ally', 'matter', 'age', 'performance', 'are', 'so', 'apt', 'role', 'shes', 'playing', 'here', 'fact', 'times', 'thought', 'other', 'actress', 'could', 'possibly', 'play', 'role', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Sally', 'Field', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'crazy', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'even', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'performance', 'show', 'felt', 'was', 'most', 'staged', 'forced', 'was', 'Sally', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'skin', 'character', 'sad', 'considering', 'shes', 'supposed', 'be', 'glue', 'show', 'together', 'reason', 'still', 'new', 'Calista', 'Flockhart', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining.Fans', '1980s', 'teen', 'idol', 'Paul', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'now', 'just', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'are', 'treat', '34', 'year', 'old', 'actor', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'striking', 'screen', 'presence', 'underutilized', 'acting', 'abilities', 'everyone', 'star', 'cast', 'think', 'most', 'potential', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'token', 'gay', 'brother', 'surprising', 'twist', 'make', 'human', 'likable', 'fraught', 'own', 'neuroses', 'love', 'interest', 'played', 'Wentworth', 'Millers', 'real-life', 'partner', 'Luke', 'McFarlane', 'also', 'exceptional', 'special', 'credit', 'stealing', 'literally', 'scene', 'only', 'actor', 'TV', 'right', 'now', 'other', 'Ugly', 'Betty', 's', 'Mark', 'Indelicato', 'who', 'draw', '100', '%', 'audience', 'attention', 'everytime', 'screen.Mention', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'luminous', 'exceptional', 'Rachel', 'Griffith', 'ironically', 'SFU', 'alumnus', 'who', 'perfected', 'American', 'accent', 'degree', 'impossible', 'tell', 'actor', ""n't"", 'actually', 'American', 'Canadian', 'Apart', 'South', 'Africa', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'job', 'regional', 'American', 'accent.Think', 'Danielle', 'Steel', 'novel', 'come', 'life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'mark', 'case', 'good', 'thing', 'times', 'little', 'too', 'overwrought', 'own', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'fact', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'scenes', 'more', 'contrived', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'carried', 'so', 'much', 'conviction', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'buy', 'Make', 'mistake', 'even', 'advertised', 'serious', 'family', 'drama', 'main', 'storyline', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'mother', 'daughter', 'NOT', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'so', 'right', 'bat', 'are', 'darker', 'more', 'murky', 'territory.Special', 'attention', 'should', 'be', 'paid', 'stellar', 'script', 'biting', 'one', 'only', 'got', 'better', 'show', 'progressed', 'Again', 'not', 'witty', 'pointed', 'dialog', 'Ugly', 'Betty', 'show', 'have', 'bitchy', 'moments', 'Yes', 'lot', 'common', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'same', 'genre', 'years', 'Everwood', 'Family', 'Once', 'Again', 'powerhouse', 'star', 'cast', 'good', 'writing', 'show', 'ordinary', 'something', 'special', 'Relive', 'magical', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'start', 'playing', 'episode', 'episode', 'get', 'totally', 'hooked', 'once', 'start', 'Four', 'Stars', 'always', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better']",N/A

Though not viewed as being in the same class as the best productions on TV like FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, THE WIRE, LOST, and THE SHIELD, it had clearly created a place for it as a well regarded family drama.I have just finished watching all of Seasons One and Two of the show.  I have the first episode of Season 3 DVR'd and after watching that I'll be ready to start watching it live next Sunday.  I very much enjoy the characters on the show and largely watch the series for that reason.  I'm not certain that the overarching series narrative is as good as the group of characters that they have assembled.  I've been put off by a relative timidity in the story telling.  So far the show bears a strong resemblance to a high class soap opera.  A highly regarded critical study of soap operas bears the title STORIES WITHOUT END.  I find that applies to BROTHERS AND SISTERS.  The stories here never end, but they never really go anywhere substantial.  Contrast that to the series on which Marti Noxon previously worked:  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  That landmark series featured a number of stories that had ends, as well as beginnings and middles.  Things happen on BROTHERS AND SISTERS, and there are a host of mini story arcs, but as a whole the show is not characterized by a number of master narratives that frame and carry the series forward.  Contrast this with another show by show runner Greg Berlanti, ELI STONE.  One of the joys of that show is following the central story of whether Eli is a modern day prophet or whether he is merely plagued by visions caused by his brain aneurysm.  The closest to a master narrative on BROTHERS AND SISTERS is:  siblings and parents strive to get along while keeping and revealing family secrets.  As a result, the show sometimes just feels like a superior reality show.What makes what is overall a fairly limited concept work so well is a great and talented cast.  The cast is filled with both Hollywood veterans and newcomers, with both American and superb imported actors.  In one of the major recastings, Sally Field took over as the matron of the Walker clan (interestingly, she and Tom Skerritt, who died in the first episode, played a married couple in STEEL MAGNOLIAS).  Frankly, she didn't seem right to me at first.  I felt that she had a tiny bit of trouble finding her character, though with the reputed chaos onset in the beginning that might not be surprising.  I loved Calista Flockhart on ALLY MCBEAL and was initially excited about her return to TV, but I found (and still find) her role as a right wing journalist off-putting.  To be honest, neither she nor her future boss/love interest Rob Lowe make especially convincing right wingers.  They seem like everyday folk with tags and labels tacked onto them every once and a while.  Lowe will make a quip about school vouchers to give some superficial credibility to his being a conservative, but neither the leftists nor the leftists on the show seem convincingly political.  It is more like window dressing than anything.  I've always liked Rachel Griffiths.  I originally saw her in several British productions where she spoke with her natural accent and then loved her on SIX FEET UNDER where she affected an American accent.  That role makes her very easy to accept on BROTHERS AND SISTERS as an American.  I was previously unfamiliar with the world of Welshman Matthew Rhys, but he sports a perfect American accent, as does Aussie John Pyper-Ferguson, who I previously knew only from an unsympathetic character on my favorite current show, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (he played the CAG from Pegasus who pulled a gun on Apollo while they both sat in their Raptor).  I enjoy both Ron Rifkin and Balthazar Getty (who had both been on ALIAS -- it took me a long, long time to stop seeing Rifkin as Arvin Sloane, which I eventually did, though I got a huge blast out of the guest appearance of Joel Grey at the end of Season One, who memorably portrayed ""the Other Arvin Sloane"" on the series).  Although I didn't initially care for Dave Annable as the youngest Walker sibling, Justin, he eventually became one of my favorite characters.  I like Sarah Jane Morris, who I remembered from FECLITY, but she really hasn't been given much of a chance to shine on the show.  Part of my enjoyment of the show has been limited by two actors I have never really enjoyed:  Rob Lowe (I disliked him in the early eighties and I still dislike him now) and Patricia Wettig (another ALIAS veteran -- her husband Ken Olin was a producer on both shows).  Late in the season one of the more interesting additions to the series was made with the debut of a new half-sister to the Walkers, Rebecca, played by the impossibly cute Emily Van Camp.On the micro level this is a very good show.  On the macro level I am still not sure it is really going anywhere.  As an unambitious, ""small"" show I enjoy it a great deal.  And I definitely plan on sticking with it.  I just wish that they were a bit bolder in their storytelling.  Many of the creative staff worked on both FELICITY and ALIAS, but so far they've demonstrated little of the boldness found on both of those shows.  Still, sometimes a pleasant show involving likable, interesting characters is enough.  As long as you don't think about how much more it could be.",4,A thoroughly enjoyable family drama,1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,5873,"['have', 'come', 'BROTHERS', 'AND', 'SISTERS', 'somewhat', 'late',

We have some brilliant actors, especially Sally Field, Matthew Rhys (a Welshman) and Rachel Griffiths (an Aussie).  We have some so-so actors, including the formerly wonderful Patricia Wettig, who is at sea here, and the one-note (anyone for Ally McBeal?) Calista Flockhart.  Truly the worst story-line of the season has been devoted to her returning to the Walker abode, her career, her love life.  Good actors are better when playing up against better actors; bad actors only advertise how bad they are when in a scene with actors who truly shine.  We definitely have some bad actors attached to this show, and the unevenness lowers the calibre all on its own, separate from the writing issues.  Also, we had sharply written characters in the first episodes, then the series declined in quality, even becoming burlesque (that ridiculous nonsensical McCallister extended family at the engagement party) towards the end.  In-between some true highlights, such as the infamous GAME NIGHT episode: Especially memorable is the cut-throat fury of the Walkers competing against their foes; the dinosaur impression by ""Kevin""; and ""Kevin's"" introduction earlier that day to ""Jason McCallister"" - supposedly the new love interest.  Not enough time given to ""Kevin"" and ""Jason,"" surprisingly, considering how important the relationship is supposed to be, but time spent on a ridiculous ""Kitty"" kissing the senator in front of the rival family - not even worthy of an old hollywood grade Z film.  In the meantime, you have a boring married couple (the eldest Walker son); a couple whose marriage is collapsing (the eldest Walker sibling); the youngest Walker sibling going thru dependency issues and then being sent off to Iraq.  This would be more effective if a good actor were playing the part. Actually, the joke on one on-line community is the actor playing ""Justin"" makes Rob Lowe ""the senator"" look good in comparison.  The show doesn't seem to have a clear direction; whether to be profound or over-the-top like DYNASTY.  It might be better - unless you're in love with one of the characters/actors - to consider skipping the boxed set in favor of individual episodes to add to your collection.

They all scattered throughout the whole series making it a very unbalance show. However, ABC managed to pull through it with a safety net for the first season, but then they will really need to fix up a lot of flaws before they air it again.First of all, you have Sally Field, Matthew Rhys, Rachel Griffiths and Patricia Wettig, so it is a cast that you really look forward to. Calister Flockhart...hm...well...she is just Ally in Kitty disguise, though she has some of the best characterisation written for her. But her circus of relationship just didn't work. Rachel Griffiths is still great but under utilised. After 5 whole seasons of Six Feet Under, I don't think people who love her performance will be settled for this. Her marriage coverage is not really in depth and thus all her family drama became very trivial as compared to the big picture. Sally Field is funny and annoying at the same time but that's how well she did her work. Matthew Rhys is great and well done though his relationship with Jason Lewis is a bit disappointing, as you thought they will have a bigger coverage. But Matthew Rhys is just funny and interesting to watch. Patricia Wettig...well not as good as I thought but still watchable.The problem is with this bunch of great actors, you really need other good actors to support them. Why is it that the people who are playing Justin and Tommy were chosen to be in the show is a mystery. They are so bad as compared to the rest of the cast. Wooden acting and bad story lines. The so called drama just keeps you on the nerve. And their characters are just boring. They will be two major problem that could kill the show in the following season because you just can't think of anything interesting to be written for actors who can't really act. Boring actors for boring characters mean switching channels.Storywise, they have good episodes and bad episodes. So when you watch the show you just feel like you a strolling through a rocky outback bush area. Certain parts are really cliche and disappointing. When those storylines come up you just feel like ""come on, can we have something else?"" I think Sally Fields' storyline was great. Rachel Griffith's storyline was great in the first half. Matthew Rhys' storyline was great in the second half. But then you can't think of other memorable storylines at all. But the good thing is most of the funny parts are funny and the whole passive aggressiveness in the family are just like wonders. It really makes you feel what would you do if you are stuck in those situation with them.Overall speaking. Season One is above average but there are a lot to fix if ABC wants season two to be great too. And I think most audience will expect a much better Season Two before they switch off the TV or change channel.",4,Feels like strolling through a rocky landscape,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,2863,"['Brothers', 'Sisters', 'have', 'best', 'worst', 'show', 'scattered', 'whole', 'series', 'making', 'very', 'unbalance', 'show', 'However', 'ABC', 'managed', 'pull', 'safety', 'net', 'first', 'season', 'then', 'will', 'really', 'need', 'fix', 'up', 'lot', 'flaws', 'air', 'have', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'cast', 'really', 'look', 'forward', 'Calister', 'Flockhart', 'hm', 'well', 'just', 'Ally', 'Kitty', 'disguise', 'best', 'characterisation', 'written', 'circus', 'relationship', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'still', 'great', 'utilised', '5', 'whole', 'seasons', 'Six', 'Feet', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'performance', 'will', 'be', 'settled', 'marriage', 'coverage', 'not', 'really', 'depth', 'thus', 'family', 'drama', 'became', 'very', 'trivial', 'compared', 'big', 'picture', 'Sally', 'Field', 'funny', 'annoying', 'same', 'time', 'how', 'well', 'did', 'work', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'great', 'well', 'done', 'relationship', 'Jason', 'Lewis', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'thought', 'will', 'have', 'bigger', 'coverage', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'just', 'funny', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'well', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'thought', 'still', 'watchable.The', 'problem', 'bunch', 'great', 'actors', 'really', 'need', 'other', 'good', 'actors', 'support', 'Why', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'playing', 'Justin', 'Tommy', 'were', 'chosen', 'be', 'show', 'mystery', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'compared', 'rest', 'cast', 'Wooden', 'acting', 'bad', 'story', 'lines', 'so', 'called', 'drama', 'just', 'nerve', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'boring', 'will', 'be', 'two', 'major', 'problem', 'could', 'kill', 'show', 'following', 'season', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'interesting', 'be', 'written', 'actors', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'act', 'Boring', 'actors', 'boring', 'characters', 'mean', 'switching', 'channels.Storywise', 'have', 'good', 'episodes', 'bad', 'episodes', 'So', 'when', 'watch', 'show', 'just', 'feel', 'strolling', 'rocky', 'outback', 'bush', 'area', 'Certain', 'parts', 'are', 'really', 'cliche', 'disappointing', 'When', 'storylines', 'come', 'up', 'just', 'feel', 'come', 'can', 'have', 'something', 'else', 'think', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'storyline', 'was', 'great', 'Rachel', 'Griffith', 'storyline', 'was', 'great', 'first', 'half', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'storyline', 'was', 'great', 'second', 'half', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'memorable', 'storylines', 'good', 'thing', 'most', 'funny', 'parts', 'are', 'funny', 'whole', 'passive', 'aggressiveness', 'family', 'are', 'just', 'wonders', 'really', 'feel', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'are', 'stuck', 'situation', 'them.Overall', 'speaking', 'Season', 'One', 'above', 'average', 'are', 'lot', 'fix', 'ABC', 'season', 'two', 'be', 'great', 'too', 'think', 'most', 'audience', 'will', 'expect', 'much', 'better', 'Season', 'Two', 'switch', 'TV', 'change', 'channel']",N/A
1079577,A1WSFHRBY2ZD1R,B000R7HRRA,"T. Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[41, 54]","Somehow over the last couple of seasons ABC has climbs its way up the network latter from the #5 position right to # 1 thanks in part of hits such as ""Desperate Housewives,"" ""Grey's Anatomy,"" and ""Lost.""  Trying desperately to cash in on their success, ABC greenlite over 12 pilots last year including ""Ugly Betty"" and yes, ""Brothers and Sisters.""  I initially tuned into B&S; because it aired directly after ""Desperate Housewives"" and starred Rachel Griffiths (of ""Six Feet Under"" fame), but something very interesting happened.  Over the course of several weeks I found myself not watching ""Desperate Housewives"" but never missing a single episode of B&S.;The show (kinda like ""Six Feet Under"" in some fashions) follows a very weathly/affluent Southern California family as they deal with the death of their patriarch.  Over the last decade as the siblings in the family aged from their late teens, to early thirties (and further apart with each year) and thus are almost strangers to one another.  But as fate would have it, tragedy strikes and they are forced to bond together, for the first time in decades.  Sarah, the oldest, is in charge of continuing the family business despite her brother Tommy working for their father for the better part of a decade.  Kitty, forshaking her family for a political career as a democrat after 9/11 (her entire family is republican) comes home in an attempt to smooth-over familial problems, despite not speaking to her mother, Nora, in over 5 years, after she convinced the youngest family member, Justin to join the army in response to the 9/11 attacks; her only alley being the middle brother, Kevin.The entire first season basically follows the Walker family as they try to move-on with life after the death of their father/husband and the repercussions of the life he lived.  Several mysteries are presented surrounding his death including millions missing from corporate accounts, old lovers coming back, and potential bankruptcy for the family.  But the family powers through these dramas, and many bonding, bonding themselves back to being as tight-knit (if not more) as they were growing up.Personally I find this series engaging because while its dramatic, it never takes itself too seriously and allows for several very hilarious episodes to be introduced into the mix of drama.  Additionally it takes the series no time at all to get going.  While many new shows take 13, sometimes 25 episodes to get their feet wet, `Brothers and Sisters' is off and running almost from the pilot.  Included in this DVD is all 23 episodes on 6 discs with Deleted Scenes, Audio Commentary, Interviews with the Cast, Set tour, several futurities, as well as the original pilot episode featuring different actors in many key parts.",5,Welcome to the Family,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,2767,"['Somehow', 'last', 'couple', 'seasons', 'ABC', 'climbs', 'way', 'network', 'latter', '5', 'position', 'right', '1', 'thanks', 'part', 'hits', 'such', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'Lost', 'Trying', 'desperately', 'cash', 'success', 'ABC', 'greenlite', '12', 'pilots', 'last', 'year', 'including', 'Ugly', 'Betty', 'yes', 'Brothers', 'Sisters', 'initially', 'tuned', 'B', 'S', 'aired', 'directly', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'starred', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'Six', 'Feet', 'fame', 'something', 'very', 'interesting', 'happened', 'course', 'several', 'weeks', 'found', 'not', 'watching', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'never', 'missing', 'single', 'episode', 'B', 'S', 'show', 'kinda', 'Six', 'Feet', 'fashions', 'very', 'weathly/affluent', 'Southern', 'California', 'family', 'deal', 'death', 'patriarch', 'last', 'decade', 'siblings', 'family', 'aged', 'late', 'teens', 'early', 'thirties', 'further', 'apart', 'year', 'thus', 'are', 'almost', 'strangers', 'one', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'are', 'forced', 'bond', 'together', 'first', 'time', 'decades', 'Sarah', 'oldest', 'charge', 'continuing', 'family', 'business', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'working', 'father', 'better', 'part', 'decade', 'Kitty', 'forshaking', 'family', 'political', 'career', 'democrat', '9/11', 'entire', 'family', 'republican', 'home', 'attempt', 'smooth-over', 'familial', 'problems', 'not', 'speaking', 'mother', 'Nora', '5', 'years', 'convinced', 'youngest', 'family', 'member', 'Justin', 'join', 'army', 'response', '9/11', 'attacks', 'only', 'alley', 'being', 'middle', 'brother', 'Kevin.The', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'basically', 'Walker', 'family', 'try', 'move-on', 'life', 'death', 'father/husband', 'repercussions', 'life', 'lived', 'Several', 'mysteries', 'are', 'presented', 'surrounding', 'death', 'including', 'millions', 'missing', 'corporate', 'accounts', 'old', 'lovers', 'coming', 'back', 'potential', 'bankruptcy', 'family', 'family', 'powers', 'dramas', 'many', 'bonding', 'bonding', 'back', 'being', 'tight-knit', 'not', 'more', 'were', 'growing', 'up.Personally', 'find', 'series', 'engaging', 'dramatic', 'never', 'too', 'seriously', 'several', 'very', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'be', 'introduced', 'mix', 'drama', 'Additionally', 'series', 'time', 'get', 'going', 'many', 'new', 'shows', 'take', '13', 'sometimes', '25', 'episodes', 'get', 'feet', 'wet', 'Brothers', 'Sisters', 'running', 'almost', 'pilot', 'Included', 'DVD', '23', 'episodes', '6', 'discs', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'Interviews', 'Cast', 'Set', 'tour', 'several', 'futurities', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'pilot', 'episode', 'featuring', 'different', 'actors', 'many', 'key', 'parts']",N/A
