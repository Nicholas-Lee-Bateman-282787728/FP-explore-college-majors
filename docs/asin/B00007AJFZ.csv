Sales people get off on tangents about technical things and price objections. Sales managers want a repeatable performance, like a Ben Hogan golf swing, but strictly as prescribed by the company. But through it all people like to buy from people they like.The strong point about this story is that it is true. The movie makers may have sugar coated it but Bill Porter must have won friends, in spite of everything, in the toughest of the selling routines, or he could never had made it through 40 years.

Despite his condition, his mother encourages him and advises ""patience and persistence.""  We are told that Porter's father was a successful salesman before his passing which is part of the back story. During the interview, the Sales Manager discourages Porter because of the physical demands of the job. Porter leaves the interview having been denied the job. But he turns around and asks for the worst territory with the advice that if he suceeds the Manger will be a hero, if he fails then nothing is lost.  With that Porter has done his first sales job.We then see him going door to door the first time on his route and the reactions of prospects to this vocally and physically handicapped man.  At one home a young boy reacts in fright to Porter's appearance and manner of speech.  That results in a complaint to the Company.  The next scene has Porter using a hand puppet and humor the next time he calls on that house.  The child's fears are allayed and he gets an order from the boy's mother.  When Porter gets his first sale on his first day out, he celebrates by taking his mother out to dinner at a neighborhood diner.This story follows Porter over a 50 year period.  He continues to work the same territory and we see how his relationships grow with the customers on his 7 mile route.  During this period, he faces challenges such as his mother becoming a victim of Alzheimers, his need to deliver purchases to his customers, his own accidental broken leg that puts him out of business for a time.  He solves each of these and pushes on.  One of the humorous scenes occurs while he is in traction with his leg in the hospital.  We see him pitching his product while in the hopsital bed, then the camera pans out and we see that the man in the next bed listening and responding to Porter's pitch is confined in worse shape than Bill.This is a very humane presentation of an individual who refused to become bound by his limitation.  Porter is depicted as someone who is very goood in building relationships while following the dictum ""always be selling.""  The film is presented in chapters of about 7-8 year periods.  So we follow Porter during his entire career, including changes in the Watkins Company's method of sales.  We see how he adapts and goes on.William Macy plays Porter and does a wonderfull acting job losing himself in the character.  I was convinced by Macy's acting.

He is also plays a very likeable developmentally disabled person in this film. Bring a Kleenex box along when you view this movie.  As a parent of a severely disabled autistic boy, I felt for the character who was limited in his coping skills but who tried and tried and tried to make his life meaningful and to help others through his job as a traveling salesman.

726156,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00007AJFZ,Joseph Haschka,"[14, 15]","One doesn't see the classic DOOR TO DOOR salesman anymore. (The occasional youthful hawker of magazine subscriptions or Girl Scout cookies doesn't count.) But for more than 40 years beginning in 1955, Bill Porter walked the same sales route in Oregon for the (real-life) Watkins Company, which sold (and still sells) an esoteric mix of products from laundry soap to dog biscuits to condiments.Porter was afflicted with cerebral palsy at birth. In this made-for-TV film, Porter (William Macy) explains its cause as the too assiduous application of forceps by the obstetrician who delivered him.  As the film opens, Bill is attempting, at age 21, to land his first job as a salesman, the profession of his deceased father. Porter is encouraged and supported by his mother (Helen Mirren), who writes the words ""patience"" and ""persistence"" with ketchup on the outside of her son's brown-bag sandwiches after Watkins reluctantly hires the young man. To prove that he can do the job despite his disability, Porter has challenged Watson by offering to take the toughest sales route that nobody else wants. Soon after, Bill's mother begins to suffer the mental impairment that eventually lands her in an assisted care facility. Bill is now on his solitary own.If it wasn't for Macy's performance, DOOR TO DOOR would just be another of those warm and fuzzy human interest stories that otherwise makes my eyeballs roll for its political correctness. Macy, who's cast in the lead too infrequently, turns in his best performance since FOCUS (2001) - perhaps better. The actor's depiction of Porter's handicap is a pointed reminder of the difficulties to be surmounted by one so afflicted, even including painful isolation from normal, male-female sexual intimacy and romance.At the end of the film's credits, the audience is made aware of the fact that the real-life Bill Porter has a website. Out of curiosity, I signed onto it and discovered that it's actually a link to Watson's on-line shopping catalog. It left me wondering if I hadn't just been manipulated into watching a lengthy Watson promo. It's that vague feeling of having been conned that causes me to award 4 stars instead of the five otherwise due Macy's brilliant work.",4,Patience and Persistence,1045785600,"02 21, 2003",2003,2223,"['One', ""n't"", 'see', 'classic', 'DOOR', 'TO', 'DOOR', 'salesman', 'anymore', 'occasional', 'youthful', 'hawker', 'magazine', 'subscriptions', 'Girl', 'Scout', 'cookies', ""n't"", 'count', 'more', '40', 'years', 'beginning', '1955', 'Bill', 'Porter', 'walked', 'same', 'sales', 'route', 'Oregon', 'real-life', 'Company', 'sold', 'still', 'esoteric', 'mix', 'products', 'laundry', 'soap', 'dog', 'biscuits', 'condiments.Porter', 'was', 'afflicted', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'birth', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'Porter', 'William', 'Macy', 'cause', 'too', 'assiduous', 'application', 'forceps', 'obstetrician', 'who', 'delivered', 'film', 'Bill', 'attempting', 'age', '21', 'land', 'first', 'job', 'salesman', 'profession', 'deceased', 'father', 'Porter', 'encouraged', 'supported', 'mother', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'who', 'words', 'patience', 'persistence', 'ketchup', 'outside', 'son', 'brown-bag', 'sandwiches', 'Watkins', 'reluctantly', 'young', 'man', 'prove', 'can', 'do', 'job', 'disability', 'Porter', 'challenged', 'Watson', 'offering', 'take', 'toughest', 'sales', 'route', 'nobody', 'else', 'Soon', 'Bill', 'mother', 'suffer', 'mental', 'impairment', 'eventually', 'assisted', 'care', 'facility', 'Bill', 'now', 'solitary', 'own.If', 'was', ""n't"", 'Macy', 'performance', 'DOOR', 'TO', 'DOOR', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'human', 'interest', 'stories', 'otherwise', 'eyeballs', 'roll', 'political', 'correctness', 'Macy', 'who', 'cast', 'lead', 'too', 'infrequently', 'best', 'performance', 'FOCUS', '2001', 'perhaps', 'better', 'actor', 'depiction', 'Porter', 'handicap', 'pointed', 'reminder', 'difficulties', 'be', 'surmounted', 'one', 'so', 'afflicted', 'even', 'including', 'painful', 'isolation', 'normal', 'male-female', 'sexual', 'intimacy', 'romance.At', 'end', 'film', 'credits', 'audience', 'made', 'aware', 'fact', 'real-life', 'Bill', 'Porter', 'website', 'curiosity', 'signed', 'discovered', 'actually', 'link', 'Watson', 'on-line', 'shopping', 'catalog', 'left', 'wondering', 'had', ""n't"", 'just', 'been', 'manipulated', 'watching', 'lengthy', 'Watson', 'promo', 'vague', 'feeling', 'having', 'been', 'conned', 'award', '4', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'otherwise', 'due', 'Macy', 'brilliant', 'work']",N/A
