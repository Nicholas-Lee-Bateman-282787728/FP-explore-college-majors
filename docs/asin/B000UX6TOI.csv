1097417,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B000UX6TOI,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[18, 18]","This is a very good documentary of Johnny Cash's life, including his struggles between good and evil, stuggles with his personal life, struggles with his family life, his career, health problems, and etc. This shows how his strong faith in GOD got him throught these struggles.The documentary is narrated by Dan Rather. This Dvd also highlights the Gospel Music of Johnny Cash.It starts by describing his humble beginnings as a child being raised on a farm in the rural Arkansas delta. It progresses into his service to the country in the military. While he was stationed in Germany, he bought a guitar and learned to play and sing. He had met his first wife by this time and when he was honorably discharged, the two married and moved to Memphis. He auditioned for Sam Phillips at Sun Records by playing gospel songs, but Sam said he would not record any gospel songs. So, Johnny began recording early rollabilly songs and became a star. The early touring took a toll on Johnny and he resorted to drugs to cope. This took a toll on his first marriage and it ended.Johnny hit bottom and was disfunctional for about a year, then he got involved with June Carter and mother Maybelle Carter. June was a true helpmate and helped him get his life back together. They married and his career became sucessful again. Sam Phillips lets him record some gospel songs and he performs ""I Was there when it happened"".The Dvd shows some footage of Johnny, June and his band performing some gospel songs at San Quinton.  Some of these include: ""He turned the water into Wine"", ""Daddy sang bass"", and ""Man in Black"" (he wrote this song for all the down-trodden people in the world).The dvd documents John and Junes trips to the ""Holy Land"", and their filming of a movie about the life of Christ,in the ""Holy Land"". Some more great gospel song performances from Johnny include: ""Over the Next Hill We'll be Home"", ""Peace in the Valley"", ""Why me Lord"", ""The Old Rugged Cross"", and ""I'm Just an old Chunk of Coal"". These are performed at a Billy Graham Crusade. Johnny gives great testimony of his faith and devotion to Jesus Christ.Tragedy strikes Johnnny again,as he is attacked by a large male Ostrich, at his farm in Tennesee. Some of his ribs are broken, and his stomach is torn open. He recovers but gets addicted to pain pills. He goes into the Betty Ford clinic and recovers. He rejoins Billy Graham at a Crusade, and gives great testimony again. He also performs some more great gospel songs including ""One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to Paul""(this is and outstanding song written and performed by Johnny,).Johnny and June go back to the ""Holy Land"", and he performs ""I won't have to cross Jordan alone"". They reappear back on a Billy Graham Crusade where they perform ""What on earth will you do for Heaven's sake"", and ""the old account was settled long ago"". Again, Johnny gives great testimony of his Christian Faith.The documentary draws to a close and discusses Johnny's last few years alive, the death of his wife of 35 years June Carter Cash, and Johnny's worsening health problems. He is interviewed by Larry King and is asked if he is bitter, because of his bad health, and Johnny replys ""No, I don't have any reason to be bitter"", ""I've had a great life"". It ends by covering Johnny's last recordings and his death. This dvd is a great ""Story of Faith and Redemption"".",4,"The Gospel Music of Johnny Cash ""Faith & Redemption""",1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,3380,"['very', 'good', 'documentary', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'life', 'including', 'struggles', 'good', 'evil', 'stuggles', 'personal', 'life', 'family', 'life', 'career', 'health', 'problems', 'etc', 'how', 'strong', 'faith', 'GOD', 'got', 'throught', 'struggles.The', 'documentary', 'narrated', 'Dan', 'Rather', 'Dvd', 'also', 'Gospel', 'Music', 'Johnny', 'Cash.It', 'describing', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'child', 'being', 'raised', 'farm', 'rural', 'Arkansas', 'delta', 'service', 'country', 'military', 'was', 'stationed', 'Germany', 'bought', 'guitar', 'learned', 'play', 'sing', 'had', 'met', 'first', 'wife', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'honorably', 'discharged', 'two', 'married', 'moved', 'Memphis', 'auditioned', 'Sam', 'Phillips', 'Sun', 'Records', 'playing', 'gospel', 'songs', 'Sam', 'said', 'would', 'not', 'record', 'gospel', 'songs', 'So', 'Johnny', 'began', 'recording', 'early', 'rollabilly', 'songs', 'became', 'star', 'early', 'touring', 'took', 'toll', 'Johnny', 'resorted', 'drugs', 'cope', 'took', 'toll', 'first', 'marriage', 'ended.Johnny', 'hit', 'bottom', 'was', 'disfunctional', 'year', 'then', 'got', 'involved', 'June', 'Carter', 'mother', 'Maybelle', 'Carter', 'June', 'was', 'true', 'helpmate', 'helped', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'married', 'career', 'became', 'sucessful', 'again', 'Sam', 'Phillips', 'record', 'gospel', 'songs', 'Was', 'there', 'when', 'happened', '.The', 'Dvd', 'footage', 'Johnny', 'June', 'band', 'performing', 'gospel', 'songs', 'San', 'Quinton', 'include', 'turned', 'water', 'Wine', 'Daddy', 'sang', 'bass', 'Man', 'Black', 'wrote', 'song', 'down-trodden', 'people', 'world', '.The', 'dvd', 'documents', 'John', 'Junes', 'trips', 'Holy', 'Land', 'filming', 'movie', 'life', 'Christ', 'Holy', 'Land', 'more', 'great', 'gospel', 'song', 'performances', 'Johnny', 'include', 'Next', 'Hill', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Home', 'Peace', 'Valley', 'Why', 'Lord', 'Old', 'Rugged', 'Cross', ""'m"", 'Just', 'old', 'Chunk', 'Coal', 'are', 'performed', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'Crusade', 'Johnny', 'great', 'testimony', 'faith', 'devotion', 'Jesus', 'Christ.Tragedy', 'strikes', 'Johnnny', 'again', 'attacked', 'large', 'male', 'Ostrich', 'farm', 'Tennesee', 'ribs', 'are', 'broken', 'stomach', 'torn', 'open', 'addicted', 'pain', 'pills', 'Betty', 'Ford', 'clinic', 'recovers', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'Crusade', 'great', 'testimony', 'again', 'also', 'more', 'great', 'gospel', 'songs', 'including', 'One', 'days', ""'m"", 'gon', 'sit', 'down', 'talk', 'Paul', 'outstanding', 'song', 'written', 'performed', 'Johnny', '.Johnny', 'June', 'go', 'back', 'Holy', 'Land', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'cross', 'Jordan', 'alone', 'reappear', 'back', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'Crusade', 'where', 'perform', 'What', 'earth', 'will', 'do', 'Heaven', 'sake', 'old', 'account', 'was', 'settled', 'long', 'ago', 'Again', 'Johnny', 'great', 'testimony', 'Christian', 'Faith.The', 'documentary', 'draws', 'close', 'Johnny', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'alive', 'death', 'wife', '35', 'years', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'Johnny', 'worsening', 'health', 'problems', 'interviewed', 'Larry', 'King', 'asked', 'bitter', 'bad', 'health', 'Johnny', 'replys', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'reason', 'be', 'bitter', ""'ve"", 'had', 'great', 'life', 'covering', 'Johnny', 'last', 'recordings', 'death', 'dvd', 'great', 'Story', 'Faith', 'Redemption']",The Gospel Music of Johnny Cash

1097419,A174BXC8KMRC92,B000UX6TOI,"Kenneth Richard ""Saintken; CashFan 4life""","[62, 62]","This documentary hosted by Dan Rather looks into John's reason for singing in the first place and how he was able to use his music to spread God's word.  There are interviews to be sure, Marshal Grant, John Carter Cash, and more, but most importantly they let John's music play a big part of this DVD.  Far too many of these retrospective, documenteries, interrupt the musical performances with interviews, not this one.  The performances stand on their own, with few exceptions.  The perfomances start with an old black and white performance that can be found on other DVD's, but that's it, later perfomances have him and with June performing several songs from the Billy Graham crusades.  Jewels, everyone of them.  It also has photos of John at June's funeral and ends with a still photo from John's own funeral.  This is THE BEST documentary I've seen on John (it doesn't cover all aspects of his life, just concentrates on his gospel music and his relationship with God).  Don't let the use of the term ""documentary"" scare you from this DVD, the concert performances are great and the songs (for the most part) are uninterrupted.
