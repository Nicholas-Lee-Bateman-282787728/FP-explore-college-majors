This combination provides fertile ground for comedy. There is another factor here and that is social history.

You think it's going to start out that way, and then wham, the writers come at from an unexpected direction like a run-away train. While Victor is admittedly an old grouch, you can't help but like him because he's always the underdog. While his life has been far from perfect, he has the love and support of his long suffering wife, and they share a comfortable home together. So his isn't a bad life. He just has the worst luck, and ends up in the craziest situations, often through no fault of his own. The funniest scenes though are when it's absolutely his own doing. Victor's moaning can get on your nerves at times, like nails on a chalkboard, but before it gets too bad something crazy always happens. I don't like how the show ended, but honestly, it really was probably the only way. You'll have to watch it if you want to find out. No spoiler's here!

""The Complete Collection One Foot in the Grave"" is a series based on confusion, retirement, and moaning. Situations are absurd and unbelievable--but pile up on newly retired Victor Meldrew like maggots on road kill. You will soon understand the why behind his famous line, ""I don't believe it!""Victor is played by Richard Wilson, a role he'll never live down. He's the Grumpiest of Old Men. He is as fantastic as the script (writer: David Renwick). Victor is the World champion of smart aleck retorts. He's King Curmudgeon. The British Bard of Barbs. Just when you give up hope for something more than cynicism from Victor, he provides an oasis bit of tenderness, a note of loving affection toward his wife. Actually, Victor, attacks every annoying item in society and life, taking natural law into his own hands, only he uses his mouth, and sometimes cunning retaliation. It's funny. He dares do what we've all been tempted to do. He's the occasional ""Robin Hood"" of OAP (old age pensioners). But you don't have to be old and retired to enjoy this one-man crusade against injustice of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. We've all been there, and you too will cheer Victor's act first-think second attack on fate's little burrs of life. Victor is a moaner and complainer with a purpose. Getting even?Margaret (Annette Crosbie) puts up with her grumpy, conclusion-jumping husband, because she loves him. Interestingly, in the series she begins as the sweet opposite of Victor. As the years pass, they become more and more alike, disagreeable and dislike-able. But so, so, so funny.The writing is a masterpiece of convoluted plots, woven together so smoothly, that one is forgotten in the movement into another, then, when least expecting it, some silly consequence occurs from the earlier plot activity. In the end, it's all drawn together, but often leaving one tiny aspect left to the viewer's imagination. It just makes it that much more fun. My wife and I are 60+, retired, and could relate.WARNING:Unrated DVDs contain language issues: heavy vane use of Deity names & such.

1040755,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B000LV6OJO,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[7, 7]","This series was recommended to me by Amazon since I like Britcoms like 'Are You Being Served?,'  'Yes, Minster,' 'Keeping Up Appearances,' and 'Fawlty Towers.'  I had never seen this show, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Like many British sitcoms (contrary to American ones), this series deals with the senior age group.  Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson), a grouch at the latter half of middle age with the sarcastic wit of Basil Fawlty, is forced into early retirement from his job in security reception (""redundancy,"" as they call it in England).  He doesn't adjust well to all his new-found free time as he spends most of his days complaining about neighbors, incompetent fix-it men, strangers who annoy him, and--a continuing theme--litter in his front lawn.  Suffering along with him is his wife Margaret (Annette Crosbie), who seems to work part time as a caregiver, who has to listen to his constant bellyaching.  The first two episodes I thought were mildly amusing.  The show seemed rather slow (albeit faster moving than 'Last of the Summer Wine,' and 'As Time Goes By').  I thought I'd give it 2 maybe 3 stars at the most, then it started picking up.  The last four episodes have many hilarious moments and I've found myself laughing out loud.  A bonus is a featurette defending the show's merits as ""Britain's Best Sitcom.""  I'm still not convinced.  I still think it is 'Fawlty Towers,' but 'One Foot in the Grave' definitely has its moments.""Alive and Buried""--Victor Meldrew--who worked in security reception--is replaced by an automated system and is forced into early retirement.  To pass the time, he collects wrappers left in his front lawn, practices magic acts (the magician side of him seems a bit out-of-character), shouts at mechanics, and is accused of suspected curb crawling (like Hyacinth's brother-in-law Bruce in 'Keeping Up Appearances').  Speaking of 'Keeping Up Appearances,' I notice his telephone conversations are not done as well at Patricia Routledge.  He talks too fast to convince the viewer there is someone on the other line.""The Big Sleep""--It's hard for Victor not to think about dying when death is all around him--his cousin, the health & fitness instructor, even a bird he feeds worms to in his front yard.""The Valley of Fear""--Victor gets tired of Margaret leaving doors and cupboards open: ""What am I supposed to do, carry out a daily inspection of the premises now for batty old women and mummified tomcats.""  Concerned about hooligans, Victor organizes a neighborhood watch and ends up getting a hoodlum reputation himself.  Christopher Ryan ('The Young Ones') makes an appearance as a plumber in shorts.""I'll Retire to Bedlam""--Victor is in an even fouler mood than usual as he's attacked by bees, his little grand-nephews, and Britain's peculiar medical service.  Best moments are in the doctor's office and his handling of his bratty nephews.""The Eternal Quadrangle""--Margaret is not happy about Victor sketching a nude woman in art class...especially when he accepts a job cleaning at the nude model's house.  I liked the vacuum duel between Victor and the model's senile father.  In the meantime, Margaret finds she has an admirer.  It is funny how dense Victor is about his wife's friend's intentions.""The Return of the Speckled Band""--Victor and Margaret get ready for a trip to Athens.  In the meantime, Victor unknowingly keeps making life miserable for Mrs. Warboy and the Meldrews unknowingly have a new companion--a 7-foot Indian Python (speaking of pythons, Eric Idle of 'Monty Python' fame wrote and sang the show's theme song).

It's a comedy along the lines of Fawlty Towers, The Thin Blue Line and Blackadder. Yet, One Foot in the Grave is distinctly unique. It covers an overlooked segment of the population (the recently retired & aging segment).If you have never saw One Foot in the Grave, start at season 1 and work your way up through all the seasons. The show and characters are more enjoyable watched in order, as many times they will work off something that occured in a previous show. Season 1 has its share of hilarious moments.

He feels he's just been forced to wait for death. As he battles against a world that now longer makes sense, trouble seems to find him at every corner. Richard Wilson plays Victor Meldrew and Annette Crosbie plays as his wife Margaret Meldrew. Both Crosbie and Wilson are hysterical & believable.

So much so that Richard Wilson couldn't go out in public without it being yelled at him. To this day, 10 years after 'One Foot..' ended he still gets asked to say it.
