Denise is a little more subdued in this video (not crazy and wild-eyed like she is in the boot camp video). As always, she delivers an inense workout that not only works your core, but also other parts of your body. Even though you are working hard you are not out of breath and drenched.",4,Good workout without dripping sweat,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,334,"['video', 'good', 'addition', 'collection', 'Denise', 'little', 'more', 'subdued', 'video', 'not', 'crazy', 'wild-eyed', 'boot', 'camp', 'video', 'always', 'inense', 'workout', 'not', 'only', 'core', 'also', 'other', 'parts', 'body', 'Even', 'are', 'working', 'hard', 'are', 'not', 'breath', 'drenched']",N/A

Some of her mostly older ones are totally cheesy and over the top. This one is somewhere in the middle. It is faster paced with light weights and not enough reps (also typical of her older workouts). I expected more of a challenge but didn't feel worked out in the end. The concept is good, three separate chapters for different muscle groups plus core in each, then one premix that combines a few pieces of each chapter into one bonus workout, but it didn't work for me. I used much heavier weights since the rep count was so low, but her quick transition between exercises made it hard to switch and adjust weights without pausing the DVD. It was not horrible but not good either.",3,Not for Me,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,827,"['admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'videos', 'newer', 'DVDs', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'where', 'down', 'little', 'improved', 'queing', 'mostly', 'older', 'ones', 'are', 'totally', 'cheesy', 'top', 'one', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'faster', 'paced', 'light', 'weights', 'not', 'enough', 'reps', 'also', 'typical', 'older', 'workouts', 'expected', 'more', 'challenge', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'worked', 'out', 'end', 'concept', 'good', 'three', 'separate', 'chapters', 'different', 'muscle', 'groups', 'core', 'then', 'one', 'premix', 'few', 'pieces', 'chapter', 'one', 'bonus', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'used', 'much', 'heavier', 'weights', 'rep', 'count', 'was', 'so', 'low', 'quick', 'transition', 'exercises', 'made', 'hard', 'switch', 'adjust', 'weights', 'pausing', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'horrible', 'not', 'good', 'either']",N/A

1000779,AR5RYQBKKC1UT,B000GB5M0G,Kelly A. Daly,"[62, 64]","This DVD has a 5 min. warm-up, three 15 min. sections: core/upper body, core/buns and core/legs, and an 18 min. total body segment consisting of exercises taken from the other 3 sections.  You can select each workout individually or customize your workout and have the segments play in any order you choose.  If you do core/buns and core/legs, you'll get a great workout for the lower body and abs.  Those sections offer a wide variety of effective exercises.  In core/buns you'll alternate between lunges and squats with dumbells and stability ball exercises.  In core/legs you'll use your own body weight and work the outer and inner thighs and abs.  For most of the ab routines Denise shows different levels of intensity. I wasn't crazy about the core/upper body section because it only has about 4 min. of upper body work.  I think the workout would have been better with a separate core section.  I also wish there was a stretch section. It didn't bother me to alternate between body parts.  Denise's cuing is fine and she doesn't move too fast.  Overall I was pleased with my purchase.  If you liked Shrink Your Female Fat Zones you'll like this workout.

The only problem I have with her is that she is a little over the top enthusiastic and talks a little too much and isn't always in time to the music or with her own counting.This workout is good.  There are four mix and match segments: core and upper body, core and legs, core and butt, and core and full body (which is made up from the other three segments).  This way it's easy not to get bored.  You use weights and a stability ball and you can always choose the level that's best for you.

It really irritates me when others complain about her voice, and if you have never heard her talk before, she is squeaky, and horse sounding at times, but she is so positive and explains every detail of her moves.
