They are very romantic, but not sickening or explicit. The plots and cast actors are the best. Buy these movies, you'll love them. They might be chick flicks, but the male charactors are not wimpy (Russell Crowe?). Keanu Reeves on ""A Walk On The Cloud"" is a ""nice guy"", but again, not a wimp. I love ""A Good Year"" because it had a lot of humor. Anyway, get them.
