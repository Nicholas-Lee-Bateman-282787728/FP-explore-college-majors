If you want to see an entertaining movie without the prejudice of the book character because you don't know him then this is the movie to see. Odd Thomas is short order cook and Odd sees things in the supernatural realm and he helps solve crime. And this is because he sees dead people. He does not avoid them, he pays attention to what they need and tries to solve the mystery of their death, which can be tricky since the 'dead don't talk' according to Odd. But he does try to bring them peace and justice. The police know him, try to work around his quirky way of helping and solve many murders because of this. But Odd also sees other worldly things and that is dangerous because some things don't want to be seen. Standing next to him is Stormy whom he has known since they were children and knew they were meant to be together forever. Stormy knows all about him and often helps him when she can even though he tries to keep her out of that part of his life. But Stormy is stubborn and she loves Odd and would never dream of letting him go into danger without her.But something evil has come to the small desert town they live in. Something so big that even though Odd can see it coming, he dare not acknowledge it because of the consequences to him and those around him. Now he is in a race against time and a very angry ghost and hordes of demons to try to stop the evil that will change everyone's lives forever.Like I said, it's not a bad story, it's kind of quirky and somewhat endearing. It does have some violence, can't get away from that but not gratuitous and some great special effects.",4,Very Interesting,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,1772,"['are', 'Dean', 'Koontz', 'fan', 'might', 'not', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'Odd', 'Thomas', 'common', 'book', 'character', 'towns', 'people', 'want', 'see', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'prejudice', 'book', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'then', 'movie', 'see', 'Odd', 'Thomas', 'short', 'order', 'cook', 'Odd', 'things', 'supernatural', 'realm', 'solve', 'crime', 'dead', 'people', 'not', 'avoid', 'attention', 'what', 'need', 'tries', 'solve', 'mystery', 'death', 'can', 'be', 'tricky', ""'dead"", 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'according', 'Odd', 'try', 'bring', 'peace', 'justice', 'police', 'know', 'try', 'work', 'around', 'quirky', 'way', 'helping', 'solve', 'many', 'murders', 'Odd', 'also', 'other', 'worldly', 'things', 'dangerous', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'seen', 'Standing', 'next', 'Stormy', 'whom', 'known', 'were', 'children', 'knew', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'together', 'forever', 'Stormy', 'often', 'when', 'can', 'even', 'keep', 'part', 'life', 'Stormy', 'stubborn', 'Odd', 'would', 'never', 'dream', 'letting', 'go', 'danger', 'her.But', 'something', 'evil', 'come', 'small', 'desert', 'town', 'live', 'Something', 'so', 'big', 'even', 'Odd', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'not', 'acknowledge', 'consequences', 'Now', 'race', 'time', 'very', 'angry', 'ghost', 'hordes', 'demons', 'try', 'stop', 'evil', 'will', 'change', 'everyone', 'lives', 'forever.Like', 'said', 'not', 'bad', 'story', 'kind', 'quirky', 'somewhat', 'endearing', 'have', 'violence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'great', 'special', 'effects']",N/A

The director made a great choice in casting Yelchin; his performance is on point. Everything else about this movie sucks.The screenplay is throwaway. Willem Dafoe is wasted. Odd's girl Stormy (Addison Timlin) is very annoying. Everything is too scripted. Instead of introducing these characters one at a time, Odd Thomas plays like a sequel. There's a much larger story behind this misadventure, and the director ignores it.Odd is working at his gig as a short-order cook when a suspicious looking character stumbles into the diner. He is soon followed by a pack of demons, who look to be lifted straight from Constantine(2005). They look identical to the demons hunting Keanu Reeves except for their semi-transparent, metallic skin. Did the director use the same CGI models? It sure looks like it.

I felt there was a great premise here and who doesn't like a nice, predictable story about seeing ghosts and trying to help those ghosts solve problems? Quite original in that aspect. Don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it barring The Sixth Sense, The Ghost Whisperer, Hulu's new series Deadbeat, Dead Like Me... er... yeah.Here are the things that stuck in my craw (I'm very hip with the new lingo kids use these days).There's only so many times I can hear character say, &#34;Nothing about you is normal, Odd!&#34; I'm paraphrasing of course but these responses to various situations throughout the movie were peppered throughout and I wanted to drill a hole in the back of my head and pull my eyeballs out. I'm being melodramatic of course. And figurative just in case anyone's confused.The &#34;I love yous&#34; between Stormy and Odd plus their &#34;witty&#34; banter (barf) was enough to make a full prediction that she would bite it at the end. The interaction between these two were so sickeningly sweet that I got the diabetus. I recovered soon after but it was a heck of a ride.It was never clear (to me at least) what the relationship between Willem Dafoe's character and Odd. Was it just a professional relationship or was he Odd's father?All throughout the movie (and yes I know they tried to backtrack and do a Sixth Sense review) it was never alluded to that there were 4 conspirators. It seemed like they popped up for convenience and to &#34;shock&#34; the viewer when all it really did was annoy. I face palmed about that for a long time.And I guess finally is the overabundance of exposition. It seems like they really crammed a lot into the movie and to save on time we get lengthy voice overs trying to explain the rules of the universe Odd lives in.In conclusion this is a pretty film with some nice visuals even though it wasn't exactly an adventurous style. The story was lacking, the acting subpar, but I will say the final ending of the movie was nicely done and emotional to boot.",2,Hey Odd you're Odd!,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,2242,"['****SPOILERS', 'LURK', 'AHEAD*****Though', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'Dean', 'Koontz', 'work', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'Odd', 'Thomas', 'series', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'come', 'up', 'Netflix', 'was', 'entering', 'pure', 'Odd', 'Thomas', 'saw', 'was', 'mixed', 'bag', 'felt', 'was', 'great', 'premise', 'here', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'nice', 'predictable', 'story', 'seeing', 'ghosts', 'trying', 'help', 'ghosts', 'solve', 'problems', 'Quite', 'original', 'aspect', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'barring', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer', 'Hulu', 'new', 'series', 'Deadbeat', 'Dead', 'Me', 'er', 'yeah.Here', 'are', 'things', 'stuck', 'craw', ""'m"", 'very', 'hip', 'new', 'lingo', 'kids', 'use', 'days', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'hear', 'character', 'say', '34', 'Nothing', 'normal', 'Odd', '34', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'course', 'responses', 'various', 'situations', 'movie', 'were', 'peppered', 'wanted', 'drill', 'hole', 'back', 'head', 'pull', 'eyeballs', 'out', ""'m"", 'being', 'melodramatic', 'course', 'figurative', 'just', 'case', 'anyone', 'confused.The', '34', 'love', 'yous', '34', 'Stormy', 'Odd', '34', 'witty', '34', 'banter', 'barf', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'full', 'prediction', 'would', 'bite', 'end', 'interaction', 'two', 'were', 'so', 'sickeningly', 'sweet', 'got', 'diabetus', 'recovered', 'soon', 'was', 'heck', 'ride.It', 'was', 'never', 'clear', 'least', 'what', 'relationship', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'character', 'Odd', 'Was', 'just', 'professional', 'relationship', 'was', 'Odd', 'father', 'movie', 'yes', 'know', 'tried', 'backtrack', 'do', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'review', 'was', 'never', 'alluded', 'were', '4', 'conspirators', 'seemed', 'popped', 'up', 'convenience', '34', 'shock', '34', 'viewer', 'when', 'really', 'did', 'was', 'annoy', 'face', 'palmed', 'long', 'time.And', 'guess', 'finally', 'overabundance', 'exposition', 'really', 'crammed', 'lot', 'movie', 'save', 'time', 'get', 'lengthy', 'voice', 'overs', 'trying', 'explain', 'rules', 'universe', 'Odd', 'in.In', 'conclusion', 'pretty', 'film', 'nice', 'visuals', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'adventurous', 'style', 'story', 'was', 'lacking', 'acting', 'subpar', 'will', 'say', 'final', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'nicely', 'done', 'emotional', 'boot']",N/A

Joe: The Rise of Cobra.&#34; The issue is that &#34;Odd Thomas&#34; feels extremely outdated like if &#34;The Mummy&#34; from 1999 was released today. Financial woes seemed to plague the film not only during production but while trying to get a potential release, as well. So depending on how long the film sat on the shelf (for example &#34;The Cabin in the Woods&#34; was on the shelf for three years before release and yet was still awesome), it very well could be more dated than it seems.It should be apparent that Sommers is directing early on with the Arnold Vosloo cameo, nearly unbearable humor, and cheesy special effects. It isn't so much a bad thing that Sommers is still making films today, but it seems like the Indianapolis born director is completely blind to what audiences want these days and keeps making the types of films that may have been successful 15 years ago.&#34;Odd Thomas&#34; suffers from a rambling narrative that adores the sound of its own voice. Odd narrates his own story, which is fine, but it honestly just seems like an excuse to hear the character that much more. Odd is constantly talking. He's very quirky and weird and he lives up to his name, but his speeches get on your nerves and just when you think you'll have a moment of peace and quiet he chimes in with a voiceover that lasts another three minutes to drive you insane. His relationship with Stormy is so lovey-dovey that it'll make you sick. The special effects look like something that would be found on a movie made specifically for SyFy. The Bodachs alone would be fine, but what is the purpose of computer generating a cucumber that Odd is slicing at work?If Dean Koontz isn't ashamed of the film adaptation of his &#34;Odd Thomas&#34; series, then he either really doesn't care about the characters he creates or the books are just as awful as the film if not more so. &#34;Odd Thomas&#34; is a sloppy mixture of what could otherwise be a fun thriller. It's like a really lazy rip off of Peter Jackson's &#34;The Frighteners&#34; if it was made 18 years too late. With atrocious attempts at humor, force-fed romantic drivel shoved in your face whenever Odd and Stormy are on screen together, a main character who never knows when to shut up, and an ending you can see coming long before the climax hits, it's no wonder the film had financial problems.

He worked as a fry cook in a small greasy spoon for people who loved him unconditionally. Despite his odd gift he managed to live a fairly normal life. His one and only love Stormy was the light of his life and losing her to some bloodthirsty criminals almost destroyed him. But he found the strength to carry on but he couldn't do there. So he set out on his own to find himself and in so doing he found more dead to help. I can't wait to see more series in this line. Odd Thomas is some serious good writing. It's pretty straight forward so the creative license that any director or writer might have with the scripting has to be better than what others have done to Koontz other books such as Watchers.

Then came ""Van Helsing"" and it seems to have been down hill since.Here's the scoop. Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) is a young man in a small-ish California town. He has clairvoyant capabilities and a girlfriend who loves him dearly. His capabilities tell him there is going to be a mass murder in the town and he needs to put said capabilities to use to thwart the tragedy.This reads more like a TV pilot than a movie. (Note the final scene.) The tone is not serious enough and the humor peppered throughout has been done way better in any number of movies, including the aforementioned Sommers flicks. It also lacks any visual flair. It's very plainly shot. Much of the budget seems to have been spent on the CGI of the ""bodachs"" wraith type entities that are drawn to disaster. The acting is even mid-grade TV. Yelchin has been better and even Willem Dafoe, whom I generally like, seemed to have no emotional investment in this project. And the writing.

The sense and feel of the characters and situation were well portrayed and directed in this adaptation. The core essence of Odd Thomas and his relationship with Stormy is perfectly captured for this fan of all 6+ books.For folks not familiar with the material, watching this on the big screen may prove to be difficult. Some of the monologue and dialogue leaves one wanting to push the pause button, re-read the subtitles and then go, &#34;Oh...that's what the character is trying to say.&#34; With a book and blu-ray/DVD you can pause and re-read and figure out what exactly happened.Thus no fault of the movie, it's the accurate content the movie is based on that makes one scene in particular (up in the church bell tower) a bit difficult to follow the heavy banter between the characters.Yes, no Elvis ghost in here, which is an unfortunate direction of the movie. If they have more Odd Thomas movies (I hope they do!!) we need Frank's ghost and ghost dog for certain. Sometimes these ghosts are key to helping Odd take the next step in solving the mystery.Otherwise, I found nothing wrong with the movie. Good visuals and staying true to the books. It's the best Koontz story adaptation I can think of off the top of my head.A must watch for fans of the book.If you haven't read the book, read that first.

1689645,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00HHYF570,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 0]","RLJ/Image Entertainment brings Dean Koontz's best-selling supernatural thriller &#34;Odd Thomas&#34; to life for the big-screen. Judging the movie on its own merits without having read any of the novels, the low-budget movie is an entertaining &#34;who-dun-it&#34; featuring ghostly and ghastly guest stars. It feels like it might be better suited to being a weekly television series.Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) is a short-order cook in the seemingly lovely little town of Pico Mundo, California. However, both Pico Mundo and Odd Thomas harbor dark secrets. Odd has a &#34;gift&#34; for seeing dead people and sensing evil. The town is a haven for brutal murders, supernatural mayhem, and a feeding ground for the festering demonic specters known as bodachs. Odd teams up with his girlfriend Stormy Llewellyn (Addison Timlin) and Detective Wyatt Porter (Willem Dafoe) to solve a string of killings that somehow tie together.While I was watching &#34;Odd Thomas,&#34; I was jolted by my recollection that Stephen Sommers directed it. The SAME Stephen Sommers who produced and directed the blockbuster &#34;The Mummy&#34; movies and helmed &#34;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.&#34; You'd never know it from the independent atmosphere this carries.You can tell &#34;Odd Thomas&#34; was a labor of love for Sommers and the proof is in the credits. Not only did he direct, but he produced and wrote it. There are rumors of a lot of drama in production, but the director saw it through to the end and worked with the budget put before him.Although the budget might've been small in comparison to Stephen Sommers' other franchise films, the special effects of &#34;Odd Thomas&#34; are actually close to on par with those blockbusters. In comparison to the CGI seen today, they're a tiny bit aged but get the job done. The only noticeable digital creatures are the bodachs and they actually look a heck of a lot better than the Scorpion King did in &#34;The Mummy Returns.&#34;&#34;Odd Thomas&#34; isn't rated, but does include violence, gore, adult situations, and language. For all intents and purposes, it should hold a PG-13 rating at the most. There's nothing too graphic and no nudity is included.I felt &#34;Odd Thomas&#34; reflected some Christian beliefs well. The character speaks about how he believes in Heaven. The bodachs are obviously demonic forces that are attracted to evil, much like the fallen angels read about in the Bible. Odd also tells the killer's victims they're going to a better place. They dissolve into either glittering dust or flowers and float off after they've made peace.&#34;Odd Thomas&#34; might not be as good as it should've been had it been given more financial backing. For what it is, I found the movie charming, gleefully campy in places, and ripe for another entry in the series if this one can just pay back its budget. It's not often Dean Koontz has liked the movie adaptations of his books, but he actually likes this one.&#34;I'm just happy. You never know if anything's going to be a success or not, but I can watch this again. And the rest of them I couldn't watch again. Some [of my movies] I couldn't watch the first time,&#34; Koontz told website io9. If anyone knows if his book was adapted correctly, it would have to be the author that created the world and its characters. I still think it would work great as a weekly TV series, but I'll settle for a movie every year.",4,"Entertaining ""Odd Thomas"" Movie Gets Limited Theatrical Release",1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,3415,"['RLJ/Image', 'Entertainment', 'Dean', 'Koontz', 'best-selling', 'supernatural', 'thriller', '34', 'Odd', 'Thomas', '34', 'life', 'big-screen', 'Judging', 'movie', 'own', 'merits', 'having', 'read', 'novels', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'entertaining', '34', 'who-dun-it', '34', 'featuring', 'ghostly', 'ghastly', 'guest', 'stars', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'suited', 'being', 'weekly', 'television', 'series.Odd', 'Thomas', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'short-order', 'cook', 'seemingly', 'lovely', 'little', 'town', 'Pico', 'Mundo', 'California', 'However', 'Pico', 'Mundo', 'Odd', 'Thomas', 'harbor', 'dark', 'secrets', 'Odd', '34', 'gift', '34', 'seeing', 'dead', 'people', 'sensing', 'evil', 'town', 'haven', 'brutal', 'murders', 'supernatural', 'mayhem', 'feeding', 'ground', 'festering', 'demonic', 'specters', 'known', 'bodachs', 'Odd', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'Stormy', 'Llewellyn', 'Addison', 'Timlin', 'Detective', 'Wyatt', 'Porter', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'solve', 'string', 'killings', 'somehow', 'tie', 'together.While', 'was', 'watching', '34', 'Odd', 'Thomas', '34', 'was', 'jolted', 'recollection', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'directed', 'SAME', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'who', 'produced', 'directed', 'blockbuster', '34', 'Mummy', '34', 'movies', 'helmed', '34', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Rise', 'Cobra.', '34', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'independent', 'atmosphere', 'carries.You', 'can', 'tell', '34', 'Odd', 'Thomas', '34', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'Sommers', 'proof', 'credits', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'direct', 'produced', 'wrote', 'are', 'rumors', 'lot', 'drama', 'production', 'director', 'saw', 'end', 'worked', 'budget', 'put', 'budget', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'small', 'comparison', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'other', 'franchise', 'films', 'special', 'effects', '34', 'Odd', 'Thomas', '34', 'are', 'actually', 'close', 'par', 'blockbusters', 'comparison', 'CGI', 'seen', 'today', ""'re"", 'tiny', 'bit', 'aged', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'only', 'noticeable', 'digital', 'creatures', 'are', 'bodachs', 'actually', 'look', 'heck', 'lot', 'better', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'did', '34', 'Mummy', 'Returns.', '34', '34', 'Odd', 'Thomas', '34', ""n't"", 'rated', 'include', 'violence', 'gore', 'adult', 'situations', 'language', 'intents', 'purposes', 'should', 'hold', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'most', 'nothing', 'too', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'included.I', 'felt', '34', 'Odd', 'Thomas', '34', 'reflected', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'well', 'character', 'how', 'Heaven', 'bodachs', 'are', 'obviously', 'demonic', 'forces', 'are', 'attracted', 'evil', 'much', 'fallen', 'angels', 'read', 'Bible', 'Odd', 'also', 'killer', 'victims', ""'re"", 'going', 'better', 'place', 'dissolve', 'glittering', 'dust', 'flowers', 'float', 'off', ""'ve"", 'made', 'peace.', '34', 'Odd', 'Thomas', '34', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'financial', 'backing', 'what', 'found', 'movie', 'charming', 'gleefully', 'campy', 'places', 'ripe', 'entry', 'series', 'one', 'can', 'just', 'pay', 'back', 'budget', 'not', 'often', 'Dean', 'Koontz', 'liked', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'books', 'actually', 'one.', '34', ""'m"", 'just', 'happy', 'never', 'know', 'anything', 'going', 'be', 'success', 'not', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'rest', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', '[', 'movies', ']', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'first', 'time', '34', 'Koontz', 'told', 'website', 'io9', 'anyone', 'book', 'was', 'adapted', 'correctly', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'author', 'created', 'world', 'characters', 'still', 'think', 'would', 'work', 'great', 'weekly', 'TV', 'series', ""'ll"", 'settle', 'movie', 'year']",N/A

The initial book is dear to my heart, because the character of Odd...as written...is so endearing, quirky and heroic; we learn how he came to be such a person.

I just loved the relationship between Odd, Ozzie and Chester (the cat!) in the novel, but Ozzie is reduced to this casual character in Odd's life with all of a sixty second appearance in the film. As others have mentioned, the ghost of Elvis was a frequent companion of Odd's and added such a bittersweet aspect to the story as well.I certainly understand the reasons a novel can cover so much more detail, as opposed to the film version, but I felt a much better job could have been done. If I hadn't read the novel, I would have probably enjoyed the film much more, but instead ended up missing seeing SO MUCH of what made the story special to me.I do feel Anton Yelchin did an excellent job as Odd.

This movie feels like a TV movie--the sort they put out when they hope to make a television series from it.  It is basically a good adaption to the book, which I have read.  They did change the story--if my memory is correct--about Odd Thomas's mother.  They didn't go into Stormy's issues.Other than that, it basically followed the plot line.  The guy that plays Odd was pretty decent, though he was more cutesy in the way Michael J. Fox was when he was young.  I always pictured Odd being more of a nerdy version of Billy Bob Thornton.

1689677,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B00HHYF570,Israel Drazin,"[0, 1]","This will be, I think, an enjoyable film even for people who have not read the seven Odd Thomas novels or who know nothing about &#8220;magical realism.&#8221; The main character, Odd Thomas, is a young man that people will like.I read most of Dean Koontz&#8217;s books and all seven of his Odd Thomas books as well as his Odd Thomas graphic novels and enjoyed them all. I thought that the film would be disappointing even as the Edgar R. Burroughs film &#8220;Princess of Mars,&#8221; which I saw earlier this week, was a disappointment. It was not similar to the book and not enjoyable. It depicted both the main character and Mars very unlike what the famed writer Burroughs created. I thought the film was below a grade B film. But this did not happen with Odd Thomas. The film caught the spirit of Koontz&#8217;s creation and was true to its plot. Even the actors reflected the book&#8217;s character and although Koontz did not write the script the language was his.Dean Koontz is a best-selling author of over sixty novels. He frequently writes tales with &#8220;magical realism,&#8221; as he does with Odd Thomas. This genre was used with perfection by many other writers, especially South Americans, and also by Nobel Prize Winners Shmuel Yosef Agnon (1888-1970, winner in 1966) and Gabriel Garcia Marques (1927-2014, winner in 1982).&#8220;Magical realism&#8221; combines facts with fantasy. An example from one of Agnon&#8217;s stories is a man who was left behind accidently by his companions who were sailing on a ship; they saw him floating on a carpet on the ship&#8217;s side, not missing the trip and reaching their destination. Another example is seeing a man crossing a bridge; he begins by walking across, but soon he is seen elevated above the ground and floating to the bridge&#8217;s end. These fantastic descriptions add a dimension to the tale and can cause readers to think how they want to interpret the account.

So, seeing who the director was (Mummy and Mummy 2), loving the Dean Koontz books - ALL of them! - and recognizing the star from a Terminator movie and (I believe) the Fright Night remake, I decided to try it.Now, it's been quite a while since I first read Odd Thomas. so I can't be absolutely sure it remained absolutely faithful to the book, but it had to come awfully close as I recognized most of the characters and the parts they played.  I think the male lead (no, I can't remember his name!) did an excellent job.  I had a small problem with the written character because he was just a little too polite and mild for my liking, and the character in the movie didn't come off quite as milquetoast.  He was still very nice and polite and sweet, but had a slightly rougher edge that was more realistic and I liked it.I kept hoping that they might change the ending as the one in the book made me sad, but I warned my son what might be coming and come it did - which didn't make him happy, but it did stay true to the book.  We really loved both of the Stormy characters- the written and the portrayed.  The actress did a great job.Willem Dafoe was - as usual - terrific.  He played the police chief extremely well as he does just about everyone he brings to life.I would say, even if you've never read the books, you will like the movie.

No pun intentionally intended...  :-)  Yes, there were parts left out, (shucks, another unintentional pun) but it would take a mini-series to effectively cover the entire 1st book & a TV series to cover the rest of the Odd books. Absolutely delighted w/Anton Yelchin's portrayal of Odd Thomas. In my mind, he fits my mental picture of Odd perfectly. As does Addison Timlin's Stormy. Both just lovely. The creepy bodachs were well, even creepier than I imagined; the special effects of the house from hell, definitely worked for me.

This is especially hard with a cast of mostly unknown actors and actresses, and a setting out in the middle of nowhere.  Yet this box office flop is quite a good movie, and for Anton Yelchin, provided a great leading role to follow-up on his supporting roles in two Star Trek blockbusters.  Coming out in early 2014 to little fanfare, this film tries to ride the coattails of the numerous superhero franchises by portraying a simple man who works as a short order cook, while occasionally using his ability to see dead people to help solve crimes.  The titular character, Odd Thomas, narrates the film as it progresses, occasionally breaking the fourth wall by telling us, the audience, about his skills, how they complicate his life, and how he uses them.  Over the course of the film, he uses his ability to see spirits to prevent a horrendous crime, but at great personal cost, which defines the tragedy of the plot.  The romance in the movie is between Odd Thomas and his girlfriend, a waitress at a mall ice cream shop; a romance whose ending is the ultimate expression of Odd's powers.

Having read the novels, I was curious as to how the story would translate to the screen. Anton Yelchin (whose name sounds as if he should play a Slavic spy instead of this young adult role) is perfect as Odd. In appearance, he's a normal young man, fairly nerdish perhaps than how one would consider looking like a psychic but he's both. Odd sees dead people and proceeds to discover who killed them and bring the killers to justice. In fact the only thing blatantly odd about him is his devotion to his girlfriend Stormy whom he has loved &#34;forever.&#34;  He lives in the little California town of Pico Mundo (which unfortunately in the end-shots looks suspiciously like the Southwest where it was actually filmed) by himself since his father is off chasing dreams and his mother resides in a mental institution because she apparently couldn't handle her own visions.  The local police chief is aware of Odd's visions and somehow manages to keep quiet his involvement in all the incidents.We are introduced to Odd as he's diverted from going to his job a a fry cook by the ghost of a recently killed girl who leads him to her murderer. Thus first off, we're shown how dedicated Odd is to getting justice for the dead, as well as the dangers to him because of the bodachs, huge insect-like creatures attracted to evil. They aren't aware Odd can see them and will kill him if they learn. Since they're hovering in swarms around a specific person, Odd tries to determine exactly what the man is up to...and thereby hangs this tale.As far as I'm concerned, Yelchin is perfect in the role, as are all other cast members.  There are little changes here and there in plot and characters, but when has a novel ever come to the screen perfectly intact? It's a fairly leisurely film but don't take that to mean it drags; it simply takes its time, setting up everything before getting into action. Quirky in spots, blackly humorous in others, the romance between Odd and Stormy who knows of his &#34;gift&#34; and understands him better than any other, is a lovely little gem in the midst of his turmoil, keeping Odd grounded and well-adjusted to his life.

He can also see &#8220;bodachs,&#8221; something like evil spirits that foreshadow death. And today Odd notices there are so many of them in the town. Something terrible is going to happen, but how can he stop that?Despite several twists and turns, the storyline itself is pretty simple. The entire tone of the film is whimsical, jumping from thriller to comedy. What makes the film work is obviously the excellent performances from the stars Anton Yelchin as Odd, and Addison Timlin as his lovely girlfriend Stormy Llewellyn working in an ice cream shop. Their chemistry is genuine.The film, based on a Dean Koontz novel, is written and directed by Stephen Sommers known for &#8220;The Mummy.&#8221; And like &#8220;The Mummy,&#8221; special effects are impressive, especially those of bodachs.

While I remember only snippets of the book's plot, I recall even now that I thoroughly enjoyed it and I adored Odd. So I couldn't wait to see this, though I was a bit nervous. How well could they capture Odd's essence on film?Very well, much to my relief. Odd is as charming, quirky, and downright lovable a character on film as in the book. Stormy is pretty spot-on as well, though there were a few quick snippets of dialogue that felt rather contrived.  Despite this, their relationship and love for each other was very believable, and they were easily likeable characters. I also enjoyed seeing William Dafoe in this one- he's the only actor I recognized, but everyone was well-cast and the acting was good-to-great. No big duds stinking up the film.The special effects were terrific, and I didn't notice any dead spots that felt like filler. A particular scene in the book that got a bigger-than-usual emotional reaction out of me evoked the same in the movie, even though I already anticipated it this time around.

1689855,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B00HHYF570,Wayne C. Rogers,"[0, 0]","Now, I&#8217;ve been an avid fan of the book series by Dean Koontz since the first novel was published in 2003.  When I first heard a film was being made Odd Thomas and that Stephen Sommers was directing it, I was as excited with anticipation.  I mean Stephen Sommers was the director of The Mummy and The Mummy 2, which are movies I certainly enjoyed.  Of course, I knew the success of Odd Thomas would depend largely on what actor played the lead role and who played his soul mate, Stormy Llewellyn.  If the actors portraying these two characters got it right, then it was a natural assumption the rest the film would follow suit.Anton Yelchin was picked for Odd Thomas and it&#8217;s perfect casting in my opinion.  He manages to capture the soul, the humor and the essence of Odd very quickly.  The role of his girlfriend, Stormy, was played by Addison Timlin, who surprised me with her ability to win me over.  I didn&#8217;t really know of her until this film, and I swiftly came to the conclusion that she was ideal as Stormy.  This is definitely a woman any man would fall in love with.  Rounding out the main cast is Willem Dafoe as Police Chief Wyatt Porter and Patton Oswalt as Odd&#8217;s best friend, Ozzie Boone.For those of you who haven&#8217;t read the novel, or seen the movie, the story centers around Odd Thomas, who&#8217;s a short-order cook in a small caf&eacute; in the town of Pico Mundo, which is located somewhere in the desert of central California.  Odd also has psychic powers that he uses to help the local police in nabbing dangerous criminals.  When a stranger arrives in town, surrounded by dozens of spirits (bodachs) that only Odd can see, the short-order cook realizes that something terribly bad is about to happen.Odd starts following the bizarre man around and soon discovers that his personality is totally evil.  Even worse, the guy has friends in Pico Mundo, and all of them are planning to do something catastrophic that will literally kill hundreds of people.  Odd has to figure out what the calamity will be so he can stop it.The movie is well acted and filmed with excellent special effects.  Unfortunately for me, I had to view this movie twice in order to appreciate its higher qualities.  Many people have preferred to the film as a comedy, but I saw it as somewhat of a lighthearted story with a very serious theme.  In fact, the second time I watched it, I had no expectations and therefore, could simply enjoy it for what the movie was: a very entertaining film.  It&#8217;s the best adaptation of a Dean Koontz novel I&#8217;ve ever seen, and even though I knew what was going to happen at the end, I still found myself tearing up.The regular DVD of Odd Thomas had absolutely no Special Features on it.  No commentary, no behind-the-scenes stuff, no interviews with the performers or the director, or on the making of the film.  I don&#8217;t know who put the DVD out, but it looks as though they didn&#8217;t want to spend any more money than necessary on getting this movie out to the general public.  This was a shame.  If ever a good movie needed the director and actors discussing what happened to the film and why it went straight to video, it&#8217;s this one.  An interview with Dean Koontz would also have been nice.All in all, I have to give this movie a high recommendation.  It&#8217;s one I definitely want to watch a third time.",5,This film needs to be watched more than once to thoroughly enjoy it.,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,3396,"['Now', '8217', 'been', 'avid', 'fan', 'book', 'series', 'Dean', 'Koontz', 'first', 'novel', 'was', 'published', '2003', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'Odd', 'Thomas', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'was', 'directing', 'was', 'excited', 'anticipation', 'mean', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'was', 'director', 'Mummy', 'Mummy', '2', 'are', 'movies', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'course', 'knew', 'success', 'Odd', 'Thomas', 'would', 'depend', 'largely', 'what', 'actor', 'played', 'lead', 'role', 'who', 'played', 'soul', 'mate', 'Stormy', 'Llewellyn', 'actors', 'portraying', 'two', 'characters', 'got', 'right', 'then', 'was', 'natural', 'assumption', 'rest', 'film', 'would', 'follow', 'suit.Anton', 'Yelchin', 'was', 'picked', 'Odd', 'Thomas', '8217', 'perfect', 'casting', 'opinion', 'capture', 'soul', 'humor', 'essence', 'Odd', 'very', 'quickly', 'role', 'girlfriend', 'Stormy', 'was', 'played', 'Addison', 'Timlin', 'who', 'surprised', 'ability', 'win', 'didn', '8217', 'really', 'know', 'film', 'swiftly', 'came', 'conclusion', 'was', 'ideal', 'Stormy', 'definitely', 'woman', 'man', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'Rounding', 'out', 'main', 'cast', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Wyatt', 'Porter', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'Odd', '8217', 'best', 'friend', 'Ozzie', 'Boone.For', 'who', 'haven', '8217', 'read', 'novel', 'seen', 'movie', 'story', 'centers', 'Odd', 'Thomas', 'who', '8217', 's', 'short-order', 'cook', 'small', 'caf', 'eacute', 'town', 'Pico', 'Mundo', 'located', 'somewhere', 'desert', 'central', 'California', 'Odd', 'also', 'psychic', 'powers', 'help', 'local', 'police', 'nabbing', 'dangerous', 'criminals', 'When', 'stranger', 'town', 'surrounded', 'dozens', 'spirits', 'bodachs', 'only', 'Odd', 'can', 'see', 'short-order', 'cook', 'something', 'terribly', 'bad', 'happen.Odd', 'starts', 'following', 'bizarre', 'man', 'soon', 'discovers', 'personality', 'totally', 'evil', 'Even', 'worse', 'guy', 'friends', 'Pico', 'Mundo', 'are', 'planning', 'do', 'something', 'catastrophic', 'will', 'literally', 'kill', 'hundreds', 'people', 'Odd', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'calamity', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'can', 'stop', 'it.The', 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'filmed', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'view', 'movie', 'twice', 'order', 'appreciate', 'higher', 'qualities', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'preferred', 'film', 'comedy', 'saw', 'somewhat', 'lighthearted', 'story', 'very', 'serious', 'theme', 'fact', 'second', 'time', 'watched', 'had', 'expectations', 'therefore', 'could', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', '8217', 'best', 'adaptation', 'Dean', 'Koontz', 'novel', '8217', 'ever', 'seen', 'even', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'end', 'still', 'found', 'tearing', 'up.The', 'regular', 'DVD', 'Odd', 'Thomas', 'had', 'absolutely', 'Special', 'Features', 'commentary', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stuff', 'interviews', 'performers', 'director', 'making', 'film', 'don', '8217', 't', 'know', 'who', 'put', 'DVD', 'out', 'didn', '8217', 'want', 'spend', 'more', 'money', 'necessary', 'getting', 'movie', 'general', 'public', 'was', 'shame', 'ever', 'good', 'movie', 'needed', 'director', 'actors', 'discussing', 'what', 'happened', 'film', 'why', 'went', 'straight', 'video', '8217', 'one', 'interview', 'Dean', 'Koontz', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'nice.All', 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'high', 'recommendation', '8217', 'one', 'definitely', 'want', 'watch', 'third', 'time']",N/A

A pretty interesting story with a main character who has neat powers.  But it just falls short in so many scenes.The characters in this movie act like they have been trapped in a Nickelodeon kid's show for the bulk of their lives.  In a horror/thriller that should be taken seriously--especially considering that there are demonic monsters everywhere--the good characters are spouting the lamest dialogue I have ever heard.  It's all a joke to these people.  They call each other cute and cuddly names like 3rd graders in love.  Just weird, distracting, and a complete destruction of suspension of disbelief.There is a great action scene in the beginning where Odd catches a child murderer.  From their on it goes downhill.If you LOVE Dean Koontz (the author of the book of the same title) that much, you should probably give it a try.  If you are looking for a serious supernatural thriller, this one is off the table.",2,Potentially Good Movie Ruined By Childish Dialogue,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,1039,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'Now', 'am', 'glad', 'have', ""n't"", 'movie', 'had', 'such', 'potential', 'Great', 'acting', 'Mediocre', 'effects', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'neat', 'powers', 'just', 'short', 'so', 'many', 'scenes.The', 'characters', 'movie', 'act', 'have', 'been', 'trapped', 'Nickelodeon', 'kid', 'show', 'bulk', 'lives', 'horror/thriller', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'especially', 'considering', 'are', 'demonic', 'monsters', 'everywhere', 'good', 'characters', 'are', 'spouting', 'lamest', 'dialogue', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'joke', 'people', 'call', 'other', 'cute', 'cuddly', 'names', '3rd', 'graders', 'love', 'Just', 'weird', 'distracting', 'complete', 'destruction', 'suspension', 'disbelief.There', 'great', 'action', 'scene', 'beginning', 'where', 'Odd', 'child', 'murderer', 'downhill.If', 'LOVE', 'Dean', 'Koontz', 'author', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'much', 'should', 'probably', 'give', 'try', 'are', 'looking', 'serious', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'one', 'table']",N/A
