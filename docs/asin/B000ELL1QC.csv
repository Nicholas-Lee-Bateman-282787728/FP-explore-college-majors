974039,A2F7CCPK4QL359,B000ELL1QC,"Bennet Pomerantz ""Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD""","[10, 11]","Here goes another well told series cut out before its prime. Odyssey 5 was a Shotime series (you know the network that gave you a show like Fat Actress and Stargate SG1, this show was inbetween). Showtime cut the Odyseey show short by give the run of 19 episodes.For its maiden and only season, Odyseey combined a time travel premous with an end of the world ideal(these five people from the shuttle Odyssey were put back on earth five before it imploded to find out why it was and try to stop it). It works well as a good SF series, it does not dwell as million of Special efects like a Star Trek or Battlestar would, it dwells within  the human emotions that movies this series...I think this is one of the reasons that this series fail to find an audience. It  also foreshadowed items that would or coulkd be used in the show's season season which never came to pass..too badThe casting of Peter Weller as the mission Odyssey commander was  brillant. He isnt a epic hero in the sense like Robocop (which he played in two movies), he is a frailer down to earth man. With this role, you dont need an epic hero type like James T. Kirk. Note this show is a polar opposite from Star Trek in its scopeThere is an audio commentary track of the pilot episode with Producer Manny Moto and Peter Weller which gives an insite to what may have happened in future seasons if the show was to continueDAMN Showtime and the Sci-FI channel! for Showtime, This was an educated smart series that should have been given a chance to grow, so do another FAT ACTRESS please.  For Sci-Fi Channel, Odyssey would have worked in your Schedule with Stargate SG1 which is the OLDEST RUNNING SCIENCE FICTION  series on TV (and note was started on SHOWTIME Network)and the Emmy nominated and critic loved  BattleStar Gallatica remakeIf you want a smart series, get this DVD set.

974044,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,B000ELL1QC,Danny G.,"[55, 61]","This is absolutley one of the best series I have ever seen in my 40 years of watching television! It's obvious why the executives at Showtime paniced: The show was way too subversive for a politically conservative medium like cable t.v.! The political and philosphical statements Odyssey 5 were literally making in each episode were just too much for the spineless creatures that rule the cable airwaves!My favorite genre is science fiction & fantasy. I have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly over the years. Nothing, except for Star Trek, Farscape and Babylon 5 comes close to the genius and passion of Odyssey 5! I can think of few television series where I cared so much for each main character, or the extensive range of emotions felt. The series was like theater! There's no other way to describe it!Had those responsible at Showtime kept Corporate at bay, instead of canceling the series literally in mid-sentence, the eventual controversey Odyssey 5 might have generated would've been good for business!The only drawback the series had was the importance of watching each episode in sequence. But with all the recording technology now available, this minor obstacle would not have been very difficult to overcome!The loss to science fiction was incalcuable by the obnoxious cancelation of this unique series. Perhaps, someone soon will have the courage to pick up the pieces and write a book, or make a movie, and finish the series with the same amount of passion and subversiveness as the creators of Odyssey 5 did!

974045,A3DP1Q9EOK2R1,B000ELL1QC,Grady Miller,"[10, 14]","That Showtime kept Jeremiah and cancelled O-5 stuns me to this day, obviously some political move on the backend was the reason for the demise of this instand classic.  No one I know who watched it didn't love it.  Peter Weller was amazing, as was the rest of the cast, and the arcing storyline was brilliant to the end, which, sadly, was not the conclusion.  To add insult to injury, they left us with a huge cliffhanger that will likley never be resolved.  Actors from O-5 have moved on to other projects, so chances are we will never find out if the crew of Odyssey 5 will save the Earth from complete destruction.  The only thing keeping me from buying this DVD set is the lack of a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th season to complement it.  As it stands, it's a brilliant peak into a story that deserved to make it through to the end.  Seeing Manny Coto get bounced to the mediocre-to-awful Star Trek: Enterprise only makes it worse, since O-5 was the kind of show that makes all Trek seem cheap and unoriginal.  At some point, I'm sure I thought seeing them release O-5 on DVD would be a good thing, but now that it's going to happen, it only feels like a hollow slap in the face to those who enjoyed it.",5,One of the best shows ever cancelled,1142985600,"03 22, 2006",2006,1200,"['Showtime', 'kept', 'Jeremiah', 'cancelled', 'O-5', 'stuns', 'day', 'obviously', 'political', 'move', 'backend', 'was', 'reason', 'demise', 'instand', 'classic', 'one', 'know', 'who', 'watched', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'was', 'amazing', 'was', 'rest', 'cast', 'arcing', 'storyline', 'was', 'brilliant', 'end', 'sadly', 'was', 'not', 'conclusion', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'left', 'huge', 'cliffhanger', 'will', 'likley', 'never', 'be', 'resolved', 'Actors', 'O-5', 'have', 'moved', 'other', 'projects', 'chances', 'are', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'crew', 'Odyssey', '5', 'will', 'save', 'Earth', 'complete', 'destruction', 'only', 'thing', 'keeping', 'buying', 'DVD', 'set', 'lack', '2nd', '3rd', '4th', '5th', 'season', 'complement', 'brilliant', 'peak', 'story', 'deserved', 'make', 'end', 'Seeing', 'Manny', 'Coto', 'get', 'bounced', 'mediocre-to-awful', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'only', 'worse', 'O-5', 'was', 'kind', 'show', 'Trek', 'seem', 'cheap', 'unoriginal', 'point', ""'m"", 'sure', 'thought', 'seeing', 'release', 'O-5', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'now', 'going', 'happen', 'only', 'hollow', 'slap', 'face', 'who', 'enjoyed']",Odyssey 5 - The Complete Series

This show could have easily gone on another year...it seems like they were trying for a five year series but that would have been overkill.

(space is only in the first episode +/- and repeated on every intro)It uses limited sets in the production (must have been a low cost production) Not quite as bad as ""Archie Bunker"" they did some how get some real NASA footage (cool) but not very move like (you got to edit the footage dude!).The episodes don't flow together, nor are they a good series of events.  Just events, +/- connected.OK wow what is it:It is the odd 5 (They are not the best actors ""in my Opinion"") (their characters could never have made it into NASA ""other than for PR"" let alone on to a shuttle) but hey there they are. You might have to stretch to see this is possible (hell it is SYFI+/-)step one: while doing dumb stuff on the shuttle the planet blows up below them ( I did like the compact car flying by them! but again not going to happen)a alien (if you did not figure it out was an AI) sends there consciousness back 5 years so they could prevent the earth from blowing up.For the folks that thought this was a cliff hanger (""They did not succeed, else how could they have been sent back"") one of those chicken and egg thought issues. But could have been resolved with a dream (But the writers were not there, hell the show was not there)In any case the rest of the soap opera consists of a ""dinner scene"" (i.e. cheap production) in every episode / some action to stop computer AI entities on the internet from destroying the world. and that is about it. Oh the AI on earth make fake people that are colder than real people they are suppose to be.Things I grew to hate! I do mean hate! as I sat through most of the episodes (Petter Wellers voice)  not sure what it is, but it becomes like scratching on a  chalk board. (The lack of any real characters or there development)You can watch any episode in any order and it makes sense +/- so if you start in the middle you are about the same spot as if you start at the end.There may be some plot but it is not that great (I am guessing they tried to sell a second season to pull it together) did not work for the network guys nor did I see it working for me.

974061,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000ELL1QC,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[146, 151]","An intelligent well written series that was cancelled too soon ""Odyssey 5"" only ran one season on Showtime before the network in its infinite wisdom (much as the Sci-Fi Channel did with ""Farscape"") to pull the plug before writer/creator/producer Manny Coto had a chance to resolve the story. Coto went on to revive ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" surprising the best two seasons of that show and providing one of the most compelling story arcs ""Enterprise"" had. He's since gone on to co-producer and writer ""24"". Even without its resolution ""Odyssey 5"" is a worthwhile show to watch. Working on a shoestring budget compared to most shows Coto managed to produce a number of intelligent episodes with some outstanding acting and effects work. Although the DVD set lacks the powerhouse extras we see on some releases it does include a terrific commentary track on the pilot episode with Manny Cotto and Peter Weller providing the play-by-play on the shooting of the show and unshot episodes.While completing a routine mission to service a satellite the crew of the Space Shuttle Odyssey 5 Commander Chuck Taggart (Peter Well), biologist Kurt Mendel (Sebastian Roch?), Neil Taggart (Christopher Gorham), astronaut Angela Perry (Tamara Craig Thomas) and TV newscaster Sara Forbes witness the implosion of the Earth. Suddenly the human race with the exception of these five individuals has been wiped out. Running out of oxygen and with no options the crew wait for their end aboard the Space Shuttle. They're saved by an alien who calls himself the Seeker (John Neville ""Baron Munchausen"" and ""The X-Files"") whose own world was also wiped out by a mysterious force referred to as Leviathan. It seems the Seeker has been trying to contact other intelligent species for 300 years but each time he arrives it's the same-the world has been destroyed with all its inhabitants. The Odyssey 5 crew are the first survivors he's run into and he offers them the hope of averting Earth's destruction by sending their consciousness 5 years into the past so they can unravel who and what was behind the Earth's destruction.While some episodes of the show could be a bit routine (for example the one where the crew begin losing their memory had a lot of potential but fails to deliver)the overall quality of the show was extremely high with intelligent scripts that dealt with difficult ethical and moral issues within a science fiction frame work. For example the series frequently deals with the impact when the crew tries to change tragic or difficult events in their own past and how things don't quite work out the way they had planned. Overall the show had much promise and I'm hoping that Coto returns to the show again either in a TV mini-series format (hopefully with the original cast) or film to resolve the cliffhanging conclusion of the show.Sony has provided us with ""Odyssey 5"" on five dual layered single sided discs. Although there's some minor digital artifacts overall the show looks splendid. With sharp, bold colors and a strong 5.1 mix. The dialogue is clear and crisp while direction effects are particularly nice during the pilot episode.While short on special features the show is presented as it aired on Showtime not the version that was broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel. Manny Coto and Peter Weller provide an intelligent perceptive commentary track on the two hour pilot episode. It's a pity that Sony chose not to have them do a commentary track on any of the other episodes but I'm grateful that we got some extras with this set. I'm sure that Showtime probably had a behind-the-scenes featurette that they aired prior to the show's premiere but Sony would probably have to license that from Showtime. The price for the 19 episodes is a bit steep (but not out of line with other shows of its type) however given the excellent transfer, 5.1 mix and commentary track it's worth it. Coto doesn't share how the series was going to conclude in the commentary track as he has hopes that he might be able to revive the concept for a made for cable movie (Sci-Fi this is your chance to make up for screwing the pooch when you cancelled ""Farscape"") or a series of movies. I'm hoping that he can pull it all together as this series (and its fans) deserves to have a resolution worthy of its intriguing concept.A terrific show that certainly deserved better treatment than it received from Showtime (hey if Showtime can keep on some of the trash they've committed to over the years they certainly should have lived up to the commitment to allow Coto to close out the series), ""Odyssey 5"" may frustrate a few fans because it doesn't have a resolution but the show's terrific writing and acting make this a worthwhile show to pick up for science fiction fans. I knew there was a good reason why I cancelled Showtime.So why not 5 stars? The transfer is exceptional (5 stars) with great 5.1 audio. The show deserves it but without a resolution and only 1 extra (Manny Coto and Peter Weller's commentary track which is exceptional)the set gets four stars. Hopefully Coto can convince the Sci-Fi Channel (which ran the series recently) to spring for a six hour minin-series to tie up the loose ends much like ""Farscape"" (a show that Sci-Fi idiotically cancelled and then returned to for the concluding mini-series).",4,Exceptional series cut down by the idiots at Showtime,1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,5302,"['intelligent', 'well', 'written',
