When he isn't dectecting, he's home listening to Wagner or Turandot on the phonograph and drinking whisky. On duty, he may often be found having a pint of dark bitter at a pub with Sgt. Lewis (Kevin Whately). Morse does have his problems with the opposite sex, however. He meets attractive women left and right, but they always seem to have a dark secret. Sooner or later, he is embroiled in their problems.In THE DEAD OF JERICHO, Morse encounters the lovely Anne Stavely (Gemma Jones, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY) a fellow member of an Oxford community choir. One evening after choir rehearsal, Anne invites Morse back to her new flat in the recently gentrified Jericho section of Oxford. One thing leads to another, and soon Morse discovers Anne has troubling secrets she won't share with him.The day of the choir concert, Anne does not show up. Morse drives to her flat only to discover Thames Valley Police SOCO (Scene of crime officers) at hand. Who killed the victim, or was it suicide? Who was the young man staying with Anne who kept a copy of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; beside his bed? And what about the nosy neighbor--did he see something he should tell the police? Morse soon steps into sticky ethical waters as he is no longer a disinterested bystander. His difficulties grow more complex by the hour as he discovers death, backmail, and other illicit activities in Jericho--all involving Anne.This is an excellent DVD and a good recording of the original TV show. My DVD has a little documentary of the &quot;Making of Morse&quot; showing locations around Oxford.

It began in 1991 and starred the now deceased award-winning actor John Thaw. This DVD is the first episode.Morse is an iconoclastic heterodox cop. He follows his own ideas tenaciously and is generally, but not always successful. He uses no first name. He is a heavy drinker, morning, afternoon, and night, especially good beer. He enjoys classical music and singing immensely. He drives a beautiful red car that is involved in two crashes in this film. He is never successful in romance, as shown in this first as well as some later films. His superior officers recognize his usual successes, but he is passed over for promotions because of his investigative methods. Sergeant Lewis begins to work for him during this adventure and remains his frequently overworked sidekick throughout the series.Morse meets a beautiful woman who sings with him in a chorus. He is attracted to her and tells her. He dates her a couple of times, when she tells him that she is involved with another man in a strange relationship. Morse mumbles that it was too good to be true. She is found hanging. The police think, but are unsure, that this was a suicide, but no suicide note is found. Although it is not his case, Morse investigates the matter. He develops an unusual theory of suicide involving the Greek classic play by Sophocles Oedipus the King.

Seeing how the characters and their relationships were introduced and begun to be developed is helpful to me as I now catch-up with the rest of my Morse education.The accompanying documentary, ""The Mystery of Morse,"" is very well done--informative, funny, and poignant in places. John Thaw speaks eloquently on how he got into acting in the first place, the character of Morse that comes through him, and the price of fame (always feeling he is being watched). He makes it clear that there was always an emphasis on keeping the character of Morse (slightly morose and wonderfully eccentric) at the center of each Morse episode.It's that emphasis on character that deepens this effort at sleuthing the secrets of death--and life.--Janet Grace Riehl, author Sightlines: A Poet's Diary",5,Enduring and Endearing,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,886,"['appreciated', 'seeing', 'first', 'episode', 'long-running', 'series', 'adapting', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'fine', 'novels', 'Seeing', 'how', 'characters', 'relationships', 'were', 'introduced', 'begun', 'be', 'developed', 'helpful', 'now', 'catch-up', 'rest', 'Morse', 'education.The', 'accompanying', 'documentary', 'Mystery', 'Morse', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'informative', 'funny', 'poignant', 'places', 'John', 'Thaw', 'eloquently', 'how', 'got', 'acting', 'first', 'place', 'character', 'Morse', 'price', 'fame', 'always', 'feeling', 'being', 'watched', 'clear', 'was', 'always', 'emphasis', 'keeping', 'character', 'Morse', 'slightly', 'morose', 'wonderfully', 'eccentric', 'center', 'Morse', 'episode.It', 'emphasis', 'character', 'effort', 'sleuthing', 'secrets', 'death', 'life.', 'Janet', 'Grace', 'Riehl', 'author', 'Sightlines', 'Poet', 'Diary']",N/A

570714,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B000056T4S,Mary Whipple,"[6, 6]","The Dead of Jericho, the first episode of the video series of Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse, gets the series off to a roaring start!  Filled with local color, an atmosphere of intimacy, wonderful photography, and the best music ever for a mystery series (choral, piano, and opera selections), it completely involves the reader in the action and stimulates interest in the lives of Inspector Morse and Sgt. Lewis. The talented John Thaw, as Inspector Morse, is a man who is passionately interested in music, crossword puzzles, and beer at the pub, but he is also interested in finding a woman who shares his interests.  In this episode, he has made the acquaintance of Anne Stavely, a woman who sings in his chorale and whom he would like to get to know better.Anne, however, has a painful past history, and she is reluctant to begin a relationship with Morse.  Before Morse finds our more about this, however, Anne Stavely is found hanging in her apartment.  Several plots unwind simultaneously as Morse investigates Anne's death and tries to find who might have wanted to kill her.  A neighbor has been peeping through the window at her;  her boss's wife suspects he has been having an affair with Anne; a young druggie with money problems steals money from Anne.  The producers, however, let the threads develop on their own, leaving the action unclear at first and forcing the viewer to become involved and draw conclusions about how or whether these plot lines may be connected.This series changes the character of Morse and Sgt. Lewis from the book, where Morse is actually younger than Lewis, and Lewis is more adept at police procedure.  Here Lewis (Kevin Whately) is the perfect foil to Thaw's Morse, less educated and proud of it and willing to do the leg work for Morse.  In this episode, Morse is actually a candidate for police superintendent, with Inspector Bell as his rival.  Max, the coroner, makes an appearance and highlights Morse's queasy stomach in the face of bloodshed and death.  Elegantly produced, with wonderful on-location shots of Oxford neighborhoods and homes, the series starts with a terrific mystery, involving a woman Morse cares for and develops in surprising, dramatic ways.  A worthy debut for a terrific series!  n  Mary Whipple",5,"With this as the first episode, it's no wonder the series was such a hit!",1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,2268,"['Dead', 'Jericho', 'first', 'episode', 'video', 'series', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'series', 'roaring', 'start', 'Filled', 'local', 'color', 'atmosphere', 'intimacy', 'wonderful', 'photography', 'best', 'music', 'ever', 'mystery', 'series', 'choral', 'piano', 'opera', 'selections', 'completely', 'reader', 'action', 'interest', 'lives', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'Sgt', 'Lewis', 'talented', 'John', 'Thaw', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'man', 'who', 'passionately', 'interested', 'music', 'crossword', 'puzzles', 'beer', 'pub', 'also', 'interested', 'finding', 'woman', 'who', 'shares', 'interests', 'episode', 'made', 'acquaintance', 'Anne', 'Stavely', 'woman', 'who', 'chorale', 'whom', 'would', 'like', 'get', 'know', 'better.Anne', 'however', 'painful', 'past', 'history', 'reluctant', 'begin', 'relationship', 'Morse', 'Morse', 'more', 'however', 'Anne', 'Stavely', 'found', 'hanging', 'apartment', 'Several', 'plots', 'unwind', 'simultaneously', 'Morse', 'Anne', 'death', 'tries', 'find', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'wanted', 'kill', 'neighbor', 'been', 'peeping', 'window', 'boss', 'wife', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'Anne', 'young', 'druggie', 'money', 'problems', 'steals', 'money', 'Anne', 'producers', 'however', 'let', 'threads', 'develop', 'own', 'leaving', 'action', 'unclear', 'first', 'forcing', 'viewer', 'become', 'involved', 'draw', 'conclusions', 'how', 'plot', 'lines', 'may', 'be', 'connected.This', 'series', 'character', 'Morse', 'Sgt', 'Lewis', 'book', 'where', 'Morse', 'actually', 'younger', 'Lewis', 'Lewis', 'more', 'adept', 'police', 'procedure', 'Here', 'Lewis', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Thaw', 'Morse', 'less', 'educated', 'proud', 'willing', 'do', 'leg', 'work', 'Morse', 'episode', 'Morse', 'actually', 'candidate', 'police', 'superintendent', 'Inspector', 'Bell', 'rival', 'Max', 'coroner', 'appearance', 'highlights', 'Morse', 'queasy', 'stomach', 'face', 'bloodshed', 'death', 'Elegantly', 'produced', 'wonderful', 'on-location', 'shots', 'Oxford', 'neighborhoods', 'homes', 'series', 'terrific', 'mystery', 'involving', 'woman', 'Morse', 'develops', 'surprising', 'dramatic', 'ways', 'worthy', 'debut', 'terrific', 'series', 'n', 'Mary', 'Whipple']",N/A

Viewers also become acquainted with Morse's tendency to fail at forming lasting relationships with women.  As an introductory mystery, this entry in the series is good, but not spectacular.  For example, a blackmailer is murdered, even though the reason for this drastic measure is not completely clear or convincing--- since the wife of the person being blackmailed already knows the relevant salacious details.  Additionally, Sergeant Lewis displays at least one behavior which was inconsistent with the development of his personality/character in the later episodes.  Lewis, always something of a moralistic Boy Scout at heart, commits an act of doubtful legality (without the slightest protest) by willingly searching offices without a warrant and without the permission of the occupants.

I lived the series, and I was so sad to see it end. I had read several of the books by Colin Dexter in the series, and, now, after all these years, I have seen the first.John Thaw was an actor of high acclaim. He starred as the melancholy and romantic Inspector Morse. And, as we find out, he never used his first name. He found pleasure in ale, classical music and difficult crossword puzzles.  In this episode we meet Sergeant Lewis, played by Kevin Whately.  Morse uses his intellect and lust for truth to investigate death and murder in the English university town of Oxford. He loved women, and as the series proceeds we meet many of them, however, he was unable to find a permanent relationship.This first episode, 'The Dead of Jericho' was first seen in January 1987.  Morse meets a young woman, Anne Stavely, played by a very young, Gemma Jones, at a classical chorale. Morse is taken with her, and they go out for drinks. He discovers as he sees her home, that she is involved with someone else. Hope makes plans, however, to pick her up for their big day when the chorale sings in public. He goes to pick her up, finds the door open but no one is home.  He later learns she has been found dead, hanging. This is not his case, but he hones in. After a bit, the Inspector in charge of the case is promoted to Superintendent, and Morse is put in charge.Thus begins the famous Morse/Lewis partnership.Morse suspects foul play and sets out to discover the truth. The esteemed, Anthony Minghella wrote the episode, and it was directed by Alastair Reid. This episode still holds up today. It is fun to see these actors playing in the prime of their lives.

570717,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000056T4S,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","I've become an ardent fan of the Inspector Morse series since discovering it about two months ago. I came to Morse by way of Inspector Lewis, and discovered that Kevin Whately (who is amazing as DI Lewis) also used to play DS Lewis in Inspector Morse. He is one of my favorite actors, and of course, John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting.In this first episode in what would become a long-running series, Chief Inspector Morse falls for one the singers in a local choir (of which Morse is also a member). Her name is Anna Stevely (played by Gemma Jones who first impressed me inThe Duchess of Duke Street - The Complete Collection) and she lives alone, making a living as a piano teacher. Morse tries to gently court her, but he senses something is not quite right, not that this puts him off. Well, the romance is short-lived as Anna is found dead, hanging in her kitchen. Is the death suicide, or is it murder?Morse applies himself diligently to figuring out who Anna really was, and makes some startling discoveries. Anna used to be married and had a child; she also had an affair with her superior at a company she used to work for; there's a rather eccentric student of Anna's who appears to have stolen money from her; there's the peeping tom sleazy neighbor; etc. In what would become trademark Morse, viewers are left trying to figure out who the perpetrator is, and this is never easy as the list of suspects is usually long, and there are red herrings aplenty.This is vintage Morse, and here is the episode listing in order:First Series (1987)The Dead of JerichoThe Silent World of Nicholas QuinnService of All the DeadSecond Series (1988)The Wolvercote TongueLast Seen WearingThe Settling of the SunLast Bus to WoodstockThird Series (1989)Ghost in the MachineThe Last EnemyDeceived by FlightThe Secret of Bay 5BFourth Series (1990)The Infernal SerpentThe Sins of the FathersDriven to DistractionMasonic MysteriesFifth Series (1991)Second Time AroundFat ChanceWho Killed Harry Field?Greeks Bearing GiftsPromised LandSixth Series (1992)Dead on TimeHappy FamiliesThe Death of the SelfAbsolute ConvictionCherubim and SeraphimSeventh Series (1993)Deadly SlumberThe Day of the DevilTwilight of the GodsSpecials 1995-2000The Way through the WoodsThe Daughters of CainDeath is Now My NeighbourThe Wench Is DeadThe Remorseful Day",5,The very first Inspector Morse episode,1323648000,"12 12, 2011",2011,2725,"[""'ve"", 'become', 'ardent', 'fan', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'series', 'discovering', 'two', 'months', 'came', 'Morse', 'way', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'discovered', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'who', 'amazing', 'DI', 'Lewis', 'also', 'used', 'play', 'DS', 'Lewis', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'course', 'John', 'Thaw', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'investigative', 'dramas', 'Thaw', 'Morse', 'compelling', 'watch', 'listening', 'operatic', 'music', 'quality', 'pint', 'ale', 'easily', 'smitten', 'pretty', 'face', 'intelligence', 'meticulous', 'astute', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'Morse', 'consummate', 'detective', 'most', 'Morse', 'episodes', 'are', 'superior', 'quality', 'terms', 'writing', 'acting.In', 'first', 'episode', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'long-running', 'series', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'one', 'singers', 'local', 'choir', 'Morse', 'also', 'member', 'name', 'Anna', 'Stevely', 'played', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'who', 'first', 'impressed', 'inThe', 'Duchess', 'Duke', 'Street', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'alone', 'making', 'living', 'piano', 'teacher', 'Morse', 'gently', 'court', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'not', 'off', 'Well', 'romance', 'short-lived', 'Anna', 'found', 'dead', 'hanging', 'kitchen', 'death', 'suicide', 'murder', 'Morse', 'applies', 'diligently', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'Anna', 'really', 'was', 'startling', 'discoveries', 'Anna', 'used', 'be', 'married', 'had', 'child', 'also', 'had', 'affair', 'superior', 'company', 'used', 'work', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'student', 'Anna', 'who', 'have', 'stolen', 'money', 'peeping', 'tom', 'sleazy', 'neighbor', 'etc', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'trademark', 'Morse', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'perpetrator', 'never', 'easy', 'list', 'suspects', 'usually', 'long', 'are', 'red', 'herrings', 'aplenty.This', 'vintage', 'Morse', 'here', 'episode', 'listing', 'order', 'First', 'Series', '1987', 'Dead', 'JerichoThe', 'Silent', 'World', 'Nicholas', 'QuinnService', 'All', 'DeadSecond', 'Series', '1988', 'Wolvercote', 'TongueLast', 'Seen', 'WearingThe', 'Settling', 'SunLast', 'Bus', 'WoodstockThird', 'Series', '1989', 'Ghost', 'MachineThe', 'Last', 'EnemyDeceived', 'FlightThe', 'Secret', 'Bay', '5BFourth', 'Series', '1990', 'Infernal', 'SerpentThe', 'Sins', 'FathersDriven', 'DistractionMasonic', 'MysteriesFifth', 'Series', '1991', 'Second', 'Time', 'AroundFat', 'ChanceWho', 'Killed', 'Harry', 'Field', 'Greeks', 'Bearing', 'GiftsPromised', 'LandSixth', 'Series', '1992', 'Dead', 'TimeHappy', 'FamiliesThe', 'Death', 'SelfAbsolute', 'ConvictionCherubim', 'SeraphimSeventh', 'Series', '1993', 'Deadly', 'SlumberThe', 'Day', 'DevilTwilight', 'GodsSpecials', '1995-2000The', 'Way', 'WoodsThe', 'Daughters', 'CainDeath', 'Now', 'My', 'NeighbourThe', 'Wench', 'DeadThe', 'Remorseful', 'Day']",N/A
