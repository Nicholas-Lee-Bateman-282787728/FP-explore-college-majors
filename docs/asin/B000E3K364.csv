As the story unfolds, you are drawn closer to the undercurrent that drives both characters. However, I cannot ignore two troubling implications made towards the end that prevent me from giving it my wholehearted recommendation -- the first: that a woman who has suffered a mental breakdown, been gripped by depression, and ultimately finds her true nature somehow lessens the 'manhood' of the husband who has loved her during her illness and recovery; the second: that developing a same-sex attraction for someone you've grown to admire and care about can be interpreted as an undetected mental instability. These two melodramatic whoppers should have been left on the cutting room floor. I've given ""Losing Chase"" three stars for the acting and production, and for a story that held tight until almost the end.",3,Almost good,1319155200,"10 21, 2011",2011,899,"['movie', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'leading', 'roles', 'quite', 'treat', 'story', 'unfolds', 'are', 'drawn', 'closer', 'undercurrent', 'characters', 'However', 'can', 'not', 'ignore', 'two', 'troubling', 'implications', 'made', 'end', 'prevent', 'giving', 'wholehearted', 'recommendation', 'first', 'woman', 'who', 'suffered', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'been', 'gripped', 'depression', 'ultimately', 'true', 'nature', 'somehow', ""'manhood"", ""'"", 'husband', 'who', 'loved', 'illness', 'recovery', 'second', 'developing', 'same-sex', 'attraction', 'someone', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'admire', 'care', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'undetected', 'mental', 'instability', 'two', 'melodramatic', 'whoppers', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', ""'ve"", 'given', 'Losing', 'Chase', 'three', 'stars', 'acting', 'production', 'story', 'held', 'tight', 'almost', 'end']",Losing Chase

Laway ""Lady E""","[4, 5]","From the surface, this movie is depressing, but there's nothing funny about mental illness or not finding yourself in this great big world. ""Losing Chase"" is one of those little known movies that you feel sad for because not a whole lot of people will get to see it.  Even I don't know how I came about it, but I am a huge Hellen Mirren fan ever since ""Excalibur."" She shines in this movie, but Kevin Bacon in his directorial debut shows a lot of sensitivity in portraying these two women. The other being Kyra Sedgwick who plays the young, post grad parent helper.  The setting is the gorgeous and languid Martha's Vineyard, if you've never been there, this movie will invite you to.  The begining of the movie might be a little uncomfortable to watch as young Elizabeth(Sedgwick) is introduced and humilated by Chase. Then there's the angry pre-teen son who is just as ascerbic and nasty to his mother. There's a lot of sadness in these characters because they have been  affected by mental illness,  but it's their inner strength and their kindness to each other that ultimately triumphs. Sedgwick and Mirren have that rare chemistry that true professional actors can convey on screen.

967304,A39DJ1I9L55Q4Q,B000E3K364,"pan ""pan""","[0, 0]","A great story! Mirren and Sedgwick's characters are complicated and played beautifully by both. Ms. Mirren's portrayal of a woman recovering from an emotional breakdown is on point, and she draws a trail for her audience in through her character's brokeness. Ms. Sedgwick's character has a 'breakdown' of her own one the night in their garden under the pouring rain. Sedgwick 'flips out'(sic) so perfectly. I think it's a great tribute to an actress/actor when they can so effectively emote the edgy and excruciating truth of a disturbed life. Both Mirren and Sedgwick accomplish this in this film. Each women's emotional wounds bring about a healing to one another. It's very touching. And, Beau Bridges plays a loving husband perfectly. But I must confess...my first reason for purchase was because I found out about the aforementioned kiss between Ms. Mirren and Ms. Sedgwick. To top all that off, this film is directed by Kevin Bacon, who generously includes a meditative cd with sounds of the ocean breaking on the shore. Which is reflective not only of the location where the film was shot, but, I also sense Mr. Bacon understands the healing benefit these sounds offer to anyone whose life has capsized.My only complaint is that there wasn't more kissing. ;) What can I say?",5,Helen and Kyra kiss!!,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,1281,"['great', 'story', 'Mirren', 'Sedgwick', 'characters', 'are', 'complicated', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Ms.', 'Mirren', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'recovering', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'point', 'trail', 'audience', 'character', 'brokeness', 'Ms.', 'Sedgwick', 'character', ""'breakdown"", ""'"", 'own', 'one', 'night', 'garden', 'pouring', 'rain', 'Sedgwick', 'out', 'sic', 'so', 'perfectly', 'think', 'great', 'tribute', 'actress/actor', 'when', 'can', 'so', 'effectively', 'emote', 'edgy', 'excruciating', 'truth', 'disturbed', 'life', 'Mirren', 'Sedgwick', 'accomplish', 'film', 'women', 'emotional', 'wounds', 'bring', 'healing', 'one', 'very', 'touching', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'loving', 'husband', 'perfectly', 'must', 'confess', 'first', 'reason', 'purchase', 'was', 'found', 'out', 'aforementioned', 'kiss', 'Ms.', 'Mirren', 'Ms.', 'Sedgwick', 'top', 'off', 'film', 'directed', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'generously', 'meditative', 'cd', 'sounds', 'ocean', 'breaking', 'shore', 'Which', 'reflective', 'not', 'only', 'location', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'also', 'sense', 'Mr.', 'Bacon', 'healing', 'benefit', 'offer', 'anyone', 'life', 'capsized.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'kissing', 'What', 'can', 'say']",Losing Chase
