She was lured in Poland into signing up with a company that promised to sneak her illegally into the United States via Mexico.  She paid them, and when she got to Mexico, found herself a captive and her child back in Poland under threat unless she complied.Second, I didn't find it incredible that a guard at a detainee camp should have shrugged off the Polish girl's claim.  He must hear such claims a dozen times a day.  Not that I'm defending him.  He should have reported it.This problem is important, and that it is made possible by the government's present Open Borders policy is one of the things people should become incensed about.  Close the borders, the trade is no longer profitable, the trade dries up.  Alternatively, leave the borders open and play police and try to trace every single one of the thousands of women and children being trafficked across every night.  Which approach is more likely to succeed?See alsoAshanti, andHuman Trafficking.My most serious complaint is that in ""Human Trafficking"", the bad guy is an American.  In ""Trade"", the bad guys are the Russians.  Fine.  I'm sure there are Americans and Russians involved in this trade.

So we were immeadiately intrigued when we came across this film while flipping through the tv channels one evening.  What we experienced via this movie is the engrossing, yet horrifying realization that this sex trafficking evil is permeating the underworld of both of our homelands.  It is a well done film, showing how the Russian mob is trafficking girls to Mexico from Eastern Europe and then smuggling them (and some local Mexicans as well) across the U. S. border for bidding into the sex trade.  The movie opens with a girl receiving a bicycle from her brother as a birthday present.  An innocent enough gift from our sheltered U. S. points of view, but an alarming gift from the Mexican Mother's point of view who forbids her daughter from ever riding it. Eventually, the girl goes looking for her brother on her bicycle and the cause for her Mother's concern becomes clear. As the thirteen year old girl is kidnapped off her bicycle by the Russian mob and sold into the sex trade.  Her brother tries to rescue her and is aided by an American cop looking for his daughter, who was sold into the trade ten years prior.  One of the powerful moments in the movie is the alive but inwardly dead blonde girl after she is brutally raped by her kidnappers.  In closing, this is an engrossing movie about a topic that is willfully being ignored by our society.  It is an eye opener.  And will stir one's inner psyche in a heart wrenching manner.

While driving a Jeep we came upon a man with a rifle and a gate that read ""detour"". As we drove over the mountain road we were assaulted and robbed at gunpoint. That is the Mexican mentality. Why work for money when you can just rob someone who has. Needless to say I have never been back. I was given this movie and was disturbed beyond belief at how inhumane we can be to each other when sex and money are involved. I LOVE horror films with special effects..they are fun! The real horror of this film or should I say terror...is that it is REAL and happening every minute of every day. It is called supply and demand. If there was no demand these little children would not be raped, sodomized and brutally beaten for the ""kicks"" of perverts. The sad thing is...those perverts are our husbands, boyfriends, teachers, law enforcement..the very people who are supposed to protect us. The reason is because most men are animals who will stop at nothing to satisfy that ""urge"". Be it little children, non consenual sex ( Rape ) even sheep aren't safe from most men. There are a few of us like myself who are decent men and only sleep with each other as long as we are consenting adults.

1119980,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000YIGND6,Grady Harp,"[45, 46]","Based on an article written by Peter Landesman, who also wrote the story and co-wrote the screenplay with Jose Rivera ('The Motorcycle Diaries'), TRADE literally forces us to experience the cruel, vicious international market for sex slaves.  It is brutally captured on film by director Marco Kreuzpaintner ('Summer Storm') in a manner that spares nothing to unveil the atrocities created by the many people form all countries who ply this trade.  It is a tough film to watch, but it is also an important film to see: the public MUST be made aware of this criminal activity that robs the lives of children and adults around the globe.The setting is Mexico City and in the poor sector lives a fatherless family supported by the oldest son Jorge (Cesar Ramos) whose 'occupation' is petty crime that allows him to bring in money for his mother and his beloved sister Adriana (Paulina Gaitan).  We see the abduction of a beautiful young Polish girl Weronica (Alicja Bachleda-Curus) in the Russian sector of the city.  Soon after Adriana, trying out her newest bicycle gift from Jorge, is likewise abducted.  The girls (and boys) are kept in filthy apartments awaiting border crossings into the US where they will be shipped to New Jersey for sale after being advertised for auction on the Internet. Jorge discovers the absence of his sister, traces her to the Russian sector where he sees the filth in which the victims are kept, but where he also encounters a Texas policeman Ray Sheridan (Kevin Kline) who is continuing his years long search for his daughter.  The two 'meet' and join in the chase for the lost girls.  And it is the manner in which Jorge and Ray gradually become friends and the clever way in which they cooperate that forms the rest of the story.Yes, the film is overlong and borders a bit too closely on soap opera techniques, but the acting is so committed and the story is news so important that any flaw in the film can be forgiven because it opens the door to a crime that is all too unfamiliar to most citizens.  It is a true story  and therein lies the terror. It should be seen.

Unfortunately, the Internet has made it easier for sleazeballs to market young Mexican girls to perverts.There's really not much to say about the acting in this film. Kevin Kline's performance was lean and economical--his role wasn't overwritten, which helped to keep the focus on the film's sad premise.The film's plot revolves around a young streetsmart Mexican punk and his younger--13 year old--sister. Russian slave-traders abduct the 13 year old girl and process her and others out of Mexico and into the U.S. Meanwhile, the girl's older brother persuades an American tourist--insurance man--to help him find his little sister. It's here that the movie threatens to lose focus by staging political--and cliche--verbal exchanges between Kline and the Mexican punk. Thankfully, though, these exhanges were brief and interrupted by scenes involving the trafficked women and their sadistic keepers. Like livestock, the women are packed and shipped in trucks, held in  dungeons, and shepherded across hot acrid terrain. Prospective buyers molest the stolen women who are dazed and numbed by all the drugs their keepers feed them.As a film, Trade doesn't break any new ground; however, the film's subject is potent enough that there's no need to do anything to distract from its main focus.",4,Needless melodrama,1221091200,"09 11, 2008",2008,1327,"['Trade', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'Unfortunately', 'Internet', 'made', 'easier', 'sleazeballs', 'market', 'young', 'Mexican', 'girls', 'perverts.There', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'acting', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'performance', 'was', 'lean', 'economical', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'overwritten', 'helped', 'keep', 'focus', 'film', 'sad', 'premise.The', 'film', 'plot', 'around', 'young', 'streetsmart', 'Mexican', 'punk', 'younger', '13', 'year', 'old', 'sister', 'Russian', 'slave-traders', 'abduct', '13', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'process', 'others', 'Mexico', 'U.S', 'Meanwhile', 'girl', 'older', 'brother', 'American', 'tourist', 'insurance', 'man', 'help', 'find', 'little', 'sister', 'here', 'movie', 'lose', 'focus', 'staging', 'political', 'cliche', 'verbal', 'exchanges', 'Kline', 'Mexican', 'punk', 'Thankfully', 'though', 'exhanges', 'were', 'brief', 'interrupted', 'scenes', 'involving', 'trafficked', 'women', 'sadistic', 'keepers', 'livestock', 'women', 'are', 'packed', 'shipped', 'trucks', 'held', 'dungeons', 'shepherded', 'hot', 'acrid', 'terrain', 'Prospective', 'buyers', 'molest', 'stolen', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'dazed', 'numbed', 'drugs', 'keepers', 'feed', 'film', 'Trade', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'however', 'film', 'subject', 'potent', 'enough', 'need', 'do', 'anything', 'distract', 'main', 'focus']",N/A

Not because of the inherent qualities of it as a movie but because of the message it was trying to convey.Judging from some of the reviews out there some people are trying to make more out of implied politics than it genuinely contained.The fact of the matter is that there are slaves in the world and some of them live in our world, whether we like it or not. Some of the best selling non-fiction works of the last few years have been about the trafficking of people across borders. Every once in a while a story surfaces about people who abuse slaves in their homes IN AMERICA, people who are often good citizens.The dramatisation in this story does leave something to be derired but it is a very human tale of people who care in a commodity based world where the lives and existance of some people count for nothing. Indeed some of the reviews reflect that viewpoint.In my view Trade does nothing more than open a chink in a blind. To get public attention on a worthwhile cause is difficult enough in a corporate media world and sometimes anything that can get a worthwhile message across to even a few people is worthwhile doing anyway.Trade sends out an emotional message. Ask any mother how she would feel and act if her child was stolen and some understanding will be gained. If that message requires some additional drama to help than perhaps that is a good thing.There is no such thing as a perfect movie, otherwise none of us would have anything to write about. I would encourage everyone who reads and writes on such pages as these to encourage as many people as possible to watch this movie and then to ask your local opinion formers what they are doing to end the scourge of slavery.

Enright,"[7, 9]","""Trade"" provides a good introduction to the sort of horrendous underground economies that have boomed with the expansion of neoliberal economics.  One thing that is missing from accounts of the sex trade is an analysis of its root causes.  There has always been prostitution and sexual exploitation, but never on the scale that it is on today.  For that sort of deeper understanding, I'd suggestRogue Economics: Capitalism's New Reality.Ideologues often celebrate so-called ""free trade"" and events like the fall of the Berlin wall, but we rarely take a look at what these developments have meant.  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, life expectancy in Russia has dropped by ten years, and prostitution and smuggling have flourished in what has become a mafia state.  Journalists who criticize the crony capitalism and its failures often end up dead. Similar economic catastrophes have unfolded in Latin America and throughout the Global South, where wealthy men travel to rent the bodies of poor people.  There are even books such asThe Hedonist: World Sex Guide - Single Male Erotic Vacations in Rio, Costa Rica, Thailand, Carribean and much morethat advise men on where to go to purchase women.It's all quite depressing.One problem I had with this film is how it ends with police swooping in to save the day, like the calvary.  No doubt, police can have an important role to play in bringing people to justice.  Yet, police and other agents of the growing global police state are often very much involved in sexual exploitation themselves.  Guards at prisons, members of our military, DEA/DHS/ICE personnel, and border guards often demand sex from people who are detained or whose countries we've invaded.Against Our Will: Men, Women, and RapeU.S. generated media is also among some of the most sexist material ever created, adding to the devaluation of women as simply sex objects.Rape on Prime Time: Television, Masculinity, and Sexual Violence (Feminist Cultural Studies, the Media, and Political Culture)Maybe future films on the sex trade will cover economic roots of this injustice, as well as portray women's groups and social justice groups that are working on these issues.

I was led to believe from what I read that this was going to an extremely dark, sick, violent film. Im actually glad that it wasnt like that at all. Though the subject matter of this film is very grim, its one of the least dark or violent films I have seen on this subject matter or similar subject matter. I suppose the movie gets the point across but it does so without being graphic at all. There is very little violence in this film and one very mild and brief rape scene. Everything else is simply suggested along with one or two girls getting slapped around very mildly. The reason however I felt compelled to give this film only 3 stars is that it simply doesnt seem belivable on any level. What I mean by that is that the script, production, and director attempt to make this realistic and frank, but all attempts fail miserably unfortunately. I have seen a lot of films labled as disturbing or grim and this one is the least disturbing, dark, or violent I think I have ever seen. If your looking for something shocking or genuinly upsettling or disturbing then your going to be truly dissapointed. See the French shocker Irreversable or the film based on Jack Ketchums book The girl next door and youll see what I mean. And in fact if this movie shocks or really disturbs you I highly urge you to forget about either film I just mentioned. This movie tells the truth, but it tells it very weakly and doesnt begin to illustrate just how bad this subject is in reality. This is a watered down tale with no sense of what things are really like. Maybe thats a good thing, because what really happens is far darker than anything this film tries to get you to believe.

1120004,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B000YIGND6,The Jaundiced Eye,"[6, 9]","Since I live directly across the Rio Grande from Juarez, Mexico, movies that involve this locale are of particular interest. Other reviewers have provided detailed plot summaries, and I concur with their generally favorable opinion of the overall production; however, a few flaws detracted from my enjoyment.First, the young brother appears to follow his kidnapped sister from Mexico City to Ciudad Juarez in a ""borrowed"" beat-up old 70's car. The trip appears to take an hour or so and is accomplished on less than a tank of gas. The boy has no money and could not buy food or gasoline if he needed it. Anyone even remotely familiar with Mexican geography knows that the distance of this little ""jaunt"" is well over 1000 miles, and would require several days and $300-$400 worth of gasoline. I guarantee that the author of this screenplay knows this and simply chose to overlook it because it does not serve the plot. While many Americans are naive with regard to international geography, I feel that this conspicuous oversight was lazy, needless, and troubling. When obvious liberties are taken with minor points, it can make one question the veracity of other, major ones. This movie is presented as being based on fact; therefore, it should be more careful with the ""facts"" it presents.Second, while the girls are in custody of the Border Patrol in El Paso, TX the Polish girl attempts to inform the B.P. agent that she and her friend have been kidnapped. The agent brushes off her allegation with a ""yeah...sure"". In light of currently high concerns for national security, the presence of a Polish national in custody for illegally crossing the Southern U.S. border would be a matter of great concern and interest. Her accent alone, without allegations, would draw close scrutiny and interrogation. The callous presentation of the B.P. agent is overdone, unrealistic in this circumstance, and more likely an indication of personal animosity on the part of the screenwriter. Again, it may serve the plot, but it is neither fair nor realistic. Border Patrol agents perform an immensely difficult, dangerous, and generally underappreciated service to this country. They deserve better treatment by the media.Finally, I have lived in this area all my life, hiking and off-roading extensively, and have yet to hear of truckloads of young, kidnapped foreign women ""servicing"" disgusting perverts in cane fields. It may be going on every day, and in the movie appears to be going on in my immediate vicinity, but I have yet to see any evidence or even hear rumors of it happening. The scenes in the movie are quite disturbing, however, and serve the plot well, but are they accurate? In addition, the area in question is subject to intense aeriel and ground scrutiny by federal agents, night and day, making the activities depicted quite likely to be detected and thus, unlikely.In conclusion, the movie is indeed harrowing, entertaining, and worth the price of rental and (perhaps) purchase. The violence associated with the drug trade is currently tearing Mexico apart. The movie, Traffic, provides a realistic representation. Currently, there are heavily armed soldiers on the streets of Juarez, attempting to maintain order and reduce the escalating levels of violence and murder. This movie makes it appear that other, more subtle and yet equally disturbing crimes are being perpetrated against women in this area and on an international scale. If movies such as this, however flawed, draw attention to legitimate atrocities, then they should be seen, but greater attention to accuracy and detail would make the movie's theme more compelling and its basis on fact more convincing.",4,Excellent Movie with Several Flaws.....,1204675200,"03 5, 2008",2008,3683,"['live', 'directly', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'Juarez', 'Mexico', 'movies', 'involve', 'locale', 'are', 'particular', 'interest', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'provided', 'detailed', 'plot', 'summaries', 'concur', 'generally', 'favorable', 'opinion', 'overall', 'production', 'however', 'few', 'flaws', 'detracted', 'enjoyment.First', 'young', 'brother', 'follow', 'kidnapped', 'sister', 'Mexico', 'City', 'Ciudad', 'Juarez', 'borrowed', 'beat-up', 'old', '70', 'car', 'trip', 'take', 'hour', 'so', 'accomplished', 'less', 'tank', 'gas', 'boy', 'money', 'could', 'not', 'buy', 'food', 'gasoline', 'needed', 'Anyone', 'even', 'remotely', 'familiar', 'Mexican', 'geography', 'distance', 'little', 'jaunt', 'well', '1000', 'miles', 'would', 'require', 'several', 'days', '300-', '400', 'worth', 'gasoline', 'guarantee', 'author', 'screenplay', 'simply', 'chose', 'overlook', 'not', 'serve', 'plot', 'many', 'Americans', 'are', 'naive', 'regard', 'international', 'geography', 'feel', 'conspicuous', 'oversight', 'was', 'lazy', 'needless', 'troubling', 'When', 'obvious', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'minor', 'points', 'can', 'make', 'one', 'question', 'veracity', 'other', 'major', 'ones', 'movie', 'presented', 'being', 'based', 'fact', 'therefore', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'careful', 'facts', 'girls', 'are', 'custody', 'Border', 'Patrol', 'El', 'Paso', 'TX', 'Polish', 'girl', 'attempts', 'inform', 'B.P', 'agent', 'friend', 'have', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'agent', 'allegation', 'yeah', 'sure', 'light', 'currently', 'high', 'concerns', 'national', 'security', 'presence', 'Polish', 'national', 'custody', 'illegally', 'crossing', 'Southern', 'U.S.', 'border', 'would', 'be', 'matter', 'great', 'concern', 'interest', 'accent', 'alone', 'allegations', 'would', 'draw', 'close', 'scrutiny', 'interrogation', 'callous', 'presentation', 'B.P', 'agent', 'overdone', 'unrealistic', 'circumstance', 'more', 'likely', 'indication', 'personal', 'animosity', 'part', 'screenwriter', 'Again', 'may', 'serve', 'plot', 'fair', 'realistic', 'Border', 'Patrol', 'agents', 'perform', 'immensely', 'difficult', 'dangerous', 'generally', 'underappreciated', 'service', 'country', 'deserve', 'better', 'treatment', 'media.Finally', 'have', 'lived', 'area', 'life', 'hiking', 'off-roading', 'extensively', 'have', 'yet', 'hear', 'truckloads', 'young', 'kidnapped', 'foreign', 'women', 'servicing', 'disgusting', 'perverts', 'cane', 'fields', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'day', 'movie', 'be', 'going', 'immediate', 'vicinity', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'evidence', 'even', 'hear', 'rumors', 'happening', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'however', 'serve', 'plot', 'well', 'are', 'accurate', 'addition', 'area', 'question', 'subject', 'intense', 'aeriel', 'ground', 'scrutiny', 'federal', 'agents', 'night', 'day', 'making', 'activities', 'depicted', 'quite', 'likely', 'be', 'detected', 'thus', 'unlikely.In', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'indeed', 'harrowing', 'entertaining', 'price', 'rental', 'perhaps', 'purchase', 'violence', 'associated', 'drug', 'trade', 'currently', 'tearing', 'Mexico', 'apart', 'movie', 'Traffic', 'realistic', 'representation', 'Currently', 'are', 'heavily', 'armed', 'soldiers', 'streets', 'Juarez', 'attempting', 'maintain', 'order', 'reduce', 'escalating', 'levels', 'violence', 'murder', 'movie', 'appear', 'other', 'more', 'subtle', 'yet', 'equally', 'disturbing', 'crimes', 'are', 'being', 'perpetrated', 'women', 'area', 'international', 'scale', 'movies', 'such', 'however', 'flawed', 'draw', 'attention', 'legitimate', 'atrocities', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'greater', 'attention', 'accuracy', 'detail', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'theme', 'more', 'compelling', 'basis', 'fact', 'more', 'convincing']",N/A

You can feel outrage for the foreign victims of an evil sex trade while watching drunken young American girls carrying on like total sleazes for free booze.  Nice world.When it comes to movies that deal with the shadowy international sex trade, Hollywood only knows two speeds: a totally depressing pseudo-documentary that'll completely bum you out or some late night CineMax exploitation movie with someone like Shannon Tweed or another softcore B-movie queen in some mild bondage.  You either get lots of harsh reality or lots of sleazy nudity.Well, TRADE is the former.  Just letting you know which one you're getting.  If you want a titillating but grungy B-movie mostly set in border strip clubs and ends with a big ridiculous shootout...go somewhere else.  And get a life.TRADE begins in the depressingly real squalor of Mexico City.  A single Polish mother is brought to Mexico for a ""trip to L.A. and stardom"" where she's immediately beaten and raped by the Russian mob.  The Russians also nab a 13-year-old Mexican girl while her street smart brother, an up and coming earner who victimizes tourists looking for sex with kids in a totally unrelated enterprise, begins an improbable rescue mission that goes from Mexico to New Jersey.  (Sounds preposterous, but it works).  The brother joins up with Kevin Kline, a former detective searching for a long-lost daughter of his own.The first part of the movie is raw and depressing.  It has a stark realism, believable characters and excellent acting.  The middle is a road picture as the girls are driven across the US to be sold while Kevin Kline and the brother bond on a parallel course.  The last part is the most ""movie"" part: everything converges in a choreographed ending that ties up everything.But this is one of those movies--like the old HARDCORE movie of the 70s with George C. Scott or the sexless ""8MM"" completely populated with sleazy men and an overacting Nicolas Cage--where the subject matter blunts the impact of the movie.  The medium pales next to the horrific reality of the sex trade.  Almost every man is a disgusting pervert or a vile gangster pimp, the women are virginal victims totally defiled and desecrated by them...okay, we get it.  Life is horrible.  It's really, really horrible for some people.I don't want the sleazy exploitation movies (they're even simpler) but I would like to see a movie sometime where the black hats and the one (maybe) white hat aren't so broadly painted.This is a well-made but sad film and any real victory in the end is weighed down by all the girls and women still out there who will not get a happy ending from real life.",3,Despair Vs.

1120007,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000YIGND6,Z Hayes,"[24, 26]","The sexual trafficking of women and children around the world is one of the most deplorable crimes and also one of the least understood and under the radar. Having watched a mini-series called Human Trafficking starring Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland, I was eager to check this movie out.It is a riveting story and well-told. The story centers around the abduction of a Polish tourist, and also a 13 year old girl in mexico City[Paulina Gaitan] and how her 17 year old brother[Jorge Cesar Ramos] goes all out to find her. He is joined in his efforts by a Texas investigator, played by Kevin Kline, who has also been searching for his own missing daughter [for years]. Turns out the kidnapped victims are being transported to New Jersey where they are to be auctioned off online.This is a very disturbing movie and very graphic. The scenes of abuse and rape are unsettling to say the least. But, it is a story that needs to be told, and the public need to be made aware that these atrocities are happening, often under the noses of the authorities and people who seem to turn a blind eye to these monstrous acts.There are so many commercial movies that the paying public goes to see, and that's fine. Yet, movies like these that have a powerful social message seem to be grossly underrated and underappreciated. ""Trade"" may not the definitive movie on the subject, yet it is definitely one with a powerful message that hopefully serves to educate the general public about the horrors of sexual trafficking.",4,A grim movie about human sexual trafficking,1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,1509,"['sexual', 'trafficking', 'women', 'children', 'world', 'one', 'most', 'deplorable', 'crimes', 'also', 'one', 'least', 'understood', 'radar', 'Having', 'watched', 'mini-series', 'called', 'Human', 'Trafficking', 'starring', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'was', 'eager', 'check', 'movie', 'out.It', 'riveting', 'story', 'well-told', 'story', 'centers', 'abduction', 'Polish', 'tourist', 'also', '13', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'mexico', 'City', '[', 'Paulina', 'Gaitan', ']', 'how', '17', 'year', 'old', 'brother', '[', 'Jorge', 'Cesar', 'Ramos', ']', 'find', 'joined', 'efforts', 'Texas', 'investigator', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'who', 'also', 'been', 'searching', 'own', 'missing', 'daughter', '[', 'years', ']', 'out', 'kidnapped', 'victims', 'are', 'being', 'transported', 'New', 'Jersey', 'where', 'are', 'be', 'auctioned', 'off', 'online.This', 'very', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'very', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'abuse', 'rape', 'are', 'unsettling', 'say', 'least', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'public', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'aware', 'atrocities', 'are', 'happening', 'often', 'noses', 'authorities', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'monstrous', 'acts.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'commercial', 'movies', 'paying', 'public', 'see', 'fine', 'movies', 'have', 'powerful', 'social', 'message', 'seem', 'be', 'grossly', 'underrated', 'underappreciated', 'Trade', 'may', 'not', 'definitive', 'movie', 'subject', 'definitely', 'one', 'powerful', 'message', 'hopefully', 'educate', 'general', 'public', 'horrors', 'sexual', 'trafficking']",N/A
