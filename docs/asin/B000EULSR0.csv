Hernandez,"[9, 10]","Incredibly, HBO keeps renewing the Sopraos while it grows ever more plodding and irrelevant, yet they cancel Deadwood, which is probably the best piece of programming they have EVER had.The Sopranos big story line this year?  The same as everyone else: somebody is gay.  Big whoop, big surprise.  Let's face it, it's tired unto death.  Both the idea and the show.Deadwood, however, is brilliantly written, acted and executed.  The language is coarse as a steel-wool pad, but that's one of the things that makes this so astonishing.  Despite it's vulgarity, the dialogue is used to near poetic effect.The character of Al Swearingen is so complex as to be almost incomprehensible: always concerned with his personal bottom line, one moment brutal and carnal, then next tender and compassionate, then suddenly concerned with the welfare of the assorted denizens of this sewer of a camp.  Strangly, like all humans, it all seems to make sense once we become aware of the over-arching motivations that become revealed during the course of the season.Seth Bullock is, as always, a walking volcano of contradiction.  Struggling to make his way in a vile locale, hoping to make life better, yet beset with a constantly simmering nitroglycerine laced temper that explodes on occasion.  I've never seen a actor who can convey barely controlled rage the way Olliphant can.Add the other brilliant actors, all given suberb dialogue, and a plot that constantly throws curves your way (much as real life will) and you have a superb drama.Yet HBO killed it and renewed the slogging Sopranos.What were they thinking?  Maybe they had too many cannolis and were asleep at the switch.  Or maybe it's all about what it is always about: $$.",5,They kill this but keep the Sopranos??,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,1718,"['Incredibly', 'HBO', 'renewing', 'Sopraos', 'ever', 'more', 'plodding', 'irrelevant', 'yet', 'cancel', 'Deadwood', 'probably', 'best', 'piece', 'programming', 'have', 'EVER', 'had.The', 'Sopranos', 'big', 'story', 'line', 'year', 'same', 'everyone', 'else', 'somebody', 'gay', 'Big', 'whoop', 'big', 'surprise', 'Let', 'face', 'tired', 'unto', 'death', 'idea', 'show.Deadwood', 'however', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'acted', 'executed', 'language', 'coarse', 'steel-wool', 'pad', 'one', 'things', 'so', 'astonishing', 'vulgarity', 'dialogue', 'used', 'poetic', 'effect.The', 'character', 'Al', 'Swearingen', 'so', 'complex', 'be', 'almost', 'incomprehensible', 'always', 'concerned', 'personal', 'bottom', 'line', 'one', 'moment', 'brutal', 'carnal', 'then', 'next', 'tender', 'compassionate', 'then', 'suddenly', 'concerned', 'welfare', 'assorted', 'denizens', 'sewer', 'camp', 'Strangly', 'humans', 'make', 'sense', 'become', 'aware', 'over-arching', 'motivations', 'become', 'revealed', 'course', 'season.Seth', 'Bullock', 'always', 'walking', 'volcano', 'contradiction', 'Struggling', 'make', 'way', 'vile', 'locale', 'hoping', 'make', 'life', 'better', 'yet', 'beset', 'constantly', 'simmering', 'nitroglycerine', 'laced', 'occasion', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'convey', 'barely', 'controlled', 'rage', 'way', 'Olliphant', 'other', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'given', 'suberb', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'constantly', 'curves', 'way', 'much', 'real', 'life', 'will', 'have', 'superb', 'drama.Yet', 'HBO', 'killed', 'renewed', 'slogging', 'were', 'thinking', 'Maybe', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'cannolis', 'were', 'asleep', 'switch', 'what', 'always']",Deadwood: Season 2
979139,AM18CU72YEWH5,B000EULSR0,A. J Terry,"[3, 7]","I've never seen ""Deadwood"" on TV, but I just watched Seasons 1 and 2 of the DVDs back to back. Season 1 is better, because it gives a much stronger sense of moral ambiguity. In Season 1, Al Swearengen is a brutal villain whose frequent response to problems is to have the person causing them killed and fed to a local butcher's pigs; or at least badly beaten up. But he occasionally does fine things for the wrong reasons. Like organizing (and paying handsomely for) a run for vaccine and an isolation tent to save Deadwood from a severe smallpox epidemic--because it would be bad for Swearengen's business.In Season 2, Swearengen is more like a corporate executive--power hungry, manipulative, but with a soft inner side that causes him to do some very nice things that don't benefit him at all.  And, when he becomes bedridden from three serious physical problems at once (which seems excessive), everyone in the Gem, including his most brutal lackeys, the lame woman he habitually insults, the whores he beats up, etc., hang around misty-eyed for a long time (as far as the viewer is concerned) tearfully hoping for and promoting his recovery, while telling each other what a sweet guy he is.Overall Season 2 slips into sentimentality, and into some obvious attempts to manipulate viewer emotions. There are a two episodes with a prolonged and tedious focus on a cute little boy, only to kill him off and have a pathetic funeral. Meanwhile, the Season 2 murders of three women by a Jack-the-Ripper counterpart, a fraternal murder for gain, a near-fatal shooting, and the deaths of a number of Chinese, go by like all the murders in Season 1--that is to say, just business as usual in Deadwood. Why is a child's death worth the better part of two episodes, and all the adult deaths are pretty much passed over?The last episode, which frantically sets up several new story lines, apparently to hook viewers for Season 3, is too transparent. It is clear you are watching a TV show, and the feeling of being ""in"" Deadwood is lost. Likewise, the sudden discovery/revelation of a secret passage between the Gem Saloon and the newspaper office is just too much.Season 2 isn't bad, but it has definitely lost some of its edge compared to Season 1. It does have the same beautiful visuals as Season 1, and it's hard not to be curious about the stories of compelling characters (even if the characters have been changed somewhat). I hope Season 3 (which I will watch when it comes out on DVD) gets back on track.",4,Comparison with the First Season,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,2505,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Deadwood', 'TV', 'just', 'watched', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'DVDs', 'back', 'back', 'Season', '1', 'better', 'much', 'stronger', 'sense', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'Season', '1', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'brutal', 'villain', 'frequent', 'response', 'problems', 'have', 'person', 'causing', 'killed', 'fed', 'local', 'butcher', 'pigs', 'least', 'badly', 'beaten', 'up', 'occasionally', 'fine', 'things', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'organizing', 'paying', 'handsomely', 'run', 'vaccine', 'isolation', 'tent', 'save', 'Deadwood', 'severe', 'smallpox', 'epidemic', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'Swearengen', 'business.In', 'Season', '2', 'Swearengen', 'more', 'corporate', 'executive', 'power', 'hungry', 'manipulative', 'soft', 'inner', 'side', 'do', 'very', 'nice', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'benefit', 'when', 'bedridden', 'three', 'serious', 'physical', 'problems', 'once', 'excessive', 'everyone', 'Gem', 'including', 'most', 'brutal', 'lackeys', 'lame', 'woman', 'habitually', 'insults', 'whores', 'up', 'etc.', 'hang', 'misty-eyed', 'long', 'time', 'as', 'far', 'viewer', 'concerned', 'tearfully', 'hoping', 'promoting', 'recovery', 'telling', 'other', 'what', 'sweet', 'guy', 'Season', '2', 'slips', 'sentimentality', 'obvious', 'attempts', 'manipulate', 'viewer', 'emotions', 'are', 'two', 'episodes', 'prolonged', 'tedious', 'focus', 'cute', 'little', 'boy', 'only', 'kill', 'off', 'have', 'pathetic', 'funeral', 'Meanwhile', 'Season', '2', 'murders', 'three', 'women', 'Jack-the-Ripper', 'counterpart', 'fraternal', 'murder', 'gain', 'near-fatal', 'shooting', 'deaths', 'number', 'Chinese', 'go', 'murders', 'Season', '1', 'say', 'just', 'business', 'usual', 'Deadwood', 'Why', 'child', 'death', 'better', 'part', 'two', 'episodes', 'adult', 'deaths', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'passed', 'last', 'episode', 'frantically', 'up', 'several', 'new', 'story', 'lines', 'apparently', 'hook', 'viewers', 'Season', '3', 'too', 'transparent', 'clear', 'are', 'watching', 'TV', 'show', 'feeling', 'being', 'Deadwood', 'lost', 'Likewise', 'sudden', 'discovery/revelation', 'secret', 'passage', 'Gem', 'Saloon', 'newspaper', 'office', 'just', 'too', 'much.Season', '2', ""n't"", 'bad', 'definitely', 'lost', 'edge', 'compared', 'Season', '1', 'have', 'same', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'Season', '1', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'curious', 'stories', 'compelling', 'characters', 'even', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'somewhat', 'hope', 'Season', '3', 'will', 'watch', 'when', 'out', 'DVD', 'back', 'track']",Deadwood: Season 2

979144,ARA48345JZPZR,B000EULSR0,Archmaker,"[5, 5]","David Milch and Company struck a rich vein of creative ore with Season 1 of Deadwood: brilliant, profane, quirky, hilarious, unexpected and unique; and, Season 2 falls in stride to continue the tale of the lawless boom town full of the ambitious, the broken, the crazed and the lost, and to further Milch's exploration of themes both broad and intimate concerning how individuals behave, one to another, and how they organize themselves when there is no other ostensible organizing principle beyond greed but which, in reality, only masks the inherent and instinctive human desire for structure and family, albeit here, some mighty dysfunctional families at that.Beginning with a brutal showdown fight between Bullock (Tim Olyphant) and Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) which is actually not a culmination but really the beginning of their close bonding as allies, Milch then takes the unprecedented step of side-tracking his magnificent and audience-popular central character Swearengen for several episodes to allow a fuller exploration of other characters and their relationships.  With the Boss down and out of action, the followers and hangers-on scramble in panic, indecision and vulnerability. Meanwhile we are introduced to new characters and themes, most notably the chilling psychopath Wolcott, and the aging and desperately mercenary Maddie, and following on the heels of all is the toweringly ruthless George Hearst, making his appearance finally at Season's end and debuting what will be an absolutely brilliant turn by Gerald McRaney that will continue and expand in Season 3.  This Season contains within it a tragedy and its aftermath that is handled with superb sensitivity and depicted with tact and understatement that I found very moving.Deadwood would never be a series for a general audience, and I would recommend it soley to those whose tastes I know well.  It is not a Western, if your idea of Westerns are cowboy movies.  It is not reality, no more than the lives of English Kings are the reality of Shakespeare's plays.  The reality of Deadwood, as detailed in the DVD extras, is merely a starting place for the imaginative spell Milch weaves with character and dialogue and mood and atmosphere.  It is obvious there are many who are deaf, dumb and blind to the simple pleasures of droll dialogue, quirky asides and a convulted plot that many times finds numerous side trips and diversions on its way to often ambiguous conclusion.  So be it.Deadwood is obviously not for all tastes, and delicate sensibilities need not apply.  It remains obsinately, brilliantly, profanely eloquent with difficult and flawed characters, priceless dialogue, and themes big and small for those who love it.  It wears its ecentricities proudly and it is a feast of terrific acting by a fine ensemble cast, in a marvelous set, that is lit, photographed and directed in a series that is superior to most films, let alone most television.  And for those who hate it and those of us who love it, Season 3 gets even more eccentric and weird, God bless it!",5,"Advances, None Miraculous....",1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,3053,"['David', 'Milch', 'Company', 'struck', 'rich', 'vein', 'creative', 'ore', 'Season', '1', 'Deadwood', 'brilliant', 'profane', 'quirky', 'hilarious', 'unexpected', 'unique', 'Season', '2', 'falls', 'stride', 'continue', 'tale', 'lawless', 'boom', 'town', 'full', 'ambitious', 'broken', 'crazed', 'lost', 'further', 'Milch', 'exploration', 'themes', 'broad', 'intimate', 'concerning', 'how', 'individuals', 'behave', 'one', 'how', 'organize', 'when', 'other', 'ostensible', 'organizing', 'principle', 'greed', 'reality', 'only', 'inherent', 'instinctive', 'human', 'desire', 'structure', 'family', 'albeit', 'here', 'mighty', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'that.Beginning', 'brutal', 'showdown', 'fight', 'Bullock', 'Tim', 'Olyphant', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'actually', 'not', 'culmination', 'really', 'beginning', 'close', 'bonding', 'allies', 'Milch', 'then', 'unprecedented', 'step', 'side-tracking', 'magnificent', 'audience-popular', 'central', 'character', 'Swearengen', 'several', 'episodes', 'allow', 'fuller', 'exploration', 'other', 'characters', 'relationships', 'Boss', 'down', 'action', 'followers', 'hangers-on', 'scramble', 'panic', 'indecision', 'vulnerability', 'Meanwhile', 'are', 'introduced', 'new', 'characters', 'themes', 'most', 'notably', 'chilling', 'psychopath', 'Wolcott', 'aging', 'desperately', 'mercenary', 'Maddie', 'following', 'heels', 'toweringly', 'ruthless', 'George', 'Hearst', 'making', 'appearance', 'finally', 'Season', 'end', 'debuting', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'turn', 'Gerald', 'McRaney', 'will', 'continue', 'expand', 'Season', '3', 'Season', 'tragedy', 'aftermath', 'handled', 'superb', 'sensitivity', 'depicted', 'tact', 'understatement', 'found', 'very', 'moving.Deadwood', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'series', 'general', 'audience', 'would', 'recommend', 'soley', 'tastes', 'know', 'well', 'not', 'Western', 'idea', 'Westerns', 'are', 'cowboy', 'movies', 'not', 'reality', 'more', 'lives', 'English', 'Kings', 'are', 'reality', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'reality', 'Deadwood', 'detailed', 'DVD', 'extras', 'merely', 'starting', 'place', 'imaginative', 'spell', 'Milch', 'character', 'dialogue', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'obvious', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'are', 'deaf', 'dumb', 'blind', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'droll', 'dialogue', 'quirky', 'asides', 'convulted', 'plot', 'many', 'times', 'finds', 'numerous', 'side', 'trips', 'diversions', 'way', 'often', 'ambiguous', 'conclusion', 'So', 'be', 'it.Deadwood', 'obviously', 'not', 'tastes', 'delicate', 'sensibilities', 'need', 'not', 'apply', 'obsinately', 'brilliantly', 'profanely', 'eloquent', 'difficult', 'flawed', 'characters', 'priceless', 'dialogue', 'themes', 'big', 'small', 'who', 'love', 'ecentricities', 'proudly', 'feast', 'terrific', 'acting', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'marvelous', 'set', 'lit', 'photographed', 'directed', 'series', 'superior', 'most', 'films', 'let', 'alone', 'most', 'television', 'who', 'hate', 'who', 'love', 'Season', '3', 'even', 'more', 'eccentric', 'weird', 'God']",Deadwood: Season 2

It has a mayor and a sheriff, and the neighbouring territory of Dakota is expressing interest in annexing the nascent town.The second season of Deadwood is a partially successful extension of the themes of the first season. Order has arisen out of chaos, a new government and law for the town has been formed and people are starting to organise themselves. Deadwood is still a dangerous place - life remains cheap for many - but civilisation is coming. Against this backdrop Al Swearengen is still running shady deals but he has now become involved in political intrigue as he tries to get the best deal possible for the town. Sheriff Seth Bullock's interest in law and order is put aside as he tries to get to know the family he has inherited from his brother, whilst Joanie Stubbs's attempts to go solo and open her own whorehouse end in tragedy. There's a wider variety of storylines and characters in the second season, but they don't cohere as perfectly as they did in the first.The core problem is the essentiality of Ian McShane's presence as Al Swearengen to the success of the show. A curious decision was made to spend about three episodes on Swearengen being indisposed on account of kidney stones, meaning that for a quarter of the season its main protag/antagonist is all but absent, only appearing to pee some blood on the floor. Interesting for its attention to period detail (medicine in the 1870s was terrifyingly primitive), but hardly dramatically compelling. In McShane's absence, some of the thinness of the other character arcs becomes more apparent. Alma Garrett spends a dozen episodes sitting in her rooms not doing very much. Seth Bullock spends most of the season agonising over what to do about his relationship with his inherited wife and stepson (to the point of completely missing a prostitute-murdering killer being loose in the town). It's notable that the second season of Deadwood springs back to life when Swearengen returns to the front line, influencing an important part of history (Deadwood's acceptance into the USA and what territory it will join) from behind his office desk, negotiating deals with hugely important businessmen George Hearst and sorting out an internecine conflict within the Chinese community. Most of HBO's other classic shows succeed with broad ensemble casts, with no central role to hang the storyline on (The Wire, for example, had an entire year in which Dominic West's McNulty barely appeared and it was arguably the best season), but Deadwood falters in Swearengen's absence.That said, even a slightly disappointing season of Deadwood remains great television. As with the first season, the writing, characterisation and attention to detail are all superb. The dialogue is often a joy to listen to, and the show's morbid sense of humour results in laugh-out-loud moments. Alma's indecision over her future prospects is presented sympathetically, but with a true-to-the-period emphasis on realism over sentimentality. Bullock goes through a similar process. Both storylines are drawn out much too long, but are nevertheless explored well. More successful is the way the show presents Cy Tolliver as a man with the veneer of civilisation and decency, but with a seething, frustrated anger not far below the surface.The second season of Deadwood (****) remains compelling viewing, but definitely falters compared to the first year. The pacing feels sluggish at times and the back-room dealings over the camp's future feels like set-up more than the main course.

979165,AS558SNWF1DXG,B000EULSR0,Clare Quilty,"[7, 7]","Season Two shifts the ""Deadwood"" motor into a somewhat different gear.It moves slowly at first -- so slowly that I nearly cried ""sophomore slump"" and gave up on it. But before I realized it, by about the fourth episode, the show was achieving and in some ways eclipsing the heights of the first season.In this second installment, the town is growing, attracting more and more attention from the government and from the diabolically pragmatic prospector George Hearst. The characters, demonstrating a variation on ""nobody beats up my brother but me,"" begin to bond together in a reassuring way, and it's amusing to see Bullock and Swearengen (who nearly beat each other to death in episode one) form a strange kind of bond by the end.But don't foster any illusions that ""Deadwood"" gets warm and snuggly in its second season. If anything, the depiction of corruption and just plain old ickiness is even more pronounced. A running plot about Swearengen's agonized attempts to pass a kidney stone is one of the most excruciating situations I've ever seen depicted in series television; and in a weird way it's also one of the funniest.This is a show that's built solidly on its ensemble and there are so many great character actors (playing great characters) that it's hard to know where to start. Everybody's uniformly convincing and unique.If I had to pick two of the supporting cast, though, I'd start with Garret Dillahunt, who plays Wolcott, Hearst's geologist who brings to town both ""corporate"" corruption and his own psychotic tendencies. It's ironic that Dillahunt later played a stoner Jesus on the now-cancelled ""The Book of Daniel,"" because here he's basically the devil. His Wolcott is a cold, chilling, self-accepting performance that would've been astonishing even if Dillahunt hadn't earlier played a completely different kind of character on the show -- he was Jack McCall, who killed Bill in the first season -- but is completely unrecognizable in the new role.Robin Weigert -- wriggling deeper into the character of the endlessly irritable, perpetually inebriated Calamity Jane -- is also pretty amazing. I don't think she gets as much credit as she should, probably because what she's doing is so assured it almost doesn't seem like acting. Her quirks and personality as so well defined by Weigert, and so strangely endearing, that I think she fools viewers into thinking what she's doing is easy, but it can't possibly be.But the undeniable hub of the show is Ian McShane as Swearengen, who channels both Snidely Whiplash and Orson Welles and makes a complete [...] somehow likeable; and the rich, complex writing and plotting, which show no signs of flagging --the season finale, for example, pays off like a slot machine in its final moments and is one of my favorite episodes of TV, ever.",4,"Deeper into the mud, looking for the color",1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,2808,"['Season', 'Two', 'shifts', 'Deadwood', 'motor', 'somewhat', 'different', 'gear.It', 'moves', 'slowly', 'first', 'so', 'slowly', 'nearly', 'cried', 'sophomore', 'slump', 'gave', 'up', 'realized', 'fourth', 'episode', 'show', 'was', 'achieving', 'ways', 'eclipsing', 'heights', 'first', 'season.In', 'second', 'installment', 'town', 'growing', 'attracting', 'more', 'more', 'attention', 'government', 'diabolically', 'pragmatic', 'prospector', 'George', 'Hearst', 'characters', 'demonstrating', 'variation', 'nobody', 'up', 'brother', 'begin', 'bond', 'together', 'reassuring', 'way', 'amusing', 'see', 'Bullock', 'Swearengen', 'who', 'nearly', 'beat', 'other', 'death', 'one', 'form', 'strange', 'kind', 'bond', 'end.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'foster', 'illusions', 'Deadwood', 'warm', 'snuggly', 'second', 'season', 'anything', 'depiction', 'corruption', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'ickiness', 'even', 'more', 'pronounced', 'running', 'plot', 'Swearengen', 'agonized', 'attempts', 'pass', 'kidney', 'stone', 'one', 'most', 'excruciating', 'situations', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'depicted', 'series', 'television', 'weird', 'way', 'also', 'one', 'funniest.This', 'show', 'built', 'solidly', 'ensemble', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'playing', 'great', 'characters', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'start', 'Everybody', 'uniformly', 'convincing', 'unique.If', 'had', 'pick', 'two', 'supporting', 'cast', ""'d"", 'start', 'Garret', 'Dillahunt', 'who', 'Wolcott', 'Hearst', 'geologist', 'who', 'town', 'corporate', 'corruption', 'own', 'psychotic', 'tendencies', 'ironic', 'Dillahunt', 'later', 'played', 'stoner', 'Jesus', 'now-cancelled', 'Book', 'Daniel', 'here', 'basically', 'devil', 'Wolcott', 'cold', 'chilling', 'self-accepting', 'performance', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'astonishing', 'even', 'Dillahunt', 'had', ""n't"", 'earlier', 'played', 'completely', 'different', 'kind', 'character', 'show', 'was', 'Jack', 'McCall', 'who', 'killed', 'Bill', 'first', 'season', 'completely', 'unrecognizable', 'new', 'role.Robin', 'Weigert', 'wriggling', 'deeper', 'character', 'endlessly', 'irritable', 'perpetually', 'inebriated', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'also', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'much', 'credit', 'should', 'probably', 'what', 'doing', 'so', 'assured', 'almost', ""n't"", 'seem', 'acting', 'quirks', 'personality', 'so', 'well', 'defined', 'Weigert', 'so', 'strangely', 'endearing', 'think', 'viewers', 'thinking', 'what', 'doing', 'easy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be.But', 'undeniable', 'hub', 'show', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Swearengen', 'who', 'Snidely', 'Whiplash', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'complete', '[', 'somehow', 'likeable', 'rich', 'complex', 'writing', 'plotting', 'show', 'signs', 'flagging', 'season', 'finale', 'example', 'slot', 'machine', 'final', 'moments', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'TV', 'ever']",Deadwood: Season 2
979166,AGHJ9BMVMGIOL,B000EULSR0,colinwoodward,"[3, 5]","I loved season one, but it took me a while to watch all the episodes. Season two, however, I tore through rather quickly. That probably says it all: once you get into Deadwood, you can't stop. The story arch for season two concerns whether Deadwood will remain an ""outlaw"" camp or be incorporated into the Dakota or Montana territories. As complicated political and financial deals are being made right and left, the town makes some effort to become legitimate. The slimy hotel owner E. B. Farnum becomes ""mayor,"" and various town officials are appointed. If Deadwood's inhabitants make some attempts at becoming ""civilized,"" that doesn't prevent the bodies from piling up. Season two is just as bloody as season one. Things also get complicated when Sheriff Bullock's wife and adopted son show up announced. Subplots abound, such as Al Swearengen's medical woes, the battle between Woo and the ""San Francisco C---sucker,"" and a psychopath named Wolcott who works for a gold mining magnate who is interested in getting a piece of the action in Deadwood. Got all that? Season two is very good, though it lacks a bit of the first season's freshness, and none of the second season characters are as good as those introduced in season one. I was also disappointed that the show continues to insist on including artificial-sounding and unnecessary four, ten, and twelve-letter words, which bears little resemblence to how people actually talked in 1877. But, now that the show has established itself as profane, it can't cut back on the swearing without later shows seeming inconsistent. I was happy to see that in season two, Calamity Jane does more than just act as the town drunk, a role she held firm toward the end of season one and most of season two. I was also happy to see some black characters finally show up in Deadwood, but it looks as if they won't end up staying long. Although season two gets Byzantine at times, it is a worthy follow-up to season one. Deadwood remains a character actor's heaven, with the great Stephen Topolowsky showing up in season two as a corrupt Dakota commissioner. Ian McShane's Al Swearengen remains the show's centerpiece; when he falls ill and must remain in bed for much of season two, we miss him. He is Deadwood's Darth Vader--an evil man who seems to be going away from the dark side a bit as time goes by.

Why is the actor who played Jack McCall back with a beard on his face?  It's so obviously him that it ruins the new character.  This guy must be the producer's brother-in-law or something to come back as another person.  Lame.  Also the dialog in this season is jacked.  Put away the thesaurus, writers, and let people talk normal.  Half the time, it sounds like Mrs. Garrett slept with a subliminal ""vocabulary builder"" cassette playing in her headphones.  Another problem with this season is so many people are out of character.  Trixie can't say a line without the F word when she wasn't like that before.  Just listen and you've got to admit it sounds stupid, like a seventh-grader when he's learning to curse but can't do it the right way.  I'm a fan of dirty language and all, but I gotta laugh at some of these actors.  And what's with the overdubbed audio scenes where you hear a character talking like a narrator?  I think that takes away from the realism which the first season had.  Swearengen and his crew are still interesting, but I'm tired of the same old Bullock.  He doesn't look tough, makes tempermental, hasty decisions that would have buried him long ago, and I just can't buy him as the Mike Tyson of his day.  Maybe a gunfighter, but they don't make him out to be that.  I read what some others have said, that the actors contracts have not been renewed and Deadwood may not go on after the next season.  Maybe it's just as well.  Maybe the show has run its course like Oz.  I expect a Matrix-like decline from this point.

As a rapidly growing fan of Wild West cinema, I am mesmerized by the sharp revisionist approach that David Milch and company have taken. Guns are set aside as character, dialogue, and the look and feel of the gritty environment of the camp that's about to turn into a full-fledged town become the highlights of the show. The characters and their dialogue especially are what make this show. Seth Bullock, Al Swearengen, Calamity Jane, Doc Cochran, A.W. Merrick, Mr. Wu, and many others are memorable in their own right. The dialogue is some of the greatest I have ever heard on cable television. Modern-day Shakespeare becomes an untouchable art form.When I bought the first season of Deadwood, I instantly fell in love with the entire show. Its high quality made me a fan. The second season is even better than the first, though with a couple of exceptions. For one thing, since there is a much bigger cast of characters in all twelve episodes, some characters don't get as much attention as others. I wish I saw a little more of Doc Cochran, Charlie Utter, Sol Star, Trixie, Jewel, and Hostetler. Also, William Bullock seemed to be the only character who seems unnecessary in the series. But then again, he IS loosely based on Bullock's actual biological son, so I'll give the creators credit for that.Still, I can live with these minor flaws, as I truly believe that this is a brilliant second season. It's darker, grittier, wittier, and even more well-written than the first. In the end, however, I still love both seasons, though I give the second the slight edge.

979219,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000EULSR0,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 9]","I want to start this review with this. I've never liked westerns that much. I've never seen ""Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid"" or ""Dances With Wolves"".I liked ""Open Range"" but that's about as far as it goes. I started watching ""Deadwood"" when a friend recommended it. I started watching the first season via rental about two weeks before this season came out on DVD. After about 5 episodes of the first season I was hooked. This show is so good and there are so many good things about it. The dialogue is great, the action riveting, the characters are well drawn out and even the most evil characters you can't help but like. A lot of people associate ""Deadwood"" with ""that western show with lots of cussing."" Yes, there is a lot of cussing in this show and it works perfectly. The show is also very real; You'll never see a character wearing Nikes and the woman all have armpit hair. It's realistic, even when you don't want it to be. In the second season, older characters return and new characters come in. We even have an actor from the first season come back and play a different character. First off, I try to spare as many details as possible about episodes in my review because I feel it's best to watch the show without a preconceived notion of what's going to happen, but I'll give you a brief and to the point synopsis before giving my thoughts on each episode. In the first episode we see the return of Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert, who's really a talented actress who I look forward to seeing in movies after the third-and sadly last-season of Deadwood ends). We also get to witness a bloody and entertaining fight between saloon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane, who would win the Best Actor Oscar if this was a movie easily) and sheriff Seth Bullock (Timothy Olymphant). We also see Joanie Stubbs, the former hooker of The Bella Union temporarily open up her own brothel. Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe, who gives a great supporting performance and is very good at playing unstable characters) owner of The Bella Union is even worse off in this season in first. Whore Trixie becomes more of a lead character as she begins working in Bullock's hardware store alongside Sol Star (John Hawkes). Alma Garrett, still raising the young child Sofia, forms a sexual relationship with Bullock right as his wife & son show up. Also, Swearengen who was established as a thoroughly evil character in the first season turns out to be a pretty good guy this season while maintaining his nastiness. Anyway, this season (I think) is very superior to the first season...Except it'll spend as many as three episodes on one subject (urinary infections, death, etc.). All the actors are getting used to their roles and are almost becoming real people. As for the complaint that the same actor who played Jack McCall is now playing Francis Wolcott, I hardly noticed at first. It's obvious it's him, but it's not bothersome. The guy seems to be a character actor who can float in and out of episodes. Here are the episodes and my thoughs, but my final comment is...If you love westerns or have already watched ""Deadwood"" and love it. Buy this damned DVD set.1. A Lie Agreed Upon Pt.1-An explosive opener for the season. The best episode I've seen of Deadwood so far. There's a great sex scene between Seth Bullock & Alma Garret; There's a great fight scene between Seth Bullock & Al Swearengen; There's a great return of Calamity Jane, that keeps true to her characters. The dialogue is so good, this is really a spectacular episode.2. A Lie Agreed Upon Pt.2-Ian McShane is such an amazing actor. Al Swearengen is a terrific character who's got near perfect dialogue. Another great episode.3. New Money-This episode, for the most part, centers around a bladder problem Swearengen is having...These scenes where the doc has to remove stones and such from his bladder are painful to watch. Oh and P.S., why is the actor that played Jack McCall back in the show as a guy named Wolcott? He's not bad, but they could've gotten someone else.4. Requiem for a Gleet-Again, scenes involving Swearengen's bladder infection are painful to watch. Everytime Wu comes into The Gem though, it's pretty funny. Stephen Toblowsky (from ""Memento"") guest stars.5. Complications (Formerly Difficulties)-5/5-This is my favorite episode of 'Deadwood' out of the ones so far. The dialogue in this episode is very witty and well written. I like the Calamity Jane character more & more with every episode.6. Something Very Expensive-This episode is very intense and you find out that Wolcott is worse than Swearengen. It shows that the show is ready to go in a different direction.7. EB Was Left Out-This episode isn't my favorite, but the scene where Charlie Utter beats up Wolcott was very cool.8. Childish Things-This is one of the shortest episodes (48 minutes). I love the line Swearengen says to that teacher chick ""Thank you for brushing against my prick.""This episode is really good and introduces a Russian telegraph operator.9. Amalgation & Capital-A tragic event occurs. The score and the sequence of events leading up to this event (as well as the camera work) make this one of the saddest & most effective episodes.10. Advances, None Miraculous-This episode pretty much revolves around the tragedy that occured in the previous episode. It's pretty good, I guess.11. The Whores Can Come-While one can come up with all sorts of innuendo for this episode's title, it's not what you think. This episode is about the funeral of the person who died in the last episode. This one has it's moments, but overall is probably the weakest episode this season.12. Boy The Earth Talks To-This is a great season finale that leaves you cheering for the characters and waiting for the next season.GRADE: A+P.S.,I want to add that I'm happy the writers of the show decided to make the character of Mr. Wu bigger. He was in the first season for a few moments, but left such an impression and made me laugh so hard. I'm pleased to see him back.",5,Awesome,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,6000,"['want', 'start', 'review', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'much', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance',

I'm surprised that point hasn't been mentioned more, because it seems that Olyphant, on his episode commentaries, wasn't thrilled about it either, and I don't blame him.

979229,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000EULSR0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","The second season of HBO's ""Deadwood"" required some adjustments on the part of viewers because it was more of the same, only different.  The key dynamic of the first season was the arrival of Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) in Deadwood, intending to be a merchant opening a hardware franchise with his friend Sol Star (John Hawkes), but in the wake of the murder of Wild Bill Hickok ending up taking over the duties of sheriff from the inept Con Stapleton (Peter Jason).  The big question was what the assumption of this responsibility would do to his uneasy relationship with Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), the proprietor of the Gem Saloon and unofficial master of Deadwood.  However, Bullock's high and mighty attitude is at odds with his behavior with the widow Alma Garrett (Molly Barker), a hypocrisy that Swearengen will try to exploit.Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the second season is how quickly creator David Milch reverses the two key relationships that help define Bullock.  In the premier episode of the season, ""A Lie Agreed Upon, Part 1,"" Swearengen rides Bullock about his affair with Alma and the two ends up in a vicious fight that sends them off the balcony of the Gem to land hard in the streets, just as Bullock's wife, Martha (Anna Gunn), his brother's widow, and her son, William (Josh Eriksson) arrive on the stage.  Bullock has a broken nose and Swearengen broken ribs, and while both are temporarily out of action everybody in Deadwood assumes they are going to finish what they started.  In ""A Lie Agreed Upon, Part 2"" there is a great effort by his friends to keep Bullock from going back to the Gem to get his badge and gun, which he removed before the fistfight. But when Bullock calls Swearengen out, his badge and gun are returned to him, along with an apology from Al.  Suddenly, Bullock and Swearengen are on the same side, with the interest of the camp at heart.Meanwhile, the arrival of his wife and stepson have ended Bullock's affair with the widow Garrett, and from the intimacy of their last tryst in her hotel room a curtain of formality drops between them.  The only problem is that they are still enamored of each other and she turns out to be pregnant with his child, and being pregnant and unmarried is an unacceptable situation for a Victorian woman.  This change of affairs now puts the relationship between Sol and the prostitute Trixie (Paula Malcomson) into the forefront of the show on the romantic front, since the idea that Ellsworth (Jim Beaver) would propose to Alma to give her situation the appropriate cover of legitimacy, is not exactly a love story.  But then ""Deadwood"" was never exactly a romance.More importantly the politics and economics of the town are now in flux.  The arrival of a county commissioner from Yankton and the question of whether Deadwood would remain part of the Dakota Territory or become part of the Montana Territory, has Swearengen trying to play both sides to his advantage.  But politicians might be the least of Al's worries, as Francis Wolcott (Garret Dillahunt), agent for the mining magnate George Hearst (Gerald McRaney), arrives in town.  The plan is to make people think that the government is going to disallow claims, so that Wolcott can buy them cheap for Hearst, and Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe) and E.B. Farnum (William Sanderson) are enlisted in this cause.  However, Wolcott's predilection for cutting the throats of prostitutes who look at him when he does not want to be looked at, makes him an even bigger wild card.Things are changing quickly in Deadwood, but what stands out in this second season are the points where the action slows down and memorable episodes focus on Doc Cochran (Brad Dourif) trying to remove a kidney stone from Al (""New Money"") or the entire camp waiting for a injured child to die (""Advances None Miraculous"").  I also find it quite interesting that Joanie Stubbs (Kim Dickens) becomes the conscience of the town as she breaks from Tolliver and the Bella Union to open up her own brothel, Chez Ami.  That this would make Joanie and Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert) kindred spirits of a type is not surprising since the two women better represent the spirit of Deadwood than the likes of high class ladies like Alma and Martha (and with Trixie ministering to Al instead of looking out for Sofia, who is now with Alma, the spot is open for grabs)  The shifting shades of community become one of the most compelling aspects of ""Deadwood"" as the pieces on the chessboard get rearranged and the game develops.  There is more than constant swearing and great acting at work here.The audio commentaries are a mixed bag, but there are enough insights to make them worth listening to.  The final disc offers the most interesting bonus features, beginning with a featurette on ""The Real Deadwood 1877"" that allows historians to hold sway.  Then there are three looks at the ""Making of Season 2 Finale: Boy-the-Earth-Talks-To.""  The first ""Trusting the process with David Milch"" looks at how the show's creator works, whether lying on the floor of his office writing, rewriting, and rewriting again dialogue, or giving his actors background on a scene so they might have a chance of understanding some of what they are saying.  ""Mr. Wu Proves Out"" focuses on the staging of some key scenes, but the highlight becomes when actor Keone Young says to Milch that one day Wu should cut off his queue and Milch gets all excited and says they should do it this season (which they do, as We learns another word of English).  ""The Wedding Celebration"" is basically teaching the cast to dance for the big finale.  There is also a collection of ""Deadwood Daguerreotypes,"" with both historical photographs of the town and posed color portraits of some of the cast.",5,"Civilization is coming to Deadwood, but the

A Western based on the real town in the Dakotas is a work of  art.  Based partly on truth and mixed in with fiction, Seth Bullock comes to town to begin a business with his friend Sol Starr.  He soon finds himself up against an evil saloon proprietor named Al Swearengen.  In this season, Seth finally admits he loves Alma and discovers his wife has come to town at the same time.  He devotes himself to his wife and stepson and turns his back on Alma who is now pregnant with his child.  Al in the meantime is witnessing the changes in the camp such as the introduction of the telegraph.  Other characters are going through changes also.

There is no other TV show, barring perhaps 'The Wire', which is written with such a keen ear for dialogue and with such fleshed out characters. Season 2 is just as good, if not better, than the first series. It moves with slightly more pace and some of the more interesting characters, such as Cy Tolliver and Alma Garrett, are explored in greater depth. Tolliver - played by the incredible Powers Boothe - truly becomes a force to be reckoned with in this second series. The powerplays between him and Al Swearengen make for some of the most interesting television one could hope to see.Among other things, we see in season two the return of Bullock's wife and son; the softer side of Al Swearengen; a sadistic geologist with a keen eye for gold; and blood-letting between Mr. Wu and a chinese rival from San Francisco. Throughout, we are treated to a healthy dose of Deadwood's trademark violence and profanity, the latter of which rolls of the tongue with surprising eloquence. Swearengen makes certain curse words sound as if they are as natural as 'if', 'and' or 'but'.Ultimately, the most outstanding features of this series are the following:1) Al Swearengen - again, as in the first series, Ian McShane is amazing.2) Cy Tolliver - Powers Boothe devours every scene he's in.3) Seth Bullock - Timothy Olyphant's sheriff walks the streets of Deadwood like a cauldron about to teem with furious anger.

Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) is now the sheriff of the lawless town, and Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) continues to have his firm grip on the town.  Leading up to an inevitable knock down, drag out showdown between the two, the stage is set for this excellent second season of one of the best shows HBO has ever conjured up.  There's a number of sub-plots throughout the season, including Bullock's affair with Alma (Molly Parker) getting further complicated when his estranged wife comes to town, as well as Swearengen's failing health, and Cy's (Powers Boothe) ulterior motives that always feature an ace up his sleeve.  There's a newcomer to the town as well, who has some ulterior motives of his own, and enjoys murdering prostitutes.  The Doc (Brad Dourif), E.B. (Will Sanderson), and Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert) are all here in fine form as well.  The performances from everyone involved are once again great, and McShane is his usual excellent, award winning self as one of the most engaging television villains of all time.  As expected by anyone who viewed and enjoyed the first season, the second season of Deadwood is every bit as violent and gritty as one could expect.  Those who have been giving the series one star reviews are constantly bringing up the fact of the constant swearing throughout every episode.  It's true, it can get overdone and redundant, but this is the old West after all, and when every day is a battle for survival, you're bound to swear a lot for one reason or another.

Season 2 continues with the same intensity but with more ""oomph"".From the 1st episode right to the 12th, the writers give us a story that never fails to excite and invoke emotion. While in Season 1, events happen on a more personal level...now changes happen that involves the camp as a whole. Deadwood's vast gold resources draws the interest of many people of power. Several districts are vying for Deadwood to be under their territory, namely Yankton. Al Swearengen makes a pact with the sheriff, Seth Bullock and manipulates the situation to his benefit, so that he doesn't lose control to a government consisting of unknown poeple who will take advantage of the riches Deadwood has to offer. Gold mining is big business now, complete with massive equipment. Millionaire investor, George Hearst sends his agent, Francis Wolcott to buy claims of the gold from the hoopleheads to expand his investment. Wolcott allies with Tolliver to help him secure the gold claims. Joanie Stubbs, once working with Tolliver starts her own brothel with an acquaintance of hers, Maddie. Seth's wife and child joins him in Deadwood. Alma Garret is busy working her gold claim through Ellsworth. She is in love with Seth Bullock, and vice versa but responsibilities keep them from being together. If you think that's a lot to digest, it's just the icing on a cake. Many other things happen along the way, and it just makes you starve for more.The writing is flawless as usual. The story is great and there's no wasting time. It goes straight to the point that the writers intend to make, and they drive it through like nails. Changes are risky but fortunately, the way they are implemented here is superb and very gradual...so it doesn't seem fake or preconceived. For example, where previously the people of Deadwood got what they want through brute force, now there are more negotiations, partly because the playing field is larger due to outside interests. It's amazing that the flow of the story is very natural, as well as the continuity. The acting is also top notch. Ian McShane, Timothy Olyphant, Molly Parker and basically everyone in the show give award-worthy performances.In short, another fantastic season of Deadwood and the pace of the series shows no signs of slowing down. Where Season 1 introduced us to the characters of Deadwood, that we have since come to love...Season 2 expands the story to a whole new level.

979259,A1TUDEC66M9FO3,B000EULSR0,Preston C. Enright,"[4, 88]","""Deadwood"" does a good job of portraying how violent and depraved Western Civilization can be.  After slaughtering the Native people, or sending them off on forced marches, etc., people made a living scrambling around for gold in them thar' hills.  Same story in California and other places.  In fact, it's the same story today, where mining firms like Newmont (located in Denver) turn ecosystems of indigenous people into dead zones.  Once the local economies and ways of life are destroyed, people struggle to get by through working for the mining firms, or the lumber companies, or for the massive hydroelectric projects.  Corruption of politicians helps the projects go forward, oftentimes officials are seduced via sexual favors.  All this is exposed in ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man""Confessions of an Economic Hit Manby John Perkins.  Although, when someone reads a book by Perkins, or maybe ""Resource Rebels"" by Al Gedicks, there is nothing appealling about it.  ""Deadwood"" seems to try to normalize and even glamorize the worst of human behavior.It's kind of sad to consider all of the youth, not just in this country, but around the world, who will view these DVDs and come away thinking that being a thug or a prostitute is the way to go.  The objectification of women and the crude language will be another regressive contribution toward our sick society.  There's a scene where a character says ""A lot of screaming comes from Al's room.""  Al is a character who some reviewers feel is likable.  That he sexually brutalizes and exploits women doesn't impress me.The gun, tobacco and liquor industries must really appreciate all the product placement they receive in this series.  I imagine the directors probably received some bags of money for their efforts.I guess I was hoping for something thoughtful and well-written like ""Northern Exposure""Northern Exposure - Seasons 1-3 Bundleor ""Six Feet Under""Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set.  Instead, just endless moments of depravity.  I guess it makes the violent and corrupt corporatists of today feel good about themselves and their role in the world, kind of like how ""The Sopranos"" celebrates the worst sort of human.How people come to see this sort of thing as entertaining is beyond me.Maybe I'm missing something, and I'll watch a few more episodes to see if something worthwhile comes from this show.  It all seems very negative to me, and it's kind of fitting that another reviewer expressed his anger over the show being cancelled by saying he wanted to ""put a bullet in the head of an HBO executive.""  That's exactly the sort of energy this show casts off - violence and aggression - along with deceit and greed.  The same is found in Shakespeare, which is probably why we're all supposed to worship him in Western Civilization; but writers like Rumi, Thich Nhat Hanh, Joseph Campbell and Alice Walker are more my speed.  If people are so fascinated by violence and corruption, they should check out the writings of William Blum.  I doubt his ""Killing Hope"" will be turned into a tv series, but at least people can feel a bit closer to the action since we invest our tax dollars in the bullets and cluster bombs.Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II-Updated Through 2003My hope was to at least find this program bearable enough to use as a tool to study Spanish.  I use the audio options to read Spanish subtitles, or to hear the Spanish dubbing and read the English; but Deadwood is just so ugly and boring that I think I'll re-watch episodes of Six Feet Under, Mystery Science Theater 3000 and Weeds instead.",1,Repulsive and boring.,1175385600,"04 1, 2007",2007,3629,"['Deadwood', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'how', 'violent', 'depraved', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'can', 'be', 'slaughtering', 'Native', 'people', 'sending', 'off', 'forced', 'marches', 'etc.', 'people', 'made', 'living', 'scrambling', 'gold', 'thar', 'hills', 'Same', 'story', 'California', 'other', 'places', 'fact', 'same', 'story', 'today', 'where', 'mining', 'firms', 'Newmont', 'located', 'Denver', 'turn', 'ecosystems', 'indigenous', 'people', 'dead', 'zones', 'local', 'economies', 'ways', 'life', 'are', 'destroyed', 'people', 'struggle', 'get', 'working', 'mining', 'firms', 'lumber', 'companies', 'massive', 'hydroelectric', 'projects', 'Corruption', 'politicians', 'helps', 'projects', 'go', 'forward', 'oftentimes', 'officials', 'are', 'seduced', 'sexual', 'favors', 'exposed', 'Confessions', 'Economic', 'Hit', 'Man', 'Confessions', 'Economic', 'Hit', 'Manby', 'John', 'Perkins', 'when', 'someone', 'book', 'Perkins', 'maybe', 'Resource', 'Rebels', 'Al', 'Gedicks', 'nothing', 'appealling', 'Deadwood', 'try', 'normalize', 'even', 'glamorize', 'worst', 'human', 'behavior.It', 'kind', 'sad', 'consider', 'youth', 'not', 'just', 'country', 'world', 'who', 'will', 'view', 'DVDs', 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'being', 'thug', 'prostitute', 'way', 'go', 'objectification', 'women', 'crude', 'language', 'will', 'be', 'regressive', 'contribution', 'sick', 'society', 'scene', 'where', 'character', 'A', 'lot', 'screaming', 'Al', 'room', 'Al', 'character', 'who', 'reviewers', 'feel', 'likable', 'sexually', 'women', ""n't"", 'impress', 'me.The', 'gun', 'tobacco', 'liquor', 'industries', 'must', 'really', 'appreciate', 'product', 'placement', 'receive', 'series', 'imagine', 'directors', 'probably', 'received', 'bags', 'money', 'efforts.I', 'guess', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'thoughtful', 'well-written', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'Bundleor', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Gift', 'Set', 'Instead', 'just', 'endless', 'moments', 'depravity', 'guess', 'violent', 'corrupt', 'corporatists', 'today', 'feel', 'good', 'role', 'world', 'kind', 'how', 'Sopranos', 'worst', 'sort', 'human.How', 'people', 'come', 'see', 'sort', 'thing', 'entertaining', 'me.Maybe', ""'m"", 'missing', 'something', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'see', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'show', 'very', 'negative', 'kind', 'fitting', 'reviewer', 'expressed', 'anger', 'show', 'being', 'cancelled', 'saying', 'wanted', 'put', 'bullet', 'head', 'HBO', 'executive', 'exactly', 'sort', 'energy', 'show', 'off', 'violence', 'aggression', 'deceit', 'greed', 'same', 'found', 'Shakespeare', 'probably', 'why', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'worship', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'writers', 'Rumi', 'Thich', 'Nhat', 'Hanh', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'Alice', 'Walker', 'are', 'more', 'speed', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'fascinated', 'violence', 'corruption', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'writings', 'William', 'Blum', 'doubt', 'Killing', 'Hope', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'tv', 'series', 'least', 'people', 'can', 'feel', 'bit', 'closer', 'action', 'invest', 'tax', 'dollars', 'bullets', 'cluster', 'bombs.Killing', 'Hope', 'U.S.', 'Military', 'CIA', 'Interventions', 'World', 'War', 'II-Updated', '2003My', 'hope', 'was', 'least', 'find', 'program', 'bearable', 'enough', 'use', 'tool', 'study', 'Spanish', 'use', 'audio', 'options', 'read', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'hear', 'Spanish', 'dubbing', 'read', 'English', 'Deadwood', 'just', 'so', 'ugly', 'boring', 'think', ""'ll"", 're-watch', 'episodes', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'Weeds', 'instead']",Deadwood: Season 2

979262,A1KG5KFO32ALHP,B000EULSR0,Randy Gibson,"[2, 2]","This is a review of the Season 2 package being offered by HBO.  As to the series, if you have watched Deadwood, then like most viewers, you either love it or hate it.  For some, the language and violence are insurmountable obstacles for enjoyment.  For others, the air of realism and authenticity, even with an anachronistic swearing vocabulary, make the show excellent.  Rather than review the show itself, let me take a moment to review this particular DVD package.  To begin with, the packaging itself is rather appealing.  The hard-cover box with the folio carrier for the DVDs looks nice on the shelf and is very durable and protective of the discs.  The transfers on all 12 episodes are excellent quality, typical of HBO and the audio is some of the best quality I've seen on DVD versions.  Deadwood relies heavily on acoustic music which is very well soundtracked to these discs.  The extras include audio commentary on 9 episodes and unlike many shows, the audio commentaries come from a wide variety of cast and crew members. Based on what is included in some series' you would expect commentary from Ian McShane, Timothy Olyphant, and David Milch on every episode.  In this case, you hear from 13 different members of the cast and crew which adds a great deal of insight into the actors' and producers' viewpoints on this compelling drama.  As in the first season package, there is a feature on the real 1877 Deadwood and also a ""making of"" surrounding the season finale.  The package includes English, French, and Spanish audio versions in Dolby and surround.  Overall, this is a very well-made DVD package with some truly nice added features.  If you just want to re-experience the second sesason of the show, it is well worth the purchase price.  But the commentaries and other features certainly add a great deal of value.

979263,A2HJB9J5O5CLPB,B000EULSR0,R. A Rubin,"[5, 7]","Ian McShane certainly steals this ensemble Western.  His cunning and ruthlessness are believable.  His steel black eyes bear down on weaker subjects, brow beating, so violence is not always necessary.  Big Al doesn't mind messing with an employee now and then, cruelly testing a bartender or working girl. Though he surrounds himself with cutthroats and moneygrubbers, one is never sure that the end game for Al is just gold.The writing, the dialogue of Deadwood seems to come out of a Victorian novel.  There's hints of Shakespearean history plays, say Henry V in the witty repartee and double entendre's that whirl about complicated plots and sub-plots inferring a visceral grasp for mastery or survival. The legends of the dime story are pranced about the saloons of Deadwood, Wild Bill Hitchcock or Calamity Jane.  Timothy Olyphant plays a Wyatt Earp type sheriff and businessman, a figure of virtue; yet, as all the characters in Deadwood, Olyphant is not above adultery or vengeance murder, nor does he over think allegiances with cold blooded gangsters like Ian McShane.Here is the POST-MODERN revision of Western history as it is taught by Humanities Departments of our major Universities to our slack-jawed children.

I'll add to the chorus proclaiming this as one of the best things on TV ever. Be warned, though, that while season 1 was no ""stroll in the park"", season 2 is one of the darkest seasons I've ever seen on TV.And not just emotionally dark.  Do you remember Apocalypse Now, how the film started sun-drenched and overly bright, and gradually the film's palette grew darker? Deadwood 2 feels very much like that.  Much more of this season is cast in darkness and shadow. Even the daylight outdoors scenes are darker than season 1.  And the mood and tone is incredibly dark.  Season 1 had more than its share of brutality.  Season 2 not only ramps up the brutality, but adds a lot of suffering to the mix.  There is pain in this season, to strip your heart like turpentine, and very little of joy.  The tonal darkness, the character's emotional darkness, and the coming political darkness all combine in a pretty harrowing fashion.But there is transcendence and magnificence in abundance.  It continues as one of the most incandescent shows ever filmed, and all the lead actors from season 1 return in stellar fashion.  What is most striking in season 2 is how the women shine.

979270,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000EULSR0,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 0]","This a wonderful and essential addition to the finest series on the Wild West that I have ever seen.  With the characters and situation established, the series really hits its stride in this season.  Swearengen and Bullock are the two principal characters, who after a brutal confrontation arrive at a kind of tactical alliance against other influences in the town and in favor of its development.  While they remain themselves as consistent characters, this introduces a shade of gray into the body politic, but their adversaries seem much much worse, from the mysterious Hearst to his strange henchman.In terms of plot, the town is making big strides toward joining S. Dakota, but it is also becoming a major source of gold, attracting many fortune seekers and organizers.  To the credit of the writers and direction, what is happening in the maneuverings is not completely spelled out, leaving it to the viewer to piece it together over multiple viewings.  I find this a delightful thinking task to unravel the political machinations.  It also interests to search back to the real history - I discovered to my astonishment that most of the characters are based on historical figures, which I had assumed only made cameo appearences, like Wild Bill Hickock and Calamity Jane.  (Check out wikipedia in this regard.)  It got me to buy a bunch more books from Amazon, to learn more.  Of course, there is much that is added as fiction or is simply inaccurate, but it is stimulating and another layer that is extremely fun.There is also much development of the secondary characters, such as a call girl, EB Farnum, or the doctor.  The actors are so good that they bring real pathos to the story.  Bullock's family is also a major theme, with his unloved wife and her son moving as representatives into the soul of the city.  There is tragedy and development, all realistic and tough.I will watch these again and again.  HBO has accomplished a great new kind of narrative of the West.

Bloody, sexy, funny and sad, Season Two offers plenty of surprises for fans still thunderstruck from Season One.Season Two opens about seven months or so after the close of the first season.  Sheriff Bullock (Tim Olyphant) and saloon-owner/prime mover-and-shaker Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) have settled into an uneasy alliance, but one as fragile and explosive as nitroglycerine.  A harsh look and some brash talk set these two at their throats in the very first episode.  It's no secret that Bullock's nerves are shot, as his affair with Alma Garrett (Molly Parker) is about to be terminated by the imminent arrival of his wife (Anna Gunn).The various sub-plots of the camp continue to roil and seethe.  The continued prosperity of the camp has attracted the eyes of the outside world.  Montana and Dakota are jockeying to annex the camp for statehood, and Swearengen and Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe) try to work the necessary angles to make sure they won't get lost in the shuffle.  George Hearst, the most successful and ruthless gold miner in the West, has sent his representative to scout out the town and use ruthless methods to acquire mining claims . . . and this representative is a ""specialist"" with the local prostitutes.  Trixie and Sol Starr continue their ""relationship.""  Doc continues his lonely war for the virtue of the camp.  There is even a battle for the alleys and shanties of the Chinese community in town. And Calamity Jane continues her struggles with the bottle and the death of her friend, Wild Bill Hickock.This series is far to vast to be adequately summarized here.  Suffice it to say that ""Deadwood"" continues to offer some of the most colorful and insightful writing on TV, and the cast does an excellent job capturing the essence of frontier life in 19th century America in all its varied forms.Several cast commentaries highlight various aspects of the show, including the actors' collective ignorance as to what is going on.  Aaron Sorkin was notorious for providing scripts to his actors that were still warm from the printer - David Milch does much the same here, but his scripts are much more complex and subtle.  There is also a great DVD extra showing how hard Milch actually works writing this stuff, lying on the floor reworking line after line of dialogue until it is just right.If you haven't seen the show yet, get Season One immediately.

Deadwood has revived the genre, though, ugh, crudely, quite muddily and with crowds on the street thicker than 5th ave and 34th st at 5pm in New York.The 2nd season is drags a bit and along with the profanity, there is much flowery westernese Shakespearian speech that if one does not listen closely; one will not understand what the heck they just said.Swearingen', that ol' villain of the Gem Saloon.  He built up quite a reputation as a vile  evil murderer in the 1st season who would just as soon stick a knife in a visitor's guts as well as shake their hand, depending upon his mood.  He evolves quickly in the 2nd season into a cantankerous, yet grudgingly lovable character one would not mind having for an odd black sheep uncle.The real Swearingen, if the ""Real Deadwood"" sites are to be believed, beat his prostitutes frequently. He lured young women into the business from distant places with promises of stardom and if they failed to live up to carnal expectations, were kicked out into the street to starve. Perhaps such wickedness is just a little too wicked for a major character, even a reprobate one.The funeral episode seemed a little forced. This is a town where, when most folks die, get dumped into a Chinese hog pen, and no one seems to notice. The newly arrived Bullock kid is around for a couple of episodes, gets stomped by a horse and everybody cannot help but NOTICE (maybe there was some unseen 11 episodes off screen or not on the DVDs where the Bullock kid went around and became well known and beloved by the entire town). People were coming out of the brothels, the mines, woodworks and waterworks to come to this funeral. I did find, though, scripture readings and the grieving mother scene where she changes her mind about the viewing, rather touching.The wedding episode was comical towards the end and perhaps even ""camp."" This was the season finale of the 12 episode series and it seemed a rush to tidy everything up.

Another glimpse of this dangling person is seen later on, and I presume it is a quick plot device to dispose of one of the series razor villains without wasting a potentially interesting future episode on him. He could have just as well ended the series as declaring he was on his way to London to `pursue exotic tastes in English belles"" and one would be left wondering if the guy was ""Jack the Ripper"".

979299,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B000EULSR0,Wanda B. Red,"[2, 2]","In season two, ""Deadwood"" gains the courage of its own convictions and starts to explore the world it's created with even greater power and subtlety than it did in season one. Truly magnificent TV, downright Shakespearean. In fact, Swearingen's growing habit in this season of addressing his privatemost thoughts to a box with the Injun chief's head in it reminds one of Iago's or Macbeth's soliloquies. Cy Tolliver also shows how mesmerizing a truly vicious man can be. Both Ian McShane as Swearingen and Powers Booth as Tolliver are snarlingly brilliant. And Molly Parker really grows into the role of the widow Alma Garrett, as she perfectly balances innocence, passion, playfulness, and restraint.Other actors who deserve special mention are Brad Dourif as the cranky, principled Doc Cochran, and William Sanderson, whose portrayal of E.B. Farnum is deliciously histrionic.The language in ""Deadwood"" is one of its great achievements. The over-the-top profanity conceals other purposes. It makes the characters seem gritty and almost primitive. At the same time, they can handle the elaborate periodic sentence along with the quickest witted of Shakespeare's characters or those of the other classic author I'm put in mind of: Dickens. What a seductive, baroque smorgasbord of effects creator and executive producer David Milch serves up here!

979300,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000EULSR0,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[15, 17]","With the third season of ""Deadwood"" being the last let's hope that creator/writer/producer/director David Milch can tie up all the loose ends to the series that he set up during season two. The second season of ""Deadwood"" starts with a tussle--Sheriff Seth Bollock (Timothy Olyphant) takes on Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) in a nasty, bloody fight when Swearengen insults Alma Garret (Molly Parker) in front of the residents of the town. Bollock's affair with Garret takes an unexpected turn when Bollock's wife (also the widow of his brother)and step son(also his nephew) arrive in town unexpectantly. Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe) and Al increasingly come into conflict over their rival whorehouse business and a sociopath, ruthless mining agent (Garret Dillahunt) who works for George Hearst changes the life of whorehouse owners Maddie (Alice Krige) and Joanie (Kim Dickens) when he begins frequenting their business.All of this happens in just the first episode of season two! Things will get worse before they get better for most of the residents of Deadwood as prospectors continue to pour into the mineral rich town.Once again dominated by marvelous, stunning performances particularly from McShane, Olyphant, Boothe, Robin Weigert (as Calamity Jane) and Paula Malcomson (Trixie) the second season of ""Deadwood"" lacks the shock value of the first but the plotting, direction and writing are equally as good with sharper character development for the main characters. There isn't a weak link in this stunning cast (I mentioned the above members of the cast only because they had more than one stand out episode) and ""Deadwood"" is what ""The Sopranos"" used to be--cutting edge TV without regrets. David Milch's combination of drama and history is stunning looking with its rich production design and authentic characterizations.A truly stunning transfer ""Deadwood"" is easily a DVD reference standard with deep, rich blacks almost nonexistent digital artifacts and rich, deep colors that capture the authentic rustic look of the show. The 5.1 soundtrack makes excellent use of the surround channels and dialogue is crystal clear. Part of the quality is due to the fact there are never more than 3 episodes per disc allowing plenty of bit space for the visual and audio elements but that also contributes to the cost of the set as well. You're getting and paying for quality with these sets. There are chapter placements after the opening titles of each episode which is a big plus for those fans who want to skip ahead.We get a number of commentary tracks from the actors and writer/producer David Milch and director-producer Greg Feinberg. Among the best commentary tracks is the one on ""A Lie Agreed Upon Part I"" with actors Ian McShane and timothy Olyphant. The two clearly enjoy each other's company and have an infectious blast discussing the making of the episode. Actresses Molly Parker and Anna Gunn provide a second commentary track on the same episode and while it isn't as fun as McShane and Olyphant it is full of insight about the show and the episode. The other highlight are the two commentary tracks on  ""The Whores Can Come"" which features Olymphant paired with Gunn and McShane with Malcomson. It generates much of the same fun and informative atmosphere that dominates the commentaries on the opening episode. There are 7 other commentary tracks each quite good but none can really compare to these two. Even producer/writer David Milch's commentary lacks the firepower and fun atmosphere of these two commentary tracks with his being amount the least involving of the 9 included here.The last disc like the first set has the featurettes. ""The Real Deadwood 1977-Historical Featurette"" is a companion piece to the first season featurette on the history of the town. We get a nice mix of historians, Milch and other production staff discussing the real vs. fictional world. ""Making of Episode 12: Boy-the-Earth Talks-To"" is a three part documentary about the making of the 12th episode of the season. ""Trusting the Process with David Milch"" allows us into the creative process as we watch Milch at work crafting the one of the episodes. ""Mr. Wu Proves Out"" details the subplot involving Wu and Swearengen and their complex relationship. ""The Wedding Celebration"" details the intricate planning that goes into the a wedding that is a highlight of the season finale. We also get a photo gallery of the characters and real Deadwood. There's also some HBO previews at the beginning of the first disc.While the shock and uniqueness that highlighted the first season are gone the second season carries on with a series of brilliantly written and performed episodes. The characters are richer during the second season and the plot twists as convoluted as can be imagined making season two equally as good if not better than the first season of the show. The extras are generous given that this is a cable show being brought to DVD and the packaging/transfer is deluxe as well.

I liked that one to, but part of the way in I wasn't sure where it was going. It sort of lagged, seemingly unsure just what it had gotten itself into. In this one, though, there's a clear movement forward from the start - even if the plot is quite convoluted. It feels like the writers and the actors have really settled into the skin of the characters and the setting. They speak and act wonderfully, each of them representing different areas of society, speaking differently depending on who they're speaking too, etc. Very well done. I'm looking forward to what comes next and ever so thankful that HBO has the guts to do programs like this. Who would've thought a cable channel would end up making some of the best stuff out there - even better and grittier than much of what's on the big screen these days?",5,Great season,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,892,"['enjoyed', 'season', 'very', 'much', 'found', 'more', 'cohesive', 'first', 'season', 'liked', 'one', 'part', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'sort', 'lagged', 'seemingly', 'unsure', 'just', 'what', 'had', 'gotten', 'one', 'though', 'clear', 'movement', 'forward', 'start', 'even', 'plot', 'quite', 'convoluted', 'writers', 'actors', 'have', 'really', 'settled', 'skin', 'characters', 'setting', 'speak', 'act', 'wonderfully', 'representing', 'different', 'areas', 'society', 'speaking', 'differently', 'depending', 'who', ""'re"", 'speaking', 'too', 'etc', 'Very', 'well', 'done', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'what', 'next', 'ever', 'so', 'thankful', 'HBO', 'guts', 'do', 'programs', 'Who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'cable', 'channel', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'best', 'stuff', 'there', 'even', 'better', 'grittier', 'much', 'what', 'big', 'screen', 'days']",Deadwood: Season 2

It's too bad that it has to sell itself to sex and profanity starved people in order to survive.For Example, ""High Noon"" starring Gary Cooper is the best western ever made and it has not sex or profanity, just great acting, a great story and great music.  I would recommend that people avoid this series like the plague until the writers and produces stop relying on the aformention central theme of how cool non-stop profanity sound in someone's living room.JMSt Paul",1,Deadwood for deadheads,1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,564,"['overuse', 'profanity', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'really', 'what', 'Deadwood', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'too', 'bad', 'sell', 'sex', 'profanity', 'starved', 'people', 'order', 'survive.For', 'Example', 'High', 'Noon', 'starring', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'best', 'western', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'sex', 'profanity', 'just', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'music', 'would', 'recommend', 'people', 'avoid', 'series', 'plague', 'writers', 'stop', 'relying', 'aformention', 'central', 'theme', 'how', 'cool', 'non-stop', 'profanity', 'sound', 'someone', 'living', 'room.JMSt', 'Paul']",Deadwood: Season 2
