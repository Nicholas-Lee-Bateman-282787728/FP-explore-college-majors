A lot of this harkens back to it's theatrical release when there was a lot of anticipation for gold and silver to be released and to see Lugia on the big screen, wow.  Looking back on it, I really like the mythology behind it.  Although it shares no real canon to the television series, I think that this movie made it seem on a grander scale.  Like the world was really in danger.  I don't know that I care too much for the title of the main movie, ""The Power of One,"" I think it gives too much away.  I also don't think that Ash truly was the power of one considering he had all the help he had.  I mean, he couldn't have done that by himself.  The true lesson seems to be that you need allies.

528557,A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A,B00003CXLM,"Bruce Gray ""gurpsgm""","[3, 4]","In the second theatrical release of the Pokemon series, we are given nothing but an environmental disaster for Ash and friends to solve - and this makes it quite a bit less great than the first movie.  This would have been much better as a multi-part episode of the TV series.If you're unfamiliar with the basics, Pokemon (short for ""POcKEt MONsters"") are creatures a little like those from this world, but with strange and unusual powers and abilities that they use for their masters - masters that can be either good or evil.  Ash and his friends train their Pokemon to fight battles with their enemies.  They travel all over the planet to collect new and unusual types of Pokemon.  They trap Pokemon in ""Poke Balls"" - a small device that hangs from a belt.  When Ash's enemies release their Pokemon to do their work, Ash and his friends release their Pokemon, and they have a big battle.The environmental message in this story is just about shouted out loud and clear.  This heavy handedness in story and plot makes it less enjoyable to begin with.  Then, to make matters worse, there's a section near the beginning of the movie that almost comes right out and tells you the plot for the rest of the movie.  If I had know that this was the case, I could have turned it off right then.Ash and his friends must save the three legendary bird Pokemon Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres from the clutches of an evil Pokemon collector.  But the ""evil"" of the collector is only superficial at best - we are given no reasons for his obsession with ""Gotta Catch Em All"" other than the collector's card that he both begins and ends the movie with.  He doesn't seem nearly as threatening as the menace of MewTwo.  And there's almost no resolution to his story - he is left with exactly what he stared with and does not seem to regret his evil ways, nor does he seem to care that he was ultimately responsible for the environmental disasters that faced Earth.Meanwhile, Lugia must help Ash replace the three orbs on the island where they belong while flying through the fight between the three legendary birds and the environmental damage that they have created.  Ash's life is in jeopardy again, and after the first movie, you would think that the Powers That Be would come up with a more original plot.  What's worse is that the message is presented in such a way that it Cannot Be Ignored, which is always a plot device that I have hated.  There's not any story for parents to love in this one unless they're members of Greenpeace.My favorite part of this movie was the few scenes where the original Team Rocket, Jessie and James, have a change of heart and must side with their former enemies Ash and friends.  I sometimes wonder why those two have never learned the error of their ways.  This was the only saving grace of this movie.There's also another Pikachu cartoon in this one that fans of the TV show will enjoy, but parents will find a herd time making any sense of the Pokemon ""talk"".Not nearly as highly rated as the first movie - in fact I only recommended it for Pokemon fans.",3,Not nearly as good as the first.,1052870400,"05 14, 2003",2003,3078,"['second', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Pokemon', 'series', 'are', 'given', 'nothing', 'environmental', 'disaster', 'Ash', 'friends', 'solve', 'quite', 'bit', 'less', 'great', 'first', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'multi-part', 'episode', 'TV', 'series.If', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'basics', 'Pokemon', 'short', 'POcKEt', 'MONsters', 'are', 'little', 'world', 'strange', 'unusual', 'powers', 'abilities', 'use', 'masters', 'masters', 'can', 'be', 'either', 'good', 'evil', 'Ash', 'friends', 'train', 'Pokemon', 'fight', 'battles', 'enemies', 'travel', 'planet', 'collect', 'new', 'unusual', 'types', 'Pokemon', 'trap', 'Pokemon', 'Poke', 'Balls', 'small', 'device', 'belt', 'When', 'Ash', 'enemies', 'release', 'Pokemon', 'do', 'work', 'Ash', 'friends', 'release', 'Pokemon', 'have', 'big', 'battle.The', 'environmental', 'message', 'story', 'just', 'about', 'shouted', 'out', 'loud', 'clear', 'heavy', 'handedness', 'story', 'plot', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'begin', 'Then', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'section', 'beginning', 'movie', 'almost', 'right', 'tells', 'plot', 'rest', 'movie', 'had', 'know', 'was', 'case', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'off', 'right', 'then.Ash', 'friends', 'must', 'save', 'three', 'legendary', 'bird', 'Pokemon', 'Articuno', 'Zapdos', 'Moltres', 'clutches', 'evil', 'Pokemon', 'collector', 'evil', 'collector', 'only', 'superficial', 'best', 'are', 'given', 'reasons', 'obsession', 'Got', 'ta', 'Catch', 'Em', 'All', 'other', 'collector', 'card', 'begins', 'movie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'nearly', 'as', 'threatening', 'menace', 'MewTwo', 'almost', 'resolution', 'story', 'left', 'exactly', 'what', 'stared', 'not', 'seem', 'regret', 'evil', 'ways', 'seem', 'care', 'was', 'ultimately', 'responsible', 'environmental', 'disasters', 'faced', 'Earth.Meanwhile', 'Lugia', 'must', 'help', 'Ash', 'replace', 'three', 'orbs', 'island', 'where', 'belong', 'flying', 'fight', 'three', 'legendary', 'birds', 'environmental', 'damage', 'have', 'created', 'Ash', 'life', 'jeopardy', 'again', 'first', 'movie', 'would', 'think', 'Powers', 'Be', 'would', 'come', 'up', 'more', 'original', 'plot', 'What', 'worse', 'message', 'presented', 'such', 'way', 'Can', 'not', 'Be', 'Ignored', 'always', 'plot', 'device', 'have', 'hated', 'not', 'story', 'parents', 'love', 'one', ""'re"", 'members', 'Greenpeace.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'original', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'Jessie', 'James', 'have', 'change', 'heart', 'must', 'side', 'former', 'enemies', 'Ash', 'friends', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'why', 'two', 'have', 'never', 'learned', 'error', 'ways', 'was', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'movie.There', 'also', 'Pikachu', 'cartoon', 'one', 'TV', 'show', 'will', 'enjoy', 'parents', 'will', 'find', 'herd', 'time', 'making', 'sense', 'Pokemon', 'talk', '.Not', 'nearly', 'as', 'highly', 'rated', 'first', 'movie', 'fact', 'only', 'recommended', 'Pokemon', 'fans']",Pokemon: The Movie 2000
528558,A1DG864DFRS9B2,B00003CXLM,Chris Milligan,"[4, 20]","What a pathetic edition to the pantheons of the world's movies. Sure, we have a &quot;movie&quot; cashing in on the unquestionable success of the Pokemon cartoon series, but I wonder just how many people actually stopped to realise the movie was simply an inflated episode of the cartoon? or perhaps even just three episodes strung together? This film... so badly that I'm not even going to give an account of the plot (if I did it would simply be a rambling along the lines of &quot;Charmander casts his fire spell on Some-Other-Irrelevantly-Named-Badly-Drawn-Japanese-Cartoon-Character&quot; and a simple repetition of this kind of thing).The characters are unaddictive (there are way too many of them for starters), the plot trails off in about a thousand direction, the effects are every bit as bad as the cartoon and the language is so simplistic it is hardly going to accelerate children's learning processes (surely something like this designed for children should help them cope with comlpex language skills?).Such a bad addition to the world of movies is this that it is one of the VERY few movies I haven't seen all the way through - I left after 40 mins to watch a real movie (I think it was Jaws). Okay, so its designed for kids. Big wow - so is the very successful, and far more impressive, Toy Story 2, and A Bug's Life, which appeal to all ages without the non-essential obsession with literally scribbled pictures of pointless magical creatures.Avoid this movie at all costs. It is a waste of time, money, effort, attention and everything else, and there is ALWAYS going to be a better kids movie out there. Pixar looks pretty good, and you can never miss with Disney.Oh, and I haven't just slated this movie because I don't like Pokemon, I did it because I genuinely believe it deserves it. The original Pokemon movie is marginally better than this and if you must see Baulbosaur and co. in battle on the big screen go and see Pokemon The First Movie. Alternatively, watch an episode of the cartoon, which is infinitely better and (because it is much shorter) far more tolerable.",1,This movie is a waste of valuable film reel.,984441600,"03 13, 2001",2001,2096,"['What', 'pathetic', 'edition', 'pantheons', 'world', 'movies', 'Sure', 'have', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'cashing', 'unquestionable', 'success', 'Pokemon', 'cartoon', 'series', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'actually', 'stopped', 'realise', 'movie', 'was', 'simply', 'inflated', 'episode', 'cartoon', 'perhaps', 'even', 'just', 'three', 'episodes', 'strung', 'together', 'film', 'so', 'badly', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'give', 'account', 'plot', 'did', 'would', 'simply', 'be', 'rambling', 'lines', 'quot', 'Charmander', 'fire', 'spell', 'Some-Other-Irrelevantly-Named-Badly-Drawn-Japanese-Cartoon-Character', 'quot', 'simple', 'repetition', 'kind', 'thing', '.The', 'characters', 'are', 'unaddictive', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'starters', 'plot', 'thousand', 'direction', 'effects', 'are', 'bit', 'as', 'bad', 'cartoon', 'language', 'so', 'simplistic', 'hardly', 'going', 'accelerate', 'children', 'learning', 'surely', 'something', 'designed', 'children', 'should', 'help', 'cope', 'comlpex', 'language', 'skills', 'bad', 'addition', 'world', 'movies', 'one', 'VERY', 'few', 'movies', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'way', 'left', '40', 'mins', 'watch', 'real', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'Jaws', 'Okay', 'designed', 'kids', 'Big', 'wow', 'so', 'very', 'successful', 'far', 'more', 'impressive', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'appeal', 'ages', 'non-essential', 'obsession', 'literally', 'scribbled', 'pictures', 'pointless', 'magical', 'creatures.Avoid', 'movie', 'costs', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'effort', 'attention', 'everything', 'else', 'ALWAYS', 'going', 'be', 'better', 'kids', 'movie', 'there', 'Pixar', 'pretty', 'good', 'can', 'never', 'miss', 'Disney.Oh', 'have', ""n't"", 'just', 'slated', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Pokemon', 'did', 'genuinely', 'believe', 'original', 'Pokemon', 'movie', 'marginally', 'better', 'must', 'see', 'Baulbosaur', 'co.', 'battle', 'big', 'screen', 'go', 'see', 'Pokemon', 'First', 'Movie', 'Alternatively', 'watch', 'episode', 'cartoon', 'infinitely', 'better', 'much', 'shorter', 'far', 'more', 'tolerable']",Pokemon: The Movie 2000

528561,A3HFRPVOJCMN23,B00003CXLM,D. B. Levenstam,"[37, 40]","Pok&eacute;mon 2000  The Movie:  The Power of OneThis movie starts with a little short called &quot;Pikachu's Rescue Adventure.&quot;  Unlike the short which accompanied Pok&eacute;mon The First Movie, Pikachu's Rescue Adventure contains substance as well as cuteness.  It focuses, as the name suggests, on Pikachu's adventure rescuing--Togepi!  The short treats the viewer to Pikachu's intelligence, bravery, and of course, cuteness.  Like the first short, it goes out of its way to show a wide variety of Pok&eacute;mon, including four new ones, which I understand are named Hoothoot, Ladyba, Bellossom and Elekid.  Elekid, a new electric Pok&eacute;mon, plays a major role after becoming friends with Pikachu through an exchange of electricity.  (Hoothoot and Bellossom now have played important roles in episodes of Pok&eacute;mon: The Johto Journeys on television as well.)  You'll even finally get to see a Snorlax do something other than eat and sleep!The Power of One itself seems substantially less dark than its precursor, yet manages to outdo the First Movie's tale of MewTwo versus Mew.  The Power of One Introduces us to a new Pok&eacute;mon, a powerful Guardian of the Water named Lugia which is nearly as large as the three legendary birds--Moltres, Zapdos and Articuno--combined.  It's also nearly as powerful as the three combined.  I say &quot;nearly&quot; because, according to an ancient prophecy, without the help of the Chosen One all of its efforts to stop the three from fighting will come to nothing, &quot;making the world turn to ash.&quot;  And who should be the Chosen One?  Well, as Misty realizes, the prophecy DOES say that the world will &quot;turn to Ash.&quot;As an added little bonus, the movie finally provides first names for Professors Oak and Ivy, and for Mrs. Ketchum, Ash's mom. It also gives two uproarious, albeit non-speaking cameo appearances by the original companion of Ash and Misty--Brock the Rock.  Fans of Brock, myself included, may find his limited role disappointing.  Fans of Tracey, Brock's replacement, may also be disappointed at his limited role in The Power of One.  Moltres fans might be disappointed that he isn't a good-guy like he was in his one appearance in the TV series, and at the way he's been drawn for the movie.  Misty fans, however, will revel in her pivotal role.Team Rocket fans, perpetually hoping to find their heroes playing a role other than that of the inept butt of jokes, will find their hopes finally realized.  Team Rocket too plays a pivotal role in The Power of One, believe it or not, deliberately and through the creativity of Jesse, James and Meowth!  Ah Team Rocket, we always knew your tendency to &quot;think outside the box&quot; would pay off one day.In addition to Lugia and Team Rocket's effectiveness, the movie offers something else new:  a new Pok&eacute;mon called Slowking.  Slowking, the final evolved form of Slowpoke and Slowbro, resembles a Slowbro, but with the spiral Shellder on its head rather than on its tail.  Best of all, the Slowking can speak.  When you hear what he has to say, you'll be glad he can.  Lugia's no slouch at communication either--like MewTwo, he just psychically speaks in Ash's head.  Neat, huh?The Power of One offers an amazing spectacle of color and animation.  The movie produces vibrant images, color and sound.  I found the music good too, although I must warn you that as with the first movie, most of the songs on the soundtrack appear only over the closing credits and have little to do with the movie itself.  At least more of the songs from the this soundtrack seem at least generally related to Pok&eacute;mon.  You will definitely want to watch the closing credits, however, both to hear &quot;Weird&quot; Al Yankovic's &quot;Polkamon&quot; song and to see the second, hysterically-funny, cameo appearance by Brock.  If you like Pok&eacute;mon you will like this movie; your little Pok&eacute;maniac (either the one you tuck into bed at night or the one hiding inside you) will love it.",5,Five Pikas for An Improvement Over the First Movie!!!!!,974246400,"11 15, 2000",2000,4033,"['Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', '2000', 'Movie', 'Power', 'OneThis', 'movie', 'little', 'short', 'called', 'quot', 'Pikachu', 'Rescue', 'Adventure.', 'quot', 'short', 'accompanied', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'First', 'Movie', 'Pikachu', 'Rescue', 'Adventure', 'substance', 'as', 'well', 'cuteness', 'name', 'Pikachu', 'adventure', 'rescuing', 'Togepi', 'short', 'viewer', 'Pikachu', 'intelligence', 'bravery', 'course', 'cuteness', 'first', 'short', 'way', 'show', 'wide', 'variety', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'including', 'four', 'new', 'ones', 'understand', 'are', 'named', 'Hoothoot', 'Ladyba', 'Bellossom', 'Elekid', 'Elekid', 'new', 'electric', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'major', 'role', 'becoming', 'friends', 'Pikachu', 'exchange', 'electricity', 'Hoothoot', 'Bellossom', 'now', 'have', 'played', 'important', 'roles', 'episodes', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'Johto', 'Journeys', 'television', 'well', ""'ll"", 'even', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'Snorlax', 'do', 'something', 'other', 'eat', 'sleep', 'Power', 'One', 'substantially', 'less', 'dark', 'precursor', 'yet', 'outdo', 'First', 'Movie', 'tale', 'MewTwo', 'versus', 'Mew', 'Power', 'One', 'new', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'powerful', 'Guardian', 'Water', 'named', 'Lugia', 'nearly', 'as', 'large', 'three', 'legendary', 'birds', 'Moltres', 'Zapdos', 'Articuno', 'combined', 'also', 'nearly', 'as', 'powerful', 'three', 'combined', 'say', 'quot', 'nearly', 'quot', 'according', 'ancient', 'prophecy', 'help', 'Chosen', 'One', 'efforts', 'stop', 'three', 'fighting', 'will', 'come', 'nothing', 'quot', 'making', 'world', 'turn', 'ash.', 'quot', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'Chosen', 'One', 'Well', 'Misty', 'prophecy', 'DOES', 'say', 'world', 'will', 'quot', 'turn', 'Ash.', 'quot', 'added', 'little', 'bonus', 'movie', 'finally', 'first', 'names', 'Professors', 'Oak', 'Ivy', 'Mrs.', 'Ketchum', 'Ash', 'mom', 'also', 'two', 'uproarious', 'non-speaking', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'original', 'companion', 'Ash', 'Misty', 'Brock', 'Rock', 'Fans', 'Brock', 'included', 'may', 'find', 'limited', 'role', 'disappointing', 'Fans', 'Tracey', 'Brock', 'replacement', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'disappointed', 'limited', 'role', 'Power', 'One', 'Moltres', 'fans', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', ""n't"", 'good-guy', 'was', 'one', 'appearance', 'TV', 'series', 'way', 'been', 'drawn', 'movie', 'Misty', 'fans', 'however', 'will', 'revel', 'pivotal', 'role.Team', 'Rocket', 'fans', 'perpetually', 'hoping', 'find', 'heroes', 'playing', 'role', 'other', 'inept', 'butt', 'jokes', 'will', 'find', 'hopes', 'finally', 'realized', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'too', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Power', 'One', 'believe', 'not', 'deliberately', 'creativity', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Meowth', 'Ah', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'always', 'knew', 'tendency', 'quot', 'think', 'box', 'quot', 'would', 'pay', 'off', 'one', 'day.In', 'addition', 'Lugia', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'effectiveness', 'movie', 'something', 'else', 'new', 'new', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'called', 'Slowking', 'Slowking', 'final', 'evolved', 'form', 'Slowpoke', 'Slowbro', 'Slowbro', 'spiral', 'Shellder', 'head', 'rather', 'tail', 'Best', 'Slowking', 'can', 'speak', 'When', 'hear', 'what', 'say', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'can', 'Lugia', 'slouch', 'communication', 'MewTwo', 'just', 'psychically', 'Ash', 'head', 'Neat', 'huh', 'Power', 'One', 'amazing', 'spectacle', 'color', 'animation', 'movie', 'vibrant', 'images', 'color', 'sound', 'found', 'music', 'good', 'too', 'must', 'warn', 'first', 'movie', 'most', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'only', 'closing', 'credits', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'movie', 'least', 'more', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'seem', 'least', 'generally', 'related', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'watch', 'closing', 'credits', 'however', 'hear', 'quot', 'Weird', 'quot', 'Al', 'Yankovic', 'quot', 'Polkamon', 'quot', 'song', 'see', 'second', 'hysterically-funny', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Brock', 'like', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'little', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'maniac', 'one', 'tuck', 'bed', 'night', 'one', 'hiding', 'will', 'love']",Pokemon: The Movie 2000

Word  of  warning  this movie  has  some  pretty  intense  fighting  scenes  in  it. Not  as  bad  as  to  the  extend  the  first  movie  was  near  the  end.  Sad  to  say  they  have  been  not  been  properly  rating  kids  film  since  like  1989  when  all  dogs  g  to  heaven  1  came  out.  The  trailors  are  very  misleading  for  all  dogs 1  2  and  the  early  pokemon  movies. Pokemon  3  is  very  violent  as  well. Ash  almost  died  in  charizard  came  very  close  to  possibly  dying.  So  parental  persence  maybe  be  required  for  all  the  films up  til Jirachi  wish  maker.  So I  don't  recommend using IMDB  if  you  want  to  decide  to see  the  movie don't  they  tend  to  be  either  to  harsh  our  not  harsh  enough  usually. I  gave  this  a  five  star  rating  because  amazon  does  not  use  the  ten  star  system I  thought  giving it  a  4  would  be  to  harsh. I'd  give  it  and  8  out  of  ten  the  later  films  I  will  be  harsher  one  because they  made  a  really  dumb  decision  starting  during  pokemon 6  that  made  most  the  films  that  followed  after  word  not  as  enjoyable  but  still  enough  to  get  a  decent  watch. (as  for  why  the  pokemon  1  got  so many  bad  scores stuff  there  that  was  stuf ctu  out  there  was  in  pokemon 1 there  was  and  extend  opening  when  they  explain  that  mew II  was  one  of  5  other  clones  all  of  them  except  him died. Unfortunately  due  to  one  of  the  clones  being  a  little  girl  name amber of  one  of  the scientist  working  for  giovani  of  team  rocket  the  studio  changed  there  mind  and  cut  it  out. out  of  fear  most  like  that alot  of  religious  parents  would  complain  about  it  dimishing  the  films  finacial  success  in  theaters.  There  also  is  a  crude  humor  joke  near  the  end  of  pokemon  2000  the  film  so  parental  guidance  may  be  required  for  kids  under  12. look It has been along time since  ashes last adventure.

Before the film, there is a short titled, ""Pikachu's Rescue Adventure.""  The actual film revolves around three Legendary Pokemon (Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres), and how a Pokemon collector is trying to capture all three of them in order to capture Lugia (the ""Great Guardian"").  Ash ends up being the ""Chosen One"" referenced in a legend, and it's up to him to save the day.This DVD release of Pokemon The Movie 2000 has some special features.  First, there is an extra labeled as, ""Soundtrack Live.""  This includes live performances of Dream Street's ""They Don't Understand,"" Alysha's ""Dreams,"" and Youngstown and Nobody's Angel's version of ""Pokemon World.""  There is also a two-minute documentary about the making of the soundtrack, which includes interviews with Donna Summer and ""Weird Al"" Yankovic.  All of these extras were part of ""The Power of One: The Pokemon 2000 Movie Special"" that aired on The WB.  There are also theatrical trailers for Pokemon The Movie 2000 and for Pokemon The Movie 3.Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this film.

528575,AQGCART9DSM8B,B00003CXLM,"""lugia2010""","[3, 5]","I watched the original Japanese version of this film in March 2000, and was so impressed with how the writers had turned this movie around. It's no secret that Mewtwo Strikes Back was not well received, but to all those who criticised the first movie, this is the producer's way of getting their own back!P2K is a superb film. It has the three basic elements that make a great film: it's interesting for its entire length, it actually as a plot (something that MSB lacked) and it has characters in it that can be related to. The dub, as in MSB, is excellent, and my thanks go out to Michael Haigney and all of the US production team, because they did a really great job with P2K, despite the odd bit such as the now infamous Slowking's &quot;I could use pants&quot; line.The plot line from the original movie was maintained in the US edition, which I was pleased to see. There were no parts omitted this time (RE: The Birth of Mewtwo which was dropped from the US version of MSB, which explained so much about Mewtwo's background), and the characters retained the bulk of their dialog. My only gripe on the character side is the name of the villain - Laurence. When did you last come across a bad guy called Laurence?!On the audio front, an excellent substitute for the original Japanese movie, although I was still not that happy about the choice of music in the movie (despite being much better than the music for MSB). I'd like to see less pop junk next time around. As for the score (BGM), as with MSB, I was really pleased with it. The hauntingly beautiful theme of Lugia and the atmospheric &quot;The Legend Comes To Life&quot; track near the end of the movie are my favourites.So, a successful comeback after MSB.

In the plotline, an evil dastardly guy named Gelardan/Lawrence III (he was called ""Gelardan"" in the closed captioning, but someone said his name was Lawrence III, so I'm not entirely sure what his name actually is) decides to add the legendary birds Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres to his collection of rare items.  He thinks this way he can also collect another legendary Pokemon, Lugia, as well.  Of course, when he succeeds in capturing Moltres, he inadvertantly throws everything horribly out of balance.  (Whether or not he did it on purpose isn't entirely clear...)Around this time, weather patterns are thrown out of whack and Pokemon everywhere are disturbed, so they are travelling to the source of the problem--Shamuti Island in the Orange Archipelago, which is, coincidentally, where Ash, Misty and Tracey currently are located.Eventually, the group meets a girl named Melody and partakes in an annual festival of sorts.  Part of the festival involves an ancient ritual, and Ash is picked to play ""the chosen one"" in said ritual.  Little does he know he really IS the ""chosen one"", according to an ancient text, and he's supposed to save the world from Gelardan/Lawrence III.  Coincidentally, Lawrence III also read the text and misinterpreted it, which is part of why he's attempting to collect the Legendary Birds.  You'll understand once you see it.This movie is really nicely done.  The special effects and facial expressions are of course great, and the voice acting is also nice.  I also especially like the part towards the end where Melody plays Lugia's song in its full glory--they really did a nice job with that.Best of all, you get to see Team Rocket help out the good guys.So in conclusion, this movie is really nice and is definitely worth purchasing, maybe even if you're not a Pokemon fan.This movie is only missing one thing, unfortunately: Mewtwo.  :)There is also a rather interesting mini-movie, ""Pikachu's Rescue Adventure"", wherein Pikachu and company go to rescue Togepi, with the help of an Elekid, and they find a lot of interesting things along the way.

The animation is not first rate by any means, but it really isn't all that bad either.  Believe me, I have seen much worse.I feel that the common misconception about Pokemon is that Pokemon deals with an on-going story, kind of like a &quot;soap-opera&quot; in a sense.  Those who don't follow the series will of course have a much more difficult time in understanding the characters and the overall story than someone who does follow the series.  Star-Trek, The X-Files and other such series are no different in this regard.I feel that Pokemon can bring magic and a very powerful meaning without condoning violence to anyone who is involved about it.

Ash basically has to go find three ancient treasures in order to restore the peace which was disrupted by a greedy Pokemon collector, Lawrence III.The english version(which sadly is the only language track, besides the french track, on this DVD) makes the movie even more unwatchable. 4Kids Entertainment really wanted to mess with the plot this time, making Ash's role 'bigger' by making him 'The Chosen One' just so they could put another message in the movie.To make matters worse, they totalled the soundtrack again, replacing it with their MIDI junk. Luckily, there ARE some music scores in this movie that are good, namely the last scene's.The DVD has a lack of extra features, because the only ones here are some videos of some 'bands' and 'singers', a trailer for the 3rd film, and the short film, which was toyed with just like it's predecessor.

The plot involves a Pokemon collector called Laurence III who wants to capture the three Legendary birds Articuno. Zapdos and Moltres - or the Gods of Ice, Lightning and Fire as they're called here. Unfortunately, this creates a huge problem with Earth's weather patterns, causing violent storms and snow, and it is left up to Ash to get them back, and return things to normal.There are some little hints to the possibility of an Ash/Misty romance in this film - when Ash arrives on the island at the beginning of the movie, a girl called Melody kisses Ash on the cheek which makes Misty really jealous, as well as  some other cute moments.Sadly, in spite of an improved plot I believe that, as before, the choice of music stands out as the film`s downfall and the producers haven`t learnt from the mistakes they made in the first film. Apart from a few exceptions (&quot;The Legend Comes To Life&quot; is a wonderful track), this movie replicates the same pop-styled rubbish used in the First Movie. The remix of the TV theme song (&quot;Pokemon World&quot; performed by Youngstown &amp; Nobody's Angel) is absolutely horrible, with a scratchy beat and synthesized vocals. The campaign to ban vocoders starts here...Next time round, I would like to see a better choice of music which is less pop-orientated, but I`m not holding my breath...Overall though, in spite of the terrible soundtrack, this is a major improvement on the First Movie which I think any Pokemon fan should add to their collection.",4,Much better than the First Movie,987897600,"04 22, 2001",2001,1912,"['Many', 'people', 'criticized', 'quot', 'Mewtwo', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'quot', 'when', 'first', 'Pokemon', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'US', 'comparison', 'excellent', 'Japanese', 'version', 'was', 'mess', 'missing', 'out', 'important', 'things', 'explained', 'characters', 'such', 'Birth', 'Mewtwo', 'had', 'sloppy', 'characterization.However', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'say', 'film', 'generally', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'Pokemon', 'movie', 'plot', 'Pokemon', 'collector', 'called', 'Laurence', 'III', 'who', 'capture', 'three', 'Legendary', 'birds', 'Articuno', 'Zapdos', 'Moltres', 'Gods', 'Ice', 'Lightning', 'Fire', ""'re"", 'called', 'here', 'Unfortunately', 'huge', 'problem', 'Earth', 'weather', 'patterns', 'causing', 'violent', 'storms', 'snow', 'left', 'up', 'Ash', 'get', 'back', 'return', 'things', 'are', 'little', 'hints', 'possibility', 'Ash/Misty', 'romance', 'film', 'when', 'Ash', 'island', 'beginning', 'movie', 'girl', 'called', 'Melody', 'Ash', 'cheek', 'Misty', 'really', 'jealous', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'cute', 'moments.Sadly', 'spite', 'improved', 'plot', 'believe', 'that', 'before', 'choice', 'music', 'out', 'film', 's', 'downfall', 'producers', 'haven', 't', 'learnt', 'mistakes', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'Apart', 'few', 'exceptions', 'quot', 'Legend', 'Comes', 'Life', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'track', 'movie', 'same', 'pop-styled', 'rubbish', 'used', 'First', 'Movie', 'remix', 'TV', 'theme', 'song', 'quot', 'Pokemon', 'World', 'quot', 'performed', 'Youngstown', 'amp', 'Nobody', 'Angel', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'scratchy', 'beat', 'synthesized', 'vocals', 'campaign', 'ban', 'vocoders', 'here', 'Next', 'time', 'round', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'better', 'choice', 'music', 'less', 'pop-orientated', 'm', 'not', 'holding', 'breath', 'Overall', 'spite', 'terrible', 'soundtrack', 'major', 'improvement', 'First', 'Movie', 'think', 'Pokemon', 'fan', 'should', 'add', 'collection']",Pokemon: The Movie 2000

By doing so he plans to lure Lugia out of hiding so he cna capture it as well.  Ash and the gang stumble upon this madman and they try to stop him.  Unfortunatly when they free the legendary Birds they go ballistic and so it is up to Ash and Lugia to stop them.This works because it keeps both parents and kids entertained.  While it does lack the moral dilema that the First movie held, it does hold the attention much beter than the first.  IT's strong point is definetly action but it does hold a strong enough plot that it keeps everyone entertained.",5,An outstanding entry in the Pokemon Series,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,872,"['first', 'Pokemon', 'movie', 'was', 'weak', 'sadly', 'overly', 'cutsey', 'times', 'Pokemon', '2000', 'excellent', 'plot', 'awsome', 'action', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'overall', 'quality', 'entertainment.The', 'plot', 'Pokemon', '2000', 'insane', 'trainer', 'created', 'way', 'capture', 'Legendary', 'Birds', 'Articuno', 'Zapdos', 'Moltres', 'doing', 'so', 'lure', 'Lugia', 'hiding', 'so', 'capture', 'as', 'well', 'Ash', 'gang', 'stumble', 'madman', 'try', 'stop', 'Unfortunatly', 'when', 'free', 'legendary', 'Birds', 'go', 'ballistic', 'Ash', 'Lugia', 'stop', 'them.This', 'parents', 'kids', 'entertained', 'lack', 'moral', 'dilema', 'First', 'movie', 'held', 'hold', 'attention', 'much', 'beter', 'first', 'IT', 'strong', 'point', 'definetly', 'action', 'hold', 'strong', 'enough', 'plot', 'everyone', 'entertained']",Pokemon: The Movie 2000
