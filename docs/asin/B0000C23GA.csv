Perhaps a more perceptive analysis, or something that would explain the mind of the sociopath that is Michael Alig. It is worthy only for the ability to see a group of shallow individuals devoid of empathy. These are a group of ""jumped up nothings"" as the British would say, and it appears that the ones who aren't dead haven't learned much. The most frightening parts of the DVD are the current interviews of a delusional Alig who still envisions himself as somewhat of a star. He laughs, while hystrionically recounting horrific events in his life, and gloats over how many drugs he could consume.  Yet brushes aside the murder of Angel with the pitiful confession that he has ""bad dreams."" Listening to his Baby Jane-esque mother who also wallowed in the club kid scene, might help explain why the bad seed, knew no boundaries. I would have liked to have learned what exactly happened besides the drugs to make Alig devoid of humaness.  But at the end of the documentary all you wonder is why Alig wasn't given the death penalty. Even clean and sober, there seems to be  nothing salvageable about this man. With his degree of narcissism, I have no doubt that he could kill again.

It's strange to say but there is so much posted here, contradictory things, that I just have to agree with.  As a party promoter, Michael Alig probably was the &quot;genius&quot; that many people refer to him as.  However, it does not change what he has become...a murderer, nothing more, nothing less.  With all the success he garnered in such a short period of time, he probably could have created quite a comfortable life for himself.  Instead, drugs took over and look where he ended up..jail!  I guess he can legitimately use this as an excuse for his actions...I mean, take a look at some of the lunatic defense strategies that we have seen.  Does anyone recall the &quot;twinkie defense&quot; in the murder of Harvey Milk?  If Dan White can say twinkies made him do it and have jurors believe it, why not drugs?!  The anser is simple, we are creating a society in which no one is &quot;really&quot; to blame for anything they do!  As an educator, I see it all the time...parents finding excuses for why their children do what they do...and they all have one thing in common...it's not the child's fault.  It's no wonder we have juries believing that the twinkies, or the drugs, were really to blame...their own parents refuse to place blame on their children when they do something wrong.  Michael Alig's mother in this documentary does the same thing.  Personally, I do understand the desire to &quot;protect our own&quot; but if we truly care about people, we will begin teaching them to take responsibility for their actions.  While watching the interview with Michael from prison I was honestly appalled at what I saw and heard.  When he discusses if he's sorry for what he's done, everything he says is steeped in how what he did affected HIS life...he has no feelings about what HE did to Angel and Angel's family...everything is still about Michael and how his life is ruined.In short, our society is creating people like Michael everyday...and we need to change that soon, before it's too late for us.  I think if more people saw this film, they would all come to the same conclusion...it's time to stop blaming everything and everyone else for what we do...and to begin accepting our responsibilty for our own actions...when we do something so horrible, we SHOULD feel badly about it...but for our actions' effect on others, and not what they have done to our lives.  Michael Alig made a choice and Angel is dead....I just wouldn't be able to live with the guilt if I had done something like that.

Watching the Club Kids was so completely riveting and insane.  They didn't make any sense, but it didn't matter. They all become stars, quite simply because they willed it to happen.And then it all went terribly wrong. Surely you know how the story goes: Michael, in an extremely drugged state of mind, killed fellow Club Kid Angel Melendez over drugs.  Angel was bludgeoned and injected with Drano.  His body was left in a bathtub for days, only to be chopped up and placed in a big TV box, stuck in the back of a cab, and then thrown in a river hopefully to sink and never be found.Before the body surfaced,  Michael somewhat jokingly admitted to killing Angel. Wouldn't the best way to claim his innocence be to admit to doing something so horrific and terrible?  Who'd believe that you really did it if you said you did it in such a joking manner?  Someone believed him because Michael's in prison now.""Party Monster"" tells the whole sordid story in detail. It's chock full of Michael Alig interview footage- plus interviews with his mother and lots of the other Club Kids like James St. James and Keoki (among others) .  It's the story of extreme excess, and how it all went horribly wrong.  If you've ever had any desire to experience life through a K-hole, watch this. You'll change your mind immediately!This is the documentary that ultimately spawned James St. James' ""Disco Bloodbath"" book, and the film that came out of that, also called ""Party Monster.""  The book actually fills in the some of the holes that documentary leaves, or at least presents a slightly different viewpoint.  Watch both the documentary AND read James St. James' book to get a fuller picture of what went on.Had the budget been bigger this probably could have been a great film, but directors Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey do a great job with their obviously limited budget.  It's still a very good documentary.It's all rather bittersweet. Michael ultimately got what he wanted: to be a legend. It's probably not the kind of legend that he wanted to be, but it's what he became nonetheless.",4,A Fascinating Train Wreck.,1066003200,"10 13, 2003",2003,2249,"['best', 'friend', 'used', 'skip', 'school', 'knew', 'Michael', 'Alig', 'Club', 'Kids', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'Geraldo', 'Donahue', 'Sally', 'Jessy', 'Raphael', 'other', 'talk', 'show', 'Watching', 'Club', 'Kids', 'was', 'so', 'completely', 'riveting', 'insane', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'become', 'stars', 'quite', 'simply', 'willed', 'happen.And', 'then', 'went', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'Surely', 'know', 'how', 'story', 'Michael', 'extremely', 'drugged', 'state', 'mind', 'killed', 'fellow', 'Club', 'Kid', 'Angel', 'Melendez', 'drugs', 'Angel', 'was', 'bludgeoned', 'injected', 'Drano', 'body', 'was', 'left', 'bathtub', 'days', 'only', 'be', 'chopped', 'up', 'placed', 'big', 'TV', 'box', 'stuck', 'back', 'cab', 'then', 'thrown', 'river', 'hopefully', 'sink', 'never', 'be', 'found.Before', 'body', 'surfaced', 'Michael', 'somewhat', 'jokingly', 'admitted', 'killing', 'Angel', 'Would', ""n't"", 'best', 'way', 'claim', 'innocence', 'be', 'admit', 'doing', 'something', 'so', 'horrific', 'terrible', 'Who', ""'d"", 'believe', 'really', 'did', 'said', 'did', 'joking', 'manner', 'Someone', 'believed', 'Michael', 'prison', 'now', 'Party', 'Monster', 'whole', 'sordid', 'story', 'detail', 'chock', 'full', 'Michael', 'Alig', 'interview', 'footage-', 'interviews', 'mother', 'lots', 'other', 'Club', 'Kids', 'James', 'St.', 'James', 'Keoki', 'others', 'story', 'extreme', 'excess', 'how', 'went', 'horribly', 'wrong', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'desire', 'experience', 'life', 'K-hole', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'change', 'mind', 'immediately', 'documentary', 'ultimately', 'spawned', 'James', 'St.', 'James', 'Disco', 'Bloodbath', 'book', 'film', 'came', 'also', 'called', 'Party', 'Monster', 'book', 'actually', 'holes', 'documentary', 'leaves', 'least', 'presents', 'slightly', 'different', 'viewpoint', 'Watch', 'documentary', 'read', 'James', 'St.', 'James', 'book', 'get', 'fuller', 'picture', 'what', 'went', 'budget', 'been', 'bigger', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'directors', 'Randy', 'Barbato', 'Fenton', 'Bailey', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'obviously', 'limited', 'budget', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'documentary.It', 'rather', 'bittersweet', 'Michael', 'ultimately', 'got', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'legend', 'probably', 'not', 'kind', 'legend', 'wanted', 'be', 'what', 'became', 'nonetheless']",N/A

As I went to college in Michael Alig's hometown of South Bend,IN, and being that I am always interested in how and why people become the way they are, I wanted to see how this seemingly average Hoosier evolved into the fabled Club Kid / toast of New York / killer.  If I were 17 and back in those days I would probably think he was a god leading me and whoever else to the most fantastic way of life imaginable.  But, life can't be a party 24 hours a day, and this is proof positive of it.It is truly horrifying to see how low a human being can go, and it evokes such anger that they choose this for themselves.  Each and every one of the main characters in this glamour world are self destructive, self centered, and desperately crying out for attention.  And sure, we've all done something like this in the past whether it's using drugs, dressing wild, or misbehaving somehow, but unlike Michael Alig, we all grow up.  And guess what?  Being responsible, paying your bills on time, having a job, and DOING something with yourself rather than staying in a constant state of squalid ugliness is COOL!Something that really bothered me at the end of this documentary was the fact that Alig showed no remorse for what he had done, and the others who were indirectly connected to it didn't express much concern either.  Yes, Alig was the only one who committed the crime, but no one said ""How terrible ..."", ""If only ..."", ""Such a tradgedy ..."", etc.  The only one who shed a tear for Angel was his brother.  Everyone's moved on, but there is clearly a part of Alig that clings to the past and a spark of hope that he can reclaim it.

""Well, we'll be arresting him, too.""  I kept thinking of that skit while watching this movie.  Why, I wondered, was it possible for any of the people in this documentary to become famous?  Ultimately Michael Alig had to take responsibility for murdering fellow Club Kid and drug dealer Angel Melendez, but for some unfathomable reason Alig was a celebrity murderer.  My bafflement wasn't merely because neither he nor any of the other people in this film deserved in any way to be famous.  They had not, after all, achieved anything, done anything of importance, made the world a better or more wondrous place, or shown themselves to be in any real way to be interesting people.  Their only apparent talent was for engaging in more and more extreme behavior.  But my concern is not just that none of them deserved any kind of fame; my concern is why our society enabled them to become famous in the first place.Perhaps there are ideas in Debord's THE SOCIETY OF THE SPECTACLE that would explain this.  Perhaps he and his colleagues could explain why people could become famous and notorious simply for being over the top.  It is a baffling form of fame.  There are parallels with Dandyism in the 19th century, but I doubt of these people have heard of Huysmans let alone &Agrave; REBOURS.  The documentary was fascinating if only for presenting an endless string of inconceivably unimpressive bores addicted to surpassing limits.  The idea that kept passing through my brain was how dull they all must be, how empty they all must have felt, to be possessed with the need to surpass all boundaries just to make themselves feel special.  To do these things to make some sort of personal statement seemed tantamount to shouting, ""I have no other statement to make than this!""  Their activities seemed acts of nihilism.In short, this is an interesting movie about some dramatically dull and uninteresting people, who were willing to go to almost any extreme to make themselves envied by people who didn't know any better.  The filmmakers tell the story well and you get a real sense of what transpired.  To their credit they do not make the Party Kids seem interesting or enviable.
