583162,A2NVI7WKXB0G2R,B00005JCDA,"Alain Blouin ""alblouin""","[17, 27]","I haven't bought this dvd. However, I saw it at my local store, and on the back of it's box, it said the dvd lasted about 150 minutes. Seeing it, I just couldn't help comparing with the australian opera dvd's length...And if you take not only the farewell ceremony at the end of the latter, but also all the credits before it, it still leaves *170* minutes. Therefore, from pure logic, I would say either the conductor in this Arthaus dvd production has real fast tempi, or there were made substantial cuts to the score.Also, from the reviews made on this dvd, the catholics in this production are dressed in fascist uniforms. Not only it may be offensive for any christian who buys it, but it also takes out what the public in Meyerbeer's time praised: impartiality. Indeed, peoples in the 19th century praised Meyerbeer for having put protestants and catholics on equal grounds. The two lovers are a catholic and a protestant, and both are good. And to Valentine's father's savagery is opposed Marcel's slightly pedant and hateful attitude toward catholics, and Valentine's husband's indignation toward the plans of massacring the huguenots. However, approaching the story of Batholomew's day massacre to the persecutions the jews suffered during the second world war is, I think, of very bad taste, and may miss the composer's point.To that is added the fact that the opera is sung here in german instead of french, and without french subtitles...In front of all that, question yourselves just how important superior quality singing is to you before choosing between both versions of the opera...If, for you, opera's all about voice, get this dvd. But if you think the composer's view of the subject he puts into music is important, and that what's important is before all the artistic value as a whole, the australian opera's dvd, despite its slightly imperfect cast, has many more merits from this point of view.",3,Just a warning,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,1917,"['have', ""n't"", 'bought', 'dvd', 'However', 'saw', 'local', 'store', 'back', 'box', 'said', 'dvd', 'lasted', '150', 'minutes', 'Seeing', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'comparing', 'australian', 'opera', 'dvd', 'length', 'take', 'not', 'only', 'farewell', 'ceremony', 'end', 'latter', 'also', 'credits', 'still', '*170*', 'minutes', 'Therefore', 'pure', 'logic', 'would', 'say', 'conductor', 'Arthaus', 'dvd', 'production', 'real', 'fast', 'tempi', 'were', 'made', 'substantial', 'cuts', 'score.Also', 'reviews', 'made', 'dvd', 'catholics', 'production', 'are', 'dressed', 'fascist', 'uniforms', 'Not', 'only', 'may', 'be', 'offensive', 'christian', 'who', 'also', 'out', 'what', 'public', 'Meyerbeer', 'time', 'praised', 'impartiality', 'Indeed', 'peoples', '19th', 'century', 'praised', 'Meyerbeer', 'having', 'put', 'protestants', 'catholics', 'equal', 'grounds', 'two', 'lovers', 'are', 'catholic', 'protestant', 'are', 'good', 'Valentine', 'father', 'savagery', 'opposed', 'Marcel', 'slightly', 'pedant', 'hateful', 'attitude', 'catholics', 'Valentine', 'husband', 'indignation', 'plans', 'massacring', 'huguenots', 'However', 'approaching', 'story', 'Batholomew', 'day', 'massacre', 'persecutions', 'jews', 'suffered', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'think', 'very', 'bad', 'taste', 'may', 'miss', 'composer', 'point.To', 'added', 'fact', 'opera', 'sung', 'here', 'german', 'instead', 'french', 'french', 'subtitles', 'front', 'question', 'yourselves', 'just', 'how', 'important', 'superior', 'quality', 'singing', 'choosing', 'versions', 'opera', 'voice', 'get', 'dvd', 'think', 'composer', 'view', 'subject', 'music', 'important', 'what', 'important', 'artistic', 'value', 'whole', 'australian', 'opera', 'dvd', 'slightly', 'imperfect', 'cast', 'many', 'more', 'merits', 'point', 'view']",N/A
583163,A12CWQK040OWRY,B00005JCDA,"Ben Franklin ""bf""","[5, 12]","Despite the mediocre quality of most of the music in the opera, I was mesmerized.  Here we have a story of two religious faiths, each deciding they are the true one and that God tells them that the other should die.  Maybe it could be staged where the two were Sunni and Shia instead of Catholic and Protestant.  The emotions and lack of logic are essentially the same.  The musical highlight, for me, was the Verdian encounter between Raoul (Richard Leech) and Valentine (Lucy Peacock) in the fourth act.  But overall it was a strong performance with excellent sound and video.",4,"Very, very relevant",1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,578,"['mediocre', 'quality', 'most', 'music', 'opera', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'Here', 'have', 'story', 'two', 'religious', 'faiths', 'deciding', 'are', 'true', 'one', 'God', 'other', 'should', 'die', 'Maybe', 'could', 'be', 'staged', 'where', 'two', 'were', 'Sunni', 'Shia', 'instead', 'Catholic', 'Protestant', 'emotions', 'lack', 'logic', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'musical', 'highlight', 'was', 'Verdian', 'encounter', 'Raoul', 'Richard', 'Leech', 'Valentine', 'Lucy', 'Peacock', 'fourth', 'act', 'overall', 'was', 'strong', 'performance', 'excellent', 'sound', 'video']",N/A
583164,AKGVGV7EPQE5I,B00005JCDA,"Janos Gardonyi ""jgarch2002""","[19, 19]","Les Huguenots, transported into divided Berlin, given by DeutscheOper rejuvenates the now almost unfairly forgotten opera. This production is very original, emotionally involving and with a tremendous shock value about thecruelty and barbarism of men. In contrast, some parts are rather lighthearted and comic (eg. the bathing scene, or the duet between Raoul and theQueen) which makes the progress of the work even more disturbingand tragic. The Hungarian born Soltesz has an authoritative grip,a thorough knowledge of the score an keeps the opera movinglike a steam roller. The fourth and fifth acts will blow you away! The singers are very competent. They were selected for looks and acting ability as well as voice. Angela Denning has comic talent and makes her aria come off very well.Lucy Peacock, the tragic heroine, is unforgettable.The American tenor Richard Leech, who established his reputation in this role as Raoul, sings and acts marvelously in spite of the tremendous demands of the role.To sum up: Great theater, very memorable and enjoyable. Highly recommended!Having said all that and after watching the Australian DVD which is to all intents and purposes complete, I must say that this production is severely cut.The main problem is leaving out most of the 3rd act where a great deal of action takes place and without it we lose the dramatic continuity. The 3rd act also contains a wonderful ballet, one of Meyerbeer's specialties. Even so, I'll still prefer the German production for the reasons mentioned earlier.",5,"An inspired, highly imaginative, reincarnated Meyerbeer .",1053561600,"05 22, 2003",2003,1534,"['Les', 'Huguenots', 'transported', 'divided', 'Berlin', 'given', 'DeutscheOper', 'now', 'almost', 'unfairly', 'forgotten', 'opera', 'production', 'very', 'original', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'tremendous', 'shock', 'value', 'thecruelty', 'barbarism', 'men', 'contrast', 'parts', 'are', 'rather', 'lighthearted', 'comic', 'eg', 'bathing', 'scene', 'duet', 'Raoul', 'theQueen', 'progress', 'work', 'even', 'more', 'disturbingand', 'tragic', 'Hungarian', 'born', 'Soltesz', 'authoritative', 'grip', 'thorough', 'knowledge', 'score', 'opera', 'steam', 'roller', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'acts', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'singers', 'are', 'very', 'competent', 'were', 'selected', 'looks', 'acting', 'ability', 'as', 'well', 'voice', 'Angela', 'Denning', 'comic', 'talent', 'aria', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'well.Lucy', 'Peacock', 'tragic', 'heroine', 'unforgettable.The', 'American', 'tenor', 'Richard', 'Leech', 'who', 'established', 'reputation', 'role', 'Raoul', 'sings', 'marvelously', 'spite', 'tremendous', 'demands', 'role.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Great', 'theater', 'very', 'memorable', 'enjoyable', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Having', 'said', 'watching', 'Australian', 'DVD', 'intents', 'purposes', 'complete', 'must', 'say', 'production', 'severely', 'cut.The', 'main', 'problem', 'leaving', 'out', 'most', '3rd', 'act', 'where', 'great', 'deal', 'action', 'place', 'lose', 'dramatic', 'continuity', '3rd', 'act', 'also', 'wonderful', 'ballet', 'one', 'Meyerbeer', 'specialties', 'Even', 'so', ""'ll"", 'still', 'prefer', 'German', 'production', 'reasons', 'mentioned', 'earlier']",N/A

Leech sounds good as ever.  Denning is not Sutherland, but is ok and makes her role a bit comic.  This opera needs a few light touches as this ends in massacre.  Peacock sings ok but is more of an actress.Maybe one has to be German to understand the staging.  Its certainly different.
