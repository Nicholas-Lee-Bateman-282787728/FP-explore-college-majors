I'm amazed they managed to figure out how to feed themselves. Coarse, vile, vulgar, cowardly, drunken, addicted, narcissistic, infantile, but let me tell you how I really feel. Watching these imbeciles wallow in self pity and anger over petty deeds from the distant past is torturous. One hopes this is not a reflection of the average because it would propel any virtuous individual out of the country in a nanosecond. These morons don't seem to have a clue about simple concepts like chivalry, courtesy, honor, modesty, truthfulness, or any other virtue. They are clearly a product of the absurd &#34;self esteem&#34; movement popularized by trust fund babies, where concluding a stint in rehab is considered an achievement.What a bunch of useless idiots.",2,Imbeciles on parade,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,880,"['WoW', 'relentlessly', 'depressing', 'portrait', 'so', 'called', 'American', 'family', 'member', 'more', 'basket', 'case', 'next', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'managed', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'feed', 'Coarse', 'vile', 'vulgar', 'cowardly', 'drunken', 'addicted', 'narcissistic', 'infantile', 'let', 'tell', 'how', 'really', 'feel', 'Watching', 'imbeciles', 'wallow', 'self', 'pity', 'anger', 'petty', 'deeds', 'distant', 'past', 'torturous', 'One', 'not', 'reflection', 'average', 'would', 'propel', 'virtuous', 'individual', 'country', 'nanosecond', 'morons', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'clue', 'simple', 'concepts', 'chivalry', 'courtesy', 'honor', 'modesty', 'truthfulness', 'other', 'virtue', 'are', 'clearly', 'product', 'absurd', '34', 'esteem', '34', 'movement', 'popularized', 'trust', 'fund', 'babies', 'where', 'concluding', 'stint', 'rehab', 'considered', 'bunch', 'useless', 'idiots']",Another Happy Day

1504839,A3UR9M6DLAXTU7,B005WTG6MK,Colby,"[1, 1]","I don't know why I like this film so much. A family gathers and argues. The arguing escalates. Ellen Barkin breaks down (her performance will rip your heart out) and her family shows its teeth. The ultimate dysfunctional family, with countless problems.And yet, who is it that sticks by her in the film's final scenes? Her children. Who, as it turns out, have given her the most stress throughout the entire film.In this odd way the film is strangely touching. And not only in the ending...in what is perhaps the film's most beautiful moment, Ellen Barkin walks outside, weeping uncontrollably, and collapses by a tree. Her conflicted son enters the frame, sits down in the grass, and the two weary souls embrace.Talk about emotional cinema.THAT'S it! The reason why I like this film so much: its overflowing with emotion. Be it good or bad (and usually both within one scene) each character demonstrates a wide range of emotion. Ellen Barkin especially.She owns this film. It is very much HER story, even though many other characters are given plenty of screen-time. The actions and side stories of others directly affect her. In many ways she is the glue holding the family together. The only problem is...she dried up before the film even begins.Melodrama. Good, old-fashioned human interaction. Very entertaining here.I was surprised by this film. Its ended up being one of my favorites. Movie: 5/5 stars.The DVD has good video, considering its not blu-ray. Currently this film isn't available on blu-ray in the US. The video quality is average for a newer DVD release. Video: 4/5 stars.The audio is a hit and miss. The film's music is extremely moving, often times acting as the nail in the coffin during many emotional scenes, and is presented well on the DVD. The dialogue can be heard okay, but in a few quieter scenes they could have spoke a little louder. When they're screaming at each other, its great. Audio: 4/5 stars.Overall: 5/5 stars. Not exactly a ""feel-good"" movie, although I find many scenes to be oddly touching. I recommend it to fans of ""different"" films, as well as fans of any of the actors in the film, they all do exceptional work.Rating: Rated R. Strong language throughout the film. Verbal bullying takes place, which may make some viewers uncomfortable. Some of the characters display signs of extreme emotional stress, this will make many viewers feel drained. This is an adult film. Some brief graphic nudity in one scene. Some characters use drugs dangerously, this might disturb some viewers.

1504840,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B005WTG6MK,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Dysfunctional families have long been the fodder for film makers. Like any type of movie they achieve varying degrees of success. This, for my dollar, is one of the better ones.Here's the scoop. Ellen Barkin is headed to Annapolis, MD., with her two boys, to attend the wedding of her oldest son who has been living with her divorced husband. Her oldest daughter will meet her there and it will be a dicey situation to say the least. Being that some of these folks haven't seen each other in years, they're not quite certain what to expect or how to act.I am almost always in awe of these kinds of movies because plot takes a back seat to character and they seem so impossible to write. Writer/director Sam Levinson has done a good job here. There are a lot of characters to keep track of and a very fluid dynamic. Being that he's had only one previous writing credit and only 4 acting credits, it's something that the producers would give him, not only a green light on this, but an awesome cast to work with.These are some screwed up people. Barkin is divorced and she's raised three of her four kids. Two of the three are really screwed up and the third was told he was autistic but he seems normal. The oldest son, who was raised by dad, and whose wedding they're attending seems completely normal, so the finger is pointing at Barkin as being the 'Typhoid Mary' of dysfunction. She's pretty far gone herself and seems to always put herself at the center of the conversation and butt heads with everyone else there. Her older son, Elliot, is very bright and a real character,but is regularly in and out of rehab. The daughter cuts herself and is studying child psychology. Not a fun bunch.Some like this film more than others. I, myself, have questions. Barkin's ex, at one point in their marriage, punched her in the face. He doesn't seem a bad guy, so what happened? Did she goad him into it? Had he finally had it up to his throat with her? His new wife (Demi Moore) has had no problem with him. They allude to Barkin's wealth. The significance of this escapes me. There are other things but, for me, the good here far outweighs the bad.If these kinds of films float your boat this should do you just fine.",4,Lends New Meaning to the Word Dysfunction,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,2213,"['Dysfunctional', 'families', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'fodder', 'film', 'makers', 'type', 'movie', 'achieve', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'dollar', 'one', 'better', 'scoop', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'headed', 'Annapolis', 'MD.', 'two', 'boys', 'attend', 'wedding', 'oldest', 'son', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'divorced', 'husband', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'will', 'meet', 'will', 'be', 'dicey', 'situation', 'say', 'least', 'Being', 'folks', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'years', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'certain', 'what', 'expect', 'how', 'act.I', 'am', 'almost', 'always', 'awe', 'kinds', 'movies', 'plot', 'back', 'seat', 'character', 'seem', 'so', 'impossible', 'write', 'Writer/director', 'Sam', 'Levinson', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'are', 'lot', 'characters', 'keep', 'track', 'very', 'fluid', 'dynamic', 'Being', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'previous', 'writing', 'credit', 'only', '4', 'acting', 'credits', 'something', 'producers', 'would', 'give', 'not', 'only', 'green', 'light', 'awesome', 'cast', 'work', 'with.These', 'are', 'screwed', 'up', 'people', 'Barkin', 'divorced', 'raised', 'three', 'four', 'kids', 'Two', 'three', 'are', 'really', 'screwed', 'up', 'third', 'was', 'told', 'was', 'autistic', 'normal', 'oldest', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'dad', 'wedding', ""'re"", 'attending', 'completely', 'normal', 'finger', 'pointing', 'Barkin', 'being', ""'Typhoid"", 'Mary', 'dysfunction', 'pretty', 'far', 'gone', 'always', 'put', 'center', 'conversation', 'butt', 'heads', 'everyone', 'else', 'there', 'older', 'son', 'Elliot', 'very', 'bright', 'real', 'character', 'regularly', 'rehab', 'daughter', 'cuts', 'studying', 'child', 'psychology', 'Not', 'fun', 'bunch.Some', 'film', 'more', 'others', 'have', 'questions', 'Barkin', 'ex', 'one', 'point', 'marriage', 'punched', 'face', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bad', 'guy', 'what', 'happened', 'Did', 'goad', 'Had', 'finally', 'had', 'up', 'throat', 'new', 'wife', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'had', 'problem', 'allude', 'Barkin', 'wealth', 'significance', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'good', 'here', 'far', 'bad.If', 'kinds', 'films', 'float', 'boat', 'should', 'do', 'just', 'fine']",Another Happy Day

No subtitles for hearing impaired.  (2.) No special features except this movie's trailer. If you're already watching the movie why do you need a trailer?  (3.) Excessive number of chiefs telling the few workers what direction the film should have. In this case we have 32 producers which is four times the number of speaking actors. And, 31 more than the number of locations. (4.) 120+ special thanks which is an alternative form of cheap product placement.Romance novel premise written for the targeted white middle class female audience except, instead of romance, we are exclusively shown just the extreme dark side of humans. Forget the idea of complexity in human nature - just keep it cartoonishly simplistic.

An unflinching, dialogue driven story of a family during a very short time without previous character building.  It's really not necessary to know these people anymore than you are shown, only to see the dysfunction of the direct and indirect families.  This is not a feel good movie as the title facetiously implies - 'Another Happy Day'. We meet Lynn (Ellen Barkin), the mother of two sons who remain living at home with her.  The eldest, Eliot (Ezra Miller is a standout), is in-and-out of rehab and full of his own personal demons.  The youngest son, Ben, says about himself that he has ""a bit of Asperger's"" (Syndrome).Lynn is agitated and hurriedly driving to get to the event. Ben is videotaping her while she's being sarcastically interviewed about her family issues by Eliot.  In Eliot's usual caustic manner, he acerbically questions Lynn to the point of explosion, causing Lynn to shout at Ben to ""shut off the f*ing camera"".  This gives an ominous  introduction to what they are heading into; a maelstrom of familial Discord.  Dylan, Lynn's son from her previous marriage to Paul (Thomas Haden-Church), is getting married at the family estate.  Living in the home  is her mother, Doris (Ellen Burstyn), and father, Joe (George Kennedy).  Joe is in very poor physical health while Doris is blatantly cold and insensitive to her own children; Lynn and her two sisters. Of these four women in the family dynamic, Lynn seems to be the only one with any feelings and they are understandably damaged.  Her two sisters remain gossipy and emotionally vacant throughout the weekend; backbiting and obnoxious.  They all offer neither support for Lynn nor any advice in dark times such as these.Paul has re-married Patty (Demi Moore), who is completely selfish and vengeful toward others although did help to raise Dylan.  Paul and Lynn's fragile daughter, Alice (Kate Bosworth), is also coming to her brother's wedding. I wanted to protect her from her own family as she is extremely vulnerable. While their son Dylan is highly favored by Paul, in contrast, Alice has been neglected by her father and is very self-destructive because of these issues.  Lynn is defensive of her daughter during the weekend while Alice apprehensively tries to get to know people in the family better.  Her father wants to get to know her more as he now realizes how his abstinence has affected her, it's all too little and definitely too late.  Alice is so weakened that she cannot attach to her father any longer and has many problems with relating in general.Throughout the weekend the teenage cousins remain unsupervised and deceptively do whatever they have a mind to, especially Eliot.  Lynn tries always to gain control of her children, stay aware of her dubious family, and remain available for a socially inhibited Alice.  This pushes her to the point of emotional exhaustion several times.  Having to go through the never-ending arguments with Paul and Patty's jealous rages, that reach the extreme of literally being choked by her, Lynn is constantly anxious.  She keeps up her tough facade, although her emotions undermine her every time.  Her problem (If you would call it such) is that she is able to feel within a family that has no consideration for others, empathy, or sympathy.The ending lingers with you.  It is an exhausting view as it is pulling your emotions in all directions, an extremely harsh reality for some families ...",5,"""Nothing To Be Sure Of But The Rain..."" - Nina Simone",1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,3694,"['Sam', 'Levinson', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Official', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Winner', 'movie', 'co-produced', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'hauntingly', 'moody', 'soundtrack', 'Olafur', 'Arnalds', 'lending', 'character', 'already', 'over-crowded', 'weekend', 'wedding', 'Annapolis', 'unflinching', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'story', 'family', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'previous', 'character', 'building', 'really', 'not', 'necessary', 'know', 'people', 'anymore', 'are', 'shown', 'only', 'see', 'dysfunction', 'direct', 'indirect', 'families', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'title', 'facetiously', 'Happy', 'Day', 'meet', 'Lynn', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'mother', 'two', 'sons', 'who', 'remain', 'living', 'home', 'eldest', 'Eliot', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'standout', 'in-and-out', 'rehab', 'full', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'youngest', 'son', 'Ben', 'bit', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', '.Lynn', 'agitated', 'hurriedly', 'driving', 'get', 'event', 'Ben', 'videotaping', 'being', 'sarcastically', 'interviewed', 'family', 'issues', 'Eliot', 'Eliot', 'usual', 'caustic', 'manner', 'acerbically', 'questions', 'Lynn', 'point', 'explosion', 'causing', 'Lynn', 'shout', 'Ben', 'shut', 'off', 'f*ing', 'camera', 'ominous', 'introduction', 'what', 'are', 'heading', 'maelstrom', 'familial', 'Discord', 'Dylan', 'Lynn', 'son', 'previous', 'marriage', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Haden-Church', 'getting', 'married', 'family', 'estate', 'Living', 'home', 'mother', 'Doris', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'father', 'Joe', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'Joe', 'very', 'poor', 'physical', 'health', 'Doris', 'blatantly', 'cold', 'insensitive', 'own', 'children', 'Lynn', 'two', 'sisters', 'four', 'women', 'family', 'dynamic', 'Lynn', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'feelings', 'are', 'understandably', 'damaged', 'two', 'sisters', 'remain', 'gossipy', 'emotionally', 'vacant', 'weekend', 'backbiting', 'obnoxious', 'offer', 'neither', 'support', 'Lynn', 'advice', 'dark', 'times', 'such', 'these.Paul', 're-married', 'Patty', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'who', 'completely', 'selfish', 'vengeful', 'others', 'did', 'help', 'raise', 'Dylan', 'Paul', 'Lynn', 'fragile', 'daughter', 'Alice', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'also', 'coming', 'brother', 'wedding', 'wanted', 'protect', 'own', 'family', 'extremely', 'vulnerable', 'son', 'Dylan', 'highly', 'favored', 'Paul', 'contrast', 'Alice', 'been', 'neglected', 'father', 'very', 'self-destructive', 'issues', 'Lynn', 'defensive', 'daughter', 'weekend', 'Alice', 'apprehensively', 'get', 'know', 'people', 'family', 'better', 'father', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'now', 'how', 'abstinence', 'affected', 'too', 'little', 'definitely', 'too', 'late', 'Alice', 'so', 'weakened', 'can', 'not', 'attach', 'father', 'longer', 'many', 'problems', 'relating', 'general.Throughout', 'weekend', 'teenage', 'remain', 'unsupervised', 'deceptively', 'do', 'whatever', 'have', 'mind', 'especially', 'Eliot', 'Lynn', 'always', 'gain', 'control', 'children', 'stay', 'aware', 'dubious', 'family', 'remain', 'available', 'socially', 'inhibited', 'Alice', 'point', 'emotional', 'exhaustion', 'several', 'times', 'Having', 'go', 'never-ending', 'arguments', 'Paul', 'Patty', 'jealous', 'rages', 'reach', 'extreme', 'literally', 'being', 'choked', 'Lynn', 'constantly', 'anxious', 'up', 'tough', 'facade', 'emotions', 'undermine', 'time', 'problem', 'would', 'call', 'such', 'able', 'feel', 'family', 'consideration', 'others', 'empathy', 'sympathy.The', 'ending', 'lingers', 'exhausting', 'view', 'pulling', 'emotions', 'directions', 'extremely', 'harsh', 'reality', 'families']",Another Happy Day

Demi Moore does a good job as the very  histrionic and controlling stepmother; Thomas Hayden Church plays himself, essentially, as the estranged father trying to reconnect with his adult daughter.  The son, Elliott, played by a newcomer, is superb as an addicted adolescent whose mother covers over his drug problem with psychobabble and her own emotional issues. Ellen Barkin's overdramatization wears thin by the end of the movie.  Tears are shed, regrets are dwelled upon, old wounds clawed open, rivalries explored, etc etc.  It was a little too close to real life for my taste and its hard to imagine the audience this would appeal to.  There isn't a narrative arc in this film. No one changes, there is no central conflict, and basically not a lot happens.

Ellen Barkin stars as Lynn (called Ellen at the wedding reception-oops!) whose life is one tragic soap opera after another. She has raised dysfunctional children and she tries to blame everything but herself. While it is pointed out she is a common denominator by her son Ben (Daniel Yelsky), it is not a definite conclusion. Her middle cynical son Elliot (Ezra Miller) has his own issue and finds comfort in drugs. He provides us with one of life's odd philosophies one morning at breakfast and perhaps has some of the best lines in the film, if you are paying attention.The family travels to Maryland for the wedding of her eldest son, one that was raised by her abusive first husband Paul (Thomas Haden Church) and his combative catty wife Patty (Demi Moore). The dysfunctional family spends time at the grandparents and they must endure a rehash of the embarrassing past...as is typical at family get togethers. Grandpa has a bad heart and also likes to wander.The film builds up for the dramatic meet-up of Paul and his estranged daughter Alice (Kate Bosworth)which by this time is anti-climatic. The acting was stellar as one might expect from this cast. The film slows up enough to let you catch your breath, and digest what has happened before the next family crisis.Excessive F-bomb, sexual references, male nudity",5,WE'RE ALL OUT OF LIFE,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,1418,"['film', 'lines', 'dark', 'comedy', 'intense', 'family', 'drama', 'tragedy', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'Lynn', 'called', 'Ellen', 'wedding', 'reception-oops', 'life', 'one', 'tragic', 'soap', 'opera', 'raised', 'dysfunctional', 'children', 'blame', 'everything', 'pointed', 'common', 'denominator', 'son', 'Ben', 'Daniel', 'Yelsky', 'not', 'definite', 'conclusion', 'middle', 'cynical', 'son', 'Elliot', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'own', 'issue', 'comfort', 'drugs', 'one', 'life', 'odd', 'philosophies', 'one', 'morning', 'breakfast', 'perhaps', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'are', 'paying', 'attention.The', 'family', 'travels', 'Maryland', 'wedding', 'eldest', 'son', 'one', 'was', 'raised', 'abusive', 'first', 'husband', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'combative', 'catty', 'wife', 'Patty', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'time', 'grandparents', 'must', 'endure', 'rehash', 'embarrassing', 'past', 'typical', 'family', 'get', 'togethers', 'Grandpa', 'bad', 'heart', 'also', 'wander.The', 'film', 'up', 'dramatic', 'meet-up', 'Paul', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Alice', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'time', 'anti-climatic', 'acting', 'was', 'stellar', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'cast', 'film', 'up', 'enough', 'let', 'catch', 'breath', 'digest', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'family', 'crisis.Excessive', 'F-bomb', 'sexual', 'references', 'male', 'nudity']",Another Happy Day

When they arrive tensions begin to mount as Lynn's son, her mother, her father, and her ex husband and his new wife all try to coexist for a weekend. This is a hard movie to review as well as watch. The movie itself is not that exciting and if it was not for the amazing cast I would have shut it off. This is a movie that reminded me a little of ""Rachel Getting Married"" in the way that it revolves around a dysfunctional family at the time of a normally happy occasion. The problems ultimately overshadow the wedding and the spiral continues until the ending that feels like a slap to the face after watching the struggling family. The title is very ironic.

1504854,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005WTG6MK,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Another Happy Day"" is yet another dysfunctional family-themed drama written and directed by Sam Levinson (his directional debut). The film stars Ellen Barkin (who also produced) as Lynn Hellman, who is going to attend the wedding of Dylan (Michael Nardelli), her beloved son with her ex-husband Paul (Thomas Haden Church). Lynn does not like the idea of meeting Paul and his new wife Patty (Demi Moore) as her first marriage ended in a very acrimonious divorce. And Lynn's two sons Elliot (Ezra Miller) and Ben (Daniel Yelsky) are not very helpful.The film offers some darkly funny moments, but it does not give us a single reason why we should be staying with these mostly annoying characters for nearly two hours. Of course, in comedies or serious dramas, you are often fascinated with these ""annoying people"" and the ways they behave, especially when they offer something funny or insightful, which we could hardly find in ""Another Happy Day.""For Sam Levinson, who should have handled each scene more carefully as director, tries so hard to show how messed-up these people are, that there is little room left for empathy. Though the actors all did a fine job, the character they play repeat the same things over and over again, except a few moments where these talented actors are allowed to show what they can do, like Ellen Barkin's Lynn, who finds herself unable to speak when asked to make a speech.This is where ""Another Happy Day"" is most impressive. Equally impressive is Kate Bosworth as Alice, very vulnerable and sensitive, whose role is, brief as her screen time is, most convincing. With the characters emoting to each other and the film's heavy-handed attempt at satire, ""Another Happy Day"" goes on too long.
