800796,AWC0R3LBKOEU9,B0001DCXTW,Grace,"[5, 6]",We use several Yoga kids DVDs.  My favorite thing about this one is that it encourages them to think about their feelings and how they deal with them.  It helps children visualize what they are feeling and how to act on those feelings.  I recommend it highly! :),5,Love it!,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,262,"['use', 'several', 'Yoga', 'kids', 'DVDs', 'favorite', 'thing', 'one', 'think', 'feelings', 'how', 'deal', 'children', 'visualize', 'what', 'are', 'feeling', 'how', 'act', 'feelings', 'recommend', 'highly']","YogaKids, Vol. 3: Silly to Calm"

Unlike another reviewers 2.5 year old, mine has yet to  be able to follow much of it but it gets him excited to try. I like that they show kids of all ages following the instructor in the way that they are capable. The director shows great understanding in how to get kids involved.",5,Fun and Creative,1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,396,"['first', 'borrowed', 'local', 'library', 'then', 'decided', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'buy', 'indoor', 'winter', 'activity', 'reviewers', '2.5', 'year', 'old', 'mine', 'yet', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'much', 'excited', 'try', 'like', 'show', 'kids', 'ages', 'following', 'instructor', 'way', 'are', 'capable', 'director', 'great', 'understanding', 'how', 'get', 'kids', 'involved']","YogaKids, Vol. 3: Silly to Calm"

My son is VERY high energy and since it's Fall and soon will be Winter I wanted to find exercises to do with him indoors so he won't be bouncing off the walls. This video is EXCELLENT! At first he didn't get it but after I showed him how to do the moves he loved it! He actually picked this DVD over his Brainy Baby and Baby Einstein videos! The lady's voice is very calm and reassuring and the dvd is informative wich I enjoy and my son does as well (learning about nature, our bodies, some words in sanscript etc). Most importantly the video actually WORKS. We did it an hour ago as a matter of fact. My son was bouncing around and acting silly towards the beginning of the video but towards the end he was actually calm and still is an hour later.
