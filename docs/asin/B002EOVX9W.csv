My favorite episode is when Moss (the nerdy guy) has software that teaches him some basic football expressions in a cockney accent so he can fit in and he and Roy try their luck making new friends in a pub.

1265436,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B002EOVX9W,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Here's a bit of reassurance: ""The IT Crowd"" has been staggeringly funny for two seasons already, and ""The IT Crowd: The Complete Third Season"" does not disappoint. The technonerds are still clueless, Jen's love life is still a wasteland, and Douglas finds ever more creative ways to run his company into the ground -- and oh yes, the Internet is destroyed.Jen is horrified when Roy identifies a builder working on her home as a ""Builder From Hell"" who has a penchant for urinating in sinks; at the same time, Douglas uncovers an old revolver in his desk. Guess how  well THAT goes. Then Moss and Roy pretend to be ""proper men,"" hanging out in pubs with soccer fans... but when the ""proper men"" turn out to have some criminal plans, Roy ends up sandwiched in the middle.Additionally, when Jen steps out for a brief job interview at another company, the IT department starts to fall apart -- Moss gets concussed (""Jen, can I call you back? I've just got Jen on the other line""), and Roy is ejected from the building after his jacket is stolen. And when Jen is selected as employee of the month, the boys decide to play a prank on her.When the IT trio sign up for the networking sight Friendface, they find themselves reconnecting with some old friends and exes -- and Jen ends up dragging Moss to her school reunion as her fake husband, while Roy goes on a date with the Joker. Finally, Roy is enlisted to photograph a nude calendar to raise money for ""bosseyedness"" -- but after Jen convinces the women that it's sexist, he finds himself having to photograph some less attractive subjects.Electric sex pants, nude calendars, screaming Japanese businessmen, near-death experiences (""That looked like Hitler!""), girls who look like the Joker, misfiring guns, and the Elders of the Internet. ""The IT Crowd: The Complete Second Season"" piles the increasingly bizarre problems on our already overburdened, underappreciated IT personnel. And while it's a bit more sitcommy than the season before it, there's a sly satirical edge to the comedy.It still has plenty of brilliant writing, riddled with surreal situations (the electric sex pants!) and weird dialogue (""Revenge, that would be uppermost upon my mind! I'm going to wee on everything! I'm going to strain my personal potatoes throughout her premises!""). And while the IT department's social awkwardness is still the main theme, their problems have become even stranger with time (Roy ends up homeless on the streets, holding a cardboard sign that says ""I want to get back to work"").The three main actors are still utterly brilliant -- Katherine Parkinson's Jen keeps falling afoul of her own technological ignorance (""How do you record? ROY?""), Richard Ayoade's twitchy Moss remains socially inept and twitchy (but has some shining prank moments), and Chris O'Dowd's Roy has to deal with The Joker, a gang of thieves, and the horrifying prospect of having to photograph naked old ladies (""... and the last one... has a gangrenous arm. But she still wants to do it!"").Matt Berry also has a bigger role as the hyperdramatic, deeply oblivious Douglas -- he has a gun mishap, deals with the aftermath of Jen's sexual harassment suit, and has a torrid affair with a very unusual woman. Too bad Noel Fielding is absent from this season.It's not QUITE as surreal and goofy as the second season, but ""The IT Crowd: The Complete Third Season"" is a staggeringly funny, slyly clever little show. I'm 99% sure you'll enjoy it.",5,I like being weird. Weird is all I've got.

Seasons One and Two were hilarious and, judged by those pre-set standards, I couldn't help feeling that Season Three came out of the gate a little sluggishly.  Was creator-writer Graham Linehan (of ""Father Ted"" fame) coasting just a little?The first four episodes - From Hell, Are We Not Men?, Tramps like Us, and Speech - all succeed on their own terms and have plenty of laughs.  But I've come to expect more from Roy, Moss and Jen.  Sure, I like the way each episode introduces a variety of disparate elements and then uses them all to great comic effect.  For example, when Roy gives a homeless guy 50p but criticizes his hard-luck story in episode three, we know that's a sentiment that will come back to haunt him.  As soon as Roy and Moss bluff their way into the hearts of some ""real men"" in episode two, we know there's trouble in store. And it's funny to see Jen take her employee of the month award so seriously - even putting an Oprah quote on her office door - in episode four.  Through the end of episode four, most of this season's surprises come from Douglas Reynholm (Matt Berry), the boorish boss who is forced to wear ""electric sex pants"" as part of a harassment settlement and gets to date a post-op transsexual, too.The season reclaims past heights with episodes five and six - Friendface and Calendar Geeks.  The intro to the Friendface episode , with its takedown of social networking sites (""don't think about germs...""), is uproarious.  The episode pokes fun at all aspects of the social networking phenomenon in ways big and small, while staying true to its nerdy roots and its specific character quirks (for example Moss is mildly disgusted to be told his newly friended mom's ""current mood"").  Episode six starts with Roy finagling his way into the photography assignment for a nude charity calendar - only to see the assignment morph into something that could haunt him for life.If you enjoyed Seasons One and Two of The IT Crowd, you won't want to miss Season Three.If you're new to the show and want to sample a 22-minute burst, then start with Friendface and reboot from there.",5,"4 Stars for the First Four Episodes, 5 Stars for the Last Two",1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,2222,"['Maybe', 'Season', 'Three', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'carried', 'burden', 'high', 'expectations', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'were', 'hilarious', 'judged', 'pre-set', 'standards', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'Season', 'Three', 'came', 'gate', 'little', 'sluggishly', 'Was', 'creator-writer', 'Graham', 'Linehan', 'Father', 'Ted', 'fame', 'coasting', 'just', 'little', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'From', 'Hell', 'Are', 'Not', 'Men', 'Tramps', 'Us', 'Speech', 'succeed', 'own', 'terms', 'have', 'plenty', 'laughs', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'more', 'Roy', 'Moss', 'Jen', 'Sure', 'like', 'way', 'episode', 'variety', 'disparate', 'elements', 'then', 'great', 'comic', 'effect', 'example', 'when', 'Roy', 'homeless', 'guy', '50p', 'hard-luck', 'story', 'episode', 'three', 'know', 'sentiment', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'As', 'soon', 'Roy', 'Moss', 'bluff', 'way', 'hearts', 'real', 'men', 'episode', 'two', 'know', 'trouble', 'store', 'funny', 'see', 'Jen', 'take', 'employee', 'month', 'award', 'so', 'seriously', 'even', 'putting', 'Oprah', 'quote', 'office', 'door', 'four', 'end', 'episode', 'four', 'most', 'season', 'surprises', 'come', 'Douglas', 'Reynholm', 'Matt', 'Berry', 'boorish', 'boss', 'who', 'forced', 'wear', 'electric', 'sex', 'pants', 'part', 'harassment', 'settlement', 'date', 'post-op', 'transsexual', 'too.The', 'season', 'reclaims', 'heights', 'episodes', 'five', 'six', 'Friendface', 'Calendar', 'Geeks', 'intro', 'Friendface', 'episode', 'takedown', 'social', 'networking', 'sites', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'germs', 'uproarious', 'episode', 'fun', 'aspects', 'social', 'networking', 'phenomenon', 'ways', 'big', 'small', 'staying', 'true', 'nerdy', 'roots', 'specific', 'character', 'quirks', 'example', 'Moss', 'mildly', 'disgusted', 'be', 'told', 'newly', 'friended', 'mom', 'current', 'mood', 'Episode', 'six', 'Roy', 'finagling', 'way', 'photography', 'assignment', 'nude', 'charity', 'calendar', 'only', 'see', 'assignment', 'morph', 'something', 'could', 'haunt', 'life.If', 'enjoyed', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'Season', 'Three.If', ""'re"", 'new', 'show', 'want', 'sample', '22-minute', 'burst', 'then', 'start', 'Friendface', 'reboot', 'there']",The IT Crowd: Season 3

Ratcliffe ""wearevinyl""","[4, 4]","As I approach middle-age, In watching tv, i have witnessed many a tv show, both American, and from the UK.This was recommended to me by a friend who claimed it was not just funny, but at times outrageous. At the time I bought this, Series 2 was also released, so i purchased both.What a wise move.The show is not as outrageous as was told, but is pure fun. I am still laughing at one joke, where the female boss of the IT department in a meeting of higher-ups claims that 'If you type Google within the Google site, you will break the internet'. Ok, is not as funny in print, but seeing it made my sides split.Ross is my favorite. He is so hysterical, and what comes out of his mouth is so endearing, and all else that happens to the 3 employees of a business that has yet to say what they do believe it or not makes a classic tv show. Not offensive, and yet at times a little risque, you sense to be part of a family who work leisurely among those who think they know everything, but when it comes to computers, are clueless. It gives a new meaning to 'Is your computer turned on?'.Love this show!",5,In The Makings Of A New Britcom Classic,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,1098,"['approach', 'middle-age', 'watching', 'tv', 'i', 'have', 'witnessed', 'many', 'tv', 'show', 'American', 'UK.This', 'was', 'recommended', 'friend', 'who', 'claimed', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'funny', 'times', 'outrageous', 'time', 'bought', 'Series', '2', 'was', 'also', 'released', 'i', 'purchased', 'both.What', 'wise', 'move.The', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'outrageous', 'was', 'told', 'pure', 'fun', 'am', 'still', 'laughing', 'one', 'joke', 'where', 'female', 'boss', 'IT', 'department', 'meeting', 'higher-ups', 'claims', ""'If"", 'type', 'Google', 'Google', 'site', 'will', 'break', 'internet', 'Ok', 'not', 'funny', 'print', 'seeing', 'made', 'sides', 'split.Ross', 'favorite', 'so', 'hysterical', 'what', 'out', 'mouth', 'so', 'endearing', 'else', '3', 'employees', 'business', 'yet', 'say', 'what', 'do', 'believe', 'not', 'classic', 'tv', 'show', 'Not', 'offensive', 'yet', 'times', 'little', 'risque', 'sense', 'be', 'part', 'family', 'who', 'work', 'leisurely', 'who', 'think', 'know', 'everything', 'when', 'computers', 'are', 'clueless', 'new', 'meaning', ""'Is"", 'computer', 'turned', 'show']",The IT Crowd: Season 3
