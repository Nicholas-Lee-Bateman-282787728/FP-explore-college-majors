891947,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B0007VY5JO,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[10, 11]","'Ghost Lake' is the latest direct-to-DVD horror flick that has sodomized both me and my DVD player.  When will I ever learn to stop renting stuff like this?The story(or what passes for one)goes something like this:  a local slut(Tatum Adair, who looks like a low-rent Russian version of Naomi Watts)is out getting nailed in the backseat of her car while her loving parents are at home dying from a gas leak.  I'm serous.  This is actually how the movie begins and is unfortunately the highpoint of its two-hour running time.  So the Slut feels guilty, leaves town, and drives to her family's lakeside cabin.  Along the way she picks up some dude alongside the road(Timothy Prindle, who looks like a homosexual Lorenzo Lamas)and takes him to her cabin...I told you she was a slut.  Once there, the cute couple uncover a horrible mystery about dead people rising from the lake to kill again.  Throw in a sheriff who resembles Judge Reinhold with a lisp, an annoying little girl with incredibly large teeth, and you have got one crappy film.I try to give low-budget flicks the benefit of the doubt, but 'Ghost Lake' just doesn't deserve it.  The acting is putrid.  Every bit of dialogue uttered is horrible and the script is pathetic.  My favorite line in the film is when the Slut says ""I can't be with anyone right now...you know, sexually."" and then nails Lorenzo Lamas a minute later.  Hilarious.  There is not one single moment of decent acting in this entire film.  As for the special effects:  I could've done better with some scotch tape, a bed sheet, and a bottle of cranberry juice.  They're pathetic.'Ghost Lake' is honestly one of the most putrid(and boring)films I've ever had the displeasure of seeing.  There are so many gaps in logic and plot that it seems like a series of unconnected scenes rather than a coherent narrative.  The acting is absolutely awful as is everything else in this crapfest.  But probably the worst of all is the terrible(and confusing) editing.  Moments go by and you have no idea what is going on.  And by the end of the film you'll have no idea why it was even made.Avoid 'Ghost Lake' like it was naked pictures of your mother.",1,Crap Lake,1121472000,"07 16, 2005",2005,2167,"[""'Ghost"", 'Lake', 'latest', 'direct-to-DVD', 'horror', 'flick', 'sodomized', 'DVD', 'player', 'When', 'will', 'ever', 'learn', 'stop', 'renting', 'stuff', 'story', 'what', 'one', 'something', 'local', 'slut', 'Tatum', 'Adair', 'who', 'low-rent', 'Russian', 'version', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'out', 'getting', 'nailed', 'backseat', 'car', 'loving', 'parents', 'are', 'home', 'dying', 'gas', 'leak', ""'m"", 'serous', 'actually', 'how', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'highpoint', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'Slut', 'feels', 'guilty', 'town', 'family', 'lakeside', 'cabin', 'way', 'up', 'dude', 'road', 'Timothy', 'Prindle', 'who', 'homosexual', 'Lorenzo', 'Lamas', 'cabin', 'told', 'was', 'slut', 'Once', 'there', 'cute', 'couple', 'horrible', 'mystery', 'dead', 'people', 'rising', 'lake', 'kill', 'again', 'Throw', 'sheriff', 'who', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'lisp', 'annoying', 'little', 'girl', 'incredibly', 'large', 'teeth', 'have', 'got', 'one', 'crappy', 'film.I', 'try', 'give', 'low-budget', 'flicks', 'benefit', 'doubt', ""'Ghost"", 'Lake', 'just', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'acting', 'putrid', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'uttered', 'horrible', 'script', 'pathetic', 'favorite', 'line', 'film', 'when', 'Slut', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'anyone', 'right', 'now', 'know', 'sexually', 'then', 'nails', 'Lorenzo', 'Lamas', 'minute', 'later', 'Hilarious', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'moment', 'decent', 'acting', 'entire', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'scotch', 'tape', 'bed', 'sheet', 'bottle', 'cranberry', 'juice', ""'re"", 'pathetic', ""'Ghost"", 'Lake', 'honestly', 'one', 'most', 'putrid', 'boring', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'displeasure', 'seeing', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'gaps', 'logic', 'plot', 'series', 'unconnected', 'scenes', 'rather', 'coherent', 'narrative', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'everything', 'else', 'crapfest', 'probably', 'worst', 'terrible', 'confusing', 'editing', 'Moments', 'go', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'end', 'film', ""'ll"", 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'was', 'even', 'made.Avoid', ""'Ghost"", 'Lake', 'was', 'naked', 'pictures', 'mother']",Ghost Lake

After 15 mins, it nearly put me to sleep. The acting is poor, the editing is laughable and the special effects are mediocre at best. These actors do not even put the slightest effort into making their characters believable and it makes me think that I did better at the school-play as a 14 year old. It's that bad.

I thought it was going to be a 'B' science fiction movie when it began and the blonde tramp got out of her dress to have sex in a car.  I figured she was obviously a minor character who was going to be served up as fodder for whatever bad thing was lurking later in the movie. She was someone who obviously the audience could feel would make the world better by getting ravaged by some evil force.  It turned out that this slut was actually the main character who we were supposed to sympathize with and cheer for....OH oh, this was a bad sign!!!  The actress who played this plum role was Tatum Adair (apparently even Tara Reid has her standards).  The plot has something to do with dead people in a lake who need to fill a quota to either ease their pain, end the curse or put the curse on to some other unsuspecting folk..something like that anyway.  I gave this movie 2 stars because I made it all the way through without shutting it off and did not feel totally ripped off by watching it.  The movie wasn't great...not even good but it was somewhat diverting. As for special effects...Well, I think most people could do better in their basement with a video camera, some fishing line, a few plastic models and a nylon stocking....Think about it.  Anyway, don't buy this piece of work, but if you don't mind some mind numbing special effects and some really bad acting, it is kind of fun...One more thing.
