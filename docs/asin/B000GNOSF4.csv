1005950,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000GNOSF4,Artist & Author,"[2, 2]","Although this movie is listed as a suspense or thriller movie, it really is more of a mystery movie.  I don't know who gave this movie an 'R' rating because, as most, it is more like a 'PG' movies.  My ten-year-old granddaughter watched it with me, and she liked it so much she begged to keep it to show to her girlfriends coming over for a Halloween sleep-over.As we were watching it, I thought that if this is based on a true story, it is genuinely amazing.  It turns out, however, that there was a real Lucy Keyes who disappeared some 250 years ago without a trace, but this story is one person's idea of what could have happened to her.  I have to say that it is an imaginative story about Lucy that arrives at a relatively exciting conclusion (especially for little girls!).  We could have done without the 'evil land developer' angle, which is so common in movies that it could hardly be considered imaginative or new.There are a couple of scenes that might be uncomfortable for traditional values families, so you might watch for them and fast forward or talk about it with your kids.  Other than that, this is a movie the whole family could watch and to try to figure out before the end what really happened to little Lucy.  I think most school-age kids could handle the movie if watched with their parents.",4,A Mystery More than a Suspense Movie,1225152000,"10 28, 2008",2008,1315,"['movie', 'listed', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'movie', 'really', 'more', 'mystery', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'gave', 'movie', 'R', 'rating', 'because', 'most', 'more', ""'PG"", 'movies', 'ten-year-old', 'granddaughter', 'watched', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'begged', 'keep', 'show', 'girlfriends', 'coming', 'Halloween', 'sleep-over.As', 'were', 'watching', 'thought', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'genuinely', 'amazing', 'out', 'however', 'was', 'real', 'Lucy', 'Keyes', 'who', 'disappeared', '250', 'years', 'ago', 'trace', 'story', 'one', 'person', 'idea', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'have', 'say', 'imaginative', 'story', 'Lucy', 'relatively', 'exciting', 'conclusion', 'especially', 'little', 'girls', 'could', 'have', 'done', ""'evil"", 'land', 'developer', 'angle', 'so', 'common', 'movies', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'considered', 'imaginative', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'might', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'traditional', 'values', 'families', 'might', 'watch', 'fast', 'forward', 'talk', 'kids', 'Other', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'could', 'watch', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'end', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'little', 'Lucy', 'think', 'most', 'school-age', 'kids', 'could', 'handle', 'movie', 'watched', 'parents']",The Legend of Lucy Keyes

Based on the true story of Lucy Keyes, this 'independent' psychological thriller delivers the goods in some ways better than those films made in Hollywood. I loved it.

You've seen it all before, and it's been better.  Predictable and truly a waste of your time.  Some of the worst acting comes from the biggest name here, Brooke Adams.  What was she thinking?  Oh, wait, clearly she wasn't.  Hope she was paid well.  City couple who've lost a child in an accident move to the country with their surviving children when the husband gets an offer for a potential job (not the actual job, mind you, but a potential job) contingent on the town voting on a windmill project.  From the get-go, it's obvious who the real villain is here and who the true looney is.  Indeed, the best acting in the entire film comes from Mark Boone, Jr., as the resident loon.  Alas, Boone cannot carry the film.  The two leads are uninspired and uninspiring.  The male lead in particular is hard to like (he actually urinates at his property boundary to mark it).  One might feel something for the female lead, but her character is never developed.  No character is.

1005960,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000GNOSF4,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 7]","They say the film is based on the real events about a missing 4-year-old girl Lucy, who lived in rural New England about 250 years ago. In ""The Legend of Lucy Keyes"" writer and director John Stimpson creates a fictional story about the Cooley family (Julie Delpy, Justin Thetoux, Cassidy Hincke and Kathleen Regan), who just arrived in the rural town for their father's work of the windmill project, and the director connects the contemporary fiction about the urban family to the facts about Lucy Keyes and the mystery surrounding her.The concept looks brilliant on paper, but as the film goes on, we notice it doesn't work as it looked at first. The biggest problem is the story of the Cooleys, which is saddled with many familiar items seen in the films about haunted house or horror films in general. An old lady warns against the new project, and says the place where the windmills are to be built is haunted. A strange neighbor does something weird and annoying - heap of clam bellies - and again warns the Cooleys that they don't know anything about the woods. When Delpy's mother wants to research the local history, she is seen turning pages in the library. Why doesn't she just leave the town with her daughters is more mysterious than the entire plot of the film.Things get worse, however, as what you know will happen will not happen very fast. The story is repetitious, the stock characters as I mentioned above appear one too many times and the film's overall pace is too slow. Once we know the drift of the story, it does not surprise us any more. The truths about the missing Lucy are revealed as another Lucy's story unfolds, but frankly I didn't find the latter interesting very much, and the neat conclusion requires enormous leap of faith even by the standard of occult thriller.To me the greatest attraction of ""The Legend of Lucy Keyes"" was the film's star Julie Delpy, whose previous works include such as fantastic ""Before Sunrise"" and equally wonderful ""Before Sunset,"" and embarrassingly bad ""An American Werewolf in Paris."" I just don't understand why Paris-born Julie Delpy should be cast as mother of two daughters living in New England while Jeanne's role doesn't need to be French. Also, I admire her beauty and am ready to admit acting talent, but I don't think screaming or being terrified is not her forte. And Justin Theroux is not required to do much.""The Legend of Lucy Keyes"" is mildly entertaining with its authentic locations.

1005961,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000GNOSF4,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","I watched this on LMN the other night and plan to purchase the DVD for my mother who loves stories rooted in the supernatural. Based on a true story, ""The Legend of Lucy Keyes"" stars the talented Julie Delpy as Jeanne Cooley who moves with her husband Guy [Justin Theroux], and daughters Molly [Kathleen Regan] and Lucy [Cassidy Hinkle] to rural New England, specifically the town of Princeton, MA where Guy is working on a windmill project under the supervision of local councilwoman Samantha Porter [Brooke Adams]. Before long, the Cooleys discover that quite a few of the townspeople are not in favor of the project and make their objections known, specifically Gretchen Caswell [Jamie Donnelly] who is the unofficial keeper of the town's heritage, and hostile/creepy next-door neighbor Jonas Dodd.Jeanne who is also grieving the tragic death of her youngest daughter, keeps hearing a woman's voice from the woods, a voice that seems to be calling out for something she has lost, and as Jeanne digs into the history of the old farmhouse they occupy, she discovers the mysterious disappearance of 6-year-old Lucy Keyes back in the 1700s, and how the tragedy caused her mother to go almost insane. The rest of the movie revolves around Jeanne trying to solve the mystery of the disembodied voice and figuring out her own daughter's [Lucy] role in the mystery.The movie is actually quite engaging and well-made, despite being more of a made-for-TV type of show. The production qualities are impressive, with beautiful cinematography of the lush New England landscape. The acting is also quite credible, especially Julie Delpy's grieving/conflicted mother, who shares a strong affinity with her younger daughter, reminiscent of Lucy Keyes' own deep bond with her mother. Justin Theroux does not really impress in his role as the husband/father, remaining a secondary character for most of the movie. The other stand-out performance was by the little girl who plays Lucy Cooley. She is not only adorable but is also credible in her role without being annoying. The guy who plays the creepy neighbor also does a good job.The special effects are nothing to shout about, and this is not a scary movie. It is more of a supernatural thriller with more suspense elements than real horror, which makes it a decent family drama.
