713375,A13DD17X1AZFGJ,B00006FDCI,A. Butterfield,"[5, 7]","'What's Up Doc?' is a five-star movie, no doubt about that. Streisand's best role probably, and a film that's so well made it will be watched for years to come. It's so good, people tend to learn half the script to quote in everyday life. But we knew that was good.I wanted to have that on DVD, and thought I may as well, considering the price, have three other movies as a bonus.The best of the rest is 'Nuts', and Barbra gives a truly compelling performance alongside an excellent Dreyfuss. It's a good pairing. The script is good, and the movie, whilst not exactly ground breaking, is pretty good.'Up the Sandbox' is a curiosity, but not entirely a success. What I do like is Barbra's rather ordinary character Margaret, which she plays with understatement and compassion. What I don't like is when her fantasies are extended into fifteen minute epics, one like a very poor James Bond episode, and one tedious African jungle adventure. The director used poor judgement here. Still, it's an interesting period piece, and I love the bit when Barbra shoves her mother's head into her birthday cake...'The Main Event' is dreadful. It's the clunker of the four. Our Barbra, sporting a hideous hairdo of tight red curls, plays a woman who coaches a boxer who dropped out after an earlier incident, and there are scenes of boxing, training, and guess what happens at the end? It's impossible to make it sound interesting. The plot is tedious, the script awful and the actors desperate-seeming. The only good thing about this DVD is that it props up the other ones in the box set.But hey, you're still getting 'What's Up Doc?' so who's complaining?The bonus is that there are good extra features on the DVDs: commentary by Barbra herself, then the director, and one or two ther bits and pieces, like a mini-documentary from US TV about the making of 'Up the Sandbox'. The commentary is from 2003, so it's nicely up to date and offers an interesting view of the past by actors and directors.",4,One great movie,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,1985,"['Up', 'Doc', 'five-star', 'movie', 'doubt', 'Streisand', 'best', 'role', 'probably', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'will', 'be', 'watched', 'years', 'come', 'so', 'good', 'people', 'tend', 'learn', 'script', 'quote', 'everyday', 'life', 'knew', 'was', 'good.I', 'wanted', 'have', 'DVD', 'thought', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'considering', 'price', 'have', 'three', 'other', 'movies', 'bonus.The', 'best', 'rest', ""'Nuts"", 'Barbra', 'truly', 'compelling', 'performance', 'excellent', 'Dreyfuss', 'good', 'pairing', 'script', 'good', 'movie', 'whilst', 'not', 'exactly', 'ground', 'breaking', 'pretty', 'good', ""'Up"", 'Sandbox', 'curiosity', 'not', 'entirely', 'success', 'What', 'do', 'Barbra', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'character', 'Margaret', 'understatement', 'compassion', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'fantasies', 'are', 'extended', 'fifteen', 'minute', 'epics', 'one', 'very', 'poor', 'James', 'Bond', 'episode', 'one', 'tedious', 'African', 'jungle', 'adventure', 'director', 'used', 'poor', 'judgement', 'here', 'Still', 'interesting', 'period', 'piece', 'love', 'bit', 'when', 'Barbra', 'mother', 'head', 'birthday', 'cake', 'Main', 'Event', 'dreadful', 'clunker', 'four', 'Barbra', 'sporting', 'hideous', 'hairdo', 'tight', 'red', 'curls', 'woman', 'who', 'boxer', 'who', 'dropped', 'out', 'earlier', 'incident', 'are', 'scenes', 'boxing', 'training', 'guess', 'what', 'end', 'impossible', 'make', 'sound', 'interesting', 'plot', 'tedious', 'script', 'awful', 'actors', 'desperate-seeming', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'DVD', 'other', 'ones', 'box', 'set.But', 'hey', ""'re"", 'still', 'getting', 'Up', 'Doc', 'who', 'complaining', 'bonus', 'are', 'good', 'extra', 'features', 'DVDs', 'commentary', 'Barbra', 'then', 'director', 'one', 'two', 'bits', 'pieces', 'mini-documentary', 'US', 'TV', 'making', 'Sandbox', 'commentary', '2003', 'nicely', 'date', 'interesting', 'view', 'past', 'actors', 'directors']","Barbra Streisand Collection: (What's Up, Doc? / The Main Event / Up the Sandbox / Nuts)"

WHAT'S UP DOC is a terrific example of a screwball comedy with a winning cast.  Barbra Streisand is laugh-out-loud funny, with spot-on timing and is sexy and tanned to boot on screen. UP THE SANDBOX, dramatically, is unlike anything Streisand ever did before or after... it took courage to take-on a role like this, and she can be proud of the ""real woman"" qualities that she brought to the role.  THE MAIN EVENT is a good try... it has its funny moments and Streisand gives it her best.  It's just not a terrific script.  NUTS, however, is underrated... not only is the supporting cast superb, but Streisand gave a performance worthy of an Academy Award nomination.  In all fairness, this is a terrific and enjoyable set, by an artist who has given much to the world of entertainment.
