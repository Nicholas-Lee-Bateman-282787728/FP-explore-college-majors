1227680,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B001PO550A,calvinnme,"[10, 15]","It is odd that Warner Home Video chose ""Broadway Musicals"" instead of some other category of musicals for a collection. This is TCM/WHV's attempt to bring the classic films to DVD cheaply, and it's a noble cause. The one film in this bunch I don't care for is ""Annie Get Your Gun"". I'm not going to blame Betty Hutton for this one. She actually got the part and I don't think Judy Garland would have done a better job. Actually, the problem is Howard Keel, who is the leading man in all four of these films. He was a real disappointment here. For those who like all of the trimmings there isSeven Brides for Seven Brothers (Two-Disc Special Edition)versus the plain version here. WHV owns all of the versions of Showboat on film, and in my opinion the 1951 version you get here is weaker than the 1936 version - not currently on DVD - mainly because Howard Keel's character is supposed to be a tower of Jello, and it is just too much of a suspense of belief to believe Howard Keel as such a character. Finally, ""Kiss Me Kate"" is a fantastic musical that plays to all of Howard Keel's strengths. It already exists in theClassic Musicals Collection - The Cole Porter Gift Set (High Society / Kiss Me Kate / Les Girls / Broadway Melody of 1940 / Silk Stockings), again for those of you who like all of the trimmings and extras.For those of you who buy WHV classics on a regular basis I'm going to tell you why I'd hold off on this one. It's a suspicion of mine. TCM is scheduled to show the 1929 version of Showboat in April. They have been showing an upgraded version of the 1951 version, which I assume you get here versus the older rather washed-out one. In December 2007 TCM aired the 1936 version of Showboat (the best version in my opinion) and the voiceover introduction mentioned that there was a commentary track embedded in the film. WHV has been promising the 1929/1936/1951 versions of Showboat for two years now. Nobody - not even TCM - shows a 1929 part-talkie musical (1929's Showboat) for the fun of it. Nobody installs a commentary track in a 73 year old film for the fun of it either. I suspect WHV is getting ready to announce the long-awaited trilogy of Showboat movies.

Show Boat, Annie Get Your Gun, Kiss Me Kate, and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers are some of the best Hollywood musicals ever produced and the sumptuous production quality of MGM is absolutely dreamy.

You can get oils from the top of 1 disk and smudged / scratch the disk above/below.
