Mr. Mambo King at heart: Mr. Garner was the true definement of &quot;Mr. Pianoman&quot;. There is no mistaking about that. What a marvelous arrangement of Mr. Garner's left hand was. His left hand appears (to many other pianists) as if its his &quot;RIGHT HAND&quot;. Mr. Garner appears to have two right hands!)My mentor's (Mr. Garner's) recording is presented with class, pride, and an endearment to his music and piano, as witnessed on this DVD, which is to me a most treasurable (and invaluable) piece of item I AM SO PROUD TO OWN.

711755,A2HWPTLXOLI2BQ,B00006CXGR,Daniel Fineberg,"[38, 38]","When I heard that they were releasing a DVD of Erroll Garner in performance--a full 70 minutes from a 1964 BBC special--I just about hit the ceiling. By 1964, Garner was quite out of fashion, what with the avant-garde ramblings of Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman and the likes taking center stage, but he had lost very little of his power. Now, years later, all those experimental trends fall away in the presence of Garner's genius. He's joined that uppermost level of jazz pianists--along with Art Tatum, Bud Powell, Monk, Bill Evans, and a tiny handful of others who have become genres of one...singular geniuses. Garner, like Monk, like Tatum, used all of the keyboard, making 88 keys sound like 188. He was a one-man orchestra. But even more astonishing than his technique was his fresh interpretation of standards, almost like intense studies of the compositions. He'd take a tune like &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; or &quot;I Cover the Waterfront&quot;, slow them down, expose and explore every nuance of the melody, make it new. His playing was often baroque, often complex, but always beautiful, and he never even learned to read music. This performance has about 17 tunes, though strangely, he does not play &quot;Misty&quot;, his extraordinary signature tune that he played night after night. However, the guys behind the DVD had their thinking caps on, and added an audio performance of it. Now you're out of excuses.",5,Goodness gracious,1064707200,"09 28, 2003",2003,1423,"['When', 'heard', 'were', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'Erroll', 'Garner', 'performance', 'full', '70', 'minutes', '1964', 'BBC', 'special', 'just', 'ceiling', '1964', 'Garner', 'was', 'quite', 'fashion', 'what', 'avant-garde', 'ramblings', 'Cecil', 'Taylor', 'Ornette', 'Coleman', 'likes', 'taking', 'center', 'stage', 'had', 'lost', 'very', 'little', 'power', 'Now', 'years', 'later', 'experimental', 'trends', 'fall', 'away', 'presence', 'Garner', 'genius', 'joined', 'uppermost', 'level', 'jazz', 'pianists', 'Art', 'Tatum', 'Bud', 'Powell', 'Monk', 'Bill', 'Evans', 'tiny', 'handful', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'genres', 'one', 'singular', 'geniuses', 'Garner', 'Monk', 'Tatum', 'used', 'keyboard', 'making', '88', 'keys', 'sound', '188', 'was', 'one-man', 'orchestra', 'even', 'more', 'astonishing', 'technique', 'was', 'fresh', 'interpretation', 'standards', 'almost', 'intense', 'studies', 'compositions', ""'d"", 'take', 'tune', 'quot', 'Autumn', 'Leaves', 'quot', 'quot', 'Cover', 'Waterfront', 'quot', 'slow', 'down', 'expose', 'explore', 'nuance', 'melody', 'make', 'new', 'playing', 'was', 'often', 'baroque', 'often', 'complex', 'always', 'beautiful', 'never', 'even', 'learned', 'read', 'music', 'performance', 'about', '17', 'tunes', 'strangely', 'not', 'play', 'quot', 'Misty', 'quot', 'extraordinary', 'signature', 'tune', 'played', 'night', 'night', 'However', 'guys', 'DVD', 'had', 'thinking', 'caps', 'added', 'audio', 'performance', 'Now', ""'re"", 'excuses']",N/A
711756,AQLKBEVHUQ0JK,B00006CXGR,"Eddie Landsberg ""My 10th year as a reviewer !...","[13, 13]","My favorite moment of this broadcast is a moment in the throws of one of Erroll Garner's legendary intro/improvisational tangents and Eddie Calhoun is just looking over at him totally bewildered, half embaressed, trying to figure out what's going on but thoroughly enjoying it... I guess that's the genius of Erroll Garner... Its hard not to on one hand take infinite pleasure in his playing, and on the other hand be totally bewildered...  Aside from being an original, even within his own sound and style, he was virtually impredictable - - yet everything he did not only would work out great in the long run - - but would rewrite the book on how the piano is played.  Another couple of observations - - He sits on a phone book as he plays, rarely watches his hands, and plays with such command and power that the baby grand piano actually looks like a little toy in his hands (*am I the only person who's ever observed this ?)  You really feel that the piano is in total submission to him.  - - Erroll Garner was indeed an imaginative genius and master entertainer... you can hear it on his albums, and now see it on this incredibly tasty looking and sounding crisp black and white TV broadcast.  I love when the host points out that even that people who don't really like Jazz dig him - - and for those who do, every time he sits down at the piano he reinvents the way its played.No doubt, there will never be another Eroll Garner... and I don't know whether to say its a darn shame... or to simply say, Thank God there simple WAS an Erroll Garner.  Its true... the piano *was* invented for him... and if you're not yet convinced, this video will do nothing to dispel the myth... only make it larger !",5,oh god... that's all I can say !,1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,1705,"['favorite', 'moment', 'broadcast', 'moment', 'throws', 'one', 'Erroll', 'Garner', 'legendary', 'intro/improvisational', 'tangents', 'Eddie', 'Calhoun', 'just', 'looking', 'over', 'totally', 'bewildered', 'half', 'embaressed', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'guess', 'genius', 'Erroll', 'Garner', 'hard', 'not', 'one', 'hand', 'take', 'infinite', 'pleasure', 'playing', 'other', 'hand', 'be', 'totally', 'bewildered', 'Aside', 'being', 'original', 'even', 'own', 'sound', 'style', 'was', 'virtually', 'impredictable', 'yet', 'everything', 'did', 'not', 'only', 'would', 'work', 'out', 'great', 'long', 'run', 'would', 'rewrite', 'book', 'how', 'piano', 'played', 'couple', 'observations', 'phone', 'book', 'rarely', 'hands', 'plays', 'such', 'command', 'power', 'baby', 'grand', 'piano', 'actually', 'little', 'toy', 'hands', '*am', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'ever', 'observed', 'really', 'feel', 'piano', 'total', 'submission', 'Erroll', 'Garner', 'was', 'indeed', 'imaginative', 'genius', 'master', 'entertainer', 'can', 'hear', 'albums', 'now', 'see', 'incredibly', 'looking', 'sounding', 'crisp', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'love', 'when', 'host', 'points', 'out', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'Jazz', 'dig', 'who', 'do', 'time', 'down', 'piano', 'way', 'played.No', 'doubt', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Eroll', 'Garner', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'say', 'darn', 'shame', 'simply', 'say', 'Thank', 'God', 'there', 'simple', 'WAS', 'Erroll', 'Garner', 'true', 'piano', '*was*', 'invented', ""'re"", 'not', 'yet', 'convinced', 'video', 'will', 'do', 'nothing', 'dispel', 'myth', 'only', 'make', 'larger']",N/A

How many jazz pianists are as instantly recognizable stylistically?  Watching and listening to him during this BBC-TV performance from 1964 is a joy.  His interaction with bassist Calhoun and drummer Martin should not be overlooked either.  Anyone who thinks Garner is superficial or formulaic simply isn't listening very closely.

711758,A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B00006CXGR,"Mike Tarrani ""Jazz Drummer""","[0, 0]","I'll confess that I stumbled across this video via a bootleg of one of the two segments on Youtube. That piqued my interest and I quickly found this DVD that chronicles both 35-minute performances. For a fan this is pure gold, and especially given the dearth of live video of Erroll in action.What makes this special is the energy and genius that flow from his fingers. You are treated to jazz improvisation as it unfolds. More importantly - to me at least - is the way the rhythm section locks in and stays there no matter what Erroll plays. That takes its own form of genius and especially when backing someone like Erroll.  Bassist Eddie Calhoun has a great touch and lays down his lines with authority. A lesser musician would have been intimidated into the background. I found Kelly Martin's playing to be tasteful and love the way he exhibited a keen sense of dynamics. There is a reason why Erroll kept them on as his rhythm section for a decade.It's Erroll's playing, though, that is the centerpiece of this performance. I own a pile of his albums, but seeing him in action is a jaw dropping experience. If you don't believe me just do a search for Erroll BBC 625 and watch snippets of the footage that is on this DVD.About the performances. They were recorded during two BBC broadcasts of Jazz 625 on October 22 and 31, 1964. That show was hosted by Steve Race who quickly fades into the background so the trio has maximum air time. The black and white footage is beautiful and the sound is surprisingly good too.Here is what was played for each segment:October 22, 19641-Honeysuckle Rose2-No more shadows3-Mambo Erroll4-Penthouse serenade5-Jeannine, I dream of lilac time6-On the street where you live7-I could have danced all night8-A new kind of love9-The lady is a tramp10-UntitledOctober 31, 19641-Just one of those things2-What is this thing called love?3-Dreamy4-Spring is here5-Lover6-It might as well be spring7-Laura8-Sonny boy9-Erroll's themeIf you love this DVD you will probably also loveJazz Icons: Erroll Garner Live in '63 & '64.",5,Rare video of Erroll backed by his strongest trio,1369353600,"05 24, 2013",2013,2054,"[""'ll"", 'confess', 'stumbled', 'video', 'bootleg', 'one', 'two', 'segments', 'Youtube', 'piqued', 'interest', 'quickly', 'found', 'DVD', '35-minute', 'performances', 'fan', 'pure', 'gold', 'especially', 'given', 'dearth', 'live', 'video', 'Erroll', 'action.What', 'special', 'energy', 'genius', 'flow', 'fingers', 'are', 'treated', 'jazz', 'improvisation', 'More', 'importantly', 'least', 'way', 'rhythm', 'section', 'locks', 'stays', 'there', 'matter', 'what', 'Erroll', 'own', 'form', 'genius', 'especially', 'when', 'backing', 'someone', 'Erroll', 'Bassist', 'Eddie', 'Calhoun', 'great', 'touch', 'down', 'lines', 'authority', 'lesser', 'musician', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'intimidated', 'background', 'found', 'Kelly', 'Martin', 'playing', 'be', 'tasteful', 'love', 'way', 'exhibited', 'keen', 'sense', 'dynamics', 'reason', 'why', 'Erroll', 'kept', 'rhythm', 'section', 'decade.It', 'Erroll', 'playing', 'though', 'centerpiece', 'performance', 'own', 'pile', 'albums', 'seeing', 'action', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'just', 'do', 'search', 'Erroll', 'BBC', '625', 'watch', 'snippets', 'footage', 'DVD.About', 'performances', 'were', 'recorded', 'two', 'BBC', 'broadcasts', 'Jazz', '625', 'October', '22', '31', '1964', 'show', 'was', 'hosted', 'Steve', 'Race', 'who', 'quickly', 'background', 'trio', 'maximum', 'air', 'time', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'beautiful', 'sound', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'too.Here', 'what', 'was', 'played', 'segment', 'October', '22', '19641-Honeysuckle', 'Rose2-No', 'more', 'shadows3-Mambo', 'Erroll4-Penthouse', 'serenade5-Jeannine', 'dream', 'lilac', 'time6-On', 'street', 'where', 'live7-I', 'could', 'have', 'danced', 'night8-A', 'new', 'kind', 'love9-The', 'lady', 'tramp10-UntitledOctober', '31', '19641-Just', 'one', 'thing', 'called', 'love', '3-Dreamy4-Spring', 'here5-Lover6-It', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'spring7-Laura8-Sonny', 'boy9-Erroll', 'themeIf', 'love', 'DVD', 'will', 'probably', 'also', 'loveJazz', 'Icons', 'Erroll', 'Garner', 'Live', ""'63"", ""'64""]",N/A
711759,A13IKSGDYNBNQS,B00006CXGR,S J Buck,"[3, 3]","This is a must buy for any Jazz fan. Licenced by the BBC for release in the U.S. but not available over in the UK, you get two sets of Garner with bass player Eddie Calhoun and drummer Kelly Martin. Even more amazing is that when the BBC repeated Jazz 625 in the 1980's they only showed one half the show. This disc contains both halves.As you'd expect the playing from Garner is incredible. Take 'Honeysuckle Rose' as an example. A long introduction, during which the drummer and bass player have no idea when they are supposed to come in. This features a little bit of Boogie Woogie and stride and then suddenly the tune starts and Garner is flying. The distinctive lagging right hand spells out the tune and then there are a few choruses of sparking improvisations. Then to cap it all a long stride section recalling memories of Fats Waller and culminating in a modulation through multiple keys to the finish.Garner alternates between his uptempo swinging stuff (or occasional mambo style) with his distinctively florid ballad playing, which creates a nice contrast. The picture quality is reasonable for 1964, and the sound is pretty good. There is a bonus audio only version of Misty played over some photos of Garner performing elsewhere.Buy it now before it becomes completely unavailable.",5,Garner the Giant of Jazz,1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,1296,"['must', 'buy', 'Jazz', 'fan', 'Licenced', 'BBC', 'release', 'U.S.', 'not', 'available', 'UK', 'get', 'two', 'sets', 'Garner', 'bass', 'player', 'Eddie', 'Calhoun', 'drummer', 'Kelly', 'Martin', 'Even', 'more', 'amazing', 'when', 'BBC', 'repeated', 'Jazz', '625', '1980', 'only', 'showed', 'one', 'show', 'disc', 'halves.As', ""'d"", 'expect', 'playing', 'Garner', 'incredible', 'Take', ""'Honeysuckle"", 'Rose', 'example', 'long', 'introduction', 'drummer', 'bass', 'player', 'have', 'idea', 'when', 'are', 'supposed', 'come', 'little', 'bit', 'Boogie', 'Woogie', 'stride', 'then', 'suddenly', 'tune', 'Garner', 'flying', 'distinctive', 'lagging', 'right', 'hand', 'out', 'tune', 'then', 'are', 'few', 'choruses', 'sparking', 'improvisations', 'Then', 'cap', 'long', 'stride', 'section', 'recalling', 'memories', 'Fats', 'Waller', 'culminating', 'modulation', 'multiple', 'keys', 'finish.Garner', 'uptempo', 'swinging', 'stuff', 'occasional', 'mambo', 'style', 'distinctively', 'florid', 'ballad', 'playing', 'nice', 'contrast', 'picture', 'quality', 'reasonable', '1964', 'sound', 'pretty', 'good', 'bonus', 'audio', 'only', 'version', 'Misty', 'played', 'over', 'photos', 'Garner', 'performing', 'now', 'completely', 'unavailable']",N/A
