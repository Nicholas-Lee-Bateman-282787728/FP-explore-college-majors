715878,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00006HAWV,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[4, 4]","Serial killers and their actions and motivations can be incredibly intriguing and boggle the mind. I have always been interested in what goes on in these people's heads and what brings them to the point of killing people. One of the worst, if not probably the worst, mass serial killer of all time in America's history, is Ted Bundy. Just the name alone can send chills and bring up horrible stories from years past. For those who aren't in the know or have simply lost some knowledge of him over the years, Ted Bundy murdered at least 28 women, although some say there could very well be more, between 1974 and 1978. Most of his crimes were commited in the areas of Oregon, Colorado, Utah, Florida, and here in Washington. One girl's grave from around here I just found the other day. The movie also shows and deals with Ted's escape from prison and his soon to be recapture. He is portrayed here by Michael Reilly Burke. There is no other Ted Bundy than Mark Harmon(from 1986's &quot;The Deliberate Stranger&quot;), but Burke becomes the character and for the hour and a half that you are watching him, I found myself to believe that he is this guy and that he is able to do the things that he does in the film. The best and most interesting part of this film belongs to Burke. His opening scene in the mirror was downright creepy and his subsequent &quot;episodes&quot; are blood chilling and sick. Burke has the right handsome looks and sweet charm to him that made Bundy able to pick up the women he did. But those ah schucks looks and cool presence swiftly turn deadly and sadistic and Burke really comes across as the guy you wouldn't expect to turn into a raging loony. But the problem with this film is how it seems to be more of an Afterschool Special version on the Bundy legacy than a real docu type film that digs up all the dirt and lets everyone in on this guy's psyche. Not that it is easily watchable, because there are hardcore moments here that don't shy away from the brutalness, but I meant that it seems to opnly scratch the surface of the man instead of going in deeper into who he was and where he came from. The mentioning of his mixed up family upbringing was something to of fully explore, but the movie never goes there. It jumps from one gruesome scene to the next, and even though it is realistically shot and Burke pulls it off, the whole project and story comes off as feeling a bit hollow and empty. It felt to me like a cliff's notes version of the real story. &quot;The Deliberate Stranger&quot; was 4 hours, and this one clicks in at around 90 minutes when the credits start to roll. There isn't much of a cast except Botti Ann Bliss as his girlfriend. She looks like she's from the '70's and is pleasant to look at, but many of her scenes feature how lacking she is in the acting department. Some of the most interesting moments of the film are when real pictures or real film from the news about Ted and his eventual execution in 1989 are shown. That was a fantastic touch to put in the film. And the moments leading to Ted's ultimate death by electric chair are shown and given the audience a first time look at what goes on beforehand. It was a first. These moments with the swelling of music in the background and Ted breaking down make it seem like he was a wronged man and we should feel sorry for him. Obviously, we don't, but that's just the way it felt when the scene was playing. The movie wasn't all bad at all, but it could of been so much more. It's not a film with a subject matter to be viewed as an evening's entertainment, but as a film showing how horrible a person was without the meat.",2,"&quot;Hi, I'm Ted....&quot;",1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,3642,"['Serial', 'killers', 'actions', 'motivations', 'can', 'be', 'incredibly', 'intriguing', 'mind', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'what', 'people', 'heads', 'what', 'point', 'killing', 'people', 'One', 'worst', 'not', 'probably', 'worst', 'mass', 'serial', 'killer', 'time', 'America', 'history', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'Just', 'name', 'alone', 'can', 'send', 'chills', 'bring', 'up', 'horrible', 'stories', 'years', 'past', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'simply', 'lost', 'knowledge', 'years', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'murdered', 'least', '28', 'women', 'say', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'more', '1974', '1978', 'Most', 'crimes', 'were', 'commited', 'areas', 'Oregon', 'Colorado', 'Utah', 'Florida', 'here', 'Washington', 'One', 'girl', 'grave', 'here', 'just', 'found', 'other', 'day', 'movie', 'also', 'deals', 'Ted', 'escape', 'prison', 'soon', 'be', 'recapture', 'portrayed', 'here', 'Michael', 'Reilly', 'Burke', 'other', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'Mark', 'Harmon', '1986', 'quot', 'Deliberate', 'Stranger', 'quot', 'Burke', 'character', 'hour', 'half', 'are', 'watching', 'found', 'believe', 'guy', 'able', 'do', 'things', 'film', 'best', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'film', 'Burke', 'opening', 'scene', 'mirror', 'was', 'downright', 'creepy', 'subsequent', 'quot', 'quot', 'are', 'blood', 'chilling', 'sick', 'Burke', 'right', 'handsome', 'looks', 'sweet', 'charm', 'made', 'Bundy', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'women', 'did', 'ah', 'schucks', 'cool', 'presence', 'swiftly', 'turn', 'deadly', 'sadistic', 'Burke', 'really', 'guy', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'turn', 'raging', 'loony', 'problem', 'film', 'how', 'be', 'more', 'Afterschool', 'Special', 'version', 'Bundy', 'legacy', 'real', 'docu', 'type', 'film', 'up', 'dirt', 'everyone', 'guy', 'psyche', 'Not', 'easily', 'watchable', 'are', 'hardcore', 'moments', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'brutalness', 'meant', 'opnly', 'scratch', 'surface', 'man', 'instead', 'going', 'deeper', 'who', 'was', 'where', 'came', 'mentioning', 'mixed', 'up', 'family', 'upbringing', 'was', 'something', 'fully', 'explore', 'movie', 'never', 'there', 'one', 'gruesome', 'scene', 'next', 'even', 'realistically', 'shot', 'Burke', 'off', 'whole', 'project', 'story', 'off', 'feeling', 'bit', 'hollow', 'empty', 'felt', 'cliff', 'notes', 'version', 'real', 'story', 'quot', 'Deliberate', 'Stranger', 'quot', 'was', '4', 'hours', 'one', '90', 'minutes', 'when', 'credits', 'start', 'roll', ""n't"", 'much', 'cast', 'Botti', 'Ann', 'Bliss', 'girlfriend', ""'70"", 'pleasant', 'look', 'many', 'scenes', 'feature', 'how', 'lacking', 'acting', 'department', 'most', 'interesting', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'real', 'pictures', 'real', 'film', 'news', 'Ted', 'eventual', 'execution', '1989', 'are', 'shown', 'was', 'fantastic', 'touch', 'put', 'film', 'moments', 'leading', 'Ted', 'ultimate', 'death', 'electric', 'chair', 'are', 'shown', 'given', 'audience', 'first', 'time', 'look', 'what', 'beforehand', 'was', 'first', 'moments', 'swelling', 'music', 'background', 'Ted', 'breaking', 'down', 'make', 'seem', 'was', 'wronged', 'man', 'should', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'way', 'felt', 'when', 'scene', 'was', 'playing', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'all', 'bad', 'could', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'not', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'be', 'viewed', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'film', 'showing', 'how', 'horrible', 'person', 'was', 'meat']",Ted Bundy
715879,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00006HAWV,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[0, 0]","Michael Reilly Burke gives a terrifyingly believable performance as Ted Bundy- termed the first &quot;serial killer&quot; by FBI profilers. Directed &amp; Co-Written by Matthew Bright with Stephen Johnston; the movie traces Bundy's reign of terror from 1974 in Seattle. Ironically, an ex law/psychology student &amp; volunteer for a teen crisis helpline, Bundy was born illegitimate &amp; grew up believing his mother was actually his sister.Ted's road to crime starts off with petty theft before graduating to being a Peeping Ted before he takes his obsessions one step further; soon feeding his interest in BDSM, &amp; committing muggings which soon escalate to murders, rapes &amp; necrophilia (amazingly which NZs censors left in). The gruesome FX are by none other than Tom Savini who also appears in the movie as a cop.Bundy also drives the now stereotypical serial killer car- a yellow VW Beetle, which he uses to abduct &amp; murder college girls, usually by asking for assistance while wearing a sling. Somehow Bundy is able to charm the ladies even though in his blazer &amp; red bow tie he looks like the King Of The Dweebs.Unlike Dahmer or Gein, Bundy knew what he was doing was wrong. He just doesn't care. But wait a minute: David Lane &amp; his band of outdated fogeys would have us believe it's movies like THIS that are directly to blame for creating people like Ted Bundy!The violence in the movie is very graphic and disturbing. But is real life violence subtle? Or entertaining? That's another one of the SPCS's problems: they seem to think all films are for *entertainment*. How many Kiwi familes would sit down in front of the box on a cold winters night with a bowl of popcorn &amp; watch ONCE WERE WARRIORS (RP16 in NZ) together purely for *ENTERTAINMENT*?  Personally, when I have kids I'd prefer they watched NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (also RP16) over WARRIORS. (By kids I mean age 13+. I don't want to be misinterpreted as irresponsible).In spite of the gore, this film doesn't glamorise Bundy &amp; try to turn him into an anti-hero; though admittedly the film makers didn't take into account the feelings of the victim's familes; which may be a springboard for some to criticise or condemn the picture. That said, it's strangely gratifying at the end watching the scumbag get his comeuppance.Now, you'll notice that I haven't really been mentioning Burke in my review: that's because when you watch this- he really DOES become Ted Bundy for the duration of the film. Burke would almost certainly have gotten an Oscar nomination if the Academy weren't so egotistical, selective &amp; yes, wimpy.TED BUNDY is an excellent movie, certainly not recommended for the faint-hearted; but for people with an interest in serial killers this is a must-see. Just don't watch it straight after dinner.",4,A chilling exploration/exploitation of  a diseased mind.,1065830400,"10 11, 2003",2003,2815,"['Michael', 'Reilly', 'Burke', 'terrifyingly', 'believable', 'performance', 'Ted', 'Bundy-', 'termed', 'first', 'quot', 'serial', 'killer', 'quot', 'FBI', 'profilers', 'Directed', 'amp', 'Co-Written', 'Matthew', 'Bright', 'Stephen', 'Johnston', 'movie', 'Bundy', 'reign', 'terror', '1974', 'Seattle', 'Ironically', 'ex', 'law/psychology', 'student', 'amp', 'volunteer', 'teen', 'crisis', 'helpline', 'Bundy', 'was', 'born', 'illegitimate', 'amp', 'grew', 'up', 'believing', 'mother', 'was', 'actually', 'sister.Ted', 'road', 'crime', 'starts', 'petty', 'theft', 'graduating', 'being', 'Peeping', 'Ted', 'obsessions', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'soon', 'feeding', 'interest', 'BDSM', 'amp', 'committing', 'muggings', 'soon', 'escalate', 'murders', 'rapes', 'amp', 'amazingly', 'NZs', 'censors', 'left', 'gruesome', 'FX', 'are', 'none', 'other', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'who', 'also', 'movie', 'cop.Bundy', 'also', 'now', 'stereotypical', 'serial', 'killer', 'car-', 'yellow', 'VW', 'Beetle', 'abduct', 'amp', 'murder', 'college', 'girls', 'usually', 'asking', 'assistance', 'wearing', 'sling', 'Somehow', 'Bundy', 'able', 'charm', 'ladies', 'even', 'blazer', 'amp', 'red', 'bow', 'tie', 'King', 'Dweebs.Unlike', 'Dahmer', 'Gein', 'Bundy', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'wrong', 'just', ""n't"", 'care', 'wait', 'minute', 'David', 'Lane', 'amp', 'band', 'outdated', 'fogeys', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'movies', 'THIS', 'are', 'directly', 'blame', 'creating', 'people', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'violence', 'movie', 'very', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'real', 'life', 'violence', 'subtle', 'entertaining', 'one', 'SPCS', 'problems', 'seem', 'think', 'films', 'are', '*entertainment*', 'How', 'many', 'Kiwi', 'familes', 'would', 'sit', 'down', 'front', 'box', 'cold', 'winters', 'night', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'amp', 'watch', 'WERE', 'WARRIORS', 'RP16', 'NZ', 'together', 'purely', '*ENTERTAINMENT*', 'Personally', 'when', 'have', 'kids', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'watched', 'NIGHTMARE', 'ON', 'ELM', 'STREET', 'also', 'RP16', 'WARRIORS', 'kids', 'mean', 'age', '13+', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'misinterpreted', 'irresponsible', '.In', 'spite', 'gore', 'film', ""n't"", 'glamorise', 'Bundy', 'amp', 'try', 'turn', 'anti-hero', 'admittedly', 'film', 'makers', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'account', 'feelings', 'victim', 'familes', 'may', 'be', 'springboard', 'criticise', 'condemn', 'picture', 'said', 'strangely', 'gratifying', 'end', 'watching', 'scumbag', 'get', 'comeuppance.Now', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'been', 'mentioning', 'Burke', 'review', 'because', 'when', 'watch', 'this-', 'really', 'become', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'duration', 'film', 'Burke', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'have', 'gotten', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Academy', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'egotistical', 'selective', 'amp', 'yes', 'wimpy.TED', 'BUNDY', 'excellent', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'recommended', 'faint-hearted', 'people', 'interest', 'serial', 'killers', 'must-see', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'straight', 'dinner']",Ted Bundy
715880,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00006HAWV,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","I honestly had no idea who Ted Bundy was until I watched this movie tonight. I mean, I knew he was some guy who killed a bunch of people, but I had no idea he killed... what was it? Over 150 women? Possibly many more that weren't discovered? Man, what a horrible human being.The movie focuses on the detailed ways in which Ted killed his victims.Many of the girls ran around screaming in an attempt to run away from Ted Bundy, many of the women were tricked into getting into the same car with him which resulted in the victims being punched in the face or knocked out completely (with death soon following) and the women who were hitchhiking, well... they didn't have a chance either.There was one woman though, who put up a heck of a fight as soon as she realized what was going on. If there was ever a reason to teach your kids to never EVER get inside a car with a stranger, this movie is it.Furthermore, sometimes Ted would spy on certain women as they walked inside their house, then kill them in their sleep. He had many ways to carry out his brutal killing spree. He apparently traveled all over Utah and Colorado killing women over and over and over again... somehow either not getting caught, or when he WAS eventually caught, he found ways to escape from prison.The ending of the movie is great though, which I won't spoil. It's graphic. What goes around comes around. The only thing I didn't particularly care for was the very final line of the movie which Bundy's ex-girlfriend delivered. It was just a cheesy way to end the movie I think. Other than that, the movie basically focuses on Ted Bundy meeting up with women and killing them.

715881,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00006HAWV,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","I watched ""The Deliberate Stranger"" a long time ago, with Mark Harmon, and I found his interpretation of Bundy to be mostly caricature.  I just read the book ""The Stranger Beside Me"" by Ann Rule, and so I figured that I would give this film a peek.  I wasn't disappointed.One thing that I liked about this film:  they didn't feel the need to sugarcoat almost anything.  They showed behaviors from Bundy's character that most likely were guessed to be true (even behind bars, Bundy wouldn't talk about ""personal"" things, so his fetishes were not completely known); and more importantly, those behaviors were most likely true based upon reading between the lines of Bundy's life.  From my experience watching film - in the United States at least - the majority of directors just wouldn't have the guts - or the power - to go in some of these directions.  Kudos to the actor, writer and director in that regard for having the courage to do this.In Ms. Rule's book, I believe that she at least implied that the justice system in Florida was to some degree ""back woods,"" or not completely progressive in thought, mostly as they didn't have a problem with the death penalty.  I found that troublesome.  Here, the director also did not make that common mistake; all of the people in Florida's justice department were treated fairly in this portrayal.  Good call.Has there ever been a ""perfect"" film about Bundy?  Surely not.

I think the director wasn't going for that but the TB actor did it so good that it was hard not to feel that way..it was kind of weird to sympatize for a maniac like that but that's what made the movie great, it played with your emotions.Reading all these reviews i realized that everyone's got there own opinion of this movie but the average was 3 stars so you should give it shot, even better for you if you've never heard of Ted Bundy, it'll show you that even if someone is so likeable, cool and charming, there's still that monster within..and in this case a murderer.Check it out!",5,Too many reviews...who to listen to?,1074124800,"01 15, 2004",2004,1148,"['quot', 'TED', 'BUNDY', 'quot', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'accurateprotrayal', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'serial', 'killers', 'generation', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'parts', 'were', 'fiction', 'sleeping', 'corpes', 'movie', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'idiot', 'when', 'certainly', 'was', 'not', '100', 'women', 'never', 'getting', 'caught', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'TB', 'was', 'excellent', 'really', 'went', 'deep', 'character', 'even', 'sick', 'say..you', 'kind', 'felt', 'bad', 'end', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'was', 'time', 'execution', 'think', 'director', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'TB', 'actor', 'did', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'way..it', 'was', 'kind', 'weird', 'sympatize', 'maniac', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'great', 'played', 'emotions.Reading', 'reviews', 'i', 'realized', 'everyone', 'got', 'there', 'own', 'opinion', 'movie', 'average', 'was', '3', 'stars', 'so', 'should', 'give', 'shot', 'even', 'better', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Ted', 'Bundy', ""'ll"", 'show', 'even', 'someone', 'so', 'likeable', 'cool', 'charming', 'still', 'monster', 'within..and', 'case', 'murderer.Check', 'out']",Ted Bundy

This film is about the real life serial killer Ted Bundy who terrorized many a young lady in his time and still became a celebrity. That of course was towards the end of his life on this earth, it is shocking how he raped and killed women yet so many of them loved him while he was in jail for the last time before his execution.This film superbly written by Stephen Johnston and director Matthew Bright is what every based on true events movie should be, a straight forward in your face picture. This film is not preachy in any way, and doesn't take any side nor does it heroinize [not sure that is even a word] the film's killer Bundy. This film does not show any sympathy to the killer at all, for some reason some films like to make you feel bad for the killer by showing him/her as a person with problems, mental most of the time, some like to use a bad childhood as an excuse for a killer. Instead this film just shows you what happened, like it or not this man existed and really committed these crimes.Bundy is played masterfully by Michael Reilly Burke, when viewing this film the first I had no doubt in my mind that I was really seeing Ted Bundy on my screen. He really plays the part perfectly, he is very creepy in one scene and wholesome and charming in the next. Matthew Bright did an excellent job as the director for this film, his direction is suburb and you can tell he really wanted to make the best movie possible. Of course you all know the story; Bundy brutally killed then raped [in that order] various women for years. He was even caught a couple of times and escaped from prison only to start doing it all again. The weird thing about it was that he actually had a girlfriend that would anything for him, that includes playing dead while they had sex [creepy]. The girlfriend was played masterfully by Boti Ann Bliss, her performance was outstanding and I can see why she was cast.Now comes the real messed up part, when he was in jail the last time before his execution he received hundreds of fan letters from WOMEN every where. Speaking of his execution, Burke's performance is painfully good during the scenes were he is being prepped for the chair, and I mean painfully. It is the one scene that made me feel for the guy, I could really see the fear in his eyes, and his screams had me cringing.

There is also a cartoonish scene of two Sorority girls jumping on their beds having a pillow fight.

Multiple times I thought it would end but it never seems to know when the story is over; as if there was a story.Where the film ultimately fails is in it's portrayal of Ted Bundy. It's not accurate at all. What we have here is a movie about a guy who acts like a complete idiot and kills a bunch of women while calling them obscene names and doing bizarre things. Sure, you could maybe ""sum up"" Bundy as a bizarre guy that killed women but he was also a brilliant up and coming lawyer with a son. None of the person he actually was is touched on.

715894,A1YIWDKM1292L4,B00006HAWV,"jenbird ""book and classic movie fiend""","[67, 70]","...well, you're still going to be waiting.As in ""The Deliberate Stranger,"" the details of Bundy's crimes and victims are shuffled around (although this movie is more true to life as far as plain facts go) and very few real names are used. For example, Bundy is seen kidnapping his last victim, ""Suzanne,"" but then footage from the actual press conference after his execution is shown, and is it said he was executed for the murder of Kimberly Diane Leach (her real name). It can be confusing for a viewer familiar with the facts of the case; I spent chunks of time trying to keep straight in my head which character represented which victim.There are other small film clips of the real Bundy, which really make you sit up and pay attention. I thought they were a good addition to the film; to me, it reminds viewers that this is not just a story, it actually happened.Disappointingly, the movie puts much of its focus on Bundy's relationship with ""Lee,"" the model for Elizabeth Kendall (who later wrote ""The Phantom Prince""), and virtually ignores his friendship with true crime writer Ann Rule (who was writing stories about the missing girls during the time Ted was killing them) and marriage to Carole Ann Boone, who later gave birth to his daughter.The movie seems to draw on Robert Keppel's ""Riverman: Ted Bundy & I Hunt the Green River Killer,"" which included gory details of Bundy's last minute confessions to Keppel. Some details are recreated for the movie, with very disturbing images. Hopefully, that would be a sure-fire cure for the ""over 200 women"" who wrote Ted while he was on Death Row to tell him they loved him (a fact mentioned at the end of this movie).Another reviewer mentioned that the execution scenes were a protest against the death penalty. I disagree; by the end of the movie, after watching Bundy commit henious crimes in full, Technicolor detail, you don't much care what happens to him, and if he suffered, it's only a fraction of what his many victims suffered.I could have done without the collection of ""I'm Ted Bundy!"" children in the final scene. I get the point: even your average, clean-cut person, as Ted seemed to be, can be a monster. Bundy himself said serial killers are husbands, brothers, sons, etc. I just think there was another way that point could have been made, and I found the children distracting from the story as a whole. However, if the film makers went for shock value with that scene, they certainly succeeded.All in all, the movie is worth a watch (if the disturbing images and graphic violence don't bother you) if you're interested in Bundy's story but already aware of the facts. For the casual viewer, or someone wanting to learn more about Bundy, not so much.POSTSCRIPT: A few days after this review was posted, I received a long, rambling, rather disturbing email from someone claiming to be Matthew Bright, the director of this film. One can only hope it was an impostor, and that the real Matthew Bright has better things to do than email people who give negative reviews to his movie (and I am not by far the only one; check out Rottentomatoes.com for more).Bright claimed that Carole Ann Boone was not worthy of inclusion in his movie (one of my criticisms) because ""her relationship with Bundy was based on lies."" I highly doubt that Bundy's relationship with Liz Kendall, explored at length in the movie, was based on total honesty. By Kendall's own admission in ""The Phantom Prince: My Life With Ted Bundy,"" she was lied to from the very beginning. So that takes care of that argument.Bright went on to say that Ann Rule was also not worthy of mention in his film because she was just an ""ordinary person"" who was fooled by Bundy. Well, that's the point; she was also an ordinary person who happened to be a close friend of Bundy's for many years, and corresponded with him while in prison. This argument negates his later claim that Bundy was not as normal as he seemed. Obviously not, but he did manage to fool a lot of people for a very long time, as documented in other sources, both print and other media (notably A&E;'s Biography of Bundy).Personally, I don't care whether Bright likes or respects Boone and Rule or not. The fact remains, they were both major figures in Bundy's life, and as such must be included in any film hoping to tell Bundy's story in an accurate manner.Which brings me back to my main gripe about the film in the first place: it's not accurate. Other than that, someone who actually reads my review closely will note that I found several things that impressed me about the film: news clips of the real Bundy, the mention of women who wrote to Bundy on Death Row, and the shock value of the scene with the children at the end.The fact that the director (or someone claiming to be the director) got so very defensive about the film due to a review that isn't really all that negative, should tell you something right there.",3,Waiting for an accurate Bundy movie...?,1036886400,"11 10, 2002",2002,4924,"['well', ""'re"", 'still', 'going',

People need to make the movie work. This movie was just...Idiotic. There is a part where Ted approaches a girl who says her name is Suzanne. Then moments later, it seems Ted was convicted for the murder of the girl, only now her name is Kimberly Leach (the real name of his last victim). This movie is simply a way to show you naked women. This would be good if most of them weren't ugly, and covered in blood. I might add as well that there is a scene in the beginning where Bundy is walking around stealing everything in sight. And this becomes comical. Then, a scene where Bundy stands in front of a womans window masturbating. This scene is supposed to be horrifying but then...A man leans out the window on the top floor leans out his window, sees Ted, and says ""Not you again"". This is funny. Pure & simple.

715901,A2E43JUCG5WGVZ,B00006HAWV,Kelly,"[0, 0]","First off, I was surprised by reviews that said this was gory until I noticed the date of 2003 on those reviews.  In my opinion, even by the standards of a decade ago this is not gory when you compare it to the Friday the 13th or Halloween movies of that year.  Don't get me wrong-there are some sick scenes but it's to be expected in a movie about Ted Bundy.  This movie is not revealing into the mind of this monster or how he became the brutal killer he was. There is no in depth look at his personality at all though you already know he's crazy. It basically touches the surface of his crimes while leaving a lot about his life out.  If you are already a true crime fan (as I am) and already know of his crimes-this movie won't reveal anything more and may annoy you that so much is left out.  But if you barely know anything about Ted Bundy then this movie is pretty good because you get the idea that he was a killer with sadistic pleasures who seemed compelled to kill as many as he could while enjoying his victims terror.  I agree with another reviewer that the killings all blend together with no real focus on any of the victims.  It's almost as if they just scraped the surface of everything about his existence even by just mentioning periods in his life so they can say they included it in the film.  I did get a little bored with all the scenes with his girlfriend/doormat but didn't skip ahead for fear I'd miss something good.  I didn't other than that he was a liar which is a trait of all serial killers since they are lying to the world.  I found that the main character came off more dorky than the charismatic character that Bundy was.  Not horrible but I'm not picky and was glad it wasn't gory since ironically, I have a weak stomach for the gore while being an avid true crime fan.  I think the scariest thing about the movie is that it's based (loosely) on a real person and that these freaks are really out there hunting their next victim while seeming normal to everyone around them.

Another movie about Bundy starring Mark Harmon didn't provide the level of violence and depravity that are shown in this version. Bundy was a charmer who looked clean cut and trustworthy, so it is easy to understand how he managed to elude capture for so long. Like most sociopaths, he was highly intelligent. This movie provides a glimpse into so many aspects of him including the charm, intelligence, skill at manipulation, and the darker side of him that harbored so much pent up anger and violence toward women.Viewing this movie was deeply disturbing due to the graphic nature of it, but the graphic nature of the film was necessary in order to really get into the twisted and evil mind of Bundy. It left me with a firm conviction that one should never trust anyone, regardless of how innocent they may appear. Many who knew Bundy had no idea of the evil that lurked beneath the mask of a clean cut and intelligent law student. One thing I could not understand was how his girlfriend could have failed to recognize the dark side of Ted Bundy based on what was portrayed in this movie since he wanted her to engage in some bizarre sexual practices.Although this movie is deeply disturbing, it is one that provides an eerie look into the mind of one of the most notorious killers in the history of the United States. I was left with a chilling reminder that you never really know the darker side of human nature sometimes until it is too late. I would have rated it 5 stars if it had not contained so much vulgar language, but in all honesty I think it was necessary to truly portray the perverted side of Ted Bundy.",4,Absolutely chilling!,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,1756,"['movie', 'really', 'intense', 'far', 'more', 'graphic', 'portrait', 'Bundy', 'perverted', 'sociopath', 'dark', 'violent', 'fantasies', 'movie', 'Bundy', 'starring', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'level', 'violence', 'depravity', 'are', 'shown', 'version', 'Bundy', 'was', 'charmer', 'who', 'looked', 'clean', 'cut', 'trustworthy', 'easy', 'understand', 'how', 'managed', 'elude', 'capture', 'so', 'long', 'most', 'sociopaths', 'was', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'glimpse', 'so', 'many', 'aspects', 'including', 'charm', 'intelligence', 'skill', 'manipulation', 'darker', 'side', 'harbored', 'so', 'much', 'pent', 'up', 'anger', 'violence', 'women.Viewing', 'movie', 'was', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'due', 'graphic', 'nature', 'graphic', 'nature', 'film', 'was', 'necessary', 'order', 'really', 'get', 'twisted', 'evil', 'mind', 'Bundy', 'left', 'firm', 'conviction', 'one', 'should', 'never', 'trust', 'anyone', 'regardless', 'how', 'innocent', 'may', 'appear', 'Many', 'who', 'knew', 'Bundy', 'had', 'idea', 'evil', 'lurked', 'mask', 'clean', 'cut', 'intelligent', 'law', 'student', 'One', 'thing', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'was', 'how', 'girlfriend', 'could', 'have', 'failed', 'recognize', 'dark', 'side', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'based', 'what', 'was', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'wanted', 'engage', 'bizarre', 'sexual', 'movie', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'one', 'eerie', 'look', 'mind', 'one', 'most', 'notorious', 'killers', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'left', 'chilling', 'reminder', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'sometimes', 'too', 'late', 'would', 'have', 'rated', '5', 'stars', 'had', 'not', 'contained', 'so', 'much', 'vulgar', 'language', 'honesty', 'think', 'was', 'necessary', 'truly', 'portray', 'perverted', 'side', 'Ted', 'Bundy']",Ted Bundy

Damiano ""UrbanJournalist@aol.com""","[3, 5]","First I have to say you have to view this film as a different take than the pre 1986 film The Deliberate Stranger (Mark Harmon). Bright took a totally opposite approach to the complex interestingly sick mind of Theodore Bundy. The film is majority black humor in a demented way. Bright displayed Bundy's deviant side mostly throughout. As where Deliberate Stranger focused more on Bundy's intelligence, charm & charisma. It showed more of Ted's uncontrollable ego and god complex and manipulation dove more into the facts of his story. Bright's version in an accurate way displayed Ted's falling apart perverse, neurotic, obsessive, out of control impulsive deviant side. This movie is quite perversely violent. There are scenes in which Ted has acts of necrophilia and takes home the body parts of women & puts lipstick on them which is inaccurate of the true accounts of his life but simply added for shock  entertainment value.  The point of the children at the end  saying ""I'm Ted Bundy"" really illustrates the decieving normality that Ted led people to believe. He was the it could be anybody mentality. He had good looks very articulate charming and endearing on the surface but inside was the real Ted Bundy the ego driven self doubting self centered sociopath. Ironically Ted had the ability to pick up any woman he wanted but it simply wasn't enough. The scary part about this movie & his life is one will never know the demons that drove Ted and the hatred of women that consumed his life to the bitter end.

This movie about Ted Bundy is bound to get a cult following. Only twenty minutes into the film and Ted has killed several women, masturbated in public, tortured his girlfriend and is playing with mummified corpses. If this is your sort of thing, then Ted Bundy will deliver on all counts.This is a shocking film and the cruelty that Ted inflicts on his female victims defies belief. Ted Bundy is played exceptionally well by Michael Reilly Burke in a deadpan manipulative way when he is acting normal with his girlfriend and others, but when he is out killing (which comprises about 95% of this movie) his character opens up in leaps and bounds with lashing of black humor. Check out the scene where he tries to explain the ""rape gear"" during an interrogation with a detective or how he plays a cop to get a woman into his killing vehicle of choice (a bright yellow Volkswagen Beetle) at the shopping mall.Bundy is one dominating and controlling character and the film does disturb and is extremely sexually graphic in nature. Instead of delving too much into Bundys background, the investigation or his psychology, the director goes for straight out exploitation. So how does it pan out? The truth is that this film does nothing to honor Bundys victims, treats women very badly (except for the twist ending) and IS exploitation through and through. It is often funny and hilarious in a black sort of way. Is it morally right? NO! Is it political correct? NO! Does this film have a message? NO!........... but it sure as a hell is a ton of fun in a ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" sort of way.

Though it is pretty much a semi- low budget film it was surprisingly better than I had expected it to be. The film plays in a very strange manner. It never really goes into the territory of some sort of fantasy style of film making but there is an essence of fantasy to it. I admit to not knowing much about the history of Bundy and maybe that helped me appreciate this film more than it probably deserves. If the facts are fairly accurate then I would have to say that this film does a pretty great job at presenting the story. If the events are fairly accurate then I would say that Bundy was indeed a much more discusting human being than I first imagined. The murders in this film are pretty disturbing to say the least. Michael Burke brilliantly creates this real life serial killer in two completely different entities. In sort of a Jeckel and Hyde manner. One is a well mannered, thoughtful, brilliant, and seemingly totally normal human being. The dark side of this person is completely sadistic, sick and truly horrific. Burke deserves credit for perfectly displaying both characteristics to a T. His acting is incredibly good considering that he had to play two completely polar opposite personalities throughout the film. The latter portion of the film from the period of his final incarceration and his execution at least seems very frank, unflattering and realistic. Burke then plays Bundy in a third personality- confused, childlike, and terrified. It is truly difficult for an actor to play all three of these to such respectable perfection in the course of a single film. His performance is truly noteworthy.

It really seems to enjoy its subject's depravity - - was it really necessary to show Bundy playing with the head of a victim in his apartment?  The film did very little to show Bundy's relationships with friends and family (his living victims, in a sense).  The real Bundy allegedly had a troubled relationship with his mother and his stepfather, a subject that was never touched on.  The character of Lee, Bundy's longstanding and suffering girlfriend (based on Bundy's real life girlfriend Liz Kendall) comes across as a needy, whiny character who agrees to go along with ""playing dead"" while having sex with her erratic and volatile boyfriend.  Ugh.  Were we supposed to feel sympathy for Lee?  Or perhaps for Bundy, who always saw himself as a victim?Michael Reilly Burke does a good job playing Bundy as the degenerate he truly was.  While Mark Harmon played Bundy as a suave, charismatic ""gentleman"" in ""The Deliberate Stranger"", Burke hits closer to the truth in his dark portrayal.That being said, even with Burke's chilling performance, the victims seem to get lost in the shuffle.  While it is true that Bundy had a large amount of victims, the true number of which has never been known, and certain composites and consolidation must be done for theatrical purposes, playing the old classic ""Rescue Me"" imposed over images of Bundy bludgeoning various victims, kidnapping various victims, or playing with their dead bodies is vile.  To Bundy, the victims were obviously playthings but to continue to perpetrate that myth years later is disrespectful to the victims themselves and their families.To better know about Bundy and his killing spree, ""The Deliberate Stranger"" is a much better choice.

I really enjoyed this movie for giving us an insight of the 30 plus murders Ted Bundy committed in the 1970's. Although it has been said that Bundy might have killed as many as over 100 women. Ted's killing spree spanned over 5 years with many young pretty women his victims. Michael Reilly Burke, in my opinion, gives a very good performance as Bundy. We all know the older movie, The Deleborate Stranger starring Mark Harmon. Though a good movie, I think this movie provides us more insight into the mind and actions of Ted Bundy. Being good looking, charismatic and very smart, it wasn't a problem for Ted to lure his unsuspecting victims into his yellow Volkswagon Bug. In addition to being a murderer, we see that Ted was also a thief who enjoyed stealing. We see that Ted was arrested twice and managed to escape from custody twice. We see him escape through a library window when he should have been supervised and in reality, Ted was able to actually escape from a jail cell. The real story is that Ted lost alot of weight in jail so that he was able to fit into a duct system through the ceiling of his jail cell and managed to escape. He was eventually caught after stealing a van. This time, there was no more escaping for Ted. This movie shows us his typical MO of luring women and usually hitting them in the head rendering them helpless and then eventually raping them and strangling them. It is said that he did decapitate some of his victims, making him seem more like Jeffery Dahmer. If anyone is interested in learning the story of Bundy, I suggest to anyone to at least rent this movie. I own it and I'm not disappointed that I bought it. Also, if you would like to see a interview with the real Bundy, he is featured on.....Serial Killers the 3 DVD set. But back to this movie, I must say that the only part of this movie that bothered me was the ending when they are preparing Ted for his execution by electric chair. I know many many lives were lost due to his actions but it was really bothersome to see them preparing him for the electric chair.... shaving his head, stuffing his rear end, putting a diaper on him, etc. This film actually shows the execution ( of the actor, not the real Bundy). According to this movie, his final words were "" Tell my family I love them"". Then he was hooded and after a ""flick of the switch"", it was all over within 2 minutes. As a horror and gore fan, this part still bothered me as we see blood pouring from his eyes while he is being executed. I am not for or against capitol punishment but I think lethal injection should have been the method of execution and not ""old sparky"". This movie makes you really wonder what goes wrong in Ted's mind making him turn into a cold blooded killer. It truly is sad, not only for him but for the victims. If only he could have gotten help ( if help would have worked), then his life and the lives of many others could have been spared. Overall, good movie to own and/or rent.",4,A Riveting Account Of Ted Bundy.....,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,3099,"['Theodore', 'Robert', 'Bundy', 'known', 'simply', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'ladykiller', 'was', 'doubt', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'famous', 'serial', 'killers', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'giving', 'insight', '30', 'murders', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'committed', '1970', 'been', 'said', 'Bundy', 'might', 'have', 'killed', 'as', 'many', '100', 'women', 'Ted', 'killing', 'spree', 'spanned', '5', 'years', 'many', 'young', 'pretty', 'women', 'victims', 'Michael', 'Reilly', 'Burke', 'opinion', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'Bundy', 'know', 'older', 'movie', 'Deleborate', 'Stranger', 'starring', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'good', 'movie', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'insight', 'mind', 'actions', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'Being', 'good', 'looking', 'charismatic', 'very', 'smart', 'was', ""n't"", 'problem', 'Ted', 'lure', 'unsuspecting', 'victims', 'yellow', 'Volkswagon', 'Bug', 'addition', 'being', 'murderer', 'see', 'Ted', 'was', 'also', 'thief', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'stealing', 'see', 'Ted', 'was', 'arrested', 'twice', 'managed', 'escape', 'custody', 'twice', 'see', 'escape', 'library', 'window', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'supervised', 'reality', 'Ted', 'was', 'able', 'actually', 'escape', 'jail', 'cell', 'real', 'story', 'Ted', 'lost', 'alot', 'weight', 'jail', 'so', 'was', 'able', 'fit', 'duct', 'system', 'ceiling', 'jail', 'cell', 'managed', 'escape', 'was', 'eventually', 'caught', 'stealing', 'van', 'time', 'was', 'more', 'escaping', 'Ted', 'movie', 'typical', 'MO', 'luring', 'women', 'usually', 'hitting', 'head', 'rendering', 'helpless', 'then', 'eventually', 'raping', 'strangling', 'said', 'did', 'decapitate', 'victims', 'making', 'seem', 'more', 'Jeffery', 'Dahmer', 'anyone', 'interested', 'learning', 'story', 'Bundy', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'least', 'rent', 'movie', 'own', ""'m"", 'not', 'disappointed', 'bought', 'Also', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'interview', 'real', 'Bundy', 'featured', '..Serial', 'Killers', '3', 'DVD', 'set', 'back', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'bothered', 'was', 'ending', 'when', 'are', 'preparing', 'Ted', 'execution', 'electric', 'chair', 'know', 'many', 'many', 'lives', 'were', 'lost', 'due', 'actions', 'was', 'really', 'bothersome', 'see', 'preparing', 'electric', 'chair', 'shaving', 'head', 'stuffing', 'rear', 'end', 'putting', 'diaper', 'etc', 'film', 'actually', 'execution', 'actor', 'not', 'real', 'Bundy', 'According', 'movie', 'final', 'words', 'were', 'Tell', 'family', 'love', 'Then', 'was', 'hooded', 'flick', 'switch', 'was', '2', 'minutes', 'horror', 'gore', 'fan', 'part', 'still', 'bothered', 'see', 'blood', 'pouring', 'eyes', 'being', 'executed', 'am', 'not', 'capitol', 'punishment', 'think', 'lethal', 'injection', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'method', 'execution', 'not', 'old', 'sparky', 'movie', 'really', 'wonder', 'what', 'wrong', 'Ted', 'mind', 'making', 'turn', 'cold', 'blooded', 'killer', 'truly', 'sad', 'not', 'only', 'victims', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'help', 'help', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'then', 'life', 'lives', 'many', 'others', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spared', 'Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'own', 'and/or', 'rent']",Ted Bundy

I'm surprised in the extreme as to what other reviewers had to say.  I thought the real horror and violence of Bundy's crimes were perfectly captured- far from being titillating, it made me want to vomit.  The sheer brutality of it, the casual way he dumped bodies as if bags of trash, I'm at a loss to see how anyone could describe it as ""exploitation.""  The man was beguiling, intelligent, charming, and a monster.  The version with Mark Harmon, though absorbing, didn't begin to capture the ""reality"", the HORROR of Bundy's crimes.  He may have killed over 100 women.  What would you have instead, an intellectual treatise on serial killing?  I thought the director's intent was to depict the brutality in a NON-gratuitous fashion, and I think he (or she) succeeded admirably.Women were not depicted as sex objects in this film- there were no shots of sexy cleavage or lovely long lashes; women were depicted as human beings who were unlucky enough to encounter Ted Bundy.  The film did a stellar job of showing that the perversion, the view of women being mere faceless objects was in TED.  It was fascinating, compelling from beginning to end.  To my mind, this film almost ranks up there with A Clockwork Orange or Midnight Cowboy in its realistic depiction of violence.I always think of exploitative, gratuitious violence as violence that is arousing, exciting, and I found it to be the antithesis of this.  I thought it was honest, gut-wrenching, horrifying, and very thought-provoking.  We don't yet understand what drives people like Ted Bundy, so there IS no examining what makes them tick, the best we can do is look at the pattern of their behavior as this film does.  For those of you who have seen the Mark Harmon version and not this one I won't give the details away, but the first film tried to paint him as a paradox, a decent person in other aspects of his life and that simply wasn't true.

However it sure as hell is better than Dahmer, but not as good as Ed Gein.Ted Bundy is about, well Ted Bundy, a serial killer/Rapist who ran rampart in the 60's and 70's.  He killed over 35 women in his spree and escaped twice.  The movie tries to reflect on his tale by showing us what he did, to some extnt.  There is no nudity in this outside of a few minutes of him with his girlfriend.  Instead he takes a blunt object and he bashes them on the head/  He them takes them to a remote location where he violates there corpse (someimes they were alive).  After that is all said and done he would go back to living a seemingly normal life.  The movie starts in the beggining of his spree and shows some of the techniques he used (most popular being a cast) and it plays all the way towards his execution.As a movie goes there is reason why this is drect to video.  There is little doubt that this would have been a box office flop.  The movie is very vague at times and focus more on his brutality, than when the time comes for acting only the guy playing Ted seems to do a fairly decent job.  Overall this is a renter, but sure as hell not a keeper.",3,Another pathertic Serial Killer Flick,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,1289,"['Yet', 'string', 'serial', 'killer', 'films', 'seem', 'run', 'rampart', 'direct', 'video', 'market', 'THis', 'movie', 'OK', 'one', 'best', 'However', 'sure', 'hell', 'better', 'Dahmer', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Ed', 'Gein.Ted', 'Bundy', 'about', 'well', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'serial', 'killer/Rapist', 'who', 'ran', 'rampart', '60', '70', 'killed', 'over', '35', 'women', 'spree', 'escaped', 'twice', 'movie', 'reflect', 'tale', 'showing', 'what', 'did', 'extnt', 'nudity', 'outside', 'few', 'minutes', 'girlfriend', 'Instead', 'blunt', 'object', 'head/', 'remote', 'location', 'where', 'there', 'corpse', 'someimes', 'were', 'alive', 'said', 'done', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'living', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'life', 'movie', 'beggining', 'spree', 'techniques', 'used', 'most', 'popular', 'being', 'cast', 'way', 'execution.As', 'movie', 'reason', 'why', 'drect', 'video', 'little', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'box', 'office', 'flop', 'movie', 'very', 'vague', 'times', 'focus', 'more', 'brutality', 'when', 'time', 'acting', 'only', 'guy', 'playing', 'Ted', 'do', 'fairly', 'decent', 'job', 'Overall', 'renter', 'sure', 'hell', 'not', 'keeper']",Ted Bundy
