The presentation presents interesting findings from studies during the past few decades, many of which may not be well-known to the general public and may therefore be eye-opening, so I can recommend it to people new to this topic.However, for people already somewhat familiar with this topic, or who want to go into more depth, this presentation may feel somewhat superficial relative to its length, and so more in the ""edutainment"" category, though I did find some of the case studies to be very interesting, especially those dealing with married couples.To go beyond this presentation, I highly recommend reading some of the excellent books on this topic, such asStumbling on Happinessby Daniel Gilbert himself,The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdomby Jonathan Haidt, andThe Geography of Bliss: One Grump's Search for the Happiest Places in the Worldby Eric Weiner (three of my favorites).Also, Gilbert is doubtful about much of self-help literature, though he acknowledges that some of it is good and useful.
