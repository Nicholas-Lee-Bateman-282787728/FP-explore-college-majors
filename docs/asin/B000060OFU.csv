Gillian Anderson, now slowly leaning away from her usual sceptisism and plowing in confusion between her rigid science and the traumatizing consequences of her abduction takes on Mulder, who spends the first 15 episodes of the show under the belief that the truth he seeked had been nothing but a lie.

These collections of the seasons of The X Files are all fantastic. I am so glad they put them on DVD. I didn't always watch the show when it was on TV, so alot of these episodes are new to me. Quite an addicting, program to say the least! This season is in wide screen giving it more of a theatrical feel, which is good. It is so much more then a series, every episode is always done with such care and skill that they are mini movies. Season 5 includes the ""Unusual Suspects"" which shows us how Mulder met the Lone Gunmen, the Stephen King wrote episode, ""Chinga"", and the hilarious story telling in ""Bad Blood"", just to name a few. This DVD, like with all of the other season DVDs, includes documentaries, behind the scenes, deleted scenes, and a DVD-ROM game. This set also has an enjoyable 45 minute F/X special ""Behind the X Files"". All of these box sets are must haves for the collector. My only complaint is with the packaging. These sets come with a slip cover and the inside of the covers are these cardboard flaps that start getting in the way of the disks when you slide them in and out. I actually had to tape mine up because it started peeling off from the inside. I will always give this show 5 stars because of the quality of programming that it is and that there is a wide range of emotions, thoughts, open mindedness and even humor involved. It definitly breaks any kind of conformity. That is so refreshing with a drama like this.

691565,A3LUZB2YONDGQC,B000060OFU,Arkaan Semere,"[27, 40]","The fifth season continued the epic mythology expanse, and arguably pushed it into oblivion.  The end of the Vancouver era, this season (according to me) is where things got a bit too complex for Chris Carter to handle with 100% success.  It lead into the movie, which brought the show a new and larger audience, but never really got a full grasp on it's success.  That said, there are some incredible episodes that need mentioning, and make this set worth buying.--Redux (I and II): This is my favourite two parter, and one of the best explorations of trust The X-Files has ever attempted.  Everything is remarkable, from Scully's cancer, to the haunting voiceovers.--Post Modern Prometheus: a dazzling slight of hand from Carter and Co.  This modern fairy tale/frankenstein story had one of those moments that fans die for; that wonderful, insipirational, moving ending.--A Chirstmas Carol/Emily:  Not one of the best, but Gillian Anderson's performance is magnificent in this two parter.--Patient X/The Red and the Black: The final two parter of the fifth season, this show is relentlessly entertaining and challenging.--The Pine Bluff Variant: The best 'stand alone' of the fifth season, a well paced and executed suspense show.--The End:  The cliffhanger before the movie.  Very strong conclusion.So what do I mean when I say 'arguably pushed it to oblivion'?  The overall season is very inconsistent, with some very weak episodes, that don't measure up to previous efforts (Bad Blood, Kitsunegari, Kill Switch).  Plus, the sixth season (despite a great lead in), failed to generate as much interest.The third and fourth season, when taken together, display a rare ambition of an epic nature.  The fifth season fails to live up to the standard set, but this is by no means a waste of time.  If you are a fan, then you probably already know if you're going to get this or not.  If not, then I recommend buying the first four seasons first, (or at least the 3rd and fourth).

691571,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B000060OFU,Busy Body,"[5, 5]","Season Five of The X-Files is definitely one of the best seasons from the show's nine-year run, in my opinion. Season Five is where the mythology arc of the show really takes over, resulting in a superb season finale before finally leading to box-office glory in the summer of 1998 with The X-Files Movie: Fight The Future. Season Five was actually filmed after the movie, despite the movie coming out after Season Five! This brilliant season of The X-Files contains a mere 20 episodes - the movie was Chris Carter's excuse as the concluding 'episode/s' to the season. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are on form as their usual best in this season.As previously stated, Season Five is where the mythology arc of the show really takes over. These conspiracy episodes are the best from any season in The X-Files, and made Season 5 more epic than any other. Season Five begins with the great episode Unusual Suspects. In a flash back scene from 1989, the Lone Gunmen meet for the first time and join forces with Mulder to stop a covert government experiment that may be targeted at the American public, after been contacted by a distraught woman. We finally catch up with what happened at the end of Season 4 in the first two-parter of Season Five; ""Redux/Redux II."" Mulder was presumed dead at the end of the previous season, yet the agents play the game better and are one step ahead of everyone else - I won't spoil it for you, but it's truly an amazing two-parter, definitely one of the best in the show's history. The next two-parter we receive from Season Five is ""Christmas Carol"" and ""Emily."" In the former, a mysterious phone call leads Scully to investigate a woman's suicide and a young girl who may be the daughter of her deceased sister, Melissa. In the latter, Scully attempts to adopt three year old Emily Sim, only to discover that the girl has developed a disturbing illness that may be the by-product of a sinister conspiracy.The next in a long list of Season Five two-parters is ""Patient X"" and ""The Red And The Black."" In the former - after a group of alien abductees are burned alive by faceless assailants - Mulder and Scully uncover proof that the event is linked to alien colonisation. In the latter, the agents discover more evidence of the planned alien colonisation of earth and set out to preserve what may be humanity's last remaining link to freedom. Since the beginning of Season Five, Mulder's opinions on what he believes have been severely challenged. We see an extremely sceptical Mulder in this two-parter, not willing to believe anything without proof. The fans aren't used to this, so it's just as glad he reverts to his normal self soon. The Season Five finale - ""The End"" - is another absolutely stunning episode in which Mulder and Scully discover a 12-year-old clairvoyant whose life may be in danger due to his gifted ability to solve all the unexplained phenomena in The X-Files. The Cigarette-Smoking Man really gets involved in this finale, arriving back with full force - intent on complicating things more than they could be and, of course, covering up the truth.The stand-alone episodes of Season Five are amongst the best the show has ever produced. While containing some superb ones such as ""Kitsunegari,"" ""Schizogeny,"" ""Kill Switch,"" ""Mind's Eye,"" ""All Souls,"" ""The Pine Bluff Variant"" and ""Folie A Deux,"" it also contains one atrocious one - ""Travelers."" This is just a rubbish episode, which I turned off inbetween the first viewing. One of the best episodes of Season Five is ""Detour."" In the episode, Mulder and Scully are stalked by an ancient legion of lethal beings while out in the woods investigating a boy's claims that he was attacked by an invisible creature. The striking and rich greens of the trees in the forest make this one of the most memorable episodes in The X-Files' history. ""The Post Modern Prometheus"" is a special episode, filmed entirely in black and white. While investigating the appearance of a freakish creature in a rural town, the agents uncover a dangerous genetic experiment that has spun wildly out of control. The comedy scenes (Mulder and Scully suddenly appearing from behind a door-frame to quiz a suspect is hilarious) make for a much-loved episode.""Chinga"" is another one of the season's highlights. Rumours of witchcraft and sorcery surrounding a bizarre murder lead Scully to a little girl and a cursed doll that may be hiding a murderous secret. The episode was co-written by horror story legend Stephen King and contains some truly scary moments - such as the supermarket one. And watch out for the ""I want more cherries!"" scene! ""Bad Blood"" has to be the funniest episode of The X-Files you will ever see. While exploring the deaths of cattle killed by a series of blood extractions, the agents uncover a cult of vampires residing in a small Texas town. Both Mulder and Scully offer their sides of the story on what happened in flashback scenes. At one point, the agents become so annoyed with each other that when Scully explains what location they were at (with that trademark writing appearing at the bottom of the screen), Mulder cuts in and believes Scully to have got the location wrong. The writing at the bottom of the screen then changes to what Mulder believes it to be! Very funny stuff!OVERALL GRADE: 10/10Season Five of The X-Files is one of the best seasons of any TV show I have ever seen. The season contains many different characters such as the Cigarette-Smoking Man, Alex Krycek, the Lone Gunmen, Maria Covarrubias, Diana Fowley and The Bounty Hunter which only add to the season's quality.

Mulder and Sculley are called out to investigate.  We see something strange, there's some quasi-investigative stuff going on.  We're left with more questions than answers as the government dangles the proverbial ""carrot"" in front of Mulder, who's so dumb to believe that the government created the alien menace to cover up some other conspiracy theory.  I honestly expected the creator's of this show to delve into every nut-job theory, and they did quite a bit, but I haveta ask?  Where's Jimmy Hoffa?!  Do they ever find him in this show?

691578,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000060OFU,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","The fifth season of the X-Files is one of those kind of seasons where if there's any moments that aren't as stellar as previous years gets at least a bit excused. Reason is that this was mainly the time when the crew were also working on the X-Files feature film, ""Fight the Future"". As such, certain episodes were either entirely centered on one of the agents, or they appeared in a support kind of way and not actually directly involved with the case. So trying to get a big-budget movie up and going plus a season's worth of episodes can cause some strain but instead of a lackluster season mainly being blamed for bad writing, is this a season that indirectly suffered or is it good while also being a little flawed.Redux: Taking place after the shocking cliffhanger from ""Gethsemane"", Mulder tries to find clues to Scully's illness in a government building. Great opener. 9/10Redux II: Scully's health continues to get worse, a bizarre cure is found, a surprise guest returns and a mole is revealed (intense scene this one). 9.5/10Unusual Suspects: Intriguing but okay episode about the first start of the Lone Gunmen and their introduction to Mulder. 6/10Detour: In the spirit of ""Darkness Falls"", the agents are lost/trapped within the woods by a group of near-invisible creatures. 9.5/10The Post-Modern Prometheus: Quirky, bizarre episode of a demented town with a Cher-loving Frankenstein. 6.5/10Christmas Carol: Scully investigates a case that has her finding a young girl and also revisiting memories of her sister. 9/10Emily: One of their best episodes as Scully tries to find what's wrong with Emily and Mulder tries to find a cure. 10/10Kitsunegari: One of the series' best villains basically gets whipped and becomes a pansy and somebody new is introduced. Disappointing. 5/10Schizogeny: Meh episode in a trio of meh episodes about an abuse sufferer who uses a strange method to get her revenge...and it involves trees. Yeah. 5.5/10Chinga: Written by Stephen King, this possessed doll episode is alright but could've benefited from additional writing. 6/10Kill Switch: Intriguing but almost forgettable episode about a particularly violent A.I. system. 6/10Bad Blood: Along with ""War of the Corpophages"" and ""Humbug"" as one of the funniest comedies in this Rashomon vampire tale. 9.5/10Patient X: Cool mythology episode as a strange alien race is found and Scully is introduced to a fellow abductee. Mulder's shift to super skeptic is jarring to say the least. 8/10The Red and the Black: Another cool one as Scully tries to remember what happened on the bridge at the cliffhanger of ""Patient X"". 8/10Travellers: Slightly forgettable, slightly good episode about an FBI agent in the 1950's investigating a case that involved Mulder's father. 7/10Mind's Eye: Great episode about a blind woman somehow able to see through the eyes of a killer. Awesome performance by Lili Taylor. 9/10All Souls: Another good one that explores Scully's faith, closure from ""Emily"" and girls who are targeted by dark forces. 8/10The Pine Bluff Variant: Good concept but slow episode about Mulder undercover with a terrorist cell in possession of a nasty virus. 6.5/10Folie a Deux: ""madness shared by two"" in French, Mulder is suspected of being delusional when he keeps seeing visions of a creature. 8/10The End: A young boy who was the apparent target of an assassination attempt uncovers a new addition to the mythos, returning characters and new ones and a surprising end to the titular files (sadly spoiled on the menu). 9/10For all the meh and bad episodes that sometimes show up on this season, it's hard not to fault it entirely because of the filming of the film as well as this was the end of the Vancouver era and soon started the Los Angeles era.

691579,AE2KCASMQPMO,B000060OFU,"C. Meja ""CMM""","[12, 13]","The X-Files' fifth season had only twenty episodes... but THEY ARE TWENTY GREAT EPISODES. The Redux two parter is one of the best season openers ever (only surpased by The Blessing Way and Paperclip). The first half of the season deals with two major changes in the characters: Mulder becoming an skeptic after Redux II and Scully's realization of the fact that she has a child as a result of her previous abduction. Then in The Red and the Black, Mulder's sistem of beliefs is restored. In The End, we are left with nothing... one of the most important X-Files record ever (a kid who could have the answers Mulder has been looking for since his work in the x-files began) gets burned along with everything in his office. And then the agents get reassigned. This season also shows one of the cleverest comedic episodes of the series: Bad Blood (Mulder and Scully show their two contradictory versions of an investigation that dealed with vampirism). This episode is just glorious. The standalones are very good with the exception, perhaps, of Schizogeny and Kitsunegari. But this low point of the season is perfectly balanced with the outstanding two parter dealing with Scully's daughter: Christmas Carol and Emily. This season shows the highpoint of the relationship between the Scullies (Dana, her mother Margaret and her brother Bill): we see them during Redux and Christmas Carol. This is my TOP10 for the season:10. The Postmodern Prometheus (this show got a lot of EMMY nods but of course didn't won a single one... this is one of the true classics of the series... Mulder and Scully investigate a town where there is a mutant. The question about whose creation is this turns into whose creation is this town? The Cher songs, the humour, the black and white cinematography and the comic book look make this a very rare, eclectic and fascinating episode).9. Chinga (This episode was written by Chris Carter and Stephen King. It's scary, yet funny. The song the little girl hears over and over is perfect for the episode. I really liked this. It's not over the top, it's not too experimental, but it's nevertheless perfectly written).8. The End (season finale that opens the way for the movie).7. Detour (A lost-in-the-woods kind of episode that deals with team work. It's a perfect average X-Files episode with a little twist into the funny metaphores).6. Folie a Deux (a man thinks his boss is a giant bug that turns people into zombies... clearly, the man is a wacko... is he? Only Mulder can really ask this question. Another perfect Vince Gilligan episode)5. Unusual Suspects (this episode centers on the lone gunmen trio. We see Mr. X for a brief moment in this episode, which is always nice. This one turns to the begining of this team of geeks and is very funny).4. Bad Blood (Vince Gilligan's third in a row in this list).3. Christmas Carol / Emily (We go deeper in Scully's mind and past... her solitude seems to be comforted by the appeareance of a little girl who could be her daughter.

It was less about unexplained supernatural things in general and more surrounding a highly elaborate plot about one possible alien oriented scenerio, and that was probably one of the least probable alien scenerios that anyone could have come up with. Nobody on the X-Files seemed to have been grounded in science enough to note that stars are so far away if any type of alien vessel were to come to Earth ever, it would probably have to be robotic and ""unmanned"", because travel between the stars takes an infinitude of time. Most scientists realize that, and would be less likely to come up with what amounts to a fairly dumb idea. The chemistry between the characters of Mulder and Scully was always good, and I think worth watching. I wish that they would have been a bit more intelligent with their overall view of what constitutes the unexplained/supernatural. There always seemed to be a far fetched but concrete reason for most of the not related to aliens weirdness on the show, and I think the unexplained/supernatural is anything but easily definable. It is also very like the old monster movies to depict aliens as monsters and or evil doers. Big Whatever To Chris Carter. I gave this a three out of five based on the quality of the acting, not on the content of the script. For all we know there could be dozens of alien races within 250 light years of Earth, not just one, which is also what the X-Files says. I thought the show was limiting. No doubt the creators of it saw themselves as visionaries. Good escapism and little else.

I love them both and hope that their acting careers will flourish now that this show has ended.  Given this, I believe their character development within this fifth season was spectacular.  Turning the tables on their personalities....Mulder becomes the ultimate and might I say, bitter skeptic, while Scully makes every attempt to open her eyes to things beyond science.A personal chord was struck with me when she was dying and called her mother to her hospital bed, only to exclaim something to the effect of, ""Why do I wear this cross?!!!  If everything I've done is for science, then why do I continue to wear this around my neck?  I have ignored my own faith and beliefs!""  It seemed to me to be the turning point for her within this season.  Being a new fan (from the DVD releases), I have yet to see her development in the future seasons.  I just pray that she does not become too sappy.  (please note my irony in using the word 'pray')What I love most of all is the interaction between the two characters.  There is a serious side, a sense of comraderie, and a comical banter with a hint of whimsey.  It's amazing, and I love watching these two act together.  A prime example of this is in the episode Bad Blood, where they both describe versions of events....giving little jabs at each other in their own stories.  a brilliant episode.There is one episode I was astounded by...and not in a good way.  Post Modern Prometheus was quite possible the worst piece of fiction ever written for the television screen.  It was absurd and silly, and to culminate the entire episode at a Cher concert had me exclaiming:  ""SHUT ... UP!!!!!"").  I came onto this message board expecting to find the same opinion, only to find the exact opposite.  Perhaps shooting it in black and white was very good, but the storyline was horrendous.  If they were going to make it silly and ridiculous, then I suggest that they should have ended the episode at a drag queen Cher-look-alike contest.  Would have been more fitting.Overall...EXCELLENT season.  I await season 6 with baited breath.  word.",5,"Ok, people.

691592,A169CPBR76SEF1,B000060OFU,Ian K. Hughes,"[194, 206]","Although most diehard fans of THE X FILES are in agreement as to the merits of Season's Three and Four, the 5th year seems to have elicited more of a mixed response. Certainly the season, to which I give an unqualified recommendation, was unique from a number of perspectives.Most crucially, the chronology of the production was different from any of the previous years. The crew went into production of the X FILES MOVIE in the summer of 1997 immediately after finishing Season 4. For this reason Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny were, for the first time, aware in advance of where the show's mythology arc would be leading them. It seems impossible that this foreknowledge would not affect their performances; the sustained dramatic intensity characteristic of Season Four was loosened quite a bit in Season Five.The actors weren't alone in having a tough time adjusting to this odd schedule. The excellent staff writers, having in the two prior years wrung out the most consistently creative scripts in the history of the show, now had their own work looming as their most formidable obstacle! So, from the writing standpoint it is hardly a surprising that Season Five would present a unique challenge. What is remarkable is that apart from a few notable misses ( and one complete bomb ), this year had so many excellent scripts, especially in the ""stand alone"" episodes.In contrast to its immediate predecessor, Season Five's strengths are weighted toward scripts displaying some of the humorous eccentricities of the 3rd year, most evident in Vince Gilligan's three contributions ( a sort of  equivalent to  Darin Morgan's famed triptych from Season 3 ). His ""Bad Blood"" is an absolute tour de force for the actors. The script draws on subtle aspects of the Scully/Mulder personalities and then ""tweaks"" them, presenting their differing recollections of a single case; slightly distorted perspectives from both agents with neither one corresponding exactly to what actually occurred. Gilligan's knack for characterization also shines in his ""Unusual Suspects"", which fleshes out the Lone Gunmen in way that had not heretofore been done. His ""Folie a Deux"" is not quite at the same level but contains some classic X FILES moments.John Shiban's ""Pine Bluff Variant"" is a tightly scripted espionage thriller, one of the finest examples of his writing. David Duchovny seems to revel in the physicality of this episode.Chris Carter's bizarre but touching ""Post Modern Prometheus"" ( filmed in black and white ) is essentially an X FILES fairy tale, owing as much to David Lynch as to the gothic horror novel written by Mary Shelley.""Kill Switch"" was written by the science fiction authors William Gibson and Tom Maddox.  I'm not familiar with their work but the episode, with its blending of computer technology and contemporary ""cyberpunk"" subculture, is very well done. The beautiful oldie ""Twilight Time"", sung by the Platters, is nicely integrated into the framework.Frank Spotnitz' ""Detour"" links with  previous episodes ( ""Darkness Falls"" and ""Quagmire"" ) in its forest setting and environmental theme.  This fun ""monster of the week"" script ( hellishly difficult to film ) has a beautiful scene with Scully and Mulder stranded together in the woods ( mirroring the ""holdout"" scenes in the other ""forest"" episodes ).""Chinga"", credited to Stephen King and Chris Carter,  is easily the weakest episode of the season as well as the worst script I can recall from the first five seasons. Carter obviously had to dress this one up in a way that plays strictly for laughs.As regards the mythology arc, the two season opening episodes ( ""Redux"" / ""Redux II"") were part of the trilogy linking the previous season's cliffhanger and features some flashback sequences similar to Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". This two-part script, while quite good, was the first of many future myth episodes that were somewhat self consciously ""explanatory"" in nature.  A heaviness began to set in, with the episodes from mid season ( ""Patient X""/""The Red and the Black"" )  suffering from increasingly confusing and tangential plot developments. I attribute these problems primarily to the conflicts between the storyline the film would be using, which effectively shut the writer's out of being able to develop the ""A"" material for television.  Additionally, a tinge of ambivalence crept into David Duchovny's performances.In the prior year Scully's bought with cancer set the stage for the more purely dramatic type of storyline seen in the 5th season's introspective two-part episode titled ""Christmas Carol"" / ""Emily"". This script features well-known ""Scully"" themes from prior seasons:  her grief and guilt over her murdered sister, the loss of her ability to conceive, the flowering of a previously dormant religious faith, the emotional bond with Agent Mulder.  As some of the steam went out of the myth-arc storyline in the following years, the longstanding ""Scully"" storyline moved into the foreground and grew into a highly complex melodrama focusing on the two agents interdependence. This approach was not without its aesthetic pitfalls but it seems fitting that the unique Scully/Mulder ""symbiosis"" would dominate THE X FILES in its final seasons.Finally, the concluding episode of the Fifth Season was appropriately named ""The End"", the title reflecting not only the myth arc plotline but also signaling the end of the show's production in Vancouver. The location in British Columbia furnished so much of the shows ambience that it's hard to imagine THE X FILES ever becoming the phenomenon it did without it being filmed there. There are clear signs that point to the Vancouver era ( esp Seasons 3 thru 5 ) as the absolute creative apex of THE X FILES. The location, along with the vital and often cited contributions of the actors/writers/crew, played an important role in lifting the show to the heights of its well-deserved success.",5,the end of the

There are so many Stephen King classic elements in it: the withdrawn and/or autistic child with a fixation on a recording of music that is made to seem eerie by the obsession with it and by its accompanying horror or evil (in this case, ""The Hokey-Pokey""; in ROSE RED, for instance, it was ""A Summer Place"").  And of course, the story is set in Maine, another King trademark.(Just a note for those who might be interested: the music which Scully is listening to in her car, and later while taking a bath at her motel, is the Piano Concertos Opp. 89 and 85 by J.N. Hummel, and the specific recording-- I recognized it immediately because I own it-- is on the Discover Label conducted by Alexander Rahbari, and the pianist is Dana (!) Protopopescu.  [I had always suspected Scully would be a lover of classical music.])The episodes have been said to be quite unueven in quality, but I think it is in a sense more an unevenness of subject matter.  In general I usually prefer the episodes directly in the X-Files ""Mythos""; but some of the incidental, one-off episodes can be among the most memorable, and that is the case with this season as well.  And even lesser X-Files episodes are (to me at least) head and shoulders over so much else produced for TV.One of the most pleasant themes running through this season is one that has been remarked by other reviewers-- the increasing intimacy of the two protagonists.  They are almost, at times, mirror opposites.  They have come, however, to not only respect each other wholly, but to  love each other in a fraternal way-- in fact, they are by this time intimate friends.  One also gets the idea, never explicitly stated, that perhaps they are not (physically at least) each other's ""type""-- but that their care for each other is slowly wearing this ""objection"" (If objection it be) down and that they are gradually drifting into a romantic, rather than platonic, love.... but we will have to wait a long time for the much anticipated kiss!Anyhow, this season (as are all) is highly recommended.",5,Another Great Season with some interesting digressions,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,2555,"['wo', ""n't"", 'belabor', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'completely', 'season', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'controversial', 'just', 'read', 'comments', 'different', 'reviewers', 'regarding', 'Stephen-King', 'coscripted', 'Chinga', 'range', 'one', 'best', 'worst', 'way', 'few', 'comments', 'Chinga', 'venerable', 'line', 'tales', 'Evil', 'Doll', 'genre', 'back', 'classic', 'story', 'Algernon', 'Blackwood', 'Doll', 'memorably', 'dramatized', 'NIGHT', 'GALLERY', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'Stephen', 'King', 'classic', 'elements', 'withdrawn', 'autistic', 'child', 'fixation', 'recording', 'music', 'made', 'seem', 'eerie', 'obsession', 'accompanying', 'horror', 'evil', 'case', 'Hokey-Pokey', 'ROSE', 'RED', 'instance', 'was', 'A', 'Summer', 'Place', 'course', 'story', 'set', 'Maine', 'King', 'trademark', 'note', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'music', 'Scully', 'listening', 'car', 'later', 'taking', 'bath', 'motel', 'Piano', 'Concertos', 'Opp', '89', '85', 'J.N', 'Hummel', 'specific', 'recording', 'recognized', 'immediately', 'own', 'Discover', 'Label', 'conducted', 'Alexander', 'Rahbari', 'pianist', 'Dana', 'Protopopescu', '[', 'had', 'always', 'suspected', 'Scully', 'would', 'be', 'lover', 'classical', 'music', ']', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'be', 'quite', 'unueven', 'quality', 'think', 'sense', 'more', 'unevenness', 'subject', 'matter', 'general', 'usually', 'prefer', 'episodes', 'directly', 'X-Files', 'Mythos', 'incidental', 'one-off', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'most', 'memorable', 'case', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'lesser', 'X-Files', 'episodes', 'are', 'least', 'head', 'shoulders', 'so', 'much', 'else', 'produced', 'TV.One', 'most', 'pleasant', 'themes', 'running', 'season', 'one', 'been', 'remarked', 'other', 'reviewers', 'increasing', 'intimacy', 'two', 'protagonists', 'are', 'almost', 'times', 'mirror', 'opposites', 'have', 'come', 'however', 'not', 'only', 'respect', 'other', 'wholly', 'love', 'other', 'fraternal', 'way', 'fact', 'are', 'time', 'intimate', 'friends', 'One', 'also', 'idea', 'never', 'explicitly', 'stated', 'perhaps', 'are', 'not', 'physically', 'least', 'other', 'type', 'care', 'other', 'slowly', 'wearing', 'objection', 'objection', 'be', 'down', 'are', 'gradually', 'drifting', 'romantic', 'rather', 'platonic', 'love', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'long', 'time', 'much', 'anticipated', 'kiss', 'Anyhow', 'season', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended']",The X-Files - The Complete Fifth Season

The two parter Redux & Redux II leads to a short story arc that has Mulder doubting his beliefes in aliens.  Season 5 is the shortest of the first 5 seasons so far, and I can only assume that this is because they were working on the movie at the same time to be released over the summer before season 6.  The thing about this season is that for the first time, the stand alone episodes outweigh the mythology episodes in quality.  Keeping this in mind, the mythology episodes are also few and far between.  There are only about 5 in this season, a low for the show at this point, but again this is most likely due to the movie being made.  This season also started an interesting form of episode:  the prequel episodes.  There are two here that deal with how The Lone Gunmen meet each other and Mulder, and another about a conspiracy in the 1950's.  Fortunately, there aren't really any episodes on this season that are actually ""bad"" to speak of.  There are some really good episodes, and that is what makes this season a good one.  This season continues the tradition of slim set special features consisting of commentaries, deleted scenes, international & special effects clips, etc.Notably Good Episodes:Redux (1)Redux II (2)Unusual SuspectsDetourThe Post-Modern PrometheusBad Blood (feat.

691600,A10872FHIJAKKD,B000060OFU,Just Bill,"[8, 8]","I used to think Season One was my favorite. No more. Season Five has blown away all previous seasons of The X-Files.Since I was not an X-Phile throughout the run of the series, and only watched an occasional episode, I had the privilege of watching the show unfold before my eyes, episode by episode, when I purchased the first four seasons on DVD. Then I totally immersed myself in the program.And I was hooked.Obviously, not being familiar with the unfolding story line, when I watched the last episode of Season Four (""Gethsemane""), I hadn't a clue how Mulder was going to return from the dead following that season's cliffhanger episode...and I had to wait until the release of Season Five on DVD to find out. I watched and re-watched every episode right up to that point...and wondered how in the hell Mulder was going to pull that one off.Finally! Season Five was released on DVD, and my curiosity was satiated.To say that I've been impressed with Season Five is a very mild understatement. So far, the first five or six episodes, alone, have left me with my mouth hanging open, riveted to every scene, clinging to every word.""Redux I"" and ""Redux II"" are astonishing episodes. Very powerful and gripping. The perfect way to start the new season.Thankfully, each episode in Season Five has held similar sway with me.But -- and I'm almost ashamed to admit this -- the episode that blew me away the most was the very offbeat, quirky-to-the-core ""Post Modern Prometheus."" I've watched that episode three times now, and I'm more impressed and touched by it every time.What a remarkably creative episode! Shot entirely in black and white, and telling a familiar horror movie tale (""Frankenstein""), ""Post Modern Prometheus"" weaves a spell over me like no other epside ever has. From the Cher-fueled score, to the tongue-in-cheek performances, to the Tim Burton-esque dream-like oddity, to the emotionally touching ending, ""Post Modern Prometheus"" is a jewel among an already glistening array.I would have bought Season Five just to get my hands on ""Post Modern Prometheus"" alone!The X-Files Season Five DVD set contains some of the best episodes the show has ever offered.

691601,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B000060OFU,Kenji Fujishima,"[2, 3]","By the end of the fourth season of THE X-FILES, Mulder had discovered that everything he had believed in about the existence of extra-terrestrials had been a big lie. Seemingly, he had killed himself as a result of this blinding revelation...but of course, who really believed that? So of course Mulder is back in Season 5 trying to dig deeper into the deep, dark secrets of aliens and our own government, and undergoing a radical ideological change in the process. By ""Patient X""/""The Red and the Black"", he has turned into a skeptic, even as a faceless alien rebel force had suddenly made its way onto our planet and caused mass murders. But as ""The Red and the Black"" closes, Mulder even starts to question his own skepticism. Boy, the lengths X-FILES creator Chris Carter will go to frustrate his audience.The 5th Season of THE X-FILES---which lasted a mere 20 episodes, as the crew was working hard on the upcoming X-FILES movie---still finds the show in good form, but it is with the mythological developments of this season that I think the alien mythology of the show began its decline into muddle and, eventually, painful drawn-out death. In the first three seasons,  THE X-FILES' grand conspiracy story deftly mixed our deepest paranoia with our love of the freaky to make it fun and exciting. But, with the blinding revelation of Season 4's concluding ""Gethsemane"" and the introduction of the faceless alien rebels in Season 5, I personally started to feel less intrigued than exasperated at its hard-to-swallow twists and turns. (Guess again if you think one of the main characters is really dead by the end of ""Redux II""; notwithstanding Mulder's resurrection in Season 3's ""The Blessing Way,"" it seems like all the wrong characters come back to life in this X-FILES universe.) In his quest to continually keep his audience on its toes, Chris Carter kept piling on the twists until, by Season 6 onward, there was nowhere left for the alien mytharcs to go but down...and down it went.Still, ""Redux""/""Redux II"" was a fine opening two-parter, filled with the kind of convoluted plotting and strong emotions that made the opening diptych of Season 3 classic mythological X-FILES. (The tears Mulder sheds at Scully's hospital bedside in one scene in ""Redux II"" will break your heart.) Unfortunately, ""Christmas Carol""/""Emily"", in which Scully discovers she bore a daughter during her abduction experience, seems more emotionally brutal than gripping---poor Scully has already gone through a draining bout with cancer; now she has to go through another (futile) life-saving bout on account of a daughter she never knew she had? It's a little much, if you ask me. And the aforementioned ""Patient X""/""The Red and the Black"" just seemed lifeless, totally lacking in the kind of spark that infused, say, ""Colony""/""Endgame"" (still the most viscerally thrilling of X-FILES mytharcs). Finally, the season ends with ""The End,"" which introduces another mythological chess piece: Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka), the young mind-reading kid who may or may not be part-alien.If the mythological developments of Season 5 sometimes fail to stimulate, there are still some excellent standalone episodes to keep your eyes open (which, arguably, were the only reasons left to watch the show in its later seasons). As with the previous season, the highlight of these standalones is another Vince Gilligan foray into hilarious self-parody and satire, ""Bad Blood."" The RASHOMON-like structure of the first half, especially, is a brilliant masterstroke, cleverly revealing the way both Mulder and Scully see each other. (The truth may be out there, but as Kurosawa masterfully demonstrated in his classic film, it is ultimately unknowable...except for the part about the buck teeth.) Other notables include:Chris Carter's clever B&W; comic-book ""Post-Modern Prometheus,"" a modern-day retelling of Mary Shelley's classic FRANKENSTEIN tale, with John O'Hurley---commonly known as SEINFELD's J. Peterman---well cast as the (subtly) mad Dr. Pollidori.The convoluted, jargon-filled, yet thrilling ""Kill Switch,"" co-written by famed ""cyberpunk"" author William Gibson and directed by Rob Bowman, who has an unerring sense of the kinetic. Gibson and co-writer Tom Maddox create a dark, ugly, chilling tale about paranoia and live artificial intelligence.""Mind's Eye"" has a terrific performance from Lili Taylor as a blind woman whom Mulder believes is innocent of murder, regardless of all the evidence stacked against her. Taylor vividly creates a spunky, sometimes abrasive character who refuses to be pitied under any circumstances; it's a memorable, touching performance.Religion-themed X-FILES episodes are usually stimulating, and ""All Souls"" is no exception, an episode which finds Scully still dealing with the emotional grief of having lost her daughter Emily. Perhaps actress Gillian Anderson's finest episode.Rob Bowman returns to the directing helm with the exciting ""Pine Bluff Variant,"" in which Mulder gets involved in a bioterrorist plot. As an action hero, David Duchovny has nothing on Bruce Willis, but the episode nevertheless is a lot of fun, provided you don't think too much about it afterward.And ""Folie a Deux"" is a fine penultimate episode involving a telemarketing company who may or may not be under the control of a man-bug who sucks the life out of his victims. If you think Mulder went to the edge of madness in Season 3's underrated ""Grotesque""...he goes even further in ""Folie a Deux."" Just look at the title.Sure, the quality of the standalones may not be as consistent as they were in Season 3---don't even bother with the pointless ""Kitsunegari"" if you loved Season 3's ""Pusher""---but, even in lesser episodes, there was always the rapport between David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, still managing to strike some sparks here and there to keep us intrigued in their characters' relationship.All in all, the 5th Season of the X-FILES is not one of the show's best---it is done in by the rather lackluster mythology episodes.

This was the first season of X-File to be filmed in HDTV (High Definition TV), so widescreen prints are available, and the DVD box presents the episodes in this format.This turns out to be something of a mixed blessing.  The HD masters appear to have lopped off the top and bottom of the picture, so that in many close up scenes, you don't see the top of Skinner's and Mulder's heads.  Also, the picture is marginally less crisp than in previous releases; it looks somewhat grainier.On the plus side, it does fill your screen... and X-Files is still fun, even if you feel the third, or fourth, or second seasons were the show's peak.If you have a &quot;regular&quot; TV set, you should see black bars at the top and bottom.No particular comments on the quality of season five.  Any TV show that stretches to five seasons is going to sacrifice some quality somewhere; and the fact that X-Files has stumbled into Season Nine before finally running out of steam altogether says a lot about the talent behind this series.

All of it leading up to ""Fight the Future"" which was filmed prior to filming this entire season that leads up to the movie!  Simply stated, Chris Carter and his entire staff are geniuses.Redux - {mythology} - Last seasons ""Gethsemane"" ended with Fox Mulder appearing to be dead from a self inflicted shotgun blast.  Mulder is able to obtain an ID that allows him access to a DOD complex where the CSM allows him to escape with the cure for Scully's cancer.Redux II - {mythology} - This is the outstanding conclusion to the mini trilogy.  The CSM offers Mulder all the answers.  Scully's cancer is finally in remission thanks to the device that Mulder found.  Mulder weeds out the FBI mole, who is shortly thereafter assassinated.  The big news, the CSM is shot in his own apartment, yet no body is found.  With episodes like these first two, season five continues to prove what an excellent experience The X-Files is.Unusual Suspects - {mythology} - A beautifully well scripted episode detailing the events in 1989 that brought the ""Lone Gunmen"" together.  This episode also includes a surprise appearance by ""X"" as well.  Surprisingly enough, the events of this episode are what put Mulder and the Lone Gunmen on the quest that they are all on.Detour - Another well written episode where Scully and Mulder are stuck having to go to team building retreat with a married pair of agents.  Fortunately for Mulder's sanity, they have to stop along the way because of a police road block.  They find out that people were coming up missing in the woods in a strange way.  This episode has some very touching scenes belying the relationship that is building between Mulder and Scully.The Post-Modern Prometheus - This episode is an absolutely wonderful, campy black & white episode where The X-Files once again proves that they can lighten up and have a little fun.  Jerry Springer stars as himself in the background as Mulder and Scully find themselves in a town full of die hard Springer fans and a monster in ""The Mutato.""Christmas Carol & Emily - {mythology} - Simply stated, these are two of the finest, touching and most heartfelt episodes of not only the season but the entire series!  Scully is on Christmas vacation with her family in California and receives what seems to be a phone call from her sister, who was killed in an earlier season.  This phone call leads to the discovery of a little girl that Dana believes to be the daughter of her sister!  ""Emily"" brings Mulder into the picture and the real ""mythology"" aspects of these two spectacular episodes kicks in!  These two episodes alone make the entire season!Kitsunegari - D&eacute;j&agrave; vu', Robert Modell from the third season episode ""Pusher"" is back.  He's survived the bullet that Mulder put in his head and he's back to ""pushing"" people into what he wants them to do.  This episode is one of the most intriguing of the season.Schizogeny - This is a particularly intriguing episode about child abuse and the way one woman dealt with her abuse.Chinga - Written by Stephen King and Chris Carter.  This episode certainly qualifies as one of the best of the season and the entire nine year run as producer Chris Carter welcomes the ""King of Horror"" in Stephen King as a co-writer.  This episode has everything that one can expect from King, suspense and horror in full measure.  This is certainly a classic X-Files episode that is not to be missed.Kill Switch - This is a superb episode in both its setup and execution as The X-Files explores Artificial Intelligence in the best way that only they can.  This is a perfect ""Lone Gunmen"" style episode.Bad Blood - This is another outstandingly funny, yet scary episode that the producers have proven their superiority at.  Mulder and Scully find themselves in Texas looking for a vampire and ultimately find much more than they bargained for.  The banter between them just keeps getting better and better.Patient X & The Red and the Black - {mythology} - Two outstanding episodes that serve extremely well to further the mythology of ""The X-Files.""  Mulder's lost faith is quite prominent as Scully gains faith in the possibility of aliens.  Some of the ""facts"" that die hard fans have been waiting several years for are beginning to slip from Chris Carter finally.  This is also the episode that introduces Agent Spinder, CSM's son.Travelers - {part mythology} Travelers is a brilliant prequel episode that first takes us back to 1990, before Mulder's taking the X-Files, then takes us to a case going back to 50's and his father working for the State Department.Mind's Eye - A beautifully well written episode that is both touching and heartwarming.  It is about a woman, blind from birth who has been accused of a brutal murder.All Souls - This is another breathtaking episode where The X-Files explores Scully's faith in God.The Pine Bluff Variant - Agent Mulder finds himself undercover and in the midst of one of the very government conspiracies that he seeks to expose, but finds the truth too shocking to reveal.Folie a deux - This episode contains the best one liner to date in the series.  Mulder is sent to Chicago to discover who is threatening an office with terrorism and finds that he is seeing the same thing that the ""madman"" was seeing.The End - {mythology} Another outstanding season finale that leads up to the movie.  CSM is back and in full force and doing his thing.  This is the episode that introduces Gibson, the child who, born with alien DNA is capable of reading minds.  CSM succeeds in having The X-Files closed.Extra Features - Just as it was with the first four seasons, the special features disk for season five is outstanding.  This one finally includes some blooper scenes.",5,The X-Files Season 5  Another outstanding season!,1042761600,"01 17, 2003",2003,5849,"['Intricacies', 'subtleties', 'nuances', 'BLAM', 'straight',

Now that the DVD sets have been reduced in price, I had the opportunity to start watching the show. After watching the first four seasons on DVD I have become a huge fan, and in my opinion The X-Files is one of the most addictive and well done science fiction shows ever created. However, the only five star season that was great from start to finish, was the third season. Going into season five, I never expected to see a season of The X-Files that could manage to overcome season three in terms of storytelling and episode quality. I was wrong. The fifth season was absolutely amazing. I enjoyed every single episode, and I doubt that any season for the rest of the show will be able to top it.The thing that I probably enjoyed the most about season five, is that Mulder and Scully switch roles. Based on what he learns at the end of season four, Mulder turns somewhat skeptical and comes to think that everything he believed in was a lie, while Scully starts to become more of a believer based on things she discovers about her abduction. The fifth season offers so many wonderful episodes, it is hard to choose a favorite. The first two episodes &quot;Redux&quot; and &quot;Redux II&quot; offer a wonderful conclusion to the season four cliffhanger. One of my favorite episodes &quot;Unusual Suspects&quot; goes into how the Lone Gunmen came to be. &quot;The Post-Modern Prometheus&quot; is loosely based on the Frankenstien monster, and is shot in black and white. This was definately one of the best episodes I have seen so far. Everything from the writing and cinematography, to the music used was fantastic. &quot;Bad Blood&quot; is the funniest and most entertaining episode of The X-Files that I have ever seen, and will probably go down as being my favorite episode of the entire show. &quot;The End&quot; is the best season finale of the show that I have seen so far, and is definately on my top ten list for best episodes.Overall, the fifth season of The X-Files is the best season I have seen so far. While there were only 20 episodes, each one managed to be fantastic. The fifth season would be worth owning for the episodes alone. However, the DVD package is great. This was the first DVD set to offer the episodes in widescreen! The extras are very good as well. My favorite feature was the 45 minute &quot;Inside the X-Files&quot; featurette. It was very in-depth and featured tons of great information. You also get deleted scenes with commentary from series creator Chris Carter, commentary on the episodes &quot;The Post-Modern Prometheus&quot; and &quot;The Pine Bluff Variant&quot; from the writer of those particular episodes, and more.A solid 5 stars...",5,Incredible season..

691611,A376YDPAWRIX1C,B000060OFU,"mugsy ""mugsy1963""","[6, 7]","I am a big time fan. The season contains some missteps, but contains some classics, too. Pros: Bad Blood (absolutely THE BEST COMEDIC X-FILES EPISODE ever. Insight into how M & S see each other.), Detour (M & S as buddies/husband & wifelike--""Did you pack everything?"" and ""Predator"" feel), Folie a Deux (very underrated episode and has a boogie man feel.), The Pine Bluff Variant (Is Mulder a bad guy?), Kill Switch (Mulder held against his will...hmm...very interesting! Also, hints of KickAss!Scully), and All Souls (scary episode, bad special effects, though. Many fans don't like this episode.). Cons: The Post-Modern Prometheus (One of THE worst X-Files episodes. I really don't know why this a favorite of fans. A freak of nature impregnating women while playing Cher music, need I say more?), the mytharc episodes of Christmas Carol/Emily (Scully has a daughter. Mulder not telling her about her ova being tested until now?...Right.  S turns away M.), the other mytharc episodes of Patient X/The Red and the Black (Scully is a believer.  S is made to sound like she is having an orgasm during hypnosis.  Very embarassing.  Krycek kisses M.  I think it's love!), and Travelers (not much of Mulder and no Scully). Season 5 brought us Skeptic Mulder (or Unbelievably Skeptic Mulder). Thank goodness the writers brought back Spooky Mulder in the following season. Continuation of the M & S ""possibly want to be romantically involved"" relationship. Redux/Redux II (M & S crying and being affectionate) and The End (Scully being aware of her feelings for Mulder when Diana Fowley appeared.  Thank goodness Mimi Rogers' services were not needed after a few episodes into Season 7.). Overall, good season. End of an era since this season was the last season to be shot in Canada.

691612,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000060OFU,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[5, 5]","The mid-point of the X-Files series; the fifth season gave more insight and teasers to the vast alien conspiracy story arc that was finally beginning to take the forefront of the show (the results of which were good and bad) and introduced new characters (Agent Spender, the seemingly clairvoyant child Gibson Praise, Mulder's old flame Agent Diana Fowley played by Mimi Rogers) that would go on to play major parts in the rest of the series, while giving more insight to current supporting characters like the Lone Gunmen, Alex Krycek, and the Cancer Man.  Many revelations are abound throughout this season, including what role Mulder's father played in the beginning of the conspiracy, and it is hinted at that maybe Mulder is meant for far much more.  Also, to many fans' delight, we see the growth of Mulder and Scully's relationship as tender, yearning glances between them are abound.  Standout episodes include the Stephen King penned ""Chinga"", ""Unusual Suspects"" which flashes back to Mulder's first metting with the Lone Gunmen, ""Post-Modern Prometheus"", the amusing ""Travelers"", ""Patient X"", and the absolutely hilarious (and justifiably a fan favorite) ""Bad Blood"" which guest stars Luke Wilson, and shows how Mulder and Scully see each other while recalling a case where they were investigating vampirism.  Plenty of loose ends are purposely left for the X-Files movie which premiered the following summer, but in the end this is probably one of the last best seasons of the series, and the last season of the show to be filmed in Canada before the series moved to Hollywood.",5,One of the last great seasons of the series,1064361600,"09 24, 2003",2003,1588,"['mid-point', 'X-Files', 'series', 'fifth', 'season', 'gave', 'more', 'insight', 'teasers', 'vast', 'alien', 'conspiracy', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'finally', 'beginning', 'take', 'forefront', 'show', 'results', 'were', 'good', 'bad', 'introduced', 'new', 'characters', 'Agent', 'Spender', 'seemingly', 'clairvoyant', 'child', 'Gibson', 'Praise', 'Mulder', 'old', 'flame', 'Agent', 'Diana', 'Fowley', 'played', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'would', 'go', 'play', 'major', 'parts', 'rest', 'series', 'giving', 'more', 'insight', 'current', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'Alex', 'Krycek', 'Cancer', 'Man', 'Many', 'revelations', 'are', 'abound', 'season', 'including', 'what', 'role', 'Mulder', 'father', 'played', 'beginning', 'conspiracy', 'hinted', 'maybe', 'Mulder', 'meant', 'far', 'much', 'more', 'Also', 'many', 'fans', 'delight', 'see', 'growth', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'relationship', 'tender', 'yearning', 'glances', 'are', 'abound', 'Standout', 'include', 'Stephen', 'King', 'penned', 'Chinga', 'Unusual', 'Suspects', 'back', 'Mulder', 'first', 'metting', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'Post-Modern', 'Prometheus', 'amusing', 'Travelers', 'Patient', 'X', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'justifiably', 'fan', 'favorite', 'Bad', 'Blood', 'guest', 'stars', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'how', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'see', 'other', 'recalling', 'case', 'where', 'were', 'investigating', 'vampirism', 'Plenty', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'purposely', 'left', 'X-Files', 'movie', 'premiered', 'following', 'summer', 'end', 'probably', 'one', 'last', 'best', 'seasons', 'series', 'last', 'season', 'show', 'be', 'filmed', 'Canada', 'series', 'moved', 'Hollywood']",The X-Files - The Complete Fifth Season
691613,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000060OFU,OverTheMoon,"[3, 5]","The Critically Acclaimed Season V (This season goes Widescreen)The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. There are some improvements since the Season III DVD case with a seventh bonus disc now inside a cardboard holder and not just sitting in a slot in a piece of card that falls out easily like in Season I and II, bouncing around the box. Season V actually has the bonus disc in with actual holder itself. Not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. It depends on the edition. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X-Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 episode discs in total, making an average of 25 episodes for most seasons. Some seasons have more or less than this figure. Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are no commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. They could have at least provided us with the X-Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. Since the show was shot in full frame until Season 5, these dimensions are retained. Season 5 is the first X-Files season to go Widescreen 1.78:1X-Files: Season five follows in the steps of Season two, produces a virtually unstoppable series of great episodes, now that it has been firmly established as mainstream TV series viewing. Although the `to be continued ending' of Season four is not the best beginnings to a season, and the first few episodes are a bit dodgy, this is all forgiven when the screenwriters decide to go back and follow in the steps of Season 2's acclaim. There is a crazy role reversal. Mulder believes that the hegemony and the alien colonization of planet Earth is a con to detract from what is simply a series of government experiments on the citizens of planet Earth and the alien agenda just subterfuge. Scully however is absolutely convinced that Mulder was right all long and so takes the lead role as the paranormal investigator while Mulder turns sceptic. This character switch works wonders and kudos to the screenwriters for doing it. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) is dead as is Mr X (Steven Williams), however packs of Morley's turn up from time to time. Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is more aware that something paranormal is going on and even sides with Scully when Mulder lambastes both for being delusional. Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden) has a secret. `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) are back and even have their own private episode of how they came to be together. The Well-Manicured Man (John Neville from ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"") is back and Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) has another surprise in store. Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin) is gone, long since dead, however Section Chief Scott Blevins (Charles Cioffi) from Season 1 (and a bit of Season 4) is back for a very important double episode. There is also the introduction of Special Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) who also plays a significant role. Robert Modell (Robert Wisden) from Season Two's Pusher is back.The X-files season five is some of the best X-files to date. More conspiracy and more major revelations, means that you will be hooked from disc 2 onwards, right to the staggering finale. There are also a few supporting actors you have seen in movies. And yes, thankfully after 3 seasons of Scully's overrun cancer suffering, this is about to come to an end. Season five of the X-Files is mostly about - pre-X files back stories, Scully's cancer, mothman, mystery offspring, Frankenstein, Modell the pusher, psychotherapy, witchcraft, AI, vampires, extraterrestrial wars, hoasting alien experiments, blind psychics, Angels and Demons, government toxins, monsters and ESP. Episodes ""Kitsunegari"", ""Kill Switch"", ""Bad Blood"" and ""All Souls"" stand out as great non-conspiracy episodes, but the final episode is one of the best conspiracy episodes to date. The best episode is ""Folie &Agrave; Deux"" which has a terrific monster story and some really mad special effects for a television episode. Season 5 is all top stuff. Remember before moving onto Season 6, you are supposed to watch X Files the movie first! After the movie, then go on to Season 6.",5,The Critically Acclaimed Season V (This season goes Widescreen),1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,6718,"['Critically', 'Acclaimed', 'Season', 'V', 'season',

691614,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B000060OFU,Patrick Correa,"[1, 2]","This was the last season I saw of X-Files as a kid.  I don&#8217;t know why I stopped watching it, I guess I just got distracted by other things.  Clearly I had no taste, because this is definitely one of my top 3 seasons so far; possibly the best.  Here&#8217;s a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia & the ones I saw with my aunt marked.*98.  Redux:  Scully helps Mulder fake his death, but comes under intense scrutiny; Skinner is suspected as the traitor inside the FBI; and Mulder breaks into the Department of Defense in a desperate bid to save Scully, but while doing so he finds himself facing the truth about the aliens he has been chasing.  The quality of the last episode doesn&#8217;t let up.  A+*99.  Redux II:  While Scully lies on her deathbed; the Smoking Man makes an important decision in helping Mulder.  An excellent conclusion.  A+*100.  Unusual Suspects:  The origins of the Lone Gunmen are explored.  In 1989, two salesmen and a federal employee join forces when they meet Susanne Modeski, a woman who claims that she is being pursued by her violent ex-boyfriend, an FBI agent named Fox Mulder.  A great episode about how Mulder befriended 3 of my favorite characters in this show.  A+*101.  Detour:  On the way to an FBI convention in Florida, Mulder and Scully stop to help in the investigation of the mysterious disappearance of three people in the woods, where invisible humanoids lurk.  Another great episode with some effective scares & great make-up for the monsters.  A+*102.  The Post-Modern Prometheus:  Mulder and Scully&#8217;s investigate a letter from a single mother that leads them to a small town where a modern-day version of Frankenstein's monster lurks, Jerry Springer is an obsession, and Cher plays a significant part.  This was a delightfully odd episode.  The ending was a bit silly, but the rest was great.  A*103.  Christmas Carol:  Home for the holidays, Scully is haunted by dreams which hint at a strange connection to a murdered woman&#8217;s daughter.  Pretty good, but not enough Mulder.  A-*104. Emily:  Scully fights to protect her daughter&#8217;s life, while Mulder discovers her true origins.  Now this is more like it.  With Mulder in the picture, this story becomes excellent. A+*105.  Kitsunegari:  When 'Pusher' Modell escapes from prison, Mulder and Scully race to catch him before he can take revenge against his favorite target &#8211; Agent Mulder.  A great follow-up to the Pusher.  I do like the original better, but this is still a great episode.  A*106.  Schizogeny:  When a teenager is suspected of murdering his father, Mulder and Scully become convinced that a greater evil may be lurking in the community.  Not the best episode, but not the worst.  Seriously, why do people think the trees killing people was lame?  That&#8217;s actually pretty creepy to me because I can see it happening.  B+*107.  Chinga:  Scully takes a vacation to Maine, where she encounters a bizarre case where the victims appear to have inflicted wounds upon themselves &#8211; apparently at the behest of a strange young girl.  Stephen King contributes a great episode.  It wasn&#8217;t perfect, but there were some really good scares here.  A-*108.  Kill Switch:  While investigating the strange circumstances of the death of a reclusive computer genius rumored to have been researching artificial intelligence, Mulder and Scully become targets of an unlikely killer capable of the worst kind of torture.  This is an excellent episode.  A+*109.  Bad Blood:  While investigating bizarre exsanguinations in Texas, Mulder kills a teenage boy whom he &#34;mistakes&#34; for a vampire.  Awaiting a meeting with Skinner, Mulder and Scully attempt to get their stories &#8220;straight&#8221; by relating to each other their differing versions of what happened during their investigation.  Gillian Anderson&#8217;s favorite episode is certainly one of mine.  A+110.  Patient X:  Scully forms a bond with Cassandra Spender, a woman who claims to have been abducted by aliens.  While Mulder&#8217;s disbelief in the alien conspiracy is now questioned, he finds himself with more personal threats at the FBI.  The beginning of a great 2 part story.  A111.  The Red and the Black:  With Cassandra Spender missing, and her son Jeffrey angrily attempting to push his way up in the FBI, Mulder has Scully put under hypnosis to learn the truth.  The Syndicate, meanwhile, quicken their tests for the alien vaccine, sacrificing their own to do so.  A great conclusion.  A*112.  Travelers:  In 1990, a bizarre murder leads young agent Fox Mulder to question a former FBI Agent who investigated one of the first X-Files dating back to the 1950s &#8211; a case which may have involved Mulder&#8217;s father.  Another classic episode, with a really scary monster.  A+113.  Mind&#8217;s Eye:  Agents Mulder and Scully investigate a murder that seems to have been committed by a blind woman, but Mulder suspects that her involvement is not what it seems.  This is one of the worst episodes.  It started off interesting, but it quickly became frustrating.  The only good part was the guest appearance of Blu Mankuma, who voiced one character in each show of the Mainframe trilogy (ReBoot, Beast Wars & War Planets).  D+*114.  All Souls:  The unexplained death of a young handicapped girl prompts Father McCue to ask Scully for her help, but her investigation leads her to a mystery she's afraid to understand.  A*115.  The Pine Bluff Variant:  Scully begins to grow suspicious of Mulder, whose increasingly strange behavior suggests he may be serving another agenda.  A*116.  Folie a Deux:  Mulder and Scully encounter a delusional man who believes his boss may be a monster &#8211; and is willing to pay any price to prove it.  A*117.  The End:  Investigating the murder of a chess player, Mulder and Scully meet a boy who may be the embodiment of everything in the X-Files.  An epic episode to end the season on.  A+This was a really good season.  There was only one bad episode in the whole bunch, & this had the most epic Myth Arc episodes since the ones in season 2 where Scully was abducted.

691615,A1DDDTSZJL6M2I,B000060OFU,"Paul HItch ""HItchy""","[2, 2]","Season five of the X-Files was remembered for a few notable facts. The first, and most important, was that this was the last series shot in Vancouver.Many people have stated that the show was never quite the same after this and I would have to agree.Unlinke many reviewers though, I did not think that the subsequent seasons to this were in anyway terrible, but if you look back at any of the first five seasons, you will see the grittiness and eerieness that seemed to permeate through much of the stories.This season ( five ) is no exception, and well and truly holds up well to the first four excellent seasons.First the negatives.The first very slight cracks in the mythology episodes start, as they started to become a little complicated to follow.As a whole, all in all, the mythology episodes were again first class, with the usual characters living up to most peoples expectations. Perhaps any fans disappointment are simply the introduction of too many elements, that are hard to reconcile.The other negatives would include a few more than usual"" stinkers "" in this season, more than any other previous season that I can recall.I feel this is in no way connected to either David Duchovny or Gillian Anderson, but simply average scripts, bought on by the pressure to film quickly after filming the movie.So the ones I didn't like?Well, "" Detour"" was a little far fetched for mine ( a monster hidden in the forest) The humour was ok though."" Christmas Carol"" and "" Emily "" were just a little better than average- they could have benefitted from a faster pace, as they were very slow."" Schizogeny"" and "" Chinga"" were just plain stinkers, pure and simple! Sorry, didn't like them one bit!But for the good stuff:The stand-alone episodes were once again excellent with my favourites including the following:"" Unusual suspects"" featuring the Lone Gunmen prominantly, basically how they formed- a great comedy drama episode."" Bad Blood"" was again a different direction as they explored comdey from yet another angle with different points of view telling the same story."" Minds Eye"" I found this one quite captivating as a blind woman can somehow "" see"" her fathers killing people. Very interesting story."" The Pine Bluff Variant""- top notch thriller episode as Mulder infiltrates a terrorist group, also features Skinner quite a bit which I always enjoy.All in all, an enjoyable season, if not quite as good as the first four seasons.I also loved the cliffhanger episode "" The End "" appropriately named as many reviewers have pointed out as the last episode shot in Vancouver. It introduces a child prodigy named Gibson Praise, a mind reader, and possible part alien, he plays a chess champion who avoids an assasination attempt.The other notable point for this season ( also that many reviewers have pointed out! ) is that the X-Fles movie directly follows this season, and remarkably was shot before the entire season.This for me explains why the quality was missing from several episodes, and why the season was just twenty episodes long!As usual the box set contains excellent extras, including interviews and special effects highlights, deleted scenes etc which are a must for any serious X-File fan.Still a more than worthwhile addition to your X-File Collection.Thanks for reading",4,Turning point in this great sci-fi series!,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,3288,"['Season', 'five', 'X-Files', 'was', 'remembered', 'few', 'notable', 'facts', 'first', 'most', 'important', 'was', 'was', 'last', 'series', 'shot', 'Vancouver.Many', 'people', 'have', 'stated', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'same', 'would', 'have', 'agree.Unlinke', 'many', 'reviewers', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'were', 'anyway', 'terrible', 'look', 'back', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'will', 'see', 'grittiness', 'eerieness', 'seemed', 'permeate', 'much', 'stories.This', 'season', 'five', 'exception', 'well', 'truly', 'up', 'well', 'first', 'four', 'excellent', 'seasons.First', 'negatives.The', 'first', 'very', 'slight', 'cracks', 'mythology', 'start', 'started', 'become', 'little', 'complicated', 'follow.As', 'whole', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'were', 'again', 'first', 'class', 'usual', 'characters', 'living', 'up', 'most', 'peoples', 'expectations', 'Perhaps', 'fans', 'disappointment', 'are', 'simply', 'introduction', 'too', 'many', 'elements', 'are', 'hard', 'reconcile.The', 'other', 'negatives', 'would', 'include', 'few', 'more', 'usual', 'stinkers', 'season', 'more', 'other', 'previous', 'season', 'can', 'recall.I', 'feel', 'way', 'connected', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'simply', 'average', 'scripts', 'bought', 'pressure', 'film', 'quickly', 'filming', 'movie.So', 'ones', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Well', 'Detour', 'was', 'little', 'far', 'fetched', 'mine', 'monster', 'hidden', 'forest', 'humour', 'was', 'ok', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Emily', 'were', 'just', 'little', 'better', 'average-', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', 'faster', 'pace', 'were', 'very', 'slow', 'Schizogeny', 'Chinga', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'stinkers', 'pure', 'simple', 'Sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'bit', 'good', 'stuff', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'were', 'once', 'again', 'excellent', 'favourites', 'including', 'following', 'Unusual', 'suspects', 'featuring', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'prominantly', 'basically', 'how', 'formed-', 'great', 'comedy', 'drama', 'episode', 'Bad', 'Blood', 'was', 'again', 'different', 'direction', 'explored', 'comdey', 'yet', 'angle', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'telling', 'same', 'story', 'Eye', 'found', 'one', 'quite', 'captivating', 'blind', 'woman', 'can', 'somehow', 'see', 'fathers', 'killing', 'people', 'Very', 'interesting', 'story', 'Pine', 'Bluff', 'Variant', 'top', 'notch', 'thriller', 'episode', 'Mulder', 'terrorist', 'group', 'also', 'Skinner', 'quite', 'bit', 'always', 'enjoy.All', 'enjoyable', 'season', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'four', 'seasons.I', 'also', 'loved', 'cliffhanger', 'episode', 'End', 'appropriately', 'named', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'last', 'episode', 'shot', 'Vancouver', 'child', 'prodigy', 'named', 'Gibson', 'Praise', 'mind', 'reader', 'possible', 'part', 'alien', 'chess', 'champion', 'who', 'assasination', 'attempt.The', 'other', 'notable', 'point', 'season', 'also', 'that', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'X-Fles', 'movie', 'directly', 'season', 'remarkably', 'was', 'shot', 'entire', 'season.This', 'why', 'quality', 'was', 'missing', 'several', 'episodes', 'why', 'season', 'was', 'just', 'twenty', 'episodes', 'long', 'usual', 'box', 'set', 'excellent', 'extras', 'including', 'interviews', 'special', 'effects', 'highlights', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'etc', 'are', 'must', 'serious', 'X-File', 'fan.Still', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'addition', 'X-File', 'Collection.Thanks', 'reading']",The X-Files - The Complete Fifth Season

David Duchovny added so much to his character he seems like a real guy. Mitch Pileggi's performance at portraying the cool, level minded Skinner is always the humble hero for Mulder and Scully and for the viewer. Gillian Anderson is so convincing, we all know her as Scully, that's just how top notch these actors are. Mark Snow's haunting melodic music brings a chill to each scene. Chris Carter's idea for a TV show is by far better than most SCI FI shows. The X Files is an instant classic telling science fiction stories as it was meant to be.I have to include Millennium, if you have not scene it, ignore the critics and try it. I thought that was one of Chris Carter's best ideas. I also have all three seasons of Millennium on DVD.In my opinion, the reason why the X Files films did not do so well is because they already used the same quality of writing and producing for TV.No SCI FI show today has the look, the music and quality of guest casting like the X Files.

691619,A3559I6Q7RCPP3,B000060OFU,"Robert Cossaboon ""devil doll""","[4, 5]","Keeping in mind this review will probably get buried amongst the countless others . . . Most people feel that Season 5 was the last real good season of the X-Files.  For me it was season 4, but there is still much to enjoy here in this season-it's just that Carter and the character of Mulder seem much more cynical now, after the season 4 cliffhanger of Gethesame.  What made season 5 interesting for me was the way the mythology story arc expanded to include a rebel branch of aliens.  All of the supporting characters from Krychek to the Lone Gunmen were becoming larger than life; you have a real sense of an epic rapidly approaching some kind of resolution.  There are two two-parter stories that in some way expand upon the central story arc:  Christmas Carol/Emily and Patient X/The Red and the Black.  Of these, the first pair was weaker because they  shamelessly  worked the motherhood card with Scully and revolved around her emotional relationship with a little girl; it also laid the seeds for her bigger motherhood experience to come later in season 8.  It's hard to work action sequences into a eugenics episode.  Emily has some fine eerie music to it, however.  The second two-parter was much more satisfying, because the pace was kept much more constant and tense.  As for the coined Monster of the Week episodes, my favorites were:  Bad Blood for its humorous Rashoman take on vampirism in a small town; Schizogeny, a chilling black magic episode; and finally, the best, Folie a Deux, a truly hallucinogenic episode!  Post-modern Prometheus, Carter's special take on the Frankenstein mythos, deserves special mention, because it tries so hard to be striking and original--but it isn't.  The episode tries to do too much:  shot in black in white, weird perspective shots, humor, and a meta-realistic ending that derails the whole story.  Another special mention:  Kitsunegari was one of the first of a few episodes to bring a past villian out of ice in a shameless, sensationalistic attempt to bolster ratings (which were already high in the first place).  This story at least is involving and suspenseful, with an ending that lives up to the story that builds up to it.  Featured also in this series were two prominent guest writers:  Stephen King and William Gibson in the respective episodes Chinga and Kill Switch.  Chinga is best not talked about, but Kill Switch was triumph of technobabble meets tense edge-of-your seat action.  The greatness of a season can be measure by how fast it passes without you knowing it.  To be sure, by the time I had finished the season closer, The End, I felt time had slipped so suddenly.

Also, several people say that it was in this season that the mythology had become too hard to follow, but I don't think so. Some people also say that the mythology episodes are dull. What are they talking about!? Season five has 4 of the greatest mythology episodes in the history of the show. Below I have a summary of some of the seasons good episodes, of which there were alot of.SPOILERS AHEADRedux: Mulder is in fact alive, and he goes to the Pentagon to look for a cure for Scully's cancer. Meanwhile, Scully covers up Mulder's death, but Skinner sees through it.Redux II: Scully faints and has to be rushed off too the hospital due to her cancer. Mulder gets in touch with CSM who will give him the cure to Scully's cancer if he quits the FBI.Unusual Suspects: We go back to 1989 to discover how the Lone Gunmen came to be.Detour: Mulder and Scully investigate the disappearance of a man in Florida. Some good one liners through out.Christmas Carol: My favorite episode. Scully receives a phone call that she traces to the Sim residence, where she finds a child she believes to be her dead sisters.Emily: Scully finds out that Emily is in fact her daughter, and shetries to protect her, but someone is out to kill her.Kitsunegari: Robert ""Pusher"" Modell has escaped from a psych ward and begins toying with Mulder's mind.Bad Blood: Mulder and Scully argue about the events of what happened to them in Texas. Very funny.Patient X: An alien abductee has Scully beginning to believe in aliens.The Red And The Black: Scully survives the faceless aliens on the bridge, and she goes with Mulder to try and uncover the truth.Pine Bluff Variant: Mulder tries to stop a man from spreading a deadly virus, but Scully thinks Mulder is a part of it.The End: The near assassination of a 12 year old boy has leads Mulder to a stunning conclusion that could be the ultimate proof of extraterrestrial life.The fifth season will always be remembered as the season of the hilarious self parody episode Bad Blood, but some people seem to forget that season five is home to some of the best mythology episodes in the series.",5,The End,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,2236,"['Season', 'five', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'last', 'season', 'filmed', 'Vancouver', 'end', 'so', 'called', 'glory', 'years', 'Also', 'several', 'people', 'say', 'was', 'season', 'mythology', 'had', 'become', 'too', 'hard', 'follow', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'people', 'also', 'say', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'are', 'dull', 'What', 'are', 'talking', 'Season', 'five', '4', 'greatest', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'history', 'show', 'have', 'summary', 'seasons', 'good', 'episodes', 'were', 'alot', 'of.SPOILERS', 'AHEADRedux', 'Mulder', 'fact', 'alive', 'Pentagon', 'look', 'cure', 'Scully', 'cancer', 'Meanwhile', 'Scully', 'up', 'Mulder', 'death', 'Skinner', 'it.Redux', 'II', 'Scully', 'faints', 'be', 'rushed', 'off', 'too', 'hospital', 'due', 'cancer', 'Mulder', 'touch', 'CSM', 'who', 'will', 'give', 'cure', 'Scully', 'cancer', 'FBI.Unusual', 'Suspects', 'go', 'back', '1989', 'discover', 'how', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'came', 'be.Detour', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'investigate', 'disappearance', 'man', 'Florida', 'good', 'one', 'liners', 'out.Christmas', 'Carol', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Scully', 'phone', 'call', 'Sim', 'residence', 'where', 'child', 'be', 'dead', 'sisters.Emily', 'Scully', 'out', 'Emily', 'fact', 'daughter', 'shetries', 'protect', 'someone', 'out', 'kill', 'her.Kitsunegari', 'Robert', 'Pusher', 'Modell', 'escaped', 'psych', 'ward', 'toying', 'Mulder', 'mind.Bad', 'Blood', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'argue', 'events', 'what', 'happened', 'Texas', 'Very', 'funny.Patient', 'X', 'alien', 'abductee', 'Scully', 'beginning', 'believe', 'aliens.The', 'Red', 'Black', 'Scully', 'faceless', 'bridge', 'Mulder', 'try', 'uncover', 'truth.Pine', 'Bluff', 'Variant', 'Mulder', 'tries', 'stop', 'man', 'spreading', 'deadly', 'virus', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'part', 'it.The', 'End', 'near', 'assassination', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'leads', 'Mulder', 'stunning', 'conclusion', 'could', 'be', 'ultimate', 'proof', 'extraterrestrial', 'life.The', 'fifth', 'season', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'season', 'hilarious', 'self', 'parody', 'episode', 'Bad', 'Blood', 'people', 'seem', 'forget', 'season', 'five', 'home', 'best', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'series']",The X-Files - The Complete Fifth Season
691621,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000060OFU,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","What is astonishing in looking back at the first five seasons of THE X-FILES is how amazingly consistent the show was. With most shows you can clearly demarcate the better from the worst seasons, but this show hit the ground running in its first season and never really eased up. Apart from adding touches of comedy in Season Three, the first five seasons are masterpieces of consistency. Over the course of time the show managed to build up a massive back-story, often leaping back a few decades to detail events in the past (including an excellent episode that not only deals with Mulder's father, but pays homage to one of the few shows that could be a precursor to THE X-FILES by guest starring THE NIGHT STALKER's leading man Darren McGavin). There are a number of outstanding stand alone episodes, and several that I personally find scarier than anything in the first four seasons. One early episode finds Mulder and Scully lost in a swamp with chameleon-like creatures that can strike almost at will (with more of the flirtation that left fans wondering if there was potential romance in the wings). Another very funny episode in black and white deals with ""The Great Mutato,"" a take off on bad 1950s Sci-fi films. But the best comic episode of the season is easily one set in Texas with Luke Wilson and vampires, a RASHOMON type story in which we witness the same story first from Scully's and then from Mulder's point of view (the former presenting Luke Wilson as the apex of male attractiveness, while Mulder presents him as a doofus with buck teeth and possibly some idiocy in the family line). There is also an amazing episode with Lily Taylor guest starring as a blind woman who has the ability to see things remotely through the eyes of the man who biologically fathered her.As with the former seasons, the most engrossing parts of the season dealt with ongoing plot lines. Season Four ended with Mulder apparently dead (though who really believed that?) and Scully in desperate shape because of her cancer). After a very, very funny first episode that provided comic relief after the cliffhanger ending of Season Four as well as dealing with both the creation of the Lone Gunmen and Mulder's involvement with the X-Files. And in an absolutely stunning episode sequence Scully, who was rendered barren by the procedures performed upon her during her abduction, discovers that she has a child that she is the genetic mother of. The Smoking Man is revealed to be Mulder's father, but then later not to be Mulder's father. Or perhaps Mulder's father, and the father of both his brother and his sister, or perhaps not. Just who Cancer Man fathered is a complex mystery at the end of Season Five. We get endless amounts of increased by increasingly unilluminating details about government conspiracies and plots. As I've pointed out in previous reviews, this highlights the only real weakness the show ever had: a tendency to pile one mysterious plot element onto another without resolving previous ones, and introducing apparently conflicting plot details, as the Smoking Man's role as potential father demonstrates. Unfortunately, subsequent seasons did less to resolve these tensions than to multiply them.The season ends with a wonderful episode about a small child with psychic ability who Mulder and Scully (and Mulder's old flame, played by Mimi Rogers), the most intense heightening tease hitherto that Mulder and Scully might have feelings for one another that their professional relationship has forced them to ignore (more in a second), and the reappearance of the Smoking Man who not only steals the child but sets fire to Mulder and Scully's office, destroying the X-Files. The final image of the season consists of an utterly despondent Mulder laying on his couch with a solicitous Scully sadly watching over him. Nonetheless, fans wanting to see something happen between Mulder and Scully were encouraged by the words of the boy who tells Mulder with both Scully and Mimi Rogers's character present that one of the two women was thinking about him, and that he was thinking about one of them, and also by the look of implied emotional devastation (which she typically refuses to express) when Scully walks by a door and sees Mulder and her old flame holding hands. Though the X-Files are ashes, the viewer still feels that Season Six will not only begin with the X-Files being resurrected, but with Mulder and Scully, whom we all assume were thinking of one another, might finally be coaxed to break the cold reserve that exists between them.",5,Another season of consistently brilliant story telling,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,4566,"['What', 'astonishing', 'looking', 'back', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'X-FILES', 'how', 'amazingly', 'consistent', 'show', 'was', 'most', 'shows', 'can', 'clearly', 'demarcate', 'better', 'worst', 'seasons', 'show', 'hit', 'ground', 'running', 'first', 'season', 'never', 'really', 'eased', 'up', 'Apart', 'adding', 'touches', 'comedy', 'Season', 'Three', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'consistency', 'course', 'time', 'show', 'managed', 'build', 'up', 'massive', 'back-story', 'often', 'leaping', 'back', 'few', 'decades', 'detail', 'events', 'past', 'including', 'excellent', 'episode', 'not', 'only', 'deals', 'Mulder', 'father', 'homage', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'could', 'be', 'precursor', 'X-FILES', 'guest', 'starring', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'STALKER', 'leading', 'man', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'are', 'number', 'outstanding', 'stand', 'alone', 'several', 'personally', 'find', 'scarier', 'anything', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'One', 'early', 'episode', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'lost', 'swamp', 'chameleon-like', 'creatures', 'can', 'strike', 'almost', 'will', 'more', 'flirtation', 'left', 'fans', 'wondering', 'was', 'potential', 'romance', 'wings', 'very', 'funny', 'episode', 'black', 'white', 'deals', 'Great', 'Mutato', 'take', 'off', 'bad', '1950s', 'Sci-fi', 'films', 'best', 'comic', 'episode', 'season', 'easily', 'one', 'set', 'Texas', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'vampires', 'RASHOMON', 'type', 'story', 'witness', 'same', 'story', 'first', 'Scully', 'then', 'Mulder', 'point', 'view', 'former', 'presenting', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'apex', 'male', 'attractiveness', 'Mulder', 'doofus', 'buck', 'teeth', 'possibly', 'idiocy', 'family', 'line', 'also', 'amazing', 'episode', 'Lily', 'Taylor', 'guest', 'starring', 'blind', 'woman', 'who', 'ability', 'see', 'things', 'remotely', 'eyes', 'man', 'who', 'biologically', 'fathered', 'her.As', 'former', 'seasons', 'most', 'engrossing', 'parts', 'season', 'dealt', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'lines', 'Season', 'Four', 'ended', 'Mulder', 'apparently', 'dead', 'who', 'really', 'believed', 'Scully', 'desperate', 'shape', 'cancer', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'first', 'episode', 'provided', 'comic', 'relief', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'Season', 'Four', 'as', 'well', 'dealing', 'creation', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'Mulder', 'involvement', 'X-Files', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'episode', 'sequence', 'Scully', 'who', 'was', 'rendered', 'barren', 'procedures', 'performed', 'abduction', 'discovers', 'child', 'genetic', 'mother', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'revealed', 'be', 'Mulder', 'father', 'then', 'later', 'not', 'be', 'Mulder', 'father', 'perhaps', 'Mulder', 'father', 'father', 'brother', 'sister', 'perhaps', 'not', 'Just', 'who', 'Cancer', 'Man', 'fathered', 'complex', 'mystery', 'end', 'Season', 'Five', 'get', 'endless', 'amounts', 'increased', 'increasingly', 'unilluminating', 'details', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'plots', ""'ve"", 'pointed', 'out', 'previous', 'reviews', 'only', 'real', 'weakness', 'show', 'ever', 'had', 'tendency', 'pile', 'one', 'mysterious', 'plot', 'element', 'resolving', 'previous', 'ones', 'introducing', 'apparently', 'conflicting', 'plot', 'details', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'role', 'potential', 'father', 'Unfortunately', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'did', 'less', 'resolve', 'tensions', 'multiply', 'them.The', 'season', 'wonderful', 'episode', 'small', 'child', 'psychic', 'ability', 'who', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'old', 'flame', 'played', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'most', 'intense', 'heightening', 'tease', 'hitherto', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'might', 'have', 'feelings', 'one', 'professional', 'relationship', 'forced', 'ignore', 'more', 'second', 'reappearance', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'child', 'sets', 'fire', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'office', 'destroying', 'X-Files', 'final', 'image', 'season', 'utterly', 'despondent', 'Mulder', 'laying', 'couch', 'solicitous', 'Scully', 'sadly', 'watching', 'Nonetheless', 'fans', 'wanting', 'see', 'something', 'happen', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'were', 'encouraged', 'words', 'boy', 'who', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'character', 'present', 'one', 'two', 'women', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'thinking', 'one', 'also', 'look', 'implied', 'emotional', 'devastation', 'typically', 'express', 'when', 'Scully', 'walks', 'door', 'sees', 'Mulder', 'old', 'flame', 'holding', 'hands', 'X-Files', 'are', 'ashes', 'viewer', 'still', 'Season', 'Six', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'begin', 'X-Files', 'being', 'resurrected', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'whom', 'assume', 'were', 'thinking', 'one', 'might', 'finally', 'be', 'coaxed', 'break', 'cold', 'reserve']",The X-Files - The Complete Fifth Season

It's a Scully-centric season and Anderson gets lots of red meat to sink her teeth into. Her character has an episode-long death bed scene (""Redux II""), discovers by way of her murdered sister that she has a human-alien hybrid daughter (""Christmas Carol/Emily""), is nearly immolated by alien rebels (""Patient X""), experiences yet another test of faith (""All Souls"") and, for part of the season, gets to play believer to Mulder's skeptic. She is superb. As is David Duchovny who probably deserved an Emmy of his own. And the two have never looked better. Both are stunningly beautiful (great hair, terrific wardrobe, primo physical condition) as they prepare for filming their big screen X-Files debut.In season 5, we learn about the origins of the Lone Gunmen (""Unusual Suspects"") and meet Diana Fowley, the woman we loved to hate (""The End""). There is also one of the more cogent explorations and advancements of the show's convoluted mythology (""Patient X"" and ""The Red and the Black""). And a beautifully filmed (in black and white) fractured fairy tale that's both funny and touching (""The Post-Modern Prometheus""). It also features the return of Pusher (""Kitsunegari"") with a twist and although this episode is not nearly as good as the original, it was fun to have him back.Season 5 features some excellent guest star turns, most notably from Lili Taylor, Veronica Cartwright and Mimi Rogers. We also get scripts from fanboi Stephen King (""Chinga"") and science fiction writers William Gibson and Tom Maddox (""Kill Switch""). I found the King episode derivative and disappointing (as apparently did Chris Carter who reportedly had to beef it up--can you imagine) but I did find his take on the Mulder/Scully dynamic interesting. Of the two episodes, ""Kill Switch"" is far and away the better.All-in-all, a most excellent season. Imaginative, well written, well produced, well acted.

The info book has quotes, chapter stops, images, & other info for all the episodes.Here are some of the best episodes. Redux 1&2: mulder has shot himself? No, he is actually searching for a cure for Scully's cancer. He has also lost his belief in the validity of aliens. He now thinks they are just a government cover for something more sinister. Surprise, ""Cigarette Smoking Man"" is shot!Unusual Suspects: A back in time sequence where Mulder meets & becomes friends with the lone gunmen, a very well paced episode.Detour: Scully & Mulder are hunted through the woods by a camoflaged humanoid being.Christmas Carol/Emily: Scully helps someone & comes across a suicide that may actually be a murder? She later finds a dying girl who may be related to her? While Mulder tries to find information on her condition while Scully fights to keep her alive.Schizogeny: is nature killing people? Are the abusive parents reaping what they sowed? A good suspense thriller.Bad Blood: Mulder kills a vampire. They get sued while each agent tells the story from very different perspectives. A dark, goofy episode.Patient X & The Black Oil: Jeff spender & his mother Cassandra are introduced. She is a multiple abductee, & her son is full of surprises. while the ever devious Krycek faces the syndicate over the vaccine to the Black oil.Travelers: a flashback episode where Arthur Dales appears. This may have been the best episode of the season?All Souls: some deformed girls are struck down in identical ways, while Scully deals with her tormented emotions over Emily's loss. A true sci-fi classic.Pine Bluff Variant: has Mulder gone bad? I won't tell, just watch this one.The End: The mind reading boy Gibson Praise appears. As the boy is hunted {by who?} the drama grows. An exceptional episode with many twists. There could have been more extras, but this is still a fine collection from a five star show.",5,"An Intimate Season.

Boomer ""Boomer""","[0, 1]","So for those of you who are hungry for really good sci-fi, there is a lot to choose from, but there is not a lot that really satisfies. X-Files has a lot of dumb episodes that I believe were intentionally created to let the public know that &#34;hey this is a TV show! It is not real!&#34;Why did they have to do that? Because the good episodes are SOOO intense and SOOO good that people start believing it is real. Many there are who want to believe in conspiracy theories, but for the rest of us we just want to be entertained by something really good. This is it. X-Files really starts getting good in Season 3, but by Season 5 they are in full stride andunstoppable.David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson compliment each other in their roles as Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, both in demeanor and opposite points of view. The most endearing part of their relationship is the DEEP trust and mutual respect they have in each other. This trust is well founded as both partners faithfully and rabidly defend the other in every way. They repeatedly profess to each other how there is no one else in the world that they trust. As long as they are true to their faith in each other, it seems that they are able to overcome anything. There really is nothing so romantic as the way they repeatedly come through for each other in Season 5.Season 5 builds tension that leads up to the first X Files movie which occurs between Seasons 5 and 6. The story is as intense as the unspoken love between Scully and Mulder.I have rediscovered the X Files and retrospect, I think it is possible that this is some of the best sci-fi in terms of character development, plot development, suspense, and real characters that you grow to care about.

691632,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000060OFU,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[21, 22]","The last season shot in Vancouver has some of the finest episodes of the series. While the show would slip a couple of notches in quality with succeeding years, the fifth season still shows the production staff and actors in top form. The fifth season features one of my favorite episodes ""The Pine Bluff Variant"" about a group of U.S. terrorist that modify a bioagent produced by the military to kill rapidly and that can be passed on common objects. It's got a frightening opening that chills not just because of the drama but also because it reflects the fantatical insanity of terrorism. Excellent performances abound in this terrific episode written by John Shiban and the taunt direction is worthy of a feature film.""Kill Switch"" by author William Gibson is a mind bending episode where Mulder gets jacked into a computer that wants...information from him. It reminds me of ""The Prisoner"" in many respects with a new sheen applied. I've never seen the original script for Stephen King's ""Chinga"" but it's undoubtably the most disappointing episode here and the weakest. it recycles an idea that was old even when writer Charlues Beaumont scripted it for the original ""Twilight Zone"". I'm not sure how Carter revised the script (if he did at all or if it was more collaboration)but it would point to some of the shortcomings in future seasons--recycling older ideas and not doing it very well. Carter's homage to old horror movies ""The Post Modern Prometheus"" shot in stark black and white images that recall ""Bride of Frankenstein"" and ""Son of Frankenstein"" with its use of surreal set designs and impressionistic lighting is an example of style succeding when there isn't enough substance. Directed by Carter the look and feel of the episode (as well as the performances) carry a script that is OK if a bit deliberate and heavy handed. Still, it's one of the best looking episodes the show produced. ""Emily"" the second part of a two part episode in which Scully gets a call from her deceased sister saying ""She needs you"" is touching. It's an example of ""The X-Files"" at its best--emotionally honest yet dealing with complex issues and a great story. The first part ""Christmas Carol"" is equally as good but the conclusion of ""Emily"" is heartbreaking and has the edge of the two.The humourous ""Detour"" is a great stand alone episode. A fan favorite returns in ""Kitsunegari"" with Pusher returning. The marvelous Robert Modell returns (why doesn't this guy appear on TV more and someone, please, get him a TV series or cast him in a major movie. The last time I saw him was in ""Battlestar Galatica"" last year). The humorous ""Bad Blood"" is another superior episode about a vampire on the loose in a small town. Mulder and Scully have very different memories of the circumstances and when each tells the story from their point of view the contradictions are hillarious. ""Mind's Eye"" was an episode I missed during the series original run and didn't see it until the DVDs were released. It's a great episode with strong performances about a blind woman who is implicated in a series of murders. The solution is surprising (or was to me) and powerful.A great set the show will looks the same here as the previous boxed set because Fox is using the same digital masters and transfers for this set. As to extras will if commentary tracks, deleted scenes and anything on the disks with the episodes will be included but the bonus disk of extras (the game, featurettes, etc.) will not. You won't miss them trust me on this.

691634,AP3B615GM191G,B000060OFU,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","During the previous four seasons of The X-Files, a similar theme was followed in all of the show's ""mythology"" (or over-arching) episodes: Agent Mulder is the unshakeable believer in aliens, while Agent Scully is the staunch skeptic.  In this Fifth Season, that formula is thrown out the window.  Let's quickly examine the three types of X-Files episodes in order to see where the show deviates from that traditional pattern:Mythology: Picking up from the shocking (yet rather anticlimatic, as you known Mulder really won't be killed off) Season Four finale, in ""Redux"" and ""Redux II"" Mulder is given a completely different interpretation about his paranormal findings at that point, perhaps debasing his entire life's work.  Later this season (in ""Patient X"" and ""The Red and the Black"") Mulder remains skeptical while Scully is drawn (in a very personal way) towards a very Mulder-like paranormal explanation of certain events.  Eventually, in ""The End"", Mulder is again convinced of the continued existance of extraterrestrial life, but that realization is ultimately too late in coming to prevent a terrible catastrophe from striking the X-Files.Also, ""Christmas Carol"" and ""Emily"" are the first Scully-based mythology episodes on the show, in which Scully discovers more information regarding her earlier abduction.  While some X-Files fans (including myself) believe that Scully has a difficult time carrying an episode that does not also heavily involve Mulder, other fans find these two episodes to pack a heavy emotional punch.Stand-Alone: As usual, the quality of the stand-alone X-Files episodes this season is quite high.  ""The Post-Modern Prometheus"" is my favorite stand-alone episode of the entire show, ""Kitsunegari"" marks the return of an old nemesis, and ""Chinga"" (penned by master writer Stephen King) has you on the edge of your seat.  Also, ""All Souls"" provides a much deeper and fascinating look into Scully's religious battles than has every been provided before.Comedic: This season, only ""Bad Blood"" could be considered a true X-Files comedy episode.  Even so, it does not disappoint, rivaling ""Jose Chung"" of the Third Season for funniest episode in the show's history.To conclude, the Fifth Season of the X-Files throws a wrench into the seemingly established beliefs of the show's past.  While the Scully plotlines are hit-or-miss depending on who you ask, the torment of Agent Mulder in trying to piece together one truth out of multiple lies will have you rooting for his cause harder than ever.  The final scene of the season will leave your jaw on the floor, wondering how the show can ever be the same.",5,The Bedrock Is Shaken,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,2635,"['previous', 'four', 'seasons', 'X-Files', 'similar', 'theme', 'was', 'followed', 'show', 'mythology', 'over-arching', 'Agent', 'Mulder', 'unshakeable', 'believer', 'aliens', 'Agent', 'Scully', 'staunch', 'skeptic', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'formula', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'Let', 'quickly', 'examine', 'three', 'types', 'X-Files', 'episodes', 'order', 'see', 'where', 'show', 'traditional', 'pattern', 'Mythology', 'Picking', 'up', 'shocking', 'yet', 'rather', 'anticlimatic', 'known', 'Mulder', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'killed', 'off', 'Season', 'Four', 'finale', 'Redux', 'Redux', 'II', 'Mulder', 'given', 'completely', 'different', 'interpretation', 'paranormal', 'findings', 'point', 'perhaps', 'debasing', 'entire', 'life', 'work', 'Later', 'season', 'Patient', 'X', 'Red', 'Black', 'Mulder', 'skeptical', 'Scully', 'drawn', 'very', 'personal', 'way', 'very', 'Mulder-like', 'paranormal', 'explanation', 'certain', 'events', 'Eventually', 'End', 'Mulder', 'again', 'convinced', 'continued', 'existance', 'extraterrestrial', 'life', 'realization', 'ultimately', 'too', 'late', 'coming', 'prevent', 'terrible', 'catastrophe', 'striking', 'X-Files.Also', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Emily', 'are', 'first', 'Scully-based', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'show', 'Scully', 'more', 'information', 'regarding', 'earlier', 'abduction', 'X-Files', 'fans', 'including', 'believe', 'Scully', 'difficult', 'time', 'carrying', 'episode', 'not', 'also', 'heavily', 'involve', 'Mulder', 'other', 'fans', 'find', 'two', 'episodes', 'pack', 'heavy', 'emotional', 'punch.Stand-Alone', 'usual', 'quality', 'stand-alone', 'X-Files', 'season', 'quite', 'high', 'Post-Modern', 'Prometheus', 'favorite', 'stand-alone', 'episode', 'entire', 'show', 'Kitsunegari', 'return', 'old', 'nemesis', 'Chinga', 'penned', 'master', 'writer', 'Stephen', 'King', 'edge', 'seat', 'Also', 'Souls', 'much', 'deeper', 'fascinating', 'look', 'Scully', 'religious', 'battles', 'been', 'provided', 'before.Comedic', 'season', 'only', 'Bad', 'Blood', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'true', 'X-Files', 'comedy', 'episode', 'Even', 'so', 'not', 'disappoint', 'rivaling', 'Jose', 'Chung', 'Third', 'Season', 'funniest', 'episode', 'show', 'history.To', 'conclude', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'X-Files', 'wrench', 'seemingly', 'established', 'beliefs', 'show', 'past', 'Scully', 'plotlines', 'are', 'hit-or-miss', 'depending', 'who', 'ask', 'torment', 'Agent', 'Mulder', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'one', 'truth', 'multiple', 'lies', 'will', 'have', 'rooting', 'cause', 'harder', 'ever', 'final', 'scene', 'season', 'will', 'leave', 'jaw', 'floor', 'wondering', 'how', 'show', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'same']",The X-Files - The Complete Fifth Season
