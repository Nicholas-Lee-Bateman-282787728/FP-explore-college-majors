734086,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B000085EFJ,A Customer,"[0, 0]","Story summary:Alex Scott (Owen Wilson) is a secret agent for an American investigative service.  He has a tendency to screw up investigations but somehow still get the job done.  Kelly Robinson (Eddie Murphy) is a world champion boxer that has never lost a professional fight.  Of course this has left him with an ego larger than Asia and lots of money.  Because he is unbeatable in America he agrees to an international bout in Hungary.It just so happens that the U.S. has recently developed a new spy plane called Switchblade that has the ability to become invisible to the naked eye.  International arms dealer Arnold Gundars (Malcolm McDowell) has stolen the plane and is using the boxing fight as a cover to bring international buyers to Hungary to sell the plane.For some reason the president decides that Kelly Robinson should help Alex Scott get the plane back.  So, Kelly and Alex are teamed up against Arnold as they go through a series of adventures trying to get the plane back.My comments:Despite having two very funny, comedic actors, both which I like very much, this movie just isn't that funny.  The problem isn't with the actors but with the story.  There are virtually no original ideas in this story.  The team up of this action/comedy duo, a boxer with an agent, is virtually identical to the team up of Jackie Chan, a martial arts expert, with Chris Rock, a detective that can never get things right.  There is also nothing particularly new about a secret weapon that has been stolen (Cradle 2 the Grave, Mission Impossible 2, Triple XXX etc.) that if placed in the wrong hands will result in mass destruction.  So, the story is pathetically unoriginal.The movie is also kind of slow.  The 20 minutes on top of the bridge where the plane has been stored for the last week involve so many reversals and twists that by the end you find yourself wishing they'd all just jump off and end your misery.Despite the rampant problems, there are a couple of good things about the movie.  Murphy and Wilson are kind of funny, but their humor is spread out far too much.  There are a couple of scenes that are actually particularly funny, like the two of them being trapped in the sewer.  But comedic scenes like this are followed up by non-sensical scenes like Alex's blow up at Robinson while walking back to their base which results in Robinson's arrest - it had no relevance to the rest of the story and didn't really seem to impact the story other than to get Alex alone.Overall, the movie is good for some cheap laughs but doesn't deliver on a unique story or concept.  If you like Owen Wilson and/or Eddie Murphy this is worth seeing, but it doesn't really stand out as a comedic achievement.",2,"Kind of funny, but overall lame.",1055635200,"06 15, 2003",2003,2709,"['Story', 'summary', 'Alex', 'Scott', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'secret', 'agent', 'American', 'investigative', 'service', 'tendency', 'screw', 'up', 'investigations', 'somehow', 'still', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Kelly', 'Robinson', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'world', 'champion', 'boxer', 'never', 'lost', 'professional', 'fight', 'course', 'left', 'ego', 'larger', 'Asia', 'lots', 'money', 'unbeatable', 'America', 'international', 'bout', 'Hungary.It', 'just', 'so', 'U.S.', 'recently', 'developed', 'new', 'spy', 'plane', 'called', 'Switchblade', 'ability', 'become', 'invisible', 'naked', 'eye', 'International', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Arnold', 'Gundars', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'stolen', 'plane', 'using', 'boxing', 'fight', 'cover', 'bring', 'international', 'buyers', 'Hungary', 'sell', 'plane.For', 'reason', 'president', 'Kelly', 'Robinson', 'should', 'help', 'Alex', 'Scott', 'get', 'plane', 'back', 'So', 'Kelly', 'Alex', 'are', 'teamed', 'up', 'Arnold', 'go', 'series', 'adventures', 'trying', 'get', 'plane', 'back.My', 'comments', 'having', 'two', 'very', 'funny', 'comedic', 'actors', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'funny', 'problem', ""n't"", 'actors', 'story', 'are', 'virtually', 'original', 'ideas', 'story', 'team', 'up', 'action/comedy', 'duo', 'boxer', 'agent', 'virtually', 'identical', 'team', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'martial', 'arts', 'expert', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'detective', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'things', 'right', 'also', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'new', 'secret', 'weapon', 'been', 'stolen', 'Cradle', '2', 'Grave', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'Triple', 'XXX', 'etc', 'placed', 'wrong', 'hands', 'will', 'result', 'mass', 'destruction', 'So', 'story', 'pathetically', 'unoriginal.The', 'movie', 'also', 'kind', 'slow', '20', 'minutes', 'top', 'bridge', 'where', 'plane', 'been', 'stored', 'last', 'week', 'involve', 'so', 'many', 'reversals', 'twists', 'end', 'find', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'just', 'jump', 'off', 'end', 'rampant', 'problems', 'are', 'couple', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'Murphy', 'Wilson', 'are', 'kind', 'funny', 'humor', 'spread', 'out', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'particularly', 'funny', 'two', 'being', 'trapped', 'sewer', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'are', 'followed', 'up', 'non-sensical', 'scenes', 'Alex', 'blow', 'up', 'Robinson', 'walking', 'back', 'base', 'results', 'Robinson', 'arrest', 'had', 'relevance', 'rest', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'impact', 'story', 'other', 'get', 'Alex', 'alone.Overall', 'movie', 'good', 'cheap', 'laughs', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'unique', 'story', 'concept', 'like', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'and/or', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'worth', 'seeing', ""n't"", 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'comedic', 'achievement']",N/A

The fact remains that this film doesn't really offer a whole lot.  The plot is a mere throwaway (a lazy mix of nearly every other `spy oriented' film plot) but the comedic timing and likable performances make this at least watchable.  In fact, Murphy has a way of making this film kind of funny.Like I said, the plot itself doesn't always work (I like the way this site phrases it, that it works in isolated segments but doesn't come together coherently, because that is how I feel about it myself) but you will laugh.  Murphy plays Kelly, an over-confident athlete who gets a little in over his head (although he doesn't see it that way) when he's prompted to help Alex, a dedicated yet `green' government agent.  Kelly has a boxing match scheduled that will allow him direct access to Arnold Gundars, a lethal arms dealer who is suspected of stealing a stealth fighter.  Alex isn't too keen on working with Kelly, but he's too busy pining over the leggy Rachel to really understand the gravity of his situation.Murphy and Wilson feed off one another very well here, and there is no denying that Famke Janssen can light any man's fire.  I do wish they made better use of Malcolm McDowell (he deserved a much better career than he was dealt), who rather phones it in as the token `villain'.I haven't seen the original television series, so I'm not really sure how it compares.This is far from the best action-buddy-comedy out there, but if it happens to be on your cable-box there is no shame in indulging on a rainy (lazy) afternoon.  There are some intense sequences, and the banter between Wilson and Murphy goes a long way (about as long as it can go, really).  I wouldn't rush out to own this film (I do own it, but that's another story), but it's certainly enjoyable when watched in the frame of mind.

I SPY sees the reteaming of Eddie Murphy with DR. DOLITTLE director Betty Thomas. Based on the 60s TV show starring Robert Culp and Ozzy Osbourne's #1 fan, Bill Cosby; this update sees Murphy stepping into Culp's role and Owen Wilson in place of Cosby.The plot: Arnold Gundars (Malcolm McDowell) is an illegal arms dealer who has stolen The Switchblade, a top secret government spy plane equipped with an invisible cloaking device which he plans to sell to the highest bidder.Special Agent Alex Scott (Wilson) is assigned the task of retrieving the plane and arresting Gundars, but  finds himself reluctantly partnered with Kelly Robinson (Murphy) World Middleweight Boxing Champ and egomaniac who always refers to himself in the third person. So his line ""My Grandmother was the first person that punched me in the face"" should be ""Kelly Robinson's Grandmother was the first person that punched Kelly Robinson in the face"". How about some script coherance?  The duo are assisted by sexy Secret Agent, Rachel Wright (Famke Janssen) who may also be a double agent, and  to whom Scott finds himself attracted, which makes the situation more complicated (Who can blame him? I've been a fan of Famke's since she strangled that old geezer with her thighs in GOLDENEYE).I SPY is a movie that's predictable, but still entertaining in spite of itself. Murphy and Wilson help raise it a few notches with their banter and in addition there are also some good action sequences. What I don't understand is why trained spies would need the help of the World Middleweight Boxing Champ to find a stolen plane! Don't bother searching for a logical explaination.That said, this is still far superior to Murphy's previous effort PLUTO NASH.

734097,A103KNDW8GN92L,B000085EFJ,David Hugaert,"[1, 1]","Upon seeing the trailer/preview of ""I Spy"", I thought to myself: ""Hey, since this picture stars Eddie Murphy, it should be funny as hell"". Well, after seeing it first-run, I'm not all that impressed for any number of reasons: First off, the dialogue between Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson was watered down, with the script lacking direction - making it difficult to understand the storyline in places. Furthermore, I thought much of the dialogue between Murphy's and Wilson's characters did not play off one another very well at all, which made me ponder whether or not this movie was worth plunking down any foreseeable amount of cold hard cash for. Many of the actors portrayed here looked as if they were just going through the motions and it looked as if a majority of them didn't enjoy being involved in the making of this sort-of average film. The worst part of ""I Spy"" is that the main actors (Murphy and Wilson) weren't the ""real"" stars of this movie. That honor rightfully goes to Malcolm McDowell (and would you believe in a supporting role?), whose portrayal of a really down and dirty bad guy definitely keeps ""I Spy"" from being a total wash-out. The other ""star"" worthy of mention here is the old-world scenery of Budapest, Hungary - featuring much scenic beauty this film desperately needed from being a total snoozefest. As for the dramatic side of this film, there's some ""rock and sock 'em"" action scenes that work to a degree, but even those come across as being half-hearted attempts at sheer machoism, while making their mark at being really mediocre at the same time. Also, before making an investment in seeing this remake of the classic Bill Cosby/Robert Culp TV series, I figured there'd be laughs-a-plenty from Eddie Murphy, but it appears as if he's still in a deeply-meditated funk, and hasn't had a good starring role since 1997's ""Metro"", which is twice as good as ""I Spy"", according to this humble reviewer's opinion. Murphy's ""black"" comedy routine usually works in a majority of Eddie's movies, comedies in particular, but unfortunately, there's very little comedy to be found here. It would be wise to stick to watching reruns of the classic Cosby/Culp TV series (that is, if you're lucky enough to spot it on cable!), and stay (a good distance) away from this statement of mediocrity, for the most part. You'll find there are more productive and entertaining ways of spending your hard-earned bread. But, if you really want to see ""I Spy"" (the movie, that is), it would be most wise to wait until it is released on either VHS or DVD for rent.

In the case of ""I Spy"" though, the whole concept is completely ruined and pounded down to a bloody pulp by atrocious acting and lack of chemistry by all of the cast.The story of the movie is of a new technological breakthrough of where a special type of fighter jet is designed to turn invisible. The jet and possibly the technology is stolen by a terrorist mastermind and two bumbling FBI agents named Alex Scott (Owen Wilson) and Kelly Robinson (Eddie Murphy) are assigned on a mission to recover the jet and hunt down the terrorists before they use the jet to deliver a weapon of mass destruction on a major city.The fact that they try to make the film into a comedy though throws a lot of the potential right out the window and in the case of terrorist movies, making them into comedies ruins their quality and ""I Spy"" falls into this category. Everyone in the cast fares poorly. Owen Wilson's role as Alex Scott in unconvincing and almost annoying. Wilson has done much better than this! Eddie Murphy's role in this mocie is much more despicable because apart from Dr Doolittles I & II, his movies have gone downhill in quality over the past five years and he reached his all-time low with the abysmal ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" but he improved somewhat with ""I Spy"" but still misfires anyway. Famke Janssen as Rachel Wright was completely unsexy and the character was almost repulsive in my opinion, looking more like a drugged out hooker on the streets than a special agent gone bad. It isn't so much that the actors and actresses are talentless, quite the contrary, but they all look uncomfortable and bored in their performances.Overall, this movie could've been so much better and much more engaging but their attempts at trying to make it into a more comedy-oriented movie just reduced it to useless pap headed for the recycling bin. This movie tries to be funny and induce laughs but I found myself slumping in my chair from boredom and humorless reaction to the action scenes and jokes and by the time it was over, ""I Spy"" left nothing behind in me. Even if I scraped up all of the funny moments, they only amount to maybe 10 minutes in my opinion with 80+ minutes of boredom.When it comes to spy action movies, I'd suggest Vin Diesel's ""xXx"" instead. In terms of more comedy-oriented movies, I suggest the ""Rush Hour"" movies instead. These three movies make great counterpoints to each other. ""I Spy"" tries to combine the theme of these movies but strips away the laughter of ""Rush Hour"" and the attention grabbing action sequences of ""xXx"". I'm not saying that this movie was terrible but I found ""I Spy"" to be one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in quite a long time and was glad to finally pop in ""Rush Hour"" and hopefully have two hours of extended longevity to make up for the wasted time ""I Spy"" caused me.",2,One of the most dissapointing movies in a long time. :-(,1051142400,"04 24, 2003",2003,3095,"['could', 'as', 'well', 'consider', 'Spy', 'be', 'one', 'dullest', 'comedy/action', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'long', 'time.The', 'whole', 'idea', 'new', 'technology', 'make', 'fighter', 'jet', 'invisible', 'falling', 'hands', 'terrorist', 'masterminds', 'quite', 'interesting', 'case', 'Spy', 'whole', 'concept', 'completely', 'ruined', 'pounded', 'down', 'bloody', 'pulp', 'atrocious', 'acting', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'cast.The', 'story', 'movie', 'new', 'technological', 'breakthrough', 'where', 'special', 'type', 'fighter', 'jet', 'designed', 'turn', 'invisible', 'jet', 'possibly', 'technology', 'stolen', 'terrorist', 'mastermind', 'two', 'bumbling', 'FBI', 'agents', 'named', 'Alex', 'Scott', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Kelly', 'Robinson', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'are', 'assigned', 'mission', 'recover', 'jet', 'hunt', 'down', 'terrorists', 'use', 'jet', 'deliver', 'weapon', 'mass', 'destruction', 'major', 'city.The', 'fact', 'try', 'make', 'film', 'comedy', 'lot', 'potential', 'right', 'window', 'case', 'terrorist', 'movies', 'making', 'comedies', 'ruins', 'quality', 'Spy', 'category', 'Everyone', 'cast', 'poorly', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'role', 'Alex', 'Scott', 'unconvincing', 'almost', 'annoying', 'Wilson', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'role', 'mocie', 'much', 'more', 'despicable', 'apart', 'Dr', 'Doolittles', 'II', 'movies', 'have', 'gone', 'downhill', 'quality', 'past', 'five', 'years', 'reached', 'all-time', 'low', 'abysmal', 'Adventures', 'Pluto', 'Nash', 'improved', 'somewhat', 'Spy', 'still', 'anyway', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Rachel', 'Wright', 'was', 'completely', 'unsexy', 'character', 'was', 'almost', 'repulsive', 'opinion', 'looking', 'more', 'drugged', 'out', 'hooker', 'streets', 'special', 'agent', 'gone', 'bad', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'talentless', 'contrary', 'look', 'uncomfortable', 'bored', 'performances.Overall', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'much', 'more', 'engaging', 'attempts', 'trying', 'make', 'more', 'comedy-oriented', 'movie', 'just', 'reduced', 'useless', 'pap', 'headed', 'recycling', 'bin', 'movie', 'be', 'funny', 'induce', 'laughs', 'found', 'slumping', 'chair', 'boredom', 'humorless', 'reaction', 'action', 'scenes', 'jokes', 'time', 'was', 'over', 'Spy', 'left', 'nothing', 'Even', 'scraped', 'up', 'funny', 'moments', 'only', 'amount', 'maybe', '10', 'minutes', 'opinion', '80+', 'minutes', 'boredom.When', 'spy', 'action', 'movies', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'xXx', 'instead', 'terms', 'more', 'comedy-oriented', 'movies', 'suggest', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'movies', 'instead', 'three', 'movies', 'make', 'great', 'counterpoints', 'other', 'Spy', 'combine', 'theme', 'movies', 'away', 'laughter', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'attention', 'grabbing', 'action', 'sequences', 'xXx', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'movie', 'was', 'terrible', 'found', 'Spy', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'disappointing', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'glad', 'finally', 'pop', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'hopefully', 'have', 'two', 'hours', 'extended', 'longevity', 'make', 'up', 'wasted', 'time', 'Spy', 'caused']",N/A

Even in 2002 he was in his forties. Comics like George Burns (referring to Gracie Allen) and Jerry Lewis have spoken of how the role on which their success was based was no longer accepted by the audience. They had to move on to win back the audience. Well, I don't imagine Eddie Murphy has lost his public, but, I, at least, find him too long in the tooth, as the saying  goes, for his approach.At any rate, in this film, I kept looking for the young guy it was designed for. Sure, nobody would expect an experienced actor like Murphy to play the part the way Bill Cosby did. Not only because they take completely different approaches as comics, but because Cosby was a completely inexperienced actor at the time he started the original series. It was easy for Culp,  a trained and experienced film actor, and him, to be the equals, the partners, that the scripts demanded. Here the script calls for  it, but the Murphy persona is what is supposed to bring in the audience and, given their styles, there is no way his partner can be seen as an equal. At least, I couldn't see them as such.There are some good action scenes and the usual rub-a-dub-dub of good guys and bad guys.

One of the boxers,Kelly Robinson(Eddie Murphey),is called by the president to help. ""America needs you."" he says. Kelly accepts and his job is to get Alex into the boxing party to track down the arms dealer. Alex's assitant is Racheal who is an agent that he's had a crush on for years. Akex's biggest rivial is Carlos who is a swarve Spanish spy who always gets the hignest spy gear. The men want to be like him and the women all want him. Alex get's jealous when he learns that Racheal and Carlos had a fling during a two week stakeout. With the help of Kelly, Alex tries to recover the Switchblade.The funniest parts in the movie are the scenes on Robinson's plane, the scene on top of the bridge, and the scene in which Robinson is helping Alex confess his secret to Racheal by telling him to say the lyrics to ""Sexual Healing.""

734105,A3L2U581LL17EB,B000085EFJ,Eric,"[1, 1]","The trailers for I Spy were pretty damn funny, and the movie starred Owen Wilson, a fine comic actor who continues to grow on me with each successive performance. So it's unfortunate I Spy ends up as nothing more than a second-rate action/comedy, severely lacking in thrills, spills, and belly laughs. Undiscriminating twelve-year olds will probably enjoy it, but for most everyone else, this is as routine as spy comedies get.Alex Scott (Owen Wilson) is a spy who's just been handed a new partner, Kelly Robinson (Eddy Murphy), a selfish, hot-headed, motor-mouthed boxer with a quick temper. Their assignment: to retrieve an important spy plane (which can camouflage, no less) that's about to be sold to terrorist bidders. There's also Famke Janssen as another secret agent whose only purpose here is to spice up the sex appeal (not that I'm complaining).I Spy's biggest and most glaring flaw is that it's just not very funny. Yes, there are a handful of laughs; I did like the scene where Wilson compared his equipment with another top spy's, and I also liked the scene where Wilson tried to woo Janssen. But aside from the plain fact much of the material isn't funny, the problem is also that there's no sense of continuity or balance; the jokes are thrown around without much care to whether it actually fits the moment, and this has quite a jarring and unpleasant effect on the movie's entertainment value.The action scenes, which often feel rather padded (much like some of the jokes), aren't any better. There are quite a few requisite chases, shootouts, and fights but the choreography is subpar and the action is so lightweight, you never get the feeling anyone's in danger in spite of the mounting body count. The story's pretty lame, it's all really just a bunch of comic and action setpieces strung together, which would be fine if those scenes worked, but they generally don't.In many ways, I Spy is a wildly schizophrenic film, never maintaining a consistency with its humor or thrills (or really genuinely delivering much of them), and the same goes with the performances. While Wilson is relatively likeable and charming, Eddie Murphy is just annoying, spending most of his screen time ranting about this and that, usually lines of dialogue that are unfunny and have absolutely nothing to do with the ""plot.""Directed by Betty Thomas, it's as if though she never had a firm grasp of the material, trying to put the film together as an action thriller/buddy comedy but never succeeding as either.

As to how much it actually as to do with the original other than similar names, I am not really certain.  Does it succeed on it's own?  Yes.Owen Wilson is Special Agent Alexander Scott.  He risks his life daily to save the world but is frequently treated by his cohorts at the mythical agency as somewhat of a foul-up in comparison to super spy, Carlos (played by Gary Cole).  On Scott's latest mission he discovers the whereabouts of the stolen spy plane, the Switchblade, before loosing the pilot.  Scott's agency decides to send him undercover in Budapest to retrieve the plane from the uber-villain played by Malcolm McDowell, Gundars.It seems Gundars is a fan of boxing so the agency places Scott undercover in the camp of middleweight champion, Kelly Robinson (played by Eddie Murphy).  Robinson is as fast-talking, cocky, and self absorbed as Scott is slower talking, uncertain of himself, and interested in only helping others.  Naturally the two mix like oil and water yet you know before the movie is out they will have become buddies to the end.The movie, as directed by Betty Thomas, is quite simply fun.  There is no pretense as seriousness here and that would have caused the movie to fail drastically.  It is frequently a take-off on the Bond series with Scott having the inferior gadgets to the super Carlos and the comic highjinks are evident throughout.  While I tend not to like Owen Wilson in roles that he is responsible for writing, when he collaborates with another star the results tend to be hilarious.  Putting him with Murphy was sheer genius.  The two play off of each other through the entire movie and I swear that there is nobody who could have written all the dialogue floating off the screen.  Sure, some of it fails but there are also sequences like that which occurs in the sewer which leaves the audience gasping for breath.It may be a re-make but that is not a reason to turn your nose up at this fine entry into the buddy-movie genre.",4,great chemistry makes the movie work,1036281600,"11 3, 2002",2002,2028,"['Spy', 'latest', 'remake', '1960s', 'television', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'actually', 'do', 'original', 'other', 'similar', 'names', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'certain', 'succeed', 'own', 'Yes.Owen', 'Wilson', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Alexander', 'Scott', 'life', 'daily', 'save', 'world', 'frequently', 'treated', 'cohorts', 'mythical', 'agency', 'somewhat', 'foul-up', 'comparison', 'super', 'spy', 'Carlos', 'played', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Scott', 'latest', 'mission', 'whereabouts', 'stolen', 'spy', 'plane', 'Switchblade', 'loosing', 'pilot', 'Scott', 'agency', 'send', 'undercover', 'Budapest', 'retrieve', 'plane', 'uber-villain', 'played', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Gundars.It', 'Gundars', 'fan', 'boxing', 'agency', 'places', 'Scott', 'undercover', 'camp', 'middleweight', 'champion', 'Kelly', 'Robinson', 'played', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Robinson', 'fast-talking', 'cocky', 'absorbed', 'Scott', 'slower', 'talking', 'uncertain', 'interested', 'only', 'helping', 'others', 'Naturally', 'two', 'mix', 'oil', 'water', 'yet', 'know', 'movie', 'out', 'will', 'have', 'become', 'buddies', 'end.The', 'movie', 'directed', 'Betty', 'Thomas', 'quite', 'simply', 'fun', 'pretense', 'seriousness', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'caused', 'movie', 'fail', 'drastically', 'frequently', 'take-off', 'Bond', 'series', 'Scott', 'having', 'inferior', 'gadgets', 'super', 'Carlos', 'comic', 'highjinks', 'are', 'evident', 'tend', 'not', 'like', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'roles', 'responsible', 'writing', 'when', 'star', 'results', 'tend', 'be', 'hilarious', 'Putting', 'Murphy', 'was', 'sheer', 'genius', 'two', 'play', 'other', 'entire', 'movie', 'swear', 'nobody', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'dialogue', 'floating', 'off', 'screen', 'Sure', 'are', 'also', 'sequences', 'sewer', 'audience', 'gasping', 'breath.It', 'may', 'be', 're-make', 'not', 'reason', 'turn', 'nose', 'up', 'fine', 'entry', 'buddy-movie', 'genre']",N/A
734108,A2QZX5RPU8BAGK,B000085EFJ,Greg Hirst,"[2, 4]","Oh, boy. Just what I have been waiting for. ANOTHER buddy comedy with an interracial crime-fighting team.Yawn.I got back from I Spy about ten minutes ago, and I realized that I must right my review now before the (few) significant aspects slip through my memory and into the pit where movies like RUSH HOUR and BAD COMPANY go.Owen Wilson and Eddie Murphy star as the klutzy boyish spy Alex Scott (could you come up with a more contrived Boy Scout name?) and black loudmouth boxer... uh... I forget his name. Kelly Robinson. It's sad that I forget, since the screenplay has Robinson repeat his own name over and over and over again. How is it, then, that I managed to forget it? Trust me, it isn't a memory problem.Anyway, Scott is the pushover of the spy world, always screwing up, both with spy stuff and in his social life. He is teamed up with obnoxious boxing champion to, you know, save the world. This time their mission is to uncover the location of a top secret stealth plane that can become invisible both to radar and to the naked eye. It has fallen into the hands of an evil Hungarian terrorist who is about to sell it to an evil Japanese terrorist, who will commit evil terrorists act with it.Scott and Robinson travel to Budapest to track the terrorists and take sdjjjjjjjjjjjjsd... *snort* Huh? Oh sorry. I fell asleep trying to describe the plot of I SPYThere are plenty of action scenes. And there are plenty of jokes. The problem is that the action scenes are routine and uninspired and the jokes aren't funny. No. Eddy Murphy isn't funny here, and neither is Owen Wilson. Oh wait. There is one genuinely funny scene where Scott uses Robinson's street-talk to pick up a sexy collegue (Famke Janssen, who was better in DEEP RISING).I could definitely forgive the film's tired, unimpressive action sequences if only the jokes were good, and vice versa. It simply doesn't happen. Owen Wilson has come a long way since he was swallowed by a giant snake in ANACONDA (yielding a post mortem appearance rivalled only by Jon Voight's) and has since almost become a Hollywood star. I don't blame either Wilson or Murphy for doing this project, because it certainly had potential. But their talents are wasted by the screenplay and ACTION-FLICK-101 direction. Wilson's normally-loveable bumbling charm is exploited to the point of irritation. Murphy is just plain obnoxious. The scenes in which they bicker incessantly are supposed to be funny, but they are so overblown that you can't even hear what either is saying. Which is just as well: I doubt the dialogue they are supposed to be relating is any more entertaining than the sound of their babble.I don't even feel obligated to mention that this is based on a 1960's TV show of the same title, because this movie has nothing to do with the series. It was a waste of money obtaining the rights to use the show's title and premise; besides the title, no one would have noticed the inspiration.There was no reason to make this movie, and if you have seen RUSH HOUR, BAD COMPANY, SHANGHAI NOON, or any other such movie, there is really no reason to see it. Just recently we had movies like The Tuxedo, and there will soon be NATIONAL SECURITY and SHANGHAI KNIGHTS.For a genre that was dead in the first place, it sure it taking a long time to die out.",2,Another tepid entry in the most annoying genre in film today,1056153600,"06 21, 2003",2003,3309,"['Oh', 'boy', 'Just', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'ANOTHER', 'buddy', 'comedy', 'interracial', 'crime-fighting', 'team.Yawn.I', 'got', 'back', 'Spy', 'ten', 'minutes', 'ago', 'realized', 'must', 'right', 'review', 'now', 'few', 'significant', 'aspects', 'slip', 'memory', 'pit', 'where', 'movies', 'RUSH', 'HOUR', 'BAD', 'COMPANY', 'Wilson', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'star', 'klutzy', 'boyish', 'spy', 'Alex', 'Scott', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'more', 'contrived', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'name', 'black', 'loudmouth', 'boxer', 'uh', 'forget', 'name', 'Kelly', 'Robinson', 'sad', 'forget', 'screenplay', 'Robinson', 'repeat', 'own', 'name', 'over', 'again', 'How', 'then', 'managed', 'forget', 'Trust', ""n't"", 'memory', 'problem.Anyway', 'Scott', 'pushover', 'spy', 'world', 'always', 'screwing', 'up', 'spy', 'stuff', 'social', 'life', 'teamed', 'up', 'obnoxious', 'boxing', 'champion', 'know', 'save', 'world', 'time', 'mission', 'uncover', 'location', 'top', 'secret', 'stealth', 'plane', 'can', 'become', 'invisible', 'radar', 'naked', 'eye', 'fallen', 'hands', 'evil', 'Hungarian', 'terrorist', 'who', 'sell', 'evil', 'Japanese', 'terrorist', 'who', 'will', 'commit', 'evil', 'terrorists', 'act', 'it.Scott', 'Robinson', 'travel', 'Budapest', 'track', 'terrorists', 'take', 'sdjjjjjjjjjjjjsd', 'Huh', 'Oh', 'sorry', 'fell', 'asleep', 'trying', 'describe', 'plot', 'are', 'plenty', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'plenty', 'jokes', 'problem', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'routine', 'uninspired', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Eddy', 'Murphy', ""n't"", 'funny', 'here', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Oh', 'wait', 'one', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'Scott', 'Robinson', 'street-talk', 'pick', 'up', 'sexy', 'collegue', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'who', 'was', 'better', 'DEEP', 'RISING', '.I', 'could', 'definitely', 'forgive', 'film', 'tired', 'unimpressive', 'action', 'sequences', 'only', 'jokes', 'were', 'good', 'vice', 'versa', 'simply', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'was', 'swallowed', 'giant', 'snake', 'ANACONDA', 'yielding', 'post', 'mortem', 'appearance', 'rivalled', 'only', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'almost', 'become', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Wilson', 'Murphy', 'doing', 'project', 'certainly', 'had', 'potential', 'talents', 'are', 'wasted', 'screenplay', 'ACTION-FLICK-101', 'direction', 'Wilson', 'normally-loveable', 'bumbling', 'charm', 'exploited', 'point', 'irritation', 'Murphy', 'just', 'plain', 'obnoxious', 'scenes', 'bicker', 'incessantly', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'are', 'so', 'overblown', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'hear', 'what', 'saying', 'Which', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'doubt', 'dialogue', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'relating', 'more', 'entertaining', 'sound', 'babble.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'obligated', 'mention', 'based', '1960', 'TV', 'show', 'same', 'title', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'series', 'was', 'waste', 'money', 'obtaining', 'rights', 'use', 'show', 'title', 'premise', 'title', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'noticed', 'inspiration.There', 'was', 'reason', 'make', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'RUSH', 'HOUR', 'BAD', 'COMPANY', 'SHANGHAI', 'NOON', 'other', 'such', 'movie', 'really', 'reason', 'see', 'Just', 'recently', 'had', 'movies', 'Tuxedo', 'there', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'NATIONAL', 'SECURITY', 'SHANGHAI', 'KNIGHTS.For', 'genre', 'was', 'dead', 'first', 'place', 'sure', 'taking', 'long', 'time', 'die', 'out']",N/A

You recognize that the action sequences are unconvincing and poorly paced. You sense that not one original idea ever entered the minds of director Betty Thomas, her four screenwriters or the head honchos at Sony Pictures during the conception and production of this entire enterprise. And yet you laugh, because there is something goofily entertaining about two of America's best comedic actors stumbling and bumbling through a good old fashion spy spoof. The fact that the stars have such wonderful chemistry legitimizes your positive reaction. A little.The leading players are, of course, Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson, who provide the film with a sense of energy and fun that it probably doesn't deserve. Murphy, who appears as obnoxious boxer turned secret agent Kelly Robinson, has lost none of his impeccable timing and inimitable style to age or a recent string of unsuccessful films. Given only assorted rants and dictionary full of curse words to work with, the man uses his vocal mannerisms and body language to wring laugh after laugh out of stale dialogue (and turns in one of the best renditions of ""Sexual Healing"" you're likely to hear). Wilson is equally engaging as bumbling special agent Alexander Scott, winning pathos and belly laughs as he attempts to win the girl and properly activate his spy gizmos. As these two pros traipse through Hungry, attempting to foil the diabolical scheme of the insidious and thoroughly wasted Malcolm McDowal, one can almost forget that they are watching something formulaic and get lost in the effective repartee and humorous battles of one-upmanship among the leads.The television series on which this movie is based broke new ground in the 1960's by presenting an African-American (a young Bill Cosby) as a dignified and dramatic leading man.

734116,AAW58LG72PG7I,B000085EFJ,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[4, 5]","For those who come to the recent film version of the hit 1960s I SPY, there is the inevitable tendency to compare them, with the film coming off as a pale imitation. In the television series, the focus was on the delicate and artful blending of comedy and action with the magic chemistry of the actors. Viewers simply accepted the reality of a pair of government spies, only one of whom was an athlete.  The viewer of the movie has a much harder job since the blending of comedy and action here is badly off center with jokes and ad libs serving as distractors rather than as advancers of the plot.  There is also the tendency to see Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson in the same light as Chris Rock and Jackie Chan who played much the same pair but with far more success.  In I SPY, Eddie Murphy is the too cool inner city athlete who is co-opted to be a spy by Owen Wilson.  In Murphy's case, his interpretation of Kelly Robinson marks him as an overage rapper wannabe whose only focus is on impressing the ladies.  In Wilson's case, he comes off as way too young and geeky to be taken seriously as a head spook.  Their overly frequent head butting is supposed to entertain but too often annoys. Malcom McDowell also disappoints as the bad guy plane dealer.  He seems to have forgotten how good he was in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE or in TIME AFTER TIME. Famke Janssen generates most of the tension and interest as the leggy spy whose motives are suspect.  What emerges from I SPY is the dulling realization that a great deal of misplaced talent was wasted in a film that could not decide where to draw that fine line between action, humor, and brainlessness.",2,I SPY: Suffers in Comparison with the Original,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,1648,"['who', 'come', 'recent', 'film', 'version', 'hit', '1960s', 'SPY', 'inevitable', 'tendency', 'compare', 'film', 'coming', 'off', 'pale', 'imitation', 'television', 'series', 'focus', 'was', 'delicate', 'artful', 'blending', 'comedy', 'action', 'magic', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'Viewers', 'simply', 'accepted', 'reality', 'pair', 'government', 'spies', 'only', 'one', 'whom', 'was', 'athlete', 'viewer', 'movie', 'much', 'harder', 'job', 'blending', 'comedy', 'action', 'here', 'badly', 'off', 'center', 'jokes', 'ad', 'libs', 'serving', 'distractors', 'rather', 'advancers', 'plot', 'also', 'tendency', 'see', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'same', 'light', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'who', 'played', 'much', 'same', 'pair', 'far', 'more', 'success', 'SPY', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'too', 'cool', 'inner', 'city', 'athlete', 'who', 'co-opted', 'be', 'spy', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Murphy', 'case', 'interpretation', 'Kelly', 'Robinson', 'overage', 'rapper', 'wannabe', 'only', 'focus', 'impressing', 'ladies', 'Wilson', 'case', 'off', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'geeky', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'head', 'spook', 'overly', 'frequent', 'head', 'butting', 'supposed', 'entertain', 'too', 'often', 'Malcom', 'McDowell', 'also', 'bad', 'guy', 'plane', 'dealer', 'have', 'forgotten', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'TIME', 'AFTER', 'TIME', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'most', 'tension', 'interest', 'leggy', 'spy', 'motives', 'are', 'suspect', 'What', 'SPY', 'dulling', 'realization', 'great', 'deal', 'misplaced', 'talent', 'was', 'wasted', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'decide', 'where', 'draw', 'fine', 'line', 'action', 'humor', 'brainlessness']",N/A

I figure that I was and many of the other reviewers that gave I Spy only tepid ratings were not. How else could they give this movie only three stars.I Spy was the funniest movie I've seen since Road Trip in 2000,(which also had tepid reviews) and one of the five most hilarious movies I've ever had the pleasure to view in my Forty-seventeen years.PlotIt seems the latest Air Force fighter, a plane that has a cloaking device, has been stolen by the test pilot and sold to an International Arms dealer, Arnold Gundars,(Malcolm McDowell) who in turn, will most likely sell it, to bidding terrorist organizations for mega bucks. The fictitious Bureau of National Security has assigned the case to second tier, super-agent Alex Scott,(Owen Wilson) who heads a team sent to Budapest, Hungary to find the missing planeObnoxious, loudmouth but undefeated middleweight boxing champion, Kelly Robinson,(Eddie Murphy) who happens to have a title defense scheduled in Budapest is also recruited for the mission not as a spy but to provide cover for Scott. Unfortunately Robinson, who at first doesn't get along with Scott and whose ego knows no limits, doesn't get his role and decides he's also a secret agent and then the fun begins.Just to make things more interesting there are a couple sub-plots with the first string super agent, Carlos,(Gary Cole) who gets all the top of the line gadgets and miniature gizmos while Alex gets stuck with cumbersome hand me downs and Alex's not so secret crush on associate agent, Rachael,(Famke Janssen) which was the basis for one of the funniest scenes in the movie.ActorsKelly Robinson, Eddie MurphyAlex Scott, Owen WilsonArnold Gundars, Malcolm McDowellRachael, Famke JanssenCarlos, Gary ColeDirectorBetty ThomasConclusionWhenever I read a negative review of what I consider a good Movie / Book, I wonder what the motivations were.

It was funny as hell), a buddy movie like ........(so what?), a weak script(yeah, but it wasn't really an action movie!), Black, Eddie Murphy played Stepin Fetchit to White, Owen Wilson(coulda fooled me, I thought Wilson was Murphy's straight man) and Murphy was flat and continued his stretch of losers(I'd like to know what movie they saw, cause I was rolling in the aisle).In summation, I thought the actors did an excellent job, the directing was good, the stunts were very good and the humor was excellent!

Does I Spy deliver on that? Yes, but obviously nothing more than that. I Spy is just another Murphy vehicle like SHOWTIME.

Zwick,"[2, 4]","*1/2 Eddie Murphy fails to revive his sagging career fortunes with ""I-Spy,"" a dreary, inept and uninspired attempt to bring the popular 1960's TV series to the big screen.  Murphy and Owen Wilson take on the roles initially filled by Bill Cosby and Robert Culp, and, while both actors are game players, they have been ill-served by a script - concocted by no fewer than four writers, if you can believe it - that is tired, unimaginative and just plain lousy (to put it mildly).  Watching this film is quite a depressing experience, actually.Not doing much to test his limits here, Murphy plays his typically sassy, wiseass persona, this time as a less-than-convincing world famous boxer who, for some utterly inexplicable reason, is recruited by the U.S. government to partner up with Owens, a second rate secret agent who, like Rodney Dangerfield, feels that he don't get no respect from his fellow spies.  The two unlikely partners are sent on a mission to Budapest to track down a bad guy who has commandeered some kind of stealth fighter jet for his own nefarious purposes (at least I think that was what the plot was about, though, frankly, I don't think I was paying enough attention to really tell).We're supposed to find the banter between these two mismatched, bickering secret agents to be witty and entertaining, but most of their lines end up falling flat.  The stunts - which basically involve the use of all sorts of high-tech gadgetry and the endless dangling of our intrepid heroes from precarious heights - feel like leftovers from every unsuccessful spy spoof ever made.The unutterable failure of ""I-Spy"" is a surprise in a way, since director Betty Thomas has had some previous success at converting old TV series into clever, memorable movies, the prime example being, of course, ""The Brady Bunch Movie.""  But for that film, Thomas really thought about the potential of the material and designed a vehicle that turned a completely ""unhip"" enterprise into something far more endearing, contemporary and relevant than any halfway sensible person could have had any reasonable right to expect.  With ""I-Spy,"" on the other hand, she has simply gone through the motions of making a cookie-cutter spy parody that is utterly devoid of wit, imagination and fun.

The only problem is, he makes lots of mistakes and isn't exactly what you would call James Bond material.  His current mission is to recover a high-tech jet that can camouflage itself so that it appears invisible.  The only problem is, Alex has no idea where the plane is.  Well, he knows that it is in Europe and that Arnold Gundars (Malcolm McDowell) is getting ready to sell it to the highest bidder.  In order to get into Gundars' home and find the jet, Alex has to go undercover - as a flunky of the famous boxer Kelly Robinson (Eddie Murphy).Kelly Robinson has only agreed to let Alex tag along because the president himself called and personally asked him for this favor.  He certainly doesn't want a white boy with no skills hanging around, but Kelly is willing to give it a go if Alex doesn't get in the way.  Unfortunately, Alex has a skill for getting in Kelly's way and, before he knows it, Kelly Robinson is off on a wild ride of madcap escapes, zany stunts, high-tech gadgets, unrequited love, and intrigue while he and Alex hunt to find the jet before is it turned into a weapon against the United States.  But who can they trust....?I thought that this was a pretty funny movie, but there is nothing particularly memorable or fabulous about it.  Owen Wilson is pretty hilarious at times, though, especially when he is using his &quot;top secret&quot; gadgets that don't even begin to compare with Carlos' (Gary Cole), the top special agent in the country.  Eddie Murphy had his funny moments, too, but I find that his humor is more crass and just obvious.  The story was pretty predictable, but the movie had some cool stunts and was fast paced.

734129,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000085EFJ,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Frankly I was hugely disappointed with this one.  Yes, Owen Wilson &amp; Eddie Murphey would have looked a nice pair for a spy film with lots of comedy, and I expected to see some thrills and much laugh from them.  What I saw is, however, just tedious, recycled materials from the genre, and those stars, usually reliable, look very tired.The worst part is the story, which is too far-fetched.  Wilson is a spy Alex (with a cellphone) whose career as secret agent is not clearly auspicious, after an unsuccessful mission.  So, when he is given a task to get back an invisible airplane &quot;Switchblade&quot; stolen from the US government, he is eager to do that job until he finds that he has to accompany an invincible boxing champ Kelly (Eddie Murphey), to go undercover to Budapest, Hungary.  There, he sneaks into a part given by a certain man named Gundars (McDowell, typecast), who must know the whereabout of the airplane.The script, which went through the hands of four credited writers, doesn't show enough comedy nor convincing setting for the two leads to join forces.  The reason those guys should be together is not explained with a satisfactory background, and the best they can do is Kelly's instruction for Alex to woo a female spy Famke Janssen.  Actually, those guys do NOT share the screen long enough, or if they do, they do it in a very forced situation (like hiding in the sewer of Budapest) and the climax of the film is just as confusing as you imagine because of the badly edited action sequences.More incredible thing is that Eddie Murphey's character Kelly is just an annoying guy whose flair for fast and energetic talk is completely gone.  This is the second time I found him so irritating (the first one being &quot;Showtime&quot;) and there is few gadgets or stunts that would make up for the loss of energy that should have been generated from the leads.  The format of the whole film is simply a half-hearted spy parody of 007, and no dynamic actions or tongue-in-cheek comedy can be found here.  Just an automatic flight of 90 minutes, without ups and downs.The best prize, if you insist, should go to the location of the beautiful city of Budapest, and poorly used Famke Janssen, whose devilish &quot;Onatop&quot; character I sincerely miss.",2,Insipid and Weak Remake of the 60s TV Spy Series,1051920000,"05 3, 2003",2003,2277,"['Frankly', 'was', 'hugely', 'disappointed', 'one', 'Yes', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'amp', 'Eddie', 'Murphey', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'nice', 'pair', 'spy', 'film', 'lots', 'comedy', 'expected', 'see', 'thrills', 'much', 'laugh', 'What', 'saw', 'however', 'just', 'tedious', 'recycled', 'materials', 'genre', 'stars', 'usually', 'reliable', 'look', 'very', 'tired.The', 'worst', 'part', 'story', 'too', 'far-fetched', 'Wilson', 'spy', 'Alex', 'cellphone', 'career', 'secret', 'agent', 'not', 'clearly', 'auspicious', 'unsuccessful', 'mission', 'So', 'when', 'given', 'task', 'get', 'back', 'invisible', 'airplane', 'quot', 'Switchblade', 'quot', 'stolen', 'US', 'government', 'eager', 'do', 'job', 'accompany', 'invincible', 'boxing', 'champ', 'Kelly', 'Eddie', 'Murphey', 'go', 'undercover', 'Budapest', 'Hungary', 'part', 'given', 'certain', 'man', 'named', 'Gundars', 'McDowell', 'typecast', 'who', 'must', 'know', 'whereabout', 'airplane.The', 'script', 'went', 'hands', 'four', 'credited', 'writers', ""n't"", 'show', 'enough', 'comedy', 'convincing', 'setting', 'two', 'leads', 'join', 'forces', 'reason', 'guys', 'should', 'be', 'together', 'not', 'explained', 'satisfactory', 'background', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'Kelly', 'instruction', 'Alex', 'woo', 'female', 'spy', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Actually', 'guys', 'do', 'NOT', 'share', 'screen', 'long', 'enough', 'do', 'do', 'very', 'forced', 'situation', 'hiding', 'sewer', 'Budapest', 'climax', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'confusing', 'imagine', 'badly', 'edited', 'action', 'sequences.More', 'incredible', 'thing', 'Eddie', 'Murphey', 'character', 'Kelly', 'just', 'annoying', 'guy', 'flair', 'fast', 'energetic', 'talk', 'completely', 'gone', 'second', 'time', 'found', 'so', 'irritating', 'first', 'one', 'being', 'quot', 'Showtime', 'quot', 'few', 'gadgets', 'stunts', 'would', 'make', 'up', 'loss', 'energy', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'generated', 'leads', 'format', 'whole', 'film', 'simply', 'half-hearted', 'spy', 'parody', '007', 'dynamic', 'actions', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Just', 'automatic', 'flight', '90', 'minutes', 'ups', 'downs.The', 'best', 'prize', 'insist', 'should', 'go', 'location', 'beautiful', 'city', 'Budapest', 'poorly', 'used', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'devilish', 'quot', 'Onatop', 'quot', 'character', 'sincerely', 'miss']",N/A
