Chad Everett was always one of my favorite actors and the show portrayed medical care the way it should be. Doctors should know their patients and be kind and supportive as they were in this show. I look forward to the rest of the episodes becoming available.,5,Mecical Center 2nd season,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,370,"['dvd', 'arrived', 'promptly', 'excellent', 'condition', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', 'first', 'run', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'show', 'portrayed', 'medical', 'care', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'Doctors', 'should', 'know', 'patients', 'be', 'kind', 'supportive', 'were', 'show', 'look', 'forward', 'rest', 'episodes', 'becoming', 'available']",Medical Center: The Complete Second Season

Krawitz,"[0, 2]","Some of the story lines are ridiculous as all the ""drama"" and ""theatrics"", but it brings me back so many memories of that time period of the early 70s.  I think the theme song they used in the 2nd season didn't match the show.  The FIRST season I thought was better and I even liked the theme song for it better in the FIRST season.  I remember the theme song in the 2nd season very well, but always thought it should have gone into a sports show, like a story about track and field, LOL!  It's a nice show with a lot of caring involved in the stories, but there's so much idealism as there was back in the 60s and 70s, even the 80s.  This doesn't happen in the real world.",3,The First season I thought was better than the 2nd season.,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,673,"['story', 'lines', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'drama', 'theatrics', 'back', 'so', 'many', 'memories', 'time', 'period', 'early', '70s', 'think', 'theme', 'song', 'used', '2nd', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'show', 'FIRST', 'season', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'even', 'liked', 'theme', 'song', 'better', 'FIRST', 'season', 'remember', 'theme', 'song', '2nd', 'season', 'very', 'well', 'always', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'sports', 'show', 'story', 'track', 'field', 'LOL', 'nice', 'show', 'lot', 'caring', 'involved', 'stories', 'so', 'much', 'idealism', 'was', 'back', '60s', '70s', 'even', '80s', ""n't"", 'happen', 'real', 'world']",Medical Center: The Complete Second Season
1595354,A3ADLA0JPIICCO,B009DH36ZC,M.Lois,"[6, 6]","Well it has finally arrived! The Complete Second Season of Medical Center. I am in love with Chad Everett all over again! Like the first season, the DVD's are of great quality in both sound and picture. When I originally saw the TV series of Medical Center, I was young,(ahh,so young) and looking back on it now, it is a wonder I was allowed to watch it at all. The panning in on Dr Joe Gannon's (Chad Everett) physique is disarming to say the least. Not good for this lady at 35 and some months of age!!! Also, like the first season, the themes presented are pressing issues of the time, and come to life with the very good acting and engaging guest stars. I am still a tad overawed by the attention to the medical and nursing details in the show, and I believe there are no medical shows today that even come near to ""Medical Center"" in this aspect. Thoroughly enjoyable... and I cannot wait for the third season and hopefully every other season after that, to be released by Warner's !
