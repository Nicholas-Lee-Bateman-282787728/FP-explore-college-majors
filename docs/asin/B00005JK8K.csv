This is followed by combat in the Solomons. The Navajo soldiers will be used as ""code-talkers"", using a language that can't be understood by the enemy forces. The wounded corporal is able to cleverly pass the hearing test and return to active duty. He will protect the code at all costs, and is promoted to sergeant. We see the training camp, the troops are told of their invasion target.The combat scenes are extensive. Using code-talkers saves precious minutes in relaying information. There is an example of prejudice against a Navajo. After the end of battle there is a lull in action. A sudden counter-attack by the enemy surprises the troops. [No sentries on duty?] These violent scenes are dramatic. The troops advance to the last enemy area, up on the ridge. The enemy makes another counter-attack; they also have a number of guns that surprise the advancing marines. [Where is the air reconnaissance and support?] It appears the code talker is close to being captured, but air support arrives to halt the counter-attack.

584079,A3TLY1A7NGVCQM,B00005JK8K,"Alexander E. Paulsen ""AlexP""","[4, 6]","Typical John Woo film. Minimum story; maximum blood.As in Face Off, Woo sets up personal conflicts, moral abiguities, conflicts of duty, friendship, loyalty and emotion. Then develops none of them.This could have been a masterpiece on par with Private Ryan or Thin Red Line, but ended up being a WWII version of 3000 Miles to Graceland.Yes war is about senseless violence and death, but this movie was billed as being a story about the Navaho Code Talkers.I was hoping for a film that was actually about the Navaho Code-talkers. Unfortunately this was not it. Yes it did feature a code-talker or two here and there but it was more about explosions, blood and flying bodies. Not as some reviewers claim war violence but the worst of Hollywood's stylized over choreographed nonsense.Woo kept forgetting that the mnovie was supposedly about the Code talkers, then would suddenly remember and throw in a few seconds of a Navaho yelling into a radio, then back to the gore and explosions.The explosions were not even realistic. I am sorry, but hand grenades do not produce 10 foot fireballs, Thompsons do not fire at 1800 rounds per minutes and .30 carbines do not throw their victims back through the air when the round hits.As in ""Face Off"", John Woo took an intriguing psychological concept, dropped the concept in midstream filled the rest in with unrealistic and excessive violence.I found this movie very tiresome and had I seen it in the theatre I would have most likely have walked out midway through the picture. With the DVD it took me 4 sittings to finally bull my way through it.If you want a proper war movie get or see ""We Were Soldiers""Don't waste your money on this mess of a nonsensical movie.",1,Disappointing,1036108800,"11 1, 2002",2002,1705,"['Typical', 'John', 'Woo', 'film', 'Minimum', 'story', 'maximum', 'blood.As', 'Face', 'Off', 'Woo', 'up', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'moral', 'abiguities', 'conflicts', 'duty', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'emotion', 'Then', 'none', 'them.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'masterpiece', 'par', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'WWII', 'version', '3000', 'Miles', 'Graceland.Yes', 'war', 'senseless', 'violence', 'death', 'movie', 'was', 'billed', 'being', 'story', 'Navaho', 'Code', 'Talkers.I', 'was', 'hoping', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'Navaho', 'Code-talkers', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'Yes', 'did', 'feature', 'code-talker', 'two', 'here', 'there', 'was', 'more', 'explosions', 'blood', 'flying', 'bodies', 'Not', 'reviewers', 'claim', 'war', 'violence', 'worst', 'Hollywood', 'stylized', 'choreographed', 'nonsense.Woo', 'kept', 'forgetting', 'mnovie', 'was', 'supposedly', 'Code', 'talkers', 'then', 'would', 'suddenly', 'remember', 'throw', 'few', 'seconds', 'Navaho', 'yelling', 'radio', 'then', 'back', 'gore', 'explosions.The', 'explosions', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'realistic', 'am', 'sorry', 'hand', 'grenades', 'do', 'not', 'produce', '10', 'foot', 'fireballs', 'Thompsons', 'do', 'not', 'fire', '1800', 'rounds', 'minutes', '.30', 'carbines', 'do', 'not', 'throw', 'victims', 'back', 'air', 'when', 'round', 'hits.As', 'Face', 'Off', 'John', 'Woo', 'took', 'intriguing', 'psychological', 'concept', 'dropped', 'concept', 'midstream', 'filled', 'rest', 'unrealistic', 'excessive', 'violence.I', 'found', 'movie', 'very', 'tiresome', 'had', 'seen', 'theatre', 'would', 'have', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'walked', 'out', 'midway', 'picture', 'DVD', 'took', '4', 'sittings', 'finally', 'bull', 'way', 'it.If', 'want', 'proper', 'war', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'mess', 'nonsensical', 'movie']",N/A
584080,A10WCSGF78M2KE,B00005JK8K,Alfonso A.,"[8, 10]","John Woo goes to war in ""Windtalkers,"" a movie based on a fascinating footnote to World War II. During the combat in the Pacific, the Marines used Navaho ""code talkers,"" who confounded the Japanese by relaying information in their native language, a complex spoken tongue with which few outsiders were familiar. The device proved so successful that the military kept it a secret until the late 1960s, in case they ever needed to use it again.In the movie, Nicolas Cage plays Joe Enders, a Marine sergeant shattered by the loss of his entire squad in combat. Assigned to ""baby-sit"" (his words) Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), a newly recruited Navaho code talker, he's told to protect the code at any cost. Translation: Should Ben fall into enemy hands, Joe is to kill him.Unlike another Marine bodyguard, played by Christian Slater, who befriends his charge (Roger Willie), Joe chooses to distance himself from Ben. That way it will be easier to follow orders. Yet it was following orders that caused the massacre of his men. Showing his medal to Ben, Joe says ruefully, ""I got this for not dying. The 15 men with me got it for dying.""Woo is clearly interested in this story. Joe's inner conflicts are compelling; so is the changeable nature of his relationship with Ben. One minute, he's trying to avoid sitting with him during a lunch break; the next, he's pulling Ben out of enemy fire.Yet Woo, a legendary director of hyperbolic action films (more than a dozen in Hong Kong; ""Face/Off"" and ""Mission: Impossible 2"" in the United States), brings his unique wizardry to the war scenes.""Windtalkers"" may be wrapped around the code talker phenomenon, but at heart it's every bit as much of a World War II flick as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The Sands of Iwo Jima."" Woo's method of capturing the mayhem and chaos of combat is different from Steven Spielberg's, yet both are masters of kinetic filmmaking. It's as if they were born with an extra visual/editing gene.In showing us the battle of Saipan, Woo uses everything from sweeping panoramas to vertiginous crane shots to blood 'n' guts close-ups (including a startlingly original point-of-view shot).These jacked-up battle scenes have an interesting side effect: They help us through the non-action scenes. Much of ""Windtalkers"" is like a '50s war picture, a reflection of Woo's admitted infatuation with the Hollywood movies of his youth. His characters are out of Pauline Kael's so-called bomber-crew cast list: the city guy, the country guy, the starry-eyed rookie, the cynical veteran, etc. What Woo does so magnificently is to wed the brusquely brilliant B-movie clich&eacute;s of a Sam Fuller flick with the pyrotechnic expertise of Hollywood, circa 2002.""Windtalkers"" will rightly bring attention to Beach and Willie; both have a distinct, camera-friendly appeal. But the movie's real beneficiary is Cage, who's found a way to bring parts of his Oscar-winning ""Leaving Las Vegas"" persona to a completely different kind of role. He's the alienated cynic who's also very good at what soldiers are supposed to be good at: killing people.Joe doesn't believe in anything anymore, yet he aches to believe in something - the idea of dying with honor, perhaps, or finding a role that rings true within the concept of wartime heroism. At times, Cage has the clear-eyed, ironic battle fatigue of William Holden, another actor often cast in roles that revealed the disappointed idealist behind the world-weary cynic.""Windtalkers"" will probably disappoint anyone looking for an in-depth look at the code talkers; and it could turn off those unwilling to work with its retro dialogue and characters. Still, it's difficult to resist Woo's explosive artistry and Cage's reluctant hero. For anyone in the mood for an unusual kind of war movie, ""Windtalkers"" is talking your language.",4,Cage + Woo = Explosive Combo,1023840000,"06 12, 2002",2002,3818,"['John', 'Woo', 'war', 'Windtalkers', 'movie', 'based', 'fascinating', 'footnote', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'combat', 'Pacific', 'Marines', 'used', 'Navaho', 'code', 'talkers', 'who', 'confounded', 'Japanese', 'relaying', 'information', 'native', 'language', 'complex', 'spoken', 'tongue', 'few', 'outsiders', 'were', 'familiar', 'device', 'proved', 'so', 'successful', 'military', 'kept', 'secret', 'late', '1960s', 'case', 'ever', 'needed', 'use', 'again.In', 'movie', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Joe', 'Enders', 'Marine', 'sergeant', 'shattered', 'loss', 'entire', 'squad', 'combat', 'Assigned', 'baby-sit', 'words', 'Ben', 'Yahzee', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'newly', 'recruited', 'Navaho', 'code', 'talker', 'told', 'protect', 'code', 'cost', 'Translation', 'Should', 'Ben', 'fall', 'enemy', 'hands', 'Joe', 'kill', 'him.Unlike', 'Marine', 'bodyguard', 'played', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'who', 'charge', 'Roger', 'Willie', 'Joe', 'distance', 'Ben', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'easier', 'follow', 'orders', 'was', 'following', 'orders', 'caused', 'massacre', 'men', 'Showing', 'medal', 'Ben', 'Joe', 'ruefully', 'got', 'not', 'dying', '15', 'men', 'got', 'dying', 'Woo', 'clearly', 'interested', 'story', 'Joe', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'are', 'compelling', 'changeable', 'nature', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'One', 'minute', 'trying', 'avoid', 'sitting', 'lunch', 'break', 'next', 'pulling', 'Ben', 'enemy', 'fire.Yet', 'Woo', 'legendary', 'director', 'hyperbolic', 'action', 'films', 'more', 'dozen', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Face/Off', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'United', 'States', 'unique', 'wizardry', 'war', 'scenes', 'Windtalkers', 'may', 'be', 'wrapped', 'code', 'talker', 'phenomenon', 'heart', 'bit', 'much', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'flick', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Sands', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Woo', 'method', 'capturing', 'mayhem', 'chaos', 'combat', 'different', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'are', 'masters', 'kinetic', 'filmmaking', 'were', 'born', 'extra', 'visual/editing', 'gene.In', 'showing', 'battle', 'Saipan', 'Woo', 'everything', 'sweeping', 'panoramas', 'vertiginous', 'crane', 'shots', 'blood', 'n', 'guts', 'close-ups', 'including', 'startlingly', 'original', 'point-of-view', 'shot', '.These', 'jacked-up', 'battle', 'scenes', 'have', 'interesting', 'side', 'effect', 'help', 'non-action', 'scenes', 'Much', 'Windtalkers', ""'50s"", 'war', 'picture', 'reflection', 'Woo', 'admitted', 'infatuation', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'youth', 'characters', 'are', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'so-called', 'bomber-crew', 'cast', 'list', 'city', 'guy', 'country', 'guy', 'starry-eyed', 'rookie', 'cynical', 'veteran', 'etc', 'What', 'Woo', 'so', 'magnificently', 'wed', 'brusquely', 'brilliant', 'B-movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'Sam', 'Fuller', 'flick', 'pyrotechnic', 'expertise', 'Hollywood', 'circa', '2002', 'Windtalkers', 'will', 'rightly', 'bring', 'attention', 'Beach', 'Willie', 'have', 'distinct', 'camera-friendly', 'appeal', 'movie', 'real', 'beneficiary', 'Cage', 'who', 'found', 'way', 'bring', 'parts', 'Oscar-winning', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'persona', 'completely', 'different', 'kind', 'role', 'alienated', 'cynic', 'who', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'soldiers', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'good', 'killing', 'people.Joe', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anything', 'anymore', 'yet', 'believe', 'something', 'idea', 'dying', 'honor', 'perhaps', 'finding', 'role', 'true', 'concept', 'wartime', 'heroism', 'times', 'Cage', 'clear-eyed', 'ironic', 'battle', 'fatigue', 'William', 'Holden', 'actor', 'often', 'cast', 'roles', 'revealed', 'disappointed', 'idealist', 'world-weary', 'cynic', 'Windtalkers', 'will', 'probably', 'disappoint', 'anyone', 'looking', 'in-depth', 'look', 'code', 'talkers', 'could', 'turn', 'off', 'unwilling', 'work', 'retro', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'Still', 'difficult', 'resist', 'Woo', 'explosive', 'artistry', 'Cage', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'anyone', 'mood', 'unusual', 'kind', 'war', 'movie', 'Windtalkers', 'talking', 'language']",N/A

584083,A15S44J4NHU4LS,B00005JK8K,"Alvin Tanhehco ""kerki""","[6, 10]","The year is 1944.  America is out to take over Saipan that remains a Japanese stronghold.  Cage is a decorated soldier that recovers from an ear injury and is promoted to Sergeant by accepting the role as the protector of a Navajo code-talking radio man.  At first he wants to keep his distance knowing what he'll have to do when his codetalker is going to be captured.  But Ben Yazi, his codetalker, proves to be a young, paternal, loyal and highly patriotic comrade.  Little by little the new Navajo codes prove indecipherable to the Japanese and indispensable to the Americans.  So, the Japanese army makes it their new mission to try to capture one of the codetalkers for interrogation.  Therein lies the underlying conflict of the whole film.Cage adopts the same acting style he used in Face Off (also directed by John Woo), a sort of manic-depressive character.  Sometimes, he runs around hog wild shooting and killing the enemy.  Sometimes, he just sits around feeling sorry for himself.  Another reviewer commented on John Woo's signature ballet-of-bullets style, but I just found it gratuitous.  I also found the landscape somewhat fake/staged.  I'm really disappointed with all the other characters in the film.  Cage is THE star and he's always in the limelight.  Slater plays another sergeant with similar duties, but his purpose in the film is only to show that these codetalker-protectors also struggle with their orders.  When it comes to taking the life of a fellow soldier, wouldn't you think twice?I'm personally very tired of watching war movies.  This film is so repetitive at times, that you can tune out entire sequences in the movie and still not miss anything.  So I cannot highly recommend this film unless you're a diehard John Woo fan.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3.5 (nothing special, some humor injected during the quiet times)E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)A (Action) - 4 (we see lots of people getting shot, burned and limbs blown apart)P (Plot) - 2 (really simple plot, does cage do his duty or do what's humane?)",3,Not another war movie...,1024272000,"06 17, 2002",2002,2077,"['year', '1944', 'America', 'out', 'take', 'over', 'Saipan', 'Japanese', 'stronghold', 'Cage', 'decorated', 'soldier', 'ear', 'injury', 'promoted', 'Sergeant', 'accepting', 'role', 'protector', 'Navajo', 'code-talking', 'radio', 'man', 'first', 'keep', 'distance', 'knowing', 'what', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'when', 'codetalker', 'going', 'be', 'captured', 'Ben', 'Yazi', 'codetalker', 'be', 'young', 'paternal', 'loyal', 'highly', 'patriotic', 'comrade', 'Little', 'little', 'new', 'Navajo', 'codes', 'prove', 'indecipherable', 'Japanese', 'indispensable', 'Americans', 'So', 'Japanese', 'army', 'new', 'mission', 'try', 'capture', 'one', 'codetalkers', 'interrogation', 'Therein', 'underlying', 'conflict', 'whole', 'film.Cage', 'same', 'acting', 'style', 'used', 'Face', 'Off', 'also', 'directed', 'John', 'Woo', 'sort', 'manic-depressive', 'character', 'Sometimes', 'hog', 'wild', 'shooting', 'killing', 'enemy', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'around', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'John', 'Woo', 'signature', 'ballet-of-bullets', 'style', 'just', 'found', 'gratuitous', 'also', 'found', 'landscape', 'somewhat', 'fake/staged', ""'m"", 'really', 'disappointed', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'Cage', 'THE', 'star', 'always', 'limelight', 'Slater', 'sergeant', 'similar', 'duties', 'purpose', 'film', 'only', 'show', 'codetalker-protectors', 'also', 'struggle', 'orders', 'When', 'taking', 'life', 'fellow', 'soldier', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'twice', ""'m"", 'personally', 'very', 'tired', 'watching', 'war', 'movies', 'film', 'so', 'repetitive', 'times', 'can', 'tune', 'out', 'entire', 'sequences', 'movie', 'still', 'not', 'miss', 'anything', 'can', 'not', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', ""'re"", 'diehard', 'John', 'Woo', 'fan.LEAP', 'rating', '5', '============================L', 'Language', '3.5', 'nothing', 'special', 'humor', 'injected', 'quiet', 'times', 'E', 'Erotica', '0', 'n/a', 'A', 'Action', '4', 'see', 'lots', 'people', 'getting', 'shot', 'burned', 'limbs', 'blown', 'apart', 'P', 'Plot', '2', 'really', 'simple', 'plot', 'cage', 'do', 'duty', 'do', 'what', 'humane']",N/A

Beginning scenes are reminiscent of the Viet Nam atrocities, but this was an earlier war with those dreaded Japs in 1944.We learn of the enormous contributions our Native Americans' skill helped to deflect the enemy.  We owe so much to the folks who really belong here, those who inhabited this country first.  Indians are not all alcoholics or slow learners.  There are some geniuses as in our Caucasian population.The questionable loss of life in any war is so apparent here.  Because the South conceded victory in 1865, the Southern soldier is portrayed as ignorant with his dialect, though he is proclaiming his pride in representing his country.Some scenes of the fighting look identical to the Frank Sinatra movie, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY.  One shows a beautiful native American in a SOUTH PACIFIC paradise until he is confronted by an ""ignorant"" soldier from the South telling him, The only difference between you and the Japs is that uniform.""The Indian playing his wood flute accompanied by the GI on his harmonica is a moving interlude as we watch the jeeps transporting a battallion through the jungle, straight into an ambush by their own men.

The war scenes are riveting and could not be done better. We see some introspective in five of the characters, Sgt. Enders, Yahzee, Sgt. Anderson, Charlie Whitehorse, and Chick. The rest are poorly developed. We hope to see the story of the Windtalkers but it is never truly developed completely. We see there is a Navaho code developed, and Tank is Turtle in that code. Then we see Cage told he must defend his code talker and the code itself above all. Most of the rest the movie is battle scenes but we periodically see a sprinkling of code talkers telling enemy coordinates to one another for support or shooting the breeze about what is happening in their company. Although very interesting it doesn't touch us emotionally like Private Ryan did. I think with a little more character development, especially the Indians, it would have been a great movie. When Yahzee gets mad at Sgt. Enders and runs around wildly killing Japanese without concern for those trying to protect him, it didn't endear me to him.

Though one would think that is what the primary focus of the film is given that its what the publicity for the film, and its title, have focused on.While Windtalkers does grant considerable attention to the Code Talkers, they are not the primary focus of the film's story.  The primary story is about a small, fictional unit of Marines who fight in the Battle of Saipan in the Pacific during the war.  They are a forward Marine recon unit, with two Code Talkers assigned to the unit.The two primary characters of the film are Ben Yahzee, a Code Talker, and Sergeant Joe Enders (Nicholas Cage), a battle hardened Marine assigned to protect Yahzee and the valuable code he posseses in his head.  If necessary, Enders is to kill Yahzee if he is in severe danger of falling into the hands of the enemy, to ""protect the code"" at all costs.The main character dynamics of the film focus on Ender's battles with personal demons and battle scaring from his previous war experiences, Yahzee's experiences of battle for the first time and with racism on the part of some of his fellow Marines, and the complex relationship that develops between these two men.  In the battles they fight together, they develop an abiding respect and friendship for one another that is severely tested by events.Though the Code Talkers are surprisingly not the main focus of this film's story, it is given exploration in two primary ways.  1) We the viewer get to see how the Code Talkers are trained to use the code, and how important it is due to the fact its the only code the Japanese had not been able to break, and 2) How the code talkers used their knowledge to affect the outcomes of battles, and save the lives of their fellow Marines.  Some claim this is the only time on film that the Code Talkers have been featured.  This is not correct, because they were featured in a 1955 film called ""Battle Cry"" (albeit briefly).  But this is certainly the most attention that the Code Talkers have ever gotten on film, and it is well deserved for their contributions to winning World War II.The one thing I was skeptical about was whether John Woo, an action movie director, could pull off making a serious war picture without slow motion Mission Impossible Two like scenes, or Nick Cage motorcycling around Japanese, or other typical straight up action film parlance.  I was wonderfully pleased, however, with just how well Woo does in composing this film as a serious story about the violence of war.  In fact, he uses some of his action movie directing talents to great effect, with many startling moments in the picture that leave the audience unprepared for what they are about to see in certain scenes.  In one scene (which I will not describe in detail so as not to spoil anyone too much) has a battle starting out of no where with a shocking scene showing just how unpredictable combat can be.All in all, an impressive picture if one takes the film for what it is (a great war picture about the contributions of the U.S. Marines, including the Code Talkers, to the war, and about the relationships of men in combat) and not what they would expect it to be (a film focusing primarily on the Code Talkers).",4,"Not what you would expect, but great none the less.",1024963200,"06 25, 2002",2002,3356,"['go', 'see', 'Windtalkers', 'thinking', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'film', 'focusing', 'primarily', 'Navajo', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'then', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'see', 'film', 'would', 'expect', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'what', 'primary', 'focus', 'film', 'given', 'what', 'publicity', 'film', 'title', 'have', 'focused', 'on.While', 'Windtalkers', 'grant', 'considerable', 'attention', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'are', 'not', 'primary', 'focus', 'film', 'story', 'primary', 'story', 'small', 'fictional', 'unit', 'Marines', 'who', 'fight', 'Battle', 'Saipan', 'Pacific', 'war', 'are', 'forward', 'Marine', 'recon', 'unit', 'two', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'assigned', 'unit.The', 'two', 'primary', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'Ben', 'Yahzee', 'Code', 'Talker', 'Sergeant', 'Joe', 'Enders', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'battle', 'hardened', 'Marine', 'assigned', 'protect', 'Yahzee', 'valuable', 'code', 'head', 'necessary', 'Enders', 'kill', 'Yahzee', 'severe', 'danger', 'falling', 'hands', 'enemy', 'protect', 'code', 'costs.The', 'main', 'character', 'dynamics', 'film', 'focus', 'Ender', 'battles', 'personal', 'demons', 'battle', 'scaring', 'previous', 'war', 'experiences', 'Yahzee', 'experiences', 'battle', 'first', 'time', 'racism', 'part', 'fellow', 'Marines', 'complex', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'battles', 'fight', 'together', 'develop', 'abiding', 'respect', 'friendship', 'one', 'severely', 'tested', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'story', 'given', 'exploration', 'two', 'primary', 'ways', '1', 'viewer', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'are', 'trained', 'use', 'code', 'how', 'important', 'due', 'fact', 'only', 'code', 'Japanese', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'break', '2', 'How', 'code', 'talkers', 'used', 'knowledge', 'affect', 'outcomes', 'battles', 'save', 'lives', 'fellow', 'Marines', 'claim', 'only', 'time', 'film', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'have', 'been', 'featured', 'not', 'correct', 'were', 'featured', '1955', 'film', 'called', 'Battle', 'Cry', 'briefly', 'certainly', 'most', 'attention', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'have', 'ever', 'gotten', 'film', 'well', 'deserved', 'contributions', 'winning', 'World', 'War', 'II.The', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'skeptical', 'was', 'John', 'Woo', 'action', 'movie', 'director', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'making', 'serious', 'war', 'picture', 'slow', 'motion', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Two', 'scenes', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'motorcycling', 'Japanese', 'other', 'typical', 'straight', 'up', 'action', 'film', 'parlance', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'pleased', 'however', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'Woo', 'composing', 'film', 'serious', 'story', 'violence', 'war', 'fact', 'action', 'movie', 'directing', 'talents', 'great', 'effect', 'many', 'startling', 'moments', 'picture', 'leave', 'audience', 'unprepared', 'what', 'are', 'see', 'certain', 'scenes', 'one', 'scene', 'will', 'not', 'describe', 'detail', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'anyone', 'too', 'much', 'battle', 'starting', 'where', 'shocking', 'scene', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'unpredictable', 'combat', 'can', 'be.All', 'impressive', 'picture', 'one', 'film', 'what', 'great', 'war', 'picture', 'contributions', 'U.S.', 'Marines', 'including', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'war', 'relationships', 'men', 'combat', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'film', 'focusing', 'primarily', 'Code', 'Talkers']",N/A

Unlike Black Hawk Down, which I think is the best war movie ever made, this film is more like an old fashioned Rambo type action flick were one man (Cage mostly) can take out many with a single weapon. It doesn't try to be as realistic as the other war films we've seen of late (which is getting a bit redundant), this film instead tries to be an action film! I mean, after all, it is directed by the legendary John Woo (Hard Boiled; Face/Off). I think Woo must have learned what he knew of WWII from old war films which is great because it pays off for a fun time at the movies here! Christian Slater is great in this comeback role (looking forward to the upcoming BOUNTY KILLER, hope it's still in production) as is the main Navajo soldier, Adam Beach. Beach is very likable and I don't think that he should be typecast as an Indian in the future. Let's not worry about his ethnicity and cast him in VAN HELSING instead of Hugh Jackman or in THE GREAT RAID instead of Benjamin Bratt or in anything that Paul Walker or Chris Klein get cast in instead of casting them (Beach in ROLLERBALL would have at least helped a little right?) Why not? It's Nicholas Cage's performance that sometimes falls flat. If John Wayne were alive today we could have placed him into Cage's role and he would have fit like a glove. This IS the type of film that John Wayne made only it's a bit bloodier with better special effects (minus one battleship scene)! Wayne would have eaten this thing up! Don't listen to what many of the critics are saying about this film, after all what do they know? Critics don't know how to have a good time at the movies. I recommend anyone who is a fan of WOO, action films, war movies, Indian's, or Christian Slater to go and check out Windtalkers! I think I might even go and see it again today! It's A GREAT FUN OLD TIME at the movies! What else do you want in a summer ACTION flick?P.S. John Woo, why not cast Christian Slater as the Irish immigrant in THE DIVIDE (MEN OF DESTINY) instead of Nicolas Cage?

The reality is, Cage has orders to kill him if it looks like he might fall into enemy hands. Beach does a great job as Yahzee, often blowing the sometimes over-the-top Cage away. (Despite his crazed theatrics, Cage is also good in the role of Joe Enders, Yahzee's ""Protector"", who often seems like a killing machine.) Woo makes the battle scenes come alive vividly; I haven't ever seen such a visceral portrayal of front-line battle, except for Saving Private Ryan. There are also some really nice moments between Christian Slater and his partner, Whitehorse. The violence is, at times, stomach-churning, but that's certainly justified, considering the subject matter.I fully expect Adam Beach to go on to great things as a result of this movie, and hopefully this will make more people aware of the Native American contribution to the freedom we all enjoy today.

584112,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,B00005JK8K,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[7, 13]","John Woo brilliantly takes full advantage of modern day special effects to show war in all its hideousness. Windtalkers is not for the squeamish because there is plenty of blood and gone throughout the film. The story revolves around the Navaho Army soldiers, nicknamed windtalkers, trained to transmit messages in theirown indigenous tongue. Japanese code cracking experts were dumbfounded and unable to research any printed texts because the Navaho language relied solely upon an oral tradition. This left them frustrated and powerless to predict the subsequent moves of the allied troops. Sergeant Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage) is assigned the task to personally guard Private Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), a highly gifted Navaho code specialist. This top secret code must be protected at all cost and the Japanese are more than willing to torture a captured windtalker to get there hands on it. Sgt. Enders is ordered to kill Ben if this possibility ever arises. Notsurprisingly, this discourages him from getting too friendly with Ben. Joe is also a blue collar individual of Italian descent and the much younger soldier plans on eventually attending college. Their odd couple relationship is awkward to say the least.Racism pervaded the attitudes of many white GIs. The windtalkers were invaluable in keeping them alive, but old ingrained prejudices remained. Sadly, Woo isunable to deftly handle the dramatic scenes dealing with the interactions of flawed and imperfect human beings. The strong supporting cast that includes Christian Slater, Peter Stormare, and Noah Emmerich, cannot completely make up for John Woo's glaring weaknesses in this regard. Still, Windtalkers earns a full five stars. Woo, a master in battlefield cinematic choreography, has sufficiently succeeded in providing a glimpse of hell on earth. Wars might sometimes be unavoidably necessary, but we have a moral duty not to be cavalier in our decision making. There are regretfully instances when American military personnel must be placed in harm's way.

There are moments of war movie ""greatness"" in this picture. The opening scenes in the Solomons with close quarter bayonet fighting are well done. The opening scenes of the invasian of Saipan are also great with an impressive eye for detail in regards to the scope of the battlefield. You can see Corsairs flying low and dropping their payload on Japanese bunkers. The fighting is intense and both armies take heavy losses in an intense confrontation. Towards the end of the movie the Japanese pull out heavy cannons that level Sherman tanbks at will, its great footage. The acting is well done too. But the problems are someimes hard to overlook. Too many times Japanese guys have Cage and his Navejo code talkers surrounded only to be shot to smithereens. In one scene towards the end, Cage uses his pistol to shoot 4 guys in an instant with their guns drawn. Not likely. And you can only see so many scenes where a grenade goes off sending 2 or 3 soldiers flying 10 feet in the air. This movie has a high body count and plenty of carnage, it isn't as concentrated as Saving Private Ryans first 30 minutes, however it easily tops that movie in overall killing.

If you went to the toilet during one of the few dialogue bits, you would have missed out on the profound themes.  These profound themes would have been interrupted by senseless pyrotechnics by the time you got out of the loo.Wherever John Wayne pointed his gun, an Indian falls.  Same here.  Wherever John Woo points his camera, battle hardened Japanese seem to fall like flies.  Sergeant Nicolas Cage shoots up [Japanese] by the dozens, not just any [Japanese], but battle hardened [Japanese] dug in on Saipan.  When Sgt Cage fires into the air the Japanese catch his bullets.  Sgt Cage also manages to get a Japanese sniper atop a coconut tree - with his tommy-gun pointed horizontally.  No he never misses a Japanese.  The only homage to reality is the number of times the Marines run low on ammo, a reality rarely shown in other war movies.Yes, both Sgt Cage and his Windtalker were both educated as Catholics.  The racial stereotyping is not confined to Navajos.  The hyperventilating Greeks get it.  Captain Corelli gets an Italian sized dose.  The Japanese get it.  Only the Chinese who were not in the movie were spared.  There were other themes, like battle fatigue, family, childhood as 8 year olds, unfair distribution of credit for valour and so on.  All truncated by gratuitous action sequences and oversized secondary explosions.The theme which really got to me and kept me going throughout the film is Sgt Cage's agenda.  His orders were to protect the Navajo code at all cost.  Which means that he has to frag his Indian instead of allowing him to fall into enemy hands.  One Navaho got the idea near the end of the movie.  There was something wrong about a cowboy watching an Indian's back, he says.  There is something really eerie about this.  After all that bonding, the white man was supposed to waste the Indian he was baby-sitting.  Nicolas Cage snaps and asks to be re-assigned.  He was refused and had to go along to take that high ridge in Saipan.When surrounded by [Japanese], he is confronted with the problem of wasting his Windtalker.  See the movie yourself.

While the premise of the movie is about the Navajo code talkers, the movie is much more. It is not just about the unbreakable code that the Native American soldiers spoke, aiding the big guns to do their jobs in helping save soldiers lives. The story is one that needed to be told decades ago - but better late than never.The movie is graphic, though not quite on the same scale as ""Saving Private Ryan."" The plots are similar but ""Wind Talkers"" evolves relationships better than  ""Saving Private Ryan"" did. In this particular story, 2 sergeants are responsible for the safety of their assigned code speakers and must protect them at all costs - and kill them if capture is imminent so that the code cannot be broken. I'll not give away the details of the movie but I'll let you know while some of it is predictable, it's not exactly who and what you think.I appreciate that there were no gratuitous love affairs to detract from the movie as was present in ""Pearl Harbor."" While the graphic presentation of the harsh realities of war aren't as intense as others (Saving Private Ryan), the story line and character development blow it out of the water. I don't appreciate some of the hand-to-hand combat as it seemed a bit unrealistic and over the edge, which is too bad because a lot of the bullets flying and bombs exploding were realistic in the film. This stops me from rating a full five stars. However, as I stated earlier, it is not what makes this movie.The story contains racism, religious issues, moral and ethical decision-making, duty and other elements. However, it transcends and develops into much more that help erase racial lines and helps evolve morals and ethics into something higher that involves deep compassion and true honor.All of the characters were cast splendidly. My favorite actor happened to be Adam Beach, who plays the main Navajo character. He's my favorite Native American actor (Smoke Signals and others) and this movie helps establish him even more than before. What surprised me most was that I actually liked Nicholas Cage. I normally do not like his roles in movies and had a sour taste about him. However, he restores himself in my opinion in his role. Beautifully done! John Woo has done an excellent job putting this flick together and is probably among his best works.Do I recommend ""Wind Talkers""? Absolutely! Please don't take young children to the movie!

That would have been much more interesting and important.Instead, we get a movie that should be called ""Messed Up In the Head Windtalker Babysitter"" - a movie full of cliche characters and soliloquies that just does not work. For that matter, neither do most of the action scenes. The first rule of a war movie is to make you love the character and then put him in all sorts of dangerous situations so you can worry if he's going to die. It's simple - the viewer is emotionally invested in the story. It never happened for me in this one, despite the massive amounts of explosions.

Windtalkers: Woo's pathetic attempt to elevate Native Americans from Hollywood's Tonto.  So, why give this movie three stars?  The actors in this movie were superb.Newcomer, Adam Beach (and his gorgeous smile) did a fine job holding his own against co-star Nicholas Cage (whose slight eye and body movements were underscored by a terrible score).  Lovable Mark Ruffalo zips in and out of scenes, provoding a strong character you pray makes it home alive.  There are also numerous cameos and small roles given to the old-timers like Peter Stormare and Jason Isaacs add to the movie's strong cast.While it is obvious that Woo had military consultants, he cheapened it with Hollywood melodrama. There where too many over-the-top war scenes: rolling while simutaneously shooting, arm flailing deaths, and the curses at comrades between gurgling mouthfulls of blood.  The abrupt closeups throughout the movie add wonderful cheese; it was perhaps the best special effect in the whole movie!  The score's cliche cords threatened to overpower the actors and hindered the movie greatly.

Sure it wasn't totally historically accurate. Sure it had some cliches. But let's be honest; not every war movie is historically accurate. A lot of war movies focus more on drama and the soldiers' lives. This one didn't. This was an action epic, and I liked that. While movies like Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart focused on acting, this one focused on action. Both are good. John Woo did a good job, and Nicolas Cage's acting was fine.

584127,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B00005JK8K,Emily Todd,"[17, 25]","John Woo fails miserably with his latest film, ""Windtalkers"".  Where do I begin?  There are just so many problems with this movie...The premise is fantastic; Navajo Indians are recruited during WWII to be code talkers, as the militaries latest code is the Navajo language.  The Japanese kept breaking all the other codes the military instated but can't seem to break the Navajo language.  Since this new code is so valuable to the military; a Marine must protect each Navajo code talker.  This is not necessarily to ensure their safety, but to protect the code.  This means killing the Navajo if they are in danger of being captured.  Nicolas Cage plays Joe Enders, a war-weary Marine who is assigned to protect Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), a new Navajo code talker recruit.The premise is interesting, but the script, sadly, is full of:Cliches - Ben Yahzee saves the life of a Marine who has been bullying him, oh please, how many times has that been done?Corny Lines - too many that deserve to be mentioned.Unneeded Gore - I love war movies and have no problem with gore, but most of the gore here was for ""visual pleasure"" only.Hong-Kong style action - John Woo, this is not ""Mission Impossible"".Unimportant Subplots - Joe Ender's hinted attraction to Frances O' Connor's character went absolutely nowhere and was a waste of time.Incorrect or ""Modified"" History - If you're going to make a movie about a real-life event, at least get your historical facts right.Focuses on the ""wrong thing"" - Focuses on action when it should belong to the Navajo and honor their sacrifices and spirituality.Absurd character motivations & actions - Kind and forgiving Ben Yahzee, who forgave so many of Joe Ender's blunders, turned into a monster when it was obvious that Joe Ender's was right.Annoying self-contradiction from the characters - Joe Enders repeatedly stresses how he must protect Yahzee, but then right after repeating his speech about his protection duty, he willingly sends Yahzee into one of the most dangerous situations possible.Emotional Staleness - ""Windtalkers"" never really connected with audiences, which I hated.  In order for a movie to be effective, especially a war movie which focuses mainly on action, there MUST be an emotional link to the characters.  The ending is supposed to be emotional and tearful, but you find yourself clapping with joy that this overly long, 133 minute mess is finally over.Nicolas Cage logs one of his worst acting jobs to date, but the delightful Adam Beach picks up the slack.  As many other reviewers have pointed out, Cage sports his manic depressed and confused look throughout the film.  It gets to be quite annoying.  The high-point of the film was definitely in the acting.  Not Cage's but the Marine's, who consistently provided comic relief throughout the film.  They also brought the war to life with the friendships and bonds between them.The action, though impressive, is overdone and quickly becomes tiresome.  Something happens that definitely should not; the audience, so numb after an hour or so of shooting, flying bodies, explosions, and gore, begins to tune it all out.I was so disappointed with ""Windtalkers"".

584128,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005JK8K,Eric,"[2, 5]","Windtalkers is the latest (and probably the last) in a long line of seemingly never-ending war films. It all began with Enemy at the Gates and since then, we've had Pearl Harbor, Uprising (yeah, it's TV, but it counts), Black Hawk Down, Hart's War, We Were Soldiers, and now Windtalkers, a John Woo war film that is, unsurprisingly, graphically violent and combat-oriented.The movie itself claims to tell the story of the Windtalkers, Navajo codetalkers who were vital to the U.S. military in the South Pacific during the second world war. Adam Beach plays one such codetalkers and Nicolas Cage is his bodyguard assigned to protect the code ""at all costs."" If you go into the film expecting an in-depth look at these codetalkers, you're going to be pretty disappointed. The actual film plays more like a series of deadly situations that a squad faces, which serve pretty much as excuses for John Woo to show his action prowess.The battle scenes, the film's true selling point, are mostly effective for what they are, though there are a few clunkers. The massive-scale fight for Saipan is impressive and quite a tense, lengthy sequence. It's probably the most epic modern infantry combat scene featured on film since the D-Day opening to Saving Private Ryan. A skirmish in a Japanese village definitely features John Woo's signature kinetic touch, and it's probably the movie's most exciting action sequence. Unfortunately, not all these moments work. The battle on the mountain, for instance, is hard to swallow. At one point in this segment, four U.S. marines manage to kill around fifty Japanese soldiers, as would be my rough estimate. Hell, there's even a scene where Nicolas Cage, lying on the ground, whips out his colt .45, and without properly aiming, fires four shots in quick succession and takes down four enemy soldiers charging down a hill!Aside from all the battle scenes (five in all, if you count the massacre in the opening), there isn't much else worth mentioning. The story is played out in a routine, predictable fashion and some of the characters (whether it's the gung-ho Racist, the scared Greek, or the Guy Who's Afraid His Wife is Cheating on Him) are mostly one-note and stereotypical. I didn't learn much about Navajo Windtalkers, and what codetalking was featured could have just as easily been delivered in plain English without any effect on the battle. To be fair, though, the friendships developed between the codetalkers and their bodyguards is palpable and even slightly touching at times (bolstered by the decent performances from the four leads: Cage, Beach, Willie, and surprisingly enough, Christian Slater, who's almost always awful in everything he's in).You're not going to learn anything new watching Windtalkers, but it's a so-so effort that war film buffs will probably want to catch just for the blistering action. It's a rather plotless, unoriginal, cliched, and occasionally very dull (when it's off the battlefield) affair that would have worked better had there been greater focus in the script.** 1/2 out of *****",3,Just another war film.,1029974400,"08 22, 2002",2002,3063,"['Windtalkers', 'latest', 'probably', 'last', 'long', 'line', 'seemingly', 'never-ending', 'war', 'films', 'began', 'Enemy', 'Gates', 'then', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Uprising', 'yeah', 'TV', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Hart', 'War', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'now', 'Windtalkers', 'John', 'Woo', 'war', 'film', 'unsurprisingly', 'graphically', 'violent', 'combat-oriented.The', 'movie', 'tell', 'story', 'Windtalkers', 'Navajo', 'codetalkers', 'who', 'were', 'vital', 'U.S.', 'military', 'South', 'Pacific', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'one', 'such', 'codetalkers', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'bodyguard', 'assigned', 'protect', 'code', 'costs', 'go', 'film', 'expecting', 'in-depth', 'look', 'codetalkers', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'actual', 'film', 'more', 'series', 'deadly', 'situations', 'squad', 'serve', 'pretty', 'much', 'excuses', 'John', 'Woo', 'show', 'action', 'prowess.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'film', 'true', 'selling', 'point', 'are', 'mostly', 'effective', 'what', 'are', 'are', 'few', 'clunkers', 'massive-scale', 'fight', 'Saipan', 'impressive', 'quite', 'tense', 'lengthy', 'sequence', 'probably', 'most', 'epic', 'modern', 'infantry', 'combat', 'scene', 'featured', 'film', 'D-Day', 'opening', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'skirmish', 'Japanese', 'village', 'definitely', 'John', 'Woo', 'signature', 'kinetic', 'touch', 'probably', 'movie', 'most', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequence', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'moments', 'work', 'battle', 'mountain', 'instance', 'hard', 'swallow', 'one', 'point', 'segment', 'four', 'U.S.', 'marines', 'manage', 'kill', 'around', 'fifty', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'would', 'be', 'rough', 'estimate', 'Hell', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'lying', 'ground', 'out', 'colt', '.45', 'properly', 'aiming', 'four', 'shots', 'quick', 'succession', 'down', 'four', 'enemy', 'soldiers', 'charging', 'down', 'hill', 'Aside', 'battle', 'scenes', 'five', 'count', 'massacre', 'opening', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'story', 'played', 'out', 'routine', 'predictable', 'fashion', 'characters', 'gung-ho', 'Racist', 'scared', 'Greek', 'Guy', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Wife', 'Cheating', 'Him', 'are', 'mostly', 'one-note', 'stereotypical', 'did', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'Navajo', 'Windtalkers', 'what', 'codetalking', 'was', 'featured', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'easily', 'been', 'delivered', 'plain', 'English', 'effect', 'battle', 'be', 'fair', 'though', 'friendships', 'developed', 'codetalkers', 'bodyguards', 'palpable', 'even', 'slightly', 'touching', 'times', 'bolstered', 'decent', 'performances', 'four', 'leads', 'Cage', 'Beach', 'Willie', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'who', 'almost', 'always', 'awful', 'everything', '.You', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'learn', 'anything', 'new', 'watching', 'Windtalkers', 'so-so', 'effort', 'war', 'film', 'buffs', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'catch', 'just', 'blistering', 'action', 'rather', 'plotless', 'unoriginal', 'cliched', 'occasionally', 'very', 'dull', 'when', 'battlefield', 'affair', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'greater', 'focus', 'script', '**', '1/2', '*****']",N/A

The transition was rough and he didn't translate well. ""Windtalkers"" is evidence of that.Here's the scoop. During WWII the U.S. military began using Navajo Indians to speak code so the enemy not only can't break it because of the code. They can't break the language. Nicholas Cage is a sergeant assigned to one of the Navajo Windtalkers to protect him and make certain he doesn't fall into enemy hands and divulge the code. Cage has some serious baggage so the task proves a difficult one.This is a very uneven film. Woo, known for his directing of action scenes, does a poor job in the opening scene. It's stiff and clunky. But then the action shifts to Sai Pan and he really steps up and delivers some of the best battle scenes ever filmed. But then there's the script. I'm guessing Woo, not having a good enough ear for the English language, didn't know when the script contained some really clunky, cliche ridden dialogue and situations. Between the battle scenes there are attempts to flesh out the story and characters that have been done way too times. Also, given the set-up, the viewer knows there are only a couple of ways this can end. It's merely a matter of which way the writers want the coin to fall. The acting is decent enough. Nick Cage is about as good as you're going to see him.The rest of the roles are played decent enough, but no one looks as though they're fishing for an academy award.This is an interesting chapter in history.

We in this current generation are used to theater wars, but this was the Big One, a World War, where the fate of the planet depended on the allies against global domination of evil.Why it is in human nature to wage war is beyond this reviewer. After the sacrifice of so many lives in World War II and the holocaust in Europe and the Japanese POW concentration camps, as recently as 1994 it happened all over again, genocide and murder of innocents including children in Bosnia, and the worst atrocities of all , Srebrenicia.Still this film is a testament to what is good about human nature, in the worst of circumstances, and also to ironies, but above all it is about the Windtalkers, the Navaho and their unique cultural heritage, and ultimatley how important saving that heritage proved to be, in that their language saved the West. From the beginning of the film at the reservation to the end back to the reservation, and all the respectful references in between to the unique rituals and beliefs of American Indians, this film is about the Navaho, and their contributions. How anyone can overlook this is beyond me.Thanks for reading.",5,Masterpiece Film Tribute to the Navaho Nation and Human Spirit,1367971200,"05 8, 2013",2013,1902,"['Most', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'be', 'missing', 'point', 'Windtalkers', 'graphic', 'terms', 'carnage', 'war', 'not', 'faint', 'hear', 'violence', 'not', 'done', 'sake', 'sensationalistic', 'violence', 'depiction', 'actual', 'combat.Throughout', 'film', 'main', 'story', 'IS', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'Navaho', 'Nation', 'who', 'were', 'primary', 'instrumental', 'victory', 'allies', 'Pacific', 'film', 'then', 'weaves', 'story', 'marines', 'who', 'later', 'work', 'including', 'racism', 'down-treatment', 'Navahos', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'who', 'ultimate', 'soldier', 'dedicated', 'orders', 'irony', 'fact', 'Navaho', 'efforts', 'helped', 'save', 'many', 'American', 'lives', 'people', 'who', 'belittled', 'ultimately', 'victory', 'current', 'generation', 'are', 'used', 'theater', 'wars', 'was', 'Big', 'One', 'World', 'War', 'where', 'fate', 'planet', 'depended', 'allies', 'global', 'domination', 'evil.Why', 'human', 'nature', 'wage', 'war', 'reviewer', 'sacrifice', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'holocaust', 'Europe', 'Japanese', 'POW', 'concentration', 'camps', 'as', 'recently', '1994', 'happened', 'over', 'again', 'genocide', 'murder', 'innocents', 'including', 'children', 'Bosnia', 'worst', 'atrocities', 'Srebrenicia.Still', 'film', 'testament', 'what', 'good', 'human', 'nature', 'worst', 'circumstances', 'also', 'ironies', 'Windtalkers', 'Navaho', 'unique', 'cultural', 'heritage', 'ultimatley', 'how', 'important', 'saving', 'heritage', 'proved', 'be', 'language', 'saved', 'West', 'beginning', 'film', 'reservation', 'end', 'back', 'reservation', 'respectful', 'references', 'unique', 'rituals', 'beliefs', 'American', 'Indians', 'film', 'Navaho', 'contributions', 'How', 'anyone', 'can', 'overlook', 'me.Thanks', 'reading']",N/A

Delli,"[0, 1]","Great movie, very realistic, and I completely disagree with the Navajos who posted negative reviews, but are factually rather superficial.1 - I believe the movie was not focused around Nicholas Cage's character much at all, in fact, we don't know much about him and his past at all (other than he's Italian and has an Italian last name), when in fact we DO know what the navajo characters did before the call of duty.2 - I strongly disagree that the movie should've focused on the ""origin"" of the code talkers, as it would have made it a much slower, far more boring movie, for the vast majority of the public. I believe when you decide to make a movie about WW2, you have to show the grim true reality of combat, for future generations to learn from. This movie (great director) shows combat scenes VERY realistically, and in my experienced -but humble- opinion, the best WW2 movies ever, are always the more realistic ones (Saving Private Ryan, Band Of Brothers, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, Schindler's List).Bottom line: there is no way that whoever watches this movie and has an IQ higher than average would intepret it as ""the code talkers were depicted as a back-burner"".

584140,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00005JK8K,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[1, 2]","Director John Woo knows how to best utilize actor Nicolas Cage, having worked with him in FACE/OFF; you give him very little dialogue. Cage does a great job playing a taciturn shell of a man, and he is very comfortable with the action scenes. Woo's epic-scale battle scenes are very well staged, full of roving dolly and crane shots swinging across a vast panorama of blood, steaming steel on mortar, tank, and artillary; flashing swords, bayonets and hunting knives, and the rolling red-orange fire clouds of huge explosions. Most of the action takes place on the home island of Saipan, with the Japanese troops dug in; tenacious frenzied fanatics. But the Japanese are shown as poor shots, easily duped, and easily defeated in hand-to-hand combat. They are slaughtered wholesale like cardboard cut-outs in a shooting range; kind of like the Indians in all those John Ford westerns; nearly faceless and soulless.The writing by John Rice and Joe Batteer is two-dimensional at best. The primary weakness of the script is that after finding the fabulous hook, the little known story of the Navajo code-talkers, they do not fully explore it. Some critics were unhappy with the Monument Valley prologue and epilogue, but actually they perfectly frame the training and battle scenes. Oddly, these early and late scenes seem to breathe in the world of 1944. They have nice texture, and a feel for the '40's. The rest of the film seems too contemporary. We know that our boys are fighting the Japanese, but it easily could have been the N.Koreans, or the N.Vietnamese.A good troupe of actors struggled with the shallow script. Nicolas Cage is very effective as the shell-shocked neurotic tortured Joe Enders. He spends a lot of time clicking his zippo lighter, smoking, and staring sad-eyed out into space; and it works for his character. Adam Beach, a veteran of several films about Native Americans, is excellent as Ben Yahzee. Yes, he smiles a lot, but never as a dolt; always from the heart, never insincere. He was a good man, who would transcend into a better man through the bloody cauldron of battle, through watching his friends die, through the killing of others. Roger Willie, as his buddy Charlie Whitehorse, who is a real Navajo, debuted in this film, and he made a solid impact. Again, this film missed out on ""classic"" status, because not enough time was given to these Indian characters. Cage's character becomes the Sgt. Rock of the piece, and instead Enders needed to be more peripheral, more secondary. Artistically, this did not need to be a Nicolas Cage picture. Of course, financially, I'm sure it was a different story. The movie would have soared if the Navajos had had more of the focus.Francis O'Conner, as the sympathetic nurse love-interest for Cage was gratuitous and wasted; a good actress tossed aside by poor plotting. Christian Slater as Pete ""Ox"" Anderson, found some effective screen time; breathing life into his cliche role; creating good moments out of nothing. His harmonica duets with Whitehorse's Indian flute could have been a much stronger motif, but it was handled poorly, and it got lost in the din, drown out by the staccato of machine guns. Peter Stormare, wild-eyed and thick-accented, found the pulse of his character, squad leader Sgt. Gunny Hjelmstad.One of the major plot twists involved orders to kill the Navajos rather than let them be captured, and possibly compromise the code. This could have been the stuff of drama, but it never really jelled. And why were these two valuable Windtalkers put in harm's way in the first place ? The film could have been much more powerful if we had known more about, and cared more about the Indian characters. Even the cliches regarding racism would have been better served if we had seen more of the story from the Navajo perspective.Perhaps some day, the Navajo's story will be more accurately depicted. It surely is a story worth telling. That story was only hinted at, and glossed over within this film. But despite the rough edges, this movie packed a solid punch, and it stirred the blood to sit through it.

584141,A7Y6AVS576M03,B00005JK8K,gobirds2,"[5, 9]","The new DVD only reinforces my initial response that WINDTALKERS is one of the best of the recent WWII movies filmed over the past few years. It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization.

One such favorite was ""Battle Cry"" (1955) staring the late Aldo Ray. In that film there is a cameo shot of a Native American sending a radio message that baffles a Japanese soldier intercepting the message who cannot understand the strange language he is hearing. My step-father, a navy veteran of the Pacific, told me that the Marines utilized ""indians"" (he did not specify Navajo) as radio operators because the Japanese could not understand their language (he also did not specify a ""code""). John Woo's ""Windtalkers"" finally brings to the silver screen an awareness of the Navajo code talkers who played such a vital role in winning some of the bloodiest campaigns in the Pacific during World War II. I used the word ""awareness"" instead of ""tribute"" because any tribute to these brave men was buried beneath the dramatic storyline of the movie.  The Navajo code talkers certainly deserve as fitting a tribute that other films depicting the contributions of American servicemen who were then considered racial minorities have bestowed on their subjects. Films such as ""Go For Broke"" [1951] (the story of the 442 Regimental Combat Team made up of Japanese-Americans, Neisai) and ""Tuskegee Airmen"" [1995] (the first fighter squadron comprised entirely of African-American piots) paid homage to these gallant, but, in 1940s America, socially unaccepted individuals. The Navajo ""Windtalkers"" did not get as good a voice as their African-American or Japanese-American comrades in John Woo's film.The plot centers around Sgt. Evers (Nicholas Cage), a tormented, battle fatigued marine who is assigned to protect Yahzee, a ""Windtalker"" (Adam Beach) and the code, no matter what. Christian Slater is also given the same assignment. Cage, who had previously gotten a squad of marines killed because he chose to follow orders to the letter, is excellent at portraying a man haunted by ghosts from the past. He is a loner, lives for the moment, avoids getting too close to people, including Beach, and goes berserk in combat, racking up the enemy body-count. Beach also does a fine acting job as Yahzee who must make the inevitable transition from naive patriotism to the horrible realities of war. Slater's character provides a contrast to Cage. He quickly becomes interested in Navajo culture, has plans for the future, and forms an emotional bond with his ""Windtalker,"" named Whitehorse. Slater is not at his best in this film. His performance is the weakest among the cast. When Whitehorse is killed by Evers to avoid the code talker's capture, Yahzee's transition is complete as he seeks revenge on the enemy by taking on the evil personae of his protector, Evers. The film contains big battle scenes that are well done except the pyrotechnics are so overdone it becomes annoying. Every explosion, including those from hand grenades produce huge gasoline explosions; their mushroom clouds rising to the heavens. Historically, the main battles take place on the Japanese island of Saipan in June, 1944. Although the film never mentions it, our platoon of Marines probably belonged to the 2nd Marine Division. The 2nd attacked a well dug in Japanese position on high ground fortified with artillery and tanks as accurately shown in the movie. An old modus operandi in war films was to keep the unit being portrayed anonymous as not to offend other units such as the 27th Infantry Division (Army) and 4th Marine Division that also fought bravely on Saipan. Woo resorted back to this old tactic, but managed to insert a superimposed map to show the battle's progress. The computer graphics of American dive-bombers supporting the Marines added great realism.Directors of war films today are faced with the dilemma of drama versus historical depiction. With ""Windtalker,"" Woo tried to combine both. Woo fulfilled his purpose but the Navajo code talkers deserve a better forum for their valiant efforts.

Okay, wait, not many people saw that last one, but I think the point is clear. This year, young though it may still be, has seen its share of war films. Following these excellent films is no easy task, especially given the public's growing numbness to this in-your-face genre. ""Windtalkers"" comes a day late and a dollar short, but at least it offers something that the others have not - John Woo. That name should speak volumes to those who follow the industry, because you can't expect realism with Woo onboard. However, you can expect a lot of action, and a lot of heart. The latter works well with ""Windtalkers,"" but John Woo's ballet of bullets and sparks is a little inappropriate for a film about World War II. The explosions and gunfights are more sexy than gritty, and realism goes right out the window. Still, the ever-increasing bodycount and deaths-by-friendly fire present the war as just hellacious enough so that the leaps, flips, and explosions don't become too offensive. At worst, one could label this film a tasteless miscalculation of what war is really like. At best, one could say it's a somewhat refreshing take on an overplayed genre. ""Black Hawk Down,"" perhaps the best film of its kind, demanded that something new be offered in the war films that followed - and yet ""We Were Soldiers"" offered more of the same (despite its many charms).

Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Band of Brothers, When Tumpets Fade, and We Were Soldiers are just a few of the amazing films out now.  Sadly Windtalkers will never match any of those films.  In fact I doubt you can even consider this film a ""War"" movie.  Sure it is about WWII and focuses on the battle in the Pacific versus the Japanese but the film pulls off nothing more than a shoot-em-up action flick.Windtalkers attempts to portray Nicholas Cage as a gung ho tough guy Marine who is in charge of escorting a Navajo ""codetalker"" in order to relay important information back to artillery, air strikes, etc... without the enemy breaking the code.  The plot is a unique storyline and a topic not too well discussed before but the director never fully accomplishes much that is compelling to the story.  Cage is his typical emotionless self and in my mind is a horrible actor.  He had no business being in this film but it is my theory that director John Woo needed a big named guy to sell the film.  Cage is flat throughout the entire film and never pulls off much to make his charater convincing.  He is supposed to be a man struggling with the loss of his entire squad and being the sole survivor.  He is supposed to be a strong old school military tough who is chosen to keep his ""codetalker"" safe and then subsequently kill him if the situation becomes precarious.  Because of this Cage decides he does not want to get too close to his ""codetalker"" since he may have to kill him.  But of course throughout the film Cage gets to know the ""codetalker"" and feels as though he could not kill him if the situation calls for it.  This plot line was expected and plays out exactly as one would expect.  No surprises at all here.  The problem is Cage has absolutely no emotion and never seems close to anything in the film not even his character.  The supporting cast, a roughshod bunch of Marines clumped to form his squad, also give horrible performances.  Woo tries to play out racism through these characters but the conflict is so forced it is not convincing at all.  The viewer never truly believes these Marines care that this guy is an indian at all.  Also the war time drama never really gets anywhere especially at night when they sit around and reminisce about regular life ""back home"" but these scenes are so choppy and flat that you can't seem to find any emotion in these guys.As for the action the film is impressive with it's effects.  Woo is noted for his exciting action films and Windtalkers is quite exciting.  The movie is dominated with intense combat scenes but realism is sacrificed for Hollywood flair.  Cage becomes a poor mans Rambo and virtually shoots from his hip the entire film.  Running through heavy fire men are dropping all around him and Cage simply sprays a few rounds and enemy soldiers drop all over.  The worst was when he falls and while another man is on top of him he reaches for his 45 and fires aimlessly at a hill and 7 Japanese soldiers go down dead.  What an impressive shot.  Basically the battles were extremely intense and filled with little triumphs that Hollywood loves so much but comparred to Ryan or Band of Brothers this film doesn't have a chance with realism.Overall I did not like this movie at all.  The only compelling performances were the two main Navajo's and Christian Slater.  The rest seemed like they had no clue what they were doing there and John Woo seems to have taken an interesting topic and crafted a cheesy action film around it.  Had this film been in the hands of Spielberg perhaps we would have been treated to a more convincing and more compelling war story instead of this laughable Rambo wannabe.",2,Not a convincing war film.

The primary interest should be in the Navajo Code Talkers, who, throughout the war, kept completely secret the code used, in the Navajo language - a code that was never once broken.Code talkers were to be killed by their Marine 'buddies', rather than allowed to be taken and tortured for information.  The Marines whose duty this was had a horrible responsibility - and they were told outright NOT to make friends with the Navajo men assigned to them, because one day they might have to kill them;  to ""save"" their fellow soldiers.  How does one not become close in a war?  Impossible.There is so very much horror in any war,  most of which our own civilians at home know absolutely nothing about.  How could we?The first time I ever saw this movie, I was stunned - never once having even heard about the code-talkers and their invaluable service to a Country which had persecuted them for so many, many generations.  Still, they volunteered.  Still, they went and were barely commended for their bravery and service.After seeing this film just once, I wrote to the Navajo Code Talkers Assn., (NCTA) to thank them.  My father and both uncles saw service, in Army, Navy and Air Force.  My elder brother was a Marine during the Korean war.  Only one Uncle saw active duty. The others did not.  In my email I thanked them, most humbly, for the amazing feats of bravery and loyalty they offered the Marin Corp.  Semper Fi, indeed.  They were such incredible heroes, along with - of course - many of our ""regular"" Marines.  Other units made up of ""men of color"" were also never acknowledged properly by this Country.  Shameful.  I was told by the NCTA my letter would be read aloud to the next gathering, which humbled me even more ... but it meant something to them.  I was not even born until 1949;  after WWII was over. But still ~In my opinion , this movie has an amazing impact when you look at it from the code talker perception.

It turns out she didn't leave because she thought I wanted to see it. Other than that, we would have both walked out of this boring, unbelievable, cliched, dull movie.The one good element of this movie is the attention to detail in the gear and uniforms of both sides.  Also, the Marines' Hymn was sung correctly: the Marines (while getting drunk) break out their song and sing ""We will fight our country's battles on the land and on the sea.""  Now, it's ""In the air, on land, and sea,"" because the Marines started using airpower.  This was a nice touch, but this movie deals with the invasion of Saipan, which happened in 1944.  The Marines' Hymn lyrics were changed to include airpower with the approval of the Commandant in 1942.  So, the movie was innacurate in this point though it was trying to be accurate.The Marines and Japanese uniforms and gear were all good.  I especially liked the Japanese 50mm knee mortar and the T14 ""Nambu"" 8mm light machine gun.  Both of these were excellent jungle fighting weapons, and are sadly missing from most war movies, though you get a good looksie here.Having said plenty about the nice details, lets review why the movie was bad.  The storyline in this movie was tragically bad, though it dealt with veeeery interesting material.  The US started using Navajo as code talkers because, by best estimates, there were no native Navajo speakers outside the US, and the language has long vowel clusters that are impossible to discern unless you learn the living language or grow up speaking the tongue.  The Japanese broke MANY American codes, but the Navajo code was simply impossible to penetrate.Also, the weapon effects in this movie were pretty unrealistic.  A bazooka making a bigger explosion than naval gunfire?  Speaking of which, why did they through in some vintage footage of battleships to show where the gunfire came from?  All the artillery explosions looked like blooming gasoline fires.  And how did Nick Cage waste like six Japanese with three shots?  With guys like him, no wonder the US won the war.Anyway, this movie is good for some details and showing weapons, but bad on storyline and realistic battles.  I would definitely wait for video.

The water was so clear you could see the crabs scuttling on the bottom fifty feet down.  The last time I was there was 55 years ago, on my way back to CLUSA after two years in China and on Guam, also in the Marianas.This was a good movie.  It centered around our Navajo code-talkers, which we used in WWII in the Islands.  Talking in their own language, they confounded the Japanese code breakers, and were quite effective.That's about where the realism ends in this movie.  It's true that the bullets flew fast and furious, and that many thousands of American Marines died on the beaches and in the jungles.  Some of the scenes here were obviously shot in the American Southwest.  There was no desert on Saipan, nor on its sister island, Guam.The most obvious innacuracy is the depiction by Nicolas Cage of a Marine sergeant standing up in plain sight, with a Thompson submachine gun holding a 20-round magazine, firing literally hundreds of rounds, mowing down Japanese soldiers (who also have weapons in their hands)like there was no tomorrow!  Man!  With two more guys like him we wouldn't have needed a Marine Corps!  They could've taken all the islands in the Pacific by themselves.  No wonder the code-talker he was assigned to protect (unless he had to kill him, depending on circumstances) stood around with his mouth open in amazement.Like all of the other movies that are trying to portray what that war was like, played by actors who have never seen combat, written by writers who have never seen combat, and directed by directors who have never seen combat, it is perhaps better than should be expected.I think that the best film of that era was a color documentary made by the Navy called &quot;The Fighting Lady,&quot; about the U.S.S. Enterprise, showing real men flying real airplanes, many of whom were actually killed in combat.  It was a propaganda movie made during the war.  Lt. Robert Taylor, USNR (remember him?) did the voice over.The best fiction depicting actual warfare was The Bridges at Toko-Ri, written by Michener, who actually spent time on the flattop with the men involved.  Of course the reason I like them is because they depicted Naval Aviation, which was my bag.  The problem with The Bridges is that the movie shows our jet fighters, the F9F Panthers, hitting the bridges, whereas the actual airplanes used (yes, such a battle was really fought) were propeller driven attack planes known as ADs.The lead was played by the late  William Holden, and the only inaccuracies devolved around his buddy-buddy relationship with an admiral who wasn't his father, and the portrayal of his wife (Grsce Kelly) coming to Japan to be with him.  A navy Lieutenant should be so lucky!But that's another movie.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie that accurately depicts a ground-pounder's life in action (and yes, I've seen Saving Private Ryan) Nor do I want to.

Yes, it's grim.  The bodyguards, Cage and Slater, are instructed to kill the windtalkers rather than let them fall into enemy hands.This is a big war movie, not quite on the scale of Saving Private Ryan, but somewhere between something that grand and magnificent and, say, Behind Enemy Lines.  Cage and Slater do a good job with their parts, which aren't very fully fleshed out characters.Woo's direction used to be so over-the-top and artsy... the fight scenes used to be like cartoons, with bad guy and good guy blazing away at each other with two pistols... the most violent scenes were often preceded by or accompanying flocks of birds taking to flight, and bullet-riddled bodies always seem to pirouet in slow motion before they fall down dead.  Woo has left a lot of the old personal director's style out of this one, actually.  There ARE a lot of bullets, and a lot of the fighting scenes are very unrealistic (true to old Woo there), and there is one scene very reminiscent of old John Woo, where a butterfly floats gracefully above a river then suddenly a bloody body falls into that river, destroying the gorgeous image, juxtaposing a graceful natural image with a gory violent one, etc.ANYWAY, mostly this is a shoot 'em up war movie, and the old John Woo style is MOSTLY absent.The story has that one feature going for it, the protection of the Navajo codetalkers, but otherwise it's a very standard war movie, in terms of plot.  Still, this movie comes off surprisingly well.If you're a fan of the American John Woo movies, like Broken Arrow, or Mission Impossible II or Face/Off, or you liked some movies recently like Black Hawk Down or Behind Enemy Lines, you ought to take a look at Windtalkers.

At a military hospital he regains his strength, but he suffers from permanent hearing loss and a damaged balance system.  However, a caring nurse helps him cheat on a hearing test, which enables him to regain his combative status.  His survival in combat is observed as useful by the Marine Crops and they assign him on a mission to protect the Navajo solider, Ben Yahzee, whose objective is to send code in his own language.  This code is an unsolved enigma for the Japanese forces, however, they are attempting to capture and torture anyone who knows the code in order to help themselves.  Thus, it is essential that Joe protects the code at all costs as they invade the island of Saipan.  Windtalkers is a fascinating story and the moral dilemma which Joe faces is equally interesting.  However, the score in the film is played all too frequently and it generates a cheesy atmosphere that seems contradictory to the dilemma.  In addition, there is some awkwardness in the combative scenes that resembles Achilles' godlike presence, which seems far fetched and similar to the shooting scenes in John Woo's earlier films.  The enemy also seems to be far too stupid, in comparison to what they really were, which diminish the feeling of realism.

This film fits the description. A travesty.  Let's just say that if the USMC actually fought the way Nick Cage and John Woo would have us believe, sushi would have become popular in this country 45 years sooner.  John Woo appears to think pyrotechnics make a movie.  To be honest I have not yet been able to sit through one of his movies without loosing interest in the first 20 minutes of non stop gunfire.This one makes a pretense of character development, but fails.  Better he stick to making bubble gum for the eye for today's attention challenged generation of video game players and leave making historically accurate films to others.  Yes, we owe a debt to the gallant Navahoe braves who fought and died in the war without any recognition till late, but they deserved better than to be trotted out for PR stints to promote this abortion.  I mean I thought Saving Private Ryan set new standards for realizm even with it's flaws.  But Mr Woo must have been sleeping during the period and learned his realism by watching reruns of ""The A' Team. His combat scenes are reminicent of the 1950's where the bad guys can'ts shoot straight enough to hit someone 30 feet away and guns never ran out of ammunition, and an empty ration box would stop a .50 caliber bullet.

584181,A16X61RLY1YJL7,B00005JK8K,"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[11, 16]","Windtalker's, in my opinion, is one of the best World War II Movies to come out in several years. I'm not normally a big Nicholas Cage fan; however, he does an absolutely wonderful job in this movie.  This film also does a wonderful job of showing exactly what the US Marine Corps is supposed to be used for and how a beach landing is performed.  The premise:  In the beginning of the movie we see Nicholas Cage's character in charge of his squad, their surrounded and being over run by the Japanese.  From that amazing scene we're taken to Hawaii where he's recovering, and then gets the assignment to guard the ""Windtalker.""  From there, we're taken back to the war in the Pacific.  What follows is an excellent and sometimes gut wrenching story about a Marine who has an extremely tough job to do and the internal conflict he has about that mission.  As I said before, this is certainly one of the best World War II movies to come out in some time and it's certainly the best one about the war in the Pacific in a great many years.The SPOILER paragraphs.  I've noticed that some of the other reviewers stated that they didn't understand what this movie was about.  They also said that it was nothing but blood, guts and just a lot of killing.  With all due respect to those reviewers, I'm not exactly sure what you expected when you sat down to watch this movie then, because blood, guts, gore and senseless killing is what war is all about, quite unfortunately.For those that didn't understand what this movie was about; maybe you have to be in or have been in the military to understand this one, I'm not sure.  First and foremost, the movie is about the suffering that Nicholas Cage's character goes through after his entire squad is killed and he's seriously injured.  As the squad leader who ended up in charge, he feels responsible for the death of his men and that he is the only one that survived.  He obviously has the whole gamut of emotions to go with it, to include a healthy portion of rage.  He take's that rage with him to Saipan and unleashes it on the Japanese there and in the same sense, becomes a heroic Marine, doing things that most people get killed quickly for.While suffering the emotional spectrum of his earlier combat experience, he's given the mission to protect the code.  The ideological thing to pay attention to here is, that it's the code he's assigned to protect, not specifically the bearer of that code.  That in and of itself is the inner turmoil that makes this movie and the character the winner that it is.  As a human, he has the ethical upbringing that is telling him that he shouldn't kill a fellow American, no matter what.  As a Marine though, he has the training that, by military law is supposed to supercede his ethical upbringing.  When he does actually have to kill one of them, pay attention to the fact that he doesn't care if he dies now.  This is an extremely emotional and gut wrenching movie that very clearly tells its story.  Nicholas Cage should at the very least, earn an Oscar nomination if not the award for his work on this film.",5,"""Windtalkers""",1035763200,"10 28, 2002",2002,3096,"['Windtalker', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Movies', 'come', 'out', 'several', 'years', ""'m"", 'not', 'normally', 'big', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'fan', 'however', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'job', 'movie', 'film', 'also', 'wonderful', 'job', 'showing', 'exactly', 'what', 'US', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'supposed', 'be', 'used', 'how', 'beach', 'landing', 'performed', 'premise', 'beginning', 'movie', 'see', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'character', 'charge', 'squad', 'surrounded', 'being', 'run', 'Japanese', 'amazing', 'scene', ""'re"", 'taken', 'Hawaii', 'where', 'recovering', 'then', 'assignment', 'guard', 'Windtalker', 'there', ""'re"", 'taken', 'back', 'war', 'Pacific', 'What', 'excellent', 'sometimes', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'story', 'Marine', 'who', 'extremely', 'tough', 'job', 'do', 'internal', 'conflict', 'mission', 'said', 'before', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'time', 'certainly', 'best', 'one', 'war', 'Pacific', 'great', 'many', 'years.The', 'SPOILER', 'paragraphs', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'other', 'reviewers', 'stated', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'also', 'said', 'was', 'nothing', 'blood', 'guts', 'just', 'lot', 'killing', 'due', 'respect', 'reviewers', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'expected', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'blood', 'guts', 'gore', 'senseless', 'killing', 'what', 'war', 'quite', 'unfortunately.For', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'maybe', 'have', 'be', 'have', 'been', 'military', 'understand', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'First', 'foremost', 'movie', 'suffering', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'character', 'entire', 'squad', 'killed', 'seriously', 'injured', 'squad', 'leader', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'charge', 'responsible', 'death', 'men', 'only', 'one', 'survived', 'obviously', 'whole', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'go', 'include', 'healthy', 'portion', 'rage', 'take', 'rage', 'Saipan', 'Japanese', 'same', 'sense', 'heroic', 'Marine', 'doing', 'things', 'most', 'people', 'get', 'killed', 'quickly', 'for.While', 'suffering', 'emotional', 'spectrum', 'earlier', 'combat', 'experience', 'given', 'mission', 'protect', 'code', 'ideological', 'thing', 'pay', 'attention', 'here', 'code', 'assigned', 'protect', 'not', 'specifically', 'bearer', 'code', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'movie', 'character', 'winner', 'human', 'ethical', 'upbringing', 'telling', 'should', ""n't"", 'kill', 'fellow', 'American', 'matter', 'what', 'Marine', 'training', 'military', 'law', 'supposed', 'supercede', 'ethical', 'upbringing', 'When', 'actually', 'have', 'kill', 'one', 'pay', 'attention', 'fact', ""n't"", 'care', 'now', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'movie', 'very', 'clearly', 'story', 'Cage', 'should', 'very', 'least', 'earn', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'not', 'award', 'work', 'film']",N/A
584182,A7PCBZV90G5U7,B00005JK8K,LaLoren,"[0, 4]","Like so many endeavors by American Indians,this was badly hurt by  good intentions from the uninformed. Many critics panned it because it was too much the story of Nicolas Cage's character, and not enough about the Navajo Code Talkers.  This, they seemed to assume, was taking advantage of the ""poor Native Americans"" who couldn't look out for themselves. They also criticized the many war movie cliches.However, if critics had taken the time to read American Indian publications prior to the movie's release, they would have realized that most American Indian groups were pleased with the movie, taking the much more pragmatic approach that this was a step toward mainstream appreciation of Native American themes and actors, that couldn't be acheived without a big name star and a popular genre.I would agree, that for my purposes, there was too much about the Cage character, but how many other folks would go to see Adam Beach and Roger Willy playing Navajo Code Talkers. As to being cliche, sure it was, in parts, but if you squeamishly skipped over the first scenes of ""Private Ryan,"" as I did, you'd notice that that movie had a lot of cliches too. I think the Native American themes and actors were as much a redeeming factor for this movie as the beach landing was for Private Ryan.As for the details, Nicolas Cage did what he's been doing a lot of lately.  He walked through his part. To his credit,he probably realizes that his role is simply to get people in to see movies they would normally ignore, It's a shame it didn't work here.Adam Beach is a creditable actor (though I thought he was better in Smoke Signals) and has a smile to die for. With a little more exposure this guy could be another Tom Cruise.By far the best job, though, was done by Roger Willie, a fellow who never acted before, and went to the auditions on a whim, at the suggestion of his sister-in-law. Willy brings a natural quality to the role that I hope leads to bigger and better parts in the futureThe movie does move a little too fast over what I thought were the more interesting issues, like what motivated these two characters to volunteer. I would have liked a little more of their home life and also some more detailed scenes of their training.A WWII movie without cliches is like a Western without horses and guns, but I thought the Native American themes of ceremonial healing and the warrior past, along with some good acting by the American Indian actors, made this worth seeing. And if more people had gone to see this ""hybrid"" of Native American and classic WWII themes, it might have opened a door for more popular acceptence of American Indian actors and movies.",4,Better than the critics say,1035763200,"10 28, 2002",2002,2666,"['so', 'many', 'endeavors', 'American', 'Indians', 'was', 'badly', 'hurt', 'good', 'intentions', 'uninformed', 'Many', 'critics', 'panned', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'character', 'not', 'enough', 'Navajo', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'seemed', 'assume', 'was', 'taking', 'advantage', 'poor', 'Native', 'Americans', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'out', 'also', 'criticized', 'many', 'war', 'movie', 'cliches.However', 'critics', 'had', 'taken', 'time', 'read', 'American', 'Indian', 'publications', 'prior', 'movie', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'realized', 'most', 'American', 'Indian', 'groups', 'were', 'pleased', 'movie', 'taking', 'much', 'more', 'pragmatic', 'approach', 'was', 'step', 'mainstream', 'appreciation', 'Native', 'American', 'themes', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'acheived', 'big', 'name', 'star', 'popular', 'genre.I', 'would', 'agree', 'purposes', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'Cage', 'character', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'folks', 'would', 'go', 'see', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'Roger', 'Willy', 'playing', 'Navajo', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'being', 'cliche', 'sure', 'was', 'parts', 'squeamishly', 'skipped', 'first', 'scenes', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'did', ""'d"", 'notice', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'cliches', 'too', 'think', 'Native', 'American', 'themes', 'actors', 'were', 'as', 'much', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'movie', 'beach', 'landing', 'was', 'Private', 'Ryan.As', 'details', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'did', 'what', 'been', 'doing', 'lot', 'lately', 'walked', 'part', 'credit', 'probably', 'role', 'simply', 'get', 'people', 'see', 'movies', 'would', 'normally', 'ignore', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'here.Adam', 'Beach', 'creditable', 'actor', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'smile', 'die', 'little', 'more', 'exposure', 'guy', 'could', 'be', 'Tom', 'Cruise.By', 'far', 'best', 'job', 'though', 'was', 'done', 'Roger', 'Willie', 'fellow', 'who', 'never', 'acted', 'went', 'auditions', 'whim', 'suggestion', 'sister-in-law', 'Willy', 'natural', 'quality', 'role', 'hope', 'leads', 'bigger', 'better', 'parts', 'futureThe', 'movie', 'move', 'little', 'too', 'fast', 'what', 'thought', 'were', 'more', 'interesting', 'issues', 'what', 'motivated', 'two', 'characters', 'volunteer', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'little', 'more', 'home', 'life', 'also', 'more', 'detailed', 'scenes', 'training.A', 'WWII', 'movie', 'cliches', 'Western', 'horses', 'guns', 'thought', 'Native', 'American', 'themes', 'ceremonial', 'healing', 'warrior', 'past', 'good', 'acting', 'American', 'Indian', 'actors', 'made', 'worth', 'seeing', 'more', 'people', 'had', 'gone', 'see', 'hybrid', 'Native', 'American', 'classic', 'WWII', 'themes', 'might', 'have', 'opened', 'door', 'more', 'popular', 'acceptence', 'American', 'Indian', 'actors', 'movies']",N/A

This movie is about Nicolas Cage and yes it is very Hollywood, but so is Saving Private Ryan. Big Deal..I like hollywood movies and you don't like it, then don't watch it. If you were smart enough to see who directed it, you would've knowned it would be action pack which is what you get with Cage smack in the middle of it. Besides, i thought he does a good job protecting his windtalker, considering what he want thru in his last battles before getting injured. I like to see you do better. The visual is very good with convincing realism in the fighting scenes. The plot is a lacking but that is not the director strong point, but he knows how to make a great action war film, and this movie accomplished it so admireably.If you like John Woo's Mission Impossible 2 action during a historic world war with excellent visual affects plus very grusome blood and body part scenes (on par with SPR Omaha Beach scene), then you will love this movie. If you prefer a good plot and more knowlegeble discussions on windtalkers, then read a book on it *roll eyes*.I love MI2, and i love this movie, but i will give it only 4 stars because i do agree, the plot could've been better. Let's not make Nicolas Cage as a big hero like John Wayne in the Green Barets because he is no John Wayne.

Adam Beach and Roger Willie, who are actually two Canadian Indians, play the roles of the Navajos.  It seems like an interesting twist on a formula war film.  And it certainly is.  But the film never does rise above the formula in spite of excellent acting.  John Woo, who's known for special effects, directs it.  This makes for great battle scenes that are easy to follow.  It spite of all the gunfire and hand grenade explosions, we always know where the central characters are.  The real story, however, is about the hard choices that Nicholas Cage has to make.  He's a fine actor and he does it well.  But isn't this film supposed to be about the Navajos?  Why then, did the film focus on the white actors?  The plot seemed implausible also.  Two Navajos were assigned to one small unit in the Solomon Islands.  As the Japanese are dug in there, they wouldn't have needed to speak in code to call airpower to the big guns.  It was obvious from the start that this was a Hollywood version of what could have been a really fine film.  There were so many inauthentic touches throughout  that I found myself somewhat amused.  The film did move quickly, however, and it did hold my interest.  But so what?  If the story seems wrong, the finest acting can't save it.

You get perhaps two minutes of ""life on the reservation"" as a group of Navajo Indians are brought in for special training. Their language is so complex that the army figures it will form the basis of an unbreakable code, one they can use without fear of being understood. There's a catch of course, as there are with all such codes - you can't let the key get into the enemy's hands. In this case, it means one of the Code Talkers can never be captured.Cage is a soldier assigned to protect one of these Navajos - Ben Yahzee (played by Adam Beach). He feels silly being a nurse-maid but also torn knowing that he might have to kill this man in cold blood. Other soldiers are less shy about how they feel. They actively look down on the Navajos as being inferior, and one even attacks him, claiming he could kill him because he ""looks like a Jap"".Directed by John Woo, you need to realize right up front that this isn't going to be a calm, collected view of war's emotional drama. There is a lot of Rambo-like blasting, a lot of nonsensical fighting without taking cover. Cage is not only stoical about his task - he is almost wooden in his lack of emotion.It's also a shame, for a movie which is all about the skill of the Navajos - that they end up being a side line in the story. I would have loved more introductory material, to introduce how the Navajos were living on their reservation, how they were treated there. I would have liked to see how they made their decisions to defend their country despite that prejudice. I would also have liked to see how they were treated when they returned. That would have really made it more a story about ""The Navajo Code Talkers"" and less about ""Nicholas Cage and his Sidekick Visit Japan"".I also couldn't understand *why* the code talkers were doing some of the tasks they were doing. Let's say they were radioing the position of the enemy, so the ships could fire on them. Why was this location a secret? Didn't the enemy know where their own troops were? It wasn't like they were radioing in ""We are about to sneak from position X to position Y"".Still, you can look at it from the point of view that at least SOMETHING was said about this most valuable contribution of the Navajos.

The story of code talkers AND of the terrible and tragic battle of Saipan in one movie - and they had Nicholas Cage, who, contrary to all his haters, is a good actor (remember a little movie called ""Moonstruck""?). But the way this film was made... oh, brother... I couldn't believe it.First, the director messed up a potentially passionate story by showing the recruitement, training and arrival of the Indian code talker to the front in possibly the dullest, colourless way possible. Expect a looooong introduction.Then, Nicholas Cage character was made in a depressed, half suicidal idiot. Good grief, he plays a man with a mission here, an intelligence officer, charged to protect an invaluable asset (the Indian code talker) - there is no way that in time of war somebody so depressed and dejected could be assigned such a mission. Except in direst of circumstances - and to invade Saipan US Marines and US Army had lots of ressources, including good officers.The fighting scenes on Saipan - they are exactly like in the worst Chuck Norris movies from the 80s. A short message to moviemakers in Hollywood: ""Hello, guys, Spielberg with ""Saving Private Ryan"" and Ridley Scott with ""Blackhawk Down"" already revisited war movies - and the kind of cheap stuff we were OK with before, we, the viewers, we do not buy it anymore"". I fully agree with some of the previous reviewers - in this film Japanese soldiers act like total morons, and they get killed by bushels from a single burst of machine gun. This is ridiculous. The fighting scenes on Solomon Islands in the opening scenes (featuring Nicholas Cage) are EVEN worse!The ending was supposed to be sad and touching - but at that moment I was so tired of ""Windtalkers"" that I was just relieved that it is over.I give this movie two stars just because I simply like Nicholas Cage, no matter how bad is the movie he is in. Also Adam Beach, the Canadian actor who comes from the Ojibwa nation, gives a great performance and he saves some scenes from the total disaster. But it is still a disaster.

584202,A2TBMX78M7PD5T,B00005JK8K,"Malvolio ""scott15724""","[20, 27]","Synopsis: In the Pacific theatre in World War II, the U.S. armed services developed a secure radio code based on the Navajo language. Navajo servicemen recruited as radio operators, or ""codetalkers,"" were assigned guards to protect them and the vital code they carried - or kill them if they were in imminent danger of capture by the Japanese. Windtalkers tells the story of Marine codetalker (Adam Beach) and the sergeant assigned to guard him (Nicholas Cage) as they participate in the invasion of Saipan. It also follows a similar relationship between another codetalker (Roger Willie) and his protector (Christian Slater).Joe Enders is a guy with a lot on his mind. First, there is the guilt. As a corporal in the Solomon Islands invasion, Enders abruptly inherited a small unit command when both his superiors were killed - and then just as quickly lost all his men in a Japanese counterattack. The lone survivor of the attack, he is sent to a naval hospital in Hawaii to recuperate, but he conceals a painful injury in order to return to combat. Instead of being allowed to return to the front lines, Joe is assigned to protect a wet-behind-the-ears codetalker named Ben Yahzee. Already traumatized by failing to save his old unit, Joe is in no mood to make friends with Ben, knowing that he might someday be forced to kill him in order to protect the code he carries. You know just where this movie is going.There's a point somewhere in Windtalkers when the viewer begins to ask questions. And that's not a good thing. Like, with about a bazillion Marines on Saipan, how come there aren't any officers? You've got a gunnery sergeant (Peter Stormare) running what appears to be about a battalion of guys. No knock on sergeants, but I don't think that's the way it's supposed to work, even in the Marine Corps. And at the end of the movie, when a couple hundred Marines with tanks, trucks, and such are getting the snot kicked out of them by Japanese artillery: why is it up to one lone codetalker - in an entirely different location, separated from his radio and pinned down under fire - to call in an air strike? You mean to tell me there isn't a single radio in that whole convoy of beleaguered grunts? How are they communicating with each other, semaphore? I guess that's what happens when you don't have any officers around.And there are other questions that are ultimately more ruinous to the success of this movie. What is the story about? The codetalkers? Joe Enders? The contrasting relationships between the codetalkers and their protectors? The conquest of Saipan? And how does any sort of relationship develop between Enders and the people in his life when he doesn't say two words to anyone? Early in the movie, the obligatory beautiful nurse (Frances O'Connor) falls for Joe, cares for him, pursues him with unanswered letters throughout the rest of the film - and he never gives her the time of day. Why does she bother? For that matter, it's hard to see why anyone does anything they do in this picture. Characters turn about-face in attitude and behavior so often at the whim of the plot that there must have been a minor epidemic of whiplash during the filming.Even that wouldn't be such a bad thing if the plot were worth all the contrivances necessary to advance it. Unfortunately, Windtalkers is an encyclopedia of the hoariest war movie cliches: the haunted soldier who watched others die due to his mistakes; the medical condition (call it ""Old Movie Disease"") that debilitates the hero while somehow allowing him to fight on; the bigoted antagonist who is brought around to see the light; the young newcomer who proves his worth to the unit by an act of stupendous bravery; and so on.Windtalkers is cliched visually as well. War films like Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, and HBO's Band of Brothers have raised the bar when it comes to realism and viewer involvement. In their wake, John Woo's trademark pyrotechnic style seems dated, even quaint, and his material trivial.The biggest problem with Windtalkers, though, is Nicholas Cage. Cage is capable of being a very fine actor with a good emotional range, as evidenced by roles in movies as varied as Leaving Las Vegas and Moonstruck. Here, though, he seems clearly uncomfortable in a monotonous, clench-jawed performance as Joe Enders. The script, by John Rice and Joe Batteer, is execrable; but a lower-key actor like Billy Bob Thornton could probably have redeemed it somewhat by injecting a bit more nuance than Cage can summon. The rest of the casting is uneven as well, with Stormare particularly distracting as a Swede trying to fake an American accent.The wartime contribution of the Navajo codetalkers is interesting grist for a movie. It's too bad Windtalkers doesn't come near to doing it justice.",1,Duck!,1034812800,"10 17, 2002",2002,4796,"['Synopsis', 'Pacific', 'theatre', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'U.S.', 'armed', 'services', 'developed', 'secure', 'radio', 'code', 'based', 'Navajo', 'language', 'Navajo', 'servicemen', 'recruited', 'radio', 'operators', 'codetalkers', 'were', 'assigned', 'guards', 'protect', 'vital', 'code', 'carried', 'kill', 'were', 'imminent', 'danger', 'capture', 'Japanese', 'Windtalkers', 'story', 'Marine', 'codetalker', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'sergeant', 'assigned', 'guard', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'participate', 'invasion', 'Saipan', 'also', 'similar', 'relationship', 'codetalker', 'Roger', 'Willie', 'protector', 'Christian', 'Slater', '.Joe', 'Enders', 'guy', 'lot', 'mind', 'First', 'guilt', 'corporal', 'Solomon', 'Islands', 'invasion', 'Enders', 'abruptly', 'inherited', 'small', 'unit', 'command', 'when', 'superiors', 'were', 'killed', 'then', 'just', 'quickly', 'lost', 'men', 'Japanese', 'counterattack', 'lone', 'survivor', 'attack', 'sent', 'naval', 'hospital', 'Hawaii', 'recuperate', 'painful', 'injury', 'order', 'return', 'combat', 'Instead', 'being', 'allowed', 'return', 'front', 'lines', 'Joe', 'assigned', 'protect', 'wet-behind-the-ears', 'codetalker', 'named', 'Ben', 'Yahzee', 'Already', 'traumatized', 'failing', 'save', 'old', 'unit', 'Joe', 'mood', 'make', 'friends', 'Ben', 'knowing', 'might', 'someday', 'be', 'forced', 'kill', 'order', 'protect', 'code', 'know', 'just', 'where', 'movie', 'point', 'somewhere', 'Windtalkers', 'when', 'viewer', 'ask', 'questions', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'bazillion', 'Marines', 'Saipan', 'how', 'come', 'are', ""n't"", 'officers', ""'ve"", 'got', 'gunnery', 'sergeant', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'running', 'what', 'be', 'battalion', 'guys', 'knock', 'sergeants', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'way', 'supposed', 'work', 'even', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'couple', 'hundred', 'Marines', 'tanks', 'trucks', 'such', 'are', 'getting', 'snot', 'kicked', 'Japanese', 'artillery', 'why', 'one', 'lone', 'codetalker', 'entirely', 'different', 'location', 'separated', 'radio', 'pinned', 'down', 'fire', 'call', 'air', 'strike', 'mean', 'tell', ""n't"", 'single', 'radio', 'whole', 'convoy', 'beleaguered', 'grunts', 'How', 'are', 'communicating', 'other', 'semaphore', 'guess', 'what', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'officers', 'around.And', 'are', 'other', 'questions', 'are', 'ultimately', 'more', 'ruinous', 'success', 'movie', 'What', 'story', 'codetalkers', 'Joe', 'Enders', 'contrasting', 'relationships', 'codetalkers', 'protectors', 'conquest', 'Saipan', 'how', 'sort', 'relationship', 'develop', 'Enders', 'people', 'life', 'when', ""n't"", 'say', 'two', 'words', 'anyone', 'Early', 'movie', 'obligatory', 'beautiful', 'nurse', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'Joe', 'cares', 'unanswered', 'letters', 'rest', 'film', 'never', 'time', 'day', 'Why', 'bother', 'matter', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'anyone', 'anything', 'do', 'picture', 'Characters', 'turn', 'about-face', 'attitude', 'behavior', 'so', 'often', 'whim', 'plot', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'minor', 'epidemic', 'whiplash', 'filming.Even', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'plot', 'were', 'worth', 'contrivances', 'necessary', 'advance', 'Unfortunately', 'Windtalkers', 'encyclopedia', 'hoariest', 'war', 'movie', 'cliches', 'haunted', 'soldier', 'who', 'watched', 'others', 'die', 'due', 'mistakes', 'medical', 'condition', 'call', 'Old', 'Movie', 'Disease', 'hero', 'somehow', 'allowing', 'fight', 'bigoted', 'antagonist', 'who', 'brought', 'see', 'light', 'young', 'newcomer', 'who', 'worth', 'unit', 'act', 'stupendous', 'bravery', 'on.Windtalkers', 'cliched', 'visually', 'as', 'well', 'War', 'films', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'HBO', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'have', 'raised', 'bar', 'when', 'realism', 'viewer', 'involvement', 'wake', 'John', 'Woo', 'trademark', 'pyrotechnic', 'style', 'dated', 'even', 'quaint', 'material', 'trivial.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Windtalkers', 'though', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Cage', 'capable', 'being', 'very', 'fine', 'actor', 'good', 'emotional', 'range', 'evidenced', 'roles', 'movies', 'as', 'varied', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Moonstruck', 'Here', 'though', 'clearly', 'uncomfortable', 'monotonous', 'clench-jawed', 'performance', 'Joe', 'Enders', 'script', 'John', 'Rice', 'Joe', 'Batteer', 'execrable', 'lower-key', 'actor', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'redeemed', 'somewhat', 'injecting', 'bit', 'more', 'nuance', 'Cage', 'can', 'summon', 'rest', 'casting', 'uneven', 'as', 'well', 'Stormare', 'particularly', 'distracting', 'Swede', 'trying', 'fake', 'American', 'accent.The', 'wartime', 'contribution', 'Navajo', 'codetalkers', 'interesting', 'grist', 'movie', 'too', 'bad', 'Windtalkers', ""n't"", 'come', 'doing', 'justice']",N/A
584203,A1D2AXVN20OQZD,B00005JK8K,Marc A. Coignard,"[1, 4]","Seriously, sometimes while watching this movie I fealt like it was the Pacific war version of Saving Private Ryan.  It had its good points, don't get me wrong, but in the end the story behind this movie is over-dramatic fluff.  The idea is a good one...hell, its a great idea for a film!  The true story about how the Navajo language was used as a code against the Japanese in WWII?  I'm surprised no one had tried this before (or have they, and I'm just ignorant about it?).  Even with the good acting, and amazing battle scenes (still not as graphic as SPR, but still quite good), it falls WAY short of its intended mark.The backdrop of the story is, of course, the use of Navajo's and their language to help win WWII.  The actual story in the film, however, centers on two Marines, played by Nic Cage and Chris Slater, who are ordered to protect two Navajo code talkers (two actors who's names I didn't catch...sorry).  Thats all well and good, but it gets really kinda sappy and melodramatic, and it feels a lil too much like we're watching a Hollywood movie, and not enough like we're watching a serious war story about an important part of American history that is long overlooked.  The comparrison of this movie to Saving Private Ryan come from the fact that Cage has to do everything he can to protect the life of a younger soldier.  The main differences here are that its through the whole movie and not just the last 30 mins, as in Private Ryan, and in this story if the Navajo is caught, the protector must kill him to protect the code.Anyway, I think if you watch this movie you'll pick up on what I'm getting at.

584208,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00005JK8K,Martin Asiner,"[0, 0]","There were two big budget war films of 2002--WINDTALKERS and WE WERE SOLDIERS.  The latter was unquestionably the finer of the two even though both had similar action sequences.  What differentiates them was the presence and careful development of the theme of soldierly solidarity that was present in WE WERE SOLDIERS.  Director John Woo stamps WINDTALKERS with his trademark over the top battle sequences of explosions, bullets flying, and bodies leaping.  Nicholas Cage is Sergeant Enders, a man who is scarred mentally and physically even before the main action of the film begins.  He alone has survived while his full platoon had been killed by the Japanese during World War II.  He carries what he believes to be the scarlet letter of guilt on his burned ears and within his soul which requires frequent sake to soothe over if only for the moment.  There is the hint of a romance with a navy nurse that intrudes in rather than enlarges upon his daily struggle to find equanimity.  Of far more interest is his relation with a Navajo marine (Adam Beach)who is a 'codetalker,' one who speaks in a cryptic variation of his native Navaho tongue to confound eavesdropping English-speaking radio listeners.  Enders and his Navajo share more than a buddy relation.  As if Enders has not enough guilt to carry, he is ordered to shoot the Navajo if the Japanese are likely to take him prisoner and have the opportunity to torture him to learn the code.  It is precisely here that WINDTALKERS goes seriously astray.  Why would the top brass go to the trouble of training valuable codebreakers only to expose them at every chance to possible death or capture?  Further, there are several scenes in which the Navajos use the code in situations that do not require code.  In fact, had plain English been used in those situations, it is arguable that fewer American casualties would have resulted.  What director Woo gives the viewer is a slam-bang action war film that delivers a high body count but a low level of logic.

It is far below the standards of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or WE WERE SOLDIERS, but I found the John Woo movie quite touching and involving.  Haven't we come to expect cliches in war movies?  What do you want? Soldiers who spout Shakespeare or have some deep philosophical beliefs?  Dwarves?  I found the cliches in WINDTALKERS the usual, but the actors bringing them to life did so with such finesse I found them interesting.  Sure, we've been there and seen them all before, but life is full of repetitious, tedious people.  The usual bigotry, honor, loyalty, fear, anger, frustration are evidenced in this movie.  Woo, most known for his non-stop over the top actioners, tries a different approach in this one, and while it may not be his best work, it's a different view of this talented director.  While Oscar winner Nicholas Cage is adequate in his role, the movie's best performances come from the supporting cast:  Adam Beach, Roger Willie, Brian van Holt, Noah Emmerich, Martin Henderson, and Mark Ruffalo are great in their roles.A little long, but wasn't the war long?

It is a story that very definitely needs to be told. If I were going to tell this story in the best format, it would have been a ""Band of Brothers"" type format with the real veterans being interviewed at the start of each episode. The movie should have a real gut feeling for the experience, like ""Band of Brothers."" The same treatment of this story would have made for an exceptionally good movie. The closest this movie comes to this standard is the Native American actors.  Their camaraderie felt real, as off screen it probably is real.I also have to credit the excellent traditional Native American flute playing. Thanks must go to National Geographic for a excellent documentary of the same topic as a follow up to the release of this movie ( 5 stars in my book). The movie alienated me from the first extremely fake battle scene, and it was hard to recover. A Japanese soldier chops off the hand of an American, who has it placed and motionless conveniently on a log. This is followed by a cheap Prom date scream. An American hoses the area with a machine gun and Japanese soldiers eager to die jump into the line of fire. I never heard of this form of ""Sepukoo"" before. Maybe they were embarassed to be in such a bad action sequence? To be fair, the action sequences improve the farther into the story that you get.  However, at times, it feels like the script is being written specifically  to chain together the action scenes.  John Woo continues to do films with excessive violence.  A contrast would be the ""designer action"" sequences of Corey Yuen in ""Kiss of the Dragon"" or ""The Transporter.""  Corey has my vote for best action director.  In terms of Nicholas Cage's long and interesting acting career, ""Corelli's Mandolin"" can be used as a contrast to when he is really putting his heart into his acting.

584226,A33TBHM3O9AY17,B00005JK8K,No one of consequence,"[3, 4]","I was drawn to this movie initially because it's about WW2 and, well, I watch just about everything I can get on the subject.  From the opening scenes, the tone is set for gritty action and graphic violence, both of which characterize every combat sequence in the movie.The story revolves around Sgt. Joe Enders (Nicholas Cage), who is assigned to protect Ben Yahzee, a young and naive Navajo &quot;code talker&quot;.  Enders is carrying both physical and psychological scars from an earlier encounter with the Japanese that left him as the sole survivor after his squad was wiped out.  He is portrayed as a quiet, sullen, and downright hard character.  His no-nonsense demeanor and brutality in combat is contrasted by Yahzee's youthful freshness and healthy fear of enemy bullets.  The two make a very unlikely pair, to say the least.The other main characters are Sgt. Anderson (played by Christian Slater), whose charge is another code talker named Charlie Whitehorse, an older Navajo whose traditional roots run deep.  Anderson is much more light hearted and conversational than Enders, having not shared the same hard combat experiences.  Both sergeants, however, have a common mission -- &quot;protect the code at all costs,&quot; which is translated as &quot;kill your code talker if he is in danger of being captured.&quot;  There are a couple suspenseful scenes where the sergeants are put to the test on whether to carry out this order -- 'nuff said.With this stage set, the story carries forward as a depiction of four different men thrown into a common crisis, each dealing with it in his own way but unavoidably influenced by those around him.  Generally speaking, the action is riveting, intense and realistic, and definitely does not glamorize war.  Rather, it puts a horrific face on it in a way that has become much more the norm since the advent of films like &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; and, more recently, &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot;  Several of the combat scenes are absolutely sweeping (epic?) in their scale, and do a great job of capturing the magnitude of some of these large military operations.My only criticisms would be these:  first, the Marines' ability to dodge bullets while mowing down their enemies with return fire (compared to the lack of such ability in their Japanese counterparts) was unrealistic -- just a little Rambo-esque.  Second, the characters of the code talkers were a bit underdeveloped and even somewhat stereotyped.

584227,A29ZTW8IH9S5WR,B00005JK8K,Noonie Fortin,"[1, 1]","Have any of you seen this film? It was awesome but left a lot to be desired at the same time. It was loud with lots of action, war violence, and graphic scenes. It was loud as war films are. Some scenes were reminiscent of the first half-hour of &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot;It was billed as being about the Navajo codetalkers of WW II-and yet I found there was little in the film about them even though there were two main characters who were suppose to be codetalkers.The movie began with a battle scene in the Solomon Islands. The Marines were outnumbered and all but one survived this particular battle that was shown. Next Nicholas Cage, who portrayed Corporal (CPL) Joe Enders from Pennsylvania, was recuperating in a hospital in Hawaii. A Navy WAVE, played by Frances O'Connor, who cared for him helped him return to the front lines and yet he didn't appear to have any feelings for her. Throughout the rest of the film she sends him letters to which he never responds.The film jumped to a group of Navajo enlisting into the Corps. Next they were going to class where they studied the code they would use. There was little really shown about their actual training. We know that they used their own language as a code the Japanese never broke during WW II. Here the audience is introduced to two Navajo: Ben Yahzee, played by Adam Beach, and Charlie Whitehorse-portrayed by Roger Willie making his acting debut. Both Adam and Roger are Native American Indians although Adam was born in Canada.CPL Enders is given a special mission. He is to protect with his own life if necessary the life of the Navajo assigned to him and at all costs protect the code-in other words kill the Navajo if the enemy gets too close or captures him. At the same time he is promoted in rank to sergeant. He meets Sergeant (SGT) Anderson, played by Christian Slater. They have opposites outlooks on life but the same mission which neither are sure they can fulfill.There was little shown in the movie about the relationship between the Navajo and the rest of the Marines. Except for a scene where one Marine assaulted Yahzee the rest of the film simply showed them being called names. SGT Anderson befriended Charlie. They even began playing music together, the Navajo on the flute and Slater using a harmonica. They struck a true friendship.As much as I like Nicholas Cage and his films I felt like he was the vehicle for this movie and not the codetalkers. SGT Enders stayed aloof to forming a relationship with Yahzee. Perhaps it was that his platoon was cut to shreds in the first scenes of the movie. Perhaps he didn't want to become friends because he had orders to kill Yahzee if the enemy got too close to him. Perhaps he felt as though he didn't want to befriend another soldier. BUT I felt that Cage had too much screen time when I thought the movie was suppose to be about the Navajo.The main thrust of the movie was supposed to be a battle on the island of Saipan in 1944. The American forces knew there were over 30,000 Japanese on the island and yet they attacked. It was yet another brutal battle from one end of the island to the other. Particularly disturbing was a friendly fire incident even though I know those things happened all too often.But the few scenes of the Navajo using their codetalking was what the movie was suppose to be about. Maybe I didn't see it-I'm not sure now. Yes the Navajo used their radios to call in information to higher headquarters. They passed along info regarding locations, quantities, units, etc. Sometimes they chattered among themselves since no one else could understand them including their counterparts-the Americans.There were breathtaking scenes in the film. I admit to shedding tears during it. It was a good movie but I expected to see more of exactly what the Navajo did. However I will say that what &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; did for the WW II generation and &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; did for the Vietnam generation &quot;Windtalkers&quot; tries to do for our Native Americans who served during WW II in our Armed Forces. Their code was never broken. They deserved more credit than they received at the time and even since then. This movie was to be their vehicle for that acceptance.",3,Too much Nicolas--not enough Code Talkers,1075334400,"01 29, 2004",2004,4243,"['Have', 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'awesome', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'loud', 'lots', 'action', 'war', 'violence', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'was', 'loud', 'war', 'films', 'are', 'scenes', 'were', 'reminiscent', 'first', 'half-hour', 'quot', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan.', 'quot', 'was', 'billed', 'being', 'Navajo', 'codetalkers', 'WW', 'II-and', 'yet', 'found', 'was', 'little', 'film', 'even', 'were', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'suppose', 'be', 'codetalkers.The', 'movie', 'began', 'battle', 'scene', 'Solomon', 'Islands', 'Marines', 'were', 'outnumbered', 'one', 'survived', 'particular', 'battle', 'was', 'shown', 'Next', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Corporal', 'CPL', 'Joe', 'Enders', 'Pennsylvania', 'was', 'recuperating', 'hospital', 'Hawaii', 'A', 'Navy', 'WAVE', 'played', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'who', 'cared', 'helped', 'return', 'front', 'lines', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'feelings', 'rest', 'film', 'letters', 'never', 'responds.The', 'film', 'jumped', 'group', 'Navajo', 'enlisting', 'Corps', 'were', 'going', 'class', 'where', 'studied', 'code', 'would', 'use', 'was', 'little', 'really', 'shown', 'actual', 'training', 'know', 'used', 'own', 'language', 'code', 'Japanese', 'never', 'broke', 'WW', 'II', 'Here', 'audience', 'introduced', 'two', 'Navajo', 'Ben', 'Yahzee', 'played', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'Charlie', 'Whitehorse-portrayed', 'Roger', 'Willie', 'making', 'acting', 'debut', 'Adam', 'Roger', 'are', 'Native', 'American', 'Indians', 'Adam', 'was', 'born', 'Canada.CPL', 'Enders', 'given', 'special', 'mission', 'protect', 'own', 'life', 'necessary', 'life', 'Navajo', 'assigned', 'costs', 'protect', 'code-in', 'other', 'words', 'kill', 'Navajo', 'enemy', 'too', 'close', 'same', 'time', 'promoted', 'rank', 'sergeant', 'Sergeant', 'SGT', 'Anderson', 'played', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'have', 'opposites', 'outlooks', 'life', 'same', 'mission', 'are', 'sure', 'can', 'fulfill.There', 'was', 'little', 'shown', 'movie', 'relationship', 'Navajo', 'rest', 'Marines', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'Marine', 'assaulted', 'Yahzee', 'rest', 'film', 'simply', 'showed', 'being', 'called', 'names', 'SGT', 'Anderson', 'befriended', 'Charlie', 'even', 'began', 'playing', 'music', 'together', 'Navajo', 'flute', 'Slater', 'using', 'harmonica', 'struck', 'true', 'friendship.As', 'much', 'like', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'films', 'felt', 'was', 'vehicle', 'movie', 'not', 'codetalkers', 'SGT', 'Enders', 'stayed', 'aloof', 'forming', 'relationship', 'Yahzee', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'platoon', 'was', 'cut', 'shreds', 'first', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'become', 'friends', 'had', 'orders', 'kill', 'Yahzee', 'enemy', 'got', 'too', 'close', 'Perhaps', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'befriend', 'soldier', 'BUT', 'felt', 'Cage', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'when', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'Navajo.The', 'main', 'thrust', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'battle', 'island', 'Saipan', '1944', 'American', 'forces', 'knew', 'were', 'over', '30,000', 'Japanese', 'island', 'yet', 'attacked', 'was', 'yet', 'brutal', 'battle', 'one', 'end', 'island', 'other', 'Particularly', 'disturbing', 'was', 'friendly', 'fire', 'incident', 'even', 'know', 'things', 'happened', 'too', 'few', 'scenes', 'Navajo', 'using', 'codetalking', 'was', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'about', 'Maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'it-I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'now', 'Yes', 'Navajo', 'used', 'radios', 'call', 'information', 'higher', 'headquarters', 'passed', 'along', 'info', 'regarding', 'locations', 'quantities', 'units', 'etc', 'Sometimes', 'chattered', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'understand', 'including', 'counterparts-the', 'Americans.There', 'were', 'breathtaking', 'scenes', 'film', 'admit', 'shedding', 'tears', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'expected', 'see', 'more', 'exactly', 'what', 'Navajo', 'did', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'what', 'quot', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'quot', 'did', 'WW', 'II', 'generation', 'quot', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'quot', 'did', 'Vietnam', 'generation', 'quot', 'Windtalkers', 'quot', 'tries', 'do', 'Native', 'Americans', 'who', 'served', 'WW', 'II', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'code', 'was', 'never', 'broken', 'deserved', 'more', 'credit', 'received', 'time', 'even', 'then', 'movie', 'was', 'be', 'vehicle', 'acceptance']",N/A

584229,A3U4VUSBJMR5KP,B00005JK8K,Patrick A. Hayden,"[7, 9]","I came into this film with high expectations.  John Woo is one of my favorite directors, and he was re-teaming with the man he got the best performance out of in all of his American films, Nic Cage in ""Face/Off"".  Add that to my love of war films, and I thought this would be a winner.Sadly, the film dissapoints on nearly every level.  The opening, showing Cage leading a doomed patrol, looks like it was filmed on a soundstage, and is so poorly acted and shot that I had to wonder if Woo had somehow turned the reigns over to Joel Schumaker.  Anyway, back to the story.Cage recovers, and eventually is assigned to protect a ""codetalker"", a Navajo Indian who's language has been used by the Marines as a code that the Japaneses cannot break.  Cage's orders:protect the code at all costs, even if it means killing his comrade in arms if he is in danger of being captured.  Cage's codetalker, Ben Yahzee, is amiably played by Adam Beach, and the most interesting parts of trhe story are how Yahzee and his fellow Navajo are trained and how they interact with those who are assigned to protect them.  Sadly, not much of this interaction is shown, as Woo goes so far over the top in the battle scenes, both in scale and level of heroics, that you have to wonder if six people took down the Japanese all by themselves against incredible odds.Other negatives include the cliched ""Minority soldier challenged by racist comrade"" subplot, that is resolved just as predictably as you might think.  The score is also way over the top, with James Horner seeming to forget all the lessons he learned from his Star Trek scoring to his work on Titanic.  In all the film is John Woo's worst, worse even than ""Mission: Impossible 2"", which is hard to top.  I worry about Woo now, as he's only made two entertaining American films, ""Face/Off"" & ""Hard Target(For Van Damme, it's fun), and only ""Face/Off"" is on par with his Hong Kong films.

'Harts War' did the same thing.After that, cliches abound, accuracy to any typical Pacific-Island tactical war situation that Im familiar with eludes  me, and consists of Japanese soldiers repeatedly springing -out individually or in small group, charging yelling down little hills and being over and over again put away with Chicago choppers.  (Like a Japanese imitation of the old 'Combat'TV-show Germans) Caje doesnt really work even in casting, doesnt really know how to go about portraying the cliched stressed-out traumatised veteran, to be fair he probably gets about as far as expected with a 50s pedestrian script and a director who by the sound of his name cut his teeth on Hong-Kong chop-sockey movies, and if it had Kung-Fu instead of rifles artillery and bayonette charges, this would actually be an above-average contribution to that genre. He must have been instinctively- tempted to make greater use of the sword-wielding Japanese-officers.The two Native-Americans and their knife-fights hand-to-hand with the Japanese troops are actually well-done and a highlight in a low dark landscape, , theres that martial-arts film experience shining again.( Was this revenge for the Japanese Samurai that messed up all those native-American warriors  in the cornfield in that cool Charles Bronson-Toshiro Mifune western  years ago?)Sets and costumes are ok, credit where its due, the Japanese strong-points with a camouflaged period field-gun look about right.Like 'U-571' and  'Harts War', ok for keeping the kids out of your hair for a couple of hours.

584233,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B00005JK8K,Ping Lim,"[7, 9]","I have been John Woo's avid fan for years.  I have been following his works since his directorial effort in HK namely, &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; starring Chow Yuen Fatt.  John Woo is a very good story teller especially when it involves the unspoken honour of brotherhood, the final showdown between the good &amp; the bad (especially when one's wittiness is matched by the other's deviousness).  Compounded by his signature-style slow motion sequence, we have modern classic action movies in the making.  Among his works in Hollywood, he was at his best in MI2 starring Tom Cruise, Face Off starring Nicholas Cage &amp; John Trovolta, Broken Arrow starring John Trovolta &amp; Christian Slater.  Other works of his such as Hard Target starring Jean Claude Van Demme is rather pedestrian.  I'm sad to say that Windtalkers belongs to the latter category.  Mind you, this is John Woo's first exposure to combat movie.  When his work is to be compared with Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan or even HBO's special, Band of Brothers, Windtalkers doesn't fare so well.  John tries to squeeze as much action packed sequence into the movie &amp; not compromising upon the character building exercise.  All I can say is that there is too much battle repetition, &amp; all characters in the movie are two-dimensional.  In the end, when the main characters are slowly been killed off by those faceless Japanese soldiers, we don't feel for them.  I'm feeling sorry for Nicholas Cage &amp; Christian Slater as they are trying hard to save this movie from sinking further.  Nicholas has got a demented face the whole time &amp; one can't help but wonder if he's playing his character or if he's doubting his involvement in this movie.  The actors who played the Navajo's codebreakers are genuine &amp; fresh in their roles &amp; they are convincing in their performance.

Just check his directorial resume to find some of the most explosively imaginative films to hit American theaters.  John Woo struggles a bit with emotions that don't culminate in a roundhouse punch or bazooka blast.  While ""Windtalkers"" has plenty of each, the heart of the story holds a good deal of untapped drama that would have vaulted this film from good to fantastic.A recent WWII-era of note, ""Saving Private Ryan"", had some grimly realistic (and let's face it, eye-popping) battle scenes, but what really drew the audience in was the humanity of the small troop accomplishing something heroic.  In contrast, ""Windtalkers"" somehow misses the mark of making the audience walk a mile in its characters' shoes.  The well casted crew creates an adequate atmosphere, but the script kept them more-or-less in caricature-mode.  With his keen facial inflections, Nicolas Cage imbues depth to a rather flatly written part, but again, he wasn't given much to work with.The battle scenes are impressive, but after the third Rambo-esque shoot-em-up session (one man, one machine-gun, lots of dead bad-guys), you might start to think, ""I've seen this before.""  John Woo didn't seem to tap his full creative ""action"" reserve here, even during the armed conflicts.  Many fans have grown to hold pretty high expectations for Mr. Woo, and until now, he's always delivered above-and-beyond.  In the case of ""Windtalkers"" action sequences, the word ""adequate"" comes mind.After the film was finished, I felt only partially satisfied.  While the movie is entertaining, the code talkers are ultimately peripheral players in the Cage character's struggle.  I wasn't hoping for a documentary on Navajo Code Talkers, but more focus on them in a movie about them would have been more fulfilling.Note on the DVD:  the ""extras"" on my version are nearly nonexistent.  They include two trailers for ""Windtalkers"", a trailer for another film, and text credits for the DVD production crew.  For a historically based film, the least they could have added was a short PBS-esque documentary on actual code talkers.  Something...

584235,A319YRDK8Y39N,B00005JK8K,"""qmlhcb""","[0, 0]","Director John Woo, known for his talent in action films, creates what is probably his worst film with Windtalkers. The idea sounds great: A gifted director of action makes a war film full of battles. But the result is a mess of war clich&eacute;s and run-of-the-mill action scenes.The film follows a sergeant (Nicolas Cage) in World War II on an assignment to protect a Navajo-code talker in the midst of taking control of a Japanese-held Island.  But unfortunately the potentially interesting story never seems to break out from underneath the action.What most strikes a foul chord, though, are the terrible, corny war clich&eacute;s. One soldier hands his wedding band to a friend with instructions to return it to his wife if he dies. The next scene he dies. A hardened soldier who doesn't seem to care about anyone helps a poor Japanese child when he thinks no one is looking. Another racist soldier finds out his ways are wrong. Not one scene in Windtalkers is original, they're just cringe worthy. It's all been done much better before.Of course, intellectual drama isn't Woo's strong point, his action is. So this war film must have great battle action scenes right? Wrong, wrong, wrong. They are boring, tired retreads of better action scenes from other war films. What was Woo doing here? Did he really direct this film?There were a few glimmers of hope during some scenes, but they didn't last long enough to ever make this film enjoyable. The masses may see this film and think it was decent, then quickly forget about it because it really wasn't.

Shocked that it was coming out so soon, excited because I missed it in the theaters.  So gladfully I pre-ordered the DVD early on.  I rccently received it and I gave it a spin.  I do have a surround sound system, but it's out of commission getting my sub-woofers replaced, so therefore I was left watching it without full sound effects.  But nevertheless, after several of the battle scenes, (and there were many), I felt like I was watching a conglomeration of about every Pacific Theater John Wayne movie ever made with today's production values and special effects of course.Now then, I asked myself, is that bad? or is it good for a change?  Especially coming off of films like SPR, Thin Red Line, and Band of Brothers, I feel a change would be welcome.  The film is refreshing in one way, while extremely hoaky in another.  It was refreshing in that for once our senses were treated to a more light-hearted war movie that didn't have all the emotional baggage with it like Thin Red Line did.  On the otherhand, it was hoaky because the battle scenes just seemed so surreal due to that it appeared that no one bullet was fired that MISSED its target.  I mean, when our heroes had run out of rifle or SMG ammo, they resorted to pistols.  In on scene near the end, Cage pops off several rounds of his pistol and every bullet hits and kills a Japanese soldier at probably maximum range of the pistol.  And if that was unbelievable, every round from a rifle or SMG seemd to hit their mark.  I mean when you turn around and spray a hill with Thompson SMG fire and you kill the half dozen soldeirs running down that hill, something tells me that really couldn't happen that way.But with that bit of hoakiness set aside, the battle scenes, of which there were many, were quite entertaining to watch and I assume to listen to as well.  Lots of explosions from Japanese artillery and Hellcats dropping bombs.  I noticed some of the sets used looked very similar to sets used in older Pacific Theater movies, which gave me the idea of the John Wayne connection.But anyway, I give the film 3-stars.  An average rating.  Not the best, but surely not the worst either.  It's fun to watch, you just gotta put aside any WWII knowledge you might have and enjoy yourself.

584239,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005JK8K,Reviewer,"[2, 3]","There is great beauty to be found in life, as well as great ugliness; and often it is where you look and how deeply you feel that will, in the end, determine your perception and either open your eyes to it or cause you to miss it completely.  In this film, director John Woo manages to find beauty amid the ugliness and brutality of war, and it is that vision of the beauty of a greater good, inherent in the indomitable spirit of mankind, that he seeks to offer for the consideration and contemplation of his audience with ""Windtalkers,"" a film that transcends the violence it depicts to discern that omnipresent aspect of the human condition that is defined by the gentleness and compassion of which it's very core has been forged.  More than a film, this is a journey, the intent of which is to open the eyes and the mind; and to those with the courage to assent to it, the heart, as well.  It's a brutal film.  And it's a beautiful film.  And in the end, it will be whichever you deem it to be; it all depends on how deep you want to look.  Or how deeply you want to feel.Saipan, 1944; the U.S. military has implemented a code based on the Navaho language that is virtually unbreakable, and it is imperative that it remain so during their drive to secure this island, which is an important stepping stone on the way to the final objective:  Japan.  The Japanese, meanwhile, would like nothing better than to capture one of the ""codetalkers,"" from whom they could extract the information vital to their efforts against the American forces.  It is therefore vitally important that none of the codetalkers, all of whom are Navaho-- and all Marines-- falls into enemy hands.  Toward that end, a personal ""bodyguard"" has been assigned to each individual codetalker; the charge given to Sergeant Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage) is Private Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), a personable young Navaho with a wife and young son back home.  Yahzee has volunteered because he wants to help his country.  But that information, as well as anything about Yahzee, Enders does not want to hear about or know.  And the reason is very simple:  his mission is to protect the code, not the man; and under no circumstances is Enders to allow Yahzee to be taken alive by the enemy.  So if the moment of truth ever arrives, the less Enders knows about his charge, the easier his job will be.  He's a good Marine, and he has demonstrated in an earlier conflict that he will do his duty, no matter what.  It's the reason he was chosen for this assignment.  So as they venture forth into the fray, the objective is clear in Enders' mind:  At any cost, protect the code.John Woo is the absolute Master of the action genre, and with this film he once again demonstrates what sets him apart from others who may aspire to that which Woo has achieved in film after film.  Quite simply, he refuses to sacrifice story for pure action.  Instead, Woo goes to great lengths, as he has here, to deliver a solid, emotionally involving story, presented through some of the greatest action sequences ever filmed.  The battle scenes he stages are, without question, the predominate force in this film, and they are graphic, but not gory; and just as Spielberg did with ""Saving Private Ryan,"" Woo very straightforwardly addresses the very real brutality of war without resorting to sensationalism or manipulation to engender shock value.  Even in the heat of battle, Woo's focus is not on blood and guts, but on the drama being played out in the lives of Enders and Yahzee, as well as the others we have come to know and care about, like ""Ox"" Henderson (Christian Slater), and his charge, Private Charlie Whitehorse (Roger Willie).Wonderfully staged and beautifully filmed by cinematographer Jeffrey L. Kimball, Woo's film is visually stunning and emotionally engrossing, and succeeds where others of the genre have failed:  ""The Thin Red Line"" had the visual poetry, but lacked the human element; ""Black Hawk Down"" was brutally honest but did not engage emotionally.  Woo succeeds on both fronts with this film, which is not so much an historical depiction of the ""code"" and how it was used, as it is an examination of the moral challenges posed by war and the courage it takes to confront them, presented by Woo primarily through the characters of Enders and Yahzee, and with a sensitivity and some insights into the human condition that is generally lacking in most ""action"" films.As Enders, Nicolas Cage turns in a solid, honest performance in a role which, some years ago, would have seemed custom-made for Steve McQueen.  In Enders, in fact, there is more than a touch of McQueen's Jake Holman from ""The Sand Pebbles.""  With an introspective approach, Cage very quickly and convincingly conveys so much about who Enders is and what makes him tick.  And allowing Cage those ""moments"" in which he so capably develops his character, and putting the drama of the story on an even keel with the action, is a big part of Woo's formula for success.  Cage, as well, refuses to allow the action to take precedent over his character and the story, and he deserves to be commended for it, as the film is better because of it.  Cage and Woo are a good team, in fact; they complement one another artistically, and their collaborative efforts here definitely take this film to a higher level (which was also the case with Woo and Tom Cruise with ""Mission Impossible 2"").The supporting cast includes Mark Ruffalo (Pappas), Peter Stormare (Gunny), Noah Emmerich (Chick) and Frances O'Connor (Rita).  From the ethereal opening frames to the end, supported throughout by a hauntingly wistful score by James Horner, ""Windtalkers"" is another triumph for John Woo, and his best ""American"" film yet.",5,"Anothe Success for the ""Action Master,"" John Woo",1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,5730,"['great', 'beauty', 'be', 'found', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'ugliness', 'often', 'where', 'look',

As seems increasingly common in Hollywood these days, an incredible cast is put together, handed a script that resembles roast beef hash, and the whole ensemble attempts to make something of it.By far the best thing to be said about Windtalkers is the two Navajo code-talkers themselves, played by Adam Beach (the title character from Squanto: A Warrior's Tale a few years ago) and newcomer Roger Willie. The two of them are paired with, respectively, an angry young man (Nicolas Cage) who gets the job because he's good at following orders, though he's conflicted about it, and a happy-go-lucky type nicknamed Ox (Christian Slater). There are so many attempts to show bonding between these four individuals in various ways, and every single one of them falls short. They are clich&eacute;d, shallow, and do nothing other than tell us that the characters are in the same war. Because that falls flat, the rest of the movie has to as well.

584248,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JK8K,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","There's been such a surfeit of war pictures coming out of Hollywood in the past few years that it's small wonder ""Windtalkers"" failed to ignite many box office sparks when it was released in the summer of 2002.  Famed action director John Woo has served himself well by mounting spectacularly effective and brilliantly orchestrated battle scenes, but the writers, John Rice and Joe Bateer, have let him down big time in the story department.  Woo has flooded the screen with moments of uncompromising graphic realism, only to have them mitigated by trite dialogue, predictable ironies and corny melodramatics.  Both the director and the men who actually lived through the events of this true-life story deserve better.""Windtalkers"" does have history going for it.  In World War II, the Allied Forces in the Pacific needed to come up with a brand new code that would be ""uncrackable"" by the Japanese.  The military decided that it would base that code on the Navajo language, thus precipitating the need to recruit young Navajo men to come to the battlefields as ""code-talkers.""  The film focuses on one such man, Ben Yahzee, and the officer, Joe Enders, whose sole duty it becomes to protect Ben in battle and keep him out of the hands of the Japanese.  Joe, naturally, balks at the idea of having to perform ""babysitting"" duty on the front line, and he is not afraid to show Ben just how he feels about the situation in the early stages of their relationship.  Joe has other problems as well.  Recently injured in battle himself, he also struggles with the guilt accrued from having led all the men of his previous platoon to their deaths while ""following orders like a good Marine.""There is certainly plenty in terms of character and conflict for the screenwriters to work with here, yet somehow they never find a way to bring those characters or conflicts to convincing life.  Joe's initial reluctance to accept Ben is as predictable as his inevitable change of heart at the end.  And ""predictable"" is really the key word here in describing much of this film.  Are we really surprised when the most vocal racist in the group - who says ""Injuns"" aren't much different from the Japanese they're all fighting - has his life saved by the very man who's been the target of all his ridicule?  And don't we just know that a soldier will be gunned down the moment he offers a piece of chocolate to a distraught little Japanese girl?  Or how about the fact that the two men, one white, one Navajo, who have been literally making beautiful music together - one on the flute and the other on the harmonica - demonstrating colorblind brotherhood in action, are cut down right next to one another in the same battle?  Thus, the unsettling, cluttered ""messiness"" of the battle scenes is undercut by the too carefully contrived nature of so much of the actual narrative.  By trying so hard to move and uplift us, the film feels manipulative and calculated when it needs to feel most sincere.""Windtalkers"" might have been a more compelling film were it not for the lackluster, wooden performance Nicholas Cage delivers in the lead role.  Cage has never been very adept at conveying complex emotions and his inability to provide any depth or shading to the psychologically tormented Enders goes a long way towards minimalizing the film's impact.  Adam Beach, on the other hand, brings a fresh-faced likability to the part of Ben, the Navajo, who, in many ways, takes on the Private Ryan role in the story.For all the amazing battle scenes in the film, ""Windtalkers"" may just be one war film too many for us to cope with.",2,"great battle scenes, weak script",1059782400,"08 2, 2003",2003,3606,"['been', 'such', 'surfeit', 'war', 'pictures', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'small', 'wonder', 'Windtalkers', 'failed', 'ignite', 'many', 'box', 'office', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'summer', '2002', 'Famed', 'action', 'director', 'John', 'Woo', 'served', 'well', 'mounting', 'spectacularly', 'effective', 'brilliantly', 'orchestrated', 'battle', 'scenes', 'writers', 'John', 'Rice', 'Joe', 'Bateer', 'have', 'let', 'down', 'big', 'time', 'story', 'department', 'Woo', 'flooded', 'screen', 'moments', 'uncompromising', 'graphic', 'realism', 'only', 'have', 'mitigated', 'trite', 'dialogue', 'predictable', 'ironies', 'corny', 'melodramatics', 'director', 'men', 'who', 'actually', 'lived', 'events', 'true-life', 'story', 'deserve', 'better', 'Windtalkers', 'have', 'history', 'going', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Allied', 'Forces', 'Pacific', 'needed', 'come', 'up', 'brand', 'new', 'code', 'would', 'be', 'uncrackable', 'Japanese', 'military', 'decided', 'would', 'base', 'code', 'Navajo', 'language', 'thus', 'precipitating', 'need', 'recruit', 'young', 'Navajo', 'men', 'come', 'battlefields', 'code-talkers', 'film', 'one', 'such', 'man', 'Ben', 'Yahzee', 'officer', 'Joe', 'Enders', 'sole', 'duty', 'protect', 'Ben', 'battle', 'keep', 'hands', 'Japanese', 'Joe', 'naturally', 'balks', 'idea', 'having', 'perform', 'babysitting', 'duty', 'front', 'line', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'Ben', 'just', 'how', 'situation', 'early', 'stages', 'relationship', 'Joe', 'other', 'problems', 'well', 'Recently', 'injured', 'battle', 'also', 'guilt', 'accrued', 'having', 'led', 'men', 'previous', 'platoon', 'deaths', 'following', 'orders', 'good', 'Marine', 'certainly', 'plenty', 'terms', 'character', 'conflict', 'screenwriters', 'work', 'here', 'yet', 'somehow', 'never', 'find', 'way', 'bring', 'characters', 'conflicts', 'convincing', 'life', 'Joe', 'initial', 'reluctance', 'accept', 'Ben', 'as', 'predictable', 'inevitable', 'change', 'heart', 'end', 'predictable', 'really', 'key', 'word', 'here', 'describing', 'much', 'film', 'Are', 'really', 'surprised', 'when', 'most', 'vocal', 'racist', 'group', 'who', 'Injuns', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'different', 'Japanese', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'life', 'saved', 'very', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'target', 'ridicule', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'know', 'soldier', 'will', 'be', 'gunned', 'down', 'moment', 'piece', 'chocolate', 'distraught', 'little', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'how', 'fact', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'white', 'one', 'Navajo', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'literally', 'making', 'beautiful', 'music', 'together', 'one', 'flute', 'other', 'harmonica', 'demonstrating', 'colorblind', 'brotherhood', 'action', 'are', 'cut', 'down', 'right', 'next', 'one', 'same', 'battle', 'Thus', 'unsettling', 'cluttered', 'messiness', 'battle', 'scenes', 'undercut', 'too', 'carefully', 'contrived', 'nature', 'so', 'much', 'actual', 'narrative', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'move', 'uplift', 'film', 'feels', 'manipulative', 'calculated', 'when', 'feel', 'most', 'sincere', 'Windtalkers', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'compelling', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'lackluster', 'wooden', 'performance', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'delivers', 'lead', 'role', 'Cage', 'never', 'been', 'very', 'adept', 'conveying', 'complex', 'emotions', 'inability', 'provide', 'depth', 'shading', 'psychologically', 'tormented', 'Enders', 'long', 'way', 'minimalizing', 'film', 'impact', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'other', 'hand', 'fresh-faced', 'likability', 'part', 'Ben', 'Navajo', 'who', 'many', 'ways', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'role', 'story.For', 'amazing', 'battle', 'scenes', 'film', 'Windtalkers', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'war', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'cope']",N/A

But this summer, when I saw Windtalkers I had already been through 'Behind Enemy Lines','Black Hawk Down' and 'We Were Soldiers'.Did I really want to see ANOTHER war movie?Of course, if it was directed by John Woo who proved his great action flair with the action hits Face/Off and Mission Impossible 2. So I went to see this as any John Woo fan would, and suffice it to say, I was quite dissapointed. I could hardly tell that 'Windtalkers' was directed by Woo, except for one quick scene that featured two soldiers face to face with their guns out and pointed to each other, ala Face/Off's famous Travolta/Cage scene.But I mean really, you don't see any of the director's trademark doves, and believe me, even in a battlefield he could have found a way to work them into the movie. The story itself is a flimsy little adaption of something that occurred during World War 2 involving Navajo Indians who were code talkers, but I'm sure you've heard all about that. Nicholas Cage portrays Joe Enders,an american soldier who has a problem with his hearing and after seeing one too many battles is emotionaly fried.This gives Cage the chance to play his usual character as of late,that of a hopeless man who thanks to someone, in this case his codetalker (Adam Beach), discovers what life is again.The acting is sub-par with the best work coming from Adam Beach, but that isn't saying a whole lot. After a while in the movie each explosion, each death or gory image, became less and less startling, until eventually you'd expect a bomb blast and limbs flying and it just doesn't mean that much anymore.The ending itself is predictable since you know from the commercial how it's going to end and who is going to ultimately die protecting his codetalker.After considering the hell that these guys went through I can't help but feel that they deserve a much better movie, but hollywood, please, no more war movies for at least a year or so.Or they will all just become repeative, and who would that be good for?",3,War What Is It Good For,1035676800,"10 27, 2002",2002,2149,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'release.That', 'back', 'last', 'year', 'right', 'was', 'postponed', 'eight', 'months', 'reason', 'summer', 'when', 'saw', 'Windtalkers', 'had', 'already', 'been', ""'Behind"", 'Enemy', 'Lines', 'Hawk', 'Down', ""'We"", 'Were', ""Soldiers'.Did"", 'really', 'want', 'see', 'ANOTHER', 'war', 'movie', 'course', 'was', 'directed', 'John', 'Woo', 'who', 'proved', 'great', 'action', 'flair', 'action', 'Face/Off', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'So', 'went', 'see', 'John', 'Woo', 'fan', 'would', 'suffice', 'say', 'was', 'quite', 'dissapointed', 'could', 'hardly', 'tell', ""'Windtalkers"", 'was', 'directed', 'Woo', 'one', 'quick', 'scene', 'featured', 'two', 'soldiers', 'face', 'face', 'guns', 'out', 'pointed', 'other', 'ala', 'Face/Off', 'famous', 'Travolta/Cage', 'scene.But', 'mean', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'director', 'trademark', 'doves', 'believe', 'even', 'battlefield', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'work', 'movie', 'story', 'flimsy', 'little', 'adaption', 'something', 'occurred', 'World', 'War', '2', 'involving', 'Navajo', 'Indians', 'who', 'were', 'code', 'talkers', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Joe', 'Enders', 'american', 'soldier', 'who', 'problem', 'hearing', 'seeing', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'battles', 'emotionaly', 'fried.This', 'Cage', 'chance', 'play', 'usual', 'character', 'late', 'hopeless', 'man', 'who', 'someone', 'case', 'codetalker', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'what', 'life', 'again.The', 'acting', 'sub-par', 'best', 'work', 'coming', 'Adam', 'Beach', ""n't"", 'saying', 'whole', 'lot', 'while', 'movie', 'explosion', 'death', 'gory', 'image', 'became', 'less', 'less', 'startling', 'eventually', ""'d"", 'expect', 'bomb', 'blast', 'limbs', 'flying', 'just', ""n't"", 'mean', 'much', 'anymore.The', 'ending', 'predictable', 'know', 'commercial', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'who', 'going', 'ultimately', 'die', 'protecting', 'codetalker.After', 'considering', 'hell', 'guys', 'went', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'deserve', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'hollywood', 'please', 'more', 'war', 'movies', 'least', 'year', 'so.Or', 'will', 'just', 'become', 'repeative', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'good']",N/A

This film does niether. The battle scenes for the south pacific are very inaccurate as are these mish mashed uniforms. Realism went out the window.Next we have the story of the Navajo code talkers which get very little play. Instead the main story revolves around the tormented Sgt.played (very well) by Nic Cage. It is an intresting character but Woo doesnt give even Cage the proper time and set-ups.I cant help but wonder whats gone on with John Woo since coming to America. He has not matched the outstanding work he did in HongKong , let alone surpassed it. FaceOff is as close as he has come to his previous films.

I knew two of the real code talkers as old men and had gotten some factual background.What a disappointment! This movie was bad on so many points, it's hard to know where to start. My main gripe is that it seemed more about Nicolas Cage personally, ""the great and versatile actor,"" than about the Navajo code talkers in WW2. The scenes seemed to be specially contrived more to exhibit Cage's acting skills than to tell a believable and riveting story about the code talkers.The editing was disjointed and the battle scenes were actually comical in places because they went against what every combat soldier knows is believable behavior in combat if you don't want to get killed. The scenes were overly dramatic with fake blood spattering, obviously for audience impact. Stunt men were constantly being blown into the air, overly dramatic fiery explosions nearby, bunched-up marines calmly exposing themselves to ambush fire, etc.  The military advisors, if there were any, were completely ignored for the sake of unrealistically excessive special effects.I could go on and on but will summarize by saying that this was nowhere near the cinematic achievement of Saving Private Ryan, Lost Battalion, or Band of Brothers. I can't comment on the ending because Windtalkers stunk so bad I was confused and lost interest about two thirds through and switched channels to a much better crafted old black and white detective movie on TCM.Windtalker was really bad, unless maybe if you're a ten year old with a couple of school friends, plenty of popcorn, and nothing else to do on a Saturday afternoon.

And that's not hyperbole.I don't count ""The Wicker Man"" re-make, which was great for all the wrong reasons, and I suppose given that I generally have to be drunk or desperate to be willing to watch Cage at all, I haven't seen everything he has done . . . but the best people can hope for is that Cage just stay out of way of the stunts and the set pieces, as in the ""National Treasure"" movies.So, why should ""Windtalkers"" be any different?After all, this is a beautifully shot but intellectually vapid take on World War Two.  Notice that I didn't say on the contributions of Navajo to the victories in World War Two, victories -- and this is not hyperbole -- that would have been unlikely without their contribution.  The irony of people the government once tried to exterminate and discrimate(d) openly against nonetheless expecting them to do their ""patriotic duty"" when it benefited the very same government is lost in a movie that instead focuses mostly on Cage brooding or being pursued by a decidedly non-Navajo nurse.  Nor is there understanding of the irony that the Navajo -- presented here with reasonable dignity but not depth -- will be led not by one of their own but by a former high school deliquent and screw-up suffering from PTSD. (A telling example is where Cage's character decides to blow up one of the Windtalkers rather than let him be taken prisoner . . . an action that becomes  pointless when the battle is soon over and with victory for the Americans; this is after he receives a medal for valor, of course.)  My dad was in the Army, and this smacks of the kind of thinking that made him decide to not make it his career.What we get instead is John Woo's obsession with acrobatics and slow-motion shots that often border on parody in a movie recounting historical events.  James Horner's mostly overplayed score -- except for the ""Saving private Ryan""-esque overture and the occasional haunting ""flutes"" -- doesn't help.  It's like watching kids playing war with a lot more money and their own soundtrack.  I already blame Woo for ""inspiring"" hacks like Michael Bay, but his inability to understand restraint with action turns a film that could, despite Cage, have been a dramatic winner. A few scenes, such as when Roger Willie and Christian Slater in character play music together over a montage actually work.  The script by John Rice and Joe Batteer, however, seems at moments to want to tell a different story than Woo does.The rest of the cast deserves to be in a better movie, especially Adam Beach, who has the quiet presence of Audie Murphy or Neville Brand, real deal heroes.  He should have been the focus of this film and not Cage.  Even Slater, who turns in good performances, gets slighted.  But with so little on the actual contributions of the Navajo, the film follows the standard course of making what should be supporting characters the stars and vice versa.That's yet another indignity the Windtalkers must face.",3,Like Lawrence of Arabia  with a Lobotomy and Slow Motion Viiolence,1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,3024,"['Nicolas', 'Cage', ""n't"", 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'Raising', 'Arizona', 'not', 'hyperbole.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'Wicker', 'Man', 're-make', 'was', 'great', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'suppose', 'given', 'generally', 'have', 'be', 'drunk', 'desperate', 'be', 'willing', 'watch', 'Cage', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'everything', 'done', 'best', 'people', 'can', 'hope', 'Cage', 'just', 'stay', 'way', 'stunts', 'set', 'pieces', 'National', 'Treasure', 'movies.So', 'why', 'should', 'Windtalkers', 'be', 'different', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'intellectually', 'vapid', 'take', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'contributions', 'Navajo', 'victories', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'victories', 'not', 'hyperbole', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unlikely', 'contribution', 'irony', 'people', 'government', 'once', 'tried', 'exterminate', 'discrimate', 'd', 'openly', 'nonetheless', 'expecting', 'do', 'patriotic', 'duty', 'when', 'benefited', 'very', 'same', 'government', 'lost', 'movie', 'instead', 'mostly', 'Cage', 'brooding', 'being', 'pursued', 'decidedly', 'non-Navajo', 'nurse', 'there', 'understanding', 'irony', 'Navajo', 'presented', 'here', 'reasonable', 'dignity', 'not', 'depth', 'will', 'be', 'led', 'not', 'one', 'own', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'deliquent', 'screw-up', 'suffering', 'PTSD', 'telling', 'example', 'where', 'Cage', 'character', 'blow', 'up', 'one', 'Windtalkers', 'rather', 'let', 'be', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'action', 'pointless', 'when', 'battle', 'soon', 'victory', 'Americans', 'medal', 'valor', 'course', 'dad', 'was', 'Army', 'smacks', 'kind', 'thinking', 'made', 'decide', 'not', 'make', 'career.What', 'get', 'instead', 'John', 'Woo', 'obsession', 'acrobatics', 'slow-motion', 'shots', 'often', 'border', 'parody', 'movie', 'recounting', 'historical', 'events', 'James', 'Horner', 'mostly', 'overplayed', 'score', 'Saving', 'private', 'Ryan', '-esque', 'overture', 'occasional', 'haunting', 'flutes', ""n't"", 'help', 'watching', 'kids', 'playing', 'war', 'lot', 'more', 'money', 'own', 'soundtrack', 'already', 'blame', 'Woo', 'inspiring', 'hacks', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'inability', 'understand', 'restraint', 'action', 'film', 'could', 'Cage', 'have', 'been', 'dramatic', 'winner', 'few', 'scenes', 'such', 'when', 'Roger', 'Willie', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'character', 'play', 'music', 'together', 'montage', 'actually', 'work', 'script', 'John', 'Rice', 'Joe', 'Batteer', 'however', 'moments', 'want', 'tell', 'different', 'story', 'Woo', 'does.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'be', 'better', 'movie', 'especially', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'who', 'quiet', 'presence', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'Neville', 'Brand', 'real', 'deal', 'heroes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'focus', 'film', 'not', 'Cage', 'Even', 'Slater', 'who', 'good', 'performances', 'slighted', 'so', 'little', 'actual', 'contributions', 'Navajo', 'film', 'standard', 'course', 'making', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'supporting', 'characters', 'stars', 'vice', 'versa.That', 'yet', 'indignity', 'Windtalkers', 'must', 'face']",N/A

Hey, there's no problem really of treating even a WWII massacre like that in the Japanese islands like his Mission Impossible flick. Is there?There's also no problem with having Nicholas Cage act like Rambo either, no? Besides, if Cage himself doesnt mind playing in embarrasing films like that it's not Woo's fault, right?But mr.Woo thinks that as long as he shows us loadsa gore, heads flying off, arms being shot to bits and the all the rest of it, he's gonna get the audiences flocking da theaters. Think again mr.Woo.The digital planes bombing the bejeesus off the ""Japs"" are so obvious they reminded me the glory days of the Japanese version of the cardboard Godzilla. As did the fake explosions, in fact I've seen explosions in playstation games looking more realistic than those in the film.The worst part? Forget the fact that dialogues are an insult to the very word ""dialogue"". Forget the fact that the characters themselves are pathetic caricatures seen only in D-movie disasters. Forget the fact that as history itself is concerned this film is as distanced from it as it could possibly be. But, man, couldn't mr.Woo at least have picked another instance from WWII history , one that at least did NOT involve the Navajo indians?????? Why insult them like that by putting lines in the Navajo character's mouth like: ""I want to go to war to fight for my country""???? Uhm, werent the Navajos practically expterminated OFF their own country by those very people they supposedly would love to ""fight for"" in the film?Mere details some will say. Of course.

We have the ""hold on to this ring and give it to my wife in case I'm killed"" speech, the wide-eyed soldier's flashbacks to a gory battle, the ""I can't take this anymore"" harangue by a soldier to his commander, the American-soldier-gives-chocolate-to-a-young-child-of-the-enemy scene, the racist soldier who has his life saved by the minority character and then becomes enlightened, and so on.  On top of that, some of the action is so ludicrous that it could just as well have come from a Rambo film.Why then does this film get four stars?  Well, damned if it doesn't bring a tear to your eye and a lump in your throat at the end.  This is because for all the absurdity and melodrama in the movie, there is a real chemistry between Nicholas Cage and the likeable Adam Beach.  When one of the character dies, you know you're being manipulated to blubber, but it works.From the title and previews you might expect that the Navajo cryptographers are at the center of this story, but that is just a gimmick.  Yes, Adam Beach gets plenty of screen time, but generally speaking he is used less to illuminate the story of the ""windtalkers"" than to be a sunny foil against Cage's dark humors and to provide Woo opportunities to make some fairly banal if well-intentioned observations about racism.  I for one left the theater wishing that the story of the windtalkers had been more integral to the plot.The action sequences are well done, but Woo plows no new ground after the breakthroughs in staging battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan and in Blackhawk Down.

584275,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JK8K,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 10]","Where is John Woo?  While I was watching ""Windtalker,"" I was wondering if someone else was actually sitting in a director's chair, and Woo just lent his name.  At best, this is just another war movie that we saw in the 50s or 60s, with Aldrich or Fuller as director, and they made a better one.The original idea is laudable one, which is about ""Navajo Code Talkers.""  During the WW2, the US army invented a new code system based on Navajo language, and they recruited Navajo soldiers as cord talkers.  But in case of their being captured and tortured by the Japanese army, the headquarters ordered another soldier to always accompany them, to protect the code from the enemy -- no matter how.Thus Nick Cage, after surviving a battle that killed his men all, comes back to the war, with cordtalker Adam Beach.  As you expect from this situation, they initially don't understand each other, but gradually come to share camaranderie.  But that  means much trouble in carrying out the mission for Cage in case of emergency.The premise is good, and Woo is always fascinated with describing the friendship between men.  So far, good.  However, once those battle scenes start, we know that part of friendship is missing from the result.  At first, the battle sequence is magnificient.  The scale is grand, the extra probably exceed one thousand, and cross-fire battle is real.  But the script is just repetitive, leading us nowhere.  The worst thing is somehow the director chose to express the gradual development of their emotions through talks, where Woo's cinematic strength never lies.  Yes, sometimes, the film is talk, talk, and talk.  And you see cardboard characters such as a white soldier, who, constantly looking down on Navajo soldiers, suddenly starts to humiliate one of them.  But soon, he regrets it because he is saved by ... why, that Navajo soldier.  Too easy.But the most disappointing thing about the film is that it never displays the significance of the code talkers on the battlefield that they should deserve.  In many of the battle scenes, how and why certain code system is so crutial to the war is never fully explained, undermining the potential of the original idea.  This underdevelopment of the intriguing true story about Navajo code talkers, perhaps, comes from the weakness of the script, which often looks ridiculous even to non-experts of war like me.  At one scece, to obtain a radio equipment from the Japanese army, Nicholas Cage pretends he is captured by Adam Beach, who also pretends that he is a Japanese soldier.  I, being a Japanese, can say that it is highly improbable that this kind of ruse would succeed, especially when Beach only knows and repeats one Japanese phrase, ""Horyo-da"" (roughly meaning in Japanese ""He's POW."") in front of the excited Japanese soldiers who are shouting him -- ""Doko-no Butai-da?"" -- asking what unit of the army he belongs to.Probably this material of Navajo code talkers is best treated as a documentary film.  Among this historical settings, John Woo, who shows his best skills in most outrageous situations -- see ""Face/Off"" for instance -- has no place to flourish his usual styles, which made his name of today.

It was NOT meant for the art house people that would rather sit through some French romance film. This is meant to excite, and cash in on the wave of post 9-11 war films.

The direction was predictable and the action scenes could have been shot by a five year old boy playing &quot;war hero&quot; in the backyard, alot of noise and piles of dust and actors pretending to be dead. All this with the constant drone of a musical score best left for a karoke bar to hum along to.And what happened to Nicolas Cage? He used to be a great actor with individual style and presentation.
