872187,AZR2AL8T2R3BN,B0006Q93YM,Amory Ross,"[1, 1]","I purchased this movie for review and consideration to show my ninth grade class. We read this as per the curriculum, and I was glad to see a motion picture which could potentially accommodate it. The movie lack several important aspects of the book. It also takes a very liberal script stand-point. The actors themselves (as well as the scenery) just don't seem to pull the audience in. This movie, I would say, completely missed the point.This movie seems to have fallen into the pool of books-to-movies that completely lose sight of the book's purpose. Where Lord of the Flies film adaptation left the audience feeling deflated for its blatant disregard for the classic, so too did this movie. In what could have been potentially a decent movie, the screenplays and writers seemed to strike out with scene after scene of forced dialogue and awkward interactions. The relationship between Phineas and Gene could best be described as acquaintences at best. The on-again-off-again relationship on-screen doesn't seem to capture the inner struggle Gene had in the book. Finny seemed more fake than peaceful. Gene seemed lacking self-esteem instead of being the brightest student at Devon.Brinker seemed to be the only scripted person who did a rather decent job of his role. Even he couldn't escape the wrath of awful writing as he converses with Gene at the end of the story as if suddenly everything would turn out alright.The writers took liberty to add what seemed like useless scenes. Case in point: the apple-picking scene. For those that have read the book, the apple-picking scene could have been viewed as a replacement for the snow-shoveling scene. Written into the script was a man who bequeaths what we're told is his combat deceased son's military dress hat. The man's reaction to the loss of his son doesn't exactly match up with his eagerness to depart with what he says was the last item he had of his son.Also a half-hearted attempt at capturing the book's tone was the scene involving the Devon Winter Olympics (not Winter Carnival, mind you). This ho-hum single event creates an urge to fast-forward to the next scene in hopes of finding something worth viewing.Leper's character doesn't follow the script either. Instead of Leper going crazy in Vermont, he secludes himself in a hut in the woods just off campus. Because of this alteration we obviously don't see the quick confrontation/ dinner with Gene, Leper, and Leper's mother.  Ultimately in the end, it is Leper who says he was at Finny's incident, yet one can think back to the actual footage of the fall and not see Leper's presence at all.The actors, plus the location, just don't do the trick. Finny seems to be apathetic to anything. He doesn't have 'hockey team-size groups of people' following him around campus in the movie. He also doesn't seem to be the center of attention on campus like the book indicates. He seems like an everyday student who smiles at people a lot. Gene seems like a ticking time bomb for reasons outside of the script that are hinted around his southern upbringing (apparently he's from the south in the movie). And while the book takes place at what could be considered Exeter, the campus onscreen does not resemble the description by Knowles. As a matter of fact, it's missing a river, much less the two rivers described in the book. Without rivers, Cliff Quackenbush has no room in the script.The ultimate foul I think, though, is the complete disregard for important dialogue. Basic exchanges between Gene and faculty are completely eliminated. However, it is the revealing conversation between Gene and Phineas in the hospital that could have salvaged the movie. The audience never gets to see Gene tell Finny that he would be awful in war, allowing the audience to realize he was the sole beacon of peace during World War II at Devon. That conversation could have let viewers in on Finny's personality, but unfortunately it does not happen.I am not sure if I will show this to my class. Yet again brief instances of foul language sends an otherwise movie to rated R. I think students will find the movie lacking, complete with a sense of confusion as to what was missing in it. It could be worth a try so long as the educator prefaces the movie with a missive stating the movie is not a study aid. Otherwise I would skip it completely.",2,Misses the book's tone.,1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,4350,"['purchased', 'movie', 'review', 'consideration', 'show', 'ninth', 'grade', 'class', 'read', 'curriculum', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'motion', 'picture', 'could', 'potentially', 'accommodate', 'movie', 'lack', 'several', 'important', 'aspects', 'book', 'also', 'very', 'liberal', 'script', 'stand-point', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'scenery', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'pull', 'audience', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'completely', 'missed', 'point.This', 'movie', 'have', 'fallen', 'pool', 'books-to-movies', 'completely', 'lose', 'sight', 'book', 'purpose', 'Where', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'film', 'adaptation', 'left', 'audience', 'feeling', 'deflated', 'blatant', 'disregard', 'classic', 'so', 'too', 'did', 'movie', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'potentially', 'decent', 'movie', 'screenplays', 'writers', 'seemed', 'strike', 'out', 'scene', 'scene', 'forced', 'dialogue', 'awkward', 'interactions', 'relationship', 'Phineas', 'Gene', 'could', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'acquaintences', 'best', 'on-again-off-again', 'relationship', 'on-screen', ""n't"", 'seem', 'capture', 'inner', 'struggle', 'Gene', 'had', 'book', 'Finny', 'seemed', 'more', 'fake', 'peaceful', 'Gene', 'seemed', 'lacking', 'self-esteem', 'instead', 'being', 'brightest', 'student', 'Devon.Brinker', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'scripted', 'person', 'who', 'did', 'rather', 'decent', 'job', 'role', 'Even', 'could', ""n't"", 'escape', 'wrath', 'awful', 'writing', 'Gene', 'end', 'story', 'suddenly', 'everything', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'alright.The', 'writers', 'took', 'liberty', 'add', 'what', 'seemed', 'like', 'useless', 'scenes', 'Case', 'point', 'apple-picking', 'scene', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'apple-picking', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'viewed', 'replacement', 'snow-shoveling', 'scene', 'Written', 'script', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'what', ""'re"", 'told', 'combat', 'deceased', 'son', 'military', 'dress', 'hat', 'man', 'reaction', 'loss', 'son', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'match', 'up', 'eagerness', 'depart', 'what', 'was', 'last', 'item', 'had', 'son.Also', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'capturing', 'book', 'tone', 'was', 'scene', 'involving', 'Devon', 'Winter', 'Olympics', 'not', 'Winter', 'Carnival', 'ho-hum', 'single', 'event', 'urge', 'fast-forward', 'next', 'scene', 'hopes', 'finding', 'something', 'worth', 'viewing.Leper', 'character', ""n't"", 'follow', 'script', 'either', 'Instead', 'Leper', 'going', 'crazy', 'Vermont', 'hut', 'woods', 'just', 'campus', 'alteration', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'quick', 'confrontation/', 'dinner', 'Gene', 'Leper', 'Leper', 'mother', 'Ultimately', 'end', 'Leper', 'who', 'was', 'Finny', 'incident', 'yet', 'one', 'can', 'think', 'back', 'actual', 'footage', 'fall', 'not', 'see', 'Leper', 'presence', 'all.The', 'actors', 'location', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'trick', 'Finny', 'be', 'apathetic', 'anything', ""n't"", 'have', ""'hockey"", 'team-size', 'groups', 'people', 'following', 'around', 'campus', 'movie', 'also', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'center', 'attention', 'campus', 'book', 'everyday', 'student', 'who', 'people', 'lot', 'Gene', 'ticking', 'time', 'bomb', 'reasons', 'script', 'are', 'hinted', 'southern', 'upbringing', 'apparently', 'south', 'movie', 'book', 'place', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'Exeter', 'campus', 'onscreen', 'not', 'resemble', 'description', 'Knowles', 'matter', 'fact', 'missing', 'river', 'much', 'less', 'two', 'rivers', 'described', 'book', 'rivers', 'Cliff', 'Quackenbush', 'room', 'script.The', 'ultimate', 'foul', 'think', 'though', 'complete', 'disregard', 'important', 'dialogue', 'Basic', 'exchanges', 'Gene', 'faculty', 'are', 'completely', 'eliminated', 'However', 'revealing', 'conversation', 'Gene', 'Phineas', 'hospital', 'could', 'have', 'salvaged', 'movie', 'audience', 'never', 'see', 'Gene', 'tell', 'Finny', 'would', 'be', 'awful', 'war', 'allowing', 'audience', 'realize', 'was', 'sole', 'beacon', 'peace', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Devon', 'conversation', 'could', 'have', 'let', 'viewers', 'Finny', 'personality', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'happen.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'show', 'class', 'again', 'brief', 'instances', 'foul', 'language', 'otherwise', 'movie', 'rated', 'R.', 'think', 'students', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'lacking', 'complete', 'sense', 'confusion', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'could', 'be', 'try', 'so', 'long', 'educator', 'movie', 'missive', 'stating', 'movie', 'not', 'study', 'aid', 'would', 'skip', 'completely']",A Separate Peace
872188,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0006Q93YM,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[12, 15]","When I saw a listing (in a gay film catalogue) for the DVD of ""A Separate Peace"", a 2004 Showtime made-for-cable movie, I recalled reading the book while in high school (apx 40 years ago) and that it did spark some confusing feelings which - now in retrospect - I recognize as my latent homosexuality.  The feeling was reinforced somewhat when I saw the 1972 film version of the film, when it was first released in the theatres, which followed the book closely, though the acting was poor (It was produced mostly with non-actors who were actually students at the New England prep academy where they filmed.  Trivia note: The one ""real"" actor was a teenage Parker Stevenson in his first acting job.)  While the acting and production values are much better in this 2004 update, what was lost is essentially the subtle power of John Knowles original novel, to the point where this really should have been designated as a story ""based on"" the book, rather than represent that it was a cinema rendering of that story.Before we go any further, let's clarify that ""A Separate Peace"" (the book or either movie) is NOT a gay story, per se.  In discussing his (first published in 1959) book, Knowles made it clear he was not suggesting there was any kind of physical relationship between the athletic, outgoing Finney (played in the new film by Toby Moore) and his prep school roommate, the somewhat shy and studious Gene (J Barton).  However, keep in mind that, in the 1960's and 1970's (including the release of the first film), gays were used to ""reading between the lines"" in books and screenplays to get some subtext of possible homosexuality, and there certainly was enough here, in the closeness that developed between the two boys in the book, and visibly suggested in the 1972 film (based on recent comments I read about it).This 2004 version is - at best - a ""male bonding"" / ""coming of age"" story, with some eye candy thrown in (Toby Moore was a competitive swimmer before turning to acting, and Barton is also an attractive young man).  Unfortunately, it deviates a bit more than it should from the original story and, in doing so, compromises not just the spirit of Knowles' book but also diminishes (perhaps intentionally, I don't know) the nuance of possible homosexuality between Finney and Gene.  Relegated to tell a rather detailed story in less than two hours, it also takes some shortcuts (such as voiceovers giving information that readers had to ""discover"" in the book itself, deleting some scenes (and at least one character) from the book, and providing clarity to a climactic scene (the double jump from the tree) that would have been better served if left as vague as it was in the book and first film.  Pure fans of the book are justified in blasting the 2004 film for this.However, this is still a beautifully-made ""coming of age"" film that I think gay men can relate to, perhaps more than the general population, and I can recommend (and rate it ... 3 out of 5 stars) based on that criteria.DVD contains no extras, just scene selection.  [Trivia notes: 1.  Another of the boys (Chad) is played by Aaron Ashmore, who had the lead role in the gay film ""Prom Queen: The Marc Hall Story"".  2.  This was the final role for character actor Hume Cronyn, who passed away at age 92 shortly after completing this film.]",3,"Good story and acting, but fans of the book will be disappointed.",1148688000,"05 27, 2006",2006,3328,"['When', 'saw', 'listing', 'gay', 'film', 'catalogue', 'DVD', 'A', 'Separate', 'Peace', '2004', 'Showtime', 'made-for-cable', 'movie', 'recalled', 'reading', 'book', 'high', 'school', 'apx', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'did', 'spark', 'confusing', 'feelings', 'now', 'retrospect', 'recognize', 'latent', 'homosexuality', 'feeling', 'was', 'reinforced', 'somewhat', 'when', 'saw', '1972', 'film', 'version', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'theatres', 'followed', 'book', 'closely', 'acting', 'was', 'poor', 'was', 'produced', 'mostly', 'non-actors', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'students', 'New', 'England', 'prep', 'academy', 'where', 'filmed', 'Trivia', 'note', 'one', 'real', 'actor', 'was', 'teenage', 'Parker', 'Stevenson', 'first', 'acting', 'job', 'acting', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'much', 'better', '2004', 'update', 'what', 'was', 'lost', 'essentially', 'subtle', 'power', 'John', 'Knowles', 'original', 'novel', 'point', 'where', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'designated', 'story', 'based', 'book', 'rather', 'represent', 'was', 'cinema', 'rendering', 'story.Before', 'go', 'further', 'let', 'clarify', 'A', 'Separate', 'Peace', 'book', 'movie', 'NOT', 'gay', 'story', 'se', 'discussing', 'first', 'published', '1959', 'book', 'Knowles', 'made', 'clear', 'was', 'not', 'suggesting', 'there', 'was', 'kind', 'physical', 'relationship', 'athletic', 'outgoing', 'Finney', 'played', 'new', 'film', 'Toby', 'Moore', 'prep', 'school', 'roommate', 'somewhat', 'shy', 'studious', 'Gene', 'J', 'Barton', 'However', 'keep', 'mind', '1960', '1970', 'including', 'release', 'first', 'film', 'gays', 'were', 'used', 'reading', 'lines', 'books', 'screenplays', 'get', 'subtext', 'possible', 'homosexuality', 'certainly', 'was', 'enough', 'here', 'closeness', 'developed', 'two', 'boys', 'book', 'visibly', 'suggested', '1972', 'film', 'based', 'recent', 'comments', 'read', '2004', 'version', 'best', 'male', 'bonding', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'eye', 'candy', 'thrown', 'Toby', 'Moore', 'was', 'competitive', 'swimmer', 'turning', 'acting', 'Barton', 'also', 'attractive', 'young', 'man', 'Unfortunately', 'bit', 'more', 'should', 'original', 'story', 'doing', 'so', 'not', 'just', 'spirit', 'Knowles', 'book', 'also', 'diminishes', 'perhaps', 'intentionally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'nuance', 'possible', 'homosexuality', 'Finney', 'Gene', 'Relegated', 'tell', 'rather', 'detailed', 'story', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'also', 'shortcuts', 'such', 'voiceovers', 'giving', 'information', 'readers', 'had', 'discover', 'book', 'deleting', 'scenes', 'least', 'one', 'character', 'book', 'providing', 'clarity', 'climactic', 'scene', 'double', 'jump', 'tree', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'left', 'as', 'vague', 'was', 'book', 'first', 'film', 'Pure', 'fans', 'book', 'are', 'justified', 'blasting', '2004', 'film', 'this.However', 'still', 'beautifully-made', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'think', 'gay', 'men', 'can', 'relate', 'perhaps', 'more', 'general', 'population', 'can', 'recommend', 'rate', '3', '5', 'stars', 'based', 'criteria.DVD', 'extras', 'just', 'scene', 'selection', '[', 'Trivia', 'notes', '1', 'boys', 'Chad', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Ashmore', 'who', 'had', 'lead', 'role', 'gay', 'film', 'Prom', 'Queen', 'Marc', 'Hall', 'Story', '2', 'was', 'final', 'role', 'character', 'actor', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'age', '92', 'shortly', 'completing', 'film', ']']",A Separate Peace

872190,A3FEX2RN3Q5XT4,B0006Q93YM,C. Daly,"[16, 18]","First let me say that a movie can never acheive the level of depth as a well-written novel.  Even if this film had a script taken verbatim from the book, it would not be able to convey the same depth of meaning, the same development of characters.That being said, I think this movie is excellent.  Of course, I am in a unique position.  I watched the movie first, and then was so intrigued, I went on to read the book.  Had I fallen in love with the book first, I may very well have found the movie disappointing like many of the other reviewers. But since I saw the movie on its own without comparing it to the book, I was able to see how this movie is an artistic work with its own merits, irrespective of the challenges of bringing a classic novel to the screen.The strongest actor in this film is Toby Moore, who steals almost every scene he's in as Finny.  He radiates charisma, which is perfect for a character who Knowles wrote as being able to ""shine with everyone, he attracted everyone he met.""  He's a character incapable of hating anyone or holding a grudge, and a character who no one can help but like.  I could not have imagined him portrayed any better.Some scenes are added to the movie that are not in the book, but I feel these scenes are useful in developing characters and relationships that are developed through straight description in the book.  We see how the war plays a role in these boys' lives--a distant joke at first, and then one of the boys goes off to the Army and comes back different--disheveled, mentally broken.  We see Gene's changing relationship with Finny, his admiration combined with thinly veiled resentment and jealousy, and finally his realization that Finny meant well all along, that there was never any rivalry, that Finny wanted to see only the good in Gene and was deeply hurt by any other suggestion.The movie's main weakness is that much is missing in the development of Gene's character.  His motivations are vague and his true feelings veiled without the internal narration of the novel.  He's still well-portrayed in the film, but I can better understand Gene after reading the book.If you're looking for an exact representation of John Knowles' novel, then you will be waiting forever.  But this movie is a gem in its own right, a moving and engaging coming-of-age story.",5,Moving and well-made,1111276800,"03 20, 2005",2005,2329,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'movie', 'can', 'never', 'acheive', 'level', 'depth', 'well-written', 'novel', 'Even', 'film', 'had', 'script', 'taken', 'verbatim', 'book', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'convey', 'same', 'depth', 'meaning', 'same', 'development', 'characters.That', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'movie', 'excellent', 'course', 'am', 'unique', 'position', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'then', 'was', 'so', 'intrigued', 'went', 'read', 'book', 'Had', 'fallen', 'love', 'book', 'first', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'found', 'movie', 'disappointing', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'saw', 'movie', 'own', 'comparing', 'book', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'artistic', 'work', 'own', 'merits', 'irrespective', 'challenges', 'bringing', 'classic', 'novel', 'screen.The', 'strongest', 'actor', 'film', 'Toby', 'Moore', 'who', 'almost', 'scene', 'Finny', 'charisma', 'perfect', 'character', 'who', 'wrote', 'being', 'able', 'shine', 'everyone', 'attracted', 'everyone', 'met', 'character', 'incapable', 'hating', 'anyone', 'holding', 'grudge', 'character', 'who', 'one', 'can', 'help', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'imagined', 'portrayed', 'better.Some', 'scenes', 'are', 'added', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'book', 'feel', 'scenes', 'are', 'useful', 'developing', 'characters', 'relationships', 'are', 'developed', 'straight', 'description', 'book', 'see', 'how', 'war', 'role', 'boys', 'lives', 'distant', 'joke', 'first', 'then', 'one', 'boys', 'Army', 'back', 'different', 'disheveled', 'mentally', 'broken', 'see', 'Gene', 'changing', 'relationship', 'Finny', 'admiration', 'combined', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'resentment', 'jealousy', 'finally', 'realization', 'Finny', 'meant', 'well', 'all', 'along', 'was', 'never', 'rivalry', 'Finny', 'wanted', 'see', 'only', 'good', 'Gene', 'was', 'deeply', 'hurt', 'other', 'suggestion.The', 'movie', 'main', 'weakness', 'much', 'missing', 'development', 'Gene', 'character', 'motivations', 'are', 'vague', 'true', 'feelings', 'veiled', 'internal', 'narration', 'novel', 'still', 'well-portrayed', 'film', 'can', 'better', 'understand', 'Gene', 'reading', 'book.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'exact', 'representation', 'John', 'Knowles', 'novel', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'waiting', 'forever', 'movie', 'gem', 'own', 'right', 'moving', 'engaging', 'coming-of-age', 'story']",A Separate Peace
872191,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006Q93YM,Grady Harp,"[8, 11]","A SEPARATE PEACE, based on John Knowles' novel that became a standard in the college student library, is a finely wrought, ultimately transformative story that is well adapted to the screen by Wendy Kesselman.  Given the broad spectrum of the novel's story, the script opts for focusing on the special interplay of four youths attending Dover Boys School in 1943.  Director Peter Yates ('The Dresser', 'Year of the Comet', 'Breaking Away', 'Bullit', etc) understands the special atmosphere of the boys' boarding school and the impact on young American youth living under the threat of World War II and translates that tension and impact well.Gene (J Barton) enters Dover (a school populated by boys from families of wealth and position) from his meager home in the South, determined to achieve on the basis of his abilities in this 'foreign atmosphere'.  He is assigned to roommate Finny (Toby Moore) who is a natural athlete and a lad who lives entirely in the moment, achieving goals in private without the need for applause.  He grows to deeply admire Gene, taking a while to see that Gene's academic accomplishments come through very hard work and not as a 'natural gift' as is the case with the rest of the classmates.  They bond with fellow students Brinker (Jacob Pitts) who is the school's top scholar, and Leper (Danny Schroeder) who manages to interject bizarre humor about Hitler and the current war situation on the European front whenever possible.Finny constantly challenges Gene out of good graces to perform acts of liberation, including jumping from a tree into a pond, a feat reserved for those higher classmates in the school who are preparing ROTC style to volunteer for the war upon graduation.  Finny and Gene become very close while at different ends of the spectrum of self-perception and evaluation.  On a routine revisit to the tree from which they jump, Gene shakes the limb and Finny falls to the ground breaking his leg.  Apparently with a memory loss that prevents him from the truth about his accident, Finney simply recovers, knowing his career as an athlete is over, but not placing blame on anything but accident, a fact that shakes Gene's perception of himself and his guilt.When the war increases tension, Leper volunteers and 'goes off to be a skiing GI', Brinker decides to enlist at the end of term, Finny bemoans the fact that his accident prevents him from staying with his friends, and Gene is ultimately brought to a student trial about the 'accident'.  How each of these young men enter adulthood with the war on their heels and the effects of their loss of innocence forms the ending to the story - an ending that clearly paints the way each of us interacts with those around us and finds our separate peace.The acting by a group of young men whose previous roles have been in forgettable films is uniformly superb.  There is an honesty and clarity drawn by each character (with the able direction of Yates) that makes us identify with these innocent youths.  The musical score is appropriate, the photography captures the beauty of New England, and the feeling at the end of the film is one that creates the desire to return to the Knowles novel to relive the lives of these boys becoming men.

872197,A3VHEN1LDM6EQ,B0006Q93YM,"S. Wilson ""tradersww""","[72, 81]","""A Separate Peace"" is one of my favorite books. An absolutely horrible film version was made of it in 1974, so I knew Showtime's updated version was virtually guaranteed to be an improvement. An improvement it is... but it could - and should - have been better.First the Good: The role of Finny has got to be one of the hardest parts out there to cast. The part calls for natural athleticism and tremendous charisma - a truly rare combination (especially in actors). Toby Moore was great casting. I have no idea who he is or where he came from. He had an almost impossible task, and he nailed it. The actors who played Gene and Brinker also performed admirably. If it had a script that stuck to the actual Knowles' story, this film might have been something very special.Now to the Bad: Knowles' story is much more than a story about adolescent friendship and betrayal. It is about how a person can only find peace within himself when he is forced to face his own darkness. Finny, who knows only love and forgiveness, seems to be the only exception to this rule - and because of that, he is destroyed by his best friend. By the end, Gene makes peace with Finny and finally finds peace within. The writer and director missed much of these key elements. Important scenes are brought to life beautifully, but we never really get inside Gene's head, so we can't understand how or why he achieves a 'separate peace.'The writers also decided to omit the other key theme of the book: Finny as a representation of peace in world at war. While Finny talks like he was rearing to go to war, he in fact is unable to do so - because of his leg, but also because it is not possible for him to hate (as Gene describes in the final 'you'd be terrible in a war, Finny!' dialogue). Alas, none of it makes it into the film.All in all, it was great to see a terrific performance by Moore as Finny, as well as some great scenes from the book brought to life (The Headmaster's Tea, The Winter Olympics, The Trial). However, I will still have to wait for a film to be made that is true to the spirit of this American classic.",4,Great casting but misses some key themes of the book,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,2103,"['Separate', 'Peace', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'made', '1974', 'knew', 'Showtime', 'updated', 'version', 'was', 'virtually', 'guaranteed', 'be', 'improvement', 'improvement', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better.First', 'Good', 'role', 'Finny', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'hardest', 'parts', 'out', 'there', 'cast', 'part', 'natural', 'athleticism', 'tremendous', 'charisma', 'truly', 'rare', 'combination', 'especially', 'actors', 'Toby', 'Moore', 'was', 'great', 'casting', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'where', 'came', 'had', 'almost', 'impossible', 'task', 'nailed', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Gene', 'Brinker', 'also', 'performed', 'admirably', 'had', 'script', 'stuck', 'actual', 'Knowles', 'story', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'very', 'special.Now', 'Bad', 'Knowles', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'adolescent', 'friendship', 'betrayal', 'how', 'person', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'peace', 'when', 'forced', 'face', 'own', 'darkness', 'Finny', 'who', 'only', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'be', 'only', 'exception', 'rule', 'destroyed', 'best', 'friend', 'end', 'Gene', 'peace', 'Finny', 'finally', 'peace', 'writer', 'director', 'missed', 'much', 'key', 'elements', 'Important', 'scenes', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'beautifully', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'Gene', 'head', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'why', ""'separate"", 'peace', 'writers', 'also', 'decided', 'omit', 'other', 'key', 'theme', 'book', 'Finny', 'representation', 'peace', 'world', 'war', 'Finny', 'talks', 'was', 'rearing', 'go', 'war', 'fact', 'unable', 'do', 'so', 'leg', 'also', 'not', 'possible', 'hate', 'Gene', 'final', ""'you"", ""'d"", 'be', 'terrible', 'war', 'Finny', 'dialogue', 'Alas', 'none', 'film.All', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Moore', 'Finny', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'scenes', 'book', 'brought', 'life', 'Headmaster', 'Tea', 'Winter', 'Olympics', 'Trial', 'However', 'will', 'still', 'have', 'wait', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'true', 'spirit', 'American', 'classic']",A Separate Peace

However, when it comes to a book like John Knowles' A SEPARATE PEACE stating that the book is better than the film is an understatement. The novel which has undertones of love/hate and admiration/jealousy, set at a boys' prep school during World War II has to be read to be experienced. This is not to say the film is not without merit. This film, originally made for SHOWTIME has many strengths: perfect attention to detail as far as set is concerned, believable actors who seem to belong in a prep school setting, and reasonably good acting. All of these qualities should make a great film. Something fell short for me, however. I think it's because the characters in the book become so real and engrained in a reader's mind, any film version will pale in comparison. I say this as someone who read the book first by choice, then as a requirement in college, and years later taught the book.That being said, of you are thinking about purchasing this film and have never read the book, you may very well enjoy it. As I said, there are many good attributes to this film and people not familiar with the book could find it riveting. If you love the book, you may be somewhat disappointed that the film seems to lack some intensity and may also find it somewhat slow paced. Of course, if you are a student purchasing the film to avoid reading the book, I would not recommend. The film does follow the basic plot line of the novel, but that something that makes A SEPARATE PEACE such a great work is missing in this film version.",3,"Not Bad, But Something's Missing",1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,1643,"['Sometimes', 'whenever', 'words', 'book', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'are', 'uttered', 'can', 'sound', 'somewhat', 'boorish', 'However', 'when', 'book', 'John', 'Knowles', 'A', 'SEPARATE', 'PEACE', 'stating', 'book', 'better', 'film', 'understatement', 'novel', 'undertones', 'love/hate', 'admiration/jealousy', 'set', 'boys', 'prep', 'school', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'be', 'read', 'be', 'experienced', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'merit', 'film', 'originally', 'made', 'SHOWTIME', 'many', 'strengths', 'perfect', 'attention', 'detail', 'as', 'far', 'set', 'concerned', 'believable', 'actors', 'who', 'seem', 'belong', 'prep', 'school', 'setting', 'reasonably', 'good', 'acting', 'qualities', 'should', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'Something', 'fell', 'short', 'however', 'think', 'characters', 'book', 'become', 'so', 'real', 'engrained', 'reader', 'mind', 'film', 'version', 'will', 'pale', 'comparison', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'choice', 'then', 'requirement', 'college', 'years', 'later', 'taught', 'book.That', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'enjoy', 'said', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'attributes', 'film', 'people', 'not', 'familiar', 'book', 'could', 'find', 'riveting', 'love', 'book', 'may', 'be', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'film', 'lack', 'intensity', 'may', 'also', 'find', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'paced', 'course', 'are', 'student', 'purchasing', 'film', 'avoid', 'reading', 'book', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'follow', 'basic', 'plot', 'line', 'novel', 'something', 'SEPARATE', 'PEACE', 'great', 'work', 'missing', 'film', 'version']",A Separate Peace
