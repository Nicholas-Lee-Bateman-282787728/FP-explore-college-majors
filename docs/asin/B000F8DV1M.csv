A lot of people have a problem with its unrealistic sequence of events, and im definitely not going to say that it could happen, but it is just as realistic, if not more realistic than most action movies today. As far as the plot, i found it pretty cool seeing all the steps the criminals in this movie go through in pursuit of the perfect plan to obtain $100 million. The action at the end, even though it is unrealistic to have a man Harrison Ford's age end up defeating 2 younger men in combat, it is really good action. I think that this movie is one where you have to have a certain taste for the movie genre if you are going to like it.

985268,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000F8DV1M,Alistair McHarg,"[0, 0]","Mark Twain once said that the difference between the right word and the word that's almost right is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.  Firewall, starring Harrison Ford, and the still exquisite Virginia Madsen, is a firefly.  It has all the elements of a taut thriller, highly pressurized situations, loathsome baddy, sympathetic good guys, excellent production value, acting, and cinematography. The only thing missing is the thrill.This is such familiar country for Harrison Ford that one wonders if he even needs to look at the scripts anymore.  He's in a jam, his family is in danger, and he must single-handedly battle insane odds and triumph.  Most familiar of all is his pained look, reflecting deep interior anguish.  We are so accustomed to seeing Harrison Ford looking haunted, stoically suffering in silence, that we must wonder if he gets a royalty every time somebody else looks like this.  His acting is fine, indeed the acting is fine throughout, but there's nothing unfamiliar or unexpected happening.Alan Arkin and Robert Forster - both excellent actors - aren't on-screen long enough to help the cause.  The plot offers no ""aha"" twists, which are a staple of films like this.  Worst of all, the evil mastermind - always the fulcrum of a thriller - played by Paul Bettany, gets less interesting and convincing as the film advances.  He begins well, a dispassionate, cerebral Brit that has done his homework very carefully.  But instead of controlled, implied violence - far more powerful in a thriller - he vents his anger impulsively, ironically at his own henchmen.  (Poor leadership skills.)  In the plus column, how he meets his well-deserved fate is totally satisfying.""High-tech"" computer world drama is hard to present on screen; that said, the film fails on this level as well.  It is actually quite low-tech.  The movie ""Inside Man,"" starring Clive Owen, is flawed, but at least it's a bank robbery movie fueled by a very interesting, unexpected idea.

985270,A29X0YEL6O4KZI,B000F8DV1M,"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer""","[1, 1]","For most people the term Firewall brings one of two images. One of these, more for the old-timers, is a large wall made specifically to hold back a fire. The second image that comes to mind, and the correct one for this movie, is an allusive computer term that most people hear about all the time, but don't really know what it is. A firewall is a piece of software or hardware that is specifically made to secure personal and business computer networks. Jack Stanfield, head of Network Security of Landrock Pacific Bank knows all about these security measures.The movie opens to Jack and Beth Stanfield engaging in every day morning practices. Making breakfast, getting the kids ready for school, and getting cleaned up and dressed. From the initial scenes of this film it is made clear that Jack is a family man through and through. A devoted father and loving husband. Work that day for Jack passes normally and without a hitch. That is until he gets in his car to go home. Hiding in the back of his care is Billy Cox, a man who posed as a Security Support business owner to get close to Jack, but really wanted to use Jack to rob the bank that he works so hard to secure. When Jack returns home with Billy Cox's gone still aimed at his head, he arrives to find his family being held captive by Cox's group of criminals. To make sure that no harm comes to his family, Jack has to try and breach the security system that he himself had made impenetrable.Firewall starts as a smart tech-thriller. Harrison Ford plays the character of Jack Stanfield to a tee and Paul Bettany is well-cast as the cold and calculating Bill Cox. Sadly, other then these two actors, the acting was pretty mediocre. Virginia Madsen performs a acceptable, but not believable caring mother. One actress that stood out in this movie, not for her stellar acting, but for her lack of acting skills, is Mary Lynn Rajskub as Jack's secretary, Janet. Her facial work is more or less too distracting to notice any other characters when she is present.What started out as a smart thriller, slowly began to evolve into a second rate action flick. By the end of the film, the climactic escape was predictable and unsurprising as the end of a Tom Clancy novel, which is exactly what this movie was trying to be, but without the coolness of the military. The ending sequence changes gears and lowers the intellectual concept of the plot by making the conclusion a series of over exaggerated and typical action movie points and effects.Another qualm with the movie is the blatant product placement spotted a few times throughout the viewing. For instance, look over Jack's shoulder in the scene where he is giving Billy a tour of the security servers. A huge Dell emblem sits statuesquely on the wall.For what it's worth, Firewall is a decent thriller with the occasional bits of action. Yet, the movie was not enough to elevate someones pulse. With a film like this you want to feel the thrills through your body, but they seem to be dumbed down by poor execution. If the movie had kept the overall theme as from the beginning of the movie, it would have been excellent, but the lapse of quality that slowly devoured the film makes Firewall a slightly better then average action movie.3/5",3,A Matter Of Security,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,3253,"['most', 'people', 'term', 'Firewall', 'one', 'two', 'images', 'One', 'more', 'old-timers', 'large', 'wall', 'made', 'specifically', 'hold', 'back', 'fire', 'second', 'image', 'mind', 'correct', 'one', 'movie', 'allusive', 'computer', 'term', 'most', 'people', 'hear', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'firewall', 'piece', 'software', 'hardware', 'specifically', 'made', 'secure', 'personal', 'business', 'computer', 'networks', 'Jack', 'Stanfield', 'head', 'Network', 'Security', 'Landrock', 'Pacific', 'Bank', 'security', 'measures.The', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Beth', 'Stanfield', 'engaging', 'day', 'morning', 'practices', 'Making', 'breakfast', 'getting', 'kids', 'ready', 'school', 'getting', 'cleaned', 'up', 'dressed', 'initial', 'scenes', 'film', 'made', 'clear', 'Jack', 'family', 'man', 'A', 'devoted', 'father', 'loving', 'husband', 'Work', 'day', 'Jack', 'passes', 'normally', 'hitch', 'car', 'go', 'home', 'Hiding', 'back', 'care', 'Billy', 'Cox', 'man', 'who', 'posed', 'Security', 'Support', 'business', 'owner', 'get', 'close', 'Jack', 'really', 'wanted', 'use', 'Jack', 'rob', 'bank', 'so', 'hard', 'secure', 'When', 'Jack', 'home', 'Billy', 'Cox', 'gone', 'still', 'aimed', 'head', 'find', 'family', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'Cox', 'group', 'criminals', 'make', 'sure', 'harm', 'family', 'Jack', 'try', 'breach', 'security', 'system', 'had', 'made', 'impenetrable.Firewall', 'smart', 'tech-thriller', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'character', 'Jack', 'Stanfield', 'tee', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'well-cast', 'cold', 'calculating', 'Bill', 'Cox', 'Sadly', 'other', 'then', 'two', 'actors', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'mediocre', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'acceptable', 'not', 'believable', 'caring', 'mother', 'One', 'actress', 'stood', 'out', 'movie', 'not', 'stellar', 'acting', 'lack', 'acting', 'skills', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'Jack', 'secretary', 'Janet', 'facial', 'work', 'more', 'less', 'too', 'distracting', 'notice', 'other', 'characters', 'when', 'present.What', 'started', 'out', 'smart', 'thriller', 'slowly', 'began', 'evolve', 'second', 'rate', 'action', 'flick', 'end', 'film', 'climactic', 'escape', 'was', 'predictable', 'unsurprising', 'end', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'novel', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'coolness', 'military', 'ending', 'sequence', 'changes', 'gears', 'intellectual', 'concept', 'plot', 'making', 'conclusion', 'series', 'exaggerated', 'typical', 'action', 'movie', 'points', 'qualm', 'movie', 'blatant', 'product', 'placement', 'spotted', 'few', 'times', 'viewing', 'instance', 'look', 'Jack', 'shoulder', 'scene', 'where', 'giving', 'Billy', 'tour', 'security', 'servers', 'huge', 'Dell', 'statuesquely', 'wall.For', 'what', 'worth', 'Firewall', 'decent', 'thriller', 'occasional', 'bits', 'action', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'elevate', 'someones', 'pulse', 'film', 'want', 'feel', 'thrills', 'body', 'seem', 'be', 'dumbed', 'down', 'poor', 'execution', 'movie', 'had', 'kept', 'overall', 'theme', 'beginning', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'lapse', 'quality', 'slowly', 'devoured', 'film', 'slightly', 'better', 'then', 'average', 'action', 'movie.3/5']",N/A

Probably not fair, after all he only has one face and voice, but I've seen this bit enough and wouldn't pay to see it again.  Harrison used to try to stretch himself, oh well.As to the movie, it is only a passable thriller greatly helped by Paul Bettany's villain.

He can do comedy,drama, action and mystery. Now the bad news, Ford is in the DVD Firewall and it acts like too many other films  and TV shows.Ford plays IT person Jack Stanfield.  Paul Bethany (from Master and Commander, A Beautiful Mind) plays a cold as ice criminal mastermind who kidnapped Stanfield's family. The film sems almost like Desperate Hours with Bogart or the remake with Anthony Hopkins. Bethany starts to pressure Jack to heist 100 million from the computer design he created. Bethany is great as the icey cold mastermind, not as good as he was in Davinci Code.Bethany's character harrassas Stanfield's wife (Sideways's Virginia Madsen) and his family. This is similar to Capr Fear with Gregory Peck or the remake with Nick Nolte. Madsen preformance seem to assail fear in every scream, fear in all her action and still it seem a poor man's choice in her acting.To get the money, he usea gizmos (like an IPOD and plastic tubing) as if MacGuvyer would. Note, I like Ford as Indiana Jones, But Richard Dean Anderson was more suited to do these things Ford does in this film (Note Box set of MacGuvyer Season six is out!-better to get that , rathefr than this film !)He does what asked and the family is still kidnapped, so Ford goes on a one desparation to save his family. Just like Warren Beauty's Dollars, Desparate Hours or in Ford's own Franic (rent that instead of this if yoiu want a Harrison Ford Movie).Ford tries to hold this film together, but fails badly...The plot folds in the action.It seem like twice told tales...I give it 3 stars-One for BEthany, one for Ford and One because I got this as a gift!Bennet Pomerantz  AUDIOWORLD",3,Take Down this Wall,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,1748,"['Let', 'start', 'personal', 'fact', 'think', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'modern', 'day', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'can', 'do', 'comedy', 'drama', 'action', 'mystery', 'Now', 'bad', 'news', 'Ford', 'DVD', 'Firewall', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'TV', 'shows.Ford', 'IT', 'person', 'Jack', 'Stanfield', 'Paul', 'Bethany', 'Master', 'Commander', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'cold', 'ice', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'Stanfield', 'family', 'film', 'almost', 'like', 'Desperate', 'Hours', 'Bogart', 'remake', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Bethany', 'pressure', 'Jack', 'heist', '100', 'million', 'computer', 'design', 'created', 'Bethany', 'great', 'icey', 'cold', 'mastermind', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'Davinci', 'Code.Bethany', 'character', 'harrassas', 'Stanfield', 'wife', 'Sideways', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'family', 'similar', 'Capr', 'Fear', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'remake', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Madsen', 'preformance', 'seem', 'assail', 'fear', 'scream', 'fear', 'action', 'still', 'seem', 'poor', 'man', 'choice', 'acting.To', 'get', 'money', 'gizmos', 'IPOD', 'plastic', 'tubing', 'MacGuvyer', 'would', 'Note', 'like', 'Ford', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'was', 'more', 'suited', 'do', 'things', 'Ford', 'film', 'Note', 'Box', 'set', 'MacGuvyer', 'Season', 'six', 'out', '-better', 'get', 'rathefr', 'film', 'what', 'asked', 'family', 'still', 'kidnapped', 'Ford', 'one', 'desparation', 'save', 'family', 'Just', 'Warren', 'Beauty', 'Dollars', 'Desparate', 'Hours', 'Ford', 'own', 'Franic', 'rent', 'instead', 'yoiu', 'want', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Movie', '.Ford', 'hold', 'film', 'together', 'badly', 'plot', 'folds', 'action.It', 'seem', 'twice', 'told', 'tales', 'give', '3', 'stars-One', 'BEthany', 'one', 'Ford', 'One', 'got', 'gift', 'Bennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']",N/A

When he's not working, he lives with his wife Beth (Virginia Madsen), an architect who designed their home and works from it, and his two kids, Sarah (Carly Schroder), 14, and Andy (Jimmy Bennett), eight.  The first hint he has of trouble is when he discovers that someone has compromised his identity and racked up $93,000 worth of online gambling debts in his name.  But if he thought things couldn't get worse, he soon finds out how wrong he can be, as a smooth-talking crook (Paul Bettany) seizes his home and family to force him to hack into the security system he designed and steal $200,000,000.  The problem is that a recent merger has left him unable to do it in the way his enemy has in mind.  Can he find a way to get his family free, or will he have to improvise--and then rescue his loved ones on his own after all?Ford may be getting older, but he's not slowing down; not only does he do a great turn here as a man in terror for his family and desperately searching for a way to save them *and* thwart the bad guys, but in a climactic fight scene with the boss robber he shows he can still get physical.  Bettany is a truly horrible villain--clearly both brilliant and a psycho, quite willing to kill his own men if they displease him or to threaten or even torture a child--which makes Ford's ordinary-guy heroics all the more believable and affecting.  It may bear a resemblance toPatriot GamesorClear and Present Danger, but it can stand on its own merits, thanks largely to the involved computer angle; and since Ford isn't expected to be an action hero for most of its length, he can better showcase his acting talents while still making his character both plausible and sympathetic.

985279,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000F8DV1M,Chris Kennison,"[3, 4]","The movies good. It would have been better twenty years ago, but audiences are more intelligent these days. Audiences are more familiar with movies these days and you have to do MORE in order to entertain and to impress.I had heard a review or two say that Harrison Ford was losing his ability to sell an action film, but I strongly disagree. I thought he was very believable and proves that he is STILL one of the strongest movie actors around. In fact, all of the actors did a great job. Virgina Madsen, Paul Bettany, Carly Schroeder, Jimmy Bennett & Mary Lynn Rajskub from ""24"" were all solid.The movie, too, moved well. It held my interest but as my review title suggests: there was nothing new here. It was a typical formulaic suspense, kidnap, heist thriller. Twenty years ago, when audiences hadn't seen 100 movies just like this, it probably would have faired better.Which brings me to my BIGGEST complaint of the film. The movie makers had the plot wrinkle, the film idea that in my opinon is the KISS of DEATH. And it showed. The bad guys kidnapped the FAMILY. The wife. The 9 year-old son. The 13 year-old daughter. So, why is this the kiss of death? Because throughtout the film, they do numerous things that a real life kidnapper would have killed one of them or at least dismembered or hurt one of them. Instead, the only ones that the kidnapper ever hurts are members of his OWN TEAM! Because Hollywoods mentality IS if you hurt a little kid like that... you'll lose your audience. I say... Bull. But, throughout the film, you just know that the filmmakers aren't gonna have the nuts to hurt one of those kids, so it ruins it.And believe me. You'll wonder after Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford) tries to be brave three...four...five times in one day. Why the heck the kidnappers haven't put a bullet in one of his family members yet? Because you know a real life bad guy would. That, to me, was the biggest problem with the film. They didn't dare to be different and the so the film ended up being just another of the same ol' same ol'.",3,Nothing NEW here,1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,2049,"['movies', 'good', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'audiences', 'are', 'more', 'intelligent', 'days', 'Audiences', 'are', 'more', 'familiar', 'movies', 'days', 'have', 'do', 'MORE', 'order', 'entertain', 'impress.I', 'had', 'heard', 'review', 'two', 'say', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'was', 'losing', 'ability', 'sell', 'action', 'film', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'STILL', 'one', 'strongest', 'movie', 'actors', 'around', 'fact', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Virgina', 'Madsen', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Carly', 'Schroeder', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', '24', 'were', 'solid.The', 'movie', 'too', 'moved', 'well', 'held', 'interest', 'review', 'title', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'was', 'typical', 'formulaic', 'suspense', 'kidnap', 'heist', 'thriller', 'Twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'audiences', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', '100', 'movies', 'just', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'faired', 'better.Which', 'brings', 'BIGGEST', 'complaint', 'film', 'movie', 'makers', 'had', 'plot', 'wrinkle', 'film', 'idea', 'opinon', 'KISS', 'DEATH', 'showed', 'bad', 'guys', 'kidnapped', 'FAMILY', 'wife', '9', 'year-old', 'son', '13', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'So', 'why', 'kiss', 'death', 'film', 'do', 'numerous', 'things', 'real', 'life', 'kidnapper', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'one', 'least', 'dismembered', 'hurt', 'one', 'Instead', 'only', 'ones', 'kidnapper', 'ever', 'hurts', 'are', 'members', 'OWN', 'TEAM', 'Hollywoods', 'mentality', 'IS', 'hurt', 'little', 'kid', ""'ll"", 'lose', 'audience', 'say', 'Bull', 'film', 'just', 'know', 'filmmakers', 'are', ""n't"", 'gon', 'have', 'nuts', 'hurt', 'one', 'kids', 'it.And', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'Jack', 'Stanfield', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'be', 'brave', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'times', 'one', 'day', 'Why', 'heck', 'kidnappers', 'have', ""n't"", 'put', 'bullet', 'one', 'family', 'members', 'yet', 'know', 'real', 'life', 'bad', 'guy', 'would', 'was', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'dare', 'be', 'different', 'so', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'just', 'same', 'ol', 'same', 'ol']",N/A
985280,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000F8DV1M,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","""Firewall"" is the type of movie that could easily satisfy the action/thriller buff, and rightfully so; there are plenty of suspenseful, nail biting moments for all to experience. And I'm sure a lot of people will be enticed by its almost universal structure. It's basically a heist movie, the only difference being that twenty-first century technology is at its disposal. The fact that we live in a computer driven society is used to the fullest, pretty much to the point of flaunting it. It's now unnecessary to present physical money: bundles of green bills wrapped with paper strips are nowhere to be found; the black leather bag to stuff the money into is also missing. It's all digitally processed, with a series of pin numbers and codes being all that's needed to access account information. And this time around, a robbery entails the mere pushing of a laptop keyboard button. No guns, ski masks, or crowbars are required.And yet, despite the technological upgrades, it's still just your run of the mill bank robbery story: unoriginal, at times highly implausible, and always completely predictable. I suppose that may be an unfair assessment, and the truth is I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting going into this movie. Maybe I just wanted the drama and action to unfold in fresher ways. But that's probably asking too much; heist films of the past have been so formulaic that certain expectations have been permanently ingrained into our collective subconscious.Harrison Ford stars as Jack Stanfield: a security specialist for a small bank branch in Seattle. Right as the movie starts, we are given glimpses into his life (some of which are mysteriously viewed through a telephoto lens). He and his architect wife, Beth (Virginia Madsen), live the typical upper class suburbanite life with their children, Sarah and Andrew (Carly Schroeder and Jimmy Bennett). We see them in the morning, just as Stanfield is leaving for work. Automatic pleasantries are shared, the kids squabble over nothing (Sarah goes so far as to address her father by his first name), and Stanfield kisses his wife goodbye. We even see some average encounters at the office, the most prominent ones occurring between Stanfield and his secretary, Janet (Mary Lynn Rajskub).Some may view this type of introduction as uninteresting; indeed, the opening does lack some of the conventional attention grabbers. But when the events of the robbery are set into motion later on in the film, it becomes clear why the beginning was so bland: it was the only way to make the shock of the unfolding crime seem more intense.Eventually Stanfield is introduced to Bill Cox (Paul Bettany), the man in charge of planning the entire robbery. It starts out innocently enough when Cox poses as another bank executive looking to make a deal (while faking an American accent). But Stanfield is unaware that a band of Cox's henchmen have already broken into his home and taken his family hostage. That's when Stanfield sees Cox's camera phone, displaying a picture of Sarah screaming. ""She has lovely eyes, your daughter,"" Cox says coldly (dropping the American accent). It's the first in a series of events indicating that Cox has definitely done his homework. That's when the demands are made: if Stanfield wishes to see his family alive again, then he must break into the bank's system and rewire a certain amount of money into Cox's personal account.I suppose you now see what I mean about this being pretty unoriginal. But that's only the start of the film's problems, not the least of which are the moments between the Stanfield family and Cox's team of computer geeks and hit men. Beth and the kids were tied up and gagged at gunpoint, and their lives are verbally threatened on more than one occasion. I figured this would be enough to instill uncontrollable fear in them. But apparently it wasn't; after the initial shock wears off, they go about the house seemingly oblivious to the danger they're in. The kids play games and Beth prepares meals. They're all allowed to sleep in the comfort of the master bedroom (granted; they're being supervised through a surveillance camera). There are even some friendly moments shared between Andrew and Cox. Call me crazy, but is this really the behavior you'd expect from people whose lives are on the line? I don't know; I guess I was expecting the drama to go a little further than that.I was also turned off by the inclusion of Robert Patrick as the bank's new boss (the old boss being Alan Arkin). His part was introduced well enough, especially since there's some uncomfortable friction between him and Stanfield. But as the plot ensued, his presence, along with his significance, decreased dramatically. By the end of the film, I suspected his character was included only as an afterthought (but to what avail, I have no idea).Fans of Harrison Ford will find him enjoyable, and he certainly did seem quite comfortable playing this role. It's really no wonder; the number of action films he's been in had long ago pushed him into the category of Typecast Actor. I tend to think that as long as there's a breath left in his body, he'll continue to be offered these kinds of roles. That might be a problem, considering his performance in ""Firewall."" His delivery was flat and his voice was monotone throughout the film; not even the threat of losing his family seemed to be enough to get a decent rise out of him. Maybe he was a little too comfortable playing Jack Stanfield. Maybe he's a little too comfortable in action films altogether.This isn't a bad film by any means, but it's nothing to write home about, either. Yes, it was quite interesting to watch a present day bank robbery in action (and the fact that the technology behind it was completely beyond me only heightened my interest). But I would have liked it if the characters' emotional responses were a little more realistic. I also would have liked the basic premise to not be so cookie cutter, following the patterns and copying the outcomes of all the old-fashioned bank robber films. That, above all things, was what made ""Firewall"" difficult to sit through. I can only hope that future heist films are made with some degree of story originality. Maybe then it would be worth paying the local theater's ticket price.",3,Robbed of Originality,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,6301,"['Firewall', 'type', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'satisfy',

He plays Jack Stanfield who is a pretty talented VP of security for a smallish bank that is in the middle of a takeover by a huge bank that is planning on getting, well, huger.  Our hero is none too pleased about the takeover and is vocal about it.  We see over the opening titles that Jack is being watched, but by whom?  The new boss of security in the new parent bank is Gary Mitchell (played very effectively by Robert Patrick).  He comes across that he will stop at nothing to get what he wants.  Is he behind this?  What about the sudden amazingly good offer from entrepreneur Bill Cox (played with the right presence by Paul Bettany)?  Why that offer and why now?  It seems to make sense now that Jack's senior position is going away.  Wouldn't he rather be his own boss rather than a step lower in a bigger machine?The always wonderful Virginia Madsen plays Jack's wife.  She is a talented architect who even designed the house they live in.  The indifferent put upon teenage daughter who hasn't a clue how great a life she has, Sarah, is played to perfection by Carly Schroeder.  Andy is the young son with a peanut allergy and played with the right amount of boyish curiosity and too much friendliness is played by Jimmy Bennet.  They become the lever that is used against Jack, but I won't reveal how or why.  That unfolding is the whole point and pleasure of the movie.As things unfold, I like the way they keep Jack struggling.  He is not a superhero.  He is slow to climb over things and doesn't run so well.  When he jumps down something, he stumbles and knocks over a chair.  When the fighting happens, he is more passionate than skilled.  This is a computer jock after all, not a member of the CIA or the Delta Force.  Heck, he probably has never even taken a martial arts class.Mary Lynn Rajskub is great as Jack's admin, Janet Stone.  She does her best, but gets put upon.  Is she in on the plot or not?  What about the big boss of the bank being bought, Arlin Forester (I really enjoy seeing Alan Arkin as often as I can)?  Is he watching Jack so the merger isn't derailed?  What!?Really, once things get underway, the plot isn't a big mystery.  Nor are the things that happen to Jack and his family things we haven't seen before.  Still, the movie works in its own way, especially if you don't think about it too quickly.  Like most thrillers, you have to suspend your understanding of reality and think sloooowly so you don't get ahead of things.

Obviously, things have changed a great deal since then, but it's still a fact that the biggest potential threat to any leader, company, or business is the guy who designed the security system.  Crooks are well aware of this very thing, which brings us to the movie Firewall.Harrison Ford plays Jack Stanfield, the network security chief at a medium-sized bank.  After spending many years doing everything he can to protect his customers' data, he suddenly finds himself on the other side of the firewall when crooks take his wife and children hostage and demand he help them steal the bank blind by transferring a cool hundred million out of the accounts of its wealthiest customers.  With his loved ones' lives on the line, he has little choice but to comply with their demands.  Kept under constant surveillance and oftentimes accompanied by one of the conspirators, he has to go about his daily business, acting as if everything is fine, while trying to figure out the best way of bypassing his own security setup.  Eventually, of course, he fights back, setting the stage for a rather action-packed ending.The whole robbery plan is pretty darned elaborate.  These guys would have needed to rob another bank just to be able to afford all of the equipment they put to use on this job.  I definitely would have asked for more than 100 million dollars if I was the one who put the whole plan together.Say what you will about the film's lack of originality, but I found Firewall to be a pretty exhilarating thriller.  There's a lot of detail to the story, especially in terms of the way the crooks set Jack up for the fall, and the pace of the movie works well (the nagging questions I had about the plot didn't really hit me until after the film was over).  As usual, Harrison Ford makes this film more successful than it would have been otherwise, but Paul Bettany does his part as well.  Bettany plays Bill Cox, the brains and muscle behind the robbery plot and the only half-way interesting or well-developed character among the motley crew of criminals.  Whenever Cox got frustrated or angry, he seemed to start channeling Christopher Walken, which I found rather amusing.  Other than that, though, it's a serious, suspenseful film that I would rank higher than a lot of similar action films.I'm not a huge fan of movies in this particular genre, but I really enjoyed Firewall.

And Harrison Ford, that old dog, he's still got it. And by ""it"" I don't mean acting prowess, but screen presence.In Firewall he plays a computer expert that looks downright silly in front of a computer. Ford's hands are those of a carpenter not a computer geek. Still, he works because he plays a fish out of water: a president turned action hero, archeologist turned Nazi hunter, CIA analyst turned drug warrior, doctor turned fugitive, smuggler turned star captain, and, in Firewall's case, techie turned bank robber.Ford is Jack Stanfield, a bank's head security man. When his family is kidnapped and held hostage within their home, Jack's only hope of getting them out alive is to obey the somewhat pleasant bad guy, Bill Cox (Paul Bettany), who demands Jack hack into his own bank and do what most computer hacking movies require: steal $10,000 from 10,000 wealthy accounts. Because no one ever notices when $100 million goes missing.Bettany is a better actor than the material will allow him to be, but he's British, and accents make for great villains. He's shown here as a suave gentleman with respectable manners and trim suits. Jack flips out when he catches his son enjoying Bill's bad guy pancakes, which almost prompts the movie's greatest line, ""Son, no blueberry pancakes with the kidnapper ... but buttermilk's OK.""Firewall builds up and up and up until Jack is eventually (finally) stealing the money, which he does with a scanner from a disassembled fax machine and his daughter's iPod. The fact that this scheme is even tried -- forget that it's successful -- would make MacGyver wet himself. That's part of the fun, though: Firewall flies by the seat of its pants, even when it dabbles in fantasy.The movie surpasses other films of the same genre in small ways that I admire. For one, Bill presents his plan to Jack, who dismisses the whole thing as impossible. Rather than hold cute infants or handicapped nuns at gunpoint until Jack concedes to the plan, Bill's face turns white and he stands there like a dope holding a memory card that can't fit into the bank's computers. He's stunned that all his careful planning has yielded approximately zero dollars and one stack of pancakes. I liked Die Hard, but I was pleasantly pondering what the film would have been like if the bad guys didn't have all the answers like Firewall.Despite all the careful, and not-so-careful, planning, Bill and Firewall lead up to a fistfight and shootout in a lakeside cabin. Did this conclusion surprise me? Not really. It's the best ending a film like this can expect given the quality of the writing. Below-average script or not, though, here's a film that doesn't joke around about what it is. Firewall is dreck. It knows this and appreciates it.

This is an identity theft genre film taken to the extreme.  There are other films that deal with identity theft that are more believable, for instance The Net, starring Sandra Bullock.  I'm naturally cynical, I suppose, but I kept asking myself, how could the bad guy in this film expect that he could possibly get away with this. This plot could have been more believable that if a terrorist group plotted to carry something out like this to fund their other terrorist operations rather than some greedy, murderous fiend who wanted to live a life of luxury  on a South Sea Island. Other than that, there were enough elements that kept me interested  enough to see it through to the end.  However, I doubt that I would ever want to watch it again.

I was so relieved to sign on and see I wasn't the only one who felt this way.  I will definitely refer to Amazon reviews before my future rentals.This movie reminded me so much of many of the Harrison Ford films of the past 10 years.  He is an executive, with a specialized knowledge, who gets caught up in a web of deceit and destruction.  Somehow he is made to look like the guilty party.  But in the end, justice prevails, and he is exonerated of all ""crimes"" committed.But there were LOTS of problems with this one!  LOTS of problems!TIRED PLOTFirst of all, the plot was tired and clich&eacute;d.  Most of the movie, except for a short 20 minute segment I found myself completely bored!  I kept checking the time of the movie, thinking that it must be getting close to the 1 1/2 hour mark.  But it just dragged on and on.LOTS OF LOOSE ENDSWhen I say loose ends, I'm not necessarily talking about unexplained or unfinished plot stories, but I'm talking about clich&eacute;d happenings, without any sort of resolution.Like (SPOILERS AHEAD)1)The whole business about his credit being compromised: what was that all about?  First of all, no online Gambling service is gonna give you credit.  You use a credit card, and they charge you, simple as that.  It would have made more sense for his Credit card company to call him, about his non-paid credit card.  What if that thug from the gambling joint had shown up, and Harrison Ford's character had called in sick that day?  STUPID scene!!!  I found myself thinking about that illogical sequence, and it interfered with my enjoyment of the movie.  And it just got worse and worse!Why couldn't they have had an earlier (or later) scene that explained that interaction, to disclose to the audience, the director's point?  It meant nothing to me, and just interrupted my enjoyment.2) Firing of the staff at Harrison Ford's workplace.  Wouldn't it have been nice to find out the conclusion and explanation of them being fired?  It wasn't enough to see him come to the female secretary's apartment.  For help?  Why the hell would she be helping that lunatic now?  He had just fired her.  But the director could have made that segment more believable.3)The hoods keeping his family hostage was completely non-believable!  They looked like computer geeks, not hardened criminals.  I thought Robert Forester's roll was half baked and wasted!  Harrison Ford, himself, looked half asleep throughout the entire movie.  Was it filmed in real time?4) The ending was terrible!  I couldn't believe it when the credits started to roll.  Certainly there was some mistake!  What about all the people back at the office?  Maybe we could see him apologizing to the head of security  He had nearly run him over in the garage.  What about the bank manager at the airport?I could go on and on.  Suffice it to say, this movie stunk to high heaven!  I'm really glad I did not purchase it.Two thumbs down!

The bank is due to merge with a huge conglomerate purportedly to enhance business and increase assets. Jack has conservative views regarding risk-taking and protecting the assets of customers. This strong stance stood him well for 20 years but places him in a dimlight with the new owners at the board meeting who are willing to risk the money of customers for future earnings. He is introduced to several high level entrepeneurs and associates believed to be associated with the new firm. The meeting is occuring right about when the banking network is being attacked by computer hackers who invaded Jack's home and are holding his family hostage.The unexpected break in to Jack's house begins the tension that keeps mounting as more details are revealed regarding the reason for the kidnapping. Jack's wife, daughter and young son are threatened with physical harm ... the team of five stop at nothing to get what they want. Jack understands the seriousness of their threats when Bill Cox the leader, shoots one of his own men in the head after he failed to follow directions and nearly foiled their plans. He proved his point: Jack agreed to do what they wanted -- break into his bank's software, override the firewall, and transfer money to an account in the Cayman Islands. His wife and children nearly manage an escape before they are caught and sent back into confinement. Bill Cox punishes Jack by letting Jack's son almost die of an allergic reaction to peanuts ... The family realizes, they know too much to be allowed to live if Bill Cox and his team manage the money transfer ...Jack desperately goes along with all the plans by moving money and changing information on the banks software -  while plotting to overthrow Bill COx and his team. Harrison Ford plays a gutsy, tough, family man who fights with everything he has to save his family, to keep them alive. This film is filled with edge-of-your seat moments. It has a well developed plot, great actors, and a very satisfactory ending. At times, the scenes can be gruesome but the acting is superb and required for the theme. Anyone who loves to see Harrison Ford at his utmost best ... should see this film. He is one of the few great leading actors of modern times.

I'm seriously dissapointed with this movie becuase I had such high hopes about it. There were a lot of things that peaked my interest but they all got dragged down by several things. I will admit that the movie had a strong cast, impressive techno-skills on hacking, and great stunts and general stuff like that. But when you combine the dry performances with the recycled plot; it just feels like same stuff, different characters. Why? Becuase we have all seen it before in other thrillers.Within the movie, there are heavy chunks of wooden dialogue and tense moments shoved in between. Not to say that it wasn't acted well, but the lines of dialogue seemed forced rather than articulated. The story, although new, has little to do for today's audience.Plus, in all honesty, the movie is, dare I say, Long. Too long. And if that isn't the bad part, it's also that the movie ended so abruptly.

Cox is the mastermind behind a simple but effective plan that involves transfer of $100 million from Jack's bank to his bank accounts in Caymans by forcing Jack to hack the very security system he had created for the bank while keeping Jack's wife and two children as hostages. The only person who may help Jack is his assistant Janet Stone (Mary Lynn Rajskub, basically repeating the part of Chloe O'Brian of ""24""). If you forget that Harrison is 63 and it is sometimes painful to watch him in the action scenes, you may actually enjoy the movie. I like Paul Bettany as a polite, charming sociopath.

It was an interesting movie in that it was a new twist on bank robberies. This one was ultra high tech. The bank robbers, seemingly very decent fellows, at least at first, captured the bank president (Ford) and his family and held them as prisoners in their house. They then let Ford go back to work at the bank as if nothing was wrong, but with the threat that if he did anything to thwart the robbery plans, his wife and family would be killed. It was an interesting premise, one that I hadn't seen before. Okay, then Ford went back to the bank, even with one of the robbers, to set up the high-tech heist of withdrawing the funds without drawing undue attention and depositing them in an offshore account. Sorta fascinating and it makes you wonder if this is actually possible.Well, of course, nothing goes perfectly as planed even in a high-tech robbery. Or maybe, especially in a high-tech robbery.  So, when  things started to go astray the whole plan quickly degenerated into an action film with chase scenes, gunfire,  fist fights, explosions,  etc. It was an interesting movie, well done and well worth watching, but not particularly compelling. The first half was very interesting. The second half was so-so action adventure. The acting, directing and filming was quite good.

I like the selection of actors and the scene dynamics. The Action, music, and acting were suspenseful.Plot: Jack is head of computer security, at a local bank in Seattle with 27 branches and an airtight security system. Jack misdirects hackers by leading them to false accounts. The thieves realize they can't penetrate the system, so seek an inside job.Identity theft occurs and Jack is accused of Internet gambling fraud of $95,000.Jack wrote the banking software and understands the security systems. Jack and Henry are involved in merger takes with a large bank with over $200 million dollars in assets. A theft and his five-team (impersonating pizza delivery) kidnap Jacks family and force him to steal $100 millions deliverable to five Cayman offshore accounts. Sarah, the daughter, asks one of the thieves,"" why do you hate us"" and he replies, ""Sarah, I don't hate you - I just don't care about you."" After the death of the first thief, Beth starts working on convincing the remaining thieves that Cox will not let them live because he wants all the money for himself. The thieves don't seem persuaded by her comments, with the exception of one, but he does little to aid in their escape.Cox is cruel. He purposefully causes the little boy, Andrew to go into an allergic seizure, after feeding a cookie with nuts. Jack must beg for the medication. At that point Jack decides he must steal the money.The thieves like the Cayman accounts for its low income tax. Jack uses an ipod and fax scanner input to record maintenance screen images of accounts and then uses optical character recognition to reverse the images into text for upload into the thieves' databases. The thieves have a way to setup accounts in the Cayman Islands.Jack fires his secretary. Jack uses Bills PDA to take a picture of wire account; he uses to transfer the $100 million dollars. Later, Jack tells his secretary, he was forced to fire her by thieves, and they need Bill's pda. Bill has been chasing the secretary and leaving flowers and inviting her to religious revivals. Jack uses the wire account to reverse the $100 million back into the bank, believing he will protect his family. Cox has plans to kill the family and takes them to a remote house near a lake. Jack uses the dogs GPS tracking system to local the family and rescue them. Jack saves the bank and his family.It is unclear, if Henry was involved in theft. Cox discloses to Jack that they were inside already at the time of introduction. Cox had control of Jacks computer when he tries to send a emergency email. Henry tells Cox, he can't believe the deal is happening. What deal is Henry excited about.Jack discovered encrypted files under the name ""cox"". Henry was the person who introduced Cox to Jack. Cox introduces himself as an entrepreneur.After Cox obtains the electronic money, he frames Jack for the murder of Henry. The plot was Henry was having an affair with Jack's wife, Beth, and Jack kills Henry in Jealous rages after Jack discovers the affair. Jack then was to disappear and the thieves escape with their money.However, Jack is hiding at the time of Henry murder by Cox, and kills the thief assigned to kill him. Jack reverses the action by taking back the thieves money by wire transfer and tracks down Cox.Cox himself kills two his team and Jack kills three (one with a food mixture and the other by automobile) and one in a fight.

At a meeting with a potential investor (Paul Bettany) our hero is kind and casual only to be kidnapped by Bettany and taken to his home where his wife (Virginia Madsen) and children are being held ransom by Bettany's crew (including handsome Nikolaj Coster-Waldau who costarred with Bettany in 'Wimbledon'). The aim: get Ford to gain access into the bank's assets and transfer the funds to Bettany's off shore account. How this all tediously works out is the movies plot.An odd factor here: there are numerous famous actors in bit parts (Alan Arkin, Robert Forster, Robert Patrick) that seem like PR padding.

Bill Cox (Paul Bettany), the mastermind behind it all, gives Jack (Harrison Ford) this option: steal 100 million from a Seattle bank, of which Jack is the chief of security - or Jack's family dies. The cat-and-mouse games begin when Jack seeks to thwart the callous but vigilant Bill Cox, who in turn seems to anticipate and foil Jack's attempts. The tension is ratcheted higher and higher as Jack's every scheme of escape goes awry and Cox's temper is further tested. Later, his family having vanished, the friend he desperately turns to having just been murdered, and having no other recourse, Jack must rely on his savvy secretary Janet Stone (who he had just fired) for help. Where's Han Solo when you need him?Harrison Ford once again ably portrays a role he's pigeonholed for himself:  that of the cerebral action hero. Holy Octogenarian, Ford is looking ancient (any forthcoming Indy Jones film better happen sooner than later). But his advancing age actually works in his favor, making the peril more credible. Jack Stanfield is older and greyer and, looking at him, one isn't entirely sure he'll be able to overcome adversity. But, fortunately, while the physical nature is diminished in Ford, the intelligence and suppressed intensity remain. Paul Bettany is an actor who is up and coming; his star is definitely on the rise. In his yet early carrer, he's already played several eclectic parts: from his verbose Geoffrey Chaucer (A Knight's Tale) to the cello-playing Dr. Maturin (Master & Commander), from the romantic lead Peter Colt (Wimbledon) to Silas, the tortured albino villain, in The Da Vinci Code. Here he brings an icy British demeanor to his greedy and amoral kidnapper character. To be honest, I don't think his Bill Cox vicious enough. On separate occasions, he places members of Jack's family in jeopardy, only to not follow thru, on Jack's pleading behest. No wonder Jack keeps rebelling. Virginia Madsen offers an earnest performance with her thankless role of kidnapped mother. The kid actors are...well, they don't get in the way. Robert Patrick adds his own brand of internalized focus and Alan Arkin and good old Robert Forster have good bit parts. Mary Lynn Rajskub's Janet Stone is reminiscent of her Chloe from 24, which isn't a bad thing.Firewall isn't up to par with most of the pictures in Harrison Ford's scintillating resume, but having said that, it's still a pretty decent offering served up by this iconic film star. Not overtly familiar with computer technology, I don't have an expert opinion about the computer-oriented doings and their working validity. To be honest, I glossed over all the techno-babble, preferring to pay closer attention to the more diverting jeopardy presented in those same scenes. I still don't quite get the thing about the iPod. Sometimes, I really miss the abacus. Anyways, this is an intense thriller, with director Richard Loncraine never allowing the audience to forget about the family's peril for one sec.

985318,A7PZZXJJZM4N2,B000F8DV1M,Isaac,"[0, 0]","""Firewall"" is another one of those thrillers where the only way you can enjoy it is to leave your brain at the door. You have to forgive the film a few transgressions and implausibilites in order make it a commendable experience. With Richard Loncraine's new film, there is no way that you can, because the mounting elements of ""Firewall"" end up leaving a bland taste in your mouth after it's over. Viewers will wonder how, for an example, Harrison Ford can do the things he does in the movie, at the age of sixty-three.The years have gone by since ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" when we saw Ford doing what he does best and with the right charisma. Not to say that in ""Firewall"" he doesn't have the right charisma, it's just that his character is marred with the acute effects old age, even though Ford looks younger than he really is. He is apparently in good enough shape to overtake villains who are half his age and well-experienced in weapons training and combat. That principle is questionable only when it happens, because much of the film involves Ford using his brain power and responding to situations using improvisation, like the Jodie Foster characters in ""Panic Room"" and ""Flightplan.""Being more than familiar with ""Air Force One,"" I already knew that Ford was capable of a role like this one. The thing is, he gave his character more of a convincing drive in ""Air Force One."" He responded to situations, frightened at first, and then more casually and aggressively as he worked his way through the ranks of the villains. There is a moment near the end of ""Firewall"" where he manages to gorge an attacker in the back with a pick axe, and damned if Ford doesn't look like he thinks it's impossible.It sounds like I'm trashing Ford when I'm really not. I'm merely observing that he himself is convincing but his character isn't. I've been watching Ford for years, and here he has much of the confidence he had thirty-six years ago when he did ""American Grafitti."" He's tall and slender, with a gaze that can speak caution, alarm, and fury, and a tone in his speech that makes him a man of confidence and determination. A lot of actors can't fit this kind of high-order criteria, but Ford does. It's a shame that the film he occupies, then, isn't as in-tune as he is.Ford plays Jack Stanfield, the security chief for a line of banks in the Pacific northwest. He designed a security system that is nearly impossible to beat, one that is programmed to perfection, right down to the last one and zero. There is a potential client who pays him a visit. His name is Bill Cox (Paul Bettany), and he intercepts Jack in his car, pulls out a gun, and tells Jack that he has his wife Beth (Virgina Madsen), his daughter Sarah (Carly Schroeder), and his son Andy (Jimmy Bennett) taken hostage at their cliffside home.Jack is wired with an audio feed and a camera that sees everything he sees. He is then instructed to hack into the security system that he created, produce a list of the ten thousand richest customers across the United States, and deduct ten thousand dollars from each account. This he does, but later on, when a number of complications arise, he begins to turn the tables on his family's kidnappers. He enlists the aid of his secretary, Janet (Mary Lynn Rajskub, from TV's ""24""), whom he was forced to fire earlier that day by Cox, and begins to locate his family when they are being transferred from the their house to a remote location. How he does it is plausible if a little rediculous, but its the ending I'm concerned about. How is everything wrapped up? Kill the bad guy and all your problems are solved, of course.Much of the movie shows Jack having to evade his co-workers, mainly Gary Mitchell (Robert Patrick), who begins sniffing around when Jack's actions become a little suspicious. It also involves the improvised use of modern technology, at one point an iPod, and goes for the jugular when a dog collar is used at a moment of desperation. I had no problem with any of this. I like thrillers that acknowledge the use of invention. What burps me up about ""Firewall"" is that--dare I use the cliche?--we have seen it done before.I can imagine that thrillers are difficult to write, but that is no excuse. What drove ""Panic Room"" and ""Flightplan"" is that intelligence was adequately supplied to both, while ""Firewall"" bends on momentary surprises and developments. I can't recall a single moment in the film where something happened that can take an audience by surprise. Most of the story is simple: Jack is being used a pawn in a robbery. He will be the culprit and Cox will walk away with millions of dollars in his account if all goes according to plan, and Jack and his family will surely die.The story is left to fend for itself while the cast gives the film a solid foundation. Madsen, as Jack's architect wife, secretes her character with desperation and inferiority, which is rare because most movie hostages often try crazy means of escape while she depends soley on the heroism of her husband. Bettany is a most effective villain, who is, unsurprisingly, British, and has a nack for getting cranky when he doesn't get what he wants or when his associates do not cooperate with him. But ""Firewall"" is a Ford-driven film. In the end, although you can't quite buy the level of plausibility that Jack Stanfield possesses, a fourth ""Indiana Jones"" film doesn't seem like that bad of an idea. Ford has another one left in him.I stand firm by my own opinion, which is that when thrillers maintain plausibility and don't wonder away from what they are capable of, they aren't as much of a chore to watch. If hacking into computers is this easy, then Jack should consider redesigning the system, because if a pre-teen can design a computer virus that can blow Wall Street to hell, then the system in this bank would be a hacker's field day. Watching ""Firewall,"" I was impressed less than half of the time, and disappointed more than half of the time. - IsaacRated PG-13; 106 minutes; Directed by Richard

When his family is kidnapped he is forced to help steal $100,000,000 from his own bank as a ransom for his family.Sounds like a part of nearly every season of Fox's 24.  This even includes Mary Lynn Rajskub as his loyal assistant Janet Stone.  Mary Lynn Rajskub coincidently plays Chloe on 24 who is the loyal computer geek at CTU.  On 24, Jack or another character often has their family or loved ones kidnapped and, with Mary Lynn Rajskub's help, will sacrifice anything in order to get them back (even millions of other people's lives if necessary).  So the entire time I'm thinking that Firewall is just a waterred down version of any 24 season.  It doesn't have as many plot twists and is nowhere near as entertaining as 24.

However, being a fan of Harrison Ford, I decided to give it a shot. What you have here is Harrison Ford placed in a business suit and then later have  him fight someone conveniently wearing all black, and you'd swear you were watching any number of movies from the last fifteen years, more like a Indian Jones but in a gated community.Even though this film is more like a play-it-safe campaign it also show the world that Ford isn't too old, so eventually he is pushed into ""Firewall"". It's been more than fourteen years since, ""Patriot Games"", in which Ford played a man that seemed over the hill then, and here he is today in the same situations. To jog your memory, Ford has been making a living playing essentially the same character in similar situations for years, thanks to the aforementioned ""Patriot Games"", ""The Fugitive"", and ""Air Force One,"" He plays these roles exceptionally well and the same goes for ""Firewall"". The other performances in the film are convincing. Virginia Madsen is good as the relaxed wife considering the situation her character was put through.It has your expected twists and seemingly smart moments, but nothing that will truly make you go ""wow"". The fist fight choreography can get pretty intense, however, there's no need to reach the end of the road before you know who's gonna emerge tops. It isn't exactly a bad movie, but one which doesn't even have a single sequence that can redeem this picture from really bad mediocrity. This film will appeal to families, and hardcore Harrison Ford fans.",3,Another signature from Harrison Ford.,1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,1626,"['Honestly', 'spite', 'having', 'read', 'detailed', 'description', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'However', 'being', 'fan', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'placed', 'business', 'suit', 'then', 'later', 'have', 'fight', 'someone', 'conveniently', 'wearing', 'black', ""'d"", 'swear', 'were', 'watching', 'number', 'movies', 'last', 'fifteen', 'years', 'more', 'Indian', 'Jones', 'gated', 'community.Even', 'film', 'more', 'play-it-safe', 'campaign', 'also', 'show', 'world', 'Ford', ""n't"", 'too', 'old', 'so', 'eventually', 'pushed', 'Firewall', 'been', 'more', 'fourteen', 'years', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'Ford', 'played', 'man', 'seemed', 'hill', 'then', 'here', 'today', 'same', 'situations', 'jog', 'memory', 'Ford', 'been', 'making', 'living', 'playing', 'essentially', 'same', 'character', 'similar', 'situations', 'years', 'thanks', 'aforementioned', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'Fugitive', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'roles', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'same', 'Firewall', 'other', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'convincing', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'good', 'relaxed', 'wife', 'considering', 'situation', 'character', 'was', 'put', 'through.It', 'expected', 'twists', 'seemingly', 'smart', 'moments', 'nothing', 'will', 'truly', 'make', 'go', 'wow', 'fist', 'fight', 'choreography', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'intense', 'however', 'need', 'reach', 'end', 'road', 'know', 'who', 'gon', 'emerge', 'tops', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'bad', 'movie', 'one', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'single', 'sequence', 'can', 'redeem', 'picture', 'really', 'bad', 'mediocrity', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'families', 'hardcore', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'fans']",N/A
985323,ANNLMATZ4GOJP,B000F8DV1M,"jermy man ""jerm""","[4, 7]","Upon first renting Firewall i had mixed feelings, mainly because Ford hasnt had a worth while film come out for almost 5 years and i wasnt sure about the whole storyline. Also i had to almost snicker when i found out they will be coming out with another Indiana Jones in 2007, mainly because of Fords age. Well i was pleasantly suprised to be proven wrong. First off i'm a bit of a computer guru so i notice things about when computers are being used in movies, for instance why in every film when someone inserts a CD-ROM its up the instant they close the tray? Also one scene when Ford is hurrying to burn some information, like 10,000 of the riched accounts in the bank it burns the disc in about 10 seconds, wow now thats fast(laughs). Next no matter WHERE anyone drives, whether it be Ford of the criminals who kidnapp his family go or drive to, there is ALWAYS an internet connection for there laptops, even while moving...HA, ok who offers that service? These r just some basic little techy things, so no biggie. Now to the plot, which is very basic, the run of the mill bad guy ""if you don't do as we say by this time, your family dies, understand?"" films, however in saying this they do give it an interesting twist by using some very ""convincing"" well rounded actors to play these hardened criminals. So all in all why do i say this is such a good movie with all the cons? Well mainly its because of Fords steller preformance, that he hasn't given since the likes of The Fugitive, Patriot Games and Airforce One. And by the end of the movie Ford finds himself face to face with the evil mastermind he has been helping throughout the film(cliche) but still convincing. I was pleased to see a 63 or so old Harrison doing his own stunts(hell Steven Seagal in about 10 years younger and can't even climb over a fence in any of his new films), and by god they were some pretty intense stunts a lot of people my age(30) might not even have considered. Punching, running, kicking, falling through boards on a saw horse, bein repeatedly knocked down and shoved against the wall, kicked, grabbed by the neck, a good jump through the window scene and also a very harsh shoved OUT the window scene in which you can clearly see that its Ford. So yes i was extremely impressed with his overall performance in this film, a very realistic and convincing role. This also gave me great hope for the next Indiana Jones, now being filmed for 2007 release:) So while it may not be oscar worthy its certainly a very enjoyable watch worthy film, with some intense moments.",4,Harrison Ford proves he's still got it to go:),1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,2560,"['first', 'renting', 'Firewall', 'i', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'mainly', 'Ford', 'hasnt', 'had', 'worth', 'film', 'come', 'out', 'almost', '5', 'years', 'i', 'wasnt', 'sure', 'whole', 'storyline', 'Also', 'i', 'had', 'almost', 'snicker', 'when', 'i', 'found', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'Indiana', 'Jones', '2007', 'mainly', 'Fords', 'age', 'Well', 'i', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'suprised', 'be', 'proven', 'wrong', 'First', 'i', ""'m"", 'bit', 'computer', 'guru', 'i', 'notice', 'things', 'when', 'computers', 'are', 'being', 'used', 'movies', 'instance', 'why', 'film', 'when', 'someone', 'CD-ROM', 'up', 'instant', 'close', 'tray', 'Also', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'Ford', 'hurrying', 'burn', 'information', '10,000', 'riched', 'accounts', 'bank', 'disc', 'about', '10', 'seconds', 'wow', 'now', 'fast', 'laughs', 'Next', 'matter', 'WHERE', 'anyone', 'drives', 'be', 'Ford', 'criminals', 'who', 'kidnapp', 'family', 'go', 'drive', 'ALWAYS', 'internet', 'connection', 'laptops', 'even', 'moving', 'HA', 'ok', 'who', 'service', 'r', 'just', 'basic', 'little', 'techy', 'things', 'so', 'biggie', 'Now', 'plot', 'very', 'basic', 'run', 'mill', 'bad', 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'say', 'time', 'family', 'dies', 'understand', 'films', 'however', 'saying', 'do', 'give', 'interesting', 'twist', 'using', 'very', 'convincing', 'well', 'rounded', 'actors', 'play', 'hardened', 'criminals', 'So', 'all', 'why', 'do', 'i', 'say', 'such', 'good', 'movie', 'cons', 'Well', 'mainly', 'Fords', 'steller', 'preformance', ""n't"", 'given', 'likes', 'Fugitive', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'Airforce', 'One', 'end', 'movie', 'Ford', 'face', 'face', 'evil', 'mastermind', 'been', 'helping', 'film', 'cliche', 'still', 'convincing', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', '63', 'so', 'old', 'Harrison', 'doing', 'own', 'stunts', 'hell', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'about', '10', 'years', 'younger', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'climb', 'over', 'fence', 'new', 'films', 'god', 'were', 'pretty', 'intense', 'lot', 'people', 'age', '30', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'considered', 'Punching', 'running', 'kicking', 'falling', 'boards', 'saw', 'horse', 'bein', 'repeatedly', 'knocked', 'down', 'shoved', 'wall', 'kicked', 'grabbed', 'neck', 'good', 'jump', 'window', 'scene', 'also', 'very', 'harsh', 'shoved', 'OUT', 'window', 'scene', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'Ford', 'yes', 'i', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'overall', 'performance', 'film', 'very', 'realistic', 'convincing', 'role', 'also', 'gave', 'great', 'hope', 'next', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'now', 'being', 'filmed', '2007', 'release', 'So', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'certainly', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'worthy', 'film', 'intense', 'moments']",N/A

With the way the world is you never know when your very identity can be stolen from you, often times without you even knowing that it's occurring.  In the Warner Brothers thriller ""Firewall"" Harrison Ford discovers that security is not absolute no matter how hard you work to ensure it.""Firewall"" places us into the life of Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford), the head of I.T. (Information Technology) for Landrock Pacific Bank.  His day begins like any other, his wife Beth (Virginia Madsen) shares playful banter with him, and his kids bicker as usual, not a thing out of the ordinary.  As he goes throughout his day at the bank he tops things off with a meeting over drinks with a co-worker and a high-ranking employee of another bank.  After drinks are over, Jack leaves to go home when the very high-ranking employee of the other bank (Paul Bettany) appears in his backseat with startling news, Jack's family is being held hostage!  With his family in jeopardy Jack is forced to comply with the hostage-takers demands, he must steal 100 million dollars from the very bank he works for.  The criminals have anticipated virtually every scenario that could possibly occur during their heist; except one, what a desperate man will do to protect those he loves no matter the cost.When I first saw the previews for this thriller, my first thoughts were that the movie looked good and would probably be a movie I would thoroughly enjoy; however, I thought it appeared that Harrison Ford was basically doing the same character he had portrayed in ""Air Force One"" (minus the whole being President of the United States thing).  Now, many actors have made a career of playing virtually the same character that had brought them success in previous films, Tommy Lee Jones, Steven Seagal (though he's hardly successful anymore), Ben Stiller, and Jackie Chan.  In most of those instances each of those actors' movies are successful, except for Seagal's of course.  So, even though I thought that Harrison was doing the same character again, I still was excited to see this movie.  After watching this movie I have to say, that even though Harrison is playing the same type of character that he's known for, basically the average guy who is vulnerable, yet full of strength and resourcefulness, he still delivers an excellent performance that you can't help but enjoy.  The supporting cast led by Paul Bettany (""A Knight's Tale"") and Virginia Madsen (""Sideways"") are equally strong, especially Bettany who delivers a much more realistic villain than he did in his previous bad guy role in the lackluster ""The Da Vinci Code"".The story was very well paced, full of plenty of action and thrills that keep the audience riveted throughout the entire duration.  The director made a choice that can sometimes harm a movie's success, by pushing the movie into high gear early on.  But director Richard Loncraine (""Wimbledon"") managed to get the audience to connect to the characters during the opening scene of the movie, and gradually fleshed out the characters over the entire course of the film, which gave the movie much more story than your average action thrill-ride generally contains.  The topic of identity theft is one that is very real in today's world, and ""Firewall"" treats the subject in a very serious manner, taking careful consideration to never make light of the very serious issue, and keeping that aspect of the movie as realistic to the general public as possible.""Firewall"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",5,Protect Your Identity...,1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,3693,"['today', 'world', 'one', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'careful', 'identity', 'be', 'bank', 'account', 'information', 'social', 'security', 'numbers', 'credit', 'cards', 'anything', 'matter', 'way', 'world', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'very', 'identity', 'can', 'be', 'stolen', 'often', 'even', 'knowing', 'occurring', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'thriller', 'Firewall', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'security', 'not', 'absolute', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'work', 'ensure', 'Firewall', 'life', 'Jack', 'Stanfield', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'head', 'I.T', 'Information', 'Technology', 'Landrock', 'Pacific', 'Bank', 'day', 'other', 'wife', 'Beth', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'shares', 'playful', 'banter', 'kids', 'bicker', 'usual', 'not', 'thing', 'ordinary', 'day', 'bank', 'things', 'off', 'meeting', 'drinks', 'co-worker', 'high-ranking', 'employee', 'bank', 'drinks', 'are', 'Jack', 'go', 'home', 'when', 'very', 'high-ranking', 'employee', 'other', 'bank', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'backseat', 'startling', 'news', 'Jack', 'family', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'family', 'jeopardy', 'Jack', 'forced', 'comply', 'hostage-takers', 'demands', 'must', 'steal', '100', 'million', 'dollars', 'very', 'bank', 'criminals', 'have', 'anticipated', 'virtually', 'scenario', 'could', 'possibly', 'occur', 'heist', 'one', 'what', 'desperate', 'man', 'will', 'do', 'protect', 'matter', 'cost.When', 'first', 'saw', 'previews', 'thriller', 'first', 'thoughts', 'were', 'movie', 'looked', 'good', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'movie', 'would', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'however', 'thought', 'appeared', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'was', 'basically', 'doing', 'same', 'character', 'had', 'portrayed', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'whole', 'being', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'thing', 'Now', 'many', 'actors', 'have', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'virtually', 'same', 'character', 'had', 'brought', 'success', 'previous', 'films', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'hardly', 'successful', 'anymore', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'most', 'instances', 'actors', 'movies', 'are', 'successful', 'Seagal', 'course', 'So', 'even', 'thought', 'Harrison', 'was', 'doing', 'same', 'character', 'again', 'still', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'watching', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'even', 'Harrison', 'playing', 'same', 'type', 'character', 'known', 'basically', 'average', 'guy', 'who', 'vulnerable', 'full', 'strength', 'resourcefulness', 'still', 'excellent', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'supporting', 'cast', 'led', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Sideways', 'are', 'equally', 'strong', 'especially', 'Bettany', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'villain', 'did', 'previous', 'bad', 'guy', 'role', 'lackluster', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', '.The', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'paced', 'full', 'plenty', 'action', 'thrills', 'keep', 'audience', 'riveted', 'entire', 'duration', 'director', 'made', 'choice', 'can', 'sometimes', 'harm', 'movie', 'success', 'pushing', 'movie', 'high', 'gear', 'early', 'director', 'Richard', 'Loncraine', 'Wimbledon', 'managed', 'get', 'audience', 'connect', 'characters', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'gradually', 'fleshed', 'out', 'characters', 'entire', 'course', 'film', 'gave', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'average', 'action', 'thrill-ride', 'generally', 'topic', 'identity', 'theft', 'one', 'very', 'real', 'today', 'world', 'Firewall', 'subject', 'very', 'serious', 'manner', 'taking', 'careful', 'consideration', 'never', 'make', 'light', 'very', 'serious', 'issue', 'keeping', 'aspect', 'movie', 'realistic', 'general', 'public', 'possible', 'Firewall', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'language']",N/A

You have Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford) as a loving husband and father of two. Stanfield is the expert that designed the computer systems for the bank he works at, maybe it was just me but it took a while for them to tell you that he worked in a bank. So about 20 minutes into the movie the Stanfields home is invaded by men with guns and his entire life is turned around but you still don't know what the heck they want. Finally after a bunch of talk you find out that the men want Jack to help them break into the computer system he built and wire a load of cash into various accounts.Of course there have been plenty of movies that are just like this one with so now all this film could hope for is that the cast gives a great performance. The acting is mixed up, those criminals that broke into the Stanfields home who are supposed to be relentless are far from it and that sets the movie back. These guys were getting beaten up and outsmarted by a couple of kids the entire time. Plus the guy from Wimbledon is leading them; the kids were pushing him around like it was nothing.

In this case, Ford's character is Jack Stanfield, a bank security specialist whose family is held hostage by a group of bank robbers. The robbers want Jack to help them steal millions of dollars from the bank by cracking into the network's security system.The premise of the film is interesting, but the first two-thirds of the movie really drag. The thing that bothers me the most about the film is that so much of the drama is underplayed. When the robbers break into the Stanfield house, Jack's wife, Beth (Virginia Madsen), is completely freaked out at first, but less than 15 minutes later, she's calmly making breakfast with everyone and chit-chatting with her kidnappers around the kitchen table. Similarly, little Andy (Jimmy Bennett) has no qualms about laughing and making pancakes with his captor the morning after the break-in. Is that normal behavior fom a six-year-old boy? I don't think so. I think the underplaying was a conscious choice on the part of the screenwriter and the director, and it was a poor one.Eventually, the film picks up the pace during the last 40 minutes or so. Ford does some impressive stunts and has some amusing scenes with Janet, his administrative assistant (Mary Lynn Rajskub), but that's about it. ""Firewall"" is disappointingly dull and predictable.

The characters for the most part are flat, the twists are unbelievable, and everything in the story lacks any reality. The incredibly high tech bank is run on a rack of pc equipment, but somehow is now run remotely and all of the maintenance terminals are missing. As if the full rack of gear needs some green screens in order to work. Sorry. Then of course the hackers need to do a home invasion in order to get physical access to the system. Hmm. And then they take several days, only to stumble when the maintenance terminals are missing. So, in a flash of brilliance Harrison Ford rips out the scanning bar from an all in one printer and plugs it into an ipod. And then tapes it to the screen so that they can capture the screen output.

Harrison Ford plays a security expert forced to break his unbreakable security system as a smarmy criminal (Paul Bettany) holds his wife (Virginia Madsen) and kids hostage.  It's familiar territory for Ford, but he plays it well like he usually does, while Bettany provides for a decent villain.  And that's just about all the good that Firewall does.  The film is a strictly by the numbers thriller that doesn't deliver on the thrills and opts instead for a safer route.

He has a wife (Virginia Madsen), two kids, nice house.... you get the idea.  In comes the villian (Paul Bettany) and his band of thugs to try to use Ford to rob the bank.  Pretty simple, huh?  No, not in the least...The story is a great one in that it is smart, well-paced, and truly suspenseful.  I was on the edge of my seat for nearly the entirety of the film.  Also, you really can't predict where this one is headed at times, which is such a great achievement in a thriller today.But what really makes this movie is the acting.  Harrison Ford's return to the silver screen is a triumphant one.  He delivers a fantastic performance of an innocent man wronged.  Sound familiar?  Yeah, but who cares?  This is HARRISON FORD, folks!  He's arguably the greatest action hero in cinema history and one of the best actors of all time.  So what if he's already brilliantly played similar parts in ""The Fugitive,"" ""Air Force One,"" and ""Clear and Present Danger?""  The point is that they're only similar parts.  Ford's character in Firewall is different from all of those, but different in such subtle ways that he still creates such an inspiring, believable hero that we all can root for.  This is really such a testament to what a great actor Harrison Ford really is.With every great hero, you need a great villian.  Paul Bettany gives us just that.  He creates a villian with such depth, but yet still so sinister.  I don't think I've ever hated a character in any film more than I hated Bettany's in Firewall.  He's an up and coming star and such a great talent.  We'll definitely be seeing more of him in the near future....Altogether, Firewall is a fresh, well-crafted film that offers two hours of solid entertainment.  I'm not sure what film some of the critics went to see, but the Firewall I saw was a darn fine film and one I'm looking forward to seeing again.",5,"Smart, engaging edge-of-your-seat thriller",1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,1950,"['open', 'Jack', 'Stanfield', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'big', 'bank', 'software', 'security', 'expert', 'wife', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'two', 'kids', 'nice', 'house', 'get', 'idea', 'villian', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'band', 'thugs', 'try', 'use', 'Ford', 'rob', 'bank', 'Pretty', 'simple', 'huh', 'No', 'not', 'least', 'story', 'great', 'one', 'smart', 'well-paced', 'truly', 'suspenseful', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'nearly', 'entirety', 'film', 'Also', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'predict', 'where', 'one', 'headed', 'times', 'such', 'great', 'achievement', 'thriller', 'today.But', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'acting', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'return', 'silver', 'screen', 'triumphant', 'one', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'innocent', 'man', 'wronged', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Yeah', 'who', 'HARRISON', 'FORD', 'folks', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'action', 'hero', 'cinema', 'history', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'time', 'So', 'what', 'already', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'similar', 'parts', 'Fugitive', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'point', ""'re"", 'only', 'similar', 'parts', 'Ford', 'character', 'Firewall', 'different', 'different', 'such', 'subtle', 'ways', 'still', 'such', 'inspiring', 'believable', 'hero', 'can', 'root', 'really', 'such', 'testament', 'what', 'great', 'actor', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'really', 'is.With', 'great', 'hero', 'need', 'great', 'villian', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'just', 'villian', 'such', 'depth', 'yet', 'still', 'so', 'sinister', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'hated', 'character', 'film', 'more', 'hated', 'Bettany', 'Firewall', 'up', 'coming', 'star', 'such', 'great', 'talent', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'be', 'seeing', 'more', 'near', 'future', '.Altogether', 'Firewall', 'fresh', 'well-crafted', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'solid', 'entertainment', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'film', 'critics', 'went', 'see', 'Firewall', 'saw', 'was', 'darn', 'fine', 'film', 'one', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again']",N/A

Back that up with Virginia Madsen as his wife and Paul Bettany as the nasty, sociopathic bad guy with an improbable three-man screwup team and you have quite a mix.Ford plays Jack Stanfield, vice president of security at a large Seattle Bank that has just finished installing a new security system that Jack doesn't seem thrilled with. Enter the bad guy, who forgot to complete his homework and didn't know about the upgraded system, but kidnaps Jack's wife, teenage daughter, and asthmatic/peanut allergic son, in the hope of scamming $100 million from the bank. He wants Jack to log into the system, obtain the 10,000 highest depositors, and transfer $10,000 each from their accounts into the robber's offshore account. Things go awry because of the security upgrade and Jack has to come up with some unbelievable (and if you know anything about technology--impossible) jury-rigging to accomplish the deed. The film switches back and forth between scenarios. The bad guys at Jack's house treat Jack's family nice one moment and feed the son a cookie with peanuts to induce anaphylactic shock the next--to Jack, constantly under surveillance, trying to figure out how to foil the robbers and getting the crap beat out of himself, then succumbing to carrying out their demands to save his family. And to top it off, in the end everything is going to point back to Jack, who's supposed to end up dead, as having been the mastermind behind the theft.Great acting, action and tension--however, the plot is too weak and implausible.

It doesn't exactly INSULT the intelligence of the audience...but for the most part, it doesn't exactly require a careful following of the plot twists either.But it's a Harrison Ford film, and there was a time when that alone was cause of celebration.  However, it's been a long time since there was a good Ford movie, and FIREWALL ain't it either.  Even in some of his poorer films of the past though, he was at least entertaining to watch.  Thinking back on HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE, which was a real mess of a film...constant changes in tone, loose pacing, Josh Harnett...Ford at least was amusing and his charisma helped a lot.  We brought our own good feelings about him to the film.  In FIREWALL, it's tough to like him.  Ford himself seems tired and disinterested...he's going through the motions.  And if we don't care about him, it's hard to care about his hastily sketched family either.  And if we don't care about them...well, it's just hard to care much about the film.There are some bright spots to keep this from being a totally forgettable film.  Paul Bettany makes a nice villain overall.  The character is written in very generic fashion, but Bettany, who is normally SO likeable (WIMBLEDON, MASTER AND COMMANDER) makes his intelligent bad-guy neatly creepy.  Sadly, during the final scenes of the film, all pretense that this guy is cool-as-a-cumcumber go right out the window and he becomes totally generic.  Not Bettany's fault...the script essentially abandons him.Also, Mary Lynn Rajskub essentially reprises her role from TV's ""24,"" but it's such a fun character that she's very welcome in FIREWALL.The always wonderful Alan Arkin, as well as Robert Patrick and Robert Forster are all pretty much wasted in very generic roles.  They add a little class to the movie, but it's just a sheen that brings no extra substance.  Virginia Madsen is also a very welcome presence, but the part of ""the wife"" will hardly be in her list of most memorable roles.The action sequences are tame.  It's mostly one of those movies where things are one close call after another.  For awhile, Ford is simply trying to let someone know he's in trouble without the bad-guys knowing he's telling anyone, and those moments offer the most fun of the film.  They are small-scale and believable...we can almost feel him thinking of what to do next...refusing to believe he's been outsmarted.  Later, when the plot thickens, it becomes more unbelievable and losing its tenuous grounding in reality.So, I will continue my wait for a Harrison Ford movie worth seeing...you should wait too, rather than seeing FIREWALL.",3,A movie done by rote,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,2722,"['really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'original', 'surprising', 'entire', 'movie', 'numbers', 'rote', 'suspense', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'intelligence', 'audience', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'require', 'careful', 'following', 'plot', 'twists', 'either.But', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'film', 'there', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'alone', 'was', 'cause', 'celebration', 'However', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'good', 'Ford', 'movie', 'FIREWALL', 'ai', ""n't"", 'either', 'Even', 'poorer', 'films', 'past', 'though', 'was', 'least', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Thinking', 'back', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'HOMICIDE', 'was', 'real', 'mess', 'film', 'constant', 'changes', 'tone', 'loose', 'pacing', 'Josh', 'Harnett', 'Ford', 'least', 'was', 'amusing', 'charisma', 'helped', 'lot', 'brought', 'own', 'good', 'feelings', 'film', 'FIREWALL', 'tough', 'like', 'Ford', 'tired', 'disinterested', 'going', 'motions', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'hard', 'care', 'hastily', 'sketched', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'well', 'just', 'hard', 'care', 'much', 'film.There', 'are', 'bright', 'spots', 'keep', 'being', 'totally', 'forgettable', 'film', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'nice', 'villain', 'overall', 'character', 'written', 'very', 'generic', 'fashion', 'Bettany', 'who', 'normally', 'SO', 'likeable', 'WIMBLEDON', 'MASTER', 'AND', 'COMMANDER', 'intelligent', 'bad-guy', 'neatly', 'Sadly', 'final', 'scenes', 'film', 'pretense', 'guy', 'cool-as-a-cumcumber', 'go', 'right', 'out', 'window', 'totally', 'generic', 'Not', 'Bettany', 'fault', 'script', 'essentially', 'abandons', 'him.Also', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'essentially', 'role', 'TV', '24', 'such', 'fun', 'character', 'very', 'welcome', 'FIREWALL.The', 'always', 'wonderful', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'as', 'well', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'wasted', 'very', 'generic', 'roles', 'add', 'little', 'class', 'movie', 'just', 'sheen', 'extra', 'substance', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'also', 'very', 'welcome', 'presence', 'part', 'wife', 'will', 'hardly', 'be', 'list', 'most', 'memorable', 'roles.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'tame', 'mostly', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'one', 'close', 'call', 'awhile', 'Ford', 'simply', 'trying', 'let', 'someone', 'know', 'trouble', 'bad-guys', 'knowing', 'telling', 'anyone', 'moments', 'offer', 'most', 'fun', 'film', 'are', 'small-scale', 'believable', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'thinking', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'refusing', 'believe', 'been', 'outsmarted', 'Later', 'when', 'plot', 'thickens', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'losing', 'tenuous', 'grounding', 'reality.So', 'will', 'continue', 'wait', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'should', 'wait', 'too', 'rather', 'seeing', 'FIREWALL']",N/A

This is the umpteenth version of that old chestnut about a bank executive whose family is held hostage while he is forced to assist the kidnappers in robbing the bank.  However, as this is the 21st Century, the  modus operandi of these criminals involves not guns and masks but coded passwords and computerized money transfers.  One would have to be the biggest computer geek going to understand even half of what the characters are doing at any given time in this film, though it scarcely matters since the story itself is so distressingly hackneyed that one is already watching the screen with an eye half-cocked to one's watch anyway.Poor Harrison Ford, looking like he hasn`t slept in days (and this is BEFORE his family is kidnapped), seems to sense that he is indeed at the nadir of his career and thus turns in a performance that is so lacking in energy and interest that he seems more bored with the material than we are.  Paul Bettany has some effective moments as the smarmy criminal ringleader, but none of the other actors is given even a fighting chance with this wretched excuse for a screenplay.

I couldn't in good conscience give it 4 stars though as I reserve that for movies which are almost classic.  I rented Firewall without knowing much about it besides that I generally like Harrison Ford as an actor and a person (besides some recent lifestyle decisions, I actually think he's a decent respectable guy compared to many of the emerging faces in Hollywood...)  I haven't seen many of his films I haven't liked, besides Hollywood Homicide and K-19 Widowmaker (I actually semi-enjoyed 6 Days 7 Nights) and hadn't heard much about this one and I wanted to watch something I hadn't seen yet, so my wife and I rented it. We were both pleasantly surprised by this movie.  It is an example of a good thriller.  It lacked any type of sexuality, didn't have extreme violence, and had just a little bad language (there is an F word).  This is refreshing considering how crude so many movies are today.  The pacing of the movie was great.  It started out quickly and was tense throughout.  Unlike many movies, you actually cared about the characters and their fates and you actually hated the bad guy (played very well by Paul Bettany).  The ending was abrupt and I would have liked to have seen a little bit more of a wind-down, showing the characters in the aftermath of a traumatic event, but the ending was pretty typical for this type of movie.  All in all, Firewall doesn't tread much new ground, it isn't going to win an award, and it probably won't be remembered much 10 years from now, but it is a good Harrison Ford film, it is good entertainment, it is exciting, and worth at least a rental.

Kind of like showing up for class and getting a C minus (or D plus).  But I'd love to go ahead and pull the trigger and give Firewall one star, just for the pure cynical calculation behind the making of the movie. Firewall is yet another PG-13 movie, playing it safe, staying within the bounds of whatever Hollywood deems as ""conventional"" thriller (which now includes food allergies for the kids).  Harrison Ford, as Jack Stanfield (strong name alert), wheezes his way through the connect-a-dots plot, while Virginia Madsen, as Stanfield's wife, looks glad for the paycheck, but that's about it.  She's supposed to be carrying on an affair with one of Stanfield's associates - which is tacked on as an afterthought.  Heavens!  Being a super soccer mon (and architect!), when would she have the time? Yes, ladies, in a PG-13 world, you can still have it all.  That said however, Madsen at least seems to have a pulse as she mother-hens the kids and the family dog through the danger.

Moreover, this film pits alleged intelligence (of the protagonist) against intelligence (of the antagonist), but in the end, it's the good guy who wins because he's good (his moral drive to save his family trumps the greed - a heart issue, not a mind issue - of the bad guy). So this film is really about good versus evil, not intellect versus intellect. But who want to watch the latter?

Everything else has been bad, REAL BAD.  Hollywood Homicide, Six Days Seven Nights, Random Hearts (made in 1999 but it was so poor I am counting it), K-19: The Widowmaker and now Firewall.  I am not going to rant about this movie for too long.  Mainly, because it isn't worth my time.  I can't believe that there were so many named actors in this movie and it was so poor.  Firewall featured Alan Arkin, Robert Forster, Robert Patrick, Virginia Madsen and of course Harrison Ford.  I did find it quite interesting that Mary Lynn Rajskub was in this movie.  Perhaps you are wondering who Mary Lynn is.  She plays the insipid but droll computer geek Chloe on 24.  I thought it was kind of cool to see her in this movie.  However she is still walking around saying, ""Jack"", which is Harrison's name in this movie as well as Kiefer's in 24.This movie is very much an equation for any general thriller, just plug in Harrison Ford and company.  In other words, this movie isn't original and has been made a dozen times before.  Harry Ford really comes off old and clumsily in this movie.

Harrison, sorry, Jack must do whatever they want in order to protect his family and what they want is for Jack, er... Harrison, uh, Jack, to help them past the computer safeguards at the bank Jack has just spent 20 years constructing. Now he has to help the bad guys rob the bank and they want to steal a lot of money.So begins ""Firewall"", the new thriller starring Harrison Ford, Paul Bettany and Virginia Madsen. After years of subjecting us to romantic comedies and dramas, tepid at best, awful at worst, it is nice to see Ford returning to the genre he does so well. Yes, the film uses cookie cutter elements from many of his previous films (and many of Michael Douglas' previous films, for that matter) but it is still a welcome step in the right direction.Ford plays Jack Stanfield, the man in charge of computer operations at a mid-size bank in the Pacific Northwest. A merger has just been completed and they now have more branches, more assets and Jack doesn't get along with the larger bank's liaison (Robert Patrick). Jack is one of those movie heroes who cares about two things; his family and his job. This is one of those movies in which the hero will have the two things he cares most about threatened; his family and his job. He will ultimately have to figure out how to save his family while doing minimum damage to the institution that has employed him for the last twenty years. And from all indications, paid him well.In films like this, everything is about the hero and the villain; everyone else is pure window dressing. Paul Bettany makes an interesting villain. Cool and collected, he never loses his calm, rarely shouts, yet seems entirely menacing. His plan seems good, convincing, and very thorough, until he runs into an obstacle. Virginia Madsen is good as Jack's wife, but the role is pretty generic. Basically, any actress could play the role. This is a rather sad statement. Is this really the best role Virginia Madsen could find? She is closer to Ford's age than many of his previous film partners have been, but is still a good two decades younger, but it is better than the usual three or four. The implausible bit of the family dynamic comes with the introduction of their two children. Okay, I can maybe believe Ford, who is in his early sixties, might have a 14 year old daughter, but an 8 year old son? This stretches things a bit too much. In Matthew McConnaughey's new film ""Failure to Launch"", Kathy Bates, who is 56, plays McConnaughey's mom, and he is in his early 30s.The plan to rob the bank seems well constructed and it is interesting to watch both Jack and Bill Cox (Bettany's character) work through the various elements of their respective plans. At some point, naturally, Jack will attempt to turn the tide, and it is at this point that the film becomes more interesting. As we watch Cox's plan, and then Jack's start to unfold, the mechanics of these schemes hold our interest, involving us. It is more interesting to watch Jack unravel the intricacies of his scenario, because it is new and not necessarily as well thought out. Bill's plan is calculated and interesting, but he knows every detail of it. We learn the details because he is letting Jack in on a particular aspect. It is still fun, but watching Jack hatch a plan as we watch is like letting us in on the secret. It also allows us to root for the hero. As he hatches a way to get the upper hand, we feel included in this operation and we want Jack to win the day.The film is more a suspense film than action. Ford is getting older, so the filmmakers have, thankfully, confined the action to a segment during the finale. It seems more natural this way. If he were always getting into fist fights or car chases, we would begin to question where the character, a security person at a bank, received this training.""Firewall"" is a long way from the Harrison Ford films we all love; a ludicrous plot twist late in the film and one of the most obnoxious images I have seen in film in a long time don't leave us with a favorable impression.

That broad description covers the basic storyline of Firewall (2006), where Ford plays Jack Stanfield, the head of security for a financial institution, who is forced to help a gang of criminals rob his firm, in order to save his family.A group of men led by Bill Cox (Paul Bettany) invade Stanfield's Seattle home, and take his wife Beth (Virginia Madsen), daughter Sarah (Carly Schroeder), and son Andy (Jimmy Bennett) hostage.  Forced to wear a camera and earpiece, Jack's movements are transmitted back to gang.  Cox appears at the bank impersonating an agent of a government agency, but there is a problem with his plan to access the funds, until Stanfield finds a way to make it happen.Mary Lynn Rajskub, probably best known for playing Chloe O'Brian on 24, is Stanfield's secretary Janet Stone.  Stanfield is forced by Cox to fire her, but when the chips are down, he turns to her for help.  There's a bit of the flavor of 24, as Janet provides vital aid to another `Jack'.  Veteran actors Robert Forrester, Robert Patrick, and Alan Arkin, are familiar faces in supporting roles.  Although attempts are made to illustrate his ruthless side, and Cox is quite nasty at times, he mostly attacks the weak and helpless.  The role of Stanfield is nothing new for Ford, and he carries it off fairly well, for a guy that was 64 at the time.  He may be pushing seventy, but Ford still has a passion for action films.  After completing Firewall, his next project would be Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), a film that as a physical challenge, makes Firewall look like a jog in the park.Firewall is an unoriginal, mildly effective thriller.  The villains are amateurish, and not terribly bright.  You may not really believe that the Stanfield family could really be hurt, but there are some tense moments, before the action ramps up at the end.  As usual, Harrison Ford's performance, does keep things interesting.  The DVD has a couple of short bonus features which feature Ford, director Richard Loncraine, and writer Joe Forte.",3,"another Jack, on a desperate mission. . .",1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,2293,"['icon', 'action/adventure', 'genre', 'characters', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'often', 'are', 'passive', 'quiet', 'types', 'explode', 'action', 'only', 'when', 'provoked', 'then', 'follow', 'relentlessly', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'may', 'be', 'broad', 'description', 'basic', 'storyline', 'Firewall', '2006', 'where', 'Ford', 'Jack', 'Stanfield', 'head', 'security', 'financial', 'institution', 'who', 'forced', 'help', 'gang', 'criminals', 'rob', 'firm', 'order', 'save', 'family.A', 'group', 'men', 'led', 'Bill', 'Cox', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'invade', 'Stanfield', 'Seattle', 'home', 'take', 'wife', 'Beth', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'Carly', 'Schroeder', 'son', 'Andy', 'Jimmy', 'Bennett', 'hostage', 'Forced', 'wear', 'camera', 'earpiece', 'Jack', 'movements', 'are', 'transmitted', 'back', 'gang', 'Cox', 'bank', 'impersonating', 'agent', 'government', 'agency', 'problem', 'plan', 'access', 'funds', 'Stanfield', 'way', 'make', 'happen.Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'Chloe', ""O'Brian"", '24', 'Stanfield', 'secretary', 'Janet', 'Stone', 'Stanfield', 'forced', 'Cox', 'fire', 'when', 'chips', 'are', 'down', 'help', 'bit', 'flavor', '24', 'Janet', 'vital', 'aid', 'Jack', 'Veteran', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Forrester', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'are', 'familiar', 'supporting', 'roles', 'attempts', 'are', 'made', 'illustrate', 'ruthless', 'side', 'Cox', 'quite', 'nasty', 'times', 'mostly', 'weak', 'helpless', 'role', 'Stanfield', 'nothing', 'new', 'Ford', 'off', 'fairly', 'well', 'guy', 'was', '64', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'pushing', 'seventy', 'Ford', 'still', 'passion', 'action', 'films', 'completing', 'Firewall', 'next', 'project', 'would', 'be', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Kingdom', 'Crystal', 'Skull', '2008', 'film', 'physical', 'challenge', 'Firewall', 'look', 'jog', 'park.Firewall', 'unoriginal', 'mildly', 'effective', 'thriller', 'villains', 'are', 'amateurish', 'not', 'terribly', 'bright', 'may', 'not', 'really', 'believe', 'Stanfield', 'family', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'hurt', 'are', 'tense', 'moments', 'action', 'up', 'end', 'usual', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'performance', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'couple', 'short', 'bonus', 'features', 'feature', 'Ford', 'director', 'Richard', 'Loncraine', 'writer', 'Joe', 'Forte']",N/A
985411,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000F8DV1M,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 11]","Let's face it. Harrison Ford needs `Indiana Jones' right now. I don't care if Han Solo is now 63 years ago. Good actor is always good, and age does not matter. However, it is not a little shocking to see Harrison Ford in `Firewall,' who gives least satisfying acting in his career. Probably I am not the only one who thought he is not commited to the project, and his acting, lifeless and dull, is far from his best.In `Firewall,' Harrison Ford plays Jack Stanfield, security specialist working for a bank. His wife (Virginia Madsen) and his two children, however, are taken hostage and terrorized by a villain one Bill Cox (Paul Bettany sporting distinct British accent), who orders Jack to do what he says, Of course Bill wants the money, and does not come to Jack's house alone. He is with four armed baddies, all non-descript guys.[CLICH?-RIDDEN] This extreme situation has been used with some variations added to it (as in `Don't Say a Word') and though it ceased to be fresh long time ago, it could be still thrilling with clever twists. But `Firewall' misses all the chances, relying on a number of clich?s. Instead of writing about the predictable plans of Bill Cox, let's see a check list prepared for you: An ordinary American male with beautiful and understanding wife [check]; his daughter with I-Pod [check]; his son [check]; the son's disease [check]; a dog [check]; one villainous male with British accent [check]; four henchmen foolish enough to follow the ruthless leader without worrying about their own demise [check]; computer jargons and one laptop, two cell phones, and last-minute escape [check]. It goes on and on.Perhaps these familiar ideas might be tolerable if Harrison Ford had done a better job. Sorry, but he is not only miscast, but his vapid performance undermines all the efforts of the supporting actors, and the film lacks in both life-or-death thrills and emotional impact.I almost forgot to say that despite the title, the film's content has little to do with the computer security. `Firewall' shows you that the best defense against the hackers and imposters is traditional fisticuffs. And don't forget a dog. Believe me or not, `Firewall' proves that keeping a dog would be very helpful in case you meet these bumbling baddies in person.",2,Routine Thriller with Ford's Least Satisfying Performance,1144281600,"04 6, 2006",2006,2277,"['Let', 'face', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'right', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Han', 'Solo', 'now', '63', 'years', 'ago', 'Good', 'actor', 'always', 'good', 'age', 'not', 'matter', 'However', 'not', 'little', 'shocking', 'see', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Firewall', 'who', 'least', 'satisfying', 'acting', 'career', 'Probably', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'thought', 'not', 'commited', 'project', 'acting', 'lifeless', 'dull', 'far', 'best.In', 'Firewall', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Jack', 'Stanfield', 'security', 'specialist', 'working', 'bank', 'wife', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'two', 'children', 'however', 'are', 'taken', 'hostage', 'terrorized', 'villain', 'one', 'Bill', 'Cox', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'sporting', 'distinct', 'British', 'accent', 'who', 'orders', 'Jack', 'do', 'what', 'course', 'Bill', 'money', 'not', 'come', 'Jack', 'house', 'alone', 'four', 'armed', 'baddies', 'non-descript', 'guys', '[', 'CLICH', '-RIDDEN', ']', 'extreme', 'situation', 'been', 'used', 'variations', 'added', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Say', 'Word', 'ceased', 'be', 'fresh', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'could', 'be', 'still', 'thrilling', 'clever', 'twists', 'Firewall', 'misses', 'chances', 'relying', 'number', 'clich', 's', 'Instead', 'writing', 'predictable', 'plans', 'Bill', 'Cox', 'let', 'see', 'check', 'list', 'prepared', 'ordinary', 'American', 'male', 'beautiful', 'understanding', 'wife', '[', 'check', ']', 'daughter', 'I-Pod', '[', 'check', ']', 'son', '[', 'check', ']', 'son', 'disease', '[', 'check', ']', 'dog', '[', 'check', ']', 'one', 'villainous', 'male', 'British', 'accent', '[', 'check', ']', 'four', 'henchmen', 'foolish', 'enough', 'follow', 'ruthless', 'leader', 'worrying', 'own', 'demise', '[', 'check', ']', 'computer', 'jargons', 'one', 'laptop', 'two', 'cell', 'phones', 'last-minute', 'escape', '[', 'check', ']', 'familiar', 'ideas', 'might', 'be', 'tolerable', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'had', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'Sorry', 'not', 'only', 'miscast', 'vapid', 'performance', 'undermines', 'efforts', 'supporting', 'actors', 'film', 'life-or-death', 'thrills', 'emotional', 'impact.I', 'almost', 'forgot', 'say', 'title', 'film', 'content', 'little', 'do', 'computer', 'security', 'Firewall', 'shows', 'best', 'defense', 'hackers', 'imposters', 'traditional', 'fisticuffs', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'dog', 'Believe', 'not', 'Firewall', 'proves', 'keeping', 'dog', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'helpful', 'case', 'meet', 'bumbling', 'baddies', 'person']",N/A

They have a beautiful home designed by his wife.  He has a good job at a bank as VP of Security.  His bank has just merged with another bank and their whole computer system has been redone.Enter into this picture the head ""bad guy"", a sophisticated bank robber who wants Harrison Ford to skim $10,000 from each of the bank's top 10,000 wealthiest clients.  To force him to do this, the robbert's minions have stationed themselves at Jack's home capturing his wife and children and have setup cameras everywhere.  They also wire Jack for audio and video.  The head robber, Cox, is also smart enough to frame Jack for various other things leading his new boss and others to start becoming suspicious and make things dicey for him.I really enjoyed the intrigue and action.  I especially enjoyed how they didn't have Jack become a ""superhero"" but rather just a middle-aged man trying desparately to protect his family and find someone he could trust to help him.Being also an IT geek, I could see the flaws in the movie's computer scenes, etc. but that's okay.

There is no commentary by director or writer or producer but you probably won't want to see it if you sit through all the film.The film picks up at the end.  Maybe the middle 30 minutes could be deleted to make it more watcheable.How is it that the darling little boy is subjected to mistreatment through the film, but the wife and daughter character have some special status that prevents them from comparable threat?  Is it believeable that the wife and teenage daughter would sit around day after day in the house, captive with 4 or 5 men, and it would be the little boy who is the victim of mistreatment--""take him downstairs and break his knee,"" &c.;I took my daughter to karate twice a week for 5 years.  I taught her to shoot rifle, shotgun, revolver, and auto pistol.  If she were in this situation, she would do more than whine, stuff Trix in her mouth, and act helpless, like the 13-year old girl portrayed as the captive daughter.And how about that dog?  Would an annoying ugly yapping dog make it through the first evening, much less several days?Next, those dopey gun-to-the-head scenes.  OK I have never  had a gun to my head and hope I don't in the near term, but how is it than when a movie character has a gun to their head they just fall apart and do whatever is asked?

I've been a fan of his since ""Raiders,"" but I totally skipped such offerings as ""K-19: The Widowmaker"" and ""Hollywood Homicide,"" as did audiences.  Thus, I was somewhat excited when ""Firewall"" appeared to be a decent action flick; well, not excited enough to watch it until a year after its release, but at least I did eventually see it.  I got about what I expected - a completely average, predictable action movie.Ford plays Jack Stanfield, a security technician at a large bank; or at least I think that's what he was - these kinds of details were mostly glossed over.  A group of British thieves decides to kidnap Stanfield's family, including his lovely architect wife, Virginia Madsen, and two annoying kids.  The murky plan involves Stanfield transferring funds to them, although it's later revealed that a new security system makes such a transfer seemingly impossible.  The kidnappers, led by a perpetually sneering Paul Bettany, supposedly tracked this family for weeks ahead of time and knew every detail about this job; how could they have overlooked such a crucial detail?  Well, that's just the beginning of the holes in the plot line.  Toward the end of the movie, Ford has to explain to his secretary everything that has happened; the look of confusion on her face summed up how I felt as well.""Firewall"" advertised itself as a high-tech thriller, focusing on computer security systems.  However, the movie really drops the ball repeatedly on this angle.  Every time the high-tech elements get going, we cut to another lame fight scene or explosion.  I wish it had stuck more faithfully to the high-tech plot, particularly given how old Ford is starting to look during fight scenes.  ""Firewall"" makes me really hope that the upcoming Indiana Jones movie focuses on humor and not Ford puffing through action scenes.
