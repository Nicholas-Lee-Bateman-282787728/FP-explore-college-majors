1502474,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B005SHBO1Y,Brett Corkins,"[0, 0]","Kevin Hart is hilarious. Through and through, he is the funniest comedian working. Whether he's talking about ostriches running beside the car or his mom's unorthodox parenting, he has such a talent at making everything funny. Laugh At My Pain takes that to a new level.Laugh At My Pain is all about Kevin's life. Everything from his dad being a drug addict to his mother's funeral to his divorce, he doesn't hold anything back. But, this is more than just Kevin Hart doing stand up. This is about Kevin remembering where he came from, remembering situations and people that made him who he is today, and the first twenty or so minutes of the film is nothing but that, culminating in an emotional speech in front of all his family thanking them for always being there.I get that making stand up specials more like documentaries is popular now. Katt Williams has been doing that for a while now. But Kevin Hart's Laugh At My Pain is so much more. Yes, the intro is him walking us through Philadelphia, his old stomping grounds and a family supper. Yes, there is a stand up special. But, after the special there's another 30 minute show(?) that depicts Kevin's own spin on the classic movie Resevoir Dogs. This is so unbelievably funny and unexpected that it earns the price of admission alone. Without giving too much away, it centers around Kevin and his friends (un)successfully robbing a bank.Laugh At My Pain is a touching, hilarious show that sheds a bit more light on Kevin Hart's upbringing. The show is hilarious, bringing tears to my eyes more than once, and the bonus intro and outro only make the package more worthy of buying. Though, as for the stand up portion itself, I think Seriously Funny was a little better. The shortness of this special--a mere 40 minutes--does take away some points though. Just when he seems to be breaking stride he's done. Though, that could just be a testament to his talent. You always want more. Highly recommended.",5,You gon' learn today!,1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,1959,"['Kevin', 'Hart', 'hilarious', 'funniest', 'comedian', 'working', 'talking', 'ostriches', 'running', 'beside', 'car', 'mom', 'unorthodox', 'parenting', 'talent', 'making', 'everything', 'funny', 'Laugh', 'My', 'Pain', 'new', 'level.Laugh', 'My', 'Pain', 'Kevin', 'life', 'Everything', 'dad', 'being', 'drug', 'addict', 'mother', 'funeral', 'divorce', ""n't"", 'hold', 'anything', 'back', 'more', 'just', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'doing', 'stand', 'up', 'Kevin', 'remembering', 'where', 'came', 'remembering', 'situations', 'people', 'made', 'who', 'today', 'first', 'twenty', 'so', 'minutes', 'film', 'nothing', 'culminating', 'emotional', 'speech', 'front', 'family', 'thanking', 'always', 'being', 'there.I', 'get', 'making', 'stand', 'up', 'specials', 'more', 'documentaries', 'popular', 'now', 'Katt', 'Williams', 'been', 'doing', 'while', 'now', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'Laugh', 'My', 'Pain', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Yes', 'intro', 'walking', 'Philadelphia', 'old', 'stomping', 'grounds', 'family', 'supper', 'Yes', 'stand', 'up', 'special', 'special', '30', 'minute', 'show', 'Kevin', 'own', 'spin', 'classic', 'movie', 'Resevoir', 'Dogs', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'funny', 'unexpected', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'Kevin', 'friends', 'un', 'successfully', 'robbing', 'bank.Laugh', 'My', 'Pain', 'touching', 'hilarious', 'show', 'bit', 'more', 'light', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'upbringing', 'show', 'hilarious', 'bringing', 'tears', 'eyes', 'more', 'once', 'bonus', 'intro', 'only', 'make', 'package', 'more', 'worthy', 'buying', 'Though', 'stand', 'up', 'portion', 'think', 'Seriously', 'Funny', 'was', 'little', 'better', 'shortness', 'special', 'mere', '40', 'minutes', 'take', 'away', 'points', 'Just', 'when', 'be', 'breaking', 'done', 'Though', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'testament', 'talent', 'always', 'want', 'more', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Kevin Hart: Laugh At My Pain

I caught some of his stand-up on Comedy Central one day, and I hadn't laughed that hard in a long time. So I'm no bandwagon fan, I've been supporting Kevin since before he made it big. One of the reasons his comedy is so enjoyable to me is that he isn't afraid to laugh & make fun of himself. A great comedian has to be able to handle criticism, and in Laugh at My Pain, Kevin turns some of the negatives he's experienced in his life into laugh out loud positives.I heard so much about Laugh at My Pain before I had even saw it. People were talking about how hilarious it was, so being already familiar with Kevin, I decided to see for myself. I had high expectations and I definitely wasn't disappointed. From the stories of Spongebob removing the top half of his costume at Kevin's daughter's birthday party to smoke a cigarette, to Kevin's crackhead father doing the most insane things, to his crazy religious Cousin Al ruining Kevin's mother's funeral. They all had me cracking up and I have seen it several times and it is still just as funny as it was Day 1. This DVD also surpasses Katt's most recent work Kattpacalypse in quality.

1502511,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B005SHBO1Y,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 3]","There are very few comedians who I support on a regular basis. Outside of Bill Cosby (in his pre-Cosby and ""The Cosby Show"" days), Chris Rock, Wanda Sykes, (the late) Bernie Mac, Cedric the Entertainer, (sometimes) Steve Harvey and Bill Maher are usually my go-to people for comedy, although I am enjoying Chris D'Elia and Whitney Cummings a lot these days, too. However, Kevin Hart came clear out of nowhere and has made me laugh nonstop on every single stand-up routine he's done whether it was just him or with a group of comedians. So when this DVD came out, I bought it. I didn't want to hear one joke before hand (although Chicago radio station 92.3 CONSTANTLY plays Kevin Hart saying ""All right, all right, all right, yeah"" during commercial breaks) because I just KNEW this was going to be as funny as ""Kevin Hart: Seriously Funny."" It wasn't. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the winner that the other DVD was.I was a little disgusted that he tweeted that it was ""Kevin Hart Day"" on MLK's Birthday (Comedy Central showed this DVD that night). Bad timing, dude, but I tried to give him a pass. I did momentarily think of canceling my pre-order for that tweet though. But I didn't.The problem with this DVD was he told a few jokes too many times and reminded me of comedians I don't think are funny. The ""check"" joke was told at least four times and he ended with it. If the crowd was politely laughing the first time, laughing a little bit more the second time and then just kinda giggling the third time, it's probably not the joke to end with. (Steve Harvey has that issue a lot, too. He'll tell a good joke but rub it in so much that it's no longer funny and you just want him to shut up.) The have-sex-quick joke with the stool reminded me of Martin Lawrence, who just loves to gyrate onstage. I have YET to laugh at that kind of comedy. Funny enough, the headboard joke with the mic did crack me up, but it was because it was more clever than raunchy. It's too weird for me to watch a guy pumping on a stool and think it's funny. I just want to look away from the screen. Plus, Bernie Mac has already told the have-sex-quick jokes, and as much as I love Kevin Hart, I think Bernie Mac did them better.Here's the thing. Kevin Hart has never reminded me of any other comedian. He's always been in his own lane, and that's why I like him so much. So I was disappointed that some jokes reminded me of other people's style, especially when the behind-the-scenes interviews of him growing up talked about how the audience needed to get to know him. I didn't crack a smile at him telling his daughter to not be a [insert b-word]. Not cool, especially when he just said he loves his aunt too much to call her one. He LOVES to use that word, and most of the time I can let it roll off, but your daughter? Really? C'mon dude, that's your child. That'll NEVER be funny.Now when he went into the crazy stories of his father and Uncle Richard Jr., I loved them. (I thought that ""Larry King Live"" interview was a parody initially, but then somewhere during the interview, I went, ""Man, this is really his dad! Oh, I've got to see this."" When his dad denied being beat up and said he'd have shot anybody who tried to beat him, all I could do was laugh. And he was almost laid-back about the axe to the face story. Wow, this had to be one of the most interesting interviews I'd seen on CNN.) I enjoyed hearing Kevin tell tales of hanging out with celebs and money. Any time he starts dancing, I'm going to laugh because I like his physical (not raunchy) humor. The hula hooping had me in tears.There were a few other moments where I enjoyed him. There were a lot of celebrities in the audience, too, who seemed to enjoy him. Taraji Henson. Lamman Rucker. Sanaa Lathan. Morris Chestnut. Keri Hilson. Shaquille O'Neal.I didn't NOT like the DVD. I just didn't want to watch it again and again the way I did with ""Seriously Funny,"" and he tried to tell some of those ""say it with your chest"" and ""all day. by myself"" jokes, which seemed a little odd when you're supposed to be putting out new stuff. Don't go to your old standbys to get a laugh. With that said, I still don't regret buying it. I'd still buy his next DVD without watching it first. And I'll probably go see him live.",3,Here's the thing about this comedy DVD versus the last one,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,4271,"['are', 'very', 'few', 'comedians', 'who', 'support', 'regular', 'basis', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'pre-Cosby', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'days', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'late', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'sometimes', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'are', 'usually', 'go-to', 'people', 'comedy', 'am', 'enjoying', 'Chris', ""D'Elia"", 'Whitney', 'Cummings', 'lot', 'days', 'too', 'However', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'came', 'clear', 'nowhere', 'made', 'laugh', 'nonstop', 'single', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'done', 'was', 'just', 'group', 'comedians', 'So', 'when', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'bought', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'one', 'joke', 'hand', 'Chicago', 'radio', 'station', '92.3', 'CONSTANTLY', 'plays', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'saying', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'yeah', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'just', 'KNEW', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'as', 'funny', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'Seriously', 'Funny', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'winner', 'other', 'DVD', 'was.I', 'was', 'little', 'disgusted', 'tweeted', 'was', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'Day', 'MLK', 'Birthday', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'showed', 'DVD', 'night', 'Bad', 'timing', 'dude', 'tried', 'give', 'pass', 'did', 'momentarily', 'think', 'canceling', 'pre-order', 'tweet', ""didn't.The"", 'problem', 'DVD', 'was', 'told', 'few', 'jokes', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'reminded', 'comedians', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'funny', 'check', 'joke', 'was', 'told', 'least', 'four', 'times', 'ended', 'crowd', 'was', 'politely', 'laughing', 'first', 'time', 'laughing', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'then', 'just', 'kinda', 'giggling', 'third', 'time', 'probably', 'not', 'joke', 'end', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'issue', 'lot', 'too', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'good', 'joke', 'rub', 'so', 'much', 'no', 'longer', 'funny', 'just', 'want', 'shut', 'up', 'have-sex-quick', 'joke', 'stool', 'reminded', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'just', 'gyrate', 'onstage', 'have', 'YET', 'laugh', 'kind', 'comedy', 'Funny', 'enough', 'headboard', 'joke', 'mic', 'did', 'crack', 'up', 'was', 'was', 'more', 'clever', 'raunchy', 'too', 'weird', 'watch', 'guy', 'pumping', 'stool', 'think', 'funny', 'just', 'want', 'look', 'away', 'screen', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'already', 'told', 'have-sex-quick', 'jokes', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'think', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'did', 'better.Here', 'thing', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'never', 'reminded', 'other', 'comedian', 'always', 'been', 'own', 'lane', 'why', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'disappointed', 'jokes', 'reminded', 'other', 'people', 'style', 'especially', 'when', 'behind-the-scenes', 'interviews', 'growing', 'up', 'talked', 'how', 'audience', 'needed', 'get', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'crack', 'smile', 'telling', 'daughter', 'not', 'be', '[', 'insert', 'b-word', ']', 'Not', 'cool', 'especially', 'when', 'just', 'said', 'aunt', 'too', 'much', 'call', 'one', 'use', 'word', 'most', 'time', 'can', 'let', 'roll', 'off', 'daughter', 'Really', ""C'mon"", 'dude', 'child', ""'ll"", 'NEVER', 'be', 'funny.Now', 'when', 'went', 'crazy', 'stories', 'father', 'Uncle', 'Richard', 'Jr.', 'loved', 'thought', 'Larry', 'King', 'Live', 'interview', 'was', 'parody', 'initially', 'then', 'somewhere', 'interview', 'went', 'Man', 'really', 'dad', 'Oh', ""'ve"", 'got', 'see', 'When', 'dad', 'denied', 'being', 'beat', 'up', 'said', ""'d"", 'have', 'shot', 'anybody', 'who', 'tried', 'beat', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'laugh', 'was', 'almost', 'laid-back', 'axe', 'face', 'story', 'Wow', 'had', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'interviews', ""'d"", 'seen', 'CNN', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'Kevin', 'tell', 'tales', 'hanging', 'out', 'celebs', 'money', 'time', 'dancing', ""'m"", 'going', 'laugh', 'like', 'physical', 'not', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'hula', 'hooping', 'had', 'were', 'few', 'other', 'moments', 'where', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'lot', 'celebrities', 'audience', 'too', 'who', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'Taraji', 'Henson', 'Lamman', 'Rucker', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'Keri', 'Hilson', 'Shaquille', ""O'Neal.I"", 'did', ""n't"", 'NOT', 'DVD', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'way', 'did', 'Seriously', 'Funny', 'tried', 'tell', 'say', 'chest', 'day', 'jokes', 'seemed', 'little', 'odd', 'when', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'putting', 'out', 'new', 'stuff', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'old', 'standbys', 'get', 'laugh', 'said', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'buying', ""'d"", 'still', 'buy', 'next', 'DVD', 'watching', 'first', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'go', 'see', 'live']",Kevin Hart: Laugh At My Pain
