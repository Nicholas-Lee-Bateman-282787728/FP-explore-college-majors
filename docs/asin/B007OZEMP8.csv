1535368,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,B007OZEMP8,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[6, 6]","Jennifer's Worth's memoir of being a young midwife in the poverty stricken East End of London in the fifties, here turned into a series for the BBC is genuinely moving and inspiring and makes the viewer think about many things - what it means to be a good person, how best to help others, why we as humans visit so much devastation upon each other. The shadow of the Workhouse hangs over this series and that shadow is both edifying and terrifying.The plots deal with many real life issues, terrible living conditions, the forgotten poor and elderly, babies taken from their mothers for adoption without consent or care for the mother or the child, but most affecting of all is the Workhouse. An institution I thought was finished in Dicken's time but that in fact covers almost six hundred years of history. In the most affecting story, the cleaner for the nunnery and her brother were taken to the workhouse when the brother was seven and the sister was barely a toddler. There they were separated. The brother grew up and was released but refused to stop looking for his sister and once he found her, working until he could pay for her release. The two lived together for the rest of their lives, but Frank, is now diagnosed with cancer. How can these two possibly live without each other? Their happiness in each other and in simple pleasures along with the way the workhouse broke them of the ability to have a normal life will affect anyone with a heart.Call the Midwife doesn't lecture, but I had to look up the history of the Workhouse and found that some form of Workhouse as punishment for the poor was extant in England from 1388 as a response to the depredations of the Black Death until 1948. Yes, you read that right, the Workhouse in England is still within living memory. That should sober us here in America when we are considering doing away with programs that help the poor and where our attitude has become punitive. Surely we can find a way to do better with many things in life, but punishing the disadvantaged can't be right for anyone. A look at the results shows that.Perhaps because they are drawn from life, the characters are all amazingly well drawn. The young midwives each have a distinct personality, perhaps most memorably, the overly large, clumsy aristocrat who has fled her family's disappointment in her physical failings, called Chummy. Nor is this a saccharine call to be a good person. The people in these stories are good in the way that people actually are good in that they struggle with their faults, their prejudices and the stresses of the day to try and be kind to one another. When they manage this, as when we do, it is a triumph and that is why this is inspiring. The nuns aren't cut out religious, they are real women who have given their lives to their beliefs and who do better some days than others.I cannot say enough about this wonderful series.

[I guess you could call me doubly-reluctant as I thought BBC America's production, ""Copper,"" was a true dog.]  Eventually, the siren call of ""Call the Midwife"" proved too strong to resist. I consider myself fortunate to have succumbed to the series' charms. It's brilliant TV.""Midwife's"" depiction of London's post-war, baby boom, pre-birth control East End is rich in look and feel.  The set and costume designers have done an incredible job to evoke the memories of that period.  Adding to the authenticity: the series is an adaptation of a memoir by Jennifer Worth, made all the more memorable by Vanessa Redgrave's stirring narration.  Redgrave - not seen - is the voice of the mature Jenny looking back at the period of her life.  Young Jenny Lee is indelibly played by Jessica Raine - a perfect choice.As fans of Graham Norton's show, we were delighted by the presence of Miranda Hart as Jenny's colleague, Chummy Browne.  Hart is so winning and likable, you can't help but smile.  The scenes of her trying to learn to ride a bicycle are classics of physical comedy.The midwives are housed in a convent. The sisters themselves form quite a line-up: the great Pam Ferris; the one and only Jenny Agutter; Judy Parfitt (whose written-off ramblings sound somewhat Shakespearean) and Laura Main, whose beauty can't easily be hidden beneath her habit.",5,Delightful baby boom fare from the BBC,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,1546,"['being', 'led', 'ultimately', 'duped', 'BBC', 'infuriatingly', 'abrupt', 'production', 'Men', 'talk', 'letdown', 'was', 'reluctant', 'commit', 'one', 'series', 'so', 'quickly', '[', 'guess', 'could', 'call', 'doubly-reluctant', 'thought', 'BBC', 'America', 'production', 'Copper', 'was', 'true', 'dog', 'Eventually', 'siren', 'call', 'Call', 'Midwife', 'proved', 'too', 'strong', 'resist', 'consider', 'fortunate', 'have', 'succumbed', 'series', 'charms', 'brilliant', 'TV', 'Midwife', 'depiction', 'London', 'post-war', 'baby', 'boom', 'pre-birth', 'control', 'East', 'End', 'rich', 'look', 'feel', 'set', 'costume', 'designers', 'have', 'done', 'incredible', 'job', 'evoke', 'memories', 'period', 'Adding', 'authenticity', 'series', 'adaptation', 'memoir', 'Jennifer', 'Worth', 'made', 'more', 'memorable', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'stirring', 'narration', 'Redgrave', 'not', 'seen', 'voice', 'mature', 'Jenny', 'looking', 'back', 'period', 'life', 'Young', 'Jenny', 'Lee', 'indelibly', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Raine', 'perfect', 'choice.As', 'fans', 'Graham', 'Norton', 'show', 'were', 'delighted', 'presence', 'Miranda', 'Hart', 'Jenny', 'colleague', 'Chummy', 'Browne', 'Hart', 'so', 'winning', 'likable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'scenes', 'trying', 'learn', 'ride', 'bicycle', 'are', 'classics', 'physical', 'comedy.The', 'midwives', 'are', 'housed', 'convent', 'sisters', 'form', 'quite', 'line-up', 'great', 'Pam', 'Ferris', 'one', 'only', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'written-off', 'ramblings', 'sound', 'somewhat', 'Shakespearean', 'Laura', 'Main', 'beauty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'easily', 'be', 'hidden', 'beneath', 'habit']",N/A

Once again the BBC has really pulled it off: five stars, a-plus, this merits them all. Sometimes hilariously funny, sometimes deeply moving, it consistently holds and rewards our attention.  The stories (which are true) are amazing, the acting excellent, and the production flawless. I am old enough to remember something of fifties London, and they have it right (except perhaps that the cars as I remember them back then were not quite so clean and shiny, and the saddleback shunting engine in the dockyards certainly wasn't!).  But how pleasant to see a group of Anglican religious portrayed for once on TV not as fools, objects of ridicule, or dangerous lunatics, but as what they so often really are--people of compassion, humor, common sense, and grace.  I would offer one caution--several of the reviews of this series that I have read compare it in one way or another to Downton Abbey.  Apart from the fact that both are British, the two series appear to me to have little in common.  Downton Abbey plays with stereotypes of the British aristocracy in the early 20th century, and is no doubt quite amusing (although not, I confess, to me).

I recall reading an article in the TV Guide a few months about the show, but I had forgotten it was being aired. Luckily, I got an opportunity to receive a free copy of Season One in exchange of an honest review courtesy of BBC Worldwide Americas.The series was created and written by Heidi Thomas (also created Upstairs Downstairs) and is based on the memoirs of the late Jennifer Worth. Set in the poverty-stricken East London in the 1950s, the series centers around a young Jenny Lee (played by Jessica Raine), who believes she is going to be working at a small hospital called Nonnatus House, but to her surprise, it is actually a convent. She quickly befriends the other nurses, Trixie and Cynthia, the handyman Fred, and the Sisters, Julienne, Evangelina, Bernadette and Monica Joan. Jenny is there mainly as a midwife, but she has other duties to attend to as well. Just like the other midwives, Jenny must ride a bicycle to visit her patients.The second episode introduces another supporting character, a tall woman named Chummy Browne, who shows up at the Nonnatus House wearing a pink uniform. She is an oddball character that doesn't quite fit in with the other nurses at first. She can't even ride a bicycle when she arrives, but she learns by the end of the episode.There are only six episodes in the first season, running about sixty minutes each, but each episode is extremely well written and the cast does a remarkable job with their parts. Vanessa Redgrave provides the narration for each episode as an older Jenny.I'm well aware of what a midwife does, but my first thought was that the series would be boring. To my surprise, Call the Midwife is anything but boring. I became instantly addicted to the show after the end of episode one. I had no idea what life was like back in 1950 as I'm only a 31-year-old, so I more than enjoyed the little details from the costumes to the streets of East London. I knew that times were tough back then, but I didn't know the poverty was that horrible. The main character Jenny is adorable, but Chummy steals every scene she is in. I absolutely fell in love with the show.

Her life had already been disrupted by WWII and an intense affair when she was only 16. Worth's luminous observations on the human condition, our quest for meaning in the darkest despair, her pointing out what really matters, are strewn with keen compassion and intelligence. Her narrative shines amidst. The superb script is written by Heidi Thomas (Cranford: The Collection (Cranford/Return to Cranford)) and beautifully narrated by Vanessa Redgrave. Jessica Raine is perfection as the nave, tormented young Worth, and the whole cast is marvelous, from Judy Parfitt (Dean Spanley,Vera: Set 2) as the light-fingered nun, Sister Monica Joan, to the gifted Miranda Hart as the plain, upper-crust yet down to earth Chummy Browne. Chummy is dominated by a cruel mother, yet she overcomes her limitations and discovers love. Among other fine cast members, Jenny Agutter is Sister Julienne, Helen George is Trixie Franklin, Pam Ferris (Rosemary & Thyme) is the cake-loving Sister Evangelina, and Bryony Hannah is perfection as Cynthia Miller. Cynthia is moved by the tragedy of a deeply loving couple expecting their first-born, when the wife suffers from eclampsia. This show isn't for the faint-hearted, blood and birth are vividly depicted, as is the poverty and grime. But this grittiness only adds depth to the subject matter.

Even though loved by so many people all over the world, I've always considered shows produced by the BBC or British television on PBS as, boring time-pieces that I'd have no intrest in. My wife kept raving about one episode of ""Call The Midwife"" that she watched on our local PBS channel, so she decided to buy this first season.This show's content seemed to go against almost everything I dislike about some of the ""Ladies Shows"" she watches. ""Just how many more programs about child birth can one person watch?"" I didn't want to give in, but as the DVD case sat next to the televison for over a week, I peeked on Amazon to read a bit about this program. With all of the positive reviews, I caved in and told her that when she started to view this show, I'd give it a look-at.Being a man, am I supposed to like a show like this so much? I was immediately transported back to the late 50's in East London and from the moment Sister Monica Joan answers the door to Nonnatus House, I'm overtaken by this piece of brilliant British story telling.Each and every character is brought to life with outstanding actors in each role, all of which I've never seen before. Each story is written with a bit of wit and lots of emotion. I usually only get choked up at funerals, but hell, I can't remember the last time I got teary-eyed watching a television program...during sad and happy moments.I could go on for paragraphs about this show. Especially the ""Georgie-girlish"" character, ""Chummy"", who'll win you over once you meet her. I just want to let men know that it is okay to watch ""Call The Midwife."" It's a piece of television that should not be missed. And the best part...there is more to come.And to show just how much one man can change, after viewing ""Call The Midwife"", I immediately went on-line here at Amazon and bought seasons 1&2 of ""Downton Abbey"" and can't decided which show I like best. Not that it matters. I've found a new love that my stubborn 53 year old self has always deprived itself of...a love for, and new adventure into British television programs.",5,"ATTENTION MEN!

The heart of it was in the fifties when the story is written about. The area of London seriously needs help and the girls have committed to help the people who live there.  Jennifer Worth (Jenny Lee is her maiden name)  is who the story is about and she passed away 2 weeks before they started filming. I was sad to hear this as the woman must have been a saint!The other characters in the series are also wonderful actresses and actors.

When I read the reviews I first thought that this series about a young midwife working in the East End of London in the 1950s wouldn't appeal to me, but I decided to give the first episode a try.  Within five minutes I was completely captivated.Jenny Lee is a young middle-class girl.  Trained as nurse, she goes to work at Nonnatus House, an Anglican order of nursing nuns in the East End, as one of a team of midwives.  At first she is appalled by the conditions in which the women she works with live and by the brutality and vulgarity of their lives, but soon she grows to respect and admire their courage, honor, and humor.  In turn they respect her for her steadfast determination to help them and their babies.The six episodes in this first season are filled with unforgettable characters: Jenny and her fellow midwives, most memorably the gawky Nurse Chummy, who comes from an aristocratic family but takes on and succeeds with the most difficult cases; Sisters Evangelina, Bernadette, and Julienne from Nonnatus House: the ethererally batty Sister Monica Joan; and the women of the East End themselves like Conchita, mother of 25 children with endless amounts of love for them all or Mary, a 15 year old prostitute whose baby is brutally taken from her.  There are many more beautifully crafted characters in these six episodes, noone of whom will be easy to forget.If you watched this series on PBS in the US you are in for a few surprises in this DVD set of the original British series.  PBS censored a few scenes here and there, most memorably a segment of Episode 5 in which Nurse Chummy bravely gives a class on male contraception (using a detailed prop or two) to a group of East End women.  At first the women are having a good time making ribald comments, but Chummy's sincerity and her obvious determination to help them eventually settles them down.  It's hilarious but deeply impressive to watch this scene, which by itself is worth the price of the DVD set.

1535463,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007OZEMP8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[102, 106]","A surprise ratings smash in Britain, ""Call The Midwife"" makes its North American DVD/Blu-ray debut shortly after having aired on nationwide PBS stations.  I'm pleased to report that ""Call The Midwife"" is a true rarity in television programming and I mean that in the most complimentary way possible.  Based on the best-selling memoirs of Jennifer Worth, the show examines the health and welfare conditions of East London in the fifties.  As a young midwife (Jessica Raine) takes an assignment to work for the underprivileged, she is surprised to be stationed at a nunnery as opposed to a clinic or hospital.  But she will soon find out that things are done a bit differently than she expected.  In the wrong hands, ""Call the Midwife"" might have been turned into a show filled with a false syrupy sentimentality.  But here, we find just the right balance.  Nostalgia is tinged with reality.  Hope is dampened with real world deprivation.  The world depicted can be hard and unsavory and its inhabitants struggle for normalcy and survival.  But don't get me wrong, that doesn't make ""Call The Midwife"" depressing or downbeat.  It just makes it real and compelling and the show is also infused with humor throughout.  It's a rare (and hard to achieve) combination of sweet and tough!Both the DVD and Blu-ray release will contain the six episodes of Season One with a total running time just shy of six hours.  The extras included are cast and crew interviews.""Call The Midwife"" is episodic by nature.  Within each episode, the nurses will contend with various patients (both within the eight bed clinic and the community itself).  The conditions are abhorrent and the poverty is apparent, but the young women are dedicated to their profession.  Some of the storylines will play for poignancy, some for comedy, and some for harrowing drama.  It is all blended seamlessly into a rich and rewarding tapestry of life (OK, that was corny even by my standards).  Along the way, we get to know each of the women more intimately.  And as their personal stories unfold, it really brings a needed dimension to understanding the commitment necessary to being a midwife.The regular cast is incredibly strong.  Raine, in a star making turn, really develops great strength as the series progresses.  Vanessa Redgrave even narrates the episodes as an older version of Raine.  A trio of stellar actresses are on hand as nuns, the elders that mentor the young midwives and often clash with one another in amusing ways: Judy Parfitt, Pam Ferris, and Jenny Agutter.  But the entire supporting cast, even those only appearing in one episode, perfectly support the material.  I do want, however, to make special mention of my favorite character.  In Episode Two, a new arrival at the convent (Chummy Browne played by Miranda Hart) perplexes everyone with her offbeat ways (and her lack of bicycling talent).  She is an absolutely fascinating character who seems to have appeared for comic affect, but gets some of the most emotional storylines in future episodes.  She is so unpredictable, I just love to watch her!  Hart was nominated for a BAFTA as Best Supporting Actress, so apparently I am not alone in my love for Chummy!  An adult show that expertly blends pathos with real world considerations, this show is winning, humorous, and oftentimes moving.

1535494,A1FY6ETS4ZPCUE,B007OZEMP8,Mr. Mambo,"[3, 3]","....How Truly Great This Series Is!With almost 700 reviews for this series, and with those reviews averaging close to the five-star maximum, it's obvious that this series has struck a chord with people. I have to admit I was late in tuning in....my tastes run more toward the Brit crime or comedy genres. If I could find a comparison, I'd mention All Creatures Great and Small. Both shows are set in the past, based upon real life, with it's good times, bad times, sad times, and glad times. I am very sorry that I took so long to tune in. This superb program has more to offer than 99% of the TV shows and movies out there. I'm a Downton Abbey fan, and an eager and enthusiastic devotee of just about any TV or film production having anything to do with England. I would say without equivocation that Call the Midwife is one of the finest programs I've ever seen. It's worthy of SIX stars.Yes, the acting is exceptional, the stories and characters endlessly fascinating, the writing and dialogue completely believable, but in addition to all that, the creators of the show have paid special attention to the LOOK of the sets and the characters. Great care has obviously gone into each and every shot. There is an epidemic in today's movies and TV which is characterized by the shaking camera, short, frenetic cuts and gigantic closeups of faces. These lazy, cliched and careless techniques are designed to hide the fact that minimal  attention has been paid to composition and lighting and set construction. It is almost as if the filmmakers had no clue on one of the ABC's of film: how to compose, frame, and light a shot. Downton has been praised for its attention to detail, colors and lighting, and the same could be said of Call the Midwife. Even though we see a gray, greasy and grimy version of London and its environs, we glimpse moments of beauty, subtle but rich color, deep focus activity behind the main characters in a scene...in other words, a huge amount of artful planning and loving care has gone into the creation of the show.In the first episode, I found myself howling with laughter....and weeping with sadness, within ten minutes of each other. The series is based upon the memoirs of an actual English midwife who worked in London's East End in the 1950's. The East End was, and in many cases, still is, a gritty, rough-and-tumble working class area, rife with poverty and degradation....the opposite of 'posh'. As they say, life here can be nasty, brutish and short. No punches appeared to be pulled. In fact, when Jessica Raine, playing Jenny Lee, the new young midwife, first enters the neighborhood, she walks right into a snarling cat fight between two women--one of them pregnant!--scrapping over a man. Not all the births are happy and blessed and joyful. My wife spent many years as an obstetrical nurse and she tells me that the birthing scenes are quite realistic. My mother smoked while she was pregnant with me, probably drank as well, but that was due to ignorance, and, in the series, most of the pregnant women depicted are not in a position to be overly concerned about the health of their unborn children. No, most of them are more preoccupied with finding their next meal, or with taking care of the kids they already have.Pam Ferris as Sister Evangelista (from Rosemary and Thyme) is great and hugely funny as she hurls delightfully caustic lines toward her fumbling and bumbling underlings. Jenny Agutter is the image of the happy, positive and patient nun who sees the bright side of everything and everyone. Miranda Hart is sweet and kind and funny and poignant as an upper class girl who happens to be much larger physically than most of the men she would be interested in. Her Chummy Browne has a heart as big as her ungainly frame.You will grow to love these characters and this series, and you will learn a lot from them as well.",5,Words Cannot Express.....,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,3878,"['.How', 'Truly', 'Great', 'Series', 'almost', '700', 'reviews', 'series', 'reviews', 'averaging', 'close', 'five-star', 'maximum', 'obvious', 'series', 'struck', 'chord', 'people', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'late', 'tuning', '.my', 'tastes', 'run', 'more', 'Brit', 'crime', 'comedy', 'genres', 'could', 'find', 'comparison', ""'d"", 'mention', 'Creatures', 'Great', 'Small', 'shows', 'are', 'set', 'past', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'good', 'times', 'bad', 'times', 'sad', 'times', 'glad', 'times', 'am', 'very', 'sorry', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'tune', 'superb', 'program', 'more', 'offer', '99', '%', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'out', 'there', ""'m"", 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'fan', 'eager', 'enthusiastic', 'devotee', 'just', 'TV', 'film', 'production', 'having', 'anything', 'do', 'England', 'would', 'say', 'equivocation', 'Midwife', 'one', 'finest', 'programs', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'worthy', 'SIX', 'stars.Yes', 'acting', 'exceptional', 'stories', 'characters', 'endlessly', 'fascinating', 'writing', 'dialogue', 'completely', 'believable', 'addition', 'creators', 'show', 'have', 'paid', 'special', 'attention', 'LOOK', 'sets', 'characters', 'Great', 'care', 'obviously', 'gone', 'shot', 'epidemic', 'today', 'movies', 'TV', 'characterized', 'shaking', 'camera', 'short', 'frenetic', 'cuts', 'gigantic', 'closeups', 'lazy', 'cliched', 'careless', 'techniques', 'are', 'designed', 'hide', 'fact', 'minimal', 'attention', 'been', 'paid', 'composition', 'lighting', 'set', 'construction', 'almost', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'clue', 'one', 'ABC', 'film', 'how', 'compose', 'frame', 'light', 'shot', 'Downton', 'been', 'praised', 'attention', 'detail', 'colors', 'lighting', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Call', 'Midwife', 'Even', 'see', 'gray', 'greasy', 'grimy', 'version', 'London', 'environs', 'glimpse', 'moments', 'beauty', 'subtle', 'rich', 'color', 'deep', 'focus', 'activity', 'main', 'characters', 'scene', 'other', 'words', 'huge', 'amount', 'artful', 'planning', 'loving', 'care', 'gone', 'creation', 'show.In', 'first', 'episode', 'found', 'howling', 'laughter', '.and', 'weeping', 'sadness', 'ten', 'minutes', 'other', 'series', 'based', 'memoirs', 'actual', 'English', 'midwife', 'who', 'worked', 'London', 'East', 'End', '1950', 'East', 'End', 'was', 'many', 'cases', 'still', 'gritty', 'rough-and-tumble', 'working', 'class', 'area', 'rife', 'poverty', 'degradation', '.the', 'opposite', ""'posh"", 'say', 'life', 'here', 'can', 'be', 'nasty', 'brutish', 'short', 'punches', 'appeared', 'be', 'pulled', 'fact', 'when', 'Jessica', 'Raine', 'playing', 'Jenny', 'Lee', 'new', 'young', 'midwife', 'first', 'neighborhood', 'walks', 'right', 'snarling', 'cat', 'fight', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'pregnant', 'scrapping', 'man', 'Not', 'births', 'are', 'happy', 'blessed', 'joyful', 'wife', 'spent', 'many', 'years', 'obstetrical', 'nurse', 'birthing', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'realistic', 'mother', 'smoked', 'was', 'pregnant', 'probably', 'drank', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'due', 'ignorance', 'series', 'most', 'pregnant', 'women', 'depicted', 'are', 'not', 'position', 'be', 'overly', 'concerned', 'health', 'unborn', 'children', 'No', 'most', 'are', 'more', 'preoccupied', 'finding', 'next', 'meal', 'taking', 'care', 'kids', 'already', 'have.Pam', 'Ferris', 'Sister', 'Evangelista', 'Rosemary', 'Thyme', 'great', 'hugely', 'funny', 'delightfully', 'caustic', 'lines', 'fumbling', 'bumbling', 'underlings', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'image', 'happy', 'positive', 'patient', 'nun', 'who', 'bright', 'side', 'everything', 'everyone', 'Miranda', 'Hart', 'sweet', 'kind', 'funny', 'poignant', 'upper', 'class', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'much', 'larger', 'physically', 'most', 'men', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'Chummy', 'Browne', 'heart', 'as', 'big', 'ungainly', 'frame.You', 'will', 'grow', 'love', 'characters', 'series', 'will', 'learn', 'lot', 'as', 'well']",N/A

1535498,A3EPHBMU07LZ50,B007OZEMP8,Mysterious Reviewer,"[0, 0]","Somehow the United States creative minds have lost the ability to create intelligent and heartwarming entertainment. Thankfully, the BBC continues to offer programming that is intelligent, well-written and balanced and the television show Call the Midwife proves this out. Call the Midwife is based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth the television shows how the midwives and medically trained sisters deal with deliveries and poverty. Balancing the drama is the character Chummy, who comes from a noble background, and ends up working with the impoverished. Chummy is a rather tall, and somewhat bumbley character, who seems to be what my mother would call a bull in a china shop. In other words, Chummy tries very hard to fit in, but due to her great height and size, spends time bumping into things with mood lightening results. Watching Chummy learn to ride a bicycle was very funny too. Her heart is gold and she eventually learns to fit in with the nurses and sisters at the Nonnatus House leading to much less bumping around.I also enjoyed the music, especially listening to one of my favorite jazz artists named Blossom Dearie, who has a soft, little girl voice that knows how to sing. You will hear other jazz tunes and a dip into the 1950s jazzy dance music that calls for you to jump up and Jitterbug.If you enjoy watching intelligent, well-written television I am sure you will love watching Call the Midwife.Note:  I would not recommend watching this show when children are around.

The childbirth scenes had me squirming -- it was bad enough in real life! I have no desire to revisit the experience onscreen.But I have to say, I continued on with the series because of the characters. The personal lives of the nurses and nuns kept me interested. The families they served were less interesting to me, because they were unbelievable. The show's depiction of life in the East End of London seemed overly optimistic to me.It's hard to believe that in this notoriously poverty-stricken area, these women are all in love with their men and thrilled to have another child. One woman has 24 children, looks to be about 30 years old and acts like a honeymooner around her husband... and she can't even speak his language. Another woman has a mixed-race baby, although she and her husband are both Caucasian; he's the product of a one-night stand. And the husband is just hunky-dory with that, never even mentions it. The absent sailor who fathers triplets magically shows up and transforms into a loving husband and doting father. (Not to mention that the nurses wheel around on bikes through the docklands without a care in the world for their personal safety.)That's what frustrated me about this series. It insists on a Pollyanna view of life, sanitizing a world that seemed more accurately depicted in shows likeLondon HospitalandBramwell. A lot of talk about love and hope, which I'm all for, but just can't accept as a reality in this time and place.

1535525,A2JIMJ2B2SBNY2,B007OZEMP8,Sharon Upchurch,"[23, 25]","This series is addictive.  It is a series about a group of young women and their older female mentors who have found a true calling.  They have endless doubts about their ability to complete the tasks but they still find the courage to do what needs to be done.  Call the Midwife resonates with me for several reasons.  My grandmother did similar public health nursing work in a rural area of Illinois just before WWI.  She graduated from Nursing School in 1909 and was immediately sent out to do public health work in an under-served area.  Her work involved being the primary health care for those residents, including delivering babies and setting broken bones.  So, this series intrigued me when I first heard about it.  I have watched all the episodes so far and it lives up to its promise.  The situations are realistic about a time when England was just beginning to emerge from rationing and the National Health Service had begun to make a real difference in the lives of the poorest Britains.  There is the sense that poverty in 1957 was the same today in many ways but there are also cultural differences.  One thing I noticed was that most of the babies are born to married parents.  The parents were mostly working poor.  The men mostly had jobs and the women were stay-at-home wives and mothers even though the family struggled.  Children played the same kinds of games that most children played except they played in the streets.  The young nurses are true to their calling and to the time in which they lived. Women's Liberation was a long way off.  Like my grandmother, young nurses (unmarried women) couldn't live on their own without chaperones.  These nurses are essentially living in a convent.  My grandmother also lived in an all-female dormitory during nursing school and when she came back to work in the hospital as a widow during the Depression.  She had to send her two young sons to live with her mother on the family farm because she wasn't allowed to bring them with her.  The sequestration of professional women like nurses was an injustice to them and denied the existence of personal integrity.  I love the period music in the show.  The music sets a mood and seems to be almost a character in the drama.  The series is based on the memoirs of the main character, a young woman just qualified sent to work in London's East End.  Her older self is the narrator at the beginning and the end of each episode.  This lends a sense of authenticity and realism to the stories.

Why the executives and producers of Hollywood television don't take points on story-telling, is beyond me. There is a reason we flock to Downton Abbey and Call the Midwife, plus many other wonderful shows on PBS.  It's drama at its best, stories with heart, and actors who take us into the reality of other worlds.Call the Midwife is a moving series set in post war early 1950's about a group of nurses and nuns who deliver babies on the impoverished east side of London. (I was born in 1950, so I fit right in.) The series instantly reminds you of the scriptures that declare the poor will always live among us. It is what we do for the poor that matters the most.The series is, of course, geared toward women. After all, babies are delivered every episode.  The old ways of enema, shaving, and odd delivery positions is quite amusing, but so are the variety of women who bear the children and their midwives.  If you are prone to PMS, bursts of crying, or are pregnant make sure you bring a box of tissues with you as you watch.  The stories will move you to tears as you are faced with the stark reality of birth, life, death, suffering, love, and survival.Each episode focuses upon a main pregnancy ranging from the woman who is married and on her 24th pregnancy (yes, they birthed that many children), to the young 15 year old prostitute who sells her body to survive and becomes pregnant.  One breach birth will keep you on the edge of your seat, as you watch the new awkward nurse deliver the child successfully.  You see the devastation of women losing their babies, and women who lose their lives giving birth.  You'll cry over the poor and the squalor in which they live.  At the end of each episode, you'll be a better human being for watching the miracle of birth and no doubt be thankful for what you have.Call the Midwife is once again why I love the Brits.  It's drama, humor, life, and love all rolled into one.  It's reality, not fantasy. Frankly, I think watching this series births within you a new appreciation of life and love through all of its struggles.  You'll find empathy for the poor among us, and be thankful for what you have.  We shouldn't abort the difficulties of life in television shows just because we don't want to deal with the unpleasantness.

The show really fleshed out the characters and made them come to life. The story lines are great, following the book closely. Usually books are better, but not this time!
