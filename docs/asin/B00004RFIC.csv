On this show, however, he seems to be intent upon embarrassing himself.  The only good two minutes was his Elvis impersonation; otherwise, this is flat, unfunny, almost an insult to the audience.",2,A waste of money,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,278,"['saw', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'TV', 'several', 'times', '1970s', 'when', 'was', 'extremely', 'funny', 'show', 'however', 'be', 'intent', 'embarrassing', 'only', 'good', 'two', 'minutes', 'was', 'Elvis', 'impersonation', 'otherwise', 'flat', 'unfunny', 'almost', 'insult', 'audience']",N/A

So I have it on VHS. Don't know if this DVD has extras--but the show itself is wonderful!! I think it is the best of the Andy shows. Andy had wanted to make this a regular show, and it's too bad that he didn't accomplish that. It was hilarious! It starts off with the show's last 5-or-so minutes, making you think you missed it all, coming in late. But no...The Beverly Hills Museum of Broadcasting also screened this ( as well as Andy's Special ) as part of a tribute to him, pre-Man on the Moon.

The only thing worth watching on this one-hour show, was the Elvis impression!  The other 58 minutes of this one-hour show, was boring and not funny at all!  Thank God I didn't buy this!

As you watch this old PBS special, you  will feel like you are watching pro wrestling, Andy's favorite.  You know  it's all rigged, yet the little voice in the back of your mind peeps to  you, &quot;Is it REALLY?&quot;The fight with Elaine boosler is  HILARIOUS, and &quot;Has-Been Corner&quot; will make you cringe.  The  silly, kiddie antics thrown in by Andy will make you giggle, and the Tony  Clifton puppet is a perfect sidekick!  Oh, and catch the height of Andy's  desk as a subliminal sleight to Johnny Carson!This DVD will delight  every Andy Kaufman fann, yet it will only prove to those who don't like him  the reasons why they don't.  IF you love Andy like I do, buy this.  If you  don't, go listen to your Andrew Dice Clay tapes again.",4,He's From Hollywood.
