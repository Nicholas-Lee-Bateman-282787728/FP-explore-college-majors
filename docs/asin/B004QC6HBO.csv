The music and innovative dancing are great. Unfortunately the director/editor didn't choose to show the performance, but decided instead to slice it into 1 second shots from all over the place, so we can rarely ever see what's happening on stage. INFURIATING to try to watch a show edited like this, and it does a great disservice to the dancers and choreographers because we don't get a chance to really see what they are doing like the live audience got to see. So a 5 star show is lowered to a 2 star video, ruined by bad editing.",2,Terrible over-editing,1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,638,"['give', 'five', 'stars', 'David', 'Byrne', 'band', 'choreographers', 'dancers', 'great', 'performance', 'music', 'innovative', 'dancing', 'are', 'great', 'Unfortunately', 'director/editor', 'did', ""n't"", 'choose', 'show', 'performance', 'decided', 'instead', 'slice', '1', 'second', 'shots', 'place', 'can', 'rarely', 'ever', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'stage', 'INFURIATING', 'try', 'watch', 'show', 'edited', 'great', 'disservice', 'dancers', 'choreographers', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'really', 'see', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'live', 'audience', 'got', 'see', 'So', '5', 'star', 'show', 'lowered', '2', 'star', 'video', 'ruined', 'bad', 'editing']",N/A

David Byrne put a lot of creativity and effort into making an acoustical and visual delight. From what I could get out of the video, it would have been visually wonderful. The dancers were young, graceful and exuberant. The musicians and singers were well choreographed too. However the cameras and editing were apparently done by people suffering from extreme ADHD. The camera cut back and forth and all over. Camera shots were pieced together without any concern for the stage production. One could almost never see what was actually happening. Byrne's Stop Making Sense video set the high water mark for live concert videos. The cameras and editing supported the music and stage productions. It was thrilling! Fred Astaire had it right when he always insisted that his dance numbers showed him full length without editing in the middle of the dance. Who ever did this should go back to film school and learn how to do it right. I am surprised David Byrne allowed this to be done to his work.

In it, Pareles commented that he thought the dancers in the show were a distraction. David Byrne, for his part, wrote a scathing rebuttal in his blog, in which he said, among other things, ""I guess 30 years from now (Pareles)'ll figure out what this show was about.""In Ride, Rise Roar, Byrne says that when he came up with the idea to use dancers as part of the show, he wasn't sure how the audience would react, but he was looking forward to finding out.  Having seen three of the tour's shows at the time, I didn't fully get what the dancers were about, but thought the shows were great.  As you watch RRR, Byrne, the choreographers, the dancers, and the musicians all take turns explaining how the show was conceptually put together song by song. By the end you do get a much better sense of ""what this show was about"".This is a great documentary.  The concert footage is at times more effective than Stop Making Sense, and the picture and sound quality are nothing short of unbelievable.

We were sitting right up the back (and to the side). From there the whole show sounded big and beautiful, and the choreography (complimented by excellent lighting) made me 100% aware that I was experiencing pure unique showbusiness - something very special indeed. From the back of the venue this was a show that made use of the whole stage, and almost all of the time.So the wonderful thing about this Blu-ray is that I now have a complete impression of the show - the close-ups I could only imagine, the entertaining background story, and perfect surround sound. I am very happy with the way this film proves the value and integrity of the show, and gives us an insider appreciation of the intricacies involved.I like the comment made by the male dancer about David Byrne aggressively berating a security guard who was trying to confiscate a punter's camera - having already made it clear to the security people that punters could take as many photos as they liked. (The complete opposite of Placebo at the same venue a few years earlier, when Brian Molko spotted the red glow of a camera LED, stopped the show, brought up the house lights and demanded that security eject the poor guy with the camera).David Byrne doesn't ever do a half-arsed job.

It's a pity that you simply can't take the concert in and be surprised by what Byrne had on offer. Clearly the work of a guy who needs other Heads to tell him, Look, Mr Renaissance, let the music and dance do the talking.My wife's reaction was that the film was boring and the others looked bored silly. Stop Making Sense this isn't. Maybe on a second pressing, DB will rethink the value of explaining how he downloaded files Eno emailed to him. Oy. I'm guessing this was shot in NYC. He looks like he's singing and playing to record exec types in the front row, who are just standing there watching him. There are the usual Jonathan Demme knock off film angles that make an ever energetic group of band and dancers look exhausted. Seems they did this in a theatre with no a/c.Honestly, I can figure out dance. I don't need the choreographer telling me how difficult it was to take static props like a mikc and make them dynamic dance partners.There are much better DB concert films - notably the one shot in the church in England.

1424014,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B004QC6HBO,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[3, 3]","This is once ""concert DVD"" that really took me by surprise. But a VERY pleasant one! I have only seen David Byrne play on music videos by his former band Talking Heads and in the Jonathan Demme filmed TH concert ""Stop Making Sense"". So I expected a ""making of a concert"" film when I popped this DVD into my player. Was I ever wrong!I'm a big fan of modern dance and attend a lot of performance by modern dance groups. If you are a dance fan, you'll definitely want to see this film.The concept of the project being documented in this film is the 2008 tour that Byrne put together after his new album of David Byrne-Brian Eno songs was finished. Byrne chose three young modern dance choreographers to choreograph the songs - both old TH standards like ""Burning Down The House"" and ""Once In A Lifetime"" along with newer compositions. He then auditioned to find three young dancers (two women and a man). But it wasn't just the three dancers who are dancing in this film - pieced together from three performances in California, Virginia and Albany, NY. The three backup singers (some of who also play instruments) get dance as well. (You can see from the brief rehearsal footage included that this really was - as one puts it - ""boot camp"" for them.)In one clever number the dancers, singers and Byrne (who also does some wonderful dance moves as he sings and plays) sit on moving chairs through the full number. This is contrasted with the audience who were watching in a ""standing only"" venue!The rehearsal footage is seamlessly edited with the concert footage making the production even more exciting. And the ""talking interview"" sections are brief allowing you to watch this as a concert film on repeat viewing.I must admit that I loved TH's performances and Byrne and Eno's music but never quite understood the meaning of the lyrics. One of the choreographers says the same thing and reveals that she only thought of the rhythm. Then near the end - in a short interview with Byrne and Eno - Byrne reveals that the words ""have no real meaning. Like the music (he) uses them for effect!"".While some Byrne music fans may gripe that a song or two was missing from this concert tour, the film will appear to a wider audience, opening up his music to the large audience for modern dance. And maybe it will convince some TH fans to check out a modern dance performance in their area.

1424015,A3FOJT2NKP5WD5,B004QC6HBO,"William Lynd ""lynd8""","[32, 33]","I was looking forward to this DVD having been to the show in 2008.  For those not lucky enough to see it, David Byrne put together quite a show - great songs from his CD ""Everything That Will Happen Will Happen Today"" (that he collaborated on with Brian Eno). The show also focused on other Eno-Byrne tracks from the Talking Heads 70's-80's albums.  Byrne added several dancers to the stage for these shows and the results were pretty interesting - definitely a visual show rather than just an audio experience.  The DVD however is edited quite heavily and omits several songs played on the tour and in between the songs (fortunately no songs are cut) there is some backstage and behind the scenes footage.  It's obviously just my opinion but this footage would have made for a nice bonus feature instead, and having more of the concert without editing would have been a little better.  Some of the backstage footage admittedly is interesting as sometimes it introduces the songs, but for me the concert feels a little too chopped up.  The DVD is still really great to have though - the sound and picture are both good and the footage is pretty cool - apparently shot with advanced hand held cameras.  So, I'll go with four stars - if the DVD was a little longer and included more songs it could have been five.  There are some great songs performed on this tour that were left off for some reason, notably ""Strange Overtones"", ""Help Me Somebody"" ""My Big Hands"", ""Wanted For Life"" and ""Born Under Punches"".
