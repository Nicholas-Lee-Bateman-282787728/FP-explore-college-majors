Since the video is DVD quality you see a lot of nuances that are lost in the TV broadcast that make the show even funnier. They didn't skimp on the video and audio quality like most TV to DVD transfers. I guess they are aware of the bootlegs circulating and want the fans to buy the real thing at the highest quality. Can't wait for Seasons 2 & 3 with Brutherman and Hustleman to be released, they are even funnier than Season 1.",5,Finally Martin Show is released on DVD,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,489,"['are', 'fan', 'show', 'DVD', 'set', 'MUST', 'HAVE', 'video', 'DVD', 'quality', 'see', 'lot', 'nuances', 'are', 'lost', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'make', 'show', 'even', 'funnier', 'did', ""n't"", 'skimp', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'most', 'TV', 'DVD', 'transfers', 'guess', 'are', 'aware', 'bootlegs', 'circulating', 'want', 'fans', 'buy', 'real', 'thing', 'highest', 'quality', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Seasons', '2', '3', 'Brutherman', 'Hustleman', 'be', 'released', 'are', 'even', 'funnier', 'Season', '1']",Martin - The Complete First Season

Gibson ""70's tv addict!!!""","[1, 1]","I am so happy Martin has finally been immortalized on dvd, considering so many horrible trash tv shows get released alot faster??? I'll never understand that logic!!! Anyways, I had'nt seen this show in years so I made sure to buy it on the day of release. I was even excited to hear the opening theme music!!!Very few sitcoms have a decent pilot, but Martin's was hillarious, because I always loved when he did other characters like Shenehneh, Mama Payne, and my personal favorite the playa Jerome!!!The episodes have crisp sound and picture, but my only complaint outside no decent extras is no episode guide. Even if there's not one included separately, they could have at least wrote the episodes inside the box set! I had to go on the internet to get the complete episode guide!All in all a decent release of one of the last great sitcoms of the 90""s!!!

It's knid of like looking out across your balcony and seeing all the zannyness; but on television.
