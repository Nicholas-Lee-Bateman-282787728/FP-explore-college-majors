1054401,A2EVXI7A6ECPJU,B000N6UESE,"Analog ""Evil_Spud_Boy""","[8, 8]","Like all the other reviewers stated, the monster vs. mascot show is completely butchered up.  It seemed to be the unanimous favorite, as it is also my favorite episode, and one of the reasons I bought this DVD.  I was really looking foreward to seeing Queerwig and Inoperable Tumora again, but sadly, neither is present.  I don't feel that it detracts so much from the other content, as the rest of the episodes are extremely funny and entertaining.  Another episode of Takeshi's Castle is also included along with a behind the scenes special feature.  The commentary is sexual as ever, and the names and job descriptions of the participants are hilarious.  I don't know where these guys come up with this stuff, but is sure is great!  4 out of 5 stars for the circumcised version of monsters vs. mascots, but still, if you're a fan, don't be afraid to buy it.  **Just a note:  The original version of monsters vs. mascots is viewable on youtube.  You'll have to watch it in separate sections, but it's all there if you search.",4,Too bad it was edited...,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,1027,"['other', 'reviewers', 'stated', 'monster', 'vs.', 'mascot', 'show', 'completely', 'butchered', 'up', 'seemed', 'be', 'unanimous', 'favorite', 'also', 'favorite', 'episode', 'one', 'reasons', 'bought', 'DVD', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'foreward', 'seeing', 'Queerwig', 'Inoperable', 'Tumora', 'again', 'sadly', 'present', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'content', 'rest', 'episodes', 'are', 'extremely', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'episode', 'Takeshi', 'Castle', 'also', 'included', 'scenes', 'special', 'feature', 'commentary', 'sexual', 'ever', 'names', 'job', 'descriptions', 'participants', 'are', 'hilarious', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'guys', 'come', 'up', 'stuff', 'sure', 'great', '4', '5', 'stars', 'circumcised', 'version', 'monsters', 'vs.', 'mascots', 'still', ""'re"", 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'buy', '**Just', 'note', 'original', 'version', 'monsters', 'vs.', 'mascots', 'viewable', 'youtube', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'separate', 'sections', 'all', 'there', 'search']",N/A

The show is funny and yes the stunts might be unbelievable, but the contestants and announcers, voice actors bring something else to this show, fun.  There are some painful eliminations in here and all of that but nothing extraordinarily outrageous.  Its just a cool show to watch and enjoy.

While they made impovements on ""Kenny Blankenship's Top 25 Most Eliminations of the Season"" over the season one set, the ""Behind the Scenes of MXC leaves something to be desired as it doesn't really us how they put the show together (most of it is shows the voice actors in the recording room).
