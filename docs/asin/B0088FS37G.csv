The thrills and chills here are based on good writing, acting, and a plot that works, not some big budget explosion fest.

Hauser""","[0, 0]","I found this an effective little horror/suspense thriller about a group of friends who get together for innocent fun and find themselves in a Saw-like situation.  Who's hosting the fun and games?  Is it the cameraman obsessively videoing every moment, to the annoyance of all?  Or is it someone else?  The minister maybe?  Shades of Bunuel, with a nifty script and skilled ensemble acting.",3,"Yeah, I've been to this party",1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,389,"['found', 'effective', 'little', 'horror/suspense', 'thriller', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'get', 'together', 'innocent', 'fun', 'find', 'Saw-like', 'situation', 'Who', 'hosting', 'fun', 'games', 'cameraman', 'obsessively', 'videoing', 'moment', 'annoyance', 'someone', 'else', 'minister', 'maybe', 'Shades', 'Bunuel', 'nifty', 'script', 'skilled', 'ensemble', 'acting']",N/A
