It was not at all difficult. If you are looking for a advanced beginner tape, you might like it.  Also, The instructor adds some interesting pronunciations to her instructions.  I have taken many yoga classes in different cities, and have several different videos.  In all but this one, the pronunciations were the same. I found that quite distracting. Shiva Rea's yoga Shakti is great, as well as Christina Pederson's Vinyasa Flow on the beach. I would recommend them instead.",2,yoga girl,1226448000,"11 12, 2008",2008,596,"['was', 'disappointed', 'video', 'few', 'reasons', 'did', 'not', 'challenge', 'intermediate', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'student', 'was', 'not', 'difficult', 'are', 'looking', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'tape', 'might', 'like', 'Also', 'instructor', 'interesting', 'pronunciations', 'instructions', 'have', 'taken', 'many', 'yoga', 'classes', 'different', 'cities', 'have', 'several', 'different', 'videos', 'one', 'pronunciations', 'were', 'same', 'found', 'quite', 'distracting', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'yoga', 'Shakti', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'Christina', 'Pederson', 'Vinyasa', 'Flow', 'beach', 'would', 'recommend', 'instead']","Vinyasa Flow Yoga, Grace, Power, Surf, and Sunset, Intermediate & Advanced, a ***Practice ***"

Partly because its 90 mins and finding that sort of time is a stretch for me, and partly because bits of it move slowly. Having said that, the more I do it the more I like it, and taking your time is sometimes good. I was surprised to see that some don't think it's that advanced - I for one cannot do ""bird of paradise"" or the splits and there were several bound positions that she gave modifications for. The scenery is very nice (not that you get to watch it much). I felt very relaxed after doing it. I would have liked a couple of shorter routines as well for regular use, but I can just stop at any of several points & stretch so not a biggie really. It's a keeper for sure, and gives me something to aim for.

Maral is great, and her commentary is deep and interesting, peppered with mind-expanding metaphors. You have a few music choices and whether or not to have instruction. I personally find the first music choice to be fantastic.It's a good workout, but not too hard. The more challenging aspects of this disc include a long headstand--the longest I have seen with ""arta"" (bending your legs halfway down), mermaid, full splits, long holding of crow pose, coming into bird of paradise from bound angle, full 1 footed pigeon (an intense backbend), snail, and flying fish. One reviwer thought this was a beginner disc: I don't agree. However, there a slow and easy parts including leg stretches, and long holds on sownward dog.

The instructor is extremely good, the flow is of a moderate place, and it is a lengthy practice 95 minutes.  However there is a 7 minute meditation session and 5 or so minute savasana.  The poses are well sequenced and will work you out.  This is a great DVD if you have the time, skill, and the endurance to get through it.

1153054,AXZ085P4SPXVL,B0016A0T7W,"Just Breathe ""Just Breathe""","[2, 2]","I practiced yoga with this DVD this morning for the second time and thoroughly enjoyed it.  My favorite thing about this DVD is that it includes headstand and shoulderstand.  If I only do two poses per day, those are the two that I will do.  When I practice to most other DVDs I have to pause and do my headstand / shoulderstand practice, or add it on to the end.  In addition, I appreciate that it is headstand on forearms with a longer hold, vs many videos that only come into tripod headstand from prasarita padottonasana (spelling?).  She holds headstand for a couple minutes, which if you want to hold it longer you can just continue and back up the DVD when you are finished.The practice included appropriate counterpose and felt very balanced.  There are two women practicing to voice over.  One woman will occasionally show the less advanced version of the pose.  A couple of times I looked at the screen and they were moving a bit ahead of the instruction, but I tend to not look at the screen too much.  I love the option to have no music, as I prefer to practice without most of the time.The DVD description indicates that this is for intermediate and advanced students, which of course is very subjective.  Advanced yogis may feel it is easy while beginners may feel it is very advanced.  I would say that it is not for a beginner in any way as you should already have learned headstand and other advanced poses.  This DVD was described as a practice DVD and not an instructional DVD.  There is some binding in side angle pose and other non-beginner poses include bird of paradise, mermaid pose, and jump backs from bakasana (crow).  If you are a yogi that likes a fast paced sweaty practice filled with lots of arm balances and extremely advanced poses this may also not be your cup of tea.Honestly, I think that if you are an advanced practitioner it is good to always remember to keep the beginners mind.  I feel great benefit even from the most basic beginner level practices if I am focusing on alignment and remaining present with my breath.  It doesn't always have to be the most physically challenging practice in order to feel benefit.  I find that this DVD has a balance of challenging poses and simple poses to create a perfect balance of doing and undoing.  I will be using this DVD for years to come.",5,Beautiful balanced practice for intermediate yogis,1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,2325,"['practiced', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'morning', 'second', 'time', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'My', 'favorite', 'thing', 'DVD', 'headstand', 'shoulderstand', 'only', 'do', 'two', 'poses', 'day', 'are', 'two', 'will', 'do', 'When', 'practice', 'most', 'other', 'DVDs', 'have', 'pause', 'do', 'headstand', '/', 'shoulderstand', 'practice', 'add', 'end', 'addition', 'appreciate', 'headstand', 'forearms', 'longer', 'hold', 'vs', 'many', 'videos', 'only', 'come', 'tripod', 'headstand', 'prasarita', 'padottonasana', 'spelling', 'headstand', 'couple', 'minutes', 'want', 'hold', 'longer', 'can', 'just', 'continue', 'back', 'up', 'DVD', 'when', 'are', 'finished.The', 'practice', 'included', 'appropriate', 'counterpose', 'felt', 'very', 'balanced', 'are', 'two', 'women', 'practicing', 'voice', 'One', 'woman', 'will', 'occasionally', 'show', 'less', 'advanced', 'version', 'pose', 'couple', 'times', 'looked', 'screen', 'were', 'moving', 'bit', 'ahead', 'instruction', 'tend', 'not', 'look', 'screen', 'too', 'much', 'love', 'option', 'have', 'music', 'prefer', 'practice', 'most', 'time.The', 'DVD', 'description', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'students', 'course', 'very', 'subjective', 'Advanced', 'yogis', 'may', 'feel', 'easy', 'beginners', 'may', 'feel', 'very', 'advanced', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'beginner', 'way', 'should', 'already', 'have', 'learned', 'headstand', 'other', 'advanced', 'poses', 'DVD', 'was', 'described', 'practice', 'DVD', 'not', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'binding', 'side', 'angle', 'pose', 'other', 'non-beginner', 'poses', 'include', 'bird', 'paradise', 'mermaid', 'pose', 'jump', 'backs', 'bakasana', 'crow', 'are', 'yogi', 'fast', 'paced', 'sweaty', 'practice', 'filled', 'lots', 'arm', 'balances', 'extremely', 'advanced', 'poses', 'may', 'also', 'not', 'be', 'cup', 'tea.Honestly', 'think', 'are', 'advanced', 'practitioner', 'good', 'always', 'remember', 'keep', 'beginners', 'mind', 'feel', 'great', 'benefit', 'even', 'most', 'basic', 'beginner', 'level', 'practices', 'am', 'focusing', 'alignment', 'remaining', 'present', 'breath', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'be', 'most', 'physically', 'challenging', 'practice', 'order', 'feel', 'benefit', 'find', 'DVD', 'balance', 'challenging', 'poses', 'simple', 'poses', 'create', 'perfect', 'balance', 'doing', 'undoing', 'will', 'be', 'using', 'DVD', 'years', 'come']","Vinyasa Flow Yoga, Grace, Power, Surf, and Sunset, Intermediate & Advanced, a ***Practice ***"

As another reviewer said this dvd is a marathon not because of the number of poses but the long holds of the poses.  It starts out with a 7 minute meditation. Next is sun salute 5x each a & b with variations on b using crow pose to jump into plank; hands clasped behind back to plank pose.  Other poses are triangle, side angle to bird of paradise, head stand, gomasana arms, pyramid pose, revolved triangle, side stick variations, downward dog flip out to half or full upward bow, pigeon variations, half split, full split, locust, bow 2x, bridge, upward facing bow 3x, happy baby, hamstring stretch, side stretch, plow, shoulder stand, plow variation.  I may have missed a pose here or there but that's what you get.  The holds are looong.Overall  I loved this class.  There are no abs and no seated poses.
