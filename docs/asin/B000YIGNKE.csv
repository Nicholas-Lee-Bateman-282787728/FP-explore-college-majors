1120021,A39039L9YEE0UC,B000YIGNKE,,"[0, 0]","I liked this version better than the 1995 version.  I watched this one soon after watching the other version and noticed immediately that this one has a more serious feel to it.  Through the camera work, lighting, music, and probably through the way the actors set their moods also, the director emphasized that Anne missing her chance at being happy was serious; that it had dominated her life for years and that it always would.  The movie communicated her overwhelming sadness very well.  In one early scene showing Anne writing a letter where we hear the narration of it, for example, she looks directly at the camera for several seconds so as to say, ""so you see what this is like and what it has meant to me?  You understand?""  The movie forces you to realize how heartbreaking it would be for Anne to have missed her chance and to have never forgotten the guy, and to see how long that feeling had gone on.  This work early on sets up the viewer to sense the joy of what happened later more fully.And I liked the scene at the end with her running through the streets.  Not realizing that it wasn't in the book, since I haven't read it, I was free to enjoy it.  The scene says that she knew absolutely what she wanted now and wasn't going to be persuaded differently again, and that she was now willing to break any and all rules of propriety for the sake of grabbing hold of love.  She wasn't going to miss it again for anything.  Also, as a male I can say that I'd be much more likely to be crazy about this Anne than the other one.",4,The great sadness,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,1540,"['liked', 'version', 'better', '1995', 'version', 'watched', 'one', 'soon', 'watching', 'other', 'version', 'noticed', 'immediately', 'one', 'more', 'serious', 'feel', 'camera', 'work', 'lighting', 'music', 'probably', 'way', 'actors', 'set', 'moods', 'also', 'director', 'emphasized', 'Anne', 'missing', 'chance', 'being', 'happy', 'was', 'serious', 'had', 'dominated', 'life', 'years', 'always', 'would', 'movie', 'communicated', 'overwhelming', 'sadness', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'early', 'scene', 'showing', 'Anne', 'writing', 'letter', 'where', 'hear', 'narration', 'example', 'directly', 'camera', 'several', 'seconds', 'so', 'say', 'so', 'see', 'what', 'like', 'what', 'meant', 'understand', 'movie', 'forces', 'realize', 'how', 'heartbreaking', 'would', 'be', 'Anne', 'have', 'missed', 'chance', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'guy', 'see', 'how', 'long', 'feeling', 'had', 'gone', 'work', 'early', 'sets', 'up', 'viewer', 'sense', 'joy', 'what', 'happened', 'later', 'more', 'fully.And', 'liked', 'scene', 'end', 'running', 'streets', 'Not', 'realizing', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'was', 'free', 'enjoy', 'scene', 'knew', 'absolutely', 'what', 'wanted', 'now', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'persuaded', 'differently', 'again', 'was', 'now', 'willing', 'break', 'rules', 'propriety', 'sake', 'grabbing', 'hold', 'love', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'miss', 'again', 'anything', 'Also', 'male', 'can', 'say', ""'d"", 'be', 'much', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'crazy', 'Anne', 'other', 'one']",N/A

1120025,A3MVP7SFPH2XSW,B000YIGNKE,,"[0, 1]","And this one is not to mine.Persuasion is such a beautiful book, and the 1995 adaptation so true to it in spirit, mood, rhythm and plot, that it was hard to imagine why we needed another. But of course there will always be another Austen adaptation - we have Pride and Prejudices, Emmas and Sense and Sensibilities coming out our ears.  And in another 5 or 10 years we'll have a new round, with the next generation of young actors.  So be it - Shakespeare never gets old either.This adaptation has all the right costumes, locations (ah Lyme, ah Bath) and superficial manners (we bow our heads politely) but that's about it. To compress the plot into 90 minutes much was left out, rearranged, or invented. Instead of the exquisite scene where Wentworth overhears Anne speaking to Harville, she tells him directly that she's not engaged to Mr. Elliot, and then (as so many have already said) chases him all around Bath.Rupert Penry-Jones may be a good actor, but here he's just used for his chiseled, if bland, good looks. He has two facial expressions: pained, and 'in-love'. We don't see Wentworth's humor and good spirits, his intelligence, or even much of the rapport between him and Anne as it reestablishes itself over the course of the story.Hawkins - just, no. Her mouth quivers and gapes, she weeps, she staggers and sighs - this is not Anne Elliot, this is not any Austen heroine. It's a stereotypical bereft maiden. The final kissing scenes were so dreadful I had to literally turn away from the screen.The other characters are stereotypes too, with no nuance. Elizabeth is screechy, Sir Walter is shouty, Mrs. Clay is simpery, Mary is whiny, Benwick is gloomy, and so on - everyone has one broadly drawn characteristic.Just one woman's opinion.

1120027,A1O9Y2UGUNWFZA,B000YIGNKE,,"[0, 1]","I have read some of the other reviews concerning this version and I must say that I agree with some of them almost exactly. The casting was good, the settings were great, the main points of the book were covered but the final scenes drug the possible great film downwards.*POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD* Perhaps the most romantic scene in the entire book is when Captain Wentworth overhears Anne speaking with Harville about men versus women forgetting their loves. Wentworth writes her a beautiful letter while surrounded by people, then goes back into the room after leaving to make sure Anne knows it is there and hers. The scene is dramatic in the sense Frederick finally expresses his feelings while in addition there is the fear of Wentworth being discovered writing a letter to Anne. In this film version, the audience has no idea where the letter is written or what exactly provoked him to write it. It was almost as if the production crew filmed everything else and realized, ""Oh yeah, we forgot the letter...let's paste that in somehow."" I also read elsewhere someone asking why Anne would be running about Bath the way she did. It seemed very out of character for Anne Elliot to be running all around looking for Wentworth.This film was better than some of the newest BBC adaptations of Jane Austen, however as far as ""Persuasion"" goes, the 1995 film is the best one out there.

1120029,A2G1GCHGVUG98K,B000YIGNKE,,"[0, 1]","I rate this higher than ""Becoming Jane"" (3.5) just because it's ""Persuasion"", and the story is just fantastic - though Austen should get credit for it.  Overall, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't fantastic.  It was a far better effort in comparison to its 1990s predecessor than the 2005 ""Pride and Prejudice"" was to its 1990s counterpart.Sally Hawkins didn't do horribly, and she conveys the gentleness and patience of Anne Elliot well.  When she's happy to see Wentworth, you can tell the difference between her sadder moods, but I don't remember quite feeling Anne's despondency as much.  If Amanda Root hadn't gone before her, I doubt we'd all beat up on Hawkins as badly.  It's really  not a bad performance.So Rupert Penry-Jones is the finest looking Wentworth I've seen yet, though not the best Wentworth I've seen.  Like Hawkins, he's not bad; I loved how Penry-Jones played it when Wentworth sees Lady Russell again for the first time since she separated him and Anne.  Unfailingly polite, he does manage to convey the necessary emotions at the necessary parts.  His concern and slight panic when he discovers people expect him to offer for Louisa is well done.  Again, same problem; he was preceded by Ciaran Hinds, and it's a little bit like Macfayden attempting Darcy after Firth.No real opinion on the script...again, liked the inclusion of the conversation where Wentworth finds out that people expect him to offer for Louisa.  I have mixed feelings about how the writer moved the Benwick-Anne conversation about how men and women love: it fits where it is in the movie, but in the book it's a key factor in Wentworth's offering again for Anne at the end.  Anne running the ""streets of Bath"" marathon - CHEESY AND DUMB.Really liked Finlay Robertson's Benwick; I found him more memorable than Richard McCable's 1995 version.  This Benwick looked truly lovesick at the loss of his fiancee.  Alice Krige's Lady Russell was well done as well.  How she did the conversation where Lady Russell and Anne discuss Wentworth at the start of the movie was very good.  It's easy to believe that Lady Russell is really just looking out for Anne; Krige delivers all the maternal warmth while maintaining a regal bearing.  Hard to go wrong with Anthony Head as Sir Walter Elliot.Go with the 1995 if you only want to watch one, but this is worth watching.",3,"3.5, really",1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,2354,"['rate', 'higher', 'Becoming', 'Jane', '3.5', 'just', 'Persuasion', 'story', 'just', 'fantastic', 'Austen', 'should', 'get', 'credit', 'Overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'fantastic', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'effort', 'comparison', '1990s', 'predecessor', '2005', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'was', '1990s', 'counterpart.Sally', 'Hawkins', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'horribly', 'conveys', 'gentleness', 'patience', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'well', 'When', 'happy', 'see', 'Wentworth', 'can', 'tell', 'difference', 'sadder', 'moods', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'quite', 'feeling', 'Anne', 'despondency', 'as', 'much', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'had', ""n't"", 'gone', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'beat', 'up', 'Hawkins', 'badly', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'performance.So', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'finest', 'looking', 'Wentworth', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'not', 'best', 'Wentworth', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Hawkins', 'not', 'bad', 'loved', 'how', 'Penry-Jones', 'played', 'when', 'Wentworth', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'separated', 'Anne', 'Unfailingly', 'polite', 'manage', 'convey', 'necessary', 'emotions', 'necessary', 'parts', 'concern', 'slight', 'panic', 'when', 'people', 'expect', 'offer', 'Louisa', 'well', 'done', 'Again', 'same', 'problem', 'was', 'preceded', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'little', 'bit', 'Macfayden', 'attempting', 'Darcy', 'Firth.No', 'real', 'opinion', 'script', 'again', 'liked', 'inclusion', 'conversation', 'where', 'Wentworth', 'out', 'people', 'expect', 'offer', 'Louisa', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'how', 'writer', 'moved', 'Benwick-Anne', 'conversation', 'how', 'men', 'women', 'love', 'where', 'movie', 'book', 'key', 'factor', 'Wentworth', 'offering', 'again', 'Anne', 'end', 'Anne', 'running', 'streets', 'Bath', 'marathon', 'CHEESY', 'DUMB.Really', 'liked', 'Finlay', 'Robertson', 'Benwick', 'found', 'more', 'memorable', 'Richard', 'McCable', '1995', 'version', 'Benwick', 'looked', 'truly', 'lovesick', 'loss', 'fiancee', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'How', 'did', 'conversation', 'where', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'Anne', 'discuss', 'Wentworth', 'start', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'easy', 'believe', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'really', 'just', 'looking', 'out', 'Anne', 'Krige', 'maternal', 'warmth', 'maintaining', 'regal', 'bearing', 'Hard', 'go', 'wrong', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Elliot.Go', '1995', 'only', 'want', 'watch', 'one', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

I saw the movie three times and it was not a charm (twice with iTunes and once on Amazon).  I was very disappointed that I deleted the download.  I didn't believe that Hinds and Root were in love with each other and the pacing of the film was very slow.This 2007 version was a nice change.  The acting was believable.  I really liked Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins as a couple.  Sally isn't model gorgeous but real.  She is who I imagined when I read the book.  She looks ""homely"" with a faint past existence of possessing beauty.  Rupert is now my forth favorite Austen hero actor (Colin Firth, Jeremy Northam and Johnny Lee Miller my first three faves).I liked this version the most.  The characters were a lot more likeable and believable.  The pacing of the movie ran smoothly and wasn't boring.

1120033,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B000YIGNKE,,"[0, 2]","Though I've read most of the other novels by Jane Austin--my favorites beingPride And PrejudiceandSense and Sensibility (Barnes & Noble Classics Series) (B&N; Classics)--I've never readPersuasion.  I think that the descriptive statements that accompany the book have put me off for some reason in the past.  I was on an Austin kick, however, and decided to view a DVD of the novel.  I have to say that I'm much encouraged to read the book itself from what I've seen of the story.That said, however, I didn't feel that the film itself was exceptional.  Perhaps I've seen too many stellar cast versions of other Austin books.  The Emma Thompson version ofSense & Sensibility (Special Edition)with Huge Grant, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman and a totally amazing cast of British character actors and the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version ofPride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)would spoil any viewer for anything less.Rupert Penry-Jones was not as riveting as Fredrick Wentworth as one might have hoped.  He lacks the dark brooding and sometimes almost sinister character of an Austin romantic hero.  I suspect that his open face and blondness gave him too much of a pleasant ""guy next door"" air.  He gave a very masterful performance as the rejected lover while on horseback accompanying the heroine in her coach, but the stormy weather background and his costume had much to do with it.  One can't help feel that Victorian riding boots, panel fronted trousers, white linen cravats and a flowing cape would give most men the look of a romantic hero.  It's almost too bad they've given them up these days!Most of the female characters were very unremarkable, almost forgettable.  Sally Hawkins makes a very unprepossessing Anne Elliot.  Her Anne seems to revel in the martyrdom of spinsterhood like a sullen 19 year old.  Instead of being a beautiful woman of great dignity and poise who has chosen to remain unmarried rather than marry someone other than the love of her life, she seems dumpy. Emma Thompson's Ms Dashwood as the practical mainstay of her own natal family is far less frumpy and moody.  When Anne descends the stair in what looks like a gown made from the living room drapes we are doubtlessly intended to contrast this with her sister's fine ball gown and see that Anne is the epitomy of the sensible woman.  Instead we feel like she's attempting a ""poor little me"" routine to gain sympathy. Part of this is the attempted shorthand of the film.  We're meant to understand her through her costume.  It didn't work.Jennifer Higham as Louisa Musgrove is almost annoying.  Though she doesn't look it, she acts like a girl of 13 or 14 who has a crush on a handsome ""older"" neighbor and who has yet to decide if she wants to be a little girl and play or an adult and court.  She just comes across as totally inappropriate.  It is hardly surprising that Captain Wentworth is shocked to discover he has inadvertently ""committed himself"" to this playful child.  It would be like Edward Ferrars finding himself engaged by accident to the youngest Dashwood sister Margaret because they played tag and swords on the manor grounds!  What the character did do well was to feed information to the audience about Anne.  By contrasting the quiet, unassuming and practical Anne with the light weight antics of Ms Muscove, we see why the hero might have returned after eight years for a second chance.Probably the greatest missed chance was Julia Davis' Elizabeth Elliot.  So much more could have been made of her character than was.  I could almost see a performance akin to that of Harriet Walter's Fanny Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility or Juliet Stevenson's Mrs. Elton in Emma. These characters did so much to illuminate the lives and personalities of their respective heroines, they almost carried the story.  That's what they're supposed to do.  Almost all Austin characters are there to further the story and provide the reader with information.  Had the director made better use of Elizabeth's behavior as favorite daughter and debutant, more of Anne's personality and place in her family would have been apparent.  Certainly Amanda Hale's neurotic presentation of Mary Elliot Musgrove did a great deal to further the audience's understanding of Anne and her situtation.A good story, but only a fair film because not everything that could have been done with the characters was.",3,Too any missed chances with supporting characters,1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,4396,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'most', 'other', 'novels', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'favorites', 'beingPride', 'PrejudiceandSense', 'Sensibility', 'Barnes', 'Noble', 'Classics', 'Series', 'B', 'N', 'Classics', ""'ve"", 'never', 'readPersuasion', 'think', 'descriptive', 'statements', 'accompany', 'book', 'have', 'put', 'off', 'reason', 'past', 'was', 'Austin', 'kick', 'however', 'decided', 'view', 'DVD', 'novel', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'much', 'encouraged', 'read', 'book', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'story.That', 'said', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'was', 'exceptional', 'Perhaps', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'stellar', 'cast', 'versions', 'other', 'Austin', 'books', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'version', 'ofSense', 'Sensibility', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Huge', 'Grant', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'totally', 'amazing', 'cast', 'British', 'character', 'actors', 'Colin', 'Firth/Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'version', 'ofPride', 'Prejudice', 'Special', 'Edition', 'A', 'E', '1996', 'would', 'spoil', 'viewer', 'anything', 'less.Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'riveting', 'Fredrick', 'Wentworth', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'hoped', 'dark', 'brooding', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'sinister', 'character', 'Austin', 'romantic', 'hero', 'suspect', 'open', 'face', 'blondness', 'gave', 'too', 'much', 'pleasant', 'guy', 'next', 'door', 'air', 'gave', 'very', 'masterful', 'performance', 'rejected', 'lover', 'horseback', 'accompanying', 'heroine', 'coach', 'stormy', 'weather', 'background', 'costume', 'had', 'much', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'Victorian', 'riding', 'boots', 'panel', 'fronted', 'trousers', 'white', 'linen', 'cravats', 'flowing', 'cape', 'would', 'give', 'most', 'men', 'look', 'romantic', 'hero', 'almost', 'too', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'given', 'days', 'Most', 'female', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'unremarkable', 'almost', 'forgettable', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'very', 'unprepossessing', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'Anne', 'revel', 'martyrdom', 'spinsterhood', 'sullen', '19', 'year', 'old', 'Instead', 'being', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'great', 'dignity', 'poise', 'who', 'chosen', 'remain', 'unmarried', 'rather', 'marry', 'someone', 'other', 'love', 'life', 'dumpy', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Ms', 'Dashwood', 'practical', 'mainstay', 'own', 'natal', 'family', 'far', 'less', 'frumpy', 'moody', 'When', 'Anne', 'stair', 'what', 'gown', 'made', 'living', 'room', 'are', 'doubtlessly', 'intended', 'contrast', 'sister', 'fine', 'ball', 'gown', 'see', 'Anne', 'epitomy', 'sensible', 'woman', 'Instead', 'feel', 'attempting', 'poor', 'little', 'routine', 'gain', 'sympathy', 'Part', 'attempted', 'shorthand', 'film', ""'re"", 'meant', 'understand', 'costume', 'did', ""n't"", 'work.Jennifer', 'Higham', 'Louisa', 'Musgrove', 'almost', 'annoying', ""n't"", 'look', 'girl', '13', '14', 'who', 'crush', 'handsome', 'older', 'neighbor', 'who', 'yet', 'decide', 'be', 'little', 'girl', 'play', 'adult', 'court', 'just', 'across', 'totally', 'inappropriate', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'shocked', 'discover', 'inadvertently', 'committed', 'playful', 'child', 'would', 'be', 'Edward', 'Ferrars', 'finding', 'engaged', 'accident', 'youngest', 'Dashwood', 'sister', 'Margaret', 'played', 'tag', 'swords', 'manor', 'grounds', 'What', 'character', 'did', 'do', 'well', 'was', 'feed', 'information', 'audience', 'Anne', 'contrasting', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'practical', 'Anne', 'light', 'weight', 'antics', 'Ms', 'Muscove', 'see', 'why', 'hero', 'might', 'have', 'returned', 'eight', 'years', 'second', 'chance.Probably', 'greatest', 'missed', 'chance', 'was', 'Julia', 'Davis', 'Elizabeth', 'Elliot', 'So', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'character', 'was', 'could', 'almost', 'see', 'performance', 'akin', 'Harriet', 'Walter', 'Fanny', 'Dashwood', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'Mrs.', 'Elton', 'Emma', 'characters', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'illuminate', 'lives', 'personalities', 'respective', 'heroines', 'almost', 'carried', 'story', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'do', 'Almost', 'Austin', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'further', 'story', 'provide', 'reader', 'information', 'Had', 'director', 'made', 'better', 'use', 'Elizabeth', 'behavior', 'favorite', 'daughter', 'debutant', 'more', 'Anne', 'personality', 'place', 'family', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'apparent', 'Certainly', 'Amanda', 'Hale', 'neurotic', 'presentation', 'Mary', 'Elliot', 'Musgrove', 'did', 'great', 'deal', 'further', 'audience', 'understanding', 'Anne', 'situtation.A', 'good', 'story', 'only', 'fair', 'film', 'not', 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'characters', 'was']",N/A

I love it.However for a 21st Century audience the prior adaptations are simply too slow paced, oblique, and period bound to fully hold their attention. Here Simon Burke (the screenplay adapter) has done a masterful job of speeding the pace and unraveling the understated underlying emotions motivations and thoughts of the main characters (Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot in particular) without compromising the intent of the source novel.Even though I know the story intimately I was on pins and needles throughout. At times the suspense was nearly unbearable. As a result, this is now my favorite screen version of this classic novel.As to the imbalanced reviews of my fellow Jane Austen aficionados who ravaged this production simply because it fails to tightly adhere to the original manuscripts of our most beloved 19th Century Authoress - and to borrow from William Shatner's entreaty to similarly obsessed Star Trek fans - I  would simply say, ""Get a life!""Frankly the elitist, exclusive attitude of those in the ""purist"" camp of Jane Austen fandom is wearing thin.  The works of other classic authors (Shakespeare, Dickens, the Bront sisters, etc.) have been reinterpreted throughout the ages for stage and film to make the work more relevant to their contemporary audience so I'm puzzled as to why the fans of Austen felt that her work would somehow be exempted.

So I'll compare both to this.I liked Anne better in this than the 1995, but not by much; Sally Hawkins is perhaps a little nicer to look at, and doesn't bug her eyes as much as Amanda Root, but still is a little too flustered all the time.Neither films' Capt. Wentworth were really great, neither seemed to quite fit the character.No one can beat Sophie Thompson's Mary, you can't even compare the two performances.Anne's elder sister Elizabeth is supposed to be beautiful; she's not in this film. 1995's Elizabeth is somewhat better.Charles Musgrove, Sir Elliot, and Mr. Elliot are adequate, though I prefer Charles in the 1995 better.The set and costumes are fresher in this adaptation, though occasionally Anne's dress's are a little too shabby. One the whole, both sets and costumes are better in this version.The music is beautiful, and goes well with the film's overall tone. Martin Phipps did a wonderful job.It's impossible to review an adaptation of a book without commenting on the faithfulness to the novel; that said, I must have a word about the four major scenes that strayed.  First, Anne's conversation with Capt. Harville on the faithfulness of men and women which originally is at the close of the novel and prompts Capt. Wentworth to write his letter to Anne; in the movie, it is moved to earlier in the film, and is between Anne and Capt. Benwick.  They would have done better to leave the sequence alone, as their meddling with it did not improve the story.  The second and worse stray is when Anne, after receiving Wentworth's letter, finds it necessary to run like a flustered hen about Bath in search of the author.  That scene is a negative on two accounts: first, it is NOT in the book. Second, it is highly unlikely that a woman of high status and in that era would ever do anything so undignified. The third and fourth unlikely scenes are 1) Anne and Capt. Wentworth's kiss, which was in my opinion gross, and a thing that they would NOT have done in the middle of a busy street, and 2) Capt. Wentworth's buying Kellynch Hall; also unlikely, and also not in the book.To  close, this movie may be more appealing, have an attractive cast, and a good pace, but if you want faithfulness to the book, go for the 1995 version. Though slow, and not attractive to all, it is very faithful to the book, and will appeal to Austen/Persuasion purists more than this.",3,"Not Great, Not Awful",1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,2471,"['watching', 'movie', 'had', 'previously', 'read', 'book', 'watched', '1995', 'version', 'So', ""'ll"", 'compare', 'this.I', 'liked', 'Anne', 'better', '1995', 'not', 'much', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'perhaps', 'little', 'nicer', 'look', ""n't"", 'bug', 'eyes', 'as', 'much', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'still', 'little', 'too', 'flustered', 'time.Neither', 'films', 'Capt', 'Wentworth', 'were', 'really', 'great', 'neither', 'seemed', 'quite', 'fit', 'character.No', 'one', 'can', 'beat', 'Sophie', 'Thompson', 'Mary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'compare', 'two', 'performances.Anne', 'elder', 'sister', 'Elizabeth', 'supposed', 'be', 'beautiful', 'not', 'film', '1995', 'Elizabeth', 'somewhat', 'better.Charles', 'Musgrove', 'Sir', 'Elliot', 'Mr.', 'Elliot', 'are', 'adequate', 'prefer', 'Charles', '1995', 'better.The', 'set', 'costumes', 'are', 'fresher', 'adaptation', 'occasionally', 'Anne', 'dress', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'shabby', 'One', 'whole', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'better', 'version.The', 'music', 'beautiful', 'well', 'film', 'overall', 'tone', 'Martin', 'Phipps', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job.It', 'impossible', 'review', 'adaptation', 'book', 'commenting', 'faithfulness', 'novel', 'said', 'must', 'have', 'word', 'four', 'major', 'scenes', 'strayed', 'First', 'Anne', 'conversation', 'Capt', 'Harville', 'faithfulness', 'men', 'women', 'originally', 'close', 'novel', 'prompts', 'Capt', 'Wentworth', 'write', 'letter', 'Anne', 'movie', 'moved', 'earlier', 'film', 'Anne', 'Capt', 'Benwick', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'leave', 'sequence', 'alone', 'meddling', 'did', 'not', 'improve', 'story', 'second', 'worse', 'stray', 'when', 'Anne', 'receiving', 'Wentworth', 'letter', 'necessary', 'run', 'flustered', 'hen', 'Bath', 'search', 'author', 'scene', 'negative', 'two', 'accounts', 'first', 'NOT', 'book', 'Second', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'woman', 'high', 'status', 'era', 'would', 'ever', 'do', 'anything', 'so', 'undignified', 'third', 'fourth', 'unlikely', 'scenes', 'are', '1', 'Anne', 'Capt', 'Wentworth', 'kiss', 'was', 'opinion', 'gross', 'thing', 'would', 'NOT', 'have', 'done', 'middle', 'busy', 'street', '2', 'Capt', 'Wentworth', 'buying', 'Kellynch', 'Hall', 'also', 'unlikely', 'also', 'not', 'book.To', 'close', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'appealing', 'have', 'attractive', 'cast', 'good', 'pace', 'want', 'faithfulness', 'book', 'go', '1995', 'version', 'slow', 'not', 'attractive', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', 'will', 'appeal', 'Austen/Persuasion', 'more']",N/A

But, she never stopped loving Mr. Wentworth, and she zealously followed his heroic career in the Royal Navy. And now, eight years later, when her family falls on hard times and are forced to rent out their home, she finds herself thrown together with the now rich young Captain Wentworth. However, Captain Wentworth was quite hurt by Anne&#8217;s rejection of him, and as such they are doomed to never be together again, right?This made-for-television movie was created by ITV in the United Kingdom as part of their Jane Austen Season, and was received with scathing reviews. So, what went wrong? The main characters, Anne Elliot (Sally Hawkins) and Captain Wentworth (Rupert Penry-Jones), do a good job at their roles, but just cannot carry the weight of the entire movie on their backs.The biggest problem was the way Jane Austen&#8217;s excellent story was hacked up to make the story fit into a 90 minute production. Throughout watching it, I had to keep pausing the DVD, so that I could explain to my wife what was happening and why. A good part of the story was replaced with a strange scene where Anne Elliot makes a mad dash around the city of Bath. I am afraid that I could not even begin to explain it to my wife, as I didn&#8217;t understand it myself!So, overall, I did find this to be an inadequate production of Persuasion.

1120050,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B000YIGNKE,,"[1, 1]","This 2007 BBC version of ""Persuasion"" first aired in the United States in January 2008 on PBS Masterpiece Theater.  Starring Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot and Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Frederick Wentworth, it retells Jane Austen's classic romance about two people with a once and future love.The story is familiar to Jane Austen fans.  Anne Elliot, daughter of a baronet, was persuaded at age nineteen to reject the marriage proposal of Navy Lieutenant Frederick Wentworth on the grounds that he lacked fortune.  Eight years later and still single, Anne  bitterly regrets her decision.  As her family departs its ancestral home to economize in smaller quarters in Bath, she learns that the new tenants are to be an Admiral and Mrs Croft.  Mrs Croft's brother, now-Captain Wentworth, has returned from the Napoleonic Wars wealthy with prize money and in search of a wife.Anne is repeatedly thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, who seems interested in her two young and eligible cousins.  An accident to one of the cousins at the seaside town of Lyme causes Wentworth to take renewed notice of Anne.  Anne will be favored by the surprising courtship of an wealthy cousin, setting the stage for one last opportunity to make the right choice.Compared with its 1995 predecessor starring Amanda Root and Ciaron Hinds, the 2007 version is shorter by a good ten minutes and has shaved the details of the storyline accordingly.  Anne's courtship by her cousin, and her relationships with her old school teacher in Bath are much abbreviated.  The climactic scene in the 1995 version, in which Anne defends women's constancy to Wentworth's mentor in the presence of Wentworth, is here played as a note sent by Wentworth that causes Anne to run breathlessly through the rainy streets of Bath to find him.The 2008 version features an attractive cast and equally attractive location shooting. Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones have good chemistry as the two leads.  Hawkins is less stoic and more emotionally vulnerable in her portrayal than Amanda Root's much put-upon Anne.  The handsome Penry-Jones looks rather unweathered for eight years at sea, but is easily worthy of Anne's longheld love.  Anthony Stewart Head is marvellous as Anne's vain and pompous father.""Persuasion"" is well recommended to fans of Jane Austen, who should find it entertaining and well-executed if taken on its own terms.",4,"A little more ""Persuasion,"" please...",1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,2399,"['2007', 'BBC', 'version', 'Persuasion', 'first', 'aired', 'United', 'States', 'January', '2008', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'Starring', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'Captain', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'classic', 'romance', 'two', 'people', 'once', 'future', 'love.The', 'story', 'familiar', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fans', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'daughter', 'baronet', 'was', 'persuaded', 'age', 'nineteen', 'reject', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'Navy', 'Lieutenant', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'grounds', 'lacked', 'fortune', 'Eight', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'single', 'Anne', 'bitterly', 'decision', 'family', 'ancestral', 'home', 'economize', 'smaller', 'quarters', 'Bath', 'new', 'tenants', 'are', 'be', 'Admiral', 'Mrs', 'Croft', 'Mrs', 'Croft', 'brother', 'now-Captain', 'Wentworth', 'returned', 'Napoleonic', 'Wars', 'wealthy', 'prize', 'money', 'search', 'wife.Anne', 'repeatedly', 'thrown', 'company', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'who', 'interested', 'two', 'young', 'eligible', 'cousins', 'accident', 'one', 'cousins', 'seaside', 'town', 'Lyme', 'Wentworth', 'take', 'renewed', 'notice', 'Anne', 'Anne', 'will', 'be', 'favored', 'surprising', 'courtship', 'wealthy', 'cousin', 'setting', 'stage', 'one', 'last', 'opportunity', 'make', 'right', 'choice.Compared', '1995', 'predecessor', 'starring', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Ciaron', 'Hinds', '2007', 'version', 'shorter', 'good', 'ten', 'minutes', 'shaved', 'details', 'storyline', 'accordingly', 'Anne', 'courtship', 'cousin', 'relationships', 'old', 'school', 'teacher', 'Bath', 'are', 'much', 'abbreviated', 'climactic', 'scene', '1995', 'version', 'Anne', 'women', 'constancy', 'Wentworth', 'mentor', 'presence', 'Wentworth', 'here', 'played', 'note', 'sent', 'Wentworth', 'Anne', 'run', 'breathlessly', 'rainy', 'streets', 'Bath', 'find', 'him.The', '2008', 'version', 'attractive', 'cast', 'equally', 'attractive', 'location', 'shooting', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'Hawkins', 'less', 'stoic', 'more', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'portrayal', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'much', 'put-upon', 'Anne', 'handsome', 'Penry-Jones', 'rather', 'unweathered', 'eight', 'years', 'sea', 'easily', 'worthy', 'Anne', 'longheld', 'love', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'marvellous', 'Anne', 'vain', 'pompous', 'father', 'Persuasion', 'well', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'who', 'should', 'find', 'entertaining', 'well-executed', 'taken', 'own', 'terms']",N/A

This film did not make the best possible use of the talents of the actors cast, and it changed the story so that it doesn't make sense anymore.RP-J was given nothing to do but smolder.  Amanda Hale's Mary was positively dreadful; she looked as if she was trying to channel Sophie Thompson and she did not succeed.  Sally Hawkins is, frankly, not attractive enough for Anne.  And, before you think I'm being shallow, I should point out that Austen's Anne is described as being a very pretty girl.  Sophy Croft is only supposed to be 8 years older than her brother Frederick, but she looks more like his aunt or his mother here.The scene where Wentworth picks Anne up and plops her on the back of the Crofts' gig misses the point.  In the book, Anne's (and ours) reaction to that is to think that, perhaps, he still cares for her somewhat.  In this movie, it looks like he wants nothing at all to do with her.The ""Bath Marathon"" at the end of the film was ludicrous. The fish-mouthed kiss was disgusting.  Wentworth buying Kellynch Hall for Anne is impossible (William Elliot will inherit it).  And what is with Mrs. Smith running along side Anne?  Mrs. Smith is an invalid.  Is Nurse Rooke a miracle worker?But moving the constancy conversation from Bath to Lyme and having it be between Anne and Benwick is the biggest mistake the filmmakers made.  This change makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Wentworth is meant to hear that conversation.  It is the impetus for him to write his letter to Anne.  The first line of that letter is ""I can listen no longer in silence...""  So moving that conversation and preventing Wentworth from hearing it ruins the letter.  How they can justify ruining one of the most beautiful love letters in all of English literature is beyond me.The book is beautiful and romantic.

1120057,A17W36X7XYEG0N,B000YIGNKE,,"[12, 18]","Having seen the 1995 version and read the book, I thought this version would be worthy and even taped it! Was I ever wrong! If you've read the book, which I highly recommend, and see the 1995 movie, then you would see everything wrong with this drivel! I was disappointed. I suppose the casting and costumes were acceptable, but no where in the book does Anne go off and pour out her heart into some journal like some forlorn teenager. And I don't recall her being a clutz either. I don't remember her tripping in the book. In the book and in the 1995 version which got it right the first time, Anne is strong, capable, and more than worthy of any man's affection. In this one she comes off as a pathetic old maid pining away for her man. Of course, I missed the part where Frederick is writing her the letter and hands it her. Where's the swoon value in taking it out? The climax is that letter. It's a love letter to her. She's running around like some celebrity stalker chasing after him and is so out of breath I expected her to collapse at any moment. I hated this! I wouldn't waste my money on it. There's no hateful sister who would rather leave her sister to walk in the rain, nor is her snobbish buffoon of a father who is played by Anthony Head. I kept expecting Buffy to leap out at any moment. I'm not a purist, but I do like faithful adaptations of a great book. Even Louisa's fall from the wall is kept out. It's shortened here and reveals nothing about Louisa's character. I recommend the 1995 version.

Since I had not read the book, nor had seen the 1995 version with Amanda Root I really had nothing to compare it to.The novel follows the story of Anne Elliot, the daughter of a rather, poor baronet who has completely mismanaged his money since the death of his wife.  Mr Elliot is a very interesting character, he is so self-important and snobbish and provides alot of comic entertainment throughout the novel.  When the movie opens, Anne is arranging for their home to be let out while the family moves to Bath in order to try and save some money.  Anne learns that the family coming to stay in their home is the sister of the man she fell in love with years ago who asked her to marry him but whom she eventually turned, down because at the time she was persuaded that he had no money to really offer her.  From this point Anne and Captain Frederick Wentworth eventually meet and we get to watch and see if the couple can ever move forward from the past and find their way back to each other. I really liked it then, I thought the way it was filmed with allowing us personal glimpses into Sally Hawkins's thoughts and feelings created a unique relationship between her and the audience. I thought that Rupert Penry-Jones was an excellent Captain Frederick Wentworth, extremely handsome, cold and still hurt by Anne Elliot's decision despite the fact that time has moved on. I also loved the film locations and cotumes.  Lyme is so beautiful and those scenes are really classic.After seeing this movie, I purchased the book to read and found myself a bit disappointed with the movie version.  Though I still think that the casting of Sally Hawkins and Captain Wentworth was excellent and I do believe that they portrayed their parts accurately, I was a little saddened by the way the movie ends.  It is completely different from the book and even though before I'd read the book I liked it, now I know that the original ending is much better.  It is so dramatic and much more emotional, especially for Austen.  It makes the ending of the movie, with Anne running through the streets of Bath seem rather stupid and silly.

All the subtlties and emotions of an Austen novel take time to draw out, and when I saw that this version of Persuasion was 90 minutes I was so shocked I thought it had to have a second part. Instead I got rushed scenes that were telling a story without much of a sense of what was going on. The early scenes where Anne and Captin Wentworth meet are so short that there's little chance for the viewer to feel the intensity of the emotions, the sense of longing and loss, instead just as you get it, they'e on to another important part and you get wiplash. Their walk through the woods was just odd to me, again while reading the book I remember there being an intensity and it felt long and drawn out, but the scene just moves along, suddenly Anne falls and then the climax where Caption Wentworth singles Anne out as needing a carriage ride seems so unimportant that you wouldn't creidt it as a sign of his caring about Anne.I agree with everyone that the last 10 minutes are bad, but what bothers me is not so much the running, as the list of odd couinsdences, it's rather Dickonsonian, just as Wentworth comes to see Anne, the whole family arrives, and just as Anne is running to find Wentworth her friend comes up and tells her some news (which is no longer relevent to the story) and just as she's going somewhere else she runs into someone else, I just didn't believe any of it. Of course in order to fit a novel that takes days to absorb into 90 minutes it's I guess the best you can do.------- But wait, while I am not going to recant anything I have said I would like to edit my review, because I have watched this film again, and realized it's not that bad.  First off a movie can not really be so bad if every time it's on tv you flip over and watch it. I have to admit that I must be a but of a snob to have written the above, because this movie is watchable and enjoyable, and of all the Persuasion's I have seen it is the one that creates the best romantic tension between Anne and Wentworth. I have come to really enjoy watching this movie. Now that does not mean I don't lament as we relocate to Bath and the whole thing gets shot to hell, Jane crafted such a beautiful ending and whoever wrote or directed this realized they were running out of time and clearly said, we need to rush this up a ton, and slaughtered Jane's work. I cannot get over that, and tend to flip away once all the running starts, but forgetting that, this is a delightful and romantic movie and you should watch it already.",3,Not Good - But Not that Bad,1267315200,"02 28, 2010",2010,2652,"['gold', 'standard', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'books', 'movies', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'version', 'P', 'P', 'part', 'credit', 'length', 'movie', 'subtlties', 'emotions', 'Austen', 'novel', 'take', 'time', 'draw', 'out', 'when', 'saw', 'version', 'Persuasion', 'was', '90', 'minutes', 'was', 'so', 'shocked', 'thought', 'had', 'have', 'second', 'part', 'Instead', 'got', 'rushed', 'scenes', 'were', 'telling', 'story', 'much', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'early', 'scenes', 'where', 'Anne', 'Captin', 'Wentworth', 'meet', 'are', 'so', 'short', 'little', 'chance', 'viewer', 'feel', 'intensity', 'emotions', 'sense', 'longing', 'loss', 'instead', 'just', 'get', ""'"", 'e', 'important', 'part', 'get', 'wiplash', 'walk', 'woods', 'was', 'just', 'odd', 'again', 'reading', 'book', 'remember', 'being', 'intensity', 'felt', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'scene', 'just', 'along', 'suddenly', 'Anne', 'falls', 'then', 'climax', 'where', 'Caption', 'Wentworth', 'singles', 'Anne', 'out', 'needing', 'carriage', 'ride', 'so', 'unimportant', 'would', ""n't"", 'creidt', 'sign', 'caring', 'Anne.I', 'agree', 'everyone', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'are', 'bad', 'what', 'bothers', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'running', 'list', 'odd', 'couinsdences', 'rather', 'Dickonsonian', 'just', 'Wentworth', 'see', 'Anne', 'whole', 'family', 'just', 'Anne', 'running', 'find', 'Wentworth', 'friend', 'up', 'news', 'longer', 'relevent', 'story', 'just', 'going', 'somewhere', 'else', 'someone', 'else', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'course', 'order', 'fit', 'novel', 'days', 'absorb', '90', 'minutes', 'guess', 'best', 'can', 'do.', 'wait', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'recant', 'anything', 'have', 'said', 'would', 'like', 'edit', 'review', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'again', 'realized', 'not', 'bad', 'First', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'time', 'tv', 'flip', 'watch', 'have', 'admit', 'must', 'be', 'snob', 'have', 'written', 'above', 'movie', 'watchable', 'enjoyable', 'Persuasion', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'best', 'romantic', 'tension', 'Anne', 'Wentworth', 'have', 'come', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie', 'Now', 'not', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'lament', 'relocate', 'Bath', 'whole', 'thing', 'shot', 'hell', 'Jane', 'crafted', 'beautiful', 'ending', 'whoever', 'wrote', 'directed', 'realized', 'were', 'running', 'out', 'time', 'clearly', 'said', 'need', 'rush', 'up', 'ton', 'slaughtered', 'Jane', 'work', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'tend', 'flip', 'away', 'once', 'running', 'forgetting', 'delightful', 'romantic', 'movie', 'should', 'watch', 'already']",N/A

1120069,A3T0A0NM8636JW,B000YIGNKE,,"[1, 4]","This is the WORST adaptation I've ever seen of an Austen book ( and I have seen a lot ), but I did find myself enjoying it - for the wrong reasons. It was so ridiculous and far fetched I just had to lough, and by the end of the movie my husband and I  were laughing so hard we almost fell out of bed. And also The actor who plays Capt. Wentworth is so very hot.Persuasion is Austen's last novel, publishes after her death in 1817. It tells the story of Anne Eliott, A heroine not so young or beautiful any more. At the age of 27, Anne is considered, by that time standards, to be an old spinster  (remember, Elizabeth Bennet from ""pride and prejudice"" was 19 and her sister Lydia Eloped at the tender age of 15 !!!!). Having lost her youth and beauty and with no prospects of ever marrying , Anne is quietly resigned to spending the rest of her life taking care of her self centered father and sisters. Though They are unappreciative of her, and often mistreat her, Anne is  a strong  person  and manages to live her life with dignity and courage.  Her quiet existence is completely shaken by a the return of Capt. Wentworth, whom she turned down 9 years ago, following advice from her friend, who thought he is not socially and financially suitable. Wentworth is a naval officer who has returned from the war with fortune. Now he's successful, wealthy and considered a very suitable match, and is sought after by every young eligible woman in sight. Anne finds herself in the dangerous situation where hopes and dreams she thought are long gone and forgotten awaken in her, but Capt. Wentworth is unforgiving and cold. As the story unfolds we discover that Wentworth's coldness is just a front to disguise the hurt he still carries from being turned down by Anne, and that he could not forget her.So much for the novel - and on to the adaptation: The script, the casting, the acting, everything was so off. Nothing made sense and nothing was there to support the narrative of the romance between Wentworth and Anne. The production's hair stylist and costume designer should have won an Oscar if there was an Oscar for  ""most unattractive and unflattering costume"" and ""The ugliest hair style in recorded history"" for their treatment of poor Anne. You can see that a lot of effort was put into turning the actress, Sally Hawkins, from an attractive young woman to a person past her prime who pays no attention to herself. But no effort is evident on the side of the writers to provide us with even a clue as to why Wentworth would fall in love with her in the first place, and why he would love her still, after all the hurt she caused him. In the ( MUCH BETTER ) 1995 BBC adaptation of PersuasionPersuasion [HD] we see how loyal, kind, and loving Anne is.  We see how she takes care of everyone in her family ( though they are ungrateful and unworthy of her ) how she quietly and efficiently runs her father's household, takes care of her hypochondriac and spoiled sister and does it all with a smile, and we understand why others, including Wentworth, would hold her in high esteem..But here - the writers simply cut everything out, we are left with a woman in ugly clothes and and hair who is also dull, uninteresting and has the personality of a door mat. It seems that she spends most of her time whimpering and pathetically crying into her diary.  Now this woman had dumped the most handsome and dashing officer in the whole wide British navy because he had no money.9 years later he shows up, still dashing but now also wealthy. She regrets dumping him, well -DUH, but why would HE even give her a second look?Smoking Wentworth stirs a lot of excitement among all the unmarried woman and  they all compete for his attention.  This is when it started to be so bad I had to laugh - on a stroll one of wenthworth's Admirers, Louisa, is flirting with Wentworth and is jumping into his arms calling ""catch me"" ,until he fails to catch her and she falls and suffers a severe head injury. This bit is indeed in the book -  but when you see how it plays out in the movie it's simply hilarious. Instead of being a tragic mishap , you watch how Louisa simply hurls herself down from a great height and you wonder if the head injury was there BEFORE she fell.Everyone is worried about Louisa and the accident accept for Wentworth: on a conversation with a friend he is surprised to find out he was courting Louisa. I should think their flirting should have tipped him off. He reveals that he  did not intend to propose to her as everyone thinks, and now he is more worried about people's expectations , rather than for her recovery. You get the notion that he  regrets she survived her idiotic accident, because if she lives he's obliged  to marry her, if he wants to or not  -  how comic.  The friend advices him to put some distance between himself and poor brain damaged Louisa, and he accepts in order to diminish any thoughts about marriage.He confesses he still loves Anne - which would be a huge shock if we did not read the novel, because up until this point he did not seem to notice her existence ( and who would blame him ).  Ciaran Hinds played Wentworth so beautifully in the previous adaptation: he gave a very nuanced and convincing performance so you can tell he still cares deeply for Anne while he is PRETENDING not to notice her. She had hurt his feelings and his pride and he is working hard to suppress his love. Here Rupert penry Jones as Wentworth simply goes from totally ignoring her and flirting with another woman to dumping the other woman in her hour of need because he's madly in love with Anne.  Totally unbelievable. I can't even understand how people who have not read the novel or seen the other adaptation are supposed to understand what the hell is going on. Everything is so hasty and inexplicable.The script carries on to be even more rushed and unconvincing from now on, so much of the plot and the conversations was edited out. If it hadn't been for the comic moments this movie provided, I would have turned it off by now.  It's a good thing I didn't  - because the most comical moment of all is still yet to come - the scene in which Anne is running all over Bath trying to find Wentworth. Beside the fact that running around in the streets was a behaviour  that was totally unbecoming of a lady and poor Austen would have stabbed the directors and writers had she been alive to see her heroine disgraced so, Anne is clearly in a very bad shape. By the time she finds him she is breathing heavily and panting and you half expect her to drop down dead. Despite  his confessed  undying love for her, Wentworth seems to be detached and unimpressed with her effort to find him. You would expect him to take her in his arms, or at least bring her a glass of water, but he seems mostly put off, Perhaps because she is too sweaty after her long jog . Their first kiss is weird, I guess they were going for a shy, hesitant kiss, as PDA were frowned upon back then, but again Wentworth gives the vibe like he is NOT so interested in kissing her, and that he would have prefered to wait until she showered first.",2,So ridiculously bad It was actually very amusing,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,7140,"['WORST', 'adaptation', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen',

1120076,A31J176KH7ZZEY,B000YIGNKE,,"[2, 3]","I'm a big Jane Austen fan. Jane Austen is my favorite author of all time. If I had to travel back in time, she would be near the top of my list of people I would like to meet and have a conversation with. I relate to the fact that Jane Austen never got married. I relate to the fact that she had a bond with her sister. I relate to the fact that she loved writing. I could watch any Jane Austen adapted version or themed movie a hundred times and never get tired. The same goes to leaving my TV on Masterpiece Theatre. Maybe I was a British woman in one of my past lives. I just love watching British period films. Anyways, this is my favorite film version of ""Persuasion"", and I've seen every single Jane Austen film out there. I always cry each time I see this version. Sally Hawkins is such a great actress and she does an excellent job as Anne Elliot. I really relate to this storyline. I've had boyfriends in my life, and I've always been the good, loyal, honest, trustworthy girlfriend, but I can honestly and genuinely say that I never experienced being deeply and passionately in love with someone. I'm 37, and I've never been in love with a man or told a guy that I was in love with him. To tell a guy that I was in love with him would be a major deal for me. And I've never ever done that because I don't take saying things like that lightly. There was one guy who I think had the potential for me to have those feelings for the first time but I think my current health problems scared him away. I think of Julia Roberts and Javier Bardem in the ""Eat, Pray, Love"" movie. I think Javier's character says to Julia's character, ""You don't need a lover, you need a champion."" When he said that, I thought to myself, ""Word!"" It's going to take a champion of a man to take on me when it comes to love. Anyways, I think Jane Austen books and films fill that void when it comes to the romance department for me. When I watch this film, I really relate to Sally Hawkins' potrayal of Anne. If I was in love with a guy, I would totally be like Anne. This movie has a great cast, but I think this film is excellent because of Sally Hawkins. I found myself feeling my heart racing and being emotional because of Sally Hawkins' portrayal of Anne. And I liked the way that this movie ended.

1120077,A3REQ22WG9LV99,B000YIGNKE,,"[2, 3]","Many viewers, this one included, will be comparing this film to the 1995 Amanda Root version, which has long been one of my favorites among the Austen films. And the earlier version is more faithful to the novel, which, like all the Jane Austens, tends to be stiff and emotionally dry. This newer adaptation rises above those limitations and brings the drama to life. Sally Hawkins delivers a blow-away preformance as the late twenties spinster torn between a bad decision she's pressured to live with and the passionate love she still feels. The director (Shergold) must have realized early on what he had in terms of Sally's transcendent abilities for this role. It's hard to believe the original screenplay is the one we see. It's easy to imagine Shergold responding to the early rushes by revising his film plan and sending the writers back to work. If that's what happened--and we can only speculate--then we need to be grateful that he did. The directing is obviously tailored in a special way to Sally's exquisitely emotional portrayal.Much criticism in these reviews has been aimed at the climactic running scene. Purists complain that it is not in the book and contrary to Regency norms. But every filmmaker should try to improve upon the original book. Would anyone really want him to do less? This filmaker clearly succeeds in improving upon the Austen novel. That the running scene mildly breaks with social norms is the very point of it. This is a woman who, at last, is being given a second chance, and it turbocharges her actions to grasping the opportunity she never thought she'd have. Her turbulent, action-oriented closing on triumph satisfies in a way the novels never do. It is the running scene that catapults this adaptation to one of the best love stories ever committed to film.

This version, however, is absolutely horrible. Many of the more recent (made in the 2000's) BBC adaptations to Austen novels have been more... artsy than previous interpretations of the novels, and to date I've enjoyed them. Sense and Sensibility was really well done, the older version of Emma was better but the 2000 one was still good. But Persuasion is where they drop the ball. This is more of an art film than it is a period piece and was almost painful to sit through. I found myself so bored at some points that I would think back to how the 1995 version did it and compare them just to keep occupied. There are so many over played emotions that are lost to the plot because the cameraman was given too much artistic liberty and you get lost in the angles and lenses instead of the plot and characters, and not in the good way.All I can say is that, if you have watched this film and haven't seen the version with Amanda Root as Anne, go watch it.

1120083,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000YIGNKE,,"[2, 3]","Several years ago, Anne Elliot (Sally Hawkins) received a proposal of marriage from young naval officer Frederick Wentworth (Rupert Penry-Jones).  With very little to offer Anne in the way of money or property, she was persuaded by her family members and closest confidante, Lady Russell, to turn Frederick down.  Now, eight years later, Frederick has returned a rich man with half of the women in the county falling at his feet - and Anne has lived to bitterly regret her decision.Jane Austen's final-completed novel, PERSUASION, is one of her most mature and pragmatic works.  She cleverly plays with the pre-established pattern of her earlier stories by having the characters already in complete possession of their feelings for one another. In ""Persuasion"", the love story has already taken place but failed, and the challenge now is how to bring the lovers back together again.The BBC's 1995 film of ""Persuasion"" (starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds) is a great favourite for many (although I've never completely warmed to it), but this latest 2007 attempt - originally part of a new season of Jane Austen adaptations for ITV - gives a refreshing new interpretation on the story.  I appreciate the efforts of Simon Burke of trying to give the character of Anne something of a backbone (this is especially evident in the final scene where Anne runs through the streets of Bath after having read Frederick's letter).Sally Hawkins is fast-establishing herself as one of the new ""go-to"" leading ladies of British period drama (after ""Fingersmith"" and ""Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky"").  Her Anne is a delightful creature, very sympathetic but also with a great deal of comedy.  I adored the casual scenes between Anne and Wentworth - and Rupert Penry-Jones gives Ciaran Hinds a good run for his money in the handsome and dashing stakes.The performances are strong right down the line - producers went for some very interesting casting choices, including comedienne Julia Davis (""Nighty Night"") and Amanda Hale as Anne's sisters Elizabeth and Mary; Anthony Head (""Merlin"") as Sir Walter Elliot, Alice Krige as Lady Russell; and Stella Gonet (""The House of Eliott"") as Mrs Musgrove.",4,"""Too late... too late I began to understand myself and her...""",1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,2190,"['Several', 'years', 'ago', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'received', 'proposal', 'marriage', 'young', 'naval', 'officer', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'very', 'little', 'offer', 'Anne', 'way', 'money', 'property', 'was', 'persuaded', 'family', 'members', 'closest', 'confidante', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'turn', 'Frederick', 'down', 'Now', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'Frederick', 'returned', 'rich', 'man', 'half', 'women', 'county', 'falling', 'feet', 'Anne', 'lived', 'bitterly', 'regret', 'decision.Jane', 'Austen', 'final-completed', 'novel', 'PERSUASION', 'one', 'most', 'mature', 'pragmatic', 'works', 'cleverly', 'plays', 'pre-established', 'pattern', 'earlier', 'stories', 'having', 'characters', 'already', 'complete', 'possession', 'feelings', 'one', 'Persuasion', 'love', 'story', 'already', 'taken', 'place', 'failed', 'challenge', 'now', 'how', 'bring', 'lovers', 'back', 'together', 'again.The', 'BBC', '1995', 'film', 'Persuasion', 'starring', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'great', 'favourite', 'many', ""'ve"", 'never', 'completely', 'warmed', 'latest', '2007', 'attempt', 'originally', 'part', 'new', 'season', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'adaptations', 'ITV', 'refreshing', 'new', 'interpretation', 'story', 'appreciate', 'efforts', 'Simon', 'Burke', 'trying', 'give', 'character', 'Anne', 'something', 'backbone', 'especially', 'evident', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'Anne', 'streets', 'Bath', 'having', 'read', 'Frederick', 'letter', '.Sally', 'Hawkins', 'fast-establishing', 'one', 'new', 'go-to', 'leading', 'ladies', 'British', 'period', 'drama', 'Fingersmith', 'Twenty', 'Thousand', 'Streets', 'Sky', 'Anne', 'delightful', 'creature', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'comedy', 'adored', 'casual', 'scenes', 'Anne', 'Wentworth', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'Ciaran', 'good', 'run', 'money', 'handsome', 'dashing', 'stakes.The', 'performances', 'are', 'strong', 'right', 'line', 'producers', 'went', 'very', 'interesting', 'casting', 'choices', 'including', 'comedienne', 'Julia', 'Davis', 'Nighty', 'Night', 'Amanda', 'Hale', 'Anne', 'sisters', 'Elizabeth', 'Mary', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'Merlin', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Elliot', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'Stella', 'Gonet', 'House', 'Eliott', 'Mrs', 'Musgrove']",N/A

Penry-Jones puts in an excellent performance throughout. But Sally Hawkin's performance is just breathtaking; she carries the whole movie to something much better than what we have a right to expect from these production values. Indeed, this is one of those rare instances in film when an actress gives a performance so riveting that it's hard to see how she or anyone else could have improved upon it. Bravo.In looking over these reviews, I see there are two camps on the screenplay and its departure from the original novel.

1120086,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B000YIGNKE,,"[2, 3]","this is not the first film adaptation of this novel but i believe it is the best.  what was done was to rev up the romance so that it could finally hold its own with PRIDE & PREJUDICE. The first thing it did right was to finally get a leading man who would make our hearts beat faster.  oh, yes rupert penry-jones certainly did that. i've seen him on other UK shows like the criminal WHITECHAPEL and the spy based MI5. but it is this film which gives him romantic gravitas.  if you were a fan of Colin Firth as Darcy, you are about to become a fan of Penry-Jones as Wentworth. i think every single jane austen novel has needed a romantically persuasive leading man for its film adaptation to work.  this is not to say that the female is unimportant as this adaptation also has the best actress doing the role.  but my belief is that the critical casting job has to be the leading man.  if he doesn't set our hearts aflutter, forget the whole project.Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root did an earlier version. Hinds as Wentworth did not set my heart aflutter at all.

1120087,A1LV6LMUHV3DNS,B000YIGNKE,,"[25, 35]","In seven years of conservative government and culture, one venue I thought would remain unchanged was Masterpiece Theatre.  Since the late 1960's this PBS program has entertained Americans with film renditions of the classics like ""War and Peace"" and popular literature like ""The Forsyte Saga"".  We have had to endure however some very mediocre programming these last years and interminable reruns.  I had great hopes for tonight.  However, the change in the introductory format of this incredible and most popular event should have been the warning to avoid what was coming next.  Gillian Anderson, of X-Files fame, is no Alistair Cooke.  And tonights premiere of a new version of ""Persuasion"" is not persuasive.  Of anything. Frankly, Penry-Jones as the Captain, on leave, of a multi-gun warship is not persuasive.  Sally Hawkins as the girl who turned him down years before is not persuasive. Alice Krige as the overly influential godmother is not persuasive.  This production fails.  Country squires do not have the vast estates, carriages and horses, and retinues of Baronets and Earls as portrayed here.  Virginal ladies of the years between England's wars with Napolean DID NOT play Beethoven on the piano; he was considered most radical at that time and most unsuitable for wellbred and innocent ears. Naval men did not wear civvies all the time during this period.  And candlelight never had the brightness of 100 watt blubs so evident nearly throughout this film.  It is almost as if the producers and directors took their version of Austen's ""Persuasion"" from a Readers Digest abridged edition.  Hawkins is so anemic one wonders what Captain Wentworth ever saw in the girl.  Penry-Jones is so ""soft"", one wonders if this Wentworth could command anything.  Anne Eliot's hypochondriac sister, overplayed here, is so tiresome anyone, including myself, would drown the woman.  The family she has married into in Austen's novel is supposed to be on a lower social scale; being a family of gentleman farmers.  But in this film their home and possessions rival the aristocratic Eliots'.  Bit of an oops there, I think.  As for the bad boy cousin Eliot who has found favor again with his family?  Austen portrays him as an elegant and hanesome if superficial and conniving man.  There was none of that present in the actor chosen for this version.  If this premiere is an example of what we can continue to expect from PBS, thank goodness there are DVD's of better versions of Persuasion and DVD's and VHS tapes of the wonderful dramas and comedys from all the years PBS, Masterpiece Theatre, and Mystery can proud of and nearly all of them can be purchased right here at [...].  Considering that the newer directors and board members of PBS and CPB include people from very culturally rich and diverse backgrounds I am stunned even more at tonight's poor showing.  After all, they do decide what we see.  I thought the days of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" being redone as a moralistic tale of the evils of prostitution and syphillis, first shown on PBS in 2005, and other such interpretive horrors were long gone.  There may be little or no moralizing in tonight's new film of ""Persuasion"".  But, in truth, there was not much of anything to recommend it either, in light especially of two earlier versions either of which are so very much better in every way.",1,Don't bother; watch the 1990's or even the 1970's version instead!,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,3358,"['seven', 'years', 'conservative', 'government', 'culture', 'one', 'venue', 'thought', 'would', 'remain', 'unchanged', 'was', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'late', '1960', 'PBS', 'program', 'entertained', 'Americans', 'film', 'renditions', 'classics', 'War', 'Peace', 'popular', 'literature', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'have', 'had', 'endure', 'however', 'very', 'mediocre', 'programming', 'last', 'years', 'interminable', 'reruns', 'had', 'great', 'hopes', 'tonight', 'However', 'change', 'introductory', 'format', 'incredible', 'most', 'popular', 'event', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'warning', 'avoid', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'next', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'X-Files', 'fame', 'Alistair', 'Cooke', 'tonights', 'premiere', 'new', 'version', 'Persuasion', 'not', 'persuasive', 'anything', 'Frankly', 'Penry-Jones', 'Captain', 'leave', 'multi-gun', 'warship', 'not', 'persuasive', 'Sally', 'girl', 'who', 'turned', 'down', 'years', 'before', 'not', 'persuasive', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'overly', 'influential', 'godmother', 'not', 'persuasive', 'production', 'Country', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'vast', 'estates', 'carriages', 'horses', 'retinues', 'Baronets', 'Earls', 'portrayed', 'here', 'Virginal', 'ladies', 'years', 'England', 'wars', 'Napolean', 'DID', 'NOT', 'play', 'Beethoven', 'piano', 'was', 'considered', 'most', 'radical', 'time', 'most', 'unsuitable', 'wellbred', 'innocent', 'ears', 'Naval', 'men', 'did', 'not', 'wear', 'civvies', 'time', 'period', 'candlelight', 'never', 'had', 'brightness', '100', 'watt', 'blubs', 'so', 'evident', 'nearly', 'film', 'almost', 'producers', 'directors', 'took', 'version', 'Austen', 'Persuasion', 'Readers', 'Digest', 'abridged', 'edition', 'Hawkins', 'so', 'anemic', 'one', 'what', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'ever', 'saw', 'girl', 'Penry-Jones', 'so', 'soft', 'one', 'wonders', 'Wentworth', 'could', 'command', 'anything', 'Anne', 'Eliot', 'hypochondriac', 'sister', 'overplayed', 'here', 'so', 'tiresome', 'anyone', 'including', 'would', 'drown', 'woman', 'family', 'married', 'Austen', 'novel', 'supposed', 'be', 'lower', 'social', 'scale', 'being', 'family', 'gentleman', 'farmers', 'film', 'home', 'possessions', 'rival', 'aristocratic', 'Eliots', 'Bit', 'oops', 'there', 'think', 'bad', 'boy', 'cousin', 'Eliot', 'who', 'found', 'favor', 'again', 'family', 'Austen', 'elegant', 'hanesome', 'superficial', 'conniving', 'man', 'was', 'none', 'present', 'actor', 'chosen', 'version', 'premiere', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'continue', 'expect', 'PBS', 'thank', 'goodness', 'are', 'DVD', 'better', 'versions', 'Persuasion', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'wonderful', 'dramas', 'comedys', 'years', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'Mystery', 'can', 'proud', 'nearly', 'can', 'be', 'purchased', 'right', 'here', '[', ']', 'Considering', 'newer', 'directors', 'board', 'members', 'PBS', 'CPB', 'include', 'people', 'very', 'culturally', 'rich', 'diverse', 'backgrounds', 'am', 'stunned', 'even', 'more', 'tonight', 'poor', 'showing', 'do', 'decide', 'what', 'see', 'thought', 'days', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'being', 'redone', 'moralistic', 'tale', 'evils', 'prostitution', 'syphillis', 'first', 'shown', 'PBS', '2005', 'other', 'such', 'interpretive', 'horrors', 'were', 'long', 'gone', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'moralizing', 'tonight', 'new', 'film', 'Persuasion', 'truth', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'anything', 'recommend', 'either', 'light', 'especially', 'two', 'earlier', 'versions', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'better', 'way']",N/A

Mary is silly and lacks the overweening need to be the center of attention and class consciousness. This version lacked those elements that made Mary stand out as an illustration of class consciousness.2.  I adore Anthony Head but I did not think him well suited to play the Baronet. There was none of the mincing foppishness that characterizes the Baronet in the book. Instead Head is angry all the time.3.  Anne would never run around Bath without a wrap and hat after the captain nor would she be so emotional. Anne controlled herself throughout everything, except when she stopped the captain to ask if he wouldn't stay for the concert.

I love the story but have never been altogether happy with the 1995 version staring Amanda Root. I found her portrayal of Anne Elliot a little lacking - perhaps because of age as one other reviewer notes. I liked Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth but found the majority of the other characters not up to my expectations. Overall, that version always seems to me a little flat.I am sorry to say that this new adaptation did not do much better. I was very disappointed with the way that essential scenes were altered and I felt that the story was overall too rushed. I wish they had allowed themselves another 20-30 minutes to give enough time for the story to develop or found away to make it work within the 90 minutes they had. I am not opposed to Rupert Penry-Jones as Wentworth - he is dashing and offers a good portrayal for the most part. I can't say I was as impressed with Sally Hawkins. There was something a little awkward about her. I didn't think she was a bad Anne Elliot - just not quite what I expected. I agree with one of the other reviewers assessments of her sisters - Mary is unnecessarily irritating - at times she was too comically overdone - and Elizabeth is not attractive at all.Finally - although the setting and score were very well done, some of the camera work was off-putting.

Anyone familiar with the work -any Austen fan, in particular- knows the missing parts.  But.  First, I know they have to run the titles, but there seems to be an endless scene of Anne wandering through Kellynch hall taking inventory.  It took up time, but did zilch to move the plot forward.  The actors were quite believable and for once were as described in the book and were of the correct age onscreen. Costuming and sets were superb; filming in Bath was brilliant.  There was some serious tweaking of incident and motives, but Austen is much like Shakespeare in that it is the basic plot and the dialogue that carries the play.  But the ending . . .  a daughter, even the middle daughter, of a baronet would not be running around the streets of Bath.  There is no way she would answer to anyone calling her by her Christian name, much less stand in a public street hatless and disheveled.  And an unmarried woman to kiss a man in the public square? Puh-lease!  In case anyone has missed the point, it was once an important part of the marriage ceremony (remember that quaint charming custom?) wwhen the minister would say, ""You may now kiss the bride.""

1120114,A2U549OUP6XJ1B,B000YIGNKE,,"[3, 5]","It's been a while since I watched this TV adaptation of Jane Austen's last (and maybe more personal) novel, ""Persuasion"".And I watched it last night, I fell in love with it all over again!First of all, the story is absolutely breathtaking. Jane Austen wrote it when she was dying, so the novel became a kind of race against time. But the style is really fantastic. The story is about 2 people , Anne Elliot and Captain Frederick Wentworth, who unexpectedly meet again after being separated for eight years. Eight years ago, Anne and Wentworth fell deeply in love with each other (""there were no two hearts so open"") but as Wentworth had no money and nothing to recommand himself, Anne's father and Lady Russel, Anne's deceased mother's friend, persuaded Anne to refuse his proposal, on account of Anne being too young and of Wentworth being pennyless.The story starts in this adaptation when Captain Wentworth successfully returns to the country from the war, having made a fortune in the Navy, with the intention of living peacefully and of finding a wife. They meet again unexpectedly when Anne's father, a heavy spender has to let the family house, Kellynch Hall, to the Crofts who happen to be closely related to Wentworth.Anne has never forgotten Wenworth and although she has received other proposals from elligible men, she is still unmarried at the age of 27 and still regrets having refused to marry Wentworth. He, on the other hand, shows he has never forgiven Anne and looks determined not to renew any kinds of relations with her...For me, this adaptation beautifully recreates this wonderful love story! Even if you are not convinced by the performances of some actors, the mere presence of the two leading actors, Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks) and Sally Hawkins (newcomer)is enough to make you fall for this new version. They are simply fantastic. Sally Hawkins is perfect to me as Anne Elliot! I like the idea that we are in Anne's head and all the film is based on her point of view. I think the director and the producers have managed to keep the spirit of the book as we can have a glimpse of Anne's inner world and share her pain, her hopes and what she thinks of the people around her. Sally Hawkins has a very mesmerizing voice. It is impossible not to feel moved by her in some way. The camera revolves around her and seems to reinforce her solitude and her sadness. It also shows people from her point of view which might be disconcerting the first time we see the film as there are many close-ups of the actors. With Rupert Penry Jones, SH forms a very good-looking pair. There is such a chemistry between them that every scene with them is a delight for me.Rupert Penry Jones just takes my breath away. He embodies Captain Wentworth to the perfection. I know he looks young for the part but even in the book, it is mentioned that while Anne has lost her bloom, he hasn't changed much all these years. I don't how to explain it but every time he enters a room, he is utterly dashing, I can't help saying to myself 'God, he has so much class!'His big, blue eyes staring at Anne with cold anger are enough to make me shiver with delight. Another reviewer, Mim (I think), said that Wentworth was aware of Anne both in and out of her actual presence. And I agree with that. Rupert's acting gives me the impression that even when she 's not present, he can't help thinking about her. Even when there are many people around them, they are so ""aware"" of each other that you  can't help feeling the bond between them. The two of them are so good together that it's mesmerinzing to watch their scenes.The music is lovely, haunting and adds to the solitude of the heroine. The landscapes are worth noticing, of course.Yet, I admit that this TV film still has some flaws, mainly with the script. There is some nonsense in some lines (Louisa and Wentworth talking about Anne and Charles Musgrove) and two or three dialogues, especially the one with Anne saying that women love the longest, aren't placed at the right time. The ending feels too rushed, and although I actually enjoy the race scene and see the symbolism of that scene, the scenes or shall I say -moments- when Anne goes / runs after Wentworth are really too fast-paced!It also took me a long time to appreciate the performance of the other actors. But the more I watch this TV film, the more I enjoy the presence of all the actors.Despite these flaws, it is definitely a 'must see'. Just don't stop at one viewing. Even after three or four viewings, I realize that there are still many little details (about the symbolic of some scenes) that escaped my notice before. This adaptation is a romantic film for all generations! And maybe the two leading actors can entice you to read the novel or re-read it.",5,"I've watched it again and this adaptation still ""pierces my soul""!!",1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,4779,"['been', 'while', 'watched', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'last', 'maybe', 'more', 'personal', 'novel', 'Persuasion', '.And', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'fell', 'love', 'over', 'again', 'First', 'all', 'story', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'when', 'was', 'dying', 'novel', 'became', 'kind', 'race', 'time', 'style', 'really', 'fantastic', 'story', '2', 'people', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'Captain', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'meet', 'again', 'being', 'separated', 'eight', 'years', 'Eight', 'years', 'ago', 'Anne', 'Wentworth', 'fell', 'deeply', 'love', 'other', 'were', 'two', 'hearts', 'so', 'open', 'Wentworth', 'had', 'money', 'nothing', 'recommand', 'Anne', 'father', 'Lady', 'Russel', 'Anne', 'deceased', 'mother', 'friend', 'persuaded', 'Anne', 'refuse', 'proposal', 'account', 'Anne', 'being', 'too', 'young', 'Wentworth', 'being', 'pennyless.The', 'story', 'adaptation', 'when', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'successfully', 'country', 'war', 'having', 'made', 'fortune', 'Navy', 'intention', 'living', 'peacefully', 'finding', 'wife', 'meet', 'again', 'unexpectedly', 'when', 'Anne', 'father', 'heavy', 'spender', 'let', 'family', 'house', 'Kellynch', 'Hall', 'Crofts', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'closely', 'related', 'Wentworth.Anne', 'never', 'forgotten', 'Wenworth', 'received', 'other', 'proposals', 'elligible', 'men', 'still', 'unmarried', 'age', '27', 'still', 'regrets', 'having', 'refused', 'marry', 'Wentworth', 'other', 'hand', 'never', 'forgiven', 'Anne', 'determined', 'not', 'renew', 'kinds', 'relations', 'adaptation', 'beautifully', 'wonderful', 'love', 'story', 'Even', 'are', 'not', 'convinced', 'performances', 'actors', 'mere', 'presence', 'two', 'leading', 'actors', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'Spooks', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'newcomer', 'enough', 'make', 'fall', 'new', 'version', 'are', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'perfect', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'like', 'idea', 'are', 'Anne', 'head', 'film', 'based', 'point', 'view', 'think', 'director', 'producers', 'have', 'managed', 'keep', 'spirit', 'book', 'can', 'have', 'glimpse', 'Anne', 'inner', 'world', 'share', 'pain', 'hopes', 'what', 'people', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'very', 'mesmerizing', 'voice', 'impossible', 'not', 'feel', 'moved', 'way', 'camera', 'reinforce', 'solitude', 'sadness', 'also', 'people', 'point', 'view', 'might', 'be', 'disconcerting', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'close-ups', 'actors', 'Rupert', 'Penry', 'Jones', 'SH', 'very', 'good-looking', 'pair', 'such', 'chemistry', 'scene', 'delight', 'me.Rupert', 'Penry', 'Jones', 'just', 'breath', 'away', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'perfection', 'know', 'young', 'part', 'even', 'book', 'mentioned', 'Anne', 'lost', 'bloom', ""n't"", 'changed', 'much', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'how', 'explain', 'time', 'room', 'utterly', 'dashing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'saying', ""'God"", 'so', 'much', 'class', ""'His"", 'big', 'blue', 'eyes', 'staring', 'Anne', 'cold', 'anger', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'shiver', 'delight', 'reviewer', 'Mim', 'think', 'said', 'Wentworth', 'was', 'aware', 'Anne', 'actual', 'presence', 'agree', 'Rupert', 'acting', 'impression', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'present', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'Even', 'when', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'aware', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'bond', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'together', 'mesmerinzing', 'watch', 'scenes.The', 'music', 'lovely', 'haunting', 'solitude', 'heroine', 'landscapes', 'are', 'worth', 'noticing', 'course.Yet', 'admit', 'TV', 'film', 'still', 'flaws', 'mainly', 'script', 'nonsense', 'lines', 'Louisa', 'Wentworth', 'talking', 'Anne', 'Charles', 'Musgrove', 'two', 'three', 'dialogues', 'especially', 'one', 'Anne', 'saying', 'women', 'love', 'longest', 'are', ""n't"", 'placed', 'right', 'time', 'ending', 'feels', 'too', 'rushed', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'race', 'scene', 'see', 'symbolism', 'scene', 'scenes', 'shall', 'say', '-moments-', 'when', 'Anne', '/', 'runs', 'Wentworth', 'are', 'really', 'too', 'fast-paced', 'also', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'appreciate', 'performance', 'other', 'actors', 'more', 'watch', 'TV', 'film', 'more', 'enjoy', 'presence', 'actors.Despite', 'flaws', 'definitely', ""'must"", 'see', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'one', 'viewing', 'Even', 'three', 'four', 'viewings', 'realize', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'little', 'details', 'symbolic', 'scenes', 'escaped', 'notice', 'before', 'adaptation', 'romantic', 'film', 'generations', 'maybe', 'two', 'leading', 'actors', 'can', 'entice', 'read', 'novel', 're-read']",N/A

As I see her she is the original DIY Riot Grrrl who would give Kathleen Hanna a real run for her Rebel Girl money. I've read the books more times than I can think of; cut a wide swath through the literary criticism; read the few remaining letters Cassandra didn't see fit to burn, and have seen every movie adaption out there. And I agree with, I think it was EM Forester who said, ""Jane will get you out of a tight spot!""I am not excessively critical of Austen movie adaptations as I seem to enjoy them all; I just like some better than others. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth still ""own"" Pride and Prejudice in my humble opinion ... I think it will be awhile before those two are truly unseated from their respective roles of Lizzy Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. And although there is a lot of blather about Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds being too old to play Anne Elliot and Fredrick Wentworth I heartily disagree -- they contributed wonderful performances in their Persuasion version roles, supported by the absolutely fabulous character actors Sophie Thompson who played a hilarious sister Mary and Corin Redgrave who played an equally hilarious Sir Walter Elliot.It was with some reticence that I purchased the Sense and Sensibiity Collector Set ... but what the heck, I get three films focusing on Jane Austen, including the latest adaptation of Persuasion which is my favoriate Austen novel and an update of Sense and Sensibility thrown in for good measure.I am truly delighted by Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot and Rupert Penry-Jones who was every bit her equal as the upwardly mobile Fredrick Wentworth. It was also really cool to see Anthony Head post ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as the vapid, vain and mean! Sir Walter ... which is such a departure from his Giles-Buffy days. The only real complaint, albeit a picayune minor one at that, is Julia Davis, who plays Elizabeth Elliot, is wearing a really bad wig. This is a stunning adaptation and Simon Burke is to be heartily commended as is Rebecca Eaton who once again proves why she is ""The Master"" in Masterpiece Theatre!

I am however, a HUGE fan of Ms. Austen's works and the films based upon her works. And I'm a huge fan of the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.I LOVE this more recent version - and it may surpass the other in my heart. The main reason is that I believe that the choices made to give the viewer a clearer and deeper understanding of the backstory, past events, and other histories of other characters work tremendously well in emphasizing the pain that each of the leads is going through. For example, no matter how many times I'd seen the 1995 version I had NO idea that Anne had actually been engaged to Frederick and then broke it off. I merely thought that she'd let herself be courted and then refused him. It wasn't made clear. It is very clear in this newer version that guilt and pain that Anne carries is tied to her betrayal as well as why Frederick would try so desperately to ignore her and perhaps hurt her by courting [or giving the appearance of courting] for one for of the Musgrove girls.I also like seeing more of Frederick's side of things in conversations with his best friend Harvell. I like receiving a more descriptive insight just to the true character of William Elliot and his desire to be a baronet. I though that the 2 leads had fantastic chemistry and Anthony Head brought an interesting menace to his foppish role. Elizabeth Elliot was miscast - she was too old and not pretty enough. Why could they not find Rosamund Pike - who was so perfectly cast as Jane in the 2005 version of P&P;? She would have been wonderful I believe!****SPOILER ALERT!!****I know many have issues with the changes of the delivery of the letter, the conversation with Harvell and the constancy of men vs. women, as well as Anne desperately looking for Frederick. I however, do not. I loved the way they were handled in 1995 of course - but still enjoy and love how our lovers get together in the end. And while I understand that readers are shocked to see that they would show Anne - a lady of elegance - running down several streets; I think it only adds to the determination and passion that Anne is feeling for not letting her second chance at happiness slip away. In fact it added to their reconciliation for me - and brought me to tears. It is a huge moment for Anne. She is chasing after her future - freeing herself from the miserable life in which she thought she was due based upon her prior actions. She is showing the world that she completely willing to flaunt convention and follow her heart and mind rather than ever be led or persuaded against otherwise again. So bravo!Again - there are some changes. But I do not think the changes hurt the story - for me they do add to it.

I was confused in places when I watched for the first time the 1995 version of Persuasion with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root, but a second viewing clarified -- and I've watched and loved it many times since (however, I've mused that this version would have been even better than it already is had Andrew Davies written the screenplay).  I love to watch the subtle play of emotions on the characters' faces, which reveal the thoughts and feelings people of that era would never utter aloud.  I was so looking forward to watching Rupert Penry Jones' Captain Wentworth in this new rendition of Persuasion because I loved him in his small but memorable role in the excellent film, Charlotte Gray.

I would never for a moment believe that Penry Jones would be attracted to, never mind pine for, her.  I was also disappointed in Penry Jones' rather wooden performance (though I think he had the deck stacked against him by the screenplay and the way this film was shot).  I found the final scene of Hawkins running through the streets ridiculous and her way-too-long-lead-up-to-a-kiss with Wentworth contrived.  A second watch did not change my assessment of this film.  What most disturbed me about it and the other new film versions of the Austen novels released this season (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey, although I thought Northanger Abbey the best of the three; I haven't seen Sense and Sensibility or Emma yet) is that everything feels forced -- the action is too fast and ""choppy."" Sally Hawkins is plopped onto the back of the carriage like a sack of potatoes, versus the subtle caress of Ciaran Hinds' hands on Amanda Root's waist as he helps her into the carriage, followed by the embarrassed expression on her face as she looks back at him and as he turns away to hide the caring his action revealed.  Time and time again in the 1995 version, you can see the subtle emotions on the characters' faces because the camera lingers appropriately.  This is only one of countless moments of genuine feeling that is totally lacking in this new version.  Is it that we're losing in our increasingly fast-paced results-oriented world -- reflected in many current films -- the ability to let life and feeling unfold according to its own natural rhythms?  I was not persuaded that the characters in this new version were real at all.",1,I'm not persuaded...,1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,2564,"['Let', 'state', 'up', 'front', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novels', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'almost', 'version', 'novels', 'put', 'film', 'was', 'confused', 'places', 'when', 'watched', 'first', 'time', '1995', 'version', 'Persuasion', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'second', 'viewing', 'clarified', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'loved', 'many', 'times', 'however', ""'ve"", 'mused', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'already', 'had', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'written', 'screenplay', 'love', 'watch', 'subtle', 'play', 'emotions', 'characters', 'reveal', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'people', 'era', 'would', 'never', 'utter', 'aloud', 'was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'Rupert', 'Penry', 'Jones', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'new', 'rendition', 'Persuasion', 'loved', 'small', 'memorable', 'role', 'excellent', 'film', 'Charlotte', 'Gray', 'was', 'disappointed', 'entire', 'production', 'especially', 'casting', 'plain', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'would', 'never', 'moment', 'believe', 'Penry', 'Jones', 'would', 'be', 'attracted', 'never', 'mind', 'pine', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'Penry', 'Jones', 'rather', 'wooden', 'performance', 'think', 'had', 'deck', 'stacked', 'screenplay', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'found', 'final', 'scene', 'Hawkins', 'running', 'streets', 'ridiculous', 'way-too-long-lead-up-to-a-kiss', 'Wentworth', 'contrived', 'second', 'watch', 'did', 'not', 'change', 'assessment', 'film', 'What', 'most', 'disturbed', 'other', 'new', 'film', 'versions', 'Austen', 'novels', 'released', 'season', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'thought', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'best', 'three', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Emma', 'yet', 'everything', 'feels', 'forced', 'action', 'too', 'fast', 'choppy', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'plopped', 'back', 'carriage', 'sack', 'potatoes', 'subtle', 'caress', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'hands', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'waist', 'carriage', 'followed', 'embarrassed', 'expression', 'face', 'back', 'away', 'hide', 'caring', 'action', 'revealed', 'Time', 'time', 'again', '1995', 'version', 'can', 'see', 'subtle', 'emotions', 'characters', 'camera', 'appropriately', 'only', 'one', 'countless', 'moments', 'genuine', 'feeling', 'totally', 'lacking', 'new', 'version', ""'re"", 'losing', 'increasingly', 'fast-paced', 'results-oriented', 'world', 'reflected', 'many', 'current', 'films', 'ability', 'let', 'life', 'feeling', 'unfold', 'according', 'own', 'natural', 'rhythms', 'was', 'not', 'persuaded', 'characters', 'new', 'version', 'were', 'real']",N/A

When I heard about the new ITV version coming out in 2007, I had really high hopes and couldn't wait to see another spin on the story. And then it came out and I watched it and...let's just say, I was not impressed.I wanted to like it. I really did. I just watched this for the third time for the review. I was hoping that I would find more to like with each rewatch but unfortunately they had the opposite effect. I just found more things that I hated! What do I hate? Just the script, the cast, and the direction. So yeah, um...pretty much everything. Was there anything I liked about it? Well, the music was nice and the cinematography was pretty (aside from the overuse of shaky cam). And a couple of the side characters were well-acted. Hmm...that's about it!The adaptation suffers first of all from being too short. It just feels so truncated and rushed and so many of my favorite bits from the book were left out or just ruined. It didn't seem like the creators cared about the story at all. With only a couple exceptions, I hated the cast. I don't know if the actors or the writing or directing are to blame, but the performances left a lot to be desired. Everything just felt off. I tried not to compare it too much to the 1995 version and even though I couldn't help but do that at some points, I just hate this version on its own. Whatever you do, don't accuse me of disliking it only because of the 1995 version. While it certainly pales in comparison to that version, my hate stems from this just being a poor adaptation of the book, and a poor movie in itself.It had such potential but it was all wasted. In some parts it seemed like they were copying 1995, and in others it was as if they were trying too hard to be different. I just don't understand.

You enjoy attractive people, beautifully dressed, living their lives amid gorgeous surroundings.  Each scene looks as though it was taken from a painting by Gainsborough.  The 1995 version, which I own, is darker and more mundane, perhaps depicting the way that people of the time actually lived.This Wentworth, Rupert Penry-Jones, is more appealing than Ciaran Hinds in the 1995 version.  Hinds does a good, robust job portraying the character, but he's not particularly romantic and Penry-Jones is.The other characters in the story seemed more interesting and necessary in the 1995 version.  The two Marys stand out in both vehicles for being particularly annoying, but Sophie Thompson, Emma Thompson's sister, was more believable in 1995, while Amanda Hale's Mary in 2007 is enjoyable to watch, but more contrived.  And this being a small world, Corin Redgrave, who in 1995 played Ann's snobbish father was the brother of Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave.Amanda Root in 1995, in my opinion, looks like Ann.  Sally Hawkins playing the current heroine has an unattractive hair style, which you forget when she looks directly into the camera at key moments in a way that makes you connect with her.  The director, wisely, made use of her expressive eyes to make her more sympathetic.As others have mentioned, however, the rushed, pat ending, which is the writer's fault, ruins the show.

The first time I watched it, I was wondering what was going on with Wentworth, but he was a bit confused himself, and it all became clear in the end.  Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins were great in their individual roles and there was good chemistry between them, especially in the very last scene, which was not in the book, but which I absolutely loved.Also, this adaptation shows us in ""real time"" a few scenes that we only learn about at the end in the book.  This is a hard book to adapt, I think, because so much of the action is internal to the characters, so this change helped the story flow better for someone who hadn't yet read the book.Like many other reviewers, I am not a fan of the running around at the end, because it seemed so unrealistic for someone of Anne's class to have done at the time, but again, it did do a wonderful job of conveying the emotion of the moment.  I think if the BBC and PBS had just given the producers an extra ten minutes of running time to work with, this would have been wonderful.  Then, the role of Mrs. Smith and her relationship with William Elliot could have been made clearer and more important, and we could have seen more of the interaction between Anne and Wentworth at the end of the story.This adaptation did inspire me to watch the Amanda Root version (which I liked, but not quite as much as this one), and to read the book, which I loved.  It's now my favorite Austen book and Wentworth has replaced Darcy as my favorite romantic hero.If you are a purist, you may not like this adaptation much, but if you're willing to allow the screen writer a few liberties, or haven't read the book, you may find you really like this movie.",4,"Really like it despite its ""faults""",1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,2365,"['saw', 'adaptation', 'Austen', 'novel', 'Masterpiece', 'saw', '1995', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'version', 'read', 'book', 'fell', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'strength', 'attachment', 'circumstances', 'story', 'involved', 'emotionally', 'way', 'had', 'not', 'expected', 'Austen', 'novel', 'love', 'Austen', 'books', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Emma', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'are', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'less', 'affecting', 'one', 'is.This', 'adaptation', 'not', 'as', 'faithful', 'book', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'version', 'well', 'how', 'Anne', 'Wentworth', 'feel', 'how', 'feelings', 'change', 'story', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Wentworth', 'was', 'bit', 'confused', 'became', 'clear', 'end', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'were', 'great', 'individual', 'roles', 'was', 'good', 'chemistry', 'especially', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'not', 'book', 'absolutely', 'loved.Also', 'adaptation', 'real', 'time', 'few', 'scenes', 'only', 'learn', 'end', 'book', 'hard', 'book', 'adapt', 'think', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'internal', 'characters', 'change', 'helped', 'story', 'flow', 'better', 'someone', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'read', 'book.Like', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'running', 'around', 'end', 'seemed', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'someone', 'Anne', 'class', 'have', 'done', 'time', 'again', 'did', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'conveying', 'emotion', 'moment', 'think', 'BBC', 'PBS', 'had', 'just', 'given', 'producers', 'extra', 'ten', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'Then', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'relationship', 'William', 'Elliot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'clearer', 'more', 'important', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'interaction', 'Anne', 'Wentworth', 'end', 'story.This', 'adaptation', 'did', 'inspire', 'watch', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'version', 'liked', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'read', 'book', 'loved', 'now', 'favorite', 'Austen', 'book', 'Wentworth', 'replaced', 'Darcy', 'favorite', 'romantic', 'hero.If', 'are', 'purist', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'adaptation', 'much', ""'re"", 'willing', 'allow', 'screen', 'writer', 'few', 'liberties', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'may', 'find', 'really', 'movie']",N/A

1120144,A3Q65632Z2K95F,B000YIGNKE,James Goodwin,"[6, 6]","'Persuasion' ranks as one of my all-time favourite romances. It's an absolutely beautiful story of a woman, Anne, reluctantly turning her back on love, then being presented with a possible second chance years later. It's also a story of a man, Frederick, fighting his feelings for a woman, and slowly losing that fight.I've seen the 1995 adaptation on more than one occasion, and ultimately, I have to say that I prefer the 2007 edition. Don't get me wrong -- I do like the earlier version, but I love this one. Here are my primary reasons.1. The Sense of ConsequenceI think this version does a fantastic job of centralizing Anne's feelings. It truly conveys the effects of an old loss, and renewed pain. I very much enjoyed her occasional narration, which placed a good amount of focus on her emotions -- the regret, the longing, the pondering. This sense of consequence isn't just limited to the narration, though. It's present in every subtle look of undying love that Sally Hawkins (wonderfully cast) gives Rupert Penry-Jones. Her expressions constantly tell a story, being sorrowful at certain times, while bordering on hopeful at others. Likewise, I also enjoyed Rupert's presentation of Captain Wentworth's pain. Seeing Anne again has brought him to a state of constant restraint and false apathy. Yet all the while, little hints of his true feelings begin to escape him. Of course, there's also the matter of Anne's second chance. This is highlighted by scenes in which she stirs in denial, dares to be wishful, gets pursued by another, and dreads the seemingly inevitable moment in which Frederick will wed someone else.In short, I loved watching the many effects that this relationship had on the characters. That level of consequence caused me to be more engaged in the story.2. DialogueI absolutely love the way 'Persuasion' is written -- in any form or version. Sometimes it's fun to just sit back and listen to the beauty of the English language when written and spoken well. I happen to prefer this version due to the added element of Anne's narration, along with some of the acting (particularly Tobias Menzies as William Elliot, Joseph Mawle as Harry Harville, Anthony Head as Sir Walter, and Alice Krige as Lady Russell).3. Great MusicAnother engaging element to the story is the excellent music composed by Martin Phipps. The tunes are beautifully emotional, and the man behind them is one of the best in the business.Overall, this will always be one of my favourite films, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys romances, classic or contemporary.",4,A Simply Beautiful Film,1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,2569,"[""'Persuasion"", 'ranks', 'one', 'all-time', 'favourite', 'romances', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'story', 'woman', 'Anne', 'reluctantly', 'turning', 'back', 'love', 'then', 'being', 'presented', 'possible', 'second', 'chance', 'years', 'later', 'also', 'story', 'man', 'Frederick', 'fighting', 'feelings', 'woman', 'slowly', 'losing', 'fight.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', '1995', 'adaptation', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'ultimately', 'have', 'say', 'prefer', '2007', 'edition', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', 'earlier', 'version', 'love', 'one', 'Here', 'are', 'primary', 'reasons.1', 'Sense', 'ConsequenceI', 'think', 'version', 'fantastic', 'job', 'centralizing', 'Anne', 'feelings', 'truly', 'conveys', 'effects', 'old', 'loss', 'renewed', 'pain', 'very', 'much', 'occasional', 'narration', 'placed', 'good', 'amount', 'focus', 'emotions', 'regret', 'longing', 'pondering', 'sense', 'consequence', ""n't"", 'just', 'limited', 'narration', 'though', 'present', 'subtle', 'look', 'undying', 'love', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'expressions', 'constantly', 'tell', 'story', 'being', 'sorrowful', 'certain', 'times', 'bordering', 'hopeful', 'others', 'Likewise', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Rupert', 'presentation', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'pain', 'Seeing', 'Anne', 'again', 'brought', 'state', 'constant', 'restraint', 'false', 'apathy', 'while', 'little', 'hints', 'true', 'feelings', 'begin', 'escape', 'course', 'also', 'matter', 'Anne', 'second', 'chance', 'highlighted', 'scenes', 'denial', 'be', 'wishful', 'pursued', 'seemingly', 'inevitable', 'moment', 'Frederick', 'will', 'wed', 'someone', 'else.In', 'short', 'loved', 'watching', 'many', 'effects', 'relationship', 'had', 'characters', 'level', 'consequence', 'caused', 'be', 'more', 'engaged', 'story.2', 'DialogueI', 'absolutely', 'love', 'way', ""'Persuasion"", 'written', 'form', 'version', 'fun', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'listen', 'beauty', 'English', 'language', 'when', 'written', 'spoken', 'well', 'happen', 'prefer', 'version', 'due', 'added', 'element', 'Anne', 'narration', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Tobias', 'Menzies', 'William', 'Elliot', 'Joseph', 'Mawle', 'Harry', 'Harville', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'Lady', 'Russell', '.3', 'Great', 'MusicAnother', 'engaging', 'element', 'story', 'excellent', 'music', 'composed', 'Martin', 'Phipps', 'tunes', 'are', 'beautifully', 'emotional', 'man', 'one', 'best', 'business.Overall', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'favourite', 'films', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'romances', 'classic', 'contemporary']",N/A
1120145,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B000YIGNKE,"Marcy G. ""MarcyG""","[425, 468]","""Persuasion"" is tied with ""Pride & Prejudice"" as my top favorite Jane Austen novel. I was looking forward to this version, after being a little disappointed with the 1995 adaptation (actors were a bit too old for their roles, I thought, but that's another review).While ""Northanger Abbey"" is a story of young love, ""Persuasion"" is a story of love lost.  Anne Eliott was once engaged to Frederick Wentworth but has had to give up the engagement due to the persuasion of her friend Lady Russell. Anne is the daughter of a baronet and Frederick is a young lieutenant with little prospects and was deemed by her friends and family as not worthy enough to marry Anne. Fast forward to 7 or so years later, and Anne's family is in dire circumstances. Her family has to move from their large country estate to Bath in an effort to retrench and avoid further debt.  Frederick returns to England as a wealthy and highly eligible naval captain and his and Anne's paths meet again. Frederick is pursued by 2 of Anne's younger sisters-in-law while Anne is left to wonder what might have been. After a stressful visit to Lyme, Frederick and Anne's paths briefly separate.  Anne moves to Bath where she is pursued by her cousin William Eliott and she crosses paths with Frederick again. Will love triumph the second time around?Whether you agree or disagree with my assessment of the 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, I think you will find that Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins are wonderful in their roles as Frederick Wentworth and Anne Eliott.  Sally Hawkins - unknown to me until now - gives a soul-stirring and endearing performance as Jane Austen's long suffering heroine.  Rupert Penry-Jones is aptly dashing and handsome, though perhaps a little bland, as Frederick (I'd take him over Ciaran Hinds any day). The supporting cast is solid - with a few exceptions - and the screenplay, up until the last 10 minutes, stays true to the tone and spirit of the book. The production values, costumes and locations are excellent. This scores points for actually filming in Bath and Lyme (actual locations from the book). Another high note is Martin Phipps (who also composed the amazing score of BBC's ""North & South) who delivers yet another stirring score.The reasons for the 4 stars are as follows (warning, spoilers!):a) Casting - I absolutely detest Amanda Hale as Mary Musgrove. She is annoying and stands out in a bad way from the rest of the cast. Julia Davis is also off as Elizabeth Eliott and looks more like Anne's wicked stepmom than her older (by 2 years) sister. Elizabeth is supposed to be beautiful and elegant, and Julia Davis is nowhere near this. Surely there are more than enough talented British actresses who could have played these roles.b) Changes - Some long-time fans will be a little irritated with the changes made to famous scenes from the book. This is where the 1995 version triumphs over this version. While the Amanda Root version remained faithful to the book, this version strayed in some of the vital scenes such as the dialogue between Captain Harville and Anne on woman's constancy; and the scene where Frederick writes a letter to Anne.c) The last 10 minutes - where Anne runs around Bath like a headless turkey - almost completely ruined it for me. Whoever thought of sending a docile, elegant, poised, upper-class lady like Anne to run around town like a servant girl is beyond me.  The adaptation would have been outstanding except for this miscalculation. I am not a purist, but there is just so much a long-time Jane Austen fan can take and this one crossed the line for me.All in all, however, I give it 4 stars for Sally, Rupert, most of the supporting cast, Bath, the score and the first 80 minutes.  It goes along swimmingly up until the climax, at which point I have to fast forward to skip the part I detest.  A good and solid adaptation, but ""Northanger Abbey"" starring JJ Feild and Felicity Jones gets my vote as my favorite of the recent Jane Austen adaptations.",4,Very well done......up until the last 10 minutes.,1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,4022,"['Persuasion', 'tied', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'top', 'favorite', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'version', 'being', 'little', 'disappointed', '1995', 'adaptation', 'actors', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'roles', 'thought', 'review', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'story', 'young', 'love', 'Persuasion', 'story', 'love', 'lost', 'Anne', 'Eliott', 'was', 'once', 'engaged', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'had', 'give', 'up', 'engagement', 'due', 'persuasion', 'friend', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'Anne', 'daughter', 'baronet', 'Frederick', 'young', 'lieutenant', 'little', 'prospects', 'was', 'deemed', 'friends', 'family', 'not', 'worthy', 'enough', 'marry', 'Anne', 'Fast', 'forward', '7', 'so', 'years', 'later', 'Anne', 'family', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'family', 'move', 'large', 'country', 'estate', 'Bath', 'effort', 'retrench', 'avoid', 'further', 'debt', 'Frederick', 'England', 'wealthy', 'highly', 'eligible', 'naval', 'captain', 'Anne', 'paths', 'meet', 'again', 'Frederick', 'pursued', '2', 'Anne', 'younger', 'sisters-in-law', 'Anne', 'left', 'wonder', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'stressful', 'visit', 'Lyme', 'Frederick', 'Anne', 'paths', 'briefly', 'separate', 'Anne', 'Bath', 'where', 'pursued', 'cousin', 'William', 'Eliott', 'paths', 'Frederick', 'again', 'Will', 'love', 'triumph', 'second', 'time', 'Whether', 'agree', 'disagree', 'assessment', '1995', 'version', 'starring', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'are', 'wonderful', 'roles', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'Anne', 'Eliott', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'unknown', 'now', 'soul-stirring', 'endearing', 'performance', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'long', 'suffering', 'heroine', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'aptly', 'dashing', 'handsome', 'perhaps', 'little', 'bland', 'Frederick', ""'d"", 'take', 'over', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'day', 'supporting', 'cast', 'solid', 'few', 'exceptions', 'screenplay', 'up', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'true', 'tone', 'spirit', 'book', 'production', 'values', 'costumes', 'locations', 'are', 'excellent', 'points', 'actually', 'filming', 'Bath', 'Lyme', 'actual', 'locations', 'book', 'high', 'note', 'Martin', 'Phipps', 'who', 'also', 'composed', 'amazing', 'score', 'BBC', 'North', 'South', 'who', 'yet', 'stirring', 'score.The', 'reasons', '4', 'stars', 'are', 'warning', 'spoilers', 'Casting', 'absolutely', 'detest', 'Amanda', 'Hale', 'Mary', 'Musgrove', 'annoying', 'out', 'bad', 'way', 'rest', 'cast', 'Julia', 'Davis', 'also', 'off', 'Elizabeth', 'Eliott', 'more', 'Anne', 'wicked', 'stepmom', 'older', '2', 'years', 'sister', 'Elizabeth', 'supposed', 'be', 'beautiful', 'elegant', 'Julia', 'Davis', 'nowhere', 'Surely', 'are', 'more', 'enough', 'talented', 'British', 'actresses', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'roles.b', 'Changes', 'long-time', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'irritated', 'changes', 'made', 'famous', 'scenes', 'book', 'where', '1995', 'version', 'triumphs', 'version', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'version', 'remained', 'faithful', 'book', 'version', 'strayed', 'vital', 'scenes', 'such', 'dialogue', 'Captain', 'Harville', 'Anne', 'woman', 'constancy', 'scene', 'where', 'Frederick', 'letter', 'Anne.c', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'where', 'Anne', 'Bath', 'headless', 'turkey', 'almost', 'completely', 'ruined', 'Whoever', 'thought', 'sending', 'docile', 'elegant', 'poised', 'upper-class', 'lady', 'Anne', 'run', 'around', 'town', 'servant', 'girl', 'adaptation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'outstanding', 'miscalculation', 'am', 'not', 'purist', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'long-time', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fan', 'can', 'take', 'one', 'crossed', 'line', 'me.All', 'however', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'Sally', 'Rupert', 'most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Bath', 'score', 'first', '80', 'minutes', 'along', 'swimmingly', 'climax', 'point', 'have', 'fast', 'forward', 'skip', 'part', 'detest', 'good', 'solid', 'adaptation', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'starring', 'JJ', 'Feild', 'Felicity', 'Jones', 'vote', 'favorite', 'recent', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'adaptations']",N/A

First of all, why only 90 minutes -- and by the time they did all the introductions, credits, etc. it was actually much shorter than that.I have to begin by saying that I was really irritated when Anne's soulful speech about the constancy of men and women in love became part of her discussion at the dinner table at Lyme. In the book, Wentworth overhears Anne and Harville talking much later in the story and then writes the letter to her which prompts their reunion. This scene was created by Jane Austen as part of her rewrite of Persuasion specifically to improve the strength of the end of the story. Why would anyone want to second guess her?As for the new version of the reconciliation, I guess since the writer used up the conversation about constancy earlier in the story, he had to invent a different way to explain how Anne and the Captain finally get together. The result is those rather silly and inappropriate scenes in which Anne is running all over Bath. Someone with Anne's upbringing would never have done that!And their first kiss...it was embarassing to see how long it took them to get their lips together. Her lips, which were supposed to be quivering with anticipation I guess, instead looked like a fish out of water gasping for air. I blame some of these bad moments on the director, not the actors.That said, I mostly liked Sally Hawkins as Anne. Sometimes she looked really pretty and sometimes she looked rather plain -- which is how I saw Anne when I read the book. Hawkins also did well portraying Anne's quiet strength and character.Rupert Penry-Jones is gorgeous and did a great job as Wentworth(what a change from his role in the TV show Spooks/MI-5), but he definately did not look as if he had spent even a single day on the deck of a ship. His pale complexion was too perfect.As for the dreadful portrayal of Mary Musgrove -- Where did that insipid laugh that the actress used several times come from?Finally, what to say about the ending that was added! There is no way that Wentworth could have purchased Kellynch Hall -- lease it maybe but not buy it. He was rich but I don't think he could have afforded it even if Mr. Elliot was willing or able to sell (which I don't think he would be considering it was undoubtedly entailed to the younger Mr. Elliot).This was such an opportunity to do something really remarkable and as far as I'm concerned, this movie missed the mark. Masterpiece Theater is usually great so I was surprised.Ok, having said all of these negative things, I have to admit I enjoyed it at some level and it was definately better on second viewing but I'd rather spend my time watching the earlier version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hind -- or better still, reading the book.",3,A missed opportunity...,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,2812,"['enjoyed', 'new', 'version', 'Persuasion', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'First', 'why', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'time', 'did', 'introductions', 'credits', 'etc', 'was', 'actually', 'much', 'shorter', 'that.I', 'have', 'begin', 'saying', 'was', 'really', 'irritated', 'when', 'Anne', 'soulful', 'speech', 'constancy', 'men', 'women', 'love', 'became', 'part', 'discussion', 'dinner', 'table', 'Lyme', 'book', 'Wentworth', 'Anne', 'Harville', 'talking', 'much', 'later', 'story', 'then', 'letter', 'prompts', 'reunion', 'scene', 'was', 'created', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'part', 'rewrite', 'Persuasion', 'specifically', 'improve', 'strength', 'end', 'story', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'second', 'guess', 'new', 'version', 'reconciliation', 'guess', 'writer', 'used', 'up', 'conversation', 'constancy', 'earlier', 'story', 'had', 'invent', 'different', 'way', 'explain', 'how', 'Anne', 'Captain', 'finally', 'get', 'together', 'result', 'rather', 'silly', 'inappropriate', 'scenes', 'Anne', 'running', 'Bath', 'Someone', 'Anne', 'upbringing', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'done', 'first', 'kiss', 'was', 'embarassing', 'see', 'how', 'long', 'took', 'get', 'lips', 'together', 'lips', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'quivering', 'anticipation', 'guess', 'instead', 'looked', 'fish', 'water', 'gasping', 'air', 'blame', 'bad', 'moments', 'director', 'not', 'actors.That', 'said', 'mostly', 'liked', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Anne', 'Sometimes', 'looked', 'really', 'pretty', 'looked', 'rather', 'plain', 'how', 'saw', 'Anne', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'Hawkins', 'also', 'did', 'well', 'portraying', 'Anne', 'quiet', 'strength', 'character.Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'gorgeous', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Wentworth', 'what', 'change', 'role', 'TV', 'show', 'Spooks/MI-5', 'definately', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'had', 'spent', 'even', 'single', 'day', 'deck', 'ship', 'pale', 'complexion', 'was', 'too', 'perfect.As', 'dreadful', 'portrayal', 'Mary', 'Musgrove', 'Where', 'did', 'insipid', 'actress', 'used', 'several', 'times', 'come', 'Finally', 'what', 'say', 'ending', 'was', 'added', 'way', 'Wentworth', 'could', 'have', 'purchased', 'Kellynch', 'Hall', 'lease', 'maybe', 'not', 'buy', 'was', 'rich', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'afforded', 'even', 'Mr.', 'Elliot', 'was', 'willing', 'able', 'sell', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'considering', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'entailed', 'younger', 'Mr.', 'Elliot', '.This', 'was', 'such', 'opportunity', 'do', 'something', 'really', 'remarkable', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'movie', 'missed', 'mark', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'usually', 'great', 'was', 'surprised.Ok', 'having', 'said', 'negative', 'things', 'have', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'level', 'was', 'definately', 'better', 'second', 'viewing', ""'d"", 'rather', 'spend', 'time', 'watching', 'earlier', 'version', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Ciaran', 'Hind', 'better', 'still', 'reading', 'book']",N/A

In addition, this production didn't have what I call a ""deep bench"".  The supporting actors seem to be there just for scenery, not really adding to the depth of the narrative. That said, it's a nice enough distraction if you're looking for a good film to pass an hour and a half.For a truly faithful and well-acted adaptation of Persuasion, I wholeheartedly recommend the vastly superior 1995 version starring Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root.",3,Pleasant enough,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,1117,"[""'ll"", 'give', 'production', 'three', 'stars', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'adaptation', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'Austen', 'finest', 'novel', 'found', 'jerky', 'camera', 'work', 'be', 'distracting', 'male', 'lead', 'insipid', 'overall', 'narrative', 'inconsistent', 'Austen', 'incomparable', 'novel.Sally', 'Hawkins', 'endearing', 'Anne', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'charming', 'enough', 'Wentworth', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'truly', 'apprehending', 'Wentworth', 'truly', 'spent', 'eight', 'years', 'pining', 'love', 'lost', 'reviewer', 'who', 'likened', 'Anne', 'running', 'around', 'Bath', 'penultimate', '5', 'minutes', 'film', 'headless', 'turkey', 'hit', 'dead', 'true', 'gentleman', 'daughter', 'would', 'behave', 'such', 'fashion', 'addition', 'production', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', 'call', 'deep', 'bench', 'supporting', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'there', 'just', 'scenery', 'not', 'really', 'adding', 'depth', 'narrative', 'said', 'nice', 'enough', 'distraction', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'film', 'pass', 'hour', 'half.For', 'truly', 'faithful', 'well-acted', 'adaptation', 'Persuasion', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'vastly', 'superior', '1995', 'version', 'starring', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Amanda', 'Root']",N/A

I was a little concerned that I wouldn't like it, I knew there was some business about Anne rejecting Frederick Wentworth at the persuading of her late mother's good friend Lady Russell, but as it turned out I love it. I would have liked to have seen Anne Elliot (Sally Hawkins) with a little less severe hair style, but I thought Sally did a wonderful job bringing Anne to life.My favorite scene is when Captain Wentworth goes to Anne in the city of Bath and he tells her of a rumor that Admrial Croft had heard, Anne was to marry a Mr. William Elliot and they would live at Kellynch Hall. Admrial and Mrs. Croft (Frederick's sister) are renting Kellynch Hall and if the rumor is true they would have to move. When Anne tells Frederick the Admrial is ""...utterly misinformed"" Rupert Penry-Jones as Frederick Wentworth says ""Misinformed? Utterly?"" his face changed, it was just as clear as day that he was smiling at her.

Although short, this film packs most of the best bits of Jane Austen's `Persuasion', into a 90 minute easy-to-watch (though hardly accurate) period piece, taking this film `to the masses' as intended.Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot and Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Frederick Wentworth are well cast, doing their parts justice: the others are mostly well cast, with a few exceptions (personally I found Mary Musgrove hard to take, the Musgrove sisters a bit too silly and Elizabeth Elliot a bit too old), and although I like this new adaptation, I think it cannot compare to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which was extremely well cast and was just so beautifully done.  This new version is intended to bring Jane Austen to new audiences and I think it does so admirably.  It is beautifully shot and nicely costumed, and there are some very sweet and emotional moments that portray the books good points nicely.  I like the focus that this film has on the type of wife and characters IN a wife that Captain Wentworth is interested in, and how Anne is or isn't fitting into that idea at any given point.Personally, one of my favorite things about this new `Persuasion' adaptation is the music (when it's there): the score that is part of this piece is very light, but mellow and haunting, sweet and melodious; I would love to purchase this music as a soundtrack CD, but haven't yet seen it available (nor I think, is it likely to be made so)...nonetheless, it is nicely done and worth paying attention to as you watch the film!Content: there is not much objectionable with this film: there is mild innuendo, polite references to marriages and flirtations, but nothing much to give offense: all in all, a family-friendly film...Yes, it's not entirely true to the book, yes, it's too short, yes, things have been changed, but the emotional swell created by the top-notch acting of Sally Hawkins, among others, as well as the build of the film and music, I think, pay off in the end: the end is short, too short for me, I will admit...the entire ending is summed into a quick few minutes in which everything is resolved that takes time to resolve in the book, but I still am happy to have this emotional and nicely-filmed version of Persuasion to add to the collection!",4,'Once there were no two hearts so open',1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,2646,"['three', 'new', 'iTV', 'films', 'done', 'part', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Season', 'year', 'one', 'favorite', 'was', 'really', 'toss-up', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'one', 'less', 'content', 'issues', 'iTV', 'Britain', 'adapted', 'following', '90', 'minute', 'TV', 'films', 'year', 'Persuasion', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'one', 'think', 'best', 'bunch', 'short', 'film', 'most', 'best', 'bits', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Persuasion', '90', 'minute', 'easy-to-watch', 'hardly', 'accurate', 'period', 'piece', 'taking', 'film', 'masses', 'intended.Sally', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'Captain', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'doing', 'parts', 'justice', 'others', 'are', 'mostly', 'well', 'cast', 'few', 'exceptions', 'personally', 'found', 'Mary', 'Musgrove', 'hard', 'take', 'Musgrove', 'bit', 'too', 'silly', 'Elizabeth', 'Elliot', 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'like', 'new', 'adaptation', 'think', 'can', 'not', 'compare', '1995', 'version', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'cast', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'beautifully', 'done', 'new', 'version', 'intended', 'bring', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'new', 'audiences', 'think', 'so', 'admirably', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'nicely', 'costumed', 'are', 'very', 'sweet', 'emotional', 'moments', 'portray', 'books', 'good', 'points', 'nicely', 'focus', 'film', 'type', 'wife', 'characters', 'IN', 'wife', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'interested', 'how', 'Anne', ""n't"", 'fitting', 'idea', 'given', 'point.Personally', 'one', 'favorite', 'things', 'new', 'Persuasion', 'adaptation', 'music', 'when', 'there', 'score', 'part', 'piece', 'very', 'light', 'mellow', 'haunting', 'sweet', 'melodious', 'would', 'love', 'purchase', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'available', 'think', 'likely', 'be', 'made', 'so', 'nonetheless', 'nicely', 'done', 'worth', 'paying', 'attention', 'watch', 'film', 'Content', 'not', 'much', 'objectionable', 'film', 'mild', 'innuendo', 'polite', 'references', 'marriages', 'flirtations', 'nothing', 'much', 'give', 'offense', 'family-friendly', 'film', 'Yes', 'not', 'entirely', 'true', 'book', 'yes', 'too', 'short', 'yes', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'emotional', 'swell', 'created', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'build', 'film', 'music', 'think', 'pay', 'off', 'end', 'end', 'short', 'too', 'short', 'will', 'admit', 'entire', 'ending', 'summed', 'quick', 'few', 'minutes', 'everything', 'resolved', 'time', 'resolve', 'book', 'still', 'am', 'happy', 'have', 'emotional', 'nicely-filmed', 'version', 'Persuasion', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

If you are like me in that respect, do not miss this adaptation of Miss Austen's Persuasion. I dearly loved the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds version but there is not as much passion displayed by Amanda Root in her Anne Elliott as there is in this version with Sally Hawkins playing the same role. And since we have two very different screenplays and directors, differences should be expected. The director of this version allows Sally Hawkins to look squarely into our eyes and pour her emotions out so that we could feel what Anne Elliott was feeling just as if we were sitting or standing face to face with her. And those evolving emotions of dread, shock, loss, despair, and resignation were palpable thanks to Sally Hawkins personality and wonderful skills as an actor. If you can watch this Persuasion and not be caught up in Anne's situation then your own heart is made of stone.No true purist can give any film adaptation 5-stars and still consider themselves a purist. So, how much leeway do you give screenwriters and directors in retelling an Austen classic? If you are an Austen romantic I think you take each adaptation for what it is and enjoy that version for what it brings to us in retelling Miss Austen's story--whether it is an adaptation of Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, or any other classic novel no matter the author. Now I grant you, the 2K sprint at the finish in this version of Persuasion might have been a little over the top, but it did fit Anne's character in this version. The end of the Ciaran Hinds/Amanda Root version was fine for what it was because Amanda's Anne was so understated. So her catching up with Mr. Hinds' Captain Wentworth in the reunification scene being underplayed does not detract from that version, even though by comparison it lacks the emotion that was allowed Sally Hawkins' Anne.Which is closer to the Jane Austen novel? Due to the ending scenes alone I would have to say the Hinds/Root version, yet they are both compromises due to length of time allowed and the fact that they are ADAPTATIONS, as they must be for the screen. The bottom line is that if you pass up seeing this version of Persuasion, you would be missing out on a wonderfully retold story and actors that will tug at your heart recreating Jane Austen's characters as interpreted by this screenwriter and developed by this director.",5,Don't let the purists let you miss this one!,1270598400,"04 7, 2010",2010,2428,"['am', 'hooked', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'romance', 'are', 'respect', 'do', 'not', 'miss', 'adaptation', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'Persuasion', 'dearly', 'loved', 'Amanda', 'Root/Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'version', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'passion', 'displayed', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Anne', 'Elliott', 'version', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'playing', 'same', 'role', 'have', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'screenplays', 'directors', 'differences', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'director', 'version', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'look', 'squarely', 'eyes', 'pour', 'emotions', 'out', 'so', 'could', 'feel', 'what', 'Anne', 'Elliott', 'was', 'feeling', 'just', 'were', 'sitting', 'standing', 'face', 'face', 'evolving', 'emotions', 'dread', 'shock', 'loss', 'despair', 'resignation', 'were', 'palpable', 'thanks', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'personality', 'wonderful', 'skills', 'actor', 'can', 'watch', 'Persuasion', 'not', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'Anne', 'situation', 'then', 'own', 'heart', 'made', 'stone.No', 'true', 'purist', 'can', 'give', 'film', 'adaptation', '5-stars', 'still', 'consider', 'purist', 'So', 'how', 'much', 'leeway', 'do', 'give', 'screenwriters', 'directors', 'retelling', 'Austen', 'classic', 'are', 'Austen', 'romantic', 'think', 'take', 'adaptation', 'what', 'enjoy', 'version', 'what', 'retelling', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'story', 'adaptation', 'Persuasion', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'other', 'classic', 'novel', 'matter', 'author', 'Now', 'grant', '2K', 'sprint', 'finish', 'version', 'Persuasion', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'top', 'did', 'fit', 'Anne', 'character', 'version', 'end', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds/Amanda', 'Root', 'version', 'was', 'fine', 'what', 'was', 'Amanda', 'Anne', 'was', 'so', 'understated', 'catching', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Hinds', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'reunification', 'scene', 'being', 'underplayed', 'not', 'detract', 'version', 'even', 'comparison', 'emotion', 'was', 'allowed', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Anne.Which', 'closer', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'Due', 'ending', 'scenes', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'Hinds/Root', 'version', 'yet', 'are', 'compromises', 'due', 'length', 'time', 'allowed', 'fact', 'are', 'ADAPTATIONS', 'must', 'be', 'screen', 'bottom', 'line', 'pass', 'up', 'seeing', 'version', 'Persuasion', 'would', 'be', 'missing', 'out', 'wonderfully', 'retold', 'story', 'actors', 'will', 'tug', 'heart', 'recreating', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'characters', 'interpreted', 'screenwriter', 'developed', 'director']",N/A
1120153,A151T9C99W0AA,B000YIGNKE,Walter P. Sheppard,"[27, 37]","I believe this must be the worst adaptation ever made of ""Persuasion.""  (I know of no competition for the distinction.)  I give it one star because it is not possible to award none.  It is as though scriptwriter Simon Burke knew and worked from an exceedingly abridged version of the novel.  He turned Austen's characters into sticks.  Her carefully depicted relationships among them and the equally careful mechanics of her plot aren't here.  For example, Captains Harville and Benwick are reduced to ciphers and their part in Austen's central consideration of whether men or women are faithful longer is obliterated, and her use of a pivotal discussion of the subject as a means to bring Anne and Wentworth together is absent.  Again, what Mrs. Smith has to tell Anne about William Elliot must be a mystery to anyone who doesn't know the novel.  In fact, her role in this version is so marginal that it would have been better to cut it altogether since her only significance in the story (as opposed to helping to show an aspect of Anne's character, which is also pretty much missing) is what she has to tell about Elliot.  Further, Burke either knows nothing or chooses to ignore the social mores of the time, most flagrantly in the concluding sequence of Anne chasing Wentworth through the streets of Bath, which is utterly preposterous.  Finally, Wentworth could not buy Kellynch as a wedding present for Anne; the estate is entailed and could not be sold by Sir Walter.Given the script and the hole-in-the-corner production, it may not be fair to judge the cast too much, but what we get is not very good.  Sally Hawkins's Anne certainly does not ""bloom,"" and she doesn't show behavior that makes the viewer accept her as always the best person to deal with a situation.  Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Wentworth mostly pouts.  Neither he nor Peter Wight as Admiral Croft looks as though he'd ever been to sea in so much as a rowboat.  (In fact, the whole naval background of the novel is mostly ignored.)  Julia Davis as Anne's supposedly ""beautiful"" older (by only two years) sister looks (and behaves) more like a middle-aged stepmother.  Tobias Menzies has nothing of the oily deviousness of William Elliot.  The only cast member who really looks the part is Sarah Buckland as Nurse Rooke, but she is used here only as set decoration rather than an important source of information for Anne.  Anthony Head is a passable Sir Walter Elliot.There seems to be no 100% satisfactory adaptation of ""Persuasion"" available.  The two contenders are an adaptation by Julian Mitchell from Granada TV in 1971 and one by Nick Dear from  the BBC and WGBH in 1995.  The Mitchell comprises five 60-minute episodes and, therefore, includes much more detail from the novel.  The Dear has a much stronger cast and production.  Its 104-minute running time is a far better adaptation of the original than the new Burke although it runs only 11 minutes longer.  The Dear also has Anne doing several things that would not have been possible at the time, but they are much less egregious than in the Burke.  I suggest you get both -- the Mitchell (for completeness) and the Dear (for the best production) and leave the Burke to sink from sight as quickly as possible.",1,Worst Ever,1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,3250,"['believe', 'must', 'be', 'worst', 'adaptation', 'ever', 'made', 'Persuasion', 'know', 'competition', 'distinction', 'give', 'one', 'star', 'not', 'possible', 'award', 'none', 'scriptwriter', 'Simon', 'Burke', 'knew', 'worked', 'exceedingly', 'abridged', 'version', 'novel', 'turned', 'Austen', 'characters', 'sticks', 'carefully', 'depicted', 'relationships', 'equally', 'careful', 'mechanics', 'plot', 'are', ""n't"", 'here', 'example', 'Captains', 'Harville', 'Benwick', 'are', 'reduced', 'ciphers', 'part', 'Austen', 'central', 'consideration', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'faithful', 'longer', 'obliterated', 'use', 'pivotal', 'discussion', 'subject', 'means', 'bring', 'Anne', 'Wentworth', 'together', 'absent', 'Again', 'what', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'tell', 'Anne', 'William', 'Elliot', 'must', 'be', 'mystery', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'novel', 'fact', 'role', 'version', 'so', 'marginal', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'cut', 'altogether', 'only', 'significance', 'story', 'opposed', 'helping', 'show', 'aspect', 'Anne', 'character', 'also', 'pretty', 'much', 'missing', 'what', 'tell', 'Elliot', 'Further', 'Burke', 'nothing', 'chooses', 'ignore', 'social', 'mores', 'time', 'most', 'flagrantly', 'concluding', 'sequence', 'Anne', 'chasing', 'Wentworth', 'streets', 'Bath', 'utterly', 'preposterous', 'Finally', 'Wentworth', 'could', 'not', 'buy', 'Kellynch', 'wedding', 'present', 'Anne', 'estate', 'entailed', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'sold', 'Sir', 'Walter.Given', 'script', 'hole-in-the-corner', 'production', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fair', 'judge', 'cast', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'get', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Anne', 'certainly', 'not', 'bloom', ""n't"", 'show', 'behavior', 'viewer', 'accept', 'always', 'best', 'person', 'deal', 'situation', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'mostly', 'Peter', 'Wight', 'Admiral', 'Croft', ""'d"", 'ever', 'been', 'sea', 'so', 'much', 'rowboat', 'fact', 'whole', 'naval', 'background', 'novel', 'mostly', 'ignored', 'Julia', 'Davis', 'Anne', 'supposedly', 'beautiful', 'older', 'only', 'two', 'years', 'sister', 'looks', 'more', 'middle-aged', 'stepmother', 'Tobias', 'Menzies', 'nothing', 'oily', 'deviousness', 'William', 'Elliot', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'who', 'really', 'part', 'Sarah', 'Buckland', 'Nurse', 'Rooke', 'used', 'here', 'only', 'set', 'decoration', 'rather', 'important', 'source', 'information', 'Anne', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'passable', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Elliot.There', 'be', '100', '%', 'satisfactory', 'adaptation', 'Persuasion', 'available', 'two', 'contenders', 'are', 'adaptation', 'Julian', 'Mitchell', 'Granada', 'TV', '1971', 'one', 'Nick', 'Dear', 'BBC', 'WGBH', '1995', 'Mitchell', 'five', '60-minute', 'episodes', 'therefore', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'novel', 'Dear', 'much', 'stronger', 'cast', 'production', '104-minute', 'running', 'time', 'far', 'better', 'adaptation', 'original', 'new', 'Burke', 'only', '11', 'minutes', 'longer', 'Dear', 'also', 'Anne', 'doing', 'several', 'things', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'time', 'are', 'much', 'less', 'egregious', 'Burke', 'suggest', 'get', 'Mitchell', 'completeness', 'Dear', 'best', 'production', 'leave', 'Burke', 'sink', 'sight', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible']",N/A
1120154,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000YIGNKE,Z Hayes,"[4, 4]","As with all adaptations of Jane Austen's works, this recent version of Persuasion is by no means perfect, and purists may revile it for the liberties it takes with the novel, yet it has its strengths.Firstly, the storyline [for those unfamiliar with the plot] - Persuasion is a story of love lost & regained, of waiting [8 yrs in this case], and of constancy in feelings. Sally Hawkins plays Anne Elliott, who is at present a 27 year old spinster living with her father and oldest sister, with fond and poignant recollection of a long-ago romantic attachment that went sour. 8 years earlier, Anne had rejected a young naval officer, Frederick Wentworth [played by a very delectable Rupert Penry-Jones] under pressure from her disapproving family and godmother, Lady Russell [Alice Krige]. She finds herself at present having to leave her home, Kellynch due to the spendthrift nature of her father and sister, and learns that the family home is to be leased to none other than Wentworth's sister and brother-in-law. Soon, Anne's and Frederick's paths cross, and his improved fortunes make him a good catch causing Anne much anguish as she realises that society's conventions prevent her from declaring her true feelings for him, whilst watching other women fawn over him. The rest of the story deals with what happens to Anne and Frederick.As for the adaptation - the casting is very credibly done. In the 1995[?] version starring Amanda Roots [as Anne Elliott] and Ciaran Hinds [as Frederick Wentworth], I felt the two leads were too old for their roles, though well-played. In the latest version, Sally Hawkins not only looks the part age-wise but reveals the depth of her emotions very well, portraying with a glance or a look what she cannot say with words. Similarly, Penry-Jones makes a dashing Naval Captain, and his eyes convey so very much! One of the scenes that have stayed with me is the scene where he watches intently whilst Anne plays the piano -his eyes are absolutely riveted upon Anne and you wonder at the depth of his feelings [whilst also pondering -is he reviled by her for her past rejection of him, or as in love with her as he was 8 years ago?].The other actors do a credible job with their roles as well - Alice Krige as the meddlesome Lady Russell, Anthony Head as the vain and snobbish Sir Walter etc.The music and cinematography aptly evoke the sense of the time and places. Scenes of Bath, Lyme etc are beautifully portrayed, as is the countryside.However, my one real grouse with this adaptation is the last couple of minutes of this version - poor Anne Elliott is shown throwing caution and notions of propriety to the wind, and running about town looking for Frederick Wentworth! It is just unimaginable, and though I get the sense this was deliberately done to show the urgency of Anne's situation and fragile state of mind, I felt it was overdone and in bad taste [in this i much preferred the more moderate scene in the '95 version].But, all in all, I did like this version on the whole, and felt that it was a well-made, and well-acted production worthy of Austen fans [except perhaps purists, for obvious reasons] ,and also fans of period dramas.",4,"A well-made adaptation that may offend purists, but has its merit points",1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,3183,"['adaptations', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'works', 'recent', 'version', 'Persuasion', 'means', 'perfect', 'purists', 'may', 'revile', 'liberties', 'novel', 'strengths.Firstly', 'storyline', '[', 'unfamiliar', 'plot', ']', 'Persuasion', 'story', 'love', 'lost', 'regained', 'waiting', '[', '8', 'yrs', 'case', ']', 'constancy', 'feelings', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Anne', 'Elliott', 'who', 'present', '27', 'year', 'old', 'spinster', 'living', 'father', 'oldest', 'sister', 'fond', 'poignant', 'recollection', 'long-ago', 'romantic', 'attachment', 'went', 'sour', '8', 'years', 'earlier', 'Anne', 'had', 'rejected', 'young', 'naval', 'officer', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', '[', 'played', 'very', 'delectable', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', ']', 'pressure', 'disapproving', 'family', 'godmother', 'Lady', 'Russell', '[', 'Alice', 'Krige', ']', 'present', 'having', 'leave', 'home', 'Kellynch', 'due', 'spendthrift', 'nature', 'father', 'sister', 'family', 'home', 'be', 'leased', 'none', 'other', 'Wentworth', 'sister', 'brother-in-law', 'Soon', 'Anne', 'Frederick', 'paths', 'cross', 'improved', 'fortunes', 'make', 'good', 'catch', 'causing', 'Anne', 'much', 'anguish', 'society', 'conventions', 'prevent', 'declaring', 'true', 'feelings', 'whilst', 'watching', 'other', 'women', 'fawn', 'rest', 'story', 'deals', 'what', 'Anne', 'Frederick.As', 'adaptation', 'casting', 'very', 'credibly', 'done', '1995', '[', ']', 'version', 'starring', 'Amanda', 'Roots', '[', 'Anne', 'Elliott', ']', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', '[', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', ']', 'felt', 'two', 'leads', 'were', 'too', 'old', 'roles', 'well-played', 'latest', 'version', 'Sally', 'not', 'only', 'part', 'age-wise', 'depth', 'emotions', 'very', 'well', 'portraying', 'glance', 'look', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'words', 'Similarly', 'Penry-Jones', 'dashing', 'Naval', 'Captain', 'eyes', 'convey', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'One', 'scenes', 'have', 'stayed', 'scene', 'where', 'intently', 'whilst', 'Anne', 'piano', '-his', 'eyes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'riveted', 'Anne', 'wonder', 'depth', 'feelings', '[', 'whilst', 'also', 'pondering', '-is', 'reviled', 'past', 'rejection', 'love', 'was', '8', 'years', 'ago', ']', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'credible', 'job', 'roles', 'well', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'meddlesome', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'vain', 'snobbish', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'etc.The', 'music', 'cinematography', 'aptly', 'evoke', 'sense', 'time', 'places', 'Scenes', 'Bath', 'Lyme', 'etc', 'are', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'countryside.However', 'one', 'real', 'grouse', 'adaptation', 'last', 'couple', 'minutes', 'version', 'poor', 'Anne', 'Elliott', 'shown', 'throwing', 'caution', 'notions', 'propriety', 'wind', 'running', 'about', 'town', 'looking', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'just', 'unimaginable', 'get', 'sense', 'was', 'deliberately', 'done', 'show', 'urgency', 'Anne', 'situation', 'fragile', 'state', 'mind', 'felt', 'was', 'overdone', 'bad', 'taste', '[', 'i', 'much', 'preferred', 'more', 'moderate', 'scene', ""'95"", 'version', ']', '.But', 'did', 'like', 'version', 'whole', 'felt', 'was', 'well-made', 'well-acted', 'production', 'worthy', 'Austen', 'fans', '[', 'perhaps', 'purists', 'obvious', 'reasons', ']', 'also', 'fans', 'period', 'dramas']",N/A
1120155,AU61CID785ACB,B000YIGNKE,Zuberdeen,"[25, 31]","I am a huge Jane Austen fan and I love all of her books. ""Persuasion"" is a subtle, gentle sort of love story that, when filmed, relies heavily on the actors to portray emotions that must be kept hidden or simmering -- not an easy feat for any actor! Unfortunately, the casting of the actors here is so far off it makes me wonder what the casting director was thinking.To start, poor Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot is a disaster. Yes, Anne is supposed to have grown plain at her advanced age of 27 (!) but not downright homely. Perhaps it is cruel to use the word ""homely,"" but I can't think of any other way to describe Ms. Hawkins in this movie. She is not only homely but so overwhelmingly cowed I wanted to shake her! This is not Anne as Austen wrote the character. And Rupert Penry-Jones, while a good actor and a hottie to boot, was not a good choice for Captain Wentworth. He is far too ""pretty,"" and not rough enough to convince us he won his fortune as a naval captain in the Napoleonic wars. The combination of the painfully unattractive Anne with the super-cute Frederick just does not work -- there is no chemistry between the actors, (oh dear God that awful kiss!) and not for one minute did I believe he was in love with her -- now or ever.Other questionable casting choices include the way-too-old looking Julia Davis who played Elizabeth and the weirdly stooped, mugging actress who played Anne's other sister, Mary. Yikes!Casting that worked well, however, was Anthony Head (Giles from ""Buffy,"" believe it or not) as the snobbish Sir Walter, and the marvelous Tobias Menzies (""Brutus"" from HBO's ""Rome"") as cousin William Elliot. Tobias Menzies and the lovely production quality of the film earn it two stars, but otherwise if you are a fan of ""Persuasion,"" you must check out the version starring Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root. Truly outstanding acting and a DVD you will watch again and again -- well worth purchasing. As for the Hawkins-Jones version, watch it on Masterpiece Theatre or rent it, then compare it to the Hinds/Root version, and see what you think before you buy.",2,Who the heck did the casting here???,1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2008,2093,"['am', 'huge', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fan', 'love', 'books', 'Persuasion', 'subtle', 'gentle', 'sort', 'love', 'story', 'when', 'filmed', 'heavily', 'actors', 'portray', 'emotions', 'must', 'be', 'kept', 'hidden', 'simmering', 'not', 'easy', 'feat', 'actor', 'Unfortunately', 'casting', 'actors', 'here', 'so', 'far', 'wonder', 'what', 'casting', 'director', 'was', 'thinking.To', 'start', 'poor', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'disaster', 'Yes', 'Anne', 'supposed', 'have', 'grown', 'plain', 'advanced', 'age', '27', 'not', 'downright', 'homely', 'Perhaps', 'cruel', 'use', 'word', 'homely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'way', 'describe', 'Ms.', 'Hawkins', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'homely', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'cowed', 'wanted', 'shake', 'not', 'Anne', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'character', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'good', 'actor', 'hottie', 'boot', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'choice', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'far', 'too', 'pretty', 'not', 'rough', 'enough', 'convince', 'won', 'fortune', 'naval', 'captain', 'Napoleonic', 'wars', 'combination', 'painfully', 'unattractive', 'Anne', 'super-cute', 'Frederick', 'just', 'not', 'work', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'oh', 'dear', 'God', 'awful', 'kiss', 'not', 'one', 'minute', 'did', 'believe', 'was', 'love', 'now', 'ever.Other', 'questionable', 'casting', 'choices', 'include', 'way-too-old', 'looking', 'Julia', 'Davis', 'who', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'weirdly', 'stooped', 'mugging', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Anne', 'other', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Casting', 'worked', 'well', 'however', 'was', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'Giles', 'Buffy', 'believe', 'not', 'snobbish', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'marvelous', 'Tobias', 'Menzies', 'Brutus', 'HBO', 'Rome', 'cousin', 'William', 'Elliot', 'Tobias', 'Menzies', 'lovely', 'production', 'quality', 'film', 'earn', 'two', 'stars', 'otherwise', 'are', 'fan', 'Persuasion', 'must', 'check', 'out', 'version', 'starring', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Truly', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'DVD', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'well', 'purchasing', 'Hawkins-Jones', 'version', 'watch', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'rent', 'then', 'compare', 'Hinds/Root', 'version', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'buy']",N/A
