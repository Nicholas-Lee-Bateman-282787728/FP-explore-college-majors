999891,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B000GAKLZI,Ace Reader,"[7, 9]","A rare phenomenon has happened in the movie theater tonight!I witnessed a sold-out audience applauding the screen quite hardily at the conclusion of this new film version of ""Les Miserables"".I recommend this film to mature audience members only. The rating of PG-13 is okay but I must warn that this is a serious adult story about two men who start out hating one another, and one of them finding it in his heart to forgive. This story is a tragedy. This is not a kids movie. It contains many scenes of cruelty, strife, war, death, and blood. There are a few scenes containing sexual situations.This film is a true musical. That means the singing is non-stop throughout it's entire running time of 157 minutes.There is a bit of spoken dialog here and there. But not much. Mostly all dialog is delivered with song.For younger people this type of musical may be tiresome and boring. It may be a challenge for them to stay interested and have enough patience to see it through. If they could it would be good for them.Director Tom Hooper has commanded top-notch acting from his cast. Character delivery by each and every one of this films actors and actresses is excellent. Claude-Michel Schonberg's score bring substance and weight to this beautiful film. I'm thrilled to see the very talented, Russel Crowe playing the part of the morally confused ""Javert"". He's fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed his acting, singing voice, and every single scene he was in. Hugh Jackman is excellent as mentally tortured ""Jean Valjean"". He masterfully carries this films story-line with presence, a powerful singing voice and mesmerizing skillful acting. Anne Hathaway's heart-wrenching singing and acting delivery as the ill-fated ""Fantine"" will most likely be remembered for a very long time to come. I'm sure her skillfully amazing performance will earn her a 'Best Actress' Oscar nomination and possibly a win at this years upcoming Academy Awards. I must also mention the lovely British actress Samantha Barks who's acting and vocal delivery as tragic heroine Eponine was fabulous! Her Oscar worthy death scene was one of the most breathtakingly beautiful scenes in this film.It was an unexpected pleasure and surprise to see award nominated and award winning stage singer and actor, Colm Wilkinson in this film. Look for him playing the part of the ""Bishop"". He acted and sang in the starring role of ""Jean Valjean"" on Broadway in the musical stage production version of ""Les Miserables"" for many years.The pacing was excellent in this film. I believe many, if not all categories for the creation of this film will be nominated for awards. The attention to detail in this film is excellent! The Costumes, Art, Set Direction and Decoration are all superb. Special-effects, lighting and sound are impeccable. Make-up is amazing and worthy of nomination's as well. This film is very good and deserves many accolades.I recommend this film but warn that you may want to bring many tissues with you into the theater. This film will make you cry. It was is a pleasure to watch.

999896,A9VSDB7HJFMAO,B000GAKLZI,AJ Hayden,"[25, 29]","**WARNING: This review may get rather long. I have a ton of thoughts about this movie, after seeing the stage show so many times. So this may just be me rambling. Also...SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS! EVERYWHERE!My review for the higlights CD was less than glowing. However, I can say happily that the CD is a very, very, very, very poor reflection of the movie itself. Ignore the highlights CD. Forget about it. It doesn't do this movie justice. Because while it's far from perfect, I'm can happily say that it is the Les Mis movie musical.THE ACTINGHUGH JACKMAN (Jean Valjean)--8/10 Aside from Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman's been getting quite a bit of flack for his Valjean. To be honest, I don't see it. Acting-wise, Jackman is awesome and embodies Valjean. I agree with those who have said he carries the movie. However, singing-wise he was occasionally lacking. He had a habit of speak-singing a LOT. As many have said, his ""Bring Him Home"" wasn't exactly stellar and was somewhat disappointing (but not terrible.) So, Hugh Jackman makes for a really good Valjean, with a few vocal flaws that make him a little less than perfect.RUSSELL CROWE (Javert)--7/10 Perhaps the most controversial member of the cast! Personally, I don't think he was that awful. Was he the best Javert ever? No. Do I feel they could have gotten someone better? Yes. However, his voice really isn't that bad. It's off-putting at first, but you get used to it, and once you do, he's decent. His acting made up for his singing. What makes his Javert nice is his more subtle moments (there were little moments in Fantine's arrest and the barricade scenes I really liked.) So, he really isn't that bad. By no means is he amazing, but he's not godawful.ANNE HATHAWAY (Fantine)--9/10 Methinks she was born to play Fantine. First of all, holy CRAP, does Hathaway have pipes. I had no idea she could sing like that. Her Fantine is much more fragile than Fantines in the stage productions I've seen (which makes sense.) She's not a belty Fantine. But although her voice isn't Broadway powerful, you can hear the vocal power underlying in her voice. Her acting is amazing. If she doesn't break your heart, you have no soul. (Her delivery of ""Come, Cosette. My child, where did you go?"" Ahhh! Tears!)SACHA BARON COHEN AND HELENA BONHAM CARTER (Thenardier and Mme. Thenardier)-- 6/10 They were fine as the Thenardiers. I didn't feel they were anything spectacular, but they weren't bad. Their ""Master of the House"" felt a bit off for me. On one hand, it was much toned down for the stage version, but at the same time, it still felt to gaudy for this movie (although this may have to do more with direction than the actors themselves.) So, like I said, fine, serviceable, but nothing truly special.AMANDA SEYFRIED (Cosette)--5/10 Yeah, she just didn't work for me. Personally, I thought she was worse that Crowe. While I definitely think she has the looks to play Cosette (and her costumes were awesome), she doesn't have a very strong voice. It was shrill and her vibrata was insane. I will say though, she was rather heartbrekaing in the epilogue at Valjean's death.EDDIE REDMAYNE (Marius)--9/10 Like Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne appears to have been born to play Marius. He's got an AMAZING voice, he's attractive (at least, I think so). He also seems to give more depth to Marius's character. His acting, his facial expressions, all add so much more to Marius. His ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" was just...there are no words. I will say that his ""jawbrato"" got a little distracting. There's nothing really wrong with this, per se, and it may have been more distracting because of all the close-ups. But, hey, I can deal with the jawbrato because Eddie Redmayne is perfection personified.SAMANTHA BARKS (Eponine)--9/10 Vocally, she's awesome. Her voice is more toned down from her theatre days, but it's still amazing. She plays a more fragile Eponine, who's not the more street-smart, tough Eponine we see in a lot of stage productions. This isn't to say she's weak. Her Eponine has some fight in her, she's just more subtle. Her part seemed quite reduced though, which isn't really her fault, of course. It just would have been nice to see her more.AARON TVEIT (Enjolras)--9/10 Like Samantha Barks, Tveit plays a more subdued version of his character. When I first listened to the recording, I was a tad off-put by how...weak Enjolras seemed. I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE WRONG IN MY LIFE! Aaron Tveit has an awesome voice and has a commanding prescence as Enjolras. You almost want more screen time from him.ISABELLE ALLEN and DANIEL HUTTLESTONE (Young Cosette and Gavroche, respectively)--8/10 I was surprisingly impressed with both. Usually, young Cosette and Gavroche are played by terrible singers. But both were freaking adorable. I loved Isabelle Allen, so adorable. Daniel Huttlestone made for a good Gavroche, with plenty of spunk and pluckyness. However, his accent felt a bit forced. (Or maybe it's real. I don't know, I was sort of hoping they'd get rid of the Cockney-accent-straight-from-Oliver-Twist Gavroche and just make him sound like veryone else.)THOUGHTS ON THE CUTS/ADDITIONS/LYRIC CHANGESBeing a fan of the musical, I know the libretto pretty well. So I was interested to see what cuts/changes/additions would be made. There were a few changes/cuts I really didn't like. These include:*CUTS FROM ""ON MY OWN"" AND ""A LITTLE FALL OF RAIN"": Probably due to time. I'm not completely anguished over these cuts (since, if we're being totally honest, Eponine's not the most important character in the first place). But it would have been nice to see Samantha Barks a little more.*CUTS FROM FANTINE'S ARREST: The part that suffers most is the fight between Fantine and Bamatabois. It goes from ""Here's something new...the usual price for just one slice of your pie"" to ""No, no, m'sieur..."" to ""You've got some nerve..."" and then Fantine attacks him. A lot of the lines were cut, including Fantine's ""I'll kill you, you bastard, try any of that!"" Again, not to broken up about these cuts, as it helped with time (and I feel like the ""I'll kill you"" would have seemed a bit awkward coming from a very weak looking Fantine.) However,e the cuts made the fight seem much, much shorter and if you blink, you might miss all of it. ;)*CUTS FROM ""DRINK WITH ME"": This is the last song the students sing together and it has some really good lines in it (Grantaire's verse, especially.) But a lot of it was cut, which was unfortunate, since it was a really good song. It's still there, just not the whole thing.*CUTS FROM ""EVERY DAY"": I don't know why they cut Marius's ""Every day, I wonder who it was that brought me from the barricade"" as it makes it appear Marius all ready knows who saves him, which then makes Thenardier's whole thing at the wedding seem rather odd. So a little plot hole there.*CUTS FROM ""THE CONFRONTATION"": Valjean loses a chunk during the Valjean/Javert harmony, so it's just Javert singing, ""I was born inside a jail..."" They also cut everything from ""And this I swear to you tonight"" on, which made me sad, especially since it sounded like it was going to be very sad in the script. (Valjean was scripted to be singing to Fantine's dead body as it is flung into a wagon to be buried in the cemetery.)*CUTS FROM ""THE ATTACK ON RUE PLUMET"": This cut annoyed me the most. It just seemed so jumpy! Not to mention it sort of creates a little bit of a plot hole. It jumps from Eponine screaming to Valjean hearing it, instantly assuming it's Javert, and deciding to pack up. That's it. He doesn't even interact with Cosette, whose lines there sort of finalize his decision to leave. In the movie, it makes it look like Valjean is just leaving because he heard Cosette scream at who knows what.The cut I did like was reducing the length of ""Turning."" It's always been such a filler song to come before ""Empty Chairs."" (And it was only written so the women ensemble had more to do than be prostitutes.) So, it was nice to see most of that gone.And, I know some of you will stone me for saying this, but I didn't mind that ""Dog Eats Dog"" was cut. For one, it really would have slogged the movie's pacing at that point. The way the movie sets it up, you're invested in Marius and Valjean. You probably don't want to hear about Thenardier robbing corpses. So it helped tighten up the pacing. Also, the sewers in the movie are NASTY, so I don't really think I would want to see Thenardier singing a three minute solo in poop.I did like the additional interactions between Valjean and Javert in Montreuil-sur-Mer. It added more depth to Javert's character (like when he asks to be relieved of his position.) Also, these new additions gave us more reason as to why Valjean just sort of turned his back on Fantine at the factory. So, I liked the added lyrics.As for lyric changes, most of them I didn't like. For example:""And the plague is coming on fast, ready to kill!"" Why did that need to be changed? ""Winter"" was fine. In fact, it made more sense when the lyrics earlier were ""At the end of the day you're another day colder and the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill."" ""Plague"" just sounded sort of silly. This is the 1820s, not the Dark Ages.""Follow to the letter your itinerary! This badge of shame you wear until you die."" The lines just felt awkward. The other lyrics in the stage version were fine, although I did like the ""It warns you're a dangerous man"" in the movie.The lyric change I have mixed feelings for is; ""It's a story of one who turned form hating. A man who only learned to love when you were in his keeping."" I actually like this line a lot, as I think it's just something really sweet for Valjean to say to Cosette. However, the original lines from the stage musicl are, ""It's a story of those who always loved you. Your mother gave her life for you, then gave you to my keeping."" It's a sort of pivotal, if you will, scene in the musical (and book) where Cosette finally learns of her mother, so it was disappointing to see that cut.And the lyric change I love is ""Would you weep, Cosette, if I were to fall?"" Not because it's anything stellar or beautiful, but it makes so much more sense. In the musical is, ""Would you weep, Cosette, should Marius fall?"" It sounds really dumb. I mean, why is Marius talking in third person about himself anyway?THOUGHTS ON THE SONGS/HOW THEY WERE DONEFor the most part, I liked the way everything transitioned to the screen. The new placements of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" and ""Stars"" work so much better, in my opinion. IDAD is that much more tragic. Stars makes more sense there, as he's just lost Valjean, and in the stage play, I feel like ""Stars"" coming between ""Look Down"" and ""Red and Black"" sort of interrupts the flow. However, I have mixed feelings for ""On My Own"" getting moved. It makes sense as it probably would have been awkward during the barricade scenes. It would have changed the mood midway through. However, I feel like ""On My Own"" being right before ""A Little Fall of Rain"" works much better, as we've been with Eponine longer and she's finalyl letting it all out. Earlier, we feel pity for her, but not as much. Not to mention that in the new movie placement, it's right after the Rue Plumet robbery, where Valjean decides to leave for England, which is a pretty big moment and then...oh, we're listening to Eponine talk about her love life. Mmkay.I liked how a lot of the songs looked in the movie.""Lovely Ladies"" looked sort of like something out of a horror movie, but I think it helped emphasize the sort of hell the prostitutes are living in. It was very toned down and sort of sexless (or at least as sexless as a song about prostitutes can be), which I like a lot. I feel as though ""Lovely Ladies"" should focus more on Fantine's fall and the horrible life the prostitues live, as opposed to being overly raunchy and gaudy, like it is in the stage production, for the purpose of just being raunchy.""Come to Me"" was beautifully tragic, with Fantine hallucinating of Cosette. *weeps over keyboard*""The Confrontation"" looked way more epic on screen. It's a cool song in the musical, but it can sometimes be ruined by the cheesy stage fighting. Here, it looks awesome. Javert has a sword! Valjean has a...stick of wood he ripped off a wall! Valjean makes his escape by jumping out of a door into a river! Yay! Cool!""Chain Gang/Work Song"" looked awesome, with the men pulling in the giant ship. Much better than the staging of ""mime tools.""Loved how the finale turned out, when Valjean died. The church, the bishop, ahh! Beautiful!Anyway, to sum this rambling review up, Les Miserables is a semi-flawed, but overall excellent adaptation of the musical that should please most fans.",4,"Not perfect, but pretty

I went into this with no expectations at all. At first I thought the movie started off kind of fragmented and I figured because it had to introduce everybody and I was right. The film ended up as it went on drawing me in more and more and making me fall in love with it and by the end i was mesmerized with how wonderful and amazing the movie is. I believe they picked perfect roles because after i saw the movie i listened to the broadway soundtrack and i believe they did very well on picking out the cast for their vocal ranges and capabilities.

Film was able to give some intimate shots that live theater doesn't do nearly so well, at least in my opinion.Any show that makes me choke up and even cry several times during the space of nearly three hours gets a thumbs up from me.

999916,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B000GAKLZI,amerdale876,"[5, 6]","A lot of diehard fans of the original Broadway musical were awfully skeptical about the actors' singing and cinematic interpretations of a musical they have loved and adored for years. And I was one of those same fans. However, let me put this to rest right now. The film version is just as good as the Broadway musical. There are pros and cons to the cinematic version. One pro is also a con in that the singers can really emote better with their voices and faces, making the film seem more real; however, their voices sometimes go a bit too soft -- although it is a very minor occurrence. Another con is Russell Crowe's singing voice as Inspector Javert. Now, I know his songs are extremely difficult to sing, and Crowe does have a singing background, but his voice just didn't ""wow"" me like the others did. Still, he did OK. Samantha Barks as Eponine (one of my favorite characters) was fantastic and really honed the character she'd been playing since 2010 at Westminster's Queen's Theatre. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the villainous Thenardiers did OK, but they just couldn't hold a candle to Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway's performances. Hugh Jackman retains his theatrical chops as Jean Valjean and has the power to both sing and heavily emote, making you believe he is the tortured, reformed man of God; also, I loved that director Tom Hooper cast the original (to me) Valjean, Colm Wilkinson, as the Bishop. But the heavy hitter here -- the Academy Award-winning performance -- is that of Anne Hathaway. If you've ever read my blog or heard me talk of her, you know I'm not the biggest fan of hers. Then,The Dark Knight Rises (+Ultraviolet Digital Copy)came out and I had to admit she did pretty well. Now, with that plus this performance, I'm eating crow. She was spectacular. Her performance while singing ""I Dreamed a Dream"" was the best acting -- and, at the same time, singing -- I've seen in a very long time. There's a moment in the song where she's about to hit a high note and you see her convulsing, almost hyperventilating, and think she won't hit that note. But she does. And the fact that all of the actors sang live on set lets you know that she's got talent. If she doesn't get some kind of major award for this role, then awards will be useless. A great musical and a great movie; director Tom Hooper has a great eye for cinematography and some of the most simple shots in the film come in at the right time and are magnificant to look at. The musical is all here (in the film) in its entirety -- singing and all! (Slight note: the only lines cut in the film is at the beginning of ""Beggars at the Feast""; I guess the filmmakers wanted to be more politically correct, so they cut out the verse that contains: ""Here comes a prince/There goes a Jew/This one's a queer/But what can you do?"") Overall, this is one of the best films of the year as well as one of the best movie musicals ever. Even better, fans, it's all in here -- all of the music and sing-talking, as well as the underlying message of how our actions can touch and affect others -- ""to love another person is to see the face of God"" and ""even the darkest nights will end and the sun will rise.""

999917,A2GLQE3IMC39JF,B000GAKLZI,Amy Donnelly,"[9, 18]","I love 'les mis' and have done since i first saw it on stage when i was 10 years old. I went on to read the novel the details of the characters in that were amazing, really shown in the 10th and 25th anniversary concerts. This movie however struggles on a few fronts.The first, and perhaps most obvious, is Javert. Russel Crowe tried his best but the part was just too difficult for his vocal range. The complexity of Javert comes out in his voice and Crowe is simply unable to do this consistantly, the result being a character that doesn't comes over as well as he could. I'm not saying anything against Crowe's acting ability here or his strength as a singer in general. He is a good singer who simply overreached himself a bit with this particular project (although the live singing probably didn't help him).The second front which the movie struggles on is the music itself. At times in the movie the directors either re-arrange the music, remove it completly or write new stuff. The movie directors seem to think that a ultra successful show that has been seen by millions doesn't know how to tell a story. For people who have not seen the musical before this is not a problem but for those who have it can cause confusion. The biggest changes have got to be the lines removed at the begining to introduce Javert and Valjean (as this is the whole plot of the story).The song 'do you hear the people sing' is also changed (and not for the better), the song should be Enjolras' call to arms but it has become a chorus song that has minimal musical impact. The removal of the song 'turning' also deminishes the impact of the revolution in the movie, making it seem like no-one but Marius is bothered about them.Overall the movie was good and I enjoyed it. The visuals were amasing, although at times they concentarted too much on visuals and not music. The costumes were good and so was the acting, unfortunatly the choice to make the actors sing live (although it made it more emotional) made the singing inconsistant and showed the struggles the actors had reaching and holding notes.This movie is worth watching if you have not watched 'Les Mis' before. If you have then just bare in mind that changes are made and if you are very specific about the musical don't watch it.",3,struggles,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,2279,"['love', ""'les"", 'mis', 'have', 'done', 'i', 'first', 'saw', 'stage', 'when', 'i', 'was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'went', 'read', 'novel', 'details', 'characters', 'were', 'amazing', 'really', 'shown', '10th', '25th', 'anniversary', 'concerts', 'movie', 'however', 'few', 'fronts.The', 'first', 'perhaps', 'most', 'obvious', 'Javert', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'tried', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'difficult', 'vocal', 'range', 'complexity', 'Javert', 'out', 'voice', 'Crowe', 'simply', 'unable', 'do', 'consistantly', 'result', 'being', 'character', ""n't"", 'over', 'as', 'well', 'could', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'anything', 'Crowe', 'acting', 'ability', 'here', 'strength', 'singer', 'general', 'good', 'singer', 'who', 'simply', 'overreached', 'bit', 'particular', 'project', 'live', 'singing', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', '.The', 'second', 'front', 'movie', 'music', 'times', 'movie', 'directors', 're-arrange', 'music', 'remove', 'completly', 'write', 'new', 'stuff', 'movie', 'directors', 'seem', 'think', 'ultra', 'successful', 'show', 'been', 'seen', 'millions', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'musical', 'not', 'problem', 'who', 'have', 'can', 'cause', 'confusion', 'biggest', 'changes', 'have', 'got', 'be', 'lines', 'removed', 'begining', 'introduce', 'Javert', 'Valjean', 'whole', 'plot', 'story', '.The', 'song', 'hear', 'people', 'sing', 'also', 'changed', 'not', 'better', 'song', 'should', 'be', 'Enjolras', 'call', 'arms', 'become', 'chorus', 'song', 'minimal', 'musical', 'impact', 'removal', 'song', ""'turning"", 'also', 'impact', 'revolution', 'movie', 'making', 'seem', 'no-one', 'Marius', 'bothered', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'enjoyed', 'visuals', 'were', 'amasing', 'times', 'concentarted', 'too', 'much', 'visuals', 'not', 'music', 'costumes', 'were', 'good', 'so', 'was', 'acting', 'unfortunatly', 'choice', 'make', 'actors', 'sing', 'live', 'made', 'more', 'emotional', 'made', 'singing', 'inconsistant', 'showed', 'struggles', 'actors', 'had', 'reaching', 'holding', 'notes.This', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'have', 'not', 'watched', ""'Les"", 'Mis', 'have', 'then', 'just', 'bare', 'mind', 'changes', 'are', 'made', 'are', 'very', 'specific', 'musical', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch']",N/A

999924,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000GAKLZI,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","To say that I was walking into this film with bias eyes may be a correct assumption.  I&#8217;ll be honest here, for there is not another movie in the history of film that I have been more excited to see than &#8216;Les Miserables&#8217;.  That isn&#8217;t to say that I expected it to be the greatest movie I had ever seen, but in all my years of movie watching, I have never anticipated the release of a film with such rabid obsession as I have with &#8216;Les Miserables&#8217;.  It probably stems back to my childhood and the fact that by the age of twelve I had already seen the stage musical four times and was pretty much obsessed with it as a whole.  Living a hop, skip and a jump away from many of the finest theaters in New England, my family frequented the theater.  I still remember the first time I saw &#8216;Les Miserables&#8217;.  I was seven.  It changed me.Musicals are, in my opinion, one of the greatest genres film has to offer.  They deliver to us such depth of storytelling in a way that is unique to its own.  You don&#8217;t see people running through the streets communicating in song and yet when it is done with such passion in front of the lens it all makes sense and feels so complete.When the initial reviews for &#8216;Les Miserables&#8217; started to flood in with largely negative notices, I was nervous.  How could this be a flop?  How could this material get butchered?  Not that it couldn&#8217;t, since we&#8217;ve all endured the mess that was 1998&#8217;s &#8216;Les Miserables&#8217;, but I still had faith that Hooper would do the source material proud.  In all honesty, most of the vicious attacks against the film felt so contrived and calculated that it was almost as if critics were anticipating a failure.  Nathanial Rogers over at The Film Experience noted this same thing.  Whether it be angst against Hooper for stealing Fincher&#8217;s Oscar (like it was his fault, but I get it sort of) or an aversion to the movie musical itself, it seemed since the start of the year that this particular film had a lot of naysayers before it was even finished being made.Well, Christmas rolled around and I got to see it for myself.I loved this movie!&#8216;Les Miserables&#8217; is not a film for everyone.  It&#8217;s funny to leave a theater and hear complaints from people behind me like &#8220;did they really have to sing everything&#8221; and I&#8217;m thinking to myself&#8230;IT&#8217;S A MUSICAL!  Seriously, if that is your complaint then why bother going to the movies.  I, for one, was thrilled when I heard that this was going to be completely sung throughout.  &#8216;Les Miserables&#8217; has some of the most beautiful songs and composed music that it deserves a faithful adaptation.  Hooper&#8217;s triumph is about as close as you can come.  Of course, no film is perfect and I am not blind to certain imperfections, but overall I was extremely pleased with this film and consider it a marvelous representation of what a true movie musical should and could be.What Hooper and company get right here is the tone of &#8216;Les Miserables&#8217;.  This film is about the depths of despair but also the rising power of hope that come blossom from redemption.  Jean Valjean, a man swallowed up by his past mistakes (and the looming oppression of injustice) is attempting to right his wrongs and turn his life around.  Being spared a life of slavery by the kind gesture of a Bishop, Valjean breaks his parole in pursuit of a life without chains and makes himself over as a wealthy mayor and business man.  There are two people in his life that cause unexpected friction and set his life spiraling into a different direction.  First is Fantine, a young woman trying to provide for her illegitimate child.  The second is Javert, the ruthless general who is in feverish pursuit of Jean Valjean.  As the years pass by Valjean&#8217;s guard is constantly up as he fights to evade Javert&#8217;s clutches, all the while taking on a new responsibility that opens his heart and teaches him the importance of love; something that has be choked out of his soul thanks to the heartless realities of life.For the fan of the source, Hooper&#8217;s film is going to make you smile.  I wept.  My parents wept.  In fact, the majority of the theater wept, and this is only the third time in my life when the theater broke into applause during the credits.  &#8216;Les Miserables&#8217; is an emotional wonderment and a film that will break you down.  The performances by the entire cast are wonderful, with Anne Hathaway delivering one of the finest supporting performance of the past several decades (her take on &#8216;I Dreamed a Dream&#8217; may be one of the finest cinematic moments, ever) and Eddie Redmayne completely taking me by surprise with the amount of depth and heart he brought to what could have been an easily dismissive role (loverboy).The pacing is also pretty spectacular.  The film just glides from one number to the next.  It certainly doesn't feel like a nearly three hour movie.  We are constantly drawn into each scene, not one feeling unnecessary.  This is a feat in itself, considering that this is a film consisting entirely of song and score and a lot of the score is redundant (and yet it is so beautifully composed that one never tires of hearing it).Some have balked at the vocals of some of the cast, in particular Russell Crowe.  To them I say this; film and theater are two very different things.  When one goes to the theater, they expect to hear voices that cause their hair to stand on end.  You are watching actors who are trained to sing to the cheap seats so-to-speak.  It is part of the experience.  Film is a different animal.  If this film were spoken word, you would expect the actors to dig deep.  You&#8217;d expect to hear their voices crack and their breath give out; why would you expect any less from a song?  It is very obvious that Hooper was going for a more realistic approach, a more earthy and grounded take on the musical.  Instead of expecting vocal perfection from his cast, Hooper wanted to unearth their emotional response to the story.  I mean, Hathaway goes as far as to suck snot up her nose as she belts out her big number, and it works.  Crowe, while not capable of hitting the big notes, has a very pleasant tone to his voice and handles himself quite well here.Yes, there are faults.  Hooper&#8217;s obsession with closeups is a bit overwhelming.  The film is so beautiful, from the costumes to the set pieces, that it is such a shame that for the most part &#8216;Les Miserables&#8217; basically shifts from one person&#8217;s face to another&#8217;s.  I understand it to a degree, since watching Hathaway crumble during &#8216;I Dreamed a Dream&#8217; in one take with no cuts and no makeup and full on pain works wonderfully, but it does become somewhat claustrophobic after a while.  It&#8217;s baffling to me that Hooper wouldn&#8217;t want to expand his view a bit and let us take in the vastness of the cityscape, especially since he did so quite effectively in &#8216;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8217;.This, and &#8216;Bring Him Home&#8217; is a terrible mess.At the end of the day, I loved this.  My parents even noted to me that it was better than the stage musical.  I don&#8217;t agree to that degree.  There are few things that can rival the power of this story told on the stage, but I feel that Tom Hooper and company captured it to the best of their ability.  I feel pretty confident that if the cinematography weren&#8217;t so monotonous (the dutch angles at least added some flamboyance to otherwise boring camera work) this film would be the clear frontrunner for the Oscar.",5,Sing it loud and proud!,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,7694,"['say', 'was', 'walking', 'film', 'bias', 'eyes', 'may', 'be', 'correct', 'assumption', '8217', 'be',

999925,A1EVD37ULFNOKU,B000GAKLZI,"Andrew Frankel ""Huge movie collector""","[0, 0]","This is one of those movies that captures the essence, adds the familiarity of the songs, and honors the story of the play and converts it into a movie. The movie should be judged as a separate entity. Those faithful to the Broadway Musical will absolutely have mixed feelings about this. I am not sure about the DVD, but the Blu-Ray has a Singing Live special feature and talks about how the cast sang live, and it also explains the differences between the play and the movie. Anne Hathaway described it best when she said "" I can't sing this pretty."" And she said it not to say she can't sing but instead it was an issue of believability. You just witnessed all the things Fantine had to go through and you can't believe that after all that this song would be sung pretty. I had never heard I dreamed a Dream sung that way before and it gave me a whole new feeling to a story thatI thought I knew pretty well. And It wasn't just Anne. All the cast really made this film extraordinary. Also in that same documentary, the actors could choose how to act and sing, and Eddie Raymond made a good point about how usually you pre record the music and then lip sync to it and the problem with that is you need to make acting choices months before meeting the cast, crew and sets, which doesn't necessarily match up when you are actually acting and engaging with the elements. The actors actually acted and did not just go through the emotions and lip sync to prerecorded material. At the last part of this behind the scenes, they show how the director and the conductor directed the orchestra in changing the way the music is played to fit the emotions and singing methods of the actors, and the songwriter for the broadway version was there to listen and give feedback, so they really covered all their bases. It was truly some of the best 10-20 minutes of behind the scenes footage I ever watched. As for Russell Crowe, because he is probably the most criticized, he is growing on me the more I watch this. Stars is my favorite song from the men, and it was a little rough the first time I heard it, but I have to say watching the movie over and over again, he seems to get better sounding to me, and he is a lot stronger by the time Javert's Suicide came on. His presence fit as Javert, afterall he was the Gladiator, but vocally I wish he was stronger, especially pitting him against Hugh Jackman who is vocally trained.In conclusion I absolutely love this movie and it should be judged separate from the play, and the actors really made the songs their own, which added a different dimension to the story and it's characters. 5 STARS TODAY AND ALWAYS!",5,A True Combination Of Broadway and Hollywood,1380240000,"09 27, 2013",2013,2650,"['one', 'movies', 'essence', 'familiarity', 'songs', 'honors', 'story', 'play', 'movie', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'separate', 'entity', 'faithful', 'Broadway', 'Musical', 'will', 'absolutely', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'Singing', 'Live', 'special', 'feature', 'talks', 'how', 'cast', 'sang', 'live', 'also', 'differences', 'play', 'movie', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'described', 'best', 'when', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'pretty', 'said', 'not', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'instead', 'was', 'issue', 'believability', 'just', 'witnessed', 'things', 'Fantine', 'had', 'go', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'song', 'would', 'be', 'sung', 'pretty', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'dreamed', 'Dream', 'sung', 'way', 'gave', 'whole', 'new', 'feeling', 'story', 'thatI', 'thought', 'knew', 'pretty', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'Anne', 'cast', 'really', 'made', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'Also', 'same', 'documentary', 'actors', 'could', 'choose', 'how', 'act', 'sing', 'Eddie', 'Raymond', 'made', 'good', 'point', 'how', 'usually', 'pre', 'record', 'music', 'then', 'lip', 'sync', 'problem', 'need', 'make', 'acting', 'choices', 'months', 'meeting', 'cast', 'crew', 'sets', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'match', 'up', 'when', 'are', 'actually', 'acting', 'engaging', 'elements', 'actors', 'actually', 'acted', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'go', 'emotions', 'lip', 'sync', 'prerecorded', 'material', 'last', 'part', 'scenes', 'show', 'how', 'director', 'conductor', 'directed', 'orchestra', 'changing', 'way', 'music', 'played', 'fit', 'emotions', 'singing', 'methods', 'actors', 'songwriter', 'broadway', 'version', 'was', 'there', 'listen', 'give', 'feedback', 'really', 'covered', 'bases', 'was', 'truly', 'best', '10-20', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'footage', 'ever', 'watched', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'probably', 'most', 'criticized', 'growing', 'more', 'watch', 'Stars', 'favorite', 'song', 'men', 'was', 'little', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'have', 'say', 'watching', 'movie', 'over', 'again', 'get', 'better', 'sounding', 'lot', 'stronger', 'time', 'Javert', 'Suicide', 'came', 'presence', 'fit', 'Javert', 'afterall', 'was', 'Gladiator', 'vocally', 'wish', 'was', 'stronger', 'especially', 'pitting', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'who', 'vocally', 'trained.In', 'conclusion', 'absolutely', 'love', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'separate', 'play', 'actors', 'really', 'made', 'songs', 'own', 'added', 'different', 'dimension', 'story', 'characters', '5', 'STARS', 'TODAY', 'AND', 'ALWAYS']",N/A

999934,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B000GAKLZI,Anthony L.,"[9, 11]","Okay reader, I'm going to tell you a little bit about what I thought about Les Miserables (2012), and will try to keep it shorter then the book was. Now, right off the bat I'm going to tell you that I LOVED Les Miserables, saw it twice, and that it's on my top 10 list of great films of 2012.So below I'm going to first tell you the stuff that was AWESOME in Les Mis, and then I'll go through some of the negative bits, because, although amazing, Les Mis is far from perfect.Shall we begin?1. WHO DOESN'T LIKE HUGH JACKMAN?Let's talk about the cast a little bit. First of all, Hugh Jackman is worthy of any and all praise you can throw his way. He plays a meaty role that almost singlehandedly carries a huge film with so much hype that even the hype was hyped, and does so with emotion and aplomb. Look for his standout moments in ""What Have I Done"" and ""One Day More"" and ""Bring Him Home"". His character development, especially his change from resentful convict to kind and just mayor, is handled with utmost skill, and I especially loved the evolution of his relationship with Crowe's Javert. Watching the two Aussie actors go head to head as in ""The Confrontation"" is riveting stuff.I'll talk a little about Crowe below, but I think he deserves a second mention. Say what you want about his singing (I loved it), but you can't deny he looks the part. Broad, tall, and intimidating, Javert IS. The. Law. Crowe perfectly embodies Javert's years of bottled-up vengeance, hatred, rigid adherence to rules, and unshakeable (albeit misplaced) honour.And I suppose Anne Hathaway deserves a LOT of mentioning. I mean, she won an Oscar - a well-deserved, hard earned Oscar! Just look at her heartbreaking rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" - in my opinion the best ever. Talk about method acting, Hathaway lost a lot of weight for her role, and had her hair shorn off onscreen. But it is completely worth it; her Fantine steals the scenes and is long in the audience's minds after she exits the film in the second quarter. If ""I Dreamed a Dream"" doesn't move you close to tears, you have a heart of ice.A few notes on the supporting cast:Amanda Seyfried: Didn't really work. Her portrayal came of as whiny and pampered. I mean, falling in love with a guy after seeing him for 10 seconds? Who does that? But her harmony in ""A Heart Full of Love"" was beautiful.Eddie Redmayne: Contender for best voice in the film? Best Marius I've ever seen, and he sure beat Nic Jonas in the 25th Anniversary Musical Production! Redmayne's stunning performance of ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" is perhaps the second best solo performance in the film, after Hathaway.Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen: As Monsieur and Madame Thenardier, Bonham Carter and Cohen provide most of the comic relief. They're entertaining, I'll give them that much, but do they ever go away?Aaron Tveit: When you're done throwing praise at Hugh Jackman, throw the rest to Aaron Tveit - he deserves it! His fiery young revolutionary Enjolras steals. the. SCENES. ""The ABC Cafe - Red and Black"" is my favourite song in the film. It's entertaining, catchy, and perfectly sung! And his death scene is one of the most poignant and rousing scenes in the film. Stellar work, Aaron!Samantha Barks: And last, but by no means least, Samantha Barks was a perfect Eponine. She lived an almost absurdly sad life, but Barks (who played the character on stage before) sang beautifully, almost angelically. Her heartbreaking performance of ""On My Own"" is emotional and memorable. A most underrated actress!Extra callouts go to the little kids who played Gavroche and Cosette, and to Colm Wilkinson (The Bishop of D) - one of the first Valjeans in the musical.2. LES COSTUMES, LES DECORS, ET LA CINEMATOGRAPHIESum up what Les Miserables LOOKS like in 3 words: Grey. Bleak. Dirty. Take Anne Hathaway for instance; one minute clean and neat, the next dirty, caked in dirt, and in sore need of a bath. Take Hugh Jackman, crawling through the sewers. If your stomach didn't roil as he slogs through 5 and a half feet of sewage, you're a stronger man then me.And that's precisely where Les Miserables succeeds: in the costume department, in the makeup department, in the cinematography department. One critic mentioned that it took a lot of hard work to make Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway look so ugly. It takes an equal amount of hard work to make 50 extras look like 18th Century French gutter rats. It takes an equal amount of hard work to transform a concrete warehouse into the streets of Paris. It takes an equal amount of to make a film look so real, so dirty, so accurate. It takes an equal amount of work to design, sew, and age army uniforms for 50 extras.So lets give a big round of applause to the unsung heroes of cinema - the makeup artists, the set decorators, the costume designers, and the cinematographers!3. CAN YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE SING?Now here's something I've wanted to do for a long time: Rank the excellent songs in Les Miserables. So here you have it: the 10 best songs in Les Miserables, according to me:10. The Confrontation - Javert and Valjean sing in counterpoint, and the result is fast-paced and entertaining.9. What Have I Done - A heartfelt, emotional song by Hugh Jackman, with an amazing finish.8. A Heart Full of Love - People, take notes. THIS is how to do a harmony, and the result is nothing short of angelic.7. Javert's Suicide - I don't know what I love more about this song. The fact that Javert dies, or the fact that Crowe gives such an AMAZING performance.6. Do You Hear the People Sing - A patriotic, catchy, inspiring, thundering song that make you want to sing along and shout ""Vive la France!""5. Who Am I? / The Trial - I never realized how damn good this song was until I saw Les Mis a second time. It starts slow and contemplative, but the ending - ""2-4-6-0-1!"" is positively thrilling.4. Empty Chairs at Empty Tables - A sad song, sadly but beautifully sung by Eddie Redmayne. Emotional and haunting.3. Red and Black - A rousing, entertaining, catchy song, sung glouriously by Redmayne, Tveit, and company.2. One Day More - A brilliant, blood-stirring, rousing piece sung by almost everyone in the film. Starts slow, ends with you leaping up and cheering with your fist in the air.1. I Dreamed A Dream - Could it really be anything else? Anne Hathaway gives such a raw, emotional performance; it's beautiful.4. CAN YOU HEAR THE AUDIENCE CRY?In my opinion, Les Miserables - the book, the play, the film - is timeless.Almost everyone in the audience went into Les Mis having read the book, or studied it in school, or watched a film, or seen the musical. They knew what to expect. For months before the film was even released, hype built up to an almost unimaginable level.And yet the beauty and brilliance of the film is that it astounded and moved us once more.And it does move us. It completely and utterly justifies it's name as The Miserables. We accurately (if romantically) see the hardships and trials of living in post-Revolution France. Much of the film is bleak and grey.And yet in the hardship; moments of striking, startling beauty. The moon shining on Javert as he stands at the top of a tower. Candlelight shining on Cosette as she sings in her room. Hundreds of revolutionaries singing on a huge barricade in the sunshine.All this adds up to a very emotional, heavy experience. Many of the audience left teary-eyed. We have Tom Hooper to thank for this. He took a classic tale, and created something new, moving, and astonishing! It's brilliant.And now for the cons. The things that didn't work in Les Miserables:CONS:1. I YAWNED A YAWN AS TIME WENT BY...Les Miserables is undoubtedly too long. Admittedly, Les Miserables the BOOK by Victor Hugo is, when translated, the 14th longest novel in the English language; and clocks in at around the 1,500 page mark.Les Miserables the MOVIE clocks in at just over 2 and a half hours.Now don't get me wrong - I'm a fan of long movies. All my favourite movies are over the 2 1/2 hour mark and some clock in at over 4 hours (The Return of the King, Lawrence of Arabia, Seven Samurai). And compared to the book, Les Mis is like a Sparknotes summary. It's a little over 10 minutes longer then The Avengers, and it's shorter then The Hobbit; yet those two movies keep you riveted till the credits roll!Not Les Miserables. We drag through the doldrums of Valjean's sad sad life, then come to Fantine's sad sad life, then to Cosette's sad sad life, then Eponine's sad sad SAD life, and finally we slog through the sad sad post-climactic wedding and death scenes. It just feels so LONG!The second time I watched it I leaned back in my cinema seat, rolled my eyes back in my sockets, and began to wish that someone - ANYONE - would quit singing and start talking.And that leads me to my next con. (Trust me, this won't go on forever.)2. SING TALKING...Oh my god, where to begin? This is one of those things that really shook my faith in the film, like, to it's roots. I cringed, I gagged, I rolled my eyes, I groaned. It's what I call ""Sing talking"". The worst scenes in the film are the ones where Valjean and Javert carry out these little conversations in song. They sing their introductions, they sing their insults, they sing their questions...they sing everything, and the worst part?What they sing in 3 seconds could be said in 1. What could have been short and sweet is now long and dreary.And now for my last con:3. RUSSELL CROWEJust kidding. Russell Crowe is not a con. He's awesome. Why is everyone harping on about Russell Crowe? He is the only professional singer among the main cast, the only one to win an Oscar, the only one to play Maximus Decimus Meridius.Any criticism directed at him should actually be aimed at the director, because 1.They make him sing too high, and 2. They only give him two songs in which he can use his signature booming voice.Amanda Seyfried on the other hand...has a really annoying soprano like a Barbie doll. I didn't like her solo performances, but her together with Eddie Redmayne and Samantha Barks = harmony heaven.P.S. Some (just SOME) of the camera work; held up reeaaal close and shaky, in Hooper's signature style does not fit the style or theme of the film. It does capture emotion excellently, though. I also find his overuse of Dutch angles in wide shots somewhat cheap and completely unfitting.CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Les Miserables isn't perfect. It's too long, bombastic, ragged, and features some questionable singing. But you won't care at all. Les Miserables, with it's fine cast and accurate visual style, will move you, sadden you, uplift you, and entertain you.Les Miserables is un triomphe!Vive le Tom Hooper!",4,Please Consider THIS Review

999937,AO80JEDFYS6MJ,B000GAKLZI,A. Reader,"[1, 1]","This is one of those movies that no matter what someone says about it, they're right.  The concept is interesting and well-worth seeing for fans of the musical.  But, for those who haven't seen the stage musical, this could be one of the longest movies they've ever seen.  The movie is shorter than the musical, and the cuts have made the transitions difficult at times.  And, because things that work with the staging of a musical don't work the same way for movies, there are odd parts that might be flat out annoying for some people.I thought the approach to the music was interesting.  The actors are definitely acting WHILE singing, which gives a new perspective to many of the songs.  If this were my only exposure to ""Les Miserables,"" I think I'd be disappointed.  But I've seen it a few times, so I liked seeing a different adaptation.  But, stage purists may hate this version.The music was mixed.  I had heard so much about Russell Crowe's singing that I was prepared to be appalled, but Russell Crowe CAN sing--he just isn't Broadway material.  He hits all his notes, though I've heard much better versions of the songs.  But I'll bet he's quite good singing pop songs or oldies.  Hugh Jackman is a very talented man, though I'm afraid Colm Wilkinson has so completely set the bar for Jean Valjean for me that no one has ever quite lived up to the original for me.  Still, I enjoyed seeing Jackman's take on the part and he's certainly no slouch.  I thought Anne Hathaway was wonderful as Fantine, though so many of the cuts involved her story that I think her story might be the most confusing part for anyone who hasn't seen the stage version.  I didn't care for Amanda Seyfried's singing, but that's just personal preference.  She's quite talented and certainly others will enjoy her performance.  The only true complaint I had was the Thenardiers.  I love Helena Bonham Carter as an actress, but if one has a well-trained ear, it's obvious she's missing some of her notes.  I'd have much rather seen her in something else as a major character as an actress than a small part in a musical.  As she was also cast in ""Sweeney Todd,"" it seems that her acting ability is strong enough to carry singing parts by Hollywood standards, but at least in dvds one can skip over scenes one doesn't want to watch.I think it's well worth seeing, but some people are definitely going to hate this movie.  Perhaps that's the mark of truly taking a new approach to material--they chose not to take a ""safe"" route and I think it's worth seeing for that alone.",4,Worth Seeing,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,2555,"['one', 'movies', 'matter', 'what', 'someone', ""'re"", 'right', 'concept', 'interesting', 'well-worth', 'seeing', 'fans', 'musical', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'stage', 'musical', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'longest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'shorter', 'musical', 'cuts', 'have', 'made', 'transitions', 'difficult', 'times', 'things', 'work', 'staging', 'musical', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'same', 'way', 'movies', 'are', 'odd', 'parts', 'might', 'be', 'flat', 'out', 'annoying', 'people.I', 'thought', 'approach', 'music', 'was', 'interesting', 'actors', 'are', 'definitely', 'acting', 'singing', 'new', 'perspective', 'many', 'songs', 'were', 'only', 'exposure', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'disappointed', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'liked', 'seeing', 'different', 'adaptation', 'stage', 'purists', 'may', 'hate', 'version.The', 'music', 'was', 'mixed', 'had', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'singing', 'was', 'prepared', 'be', 'appalled', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'CAN', 'sing', 'just', ""n't"", 'Broadway', 'material', 'notes', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'much', 'better', 'versions', 'songs', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'quite', 'good', 'singing', 'pop', 'songs', 'oldies', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'very', 'talented', 'man', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'so', 'completely', 'set', 'bar', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'one', 'ever', 'quite', 'lived', 'up', 'original', 'Still', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Jackman', 'take', 'part', 'certainly', 'slouch', 'thought', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Fantine', 'so', 'many', 'cuts', 'involved', 'story', 'think', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'confusing', 'part', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'stage', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'singing', 'just', 'personal', 'preference', 'quite', 'talented', 'certainly', 'others', 'will', 'enjoy', 'performance', 'only', 'true', 'complaint', 'had', 'was', 'Thenardiers', 'love', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'actress', 'one', 'well-trained', 'ear', 'obvious', 'missing', 'notes', ""'d"", 'have', 'much', 'rather', 'seen', 'something', 'else', 'major', 'character', 'actress', 'small', 'part', 'musical', 'was', 'also', 'cast', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'acting', 'ability', 'strong', 'enough', 'carry', 'singing', 'parts', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'least', 'dvds', 'one', 'can', 'skip', 'scenes', 'one', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch.I', 'think', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'people', 'are', 'definitely', 'going', 'hate', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'mark', 'truly', 'taking', 'new', 'approach', 'material', 'chose', 'not', 'take', 'safe', 'route', 'think', 'worth', 'seeing', 'alone']",N/A

999946,A1VBMM3SCBOA9M,B000GAKLZI,B. Cooper,"[1, 1]","Les Miserables is quite simply the best musical made to date.  The casting is superb, the music and orchestral composition is phenomenal, and the set design and acting is top-notch.  I have seen Les Miserables on Broadway three times, and I would EASILY say this is just as good as any of those performances.  With the thrill of seeing a live-performance aside, I would even dare to say it is better!  Can I give any higher praise than that?!  If you have a great surround set-up, then you owe it to yourself and your family to purchase this film.Tom Hooper made one of the most brilliant decisions when directing this film - to have the actors sing each number as they acted, rather than to dub their performances with studio music afterwards.  I CANNOT STRESS how much this impacted the film in a positive way, and I cannot believe other directors have not utilized this in the past.  I was skeptical about having prominent actors such as Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe cast into such well-known singing roles, but I believe they did an exceptional job.  Russell Crowe's singing may have been the weakest in terms of solo performances, BUT his acting is EXTREMELY powerful for the role.  In the end, I found that I really believed him as Javert and appreciated the fact that he was chosen for the cast.  He serves as a fantastic foil for Jackman's Jean Valjean.If you don't like musicals, then even a stellar film such as this will not change your perception.  But if you do, let me tell you that this is a movie that is powerful beyond words.  The staging, casting, color saturation, cinematography, singing and instrumentation are simply off the charts.  Samantha Barks's rendition of ""On My Own"" is better than any of the three Broadway shows I have seen, and Eddie Redmayne did a standout job as Marius.  I was moved to tears several times, and felt like giving a standing ovation following the film - and this is from my living room, watching the movie by myself with surround sound.  I am not a sentimental person either.  Wow!  Jeez..I'm still reeling with shock from how fantastic everything was - right up to the final chorus.I urge you to view this movie for yourself, and to see it through from start to finish.  This is not simply another rendition of Les Miserables, it is THE BEST rendition of Les Miserables.  If you are not a believer by the final note, then you may want to consult a local audiologist to test your hearing.

I don't understand the appeal of musicals either on stage or on screen.A musical is exactly that- a story that is based entirely around singing and dancing.  The problem usually is that the music is overbearingly pretentious and cringeworthy (but to be fair, not always terrible) and that's what makes Les Miserables a chore to sit through.  It's not bad in the beginning, but about halfway through the music losses its sense of melody and joy and instead feels like a bunch of people showing off by hitting all the high notes for an extended period of time.  It gets on my nerves.  Not a preference of mine.Another problem is that, with Les Miserables in particular, the melodies are really derivative of other sources.  Many of these songs remind me of the rock operas that bands such as Jethro Tull, Queen and the Who had done.  Yes I realize rock and music theater are two separate beasts, but it doesn't change the fact that the vocal melodies themselves are similar.  One melody that Russell Crowe sings near the beginning even sounds exactly like the Bee Gee's ""Words"".Another problem is that spending a considerable amount of time hitting nothing but high notes makes it near impossible to make out the actual words being sung and as you know, in order to follow a story you need to hear and understand the words.  But... in this case, you can't.  It's not just because of the constant use of high notes either- sometimes the melodies are sung too darn fast, or there's too many people singing at the same time.  Plus there's a strange accent to most of these songs.  Sounds like a fake attempt to sound British.  It's weird.  Either way 60% of the words are hard to understand.  Perhaps grabbing a lyrics sheet would make it easier to follow along.I find it sometimes annoying that *every* *single* *line* has to be sung.  Sometimes I think given the lackluster vocal melodies on a few occasions, that it would have been better to speak instead of sing those lines.  These lackluster parts are obviously included as a way to build into the next segment and theme, but still.  It feels awkward more often than not.For those of you that think this movie version is too violent or inappropriate.  Well, compared to most things on TV these days, not really.  Les Miserables is mild in comparison.  I imagine a general feeling when it comes to musicals is an expectation of good-hearted acting and singing, and that's the main reason people are making a big deal about the few sexual related segments.Les Miserables is still decent.  That's why it gets a 3-star rating.

999963,A2NI9BFPKAFAZ0,B000GAKLZI,Blago Jones,"[7, 14]","Why you shouldn't see it:You probably heard that Les Miserables is a musical. For the uninitiated, in this case, ""musical"" means nary a line is spoken. All dialog, internal or otherwise, is conveyed to the audience via song (and occasional dance). So if that sort of thing bothers you, I can't imagine that you'll get much of a kick out of this. But really, you've been fairly warned. I may be alone in this, but I think having an entirely musical movie is dangerous territory to tread, because of the difficult balancing act between having catchy tunes and songs that actually advance the plot. It seems like being catchy requires a hook, and most hooks are repetitive, and repetitive things don't really progress. Aside from that, the occasional downside of the musical format is partly inaudible dialog, which in turn stunts the progression of the plot for your mind if you didn't prepare for your film/play-watching by reading the Wikipedia article.Speaking of which, if you do happen to peruse the Wikipedia article, you may surmise that this film is in fact based on a stage musical, which in turn was based on a novel. And not just any novel. A five part, 1500 page, 530,000 word novel that spans nearly 20 years and appears on Wikipedia's list of longest novels, right alongside the likes of War and Peace and Atlas Shrugged. In an industry that typically struggles to compress 150 page novels into two hour movies, I'm wondering what brilliant individual saw this piece that was ten times longer as a two and a half hour trip to the theater.Apologies in advance, as I'm well aware that Les Mis is a wildly popular stage production... I guess the above is more of a gripe with the original musical mind that saw the novel and decided to turn it into a play. From a story standpoint, the heavily downsized movie version seems disjointed to me, with the main culprits being the two times the screen just flashed the words ""Nine years later..."" How is this all one story? It isn't. It's five stories with common characters. Everything - namely the characters and their relations to one another - just comes across as abrupt when they change.  I'm assuming these transitions are either more gradual or are presented in a manner more sensical in the novel, but in a shortened version, they only confused me. Really, I'm trying to figure out how the play became so popular, and I'm leaning toward the music being the key.While the music may have been the strength for the play, it was fairly hit or miss in the movie. The play had the benefit of being sung by professional singers in a fashion that was very friendly to pretty-sounding performances. In the movie, movie stars were used for the main roles, and the stylistic choices could be boiled down to the fact that the director wanted his actors to act their scenes, not merely sing them. The result is uneven at best, with Amanda Seyfried having a pretty yet limited voice, Russell Crowe having both an awkward and a limited voice, and people like Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen not even really attempting to sing.Why you should see it:This is apparently a highly controversial point, but the main reason I would recommend anyone to see this movie is really just for the moments with Anne Hathaway, and, specifically, her rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream."" This was an instance where the director's desire to have his actors act really paid off in my opinion, and I couldn't avoid getting goosebumps when I saw it. Some people will point to other performances of said song as much prettier renditions, but this is a woman in complete despair... Why would she sing beautifully in this moment? Anyway, I thought that one scene alone was fantastic and deserving of Hathaway's Oscar nod (and probable win).Some of the other casting is also well-done, with Hugh Jackman (nominated), Samantha Barks (nominated for other awards) and Eddie Redmayne (nominated for other awards) as obvious examples. Each was able to properly portray their character with appropriate enough musical inclination to also sing their pieces well.Those songs happen to be, as with many things about this movie, hit or miss. Some are fun and catchy, and others appear to be mostly expository and had a harder time sticking with me, a first time viewer/listener. I also understand that the film took quite a few liberties with the original music, editing and remixing it so that it is definitely a different interpretation of the material.Otherwise, the production value for this movie is great. When the opening number started, I got pretty excited about the scale of it all. I'm also pretty fond of the movie poster (shown above), which did a great job at capturing my imagination with Cosette's almost haunting eyes. The strange thing about this big budget, large scale production is that the director spends a lot of time showing the audience very little other than the face of the person who is presently singing.In Short:My main complaint about Les Miserables is actually kind of strange, considering the fact that my favorite movie of the year may very well have been Cloud Atlas, but it seems like simply has too much plot to be boiled down into 2.5 hours. The only real reasons I would consider to be must-see for this particular fare would be if you're either a musical fan not familiar with the original stage production or a super fan who needs all things Les Mis. In light of that, I give it my first take-it-or-leave-it recommendation, and rated it a 6 out of 10 mostly for the efforts of Hathaway and Jackman (on whom I have a slight man crush), and the fact that having exposure to a culturally significant work such as this can do a person some good.Now for the awkward part. Since I gave a middle of the road recommendation, I suppose this portion needs both reasons to see and not to see the movie. Let's give it a shot. Exceptions to the recommendation:- If you would if you could live your life by breaking out into seemingly random song and dance without getting funny looks, see it.- If you're a Francophobe, don't see it.- If you're a Francophile, see it.- I could have those last two backward, since the movie title pretty well lays the groundwork for miserable French people... I guess it depends on how much you love or hate and/or identify with French people. (Random true story: after the movie, I heard one gentleman say to another: ""I didn't know it was going to be such a sad movie."")- So if you really hate those cheese eating surrender monkeys and enjoy watching them suffer, reverse the second and third bullet points.- If the idea of all French people having English accents bothers you, don't see it.- If you can appreciate a movie due to one especially powerful scene, see it.- If Russell Crowe singing in one nasally note bothers you, don't see it.- If you just really enjoy large scale productions, see it.- If the idea of a large scale production with an inordinate number of prolonged close ups bothers you, don't see it.- If you like to take in stories by just skipping over large chunks of them and inserting ""Nine years later..."" exposition, see it.- If you think Anne Hathaway has beautiful hair, don't see it.- If you've somehow seen every other best picture nominee, and this is the only feather missing from your cap, you may as well bite the bullet and see it.",3,For Fans and Noobs Only,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,7346,"['Why', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'probably', 'heard', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'musical', 'uninitiated',

The Broadway version is made of singers who also act.  This movie version is made of actors who also sing. There's a difference. But there's no mistaking that the actors are also singers. Some people don't know that Hugh Jackman is, in fact, a singer and dancer. Ann Hathaway has a lovely voice and grew up seeing her mother in her role on tour, so Hathaway knows the part by heart. Crowe's voice - He's in a rock band and does sing. But his voice is more of a talking version of his songs. This is normal for movies (like My Fair Lady), but for some reason, people don't seem to give Crowe the credit for that. He was great. Lots of meaning in his voice as he sang his songs (because he's a good actor). The makeup and stage settings were awesome. The whole thing was as realistic as this play can be.

Valjean is released, but he breaks parole, and is haunted by Javert, the ruthless policeman. Valjean agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's daughter, Cosette. This begins a remarkable journey for them all....""It is nothing to die. It is frightful not  to live(Victor Hugo)"". An enormous, loud, wrenching tale set in revolution-torn France, ""Les Miserables"" is Tom Hooper's cinema-splendor, based on the 1980 musical that is still being performed in London today. ""Les Miserables"" packed houses on Broadway from 1987 to 2003, and came back in 2006. It is the third longest-running musical in Broadway history. Victor Hugo's 1862 novel has been the subject of some 60 film and TV adaptions. Two American versions in the 1930's and 1950's starred Frederic March and Charles Laughton. Raymond Bernard's 1934 French version, in two parts, lasts 4 1/2 hours, and is classic. This new ""LM"" stars Hollywood actors Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe(excellent) and Sacha Cohen(very funny), all singing for themselves. 25 minutes in, Anne Hathaway, as Fantine, delivers an up-close, one-take rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"", a 4 1/2 minute song rich in power and tragedy; power in song that has rarely split the cinema; not ever so hardly in song.Hardly. Like Baz Luhrmann's great 2001 ""Moulin Rouge"", ""LM"" has sweeping musical set-pieces mounted in CGI, rotoscope, miniatures, and matte paintings; filmed in France, and London's Pinewood Studios. The DVD is glorious, a two-disc blue-ray release, with commentaries, Victor Hugo features, and production shorts. Long and sad, ""LM"" captures the genius of Victor Hugo, and along the way, it captures us all. ""To love another person is to see the face of God(V.

I remember seeing the trailers and seeing that this was going to be an epic movie. This movie makes me happy although it's very depressing. A lot of people die in the film. It's a great story that I love. The story fascinates me. I love the epic rivalry of Valjean and Javert. Valjean is Good and Javert is evil. Jackman's best role ever. Crowe and him were perfect to go one on one. I think everyone can relate to Valjean.Valjean is a good person who made a small mistake by stealing a loaf of bread and thus is treated like he was a bad criminal. Javert is ignorant and lives only by the law. He won't understand or be willing to look at it in any way but his own. Crowe actually plays Javert in an interesting way. Although he is very intense and scary at times there is a softness in his character that you sometimes see that make you not completely dislike him. In his final encounter with Valjean you feel it in his eyes and body. He realizes Valjean was a good man and he couldn't use the law to give him admittance to arrest Valjean. Valjean had saved Javert's life the night before. Javert slowly comes to terms with the fact his whole life has been a sham. He had done the wrong thing. What he did was terrible and the fact he couldn't live by the law anymore he takes his own life.Valjean is a great kind man who saves Cosette from the poor treatment from the innkeepers who are shady and sketchy characters. Borat as the lone person in the film with a French accent does a good job. Anne Hathaway gave a great performance but she was only in the film for a brief time. I was sad that Valjean died in the end. I would have preferred him to live to marry or just spend more time with Cosette and Marius.I love the character of Eponine I think every person in the world can relate to her. Everyone has had some growing up that they really liked but they didn't have the same feelings for us. She is the definition of unrequited love. I really wanted her character to end up with Marius. I thought it was terrible she died in the film. It's one of the major blows in the film. Samantha Barks did a great job as Eponine.I thought the acting was great in this film. I rate Jackman first, Hathaway second and Crowe third in best in film. I felt Jackman was the heart of the film as Hathaway was the soul. Crowe gave a great overlooked performance which is understandable giving Hathaway and Jackman's epic performances. I have seen the film so many times and it has inspired me so much.For a depressing film it gave me a lot of happiness. Seeing Valjean as a good man fighting against the evil man Javert while trying to live a noble and good life was awesome. It's a great story. It's a story that grows popular with every generation and it will live forever. From the start of the film it is just an adrenaline rush and it's quite an emotional ride you get taken on and in the end you may have run out of kleenex but it's a powerful film that will stick with you for many years after viewing it!

The beloved master piece comes alive with great visual, staging, costuming and talent. For the most part. The central premise of the story is that life isn't fair, and this movie brings it home. Some people can sing and some shouldn't. Now, going into it you already know that it is a musical, that the film is close to three hours in length and that there is a possibility that you won't stand it. I'm in the group of liking the movie albeit with reservations. Hugh Jackman's Valjean is lucky to be a strong man because &#34;they&#34; carry the brunt of the whole story from beginning to end. Mr. Jackman's performance is well rounded and he could actually sing. Anne Hathaway is Fantine, she's got down the emaciated and fragile persona down so well, you know where her career is going. Her rendition of the dream song was moving and full of emotion. So then we have Russell Crowe. Geez. He must have been very constipated during filming, worst Jalvert ever. He reminded me of Meatloaf sans the facial expressions. They could've tried harder, but I guess they needed star power. Really, it's not like musicals are that popular. Then there's Amanda Seyfried, her vibrating shrills were just abominable, we know she's there because she's eye candy, or trying to pull in a tween base. The other singing cast was so much better that you really feel sorry for her. It's an ok movie if you agree to all of that, if not you probably can find a better use for a few hours.",4,Good but...,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",2013,1543,"['Finally', 'got', 'see', '34', 'Les', 'Miserables', '34', 'latest', 'reincarnation', 'beloved', 'master', 'piece', 'alive', 'great', 'visual', 'staging', 'costuming', 'talent', 'most', 'part', 'central', 'premise', 'story', 'life', ""n't"", 'fair', 'movie', 'home', 'people', 'can', 'sing', 'should', ""n't"", 'Now', 'going', 'already', 'know', 'musical', 'film', 'close', 'three', 'hours', 'length', 'possibility', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', ""'m"", 'group', 'liking', 'movie', 'reservations', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Valjean', 'lucky', 'be', 'strong', 'man', '34', '34', 'carry', 'brunt', 'whole', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'Mr.', 'Jackman', 'performance', 'well', 'rounded', 'could', 'actually', 'sing', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Fantine', 'got', 'down', 'emaciated', 'fragile', 'persona', 'down', 'so', 'well', 'know', 'where', 'career', 'going', 'rendition', 'dream', 'song', 'was', 'moving', 'full', 'emotion', 'So', 'then', 'have', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Geez', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'constipated', 'filming', 'worst', 'Jalvert', 'ever', 'reminded', 'Meatloaf', 'facial', 'expressions', 'could', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'harder', 'guess', 'needed', 'star', 'power', 'Really', 'not', 'like', 'musicals', 'are', 'popular', 'Then', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'vibrating', 'shrills', 'were', 'just', 'abominable', 'know', 'there', 'eye', 'candy', 'trying', 'pull', 'tween', 'base', 'other', 'singing', 'cast', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'really', 'feel', 'sorry', 'ok', 'movie', 'agree', 'not', 'probably', 'can', 'find', 'better', 'use', 'few', 'hours']",N/A

999994,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B000GAKLZI,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[2, 2]","Awesome. Brilliant. Many have been the cinematic adaptations of Victor Hugo's classic ""Les Mis&eacute;rables,"" and for good reason. This is a powerful, moral story that needs to be kept alive for generations to come. But what it makes it much risky as a film, given the current trend in audiences' tastes, is to make it a musical. And that is precisely what director Tom Hooper did. The result is just fantastic, grandiose, unforgettable, and one for the ages.The story begins in 1815, where we are told that ""twenty six years after the start of the French revolution, a king is once again on the throne of France."" Right away we watch the now famous scene in which Jean Valjean (an unrecognizable Hugh Jackman) and hundreds of fellow prisoners are painfully pushing a gigantic ship into an empty dock, under the unmerciful surveillance of ruthless policeman Javert (Russell Crowe). Once the day is over and the huge task completed, Valjean is finally granted his freedom, being labeled ""a dangerous man, on parole forever."" His crime: stealing a loaf of bread years ago, to feed his sister's son. Fast forward to 1823, and we find Valjean as a successful business man, who owns a factory where they manufacture religious artifacts - he was helped by a priest during his days after release. Unbeknown to him, Fantine (Anne Hathaway), one of the workers at the factory, was fired because she was pregnant. Sadly, she became a prostitute afterward, under the eyes of lowlifes Th&eacute;nardier (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Madame Th&eacute;nardier (Helena Bonham Carter). While she works, the Th&eacute;nardiers have her daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen) also working as a slave under very unsanitary conditions. Sadly, Fantine dies, and Valjean, remorsefully, decides to take care of Cosette. Sadly, too, Javert shows up and finds out that Valjean is around, so he goes after him with a vengeance. We then move on to 1832, when a revolution is boiling in Paris, were the poor are fighting the rich. We now find Cosette grown up (this time played by Amanda Seyfried), and, while her father is trying to evade Javert during some turmoil, she catches the eye of Marius (Eddie Redmayne), a well-to-do young man who happens to be involved in the revolutionary movement, but in favor of the poor. Javert, meanwhile and more than ever, is trying to capture Valjean at any cost.Whether or not you like musicals - and I don't, for most part --, you'll surely embrace ""Les Mis&eacute;rables,"" even though 95% of the dialogue is done by singing. Everything works: the acting, the cinematography, the music, the production design, and, of course, the unforgettable and timeless story. The Blu-ray + DVD + Digital copy edition is awesome as well, loaded with extras, with features about the stars, locations, music, production design, commentary by director Hooper, and more. Needles to say, the film was nominated for 8 Academy Awards, and won 3 Golden Globe Awards.

It would be hard to imagine that anyone could do a better job than Tom Hooper has done for the film version.  I serisouly doubt any other filmmaker could do better.  We also have a dream cast.  Far from days when movie stars who couldn't sing were used in these movies, both Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway are known for their voices. (I don't know if anyone else can remember Elizabeth Taylor singing as the lead in the film musical adaptation of A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC.  Putting a non singer in the lead ruined it and now no one will remake the film.)A critical deicision was made NOT to prerecord the music but to sing it live and in performance.

While visually the film is great, the majority of the performances left me cold and I will break each one down; starting with...Hugh Jackman...The Tony Award winning Aussie wins the role of a lifetime as our hero Jean Valjean. I had such high hopes when I heard this casting, giving Jackman's background and left the theater with his performance getting the title of ""Biggest Letdown."" Vocally I feel this role was TOO big for even Jackman (just watch him attempt ""Bring Him Home""). I will keep saying indefinitely that I feel he could have NAILED Javert instead, which leads me to...Russell Crowe...I actually give the man an A for Effort, given he had the least amount of musical experience of all the main cast. His ""acting"" makes up for his lack of singing experience.However, part of the strength of Javert in the musical IS his songs.Anne Hathaway...While she was the surprise performance of the film I DO have some issues of her portrayal of the doomed Fantine. I feel Tom Hopper completely wanted to make Fantine a victim the entire time she is on screen, far from who Fantine is in the stage show, and all culminating with ""I Dreamed A Dream."" This is a song sung by a women who has not quite reached the bottom and still holds out hope but when Anne Hathaway sings it; you feel Fantine has all but given up on herself and her reason for living-Cosette.Sasha Baron Cohan and Helena Bonham Carter...My vote for second biggest letdowns. These two CAN sing and had the chance to knock these parts out of the park-especially Helena. Listening to ""Master Of The House"" I couldn't believe what I was hearing (and seeing-i.e. the Santa scene). The song is supposed to be upbeat, bouncy, and yet I couldn't help but feel Sasha and Helena were held back and couldn't be who the characters are really like.Amanda Seyfried...First off, I don't get what is with the hate. When it was announced that this film WAS happening; she was one of two roles I saw cast early on. She may not have the best voice for this type of musical (she shined in Mamma Mia)but she epitomises what older Cosette is about-innocence and a young women coming into her own.Samantha Barks...She was hands down the best performance of the adult leads! I see nothing but good things for this young women who went from second runner up on a BBC talent show to West End star and now prepped to take on Hollywood.Eddie Redemyer...Another performance that went from really bad in the beginning (the vibrato) to very moving in the end (second best ""Empty Chairs"" I've heard).Die hard fans will notice the cuts in the songs or rearranging the songs (which HIGHLY annoyed me-especially key parts). Unnecessary scenes (again, the ""Santa scene,"" if you've seen the movie you know the scene.

1000019,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000GAKLZI,Chris Kennison,"[6, 8]","One hundred and fifty years ago, Victor Hugo wrote the novel for ""Les Miserables"" and it has been told and retold many ways and in many fashions. This film version has been in the works for almost as long as the story spans in years. That would be thirty. The sweeping scope and scale of its premise, I would guess are not the reason for the delay, but the method of story-telling was most likely polarizing and some movie studio finally said, ""Oh, why not.""This version is like no other. It is a reflection of the stage musical, in which everything is sung. Dialogue and songs are blended together. To make things even trickier, much of the movie was filmed and portrayed live. The music was played on set and the actors were saddled with singing the songs without cuts and bringing the required emotion to it, as actors. At times, this technique is brilliant and beautiful, and at times the risk of this technique rears its ugly head. One thing can be said, this is an incredibly gutsy attempt at filmmaking by director Tom Hooper and there are moments so gut-wrenching and emotional they leave you breathless.Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman and Amanda Seyfried are actors who are meant for the stage. The casting of these three actor/actress' is none short of brilliant. Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Fantine is perfect and her performance of the popular song, ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is so good, you hang on every word of it, feeling every drenching gasp of her emotions. Amanda Seyfried's portrayal of Cosette is simply defined by her method of singing. Her voice is full of a rare combination of soul, peace and beauty, exactly what Cosette should be.  Hugh Jackman plays Jean Valjean, a man who spent 19-years in prison for stealing bread for his dying sister. There is really nothing to be said about his performance, other than brilliant. He was meant for this.I would be amiss not to mention Eddie Redmayne as well for his performance as Marius Pontmercy. Much has been said publicly and nationally about the other three stars in this film, but Pontmercy holds his own along-side Hathaway, Jackman and Seyfried.""Les Miserables"" is gifted with beautiful voices, but at times, as an audience member, you become aware of the length of the movie. There are many songs that sound alike and much of the time when the actors are singing their dialogue, it all sounds the same and monotonous.  There are moments in this film that are absolutely epic in scale and simplicity and there are moments that will drag you down to snooze land.""Les Miserables"" is not for the moviegoer who thinks they would like to try and see if they like musicals. If you don't typically like musicals or musical theatre, you will most likely not enjoy it. Although if you do, you will want to trudge through some of the heavier and slower parts of this movie to get to the moments of greatness that occur.

1000020,AN9J46667D80O,B000GAKLZI,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[6, 8]","This is the first time I've ever seen the musical version of Les Miserables. This is something of a surprise, because around 21 years ago I listened to the full soundtrack. I just never had the chance to actually see a performance. During that time, for personal reasons, it became a very important story to me. Now I've finally had the chance to watch this movie. Was it worth the 21 year wait?In a word, yes. This was absolutely everything that I'd hoped for in a movie version of the famed musical. Visually stunning, with such a memorable soundtrack and incredible performances, especially by Anne Hathaway who, goodness me, may well have sewn up an Oscar with her singing of ""I Dreamed a Dream"", something that put even the Susan Boyle version to shame.The story is by turns basic and complex. Hugh Jackman plays Jean Valjean, a man convicted and sentenced to five years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread. During that time, he tried to escape, but was caught, and ends up having fourteen years added to his sentence. Now after 19 years, he's released on a parole, but, as many released from prison discover even now, he can't find a job and can't find a place to live. He's taken in by a kindly bishop (Colm Wilkinson, who originated the Valjean role on stage), and then repays the bishop's kindness by stealing silver plates and the like. When he's caught, he claims the silver was a gift, and is astounded when the bishop not only backs him up, but offers him more. Valjean, who had been on the verge of turning into a villain, instead becomes a hero and sets out to return to being an honest man. Meantime, police inspector Javert (Russell Crowe, who really has an incredible singing voice), sets off in pursuit of Valjean, while around them France seethes with revolutionary fervor.That is, mind you, just scratching the surface. It doesn't touch on the romance, the comedy relief, the violence, the death, the other death, the many, many, many deaths. Some of these deaths are truly heart-wrenching, and I'm only half joking when I comment about hiding the razors before watching.The music is everything I'd expected and the sets are wonderful. But the real gem here are the performances. Jackman, Crowe, Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bohnam Carter are all exceptionally good in their roles, but it is Hathaway who walks off with the best performance on film. If you can sit through her final song and not want to start crying like a child, you might well need to have emotions.exe installed. In fact the only complaint I have about casting is that of Eddie Redmayne, a normally fine actor, but someone with a singing voice that sounds like what someone who wanted to parody a stage singing voice would sound like. It's not bad, really, but very stylized and odd.While I don't think this movie will or should win Best Picture at the Oscars, it still has a great deal to recommend it. I highly recommend it, the highlight soundtrack, currently available for fifteen bucks from Amazon, and even, if you feel brave enough, reading the original book. I don't think you'll be disappointed in any of the above.",5,"Hide the razor blades, it's time for some Les Mis!",1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,3118,"['first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'musical', 'version', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'something', 'surprise', '21', 'years', 'ago', 'listened', 'full', 'soundtrack', 'just', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'actually', 'see', 'performance', 'time', 'personal', 'reasons', 'became', 'very', 'important', 'story', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'movie', 'Was', '21', 'year', 'wait', 'word', 'yes', 'was', 'absolutely', 'everything', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'movie', 'version', 'famed', 'musical', 'Visually', 'stunning', 'memorable', 'soundtrack', 'incredible', 'performances', 'especially', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'goodness', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'sewn', 'up', 'Oscar', 'singing', 'Dreamed', 'Dream', 'something', 'put', 'even', 'Susan', 'Boyle', 'version', 'shame.The', 'story', 'turns', 'basic', 'complex', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'man', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'five', 'years', 'prison', 'stealing', 'loaf', 'bread', 'time', 'tried', 'escape', 'was', 'caught', 'up', 'having', 'fourteen', 'years', 'added', 'sentence', 'Now', '19', 'years', 'released', 'parole', 'many', 'released', 'prison', 'discover', 'even', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'place', 'live', 'taken', 'kindly', 'bishop', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'originated', 'Valjean', 'role', 'stage', 'then', 'bishop', 'kindness', 'stealing', 'silver', 'plates', 'like', 'When', 'caught', 'silver', 'was', 'gift', 'astounded', 'when', 'bishop', 'not', 'only', 'up', 'more', 'Valjean', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'verge', 'turning', 'villain', 'instead', 'hero', 'out', 'return', 'being', 'honest', 'man', 'Meantime', 'police', 'inspector', 'Javert', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'really', 'incredible', 'singing', 'voice', 'off', 'pursuit', 'Valjean', 'France', 'seethes', 'revolutionary', 'fervor.That', 'mind', 'just', 'scratching', 'surface', ""n't"", 'touch', 'romance', 'comedy', 'relief', 'violence', 'death', 'other', 'death', 'many', 'many', 'many', 'deaths', 'deaths', 'are', 'truly', 'heart-wrenching', ""'m"", 'only', 'half', 'joking', 'when', 'comment', 'hiding', 'razors', 'watching.The', 'music', 'everything', ""'d"", 'expected', 'sets', 'are', 'wonderful', 'real', 'gem', 'here', 'are', 'performances', 'Jackman', 'Crowe', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Helena', 'Bohnam', 'Carter', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'roles', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'walks', 'off', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'can', 'sit', 'final', 'song', 'not', 'want', 'start', 'crying', 'child', 'might', 'well', 'need', 'have', 'emotions.exe', 'installed', 'fact', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'casting', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'normally', 'fine', 'actor', 'someone', 'singing', 'voice', 'what', 'someone', 'who', 'wanted', 'parody', 'stage', 'singing', 'voice', 'would', 'sound', 'not', 'bad', 'really', 'very', 'stylized', 'odd.While', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'should', 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscars', 'still', 'great', 'deal', 'recommend', 'highly', 'recommend', 'highlight', 'soundtrack', 'currently', 'available', 'fifteen', 'bucks', 'Amazon', 'even', 'feel', 'brave', 'enough', 'reading', 'original', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'above']",N/A

So I went in, literally, with an open mind & a 'blank slate'. _ I tried my very, very hardest, to like this film/opera; but it is just horrible.Instead of selecting the best Voices, they selected the highest profile names they could cast, so long as they could sing well, to good... And the results speak for themselves. _ I loved ""Phantom of the Opera""; and I even liked ""Sweeney Todd"" (as well as one, most viewing this film have likely never seen: ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"", which I also loved). _ H.B.Carter is the only thing that kept me from Loving ""Todd"" (vs. Liking it); and sadly, she's in this one as well, which drags to an unbearable degree at times.  (and I'm not even going to touch the story/script-problems, as that's a whole other icky ball of wax... and even if it's 'faithful' to the original story... there are still some pretty huge issues which weren't addressed, which desperately needed to be, to make the story more palatable to anyone older than 10, or with an IQ over 70).Even the actual songs were bad, unmemorable, etc., which means it completely fails as an Opera/Musical -- but since it was the only ""Musical"" of the year (barring perhaps, ""step up 3"" or other tween-drivel), it was nominated for several awards, even though it's horrid.  So, literally, ""nominated by default"", and yet they proudly proclaim everywhere they possibly can: ""Nominated for .... Awards"", LOL.Excluding the very first scene (slavery/ship scene), the Direction/Cinematography is almost completely non-existent, with the camera being constantly stationary during most songs... i.e., It's in a fixed position, and the Actor(s) stay on their mark, in close-up or semi-close-up, and sing, sometimes even looking straight into the camera (which is done purposefully)... even though it does nothing to add or enhance the scene/mood/etc.  If someone were to time the ""stationary"" shots, I bet it would amount to nearly 1/3rd of the film's run-time; and so you're constantly having to deal with the boring ""shots"" in conjunction with the boring songs... Not a good combination.  (watch ""Phantom of the Opera"" to see the proper way to Direct & Shoot a Film-Opera! -- Or watch Phantom if you want amazing singers, good songs, AND good acting, all at the same time... rather than, a sprinkle here, a sprinkle there, as it is in this ""film"".)I expected much, much more.Hugh Jackman & the YOUNG Cossette are the highlights, w/ little else to praise.Hathaway isn't in this movie long enough to be, genuinely, considered ""best supporting"" anything... but I guess the Awards people felt sorry for her since she let them 'shave' her head on screen.  (or because it was so ""brave"" of her to do it, LOL, as if it hasn't been done dozens of times before)If Hollyweird has ANY sense left, they'll put the Director (and the Cinematographer, if there even was one), on a ""do not hire as"" list... because they clearly are not capable of delivering anything of value... let alone, LASTING value.

Valjean endures unbelievable hardship as a shackled prisoner as he sees his youth wasting away. When he is finally released from prison, he finds a prison in his freedom as public pariah who is never truly free as his activities are to be monitored and there is no way to improve his lot in life. He disappears and reinvents himself and through a series of circumstances becomes a wealthy man. While he enjoys his new life and tries to share his improved circumstances with others, he always feels the shadow of his former guard a public official type named Joubert. The ensuing story covers Valjean's attempts to evade Joubert who is seemingly always just one step away from capturing him and returning him to prison. As side stories, there is the romance of  Valjean's adopted daughter Cosette and the well born Marius, the French Revolution, and the ill-fated mother of Cosette named Fantine.This movie was remarkable in a lot of ways. Musicals are normally not very popular as an art form when translated to film. I really don't have a good explanation for why there aren't more musicals made, but i suspect it has a lot to do with cost. In the case of this film, it was very expensively made. The sets were really exquisite and while there was a lot of computer wizardry present the effects were generally very realistic in appearance. The costuming was fantastic and varied from the lush gowns worn by women to the rags worn by Valjean and his fellow prisoners.The story in itself was powerful and the music complimented the story as unfolded. The dialogue was sung as it was interspersed with large and small scale musical numbers which advanced the story along. The characters were well developed and I found myself becoming invested in their story almost immediately. The acting was really good and I found it interesting how the actors were able to use the music to enhance their roles. Even though i knew the story and where it was heading, I didn't find it boring or for that matter even paticularly predictable. I just sort of invested myself in this spectacle of sight and sound.I bought the DVD not so much because I plan to watch it a lot, but because I just found this to be a really exceptional film that I will enjoy in the future.",5,"For Me, A Threepeat",1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,2747,"['saw', 'movies', 'twice', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'obviously', 'was', 'impressed', 'what', 'i', 'saw', 'heard.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'novel', 'story', 'based', 'seen', 'couple', 'non-musical', 'film', 'versions', 'have', 'seen', 'musical', 'staged', 'twice', 'i', 'expected', 'enjoy', 'film', 'was', 'genuinely', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'i', 'really', 'loved', 'film.To', 'summarize', 'quickly', 'film', 'story', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'who', 'sent', 'prison', 'stealing', 'loaf', 'bread', 'feed', 'sister', 'son', 'Valjean', 'endures', 'unbelievable', 'hardship', 'shackled', 'prisoner', 'youth', 'wasting', 'away', 'When', 'finally', 'released', 'prison', 'prison', 'freedom', 'public', 'pariah', 'who', 'never', 'truly', 'free', 'activities', 'are', 'be', 'monitored', 'way', 'improve', 'lot', 'life', 'series', 'circumstances', 'wealthy', 'man', 'new', 'life', 'tries', 'share', 'improved', 'circumstances', 'others', 'always', 'shadow', 'former', 'guard', 'public', 'official', 'type', 'named', 'Joubert', 'ensuing', 'story', 'Valjean', 'attempts', 'evade', 'Joubert', 'who', 'seemingly', 'always', 'just', 'one', 'step', 'away', 'capturing', 'returning', 'prison', 'side', 'stories', 'romance', 'Valjean', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Cosette', 'well', 'born', 'Marius', 'French', 'Revolution', 'ill-fated', 'mother', 'Cosette', 'named', 'Fantine.This', 'movie', 'was', 'remarkable', 'lot', 'ways', 'Musicals', 'are', 'normally', 'not', 'very', 'popular', 'art', 'form', 'when', 'translated', 'film', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'explanation', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'more', 'musicals', 'made', 'i', 'suspect', 'lot', 'do', 'cost', 'case', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'expensively', 'made', 'sets', 'were', 'really', 'exquisite', 'was', 'lot', 'computer', 'present', 'effects', 'were', 'generally', 'very', 'realistic', 'appearance', 'costuming', 'was', 'fantastic', 'varied', 'lush', 'gowns', 'worn', 'women', 'rags', 'worn', 'Valjean', 'fellow', 'prisoners.The', 'story', 'was', 'powerful', 'music', 'complimented', 'story', 'unfolded', 'dialogue', 'was', 'sung', 'was', 'interspersed', 'large', 'small', 'scale', 'musical', 'numbers', 'advanced', 'story', 'along', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'developed', 'found', 'becoming', 'invested', 'story', 'almost', 'immediately', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'found', 'interesting', 'how', 'actors', 'were', 'able', 'use', 'music', 'enhance', 'roles', 'Even', 'i', 'knew', 'story', 'where', 'was', 'heading', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'boring', 'matter', 'even', 'paticularly', 'predictable', 'just', 'sort', 'invested', 'spectacle', 'sight', 'sound.I', 'bought', 'DVD', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'plan', 'watch', 'lot', 'just', 'found', 'be', 'really', 'exceptional', 'film', 'will', 'enjoy', 'future']",N/A

This adaptation of the smash Broadway show, itself sourced from Victor Hugo's classic novel of the post French Revolution and the suffering plight of the populace has been transformed into an impressive film which will appeal to those open to its free flowing style of song and music.  Think of this type of musical as operatic narrative with hardly a spoken line of actual dialogue.  For the uninitiated and fans of traditional movie musicals, this may take some getting used to. If one can embrace the format, it is a well made, emotionally moving tale of love and hope.Spanning the years 1815-1832, in Paris, France, the years following the French Revolution have left the country divided with its common citizens in poverty and hard labor.  A prisoner, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), is paroled under the watchful eye of policeman, Javert (Russell Crowe). Stigmatized by his record, Valjean flees his past and makes a new life for himself as an upstanding citizen until a chance encounter exposes his identity to Javert, and the hunt is on.  Meanwhile, in a related incident, a factory worker, Fantine (Anne Hathaway), has been unjustly fired and must struggle to survive and care for her young daughter, Cosette.  As Fantine must resort to desperate measures and all hope begins to fade, Valjean intercedes, and while Cosette grows into a woman (Amanda Seyfried), their lives intertwine with a movement to rekindle the Revolution as a growing revolt pits commoners against French soldiers even as Javert closes in on his quarry.Through these characters, we witness a wide range of behavior from treachery and betrayal to loyalty and unrequited love.  It's also about the secrets and the choices made especially by Valjean who comes to a series of crossroads in life. Jackman does a great job of conveying shame, guilt, desperation and anger, but those feelings give way to wanting to be a better man.  His Valjean is the conscience of the film.Hathaway owns her role as the doomed Fantine and has the chops to sing the signature song, ""I Dreamed a Dream"".  Her character's descent into hell is not unlike the doomed characters in The House of Mirth or Sister Carrie.  Crowe has the unsavory role of the obsessed Javert but proves an effective foil to Jackman.  The folks that made TV's The Fugitive must have modeled Inspector Gerard on Javert!The storyline has numerous supporting characters and subplots including one involving a pair of crooked innkeepers played with villainy by Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. (What's with these three name actors anyway?)  There is also a nice musical, montage sequence that alternates and merges several different settings and characters; it is directly reminiscent of the pre-rumble sequence in West Side Story.Production values are outstanding with the set designs realistically recreating 19th century Paris (with parallels to Dickens' London settings) befitted with costume designs of the period.  The camerawork relies heavily on handheld close-ups for realism.  Of note, this is one of the few musicals that did not loop the vocals in post-production. Rather, the actors actually sing on camera, and fortunately they all acquit themselves well with these terrific songs.  The effect is more akin to witnessing a live, stage production.The end is memorable as wishes and legacies are fulfilled.  When you figure the resources and talented cast directed by Tom Hooper (the King's Speech) that brought this to the screen, it is a remarkable achievement. Because of the theatrical source material, however, just be wary of the way it's all presented, narrative and all.

That being said, it wasn't a bad movie, and a lot of the singing from the principal stars was quite decent. It seemed pretty obvious that the cast was filled out with people with a musical theatre background as the unknowns were a notch above with their ability. Enjolras was extremely enjoyable as the leader of the revolutionaries. Hugh Jackman was nearly consistently good with his singing. Amanda Seyfried was ok, though I got the feeling sometimes she was channeling one of the Chipettes, Brittany perhaps? I saw Mamma Mia after this and was surprised that her singing there was so much better. The commentary, aside from the obligatory cast on cast sycophantic fluff mentioned Russel Crowe's background in musical theatre, which means that he doesn't deserve as delicate a review. Young Gavroche was a scene stealer, hopefully he has a prosperous career in the years ahead. The remaining members were passable, and since Les Mis has some of my favorite songs, as well as some that have wiggled their way into the public's collective consciousness it's sad to not walk away from seeing this with a new favorite version ringing in my ears.

With a cast including Hugh Jackman, Russel Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, and Samantha Barks, I felt this project couldn't go wrong (with the exception of Amanda Seyfried, which I contend that she is always the worst part of any movie she's in).  Add Tom Hooper (director of The King's Speech, which I ADORED) and we are setup for Oscar territory.  Even more interesting was the innovative 'live singing' that they did--basically they sang live on set, instead of prerecording the tracks as all others filmed musical have done.THE GOODAnne Hathaway is the best part of this movie.  Every scene she was in had me in tears.  It will be a travesty if she doesn't win Best Supporting Actress for her performance.  Hugh Jackman gave the best performance of his life.  And of course Samantha Barks' Eponine was brilliant.The effects and many of the shots were quite brilliant.  The coloring, the costumes, and the lenses were all amazing.THE BADRegarding the cinematography: I could have done with more variety of camera shots and angles.  The camera focused almost exclusively on a close-up of the current singer's face.  It was very distracting to me and not effective.Russel Crowe is one of the great actors of our time, but Javere just might be one of his worst performances ever.  He CANNOT sing!  Whoever thought it was a good idea to cast him should be run out of Hollywood.Amanda Seyfried was less atrocious than I expected, but she had dramatically less screen time than I had anticipated.  It seems they got the memo that she is an awful actress during the editing process.  Her singing voice and its goat-like vibrato is almost unbearable to my ears.In the end, the 'live singing' was also a distraction for me.  It didn't feel like a musical to me, but like an entirely new genre.  Each individual performance was powerful (with the exception of Russel Crowe's and Amanda Seyfried's), however when they are strung together it just felt weird to me.  It didn't have the energy or breathing room that a musical normally does.  I felt the brakes being slammed between almost every number.  I also felt that it was too emotionally manipulative: I felt like there a figurative plunger behind the screen, trying to get as many tears as possible.CONCLUSIONI seem to be the only one of my acquaintances that didn't love this film.  As a result I recommend it to all except those who are critically-minded.  Also, it is NOT family-friendly.  Lots of sexual content, most of it unneeded.

Les Miserable offers the complete view of a time in Europe, specifically France, when individual freedom and justice came to be the shield against inept and corrupt government.The protagonist, Jean Valjean's escape from prison symbolizes how those so unjustly accused and imprisoned can regain their lives even against the constant pursuit of a obsessed constable and the laws designed to further create injustices continued.  The law, symbolic by the pursuer of this former convict comes to terms of how low the inept and relentless laws continue to do greater harm than good.This film outdoes the many former interpretations of this great story.  The music, the live voice track and the performances of all involved brings Hugo and his imagination full circle.

1000060,A3QU74B9N0830G,B000GAKLZI,Dan Thompson,"[8, 10]","The anticipation and buzz surrounding this adaptation of the beloved book and musical has been extremely high since the first trailer came out and we heard Anne Hathaway's beautiful and haunting voice for the first time. Since then, it's been on many critics lists as an Oscar favorite. While moving and emotional, for me, the movie fell a little flat.First of all, there's no denying the talent attached to this film. Tom Hooper, following up his critically acclaimed and brilliant film The King's Speech gives the film great direction and captures the look and feel of 19th-century France. Likewise, the cast is on the top of their game here; Jackman is great as Jean Valjean and utilizes his previous Broadway experience here very well. I was also impressed with Seyfried, as I didn't know she had such a lovely singing voice, as well as newcomer Samantha Barks, who is sure to benefit greatly from her breakout role here. The true standout however, at least for me, was Hathaway. Her performance of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is truly moving and was my favorite song from the film. Though she isn't in the movie as much as I would have liked, I think her supporting role is more than deserving of an Oscar nomination. The one actor whom I felt was out of place was Russell Crowe. While he has a decent singing voice, it didn't blend with that of the other actors. I don't know if it was lack of stage performance or what but his performance just didn't do it for me.Perhaps the biggest caveat I have with the film is the length. I know this was adapted from one of the most critically acclaimed plays in history but with a running time of nearly three hours, it overstayed it's welcome. It may be that Hooper was scared to leave anything out for fear of upsetting the fan base, but surely there could have been some scenes that shouldn't have made the theatrical cut.Finally, there was a lot of buzz surrounding the fact that the actors sang their parts on camera instead of recording beforehand. Call me crazy but I actually prefer the prerecording method. Not to say it isn't impressive that this was done but there were a few lines I couldn't understand because the actor singing ran out of breath or was singing so softly. It may be nitpicking but there it is. I feel like touching up some of the songs could have added that much more to the film's power and majesty.",4,Moving and Emotional with a Few Caveats,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,2368,"['anticipation', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'adaptation', 'beloved', 'book', 'musical', 'been', 'extremely', 'high', 'first', 'trailer', 'came', 'out', 'heard', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'voice', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'been', 'many', 'critics', 'lists', 'Oscar', 'favorite', 'moving', 'emotional', 'movie', 'fell', 'little', 'flat.First', 'denying', 'talent', 'attached', 'film', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'following', 'up', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'brilliant', 'film', 'King', 'Speech', 'film', 'great', 'direction', 'look', 'feel', '19th-century', 'France', 'Likewise', 'cast', 'top', 'game', 'here', 'Jackman', 'great', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'utilizes', 'previous', 'Broadway', 'experience', 'here', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'Seyfried', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'such', 'lovely', 'singing', 'voice', 'as', 'well', 'newcomer', 'Samantha', 'Barks', 'who', 'sure', 'benefit', 'greatly', 'breakout', 'role', 'here', 'true', 'standout', 'however', 'least', 'was', 'Hathaway', 'performance', 'Dreamed', 'Dream', 'truly', 'moving', 'was', 'favorite', 'song', 'film', ""n't"", 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'think', 'supporting', 'role', 'more', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'one', 'actor', 'whom', 'felt', 'was', 'place', 'was', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'decent', 'singing', 'voice', 'did', ""n't"", 'blend', 'other', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'lack', 'stage', 'performance', 'what', 'performance', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'biggest', 'caveat', 'have', 'film', 'length', 'know', 'was', 'adapted', 'one', 'most', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'plays', 'history', 'running', 'time', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'overstayed', 'welcome', 'may', 'be', 'Hooper', 'was', 'scared', 'leave', 'anything', 'out', 'fear', 'upsetting', 'fan', 'base', 'surely', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'scenes', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'theatrical', 'cut.Finally', 'was', 'lot', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'fact', 'actors', 'sang', 'parts', 'camera', 'instead', 'recording', 'beforehand', 'Call', 'crazy', 'actually', 'prefer', 'prerecording', 'method', 'Not', 'say', ""n't"", 'impressive', 'was', 'done', 'were', 'few', 'lines', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'actor', 'singing', 'ran', 'breath', 'was', 'singing', 'so', 'softly', 'may', 'be', 'nitpicking', 'feel', 'touching', 'up', 'songs', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'power', 'majesty']",N/A
1000061,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B000GAKLZI,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[26, 33]","Les Miserables is very old fashioned entertainment. It's a series of crescendo moments with no build-up, no backstory, no pause. It's like eating just the topping of the pecan pie, and not bothering with the crust or filling. We were just ten minutes into the movie when I had to look at my watch and ask, okay, how long can they keep this up? Climax after climax, plot twist after plot twist, tearjerking scene after tearjerking scene. Oceans! Mountains! Punishment! Suffering! Religion! Redemption! Will there be a break for lunch? Will we be able to catch our breath?If you can watch this film without crying, I don't want to know you. The woman behind me was on the edge of her seat, not just because I smell good. The audience at the 10:40 a.m. matinee - the theater was packed - applauded at the end, and was very slow to leave the theater, even as the closing credits rolled.Typical of big, fat, nineteenth-century novels, there are numerous implausible coincidences that drive the plot. These coincidences took me out of the movie, but that was a good thing. The human suffering onscreen was overwhelming: suicide, enslavement, exploitation of living humans' body parts, prostitution, disease, spite, malice, child abuse, starvation, sadism, a dying man escaping through very graphic sewerage. I did have to repeat to myself, ""This is only a movie"" even as tears streamed down my cheeks.Jean Valjean is imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving children. He slaves for twenty years. He hauls a massive, capsized sailing ship. The scene does look like obviously fake CGI, but that doesn't make it any less gut wrenching. The workers sing, ""You'll always be a slave. You are standing in your grave."" They are the men we see in Sebastiao Salgado photographs of Third World laborers. They are Ilya Repin's ""Barge Haulers on the Volga."" Valjean's nemesis is the crazily obsessive policeman, Javert. They spar throughout the film, as Valjean's fate rises and falls and rises and falls and rises ... you get the idea.A story this big, this broad, and this implausible requires one hundred percent commitment from the performers. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is superb. He believes. He emotes. He is as big as the story itself. Jackman is the heart and soul of ""Les Miserables."" I loved him. Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen - they all had me convinced. Russell Crowe was a surprising disappointment. He's a brilliant actor and I kept waiting for him to bring some fire, some ice, some power, some insight to Javert, the obsessive and punitive policeman who mercilessly hounds Jean Valjean. I wanted a memorable moment that would make me feel that Crowe's performance brought Javert to intimate life for me. That moment did not arrive.I wondered while watching this movie whether it will be embraced by the political left or the political right. It is a deeply and unashamedly Christian film. A Catholic priest, emulating Jesus, is the catalyst. Valjean spends the rest of the film working to live up to the priest's Biblical example. ""Les Miserable"" is leftist in that it depicts the poor rising up, but then the poor fail their own putative saviors, and allow them to be massacred, alone. Javert, representing law and order, is a monster. The film's brief glimpse of heaven is like some limousine liberal's fantasy.I think ""Les Miserables"" is as popular as it is for the same reason that Cinderella is so popular. When ""Les Miserable"" was a stage play, tickets were a very expensive and difficult to acquire luxury. It is ironic that a play about the wretched of the earth would be such a luxury entertainment. Why do we enjoy watching people much poorer and more desperate than we will ever be? Why do we pay for the privilege? Because we all see ourselves in Cinderella, in Jean Valjean, no matter how lucky we are. I'll certainly never stand in cold sea water with iron shackles around my wrists and neck, overseen by a cold sadist like Javert. But, along with millions of others, I saw my own struggles in Valjean, and thanked God that I didn't have it as bad as he.

1000062,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B000GAKLZI,DarthRad,"[12, 15]","Both times that I have seen ""Les Miserables"" on stage, in 1990 in Boston, and then years later as a school play at my daughter's high school, several things have always perplexed me about the play - while the songs are beautiful, and the themes of poverty, crime, justice, struggle, love, hope, sacrifice, and redemption are gut-wrenchingly timeless, the play itself was always for me hard to understand.Singing every single line of dialogue in the play can be utterly confusing, especially when four or more people are singing/saying different things at the same time on stage.  And please don't laugh, it was not until the Internet matured and I was able to look up the story of the play that I finally understood the ending of the play.  Why are all those people who had died earlier gathered around and singing at the barricades again?  Because, you see, I had actually read ""Les Miserables"", the book, years earlier, and that was soooo not in the book.Tom Hooper could have made this movie any number of ways, and his directorial choices are outstanding.  As such, he should have been nominated for the Oscars for directing.The best choice of course, was the one to have the actors sing live during filming, rather than lip synching and recording separately.  The result is better than what could have been achieved with live singing onstage in a play - the singing in a theater play is still constrained in that the songs have to be sung with enough volume for the entire theater, which eliminates the ability to do the emotional soft whispers that add so much to songs such as ""I Dreamed a Dream"" or ""Valjean's Soliloquy"".Another great choice was to pick great actors for the main parts.  A lot of people nitpick about the singing voices of Russell Crowe or others in this movie, but first and foremost, for this movie to work, it was necessary that great actors who fit their roles be picked for their parts; thus a commanding figure such as Crowe needed to be present to balance the star power of Hugh Jackman in their opposing roles as Javert and Valjean.  I thought the choices for all of the actors were terrific.  Considering that die-hard Les Miz fans cannot agree on who they think is the best ever singing performance for the various audio CD editions of ""Les Miserables"", it is easy to discount such critics of the singing voices here in this movie as nit-pickers who have lost sight of the overall needs of this movie.  Ann Hathaway and Hugh Jackman are simply outstanding, and Daniel Huttlestone (Gavroche) and Aaron Tveit (Enjolras) nearly steal the show with their performances.  Isabelle Allen is adorable as the young waif Cosette, Amanda Seyfried is gorgeous as adult Cosette, and Samantha Barks makes for a fine adult Eponine.Finally, the best directorial choice was the combination of large, sweeping visuals together with tight closeups for solos, and sequential cutaways during the multiple-voice singing parts.  These technical choices take full advantage of the power of film over that of the stage - the ability to show the large and grande scenes of history while also bringing in up close and personal the emotions of the characters, and to tease out the complex singing parts into their individual voices.  It elevates the ""Les Miserables"" musical franchise into a far grander and more accessible, personal, and emotional experience than the stage version ever could.",5,"Wonderfully close and accessible, a walloping emotional punch, a tour de force of acting and singing",1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,3401,"['times', 'have', 'seen', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'stage', '1990', 'Boston', 'then', 'years', 'later', 'school', 'play', 'daughter', 'high', 'school', 'several', 'things', 'have', 'always', 'perplexed', 'play', 'songs', 'are', 'beautiful', 'themes', 'poverty', 'crime', 'justice', 'struggle', 'love', 'hope', 'sacrifice', 'redemption', 'are', 'gut-wrenchingly', 'timeless', 'play', 'was', 'always', 'hard', 'understand.Singing', 'single', 'line', 'dialogue', 'play', 'can', 'be', 'utterly', 'confusing', 'especially', 'when', 'four', 'more', 'people', 'are', 'singing/saying', 'different', 'things', 'same', 'time', 'stage', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'was', 'not', 'Internet', 'matured', 'was', 'able', 'look', 'up', 'story', 'play', 'finally', 'understood', 'ending', 'play', 'Why', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'died', 'earlier', 'gathered', 'singing', 'barricades', 'again', 'see', 'had', 'actually', 'read', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'book', 'years', 'earlier', 'was', 'soooo', 'not', 'book.Tom', 'Hooper', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'number', 'ways', 'directorial', 'choices', 'are', 'outstanding', 'such', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'directing.The', 'best', 'choice', 'course', 'was', 'one', 'have', 'actors', 'sing', 'live', 'filming', 'rather', 'lip', 'synching', 'recording', 'separately', 'result', 'better', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'achieved', 'live', 'singing', 'onstage', 'play', 'singing', 'theater', 'play', 'still', 'constrained', 'songs', 'have', 'be', 'sung', 'enough', 'volume', 'entire', 'theater', 'ability', 'do', 'emotional', 'soft', 'whispers', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'songs', 'such', 'Dreamed', 'Dream', 'Valjean', 'Soliloquy', '.Another', 'great', 'choice', 'was', 'pick', 'great', 'actors', 'main', 'parts', 'lot', 'people', 'nitpick', 'singing', 'voices', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'others', 'movie', 'first', 'foremost', 'movie', 'work', 'was', 'necessary', 'great', 'actors', 'who', 'fit', 'roles', 'be', 'picked', 'parts', 'thus', 'commanding', 'figure', 'such', 'Crowe', 'needed', 'be', 'present', 'balance', 'star', 'power', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'opposing', 'roles', 'Javert', 'Valjean', 'thought', 'choices', 'actors', 'were', 'terrific', 'Considering', 'die-hard', 'Les', 'Miz', 'fans', 'can', 'not', 'agree', 'who', 'think', 'best', 'ever', 'singing', 'performance', 'various', 'audio', 'CD', 'editions', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'easy', 'discount', 'such', 'critics', 'singing', 'voices', 'here', 'movie', 'nit-pickers', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'sight', 'overall', 'needs', 'movie', 'Ann', 'Hathaway', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'are', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'Daniel', 'Huttlestone', 'Gavroche', 'Aaron', 'Tveit', 'Enjolras', 'nearly', 'steal', 'show', 'performances', 'Isabelle', 'Allen', 'adorable', 'young', 'waif', 'Cosette', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'gorgeous', 'adult', 'Cosette', 'Samantha', 'Barks', 'fine', 'adult', 'Eponine.Finally', 'best', 'directorial', 'choice', 'was', 'combination', 'large', 'sweeping', 'visuals', 'together', 'tight', 'closeups', 'solos', 'sequential', 'cutaways', 'multiple-voice', 'singing', 'parts', 'technical', 'choices', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'power', 'film', 'stage', 'ability', 'show', 'large', 'grande', 'scenes', 'history', 'also', 'bringing', 'close', 'personal', 'emotions', 'characters', 'tease', 'out', 'complex', 'singing', 'parts', 'individual', 'voices', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'musical', 'franchise', 'far', 'grander', 'more', 'accessible', 'personal', 'emotional', 'experience', 'stage', 'version', 'ever', 'could']",N/A

It was a big mix of good and no so good all around - the acting, the characters, and the story. By the end I definitely felt the movie was too long.The first third of the movie was great. Despite having high expectations after hearing about Anne Hathaway's performance, her scenes still managed to exceed them. ""I Dreamed a Dream"" was by far the highlight of the film. Her performance is really gut-wrenching. The early scenes with Hugh Jackman were very good as well. Perhaps the most entertaining scene was with Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter at the inn.The middle of the film has its moments such as Samantha Barks playing &Eacute;ponine. However, this is also when I felt things go downhill. I didn't feel any connection to Cosette as an adult (Amanda Seyfried), so I never got overly concerned about her plight. Playing Marius, Eddie Redmayne seemed to have this dumbfounded look on his face most of the time. I didn't care for his character at all and the whole revolution felt more like grown-up kids acting out than anything noble to support. This isn't meant as a knock on the French Revolution, just the way it was portrayed here.When there were panoramic shots, the cinematography was breathtaking. Unfortunately, as many have noted, many of the film was shot with rather exaggerated close-ups. Yes, it's quite impressive that the cast were filmed doing the actually singing - but we don't need to see it up-close constantly as a reminder. I had heard negative things about Russell Crowe as Javert but felt his singing was good overall and had some really moving moments. All of the singing was good to great in fact.

1000068,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B000GAKLZI,David Bower,"[1, 1]","First of all I'll make it clear that I'm a fan of the music; I have both the 10th and 25th Anniversary Concert Performances and have watched them many times. I had the good fortune to see Les Miserables performed on stage and have always found the music to be very stirring.For days after watching either of the two concert performances I found the music haunted my thoughts and drew me back to the story.Like most other fans I was looking forward to the time when the movie version would be released so I ordered the disc and had it delivered the first day it was available. Visually the movie is powerful and rather overwhelming and takes the viewer on a high impact journey through the streets of Paris in the first half of the 19th century.There were some points where the journey was almost too gritty and became rather hard to watch. From a strictly musical perspective I found the movie to be less satisfying than either the 10th or the 25th Anniversary Concert Performances. It almost appears that the drama of the story was given more priority than the drama of the music.That is not to say there were no grand moments in the musical performance, there were, but too often the drama of the music was eclipsed by the drama of the scenery and action and that was a slight disappointment to me as I watched.I will not make direct comparisons between the musical performances in the movie versus the same performances in the two concert performances; I suspect everyone will have their favorites.If one is a true fan of the musical, I suppose it could be expected that they would have recordings of all three and could select which one to hear depending on their mood at the time. The movie makes a powerful and convincing addition to the collection and along with the two concert performances provides rich entertainment regardless of the mood of the moment.This one is a must have for any fan of the musical.

1000079,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B000GAKLZI,Deborah Earle,"[0, 1]","I'll be as generous as I can regarding this rushed effort. Compared to the more evenly and dramatically paced stage musical, I not only found the pacing to be hurried, but was a bit dismayed at how many stanzas were cut from its many iconic songs. I know there is some tradition of that being the case when musicals are transported from stage to screen, but here, it was a bit over done.Where Director Tom Hooper does receive points is in accurately capturing the griminess and dankness of the squalid areas of 19th century France.We do feel the grime and misery of the chain gang on a ship where we meet Victor Hugo's fabled protagonist Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman, who successfully captures his character's formidable strength) as he is given his parole after serving 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving nephew. The sentence was increased due to  Valjean's multiple attempts to escape.I would have chosen Will Theakston the actor who played the character, Marcus Flint in the ""Harry Potter"" films (or someone like him) to play the self-righteous police inspector, Javert, since  he more or less fits Hugo's description of that character. But Russell Crowe brings a firmness to the part. His experience in heading his own rock band serves him well here, despite much criticism. His rock tenor voice was suitable enough for the part. Javert hands Valjean his yellow parole pass. Valjean travels to the designated areas, but due to his pass can neither find shelter or work until he encounters the saintly Bishop of Digne (Colm Wilkinson, the musical's original Valjean, whose powerful vocalization initially sold this musical to all of us who have enjoyed it from its earliest years), who covers for Valjean when he steals the Bishop's  precious candle holders and is re-arrested by authorities. The Bishop gives him the holders and the candlesticks with the proviso that he become a better man, telling him he has purchased his soul for God.Although in violation of his parole, Valjean tears up his yellow parole pass and decides to begin life anew.Several years later, assuming the name Monsieur Madeline, he becomes the Mayor of Montreuil-Sur-Mer, and brings industry to the region, including a factory. The female workers endure sexual harassment  by the factory foreman(Michael Jibson, whose character, although not featured in Victor Hugo's novel, illustrates the plight of the working women of that time who had no rights, but endured unseemly treatment to be able to pay the bills), whose main target is the young Fantine.Having viewed this film in a theatre a week before Oscar Night, I felt that there would be no justice in Hollywood if Anne Hathaway did not win the Best Supporting Actress Award for her role as Valjean's ill-fated female counterpart, ousted from her job after being exposed as an unwed mother by malicious co-workers. Valjean was there, when that happened but failed to intervene. While in the past, I had hoped  that whoever directed the film version of this musical would cast someone with the fair-haired-blue-eyed looks with which Hugo ascribed his tragic heroine, since her coloring made her stand out among other French women and was the envy of her co-workers. But I appreciate the lengths to which Hathaway went to play her Oscar-winning role(which had once been played by her mother in a traveling stage production), starving herself to the point of emaciation, and receiving 2012's most-talked-about tonsure to reenact Fantine's sacrifices which pay for her daughter, Cosette's( Isabelle Allen, who would have more closely resembled her character if her naturally chestnut hair were not dyed blonde)lodging with an innkeeper, whom she fails to realize is extorting money from her. Fantine sells her teeth(in the book, her incisors), and finally begins to prostitute herself. Frances Ruffelle, The West End and Broadway's original Eponine, cameos as one of the ladies of the night. The scene of Fantine with her first client as the drugs she has taken to numb herself to his advances kick in is devastating.One can appreciate the symbolism in the difference in coloring between Fantine and her daughter in a way; a destitute mother embracing darkness so that her child may embrace light.Valjean still finds Javert in pursuit, as he has broken his parole, and an incident involving a man named Fauchelevant(Stephen Tate), who is rescued from being pinned beneath his cart by someone that the ever-vigilant Javert recognizes a former inmate with formidable strength. A man named Champmathieu(James Simmons) is arrested for Valjean's crime.In the meantime, Fantine is taunted by an idling dandy who pelts her with snow as she is working the street. Enraged, she attacks him. Javert shows up in time to apprehend her, and she pleads for mercy, as she has a child to support. Javert is unsympathetic, but Vajean, who saw the incident from the beginning, rescues the ailing, emaciated, and frightened young woman, and has her taken to the hospital, vowing to reunite her with her daughter upon learning of her wrongful dismissal from his factory.Valjean agonizes over the Champmathieu affair, but exonerates the wrongfully charged man. Then he visits the dying Fantine, reassuring her that he will find and raise her daughter. Javert shows up to arrest him and they duel before  Fantine's deathbed and the astonished nuns who had  nursed Fantine .Valjean escapes through a window and plunges into a river.The next scene is of the Thenardier's(an appropriately cast Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter)inn in the  village of Montfermeil. Amid the squalid splendor of Christmastide(which in the novel was nine months after Fantine's death), we meet the abused and forlorn Cosette, who has been enslaved by her guardians, wishing for a better life. The Thenardiers indulge their own daughter, Eponine( a dark little Natalya Angel Wallace, who bears a stronger resemblance to the Thenardier's other daughter, Azelma, who is excluded from the musical), filch their guests' possessions, raise prices for services unduly, and serve them a gruesome concoction of mystery meat.A frightened Cosette is sent to refill a bucket at a fountain in  the dark woods when Valjean encounters her and rescues her, informing her and the Thenardiers of her mother's death and that he is to take custody of her. The Thenardiers reluctantly relinquish her. But as Valjean and his little charge travel away, Javert is still in pursuit. Valjean makes a daring escape over a wall with Cosette in tow, and they arrive at a convent where Fauchelevant, the man rescued from his own fallen cart, works as a gardener. He helps Valjean secure a position there,and Cosette will be educated by the nuns. Javert remains determined to reincarcerate Valjean.By the 1830s, Paris simmers with political unrest. A cholera epidemic will soon claim the last Napoleanic general in the government, Maximillian Lamarque, the government's last champion of the poor. A group of idealistic college students who have formed an organization called Friends of the ABC(ABC being a play on the word ""abaisess"" or ""abased""), feel that an uprising is on the horizon.We see young Gavroche(revealed in the book to be the Thenardier's son, here played very precociously by Daniel Huttlestone), mixing among the various social classes and crudely pushing his way into an upper class carriage in the crowded Parisian streets.We learn that ABC member, Marius Pontmercy(Eddie Redmayne), is estranged from his royalist grandfather, Monsieur Gillenormand(Patrick Godfrey), due to differing political ideologies.In the decade since leaving the Thenardiers, Cosette(Amanda Seyfried) had grown into a beautiful young woman, very devoted to Valjean. Despite an unsettling  encounter by a gang led by the Thenardiers, Valjean and Cosette live quietly in the city. Both Marius, and Eponine( Samantha Barks) spot Cosette, and while Eponine wistfully admires Cosette's change of fortune in contrast to her own dead-end situation in the underworld, Marius is smitten by the young beauty.While recruiting Eponine to go scout out Cosette's wherabouts, Marius must face a dilemma about love and war.A pensive Cosette wonders about Marius. Unaware of her attraction to a young man, Valjean acknowledges her lonliness, and that she is changing, but declines discussion of her past.After leading Marius to Cosette, Eponine laments that Marius could never love her, while watching the infatuated pair draw closer, and wards of her father's attempt to rob Valjean's house with his gang shortly thereafter. Hearing noise outside, Valjean assumes it's Javert, and  decides to flee with a reluctant Cosette.The song ""One Day More""-highly reminiscent of ""West Side Story's""  reprise of ""Tonight"" , provides the segway between the beginning and end of the story, presenting a summation of all the characters' anticipations during the coming uprising.While performers voices were allowed more subtlety and nuances than they  would have been onstage, where a singer really has to belt out to sell a tune to a live audience, the live-recorded voices had just the right amounts of  emotion, strength, or weakness when necessary.The film accurately depicts how the student uprising began as Lemarque's funeral cortege proceeded through the streets. The group leader, Enjorlas(Aaron Tveit, who seems a bit lightweight compared to the stage's Michael Maguire) leads the demonstration of solidarity with the poor that results in a volley by the National Guard. A barricade is quickly formed by the rebels and their supporters. Soon, Marius deals with a tragedy there, and sends Gavroche to deliver a message for Cosette.Valjean intercepts the letter and realizes there is another man in Cosette's life besides himself. He heads towards the barricades to find him, and at one point Jackman does solemn justice to the iconic showstopper, ""Bring Him Home"".After a volley, Marius is wounded and Valjean, after releasing  the captured Javert, whom Garvroche exposed as a police spy, flees through the sewers with the unconscious Marius. The other rebels don't fare so well. While Javert remains adamant in his determination to capture Valjean, Crowe's interpretation of Javert  gives him a brief moment of humanity when he places his medal on the corpse of a fallen street urchin(perhaps a gesture recommended by someone with two young boys of his own). Valjean's refusal to retaliate against his long-time pursuer leaves a scarring impression on the policeman, which literally sends him over the edge.Peasant women clean up the blood from the cobblestone streets, Marius recovers and mourns his losses, and there will be familial reconciliation, and a joyous union before our story concludes. The Thenardier's comical exit-- a far cry from the fates they meet in the novel- is reminiscent of the exit made by Fagin and the Artful Dodger in the musical, ""Oliver!"", which also preceded a dramatic and emotion-laden conclusion.But we are happy to know that Cosette has been ushered into a better life, justifying her mother's sacrifice, and while the grime of the streets is never far from view, nor the mantle of suffering far from our grasp, the demand for a better world from the spirits of those fallen on the barricades will long stay in our memories.",4,Grimly

He was remarkable in ""Gladiator"". I think he's mis-cast it seems and fails to deliver anything of note. This is a film where it looks like he took the money can ran because he didn't even seem to show interest in his part.Way too many songs with too many missed notes all through this production. Why you wouldn't want good singers in an opera style film that is ""ALL"" singing........ is beyond belief to me.I think just listening to Ann Hathaway doing the one song, ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is so moving, it's worth the entire viewing of the film just for that alone.

For example when Javert is singing Stars,in the background you see Notre Dame cathedral. And also when Valjean first gets out on parole you see snowy mountains behind him. Really impressive. The performances in this movie were outstanding. Especially Ann Hathaway. Her voice is incrediable and she sang I dreamed a dream with so much passion and raw emotion that I had tears in my eyes. I was really moved. She really captured Fantine as a character on screen perfectly. Huge Jackman also did a very knock out performance. Though in my poersonnal opinion I think his voice could have been better. He definately can sing and act very well. I was even surprized by Russel Crowe's performance as well. I don't think his voice was bad. Though the other cast members had better voices then him his voice fits Javert. The music is just... unbelieveable. It is superb. Though I do prefer the broadway cast album of the show. (Colm Wilkensen's voice is gorgeous to listen to.) The music here is just as good even though I feel as if it loses some of the way the music is supposed to sound. But still very well done. I could go on  forever about how good this movie is. My only regret is that I did not get a chance to see the play live on broadway. Maybe a revival will happen. Anywho, if you have not seen this film go see it right away. You won't be disappointed.*update* Saw the play today (5/17/14) and it was WAY better than the film. Though this film adaptation had greater sets the music was clearer and more beatifull live.

It's true turning a  Broadway musical into a movie allows for some interpretation but this interpretation just fell flat.  First off they took one of the greatest musical compositions ever but didn't worry about matching voices to the rich vocal parts.  Val Jean has so many beautiful songs that Huge Grant just couldn't hit.  It seemed the film makers were more intent on &#34;acting&#34; then actual concern over the ability to preform this beautiful score.  Star power does not mean quality performance.While each of the actors have proven their abilities in their own right it was not for their expansive musical talent.  I don't want this to sound like a criticism on any of the actors.  As actors I have liked them all in their various works.  However, it baffles me how everyone raved about how talented they are based on this performance.... as a musical ensemble it was lacking.  Anne Hathaway sounded like she was panting through her songs rather than singing.  She was just awful. Hugh Jackman, even though I have seen other musicals he has been in and other vocal performances, just didn't have the ability to support the Val Jean richness and breadth.  And Russel Crow (I have to admit I don't know much about his musical ability) was, sub par, at best.The Inn keeper and his wife were boring as opposed to roustabouts and comical, I didn't feel any relationship between Marius and &Eacute;ponine,  And Enjolras did not inspire me in the slightest.Honestly, I feel I need to go watch the 50th anniversary (even with the little Jonas Brother) to get inspired about this great work again.

I know most of the lyrics by heart after listening to the London Cast CD hundreds of times. I thought I was prepared for what was to come. I had no idea.I turned off the lights, started the instant video, and my husband and I began watching. Within a minute we had left our home and were in France watching one of the most compelling scenes we have ever witnessed. There was no going back.We watched and cried, recouped our forces, then cried some more. It was painful yet cathartic, in a strange way, and I was totally unprepared.I can't ever remember being swept into a movie before where I felt like I was actually there witnessing the events. I was cold and damp, in the rain, and warm and dry by the fire. I smelled the sweat, fear, sewer, and blood.It was totally awesome and I was watching it on a fairly small TV by today's standards. I can't even imagine what it is like to see it in a theater.After watching Les Miz, and the other Academy winners, I feel that this film was robbed by the academy. If they could have seen it through my Le Miz-vigin eyes, I think they would have given it far more awards. As it is, I think the movie was just a rehash, to them, of a stage play they had watched into the ground.As I said, I know the music by heart but I've never heard it sung with so much passion.

It arrived the day before.I have to tell you, I was suspicious of the enterprise, but my wife was excited about it.So we retired to our theater last night. My wife reminded me it was not opera.From the very beginning this film is a truly excruciating experience and I was wishing it was an opera I was watching.Not one of the principals can hold a tune, or get on pitch let alone stay on it. Anne Hathaway can briefly get on pitch in the softer passages, but as soon as she tries to swell her voice she if off pitch by a mile.Even the chorus can not sing on pitch!The musical standard is well below any high school performance I have attended, or any production I have ever been involved with. The sort of sub amateur performance on this disc I tried to listen to last night would not have seen the light of day and this production should not have either.About a third of the way through, as I was holding my piece, my wife said, "" I just can't watch this any more.""I said ""every nerve I own is just raw"". So off it went never to disgrace this theater again.This is a pity. I like Les Miserable. I have seen it on Broadway.This movie requires singing actors, and not famous actors who can't sing. This is what opera signers are. They can sing and in terms of acting are the equal of any cast members here. We now have an abundance of fine singing actors.

However Tom Hooper's version of the West End and Broadway smash hit left me begging for more. The central performances are just fantastic: Hugh Jackman is both appealing yet determined as Valjean, while Russell Crowe is just a revelation as Javert. Never have I seen Crowe better cast; the role could have been made for him as the ever-vigilant officer of the law, determined to pursue Valjean at all costs, yet finding himself unable to carry out his stated mission of killing the ex-convict off.  Crowe also possesses an attractive singing voice that reaches its apotheosis in two solo numbers.Anne Hathaway has a comparatively small role as Fantine, but she is likewise wonderfully cast, with an expressive singing voice.  She not only has two solo numbers, but she has a memorable death-scene, as Valjean cradles her head and she imagines her daughter Cosette appearing in front of her.The production also contains two comic cameos by Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.  As she matures, Bonham Carter is becoming an accomplished character actor with a penchant for musicals (remember SWEENEY TODD); in this film she has a memorable number with Baron Cohen (who bears a startling resemblance to the late British satirist Peter Cook).For those who haven't seen the stage production, Hooper's film version tells the story crisply yet lucidly.  The orchestrations are just fantastic, while the ensemble cast (all of whom sung live on camera, rather than miming to playback) create great production numbers.  Add to that some memorable photography, and you have a film that is quite simply wonderful; the best musical I have seen for many a decade.",5,A Wonderful Rendition of a Classic Stage Musical,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,1735,"['Very', 'seldom', 'end', 'film', 'have', 'felt', 'standing', 'up', 'applauding', 'However', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'version', 'West', 'End', 'Broadway', 'smash', 'hit', 'left', 'begging', 'more', 'central', 'performances', 'are', 'just', 'fantastic', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'appealing', 'yet', 'determined', 'Valjean', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'just', 'revelation', 'Javert', 'Never', 'have', 'seen', 'Crowe', 'better', 'cast', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'ever-vigilant', 'officer', 'law', 'determined', 'pursue', 'Valjean', 'costs', 'yet', 'finding', 'unable', 'carry', 'out', 'stated', 'mission', 'killing', 'ex-convict', 'off', 'Crowe', 'also', 'attractive', 'singing', 'voice', 'apotheosis', 'two', 'solo', 'numbers.Anne', 'Hathaway', 'comparatively', 'small', 'role', 'Fantine', 'likewise', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'expressive', 'singing', 'voice', 'not', 'only', 'two', 'solo', 'numbers', 'memorable', 'death-scene', 'Valjean', 'head', 'daughter', 'Cosette', 'appearing', 'front', 'her.The', 'production', 'also', 'two', 'comic', 'cameos', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'becoming', 'accomplished', 'character', 'actor', 'penchant', 'musicals', 'remember', 'SWEENEY', 'TODD', 'film', 'memorable', 'number', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'who', 'startling', 'resemblance', 'late', 'British', 'satirist', 'Peter', 'Cook', '.For', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'stage', 'production', 'Hooper', 'film', 'version', 'story', 'crisply', 'yet', 'lucidly', 'orchestrations', 'are', 'just', 'fantastic', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'whom', 'sung', 'live', 'camera', 'rather', 'miming', 'playback', 'create', 'great', 'production', 'numbers', 'Add', 'memorable', 'photography', 'have', 'film', 'quite', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'best', 'musical', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'decade']",N/A

The Broadway show was, by far, my favorite show of all time (saw it twice).  I was in awe.  I also loved the movie, even though I disagree with some choices.  They made some unnecessary changes to some major songs that I disagreed with.  They left out parts of Fontines' death song, made some word changes to the finale (I would have liked Eponine to join Fontine and come floating down as angels) and made other changes.  I would have left the songs as they were.  I was also a bit disappointed in Russell Crowe's performance - both his acting and singing.  In addition, though I loved the sets and photography, I would have held the long shots longer in &#34;One Day More&#34; and the &#34;Finale&#34; and done fewer rapid face shots.  These differences aside, I loved all of the other performances and was amazed that these famous actors could sing so well and do it while acting at the same time - all done live, not dubbed.  The performances were spectacular and I agree with the Oscar to Anne Hathaway.  She was brilliant.  I loved Hugh Jackman, as well, and Elizabeth Barks was terrific as Eponine.  I was totally moved by this motion picture and started an ovation at the end of the movie, joined by the others in the theater.  Even with my picking at certain differences, this was my favorite movie of the year (close with Argo and The Life of Pi) and I give it 5 stars.

1000124,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B000GAKLZI,D. S. Thurlow,"[6, 8]","Victor Hugo's magnum opus ""Les Miserables"" has enjoyed a long life, first as a novel published in 1862, more recently as a musical, and now finally as a movie based on the musical.  Viewers be forewarned: if you like musicals, this movie is an excellent one; if you don't, it is a long movie with virtually every piece of dialogue done in song.The plot borrows from the novel.  The French thief and convict Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is paroled after a long sentence.  He has a life-changing experience after the kindness of a biship exposes him to the love of God.  Valjean will skip his parole and attempt to build a new life of good works.  In pursuit is the relentless police officer Javert (Russell Crowe), unshakeable in his sense of duty and in his conviction that Valjean can only ever be the thief he once was.  The two men will confront each other repeatedly over the years, as Valjean rescues Crossette,the orphaned child of the unfortunate prostitute Fantine (Anne Hathaway), raises the child (Amanda Seyfried as the adult Crossette) as his own, and later rescues her fiance Marius (Eddie Redmayne) after he is wounded in a revolution in Paris.  Along the way, Valjean will have also to suffer the mischief-making of the thief and con-man Thenardier and his wife (Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter).The movie is incredibly well cast.  Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway are outstanding, carrying long pieces of the narrative with good voice and acting.  Russell Crowe adds depth and almost sympathy to the role of Javert, although he is the least accomplished singer in the cast.  And who knew that Amanda Seyfriend was such a good singer?The production values are absolutely first rate.  Many of the scenes are on location in England and France, and even the studio scenes are not necessarily obvious.  The special effects are kept to a minimum, but they pack a punch.  Perhaps the only obvious challenge was in delivering some of the expository songs in camera closeup, where the effect is different that it might be on stage.  On the other hand, the closing scene would have been less effective any other way, and should rightly have the viewer in tears.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[504, 540]","The much anticipated movie adaptation of ""Les Mis&eacute;rables "" has arrived, and director Tom Hooper deserves praise for infusing Victor Hugo's iconic story of Jean Valjean with drama and profound emotion.  Hugh Jackman is superb as the former thief who is pursued relentlessly by his nemesis, Inspector Javert (a ruthless and bitter Russell Crowe), but Valjean focuses on redeeming himself by treating others with kindness.  Anne Hathaway is affecting as the desolate Fantine, forced into prostitution in order to support her child.  Valjean mercifully adopts Cosette, Fantine's daughter, after her mother's untimely death.Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen are deliciously over-the-top as the Th&eacute;nardiers, greedy innkeepers who steal from their customers and extort cash from Fantine for Cosette's upkeep while they keep the lonely girl in rags. Samantha Barks's show-stopping solo, ""On My Own,"" is thrilling.  Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried are appealing as Marius and the adult Cosette.  Finally, the wonderful Colm Wilkinson lights up the screen in his brief appearance as the Bishop.Why see this film if you have already taken in the Broadway show?  First, Hooper distills the essence of the plot without getting bogged down in extraneous exposition.  He elicits terrific performances from actors whose faces and voices are beautifully expressive.  Since much of the dialogue is sung, it is worth pointing out that the sound quality is excellent and the performers take pains to speak and sing distinctly (not a given in today's films).  Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg and Alain Boublil's score and Herbert Kretchmer's lyrics are often soaring, at other times tear-filled and poignant, and always unforgettable.The audience with whom we viewed ""Les Miserables"" was visibly moved by this tale of self-sacrifice, love, and salvation.  For an expensively mounted musical production, it is surprisingly intimate.  We grow to care about the characters and are transported from the darkened theater to the turbulence of nineteenth century France.

1000145,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B000GAKLZI,Enjolras,"[2, 4]","Les Miserables seems unsure if it's a musical or movie. I'm perfectly fine with musicals in the film medium.Mamma Mia! The Moviewas a great movie with quality singing, a well-paced story, and A-list actors who really delivered. However, even though I love Victor Hugo's novel and the Broadway musical, this film adaptation didn't work for me.The movie seems like it's a bunch of scenes strung together with Les Miserable music. I didn't get the sense that I was watching a movie with a coherent story. There are a lot of quick cuts from scene to scene that break up the storytelling a bit too much. Where in most musicals the camera tends to stay on a single scene or character, here it jumps around, breaking up the music.Another problem is the acting. With Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, and Anne Hathaway, this is an A-list cast. In fact, the producers seemed to go out of their way to get big names for this movie, even when they didn't fit. Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver an A-list performance. I never saw Valjean, Javert, or Fantine. Rather, I saw Crowe, Jackman, and Hathaway. They never really became their characters. That's one of the dangers of hiring celebrity actors for stories like Les Miserable with well established characters.Another problem is the singing. For a musical movie to work, the singing has to be good. If the movie had wanted to just tell the story in Victor Hugo's novel, it should have done so. But the director made a musical, which means the music is an important part. And again I think the A-list cast hurt the movie. I love the Les Miserable soundtrack, but I could never imagine listening to this movie's soundtrack. The actors mix emotional acting (e.g., loud sobbing) with the songs, which again suggests that it's not clear whether this movie wants to be a musical or traditional movie. I don't know if the movie should have avoided celebrity actors because Mamma Mia did it right, but maybe in this case that would have worked better.There is much to like about the movie. The sets and costumes are absolutely convincing. It looks like its set in early 19th century France. There are some nice creative choices, such as having the chain-gang at the beginning pull in a ship and dropping the French flag. So visually there's a lot that works. It just doesn't work for me as a musical movie.The movie also gets a LOT better after it reaches the 1832 part of the story. The revolutionary movement is portrayed really well. Great rendition of ""Do You Hear the People...""  Really stirring. But again there are some uneven choices, with the musical portion and then a brief fight scene without any music. There's still a lot of ""speaking-singing"" rather than pure singing.Overall, I'd give this 3.25 stars. It's certainly not horrible and most fans of Les Miserable will at least enjoy it, even if they won't love it.",3,musical or movie?,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,2856,"['Les', 'Miserables', 'unsure', 'musical', 'movie', ""'m"", 'perfectly', 'fine', 'musicals', 'film', 'medium.Mamma', 'Mia', 'Moviewas', 'great', 'movie', 'quality', 'singing', 'well-paced', 'story', 'A-list', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'delivered', 'However', 'even', 'love', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'novel', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'film', 'adaptation', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'me.The', 'movie', 'bunch', 'scenes', 'strung', 'together', 'Les', 'Miserable', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'coherent', 'story', 'are', 'lot', 'quick', 'cuts', 'scene', 'scene', 'break', 'up', 'storytelling', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Where', 'most', 'musicals', 'camera', 'stay', 'single', 'scene', 'character', 'here', 'around', 'breaking', 'up', 'music.Another', 'problem', 'acting', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'A-list', 'cast', 'fact', 'producers', 'seemed', 'go', 'way', 'get', 'big', 'names', 'movie', 'even', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'A-list', 'performance', 'never', 'saw', 'Valjean', 'Javert', 'Fantine', 'Rather', 'saw', 'Crowe', 'Jackman', 'Hathaway', 'never', 'really', 'became', 'characters', 'one', 'dangers', 'hiring', 'celebrity', 'actors', 'stories', 'Les', 'Miserable', 'well', 'established', 'characters.Another', 'problem', 'singing', 'musical', 'movie', 'work', 'singing', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'had', 'wanted', 'just', 'tell', 'story', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'novel', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'director', 'made', 'musical', 'music', 'important', 'part', 'again', 'think', 'A-list', 'cast', 'hurt', 'movie', 'love', 'Les', 'Miserable', 'soundtrack', 'could', 'never', 'imagine', 'listening', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'actors', 'mix', 'emotional', 'acting', 'e.g.', 'loud', 'sobbing', 'songs', 'again', 'not', 'clear', 'movie', 'be', 'musical', 'traditional', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'avoided', 'celebrity', 'actors', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'did', 'right', 'maybe', 'case', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'like', 'movie', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'set', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'France', 'are', 'nice', 'creative', 'choices', 'such', 'having', 'chain-gang', 'beginning', 'pull', 'ship', 'dropping', 'French', 'flag', 'So', 'visually', 'lot', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'musical', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'also', 'LOT', 'better', '1832', 'part', 'story', 'revolutionary', 'movement', 'portrayed', 'really', 'well', 'Great', 'rendition', 'Do', 'Hear', 'People', 'Really', 'stirring', 'again', 'are', 'uneven', 'choices', 'musical', 'portion', 'then', 'brief', 'fight', 'scene', 'music', 'still', 'lot', 'speaking-singing', 'rather', 'pure', 'singing.Overall', ""'d"", 'give', '3.25', 'stars', 'certainly', 'not', 'horrible', 'most', 'fans', 'Les', 'Miserable', 'will', 'least', 'enjoy', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'love']",N/A

After watching it again, I can definitely say that this is one of my favorite musicals.The story is very good. The plot follows a man named Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), who is being hunted for breaking parol by a man named Javert (Russell Crowe). Through a series of events, Valjean is converted and becomes a successful mayor. However, Javert is persistent, and as soon as he learns where he is, he once again pursues the former criminal. It's a moving story, with very good characters. Although, it does run a little long. It's not too bad. In fact, the film doesn't get that good until about an hour into it.The songs are very memorable. Now as I said earlier, you have to understand that this is an opera. In other words, around five sentences are actually spoken. Everything else is sung. It may seem odd at first, but when you get used to it, it becomes okay. Whenever the song is actually well written (in other words, when it's not singing dialogue), the songs are excellent. Some of my favorites include &#34;Do You Hear the People Sing?&#34; and &#34;One Day More.&#34; It's really neat to see all these big name actors show off their singing, even if some are sometimes a little shaky (*cough* Russell Crowe).Despite my original mixed reactions, I now really enjoy this movie. The story and characters are great, and the songs are excellent.

Awful!Hugh Jackman is barely acceptable as Jean Valjean.

Another guy who can barely sing.  The styling is non-existent.Amanda Seyfried as Cosette looks great...but continues this movie's quest to make the songs as unremarkable as possible.Samantha Barks as Eponime does okay and looks great.  But if you've seen Lea Salonga sing this role, then you know how much better the character can be.I could go on and on, but you get the point.  This is a very mediocre production of what should have been a great movie.

1000165,ACVJESFIQT8P8,B000GAKLZI,"gandalfcmk ""gandalfcmk""","[0, 2]","I hate to disagree with so many fine reviews of this film, but disagree I must. Unfortunately for me at least, LES MISERABLES is a cinematic experience that might have been but fundamentally isn't.I think the fault for much of this lies in two decisions Tom Hooper made very early on in the process. First was the decision to, for the most part, rely upon actors rather than singers. I'm sure a sense of what constitutes good ""box office"" was a factor here, but, in the end, I think Mr. Hooper (and whoever else) should have had a bit more faith in the essential product. Sung well, with singers who can act, the production might have been truly memorable, even a classic of sorts, the product is that good. The final result, sadly, is rather less than it might have been.To Mr. Hooper's credit, Russell Crowe, as Javert, looks inspired. On paper. And I must admit I looked forward to his performance with great anticipation. Alas, despite Mr. Crowe's best efforts, he is not a confident singer, and most of his concentration seems focused on the vocal demands of the role - which are considerable - leaving little left over for the actor's projection of character. As a result, Javert seems flat, almost wooden. Alongside the performances of a few others in the cast - those who are singers first and actors second - the contrasting mix-and-match is unfortunate, sometimes painful. I thought Mr. Crowe deserved better.Mr. Crowe (and others), I think, were also undone by Mr. Hooper's second decision: recording and filming live. This is not unheard of, of course - for a particular character (Rex Harrison's Henry Higgins comes to mind) or a song here and there, but not an entire score. For a professional cast, three hours on stage is demanding enough. On the other hand, rehearsals and ten-hour shooting days, complete with retakes, must have been sheer torture, particularly for voices not sufficiently trained for it or accustomed to it. I know: dubbing and lip syncing the entire film would have been an arduous task, a task that probably would have produced uneven results at best. All the more reason, I would think, to opt for a cast of professional singers.By comparison, the other issues with the film seem almost nit-picking. Without question, film is a different medium than the stage. Even so, it's probably not a good idea to try to inject emotion into the proceedings by an unrelenting and almost terminal dependence on the close-up, to the point where the film, in places, suffers from a severe case of claustrophobia, a feeling entirely absent from the stage production. Then too, stage actors are supported emotionally by performing with a live orchestra. Singing - or attempting to sing - accompanied by an earpiece is just not the same. The adrenaline is missing, and, too often, the actors seem to be suffering from abandonment. Given all this, it is a wonder the cast was able to perform as well as it did.I guess the final question might well be whether it is possible to make LES MISERABLES into a successful film at all. Not any easy question, but one would have to guess that this particular attempt must have given a good many people serious pause. Yet I do think that, given the early decisions that were made, the film we got was as good as it COULD have been. It certainly never suffered from a lack of commitment or effort, and Mr. Hooper can certainly NOT be cited for a lack of courage. For me, however, the more satisfying and emotional performances are presented in either of the Anniversary Editions, both of which were taped live and both of which are still currently available. I think they more fairly represent what LES MISERABLES was meant to be.This is not to say DON'T BUY THE DVD OF THE FILM. They are simply very different experiences.

1000166,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000GAKLZI,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 2]","It is worth noting that the French regard Victor Hugo as a poet and consider his novels, including the 1862 LES MISERABLES, minor works.  The novel became popular in America during the Civil War, when it was widely read by the Confederacy, who often refered to the book as ""Lee's Miserables.""  Thereafter, like many Victorian-era novels, it enjoyed cyclical popularity until 1980, when it was adapted into an operetta with lyrics by Alain Boublil and music by Claude-Michel Schonberg.  The original production played for three months in Paris.  It was subsequently further adapted by Herbert Kretzmer and James Fenton into the English language, and opened in London in 1985 and then in New York in 1987.  The London and New York versions were extremely popular at the box office and ran for years.  The original New York production alone ran for over six thousand performances.None of this has actually made critics like the show any better than they originally did, and it has been consistently described as manipulative, sentimental, and unoriginal.  The film version was an on-again, off-again affair, finally debuting in 2012.  Musicals generally have their musical numbers pre-recorded, and the cast lip-sychs during filming.  For LES MISERABLES, however, the singers performed live on set, and some publicity claims indicated this was the first time such had been done (not true; live on-set musical numbers go back at least as far to Doris Day in the 1957 THE PAJAMA GAME.)  Since most of the film cast were not trained singers, the result was somewhat hit or and miss, with Russell Crowe receiving significantly negative comments--but when it did work, it worked spectacularly, with Anne Hathaway giving a devastating performance and picking up an Oscar for her efforts.  But again, critics were not really any more enthusiastic about the film than they had been about the play.  Many noted that if you liked the play, you would probably like the film, but if you didn't like the play, nothing about the film would make you change your mind.  I didn't and it didn't.Although the movie is not noticeably like the book, it has much the same story, and a good many people have described it as ""the show where everybody sings about how poor they are and then most of them die.""  Although acid, this is actually a fairly straight forward comment, for the plot traces the troubles of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), imprisoned for almost twenty years on a trivial charge and, when he breaks parole, relentlessly persued by the French law in the form of Javert (Russell Crowe.)  Ill-starred lovers and angry revolutionaries round out the tale.  Curiously, the film relies a great deal on CGI, which tended to undercut my belief in the story, but my primary dismissal of LES MISERABLES rests on the fact that it is two and a half hours of overwrought emotion, with every single character playing at the same hysterical pitch.  It does not help that the music is incredibly, incredibly repetitive; virtually every song echoes every other song (I began to feel I was a trapped in an endless loop of ""At The End of the Day"" and ""Bring Him Home."")  Within thirty minutes I was exhausted and by the end of the film I was thoroughly over it.  Still, the occasional good performance (especially Hathaway) makes it worth the effort.  Depending on which version you get, the DVD comes with various bonuses, none of them particularly interesting.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Relentlessly Overwrought,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,3453,"['worth', 'noting', 'French', 'regard', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'poet', 'consider', 'novels', 'including', '1862', 'LES', 'MISERABLES', 'minor', 'works', 'novel', 'became', 'popular', 'America', 'Civil', 'War', 'when', 'was', 'widely', 'read', 'Confederacy', 'who', 'often', 'refered', 'book', 'Lee', 'Miserables', 'Thereafter', 'many', 'Victorian-era', 'novels', 'enjoyed', 'cyclical', 'popularity', '1980', 'when', 'was', 'adapted', 'operetta', 'lyrics', 'Alain', 'Boublil', 'music', 'Claude-Michel', 'Schonberg', 'original', 'production', 'played', 'three', 'months', 'Paris', 'was', 'subsequently', 'further', 'adapted', 'Herbert', 'Kretzmer', 'James', 'Fenton', 'English', 'language', 'opened', 'London', '1985', 'then', 'New', 'York', '1987', 'London', 'New', 'York', 'versions', 'were', 'extremely', 'popular', 'box', 'office', 'ran', 'years', 'original', 'New', 'York', 'production', 'alone', 'ran', 'six', 'thousand', 'performances.None', 'actually', 'made', 'critics', 'show', 'better', 'originally', 'did', 'been', 'consistently', 'described', 'manipulative', 'sentimental', 'unoriginal', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'affair', 'finally', 'debuting', '2012', 'Musicals', 'generally', 'have', 'musical', 'numbers', 'pre-recorded', 'cast', 'lip-sychs', 'filming', 'LES', 'MISERABLES', 'however', 'singers', 'performed', 'live', 'set', 'publicity', 'claims', 'indicated', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'such', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'not', 'true', 'live', 'on-set', 'musical', 'numbers', 'go', 'back', 'least', 'far', 'Doris', 'Day', '1957', 'THE', 'PAJAMA', 'GAME', 'most', 'film', 'cast', 'were', 'not', 'trained', 'singers', 'result', 'was', 'somewhat', 'hit', 'miss', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'receiving', 'significantly', 'negative', 'comments', 'when', 'did', 'work', 'worked', 'spectacularly', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'giving', 'devastating', 'performance', 'picking', 'up', 'Oscar', 'efforts', 'again', 'critics', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'more', 'enthusiastic', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'play', 'Many', 'noted', 'liked', 'play', 'would', 'probably', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'play', 'nothing', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'change', 'mind', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'not', 'noticeably', 'book', 'much', 'same', 'story', 'good', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'described', 'show', 'where', 'everybody', 'how', 'poor', 'are', 'then', 'most', 'die', 'acid', 'actually', 'fairly', 'straight', 'forward', 'comment', 'plot', 'troubles', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'imprisoned', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'trivial', 'charge', 'when', 'parole', 'relentlessly', 'persued', 'French', 'law', 'form', 'Javert', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Ill-starred', 'lovers', 'angry', 'revolutionaries', 'round', 'tale', 'Curiously', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'CGI', 'tended', 'undercut', 'belief', 'story', 'primary', 'dismissal', 'LES', 'MISERABLES', 'fact', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'overwrought', 'emotion', 'single', 'character', 'playing', 'same', 'hysterical', 'pitch', 'not', 'help', 'music', 'incredibly', 'incredibly', 'repetitive', 'virtually', 'song', 'echoes', 'other', 'song', 'began', 'feel', 'was', 'trapped', 'endless', 'loop', 'End', 'Day', 'Bring', 'Him', 'Home', 'Within', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'was', 'exhausted', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'Still', 'occasional', 'good', 'performance', 'especially', 'Hathaway', 'effort', 'Depending', 'version', 'get', 'DVD', 'various', 'bonuses', 'none', 'particularly', 'interesting.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

1000185,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000GAKLZI,Grady Harp,"[7, 7]","Les Mis&eacute;rables Is an experience. Director Tom Hooper has realized this timeless and often repeated Victor Hugo novel that was transformed into a near operatic setting by Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg, Alain Boublil and Herbert Kretzmer by opening up the story even more and utilizing genuinely creative musical enhancements. The result is an emotionally charged, breathtaking spectacle that while it is discussing the French Revolution and aftermath as a subject it remains a gently warm tale of love and commitment.The cast is extraordinary, down to the smallest role in the film. It is truly an Ensemble work and deserves recognition as such, but the individuals should also be honored individually.  Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is completely immersed in this multifaceted and very difficult role: it is the zenith of his career both as a film and as a stage actor/singer. Equally impressive (and a surprise to those of us who knew nothing of this early career in musical theater) is Russell Crowe's Javert - very deserving of Best Supporting Actor at Oscar time for his powerful embodiment of misguided and tortured head of police, but for some reason he is being overlooked. Anne Hathaway gives us a Fantine that will be the benchmark for all others who sing this role. Amanda Seyfried handles Cosette's difficult soprano lines with relative ease and feels completely right in her approach to the role. Another major shock is Eddie Redmayne as Marius: we all are aware of his acting sills, but this young man has a splendid voice and makes his character one of the standouts of the story. Samantha Barks as &Eacute;ponine is a star turn, combining screen presence with fine acting and a solid vocal ability.Each of the lads who spark the revolutionary barricade is outstanding; Aaron Tveit as Enjolras completely wins hearts with his handsome looks, his sensitive acting and his very fine voice and close behind him is performance quality are George Blagden, Killian Donnelly, Fra Fee, Gabriel Vick and for course Daniel Huttlestone as the young spunky Gavroche. Director Hooper has given us a different take on the Th&eacute;nardiers - no silly slapstick here, but instead a smarmy, oily evil couple whose behavior at other people's expense make us laugh: Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen make them unforgettable. And it is a true bow to theatrical history to cast Colm Wilkinson (who originated the role of Jean Valjean in 1980) as the Bishop.In all this is a stunning success, visually, vocally, acting, directing, costuming, and large ensemble wise.  It is unforgettable.  Highly Recommended.

1000196,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B000GAKLZI,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[23, 27]","AGAIN, the musical of a decade. This is the Les Mis cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me. It has revolutionary action; heart felt romance; faith-forgiveness-retribution; aesthetic musical. Hugh Jackman as John Valjean, convict 24601, looks the ferocious revolutionary facially; sings fiercefully, romantically, and beautifully; and deserves his Oscar nomination. As does this film. My vote has changed from Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" to ""Les Mis"" after one viewing. I WILL go back, I will buy the DVD.Les Mis is a musical, it's about music, arguably the best ever written for the stage. This film version of the 18th century French chronicle has raised the bar for film musicals. This well known story and theatre hit has been upgraded via film. It takes the best of what theatre has to offer and adds close-up, a mega cast, and music perfection that makes this film-musical ever more magical.Close-ups allow the stunning singers to add powerful facial emotion to the well-known Les Mis lyrics, right down to nasal hairs, warts, moles, freckles on a comrade, tears flowing into snot, and the sweat of love. Fantine (Oscar nominated Anne Hathaway) is stellar in song, but I'd give an Oscar to her daughter Cosette (Amanda Seyfried- `Mama Mia!') with her voice, body, face, and acting performance.I didn't know Russell Crowe [Javert] could sing, and do it well, too.The young lad on the barricade, Gavroch, was Daniel Huttlestone in his first film role, but surely not his last. He also played Gavroch in Queen's Theatre performances. What a voice.Costumes & sets are spectacles all their own. You almost smell the 1700s.Les Mis theme comes from one of it's songs, ""To love another person is to see the face of God.""But the film ended and I had to leave, c'est la vie.IT'S THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER GIVEN ROLLING CREDITS ON A SCREEN A STANDING OVATION.The film was as alive as the theatre stage.

I wasn't that familiar with the story going in, and fortunately it was very understandable on the big screen.  I instantly became enthralled.  The first scene with the prisoners dragging the massive ship was incredible.  Fantine was excellent, and she did have a significant role.  I felt she did have an adequate amount of screen time and her her scenes were packed with evocative acting.The singing was top notch, Eddie Redmayne in particular.  Some of the notes he hit were so high, pure and perfect.  Russell Crowe has gotten a bad rap for his singing, but I really thought it was fine given that he plays a character you're not supposed to like anyway.  Hugh Jackman was so handsome with his curly hair.  I didn't like the revolution part so much, but it was obviously part of the story and the second time I saw the movie it wasn't as long as it seemed on my first viewing.

The first half of the movie I would give four stars because there were a few scenes that I didn't completely like the way they were done, a few camera angles seem too close up, and a few other parts seemed rushed through, and maybe it's just me but I couldn't understand every word that was sung, and with 99 percent of it being sung when the 1 percent that's not sung it seems odd in hoping they would finally do some talking but they didn't. Although, it's understandable they wanted to pick up the pace to get to the rest of the story. There could have been a few more scenes to show the relationship between Valjean and Cosette. Isabelle Allen was very good as the young Cosette and she could have had a few more scenes as well. Samantha Barks as Eponine was amazing. Aaron Tveit as Enjolras was perfect in bringing the strong desire of the revolution to fight for freedom. Because Les Miserables 2012 was a musical it was phenomenal in expressing the strength of emotions of the revolution. This was similar to the Les Miserables Tenth Anniversary Concert dvd (with Ruthie Henshall, Lea Salonga, and others) that I give 10 Stars because the finale is epic. In Les Miserables 1998 Geoffrey Rush was excellent with ruthlessness, and Liam Neeson was great in showing mercy and being humble, but the 1998 version was not a musical.

1000219,A20TZ1MQ0KMJRR,B000GAKLZI,Jaha,"[0, 1]","The success of Les Miserables hinges on the chemistry and power of the two lead characters, Jean Valjean and Javier.  Miss that dynamic and the musical will spiral down a pit of unrecoverable failure.  This over hyped Hollywood blockbuster rendition broke the cardinal rule and ends up a flat, boring, directionless mess of a musical film.The obvious issue is Russell Crowe is abysmal in this performance.  It's not his fault.  He's a decent actor but should never have been in this role.  Javier needs to be an energetic, powerful man of convictions and hatred.  Not only could Crowe not sing up to the standards demanded of the role but he doesn't even act.  Most of his performances have him standing rigidly squeaking out his lines and not even coming close to anything of the stage variety.  Javier has probably the most powerful songs in the production yet Crowe couldn't take advantage of that.Then add in Jackman.  Jackman has stage experience but again this role doesn't seem quite right for him.  I blame direction for this.  Jackman has to move from spoken word to singing on several occasions and it just makes the whole experience seem awkward.  I felt Hugh could have sang better in this performance.  He is passable but I would rather have seen him in Javier's role as it would suit him better.  Perhaps the nail in the coffin for Jackman is his most pivotal scenes require him to go up against Russel Crowe.  Valjean needs to stand up to Javier and play off his power but the two are a close match.  Here in this production you can tell Jackman could easily overpower Crowe and so Hugh holds back.  It really makes for some awkward screen moments and wasted opportunity.That leads me to the biggest problem with this film.  It has no direction at all.  It feels as if the director just grabbed the biggest name actors he could get and just let them do whatever they wanted.  There is virtually no chemistry between any of the characters.  Its as if the scenes in the film are the first time the actors are actually working together.  This is all wrong.  All wrong entirely.  Carter and Cohen's roles of the crooked innkeepers are prime example.  Both of these actors are capable of crazy characters but they are completely flat here.  Carter was the biggest disappointment as I really thought she could bring something to that role.  When I read some reviews here about how marvelous they were I almost choked.  Cohen is a mess.  His lines are all out of sync and there is no chemistry between he and Carter which was a major shame.  The only duet that seems to have any chemistry is Marius and Cosette.  Beyond that all of the scenes just feel cold, broken, and bland.  Even the slam dunk bar scenes are a mess.  I just couldn't shake the constant feelings that these scenes were lackluster outtakes rather than finished product.  Real shame.The highlights of the film are decent cinematography although it is repetitive.  The score is virtually the same as the musical so little has changed there and the ensemble cast is as good as always.  The biggest irony is that out of all the star power in this film it is Samantha Barks (Eponine) that walks away with the best performance although Anne Hathaway did surprise me for how well she did considering what I expected from her.In the end I just think this movie had no direction.  It's truly the worst rendition of this masterpiece I have ever seen and I have seen this a lot on Broadway, off broadway, even high school productions were better than this.  The actors cast just were not up to par with the quality of what the roles demand and worse, the director is so poor he exposes their weakness even more by putting them in awkward scenes with broken cadences and strange spoken word segments.Les Mis is all about the chemistry of the roles.  Valjean v. Javier.  Eponine v. Cosette v. Marius.  The innkeeprs v. the world.  These dynamics are imperative to succeed with this production and the Director completely missed.  Better voices would have greatly improved this busted vision of a classic but I think a better director would have made significantly better choices even with poor acting.If you must rent this but skip it otherwise.  So many better productions of this story out there.  A big budget is not all it should take.  This isn't even a movie.  It's a collection of dress rehearsal lackluster outtakes roughly edited together to resemble something of video.",2,More Miserable,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,4443,"['success', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'chemistry', 'power', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'Javier', 'Miss', 'dynamic', 'musical', 'will', 'spiral', 'down', 'pit', 'unrecoverable', 'failure', 'hyped', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'rendition', 'broke', 'cardinal', 'rule', 'up', 'flat', 'boring', 'directionless', 'mess', 'musical', 'film.The', 'obvious', 'issue', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'abysmal', 'performance', 'not', 'fault', 'decent', 'actor', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'role', 'Javier', 'be', 'energetic', 'powerful', 'man', 'convictions', 'hatred', 'Not', 'only', 'could', 'Crowe', 'not', 'sing', 'up', 'standards', 'demanded', 'role', ""n't"", 'even', 'act', 'Most', 'performances', 'have', 'standing', 'rigidly', 'squeaking', 'out', 'lines', 'not', 'even', 'coming', 'close', 'anything', 'stage', 'variety', 'Javier', 'probably', 'most', 'powerful', 'songs', 'production', 'yet', 'Crowe', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'advantage', 'that.Then', 'add', 'Jackman', 'Jackman', 'stage', 'experience', 'again', 'role', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'right', 'blame', 'direction', 'Jackman', 'move', 'spoken', 'word', 'singing', 'several', 'occasions', 'just', 'whole', 'experience', 'seem', 'awkward', 'felt', 'Hugh', 'could', 'have', 'sang', 'better', 'performance', 'passable', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'Javier', 'role', 'would', 'suit', 'better', 'Perhaps', 'nail', 'coffin', 'Jackman', 'most', 'pivotal', 'scenes', 'require', 'go', 'up', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'Valjean', 'stand', 'up', 'Javier', 'play', 'off', 'power', 'two', 'are', 'close', 'match', 'Here', 'production', 'can', 'tell', 'Jackman', 'could', 'easily', 'overpower', 'Crowe', 'so', 'Hugh', 'back', 'really', 'awkward', 'screen', 'moments', 'wasted', 'opportunity.That', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'direction', 'director', 'just', 'grabbed', 'biggest', 'name', 'actors', 'could', 'get', 'just', 'let', 'do', 'wanted', 'virtually', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'first', 'time', 'actors', 'are', 'actually', 'working', 'together', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'entirely', 'Carter', 'Cohen', 'roles', 'crooked', 'innkeepers', 'are', 'prime', 'example', 'actors', 'are', 'capable', 'crazy', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'flat', 'here', 'Carter', 'was', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'really', 'thought', 'could', 'bring', 'something', 'role', 'When', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'how', 'marvelous', 'were', 'almost', 'choked', 'Cohen', 'mess', 'lines', 'are', 'sync', 'chemistry', 'Carter', 'was', 'major', 'shame', 'only', 'duet', 'have', 'chemistry', 'Marius', 'Cosette', 'Beyond', 'scenes', 'just', 'feel', 'cold', 'broken', 'bland', 'Even', 'slam', 'dunk', 'bar', 'scenes', 'are', 'mess', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'shake', 'constant', 'feelings', 'scenes', 'were', 'lackluster', 'outtakes', 'rather', 'finished', 'product', 'Real', 'shame.The', 'highlights', 'film', 'are', 'decent', 'cinematography', 'repetitive', 'score', 'virtually', 'same', 'musical', 'so', 'little', 'changed', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'as', 'good', 'always', 'biggest', 'irony', 'star', 'power', 'film', 'Samantha', 'Barks', 'Eponine', 'away', 'best', 'performance', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'did', 'surprise', 'how', 'well', 'did', 'considering', 'what', 'expected', 'her.In', 'end', 'just', 'think', 'movie', 'had', 'direction', 'truly', 'worst', 'rendition', 'masterpiece', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'Broadway', 'off', 'broadway', 'even', 'high', 'school', 'productions', 'were', 'better', 'actors', 'cast', 'just', 'were', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'quality', 'what', 'roles', 'demand', 'worse', 'director', 'so', 'poor', 'weakness', 'even', 'more', 'putting', 'awkward', 'scenes', 'broken', 'cadences', 'strange', 'spoken', 'word', 'segments.Les', 'Mis', 'chemistry', 'roles', 'Valjean', 'v.', 'Javier', 'Eponine', 'v.', 'Cosette', 'v.', 'Marius', 'innkeeprs', 'world', 'dynamics', 'are', 'imperative', 'succeed', 'production', 'Director', 'completely', 'missed', 'Better', 'voices', 'would', 'have', 'greatly', 'improved', 'busted', 'vision', 'classic', 'think', 'better', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'significantly', 'better', 'choices', 'even', 'poor', 'acting.If', 'must', 'rent', 'otherwise', 'So', 'many', 'better', 'productions', 'story', 'there', 'big', 'budget', 'not', 'should', 'take', ""n't"", 'even', 'movie', 'collection', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'lackluster', 'outtakes', 'roughly', 'edited', 'together', 'resemble', 'something', 'video']",N/A

I also know at least a dozen musical nerds who love the stage version but their opinions were even divided on the film. I saw it and really enjoyed the whole thing much to the shock of my nerd friends who had the following issues.If you're a staunch fan of the live musical, you're not going to be happy about the abridgements made in some of the most popular songs. Additionally, there are deviations from the stage version that are apparently more faithful to the original novel but potentially a little unnerving. If you're a 'light fan' you may not even notice these changes and may frankly thank them for keeping the length manageable.I was personally blown away by Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman in both their singing and performance - clearly stand out, Oscar-winning performances if ever they were any. Nerds were not convinced that these were the best Fantine and Valjean compared to the London and New York stage versions to which I shake my head in disbelief. Seriously, both actors give everything to their parts here and carry the 'emotional necessity' of the roles perfectly. Actually, a big thumbs up to the make up for both characters too - they look truly beaten down.I'd heard that Russell Crowe was a disaster and he was - partly because the other singers are in a different league. Since the entire film was performed live to camera (rather than recorded and lip-sync'd), he clearly struggles and there's no post production on the sound to hide it. But the big shocker is Amanda Seyfried who sings her little heart out in Mamma Mia but crashes and burns with a warbly, kind-of-operatic Cosette.On a technical note, although the sets were excellent, the connecting CGI was dreadful - watching the opening scene with 50 real people in real water tugging a large fake boat wasn't a great way to open. It's a shame since the rest of the scene was really great. Additionally, the camerawork is fairly sloppy throughout - the actors were allowed perform without hitting marks so occasionally the camera operators go out of their way to get them back in the frame and the focus puller is working overtime. Similarly, this causes problems with the lighting so some of the singing scenes are very dark as the camera catches up with the actor.Overall, it's a very good adaptation with a couple of flaws but nevertheless was better than most films in 2012. It's easily accessible to those who haven't seen it before all the way up the musical groupies who critique every line of dialog.",4,Deserving of the Oscar nominations,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,2605,"['must', 'have', 'seen', 'Les', 'Miz', 'live', '20', 'times', 'so', 'was', 'interested', 'catch', 'up', 'movie', 'given', 'hype', 'also', 'know', 'least', 'dozen', 'musical', 'nerds', 'who', 'love', 'stage', 'version', 'opinions', 'were', 'even', 'divided', 'film', 'saw', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'whole', 'thing', 'much', 'shock', 'nerd', 'friends', 'who', 'had', 'following', 'issues.If', ""'re"", 'staunch', 'fan', 'live', 'musical', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'happy', 'abridgements', 'made', 'most', 'popular', 'songs', 'Additionally', 'are', 'deviations', 'stage', 'version', 'are', 'apparently', 'more', 'faithful', 'original', 'novel', 'potentially', 'little', 'unnerving', ""'re"", ""'light"", 'fan', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'changes', 'may', 'frankly', 'thank', 'keeping', 'length', 'manageable.I', 'was', 'personally', 'blown', 'away', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'singing', 'performance', 'clearly', 'stand', 'out', 'Oscar-winning', 'performances', 'ever', 'were', 'Nerds', 'were', 'not', 'convinced', 'were', 'best', 'Fantine', 'Valjean', 'compared', 'London', 'New', 'York', 'stage', 'versions', 'shake', 'head', 'disbelief', 'Seriously', 'actors', 'give', 'everything', 'parts', 'here', 'carry', ""'emotional"", 'necessity', 'roles', 'perfectly', 'Actually', 'big', 'thumbs', 'up', 'make', 'up', 'characters', 'too', 'look', 'truly', 'beaten', 'down.I', ""'d"", 'heard', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'was', 'disaster', 'was', 'partly', 'other', 'singers', 'are', 'different', 'league', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'performed', 'live', 'camera', 'rather', 'recorded', 'lip-sync', ""'d"", 'clearly', 'post', 'production', 'sound', 'hide', 'big', 'shocker', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'who', 'little', 'heart', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'crashes', 'burns', 'warbly', 'kind-of-operatic', 'Cosette.On', 'technical', 'note', 'sets', 'were', 'excellent', 'connecting', 'CGI', 'was', 'dreadful', 'watching', 'opening', 'scene', '50', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'water', 'tugging', 'large', 'fake', 'boat', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'way', 'open', 'shame', 'rest', 'scene', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'Additionally', 'camerawork', 'fairly', 'sloppy', 'actors', 'were', 'allowed', 'perform', 'hitting', 'marks', 'so', 'occasionally', 'camera', 'operators', 'go', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'frame', 'focus', 'puller', 'working', 'overtime', 'Similarly', 'problems', 'lighting', 'so', 'singing', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'dark', 'camera', 'up', 'actor.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'couple', 'flaws', 'nevertheless', 'was', 'better', 'most', 'films', '2012', 'easily', 'accessible', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'way', 'musical', 'groupies', 'who', 'critique', 'line', 'dialog']",N/A

1000231,AAWXDUWEW5D0Q,B000GAKLZI,Jamie,"[3, 3]","The first time I saw the stage production of Les Miserables, I was blown away. I had never loved a musical before and I didn't expect this one to be any different. But it WAS different. Almost every line was sung making it almost more like an opera, which I had never been a huge fan of either, but something about Les Miserables grabbed me and wouldn't let go. I have been a huge fan of it ever since, right down to owning 2 different versions of the soundtrack, the London Cast recording AND the Broadway Cast recording, both of which have areas and performances that exceed the other (hence the reason for owning both).So I was very hesitantly excited about this movie version. It had some great actors attached, but could those actors sing? It was rumored to be faithful to the stage version, including the long running time, but how well would that transfer to film?After having finally seen it in it's last week in theaters, I can say with some relief that I very much enjoyed it, but I didn't quite love it as much as I hoped I would (although I suspect my admiration will increase slightly upon repeated viewings now that I've read some interviews and watched some ""making of"" videos). There were some things that held it back from greatness, but still managed to allow it to meet my expectations in certain areas and even exceed them in others.The stage production is really fundamentally about the singing. I mean, the sets and costumes are great, but not everyone is close enough to see the emotion through facial expressions so it has to be conveyed in the song. But a movie is full of close ups and expressions become very important, and a movie would get boring very quickly if the only expression on the actors face in every scene is ""eyes closed, mouth wide open"". So there has to be a little give and take in translating this to film.The acting is uniformly excellent, no complaints. The power and emotion of various scenes are easily conveyed by the strength and skill of the actors, but not always by the strength and conviction of their singing. Hugh Jackman is an excellent example of this. His performance is fantastic, he plays the role extremely well and is able to make you feel both his suffering and his joy by his ability as an actor, but his singing, while commendable, is far from overwhelming. The fact that the songs were recorded live during filming so the actors could set the tone of the scene, as opposed to being recorded in a sound booth and dubbed into the film later, adds to the power of the scene but detracts from the power of the song. Give and take.Anne Hathaway has received a lot of attention for her portrayal of Fantine, all of which is very much deserved. She truly earned each and every award she's won. But I also have to give special accolades to Eddie Redmayne for his performance of ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"", which is my absolute favorite song in Les Miserables, and in my opinion is the 2nd strongest performance after Anne's ""I Dreamed a Dream"".I've listened to the London and Broadway recordings dozens of times each, but I don't think the soundtrack to this movie will hold up as well without the added visuals since so much of the actual power behind the scenes lies in the actors ""physical"" performance and presence, although I will probably still buy it even if just for a few certain songs.Overall the review on Blu-ray.com sums up my feelings about the film almost perfectly. All those things I couldn't quite put my finger on are explained very well there, but in the end I also agree with the reviewer that this film largely succeeds in spite of these things and I have every intention of buying it and watching it over and over again because a few key scenes are absolutely amazing enough to justify it.",4,There's a give and take involved in translating this production to film...,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,3776,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'stage', 'production', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'had', 'never', 'loved', 'musical', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'one', 'be', 'different', 'WAS', 'different', 'line', 'was', 'sung', 'making', 'almost', 'more', 'opera', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'something', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'grabbed', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'ever', 'right', 'down', 'owning', '2', 'different', 'versions', 'soundtrack', 'London', 'Cast', 'recording', 'Broadway', 'Cast', 'recording', 'have', 'areas', 'performances', 'exceed', 'other', 'hence', 'reason', 'owning', '.So', 'was', 'very', 'hesitantly', 'excited', 'movie', 'version', 'had', 'great', 'actors', 'attached', 'could', 'actors', 'sing', 'was', 'rumored', 'be', 'faithful', 'stage', 'version', 'including', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'how', 'well', 'would', 'transfer', 'film', 'having', 'finally', 'seen', 'last', 'week', 'theaters', 'can', 'say', 'relief', 'very', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'hoped', 'would', 'suspect', 'admiration', 'will', 'increase', 'slightly', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'now', ""'ve"", 'read', 'interviews', 'watched', 'making', 'videos', 'were', 'things', 'held', 'back', 'greatness', 'still', 'managed', 'allow', 'meet', 'expectations', 'certain', 'areas', 'even', 'exceed', 'others.The', 'stage', 'production', 'really', 'fundamentally', 'singing', 'mean', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'great', 'not', 'everyone', 'close', 'enough', 'see', 'emotion', 'facial', 'expressions', 'be', 'conveyed', 'song', 'movie', 'full', 'close', 'ups', 'expressions', 'become', 'very', 'important', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'boring', 'very', 'quickly', 'only', 'expression', 'actors', 'face', 'scene', 'eyes', 'closed', 'mouth', 'wide', 'open', 'So', 'there', 'be', 'little', 'give', 'take', 'translating', 'film.The', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'complaints', 'power', 'emotion', 'various', 'scenes', 'are', 'easily', 'conveyed', 'strength', 'skill', 'actors', 'not', 'always', 'strength', 'conviction', 'singing', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'excellent', 'example', 'performance', 'fantastic', 'role', 'extremely', 'well', 'able', 'make', 'feel', 'suffering', 'joy', 'ability', 'actor', 'singing', 'commendable', 'far', 'overwhelming', 'fact', 'songs', 'were', 'recorded', 'live', 'filming', 'so', 'actors', 'could', 'set', 'tone', 'scene', 'opposed', 'being', 'recorded', 'sound', 'booth', 'dubbed', 'film', 'later', 'power', 'scene', 'power', 'song', 'Give', 'take.Anne', 'Hathaway', 'received', 'lot', 'attention', 'portrayal', 'Fantine', 'very', 'much', 'deserved', 'truly', 'earned', 'award', 'won', 'also', 'have', 'give', 'special', 'accolades', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'performance', 'Empty', 'Chairs', 'Empty', 'Tables', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'song', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'opinion', '2nd', 'strongest', 'performance', 'Anne', 'Dreamed', 'Dream', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'London', 'Broadway', 'recordings', 'dozens', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'will', 'hold', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'added', 'visuals', 'so', 'much', 'actual', 'power', 'scenes', 'actors', 'physical', 'performance', 'presence', 'will', 'probably', 'still', 'buy', 'even', 'just', 'few', 'certain', 'review', 'Blu-ray.com', 'sums', 'feelings', 'film', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'are', 'explained', 'very', 'well', 'there', 'end', 'also', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'film', 'largely', 'spite', 'things', 'have', 'intention', 'buying', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'few', 'key', 'scenes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'enough', 'justify']",N/A

And the Oscar buzz has become a roar, with American Anne Hathaway's name on the tip of everyone's tongue! British director Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech"") takes a legendary story and brings the (stage) musical version to the screen for the first time. He has a massive cast of talented performers and neither time nor space allow me to dwell on more than a few. Let me warn you however: if you don't like musicals, there are only one or two words actually spoken, everything else is sung.The battles in this PG-13 story are no more than minor skirmishes in the all-over scheme of the French Revolution, but the fatalities are just as dead, nonetheless.A couple of doughty actors from Down Under head this cast:* Hugh Jackman (""Real Steel"") is Jean Valjean, the fellow who stole a loaf of bread for his starving little sister and as a result, spent many years behind bars. (Victor Hugo, like his contemporary Charles Dickens, born 10 years later, was a social reformer.) Mr. Jackman has been embraced by the Broadway crowd and is an established musical star. When he rescues little Cosette from the rapacious couple who have been her caretakers, he sings ""Suddenly,"" the only original song written for this movie.* Russell Crowe (""A Beautiful Mind"") is Javert, the steadfast policeman determined to uphold the law after Valjean breaks parole. Until recently Mr. Crowe had his own musical group, ""30 Odd Foot of Grunts"" with which he performed when not acting or living on his cattle station in the Outback. Usually Javert is played by a powerful baritone and although Crowe gives it his all, this just isn't his type of music.* Anne Hathaway (""The Dark Knight Rises"") is Fantine, the desperate woman who sells her hair to wig-makers in order to feed her daughter Cosette. We've never known Ms. Hathaway to sing professionally before, but she doesn't embarrass herself; ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is filmed ""live"" and is heartfelt and personal.* Samantha Barks (""Les Mis&eacute;rables in Concert: the 25th Anniversary"") is the adult version of &Eacute;ponine, the heartbreakingly loyal young woman who loves the rebel Marius. It is immediately obvious that Barks is a stage-trained musical performer however her death-scene ""A Little Fall of Rain"" is poignant but almost whispered.* Amanda Seyfreid (""Gone"") is the young adult Cosette, taken under Jean Valjean's powerful wing with no hint remaining of her mother's sacrifice. Seyfreid was formerly in ""Mamma Mia!"" Enough said about her.* Eddie Redmayne (""My Week With Marilyn"") is the rebel Marius, who is head-over-heels in love with Cosette. Redmayne's work has been (mostly) with BBC-type miniseries (""The Pillars of the Earth"" and ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles"") but no musicals. He sings ""Red and Black,"" remember that one?* Colm Wilkinson (""Evita"" on stage) is the priest who saves Valjean when he steals the silver at the beginning, and he is there to usher him into Heaven at the end. I loved this perfect touch, as he was the ultimate Jean Valjean on stage. I got the 25th Anniversary Concert DVD from Amazon, and he is thrilling! I'm glad they asked him to appear here.This story covers a generation and has so many layers you may be tempted to see it again just to master the wonderful plot. Unless, of course, you read Victor Hugo's book, first published in 1862. I know I did...about a century later...smile...I'm sorry the production design people chose to ramp up the disgusting bits and the fright wigs.

1000248,A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,B000GAKLZI,J. Chambers,"[1, 1]","I don't often review films, but after seeing Les Mis&eacute;rables on the big screen a couple of days ago, I wanted to express my thoughts. The film is a cinematic tour de force of Victor Hugo's classic nineteenth century novel, but based much more closely on the musical drama that was first produced onstage in 1985. My tattered old Signet Classic paperback is almost 1,500 pages. The film is just over 2 hours, so there were a lot of details and subplots that were cut from the book, but in the end, the filmmakers did a nice job of preserving the essence of the story.A couple of weeks before seeing the movie, my wife and I saw a short &#34;making of&#34; feature about the movie. The really fascinating detail of the movie was that director Tom Hooper chose the most unusual method of recording vocals live on the set instead of the traditional method of pre-recording the vocals in a studio months in advance. Both Hooper and the actors believed that this choice of production method would make the film feel much more emotional, raw, and real. In my opinion, their approach was very successful.That was one big difference between Les Mis&eacute;rables and virtually every other film version of a stage musical. The other big difference was that there was almost no dialogue - every utterance by the actors was in song, making the movie come across more like grand opera than the traditional American and British musical format. And the actors delivered in a big way. I knew that Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway could sing, but who knew that Russell Crowe could?The bottom line: A great story translated into a great musical film, with one of the finest performances in years from Ms. Hathaway in her rendition of &#34;I Dreamed a Dream,&#34; a mournful lament, sung by the anguished and impoverished Fantine, who reminisced about happier times and wondered at all that has gone wrong in her life. It's a beautiful song that wrings a lot of emotion from the audience. By the way, the song that Anne Hathaway sings in the trailer for Les Mis&eacute;rables is not the same version that she sings in the movie. The trailer version sounds more like a concert performance taken out of context from the story, and it's only about 1:20 long. The movie version is 4:38 and really delivers the full power and pathos of the song.",5,A cinematic tour de force of Hugo's classic novel,1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,2325,"['do', ""n't"", 'often', 'review', 'films', 'seeing', 'Les', 'Mis', 'eacute', 'rables', 'big', 'screen', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'wanted', 'express', 'thoughts', 'film', 'cinematic', 'tour', 'force', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'classic', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'novel', 'based', 'much', 'more', 'closely', 'musical', 'drama', 'was', 'first', 'produced', 'onstage', '1985', 'tattered', 'old', 'Signet', 'Classic', 'paperback', 'almost', '1,500', 'pages', 'film', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'were', 'lot', 'details', 'subplots', 'were', 'cut', 'book', 'end', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'preserving', 'essence', 'story.A', 'couple', 'weeks', 'seeing', 'movie', 'wife', 'saw', 'short', '34', 'making', '34', 'feature', 'movie', 'really', 'fascinating', 'detail', 'movie', 'was', 'director', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'chose', 'most', 'unusual', 'method', 'recording', 'vocals', 'live', 'set', 'instead', 'traditional', 'method', 'pre-recording', 'vocals', 'studio', 'months', 'advance', 'Hooper', 'actors', 'believed', 'choice', 'production', 'method', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'feel', 'much', 'more', 'emotional', 'raw', 'real', 'opinion', 'approach', 'was', 'very', 'successful.That', 'was', 'one', 'big', 'difference', 'Les', 'Mis', 'eacute', 'rables', 'virtually', 'other', 'film', 'version', 'stage', 'musical', 'other', 'big', 'difference', 'was', 'was', 'almost', 'dialogue', 'utterance', 'actors', 'was', 'song', 'making', 'movie', 'come', 'more', 'grand', 'opera', 'traditional', 'American', 'British', 'musical', 'format', 'actors', 'delivered', 'big', 'way', 'knew', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'could', 'sing', 'who', 'knew', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'could', 'bottom', 'line', 'great', 'story', 'translated', 'great', 'musical', 'film', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'years', 'Ms.', 'Hathaway', 'rendition', '34', 'Dreamed', 'Dream', '34', 'mournful', 'lament', 'sung', 'anguished', 'impoverished', 'Fantine', 'who', 'reminisced', 'happier', 'times', 'wondered', 'gone', 'wrong', 'life', 'beautiful', 'song', 'lot', 'emotion', 'audience', 'way', 'song', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'sings', 'trailer', 'Les', 'Mis', 'eacute', 'rables', 'not', 'same', 'version', 'movie', 'trailer', 'version', 'more', 'concert', 'performance', 'taken', 'context', 'story', 'only', 'about', '1:20', 'long', 'movie', 'version', '4:38', 'really', 'full', 'power', 'pathos', 'song']",N/A

Sitting alone I cried for the fallen angel, Fantine played by Anne Hathaway. As I watched I found myself identifying with her character and her character's suffering, disappointment and despair. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean found the essence of his character whether he was hating, stealing or later kind and charitable. His emotion was always right there and I didn't have to guess at what he was feeling as Valjean at any time during the film. Russell Crowe, on the other hand, played the part just as he played Gladiator. He was Russell Crowe singing. I was taken with Amanda Siefried as Cosette. Her performance showed a depth of emotion that I haven't seen in her before. Her flute-like voice was perfect and totally complemented the company of stronger voices that could have overwhelmed but didn't. Eddie Redmayne as Marius was a wonderful surprise. I saw him in Elizabeth the Golden Years as the assassin and while he was convincing in that role he was exceptional as Marius. His performance could be light and sweet or painfully sad and suffering as required. His was a performance that sent me into tears. The young men of the Revolution were wonderful. Not one slacked off because they were in a chorus. Each stood out as his own memorable person. There's nothing to say about the young boy who played Gavroche. He took the street urchin role to a whole new level and never missed a beat. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonhomme Carter were perfect as innkeeper and wife. The customers of the inn (the dissolutes) were truly gross, but that was the point. This film is even more amazing when you realize the actors were singing their roles in real time. I've watched this film at least ten times since it was delivered and it didn't lose any impact going from the big screen to my old 32 inch 17 year-old Sony.

While it is sad (I cried through much of the second half of it), it was anything but boring.  I loved every minute of it.  The casting was perfect.  The actors all had beautiful voices.  I was most surprised by Russell Crowe.  His voice has a really pleasant, warm tone to it.  Anne Hathaway surprised me as well.  She has a beautiful, very high voice that can also reach down deep.  I was disappointed that she didn't have more songs.  I also really loved the girl who played Eponine, Samantha Barks.  She definitely had the most professional sounding voice, and I hope to see her in many more films.  Eddie Redmayne was awesome too.  He has a really beautiful voice.  Besides the acting and singing, the story itself is incredibly exciting.  By the end of the movie you feel as though you have lived Jean Valjean's entire adult life with him.

Anne Hathaway certainly deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her work as Fantine.  If there was another performance last year as impacting, considering the brevity of her appearance onscreen here, I would like to know what it was.Other standouts in the cast include Hugh Jackman, of course, as Jean Valjean, plus fresh faces Eddie Redmayne and Samantha Barks from the London theater cast as Eponine.Then there is Russell Crowe as Javert.

Crowe is otherwise well cast as the resolute policeman.The only slight negative I might cite with this production is the sonic flatness of the musical score.

I don't know if the sound engineer was going for a restrained effect to match the miseries of the characters, but fans of this glorious music may be underwhelmed.Otherwise I'm happy to report that despite the length of the movie, the DVD includes some fine extras, including features on the cast, the sets, Victor Hugo and the novel, plus director's commentary with Tom Hooper.So vive la revolution -- and this classic adaptation of Les Mis.",5,Kleenexes Set to Sop...,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,1575,"['What', 'splendid', 'film', 'adaptation', 'beloved', 'musical', 'very', 'moist', 'eyes', 'as', 'well', 'perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'small', 'screen', 'did', 'theaters', 'thanks', 'abundant', 'closeups', 'actors.And', 'what', 'moving', 'experience', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'work', 'Fantine', 'was', 'performance', 'last', 'year', 'impacting', 'considering', 'brevity', 'appearance', 'onscreen', 'here', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'was.Other', 'standouts', 'cast', 'include', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'course', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'fresh', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'Samantha', 'Barks', 'London', 'theater', 'cast', 'Eponine.Then', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Javert', 'singing', 'rather', 'painful', 'then', 'suppose', 'gendarmes', 'are', 'not', 'known', 'way', 'melody', 'Crowe', 'otherwise', 'well', 'cast', 'resolute', 'only', 'slight', 'negative', 'might', 'cite', 'production', 'sonic', 'flatness', 'musical', 'score', 'not', 'problem', 'DVD', 'noticed', 'as', 'well', 'theater', 'reason', 'orchestra', ""n't"", 'sound', 'rich', 'full', 'rather', 'thin', 'compressed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sound', 'engineer', 'was', 'going', 'restrained', 'effect', 'match', 'miseries', 'characters', 'fans', 'glorious', 'music', 'may', 'be', 'underwhelmed.Otherwise', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'length', 'movie', 'DVD', 'fine', 'extras', 'including', 'features', 'cast', 'sets', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'novel', 'director', 'commentary', 'Tom', 'Hooper.So', 'vive', 'la', 'revolution', 'classic', 'adaptation', 'Les', 'Mis']",N/A

Or rather scream.The camera moves steadily to his dirt-grimed face, his pop-eyed reddened eyes, his bulging veins,  that open, trembling mouth.We're within an inch of his quivering lips and can even see the back of his exhausted throat.I was hoping that the use of CGI could keep moving the camera until we were traveling down into the interior of the actor's body to show us how it must look before someone has a heart attack.Director Tom Hooper made much internet buzz when he gleefully announced that instead of using pre-recorded singing, all his cast would sing ALIVE!Bad mistake.It was even bad back in the early talkies when movie makers discovered that singers would look, and sound much better, when they lip-synced to their vocals.Watching all the performers straining to perform live vocals for the cameras was a nerve-wracking experience for this viewer.I kept thinking of the endless takes it must have taken to get the perfect one.Worse, none of the performers sounded any better for being forced to sing live for the cameras.Russell Crowe was so miscast that I winced every time he opened his mouth emit sounds that were supposed to be singing.Anne Hathaway, covered with grime, dirt, her hair shorn, resembled the inmate of a Nazi concentration camp.Her bony face, bulging eyes and hideously bedraggled attire repulsed, rather than engendered pity.Yet, I've read that when she gabbled the famous, ""I Dream a Dream,"" many female viewers sobbed hysterically and had to leave the theater.Okay, call me old-fashioned. I like my musicals to exude vibrant, beautiful costumes, color, talent and story line. Like ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,"" ""Westside Story"" and yes, even ""Mama Mia."" Yes, we all know the singers would be mouthing the words to an already recorded track, but that didn't mar our delight to hear sometimes unforgettable vocalizing.For me, trying to enjoy a nearly three hour long movie that looks like it was filmed through a pile of mud and dirt, where everybody resembles someone whose been dipped in a coal mine, and thin, wavering voices that made me close my eyes in pain, I'll take those glorious musicals of the olden days!",1,How to Recognize a Heart Attack: Watch La Miz,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,2199,"['Hugh', 'Jackman', 'mouth', 'sing', 'rather', 'scream.The', 'camera', 'moves', 'steadily', 'dirt-grimed', 'face', 'pop-eyed', 'reddened', 'eyes', 'bulging', 'veins', 'open', 'trembling', 'mouth.We', ""'re"", 'inch', 'quivering', 'lips', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'back', 'exhausted', 'throat.I', 'was', 'hoping', 'use', 'CGI', 'could', 'keep', 'moving', 'camera', 'were', 'traveling', 'down', 'interior', 'actor', 'body', 'show', 'how', 'must', 'look', 'someone', 'heart', 'attack.Director', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'made', 'much', 'internet', 'buzz', 'when', 'gleefully', 'announced', 'instead', 'using', 'pre-recorded', 'singing', 'cast', 'would', 'sing', 'ALIVE', 'Bad', 'mistake.It', 'was', 'even', 'bad', 'back', 'early', 'talkies', 'when', 'movie', 'makers', 'discovered', 'singers', 'would', 'look', 'sound', 'much', 'better', 'when', 'lip-synced', 'vocals.Watching', 'performers', 'straining', 'perform', 'live', 'vocals', 'cameras', 'was', 'nerve-wracking', 'experience', 'viewer.I', 'kept', 'thinking', 'endless', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'get', 'perfect', 'one.Worse', 'none', 'performers', 'sounded', 'better', 'being', 'forced', 'sing', 'live', 'cameras.Russell', 'Crowe', 'was', 'so', 'miscast', 'winced', 'time', 'opened', 'mouth', 'emit', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'singing.Anne', 'Hathaway', 'covered', 'grime', 'dirt', 'hair', 'shorn', 'resembled', 'inmate', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camp.Her', 'bony', 'face', 'bulging', 'eyes', 'hideously', 'bedraggled', 'attire', 'repulsed', 'rather', 'engendered', 'pity.Yet', ""'ve"", 'read', 'when', 'gabbled', 'famous', 'Dream', 'Dream', 'many', 'female', 'viewers', 'sobbed', 'hysterically', 'had', 'leave', 'theater.Okay', 'call', 'old-fashioned', 'musicals', 'exude', 'vibrant', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'color', 'talent', 'story', 'line', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'Seven', 'Brothers', 'Westside', 'Story', 'yes', 'even', 'Mama', 'Mia', 'Yes', 'know', 'singers', 'would', 'be', 'mouthing', 'words', 'already', 'recorded', 'track', 'did', ""n't"", 'mar', 'delight', 'hear', 'sometimes', 'unforgettable', 'vocalizing.For', 'trying', 'enjoy', 'nearly', 'three', 'hour', 'long', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'pile', 'mud', 'dirt', 'where', 'everybody', 'someone', 'been', 'dipped', 'coal', 'mine', 'thin', 'wavering', 'voices', 'made', 'close', 'eyes', 'pain', ""'ll"", 'take', 'glorious', 'musicals', 'olden', 'days']",N/A

There may be better singing voices in the Broadway performances, but they are too artificial and polished. What this musical does in spades is grab you with so much heartfelt emotion. Many songs the performers do while they are crying! They pause and get choked up while the music waits for them! I personally have never seen so much drama in a musical. Annne Hathway's song has to be the most dramatic song in musical history. Those gut wrenching 4 minutes gave her an academy award. Jackman and Hathway both lost their weight and hair just for their roles! This cast is amazing!The production, photography and basically everything are excellent!

Luis Juarez Echenique ""pepechenique""","[1, 2]","A long time ago Hollywood had actors who were also more than competent singers and dancers, I am thinking of course of Judy Garland, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Liza Minnelli. When they decided to use movie stars in musicals, like Deborah Kerr in the King and I, Natalie Wood in West Side Story or Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady they at least had the decency of using a good singer for the musical numbers, like the much missed (and needed) Marni Nixon, who dubbed Kerr, Wood and Hepburn. But recently something really outrageous is happening, they are asking Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter to sing Sweeney Todd (an aberration), and now Hugh Jackman and Russsell Crowe embarrass themselves in Les Mis&eacute;rables. The vocal demands in this musical are greater than average, and I can't possibly agree with Amazon who says:  &lt;Crowe seems an odd choice for Javert and is definitely outsung by the other members of the cast, he holds his own when it really counts with solos that are on-pitch and arguably even more powerful for their imperfections.> No, his solos are not on pitch, not even by American Idol standards, he quite simply does NOT have a professional singing voice, his singing is pure comedy. I can understand though why Hugh Jackman was cast as Jean Valjean, he is a very likable and charismatic fellow, but the vocal demands put on him are quite simply not met, his singing in ""Bring him home"" is effortful and painful to hear. And why his hair is not completely white? Let's not forget that Marius'friends nicknamed him Monsieur Leblanc because of his white hair.Ann Hathaway too delivers an extremely poor ""I dreamed a dream"", it is true that the woman is dying, but she doesn't have to sound like it at the expense of the vocal line, like any soprano who has sung La Traviata will tell you.I think it was a good idea of Tom Hooper to film the actors live while singing, but to do that he should have used extremely good singers, like Roberto Alagna for Jean Valjean, Bryn Terfel for Javert (what an improvement on Crowe he might have been!!!!) and Diana Damrau as Fantine. The most successful musical number by far is ""Do you hear the people singing"" where at least Marius and Enjolras do sing in tune and in high spirits.In spite of my disappointment with the singing, the film still makes an impression, no doubt thanks to Hooper's ability to tell a story, it's just that it could and should have been much better, one can only wonder what Vincent Minnelli would have thought of this.",4,Where is Monsieur Leblanc?,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,2515,"['long', 'time', 'ago', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'more', 'competent', 'singers', 'dancers', 'am', 'thinking', 'course', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'When', 'decided', 'use', 'movie', 'stars', 'musicals', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'King', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'least', 'had', 'decency', 'using', 'good', 'singer', 'musical', 'numbers', 'much', 'missed', 'needed', 'Marni', 'Nixon', 'who', 'dubbed', 'Kerr', 'Wood', 'Hepburn', 'recently', 'something', 'really', 'outrageous', 'happening', 'are', 'asking', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'sing', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'aberration', 'now', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Russsell', 'Crowe', 'embarrass', 'Les', 'Mis', 'eacute', 'rables', 'vocal', 'demands', 'musical', 'are', 'greater', 'average', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'agree', 'Amazon', 'who', 'lt', 'Crowe', 'odd', 'choice', 'Javert', 'definitely', 'outsung', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'own', 'when', 'really', 'solos', 'are', 'on-pitch', 'arguably', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'imperfections.', 'No', 'solos', 'are', 'not', 'pitch', 'not', 'even', 'American', 'Idol', 'standards', 'quite', 'simply', 'NOT', 'have', 'professional', 'singing', 'voice', 'singing', 'pure', 'comedy', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'was', 'cast', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'very', 'likable', 'charismatic', 'fellow', 'vocal', 'demands', 'put', 'are', 'quite', 'simply', 'not', 'met', 'singing', 'Bring', 'home', 'effortful', 'painful', 'hear', 'why', 'hair', 'not', 'completely', 'white', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', ""Marius'friends"", 'nicknamed', 'Monsieur', 'Leblanc', 'white', 'hair.Ann', 'Hathaway', 'too', 'extremely', 'poor', 'dreamed', 'dream', 'true', 'woman', 'dying', ""n't"", 'have', 'sound', 'expense', 'vocal', 'line', 'soprano', 'who', 'sung', 'La', 'Traviata', 'will', 'tell', 'you.I', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'film', 'actors', 'live', 'singing', 'do', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'extremely', 'good', 'singers', 'Roberto', 'Alagna', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'Bryn', 'Terfel', 'Javert', 'what', 'improvement', 'Crowe', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Diana', 'Damrau', 'Fantine', 'most', 'successful', 'musical', 'number', 'far', 'Do', 'hear', 'people', 'singing', 'where', 'least', 'Marius', 'Enjolras', 'do', 'sing', 'tune', 'high', 'spirits.In', 'spite', 'disappointment', 'singing', 'film', 'still', 'impression', 'doubt', 'thanks', 'Hooper', 'ability', 'tell', 'story', 'just', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'Vincent', 'Minnelli', 'would', 'have', 'thought']",N/A

1000287,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B000GAKLZI,John Kwok,"[7, 8]","Director Tom Hooper has literally rewritten the book with regards to filming critically and popularly acclaimed musicals like ""Les Miserables"" in his riveting, excellent cinematic adaptation of one of the world's most beloved musicals, while hewing more closely to the original text of Victor Hugo's novel; it is both a fantastic and magnificent cinematic adaptation of the musical. Hooper gambled that he could film ""Les Miserables"" by having the actors singing their roles during the actual filming without having them dubbed later in post-production, and not only has it succeeded beyond the expectations of many, it truly feels as though you are hearing a live outdoor performance of ""Les Miserables"". The cast is superlative starting with Hugh Jackman's compelling portrayal of Jean Valjean, as a conflicted soul trying to escape from his penal past; his singing is exceptional, most notably in his soliloquy ""Bring Him Home"", hoping the young revolutionary Marais (Eddie Redmayne) escapes from the Paris 1832 student-led uprising, so he can be united with his adopted daughter Cosette (Amanda Seyfried); so too are Anne Hathaway (Fantine) and Russell Crowe (Javert), with Hathaway giving an especially poignant rendition of ""I Dreamed A Dream"", widely regarded by many as the unofficial ""anthem"" of ""Les Miserables"". (Crowe has been condemned by some critics for his singing, but he shows his ability to sing nearly as well as his co-stars, especially towards the end, and offers viewers an emotionally complex portrayal of Javert that remains true to Hugo's depiction of him as a loyal civil servant intent on upholding French law.) Both Sacha Baron Cohen (Thenardier) and Helena Bonham Carter (Madame Thenardier) are especially memorable as the hustlers who are the guardians of the young Cosette (Isabelle Allen) until Valjean steps in, appearing later towards the end of the film, and so too, Colm Wilkinson - the original Jean Valjean in the London and Broadway stage productions - as the Bishop. Along with the excellent cast of actors, the movie features excellent musicianship from the likes of harpist Skaila Kanga and composer/arranger/pianist Anne Dudley, who has contributed additional music to the film score.

It touched my heart and certainly showed an incredible viewpoint.  I remember thinking how difficult the characters had it; not knowing how real it actually was for the times.  I recommended it to my brother Jim, and he reluctantly read it.  A week later he went on and on about how great it was( for some reason forgetting I had recommended he read it in the firstplace)Hugh Jackman-playing a perfect Jean Valjean- was quite frankly stunning with extraordinary depth and fearlessness.  He tugs at the heart-strings with the horrible fear filled life he had to live.  His humanity shines thru brilliantly in every scene.Russell Crowe was great behind the eyes-he sold it-but his voice was not as honest and booming as the other actors.  Even thou, his presence was strong and convincing.Now Anne Hathaway( for how briefly she's in the movie) was absolutly incredible playing the factory worker turned prostitute Fantine.  The downward spiral of her character, was like a surge of fire from a gun barrel.  A passionate gut-wrenching portrayal of an  abysmal life.  One scene in particular where she sells her hair, then later her teeth, was a gripping depiction of how far we can fall. Anne deserved all the appropriate accolades she received.  Her singing voice was as beautiful and passionate as any you'll hear.  She got as bare and real as can be gotten; even dispersing her beauty for realism and art(something to see, even if only once)The all familar ache of Jean Valjean doing the right thing; was just as agonizing as it was in the book, as well as in earlier movie versions.  The backdrop of the French revolution later in the film; has the inertia of a avalanche( even if you don't like musicals) racing towards the end.I felt the setting and grimness were overpowering; the raw reality of a bygone and violent era were easily felt.  You'll find the supporting cast a bit off, but the direction makes up for it.  The score is as much a character in the movie as anyone-soaring over sorrow and loss-as it moves along the narrative.It takes a bit to get used to the lack of very much dialog; especially if you saw the earlier movie,but the power of those melodies certainly makes up for it.  At 2 and a half hours the film made sense;however 3 hours certainly would have been pretentious and too ambitious.

1000293,AHR9GFUXXEHY0,B000GAKLZI,Jon Thompson,"[0, 2]","I am actually surprised to find myself having to admit that I found this dramatized, detailed cinematic version of one of the great musicals of the later twentieth century to be virtually unwatchable.No, there was nothing wrong with it, per se. The performances are powerful, the look and feel detailed and dramatically sharp. Had it been done as an adaptation of the original Victor Hugo novel rather than the musical, I would probably have considered it a major dramatic accomplishment. The sheer power of it would have been startling.But somewhere along the path of converting the stage musical to this screen version, the entire soul and point of the original was completely tossed away, seemingly without a second thought, and what remains is a disquieting combination of the grimmest ""reality"" video imaginable and a strange, fumbling amature night by seasoned professional performers. Even Hugh Jackman, himself an experienced musical stage performer, seems to toss away his understanding of why a story is in musical form and the vast differences between telling a story with merely dialogue, and telling it with music and melody.That is really the primary question that seems to have been ignored in this film adaptation: Why tell a story in musical form instead of through acted, spoken dialogue?As an actor, with extensive experience in film, tv and staged musicals, the answer that gets drummed into you is that the author's intent is to have the emotional force and power carried primarily through the melody, harmony, orchestral arrangement and lyrics of the music instead of the actual performance.But there is another consideration that most people don't think about. Musicals are almost always written with the intention that they be performed live from a stage in front of a physically present audience. This means that each note and lyric must be performed with a certain minimum level of technical proficiency and clear enough to be understood at the very back of the theatre. The performer, no matter how emotionally involved in the moment, must make their primary job the skillful performance of the notes, rhythm, timing and mood of the song, over and above whatever emotions that performer might be experiencing as they sing it. The author almost never intends for their melody and lyrics to be lost and unintelligable beneath the blubbering noises of a performer totally drowned in a wave of emotion.In other words, the intent of writing a musical is for the sweeping, overpowering emotional impact to be borne by the songs themselves, not in the performance.But there is yet one more element that impacts this production. Les Miserables is not, strictly speaking, a musical. It is an opera. There is very little dialogue (considerably more than in the original staged version), with most of the exposition being communicated through sections, not of spoken dialogue, but of musical resetitive. Even those sections are intended by the author to be sung with a main focus on technical musical proficiency, rather than being ""acted"".The ultimate result in this version of Les Miz is that some of the key, emotionally most powerful musical moments are utterly wrecked because the actors are ""acting"" the songs rather than ""singing"" them. One glaring example is Fontine's heartbreaking ""I Dreamed a Dream"", where the major climax resolution of the final motif (""I had a dream my life would so different from this hell I'm living"") doesn't soar on that quick burst of agonized notes that stab straight through the heart. Instead it is replaced by a sobbing blubber of muttered words that kill that musical moment. Another is Hugh Jackman's Act One epiphany, after stealing from the priest, when he at last devotes himself to serving goodness and God. Jackman also dissolves into a wailing, sloppy mess of words, entirely wrecking the music which was originally intended to carry that emotional moment.It appears the actors based their performances on being in the intimate, close-up environment of film rather than the strict, cooperative, technically proficient media of a musical.And considering the actions involved, the pain, horror, and depressing nature of the story and environment in which it is set, the entire production becomes grim almost beyond belief. If they'd concentrated instead on attempting to sing the songs properly, serving the music rather than working entirely against it, it might have made those emotionally devastating moments more palatable. As it is, by the time Jackman's Valjean confesses in open court in order to prevent the miscarriage of justice of letting an innocent man take the fall on his behalf, the entire piece has all the emotional richness of watching an unending documentary of Holocaust footage. It crams the ""misery"" into such high gear it becomes difficult to continue watching.The same thing happened to a somewhat lesser extent with the film version of Stephen Sondheim's ""Sweeney Todd"", where the actors were allowed, or perhaps deliberately encouraged, to ""act"" rather than ""sing"" the songs, rendering the songs superfluous.This is a continuing problem when attempting to take something created to be performed in a strict, stylized, highly defined standard such as a musical performed on a stage before a live audience, and convert it to the highly intimate environment of film. The two don't mesh well. If you focus on doing the songs properly, as intended, the result on film looks somewhat stilted. If you focus instead on the ""acting"" of the emotionally powerful moments, the music never meshes with the performance, sounding almost like an added and almost interfering background.In this case it turns what could have been a sweeping, grand and powerful musical statement about mankind's pain and hopes into a bit of a sloppy mess of noise and sound and overblown performances that never entirely gel.I won't be attempting to watch this again any time soon. Instead I will pull out the Les Miserables concert performance of the entire score, where the entire point of doing the story as a musical is vibrantly presented as it was intended. that version allows the heart to soar with the music, not shift uncomfortably while watching a seemingly endless and pointless barrage of human suffering.",2,Les Miserables: Miserable,1365379200,"04 8,

But if you are so inclined, please read no further....One author recently provided this contrast: ""If the American Revolution was a success because the leaders who went on to build the country had a proper understanding of human nature, the French Revolution was a failure because the rebels got it wrong from the get-go....the result was the creation of the most despotic regime to date"" (Why Catholicism Matters, p. 20).  Quoting from# 407 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the author maintains the American framers' understanding to be more consistent with the Catholic: ""Ignorance of the fact that man has a wounded nature inclined to evil gives rise to serious errors in the areas of education, politics, social action, and morals"" (p. 21).Les Miserables opens in a destitute, ""miserable,"" early 19th century, post-revolution France.  It is the familiar tale of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), who has been released from two decades of torturous prison after stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's family.Shortly after his release, Valjean steals silver from a cleric and appears headed back to prison.  Instead, the priest intervenes and starts Valjean on a road of redemption.  I found the religious elements (which are everywhere!) to be exceedingly more clear, than I found several years ago in the Broadway rendition.To become a new man, Valjean decides that he must break free of the conditions of parole for prisoner ""24601"" and take a new identity.  In spite of subsequent success in business and in developing an admirable moral character, Valjean's life will continue to cross paths with the relentless Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) - who is hell bent on returning Valjean to prison.Valjean's life also crosses paths with Fantine (Ann Hathaway), a single mom who has been economically raped, in her desperate efforts to support her beloved Cosette. Hathaway's rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is even better than that of Susan Boyle and certainly more heartbreaking:""I had a dream my life would beSo different from this hell I'm livingSo different now from what it seemedNow life has killed the dream I dreamed.""On Fantine's deathbed, Valjean assures her that he will find and care for Cosette.  He then rescues Cosette from the ""care"" of the Th&eacute;nardier innkeeper family (Helen Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen).  ""Borat"" certainly portrays the despicable nature of M. Th&eacute;nardier's character.  Yet, the Th&eacute;nardiers' appearances are over the top and provide a gratuitous crudeness that detracts from this otherwise wonderful film.Fast forward to 1832 and another revolution - young Cosette has fallen in love with the idealistic revolutionary student, Marius.  It is sacrificial love from both the Th&eacute;nardier's daughter Eponine and Valjean, which ultimately saves Marius from himself.  United in marriage, the love of Fantine, Eponine, and Valjean has set the stage for Marius and Cosette to live ""happily ever after.""This is a a wonderful film, ultimately filled with the hopefulness of redemption and eternal life.",4,Outstanding & Better than Broadway!,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,3179,"['Les', 'Miz', 'story', 'line', 'so', 'familiar', 'assume', 'plot', 'review', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'spoiler', 'are', 'so', 'inclined', 'please', 'read', 'further', '.One', 'author', 'recently', 'provided', 'contrast', 'American', 'Revolution', 'was', 'success', 'leaders', 'who', 'went', 'build', 'country', 'had', 'proper', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'French', 'Revolution', 'was', 'failure', 'rebels', 'got', 'wrong', 'get-go', '.the', 'result', 'was', 'creation', 'most', 'despotic', 'regime', 'date', 'Why', 'Catholicism', 'Matters', 'p.', '20', 'Quoting', '407', 'Catechism', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'author', 'American', 'framers', 'understanding', 'be', 'more', 'consistent', 'Catholic', 'Ignorance', 'fact', 'man', 'wounded', 'nature', 'inclined', 'evil', 'rise', 'serious', 'errors', 'areas', 'education', 'politics', 'social', 'action', 'morals', 'p.', '21', '.Les', 'Miserables', 'destitute', 'miserable', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'post-revolution', 'France', 'familiar', 'tale', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'who', 'been', 'released', 'two', 'decades', 'torturous', 'prison', 'stealing', 'loaf', 'bread', 'feed', 'sister', 'family.Shortly', 'release', 'Valjean', 'steals', 'silver', 'cleric', 'headed', 'back', 'prison', 'Instead', 'priest', 'intervenes', 'Valjean', 'road', 'redemption', 'found', 'religious', 'elements', 'are', 'everywhere', 'be', 'exceedingly', 'more', 'clear', 'found', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Broadway', 'become', 'new', 'man', 'Valjean', 'must', 'break', 'free', 'conditions', 'parole', 'prisoner', '24601', 'take', 'new', 'identity', 'spite', 'subsequent', 'success', 'business', 'developing', 'admirable', 'moral', 'character', 'Valjean', 'life', 'will', 'continue', 'cross', 'paths', 'relentless', 'Inspector', 'Javert', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'hell', 'bent', 'returning', 'Valjean', 'prison.Valjean', 'life', 'also', 'paths', 'Fantine', 'Ann', 'Hathaway', 'single', 'mom', 'who', 'been', 'economically', 'raped', 'desperate', 'efforts', 'support', 'beloved', 'Cosette', 'Hathaway', 'rendition', 'Dreamed', 'Dream', 'even', 'better', 'Susan', 'Boyle', 'certainly', 'more', 'heartbreaking', 'had', 'dream', 'life', 'would', 'beSo', 'different', 'hell', ""'m"", 'livingSo', 'different', 'now', 'what', 'seemedNow', 'life', 'killed', 'dream', 'dreamed', 'Fantine', 'deathbed', 'Valjean', 'will', 'find', 'care', 'Cosette', 'then', 'Cosette', 'care', 'Th', 'eacute', 'family', 'Helen', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Borat', 'certainly', 'despicable', 'nature', 'M.', 'Th', 'eacute', 'character', 'Th', 'eacute', 'nardiers', 'appearances', 'are', 'top', 'provide', 'gratuitous', 'crudeness', 'otherwise', 'wonderful', 'film.Fast', 'forward', '1832', 'revolution', 'young', 'Cosette', 'fallen', 'love', 'idealistic', 'revolutionary', 'student', 'Marius', 'sacrificial', 'love', 'Th', 'eacute', 'daughter', 'Eponine', 'Valjean', 'ultimately', 'Marius', 'United', 'marriage', 'love', 'Fantine', 'Eponine', 'Valjean', 'set', 'stage', 'Marius', 'Cosette', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'wonderful', 'film', 'ultimately', 'filled', 'hopefulness', 'redemption', 'eternal', 'life']",N/A
1000297,AD9WTAOAFUZA4,B000GAKLZI,"Jose R. Perez ""Jose""","[1, 2]","I never expected to fall head over heels with this film but I did.  Having seen the original and subsequent stage versions many times over the years, I was both terrified and energized by the prospect of the film.  But I was simply unprepared for the film's eloquence or depth, which for me at least, made the material feel fresh and contemporary even though the words are hundreds of years old.  I practically steeled myself when The DVD arrived thinking I would need to set aside plenty of time for it, though not really knowing why.Over the course of several days, I watched in spurts and starts, at first unable to get thru Anne Hathaway's heartbreaking death sequence.  Nothing I'd heard or read prepared me fully for Hathaway's brilliant turn.  No wonder she won an Oscar.  Well.  Duh. For me, the movie transformed itself into a great film at the 33 minute mark.  By the time Fantine had sung her last note (in this act, anyway) I was a wreck, had tears streaming down my grown men's beard-stubbly face and was practically gasping for air.  Anne Hathaway gives unquestionably one of THE towering film performances ever and earns her place in the cinema hall of fame, no doubt.  Her performance is THAT good and worth the price of admission in and of itself.  She knocked the wind out of me, so I paused, and took a day off before trying a second and third time, but each and every time, Fantine's scenes devastated me to the point where I couldn't fathom getting thru the rest of it!About a week later, I finally succumbed to its magical pull and watched Les Miz from start to finish.  And I came away seeing the film as an incredibly well-realized adaptation of a beloved stage musical.  As a film, it is one for the ages.  Hugh Jackman is the ultimate Jean Valjean in terms of combining sheer brute presence and a powerful made for Broadway voice.  I saw Jackman as Peter Allen on Broadway in his Tony winning turn as The Boy From Oz, so I expected great things from this ace of actors, someone who can do anything!  And Hugh did not disappoint!  With the one exception of &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; which is simply too high for Jackman - or almost any man other than maybe Adam Levine - to sing perfectly, I felt he nailed the richness and sublime instincts of his character. Jackmans Valjean is desperate in his rebellion and earnest in his redemption, but always willing to take the risks that make him - and all of us - human,  No actor has come close to capturing Valjean in as 3-dimensional a way as Hugh Jackman, and in any other year without Daniel Day Lewis, Jackman would have easily won an Oscar for this portrayal.The supporting cast is equally solid, even Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen as the dingbat Masters of the House.  Amanda Syfrid and Samantha Barks were stunningly lovely, while Aaron Tvitt (a remarkable young singer I saw in the heartbreaking and real &#34;Next to Normal&#34;) makes an indelible impression again as he does on stage.  Watch this kid...he will be huge!  Lastly, Eddie Redmayne is a superstar in the making and will be a serious Oscar contender in the future!Much has been said about this movie, good and bad.  I get it.  It's a film that's wrapped in heated debate because so many millions of people have been touched by its sorrowful tale of redemption and honor and love.  At the end of the day, its a movie.  And it happens to be a GREAT one once you get all those critical voices - both pro and con - out of your head.  Watch it and see if it doesn't move you and touch your heart.  That's what a great movie is about, and that's my experience with Lez Miz..A wonderful surprise!",5,Shocked and Amazed by How Much I Loved It!,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,3643,"['never', 'expected', 'fall', 'head', 'heels', 'film', 'did', 'Having', 'seen', 'original', 'subsequent', 'stage', 'versions', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'was', 'terrified', 'energized', 'prospect', 'film', 'was', 'simply', 'unprepared', 'film', 'eloquence', 'depth', 'least', 'made', 'material', 'feel', 'fresh', 'contemporary', 'even', 'words', 'are', 'hundreds', 'years', 'old', 'practically', 'steeled', 'when', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'thinking', 'would', 'need', 'set', 'aside', 'plenty', 'time', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'course', 'several', 'days', 'watched', 'spurts', 'starts', 'first', 'unable', 'get', 'thru', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'heartbreaking', 'death', 'sequence', 'Nothing', ""'d"", 'heard', 'read', 'prepared', 'fully', 'Hathaway', 'brilliant', 'turn', 'wonder', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Well', 'Duh', 'movie', 'transformed', 'great', 'film', '33', 'minute', 'mark', 'time', 'Fantine', 'had', 'sung', 'last', 'note', 'act', 'anyway', 'was', 'wreck', 'had', 'tears', 'streaming', 'down', 'grown', 'men', 'beard-stubbly', 'face', 'was', 'practically', 'gasping', 'air', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'unquestionably', 'one', 'THE', 'towering', 'film', 'performances', 'ever', 'place', 'cinema', 'hall', 'fame', 'doubt', 'performance', 'THAT', 'good', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'knocked', 'wind', 'so', 'paused', 'took', 'day', 'off', 'trying', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'time', 'Fantine', 'scenes', 'devastated', 'point', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'getting', 'rest', 'week', 'later', 'finally', 'succumbed', 'magical', 'pull', 'watched', 'Les', 'Miz', 'start', 'finish', 'came', 'away', 'seeing', 'film', 'incredibly', 'well-realized', 'adaptation', 'beloved', 'stage', 'musical', 'film', 'one', 'ages', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'ultimate', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'terms', 'combining', 'sheer', 'brute', 'presence', 'powerful', 'made', 'Broadway', 'voice', 'saw', 'Jackman', 'Peter', 'Allen', 'Broadway', 'Tony', 'winning', 'turn', 'Boy', 'From', 'Oz', 'so', 'expected', 'great', 'things', 'ace', 'actors', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'Hugh', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'one', 'exception', '34', 'Bring', 'Him', 'Home', '34', 'simply', 'too', 'high', 'Jackman', 'almost', 'man', 'other', 'maybe', 'Adam', 'Levine', 'sing', 'perfectly', 'felt', 'nailed', 'richness', 'sublime', 'instincts', 'character', 'Jackmans', 'Valjean', 'desperate', 'rebellion', 'earnest', 'redemption', 'always', 'willing', 'take', 'risks', 'make', 'human', 'No', 'actor', 'come', 'close', 'capturing', 'Valjean', 'as', '3-dimensional', 'way', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'other', 'year', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Jackman', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'won', 'Oscar', 'portrayal.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'solid', 'even', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'dingbat', 'Masters', 'House', 'Amanda', 'Syfrid', 'Samantha', 'Barks', 'were', 'stunningly', 'lovely', 'Aaron', 'Tvitt', 'remarkable', 'young', 'singer', 'saw', 'heartbreaking', 'real', '34', 'Next', 'Normal', '34', 'indelible', 'impression', 'again', 'stage', 'Watch', 'kid', 'will', 'be', 'huge', 'Lastly', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'superstar', 'making', 'will', 'be', 'serious', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'future', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'movie', 'good', 'bad', 'get', 'film', 'wrapped', 'heated', 'debate', 'so', 'many', 'millions', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'touched', 'sorrowful', 'tale', 'redemption', 'honor', 'love', 'end', 'day', 'movie', 'be', 'GREAT', 'one', 'once', 'get', 'critical', 'voices', 'pro', 'con', 'head', 'Watch', 'see', ""n't"", 'move', 'touch', 'heart', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'experience', 'Lez', 'Miz..A', 'wonderful', 'surprise']",N/A

1000299,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B000GAKLZI,Josh,"[2, 4]","Les Miserables Surprised me. I DID NOT expect to Like this movie because I DO NOT like musicals. I dont know why but for some reason, i find musicals to be boring and uninteresting. But After 158 minutes of the musical numbers this movie gave the audience, I was blown away completely. Hugh Jackman Portrays Jean Valjean (who is a rags to riches type of character) and he gives us a oscar worthy performance. Anne Hathaway won the 2013 Best Supporting Actress Oscar and rightfully so. My god, she was Amazing as Fantine (her character will cause you to shed a few tears). The other supporting cast which consists of: Helena Bonham Carter, Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baron Cohen, and  Russell Crowe all did wonderful jobs in this movie. But I do want to point out two other details. One, there is another supporting cast member who goes by the name of Samantha Barks(she plays Eponnie in the movie) did a really great job; I honestly feel her performance was overlooked/underrated. Two, Russell Crowe's performance was heavily criticized by audiences and critics alike but personally, he was my favorite character in the movie. The Scenes he and Hugh Jackman share are really memorable. The story line is set in the 19th century of France and I will say the atmosphere, the set pieces, the grand scale, the whole nine yards of this movie are insanely terrific. You DO actually feel you are in France during these times. As for the movie itself, well, it just proved that even I now like and have a new appreciation for the musical movie genre. I will always be a fan of this movie which (does not have a lot of dialogue) but is guaranteed to leave an profound impact on anyone. Watch this movie and I promise you will not regret it.

I have also had the opportunity to see it on stage three times, and I was moved each time.  I was afraid that I was going to be disappointed in the movie that I had been anticipating for so long.I am happy to say that I thought the movie was very good over-all.  Hugh Jackman was great as Jean Valjean. He developed a character that was powerful and real and kept it throughout the whole movie.The three actors I was most impressed with were Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, and Samantha Barks. All three gave such raw and powerful performances that I was in tears at least once during each of their songs. ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" ""On My Own,"" and ""Empty Chairs..."" are fantastic.The first time I saw the movie, I was not as impressed with Russel Crowe as Javert as I hoped, but after watching it a second time, I focused more on the acting than the singing.  Crowe has a nice voice, but I think there might have been other actors with more powerful voices to fill that role (Brian Stokes Mitchell comes to mind.)  However, Crowe does an excellent job in portraying a man who is more and more conflicted about his beliefs as the movie progressed.I was also a bit disappointed in Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiers.  Maybe it was because I have seen stage versions where these characters were so vocally powerful that the less powerful voices of these two actors seemed anti-climatic.  I also thought that Carter's performance was a bit too close to her performance in Sweeney Todd. However, they both were able to show the comedic elements of the characters.Finally, I was blown away by the cinematography. Director Tom Hooper and Production designer Eve Stewart created a world which was breathtakingly real.  I thought the opening and closing sequences were especially powerful.Just a note: I showed the movie to my high school drama class.  A number of the students are not big musical theatre fans, and a few are not theatre fans, but were put in the class anyway.  It took three days to finish the movie, and each time I had to stop it, there were complaints from the class.  I could tell that they were not just watching it, but watching it with interest.  Two boys actually liked the beginning so much that they went out and bought the DVD so they could watch it at home.

Making it come alive on the silver screen as it does on the stage  is fraught with perils. Can you make the beloved characters meet a critical public's expectations? Having seen this show on stage many times, I entered the theatre not knowing exactly what to expect. After all of the hype, would it really capture the heart of this multifaceted musical? I am happy to say that it did. I loved that, when in doubt, they went to the novel for answers. This captures the book  better than the stage play was able. I loved the immediacy of the vocals filmed live. Yes, they could have made a 'prettier' version had they used a studio recording. But this is supposed to depict life at its barest. Capturing the realities of a life hard fought. I am delighted that they chose actors who sing over singers who (try to) act. I thought Hugh Jackman captured the soul and essence of Jean Valjean. Not at all an easy thing to do. And I found Russell Crowe's obsessed Javert a perfect foil. No, he doesn't have the vocal range of the Javert's I'm  used to. He has a rock singer's rough hewn voice. Perfect for this adaptation. Anne Hathaway's fragile Fantine, broke my heart. If anyone was the weak link, it was Amanda Seyfried (older Cosette).

The directing by Tom Hooper is great.

The film editing by Chris Dickens & Melanie Oliver is great. The casting by Nina Gold is great. The production design by Eve Stewart is great.

The cast is terrific in singing their songs, well-sung and well-crafted. Tom Hooper has done a terrific follow-up movie to his Oscar-winning masterpiece, ""The King's Speech"" (2010), that is definitely a different movie and also an interesting movie to do, in terms of, Oscar-winning follow-up films. Hugh Jackman is in a definitely superb performance as Jean Valjean, his first time singing in a movie or movie musical adaptation, among the Oscar-worthy/winning excellence of Anne Hathaway's performance as Fantine & Russell Crowe's solidly-crafted work as Javert, both Hathaway & Crowe also singing for the first time on screen in a movie musical adaptation.

I'm a big fan of musicals and was somewhat familiar with the music from Les Miserables (Bring Him Home sung by Colm Wilkinson is on my top five favorite songs/performances of all time), I still wasn't prepared for what I saw. I knew beforehand that the performers were singing at the time of filming, and that is what we saw, so I expected some loss of song quality for the sake of acting, which was the case some of the time. Hugh Jackman has experience on Broadway, but I knew stepping into the shoes of Colm Wilkinson would be difficult for him to do. I was still very pleased with his voice and thrilled by his acting. I loved the fact that Colm did get a part in the movie--he plays the monsignior perfectly. Anne Hathaway was the breakout star of the movie, her performance was so powerful that it was obvious an Oscar was headed her way. Her singing was as good if not better than any recordings I've heard from the musical. She was simply breathtaking. The actor playing Marius was a little hard on the eyes and his voice a tad dated, but he gave a solid performance as did the rest of the lesser-known cast. Two wonderful, scene stealing hams, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, gave us a needed break from the intensity of the film. My biggest problem was with Russell Crowe. I didn't mind his voice; I rather liked his style, even though it was not anywhere near the quality of the other players. However, as the movie progressed, his portrayal definitely dimmed in comparison to the other actors. Everyone was out-acting him, and he was the weak link of the production. Amanda Seyfried was another weak link for me--her thin, high, trillish voice wasn't always pleasing, even though she was suited for the part.

I have seen it twice more since on Broadway and I own both the original Broadway and London cast albums.  I know the entire score by heart.The good:- The scenery is simply beautiful and gritty and raw.  There are certain things that are captured better on screen than the stage.- Anne Hathaway's performance of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" was brilliant.- Casting of Marius and Eponine.  ""On My Own"" was beautifully sung.- Cosette (both child and adult) and Gavroche were great.- Hugh Jackman sung his heart out (but...as you will see in ""The Bad,"" he just wasn't quote good enough - especially ""What Have I Done"").- I enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as the Thenardiers.- The new ""Suddenly"" song fit in beautifully.- Colm Wilkinson's cameo as the priestThe bad:- Hugh Jackman did not have the vocal chops to be Jean Valjean, even though he tried very hard.  I have to admit though that his rendition of ""Bring Him Home"" was particularly moving, perhaps his best song in the movie.- Russell Crowe.  Not only is he a mediocre singer, he was a very wooden Javert.Overall, the movie was good, but I was disappointed that they did not have a professional singer do the singing for Hugh Jackman and find a better Javert.",4,"Mixed feelings about this one - the visual images are stunning, some amazing performances, but key roles were miscast.",1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,1362,"['Let', 'preface', 'saying', 'have', 'loved', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'first', 'saw', 'musical', 'Broadway', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'child', 'have', 'seen', 'twice', 'more', 'Broadway', 'own', 'original', 'Broadway', 'London', 'cast', 'albums', 'know', 'entire', 'score', 'heart.The', 'good', 'scenery', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'gritty', 'raw', 'are', 'certain', 'things', 'are', 'captured', 'better', 'screen', 'stage.-', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'performance', 'Dreamed', 'Dream', 'was', 'brilliant.-', 'Casting', 'Marius', 'Eponine', 'My', 'Own', 'was', 'beautifully', 'sung.-', 'Cosette', 'child', 'adult', 'Gavroche', 'were', 'great.-', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'sung', 'heart', 'will', 'see', 'Bad', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'quote', 'good', 'enough', 'especially', 'What', 'Have', 'Done', '.-', 'enjoyed', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Thenardiers.-', 'new', 'Suddenly', 'song', 'fit', 'beautifully.-', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'cameo', 'priestThe', 'bad', 'Jackman', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'vocal', 'chops', 'be', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'even', 'tried', 'very', 'hard', 'have', 'admit', 'rendition', 'Bring', 'Him', 'Home', 'was', 'particularly', 'moving', 'perhaps', 'best', 'song', 'movie.-', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Not', 'only', 'mediocre', 'singer', 'was', 'very', 'wooden', 'Javert.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'professional', 'singer', 'do', 'singing', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'find', 'better', 'Javert']",N/A

1000369,A2RHV42BTJSVON,B000GAKLZI,"Liolania ""In2Jesus""","[4, 5]","Les Miserables is by no means a pefect film, the performances, in some portions are lacking, and at times the close ups do make the film stagnate slightly, but it is never lacking an emotional 2x4, and hits you right in the gut everytime.  Despite all of it's flaws, it is an exciting and emotional journey that never lets go.Having not read ""Les Miserables"" yet, I cannot compare it to the book, nor can I compare it to the stage show, I have not seen that either, I however, listened to the ""Original London Cast"" soundtrack for hours at a time as a child and memorized most of the songs.  Up until this film version, I felt Patti Lupone's version of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" was definitive, but I have now changed my mind (more on that later).  In terms of the music and singing, they definitely did a fantastic job, and while the live ""singing"" has been done before (opposed to what the Director espouses), and is jarring at first, it proves most effective in a few of the performances primarily in Fantine's songs, a couple of Jean Valjean's (especially the last couple songs he sings), and Eponine's solo.  It does feel a little odd to listen to in the group numbers at times, but once adjusted to, everything sounds just fine.The story being about so much pain and despair, gives it a lot of emotional punch, and not just for the part's Fantine is in, in the theater I was in, I had people crying all around me in various scenes, especially one of the battle scenes during the French Revolution involving a young boy.  This is what gets audiences, not perfect direction or sound or even perfect singing, but heart and an emotional connection, which is why some critics hate this film.  The direction is at times sloppy, the camera work is surprisingly shaky (which is definitely on purpose, but can make the film sloppy), there is close up upon close up, which is always something critics like to rail about, but in this film, they actually do work.The one thing about the camera work which was obnoxious, was the constant same shot, and lack of changing angles, but that's not a huge complaint, as that is fairly normal in older films, and this is a movie which, in a way, harkens back to early silent melodramas, the constant closeups, in a way, remind me of ""The Passion of Joan of Ark (1928)"", I am in no way comparing the quality of both films, but the technique of the shots used in this film, they are used for similar effect, as they were in Joan of Ark.  Keeping that in mind, the closeups didn't seem quite as meaningless, but they did actually serve a purpose, and for audiences at least, the trick seemed to work.As a musical, it works well, music is all fantastic and the big musical numbers are exciting and fun, and for a nearly 3hr film, the pace is kept brisk, while at times, it was hard to discern what the point of the story really was, interest was never lost in th3e characters, and never stopped caring about them, especially Jean Valjean and Fantine.  Even by the end i did care about Javert, no Russel Crowe's singing isn't perfect, and as a singer and voice teacher, his lack of vibrato and zero usage of the diaphragm to sing was slightly irritating, but he conveyed the emotions in the songs, especially his last song ""Javert's Suicide.  Unfortunately Amanda Seyfreid keeps getting type cast in to the ingenue-type roles, which are easy to criticize her for, but she plays the role effectively, and technically, has some of the best singing in the lot besides Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway, but she does at time, seem slightly disconnected emotionally while singing.Anne Hathaway, some may remember, was actually originally considered to play Christine in the ""Phantom of the Opera"" film, but that ended up going to Emmy Russom instead.  Though Hathaway did sing in ""Ella Enchanted"", and is, I believe classically trained, with that in mind, her fantastic singing in this came as no surprise, however, the range of emotion she has while singing is more than impressive, and as priorly mentioned, her rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" exceeds far and above all other renditions to date.  The way she doesn't just sing the words, but feels them is what a musical should be like, and it is the best section of the film by far.The film as flawed as it may be, knows its core audience, and has reached far beyond it well to connect with many people, and not just musical lovers.  There were people crying all around me in the theater I was in as I allready have said, but they were also gasping and even screaming in some parts.  People felt what was on the screen in this film more than any other film I have seen, and it just goes to show, a film does not have to be perfect to connect with an audience, it just has to have a heart.God Bless ~Amy",4,Pulls at the Heartstrings.,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,4773,"['Les', 'Miserables', 'pefect', 'film', 'performances', 'portions', 'are', 'lacking', 'times', 'close', 'ups', 'do', 'make', 'film', 'stagnate', 'slightly', 'never', 'lacking', 'emotional', '2x4', 'hits', 'right', 'gut', 'everytime', 'flaws', 'exciting', 'emotional', 'journey', 'never', 'go.Having', 'not', 'read', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'book', 'can', 'compare', 'stage', 'show', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'however', 'listened', 'Original', 'London', 'Cast', 'soundtrack', 'hours', 'time', 'child', 'memorized', 'most', 'songs', 'Up', 'film', 'version', 'felt', 'Patti', 'Lupone', 'version', 'Dreamed', 'Dream', 'was', 'definitive', 'have', 'now', 'changed', 'mind', 'more', 'later', 'terms', 'music', 'singing', 'definitely', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'live', 'singing', 'been', 'done', 'opposed', 'what', 'Director', 'espouses', 'jarring', 'first', 'most', 'effective', 'few', 'performances', 'primarily', 'Fantine', 'songs', 'couple', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'especially', 'last', 'couple', 'songs', 'Eponine', 'solo', 'feel', 'little', 'odd', 'listen', 'group', 'numbers', 'times', 'once', 'adjusted', 'everything', 'sounds', 'just', 'fine.The', 'story', 'being', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'despair', 'lot', 'emotional', 'punch', 'not', 'just', 'part', 'Fantine', 'theater', 'was', 'had', 'people', 'crying', 'various', 'scenes', 'especially', 'one', 'battle', 'scenes', 'French', 'Revolution', 'involving', 'young', 'boy', 'what', 'audiences', 'not', 'perfect', 'direction', 'sound', 'even', 'perfect', 'singing', 'heart', 'emotional', 'connection', 'why', 'critics', 'hate', 'film', 'direction', 'times', 'sloppy', 'camera', 'work', 'surprisingly', 'shaky', 'definitely', 'purpose', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'sloppy', 'close', 'upon', 'close', 'always', 'something', 'critics', 'rail', 'film', 'actually', 'do', 'work.The', 'one', 'thing', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'obnoxious', 'was', 'constant', 'same', 'shot', 'lack', 'changing', 'angles', 'not', 'huge', 'complaint', 'fairly', 'normal', 'older', 'films', 'movie', 'way', 'back', 'early', 'silent', 'melodramas', 'constant', 'closeups', 'way', 'remind', 'Passion', 'Joan', 'Ark', '1928', 'am', 'way', 'comparing', 'quality', 'films', 'technique', 'shots', 'used', 'film', 'are', 'used', 'similar', 'effect', 'were', 'Joan', 'Ark', 'Keeping', 'mind', 'closeups', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'meaningless', 'did', 'actually', 'serve', 'purpose', 'audiences', 'least', 'trick', 'seemed', 'work.As', 'musical', 'well', 'music', 'fantastic', 'big', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'exciting', 'fun', 'nearly', '3hr', 'film', 'pace', 'kept', 'brisk', 'times', 'was', 'hard', 'discern', 'what', 'point', 'story', 'really', 'was', 'interest', 'was', 'never', 'lost', 'th3e', 'characters', 'never', 'stopped', 'caring', 'especially', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'Fantine', 'Even', 'end', 'i', 'did', 'care', 'Javert', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'singing', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'singer', 'voice', 'teacher', 'lack', 'vibrato', 'zero', 'usage', 'diaphragm', 'sing', 'was', 'slightly', 'irritating', 'conveyed', 'emotions', 'songs', 'especially', 'last', 'song', 'Javert', 'Suicide', 'Unfortunately', 'Amanda', 'Seyfreid', 'getting', 'type', 'cast', 'ingenue-type', 'roles', 'are', 'easy', 'criticize', 'role', 'effectively', 'technically', 'best', 'singing', 'lot', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'time', 'seem', 'slightly', 'disconnected', 'emotionally', 'singing.Anne', 'Hathaway', 'may', 'remember', 'was', 'actually', 'originally', 'considered', 'play', 'Christine', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'going', 'Emmy', 'Russom', 'instead', 'Hathaway', 'did', 'sing', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'believe', 'classically', 'trained', 'mind', 'fantastic', 'singing', 'came', 'surprise', 'however', 'range', 'emotion', 'singing', 'more', 'impressive', 'priorly', 'mentioned', 'rendition', 'Dreamed', 'Dream', 'far', 'other', 'renditions', 'date', 'way', ""n't"", 'just', 'sing', 'words', 'feels', 'what', 'musical', 'should', 'be', 'best', 'section', 'film', 'far.The', 'film', 'as', 'flawed', 'may', 'be', 'core', 'audience', 'reached', 'far', 'well', 'connect', 'many', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'musical', 'lovers', 'were', 'people', 'crying', 'theater', 'was', 'allready', 'have', 'said', 'were', 'also', 'gasping', 'even', 'screaming', 'parts', 'People', 'felt', 'what', 'was', 'screen', 'film', 'more', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'just', 'show', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'perfect', 'connect', 'audience', 'just', 'have', 'heart.God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

1000371,A2LJKDPRVR907S,B000GAKLZI,Lisa Siegel,"[3, 4]","When I first heard that Les Mis&eacute;rables was going to be made into a movie musical, I was really excited.  The only thing I wasn't sure about was the cast...this was before I knew who was going to play each part.  I was basically ecstatic when I learned who would be in the movie...He's no Colm Wilkinson, but Hugh Jackman, in my opinion was incredible as Jean Valjean.  I knew he could sing since I had seen the video of him in ""Oklahoma!"" several years ago.  He's also been on stage several times.  He made the part his own and did a wonderful job.Anne Hathaway surprised me.  I knew she had a nice singing voice, but I had no idea that she had a *beautiful* singing voice.  Besides the fact that during 'I Dreamed a Dream' the camera was way too close to her face, her voice is beautiful and you really feel Fantine's pain.  I just wish that the camera wasn't so in her face...literally.  Other than that, watching her get her hair cut on screen (yes they really cut it there so it had to be done in only one take!) was really brave of her.  Her 'Come to Me' brought me to tears.Russell Crowe....well he tried!  I thought he actually did a pretty good job, but looking at the cast as a whole, he was one of the weakest voices.  His acting was spot on as always, but his voice needed a little work; however, if you look at it from the point of view that Javert is not a nice person and is actually the 'bad guy' of the film/show, then his voice was perfect.  Prior to seeing the movie, I had no idea that Crowe had any musical training.  I then learned that he did have a few months of training for the movie and that he has sung before (I think in a band, but I'm not sure).Amanda Seyfried as Cosette... While she does have a beautiful voice (as we heard in ""Mamma Mia!""), I'm not sure that she was the best actress for this role.  She was perfectly fine with the acting.  It was the singing.  Whenever she sang with Eddie Redmayne (Marius) and Samantha Barks (Eponine), she was literally drowned out.  Plus her high notes are rather shrill.  She was never off pitch or out of tune, but those high notes did bother me a bit.  Also, I'm not sure how many others noticed this, but her vibrato was very fast.  I don't know the musical term for that, but it didn't sound very controlled.  Her voice seemed different in ""Mamma Mia!"".  Looking beyond that though, I did enjoy her scenes.Eddie Redmayne as Marius was absolutely perfect.  He has a beautiful voice.  I had never heard of him before this and I hope he continues to do musical theatre.  Everything about his character simply fit like a glove.  My favorite Marius will always be Michael Ball, but he's too old to play the part now.  However I am glad that they found Eddie.Samantha Barks was also perfect as Eponine. She had previously been in the West End production of the show including the 25th anniversary concert so I knew she'd be great.  I just wish the character had more on screen time!And then of course you have Sacha Baron Cohen as Th&eacute;nardier and Helena Bonham Carter as Madame Th&eacute;nardier were great.  They didn't have the strongest singing voices, but their acting helped to cover that.  I just wish that their whole song at the wedding was in the movie.The rest of the cast was wonderful as well.  I especially loved that Colm Wilkinson himself made an appearance as the Bishop who takes Valjean in at the beginning of the movie.  His voice still sounds like that of an angel.  Having Aaron Tveit play Enjolras was great, seeing as he has been in several Broadway shows.From a cinematic point of view, this movie was brilliant.  It really felt like you were in 1800s Paris.  One of the things that I also found very interesting was having the cast sing live as opposed to lip-syncing to previously recorded singing.  I thought at first that we weren't going to be able to hear some of the characters in certain scenes since there is a lot of noise in the background, but it worked.  Future filmmakers should think about doing this when the next movie musical is made.  I applaud Tom Hooper for doing such a wonderful job with this movie.  It is not easy to turn a beloved stage musical into a movie, but this really worked.If you're a fan of the show and don't mind a new song (Suddenly) and a few music changes here and there (changes in the order of the songs), then I highly recommend this movie to you.

1000381,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B000GAKLZI,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[7, 8]","This was an epic film! This incredible film is broadly scaled cinematically, extremely visceral in passion and extremely personal for the audience.  Director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech, John Adams) did a forceful job of making a true musical of passion and feelings truly come alive with real compassion on screen.Having seen the stage version of the original production of Les Miserables many times, I went in a little skeptical that this kind of production couldn't be translated from the stage to the big screen and not lose its essence. Boy was I proven wrong. Hooper did an outstanding job with everything he had to work with. Based on the original book by Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg and Alain Boublil, (from the original novel by Victor Hugo of `Hunchback of Notre Dame' fame) with the masterful score by Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg, the movie is packed with extremely compassionate moments of the heart and soul of every one of these characters.Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Reel Steel) gives the most colorful and compassionate performance of his career as Jean Valjean . Hugh is amazing to watch as he stars as the man who stole bread for his sister's son in order save his life. He intensely shows his 19 year imprisonment angst and his redemption of character with a true spirit of love and healing. I was impressed with how much of a range Hugh can really play.Anne Hathaway (Alice In Wonderland, Get Smart) gave a literally wrenching and tear evoking performance of the most recorded song in this plays history, ""I Dreamed A Dream"". She is passionate, visceral and real and you can only imagine what her character Fantine is going through. There wasn't a dry eye in the theatre when she sung her last note.Russell Crowe (Gladiator, Beautiful Mind) surprised me as the military leader Javert because I first, could not believe he could actually sing and then second, he played the passion and confusion of the man chasing the bread-stealer over decades as a real person with a misguided mission only to end up realizing he did the wrong thing all these years.Other stunning performances vocally came from Samantha Barks (Grover High) as the confused and heartbroken Eponine as well as Eddie Redmayne (My Week With Marilyn, The Other Boleyn Girl) as Marius who are both star-crossed - almost - lovers. Samantha swoons for Eddie and he swoons for Cosette played by Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia, Red Riding Hood). Samatha has an amazing stunning voice as does Eddie's commanding vocal passion while Amanda sweet subtle and compassionate notes (as she always does) weaned the desire for love throughout.Young Cosette was played by first time performer Isabelle Allen with such realism that she personifies the poster that has always immortalized the play for decades!Special note for Sacha Baron Cohen (Hugo, Borat) and Helena Bonham Carter (Harry Potter, Alice In Wonderland)  playing husband and wife Th&eacute;nardier and Madame Th&eacute;nardier with the frolicking musical number ""Master Of The House"". They couldn't have been cast better and their chemistry together is pure comical magic together.Director of Photography Danny Cohen (The King's Speech, Pirate Radio) did a masterful job at capture broad panoramic images and a dark mood of the troubled times of the French Revolution. Coupled with amazing matte photography and more than period extended sets, the visual were stunning as well.Overall the film is an amazing and extremely dynamic with all the real passion of the original stage production has, but done in a believable and visually artistic way for the big screen. I thought it couldn't be done - and it was done - and done well. It's operatic and may be considered somewhat slow for those expecting car crashes, kung-fu fights or gun battles, but its filled with a real story and characters that should move you if you understand the personal angst of what makes these characters real to the story.

This is the classic story of Jean Valjean, a criminal who changes his life, but lives in fear of police inspector Javert.  When one of the workers in his factory, Fantine, dies, Valjean vows to find her child and raise it as his own.  He finds Cosette slaving away at the inn of the Thenardiers.  Nine years later they are living in Paris.  It is a time of civil unrest and Cosette fall in love with an insurrectionist named Marius.  He is wounded during a confrontation with police and Valjean saves him.  Cosette and Marius are married, Valjean takes refuge in a convent, fearing that his past will somehow ruin the happiness of the pair of young lovers.In my opinion, most of the music in Les Mis&eacute;rables is forgettable, and it is keyed too high for the actors.  The lyrics, however, are beautifully written.  The actors all gave wonderful performances: Hugh Jackman as Valjean, Russell Crowe as Javert, Eddie Redmayne as Marius,and Amanda Seyfried as Cosette.  Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were riotously funny as the innkeepers.  I would like point especially to Anne Hathaway.  She won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for her performance as Fantine, and she deserved it.  Her rendition of &#34;I Dreamed A Dream&#34; is the real show-stopper of the movie.  She did it in a continous four and half minute closeup.

1000414,A1PYHWUZ5SRBTI,B000GAKLZI,Matthew P. Cochrane,"[25, 27]","A couple of years ago, my wife and I saw the musical live. While I liked it, I had a hard time following the plot from the cheap seats and regretted not shelling out $25 more per ticket for better spaces. I found it hard to follow and was frustrated because all I had ever heard was how great a story it was.This time, overall, I was very impressed. Apparently, the singing for musicals is traditionally recorded in studio months or weeks before shooting begins. Then, while the movie is being shot, the actors/actresses simply act out their scenes while lip-synching the songs. This time around, director Tom Hooper (big fan, more on him below) decided to switch things up and record the songs live while the scenes were being shot. The working theory was this would sacrifice some of the music quality but greatly enhance the dramatic effect. Great decision.Did some the singing suffer as a result? Undoubtedly. I am sure a recording studio track would have sounded much more proficient and pretty. In particular, a couple of Russell Crowe solos seemed to stretch his voice to the limit. The singing certainly doesn't approach the soaring heights of theLes Miserables: The 25th Anniversary Concert [Blu-ray] recorded in 2010. But, in the movie, the emotions were raw and the characters vulnerable throughout. In short, the acting was simply superb.The entire cast turned in great, emotionally-driven performances. Hugh Jackman was surprisingly powerful as Jean Valjean and more than ready for such a leading role. Anne Hathaway was gut-wrenchingly sorrowful as Fantine. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were terrifically scummy as the Thenardiers. Samantha Barks probably stole the show in her unforgettable performance as Eponine. Russell Crowe and Amanda Seyfried (the weakest links) both turned in solid performances as Javert, the grim and determined law officer, and Cosettte, Jean Valjean's adopted daughter, respectively.These performances were all under the watchful eye of Tom Hooper. Hooper, though far from a household name - for now - is proving to be one of Hollywood's most promising up-and-coming directors. He first received recognition for directing HBO's exceptional John Adams miniseries a few years back and his last time behind the camera was in 2010's The King's Speech. In short, there's not much Hooper oversees that isn't excellent. His decision to record the singing live as opposed to prerecording the tracks was not the only prescient decision he made.Of course, the songs of Les Miserables are much more poignant when one is properly following the plot! For instance, now I understand that when Jean Valjean belts out, ""Who am I? I'm Jean Valjean"" he is making a profound and terribly difficult decision by coming out of hiding and accepting the consequences for his long ago actions. More lyrics from the same song:If I speak, I am condemned.If I stay silent, I am damned!These lyrics let us peek into the internal struggle of Valjean as he wrestles with his decision to turn himself in or to let another unjustly suffer in his place. He knows that if he turns himself in, he will be condemned to a life in prison. Indeed, he is, in essence, trading his life of luxury for a life in prison. But he also knows it's the right thing to do; hence his feeling of damnation from God if he doesn't do what his consciences declares to him to be right.Fantine's ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is a similarly powerful song about the naivet&eacute; of youth and the loss of innocence (mostly due to her premarital affair and subsequent unplanned pregnancy and birth of her daughter, Cosette).He slept a summer by my sideHe filled my days with endless wonderHe took my childhood in his strideBut he was gone when autumn cameAnd still I dream he'll come to meThat we will live the years togetherBut there are dreams that cannot beAnd there are storms we cannot weatherNow I am pretty sure I could have followed the plot in the movie even if I had not taken the time to read the book. My wife, who had the same trouble I did when we saw the musical, followed it much better this time around also and she has not had the benefit of reading Hugo's tome. The quick timelines appearing as text on the screen alone helped immensely. So I think it's safe to see the movie without already being familiar with the storyline. Of course, it could just be that my wife and I have had the benefit of seeing it twice.Hooper's rendition of the famous musical is simply superb; one of the best musical big screen adaptations in decades, in my humble opinion. Indeed, I think the movie might even resurrect the genre to a certain degree. It certainly has mainstream viability and the ability to capture fans, like me, that don't normally see these types of movies. I heartily recommend seeing the movie. It certainly deserves any and all of the attention and critical acclaim it receives this award season.",5,Beautiful movie preaches grace and forgiveness,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,4907,"['couple',

1000417,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B000GAKLZI,M. Bullions,"[394, 439]","You know I went to see ""Les Miserables"" on Christmas Day. You know I convinced family and friends to not get together for dinner on Christmas evening, as was the tradition, because seeing this film was more important. I've been waiting to see ""Les Mis"" for months, damnit, and I wasn't about to wait any longer. I was ready to see something phenomenal. Something that would be a sucker punch of emotion...and a chance to see some of my favorite actors in a film like I've never seen before.""Les Miserables"" is unlike any film musical I've ever seen. The level of emotion is unmatched. The performances are out of this world. The story is ambitious, and the scope is huge. It's at once a very personal story about its various characters, but at the same time, these people are singing for a generation, that has fascinating parallels to events going on today. It's an incredible feat that I didn't think could be committed to film so well.Director Tom Hooper certainly had the courage of his convictions. A film adaptation of Cameron Mackintosh and Claude Michel Schonberg's beloved stage musical ""Les Miserables"" had been in development hell since the mid 1980s. The pieces for a successful film adaptation never quite came together. A non-musical adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel starring Liam Neeson and Uma Thurman came out in 1998, but that film was sub-par at best.Hooper assembled a cast that doesn't seem like the best fit for a musical, including Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway, none of which, to my knowledge, are trained singers. He then decided that these actors, as well as everyone else in the cast, would sing live, instead of lip-synching to studio-prerecorded tracks. I had not known that movie musicals typically did it this way, and that singing live was a new and scary thing. This element would heighten emotion for the audience. This idea is superb and will show to be a game-changer for movie musicals. Each actor's performance is more intimate and personal than they would have been otherwise. Hooper really wants the viewer to connect emotionally with these characters, and for the most part, we connect with these people deeply.""Les Mis"" follows Jean Valjean (Jackman), a man who was jailed for nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread for his starving family - five years for the theft, and thereafter for subsequent attempts to escape. He breaks his parole, and police inspector Javert (Crowe) dedicates his life to imprisoning Valjean again. Valjean comes across Fantine (Hathaway), an unwed mother who, after unjustly losing her job, is degraded to the point of no return, being forced to sell her hair, her teeth, her body and her dignity. Valjean promises Fantine that he will raise her daughter Cosette as his own, in her absence. Valjean then saves Cosette from the Thenardiers(Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, pairing up in their second movie musical), neglectful guardians and scheming inkeepers, and the story picks up years later, where Cosette is a young woman (Amanda Seyfried), living mostly in peace. A young revolutionary Marius (Eddie Redmayne) falls in love with her. The Thenardier's destitute biological daughter Eponine has a hopeless and unrequited love for Marius. These young characters dive headfirst into what would become a very important part of the French Revolution.The story of the French Revolution, as depicted in the film, is so reminiscent of Occupy Wall Street protests that went on last year - a group of young idealists looking for a better tomorrow. They're willing to die in the name of a future. They're extremely passionate and exuberant. There are protests, except, you know, they're all sung.Yes, it's all sung. Les Miserables is two hours and forty minutes of song. There's no real spoken dialogue the entire way through. Every minute is sung live as well. And if this bothers you, please skip ""Les Mis"" and enjoy watching something like ""Twilight"" or ""Jack Reacher"". Tom Hooper made this film a game-changer for the way a movie-musical is supposed to work. Lip-synching a pre-recorded studio version seems economical, but today, can allow for auto-tuning and editing a singer's voice. It doesn't feel personal. The voices in ""Les Mis"" sound raw and real. The actors sang live onset with earpieces playing piano accompaniment, with a 70-piece orchestra being added in in post production. The music sounds extraordinary. There sure as hell isn't any auto-tuning going on.For example, take Anne Hathaway's rendition of ""I Dreamed A Dream"". At this point in the story, we don't know Fantine very well, but we see the struggle that she's put through. She's at her lowest point. Hathaway half-belts and half-sobs the iconic song, the entire thing being filmed in one take. It's an extremely emotional performance that will bring any person with a heart, to tears.Criticism that I've been hearing of the film mostly revolves around the performances of Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman, as Javert and Valjean. I think both of these guys did fantastic jobs, quite frankly. Crowe isn't the best singer in the world, but his voice fits the part of Javert very well. As for Jackman, well, it could be argued that he carried the entire film. I think he did a splendid job; the role of Jean Valjean is a giant undertaking, and I think he nailed it.However, the real excellence of this film lies in the supporting cast. Everybody is perfectly cast, but particularly Samantha Barks in the role of Eponine. She played the same character in the 25th Anniversary performance of Les Miserables, only two years ago. One small criticism; my favorite part of Eponine's solo (and theme song to self-loathing masochists everywhere) ""On My Own"", the beginning part, is cut entirely. However, once you see what Barks does with this song it's easily forgiven.Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen, who look like they're in ""Sweeney Todd 2"", are great comic relief as the Thenardiers. Cohen is the only cast member in this Paris-set film who sings in a French accent, however... I find that strange. Eddie Redmayne and Aaron Tveit are perfect as Marius and his colleague Enjolras. Redmayne's ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"", near the end of the film, will make you cry. His voice goes to extraordinary places, and in such an emotional number, where he's telling the story of his friends who are no longer with him, this is a place where the live singing truly shines.The live singing, itself, is a huge undertaking, cinematically. Director Tom Hooper certainly had alot at stake with this project, however, there are still things that he could have done better. There are so many close-ups in the film. While they work for solos like ""I Dreamed A Dream"" and ""Empty Chairs"", they don't work for others. I also kind of feel like Hooper used the fish-eye camera lens a little too often, but these are inconsequential criticisms that don't make the film any less powerful.I hate it when people applaud in a movie theater. I find it trite and kind of pointless, unless you're at the world premiere of the movie, with the director and actors present. However, I'm not ashamed to say that ""Les Miserables"" brought me to tears no less than five times. I was completely enthralled by each actor's performance, and the applause that the entire theater gave at the end was completely appropriate and well-deserved. I wanted to watch it again the minute it ended, and for a nearly three hour long film, I think that's a pretty high compliment. Don't miss it.Grade: A+",5,A cinematic and emotional wonder; a film for the ages.,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,7530,"['know', 'went', 'see', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'know',

It is a magnificent film, the best movie musical in years.Director Tom Hooper deserves acclaim for taking the huge riskj of having the singing performed live instead of later dubbing---something never done before.The use of actors who sing rather than singers who can't act gives the music a raw, unfettered quality that is often emotional and frequently overwhelming.  Hugh Jackman is superb as the tragic Jean Valjean, making it hard to believe he's the same actor who plays Wolverine.  Oscar winning Anne Hathaway is devastating as Fatine.  With only 15 minutes of total screen time, Anne's I DREAMED A DREAM is simply awesome!  The most powerful moment, however comes from newcomer Samantha Barks whose ON MY OWN is show-stopping perfection.  Colm Wilkinson's Bishop and Eddie Redmayne's Marius are likewise excellent.  The child actors are incredible, especially David Huttlestone (sp).  Let's remake OLIVER and have him star!

Some things have to be said with more than words, and this musical says them. It has a big heart.In adapting it to the big screen, director Tom Hooper opted for quiet and intimate vocals rather than the full-throated Broadway style. Given this treatment, some of the songs have less impact, and at times their instrumental accompaniment is almost inaudible. But this style of ""whisper-singing"" is so great for the actors!Among a stellar cast, Hugh Jackman carries the show both vocally and dramatically. I was less convinced by Russell Crowe, whose singing was not up to snuff and whose characterization of Javert never quite came into focus for me. It was a pleasure to see (and hear) a shockingly deglamorized Anne Hathaway take huge chances and succeed wildly as the doomed Fantine; and casting the incredible, the beautiful, the hilariously funny, the totally twisted Helena Bonham-Carter as Madame Thenardier was a stroke of absolute genius.The ultimate test of any movie is what it leaves you with, and whether you want to see it again.

The music was great and the scene with Sacha Cohen Baron was extremely funny. The scenery was fantastic but the story was really disjointed. I had a difficult time following. If you turn your head for a second you might miss an important part of the movie. I watched about an hour and a half then I couldn't handle it anymore. Plus I could not handle the constant singing instead of talking (and I love Opera). Russell Crowes's ""singing"" will make you cringe. I suppose if you look at this movie as just a musical and don't compare any of it to Les Miserables then maybe it won't be so bad. The best version, in my opinion, is Bernard's 1934 movie...like 5 hours long. I bought that from Amazon about 5 years ago and have already watched it twice. Way better than the Liam Neeson version. I gave this musical 3 stars because it is very creative. I could not get into the characters, in fact, I couldn't even follow them. Don't know what all the talk was about this movie. I love musicals: West Side Story, Fiddler on the Roof, Sound of Music, Romance and Cigarettes, The Singing Detective (British version), Jesus Christ Superstar etc.. but this one was way off the mark from the original story.

Jean Valjean, having served 19 years hard labor for breaking the law in France around the time of the revolution, is a bitter and hardened man. But a series of events in his life turn him towards God, and on the path of redemption. He continues to do good deeds, even while pursued by lawman Javert.This movie, being an adaptation of the popular musical, manages to stay the closest to Hugo's original novel of any movie or musical adaptation I have ever heard of, and that is a good thing. The musical is also known for its amazing music, which has all been translated over as well. Some have been critical of the music aspect, saying that it isn't the &#34;pretty&#34; music, as it is all recorded live while acting (rather than dubbed in later), and that some of the actors are not very good singers. I admit to not having an expert's ear for music, but I found the music as wonderful as any rendition I have heard, if not more so. Perhaps it is not as &#34;pretty&#34;, but it feels far more passionate, and real when performed this way. I find myself relating to these characters more than I ever have before for this &#34;uglification&#34; of the music, and thus I believe it is all the better for it.Aside from musical purist snobs, or those who simply hate musicals, I have a hard time imagining why anyone would not enjoy this film. It is well worth it, even if only once, for the experience alone.

In all honestly, I needed someone to go with since this is my all time favorite musical and novel. Nonetheless, my mother too loves the music. How good was it? At the end there was an standing ovation in the theater. I've never witnessed that in my life. Yes, it's that good.""Les Miserables"" takes place in 19-Century France that evolves around the story of Jean Valjean (played by Hugh Jackman)---an ex-convict who turns his life around and meets Fantine (played by the amazing Anne Hathaway), an unwed mother. ****Spoiler Alert*** Fantine passes on and must take care of her daughter Cosette. Obviously this is a musical so pretty much all the dialogue is all sung but it is done marvelously. As everyone may have heard it, the actors sang live; no per-recording, no lip syncing. Pure live singing. I'm not going to lie, it makes it even more real and raw. Definitely not a disappointment. For anyone who love ""Les Mis"", they will not be disappointed with this adaption. I do believe though that they could have found a better Javert (played by Russell Crowe) but for the sake of being real, Crowe does a decent job as Javert. So don't judge him too harshly. Another fun fact: the original Broadway Valjean plays the Bishop of Digne! That was a great surprise.For those who are fans of the Broadway may be a little confused because some of the orders of songs have been changed, but if you look at it, it works better this way. And it makes a little bit more sense to have it like this. Just a warning, but believe me you won't even care to correct it in your head.The reviews were right, Anne Hathaway shines in this movie! Her version of the famed song ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is so great that there is no words. You'll probably cry, as did my theater at that part, and at the end. I'm not ashamed to admit that I too shed a few tears.""Les Miserables"" is more that just a regular musical, it's a story that somehow everyone can relate to. It's a story of hope, redemption and promise that no matter if you're in the worse times of your life ""even the darkness night will end and the sun will rise"".  Something that we all need to hear right now. You'll laugh, but you'll mainly cry and reflect and relate. A heed of warning though: this is a 2 1/2 hour movie so it may not be for everyone as it is also a musical. But give it a shot, it isn't a girly musical with a sappy love story.

Soon, entered a monotonous and lingering stage of single performers presenting their singing skills at the expense of the viewers' patience. Two hours and 46 minutes of gruesome singing of not so impressive characters, intervened with few great motions, which would have salvaged the movie into a better play.The task of assigning so many actors to singing narrative play was impeded by the fragmented emotions and intensity of engagement of each singer. Initially, the rhythm ran too fast to permit events to make sense, which in turn magnified the rigidity of the rhythm leading to boredom. The fast rhythm was followed by solo singers consuming many long minutes of singing on the background of still screens.At the last third of the movie, the impoverished characters from the early 19th century appeared as affluent as the late 20th century folks, dressed in modernly designed garments, healthier skin and teeth, compared to the aged ones.As the end closed in, a sigh of relief and half-hearted applause filled the air, as if viewers were finally released from the mandatory lock up worth of $10.5 ticket.Apparently, time has gone by for slow, lecturing on misery and human agony, as people got used to violent actions and extreme fiction, far exceeding the kick from people rotting in dirt, damp holes, and dark alleys.Mohamed F.

1000445,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B000GAKLZI,M. Oleson,"[3, 3]","Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech"") pulls out all the stops in this newest iteration of Victor Hugo's tome.  Adapted from the 1985 musical stage production by Cameron Mackintosh, the movie is large, loquacious and long.  One of the first things you'll notice is that each cast member handles their own songs and does it live...and in one take!  Not only that but Hooper puts his camera right in the face of the actor much of the time.  There isn't a tear, a spec of dirt or a nasal drip that goes unnoticed.  It's actually pretty remarkable.  The film is loaded with talent and every actor handles his or her music well and rarely misses a note.  And when they do, it is an emotional hic up which would be expected.For the uninitiated, the film takes place in Paris beginning in about 1815 and ends about 20 years later.  Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is a prisoner who has served 19 years of hard labor for stealing bread.  He is released but he is given papers that label him dangerous so no one will hire or house him.  Starving and freezing, he seeks refuge in a church.  He then steals several items of silver.  When caught, the priest says he gave them to him.  This second chance changes Valjean who changes his name, eventually becomes mayor and tries to do good in the world.One of his employees at the garment factory he owns named Fantine (superb Anne Hathaway) is summarily dismissed by a supervisor because she had a daughter out of wedlock.  Resorting to selling her hair and her body to care for her daughter she becomes seriously ill.  By coincidence, Valjean discovers his earlier slight and takes responsibility for Fantine's daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen then Amanda Seyfried).  Valjean is constantly dodging Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) who thinks he recognizes the now much different looking mayor.As Cosette ages she becomes smitten with a young firebrand named Marius (excellent Eddie Redmayne) who is one of the leaders of a fledgling people's rebellion.  One of the surprising (to me) standout performances comes from Samantha Barks in the role of Eponine, who is the daughter of a pair of inn keepers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) who housed Cosette when she was a young girl.  Speaking of Cohen and Carter, they provide some needed comic relief throughout the film as the thieves, scam artists and grifters to which they excel.So what, if anything, is wrong with this movie.  Not much, but I'll stick my neck out and say the music.  ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is probably the only standout song - OK maybe ""On My Own"" - and certainly it's hard to hold back tears when Hathaway delivers -  but other than that, nothing too memorable.  The lyrics certainly move the story along as they must.  Almost all the dialog is sung.  If you are familiar with the story, I suspect you will enjoy the film.

I did, however, spend a few shekels to watch the latest cinematic version from Tom Hooper.  OMG!!!  Genius, Tom.  Pure GENIUS!I immediately ordered the DVD from Amazon just to re-watch Anne Hathaway perform ""Dream,"" which I predict will become an essential addition to precious moments in cinematic history.  This cast has made me re-evaluate Hugo and ""Les Miserables,"" and to finally see what I have been missing.  Miss Hathaway's one glance downward and to her left, in abject misery, made me swoon and I don't swoon.  Those of you who have seen this film know the exact moment of which I speak.  Her voice is unique in a sea of voices and her range (working hard on the low notes) is stupendous.Russell Crowe singing?  Russell Crowe was Russell Crowe as in every one of his performances: PERFECT.  His rough, imperfect voice is what we should expect from a life-long cop, but his imperious, murderous glance froze me with fear as only Russell Crowe's deeply sparkling eyes, full of hatred, can.  Even in his lesser roles he commands attention, but he usually turns in a performance that is LARGER THAN LIFE.  In Les Miserables he proves that he can and does everything!Hugh Jackman is huge-o (forgive me) as Valjean.  Absolutely the pitiful protagonist that I never liked.  I am converted to a compulsive fan.  Amanda Seyfried has the sweet innocence of an angel with a voice to match.I was surprised and enjoyably fascinated by Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter who scored bulls-eyes as they usually do.Congratulations to all.

1000468,AMX4202M7D7HV,B000GAKLZI,"M. Secaur ""Meredith Secaur""","[5, 6]","Despite being a great admirer of musicals, for whatever reason, I never got into the whole ""Les Miserables"" fandom. Perhaps this stems from the fact that I find the voices of the principle cast members from the original London and Broadway recordings less than enjoyable. What selections I had heard sung by other vocalists interested me in the music; and, not having seen the show live on stage, I went into this film with not much in the way of expectations. When I came out, I was more than impressed; I was blown away. The music was wonderful, the costumes and sets gorgeous, and the acting...Well, let's just say that more than a few Oscar statuettes are going to be passed around between this marvelous cast.For those who don't know it already, the story of ""Les Miserables"", written by Victor Hugo in 1862 and set in France in the first half of the 19th century, concerns Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a convict, out on parole after spending 19 years in jail for stealing a loaf of bread. After the intervention of the kindly Bishop of Digne (played by Colm Wilkinson), who convinces him to ""become an honest man"" and foster a belief in God, the story follows him as he attempts to escape from his past life--and the dogged Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe)--his interactions with various characters, and the repercussions that these interactions will have. Like the title suggests, the film is not a jolly, old-fashioned, toe-tapping extravaganza. Most of the film is either heart-wrenching or gut-wrenching, oftentimes both, and isn't afraid to deliver tough emotional blows one after the other; yet, despite the overabundance of death and despair, I was inexplicably uplifted and inspired in a way that only a good musical can achieve.It was a genius decision on director Tom Hooper's part to have the actors sing live instead of favoring the more traditional method of recording in a studio and lip-synching later. They are much more ""in-the moment"", and bring a more truthful sound to the music. While they seem to be a bit more restrained than if they were live on stage, which, for anyone who is used to the typically, big, bold sound of Broadway, might be a little disconcerting at first, it makes the performances so much more raw and real than what one typically expects to find in a movie musical; and with almost every song from ""Les Mis"" being more of a soliloquy with instrumental accompaniment than anything else, it works like a charm. Hopefully this will set a precedent for movie musicals in the future.Even if you think you know the songs already, it's like hearing them for the very first time, they sound so fresh and unique, with elegant yet unobtrusive new orchestrations and thrilling vocal performances across the cast. Anne Hathaway's bravura, one-take rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" brought me to tears, and Hugh Jackman's ""Bring Him Home"" is quite possibly the most beautiful and touching version I have ever heard. The new song ""Suddenly"", written by the musical's original composers especially for this film, is excellent, adding some much needed optimism to the score (as well as a nice breather!), and is perfectly suited to its place in the film--sung by Valjean after he has rescued little Cosette from the cruel Thenadiers. Jackman brings a deep poignancy and tenderness to the lyrics, which might be due to the fact that he is an adoptive father in real life.Although most of the dialogue is sung-through rather than simply spoken, the acting is as good or better than in a regular, non-musical drama. Anne Hathaway will break your heart as the unfortunate Fantine, who is forced to sacrifice everything she has for the sake of her child. Her acting ability has really reached new heights, and don't even get me started on her singing. The few pieces to which she contributes her voice to had me bawling my eyes out. If anyone deserves a Best Supporting Actress Oscar this year, it's her.Hugh Jackman is so good as the reformed convict Jean Valjean it would be hard to imagine anyone but him in the part. At last, he has been given a role worthy of his prodigious talents--the only thing he doesn't do here is dance! He so completely becomes the man, transforming himself into a nearly-unrecognizable shadow in the first part of the film, it is almost impossible to tell where Valjean begins and Jackman ends. His voice is powerful and thrilling, and he does a great job of making each song his own. I could listen to him all day. Even if you don't like musicals, you should still see this, if only to enjoy his stellar performance.The rest of the cast are also uniformly incredible, including Eddie Redmayne, a total musical surprise to me, who, as Marius, is a great romantic lead; Samantha Barks as the poor, heartbroken Eponine; Russell Crowe as the conflicted, duty-bound Javert (who knew he could sing?); and the incomparable Helena Bonham-Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as M. and Mme. Thenadier, who provide a much-needed, if slightly Sweeney-Todd-esque, comic relief to what would otherwise be non-stop despair. The only weak link in the chain is Amanda Seyfried as Cosette--her voice is quite thin--but wasn't so bad that it ruined my enjoyment of the songs. It was also great to see Colm Wilkinson, the original Jean Valjean, as the Bishop of Digne.What I found most refreshing about this production is that director Tom Hooper isn't afraid to let this film be what it is, a big screen adaptation of a musical--loud, theatrical, often implausible, and unashamedly heart-tugging--yet for all its broadness, the overall feeling is of something quite intimate, not nearly as bombastic and overblown as the trailers would have you think, and very character-driven. It is the music and the emotions that are epic, not the movie itself. Just as he did with ""The King's Speech"", he makes you become so deeply connected to the characters themselves that you're ready and willing to be manipulated to experience any emotion on their behalf. Case in point, by the finale, I was weeping like a child. While he might have gone a bit overboard with the whole steadycam/closeup thing, it really does put you right in the middle of the action--how often do you go to a live performance where you can see the tears in the actors eyes before they've even fallen down their cheeks?The only real problem I had with the movie was with the plot itself (too many characters dying tragic deaths, too much melodrama, too much focusing on the student revolutionaries, and, towards the latter end, too much time spent behind barricades and in cafes instead of fighting). All of this drags the film out a little longer than it should, but it is Victor Hugo after all, and his work is the epitome of French literature. For anyone worried about content, there wasn't really anything worse than what you might see in your average PG-13 movie, no real nudity, and only brief language, but some of the scenes involving prostitutes were a little excessive at times, and certainly not necessary to deepen my emotional connection with the main characters.To conclude, ""Les Miserables"" is a real masterpiece, with a fabulous cast and some of the most beautiful music ever written. I can't say any more about this film other than that is an emotional rollercoaster, and if you can ride it out, it is well worth the trip. Just be prepared to have lots of tissues on hand when you do.",4,"A Masterpiece: An Intense, Emotional Film With Intense, Emotional Performances.",1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,7396,"['being', 'great',

1000471,A17AIGFMPB611N,B000GAKLZI,Mumbojumbo,"[6, 12]","There are three distinct chapters to the Les Mis story. First and foremost is the original book by Victor Hugo, first published in 1862.  It eventually became considered one of the greatest novels of the nineteenth century. As early as 1935 an english language film adaptation of the book became the second chapter. As the book was an enormous 1500 pages long, it was understandable that the movie was limited in how the story could be re-told. There have been several film (and television) adaptations since that early version and all have been limited by how much they can fit into a relatively short period of time. The third chapter was written when two french men, Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg decided to try and produce the story as a musical in 1980.  It originally only lasted about three months and was severely criticized by the literary world.How ever, just as there is a faction which enjoys great literature, there is a faction which just as fervently enjoys great music and with the english version of the musical (lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer and supported by Cameron Mackintosh of theatrical production fame) the musical became a resounding success.So there we have the three distinct chapters, the book, the film adaptation and finally the musical.  It should be remembered that the musical was produced in the realm of a stage production. As a consequence, the performers needed very little in the facet of acting experience but they did need to have studied theatrical production and of course, have the ability to sing. It is because the casts chosen for the various theatrical productions were chosen for these reasons that the stage production became (and still is) such a success.And now we have those who would like to add a fourth chapter. A film adaptation of both the book and the musical.  Now this is a combination which could only work if those chosen to portray the various characters could both act and sing. And unfortunately whoever was responsible for ""casting"" this production seemed to concentrate more on a performers acting ability than on their singing ability. Perhaps it was considered that as a movie, it needed the ""big name"" acting stars to be successful.After all, who would want to go and see a movie full of ""unheard of"" actors, no matter how good their singing ability.Ultimately, the production failed to produce what it was originally intended to produce. Even the ""big name"" stars efforts suffered because of their lack of musical talent. Hugh Jackman, in his own right is a very accomplished actor but his acting performance suffered simply because he did not have the musical capacity to deliver the necessary combination of acting/singing.  And poor old ""Rusty"" Crowe. Mumbling and bumbling along in one of the most mono tone efforts at singing that it was difficult to know which were his spoken words and which were sung. The whole performance was only held together by some of the smaller name performers,like Eddie Redmayne (a suprisingly good performance as Marius) Aaron Tveit as Enjolras and good old Colm Wilkinson (an old and bold from the theatre) as the bishop.Overall, if they had simply tried to make a movie adaptation of the book (and leave the music to the satge) they may have had some chance of success and that would have left the three chapters of the Les Mis story intact.  If the fourth chapter is ever going to become a success and take it's part in the history of Les Mis, then they will need to keep in mind that they will need to find performers who can both act and sing.  At the time of writing this review, they have yet to find the combination which works.When Cameron Mackintosh was finally convinced to take on the stage production of the musical, he was unsure of the outcome but he took his time and finally with the help of a lot of people in the theatre business and a couple of years work, he put together a very succesfull production. It was a pity that he seemed so eager to rush headlong into this movie production. If he had approached it with the same degree of caution which he gave the stage production, he may well have succeeded.  Unfortunately he didn't and just as unfortunately, he failed.",1,What a disappointment,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,4204,"['are', 'three', 'distinct', 'chapters', 'Les', 'Mis', 'story', 'First', 'foremost', 'original', 'book', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'first', 'published', '1862', 'eventually', 'became', 'considered', 'one', 'greatest', 'novels', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'As', 'early', '1935', 'english', 'language', 'film', 'adaptation', 'book', 'became', 'second', 'chapter', 'book', 'was', 'enormous', '1500', 'pages', 'long', 'was', 'understandable', 'movie', 'was', 'limited', 'how', 'story', 'could', 'be', 're-told', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'film', 'television', 'adaptations', 'early', 'version', 'have', 'been', 'limited', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'fit', 'relatively', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'third', 'chapter', 'was', 'written', 'when', 'two', 'french', 'men', 'Alain', 'Boublil', 'Claude-Michel', 'Schonberg', 'decided', 'try', 'produce', 'story', 'musical', '1980', 'originally', 'only', 'lasted', 'three', 'months', 'was', 'severely', 'criticized', 'literary', 'world.How', 'ever', 'just', 'faction', 'great', 'literature', 'faction', 'just', 'fervently', 'great', 'music', 'english', 'version', 'musical', 'lyrics', 'Herbert', 'Kretzmer', 'supported', 'Cameron', 'Mackintosh', 'theatrical', 'production', 'fame', 'musical', 'became', 'resounding', 'success.So', 'there', 'have', 'three', 'distinct', 'chapters', 'book', 'film', 'adaptation', 'finally', 'musical', 'should', 'be', 'remembered', 'musical', 'was', 'produced', 'realm', 'stage', 'production', 'consequence', 'performers', 'needed', 'very', 'little', 'facet', 'acting', 'experience', 'did', 'need', 'have', 'studied', 'theatrical', 'production', 'course', 'have', 'ability', 'sing', 'casts', 'chosen', 'various', 'theatrical', 'productions', 'were', 'chosen', 'reasons', 'stage', 'production', 'became', 'still', 'success.And', 'now', 'have', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'fourth', 'chapter', 'film', 'adaptation', 'book', 'musical', 'Now', 'combination', 'could', 'only', 'work', 'chosen', 'portray', 'various', 'characters', 'could', 'act', 'sing', 'unfortunately', 'whoever', 'was', 'responsible', 'casting', 'production', 'seemed', 'concentrate', 'more', 'performers', 'acting', 'ability', 'singing', 'ability', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'considered', 'movie', 'needed', 'big', 'name', 'acting', 'stars', 'be', 'successful.After', 'who', 'would', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'full', 'unheard', 'actors', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'singing', 'ability.Ultimately', 'production', 'failed', 'produce', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'produce', 'Even', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'efforts', 'suffered', 'lack', 'musical', 'talent', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'own', 'right', 'very', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'acting', 'performance', 'suffered', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'musical', 'capacity', 'deliver', 'necessary', 'combination', 'acting/singing', 'poor', 'old', 'Rusty', 'Crowe', 'Mumbling', 'bumbling', 'along', 'one', 'most', 'mono', 'tone', 'efforts', 'singing', 'was', 'difficult', 'know', 'were', 'spoken', 'words', 'were', 'sung', 'whole', 'performance', 'was', 'only', 'held', 'together', 'smaller', 'name', 'performers', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'suprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'Marius', 'Aaron', 'Tveit', 'Enjolras', 'good', 'old', 'Colm', 'Wilkinson', 'old', 'bold', 'theatre', 'bishop.Overall', 'had', 'simply', 'tried', 'make', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'book', 'leave', 'music', 'satge', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'success', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'three', 'chapters', 'Les', 'Mis', 'story', 'intact', 'fourth', 'chapter', 'ever', 'going', 'become', 'success', 'take', 'part', 'history', 'Les', 'Mis', 'then', 'will', 'need', 'keep', 'mind', 'will', 'need', 'find', 'performers', 'who', 'can', 'act', 'sing', 'time', 'writing', 'review', 'have', 'yet', 'find', 'combination', 'works.When', 'Cameron', 'Mackintosh', 'was', 'finally', 'convinced', 'take', 'stage', 'production', 'musical', 'was', 'unsure', 'outcome', 'took', 'time', 'finally', 'help', 'lot', 'people', 'theatre', 'business', 'couple', 'years', 'work', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'succesfull', 'production', 'was', 'pity', 'seemed', 'so', 'eager', 'rush', 'headlong', 'movie', 'production', 'had', 'approached', 'same', 'degree', 'caution', 'gave', 'stage', 'production', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'succeeded', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'unfortunately', 'failed']",N/A

I have viewed it as dramatic film 3 times (well actually there are two of the film versions that I have in my video collection and watch whenever I catch them on cable). I also have the musical on video in the form of the 25th Anniversary Concert and the Dream Cast in Concert. It has four of my all time favorite &#34;show tunes&#34;: Look Down, At the End of the Day, Do You Hear the People Sing, A Heart Full of Love. AND the line in the finale speaks to the deep truth in this fine play:  &#34;To love another person is to see the face of God.&#34;I enjoyed this 2012 treatment of the musical. It is gorgeous- France takes center stage; although the actual sites are almost entirely English. The orchestras (four of them) pull out all the stops. The acting is top drawer. BUT, the singing is not as gloriously elevating, or deeply heartrending, or gut split funny as it was on stage. Why? Well....Hugh Jackman as a fine cabaret voice; Russell Crowe is one of my favorite actors and he does a good Rex Harrison talking-song; Anne Hathaway has a good voice better at sounding hurt than outraged; and the rest of the cast is much the same. This could have been a disaster but the directors decision to mic the actors as they did each scene and to record their live singing rather than going to the studio works because it is the drama that carries the singing and not the other way around.I own the DVD because it is an essential part of my Les Miserables collection, just not the best part even though it made nearly $450 million dollars.

1000483,A3DDPQ9342UNMY,B000GAKLZI,"N. Doyle ""film buff""","[14, 30]","I have to give this a decidedly mixed review.My first impression before the film's first hour was over was a silent reminder ""don't buy the soundtrack."" The singing, even from Hugh Jackman who acquitted himself so well as ""Curly"" in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ""Oklahoma!"" is, to put it charitably, just passable. Russell Crowe does as well as can be expected since he is a non-singer to begin with, but the others do not have the kind of voices that are needed to put over this kind of material.Cinematically, it's a bit over-the-top with its wondrous camera views from high places. Nothing is done to suggest that the squalor isn't real. The mud is as muddy as possible and the make-up (in extreme close-ups of Anne Hathaway for example), is enough to convince us that these wretched people had nothing to sing about.Not being a fan of the show and familiar with only a couple of the songs, I was not expecting to be thrilled by the score alone--and I wasn't. Whether you have an appetite for these kind of musical numbers is clearly a matter of taste. Most of the lyrics are as downbeat and desperate as the story itself suggests.A much needed touch of humor is furnished by Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen, although some of the humor is a bit gross and overdone.The almost unrecognizable first appearance of Hugh Jackman as a slave hauling a ship with his comrades as Javert (Russell Crowe) looks on, is an astonishing moment. Jackman looks nothing like his real self, so part of his performance can be attributed to a marvelous make-up job. But he does well with the anguish and pain of seeing so much suffering around him. Anne Hathaway is obviously a singer/actress who does all she can with the powerful emotions she displays in her big scene, but her role, although noteworthy, is a small one in the scheme of things.Despite the power of some of the performances, the overall effect for me was a story that was not well told because of script problems, making it a confusing mess for anyone not familiar with the basic outline of the tale since it leaves out important plot details.Your musical taste will decide whether or not you love or hate this film, but it's fair to say that the songs are not rendered in the best possible way by having them performed live. The pre-recording of all the lyrics would have enhanced the big numbers which required more vocal ability and professional technique than is offered here.Summing up: Definitely not for everyone, but the squalor of the French Revolution period is magnificently realistic with lavish, detailed sets and costumes that convey the right atmosphere. Stunning photography is evident in the final scene where Crowe's conscience forces him to take drastic action.Biggest flaw: The lack of tension and connection in the cat-and-mouse game between Crowe and Jackman that was so powerfully portrayed in straight dramatic versions of the story filmed previously which sharpened the suspense. Both the '35 and '52 versions had this added strength of characterization. Instead, Crowe's realizaton that he has found and recognizes Valjean is done much too casually to have any real effect in building suspense.",3,Epic tale would have been more impressive with real singers...,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,3187,"['have', 'give', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'review.My', 'first', 'impression', 'film', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'over', 'was', 'silent', 'reminder', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'singing', 'even', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'who', 'acquitted', 'so', 'well', 'Curly', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'musical', 'Oklahoma', 'put', 'charitably', 'just', 'passable', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'non-singer', 'begin', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'kind', 'voices', 'are', 'needed', 'put', 'over', 'kind', 'material.Cinematically', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'wondrous', 'camera', 'views', 'high', 'places', 'Nothing', 'done', 'suggest', 'squalor', ""n't"", 'real', 'mud', 'as', 'muddy', 'possible', 'make-up', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'example', 'enough', 'convince', 'wretched', 'people', 'had', 'nothing', 'sing', 'about.Not', 'being', 'fan', 'show', 'familiar', 'only', 'couple', 'songs', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'be', 'thrilled', 'score', 'alone', 'was', ""n't"", 'Whether', 'have', 'appetite', 'kind', 'musical', 'numbers', 'clearly', 'matter', 'taste', 'Most', 'lyrics', 'are', 'downbeat', 'desperate', 'story', 'suggests.A', 'much', 'needed', 'touch', 'humor', 'furnished', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'humor', 'bit', 'gross', 'overdone.The', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'first', 'appearance', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'slave', 'hauling', 'ship', 'comrades', 'Javert', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'astonishing', 'moment', 'Jackman', 'nothing', 'real', 'self', 'part', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'marvelous', 'make-up', 'job', 'well', 'anguish', 'pain', 'seeing', 'so', 'much', 'suffering', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'obviously', 'singer/actress', 'who', 'can', 'powerful', 'emotions', 'big', 'scene', 'role', 'noteworthy', 'small', 'one', 'scheme', 'power', 'performances', 'overall', 'effect', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'told', 'script', 'problems', 'making', 'confusing', 'mess', 'anyone', 'not', 'familiar', 'basic', 'outline', 'tale', 'out', 'important', 'plot', 'details.Your', 'musical', 'taste', 'will', 'decide', 'not', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'fair', 'say', 'songs', 'are', 'not', 'rendered', 'best', 'possible', 'way', 'having', 'performed', 'live', 'pre-recording', 'lyrics', 'would', 'have', 'enhanced', 'big', 'numbers', 'required', 'more', 'vocal', 'ability', 'professional', 'technique', 'offered', 'here.Summing', 'up', 'Definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'squalor', 'French', 'Revolution', 'period', 'magnificently', 'realistic', 'lavish', 'detailed', 'sets', 'costumes', 'convey', 'right', 'atmosphere', 'Stunning', 'photography', 'evident', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'Crowe', 'conscience', 'take', 'drastic', 'action.Biggest', 'flaw', 'lack', 'tension', 'connection', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'Crowe', 'Jackman', 'was', 'so', 'powerfully', 'portrayed', 'straight', 'dramatic', 'versions', 'story', 'filmed', 'previously', 'sharpened', 'suspense', ""'35"", ""'52"", 'versions', 'had', 'added', 'strength', 'characterization', 'Instead', 'Crowe', 'realizaton', 'found', 'recognizes', 'Valjean', 'done', 'much', 'too', 'casually', 'have', 'real', 'effect', 'building', 'suspense']",N/A

1000493,A1DJYI522AO1MN,B000GAKLZI,"Noah Arsenault ""Winter's Read""","[32, 38]","I think it's safe to say that waiting for this film was pretty agonizing, both for director Tom Hooper's recent successes in The King's Speech and the John Adams mini-series, for for the renown that this book/play/film has accumulated ever since Victor Hugo penned it, and for the well-known cast that has shown a different talent through viral trailers.Because I don't know the full history of film adaptions, I won't be delving into the comparisons with such, but the history of the London (Queen's Theatre) play has been on the mind, since I took a trip there this spring to watch it performed live. It was an unforgettable experience, and while this adaption had a few pitfalls, it came close to that in many ways.An inescapable topic is the singing. In the first scene, Crowe (Javert) and Jackman (Valjean) moved the words into odd tempos, and their voices sounded a bit shallow (Crowe's in particular). With the exception of a great (if short) sequence, ""A Work"", it was a poor opening on the musical front, and they tried to erase it from our memory by quickly distracting us with landscape shots. After that, both Crowe and Jackman got louder, bolder, and much more appreciable. Anne Hathaway as Fantine was amazing. She provided one of the three best song performances in ""I Dreamed A Dream"", which was very heartbreaking and hardening. Next up comes Young Cosette, who did very well with ""Castle on a Cloud,"" and made viewers sorry that they didn't hear more from her. Helena Bonham Carter did respectably, I suppose, but Sacha Baron Cohen's not a singer, and ""Master of the House"" had to rely solely on the acting and humor. The real disappointment, though, was Amanda Seyfried (Cosette), in my opinion. While her voice may be very good in other circumstances, her shallow trill didn't do justice to the opera-level voices that Les Mis has seen in the past. Instead, I favored Samantha Barks (&Eacute;ponine) in every way, including acting. Her ""On My Own"" was possibly my favorite song from the whole film, and definitely making the top three. Finally, there is Eddie Redmayne (Marius). He is definitely a talented actor I will be watching for. And, he's a marvelous singer, too! Very down to earth, and very loud and bold when he ought to be. His ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" also makes the top 3.As usual, there were some problems I had with the edits. Here and there, lyrics were changed, removed, and even added, which disappointed me. The worst part, I think, is when they cut nearly the entirety of ""Turning"" after uttering only a few lines. I can only hope it will come out complete in the extended version.**SPOILER ALERT** As my final point, for the whole movie, I'd been wondering how Hooper would portray Javert's suicide. I think he did it very well, and it was my favorite scene in the entire movie, for Crowe's great performance in it, the allusion from earlier in the film, the great scope and imager, and for Crowe's final song, in which he brings his best to the table. I had no idea he was as great a singer as he was at his character's final moments. **END SPOILER**I would not suggest this movie for kids under 13, because they simply wouldn't understand a lot of the underlying themes that make this movie really important. Also, there is some suggestive,  inappropriate material after Fontine is removed from the factory and resorts to the docks.In conclusion, this is a large-scale, impressive adaption that is definitely worth seeing as soon as you can manage, even if you aren't a big fan of musicals.",5,"A few issues, but otherwise magnificent.",1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,3540,"['think', 'safe', 'say', 'waiting', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'agonizing', 'director', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'recent', 'successes', 'King', 'Speech', 'John', 'Adams', 'mini-series', 'renown', 'book/play/film', 'accumulated', 'ever', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'penned', 'well-known', 'cast', 'shown', 'different', 'talent', 'viral', 'trailers.Because', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'full', 'history', 'film', 'adaptions', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'delving', 'comparisons', 'such', 'history', 'London', 'Queen', 'Theatre', 'play', 'been', 'mind', 'took', 'trip', 'there', 'spring', 'watch', 'performed', 'live', 'was', 'unforgettable', 'experience', 'adaption', 'had', 'few', 'pitfalls', 'came', 'close', 'many', 'ways.An', 'inescapable', 'topic', 'singing', 'first', 'scene', 'Crowe', 'Javert', 'Jackman', 'Valjean', 'moved', 'words', 'odd', 'tempos', 'voices', 'sounded', 'bit', 'shallow', 'Crowe', 'particular', 'exception', 'great', 'short', 'sequence', 'Work', 'was', 'poor', 'opening', 'musical', 'front', 'tried', 'erase', 'memory', 'quickly', 'distracting', 'landscape', 'shots', 'Crowe', 'Jackman', 'got', 'louder', 'bolder', 'much', 'more', 'appreciable', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Fantine', 'was', 'amazing', 'provided', 'one', 'three', 'best', 'song', 'performances', 'Dreamed', 'Dream', 'was', 'very', 'heartbreaking', 'hardening', 'Next', 'up', 'Young', 'Cosette', 'who', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'Castle', 'Cloud', 'made', 'viewers', 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'more', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'did', 'respectably', 'suppose', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'not', 'singer', 'Master', 'House', 'had', 'rely', 'solely', 'acting', 'humor', 'real', 'disappointment', 'was', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'Cosette', 'opinion', 'voice', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'other', 'circumstances', 'shallow', 'trill', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'opera-level', 'voices', 'Les', 'Mis', 'seen', 'past', 'Instead', 'favored', 'Samantha', 'Barks', 'Eacute', 'ponine', 'way', 'including', 'acting', 'My', 'Own', 'was', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'song', 'whole', 'film', 'definitely', 'making', 'top', 'three', 'Finally', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'Marius', 'definitely', 'talented', 'actor', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'marvelous', 'singer', 'too', 'Very', 'down', 'earth', 'very', 'loud', 'bold', 'when', 'ought', 'be', 'Empty', 'Chairs', 'Empty', 'Tables', 'also', 'top', '3.As', 'usual', 'were', 'problems', 'had', 'edits', 'Here', 'there', 'lyrics', 'were', 'changed', 'removed', 'even', 'added', 'disappointed', 'worst', 'part', 'think', 'when', 'cut', 'nearly', 'entirety', 'Turning', 'uttering', 'only', 'few', 'lines', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'complete', 'extended', 'version', '**SPOILER', 'ALERT**', 'final', 'point', 'whole', 'movie', ""'d"", 'been', 'wondering', 'how', 'Hooper', 'would', 'portray', 'Javert', 'suicide', 'think', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'favorite', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'Crowe', 'great', 'performance', 'allusion', 'earlier', 'film', 'great', 'scope', 'imager', 'Crowe', 'final', 'song', 'best', 'table', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'as', 'great', 'singer', 'was', 'character', 'final', 'moments', '**END', 'SPOILER**I', 'would', 'not', 'suggest', 'movie', 'kids', '13', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'lot', 'underlying', 'themes', 'make', 'movie', 'really', 'important', 'Also', 'suggestive', 'inappropriate', 'material', 'Fontine', 'removed', 'factory', 'resorts', 'docks.In', 'conclusion', 'large-scale', 'impressive', 'adaption', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'manage', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'musicals']",N/A

1000497,A237RLQXTL55RG,B000GAKLZI,off the tropic,"[5, 14]","The definitive version of ""Les Miserables"" for our time is Bille August's brilliant telling of that story with Liam Neeson doing full justice to the grandeur of Jean Valjean's Christ-like persona and Geoffrey Rush unforgettably menacing as the perversely principled, and ultimately tragic, Inspector Javert. The equally important role of Fantine was interpreted with Uma Thurman's intense pathos and Claire Danes rounded out that superb cast with an impressive rendition of Cosette.I continue to look back at the sheer artistry of this film,  its success in crystallizing the core depth of the main characters and its remarkable incisiveness in transposing the profound dramatic theme of that massive novel in an effective, highly dense, two hour film, as a small miracle in the recent history of great literary adaptations in cinema.I began this year at the movies with the hope that the much lauded and anticipated Tom Hooper 2012 musical version would conserve the spirit of the novel in the way Bille August did it fifteen years ago. Tom Hooper's imaginative feat is impressive and his screening of Amanda Seyfried, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, and Russell Crowe as Cosette, Jean Valjean, Fantine, Marius, and Inspector Javert, respectively, has merit. There is much inspired labor that has gone into Tom Hooper's ""Les Miserables""  with the individual reprisals of each of its characters, with their accompanying songs, capturing the emotional ""highs"" of the novel.But the Hooper version of the great epic does not live up to its promise. While it is a good adaptation of the novel it falls short of the artistic merit of the definitive 1998 Bille August adaptation. This is not to say that the impressive sets and exacting imagination of Tom Hooper does not touch the high emotional notes of that drama. All this is to be found in this version. But when all we have are high emotional notes the pitch of tragedy is drowned out. The poetics of tragedy need the emotional lows to set the emotional highs in appropriate contrast between the characters of Javert and Jean Valjean; the much needed interlude of speech was found wanting. Prose as much as the poetry of song was needed to let the emotional weight of the characters permeate our consciousness. We long for the music, fantastic as it is in moments, to quieten for a while, and let the drama emerge in turns through conversation, through the ellipses of spoken discourse. If only this was an adaptation where song and dialogue blended into each other to set the contrasts of emotion that much more stark in some of those brilliant song numbers.The spirit of the novel, its tragic sense, in its telling contrasts of the characters of Jean Valjean and Inspector Javert is diluted, even stunted, in this musical adaptation. This is an odd problem that I have seen recur in the famed broadway staged version as well. The deepest emotional moments in the book are often found in the quieter moments of this great melodrama. It as if the key reversals in the drama, Jean Valjean's conversion in the early book, and Inspector Javert's defeat in the end, required music interspersed by long intervals of silence, to let the emotions drop into our soul at the end of long protracted building up of character. The dramatic might of a character like Javert and Jean Valjean in this version is allowed to emerge in a musical narrative in an episodic fashion. The episodic musical set pieces when characters break into song take turns building and demolishing the character.Hugh Jackman proves he is a formidable talent. He is all there, in character, from those unrecognizable shots of him as a bloodshot, worn down, helpless convict he has become under Javert's whip and chains, to those images of utter control, dignity, and empathy as the Mayor of Montreuil-sur-mer. Jackman surely succeeds as Jean Valjean, he does all he can, and he cannot do more. But where he succeeds gloriously in his convincingly commanding voice of the saint-like ex-convict, he soon bumps up against the formalistic restrictions of a purely musical performance.Anne Hathaway succeeds poignantly as Fantine; but if only she was allowed to lapse into speech, to have her ""settle"" in to that wonderful character that was waiting to be further developed. Amanda Seyfried is beautiful in her fragile and luminescent way and her looks have a way of settling her into character in her more modest role. Her singing is exquisite but she is also allowed to linger and take in the rhythms of her character a lot more than the central characters. The biggest surprise was Eddie Redmayne, who has the single most emotionally wrenching song, after he loses his comrades in battle. Like the Cosette character, Marius as supporting actor, is not overburdened by belting out one song after another. The supporting actors are done a great service by being left to define their performances as much by silence as by song.The shock of the film was the Inspector Javert character. I expected Russell Crowe to be as effective, if not more striking, as the Geoffrey Rush rendition of Javert in the 1998 version. His performance, good and respectable as it was, was not characteristically inspired. This is after all the great Russell Crowe, an actor who seemed to carry the burden of lifting the standards of acting single-handedly during a period when acting in American film needed a new face and voice. His great performances in The Insider, Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind, Master and Commander, Robin Hood, The Last Three Days set me up for another inspired performance. Like Brando, Crowe has had the remarkable ability of transcending the movies he has been in and if there is any actor who  could breathe new life into a film of the scale and power of ""Les Miserables"", after Geoffrey Rush's inspired turn, it would be him. Crowe has the range and subtlety to bring a fresh interpretation to the venomous, perverse, and tragic Inspector Javert.But it was not to be. This is Jackman's film from the first to the last frame. Crowe is strangely disengaged in the role. The crucial moment of reversal in Inspector Javert's life, during his great moment of resignation at the end of film when he admits to being wrong, and he submits to Jean Valjean's superior principle of compassion, ought to be the point of emotional climax in the film. In Hooper's hands this moment becomes a bombastic moment that undoes the dramatic power of the moment. The numbing paradox of following the law down to the letter is Javert's supreme moment of recognition; see how beautifully Bille August sets about capturing the emotion of this scene. Geoffrey Rush as Javert proves that the emotion at this moment is one of quiet failure. It is a crushing moment for Javert and a moment of release for Jean Valjean. The sense of tragedy is that of good triumphing over evil in a muted, subdued, way. There is a dignified admission of failure, but there is hardly a celebration of victory on the part of Valjean. This is a sad moment for both of them. During this supposedly meditative moment Hooper makes the wrong decision to have Crowe break out into song. The singing seems so out of place. I was hoping that Crowe would be spared here and allowed to lapse into speech; not because he is not a good singer here, he ably is,  but because this dramatic moment called for a quieter form of emotional depth, an almost lyrical moment of silence, a hushed soliloquy at best, rather than an operatic burst into song.To say that this 2012 version of Victor Hugo's epic, is a good, rather than great, version of ""Les Miserables"" is to say first that this film succeeds in scattered, though, inspired episodic moments of song and character. Tom Hooper's labor of love was, however, not translated well to an effective poetics on screen and was not sustained in the form of an emotional tour-de-force of a drama of good triumphing over evil, which was what that 1998 version superbly brought about in the perfect casting and performances of Geoffrey Rush and Liam Neeson. To register this distinction between good and great literary adaptations I recommend seeing both these versions as closely together as you possibly can. It will give you a sense of how the use and abuse of music has the net effect of diluting the emotional contrasts of the story.",3,Les Mis fall short,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,8343,"['definitive',

The music was well done. I wouldn't be able to tell which songs were missing. I noticed that during a lot of the songs, it was just a close up on the actor singing it the whole time. I found that stylistic choice strange, but at the same time, it was nice to see the emotion close up in the actor's face. That is something you don't get if you are sitting fifty feet away from the performer in the musical play. The movie got through Hugh Jackman's character's story well. But I didn't find myself terribly compelled by his adopted daughter's love story with the young revolutionist. I don't know if it is developed more in the musical, but I really did not care about their relationship at all. Now a note on the PG-13 rating: It definitely deserved the PG-13 rating it received. The sexual content mentioned in the mpaa rating is actually more graphic than you'd expect. There are two sex scenes where it is very clear what is going on. So you might want to think about that if you are taking younger kids.

The script and some of the characterizations are DIFFERENT from the stage play. But I've seen the play more times than I can count, and I would have to say that I have seen bigger differences between one professional production and the next.Before this came out, I read the book, then rewatched the Liam Neeson version and tried to watch the Michael Rennie version.  My conclusion from reading the book is that there are so many characters, so much backstory, so many Dickensian plot twists, etc. that ANYBODY who can make a single coherent story out of the thing without it being ten hours long deserves great praise. By the way, if you question this sentence, try reading JUST the Wikipedia plot summary - it will leave your head spinning, and it leaves out numerous characters to whom Hugo gave backstories and plot arcs, as well as several plot twists.I especially enjoyed the inclusion of visual elements that were compelling in the book but which would have been impossible or distracting to present onstage.  These include the decrepit war-memorial elephant in which Gavroche lives, the geometry of the streets and buildings where Enjolras and his comrades erect the barricades, the bottomless pit in the sewers that nearly costs Jean Valjean and Marius their lives, and the confluence of watersheds into which Javert leaps, ensuring his death.  Other changes that folks have found disturbing express the spirit of the book, even if they're not technically from either the book or the play.  This includes Javert showing Gavroche honor at the end.  Frankly, I don't mind that the director used that original scene to replace a whole (and somewhat silly) chapter that shows Javert's growing crisis of conscience.The ""reviewer"" who complains that Anne Hathaway played Fantine as TOO miserable obviously hasn't read the book.  Or paid attention to its title, apparently.  With the exception of Russell Crowe, who seemed to hit one emotional note and maybe three musical notes throughout the entire movie, the cast was well-chosen and each brought their ""A-game.""  By the way, this is the only Eponine I have ever found truly sympathetic (most never get beyond pitiable).Some have chosen to complain about plot elements which seem weak in the play and still seem weak on the screen, such as Marius and Cosette falling in love ""at first sight.""  Well, ""A Heart Full of Love"" is not my favorite song ever, but it's better than reading Hugo's FOUR chapters about why ""love at first sight"" happens.  Again, kudos to both the play and the movie for successfully bridging that gap and many others that are even more awkward in the book than they are in the play or screen.Thanks again to the musical producers who managed to get a coherent, compelling presentation out of a massive, complex, and sometimes contradictory tome, and to the movie producers who managed to be as true as possible to both the book and the musical while still making a ridiculously good movie.  - Paul Race, School Of The Rock",5,Faithful to the book and play,1363132800,"03 13, 2013",2013,3079,"['Many', 'musicals', 'have', 'failed', 'transition', 'stage', 'screen', 'not', 'script', 'characterizations', 'are', 'DIFFERENT', 'stage', 'play', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'count', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'seen', 'bigger', 'differences', 'one', 'professional', 'production', 'next.Before', 'came', 'out', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'rewatched', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'version', 'tried', 'watch', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'version', 'conclusion', 'reading', 'book', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'backstory', 'so', 'many', 'Dickensian', 'plot', 'twists', 'etc', 'ANYBODY', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'single', 'coherent', 'story', 'thing', 'being', 'ten', 'hours', 'long', 'great', 'praise', 'way', 'question', 'sentence', 'try', 'reading', 'JUST', 'Wikipedia', 'plot', 'summary', 'will', 'leave', 'head', 'spinning', 'out', 'numerous', 'characters', 'whom', 'Hugo', 'gave', 'backstories', 'plot', 'arcs', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'plot', 'twists.I', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'inclusion', 'visual', 'elements', 'were', 'compelling', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'distracting', 'present', 'onstage', 'include', 'decrepit', 'war-memorial', 'elephant', 'Gavroche', 'geometry', 'streets', 'buildings', 'where', 'Enjolras', 'comrades', 'erect', 'barricades', 'bottomless', 'pit', 'sewers', 'nearly', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'Marius', 'lives', 'confluence', 'watersheds', 'Javert', 'leaps', 'ensuring', 'death', 'Other', 'changes', 'folks', 'have', 'found', 'disturbing', 'express', 'spirit', 'book', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'technically', 'book', 'play', 'Javert', 'showing', 'Gavroche', 'honor', 'end', 'Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'director', 'used', 'original', 'scene', 'replace', 'whole', 'somewhat', 'silly', 'chapter', 'Javert', 'growing', 'crisis', 'conscience.The', 'reviewer', 'who', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'played', 'Fantine', 'TOO', 'miserable', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'paid', 'attention', 'title', 'apparently', 'exception', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'seemed', 'hit', 'one', 'emotional', 'note', 'maybe', 'three', 'musical', 'notes', 'entire', 'movie', 'cast', 'was', 'well-chosen', 'brought', 'A-game', 'way', 'only', 'Eponine', 'have', 'ever', 'found', 'truly', 'sympathetic', 'most', 'never', 'get', 'pitiable', 'have', 'chosen', 'complain', 'plot', 'elements', 'seem', 'weak', 'play', 'still', 'seem', 'weak', 'screen', 'such', 'Marius', 'Cosette', 'falling', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Well', 'Heart', 'Full', 'Love', 'not', 'favorite', 'song', 'ever', 'better', 'reading', 'Hugo', 'FOUR', 'chapters', 'why', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'happens', 'Again', 'kudos', 'play', 'movie', 'successfully', 'bridging', 'gap', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'awkward', 'book', 'are', 'play', 'screen.Thanks', 'again', 'musical', 'producers', 'who', 'managed', 'get', 'coherent', 'compelling', 'presentation', 'massive', 'complex', 'sometimes', 'contradictory', 'tome', 'movie', 'producers', 'who', 'managed', 'be', 'as', 'true', 'possible', 'book', 'musical', 'while', 'still', 'making', 'ridiculously', 'good', 'movie', 'Paul', 'Race', 'School', 'Rock']",N/A

This is a film of the novel, using the music from the musical, and butchering almost every song in it.I have no idea how good a film of the novel it is, as I have no interest in the story as such. My interest is in the musical.I own many DVDs which /are/ films of a musical. There are many ways of making a film of a musical, from filming it on stage, to doing it as a film but not straying too far from what was possible on a stage, to rethinking it into a film and doing things impossible on a stage.The main problem here (for most of the songs, that is, the ones that were botched) was that the actors kept trying to express emotion /independently of the songs/ and so did not do the songs properly because they were too emotionally distraught. The whole point of a musical is that the /song/ conveys the emotion, not the actor. The actor's job is to sing.Also, great as she was in /Novocain/ and great as her &#34;all three witches of Endor combined&#34; persona was in the Harry Potter series, Helena Bonham Carter's Madam Thenardier is only the second-worst because Sacha Baron Cohen's Thenardier is, hard as it is to believe, worse.Granted, the film sort of comes together toward the end. One or two of the songs are done right. Javert shows some humanity, which is welcome because nobody else in the film shows much, and the Thenardier's almost work at the wedding. And while it is a pity that their song at the wedding is cut, bowdlerizing lyrics and dropping whole songs or verses to songs is a long-standing tradition in make a film of a musical, and so is regrettable but not really a cause for dislike.",1,This Is Not How a Film is Made of a Musical,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,1712,"['rented', 'RedBox', 'am', 'putting', 'review', 'here', '.This', 'not', 'film', 'musical', 'film', 'novel', 'using', 'music', 'musical', 'butchering', 'almost', 'song', 'it.I', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'novel', 'have', 'interest', 'story', 'such', 'interest', 'musical.I', 'own', 'many', 'DVDs', '/are/', 'films', 'musical', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'making', 'film', 'musical', 'filming', 'stage', 'doing', 'film', 'not', 'straying', 'too', 'far', 'what', 'was', 'possible', 'stage', 'rethinking', 'film', 'doing', 'things', 'impossible', 'stage.The', 'main', 'problem', 'here', 'most', 'songs', 'ones', 'were', 'botched', 'was', 'actors', 'kept', 'trying', 'express', 'emotion', '/independently', 'songs/', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'songs', 'properly', 'were', 'too', 'emotionally', 'distraught', 'whole', 'point', 'musical', '/song/', 'conveys', 'emotion', 'not', 'actor', 'actor', 'job', 'sing.Also', 'great', 'was', '/Novocain/', 'great', '34', 'three', 'witches', 'Endor', 'combined', '34', 'persona', 'was', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Madam', 'Thenardier', 'only', 'second-worst', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Thenardier', 'hard', 'believe', 'worse.Granted', 'film', 'sort', 'together', 'end', 'One', 'two', 'songs', 'are', 'done', 'right', 'Javert', 'humanity', 'welcome', 'nobody', 'else', 'film', 'much', 'Thenardier', 'almost', 'work', 'wedding', 'pity', 'song', 'wedding', 'cut', 'bowdlerizing', 'lyrics', 'dropping', 'whole', 'songs', 'verses', 'songs', 'long-standing', 'tradition', 'make', 'film', 'musical', 'so', 'regrettable', 'not', 'really', 'cause', 'dislike']",N/A

We see a French Warship leaning to one side and at least half a dozen ropes running from it when the scene cuts to prisoners righting the ship and pulling it into dry dock.The singing begins and surprisingly, Hugh Jackman (As Jean ValJean) does a decent job with his vocals and can actually carry a tune, ""Look Down, Look Down"" and a cut to Javert standing on the side of the docking bay starring down at the convicts pulling the boat into the bay.Within Minutes, Javert is up and man, I have to say I am starting to question the casting of Russell Crowe in this part. I cannot tell you what Javert was singing because Crowe's voice was horrible at best and easily the worst in the movie, so bad in fact that I wanted to mute the movie (but, I resisted).The scene finishes with ValJean getting parole for the rest of his life. He served 20 years, 5 of which was for stealing a Loaf of Bread, 15 were for running from the law.Scene 2 is ValJean realizing his past is following him but, he gets taken in by the church, given food, and a bed. He repays them by stealing most of their Silver and is rounded up by the police and returned to the Church where, the priest corroborates ValJean's claim that the Silver was given to him. Later in the scene the priest tells him that his soul was purchased for God by that silver and he is now a changed man. ValJean struggles with the idea that somebody holds that much value in him and uses the Silver goods to start a new life.Without going much further into the story, a whole series of connected events lead up to ValJean taking on a new identity, violating parole, being exposed and adopting a child with whom he takes on the run with him. The whole time is set on a burgeoning Revolution and his whole life is spent running from Javert (maybe if he stopped singing ValJean would have stopped running) and raising his adopted Daughter.The highlight of the movie comes with Fantine's solo (Anne Hathaway) and is really one of the most powerful performances I've ever seen. I honestly believe that Anne Hathaway was feeling very deeply when doing that take as there was a point when she seemed truly distressed and she is easily what put the movie over the top.The lowlight was clearly with the casting and there's no way, I would have even considered casting Sacha Baron Cohen in any role of this nature and yet they did! There was one scene where the Inn keeper was peeing into the wine bottles of his patrons, no joke and it really seemed awkward. Also, as soon as Crowe started singing I would have found a replacement in a hurry!The biggest surprise in the movie, Samantha Banks as Eponine. She has a fantastic voice and really shouldn't have been playing second fiddle to Amanda Seyfried (Cosette) as far as continuity goes.Did I like the movie?

Don't listen to any bad reviews you may hear because this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.I don't want to spend too much time rehashing the plot, but I will say that its a meaningful story of love, sacrifice, redemption, hope, suffering, fighting and dying for what you believe, and having faith in god and the innermost goodness of the human soul. There were many times throughout the movie I cried or teared up. There was only one part I had a hard time watching and it had to do with the harming of a child. Otherwise, the violence and sex was minimal. Also something not everyone will enjoy is the recurring theme of religioun and a person's relationship with god. As other reviewers have said, this is an unashamedly Christian movie. It was something I enjoyed, but may not be up someone elsex 's alley.I thought everyone was very well casted, especially Hugh jackman and Anne Hathaway. They put their heart, soul, and body into this film. The cinematography was wonderful and so was the music. Don't go to this movie expecting it to sound like the Broadway or west end productions. This is completely different from how other musicals have been one and its best to appreciate the hard work the cast and crew broughtntonthe table in this highly successful musical adaptation.The difference between this musical and others is that its purpose is to bring a world of meaning to the viewer. I'm sure that many can relate to the characters, whether its Fantine' a single mother who tries desperately to protect her daughter. Or maybe Eponine whose love for Marius is in vain. Not everyone will like this movie and there are plenty of those who will find something to complain about.

The part of Javert calls for a strong, strident voice with a hard edge to it, and this is one of the reasons why Philip Quast was so good in the role. Crowe has a Crooner&#8217;s voice.By contrast, Hugh Jackman&#8217;s soft voice worked very well for much of the film, and his look at the beginning of the film was disturbingly reminiscent of the psychopath in the film &#8220;Slaughter of the Innocents&#8221;. As Valjean becomes more human, so Jackman&#8217;s soft singing voice suits him better.Whilst the film is different to the stage play and concert versions, with some lyric changes that will jarr with aficionados, and with a little less of the humour, it none-the-less draws the viewer along with a multi-stranded rope of emotion that reaches catharsis in Valjean&#8217;s final scene. The emotional Catharsis of Valjean&#8217;s final scene is made all the more intense for ardent Les Mis fans when the two Valjeans leave together.Anne Hathaway&#8217;s deep, gut-wrenching performance as Fantine is well deserving of the Oscar.Daniel Huttlestone goes a great way to relieving the weight of pathos as the cheeky and plucky mudlark Gavroche.",5,I approached this with trepidation,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,1485,"['somebody', 'who', 'ardent', 'fan', 'stage', 'musical', '10th', 'anniversary', 'concert', 'dvd', 'filmed', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'cinematic', 'rendition', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'have', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'to.Russell', 'Crowe', 'marvellous', 'actor', 'voice', 'curious', 'choice', 'part', 'Inspector', 'Javert', 'voice', 'too', 'soft', 'part', 'Javert', 'strong', 'strident', 'voice', 'hard', 'edge', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'Philip', 'Quast', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'role', 'Crowe', 'Crooner', '8217', 'contrast', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', '8217', 'soft', 'voice', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'much', 'film', 'look', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', 'disturbingly', 'reminiscent', 'psychopath', 'film', '8220', 'Slaughter', 'Innocents', '8221', 'Valjean', 'more', 'human', 'Jackman', '8217', 'soft', 'singing', 'voice', 'suits', 'better.Whilst', 'film', 'different', 'stage', 'play', 'concert', 'versions', 'lyric', 'changes', 'will', 'jarr', 'aficionados', 'little', 'less', 'humour', 'none-the-less', 'viewer', 'multi-stranded', 'rope', 'emotion', 'catharsis', 'Valjean', '8217', 'final', 'scene', 'emotional', 'Catharsis', 'Valjean', '8217', 'final', 'scene', 'made', 'more', 'intense', 'ardent', 'Les', 'Mis', 'fans', 'when', 'two', 'Valjeans', 'leave', 'together.Anne', 'Hathaway', '8217', 's', 'deep', 'gut-wrenching', 'performance', 'Fantine', 'well', 'deserving', 'Oscar.Daniel', 'Huttlestone', 'great', 'way', 'relieving', 'weight', 'pathos', 'cheeky', 'plucky', 'mudlark', 'Gavroche']",N/A

1000542,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B000GAKLZI,Ranny Levy,"[3, 4]","The epic musical Les Miserables tells the story of a man named jean Valjean played by Hugh Jackman set during the dawn of the French revolution. After serving 19 years as a slave because he stole a loaf of bread, he breaks parole and spends years reinventing himself as a new man. Jean is being hunted by officer Javert played by Russell Crowe, who swears he will not rest until Jean is behind bars. While running from Javert, Jean Valjean finds himself caring for a factory workers young daughter, Cosette. The young child changes his life forever.Les Miserables is honestly one of the greatest films I have ever seen. This film is almost three hours long and I still wanted it to go on longer. Les Miserables is a very well known Broadway musical and the film stays so true to the play it is unbelievable. Not a single word is off. However, the one thing that changes for the better is that the movie version makes the story easier to understand and follow. I have been a huge fan of Les Mis for a long time and I know almost every single song by heart. I was trying so hard not to start singing along with the film. The musical score was amazing.The whole film is better than I could have ever hoped for, but seeing this tale up on the big screen is phenomenal! The visuals and special effects are truly breathtaking. It is set in France at the beginning of the French revolution when life for the poor was awful and life for the rich was grand. They capture the hard times of the streets perfectly by using dark colors and wonderful lighting contrasts. I loved seeing the world of Les Mis on a grand scale and exactly as I imagined it.I love this entire movie so much that when it was over I immediately wanted to see it again. I'm definitely going to see it again when it comes out in theaters. I have so many scenes that I love so much, but my favorites are the Lovely Ladies' scene and the Master of the House scene. I like the Lovely Ladies scene because that's where Fantine, Cosette's mother turns to the streets as a home after losing her job at the factory. It is a wonderful musical number and Anne Hathaway's performance is amazing! (Oscar Award for Best Supporting Actress) It is so historically accurate showing how people would do anything to make a quick penny from selling their teeth, to chopping off their hair. It was hard for everyone. I also love the Master of the House scene because it is so hilarious with Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the innkeeper and his wife. They con people into staying the night at their inn, then trick them into never leaving. They are so crafty and hilarious and they rob everyone blind. This scene is so clever and hilarious. Sacha and Helena make an amazing duo.I love all of the characters equally, but I'll only pick a few to talk about. Jean Valjean is a truly amazing character and Hugh Jackman brings him to life so well. Hugh's talents are really shown off during this film and I was very impressed by him. Fantine, played by the remarkable Anne Hathaway is a very memorable character. Anne is perfect as Fantine and this was, in my opinion, her best role. The last character that I really enjoyed is Eponine played by Samantha Barks. Eponine sings all of my favorite Les Mis songs and her incredible duo of A Little Fall of Rain with Eddie Redmayne. A little fun fact is that Samantha Marks played Eponine in the Broadway version of Les Mis.I give Les Miserables 5 out of 5 stars because it is truly the most amazing film I've seen in a long time and it far surpassed my expectations. This film is definitely for ages 13 and up because of the dark period it is set in and the violence and cruelty that occurs. Raven D, KIDS FIRST!

Performances are strong, especially from Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe (I thought his singing was fine).The biggest quibbles I have of the film are over its direction and constant singing. Nearly the entire movie is sung through, which can make for a trying experience, especially during the film's slow spots. As mentioned constantly in the film's press and marketing, the film had the actors singing live on set as the cameras rolled. This works to underlie the emotions of the characters during the big musical numbers, but it works less well for when the actors have to sing their dialogue. It's often tuneless and flat, even from a great singer like Jackman! The film's director Tom Hooper likes to shoot his movies with fish-eye lenses and unconventional framing. Personally, I felt these were often distracting and distasteful, again, especially during the slow moments of the story. As things get going though, they're less of an issue.The movie presents a deeply moving story of one man's journey of redemption, which unfortunately gets sidelined during the second half for a thin and predictable love story. Still, it comes together quite nicely. The last hour or so is terrifically stirring and many of the big musical numbers are well done.Picture quality is solid and the the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 audio is very dynamic. Both accurately reproduce the theatrical experience. Extras aren't plentiful but solid. There's a good hour-long documentary, an additional featurette on Hugo's original novel, and a commentary from the director which I chose not to listen to.

DelParto ""Rose2""","[3, 3]","Les Miserables 2012 has to be the most extremely riveting film adaptation of the most revered Broadway shows and novels to be produced thus far.  With an all-star ensemble cast, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried, Helena Bonham Carter, and Sascha Cohen, Director Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech"") has recreated the classic semi-operatic musical including its most trademark songs ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" ""Who Am I"" and ""One Day More.""  When first glancing at the first few musical numbers, one may not help but to compare this film to other musicals that have been set onto film, ""Phantom of the Opera,"" ""The Wiz,"" or ""Chicago.""  But if one delves into the genre even deeper, the film may also have parallels to movie musicals, such as ""Oliver,"" ""Tommy,"" or ""Moulin Rouge"" because the actors are actually singing out their lines within the film that fittingly is well done.  However, a line is drawn, especially with this version of Les Miserables that specifically stands alone from the rest and outshines as well.The film contains an intense depiction of each of the main characters with fierce dramatic emotion and romance.  But the undeniable highlight of the film is the music itself that is performed by the actors that display their musical dexterity and experience that may most likely move the viewer; a reminder that music can easily translate to various interpretations especially if it is carefully selected and exceptionally played.  And within the first hour of the film, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) and Fantine (Anne Hathaway) are pure examples of how music may move an individual as well as the rest of the actors that are playing their part in exemplifying the major themes expressed within the storyline and the film; it is a storyline the weaves a tale of characters longing for a purpose that leads each into situations that tests their souls and progresses within almost a ten year span that begins with Jean Valjean and Fantine and the introduction of Fantine's daughter Cossette (younger Isabelle Allen and older Amanda Seyfried) that show the power and struggle of secrets buried and eventual truths foretold within a historic backdrop that takes place in France during a time of oppression and revolution of the mid-nineteenth century.  It is an epic film of cinematographic proportions from the hilly and coastal cloistered landscape to the dingy cityscape of bottom dwellers Monsieur (Sascha Cohen) and Madame Thenadier (Helena Bonham Carter) and antagonists such as Constable Javert (Russell Crowe) and romantics Marius (Eddie Redmayne) and Eponine (Samantha Barks) attempting to survive that looks a little like a Dickens novel of Tales of Two Cities that ring out the lines of ""it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.""  However, that quote was not even mentioned in the film but as one may watch, it connotes that thought in mind.  But aside from the parallels, the costumes and swagger of each of the actors bring the period alive.Les Miserables and its entire cast and crew are well deserving of all of the accolades and standing performances or at least hand claps at the end of the film.  They have shown that the sheer beauty of song and Victor Hugo's story has left a lasting impression upon audiences, and most importantly through music.",5,Magnificent and Epic,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,3308,"['Les', 'Miserables', '2012', 'be', 'most', 'extremely', 'riveting', 'film', 'adaptation', 'most', 'revered', 'Broadway', 'shows', 'novels', 'be', 'produced', 'thus', 'far', 'all-star', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Sascha', 'Cohen', 'Director', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'King', 'Speech', 'recreated', 'classic', 'semi-operatic', 'musical', 'including', 'most', 'trademark', 'songs', 'Dreamed', 'Dream', 'Who', 'Am', 'One', 'Day', 'More', 'When', 'first', 'glancing', 'first', 'few', 'musical', 'numbers', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'help', 'compare', 'film', 'other', 'musicals', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'film', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Wiz', 'Chicago', 'one', 'genre', 'even', 'deeper', 'film', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'parallels', 'movie', 'musicals', 'such', 'Oliver', 'Tommy', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'actors', 'are', 'actually', 'singing', 'out', 'lines', 'film', 'fittingly', 'well', 'done', 'However', 'line', 'drawn', 'especially', 'version', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'specifically', 'alone', 'rest', 'outshines', 'well.The', 'film', 'intense', 'depiction', 'main', 'characters', 'fierce', 'dramatic', 'emotion', 'romance', 'undeniable', 'highlight', 'film', 'music', 'performed', 'actors', 'display', 'musical', 'dexterity', 'experience', 'may', 'most', 'likely', 'move', 'viewer', 'reminder', 'music', 'can', 'easily', 'translate', 'various', 'interpretations', 'especially', 'carefully', 'selected', 'exceptionally', 'played', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Fantine', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'are', 'pure', 'examples', 'how', 'music', 'may', 'move', 'individual', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'actors', 'are', 'playing', 'part', 'exemplifying', 'major', 'themes', 'expressed', 'storyline', 'film', 'storyline', 'weaves', 'tale', 'characters', 'longing', 'purpose', 'situations', 'tests', 'souls', 'progresses', 'almost', 'ten', 'year', 'span', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'Fantine', 'introduction', 'Fantine', 'daughter', 'Cossette', 'younger', 'Isabelle', 'Allen', 'older', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'show', 'power', 'struggle', 'secrets', 'buried', 'eventual', 'truths', 'foretold', 'historic', 'backdrop', 'place', 'France', 'time', 'oppression', 'revolution', 'mid-nineteenth', 'century', 'epic', 'film', 'cinematographic', 'proportions', 'hilly', 'coastal', 'cloistered', 'landscape', 'dingy', 'cityscape', 'bottom', 'dwellers', 'Monsieur', 'Sascha', 'Cohen', 'Madame', 'Thenadier', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'antagonists', 'such', 'Constable', 'Javert', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'romantics', 'Marius', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'Eponine', 'Samantha', 'Barks', 'attempting', 'survive', 'little', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'Tales', 'Two', 'Cities', 'ring', 'out', 'lines', 'was', 'best', 'times', 'was', 'worst', 'times', 'However', 'quote', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'film', 'one', 'may', 'watch', 'thought', 'mind', 'aside', 'parallels', 'costumes', 'swagger', 'actors', 'bring', 'period', 'alive.Les', 'Miserables', 'entire', 'cast', 'crew', 'are', 'well', 'deserving', 'accolades', 'standing', 'performances', 'least', 'hand', 'claps', 'end', 'film', 'have', 'shown', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'song', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'story', 'left', 'lasting', 'impression', 'audiences', 'most', 'importantly', 'music']",N/A

This movie conveys the story well, and you should enjoy watching some of your favorite actors in a high-budget film.Now, for those of you who are Les Miserables gourmets, there are certainly things in this version that fall far short of perfection -- especially musically.  If you are a singer or a musician, please don't watch this!  You might experience physical pain as you listen to the marginal singers.  Russell Crowe, as Javert, was a particular disappointment; Cosette and Marius duets often bordered on laughable; and the innkeepers' scenes were abrasive.If, however, you aren't so musically picky, you might want to give this incarnation of Victor Hugo's novel a chance.  Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway portrayed ValJean and Fontine with their whole heart and soul.  While I'm not 100% endorsing this film, I am 100% in approval of Anne Hathaway's Best Actress award.

1000549,ASHQAHLZ5QH43,B000GAKLZI,Rebecca Roztocil,"[0, 0]","I was very impressed with the vocal talents of some of the actors in this movie.  I adore the musical and this novel is my absolute favorite.  I've read it twice.  The reason I did not give it five stars is this: the musical is best viewed as a stage performance.  Trying to put a work of this scope into a movie format, and squeeze it into even two hours is just not enough.  If you are going to put it on film, then you need to make it in several parts and cover it as close to the original novel as possible.  Otherwise, casual viewers will not (and did not in the case of my family) understand what was going on, and how very significant EVERYTHING was to the time the story was written.

A historical drama set to music...a musical dialogue of historical proportions. Adapted from a stage musical of Victor Hugo's 1862 novel of the same name. Beginning in 1815, 20 years after the French Revolution, and culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, the novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, focusing on the struggles of ex-convict, Jean Valjean, and his experience of redemption. The French were never very successful, at least during this period, in making revolution work; and the French people in the main were indeed poor, miserable, and wretched. Unlike other adaptations of Hugo's classic novel - and there are several excellent ones - the dialogue is set to music and the characters sing their lines. Hugh Jackman, as Jean Valjean, delivers a masterful performance, but dramatically and musically...he has a wonderful singing voice. The other main character, Javert, the police inspector, who pursues Valjean throughout the film, is played by Russell Crowe. Crowe also does well dramatically, but his singing voice is frankly less than adequate...but thankfully not so much as to detract from the overall quality of the film. Crowe and Jackman are the two stars, but the second most powerful performance in this film is by Anne Hathaway as Fantine...and can she ever sing. The balance of the featured characters are also perfectly cast, w/Eddie Redmayne as the revolutionary, Marius Pontmercy, who falls in love w/Cosette, played by Amanda Seyfried; and Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen, as the Th&eacute;nardiers, two swindling innkeepers...Samantha Barks, in her film debut, plays Eponine, their daughter.

I prefer the sparseness and darkness of the stage arrangements on Broadway, rather than the poorly crafted first few minutes, or the overly-colorful scenes of outside monastery. Things that worked well in the understated format of the stage just seem too grandiose in this film. It's just a matter of preference. Both can exist and do. I do feel sorry, however, for those who didn't see the stage version first.It was nice to see the original Jean Valjean playing the abbot! Without him the musical may have never been a success at all.I recommend at least listening to the original Broadway recording on CD before watching the film. The story is totally self-explanatory, and though the book is a huge hefty thing filled with philosophical asides and essays, that might be a good idea for some.I have to say: Hugh Jackman had scared me as a choice for this, because his work as Curly in Oklahoma was so lackluster (and I LOVE Hugh)...but his performance in Les Mis is sterling. Anne Hathaway is gifted and always has been, as a singer, and she did a swell job. Fantine is sometimes a sidenote in the stage version (and afterthought) and she was given the best female role (or in my opinion, she and her director made it into the best role). The young couple was adorable, and the young man/love interest was a great surprise to see, as I had adored him in Pillars of the Earth and Tess of the D'Urbervilles (BBC). We had no idea he sang so well. The young lady who played Eponine was so professional that it almost didn't suit her. She would be a much better live performer...oddly enough. I felt she emoted in a stage style rather than for a good close-up film performance. If you did watch the Academy Awards performance by the cast, she was the best part...and she had the chops and training and poise to sing live that the others didn't have. Many, I'm sure will be dismally disappointed by Russell Crowe's performance as Javert, as was I, but I knew beforehand that he wasn't a singer by any means. I felt mad that he had not been able to turn the role down, most likely. Who could, really? Javert is fascinating and the baritone/bass up to tenor range makes it the most challenging singing in the entire musical. I doubt any actor in Hollywood could have done it well. However, to point out his acting chops: even though he seemed far too depressed and worried about his singing to come across as a good Javert, he did have moments where he emoted the conflict within Javert better than anybody probably ever has. At moments in the barricade scenes, he defined what Victor Hugo was reaching for, and the role took on a 3-dimensional quality that you would never get on stage. The gray areas of Javert and his self-loathing for where he came from are very clear at moments, and I have to applaud Crowe for his acting abilities, given the setbacks. Just remember that Hollywood and British actors have all ruined well-loved musicals callously in the past: Richard Harris as Arthur in the film of Camelot, Vanessa Redgrave in the film of Camelot (who replaced Julie Andrews from the stage version), Even those actresses and actors who have had another voice dubbed-in for them have been very disappointing in the past: Natalie Wood's substitute in Westside Story, or Audrey Hepburn's part-time substitute in My Fair Lady (which also had belonged to Julie Andrews on stage)...even they were pretty lackluster and the director's could have had the pick of the litter instead.Overall, if you aren't hypercritical, I'd say this was better than I'd ever expected....and I'm a meanie.",4,Better than I expected it would be,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,3668,"['singers', 'approach', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'irksome', 'prefer', 'sparseness', 'darkness', 'stage', 'arrangements', 'Broadway', 'rather', 'poorly', 'crafted', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'overly-colorful', 'scenes', 'outside', 'monastery', 'Things', 'worked', 'well', 'understated', 'format', 'stage', 'just', 'seem', 'too', 'grandiose', 'film', 'just', 'matter', 'preference', 'can', 'exist', 'do', 'do', 'feel', 'sorry', 'however', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'stage', 'version', 'first.It', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'original', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'playing', 'abbot', 'musical', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'success', 'all.I', 'recommend', 'least', 'listening', 'original', 'Broadway', 'recording', 'CD', 'watching', 'film', 'story', 'totally', 'self-explanatory', 'book', 'huge', 'hefty', 'thing', 'filled', 'philosophical', 'asides', 'essays', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'some.I', 'have', 'say', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'had', 'scared', 'choice', 'work', 'Curly', 'Oklahoma', 'was', 'so', 'lackluster', 'LOVE', 'Hugh', 'performance', 'Les', 'Mis', 'sterling', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'gifted', 'always', 'been', 'singer', 'did', 'swell', 'job', 'Fantine', 'sometimes', 'sidenote', 'stage', 'version', 'afterthought', 'was', 'given', 'best', 'female', 'role', 'opinion', 'director', 'made', 'best', 'role', 'young', 'couple', 'was', 'adorable', 'young', 'man/love', 'interest', 'was', 'great', 'surprise', 'see', 'had', 'adored', 'Pillars', 'Earth', 'Tess', ""D'Urbervilles"", 'BBC', 'had', 'idea', 'sang', 'so', 'well', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'played', 'Eponine', 'was', 'so', 'professional', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'suit', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'live', 'performer', 'oddly', 'enough', 'felt', 'emoted', 'stage', 'style', 'rather', 'good', 'close-up', 'film', 'performance', 'did', 'watch', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'performance', 'cast', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'had', 'chops', 'training', 'poise', 'sing', 'live', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Many', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'dismally', 'disappointed', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'performance', 'Javert', 'was', 'knew', 'beforehand', 'was', ""n't"", 'singer', 'means', 'felt', 'mad', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'turn', 'role', 'down', 'most', 'likely', 'Who', 'could', 'really', 'Javert', 'fascinating', 'baritone/bass', 'up', 'tenor', 'range', 'most', 'challenging', 'singing', 'entire', 'musical', 'doubt', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'However', 'point', 'out', 'acting', 'chops', 'even', 'seemed', 'far', 'too', 'depressed', 'worried', 'singing', 'come', 'good', 'Javert', 'did', 'have', 'moments', 'where', 'emoted', 'conflict', 'Javert', 'better', 'anybody', 'probably', 'ever', 'moments', 'barricade', 'scenes', 'defined', 'what', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'was', 'reaching', 'role', 'took', '3-dimensional', 'quality', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'stage', 'gray', 'areas', 'Javert', 'self-loathing', 'where', 'came', 'are', 'very', 'clear', 'moments', 'have', 'applaud', 'Crowe', 'acting', 'abilities', 'given', 'setbacks', 'Just', 'remember', 'Hollywood', 'British', 'actors', 'have', 'ruined', 'well-loved', 'musicals', 'callously', 'past', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Arthur', 'film', 'Camelot', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'film', 'Camelot', 'who', 'replaced', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'stage', 'version', 'Even', 'actresses', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'voice', 'dubbed-in', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'disappointing', 'past', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'substitute', 'Westside', 'Story', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'part-time', 'substitute', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'also', 'had', 'belonged', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'stage', 'even', 'were', 'pretty', 'lackluster', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'pick', 'litter', 'instead.Overall', 'are', ""n't"", 'hypercritical', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'better', ""'d"", 'ever', 'expected', '.and', ""'m"", 'meanie']",N/A

The dialogue is all sung with reoccurring musical themes.  But most of the songs are beautiful. The only part that fell short was first of all, Crowe singing the part of Javert.  Javert has two powerful songs that usually garners standing ovations.  Crowe's voice could not handle them and he gave the impression he wished he wasn't there.  Sad when there were so many Broadway singers that do that part so well.  This is a piece of history with the plot kind of squished together so you get the feel of the era and the injustice of it all.  It moves toward quite an emotional ending.  However the ending was not as powerful as it should have been because I think the directors were afraid of backlash from non-religious people.  They dumbed down the ending and therefore dumbed down the hope that you were supposed to be left with.

It's the official film adaptation of the West End/Broadway musical Les Miserables (which is an adaptation of the French musical of the same name, which is based on the Victor Hugo classic - Whew).The Good- Ann Hathaway - Fantine is important, although she is relegated to being a medium character in the musical as far as stage/screen time goes.  She does as well as you can expect.- Russel Crowe - Probably the most controversial choice in the casting of the movie, I think he does a fine job.  I think he plays Javert a bit more introspectively than the inspector is usually played.  His singing is good (not great, but good.  I think those that listened to the cast recording are the reason we get that he sings so badly in Les Miserables.  On the cast recording, he is dreadful.  In the film, he is good.).  He's not Quast, but he really fills out a uniform!- Aaron Tevit - Maybe the best Enjolras I've seen.  Yummy to look at and just the right amount of intensity.- Daniel Huttlestone - A pretty good Gavroche.- Eddie Redmayne - I was leaning the other way until ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.""  To be honest, his voice sounded like a goose's honk up 'til this.  Then he cuts loose and wins me over.The bad- Hugh Jackman - Pretty much every reason that Crowe works as Javert is why Jackman doesn't work as Jean Valjean.  He was pretty much wrong from the start,  It's pretty interesting to say that the lead in a movie is bad when the movie turns out pretty good, but then again it is Les Miserables.- The cinematography - It's not that it is all bad, but it's so hit and miss as to be a distraction.All-in-all, it's a good movie (hence the 4 stars), but it could have been great.",4,Better and worse than we should have expected.,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,1746,"['not', 'bad', 'movie', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'official', 'film', 'adaptation', 'West', 'End/Broadway', 'musical', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'adaptation', 'French', 'musical', 'same', 'name', 'based', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'classic', 'Whew', 'Good-', 'Ann', 'Hathaway', 'Fantine', 'important', 'relegated', 'being', 'medium', 'character', 'musical', 'as', 'far', 'stage/screen', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'expect.-', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'Probably', 'most', 'controversial', 'choice', 'casting', 'movie', 'think', 'fine', 'job', 'think', 'Javert', 'bit', 'more', 'introspectively', 'inspector', 'usually', 'played', 'singing', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'think', 'listened', 'cast', 'recording', 'are', 'reason', 'get', 'so', 'badly', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'cast', 'recording', 'dreadful', 'film', 'good.', 'not', 'Quast', 'really', 'out', 'uniform', 'Aaron', 'Tevit', 'Maybe', 'best', 'Enjolras', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Yummy', 'look', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'intensity.-', 'Daniel', 'Huttlestone', 'pretty', 'good', 'Gavroche.-', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'was', 'leaning', 'other', 'way', 'Empty', 'Chairs', 'Empty', 'Tables', 'be', 'honest', 'voice', 'sounded', 'goose', 'honk', 'up', ""'til"", 'Then', 'loose', 'bad-', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Pretty', 'much', 'reason', 'Crowe', 'Javert', 'why', 'Jackman', ""n't"", 'work', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'start', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'say', 'lead', 'movie', 'bad', 'when', 'movie', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'then', 'again', 'Les', 'Miserables.-', 'cinematography', 'not', 'bad', 'so', 'hit', 'miss', 'be', 'distraction.All-in-all', 'good', 'movie', 'hence', '4', 'stars', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great']",N/A

It wouldn't have been this way if the worthy project had been given to a different director.The original stage musical has been justifiably loved by many and won many awards in its various languages. Though flawed by its paucity of melodic creativity (there seems to be one song that keeps reappearing throughout with small variations) and a tendency toward over-bloating the material (Javert dies not from an ignominious death in a canal but a leap from a height that rivals the top of Mount Everest), the original musical was a masterpiece of adaptation from the Victor Hugo novel.The movie captures that accurately and perhaps beautifully but the beloved property has been undermined and eventually destroyed by the most incoherent and pedestrian film direction I've witnessed in at least a decade. In short, the film is a mess due to Tom Hooper's insistence of dizzying, relentless close-ups of grotesque singing faces spasmodically darting about, and his total inability to place two or three people into an organized and meaningful composed shot. Establishing shots are completely absent, and no attention seems paid to any visual relationships between characters, the organizing of which is a prerequisite for any director.One searches in vain for any intelligent use of space here, as Hooper haphazardly frames faces off-center, too high or too low, as if a child or a disabled grandparent inadvertently picked up the camera and aimed it without being able to see its image through the viewfinder.In the hands of a competent director a simple conversation (or a duet) between two lovers can be a thing of significance and beauty in which we experience one lover declaring love at the same time we experience the reactions of the other lover simply listening, but here all we get is one face at a time repeatedly shoved into our mugs in an assault as if an out-of-control jack-in-the-box puppet is out to get us. This is no way to convey the subtlety or sensitivity of a marvelous property like this epic musical. It only remains to see if the aficionados of the original have the good sense (and the imagination) to realize what this film could have been -- and how much they've been short-changed as well as dishonored.Sorry this functions as a mere footnote, but a word needs to be said about the singing. In essence, some are inadequate for the task (Crowe's weakness bothers me less than Jackman's irritatingly uncontrollable vibrato) but a few are marvelous (like Samantha Barks and David Heddlestone). However, it is truly Anne Hathaway's earnestness and heart-felt singing that towers over the rest of the movie and will surely garner her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.And in the future I can only hope that any project I value doesn't fall into the bungling hands of Mr. Hooper!",1,"I felt as if I were one of ""Les Miserables""!",1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,2934,"['Tom', 'Hooper', 'movie', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'far', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'year', 'fact', 'one', 'year', 'worst', 'films', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'way', 'worthy', 'project', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'different', 'director.The', 'original', 'stage', 'musical', 'been', 'justifiably', 'loved', 'many', 'won', 'many', 'awards', 'various', 'languages', 'flawed', 'paucity', 'melodic', 'creativity', 'there', 'be', 'one', 'song', 'reappearing', 'small', 'variations', 'tendency', 'over-bloating', 'material', 'Javert', 'not', 'ignominious', 'death', 'canal', 'leap', 'height', 'top', 'Mount', 'Everest', 'original', 'musical', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'adaptation', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'novel.The', 'movie', 'captures', 'accurately', 'perhaps', 'beautifully', 'beloved', 'property', 'been', 'undermined', 'eventually', 'destroyed', 'most', 'incoherent', 'pedestrian', 'film', 'direction', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'least', 'decade', 'short', 'film', 'mess', 'due', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'insistence', 'dizzying', 'relentless', 'close-ups', 'grotesque', 'singing', 'spasmodically', 'darting', 'total', 'inability', 'place', 'two', 'three', 'people', 'organized', 'meaningful', 'composed', 'shot', 'Establishing', 'shots', 'are', 'completely', 'absent', 'attention', 'paid', 'visual', 'relationships', 'characters', 'organizing', 'prerequisite', 'director.One', 'searches', 'vain', 'intelligent', 'use', 'space', 'here', 'Hooper', 'haphazardly', 'off-center', 'too', 'high', 'too', 'low', 'child', 'disabled', 'grandparent', 'inadvertently', 'picked', 'up', 'camera', 'aimed', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'image', 'viewfinder.In', 'hands', 'competent', 'director', 'simple', 'conversation', 'duet', 'two', 'lovers', 'can', 'be', 'thing', 'significance', 'beauty', 'experience', 'one', 'lover', 'declaring', 'love', 'same', 'time', 'experience', 'reactions', 'other', 'lover', 'simply', 'listening', 'here', 'get', 'one', 'face', 'time', 'repeatedly', 'shoved', 'mugs', 'assault', 'out-of-control', 'jack-in-the-box', 'puppet', 'out', 'get', 'way', 'convey', 'subtlety', 'sensitivity', 'marvelous', 'property', 'epic', 'musical', 'only', 'see', 'aficionados', 'original', 'have', 'good', 'sense', 'imagination', 'realize', 'what', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'how', 'much', ""'ve"", 'been', 'short-changed', 'as', 'well', 'dishonored.Sorry', 'functions', 'mere', 'footnote', 'word', 'be', 'said', 'singing', 'essence', 'are', 'inadequate', 'task', 'Crowe', 'weakness', 'bothers', 'less', 'Jackman', 'irritatingly', 'uncontrollable', 'vibrato', 'few', 'are', 'marvelous', 'Samantha', 'Barks', 'David', 'Heddlestone', 'However', 'truly', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'earnestness', 'heart-felt', 'singing', 'towers', 'rest', 'movie', 'will', 'surely', 'garner', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress.And', 'future', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'project', 'value', ""n't"", 'fall', 'bungling', 'hands', 'Mr.', 'Hooper']",N/A

I would have hoped that Les Miserables would be ONE beloved production that Hollywood could not completely destroy. I stand corrected. The singing styles combined with the acting -- an obvious product of horrific direction -- were awkward at best. Anyone who claimed that Hugh Jackman or Russell Crowe could sing is deluded to the point of needing medication. And anyone who claimed Anne Hathaway turned-in an Oscar-worthy performance wouldn't know a good actor if he/she slapped them in the face.Basically what you have in this rendition of the beloved musical, is a clunky, cringe-inducing half-measure that the Hollywood moguls actually managed to buttress with their last bastion of imagination: special effects. That's correct. They actually managed to pack this turd of a film with CGI special effects. Funny how the Geoffrey Rush/Liam Neeson version relied on terrific acting and an honest interpretation of Victor Hugo's book rather than flimsy computer effects. This musical (if you want to actually call it that) couldn't even manage to contain itself and stay somewhat honest to the stage production's already emotion-packed, heart wrenching story.Mind you, I've seen Les Miserables on and off Broadway and I can attest that this latest version is a sour attempt that was then propagated as some award-worthy film by the Oscar-voting crowd.

1000582,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000GAKLZI,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 4]","****1/2The long-delayed movie version of the stage musical &#8220;Les Miserables&#8221; has finally arrived - and the good news is that it is well worth the wait.  For the film harkens back to those glory days when musicals were massively-scaled, big-time events, and when all involved in their making wore their hearts unashamedly on their sleeves for all to see.&#8220;Les Miz&#8221; is, of course, based on the beloved Victor Hugo novel about the hardened convict, Jean Valjean, who devotes his life to helping others after a kind bishop shows him compassion and forgiveness at the darkest moment of his life. Through the course of the story, Valjean touches the lives of many people, but none so significantly as those of Fantine, the waiflike prostitute who has fallen on desperate times, and her daughter Cosette, whom Valjean dedicates his life to raising after her mother&#8216;s death.  Valjean&#8217;s main antagonist is Inspector Javert, an unyielding stickler for the law who has made it his life&#8217;s mission to bring what he sees as a flagrant lawbreaker to justice, unmoved by all the good Valjean has done.With its vast array of larger-than-life figures, its melodramatic plotting, romantic flourishes and great themes of legal vs. natural law and the possibility of personal redemption - all set against the backdrop of sweeping social injustice in 19th Century France -&#8220;Les Miz&#8221; was obviously ideal material for composer Claude-Michel Schonberg and lyricist Alain Boublil ( with English translation by Herbert Kretzmer) to work with. In fact, so rich is the vein they&#8217;re mining here that &#8220;Les Miz&#8221; is closer to operetta than it is to those musicals of a bygone era, with very little spoken dialogue throughout the course of the movie. And this brings us to one of the minor quibbles I have with the film and with the show as a whole.For if there is a weakness to the film, it is probably the result of two factors: the inevitable difficulties inherent in trying to cram a 1200-page novel into a two-and-a-half-hour film, and the fact that the movie is entirely sung. The result of both of these limitations is that we lose some of the connective tissue that provides the characters&#8217; motivations.  The story tends to move in fits and starts and lacks the cohesive flow that at least some dialogue might have provided. The constant singing also prevents the characters from engaging one another in conversation, which would help to clarify some of the finer details of the plot.  For instance, we don&#8217;t get a sense of why Valjean is so beloved as mayor of his town (he showed them how to manufacture jewelry more quickly and economically, thereby saving the community from ruin). We&#8217;re also deprived of the intense back-and-forth struggle between Valjean and Javert for Fantine&#8217;s soul.  Moreover, Valjean&#8217;s moment of great self-sacrifice, when he turns himself into the court to save the man falsely accused of being him, goes by so fast that many people, unfamiliar with the story, may not even understand fully what&#8217;s going on there.  Even worse, Cosette and Marius, the impulsive revolutionary who becomes the young girl&#8217;s love interest, aren&#8217;t even allowed a moment of communication before they&#8217;re pledging undying devotion to one another in verse.Yet, even with these flaws, &#8220;Les Miz&#8221; is a tremendously  moving and uplifting experience, unabashed in its sentimentality.  Much has been made of the fact that the singing was recorded live on set, a breakthrough that does indeed add a quality of immediacy to the production, even if the soundtrack will probably suffer in comparison to one of the many stage recordings that have been released over the decades.  Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway do a particularly fine job in the singing department, with only Russell Crowe as Javert failing to rise to the challenge to any appreciable extent. And there are many scenes, particularly in the second half, that are positively transporting: a poignant Hathaway nailing &#8220;I Dreamed a Dream,&#8221; Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne singing &#8220;In My Life,&#8221; Samantha Banks as Eponine performing &#8220;On My Own,&#8221; Redmayne singing the heartbreaking &#8220;Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,&#8221; the whole cast joining in on &#8220;One Day More&#8221; (the show&#8217;s homage to &#8220;The Quintet&#8221; from &#8220;West Side Story&#8221;), and the chorus performing the majestic &#8220;Do You Hear the People Sing?&#8221; which can&#8217;t help but lift your heart into your throat. And indeed your heart will be lodged there through significant portions of this movie.Tom Hooper (&#8220;The King&#8217;s Speech&#8221;) has directed the film largely as a succession of close-ups, which does deprive us of a sense of spatial geography from time to time but which helps to enhance the operatic nature of the piece.  And, oddly for a musical, there is no choreography to speak of, just as there wasn&#8217;t in the stage production.  For compensation, we have Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter having the time of their professional lives portraying the campy, comic-relief villains, the Thenardiers.Let&#8217;s just hope that the making of &#8220;Les Miserables,&#8221; and the audience&#8217;s obvious appreciation of it, will finally bring back the old-fashioned movie musical.

1000602,A2Z4NPJ1WAWDE7,B000GAKLZI,R. Zoellner,"[0, 0]","Imagine the scene:  A father has just accidentally intercepted a love note addressed to his only child, a daughter.  This letter reveals several facts:  The two have only met once.  She has given the young man a note confessing her love, and tell him she and her father are leaving the country.  The final fact?  The young man is currently involved in a rebellion against the government which he does not expect to survive.  Were this a scene in any other movie or TV drama I've ever seen except Les Miserables, this father would have surely said something like ""Well, that's that, and she'd better get over him as quickly as she fell for him,"" before destroying the letter.  But this scene is from Les Miserables, which means something far more surprising happens instead.  More than almost anything else, Les Mis as it is called in short form, is a story about the conflict between justice and mercy.It is called Les Miserables, of course, because it primarily focuses on the miserable people.  This is a story about the oppressed, downtrodden, from whom hope has been stolen.  Characters sing, yes, but about things like being a slave, or feeling as though they are standing in their graves.  The world of this musical is harsh and unforgiving.  Each character faces despair, but none so thoroughly as Fantine, who, according to Anne Hathaway who played her, is the most miserable.  We see her life as a terrible downslide, with no kindness shown to her till it is far too late.  But of course, she is not the only outstanding character, or actor in the film.  Les Mis is an extravagant production, led by the always impressive Hugh Jackman, and including some very well cast and talented newcomers to my knowledge.  The scene, costumes, and singing are all brilliantly done, and the special features nicely add to my appreciation of these elements.  They also made me want to go and read the original novel by Victor Hugo.  Every member of this production who spoke waxed eloquent on how it was the true source of all this brilliance.They did not, however, talk about the unique method this filming of Les Miserables used for recording the singing, which I had heard about from other sources.  So as much as I recommend this movie, I also suggest getting whatever is the most deluxe edition available.  This is a movie for the ages, with perennial themes of justice, love, kindness, mercy, oppression, despair, crime, rebellion, and Hugh Jackman's incredible physical strength.  A true must-see, especially for the themes of grace and redemption.",5,Even better the second time I watched !,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,2550,"['Imagine', 'scene', 'father', 'just', 'accidentally', 'intercepted', 'love', 'note', 'addressed', 'only', 'child', 'daughter', 'letter', 'several', 'facts', 'two', 'have', 'only', 'met', 'once', 'given', 'young', 'man', 'note', 'confessing', 'love', 'tell', 'father', 'are', 'leaving', 'country', 'final', 'fact', 'young', 'man', 'currently', 'involved', 'rebellion', 'government', 'not', 'expect', 'survive', 'Were', 'scene', 'other', 'movie', 'TV', 'drama', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'father', 'would', 'have', 'surely', 'said', 'something', 'Well', ""'d"", 'better', 'get', 'over', 'as', 'quickly', 'fell', 'destroying', 'letter', 'scene', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'surprising', 'happens', 'instead', 'More', 'almost', 'anything', 'else', 'Les', 'Mis', 'called', 'short', 'form', 'story', 'conflict', 'justice', 'mercy.It', 'called', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'course', 'primarily', 'miserable', 'people', 'story', 'oppressed', 'downtrodden', 'whom', 'hope', 'been', 'stolen', 'Characters', 'sing', 'yes', 'things', 'being', 'slave', 'feeling', 'are', 'standing', 'graves', 'world', 'musical', 'harsh', 'unforgiving', 'character', 'despair', 'none', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'Fantine', 'who', 'according', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'played', 'most', 'miserable', 'see', 'life', 'terrible', 'downslide', 'kindness', 'shown', 'till', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'course', 'not', 'only', 'outstanding', 'character', 'actor', 'film', 'Les', 'Mis', 'extravagant', 'production', 'led', 'always', 'impressive', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'including', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'talented', 'newcomers', 'knowledge', 'scene', 'costumes', 'singing', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'special', 'features', 'nicely', 'add', 'appreciation', 'elements', 'also', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'read', 'original', 'novel', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'Every', 'member', 'production', 'who', 'spoke', 'waxed', 'eloquent', 'how', 'was', 'true', 'source', 'brilliance.They', 'did', 'not', 'however', 'talk', 'unique', 'method', 'filming', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'used', 'recording', 'singing', 'had', 'heard', 'other', 'sources', 'So', 'as', 'much', 'recommend', 'movie', 'also', 'suggest', 'getting', 'most', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'available', 'movie', 'ages', 'perennial', 'themes', 'justice', 'love', 'kindness', 'mercy', 'oppression', 'despair', 'crime', 'rebellion', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'incredible', 'physical', 'strength', 'true', 'must-see', 'especially', 'themes', 'grace', 'redemption']",N/A

Les Mis has been around since 1985 and the fact that not only it, but many musicals written since the 70's, are sung all the way through is not news.  All of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals are, certainly, and Les Mis, with great acclaim, jumped into the midst of all that modern musical theater and has literally held up it's flag proudly all along.Les Mis is a classic story of a man's spiritual journey from being a bitter, resentful man who has not hope, to one who follows God and therefore changes many people lives for the better as their own lives intersect with his, except for Inpector Javert who, even though he does see the goodness of Jean Valjean, can't deal with it and makes his own life-altering choices.Is the movie all that it could be?  Probably not on all levels, but it really gets close.  Hugh Jackman has a long history with stage musicals and does a fine job.  Russell Crowe's singing is a bit lacking, especially comparing him with Philip Quast, the greatest Javert ever, but he does well enough.  Anne Hathaway's up-close interpretation is more emotionally intense than Patti Lu Pone's, but it works.  Amanda Seyfried does hit all the operatic Cossette notes, not with the skill of other Cossettes, but she does it.  Samantha Barks as Eponine hits a home run and why wouldn't she with her background.  Eddie Redmaine may be no Michael Ball, but he is a sympathetic Marius and he and Amanda do make a good couple.This is a great movie, it's great to have it on screen, and most who are familiar with the original stage presentation should be happy.For those out there who still don't like the ""sung-all-the-way-through"" aspect of Les Mis, you should probably be seeking out non-musical movies and plays in the first place.",5,Les Miserables: finally on screen,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,1898,"['amazing', 'many', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'reflected', 'feelings', 'here', 'seemed', 'surprised', 'seeing', 'movie', 'sung', 'way', 'Les', 'Mis', 'been', '1985', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'many', 'musicals', 'written', '70', 'are', 'sung', 'way', 'not', 'news', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'musicals', 'are', 'certainly', 'Les', 'Mis', 'great', 'acclaim', 'jumped', 'midst', 'modern', 'musical', 'theater', 'literally', 'held', 'up', 'flag', 'proudly', 'along.Les', 'Mis', 'classic', 'story', 'man', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'being', 'bitter', 'resentful', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'hope', 'one', 'who', 'God', 'therefore', 'changes', 'many', 'people', 'lives', 'better', 'own', 'lives', 'intersect', 'Inpector', 'Javert', 'who', 'even', 'see', 'goodness', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'own', 'life-altering', 'choices.Is', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'Probably', 'not', 'levels', 'really', 'close', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'long', 'history', 'stage', 'musicals', 'fine', 'job', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'singing', 'bit', 'lacking', 'especially', 'comparing', 'Philip', 'Quast', 'greatest', 'Javert', 'ever', 'well', 'enough', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'up-close', 'interpretation', 'more', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'Patti', 'Lu', 'Pone', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'hit', 'operatic', 'Cossette', 'notes', 'not', 'skill', 'other', 'Cossettes', 'Samantha', 'Barks', 'Eponine', 'home', 'run', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'background', 'Eddie', 'Redmaine', 'may', 'be', 'Michael', 'Ball', 'sympathetic', 'Marius', 'Amanda', 'do', 'make', 'good', 'couple.This', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'have', 'screen', 'most', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'original', 'stage', 'presentation', 'should', 'be', 'happy.For', 'who', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'sung-all-the-way-through', 'aspect', 'Les', 'Mis', 'should', 'probably', 'be', 'seeking', 'non-musical', 'movies', 'plays', 'first', 'place']",N/A

How caring for Cosette changes Valjean's life, and perception of living - all in the middle of the French Revolution - makes for a grand-scale musical and, in the end, an emotionally touching film about sacrifice and love (corny-sounding, but true).

1000636,AVN00ASBFTMN6,B000GAKLZI,Smoking Ace,"[3, 4]","The new film adaptation of the classic novel and musical Les Mis is enjoyable but not without its own imperfections. For those who already love the play, this Les Mis for the most part sticks faithfully to the source material; offering some new great performances of songs now considered standards. For those who are film critics, this film is fine entertainment which at times works very well. There are two things I loved most about this film: Anne Hathaway and the sets. Anne Hathaway was without doubt the best part of the film; not only for playing a great Fantine that was both heart rendering and tragic, but also  for singing a rendition of ""I've dreamed a dream"" that was not only beautiful but agonizing in its despair. It's unfortunate that she is only in the first half of the film, because my main problem with Les Mis is that it doesn't consistently have that deep convincing fervor that was seen in her performance.Numerous critics have  panned Russell Crowe's Javert, and though I tried to like it (""Maybe he's purposely singing badly?""), I can't help but agree. I thought his performance was very bad: no vigor, no charisma, no menace, no life, and a congested voice.  The rest of the cast falls somewhere in between the bars that Crowe and Hathaway have set: most being good, but never reaching great. I liked Jackman's Jean Valjean, I liked Eponine, I liked Maurius, but I never felt any went to the next level. Many of the characters never felt as three dimensional and fleshed out as Fantine. Although Sasha Baron Cohen is usually very vibrant in his roles, here he and Helena Bonham Carter seemed oddly subdued.Not to say that any of these actors were bad, they weren't; there was emotion here. Yet for a film that portrays people going through such horrendous situations, I never felt it was enough. People react to different films on different emotional levels, so many will find these performances to be more powerful than I interpreted. But for me it just seemed like many of these actors were  going through the same motions of the actors that came before them, rather than looking deep within the characters themselves. Yes, Jean Valjean is a valiant character who has been through an incredible journey, but do what the book and play did and give me a personable reason to care, connect me with this character.The film ends on a resounding and empowering note, yet I couldn't help but feel I wanted more. This is a very grandiose film, at times tiresomely so, and for that I would recommend seeing it. The sets are fantastic, the costumes are authentic, and the music is of course powerful. I only wish that I felt more of an emotional connection with the characters who lived within this world, as I did with the book. The film and show are both nearly 3 hrs long, a very small time frame for an adaptation of an 1000+ pg. book, and for this I think the film does an admirable job of presenting such a huge story without losing THAT much of the plot. Again If you love the play and if you love the book, you will most likely find a sense of enjoyment here. But will it be as much? Probably not.3.5/5PROS: Some great performances, sets, costumes, overall a successful transition from stage to screenCONS: Russel Crowe, some of the performances needed more oomph!, drags toward the end",4,3.5  Not perfect but enjoyable at times,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,3313,"['new', 'film', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'novel', 'musical', 'Les', 'Mis', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'own', 'imperfections', 'who', 'already', 'love', 'play', 'Les', 'Mis', 'most', 'part', 'sticks', 'faithfully', 'source', 'material', 'offering', 'new', 'great', 'performances', 'songs', 'now', 'considered', 'standards', 'who', 'are', 'film', 'critics', 'film', 'fine', 'entertainment', 'times', 'works', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'loved', 'most', 'film', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'sets', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'was', 'doubt', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'playing', 'great', 'Fantine', 'was', 'heart', 'rendering', 'tragic', 'also', 'singing', 'rendition', ""'ve"", 'dreamed', 'dream', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'beautiful', 'agonizing', 'despair', 'unfortunate', 'only', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'main', 'problem', 'Les', 'Mis', ""n't"", 'consistently', 'have', 'deep', 'convincing', 'fervor', 'was', 'seen', 'performance.Numerous', 'critics', 'have', 'panned', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Javert', 'tried', 'like', 'Maybe', 'purposely', 'singing', 'badly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'agree', 'thought', 'performance', 'was', 'very', 'bad', 'vigor', 'charisma', 'menace', 'life', 'congested', 'voice', 'rest', 'cast', 'somewhere', 'bars', 'Crowe', 'Hathaway', 'have', 'set', 'most', 'being', 'good', 'never', 'reaching', 'great', 'liked', 'Jackman', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'liked', 'Eponine', 'liked', 'Maurius', 'never', 'felt', 'went', 'next', 'level', 'Many', 'characters', 'never', 'felt', 'three', 'dimensional', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Fantine', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'usually', 'very', 'vibrant', 'roles', 'here', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'seemed', 'oddly', 'subdued.Not', 'say', 'actors', 'were', 'bad', 'were', ""n't"", 'was', 'emotion', 'here', 'film', 'people', 'going', 'such', 'horrendous', 'situations', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'enough', 'People', 'react', 'different', 'films', 'different', 'emotional', 'levels', 'so', 'many', 'will', 'find', 'performances', 'be', 'more', 'powerful', 'interpreted', 'just', 'seemed', 'many', 'actors', 'were', 'going', 'same', 'motions', 'actors', 'came', 'rather', 'looking', 'deep', 'characters', 'Yes', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'valiant', 'character', 'who', 'been', 'incredible', 'journey', 'do', 'what', 'book', 'play', 'did', 'give', 'personable', 'reason', 'care', 'connect', 'character.The', 'film', 'resounding', 'empowering', 'note', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'wanted', 'more', 'very', 'grandiose', 'film', 'times', 'tiresomely', 'so', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'sets', 'are', 'fantastic', 'costumes', 'are', 'authentic', 'music', 'course', 'powerful', 'only', 'wish', 'felt', 'more', 'emotional', 'connection', 'characters', 'who', 'lived', 'world', 'did', 'book', 'film', 'show', 'are', 'nearly', '3', 'hrs', 'long', 'very', 'small', 'time', 'frame', 'adaptation', '1000+', 'pg', 'book', 'think', 'film', 'admirable', 'job', 'presenting', 'such', 'huge', 'story', 'losing', 'THAT', 'much', 'plot', 'Again', 'love', 'play', 'love', 'book', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'find', 'sense', 'enjoyment', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'Probably', 'not.3.5/5PROS', 'great', 'performances', 'sets', 'costumes', 'overall', 'successful', 'transition', 'stage', 'screenCONS', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'performances', 'needed', 'more', 'oomph', 'end']",N/A

1000659,A1ZQ8ILSBK27FU,B000GAKLZI,"Sweetsgl ""sweetsgl""","[3, 4]","As a huge ""Les Miz"" fan, having seen the stage version probably 10 times, I was eagerly anticipating the film.  After Hugh Jackman's Oscar nomination and Anne Hathaway's win, I was certain it would be a fabulous experience. Had I never seen the Broadway productions, I may have been entranced, and so there is bias in this review.  Those who have never seen a performance on stage may be happy with the acting and the abbreviated snippets of song as well as the portrayals of the various characters.  So, here are the pros and cons from my viewpoint:Pros:  Hugh Jackman manages to capture Jean Valjean's character, his fundamental decency, his heart.  He does a good job vocally, and he engages the audience even through the stilted, sung dialog.  You have to care about Jean Valjean, and thanks to Jackman, the audience does so.Eddie Redmayne is a perfect Marius!  This British actor is not well-known to American audiences but his is a breakthrough performance, and we are sure to see a lot more of him.  And--surprisingly--he's not only good looking (in a typically English way) but by golly, he can sing!Anne Hathaway deserved her Oscar. 'Nuff said.Cosette was well-done also, although she struggled a bit with the vocals.  Her looks--perfect!As others have mentioned, the script did manage to portray the Christian message of love as salvation, carried out through forgiveness, compassion, caring for others, humility, and grace.  Its all there, and it isn't overdone.Cons:  I assume the songs had to be truncated to economize on the length of the film, but sadly, this sacrifice felt to me like throwing away the popcorn and eating the box.  I very much missed the orchestra, and especially the musical themes that reappear throughout the score of the beloved stage show, interwoven with one another.  Some of the solos, like ""Who Am I...Jean Valjean"" really sacrificed a great deal emotionally because of being shortened and without the orchestration.  Ditto for Fantine's death solo.In most of the Broadway shows, the Innkeeper and his wife are portrayed very differently--more as buffoons, and less as slimy, lecherous harlequins.  When portrayed as rather doltish clowns, the Innkeeper's ""Master of the House"" number is a hilarious, audience-rousing, almost joyful highlight of the show.  It allows us to laugh a little at this couple's stupidity, greed, and self-deception.  Alas, that isnt the case in the movie version.  The scene comes off as grisly and distasteful instead, with the Innkeeper and his wife cast as outright sociopaths, rather than clueless victims themselves of poverty and illiteracy and their own limited life circumstances.What happened to The Pup?  He is so central to the final scenes of the Broadway version--an elfish, beguiling youngster, who just captures your heart.  That makes his songs at the barricade particularly engaging and his death heartbreaking.  This movie somehow misses the mark.  Another opportunity lost.Others have castigated Russell Crowe's performance of Inspector Javert.  I like Russell Crowe.  But he took on a script that made his character into a 2-dimensional, Snidely Whiplash character, and he wasn't up to the vocals.  What can I say. To appreciate his acting chops, check out ""Master and Commander"", in which he is every inch the British seacaptain.So, in the end, if you are looking for anything close to the stage performance, I'd save the bucks and buy another ticket to the real deal.  If you have never seen Les Miz and don't mind the Cliff Notes version, this could work for you.But remember, you're getting a plain hamburger, not a Ruth Chris steak dinner :)",3,"Interesting adaptation, musical disappointment",1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,3635,"['huge', 'Les', 'Miz', 'fan', 'having', 'seen', 'stage', 'version', 'probably', '10', 'times', 'was', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'film', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'win', 'was', 'certain', 'would', 'be', 'fabulous', 'experience', 'Had', 'never', 'seen', 'Broadway', 'productions', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'entranced', 'so', 'bias', 'review', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'performance', 'stage', 'may', 'be', 'happy', 'acting', 'abbreviated', 'snippets', 'song', 'as', 'well', 'portrayals', 'various', 'characters', 'So', 'here', 'are', 'pros', 'cons', 'viewpoint', 'Pros', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'capture', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'character', 'fundamental', 'decency', 'heart', 'good', 'job', 'vocally', 'audience', 'even', 'stilted', 'sung', 'dialog', 'have', 'care', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'thanks', 'Jackman', 'audience', 'so.Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'perfect', 'Marius', 'British', 'actor', 'not', 'well-known', 'American', 'audiences', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'are', 'sure', 'see', 'lot', 'more', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'looking', 'typically', 'English', 'way', 'golly', 'can', 'sing', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'said.Cosette', 'was', 'well-done', 'also', 'struggled', 'bit', 'vocals', 'looks', 'perfect', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'script', 'did', 'manage', 'portray', 'Christian', 'message', 'love', 'salvation', 'carried', 'out', 'forgiveness', 'compassion', 'caring', 'others', 'humility', 'grace', 'there', ""n't"", 'overdone.Cons', 'assume', 'songs', 'had', 'be', 'truncated', 'economize', 'length', 'film', 'sadly', 'sacrifice', 'felt', 'throwing', 'away', 'popcorn', 'eating', 'box', 'very', 'much', 'missed', 'orchestra', 'especially', 'musical', 'themes', 'reappear', 'score', 'beloved', 'stage', 'show', 'interwoven', 'one', 'solos', 'Who', 'Am', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'really', 'sacrificed', 'great', 'deal', 'emotionally', 'being', 'shortened', 'orchestration', 'Ditto', 'Fantine', 'death', 'solo.In', 'most', 'Broadway', 'shows', 'Innkeeper', 'wife', 'are', 'portrayed', 'very', 'differently', 'more', 'buffoons', 'slimy', 'lecherous', 'harlequins', 'When', 'portrayed', 'rather', 'doltish', 'clowns', 'Innkeeper', 'Master', 'House', 'number', 'hilarious', 'audience-rousing', 'almost', 'joyful', 'highlight', 'show', 'laugh', 'little', 'couple', 'stupidity', 'greed', 'self-deception', 'Alas', 'case', 'movie', 'version', 'scene', 'off', 'grisly', 'distasteful', 'instead', 'Innkeeper', 'wife', 'cast', 'outright', 'sociopaths', 'rather', 'clueless', 'victims', 'poverty', 'illiteracy', 'own', 'limited', 'life', 'circumstances.What', 'happened', 'Pup', 'so', 'central', 'final', 'scenes', 'Broadway', 'version', 'elfish', 'beguiling', 'youngster', 'who', 'just', 'heart', 'songs', 'barricade', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'death', 'heartbreaking', 'movie', 'somehow', 'mark', 'opportunity', 'lost.Others', 'have', 'castigated', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'performance', 'Inspector', 'Javert', 'like', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'took', 'script', 'made', 'character', '2-dimensional', 'Snidely', 'Whiplash', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'vocals', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'appreciate', 'acting', 'chops', 'check', 'Master', 'Commander', 'inch', 'British', 'seacaptain.So', 'end', 'are', 'looking', 'anything', 'close', 'stage', 'performance', ""'d"", 'save', 'bucks', 'buy', 'ticket', 'real', 'deal', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Les', 'Miz', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'version', 'could', 'work', 'you.But', 'remember', ""'re"", 'getting', 'plain', 'hamburger', 'not', 'Ruth', 'Chris', 'steak', 'dinner']",N/A

The radical weight loss and cutting of her own hair makes a dramatic story, but didn't help her performance. Once Hathaway (Fantine) dies, the movie picks up A LOT.Crowe, well, I don't even know why he was cast in a musical. He sings like he talks. His two solos were his strongest.The standouts, in my opinion, were Bonham-Carter and Baron Cohen. ""Master of the House"" is always a show stopper, but this was magnificent. I had to see it twice. There are obvious differences to the stage show, which is expected, but the differences are what make it work. Redmayne (Marius) gave a surprisingly good performance as well! Who knew the guy could sing? He was excellent! He's definitely moving up in the world. Barks (Eponine) and the ensemble revolutionaries were EXCELLENT. The non-Hollywood stars made the whole thing vibrant and alive.I couldn't have imagined how the creators could pull off a film version of a theater production, but they succeed wildly.Maybe I am sentimental and emotional, but the story is FABULOUS. The sets, costuming and make-up make the perfect impact. I am probably drawing on my emotional connection to the theater production as well.

1000666,AZ3ESALUSJ6JX,B000GAKLZI,Ted Hitchens,"[3, 5]","Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with the new movie Les Miserables.  I expected a much more powerful result from the director of The King's Speech which is one of my favorite recent films.  I've seen the Broadway show twice, a few high school productions of it, and I've read Victor Hugo's book.  I've even played in an orchestra for a theater troupe that did Les Mis so I (like most of us) am very familiar with the characters, story, and the music.  One of my favorite musicals!  But I still nit-picked.First the good:  I thought the film's costumes were fantastic and the sets were very well done, though the wide-angle shots displayed some very unconvincing backgrounds.  Anne Hathaway's performance was by far the best in the movie; she certainly deserved that Oscar.  Despite being skeptic of Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, I was impressed with his performance also.Criticisms:  With the exception of Anne Hathaway, not a single character/singer put much passion into the songs - a critical element considering such a passionate story with passionate music.  I thought Russell Crowe did very well as long as he wasn't singing.  When the characters sang ""One Day More,"" I felt as though they were thinking let's-just-sing-this-real-quick-and-get-it-over-with, and the actress who played Cosette was killing me with the vibratos (it's not an opera, honey!).  Helena Bonham Carter was hilarious as she always is; too bad Monsieur Thenardier couldn't match her antics.  The dialog among the characters felt very jostled, as though they were always in a hurry to sing the next song - this resulted in a very odd pace and left the viewer thinking that the whole thing felt rushed.I will recommend this film to anyone who has never seen the musical and is curious of what all the hype is about (may want to first borrow it from the library or a friend or find it in Red Box).  There are also many other (and better) movie versions of Les Mis.

That having been said, I will begin with the things I did like.  Anne Hathaway's performance was breathtaking.  It is not the &#34;pretty&#34; version of &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; we are used to, and that is not only ok, but completely appropriate.  Hugh Jackman is not Colm Wilkinson, but he did make the role of Jean Valjean his own.  I think having Colm on set was good for Hugh.  Colm could act as a mentor of sorts, and Hugh did a great job of showing the growth in Valjean over the course of the show.  Sasha Baron Cohen and Helenna Bonham Carter, two performers who I usually do NOT like, were fabulous in the roles of the Innkeeper and his wife.  They were deliciously evil and unscrupulous.  Cosset, who I usually find tedious, was portrayed in a much more in depth manner than I have usually seen, and I actually liked her.  Marius was good, but the actor has a sort of permanent smile on his face, which bothered me just a bit.  The student revolutionaries were magnificent.  Certainly a high point of the show.  Eponine was magnificent as well!Now for the low points.  First and foremost, Russell Crowe was awful as Javert.  His singing voice was shallow, and his acting was one dimensional.  I would have much preferred an unknown who could sing and act over Crowe.  The only other thing that I did not like was the director's apparent fondness for showing bodily fluids, and I don't mean blood.  If I never see another sweaty face or runny nose again as long as I live, that will be fine!With all of this, I would still recommend that anyone who likes musical theatre to see this.

If you have ever seen the stage version the music so completely overwhelms you and sweeps you up that it's a miracle you can keep yourself from marching up on stage for the grand finale! And yet you also think, ""Man, what if they incorporated amazing sets and acting and made this a real play... it would be EPIC!"" And then you see the movie version and you just know that Liam Neeson is the perfect Val Jean, that if only every man, father, guardian were as he the world would spontaneously erupt into heaven; and that all the Javerts of the world would be compelled to commit suicide because Geoffrey Rush portrayed him so perfectly as the despicable villain that somehow still makes you feel sorry for him. And yet you are left thinking, ""Man, what if they could sing too, and combine this incredible story with the soul hailing music... it would be EPIC!""Everyone looking forward to the new Les Mis, myself included, just knew that it had the potential to be the most EPIC of all EPIC movie experiences in the history of EVER! Which is why, I think, we have tried so hard to love it. Against our better judgment we act like it HAS to be amazing, because if not the disappointment will consume us, because there is no way in our lifetimes they'll ever re-do this movie. We desperately NEED to love it!But the problem is, it's just NOT epic. Not even close. It leaves you worse off than the play or the non-musical movie because now they've worked you up for nothing.We get a sleazy, staccato Val Jean who seems afraid to hold any one note too long for fear we'll realize his vocal ineptitude and who can't for the life of himself remember if he's merely haunted by his evil past, or continues to be haunted by an evil nature. It's a sad day in Les Mis history when Val Jean hasn't been able to present his good will, up-standing moral character and changed life well enough that when he comes upon Cosette in the woods all you can think is, ""Run AWAY, little girl, don't you dare tell that creep your name, you're better off with the Thenardiers!""And then there's Javert.... Oh where do we start? Russell Crowe's singing ""ability"" (if you can call it that) makes you pity him so much you wish for his sake he'd just thrown himself off the dock at the beginning of the movie and gotten it over with it. There's no denying that Crowe is normally your fail-proof actor, and he does try his best, but even he sings as if simultaneously reading the future reviews that will come slamming on to his head after the movie comes out. There are moments where his gaze seems faintly apologetic - you can almost see his brain scroll reading, ""Damn those iron-clad Hollywood contracts, I knew this was a bad idea!""  He's working so hard on getting.the.notes.right, that we don't even get the pleasure of seeing his facial expressions change, much less portray the relentless abiding-by-the-letter-of-the-law stigma of Javert.Now Anne Hatthaway is practically hallowed ground, upon which we dare not tread. But tread we must... or plod, or trample... heck, let's just pull out the backhoe and tear out the whole plot. Anne, in this role, is reminiscent of the community theater diva who thinks she's so amazing that she has to stay in character 24/7, and misses the point that it's not all about her (the actress) every time she's on stage... that there's a bigger story to tell than her own overly-acted pitiful drama that lasts only long enough for you to ponder how she went from ""innocent sister"" to ""lovely lady"" with a haircut and a lost tooth. I cannot deny that she's got fairly functional pipes (compared to her co-stars...which is like saying Brad Pitt is an excellent actor because his co-star is Kristen Stewart), but seriously, I don't want to actually SEE them. And while I could lament about the mind-numbing choice of the Academy to honor her with an Oscar, I stopped being shocked by them back when Sandra Bullock won for Blind Side and Kiera Knightly was nominated for P&P.; Clearly the highly acclaimed board is made up of E! retirees... or a million monkeys at a million Oscar ballot stations...In case you think I'm unwittingly bashing right and left out of pure spite, let me hit the two high notes before it plunges back down again: The Thenardiers and the Revolution Chorus.The Thenardiers = absolute perfection. Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen (it's probably the matching last names) are absolutely the only actors to mesh acting talent, musical chops and the completely necessary, ""I don't care if you like me or not"" attitude so lacking in the rest of the cast. Sascha's deliciously over-the-top, hilariously disgusting, pick-pocketing rendition of Mr. Thenardier is spot-on, and Helena is the Victor to his Hugo. Her money-fetish flirting is only rivaled by her split-second switch to evil faces at those who would get in her way. I have read that some think she was too tame, too bland... but that is the problem with this whole movie. Subtleties are what bring about the richness of character. If you have to have every fleeting emotion blown up in lights for you to get it, well... then... go back and watch I Dreamed A Dream to your heart's content.The Revolution Chorus (aka all the people who SHOULD have had the leads) were so SO good. Painfully good. It was hard to understand how the director could have got it so right for those few, short scenes and so very wrong for nearly every other. Yes, I actually teared up during Red and Black... mostly mourning what the movie could have, should have been! *moment of silence please*I suppose I cannot forget to mention the younger actors who had a much easier time actually acting while singing. This came as a welcome respite... but only in the sense that a starved person relishes stale bread crusts. When you've been suffering so long, you'll take what you can get.Eddie Redmayne is probably the best of the bunch, and if you can get past him singing like he's got a small colony of frogs living in his throat you just might be able to appreciate his capability. Amanda Seyfried is hard to diss for her portrayal of Cossette. There was so little developing of her character that the actress had no time to let her talent shine and so all I could do was hope to goodness her out-of-control vibrato didn't send her spinning across the room. Samantha Barks is inexplicably the lone stage transplant, the Broadway aura seeping from her pores in every bland camera close-up. Yes, sure, she stands the test of the unforgiving choice to do live singing, but earns a bright red F when it comes to the unforgiving lack of distance she is usually afforded with her audience. She gives us no insight into why she loves Marius, why she would be willing to protect his love for Cossette, how on earth she turned out so normal being raised by the Thernardiers, why she had to dress like a man to fight, why she kept the love letter when she'd already taken Marius to the girl and why-oh-why her mascara didn't run when she sings in the rain! Her dimples are adorable, though.Of course, we must give credit where credit is due: The King's Speech. To be clear, the only reason Tom Hooper was allowed so MANY missteps in the painful, torturous destruction of a classic is the sainthood he earned in his flawless making of the rightfully acclaimed King's Speech film. But come ON, people. Just as we should have given Peter Jackson a hearty pat on the back after LOTR and then a hearty pat on the backpack as we sent him packing after the horror show King Kong, so must our treatment be of Mr. Hooper.I absolutely commend and SUPPORT the idea of live singing! As the cast explains, it is hard to decide how you will react in a studio months before you actually shoot the scene, which can lead to some of the robotic or slightly ""off"" moments we've seen in other blockbuster musicals (The Music Man, and even moments of Phantom of the Opera). But IF you will make this bold choice, you absolutely MUST compensate with TRAINED and GLORIOUS voices! Besides the fact that this heavenly score deserves only the most angelic voices our planet can produce, if you are going to slow down the action and, in essence, put the movie on pause for every musical number (98.2% of the movie), in order for your cast to be able to perform, you had better make those notes goose bump-worthy good. Instead, it feels like any momentum gained by the non-vocal parts of the score come to a screeching halt when a cast member puts to use his or her unassisted vocal chords and begins wandering around an obvious rolling camera, allowing us to scrutinize every painful note they eject.But truly, the greatest travesty of all is the disservice to the story, though I admit I have not read the book. It is a beautiful story of a man redeemed, a woman restored, a girl rescued, a villain drowned, true love... and the French Revolution. Oh, yes, that IS the major point around which the whole end of the narrative turns did you not notice? Considering that the startup of the rebellion at Le Marquis's funeral looks more like a flash mob than a revolution, that the only real fighting we actually see is when a cute little boy gets shot for apparently no good reason, that the empty tables and chairs are only tragic when you understand the cost, and that the final battle is to be waged between dead people and... no one... you probably didn't.Of course, you can't deny that the music in itself is inspiring, and they really did pull out the stops for the big numbers, and you almost... almost... get as excited as Anne Hatthaway at the final number... okay, scratch that, NO ONE gets as excited as Anne Hatthaway, but truly, the end does make you want to clap, to cheer, if only because you've finally finished this train-wreck on reels. And to top it all off, they even get you writhing at the credits... when you just realize you've watched Colm Wilkinson throughout the whole movie and were gypped of his phenomenal voice soaring through the flawless score!So, Epic? Well, to use another over-used idiom of the times... it's certainly an epic FAIL!",2,"This puts the ""miserable"" in Les Miserables",1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,10163,"['Les', 'Mis', 'had',

I was just not overjoyed to see them all together. Many of the songs worked magnificently. There was a lot of song dialouge that didn't work as well. I felt this should have been a musical rather than an opera. I was surprised at how well the actors could hold their notes, like a professional, yet not sound as well on simpler tunes. There are also professional singers who can act (not 50 Cent). Personally I would have cast them.How is it all these Frenchmen have British accents? The music enhances the already rolling coaster ride of emotion of the saga, making the highs higher and lows lower. There has been almost a void of decent musicals in the motion picture industry since the 1960's. This one fills the void with a great story and cinematography. You are hooked on the film by a brilliant opening scene with Jackman surprising the bejesus out of me with his singing and Crowe does not.As a musical, I won't rush out and buy the sound track. Looks good on the big screen. But seriously, 5 stars? Perhaps the most amazing thing is that Russell Crowe, who can't carry a tune in a bucket, got a major starring role in a musical.

1000680,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B000GAKLZI,The People's Critic,"[5, 11]","It is a fairly accepted story that when the sculptor, Auguste Rodin wanted to sculpt Victor Hugo, Hugo agreed, but demanded Rodin come to his house, and he refused to pose for him. This prompted Rodin to frantically sketch the poet and attempt to capture his essence. This interpretation of Victor Hugo worked out and resulted in some famous sketches, busts and sculptures. It also worked out in 1985 when Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg interpreted Hugo's masterpiece Les Mis&eacute;rables into a global musical sensation. Now, as 2012 draws to a close, another interpretation of Hugo's Les Mis&eacute;rables has been released. Director Tom Hooper follows his best picture Oscar winning film The Kings Speech with the first ever film adaptation of the 1985 musical Les Mis&eacute;rables. Unfortunately, Tom Hooper is no Rodin.Les Mis&eacute;rables (never to be referred to as ""Lay Miz"" in this review) is set during the French Revolution and follows the trials of ex-prisoner Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) over a seventeen year period. During that time, Valjean experiences the endurance and integrity of the human spirit as he relentlessly sacrifices his wellbeing for the good of his adopted daughter, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried). Much of Hugo's original Romantic vision is simplified both for stage and for screen. All versions, however, do condemn the corruption of society as its technological advances inspire greed that leads to abuse of the working class, desperation, increases in criminal activity, and a justifiable uprising. Most evocative of this progression of devastation is the story of Fantine (Anne Hathaway), who when fired from her low-paying factory job is forced to sell her teeth, hair, and body to support her daughter. Hathaway has received praise and criticism for her performance as Fantine. However, the fact remains that while not a traditional Broadway-style singer, what Hathaway lacks in technical singing ability, she more than makes up for in emotional presence. Her rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is heartbreaking and touching.While Hathaway performs her role very well, there truly is not enough here to warrant too much attention. Hugh Jackman, on the other hand, turns out a career defining performance that alone makes Les Mis&eacute;rables worth the price of admission. This is Jackman's movie in every single way. Les Mis&eacute;rables is a ""sung-through"" musical, which means there is no spoken dialogue; all conversations and speeches are sung. This can prove a challenge for many actors, yet Jackman accomplishes this task expertly with every bit of rawness necessary. Jackman is so good in fact, that he makes it easier to overlook the film's two most glaring faults: its direction and Russell Crowe.Tom Hooper has directed a very standard looking and staged feeling musical here. His actors save the film, which in essence is stylistically a spliced together collection of absurdly close-up one shots that go on for several minutes without cutting. To call this minimalism would be vastly understating it. While it can be argued that more aggressive direction may compete with the actors' performances, it is impossible to look back on the film after viewing it and not feel like an opportunity was missed to make it something more. He does offer a glimpse of creativity with the film's opening scene as well as his staging of the comic relief number, ""Master of the House,"" expertly casting Sasha Baron Cohen as Thenardier and Helena Bonhem Carter as his wife.Additionally, Russell Crowe, who plays Inspector Javert, simply can not hold his own as the film's second lead. It is painstakingly obvious how hard he is trying, and this perceptibility is deeply distracting. Crowe does not ruin the film, however since the heart wrenching story and incredible music make up for much of the film's shortcomings. ""One Day More"" is arguably the film's most powerful song, and it is sure to stick with audience members well after the credits roll. At the end of the day, Les Mis&eacute;rables is mostly effective, especially to original fans of the musical. Nevertheless, it is mostly an underwhelming film, with occasional glimmers of substance, all of which are a consequence of Hugh Jackman's powerhouse performance.

Great acting in the midst of the singing, by the way. Russell Crowe may not be the best singer in the world, but he does try his best, and he does act with the conviction and then the uncertainty of Javert. Jean Valjean, as played by Hugh Jackman, ages gracefully throughout the movie, becoming a noble man, and Anne Hathaway is great as Fantine. The Thenardier couple, played by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, are the right comedic notes necessary to sustain interest in the movie, and Eddie Redmayne as Marius and the rest of his revolutionary friends are absolutely tragic/brilliant, not to mention Eponine, wonderfully portrayed by Samantha Barks.

1000684,ATO37N3ISK12B,B000GAKLZI,"The thinker ""corp trainer""","[3, 3]","I thought it was time I put in my two cents on this, the movie version of Les Miserables. I have seen the play four times.Once in LA, once in Seattle, and twice in Florida and I must say each time was a thrilling experience. Having said that, my wife and I were really looking forward to the movie version.To be honest after seeing the stage show ,which was consistant each time I don't think I would have ever considered Hugh Jackman for the part of Jean Valjean but I must say he suprised ,delighted, and hit it out of the park for both of us. Another stellar performance was Anne Hathaway's Fantine and her rendition of I dreamed a dream. It was a stunner. Of all the times I have seen the show , nothing came close to her heart breaking performance .She brought me to tears.There were some changes and omissions but all in all the spirit, grandur,and the incredible music was there. Of course some things were better than others for instance,Helena Bonham Carter & Sacha Baron Cohen's Master of the House was just adequate but was a highlight in the show for comic relief. Here is my one rub. Les Miserables is not a musical, it is an opera, the difference is ,a musical has both spoken words and singing where an opera is singing only. When you see an opera you expect to have all actors with great singing voices. That brings me to Russell Crowe who plays Javert a main figure in both the play and movie. In the play Javert was powerful in both stature and voice . however, in Crowe's performance ,the stature was there but the voice was not and that was a bit of a disappointment thus, removing one star from my rating .Bottom line, it is a great movie experience.",4,Les Miserables  the Movie,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,1671,"['thought', 'was', 'time', 'put', 'two', 'cents', 'movie', 'version', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'have', 'seen', 'play', 'four', 'times.Once', 'LA', 'once', 'Seattle', 'twice', 'Florida', 'must', 'say', 'time', 'was', 'thrilling', 'experience', 'Having', 'said', 'wife', 'were', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'version.To', 'be', 'honest', 'seeing', 'stage', 'show', 'was', 'consistant', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'considered', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'part', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'must', 'say', 'suprised', 'delighted', 'hit', 'park', 'stellar', 'performance', 'was', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Fantine', 'rendition', 'dreamed', 'dream', 'was', 'stunner', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'nothing', 'came', 'close', 'heart', 'breaking', 'performance', '.She', 'brought', 'tears.There', 'were', 'changes', 'omissions', 'spirit', 'grandur', 'incredible', 'music', 'was', 'there', 'course', 'things', 'were', 'better', 'others', 'instance', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Master', 'House', 'was', 'just', 'adequate', 'was', 'highlight', 'show', 'comic', 'relief', 'Here', 'one', 'rub', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'not', 'musical', 'opera', 'difference', 'musical', 'spoken', 'words', 'singing', 'where', 'opera', 'singing', 'only', 'When', 'see', 'opera', 'expect', 'have', 'actors', 'great', 'singing', 'voices', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'Javert', 'main', 'figure', 'play', 'movie', 'play', 'Javert', 'was', 'powerful', 'stature', 'voice', 'however', 'Crowe', 'performance', 'stature', 'was', 'there', 'voice', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'thus', 'removing', 'one', 'star', 'rating', '.Bottom', 'line', 'great', 'movie', 'experience']",N/A

Russell Crowe did his stalwart best with Javert, but in truth his singing is not even up to snuff for a high school musical, let alone a major film production of such a great stage work.  I admire him because it's clear he really worked hard to make this as good as could be, but the audience should not have to capitulate to such a poor casting choice.  A unknown with a singer's voice would have been a better choice.  Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman were truly impressive, but I can't fight the urge to root out the person who coached their vocal preparation, and urge them to take up another career.  Properly coached these two could have won complete and utter acclaim for these roles.  Some of the sounds Hugh Jackman made absolutely thrilled me, but also so many badly placed sounds....so many vowels pinched....so many great musical phrase turned into kitschy singing because he was not prepared well for this.  The ensemble pieces were brilliant and the choral sound was thrilling.If only the performance overall could have been on a par with Th&eacute;nardier and Madame Th&eacute;nardier and conveyed the outstanding singing done on roles of Cosette, Epinone, & Marius this review would be five stars.",4,Stunning Production Values & Some Great Performances,1367798400,"05 6, 2013",2013,1302,"['really', 'captivating', 'rendition', 'show', 'found', 'so', 'much', 'very', 'moving', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'did', 'stalwart', 'best', 'Javert', 'truth', 'singing', 'not', 'even', 'snuff', 'high', 'school', 'musical', 'let', 'alone', 'major', 'film', 'production', 'such', 'great', 'stage', 'work', 'admire', 'clear', 'really', 'worked', 'hard', 'make', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'audience', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'capitulate', 'poor', 'casting', 'choice', 'unknown', 'singer', 'voice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'were', 'truly', 'impressive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fight', 'urge', 'root', 'out', 'person', 'who', 'coached', 'vocal', 'preparation', 'urge', 'take', 'up', 'career', 'Properly', 'coached', 'two', 'could', 'have', 'won', 'complete', 'utter', 'acclaim', 'roles', 'sounds', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'made', 'absolutely', 'thrilled', 'also', 'so', 'many', 'badly', 'placed', 'sounds', '.so', 'many', 'vowels', 'pinched', '.so', 'many', 'great', 'musical', 'phrase', 'turned', 'kitschy', 'singing', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'well', 'ensemble', 'pieces', 'were', 'brilliant', 'choral', 'sound', 'was', 'thrilling.If', 'only', 'performance', 'overall', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'par', 'Th', 'eacute', 'Madame', 'Th', 'eacute', 'conveyed', 'outstanding', 'singing', 'done', 'roles', 'Cosette', 'Epinone', 'Marius', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'five', 'stars']",N/A
1000686,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000GAKLZI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 6]","I would venture to say most American movie-goers have never had the opportunity to see a Broadway musical. Why? Opportunity, desire, you choose. And because musicals are a relative scarcity in the multiplex these days, people aren't used to live action musicals of any kind. Many are probably unaware there are different kinds of musicals. ""Chicago"", ""The Producers"", ""Mamma Mia"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" are the most common form of musicals. Actors speak dialogue and the story moves forward as most films do, but they frequently stop and break out into a song and dance, delivering a musical number that should help move the story forward. But there are also `operatic musicals', productions in which virtually every word is sung and the musical numbers are still there, but less defined. ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Les Miserables"" are examples of this type of musical.I know a lot of people who would rather have their toenails pulled out with pliers than to sit through a movie musical. These same people detest `operatic musicals' because they never get a break from the music and singing.If you are one of these people, you will not like ""Les Mis"". But if a musical is made well, it can really transport you, enveloping all of your senses. And ""Les Mis"" is made very well; a highly emotional, very satisfying adaptation of one of the most successful, longest running musicals in history.The story is very familiar. Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman, calling on his Broadway skills) is imprisoned for stealing bread to feed a sick family member. Many years later, he is released on probation by Javert (Russell Crowe) who promises to keep an eye on the criminal, watching for any mistake, ready to jail him in an instant. Flash forward a few years and Valjean is now living under another identity as the owner of a factory making rosary beads. A successful man, he is surprised when Javert shows up in the small town. Javert seems to recognize Valjean, but can't place him. Nervous, Valjean ignores the pleas of Fantine (Anne Hathaway), one of the factory workers trying to evade the lecherous foreman. Fantine is fired and falls of hard times, very hard times. Eventually Valjean realizes what has happened and pledges to her that he will find her daughter and care for her. Javert also realizes who Valjean is and is hot on his heels. Valjean finds Fantine's daughter, Cosette in the care of the Thenardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter), dubious inn-keepers constantly looking for more money. Flash forward a few years and Valjean and Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) are back in Paris when Marius (Eddie Redmayne) spots the young lady and instantly falls in love. Marius is a very involved in the student movement and will soon help start the French Revolution. Valjean, Javert and Cosette will all become involved in the event that will change the history of France.Directed by Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech""), ""Les Mis"" is a passionate, rousing, extremely emotional and ultimately uneven experience. It is highly satisfying, but because so much of the film is so good, the parts that aren't are even more egregious and annoying.Hugh Jackman has been spending a lot of time performing on Broadway, shifting back and forth between stage and screen. He clearly has the chops to handle a musical and does a great job as Prisoner 24601. He goes through a lot, experiences a lot and changes a lot throughout the course of the story. This may be one of the biggest understatements ever, but to go into too much detail would spoil some of the surprise for people unfamiliar with the story. Let's just say he faces many obstacles and challenges.But as Valjean climbs each mountain and faces each challenge, you always get a feeling for his inner conscience. Jackman subtly shows us that even when Valjean is doing something wrong, he is at great pains when doing it. And he always tries to do something to compensate for the past error.Russell Crowe is another matter entirely. He doesn't have the skill or chops to carry the musical part of his role as Javert, the extremely tenacious gendarme. Everything he sings sounds the same which is problematic because he has to show us the emotions his character is living through. He pretty much glares at people throughout the film, rarely giving us insight into his character.Crowe deserves a lot of credit for going out of his comfort zone, but the filmmakers should have stayed away from the star's pull and sought out a performer who could do the role justice.Remember when Anne Hathaway and James Franco hosted the Oscars? There seemed to be two general thoughts about their work; 1. James Franco looked uncomfortable and uneasy throughout most of the show and 2. Surprise that Anne Hathaway could sing. Her performance as Fantine, the single mother working in a factory to earn money for her child, erases the question mark and any doubt. Anne Hathaway CAN sing.I have only seen the musical performed live once and didn't remember that her big moment came so early in the story, but the moment she appears on screen, get your hankies out. Her role is tragic and moving and as she is singing ""I Dream a Dream"", you can see the pain and emotion in her face and hear it in every word she utters. Her character's life ultimately steers Jean Valjean towards his destiny, so it makes sense and needs to happen pretty early to drive the rest of the story.Amanda Seyfried (who was also in ""Mamma Mia""), Eddie Redmayne, who plays her true love, Samantha Banks who plays Eponine and Aaron Tveit who plays Enjorlas are all good, but when you consider the power of Hathaway's performance and the bravado of Jackman's, these younger actors pale in comparison. They all play a part in sparking the French Revolution, which closes the film.Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter play the Thernadiers, shady inn-keepers who seem included to provide a bit of comic relief. Normally, this type of thing wouldn't work very well, but their big song ""Master of the House"" is one of the most memorable and helps to compensate for the obvious nature of their characters.Watching a film musical is a very different thing from watching the same musical performed on stage. It should be a different thing. When you are watching a play, you are looking at the entire stage and as characters move around, your attention is directed to them. As they move back and forth, your eye follows them. Sometimes, you may be watching a scene between two characters at opposite sides of the stage. But the stage is always there and your eye is always moving. When you watch a filmed version of the same play, the filmmakers direct your attention to the focused performer with camera movement, editing, transitions and more. Your eye will process less because the filmmakers have already done this for you. Naturally, watching a live play is to a movie what reading a book is to watching a film adaptation of that book. When you read a book, your mind processes a lot of information and paints pictures for you, guiding you through the story. Sometimes, reading a scary story is a lot more effective than watching a horror story because the images your mind conjures are a lot scarier (and real to you) than what the filmmakers can come up with. Watching a live play is a very different thing because you have to decide where to look, what to concentrate on. You can also look at the whole picture.In ""Les Miserables"", Tom Hooper gives us an intimate view of the story. ""Les Mis"" isn't known for great choreography anyway, so Hooper smartly concentrates on the actors as they perform.He has also gone one step further; the actors sing live throughout the film. In most musicals, the singers record the songs in a studio and then perform the roles to a playback of the song. Watching ""Les Mis"" is a very different experience. You can see the words coming out of the actor's mouths, feel their power, and it also makes the performances more intimate and meaningful.""Les Miserables"" is an emotional, moving experience. And a fitting adaptation of one of the longest running musicals in history. It has some problems, but all-in-all, this is one of the most satisfying films of the year.",4,"A ""Dream"" Becomes A Reality",1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,8197,"['would', 'venture', 'say', 'most',

Even though I was enjoying at the start, I was disappointed about many major issues. At the start I said to my self, its OK if Jean Valjean and any other characters in the movie have no voices as long as they the acting is great, which was, but that killed the intention of being one of the greatest musicals of all times. If I hadn't seen the stage production with fabulous voices and live music, I would probably have given 5 stars. Here are the major issues that I had.1. The make up was over done to create more horrors of the street life.2. 90% of the movie is gloomy, and sad, even when Mario meets Cosette for the first time. The scene should have been lighten with positive colors and emotions, common, its love, give us some light.3. The director missed a lot of details, especially in the song Master of the house.4. Master of the house and his wife wrong casting, they are the best looking actors in the movie, LOL. They should have missing teeth or whatever. Sasha Cohen, did not fit his role not in acting or singing. In stage production this scene is one of the main attraction5. ""Bring him home"" song, which always gives me chills and crowd's standing ovation on stage was destroyed.6. I could hardly hear the orchestra, because the voices were to weak. The music is very powerful and should have been played this way.I could go on, but will stop right there, in my opinion the movie Phantom was much better interpretation than The Miserables, in spite that Phantom had to compete with Michael Crawford.Over all, it was not bad, but I could only watch it once.

1000689,AR2ZNBYLIUYQ6,B000GAKLZI,Timegoesby,"[0, 0]","I was wondering how they would make a film musical of Les Miserables. I thought the movie was okay, but it lacks the emotional depth, drama, and suspense of a traditional film. I think the audience had to have a good understanding of the original story in order to really understand the movie. Otherwise, it's just some former convict being chased by a french policeman, along the way he gains a child to take care of, she grows up, he saves her groom, the policeman and convict die, the end.I think musical is an interesting vehicle for a story that has been interpreted many times over the years. However, I prefer the traditional story. I understand the characters weren't supposed to sing very well (in keeping with their characters) but this means there isn't any amazing music in the movie.Anne Hathaway played Fantine superbly, and sang well. I liked Helen Bonham Carter and Sasha Cohen as the innkeepers. The child who plays Cosette is rather ethereal and haunting, but only appeared briefly. Amanda Seyfried and Russell Crowe sing terribly!The musical stripped the story down to a simple storyline...the full breadth of the story was taken away! The Paris Rebellion part was ridiculous.

1000691,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B000GAKLZI,titania86,"[0, 0]","The plot for Les Miserables is a complex one, so I will only summarize a little bit. Jean Valjean served 19 years in jail and then sheds his identity to escape his criminal past during during the aftermath of the French Revolution. There is so much more that the film is about, but that's the gist of it. I was extremely excited to see this film. I have been listening to the original cast soundtrack since forever with my family and I've seen the stage play about 5 times. I know every lyric and every musical line. I really didn't expect to see or feel anything different because I am so familiar with the source material. I was proven wonderfully wrong. This film made the music and story fresh and new to me.The look of the film is realistic and shows what the musical tends to gloss over: the poor, the dirt, the awful living conditions, and the reality of living in France after the French Revolution. The entire story is put into harsh perspective and put me on the edge of tears right from the beginning because of the realistic pain and suffering of the characters. The way Jean Valjean is treated after serving his time in jail and the conditions Fantine is subjected to after losing her job. The whole film has a raw quality that puts it in stark contrast to the stage play. Despite the lyrics and the makeup on stage, the audience doesn't feel the depression and plight of the poor being portrayed. Everything is put into perspective. The barricade is rather slap dash and small because that's what poor people in France would have been able to spare for it as opposed to the huge construct in the play. The lovely ladies look much more dirty and tired with grotesquely painted faces that inspire more pity than desire. Valjean lived in a constant state of paranoia, ready to flee at any moment and unable to make any lasting ties. I loved that the film took the familiar setting and costumes of the play and brought them into reality.The rawness of the film also extends to the singing, which is probably the most controversial issue. I personally loved the singing and acting. The focus isn't to just sound like a great singer or even to perform the songs flawlessly, but to convey the emotions of the character. These unpolished performances are oftentimes my favorite renditions of the songs over studio versions. The broadway versions are well sung, but don't have the right emotional impact and seem to be too concerned with hitting everything perfectly. Anne Hathaway as Fantine in particular performed phenomenally. Her rendition of I Dreamed a Dream moved me to tears when I never thought much of the song before. This portrayal of raw emotion suddenly made this song one of my favorites. Eddie Redmayne as Marius also greatly impressed me, possessing the most wonderful voice out of the whole cast. I had always dismissed him as the annoying, flat Romeo of the play that just mooned over Juliet/Cosette. The film fleshed out some of his backstory and made him a real, likable character with more aspirations and motivations than just his instalove relationship. His performance of Empty Chairs at Empty Tables is among my favorites and I don't think the emotion of that scene has ever been translated that well before. The other actors are good as well, but these two really stood out to me as talented actors that changed my perspective on their characters and songs.As with any adaptation, the plot and order of events is slightly changed and, for the most part, are improvements to the story. With the play, I was confused as to the logistics of how Valjean escaped with little Cosette and evaded Javert for so long. The film clarifies this and fills in the gaps that were previously left out. Some of the songs were shuffled around a little bit, but the changed order makes more sense to me. Having Lovely Ladies before I Dreamed a Dream makes more sense plotwise and provides the second song with much more emotional impact because Fantine had already hit rock bottom. I appreciated the expansion of Marius' backstory and how he turned his back on his wealthy family to fight for what he felt was right. It showed much more strength and dedication than just the superficial relationship between him and Cosette.The problems I have with the movie are pretty minor. I hate that a lot of the cinematography during the singing portions is super close up on the actors' faces. I can see a few shots like this for emotional impact, but in every single song is a little excessive. The other annoyance is the shortening or omission of important songs. A Little Fall of Rain is a very important and I was shocked to see that it was shortened. The song Turning was practically taken out altogether save for the very beginning of it. The new song Suddenly didn't really have any impact on the film and I thought it was unneeded when other, better songs were cut short. These are relatively small problems and I felt the film was very successful and effective.Les Miserables is the best film adaptation of the play I could have asked for. The performances are nothing short of amazing. (Yes, even Russell Crowe was good in his restrained version of Javert.) I have only seen the film once on Christmas and I plan to see it again soon. I would highly recommend it to fans of musicals that don't mind stripped down, imperfect renditions of these songs.",5,A realistic and raw reimagining of the Broadway show,1389398400,"01 11,

But a STRONG warning for those who had seen Les Mis either on stage in New York City or own the 10th and 25th Anniversary videos.  That is because only they will know the potential of Les Mis.  This is a movie so Hollywood gets involved where it shouldn't, actors singing instead of singers acting.  The ""Javert"" (s) on stage and in the two anniversary videos were fantastic.  In the movie he was okay.  Jean Valjean on stage in New York, Colm Wilkinson, played the priest in the movie.  Jean Valjean in the movie was okay.  Fantine's acting was well done.  But the singing never came close to broadway and therefore very disappointing.  M. Thenardier, the Inn Keeper, was a sleeze, not smart like the one on stage.  And the director having Santa Claus with a prostitute in the Inn was unforgiving . . . wasn't needed and political correct, which too often we can expect from the elites in Hollywood.  In the director's explanation cut on the video, he said Marius and Cosette were picked because they had looked like relatives in Victor's day.  What, in a musical you look for people with faces from old paintings instead of their singing?  Marius could sing but looked too young for the part.  And Cosette, played by the lead from Mama Mia the ABBA movie, just ruined it for us with her voice not even close to the wonderful Cosettes on stage.  In fact it has come to the point we can no longer watch the movie, knowing what Cosette can really sound like.  And the director, along with the actor who played Jean Valjean, said in the cut Les Mis reminded them of . . . wait for it . . . OWS.  What?!  Did they not know OWS was lead by communists in the crowd on the streets against businesses and banks in New York City?  OWS wasn't about abuses of society like in Les Mis. OWS didn't like successful people making money, this in a society overflowing with entitlement programs not exactly the world of Les. Mis.  By the way, the 10th Anniversary is only on DVD, but has an excellent ending with all the Jean Valjeans on stage that have played that part around the world. The 25th Anniversary is on Blu Ray and also excellent. As a final remark, the backgrounds in the movie were truly outstanding.  It's sad the quality of the singing didn't match.

The scenery is both beautifully understated (the convent scenes) and appropriately depressing (the opening slave scene, the dark, dirty brothels). The entire mood of the movie is perfectly appropriate and what you want to see; muted colors, grimy streets, dirty disheveled commoners. The music is glorious.Hugh Jackman is marvelous! Who knew he could ever look so un-handsome and sexy? Forget Wolverine, this guy is aged, weathered, gaunt, and scruffy. Jackman is not a natural tenor, and his voice strains towards the higher notes of his songs, but he hits them. A former musical actor, he's well suited to a singing role. Russell Crowe has also left his sexy young self behind, and is now the middle aged, beefy Javert, and he plays the role elegantly. However, his singing is mediocre at best. He hits the notes, but his voice is very ""chesty"" and not too pleasant to listen to. I'm not a big fan of Anne Hathaway, but she gave it 110% and she has a beautiful voice. I both liked and disliked her emotional butchering of ""I Dreamed A Dream""; it was more realistic in some ways, but I also feel like you should just NEVER undermine that epic song. Amanda Seyfried was a believable Cosette; cute, angelic, innocent, but her quivery chipmunk-like vibrato was almost comical and detracted from her character. Eddie Redmayne as Marius... ughh... Marius is supposed to be handsome! He captures Cossette's heart with one glance. Redmayne is so unbelievable in that role; the guy is UGLY, sorry! Of course H.B. Carter has to make an appearance (seriously, she's like an STD, she's everywhere and not really wanted) as the wife of the innkeeper we all love to hate. I thought their scenes were a bit too corny. While they provide the comic relief in an otherwise dreary story, it's supposed to be understated and brief, not an obnoxious circus act, and I was disappointed in their scenes. I was also delighted to see Colm Wilkinson as the Bishop, as he played Valjean back in the 80's! What fun that must have been for him, to play opposite ""his"" role in the movie. Lastly, Samantha Barks as Eponine was a natural choice, she's played the role on stage and does a lovely job.Note To Parents* While this film has a PG13 rating, there is some graphic violence as well as two very graphic sex scenes that honestly shocked me, as I was in the theater with my friend and her two daughters.

I have watched the Les Mis concert presentations (10th and 25th anniversaries) which include amazing singing but leaves out the acting.  I have watched about three different non-musical dramatic movie presentations.For hard-core broadway buffs, this movie will not satisfy.  The singing is not perfect, there is a raw element to the  singing and the tempo changes within songs based on the actor's portrayal.  As a straight musical, the lack of perfection can be a distraction from songs that theatre buffs know by heart and expect to hear sung brilliantly.But looking beyond perfection, this movie adaptation of the musical brings to life elements that cannot be placed in the live theatre.  A lot of close-ups, showing dirty, scarrred, and uglified faces of the people that must have been in the streets of 19th century France.  There is a raw grittiness to the scenes... nothing is pretty, even Anne Hathaway comes across as emaciated and steadily declines in appearance as her hair is roughly chopped off and she has  teeth pulled for a few francs.  Hugh Jackman's appearance is startling.  The theatre cannot do justice to the rough appearance of  early Valjean that Jackman portrays.The singing is a huge part of this movie, and it ranges from spectacular to passable.  I have read critics who panned Crowe's singing, and although he is certainly not a match for some of theatre's great presentations of Javert, Crowe sings at least decently.  What he lacks in singing he makes up for in his presentation and acting, and all in all I thought he made a fine Javert.I saw this on Christmas day this year and now am waiting impatiently for the DVD.",5,Finally - the musical comes to the movies,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,1726,"['What', 'can', 'saw', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'broadway', 'musical', 'twice', 'have', 'watched', 'Les', 'Mis', 'concert', 'presentations', '10th', '25th', 'anniversaries', 'include', 'amazing', 'singing', 'out', 'acting', 'have', 'watched', 'three', 'different', 'non-musical', 'dramatic', 'movie', 'presentations.For', 'hard-core', 'broadway', 'buffs', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'satisfy', 'singing', 'not', 'perfect', 'raw', 'element', 'singing', 'tempo', 'changes', 'songs', 'based', 'actor', 'portrayal', 'straight', 'musical', 'lack', 'perfection', 'can', 'be', 'distraction', 'songs', 'theatre', 'buffs', 'know', 'heart', 'expect', 'hear', 'sung', 'looking', 'perfection', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'musical', 'brings', 'life', 'elements', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'placed', 'live', 'theatre', 'lot', 'close-ups', 'showing', 'dirty', 'scarrred', 'uglified', 'people', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'streets', '19th', 'century', 'France', 'raw', 'grittiness', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'pretty', 'even', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'emaciated', 'steadily', 'declines', 'appearance', 'hair', 'roughly', 'chopped', 'off', 'teeth', 'pulled', 'few', 'francs', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'appearance', 'startling', 'theatre', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'rough', 'appearance', 'early', 'Valjean', 'Jackman', 'portrays.The', 'singing', 'huge', 'part', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'passable', 'have', 'read', 'critics', 'who', 'panned', 'Crowe', 'singing', 'certainly', 'not', 'match', 'theatre', 'great', 'presentations', 'Javert', 'Crowe', 'sings', 'least', 'decently', 'What', 'singing', 'up', 'presentation', 'acting', 'thought', 'made', 'fine', 'Javert.I', 'saw', 'Christmas', 'day', 'year', 'now', 'am', 'waiting', 'impatiently', 'DVD']",N/A

Revolution has that effect on me.Never read the book or seen the stage production. Strange thing is after having seen the film I can understand how the show was so successful. It's a great date show. An old fashioned weepy. I mean we're talking deep down sad here!It is an opera not a musical. A lot of recitative and only two show-stopping arias. The Table and Chair lyric hit the spot for me even if musically tame.Comic relief was via the triple barrelled twosome of Sasha Baron Cohen and the ever delicious Helena Bonham Carter who returns to the chesty slut role similar to Fight Club. And the Artful Dodger returns! Complete with over-cooked cockney (London) accent but no walking off into the sunset ending for the little scallywag.What more can I say? When it comes to hit London West End stage musicals the 1960s had Oliver! The 1970s had The Rocky Horror Show, the 1980s had Les Mis. I often wondered why an affluent society would flock to see this tale of oppression and despair. But that rousing ending must have been great on stage. Individuals singing together. But it's a four star movie at best. One gorgeous hit song which should have been reprieved later in the film. A lot of close-ups for the singing but no dancing if my memory serves me right.It was a full-house for my cinema viewing in Liverpool. A few ladies managed a ripple of applause at the end.

She would say that the movie stars don't do as good a job as the stage performers, but I think they do just fine. One thing I don't think she, or other people of that opinion, might be considering, is that movie stars don't need to have the power for belting out their songs like a stage performer does.If you're at all compelled to see this musical, I recommend this version. Great performances all around. If I had one criticism, it's that the director was too obsessed with the close up shots.

1000741,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000GAKLZI,Z Hayes,"[28, 30]","I've watched theater productions of Les Mis, watched screen adaptations, and read the book several times over, and this cinematic adaptation ranks highly on my list of adaptations. As a musical film, it is well put-together, utilizing a stellar cast who delivers compelling performances in both acting and singing, excellent set-up of scenes, credible costumes and sets making the period and setting of 19th century France come alive, and spectacular effects.I read some critical reviews which found the singing of the cast members to be less than impressive. I agree only with regards to three characters - Russell Crowe's Inspector Javert, and Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiers. Crowe's emoting as Javert was well done with his facial expressions credibly portraying his resolute nature and steadfast obsession in hunting Jean Valjean, but his singing just wasn't up to par although to be fair some of his songs were incredibly difficult. I felt an actor who had more of an established singingbackground would have fared much better in this role. The Thenardiers' portrayal did not sit well with me either - Cohen's and Helena Bonham Carter's singing performances were just plain awful.Now that I've got the criticisms out of the way, let me comment on the positives. Hugh Jackman blew me away with his performance - I avoided comparing his performance to the Broadway productions because they are two entirely different mediums. These actors had to sing live on set and Jackman's background in singing with his strong, commanding voice as well as his experience as an actor really served him well in the challenging role of lead character Jean Valjean. There were scenes where Valjean displays his inner conflict - the beginning when he is railing against the injustice of his imprisonment, the scene where he is praying and reflecting on the priest's kindness to him and how he experiences this epiphany of how to transform his life, later still when he has embraced a new identity and is prospering as the Mayor of a city and his turmoil when he finds Javert has been dispatched to work in his city, so much more, and all done with impeccable finesse. Even when his voice at times breaks during a performance, I found it compelling because this is how one would expect it to be in real life - emotions impacting one's voice (not that people go through life singing their emotions out all the time). It was heartbreaking, 'real', and did not feel put on at all. Jackman delivers an Oscar worthy performance and I hope he gets it.Fantine as portrayed by the beautiful and talented Anne Hathaway (I grew from a non-fan to a fan - starting from The Devil Wears Prada to the latest Batman and this) just broke my heart. That one song, ""I Dreamed A Dream"" was so achingly poignant and full of despair - this is a woman brought so low by life's circumstances and filled with despair - as I watched Fantine sing, I could only think, ""God, this is how I imagined Fantine when I read the book,"" so really, what more could be said. Hathaway embodies Fantine - her hopes, dashed dreams, and her despair with heartbreaking clarity.Amanda Seyfried as Cossette was lovely but I would not go so far as to say it was a spectacular performance but my, what a revelation Eddie Redmayne was as Marius. I've been a bit of a fan after watching him in My Week With Marilyn, and he is amazing here as the young revolutionary who is besotted with Cossette. His voice is compelling and his yearning and aching love for Cossette is credibly conveyed by his voice in song.Eponine as played by Samantha Barks was another favorite character who also broke my heart. Her songs, delivered with such sadness and yearning, and those haunting eyes just tugged at the heartstrings. The young actor who plays Gavroche, Daniel Huttlestone, the street urchin and young revolutionary in the making delivered a performance that is memorable for its sincerity and spiritedness.Though the movie is rather long in length at slightly over two and a half hours, I did not feel like the movie dragged at all. Each scene was carefully set up and orchestrated and the songs and dialogue all came together beautifully. When I heard that famous line, ""To love someone is to see the face of God"", I wept because that scene to me at least embodied what Hugo's work was all about. This is a beautiful cinematic masterpiece and I feel richer for having watched it.",5,Sublime cinematic adaptation,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,4442,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'theater', 'productions', 'Les', 'Mis', 'watched', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'read', 'book', 'several', 'times', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'ranks', 'highly', 'list', 'adaptations', 'musical', 'film', 'well', 'put-together', 'utilizing', 'stellar', 'cast', 'who', 'compelling', 'performances', 'acting', 'singing', 'excellent', 'set-up', 'scenes', 'credible', 'costumes', 'sets', 'making', 'period', 'setting', '19th', 'century', 'France', 'come', 'alive', 'spectacular', 'effects.I', 'read', 'critical', 'reviews', 'found', 'singing', 'cast', 'members', 'be', 'less', 'impressive', 'agree', 'only', 'regards', 'three', 'characters', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Inspector', 'Javert', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Thenardiers', 'Crowe', 'emoting', 'Javert', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'facial', 'expressions', 'credibly', 'portraying', 'resolute', 'nature', 'steadfast', 'obsession', 'hunting', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'singing', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'be', 'fair', 'songs', 'were', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'felt', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'more', 'established', 'singingbackground', 'would', 'have', 'fared', 'much', 'better', 'role', 'Thenardiers', 'portrayal', 'did', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'Cohen', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'singing', 'performances', 'were', 'just', 'plain', ""'ve"", 'got', 'criticisms', 'way', 'let', 'comment', 'positives', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'blew', 'away', 'performance', 'avoided', 'comparing', 'performance', 'Broadway', 'productions', 'are', 'two', 'entirely', 'different', 'mediums', 'actors', 'had', 'sing', 'live', 'set', 'Jackman', 'background', 'singing', 'strong', 'commanding', 'voice', 'as', 'well', 'experience', 'actor', 'really', 'served', 'well', 'challenging', 'role', 'lead', 'character', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'were', 'scenes', 'where', 'Valjean', 'inner', 'conflict', 'beginning', 'when', 'railing', 'injustice', 'imprisonment', 'scene', 'where', 'praying', 'reflecting', 'priest', 'kindness', 'how', 'epiphany', 'how', 'transform', 'life', 'later', 'still', 'when', 'embraced', 'new', 'identity', 'prospering', 'Mayor', 'city', 'turmoil', 'when', 'Javert', 'been', 'dispatched', 'work', 'city', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'done', 'impeccable', 'finesse', 'Even', 'when', 'voice', 'times', 'breaks', 'performance', 'found', 'compelling', 'how', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'emotions', 'impacting', 'one', 'voice', 'not', 'people', 'go', 'life', 'singing', 'emotions', 'time', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'put', 'Jackman', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'hope', 'it.Fantine', 'portrayed', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'grew', 'non-fan', 'fan', 'starting', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'latest', 'Batman', 'just', 'broke', 'heart', 'one', 'song', 'Dreamed', 'Dream', 'was', 'so', 'achingly', 'poignant', 'full', 'despair', 'woman', 'brought', 'so', 'low', 'life', 'circumstances', 'filled', 'despair', 'watched', 'Fantine', 'sing', 'could', 'only', 'think', 'God', 'how', 'imagined', 'Fantine', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'so', 'really', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Hathaway', 'Fantine', 'hopes', 'dashed', 'dreams', 'despair', 'heartbreaking', 'clarity.Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'Cossette', 'was', 'lovely', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'was', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'what', 'revelation', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'was', 'Marius', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bit', 'fan', 'watching', 'My', 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'amazing', 'here', 'young', 'revolutionary', 'who', 'besotted', 'Cossette', 'voice', 'compelling', 'yearning', 'aching', 'love', 'Cossette', 'credibly', 'conveyed', 'voice', 'song.Eponine', 'played', 'Samantha', 'Barks', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'who', 'also', 'broke', 'heart', 'songs', 'delivered', 'such', 'sadness', 'yearning', 'haunting', 'eyes', 'just', 'tugged', 'heartstrings', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'Gavroche', 'Daniel', 'Huttlestone', 'street', 'urchin', 'young', 'revolutionary', 'making', 'delivered', 'performance', 'memorable', 'sincerity', 'movie', 'rather', 'long', 'length', 'slightly', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'movie', 'dragged', 'scene', 'was', 'carefully', 'set', 'up', 'orchestrated', 'songs', 'dialogue', 'came', 'together', 'beautifully', 'When', 'heard', 'famous', 'line', 'love', 'someone', 'see', 'face', 'God', 'wept', 'scene', 'least', 'embodied', 'what', 'Hugo', 'work', 'was', 'about', 'beautiful', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'feel', 'richer', 'having', 'watched']",N/A
