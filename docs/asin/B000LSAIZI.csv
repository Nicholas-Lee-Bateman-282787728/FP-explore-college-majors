It has a lot of the same signs as Baby Signing Time and some different ones but its format is not as interesting to my daughter. At 14 months she did pick up new signs from this video and that is exciting. The hardest part is that we so enjoy the Signing Time series that watching this video is a bit of a let down.Things I like:Music/Pictures to draw baby's attentionNew signs for little oneClear Words visually and verballyDislike:Shows too many signs at once, confusing babyNo order to signsNo grouping to make it easier for baby to assimilate signs into daily worldI would recommend this video to young children. However, if your goal is to teach them how to sign I suggest you look into Signing Time and Baby Signing Time.",4,"On its own it is a good signing movie, does not hold up next to other products.",1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,846,"['daughter', 'signs', 'already', 'due', 'Signing', 'Time', 'Baby', 'Signing', 'Time', 'When', 'got', 'was', 'excited', 'let', 'down', 'lot', 'same', 'signs', 'Baby', 'Signing', 'Time', 'different', 'ones', 'format', 'not', 'interesting', 'daughter', '14', 'months', 'did', 'pick', 'up', 'new', 'signs', 'video', 'exciting', 'hardest', 'part', 'so', 'enjoy', 'Signing', 'Time', 'series', 'watching', 'video', 'bit', 'let', 'down.Things', 'like', 'Music/Pictures', 'draw', 'baby', 'attentionNew', 'signs', 'little', 'oneClear', 'Words', 'visually', 'verballyDislike', 'Shows', 'too', 'many', 'signs', 'once', 'confusing', 'babyNo', 'order', 'signsNo', 'grouping', 'make', 'easier', 'baby', 'assimilate', 'signs', 'daily', 'worldI', 'would', 'recommend', 'video', 'young', 'children', 'However', 'goal', 'teach', 'how', 'sign', 'suggest', 'look', 'Signing', 'Time', 'Baby', 'Signing', 'Time']",Baby Einstein - My First Signs

I wish there were more Sign Language DVD's in the Einstein series because this sort of leaves you hanging.  The search for DVD's between this age and schoolage where ettiquette, sentence structure, classifiers, etc. start to be discussed is void.  It would be nice if signing could be taken for granted and included in children's programing as a matter of course.  Our granddaughter does now look for hands to mean something and Signing seems to be a stronger language for her than verbal instruction.  She usually smiles when she signs to us because for her it seems to be both a game and powerful. ""Adults"" get it when she signs.  This DVD did make a huge difference getting her started.  We have a deaf daughter (25) so it is important in our family to have these materials around for everybody.

1040443,A10G4BPT5MGBHY,B000LSAIZI,Julie Neal,"[105, 111]","Here's the idea: a video for toddlers age 6 months and up that teaches them sign language, so they can communicate ""mommy,"" ""daddy,"" ""kiss,"" ""baby"" and ""I love you"" before they can talk. If that alone doesn't melt your heart -- if your mouse hasn't yet forced itself over to that ""Add to Shopping Cart"" button -- then here's a brief description of what you get.Hosted by Marlee Matlin, this sweet 30-minute video uses puppets, live-action video, stills and children to teach the signs for 20 words. The signs are easy to learn, as the videos really drive home their message. For each word, Matlin demonstrates a sign, then video images reinforce it. For example, for the word ""kiss"" a 30-second video shows a girl kissing her mom, a boy kissing his dad, another dad and son doing the sign together, a painting of a mom kissing her infant, then more video clips of moms and dads kissing their kids, then the sign again, then a boy kissing his big stuffed dog, then a girl kissing her grandmother, then a little girl kissing her doll's baby bunny! There is no narration, in fact no spoken dialogue at all except for the words themselves. Other words include ""cereal,"" ""milk,"" ""eat,"" ""drink,"" ""play,"" ""help,"" ""friend,"" ""ball,"" ""sleep,"" ""bath,"" ""story,"" ""blanket,"" ""please"" and ""thank you.""The production values are first-rate. Everything is well-lit and in focus; the clean sets are simple yet vibrant. And the sign language is the real deal: a combination of American Sign Language (ASL) and Conceptually Accurate Signed English.There's no Scene Selection, so you can't cherry-pick favorite words to play, but a two-minute bonus feature (Sign with Me) reviews them all, and Matlin appears on two one-minute features with some additional words (including ""happy,"" ""sad,"" ""potty,"" ""sorry"" and ""love""). Other bonus features include five cute puppet shows (three minutes total).All of these Baby Einstein videos are so good  -- so gentle, colorful and interactive, with nothing but positive messages -- that it's easy to forget that, technically, kids shouldn't be watching them. That the best way to promote ""proper brain development"" in kids under 2, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, is ""talking, playing, singing and reading together."" But during those times you can't be actively engaged with your child (let's see, that would include cooking, cleaning, laundry...) the series is a great way to give your rugrat a rewarding experience. Plus, you are supposed to be watching this WITH your child. And it's only 30 minutes (though the menu does include a ""Repeat Play"" option).Does it actually work? Absolutely, especially if you watch it together. Even if your child doesn't learn anything, you'll be there smiling at his or her happy little face, talking, playing and singing together... it's just what the doctor ordered!",5,Outstanding for infants and toddlers,1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,2836,"['Here', 'idea', 'video', 'toddlers', 'age', '6', 'months', 'up', 'sign', 'language', 'can', 'communicate', 'mommy', 'daddy', 'kiss', 'baby', 'love', 'can', 'talk', 'alone', ""n't"", 'melt', 'heart', 'mouse', ""n't"", 'yet', 'forced', 'Add', 'Shopping', 'Cart', 'button', 'then', 'here', 'brief', 'description', 'what', 'get.Hosted', 'Marlee', 'Matlin', 'sweet', '30-minute', 'video', 'puppets', 'live-action', 'video', 'stills', 'children', 'teach', 'signs', '20', 'words', 'signs', 'are', 'easy', 'learn', 'videos', 'really', 'drive', 'home', 'message', 'word', 'Matlin', 'sign', 'then', 'video', 'images', 'reinforce', 'example', 'word', 'kiss', '30-second', 'video', 'girl', 'kissing', 'mom', 'boy', 'kissing', 'dad', 'dad', 'son', 'doing', 'sign', 'together', 'painting', 'mom', 'kissing', 'infant', 'then', 'more', 'video', 'clips', 'moms', 'dads', 'kissing', 'kids', 'then', 'sign', 'again', 'then', 'boy', 'kissing', 'big', 'stuffed', 'dog', 'then', 'girl', 'kissing', 'grandmother', 'then', 'little', 'girl', 'kissing', 'doll', 'baby', 'bunny', 'narration', 'fact', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'words', 'Other', 'words', 'include', 'cereal', 'milk', 'eat', 'drink', 'play', 'help', 'friend', 'ball', 'sleep', 'bath', 'story', 'blanket', 'please', 'thank', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'first-rate', 'Everything', 'well-lit', 'focus', 'clean', 'sets', 'are', 'simple', 'yet', 'vibrant', 'sign', 'language', 'real', 'deal', 'combination', 'American', 'Sign', 'Language', 'ASL', 'Conceptually', 'Accurate', 'Signed', 'English.There', 'Scene', 'Selection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cherry-pick', 'favorite', 'words', 'play', 'two-minute', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Sign', 'Me', 'Matlin', 'two', 'one-minute', 'features', 'additional', 'words', 'including', 'happy', 'sad', 'potty', 'sorry', 'love', 'Other', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'five', 'cute', 'puppet', 'shows', 'three', 'minutes', 'total', '.All', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'videos', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'gentle', 'colorful', 'interactive', 'nothing', 'positive', 'messages', 'easy', 'forget', 'technically', 'kids', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'best', 'way', 'promote', 'proper', 'brain', 'development', 'kids', '2', 'according', 'American', 'Academy', 'Pediatrics', 'talking', 'playing', 'singing', 'reading', 'together', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'actively', 'engaged', 'child', 'let', 'see', 'would', 'include', 'cooking', 'cleaning', 'laundry', 'series', 'great', 'way', 'give', 'rugrat', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'watching', 'WITH', 'child', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'menu', 'include', 'Repeat', 'Play', 'option', 'actually', 'work', 'Absolutely', 'especially', 'watch', 'together', 'Even', 'child', ""n't"", 'learn', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there', 'smiling', 'happy', 'little', 'face', 'talking', 'playing', 'singing', 'together', 'just', 'what', 'doctor', 'ordered']",Baby Einstein - My First Signs

1040447,A2K6K2DUN6HIB0,B000LSAIZI,Rachael,"[0, 0]","The video covers simple words including eat, friend, mommy, daddy, play, sleep, ball, cereal, milk, drink, more, baby, blanket, and bath, stop, and go. After watching this twice in a row the first day and twice in a row the second day, my son said the words play and mommy and signed the word friend, for the first time! After his 5th time watching he was able to sign blanket and bath. My only complaint (and reason why it gets 4 stars) is that no one in the video is shown SAYING the words. This video uses an unseen narrator, so you do hear the word and see it written on the screen in nice big font, and see children and parents signing, which is wonderful. My son needs to read lips as well as hear the word. I understand this video used deaf children/parents, I just wish they had included at least one or two hearing people who could say the words with a close-up of their mouths. I ordered a baby babble dvd as well so hopefully that will help my son a little more with his specific needs. This is a great video for deaf or hearing kids to learn simple sign language, and it's one of the few videos my 21 month old will pay attention to (he prefers this to Sesame Street!). The way I use the video is I have my son sit in my lap and I move his hands and say the word when it appears on the screen. Sometimes his daddy sits in front of him and signs the word and says the word as well, so my son is able to see people on TV and up close signing the word, while having his hands moved in the correct way. This is an extremely effective method, I didn't expect the results to be so fast.
