DaVega ""pop culture historian""","[3, 3]","Me & Will is an excellent, vastly underrated movie, but this ""new"" 2008 version from Peace Arch Entertainment is a completely pointless dvd rerelease. It has nothing new added to it ; in fact, it has even fewer extra features than the 1999 release did. The only thing noticeably different is the newly revamped cover artwork image and title graphics (which now misleadingly make co-star Patrick Dempsey out to look like the star of the movie) and a retweaked picture which is now presented in a matted widescreen format. The image does look a little better but the sound is still mediocre and it's not enough to save this dvd. Like I say, I like the movie alot but it deserves better dvd treatment than it received here. Overall, I'm very dissappointed with this rerelease and will not be buying anything from Peace Arch again.Movie: A+DVD: F",1,Save Your Money.

There were a couple items I thought distracted from the plot and weakened the climax of a movie that had potential. The in-your-face drug use was excessive and the fact that every character was either a junky or a wife beater was just too cliched. And the climax of finding the Easy Rider bike is so lame, it voided the complete plot of the movie. And why can't a motorcycle movie be shot at a location where the rocky mountains isn't a constant backdrop? How about making a move about the Dragon's Tail in North Carolina or Route 66 or anywhere but California?

I saw it on vhs at the time and didn't know it was on dvd. But lo and behold there it was. It was a spinoff of Easy Rider, a classic I might add. And this one possibly in the same class of Easy Rider, in the years to come.
