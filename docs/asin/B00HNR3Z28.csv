Instead, this engaging film present a humanistic philosophical perspective that focuses on an idealistic premise.  The story is both well thought out, and capably acted.  This is a wonderful film for a thinking person.  The scenery, costumes, acting, and pace are outstanding.",4,A Conqueror's Different Side,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,407,"['expected', 'film', 'would', 'include', 'military', 'strategy', 'battles', 'intrigue', 'often', 'maligned', 'massacres', 'Mongol', 'hordes', 'Instead', 'engaging', 'film', 'present', 'humanistic', 'philosophical', 'perspective', 'idealistic', 'premise', 'story', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'capably', 'acted', 'wonderful', 'film', 'thinking', 'person', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'acting', 'pace', 'are', 'outstanding']",Kingdom Of Conquerors Digital
1691210,A1Z7HE1UO6KXGW,B00HNR3Z28,Kenneth Harrigan,"[0, 0]",This is not the action packed type of film about Genghis Khan that I thought it would be but it was still very entertaining. The film covers some of the last days of Khan and the wise man that changed his life. There was some well done action for the folks like me (could have been more). It is the acting and storyline that will have me watching this film for years to come.,4,Good Story,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,375,"['not', 'action', 'packed', 'type', 'film', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'last', 'days', 'Khan', 'wise', 'man', 'changed', 'life', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'action', 'folks', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'acting', 'storyline', 'will', 'have', 'watching', 'film', 'years', 'come']",Kingdom Of Conquerors Digital

Instead they made this...I am almost at a loss for what to call it. Some Buddhist Gandhi type character trying to convince a total Bad Ass  like Genghis Khan that his entire life's ambition & conquering the known world was all a big mistake!!! And now that your like 112 years old you should change your ways and seek out peace & harmony???  WOW looks like somebody missed the boat on this one!!!!!  I thought, Great we are finally going to get the story of the greatest warrior ever known done by his ancestors & portrayed by some awesome Chinese actors instead of John Wayne!!! But alas I was wrong & I am stuck watching &#34;The Conqueror&#34; Howard Hughes's guilty pleasure starring John Wayne as Genghis Khan. A movie that was filmed in a radio active zone that is probably responsible for the majority of the cast dying of cancer!!!!  So if you are like me & thinking this is going to be a plethora of ass kicking action worthy of the greatest warrior the world has ever seen, you will be disappointed!!!!  On the other hand if you would like to think of Genghis Khan as feeling totally guilty for conquering more of the world than Alexander the Great & bringing culture & unequivocal success to his people...well  then this is for you!",3,It fell short of my expectations!,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,1471,"['Man', 'when', 'look', 'movies', '34', 'Red', 'Cliff', '34', '34', 'Warlords', '34', 'think', 'what', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'accomplished', 'looking', 'potential', 'international', 'monster', 'epic', 'action', 'would', 'be', 'off', 'charts', 'Instead', 'made', 'am', 'almost', 'loss', 'what', 'call', 'Buddhist', 'Gandhi', 'type', 'character', 'trying', 'convince', 'total', 'Bad', 'Ass', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'entire', 'life', 'ambition', 'conquering', 'known', 'world', 'was', 'big', 'mistake', 'now', '112', 'years', 'old', 'should', 'change', 'ways', 'seek', 'out', 'peace', 'harmony', 'WOW', 'somebody', 'missed', 'boat', 'one', 'thought', 'Great', 'are', 'finally', 'going', 'get', 'story', 'greatest', 'warrior', 'ever', 'known', 'done', 'ancestors', 'portrayed', 'awesome', 'Chinese', 'actors', 'instead', 'John', 'Wayne', 'alas', 'was', 'wrong', 'am', 'stuck', 'watching', '34', 'Conqueror', '34', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'starring', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'radio', 'active', 'zone', 'probably', 'responsible', 'majority', 'cast', 'dying', 'cancer', 'So', 'are', 'thinking', 'going', 'be', 'plethora', 'ass', 'kicking', 'action', 'worthy', 'greatest', 'world', 'ever', 'seen', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'other', 'hand', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'feeling', 'totally', 'guilty', 'conquering', 'more', 'world', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'bringing', 'culture', 'unequivocal', 'success', 'people', 'well', 'then']",Kingdom Of Conquerors Digital
