I can see why he oftentimes partners with Ricky Gervais because they both look at the world in an uncompromising, self-centered and arrogant way which often leaves me squirming and hoping to the heavens that I never have or will act that way.

Merchant never lets his character, Stuart, deal with his vulnerabilities with anything but thoughtlessness and sometimes, meanness.  He blunders his way through life dishing out cruelty and rudeness.  There's not one single thing that his character does that  makes him someone I'd want to know.

Plenty of super awkward scenes and plenty of scenes that will surprise and make you laugh uncontrollably. Unfortunately, think I see why this show ultimately was canceled, same reason I won't rewatch. Ultimately its too said. While Gervais was a jerk and always sticking his foot in his mouth in BBC office, at end of day, even when you began to feel a little sorry for him he would do something extra terrible and then you would laugh and not feel sorry for him in the least. In this show, you've got essentially a very likeable character that keeps getting the shaft. Hard to take after awhile. Maybe if they had some other subplot that was positive offsetting it like the Tim + whatever her name was :)Some of the ideas presented in this show were first rate, and that was only in the couple episodes I saw. I liked the &#34;AG&#34; concept his friend comes up with which is hilarious.
