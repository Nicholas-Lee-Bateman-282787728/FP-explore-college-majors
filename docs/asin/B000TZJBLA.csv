1092717,A19741DISGKEVQ,B000TZJBLA,"Dizzy Dean ""Mumps""","[2, 5]","There is a bit of anger among viewers regarding the utter failure of TT to have a satifying ending. Or ANY ending. I was there, I was in the same boat, right at the most climactic moment...nothing. Wtf!1Geneon has since gone out of business; unless the lic goes to another co, thats it. Solution ? MANGA! Want to find out the end ? TT is really involved and continues! (not a del rey review, no comment on the sanitized vers.).The anime is one of my faves still. Animation is crisp and with great colour, want a female voice to sound half-way normal ? TT. Deep involved story thats part Mystic, part Feudal Japan yet part now Japan ? TT.TT is not perfect, the fan service is minimal imo, but after the first ep. I didnt really notice it; it can get a bit long in some spots and the ""flashbacks"" may cause some lack of focus, but over all the story and quality far out weigh and failures.Do I wish TT had actually had a conclusion ? YES!. Do I think the manga had issues ? yes.Do I regret finding TT ?

1092718,A3FMVDJU5TOHOH,B000TZJBLA,Mike G,"[1, 2]","This dvd wasn't all that great it has some cool scenes and is not as sci fi based anime as most its more of knowledge and spiritel type powers and abilities. Giving it a edge of wonder and whats going to happen. The thing is the ending is too open, I SEEM TO JUST GET EVEN MORE ENTRESTING MORE POWER MORE SCI FI then it ended like whaaaa. This just left my mouth hanging looking for another cd. unfortunitly at this time they stoped making this series . Which most people son't understand it cost money to keep it going and with out a certain type from this fan and ratings it goes down the drain. MAYBE it was the advertising of this series or what not but who knows. IT HAS A twist with a girl being upsessed with the main charecter. unforinitly her sister is fine and the main charecter is more in to her because of her persenality and power. There really isn't even a strong plot of this anime every thing is more of a mystery. IT was a good beginning set up that could have been better but good enough to catch a little entrest. This ok anime but not the best so I gave it a mid star rating. arts great and it had some quiality of ideas.",3,This is ok,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,1142,"['dvd', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'cool', 'scenes', 'not', 'sci', 'fi', 'based', 'anime', 'most', 'more', 'knowledge', 'spiritel', 'type', 'powers', 'abilities', 'Giving', 'edge', 'wonder', 'whats', 'going', 'happen', 'thing', 'ending', 'too', 'open', 'SEEM', 'TO', 'JUST', 'GET', 'EVEN', 'MORE', 'ENTRESTING', 'MORE', 'POWER', 'MORE', 'SCI', 'FI', 'then', 'ended', 'whaaaa', 'just', 'left', 'mouth', 'hanging', 'looking', 'cd', 'unfortunitly', 'time', 'stoped', 'making', 'series', 'Which', 'most', 'people', 'so', ""n't"", 'understand', 'cost', 'money', 'keep', 'going', 'out', 'certain', 'type', 'fan', 'ratings', 'down', 'drain', 'MAYBE', 'was', 'advertising', 'series', 'what', 'not', 'who', 'IT', 'twist', 'girl', 'being', 'upsessed', 'main', 'charecter', 'unforinitly', 'sister', 'fine', 'main', 'charecter', 'more', 'persenality', 'power', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'strong', 'plot', 'anime', 'thing', 'more', 'mystery', 'IT', 'was', 'good', 'beginning', 'set', 'up', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'good', 'enough', 'catch', 'little', 'entrest', 'ok', 'anime', 'not', 'best', 'so', 'gave', 'mid', 'star', 'rating', 'arts', 'great', 'had', 'quiality', 'ideas']",Tenjho Tenge: Complete Collection
1092719,AFV2584U13XP3,B000TZJBLA,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[3, 10]",AS I said an a earlier review this is probably one of the few animes I trulydisliked.  I got this on my b-day and I appreciate my friend for getting me a gift but when I saw what it was I knew I had to put it somewhere I couldn't see it.  My friends after a few days decided they wanted to see some of the show so I brought it out and played the set if I disliked it with just the two dvds I bought earlier I truly despised it now.  The main reason is during the show there is a relationship between brother and sister that borders on incest while I never bothered to check the rest of the series out to see if they did anything more on that just seeing that little piece of it was enough to exchange this set for something else.  The voice actors aren't bad or anything but it's just again I felt that there was way to much fan-service and near hentai scenes that I was wondering if this wasn't an anime porno series.  The fight scenes are pretty good I give you that but I will tell viewers if you are looking for anything else in a anime series check out something else.,1,Appreciate The B-Day gift But Truly Wish For Something Else,1210982400,"05 17, 2008",2008,1073,"['said', 'earlier', 'review', 'probably', 'one', 'few', 'animes', 'trulydisliked', 'got', 'b-day', 'appreciate', 'friend', 'getting', 'gift', 'when', 'saw', 'what', 'was', 'knew', 'had', 'put', 'somewhere', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'My', 'few', 'days', 'decided', 'wanted', 'see', 'show', 'so', 'brought', 'out', 'played', 'set', 'disliked', 'just', 'two', 'dvds', 'bought', 'earlier', 'truly', 'despised', 'now', 'main', 'reason', 'show', 'relationship', 'brother', 'sister', 'incest', 'never', 'bothered', 'check', 'rest', 'series', 'see', 'did', 'anything', 'more', 'just', 'seeing', 'little', 'piece', 'was', 'enough', 'exchange', 'set', 'something', 'else', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'anything', 'just', 'again', 'felt', 'was', 'way', 'much', 'fan-service', 'hentai', 'scenes', 'was', 'wondering', 'was', ""n't"", 'anime', 'porno', 'series', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'give', 'will', 'tell', 'viewers', 'are', 'looking', 'anything', 'else', 'anime', 'series', 'check', 'something', 'else']",Tenjho Tenge: Complete Collection
1092720,A1ASGRO3X620BD,B000TZJBLA,T. Smith,"[34, 37]","This series has some good moments, but the storytelling is lumpy (a seven episode flashback?) and the internal logic is really sloppy.However, the deal breaker is that it doesn't end--it simply stops.  This is not an exaggeration.  When I got the the end of disk 8, I went to the box to get the next one...and there wasn't one.  It just...stops.  Right before the Big Climax.Unacceptable!Seriously, this is like going to a movie and having the last reel missing.  You can't win either way--either you like the series, in which case you'll feel robbed by the ""ending,"" or it's not something you'll like, in which case why buy it?So I recommend you save your money until the alleged next series comes out to complete the story.
