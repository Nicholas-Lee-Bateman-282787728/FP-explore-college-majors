1207950,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B001KF6F8U,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[6, 6]","The dating experience for NYC gay men is a ""Whirlwind"" (2007) of players, a compulsion to be judged as ""hot,"" manipulative jerks, and missed opportunities ... at least as it is portrayed in this commendable gay indie film, which won several audience awards at gay film festivals.It features a solid cast of actors, many with Broadway stage credits, who come together to realistically portray a diverse group of thirty-something gay men, along with assorted ""straight but not shallow"" friends. Likely the characters were written to be stereotypes of a sort intentionally, to assure the viewer would be able to identify with at least one or two of them.  There's the monogamous gay couple, having some problems with maturity and responsibility, and a handsome and personable guy who seems to have an aversion to dating the same guy twice. Add in a quiet man who has still not ""moved on"" from the sudden death of his partner in an auto accident two years before, and then there's the likeable but plain guy who keeps asking his friends for advice on how to better live his life. The dynamics of this closeknit group of friends is strained by a handsome newcomer, an event planner at local bars, who feeds on others' insecurities and manipulates them for his own amusement.Although very well acted and directed, the situations seemed way too contrived to me, and best I can give it is four stars out of five.  The DVD includes director commentary, a video of the actors' first table read, and a behind-the-scenes slide show.",4,"A bit contrived, but a well-acted look at NYC gay dating scene",1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,1520,"['dating', 'experience', 'NYC', 'gay', 'men', 'Whirlwind', '2007', 'players', 'compulsion', 'be', 'judged', 'hot', 'manipulative', 'jerks', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'least', 'portrayed', 'commendable', 'gay', 'indie', 'film', 'won', 'several', 'audience', 'awards', 'gay', 'film', 'festivals.It', 'solid', 'cast', 'actors', 'many', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'credits', 'who', 'come', 'together', 'realistically', 'portray', 'diverse', 'group', 'thirty-something', 'gay', 'men', 'assorted', 'straight', 'not', 'shallow', 'friends', 'Likely', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'be', 'stereotypes', 'sort', 'intentionally', 'assure', 'viewer', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'monogamous', 'gay', 'couple', 'having', 'problems', 'maturity', 'responsibility', 'handsome', 'personable', 'guy', 'who', 'have', 'aversion', 'dating', 'same', 'guy', 'twice', 'Add', 'quiet', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'not', 'moved', 'sudden', 'death', 'partner', 'auto', 'accident', 'two', 'years', 'then', 'likeable', 'plain', 'guy', 'who', 'asking', 'friends', 'advice', 'how', 'better', 'live', 'life', 'dynamics', 'closeknit', 'group', 'friends', 'strained', 'handsome', 'newcomer', 'event', 'planner', 'local', 'bars', 'who', 'others', 'insecurities', 'own', 'amusement.Although', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'situations', 'seemed', 'way', 'too', 'contrived', 'best', 'can', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'five', 'DVD', 'director', 'commentary', 'video', 'actors', 'first', 'table', 'read', 'behind-the-scenes', 'slide', 'show']",Whirlwind

And instead it's a nice comedy, with a tinge of drama, but not too much, with nice characters, and without much angst.

1207953,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B001KF6F8U,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[2, 2]","This film constantly offers, tantalisingly, more than it delivers visually as filmed with perhaps all too much restraint, but ""Whirlwind"" is a potently sexy video, for all of that. Reviews and descriptions elsewhere on the WWW give a very good idea of the plot and character motivations that drive ""Whirlwind"", and I refer those who want to know more of that to such descriptions and reviews elsewhere on ""The ""Web"". I would add simply that, for all its merits, this film (like so many others from the Wolfe Video and Pride labels) has the feel and production values of television. It comes across rather as an extended ""gay sit-com"".For those for whom David Rudd (Drake) draws a sharp intake of breath for the teasingly (and potently) sexual arousal (but pants-on) that the photo on the DVD's front box cover (of Drake staring at himself in a mirror) can evoke, it should be noted that there really is not much nudity that would reveal more of Rudd's splendidly virile physique; even that cover photo does not correspond to any specific moment of what the viewer sees of David Rudd in the film.Rudd's Drake has some very torrid embraces with other good-looking men here and there (not all of them members of the intimate friendship group the portrayal of which is the centre of interest in the film), kissing them passionately, as Drake so locks lips in hearty lust with nearly any man in whom this cynical sensualist takes an interest. During such moments, even the shirtless views of Rudd's potent and hirsute male beauty are few and only partially revealing. Neither is there any truly full-frontal nudity of any others of the film's actors, some of whom are quite attractive. More male nudity, tastefully handled, in a film with this kind of plot could have been quite appropriate. However, there is enough glimpsed to make the viewer understand just how such a cunning, stunningly gorgeous, and powerfully sexy man as Drake (Rudd) can succeed in seducing, not only through devious psychological manipulation, but also so many of them outright sexually, the gay men in the friendship circle which Drake sets out to disband.Recommendable for those who are content with modest (but good) production values. I am gettig used to thinking of most Wolfe productions as ""gay TV movies"" (good ones) rather than as full-fledged, glamourously cinematic productions.

Very good use of Jazz throughout the film and played in the appropriate places. The story is very solid. What I most liked is the nature of the friendships of the characters. What better set of friends to have than those who know you best, flaws and all, can tell you what they are and criticize you for them, offer suggestions, and still love you warts and all. That kind of thing doesn't happen very often.  But as one of the protagonists says, ""you are my family"".The interesting thing about the guy who stirs up the whirlwind to deal with his own failed relationship, is that he will probably end up some years in the future as ""one tired old queen"", the dashing looks a thing of the past, replaced by someone gone way over the hill and rolling down to the bottom, and still not have a clue how he got there!  And the friends and the women in their lives, still very much in the present.I found it a bit disconcerting that the ""gang"" seemed really isolated in the film. But then again, big city life can be like that and being a minority tends to breing people together for safety and fusion. It would have been interesting to see how the two African-American friends in the group saw their identities being black, or whether that even played a role in who they were.I would like the players in the film to redue the film in about 10-15 years to see where they were emotionally, and mentally as they had matured.All in all, a great cast, plugged into a compelling script, done up very well.",5,A good feeling to be able to give  a five star rating for a little independant movie,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,1591,"['were', 'many', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'most', 'noticible', 'Very', 'good', 'use', 'Jazz', 'film', 'played', 'appropriate', 'places', 'story', 'very', 'solid', 'What', 'most', 'liked', 'nature', 'friendships', 'characters', 'What', 'better', 'set', 'friends', 'have', 'who', 'know', 'best', 'flaws', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'are', 'criticize', 'offer', 'suggestions', 'still', 'love', 'warts', 'kind', 'thing', ""n't"", 'happen', 'very', 'often', 'one', 'protagonists', 'are', 'family', '.The', 'interesting', 'thing', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'whirlwind', 'deal', 'own', 'failed', 'relationship', 'will', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'years', 'future', 'one', 'tired', 'old', 'queen', 'dashing', 'thing', 'past', 'replaced', 'someone', 'gone', 'way', 'hill', 'rolling', 'down', 'bottom', 'still', 'not', 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'friends', 'women', 'lives', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'present.I', 'found', 'bit', 'disconcerting', 'gang', 'seemed', 'really', 'isolated', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'big', 'city', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'being', 'minority', 'breing', 'people', 'together', 'safety', 'fusion', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'two', 'African-American', 'friends', 'group', 'saw', 'identities', 'being', 'black', 'even', 'played', 'role', 'who', 'were.I', 'would', 'like', 'players', 'film', 'redue', 'film', '10-15', 'years', 'see', 'where', 'were', 'emotionally', 'mentally', 'had', 'matured.All', 'great', 'cast', 'plugged', 'compelling', 'script', 'done', 'up', 'very', 'well']",Whirlwind
