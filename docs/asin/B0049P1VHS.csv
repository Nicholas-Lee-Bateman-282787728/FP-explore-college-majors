Anderson ""ann0314""","[2, 3]","I don't do reviews that go episode by episode as I feel there are others that do that so much better then me so I'm instead going to discuss what this series ""adds"" to the classic horror genre.If you go into this wanting ""horror"" made for TV, you will be disappointed as this is not necessarily a ""scary"" TV show for someone who has seen movies like 28 Days Later, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead etc. (It would be scary for those who possibly don't watch this genre normally or younger children though) This series is honestly a far cry from those types of movies and to me is closer to something like Stephen King's The Stand in feel. The filming is done with the people at the center of the series rather then the zombies and follows them as they decide how to live in and cope with a world where the dead walk. If you are someone who is into films or television with an Apocalyptic type theme, you should really enjoy this series as it does get you thinking of how you would respond and what you would do in these circumstances. The filming is generally gritty and was very well done and does put you into the middle of what the people are going through and that combined with a wonderful cast that really draws you in is what makes this really special. All in all, a great compliment to the genre, intelligent, thought provoking and well written.

1389524,AHNYRCBNPYS9P,B0049P1VHS,AeroEngineer,"[2, 5]","C grade.Just OK basic cable show with a few too many unbelievable plot holes and cliched zombie situations. Good if you're bored and just want to plop down and turn off your brain, you know be a zombie.1. A police officer or any other intelligent person(SOME PO's are intelligent) would have the basic logic that if millions of former humans are now rabid killer zombies then DON'T go to where there WERE large amounts of people clustered together i.e. cities. That's obviously where most zombies will be. DUH! I can see the logic of staying NEAR cities for their large stocks of non perishable food and other items but to march into a city is just beyond the pale. Lazy contrived story writing, ugh!2. Cliched zombie survivor story. In almost every zombie story there are a group of survivors who are bullied by one or two angry males, almost always southern white males. Geez could these writers be any more typical than the countless entertainment workers I encounter here in Los Angeles. Believe me they are a tribe with their conformist PC ways and views that are easy to spot in mass market entertainment. Most of us don't even know that much and how much our views are shaped by these people. The clearest illustration is the current metro based Democratic party.3. Annoying product placement. Oh that Dodge Charger scene was so obnoxious, now if fuel was limited and you didn't want to get in a car crash no matter what you would not go tearing full speed anywhere, but they have to get more and more revenue from both the paying audience and commercials AND in show placement, ugh. Not to mention the silly CDC part, that too would be the last place to go because EVERYONE else would go there too.4. Annoying PC character balancing so everyone can relate! Plenty of feel good revenge scenes, black man leaving racist angry white man behind to be eaten, everyone is ""god"" fearing appropriate level of morality, PC kindness, abused wife does the final killing of violent husband turned zombie, etc. etc. The hospital for the elderly is protected by our friendly Latino gang, very silly and contrived. In an apocalypse survival situation none of this would happen, we'd go back to survival of the strongest period. You can barely walk through a dept. store without feeling the anger/alienation even now.5. Plot holes. How could a character chained up suddenly out of nowhere find a hacksaw? Why would he use it on his hand rather than on the handcuffs? This is just silly. The tanks in the show would have had blood/body parts all over them including all of the cars, etc. They were clean as new here. Almost everything is burned out, why weren't the zombies also burned dead with the flames? The writers do so much to just string along a story in so many situations.Now granted I am an engineer so I can see so much more wrong with the logic and realism than most but come on!Zombies would be easy to immobilize in reality with our mechanized technology and number of technically educated people. You don't need to waste bullets firing on something that is just crawling along like in one scene. Simply mounting saws on the sides of a moving vehicle would cut their legs off effectively killing them or using airplanes to drop acid to burn them up, if they die from starvation then it would only be a matter of time anyways if they only eat flesh. Just run them over with a truck or car or tank, etc etc.Heck set the whole city on fire or herd them into an enclosed fire proof place to get rid of them, duh! Herding them into a slaughtering plant or other ambush point and putting a heated wire at the neck level or leg level would take care of it too, etc. etc etc. Contrived and idiotic writing is what you get with the majority of advertising based shows though.From what I'm reading Season 2 is not as good as season 1, wow I'll skip this series here and now.",3,C level stuff.

1389525,A32O98PFC3OP7K,B0049P1VHS,A Gamer at Heart,"[0, 1]","This AMC series is based on a graphic novel series that follows a group of people trying to survive the end of civilization due to a zombie apocalypse. The time frame is largely immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travels and drama surrounding the survivors. The story largely focuses on how the survivors live in this now non-technological world, hiding from zombies who are constantly searching for a food source (i.e., people, animals). As the group travels the road, they run into other groups of survivors who have banded together, sometimes good, sometimes evil. Because the show is put together by AMC, it is has high quality actors and is well written. It is really a drama that involves zombies more than a zombie show that happens to have characters. The characters in the Walking Dead are fully flushed out and complex with differing motives and objectives. It reminds me a bit of Battlestar Galactica on the Sci-Fi channel, where the characters and the story took precedence over the setting.This was the most highly anticipated series in my household, as we are huge fans of post-apocalyptic fiction. My wife and I watched it first to make sure that it was appropriate for tweens/teens (16, 13 & 12), and then went back and watched with the kids (I admit, we let them see violence and gore, but no inappropriate sex/nudity). The kids love the show as much as we do, but it is not for those with a weak stomach or the faint of heart. We are watching the second season now, and it is every bit as good as the first season.

This is easily one of my favorite shows on any network, and it's gloriously gory in HD.If you haven't seen the show, you owe it to yourself to watch, especially in HD.  The sense of loneliness and stillness is constant.  There are tons of zombies, but they are probably the smallest part of this show.  Instead, it's how these survivors react to the zombies that will keep you coming back.  Another great thing about this show is that there is very little musical score to it.  This makes the show very quiet and still.  You can hear every footstep and every breathe which gets your heart racing because you don't know how close the next horde is or if they will be able to hear those footsteps.After reading the comic books (which are excellent), it's safe to say that these are a departure.  There are some similarities and most of the time I knew approximately what was going to happen, but it also threw some screw balls at me which kept it from being boring.If you're on the fence about buying this, just do it.

Great, taut writing that is thrilling and unpredictable.  At first, when I heard it was coming out on TV (not on HBO), I was immediately suspicious.  American TV has very strange rules, as are American sensibilities.  We can see all the gore and violence we want, but show a boob or say f--k, and many Americans' ears and eyes begin to bleed.  A strange dichotomy, to be sure, but there is a lot of all of these elements in the book, as well as some very extreme situations that I thought would not translate well to the small screen.It turns out my fears were unfounded.  AMC was able to take a great book (for more info, see my or other reviews on the compendium) and make a truly great show.  The focus is still there; that is, the main characters are what is important, not the zombies.  They are almost incidental to what is going on.  They just frame the situations the characters must face, and that is the true genius of the story.But something else I found great about the TV show is that it does not slavishly follow the source material, changing it subtly in places, drastically in others, to create an all-new entertainment experience that rivets me to the tube every week.  If you read the book, it is a good introduction to the show and vice-versa.  But what is great is if you liked one, you only get the outline for the other.  You get two great experiences.The extras on tacked on and like most DVD extras, are totally dumb and unnecessary.  Mostly, it is just people in the cast, crew and writers congratulating each other on how great it is as a story and how wonderful it is to work with each other.  Honestly, I can only see this so much until it makes me throw up.  Tell me interesting stories in making it, obstacles you had to overcome, the adversity of making the show.  None of these productions are harmonious in nature or smooth in execution.  I want to know the hiccups and travails.  THAT, ultimately, is what is interesting.  But the show is really why we buy these things, so get it and be prepared to be wowed.One last thing, do NOT show to children.

1389554,A3MHWG1OWOQMPG,B0049P1VHS,art lewis,"[2, 3]",".I have enjoyed this show because I hanker now and then for good zombie- and post-apocalypse stories.  And this show delivers pretty well on those counts.That's why I tolerate the sometimes terrible writing.  Without giving away anything important, I'll give an example.  During one episode in one of the three seasons I've watched, there is a very small town of fifty or sixty survivors who have managed to set up a good perimeter to keep out the zombies and get back a semblance of half-decent living.  An old man in the community is about to die from cancer, and has volunteered for an experiment.  After he dies, he will be restrained and allowed to turn into a zombie (sort of an undead, human-flesh-eating ghoul).  Running the experiment is a person who seems to be sort of bookish and nerdy -- perhaps he was a technician or researcher of some sort before the apocalypse -- he will test the old-man-become-zombie to see if the zombie can remember anything from the old man's life.  They want to see if there is anything human left in the unconscious mind of the zombie. Okay, so, old man dies.  They put restraints on him.  The corpse turns to zombie, starts growling.  The researcher asks a question to the zombie. So far so good.  I have no problem with the plot so far.Next, the zombie moves his hands in the restraints, tries to lift his mouth to bite the researcher.  The researcher now turns to the other person in the room and says -- ""We've got to take off the restraints!  We've paralyzed his mind!"" And quickly undoes the arm restraints.  (I won't give away what happens next, and it's not relevant to my point.)I'm sorry, but do the writers really take their audience to be that stupid?  Or is it the writers who are stupid? Consider.  The bookish nerdy techie guy knows that if he is bitten, he will have to be quickly killed, because once bitten, you soon turn into a zombie raring to eat people alive.  The bookish nerdy techie knows very well how dangerous zombies are.  He knows how they behave.  The whole of life revolves around surviving in the face of zombies.  But suddenly, he gets the brilliant idea to demand that the restraints be taken off immediately, because he believes that will allow the zombie to better communicate.  Furthermore, the techie doesn't want to even think it over, or try to discuss it.  No, he rushes to remove the restraints, and not with a ten foot pole, but close enough so the zombie might be able to take a bite out of him.  The other person in the room tries to intervene and demand that the techie guy not remove the restraints, but techie guy just doesn't have even a minute to stop and consider whether removing the restraints is really a good idea.Now, that is so far from believable it's actually annoying to watch.  Obviously the writers just wanted an excuse for something scary to happen.  I'm fine with scary, but not if it only happens through idiotic writing.  Can't the writers find a better way to get where they want to go?  One way the writers could have sort of saved the scene, perhaps:  if the second person in the room, observing the techie rushing to remove the restraints, responded in part by screaming in shock, ""Are you out of your mind?  Are you a total idiot?!!!""  Then if it turned out the techie guy indeed had a screw loose or was a moron, the scene would make some sense.But the scene did not make sense, it was just stupid.  Now, imagine such unbelievable stupidities proliferating like the zombies in the show.  I realize that the whole premise of the show is strictly speaking unbelievable fantasy -- but good fiction often makes the unbelievable plausible -- that's part of the fun of it.  One chooses willfully to suspend one's disbelief, because the thing is well-enough done to enchant.  But it's hard to suspend one's disbelief if a story virtually shouts at you ""hey, look how idiotically unbelievable this writing is!""I sometimes enjoy emotional or sentimental drama, so long as it's at least somewhat intelligent, but one reason I gave this show only three stars is because, at certain points -- I don't recall whether this started in the first season, or the second season, thankfully the third season does relatively little of this -- the characters get into the most annoyingly unbelievable -- especially given the whole zombie context -- pointlessly emotional conflict scenes that make no sense or make sense only by the primitive logic of bad writing.  This makes one start to revile some of the characters for their non-sensical emotions and behavior given the situation.  The conflicts tended to go on for a tortuously extended period.  The emptily intense dialogue, perhaps particularly between the main character and his wife, was sometimes almost impossible to endure, both tedious and provocatively stupid at once (at least in the second season).  I found myself hoping the wife would get eaten by a zombie.  I don't blame the actress.  The writers (and directors?) have so frequently invested her with false and idiotic emotions and intensity, to the extent that you can't look at her face anymore, because it so embodies the aspect of the show that is so annoyingly stupid.But despite the sometimes terrible writing, this show is still definitely very much worth a gander if you like zombie-post-apocalypse stuff.  The fact that this show is fun despite the sometimes terrible writing is a testimony to the power of post-apocalyptic zombie mythology.",3,"Fun zombie story, but the writing is sometimes annoyingly

I think it's a real measure of how much series television has improved over the last 15 years or so that a show like this, which probably would have blown me away had it come out in 1995 or so, now merely strikes me as significantly above average. On the whole it's a solid show, although I find there is an overreliance on foreshadowing that is counterproductive to the effects one should be trying to achieve in the horror/thriller genre. Having said that, I must commend the creators on putting together a great-looking series with credible performances and artful dialogue.

I spoke with a friend who loves this series because she is constantly surprised by it.  I think the difference between us is that I cut my teeth on the horror genre whereas she never watched any horror films.It really only surprised me in two ways.  First, by its retro portrayal of women who mainly cook and do laundry, squeak in fright, and need rescuing by manly men.  I would have expected this from the 1950s, but that this is produced today is really quite surprising.  The only female character who opts for a more independent role is shown as a ridiculous, desperate wanna-be.  Even the abused wife character is given more dignity than she is.Lots of character discussion about the incapacity of the women characters with firearms.  The writers are apparently unaware that Gallup reports that 43% of women say there is a gun in the home and 23% of women personally own one. Those figures would be higher in the South, where this series takes place.  In fact, the series' treatment of firearms in general is just peculiar, self-conscious, and occasionally factually wrong, as if the writers don't know anything about firearms or know anyone who owns one, but they read about it in a book. For those of us who live in parts of the country where gun ownership is common, guns are an unremarkable part of life and not the subject of a ton of awkward discussion and odd fascination.But this is the second surprise, which is silly writing.  The main character walks past acres of stalled cars with his jerrycan to a gas station to fill it, instead of siphoning gas from any of the cars he passed.  (Siphoning does finally show up in a later episode.)  Characters are blissfully overjoyed at having hot water, apparently never having figured out that they can heat water over their fire as much of the world currently does.  All the men effortlessly make head shot after head shot on zombies, whereas in the real world headshots on a moving target are pretty hard to make.  One character points a gun at another and the sound of a racking slide has been dubbed in that has nothing to do with what is going on visually.  Major explosions happen nearby and nobody has hearing loss. Loud noises attract zombies but only one character uses a bow and the rest use firearms without suppressors.  Etc etc.  Now given that I have agreed to suspend disbelief long enough to believe in zombies, these might seem like minor quibbles.  But the first rule of good fantasy/science fiction is that you have to take your world seriously or the reader won't either . . . and this one just can't get into it.",3,Predictable and sometimes silly zombie series,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,2738,"['Heavy', 'handed', 'predictable', 'series', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'must', 'survive', 'wake', 'pandemic', 'most', 'world', 'zombies', 'spoke', 'friend', 'who', 'series', 'constantly', 'surprised', 'think', 'difference', 'cut', 'teeth', 'horror', 'genre', 'never', 'watched', 'horror', 'films.It', 'really', 'only', 'surprised', 'two', 'ways', 'First', 'retro', 'portrayal', 'women', 'who', 'mainly', 'cook', 'do', 'laundry', 'squeak', 'fright', 'need', 'rescuing', 'manly', 'men', 'would', 'have', 'expected', '1950s', 'produced', 'today', 'really', 'quite', 'surprising', 'only', 'female', 'character', 'who', 'more', 'independent', 'role', 'shown', 'ridiculous', 'desperate', 'wanna-be', 'Even', 'abused', 'wife', 'character', 'given', 'more', 'dignity', 'is.Lots', 'character', 'discussion', 'incapacity', 'women', 'characters', 'firearms', 'writers', 'are', 'apparently', 'unaware', 'Gallup', 'reports', '43', '%', 'women', 'say', 'gun', 'home', '23', '%', 'women', 'personally', 'own', 'one', 'figures', 'would', 'be', 'higher', 'South', 'where', 'series', 'place', 'fact', 'series', 'treatment', 'firearms', 'general', 'just', 'peculiar', 'self-conscious', 'occasionally', 'factually', 'wrong', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'firearms', 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'one', 'read', 'book', 'who', 'live', 'parts', 'country', 'where', 'gun', 'ownership', 'common', 'are', 'unremarkable', 'part', 'life', 'not', 'subject', 'ton', 'awkward', 'discussion', 'odd', 'fascination.But', 'second', 'surprise', 'silly', 'writing', 'main', 'character', 'walks', 'past', 'acres', 'stalled', 'cars', 'jerrycan', 'gas', 'station', 'fill', 'instead', 'siphoning', 'gas', 'cars', 'passed', 'Siphoning', 'finally', 'show', 'up', 'later', 'episode', 'Characters', 'are', 'blissfully', 'overjoyed', 'having', 'hot', 'water', 'apparently', 'never', 'having', 'figured', 'out', 'can', 'heat', 'water', 'fire', 'much', 'world', 'currently', 'men', 'effortlessly', 'make', 'head', 'shot', 'head', 'shot', 'zombies', 'whereas', 'real', 'world', 'headshots', 'moving', 'target', 'are', 'pretty', 'hard', 'make', 'One', 'character', 'gun', 'sound', 'racking', 'slide', 'been', 'dubbed', 'nothing', 'do', 'what', 'going', 'visually', 'Major', 'explosions', 'happen', 'nearby', 'nobody', 'hearing', 'loss', 'Loud', 'noises', 'attract', 'zombies', 'only', 'one', 'character', 'bow', 'rest', 'use', 'firearms', 'suppressors', 'Etc', 'etc', 'Now', 'given', 'have', 'agreed', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'long', 'enough', 'believe', 'zombies', 'might', 'seem', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'first', 'rule', 'good', 'fantasy/science', 'fiction', 'have', 'take', 'world', 'seriously', 'reader', 'wo', ""n't"", 'either', 'one', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get']",N/A

1389562,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B0049P1VHS,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[1, 1]","Rick Grimes, a sheriff in a small Georgia town, is shot during an altercation and ends up in a coma. Waking up weeks later, he finds the hospital abandoned and corpses everywhere. He quickly discovers that the country is overrun by the walking dead. Rick sets out to find his missing wife and son, hoping they made it to the promised 'safe zone' in Atlanta, but finds that the city has fallen. But there are other survivors out there...Based on Robert Kirkman's comics, The Walking Dead is essentially a zombie movie that 'never ends' (or at least will go on much longer than any zombie movie or even series of zombie movies). Frank Darabont, the much-feted director of The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, has applied his writing and directing skills to Kirkman's comic to create something quite impressive.The Walking Dead's opening episode is bleak and cinematic, with Rick's predicament ably transmitted through Darabont's claustrophobic direction and Andrew Lincoln's superb performance as Rick. Lincoln, a Brit best-known for his comedic role in Teachers, plays Rick's frustration, fear and concern for his missing family to perfection. The first episode, with Rick alone against the zombie hordes, is arguably the best, but the remainder of the short first season, which sees Rick link up with a band of survivors outside Atlanta, is only a notch down in quality.The rest of the first season concerns itself with the survivors arguing over what to do next and explores the dynamics of the group. Rick's old cop partner Shane has been leading the group, but finds himself supplanted by Rick, which leads to some tension. Two of the other members of the group are racist thugs, setting up tension with the black and Hispanic members of the group, whilst another survivor takes out his frustrations and anger with the situation on his wife. It's not a happy group, and the writers and directors do a good job of exploring the characters and their interactions whilst remembering to bring the zombies on every once in a while to cause mayhem.Production values are extremely high. The zombie effects are great (a couple of them are obviously fake heads over ordinary people's faces, but these are very rare), up there with the best movies, whilst Atlanta (population 5 million, including the surrounding area) looks convincingly abandoned and bleak. There's a couple of ropey CGI explosions, but beyond that, The Walking Dead looks and feels like a big-budget movie.The story unfolds at a pretty good pace, though there's a couple of divergences in the second half of the season and a few moments of possible wheel-spinning. However, given that one of the appeals of the story (in both comic and TV form) is that it has the time to show such side-plots and explore the fall of America to a zombie horde in greater detail than a film or novel, that's not an invalid thing to do. By the end of the season there's also a renewed sense of purpose, as the survivors realise that the CDC (Centre for Disease Control) HQ is in Atlanta and may have some of the answers they are looking for. This marks the biggest change from the comics, where the CDC is not mentioned, but as Robert Kirkman (who wrote the fourth episode of the series) points out that's only because he didn't know it was there. If he had, the comics would also have gone there.

THE WALKING DEAD takes the zombie theme and brings it to a brand new level with intense drama and characters with depth and feeling the viewer can relate to.  The show sucks you in from the first second of the pilot.  And rest assured, there is blood and guts and gore galore but even with how great those scenes are it is the rest of the show that rules.  The story is more about the survivors.  It is thru their stories and interpersonal relationships that the heart and also true suspense and drama of the show lives.The blu ray is amazing.  The video presentation is superb.  The picture is intentionally a little grainy which adds to its effect while the clarity and sharpness of the picture brings everything to life.  Colors are bright and realistic.  Close-ups are very crisp and flesh tones very realistic.  The scenes with the dead are mezmerizing as the colors of their lifeless walking bodies mesh with the realistic blood and gore in the action sequences.  And the audio is also superb.  Dialogue is strong and the menacing scenes come to life utilizing all surround speakers.  It's a whole other dimension from watching it on tv or dvd.  Bottom line, this is a scary zombie series that comes to life due to the heart and soul of the human characters.  It is about survival, love, acceptance and trust.  Writing and directing are of course superb.

On one exceptionally slow day, I could find no ""make work,"" so I randomly selected a dvd to take a look at. The zombies must've been with me that day, for it wasn't more than a few minutes until I was hooked. I had no clue at the time who had produced it or on which cable outlet it appeared. I just knew it wasn't done on a shoe-string budget, nor was it appropriate for television (I wonder what time this program aired on AMC?). Incredibly, I actually found myself getting ticked-off when (much-needed) customers dared to enter my domain!I finished watching the last episode the next day and, as soon as I got home that night, I went online to order the COMPLETE series. When I found out this was the ONLY one out of the dozen or so I ordered that just had one season under its belt, I almost blew a gasket.At the risk of ruffling the feathers of the few who gave ""Walking Dead"" low marks, I'll say this: If you like zombie  movies, there is a 100% chance you will love this series. If you can't stand zombie movies, there is a far better than average chance that you will love this series! The acting is a-one. The subplots are intriguing.

Heck, we have or had TV shows on everything from vampires(True Blood, The Vampire Diaries, Moonlight) to werewolves(Teen Wolf) to aliens invading earth(V, Fallen Skies).The Walking Dead being the biggest hit of the 2010 television season might not be too far off, to be honest.Based on the acclaimed graphic novel by Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead follows police officer Rick Grimes who wakes up from a coma after being shot to find that the world he once knew no longer exists. In its' place, a zombie epidemic of worldly proportions. His wife and son are missing so he hits the road to look for them. Heading to Atlanta where, literally, all the survivors are heading; Rick finds a small group of people who struggle to survive as zombies face them at each and every turn.  That, my friends, is where the saga of The Walking Dead begins.If you're thinking that this show is like all the zombie movies you've ever watched, well- it isn't. What makes this show shine is how it deals with the humanity of this global epidemic. An example of this is how Rick, in one scene, goes back to put the Bicycle zombie woman out of her misery and apologizes to her that what happend to her happend & that he has to do what he has to do to end her suffering. Some reviewers out there seem to think that the show blows it out of proportion and make a big deal out of the emotional things. Personally, I think that is what sets this apart from all the other zombie stories out there. It gives a more realistic approach to dealing with a situation like that. I mean, ask yourself this..Would you not feel remorse for having to put someone out of their misery of being turned into something such as that?Make no mistake; there's plenty of blood, guts & everything else that makes zombie films so great..as well. It is a zombie program after all. So, for those of you that are in it for that, the show has that too.I suggest this show to all fans of the genre and even those who aren't.

1389580,A3LQU8CWUYFMJH,B0049P1VHS,Blu Review Obscura,"[0, 0]","The Walking Dead Season 1 Blu-ray ReviewDistributor: Anchor Bay Entertainment (US)Some of us have been waiting patiently for a full blown zombie television series for what seems like an eternity and finally after many years of rumours and speculation we finally get Frank Darabont's The Walking Dead.So, would the wait eventually prove to be worthwhile? Actually, it probably was.The series begins with the story of a police officer shot during his regular day to day activities, only to awake in hospital some weeks later to find that in the meantime the world he knew has simply gone to Hell, quite literally. The story progresses across 6 episodes and deals with a handful of survivors battling hordes of the undead whilst trying to find a safe haven and avoid becoming the next zombie meal. With a fair amount of character background which builds across the various relationships, the struggle for survival brings a decent amount of tension to the screen with characters that you will actually care for and a couple of reasonably well placed twists along the way to keep you guessing. The gore factor is also pretty high for a television series and the effects look altogether excellent throughout.Worth noting in fact, is that the gore looked so realistic, that in all countries other than the original US broadcasts, edits have been applied to a couple of the episodes during their major gore scenes. This also remains true of the Blu-ray releases as every other version apart from this US disc contains the cut print, so if you want to see the full version of the episodes, you will be needing this US release from Anchor Bay. The only problem there being is that this disc is unfortunately locked to region A. More proof if any was required, that a region free Blu-ray player is the only way to go.Anchor Bay have released The Walking Dead with an excellent 1080p 1.78:1 wide-screen transfer which looks fantastic. Detail is superb with colours and black levels enriching the performance. Having watched the original broadcasts, the Blu-ray looks to be on a different level and really immerses you into the story. With no print damage on display and enough grain to enhance the atmosphere and still give that home made quality, this really is the ultimate way to view the series.Audio is also excellent. Presented with a True HD 5.1 soundtrack there is plenty here to grab your attention. From the moaning hordes of re-animated corpses to the bullet ridden showdowns, the audio drags you kicking and screaming into the action. Dialogue is clean and crisp, explosions are bassy and powerful and combined with the already classic music score, an altogether brilliant performance is delivered throughout.Extras are also of an excellent quality, including The Making of The Walking Dead which provides a 30 minute documentary delving into various behind-the-scenes features and interviews with the cast and crew. Following this there are six mini featurettes which each focus on one particular episode in turn, behind the scenes make up tests, a producers Q&A; session with a Comic-Con setting and a couple of zombie specific supplements. Rounding all of this off, there are also a couple of cast interviews and an on camera tour of one of the shows sets.All things considered, this set is a must have for zombie fans everywhere and although some parts of the series share more than a passing similarity to films like 28 days later and modern day zombie remakes such as the Dawn of the Dead, the story here is both fun filled and gripping with more than enough new concepts to please all but the most demanding horror fan. With Season 2 beginning later this year, there is no better time to revisit the first season again, especially in its new enhanced presentation.""WHAT MAKES US HUMAN?""BLU REVIEW OBSCURA - for those less mainstream Blu-ray reviews - find us in Facebook",5,Blu Review 38 The Walking Dead,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,3877,"['Walking', 'Dead', 'Season', '1', 'Blu-ray', 'ReviewDistributor', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'US', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'patiently', 'full', 'blown', 'zombie', 'television', 'series', 'what', 'eternity', 'finally', 'many', 'years', 'rumours', 'speculation', 'finally', 'get', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'Walking', 'Dead.So', 'would', 'wait', 'eventually', 'prove', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'Actually', 'probably', 'was.The', 'series', 'story', 'police', 'officer', 'shot', 'regular', 'day', 'day', 'activities', 'only', 'awake', 'hospital', 'weeks', 'later', 'find', 'meantime', 'world', 'knew', 'simply', 'gone', 'Hell', 'quite', 'literally', 'story', '6', 'episodes', 'deals', 'handful', 'survivors', 'battling', 'hordes', 'undead', 'whilst', 'trying', 'find', 'safe', 'haven', 'avoid', 'becoming', 'next', 'zombie', 'meal', 'fair', 'amount', 'character', 'background', 'various', 'relationships', 'struggle', 'survival', 'brings', 'decent', 'amount', 'tension', 'screen', 'characters', 'will', 'actually', 'care', 'couple', 'reasonably', 'well', 'placed', 'twists', 'way', 'keep', 'guessing', 'gore', 'factor', 'also', 'pretty', 'high', 'television', 'series', 'effects', 'look', 'altogether', 'excellent', 'throughout.Worth', 'noting', 'fact', 'gore', 'looked', 'so', 'realistic', 'countries', 'other', 'original', 'US', 'broadcasts', 'edits', 'have', 'been', 'applied', 'couple', 'episodes', 'major', 'gore', 'scenes', 'also', 'true', 'Blu-ray', 'releases', 'other', 'version', 'apart', 'US', 'disc', 'cut', 'print', 'so', 'want', 'see', 'full', 'version', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'needing', 'US', 'release', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'only', 'problem', 'being', 'disc', 'unfortunately', 'locked', 'region', 'A', 'More', 'proof', 'was', 'required', 'region', 'free', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'only', 'way', 'go.Anchor', 'Bay', 'have', 'released', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'excellent', '1080p', '1.78:1', 'wide-screen', 'transfer', 'fantastic', 'Detail', 'superb', 'colours', 'black', 'levels', 'enriching', 'performance', 'Having', 'watched', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'Blu-ray', 'be', 'different', 'level', 'really', 'immerses', 'story', 'print', 'damage', 'display', 'enough', 'grain', 'enhance', 'atmosphere', 'still', 'give', 'home', 'made', 'quality', 'really', 'ultimate', 'way', 'view', 'series.Audio', 'also', 'excellent', 'Presented', 'True', 'HD', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'plenty', 'here', 'grab', 'attention', 'moaning', 'hordes', 're-animated', 'corpses', 'bullet', 'ridden', 'showdowns', 'audio', 'drags', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'action', 'Dialogue', 'clean', 'crisp', 'explosions', 'are', 'bassy', 'powerful', 'combined', 'already', 'classic', 'music', 'score', 'altogether', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'delivered', 'throughout.Extras', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'quality', 'including', 'Making', 'Walking', 'Dead', '30', 'minute', 'documentary', 'delving', 'various', 'behind-the-scenes', 'features', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'Following', 'are', 'six', 'mini', 'featurettes', 'focus', 'one', 'particular', 'episode', 'turn', 'scenes', 'make', 'up', 'tests', 'producers', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'Comic-Con', 'setting', 'couple', 'zombie', 'specific', 'supplements', 'Rounding', 'off', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'cast', 'interviews', 'camera', 'tour', 'one', 'shows', 'sets.All', 'things', 'considered', 'set', 'must', 'have', 'zombie', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'parts', 'series', 'share', 'more', 'passing', 'similarity', 'films', '28', 'days', 'later', 'modern', 'day', 'zombie', 'remakes', 'such', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'story', 'here', 'fun', 'filled', 'gripping', 'more', 'enough', 'new', 'concepts', 'please', 'most', 'demanding', 'horror', 'fan', 'Season', '2', 'beginning', 'later', 'year', 'better', 'time', 'revisit', 'first', 'season', 'again', 'especially', 'new', 'enhanced', 'presentation', 'WHAT', 'MAKES', 'HUMAN', 'BLU', 'REVIEW', 'OBSCURA', 'less', 'mainstream', 'Blu-ray', 'find', 'Facebook']",N/A
1389581,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B0049P1VHS,B. Martin,"[0, 0]","AMC is already home to two of the most critically acclaimed and popular series on television (Mad Men, Breaking Bad) but the network's latest addtion may be its finest yet.  The Walking Dead is an invigorating update of the zombie/apocolypse genre adapted from the graphic novel series created by Robert Kirkman.  Don't worry though, you don't have to have read any of the comics in order to appreciate this gripping and emotionally charged drama.  Chances are that The Walking Dead will appeal to fans of zombie flicks as well as fans of great television.Produced by Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile) The Walking Dead's six episode freshman season follows a group of survivors in the wake of a world wide viral breakout that has turned its victims into an army of mindless, flesh craving corpses referred to as ""walkers"".  The series follows the small but closely knit group as they struggle to stay alive and find any sign of hope for the future of the human race.  The action is often gory and wince inducing, and Darabont and his creative team have constructed an excellent milieu of desolation and decay--particularly when the action shifts to the streets of Atlanta.  But what keeps you watching and coming back for more is the human element.  Each of the characters is painfully human with shortcomings and fears aplenty.  Viewers will likely find themselves at turns aggravated and inspired by the selfish and selfless actions of the cast.There may only be six installments of this first season, but that is more than enough time for The Walking Dead to develop into a fully realized drama with complex characters, gripping suspense and a undeniable sense of dread.  The season finale in which the survivors take refuge inside the CDC in Atlanta is a telling example of just how dire things are and how steeply the chips are stacked against them.  The will to survive may be the only thing that keeps them moving forward.  And what are they moving towards?  We'll have to wait for season two for answers to that question.

I was in.I was especially happy that AMC was taking this project on, because I love Mad Men, and I have appreciated Breaking Bad from afar (I did watch the first 4 episodes and plan on watching more). To top things off the writer Robert Kirkman, Frank Darabont, Mike Nicotero ,and Gale Anne Hurd were on board.Im a huge fan of all of them. A show like this HAS to have a good cast. The graphic novels are so well loved, and the characters so significant, that to not honor them would be a tragedy. For the most part the cast is a dream there is but one stinker in the bunch (im looking at you Sarah Wayne Callies).A show that follows a book/novel/comic cannot just stick to the original story line like glue, you have to veer off at some point and make new paths. The smart fans will understand that, the fans with half a brain eaten wont. I happen to love where they take this season, what they added and what they took away. It made perfect sense to me.The makeup ...oh the special effects! I couldnt have asked for better Walkers (they are never called zombies...i love that) from the ""hero"" dead, to the glimpsed and shot dead, its all a giant bloody rotten orgasm to my eyes.

Even though this show has some differences from the books, I still enjoy the program very much.  That is the reason why I jumped on season one at the $27 price here on Amazon for the Blu-ray version.My reason for the four star rating has little to do with the content of the show, but rather is a complaint about the quality of the Blu-ray.  I watch this show through my PS3 in 1080p on an LG LCD TV, and I am disappointed in many scenes.  The video quality looks like the show was shot in improperly lit scenes with a Canon dSLR set on a high ISO.  There is way too much grain in the shots done in the forest or inside of rooms.  It is distracting and annoying to see this on a Blu-ray edition.  What makes it so frustrating is that in many shots, ones that are well lit, this issue does not exist.Maybe I have unrealistic expectations in hoping for Hollywood film quality Blu-ray resolution from a TV show.  Even so, I think this is something that takes away from the quality of the presentation.  The difference between the price on the DVD and Blu-ray editions is about $5, so I would suggest someone who owns both go ahead and get the Blu-ray.  That said, I would like to see the difference between the DVD in an up-converting player (like my PS3) and the Blu-ray.In spite of that minor complaint, I still love the show and can't wait for season two.",4,A Difficult Review,1304640000,"05 6, 2011",2011,1472,"['love', 'show', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'day', 'one', 'when', 'purchased', 'original', 'books', 'years', 'ago', 'Even', 'show', 'differences', 'books', 'still', 'enjoy', 'program', 'very', 'much', 'reason', 'why', 'jumped', 'season', 'one', '27', 'price', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Blu-ray', 'version.My', 'reason', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'little', 'do', 'content', 'show', 'rather', 'complaint', 'quality', 'Blu-ray', 'watch', 'show', 'PS3', '1080p', 'LG', 'LCD', 'TV', 'am', 'disappointed', 'many', 'scenes', 'video', 'quality', 'show', 'was', 'shot', 'improperly', 'lit', 'scenes', 'Canon', 'dSLR', 'set', 'high', 'ISO', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'grain', 'shots', 'done', 'forest', 'inside', 'rooms', 'distracting', 'annoying', 'see', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'What', 'frustrating', 'many', 'shots', 'ones', 'are', 'well', 'lit', 'issue', 'not', 'exist.Maybe', 'have', 'unrealistic', 'expectations', 'hoping', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'quality', 'Blu-ray', 'resolution', 'TV', 'show', 'Even', 'so', 'think', 'something', 'away', 'quality', 'presentation', 'difference', 'price', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'editions', '5', 'would', 'suggest', 'someone', 'who', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', 'Blu-ray', 'said', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'difference', 'DVD', 'up-converting', 'player', 'PS3', 'Blu-ray.In', 'spite', 'minor', 'complaint', 'still', 'love', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', 'two']",N/A

If you like being scared and the idea of a zombie apocalypse appeals to you then be sure to check this out. It really takes a couple of episodes to get to know all the characters but the show comes together pretty quickly after the second ep I think. The show also seems to parallel the comic book but not exactly- there are subtle differences. Lots of action too. And you never know who's gonna die and who's gonna live. They really keep you guessing since no one is really safe. Lots of bonus stuff on the dvd's- almost too much. I don't like seeing too much behind the scenes stuff b/c it takes away from the realness of the show. The scenery is gorgeous too since they really film in some of those small Southern towns in Georgia in and around Atlanta. The characters are so real- not at all laughable.

I finally got to see the series on DVD. While it was so very gripping that I ended up watching all 6 episodes in a marathon, some of the melodramatic turns left me annoyed.Keep in mind, I'm not one of those guys that say, ""Oh, they changed it, now it sucks."" I knew they had changed things before I started watching the series. Why would I watch it if it was just going to be a direct translation from the comic books? If I wanted to see it all again, I'd just reread my comic books. Some of the changes they made are reasonable. There are other survivors. That's okay. What makes the main characters so special?It's just the racists, wife beaters, and dead wives that are a detriment to my enjoyment. It's acted well, but I see it all coming from a mile away. Plus, some of the main characters from the comic books are missing or different in varying degrees. Allen, Donna, and the Twins are missing, but they still might pick them up next season. Jim talks a good amount, where originally he was in a PTSD-style shock. And Carol (a favorite of mine) is very different.I bought the Two-Disk DVD set and I'm happy with it. There isn't anything extra on the Blu-Ray version. Four episodes are on the first disk, then two more on the second disk, plus about 2-hours of extra features. If you think it's too much to pay $20 for 6 episodes, then think of it as a six-hour movie instead.I'm overall impressed with the series. I'm still looking forward to the second season.

1389661,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0049P1VHS,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[4, 9]","I've been reading the ""Walking Dead"" series for several years and was pleased to hear that it had been adapted for TV.  Like the comic, the show focusses on the emotional impact of the zombie plague on the human survivors... There is some violence, and some gory gross-out stuff, but for the most part the zombie ""walkers"" are in the background, an ever-present, overwhelming danger but not the main focus of the drama.  There is already some plot divergence from the books, and I'm still waiting for some of my favorite characters to show up... But for the most part, this is a satisfying, suspenseful zombie epic, and is a nice compliment to the original graphic novels.  I'm looking forward to seeing where they take it from here... So far, so good!  (Joe Sixpack)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------POSTSCRIPT: After Season Two came out (which totally rocks!) I went back and watched this season again, this time on the DVD release. I really was surprised to find that the DVD edition _edited out_ the gruesome, graphic sequence in the episode ""Guts"" in which the Rick and Glenn chop up a zombie corpse and coat themselves in its gore and viscera in order to ""pass"" as zombies themselves in order to escape a zombie herd. It's one of the most genuinely horrifying scenes in a zombie show that goes to great pains to elevate itself from being a mere splatterfest, but it's also one of the greatest dramatic successes of Season One -- it's a horrible scene which really makes the stakes of survival feel visceral and real. Editing it out was lame. The third disc of bonus features also deserves some comment: the ""black and white"" version of Episode One seems pointless, and doesn't really look that good. (Whatever.) But the ""making of"" featurettes are fun... Overall, I found the DVD release to be more enjoyable than the streaming video I bought when the show was new - no buffering issues or visual jumps. But the decision to edit gross stuff out seems pretty bizarre, if you ask me.",4,So far so good...,1291680000,"12 7, 2010",2010,2047,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'series', 'several', 'years', 'was', 'pleased', 'hear', 'had', 'been', 'adapted', 'TV', 'comic', 'show', 'emotional', 'impact', 'zombie', 'plague', 'human', 'survivors', 'violence', 'gory', 'gross-out', 'stuff', 'most', 'part', 'zombie', 'walkers', 'are', 'background', 'ever-present', 'overwhelming', 'danger', 'not', 'main', 'focus', 'drama', 'already', 'plot', 'divergence', 'books', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'favorite', 'characters', 'show', 'up', 'most', 'part', 'satisfying', 'suspenseful', 'zombie', 'epic', 'nice', 'compliment', 'original', 'graphic', 'novels', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'where', 'take', 'here', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'Joe', 'Sixpack', 'POSTSCRIPT', 'Season', 'Two', 'came', 'totally', 'went', 'back', 'watched', 'season', 'again', 'time', 'DVD', 'release', 'really', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'DVD', 'edition', '_edited', 'gruesome', 'graphic', 'sequence', 'episode', 'Guts', 'Rick', 'Glenn', 'chop', 'up', 'zombie', 'corpse', 'coat', 'gore', 'viscera', 'order', 'pass', 'zombies', 'order', 'escape', 'zombie', 'herd', 'one', 'most', 'genuinely', 'horrifying', 'scenes', 'zombie', 'show', 'great', 'pains', 'elevate', 'being', 'mere', 'splatterfest', 'also', 'one', 'greatest', 'dramatic', 'successes', 'Season', 'One', 'horrible', 'scene', 'really', 'stakes', 'survival', 'feel', 'visceral', 'real', 'Editing', 'out', 'was', 'lame', 'third', 'disc', 'bonus', 'features', 'also', 'comment', 'black', 'white', 'version', 'Episode', 'One', 'pointless', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'good', 'Whatever', 'making', 'featurettes', 'are', 'fun', 'Overall', 'found', 'DVD', 'release', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'streaming', 'video', 'bought', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'new', 'buffering', 'issues', 'visual', 'jumps', 'decision', 'edit', 'gross', 'stuff', 'pretty', 'bizarre', 'ask']",N/A

I can tell UPS is throwing heavy stuff on top of smaller, fragile orders.  And I buy rare and hard to find music and movies which means there are no more copies than the one I bought, so if it comes in broken, it's gone for good.I will not support online shopping anymore if UPS's lack of concern for people's purchases go on like this.  I'm sure a lot of people will act like &#34;oh I'll just get a refund and buy it from somewhere else.&#34;  But I'm sure they're not happy having to buy the one product they wanted twice, and having to wait even longer than they originally had to because UPS won't handle fragile products carefully.

But Rick's nightmare truly begins when he wakes up to find the dead have come back to life to feast upon the living. He sets out to find his wife and son, whom he believes have abandoned their homes for safer shelter and could still be alive. He ventures to Atlanta to find it overrun by ""walkers,"" and only manages to make it out alive with the aid of a handful of survivors who have set up camp in the hills outside of town. Rick joins the group as they struggle to survive zombie attacks, internal conflicts within the group, and a journey to the CDC in search of a cure, answers, or just hope in a future where the likelihood of living much longer is incredibly slim.Darabont sets a measured, cinematic pace, so nothing in the show feels rushed for the sake of fitting the hourlong timeslot. The show certainly doesn't skimp on production value either, as we get to see all the guts and gore (and even the occasional profanity) that is inherent in the zombie genre. Thankfully, cable channel AMC, producers of shows like Mad Men and Breaking Bad, allows its shows to push the envelope with its content, because if The Walking Dead had been produced by one of the more conservative broadcast channels, then the show probably would not have turned out as fantastic as it did. We also get to see broad cityscapes ravaged by the fall of society, and it's pretty remarkable that any major city would let a production of any kind take over its streets the way The Walking Dead does with Atlanta.But the element that makes the show truly shine is the human element. It isn't a show merely about zombies, its about the struggles of those left standing after the world ends. The title ""The Walking Dead"" describes the zombies who have overrun the planet, but it also describes Rick and the other survivors and the almost hopeless nature of their situation. They might survive the hoards of undead now, but for how long? Is there any point of holding out hope when it seems almost futile to try in a world where falling prey to the flesh-eating masses seems inevitable?The Walking Dead may be a television series, but it has the look and feel of a big-budget zombie film, and it was easily the best new series of 2010.This two-disc Blu-Ray set includes all of Season 1's episodes as well as behind-the-scenes and ""Making Of"" docs as well as a fun little tutorial about doing your own zombie make-up by Greg Nicotero of the Oscar-winning special effects group KNB EFX.",5,Zombies on television?

Johnson ""'ntohign slhe thaersam'""","[1, 1]","Most folk reading this probably read the graphic novels and watched the first season as it was aired on A&E; and then bought the DVD/BD when it became available. I know that was how I experienced the show. When this re-release was announced, I actually found myself looking forward to the Special Edition.The reasoning is simple - every episode had at least one commentary track (Pilot Ep has two in fact). A whole slew of featurettes, and the original pilot... shot in unrelenting black & white. I've gone through most of the special features and have greatly enjoyed the commentary, specifically director Frank Darabont's musings through the Pilot. He describes the series as an event that allowed him to do the sort of film he'd always wanted to.Yes, from the man who did Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile. But we know his involvement simply meant that folk would take this project seriously, and as it should be. You can't sell a survival horror story without the deep humanizing that we see in this much too short of it's first season.One note: commentary tracks may 'dare' you to point out an f/x shot that was done practically or digitally; apparently they think these effects are done so well, you can't tell. Well, for that I have only one thing to say...CGI is very clear on a big 47"" screen and PS3 BD.Now, it is amazing that they now reveal their is a lot more CGI in these introductory shots. The military base outside the hospital... whole thing: CGI, except for a heli shell, but even it's blades were CGI.I've written this review specifically to give you as possible buyers what you are getting into. If you are a fan of just the show and don't go for new bonus features and whatnot, don't feel bad and hang on to your original purchase when it was first released. Keep it. It's a great set that I own as well.But I geek out over the tech stuff. So this Special Edition is a beautiful addition to my BD collection. Bottom line it: do you go geek over zombies? If you do, even in the slightest, pick this up.And I can almost swear that picture is much, much improved upon. Now you should go back and switch it to 7.1 sound.

1389687,A2GPRA9HHLOC4B,B0049P1VHS,Eric L. Willard,"[3, 5]","I will give Season 1 3.5-4 stars for the following reasons.Good:When seeing it was an AMC series, I knew they didn't skimp on their shows but I was hesitant in how well they could do a zomie film with all the special effects and such. The effects here were really well done. My hat comes off to the effects crew on this. It was top notch. There was a behind the scenes showing one actor getting his makeup applied and although they could have shown a much better example, it was a good clip.Cameos: There are many cameos in this series that go uncreditted. 5 episodes have Norman Reedus (Boondock Saints) who sticks around for some time and has a major part but as stated, is uncreditted at the beginning. This was a surprise that I am willing to put in the GOOD side. Also, Michael Rooker (Mallrats, The Replacement Killers) had a cameo for 2 episodes that was uncreditted in the opening. Again, good to see some big names providing good input.Acting: Was well done. It didn't seem like a made for TV movie. They really stepped up and made a good show.PLOT: Is good and bad for the following reason. I have seen movies like Pulp Fiction (for instance) that didn't go in exact chronological order and they were still great. This series jumps a round a little bit and felt like they didn't have to do that and it made it a little less enjoyable. We open with our main character in a cop car with his partner talking about their relationships. In a police chase, the main character gets shot. Cut to, our hero in the hospital, zombies are already taking over, eventually our hero makes his way home to find nothing/no one. When he comes across his partner later, the partner initially acts like he doesn't know him? Also, I believe the partner was now with the hero's wife? This issue was discussed in the show but we never really got a conclusion.SPOILERSecond example, a guy named Jim gets bit but it's not quite the end of the season, he is left by the road and the survivors move on without him. So, we know he got bit, we do not know if he turns. Season 2 can still have him return but he wasn't a strong character to begin with.What did the scientist wisper to Officer Grimes? I think it was that he is a ""carrier"" of the disease. Remember he took blood samples of everyone? Also, his partner said that Grimes had no pulse. He thought he was dead.BAD:I have to say, it seemed short for the money you pay. I watched the entire season in one evening. I couldn't do that with True Blood.I say, even with a few odd plot holes, and some non-chronological annoyances that go unanswered in this season, it is still a good series and worth the watch. 3.5-4 stars is respectable. Lets give credit here to the actors, effects and overall story.I am rating the regular DVD. It has a behind the scenes for the making of, one for each episode and one for the zombie makup.

DVD has plenty.",4,3-4 stars for a few good reasons,1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,2932,"['will', 'give', 'Season', '1', '3.5-4', 'stars', 'following', 'reasons.Good', 'When', 'seeing', 'was', 'AMC', 'series', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'skimp', 'shows', 'was', 'hesitant', 'how', 'well', 'could', 'do', 'zomie', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'such', 'effects', 'here', 'were', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'hat', 'effects', 'crew', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'was', 'scenes', 'showing', 'one', 'actor', 'getting', 'makeup', 'applied', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'much', 'better', 'example', 'was', 'good', 'clip.Cameos', 'are', 'many', 'cameos', 'series', 'go', 'uncreditted', '5', 'episodes', 'have', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'who', 'sticks', 'around', 'time', 'major', 'part', 'stated', 'uncreditted', 'beginning', 'was', 'surprise', 'am', 'willing', 'put', 'GOOD', 'side', 'Also', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'Mallrats', 'Replacement', 'Killers', 'had', 'cameo', '2', 'episodes', 'was', 'uncreditted', 'opening', 'Again', 'good', 'see', 'big', 'names', 'providing', 'good', 'input.Acting', 'Was', 'well', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'really', 'stepped', 'up', 'made', 'good', 'show.PLOT', 'good', 'bad', 'following', 'reason', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'instance', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'exact', 'chronological', 'order', 'were', 'still', 'great', 'series', 'round', 'little', 'bit', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'made', 'little', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'open', 'main', 'character', 'cop', 'car', 'partner', 'talking', 'relationships', 'police', 'chase', 'main', 'character', 'shot', 'Cut', 'hero', 'hospital', 'zombies', 'are', 'already', 'taking', 'over', 'eventually', 'hero', 'way', 'home', 'find', 'nothing/no', 'one', 'When', 'partner', 'later', 'partner', 'initially', ""n't"", 'know', 'Also', 'believe', 'partner', 'was', 'now', 'hero', 'wife', 'issue', 'was', 'discussed', 'show', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'conclusion.SPOILERSecond', 'example', 'guy', 'named', 'Jim', 'bit', 'not', 'quite', 'end', 'season', 'left', 'road', 'survivors', 'move', 'So', 'know', 'got', 'bit', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Season', '2', 'can', 'still', 'have', 'return', 'was', ""n't"", 'strong', 'character', 'begin', 'did', 'scientist', 'wisper', 'Officer', 'Grimes', 'think', 'was', 'carrier', 'disease', 'Remember', 'took', 'blood', 'samples', 'everyone', 'Also', 'partner', 'said', 'Grimes', 'had', 'pulse', 'thought', 'was', 'dead.BAD', 'have', 'say', 'seemed', 'short', 'money', 'pay', 'watched', 'entire', 'season', 'one', 'evening', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'True', 'Blood.I', 'say', 'even', 'few', 'odd', 'plot', 'holes', 'non-chronological', 'annoyances', 'go', 'unanswered', 'season', 'still', 'good', 'series', 'watch', '3.5-4', 'stars', 'respectable', 'Lets', 'give', 'credit', 'here', 'actors', 'effects', 'overall', 'story.I', 'am', 'rating', 'regular', 'DVD', 'scenes', 'making', 'one', 'episode', 'one', 'zombie', 'makup', 'Bluray', 'might', 'have', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'reg', 'DVD', 'plenty']",N/A

I am a big fan of zombies in any format mainly because my brother is literally scared of them. I can't help it but I love it. So when I first that the comic was being turned into a series I was super excited. I had always believed that this would be the right format for such a grand story. If this was made into a feature film there is no way it could fit all that it would need to.Now as a big fan of the comic from Robert Kirkman I could tell you anything that is spot on direct and anything changed but that would take the fun out of it. Plus for any one who has not read it or is not a comic reader this is a very stand alone show. Any one who has read the comic I will say that you should not be disappointed, sure the comic is classic but this show is also really good. Well cast, acted, written, and directed, I would have to say that this was and is a great show.The great first season was six episodes long with each paced very well and surprisingly kept in tact what the comic was about. That of course is the humans and not the zombies; it really is a character driven story. I knew with Frank Darabont on board this would be made right. He did a great job here has I really enjoyed this show, from TV all the way to DVD/Blu-Ray.The story follows a cop named Rick Grimes who is shot in the line of duty; he ends up in a coma. When he finally awakes no one is to be found and he is all alone, alone in the hospital. He now is on the hunt for his wife and son who as far as he knows are missing. Everything he knew and loved is gone, and besides meeting two new friends they go their own ways. He heads to Atlanta based on a tip to find his family and runs into undead and other survivors along the way. Now outside of the city it turns out wife Lori and his son Carl are with another group of survivors including Rick's best friend and co worker Shane Walsh. They all believe Rick to be dead so that leads to an interesting dynamic for our little group of friends.Like I said before this is a character driven story and it really helps the show out. Now of course the ""walkers"" are there ready to eat all humans, and there are a lot of them. When there is action there is some good action but the story is really strongest amongst the living. So one group is already out there surviving and one man is out there in the middle of it all looking for his family. Do they find each other, well I say watch the show or read the comic to find out.I will just say that the entire cast was great in my opinion and were wonderfully cast. So there is no need to go one by one since they were all great. Of the six episodes Frank Darabont was a writer on four and directed the first episode. I would also like to point out that Ernest Dickerson directed an episode, you may know him as a Spike Lee prot&eacute;g&eacute; who directed classics like ""Juice"" and ""Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight"". Any way the writers and directors for this sure all did a good job here.Now special features for the two disc set include a making of, inside each episode, sneak peaks, behind the scenes, a convention panel, and the trailer.

And I must say the show was well worth the wait: THE WALKING DEAD is the best new show on TV in years and I commend AMC and Frank Darabont for having the guts to put it on the air; I mean, a TV series built around the zombie apocalypse, there's no way in hell ABC, CBS, NBC, or FOX would ever put something like this on the air, maybe that is why they are bleeding viewers?I loved the way this series jumped right into the action: Deputy Sheriff Rick Grimes, in a coma after being wounded in the line of duty, wakes up in a seemingly deserted hospital, surrounded by rotting corpses, lined up row upon row. He quickly learns from another survivor that while he was out, a plague has ravaged humanity, wiping out civilization and ushering in a new Dark Age more horrific than any worst case scenario: the dead have risen to devour the living and their numbers seem endless.But this in not a story centered on the zombies, it is very much about the human characters and the price they must pay to survive: how they must try and hold onto their humanity when death is coming for them day and night.  After a while, you wonder if the title isn't referring to the zombies, but to the living, now making their way in a world where survival simply may not be worth it.This sounds pretty damn bleak, but it's terrific storytelling.  I am a sucker for a great end of the world tale, and I took notice that in every episode the natural world is presented as lush and green, full of bright sunshine, a perfect contrast to the horror in its midst.There are some great scenes, especially Rick's arrival in Atlanta and his confrontation with an army of zombies in episode one; same thing for the nocturnal zombie attack at the end of episode four.  There are also plenty of quiet moments where characters are allowed to develop, some may think this slows the show down, but they add the depth needed to make the violent moments hit with a harder punch.Yes there is gore, but it's not over the top, nobody is trying to outdo George A. Romero.  We are shown what is necessary to drive home the horror of the situation.  And the acting is terrific, especially newcomers Andrew Lincoln as Rick and Jon Bernthal as his partner and best friend, Shane, who shares a guilty secret with Rick's wife.  Jeffry DeMunn and Steven Yuen are standouts in the supporting cast, while Michael Rooker and Norman Reedus shine as a pair of redneck brothers.And all praise to Robert Kirkman, whose comic book, THE WALKING DEAD,is what the series is based on.  My biggest complaint, the season is way too short at only six episodes.

1389700,A39C2BQXZHOUMJ,B0049P1VHS,G. Dowling,"[3, 4]","""The Walking Dead"" is the most exciting show of the new season.  While its based on a graphic novel of the same title and it adheres to that storyline with shocking fidelity, it certainly borrows freely from various genre entries.  What is surprising about all this, is how fresh it feels.  This is mainly due to the show very wisely focusing on character development, story and its philosophical contemplations on morality Vs. survival and how each character clings to hope or gives up in the face of a world gone insane.  This is truly one of the great doomsday stories and its brought to television with unflinching realism by screenwriter/director Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, The Mist).  Darabont wisely avoided casting any major stars, but instead has gathered a superb ensemble of character actors which only adds to the show's sense of reality and gives us a depth of character we might not have otherwise had if the show revolved around the vanity of a major star.  It'a exciting, terrifying, moving, and often very funny, with terrific production values and surprisingly graphic, stomach turning gore and violence.  This first season has only six episodes, but the show packs more drama and excitement into those 6 episodes than most shows do in a 20 episode season.The blu-ray presentation is a 1080p, widescreen picture that looks fabulous and is true to source.  Even if you watched the show in HD, this is a considerable upgrade, as it only enhances the cinematic look and feel.  Shot on 16mm film, instead of video, the show has a grimy, depressed look, with lots of swirling film grain that only adds to the reality of the story making it more immediate and intimate.  This is what Blu-ray is all about.  Fans will be overjoyed by this.  Special effects and mnake-up look fantastic, with every welt and bit of gore visible down to the smallest spots of blood.The audio is a truly awesome Dolby TrueHD 5.1 mox which lets us know right at the outset that it means business.  Gunshots, explosions, and action are rendered with unnerving realism and power, aided by strong LFE support.  Ambient surrounds are very scary as we can hear zombies moaning and growling all around the listening area.  Dialogue and subtle ambient sound (crickets chirping, birds, sounds of silence) are rendered with pinpoint accuracy.  Dialogue is crisp and beautifully reproduced.  The haunting theme music and score pours fromn the speakers.  Imaging is terrific.  Audiophiles and fans of the show will be giddy listening to ""The Walking Dead"" on BD.The supplement package is pretty good with a thorough making-of doc, interviews with cast and creators, a doc on ""Zombie School"" shows us how the extras were trained to move like the undead.  I would have enjoyed audio commentaries on select episodes, or even better, all of the episodes given there are only 6 in this first season.  I would have loved to hear the cast offer ruminations on the episode entitled ""Guts"" which required some of the cast members to wear entrails from one of the ""Walkers"" in order to fool them into thinking they were one of them.  But alas, the extras are fairly satisfying, but could have been better.Overall, this set earns my highest recommendation.  The show is the real focus here and it is produced beautifully with a kickass lossless soundtrack.  This is a must-have for genre fans, and even non-fans will quickly become addicted to this gripping and exciting show.",5,A Blu-ray review,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,3474,"['Walking', 'Dead', 'most', 'exciting', 'show', 'new', 'season', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'storyline', 'shocking', 'fidelity', 'certainly', 'freely', 'various', 'genre', 'entries', 'What', 'surprising', 'how', 'fresh', 'mainly', 'due', 'show', 'very', 'wisely', 'focusing', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'philosophical', 'contemplations', 'morality', 'Vs.', 'survival', 'how', 'character', 'clings', 'hope', 'up', 'face', 'world', 'gone', 'insane', 'truly', 'one', 'great', 'doomsday', 'stories', 'brought', 'television', 'unflinching', 'realism', 'screenwriter/director', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Green', 'Mile', 'Mist', 'Darabont', 'wisely', 'avoided', 'casting', 'major', 'stars', 'instead', 'gathered', 'superb', 'ensemble', 'character', 'actors', 'only', 'show', 'sense', 'reality', 'depth', 'character', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'otherwise', 'had', 'show', 'revolved', 'vanity', 'major', 'star', 'exciting', 'terrifying', 'moving', 'often', 'very', 'funny', 'terrific', 'production', 'values', 'surprisingly', 'graphic', 'stomach', 'turning', 'gore', 'violence', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'show', 'more', 'drama', 'excitement', '6', 'episodes', 'most', 'shows', 'do', '20', 'episode', 'season.The', 'blu-ray', 'presentation', '1080p', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'fabulous', 'true', 'source', 'Even', 'watched', 'show', 'HD', 'considerable', 'upgrade', 'only', 'cinematic', 'look', 'feel', 'Shot', '16mm', 'film', 'instead', 'video', 'show', 'grimy', 'depressed', 'look', 'lots', 'swirling', 'film', 'grain', 'only', 'reality', 'story', 'making', 'more', 'immediate', 'intimate', 'what', 'Blu-ray', 'Fans', 'will', 'be', 'overjoyed', 'Special', 'effects', 'mnake-up', 'look', 'fantastic', 'welt', 'bit', 'gore', 'visible', 'down', 'smallest', 'spots', 'blood.The', 'audio', 'truly', 'awesome', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '5.1', 'mox', 'know', 'right', 'outset', 'business', 'Gunshots', 'explosions', 'action', 'are', 'rendered', 'unnerving', 'realism', 'power', 'aided', 'strong', 'LFE', 'support', 'Ambient', 'surrounds', 'are', 'very', 'scary', 'can', 'hear', 'zombies', 'moaning', 'growling', 'listening', 'area', 'Dialogue', 'subtle', 'ambient', 'sound', 'crickets', 'chirping', 'birds', 'sounds', 'silence', 'are', 'rendered', 'pinpoint', 'accuracy', 'Dialogue', 'crisp', 'beautifully', 'reproduced', 'haunting', 'theme', 'music', 'score', 'pours', 'fromn', 'speakers', 'Imaging', 'terrific', 'Audiophiles', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'giddy', 'listening', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'BD.The', 'supplement', 'package', 'pretty', 'good', 'thorough', 'making-of', 'doc', 'interviews', 'cast', 'creators', 'doc', 'Zombie', 'School', 'how', 'extras', 'were', 'trained', 'move', 'undead', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'select', 'episodes', 'even', 'better', 'episodes', 'given', 'are', 'only', '6', 'first', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'hear', 'cast', 'offer', 'ruminations', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Guts', 'required', 'cast', 'members', 'wear', 'entrails', 'one', 'Walkers', 'order', 'fool', 'thinking', 'were', 'one', 'alas', 'extras', 'are', 'fairly', 'satisfying', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.Overall', 'set', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'show', 'real', 'focus', 'here', 'produced', 'beautifully', 'kickass', 'lossless', 'soundtrack', 'must-have', 'genre', 'fans', 'even', 'non-fans', 'will', 'quickly', 'become', 'addicted', 'gripping', 'exciting', 'show']",N/A

The sheer number of people they have cast as zombies is impressive. The Walking Dead does very well when compared to other zombie films with great action, suspense and tons of gore.  On top of all that is a nice character driven story which holds together quite well with characters that you get to know and like.I went into watching The Walking Dead after hearing a lot of hype around the series and often things just don't live up to that kind of hype.

The second is strong character development, it allows a character build up and you get to feel and hope for the characters. The third is - It is scary like hell. Well built up tension, shock effects - everything is there and done well. If you like scary it will deliver and deliver well. The last is the plot. O.k. Zombie is zombie, but the story is plot driven and builds up.

Honestly, AMC's new series ""The Walking Dead"" (based upon the successful cultish graphic novel series) is, after Breaking Bad and Mad Men, their third show poised to be a remarkable and heavily awarded television series. Graphic in its gore content and violence, the pilot nonetheless presented a plausible and terrifying ""end of the world"" tale that is surprisingly personal with moments of great poignancy.The central character, Georgia Deputy Sheriff Rick Grimes, is shot nearly fatally spending a long (unknown) amount of time lying in a coma, awakening from it and, barefoot and clad only in his hospital gown, stumbles through and emerges out of the hospital to discover a world devastated by some mysterious catylcismic event; a world nearly devoid of life.Once again a fairly unknown British actor takes the lead in an American television series, but having watched Andrew Lincoln as Rick in this series, I fully believe the guy was made for the role (or the other way 'round). For nearly 70 minutes, Lincoln's Rick is mostly on his own, but his face - a magnificent mirror registering every emotion from self doubt, fear, grief, utter despair but also the hope of finding his wife and boy. Lincoln's is a tremendous performance of made all the more remarkable considering the genre and thus a rare opportunity for subtlety and introspection.Rick's interactions with another father and son who capture, but ultimately rescue and aid his return to health, has a deep resonance in a world where men are considered stulted in understanding or expressing their emotions (a topic which is introduced nicely in the shows opening scene with Rick and fellow officer Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal).If you love zombies (and who doesn't?) this new series is a must see.

1389712,ALSTFEQB4RV4J,B0049P1VHS,"Hal L. Doby Jr. ""Computer - Tech Geek""","[1, 1]","What is it about Zomebies that makes them so appealing nowadays? As one that loves the classic monster movies, Zombies are the new kids on the block. They became a hit with the cult-classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" back in 1968. Back then, Zombies were reanimated dead people that had an insatiable craving for human brains. They were slow fumbling ""simple"" folk. As other people made Zombie movies, each writer, director, and producer added their own twists on what it was to be one of the undead. Of crouse the biggest inside joke was that in all the movies, they are never called ""Zombies"".Today, Zombies have a cool factor about them. They have even starred in extremely hilarious cult movies such as Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead, and Fido. Now the cable channel AMC has brought back an entirely new Zombie story and for the first time, they are at the heart of an episodic television show. The first season of ""The Walking Dead"" was truly landmark TV and something TV viewers are so desperate to have. It's unique, compelling, and highly entertaining. My only lament is that the first season was only six episodes long.So what makes it so special? Well for one, like all good science fiction, it's about the human condition and our society set in a fantastic fictional setting. A sheriff is shot in action and slips into a coma. When he wakes up, the hospital has become a wild abandoned haunted house with things that go bump in the night locked behind chained doors. When he gets up and gets out, he discovers his home town almost deserted. He makss a bee line to his home where he discovers his wife and son have packed up thier most precious belongings and fled, He then meets a man and his son that have been surviving the ""zombie-pocolypse"" that bring him up to speed on what's gone on. There has been a deadly virus that once it kills you, it reanimates your body into a mindless flesh-eater. The rumor has it a lot of people have fled to nearby Atlanta for sanctuary, so our Sheriff goes to his local precinct, loads up for bear, and heads for Atlanta. Once there, he meets up with a reg-tag band of survivors and this is where the great dynamic begins.The survivors are a cross-section of Americana, complete with all its flaws. The only thing they have in common is that they want to survive. This is what makes Walking Dead stand out amoung all the other zombie stories. It reminds me of what I thought made the recent version of Battlestar Galactica so great. Its not about the Zombies, its about the human condition. The Zombies are there to present an on-going crisis that compells tha central characters on to confront their frailties and issues. The stories and scripts are so well written, I am going to be quite upset if this off-beat show is not nominated for an Emmy for its writing.Also, it's writers are not afraid to take risks and just like Battlestar, everyone is at risk. People die and they have made it quite clear that no one, even its central characters, are safe from death or zombification. Another thing I quite liked is that so much was packed into these six episodes, it seems like a series that had twice the number of episodes. The pacing is extrordinary and while it's never overpwoering, it moves at a brisk pace. Also, when the last scenes have played out in the final episode of the season, it is a great ending that not only leaves the door open for Season 2, but it clears the slate so that anything can happen.This is must-see TV and I highly reccommend anyone that can get past the concept of Zombies to watch this series.

1389716,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B0049P1VHS,Haunted Flower,"[11, 17]","Based on the comic book by Robert Kirkman, AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" is the first zombie serial made for TV. The story begins with Andrew Lincoln playing Rick Grimes, a Sheriff Deputy who wakes up from a coma in the hospital and finds the zombie apocalypse has taken place around him. He attempts to heal and find his family though it is a struggle just to survive in this new world. The pilot is like a feature-length movie and takes its time setting up the story with amazing tension and visuals.The opening scene is gripping as the Sheriff is attempting to maneuver through tons of abandoned cars as quietly as possible and sees a young blond girl holding a teddy bear walking barefoot. He calls out to her offering assistance and she slowly turns around to reveal wide blue-eyes and a missing bottom jaw, covered in blood. She begins to approach him and he gulps, steadies himself, and begrudgingly shoots her in the head and winces as he knows it will attract more zombies any second.The first two episodes of the six are incredible. They are so suspenseful, the characters are exciting and interesting, and the people have common sense survival skills. Other main actors appearing in this series are Jon Bernthal, Sarah Wayne Callies, Laurie Holden, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Steven Yeun. I won't say who the characters they play are in relation to Rick to avoid spoilers. The zombies are very detailed and disgustingly cool. One memorable zombie only has an upper body and is dragging herself through the grass with entrails behind her. There's a subplot of a father and son duo surviving day to day in the suburbs that can't bring themselves to leave because the mother is wandering around outside as a zombie and they can't leave her or bring themselves to kill her.Rick Grimes once he has his bearings decides to head for the city where there are rumors of a safe zone where people have gathered. He hopes to find his family there but the city turns out to be completely overrun with a zombie infestation. Like I said, the first two episodes -- fantastic! After that...it goes downhill a little bit. The group of characters you meet that have assembled together trying to survive begin to make really poor decisions. This just proves that in the zombie apocalypse scenario, the more people you have, the more danger you are in because someone is going to screw up in the name of being human. Oh, you can't bear to leave the most ignorant, racist jerk on the planet  stuck on a rooftop in the city because he's a person? If you go back for him, he'll probably kill you and you'll lose members of your rescue party! It's painful to watch people do stupid stuff and argue amongst themselves over unimportant things and endanger themselves and others around them in the process.Aside from the stupidity of some characters, the production values are excellent. Every episode feels like part of a big budget movie that keeps going and going and you don't really want it to stop. This show isn't afraid to use silence to establish tension, eeriness, and realism. Then when the music comes in, it is quite a bit more effective.Bonus Features:The Blu-ray menu is SCARY. You see a skyline rotating across the screen and then that little blond girl's back and she slowly turns around and moves toward you, eeeeeek! It makes me want to run right out of the room.""The Making of The Walking Dead"" explains the process of how creator Frank Darabont came across Robert Kirkman's comic books and wanted to make them into a TV series. They strove to find the best actors for the roles but managed to find people who looked quite a deal like the illustrations in the books as well. This featurette goes into production values, makeup, editing and effects, sound, and how they decided to change some of the details of the comic book story in order to be able to surprise the audience.""Inside The Walking Dead"" goes behind the scenes with each individual episode and they talk about their characters, the breakdown of civilization, and the strenuous situations that they undergo. You also get ""A Sneak Peek with Robert Kirkman"" about how the series isn't exactly like the book so that the audience could be kept off balance and there is a featurette on Zombie Makeup tips.There are clips from the San Diego Comic Con Panel with the producers, but it also has the main cast members explaining their roles and the course of the story. Sarah Wayne Callies spends her time on the panel staring at Andrew Lincoln as if she has goo-goo eyes for his accent. They all say the bare minimum, look terrified at the sea of people, but are gracious to be there. Also, there's a trailer on the Blu-ray. There are really good features here for a season with only six episodes and I think they knew that and beefed it up a bit for a better value. The Blu-ray quality is spectacular and it does make me want to tune in for the next season.",3,The Walking Dead - Reviewed by Haunted Flower,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,4904,"['Based', 'comic', 'book', 'Robert', 'Kirkman', 'AMC', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'first', 'zombie', 'serial', 'made', 'TV', 'story', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'playing', 'Rick', 'Grimes', 'Sheriff', 'Deputy', 'who', 'wakes', 'up', 'coma', 'hospital', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'taken', 'place', 'heal', 'find', 'family', 'struggle', 'just', 'survive', 'new', 'world', 'pilot', 'feature-length', 'movie', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'story', 'amazing', 'tension', 'visuals.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'gripping', 'Sheriff', 'attempting', 'maneuver', 'tons', 'abandoned', 'cars', 'as', 'quietly', 'possible', 'young', 'blond', 'girl', 'holding', 'teddy', 'bear', 'walking', 'barefoot', 'out', 'offering', 'assistance', 'slowly', 'reveal', 'wide', 'blue-eyes', 'missing', 'bottom', 'jaw', 'covered', 'blood', 'approach', 'steadies', 'begrudgingly', 'shoots', 'head', 'winces', 'will', 'attract', 'more', 'zombies', 'second.The', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'six', 'are', 'incredible', 'are', 'so', 'suspenseful', 'characters', 'are', 'exciting', 'interesting', 'people', 'have', 'common', 'sense', 'survival', 'skills', 'Other', 'main', 'actors', 'appearing', 'series', 'are', 'Jon', 'Bernthal', 'Sarah', 'Wayne', 'Callies', 'Laurie', 'Holden', 'Jeffrey', 'DeMunn', 'Steven', 'Yeun', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', 'characters', 'play', 'are', 'relation', 'Rick', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'zombies', 'are', 'very', 'detailed', 'disgustingly', 'cool', 'One', 'memorable', 'zombie', 'only', 'upper', 'body', 'dragging', 'grass', 'entrails', 'subplot', 'father', 'son', 'duo', 'surviving', 'day', 'day', 'suburbs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'leave', 'mother', 'wandering', 'around', 'outside', 'zombie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'bring', 'kill', 'her.Rick', 'Grimes', 'once', 'bearings', 'head', 'city', 'where', 'are', 'rumors', 'safe', 'zone', 'where', 'people', 'have', 'gathered', 'find', 'family', 'there', 'city', 'out', 'be', 'completely', 'overrun', 'zombie', 'infestation', 'said', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'fantastic', 'downhill', 'little', 'bit', 'group', 'characters', 'meet', 'have', 'assembled', 'together', 'trying', 'survive', 'begin', 'make', 'really', 'poor', 'decisions', 'just', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'scenario', 'more', 'people', 'have', 'more', 'danger', 'are', 'someone', 'going', 'screw', 'up', 'name', 'being', 'human', 'Oh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'leave', 'most', 'ignorant', 'racist', 'jerk', 'planet', 'stuck', 'rooftop', 'city', 'person', 'go', 'back', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'kill', ""'ll"", 'lose', 'members', 'rescue', 'party', 'painful', 'watch', 'people', 'do', 'stupid', 'stuff', 'argue', 'amongst', 'unimportant', 'things', 'endanger', 'others', 'process.Aside', 'stupidity', 'characters', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'excellent', 'episode', 'feels', 'part', 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'going', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'stop', 'show', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'use', 'silence', 'establish', 'tension', 'eeriness', 'realism', 'Then', 'when', 'music', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'effective.Bonus', 'Features', 'Blu-ray', 'menu', 'SCARY', 'see', 'skyline', 'rotating', 'screen', 'then', 'little', 'blond', 'girl', 'back', 'slowly', 'around', 'eeeeeek', 'want', 'run', 'right', 'room', 'Making', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'process', 'how', 'creator', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'came', 'Robert', 'Kirkman', 'comic', 'books', 'wanted', 'make', 'TV', 'series', 'strove', 'find', 'best', 'actors', 'roles', 'managed', 'find', 'people', 'who', 'looked', 'quite', 'deal', 'illustrations', 'books', 'well', 'featurette', 'production', 'values', 'makeup', 'editing', 'effects', 'sound', 'how', 'decided', 'change', 'details', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'order', 'be', 'able', 'surprise', 'audience', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'scenes', 'individual', 'episode', 'talk', 'characters', 'breakdown', 'civilization', 'strenuous', 'situations', 'undergo', 'also', 'get', 'A', 'Sneak', 'Peek', 'Robert', 'Kirkman', 'how', 'series', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'book', 'so', 'audience', 'could', 'be', 'kept', 'off', 'balance', 'featurette', 'Zombie', 'Makeup', 'are', 'clips', 'San', 'Diego', 'Comic', 'Con', 'Panel', 'producers', 'also', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'explaining', 'roles', 'course', 'story', 'Sarah', 'Wayne', 'Callies', 'time', 'panel', 'staring', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'goo-goo', 'eyes', 'accent', 'say', 'bare', 'minimum', 'look', 'terrified', 'sea', 'people', 'are', 'gracious', 'be', 'there', 'Also', 'trailer', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'features', 'here', 'season', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'think', 'knew', 'beefed', 'up', 'bit', 'better', 'value', 'Blu-ray', 'quality', 'spectacular', 'make', 'want', 'tune', 'next', 'season']",N/A
1389717,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0049P1VHS,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 6]","""When the dead walk, our only hope is each other."" is one of the show's promotional tag lines. Except that sometimes we're a pretty crummy bunch of folks. AMC premiered THE WALKING DEAD on Halloween 2010 and breathes a different sort of life into the zombie apocalypse sub-genre. Robert Kirkman - from whose comic book series this telecast is adapted - won't be rolling over his grave. First, because he's not dead. Second, because AMC does his baby justice in terms of capturing tone and themes. The first episode (""Days Gone Bye"") drew in eight million viewers. That means it's a hit, yo.As in Robert Kirkman's comic book, it's not about the zombies, not really. The zombie infestation serves as the bloodcurdling backdrop, yep. But the focus is on human drama, the highs and lows that man will get up to when the world ends around him. Sheriff's Deputy Rick Grimes is the central figure, mild-mannered and competent and clearly our point-of-view character. After surviving getting shot in the line of duty, Rick wakes up in an abandoned hospital, and we won't get into whether this sequence was ripped off from 28 DAYS LATER or not, because, really, THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS did the hospital wakey-wakey bit first, and did it decades ago. Rick soon enough learns of the zombies, or as the father and son duo who takes him in calls them: the ""walkers."" Horrified at what the world has become, Rick nevertheless sets out to find his family. It's what you and I would do, right? He heads for Atlanta, rumored to be the site of a refugee camp, except that the rumor is all kinds of wrong. But if you weren't yet certain that Rick was the ""hero"" of the piece, then that iconic image of him on his horse wandering down a desolate highway probably did it. Positively John Wayne, that was.It helps that the special effects and the make-up work are so very good. You don't struggle at all with the believability of the shambling revenants. So the bits with the zombies will satisfy the goreheads. But this show, much as in Kirkman's comic book, explores the human condition as it tracks those few humans left. Inevitably, values will be compromised, that underlying social contract sidestepped. If this show follows the course of Kirkman's arc, you're in for dark roads ahead. Getting too fond of the characters isn't advised. Some of them aren't in for a long stay. Some of them will change. Expect several heel turns.There are powerful moments. The first episode alone (""Days Gone Bye"") offers three searing images. We see Morgan Jones (Lennie James, from JERICHO) sighting thru his rifle telescope as he searches for his undead wife. Later, we gaze at a horrifying aerial view of zombies swamping a tank inhabited by a cowering Rick. But maybe the most memorable scene has everything to do with Rick's returning to the park and to that crawling torn-in-half zombie woman. That moment, strangely enough, maybe encapsulates what this show is about. Despair and empathy.It's zombie melodrama; it's character driven. I hope the slow burn approach doesn't throw you off. I do think that some of the characters are plucked from clich&eacute; city, and the featured love triangle is all kinds of old, and that the last four episodes aren't as gripping as the first two. But never mind. As embodied by English actor Andrew Lincoln, Rick Grimes, in his stoic, quiet way, is a compelling character. Born in London, Lincoln emulates that southern drawl quite nicely. (Maybe I'll refrain from mentioning that Andrew Lincoln's real last name is Clutterbuck.) My second favorite character, by the way, is Glenn who is just a likable dude. There aren't a lot of chuckles in this series, but Glenn provides moments of levity.Visceral and graphic, zombies don't quite usher in the sexy the way vampires do; zombies instead bring the icky and the missing bits. But AMC and all involved have put in the work and what they've done is add prestige to this often dismissed genre, sort of what TRUE BLOOD has done for vampires and DEXTER, for serial killers. THE WALKING DEAD is a contemplative - and, sometimes, ponderous - doomsday saga. It is despairing and devastating and, if you keep watching and if it lasts long enough, will shatter your heart a bunch of times. The Walking Dead, if you haven't gotten it yet, doesn't only refer to the zombies.Lastly, I like this show very much, but damn if I'll spend the asking price ($25.99) for a DVD with only six episodes in it.",4,They walk.

1389720,A1LW3XGXYP98BW,B0049P1VHS,H. Pace,"[0, 0]","The Walking Dead is the story of Rick Grimes, a sheriff's deputy who woke up from a coma only to find out a zombie apocalypse had taken place in the interim. The show opens with Rick shooting a zombie, flashes back to the shooting that put him into the coma, and then forward to him waking up. He shortly sets off on a quest to find his family. The Walking Dead is based on the Robert Kirkman comics, but does at times depart significantly from them.After several movies (28 Days Later, I Am Legend) with fast zombies, The Walking Dead returns to slower zombies (but not too slow). The only way to put them down is to kill the brain. A bite will pass the infection. Zombies don't have much to say other than, `AAAAGGGHHH!'The zombies look great. The writers and directors know how to start a scene off on a slow simmer then ratchet up the danger level. The shot of Rick entering a dead Atlanta on horseback was instantly iconic. The opening credits create the perfect mood.Some of its best work is expanding on what is in the comics (e.g., Rick arriving in camp). The medium allows scenes to be drawn out to allow the viewer to really soak in the emotion. Sometimes they push it a bit too far, though (e.g., the fishing scene). A lot of the new stuff is phenomenal as well (e.g., anything with Merle or Daryl). TV allows you to examine your characters and the effect of a zombie apocalypse on human interactions, but the show is sometimes clumsy at doing so. Coupled with the tendency of the characters toward stereotypes, I have the niggling sense that the writers could have created something much better but thought we're too stupid to appreciate it. There is a sad reversion to the horror norm that women only react to danger by screaming helplessly.In another example of ""dumbing down"" for television, we are given significant expository information on the zombie ""infection"" and the collapse of world civilization in an info dump near the end of the season. Presumably driven again by lack of faith in the viewer, the writers sucked a lot of the horror of the unknown out of the show.The writers also get somewhat lazy in their storytelling from time to time. For example, characters exclaim that it is 100 degrees outside the day after a character was complaining about the cold; temperatures in Atlanta don't vary that much from night to day.DVD extras include The Making of the Walking Dead, six Inside the Walking Dead episode guides, A Sneak Peek with Robert Kirkman, Behind the Scenes Zombie Make-Up Tips, Convention Panel with Producers, and The Walking Dead Trailer. They have replaced traditional episode commentaries with short videos (~5-6 minutes each) of the characters and creators talking about the episode interspersed with clips of the episode. This has several advantages over a traditional commentary: it is far less tedious to watch, he keeps the contributors on focus, and it avoids spoilers (you could watch each clip after the corresponding episode).",4,Horror Yarn and Character Drama Rolled into One,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,2979,"['Walking', 'Dead', 'story', 'Rick', 'Grimes', 'sheriff', 'deputy', 'who', 'woke', 'up', 'coma', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'had', 'taken', 'place', 'interim', 'show', 'Rick', 'shooting', 'zombie', 'back', 'shooting', 'put', 'coma', 'then', 'forward', 'waking', 'up', 'shortly', 'off', 'quest', 'find', 'family', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'based', 'Robert', 'Kirkman', 'comics', 'times', 'depart', 'significantly', 'them.After', 'several', 'movies', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Am', 'Legend', 'fast', 'zombies', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'slower', 'zombies', 'not', 'too', 'slow', 'only', 'way', 'put', 'down', 'kill', 'brain', 'bite', 'will', 'pass', 'infection', 'Zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'say', 'other', 'AAAAGGGHHH', ""'The"", 'zombies', 'look', 'great', 'writers', 'directors', 'know', 'how', 'start', 'scene', 'off', 'slow', 'simmer', 'then', 'up', 'danger', 'level', 'shot', 'Rick', 'entering', 'dead', 'Atlanta', 'horseback', 'was', 'instantly', 'iconic', 'opening', 'credits', 'create', 'perfect', 'mood.Some', 'best', 'work', 'expanding', 'what', 'comics', 'e.g.', 'Rick', 'arriving', 'camp', 'medium', 'scenes', 'be', 'drawn', 'out', 'allow', 'viewer', 'really', 'soak', 'emotion', 'Sometimes', 'push', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'e.g.', 'fishing', 'scene', 'lot', 'new', 'stuff', 'phenomenal', 'well', 'e.g.', 'anything', 'Merle', 'Daryl', 'TV', 'examine', 'characters', 'effect', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'human', 'interactions', 'show', 'sometimes', 'clumsy', 'doing', 'so', 'Coupled', 'tendency', 'characters', 'stereotypes', 'have', 'niggling', 'sense', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'created', 'something', 'much', 'better', 'thought', ""'re"", 'too', 'stupid', 'appreciate', 'sad', 'reversion', 'horror', 'norm', 'women', 'only', 'react', 'danger', 'screaming', 'helplessly.In', 'example', 'dumbing', 'down', 'television', 'are', 'given', 'significant', 'expository', 'information', 'zombie', 'infection', 'collapse', 'world', 'civilization', 'info', 'dump', 'end', 'season', 'Presumably', 'driven', 'again', 'lack', 'faith', 'viewer', 'writers', 'sucked', 'lot', 'horror', 'unknown', 'show.The', 'writers', 'also', 'get', 'somewhat', 'lazy', 'storytelling', 'time', 'time', 'example', 'characters', 'exclaim', '100', 'degrees', 'day', 'character', 'was', 'complaining', 'cold', 'temperatures', 'Atlanta', 'do', ""n't"", 'vary', 'that', 'much', 'night', 'day.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'Making', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'six', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'episode', 'guides', 'A', 'Sneak', 'Peek', 'Robert', 'Kirkman', 'Scenes', 'Zombie', 'Make-Up', 'Tips', 'Convention', 'Panel', 'Producers', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'Trailer', 'have', 'replaced', 'traditional', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'short', 'videos', '~5-6', 'minutes', 'characters', 'creators', 'talking', 'episode', 'interspersed', 'clips', 'episode', 'several', 'advantages', 'traditional', 'commentary', 'far', 'less', 'tedious', 'watch', 'contributors', 'focus', 'spoilers', 'could', 'watch', 'clip', 'corresponding', 'episode']",N/A

I was blown away and hooked after the very first episode!  It was so well done, realistic and the acting was stellar!  The zombies and special effects were awesome and the gore was where it should be.  What impressed me was how the show captured the true emotions of people in the unique circumstances that these characters were thrown into.  You could identify with the characters and what they were feeling.  I also liked the rollercoaster of emotions that you felt for certain characters.  At first, you can't stand certain people, then you like them, then you loath them and later they do not seem that bad...  I began telling all of my friends about this program and they loved it too.  Being from Atlanta, it was also interesting to see all the locations that I could recognize.  In my opinion, the series began to lose a tiny bit of steam around the ""Vatos"" episode.  You have to watch to see what I mean.  The CGI could also be improved and may as the budget increases.  The CGI for the zombie headshots was fine, but the explosions were pretty bad.  For example, the grenade in the last episode was pretty weak and the final explosion of the building was laughable (Will not be specific so that I do not spoil anything).  These are picky little details that can be ignored.  This is a 5 star show and I will buy this season for sure!  There were a lot of loose ends at the end of the first season that I wanted to see, at least touched upon.  For instance, what happened to the black father and son who helped the main character?  I really liked those folks and wanted to see more of them.  What happened to the racist jerk from the roof?  Normally I would not care since you have to assume that they will be in season 2.  Unfortunately, there are rumors that Frank Darabont may drop the official writing staff and pursue freelance writers instead.  This would be a horrible idea since it would kill the continuity of the story and characters (If every episode was done by a different writer).  Watch the movie ""The Signal"", which was also filmed in Atlanta and you will see what can happen when you do this kind of thing.  This show is a gem and I really hope that they do not ruin it!

HOWEVER, the zombie genre is waaaaaay down on the bottom of my 'to watch' list.  I've seen them, but personally I don't like them very much, never really have.  Maybe it's because at one time these were human beings.  Heck, even the young aren't spared the possibiltiy of being turned into a rotling.  And, it's never just one zomboid comin' after your arse, but a bagillion at once. The walking dead have always just creeped me out!With that being said my son MADE me watch the first episode.  I was sooooo agitated, uneasy, and hyper darn near yelling at the TV to ""SHOOT IT, SHOOT IT, DON'T GO IN THERE, RUN YOU SOB, RUN!!, DON'T GO DOWN IN THAT PITCH BLACK STAIRWELL, DON'T DO THAT, GO GO GO!!!  (alas, the TV nor the actors ever listen!).  Yet, by the end of the first episode and how it ended, I felt strangely compelled to watch another episode. YEAH.... let's set myself up for more MAJOR squik factors, agitation, and nightmares which are sure to follow!Needless to say, I'm hooked!!  I love this show!  It's so much more than just the rotlings looking for their next snackie. Plus you find yourself saying, ""Oh hell no..... a person wouldn't do this or that"", thereby putting yourself in the situation of how you'd handle yourself in a Zombie Apocalypse.This show definately elicits strong emotional repsonses from the viewing audience, as this core group of survivors do some bone head things.  I think that's why I get agitated & aggrevated, because in a real life survival situation, you wouldn't DO some of the DUMB THINGS they do. No way in hell I'd be going out into the forest to pick mushrooms alone....ALONE!!!! ""Off I trapse, tra la, tra la....."" I'd have more friggin' armed sentry around me than the Queen of England protectin' my butt!!. I'd also be raiding places for silencers, heck, even poor man silencers would do, (noise attracts the rotlings, among other things).  But then if our group of survivors didn't do all these stupid things, we wouldn't have a show, now would we?  I would soooo want Daryl on my side when things go in the pooper!...  Go Team Daryl! He rocks!!  Glen also has a good head on this shoulders.There are excellent character dynamics going on.  You come to care about these folks in their quest for survival.  Some of their behavior will shock and surprise.  But that's what makes this show awesome, you're never really sure what's happening next. The special effects are quite good too. The first season was only 6 episodes long.  A&E; wanted to see how well this show would be received.  Apparently it's been overwhelmingly positive.  Season 2 is following suit, though a little bit slower paced. They didn't have to cram so much into just six episodes, and the mid-season finale for season 2 was a corker!!Even those who get squiked and are squimish about rotlings and all things dead should give this series a try.

Second, the only downfall for me is how short this series is.Now that all that is out of the way, I'll get to why I enjoyed this (possibly too much?).When that whole zombie craze came out a few years back (I was a short while from graduating high school in '06 then), I was very interested in *most* of the zombie-killing flicks (there were a couple that seemed lackluster), and when I saw the trailer for this show, it got me hooked. When I watched it, it completely caught me off-guard for one reason.There wasn't so much gun craze as there was emotion in every episode. It seemed to come in somewhat equaled doses of humanistic emotions and creative kills with a pretty decent storyline with the added perk of a desolated area (zombie-filled dystopia, anyone?) that feels both isolated and give reason to be paranoid before every turn.There's also a nice diversity of characters (though a couple of them don't like ""diversity"" if you know what I mean) with intertwining backgrounds that add to the suspenses and shock throughout this show.Creativity, diversity, humanity, all adding to total insanity I very well enjoyed.

Doing so with the addition of real human drama, life wrenching, soul tearing, audience crying drama, is another thing entirely.  The Walking Dead not only does this, but the six episode first season is a generally compelling story.Much like 28 Days Later, the protagonist (Rick Grimes, played by Andrew Lincoln) for The Walking Dead awakens from a coma in a hospital room without assistance.  Upon departure of the hospital, he learns that the world has fallen into chaos, where the dead have risen to attack and eat the living, filling their ranks with each newly infected victim.  His wandering leads him to Atlanta, a city infested and overrun.  Luckily he unites with a scavenger cell from a group that has staked claim near a massive rock quarry just outside the city.  After mutually helping one another, Rick is welcomed back to the camp that is harboring his wife Lori (Sarah Callies), his young son Carl, and is being led by his former Sheriff's Deputy partner Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal).  The new group must battle the zombies, themselves, each other, and the general despair permeating throughout the world.  Regardless of the impossible premise, it's nearly unfathomable for a viewer not to associate with the characters.And that's just the setting and actors!

However, I found the show to be completely uninteresting, not scary, and poorly acted (I notice that ""bad acting"" is one of the Tag Suggestions below) with terrible dialogue. The Walking Dead is based on a comic book, and perhaps the adaptation was too true to the original: everything about the show seems two-dimensional, and I can imagine it working in a comic book, but it falls flat on the screen. The characters are introduced as archetypes (at best) and stereotypes (at worst) which is a necessary short cut of the comic-book genre, but is just lame on TV. And the direction is manipulative: by episode 2, I could tell that the ""suspenseful setup"" was going to end with a, ""oh good, it wasn't a zombie, it was another member of the party sneaking up on her!"" I purchased the whole season on Amazon On Demand, and by the end of the first episode, my wife and I were left wondering what the heck was supposed to be good or interesting about this acclaimed program. I said I'd give episode 2 ten minutes to provoke my interest, and I watched beyond the point of disinterest, for about half of the episode, and realized that I was just wasting my time. My wife had been insisting ""it must get better!"" but I remember hearing about people loving the show after the first episode, and it just did not appeal to us at all. I guess you can throw zombies in just about anything and a certain, surprisingly large segment of the population will like it.

The show combines elements of the comic's first and second editions, plus adds new material to keep. We get the camp outside Atlanta PLUS it is set in a rock quarry with a lake. We get Morgan and Dune (Rick's early saviors) PLUS their wife/mom, who was missing from the book.  A few new characters - notably Merle, the redneck crossbowman - bring additional zing to the cast, which is notably more diverse than it was in the book.The TV adaptation often improves on the original, giving us time to get to know the characters before they are inevitably chomped by zombies. It also makes more sense of Shane and Lori's relationship before Rick shows up at camp. In the book, Rick and Lori had a perfect relationship - which didn't square with Lori falling for Shane after just a few weeks. The show fixes that problem, and gives us more of the Shane-Rick-Lori love triangle to enjoy. Andrea and Amy get to bond as sisters. Dale sprinkles the fireside chats with Faulkner.I thought I would be put off by the gore (the book was drawn in black and white) but it is bearable - if very intense.

My first reaction was no way, there cant be a tv series about zombies, but then you see there really is. Your next thought becomes why didn't someone do this sooner?Overall this is a very good series with a few small flaws on the side. AMC has shown they are one of the best when it comes to making award winning tv series and I'm sure The Walking Dead will also follow that trend.Where this show slips up a bit is balancing the story and people with the action and zombies. If you go into this show expecting the same as you get out of a video game or other zombie movies, you may be disappointed. On the other hand, they seem to spend a little too much time on the characters and not the action, which can make things boring at times. What makes this show good is the fact that its not just another zombie movie with endless action, but they need to find a little more of a balance.The characters are good all around. They are put into a impossible situation and do a great job of acting that out. I saw the wife beater, the racists, the love triangle, and on and on.

This is just my opinion of the TV series itself.I picked this one from the Amazon Vine program for my husband.  He loves SciFi and Zombie movies.  We watched it together and for me it was a good storyline, but a bit too graphic.  The blood and gore was just too over the top for me and the scene with the horse...well, let's just say if it had not been on dvd I probably would have changed the channel.My husband felt it was just like other Zombie movies where the humans are just trying to survive.  He thought the graphics and the settings were great (amazing actually) and he watched every episode.  He did think that the human aspect and the storylines that they had were pretty good and drew you in.  Basically it was a great emotional Human tale whose enemy just happens to be zombies.I think another viewer said it best that the zombies are secondary to the human aspect.  This is a small group of people trying to survive, be a family, maintain order, and live with the threat of death constantly hanging over their heads.  I think that it is a great group of actors and they do a wonderful job of of portraying ordinary people whose lives have been turned inside out and now they are just trying to live day to day.

In fact, the first episode of ""The Walking Dead"" is a blatant theft of the first chapter of John Wyndham's classic:  Both protagonists suffer an injury that permits them to escape the apocalypse, wake up in a hospital bed, know that something is wrong because the nurse won't come and the clock has stopped, and walk into the light of a world in ashes.  There are in fact so many similarities that ""The Walking Dead"" seems to any reader who's had the pleasure of reading ""Day of the Triffids"" silly and derivative.I also find the acting unbearably melodramatic.  A good director with empathy would have understood that emotional force and reality would have been created if he had his actors understate and under-act their emotional states.  First, that would have been the natural human response -- when faced with danger and intense shock, humans naturally suppress their emotional reactions, thus giving them to analyze the situation and come up with survival strategies.  Second, understatement would have shifted the emotional burden to the audience, making ""The Walking Dead"" a much more frightening experience.I think the unfortunate explanation for the enduring popularity of ""The Walking Dead"" is that it is a silly and derivative television show.  It is a formulaic recollection of popular culture, television show, and movies that people were fond of once.

I particularly liked how the characters (even the minor ones) were testing the boundaries of what is now acceptable in a post apocalyptic world of people making choices.The main reason I didn't give this one five stars is the sixth episode.

With DVD recording systems and DVRs, it is much easier to watch shows on demand. AMC had a marathon on Thanksgiving weekend (2011) and ran all of The Walking Dead ending with the mid-season finale.  I was hooked!  I ordered the complete first season that week.  Love the show!  The conflicts between characters (both living and dead) makes this show great.  Both fortunately and unfortunately, I bought the ultimate edition (with bicycle girl on the cover) while I was visiting my family in Fort Worth, thinking that I would get a better, more expanded experience with the ""dead.""  It was great.  There is more bonus materials that added more ""meat"" to the show (the good part).  The bad part was the quirk I found on my copy when I tried to watch all episodes in order. The scene with the ""guts"" was deleted! When I watched it again episode by episode, the scene miraclously appeared. Creation of super-expanded versions of the same shows or movies are a common complaint many people have with the company Anchor Bay (distributors of these DVDs). Only ice cream cones should be double dipped (hint: Anchor Bay). Lazy people like me don't like having to hit the play button more than once (LOL).  The ""walker autopy"" was a crucial segment to that story line and Anchor Bay was to blame for ""butchering"" that episode. A real let down for die-hard fans of the genre. Another thing I found strange was the commentary track with Robert Kirkman and Emma Bell on episode 104 (Vatos).  Kirkman mentioned a conflict with T-Dog actor Irone Singleton.  I'm not sure if the altercation was verbal or physical but judging by how little screen time T-Dog got in Season Two, I got the impression that the conflict wasn't truly resolved.  Many people on the Twitter buzz who have watched Season Two have complained on AMC's website that T-Dog's character has had little if no screen time with one maybe two lines every other episode.  Some have relagated him to ""token status.""  I wonder if it had anything to do with the conflict.

While most drama in this genre (like many others) is driven by contrived circumstances usually the narrative is engaging enough that this becomes less overt and almost unnoticeable. Sadly in the case of ""the Walking dead"" the simplistic and contrived plot points blend pointlessly and uninterestingly into one another and then are then sprinkled with absurdity and banality.  The story literally advances as you expect every step of the way, there is no interesting dialog, action, or interaction between characters, the environment, or even among story lines.  A character is presented, his role immediately identified, and his story arc predicted with near certainty.  It's not particularly entertaining to watch the uninspired characters, their inane behavior, or the 3rd grade dialog unfold when you already know the underwhelming conclusion.  Worse still, the band of characters are forgettable and essentially boring, Han Solo and Bobafet may be one dimensional but at least they're interesting.  Even Shrek had layers. Watching this show is an exercise in tedium, I kept waiting for it to get interesting, but that never happened.  I watched the whole first season and it seemed that at some point it might become interesting, plus it's well reviewed by people who clearly think it is interesting, but much like a side scroller you can solve with button mashing your time is likely better spent on another original series out there that is more then a few steps from terrible, or at least engaging.",2,"Predictable & uninspired writing, dull acting, no idea why this show is popular.",1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,1625,"['As', 'much', 'personally', 'love', 'post', 'cataclysm', 'zombie', 'setting', 'series', 'just', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'enough', 'watch', 'most', 'drama', 'genre', 'many', 'others', 'driven', 'contrived', 'circumstances', 'usually', 'narrative', 'engaging', 'enough', 'less', 'overt', 'almost', 'unnoticeable', 'Sadly', 'case', 'Walking', 'dead', 'simplistic', 'contrived', 'plot', 'points', 'blend', 'pointlessly', 'uninterestingly', 'one', 'then', 'are', 'then', 'sprinkled', 'absurdity', 'banality', 'story', 'literally', 'expect', 'step', 'way', 'interesting', 'dialog', 'action', 'interaction', 'characters', 'environment', 'even', 'story', 'lines', 'character', 'presented', 'role', 'immediately', 'identified', 'story', 'arc', 'predicted', 'near', 'certainty', 'not', 'particularly', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'uninspired', 'characters', 'inane', 'behavior', '3rd', 'grade', 'dialog', 'unfold', 'when', 'already', 'know', 'underwhelming', 'conclusion', 'Worse', 'still', 'band', 'characters', 'are', 'forgettable', 'essentially', 'boring', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Bobafet', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'dimensional', 'least', ""'re"", 'interesting', 'Even', 'Shrek', 'had', 'layers', 'Watching', 'show', 'exercise', 'tedium', 'kept', 'waiting', 'get', 'interesting', 'never', 'happened', 'watched', 'whole', 'first', 'season', 'seemed', 'point', 'might', 'become', 'interesting', 'well', 'reviewed', 'people', 'who', 'clearly', 'think', 'interesting', 'much', 'side', 'scroller', 'can', 'solve', 'button', 'mashing', 'time', 'likely', 'better', 'spent', 'original', 'series', 'there', 'more', 'then', 'few', 'steps', 'terrible', 'least', 'engaging']",N/A

In fact, I became a fan of the comics after I watched the show.This is one of the few TV shows that I watch anymore and I look eagerly look forward to the show every Sunday and dread it when every season ends.What I like about the show: The production value is excellent, AMC sure spared no expense when filming it. Everything is done well, crafted well and made well on the show and shot well. The producers really spent their time making sure everything is top notch. Secondly, I thought the casting was great - there are no big names here bar one (Merle) but all the actors are excellent in their roles and totally believable.What I don't like about the show: There is too too much dialoging. The first episode starts off with a really long chat between Rick and Shane in their patrol car and really that was too long. And the long dialogs between characters continues throughout the series. I'm sure the directors are trying to give the characters more character, but I'm also sure that can be done through action. Maybe the producers felt the same way because almost the entire staff of writers was fired after the season. This is the reason why I only give my review 4 stars.Other: Fans of the comics will know that the TV series does not follow the comics faithfully. I'm kind of ambivalent about that. The creator of the series has said that it is done this way so the TV show isn't predictable to those who read the comics, and over time I've come to agree with that.Overall, a really excellent show, great for fans of who like this genre.

The main story is about a zombie apocalypse, but that is where it starts, it goes way beyond that to a basic survival story. Without getting into the story too much it traces the story of an ordinary man (a sheriff) who's life is thrown into chaos when he is shot on duty and goes into a coma. when he wakes after the apocalypse he is searching for his family (wife and son) and what he discovers is horrifying.I started watching this show from episode 1 and that's how you need to see it.

IT APPEARS THAT SOME ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH THE ENTIRE FOOTAGE (3+ MINUTES OR SO) CONCERNING THE GROUPS TAKING INDOORS ""WAYNE DULAP"", THE DEAD, WALKER. THIS FOOTAGE OF GORE AS THE GROUP HACKS AWAY AT HIM WITH AN AXE IN GRAPHIC DETAIL. I TOO HAVE SEEN THIS DELETION. BUT, YOU CAN SEE IT ALL! A SIMPLE CHANGE AS TO HOW YOU BEGIN WATCHING THE FIRST DISC IS KEY. SIMPLY VIEW EACH EPISODE AS A SINGLE EPISODE IN ITSELF. RATHER THAN CLICKING ""PLAY ALL."" TO VIEW EACH EPISODE AS A SINGLE PLAY, YOU WILL SEE EVERY FRAME OF INTENDED GORE AND BLOOD! OR AS REAL AS IT WAS INTENDED! I HOPE THIS CLEARS THE MISCONCEPTIONS OF ""MISSING FOOTAGE.""As a Verified Amazon Purchased item, I can attest to this with my honesty and heart. Growing up on the original ""Night of the Living Dead"", that movie scared me for years. To this day, it still sends shivers down my spine. In fact, the only thing that truly gets my heart pounding in fright, is the dead coming back to life! For decades hundreds of movies have imitated, but never duplicated that 1968 low-budget film. One man's view took others with him and the select few became giants in the industry in their own right. Tom Savini was Romero's make-up & special effects artist on NOTLD and he branched off to make the dead more real in his views. Another man, Greg Nicottero, followed Savini, and in time, along with Howard Berger, became the predominant forces when it came to bringing the dead to life. Fast forward to 2010.When I heard whispers at Horror Conventions that the Graphic Novel I loved, ""The Walking Dead"" would be picked up by AMC for a single, 6 episode season, I knew my dreams of NOTLD had come full circle. Having met Mr. Romero on several occasions, I had asked him of his thoughts on the TV jump? He just said, ""If anyone can pull this off, Greg can."" That was golden for me. But how does one take a comic of sorts and turn it into a TV series?AMC gave the go-ahead for an unprecedented attempt to where TV had not gone before. No different than Star Trek and the realms it charted. Wow. Was I shocked and happily worth the 50 year wait!Robert Kirkman's take on the ""Undead"" was and is breathtaking. While there are certain differences between the Graphic Novel & TV show, some subtle, others much more outright, ""The Walking Dead Season 1"" was absolutely brilliant! Sure, the first episode mirrors ""28 Days Later"" as Rick Grimes awakes from a coma to find the world has turned upside down, he remains true to his Sheriff's law abiding ways. As well as a man seeking his wife and son. Only to find every BODY he passes is either ""put down"" or NOT! As he arrives to his home, his life, you see what I believe any of us would do. Collapse. He breaks down as he realizes that all he knew is no more, but with a grip on ""maybe?"" He patrols outdoors to his former neighbors home. Only to be whacked with a shovel by an even more scared Duane. Only a child himself trying to deal with DEAD PEOPLE NOT STAYING DEAD! As Rick regains his wits for a sec, he sees Morgan with a muzzle in his face. Wait? Isn't Rick the Sheriff? No wonder he passes out! We as the audience do not need the growing ensemble cast yet. Rick needs to learn about the new reality first, first hand. The brief cut-aways at his prior gun shot are necessary for US to learn about him. Rick learns of the world from Morgan and Duane. All the while Morgans pathetic wife mopes just outside because Morgan himself still hasn't come to terms yet. And he is 1 month into this insanity!All in this first episode, the 3 members must deal with this together. Yet prepare to go separate ways. An amazing moment when Morgan has his new rifle that Rick gave him. One full month on of his morbid wife lurking outside the front door, and the Human Element keeps him from putting her down. He knows she is dead. It is the right thing to do. But the LOVE keeps him from pulling that trigger. Duane knows the moment is near and covers his ears and cringes with fright! Morgan hesitates. He is not ready to deal with the ""Walking Dead."" Fore his wife is not his wife anymore. Given the chance, she would tear into his flesh in a sec! Rick drives off in a Sheriff's car in search of Lori and Carl. He KNOWS they made it. He hangs onto this simple yet strong notion. If not, then all hope is truly lost! All in the first episode!I shall not go on about the remaining 5 episodes of Season 1. By now, I'm sure most of you have either seen them or know about them. Many on here have written much as I. Yes, some hate the premise of Zombies altogether. I say to them, just don't watch, don't read this and change the channel. As Bruce Springstien sang, ""500 channels and nothing to watch."" I'm sure there is. As for myself and Millions of loyal Undead fans, THIS is exactly what we have been waiting for.All thanks to George A. Romero and his original vision of ""NIGHT OF THE FLESH EATERS."" I'm so glad that name never took!I am highly recommending this set in Blu-Ray! To watch this in the best possible clarity and sound is like nothing else! I have also purchased ""The Walking Dead Seasons 2&3"" on Blu-Ray as well. I shall be leaving follow-up reviews for them as well. By far, aside from the original ""Star Trek Series"", AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" is the BEST thing on cable television...",5,"Zombies for this generation... hats off to Romero!

1389799,A1ZJJWF69R31ZL,B0049P1VHS,"Kate Fredericks ""Kate""","[1, 1]","Once again, I am adding my voice to already hundreds of reviews because it can't hurt the series or Amazon to have another avid fan rate it 5-stars. The Walking Dead isn't for everyone. I will start by warning you it is just about the most graphically gory show allowed on 1st tier cable. And if that gore was done for the sake of bringing in the teenage crowd, I would not watch it.So, let me try to convince you that if that sort of thing is always your basis for not watching a show, then not only are you missing the point, but you are missing arguably the best show on TV (at least as good as Homeland and Sons of Anarchy). The blood and gore is a function of the reality the people left alive after the ""zombie virus"" has decimated society and must endure to stay alive. It's not a perfect show, and occasionally I see things writers do for plot's sake, but those moments are few.When I first read that our hero, Rick Grimes is played by Andrew Lincoln who hales from London, England (just an aside, anybody else think between Canada, the UK, and Australia that the all -American actor is a thing of the past? ), I admit my jaw dropped. I am one of those who can honestly say I am an original fan. I have watched Dead weekly from the very first episode until last night's episode. Somewhere in the second season, I looked Rick up on Imbd and found out this great actor with that perfect Georgian drawl actually speaks with a fairly prissy English accent! (Which like most American women normally find quite sexy.) I cannot imagine what it must be like to be one of the actors on this set. All that to say Mr. Lincoln's portrayal of Rick is the standard all actors should aspire to. The cast is lengthy and in the first season changes out quite a bit. I'd like to name each one, but that would be ridiculously redundant on this thread.If you haven't watched the series yet, and can suspend your normal reaction to the goriness of Dead - seriously - start with this season (1) and enjoy TV so good, the fare offered at the movie theaters has very rarely surpassed this one. I have to say that Season 1 was genius in how real it stayed with characters, surroundings, and story. In my opinion, society would devolve into a very messy thing under these circumstances. As one who likes an apocalyptic storyline, I also rarely find any of them to be particularly good or realistic. The Walking Dead ALWAYS keeps it real. With characters you fall in love with, expect to keep tissues handy throughout the season. BUY IT! And do buy the best viewing (blu-ray right now) version of it. Makes excellent Christmas presents for fans and NEWBIES who keep saying they'd like to watch it but are too busy. You can't go wrong (knowing you are buying for adults - I personally would not let anyone under the age of 16 watch this - extreme adult content). I know money is tight for many people these days, and I would not push a show that wasn't truly top-notch for that reason. This one is already highly popular with (I hope) many seasons to come. Just an addendum here - the TV series and first season was Frank Darabount's baby. He completely stepped out at the end of season 1. But if you want to know the effect that had on Season 2 and most way through 3 - you'll have to read my reviews of those!  Season 1 - best of the best.

1389809,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0049P1VHS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[18, 27]","When I heard that AMC was going to produce a television series based on the zombie epic ""The Walking Dead,"" I was both concerned and delighted. A bona fide classic in undead lore, Robert Kirkman's ""The Walking Dead"" graphic novels are brutal and surprising--not really what I would picture for a basic cable TV show (the first season is only 6 episodes, we'll see where it goes from there). But AMC has produced terrific and prestigious shows like ""Mad Men"" and ""Breaking Bad,"" so I was pretty stoked to see what they do with this. Add Frank Darabont of ""Shawshank Redemption"" fame as the creative force behind the show, and I'm pleased to report that we've got a winner!For years, I've maintained that the principle themes of Kirkman's vision have little to do with actual monsters. This is a story of human survival, of morality, of loyalty, of sacrifice--of doing anything necessary to carry on without losing the basics of what makes life worth living. The fact that this is occurring within the midst of a zombie apocalypse is just a bonus! Darabont and team are fully on board with the notion that it is humanity, not the undead, driving this epic struggle. So while ""The Walking Dead"" expertly crafts its horrors, the real emotional weight is conveyed through its characters and the decisions they face on a daily basis.The story in these six episodes, for the most part, adheres to the first few individual comics or the collected ""Volume One: Days Gone By."" This is the series' jumping off point--and, in truth, sets things up in a fairly typical way. After being involved in a shoot-out, cop Rick awakes from a coma isolated, but not alone, in a local hospital. Apparently, in the time he was out, something has shifted in the world and now the dead walk. The program introduces Rick and many other principles as he tries to figure out what is happening while he crosses the state to locate his family. On the outskirts of Atlanta, Rick is reunited with his wife Lori, son Carl, and police partner Shane with a group of other survivors. I was afraid, with so much story to draw from, Darabont might rush things. Instead, ""The Walking Dead"" takes its time setting up the premise, introducing the cast, and establishing a bleak new world. It is a tremendous accomplishment that really allows the viewer to identify with the action, to become emotionally connected with the horror.There are a few diversions from Kirkman's text, but they actually enhance the drama. I particularly enjoyed the introduction of one of the series' greatest villains at a much earlier point--rounding off his back story for a reemeergence in the future. With such a large cast, the standouts in the beginning have got to be the leads--Andrew Lincoln as Rick and Jon Bernthal as Shane. Hopefully, should there be a second season, more of the supporting cast will get to shine--but their early contributions are uniformly fine. Lincoln displays an intriguing balance of strength and vulnerability, but it's Bernthal who is the break-out star for me! The gore and effects are absolutely top notch and should be appreciated by horror aficionados. Those that love zombie mayhem should have more than enough to whet their appetite. But, and this I stress, ""The Walking Dead"" is sophisticated, adult entertainment that should appeal to viewers who might not ordinarily target this genre as well. This is just great TV, plain and simple, and something unexpected fresh (if you can call rotting flesh fresh) on the TV landscape.

I am pleased to report this DVD collection didn't let me down. It is easily one of the best series I've seen in quite some time. From the 90 minute pilot episode to episode 6's dramatic conclusion, 'The Walking Dead' grabbed my attention in its gnashing, rotting teeth and didn't let me go! The production quality is more like that of a movie; as is the levels of gore, violence and mature content. However, these are not extraneous and only serve to further the plot.As you've probably heard by this point, 'The Walking Dead' is a story where most of the population has become zombies and there are groups of ragtag survivors trying to find some answers and survive as best they can. It has a horror theme, but it is more of a human drama than anything else. The zombies serve as a plot device to test the character of the main players, exposing their strengths as well as their flaws. The casting is spot on and the characters believable and relatable. The second of the two DVDs has a lot of behind-the-scenes / making-of extras and I was surprised to learn that the lead actor who plays police officer Rick Grimes is British. Andrew Lincoln becomes the Georgia law man so thoroughly, you'd never guess. The rest of the ensemble is equally convincing in their varied roles.The Walking Dead is will probably not please all viewers. The level of explicit violence is pretty high, though appropriate considering the subject matter. People stop being nice and do what they have to do to survive when civilization breaks down (I hope I never find out). There are some scenes where the story's continuity breaks down but nothing too detracting. And there is only 6 episodes - I'm left wanting more! Well, season 2 is due to begin in about 3 months and this time we get 13 episodes. I'm tempted to wait for it to come out as a set though. Watching all of a season 1's shows back-to-back was just too engrossing of an experience.

1389820,A387HWHHYFIA92,B0049P1VHS,Kyle Johnson,"[16, 24]","The first season of AMC's The Walking Dead was subject to a great deal of speculation, hype, and varying degrees of opinion.  There were some who thought the hype was too much and that, despite the right components being in place, the show would fail to meet every expectation laid out for it.  And there were those who felt that The Walking Dead would break onto the scene and immediately launch itself into the stratosphere of history's greatest television shows while simultaneously reconfiguring the public-at-large's opinion of the horror genre.  And, in the end, neither side was truly right.  But what is clear is this: The Walking Dead is excellent fare that has occasion to be uneven, but it's tempered in such a way that it takes its time with the characters and never becomes dull or wanders aimlessly.  While not the greatest show on television, never mind not being the best show on its network, The Walking Dead is wonderful and innovative television that horror buffs and drama fans alike can stand beside proudly.As someone who has read the entire run of the comic series to current, I can safely say that Frank Darabont, Robert Kirkman, and the production team around them manage to hit on the important aspects of the comics and translate them with great efficiency.  What they also manage to do successfully is introduce a number of new locales and characters, and deviate (quite distinctly, more often than not) from the source material without infringing on the tone, rather adding layers to the story and planting seeds for future arcs and many happy (or quite the opposite) returns down the road.  The Walking Dead strikes an almost perfect balance for adapting a work, expertly recreating powerful scenes that made the comic the success that it is while using artistic license from the considerable talents involved and tweaking the formula in ways conducive to the television format.  When the credits roll on the sixth and final episode, the landscape is one considerably different from where the comic left readers after six issues.  And that is a comforting thing, as prolonging events (or even altogether avoiding them) that transpire in that first arc allows tension to metastasize and characters to flourish.The heart of The Walking Dead is, as it is in the comic, the characters.  All of the primaries are dutifully played: Rick Grimes, the central protagonist imbued with a natural leadership, is portrayed with conviction and by Andrew Lincoln.  The first episodes focus particularly on him and his struggle to locate his wife, Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies), and their son, Carl (Chandler Riggs).  Shane is represented wonderfully with an additional air of menace by Shane Bernthal, who never goes over the top in rendering the character as one on a particularly precarious edge while maintaining the believability that he is, more often than not, a good man and a devoted friend.  There seems to be more to do with Lori in the early going here when compared with the comic, and Callies is up to the task, portraying Lori as a strong woman focused on survival, and the deeper exploration of the questionable relationship between her and Shane is made even more potent by their performances.  Carl's role is a bit suppressed when compared to the comic, but Riggs handles him well and should serve the role well in later episodes.What The Walking Dead does extremely well is allow the performers to bring these characters to life, and that extends to the large part of the supporting cast.  Jeffrey DeMunn's Dale is the calm, sage-like center, often providing the voice of reason in the wake of the show's darkest moments, and DeMunn plays him with passion and power.  Laurie Holden is at her best as Andrea, brimming with real, tangible emotion, particularly in the episodes ""Vatos"" and ""Wildfire,"" bringing a suitable grace to scenes that pack a heavy emotional punch.  Few stones are left unturned, and almost every member of the group of survivors is given nuance.  There is very little in the way of cannon fodder characters, and even tertiary characters are given careful consideration.  Lennie James' turn as Morgan Jones in ""Days Gone Bye"" is one that nearly steals the episode away from the main players and certainly calls for a return and a more prominent role in later episodes.But that isn't to say all characters involved are perfect: Ed Peletier (Adam Minarovich) is little more than a stock domestic monster, and has little to do with his screen time aside from repulsing the viewer as a relatively by-the-numbers wife beater cliche.  Merle Dixon is played well by the always exceptional Michael Rooker, but the character is relatively hollow, a racist archetype, who is introduced in the midst of something of a breakdown, spewing racial epithets and endangering (and outright assaulting) other survivors.  Rooker's acting (and a bit of timely dialogue) saves the character in the cold open to ""Tell It to the Frogs,"" leaving the hope that the character will return with more complexity and allow Rooker to display his talents further.What is impressive about The Walking Dead is the verisimilitude with which it carries itself.  It plays things razor straight and never deviates into needless exhibition of blood and guts.  And for all the emphasis on character and acting, enough cannot be said about the work done by Gregory Nicotero and KNB EFX, rendering the living dead and the gory details in as realistic a manner as possible.  And, at times, the show moves at such a pace that one may forget that it is just that: a show about the zombie apocalypse.  This is why the show succeeds.  It never deemphasizes character in favor of the living dead, rather using the latter as a means to punctuate the story.  It succeeds as wonderful television because it can go for nearly entire episodes without utilizing that selling point.  There is so much intrigue surrounding the survivors and their stories that when the ""walkers"" show up, it is not to simply punch things up with some zombies.  Rather, it is a reminder that these very human problems are capitulated by the threat of the living dead and the crushing reality of the end of humanity.  ""Vatos"" serves as an exceptional example of this, particularly the ending, using misdirection to make the viewer dread people and what they are capable of before the viewer is reminded of the very real danger of the living dead.Through six episodes, The Walking Dead relies on extremely compelling performances and pretty exceptional writing and directing, though it occasionally lacks punch, particularly in the wake of the strength of the Darabont-directed first episode.  The finale does enough to draw toward the second season, which has quite a bit to live up to.  But for the occasional unevenness, the first season of The Walking Dead powers along and serves as something of a screen test for a longer second season.  A test that it passed with flying colors, audiences and critics alike eating it up.  The first season leaves its audience wanting more, and it makes for exciting, fresh TV and one of the brightest new series to spring up in some time.  Fans of the horror genre, as well as compelling television drama such as AMC's own Breaking Bad and Mad Men, should be proud, as The Walking Dead bridges the gap between a well-worn sub-genre and expert storytelling.",4,A Satisfying Blend of Horror and Storytelling,1292371200,"12 15, 2010",2010,7370,"['first', 'season', 'AMC', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'was', 'subject', 'great', 'deal',

But, with every zombie movie, it must end.. or it just gets dragged on, IE Resident Evil.If you're in my shoes, trust me you will LOVE this series. It is simply amazing. Just as a little FYI this series is based off the comic books The Walking Dead created by Robert Kirkman and artist Tony Moore.First off, I love the characters, and I also love that their story is unpredictable. In a movie you can basically tell who is going to live and who is going to die. In this series its up in the air; if there is any one character you expect to live you may be surprised. Not to mention the fact that they're all really great actors. My favorite characters are Rick Grimes, whom the story primarily focuses on (played by Andrew Lincoln.) His journey into this new world overtaken by zombies begins in a hospital bed. He has been neglected after a gun shot wound, and walks out into the real world to find everything he loves is gone. Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker) is another character to watch out for. He's a military vet, and is handcuffed to a metal pole as impending doom is knocking at his door (literally.) Don't worry though, he finds a way to survive... by removing his own body part. And finally you have Glenn (Steven Yeun) who provides comic relief to the characters as they are enduring the Zombiecolypse, hahaAnother thing to watch for: the zombies themselves. My fiance and I agreed the zombies in this series are probably one of the best special effect make-up we've ever seen. They truly are a work of art, something you have to see for yourself. Not to mention the fact that the zombies must be killed by destroying the brain, and the show spares no expense showing the viewers the gruesome scenes.This isn't your typical zombie movie. These people are trying to survive during the zombie attacks... and just when you think they're safe.......... well, see for yourself :)The only negative that I have about this series is that it is wayyyy too short. This is normally why I only purchase series when I know they are done filming, and I can buy a complete set... and not have to wait until October 2011 to see what happens!

Only one of them carries a gun, and it's only a revolver (six shooter).The camp consists of tents pitched anywhere. There's no sense of attempting to fortify themselves at all against attack. The tents are pitched well away from their vehicles. IF the zombies attacked they'd be wiped out in minutesIn a nation of major gun ownership the fact that only one guy has one gun with him is just stupid.Second is the Sheriff's deputy - a survivor on the way to Atlanta.He got a tiny petrol can - perhaps only 5 gallons. And that's it. Not even a back-up can.He too walks around with a six-shooter, though sometimes he takes a shotgun out of the boot - what good it is there is beyond me.I am amazed at this poor writing. Even if you watch ""The Colony"" a post-apocalyptic `reality show' they took with them more supplies.The deputy, when he stumbles into the city and is surrounded by zombies makes his way into a abandoned tank.

1389838,A19B0WUZCH8I4R,B0049P1VHS,Lionheart,"[2, 3]","Here is a classic case of a show feeling its way along from a great premise, and some interesting moments, to its much better groove (the succeeding season, seasons). Which could be said for so many other television shows. It usually takes quite a while to get the real creative juices going, doesn't it? Just to offer a few examples: how terrible were the first seasons of Star Trek: TNG, and the X-Files, respectively?The Walking Dead, Season One, really only proves how there is usually a freshman jinx involved with classic television shows. The opening episode, for example, is hardly original: we saw it all before in 28 Days Later, didn't we? A guy wakes up in a hospital only to find the world has become a post-apocalyptic zombie hellscape while he's been away. Some neat twists on the theme do not take away from the fact that it is a stolen idea. From more than one place, it turns out: Stephen King wrote similar scenes as this in The Stand. Remember Stu Redman?The rest of the season is not very surprising; various and sundry encounters with the undead and the presentation of survivors, none of which is particularly interesting. A low budget also meant a reliance on computer-generated graphics, so that the zombie deaths usually resemble something you could catch in a Resident Evil videogame.We never see the most interesting part of the apocalpyse, which is the transition from one world to the next. It's just the next, and you have to imagine the rest. Disappointing. Or rather, it did not have to be disappointing, but it is, due to a lack of originality.Today's audience is also accustomed to zombie horror, so that many of the scenes here, pivotal sequences in the episodes, just aren't very striking -- such as Rick's (the protagonist's) encounter with a hoard of undead in Atlanta. We've seen all of this stuff before, and so it is hardly worth a glance.And the fact is, if this was all the show turned out to be about, it would be terrible. Instantly forgettable. Like a toned-down version of Night of the Living Dead. And there would certainly be no reason to keep turning it on week after week.But it isn't just about zombies, that's the thing. It's about fully-developed, dramatically real characters inhabiting a zombie-world -- and that is new. Basically, what we have is the zombie universe treated for the first time since Romero's original film in the 60's as a serious stage on which the human condition can be played out.We quickly realize that this is less about the scares and the killing, the dim lighting and the horror, than it is about the people involved in it. The interest arrives with the elucidation of character (which does not happen enough here to earn a higher rating from me, but which does happen).Few of the scenes I liked involved zombies, actually. My favorite was the abandoned Dixon brother on the rooftop in Atlanta, his psychological struggle with God/fate/himself as he was dying of exposure. Very well done, a great performance based on the bedrock of a wonderful script. Romero never directed anything so beautiful. Other good ones involved Shane and Rick's emotionally divided son.The stories show glimpses of what they will eventually become, once the writers become fully immersed in the characters. Not great, but very good in certain instances, especially the dialogue. Not a lot of trite lines here, no signs of inexperienced screenwriters ...It's a very intelligent experience, overall, especially in the last few episodes. The lines given to the group's conscience, Dale, are frequently wonderful. Worth the price of admission. The over-arching themes of the series are introduced fairly well, and in a convincing manner. So again, it is not the zombie stuff that intrigues, but the deeper layers. For example, if there is no hope, if this is mankind's ""extinction event,"" then what, exactly, are these people plodding on for? And of course the survival of the body/versus the survival of the human soul thing (again embodied in many of Dale's dialogues).I only give it three stars because the setting is given preference here, instead of the characters ... because it is still all being set up. The show gleams wonderfully when it is about the characters and the choices they face, the loves and hatreds they habor. But it sinks when focusing on the ""walkers."" Because again, we've seen all that before.But the writers are clever. They understand that before the viewer can give a damn about who gets eaten or attacked by a zombie, he/she must first become involved in a character's plight ... and in a movie? You just don't have time to do that sort of thing. A few minutes backstory per character, and you better hope you succeed, or the whole movie fails.Here they have time, and they take it. They build these characters brick by brick, and as convincingly as anything you'll find in even Emmy-award winning shows.But again, all is set-up, a finding of the way, a searching through fog-enshrouded trees for a proper path. It's a good start, but I maintain that only in the next season do they really begin to get it right.The final two episodes are disappointing, though intellectually stimulating. A CDC scientist, at the end of his tether, tries to murder the group, or encourage their mass suicide, however you choose to look at it. Either way, it's contrived. And almost certainly factually inaccurate, as far as the real CDC in Atlanta is concerned. It involves the destruction of the entire facility, when only the destruction of the labs (including any stores) would do. And the final blow-up is computer-generated nonsense, almost laughable in its look.",3,Buy the Second Season,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,5638,"['Here', 'classic', 'case', 'show', 'feeling', 'way',

1389851,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0049P1VHS,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","It seems that horror films have changed drastically over the past few years. Where once there was a cycle that lasted about ten years between horror films being popular, they seem to be more mainstream now than ever. Not only tlat, the horror genre has kicked into gear crossing over into other areas as well. Books like THE ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE, zombie movies galore and finally the comic book series that has now made its way to TV and DVD: THE WALKING DEAD.Based on the hit comic book series that continues to this day, this zombie outing is unlike any other in most ways. True the beginning of the series seems a bit like 28 DAY LATER, but once you get past that it's one of the most original zombie tales ever filmed. And unlike most it doesn't focus near as much on the zombies as it does on the survivors.The series starts with officer Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) being shot and put into a coma. When he wakes, he discovers no one is left on his floor of the hospital and most rooms on the floor tossed and turned. As he slowly makes his way through the white corridors, he comes across a chained double door with a warning of what lies beyond spray painted.Finding clothes and setting out to locate his family, Grimes sees nothing but devastation in any direction he looks. Crashed helicopters and cars are everywhere but no sign of people. Outside the hospital are row upon row of sheet covered corpses. What's happened?On Grimes trek to his home, he sees up close what has happened. Though unable to believe his eyes, a half rotted corpse drags itself across the grass. Grimes takes the bicycle that apparently belonged to the corpse and heads home only to be knocked unconscious by someone living there.A man and his son are staying in a house nearby Grimes old home, since vacated by his wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) and son Carl (Chandler Riggs). He explains what happened, though as with most zombie films we have no idea what caused it to happen. He shows Grimes how the zombies walk the streets, attracted by noise and searching for the living to feed off of.It's not long before Grimes helps the man and his son by taking them to the local police station and arming them heavily as well as providing them a place to shower. The station has its own emergency energy source giving them light and hot water. Grimes heads towards Atlanta in search of his family, sharing a walkie talkie with the man on the chance he makes it there later on.But this is only a part of the story. As Grimes begins his search, we see his partner Shane (Jon Bernthal) among a group of survivors banded together. In this group are Grimes wife and son. And Shane and Grimes wife are now a couple. Eventually we know their paths will meet.The best part of this show is that the story revolves around people, struggling to survive in a world gone mad. The depth of the show presents us with realistic scenarios of what people would do, how they might react, giving us the more human element of the story rather than focusing on the gore and zombies alone. It is this tale of emotions and the basic instinct for survival that separates this tale from most zombie movies.Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of zombies to be seen and enough gore to keep those fans happy. KNB effects have done another outstanding job here. And scenes like a downtown street in Atlanta filled with zombies moving towards our hero truly make your skin crawl.Tested with just a few episodes the show was a dynamite hit for AMC and was quickly renewed for a second season much longer than the first. Until that season airs, fans will have to be content with the DVD release of season one. Horror fans will find this a must have for their collection. Movie fans will enjoy the horror film done right. And those just curious will find more than they bargained for from a horror series. Well made, well acted, directed with style and featuring a story that unwraps slowly make this one well worth owning in your collection.",5,THEY LIVE!,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,3992,"['horror', 'films', 'have', 'changed', 'drastically', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Where', 'once', 'was', 'cycle', 'lasted', 'ten', 'years', 'horror', 'films', 'being', 'popular', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'mainstream', 'now', 'ever', 'Not', 'only', 'tlat', 'horror', 'genre', 'kicked', 'gear', 'crossing', 'other', 'areas', 'well', 'Books', 'THE', 'ZOMBIE', 'SURVIVAL', 'GUIDE', 'zombie', 'movies', 'galore', 'finally', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'now', 'made', 'way', 'TV', 'DVD', 'WALKING', 'DEAD.Based', 'hit', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'day', 'zombie', 'outing', 'other', 'most', 'ways', 'True', 'beginning', 'series', 'bit', '28', 'DAY', 'LATER', 'once', 'get', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'zombie', 'tales', 'ever', 'filmed', 'most', ""n't"", 'focus', 'as', 'much', 'zombies', 'survivors.The', 'series', 'officer', 'Rick', 'Grimes', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'being', 'shot', 'put', 'coma', 'When', 'one', 'left', 'floor', 'hospital', 'most', 'rooms', 'floor', 'tossed', 'turned', 'slowly', 'way', 'white', 'corridors', 'chained', 'double', 'door', 'warning', 'what', 'spray', 'painted.Finding', 'clothes', 'setting', 'out', 'locate', 'family', 'Grimes', 'nothing', 'devastation', 'direction', 'Crashed', 'helicopters', 'cars', 'are', 'everywhere', 'sign', 'people', 'hospital', 'are', 'row', 'row', 'sheet', 'covered', 'corpses', 'What', 'happened', 'Grimes', 'trek', 'home', 'up', 'close', 'what', 'happened', 'Though', 'unable', 'believe', 'eyes', 'half', 'rotted', 'corpse', 'grass', 'Grimes', 'bicycle', 'apparently', 'belonged', 'corpse', 'home', 'only', 'be', 'knocked', 'unconscious', 'someone', 'living', 'there.A', 'man', 'son', 'are', 'staying', 'house', 'nearby', 'Grimes', 'old', 'home', 'vacated', 'wife', 'Lori', 'Sarah', 'Wayne', 'Callies', 'son', 'Carl', 'Chandler', 'Riggs', 'what', 'happened', 'most', 'zombie', 'films', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'caused', 'happen', 'Grimes', 'how', 'zombies', 'walk', 'streets', 'attracted', 'noise', 'searching', 'living', 'feed', 'off', 'of.It', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'Grimes', 'man', 'son', 'taking', 'local', 'police', 'station', 'arming', 'heavily', 'as', 'well', 'providing', 'place', 'shower', 'station', 'own', 'emergency', 'energy', 'source', 'giving', 'light', 'hot', 'water', 'Grimes', 'heads', 'towards', 'Atlanta', 'search', 'family', 'sharing', 'walkie', 'talkie', 'man', 'chance', 'later', 'only', 'part', 'story', 'Grimes', 'search', 'see', 'partner', 'Shane', 'Jon', 'Bernthal', 'group', 'survivors', 'banded', 'together', 'group', 'are', 'Grimes', 'wife', 'son', 'Shane', 'Grimes', 'wife', 'are', 'now', 'couple', 'Eventually', 'know', 'paths', 'will', 'meet.The', 'best', 'part', 'show', 'story', 'people', 'struggling', 'survive', 'world', 'gone', 'mad', 'depth', 'show', 'realistic', 'scenarios', 'what', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'how', 'might', 'react', 'giving', 'more', 'human', 'element', 'story', 'rather', 'focusing', 'gore', 'zombies', 'alone', 'tale', 'emotions', 'basic', 'instinct', 'survival', 'tale', 'most', 'zombie', 'movies.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'plenty', 'zombies', 'be', 'seen', 'enough', 'gore', 'keep', 'fans', 'happy', 'KNB', 'effects', 'have', 'done', 'outstanding', 'job', 'here', 'scenes', 'downtown', 'street', 'Atlanta', 'filled', 'zombies', 'moving', 'hero', 'truly', 'make', 'skin', 'crawl.Tested', 'just', 'few', 'show', 'was', 'dynamite', 'hit', 'AMC', 'was', 'quickly', 'renewed', 'second', 'season', 'much', 'longer', 'first', 'season', 'airs', 'fans', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'content', 'DVD', 'release', 'season', 'one', 'Horror', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'must', 'have', 'collection', 'Movie', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'horror', 'film', 'done', 'right', 'just', 'curious', 'will', 'find', 'more', 'bargained', 'horror', 'series', 'Well', 'made', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'style', 'featuring', 'story', 'slowly', 'make', 'one', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'collection']",N/A

1389866,A4RBWH5IMQBXZ,B0049P1VHS,"Michael Andrews ""movie buff""","[0, 1]","Simply put, ""The Walking Dead"" is right now one of the best television dramas of the last several years. I never read Robert Kirkman's original epic comic book series, however, I never read the Harry Potter books or read the Lord of the Rings books either, and yet I loved the film adaptations of those stories to the point I felt I didnt need to. ""The Walking Dead"" is brilliant...AND TERRIFYING!! The fact it's on cable (AMC channel)is wonderful. I like zombie fiction. I'm a huge fan of George Romero's legendary ""Living Dead"" film series...however, this is something completely different!Most zombie films, the best ones anyway, try to give you compelling heroic human characters who struggle to hold things together while the world we know has been destroyed amidst the dead rising up and the brutal carnage reaches a fever pitch. ""Walking Dead"" gives us human characters, who try to always do the heroic thing, yet sometimes the line between heroism and viciousness gets somewhat blurred. I like that. This is a world where everything is upside down, inside out, and even the best intentions can have dire consequences. A ragtag band of survivors, led by Rick (Andrew Lincoln), Shane (Jon Bernthal)and Rick's wife travel through Atlanta trying to seek safe haven from the undead scourge. In the series, the creatures arent referred to as zombies, but as ""Walkers"". According to Kirkman, this is a world in which no one has ever heard of or seen a zombie, even in a fictional setting, and this leads to the series giving us a realistic tone to the undead.Trust me, these ""Walkers"" are gruesome, and vicious, and scary! There are more scares in this series than what we see in most theatrical features nowadays. You never know when the luck of these human survivors will run out, and thats the power of dramatic tension. Right now we're in the middle of its second season (however, its split in half, with the remainder of the season resuming in February next year). I loved the first season, although it was too short with only six episodes. I had to buy the blu ray 3 disc collection; I'm loving this series soooo much. Kudos to Executive Producer Frank Darabont, co-producer Kirkman, make-up effects creator Greg Nicotero, the excellent cast and the writers who know its not always about the ""monsters"", but about the human drama that surrounds it.

I never heard of this series until it was offered through the Amazon Vine program. Out of curiosity I ordered it, thinking I'd watch the first episode or two and formulate a review.Well good thing there are only 8 episodes because otherwise I'd have spent a lot more time watching this instead of doing whatever I should have been doing. Once I started watching it, I couldn't stop because I had to see what was going to happen next.You can get the basic plot details from the other reviews posted here. What I want to say is that I got addicted because of the quality of the plots and the acting - I became immersed in the series and felt like someone who was actually there with this small band of survivors, feeling constantly on edge because of the dangers to which they were exposed and also imagining a world in which something like this actually happened.One thing I want to point out is that it is a very gruesome show - most definitely the scenes of violence and bloodshed are graphic and disturbingly real so if that kind of stuff bothers you, then I'd suggest watching something else. It's a virtual hackfest of blood spraying all over the place and body parts flying in all directions. This is not solely for shock value, though - it is just part of the overall experience of watching this series, and part of what I feel are very intelligently written and believably acted plots.While I am not planning on getting cable television just to watch season 2, I am looking forward to the new season so that they can hurry up and release it on DVD.

While I haven't seen many of the historically important zombie films, I have seen my fair share of the recent entries.  The Walking Dead had the potential to be the best thing on TV, I thought.  Then, unfortunately, the writing turned cliched, or the characters made head-scratching decisions, or so on and so forth.  The first episode is fantastic with Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes, waking up from a coma in a strange world.  The first episode also features Lennie James, no stranger to the post-apocalyptic world on television.  Unfortunately, he isn't a major part of the show but does what he can to elevate it.  After the first episode, it is more hit-or-miss, always leaving you with wanting a little more from it.The zombies themselves are very well-done, and the production values are extremely high.

I watched this on AMC but only saw six episodes and thouhgt this was a good way to catch up on the series.  But it turns out that there was only six episodes!Police officer Rick Grimes is shot an wakes up some time later in a hospital bed.  The only problem is that the hospital is empty.  Rick goes through the hospital in a daze unable to comprehend what he is seeing.  When he leaves, there are pile after pile of dead bodies.  With no one around, Rick heads home only to find it deserted.  His wife and son have vanished.Rick is found by Mogan Jones and his son Duane.  Morgan gives Rick a lesson in Zombie 101.  Morgan tells Rick that people were told to go to Atlanta.  Rick decides to go to Atlanta in hopes of finding his family.  But what Rick does not know is that Atlanta has been overrun by walkers (their term for zombies).Just outside of Atlanta is a group of survivors headed by Rick's partner Shane.As episode one ends.  Rick is stranded in a tank in Atlanta surrounded by walkers.Episode two -  Rick is stranded in a tank but then he hears a voice over the radio.  With the voice's help, he escapes and we meet another part of the survivor group.  The downside of Rick's rescue is that the walkers are alerted to the humans and they become trapped in a department store.  Through some ingenuity, Rick is able to save all but one of the survivors.Episode three - Bad boy Merle is still handcuffed to the roof of the store with the walkers try to break down the door.  Rick and the rest of the department store survivors return to camp.  To Rick's surprise, two of the survivors are his wife and son.  What he doesn't know is that his wife and his partner Shane have hooked up. A rescue mission to save Merle is mounted but all they find is his severed hand.Episode four - Since Merle escaped, now they are trying to get the guns that Rick lost in the street.  But even that goes wrong when they encounter a new group of survivors who have as ecret of their own.  Back at the camp, things are breaking down.

If there's anything zombie that's come out in the past couple of years we've seen it.  So it came as no surprise when one night he's like, we're going out, The Walking Dead is out on video now.  I of course was clueless and suppressed a small groan.  ""Not another zombie movie!"".  Nope, not another movie, this ones a tv series was his answer to me, his eyes lit up with glee.  Surprisingly, I was engrossed from the first episode.SYNOPSIS: (There may be spoilers!)This is a short series; only six episodes long at this time.  But there is a lot packed into those episodes.  We're given a little bit of intro in which we are introduced to Rick Grimes a deputy sheriff in a small town, who is shot in the line of duty despite his partner Shane's best efforts to keep him safe.  When Grimes next wakes up, he is in the hospital and no one is responding to his calls.  His machines are off, and the flowers left are dead.  He stumbles out into a scene of madness with the hospital ripped apart and dead bodies lying everywhere.  Stumbling around in his hospital gown he encounters some things a bit scarier though, as he leaves the hospital the whole area is destroyed and bodies are piled everywhere.  There's one that he sees while taking a bike that looks demolished, but then it starts moving.  Still disoriented from waking up in the hospital after being in that long coma he continues home to see what has happened to his wife Lori and son Carl.Defeated after finding the house empty, he stops to rest and doesn't really pay attention to the strange moving man coming up the street towards him.  But then two more people come on the scene and brutally murder the man in front of him.  Still weak and having been hit by one of them, he passes out only to awaken later being cared for by a man and his son.  They explain what has been going on in the world since he's been in a coma.  They explain all about the Walkers, and how to destroy them.  Later, he leaves and sets out for Atlanta, hoping to find his family and some safe refuge.  Atlanta isn't what he expects though.  Thinking he has met his end he is rescued at the last minute by a foraging group in the city.  They are part of a group camped outside the city and are just trying to survive.  Now, with all odds against them they have to make it out of the city and back to everyone else, but even after that, what are they going to do in a world taken over by the walking dead?CHARACTERS:Andrew Lincoln as Rick GrimesJon Bernthal as Shane WalshSarah Wayne Callies as Lori GrimesLaurie Holden as AndreaJeffrey DeMunn as Dale HorwathSteven Yeun as GlennChandler Riggs as Carl GrimesEmma Bell as AmyViviana Chavez as MirandaNoah Emmerich as Dr. Edwin JennerMadison Lintz as SophiaMaddie Lomax as ElizaNoah Lomax as LouisMelissa McBride as CarolAdam Minarovich as EdJuan Pareja as MoralesJeryl Prescott Sales as JacquiNorman Reedus as Daryl DixonMichael Rooker as Merle DixonAndrew Rothenberg as JimIronE Singleton as T-DogI'd never really seen any of these actors in anything before, but I think they all did a magnificent job.  Fear is prevalent throughout the movie and all were able to express that very well.  Rick as a character was somewhat unbelievable at times and had an uncanny knack for surviving.  But I suppose that's what makes the story.  I think his wife is a raging jerk and very finicky and I'm not fond of her at all.  Everyone else is pretty interesting and its a good mix up to do the story.All the effects were remarkably done.  Everything was very lifelike and the zombies both creeped me out, grossed me out, and amazed me all at the same time.  It was even scary in certain moments.  Some of the imagery was incredible.  The picture shown on the cover of the dvd set is of Rick riding a horse down an empty road into Atlanta.  This is a real scene from the movie and it was very powerful.  Most of them are in fact.  But they are also very brutal.  There is a lot of gore and violence in this movie and it can be stomach turning.  If you can't even handle a little bit of blood, this series is not for you.I can't wait for the second season to come out.

1389898,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B0049P1VHS,mrliteral,"[1, 2]","The Walking Dead is to zombie movies what The Sopranos was to gangster movies:  a chance to expand the genre into something new and more detailed.  Your standard zombie flick pits a few people against an army of zombies and offers plenty of gory violence.  The Walking Dead does the same thing, but has an emphasis on plot and character that most zombie films don't.  This isn't to denigrate the movies, but you can do a lot more with a story if you have five hours (in the first season) than only 90 minutes.The Walking Dead's principal protagonist is deputy Rick Grimes who (in shades of 28 Days Later) wakes up from a gunshot-induced semi-coma to find the world is a much grimmer place.  Most of civilization has fallen due to a zombie epidemic (actually, in the show, ""zombie"" is not used; the preferred term is ""walker"").  Fortunately, they are the ""classic"" slow moving zombies; unfortunately, there are millions of them.The early part of the six-episode season focuses on Grimes's attempts to find his family.  It's not much of a spoiler to indicate his wife and son are alive (it's revealed early on) and eventually he will join them and a group of other survivors.Grimes's role as an authority figure puts him in a leadership position (taking it over from his cop partner, who had the role first).  It is an inherently unstable position since the law doesn't really exist anymore.  For Grimes, there is also the struggle to maintain his natural integrity.  At one point, he will risk his life (and others') to attempt to rescue a nasty drug-addled racist.  Later, he will drive a decision for the group to leave their camp and seek refuge at a different place, a location that will seem safer but also bears a terrible secret.Since you are with these characters for a longer period of time than in a movie, they wind up involving you more, which heightens the suspense.  This is one of the goriest TV series to ever appear on a non-premium channel, but it works in its context.  It won't appeal to a lot of people for this reason, but for those who like zombie stories, this is superb entertainment.",5,Takin' a walk on the dead side,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,2108,"['Walking', 'Dead', 'zombie', 'movies', 'what', 'Sopranos', 'was', 'gangster', 'movies', 'chance', 'expand', 'genre', 'something', 'new', 'more', 'detailed', 'standard', 'zombie', 'flick', 'few', 'people', 'army', 'zombies', 'plenty', 'gory', 'violence', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'same', 'thing', 'emphasis', 'plot', 'character', 'most', 'zombie', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'denigrate', 'movies', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'more', 'story', 'have', 'five', 'hours', 'first', 'season', 'only', '90', 'minutes.The', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'principal', 'protagonist', 'deputy', 'Rick', 'Grimes', 'who', 'shades', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'up', 'gunshot-induced', 'semi-coma', 'find', 'world', 'much', 'grimmer', 'place', 'Most', 'civilization', 'fallen', 'due', 'zombie', 'epidemic', 'actually', 'show', 'zombie', 'not', 'used', 'preferred', 'term', 'walker', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'classic', 'slow', 'moving', 'zombies', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'millions', 'them.The', 'early', 'part', 'six-episode', 'season', 'focuses', 'Grimes', 'attempts', 'find', 'family', 'not', 'much', 'spoiler', 'indicate', 'wife', 'son', 'are', 'alive', 'revealed', 'early', 'eventually', 'will', 'join', 'group', 'other', 'survivors.Grimes', 'role', 'authority', 'figure', 'leadership', 'position', 'taking', 'cop', 'partner', 'who', 'had', 'role', 'first', 'inherently', 'unstable', 'position', 'law', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', 'anymore', 'Grimes', 'also', 'struggle', 'maintain', 'natural', 'integrity', 'one', 'point', 'will', 'risk', 'life', 'others', 'attempt', 'rescue', 'nasty', 'drug-addled', 'racist', 'Later', 'will', 'drive', 'decision', 'group', 'leave', 'camp', 'seek', 'refuge', 'different', 'place', 'location', 'will', 'seem', 'safer', 'also', 'terrible', 'secret.Since', 'are', 'characters', 'longer', 'period', 'time', 'movie', 'wind', 'up', 'involving', 'more', 'suspense', 'one', 'goriest', 'TV', 'series', 'ever', 'appear', 'non-premium', 'channel', 'context', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'lot', 'people', 'reason', 'who', 'like', 'zombie', 'stories', 'superb', 'entertainment']",N/A

A pitch-perfect adaptation of Robert Kirkman's Image Comics series, AMC's The Walking Dead is simply spectacular.  Georgia cop Rick (Andrew Lincoln) wakes up from a coma to find the world around him has gone straight to hell.  Flesh eating zombies are everywhere, but that doesn't stop Rick from searching for his missing wife Lori (Prison Break's Sarah Wayne Callies) and young son Carl (Chandler Riggs).  Unbeknownst to Rick however is that his partner Shane (Jon Bernthal) has things well in hand, with things getting hot and heavy between him and Lori in the process.  Produced by Frank Darabont (director of The Mist, The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile; and who also helms the pilot episode), The Walking Dead captures both the horror and human elements that make Kirkman's comic so good in the first place.  Deviations from the source material aside, this is the brilliant zombie epic we've been waiting years for.  It's scary, rightfully bloody, and features a wonderful cast that also includes Darabont regulars Jeffrey DeMunn and Laurie Holden as Dale and Andrea respectively, newcomer Steven Yuen who is excellent as Glenn, and memorable guest appearances from Norman Reedus, Michael Rooker, and Noah Emmerich.  While this first season's six episodes are based on the comic's first storyarc, things conclude in a very different manner than the comic, and it leaves things sitting on a powder keg for the upcoming second season.  Do yourself a favor, even if you've never checked out the comic, give The Walking Dead a try.

It is one of the best miniseries to come on TV in a while.  There are many detailed reviews on this product, so I will keep my review brief.The story focuses on approximately 15 main characters who are trying to survive after the dead have started coming back to life.  In some ways, it is an affirmative action sampling of the population since all groups are represented. (Which seems a little fake, but in a place like Atlanta it could happen.) The walking dead are zombies in the traditional sense...they want to eat living things and they are killed by destroying the brain.  They're typically referred to as ""walkers"" in this series.The first episode focuses primarily on the hero, Rick Grimes, who is a police officer that wakes up in the hospital after being in a coma.  Gradually, he learns the reality of the apocalyptic world.  A few of the other survivors are introduced to us in Episode 1 as well.The remainder of the episodes deal with a wider group of people and a few ""quests"" to either find someone or rescue someone.  The final episode of Season 1 seemed a little out of place with the previous tone of the movie, but it ended the season with a hard hitting reality check: there is no safety in Atlanta.  Many of the characters do come across as stereotypes, but there will be more seasons for character development.People will enjoy this series if they realize that it focuses on the characters more than blasting zombies.  It's a human interaction story.  Just don't take it too seriously or think too hard about it.  Just enjoy it and remember it was based on comic books.",5,"It's a human drama, not just blasting zombies.",1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,1675,"['Walking', 'Dead', 'adaptation', 'graphic', 'novel', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'one', 'best', 'miniseries', 'come', 'TV', 'while', 'are', 'many', 'detailed', 'reviews', 'product', 'will', 'keep', 'review', 'story', 'focuses', 'approximately', '15', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'survive', 'dead', 'have', 'started', 'coming', 'back', 'life', 'ways', 'affirmative', 'action', 'sampling', 'population', 'groups', 'are', 'represented', 'Which', 'little', 'fake', 'place', 'Atlanta', 'could', 'happen', 'walking', 'dead', 'are', 'zombies', 'traditional', 'sense', 'want', 'eat', 'living', 'things', 'are', 'killed', 'destroying', 'brain', ""'re"", 'typically', 'referred', 'walkers', 'series.The', 'first', 'episode', 'focuses', 'primarily', 'hero', 'Rick', 'Grimes', 'who', 'police', 'officer', 'up', 'hospital', 'being', 'coma', 'Gradually', 'reality', 'apocalyptic', 'world', 'few', 'other', 'survivors', 'are', 'introduced', 'Episode', '1', 'well.The', 'remainder', 'episodes', 'deal', 'wider', 'group', 'people', 'few', 'quests', 'find', 'someone', 'rescue', 'someone', 'final', 'episode', 'Season', '1', 'seemed', 'little', 'place', 'previous', 'tone', 'movie', 'ended', 'season', 'hard', 'hitting', 'reality', 'check', 'safety', 'Atlanta', 'Many', 'characters', 'do', 'come', 'stereotypes', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'seasons', 'character', 'development.People', 'will', 'enjoy', 'series', 'realize', 'characters', 'more', 'blasting', 'zombies', 'human', 'interaction', 'story', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'Just', 'enjoy', 'remember', 'was', 'based', 'comic', 'books']",N/A

However, given the direction that later seasons have taken, it is necessary to discuss later seasons for comparison&#8217;s sake.Season 1 starts off with a scene lifted almost directly from &#8220;28 Days Later&#8221;, with sheriff Rick Grimes waking up from a gunshot induced coma to discover he is in a deserted hospital that looks like it was the site of an apocalyptic nightmare.  Of course, we know that several months earlier a pandemic virus that kills its victims and reanimates them as &#8216;walking dead&#8217; overran the Deep South and, from all indications, the rest of the nation, if not the world.  While Rick was unconscious, his wife (Lori), son (Carl) and best friend (Shane) all were forced to escape the cities with other refugees.  Rick&#8217;s goal is to try to find survivors, with the hope that his wife and son are among them.Based on the wildly popular graphic novel of the same name, and hitting television sets at a time where popular culture&#8217;s interest in zombies was at its zenith, &#8220;The Walking Dead&#8221; had a very auspicious start.  The tension, drama and suspense as Rick joins up with a group of survivors, that includes his family, is palpable.  His determination to find a solution to this crisis by taking a group into Atlanta to the Centers for Disease Control leads to several other compelling encounters with different survivor groups who are persevering in their own way.  The additional drama brought about by Rick&#8217;s unexpected &#8216;resurrection&#8217; creates massive conflicts between Shane and Lori.Season 1 comes to stunning climax when Rick and his group learn that there is no quick solution from the one surviving CDC employee.  The subsequent seasons will be about the long haul survival of these people.One of the biggest disappointments about Season 1 has nothing to do with Season 1.  The problem is that none of the following seasons ever managed to come close to the narrative pace and excitement of these first episodes.  The one dimensional caricatures of the first season were not as big of an issue as the plot continued to rapidly advance.  Unfortunately, as the producers decided to artificially inflate story lines to increase the number of episodes they could run, the failure to engage in any meaningful character development because exacerbated by plot elements that moved slower than molasses in January.However, Season 1 can remain a shining example of how to kick off ambitious show.  It can also remain as a reminder of what the show failed to live up to in later seasons.",5,Spectacular first season that all subsequent seasons have miserably failed to live up to.,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,2656,"['objective', 'keep', 'review', 'just', 'season', '1', '8220', 'Walking', 'Dead', '8221', 'However', 'given', 'direction', 'later', 'seasons', 'have', 'taken', 'necessary', 'discuss', 'later', 'seasons', 'comparison', '8217', '1', 'starts', 'scene', 'lifted', 'almost', 'directly', '8220', '28', 'Days', 'Later', '8221', 'sheriff', 'Rick', 'Grimes', 'waking', 'up', 'gunshot', 'induced', 'coma', 'discover', 'deserted', 'hospital', 'was', 'site', 'apocalyptic', 'nightmare', 'course', 'know', 'several', 'months', 'earlier', 'pandemic', 'virus', 'victims', '8216', 'walking', 'dead', '8217', 'overran', 'Deep', 'South', 'indications', 'rest', 'nation', 'not', 'world', 'Rick', 'was', 'unconscious', 'wife', 'Lori', 'son', 'Carl', 'best', 'friend', 'Shane', 'were', 'forced', 'escape', 'cities', 'other', 'refugees', 'Rick', '8217', 's', 'goal', 'try', 'find', 'survivors', 'hope', 'wife', 'son', 'are', 'them.Based', 'wildly', 'popular', 'graphic', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'hitting', 'television', 'sets', 'time', 'where', 'popular', 'culture', '8217', 's', 'interest', 'zombies', 'was', 'zenith', '8220', 'Walking', 'Dead', '8221', 'had', 'very', 'auspicious', 'start', 'tension', 'drama', 'suspense', 'Rick', 'up', 'group', 'survivors', 'family', 'palpable', 'determination', 'find', 'solution', 'crisis', 'taking', 'group', 'Atlanta', 'Centers', 'Disease', 'Control', 'several', 'other', 'compelling', 'encounters', 'different', 'survivor', 'groups', 'who', 'are', 'persevering', 'own', 'way', 'additional', 'drama', 'brought', 'about', 'Rick', '8217', 'unexpected', '8216', 'resurrection', '8217', 'massive', 'conflicts', 'Shane', 'Lori.Season', '1', 'stunning', 'climax', 'when', 'Rick', 'group', 'learn', 'quick', 'solution', 'one', 'surviving', 'CDC', 'employee', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'haul', 'survival', 'people.One', 'biggest', 'disappointments', 'Season', '1', 'nothing', 'do', 'Season', '1', 'problem', 'none', 'following', 'seasons', 'ever', 'managed', 'come', 'close', 'narrative', 'pace', 'excitement', 'first', 'episodes', 'one', 'dimensional', 'caricatures', 'first', 'season', 'were', 'not', 'big', 'issue', 'plot', 'continued', 'rapidly', 'advance', 'Unfortunately', 'producers', 'decided', 'artificially', 'inflate', 'story', 'lines', 'increase', 'number', 'episodes', 'could', 'run', 'failure', 'engage', 'meaningful', 'character', 'development', 'exacerbated', 'plot', 'elements', 'moved', 'slower', 'molasses', 'January.However', 'Season', '1', 'can', 'remain', 'shining', 'example', 'how', 'kick', 'off', 'ambitious', 'show', 'can', 'also', 'remain', 'reminder', 'what', 'show', 'failed', 'live', 'up', 'later', 'seasons']",N/A

What stood out to me were reasons of poor acting and being very predictable. I have yet to hint any poor acting by the actors and it is not really predictable from where I stand. The acting is quite superb and this is not an understatement; the actors are not the typical soap opera actors on afternoon TV. They each have that little something that evolves into a huge flow of depth expressed in dialogue and emotion. I keep an open mind when I watch each episode to the acting and to say it is a joke, not funny. But to each his own.As to my own review of the first season, it is just spectacular. I am a fan of zombies. I enjoy a movie depicting endless zombies furnished with a small group of survivors trying to overcome their odds to stay alive. This fits the description of The Walking Dead yet not in its entirety. As opposed to many movies in the typical zombie apocalypse plot, this series is very unique in that it heavily makes you think and critique every character and their actions. The relationships between them interacts so vividly I dare to say The Walking Dead is not so much about zombies and blasting them to smithereens with shotguns, revolvers and the all-so silent melee weapons like a baseball bat or sword than it is the love-hate and personal demons circulating about. This field is not explored much by the zombie-genre and it has always been missing until now.Speaking of characters, the love-hate factor is evident right from the beginning. The same feelings will not always be there as you will change due to the fact character development is literally on steroids here. It is almost like a biography of every one packed into a series.In summary, the action is all there just like any other zombie movie you would expect. What clearly makes the series stand out from the rest  is the portrayal of how and what the word humanity means.What does humanity mean?How do you balance between humanity and the will to survive?Is humanity relevant even in this day?Or is humanity obsolete?Humanity has never been more subjective than it is now.I am a late-comer since initially I was not interested about The Walking Dead. I think it is because I do not have cable, believe it or not, nor do I own any other series on DVD. True, I had heard about it before with all the praises. I bought the first and second season just recently out of curiosity [ bored at shows featuring now on regular TV ] and the praises were all true.

As a TV series, other than Friday Night Lights, I've never been so drawn into a world.The main characters have distinct personalities.The men:Rick Grimes - The moral leader.Glenn Rhee - Smart, stealthy, supporter of the team. He's accused of being weak at times but is the opposite.Daryl Dixon - Loner. He's rough around the edges but inside has a good heart. They're in the south, so they needed a hard core redneck.Shane Walsh - Bad ass cop, he's the one who you're never quite sure about. Friend, or foe?Dale Horvath - The group's elder. His words of wisdom are often lost on the younger generation. Isn't that how it usually works?Hershel Greene - Opinionated, but somewhat delusional, he thinks they're dealing with a virus for which a cure will soon be found.The women:Andrea - The strongest, yet at times, weakest, of the women. She contemplates suicide more than once but learns to protect herself.Carol Peletier - The weakest of the women, she lets men abuse her, and seems clingy.Lori Grimes - The unofficial ""First Lady"" of the group. She's at times mother, at other times confidant to the women, at other times supporter of the men.Maggie Greene - Farm girl who falls for Glenn. She lives in Hershel's dream world until reality jolts her.I've read a number of the 2-star reviews (as I never read the 1-star ones) and most of them focus on how ""we've seen this all before"" or the plot is ""contrived"" or ""people just don't act that way."" I'll address each of these cons for folks out there who might be interested but have been turned off by the negativity.SPOILERS AHEADThe beginning. A cop named Rick is shot. He's in a hospital. When he wakes up the world has fallen to chaos. It feels too familiar to 28 Days Later. But that's where the similarity ends. Rick comes across a father and son, who save him and tell him it's safe in Atlanta. That they will soon make their way there. So Rick decides if his wife and son are alive that's probably where they'd be. Atlanta, of course, is overrun. He hides in a tank where apparently the operators were also taken by the virus. Rick is saved by Glenn who watched him crawl in the tank. The group who Glenn is with outside the city happens to be the group whom Rick's wife is with; and she isn't alone. She's been getting down with his best friend Shane, who left him to die in the hospital.Contrived? I'd say, yes, there are some coincidences that seem a bit far out, Rick's reunion with his wife the most egregious. It will depend on your point of view. I think when you start watching, you expect him to find his wife. If you think it shouldn't have happened, you'll think it was contrived, no matter what. Because in that situation it really has to be ""contrived."" This reunion is what drives the rest of Season 1, so if you can't suspend disbelief with regard to it, you will hate this series.Why do they kill themselves out of nowhere? Why? Why? Why? I don't even know what to say to this. Wouldn't you think about it in their situation? This is very real to human nature, in my opinion, and I didn't think characters ""did it out of nowhere."" They were probably all thinking about it at one time or another, only some were actually willing to do it.Guns? Why didn't they have more guns? After all, why wouldn't that have been their first priority? With all the guns in the South surely their would be guns EVERYWHERE, falling from the sky, the naysayers pout. I say in a time of panic, humans shift to the most basic parts of the pyramid for survival. Food, Water, Clothing, Shelter. Guns would certainly be on the list, and these folks admitted they needed more guns, but I could understand how, in a time of panic, that might not have been as much a priority. Also, in the beginning, they didn't necessarily know their would be ""herds"" roaming. They were away from their town and far from the city, so they had a false sense of security.Why do the characters keep doing dumb things? Admittedly, these excursions lead to chaos more often than not, but isn't that why we watch? Don't we watch or read these zombie dramas to see the group attacked? To see how they react to adversity? To watch the breakdown of humanity as we revert to our basic instincts? Rick has a good heart, and he DID grab guns from the station. When he was ambushed he left them in Atlanta. So naturally, his inclination is to retrieve the guns, while doing something good: saving a man he handcuffed to a bar. That is in-line with him as a character: analytical, pragmatic, but not always totally logical. This is in contrast to Shane, who at all the twists and turns believes they should be ruthless. The contrast is clear throughout, never so much as the end of Season 2.END SPOILERSThe bottom line: if you enjoy the zombie genre, great acting, interesting characters, wacky situations, and heart-thumping tension, (and if you have Netflix or AMC on demand), I'd highly recommend throwing on the pilot. This is the type of series where the hook is obvious and if you aren't into it by then, you won't be. If you are like me, you're in for a very, very fun ride, and you won't be able to stop watching once you've started.-Raeden Zen",5,It WIll Draw You In,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,5269,"['watched',

This to me has to be the best of them all. There is more to The Walking Dead than your usual zombie movie. It's not just about the survival of the living, but there is a plot with sub-plots as well. The stories are character driven instead of the usual bloody fanfare. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of blood and gore for those seeking that as well. I won't give any spoilers, so all I am going to say is that if you like a good story no let me correct that, if you like a great story then this is for you.

I am eagerly waiting for season 2 to see how faithful they remain to the comic.Anytime you watch a new series, it takes considerable amount of time for the characters to get into your head to start liking them, this show however, I felt that they acted pretty well to start liking them within few opening scenes.Overall, however, it's definitely an above average show and when you factor in the incredible transfer on DVD material (looks a lot better than it did on AMC TV), The Sound Quality is excellent and so are the spatial separations of the channels which make it more mesmerizing.The Walking Dead:  Season One [Blu-ray] version is even better if you like to shell out few more bucks!This is a must own set for fans of the show like me, and a very reasonable buy if you missed it the first time around on AMC TV.It's a keeper!

The cast were picked very well for their roles and the scenes when they have to play the emotional shots makes it seem like this is really happening to them.

We're introduced to a new characterand FINALLY we might get some info about the lead-up to the presentpredicament the world is in. Jenner is a scientist with the CDC inAtlanta, locked away alone for months with no contact with the outsideworld. He doesn't even know if anyone else is alive as his outersecurity cameras only show corpses piled up all around town. As he'srecording a video diary we get two new nuggets of info: It's been 194days since ""wildfire"" was declared and 63 days since the disease wentinexplicably global.What we don't know is what wildfire is. Could be a mutated vaccine hewas working on, could be a random outbreak from nature, could even bean offshoot from a passing comet. Who knows? But over the last 6.5months the situation has been getting worse, and about 2 months past itbecame apparent no place on earth was safe from it. Which begs a fewquestions, like, is Atlanta Ground Zero for the problem and as you gofarther away the problem is less pronounced? If so, that could be evenworse for people living far from the city as perhaps there was a flashpoint phase where healthy people got sick without being bitten by awalker. Perhaps the disease was airborne first and then altered. (Whichwould go a long way towards explaining why there are so many zombieswalking around. Normally a body decomposes to liquidity within a monthwithout preservatives. Perhaps whatever is causing the walkers toreanimate serves as a preservative too?) Maybe one reason family groupssurvived is because they carry a resistant gene. Again, who knows? Point is, if for some reason this actually happened, these are all rational questions to be asked. I'm surprised this group is so wait-and-see about the end of the world. Obviously this is a little more than FEMA can handle. They've survived this long; now start defining some better parameters for going forward rather than just the nomadic caravan idea. Get to high ground. Find a water supply. Build a fence. These aren't tough ideas to come up with.PS- the old man with the beard and Glenn, the Asian pizza delivery kid,make this series.

I wanted to get that out so it wouldn't get buried. I stream Netflix for $7.99 monthly, and they are hands down the cheapest when it comes to watching shows. Seasons 1 & 2 of the Walking Dead are available. If you want season 3, then you have to stick with Amazon.I am not a fan of zombie shows, but this show is INCREDIBLE. AMC is better than HBO, which I used to love their serials. The Walking Dead is cutting edge, and no one is safe. I think that in itself keeps the show fresh. Things are changing constantly, which as a viewer gives that sense of dread, of doom. There is no feeling of safety for anyone, which is scary. Other TV shows have their cast of characters and no matter what they encounter, you are assured they will make it out alive. You can have empathy, but there is no real mystery. Not so with the Walking Dead. For almost an hour each week, people are put through the paces of ""what if"" and how would I handle things? The characters are in a constant state of survival. There is not time to settle down and grow food. So they have to constantly look for what is left, as more and more has already been plundered. Each week we are made to live the dread with them. We are pushed to change with them, because their personalities are changing week to week as they deal with the nightmare they live in and try to survive.Bravo to the people who took this from a great comic book to an award winning television series (because of this show I began reading the comics.

Also, a guy waking in a hospital after an injury to see the world has changed - ""28 Days Later"" anyone? That said, a slow weekend made me pick up the box set and give it a go. I was wary for the first 45 mins of the pilot, thinking that if it didn't get better soon I'd put the set on eBay and try something else but oh boy did things get better quick!The final 30 mins of the pilot is outstanding, gut busting action as Deputy Grimes enters Atlanta on a horse with a gun slung across his back and a bag of guns behind him only to find the city infested and riddled with zombies. What follows is one of the best chase sequences I've ever seen. Grimes is repeatedly just making it out of reach of the ""walkers"" (as they're known in this series rather than ""zombies"") and he's forced into smaller and smaller spaces, making it out just in time! By the end of the pilot, I was hooked. I had to know how he got out of the way he ends up.From there on in it's a mixture of that tremendous action and the introduction of a motley crew of survivors. Standouts for me were Grimes and his partner (who share an awkward and untold secret) and the belligerent redneck brothers who come to blows more often than not even as they evade the hordes.The series constantly turns conceptions around in the episodes. A group of renegade Latino gangbangers? Think again. A kindly professor offering safe haven? Think again. While a couple of episodes are kind of slow, focusing instead on developing the characters' backgrounds more and including flashbacks to before the world ""turned"", the majority of episodes here are excellent and the zombie action is among the best the genre has produced. You never know who's going to make it and who's going to get bitten and that makes for some great twists and turns along the way as the survivors run from one location to the next, hoping for respite somewhere.The series ends with a literal bang and I was left thinking that it deservedly was given the title of ""best series of 2010"".

Six episodes later I was very tired but very content after watching all of season one.  This is a great series and I can't wait for it to return to television this fall.I had never heard of this series or the graphic novel upon which it is based.  I figured I would try it because I have liked end of the world stories/movies since reading A Canticle for Liebowitz (a 1960 post-apocalyptic novel by Walter Miller) as a young teen. Also, Shawshank Redemption, written and directed by Frank Darabont,  is one of my favorite movies of all time and I was intrigued to see Darabont was the writer and executive producer of The Walking Dead.What got me hooked from the moment I started watching  were the characters. This is not a blood and guts horror movie with stereotypical characters used to take up time between action sequences.  This is a movie where well crafted characters, whose lives have been turned upside down because a virus has destroyed most of civilization, try to survive.The series begins with Rick and Shane, two small town Georgia cops, talking about life and chasing a bad guy.  Rick is shot and wakes up from a coma to find an empty hospital full of bodies.  After realizing he is not dreaming he runs into Morgan and his son who let him know that a virus is killing people and turning them into zombies. The zombies then feed on living things including people.One of the first really moving scenes was Morgan's dilemma over what to do about his wife who has contracted the virus. I won't mention any more for those who have not seen the series.I found all six episodes extremely well written. For someone like me who is not into gore, I found the occasional literal blood and guts scenes (we are talking zombies here) necessary and by no means gratuitous. While I think you could have replaced the zombies with any other threatening creatures, I understand from watching the extras that this is based on  The Walking Dead graphic novel series, which has a big following. Clearly Darabont had great material to work with and from the extras I have learned that he is faithful to the Walking Dead series in many instances. I plan to read this series next.If you like great acting, well crafted characters, exciting action scenes, fascinating character interaction, great dialogue and tons of suspense watch this series.  Plus you get some great zombies thrown in as well. I can't think of a better end of the world/survivor movie.I keep using the word movie, instead of series, because I feel like I watched a movie.  In fact, in one of the extras that came with the series, Darabont explains that AMC told him that they wanted him to create something movie like.  As a result he shot on location when he could and he created this series as if he was creating a movie.The series started with six episodes so that's all you get in season one. There are some good extras talking about how the series came to be and with interviews with cast, crew and Robert Kirkman who wrote the graphic novel.The final episode was great. It ended with me wanting more but I also was pleased that it tied things up sufficiently for me to feel like the six episodes combined had a beginning, middle and end. The characters are still trying to figure out how to survive but I was not left with a cliff hanger, wondering for months until the series resumes, whether some key character was alive or dead.I can't wait for more episodes. I eagerly await season two on DVD.",5,I Could Not Stop Watching this Until I Watched All Six Episodes,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,3581,"['popped', 'disk', 'one', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'dvd', 'player', 'figuring', 'would', 'watch', 'one', 'episode', 'went', 'bed', 'Six', 'later', 'was', 'very', 'tired', 'very', 'content', 'watching', 'season', 'one', 'great', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'return', 'television', 'fall.I', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'series', 'graphic', 'novel', 'based', 'figured', 'would', 'try', 'have', 'liked', 'end', 'world', 'reading', 'A', 'Canticle', 'Liebowitz', '1960', 'post-apocalyptic', 'novel', 'Walter', 'Miller', 'young', 'teen', 'Also', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'written', 'directed', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'was', 'intrigued', 'see', 'Darabont', 'was', 'writer', 'executive', 'producer', 'Walking', 'Dead.What', 'got', 'hooked', 'moment', 'started', 'watching', 'were', 'characters', 'not', 'blood', 'guts', 'horror', 'movie', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'used', 'take', 'up', 'time', 'action', 'sequences', 'movie', 'where', 'well', 'crafted', 'characters', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'virus', 'destroyed', 'most', 'civilization', 'try', 'survive.The', 'series', 'Rick', 'Shane', 'two', 'small', 'town', 'Georgia', 'cops', 'talking', 'life', 'chasing', 'bad', 'guy', 'Rick', 'shot', 'up', 'coma', 'find', 'empty', 'hospital', 'full', 'bodies', 'realizing', 'not', 'dreaming', 'Morgan', 'son', 'who', 'let', 'know', 'virus', 'killing', 'people', 'turning', 'zombies', 'zombies', 'then', 'feed', 'living', 'things', 'including', 'people.One', 'first', 'really', 'moving', 'scenes', 'was', 'Morgan', 'dilemma', 'what', 'do', 'wife', 'who', 'contracted', 'virus', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'more', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'series.I', 'found', 'six', 'episodes', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'gore', 'found', 'occasional', 'literal', 'blood', 'guts', 'scenes', 'are', 'talking', 'zombies', 'here', 'necessary', 'means', 'gratuitous', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'replaced', 'zombies', 'other', 'threatening', 'creatures', 'understand', 'watching', 'extras', 'based', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'graphic', 'novel', 'series', 'big', 'following', 'Clearly', 'Darabont', 'had', 'great', 'material', 'work', 'extras', 'have', 'learned', 'faithful', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'series', 'many', 'instances', 'plan', 'read', 'series', 'like', 'great', 'acting', 'well', 'crafted', 'characters', 'exciting', 'action', 'scenes', 'fascinating', 'character', 'interaction', 'great', 'dialogue', 'tons', 'suspense', 'watch', 'series', 'get', 'great', 'zombies', 'thrown', 'as', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'end', 'world/survivor', 'movie.I', 'keep', 'using', 'word', 'movie', 'instead', 'series', 'feel', 'watched', 'movie', 'fact', 'one', 'extras', 'came', 'series', 'Darabont', 'AMC', 'told', 'wanted', 'create', 'something', 'movie', 'like', 'result', 'shot', 'location', 'when', 'could', 'created', 'series', 'was', 'creating', 'movie.The', 'series', 'started', 'six', 'episodes', 'get', 'season', 'one', 'are', 'good', 'extras', 'talking', 'how', 'series', 'came', 'be', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'Robert', 'Kirkman', 'who', 'wrote', 'graphic', 'novel.The', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'great', 'ended', 'wanting', 'more', 'also', 'was', 'pleased', 'tied', 'things', 'up', 'sufficiently', 'feel', 'six', 'episodes', 'combined', 'had', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'survive', 'was', 'not', 'left', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'wondering', 'months', 'series', 'key', 'character', 'was', 'alive', 'dead.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'more', 'episodes', 'eagerly', 'await', 'season', 'two', 'DVD']",N/A

However, in those zombie movies, they are only able to devote a few moments, out of the 90-120 minutes, to that enthralling subject.In this series they go through a painstaking detail about what it's like to lose your family, dealing with ""dangerous"" survivors, the logic of racism when there is no longer a real race left, sacrificing survivors for the betterment of the others, how to maintain a family and raise children in an apocolypse, figuring out the vulnerabilities and behavior of the zombies, and whether life is really even worth living in such a bleak world.The zombies are pretty much secondary since they just exist to create this stunning landscape to establish a top notch drama.

There's only 6 shows and it's really quick compared to season 2.Yes, I know this is the same old Hero leads a bunch of people out of this Zombie hell of the world story again, but the formula works. I love it! In this show, the formula kind of changes. You get to know the characters more and more, but they will end up died. The zombies will eventually find and kill a character you grown to like/love, and you don't know who is next to die!You might think that in all zombies shows, you know a bunch of people and they will die eventually, but it's different with this show. You don't usually get to know those people that MUCH! You really get the feeling that anyone could get caught by a zombie and get infected and just turn into one at anytime, anywhere.In the story Rick is pretty much the only 1 person, you know for sure, he will not get turned it a zombie. The only reason for that is because he is the MAIN CHARACTER! No, not just a main character, THE MAIN CHARACTER. A main character can still be likely get turned or die in this series.The story follows Rick and what he is doing most of the time. The show also shows other people like Rick wife, son, and best friend and what they are doing. Rick is trying to find his wife and son, but unkonwn to him is where they are. He believes that they are safe and unharmed, but doesn't know where they are. He gets pieces of info from people he meets to where his family might be.The people in this story continue to find themselves never ever being save. Even if they think they are ""safe"", they eventually are not safe and have to keep on moving and finding somewhere safe.I did not wait to watch season 2 after finishing season 1.

I thought it was going to be a little silly and therefore it took a long time for me to come back and decide to give it a shot. I was sorely mistaken, since once I started watching the first episode I was instantly hooked. There is nothing silly about this series, the story is cleverly crafted, there is suspense / horror for days and some of the plot twists will leave you breathless.This is a short first season, so you can go through it in a day, but luckily the following seasons are longer (13 and 16 episodes for seasons 2 and 3 respectively). The creators do a great job with posing questions and slowly giving us information getting us closer and closer to the answer. For example, we instantly start to wonder about what caused the zombie a.k.a. ""walker"" outbreak? Also, what are the exact mechanics by which contagion works? and why walkers have to be killed a certain way.Beside the great story line, there are some excellent performances in this series. I particularly like the job Jon Berthal, who plays an intense Shane, who was a police officer until the outbreak and who after everything changed rebuilt his world only to see things shift again drastically. Jon can communicate quite a bit with his eyes, and this is used quite a bit in the series. Norman Reedus is my other favorite actor in this series, he plays a redneck that has some handy abilities when shooting arrows and may also have a softer side in there somewhere.My advice if you have not given this a try yet is to hurry up and do it already. Don't be like me. Once you start you will be watching these non-stop until you run out of episodes.

Yarbrough""","[2, 3]","I'd never heard of AMC's The Walking Dead and must say I sat down to watch the first season with quite a few preconceived notions after reading ""zombie epidemic"" on the back of the box. It begins with police officer Rick Grimes waking up all alone in an abandoned hospital surrounded by dead bodies and evidence of end-of-the-world chaos that happened while he was in a coma.  I immediately recalled the movie ""28 Days Later"" which opened in much the same way.What continues to make this concept work is having the viewer connect with one central character and we know just as much as he does, or just as little.  The elements of what have happened and what led up to this are completely void.It's the ""not knowing"" that kept me intrigued and kept me watching. Unfortunately, very little of what actually happened is revealed in the first season.  We get hints in conversation as to how the military lost control or how long its been since it all started, but that's about it.We also begin a little heavy on the gore side as Grimes encounters ""the walkers"" while leaving the hospital and trying to get back home to see if his family is still there.  The only way to kill them is with a gunshot blast or hard blow to the head, and you get to see quite a bit of this up close.Grimes is assisted by a man and his son who tell him he needs to go toward Atlanta where an encampment has been set up. Here, Grimes discovers Atlanta is lost to the dead and he actually joins forces with a group who are surviving on the outskirts of town.  It is here that different obstacles, scenarios, and relationships are developed and played out which really gave the series depth.At times, the show felt like the ""reality"" Discovery Channel show called ""The Colony.""  Another great series about a group of people trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. The Walking Dead really starts to get you interested in the characters themselves and their personal struggles, and you almost forget about the zombies that are walking about.Then, an attack happens or gunfire goes off and you find yourself just as startled as the characters themselves as they flee their camp and head toward the CDC for assistance.Directed by Frank Darabont, who also directed ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" it's very easy to see why this story becomes more about the characters and their survival and less about why this is happening or the flesh eating zombies that are walking about.  In the very beginning, Grimes even shows compassion toward a horribly wounded zombie.  He seeks her out and apologizes for what has happened to her before putting her out of her misery. By the end, the viewer has also taken a journey to many places including compassion, loss, sorry, love, and redemption right along with the cast.  But there are still questions that are left unanswered. Lots of them.  And that's definitely enough to keep watching when the second season debuts this Fall.",4,The Walking Dead - Not Just Another Zombie Flick,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,2936,"[""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'AMC', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'must', 'say', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'few', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'reading', 'zombie', 'epidemic', 'back', 'box', 'police', 'officer', 'Rick', 'Grimes', 'waking', 'up', 'alone', 'abandoned', 'hospital', 'surrounded', 'dead', 'bodies', 'evidence', 'end-of-the-world', 'chaos', 'happened', 'was', 'coma', 'immediately', 'recalled', 'movie', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'opened', 'much', 'same', 'make', 'concept', 'work', 'having', 'viewer', 'connect', 'one', 'central', 'character', 'know', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'just', 'little', 'elements', 'what', 'have', 'happened', 'led', 'up', 'are', 'completely', 'void.It', 'not', 'knowing', 'kept', 'intrigued', 'kept', 'watching', 'Unfortunately', 'very', 'little', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'revealed', 'first', 'season', 'get', 'hints', 'conversation', 'how', 'military', 'lost', 'control', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'started', 'it.We', 'also', 'begin', 'little', 'heavy', 'gore', 'side', 'Grimes', 'walkers', 'leaving', 'hospital', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'see', 'family', 'still', 'there', 'only', 'way', 'kill', 'gunshot', 'blast', 'hard', 'blow', 'head', 'get', 'see', 'quite', 'bit', 'up', 'close.Grimes', 'assisted', 'man', 'son', 'who', 'tell', 'go', 'Atlanta', 'where', 'encampment', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'Here', 'Grimes', 'Atlanta', 'lost', 'dead', 'actually', 'forces', 'group', 'who', 'are', 'surviving', 'outskirts', 'town', 'here', 'different', 'obstacles', 'scenarios', 'relationships', 'are', 'developed', 'played', 'out', 'really', 'gave', 'series', 'depth.At', 'times', 'show', 'felt', 'reality', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'show', 'called', 'Colony', 'great', 'series', 'group', 'people', 'trying', 'survive', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'really', 'get', 'interested', 'characters', 'personal', 'struggles', 'almost', 'forget', 'zombies', 'are', 'walking', 'about.Then', 'attack', 'gunfire', 'off', 'find', 'just', 'as', 'startled', 'characters', 'flee', 'camp', 'head', 'CDC', 'assistance.Directed', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'very', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'story', 'more', 'characters', 'survival', 'less', 'about', 'why', 'happening', 'flesh', 'eating', 'zombies', 'are', 'walking', 'about', 'very', 'beginning', 'Grimes', 'even', 'compassion', 'horribly', 'wounded', 'zombie', 'out', 'apologizes', 'what', 'happened', 'putting', 'out', 'misery', 'end', 'viewer', 'also', 'taken', 'journey', 'many', 'places', 'including', 'compassion', 'loss', 'sorry', 'love', 'redemption', 'right', 'along', 'cast', 'are', 'still', 'questions', 'are', 'left', 'unanswered', 'Lots', 'definitely', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'when', 'second', 'season', 'Fall']",N/A

Late fans to the story can now pick up the first 48 issues of the graphic novel in a convenient single work titledThe Walking Dead: Compendium One. As of today, Kirkman has published 80 issues in the series (that I now anxiously check my mailbox for every month).What's all that mean? It means that there are years and years of seasons ahead if this AMC TV series stays the course of excellence that it has so far done in the first season. And I think AMC must be quite pleased with how the show is shaping up because prior to the launch of the first season of only 6 episodes they renewed a second season of 13 episodes that will begin filming in early 2011.Director/Executive Producer Frank Darabont with Kirkman oversight have brought The Dead to life in surprisingly fabulous adaptation of the graphic novel series. Why surprisingly? Because it is a rare occasion that a film or TV adaptation is as good as and so true to the source material. Has the TV series already taken some liberties? Sure. But are those liberties just as well told as Kirkman originally laid out? So far so good. Actually, so far: excellent! This just could be the best new show on TV.The Walking Dead begins the story of Police Officer Rick Grimes as he wakes up from a coma after being shot months ago in a normal world. And ironically his waking throws him into a nightmare of a land that has been devastated by an apocalypse of The Dead. The beginning of the story starts kind of the way the filmResident Evilended and the way28 Days Laterbegan...with the lead character waking up from a coma in a world gone mad.Family gone. Friends gone. Civilization...all gone. Officer Grimes ventures out to find only a handful of survivors at a time. The entire world seemingly has been overrun by vicious hordes of the undead. But as the story matures, it is much less about zombies and more about what happens to society, its morals, laws and standards when government is lost and the planet becomes mostly uninhabitable. There's real, heartfelt emotion in The Walking Dead series combined with believable scenarios.You'll find unfathomable chaos and horror in The Walking Dead as well as a hypothetical look at human nature in a new world: hordes of zombies, along with human survivors in desperate situations that do the unthinkable to stay alive (or entertained).The Walking Dead is a compelling, thought provoking drama that will have you screaming for more after this short 6 episode season ends. But the good news is you can cheat and start reading the graphic novels if you want to catch up or get ahead.Like I said earlier.

1390000,AMGGZCWY3VNZC,B0049P1VHS,S. Morales,"[1, 1]","The Walking Dead is based on a best-selling comic book, and the first of its kind to hit basic cable television. Never before has anyone pushed the envelope to actually incorporate the intensity of zombie apocolypse violence on cable tv, as the idea of zombies has always been left to full-length motion picture filmmakers. This only pushes the character of the zombie to further affix itself to modern culture hopefully as much as the vampire has. Usually many television shows can easily bring vampires to public audiences, and even to Disney channel ones, only because the violence factor of vampires has always been relatively mild. Anyone doing anything with zombies though, would need to amp up the violence/gore factor, which is perhaps why no one has dared to do it; until of course, The Walking Dead.This is a fairly short season, consisting of only 6 episodes, and that is a good thing, considering that a season running about 15 to 20 would be way too much. Regular dramas can do this only because the meat of the show itself, killing zombies, would become way too old if overdone. This season feels more like an introduction to the zombies and our characters more than anything else. With that, we have the typical zombie storyline - world becomes overrun at the offset, one protagonist must find his missing family, we meet others along the way, people fight, split, separate, etc. If you have been watching zombie films since George Romero's classic ""Night of the Living Dead,"" this storyline will not be anything new. What we do look forward to is the characters, their likability, the special effects, etc.Now, while TWD works, it doesn't revolutionlize anything. The zombies are the star of the show here really, no really our characters. Zombies are made up of a mix of CGI and make-up, making the characters themselves very real, but lots of their guts and gore mostly all computer generated. It is noticeable, and a bit disappointingly so, as I still cannot fathom how even after all these years of CGI we still cannot make splashing and squirting blood real looking enough. Anyway, while the gunplay isn't to the point of a video game splatterfest (although THAT is a full-on action episode I would LOVE to see... even though it would only work for ONE episode, after which it would just get old), it still is heavy enough where a good number of our characters die in some pretty gory ways. I myself was a bit shocked to see such gore could even be shown on television, which is good considering this show really is doing something new. This is definitely for mature audiences, and I wouldn't recommend any children under the age of 17 to be exposed to it (15 if they can take it).Still, even though our zombies make a good show, our characters and their plots are simply PRETTY good to OK. They all play their parts well, but nobody really GRABS us, makes us jawdrop or wows us in any way. They are just basically people trying to survive, and admist some standard dialogue, mixed with a flair of cheesy writing, we never really are found rooting for our survivors. I must say though that the writers do geniunely try, they just haven't really found that magic as of yet; maybe they will 2nd season.By the end we sort of end up where we start. I won't give anything away but we are left at the end of the season with simply a good INTRODUCTION to our show, not really much else (really just ONE thing we know will lead to a plot twist in season 2, but just one).Yet this is a good show, I have to give them credit for their guts (in more ways than one), and one zombie fans will enjoy and take pride in. I'm just hoping for more plot twists and character development as the seasons go on, as this season does it very minimally. As far as a decent drama, it's there, and you can't beat the gore, you really can't. 4 stars really for a progressive idea, ambitious storytelling and action.As far as extras, it's your pretty standard fare, which isn't bad: interviews with the director, cast and creators, behind the scenes footage of make-up, etc, a run down of each episodes behind the scenes features.If you want a bigger content of extras I would recommend buying the 3-disc special edition, featuring lots of featurettes about zombies themselves.

It's all good -- for those of us who love zombie movies, good old soap opera drama, and sci-fi.The ""high concept"" here is the mix of different genres. The zombie genre has evolved to often include some reference into sci-fi -- the question, ""Okay, I understand the dead are now walking around eating people -- but, uh, WHY are they doing that, exactly?"" (The answer, of course, is always something like ""Dr. X mixed the Reanimator serum with the Godzilla Virus, and now it's gone airborne!"")Oh. That explains it.The weirdo bogus science aside, this series delivers with atmosphere -- the large-scale scenes of deserted streets are more chilling than the scenes of seemingly endless wrecked cars. The gore is not excessive, but it's definitely there -- even if there wasn't a ""need"" to satisfy gore fans, it's still a realistic part of the plot: dead people walking around, looking to kill living people - something bad WILL happen.Toss in the tear-jerkers, the messy relationship, and some characters that we can almost but not quite care about, and it's a wrap! It works as a basic thrill flick with some poignant scenes here and there -- it has a bit of trouble (doesn't every movie and TV series?) at times, having an especially bumpy ride due to the lack of any message or central thematic note.But it gets there.

Shaun of the Dead, that hilarious loving tribute to zombie movies and George Romero, got me interested. So did the brilliant 28 Days Later. So, from there, I watched Romero's newer stuff. Then his older stuff. And then I got hooked. Now I'm in to the zombie book genre. I'm a sociologist, so the zombie genre fascinates me because it's as much about the people and the collapse of society as it is about the zombies. You could argue that the zombies are just a backdrop for the human drama. So, I was really excited about The Walking Dead. I love zombie movies, but I was intrigued by the prospect of a TV series, in which the filmmakers have time to explore classic zombie genre issues and ideas more thoroughly.I wasn't disappointed. It's a solid show. At times it felt a bit clich&eacute;d, and some of the subplots felt unnecessary or implausible. But the acting is generally strong, the effects are great, and I'm looking forward to the second season. For folks that want a wall-to-wall gorefest, it might be a bit disappointing. Some episodes are almost zombie-free. This show is really about the people. But that's ultimately a strength, and again providing evidence for my theory that the best zombie stories just use zombies as a backdrop for exploring what it means to be a human living among other humans.",4,"A highly satisfying zombie TV series, even with its flaws",1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,1436,"[""'ve"", 'generally', 'never', 'considered', 'be', 'fan', 'horror', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'zombie', 'genre', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'hilarious', 'loving', 'tribute', 'zombie', 'movies', 'George', 'Romero', 'got', 'interested', 'So', 'did', 'brilliant', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'So', 'there', 'watched', 'Romero', 'newer', 'stuff', 'Then', 'older', 'stuff', 'then', 'got', 'hooked', 'Now', ""'m"", 'zombie', 'book', 'genre', ""'m"", 'sociologist', 'zombie', 'genre', 'as', 'much', 'people', 'collapse', 'society', 'zombies', 'could', 'argue', 'zombies', 'are', 'just', 'backdrop', 'human', 'drama', 'So', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'love', 'zombie', 'movies', 'was', 'intrigued', 'prospect', 'TV', 'series', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'time', 'explore', 'classic', 'zombie', 'genre', 'issues', 'ideas', 'more', 'thoroughly.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'solid', 'show', 'times', 'felt', 'bit', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'subplots', 'felt', 'unnecessary', 'implausible', 'acting', 'generally', 'strong', 'effects', 'are', 'great', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'second', 'season', 'folks', 'want', 'wall-to-wall', 'gorefest', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'episodes', 'are', 'almost', 'zombie-free', 'show', 'really', 'people', 'ultimately', 'strength', 'again', 'providing', 'evidence', 'theory', 'best', 'zombie', 'stories', 'just', 'use', 'zombies', 'backdrop', 'exploring', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'living', 'other', 'humans']",N/A
1390010,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B0049P1VHS,Stephen M. Lerch,"[0, 0]","T obe clear, this is a review ofThe Walking Dead:  Season One [Blu-ray]. This includes, but is not limited to the series itself but also the actual technical aspects of the Blu Ray release.The Walking Dead is a small screen adaptation of an ongoing comic book series by the same name. You can find the first part of the series collected inThe Walking Dead:  Compendium One.The story goes that a sheriff's deputy is taken to the hospital after being shot by criminals. When he awakens quite some time seems to have passed and the hospital is empty... with the exception of some dead people and a door with a very odd warning. The series involves Rick trying to reunite with his wife and son while avoiding being bitten by the walking dead. Eventually he hooks up with other survivors, getting ever closer to just what is going on.From what I understand, the TV series takes some liberties with the original comic books story, but tries to remain as true as possible to the source. I have not read the books, so I cannot accurately tell you whether this is fact or not. I'm sure there is at least one website that will compare the two in detail.From a Blu Ray perspective, I have to say that AMC, through Anchor Bay, has really put together a fantastic looking, and sounding collection for this first season.Video-Filmed in 1080p at 24 frames per second, the Blu Ray is encoded at the same resolution and frame rate using the AVC codec. Some scenes contain a bit of grain, usually outdoors shots and I believe this would be as intended by the director and producers. Since I believe this series was done with digital video cameras and equipment, the image is vivid, bright and full of detail. Finally seeing this in 1080p, when the TV airing was at 720p, you can really see more detail.Audio-The Blu Ray is encoded using Dolby Digital TrueHD. Compared to watching this on TV, in standard stereo, it's a subtle but noticeable difference. The higher quality also lets you hear details either missing or stifled by the TV format such as cicadas or crickets when Rick first exits the hospital that were barely audible on TV.Directionality is good, but as the series was filmed specifically for TV, and not everyone has their TV setup in a surround sound situation, there really isn't a ton going on in the rear sound stage. Dialog is front and center and nothing of any importance to the plot is heard strictly in the rear channels. Gunshots, zombie shuffling and other sound effects are all that happens in the rears. This is expected but slightly disappointing none the less.Packaging-Two discs with distinct artwork on each. The Blu Ray case has a slip cover, which is nice but unnecessary. Typical blu case with the two discs on either side of the open case. An insert in the case has the same artwork as the cover and on the flip side has a handy sheet for how to figure out if someone is a walker.Extras-Making of the series, inside the series, sneak preview for season 2, make-up tips and convention footage where the show was debuted if memory serves.Also included is some bonus footage, which is nice but nothing amazing.Over all, there is nothing truly amazing about the extras but they are good enough to watch at least once.If you are a fan of horror movies and zombies, you'll probably enjoy this one. The only issue I can see for someone who is coming to the series for blood and guts and horror, you're likely to be disappointed. I would say The Walking Dead is more a narrative about a man looking for and protecting his family, and the zombies are simply a plot vehicle to get you there. That's not totally true, but fits the series.This is a great release for a great series. 5 stars without question and I hope they offer similar quality when season 2 is released on Blu Ray.",5,Great release for a great series,1300060800,"03 14, 2011",2011,3788,"['T', 'obe', 'clear', 'review', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'Season', 'One', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'not', 'limited', 'series', 'also', 'actual', 'technical', 'aspects', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release.The', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'small', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'ongoing', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'can', 'find', 'first', 'part', 'series', 'collected', 'inThe', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'Compendium', 'One.The', 'story', 'sheriff', 'deputy', 'taken', 'hospital', 'being', 'shot', 'criminals', 'When', 'quite', 'time', 'have', 'passed', 'hospital', 'empty', 'exception', 'dead', 'people', 'door', 'very', 'odd', 'warning', 'series', 'Rick', 'trying', 'reunite', 'wife', 'son', 'avoiding', 'being', 'bitten', 'walking', 'dead', 'Eventually', 'up', 'other', 'survivors', 'getting', 'ever', 'closer', 'just', 'what', 'going', 'what', 'understand', 'TV', 'series', 'liberties', 'original', 'comic', 'books', 'story', 'remain', 'as', 'true', 'possible', 'source', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'can', 'not', 'accurately', 'tell', 'fact', 'not', ""'m"", 'sure', 'least', 'one', 'website', 'will', 'compare', 'two', 'detail.From', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'perspective', 'have', 'say', 'AMC', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'really', 'put', 'together', 'fantastic', 'looking', 'sounding', 'collection', 'first', 'season.Video-Filmed', '1080p', '24', 'frames', 'second', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'encoded', 'same', 'resolution', 'frame', 'rate', 'using', 'AVC', 'codec', 'scenes', 'contain', 'bit', 'grain', 'usually', 'outdoors', 'shots', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'intended', 'director', 'producers', 'believe', 'series', 'was', 'done', 'digital', 'video', 'cameras', 'equipment', 'image', 'vivid', 'bright', 'full', 'detail', 'Finally', 'seeing', '1080p', 'when', 'TV', 'airing', 'was', '720p', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'more', 'detail.Audio-The', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'encoded', 'using', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'TrueHD', 'Compared', 'watching', 'TV', 'standard', 'stereo', 'subtle', 'noticeable', 'difference', 'higher', 'quality', 'also', 'hear', 'details', 'missing', 'stifled', 'TV', 'format', 'such', 'cicadas', 'crickets', 'when', 'Rick', 'first', 'hospital', 'were', 'barely', 'audible', 'TV.Directionality', 'good', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'specifically', 'TV', 'not', 'everyone', 'TV', 'setup', 'surround', 'sound', 'situation', 'really', ""n't"", 'ton', 'going', 'rear', 'sound', 'stage', 'Dialog', 'front', 'center', 'nothing', 'importance', 'plot', 'heard', 'strictly', 'rear', 'channels', 'Gunshots', 'zombie', 'shuffling', 'other', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'rears', 'expected', 'slightly', 'disappointing', 'none', 'less.Packaging-Two', 'discs', 'distinct', 'artwork', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'case', 'slip', 'cover', 'nice', 'unnecessary', 'Typical', 'blu', 'case', 'two', 'discs', 'side', 'open', 'case', 'insert', 'case', 'same', 'artwork', 'cover', 'flip', 'side', 'handy', 'sheet', 'how', 'figure', 'out', 'someone', 'walker.Extras-Making', 'series', 'series', 'sneak', 'preview', 'season', '2', 'make-up', 'tips', 'convention', 'footage', 'where', 'show', 'was', 'debuted', 'memory', 'serves.Also', 'included', 'bonus', 'footage', 'nice', 'nothing', 'amazing.Over', 'nothing', 'truly', 'amazing', 'extras', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'watch', 'least', 'are', 'fan', 'horror', 'movies', 'zombies', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one', 'only', 'issue', 'can', 'see', 'someone', 'who', 'coming', 'series', 'blood', 'guts', 'horror', ""'re"", 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'would', 'say', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'more', 'narrative', 'man', 'looking', 'protecting', 'family', 'zombies', 'are', 'simply', 'plot', 'vehicle', 'get', 'there', 'not', 'totally', 'true', 'series.This', 'great', 'release', 'great', 'series', '5', 'stars', 'question', 'hope', 'offer', 'similar', 'quality', 'when', 'season', '2', 'released', 'Blu', 'Ray']",N/A

That doesn't mean I don't occasionally get lured over to that territory through popular culture or a particularly irresistible bit of story-telling.  I have no cable television in my home, but even I'd heard enough buzz on The Walking Dead to be intrigued.  After all, it's the same network that brought us Mad Men, and I've been hooked on those DVDs for years.  Still, as scary as 60's-era advertising execs are, I wasn't sure I was prepared for zombies.  I called my buddy Jimbo and asked, ""Will The Walking Dead be too scary for me?""  His answer: ""Yes.  But you have to watch it anyway for the story-telling.""  As usual, Jimbo was right on both counts.In the extended pilot episode, a Georgia sheriff's deputy is shot in the line of duty.  He eventually awakens, scruffily bearded, in the hospital after an unknown period of time.  He is still weak, bandaged, and disoriented.  Is he really awake at all?  Because he's awoken alone in a nightmare world.  The hospital is deserted, and there are terrifying signs of violence everywhere.  The morgue has been locked down tight, but there are... things behind the door.  Outside, he finds dozens of decaying bodies lined up like logs.  So begins Rick Grimes' odyssey in a wholly changed world.  Eventually he meets other survivors who explain that the dead have risen and who give Rick the basic info on this brave new world.  His only immediate goal is to survive and find his wife and son.Enough can not be said about the quality of this television series.  From performances, design, special effects and makeup, writing, and direction, this series on the small screen rivals anything you'd see on the big screen.  I don't believe I've ever seen the horror genre treated with such respect and intelligence.  The Walking Dead won't appeal to a universal audience, but there is simply no denying how good it is.The first season DVDs contain a mere six episodes, but they include a nice variety of DVD extras ranging from several making of-style documentaries to a how to achieve zombie makeup tutorial for Halloween.  I was disappointed by the lack of commentary tracks, but hopefully they'll be included next season.Yes, Jimbo was right.  This show is way too scary for me.  I watched these episodes one at a time, with the lights on, and not before bed.  They truly scared me to the point that I could barely continue watching them.  I was cursing Jimbo the whole time and swore that I would not be watching season two.  But by the time episodes five and six were viewed, I knew it was hopeless.  I'm hooked.

It follows Rick Grimes, a small town deputy sheriff who comes out of a coma and wanders into the Zombie Apocalypse.  Rick must find his wife and son while coming to terms with the end of the world as he knows it. The story asks the questions that a standard film lacks the time to address: What if these characters had to survive in this horrific situation forever? How would they survive? Where would they live? How would they get food? What would become of their humanity?  ""The Walking Dead"" is an excellent job portrayal of the human mind under extreme stress.  The prolonged storytelling forces the viewer to form stronger attachments to the characters than one would normally develop for your standard zombie lunch special.""The Walking Dead"" also looks fantastic.  It's filmed as if it was a theatrical motion picture, so it looks awesome, and the writing is superb, too.  The result is a terrifying, heartbreaking, and thrilling experience. Watch out for the last episode on the disc. No spoilers here, but it's a MAJOR departure from the comic series, and it might throw some die-hard fans off.The DVD: The disc and its menus are fairly standard.  An animated title screen shows off your options, with a second disk for Special Features.  All pretty standard, with English and Spanish subtitles. It's really nothing out of the ordinary, so that annoying little DVD standard is here too: advertisements.  In addition to the regular previews and ads preceding the menu, the second disc has an obnoxious surprise.  When I selected the ""Special Features"" menu, I had to click through a ""New Season Coming This Fall"" advert screen before moving on to the bonus content. Thanks.  I'm already watching the show. I have the DVD. I don't think I need to see an advertisement for the show I'm watching RIGHT NOW.  I can't wait to see this ad again in a few years, when it's outdated, and nonsensical.Special Features: This collection has ten featurettes: one for each episode, a general ""making of"", make up behind the scenes, sneak peek with the comic author, and a convention panel. The TV trailer and six ""Extra Footage"" segments, which showcase the creative influences on the show, actor interviews, and so on, are also included.  Although it seems like much of this was previously aired on AMC, it's still a great collection of content for the hungry zombie fan, with enough peeks at the production process to satisfy your inner film nerd.Overall, it's a great DVD - completely worth owning for any fan of the series - but I had to deduct one star out of five for the sake of that stupid, stupid in-menu advertisement.",4,"The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season DVD has everything a TV collection ought to have, with only a few clich&eacute; DVD  flaws",1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,2927,"['Walking', 'Dead', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'DVD', 'everything', 'TV', 'collection', 'ought', 'have', 'only', 'few', 'clich', 'eacute', 'DVD', 'holding', 'back.The', 'Show', 'AMC', 'adaptation', 'Robert', ""Kirkman'sThe"", 'Walking', 'Deadcomic', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'original', 'series', 'being', 'strictly', 'faithful', 'Rick', 'Grimes', 'small', 'town', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'who', 'coma', 'wanders', 'Zombie', 'Apocalypse', 'Rick', 'must', 'find', 'wife', 'son', 'coming', 'terms', 'end', 'world', 'story', 'questions', 'standard', 'film', 'time', 'address', 'What', 'characters', 'had', 'survive', 'horrific', 'situation', 'forever', 'How', 'would', 'survive', 'Where', 'would', 'live', 'How', 'would', 'get', 'food', 'What', 'would', 'become', 'humanity', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'excellent', 'job', 'portrayal', 'human', 'mind', 'extreme', 'stress', 'prolonged', 'storytelling', 'forces', 'viewer', 'form', 'stronger', 'attachments', 'characters', 'one', 'would', 'normally', 'develop', 'standard', 'zombie', 'lunch', 'special', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'also', 'fantastic', 'filmed', 'was', 'theatrical', 'motion', 'picture', 'awesome', 'writing', 'superb', 'too', 'result', 'terrifying', 'heartbreaking', 'thrilling', 'experience', 'Watch', 'out', 'last', 'episode', 'disc', 'spoilers', 'here', 'MAJOR', 'departure', 'comic', 'series', 'might', 'throw', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'off.The', 'DVD', 'disc', 'menus', 'are', 'fairly', 'standard', 'animated', 'title', 'screen', 'options', 'second', 'disk', 'Special', 'Features', 'pretty', 'standard', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'really', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'annoying', 'little', 'DVD', 'standard', 'here', 'too', 'advertisements', 'addition', 'regular', 'previews', 'ads', 'preceding', 'menu', 'second', 'disc', 'obnoxious', 'surprise', 'When', 'selected', 'Special', 'Features', 'menu', 'had', 'click', 'New', 'Season', 'Coming', 'Fall', 'advert', 'screen', 'moving', 'bonus', 'content', 'Thanks', ""'m"", 'already', 'watching', 'show', 'have', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'see', 'advertisement', 'show', ""'m"", 'watching', 'RIGHT', 'NOW', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'ad', 'again', 'few', 'years', 'when', 'outdated', 'nonsensical.Special', 'Features', 'collection', 'ten', 'featurettes', 'one', 'episode', 'general', 'making', 'make', 'up', 'scenes', 'sneak', 'peek', 'comic', 'author', 'convention', 'panel', 'TV', 'trailer', 'six', 'Extra', 'Footage', 'segments', 'showcase', 'creative', 'influences', 'show', 'actor', 'interviews', 'so', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'much', 'was', 'previously', 'aired', 'AMC', 'still', 'great', 'collection', 'content', 'hungry', 'zombie', 'fan', 'enough', 'peeks', 'production', 'process', 'satisfy', 'inner', 'film', 'nerd.Overall', 'great', 'DVD', 'completely', 'owning', 'fan', 'series', 'had', 'deduct', 'one', 'star', 'five', 'sake', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'in-menu', 'advertisement']",N/A

1390026,A19YOYY7FLQMA6,B0049P1VHS,"Tante Maren ""Maren""","[1, 1]","AMC's The Walking Dead has every element that makes for a great new show. Based loosely on Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead Books, this series takes you on it's own storyline with many different twists and turns. The direction is perfection with Shawshank Redemption's Frank Darabont sitting in the director's chair. Added to this talent is Gale Anne Hurd, who produced Aliens and The Terminator. The cast completes this award winning line up of writing, directing and producing, with Andrew Lincoln playing the main character, law officer Rick Grimes, his partner and best friend Shane Walsh played by Jon Bernthal, his wife Lori Grimes played by Sarah Wayne Callies, along with a great supporting cast.Great performances by some of the supporting cast includes Morgan Jones played by Lenny James, Glenn played by Steven Yeun- a huge fan of The Walking Dead Books, Sisters Andrea played by Laurie Holden and Amy played by Emma Bell, Brothers Merle Dixon played by Michael Rooker and Daryl Dixon played by Norman Reedus and Dale played by Jeffrey Demunn. The characters make this show believable by contrasting their human flaws, courage and fears against the non emotional zombies.The story begins with two law officers Rick Grimes and Shane Walsh going through their typical day in a town just outside of Atlanta. While stopping a car of gun toting thugs, Rick, the main character gets shot and after being in the hospital for weeks awakens to a nightmare world of the living dead- zombies. He's totally alone and has no idea where to begin to find out what's happened and where his family is. Following Rick through this challenging new world of zombie gore and the emotional torment he has of the people he may never see again, along with the few non zombie people he meets along the way makes for a great storyline that keeps you watching. I was quite surprised that this main All-American John Wayne type character Rick Grimes is in real life British. Andrew Lincoln does a tremendous job in playing law officer Rick Grimes.There are only 6 Episodes in this first season of The Walking Dead:1. Days Gone Bye2. Guts3. Tell It to the Frogs4. Vatos5. Wildfire6.

1390034,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B0049P1VHS,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[2, 7]","""The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season""  is probably one of the most ambitious horror series made specifically for television.  The notion of cannibalistic zombies roaming mindlessly with only one instinct -- to eat the living -- seems way beyond taboo for the small screen.  But AMC took it on and the show premiered, appropriately, on Halloween night, 2010.County Sheriff Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) awakens from a coma utterly alone in a post-apocalyptic zombie world.  The world he knows is gone.  The series, based on Robert Kirkman's successful, popular comic book series, tells the story of the weeks and months that follow the apocalypse.  All six episodes are contained in this two-disc set.On the plus side, ""The Walking Dead"" is graphic and doesn't cut away from the more gruesome scenes.  Fans of zombie flicks will appreciate that.  Special effects are outstanding, from the zombies' ghastly make-up to sequences in which the zombies feast on their victims.  The acting, overall, is good, particularly from Andrew Lincoln as the sheriff, Jon Bernthal as Deputy Shane Walsh, and Jeffrey DeMunn as retired widower Dale.The downside is that, after the first episode, there are long stretches of talk, talk, talk, with little zombie footage.  We get a lot of background on the eight main characters, maybe more than we really care about.  It's the zombies that are the primary attraction.  When they do appear, they're creepy, scary, and make for exciting moments.Bonus features are generous.  In addition to a making-of featurette, there is a behind-the-scenes look at the zombie make-up, ""A Sneak Peek With Robert Kirkman,"" conversation with the producers, trailer, and six mini-featurettes featuring assorted cast members.",3,Surprisingly good for a TV series,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,1741,"['Walking', 'Dead', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'ambitious', 'horror', 'series', 'made', 'specifically', 'television', 'notion', 'cannibalistic', 'zombies', 'roaming', 'mindlessly', 'only', 'one', 'instinct', 'eat', 'living', 'way', 'taboo', 'small', 'screen', 'AMC', 'took', 'show', 'premiered', 'appropriately', 'Halloween', 'night', '2010.County', 'Sheriff', 'Rick', 'Grimes', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'coma', 'utterly', 'alone', 'post-apocalyptic', 'zombie', 'world', 'world', 'gone', 'series', 'based', 'Robert', 'Kirkman', 'successful', 'popular', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'story', 'weeks', 'months', 'follow', 'apocalypse', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'contained', 'two-disc', 'set.On', 'plus', 'side', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'graphic', ""n't"", 'cut', 'away', 'more', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'Fans', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'outstanding', 'zombies', 'ghastly', 'make-up', 'sequences', 'zombies', 'feast', 'victims', 'acting', 'overall', 'good', 'particularly', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'sheriff', 'Jon', 'Bernthal', 'Deputy', 'Shane', 'Walsh', 'Jeffrey', 'DeMunn', 'retired', 'Dale.The', 'downside', 'first', 'episode', 'are', 'long', 'stretches', 'talk', 'talk', 'talk', 'little', 'zombie', 'footage', 'get', 'lot', 'background', 'eight', 'main', 'characters', 'maybe', 'more', 'really', 'care', 'zombies', 'are', 'primary', 'attraction', 'When', 'do', 'appear', ""'re"", 'creepy', 'scary', 'make', 'exciting', 'moments.Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'generous', 'addition', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'zombie', 'make-up', 'Sneak', 'Peek', 'Robert', 'Kirkman', 'conversation', 'producers', 'trailer', 'six', 'mini-featurettes', 'featuring', 'assorted', 'cast', 'members']",N/A

My review on the dvd will come when its released which I just pre ordered..The show of course based off the hit graphic novel by Robert Kirkman and it follows Officer Rick Grimes after he wakes up from a comoa to find out that zombies have taken over and now he must he find his wife and son.The show does a great job adapting the comic to the small screen. Adding some new storylines and characters, as well as changing the fates of some to add new conflicts to the fold. You still have most of the major characters. What makes the show really good for those who read the comics (which I have), they have new characters. So at times I dont know the fate  of them. Will they live, will they die..if so when and how.They did however leave out to me 4 characters (a husband and wife with their 2 young twin sons however the character of Carol seems to be a mixture of her character in the comics along with the wife mentioned). I didnt really care for the redneck brothers who arent in the comic, but not knowing their fate leaves me intrigued.This show does what so few comics have done, made an adaption that works.

1390044,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0049P1VHS,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","I did not want to get into AMC's The Walking Dead, because it is what a like to call, addictive television. I try to avoid shows like this, but I was at a friend house the other week and there were a group of people watching it, so I really didn't have a choice and I got sucked into it's grip. The reason I don't like to watch shows like this is because it's based on a book, which usually means, the show is amazing and very well written until they reach the end of the book and have to come up with new stuff on their own. At that point, the quality of the story quickly diminishes and the show either gets boring or goes way over the top. As I watched the first two seasons of The Walking Dead over the course of a couple weeks, I found that the same was true for it. The first season was an absolute delight and I hated the fact that it was only six episodes. The second season started out pretty good also, but that's when the book must have ended and things changed. This powerful, exciting show became extremely predictable, with every episode featuring about forty minutes of talking and five minutes of action. So, if I was so turned off by it at that point, why am I watching the new episodes right now? Addictive television! Now that I know the characters and their stories I want answers to the same four questions as everyone else. Who is fighting with who, who is having sex with who, how will the story end, and the big one, who lives and who dies. Similar to soap operas, shows like the Walking Dead, for the most part, aren't well written, are extremely predictable, and don't really develop much after the initial impact. I didn't see a single episode in the second or third season that I enjoyed as much as I did every episode from season 1. I am nevertheless invested in the show and what happens now, and to be honest it's not that it's a bad show. I really like Sarah Wayne Callies from Prison Break and Norman Reedus's character is the one guy who really evolved into someone who fascinates me. The action scenes, as well as the effects are terrific, and they do have a pretty talented cast. It's my hope that as it continues to gain popularity, that the writers turn to other sources, perhaps the author of the book or even some fan fiction for alternative ideas on how to keep things fresh and interesting, because right now, aside from the question of who lives and who dies, there isn't much there to attract new viewers to the show. If you like dark stories, horror, and end of the world type fiction, I'd give the show a try, but if you're a newbie whose thinking about getting into the Walking Dead, I warn you, the first season is amazing and will suck you in, but after that, as of yet, it hasn't gotten any better.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review!

Also, there is commentary that cna be gotten to go with this for free, making everything understood. The group has trekked for a while and has gotten to what they think is a safe place, right outside of zombie reach. This leads them to feel like they are in fgood hands, and it leads to a time of rest. The only problem with that is not asking the right questions, and questions are always good things.As the season ends, you expect a lot fo the undead to rear their heads. That is not the point of this season, however, and good things happen in the human part of the drama. Good acting comes forth, some motion pushes people on, and some of the cast dies out in a turn that makes the cast keep moving.I liked the way everything ended and it makes sense to go this route. I origianlly downloaded this and the episodes that goes with it, and I think they go good together.

1390048,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0049P1VHS,trebe,"[0, 0]","AMC's The Walking Dead, based on the graphic novels by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard, convincingly captured the imagination of the public in its inaugural season.  The degree of success of a series about a world where the undead prey on the living, probably came as a major surprise to some, as in recent years, there has been no shortage of ""zombie"" or ""outbreak"" films, such as28 Days Later(2002), and it's radical sequel,28 Weeks Later(2007).There are many reasons why The Walking Dead achieved such popularity, starting with the high quality of the source material.  With the graphic novels sometimes serving as storyboards, the goal of the series' creative team, which includes Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption,The Mist) and Gale Anne Hurd (The Terminator films), was to bring a fictional world to life.  Characterized by high production values, The Walking Dead features stunning visuals, creative camerawork, and top drawer special effects, with contributions from genre effects wizard, Greg Nicotero (Sin City, Planet Terror,Predators).It's quite remarkable, that a program which routinely features brutal gore and graphic violence worthy of a hard R rating, would be produced on a cable network like AMC.  The apparent lack of censor ship is amazing, as series does not shy away from showing zombies hacked to pieces, or splattered apart.Set in Georgia, the story follows the aftermath of a viral outbreak that turns victims into mindless flesheaters, that behave much like George Romero's traditional zombies.  The story begins with Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) a law enforcement officer who is in the hospital when the outbreak occurs.  Upon waking from a coma, Grimes finds himself in a strange and terrible world where death is all around.Frank Darabont does a fine job of directing, and the series contains some memorable visuals, such as Grimes entering Atlanta on a horse, and encountering zombies on the street.  While suspenseful and at times shockingly brutal, The Walking Dead is by no means perfect.  Leaving the town where he lives, Grimes wisely gathers a cache of weapons, but seems to neglect to take food and other basic supplies.  Headed for Atlanta in a truck, he runs out of gas.  While clearly not the most well-prepared guy, Grimes is truly blessed, as with help from a group of survivors, he escapes from the undead who have him trapped in an army tank, and then is miraculously reunited with his missing wife and son.While much that occurs is based on the graphic novels, the season finale, an expedition to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, is an exception.  While this adventure seems to suffer from plot conveniences and timing issues, some key background information is provided, and the stage is set for ""life on the road"" in Season Two.Much like a series like 24, being able to watch the episodes consecutively makes for a terrific viewing experience, where you can really become immersed into the world of The Walking Dead, at whatever pace you choose.  Some situations are ridiculous, or don't ring true, but the nature of this savage world is fairly consistent, with the high quality special effects contributing to the realism.  With a strong action component, character development occasionally suffers, but these are people that you can generally get behind and care about.The BBC's TV SeriesSurvivors(1975), and the2008 remakeof the same name, also explored post-apocalyptic worlds for an extended period of time.  There are some common elements with The Walking Dead, however no previous program had achieved the phenomenal success of AMC's production, which is entering its fourth season.  The zombie genre remains popular, and with good quality films in rather short supply, a series like The Walking Dead is very much appreciated.  It has issues, and may not be as original as some believe, but for a cable TV program, it offers much to fans who have grown weary of poor quality movies featuring the undead.",4,"has some flaws, but this post apocalyptic drama clearly captured the imagination of the public...",1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,3997,"['AMC', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'based', 'graphic', 'novels', 'Robert', 'Kirkman', 'Tony', 'Moore', 'Charlie', 'Adlard', 'convincingly', 'captured', 'imagination', 'public', 'inaugural', 'season', 'degree', 'success', 'series', 'world', 'where', 'undead', 'prey', 'living', 'probably', 'came', 'major', 'surprise', 'recent', 'years', 'been', 'shortage', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'films', 'such', 'as28', 'Days', 'Later', '2002', 'radical', 'sequel,28', 'Weeks', 'Later', '2007', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'achieved', 'such', 'popularity', 'starting', 'high', 'quality', 'source', 'material', 'graphic', 'novels', 'sometimes', 'serving', 'storyboards', 'goal', 'series', 'creative', 'team', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Mist', 'Gale', 'Anne', 'Hurd', 'Terminator', 'films', 'was', 'bring', 'fictional', 'world', 'life', 'Characterized', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'creative', 'camerawork', 'top', 'drawer', 'special', 'effects', 'contributions', 'genre', 'effects', 'wizard', 'Greg', 'Nicotero', 'Sin', 'City', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'Predators', '.It', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'program', 'routinely', 'brutal', 'gore', 'graphic', 'violence', 'worthy', 'hard', 'R', 'rating', 'would', 'be', 'produced', 'cable', 'network', 'AMC', 'apparent', 'lack', 'censor', 'ship', 'amazing', 'series', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'showing', 'zombies', 'hacked', 'pieces', 'splattered', 'apart.Set', 'Georgia', 'story', 'aftermath', 'viral', 'outbreak', 'victims', 'mindless', 'flesheaters', 'behave', 'much', 'George', 'Romero', 'traditional', 'zombies', 'story', 'Rick', 'Grimes', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officer', 'who', 'hospital', 'when', 'outbreak', 'waking', 'coma', 'Grimes', 'strange', 'terrible', 'world', 'where', 'death', 'around.Frank', 'Darabont', 'fine', 'job', 'directing', 'series', 'memorable', 'visuals', 'such', 'Grimes', 'entering', 'Atlanta', 'horse', 'encountering', 'zombies', 'street', 'suspenseful', 'times', 'shockingly', 'brutal', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'means', 'perfect', 'Leaving', 'town', 'where', 'Grimes', 'wisely', 'cache', 'weapons', 'neglect', 'take', 'food', 'other', 'basic', 'supplies', 'Headed', 'Atlanta', 'truck', 'gas', 'clearly', 'not', 'most', 'well-prepared', 'guy', 'Grimes', 'truly', 'blessed', 'help', 'group', 'survivors', 'undead', 'who', 'have', 'trapped', 'army', 'tank', 'then', 'miraculously', 'reunited', 'missing', 'wife', 'son.While', 'much', 'based', 'graphic', 'novels', 'season', 'finale', 'expedition', 'Center', 'Disease', 'Control', 'CDC', 'Atlanta', 'exception', 'adventure', 'suffer', 'plot', 'conveniences', 'timing', 'issues', 'key', 'background', 'information', 'provided', 'stage', 'set', 'life', 'road', 'Season', 'Two.Much', 'series', '24', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'episodes', 'consecutively', 'terrific', 'viewing', 'experience', 'where', 'can', 'really', 'become', 'immersed', 'world', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'pace', 'choose', 'situations', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'do', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'nature', 'savage', 'world', 'fairly', 'consistent', 'high', 'quality', 'special', 'effects', 'contributing', 'realism', 'strong', 'action', 'component', 'character', 'development', 'occasionally', 'suffers', 'are', 'people', 'can', 'generally', 'get', 'care', 'about.The', 'BBC', 'TV', 'SeriesSurvivors', '1975', 'the2008', 'remakeof', 'same', 'name', 'also', 'explored', 'post-apocalyptic', 'worlds', 'extended', 'period', 'time', 'are', 'common', 'elements', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'however', 'previous', 'program', 'had', 'achieved', 'phenomenal', 'success', 'AMC', 'production', 'entering', 'fourth', 'season', 'zombie', 'genre', 'popular', 'good', 'quality', 'films', 'rather', 'short', 'supply', 'series', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'very', 'much', 'appreciated', 'issues', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'original', 'believe', 'cable', 'TV', 'program', 'much', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'weary', 'poor', 'quality', 'movies', 'featuring', 'undead']",N/A

But I just couldn't get past the gazillion huge giant gaping gaps of logic (in the writing).  Spoiler alert hence forth:1) How does the main character, Grimes, end up in a COMA (for over a month!) from a gunshot to his ribcage?2) How does Grimes survive in a coma for what, several weeks, in a deserted hospital without any intake of water or food at all????  It had to be weeks without food or water, right?  Right?  Enough time for Grimes' best friend to start ""doing"" Grimes' wife--I assume she didn't just start having sex with the guy in just days.3) When Grimes heads to Atlanta to find his missing wife and son, why in hell would he abandon his police car for a horse!!!!?  Who the hell in their right mind would go horseback riding through a zombie infested landscape!?  And if he did find his wife and son while on horseback, how would all three ride on one horse?  And at the farm where he gets the horse, he doesn't even check the farm vehicles for gas? I mean, come on!  There's zero common sense given to the characters in this show!4) In Atlanta, Grimes ends up inside a tank surrounded by zombies and he never tries to start the tank!!??  I mean wouldn't you want to see if you could drive the tank to escape!?  Yet, he never even tries to start it.  Also, he's got a .50 caliber machine gun on top of the tank yet never thinks to try to use it to kill some of the zombies!5) The band of survivors that his son and wife are among AREN'T holed inside some defendable and secure location such as a bank, police station, prison or army base?  Instead, they're just OUTSIDE, unprotected, living in flimsy tents????  With no defenses beside a few strings of tin cans as a ""warning.""  Ah, yeah, guess what?  They get attacked and a bunch of survivors get killed.  What would you expect living outside in a zombie infested area!!!!?6) The band of survivors ""trapped"" in the department store have been ""surviving"" against the zombies for a month, yet they're barely armed at all????  Just a handgun or two and a hunting rifle.  In this country there are over 300 million guns, more guns than there are people.  Ah, if you're fighting against hordes of zombies to survive, don't you think every survivor would have a crapload of guns and ammo???? And the blonde woman with the silver pistol doesn't even know how to use it!  She never even thought to ask anyone how to fire her gun!!!!????  AND... what's with their clothes?  Instead of tactical clothing or army-type fatigues, they wear things like fashionable and pretty silk blouses????  And none of them wear any anti-zombie protective gear to protect themselves against bites?  No police riot gear, no bulletproof vests, no thick motorcross pants or jackets or gloves or helmets?7) And the survivors vehicles consist of a broken down old motorhome and an open-air jeep!?  When they could easily get tanks, armored trucks, military HUMVEES, buses, or brand NEW motorhomes????  I mean, nearly everyone's dead, they can take or use whatever vehicle they want.8) And guns!!!!  In one episode a gang of Latinos and a group of survivors are set to kill each other over one lousy bag of handguns and shotguns when there's military machine guns just sitting in the streets???  And the survivors are content with arming themselves with crummy revolvers and pump action shotguns when then easily could and should be armed with assault rifles, Saiga shotguns and/or military weaponry???9) And the characters are always saying there's no gas?  When they're constantly coming across hundreds if not thousands of idle vehicles?  There's no gas in ANY of them!?  But how would they know?  There's not one scene of any character checking a vehicle to see if it has gas in its tank!Honestly, it seems ZERO thought was put into writing this show from a stand point of logic.  The writers obviously didn't get into the minds of the characters or the situations they face and consequently there's NO plausibility to the character's actions in most scenes.  Too bad, because this could have been a good show--it's a good premise.

1390056,A3UKLX2A9T589C,B0049P1VHS,"TW Brown, Author, Editor, and Reviewer ""Todd ...","[5, 7]","The zombie infection is more contagious than even the staunches fan might realize.  For the past several days, and this week in particular, I've done my part to spread the infection.  My friends, coworkers, and casual acquaintances were unable to protect themselves.  My anticipation in regards to the AMC premiere of The Walking Dead has rippled through my social circles.  This has almost been like a study on seeing how a zombie outbreak might overwhelm society.Credit AMC for a brilliant promotional campaign complete with screaming crawlers and even the occasional Emergence Alert screen. The way they kept the initial commercials short, showing larger glimpses as the premiere neared, was a lesson on how to pull off an excellent teaser.Now, I must confess that there has been a layering sense of concern.  After all, I was a huge fan of the Terry Goodkind fantasy epic The Sword of Truth.  The only thing the televised version of that series got right was the casting.  The program itself had no resemblance to the books other than the names of the central characters.  In the lead-up to the premiere of the Walking Dead I went into it almost like a jilted lover.That notwithstanding, I have recently been likened to a kid waiting for Christmas.  My non-zombie-loving friends (gasp! Does such a creature exist?) could not help but be caught up in my enthusiasm.  Before long they were pulling me up and asking me questions. Truth be told I have never been so grateful that AMC has built a loyal following with Madmen and Breaking Bad.  Their reputation for quality has already been established.A few even warmed up with the IFC showing of Dead Set.  That was sort of like giving steak to an infant, but the British mini-series actually converted a few and amped their anticipation for the Walking Dead.Most of you are familiar with the story and the characters.  If not, I recommend picking up the graphic novels.  (feel free to peruse the reviews of The Walking Dead 1-12 posted right here at BuyZombie.com.)  what I want to talk about is how this adaptation looked...felt...sounded...adhered.  Should the fans who've waited commit to this? Should those new to this amazing graphic novel series open their eyes to what will be the newest BIG THING in horror?The answer is most assuredly yes.Congratulations (and a huge thank you) goes to Frank Darabont for not only giving us a faithful adaptation--so far--but added a depth to the characters that further put flesh on the bones to a great story.  Not only did he do a superb job in adapting Robert Kirkman's story, you can actually see what he reproduced some of Charlie Adlard picture panels to perfection.Of course a lot has to be said about the cast.  Andrew Lincoln sheds his European accent for a very believable Rick Grimes from Georgia.  Jon Bernthal is so likeable that I feel sorry that he is cast as Shane Walsh, Rick's friend and partner.We can't talk about a zombie story without mentioning the visceral factor...the blood and gore.  I think that they (the SFX and production team) set the tone right away in the opening scene.  All I need to say is: a little nine- or ten-year-old girl with a teddy bear.  YIKES!Kudos to Darabont and AMC.  The Walking Dead is going to be a hit.  It is going to bring the entire zombie genre to the next level.  Set your DVR, or better yet invite your friends over on Sunday night (who cares if it is on at 10:00 pm.) and make this the event that it deserves to be.The Walking Dead Part 2Episode 2 of AMC's brand new mega-hit, The Walking Dead, had a lot of pressure riding on it.  The first episode was so well received that it had water-coolers buzzing and even a Monday morning mention from Atlanta based CNN.  As a zombie fan, I'm sure I wasn't the only one fielding questions last week by those that got a first taste of our passion.  (I use that word collectively, why else would you be cruising this site?)Tonight was the first time we got to see how Frank Darabont would' flesh out' the story a bit.  He gave us some familiar faces in strange places.  Readers of the series know that Rick was rescued by Glenn and Glenn alone (also there was no tank.)  Andria was introduced in Atlanta and is already displaying the badass female character we have come to love.  The biggest divergence is Merle Dixon's introduction.  I liked it because it made me hate Dixon right away instead of wondering about him.  Michael Rooker did a fantastic casting choice.Rick's rescue is much more of an event--taking up all of episode 2--and as a fan of the graphic novel, I think I'm okay with it. Getting a glimpse of some of the characters at the base camp as well as part of the group encountered in Atlanta gave me a better understanding of the characters and how they will be used in the series.  Obviously, if this went exactly by the book, it would burn through the material much too fast.One of the side effects of the series as it is currently unfolding is my increased dislike in the character of Lori.  Sara Wayne Callies is fantastic at making me dislike her for no real reason.  Meanwhile, Steven Yeun amps the likeability factor of Glenn exponentially with every scene.Here my complaint.  The zombie climbing the fence?  Not so much.  Also...are they fast or slow?  I can't tell.  Granted, they don't sprint a la 28 days later, but they do get moving in a hurry when they see something they like.  I half expected the zombie from episode one that got off the bus and later saw Rick on the tank to recognize them during the escape.  The series seemed to tread a fine line with its zombie continuity in episode two.Enough can still not be said about the effects being used in this made-for-tv series.  So far it's enjoyable to watch but I will be waiting to see if Darabont blinks when he has to off the first of his cast that people are getting to know and love.  Readers of the series are very familiar with the fact that Robert Kirkman has no qualms with taking out a character or two every so often.  We all know some of the casualties looming on the horizon.Overall the episode was satisfying.  I did get elbowed in the ribs once or twice and asked by my friends ""can you really smear yourself with zombie guts and get away?""  In Kirkman's world the answer is yes and I remember how clever it was when I read it in episode one of the graphic novel.The Walking Dead Part 3The worst part about writing these reviews for the hit AMC series, The Walking Dead, is that on the first showing I have to take notes and jot down ideas.  This keeps me from actually watching the program for the sheer enjoyment factor.  I have to save that for one of the replays.  But...enough of my meaningless complaints.So, we start getting a better look at some of the supporting cast in this episode.  We've met Glen and Andria,  and of course there is the very likeable (?) Shane, and Rick's family: wife Lori and son carl.  This is all about getting a taste of Dale, the adorable Amy, and the ""charming"" Daryl Dixon.  That first group of names are people that we the people already know and have our minds made up on.  And then there are the ""strangers"" (i.e. Daryl, T-Dog and some of the bodies running around in the background).  Like former fave LOST, these look like potential cannon fodder as well as bodies to fill out the scenery.With the rescue mission of the eldest Dixon brother being coupled with the original `gun run' from the graphic novel, we get our first glimpse of hero-complex that will come to define Rick Grimes.  What must be commented on and complimented on is how well all of this is being dovetailed and layered in the opening episodes.Each of the actors and actresses being used in this story are proving to mesh wonderfully.  There is a lot being done with body language and facial expressions in the scenes and in the background.  Despite any of the credits that these people have piled up, the only familiar face for me was Shane (Jon Bernthal).So now everything is in place.  The normally tedious character introductions have been handled masterfully and are basically over as we hit the half way point in this six-episode season.  (We can only hope that the success of this series will bring a longer season WHEN it returns.)Of course, now is when the questions start to build for many of the fans who have read the series.  They're sitting right there on the tips of our tongues, and as we sit next to those unfamiliar to the story, we struggle to hold back and reveal nothing.  It is now that we must take that leap of faith and trust that Mr Darabont and company will keep to the structure of the story while continuing to add to the depth that makes this feel almost like we're getting bonus material in a re-release of volume one, Days Gone Bye.As of now, I am left with one raised eyebrow over a single line spoken by Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) ""You were the one that told me that he died."" And despite what we know about the future story line as originally written, I cant be the only one who truly enjoyed Shane's beat-down of Ed.  Doesn't that earn him at least a few Redemption Points?Episode three of AMC's The Walking Dead earns an Early Release for more and continued character development as well as a cast that does not have a single weak link.The Walking Dead episode 4Doubtless, you know by now, that AMC has renewed The Walking Dead for a second season.  I urge everyone to email them with praise and words of thanks.  Even better news, we'll get thirteen episodes instead of six.  Now...on to the show.Loss.  A very common theme in the zombie genre.  What didn't we say when we had the chance?  Why didn't we appreciate this or that until it was too late?  We now get some very real taste of that from many of the characters -both major and supporting--in the Walking Dead's fourth episode.  It ads some excellent depth, and ties us as viewers to the story in a way that the splatter fests that past themselves off as zombie fiction often fall short.However, this episode is the first to really raise some of those Legend of the Seeker flags.  The senior citizens...thugs with hearts of gold...brave granny.  All nice touches but Kirkman's story already has plenty of depth as well as material.  Ever since episode one, this story has edged farther and farther away from the original.  And this time, it felt like somebody grabbed the wheel and yanked it.  With only 2 episodes left, the Walking Dead seems to be walking a fine line where it risks loosing its core...the fans of the graphic novel.Of course, as soon as I started getting that sinking feeling...the campsite massacre happens.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the brutal and violent endings of Amy, Ed, and a bunch of faces in the crowd save the day.  As those characters bit the big one(forgive the expression) the ship was suddenly righted once more.  One hundred and forty seven seconds.  That is how long it took to put everything back on track.  All is tight in the Walking Dead world.Now that all of the serious stuff is out of my system, did Glenn have the best line in this episode or what.  After laying out a very well designed plan to retrieve the gun bag, Daryl asked ""hey,  kid, what did you do before this?""  Glenn's answer was: ""delivered pizza.  Why?""Daryl's insistence in rescuing Glenn, who he'd earlier referred to as a Chinaman when Glenn is in fact a Korean, offers up a subtle but yet deeper glimpse at a person who, up to this point, could easily be dismissed as a typical red neck racist.  It will be interesting to see how his role develops within the group.  Also, with the loss of Amy, I think it is safe for fans to assume that lives will not be spared in typical Hollywood fashion.  (also this event is a major catalyst for Andria -one of my favorite characters in the graphic novel--who begins to unfold as someone far more complex than we've seen so far.In an episode that began to scare me in a way that had nothing to do with the content, I am thrilled to see that the story line is back on track in the best hour of the series so far.Walking Dead Episode 5There have been some grumblings out there about AMC's newest hit, The Walking Dead.  Having read a multitude of interviews, I was already prepared for some story stretching and deviations from the original plot.  However, this doesn't seem to be the gripe.  Apparently if there isn't a disembowelment or a zombie getting its head blown off in every scene, some folks aren't happy.  Heaven forbid there be actual character depth and story content.  My guess is that these complaints are coming from the same people who mumble, ""braaains!"" when they think they are imitating a zombie.  Those same people completely miss the idea that if the first wave of zombies ate their victims brains, then there wouldn't be any new zombies.  Anyways, enough ranting...onto episode 5.This episode went a long way to leave an impression in regards to the individual characters in the story.  I believe that this sort of cinema is exactly what the zombie genre needs to be taken seriously.  Great stories can overcome the stereotype, and the walking dead is proof.  How many rehash versions of Romero's Dawn of the Dead do we need? In Episode 5, we now have very real people, full of flaws.  They're individuals that we can identify with, understand, or dislike.  How many of us have fantasized about the zombie apocalypse? What sort of super powers or McGiver like abilities do we bestow upon ourselves during these musing?  The beauty of what Darabont did here in pulling Kirkman's characters out of a two-dimensional medium and giving them 3 dimensional depth needs to be applauded in this episode.With one installment to go, we now have a group of people that aren't merely faces on the screen.  How many of you are still fans of Shane now?  I for one am absolutely NOT disappointed in season one.  (Other than it only being 6 episodes).  We now have proof that the zombie can be main-stream.  Even better, unlike vampires, there's no need to make things pretty.Fans of all things zombie should rejoice. We are no longer second rate citizens in the world of horror.  And, while some will doggedly resist this movement by cleaning to B grade standards and stereotypes and being more impressed by body count and blood splatter than by character and content we will embrace what can only be called an upgrade.As a final note, if somebody knows the composer responsible for the soundtrack of this show, I would love to know who it is.Walking Dead episode 6It is almost bittersweet. AMC's the Walking Dead has completed its sixth episode run. For the most part, it has won over the hearts of many, while also bringing fresh blood to the ranks of those who are now fan to the zombie genre.The fact that this episode spun away from the original storyline and embarked on a tangent unique to the television version, certainly had me curious as to the direction this finale would take.  There is a certain smug self-satisfaction to be had when watching the program with foreknowledge of what will occur.  Sitting next to someone who is commenting on what a `hottie' the character of Amy is while knowing she is destined for an unhappy ending is fun.  But like many fans of the graphic novel series, I had no idea what the hell was going to happen tonight.Loveable Shane is now the ultimate heel.  In a span of the first fifteen minutes.  But...we know what he saw at the hospital and he is still a tragic hero...until he tries to force himself on his partner and so-called best friend's wife.Next, we get one of the most in-depth explanations of the question we always ask, but never expect an answer to.  Once again we don't actually get a `why', but we do get a bit of a `what'; as in, ""what is this?""  the demonstration on the giant monitor of Test Subject #19 gives us something.  For many (like myself) that whole segment was almost unnecessary.  For folks getting their first taste...I'm sure it was fascinating.As far as the CDC arc of this story, I guess if they weren't certain that the series would be picked up (AMC is still a business after all) there had to be a decision going into production on how to wrap up this series on such a short run.  Doing this leaves an opening to return to the original story.  It strayed before and as we saw in episode 4, Derabont and company can be back on track in a matter of seconds.What we got in the final segment was the bonding of Dale and Andria, the death of another `extra' character (Jacqui) and the deepening of the wedge between Rich and Shane.  We even got a whispered secret from the doomed doctor Jenner just before Rick and his people depart (my guess is that the blood test results on his pregnant wife).  There is a conclusion of sorts, and a pretty explosion, but of course we all know that there is plenty of story to tell.This series will be a hit for seasons to come.  (Which begs the question, how are they going to keep Carl young unless they've hired an actor that carries the Gary Coleman-Webster gene?)  It uses the zombies in small doses instead of relying on them as a crutch.  This is not a B thriller or a cheap series, it is a STORY.  I said it in my series of reviews about the Kirkman graphic novel series, and I will repeat it here:  the zombie genre has a new king.

The digital transfer keeps the series ""look"" as it was presented on AMC intact. Colors are nice throughout and although the show looks a bit soft that appears to be intentional.If amazon is still filing this under DVD as well I can't comment on the DVD picture quality but have been told it looks quite good.The extras are quite nice for the show--there's nothing on the first disc but disc two of the Blu-ray is packed with goodies. We get a 30 minute documentary that focuses on the creation and development of the series.""Behind the Scenes Zombie Make-Up Tips"" is a clever short that let's us in on what it takes to make a zombie.We also get half a dozen short pieces that take us behind-the-scenes on specific episodes.""Zombie School"" demonstrates the training it takes to get people act like the undead.""Bicycle Girl"" gives us the background on the creation of one memorable zombie in particular and we get an 11 minute featurette on the Comic Con panel presentation of the show.We also get ""On Set with Andrew Lincoln"" letting the actor discuss his character. ""Hanging With Steve Yeun"", ""On Set With Robert Kirkman""(the graphic artist who created the original print version) and ""Inside Dale's RV"" each run about four minutes and are self explanatory featurettes.Could this set have been better? Sure--if we had a couple of commentary tracks from the writers/producers/directors that might have given us some additional ""meat"" to ""bite into"" and learn about the production of the series. Nevertheless, this is an extremely good set that fans of the series will enjoy. It's a pity the first season was so short and that fans have to wait so long for the new season to start.

Starting far back with Bela Lugosi's fantastic ""White Zombie"" all the way up through the masterpiece ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ending in satire with the hilarious ""Army of Darkness"" and ""Shaun of the Dead,"" I thought myself to be on safe ground in this harshly critical assessment.  Sometimes, it's a pleasure to be flat wrong.I watched all six episodes of this, and cannot wait for the next season.  It's an ensemble acting piece, so focus never lingers too long on any one particular character.  This is a brilliant opening gambit for television since the viewer can, in a way, vicariously share the dread of ""just getting to know someone"" and then have them ripped away, either by the evil of men, mischance, or zombie attack.  Some think that the acting is contrived.  I do not.  All of the characters are on edge, just up to the point of hysteria, and played consistently thus.  True, it can make for one-note dialogue and predictable, archetypal situations, but what other notes might there be in the opening month of the end of the world, and a world not only ending but grown hideously hostile to boot?  It will be interesting to see how the actors manage the change into something ""else"" as they adapt to a zombie-filled world, and I hope they are up to the challenge.  From the looks of things thus far, they are.And this makes the title especially provocative.  One would assume that ""The Walking Dead"" refers to zombies.  I am not sure of that at all.  Here, the undead are the backdrop to the action, not the action itself.  The action lies in the excellent ensemble acting and cleverly turned scripting.  It may well unfold that the living are the ones who end up truly meriting that disturbing title, not the once-human shambling mounds of flesh haunting the desolate streets of ""Necropolis Atlanta.""  I have an odd suspicion that by the end of season two, the mindless juggernaut of zombie hordes will be a pale shadow compared to the darker and more malevolent forces that can shape the human soul into something far more fearful and terrifying.  And these six shows set up that subtle possibility with suprising elegance as the normal turns suddenly abnormal and the ""brave new world"" or both urban and rural America comes bloodily undone.This is not a show for the faint of heart.  The make-up and effects for television are very well done and almost entirely convincing.  The adult situations, profanity, and desperate sexuality also make ""The Walking Dead"" unsuitable for minors.  But for adults, this is nothing less than a treat and not a ""guilty pleasure.""So spread the word.  Zombies are back, and very scary again.  Almost as scary as the people trying to outlive them.

It is a modern classic piece of filmography and deserves a chance to convince you of its greatness.  It is unlike any other show on cable and simply well-constructed and acted; these characters show us a side which answers how people would relate to a world completely changed and a life you would have to appreciate if given a chance to survive.  I have never been very drawn to comic stories, but this graphic novel series has completely changed my views and I am hooked!  I can't wait for the new season on October 16th!  I have everyone... aunts, uncles, cousins (of age, of course) and friends waiting in desperation.  This is clearly a show to collect and a series to be watched.  I have read ALL of the graphic novels to date and hope that you will too, so you'll understand what I am saying.  Robert Kirkman is a master of his craft.

1390076,A3QD59N3M7O7KB,B0049P1VHS,Xina143,"[2, 4]","Let me start this review with two things-there might NOT be spoilers in this, but I wanted to put that just in case I got carried away and two, I know little to nothing about the graphic novels.I saw a bit for this show on TVSquad, and thought we should check it out.  I love horror movies, as do the boys and zombies hold a special place in our heart. Good, bad, really bad...we like zombies, so ""The Walking Dead"" was right up our alley.If you watch this show just for the zombies, you won't be disappointed. For a TV show the makeup is amazing and very effective. The first episode has a scene with a female zombie (should I say, half a female zombie) that was striking. Rick, our hero, wakes up from a coma to a world he doesn't know. He gets out of the hospital and is greeted by stark images that frankly, caused me to gasp. Bodies, upon bodies lined up on the hospital parking lot, military vehicles abandoned..what is going on?Without giving too much away, because I could easily write a 5000 word essay on just how great this series is...we are treated to zombie kids, zombie adults, we see the breakdown of humanity in the survivors as they struggle to stay alive, and that alone is enough to recommend this series, but there is something more here.Back to scene with the half female zombie. Rick encounters her in the park...it's just a head and torso, and she (it?) is dragging herself along the grass.  Our hero sees her, and rather than just simply be afraid, we get to see the range of emotions cross Rick's face-disgust, fear, confusion...and then he leaves. After he finds out what is going on, from a father and son (Dad is played by the amazing Lennie James) Rick returns to the park and 'takes care of the zombie.' And yet there was more to that scene than him simply getting rid of the enemy. There was a compassion there, and truth be told the scene touched me.THAT is what makes this show special. sure the zombies are wild, sure there are some great kills, but this is a story about surviving, and pushing through and fighting for what you think might still be out there-humanity, safety, love, family...a home.The DVD has some fun extras including a funny little bit about ""going to zombie school."" The boys and I got a kick out of this and I seriously thought about looking for work as a Zombie choreographer.We love this show so much we even had a crazy birthday cake inspired by the hospital scene!
