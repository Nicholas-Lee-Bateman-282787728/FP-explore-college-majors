It's full of comedy and drama and overall the interactions seem so realistic that you forget it's a show. I love BET for picking up the show and continuing it after the other idiots cancelled it. It deserves to be on the air, especially as it's one of the few great shows that targets African Americans.",5,Love it!,1295481600,"01 20, 2011",2011,362,"['one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'full', 'comedy', 'drama', 'overall', 'interactions', 'seem', 'so', 'realistic', 'forget', 'show', 'love', 'BET', 'picking', 'up', 'show', 'continuing', 'other', 'idiots', 'cancelled', 'be', 'air', 'especially', 'one', 'few', 'great', 'shows', 'targets', 'African', 'Americans']",The Game: Season 1

This season is a hilarious representation of the lives of professional football players & has become my entertainment crack!I got sucked into the lives of wide-eyed rookie receiver, Derwin Davis & his ""Girl"" Melanie Barnett as they struggle to fit in with fellow players, players' wives/girlfriends, image consultants & agents while fighting to maintain their relationship & down-to-earth values.  The ups & downs of their relationship are balanced out by the lives & problems of 2 of his teammates:Jason & Kelly Pitts - married for 7 years, Jason is fearful about the impending end of his football career & having never won the championship while Kelly battles her feelings of resentment towards Jason for his controlling behavior; andMalik Wright & Tasha Mack - star QB & his ""Momager"".  Malik at 25 yrs is living it up as ""The $40-million Kid"" but wonders if it's time to cut the apron strings while Tasha fights to prove herself in the business world as more than just the lucky woman who gave birth to a star athlete.I completely enjoyed my marathon viewing of the first season of this show while trapped inside by the snow and recommend that those who enjoyed the series, GIRLFRIENDS give it a chance.",5,The Game: The First Season,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,1416,"['Thank', 'goodness', 'set', 'reached', 'crippling', 'snowstorms', 'Northeast', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'regularly', 'when', 'aired', 'miss', 'more', 're-runs', 'watch', 'decided', 'buy', 'set', 'season', 'hilarious', 'representation', 'lives', 'professional', 'football', 'players', 'become', 'entertainment', 'crack', 'got', 'sucked', 'lives', 'wide-eyed', 'rookie', 'receiver', 'Derwin', 'Davis', 'Girl', 'Melanie', 'Barnett', 'struggle', 'fit', 'fellow', 'players', 'players', 'wives/girlfriends', 'image', 'consultants', 'agents', 'fighting', 'maintain', 'relationship', 'down-to-earth', 'values', 'ups', 'downs', 'relationship', 'are', 'balanced', 'out', 'lives', 'problems', '2', 'teammates', 'Jason', 'Kelly', 'Pitts', 'married', '7', 'years', 'Jason', 'fearful', 'impending', 'end', 'football', 'career', 'having', 'never', 'won', 'championship', 'Kelly', 'feelings', 'resentment', 'towards', 'Jason', 'controlling', 'behavior', 'Wright', 'Tasha', 'Mack', 'star', 'QB', 'Momager', 'Malik', '25', 'yrs', 'living', 'up', '40-million', 'Kid', 'wonders', 'time', 'cut', 'apron', 'strings', 'Tasha', 'fights', 'prove', 'business', 'world', 'more', 'just', 'lucky', 'woman', 'who', 'gave', 'birth', 'star', 'athlete.I', 'completely', 'enjoyed', 'marathon', 'viewing', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'trapped', 'snow', 'recommend', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'GIRLFRIENDS', 'give', 'chance']",The Game: Season 1

I recently got season 1 on DVD and all I can say is I LOVE THIS SHOW and that I should've watched more of it when it first aired. I think it's a great show filled with laughs, good times, and tears.

1262790,A33UM46W6NJAPO,B002CLKV68,watching TV is my job,"[3, 4]","This was a super show. I must admit, I preferred Girlfriends just a bit more, but this was excellent adult TV fare. The cast was perfect; the production values were slick. The stories could be fun and silly, but never dumbed down. Who can ever forget Malik and Girl Melanie's late night ""girl talk"" session. Or Tasha Mack and Kelly's initial attempts at friendship (""I heard your daughter screaming and just wanted to see if it was a Penny in Good Times situation...). Rick Fox and Robin Givens playing themselves was genius! An then, of course, there is Tee Tee! Mara Brock Akil, who created both Girlfriends and The Game, rules.
