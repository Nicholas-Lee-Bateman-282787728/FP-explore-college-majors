857007,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,B00062IVPI,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[2, 4]","When I was a kid growing up in the sixties, I saw every one of these films at one time or another, usually on late night TV shows hosted by entertainingly campy personalities going by names like Count Gregor or 3-D Danny.  At the time, the Harryhausen films registered as unforgettable, cinematic masterpieces, the likes of which, I was certain, could never be replicated.  And, in a way, I was correct.  After hastily purchasing the Harryhausen collection, I excitedly put each DVD into the slot, expecting, I guess, to recapture some of the adventurous spirit the films had represented in my youth.  The end result, of course, is that Harryhausen's painstaking animation and special effects still hold up remarkably well, even in this age of (often ghastly) CGI effects.The problem I have is with the stories--and maybe this is just me having grown accustomed to sci-fi and adventure movies clipping along at a breakneck pace.  But the obligatory set-up at the beginning of most of the films seems to drag on and on (""Mysterious Island"" and ""20,000,000 Miles to Earth"" are the exceptions, and in my opinion, the most exciting films of the lot).  This isn't really the fault of Ray Harryhausen since the infinitely boring prelude to the action is an element present in almost every film of this ilk produced in the 1950's.  It's necessary, I suppose, but I can only assume that I must have been a much more patient child than I am as an adult.  Ultimately, I remembered most of these films as being more fun than they actually are, but maybe it's because I've outgrown them.  They're certaily worth viewing for the special effects, if not much else.",3,"Masterful Special Effects, Less Masterful Storytelling",1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,1650,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', 'sixties', 'saw', 'one', 'films', 'one', 'time', 'usually', 'late', 'night', 'TV', 'shows', 'hosted', 'entertainingly', 'campy', 'personalities', 'going', 'names', 'Count', 'Gregor', '3-D', 'Danny', 'time', 'Harryhausen', 'films', 'registered', 'unforgettable', 'cinematic', 'masterpieces', 'likes', 'was', 'certain', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'replicated', 'way', 'was', 'correct', 'hastily', 'purchasing', 'Harryhausen', 'collection', 'excitedly', 'put', 'DVD', 'slot', 'expecting', 'guess', 'recapture', 'adventurous', 'spirit', 'films', 'had', 'represented', 'youth', 'end', 'result', 'course', 'Harryhausen', 'painstaking', 'animation', 'special', 'effects', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'remarkably', 'well', 'even', 'age', 'often', 'ghastly', 'CGI', 'effects.The', 'problem', 'have', 'stories', 'maybe', 'just', 'having', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'sci-fi', 'adventure', 'movies', 'clipping', 'along', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'obligatory', 'set-up', 'beginning', 'most', 'films', 'drag', 'Mysterious', 'Island', '20,000,000', 'Miles', 'Earth', 'are', 'exceptions', 'opinion', 'most', 'exciting', 'films', 'lot', ""n't"", 'really', 'fault', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', 'infinitely', 'boring', 'prelude', 'action', 'element', 'present', 'almost', 'film', 'ilk', 'produced', '1950', 'necessary', 'suppose', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'patient', 'child', 'am', 'adult', 'Ultimately', 'remembered', 'most', 'films', 'being', 'more', 'fun', 'actually', 'are', ""'ve"", 'outgrown', ""'re"", 'certaily', 'worth', 'viewing', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'much', 'else']",The Fantastic Films of Ray Harryhausen: Legendary Science Fiction Series (It Came from Beneath the Sea / Earth vs. the Flying Saucers / 20 Million Miles to Earth / Mysterious Island / H.G.

This slim, 3-disc box set is an affordable introduction to Harryhausen's sci-fi work, with two totally cool movies and one that's kind of lame, but still has some cool special effects. Here they are in chronological order:""It Came From Beneath The Sea"" (1955) is the weakest of the three films.  It's a Godzilla-y B.E.M. movie, with a giant radioactive octopus that destroys the Golden Gate bridge and trashes the San Francisco waterfront. The problem lies with the script: it's not actually a snoozer, but the ending is rushed and unsatisfying. A typical drive-in B-movie feature, and fine for the genre, but not totally mindblowing.""Earth vs. The Flying Saucers"" (1956) is awesome. It's one of those methodical, formulaic 50s sci-fi films where the set-up seems leaden by modern storytelling standards, with stock characters such as the virile scientist and his spunky and surprisingly capable girlfriend, who have to work through all the plot points before the action can take place... However, compared to many of its contemporaries this has a brisk, substantive script, and when the big battle with the UFOs finally happens, it's truly dazzling. Great special effects - amazing, actually, with a level of destruction and unrestrained chaos that's pretty breathtaking: you can still hear the echoes of the original audiences cheering with amazement and delight as one national monument after another gets pulverized in the epic battle. Bye, bye, nation's capitol! If you want to see where ""Mars Attacks"" and ""Independence Day"" got their Washington DC-destroying inspiration from, this is it. Highly recommended!""20 Million Miles To Earth"" (1957) is a great monster movie, with a very sympathetic creature, ala Frankenstein and King Kong. Transported to Earth by an American space expedition, an infant alien is quickly trapped and harassed, chased across Italy until it rampages through the landmarks of ancient Rome. A fast-moving, action-packed plot with some fun romantic intrigue that rings truer than most. Very sad ending. Also highly recommended.Equally rewarding are the special bonus features, particularly the longer documentaries about Ray Harryhausen and his craft.

Add to that the special features ""The Harryhausen Chronicles"" (narrated by Lenord Nemoy), ""The Making of 'Earth vs. the Flying Sausers'"" and The Collectable Scrapbook and you have a real history lesson on Ray Harryhausen and Dynamation.When Ray received a special Oscar in 1992, Master of Ceremonies Tom Hanks professed his love for Ray and his presenter and long-time friend science-fiction writer Ray Bradbury did as well.  In this review I profess mine.One note:  the movies are in Black & White but the special features and some of the previews are in colour.

Top FX scene: the moon vessel takes off!)3. 20 Million Miles to Earth. (Ray's ""King Kong"" homage, set in Rome.

The scripts of these are pretty good, though when seen from the standpoint of our era of relativism, they can seem a bit one-dimensional.I would say they fall into categories.  First, there are shoot-em-up monster flicks.  These (It came..., Earth v...) are not complex or very sophisticated films, but they do strive to have some interesting characters.  Earth v., I admit, has rather flat acting, but I did like the scientist-hero guy.Second, there are really good scifi films, Mysterious and 20 Million:  these have good characters and actors set in pretty complex plots.  Mysterious is the best of the lot in my view, and I throughly enjoyed it as did my kids.  20 is also good, as the viewer does feel some for the monster.  They are both scary and keep the viewer wondering what and why the whole time.Third, there is the zany First Men, which features a silly genius type and a subtly bizarre civilization on the Moon.  Alas, it was too much of a kids' film for my taste, but then my kids liked it while I could exercise my imagination with the elaborate insect culture.Of course, what binds them all is the masterful special effects of Harryhausen, which are crude by today's digital standards but really fun and vivid.Warmly recommended.

But at $6 a disk you get several hours of silly fun for your money; and the special effects are at points impressive - not because they are fantastic, but because some of them are pretty remarkable given the limited resources that were available. The flying saucers in Earth Vs. are really pretty good. In First Men the effects are good enough to blend into the background (almost) and let you focus on the story and the acting (which turns out to be a mistake, given the deliberately campy acting.)In terms of the actual movies themselves... First Men is chock full of silly, and at points irritating, overacting and desperate grabs for cheap laughs. It doesn't quite work. But Earth Vs. takes itself seriously, and does well at being a solid sci fi tale. Mysterious Island is a strange mismash of Jules Verne and Robinson Crusoe, mostly the latter. It's notable for the absurdly short skirt they stuffed the heroine into. The remainder are solidly in B movie territory. If you want to see Washngton DC, the Golden Gate bridge and other noteworthy locales smashed up, these are your films. 20 Million is actually quite sad; the alien gets your full sympathy from the first moment he's on screen.In all of them, scientific accuracy gets a big fat zero, putting them solidly below many other sci fi flicks of the era, which is saying something. (First Men, as a novel, makes an attempt at it, though it had fantastic elements as well. As a movie, almost all of that is eliminated.) These movies are about special effects first and foremost, story second, and science nowhere.I'll probably re-watch Earth a few times. The others will make good gag gifts.",3,"Awful, yet fun",1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,1752,"['important', 'recognise', 'are', '1950s/early', '60s', 'sci', 'fi', 'not', 'best', 'sci', 'fi', 'either', '6', 'disk', 'get', 'several', 'hours', 'silly', 'fun', 'money', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'points', 'impressive', 'not', 'are', 'fantastic', 'are', 'pretty', 'remarkable', 'given', 'limited', 'resources', 'were', 'available', 'flying', 'saucers', 'Earth', 'Vs.', 'are', 'really', 'pretty', 'good', 'First', 'Men', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'blend', 'background', 'almost', 'let', 'focus', 'story', 'acting', 'out', 'be', 'mistake', 'given', 'deliberately', 'campy', 'acting', 'terms', 'actual', 'movies', 'First', 'Men', 'chock', 'full', 'silly', 'points', 'irritating', 'overacting', 'desperate', 'grabs', 'cheap', 'laughs', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'Earth', 'Vs.', 'seriously', 'well', 'being', 'solid', 'sci', 'fi', 'tale', 'Mysterious', 'Island', 'strange', 'mismash', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'mostly', 'latter', 'notable', 'absurdly', 'short', 'skirt', 'stuffed', 'heroine', 'remainder', 'are', 'solidly', 'B', 'movie', 'territory', 'want', 'see', 'Washngton', 'DC', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'bridge', 'other', 'noteworthy', 'locales', 'smashed', 'up', 'are', 'films', '20', 'Million', 'actually', 'quite', 'sad', 'alien', 'full', 'sympathy', 'first', 'moment', 'screen.In', 'scientific', 'accuracy', 'big', 'fat', 'zero', 'putting', 'solidly', 'many', 'other', 'sci', 'fi', 'flicks', 'era', 'saying', 'something', 'First', 'Men', 'novel', 'attempt', 'had', 'fantastic', 'elements', 'well', 'movie', 'almost', 'eliminated', 'movies', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'first', 'foremost', 'story', 'second', 'science', 'nowhere.I', ""'ll"", 'probably', 're-watch', 'Earth', 'few', 'times', 'others', 'will', 'make', 'good', 'gag', 'gifts']",The Fantastic Films of Ray Harryhausen: Legendary Science Fiction Series (It Came from Beneath the Sea / Earth vs. the Flying Saucers / 20 Million Miles to Earth / Mysterious Island / H.G.
