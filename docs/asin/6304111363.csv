402119,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6304111363,Acute Observer,"[0, 3]","Birdman of Alcatraz, 1962 filmThe film begins with a view of Alcatraz Island, then a Federal prison for dangerous convicts. Robert Stroud spend his adult life in prison since 1909. A train transports prisoners from Washington State to Leavenworth Kansas. Stroud breaks a window. Prisons have rules for inmates. Stroud has a hair-trigger temper. What's eating him? Live music at mealtime. ""I just follow the rules."" Stroud kills a guard! He has no remorse. Stroud is sentenced to hang. His mother says goodbye, then visited a Senator in Washington to ask for clemency. His sentence was commuted to life in solitary. ""I'll be damned."" Stroud makes an enemy of the warden. One stormy rainy day he finds a baby sparrow in the prison yard and adopts it. He feeds it by catching insects for food. Is he going ""bugs""?The film shows his work to train a sparrow. The new warden allows him to keep it. Other inmates were allowed birds as well. Stroud gets two canaries as well. In time Stroud learns better manners. A wooden box provides raw material for cages. He treats a sick canary, and finds the problem. ""How many, Stroud?"" One egg hatches. Stroud's aviary grows over time. Septic fever strikes the canaries, some die. Stroud reads about poultry diseases, and tries cures. Finally one method works. Stroud writes an article for a Canary Journal on diseases. A woman visits him with a business proposition to sell these cures. Then a new law bans pets for prisoners. Stroud tries propaganda to change the rules. Will a common-law marriage have an effect? The publicity makes the news. ""The public has a short memory.""Stroud makes a deal, he will raise canaries and the Government will take the profits. His mother warns him against Stella Johnson; Stroud breaks with her. The freed birds fly around his cell. Stroud gets a present - a used microscope for research. His research led to ""Stroud's Digest on Diseases of Birds"", a world-class book. But there is a surprise transfer to Alcatraz in the middle of the night! The guards also live on The Rock. Will Stroud write a new book? Will this cause trouble? Does prison create a bad attitude for prisoners? ""Parakeets are the coming thing."" ""Goodby, Bob."" In May 1946 two prisoners started a jail break. Stroud stayed in his cell. They had no hope for escape. Troops attacked the prison. In 1959 Stroud was transferred to another prison. Tom Gaddis wrote a book about Stroud and met him on the dock. In 1962 Stroud was in prison for 53 years.This movie is mostly boring with a few spots of action. It is overlong and deals with a unimportant event in history. How accurate is this story? [Was it inspired by ""I Want To Live""?] The film hints at Stroud's family connections but says little else about his background and personality. ""Alcatraz"" in Spanish means ""pelican"". When the warden (played by Karl Malden) uses the name ""Sekulovich"" is it an inside joke?",1,A Story about Robert Stroud,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,2903,"['Birdman', 'Alcatraz', '1962', 'filmThe', 'film', 'view', 'Alcatraz', 'Island', 'then', 'Federal', 'prison', 'dangerous', 'convicts', 'Robert', 'Stroud', 'spend', 'adult', 'life', 'prison', '1909', 'train', 'prisoners', 'Washington', 'State', 'Leavenworth', 'Kansas', 'Stroud', 'window', 'Prisons', 'have', 'rules', 'inmates', 'Stroud', 'hair-trigger', 'temper', 'What', 'eating', 'Live', 'music', 'mealtime', 'just', 'follow', 'rules', 'Stroud', 'guard', 'remorse', 'Stroud', 'sentenced', 'hang', 'mother', 'goodbye', 'then', 'visited', 'Senator', 'Washington', 'ask', 'clemency', 'sentence', 'was', 'commuted', 'life', 'solitary', ""'ll"", 'be', 'damned', 'Stroud', 'enemy', 'warden', 'One', 'stormy', 'rainy', 'day', 'baby', 'sparrow', 'prison', 'yard', 'catching', 'insects', 'food', 'going', 'bugs', 'film', 'work', 'train', 'sparrow', 'new', 'warden', 'keep', 'Other', 'inmates', 'were', 'allowed', 'birds', 'well', 'Stroud', 'two', 'canaries', 'well', 'time', 'Stroud', 'better', 'manners', 'wooden', 'box', 'raw', 'material', 'cages', 'sick', 'canary', 'problem', 'How', 'many', 'Stroud', 'One', 'egg', 'hatches', 'Stroud', 'aviary', 'grows', 'time', 'Septic', 'fever', 'canaries', 'die', 'Stroud', 'poultry', 'diseases', 'tries', 'cures', 'Finally', 'one', 'method', 'Stroud', 'article', 'Canary', 'Journal', 'diseases', 'woman', 'business', 'proposition', 'sell', 'cures', 'Then', 'new', 'law', 'pets', 'prisoners', 'Stroud', 'propaganda', 'change', 'rules', 'Will', 'common-law', 'marriage', 'have', 'effect', 'publicity', 'news', 'public', 'short', 'memory', 'Stroud', 'deal', 'will', 'raise', 'canaries', 'Government', 'will', 'take', 'profits', 'mother', 'Stella', 'Johnson', 'Stroud', 'freed', 'birds', 'fly', 'cell', 'Stroud', 'present', 'used', 'microscope', 'research', 'research', 'led', 'Stroud', 'Digest', 'Diseases', 'Birds', 'world-class', 'book', 'surprise', 'transfer', 'Alcatraz', 'middle', 'night', 'guards', 'also', 'live', 'Rock', 'Will', 'Stroud', 'write', 'new', 'book', 'Will', 'cause', 'trouble', 'Does', 'prison', 'create', 'bad', 'attitude', 'prisoners', 'Parakeets', 'are', 'coming', 'thing', 'Goodby', 'Bob', 'May', '1946', 'two', 'prisoners', 'started', 'jail', 'break', 'Stroud', 'stayed', 'cell', 'had', 'hope', 'escape', 'Troops', 'attacked', 'prison', '1959', 'Stroud', 'was', 'transferred', 'prison', 'Tom', 'Gaddis', 'wrote', 'book', 'Stroud', 'met', 'dock', '1962', 'Stroud', 'was', 'prison', '53', 'years.This', 'movie', 'mostly', 'boring', 'few', 'spots', 'action', 'overlong', 'deals', 'unimportant', 'event', 'history', 'How', 'accurate', 'story', '[', 'Was', 'inspired', 'Want', 'Live', 'film', 'hints', 'Stroud', 'family', 'connections', 'little', 'else', 'background', 'personality', 'Alcatraz', 'Spanish', 'means', 'pelican', 'When', 'warden', 'played', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'name', 'Sekulovich', 'inside', 'joke']",Birdman of Alcatraz VHS
402120,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304111363,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I will say this; I don't think that `Birdman of Alcatraz' is a remarkable movie, and I have some issues with the acting, but I also feel that the film is a touching and moving experience that is well worth watching; at least once.  After watching the phenomenal `The Leopard' I have to say I was expecting greatness from Lancaster, and while I think he was effective I found myself a little numb to his performance.The film tells of convicted killer Robert Stoud.  During his years in prison he fought for a chance to truly reform himself through the caretaking of birds.  He studied them and became widely known for his knowledge of their diseases.  Despite internal opposition, Stoud continued to develop that knowledge, which in turn led to his complete and total emotional change; going from a reserved brute of a man to a king hearted and compassionate one.The film has a lot to say even if it doesn't appear to say much at all.  This is a blessing and a malediction.  I often find films that are subtle in their delivery to be all the more affective, because they really reach you in an unexpected and lasting way; much more so than a film that browbeats you with its views on a subject.  `Birdman of Alcatraz' is like that in that it is very quiet and slowly paced, so as to allow the audience to sink into the message being touted.  The malediction is that it at times can appear so quiet that it loses the interest of the audience.  A lot of this can be chalked up to Lancaster's performance, which is a times rather dull.  I understand the importance of being understated, but there are long stretches where Lancaster is virtually non-existent here.  If it weren't for the commanding performances by Thelma Ritter (who is sorely underused) and Karl Malden the film could have been labeled as boring.I think that the underlying message (or overlapping if you so please) of prisoner reform is a very important one and thus needs to be heard; and overall I think the film handles it rather well.  I felt that recent films like `The Shawshank Redemption' handled it much better and thus picked up the ball that was dropped and carried it further so-to-speak.Still, this is a fine film that will be enjoyed and should be seen.  Director John Frankenheimer knows how to control his film, delivering a sharply constructed picture that captures a mood and delivers that human feeling.  This is much better overall than Frankenheimer's other 1962 film `The Manchurian Candidate'; that's for sure.  It is not superb, but it is very good.",4,"Slow, somber and ultimately quite touching...",1237939200,"03 25, 2009",2009,2537,"['will', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Birdman', 'Alcatraz', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'have', 'issues', 'acting', 'also', 'feel', 'film', 'touching', 'moving', 'experience', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'watching', 'phenomenal', 'Leopard', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'expecting', 'greatness', 'Lancaster', 'think', 'was', 'effective', 'found', 'little', 'numb', 'performance.The', 'film', 'tells', 'convicted', 'killer', 'Robert', 'Stoud', 'years', 'prison', 'fought', 'chance', 'truly', 'reform', 'caretaking', 'birds', 'studied', 'became', 'widely', 'known', 'knowledge', 'diseases', 'internal', 'opposition', 'Stoud', 'continued', 'develop', 'knowledge', 'turn', 'led', 'complete', 'total', 'emotional', 'change', 'going', 'reserved', 'brute', 'man', 'king', 'hearted', 'compassionate', 'one.The', 'film', 'lot', 'say', 'even', ""n't"", 'appear', 'say', 'much', 'blessing', 'malediction', 'often', 'find', 'films', 'are', 'subtle', 'delivery', 'be', 'more', 'affective', 'really', 'reach', 'unexpected', 'lasting', 'way', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'film', 'views', 'subject', 'Birdman', 'Alcatraz', 'very', 'quiet', 'slowly', 'paced', 'so', 'allow', 'audience', 'sink', 'message', 'being', 'touted', 'malediction', 'times', 'can', 'appear', 'so', 'quiet', 'interest', 'audience', 'lot', 'can', 'be', 'chalked', 'up', 'Lancaster', 'performance', 'times', 'rather', 'dull', 'understand', 'importance', 'being', 'understated', 'are', 'long', 'stretches', 'where', 'Lancaster', 'virtually', 'non-existent', 'here', 'were', ""n't"", 'commanding', 'performances', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'who', 'sorely', 'underused', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'labeled', 'boring.I', 'think', 'underlying', 'message', 'overlapping', 'so', 'please', 'prisoner', 'reform', 'very', 'important', 'one', 'thus', 'needs', 'be', 'heard', 'overall', 'think', 'film', 'rather', 'well', 'felt', 'recent', 'films', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'handled', 'much', 'better', 'thus', 'picked', 'up', 'ball', 'was', 'dropped', 'carried', 'further', 'so-to-speak.Still', 'fine', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'Director', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'how', 'control', 'film', 'delivering', 'sharply', 'constructed', 'picture', 'mood', 'delivers', 'human', 'feeling', 'much', 'better', 'overall', 'Frankenheimer', 'other', '1962', 'film', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'sure', 'not', 'superb', 'very', 'good']",Birdman of Alcatraz VHS
402121,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6304111363,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","I'm a sucker for movies based on true stories. This one is like that, but it's not one of the best. Just how interesting can a story be that takes place mostly in a prison?Funny thing is, Robert Stroud never had birds in Alcatraz. He had them in Leavenworth, and in fact was afforded considerable privileges I'm quite certain would never be allowed today. But when he was moved to Alcatraz, he was not permitted to have birds.It all started when Stroud was in the exercise yard when it started to storm. He found a broken branch with a bird nest in it, and in the nest a baby sparrow. I mean really baby, nearly a newborn. He picked it up and took it to his cell, and fashioned a little warm nest for it from one of his socks. He created a sort of mash for the bird out of a bit of his dinner and some bugs he managed to kill in his cell. He fed it to the bird on the end of a burnt wooden match stick.The bird survived, and Stroud used considerable ingenuity to create a cage for it, and even made a little cart with a harness and taught it to pull the cart. The other prisoners soon discovered that he was allowed to keep the bird, and they had their relatives send them canaries. Then one got bored with his two canaries and gave them to Stroud. Then the prisoner in the next cell (Telly Savalas) said his bird wouldn't sing, and agreed to loan it to Stroud ""for a year."" Stroud quickly discovered why it didn't sing: it was a female.Of course, next thing you know, there are five eggs in the nest. The movie did one very cool thing in filming the first baby canary's hatching. So cute, so funny; at one point he's wearing the small end of the egg like a Chinese hat. Apparently it was actually connected to his head.Stroud got involved in aviary medicine when an epidemic hit his birds -- by now there are cages all over his cell. He discovered a cure for an avian disease that was almost always fatal, and became known to bird lovers through several articles in bird magazines.Stroud's mother (Thelma Ritter) was a complicated character. When he killed a prison guard and was sentenced to be hanged, his mother went all the way to Washington, DC, and presented a petition for clemency to Mrs. Wilson, the president's wife. And in fact Wilson did commute his sentence. However, the judge at the trial had said ""kept in confinement until executed,"" so when he was not to be executed, the warden (Karl Malden) decides that meant he should be kept in solitary for the rest of his life.Mother was so gung ho about loving her son and protecting him and everything, but she went nuts with jealousy when Stroud had a visit from a widowed bird fancier who got to know him through his magazine articles. In fact, Stroud married this woman and they started a business together selling the remedies he had discovered. The warden tried to halt it, but Stroud out-smarted him when he married and his wife made a publicity campaign to insist he be allowed to keep his birds. Mother tried to tell him that his wife was no good for him, and it became clear she was jealous. So she told a reporter that she opposed his being paroled. ""My son is right where he belongs. He's safe in there,"" she told him. In reply, Stroud burned his mother's picture and declared that as far as he was concerned, she was dead.The warden was then called to Washington and helped create the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Later, he was assigned to the new prison at Alcatraz, and had Stroud transferred there. He enforced the rule that there were to be no pets. His wife came to San Francisco to see him, talking to him via telephone and seeing him through heavy glass. They could not touch. He persuaded her to go back to where she had lived before she met him, and open a pet store and sell canaries and parakeets, and his remedies.When a riot broke out in his cell block, Stroud stayed apart from the fight, but when the two people who had broken into the guards' arsenal and stolen a rifle and a handgun both died, he threw the guns out the window and the warden trusted him when he said that was all there were.Then Tom Gaddis wrote a book about Stroud, the one on which this movie was based. The warden died not long after it was published, and finally Stroud left Alcatraz, transferred to a medical prison of lower security. According to Wikipedia, Stroud died in that prison the year following the release of this film.It's interesting because it's based on a true story, although Wikipedia says many of the prisoners who knew him did not feel it was all that accurate, especially when he is depicted as having become very gentle and soft-spoken. Apparently they resented the privileges he had in keeping his birds.",2,Disappointing Story Based on Real Life,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,4686,"[""'m"", 'sucker', 'movies', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'one', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'Just', 'how', 'interesting', 'can', 'story', 'be', 'place', 'mostly', 'prison', 'Funny', 'thing', 'Robert', 'Stroud', 'never', 'had', 'birds', 'Alcatraz', 'had', 'Leavenworth', 'fact', 'was', 'afforded', 'considerable', 'privileges', ""'m"", 'quite', 'certain', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'today', 'when', 'was', 'moved', 'Alcatraz', 'was', 'not', 'permitted', 'have', 'birds.It', 'started', 'when', 'Stroud', 'was', 'exercise', 'yard', 'when', 'started', 'storm', 'found', 'broken', 'branch', 'bird', 'nest', 'nest', 'baby', 'sparrow', 'mean', 'really', 'baby', 'nearly', 'newborn', 'picked', 'up', 'took', 'cell', 'fashioned', 'little', 'warm', 'nest', 'one', 'socks', 'created', 'sort', 'mash', 'bird', 'bit', 'dinner', 'bugs', 'managed', 'kill', 'cell', 'fed', 'bird', 'end', 'burnt', 'wooden', 'match', 'stick.The', 'bird', 'survived', 'Stroud', 'used', 'considerable', 'ingenuity', 'create', 'cage', 'even', 'made', 'little', 'cart', 'harness', 'taught', 'pull', 'cart', 'other', 'prisoners', 'soon', 'discovered', 'was', 'allowed', 'keep', 'bird', 'had', 'relatives', 'send', 'canaries', 'Then', 'one', 'got', 'bored', 'two', 'canaries', 'gave', 'Stroud', 'Then', 'prisoner', 'next', 'cell', 'Telly', 'Savalas', 'said', 'bird', 'would', ""n't"", 'sing', 'agreed', 'loan', 'Stroud', 'year', 'Stroud', 'quickly', 'discovered', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'sing', 'was', 'female.Of', 'course', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'are', 'five', 'eggs', 'nest', 'movie', 'did', 'one', 'very', 'cool', 'thing', 'filming', 'first', 'baby', 'canary', 'hatching', 'So', 'cute', 'so', 'funny', 'one', 'point', 'wearing', 'small', 'end', 'egg', 'Chinese', 'hat', 'Apparently', 'was', 'actually', 'connected', 'head.Stroud', 'got', 'involved', 'aviary', 'medicine', 'when', 'epidemic', 'hit', 'birds', 'now', 'are', 'cages', 'cell', 'discovered', 'cure', 'avian', 'disease', 'was', 'almost', 'always', 'fatal', 'became', 'known', 'bird', 'lovers', 'several', 'articles', 'bird', 'magazines.Stroud', 'mother', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'was', 'complicated', 'character', 'When', 'killed', 'prison', 'guard', 'was', 'sentenced', 'be', 'hanged', 'mother', 'went', 'way', 'Washington', 'DC', 'presented', 'petition', 'clemency', 'Mrs.', 'Wilson', 'president', 'wife', 'fact', 'Wilson', 'did', 'commute', 'sentence', 'However', 'judge', 'trial', 'had', 'said', 'kept', 'confinement', 'executed', 'so', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'executed', 'warden', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'meant', 'should', 'be', 'kept', 'solitary', 'rest', 'life.Mother', 'was', 'so', 'gung', 'ho', 'loving', 'son', 'protecting', 'everything', 'went', 'nuts', 'jealousy', 'when', 'Stroud', 'had', 'visit', 'widowed', 'bird', 'fancier', 'who', 'got', 'know', 'magazine', 'articles', 'fact', 'Stroud', 'married', 'woman', 'started', 'business', 'together', 'selling', 'remedies', 'had', 'discovered', 'warden', 'tried', 'halt', 'Stroud', 'out-smarted', 'when', 'married', 'wife', 'made', 'publicity', 'campaign', 'insist', 'be', 'allowed', 'keep', 'birds', 'Mother', 'tried', 'tell', 'wife', 'was', 'good', 'became', 'clear', 'was', 'jealous', 'told', 'reporter', 'opposed', 'being', 'paroled', 'son', 'right', 'where', 'safe', 'there', 'told', 'reply', 'Stroud', 'burned', 'mother', 'picture', 'declared', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', 'was', 'dead.The', 'warden', 'was', 'then', 'called', 'Washington', 'helped', 'create', 'Federal', 'Bureau', 'Prisons', 'Later', 'was', 'assigned', 'new', 'prison', 'Alcatraz', 'had', 'Stroud', 'transferred', 'there', 'enforced', 'rule', 'were', 'be', 'pets', 'wife', 'came', 'San', 'Francisco', 'see', 'talking', 'telephone', 'seeing', 'heavy', 'glass', 'could', 'not', 'touch', 'persuaded', 'go', 'back', 'where', 'had', 'lived', 'met', 'open', 'pet', 'store', 'sell', 'canaries', 'parakeets', 'remedies.When', 'riot', 'broke', 'out', 'cell', 'block', 'Stroud', 'stayed', 'apart', 'fight', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'broken', 'guards', 'arsenal', 'stolen', 'rifle', 'handgun', 'died', 'threw', 'guns', 'out', 'window', 'warden', 'trusted', 'when', 'said', 'was', 'there', 'were.Then', 'Tom', 'Gaddis', 'wrote', 'book', 'Stroud', 'one', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'warden', 'died', 'not', 'long', 'was', 'published', 'finally', 'Stroud', 'left', 'Alcatraz', 'transferred', 'medical', 'prison', 'lower', 'security', 'According', 'Wikipedia', 'Stroud', 'died', 'prison', 'year', 'following', 'release', 'film.It', 'interesting', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Wikipedia', 'many', 'prisoners', 'who', 'knew', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'accurate', 'especially', 'when', 'depicted', 'having', 'become', 'very', 'gentle', 'soft-spoken', 'Apparently', 'resented', 'privileges', 'had', 'keeping', 'birds']",Birdman of Alcatraz VHS

Burt Lancaster was one of these stars.  He wasn't known for quiet roles but if that was what was called for, he could deliver.  Lancaster's character, Robert Stroud, was a real criminal who had to find a way to endure long term penal confinement.  Today he might become an outsider artist or be attending college classes in prison.  Decades ago, when these things were yet unknown to our prison system, he had to be even more improvisational.  Thus, he became an expert on birds and their diseases and treatments after a wounded sparrow came to his attention.  This intense portrait of a character couldn't be any more opposite from Lancaster's most well known performance as Elmer Gantry, the barnstorming evangelist with earthy appetites.  Lancaster was also a very physical actor who liked to move around in a film but he was able to restrain himself beautifully within the confines of this role.  One really has to look to find junk roles done by Lancaster because he was very committed to the art and craft of acting, even at this point in his career when he was the most &quot;bankable.&quot; Everyone else involved in this film also does very good work but I don't think the project would have seen the light of day without Lancaster's coming on board.",5,Burt Lancaster: He Had It All,990144000,"05 18, 2001",2001,1396,"['know', 'someone', 'great', 'film', 'star', 'when', 'can', 'convey', 'great', 'charisma', 'deliver', 'A+', 'performance', 'very', 'quiet', 'role', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'was', 'one', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'known', 'quiet', 'roles', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'called', 'could', 'deliver', 'Lancaster', 'character', 'Robert', 'Stroud', 'was', 'real', 'criminal', 'who', 'had', 'find', 'way', 'endure', 'long', 'term', 'penal', 'confinement', 'Today', 'might', 'become', 'outsider', 'artist', 'be', 'attending', 'college', 'classes', 'prison', 'Decades', 'ago', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'yet', 'unknown', 'prison', 'system', 'had', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'improvisational', 'Thus', 'became', 'expert', 'birds', 'diseases', 'treatments', 'wounded', 'sparrow', 'came', 'attention', 'intense', 'portrait', 'character', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'opposite', 'Lancaster', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'performance', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'barnstorming', 'evangelist', 'earthy', 'appetites', 'Lancaster', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'physical', 'actor', 'who', 'liked', 'move', 'around', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'restrain', 'beautifully', 'confines', 'role', 'One', 'really', 'look', 'find', 'junk', 'roles', 'done', 'Lancaster', 'was', 'very', 'committed', 'art', 'craft', 'acting', 'even', 'point', 'career', 'when', 'was', 'most', 'quot', 'quot', 'Everyone', 'else', 'involved', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'project', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'Lancaster', 'coming', 'board']",Birdman of Alcatraz VHS

Burt Lancaster, one of the better actors, perhaps, of all time, gives a tremendous and very memorable performance. It's a clich? but this IS one story you will not forget!Director John Frrankenheimer also is one of the best ever. Check out his resume, if you question that last statement. He has some masterful camera shots in here. In addition to the talents of the director and main actor, you have Karl Malden,Thelma Ritter, Telly Savalas and Edmond O'Brien - no slouches they - in solid supporting roles. The DVD also helps highlight the wonderful black-and-white photography.Most prison stories are bleak and depressing. This one is not. Oh, it has some melodrama and a few tough scenes which include prison violence, but generally it is a fascinating character study....and, even for those of you who are not bird lovers, full of interesting information about our feathered friends. How they trained the birds to do some things in here also is amazing.BAD NEWS: What a disappointment to do some research about the real ""birdman,"" Robert Stroud.

Burt Lancaster does an excellent role of playing Robert Stroud, the convicted killer who was sentenced to death but who had his sentence commuted when his mother interceded with the wife of President Wilson shortly after the end of World War I. However, at the time of the commutation he had been consigned to solitary confinement until he could be executed. Because the commutation of the sentence to life imprisonment said nothing about the solitary confinement issue, Warden Shoemaker (Karl Malden) interpreted the commutation to mean that Stroud should remain in solitary confinement, which he did for the remaining years of his life.While still at Leavenworth Stroud adopted a sparrow that had flown into his cell. As time went on he ordered other birds. When the birds started dying due to an infectious disease, Stroud began reading about bird diseases. He ordered various chemicals and, after experimenting with different doses (some of which were lethal), he was finally able to stop the infection and his remaining birds survived. With so much time on his hands, Stroud became an expert on bird diseases and their cures and published highly respected articles and books on the subject. Despite this, he was eventually forbidden from keeping birds in his cell.Later he was transferred to Alcatraz (and reconnected with his nemesis, Warden Shoemaker, who in the meantime had become the warden of this island prison). While there, he continued his studies and taught himself several language.""Birdman of Alcatraz"" is an extremely sympathetic portrayal of Stroud and other than at the beginning of the movie (where it is clear that he has an extreme anger problem) does not focus on the ongoing negatives in his personality. (It is generally acknowledged that he remained an extremely difficult person to deal with.) However, the somewhat one-sided portrayal does not detract from the overall value of this movie, both as a commentary on our prison system (Is the purpose of incarceration primarily punishment or to rehabilitate the prisoner?) and for the excellent acting throughout. Lancaster and Malden both give stellar performances.",5,Great portrayal by Burt Lancaster,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,2275,"['have', 'watched', 'Birdman', 'Alcatraz', 'several', 'times', 'first', 'saw', '1960s', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'excellent', 'role', 'playing', 'Robert', 'Stroud', 'convicted', 'killer', 'who', 'was', 'sentenced', 'death', 'who', 'had', 'sentence', 'commuted', 'when', 'mother', 'interceded', 'wife', 'President', 'Wilson', 'shortly', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'However', 'time', 'commutation', 'had', 'been', 'consigned', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'could', 'be', 'executed', 'commutation', 'sentence', 'life', 'imprisonment', 'said', 'nothing', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'issue', 'Warden', 'Shoemaker', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'interpreted', 'commutation', 'mean', 'Stroud', 'should', 'remain', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'did', 'remaining', 'years', 'life.While', 'still', 'Leavenworth', 'Stroud', 'adopted', 'sparrow', 'had', 'flown', 'cell', 'time', 'went', 'ordered', 'other', 'birds', 'When', 'birds', 'started', 'dying', 'due', 'infectious', 'disease', 'Stroud', 'began', 'reading', 'bird', 'diseases', 'ordered', 'various', 'chemicals', 'experimenting', 'different', 'doses', 'were', 'lethal', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'stop', 'infection', 'remaining', 'birds', 'survived', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'Stroud', 'became', 'expert', 'bird', 'diseases', 'cures', 'published', 'highly', 'respected', 'articles', 'books', 'subject', 'was', 'eventually', 'forbidden', 'keeping', 'birds', 'cell.Later', 'was', 'transferred', 'Alcatraz', 'reconnected', 'nemesis', 'Warden', 'Shoemaker', 'who', 'meantime', 'had', 'become', 'warden', 'island', 'prison', 'there', 'continued', 'studies', 'taught', 'several', 'language', 'Birdman', 'Alcatraz', 'extremely', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'Stroud', 'other', 'beginning', 'movie', 'where', 'clear', 'extreme', 'anger', 'problem', 'not', 'focus', 'ongoing', 'negatives', 'personality', 'generally', 'acknowledged', 'remained', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'person', 'deal', 'However', 'somewhat', 'one-sided', 'portrayal', 'not', 'detract', 'overall', 'value', 'movie', 'commentary', 'prison', 'system', 'purpose', 'incarceration', 'primarily', 'punishment', 'rehabilitate', 'prisoner', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Lancaster', 'Malden', 'give', 'stellar', 'performances']",Birdman of Alcatraz VHS

With only a third-grade education, he eventually educates himself, while in prison, to become the world's foremost expert on bird diseases.  He began by befriending a little baby sparrow he found, raising it, and training it, in his prison cell.  Then the other prisoners began getting canaries, adn getting advice from the Bird Man.  At a certain point, the birds began to die of a virus.  This began the Bird Man's education, trying to find out why.  He eventually did scientific research in his cell, and found cures for a number of bird diseases.  This was especially helpful to the development of the poultry industry.  He wrote two books while in prison, one on the diseases of birds (and cures), and the other on prison, and how prison affects the character of prisoners.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes drama, true stories, emotionally-moving stories, or who is interested in either animals, science, or prison life.",5,He Made an Incredible Contribution to Humanity,1094169600,"09 3, 2004",2004,1370,"['had', 'heard', 'name', 'only', 'Bird', 'Man', 'Alcatraz', 'knew', 'nothing', 'else', 'even', 'who', 'was', 'seeing', 'film.Burt', 'Lancaster', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'film', 'right', 'up', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'movies', 'are', 'high', 'drama', 'intriguing', 'stories.The', 'Bird', 'Man', 'Alcatraz', 'true', 'story', 'man', 'prison', 'murder', 'killed', 'man', 'who', 'insulted', 'prostitute', 'friend', 'only', 'third-grade', 'education', 'eventually', 'prison', 'become', 'world', 'foremost', 'expert', 'bird', 'diseases', 'began', 'befriending', 'little', 'baby', 'sparrow', 'found', 'raising', 'training', 'prison', 'cell', 'Then', 'other', 'prisoners', 'began', 'getting', 'canaries', 'getting', 'advice', 'Bird', 'Man', 'certain', 'point', 'birds', 'began', 'die', 'virus', 'began', 'Bird', 'Man', 'education', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'eventually', 'did', 'scientific', 'research', 'cell', 'found', 'cures', 'number', 'bird', 'diseases', 'was', 'especially', 'helpful', 'development', 'poultry', 'industry', 'wrote', 'two', 'books', 'prison', 'one', 'diseases', 'birds', 'cures', 'other', 'prison', 'how', 'prison', 'character', 'prisoners.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'drama', 'true', 'stories', 'emotionally-moving', 'stories', 'who', 'interested', 'animals', 'science', 'prison', 'life']",Birdman of Alcatraz VHS

The movie presents Stroud in a pretty benevolent light, although in reality he was apparently very strange and disliked by most others.Originally banned from having nearly any kind of activity as a hobby, Stroud eventually begins to raise sparrows and other birds while imprisoned in Leavenworth prison (he never had any at Alcatraz). Although Stroud only had a few years of grade school education, he teaches himself several languages and many sciences while in prison. As a result of making ""home remedies"" to treat his birds when they begin to die off, he eventually writes some well-regarded books on bird diseases and their treatment.The black-and-white movie was released while Stroud was still alive in 1962 but he never saw it. He died of natural causes on November 21, 1963, just one day before president Kennedy was assassinated, and his death went largely unnoticed.Co-starring Karl Malden as the warden, Neville Brand as a guard, and Telly Savalas (oscar nominated) as a fellow immate, it was well-acted through out.

And a year ago I visited the island for the first time.This is definitely a high-quality film, with a mixture of fact and artistic license. The rangers at Alcatraz still put emphasis on the dark side of Robert Stroud,and the role played by Burt Lancaster succeeds in offsetting this to a great extent.Reviewer &quot;silentscott&quot; points out that the rangers have been promoting the idea that the movie says that Stroud had all his birds at Alcatraz, while the fact is that they were at Leavenworth. I got the same impression in my own tour. But actually the movie makes it very clear that the birds were left behind at Leavenworth (fate unstated), and that he had none at Alcatraz.  Maybe it's time for the otherwise capable guides on the island to review the film again and see where it does diverge from the truth.I was a young adult when the movie came out in 1962. Although I didn't get to see it until this past week (July 2004), I still remember the haunting Elmer Bernstein theme song that I would hear on the radio in the early 1960s. I now have that song in my own collection. But I am puzzled that while I watched that movie I did not hear any of the melody that was played on the air.

402144,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,6304111363,magellan,"[3, 5]","As someone noted previously, this role was unusual for Lancaster in that it required him to project a thoughtful, quiet intensity and and a more introverted personality, rather than the extroverted, flamboyant personalities he tended to portray before in such movies as Elmer Gantry or From Here to Eternity. Playing a convict rather than a handsome leading man, Lancaster never did anything like it before or since. Telly Savalas also turns in a notable performance many years before his well known TV series Kojak debuted. Playing a fictionalized warden character, Malden also turns in an excellent performance.Robert Stroud eventually became famous for researching and writing on bird diseases. I once looked up his book in a college library, and read some of it to see what it was like, since I was a physiology major and interested in medicine. Interestingly enough, the edition I found had included with the text many of the letters Stroud received commenting on his book, along with his replies. Many of the letters were from academic veterinarians who had questions, criticisms, or comments on the book, and it was interesting to see Stroud's responses. He came across as intelligent and thoughtful, although a bit piqued at times, pointing out that he never had the advantages of a college education, compared to the professionals who were critiquing his research.Much of the movie is devoted to the story of Stroud's famous research and his book, and the sensation it created among the public. The idea of a convicted murderer who spent most of his time in solitary becoming a published author and respected scientist was certainly sensational.How it all got started was innocent enough. Since Stroud spent so much of his prison career in isolation, he's allowed to keep a few canaries, which eventually leads to his famous discovery, when he wins a research contest to find a cure for septic fever, a common killer of birds. He eventually goes on to invent remedies for several other avian illnesses and conditions. Considering that Stroud only had a third grade education, his research and the resulting book is certainly a remarkable achievement.Stroud actually wrote four books while he was in prison. He wrote two books on birds, The Diseases of Canaries and Stroud's Digest on the Diseases of Birds. After being transferred to Alcatraz, he wrote an autobiography, Bobbye, and A History of the U.S. Prison System from Colonial Times to the Formation of the Bureau of Prisons.This is an interesting passage from the Wikipedia article on Stroud:""According to those who knew Stroud while he was in prison, the mild-mannered characterization of him, as presented in Gaddis's book and the subsequent film was largely fiction. In Full Circle with Michael Palin, one of his fellow prisoners said, ""He was a jerk. He was a guy that thrived on chaos, turmoil, upheaval. He liked other people to be involved in these kind of things, but he was never a participant.""Coincidentally, my sister once lived in the apartment complex in Alaska where Stroud committed his first murder. Overall, this is one of director Frankenheimer's and Lancaster's most remarkable movies, and still worth seeing today despite much of it being a fictionalized account of Stroud's life.",5,Exceptional,1197331200,"12 11, 2007",2007,3267,"['someone', 'noted', 'previously', 'role', 'was', 'unusual', 'Lancaster', 'required', 'project', 'thoughtful', 'quiet', 'intensity', 'more', 'introverted', 'personality', 'rather', 'extroverted', 'flamboyant', 'personalities', 'tended', 'portray', 'such', 'movies', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'Playing', 'convict', 'rather', 'handsome', 'leading', 'man', 'Lancaster', 'never', 'did', 'anything', 'Telly', 'Savalas', 'also', 'notable', 'performance', 'many', 'years', 'well', 'known', 'TV', 'series', 'Kojak', 'debuted', 'Playing', 'fictionalized', 'warden', 'character', 'Malden', 'also', 'excellent', 'performance.Robert', 'Stroud', 'eventually', 'became', 'famous', 'researching', 'writing', 'bird', 'diseases', 'once', 'looked', 'up', 'book', 'college', 'library', 'read', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'physiology', 'major', 'interested', 'medicine', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'edition', 'found', 'had', 'included', 'text', 'many', 'letters', 'Stroud', 'received', 'commenting', 'book', 'replies', 'Many', 'letters', 'were', 'academic', 'veterinarians', 'who', 'had', 'questions', 'criticisms', 'comments', 'book', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'Stroud', 'responses', 'came', 'intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'bit', 'piqued', 'times', 'pointing', 'out', 'never', 'had', 'advantages', 'college', 'education', 'compared', 'professionals', 'who', 'were', 'critiquing', 'research.Much', 'movie', 'devoted', 'story', 'Stroud', 'famous', 'research', 'book', 'sensation', 'created', 'public', 'idea', 'convicted', 'murderer', 'who', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'solitary', 'becoming', 'published', 'author', 'respected', 'scientist', 'was', 'certainly', 'got', 'started', 'was', 'innocent', 'enough', 'Stroud', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'prison', 'career', 'isolation', 'allowed', 'keep', 'few', 'canaries', 'eventually', 'famous', 'discovery', 'when', 'research', 'contest', 'find', 'cure', 'septic', 'fever', 'common', 'killer', 'birds', 'eventually', 'invent', 'remedies', 'several', 'other', 'avian', 'illnesses', 'conditions', 'Considering', 'Stroud', 'only', 'had', 'third', 'grade', 'education', 'research', 'resulting', 'book', 'certainly', 'remarkable', 'achievement.Stroud', 'actually', 'wrote', 'four', 'books', 'was', 'prison', 'wrote', 'two', 'books', 'birds', 'Diseases', 'Canaries', 'Stroud', 'Digest', 'Diseases', 'Birds', 'being', 'transferred', 'Alcatraz', 'wrote', 'autobiography', 'Bobbye', 'A', 'History', 'U.S.', 'Prison', 'System', 'Colonial', 'Times', 'Formation', 'Bureau', 'Prisons.This', 'interesting', 'passage', 'Wikipedia', 'article', 'Stroud', 'According', 'who', 'knew', 'Stroud', 'was', 'prison', 'mild-mannered', 'characterization', 'presented', 'Gaddis', 'book', 'subsequent', 'film', 'was', 'largely', 'fiction', 'Full', 'Circle', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'one', 'fellow', 'prisoners', 'said', 'was', 'jerk', 'was', 'guy', 'thrived', 'chaos', 'turmoil', 'upheaval', 'liked', 'other', 'people', 'be', 'involved', 'kind', 'things', 'was', 'never', 'participant', 'Coincidentally', 'sister', 'once', 'lived', 'apartment', 'complex', 'Alaska', 'where', 'Stroud', 'committed', 'first', 'murder', 'Overall', 'one', 'director', 'Frankenheimer', 'Lancaster', 'most', 'remarkable', 'movies', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'today', 'much', 'being', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'Stroud', 'life']",Birdman of Alcatraz VHS

Deming ""Backyard Trees""","[6, 6]","This classic B&W; film, one of nearly 80 flicks made by the ever-versatile Lancaster (1913-94), bears the sober and important distinction of NOT being true-to-life, to the real Robert ""Birdman"" Stroud, who was a vicious and dangerous man who deserved to die in prison. Nevermind. It's an inspirational story that shows the potential for a human being to evolve and maintain his integrity under dreadful circumstances.Since 1962 when the film was made, our prison system hasn't changed one iota. Rehabilitation is a matter of luck, not public policy, with recidivism rates climbing. Viewed as a social document of the sixties, it parallels the terrible Attica riots, and shows the corruptibility of everyone, a microcosm of life. Stroud's place as a genius in the avian world is the most exciting facet of the movie. He enters prison as a defiant young killer with no manners or humility who develops himself through his self-taught absorption into the biology of the caged bird. Through his love of birds, he comes to love himself and fellow man, and in his characteristically flat tones speaks to one of the birds he sets free, ""Take a bite out of the stars for me.""Because of his truly homicidal nature, Robert Stroud himself could never be set free, but was allowed later in life to roam among the meadows of a locked facility until his death. Superb love angle with his wife, whom he insisted on setting free, and the contrast against his own jealous mother, whose motives he finally began to understand.

The movie addresses the serious problem of prison reform in the 1960's using a hard hitting liberal right-winged Democratic style.  Excellent performances by Burt Lancaster and Telly Savalas. The film is smooth paced and is touchy at times. By the end you acually feel sorry for Robert Strout(who really isn't as &quot;nice&quot; as the movie dipicts him). The movie is truly a classic ,but it is a rememberance that Hollywood has the power to change your perspective on a person or event that happend in reality and make you think that this was the real thing. That is why each time you see based on a true story or based on this person I can garentee that Hollywood will &quot;tinker&quot; with it for its own hidden agenda, which in this case was to call attention to prision reform needed in the 1960's.

402157,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,6304111363,William Hare,"[19, 20]","Burt Lancaster won an Academy Award nomination and could easily have corralled another Oscar statuette to go with the one he secured two years earlier for his excellent effort in ""Elmer Gantry"" as he portrayed convicted killer Robert Stroud in ""Birdman of Alcatraz.""  This was also a peak period for the film's director, John Frankenheimer, since in a five-year period beginning with this triumph he also scored big with ""Seven Days in May,"" which also starred Lancaster, along with ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Seconds.""Stroud is depicted as a mamma's boy gone wrong who will not allow any fellow Leavenworth Penitentiary fellow inmates to look at his mother's picture or mention her name.  He is sent to Leavenworth for killing a man in Alaska after the victim had beaten up a prostitute friend of Stroud's.  The convict is then sent a hair's breath from the hangman's rope after he kills a prison guard in a rage.  The explosion occurs after he has been told he would not be allowed to see his mother, who has journeyed from Alaska to Kansas to visit him.Thelma Ritter, in a performance for which she received a Best Supporting Actress Academy nomination, battles zealously for her convict son throughout, and when he is sentenced to death she journeys to Washington, D.C. and obtains an appointment with First Lady Edith Wilson.  President Wilson commutes Lancaster's sentence to life shortly before the execution is scheduled to occur.  The result, however, is that the prisoner will spend the rest of his life in solitary confinement as a result of his hair trigger temper and homicidal propensities.Lancaster verbally spars for the entire picture with his nemesis, prison warden Karl Malden, although they do achieve something of an understanding by film's end.  Lancaster ultimately develops a world of his own in taking care of birds.  A man of high intellect, he becomes one of the world's leading experts on bird diseases, and eventually is able to supply Malden with advice on his arthritic right arm.The character arc revealed in the film is Lancaster losing his formidable shoulder chips and intense rage when he develops a fondness for birds that germinates into a full-fledged profession behind bars.  He even launches a business with pet shop owner Betty Field, who marries him as well.  Lancaster also develops an association with fellow solitary confinement prisoner Telly Savalas, who earned an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category.Ultimately Lancaster is transferred from Leavenworth to Alcatraz, the island-based high security federal prison near San Francisco.  He is reunited with Malden, who is now warden there.  While crushed that his move west compels him to give up his birds, Lancaster continues to read and supply advice concerning birds and humans.  At one point he serves as peacemaker during the notorious Alcatraz prison riot.  He also gets a chance to meet the man who has written a bestselling book on his life, played by Edmond O'Brien, who also serves as the film's narrator.It is during his Alcatraz period that Lancaster becomes involved in preaching prison reform.  When Malden sees the manuscript that Lancaster is writing critiquing the prison system he becomes initially insulted and enraged, then, after reflection, begins to see the validity of points being raised.  Malden, tired after years as a warden in the prison system, dies shortly thereafter.In addition to the earlier mentioned Oscar nominations for ""Birdman of Alcatraz,"" Frankenheimer was also honored in the directing category, as was Burnett Guffey in the Cinematography grouping.  Lancaster secured a major international honor by being named Best Foreign Actor for 1962 by the British Film Academy for ""Birdman of Alcatraz.""While controversy continues to abide over whether Robert Stroud was realistically depicted in the film and mellowed to the degree demonstrated on screen, it is undeniable that ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" made excellent points in the dramatic category as well as in the ongoing discussion of how to deal with prisoners in the ongoing pursuit of helping them adapt to life both inside and outside institution walls.Guy Troper wrote the script and Elmer Bernstein provided the musical score.  The film's chief producer was Lancaster partner Harold Hecht.",5,"A Critique of Penal System, Great Human Drama",1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,4302,"['Burt', 'Lancaster', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'corralled', 'Oscar', 'statuette', 'go', 'one', 'secured', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'excellent', 'effort', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'portrayed', 'convicted', 'killer', 'Robert', 'Stroud', 'Birdman', 'Alcatraz', 'was', 'also', 'peak', 'period', 'film', 'director', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'five-year', 'period', 'beginning', 'triumph', 'also', 'scored', 'big', 'Seven', 'Days', 'May', 'also', 'starred', 'Lancaster', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'Seconds', 'Stroud', 'depicted', 'mamma', 'boy', 'gone', 'wrong', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'fellow', 'Leavenworth', 'Penitentiary', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'look', 'mother', 'picture', 'mention', 'name', 'sent', 'Leavenworth', 'killing', 'man', 'Alaska', 'victim', 'had', 'beaten', 'up', 'prostitute', 'friend', 'Stroud', 'convict', 'then', 'sent', 'hair', 'breath', 'hangman', 'rope', 'prison', 'guard', 'rage', 'explosion', 'been', 'told', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'see', 'mother', 'who', 'journeyed', 'Alaska', 'Kansas', 'visit', 'him.Thelma', 'Ritter', 'performance', 'received', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'nomination', 'zealously', 'convict', 'son', 'when', 'sentenced', 'death', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'appointment', 'First', 'Lady', 'Edith', 'Wilson', 'President', 'Wilson', 'Lancaster', 'sentence', 'life', 'shortly', 'execution', 'scheduled', 'occur', 'result', 'however', 'prisoner', 'will', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'result', 'hair', 'trigger', 'temper', 'homicidal', 'propensities.Lancaster', 'verbally', 'entire', 'picture', 'nemesis', 'prison', 'warden', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'do', 'achieve', 'something', 'understanding', 'film', 'end', 'Lancaster', 'ultimately', 'world', 'own', 'taking', 'care', 'birds', 'man', 'high', 'intellect', 'one', 'world', 'leading', 'experts', 'bird', 'diseases', 'eventually', 'able', 'supply', 'Malden', 'advice', 'arthritic', 'right', 'arm.The', 'character', 'arc', 'revealed', 'film', 'Lancaster', 'losing', 'formidable', 'shoulder', 'chips', 'intense', 'rage', 'when', 'fondness', 'birds', 'full-fledged', 'profession', 'bars', 'even', 'business', 'pet', 'shop', 'owner', 'Betty', 'Field', 'who', 'as', 'well', 'Lancaster', 'also', 'association', 'fellow', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'prisoner', 'Telly', 'Savalas', 'who', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'category.Ultimately', 'Lancaster', 'transferred', 'Leavenworth', 'Alcatraz', 'island-based', 'high', 'security', 'federal', 'prison', 'San', 'Francisco', 'reunited', 'Malden', 'who', 'now', 'warden', 'there', 'crushed', 'move', 'west', 'compels', 'give', 'up', 'birds', 'Lancaster', 'read', 'supply', 'advice', 'concerning', 'birds', 'humans', 'one', 'point', 'peacemaker', 'notorious', 'Alcatraz', 'prison', 'riot', 'also', 'chance', 'meet', 'man', 'who', 'written', 'bestselling', 'book', 'life', 'played', 'Edmond', ""O'Brien"", 'who', 'also', 'film', 'narrator.It', 'Alcatraz', 'period', 'Lancaster', 'involved', 'preaching', 'prison', 'reform', 'When', 'Malden', 'manuscript', 'Lancaster', 'writing', 'critiquing', 'prison', 'system', 'initially', 'insulted', 'enraged', 'then', 'reflection', 'see', 'validity', 'points', 'being', 'raised', 'Malden', 'tired', 'years', 'warden', 'prison', 'system', 'shortly', 'thereafter.In', 'addition', 'earlier', 'mentioned', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Birdman', 'Alcatraz', 'Frankenheimer', 'was', 'also', 'honored', 'directing', 'category', 'was', 'Burnett', 'Guffey', 'Cinematography', 'grouping', 'Lancaster', 'secured', 'major', 'international', 'honor', 'being', 'named', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Actor', '1962', 'British', 'Film', 'Academy', 'Birdman', 'Alcatraz', 'controversy', 'abide', 'Robert', 'Stroud', 'was', 'realistically', 'depicted', 'film', 'mellowed', 'degree', 'demonstrated', 'screen', 'undeniable', 'Birdman', 'Alcatraz', 'made', 'excellent', 'points', 'dramatic', 'category', 'as', 'well', 'ongoing', 'discussion', 'how', 'deal', 'prisoners', 'ongoing', 'pursuit', 'helping', 'adapt', 'life', 'outside', 'institution', 'walls.Guy', 'Troper', 'wrote', 'script', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'provided', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'chief', 'producer', 'was', 'Lancaster', 'partner', 'Harold', 'Hecht']",Birdman of Alcatraz VHS
