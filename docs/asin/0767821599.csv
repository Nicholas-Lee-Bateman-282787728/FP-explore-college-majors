16278,A1SIAC1Q9Z3KK4,0767821599,,"[0, 1]","This movie needed about 20-30 minutes more film, a better director, and a better actor to play the kid before it could be good.  I read the stephen  kind novella and i liked it alot, but naturally this movie only carries the  very basic plot that the novella did.  The first time i saw it i missed the  first 20 minutes and i thought it was pretty good, but when i finally saw  those first 20 minutes i then knew why all the critics hated this movie.  The relationship between the boy and the old nazi is never really given  time to grow.  the movie basically has the kid come in, blackmail the nazi,  and BANG they're inseperable all through the rest of the movie.  No time is  given for the relationship to develope by itself.  Now dont get me wrong,  there are alot of good scenes in this film, but then again theres alot more  bad ones.  I'm pretty dissapointed in it because it could have been a  really great film if it wasnt blundered so much.  Ian McKellen is  spectacular of course, i dont think that theres anyway he can be bad in a  movie.  The actor who plays the kid should go back to doing after school  specials or something because he just dosnt cut it.  The director is never  really sure exactly what he is trying to tell us.  When i read the novella  the only person i thought could direct this would have been stanley  kubrick, now that would have made one heck of a movie.  All in all there is  some great material to work with in this film, maybe one day somebody will  remake the movie into a better version.",3,Missing alot,967680000,"08 31, 2000",2000,1531,"['movie', 'needed', '20-30', 'minutes', 'more', 'film', 'better', 'director', 'better', 'actor', 'play', 'kid', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'read', 'stephen', 'kind', 'novella', 'i', 'liked', 'alot', 'naturally', 'movie', 'only', 'very', 'basic', 'plot', 'novella', 'did', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'saw', 'i', 'missed', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'when', 'i', 'finally', 'saw', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'i', 'then', 'knew', 'why', 'critics', 'hated', 'movie', 'relationship', 'boy', 'old', 'nazi', 'never', 'really', 'given', 'time', 'grow', 'movie', 'basically', 'kid', 'come', 'blackmail', 'nazi', 'BANG', ""'re"", 'inseperable', 'rest', 'movie', 'time', 'given', 'relationship', 'develope', 'Now', 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'alot', 'good', 'scenes', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'alot', 'more', 'bad', 'ones', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'dissapointed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'blundered', 'so', 'much', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'spectacular', 'course', 'i', 'dont', 'think', 'anyway', 'can', 'be', 'bad', 'movie', 'actor', 'who', 'kid', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'doing', 'school', 'specials', 'something', 'just', 'dosnt', 'cut', 'director', 'never', 'really', 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'trying', 'tell', 'When', 'i', 'read', 'novella', 'only', 'person', 'i', 'thought', 'could', 'direct', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stanley', 'kubrick', 'now', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'heck', 'movie', 'great', 'material', 'work', 'film', 'maybe', 'one', 'day', 'somebody', 'will', 'remake', 'movie', 'better', 'version']",N/A

In doing so, a chain reaction is formed, resulting in a whole town being capsized.  In Apt Pupil, Todd Bowden, played by Brad Renfro, is the boy who becomes so obsessed with the Holocaust to a point that he needs to know more about it than the school will provide. He wants to know the details that no textbook would dare print. Todd Bowden wants to know how it feels to kill someone. He thirsts for all the hideous facts about the genocide that took place during the Second World War. Bowden is remarkably bright. He has kept tabs on his suspicious next door neighbor, Arthur Denker (Ian McKellen), and as it turns out, Arthur Denker is actually runaway Nazi general Kurt Dussander. Dussander is blackmailed by Bowden to tell him everything that he had ever wanted to know about the near extermination of an entire human race. All of the fear-inspiring information commences to get to Todd's head leaving him awake throughout each night. Soon, he becomes transformed into a loathing human being, ignoring his best friend, lying to his parents and teachers, and killing crippled pigeons. The plot builds up, and on several occasions, it seems like the movie is about to end, but instead, it goes on more dramatic than ever.  The acting by Brad Renfro and Ian McKellen is astounding. The two of them take on their roles perfectly, and go deep into their characters, which is distinctly evident in the movie. They take histrionics to a new level. The one scene that is exceptionally captivating is where Bowden forces Dussander to dress up in a Nazi uniform he gets from some costume shop and orders him to march in place. The former Nazi general at first does not take the boy seriously as he playfully walks in place. Then as Todd yells at him more and more, and Dussander begins to lose himself in the continuous commands, he becomes increasingly involved in the act. Within a few minutes, he is dynamically marching. The steps grow more violent and more intense with each word that Todd exclaims. Todd becomes frightened by the man, and demands that he stop. Dussander continues as if Todd had not spoken. Repeating himself numerous times, Todd ends up yelling for him to halt. The general regains his consciousness, and from then on remains as abhorrent as he once was in his younger days in the war.  Apt Pupil is a suspenseful psychological thriller that truly succeeds in winning over the audience. The movie in general is very well executed with a disturbing yet outstandingly canny plot created by the master of horror, Stephen King.Surprisingly mild in gore, Stephen King's Apt Pupil, directed by Bryan Singer, also starring David Schwimmer, is entitled to a very apt B+.",4,The Evil Within,972000000,"10 20, 2000",2000,2833,"['Apt', 'Pupil', 'rated', 'R', '1', 'hour', '40', 'minutesThe', 'malevolence', 'hidden', 'inside', 'one', 'man', 'so', 'powerful', 'can', 'lash', 'out', 'young', 'boy', 'possess', 'as', 'well', 'doing', 'so', 'chain', 'reaction', 'formed', 'resulting', 'whole', 'town', 'being', 'capsized', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'Todd', 'Bowden', 'played', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'boy', 'who', 'so', 'obsessed', 'Holocaust', 'point', 'know', 'more', 'school', 'will', 'provide', 'know', 'details', 'textbook', 'would', 'dare', 'print', 'Todd', 'Bowden', 'know', 'how', 'kill', 'someone', 'hideous', 'facts', 'genocide', 'took', 'place', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Bowden', 'remarkably', 'bright', 'kept', 'tabs', 'suspicious', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Arthur', 'Denker', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'out', 'Arthur', 'Denker', 'actually', 'runaway', 'Nazi', 'general', 'Kurt', 'Dussander', 'Dussander', 'blackmailed', 'Bowden', 'tell', 'everything', 'had', 'ever', 'wanted', 'know', 'near', 'extermination', 'entire', 'human', 'race', 'fear-inspiring', 'information', 'commences', 'get', 'Todd', 'head', 'leaving', 'awake', 'night', 'Soon', 'transformed', 'loathing', 'human', 'being', 'ignoring', 'best', 'friend', 'lying', 'parents', 'teachers', 'killing', 'crippled', 'pigeons', 'plot', 'up', 'several', 'occasions', 'movie', 'end', 'instead', 'more', 'dramatic', 'ever', 'acting', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'astounding', 'two', 'take', 'roles', 'perfectly', 'go', 'deep', 'characters', 'distinctly', 'evident', 'movie', 'take', 'histrionics', 'new', 'level', 'one', 'scene', 'exceptionally', 'captivating', 'where', 'Bowden', 'forces', 'Dussander', 'dress', 'up', 'Nazi', 'uniform', 'costume', 'shop', 'orders', 'march', 'place', 'former', 'Nazi', 'general', 'first', 'not', 'take', 'boy', 'seriously', 'playfully', 'place', 'Then', 'Todd', 'yells', 'more', 'more', 'Dussander', 'lose', 'continuous', 'commands', 'increasingly', 'involved', 'act', 'few', 'minutes', 'dynamically', 'marching', 'steps', 'grow', 'more', 'violent', 'more', 'intense', 'word', 'Todd', 'Todd', 'becomes', 'frightened', 'man', 'stop', 'Dussander', 'Todd', 'had', 'not', 'spoken', 'Repeating', 'numerous', 'times', 'Todd', 'up', 'yelling', 'halt', 'general', 'consciousness', 'then', 'remains', 'as', 'abhorrent', 'once', 'was', 'younger', 'days', 'war', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'suspenseful', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'truly', 'winning', 'audience', 'movie', 'general', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'disturbing', 'yet', 'outstandingly', 'canny', 'plot', 'created', 'master', 'horror', 'Stephen', 'King.Surprisingly', 'mild', 'gore', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'directed', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'also', 'starring', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'entitled', 'very', 'apt', 'B+']",N/A

The main fault does lie in the story with not knowing what the pupil's motivation or cause is for becoming evil.He goes from an intelligent,above average American high school kid to a sinister one with a large appetite and curiosity for human and animal atrocities.As for one reviewer who was not happy the way the film trivialized the Holocaust,no matter how horrendous that time period is for humanity,viewers need to keep in mind that the center of the film is the twisted relationship between the student and the ex-Nazi criminal; How the student declines into a cold blooded menacing individual.I never read the actual King novella from which this is based on.Therefore, I cannot be judgemental or compare and contrast.Almost anything by Stephen King is usually entertaining if not suspenseful !Excellent casting for this film. The only questionable presence is that of David Schwimmer's guidance counselor role; It felt like he was still playing Ross from Friends with a wig and mustache. He seemed to be pretty inept...Apt Pupil is more of a &quot;good&quot; rent on vhs instead of shelling out the bucks for the dvd version to add to anyone's personal library.This film rates 3 stars for not providing any kind of insight to the Apt Pupil's drive or fascination with evil.He's definitely not insane and is highly intelligent.However, intelligence, sanity (or lack of) and what really lies in the human heart and soul are very different things altogether...",3,An In-Between-Kinda- thriller...,976838400,"12 15, 2000",2000,1587,"['Wow', 'reading', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'film', 'finally', 'seeing', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'viewers', 'are', 'split', 'practically', '50/50', 'main', 'fault', 'lie', 'story', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'pupil', 'motivation', 'cause', 'becoming', 'evil.He', 'intelligent', 'above', 'average', 'American', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'sinister', 'one', 'large', 'appetite', 'curiosity', 'human', 'animal', 'atrocities.As', 'one', 'reviewer', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'way', 'film', 'trivialized', 'Holocaust', 'matter', 'how', 'horrendous', 'time', 'period', 'humanity', 'viewers', 'need', 'keep', 'mind', 'center', 'film', 'twisted', 'relationship', 'student', 'ex-Nazi', 'criminal', 'student', 'cold', 'blooded', 'menacing', 'individual.I', 'never', 'read', 'actual', 'King', 'novella', 'based', 'on.Therefore', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'judgemental', 'compare', 'contrast.Almost', 'anything', 'Stephen', 'King', 'usually', 'entertaining', 'not', 'suspenseful', 'Excellent', 'casting', 'film', 'only', 'questionable', 'presence', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'role', 'felt', 'was', 'still', 'playing', 'Ross', 'Friends', 'wig', 'mustache', 'seemed', 'be', 'pretty', 'inept', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'more', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'rent', 'vhs', 'instead', 'shelling', 'out', 'bucks', 'dvd', 'version', 'add', 'anyone', 'personal', 'library.This', 'film', 'rates', '3', 'stars', 'not', 'providing', 'kind', 'insight', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'drive', 'fascination', 'evil.He', 'definitely', 'not', 'insane', 'highly', 'intelligent.However', 'intelligence', 'sanity', 'lack', 'what', 'really', 'human', 'heart', 'soul', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'things', 'altogether']",N/A

The teenager, Todd, (played by Brad Renfro) at first has the older man where he wants him and humiliates the Nazi Kurt Dussander (played masterfully by Sir Ian McKellan) and forces him to give him graphic accounts of his crimes, always hanging the evidence he has against him as the ""sword of Damacles"" over his head.  However, through an interesting series of events, the teenager's school troubles result in a stunning reversal of fortune for Todd and he is forced by Dussander to do his bidding.  All of the while, Todd is slowly becoming like the evil Dussander whom he despises and is facinated with.  Todd's strange evolution from a pigeon killer to a cruel blackmailer and murderer is stunning.David Schwimmer also has a great role as Todd's hapless guidance counselor Ed French.  I'm a dyed-in-the-wool enemy of the TV show Friends, but Schwimmer's performance was excellent and gave me a newfound respect for him as an actor.While most alterations of books in the translation from page to screen are almost always for the worst, the film version significantly alters the ending of the book for a vastly improved effect.  The book ends in a typical Stephen King-esque gory way.  The film's conclusion is more in-line with the subtle and creepy tone of the entire book and is much better than the book's ending.The bottom line is that this is a vastly underrated movie (much like the Shawshank Redemption when it first came out in theaters) and another great adaptation coming from a Stephen King book (makes me wonder when someone is going to put out ""The Breathing Method"" on film).",5,Facinating study in evil....,1068422400,"11 10, 2003",2003,1893,"['third', 'film', 'spun', 'book', 'Stephen', 'King', 'others', 'being', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'adapted', 'skill', 'book', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer.The', 'story', 'centers', 'intrepid', 'young', 'suburbanite', 'who', 'down', 'elderly', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'neighborhood', 'teenager', 'Todd', 'played', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'first', 'older', 'man', 'where', 'Nazi', 'Kurt', 'Dussander', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'give', 'graphic', 'accounts', 'crimes', 'always', 'hanging', 'evidence', 'sword', 'Damacles', 'head', 'However', 'interesting', 'series', 'events', 'teenager', 'school', 'troubles', 'result', 'stunning', 'reversal', 'fortune', 'Todd', 'forced', 'Dussander', 'do', 'bidding', 'while', 'Todd', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'evil', 'Dussander', 'whom', 'facinated', 'Todd', 'strange', 'evolution', 'pigeon', 'killer', 'cruel', 'blackmailer', 'murderer', 'stunning.David', 'Schwimmer', 'also', 'great', 'role', 'Todd', 'hapless', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'Ed', 'French', ""'m"", 'dyed-in-the-wool', 'enemy', 'TV', 'show', 'Friends', 'Schwimmer', 'performance', 'was', 'excellent', 'gave', 'newfound', 'respect', 'actor.While', 'most', 'alterations', 'books', 'translation', 'page', 'screen', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'worst', 'film', 'version', 'significantly', 'ending', 'book', 'vastly', 'improved', 'effect', 'book', 'typical', 'Stephen', 'King-esque', 'gory', 'way', 'film', 'conclusion', 'more', 'in-line', 'subtle', 'creepy', 'tone', 'entire', 'book', 'much', 'better', 'book', 'ending.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'movie', 'much', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'great', 'adaptation', 'coming', 'Stephen', 'King', 'book', 'wonder', 'when', 'someone', 'going', 'put', 'out', 'Breathing', 'Method', 'film']",N/A

I always thought that the story APT PUPIL was about fifty pages too long. The film version takes care of this concern, distilling PUPIL down to it's basic elements: old evil passing itself on to a young, all too eager student. Ian McKellen (yep, Gandolf himself!) is perfectly, quietly malevolent as the ancient nazi war criminal, hiding out in suburbia. Brad Renfro plays Todd Bowden, the normal-looking high school kid, concealing a darkness that appears to be insatiable and without limits. Todd fools his family, friends, and guidance counselor (David Schwimmer), into believing he is just another highly gifted teenager. In reality, he is a sociopathic wretch, coasting along by gaining the misplaced trust of others. Studying the holocaust in history class brings out Todd's blackened interior, causing him to hunt down and ensnare McKellen's character. What follows is a study of twisted evil in the midst of apparent normalcy. Todd and his ""teacher"" develop a seemingly symbiotic relationship that is in actuality purely parasitic. They are destroying each others souls. APT PUPIL's horror lies in it's use of demonic evil in broad daylight. Most of the movie is played out in the sunny afternoon. Evil doesn't wait for nightfall.

Todd is also obsessed with the Holocaust. He is not Jewish but is a voyeur who is immersed in the cruelty of the Nazis to the point where it gives him a mad rush. Tom's obsession earns him an A in class and through his own detective work he comes across an ex-Nazi. He forces the man through black mail to tell him story after story about the killings. &quot;How did it feel?&quot; is his number one question.Enter into the sickened mind of a young boy who thinks he has everything under control. The ex-Nazi is old and scared but after awhile he turns the table on his young torturer. As the stories progress we see that there isn't much difference in the two as they deceive and hurt other people for the sake of their sickened minds.Adapted from Stephen King's novella, Apt Pupil, this presentation is a close up of evil and how it erodes the human spirit. Our pupil, Todd, is a willing adherent who doesn't know when to let go. As soon as he's mastered the lesson of power, Todd begins to impose his will on others. When things fall apart he absolves himself of all responsibility. The process of his transformation is fascinating and chilling. Evil is alive and well and poisons the young who are willing.

He takes after the the best kind of suspense filmmaker, drawing well-deserved comparisons to Alfred Hitchcock.  And prior to his turn directing The X-Men he looked contented making good low-budget films that don't exactly rake in the money but are impressive just the same.  This is his little scene follow-up to Suspects and is equally intense and impressive.  Without the mesmerizing diolouge and all the plot twists, he relies this time on a couple of fine actors hitting their stride at far different times in their careers.  Renfro's a teen heart-throb best known for his role in The Client though his range has expanded greatly since then and McKellen's an actor who I knew little of until he help me breathless for this film's entire two hour running time.  He plays a German fugitive wanted for crimes committed against humanity during the days of WW2, living a peaceful, quiet life until he's confronted by a young boy who demands he confess his deeeds.  Not to a judge, jury or even a priest, but to him.  His curiosity gets the best of him and he holds the Nazi war criminal against his will - forcing him to regurgitate all the information he possible could about the war, about the gas chambers, you name it.  It's a psychological thriller that builds from sceen to sceen, frame to frame until an uneventful but satisfying conclusion.  The chest thumping score by John Ottman brings a dramatic presence to moments in the film when it starts to drag it's feet.  Based on the Stephen King short story, it's one of his best adaptations and a must-see for any of his fans.

16299,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0767821599,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[20, 25]","I have always regarded Apt Pupil as one of Stephen King's greatest and most compelling pieces of fiction.  The film adaptation was a long time coming; years ago, a version starring Ricky Schroeder as Todd Bowden was stopped just as production began, and rumors and speculations about a possible movie frittered around for years-until 1998.  While this movie is not quite as powerful as King's novella and substitutes a brand new conclusion to the story, it is still an incredible exploration of evil.  Brad Renfro is effective as the disturbingly curious Todd, but it is Ian McKellen's superlative performance as Dussander/Danker that makes this movie an unforgettable psychological thriller.  I also like to pay tribute to animals who contribute their talents to films without even a mention in the credits.  There is a cat that appears in one powerful scene of this movie, conveying vivid emotions of curiosity, helplessness, and fear before delivering a truly frenzied, physically impressive, action-packed performance of high caliber indeed.Todd Bowden is an intelligent, fairly normal teenager whose interest in the Third Reich mutates into a dangerous obsession when he locates and identifies an old German war criminal living in his own neighborhood.  Confronting the old man, he convinces him to admit who he is, promising him that he will tell no one his secret as long as Dussander does one thing for him.  Todd wants to know everything about the Holocaust, what Dussander did, how he did it, how he felt, etc.  A very strange bond develops between this odd couple, each character holding information that could destroy the other's very world, each seeking to gain the upper hand; it is a power struggle between two ruthlessly cunning individuals.  As time goes on, both Dussander and Todd begin to change, affected by the evil that is their constant topic of conversation.  The tension builds up throughout the film, culminating in a very satisfying conclusion (although I still prefer King's original conclusion).This is not a horror movie so much as a movie about horror and, in particular, obsession.  There are some disturbing events in the movie, and one has to question which character is more evil than the other.  It is difficult to really like either leading character, but one is intensely interested in the final outcome that must inevitably come; true evil can be hidden only so long.  When I first learned of this movie's release, I was thrilled to finally see the story brought to life, yet the movie seemed to come and go with little fanfare.

I couldn't find it in any store and I really wanted to see it, so I took a drastic measure and ordered The Movie Channel from my cable company just because &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; was aired on it frequently.  A gifted high school student studying the holocaust from decades ago discovers what seems to be a Nazi war criminal and turns out to be just that. Ian McKellan really does look like that type of person, and his German accent is pretty convincing. The holocaust has always been an interesting thing to me; it was very sick and was outspoken everywhere, but engrossing. The entire idea of this movie is introduced smoothly. There are a few scenes of &quot;dreams&quot; where Todd(Brad Renfro) imagines being in the middle of it all. They are somewhat violent and very graphic and believable. It is the best work of Stephen King because it is an educational movie. The movie digs deep to modify the former Nazi, and it shows in several scenes, his cruelness to others that lets someone believe that he was who he was accused of being.  On the negative end, it doesn't really go that far into each subject when the holocaust is mentioned, but when it goes in-depth about a topic, it explains it very well. The only other complaint about this is that it seems difficult to believe that he could find the man that quick, although it shows him researching it. Overall, it is a very educational movie that isn't offensive much and the guy from &quot;Friends&quot; does all right and seemed serious.",4,Educationally Apt,978393600,"01 2, 2001",2001,1572,"['Finding', 'movie', 'anywhere', 'was', 'searching', 'needle', 'haystack', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'store', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'took', 'drastic', 'measure', 'ordered', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'cable', 'company', 'just', 'quot', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'quot', 'was', 'aired', 'frequently', 'A', 'gifted', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'studying', 'holocaust', 'decades', 'discovers', 'what', 'be', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'really', 'look', 'type', 'person', 'German', 'accent', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'holocaust', 'always', 'been', 'interesting', 'thing', 'was', 'very', 'sick', 'was', 'outspoken', 'everywhere', 'engrossing', 'entire', 'idea', 'movie', 'introduced', 'smoothly', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'quot', 'quot', 'where', 'Todd', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'imagines', 'being', 'middle', 'are', 'somewhat', 'violent', 'very', 'graphic', 'believable', 'best', 'work', 'Stephen', 'King', 'educational', 'movie', 'movie', 'deep', 'modify', 'former', 'Nazi', 'several', 'scenes', 'cruelness', 'others', 'someone', 'believe', 'was', 'who', 'was', 'accused', 'being', 'negative', 'end', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'far', 'subject', 'when', 'holocaust', 'mentioned', 'when', 'in-depth', 'topic', 'very', 'well', 'only', 'other', 'complaint', 'difficult', 'believe', 'could', 'find', 'man', 'quick', 'researching', 'Overall', 'very', 'educational', 'movie', ""n't"", 'offensive', 'much', 'guy', 'quot', 'Friends', 'quot', 'right', 'seemed', 'serious']",N/A
16301,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,0767821599,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[33, 38]","Once upon a time many years ago, a fictional French baroness smirked as her paramour pronounced his undying devotion to his Lady Fair: his dedication to her, his wonderment in the face of her not inconsiderable charms. His---Love.To which she replied, tartly: ""Love---I don't like the word 'Love'. I prefer the word 'Cruelty'.So do I. And so does the world, if the genocide raging through Africa is any kind of case in point. We live in a world where terrorists ram planes into skyscrapers because of grievances, and the question raised by our 'elites' is not ""how do we destroy these barbarians"", but rather a whining, sniveling ""why do hey hate us?""?Is not Cruelty, then, our due?The real question is not why the Holocaust happened, but, in the words of Max von Sydow's artist in ""Hannah and her Sisters"", why it doesn't happen more often. ""Apt Pupil"" is one of the most harrowing, horrifying, repulsive films I have ever watched.The blood doesn't flow like claret and the gore doesn't cake the walls, but a warning: ""Apt Pupil"" is not for the faint of heart.That said, Singer has an exceedingly subtle touch with distills one of Stephen King's best short stories into an engaging and particularly nasty piece of cinema that bores deep into the fundamental cruelty that feeds and nourishes human evil.Tod Bowden (played with understatement and sublime nastiness by Brad Renfro) is a high school student who discovers that an elderly German man---who might just be an infamous Nazi war criminal---is living in his quiet Southern California neighborhood. Bowden confronts his reclusive neighbor, presents evidence of his past as the notorious Gestapo officer Kurt Dussander (impeccably played by Sir Ian McKellen, in a kind of decrepit stepladder of Evil), and by degrees blackmails, coerces, and ultimately flatters the old man into telling him about his atrocities during the war.The movie that follows is a superbly paced and increasingly psycho-sexual ballet between the boy and the old Nazi, who is at once Bowden's mentor, idol, victim, and catalyst. Both Renfro and McKellen are so perfectly cast and so competent in their roles that the viewer is made uneasy by the way the two seem to feed off each other, glutting themselves with stories of past horrors---and growing stronger with the telling.Particularly awful is the scene where Bowden buys Dussander an SS costume as a 'present', and then cajoles him into dressing in it and marching. What initially begins as an embarrassed reluctance to even don the uniform turns into a manic peformance, and as Bowden demands that Dussander stop, the old man whispers ""be careful boy---you're playing with fire."" Indeed.Isn't it amazing how the grey terrible ringlets of age, the coils of venerability, fall off, boiled down to the core of a psychotic creature willing, able, and gleeful---to maim, torture, and destroy?The brilliance of ""Apt Pupil"" is in the way the film distills the essence of cruelty, particularly in two scenes. While I will not spoil the film by talking about either scene, both involve McKellen and Renfro in acts of shocking, amoral, sociopathic savagery to a wounded bird and a cat.When I watched the scenes, I had an epiphany---the source of depravities like the Holocaust, or the Stalinist purges, or the genocide in Rwanda has never been about race, or religion, or politics, or tribe---all of it stems from a dark desire by some men to inflict brutality on the weak, for no better reason than they derive pleasure from doing it.Because they can get away with it. Because they take all they can grab.This philosophy underscores ""Apt Pupil"", and is, in my opinion, the reason the film succeeds so well at painting a realistic picture of human horror. Renfro's Tod Bowden is not a young Nazi; like the killers at Columbine High School, he is a bored coward with too much time on his hands and a decidedly cruel streak.The acting is excellent throughout, with David Schwimmer (of Friends) perfectly cast as hapless Jewish high school guidance counselor, and Elias Koteas taking on yet another repulsive role as one of McKellen's vagrant victims. Like ""American Psycho"", ""Apt Pupil"" is not an exit, and the film offers no easy answers, leaving the uneasy viewer with a disturbing coda which prompts a question: is cruelty a force that can be harnessed for power?And ultimately, in an empty universe, where the voice of God is silent, why not?JSG",5,Quick Study,1129593600,"10 18, 2005",2005,4421,"['Once', 'time', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'fictional', 'French', 'baroness', 'smirked', 'paramour', 'pronounced', 'undying', 'devotion', 'Lady', 'Fair', 'dedication', 'wonderment', 'face', 'not', 'inconsiderable', 'charms', '-Love.To', 'replied', 'tartly', 'Love', '-I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'word', ""'Love"", 'prefer', 'word', 'do', 'so', 'world', 'genocide', 'raging', 'Africa', 'kind', 'case', 'point', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'terrorists', 'ram', 'planes', 'skyscrapers', 'grievances', 'question', 'raised', ""'elites"", 'not', 'how', 'do', 'destroy', 'barbarians', 'rather', 'whining', 'sniveling', 'why', 'do', 'hey', 'hate', 'not', 'Cruelty', 'then', 'due', 'real', 'question', 'not', 'why', 'Holocaust', 'happened', 'words', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'artist', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', 'why', ""n't"", 'happen', 'more', 'often', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'one', 'most', 'harrowing', 'horrifying', 'repulsive', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'watched.The', 'blood', ""n't"", 'flow', 'claret', 'gore', ""n't"", 'cake', 'walls', 'warning', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'not', 'faint', 'heart.That', 'said', 'Singer', 'exceedingly', 'subtle', 'touch', 'distills', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'best', 'short', 'stories', 'engaging', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'piece', 'cinema', 'deep', 'fundamental', 'cruelty', 'feeds', 'nourishes', 'human', 'evil.Tod', 'Bowden', 'played', 'understatement', 'sublime', 'nastiness', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'elderly', 'German', 'man', '-who', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'infamous', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', '-is', 'living', 'quiet', 'Southern', 'California', 'neighborhood', 'Bowden', 'confronts', 'reclusive', 'neighbor', 'evidence', 'past', 'notorious', 'Gestapo', 'officer', 'Kurt', 'Dussander', 'impeccably', 'played', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'kind', 'decrepit', 'stepladder', 'Evil', 'degrees', 'blackmails', 'coerces', 'ultimately', 'old', 'man', 'telling', 'atrocities', 'war.The', 'movie', 'superbly', 'paced', 'increasingly', 'psycho-sexual', 'ballet', 'boy', 'old', 'Nazi', 'who', 'once', 'Bowden', 'mentor', 'idol', 'victim', 'catalyst', 'Renfro', 'McKellen', 'are', 'so', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'so', 'competent', 'roles', 'viewer', 'made', 'uneasy', 'way', 'two', 'seem', 'feed', 'off', 'other', 'glutting', 'stories', 'past', 'horrors', '-and', 'growing', 'stronger', 'telling.Particularly', 'awful', 'scene', 'where', 'Bowden', 'Dussander', 'SS', 'costume', ""'present"", 'then', 'dressing', 'marching', 'What', 'initially', 'embarrassed', 'reluctance', 'even', 'don', 'uniform', 'manic', 'peformance', 'Bowden', 'Dussander', 'stop', 'old', 'man', 'be', 'careful', 'boy', '-you', ""'re"", 'playing', 'fire', 'Indeed.Is', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'how', 'grey', 'terrible', 'ringlets', 'age', 'coils', 'venerability', 'fall', 'off', 'boiled', 'down', 'core', 'psychotic', 'creature', 'willing', 'able', 'gleeful', '-to', 'maim', 'torture', 'destroy', 'brilliance', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'way', 'film', 'essence', 'cruelty', 'particularly', 'two', 'scenes', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'film', 'talking', 'scene', 'involve', 'McKellen', 'Renfro', 'acts', 'shocking', 'amoral', 'sociopathic', 'savagery', 'wounded', 'bird', 'cat.When', 'watched', 'scenes', 'had', 'epiphany', '-the', 'source', 'depravities', 'Holocaust', 'Stalinist', 'purges', 'genocide', 'Rwanda', 'never', 'been', 'about', 'race', 'religion', 'politics', 'tribe', '-all', 'dark', 'desire', 'men', 'inflict', 'brutality', 'weak', 'better', 'reason', 'derive', 'pleasure', 'doing', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'take', 'can', 'grab.This', 'philosophy', 'underscores', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'opinion', 'reason', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'painting', 'realistic', 'picture', 'human', 'horror', 'Renfro', 'Tod', 'Bowden', 'not', 'young', 'Nazi', 'killers', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'bored', 'coward', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'decidedly', 'cruel', 'streak.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Friends', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'hapless', 'Jewish', 'high', 'school', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'taking', 'yet', 'repulsive', 'role', 'one', 'McKellen', 'vagrant', 'victims', 'American', 'Psycho', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'not', 'exit', 'film', 'easy', 'answers', 'leaving', 'uneasy', 'viewer', 'disturbing', 'coda', 'question', 'cruelty', 'force', 'can', 'be', 'harnessed', 'power', 'ultimately', 'empty', 'universe', 'where', 'voice', 'God', 'silent', 'why', 'not', 'JSG']",N/A

Brad Renfro plays the part of a  young boy in the midst of studying Nazi Germany at his high school. Upon  reading several books and viewing numerous photographic accounts, he  discovers that a man who lives in his town is really a Nazi officer  secretly hiding in America to escape persecution in his own land for his  war crimes. The boy pays a visit to confront the man, Mr. Dussander, played  by Ian McKellen. In exchange for his blackmailer's silence in the matter,  Dussander keeps up his part of hte bargain by agreeing to tell the boy  everything he wants to know about what happened in the Nazi concentration  camps. The more the boy inquires into the old man's past, the more the old  man begins to unlock the devil inside of him from long ago, and he begins  to go back to his past through actions and emotional outbursts. Soon, the  both of them are tangled in a web of lies, deceit, and suspense that  neither of them can escape.

Premiered at the Venice Film Festival and due to hit theaters Oct. 16, this Sony release has dual potential audiences -- teens drawn by the Stephen King name and more discerning viewers interested in Singer and McKellen -- which should combine for reasonable returns. But pic's claustrophobic nature and relative lack of action will likely prevent it from breaking out with a wider public.Premise is deftly set up, as, in 1984, 16-year-old senior Todd Bowden (Renfro) becomes fascinated by the Holocaust in a school course and, via an old photograph, recognizes a grizzled local resident as one Kurt Dussander (McKellen), a former officer at the Paten concentration camp, where 90,000 prisoners died.Brazenly, Todd turns up at the old man's door, announces that he has incontrovertible proof that he is, in fact, Dussander and, under threat of turning him in, commands the Nazi to tell him the brutal truth about what he did during the war. ""I want to hear about it,"" Todd insists. ""Everything. Everything they're afraid to show us in school.""A month later, Todd is still listening with morbid fascination to the drunken geezer as he relates his stories, hardly any of which are imposed upon the viewer. Shuffling around his squalid house, wearing raggedy clothes and sporting a goatee, specs and nicotine-stained teeth, Dussander is a pathetic sight, but he still possesses a sharp, imperious manner, and McKellen insidiously conveys the threat of evil yet to emerge from beneath the years of besotted forgetfulness and rationalization.Todd goes so far as to bring his new friend to dinner, where Dussander tells the boy's parents (Bruce Davison, Ann Dowd) that he spent the war toiling in a hospital.As if in revenge for the bad dreams and fantasies he begins having (he imagines the boys in his high school gym shower turning into old camp victims, for example), Todd gives Dussander a Christmas present of a pristine Nazi uniform and instructs him to put it on. Complaining that, ""It itches like hell,"" Dussander reluctantly obeys Todd's orders to stand at attention and march, but eventually gets into it to the point of becoming a robotic Nazi, marching maniacally and compulsively heiling with arm extended.His old self thus revived, Dussander warns Todd that he's playing with fire, then veers over the top into some dramatically ludicrous behavior, such as trying to put a stray cat into his oven. For his part, Todd is now so preoccupied by Nazi evil that he can no longer perform sexually and shortly sees his outstanding grades decline to a level that threatens his chances for college.Story's second half sees the diabolical Dussander managing to turn the tables on Todd, who does some fancy footwork to recoup his standing at school but still can't avoid being further corrupted and, ultimately, morally poisoned by his contact with the long-ago mass murderer. Multiple climaxes extend the story unadvisedly and involve some violent melodrama that's hard to swallow, including a ""Carrie""-like resurrection from presumed death.Aside from these handful of rather coarse story incidents, the main shortcoming is a failure to take Todd's fascination with Dussander far enough, to precisely analyze the attraction evil has for him and, by extension, the potential anyone may have for inhuman acts under certain circumstances. An early scene of Todd sketching swastikas in school suggests a growing capitulation to the external trappings of Nazism and indicates a path that would have taken ""Apt Pupil"" to an even more disturbing destination than it actually arrives at: Had the film explored the way fascism can pull people under its spell and lead them from their better natures, if it had shown how Dussander's stories played on Todd's latent feelings of superiority to others and infected him with fantasies of power, it really would have been on to something. As it is, Todd's motivation to spend so much time with Dussander seems to stem from little more than a sadistic desire to humiliate the old man for his crimes.All the same, screenwriter Brandon Boyce, in adapting King's novella, has outfitted the story with a goodly number of intense confrontations and nasty twists, and Singer has directed with a disciplined approach to maintaining tension and building a malevolent mood.Although the film adopts Todd's p.o.v., McKellen's Dussander represents its center of attention, and the thesp socks over his performance with outstanding power and the gradual revelation of layers, each one more malignant than the one before. With this and ""Gods and Monsters,"" McKellen is having quite a year onscreen. Renfro goes as far as the conception of his part will allow and holds his own with his distinguished co-star. Of the supporting players, David Schwimmer is quietly effective as a school counselor hoodwinked by Todd and Dussander, and Michael Byrne is devastating as a camp survivor who recognizes Dussander as his tormentor from 40 years earlier.Modestly budgeted production, which is significantly smaller in scope than Singer's breakthrough second feature, ""The Usual Suspects,"" is smooth in all departments.",5,excellent psychological thriller,1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,5592,"['creepy', 'well-acted', 'story', 'contagious', 'evil', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'more', 'enough', 'chilling', 'dramatic',

Insofar as the books and the films are concerned, The Dead Zone is marvellous, because the film does not in any way distort the book. Cronenberg has done a beautiful  job. The film gives a visual dimension to the book and hence enriches it in  a way.  But with Apt Pupil, there are so many twists and changes that the  book is difficult to recognize in the film. We do not find the progressive  and absolutely total degradation of both Mr Denker and Todd. Todd does not  kill vagrant people in the film. Mr Denker only kills one wino. He even  fails with the cat.  The boy, Todd, is not cornered as he is in the  book, cornered by his conscience and by the police and his guidance  councelor, as he is in the book. He becomes vicious but his degradation is  far from being finished and he can survive and even prosper in our society  with his new agressive domineering attitude. He might even be seen as a  winner. In the book he is a loser.  We lose the essential lesson: to get  involved with those crimes, at a certain age, if it is not done with care  and distanciation, in a discursive way, with aware adults, it leads to  degradation because evil is catching and there is no remedy, no medicine to  cure it. I guess that we can maybe enjoy the film, if we do not know  the book, even if the swiftness of the film erases most details and most  dark corners in the tale.  I definitely prefered the book.

16312,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0767821599,Jeffrey Leach,"[4, 5]","When I discovered a Stephen King short story provided the impetus for Bryan Singer's 1998 film ""Apt Pupil,"" I cringed in horror. Not because I thought the movie would succeed wildly, but because I am all too familiar with cinematic adaptations of King's work. For every ""Carrie"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" we must suffer through a plethora of half-realized schlock made only to cash in on the writer's fan base. I remember the story upon which this film is based, although my recollections are vague because I read it roughly fifteen years ago. Having said that, I am fairly certain Singer takes substantial liberties with his retelling. Changing a few things around isn't all bad, however, since even King admits that certain horrific scenes shoehorned into film versions of his stories work so well that he wishes he had thought of them during the writing process. But going into this film took a bit of nerve on my part, specifically steeling said nerves, because I dreaded seeing another piece of ""Stephen King presents"" junk. I also worried over the presence of Brad Renfro, who has done good work before but sometimes doesn't fit in a role well. I needn't have worried.""Apt Pupil"" is the story of Todd Bowden, a brilliant high school student and athlete with everything going for him in life. His family--father Richard (Bruce Davidson), mother Monica (Ann Dowd), grandfather Victor (James Karen) and grandmother Agnes (Marjorie Lovett)--care about him deeply. His friend Joey (Joshua Jackson) and his girlfriend Becky Trask (Heather McComb) provide plenty of entertainment away from home. So why would Todd Bowden become so interested in the Third Reich after learning about it in a history class? His interest, it seems, centers on an enigmatic man living nearby who Todd suspects may well be the notorious German war criminal Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen). Young Bowden's copious and thorough research provides him with enough evidence to walk up to the man's door and confront him with the findings. Predictably, Dussander tries to deny everything, claiming he is merely a poor German immigrant who smokes and drinks too much and who is in poor health. While these things are certainly true, so is the fact that this man bears the responsibility for the deaths of thousands of Jews. Instead of turning Dussander into the authorities, Bowden blackmails the aging criminal into telling him what really happened during the holocaust.What follows does not bear out in any way Hannah Arendt's ""banality of evil"" phrase. There's nothing banal at all about Dussander; he's a horrifying human being who rapidly begins to regress back into his old role thanks to Todd's demands. As for Bowden, the progression of the film reveals that he is as sick, if not sicker, than this aging war criminal. Todd purchases a uniform through a mail order house and forces Dussander to march around the house while wearing it. Why? To give Dussander's stories more color, I guess, but it's very warped and not at all healthy. Eventually, Bowden comes to regret his intervention in this man's life when Dussander begins to fight back. Blackmail turns to counter blackmail as Bowden and Dussander spar for a position of supremacy in the relationship. Both degenerate under the pressure, and it isn't too long before murder enters the picture. Perhaps the conclusion is inevitable and predictable, but Bowden's sinister confrontation with his high school guidance counselor, Edward French (David Schwimmer), is anything but predictable. The young man vividly reveals how well he assimilated the lessons taught to him by Dussander. He is indeed an apt pupil.""Apt Pupil"" works so well thanks to the strengths of its two lead characters. Renfro has rarely turned in as good a performance as he does here, giving us a nuanced interpretation of a troubled young man with plenty of dark secrets to hide. McKellen, it should go without saying, is always good in anything he chooses to take on. ""Apt Pupil"" is no exception as the veteran actor radiates chills with a look, a smile, or a slight movement of his body. Renfro and McKellen have great chemistry together onscreen, so much so that it is difficult to imagine any other actors in their place. What doesn't work as well is the confrontation between French and Bowden. For some inexplicable reason, I sympathized with Todd Bowden and secretly hoped he would come out on top. This sensation is not a positive one, and I wondered afterwards if director Singer wanted the audience to feel this way. It would make sense to try and bring viewers to a closer understanding of Bowden's particular sickness since by doing so we would come away with a better understanding of how the Third Reich managed to inspire so many people to help them carry out their sordid activities. Whatever the case, ""Apt Pupil"" is definitely a disturbing film. As for the DVD version, supplements on the disc include a trailer, cast and crew biographies and filmographies, and a short behind the scenes featurette.",5,Sickening,1105228800,"01 9,

Brad Renfoe (Todd Bowden) is a very bright high school student with a great future ahead of himself!However in his small souther California town one day he discovers a secret no one would ever even think of. A Nazi war criminal lives right down the block from him. This man is Sir Ian McKellen (Kurt Dussander) and is living in his home without a clue that his past could catch up with him. It does....but in no way he could have thought! So after Bowden tells Dussander he knows his secrets, he wants him to tell of all the things that aren't in the text books at school. Here is where the movie picks up. They form a friendship if you dare call it that. That goes into a twist even more twisted when Dussander meets Bowden's parents. So instead of having this old man in his plam like he thought, Bowden discovers first hand that evil is very close too him and it didn't die when Dussander left Germany after the war. Bryan Singer shows his steady hand as the film has many different twist and turns. A supporting cast that features Elias Koteas, David Schwimmer and Bruce Davison (Todd's dad)!

He takes his neighbor's newspaper and while at the door he tells him that he knows who he really is.Todd had taken Kurt's photo and got his fingerprints off of his mail box.  He got a match from the Israeli war criminals web site.  The prints are a very good match.  Kurt is known for torturing prisoners in the concentration camps and doing experiments on them.  Todd threatens to turn Kurt into the authorities but he makes a compromise, he wants to learn more about the things done by the Nazis during the war and how the people in the gas chambers died......This film is made from a Stephen King novella and even though it is not a supernatural horror film it is terrifying in its own way.  This story is horrific because it is about the inhumanity that men can do to other people.  King's story touches on the hatred and cold blooded killing of the concentration camps and the movie brings those items out in detail.Kurt in the movie is a pathological liar who has done it all his life and he has gotten good at hiding his past.

16318,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0767821599,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","This 1998 film by X-Men director Bryan Singer is an adaptation of a Stephen King novella, which is one of the most compelling pieces of work by King I've ever read. The film adaptation takes many liberties (as with most King adaptations) and, unfortunately, changes much of the tone of the original story. It's not a film without any merit though.The late Brad Renfro plays Todd Bowden, a young high school student who has been studying World War II and following an elderly man (Ian McKellen) that lives in his neighborhood. The man, named Arthur Denker, keeps pretty much to himself and through his own investigations; Todd has found Denker to be a wanted Nazi war-criminal named Kurt Dussander. Todd quickly assures Dussander that he does not plan to turn him in, but simply wants to know everything that Dussander knows. Initially unnerved by the boy, Dussander obliges him.The script is written by Brandon Boyce, who apparently didn't have the time to build up the characters at all. The film jumps right into the plot, wasting no time. While retaining the dark elements of King's story for the most part, the story is handled in a much ""lighter"" way than the source material. I found the novella to be a dark, complex tale. Having toned it down, the complexity seems to have vanished. Singer has acknowledged his intent to make a ""study in cruelty"" and ""a movie sort of in the spirit of a real horror movie."" I think Singer failed to live up to the former goal, but has succeeded in translating the relationship between Dussander and Todd to the screen. Their twisted friendship is handled so well and poignantly in the novella and, on film; it's one of the strongest points, even with Singer's heavy-handed homosexual undertones.Without a doubt, the film's strongest asset, as well as its most memorable quality, is the performance by Ian McKellen. He's the perfect Dussander, embodying him almost exactly as I pictured him while reading. I feared Dussander, but also trusted him. McKellen makes him a grandfatherly figure to Todd, but you can still see the intensely burning evil in his eyes. The scene with the cat could've ended up being hilarious with another actor, but McKellen makes it a disturbing moment.As for Renfro's performance, I always thought he showed remarkable potential as an actor but fell short in his portrayal of Todd. I think he captured it better than any other actor his age could have at the time the film was made, but Renfro made Todd whiny and sadistic, rather than brilliant and disturbed. I never really believed while watching the film that Todd was an intelligent character. While Renfro might not quite capture the psychological complexity of his character, he did hold his own against McKellen making for a memorable on-screen partnership.The supporting cast is efficient, even David Schwimmer as Todd's guidance counselor. Another stand-out is Elias Koteas as a homeless man who falls victim to Dussander. Most of this review has simply compared the novella and the film and I need to clarify that I can separate the source material from the adaptation. Had I not read the novella, my opinion would remain the same about the film. It has a great performance by McKellen, but is hardly as complex and disturbing as it tries to be. The saddest part to me is that if a film adaptation of the novella was handled properly, it could be a masterpiece. Apt Pupil has many characteristics to applaud, but it's no masterpiece. If anything, you'll be entertained and you'll find it hard to look away from McKellen's brilliant performance, a great example of when an actor rises far above the material he's given to perform.GRADE: C+",3,"A Great Performance by Ian McKellen, But a Disappointing Adaptation",1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,3667,"['1998', 'film', 'X-Men', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novella', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'pieces', 'work', 'King', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'film', 'adaptation', 'many', 'liberties', 'most', 'King', 'adaptations', 'unfortunately', 'changes', 'much', 'tone', 'original', 'story', 'not', 'film', 'merit', 'though.The', 'late', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'Todd', 'Bowden', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'been', 'studying', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'following', 'elderly', 'man', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'neighborhood', 'man', 'named', 'Arthur', 'Denker', 'pretty', 'much', 'own', 'investigations', 'Todd', 'found', 'Denker', 'be', 'wanted', 'Nazi', 'war-criminal', 'named', 'Kurt', 'Dussander', 'Todd', 'quickly', 'Dussander', 'not', 'plan', 'turn', 'simply', 'know', 'everything', 'Dussander', 'Initially', 'unnerved', 'boy', 'Dussander', 'script', 'written', 'Brandon', 'Boyce', 'who', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'characters', 'film', 'jumps', 'right', 'plot', 'wasting', 'time', 'retaining', 'dark', 'elements', 'King', 'story', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'handled', 'much', 'lighter', 'way', 'source', 'material', 'found', 'novella', 'be', 'dark', 'complex', 'tale', 'Having', 'toned', 'down', 'complexity', 'have', 'vanished', 'Singer', 'acknowledged', 'intent', 'make', 'study', 'cruelty', 'movie', 'sort', 'spirit', 'real', 'horror', 'movie', 'think', 'Singer', 'failed', 'live', 'up', 'former', 'goal', 'succeeded', 'translating', 'relationship', 'Dussander', 'Todd', 'screen', 'twisted', 'friendship', 'handled', 'so', 'well', 'poignantly', 'novella', 'film', 'one', 'strongest', 'points', 'even', 'Singer', 'heavy-handed', 'homosexual', 'doubt', 'film', 'strongest', 'asset', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'memorable', 'quality', 'performance', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'perfect', 'Dussander', 'embodying', 'almost', 'exactly', 'pictured', 'reading', 'feared', 'Dussander', 'also', 'trusted', 'McKellen', 'grandfatherly', 'figure', 'Todd', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'intensely', 'burning', 'evil', 'eyes', 'scene', 'cat', 'could', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'hilarious', 'actor', 'McKellen', 'disturbing', 'moment.As', 'Renfro', 'performance', 'always', 'thought', 'showed', 'remarkable', 'potential', 'actor', 'fell', 'short', 'portrayal', 'Todd', 'think', 'captured', 'better', 'other', 'actor', 'age', 'could', 'have', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Renfro', 'made', 'Todd', 'whiny', 'sadistic', 'rather', 'brilliant', 'disturbed', 'never', 'really', 'believed', 'watching', 'film', 'Todd', 'was', 'intelligent', 'character', 'Renfro', 'might', 'not', 'quite', 'capture', 'psychological', 'complexity', 'character', 'did', 'hold', 'own', 'McKellen', 'making', 'memorable', 'on-screen', 'partnership.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'efficient', 'even', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Todd', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'stand-out', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'homeless', 'man', 'who', 'victim', 'Dussander', 'Most', 'review', 'simply', 'compared', 'novella', 'film', 'need', 'clarify', 'can', 'separate', 'source', 'material', 'adaptation', 'Had', 'not', 'read', 'novella', 'opinion', 'would', 'remain', 'same', 'film', 'great', 'performance', 'McKellen', 'hardly', 'complex', 'disturbing', 'be', 'saddest', 'part', 'film', 'adaptation', 'novella', 'was', 'handled', 'properly', 'could', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'Apt', 'Pupil', 'many', 'characteristics', 'applaud', 'masterpiece', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'be', 'entertained', ""'ll"", 'find', 'hard', 'look', 'away', 'McKellen', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'great', 'example', 'when', 'actor', 'far', 'material', 'given', 'perform.GRADE', 'C+']",N/A

Forced to recount the details of his murderous past to the boy, who threatens to expose him otherwise, these two deeply unpleasant characters begin to awaken long-dormant mutual impulses, with inevitably tragic consequences...Superbly acted, especially by the two leads, and directed by Singer with exquisite grace from Brandon Boyce's tightly-constructed screenplay, the film explores the ways in which history affects the present, and how the seeds of genocide can blossom unexpectedly from within the most ordinary - seemingly benign - circumstances. When Renfro asks McKellen how it felt to kill people, he's actually testing his own capacity for unimaginable evil, and one suddenly understands how the Holocaust was possible, and how a similar atrocity could easily happen again, even in the most 'civilized' society. Despite first-class performances and production values, the movie wasn't a box-office success, partly because we're invited to sympathize with an unrepentant monster and his all-too-willing disciple. David Schwimmer, Elias Koteas, Bruce Davison and Joshua Jackson are featured in brief supporting roles.NB. Similar territory is explored in Agustin Villaronga's extraordinary thriller IN A GLASS CAGE (1986), a Spanish masterpiece in which a former Nazi doctor is visited at his isolated home by one of his victims, a young man whose experiences as a child in the concentration camps have unleashed all kinds of monsters from his broken mind.

16325,A2M1N8G4W4END8,0767821599,Michael R Gates,"[3, 4]","Director Bryan Singer seems fascinated by the dense blackness that comprises the unpleasant side of the human psyche, and he has built a reputation on creating films that explore those darker facets of mankind.  Fans will not be disappointed, then, by APT PUPIL (1998).  It is a riveting but disturbing fictional thriller that deals with the real-life subjects of evil and the Holocaust, the latter being a topic that is often regarded as too sensitive and controversial for all but non-fictional works.  With APT PUPIL--which is based on a Stephen King novella--Singer actually uses the Holocaust as a backdrop for his exploration of the ease with which evil can take root in even the most prosaic of locations in the everyday world.  And to a lesser degree, the film is also Singer's comment on the strong influence that an authority figure can have on shaping the worldview of a nave and eager disciple.In the film, an American high-school honor student (Brad Renfro) who is fascinated by the history of WWII--specifically the Holocaust--discovers that an elderly German &eacute;migr&eacute; (Ian McKellen) living in the neighborhood is actually a hunted Nazi war criminal incognito, and the clever boy is able to gather enough evidence of this fact that he could easily expose the old man's true identity.  But instead of turning his data over to the authorities, the boy uses it to muscle the elderly gent into sharing the details of the atrocities he committed during the war--details that ""they're afraid to tell us about in school.""Of course, the old Nazi is outraged, but he also knows he's been trapped.  So he ultimately resigns himself to the situation, and detailed stories of heinous actions he does tell.  It isn't long before the recounting of his wartime atrocities awakens the old man's long-dormant fiendish and sadistic urges.  And though the stories at first give the boy nightmares, it doesn't take too long for the boy's mind to start soaking up the vicious and perverse Nazi philosophy like a sponge soaks up water.  The boy is an apt pupil indeed.The acting in APT PUPIL is nothing short of superb.  As the Nazi fugitive, the venerable Ian McKellen delivers a tour-de-force performance.  He skillfully creates a convincing portrait of an utterly sadistic and amoral personality that is successfully kept hidden behind the faade of a subdued and affable persona. McKellen's performance is so realistic, in fact, that one is simultaneously awed by the actor's talent and disturbed by his characterization.  Brad Renfro is also excellent--and frightening--as the white-bread everyboy whose minor inclination towards sadism is transformed into unfettered evil under the influence of the aging Nazi refugee.  And though Renfro hasn't McKellen's range of skill or experience, he plays well against his mature colleague and does not come off as second-best.David Schwimmer--better known from his role as Ross on TV's wildly popular FRIENDS--gives a believable and refreshingly somber performance in a supporting role as the boy's school counselor.  And genre fans will surely recognize Bruce Davison, here playing the boy's father, from his break-out performance as the titular character in the original WILLARD (1971).  Fans may also recognize genre regular James Karen, who here appears as the boy's grandfather.As stated before, it is often considered a no-no to reference or address the Holocaust in fictional films.  So it's not surprising that some critics decry APT PUPIL for trivializing the Holocaust and the suffering of Holocaust victims. But this criticism is unfounded, especially in light of the character treatment in this film.  While it may be true that McKellen's interpretation of the fugitive Nazi is sometimes sympathetic, the actor never portrays the old man as repentant and therefore never assuages the repugnance or wickedness of the acts committed by such Nazis during WWII.  And when the boy reveals what HE has become under the old Nazi's tutelage, his true nature is regarded as frightening and dangerous and NOT glamorous or alluring.The DVD edition from Columbia/Tristar is a two-sided disc that offers an anamorphic widescreen version of the film in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio (side A), as well as a full-screen pan-and-scan version of the film (Side B).  The widescreen version is pristine, with few, if any, visible digital or filmic artifacts.  Also on the disc are the original theatrical trailer and a short making-of featurette.  All in all, this is an impeccable, reasonably priced edition of a captivating film that belongs in the collections of all serious genre fans or lovers of good cinema.",4,Don't believe true evil exists?

16326,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,0767821599,Mr. Cairene,"[1, 1]","Apt Pupil is a simaltainously fascinating and unpleasant experience. Todd's(Brad Renfro) obsession with the Nazi war criminal is a wrong place to start because it is clear right from the beginning that Todd, who is  supposed to represent innocence lost, is a phsycotic in his own right,  which makes his descent to depravity and lies less compelling. Because of  the subject matter of the film we are not able to enjoy the villian, he is  simply too nasty. It is a testament to our desensitization that a character  attempting to burn a cat is more revolting than murdering another human  being, but unfortunatly that is the case. We've seen many murders on screen  but hardly any cats being thrown into ovens or crippled pigieons be crushed  to death by a basketball. I also didn't buy Todd turning murderous, it  comes as something completely arbitrary and not in step with the rest of  his actions. I did however find his relationship with his guidance councler  superbly handled, his final scene with him seems like a much more realistic  level that Todd would sink to rather then murder. With villians that lack  the charm of a Hannibal Lecter or the grim fascination of a John Doe in  Seven why is this tale of evil worth watching? I can't put my finger on it,  but it is all grimly compelling and thought provactive. By the time the  last third of the film rolls around you may not be exilerated but you will  be fixated to the screen. This is Bryan Singer's second film, and it is  extremely well made, but you can feel him reaching, as in the shower scene  where Todd halucinates about a holocuast victim.

It is a devilish appearance and this confirms the multi-faceted talents of a Great Actor as McKellen rightfully is.Brad Renfro, although playing his role with honesty, is far less threatening as one may wish, although he adds a component of freshness to his role, in which we can honestly believe.Younger generations can, at times, be very cruel, but don't many times, fully understand or appreciate the risks and dangers connected with reopening old wounds in elder people.It is a very interesting social case study, very well developed by director Bryan Singer, who is a very good storyteller and paces all his movies in such a way, as never becoming stale.It is shocking to see that at times, fiction foretells reality.But this is not just a thriller or a psychological horror movie, it is far more. It is a warning.Let the past rest, learn from it, but do not conjure it up again, or you will pay the consequences...A great lesson and truly well developed.I can only recommend it, but be adviced, this is a most disturbing movie.

Sometimes the most frightening things are the terrible possibilities we find within ourselves -- if we dare to look.  Much of this film consists of psychological games, but that doesn't make it any less terrifying.  If you have ever wondered how ordinary good citizens (like yourself???) could have ended up serving the Nazi genocide machine, then this movie is a chillingly real answer.  An excellent study in how seemingly moral people can be manipulated by fear and seduced by power.What starts out as an honor student's curiousity about a dark chapter in history soon degenerates into cruelty and manipulation on both sides.  The student begins by blackmailing an old Nazi war criminal into telling him all about the concentration camps -- and that means EVERYTHING -- or else he will turn him over to the authorities.  The old Nazi, fearing arrest, complies.  But the boy soon goes beyond curiousity, as he begins to enjoy having absolute power over another human being.  At this point, the student is the sadist, and I actually found myself feeling sorry for the old man.  But wait -- the Nazi still has a few tricks up his sleeve, and the tables are soon turned...

Apt Pupil, a film that followed his slam-dunk with Suspects, misses the mark in many ways.  It takes Stephen King's intricate exploration of evil and turns it into a banal story about a mean kid and an old man who turns out to be the smarter of the two (and is then himself outdone by circumstances beyond his control).  The early scenes, meant to establish Todd's character and contrast him with Denker/Dussander, seem like set pieces.  One morning Todd's mother says she wants to have D/D for dinner and that night he's there, complete with Grandpa, who lives a continent away.  Singer, of course, is using this scene to set things up for a later scene in which D/D fools Todd's naive guidance counselor by pretending to be that grandpa.Todd's own malevolence is present from the beginning of his relationship with D/D, but it's never explained.  In the book, Todd morphs from a typical preteen into the monster he is from the beginning of the movie.  Strangely, that malevolence is kept on a short leash.  While King has Todd killing winos in the trainyard, Singer merely shows him crushing an injured pigeon with a basketball.  D/D's own evil is also underplayed, sometimes for laughs, it seems.  His attempt to kill a stray cat in his oven, successful in the book, comes across as Keystone Kops stuff as the tabby exits the conveniently open window.The film does coalesce for a time in the section in which the guidance counselor strikes a ""deal"" with Todd to bring his grades up in time for graduation (in the novella, he's no older than fourteen).  ""Grandpa"" D/D guarantees success, and it is achieved.  With D/D's heart attack and subsequent surgery, it appears that Todd is clear and free to navigate the wondrous landscape opening before him.  But when D/D is revealed as the Nazi murderer he is, the counselor confronts Todd.  This is by far the strongest scene.  In the novella, Todd shoots the counselor and then begins a sniper session above the freeway.  While this is the more likely outcome in real life, Singer makes his statement when Todd intimidates the one man who could bring him down.This, I believe, is the purpose of his film:  To demonstrate that the will and skill that lead to success in American life often fall into evil.  In this, he was prophetic.  A decade later, the collapse of Wall Street, a direct result of unbridled greed, would unleash suffering across the land.Three of the four novellas in King's Different Seasons have now been filmed, leaving only ""The Breathing Method"" undone.

I thought Bryan Singer's vision of ""Apt Pupil"" left in (and left out) everything that was approprate. I admire Ian McKellan no end, and he did not disappoint. I always thought that Brad Renfro's auspicious debut in ""The Client"" would lead to great things. Here, he succeeds. It's a layered performance of unsettling discovery, conflict & resolution...and a few surprises. Elias Koteas, in a small role, was best of all. His role as street person/hustler was complete, and I must admit that his final scene lef me a bit unsettled, very sad. I will not blab anyhing away, but I thought this to be a fine and very upsetting film. I'm somewhat amused at the controversy involving Singer's shower room scene, where he asked a number of young males to appear nude (they signed affidavits of approval). No one really cared, except one guy sued him for misreprentation or whatever. (How humiliating was that for him?) This was a 1998 film. Brian de Palma's ""Carrie"" with Oscar-nominee Sissy Spacek (1976) had a brutal shower scene, full-frontal, the whole 9 yards, and nobody made issue. Nudity doesn't bother me, if it makes sense.

The student rather than reporting to authorities his discovery, attempts to blackmail the old man: he won't tell anyone if he tells him stories from the dead camp he was in charge of.This incredible thriller takes some surprising twists as the story unfolds. The acting is superb, Ian McKellen as Dussander (the Nazi fugitive) and Brad Renfro deliver some of the most disturbing sequences of the film, from the stories being told by McKellen (excellent flashback scenes) to the sequence in which he wears the Nazi uniform again, the performance delivered by these two actors is one of the highlights of the film.A story of how evil may present in the less expected ways and how a teenager falls under the clutches of the Nazi killer he thought he had under control. The directorial style of Singer is all over the film, the score composed by John Ottman is the perfect complement in some of the key scenes. Some of Singer `regulars' are here on brief cameos and there is the special appearance of David Schwimmer (even though he tries to portray a serious character, the stigma of Ross Geller won't leave him) Bottom-line, an excellent thriller filled with surprising twists, excellent sequences from the Nazi's dead camps and a shocking ending.The DVD comes in both Widescreen and Full screen versions.

It does so because writer Boyce and director Singer wisely ditch most of King's by-the-numbers gore in favor of a far more interesting focus on his two amazing characters.  This is a more tightly constructed narrative than the novella, and it replaces the unnecessarily violent climax with a scene which is more subtle, more credible, and therefore far more chilling.  The young Brad Renfro strikes an exquisite balance between innocence and menace, and Ian McKellen is at times legitimately terrifying as the aged Nazi. (See ""Richard III"" for another of McKellen's Nazi variations.)  So why did this film do so poorly at the US boxoffice? From the tone of most of the criticism, it's apparently because it deals with a difficult subject and argues an unpopular case: that the horrors inflicted in the name of Nazism were not necessarily a manifestation of a particular time, place or national perversion. Rather, they represent the activation of a potential for evil which exists in us all - yes, even in the heart of the all-American boy.

16339,A31M2QHES2IMB,0767821599,"Steven Scott ""LeChuck""","[1, 2]","I was very disappointed in this movie. There are several reasons why I wanted to see it, and they could have made it really well, but failed. The book is excellent. It's a novella in the Stephen King book, Different Seasons. A couple other stories in here were made into movies, including The Shawshank Redemption directed to perfection by Frank Darabont, and The Body which was directed by Rob Reiner and renamed Stand By Me. Both were excellent stories in the book and adapted very well into movies. Apt Pupil in the book was great. Very intriguing, great suspense, and got into the minds of the characters which is what really makes a good narration.So adding that fact as well as that the movie was directed by Bryan Singer, who directed The Usual Suspects, which is one of my favorite movies, I was excited about seeing this. I thought that Ian McKellen and Brad Renfro were perfect casting. I couldn't see anyone else in those roles doing it better. I thought David Schwimmer was completely miscast as Ed French, who had a much bigger role in the book. I also don't think this movie was really dark enough and nowhere near as suspenseful as the book.The main thing they should have changed about this was the script. They really chopped this down without building any tension and it really could have been better with some narration. I think the best book to movie adaptations are the ones with a narrator which Shawshank and Stand By Me both had, which helps you to learn things about characters and know what's going on in their minds.
