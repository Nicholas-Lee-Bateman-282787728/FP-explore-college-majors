It has to be some of the best stuff on television today.  It's not even the subject matter or graphic scenes depicting plastic surgery procedures, that's just there to calm things down a bit.  The real shock value comes from the relationships and personalities which can be obsessively engaging. I am especially  drawn to the interrelations between Christian and Sean, best friends since college and now partners in their prominent and very successful plastic surgery practice.  Christian's outward demeanor is all ego but inside he's just a scared little boy in search of love.  He has morals although they stay well hidden and are rarely used.  Okay, maybe they just aren't there but he's really handsome, very easy on the eyes and fun to watch, even if it's just as a warning of the type of guy to stay clear of.Sean seems to struggle with everything, thinks too deeply and is as much of an egotist as his partner but with a little more heart.  Everyone in this drama is damaged to some degree but all seem to be seeking redemption which makes it watchable and even endearing in a strange way.

I have to admit that I do not own season two as of yet, but I do plan on buying it, so for those of you looking to see what the extras are I don't know, but those of you wanting to know what your missing by not watching this show, let me tell you.  Doctor Troy (Julian MaMahon) and Dr. Macnamara (Dylan Walsh) are Miami's top plastic surgions.  Season one will introduce you to these two men and their mistakes in life as long as their freindship to one another.  In the outset of season two Christian is fighting for custody of a child whom is not his own but who was bore by his ex girlfriend of sorts and she is not fit to raise a child.  Christian, while dealing with this also must deal with the fact that he is a father, but he fathered his best friends son (in effect he had an affair with his best friends wife years in the past)...and his son, who has no idea that Christian is his father, is now haveing an affair with his life coach (Famka)...all of that plus a serial killer of sorts and the scare of HIV and you hardly pay attention to the MEDICAL aspects of the show...the actin is superb and with each passing episode you get more and more drawn into the twisting storylines touching on the subjects of incest, sex-addiction, drug abuse, murder, malpractice, stachatory-rape, theres even an episode where Dylan Walsh makes love to a blow up doll.  Be foreward, the sex and nudity is rampant, enough for my wife to ban it from our house (but she sleeps hard so that doesn't really matter)...Great show and well worth the money...buy season one too so you can see it from the very beginning, you'll be glad that you did.",5,This show is hands down the most addictive show I've ever watched!,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,1830,"['need', 'say', 'writing', 'season', 'two', 'story', 'lines', 'amazing', 'acting', 'everyone', 'cast', 'especially', 'Joley', 'Richardson', 'Famka', 'Janssen', 'made', 'season', 'two', 'just', 'utterly', 'amazing', 'have', 'admit', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'season', 'two', 'yet', 'do', 'plan', 'buying', 'so', 'looking', 'see', 'what', 'extras', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'missing', 'not', 'watching', 'show', 'let', 'tell', 'Doctor', 'Troy', 'Julian', 'MaMahon', 'Dr.', 'Macnamara', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'are', 'Miami', 'top', 'plastic', 'surgions', 'Season', 'one', 'will', 'introduce', 'two', 'men', 'mistakes', 'life', 'as', 'long', 'freindship', 'one', 'outset', 'season', 'two', 'Christian', 'fighting', 'custody', 'child', 'whom', 'not', 'own', 'who', 'was', 'bore', 'ex', 'girlfriend', 'sorts', 'not', 'fit', 'raise', 'child', 'Christian', 'dealing', 'also', 'must', 'deal', 'fact', 'father', 'fathered', 'best', 'friends', 'son', 'effect', 'had', 'affair', 'best', 'friends', 'wife', 'years', 'past', 'son', 'who', 'idea', 'Christian', 'father', 'now', 'haveing', 'affair', 'life', 'coach', 'Famka', 'serial', 'killer', 'sorts', 'scare', 'HIV', 'hardly', 'pay', 'attention', 'MEDICAL', 'aspects', 'show', 'actin', 'superb', 'passing', 'episode', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'drawn', 'twisting', 'storylines', 'touching', 'subjects', 'incest', 'sex-addiction', 'drug', 'abuse', 'murder', 'malpractice', 'stachatory-rape', 'theres', 'even', 'episode', 'where', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'love', 'blow', 'up', 'doll', 'Be', 'foreward', 'sex', 'nudity', 'rampant', 'enough', 'wife', 'ban', 'house', 'hard', 'so', 'that', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'Great', 'show', 'well', 'money', 'buy', 'season', 'one', 'too', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'very', 'beginning', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",N/A

My wife told me to leave it on because she was a fan of ""Charmed"". Ever since that night, I have been an ENORMOUS fan of NIP/TUCK. Quite simply, there isn't a better show on television. It's as depraved and sordid as a bad soap opera, but with infinitely better writing, directing and, most of all, acting. Dylan Walsh is great as Sean, who even when he's doing the right thing sometimes seems to be the wrong thing. Joely Richardson is wonderful as the troubled but self-absorbed Julia, who just can't seem to choose what she wants more: A life of luxurious lifelessness or an exciting, passionate romance with the one man who truly loves her. And of course, there's that guy from ""Charmed"". JULIAN MCMAHON RULES THIS SHOW. It's just that simple. Christian Troy is one of the best characters ever to grace the small screen. A wonderfully hedonistic, and often times, cruel man who no matter how hard he tries just can't seem to mask the good in him. Really what makes this show work above all others is its relationship between Sean and Christian. Their love for each other is so strong that they know that one without the other is just incomplete.

906128,A3NYUEI1E3HXRO,B0009IW88K,"jarhead76 ""jh76""","[0, 0]","Watching the second season of ""Nip/Tuck"" again reminded me of the show that I enjoyed so much in the mid-2000s. This season was long before the writing went very south and the premise of the show and its characters became a complete shell of the original series. One the eve of the final episode, one critic from ""People"" accurately remarked that ""this show did not just jump the shark, it pole-vaulted the shark."" Though season three was watchable, season two was arguably the final quality season before the show began its deep decline. The producers decided that viewers wanted raunchy and outlandish plotlines instead of the good, quality writing and character development that was apparent in the first two seasons.Season two starts with Julia finding out the truth about the paternity of Matt, the ramifications of which would dominate the entire season and even parts of later seasons. The character of Sean McNamara begins to show a much darker side as he feels betrayed by his best friend and wife. He also has to deal with Matt's behavioral issues including an affair with a much older woman. Meanwhile, the character of Christian Troy, for a time, shows a much softer side. He tries to help an ex-lover gain custody of a child that he initially believed was his. He also offers to help Liz, who is gay, to conceive a child and briefly dates a blind woman. This season also plants the seed for the Carver plotline which would consume season 3. This shows that the writers were clever enough to plan in advance, making the whole Carver storyline more plausible and well-thought out. Unfortunately, this cleverness did not pay off in season 3 with the revealing of the Carver's identity. But that's another review for another day.It was not just the whole plastic surgery premise that makes the season work, it is the dynamics and chemistry between the three main characters (Christian, Sean, and Julia) and revolving door of interesting recurring characters (Matt, Kimber, Mrs. Grubman, Gina) that help season two. This is something that was sorely lacking in the later seasons as the producers began to introduce more one-dimensional characters and devalue the long-term characters in order to garner higher ratings in the short term.",5,Reminds you of how good of a show this was in the earlier seasons (Some SPOILERS),1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,2244,"['Watching', 'second', 'season', 'Nip/Tuck', 'again', 'reminded', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'mid-2000s', 'season', 'was', 'long', 'writing', 'went', 'very', 'south', 'premise', 'show', 'characters', 'became', 'complete', 'shell', 'original', 'series', 'One', 'eve', 'final', 'episode', 'one', 'critic', 'People', 'accurately', 'remarked', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'jump', 'shark', 'pole-vaulted', 'shark', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'watchable', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'arguably', 'final', 'quality', 'season', 'show', 'began', 'deep', 'decline', 'producers', 'decided', 'viewers', 'wanted', 'raunchy', 'outlandish', 'plotlines', 'instead', 'good', 'quality', 'writing', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'apparent', 'first', 'two', 'seasons.Season', 'two', 'starts', 'Julia', 'finding', 'out', 'truth', 'paternity', 'Matt', 'ramifications', 'would', 'dominate', 'entire', 'season', 'even', 'parts', 'later', 'seasons', 'character', 'Sean', 'McNamara', 'show', 'much', 'darker', 'side', 'betrayed', 'best', 'friend', 'wife', 'also', 'deal', 'Matt', 'behavioral', 'issues', 'including', 'affair', 'much', 'older', 'woman', 'Meanwhile', 'character', 'Christian', 'Troy', 'time', 'much', 'softer', 'side', 'help', 'ex-lover', 'gain', 'custody', 'child', 'initially', 'believed', 'was', 'also', 'help', 'Liz', 'who', 'gay', 'conceive', 'child', 'briefly', 'dates', 'blind', 'woman', 'season', 'also', 'plants', 'seed', 'Carver', 'plotline', 'would', 'consume', 'season', '3', 'writers', 'were', 'clever', 'enough', 'plan', 'advance', 'making', 'whole', 'Carver', 'storyline', 'more', 'plausible', 'well-thought', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'cleverness', 'did', 'not', 'pay', 'off', 'season', '3', 'revealing', 'Carver', 'identity', 'review', 'day.It', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'whole', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'premise', 'season', 'work', 'dynamics', 'chemistry', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Christian', 'Sean', 'Julia', 'revolving', 'door', 'interesting', 'recurring', 'characters', 'Matt', 'Kimber', 'Mrs.', 'Grubman', 'Gina', 'help', 'season', 'two', 'something', 'was', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'later', 'seasons', 'producers', 'began', 'introduce', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'devalue', 'long-term', 'characters', 'order', 'garner', 'higher', 'ratings', 'short', 'term']",N/A

Durham ""Big Evil""","[76, 85]","The second season of FX's Nip/Tuck went above and beyond the conventions set during it's first season, with plenty of shocks and surprises for all involved.  Beginning with Christian (Julian McMahon, soon to be seen as the villainous Dr. Doom in Fantastic Four) fighting for custody of the son he knows isn't his, while Sean (Dylan Walsh) ponders over hitting the big four 0.  Eventually, Sean comes across a mysterious ""life coach"" (Famke Janssen) who soon begins a dangerous affair with Sean's oldest son.  This leads to a shocking revelation for Sean, Christian, and Sean's wife Julia (the teriffic Arly Jover) that soon becomes one of the most gut wrenchingly heartbreaking moments on TV today.  But it doesn't end there.  Christian comes face to face with the possibility that he might be HIV positive, and Sean comes face to face with a knife wielding masked would be killer after he does some pro bono work for victims mutilated by him.  All this ends in a season ending cliffhanger that will have you salivating for season three, which hopefully, will be just as surprising.  The personal demons of Sean and Christian are what really drive Nip/Tuck, while the incredibly realistic plastic surgery scenes will either help draw you in or completely repel you.  Over the course of these episodes, the characters are deconstructed more than one could ever think possible, but the great cast and twisty storytelling will keep you addicted.

She dreams of Ava, and Ava shows her what her life would have been like if she had married Christian instead of Sean.Christian, after discovering the baby Gina gave birth to isn't his biological child, decides that he loves the child anyway and wants to be a part of Wilbur's life.  Until Wilbur's real dad shows up.  Christian starts up an affair with blind patient Nastasha, but dumps Nastasha to get back together with Kimber.  After Wilbur is taken away from both Christian and Gina by the courts, Gina discovers she has AIDS.Two of the episodes introduce us to the work of The Carver, a prominent figure in upcoming Season Three.  The most powerful episode in this season has to be 'Rose And Raven Rosenberg', the story of a groundbreaking attempt to separate adult conjoined twins who share a brain.  This episode stars real life conjoined twins Lori and Reba Schappell, but of course the surgical procedures are FX.  The other two very moving episodes were #12 Julia McNamara in which Julia has her dream venture with Ava, and #16 Joan Rivers, the season finale, where Ava's big secret is let out of the bag, she's separated from her affair with Matt, and her own son dies.  ESCOBAR is back!!  He returns inside Sean's mind to give him strength to face The Carver.  Guest star is Alec Baldwin!The surgeries are more graphic this season.  Along with the fantastic conjoined twin surgery is a goopy eye implant, an experimental mutilation reversal, Mrs. Grubman's final lipo, a nose reconstruction after frostbite, a male boobjob, and The Carver's first strikes.  Just as in Season One, get ready to have some gruesome visuals set appropriately to great music.  Not since Michael Mann's 'Miami Vice' has a show been able to blend its visual and audio sensations as expertly as Nip/Tuck does.Yes, this is a dumb soap opera show, but I'm still addicted to it.  As long as you get past some of the lame dialogue and frustratingly stupid things the characters do, you should be able to relax and just accept it for what it is; glitzy and cheesy entertainment.

906150,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0009IW88K,trebe,"[0, 0]","The second season of FX's drama Nip/Tuck (2004) continues to explore the turbulent lives of Miami plastic surgeons Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) and Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh), as they take on more provocative cases.  Matching the edginess and raw sensuality of the first season, is a challenge that is not quite met.  The writing while very good, resembles something like a soap opera for most of the season, before ramping things up for a cliffhanger finish.  This season aired six years ago, and there are spoilers ahead, so proceed as you will.Holdover story elements from the initial season are followed up, as womanizing playboy Christian has become a father to his ex-girlfriend Gina Russo's (Jessalyn Gilsig) baby boy Wilbur.  He can still be a cynical prick, but a more human side of Dr. Troy is on display, rather than just a superficial user of women.  When Wilbur's real father becomes involved (Georg Stanford Brown), there are unexpected consequences, when the child is lost in a custody battle.A massive upheaval occurs in the McNamara household, as Julia (Joely Richardson) learns that Christian is the real father of her seventeen year old son Matt (John Hensley), and not her husband Sean.  Matt becomes romantically involved with his life coach Ava (Famke Jansen).  When these explosive developments come to light, Julia is kicked out of the house, while Sean has a fling with Kimber (Kelly Carlson), one of Christian's ex-girlfriends.  Like Christian, Sean undergoes a radical transformation.  While he remains compassionate to his patients, and his plan to end his partnership with Christian fizzles, his consuming anger towards Julia, makes him quite ornery and vindictive, as he creates shockwaves throughout the season.With so much drama on the home front, happenings in the office, and the importance of the patients is somewhat diminished.  Aesthetician Liz Cruz (Roma Mafia) attempts to get pregnant by artificial means, but otherwise is mainly in the background.  The graphic presentation of various surgical procedures remains ""cutting edge"", but is becoming routine.  There isn't much time given to patients, and the surgical procedures and recoveries seem rushed.  Things are rather mundane, until the partners head up to New York to participate in a procedure to separate Siamese twins joined at the head.  Jenny O'Hara has a brief but very touching performance as a bereaved mother, as Sean and Christian reconcile their differences by sharing a prostitute.Famke Jansen is great in the role of Ava Moore, although the character is somewhat predictable, and written as a clich&eacute;.  The big twist at the end may not play out as expected, but that it is clear that something dramatic is coming for some time.  The most troubling character is Matt, portrayed by the then 27 year old John Hensley, who engages in some pretty eclectic behavior for a high schooler.  The writers too conveniently resolve a situation where Matt was involved in a hit and run, before plunging the teen into a relationship with the rather diabolical Ava.  Reality continues to be overstretched, as incest is mixed in, and Matt has plans to take Ava away to Paris (seriously???).Joey Slotnick reprises his role as Dr. Merril Bobolit, who despite having lost his license, illegally practices medicine and perform surgery under the influence of drugs.  A fatal surgical mishap is swept away much too easily, a trend that is much too common in season two, where various sticky situations just go away.  And is it really plausible that Christian is unaware of locking wheel nuts?The dark criminal element that was a huge factor in season one, begins to resurface with the appearance of a sadistic rapist called ""The Carver"", who slices open the cheeks of his victims.  Sean's efforts to patch up The Carver's victims, eventually makes him a target of violence, leading to a dramatic cliffhanger ending that sets the stage for the third season.  Robert LaSardo returns as the spirit of drug dealer Escobar Gallardo, to advise Sean to turn to violence.With their personal lives in a mess, the relationship between Sean and Christian is severely tested again, but still manages to hold together.  Nip/Tuck remains a very entertaining series in season two, with the focus on the family.  The outstanding ensemble cast continues to be terrific.  The writing is creative, and delivers some surprises, but it is not as strong, and there are signs of sloppiness and predictability.  The show has a very talented ensemble cast, with guest appearances by such notables as Jill Claybugh, Vanessa Redgrave, Rebecca Gayheart, Mary Page Keller, Joan Rivers, and Alec Baldwin.  It is a continuing disappointment that there are no commentary tracks or extended interviews with the stars of this outstanding drama.",4,"shows signs of predictability, but still very compelling

906153,AF73QTGI12G1G,B0009IW88K,"Vernon Tapalla ""DVD  Addict""","[4, 10]","The first season was BAM BAM BAM edge-of-my-seat, curl-up-in-bed, and cover-my-eyes sensational so I had tremendous expectations going into the second season.  It isn't what I expected.  Only a couple of episodes here are great, one of which is #9, ""Rose and Raven Rosenberg"".  In this, Sean and Christian's friendship is able to withstand its biggest crisis, but not before both end up in a threesome with a hooker, while one still loathes the other.  After that episode, it all seems to go downhill.  This season, the writers are comfortable enough with the characters to delve TOO much into their personal troubles, losing the show's shock-and-surprise value to a more run-of-the-mill primetime soap.  Focus should be on both doctors AND patients.  I couldn't help but notice the longer, over-extended scenes and gaps in dialogue almost as if to fill time.  A lot of these episodes are too SLOW!  What happened to the magic?  Season one had me transfixed the entire time.  Now it's just boring.  By the time the last episode revealed the secret that was supposed to shock and surprise, I was no longer interested.  The only saving grace, even if the writing suffered this season, is the acting.  Both leads showed broader range and depth, and have somehow managed to convincingly portray their multi-dimensional characters.  They are GREAT!!!  And Ms. Richardson, you continue to amaze me.  I love the way you hide your English accent.  You and your mother transcend acting.  You both BECOME the characters you play.  What is truly remarkable is the show's brilliant cast whose performances are both memorable and compelling.  If only because of these exceptional talents, I am already looking forward to the next season. :-)",3,KINDA LET DOWN,1126828800,"09 16, 2005",2005,1728,"['first', 'season', 'was', 'BAM', 'BAM', 'BAM', 'edge-of-my-seat', 'curl-up-in-bed', 'cover-my-eyes', 'sensational', 'had', 'tremendous', 'expectations', 'going', 'second', 'season', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'Only', 'couple', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'great', 'one', '9', 'Rose', 'Raven', 'Rosenberg', 'Sean', 'Christian', 'friendship', 'able', 'withstand', 'biggest', 'crisis', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'threesome', 'hooker', 'one', 'still', 'other', 'episode', 'go', 'downhill', 'season', 'writers', 'are', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'characters', 'delve', 'TOO', 'much', 'personal', 'troubles', 'losing', 'show', 'shock-and-surprise', 'value', 'more', 'run-of-the-mill', 'primetime', 'soap', 'Focus', 'should', 'be', 'doctors', 'patients', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'longer', 'over-extended', 'scenes', 'gaps', 'dialogue', 'almost', 'fill', 'time', 'lot', 'episodes', 'are', 'too', 'SLOW', 'What', 'happened', 'magic', 'Season', 'one', 'had', 'entire', 'time', 'Now', 'just', 'boring', 'time', 'last', 'episode', 'revealed', 'secret', 'was', 'supposed', 'shock', 'surprise', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'interested', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'even', 'writing', 'suffered', 'season', 'acting', 'showed', 'broader', 'range', 'depth', 'have', 'somehow', 'managed', 'convincingly', 'portray', 'multi-dimensional', 'characters', 'are', 'GREAT', 'Ms.', 'Richardson', 'continue', 'amaze', 'love', 'way', 'hide', 'English', 'accent', 'mother', 'transcend', 'acting', 'BECOME', 'characters', 'play', 'What', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'show', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'performances', 'are', 'memorable', 'compelling', 'only', 'exceptional', 'talents', 'am', 'already', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'season']",N/A

That the plastic surgeons have tons of money does not help them in the slightest and in a way, it hurts them.  Troy has slept with half the women in Miami by now but still cannot find true love and intimacy.Sean has a family and a nice home, but his relationships are in crisis and he has been assaulted in that beautiful home as well.I wonder how they will top all of this in Season 3.",5,"More nips, more tucks, more upheavals",1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,1084,"['provocative', 'sometimes', 'almost-soft-porn', 'series', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'Julia', 'truth', 'who', 'fathered', 'Matt', 'was', ""n't"", 'Sean', 'Julia', 'down', 'drinking', 'depression', 'Sean', 'threatened', 'serial', 'menace', 'Carver', 'Christian', 'little', 'boy', 'wanted', 'raise', 'Gina', 'later', 'HIV', 'crisis', 'Matt', 'taken', 'twisted', 'Ava', 'troubled', 'son', 'Adrian', 'attack', 'Carver', 'who', 'stepped', 'up', 'crimes', 'way', 'taunting', 'Troy/MacNamara', 'team.Often', 'show', 'mind', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'where', 'characters', 'have', 'only', 'brief', 'periods', 'happiness', 'other', 'terrible', 'event', 'plastic', 'surgeons', 'have', 'tons', 'money', 'not', 'help', 'slightest', 'way', 'Troy', 'slept', 'women', 'Miami', 'now', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'intimacy.Sean', 'family', 'nice', 'home', 'relationships', 'are', 'crisis', 'been', 'assaulted', 'beautiful', 'home', 'well.I', 'wonder', 'how', 'will', 'top', 'Season', '3']",N/A
