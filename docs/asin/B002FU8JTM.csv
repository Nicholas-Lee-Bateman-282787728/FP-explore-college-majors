By then,not only was this Fox's very first series,but the longest-running(later surpassed by still-going THE SIMPSONS). Here,Ed O'Neill,Katey Sagal,Christina Applegate,David Faustino,Amanda Bearse and latecomer Ted McGinley please their fans for one last season. Joining MWC enroute to television heaven is another long-running Emmy-winner,ABC's ROSEANNE(ironically,Roseanne Barr was originally chosen to play Sagal's role of Peggy Bundy). Post-MWC,O'Neill continued making theatrical and television films and guest-starred on one episode of Sagal's later sitcom 8 SIMPLE RULES. Applegate retuned to series television in fall 1998 for the short-lived JESSE and last year for SAMANTHA WHO?. Earlier this year,she was diagnosed with breast cancer and is reportedly functioning well. Faustino now owns and operates a nightclub in Los Angeles. Applegate even makes theatrical films today with various supporting and co-starring roles. In 2003,the MWC overall cast,including original cast member David Garrison,reunited for a TV special. That was not the first time the cast discussed their cherished moments and favorite episodes with each other. Long live the Bundys!

Yes, long before the Simpsons existed, Married with Children started in 1987 and put Fox on the map.  No sitcom since has even come close to this masterpiece.  Even the best today: Family Guy, doesn't even come close to the brilliance of this show.  For a show to outshine such greats as All in the Family, Sanford and Son, and Happy Days is saying something.  And no, the Simpsons doesn't even belong in the same league as Married with Children or Family Guy...period!!!  Al Bundy is far and away the greatest fictional character in TV history.  Not many shows can say they made it through 11 great seasons.  Some shows start off good with their first season or two and just stink afterwards.  Married with Children was magnificent from season 1 to season 11 with out question.  Any DVD collector should definitely have every season of the greatest sitcom ever in their library.

That said I have to disagree with some of you all when you say its one of them shows that doesnt have a moral to the story/series.1. Never Mess with a Bundy.2. No matter how hard you try, no matter how hard you fight or how much you struggle or strive 90-99% of the time: You...JUST...CANT...WIN! Unless Youre messing with a bundy then chances are greatly increased Like in ""What goes around came around"" one of the girls bud had a crush on in the past humiliated him, then she did it again but this time on stage at the prom and Kelly got revenge for him. Then when kelly is told to 'put out or get out' in a later episode Bud gets revenge for her and gives the guy measles I think it was. And What about the labor day Episode where the people in the next car tell Al to 'shut the hell up'? Free-way Brawl anyone?3. Also A bundy is a bundy's own worst enemy Like in the ""Bundyful Life Episodes"" They are happy with out me? Hell I wanna live then! Paybacks for them making me miserable my whole life! Seemed to be the Moral of that Story. And how about when Peggy Out-bowled Al? Or when Peggy swapped Kellys Jello for Home-Ec class that Al ate in the middle of the night, just so she could finally get her diploma even though Kelly got held back or had to go to Summer school?4. And there are alot of Food opportunities all around the house if you but look.....Toaster Leavins anyone? Hows about a Tang-wipe? Or Toothpaste sandwiches...so you can eat AND fight cavities at the same time.My favorite episodes would have to be (Not in any particular order): Rain Girl, We'll follow the sun, Married with Aliens, Wabbit Season, You better shop around, Route 666, The England episodes, Poppy's By the tree, You better watch out (Santa dies), Peggy and the Pirates (Cabin Boy-Girl lol!), Take my wife Please, How green was my apple, The Camping Episode (in season 3), Married with...Queen (Season 3), Hot off the grill, Who'll stop the rain?...And My Ultimate Favorite I think is the Episode where the Bundys have to play football in Hell to get out of Hell with Satan (Robert Englund ?spelling?) as the referee (I cant remember the name on that one but it was Hilarious!).Over all I loved the Bundys although the ""Seven"" episodes were kinda confusing/annoying? I remember how he, Seven, showed up but I dont rememeber about how/when he left. But it kinda threw off the dynamic in my oppinion, then again it was pretty ironic to see peggy doting on him when she never did for Bud or Kelly (Unless they were moving out of the house, another irony?). Like when the others just simply sneezed once and she threw them out so Seven wouldnt get sick...Loved the cast everyone was Great made me laugh till i cried. And I am sooo glad it was released on DVD although I was kind of disappointed when I think in Season 3 They changed the intro music. The Original was just classic Bundy. The new music does kind of fit cause it brings to mind a 3-ring circus But still I Liked the original much better.Anyway this is just my oppinion.Peace everyone, Cyn",4,Married with Children,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,3055,"['Love', 'Bundys', 'said', 'have', 'disagree', 'when', 'say', 'one', 'doesnt', 'have', 'moral', 'story/series.1', 'Never', 'Mess', 'Bundy.2', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'fight', 'how', 'much', 'struggle', 'strive', '90-99', '%', 'time', 'JUST', 'CANT', 'WIN', 'Unless', 'Youre', 'messing', 'bundy', 'then', 'chances', 'are', 'greatly', 'increased', 'What', 'around', 'came', 'one', 'girls', 'bud', 'had', 'crush', 'past', 'humiliated', 'then', 'did', 'again', 'time', 'stage', 'prom', 'Kelly', 'got', 'revenge', 'Then', 'when', 'kelly', 'told', ""'put"", 'out', 'get', 'out', 'later', 'episode', 'Bud', 'revenge', 'guy', 'think', 'was', 'What', 'labor', 'day', 'Episode', 'where', 'people', 'next', 'car', 'tell', 'Al', ""'shut"", 'hell', 'up', 'Free-way', 'Brawl', 'anyone', '3', 'Also', 'bundy', 'bundy', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'Bundyful', 'Life', 'Episodes', 'are', 'happy', 'Hell', 'wan', 'na', 'live', 'then', 'Paybacks', 'making', 'miserable', 'whole', 'life', 'Seemed', 'be', 'Moral', 'Story', 'how', 'about', 'when', 'Peggy', 'Out-bowled', 'Al', 'when', 'Peggy', 'swapped', 'Kellys', 'Jello', 'Home-Ec', 'class', 'Al', 'ate', 'middle', 'night', 'just', 'could', 'finally', 'get', 'diploma', 'even', 'Kelly', 'got', 'held', 'back', 'had', 'go', 'Summer', 'school', '4', 'are', 'alot', 'Food', 'opportunities', 'house', 'look', '..Toaster', 'anyone', 'Tang-wipe', 'Toothpaste', 'sandwiches', 'so', 'can', 'eat', 'fight', 'cavities', 'same', 'time.My', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Not', 'particular', 'order', 'Rain', 'Girl', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'sun', 'Married', 'Aliens', 'Wabbit', 'Season', 'better', 'shop', 'Route', '666', 'England', 'episodes', 'Poppy', 'tree', 'better', 'watch', 'out', 'Santa', 'Peggy', 'Pirates', 'Cabin', 'Boy-Girl', 'lol', 'Take', 'wife', 'Please', 'How', 'green', 'was', 'apple', 'Camping', 'Episode', 'season', '3', 'Married', 'Queen', 'Season', '3', 'Hot', 'grill', 'Who', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'rain', 'Ultimate', 'Favorite', 'think', 'Episode', 'where', 'Bundys', 'have', 'play', 'football', 'Hell', 'get', 'Hell', 'Satan', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'spelling', 'referee', 'cant', 'remember', 'name', 'one', 'was', 'Hilarious', 'loved', 'Bundys', 'Seven', 'episodes', 'were', 'kinda', 'confusing/annoying', 'remember', 'how', 'Seven', 'showed', 'dont', 'rememeber', 'how/when', 'left', 'kinda', 'threw', 'off', 'dynamic', 'oppinion', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'pretty', 'ironic', 'see', 'peggy', 'doting', 'when', 'never', 'did', 'Bud', 'Kelly', 'were', 'moving', 'house', 'irony', 'when', 'others', 'just', 'simply', 'sneezed', 'once', 'threw', 'out', 'so', 'Seven', 'wouldnt', 'get', 'sick', 'Loved', 'cast', 'everyone', 'was', 'Great', 'made', 'till', 'i', 'cried', 'am', 'sooo', 'glad', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'kind', 'disappointed', 'when', 'think', 'Season', '3', 'changed', 'intro', 'music', 'Original', 'was', 'just', 'classic', 'Bundy', 'new', 'music', 'kind', 'fit', 'cause', 'mind', '3-ring', 'circus', 'still', 'Liked', 'original', 'much', 'better.Anyway', 'just', 'oppinion.Peace', 'everyone', 'Cyn']",N/A

If anyone notices anyedits for music issues please POST. I disagree that MWC only got betterwith age. It did not. I thought the departure of STEVE RHOADES sent theseries into a balance issue between trying to be a show with a socialmessage and  topics ALL men could relate to into nothingmore than a glorified COMIC BOOK. There were many'Changing of the Guard' moments over the years on MWC suchas the creators (MOYE and LEAVITT) departing, followedsoon after by Chief Writer/producer Ellen Fogle.Most of the original writers were long gone by Season 7.Al changed from a sort of ""goofy"" obsessed  middle agedman who did outrageous things in a very comicalcan't help but love him way. Who can forget AL buildinghis own bathroom, sitting on his own FERGUSON, andbattling that mean old lady in the Library (You'reA Bad Seed Bundy""). Such great memories. By the timeall the original writers and producers moved on toother things, AL BUNDY had changed into a sort of BULLYof a guy, who used (comic) Violence to make his point.The original AL BUNDY wasn't a violent man, he wasa bespoke, miserable, yet lovable guy. Later Al Bundypersonna is much angrier and dumber (if that's even possible).Still the final season is worth having.There are a few good episodes.  I admit it.I don't HATE any season.But I still say the first  5 seasonsMADE the show legendery, the final 5just ran on FUMES of the original concept.When BUCK was replaced by A DIFFERENT dog(Lucky) I knew the show I was watchingand loved..WAS GONE.

1266860,A3A6O7SC8LKXDL,B002FU8JTM,EPA316,"[1, 1]","This season has a lot of good episodes. My favorite of this season was the 3-part ""Breaking up is easy to do"" which shows Al and Peg separating. It answered the question I have had for a while, which is, why doesn't Al just get a divorce? The answer is that deep, deep down, he really loves Peg. But you won't hear him say it. We see he really is attracted to Peg when she seduces him as a stripper, although he doesn't know it's her until the end of the episode. There is also an interesting peek at what might have been if he and Marcy had gotten along, when her ""identical cousin"" shows up, and she and Al strike up a friendship.Now, don't misunderstand this, because I feel that Married With Children is hands-down the best sitcom ever, but.. this final season has some episodes that just aren't that good. Some episodes that were particularly below average were when Al, Griff and Jefferson join the National Guard, and when Bud's prison-pal girlfriend holds the family hostage. I could tell that it seemed like they were running out of good ideas, so maybe it's for the best that MWC ended when it did.In the end, there will never be another show like this one. You know this is a classic show when the networks are still comparing their new shows to this one. Any fan of sitcoms should have all 11 seasons on dvd. My personal method for maximum enjoyment of this show sounds strange, but it works. Don't watch it every day. Watch it only once or twice a year, if even that much. The reason for that is the shows stay fresh if you don't have them memorized. So, farewell to the best tv comedy ever.

The Cosby Show and Full House have failed to bring a large amount of humor in all of their episodes, but almost every single episode of Married...with Children really made me laugh. Yeah, the jokers are crude and politically incorrect, but I love it. This is a very raunchy show, and it never takes itself very seriously. But while this eleventh (and final) season is still hilarious, it seems like some of the jokes have been recycled from earlier episodes. They aren't as effective as they were a few seasons back.

David Faustino should get kudos as well as his portrayal of Bud; for a character who supposedly doesn't get the babes, he gets more than his share from Al's boss Gary...actress Janet Carroll (Gary) finally gets to show us how hot she is this season!And then there's the old ""Ginger or Mary Ann"" argument regarding Peggy and Kelly; my circle of buddies usually choose Peggy - Katey Sagal looks slimmer and tighter in this eleventh season that'll make Kelly voters switch.....Not many TV characters make me laugh out loud...but Ed's Al Bundy does. Would I want to live next door to an Al Bundy? Or have an Al Bundy in my family? Or be like Al Bundy? Heck no! He's devilish, crude, crass, selfish, trashy, insulting and smells bad. So what makes us love and root for this guy? Is it because he says things we wish we could? Or that he's an underdog?

In this final season, Al (Ed O'Neill) is held hostage by a group of angry fat women who accuses him of being prejudice against the obese. Peg (Katey Segal) suffers amnesia and becomes Al's ideal housewife. Kelly (Christina Applegate) tries to abstain from having sex in order to play a nun for a TV commercial. Bud (David Faustino) lowers his standards on picking up women and starts dating Al's boss Gary. Marcy (Amanda Bearse) becomes jealous when Jefferson (Ted McGinley) gets too much attention in the health club. ""Married... with Children"" is the long-running FOX comedy sitcom that changed our view of the typical family comedy. The eleventh season suffered a significant drop in viewers due to constant timeslot changes. Adding the rising production costs, the comedy series was cancelled without a big finale episode. Despite a few standout episodes (Twisted, Kelly's Gotta Habit, Crimes against Obesity & Damn Bundys), the final season is certainly not one of the show's best.""Married... with Children"" The Complete Eleventh Season is a considerable letdown to one of the funniest comedy sitcoms from the Fox Network.

That's what makes Married With Children so hysterically funny. Poor, beleaguered shoe salesman Al Bundy, has much to contend with in life. There's his terminally tacky, oversexed wife Peg. Not to mention Al's slutty daughter Kelly, and smart-Aleck son, Bud. And the world around Al has changed, much to his dismay. Al is still stuck in a Neanderthal male mentality, especially with regards to women's rights. He's like a modern-day Archie Bunker, who is unable, or unwilling to adjust to contemporary society as it is.Ed O'Neil played Al with a smug, male-chauvinist-pig relish. Katy Segal as Peg, lit-up the screen with her own bawdy charisma. Together, they had a crackling comedic chemistry between them. The supporting cast, certainly augmented the loose-cannon hilarity of this show. But Ed O'Neil and Katy Segal, were the center that held this show together, during it's long run on TV.

1266874,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B002FU8JTM,Twiddles42,"[11, 11]","The final year is a step up from the last few years, which descended into total vapid crudity.Now, the final year also retains crudity that ""Married with Children"" (MWC) is known for, yet plot quality has risen (the jokes aren't as obvious and even when the punchline is, there are enough instances where you don't get the set-up until after the groundwork has been laid), and goes new places/tackles new ideas.  For example:* ""The Stepford Peg"" - Peggy gets amnesia and Al trains Peggy to serve him 24 hours a day (literally).  Rating:  5-stars* ""Grime and Punishment"" - Bud lands some money and Al now demands rent.  Unfortunate, Bud being the smart one, knows renters' rights and calls in the authorities.  Hilarity really does ensue.  5-stars* ""Kelly's Gotta Habit"" - Bud gets Kelly in for a product ad commercial, but has to clean up her wardrobe and act (not being ""easy"") in order to get the role.  Another 5-star ep.* ""Bud on the Side"" - Bud, eyed by Al's boss, go into a relationship - much to the initial chagrin of Al, until his boss starts furnishing the shoe store with a large TV and beer.  Obviously a total farce, but is remarkably funny (and, of course, crude).  Another 5-star winner.* ""Crimes against Obesity"" - not a clip show as such; most of the women Al has insulted over the years make a return visit.  Definitely not PC, but this one too had me rolling:  5 stars.* ""A Babe in Toyland"" - Kelly is hired to host a children's show when the existing host is axed.  The subplot between Al and Peggy still has me rolling too.  Oh, this is a top-notch episode.  5 stars, obviously! :)* ""D*mn Bundys"" - (episode title is not censored on the DVD case).  Al makes a deal with the Devil so he can play on a NFL football team.  The 3D gimmick FOX ran is so-so but the overall episode still, like the others I've mentioned, show the show has a LOT of life left in it.  Or at least has a second wind... (I will also bypass the obvious pun...)* ""Lez Be Friends"" - Marcy's identical cousin arrives and comes out to Al.  Great acting by all involved.  Note, this episode originally aired 20 days before ""Ellen"" did a GLBT-themed episode too.  MWC got there first.  (And both shows were great in what they wanted to do.)  Rating: 5 stars.Now, the funny thing with this final year is, some stories (e.g. ""Grime and Punishment"") take place in 'the present' - meaning the actors act their physical ages.  Other stories, (e.g. ""Crimes and Obesity"") have the kids acting like they were in season 1.  Okay, David Faustino and Christina Applegate are a decade older, and despite being veteran actors, I can't believe they're playing 13- and 15-year olds because they obviously look mid-20s.  No amount of acting will overcome that particular barrier.  The shows are still funny, but that pesky ""looks"" issue cannot be avoided.FOX, with the final year, kept moving the airdate from its original comfy Sunday line-up to Saturday.  And then to other days.  And not always advertising.  I'm not sure ""The Stepford Peg"" ever got aired; likely due to a football game going overtime...  Usually that's a big sign a network wants to axe a program, by moving the time slot (which was initially advertised with Al mimicking John Travolta and Saturday Night Fever, of course) but then quietly made other changes.  I was hooked with this season early on, which was amazing given how the series turned empty for the last 3 years.  I can't pinpoint the entire WHY, but there is a freshness in the stories, some of which hark back to the series' roots.Oh, the Kelly marriage episode and the 3-parter where Al and Peg split up are the obligatory clunker episodes.At least it ended on a high note, albeit with an episode that didn't air ""Chicago Shoe Exchange"" as FOX promoted Kelly's marriage to be the final episode.  A final episode that didn't feel like a finale in any sense...Definitely a must-have set for fans, even those who gave up on the show after season 5.  This one readily eclipses seasons 5-10 in terms of laughs.",5,"Going back to the basics, but all for nothing...",1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,4012,"['final', 'year', 'step', 'up', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'descended', 'total', 'vapid', 'crudity.Now', 'final', 'year', 'also', 'crudity', 'Married', 'Children', 'MWC', 'known', 'yet', 'plot', 'quality', 'risen', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'even', 'when', 'punchline', 'are', 'enough', 'instances', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'set-up', 'groundwork', 'been', 'laid', 'new', 'places/tackles', 'new', 'ideas', 'example', '*', 'Stepford', 'Peg', 'Peggy', 'amnesia', 'Al', 'trains', 'Peggy', 'serve', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'literally', 'Rating', '5-stars*', 'Grime', 'Punishment', 'Bud', 'money', 'Al', 'now', 'rent', 'Unfortunate', 'Bud', 'being', 'smart', 'one', 'renters', 'rights', 'calls', 'authorities', 'Hilarity', 'really', 'ensue', '5-stars*', 'Kelly', 'Got', 'ta', 'Habit', 'Bud', 'Kelly', 'product', 'ad', 'commercial', 'clean', 'up', 'wardrobe', 'act', 'not', 'being', 'easy', 'order', 'get', 'role', '5-star', 'ep', '*', 'Bud', 'Side', 'Bud', 'eyed', 'Al', 'boss', 'go', 'relationship', 'much', 'initial', 'chagrin', 'Al', 'boss', 'furnishing', 'shoe', 'store', 'large', 'TV', 'beer', 'Obviously', 'total', 'farce', 'remarkably', 'funny', 'course', 'crude', '5-star', 'winner', '*', 'Crimes', 'Obesity', 'not', 'clip', 'show', 'such', 'most', 'women', 'Al', 'insulted', 'years', 'make', 'return', 'visit', 'Definitely', 'not', 'PC', 'one', 'too', 'had', 'rolling', '5', 'stars', '*', 'Babe', 'Toyland', 'Kelly', 'hired', 'host', 'children', 'show', 'when', 'existing', 'host', 'axed', 'subplot', 'Al', 'Peggy', 'still', 'rolling', 'too', 'Oh', 'top-notch', 'episode', '5', 'stars', 'obviously', '*', 'D*mn', 'Bundys', 'episode', 'title', 'not', 'censored', 'DVD', 'case', 'Al', 'deal', 'Devil', 'can', 'play', 'NFL', 'football', 'team', '3D', 'gimmick', 'FOX', 'ran', 'so-so', 'overall', 'episode', 'still', 'others', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'show', 'show', 'LOT', 'life', 'left', 'least', 'second', 'wind', 'will', 'also', 'bypass', 'obvious', 'pun', '*', 'Lez', 'Be', 'Friends', 'Marcy', 'identical', 'cousin', 'arrives', 'out', 'Al', 'Great', 'acting', 'involved', 'Note', 'episode', 'originally', 'aired', '20', 'days', 'Ellen', 'did', 'GLBT-themed', 'episode', 'too', 'MWC', 'got', 'there', 'first', 'shows', 'were', 'great', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'Rating', '5', 'stars.Now', 'funny', 'thing', 'final', 'year', 'stories', 'e.g', 'Grime', 'Punishment', 'take', 'place', ""'the"", 'present', 'meaning', 'actors', 'act', 'physical', 'ages', 'Other', 'stories', 'e.g', 'Crimes', 'Obesity', 'have', 'kids', 'acting', 'were', 'season', '1', 'Okay', 'David', 'Faustino', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'are', 'decade', 'older', 'being', 'veteran', 'actors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'re"", 'playing', '13-', '15-year', 'olds', 'obviously', 'look', 'mid-20s', 'amount', 'acting', 'will', 'overcome', 'particular', 'barrier', 'shows', 'are', 'still', 'funny', 'pesky', 'looks', 'issue', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'avoided.FOX', 'final', 'year', 'kept', 'moving', 'airdate', 'original', 'comfy', 'Sunday', 'line-up', 'Saturday', 'then', 'other', 'days', 'not', 'always', 'advertising', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Stepford', 'Peg', 'ever', 'got', 'aired', 'likely', 'due', 'football', 'game', 'going', 'overtime', 'Usually', 'big', 'sign', 'network', 'axe', 'program', 'moving', 'time', 'slot', 'was', 'initially', 'advertised', 'Al', 'mimicking', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'course', 'then', 'quietly', 'made', 'other', 'changes', 'was', 'hooked', 'season', 'early', 'was', 'amazing', 'given', 'how', 'series', 'turned', 'empty', 'last', '3', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pinpoint', 'entire', 'WHY', 'freshness', 'stories', 'hark', 'back', 'series', 'roots.Oh', 'Kelly', 'marriage', 'episode', '3-parter', 'where', 'Al', 'Peg', 'split', 'up', 'are', 'obligatory', 'clunker', 'episodes.At', 'least', 'ended', 'high', 'note', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'air', 'Chicago', 'Shoe', 'Exchange', 'FOX', 'promoted', 'Kelly', 'marriage', 'be', 'final', 'episode', 'final', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'finale', 'sense', 'Definitely', 'must-have', 'set', 'fans', 'even', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'show', 'season', '5', 'one', 'readily', 'seasons', '5-10', 'terms', 'laughs']",N/A
