1574551,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B008RAAIDO,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[1, 1]","I love French films. They are the masters of tension and depraved themes artfully brought to life onscreen. However, the story line revolves around a subject that, for me, struggles to maintain effective tension. The conflict is neutral, its not personal, or even idiosyncratic. Its commerce, conducted matter of factly, and the captors usually have a huge advantage over the captives. There are only 2 possibilities open at any time: escape or die. The escape scenes are predictable usually, and don't carry surprise or suspense. The ending is typically predictable as well. So, for that, the subject matter is inherently limited in its ability to get me into the 'zone' that I much love in horror, and even the French films that usually very capably get me into it. The technical aspects of this one were solid, except the sound effect of the barking dogs was waaayyyyy overdone and really grated very quickly. The inherent conflict between the main protagonist and dogs was telegraphed early on too. It was overkill. Acting was fine, very good in fact. The production values were solid. I would definitely watch a future endeavor of these filmmakers even though this one fell a little flat for me.",3,Horror Junkie's review: 3.5 to 4 in terms of quality but just didn't hook me,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,1200,"['love', 'French', 'films', 'are', 'masters', 'tension', 'depraved', 'themes', 'artfully', 'brought', 'life', 'onscreen', 'However', 'story', 'line', 'subject', 'maintain', 'effective', 'tension', 'conflict', 'neutral', 'not', 'personal', 'even', 'idiosyncratic', 'commerce', 'conducted', 'matter', 'factly', 'captors', 'usually', 'have', 'huge', 'advantage', 'captives', 'are', 'only', '2', 'possibilities', 'open', 'time', 'escape', 'die', 'escape', 'scenes', 'are', 'predictable', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'carry', 'surprise', 'suspense', 'ending', 'typically', 'predictable', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'subject', 'matter', 'inherently', 'limited', 'ability', 'get', ""'zone"", 'much', 'love', 'horror', 'even', 'French', 'films', 'usually', 'very', 'capably', 'get', 'technical', 'aspects', 'one', 'were', 'solid', 'sound', 'effect', 'barking', 'dogs', 'was', 'waaayyyyy', 'overdone', 'really', 'grated', 'very', 'quickly', 'inherent', 'conflict', 'main', 'protagonist', 'dogs', 'was', 'telegraphed', 'early', 'too', 'was', 'overkill', 'Acting', 'was', 'fine', 'very', 'good', 'fact', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'solid', 'would', 'definitely', 'watch', 'future', 'endeavor', 'filmmakers', 'even', 'one', 'fell', 'little', 'flat']",N/A

1574553,AIG0FOVXY7ZSN,B008RAAIDO,Len Stoner,"[1, 2]","There's nothing really new here.  It's an abduction movie where 3 adults take a wrong turn, get lost, and encounter a gang who capture them.  They are held in cells in a basement.  One attempts an escape, which goes wrong for him.  When a phone rings, one of the abductors answers and gets instructions about something. Then they select one of the captives and drags them to an unseen room away from the other captives.  The captive never returns. Alive, that is.  As they await their fate, one of them manages to escape and discover what's going on. The captive discovers a way out for all of them and manages to free the remaining two captives.  They make their way to the woods before the escape is discovered by the gang.  Mayhem insues.  Do they escape?  Maybe, maybe not.  I don't think I'd pay to find out, but if you can get it for free, it's worth a watch.",3,Ok Movie,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,865,"['nothing', 'really', 'new', 'here', 'abduction', 'movie', 'where', '3', 'adults', 'take', 'wrong', 'turn', 'get', 'lost', 'encounter', 'gang', 'who', 'capture', 'are', 'held', 'cells', 'basement', 'One', 'escape', 'wrong', 'When', 'phone', 'rings', 'one', 'abductors', 'answers', 'instructions', 'something', 'Then', 'select', 'one', 'captives', 'drags', 'unseen', 'room', 'away', 'other', 'captives', 'captive', 'never', 'returns', 'Alive', 'await', 'fate', 'one', 'escape', 'discover', 'what', 'going', 'captive', 'discovers', 'way', 'manages', 'free', 'remaining', 'two', 'captives', 'make', 'way', 'woods', 'escape', 'discovered', 'gang', 'Mayhem', 'insues', 'Do', 'escape', 'Maybe', 'maybe', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'pay', 'find', 'out', 'can', 'get', 'free', 'watch']",N/A
