1049497,A2TPAK9RWIM22T,B000MQCUKU,Kenneth Potter,"[11, 13]","I have a large collection of Christian movies, and I especially like David White & Brad Heller.  The Moment After is my favorite rapture movie, hands down.  Unfortunately, however, part 2 is just awful.  I truly love most Christian movies, but this is so poor.  The violence is just disgusting.  It seems as if the movie was created to be disturbing just for the sake of being disturbing.",1,Extremely disappointing after the first,1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,388,"['have', 'large', 'collection', 'Christian', 'movies', 'especially', 'David', 'White', 'Brad', 'Heller', 'Moment', 'favorite', 'rapture', 'movie', 'down', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'part', '2', 'just', 'awful', 'truly', 'love', 'most', 'Christian', 'movies', 'so', 'poor', 'violence', 'just', 'disgusting', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'be', 'disturbing', 'just', 'sake', 'being', 'disturbing']",The Moment After 2: The Awakening

Some of the transitions are choppy and don't flow well but, even though the sequence isn't always clear, the gist of the plot comes through. I liked the acting and the strong messages throughout the movie. I loved the part where the actor said, ""I may have to do this again tomorrow"". I think most of us can relate to that, and thank God that His mercy is new every day for that very reason. It definitely left loose ends, so there has to be a ""Moment After 3"" at some point.

It's been awhile since I bought this for my private home collection, but have enjoyed all that David A.R. White has done over recent years. He gets better with age and experience, not only as an actor but as a film-maker (under PureFlix movies). Both he and his wife are in many of the most recent movies he's filmed and I've not been disappointed in any of them these past 7 years. There are some with Kevin and Bobby Downes in them you will also enjoy!",4,The Moment After 2: The Awakening,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,532,"['was', 'sequel', 'Moment', 'David', 'A.R', 'White', 'Kevin', 'Downes', 'been', 'awhile', 'bought', 'private', 'home', 'collection', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'David', 'A.R', 'White', 'done', 'recent', 'years', 'better', 'age', 'experience', 'not', 'only', 'actor', 'film-maker', 'PureFlix', 'movies', 'wife', 'are', 'many', 'most', 'recent', 'movies', 'filmed', ""'ve"", 'not', 'been', 'disappointed', '7', 'years', 'are', 'Kevin', 'Bobby', 'Downes', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy']",The Moment After 2: The Awakening

It started out OK, but then got bogged down and kinda fizzled.  Very few, if any, special effects, just didn't seem to have much to say.  Not only that, they left everything up in the air, I guess so they HAVE to make part 3!  I just hope part 3 will not dissapoint like this one did.
