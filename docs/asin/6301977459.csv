Others should give the film a wide berth which should be easy to do as ownership complications with the music rights continue to keep this interesting counter-culture film from a DVD release.The title comes from a statement made by a Columbia University administrator in response to student demands for more say in the administrative decisions of school.  He said something to the effect that the opinions of the students meant no more to him than whether they liked the taste of strawberries.  Needless to say this simply played into the hands of the most radical of the students and became a rallying cry for the protests that would rock the university.The film transports the events from NYC to a fictional university in San Francisco, at least in part because ""The City By the Bay"" was quick to offer its location to film makers; even though the area had its own considerable student protest legacy (The Free Speech Movement, The Oakland 7, and People's' Park come to mind).Taking its character motivational elements and cinematography style from Haskell Wexler's  ""Medium Cool""  (1969); it is all about a ""Man With A Movie Camera""  (1929) observer gradually being pulled through his lens into the action itself.  A little broken camera symbolism.  In both there is a surprisingly authentic feeling romance, which serves as both a tension release and as a source of character motivation.The action he has been observing is essentially a ""Hellbound Train Effect"" as the young students aggressively test the system and the authorities stubbornly refuse to defuse the situation.The film includes a great period soundtrack which I owned before I had even seen the movie.  The songs nicely complement what you are seeing on the screen.  Neil Young's ""The Loner"" gets an especially good montage effect.  Joni Mitchell's ""The Circle Game"" (sung by Buffy Sainte-Marie) bookends the film and the morphing of the hero (played by Bruce Davison) from distanced jock (crew team) to involved student.There is a curious foreshadowing of Davison's signature role in ""Willard"", a film he made just a year after ""The Strawberry Statement"".  Instead of conversations with a house of rats he talks to the cockroaches in his kitchen.  There is probably a metaphor there but just exactly what it is escapes me.Then again, what do I know?

286425,A2KNX6Y72E1FVJ,6301977459,"V. Risoli ""black farmer""","[2, 5]","""The Strawberry Statement"" (1970) is a well edited college campus unrest film that in comparison to another like it in its day, Michaelangelo Antonioni's ""Zabriskie Point"" makes the famed Italian director's supposed ""misfire"" with critics and audiences seem like a ""masterpiece.""  ""The Strawberry Statement"", based on a book  by James Kunen is so unbelievable and mindless at times it dissolves into being boring despite the editing and musical soundtrack of then current songs, a lot by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Neil Young and others.  The characters are not well developed and are uninteresting (the leads are played by Bruce Davison and Kim Darby, both who were better in other things and not very box office).  Others in the cast are James Coco and Bud Cort, both wasted.  The dialogue and plot are insipid.  The script by Israel Horowitz does not make sense, especially the plot.  It is totally unbelievable and contrived to appear ""with it.""  The film was directed by Stuart Hagmann.  It is very disappointing that at such a time as it was in 1970, and the direction Hollywood was going for its new generation of film-goers, such an uninteresting and dull film could come out of M-G-M, too (as was ""Zabriskie Point""), that totally could not capture the vitality and involvement of the ""movement"" it tried to depict.  Included in Warner Archive's re-mastered edition is a second disc with the extended international version with additional footage.
