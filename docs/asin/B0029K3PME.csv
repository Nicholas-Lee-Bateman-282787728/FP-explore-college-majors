1256852,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0029K3PME,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Leaving Barstow does absolutely nothing particularly flashy. I mean, it's not a film stacked with special effects, wild storyline twists, or anything of that nature. Instead, what makes Leaving Barstow succeed is the fact it tells such a simple, likeable story.In fact, another reason the movie is so great is the way many of us can probably relate to the young teenager who plays the main character.He desperately wants to leave home (and town altogether) but the love he has for his mother and his friends (and a girl he meets at a restaurant where his mother works) makes leaving a VERY difficult decision. How many of us were in the same situation at some point in time? Most of us were.My favorite part of the storyline are the scenes showing the teenager trying to deal with his mothers new boyfriend.  The boyfriend is seriously only a few years older than the mothers son, haha.  This means the son has a serious problem with him and constantly questions his every move.Anyway, the atmosphere is exceptionally quiet and the storyline is definitely on the simple and straightforward side, but none of that interferes with the amount of enjoyment this movie supplies to the viewers. You will understand every single event that takes place (well, except maybe the part dealing with the school teacher who suddenly dies- I think this part of the story could have given us more because I was curious what really happened there).Anyway, the acting is solid, the storyline is enjoyable, and the film just works.

I was just searching through the schedule for Showtime on TV earlier this week and ran across this movie. I read the short synopsis and decided to record it. After watching it tonight, I'm surprised at how good the film was. Leaving Barstow (2008) is an indie written by young actor Kevin Sheridan and directed by actor Peter Paige. I think what's so appealing about this movie is how low key the production is. It looks and feels like everyday life in a small crappy town like Barstow. But the movie is very well written, acted and photographed. So while it may look like a low budget indie, it doesn't have the often times lame story and acting of a low budget movie.The story is simply about this 18-year old guy named Andrew who is finishing high school in a dead end town. He's living with his widowed mother Sandra, who's dating a 22-year old country-rock singer named Cody. There's obviously some tension between Andrew and Cody since Cody is only a few years older than Andrew and he's sleeping with Andrew's mother...on the other side of Andrew's bedroom wall. But the real story here is Andrew figuring out what he wants to do with his life. Does he stay in this nowhere town and keep his lonely mother company? Or does he leave for college and start a new life for himself?Actor Steven Culp, who I absolutely loved in Thirteen Days (2000), plays one of Andrew's high school teachers. It's a small supporting role, but he packs a punch with his few minutes on screen. This film was obviously overlooked and poorly distributed when it came out two years ago. But I'm certainly glad to have discovered it on Showtime this week. If you like character-driven dramas, then check this film out on Showtime or DVD. I think we can all relate to the characters in this movie from some period in our lives. The photography was well done, with some cool compositions...even though there seemed to be a lot of ""ass"" shots and blurry montages. I give the film 3 out of 5 stars. It's a good late night flick.",3,Pure Accident,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,2072,"['now', 'then', 'come', 'gem', 'movie', 'pure', 'accident', 'was', 'just', 'searching', 'schedule', 'Showtime', 'TV', 'earlier', 'week', 'ran', 'movie', 'read', 'short', 'synopsis', 'decided', 'record', 'watching', 'tonight', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'Leaving', 'Barstow', '2008', 'indie', 'written', 'young', 'actor', 'Kevin', 'Sheridan', 'directed', 'actor', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'think', 'what', 'so', 'appealing', 'movie', 'how', 'low', 'key', 'production', 'feels', 'everyday', 'life', 'small', 'crappy', 'town', 'Barstow', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'photographed', 'So', 'may', 'look', 'low', 'budget', 'indie', ""n't"", 'have', 'often', 'lame', 'story', 'acting', 'low', 'budget', 'movie.The', 'story', 'simply', '18-year', 'old', 'guy', 'named', 'Andrew', 'who', 'finishing', 'high', 'school', 'dead', 'end', 'town', 'living', 'widowed', 'mother', 'Sandra', 'who', 'dating', '22-year', 'old', 'country-rock', 'singer', 'named', 'Cody', 'obviously', 'tension', 'Andrew', 'Cody', 'Cody', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'older', 'Andrew', 'sleeping', 'Andrew', 'mother', 'other', 'side', 'Andrew', 'bedroom', 'wall', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'Andrew', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'stay', 'nowhere', 'town', 'keep', 'lonely', 'mother', 'company', 'leave', 'college', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'Actor', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'who', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Thirteen', 'Days', '2000', 'one', 'Andrew', 'high', 'school', 'teachers', 'small', 'supporting', 'role', 'punch', 'few', 'minutes', 'screen', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'overlooked', 'poorly', 'distributed', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'two', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'glad', 'have', 'discovered', 'Showtime', 'week', 'like', 'character-driven', 'dramas', 'then', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'Showtime', 'DVD', 'think', 'can', 'relate', 'characters', 'movie', 'period', 'lives', 'photography', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'cool', 'compositions', 'even', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'lot', 'ass', 'shots', 'blurry', 'montages', 'give', 'film', '3', '5', 'stars', 'good', 'late', 'night', 'flick']",Leaving Barstow

1256855,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0029K3PME,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[10, 11]","Leaving Barstow is another independent film that will either inspire quickly or leave you cold. Chances are you will sympathize with the lead character, Andrew.The movie is told from high school senior Andrew's point of view. The story is fairly straightforward; Andrew has to grow up for many reasons. He is dealt a hand of pretty bad cards, and is forced to do his best at being happy. One after another we meet the people that affect his life, his physics teacher, the midnight radio DJ, his best friend Carlos, his mother and her boyfriends, the restaurant owner, and, the very important, Jenny. They all have a strong impact on Andrew's life, positive and negative.I felt a strong sense of claustrophobia, imprisonment, and resignation in this film. Andrew lives with his single mother, battling her own demons. There is an implied almost sexual relationship between Andrew and his mother, adding to Andrew's sense of being trapped in Barstow, California. She became pregnant very young, chose to keep her son, and the father is not around. She happens to like and date boys close to her son's age. Andrew and his friend Carlos keep close to each other at school; they are not part of any popular crowd. Carlos is a great friend; he wants nothing but good for Andrew.This was not an expensive production. There are only a few spartan sets. This film is a character study, and the sparseness is appropriate. The acting was quite good. Oddly the one character that I did not care for and felt was over acted, was the one actor with a long television resume, the physics teacher played by Steven Culp. The mother was just exactly the right level of self indulgence. Andrew played by Kevin Sheridan (mostly television career, Veronica Mars and American Dreams) was remarkable. He played the introverted, quiet, intelligent, kind high school boy.Pacing was just about right. The director knew when to move along quickly and leave out the 100 details most directors would include; and when to include the subtle detailed moments. The ending is wonderful, up until the last 10 minutes, I still didn't know if Andrew was going to leave or not; but I wanted to shout at the screen, get out of there Andrew. Camera work is simple and competent. There is a grittiness to the film, physically and thematically. Dialog is well recorded and clear.The film is not rated, and is probably somewhere between PG-13 and R rated. It seems appropriate for all high school students. Given the noises from the mother's bedroom and discussions about  [...] and erections, younger viewers probably shouldn't see this film. I don't remember any nudity. There is no violence. And I don't remember much strong language. It's the themes that make this a more mature film.The DVD is sparse. The bonus features are a series of interviews. The first with the director Peter Paige is decent; he does give some insight into why he took on this project. The second is with Kevin Sheridan, who played Andrew and was the script writer. This surprised me, I really liked the fact that Kevin wrote this movie and then stars in it. The last interviews are not good. An interview with Michelle Clunie who played the mother, is just so bad. The interview is an actress telling us all about the character she plays, it is not at all revealing, nothing I didn't learn while watching the film. The last piece is What's it Like Working with Peter? Just plain lame, we love him, he's the best director...I liked this movie very much. Aside from the physics teacher, all the characters were believable. The story was carefully built, and I cared about what happened to Andrew. The cover art may have you think this is a road picture, it is far from that. This is an intimate story of a boy that is forced to grow up too fast.",5,"Leave Andrew, Leave Andrew, Run and Hide",1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,3781,"['Leaving', 'Barstow', 'independent', 'film', 'will', 'either', 'inspire', 'quickly', 'leave', 'cold', 'Chances', 'are', 'will', 'sympathize', 'lead', 'character', 'Andrew.The', 'movie', 'told', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'Andrew', 'point', 'view', 'story', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'Andrew', 'grow', 'up', 'many', 'reasons', 'dealt', 'hand', 'pretty', 'bad', 'cards', 'forced', 'do', 'best', 'being', 'happy', 'One', 'meet', 'people', 'affect', 'life', 'physics', 'teacher', 'midnight', 'radio', 'DJ', 'best', 'friend', 'Carlos', 'mother', 'boyfriends', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'very', 'important', 'Jenny', 'have', 'strong', 'impact', 'Andrew', 'life', 'positive', 'negative.I', 'felt', 'strong', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', 'imprisonment', 'resignation', 'film', 'Andrew', 'single', 'mother', 'battling', 'own', 'demons', 'implied', 'almost', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Andrew', 'mother', 'adding', 'Andrew', 'sense', 'being', 'trapped', 'Barstow', 'California', 'became', 'pregnant', 'very', 'young', 'chose', 'keep', 'son', 'father', 'not', 'around', 'like', 'date', 'boys', 'close', 'son', 'age', 'Andrew', 'friend', 'Carlos', 'keep', 'close', 'other', 'school', 'are', 'not', 'part', 'popular', 'crowd', 'Carlos', 'great', 'friend', 'nothing', 'good', 'Andrew.This', 'was', 'not', 'expensive', 'production', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'spartan', 'sets', 'film', 'character', 'study', 'sparseness', 'appropriate', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Oddly', 'one', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'felt', 'was', 'acted', 'was', 'one', 'actor', 'long', 'television', 'resume', 'physics', 'played', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'mother', 'was', 'just', 'exactly', 'right', 'level', 'self', 'indulgence', 'Andrew', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Sheridan', 'mostly', 'television', 'career', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'American', 'Dreams', 'was', 'remarkable', 'played', 'introverted', 'quiet', 'intelligent', 'kind', 'high', 'school', 'boy.Pacing', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'right', 'director', 'knew', 'when', 'move', 'along', 'quickly', 'leave', 'out', '100', 'details', 'most', 'directors', 'would', 'include', 'when', 'include', 'subtle', 'detailed', 'moments', 'ending', 'wonderful', 'up', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Andrew', 'was', 'going', 'leave', 'not', 'wanted', 'shout', 'screen', 'get', 'Andrew', 'Camera', 'work', 'simple', 'competent', 'grittiness', 'film', 'physically', 'thematically', 'Dialog', 'well', 'recorded', 'clear.The', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'probably', 'somewhere', 'PG-13', 'R', 'rated', 'appropriate', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'Given', 'noises', 'mother', 'bedroom', 'discussions', '[', ']', 'erections', 'younger', 'viewers', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'nudity', 'violence', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'strong', 'language', 'themes', 'make', 'more', 'mature', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'sparse', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'series', 'interviews', 'first', 'director', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'decent', 'give', 'insight', 'why', 'took', 'project', 'second', 'Kevin', 'Sheridan', 'who', 'played', 'Andrew', 'was', 'script', 'writer', 'surprised', 'really', 'liked', 'fact', 'Kevin', 'wrote', 'movie', 'then', 'stars', 'last', 'interviews', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'interview', 'Michelle', 'Clunie', 'who', 'played', 'mother', 'just', 'so', 'bad', 'interview', 'actress', 'telling', 'character', 'not', 'revealing', 'nothing', 'did', ""n't"", 'learn', 'watching', 'film', 'last', 'piece', 'What', 'Working', 'Peter', 'Just', 'plain', 'lame', 'love', 'best', 'director', 'liked', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'Aside', 'physics', 'teacher', 'characters', 'were', 'believable', 'story', 'was', 'carefully', 'built', 'cared', 'what', 'happened', 'Andrew', 'cover', 'art', 'may', 'have', 'think', 'road', 'picture', 'far', 'intimate', 'story', 'boy', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'too', 'fast']",Leaving Barstow

Seems like in every shot, something's out of focus, sometimes the whole shot. Yeah, I get it...use depth-of-field to convey or soft-pedal (depending) the point of interest in the shot. I'm sure there's even a name for it in Hollywood. But for the whole movie? I also got pretty bored with the musical montages, particularly ironic considering the movie soundtrack isn't even available for sale (which seems like the usual reason directors stick a bunch of lengthy music-backed segments into the movie).So, be prepared for a bit of cliched technique in your movie. But other than that, it's a fine diversion for 90 minutes. Watching Andrew work his way out of his rut is satisfying.

1256864,AXXHEXU8VY8NP,B0029K3PME,Susan Barney,"[1, 1]","I was amazed to learn that this great character study was written by lead actor Kevin Sheridan.  It portrays the story of an 18 year old finishing up his senior year of high school, and his mother. Andrew (played by Kevin Sheridan) is a very bright 18 year old senior who threw away his application to a big name university (I think it was Harvard) out of a sense of loyalty to his mother, a waitress who has a hard time paying the rent or filling the fridge, but who spends a lot of time with her new boyfriend, who is only 4 years older than her son.  He plans instead to go to the city college.One of the overriding themes in the movie is that of people feeling &#34;trapped&#34; by having given up on their dreams and remaining in Barstow, a dusty, desert town miles from anywhere along the highway Vegas and LA.  He and his best friend Carlos had been planning together their escape through acceptance at a good college.Andrew is faced with resigning himself to staying and helping out his mother, and going to city college, or getting up the courage to follow his own dreams.",5,Great Character Study about finding the courage to follow your dreams,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,1081,"['was', 'amazed', 'learn', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'was', 'written', 'lead', 'actor', 'Kevin', 'Sheridan', 'story', '18', 'year', 'old', 'finishing', 'up', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'mother', 'Andrew', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Sheridan', 'very', 'bright', '18', 'year', 'old', 'senior', 'who', 'threw', 'away', 'application', 'big', 'name', 'university', 'think', 'was', 'Harvard', 'sense', 'loyalty', 'mother', 'waitress', 'who', 'hard', 'time', 'paying', 'rent', 'filling', 'fridge', 'who', 'lot', 'time', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'only', '4', 'years', 'older', 'son', 'instead', 'go', 'city', 'college.One', 'overriding', 'themes', 'movie', 'people', 'feeling', '34', 'trapped', '34', 'having', 'given', 'up', 'dreams', 'remaining', 'Barstow', 'dusty', 'desert', 'town', 'miles', 'anywhere', 'highway', 'Vegas', 'LA', 'best', 'friend', 'Carlos', 'had', 'been', 'planning', 'together', 'escape', 'acceptance', 'good', 'college.Andrew', 'faced', 'resigning', 'staying', 'helping', 'out', 'mother', 'going', 'city', 'college', 'getting', 'up', 'courage', 'follow', 'own', 'dreams']",Leaving Barstow
