And all sarcasm aside, this is a powerful and moving, while sad and disturbing portrait of a man absolutely at his wit's end. For that matter, he's also at his cognitive mind's end, his emotional bearing's end, his wife and brother's hearts' end, and the end of the social strata where insanity and pieces of souls reside.But Sean Penn is the man. This could have be Robert DeNiro thirty years ago; minor ticks, consciousness clouded with desperation, the powerful sense of wanting met with no ideas-all effortlessly expressed behind a nicely manicured moustache and classic big 70's hair. In fact there are a couple (at least, for I can name them) homages to Taxi Driver. His name is Sam Bicke, as opposed to Taxi's Travis Bickle, and in a bridge into the last scenes, Sam rehearses his act alone in his apartment with a gun tapped to the inside of his ankle. And the cowboy boots, and the pigeon-toe walk.There is also an obsessed, possessed resemblence to The King of Comedy here.This is a morose tale. It works as a portait of American desperation, one in which I can identify from the point of view of a poorer class angered by the corruption of wealth and power. The detachment necessary, apparently, to succeed and attain wealth and status. The dehumanization of others in the quest for the self.There is nothing extra on the DVD. A piece on the original inspiration would be a given. But no. Information on the tapes he sends to Leonard Bernstein, whether that was real, or it was someone else, and if they were discovered and used in the creation of the film. No. Nor is there anything on the filming, the resemblences to 9/11 or the approaches of the artists involved.But...another amazing and moving Sean Penn performance fulfills this experience.

This movie really has nothing to say about the Nixon. In fact ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" resembles Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" more than anything else. Here we also have a movie about a man who is fed up with society. Each man feels it is up to him to reform society. All they see around them is suffering. De Niro spoke of the ""scum"" that surrounded him in New York while Sam Bicke (Sean Penn) talks about a world where people just seem full of hate.The movie was directed by Niels Mueller and it is his debut film. And what a debut. How many young directors are able to have their work compared with Scorsese? To say that this film resembles ""Taxi Driver"" is not a putdown. I'm not suggesting the movie has a ""been there, done that"" feel. I'm not saying it is not original and should be overlooked. For me to compare the film to ""Taxi Driver"", my favorite Scorsese film, is a high compliment. I mean it as strong praise.The film also marks the return of Penn and Naomi Watts, the two co-starred in ""21 Grams"", another masterpiece. Watts is such a great actress with a wide range. First we see her in junk like ""The Ring Two"" and then I see her in this movie. How could it be the same person? She is such a force onscreen. My only regret is that there are not enough scenes with Watts. She and Penn have some good chemistry together. I wouldn't mind seeing them in another movie. And Sean Penn delivers an amazing performance. I really don't know what to sy about it. Before seeing this film I thought the best performance of the year belong to Liam Neeson in ""Kingsey"" having seen this I change my mind. Penn is able to show such restriction in this character. We can immediately sense who he is. We understand why he feels the way he does. We may not agree with his actions, but we understand him. How on Earth could Sean Penn do that? It is a shame he did not receive an Oscar nomination. But does the Academy ever do anything right? Not in my opinion.""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" is a movie many will be pleased with. It seems to be doing quite well in the video stores, it took me a while to find a copy. I hope this becomes one of those movies that becomes a big hit on video and gets discovered by a lot of people.Bottom-line Very impressive debut film from Niels Mueller. Has two remarkable performances by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn in a career highlight.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 0]","What becomes of a man who sinks into depression and paranoia before the invention of modern day psychotropic medications? If you're Samuel Bicke (Sean Penn), you go insane and see everyone as your enemy, especially the President of the United States (who happens to be ""Tricky Dick"" Nixon).The film starts with Samuel Bicke picking up a new job as a furniture salesman...and we soon learn that Sam has trouble with sales. He can't lie or bend the truth in any way (according to his way of thinking). So when asked about rock-bottom prices on items, he tells the truth (or at least what he believes to be the truth).Sam's paranoia about lying soon becomes an obsession. But he's also a contradiction himself. Later, as his psychosis worsens, he steals tires from his brother's tire business in order to start up his own mobile tire sales shop. But he doesn't (or can't) see that stealing and lying reside in the same ethical boat.Depression and madness come on full-force as his estranged wife (Naomi Watts) sends him divorce paper, a loan he was hoping for fails to materialize, and his brother (Michael Wincott) visits him and washes his hands of his very bizarre brother.A gun, a plane, the Whitehouse. Scary to think that this man thought of crashing an aircraft into the Whitehouse years before 9/11. And this was a man without all of his faculties intact!But, of course, Sam never makes it to the Whitehouse, as history tells us (Oh! Did I forget to mention that this is based on a true story?)*************************************************************************The acting by Sean Penn is superlative. A friend of mine keeps saying that he's ""the Marlon Brando of our era"". Quite possible. I have yet to see Sean Penn in a movie. And what I mean by that is that I see the characters he portrays, never the actor, and that was true of the Samuel Bicke character for sure.But one actor acting great does not an excellent film make. The film was farrrrr too depressing. Nothing of goodness was shown coming out of Sam's life (not even his children). I'm not saying that we should have all roses and tootsie rolls in films, but I also don't want to see something completely engulfed in depression.A good film for those who don't mind watching something quite dark.

887591,A38F6UBQJI9QG1,B0007R4SVI,"C. Copeland ""Film Fanatic""","[1, 1]","Genre: Political Thriller/DramaGenre Grade: BFinal Grade: B-While Sean Penn gave an excellent performance in this film, the extremely slow pace of the story was barely enough to keep me from turning it off. However, if you can get through the thick plot, there is a great story to be told. This movie is based on a true story about a man who decided to ""go all out"" back in 1974 during the Watergate scandal.Obviously his attempts are defeated in the end, as Nixon was never assassinated. However, the views brought forth by Sean Penn's character (one I'm sure he loved taking on) are disturbing to me. Not because I think they're wrong, but because I think they're right. While some of the ideas this man had might have been over-the-top, I could clearly see the reasoning for his motives. There were some very powerful lines in this film that I would love to hear a conservative try to argue their way out of without sounding like an insensitive prick. Not about this madman's views on assassinating a president he doesn't agree with, but on his views of America being controlled by power-hungry bastards. This point is strengthened in the analogy of the power structure of businesses and the lack of respect for employees.While this movie might be politically over-the-top or confusing for some viewers, I think it holds some strong statements that people should think about. Whether you agree with the ideas this film presents or not, I would hope you would at least see the message that sitting back quietly while the greedy liars take over our country is not the answer.It is my belief that being apolitical is dangerous and could be compared to burning the flag. While you have every right to not care what your government officials are doing behind closed doors, you should respect your country by taking a stand for what is right.Sorry for being so political.Quotables:Samuel Bicke: ""The meek shall not inherit the earth. The earth belongs to the bullies who do not care how they get to the top...as long as they arrive. I am an honest man. If that is to be my undoing then so be it.

To my surprise, the film was not a cheesy exploitative film, but a latter day attempt to reframe some of the very same issues that Martin Scorsese's Travis Bickle dealt with in his 1976 film Taxi Driver, which ironically inspired a real life assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. Thus, this 2004 film, directed by newby Niels Mueller, and written by Mueller and Kevin Kennedy, is the closing of a circle that began with the real like case of Sam Byck, a 44 year old man who in 1974 tried to hijack an airplane and fly it into the White House. The post-9/11 relevance of this act, and this film's capture of it, is manifest. Not to mention that this tale of Bycke, renamed for the film's purposes as Bicke (to make it more closely resemble Bickle, as rumor has it that Taxi Driver screenwriter Paul Schrader named his fictive character after hearing of the Byck hijack attempt.... That this subtle, well acted, and well written political film was lost, and appears on a bare bones DVD with no features, while Michael Moore's mockumentary Fahrenheit 9/11 got Oscar buzz, only shows how dimwitted the American public is. The only slight negatives are the anachronistic use of modern airport technology, such as security equipment and moving walkway, and the last scene, which shows a still alive Sam playing with a toy plane- the attempted symbolism is muddy and superfluous. Overall, though, this is an excellent film. Early on, Sam moans that a man does not stop being a man when he's at his job. Equally true is that neither does he stop being a man when he's frustrated. Knowing the former does not prevent the latter, but it does allow a terrific film to be made in the interstice between the two.",4,Underrated,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,2045,"['picked', 'up', 'cheap', 'used', 'version', 'Assassination', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'simply', 'spent', 'much', 'youth', 'listening', 'dad', 'yell', '37th', 'President', 'years', 'Watergate', 'scandal', 'figured', 'might', 'be', 'posthumous', 'vicarious', 'thrill', 'could', 'glean', 'watching', 'such', 'film', 'title', 'surprise', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'cheesy', 'exploitative', 'film', 'latter', 'day', 'attempt', 'reframe', 'very', 'same', 'issues', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'dealt', '1976', 'film', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'ironically', 'inspired', 'real', 'life', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'President', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'Thus', '2004', 'film', 'directed', 'newby', 'Niels', 'Mueller', 'written', 'Mueller', 'Kevin', 'Kennedy', 'closing', 'circle', 'began', 'real', 'case', 'Sam', 'Byck', '44', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'who', '1974', 'tried', 'hijack', 'airplane', 'fly', 'White', 'House', 'post-9/11', 'relevance', 'act', 'film', 'capture', 'manifest', 'Not', 'mention', 'tale', 'Bycke', 'renamed', 'film', 'purposes', 'Bicke', 'make', 'more', 'closely', 'resemble', 'Bickle', 'rumor', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'screenwriter', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'named', 'fictive', 'character', 'hearing', 'Byck', 'hijack', 'attempt', 'subtle', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'written', 'political', 'film', 'was', 'lost', 'bare', 'DVD', 'features', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'mockumentary', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'got', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'only', 'how', 'dimwitted', 'American', 'public', 'only', 'slight', 'negatives', 'are', 'anachronistic', 'use', 'modern', 'airport', 'technology', 'such', 'security', 'equipment', 'moving', 'walkway', 'last', 'scene', 'still', 'alive', 'Sam', 'playing', 'toy', 'plane-', 'attempted', 'symbolism', 'muddy', 'superfluous', 'Overall', 'though', 'excellent', 'film', 'Early', 'Sam', 'man', 'not', 'stop', 'being', 'man', 'when', 'job', 'Equally', 'true', 'neither', 'stop', 'being', 'man', 'when', 'frustrated', 'Knowing', 'former', 'not', 'prevent', 'latter', 'allow', 'terrific', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'interstice', 'two']",N/A

Unfortunately, a utopian self righteousness dooms his employment opportunities and marriage.  Bicke's wife is raising their two children and her patience is not limitless.  A friend who runs an auto repair shop (Don Cheadle) is also at his wit's end. We watch as Bicke's life is unraveling.  It is not a pleasant experience.  In many respects, he reminds one of a man getting behind a wheel of a car to deliberately crash it off the side of a mountain.Samuel Bicke is a narcissistically selfish individual.  He really doesn't give a damn about anybody but himself.  At the end, we truly realize the depths of his vileness.  No, Bicke is not a victim.  He is evil.  Other human beings are merely perceived to be props in Bicke's warped morality play.  Their suffering is deemed inconsequential.  Why does Bicke target Richard Nixon for assassination?  Heck, why did Lee Harvey Oswald pick John F. Kennedy?  In both instances, murdering a famous American president will guarantee getting your name in the history books.  Bicke wants to be a somebody.  The hell with those who get in the way of this goal.  Sean Penn may leave much to be desired as a political thinker.  Still, he one of America's finest actors.  Penn gives one of his finest performances in The Assassination of Richard Nixon.

887596,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0007R4SVI,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 3]","[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.]The movie is an intense focus on Sean Penn doing a sympathetic character study of a nut job named Samuel J. Bicke, a failed salesman who manages to lose at everything he does.  He is a salesman who believes you shouldn't lie to make a sale.  The only thing more ridiculous would be a lawyer who believes you shouldn't lie to win a case.  I had a friend once who was a bit of a nut job like Bicke who said he never lied.  To maintain this fiction he lied to himself.  It was the only way he could continue to think he never lied.  Such ideas (""a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds""--from Thoreau--is ironically similar) are the stuff of inflexible minds unable to adjust to the vagaries of humanity and to a world that is not rigidly set in black and white.  Bicke lived surrounded by a cloud of his own making, a cloud that kept him from seeing the world in a realistic way, so that instead he saw things through the shroud of his personal delusions.Sean Penn, in a virtuoso performance, makes us sympathize with Bicke's character. Bicke fails at his marriage and yet he has no idea why.  It seems that his wife Marie (Naomi Watts) has cut him off from her and from his children (and even the dog) because she wants to move on to somebody better; yet we know he is unstable and unable to understand how he has fails her.  And so she really does need to be rid of him.  He also fails as a salesman, and then he fails as an entrepreneur.  He is lost and desperate.  And all the while there is Richard Milhous Nixon on the tube lying to the American people, the same Richard Nixon that Bicke's boss holds up as a shining example of a great salesman, the kind of man that Bicke could never be.It is remarkable that Sean Penn was able to so convincingly portray such a character since he himself is nothing like the poor pathetic Bicke.  Penn has a winning personality, is charismatic and attractive.  Very few women would give up on him as Marie gives up on Bicke.  I mention this because if you know people you know that people like Penn and arguably Mel Gibson who played a somewhat similar role in Conspiracy Theory (1997), could never be one of the Bickes of the world since the world loves them too much.  It is only life's losers that become the crazies who do the things that Bicke does.  They feel so much like failures and have such low self-esteem that they are desperate to do anything to gain some kind of emotional equilibrium.  Penn worked hard on the role, and I thought he gave the kind of performance that would be the highlight of any actor's career.  But again, it was just so hard to not notice that this guy in the move named Bicke was in fact Sean Penn.The theme of the salesman as a tragic figure is an America staple.  I am thinking of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, and of David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross in which we see men who make a living by doing something they themselves respect only as an exploitive competition.  Here we have Jack Thompson (in a nice supporting role) as Jack Jones, furniture salesman, handing motivational books by Dale Carnegie and Norman Vincent Peale to Bicke in an effort to get Bicke up to speed on how to sell by selling himself.  I once knew a salesman who told me that the thing to remember is ""you are always selling love.  If you can do that, you will be a success.""I think director Niels Mueller did a good job of putting this story together.  It is an offbeat vehicle for Sean Penn, but the movie goes beyond his performance to examine the shallow, cold and corrupt values of our society that prevailed during the Nixon administration and have led some years down the road to the George W. Bush administration (only two days left as it write this!).  I hope that Mueller gets another chance to do something as interesting with a similarly excellent cast.",5,Remarkable performance by Sean Penn,1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,3993,"['[', 'Note', '500', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'book', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote', 'Get', 'Amazon', ']', 'movie', 'intense', 'focus', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'doing', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'study', 'nut', 'job', 'named', 'Samuel', 'J.', 'Bicke', 'failed', 'salesman', 'who', 'lose', 'everything', 'salesman', 'who', 'should', ""n't"", 'lie', 'make', 'sale', 'only', 'thing', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'would', 'be', 'lawyer', 'who', 'should', ""n't"", 'lie', 'win', 'case', 'had', 'friend', 'once', 'who', 'was', 'bit', 'nut', 'job', 'Bicke', 'who', 'said', 'never', 'lied', 'maintain', 'fiction', 'lied', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'continue', 'think', 'never', 'lied', 'Such', 'ideas', 'foolish', 'consistency', 'hobgoblin', 'little', 'minds', 'Thoreau', 'ironically', 'similar', 'are', 'stuff', 'inflexible', 'minds', 'unable', 'adjust', 'vagaries', 'humanity', 'world', 'not', 'rigidly', 'set', 'black', 'white', 'Bicke', 'lived', 'surrounded', 'cloud', 'own', 'making', 'cloud', 'kept', 'seeing', 'world', 'realistic', 'way', 'instead', 'saw', 'things', 'shroud', 'personal', 'delusions.Sean', 'Penn', 'virtuoso', 'performance', 'sympathize', 'Bicke', 'character', 'Bicke', 'marriage', 'yet', 'idea', 'why', 'wife', 'Marie', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'cut', 'off', 'children', 'even', 'dog', 'move', 'somebody', 'better', 'know', 'unstable', 'unable', 'understand', 'how', 'so', 'really', 'need', 'be', 'rid', 'also', 'salesman', 'then', 'entrepreneur', 'lost', 'desperate', 'while', 'Richard', 'Milhous', 'Nixon', 'tube', 'lying', 'American', 'people', 'same', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Bicke', 'boss', 'up', 'shining', 'example', 'great', 'salesman', 'kind', 'man', 'Bicke', 'could', 'never', 'be.It', 'remarkable', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'was', 'able', 'so', 'convincingly', 'portray', 'such', 'character', 'nothing', 'poor', 'pathetic', 'Bicke', 'Penn', 'winning', 'personality', 'charismatic', 'attractive', 'Very', 'few', 'women', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'Marie', 'up', 'Bicke', 'mention', 'know', 'people', 'know', 'people', 'Penn', 'arguably', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'who', 'played', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'role', 'Conspiracy', 'Theory', '1997', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'one', 'Bickes', 'world', 'world', 'too', 'much', 'only', 'life', 'losers', 'become', 'crazies', 'who', 'do', 'things', 'Bicke', 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'failures', 'have', 'such', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'are', 'desperate', 'do', 'anything', 'gain', 'kind', 'emotional', 'equilibrium', 'Penn', 'worked', 'hard', 'role', 'thought', 'gave', 'kind', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'highlight', 'actor', 'career', 'again', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'hard', 'not', 'notice', 'guy', 'move', 'named', 'Bicke', 'was', 'fact', 'Sean', 'Penn.The', 'theme', 'salesman', 'tragic', 'figure', 'America', 'staple', 'am', 'thinking', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'Death', 'Salesman', 'David', 'Mamet', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'see', 'men', 'who', 'make', 'living', 'doing', 'something', 'respect', 'only', 'exploitive', 'competition', 'Here', 'have', 'Jack', 'Thompson', 'nice', 'supporting', 'role', 'Jack', 'Jones', 'furniture', 'salesman', 'handing', 'motivational', 'books', 'Dale', 'Carnegie', 'Norman', 'Vincent', 'Peale', 'Bicke', 'effort', 'get', 'Bicke', 'up', 'speed', 'how', 'sell', 'selling', 'once', 'knew', 'salesman', 'who', 'told', 'thing', 'remember', 'are', 'always', 'selling', 'love', 'can', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'success', 'think', 'director', 'Niels', 'Mueller', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'putting', 'story', 'together', 'offbeat', 'vehicle', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'movie', 'performance', 'examine', 'shallow', 'cold', 'corrupt', 'values', 'society', 'prevailed', 'Nixon', 'administration', 'have', 'led', 'years', 'down', 'road', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'administration', 'only', 'two', 'days', 'left', 'hope', 'Mueller', 'chance', 'do', 'something', 'interesting', 'similarly', 'excellent', 'cast']",N/A

887598,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0007R4SVI,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","Sean Penn's scarifying, coiled-spring performance is the predominant force in first-time filmmaker Niels Mueller's fictionalized story of would-be assassin Samuel Byck, who became obsessed with killing then-President Nixon in 1974. Those who have seen Stephen Sondheim's musicalAssassinswill recognize Byck as one of its infamous characters. His name has been changed to ""Bicke"" in the chilling 2004 film version, but the basic skeleton of the true story remains. After losing his sales job, his wife and a government loan to start his own business, he became so paranoid that he decided to hijack an airliner and have it crash into the White House. The parallels to 9/11, especially the events recreated in Paul Greengrass' viscerally powerfulUnited 93, are obvious, but the bulk of this relentlessly downbeat film is about Bicke's descent into madness, one that Penn evokes with supple dexterity. In a performance that immediately recalls Robert DeNiro's (perhaps) coincidentally named Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese's 1976 classic,Taxi Driver, Penn proves again to be among the most effectively risk-taking of actors.The screenplay itself, co-written by Mueller and Kevin Kennedy, reflects a more predictable storyline, most of which is a flashback. Showing apparent signs of a bipolar disorder, Bicke struggles with a life full of compromises and deludes himself into thinking he is an honorable man. His grand ideas of a thriving business and a loving marriage are at odds with reality, but instead of facing up to the challenges, he slides quickly from meekly pathetic to utterly pathological.  He even thinks composer Leonard Bernstein is somehow his muse and writes him of his grand plans. The film's last ten minutes are eye-flinchingly realistic, but they provide the necessary denouement to a tragically misguided footnote in U.S. history. Beyond Penn, there is a trio of strong players used minimally in the film - Don Cheadle as Bickle's only friend and would-be partner Bonny and submerging their Aussie accents convincingly, a brunette Naomi Watts as Bickle's estranged waitress wife Marie and Jack Thompson appropriately greasy as his deceptively avuncular boss. The 2005 DVD provides a solid set of extras - an extremely informative commentary track from Mueller, a brief behind-the-scenes short, and several deleted scenes.",4,Penn's Extraordinary Work Carries a Bleak Portrait of a Real-Life Psychopath's Mental Descent,1205452800,"03 14, 2008",2008,2343,"['Sean', 'Penn', 'scarifying', 'coiled-spring', 'performance', 'predominant', 'force', 'first-time', 'filmmaker', 'Niels', 'Mueller', 'fictionalized', 'story', 'would-be', 'assassin', 'Samuel', 'Byck', 'who', 'became', 'obsessed', 'killing', 'then-President', 'Nixon', '1974', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'musicalAssassinswill', 'recognize', 'Byck', 'one', 'infamous', 'characters', 'name', 'been', 'changed', 'Bicke', 'chilling', '2004', 'film', 'version', 'basic', 'skeleton', 'true', 'story', 'remains', 'losing', 'sales', 'job', 'wife', 'government', 'loan', 'start', 'own', 'business', 'became', 'so', 'paranoid', 'decided', 'hijack', 'airliner', 'have', 'White', 'House', 'parallels', '9/11', 'especially', 'events', 'recreated', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'viscerally', 'powerfulUnited', '93', 'are', 'obvious', 'bulk', 'relentlessly', 'downbeat', 'film', 'Bicke', 'descent', 'madness', 'one', 'Penn', 'supple', 'dexterity', 'performance', 'immediately', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'perhaps', 'coincidentally', 'named', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', '1976', 'classic', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Penn', 'again', 'be', 'most', 'effectively', 'risk-taking', 'actors.The', 'screenplay', 'co-written', 'Mueller', 'Kevin', 'Kennedy', 'more', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'most', 'flashback', 'Showing', 'apparent', 'signs', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'Bicke', 'life', 'full', 'compromises', 'thinking', 'honorable', 'man', 'grand', 'ideas', 'thriving', 'business', 'loving', 'marriage', 'are', 'odds', 'reality', 'instead', 'facing', 'up', 'challenges', 'quickly', 'meekly', 'pathetic', 'utterly', 'pathological', 'even', 'composer', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'somehow', 'muse', 'grand', 'plans', 'film', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'are', 'eye-flinchingly', 'realistic', 'provide', 'necessary', 'denouement', 'tragically', 'misguided', 'footnote', 'U.S.', 'history', 'Beyond', 'Penn', 'trio', 'strong', 'players', 'used', 'minimally', 'film', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Bickle', 'only', 'friend', 'would-be', 'partner', 'Bonny', 'submerging', 'Aussie', 'accents', 'convincingly', 'brunette', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Bickle', 'estranged', 'waitress', 'wife', 'Marie', 'Jack', 'Thompson', 'appropriately', 'greasy', 'deceptively', 'avuncular', 'boss', '2005', 'DVD', 'solid', 'set', 'extras', 'extremely', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'Mueller', 'brief', 'behind-the-scenes', 'short', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A

It's pretty much a given by now that if Sean Penn is a movie, said movie is going to be amazing. I offer as evidence three consecutive Penn pictures: Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, Alejandro I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's 21 Grams and Niels Mueller's little-seen by others than critics The Assassination of Richard Nixon. We could also go as far back as 2001 for I Am Sam, but I won't count that one because portraying a mentally handicapped person pretty much guarantees an actor an Oscar nomination and critical acclaim. Instead, I'd mention his performance in Woody Allen's 1999 film Sweet and Lowdown for which he also earned an Oscar nomination. Penn has become arguably the greatest actor of the decade. I'd go so far as to call him this generation's Robert De Niro, something that we are in need of being that De Niro himself has disgraced his legacy by turning into a would-be comic actor in dreary, blatantly commercial product like Meet the Parents (and its sequel) and Analyze This (and its sequel).Being the closest thing this decade has to a De Niro, it's not too surprising that Penn would tackle a De Niro-like role in The Assassination of Richard Nixon. Based on the true story of a frustrated salesman turned would-be assassin, the film has obvious  echoes of Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader's 1976 classic about cabbie turned killer Travis Bickle. Sean Penn plays Sam Bicke (even the names are similar) a disgruntled working man who comes to the conclusion that Tricky Dick is to blame for society's problems and opts to amend things by doing away with the man. Penn is flawless as the headstrong yet slightly deranged Bicke as we see his progression from husband and father to disturbed, enraged killer. From quiet anger to rage to sadness to dementia, Penn knocks it out of the park in a performance that must (and does) carry the film.The film is not stylish or extravagant and we are shown no more than what we need to see by director Niels Mueller. It has political leanings, but does not have to be seen as a political film. It works just fine as the story of a man pushed over the edge by what he sees as injustice. It's a fascinating, compelling film from beginning to end; a touching, sad, disturbing portrait of a man who had quite simply had enough.",4,Penn does De Niro and winds up in a Bickle,1114214400,"04 23, 2005",2005,2372,"['phrase', 'outstanding', 'Oscar-worthy', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'performance', 'become', 'redundant', 'recent', 'years', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'now', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'movie', 'said', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'amazing', 'offer', 'evidence', 'three', 'consecutive', 'Penn', 'pictures', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Alejandro', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', '21', 'Grams', 'Niels', 'Mueller', 'little-seen', 'others', 'critics', 'Assassination', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'could', 'also', 'go', 'far', 'back', '2001', 'Am', 'Sam', 'wo', ""n't"", 'count', 'one', 'portraying', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'person', 'pretty', 'much', 'guarantees', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'Instead', ""'d"", 'mention', 'performance', 'Woody', 'Allen', '1999', 'film', 'Sweet', 'Lowdown', 'also', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Penn', 'become', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'actor', 'decade', ""'d"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'call', 'generation', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'something', 'are', 'need', 'being', 'De', 'Niro', 'disgraced', 'legacy', 'turning', 'would-be', 'comic', 'actor', 'dreary', 'blatantly', 'commercial', 'product', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'sequel', 'Analyze', 'sequel', '.Being', 'closest', 'thing', 'decade', 'De', 'Niro', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'Penn', 'would', 'tackle', 'De', 'Niro-like', 'role', 'Assassination', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'frustrated', 'salesman', 'turned', 'would-be', 'assassin', 'film', 'obvious', 'echoes', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Paul', 'Schrader', '1976', 'classic', 'cabbie', 'turned', 'killer', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Sam', 'Bicke', 'even', 'names', 'are', 'similar', 'disgruntled', 'working', 'man', 'who', 'conclusion', 'Tricky', 'Dick', 'blame', 'society', 'problems', 'opts', 'amend', 'things', 'doing', 'away', 'man', 'Penn', 'flawless', 'headstrong', 'yet', 'slightly', 'deranged', 'Bicke', 'see', 'progression', 'husband', 'father', 'disturbed', 'enraged', 'killer', 'quiet', 'anger', 'rage', 'sadness', 'dementia', 'Penn', 'park', 'performance', 'must', 'carry', 'film.The', 'film', 'not', 'stylish', 'extravagant', 'are', 'shown', 'no', 'more', 'what', 'need', 'see', 'director', 'Niels', 'Mueller', 'political', 'leanings', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'seen', 'political', 'film', 'just', 'fine', 'story', 'man', 'pushed', 'edge', 'what', 'injustice', 'fascinating', 'compelling', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'touching', 'sad', 'disturbing', 'portrait', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'quite', 'simply', 'had', 'enough']",N/A

887601,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B0007R4SVI,General Zombie,"[2, 2]","'The Assassination of Richard Nixon' is fairly painful to watch, which I suppose is the point.  It's about Sam Bicke, a paranoid, delusional man whose marriage has fallen apart and who simply can't make it in the modern world all culminating in his eventual attempt to assassinate Nixon via an airplane hijacking.  Naturally, this is going remind you of some other films, such as 'Falling Down', 'Fight Club', 'Bruiser' and, most notably, 'Taxi Driver'.  This is definitely the most naturalistic of the films, presenting his descent in a fairly straight forward, believable manner.  It's different from those films, however, in that we stand outside the protagonist. (Or I did, anyway.)  Certainly, we can sympathize with his plight to some degree, but his motives don't all add up.  The violent outbursts in those films seem, if not really justified, at least inevitable.  Here we simply see a man whose life falls apart which causes him to start spouting Marxist slogans, which generally don't have a whole lot to do with his plight, and eventually stage and assassination attempt.  The connection between the two isn't completely drawn, which is probably realistic even as it makes it more difficult to relate to him.  And I think this inability to fully empathize with his position makes it a weaker film than any of those I mentioned other than 'Bruiser'.  But, it's interesting to see a new perspective, and this film is probably the most truthful of any of them.Sean Penn plays Bicke.  Frankly, I've always found him to be an overrated actor.  Most of the time he just frowns and mutters, which is pretty much how he acts in real life, from what I've seen.  I've seen him do some more impressive stuff lately, however, such as in '21 Grams', and he's very good here.  Bicke is interesting in that he is a very principled man, far more so than the average modern man, as far as I can tell.  He is incredibly uncomfortable with deception of any kind, yet he is also a sales man.  Not a good combination.  More significantly his marriage is falling apart,  though he doesn't seem prepared to admit it.  The scenes between him and his wife Marie (played by Naomi Watts with an ugly brunette dye-job, or wig, perhaps) are remarkably embarrassing; She clearly has absolutely no interest in seeing him or listening to anything he has to say, but she pities him enough that she can't quite tell him to go to hell.  And he is, of course, completely oblivious to all of this.  These problems fuel one another, as Bicke imagines that he can win his wife back should he succeed in business, but he is so ill-equipped to deal with the business world that he just further degrades and humiliates himself while fueling his hopeless desire for reconciliation.  And that's what this  film comes down to-- We simply watch Bicke embarrass himself again and again:  His bosses are condescending and inhuman; He is hopelessly graceless on the sales floor, particularly when he tries to flirt with a female customer;  He comes up with a ridiculous idea for a mobile tire store which leads to some acts of thievery on his part, all while he is spewing poorly conceived anti-capitalist invectives pretty much whenever he gets frustrated.  The film is particularly interested in that it provides the contrary positions.  Bicke airs his various grievances to Marie and his best friend Bonny, but they won't hear much of it.  `That's life' they say, pretty much.  They have all the same problems he has, but they're getting by.I should note that this film is actually quite extraordinarily funny at moments, but it's a sad, embarrassed kind of humor.  Needless to say, we are laughing at Bicke at these moments.  The scene where he goes to a Black Panther headquarters has one really riotously funny line, which I will not spoil.Eventually, Bicke loses all rationality and decides to kill Nixon, who he sees as a representation of all the hollowness of the modern world.  True to form, the film ends more in farce than tragedy, as his plan is hopelessly ill-conceived. (Well, it's got some tragedy to, but it's mostly just another grand failure on Bicke's part)  It does have a certain intensity, however, and Penn is very good in these scenes, barely concealing his panic underneath exaggerated rage.To be blunt, the film is a little slow and drawn out despite it's fairly short length.  It gets a bit repetitious, frankly.  Also, it's a little sad that we never get to learn who Bicke was before and just what it is that went wrong.  The film opens a year before the assassination attempt, but things have already gone to hell by this point.  The dissolution of his marriage seems to be at the root of his eventual madness, but we don't know quite why this happens.  I dunno if he'd have been alright, precisely, had his family staid together, but he wouldn't have gone of the edge.  We kind of assume that Bicke wasn't always such a sniveling loser, cause if he were he wouldn't have gotten married in the first place, but we don't quite know what went wrong or why or how he changed.  We know he has problems with keeping jobs, but that really doesn't seem to be the major cause of the divorce.  The point may well be that there is no reason.  I dunno.  But I was definitely curious about it.Anyway, that's it.  This is a sad movie.  Normally I'd call a movie depressing, but that isn't quite the case here.  Again, you feel sorry for Bicke, but you can't totally get inside him, so it's not as personally affecting as it might have been.  In the end, it's almost a little reaffirming.  In the end I thought, `I may be a loser, but I'm no Sam Bicke.'Grade: B+",4,"Man, what a loser",1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,5643,"['Assassination', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'fairly', 'painful', 'watch',

887602,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007R4SVI,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","THE ASSASSINATION OF RICHARD NIXON is clearly one of the most profoundly disturbing films of the past few years.  It is a shocker that is all the more powerful for the low-key presentation that acts as a prelude to a pitiful tragedy.  The added fact that this story, so creatively written for the screen by Director Niels Mueller and screenwriter Kevin Kennedy, is based on true story makes it all the more harrowing.Few of us knew about the tale of Sam Byck who on February 27, 1974 attempted to hijack a passenger plane out of Baltimore in order to destroy President Nixon, the figurehead of all Byck's failure and frustration with life in an America gone sour for the Little Man.  Even in his vengeful attempt to gain justice for his life gone awry and become a 'somebody' the world would notice he failed and committed suicide aboard his unsuccessfully hijacked plane.Mueller and Kennedy have, by admission in the credits, altered the names and locations and events of the real story in order to emphasize the anatomy of a mind in the process of disintegration.  Same Bicke (Sean Penn) is a well-meaning, borderline adapted, perpetual loser, a man who as the film begins is taping a farewell tape to Leonard Bernstein, one of the few men he admires.  Appropriately throughout the film the background music is Beethoven's 'Emperor Concerto' (many double meanings) and a Piano Sonata, the music lending a sense of surrealistic sanity to the events unfolding.  Bicke is separated from his wife Marie (Naomi Watts) and children and yearns to be reunited, much against the will of Marie.  He is employed by a furniture sales store and his boss Jack (Jack Thompson) preaches Dale Carnegie and The Power of Positive Thinking to encourage Sam to sell, sell, sell with little attention to clients' needs except lying to get their money.Sam plans/dreams of owning his own traveling Tire Store with his best friend mechanic Bonny (Don Cheadle): Sam has left the employ of his brother Julius (Michael Wincott) who still runs the family's tire business in a less than scrupulous manner.  Sam applies to the Small Business Association for a loan and encounters bureaucratic red tape to further thwart his goals. In his broken state of receiving a Divorce Decree from Marie, being refused his loan, losing/quitting his job, observing the (exaggerated) racism against Bonny and the sexism against Marie, he begins to focus on the omnipresent television broadcasts of Richard Nixon making the dastardly comments about money and war and the Watergate mess.  With his life in shreds he manufactures the plan for destroying Nixon in an act that, as he has explained to Leonard Bernstein on tape, will finally make the world pay attention to the honest worker little men: he will be remembered for this final act.  The remainder of the film is a hushed denouement that unveils Sam's preparations, rehearsals, and ultimate failed scheme.Sean Penn is extraordinary as Sam Bicke, creating a downtrodden man whose grip on life is far too tenuous to even approach success in any endeavor and yet shows us the idealism and naivet&eacute; of this Everyman that makes us yearn for some degree of reward for him.  It is by far the most underplayed role in Penn's shining repertoire and certainly one of his finest creations.  The entire cast is excellent: Jack Thompson is oily and hateful as he wears his Cheshire Cat grin, Naomi Watts as usual makes an unforgettable, credible character with very little screen time, and Don Cheadle and Michael Wincott provide some of the more soft and memorable lines to offset Penn's thought processes.  The direction of Niels Mueller is astonishingly well paced and his subtle choices of claustrophobic spaces for portraying the inner mind of Bicke and his use of Beethoven's music to delicately underscore the initial concept of a tape to conductor Leonard Bernstein are choices that come from a profoundly dedicated cinematic artist.  Highly Recommended.

887603,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,B0007R4SVI,Guy De Federicis,"[0, 1]","Just when you think there's little reason to continue watching this pathetic true life loser descending further into delusion, ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" starts running madly and doesn't stop until it's shattering conclusion, sure to mobilize your mind to a more heightened sense of awareness. Before the final twenty minutes or so, it's discomforting to share time with Sam Bicke (Sean Penn), an office furniture salesman who longs for success but seems to be sold up the river by the world at large. His wife (Naomi Watts) is divorcing him, his boss is threatening his job, his successful businessman brother is 'washing his hands' of him, and the bank has denied his loan application, in which all his future hopes and plans lie. Watching him is like running over a wild animal with your car, a feeling of disgust and helplessness, and a reassurance that you didn't swerve and hit a tree, or that your life isn't nearly as awful as his. In his warped perspective, there's nothing else to do but hijack a jet and hopefully slam it into The White House with the intention of killing the President. ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" is based on a true event that occurred in 1974 and is a chilling reminder of what we always understood to be a magnificant vulnerability in our national defense.

In 1973-1974 a recently reelected president comes under fire for his Vietnamese policy that does not come to the end of the war in Vietnam, for his repressive policy, particularly against the Black Panther Party, for te Watergate scandal, and for his economic policy that is not producing the development that is expected. This is the story of a small salesman in an office furniture store who seems to be unable to cope with his job, with his business project, with the racist problem and with society at large. Little by little from neurotic he becomes psychotic and he has to impress his mark onto society, even against the will or the indifference of this society. In the hullabaloo around Nixon's scandals, Watergate and others, he decides to target that president. His assassination will never get close to approaching Nixon himself, which explains that no one knows about it, but it ends very badly. The film has a title that is supposed to lure people into being interested in it, though at the time it might have been felt as some kind of militant act against the crook of a president they had.

887607,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0007R4SVI,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[29, 31]","Sean Penn gives a brilliant, compelling performance as Samuel Bicke, a desperate man whose world is falling apart around him. As his everyday life spirals out of control, we observe him lose his already slippery grasp on reality. ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" is loosely based on the true story of a Baltimore man who tried to hijack a commercial airplane and fly it into the White House in 1974.This chilling story unfolds grimly, like a terribly skewed canticle for the prototypical little man, squashed by the system. Writer, and first-time director Niels Mueller succeeds in helping us to understand, and even sympathize with Sam and his troubled life, without manipulating us into condoning his actions. It is 1973 and Sam Bicke's life is already beginning to crumble. His demise plays out against the politically volatile backdrop of the Nixon presidency. Sam and his wife Marie, (Naomi Watts) have been separated for over a year. He obviously loves her and adores their children. She is a hard working cocktail waitress, and it is apparent that one of the reasons their marriage has failed is Bicke's inability to hold down a steady job. When it becomes obvious that she has no interest in getting back together with him, Sam begins to stalk her - although he doesn't see it that way. There is a heartbreaking scene where he pays his family a ""surprise visit,"" and is asked to leave and call before he comes over again. The children go in for dinner, the door closes and Bicke looks longingly at what was once his home. He goes into the yard, hugs his dog, and lovingly puts his hands on a tree in the yard. His anguish and loneliness are palpable.Sam lost his job with his brother's tire company because he believes customers are being cheated by not being told the actual amount of profit the business makes on each tire purchased. He feels a more ethical approach would be to just tell customers the true percentage of profit and offer to split the difference - cut profits in half - rather than lie about giving non-existent special deals and offers. When his best friend tries to explain to him patiently, ""It's not lying, it's business,"" Sam doesn't buy it. He is a man of integrity, a regular guy who works hard and wants a share of the American Dream. However, he lacks the brains and competency to become a successful businessman. Now, newly employed as an office furniture salesman, he discovers that his new boss, (a controlling, gruff Jack Thompson), wants him to lie to customers also. Nervous at work, aware that as a new employee he is being observed, he literally cringes before customers, while his boss subjects him to constant criticism.The one bright spot in Bicke's life is his dream of opening an automobile tire company, operated out of an old school bus, with his auto mechanic friend, Bonny Simmons, a black auto mechanic, (superbly played by Don Cheadle). Sam applies for a bank loan with the Small Business Administration, but cannot get the government to review his application in less than the standard eight-to-ten weeks. Nervous, fearing his application will be denied, he begins to stalk the local loan administrator, obnoxiously pushing to have his paperwork processed faster.Closely identifying with minorities, African Americans and Native Americans, because he feels persecuted and invisible, Bicke pays a visit to the Baltimore chapter of the Black Panthers to donate money. He suggests that they might double their membership if they allowed whites to join their organization and changed their name to The Zebras. It is comical, yes.....and, given Bicke's sincerity, it is heartbreaking also.Sam receives notification, by mail, that the divorce proceedings Marie had instigated, seemingly unbeknownst to him, have been finalized. He had deluded himself into believing they were still working on their relationship. When he tries to contact her at home, she and the children are gone. His loan application is rejected. He quits his job. He totally loses it and explodes in violent, deluded rage.He sees dishonesty, hypocrisy, everywhere, especially in the White House. Sam's boss told him, with admiration, that President Nixon is the world's greatest salesman, because he swindled the American people into voting for him - twice. In 1968 Nixon promised to end the Vietnam War. He did not. He ran on the same premise in 1972, and won again. The president also promised aid for the small businessman, and never delivered - at least not to Sam. Richard Nixon becomes the physical embodiment of all his disappointments, failures, a world gone wrong. When Sam sees news footage of a soldier that stole an Army helicopter and landed it on the front lawn of the White House, he realizes it would not have been difficult to crash it into the President's residence.A self-described grain of sand on the beach of America, Sam chooses composer and orchestra leader, Leonard Bernstein, a man he idolizes, to tell his story. He makes and mails the musician tapes which begin: ""Mr Bernstein: I have the utmost respect for you. Your music is both pure and honest and that is why I have chosen you to present the truth about me to the world."" The film's score contains piano and violin sonatas by Beethoven, and the music provides a particularly moving backdrop, especially during these sequences.This extremely well crafted movie offers insight into the mind of a man who doesn't possess the necessary skills to make it in the world, and who blames society for his own inadequacies. The televised news images of this turbulent period in American history, projected into his living room on a daily basis, further feed his delusions. Bicke's descent into madness is painful to watch.

Not good enough to measure up to his older brother in business, not good enough to qualify for a loan to start a business, and most importantly, not good enough to hang onto the love of his life, his wife (Naomi Watts). Bicke is a fish out of water in the world of sales. But he is unable to find his niche in the workplace, in society, or in the culture. Ultimately, this lostness, this disaffectedness, is expressed in his inability to find any meaning in life.But there might be one way to achieve success, even notoriety. Bicke becomes fixated on President Nixon. Nixon becomes an allegorical figure representing society as a whole, and the subject of Bicke's pent up rage, his isolation, and his inadequacy.The assassination of Richard Nixon is about an individual who loses hope in himself, his family, his faith, and in life. When there is nothing left to live for, there is nothing left to live for. Out of this sullen, self-inflicted torture emerges an explosion of rage and angst.Sean Penn and Naomi Watts carry this movie along to its desperate, hopeless conclusion with grace, talent, and adeptness.",3,Hopeless.

887609,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B0007R4SVI,J from NY,"[4, 4]","""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" is one of the more impacting films I've seen in recent years, but if you're not an admirer of psychological drama it's best to stay far, far away.The tragic tale of Samuel Byck is deeply entwined with the anguish and outrage of the late 1960's and the still tense era of the early 1970's.  An unemployed tire salesman who suffered from deep depression and could not succeed in any area of his life, he turned his sights on the powers that be, who were as hateable then as they are now: Tricky Dick was bombing anything on the map and Robert McNamara was lying as easily as he breathed. While Byck's problems were mostly personal, his documented conspiratorial ""fantasies"" about the government oppressing the poor don't seem too insane to me.Penn gives a stunning performance as Byck sinks lower and lower into loneliness, disillusionment, and finally full blown madness.  His inappropriate social affect, self consciousness, and the desolate conditions of his life (Naomi Watts plays perhaps the ultimate villain:  Byck's icy girlfriend) all spill over into an assassination attempt and violent rampage.There are moments in this film which are touching, albeit in an extremely sad way.  At one point, Penn's Byck is determined to kill his boss for firing him--when he arrives at the restaurant sweating like a pig with a pistol concealed, his boss consoles him momentarily: ""It was nothing personal.  Here, take this, wipe yourself off.  You okay?""Though ultimately a murderer, Penn's compassionate performance sheds light on some of Byck's better qualities.  At one point he is so determined to do something about the racial divide between whites and blacks that he bursts into a Black Panthers' meeting room, and encourages the leader to start a new group called: ""Zebras"".  His treatment of his frequently abused black co-worker is a good example of what he might have been had he not chosen such a rageful response to a dismal state of affairs.The movie is pretty bleak and the ending is even worse.  Sean Penn just gets better and better as an actor, and he skillfully reflects all sides of this tragic and malevolent character.

It's inspired by a true story, although I'm not sure how true it is, the title is decieving and the films motive isn't entirely clear. How are we supposed to feel about the main character Sam Bicke (rhymes with Rick and whose name was actually spelled Byck)? Are we supposed to feel sympathy? Are we supposed to be horrified? Well, even with the events at the end of the movie, you can't help but feel a little sympathetic towards Bicke. Sean Penn makes Bicke into a really sad character and this is one of his best performances since ""Mystic River.""Sam Bicke is a socially-challenged office furniture salesmen who's separated from his wife (a black-haired Naomi Watts) and isn't entirely sure how to handle it. His only friend is Bonnie (Don Cheadle), a black mechanic who seems to be the only one who notices that Sam isn't entirely sane. While Bicke narrates his story, we see Bicke slowly starting to hate Richard Nixon, while this is apparent, we are never told flat out that he has plans to assassinate Nixon. It seems Bicke is going to hijack a plane and fly it into the white house, but it is only hinted at. The hijacking scene is the most powerful in the film, especially the end where Penn runs around with a toy airplane. I would give this movie five stars if not for the mistakes that were made. We never, for example, see the after effects of the hijacking are. Like, Bicke's wife or friends or something. B+",4,A Powerful Film.

Also the co-scriptwriter, Muller must have had Penn in mind from the inception to recreate the deteriorating life of real-life Samuel Bycke, who in 1974 tried to hijack an airplane for the sole purpose of crashing into the White House and killing Richard Nixon.Why? Therein lies the story. Bicke is one of those pathetic individuals who cannot succeed because of a personality disorder. That pathos eventually morphs into desperation. Lives of quiet desperation can easily turn into very noisy, very violent lives. This turn is equivalent to the relational stalker who kills his beloved rather than let someone else have her. A desperate man must do desperate things. At one point he feels so powerless, he attempts to join the Black Panthers.Why Richard Nixon? Bick abhors dishonesty of any kind. When his boss, a furniture store owner, tells him Richard Nixon is the best salesman in the world, Bick records that information on his heart and mind. Nixon lied to get elected and reelected.Forget Sean Penn's politics. When the man is on-screen, only his acting should be held accountable. In this role he plays the distorted, unstable personality who gradually descends into total alienation, inch by foot until he reaches the point of no return.

It's true that he's mentally disturbed, but not so much as the society he lives in (a ""cancerous society"" as he himself puts it). The period 1973-74 was a difficult time in the history of the USA, a time when americans had to face corruption in the high places, a time of madness and astonishment, with a reality difficult to accept. The violent act that Sam Bicke performs at the end of the movie corresponds to the natural response of a ""little man"" who feels cast out from society and his family. He tries to give some sense to this world but his efforts find no destiny. Obviously enough, this does not justify his acts, but we understand them if we consider his own personal perception of the reality surrounding him. The movie captures Sam's inner world in the details, in the subleties of his behavior, in the confusing relation with his wife, and the condescending relation with his boss. These minor circumstances are wonderfully portrayed in a most impressive acting by Sean Penn. The movie reminded me of Joe Schumacher's ""Falling Down"" (1983), Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"", and the excellent peruvian movie ""Dias de Santiago"", which, coincidentally enough, I had seen just the day before I saw this one. There you also have a loser, mentally stressed, who tries (to no avail) to give some sense to his personal universe and the one of his family.

The foundation of the film spins off a true event that closely follows the main character, Samuel Bicke (Sean Penn), and the development of his anxiety and depression.  The progress of his psychological disorder provides a complex view of Bicke's life, which intricately displays his unbending morals, values, and beliefs.  Consequently, these fundamental pieces of Bicke's persona affect his professional and personal life while providing new information that he cognitively adapts to his way of life.  This turns into a self-destructive pattern where his rigid manners begin to affect everything around him, as Bicke decides that he should assassinate President Richard Nixon.Film begins with two sequential flashbacks that bring the audience back a year in order to understand what led to Bicke's behavior and actions.  However, before the first flashback the film provides a hint of what is to come before the film jumps back two weeks.  This middle section of the film discloses further hints of what to expect, as the final flashback works its way back to where the film once started.  The organization of the film process offers an opportunity to ponder why while building an understanding of how things affected Bicke.  In addition, the method in which the film presents information also conveys a sense of sympathy for Bicke, as he endures severe problematic situations while his rigid persona exaggerates minute incidents.  Ultimately, it turns all of his life into a churning bedlam that leads him into a cerebral maze where the viewer finds him completely lost.Sean Penn's brilliant performance is the catalyst that elevates the story into this truly disturbing image of how a psychological disorder develops.  By the way, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences robbed Penn of the Oscar for Best Performance of an Actor in a Male Leading Role, which was by far the best performance of 2004.  The supporting cast consisting of Don Cheadle, Naomi Watts, and Jack Thompson among others enhanced Penn's performance, as they bring out the contrasts of what makes Bicke different to the rest of the society.  Altogether, the Assassination of Richard Nixon is a magnificent film about the dark and disturbing world, which small part of humanity experience while living on the fringe of society.",5,The Anatomy of Psychological Disorder...,1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,2437,"['anatomy', 'psychological', 'disorder', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'title', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'depressing', 'theme', 'foundation', 'film', 'off', 'true', 'event', 'closely', 'main', 'character', 'Samuel', 'Bicke', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'development', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'progress', 'psychological', 'disorder', 'complex', 'view', 'Bicke', 'life', 'intricately', 'unbending', 'morals', 'values', 'beliefs', 'Consequently', 'fundamental', 'pieces', 'Bicke', 'persona', 'affect', 'professional', 'personal', 'life', 'providing', 'new', 'information', 'cognitively', 'way', 'life', 'self-destructive', 'pattern', 'where', 'rigid', 'manners', 'begin', 'affect', 'everything', 'Bicke', 'should', 'assassinate', 'President', 'Richard', 'Nixon.Film', 'two', 'sequential', 'flashbacks', 'bring', 'audience', 'back', 'year', 'order', 'understand', 'what', 'led', 'Bicke', 'behavior', 'actions', 'However', 'first', 'flashback', 'film', 'hint', 'what', 'come', 'film', 'back', 'two', 'weeks', 'middle', 'section', 'film', 'further', 'hints', 'what', 'expect', 'final', 'flashback', 'way', 'back', 'where', 'film', 'once', 'started', 'organization', 'film', 'process', 'opportunity', 'ponder', 'why', 'building', 'understanding', 'how', 'things', 'affected', 'Bicke', 'addition', 'method', 'film', 'presents', 'information', 'also', 'sense', 'sympathy', 'Bicke', 'severe', 'problematic', 'situations', 'rigid', 'persona', 'minute', 'incidents', 'Ultimately', 'life', 'churning', 'bedlam', 'cerebral', 'maze', 'where', 'viewer', 'completely', 'lost.Sean', 'Penn', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'catalyst', 'story', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'image', 'how', 'psychological', 'disorder', 'develops', 'way', 'Academy', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Arts', 'Sciences', 'robbed', 'Penn', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Performance', 'Actor', 'Male', 'Leading', 'Role', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'performance', '2004', 'supporting', 'cast', 'consisting', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Jack', 'Thompson', 'others', 'enhanced', 'Penn', 'performance', 'bring', 'out', 'contrasts', 'what', 'Bicke', 'different', 'rest', 'society', 'Altogether', 'Assassination', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'magnificent', 'film', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'world', 'small', 'part', 'humanity', 'experience', 'living', 'fringe', 'society']",N/A
887617,A2T049UQONS0OY,B0007R4SVI,Larry VanDeSande,"[2, 2]","If this is a fact-based story about a disturbed office furniture salesman (Sean Penn) who in 1972 concocted a plot to kill then-President Nixon by hijacking a plane to fly over the White House to drop a gas bomb -- as the Amazon portrait and legend of this film suggests -- the real life story was also the basis for two other cinematic losers: Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"" and the Michael Douglas character in ""Falling Down"".Like Penn's character in this film, those were portraits of losers that took out their inadequacies on an unwary world. There can be little coincidence that the name of Penn's character in the film, Bicke, is close to Bickle, Robert DeNiro's loser in ""Taxi Driver"". Not that I would suggest ""Taxi Driver"" stole anything from a film made 30 years later, but it certainly seems like more than coincidence.The Amazon description also errs is suggesting the action took place in 1972. Maybe the real world action took place then but the movie is based in 1974 at the end of Nixon's presidency. The scenes herein also link the Bicke character (Penn) with the John Hinkley's attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, as Reagan's would-be assassin took his action to impress actress Jody Foster, whom he had seen in ""Taxi Driver"".Are you getting the drift? That this is a perverse story about a psycho that's a loser who thinks he can make good in life by assassinating someone? That's exactly what's going on here although it takes more than an hour to make its essential point with clarity.In the meantime the film has three subplots. First is Penn's inadequacy as a salesman. Second is Penn's failed marriage to a brunette Naomi Watts, as if a fox like that would ever marry and bear chldren with such a loser! Third is Bicke's attempt to start his own business with Don Cheadle, who plays a mechanic and Bicke's best friend, in a scheme to develop a tire store inside a school bus.In one of the film's most comical, touching and realistic sequences, Penn's character goes to the Small Business Administration to apply for a loan to start that business. This appears to be the turning point for the character, who pins all hope of an improved life on getting government assistance to start his ridiculous business venture.This film is carried by the appearances of its three stars and Penn's searing portrayal of Mr. Bicke, who later tries to hijack a plane and fly it into the White House to kill Nixon. This involves a highly disugsting ending full of bloodshed and needless violencee that may or may not have anything to do with reality. I found the ending very disturbing and needlessly operatic, coming after the highly variable and episodic sequences leading to it.So, all told, this is an average film with one good performanace and many debits. It may or may not reflect something that really happened but clearly was modeled after characters from ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Falling Down"". If you liked those movies you'll probably like this one, too. It's not as good as either of them, however.",3,"Searing portrait by Penn, otherwise ordinary",1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,3020,"['fact-based', 'story', 'disturbed', 'office', 'furniture', 'salesman', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'who', '1972', 'concocted', 'plot', 'kill', 'then-President', 'Nixon', 'hijacking', 'plane', 'fly', 'White', 'House', 'drop', 'gas', 'bomb', 'Amazon', 'portrait', 'legend', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'basis', 'two', 'other', 'cinematic', 'losers', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'character', 'Falling', 'Down', 'Penn', 'character', 'film', 'were', 'portraits', 'losers', 'took', 'out', 'inadequacies', 'unwary', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'coincidence', 'name', 'Penn', 'character', 'film', 'Bicke', 'close', 'Bickle', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'loser', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Not', 'would', 'suggest', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'stole', 'anything', 'film', 'made', '30', 'years', 'later', 'certainly', 'more', 'coincidence.The', 'Amazon', 'description', 'also', 'suggesting', 'action', 'took', 'place', '1972', 'Maybe', 'real', 'world', 'action', 'took', 'place', 'then', 'movie', 'based', '1974', 'end', 'Nixon', 'presidency', 'scenes', 'herein', 'also', 'link', 'Bicke', 'character', 'Penn', 'John', 'Hinkley', 'attempted', 'assassination', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'Reagan', 'would-be', 'assassin', 'took', 'action', 'impress', 'actress', 'Jody', 'Foster', 'whom', 'had', 'seen', 'Taxi', 'Driver', '.Are', 'getting', 'drift', 'perverse', 'story', 'psycho', 'loser', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'good', 'life', 'assassinating', 'someone', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'here', 'more', 'hour', 'make', 'essential', 'point', 'clarity.In', 'meantime', 'film', 'three', 'subplots', 'First', 'Penn', 'inadequacy', 'salesman', 'Second', 'Penn', 'failed', 'marriage', 'brunette', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'fox', 'would', 'ever', 'marry', 'bear', 'chldren', 'loser', 'Third', 'Bicke', 'attempt', 'start', 'own', 'business', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'who', 'mechanic', 'Bicke', 'best', 'friend', 'scheme', 'develop', 'tire', 'store', 'school', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'comical', 'touching', 'realistic', 'sequences', 'Penn', 'character', 'Small', 'Business', 'Administration', 'apply', 'loan', 'start', 'business', 'be', 'turning', 'point', 'character', 'who', 'hope', 'improved', 'life', 'getting', 'government', 'assistance', 'start', 'ridiculous', 'business', 'venture.This', 'film', 'carried', 'appearances', 'three', 'stars', 'Penn', 'searing', 'portrayal', 'Mr.', 'Bicke', 'who', 'later', 'hijack', 'plane', 'fly', 'White', 'House', 'kill', 'Nixon', 'highly', 'disugsting', 'ending', 'full', 'bloodshed', 'needless', 'violencee', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'reality', 'found', 'ending', 'very', 'disturbing', 'needlessly', 'operatic', 'coming', 'highly', 'variable', 'episodic', 'sequences', 'leading', 'it.So', 'told', 'average', 'film', 'one', 'good', 'performanace', 'many', 'debits', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'reflect', 'something', 'really', 'happened', 'clearly', 'was', 'modeled', 'characters', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Falling', 'Down', 'liked', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'one', 'too', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'however']",N/A
887618,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0007R4SVI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 5]","Sam Byck was an unemployed tire salesman who attempted to hijack a plane from Baltimore-Washington International Airport on February 22, 1974 so that he could crash it into the White House and kill President Richard M. Nixon.  Byck shot and killed one of the pilots of a DC-9, wounded another, and ordered a passenger to fly the plane.  Shot and wounded by police, he ended up committing suicide and it was discovered he had a gasoline bomb with him.  Byck had first threatened Nixon in 1972 when the Small Business Administration turned down his loan application.  In December of 1973 he was arrested in front of the White House where he was protesting dressed up in a Santa suit holding a sign that said: ""All I want for Christmas is my constitutional right to publicly petition my government for a redress of grievances.""  After his death it was learned Byck had sent a tape recording of his plan to news columnist Jack Anderson, and that he had sent bizarre tape recordings to other public figures including Senator Abraham Ribicoff, Dr. Jonas Salk, and Leonard Bernstein.  Jonas Salk, Abraham Ribicoff, and Leonard Bernstein.Sam Byck is the only one of the title characters in the Stephen Sondheim musical ""Assassins"" who does not get a song.  Instead, Byck is depicted driving to the airport to hijack the plane, dressed up in a Santa suit, while ranting and raving into a tape recorder in a bizarrely funny message.  The guy is portrayed as a nut and throughout the musical he provides more comic relief than you get with the likes of John Wilkes Booth or Lee Harvey Oswald.I provide this background because Niels Mueller's film ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" is ""inspired by a true story"" and is not intended to be a true portrait of Sam Bick even though the end game is reasonably accurate.  That is why this film claims at the end to be a largely fictional dramatization of what happened.  Mueller even changes the name of the character Sean Penn plays to ""Sam Bicke"" and it is important to recognize that what precedes the highjacking attempt at the end of the film is Mueller's own imaginings as to the psychological deterioration that would lead a desperate man to such an insane act (or the other way around).  That is why it is also important to emphasize that this ""Sam Bicke"" is not the zany lunatic of the musical.  He is a creation of this film by Mueller as writer-director and Penn as actor.This Sam Bicke has no social skills, so the idea that he is actually married (but separated) and employed as a office furniture salesman seems improbable.  He is headed for divorce from his wife (Naomi Watts), but for some reason he is hanging on to his job.  His only friend, for lack of a better word, is Bonny Simmons (Don Cheadle), a mechanic who is willing to have Sam over for dinner.  But Sam worries that Bonny lets customers walk all over him and ignores racist attacks.  Sam also thinks the Black Panthers could double membership if they became the Zebras and allowed sympathetic whites, such as Sam, to join.  Sam also believes that salesmen should be able to do their jobs without having to lie and that his idea for painting a bus red and selling tires from it will help him save his marriage and put American business back on the right track.As his life continues to fall apart Sam becomes fixated on Richard Nixon.  Sam's boss, Jack Jones (Jack Thompson), thinks that the president is the ultimate salesman.  Nixon promised to end the Vietnam War in 1968, was elected president, sent more troops, bombed Cambodia, and was re-elected in 1972 by promising to end the war.  As far as Jack is concerned this is as good as it gets.  ""He made us a promise,"" Jack tells Sam, ""he didn't deliver. Then he sold us on the exact same promise and he got elected again.""  Of course, Sam knows that this is wrong and he pours out his heart and his mind to the ""maestro,"" Leonard Bernstein, in a tape recording that he will send off before he goes to meet his destiny.  If Sam had not seen a news story about a disgruntled Army pilot landing a helicopter on the White House lawn, what would he have done instead of what he does do?Penn's performance is perfectly understated as he presents a man who can rarely say what he truly thinks and believes as long as another human being is in the room.  Ironically, when he thinks he is at his best, as when he is talking to the government loan officer about how to sell tires for a 15% mark up, he is only proving how out of touch he is from reality.  In his final act, he proves it to the rest of the world, and Mueller underscores the final cruel irony that the people who mattered most to him did not even notice he was gone.Unfortunately this DVD comes with nothing put ads for other New Line films.  There is nothing about the real history or how Mueller adapted it into this 2004 film.  All you get is the film itself to be accepted or not on its own terms.  But the film and Penn's performance are worth a look, even if you know nothing at all about the true story that inspired it.",4,The mad story of Sam Bicke as a true man (Sam Byck),1114560000,"04 27,

Sean Penn is solid as the would-be lone assassin, while the supporting cast (Don Cheadle, Naomi Watts) never has enough screen time to impress. Only Jack Jones is memorable as Sam's boss at the furniture company.Recurring themes of isolation and powerlessness in society have been done before, to better effect by directors Gus Van Sant and Larry Clark. While the film does a fair job of capturing a microcosm of the nation in 1973, the film is not strong enough to sustain interest of a casual audience. From the first desperate glimpse we get at the main character, we understand this film is going to be a long ride.",3,"A film too small for Sean Penn, better off watching Milk",1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,1070,"['Sam', 'Bicke', 'failure', 'marriage', 'job', 'business', 'idea', 'relationships', 'have', 'left', 'initially', 'pathetic', 'man', 'quite', 'bitter', 'movie', 'not', 'Nixon', 'presidency', 'politics', 'what', 'people', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands.The', 'ending', 'surprise', 'know', 'Nixon', 'presidency', 'ended', 'resignation', 'not', 'assassination', 'Director', 'Niels', 'Mueller', 'precious', 'little', 'hang', 'film', 'meanders', '90', 'minutes', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'solid', 'would-be', 'lone', 'assassin', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'never', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'impress', 'Only', 'Jack', 'Jones', 'memorable', 'Sam', 'boss', 'furniture', 'company.Recurring', 'themes', 'isolation', 'powerlessness', 'society', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'better', 'effect', 'directors', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'film', 'fair', 'job', 'capturing', 'microcosm', 'nation', '1973', 'film', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'sustain', 'interest', 'casual', 'audience', 'first', 'desperate', 'glimpse', 'get', 'main', 'character', 'understand', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'long', 'ride']",N/A

Before this explosion of helpless rage, we see Bicke, a seemingly quiet, almost autistic man, beset by constant loss and failure, relentlessly pushed towards the edge.It is far too easy to see this film as one man's descent into madness, ignoring the world that made him into this.  At the beginning, Bicke seems like a stiff, somewhat timid man who genuinely loves his family and believes in the American Dream.  But in our system of late capitalism, lies and unctuous charm always trump morality.  Bicke is forced to become a low-end salesman to survive, trading on lies to peddle furniture.  Interesting how virtually all reviewers see Bicke as stupid and helpless because he lacks proficiency at lying, not that he is standing up for any sort of moral principle.  How easy it is to heap derision on the little guy like Bicke, rather than the decrepit Godfather of Lies, Richard Nixon.  It is Bicke's inability to play in this abhorrent system that leads to his loss of job, his family, and everything else he loves.Of course, even had Bicke succeeded, Ford would be President a little sooner and the system would have lived on.  But how very sad that they are so proficient at exterminating the good-- Robert F.

887623,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0007R4SVI,mirasreviews,"[5, 6]","""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" is based on the true story of Samuel Byck, who attempted to assassinate the President on February 22nd 1974 by highjacking a commercial airliner with the intention of flying it into the White House. A few details have been changed for the film: For some reason, the spelling of his name has been changed from Byck to Bicke. The film depicts events of Mr. Bicke's life during the year preceding the assassination attempt, but I believe these events actually took place over the course of a couple of years. And the tape recording in which Bicke explains his actions was actually sent to journalist Jack Anderson, not composer Leonard Bernstein. Byck did send Bernstein, among others, some tapes, but not the tape about his assassination plans.Samuel Bicke (Sean Penn) is one of those people who is never able to comprehend how the world works or how to find a place in it. He has lost his job selling tires for his brother and now works as a salesman of office furniture, but is frustrated by his employer's (Jack Thompson) expectations. His wife (Naomi Watts) from whom he has been separated for 2 years has filed for divorce and found a new man. Sam's only friend seems to be Bonny (Don Cheadle), an auto mechanic with whom he hopes to start a tire business if only his small business loan would come through. Sam's a good guy, but not a very functional person. He becomes convinced that he is being denied his share of ""the American Dream"" by the powers that be. And President Richard Nixon becomes the personification of oppression in Sam's mind.Instead of being about the assassination attempt, ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" is a character study of Samuel Bicke. In one of his many notable character performances, Sean Penn manages to make this man sympathetic even though he is only the victim of his own shortcomings. We see that Sam really does suffer in a world that he cannot understand. But we also see how much his friends, family, and the strangers who became his victims suffered for his problems as well. Sam probably couldn't do any better, but he needed to do better nevertheless.

887624,A1KAR9G699RM56,B0007R4SVI,M. Miller,"[2, 2]","Sean Penn has been getting a fair amount of press recently, and not just for Mystic River.  In fact, it was enough coverage to where I was partially fed up with him, and it didn't help that I wasn't impressed with him to begin with.  However, this film changed my mind about that, because Sean Penn did truly help make this film.Oh yes, the film.  Well, the story is based on true events, as you may know, specifically focusing on Samuel J. Bicke.  As you can assume Bicke is the would-be assassin, but how does he get from a frustrated American to that crazed state is what the film is about.So to brief you a bit further on the film itself I'd like to start out with a personal opinion.  Bicke probably always was crazy, and if not crazy he's definitely troubled.  He cannot keep jobs, because he feels his bosses cheat decent people.  Yet, Bicke is not such a saint either, which you see more and more as the film goes on.  In addition, Bicke also has family problems.  This includes a falling-out with his former boss/brother, but also includes disagreements with his soon-to-be ex-wife.Bicke in turn convolutes this insecurity into the loss of the American dream.  Of course that loss ends up being represented by former President Nixon.As I mentioned before the acting pleased me, because this was not traditional Sean Penn, and not only that but it was a tough role.  For instance, Penn is the main character, and is alone for a vast component of the movie (sorry Cheadle fans), just narrarating his thoughts.  Being ""alone"" for that long is hard to actually convey for actors because audiences don't usually feel that isolated, and yet you do get the loneliness feel, almost as much as you did with Tom Hanks and Castaway.To summarize, the film was well done in many ways not just acting, although it may even earn Penn another Oscar.  (Who knows; it's early.)

Based on his appearance in this year's Oscars, he can't seem to recognize a joke if it him in the face (which could explain why he's known for only one real comedy - Fast Times at Ridgemont High - and that was decades ago).  But problematic as he may be as an individual, he is nonetheless a great actor.  The Assassination of Richard Nixon demonstrates again that he is one of the best actors in film today.Based on a true story, this small film follows Penn as Sam Bicke, a man who is a pathetic loser in 1974.  It's not so much that he fails, but that he is the source of his own failure that makes him so pitiful.  As things get worse and worse in his life, he begins to see things as a vast conspiracy against him.  It is not really paranoia in the sense that he doesn't think the system is out to get just him, but rather that it is just out to squash the little guy.As the rage slowly builds in him, Bicke's behavior gets more and more desparate.  He is one of those ""quiet types"" who is impotent when it comes to handling problems rationally.  Finally, Bicke decides that the only way to make a difference is to kill Richard Nixon by flying a plane into the White House.  But, as we all know, Nixon was not killed by Bicke, and this task, like everything in Bicke's life, is doomed to failure.Penn's work in this movie is outstanding, drawing us into this character and making him simultaneously sympathetic and repellent.  Indeed, by being in virtually every scene, this is a showcase for his ability.  Since this is more of a character piece than a plot-driven story, Penn's success makes the movie wonderful as well.

He lacks charm, he lacks a basic capacity for empathy, he is terrible company, he is portrayed as having no coherent insight into the world, nor into himself.  He dislikes liars, hypocrisy, and he likes his moustache and Leonard Bernstein.  It is very hard to care about what happens to him.  It is even harder to believe that he could be married to an apparently balanced and attractive woman (Naomi Watts) for whom he has fathered three children; similarly, the basis of his friendship with Don Cheadle, an African-American car mechanic, is an utter mystery.*The film shows his incipient madness, and then follows him to the pathetic conclusion anticipated by the title.  No explanation for his condition is given.  Presumably there was a reason why his wife married him and stayed with him for years; and another reason why his brother helped him for many more, only to give up on him during the film; and further reasons why he has a friend, despite apparently having nothing in common, and even why a cynical business proprietor takes him under his wing, when clearly he has no innate sales skills - the film, however, does not even hint at what any of these reasons might be.  This leaves the Bicke character static and distant - he does not develop during the film, nor do we have any call to side with him.*In searching for the start of some of the above mentioned reasons, it is tempting to supply the trite answer and assume that Bicke was relatively normal prior to being sent to Vietnam, and crazed on his return; but this is being charitable, since the film does not imply that he is a returned veteran, save for the most tangential reference when Jack Jones, the businessman, praises Nixon for selling America a lie regarding Vietnam not once, but twice.  Such a reading is partly contradicted too by his brother's comment that Sam had 'always been a strange man' - again, one can well ask, and why was he strange - as no mention is made of his parents or upbringing the question remains forever empty.*The performance of Sean Penn, and the movie as a whole, is openly derivative of Scorcese' and De Niro's work in 'Taxi Driver' and 'The King of Comedy'.  However, while the latter two films were blackly funny, and mounted twisted theses as to the motivation of the protagonists, this film is dull and dire, and Bicke's ire against hypocrisy is piecemeal and unconvincing, the prime motivation being his unexplained, and hence largely uninteresting, madness.*While you can buy this film from Amazon for less that two dollars I would strongly advise that you do not: ninety minutes of your own time is far more valuable than that.",1,The Assassination of Ninety Minutes of Your Time.,1149379200,"06 4, 2006",2006,2703,"['Sam', 'Bicke', 'insane', 'also', 'extremely', 'uninteresting', 'charm', 'basic', 'capacity', 'empathy', 'terrible', 'company', 'portrayed', 'having', 'coherent', 'insight', 'world', 'liars', 'hypocrisy', 'moustache', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'very', 'hard', 'care', 'what', 'even', 'harder', 'believe', 'could', 'be', 'married', 'apparently', 'balanced', 'attractive', 'woman', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'whom', 'fathered', 'three', 'children', 'similarly', 'basis', 'friendship', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'African-American', 'car', 'mechanic', 'utter', 'mystery', '*The', 'film', 'incipient', 'madness', 'then', 'pathetic', 'conclusion', 'anticipated', 'title', 'explanation', 'condition', 'given', 'Presumably', 'was', 'reason', 'why', 'wife', 'married', 'stayed', 'years', 'reason', 'why', 'brother', 'helped', 'many', 'more', 'only', 'give', 'up', 'film', 'further', 'reasons', 'why', 'friend', 'apparently', 'having', 'nothing', 'common', 'even', 'why', 'cynical', 'business', 'proprietor', 'wing', 'when', 'clearly', 'innate', 'sales', 'film', 'however', 'not', 'even', 'hint', 'what', 'reasons', 'might', 'be', 'Bicke', 'character', 'static', 'distant', 'not', 'develop', 'film', 'do', 'have', 'call', 'side', '*In', 'searching', 'start', 'above', 'mentioned', 'reasons', 'tempting', 'supply', 'trite', 'answer', 'assume', 'Bicke', 'was', 'relatively', 'normal', 'prior', 'being', 'sent', 'Vietnam', 'crazed', 'return', 'being', 'charitable', 'film', 'not', 'imply', 'returned', 'veteran', 'save', 'most', 'tangential', 'reference', 'when', 'Jack', 'Jones', 'businessman', 'Nixon', 'selling', 'America', 'lie', 'regarding', 'Vietnam', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'Such', 'reading', 'partly', 'contradicted', 'too', 'brother', 'comment', 'Sam', 'had', ""'always"", 'been', 'strange', 'man', 'again', 'one', 'can', 'well', 'ask', 'why', 'was', 'strange', 'mention', 'made', 'parents', 'upbringing', 'question', 'forever', 'empty', '*The', 'performance', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'movie', 'whole', 'openly', 'derivative', 'Scorcese', 'De', 'Niro', 'work', ""'Taxi"", 'Driver', ""'The"", 'King', 'Comedy', 'However', 'latter', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'blackly', 'funny', 'mounted', 'twisted', 'theses', 'motivation', 'protagonists', 'film', 'dull', 'dire', 'Bicke', 'ire', 'hypocrisy', 'piecemeal', 'unconvincing', 'prime', 'motivation', 'being', 'unexplained', 'hence', 'largely', 'uninteresting', 'madness', 'can', 'buy', 'film', 'Amazon', 'less', 'two', 'dollars', 'would', 'strongly', 'advise', 'do', 'not', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'own', 'time', 'far', 'more', 'valuable']",N/A

However, it was, in my opinion, one of the best movies of the year.Based on actual events in 1974, Sean Penn plays Sam Bicke, a cross between Robert DeNiro's character Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver and Penn's character Sam Dawson from I Am Sam. Bicke is an average struggling working class man whose wife left him because he doesn't do what he says. Sam's life has been filled with pipe dreams that never came true because no bank would give him loans. He's also a very poor salesman who loses his job. His wife has custody of his kids who he only has time to play with outside their mother's house. Sam grows sick and outraged at the system he lives in, a system of lies and deceptions and blames it all on the biggest liar in the country, President Richard Nixon, and attempts to hijack a plane and fly it into the white house.The movie is disturbing but very sad.

A person under such severe, constant assault will strike out, rather than die quietly.  I surely feel Sam was an honorable man - crazy, but noble, in a twisted sense. I wonder what the larger story was with him.  He may have been on the downward spiral of paranoid schizophenia, or he might have hit his head in a car accident and lost his mental faculties.

Nothing at all happens for 80 of the pictures 90 min running time but Bicke schlepping around whining and generally annoying everyone around him. Penn is horrifically bad proving once and for all just how godawful THE METHOD is. He basically looks into the camera for 80 minutes and makes faces mumbling throughout. One defies anyone to sit through this and not hit the flashforward button. Repetious and empty, the film may be attempting to make some connection with 9/11 saying that it is all Nixon, American society or the Jew's fault(Bicke was and is portrayed as being a whiny crazy Jew who raves constantly about racism and capitalism) but it is all so badly directed and clumsley dramatized that it could easily be a plea for better training for furniture salesmen.For a truly great Penn performance, see TEAM AMERICA.",1,Bush and the Jews were behind everything even then!!!,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,1335,"['ASSASSINATION', 'OF', 'RICHARD', 'NIXON', '2004', 'Exective', 'produced', 'Leonardo', 'DeCaprio.Starring', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Naomi', 'Watts.Based', 'true', 'story', 'irate', 'furniture', 'salesman', 'named', 'Bicke', 'who', '1974', 'tried', 'hyjack', 'plane', 'fly', 'White', 'House', 'attempt', 'assassinate', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'so', 'give', 'meaning', 'miserable', 'failed', 'life', 'film', 'simply', 'excruciatingly', 'bad', 'flashback', 'turgid', 'New', 'Wave', 'European', 'films', '60s', 'wretched', '70s', 'American', 'versions', 'same', 'Nothing', 'happens', '80', 'pictures', '90', 'min', 'running', 'time', 'Bicke', 'schlepping', 'whining', 'generally', 'annoying', 'everyone', 'Penn', 'horrifically', 'bad', 'proving', 'once', 'just', 'how', 'godawful', 'METHOD', 'basically', 'camera', '80', 'minutes', 'mumbling', 'One', 'anyone', 'sit', 'not', 'hit', 'flashforward', 'button', 'Repetious', 'empty', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'attempting', 'make', 'connection', '9/11', 'saying', 'Nixon', 'American', 'society', 'Jew', 'fault', 'Bicke', 'was', 'portrayed', 'being', 'whiny', 'crazy', 'Jew', 'who', 'constantly', 'racism', 'capitalism', 'so', 'badly', 'directed', 'clumsley', 'dramatized', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'plea', 'better', 'training', 'furniture', 'truly', 'great', 'Penn', 'performance', 'see', 'TEAM', 'AMERICA']",N/A

This movie shows that even though his plan is a little on the crazy side, Sean Penn does his absolute best to portray him as a believable man on a mission.Sam Bike [Sean Penn] is a furniture salesman in 1974. He has been separated from his wife, Marie, for over a year and constantly wants to be a part of her life again, even though she doesn't want to get back together. Marie [Naomi Watts] is a cocktail waitress who supports her family of three children and accuses Sam of stalking her, which he does, but the only problem is that he doesn't see it that way.Meanwhile Sam is struggling to get a job and keep it, after numerous fails in life. Sam is not a man with courage in him or confidence. He almost cringes when he has to start another sale with a different customer everytime they walk throught he front door. To make matters worse his boss [played by Jack Thompson] pushes him almost to the limit on several occasions and never hesitates to critisize him.His furniture job is only temporary, as he tries to get the funding and permission to start a car repair job. He has an auto mechanic [played by Don Cheadle] who helps him out by making sure the bus he uses actually runs. It's basically a bus that has a bunch of tires in it that Sam goes around town to replace flats, but he sees it as more than that and is trying to get clearance to start his job.However bad luck seems to follow Sam everywhere as his letter to start the tire business is rejected, and a few days later divorce papers from Marie arrive at his door. His unfortunate losses culminate into him getting a blind fit of rage that eventually pushes him over the edge. He soon quits his furniture job and spends a good deal of time fuming in his chair in his apartment.This is where Richard Nixon comes into play, because all of Sam's frustrations focuss on him for one reason. Richard Nixon was the world's greatest salesman. After making America vote for him twice, he lied to them about ending the Vietnam War, and corruption started to happen in his office. Maybe it was the line that made Sam think that Nixon was a better salesman than him, something he was working on achieving but never reached it. Whatever it was, Sam figures out the only way to end his frustrations and his hardships is to kill Richard Nixon.The movie is dark in a lot of ways, but it is Sean Penn's role that makes this movie what it is. He is dark, scary, and pitied in almost every scene. There are a lot of smaller scenes in this movie such as him planning out how to get past security checkpoints in the airport, to him even going to a Black Panter's organization at the time to donate money to them to help support them. Every scene Penn is masterful and this is one movie that needs to be seen.Advisory, some language here and there, and the ending of the movie in the airplane hijacking is very violent.

887637,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B0007R4SVI,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[1, 1]","Director:  Niels MuellerCast:  Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, Don Cheadle, Jack Thompson, Brad William Henke.Running Time:  95 minutes.Rated R some violence and language.Sean Penn once again shines in the dreary, yet exhilaratingly dark drama ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"", which oftentimes finds itself in parallel with ""Taxi Driver"" with its main character's continuous and exponential personal deterioration that eventually leads to an act of extreme hatred and violence.  The basic premise of the film revolves around the socially inept furniture salesman Samuel Bicke (Penn) and his incredible journey from being a working man to the epitome of a deadbeat, leading up to his ultimate decision to destroy the yuppie upper-class notion of pre-eminence and fraudulence by killing the current president of the United States of America.  Bicke's metamorphosis is transformed by the depressing everyday events that torment his worthless, selfish life:  his wife and mother of his two children (Naomi Watts) has left him and has started to see another man, his only true friend, an African-American tire store owner (Don Cheadle in a run-of-the-mill performance), has become less supportive of Sam's belief in integrity and rights, his intimidating boss at work (Jack Thompson, with a fine role) all but makes Bicke the laughing stock of the entire firm, and he is still waiting notice for his entrepreneurial company to receive its licensing for production.""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" is not overly exciting by any means, but viewers who enjoy in-depth, thought-provoking films will certainly enjoy this immensely engrossing tale.  Based on the 1974 true story, director Niels Mueller uses his fondness of ""Taxi Driver"" to stage an incredible evolution on film.  The director also uses a great musical score (mostly made up of compositions by the great Beethoven) to firmly allude to Bicke's state throughout the film.  At first, Bicke is a very nice, heartwarming individual who just wants to get his life completely back together, yet by the end of the film, he has completely lost his drive to succeed and he concocts a devilishly evil plan to lash out towards a society who doesn't give a damn about being honest and decent.  Penn is sensational in the role (which rivals his performances in films such as ""I am Sam, ""Mystic River"", and ""21 Grams"") and he has solidified himself as one of the bet actors of the past half decade.  Watts and Cheadle are basically wasted talent with their roles, but Penn is able to save the day.  An intense, riveting look into the mind of a truly maniacal, yet innocent man who just wanted to be successful.  A genuinely fervent tale of the tribulations that society can bring upon its inhabitants.",4,The Assassination of Richard Nixon  (2004),1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,2743,"['Director', 'Niels', 'MuellerCast', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Jack', 'Thompson', 'Brad', 'William', 'Henke.Running', 'Time', '95', 'minutes.Rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language.Sean', 'Penn', 'once', 'again', 'shines', 'dreary', 'yet', 'exhilaratingly', 'dark', 'drama', 'Assassination', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'parallel', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'main', 'character', 'continuous', 'exponential', 'personal', 'deterioration', 'eventually', 'act', 'extreme', 'hatred', 'violence', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'socially', 'inept', 'furniture', 'salesman', 'Samuel', 'Bicke', 'Penn', 'incredible', 'journey', 'being', 'working', 'man', 'epitome', 'deadbeat', 'leading', 'up', 'ultimate', 'decision', 'destroy', 'yuppie', 'upper-class', 'notion', 'pre-eminence', 'fraudulence', 'killing', 'current', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'Bicke', 'metamorphosis', 'transformed', 'depressing', 'everyday', 'events', 'torment', 'worthless', 'selfish', 'life', 'wife', 'mother', 'two', 'children', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'left', 'started', 'see', 'man', 'only', 'true', 'friend', 'African-American', 'tire', 'store', 'owner', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'run-of-the-mill', 'performance', 'become', 'less', 'supportive', 'Sam', 'belief', 'integrity', 'rights', 'intimidating', 'boss', 'work', 'Jack', 'Thompson', 'fine', 'role', 'Bicke', 'laughing', 'stock', 'entire', 'firm', 'still', 'waiting', 'notice', 'entrepreneurial', 'company', 'receive', 'licensing', 'production', 'Assassination', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'not', 'overly', 'exciting', 'means', 'viewers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'in-depth', 'thought-provoking', 'films', 'will', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'immensely', 'engrossing', 'tale', 'Based', '1974', 'true', 'story', 'director', 'Niels', 'Mueller', 'fondness', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'stage', 'incredible', 'evolution', 'film', 'director', 'also', 'great', 'musical', 'score', 'mostly', 'made', 'compositions', 'great', 'Beethoven', 'firmly', 'allude', 'Bicke', 'state', 'film', 'first', 'Bicke', 'very', 'nice', 'heartwarming', 'individual', 'who', 'just', 'get', 'life', 'completely', 'back', 'together', 'yet', 'end', 'film', 'completely', 'lost', 'drive', 'succeed', 'devilishly', 'evil', 'plan', 'lash', 'out', 'towards', 'society', 'who', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'being', 'honest', 'decent', 'Penn', 'sensational', 'role', 'performances', 'films', 'such', 'am', 'Sam', 'Mystic', 'River', '21', 'Grams', 'solidified', 'one', 'bet', 'actors', 'past', 'half', 'decade', 'Watts', 'Cheadle', 'are', 'basically', 'wasted', 'talent', 'roles', 'Penn', 'able', 'save', 'day', 'intense', 'riveting', 'look', 'mind', 'truly', 'maniacal', 'yet', 'innocent', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'successful', 'genuinely', 'fervent', 'tale', 'tribulations', 'society', 'can', 'bring', 'upon', 'inhabitants']",N/A
887638,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007R4SVI,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","The film is based on a real-life event that happened in Baltimore, on Feb. 22nd, 1974.  As the title suggests, one man Samuel J. Bicke (who doesn't look like Sean Penn) thought of an assassination plot, which was covered by the press nationwide, and then forgotten.But screenwriter Niels Mueller couldn't forget this incident, and wrote and directed a film starring Sean Penn as Bicke, who is gradually driven to the very insane idea of killing the president, which ironically reminds us of one terrorist attack on 9/11, 2001.[INTENSE SEAN PENN] But the film is mainly about this person, Sam Bicke, divorced office furniture salesman, who finds the world is full of deceit and injustice.  His ex-wife Marie (Naomi Watts) just is cold to him; his boss Jack (Jack Thompson) is, he believes, cheating the customers; even his friend Bonny (Don Cheadle) doesn't understand anything about his strong belief about money.  Even Bicke keeps recording his obsessive ideas into a tape recorder, and thinks about sending the tapes to Leonard Bernstein.Bicke finally comes to think that Richard Nixon represents the corrupt world.  Believing this is the only way to solve the problems, Bicke does one horrible thing in the end.Probably Niels Mueller doesn't like it, but the comparison is inevitable.  In 'Taxi Driver' we have seen THE film about the man on the brink of insanity.  I'm not saying 'Richard Nixon' is a copy of that DeNiro classic.  The story of DeNiro's Travis is more eventful, more violent, and probably better-paced.  Good as Sean Penn is (and when was he not good anyway?), and his acting shows the vulnerable side of the character (which you cannot find in Travis), his portrait of Sam Bicke is rather monotonous, sometimes overreaches himself.Still, the feeling of the 70s is well re-produced, and there is an unexpected (darkly) funny moments in the office of the Black Panther.  And watching the protagonist falling apart played by Sean Penn is like watching him implode; it is painful, but unforgettable.",4,(3.5 STARS) Sean Penn Implodes; Portrait of a Lonely Soul,1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,2016,"['film', 'based', 'real-life', 'event', 'happened', 'Baltimore', 'Feb.', '22nd', '1974', 'title', 'one', 'man', 'Samuel', 'J.', 'Bicke', 'who', ""n't"", 'look', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'thought', 'assassination', 'plot', 'was', 'covered', 'press', 'nationwide', 'then', 'forgotten.But', 'screenwriter', 'Niels', 'Mueller', 'could', ""n't"", 'forget', 'incident', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'starring', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Bicke', 'who', 'gradually', 'driven', 'very', 'insane', 'idea', 'killing', 'president', 'ironically', 'one', 'terrorist', 'attack', '9/11', '2001', '[', 'INTENSE', 'SEAN', 'PENN', ']', 'film', 'mainly', 'person', 'Sam', 'Bicke', 'divorced', 'office', 'furniture', 'salesman', 'who', 'world', 'full', 'deceit', 'injustice', 'ex-wife', 'Marie', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'just', 'cold', 'boss', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'Thompson', 'cheating', 'customers', 'even', 'friend', 'Bonny', 'Don', 'Cheadle', ""n't"", 'understand', 'anything', 'strong', 'belief', 'money', 'Even', 'Bicke', 'recording', 'obsessive', 'ideas', 'tape', 'recorder', 'sending', 'tapes', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein.Bicke', 'finally', 'think', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'corrupt', 'world', 'Believing', 'only', 'way', 'solve', 'problems', 'Bicke', 'one', 'horrible', 'thing', 'end.Probably', 'Niels', 'Mueller', ""n't"", 'like', 'comparison', 'inevitable', ""'Taxi"", 'Driver', 'have', 'seen', 'THE', 'film', 'man', 'brink', 'insanity', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Nixon', 'copy', 'DeNiro', 'classic', 'story', 'DeNiro', 'Travis', 'more', 'eventful', 'more', 'violent', 'probably', 'better-paced', 'Good', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'anyway', 'acting', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'character', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'Travis', 'portrait', 'Sam', 'Bicke', 'rather', 'monotonous', 'sometimes', 'overreaches', 'himself.Still', 'feeling', '70s', 'well', 're-produced', 'unexpected', 'darkly', 'funny', 'moments', 'office', 'Black', 'Panther', 'watching', 'protagonist', 'falling', 'apart', 'played', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'watching', 'implode', 'painful', 'unforgettable']",N/A

This unstable furniture salesman calls President Nixon a ""liar"" who has sold us a ""dishonest"" bill of goods. He blames Nixon for his own inability to cope and devises a dumb plan to hijack a plane and bomb The White House, thereby ridding America of its ""cancer."" He never gets out of the airport, but this movie about him soars.It takes a while for him to reach the airport, however, which may vex viewers lured by the title to expect ""JFK."" The run-up to the attempt, which ends the film, is actually its subject. Against expectations, the script is interested in how life's reverses and conumdrums turn a dependent personality into a psychotic one. Penn stalks this ordinary man and, drawing upon nuance and suppressed rage, makes him compelling. It is easy to see why the picture and his performance hit so many 2004 ten best lists.He is surrounded by stellar support: Naomi Watts, his estranged wife; Jack Thompson, his unctious employer; and Don Cheadle, his fed-up friend. Although the script takes its time, the sure-footed direction knows where it's going, even if the editing sometimes doesn't. The moody score might have been by Philip Glass (but isn't). In this first DVD transfer, the menu designer would do well to learn how The Criterion Collection does it. This picture is no ensemble piece and Penn, in every scene, is the whole show.
