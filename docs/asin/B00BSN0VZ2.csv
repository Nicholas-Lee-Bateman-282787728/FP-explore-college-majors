Everything and everyone is a bit off when the movie starts and by its end, everyone is completely strange and rather horrifying, especially India. Mia Wasikowska doesn't say much, but her sullen face and watchful eyes convey a darkness that doesn't become fully apparent until the last scenes.

1637925,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00BSN0VZ2,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Visual flare overtakes a strong structure in this breathtaking thriller from Chan-wook Park and Wentworth Miller.  In comes together in unexpected ways, delivering a film that is stunning to look at yet underdeveloped and rather spotty to evaluate.  It feels like half a film, sometimes not even that much, and yet the film's clear assets are almost more than enough to make up for the faltering storyline.I wasn't too keen on seeing the film, to be honest.  I had preconceived notions of what this film was going to be about based on the odd promotional campaign, and the critical reception didn't help convince me I was wrong.  It looked like a glossed over attempt at creating cheap thrills with a supernatural take on the Hitchcock thriller.  In some ways, it is some of those things and yet it isn't.  Despite being underdeveloped, nothing about this film is cheap.  The thrills are genuine mostly because they come with a sense of normalcy.  As the film develops and the true intentions are made clear, the crazy elements carry with them a feeling of natural calm, which helps create a real sense of tension and a haunting sustainability.`Stoker' stays with you.The basic premise follows the events that happen after the death of Richard Stoker.  At the funeral, Richard's daughter India notices a strange figure looming overhead, and soon she is introduced to him.  He is Charlie, her Uncle.  India's mother, Evelyn, was barely aware of Charlie herself, but is instantly smitten with him.  He is charming and almost immediately moves into their home and begins to insert himself into their lives.  Despite obvious warnings to his presence, Evelyn doesn't want to let him go.  Then people start disappearing.  India is dubious, but her sullen demeanor and hostile school life lead her to begin to embrace her darker side, which is aided by the help of her mysterious Uncle.Lights flicker.`Stoker', for me, feels very much like a Brian De Palma film.  It borrows a lot from other films, other directors and their signature styles, and melds them into one fluid movement.  Chan-wook Park single handedly saves Miller's fractured script by giving it a tremendous amount of electricity.  The basics of Miller's script are great and hold promise, but the skeletal handling of the characters and their backstories cause the film itself to feel underwhelming.  There is hinting towards things, instinctual things, that send charges of promise but they are never truly capitalized on.  Nicole Kidman is handed a thankless part, despite a killer scene or two, and Mia Wasikowska has a truly intriguing character to play and yet by the film's end we still feel as though we know nothing about her.But then there is Matthew Goode.  He is brilliant here as the charmingly seductive Charles Stoker.  He looms over every scene with this great sense of presence and awareness, showing such depth perception in every tiny detail.  He's charming, chilling, sexy and confident, but the car scene with Dermot Mulroney is such a magnificent example of internalizing honest emotions and creating a fragility that is needed to sell his character as a whole.With sensational production values (that cinematography is to die for) and a chilling atmosphere thanks to Park's attention to detail, `Stoker' rises above being a poor man's `Carrie' and becomes a respectable horror film complete with memorable moments (that shower scene should become infamous) and a sharp performance by a rising star.",4,Style over substance leaves an undeniable mark...,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,3479,"['Visual', 'flare', 'strong', 'structure', 'breathtaking', 'thriller', 'Chan-wook', 'Park', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'together', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'delivering', 'film', 'stunning', 'look', 'yet', 'underdeveloped', 'rather', 'spotty', 'evaluate', 'film', 'sometimes', 'not', 'even', 'much', 'yet', 'film', 'clear', 'assets', 'are', 'almost', 'more', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'faltering', 'storyline.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'keen', 'seeing', 'film', 'be', 'honest', 'had', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'about', 'based', 'odd', 'promotional', 'campaign', 'critical', 'reception', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'convince', 'was', 'wrong', 'looked', 'glossed', 'attempt', 'creating', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'supernatural', 'take', 'Hitchcock', 'thriller', 'ways', 'things', 'yet', ""n't"", 'being', 'underdeveloped', 'nothing', 'film', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'are', 'genuine', 'mostly', 'come', 'sense', 'normalcy', 'film', 'true', 'intentions', 'are', 'made', 'clear', 'crazy', 'elements', 'carry', 'feeling', 'natural', 'calm', 'create', 'real', 'sense', 'tension', 'haunting', 'sustainability.', 'Stoker', 'stays', 'you.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'events', 'happen', 'death', 'Richard', 'Stoker', 'funeral', 'Richard', 'daughter', 'India', 'strange', 'figure', 'looming', 'overhead', 'soon', 'introduced', 'Charlie', 'Uncle', 'India', 'mother', 'Evelyn', 'was', 'barely', 'aware', 'Charlie', 'instantly', 'smitten', 'charming', 'almost', 'immediately', 'home', 'insert', 'lives', 'obvious', 'warnings', 'presence', 'Evelyn', ""n't"", 'want', 'let', 'go', 'Then', 'people', 'start', 'disappearing', 'India', 'dubious', 'sullen', 'demeanor', 'hostile', 'school', 'life', 'lead', 'begin', 'embrace', 'darker', 'side', 'aided', 'help', 'mysterious', 'Uncle.Lights', 'flicker.', 'Stoker', 'feels', 'very', 'much', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'film', 'lot', 'other', 'films', 'other', 'directors', 'signature', 'styles', 'melds', 'one', 'fluid', 'movement', 'Chan-wook', 'Park', 'single', 'handedly', 'Miller', 'fractured', 'script', 'giving', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'electricity', 'basics', 'Miller', 'script', 'are', 'great', 'hold', 'promise', 'skeletal', 'handling', 'characters', 'backstories', 'cause', 'film', 'feel', 'underwhelming', 'hinting', 'towards', 'things', 'instinctual', 'things', 'send', 'charges', 'promise', 'are', 'never', 'truly', 'capitalized', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'handed', 'thankless', 'part', 'killer', 'scene', 'two', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'truly', 'intriguing', 'character', 'play', 'yet', 'film', 'end', 'still', 'feel', 'know', 'nothing', 'her.But', 'then', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'brilliant', 'here', 'charmingly', 'seductive', 'Charles', 'Stoker', 'scene', 'great', 'sense', 'presence', 'awareness', 'showing', 'such', 'depth', 'perception', 'tiny', 'detail', 'charming', 'chilling', 'sexy', 'confident', 'car', 'scene', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'such', 'magnificent', 'example', 'internalizing', 'honest', 'emotions', 'creating', 'fragility', 'needed', 'sell', 'character', 'whole.With', 'sensational', 'production', 'values', 'cinematography', 'die', 'chilling', 'atmosphere', 'thanks', 'Park', 'attention', 'detail', 'Stoker', 'rises', 'being', 'poor', 'man', 'Carrie', 'respectable', 'horror', 'film', 'complete', 'memorable', 'moments', 'shower', 'scene', 'should', 'become', 'infamous', 'sharp', 'performance', 'rising', 'star']",Stoker
1637926,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00BSN0VZ2,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Mia Wasikowska stars in a movie that requires a tremendous amount of patience on your part to appreciate since let's be honest, the first 30 minutes are reprehensible- this portion of the film is all about Mia's character roaming around the house and doing very little in the way of anything significant for storyline purposes.  Your impression here is that Stoker isn't going to be the horror or suspense you're looking for, and even though the film improves later on, you'd still be correct about that.  This is not a horror or suspense.  It's a slow-moving, overproduced Twilight-resembling horror movie for people who can't handle true horror.  Certainly several notches below a *real* horror such as another movie I also watched today called Silent Night.  It's extremely slow-moving and ineffective, believe me.It's basically about Mia being an introverted and shy teenage girl that gets picked on at school by a few guys for being so different, and even has to defend herself against one of them one night during a night of fun gone wrong that involves rape (which results in one of only two actual parts in the movie that *almost* comes close to providing suspense, both involving belts interestingly enough).  Mia's uncle moves in and lives with her family, and it's soon discovered that he's a murderer.  He's definitely the source of confusion when it comes to trying to understand the storyline, that's for sure.This storyline is definitely one of the more confusing ones out there.  There's a scene later on when the uncle is sitting in the car with another man, and a little boy is making snow angels in the dirt as a pushmower moves forward mowing by itself.  The segments with Mia walking to the basement and discovering unusual things in the freezer are equally confusing, not to mention a failed attempt at being atmospheric and frightening as well.  These parts of Stoker make zero sense to me, and eventually the movie reverts back to being boring and confusing like it was in the beginning when Mia was allowing spiders to crawl up her legs.  However if you interpret all this confusion to simply mean the uncle is a psychotic murderer, which is the safe and logical route, than you'd probably be able to appreciate/understand this movie better.  When the relationship between Mia and her uncle builds and becomes intimate, and when the mother makes a few appearances (who has her own relationship with the uncle apparently)... now I'm *really* lost.I do love the piano scene however, where Mia and her uncle play an extended piano piece together (even though Mia was obviously uncomfortable doing so!)  The music played here is terrific, and a wonderful moment of writing.  I also like how, in the very next segment, Nancy Sinatra's ""Summer Wine"" plays.  Interesting sidenote- I knew it was Nancy Sinatra the moment the song began and this is the first time I've even heard the song!  She has a distinct voice and is famous for another classic song in ""Some Velvet Morning"" with Lee Hazlewood.  That's how I knew it was her.Needless to say, Stoker is a strange movie but it's not bad enough to place it with the 1-star reviews you see here on amazon.  Some of the storytelling makes sense, and some of it is even interesting (such as the middle part of the movie).  It's the slow beginning and the confusing 20 minutes near the end that raises a feeling of uncertainty.  At least the two bloody scenes at the very end are magnificent.",3,"hard to believe this movie improves but it does, really!",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,3456,"['Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'movie', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'patience', 'part', 'appreciate', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'reprehensible-', 'portion', 'film', 'Mia', 'character', 'roaming', 'house', 'doing', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'anything', 'significant', 'storyline', 'purposes', 'impression', 'here', 'Stoker', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'horror', 'suspense', ""'re"", 'looking', 'even', 'film', 'later', ""'d"", 'still', 'be', 'correct', 'not', 'horror', 'suspense', 'slow-moving', 'overproduced', 'Twilight-resembling', 'horror', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'true', 'horror', 'Certainly', 'several', 'notches', '*real*', 'horror', 'such', 'movie', 'also', 'watched', 'today', 'called', 'Silent', 'Night', 'extremely', 'slow-moving', 'ineffective', 'believe', 'me.It', 'basically', 'Mia', 'being', 'introverted', 'shy', 'teenage', 'girl', 'picked', 'school', 'few', 'guys', 'being', 'so', 'different', 'even', 'defend', 'one', 'one', 'night', 'night', 'fun', 'gone', 'wrong', 'rape', 'results', 'one', 'only', 'two', 'actual', 'parts', 'movie', 'close', 'providing', 'suspense', 'involving', 'belts', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'Mia', 'uncle', 'moves', 'lives', 'family', 'soon', 'discovered', 'murderer', 'definitely', 'source', 'confusion', 'when', 'trying', 'understand', 'storyline', 'sure.This', 'storyline', 'definitely', 'one', 'more', 'confusing', 'ones', 'there', 'scene', 'later', 'when', 'uncle', 'sitting', 'car', 'man', 'little', 'boy', 'making', 'snow', 'angels', 'dirt', 'pushmower', 'forward', 'mowing', 'segments', 'Mia', 'walking', 'basement', 'discovering', 'unusual', 'things', 'freezer', 'are', 'equally', 'confusing', 'not', 'mention', 'failed', 'attempt', 'being', 'atmospheric', 'frightening', 'as', 'well', 'parts', 'Stoker', 'make', 'zero', 'sense', 'eventually', 'movie', 'back', 'being', 'boring', 'confusing', 'was', 'beginning', 'when', 'Mia', 'was', 'allowing', 'spiders', 'crawl', 'up', 'legs', 'However', 'interpret', 'confusion', 'simply', 'mean', 'uncle', 'psychotic', 'murderer', 'safe', 'logical', 'route', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate/understand', 'movie', 'better', 'When', 'relationship', 'Mia', 'uncle', 'builds', 'becomes', 'intimate', 'when', 'mother', 'few', 'appearances', 'who', 'own', 'relationship', 'uncle', 'apparently', 'now', ""'m"", '*really*', 'lost.I', 'do', 'love', 'piano', 'scene', 'however', 'where', 'Mia', 'uncle', 'play', 'extended', 'piano', 'piece', 'together', 'even', 'Mia', 'was', 'obviously', 'uncomfortable', 'doing', 'so', 'music', 'played', 'here', 'terrific', 'wonderful', 'moment', 'writing', 'also', 'how', 'very', 'next', 'segment', 'Nancy', 'Sinatra', 'Summer', 'Wine', 'plays', 'Interesting', 'sidenote-', 'knew', 'was', 'Nancy', 'Sinatra', 'moment', 'song', 'began', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'even', 'heard', 'song', 'distinct', 'voice', 'famous', 'classic', 'song', 'Velvet', 'Morning', 'Lee', 'Hazlewood', 'how', 'knew', 'was', 'her.Needless', 'say', 'Stoker', 'strange', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'place', '1-star', 'reviews', 'see', 'here', 'amazon', 'storytelling', 'sense', 'even', 'interesting', 'such', 'middle', 'part', 'movie', 'slow', 'beginning', 'confusing', '20', 'minutes', 'end', 'feeling', 'uncertainty', 'least', 'two', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'very', 'end', 'are', 'magnificent']",Stoker

1637930,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00BSN0VZ2,California Dreaming,"[1, 1]","While watching, I actually thought, ""Wow.  If Jerry Brudos were still alive, he'd really like this film.""  After all, there were at least a couple of major plot elements that Mr. Brudos would like about ""Stoker.""  But Mr. Brudos didn't really have good taste overall, so maybe he wouldn't like this film after all?If the first paragraph is a little too obscure, you may surely do a quick Google search and get a good idea to what I'm referring.  But I would recommend against it I suppose, as it might be a minor spoiler.  Even still, after watching this film, I'm not completely sure that I even understand what it's completely about myself.But I surely did appreciate it.  The art direction is fantastic in nearly every way, and there was one scene in particular that I liked:  there was a fade-in to an outdoor scene, and it looked to me just like a Renoir painting.  Renoir was one of the only ""modernists"" that I actually like, if you could consider him ""modern"" though.  After all, most of his life took place in the 1800s, so most people probably consider him to be old fashioned.And this film has some old fashioned elements to it as well.  Note the script on some hand-written letters at one point; it looks like something written for the film ""Dracula.""  (When I first heard the title for the film, I thought of ""Dracula"" because of the obvious Bram Stoker connection.  Was that intended by the screenwriter?)  And ""Stoker"" feels like an Indie film, albeit an Indie film with a whole lot of money thrown at it.  Money that, from most reviews so far, looks like it was perhaps wasted.But it wasn't wasted on me.  While I surely wouldn't consider this to be a ""masterpiece,"" it is really good, and the acting is top notch.  In particular, I really liked Mia Wasikowska who has the lead role.  She has that Christina-Ricci-thing going on, although I believe that Ms. Wasikowska is a better actress than Ms. Ricci.  (Sorry, Ricci fans.  Hey, I happen to be a minor fan myself.)  Matthew Goode is very good himself, and of course Nicole Kidman puts out her standard stellar performance.  (If I were a director, I would give a sigh of relief if Ms. Kidman signed on to do my film.  Why?  Well, you wouldn't have to worry about her.  You know that she's always going to ""bring it"" with every role.)What is this film about, though?  Well, besides the hints that I gave in the first paragraph, it's not completely clear, even after a viewing.  It's difficult to tell even while watching what is real, and what is imagined.  I will say though that it seems like a major theme is ""Crazy doesn't fall far from the tree.""  But if you wanted to discuss plot, this film has a real non-linear narrative going on with lots of flashbacks, and scenes that might be confusing.  This is surely not for the masses, but I really liked it a lot.And once again, Mr. Brudos would surely like to take a peek at this, wherever he is, most likely in the same place as some of the unfortunate characters in this film.  And he's only slightly less sympathetic than quite a few characters here, as they have some very odd hobbies themselves.",4,Great Art Direction,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,3119,"['watching', 'actually', 'thought', 'Wow', 'Jerry', 'Brudos', 'were', 'still', 'alive', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'film', 'were', 'least', 'couple', 'major', 'plot', 'elements', 'Mr.', 'Brudos', 'would', 'like', 'Stoker', 'Mr.', 'Brudos', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'good', 'taste', 'overall', 'so', 'maybe', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'first', 'paragraph', 'little', 'too', 'obscure', 'may', 'surely', 'do', 'quick', 'Google', 'search', 'get', 'good', 'idea', 'what', ""'m"", 'referring', 'would', 'recommend', 'suppose', 'might', 'be', 'minor', 'spoiler', 'Even', 'still', 'watching', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'even', 'understand', 'what', 'completely', 'myself.But', 'surely', 'did', 'appreciate', 'art', 'direction', 'fantastic', 'nearly', 'way', 'there', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'liked', 'was', 'fade-in', 'outdoor', 'scene', 'looked', 'just', 'Renoir', 'painting', 'Renoir', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'modernists', 'actually', 'could', 'consider', 'modern', 'most', 'life', 'took', 'place', '1800s', 'so', 'most', 'people', 'probably', 'consider', 'be', 'old', 'fashioned.And', 'film', 'old', 'fashioned', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'Note', 'script', 'hand-written', 'letters', 'one', 'point', 'something', 'written', 'film', 'Dracula', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'title', 'film', 'thought', 'Dracula', 'obvious', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'connection', 'intended', 'screenwriter', 'Stoker', 'feels', 'Indie', 'film', 'Indie', 'film', 'whole', 'lot', 'money', 'thrown', 'Money', 'most', 'reviews', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'perhaps', 'wasted.But', 'was', ""n't"", 'wasted', 'surely', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'particular', 'really', 'liked', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'who', 'lead', 'role', 'Christina-Ricci-thing', 'going', 'believe', 'Ms.', 'Wasikowska', 'better', 'actress', 'Ms.', 'Ricci', 'Sorry', 'Ricci', 'fans', 'Hey', 'happen', 'be', 'minor', 'fan', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'very', 'good', 'course', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'out', 'standard', 'stellar', 'performance', 'were', 'director', 'would', 'give', 'sigh', 'relief', 'Ms.', 'Kidman', 'signed', 'do', 'film', 'Why', 'Well', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'know', 'always', 'going', 'bring', 'role', 'What', 'film', 'Well', 'hints', 'gave', 'first', 'paragraph', 'not', 'completely', 'clear', 'even', 'viewing', 'difficult', 'tell', 'even', 'watching', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'imagined', 'will', 'say', 'major', 'theme', 'Crazy', ""n't"", 'fall', 'far', 'tree', 'wanted', 'discuss', 'plot', 'film', 'real', 'non-linear', 'narrative', 'going', 'lots', 'flashbacks', 'scenes', 'might', 'be', 'confusing', 'surely', 'not', 'masses', 'really', 'liked', 'lot.And', 'once', 'again', 'Mr.', 'Brudos', 'would', 'surely', 'take', 'peek', 'wherever', 'most', 'likely', 'same', 'place', 'unfortunate', 'characters', 'film', 'only', 'slightly', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'quite', 'few', 'characters', 'here', 'have', 'very', 'odd', 'hobbies']",Stoker

Despite his charm, India feels an instant sense of unease around her uncle, but the darkness hiding beneath his perfect exterior slowly draws the two of them together.

There is no SHADOW OF A DOUBT where its influence lies, but that is besides the point. Park is able to take the clinically-clean surroundings of high society and entrap them in a supremely sinister mood. STOKER plays on societal taboos from the very start, causing the audience to cringe during scenes of forbidden lust and desire. The constant sense of sexual tension is unyielding, and is broken only by the frequent bouts of black comedy. Park is a tactile director, and arouses each of the senses directly through the screen. Our heroine, India, steps right out of the pages of classic literature as she embarks on her journey in to womanhood, however unconventional the means may be. With a winning cast and strongly-driven suspense, STOKER holds a certain appeal to the mystery seekers and purveyors of more traditional Hitchcockian thrillers.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,ILHM Reviews: Stoker,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,1443,"['India', 'left', 'own', 'dark', 'devices', 'death', 'father', 'self-imposed', 'seclusion', 'interrupted', 'arrival', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'who', 'invited', 'stay', 'house', 'mother', 'request', 'charm', 'India', 'instant', 'sense', 'unease', 'uncle', 'darkness', 'hiding', 'perfect', 'exterior', 'slowly', 'two', 'together', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', 'master', 'modern', 'suspense', 'Stygian', 'drama', 'style', 'grace', 'great', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'STOKER', 'kindly', 'homage', 'SHADOW', 'A', 'DOUBT', 'where', 'influence', 'lies', 'point', 'Park', 'able', 'take', 'clinically-clean', 'surroundings', 'high', 'society', 'entrap', 'supremely', 'sinister', 'mood', 'STOKER', 'societal', 'taboos', 'very', 'start', 'causing', 'audience', 'cringe', 'scenes', 'forbidden', 'lust', 'desire', 'constant', 'sense', 'sexual', 'tension', 'unyielding', 'broken', 'only', 'frequent', 'bouts', 'black', 'comedy', 'Park', 'tactile', 'director', 'senses', 'directly', 'screen', 'heroine', 'India', 'steps', 'right', 'pages', 'classic', 'literature', 'journey', 'womanhood', 'however', 'unconventional', 'means', 'may', 'be', 'winning', 'cast', 'strongly-driven', 'suspense', 'STOKER', 'certain', 'appeal', 'mystery', 'seekers', 'purveyors', 'more', 'traditional', 'Hitchcockian', 'thrillers.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Stoker

This won't be a movie for everyone--it is quiet and subtle and the tension within it builds very slowly.  It's not going to jump out and bash you in the face, which many movie-goers prefer in a Michael Bay world, so if you're looking for something a bit more obvious or in the realm of the fast-paced pulse-pounder, then you're going to want to skip this.  But if you appreciate something built on mood and tension, then Stoker should be a great match for you.The film is beautifully shot--the visuals are amazing, and at many points it feels like you could randomly pause the image and have a beautiful work of art to frame.  The story itself runs closely to Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt in its premise, though it doesn't follow it exactly.  The actors that play the members of the Stoker family all do an excellent job of portraying characters that are ""off,"" though charismatic.  The movie does occasionally broadcast its direction a bit too soon, ruining a few of the ""twists"" within it, but the overall impression is a dark, twisted coming of age tale that disturbs and fits well into the Hicthcockian vein of suspense/horror.

1637939,A3UR9M6DLAXTU7,B00BSN0VZ2,Colby,"[47, 53]","Stoker is the type of film you don't see very often. It has a small cast with huge star power, a brilliant script, expertly crafted design in both set and costume, and a truly fascinating story. The film is told less through dialogue and more through action, facial expression, and the imagery of a scene. Stoker doesn't spoon-feed its audience. It expects them to be attentive and alert, ready to come to their own conclusions.As a horror film it is strangely elegant. As a romance film it is quite disturbing. As a coming-of-age film, it is simply chilling!Nicole Kidman, Matthew Goode, and Mia Wasikowska all provide some wonderful acting here. Kidman's talent is to be expected, but Goode and Wasikowska are especially impressive. Matthew Goode is nearly unrecognizable in his emotions on display here and Mia Wasikowska completely owns the role. Its hard to take your eyes off these characters.The elegance of the set and costume design is surprising, giving the film an unusual style; the shifts in tone contrasted with the various designs often times creates a sense of disorientation yet overflows with beauty. The camera dances in expertly crafted movements, which is never a distraction, giving the film another layer of polish.Music and sound design is expertly crafted as well. Classical piano and strings fill the score, while the sounds of the Stoker House are startlingly clear (due to a character's ability to hear extremely well). The sound of India cracking an egg, for example, will surprise many viewers. She is in-tune with the world around her, and the sound design helps create this illusion flawlessly.This truly is one of the more interesting films of the past few years, one which cinephiles will eat up and more casual viewers should be intrigued by. Film: 4.5/5 STARSThe blu-ray's video quality is superb. Closeups are stunning and the cinematography is gorgeous, presented neatly in 1080pHD. Colors burst and black levels are excellent. Video: 4.5/5 STARSAudio is a real highlight here. Like I said, Stoker sounds great. The music, the sound effects, its all captured well on the blu-ray. Dialogue is easy to hear as it moves around the sound-stage. Audio: 5/5 STARSExtras include Deleted Scenes, Making Of videos, Photo galleries, and more. While most of the extra material is nice to watch, it doesn't spoon-feed the audience more answers and leaves the film's ambiguity intact. There isn't a commentary track. Extras: 3.5/5 STARSOverall: 4.5/5 STARS. Stoker is a dark coming-of-age-horror-romance-mystery done very well and it has been given a wonderful blu-ray release.Rating: R.

1637943,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00BSN0VZ2,C. Sawin,"[2, 5]","""Stoker"" is South Korean director Park Chan-wook's first English-language film. After The Vengeance Trilogy (especially ""Oldboy"") and ""Thirst,"" which is one of the most original vampire films to be released in recent years, Park Chan-wook should have already been a fairly recognized name going into ""Stoker."" However, since ""Stoker"" is a bit scaled back when compared to his other works; it's a pretty solid introduction to an extremely talented filmmaker.India (Mia Wasikowska) has just lost her father to a car accident. Since they were relatively close with one another, India isn't taking the loss very well. She is incredibly withdrawn, doesn't speak much, and her behavior is unusual. India's mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) is only barely keeping it together as she's trying to move on with her life, but her defense mechanism kicks in whenever somebody brings up her husband's name. Charlie (Matthew Goode), an uncle India never even knew existed, moves in and makes matters even more uncomfortable than they already are. His questionable motives only pique India's fascination with Charlie and the Stoker family becomes more than a little unsettling because of it.The opening and ending credits make it a point to be unlike most credit sequences out there. The text in the opening of the film interacts with whoever is on-screen like when Mia Wasikowska walks across a road in the middle of nowhere and her name slowly disappears as she walks towards it. The end credits scroll the opposite way you're used to; from top to bottom rather than bottom to top. Pay particular attention to how sound is utilized. The metronome sequence is done extremely well as is the importance of a ringing phone.The psychological thriller heavily relies on creepy and disturbing behavior that continues to snowball throughout its 98-minute duration. We witness India pop a blister on her toe and the film plays with how keen her sense of hearing is. The long-shot of the camera following India through the house is intriguing, but even more so is the way the film transitions from one scene to the next; a hard-boiled egg slowly turns into India's eye and Evelyn's brushed hair becomes the tall grass in the field India and her father are hunting in.The Uncle Charlie character causes every situation to almost feel like a bad punch line to what was already a really bad joke to begin with. These situations make your upper lip curl, your nostrils flare, and your face distort automatically in disgust. Charlie's dialogue alone (""India practically licked it clean"") is awkward enough, but he hangs out at her high school, makes out with her mom when he knows she's watching, and makes playing piano with someone feel like a porno. However, the film is supposed to make you fidget in your seat and make you uneasy and ""Stoker"" is able to do this with the greatest of ease.You're immediately drawn to everyone's eyes in the film. The dinner scene where Charlie lets India drink some of his wine is what first comes to mind, but Evelyn's speech to India near the end of the film is also a great example. Their eyes are just so absorbing, unflinching, and cold.

The magnetism of the film beings while the credits are being shown over the background of a beautifully wooded area where a girl is walking toward a roadside.  The voice over, that of the main character India Stoker, states `My ears hear what others cannot hear; small faraway things people cannot normally see are visible to me. These senses are the fruits of a lifetime of longing, longing to be rescued, to be completed. Just as the skirt needs the wind to billow, I'm not formed by things that are of myself alone. I wear my father's belt tied around my mother's blouse, and shoes which are from my uncle. This is me. Just as a flower does not choose its color, we are not responsible for what we have come to be. Only once you realize this do you become free, and to become adult is to become free.'The plot can be summarized as follows without providing information that would destroy the suspenseful movement of this strange story: India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) was not prepared to lose her father and best friend Richard (Dermot Mulroney) in a tragic auto accident. The solitude of her woodsy family estate, the peace of her tranquil town, and the unspoken somberness of her home life are suddenly upended by not only this mysterious accident, but by the sudden arrival of her Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), whom she never knew existed. When Charlie moves in with her and her emotionally unstable mother Evie (Nicole Kidman), India thinks the void left by her father's death is finally being filled by his closest bloodline. Soon after his arrival, India comes to suspect that this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives. Yet instead of feeling outrage or horror, this friendless young woman becomes increasingly infatuated with him. Yet it is on her 18th birthday that things dramatically change. There are plot twists that defy expectations in this movie whose elegant creativity is the biggest twist of all.The musical score for the film is the work of Clint Mansell who repeatedly inserts excerpts from Verdi's opera `Il Trovatore' - the aria `Stride la Vampa' sung by the ominous gypsy Azucena (`Screeches the blaze!&#8232;The restless mob&#8232;runs to the fire&#8232;with happy faces'). Every detail of this polished thriller has been expertly conceived.  The strong supporting cast includes Phyllis Somerville, Jacki Weaver, Lucas Till, Alden Ehrenreich and others.

The three main leads are perfectly cast and carry the entire film between them. The brooding atmosphere established in the first 60 minutes or so is carefully designed to give you no idea how it will end - and the ending is definitely a surprise.It's beautifully shot, carefully paced, and the horror is neatly set up in the clinical environment of this highly dysfunctional family's home. The plot cleverly plays with social taboos and there's a creepingly sinister aspect to all of the characters as we see them develop. As the revelations are delivered in the last act, there are some real surprises that would be simply unbelievable in the hands of a less talented writer or director.Stoker shows how effective horror can be when it's done well. When compared with the utter garbage offered by films such as Sinister or Mama, Stoker shines and illustrates how CGI monsters are never going to be more disturbing than human behavior.

1637964,A2LU1XQU394ZL3,B00BSN0VZ2,"Jennifer Windham ""Book and Movie Lover""","[5, 7]","When people talk about a guilty pleasure, they are surely thinking of this movie. It's one of those movies that you really, really enjoy watching...while at the same time you feel as though you are wrong for enjoying it quite as much as you do.After India's father dies, her uncle appears unexpectedly and takes up residence in the house. It quickly becomes apparent that his chief interest is India herself, though in the beginning, we're unsure exactly what his final motives are. He and India move through the movie like silent chess players, with one player countering the moves of the other. As the movie progresses we see the attraction between the two begin to build and intensify. Even as India tries to keep aloof, the pull she feels toward her uncle starts to break down her barriers.  It's obvious that Uncle Charlie is interested in being 'more than just friends' (if you catch my meaning), and even though you know that should gross you out, instead you find yourself falling for his allure right along with India and her mother.  Instead of feeling revulsion, you feel the same wickedly sensual awakening that is pulling at India.Uncle Charlie is brilliantly played by Mathew Goode, who mixes just enough charm with his creepiness to keep the audience fascinated with him.  He smoothly inserts himself into the family dynamic and begins to seduce both mother and daughter.  He seduces the audience as well, and much like the mother (played by an almost invisible Kidman), we should know better than to fall for his ploys...but we can't quite help ourselves.India is the real mystery in this story.  Even before Uncle Charlie's arrival, she is a dark, strange girl.  And the watcher is never quite sure if she is a damaged young girl being exploited after her father's death, or if she's been waiting her whole life for Uncle Charlie to show up and awaken what was already lurking in her soul.  Or maybe both.Chan-wook plays with the tensions between India and her Uncle, both sexual and otherwise, like a musical crescendo, rising and falling away.  In fact, one of the more brilliant scenes in the movie is when Uncle Charlie and India are sitting at the piano playing a duet;  and the musical tension builds and builds, rushing toward the final chords,  when suddenly Uncle Charlie simply stops playing and India is left alone, pecking out the last few notes by herself, feeling very unfinished and unsatisfied.  Chan-wook does this through the whole movie, building the tension and attraction to unbearable heights, then letting it slip away, only to build it back up again.By the way, nothing actually happens between uncle and niece, but that taboo foreshadowing of incest helps build the framework for the uncle's more sinister motive...awakening a fledgling killer who can be his partner in murder. Uncle Charlie sees India as the perfect soul mate to his quiet insanity. But does the real danger lie with the uncle or with India herself?Beside the plot sucking you in, the choreography is also beautifully shot; and every scene and camera movement flows with the story into a wonderfully menacing waltz that demands you dance along with it.  Woo turns murder and psychopathy into art, and the watcher is left with the uncomfortable realization that they found it beautiful.",5,"A beautifully wrought, darkly attractive guilty pleasure",1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,3295,"['When', 'people', 'talk', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'are', 'surely', 'thinking', 'movie', 'one', 'movies', 'really', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'feel', 'are', 'wrong', 'enjoying', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'do.After', 'India', 'father', 'uncle', 'unexpectedly', 'up', 'residence', 'house', 'quickly', 'apparent', 'chief', 'interest', 'India', 'though', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'unsure', 'exactly', 'what', 'final', 'motives', 'are', 'India', 'move', 'movie', 'silent', 'chess', 'players', 'one', 'player', 'countering', 'moves', 'other', 'movie', 'see', 'attraction', 'two', 'begin', 'build', 'intensify', 'Even', 'India', 'keep', 'aloof', 'pull', 'uncle', 'break', 'down', 'barriers', 'obvious', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'interested', 'being', ""'more"", 'just', 'friends', 'catch', 'meaning', 'even', 'know', 'should', 'gross', 'out', 'instead', 'find', 'falling', 'allure', 'right', 'India', 'mother', 'Instead', 'feeling', 'revulsion', 'feel', 'same', 'wickedly', 'sensual', 'awakening', 'pulling', 'India.Uncle', 'Charlie', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Mathew', 'Goode', 'who', 'just', 'enough', 'charm', 'creepiness', 'keep', 'audience', 'fascinated', 'smoothly', 'family', 'dynamic', 'seduce', 'mother', 'daughter', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'much', 'mother', 'played', 'almost', 'invisible', 'Kidman', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'fall', 'ploys', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'help', 'ourselves.India', 'real', 'mystery', 'story', 'Even', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'arrival', 'dark', 'strange', 'girl', 'watcher', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'damaged', 'young', 'girl', 'being', 'exploited', 'father', 'death', 'been', 'waiting', 'whole', 'life', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'show', 'up', 'awaken', 'what', 'was', 'already', 'lurking', 'soul', 'maybe', 'both.Chan-wook', 'plays', 'tensions', 'India', 'Uncle', 'sexual', 'otherwise', 'musical', 'crescendo', 'rising', 'falling', 'away', 'fact', 'one', 'more', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'movie', 'when', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'India', 'are', 'sitting', 'piano', 'playing', 'duet', 'musical', 'tension', 'builds', 'builds', 'rushing', 'final', 'chords', 'when', 'suddenly', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'simply', 'playing', 'India', 'left', 'alone', 'pecking', 'out', 'last', 'few', 'notes', 'herself', 'feeling', 'very', 'unfinished', 'unsatisfied', 'Chan-wook', 'whole', 'movie', 'building', 'tension', 'attraction', 'unbearable', 'heights', 'then', 'letting', 'away', 'only', 'build', 'back', 'up', 'way', 'nothing', 'actually', 'uncle', 'niece', 'taboo', 'foreshadowing', 'incest', 'build', 'framework', 'uncle', 'more', 'sinister', 'motive', 'awakening', 'fledgling', 'killer', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'partner', 'murder', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'India', 'perfect', 'soul', 'mate', 'quiet', 'insanity', 'real', 'danger', 'lie', 'uncle', 'India', 'plot', 'sucking', 'choreography', 'also', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'scene', 'camera', 'movement', 'story', 'wonderfully', 'menacing', 'waltz', 'dance', 'Woo', 'murder', 'psychopathy', 'art', 'watcher', 'left', 'uncomfortable', 'realization', 'found', 'beautiful']",Stoker

When it didn't last long in the movies, I thought it must be a dud. Boy was I surprised!I really enjoyed this film. There are some parts that are a bit creepy in a weird way but if you pay attention, everything makes perfect sense. And there are some real surprises.The basic premise is very easy to figure out and isn't hidden. There are two plot twists that are masked until the end. I loved the fact that the movie builds tension very well and is wonderfully stylish. Nicole Kidman is perfect as the mother raising a strange daughter, and it's clear early on that Kidman doesn't have all the lights on upstairs either! Then, just when you think you know what is going on with Uncle Charlie, actor Matthew Goode, something unexpectant happens and the connection between Charlie and India (the little girl) makes sense. The only thing I didn't understand (without giving away too much of the plot) is how Charlie knew that India was strange. He wrote that in his letters, but it was never explained why he would think they had a connection - unless his brother, India's father (actor Dermot Mulroney) - told him.

1637976,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00BSN0VZ2,Mark Turner,"[4, 5]","My guess is that while some may decipher what is going on in the new DVD release STOKER before the final moments of the film, most will not. And the honest truth is that this can be a good thing. It's rare that a film will offer you moments of sheer unease like this film does, but when it does so this effectively you'll end up with a movie that's unlike any other and quite original.Mia Wasikowska plays India Stoker, a young woman whose father has just died in a tragic accident. Early on as the film opens to her voice over and scenes from her past, we know that India is nothing if not unusual. It's her birthday and every year she gets the same gift from her father, a new pair of shoes to replace her old ones. But what will happen now?It's at the funeral that we get a better glimpse of the rest of the family. India's mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) is a wife who seems a bit off as well. While playing the distraught widow she seems as if she's walking through life not caring about much. The distance between mother and daughter comes up throughout the film. India was definitely daddy's daughter and mom was just someone who seems to think more about herself than India.At the funeral India meets her uncle, Charlie (Matthew Goode). Charlie was rarely seen or heard of. In fact India wasn't quite aware that he existed at all. But her mother seems to take well to him and he ends up staying with them in their house to help out. All of this seems to point towards the usual relationship between the widow and the ""missing"" brother that we've seen in so many films. But those hints are never so certain here as more is going on than we realize.The first odd thing that happens is when Mrs. McGarrick the housekeeper suddenly disappears. This was a woman who got along fine with India but who was last seen having words with Charlie. As viewers we assume what possibly happened but there is no proof, no scene that displays what happened or could have happened.Then India's grandmother Gwendolyn (Jacki Weaver) shows. She has some reservations about Charlie but won't share them out loud. When she tries to discuss them with her daughter in law, Evelyn calls her out on the issue of Charlie's staying with Charlie in earshot. Gwendolyn has a fearful look in her eye when she glimpses Charlie and rather than spend the night in the house she heads for a motel. Her fate is one of the few we actually see happen. Or do we?India continues to feel that something isn't quite right with her uncle Charlie. Nor is she happy with the way her mother seems to be fawning over him. Is it jealousy or is it a touch of caution she feels, a bit of intuition that makes her think that something just isn't quite right.India also has problems not centered around home. In school she is tormented by the class bully for her unusual appearance and high IQ. Eventually a confrontation ensues between them where she is saved by another classmate. A love interest? Possibly. Then again there is more there than is seen on screen.The movie is filled with twists and turns leading the viewer down one path and then veering off into another. Is Charlie really India's uncle or is he really a man whose only interest is her mother? Why does Charlie stare at India so intently? What really happened to the people that seem to disappear all around India? The answers to these question and more are answered before the end of the film and answered in such a way as to surprise even the most jaded viewer.One thing you should know going in is that this film is not normal in any sense of the word. Characters seem like nothing you would find in real life yet they fit well in this story. Performances are not done in a standard method here but seem more like caricatures of characters instead. Speech and body language are done not as we would expect people to behave but instead to move the story forward. This may be in part because of the language difficulties found for director Chan-wook Park in his first time doing an English speaking film. Fans of this director won't be disappointed by what he offers here.STOKER might not be the movie that most everyone will think of when looking through what is available on the racks or in the Redbox. But if you're willing to step out of your comfort zone, if you're willing to try something new, then this would be the movie to do that with. It also might be enough to get you interested in the other films of Chan-wook Park. While it's far from normal, it is interesting at all turns.",3,ODD BUT IN A GOOD WAY,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,4513,"['guess', 'may', 'decipher', 'what', 'going', 'new', 'DVD', 'release', 'STOKER', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'most', 'will', 'not', 'honest', 'truth', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'rare', 'film', 'will', 'offer', 'moments', 'sheer', 'unease', 'film', 'when', 'so', 'effectively', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'movie', 'other', 'quite', 'original.Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'India', 'Stoker', 'young', 'woman', 'father', 'just', 'died', 'tragic', 'accident', 'Early', 'film', 'voice', 'scenes', 'past', 'know', 'India', 'nothing', 'not', 'unusual', 'birthday', 'year', 'same', 'gift', 'father', 'new', 'pair', 'shoes', 'replace', 'old', 'ones', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'now', 'funeral', 'get', 'better', 'glimpse', 'rest', 'family', 'India', 'mother', 'Evelyn', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'wife', 'who', 'bit', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'distraught', 'widow', 'walking', 'life', 'not', 'caring', 'about', 'much', 'distance', 'mother', 'daughter', 'up', 'film', 'India', 'was', 'definitely', 'daddy', 'daughter', 'mom', 'was', 'just', 'someone', 'who', 'think', 'more', 'herself', 'India.At', 'funeral', 'India', 'uncle', 'Charlie', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'Charlie', 'was', 'rarely', 'seen', 'heard', 'fact', 'India', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'aware', 'existed', 'mother', 'take', 'well', 'up', 'staying', 'house', 'help', 'out', 'point', 'towards', 'usual', 'relationship', 'widow', 'missing', 'brother', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'hints', 'are', 'never', 'so', 'certain', 'here', 'more', 'going', 'realize.The', 'first', 'odd', 'thing', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'McGarrick', 'housekeeper', 'suddenly', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'got', 'along', 'fine', 'India', 'who', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'having', 'words', 'Charlie', 'viewers', 'assume', 'what', 'possibly', 'happened', 'proof', 'scene', 'what', 'happened', 'could', 'have', 'happened.Then', 'India', 'grandmother', 'Gwendolyn', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'reservations', 'Charlie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'share', 'out', 'loud', 'When', 'discuss', 'daughter', 'law', 'Evelyn', 'out', 'issue', 'Charlie', 'staying', 'Charlie', 'earshot', 'Gwendolyn', 'fearful', 'look', 'eye', 'when', 'Charlie', 'rather', 'spend', 'night', 'house', 'motel', 'fate', 'one', 'few', 'actually', 'see', 'happen', 'do', 'India', 'feel', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'uncle', 'Charlie', 'happy', 'way', 'mother', 'be', 'fawning', 'jealousy', 'touch', 'caution', 'bit', 'intuition', 'think', 'something', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right.India', 'also', 'problems', 'not', 'centered', 'home', 'school', 'tormented', 'class', 'bully', 'unusual', 'appearance', 'high', 'IQ', 'Eventually', 'confrontation', 'where', 'saved', 'classmate', 'love', 'interest', 'Possibly', 'Then', 'again', 'more', 'there', 'seen', 'screen.The', 'movie', 'filled', 'twists', 'leading', 'viewer', 'down', 'one', 'path', 'then', 'veering', 'off', 'Charlie', 'really', 'India', 'uncle', 'really', 'man', 'only', 'interest', 'mother', 'Why', 'Charlie', 'stare', 'India', 'so', 'intently', 'What', 'really', 'happened', 'people', 'seem', 'disappear', 'India', 'answers', 'question', 'more', 'are', 'answered', 'end', 'film', 'answered', 'such', 'way', 'surprise', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'viewer.One', 'thing', 'should', 'know', 'going', 'film', 'not', 'normal', 'sense', 'word', 'Characters', 'seem', 'nothing', 'would', 'find', 'real', 'life', 'yet', 'fit', 'well', 'story', 'Performances', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'standard', 'method', 'here', 'seem', 'more', 'like', 'caricatures', 'characters', 'instead', 'Speech', 'body', 'language', 'are', 'done', 'not', 'would', 'expect', 'people', 'behave', 'instead', 'move', 'story', 'forward', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'language', 'difficulties', 'found', 'director', 'Chan-wook', 'Park', 'first', 'time', 'doing', 'English', 'speaking', 'film', 'Fans', 'director', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'what', 'here.STOKER', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'movie', 'most', 'everyone', 'will', 'think', 'when', 'looking', 'what', 'available', 'racks', 'Redbox', ""'re"", 'willing', 'step', 'comfort', 'zone', ""'re"", 'willing', 'try', 'something', 'new', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'do', 'also', 'might', 'be', 'enough', 'get', 'interested', 'other', 'films', 'Chan-wook', 'Park', 'far', 'normal', 'interesting', 'turns']",Stoker

1637980,A205C7VCSDVARI,B00BSN0VZ2,Meatwad,"[2, 5]","Director: Park Chan Wook.Writer: Wentworth Miller.Staring: Mia Wasikowska, Matthew Goode, Nicole Kidman, Dermot Mulroney, Phyllis Somerville, Jacki Weaver, Lucas Till, Alden Ehrenreich and Ralph Brown.Running Time: 99 minutes.Rating: Rated R for Disturbing Violent and Sexual Content.There are movies out there that almost feel like we should embrace a darker side to ourselves. Movies that cause whatever malicious feelings we have for our fellow man to come rising right up, as we smile with devilish glee over man's inhumanity to man. Usually, horror films do this, as we see their usually idiotic protagonists sent to their doom in the most horrible of ways. Or maybe something opposite, like with the character of Hannibal Lecter, who gets away with all of his killings with class and style.In the event if you are wondering that Stoker is one of these films, I can safely say yes, Stoker is definitely that kind of film, namely the ladder. I can also say its easily one of the my personal favorites of this year, even with its slight issues, a film that is more than worthy of any time you may have to spend with it. Its many themes of childhood, growing up, maturity and family are so lovingly twisted around to the point that things we view as beauty turn to something we wish to distance ourselves as far as possible. It is very much the kind of film that likes to get under your skin.India Stoker and her mother (Mia Wasikowska and Nicole Kidman, respectively) are mourning over the death of the father in the family, Richard Stoker (Dermot Mulroney). However, during their time grief, Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode) comes right into the picture to help them out. He slips his way into the trust of the mother but India has untrustworthy feelings for Charlie. She knows he's up to something but something about Charlie's attitude starts rubbing off her and it all goes a in a surreal and icky direction from there.I must admit I am a bit of a Park Chan Wook fanboy here. His 2003 film Oldboy is what I consider to be the best film I've ever seen, from its beautiful camera work, astonishing performances and incredible emotional depth. Wook's style of filmmaking is something that gets under your skin. The way he does sex and violence can bounce between being arousing and strangely enjoyable to grotesque and extremely difficult to watch. Stoker continues this trend but it somewhat plays with it. You don't feel as strongly about one as the other. It reaches an unusual balance of sorts. It also feels a little restrained in comparison to his other works. The film can get really uncomfortable when it wants to be, though, like a scene involving a shower and masturbation.Usually, Mr. Wook has a hand in the screenplays he directs, but instead, the writing duties go to actor Wentworth Miller of Prison Break fame. The screenplay by him, caught wind in Hollywood in 2010 and became a part of the ""Hollywood Blacklist"", a list of the most popular unproduced screenplays. I could see how the script would click with Mr. Wook, however, as it chuck full of the things he likes to examine and his sick fun with.A thing to note about Stoker is that is is a very symbolism heavy film, ala Darren Aronofsky or David Lynch. Lots of little things could mean something else entirely. A perfect example would be a spider that we see a lot in the film. Every time it shows up, it is always see crawling over India's legs, starting with the feet, then the legs, then the thigh, etc. One way I see is that it is a sign of Uncle Charlie's influence on India on much he's corrupting her. Or how India's shoes are put in prime focus, with multiple instances of seeing all of the shoes she's had over the years as she's become older.Wook's visual style stands tall here as well, with many subdued colors bouncing between every frame. Characters in the film can end up having eerily normal outfits, almost giving off the feel that the air of civility that they sport could snap at any moment. The camera work is also equally excellent, namely a scene when India is on a roundabout and spinning while the camera is just in perfect sync with her movements.On the performance side, the three leads are all equally good. Mia Wasikowska brings a very quiet and yet effecting performance as the detached India, as she tries to piece together what her life will go from here and Charlie's intetions. Nicole Kidman offers some good, if slightly minimal work here. She isn't, for my money at least, in the movie as much as I would like but she leaves an impression, especially a venomous rant she gives off near the end of film. Matthew Goode steals the show, however, as the very unnerving Uncle Charlie. Despite his soft-spoken tone and charm, Goode's performance oozes with the feeling of a man who kill you in a millisecond.  Every scene he appears in is enough to put you on edge.Musically, the film is pretty wonderful in this department. The film was supposed to have heavyweight Phillip Glass (Koyaanisqatsi, The Truman Show, The Hours) but instead got the wonderfully experimental Clint Mansell (Requiem For A Dream, Moon, Black Swan). Nicely enough, we actually get to hear some of Glass's work in the film, in the form of a lovely duet piano duet between India and Charlie but Mansell, as always, provides a very nice score that fits incredibly well with the tone of the film. There's also a third artist, Emily Wells, who provides the end credits song, which offers a nice cap off to the film's end. It's a song that pretty well with the end of the picture.The film does have its problems, but not with the script in any manner or direction. It mainly lies in how it was put together. I've read reports that film had twenty minutes cut out and while I still have massive enjoyment from what I watched, I wish we could have seen that longer cut. The main parts where the film has its pacing issues are, funnily enough, are at the beginning and end. The beginning is a bit jumpy with the flow of events while the end takes is certainly in no haste to deal with tension at hand.There's also just the fact Stoker will not be a film for everyone. Around the time the film was being screened at the Sundance Film Festival, the response was almost universally positive. But when it came for the public response, it was much more mixed. Rotten Tomatoes currently has the film at an 67%, which is certainly positive but definitely shows off the fact that it isn't for everyone. The increasingly violent and sexual content, the uneasy feel of everything, the pacing and some of the actors performances will either be seen as wonderfully atmospheric or a bunch slow, pretentious drivel.Is Stoker Park Chan Wook's new masterpiece? Hell no. Nothing will ever top Oldboy in my eyes, regardless of how good or who's in it. That was just the pinnacle of his career right there, but Stoker still serves as a nice addition to his body of work and even a good jumping off point if you want to see if you like his filmmaking style. Its performances, story, visuals and, just quite frankly, balls it has elevate it above most of what comes out in American markets these days.",5,Death in the Family,1371686400,"06 20,

Well, I would say that is kinda weird, what would the reason for that be?  Throughout the films running time you slowly get to see more and more of how creepy and crazy this Uncle character is.

1637986,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00BSN0VZ2,M. Oleson,"[5, 5]","I'm pretty sure Alfred Hitchcock* would love this creepy film about the survivors of a family headed by Richard Stoker (Dermot Mulroney in flashback scenes) recently killed in a car crash.  His surviving wife, alcoholic Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) and their withdrawn teenage daughter India (Mia Wasikowska) are soon joined by a mysterious, and heretofore unknown, brother (Matthew Goode).  Brother Charlie's arrival is a shock to everyone including the family's long time housekeeper (Phyllis Somerville) and the brothers' aunt (Jacki Weaver).Charlie's behavior is pleasant, proper and formal but at the same time, the way the guy focuses on people and things will give you the heebie jeebies.  He reminds me of Norman Bates.  Charlie is 9 years younger than his brother and no one has ever talked about him.  In a couple scenes, Charlie who sees himself as a pretty good cook, presents dinner to India and Evie but doesn't eat himself.  What is this guy, a vampire?  (I wonder if the title suggests a reference to Bram Stoker)Korean director Chan-wook Park has a good handle on this film, given that the premise is a bit ridiculous.  It has some extreme sexual elements to it, but never goes too far...well except for Charlie's longing looks at his niece.  Charlie originally uses his considerable charms on Evie which is disturbing enough, but it is clear his primary focus is elsewhere and those who get in his way will have a price to pay.  Goode is very good in this role.Equally noteworthy is Wasikowska who classmates call ""Stroker"" for no reason other than to torment her.  She stays within herself and is terribly suspicious of Charlie, yet fights an urge of attraction.  Her nature is perhaps hinted at early in the movie when a spider shows up on her leg.  The movie is great to look at with some beautiful sets.  Park has made a stylistic, if not perfect thriller.*Check out Hitchcock's excellent ""Shadow of a Doubt""  for a similar themed film about another Uncle Charlie.  Also for Hitchcock fans, see if you can spot the McGuffin(s).Another bonus is the excellent Blu ray transfer.  It has the usual 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The movie was originally shot using 35mm film and the transfer to Blu ray is flawless.  Wonderful clarity.  Check out the detail of the spider crawling on the floor and onto India's leg.  Great skin tones.  The audio component is likewise exemplary.  Using a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, there are numerous subtleties that eek out of the speakers.  A ticking metronome, insects, rain, hooting owls are highlighted.  There are a couple scenes where India and Charlie play the piano.  Excellent as is the whole film score.

I'm not a big tech guy, but you don't have to be to appreciate the sound in this. Another great score from Clint Mansell, who I've come to think of as the best in the business.

As the movie opens, we see that India's dad just passed away in a car accident and at the funeral India and her mom Evelyn (played by Nicole Kidman) in mourning. India then notices that there is a man watching the entire scene from afar. It turns out to be Charlie (played by Matthew Goode), the younger brother of the deceased dad who has never been around in their lives. Charlie moves in with Indian and Evelyn to help them mourning, and Evelyn seems to be much charmed by his presence. India not so much, even though Charlie give her a lot of attention. A few days later Gwendolyn (played by Jacki Weaver), a great-aunt of India, comes for a visit, to the apparent annoyance of Charlie and Evelyn, and Gwendolyn's stay is short. At that point we are about 40 min. into the movie. What is all going on here? What really happened when India's dad passed away? Will Charlie and Evelyn become lovers? What about India in all this? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: this movie is the first English-language movie directed by famed South Korean director Park Chan-wook, and he brings a very visual movie with ""Stoker"". The movie takes quite a while to build up, as I really was wondering which direction this was going to take, but the last 30 min. or so, when all is revealed, are worth the wait. In that sense, the movie is a slowburner that eventually will win you over. Mia Wasikowska's performance is the key to holding the movie together. I found Nicole Kidman's performance rather detached, although obviously she is playing the material that was given to her. Jacki Weaver's screen time is sadly very short. But in all, I thought this movie was not nearly as bad as some of the movie critics would've let me to believe.That said, ""Stoker"" was released on just one screen in Greater Cincinnati this weekend, and despite that, when I saw it tonight (a Saturday evening), the attendance was terrible (8 people, including myself). That tells me this movie will not play long, and if you want to see this in a theatre, you'd better jump on in when you can.

1638005,AWOROFNE3S4W3,B00BSN0VZ2,Phillip Frangules,"[0, 1]","Many foreign filmmakers have made the move from their native country to America, and more often than not their style is either lost in the translation to Hollywood. As such, one of the best things I can say about Park Chan-wook's ""Stoker"" is that it *feels* like a Park Chan-wook film. This is perhaps to the film's detriment; the film played in a limited release and was only seen by a few people. Still, I have to commend Park for not sacrificing his art for the sake of commercial success. In the end, 'Stoker' is a film that can stand side by side with Park's other work and not feel out of place.'Stoker' is effectively a dark coming of age story revolving around a young girl named India and her mysterious uncle Charlie who moves in with her mother after her father dies. The script, which is written by Prison Break's Wentworth Miller, has been cited as critics as being one of the weaker aspects of the film. In my opinion, while it's not as ""meaty"" as Park's other films it's still above  other films of its kind. There's a strong blend of dark humor and suspense and I was genuinely surprised by some of the twists and turns. Needless to say, I'm looking forward to what he comes up with next.Mia Wasikowska and Matthew Goode both great performances as India and Charlie. Wasikowska is vulnerable, sympathetic while also downright creepy at times and Goode in particular oozes sinister charisma. Nicole Kidman is also effective but I feel that her character is underutilized aside from a brief monologue about parenting that she gives near the end.Directing-wise, I think Park has done some of his best work in this film. His style here is almost operatic and dreamlike and many of the shots are breathtaking.How's the disc itself? Well the picture is flawless as is the sound (as far as I can tell with my limited sound system). I wish I could say something more unique than 'it replicates the theatrical experience perfectly"" but there's not much else to say. From a visual standpoint at least this is the best Park Chan-wook has ever looked on Blu-ray.Features-wise, I was a bit disappointed at the lack of a commentary from either Park (who usually does at least one) or Miller (who doesn't appear at all during the features but is only mentioned). Still, we get close to an hour of behind the scenes special features and what we have is pretty neat. There's a lot of discussion of Park as a filmmaker and the experience of working with him (he doesn't speak English and needed an interpreter on set). What stuck out to me was the level of input that Park had on the story itself; much of the film's symbolism and imagery came directly from him. Rounding it up are some deleted scenes and footage from the Korean premiere.The film benefits from a strong script, great performances from its cast and Park Chan-wook's unique visual style. If you're a fan of Park's earlier output you won't be disappointed.On a final note, I think it's interesting that so many people found 'Stoker' to be ""upsetting"" or ""disturbing"" given how tame it is compared to Park's Korean filmography. I guess in that regards this film works as a litmus test: if you can't handle this, stay far, far away from Oldboy.",5,A strong American debut for Park,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,3205,"['Many', 'foreign', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'made', 'move', 'native', 'country', 'America', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'style', 'lost', 'translation', 'Hollywood', 'such', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'can', 'say', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', 'Stoker', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', 'film', 'perhaps', 'film', 'detriment', 'film', 'played', 'limited', 'release', 'was', 'only', 'seen', 'few', 'people', 'Still', 'have', 'commend', 'Park', 'not', 'sacrificing', 'art', 'sake', 'commercial', 'success', 'end', ""'Stoker"", 'film', 'can', 'stand', 'side', 'side', 'Park', 'other', 'work', 'not', 'feel', 'place', ""'Stoker"", 'effectively', 'dark', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'revolving', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'India', 'mysterious', 'uncle', 'Charlie', 'who', 'mother', 'father', 'dies', 'script', 'written', 'Prison', 'Break', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'been', 'cited', 'critics', 'being', 'one', 'weaker', 'aspects', 'film', 'opinion', 'not', 'meaty', 'Park', 'other', 'films', 'still', 'other', 'films', 'kind', 'strong', 'blend', 'dark', 'humor', 'suspense', 'was', 'genuinely', 'surprised', 'twists', 'turns', 'Needless', 'say', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'what', 'up', 'next.Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'great', 'performances', 'India', 'Charlie', 'Wasikowska', 'vulnerable', 'sympathetic', 'also', 'downright', 'creepy', 'times', 'Goode', 'particular', 'oozes', 'sinister', 'charisma', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'also', 'effective', 'feel', 'character', 'underutilized', 'aside', 'brief', 'monologue', 'parenting', 'end.Directing-wise', 'think', 'Park', 'done', 'best', 'work', 'film', 'style', 'here', 'almost', 'operatic', 'dreamlike', 'many', 'shots', 'are', 'breathtaking.How', 'disc', 'Well', 'picture', 'flawless', 'sound', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'limited', 'sound', 'system', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'something', 'more', 'unique', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'perfectly', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'say', 'visual', 'standpoint', 'least', 'best', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', 'ever', 'looked', 'Blu-ray.Features-wise', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'commentary', 'Park', 'who', 'usually', 'least', 'one', 'Miller', 'who', ""n't"", 'appear', 'features', 'only', 'mentioned', 'Still', 'get', 'close', 'hour', 'scenes', 'special', 'features', 'what', 'have', 'pretty', 'neat', 'lot', 'discussion', 'Park', 'filmmaker', 'experience', 'working', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'needed', 'interpreter', 'set', 'What', 'stuck', 'out', 'was', 'level', 'input', 'Park', 'had', 'story', 'much', 'film', 'symbolism', 'imagery', 'came', 'directly', 'Rounding', 'up', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'footage', 'Korean', 'premiere.The', 'film', 'benefits', 'strong', 'script', 'great', 'performances', 'cast', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', 'unique', 'visual', 'style', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Park', 'earlier', 'output', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.On', 'final', 'note', 'think', 'interesting', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'found', ""'Stoker"", 'be', 'upsetting', 'disturbing', 'given', 'how', 'tame', 'compared', 'Park', 'Korean', 'filmography', 'guess', 'regards', 'film', 'litmus', 'test', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'stay', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'Oldboy']",Stoker

India (Mia Wasikowska) is a troubled 18-year-old whose attractive, sports-car-driving uncle (Matthew Goode) moves in with her and her mother (Nicole Kidman) upon the death of her beloved father. And before you know it, people are hanging around in corners whispering confidentially, bodies are dropping like flies, mama and her deceased husband's kid brother are making googly eyes at one another , and India is beginning to develop some awfully inappropriate feelings for her dear not-so-old Uncle Charlie. On top of all that, India is learning that she may have some hitherto undiscovered paranormal ability that allows her to ""see what other people can`t see, hear what other people can`t hear.""Though the movie establishes an effective mood and atmosphere throughout, the screenplay by Wentworth Miller is cryptic almost to the point of incoherence, as if the writers couldn't establish their coolness credentials and ""hipness"" bona fides if they didn't oversell their case. And oversell it they do, as the audience tries its damnedest to make some sort of sense out of what on earth is going on.

That spider crawling up India's leg - is she attracting it, or is it infecting her? In either case, it's easy to make the equation with evil. In the same way, the nature program that plays on the TV as backdrop to some of the most malevolent action, is about an eagle's slow, intent circling of its prey.Other symbolic resonances are less obvious, their full significance likely to be caught only the second or third time through. Those sharpened pencils lined up in their case - the victims lying in their various improvised coffins. Then there's each year's gift of a new pair of schoolgirl shoes given to India - until her 18th birthday and the gift of a different kind of shoe.I first thought the film was a little too consistently, self-consciously fraught with portent. But before long, I was hypnotized into it, transfixed by the gleaming, intense cobra eyes of the characters.The main problem with the movie is it title.

Never close to her mother Evelyn (Nichole Kidman) but adored by her father, India's world is turned further upside down by the arrival of her father's brother, Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), a handsome and charismatic guy, recently back from living abroad, who hasn't seen India since she was a baby.Without giving anything away, it becomes very clear - very quickly - that something is not quite right about Uncle Charlie; that his calm, quiet, smiling exterior may hold something much, much darker.  And as India tries to peel away the layers of her uncle, what is revealed are things that repulse ... but also, bizarrely, fascinate.To say more would be giving away too much, but I can say I loved the film; it's smart, intense, and beautifully written.  Mia Wasikowska proves she's one of the best actors of her generation working today, and Nicole Kidman does her usual excellent job, this time playing a broken bird of a woman who may be too far gone to be fixed.  But Matthew Goode, always a favorite of mine, shines here as the deceptively kind Uncle Charlie, and his scenes with Wasikowska particularly play like twisted works of art.I guess I can see, a bit, why some reviewers call this an updating of Hitchcock's 'Shadow of a Doubt' (one of my all-time favorite of Hitchcock's films, and one EVERYONE should see); I read somewhere that the name of Uncle Charlie's character in this film was an homage to Joseph Cotten's ""Uncle Charlie"" in the Hitchcock classic, and God knows the film's tone and mood are very Hitchcockian.

It's actually quite a feat that director Park Chan-wook is able to achieve, with three individuals so shrouded in mystery but make us not really wonder what went down so long ago.The movie is undeniably made well though. The score by Carter Burwell (of Black Swan) contributes to the atmosphere, as does the excellent sound design, heightening the cracks of an egg, the snip of scissors, and other disconcerning noises.The flow also keeps the movie watchable, if not wholly engaging; it was easy to sit back and watch events unfold, but I wasn't really concerned one way or the other of how things went down - UNTIL a jolting revelation came about an hour into the movie. Suddenly the pace didn't seem quite so plodding when this element added an unsettling intensity to the story.-consistently creepy atmosphere.From there, though, the movie kind of fell apart; without providing spoilers, the end plot point just didn't fit with the logic of the rest of the story.

Mia Wasikowska's previously hinted at stiffness/awkwardness are spotlighted here by the horrible situations the script and director have put her in.

While some of you may be impressed with the beautiful but often unsettling images and the eerie performance from the star Mia Wasikowska, others will scratch their heads, feeling that this ""coming-of-age"" thriller is ridiculous and pretentious.Mia Wasikowska is India Stoker, a soon-to-be eighteen-year-old girl, whose father died in a bizarre accident.

I wasn't bored. The credit goes to the director whose penchant for describing humanity in a warped and twisted manner is still intact here. The cast also should be praised for creating creepy characters with some compelling (and somewhat over-the-top) acting.At the same time, however, the secluded world of ""Stoker"" looks distant, as if recording some events that are happening on another planet. This is partly because Chan-wook Park is not interested in typical human behavior, but another reason is, I suspect, that the director is no Pedro Almod&oacute;var or Hitchcock, directors with better storytelling skills, who can fill seemingly unrealistic stories with thrills and insights.Or maybe that distantness is the point.

Just as in ""Jane Eyre"", Wasikowska delivers an ethereal, otherworldly performance, and perhaps this has as much to do with her luminous beauty as with her skills as an actor. The story moves slowly, but this deliberate pacing is apt considering all that the viewer needs to take in in order to put the various pieces of the puzzle together before the shocking climax and the final scene.Wasikowska plays India Stoker, a high school student who is mourning the recent death of her beloved father, Richard (Dermot Mulroney). India is distant from her mother, Evelyn (Nicole Kidman), and is repulsed by physical touch. When her father's estranged brother, Charles (Matthew Goode) shows up, India's reaction to him is almost visceral. She is troubled by his sudden appearance and questions his motives, and is appalled at the intimate manner in which her mother behaves towards Charlie. It soon becomes apparent however that Charles's real interest lies in his niece, but what drives this interest? Is it mere sex, the anticipation of seduction, or is there much more to it?The story has many layers to it, and what appears on the surface to be a Lolita-esque film turns out to be so much more darker and chilling. The discerning viewer will benefit from multiple viewings, as things that seemed disconnected turn out to be irrevocably woven together into one seamless story. Like an intricate spider's web, this story captivated me and held me in its thrall. Matthew Goode delivers a consummate performance as the debonair uncle whose eyes speak volumes when meeting India's wide, questioning eyes. He stalks India like a predator stalks a prey, but his motivations remain unclear until about halfway through the story, and when the big reveal comes, it is like a punch to the gut. Wasikowska's India metamorphoses from a virginal, quiet beauty into something entirely different, and this transformation is chilling to witness, especially when it becomes clear what she really is.Creepy, beautiful, haunting, and chilling, Stoker is a cinematic gem that will appeal to those who favor a more cerebral type of horror film.",5,"Beautifully-filmed, multilayered, and chilling coming-of-age drama",1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,2241,"['loved', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'performance', 'inJane', 'Eyreand', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'Stoker', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'check', 'out', 'Just', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Wasikowska', 'ethereal', 'otherworldly', 'performance', 'perhaps', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'luminous', 'beauty', 'skills', 'actor', 'story', 'slowly', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'apt', 'considering', 'viewer', 'take', 'order', 'put', 'various', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'together', 'shocking', 'climax', 'final', 'scene.Wasikowska', 'plays', 'India', 'Stoker', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'mourning', 'recent', 'death', 'beloved', 'father', 'Richard', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'India', 'distant', 'mother', 'Evelyn', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'repulsed', 'physical', 'touch', 'When', 'father', 'estranged', 'brother', 'Charles', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'up', 'India', 'reaction', 'almost', 'visceral', 'troubled', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'questions', 'motives', 'appalled', 'intimate', 'manner', 'mother', 'towards', 'Charlie', 'soon', 'apparent', 'however', 'Charles', 'real', 'interest', 'niece', 'what', 'interest', 'mere', 'sex', 'anticipation', 'seduction', 'there', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'many', 'layers', 'what', 'surface', 'be', 'Lolita-esque', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'darker', 'chilling', 'discerning', 'viewer', 'will', 'benefit', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'things', 'seemed', 'disconnected', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'irrevocably', 'woven', 'together', 'one', 'seamless', 'story', 'intricate', 'spider', 'web', 'story', 'captivated', 'held', 'thrall', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'consummate', 'performance', 'debonair', 'uncle', 'eyes', 'speak', 'volumes', 'when', 'meeting', 'India', 'wide', 'questioning', 'eyes', 'India', 'predator', 'prey', 'motivations', 'remain', 'unclear', 'halfway', 'story', 'when', 'big', 'reveal', 'punch', 'gut', 'Wasikowska', 'India', 'virginal', 'quiet', 'beauty', 'something', 'entirely', 'different', 'transformation', 'chilling', 'witness', 'especially', 'when', 'clear', 'what', 'really', 'is.Creepy', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'chilling', 'Stoker', 'cinematic', 'gem', 'will', 'appeal', 'who', 'favor', 'more', 'cerebral', 'type', 'horror', 'film']",Stoker
