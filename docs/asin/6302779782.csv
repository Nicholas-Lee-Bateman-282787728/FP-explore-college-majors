I certainly wasn't expecting that.  The premise of a woman with split personalities doesn't usually scream `flat' and yet, I was always waiting for something to grip me, to take me somewhere thrilling and exciting and yet all I got was this monotone feeling that permeated the entire picture.Joanne Woodward won an Oscar for her portrayal of Eve White who is a mild mannered housewife who suffers from blackouts, when her other self, Eve Black, comes out to play.  Eve Black is a sexy and more provocative woman.  But when Eve goes to therapy her therapist discovers a third self, Jane, who is sensible and intelligent and nothing like either Eve.  Woodward does a fine job in the title role, but the film does her an overall disservice.  The film's lack of shading leads to a less dynamic performance, and it really could have used some more dimensions.That said, she flips between personas rather effortlessly, and she certainly stands out amidst the coldness of the rest of the film's elements, including her co-stars who never seem to pull themselves out of the stilted direction of the film.This is based or should I say inspired of true events, but it is scaled down drastically (this real Eve, Chris Costner Sizemore, actually suffered from nearly twenty personalities) and so it feels somewhat smaller, too introverted.  This isn't to suggest that it needed to be loud and abrasive, for subtle can often speak so much louder, but there is a dull varnish that washes over this film in a way that makes it feel less important or less impactful than it should have been.",2,The three shrugs of a dissatisfied viewer...,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,1706,"['apparently', 'three', 'shrugs', 'resulted', 'two', 'stars.As', 'film', 'something', 'almost', 'flat', 'Three', 'Faces', 'Eve', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'premise', 'woman', 'split', 'personalities', ""n't"", 'usually', 'scream', 'flat', 'yet', 'was', 'always', 'waiting', 'something', 'grip', 'take', 'somewhere', 'thrilling', 'exciting', 'yet', 'got', 'was', 'monotone', 'feeling', 'permeated', 'entire', 'picture.Joanne', 'Woodward', 'won', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Eve', 'White', 'who', 'mild', 'mannered', 'housewife', 'who', 'blackouts', 'when', 'other', 'self', 'Eve', 'Black', 'out', 'play', 'Eve', 'Black', 'sexy', 'more', 'provocative', 'woman', 'when', 'Eve', 'therapy', 'therapist', 'third', 'self', 'Jane', 'who', 'sensible', 'intelligent', 'nothing', 'Eve', 'Woodward', 'fine', 'job', 'title', 'role', 'film', 'overall', 'disservice', 'film', 'lack', 'shading', 'leads', 'less', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'dimensions.That', 'said', 'personas', 'rather', 'effortlessly', 'certainly', 'out', 'coldness', 'rest', 'film', 'elements', 'including', 'co-stars', 'who', 'never', 'seem', 'pull', 'stilted', 'direction', 'film.This', 'based', 'should', 'say', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'scaled', 'down', 'drastically', 'real', 'Eve', 'Chris', 'Costner', 'Sizemore', 'actually', 'suffered', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'personalities', 'somewhat', 'smaller', 'too', 'introverted', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'needed', 'be', 'loud', 'abrasive', 'subtle', 'can', 'often', 'speak', 'so', 'much', 'louder', 'dull', 'varnish', 'film', 'way', 'feel', 'less', 'important', 'less', 'impactful', 'should', 'have', 'been']",N/A

Here we have a film viewed as a case hisdtory and that is the approach. The very intelligent commentator does mention psychiatry was viewed negatively by americans prewar,commonly known as head shrinkers and have a very narrow basis for diagnosing illness as compared to psychology and other fields. The movie was proposed to marilyn monroe and judy garland who both had problems of some sort in their personal lives,some say quite serios but nothing came of it. Multiple personality,or more tecchnically disassociated selves,and still under revision and trying to be understood in dsm 5,happens more frequently supposedly in north america. In the opening scene we have a marriage problem,and the wife ends up abusing the child and a psychiatrist is sought...rather than jumping to the conclusion of schizophrenia,the patient is too insightful and aware for that label to be used,there is meely conjecture. That is why the patient is seen to have different selves the at home housewife eve, and the partyingclubber not associated with each other,and the psychiatrist asks about her happiness,her marriage relationships,discordant views of the world. The movie tends to resolve itself in this area and there are many scenes in mental wards (notice the names used,biblical,eve and the reformer luther) and at the end the film ends in a scene undera house whe she searches for a ball in a claustrophobic atmosphere of space limitations where fears and environmental changes produce childlike fears of kissing a dead person(death scene from a jungian adult perspective)and eventually the scene is resolved and she experiences catharsis and the divergent selves disappear and she has one self. Some food for thought at the beginning of film she is unhappily married and has many symtoms and split selves....at end happy adult relationship,overjoyed,and very amicable relationship with child,the key for thiseve,very freudian,is adult fulfillment which makes her whole,and thats the case history. That's how you tie it up...psychiatrists will not like these kinds of views,which the commentary details,and the film was not popular the soap opera like peyton place was the commentary shows,but gained some popularity when released on tv years later,that's when i saw it,and i should emphasize freudian ideas deal with ill men and woman,not normal functioning ones and is reality centered or attempts to be and multifaceted.",5,Great movie about problem personalities,1337644800,"05 22, 2012",2012,2551,"['movie', 'such', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'viewed', 'presenting', 'males', 'females', 'typically', 'ill', 'read', 'manual', 'can', 'be', 'ill', 'Here', 'have', 'film', 'viewed', 'case', 'hisdtory', 'approach', 'very', 'intelligent', 'commentator', 'mention', 'psychiatry', 'was', 'viewed', 'negatively', 'americans', 'prewar', 'commonly', 'known', 'head', 'shrinkers', 'have', 'very', 'narrow', 'basis', 'diagnosing', 'illness', 'compared', 'psychology', 'other', 'fields', 'movie', 'was', 'proposed', 'marilyn', 'monroe', 'judy', 'garland', 'who', 'had', 'problems', 'sort', 'personal', 'lives', 'say', 'quite', 'serios', 'nothing', 'came', 'Multiple', 'personality', 'more', 'tecchnically', 'disassociated', 'selves', 'still', 'revision', 'trying', 'be', 'understood', 'dsm', '5', 'more', 'frequently', 'supposedly', 'north', 'america', 'opening', 'scene', 'have', 'marriage', 'problem', 'wife', 'up', 'abusing', 'child', 'psychiatrist', 'sought', 'rather', 'jumping', 'conclusion', 'schizophrenia', 'patient', 'too', 'insightful', 'aware', 'label', 'be', 'used', 'meely', 'conjecture', 'why', 'patient', 'seen', 'have', 'different', 'selves', 'home', 'housewife', 'eve', 'partyingclubber', 'not', 'associated', 'other', 'psychiatrist', 'happiness', 'marriage', 'relationships', 'discordant', 'views', 'world', 'movie', 'resolve', 'area', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'mental', 'wards', 'names', 'used', 'biblical', 'eve', 'reformer', 'luther', 'end', 'film', 'scene', 'undera', 'house', 'ball', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'space', 'limitations', 'where', 'fears', 'environmental', 'changes', 'produce', 'childlike', 'fears', 'kissing', 'dead', 'person', 'death', 'scene', 'jungian', 'adult', 'perspective', 'eventually', 'scene', 'resolved', 'catharsis', 'divergent', 'disappear', 'one', 'self', 'food', 'thought', 'beginning', 'film', 'unhappily', 'married', 'many', 'symtoms', 'split', 'selves', '.at', 'end', 'happy', 'adult', 'relationship', 'overjoyed', 'very', 'amicable', 'relationship', 'child', 'key', 'thiseve', 'very', 'freudian', 'adult', 'fulfillment', 'whole', 'case', 'history', 'how', 'tie', 'up', 'psychiatrists', 'will', 'not', 'kinds', 'views', 'commentary', 'details', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'popular', 'soap', 'opera', 'peyton', 'place', 'was', 'commentary', 'shows', 'gained', 'popularity', 'when', 'released', 'tv', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'i', 'saw', 'i', 'should', 'emphasize', 'freudian', 'ideas', 'deal', 'ill', 'men', 'woman', 'not', 'normal', 'functioning', 'ones', 'reality', 'centered', 'attempts', 'be', 'multifaceted']",N/A

333495,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6302779782,Byron Kolln,"[16, 16]","THE THREE FACES OF EVE remains to this day a riveting and fascinating glimpse into the mind of a person afflicted with multiple personality disorder, with Joanne Woodward in her Academy Award-winning tour-de-force.The story concerns a meek young married woman called Eve White (Joanne Woodward) who begins to have regular consultations with Dr Luther (Lee J. Cobb) when she starts experiencing moments of blackout and amnesia, which are later discovered to be the manifestations of multiple personality disorder.  When Eve White passes out, the more-seductive and confident Eve Black emerges and wreaks her own kind of havoc.  Then there is the third personality, the well-grounded and assured Jane.  All three fight for the ultimate and permanent control of Eve White's body, but only one will win...Joanne Woodward's performance is truly phenomenal.  She deserved her Oscar win and then some.  Lee J. Cobb is fantastic as the patient Dr Luther with David Wayne as Eve White's bewildered husband.  This was based on the well-documented medical case of Chris Costner-Sizemore, a woman with several fragmented personalities who later successfully recovered from her illness.

333503,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6302779782,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","Chris Sizemore (b. 1927) experienced three traumas in a very short period during her early childhood.  These prompted the appearance of additional personalities--Sizemore says they had always been there, this was simply the occasion on which they made a physical manifestation.  Over the years the personalities came and went in waves, some dying away, others arising to take their place.  Ultimately, Sizemore found herself in the hands of two psychiatrists, Corbett H. Thigpen and Hevery M. Clerckley, who diagnosed her with multiple personality (known today as dissociative identity disorder.)  The doctors identified three distinct personalities, successfully treated Sizemore, and released her to live a happy and normal life.  They even wrote a book about the case and their success--and it was rapidly brought to the screen as THE THREE FACES OF EVE.The film was written, directed, and produced by Nunnally Johnson, and he had significant difficulty in casting the leading role, which was turned down by half a dozen actresses or more before Nunnually hit on Judy Garland.  Garland was fascinated and agreed to do the film, but was then sidelined by pre-existing concert commitments, leaving Nunnually to scramble.  Joanne Woodward, who had appeared in a number of television programs, was pretty much an unknown--but she tested well and once filming began people began to whisper about an Academy Award.It is fortunate that Woodward was so damned good in the part, because without her THE THREE FACES OF EVE would have probably sunk without a trace.  The film opens with a short lecture from Alistair Cooke, described as a ""distinguished commentator.""  As the film progresses, Cooke continues to make passing narrative comments just to make sure the audience knows what's going on, and the resulting tone is a bit strange, a sort of mix of documentary and drama.  Lee J. Cobb is acceptable as Eve's primary psychiatrist, but the rest of the cast doesn't really register, and the cinematic quality of the film isn't anything to write home about either; much is fictionalized and everything seems perfunctory.But the big noise about the film has always been Joanne Woodward's performance.  Working from film footage taken of Sizemore during treatment, and given access to all the psychiatrists' notes, Woodward plays the transformations as both smooth but rapid.  The new character appears and over the course of the next few moments gradually settles in, taking control of the body and space.  The similarities between the characters are often as startling as the differences, and it's no wonder that Woodward picked up an Academy Award for her efforts.The film ends with Eve cured--but now, of course, we know it wasn't really like that.  Sizemore was not cured, and the three personalities the doctors vanquished were merely replaced by three others, and then another set of three, and another set of three.  Sizemore began to feel antagonistic toward her doctors, who denied that she was still ill, and she felt shut out of conversations about her condition by the book and the movie.

The video quality is pristine and anyone viewing this Blu-ray would be hard pressed to find any print damage(lines, specks, torn frames, etc.) which means this great looking Blu-ray presentation probably came from the original camera negative. Once again, the restoration team at Fox deserves lots of credit for making ""Eve"" look brand new. They make the black and white cinematography by Stanley Cortez really stand out with grays, blacks and whites(no pun intended) especially sharp and well balanced throughout the film. That being said, the story may not appeal to everyone and may even appear dated considering what we now know about multiple personality disorder. The film really belongs to two people: Nunnally Johnson who wrote, produced and directed the film and Joanne Woodward in her Oscar winning performance(actually performances) as a lonely Georgia housewife with three personalities. Woodward is astonishing as Eve White, Eve Black and a woman simply called Jane. What Woodward does with each of the characters she plays in the film is even more impressive now nearly sixty years later. Young actors today need to study this film if they're serious about acting, that's how good she is. Woodward was born in Georgia so the accent she uses in the film is real. David Wayne, Lee J. Cobb and even Vince Edwards are part of the supporting cast. This latest Blu-ray presentation from the Fox catalog should be a must for fans of Joanne Woodward. ""The Three Faces of Eve"" is 91 minutes and was filmed in Cinemascope(Aspect Ratio: 2.35.1). It contains the following subtitles: English SDH, Spanish and French. Audio is as follows: English DTS-HD Master Audio 1.0 and Spanish Dolby Digital 1.0. Special Features include Fox Movietone News of the 30th Annual Academy Awards and the Original Theatrical Trailer.

Eve starts having what she thinks are ""blackouts,"" but eventually learns that she has a split personality. The movie tells the story of Eve's journey to a psychiatrist who helps her determine who the personalities are and how they came to inhabit her body. During the exploration, Eve loses a husband and her child, but then gains a different husband and her child in the end. The fact that this movie is based on a real-life person makes the film all the more compelling.Joanne Woodward plays the part of Eve, Eve and Jane, and she was unbelievable in this film!

It is one of the first films to explore the condition of human psyche and what happens when it gets damaged.The filmmakers renamed Chris "" Eve"" and this film is about the discovery by her therapist that she has 2 very different personalities.  The first personality ""Eve White"" is a dowdy housewife who always does what she is told, has a jerk husband named Ralph, and a daughter named Bonnie.  "" Eve Black"" the second personality is a fly by the night party girl who sleeps around, drinks, does whatever she wants to whomever she wants and doesn't care about the consequences.  It is as if 2 very different people are living inside the same body.  After years of therapy and a stint in a mental hospital a third personality with no memory that calls herself "" Jane"" emerges.  Jane is almost like a middle ground between the other 2.  She is kind and caring, but she also stands up for herself and doesn't tolerate being treated badly.  Eventually, through the use of hypnosis, Eve's therapist gets Eve to remember the traumatic event that led to the split in the first place.  After that both Eves disappear and only Jane is left.  Eve, as a whole person, leaves her husband, gets together with a new man and eventually brings her daughter home to live with her.Although Hollywood did take some liberties with this story, it is one of the first examples that a story based on truth can often be more fascinating than anything that writers can come up with.

333524,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,6302779782,Phillip Oliver,"[2, 3]","A Georgia housewife suffering from multiple personalities seeks psychiatric care in this film based on a true story. Joanne Woodward, in her tour-de-force Oscar performance, portrays the troubled young woman, whose personalities are identified as ""Eve White"" - an insecure and troubled woman, ""Eve Black"" - her alter ego - a loose, party girl and finally ""Jane,"" a stable and headstrong woman who is the dominant personality.Woodward's acting is definitely the high point of the film. Despite the filmmaker's attempts at portraying a psychological disorder in an understanding light, there are several problems. First of all, the widescreen Cinemascope format was probably not the way to go with such an intimate subject matter. This is a film that begs for close-ups and confined scenes - the wide  screen format makes that hard to do. The cinematography and set design also doesn't help and the film looks rather like a cheap tv documentary or an episode of ""Dragnet."" Another problem is the use of humorous passages and dialog that result in the film losing its tone. Although a scene with David Wayne (as Woodward's country bumpkin husband) and ""Eve Black"" comes across as pretty funny, it hurts the film on the whole and leaves the audience confused about the films true intentions. Finally, the incident and root of Eve's psychosis is never fully explained in enough detail and leaves the viewer with more questions than answers.Look for Nancy Kulp (""Miss Jane Hathaway"" on ""Beverly Hillbillies"") in a brief scene near the end as Woodward's mother.The dvd transfer is very good, presented in the original wide screen format.

333527,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,6302779782,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[3, 3]","This is one of the finest movies of Joanne Woodward in which she performs the role of a housewife torn between three contrasting personalities; Eve White, Eve Black and Jane. This is a real life story about multiple personality disorder suffered by Chris Costner Sizemore of South Carolina, and diagnosed by Drs. Corbett H. Thigpen, and Hervey M. Cleckley. This story was brilliantly adapted for the screen by the work of Nunnally Johnson, who also wrote for such classics as: How to Marry a Millionaire, Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation, and We're not Married.Woodward plays the role of socially repressed Eve White, a housewife and mother of a daughter, Bonnie White (Terry Ann Ross). The second personality is the oversexed Eve Black, clad in sexy bras, and short skirts, drinking, smoking, and always ready for fun at the local bar; and the third person called Jane who is relatively normal. The viewers see a metamorphosis in Eve White who changes from perfect housewife to a downright difficult lady. The real drama unfolds in the offices of Dr. Curtis Luther (Lee Cobb) who methodically investigates the psychological disorder of his patient and comes to the conclusion that Eve suffers from the split personalities of three contrasting women. There is a great deal of drama when the viewers see Eve strangling her only daughter when she ""appears"" as Eve Black (Eve Black considers that is not her child). The constant fights and domestic problems with her husband Ralph White (David Wayne), and his visits to see her at the psychiatric hospital are very moving. When she is resident of the state facility for mentally disturbed, we find more of the irresponsible and selfish nature of Eve Black who hangs out in the bars, picks men and finally disappoints them, no matter how much it hurts them. In almost all instances we see the appearance of conservative Eve White after Eve black transforms herself; that is, when she sobers of and tries to understand what has happened, and feel embarrassed that she is sitting in the bar in skimpy clothes.There is an interesting history behind casting. When director Nunnally Johnson's tried to cast actress Jennifer Jones for the leading role; she confessed being terrified of the part. June Allyson simply refused to play, and Judy Garland at first agreed to take part in the movie, but when saw the actual films of Chris Sizemore undergoing psychotherapy, and transformation to split personalities, she got scared. Joanne Woodward read the script on the train from New York to Los Angeles and confessed that she was so afraid of the role she almost returned to New York. Johnson wanted to have Sizemore interviewed for the movie, but her psychiatrists said that she was not ready for the experience. Sizemore continued to manifest new personalities after her supposed cure, up to 22 personalities in all, until 1970s. She did not see the film until 1974, and she found it moving and praised the performance of Joanne Woodward.There are many situations that are close to the real story. Just as Chris Sizemore had displayed in her therapy, Woodward used a Southern accent for the two Eves and dropped this accent when she became Jane. One change Johnson suggested was making the transformations slowly than Sizemore had actually experienced in the real life. During therapy, Sizemore switched personalities fairly quickly, but the director felt that would not be believable to a movie audience unfamiliar with multiple personality disorder. Each event is chronicled accurately, and as the years in which it all took place pass, viewers see personalities appear and disappear, and transform to one another. One thing that is overlooked over the years in many reviews is the brilliant portrayal of Dr. Luther by Lee Cobb, who has offered brilliant performance and strongly complements the fine work of Woodward.The Chris Costner Sizemore Papers span the time period 1952-1989, with the bulk of the papers dating between 1956 and 1979. These are currently available at the Duke University library (Duke.edu). The collection consists largely of correspondence; diaries and writings by Sizemore; clippings centered on film and book promotions and speaking engagements. The papers provide an in-depth look into the life of a woman with a rare disorder who later came to clearly articulate her life to the public.",5,Joanne Woodward is simply spectacular,1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,4350,"['one', 'finest', 'movies', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'role', 'housewife', 'torn', 'three', 'contrasting', 'personalities', 'Eve', 'White', 'Eve', 'Black', 'Jane', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'multiple', 'personality', 'disorder', 'suffered', 'Chris', 'Costner', 'Sizemore', 'South', 'Carolina', 'diagnosed', 'Drs', 'Corbett', 'H.', 'Thigpen', 'Hervey', 'M.', 'Cleckley', 'story', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'adapted', 'screen', 'work', 'Nunnally', 'Johnson', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'such', 'classics', 'How', 'Marry', 'Millionaire', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'Vacation', ""'re"", 'not', 'Married.Woodward', 'role', 'socially', 'repressed', 'Eve', 'White', 'housewife', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Bonnie', 'White', 'Terry', 'Ann', 'Ross', 'second', 'personality', 'oversexed', 'Eve', 'Black', 'clad', 'sexy', 'bras', 'short', 'skirts', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'always', 'ready', 'fun', 'local', 'bar', 'third', 'person', 'called', 'Jane', 'who', 'relatively', 'normal', 'viewers', 'see', 'metamorphosis', 'Eve', 'White', 'who', 'perfect', 'housewife', 'downright', 'difficult', 'lady', 'real', 'drama', 'unfolds', 'offices', 'Dr.', 'Curtis', 'Luther', 'Lee', 'Cobb', 'who', 'methodically', 'psychological', 'disorder', 'patient', 'conclusion', 'Eve', 'suffers', 'split', 'personalities', 'three', 'contrasting', 'women', 'great', 'deal', 'drama', 'when', 'viewers', 'see', 'Eve', 'strangling', 'only', 'daughter', 'when', 'Eve', 'Black', 'Eve', 'Black', 'considers', 'not', 'child', 'constant', 'fights', 'domestic', 'problems', 'husband', 'Ralph', 'White', 'David', 'Wayne', 'visits', 'see', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'are', 'very', 'moving', 'When', 'resident', 'state', 'facility', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'find', 'more', 'irresponsible', 'selfish', 'nature', 'Eve', 'Black', 'who', 'out', 'bars', 'picks', 'men', 'finally', 'disappoints', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'almost', 'instances', 'see', 'appearance', 'conservative', 'Eve', 'White', 'Eve', 'black', 'transforms', 'when', 'sobers', 'tries', 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'feel', 'embarrassed', 'sitting', 'bar', 'skimpy', 'clothes.There', 'interesting', 'history', 'casting', 'When', 'director', 'Nunnally', 'Johnson', 'tried', 'cast', 'actress', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'leading', 'role', 'confessed', 'being', 'terrified', 'part', 'June', 'Allyson', 'simply', 'refused', 'play', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'first', 'agreed', 'take', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'saw', 'actual', 'films', 'Chris', 'Sizemore', 'undergoing', 'psychotherapy', 'transformation', 'split', 'personalities', 'got', 'scared', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'read', 'script', 'train', 'New', 'York', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'confessed', 'was', 'so', 'afraid', 'role', 'almost', 'returned', 'New', 'York', 'Johnson', 'wanted', 'have', 'Sizemore', 'interviewed', 'movie', 'psychiatrists', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'experience', 'Sizemore', 'continued', 'manifest', 'new', 'personalities', 'supposed', 'cure', 'up', '22', 'personalities', '1970s', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'film', '1974', 'found', 'moving', 'praised', 'performance', 'Joanne', 'Woodward.There', 'are', 'many', 'situations', 'are', 'close', 'real', 'story', 'Just', 'Chris', 'Sizemore', 'had', 'displayed', 'therapy', 'Woodward', 'used', 'Southern', 'accent', 'two', 'Eves', 'dropped', 'accent', 'when', 'became', 'Jane', 'One', 'change', 'Johnson', 'suggested', 'was', 'making', 'transformations', 'slowly', 'Sizemore', 'had', 'actually', 'experienced', 'real', 'life', 'therapy', 'Sizemore', 'switched', 'personalities', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'director', 'felt', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'believable', 'movie', 'audience', 'unfamiliar', 'multiple', 'personality', 'disorder', 'event', 'chronicled', 'accurately', 'years', 'took', 'place', 'pass', 'viewers', 'see', 'personalities', 'appear', 'disappear', 'transform', 'one', 'One', 'thing', 'overlooked', 'years', 'many', 'reviews', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'Dr.', 'Luther', 'Lee', 'Cobb', 'who', 'offered', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'strongly', 'fine', 'work', 'Woodward.The', 'Chris', 'Costner', 'Sizemore', 'Papers', 'span', 'time', 'period', '1952-1989', 'bulk', 'papers', 'dating', '1956', '1979', 'are', 'currently', 'available', 'Duke', 'University', 'library', 'Duke.edu', 'collection', 'largely', 'correspondence', 'diaries', 'writings', 'Sizemore', 'clippings', 'centered', 'film', 'book', 'promotions', 'speaking', 'engagements', 'papers', 'provide', 'in-depth', 'look', 'life', 'woman', 'rare', 'disorder', 'who', 'later', 'came', 'clearly', 'articulate', 'life', 'public']",N/A

Cobb (psychiatrist), Joanne Woodward (Eve White, Eve Black, and Jane), and David Wayne (Eve White's Husband) in some of their finest work.  Joanne deserves best-actress Oscar 1957 for this performance.David Wayne gave a strong performance as the long-suffering husband.  He reminds me of my father, a retired career sergeant.  Today, and only in the United States, men are almost totally opposite this character, and much less (he's been beaten beyond recognition by political correctness).This movie is remarkable in its treatment of a true story of a woman named Eve White, traumatized as a child, who split into two alternate personalities named Eve Black and later Jane.  Thus, we have Eve White, Eve Black, and Jane, respectively: a bland, docile girl; a party girl; and a normal girl (or rather a balance of the former two).  But, it turns out, it was really the personality Jane, who was the real Eve White/Eve Black.Through the care and expertise (particularly hypnosis) of the doctor (Lee Cobb), the psychotic trio resolved the maddening issue of whose body it is when Jane ""remembered"" the childhood that neither Eve White nor Eve Black could.  It was Jane, as the child Eve, being forced to kiss the dead maternal grandmother that precipitated all this evil.  Eve White attempted sublimation with each new personality; it just only got worse.Simply put, Jane (Eve's real ego) was the one who suffered the pivotal trauma.  Then the real ego buried itself first under Eve Black, then under Jane.  Haply, Jane, the real ego, outlived them all.A must see for film aficionados.  Although, this is a verified true story, it is also ""fictionalized"" by Hollywood to reach the masses.  As a clinical study, it would not have gotten made.  But as roman a clef, it won a best-actress Oscar, and brought mental illness and women's issues to the light.

Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[4, 5]","Producer/director/screenwriter Nunnally Johnson's THE THREE FACES OF EVE (1957, Fox) may be the most truthful portrait of mental illness ever.  It is based on a book by doctors Corbett H. Thigpen and Harvey M. Cleckley, which tells the true story of a troubled Georgia wife and mother.  In the early 1950's, a woman named Eve White visits a psychiatrist named Dr. Luther (Lee J. Cobb).  She is having disturbing nightmares.  It turns out that Eve White has a split personality she shares with a woman named Eve Black.  Joanne Woodward won a Best Actress Oscar as both Eves; it is a remarkable performance that will also later involve a third personality named Jane.  Eve White is a troubled and insecure wife and mother.  Eve Black is a seductive partygoer.  Jane is a sympathetic and intelligent middle balance.  Dr. Luther's goal is to get rid of both Eves so that Jane can dominate.I suffer from mental illness myself.  I am insecure, depressed, and have moments of anger.  I see two excellent psychiatrists regularly at Kaiser.  So I speak knowledgeably when  I say that Johnson gets the details right in THREE FACES OF EVE.  The personality changes are subtle.  There is no couch--Dr. Luther sits smoking in a desk chair, while one of the Woodward personalities (a real acting tour de force) sits in a chair at the opposite end of a long screen.  (The movie is brilliantly photographed in B&W; and CinemaScope by THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS' Stanley Cortez.)  This is psychiatry as it really is--subtle, difficult, painful, ultimately liberating.  The legendary Alistair Cooke gives it credibility as host and infrequent narrator.  Lee J. Cobb is superb as always, and David Wayne is also excellent as a perplexed and unsympathetic husband.The DVD of THE THREE FACES OF EVE includes an audio commentary by film historian Aubrey Solomon, a theatrical trailer, and a Movietone News clip of the Academy Awards.  Plus a mint condition studio print.

Thigpen & Hervey M. Cleckley, who also helped write the screenplay. It was based on their case of Chris Costner Sizemore, also known as Eve White, a woman they suggested might suffer from multiple personality disorder. Sizemore's identity was concealed in interviews and this film, and was not revealed to the public until 1975.Joanne Woodward won the Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the first actress to win an Oscar for portraying three different personalities (Eve White, Eve Black and Jane). The Three Faces of Eve also became the first film to win the Best Actress award without getting nominated in another category, and the last for nearly 31 years until Jodie Foster won the award for The Accused.Eve White is a timid, self-effacing wife and mother who has severe headaches and occasional blackouts. Eventually she is sent to see a personality psychiatrist Dr. Luther, and while having a conversation, her &#34;alter personality&#34;, wild, fun-loving Eve Black, emerges. Eve White is sent to an asylum.Dr. Luther considers both Eve White and Eve Black to be incomplete and inadequate personalities. Most of the film depicts Luther's attempts to understand and deal with these two faces of Eve. He eventually prompts her to remember a traumatic event in Eve&#8217;s childhood. Eve's grief and terror led to her &#34;splitting off&#34; into two distinctly different personalities.Under hypnosis at one session, a third personality appears, the relatively stable Jane. After discovering the cause of her disorder, Jane is gradually able to remember everything that has ever happened to all three personalities.The book by Thigpen and Cleckley was rushed into publication, and the film rights were immediately sold to director Nunnally Johnson in 1957, apparently to capitalize on public interest in multiple personalities following the publication of Shirley Jackson's 1954 novel, The Birds' Nest, which was also made into a film in 1957 titled Lizzie.Chris Costner Sizemore has written at some length about her experiences as the real &#34;Eve.&#34; In her 1958 book, The Final Face of Eve, she used the pseudonym Evelyn Lancaster. In her 1977 book I'm Eve, she revealed her true identity. She has also written a follow-up book, A Mind Of My Own (1989).Woodward &#8211; at the time a relative unknown in Hollywood &#8211; won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and later went on to play Dr. Cornelia Wilbur in the film Sybil. It was a reversal of roles for Ms. Woodward, who played the psychiatrist who diagnosed Sybil Dorsett (played by Sally Field, who subsequently won an Emmy for her portrayal) with multiple personality disorder and subsequently led her through treatment.",3,Three Faces of Eve,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,2798,"['Three', 'Faces', 'Eve', '1957', 'American', 'film', 'adaptation', 'based', 'book', 'psychiatrists', 'Corbett', 'H.', 'Thigpen', 'Hervey', 'M.', 'Cleckley', 'who', 'also', 'helped', 'write', 'screenplay', 'was', 'based', 'case', 'Chris', 'Costner', 'Sizemore', 'also', 'known', 'Eve', 'White', 'woman', 'suggested', 'might', 'suffer', 'multiple', 'personality', 'disorder', 'Sizemore', 'identity', 'was', 'concealed', 'interviews', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'revealed', 'public', '1975.Joanne', 'Woodward', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'making', 'first', 'actress', 'win', 'Oscar', 'portraying', 'three', 'different', 'personalities', 'Eve', 'White', 'Eve', 'Black', 'Jane', 'Three', 'Faces', 'Eve', 'also', 'became', 'first', 'film', 'win', 'Best', 'Actress', 'award', 'getting', 'nominated', 'category', 'last', 'nearly', '31', 'years', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'won', 'award', 'Accused.Eve', 'White', 'timid', 'self-effacing', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'severe', 'headaches', 'occasional', 'blackouts', 'Eventually', 'sent', 'see', 'personality', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Luther', 'having', 'conversation', '34', 'alter', 'personality', '34', 'wild', 'fun-loving', 'Eve', 'Black', 'Eve', 'White', 'sent', 'asylum.Dr', 'considers', 'Eve', 'White', 'Eve', 'Black', 'be', 'incomplete', 'inadequate', 'personalities', 'Most', 'film', 'Luther', 'attempts', 'understand', 'deal', 'two', 'Eve', 'eventually', 'remember', 'traumatic', 'event', 'Eve', '8217', 's', 'childhood', 'Eve', 'grief', 'terror', 'led', '34', 'splitting', 'off', '34', 'two', 'distinctly', 'different', 'personalities.Under', 'hypnosis', 'one', 'session', 'third', 'personality', 'relatively', 'stable', 'Jane', 'discovering', 'cause', 'disorder', 'Jane', 'gradually', 'able', 'remember', 'everything', 'ever', 'happened', 'three', 'personalities.The', 'book', 'Thigpen', 'Cleckley', 'was', 'rushed', 'publication', 'film', 'rights', 'were', 'immediately', 'sold', 'director', 'Nunnally', 'Johnson', '1957', 'apparently', 'capitalize', 'public', 'interest', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'following', 'publication', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', '1954', 'novel', 'Birds', 'Nest', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'film', '1957', 'titled', 'Lizzie.Chris', 'Costner', 'Sizemore', 'written', 'length', 'experiences', 'real', '34', 'Eve.', '34', '1958', 'book', 'Final', 'Face', 'Eve', 'used', 'pseudonym', 'Evelyn', 'Lancaster', '1977', 'book', ""'m"", 'Eve', 'revealed', 'true', 'identity', 'also', 'written', 'follow-up', 'book', 'A', 'Mind', 'My', 'Own', '1989', '.Woodward', '8211', 'time', 'relative', 'unknown', 'Hollywood', '8211', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'later', 'went', 'play', 'Dr.', 'Cornelia', 'Wilbur', 'film', 'Sybil', 'was', 'reversal', 'roles', 'Ms.', 'Woodward', 'who', 'played', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'diagnosed', 'Sybil', 'Dorsett', 'played', 'Sally', 'Field', 'who', 'subsequently', 'won', 'Emmy', 'portrayal', 'multiple', 'personality', 'disorder', 'subsequently', 'led', 'treatment']",N/A

It was the first examination of multiple personality disorder in a dramatic setting. Joanne Woodward gives a stunning performance as Eve a southern housewife who suffers from migranes, seems in constant emotional turmoil and has memory lapses. Her psychiatrist Dr. Luther (played by the marvelous character actor Lee J. Cobb) believes he's treating a common form of depression but he's startled to discover during one of his sessions that he's not speaking with Eve but with a whole different person. Based on the famous book documenting the real case (and not a ""novel"" as per the DVD case) by Corbett Thigpen, MD and Harvey Cleckley MD, Nunnally Johnson's script may be a bit pedantic for audiences today but there's still powerful performances and sharp direction that makes it worthwhile.This special edition from Fox part of its ""Studio Classics"" collection includes a commentary by film historian Aubrey Solomon. Solomon's commentary provides precise and fascinating tidbits about how the film varied from the book and from the real case in addition to the usual background on the production of the movie. There's also a Movietone News Reel included of the Academy Awards (Joanne Woodward won for Best Actress). The original theatrical trailer is included and the restored image and sound are quite good.Well worth picking up for fans of classic Hollywood movies from the 50's.
