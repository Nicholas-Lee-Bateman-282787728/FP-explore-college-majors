364826,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,6303215645,Israel Drazin,"[2, 2]","Fans of the close to three dozen Chief Inspector Morse TV series are very familiar with the plot methodology that Morse usually misreads the events and the personalities involved, but finally gets it right. He also usually mocks his assistant Sergeant Lewis who has his own misreading of the events and persons. This tale seems different. It raises the question: will Lewis get it right while Morse does not, and will the police be able to punish the person or persons who killed people?Morse, in this case, is called to an apparent suicide of a man who he knew as a very competent professor, who was suffering from a disabling disease. The man's wife is a beautiful woman who Morse loved, still loves, was engaged to, and still wants to marry. A doctor who is involved with assisted suicides reveals that the man was so disabled that it was impossible for him to shoot himself in the head.There are interesting characters beside the wife. The doctor's wife was having an affair with the dead man's son-in-law. The wife and child of the son-in-law were killed in a strange automobile accident at 3 AM some years before the apparent suicide. There is abundant evidence that the son-in-law killed the apparent suicide.

364827,A2ONIL7HAD8XG7,6303215645,"""johnnyrogue""","[19, 20]","This one, penned by the always reliable Daniel Boyle (who also wrote &quot;Second Time Around&quot; and &quot;Deadly Slumber&quot; among others), has to be one of the best Morse episodes.  True, it would most  certainly make Morse purists shudder because its plot developments are  inconsistent with the Morse character as he is developed in the novels (in  the novel &quot;The Riddle of the Third Mile,&quot; which was later adapted  for television as &quot;The Last Enemy,&quot; refers to a character named  Wendy who was Morse's lost love back at school; in &quot;Dead on Time&quot;  this lost love of Morse's is named Susan).  And true, the plot developments  are at times illogical.  But, this film's plot is only secondary; what is  of primary importance is the character of Morse and the kind of sensitivity  John Thaw gives this character when he is confronted with this, perhaps his  most emotionally charged case.  The plot:  Morse is called to investigate  the apparant suicide of Oxford don Henry Fallon.  To make things  complicated, the investigation leads Morse to suspect that the suicide was  indeed murder set up to look like suicide.  To make things more  complicated, Henry Fallon was the husband of Susan Fallon, the woman Morse  was engaged to so many years ago.  To top off all these complications,  there is a reemergence of feeling on the part of Morse, a rekindling of  this love that he once had.  You throw into the mix a bit of Shubert, some  hard detective work by Lewis, an uneaten chocolate digestive in Strange's  dest, and what you have is vintage Morse.  Kudos to John Thaw, as always.  He's a marvel and a skilled actor, capable of portraying a Morse that is  both angry and tender.

It begins with a startled look on Morse's face when he realizes the dead body belongs to the husband of his lover who broke his heart (and ruined his university career) by leaving him many years ago.  It ends with Sergeant Lewis protecting his partner with a touching loyalty expressed through subtly phrased lines.  Susan Fallon (Joanna David) is the lovely, accomplished blonde with whom we would imagine Morse falling in love (and surely never completely out of love.)  Despite Morse's usual ill temper and irritation with the world, we forgive him his faults in those scenes when his blue eyes soften and tear with the pain of loving this woman.  (Haven't we all loved and lost?)  The script skillfully balances the dark side of human nature and its need for revenge with the hope that no matter how much we lose, love can still endure.  This is a special episode to be savored many times for its intimate glimpses into our favorite detective's heart.

364829,A319KYEIAZ3SON,6303215645,Mary Whipple,"[5, 5]","In what may be John Thaw's most powerfully acted episode in the Inspector Morse series, Inspector Morse (John Thaw) investigates the alleged suicide of Henry Fallon, an Oxford don who has been suffering from a fatal neurological illness.  Morse soon discovers that the man's widow is Susan Fallon (Joanna David), his former fianc&eacute;e, the woman who jilted him and left him unable to love anyone else.Several issues arise during the investigation, one of which involves the Dignity Society, a group which believes in suicide as a dignified death when there is no hope left.  Morse, however, believes that this was no suicide, and as he investigates what he believes is a murder, he focuses on Susan Fallon's son-in-law, a young man who owed Henry Fallon a great deal of money and who was responsible for the car crash which killed the Fallons' only daughter and grandson.The drama here is largely internal, as Morse becomes more and more involved with Susan and less and less objective about the case.  Sgt. Lewis (Kevin Whately), sympathetic to what he is discovering about his usually taciturn boss, tries to keep the case on track without interfering with Morse's renewed feelings for Susan.As always, the acting is superb, but here there are powerful confrontations involving Morse and those around him, and much more attention is paid to the personal aspects of Morse's life.  The conclusion, involving Sgt. Lewis, highlights Lewis's sensitivity and empathy toward Morse.  A powerful, dramatic insight into the inner life of  Inspector Morse, and arguably the best acted episode of this outstanding series.  n Mary Whipple",5,"Inspector Morse at his most ""human.""",1163289600,"11 12, 2006",2006,1631,"['what', 'may', 'be', 'John', 'Thaw', 'most', 'powerfully', 'acted', 'episode', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'series', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'John', 'Thaw', 'alleged', 'suicide', 'Henry', 'Fallon', 'Oxford', 'don', 'who', 'been', 'suffering', 'fatal', 'neurological', 'illness', 'Morse', 'soon', 'man', 'widow', 'Susan', 'Fallon', 'Joanna', 'David', 'former', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'woman', 'who', 'jilted', 'left', 'unable', 'love', 'anyone', 'else.Several', 'issues', 'arise', 'investigation', 'one', 'Dignity', 'Society', 'group', 'suicide', 'dignified', 'death', 'when', 'hope', 'left', 'Morse', 'however', 'was', 'suicide', 'what', 'murder', 'Susan', 'Fallon', 'son-in-law', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'owed', 'Henry', 'Fallon', 'great', 'deal', 'money', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'car', 'crash', 'killed', 'Fallons', 'only', 'daughter', 'grandson.The', 'drama', 'here', 'largely', 'internal', 'Morse', 'more', 'more', 'involved', 'Susan', 'less', 'less', 'objective', 'case', 'Sgt', 'Lewis', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'sympathetic', 'what', 'discovering', 'usually', 'taciturn', 'boss', 'tries', 'keep', 'case', 'track', 'interfering', 'Morse', 'renewed', 'feelings', 'Susan.As', 'always', 'acting', 'superb', 'here', 'are', 'powerful', 'confrontations', 'involving', 'Morse', 'much', 'more', 'attention', 'paid', 'personal', 'aspects', 'Morse', 'life', 'conclusion', 'involving', 'Sgt', 'Lewis', 'Lewis', 'sensitivity', 'empathy', 'Morse', 'powerful', 'dramatic', 'insight', 'inner', 'life', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'arguably', 'best', 'acted', 'episode', 'outstanding', 'series', 'n', 'Mary', 'Whipple']",N/A

That may be all right for the average mystery, but not for Morse - his cases never are; that's part of the attraction of this series.  Upon further probing we learn this is really a murder or is it?  With a Dignity Society involved and several potential suspects, this case could go in several directions.  Plenty of twists and turns before this one is over.  For icing from the personal Morse we usually find something intellectual or cultural, but this time we are given romance.  It seems Morse was heavily involved with the deceased's wife, prior to her marriage when Morse was at University - involved to the extent that they were engaged to be married.  Now that she is no longer committed, the old spark is re-kindled mutually.  This involvement affects Morse's objectivity in handling the case causing Lewis to engage himself more than usual in the investigation; he learns some details which he is reluctant to reveal to Morse because of his respect and fondness for his superior.  How the mystery and the romance play out and how Lewis handles his dilemma are all revealed in the video.  Certainly the most melancholy of the entire series.

364831,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6303215645,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","This is another stellar episode in the Inspector Morse series of crime dramas. In Dead on Time, Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) and DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) get called in to an apparent suicide. The dead man, Henry Fallon, turns out to be the crippled husband of Susan Fallon (Joanna David) who was the love of Morse's life at one point in time. Just as the detectives wrap up the case and the coroner's inquiry turns in a verdict of suicide, Henry Fallon's physician, Dr. John Marriatt calls them in and voices his suspicion that the death may not be due to suicide at all, given Fallon's physical limitations.The detectives then turn on to the obvious suspect, Fallon's son-in-law, who had been in debt to Fallon. But is it really as simple as that? Things get complicated by Morse's obvious partiality to Susan, and it becomes evident to Lewis that Morse is letting his feelings for Susan affect his thinking and handling of the case. This episode tugged at my heart particularly because Morse shows his true feelings for a woman here. Susan is still very much the love of Morse's life, and even though he clearly wishes for them to be together, things are not so simple on Susan's part, and her feelings are a bit more ambivalent. It is rather sad to watch Morse get thwarted in love, especially knowing what a good man he is and deserving of happiness.
