715966,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00006HAX7,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[10, 22]","I'll probably get slammed for this, but I didn't really care for this movie all that much.  I wanted to like it, I really did, but it got a little weird for my tastes.  I really like Jeff Daniels, and I thought I would really enjoy this film, which he wrote and directed, and is also based on a play he wrote.Jeff Daniels stars as Rueben Soady, a resident of the UP (Upper Peninsula) in upstate Michigan and comes from a long line of hunters.  In the story, deer season is beginning again, and Rueben has yet to 'bag a buck', or, to put it in English, he has never shot a deer.  This makes him sort of an outcast in his community, a man in his early forties, from a long line of hunters, and he has never shot a deer.Well, as I said, deer hunting season is starting, and Rueben meets up with his father, Albert Soady, played by Harve Presnell (Fargo), his younger brother Remnar, and a really weird friend named Jimmer Negamanee at the family hunting cabin.  When this movie started, it had the makings of a warm, lighthearted comedy, but soon took a turn for the weird.  I have never been hunting, and I enjoyed much of the talk, reminiscing and adherence to traditions displayed within the film.  There were some truly funny scenes, but the movie soon started to incorporate elements of mysticism (Rueben's wife is a Native American and she is featured in a dream Rueben has), the occult, and the unexplained.  There were references to aliens, mystical bears, and ancient Native American rituals.  I wouldn't have minded it much, but I thought too much focus was placed on these parts, with over extended scenes involving all three.  Also, it seemed to me that the Native American rituals were sort of played off as being more hokey than a part of a vanishing culture, a vehicle to get a few laughs and not much else, giving me a sense of disrespect, but I am sure that wasn't the intention.Another scene that seemed to drag on was one where Rueben somehow went into a catatonic state and his father and brother decided to try and bring him out of it by having a sleeping Jimmer expel gas on his face.  Now, when men get together in a setting such as this, they do tend to revert to more primal tendencies, I will not argue that, but this all seemed very silly and childish.  I don't mind silliness, but when taken to the lengths it was in this movie, it was just too much for me.The movie had a number of good points, as I liked all the actors, but the plot veered off into enforced strangeness once too often for my tastes.  The potential was here from a great little movie, had they stuck more to reality.  I am sure a number of people, especially those who live in the northern Midwest or those with hunting experiences probably got more out of this than me, enjoy it more than I did.  There was a lot of quirkiness in the movie, which I generally enjoy when it comes naturally, but here is seemed like it was forced.I am giving this movie three stars as it there were funny parts here and there, and it was imaginative, and I like Jeff Daniels, but I feel there could have been more here than there was...no real extras here in this full screen presentation.",3,Maybe I have to be da Yooper to get it,1074643200,"01 21, 2004",2004,3165,"[""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'slammed', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'movie', 'that', 'much', 'wanted', 'like', 'really', 'did', 'got', 'little', 'weird', 'tastes', 'really', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'thought', 'would', 'really', 'enjoy', 'film', 'wrote', 'directed', 'also', 'based', 'play', 'Daniels', 'stars', 'Rueben', 'Soady', 'resident', 'UP', 'Upper', 'Peninsula', 'upstate', 'Michigan', 'long', 'line', 'hunters', 'story', 'deer', 'season', 'beginning', 'again', 'Rueben', 'yet', ""'bag"", 'buck', 'put', 'English', 'never', 'shot', 'deer', 'sort', 'outcast', 'community', 'man', 'early', 'forties', 'long', 'line', 'hunters', 'never', 'shot', 'deer.Well', 'said', 'deer', 'hunting', 'season', 'starting', 'Rueben', 'up', 'father', 'Albert', 'Soady', 'played', 'Harve', 'Presnell', 'Fargo', 'younger', 'brother', 'Remnar', 'really', 'weird', 'friend', 'named', 'Jimmer', 'Negamanee', 'family', 'hunting', 'cabin', 'When', 'movie', 'started', 'had', 'makings', 'warm', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'soon', 'took', 'turn', 'weird', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'hunting', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'talk', 'reminiscing', 'adherence', 'traditions', 'displayed', 'film', 'were', 'truly', 'funny', 'scenes', 'movie', 'soon', 'started', 'incorporate', 'elements', 'mysticism', 'Rueben', 'wife', 'Native', 'American', 'featured', 'dream', 'Rueben', 'occult', 'unexplained', 'were', 'references', 'aliens', 'mystical', 'bears', 'ancient', 'Native', 'American', 'rituals', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'minded', 'much', 'thought', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'was', 'placed', 'parts', 'extended', 'scenes', 'involving', 'three', 'Also', 'seemed', 'Native', 'American', 'rituals', 'were', 'sort', 'played', 'off', 'being', 'more', 'hokey', 'part', 'vanishing', 'culture', 'vehicle', 'get', 'few', 'laughs', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'giving', 'sense', 'disrespect', 'am', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'intention.Another', 'scene', 'seemed', 'drag', 'was', 'one', 'where', 'Rueben', 'somehow', 'went', 'catatonic', 'state', 'father', 'brother', 'decided', 'try', 'bring', 'having', 'sleeping', 'Jimmer', 'expel', 'gas', 'face', 'Now', 'when', 'men', 'get', 'together', 'setting', 'such', 'do', 'tend', 'revert', 'more', 'primal', 'tendencies', 'will', 'not', 'argue', 'seemed', 'very', 'silly', 'childish', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'silliness', 'when', 'taken', 'lengths', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'me.The', 'movie', 'had', 'number', 'good', 'points', 'liked', 'actors', 'plot', 'veered', 'off', 'enforced', 'strangeness', 'once', 'too', 'often', 'tastes', 'potential', 'was', 'here', 'great', 'little', 'movie', 'had', 'stuck', 'more', 'reality', 'am', 'sure', 'number', 'people', 'especially', 'who', 'live', 'northern', 'Midwest', 'hunting', 'experiences', 'probably', 'got', 'more', 'enjoy', 'more', 'did', 'was', 'lot', 'quirkiness', 'movie', 'generally', 'enjoy', 'when', 'naturally', 'here', 'seemed', 'was', 'forced.I', 'am', 'giving', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'were', 'funny', 'parts', 'here', 'there', 'was', 'imaginative', 'like', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'feel', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'here', 'was', 'real', 'extras', 'here', 'full', 'screen', 'presentation']",Escanaba in Da Moonlight

Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","Based on a play by Jeff Daniels--who also directed and stars--ESCANABA IN DA MOONLIGHT is the story of a family-owned deer camp where the Soady clan meets every year to hunt.  This year the family in attendance is patriarch Albert Soady (Harve Presnell) and sons Rueben (Jeff Daniels) and Remnar (Joey Albright.)  On this occasion they are joined by area eccentric ""The Jimmer"" (Wayne David Parker) and  terribly befuddled game warden Ranger Tom T. Treado (Randall Godwin.)  But when it comes to shooting deer, Rueben is jinxed and everybody in the whole town knows it, and if he doesn't make a kill this year he will become the oldest member of the Soady family who hasn't bagged a deer.Fortunately, Rueben is married to a Native American woman named Wolf Moon Dance (Kimberly Guerrero), and she has come up with a tribal cure that involves some chanting, porcupine urine, and a potion made with milk, earthworms, and moose testicles.  But it seems her cure may be a bit too strong for the boys: before the night ends, they hear strange chants, see strange lights, endure possession, and almost explode in what has to be one of the most bizarre series of fart jokes ever put to film.  There is indeed a lot of humor in the film, and even some touching emotion.  But there's also a big problem with it.The play is set in the Michigan upper penisula, and the humor relies a great deal on how well you know that culture--and how well you know the dialect.  Some of it I got and some of it I didn't, just went right over my head.  The performances are good, and the actors have a lot of fun with it, and if you don't bust a gut over the fart joke there's probably something wrong with you.

715983,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00006HAX7,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","I saw Jeff Daniels in concert over at the Big Tent Chautauqua next door in Wisconsin and in between singing his songs and playing the guitar he talked about having made a movie about hunting up on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  There are not a lot of movies about the U.P. (""Anatomy of a Murder"" comes to mind), so I decided to track down the film and check it out.  What I found was ""Escanaba in da Moonlight,"" which is based on a play that Daniel wrote for the Purple Rose Theater in Chelsea, Michigan.  Guy Sanville directed the play and helped come up with the story, but here Daniels does the screenplay, handles the directing chores, and plays the main character as well.  That would be Rueben Soady, who is the shame of both the Soady family and the town of Escanaba because he has never shot a buck.  That means Reuben in ""buckless"" (not to mention being called ""Bambi's best friend), and this little 2001 film is about his attempt to do something to rectify the situation.So, basically, if are not into hunting or tall tales told by people who hunt, then you should probably pass on this movie.  The exceptions would be if you are a ""Yooper"" or a fan of Jeff Daniels, although I suppose if you liked ""Northern Exposure"" this one might appeal to you somewhat.  The story is set back in the fall of 1989, when Rueben had made it 43 years ""widdout baggin' a buck"" as they like to say up there and Deer Season had come around again.  Fortunately Rueben has on his side his wife, Wolf Moon Dance (Kimberly Norris Guerrero), who assures him that this will be his year and has followed the Ojibwe traditions in preparing him for the hunt.  Reuben's father Albert (Harve Presnell of ""Fargo"") serves as narrator when the film demands it, while Reuben's dopey brother Remnar (Joey Albright) chortles about Deer Season as being the equivalent of ""Christmas"" with guns.  Also joining them at the cabin is Jimmer Negamanee (Wayne David Parker), who was once abducted by aliens, and Ranger Bob (Randall Godwin) of the DNR, who stops by as well.  Now all Reuben has to do is not let his father and brother, the DNR, the space aliens, God, or the strange creature making noise out there in the woods stand in the way.I am surprised my brother-in-law Pete is not in this movie, because most of the people in the film sound like Pete does when he launches into one of his stories, although they tend to be more about Scandinavians than about hunting as a general rule.  ""Escanaba in da Moonlight"" is a nice little comedy without pretensions and an interesting use of a moose testicle.  I was actually fooled by it because I got to thinking that what was happening was really an elaborate practical joke constructed by Reuben to get back at his family, but it turns out I was on the wrong track, which is not what you want to be doing out in the woods with people carrying loaded guns.  My only real complaint is that while there is a documentary about the making of the film entitled ""A Picture From Home: The Journey Through 'Escanaba in da Moonlight,"" you will not find that here but rather on a separate DVD.  So if you really love the film, Jeff Daniels, and/or happen to live in Escanaba, you would be motivated to track that down, otherwise your experience will end here with the movie itself.",4,A buckless Jeff Daniels goes hunting with family and friends in this Yooper comedy,1155945600,"08 19, 2006",2006,3293,"['saw', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'concert', 'Big', 'Tent', 'Chautauqua', 'next', 'door', 'Wisconsin', 'singing', 'songs', 'playing', 'guitar', 'talked', 'having', 'made', 'movie', 'hunting', 'up', 'Upper', 'Peninsula', 'Michigan', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'movies', 'U.P', 'Anatomy', 'Murder', 'mind', 'decided', 'track', 'down', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'Escanaba', 'da', 'Moonlight', 'based', 'play', 'Daniel', 'wrote', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Theater', 'Chelsea', 'Michigan', 'Guy', 'Sanville', 'directed', 'play', 'helped', 'come', 'up', 'story', 'here', 'Daniels', 'screenplay', 'directing', 'chores', 'main', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'Rueben', 'Soady', 'who', 'shame', 'Soady', 'family', 'town', 'Escanaba', 'never', 'shot', 'buck', 'Reuben', 'buckless', 'not', 'mention', 'being', 'called', 'Bambi', 'best', 'friend', 'little', '2001', 'film', 'attempt', 'do', 'something', 'rectify', 'situation.So', 'basically', 'are', 'not', 'hunting', 'tall', 'tales', 'told', 'people', 'who', 'hunt', 'then', 'should', 'probably', 'pass', 'movie', 'exceptions', 'would', 'be', 'are', 'Yooper', 'fan', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'suppose', 'liked', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'one', 'might', 'appeal', 'somewhat', 'story', 'set', 'back', 'fall', '1989', 'when', 'Rueben', 'had', 'made', '43', 'years', 'baggin', 'buck', 'like', 'say', 'there', 'Deer', 'Season', 'had', 'come', 'around', 'again', 'Fortunately', 'Rueben', 'side', 'wife', 'Wolf', 'Moon', 'Dance', 'Kimberly', 'Norris', 'Guerrero', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'year', 'followed', 'Ojibwe', 'traditions', 'preparing', 'hunt', 'Reuben', 'father', 'Albert', 'Harve', 'Presnell', 'Fargo', 'narrator', 'when', 'film', 'Reuben', 'dopey', 'brother', 'Remnar', 'Joey', 'Albright', 'Deer', 'Season', 'being', 'equivalent', 'Christmas', 'guns', 'Also', 'joining', 'cabin', 'Jimmer', 'Negamanee', 'Wayne', 'David', 'Parker', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'Ranger', 'Bob', 'Randall', 'Godwin', 'DNR', 'who', 'as', 'well', 'Now', 'Reuben', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'father', 'brother', 'DNR', 'space', 'God', 'strange', 'creature', 'making', 'noise', 'there', 'woods', 'stand', 'way.I', 'am', 'surprised', 'brother-in-law', 'Pete', 'not', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'film', 'sound', 'Pete', 'when', 'one', 'stories', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'Scandinavians', 'about', 'hunting', 'general', 'rule', 'Escanaba', 'da', 'Moonlight', 'nice', 'little', 'comedy', 'pretensions', 'interesting', 'use', 'moose', 'testicle', 'was', 'actually', 'fooled', 'got', 'thinking', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'was', 'really', 'elaborate', 'practical', 'joke', 'constructed', 'Reuben', 'get', 'back', 'family', 'out', 'was', 'wrong', 'track', 'not', 'what', 'want', 'be', 'doing', 'out', 'woods', 'people', 'carrying', 'loaded', 'guns', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'entitled', 'Picture', 'From', 'Home', 'Journey', 'Through', ""'Escanaba"", 'da', 'Moonlight', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'here', 'rather', 'separate', 'DVD', 'So', 'really', 'love', 'film', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'and/or', 'happen', 'live', 'Escanaba', 'would', 'be', 'motivated', 'track', 'down', 'otherwise', 'experience', 'will', 'end', 'here', 'movie']",Escanaba in Da Moonlight

The humor is: slapstick, ironic, cultural, musical, and visual in nature. I usually enjoy British comedy, but Jeff Daniels wrote a real gem, here. The characters are coarse and ignorant, but loveable. The actors were cast perfectly--their body types, voices, and mannerisms perfect for their roles. The entire story takes place in a backwoods cabin, in Northern Michigan, where an unlucky man (accompanied by his firm father, crude brother, and an eccentric and unintelligable friend)has retreated, trying to break his bad luck, by hunting down a deer, and bringing it home to his Chippewa wife. The events in that little wood lodge take on supernatural proportions, when a Chevy catches on fire, and tries to run down a man who believes he was once visited by aliens, when the four of them drink sacred Native American potions for health that include such ingredients as baked worms, and when a mysterious creature is believed to be after them all, and must be warded off with... well, you have to see it. I especially like the scene in which the skinny sherrif has been stripped down to his underwear, and is tied to a chair, singing ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"" while being splashed with pungent liquid. Ghosts, visions, homemade moonshine, strange lights, unusual cuisine, unique characters, bizarre humor, delightful local slang, and excellent timing abound in this movie. Its a family movie, for the theatre-lover and the basic middle American alike. 5 stars! (Note, I am a vegetarian who is, shall we say, anti-hunting, but that did not impact my enjoyment of the film.

And while the humor will especially hit home for residents of Michigan's Upper Peninsula (The Superior state, as they call it), and those living in other &quot;deer country&quot; states such as Wisconsin and Minnesota, this movie has plenty of laughs for everyone.Centering on the Soady family on their annual cabin trip the first day of deer season, the film explores the trials and tribulations of the &quot;buckless yupper,&quot; Reuben Soady, (Jeff Daniels).Now, fair warning, this movie gets pretty bizarre. Among the occurrences the Soady family has on its day of hunting are UFO's, a government agent gone mental, possession and Native American superstitions.But all the insanity leads to big laughs. And it doesn't let up until near the end, where the only flaw lies. The film crosses the line of becoming too sentimental, offering too much cheese.

715999,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B00006HAX7,stoic,"[0, 1]","Escanaba in Da Moonlight is a comedy about a man named Rueben Soady (Jeff Daniels) who lives on Michigan's rugged Upper Peninsula (the U.P.). Soady is ashamed because he is in his forties, but he has yet to shoot his first deer. Soady vows to change things and hijinks ensue.There are some nice things about this film. The cast is good. I particularly like the three actors portraying the Soady clan; in addition to Rueben, viewers meet father Albert (Harve Presnall) and brother Remnar (Joey Albright). The film also has some beautiful visuals from the Upper Peninsula; I read online that this was the first movie filmed in the U.P. since 1959's Anatomy of a Murder.For me, Escanaba in Da Moonlight misses the mark. One big problem is that the script relies on annoying slapstick humor. [...] If you like Chevy Chase, Jim Carrey, and that Hey Vern guy, you're going to love this film. Another problem is that the plot starts well, but quickly derails. Once the hunters arrive at their cabin (about one-third of the way through the film), it's all downhill. It's just one stupid scene after another with a tacked-on, sappy ending that does not fit the zany mood that the filmmakers established beforehand.Judging from the reviews, Escanaba in Da Moonlight has a lot of fans.
