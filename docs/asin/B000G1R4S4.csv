I like how the writers have managed to expand on whats classically seen as background characters (and introduced new ones) but the script was pretty weak for dialouge, almost like you can tell they are reading off script prompters at some points! However, there were some golden points, dont get me wrong. I just found them outshined by the amount of crap involved. But then again, this might just be me being jaded.Worth it if you are into the mindless drabble or teen dramas. Good in the large scheme of the overral story.Did anyone notice the price hike on amazon for these five seasons? I think I bought it off here several months back for $150 (US)?

But I can't say I understand where these people are coming from.  There have been many different incarnations of Superman over the decades and they all exist in their own little continuity.  Each should be looked at on it's own rather than how it follows rules of predefined events in other incarnations of the character.On it's own, Smallville is a fine TV show, and by far the best thing they could do to tell the story of a young Clark Kent.  Tom Welling is perfect as the series star, and Michael Rosenbaum is just as superbly cast as his best friend/one day nemesis Lex Luthor.  The rest of the cast is filled quite nicely as well, with believable actors taking up the familiar roles as well as some all new characters.If you look at this show for it's own qualities rather than how it stands up to some image of what Superman should be, you will very likely enjoy every moment of this series.",5,A highly enjoyable new spin on the Superman legend!,1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,1001,"['know', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'bash', 'show', 'liberties', 'Superman', 'history', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'understand', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'coming', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'different', 'incarnations', 'Superman', 'decades', 'exist', 'own', 'little', 'continuity', 'should', 'be', 'looked', 'own', 'rather', 'how', 'rules', 'predefined', 'events', 'other', 'incarnations', 'character.On', 'own', 'Smallville', 'fine', 'TV', 'show', 'far', 'best', 'thing', 'could', 'do', 'tell', 'story', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'perfect', 'series', 'star', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'just', 'superbly', 'cast', 'best', 'friend/one', 'day', 'nemesis', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'rest', 'cast', 'filled', 'quite', 'nicely', 'as', 'well', 'believable', 'actors', 'taking', 'up', 'familiar', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'characters.If', 'look', 'show', 'own', 'qualities', 'rather', 'how', 'up', 'image', 'what', 'Superman', 'should', 'be', 'will', 'very', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'moment', 'series']",N/A

Only because I had a false sense that it was leading up to something extraodinary. I was wrong. It had some good episodes but in only Half of all seasons!! Come on. The writers really need to get a clue. Although the actors' skills have definately progressed overtime,they turned the show from a potential mini-superhero-action series into a 'I love Lana,I need Lana, I can't live without Lana,' mama drama show!! Clarke only flies when Jor-El takes over his body, when he has that retarded red ring, and when the phantom clones his body (Season Six). They save all the real action and important stuff for the season finales which I feel are always great. But a whole season of nonsense and a great finale is not what I call a good show. I give it two stars for the show itself and I give it another star for the writers successfully managing to make me believe that if I watch the series long enough something great will eventually happen in between that I wouldn't want to miss, good job. Bottom line: 1)Show needs action. Clarke needs to throw more than a punch in a fight. 2) Get rid of Lana, which they seemingly did at the end of Season Six 3)Better stories with better villains. I do like Lex however, but get rid of annoying Lionel.

Burgos ""J.D.""","[2, 40]","However since I already own the 4 seasons relased, it is quite pointless to buy the whole pack and double up on the same quality of episodes that you already have. Here's an advice from me. If you are willing to buy this, you should if you don't have any of the seasons yet. Another thing if you can buy this DVD set, either one of the discs in the sets have been damaged or missing. Finally if any of the sets are dismantled, get another one and sell the dismantled sets for qual or lesser value. But yeah, I would own Smallville season 5 basicially because Tom Welling and Kristin Kreuk look exactly like my local TV husband and wife anchors Drew and Nerissa Sugars from CBS affiliate KCOY-TV that's why they are known as Clark and Lana on KCOY-TV CBS 12 Santa Maria, CA.
