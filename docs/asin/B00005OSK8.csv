672885,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005OSK8,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Losing a loved one can stir in us emotions we are not willing, or maybe not even mentally capable, to accept.  This is the case when Marie's husband Jean goes missing.  The middle-aged couple begins their vacation with tragedy when Jean heads off for a swim, never to return.  Instead of facing her dire situation head on, Marie masks her questions and nagging emotional turmoil with the faux belief that Jean is still very much a part of her life.This cannot end well.The beauty of `Sous le Sable' can be found in the astonishing performance given by Charlotte Rampling.  Her brutally honest (there is nothing brutal about this performance in the theatrical and dramatic definition of the word) depiction of a soul trying to establish normalcy is so heartbreaking yet so lived in that you swear she is a real woman suffering from a real condition.You break into pieces for her.As her word is crumbling around her, Marie refuses to entertain the notion that her husband has left her, and with the lack of a body it appears that the only logical conclusion is that Jean is still with her, living out his days with the woman he swore to love eternally.  Her friends and family are appalled with her reaction to Jean's disappearance.  They want her to move on, but they are ignorant to the fact that moving on would only make matters worse for someone in her emotional condition.  Jean represents a part of her life that made sense, that made her happy, and letting go of that memory would only thrust Marie into the pain her mind is not ready to handle.I don't think enough words can be said to express how marvelous Charlotte Rampling really is here.  I hate the fact that this film was released in 2001, namely because the performances in this particular category were so far and beyond perfection that I cannot give Rampling a win (Naomi Watts and Renee Zellweger struggle enough to dethrone the other on any given day).  But, when it comes to performances that define this decade, Rampling is certainly in the top ten!There is a quiet misery that permeates each scene, but it is in her serene moments of contentment (that ravishing love scene for one...the hands...OMG) that really make this performance UNFORGETTABLE.This film may move too slowly for some, and some may not fully appreciate the message that writer/director Francois Ozon is effortlessly weaving, but if you take the time needed to allow yourself to become one with this film you will find something that will move you in ways most unexpected.If you've ever lost someone, whether in death or in other ways (end of a relationship, friendship, etc.) and the loss was so sudden you found yourself blindly covering over your own knowledge in order to remain seemingly sane then this movie will touch you in the most intimate of ways.",5,Self created closure...,1262563200,"01 4, 2010",2010,2798,"['Losing', 'loved', 'one', 'can', 'stir', 'emotions', 'are', 'not', 'willing', 'maybe', 'not', 'even', 'mentally', 'capable', 'accept', 'case', 'when', 'Marie', 'husband', 'Jean', 'missing', 'middle-aged', 'couple', 'vacation', 'tragedy', 'when', 'Jean', 'off', 'swim', 'never', 'return', 'Instead', 'facing', 'dire', 'situation', 'head', 'Marie', 'questions', 'nagging', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'faux', 'belief', 'Jean', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'life.This', 'can', 'not', 'end', 'well.The', 'beauty', 'Sous', 'le', 'Sable', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'given', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'brutally', 'honest', 'nothing', 'brutal', 'performance', 'theatrical', 'dramatic', 'definition', 'word', 'depiction', 'soul', 'trying', 'establish', 'normalcy', 'so', 'heartbreaking', 'yet', 'so', 'lived', 'swear', 'real', 'woman', 'suffering', 'real', 'condition.You', 'break', 'pieces', 'her.As', 'word', 'crumbling', 'Marie', 'entertain', 'notion', 'husband', 'left', 'lack', 'body', 'only', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'Jean', 'still', 'living', 'out', 'days', 'woman', 'swore', 'love', 'eternally', 'friends', 'family', 'are', 'appalled', 'reaction', 'Jean', 'disappearance', 'want', 'move', 'are', 'ignorant', 'fact', 'moving', 'would', 'only', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'someone', 'emotional', 'condition', 'Jean', 'part', 'life', 'made', 'sense', 'made', 'happy', 'letting', 'go', 'memory', 'would', 'only', 'thrust', 'Marie', 'pain', 'mind', 'not', 'ready', 'handle.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'enough', 'words', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'express', 'how', 'marvelous', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'really', 'here', 'hate', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'released', '2001', 'namely', 'performances', 'particular', 'category', 'were', 'so', 'far', 'perfection', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'Rampling', 'win', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'struggle', 'enough', 'dethrone', 'other', 'given', 'day', 'when', 'performances', 'define', 'decade', 'Rampling', 'certainly', 'top', 'ten', 'quiet', 'misery', 'scene', 'serene', 'moments', 'contentment', 'ravishing', 'love', 'scene', 'one', 'hands', 'OMG', 'really', 'make', 'performance', 'UNFORGETTABLE.This', 'film', 'may', 'move', 'too', 'slowly', 'may', 'not', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'message', 'writer/director', 'Francois', 'Ozon', 'effortlessly', 'weaving', 'take', 'time', 'needed', 'allow', 'become', 'one', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'will', 'move', 'ways', 'most', 'unexpected.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'lost', 'someone', 'death', 'other', 'ways', 'end', 'relationship', 'friendship', 'etc', 'loss', 'was', 'so', 'sudden', 'found', 'blindly', 'covering', 'own', 'knowledge', 'order', 'remain', 'seemingly', 'sane', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'touch', 'most', 'intimate', 'ways']",Under the Sand

672891,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005OSK8,Grady Harp,"[16, 16]","Franois Ozon is a rare director, one who takes a simple story, places it in the eyes and bodies of his cast, and simply lets the tale tell itself.  SOUS LE SABLE (UNDER THE SAND) is an unforgettable film experience that probes deeply into our psyches, hearts, and reason: how do we cope with sudden death?Opening quietly in the French countryside, a loving middle-aged couple begins a brief vacation in a family house, quietly and lovingly going about removing dustcovers, opening shuttered windows - settling in for a time of being alone together.  Marie (Charlotte Rampling) is a professor of English in Paris (her specialty is Virginia Woolf) and Jean (Bruno Cremer) is her retired husband.  Their long-term love is palpable: Ozon provides almost no dialogue, as none is needed to establish this special relationship, so powerful is the non-verbal communication between Rampling and Cremer. They visit the beach the next day and while Marie is sunbathing, Jean goes for a swim - and never returns.  Marie searches for him, engages lifeguards, and ultimately returns to Paris, trembling but intact.  Months later, while Jean is never found, we see Marie reacting as though he still exists.  She visualizes him in various situations and the two actors (yes, Jean is present in these scenes) interact as though nothing has changed.  But Marie's friends note with great concern that she is 'delusional' and make various attempts for her to seek professional and emotional help.  When news eventually arrives that Jean's body has been found, she internally denies this possibility but eventually returns to the vacation house town to identify the bloated corpse. Even at this point, though obviously in shock, she denies that the corpse is that of her beloved Jean.  She walks back to the site where she last saw Jean and in the distance a figure rekindles her hope...Charlotte Rampling delivers a performance wholly committed.  She communicates the spectrum of feelings of this challenged strong woman with her eyes, her gazes in the mirror, her interaction with her class of students, her friends, her admirer with such power that makes her Marie a wholly credible creature stricken by loss yet surviving in her chosen manner.  It is one of the great performances of cinema. The entire small cast of this film is perfection. Ozon is a magical director and continues to prove he is one of the most honest and quietly powerful figures in today's cinema.  Highly recommended.

However, when someone loses a beloved and the body of the loved one is not recovered there will never be true closure, which will leave the bereaved in somber doubt.  Thus, the perceptual concept, seeing is believing, is one of the fundamental keys to the story's melancholic atmosphere as the main character, Marie Drillon (Charlotte Rampling), drifts into a ghostlike world.Under the Sand begins with Marie returning to south France with her husband Jean (Bruno Cremer) to their summer house where they spend every summer.  It is a vacation that they both look forward to as they can get away from the hectic city life.  The Drillon's keep a thoughtful silence between them as they go through the daily chores, which is only broken sporadically.  Apparently both enjoy silent contemplation and solitude, yet they harbor each others company with warmth and nurturing love.The loving relationship between Marie and Jean takes a sudden turn as Marie wakes up from an afternoon nap under the Mediterranean sun.  Bewildered where her husband is she begins to search for him along the beach where he went swimming.  Panic begins to crawl upon her as she fears the worst as the coast guard cannot recover him.Months later Marie has returned to her daily routine in the city where she lives and works.  Marie's friends attempt to find someone to woo her, but she continues as if Jean is still alive.  Marie buys her missing husband ties, talks to him before she goes to bed, and hugs him good night.  In essence, it seems like Marie uses an avoidance strategy to deal with the loss that drives her into a delusional state where she sees and believes that he is not gone.Underneath the surface of what is depicted there are several issues that could have caused Marie to drift into a delusion due to why her husband disappeared.  It could be the moments when Marie and Jean sat in silence and never expressed their possible true thoughts, it could be a secret that Jean had, and he could have been simply bored with her and left.  However, she will never find out as he never left her a note or a message of what he did. Instead she is left in a cerebral no man's land where she question why, and if she had anything to do with his disappearance.Franois Ozon's Under the Sand is an intelligent depiction of grief, loss, and the process of dealing with a lost one that never is recovered.  Ozon based the film on an event that took place by the ocean during his childhood.  In addition, Ozon researched grief and loss by interviewing psychologists and specialists in the field of grief and mourning, which is evident in the depth of the character's persona.  The film simply relies on Charlotte Rampling's performance, which is brilliant as it becomes an intricate character study of a characters grief and loss.Under the Sand offers a wonderful cinematic experience, which is enhanced by Rampling's marvelous performance.  It is also Ozon's cinematic touch of minimalism that brings more to the screen than what is uttered.  This forces the viewers to dwell on what is illustrated on the screen as the silence influences the power of the image.  Ultimately, the film reinforces the notion that ""seeing is believing"" as the audience cannot see and does not know what to believe.",5,Brilliantly Sublime Character Study in Grief and Loss...,1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,3409,"['loss', 'loved', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'overwhelming', 'when', 'grief', 'sets', 'closure', 'brought', 'mourner', 'customary', 'funeral', 'services', 'However', 'when', 'someone', 'beloved', 'body', 'loved', 'one', 'not', 'recovered', 'there', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'true', 'closure', 'will', 'leave', 'bereaved', 'somber', 'doubt', 'Thus', 'perceptual', 'concept', 'seeing', 'believing', 'one', 'fundamental', 'keys', 'story', 'melancholic', 'atmosphere', 'main', 'character', 'Marie', 'Drillon', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'ghostlike', 'world.Under', 'Sand', 'Marie', 'returning', 'south', 'France', 'husband', 'Jean', 'Bruno', 'Cremer', 'summer', 'house', 'where', 'spend', 'summer', 'vacation', 'look', 'forward', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'hectic', 'city', 'life', 'Drillon', 'keep', 'thoughtful', 'silence', 'go', 'daily', 'chores', 'only', 'broken', 'sporadically', 'Apparently', 'enjoy', 'silent', 'contemplation', 'solitude', 'yet', 'harbor', 'others', 'company', 'warmth', 'nurturing', 'love.The', 'loving', 'relationship', 'Marie', 'Jean', 'sudden', 'turn', 'Marie', 'up', 'afternoon', 'nap', 'Mediterranean', 'sun', 'Bewildered', 'where', 'husband', 'search', 'beach', 'where', 'went', 'swimming', 'Panic', 'begins', 'crawl', 'upon', 'worst', 'coast', 'guard', 'can', 'not', 'recover', 'him.Months', 'later', 'Marie', 'returned', 'daily', 'routine', 'city', 'where', 'Marie', 'friends', 'attempt', 'find', 'someone', 'woo', 'Jean', 'still', 'alive', 'Marie', 'missing', 'husband', 'ties', 'talks', 'bed', 'hugs', 'good', 'night', 'essence', 'Marie', 'avoidance', 'strategy', 'deal', 'loss', 'delusional', 'state', 'where', 'not', 'gone.Underneath', 'surface', 'what', 'depicted', 'are', 'several', 'issues', 'could', 'have', 'caused', 'Marie', 'drift', 'delusion', 'due', 'why', 'husband', 'disappeared', 'could', 'be', 'moments', 'when', 'Marie', 'Jean', 'sat', 'silence', 'never', 'expressed', 'possible', 'true', 'thoughts', 'could', 'be', 'secret', 'Jean', 'had', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'simply', 'bored', 'left', 'However', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'never', 'left', 'note', 'message', 'what', 'did', 'Instead', 'left', 'cerebral', 'man', 'land', 'where', 'question', 'why', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'disappearance.Franois', 'Ozon', 'Sand', 'intelligent', 'depiction', 'grief', 'loss', 'process', 'dealing', 'lost', 'one', 'never', 'recovered', 'Ozon', 'based', 'film', 'event', 'took', 'place', 'ocean', 'childhood', 'addition', 'Ozon', 'researched', 'grief', 'loss', 'interviewing', 'psychologists', 'specialists', 'field', 'grief', 'mourning', 'evident', 'depth', 'character', 'persona', 'film', 'simply', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'intricate', 'character', 'study', 'characters', 'grief', 'loss.Under', 'Sand', 'wonderful', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'enhanced', 'Rampling', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'also', 'Ozon', 'cinematic', 'touch', 'minimalism', 'more', 'screen', 'what', 'uttered', 'viewers', 'dwell', 'what', 'illustrated', 'screen', 'silence', 'power', 'image', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'notion', 'seeing', 'believing', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'believe']",Under the Sand
672894,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00005OSK8,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[14, 15]","A brilliant companion piece to Swimming Pool, Francois Ozon's Under the Sand similarly casts Charlotte Rampling as the lead female, here in a tale of loss.  Interestingly, in both films, she has a position of someone not only literate but directly involved in literature.  In Swimming Pool, she is a writer; here, she is an instructor of literature.This is key to understanding how subtle Ozon is in these two masterful films.  Parallel in both works is the fusing of fantasy and reality.  In Under the Sand, Marie's (Rampling) husband disappears and her fantasy life--reinforced, it is implied, by her profession--blossoms into imagining her husband still with her, long after his disappearance, and, as well, feeling hands stroking all parts of her body in one amazing scene.  More subtly, Ozon here, as in Swimming Pool, uses the mix of French and English--both language and culture--to emphasize the blurring of fantasy and reality.  When Marie's best friend--like her, another bilingual English woman married to a French man--speaks to her, it is sometimes in French, sometimes in English, indicating the fluidity of thought and feeling between two modes of existence.  Marie's friend sympathizes with her loss--French--but wants her to face up to the reality of what has happened and continue with her life--English.Similarly, Marie's new lover tells her that he thinks of the English as morbid.  But he is French and tells her this in French; it shows, Ozon says, that there is a desire in the French to feel deeply, contrasted with the English who desire to think deeply.  Such is the implication here.  Marie IS French, though born English, and it is just this fusing of the two cultures within herself that results in her confusion of fantasy and reality.However, it would be too easy to equate French with fantasy and English with reality; Ozon does not really do this as simplistically as the above seems to indicate.  Instead, he does imply this in several scenes, but as well shows us Marie telling her friend, in English, that Jean (her lost husband) is taking a nap or out for a walk when he has not been with her for a year or so. That is, Marie herself is not able to distinguish the difference in the two cultures flowing in her blood--not able to differentiate as simply as all that the difference between fantasy and reality, between thought and feeling.  This is brought to a head in the great ending sequence, not revealed here, in which Jean is, perhaps, not lost after all.  Or is he?Ozon is a superbly intelligent filmmaker who closely investigates what and how we think and feel, delicately exposing the nuances of behavior and how they determine who we really are. The subtlety shown in his work is truly astonishing and marks him as one of the great French directors working today.",5,"Two cultures, two modes of existence",1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,2810,"['brilliant', 'companion', 'piece', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'Francois', 'Ozon', 'Sand', 'similarly', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'lead', 'female', 'here', 'tale', 'loss', 'Interestingly', 'films', 'position', 'someone', 'not', 'only', 'literate', 'directly', 'involved', 'literature', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'writer', 'here', 'instructor', 'literature.This', 'key', 'understanding', 'how', 'subtle', 'Ozon', 'two', 'masterful', 'films', 'Parallel', 'works', 'fusing', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'Sand', 'Marie', 'Rampling', 'husband', 'disappears', 'fantasy', 'life', 'reinforced', 'implied', 'profession', 'blossoms', 'imagining', 'husband', 'still', 'long', 'disappearance', 'as', 'well', 'feeling', 'hands', 'stroking', 'parts', 'body', 'one', 'amazing', 'scene', 'More', 'subtly', 'Ozon', 'here', 'Swimming', 'Pool', 'mix', 'French', 'English', 'language', 'culture', 'emphasize', 'blurring', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'When', 'Marie', 'best', 'friend', 'bilingual', 'English', 'woman', 'married', 'French', 'man', 'sometimes', 'French', 'sometimes', 'English', 'indicating', 'fluidity', 'thought', 'feeling', 'two', 'modes', 'existence', 'Marie', 'friend', 'loss', 'French', 'face', 'up', 'reality', 'what', 'happened', 'continue', 'life', 'English.Similarly', 'Marie', 'new', 'lover', 'English', 'morbid', 'French', 'French', 'Ozon', 'desire', 'French', 'feel', 'deeply', 'contrasted', 'English', 'who', 'desire', 'think', 'deeply', 'Such', 'implication', 'here', 'Marie', 'IS', 'French', 'born', 'English', 'just', 'fusing', 'two', 'cultures', 'results', 'confusion', 'fantasy', 'reality.However', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'easy', 'equate', 'French', 'fantasy', 'English', 'reality', 'Ozon', 'not', 'really', 'do', 'as', 'simplistically', 'above', 'indicate', 'Instead', 'imply', 'several', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'Marie', 'telling', 'friend', 'English', 'Jean', 'lost', 'husband', 'taking', 'nap', 'walk', 'when', 'not', 'been', 'year', 'so', 'Marie', 'not', 'able', 'distinguish', 'difference', 'two', 'cultures', 'flowing', 'blood', 'not', 'able', 'differentiate', 'as', 'simply', 'difference', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'thought', 'feeling', 'brought', 'head', 'great', 'ending', 'sequence', 'not', 'revealed', 'here', 'Jean', 'perhaps', 'not', 'lost', 'Ozon', 'superbly', 'intelligent', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'closely', 'what', 'how', 'think', 'feel', 'delicately', 'exposing', 'nuances', 'behavior', 'how', 'determine', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'subtlety', 'shown', 'work', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'one', 'great', 'French', 'directors', 'working', 'today']",Under the Sand

Charlotte Rampling does a good job interpreting the lead character and the settings are wonderfully shot.It is a film about loss and how at times we cope with it unrealistically.

When I looked at her career and the movies in her filmography, I was surprised to see that such a fine actress really hasn't been in that many good movies.  Not a young woman anymore, Ms Rampling is still very alluring.  This film has a few erotic moments, but not to the degree that some reviewers are stating.

672897,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005OSK8,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","Francis Ozon, then 33-year-old French male, directed this film starring English muse Charlotte Rampling whose debut goes back in 'Knack,' in 1965.  It's an incredible combination, but more incredible is the fact that 'Under the Sand' handles the sexuality of women so beautifully and honestly.The story, which is based on Ozon's own childhood memory, starts with a married couple Marie (Rampling) and Jean (Bruno Cremer).  As soon you know, they have been husband and wife for a long time, their relations being a happy one.  From Paris where they live, they come to a small seaside resort where they own a cottage, and are going to spend some quiet time there.But something happens.  While sleeping on the sand, Marie realizes Jean is missing, and can see no trace of what happened to him.  Gradually becoming desperate, Marie askes for the rescue team of the town, but not a thing can be found that indicates his whereabout.The film then centers Marie teaching Virgina Wolfe in Paris.  The life goes on, but she find it hard to see and accept the reality, in spite of a new male friend coming to her room.  She still feels Jean's presence, his voice, and his body, and 'Under the Sand' tenderly but unflinchingly follows the journey of Marie, who must eventually see the truths about her love.This is not a suspense film (though the truths behind the missing Jean is tantalizingly revealed); it's about the woman Marie, and her strong responce refusing to see the unavoidable truths about the people near her.  Also the film successfully deals with the delicate matter of sexuality of middle-aged women openly.  One of the scenes includes the nudity of Rampling herself (no body double), but that is not gratuitous, thanks to the deft direction of Ozon, and most of all, Rampling, born in 1946, is still so beautiful.'Under the Sand' is about this woman Marie, or Charlotte Rampling herself, always mature, intelligent, and seductive.  In a sense, this is better than Ozon's later works like more famous 'Swimming Pool' in presenting more substantial character.If you like Charlotte Rampling, try to find her guest appearance in one episode 'The Superlative Seven' in British cult TV series 'Agengers '67.'  She played, most unbelieblavly, a gunslinger.",5,Missing: Beautiful Charlotte Rampling's Portrayal of a Woman,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,2255,"['Francis', 'Ozon', 'then', '33-year-old', 'French', 'male', 'directed', 'film', 'starring', 'English', 'muse', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'debut', 'back', ""'Knack"", '1965', 'incredible', 'combination', 'more', 'incredible', 'fact', 'Sand', 'sexuality', 'women', 'so', 'beautifully', 'honestly.The', 'story', 'based', 'Ozon', 'own', 'childhood', 'memory', 'married', 'couple', 'Marie', 'Rampling', 'Jean', 'Bruno', 'Cremer', 'soon', 'know', 'have', 'been', 'husband', 'wife', 'long', 'time', 'relations', 'being', 'happy', 'one', 'Paris', 'where', 'live', 'come', 'small', 'seaside', 'resort', 'where', 'own', 'cottage', 'are', 'going', 'spend', 'quiet', 'time', 'there.But', 'something', 'happens', 'sleeping', 'sand', 'Marie', 'Jean', 'missing', 'can', 'see', 'trace', 'what', 'happened', 'Gradually', 'becoming', 'desperate', 'Marie', 'rescue', 'team', 'town', 'not', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'whereabout.The', 'film', 'then', 'centers', 'Marie', 'teaching', 'Virgina', 'Wolfe', 'Paris', 'life', 'find', 'hard', 'see', 'accept', 'reality', 'spite', 'new', 'male', 'friend', 'coming', 'room', 'still', 'Jean', 'presence', 'voice', 'body', ""'Under"", 'Sand', 'tenderly', 'unflinchingly', 'journey', 'Marie', 'who', 'must', 'eventually', 'see', 'truths', 'love.This', 'not', 'suspense', 'film', 'truths', 'missing', 'Jean', 'tantalizingly', 'revealed', 'woman', 'Marie', 'strong', 'responce', 'refusing', 'see', 'unavoidable', 'truths', 'people', 'Also', 'film', 'successfully', 'delicate', 'matter', 'sexuality', 'middle-aged', 'women', 'openly', 'One', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'Rampling', 'body', 'double', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'thanks', 'deft', 'direction', 'Ozon', 'most', 'Rampling', 'born', '1946', 'still', 'so', 'beautiful', ""'Under"", 'Sand', 'woman', 'Marie', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'always', 'mature', 'intelligent', 'seductive', 'sense', 'better', 'Ozon', 'later', 'more', 'famous', ""'Swimming"", 'Pool', 'presenting', 'more', 'substantial', 'character.If', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'try', 'find', 'guest', 'appearance', 'one', 'episode', 'Superlative', 'Seven', 'British', 'cult', 'TV', 'series', ""'Agengers"", 'played', 'most', 'unbelieblavly', 'gunslinger']",Under the Sand
