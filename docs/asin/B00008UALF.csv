Holden, Widmark) and the worst (Vin Diesel). However this cute drama/comedy caper is cute at best and not worth his talents. If not for the three leads (Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman, and Matthew Broderick) who are involved, this film would be forgetable.Connery plays Jesse, the elder stateman of the McMullin clan who is part irish/part scot. Jesse is also a career criminal who has been out and in of jails. His son Vito (Hoffman) (part scot irish and Italian)was raised in the life of burglary and is trying to go straight with his meat packing business. Vito's son adam (Broderick)  (who is part scot/irish/italian and Jewish on his mother's side) was gifted with a silver spoon in his mouth. Adam  rather join the family business and be a thief like his Grandfather Jesse. The family dynamic works well with these three leads together, it breaks apart with they do not play scenes like a trioNone of the actors are the weakest link in this film, it lays in the script itself. Lumet uses too many two long shots and two shots to make sure at least two of the trio is always together.The talent is on the DVD. One could wish one of these films giants  or Lumet would have done an audio commentary, but none have come to pass.So steal this DVD for your collectionBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",4,With a Family like this...,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1366,"['Sidney', 'Lumet', 'directed', 'best', 'actor', 'Fonda', 'Connery', 'Pacino', 'Holden', 'Widmark', 'worst', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'However', 'cute', 'drama/comedy', 'caper', 'cute', 'best', 'not', 'worth', 'talents', 'not', 'three', 'leads', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'who', 'are', 'involved', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'forgetable.Connery', 'plays', 'Jesse', 'elder', 'stateman', 'McMullin', 'clan', 'who', 'part', 'irish/part', 'scot', 'Jesse', 'also', 'career', 'criminal', 'who', 'been', 'out', 'jails', 'son', 'Vito', 'Hoffman', 'part', 'irish', 'Italian', 'was', 'raised', 'life', 'burglary', 'trying', 'go', 'straight', 'meat', 'packing', 'business', 'Vito', 'son', 'adam', 'Broderick', 'who', 'part', 'scot/irish/italian', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'side', 'was', 'gifted', 'silver', 'spoon', 'mouth', 'Adam', 'rather', 'join', 'family', 'business', 'be', 'thief', 'Grandfather', 'Jesse', 'family', 'works', 'well', 'three', 'leads', 'together', 'apart', 'do', 'not', 'play', 'scenes', 'trioNone', 'actors', 'are', 'weakest', 'link', 'film', 'script', 'Lumet', 'too', 'many', 'two', 'long', 'shots', 'two', 'shots', 'make', 'sure', 'least', 'two', 'trio', 'always', 'together.The', 'talent', 'DVD', 'One', 'could', 'wish', 'one', 'films', 'giants', 'Lumet', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'audio', 'commentary', 'none', 'have', 'come', 'pass.So', 'steal', 'DVD', 'collectionBennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLD']",Family Business
747394,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00008UALF,Charles Ashbacher,"[1, 3]","Given the star power of Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick, one expects a dynamic film with tense moments leading to captivating scenes. Unfortunately, none of the three main characters elicits a great deal of empathy, at times it is as if they are just going through the action in order to get it over with.Matthew Broderick plays Adam, a very successful scholar at MIT that is bored and wants to demonstrate that he can also succeed at the family business, which is crime. He dreams up what he believes is the perfect crime and he enlists the aid of his father Vito (Dustin Hoffman) and his grandfather Jesse (Sean Connery). Both of these men have done time in prison, Vito now owns and operates a successful meat business while Jesse is still a scoundrel.While Jesse loves the idea of the three of them bonding over the crime, Vito is adamantly opposed. However, when Adam says he is doing it no matter what his father says, Vito agrees to complete the threesome. Predictably, the armed burglary goes wrong and Adam is arrested on site. At this point, Vito must decide if his love for his son is greater than his instinct for self-preservation and his loyalty to his father.While Sean Connery should be good at playing a lovable scoundrel, in this movie the lovable is lacking. His entire mindset is that of getting the emotional rush from committing a crime with little regard for the consequences to his offspring. The plot device of someone as successful as Adam risking it all for a crime is implausible and the completely self-centered nature of Jesse turned me off.  I found the movie descending into boring at several points.",2,It just did not work for me,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,1651,"['Given', 'star', 'power', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'one', 'dynamic', 'film', 'tense', 'moments', 'leading', 'captivating', 'scenes', 'Unfortunately', 'none', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'great', 'deal', 'empathy', 'times', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'action', 'order', 'get', 'over', 'with.Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Adam', 'very', 'successful', 'scholar', 'MIT', 'bored', 'demonstrate', 'can', 'also', 'succeed', 'family', 'business', 'crime', 'up', 'what', 'perfect', 'crime', 'aid', 'father', 'Vito', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'grandfather', 'Jesse', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'men', 'have', 'done', 'time', 'prison', 'Vito', 'now', 'successful', 'meat', 'business', 'Jesse', 'still', 'scoundrel.While', 'Jesse', 'idea', 'three', 'bonding', 'crime', 'Vito', 'adamantly', 'opposed', 'However', 'when', 'Adam', 'doing', 'matter', 'what', 'father', 'Vito', 'complete', 'threesome', 'Predictably', 'armed', 'burglary', 'wrong', 'Adam', 'arrested', 'site', 'point', 'Vito', 'must', 'decide', 'love', 'son', 'greater', 'instinct', 'self-preservation', 'loyalty', 'father.While', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'playing', 'lovable', 'scoundrel', 'movie', 'lovable', 'lacking', 'entire', 'mindset', 'getting', 'emotional', 'rush', 'committing', 'crime', 'little', 'regard', 'consequences', 'offspring', 'plot', 'device', 'someone', 'as', 'successful', 'Adam', 'risking', 'crime', 'implausible', 'completely', 'self-centered', 'nature', 'Jesse', 'turned', 'off', 'found', 'movie', 'descending', 'boring', 'several', 'points']",Family Business
