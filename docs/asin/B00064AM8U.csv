The bonus CD in particular has several tracks that are truly lousy - maybe it was mixed differently so it sounds worse than the DVD.Josh mentions that he is just finishing a tour. Presumably he is tired and possibly also sick, as he sounds nasal and hoarse.  He also looks nervous -- don't know if it's because he knows his voice is off, or because he knows this is for recording.  He does warm up during the performance, in response to an enthusiastic audience and sounds better as the performance goes on.On the other hand the DVD works a bit better, because the instrumentals are good and the visuals are good.  Josh is also a performer with a not insignificant stage presence, so that helps.Fortunately, I got the set used, so did not have to pay full price.Lucia Micarelli's performances are extraordinary -- as are the other solo musicians like Tarikh Akoni.Still, with professionals like David Foster involved, you would have thought that they would have noticed the vocals were too lousy for the Cd.",3,"DVD ok, CD lousy",1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,1086,"['quality', 'vocals', 'here', 'totally', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'studio', 'CD', 'bonus', 'CD', 'particular', 'several', 'tracks', 'are', 'truly', 'lousy', 'maybe', 'was', 'mixed', 'differently', 'worse', 'DVD.Josh', 'mentions', 'just', 'finishing', 'tour', 'Presumably', 'tired', 'possibly', 'also', 'sick', 'nasal', 'hoarse', 'also', 'nervous', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'voice', 'off', 'recording', 'warm', 'up', 'performance', 'response', 'enthusiastic', 'audience', 'better', 'performance', 'other', 'hand', 'DVD', 'bit', 'better', 'instrumentals', 'are', 'good', 'visuals', 'are', 'good', 'Josh', 'also', 'performer', 'not', 'insignificant', 'stage', 'presence', 'helps.Fortunately', 'got', 'set', 'used', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'pay', 'full', 'price.Lucia', 'Micarelli', 'performances', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'are', 'other', 'solo', 'musicians', 'Tarikh', 'Akoni.Still', 'professionals', 'David', 'Foster', 'involved', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'noticed', 'vocals', 'were', 'too', 'lousy', 'Cd']",N/A

The problem is will his fans adjust to his change? We need to understand that David Foster was not involved in this 2nd DVD and maybe a different management can be blamed...and yes, who knows, his voice IS changing...I hope not because he really did sound nasal. Oceano was the first song on the Closer CD as well as the ""Live At The Greek"" DVD...he shouldn't have done that! Oceano is one of my favorite songs! He sang ""Remember"" beautifully and ""Canto Alla Vita"" was great...""Never Let Go"" sounded excellent too and the rest of the songs...well, don't need to repeat what I've mentioned before. And whatever happened to ""Confession""? How come he didn't sing that song? Hope ANOTHER and BETTER Live recording comes out next year. Maybe they can put a medley of different shows with songs that he sang beautifully (without the faults) in one dvd!...and with ""Confession"" in it too!

On a few of the songs his voice did seem a bit off--as though he had a bit of a cold.  So that is why I give it a 4 not a 5.In this concert he is much livelier than in his first concert.  For me that added considerably to the enjoyment.His drum solo was both magnificent and well timed.  Five seconds before it started my wife was commenting ""so this version of Canto Alla Vita is not as good as in his first concert"".  Then his drum solo started and my jaw dropped.  Well done Josh!My wife thought that too many songs from his first concert were included in this concert.  Four of his first nine songs fell into that category but after that only one of the remaining eight songs was a repeat.  Personally I was happy with the mix of 5 old songs and 12 new ones.If you are thinking of buying this DVD then I would not treat the 2 out of 5 ratings too seriously.

I couldn't WAIT for this to come out; I couldn't wait to relive my amazing concert experience.Josh's voice was in TOP FORM the whole concert, I was especially amazed with Canto Alla Vita, when he played the drums and synthesizer, the man was ON FIRE!  Remember, the theme song from Troy, written by James Horner and Cynthia Weil, which I did not get to hear when I saw him back in April, was an added song for the summer tour, was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  That was the greatest live performance I've ever heard from him. BRAVO JOSH!  Believe, the theme from Polar Express, is like one of my favorite songs from him, it's just oh so sweet, I'm glad it was included in the extras.

However, given I saw him in concert and how much I like his voice, I bought it anyways(not retail of course). As everyone is stating, ""what the hell happened to his voice? The recording was horrible; one of the worst concert recordings I have ever heard on a DVD"". It sounded like someone brought a handheld tape recorder. It's actually quite embarrassing for Josh to release such a crap sound quality of his voice. He is significantly better than what this dvd sounds like; just buy his other DVD concert, his 1st album; it is like 5 times better in sound quality.  Whoever put this DVD concert together for him should be fired; as the sound quality sucked.  I hope Josh reads all these reviews and learns from this mistake and hires a professional concert recorder; someone who did his last one, or did Sara Brightman.  Another comment to Josh, he needs to become more of an entertainer and grow abit rather than being a kid w/ jeans and just mumbling goofy comments as he did during his concert in the Bay area.  He should speak to Sara Brightman and see what a true entertainer can accomplish in not only in singing, but atmosphere, visuals, lightening, everything. Josh's concert was very weak, me, my mother who loves him and my wife all love his voice but were all very dissappointed by the show. For the amount of money that he is charging, he needs to significantly upgrade his show to be a true entertainer. I paid less for Sara Brightman's Harem concert and it was like 4x better than Josh. Sorry for ragging on him but he needs to seriously upgrade his showmanship.

859646,A1LJZWBVCB44RO,B00064AM8U,"K. Sullivan ""No accounting for taste...""","[51, 51]","I own none of Josh Groban's studio CD's.  I have never viewed his first live performance DVD.  I know a little about him and consider him talented (though not the wunderkind others would suggest).  Some time ago I saw bits of the ""Live at the Greek"" performance on PBS.  I found it enjoyable and was moved by what I saw.  The following day I visited Amazon to see if it was available.  I read all the negative reviews and assumed I must have been confused or duped somehow by what I saw on television.  I could not fathom that all the reviews were ""wrong.""  The majority seemed to be complimentary of Josh Groban while blasting this particular performance.  I concluded that if his fans hated it, it must really be bad.  I therefore decided against ordering it.Finally, many months later, after hearing ""You Raise Me Up"" a number of times on the radio, I decided I would just have to take the risk.  When I ordered it, I decided that after seriously considering its quality I would review it here to present an unbiased albeit subjective view.  I would either lend my voice to the howling critical masses or add one more quiet word of praise to those few sprinkled about.And so I whisper my word of praise to be heard by those who care...  The concert DVD is simply fantastic.  Josh's personality is endearing.  His voice is excellent.  The musicians are incredible.  The staging and effects create a delightful ambience.  You are treated to a thoroughly enjoyable concert experience.Josh appears very comfortable and seems to be enjoying himself.  His piano playing and singing are wonderful (his drumming I can live with or without - if he's having fun with it, good for him).  Lucia Micarelli, the featured violin soloist and concertmaster, is simply a vision.  She plays beautifully and passionately and is a real treat to behold.  The interplay between Josh's voice and her instrument is phenomenal.  Bela Fleck is also quite good in his guest performance.  Highlights for me are the instrumental ""Nocturne/Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Mi Morena"", ""Remember When it Rained"" (this is what Josh's music is really all about), ""Remember"", ""You Raise Me Up"", and ""America"".  The lighting and the visuals on the backstage screens add to the performance without overwhelming it.  It was just a classy production (so what if the audience had light sticks... big deal!).If I have a complaint, it is in the selection of songs featured on the CD.  I wish more content of the DVD was included.  I sorely miss ""You Raise Me Up"".  Several other songs would have been welcome additions as well: ""Nocturne/Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""My December"", and any of the others for that matter.  My suggestion is that if you want a Josh Groban CD, look elsewhere.  This package is all about the DVD.I encourage you not to be frightened away by the overwhelmingly negative reviews by Amazon customers.  I have run across a few products that are overwhelmingly and baselessly criticized in this manner (positive reviews are skewered as unhelpful while negative reviews are extolled as helpful).  You have here a phenomenal performance by a class act and a wonderful supporting cast.  I give the DVD five stars and the CD three stars.

I don't follow Groban enough to know about some of the complaints that seem everywhere on this review page but I do know that I LOVED the concert.Maybe I'm just old and it's easy to impress me? Perhaps. But I know this is a keeper and five star and I'm certainly going to get copies of this for all of my teenage neices and nephews to enjoy.When I see Josh sing it's hard to believe such a beautiful ""older"" sounding voice is coming out of his mouth because he is so young.Loved the violin player, the orchestra, everything.

Choose that & then choose the BEST out of the three audio settings for your TV.At first I had mine on the wrong setting & after messing with it, finally found the correct setting & my DVD sounded perfect.If you DON'T actually have the DTS surround or surround sound equipment added to your TV, then those settings won't work & you won't get the optimal audio.  Choose 'stereo' instead.Also, there ARE still problems with both DVD & CD even after trying all the DVD audio options.PLEASE, if any of you are still having troubles with either or BOTH, write to this address:  liveatthegreek@warnerreprise.com & let them know.There have been recalls of other artists CD's before for production problems & it's also possible there is a defect in the discs.There are many other same complaints here & elsewhere I've seen & Warner Brothers IS looking into the problem.The Greek DVD IS stunning...includes an incredible cover of Paul Simon's ""America"" & a live 'extra bonus' of Josh's song ""Believe"" from The Polar Express movie soundtrack.  I think he sounds even stronger & has more of a vocal range here than on the first 'Josh Groban Live' DVD.  And I'm still stunned by the Debut DVD.I've seen Josh live three times & will see him live two more times next year.  He has NEVER sounded nasally when I've been at a show.  As a matter of fact, each show was BETTER than the last.
