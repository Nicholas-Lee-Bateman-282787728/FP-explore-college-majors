1445027,A3LSB0HOUROUVV,B0057Q8QZS,Peekaboo85024,"[5, 5]",Contains one of my favorite movies of hers-the Little Princess. 2 of the 4 discs are just her very early shorts and the quality is only fair. The other full length movies are early ones and she has extremely minor rolls. Also includes Miracle on 34th St in which she did not appear but has child star Natalie Wood and I love this version. Also includes a short bio of her with a few movie clips but all the clips are of her very early stuff and does not mention her full length movies nor has any pictures of her after about 1936. But the price was less the $5 so figured I would take a chance.,3,Shirley Temple movies,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,594,"['Contains', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'hers-the', 'Little', 'Princess', '2', '4', 'discs', 'are', 'just', 'very', 'early', 'shorts', 'quality', 'only', 'fair', 'other', 'full', 'length', 'movies', 'are', 'early', 'ones', 'extremely', 'minor', 'rolls', 'Also', 'Miracle', '34th', 'St', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'child', 'star', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'love', 'version', 'Also', 'short', 'bio', 'few', 'movie', 'clips', 'clips', 'are', 'very', 'early', 'stuff', 'not', 'mention', 'full', 'length', 'movies', 'pictures', '1936', 'price', 'was', 'less', '5', 'so', 'figured', 'would', 'take', 'chance']",Shirley Temple - Everyone's Little Princess

The only decent watchable is The Little Princess. The quality of A Boy a Girl and a Dog, The Green Promise, Mickey and The Miracle on 34th Street were not that great. Overall this is a nice collection, but I wouldn't recommend it.",5,Shirley Temple - Everyone's Little Princess,1363132800,"03 13, 2013",2013,328,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'Shirley', 'are', 'films', 'here', 'quality', 'are', ""n't"", 'watchable', 'only', 'decent', 'watchable', 'Little', 'Princess', 'quality', 'A', 'Boy', 'Girl', 'Dog', 'Green', 'Promise', 'Mickey', 'Miracle', '34th', 'Street', 'were', 'not', 'great', 'Overall', 'nice', 'collection', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend']",Shirley Temple - Everyone's Little Princess
1445029,A303U1MOXG5R1F,B0057Q8QZS,Sylviastel,"[0, 0]","This product has two DVDs where Shirley Temple appears.The first DVD has her class film adaptation, &#34;The Little Princess.&#34; She is the star of the film. She appears very briefly in &#34;Law of Vengeance&#34; and &#34;The Red Haired Alibi.&#34; The documentary here is done with information and clips of her works only here.The second DVD has several short films where she played Mary Lou Rodgers in some of them.There are some disturbing short films like &#34;Glad Rags to Riches;&#34; &#34;Kid n' Africa;&#34; &#34;Kid n' Hollywood;&#34; and &#34;Polly Tix in Washington.&#34; At the time, these films were spoofs of kids playing adults in adult scenarios.The third disc features a few Our Gang comedy shorts that are adorable but no Shirley Temple. The fourth disc is also Shirley free.This product's intent is misleading since Shirley Temple is prominent on half of the discs here. Now I watched everything here. The film quality is fine even over time. The preservation still holds up on DVDs.I gave two stars for the Shirley Temple DVDs. I would have given more if they featured more of her.
