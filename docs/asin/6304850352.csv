England has granted India its freedom to govern itself after hundreds of years of British rule and has sent Lord Louis Mountbatten as Vicroy to oversee the exchange between governments, civil servants and the army. The starring characters in this series are Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Nehru and Jinna, all with their own agendas to either keep India undivided or to separate into two distinct countries, India with its Hindu religion and Pakistan with Islam as its main religion.

Mountbatten is presented as impossibly heroic, Nehru is a selfless patriot who puts India's interests above all else, and Jinnah's villainy is so malevolent as to make one's skin crawl.  The political realities are largely oversimplified or glossed over.  Nonetheless, it makes for compelling viewing, and does not detract from the respect one must feel for Mountbatten as he took on a job in which it was nearly impossible to succeed.As a production, this is first-rate.  It is well-written & well-acted.  As a DVD transfer, it sucks.  Many other reviewers have commented on Acorn's less-than-stellar track record when it comes to transferring older series to DVD.  This production, only slightly more than 20 years old, looks so grainy at times that it could have been mistaken for a production from the 1960's.But we have to play the cards we are dealt, and this DVD, for better or for worse, is what it is.

437712,A29VKODW4R5U7W,6304850352,dooby,"[42, 44]","This is a splendid 6 part mini-series centering around the end of British rule in India and Lord Mountbatten's role in it. It's a superb production which successfully evokes the splendour of the last days of the British Raj followed by the turmoil and bloodbath of post-independence India. The splendour was deliberate. Mountbatten was adamant that the British would not just slink away. He saw what a monumental occasion this was. As he summed up in a private toast with his wife, this was about ""the birth of India and the death of the British Empire.""The series covers the year immediately preceeding Independence and the year after, effectively Mountbatten's tenure on the sub-continent, as the last Viceroy and then the first Governor-General of India (1946-1948). There is an excellent all-round cast, even with non-Indians playing the major roles - Ian Richardson painted brown as Nehru and a similarly tanned Vladek Sheybal, a Pole by birth, as his arch nemesis Jinnah. History is decidedly seen from the British, or more precisely Mountbatten's, perspective. He and Nehru were close, his wife and Nehru closer still. That intimacy is alluded to very pointedly here. The villain of the piece, as the Amazon reviewer has stated, is clearly Muhammad Ali Jinnah, head of the Muslim League and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah was someone Mountbatten couldn't get close to and didn't trust and he is portrayed here as a slithery snake who schemed and slimed his way towards the painful partition of India and the forced migration of some 14 million people, plus the deaths of up to a million Hindus and Muslims who had to flee to ""their"" side of the border - ethnic cleansing the likes of which dwarf that seen during the more recent Balkans conflict.Such was their friendship that Nehru extended a personal invitation for Mountbatten to stay on as the First Governor-General of independant India. Jinnah on his part immediately installed himself as Governor-General of Pakistan. The series paints Jinnah as the instigator and behind-the-scenes manipulator of the Kashmir conflict which sparked off 2 full scale wars and remains unresolved to this day.The series devotes equal time to both pre and post Independence India, the first 3 episodes revolving around the negotiations with the various factions (Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and the Princely States) preceeding Independence, and the last 3 episodes chronicling the bloodbath that followed partition and the short-lived Dominion of India with Mountbatten as Governor-General before it achieved full republic status in 1950. The series ends with Mountbatten's farewell to India in 1948, including Nehru's touching farewell speech in which he makes plain his love for Lady Mountbatten and his final toast, ""We will remember you... forever."" As a reward for the successful transition to Indian independence, Mountbatten was finally granted an Earldom. He was made 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, a title that was passed on to his eldest daughter upon his death in 1979. This was also in recompense for his having renounced his royal titles (he was the grandson of Queen Victoria and he was born Prince Louis of Battenberg) at the request of the Royal Family during the anti-German hysteria of the First World War.Mention should also be made of the score written by John Scott, especially of the stirring opening theme which is very reminiscent of Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance Marches (the Fourth March in particular), which capture in music the splendour that was once the British Empire.What a shame that this series has been released by Acorn Media. Acorn has a checkered history with regards to DVD quality, their transfers of newer productions looking pretty good but with older series fairing rather poorly. Unfortunately Mountbatten falls into the latter category. Your heart sinks at the opening credits, as the blurry looking Union Jack flutters under the orange glow of the setting sun. It looks like a mediocre VHS tape recording. The picture is soft and blurry, the colours which should have been resplendent (the brilliant crimsons of the Imperial troops, the lush greenery of the countryside) all look drab, dingy and lifeless. Quality improves slightly as the film progresses but not by much. Thankfully the later episodes do improve quite a bit especially at the end. By and large it's a disappointing transfer. It's hard to believe that this production actually dates from 1985. There are 1960s sitcoms that look in better shape than this. One can only hope that another company buys the rights to this series and gives it the proper restoration and remastering that it deserves.",4,Splendid mini-series...

L'hoir,"[7, 8]","As one who remembers only the unpleasant headlines that proclaimed the bloody birth of two nations, I found this series fascinating and instructive. It would, in fact, make an excellent teaching tool for (older) students of World History (with the proper instruction from a professor who is cognizant of the issues of both sides as well as the historical position of the Raj).The actors are, undeniably, superb, although Nicol Williamson was placed in the thankless position of having to appear impossibly noble and level-headed at all times----so much so that the lack of emotion sometimes makes his character seem wooden rather than heroically stiff-upper-lipped. Janet Suzman's performance is so accomplished and executed with such grace that one tends to ignore the questions raised obliquely by the director and/or writers concerning her relationship with her husband and with Nehru (Since the emphasis of the series is on sweeping historical epic, one wonders why the questions were raised at all, since they were left tantalizingly hanging in mid-air). The lack interest by the directors in the family dynamic, in fact, leaves the actress playing their daughter Pamela in the position of being a supernumerary whose only acknowledgment is as one who answers questions politely and walks the dog.Ian Richardson (as always) is superb as Nehru (although  I found his black opaque contact lenses both unnatural and distracting), as is A.K. Hangal's Sardar Patel and Sam Dastor's Gandhi. I was, however, really captivated by Vladek Sheybal's performance as the enigmatic chain-smoking Ali Jinnah, and I wish that the director/writers had taken his motivations beyond his persona as one whose only purpose seems to be to upset the applecart of independence for reasons that are not made clear.Since I did not see the original Masterpiece Theatre production, I was not really bothered by the quality of the color (although on second viewing it does seem a bit washed out). I do, however, feel that Acorn Media could have supplemented the series with meaningfull biographical newsclips rather than the few and rather meager printed lines that they devoted to Lord Mountbatten, whose life was so colorful and eventful beyond his Viceroyalty in India. (One of the reasons that ""Cambridge Spies"" is such an outstanding DVD is not only the excellent drama but also the documentary about the real men and the accompanying BBC newsclips. Even ""Rumpole"" gives us John Mortimer as an extra!). Admittedly, the historical canvas is broad, but it seems to me that a few  supplementary items on important persons and events are called for----especially in light of the high price charged (The extras about the Crusades in ""The Kingdom of Heaven"" provide examples).  As for the Select Filmographies, they are so select that they ignore many of the actors' outstanding performances.Even with the above quibbles, I still recommend ""Lord Mountbatten, the Last Viceroy"" if only to encourage further reading on a fascinating subject, especially in 2007, the sixtieth anniversary of Independence from British rule.",4,Engrossingly Didactic,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,3094,"['one', 'who', 'only', 'unpleasant', 'headlines', 'proclaimed', 'bloody', 'birth', 'two', 'nations', 'found', 'series', 'fascinating', 'instructive', 'would', 'fact', 'make', 'excellent', 'teaching', 'tool', 'older', 'students', 'World', 'History', 'proper', 'instruction', 'professor', 'who', 'cognizant', 'issues', 'sides', 'as', 'well', 'historical', 'position', 'Raj', '.The', 'actors', 'are', 'undeniably', 'superb', 'Nicol', 'Williamson', 'was', 'placed', 'thankless', 'position', 'having', 'appear', 'impossibly', 'noble', 'level-headed', 'times', 'so', 'much', 'lack', 'emotion', 'sometimes', 'character', 'seem', 'rather', 'heroically', 'stiff-upper-lipped', 'Janet', 'Suzman', 'performance', 'so', 'accomplished', 'executed', 'such', 'grace', 'one', 'ignore', 'questions', 'raised', 'obliquely', 'director', 'and/or', 'writers', 'concerning', 'relationship', 'husband', 'Nehru', 'emphasis', 'series', 'sweeping', 'historical', 'epic', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'questions', 'were', 'raised', 'were', 'left', 'tantalizingly', 'hanging', 'mid-air', 'lack', 'interest', 'directors', 'family', 'dynamic', 'fact', 'actress', 'playing', 'daughter', 'Pamela', 'position', 'being', 'supernumerary', 'only', 'acknowledgment', 'one', 'who', 'questions', 'politely', 'walks', 'dog.Ian', 'Richardson', 'always', 'superb', 'Nehru', 'found', 'black', 'opaque', 'contact', 'unnatural', 'distracting', 'A.K', 'Hangal', 'Sardar', 'Patel', 'Sam', 'Dastor', 'Gandhi', 'was', 'however', 'really', 'captivated', 'Vladek', 'Sheybal', 'performance', 'enigmatic', 'chain-smoking', 'Ali', 'Jinnah', 'wish', 'director/writers', 'had', 'taken', 'motivations', 'persona', 'one', 'only', 'purpose', 'be', 'upset', 'applecart', 'independence', 'reasons', 'are', 'not', 'made', 'clear.Since', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'original', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'production', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'bothered', 'quality', 'color', 'second', 'viewing', 'seem', 'bit', 'washed', 'out', 'do', 'however', 'feel', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'could', 'have', 'supplemented', 'series', 'meaningfull', 'biographical', 'newsclips', 'rather', 'few', 'rather', 'meager', 'printed', 'lines', 'devoted', 'Lord', 'Mountbatten', 'life', 'was', 'so', 'colorful', 'eventful', 'Viceroyalty', 'India', 'One', 'reasons', 'Cambridge', 'Spies', 'outstanding', 'DVD', 'not', 'only', 'excellent', 'drama', 'also', 'documentary', 'real', 'men', 'accompanying', 'BBC', 'newsclips', 'Even', 'Rumpole', 'John', 'Mortimer', 'extra', 'Admittedly', 'historical', 'canvas', 'broad', 'few', 'supplementary', 'items', 'important', 'persons', 'events', 'are', 'called', 'especially', 'light', 'high', 'price', 'charged', 'extras', 'Crusades', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'provide', 'examples', 'Select', 'Filmographies', 'are', 'so', 'select', 'ignore', 'many', 'actors', 'outstanding', 'performances.Even', 'above', 'quibbles', 'still', 'recommend', 'Lord', 'Mountbatten', 'Last', 'Viceroy', 'only', 'encourage', 'further', 'reading', 'fascinating', 'subject', 'especially', '2007', 'sixtieth', 'anniversary', 'Independence', 'British', 'rule']",N/A

All of this is portrayed brilliantly by Nicole Williamson in this superb production about Mountbatten's terms as last Viceroy of India as well as its first Governor-General.However, this series does not only focus on Mountbatten but shows the political and religious forces at work that brought about both India's independence, but also the savage violence that accompanied the partition of the sub-continent and the legacy of hate and religious fanaticism that now threaten not only the successor states, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, but possibly the entire world due to their nuclear arsenals.The series also features excellent performances by Janet Suzman as Lady Edwina Mountbatten who was one of the great ""do-gooders"" of history, Vladek Sheybal as the enigmatic,iron-willed, tubercular Mohammed Ali Jinnah, and especially Sam Dastor as Gandhi whose portrayal of him is far superior to that of Ben Kingsley in the film ""Gandhi"".One drawback of the series is that it is based heavily on the memoirs of Mountbatten and his assistant Alan Campbell-Johnson who were clearly biased against Jinnah and fans of Nehru and Gandhi, blaming the partition of India solely on Jinnah's ""stubborness"". Other historians have a more nuanced view of the Indian leaders pointing out that Jinnah did accept the idea of a united India under a loose Federal system and that it was Nehru and Gandhi's Congress Party that rejected it giving Jinnah no alternative but to seek total separation for India's Muslims. Similarly, Jinnah is portrayed as responsible for the war in Kashmir, whereas according to the rules that defined the partition, the majority religious group should have been able to choose which successor state they associated with, but Kashmir's majority Muslims were never given this opportunity becuase Nehru, being a Kashmiri himself, was insistent on taking Kashmir for India.None of this detracts, however, from the sheer pleasure of seeing this vast panorama portrayed on the television.

And I decide to acquire the splendid series now for my audio-visual library...!  The chaotic and sometimes murderous circumstances leading to India's independence have often been misunderstood and not known indepth... and there are also  the age-old, bothersome  caste system and the bi-polar religious difference - Hinduism and Islam - that eventually brought to the ferocious  fore in the division of India...! Obviously, the Indians of their Hindu faith want to remain in India and the Muslims (which in the minority) want to form a new nation called finally as Pakistan. Then there are also the many mini states within British India which have their own kings or Rajas and they too  want a political say and a guarantee of their rich estates and sequential succession, if politically possible in an independent India...!  Then there are the Sikhs which is another visible but important minority which also want a say in the future government of independent India. Hence, the Last Viceroy, Lord Louis Mountabtten has to rely on his own wits and independence of power vested upon him to negotiate amicably and effectively with the future Indian and Pakistan officials and bigwigs within a very short time which he has imposed upon himself to complete the job...! Mountbatten is friendly, approachable and apparently understands the Indian philosphy and pysche...and he has been very successful to gain the leaders' understanding and cooperation to bring finally the country into complete independence. The most problematic question was the division of the land and which to be awarded  to India and the others to Pakistan...needing complete understanding and at times to push the issues through to enable the successful conclusion of McMahon to draw up the plan of land division within a couple of weeks and his result demands  the sleight of art in  cartography and  has  to be, one way or another, accepted by the contending leaders in question...!!! Even the respected Great Teacher or Mahatma Ghandi, which at first refused absolutely to the political and religious  division of the land, to finally and grudingly  bend towards Mountbatten to the final and irrevocable dividing of the two peoples - Indians and Pakistanis...only to be gun down by a fanatical and extremist Hindu. That the Mountbattens have  done a splendid job in ushring in India's independence from Great Britain is a matter of history now and its critical judgement!  I would say that the DVD is worth buying from Amazon.com and worth the while watching to understand the ebb and flow of Indian  history in Greater Asia today!

437716,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,6304850352,John D. Cofield,"[7, 8]","Lord Mountbatten: The Last Viceroy, is a history of the final tumultuous weeks of the British Raj.  In the post World War II period maintaining control of India was no longer practical for Britain, and the Labour Government agreed to negotiate independence for the subcontinent, which was seething with discontent and religious and ethnic strife.Lord Louis Mountbatten, great-grandson of Queen Victoria and second cousin of King George VI, was chosen as the last Viceroy.  Lord Louis and his wife Edwina Ashley had been glittering members of London Society since the 1920s.  During World War II they both revealed hitherto unsuspected depth, Lord Louis as one of the principal Allied naval leaders in the war against Japan, and Edwina in dealing with the catastrophic health and relief efforts caused by the conflict.This 6 part series is a good depiction of the  enormous problems India faced in 1946-1948 and of the Mountbattens' attempt to deal with them. The rioting and massacre scenes are intense, leaving little to the imagination.  Mahatma Gandhi is well acted, but Nehru and Jinnah tend  to come off less well, primarily because the series focuses so much on Mountbatten and his British assistants.  Edwina, admirably played by Janet Suzman, is really the heroine of the series as she attempts to alleviate the sufferings of the millions of Hindus and Muslims.  Her relationship with Nehru, which has been the subject of intense speculation and gossip over the years, is left up in the air, and different viewers will come to different conclusions as to how physical it became.This series does a good job explaining the decolonization process from a Eurocentric point of view.  Just be aware that Nehru and Jinnah would seem far more active and positive protagonists were six part series filmed depicting their roles in the ending of the Raj.",5,Grand Historical Epic,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,1851,"['Lord', 'Mountbatten', 'Last', 'Viceroy', 'history', 'final', 'tumultuous', 'weeks', 'British', 'Raj', 'post', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'period', 'maintaining', 'control', 'India', 'was', 'longer', 'practical', 'Britain', 'Labour', 'Government', 'agreed', 'negotiate', 'independence', 'subcontinent', 'was', 'seething', 'discontent', 'religious', 'ethnic', 'strife.Lord', 'Louis', 'Mountbatten', 'great-grandson', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'second', 'cousin', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'was', 'chosen', 'last', 'Viceroy', 'Lord', 'Louis', 'wife', 'Edwina', 'Ashley', 'had', 'been', 'glittering', 'members', 'London', 'Society', '1920s', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'revealed', 'hitherto', 'unsuspected', 'depth', 'Lord', 'Louis', 'one', 'principal', 'Allied', 'naval', 'leaders', 'war', 'Japan', 'Edwina', 'dealing', 'catastrophic', 'health', 'relief', 'efforts', 'caused', 'conflict.This', '6', 'part', 'series', 'good', 'depiction', 'enormous', 'problems', 'India', 'faced', '1946-1948', 'Mountbattens', 'attempt', 'deal', 'rioting', 'massacre', 'scenes', 'are', 'intense', 'leaving', 'little', 'imagination', 'Mahatma', 'Gandhi', 'well', 'acted', 'Nehru', 'Jinnah', 'tend', 'come', 'off', 'less', 'well', 'primarily', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'Mountbatten', 'British', 'assistants', 'Edwina', 'admirably', 'played', 'Janet', 'Suzman', 'really', 'heroine', 'series', 'alleviate', 'sufferings', 'millions', 'Hindus', 'Muslims', 'relationship', 'Nehru', 'been', 'subject', 'intense', 'speculation', 'gossip', 'years', 'left', 'up', 'air', 'different', 'viewers', 'will', 'come', 'different', 'conclusions', 'how', 'physical', 'became.This', 'series', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'decolonization', 'process', 'Eurocentric', 'point', 'view', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', 'Nehru', 'Jinnah', 'would', 'seem', 'far', 'more', 'active', 'positive', 'protagonists', 'were', 'six', 'part', 'series', 'filmed', 'depicting', 'roles', 'ending', 'Raj']",N/A
437717,A269XJ46O7O7AC,6304850352,Movie Watch,"[4, 4]","For those who like historical narrative and particularly films about the Raj, this will be a very welcome addition to your film collection. Superbly scripted, with intelligent dialogue and meticulous attention to visual detail, ""The Last Viceroy"" is a fascinating mini-series.  My only regret is that it wasn't several hours longer.Shot in India, England and Sri Lanka, the art direction is eyefilling and wonderfully layered; I have watched this series at least a half dozen times, and each time I discovered new details that added to my appreciation.. Direction, cinematography and editing smoothly engage the viewer in the story and match what we have come to expect from the finest in British television and filmmaking. Although ""Jewel in the Crown"" was much longer and more detailed in regard to the background of both the Raj and the events of Indian Independence, I prefer ""The Last Viceroy"" because it made better use of textured characters to create empathy for the human dilemmas implicit in this complex series of events.Arguments that the series fails to represent all of the complicated viewpoints and actualities of the events really seem beside the point.  First, because it does not purport to be a documentary; it's a narrative interpretation of both character and events and takes some literary license with both. and, second, because it's just such a fascinating story. One can always savage any novel or bio-pic because it doesn't have perfect alignment with ""factual"" research, whether that research is the product of six months investigation or a lifetime of pouring over historical documents.  In actuality all research is interpretive--no matter what form it takes--this series is British-produced, and offers one way to tell the story; surely any thoughtful viewer will recognize that and assume there are other viewpoints. There are many interesting and well-produced Indian films that present other (and, one might add, equally diverse) overviews of the struggle for independence. This is one side of the story, and it is exceptionally well done.One strong point in its favor (even beyond the intelligence of the script and the artistic execution of the production value), is the richness of Janet Suzman's portrayal of Lady Mountbatten.  This is as much her story as it is his, and the script strongly emphasizes that fact. Edwina Mountbatten was a complex woman, born into great wealth and privilege, whose early life gave little indication of the extraordinary strength and social compassion she would display during and after the events of World War II. She came into her own during the years in Asia, and her contributions to social welfare programs and refugee relief were in no small measure responsible for the Mountbattens' collective reputation in post-war Burma and the final days of the Raj in India.As to Lady Mountbatten's relationship with Nehru, it is hard to believe that someone could watch ""The Last Viceroy"" and not come away with the realization that these two had had a passionate exchange of love. Other books and films may contradict that premise, but the script and actors' presentation in this mini series clearly presents them as lovers, even though no scenes of sexual liaison are shown. Watch Suzman's face and her body language in her scenes with Richardson--surely the portrayal of a woman who has intimate knowledge of this man,The music makes enormous contribution to both the overall mood of the piece and to the impact of individual scenes. The script gives density of character and detail without becoming ponderous, and the director balances small details of human emotion against the pageantry of historical events; he captures both the enormity of crowd scenes and the intimacy of drawing conversations with equal grace.It startles me that some reviewers on this site have downgraded the acting; it makes me think we were watching different versions, because Williamson, Suzman and Richardson provide passion, nuance and depth to their respective characters that is as good as one could ask for.This dvd is a treasured item in my collection. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical drama, challenging scripts, fine production values and excellent acting. Even if you have little knowledge of the Raj, you can appreciate a good story well-told.",5,Eye-filling and wonderfully layered.,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,4316,"['who', 'like', 'historical', 'narrative', 'particularly', 'films', 'Raj', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'welcome', 'addition', 'film', 'collection', 'Superbly', 'scripted', 'intelligent', 'dialogue', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'visual', 'detail', 'Last', 'Viceroy', 'fascinating', 'mini-series', 'only', 'regret', 'was', ""n't"", 'several', 'hours', 'longer.Shot', 'India', 'England', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'art', 'direction', 'eyefilling', 'wonderfully', 'layered', 'have', 'watched', 'series', 'least', 'half', 'dozen', 'times', 'time', 'discovered', 'new', 'details', 'added', 'appreciation..', 'Direction', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'smoothly', 'engage', 'viewer', 'story', 'match', 'what', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'finest', 'British', 'television', 'filmmaking', 'Jewel', 'Crown', 'was', 'much', 'longer', 'more', 'detailed', 'regard', 'background', 'Raj', 'events', 'Indian', 'Independence', 'prefer', 'Last', 'Viceroy', 'made', 'better', 'use', 'textured', 'characters', 'create', 'empathy', 'human', 'dilemmas', 'implicit', 'complex', 'series', 'events.Arguments', 'series', 'represent', 'complicated', 'viewpoints', 'actualities', 'events', 'really', 'seem', 'beside', 'point', 'First', 'not', 'purport', 'be', 'documentary', 'narrative', 'interpretation', 'character', 'events', 'literary', 'license', 'second', 'just', 'such', 'fascinating', 'story', 'One', 'can', 'always', 'savage', 'novel', 'bio-pic', ""n't"", 'have', 'perfect', 'alignment', 'factual', 'research', 'research', 'product', 'six', 'months', 'investigation', 'lifetime', 'pouring', 'over', 'historical', 'documents', 'actuality', 'research', 'interpretive', 'matter', 'what', 'series', 'British-produced', 'one', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'surely', 'thoughtful', 'viewer', 'will', 'recognize', 'assume', 'are', 'other', 'viewpoints', 'are', 'many', 'interesting', 'well-produced', 'Indian', 'films', 'present', 'other', 'one', 'might', 'add', 'equally', 'diverse', 'overviews', 'struggle', 'independence', 'one', 'side', 'story', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done.One', 'strong', 'point', 'favor', 'even', 'intelligence', 'script', 'artistic', 'execution', 'production', 'value', 'richness', 'Janet', 'Suzman', 'portrayal', 'Lady', 'Mountbatten', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'script', 'strongly', 'fact', 'Edwina', 'Mountbatten', 'was', 'complex', 'woman', 'born', 'great', 'wealth', 'privilege', 'early', 'life', 'gave', 'little', 'indication', 'extraordinary', 'strength', 'social', 'compassion', 'would', 'display', 'events', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'came', 'own', 'years', 'Asia', 'contributions', 'social', 'welfare', 'programs', 'refugee', 'relief', 'were', 'small', 'measure', 'responsible', 'Mountbattens', 'collective', 'reputation', 'post-war', 'Burma', 'final', 'days', 'Raj', 'India.As', 'Lady', 'Mountbatten', 'relationship', 'Nehru', 'hard', 'believe', 'someone', 'could', 'watch', 'Last', 'Viceroy', 'not', 'come', 'away', 'realization', 'two', 'had', 'had', 'passionate', 'exchange', 'love', 'Other', 'books', 'films', 'may', 'contradict', 'premise', 'script', 'actors', 'presentation', 'mini', 'series', 'clearly', 'lovers', 'even', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'liaison', 'are', 'shown', 'Watch', 'Suzman', 'face', 'body', 'language', 'scenes', 'Richardson', 'surely', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'who', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'man', 'music', 'enormous', 'contribution', 'overall', 'mood', 'piece', 'impact', 'individual', 'scenes', 'script', 'density', 'character', 'detail', 'becoming', 'ponderous', 'director', 'small', 'details', 'human', 'emotion', 'pageantry', 'historical', 'events', 'enormity', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'intimacy', 'drawing', 'conversations', 'equal', 'grace.It', 'startles', 'reviewers', 'site', 'have', 'downgraded', 'acting', 'were', 'watching', 'different', 'versions', 'Williamson', 'Suzman', 'Richardson', 'provide', 'passion', 'nuance', 'depth', 'respective', 'characters', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'could', 'ask', 'for.This', 'dvd', 'treasured', 'item', 'collection', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'historical', 'drama', 'challenging', 'scripts', 'fine', 'production', 'values', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Even', 'have', 'little', 'knowledge', 'Raj', 'can', 'appreciate', 'good', 'story', 'well-told']",N/A

Though it cries out for better ""extras,"" given the amount of historical documentation available, I had no real complaints with the transfer, which seemed bright and crisp. And the series itself is even more wonderful than I remembered, with sterling performances all around, first-class production values and the true feel of an ""epic.""  (Its canvas seems at least as great as the bigger-budget ""Gandhi,"" and though I loved Ben Kingsley's performance, I was just as moved by the small scenes involving this ""Gandhiji."")  Twenty years later, too, I am able to put these events into even greater historical perspective, especially the ongoing tragedy caused by partition.  But I am even more deeply stirred by the (also ongoing) struggle of many individual Indian people to respond with compassion and nonviolence in a world that seldom seeks nonviolence as a first response.  The series shows unflinchingly the brutality, mindless violence and random acts of hatred, but balances it with quiet scenes of anguish, love and compassion.  I can't recall a pairing quite as touching as that of Nehru and Lady Mountbatten, finely tuned to each other's feelings, drawn obviously by a subtle erotic current, but above all, adults balancing duty, power and a deep compassion.  If the series idealizes its characters, it does so without making them cardboard or anything more or less than human.

437721,A1NFSO6GIDS23D,6304850352,T. J. Friedman,"[9, 10]","This is certainly one of the classics of Masterpiece Theater and is highly recommended to all who are interested in historical drama.  It is a marvelously and beautifully realized set-piece that, for the most part, accurately describes the chaotic events that occurred during the days and months that led up to independance of the India and Pakistan (and the early nationhood of each).The characterizations of the leads and of all the actors in the cast are stunning and it is easy to forget that you are not watching a re-creation of the events.I was particularly impressed with the performance of Vladek Sheybal as Ali Jinnah and A. K. Hangal who played Sardar Patel.  Sheybal's aloofness and calculating manner simply nailed the Jinnah about whom I have read and Hangal's Patel was a brilliant ""wheeler-dealer,"" manipulator and above all, a realist as I believe Patel clearly was.  They clearly outshined their more famous rivals, Nicol Williamson and Ian Richardson, who turned in their expected star performances and yet did not bring out the souls of their characters in the same depth as did Sheybal and Hangal.  Perhaps this was due to Mountbatten and Nehru being far more complex and greater men.  It is difficult to assess.  Janet Susman was marvelous as Lady Mountbatten and provided just the proper amount of tension to bring out some needed depth in the Mountbatten character that would otherwise have been lacking.  Dastor's Gandhi was just fine, yet coming a scant three years after Kingley's Gandhi, it would certainly seem to be in the shadow of that portrayal.  Yet it is satisfying.This set is particularly recommended to all with an interest in Indian history.  I have to admit that I am prejudiced in favor of India, having traveled to India in the 1970's and having lived with families there.  While there, I lectured on our U.S. First Amendment (Freedom of Speech) as the Emergency and subsequent election of the Janata Party occurred.  During this time, I had many discussions with Indian friends concerning their thoughts about the Raj.  Of course most agreed that independence had been inevitable for the world's largest democracy and that colonialism had not been very satisfactory for them.  Today, I am amused that I could even think to ask about the obvious, but the answers to these questions were not so to a naive young man and the Indian folks I met were always gracious and patient in answering my questions - both common Indian traits, which I am pleased to note can be easily seen in this film.",5,A Classic Finally on DVD,1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,2531,"['certainly', 'one', 'classics', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'historical', 'drama', 'marvelously', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'set-piece', 'most', 'part', 'accurately', 'chaotic', 'events', 'occurred', 'days', 'months', 'led', 'up', 'independance', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'early', 'nationhood', '.The', 'characterizations', 'leads', 'actors', 'cast', 'are', 'stunning', 'easy', 'forget', 'are', 'not', 'watching', 're-creation', 'events.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'performance', 'Vladek', 'Sheybal', 'Ali', 'Jinnah', 'A.', 'K.', 'Hangal', 'who', 'played', 'Sardar', 'Patel', 'Sheybal', 'aloofness', 'calculating', 'manner', 'simply', 'nailed', 'Jinnah', 'whom', 'have', 'read', 'Hangal', 'Patel', 'was', 'brilliant', 'wheeler-dealer', 'manipulator', 'realist', 'believe', 'Patel', 'clearly', 'was', 'clearly', 'outshined', 'more', 'famous', 'rivals', 'Nicol', 'Williamson', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'who', 'turned', 'expected', 'star', 'performances', 'yet', 'did', 'not', 'bring', 'out', 'souls', 'characters', 'same', 'depth', 'did', 'Sheybal', 'Hangal', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'due', 'Mountbatten', 'Nehru', 'being', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'greater', 'men', 'difficult', 'assess', 'Janet', 'Susman', 'was', 'marvelous', 'Lady', 'Mountbatten', 'provided', 'just', 'proper', 'amount', 'tension', 'bring', 'out', 'needed', 'depth', 'Mountbatten', 'character', 'would', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'lacking', 'Dastor', 'Gandhi', 'was', 'just', 'fine', 'yet', 'coming', 'scant', 'three', 'years', 'Kingley', 'Gandhi', 'would', 'certainly', 'seem', 'be', 'shadow', 'portrayal', 'satisfying.This', 'set', 'particularly', 'recommended', 'interest', 'Indian', 'history', 'have', 'admit', 'am', 'prejudiced', 'favor', 'India', 'having', 'traveled', 'India', '1970', 'having', 'lived', 'families', 'there', 'there', 'lectured', 'U.S.', 'First', 'Amendment', 'Freedom', 'Speech', 'Emergency', 'subsequent', 'election', 'Janata', 'Party', 'occurred', 'time', 'had', 'many', 'discussions', 'Indian', 'friends', 'concerning', 'thoughts', 'Raj', 'course', 'most', 'agreed', 'independence', 'had', 'been', 'inevitable', 'world', 'largest', 'democracy', 'colonialism', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'very', 'satisfactory', 'Today', 'am', 'amused', 'could', 'even', 'think', 'ask', 'obvious', 'answers', 'questions', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'naive', 'young', 'man', 'Indian', 'folks', 'met', 'were', 'always', 'gracious', 'patient', 'answering', 'questions', 'common', 'Indian', 'traits', 'am', 'pleased', 'note', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'seen', 'film']",N/A
