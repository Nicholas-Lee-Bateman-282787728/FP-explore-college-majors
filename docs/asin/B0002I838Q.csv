834641,A2BJ3MTMMW4L37,B0002I838Q,adil ali,"[19, 47]","Prior to writing this review, I spent a few minutes contemplating on whether to give this a 1 star or 2.  I took pity on the show and gave it a 2, simply because it does occasionally touch on themes that are universal.  In a few episodes, we see Simon being bullied at school, debating whether or not to smoke, and facing other difficult circumstances.One gets tired of the all-American portrayal of the Campden family after a while, especially the political correctness which the show emphasizes and forces down the viewer's throat.  For example, the willingness of the parents to let their children mingle with some local Black children without ever once hinting at racial prejudice is totally unrealistic.  The manner in which the White and Black families talk, as if there are no racial barriers in the world is a bit amusing.  Surely, a family like the Campden's, who wanted to spare their children of the horrors of inner city life, and hence took refuge in the suburbs would raise their eyebrows at their children mixing with minorities.There are a few other aspects of the show which initially irked me, but are now quite amusing.  When one of the Campden's is bullied, the show always searches for a motive for why the bully is as he is, as if it is some domestic problem which drives him to it.  Most bullies, choose to bully not out of any ""insecurities"" or ""hangups"", but do so just for the heck of it.

After reading about the lives of the actors (their divorces and drug abuse), I was appalled at the hypocrisies.  The mother who is suppose to be ""fair yet hard"" is a selfish witch. God help anyone with a mother like her or someone who watches the program and thinks this is an example of good parenting. The father is more busy with the church and community's business than his own children or demanding perfection from his children.  Stephen Collins, who played the father,  has the most annoying hand gestures. The story line about the eldest daughter Mary (played by Jessica Biel) was uncomfortable as she went from a straight A student athletic who then drops out of school, marries and abandons her son. It is a story line that would be confusing to children so I consider it irresponsible since the program is known for portraying the importance of family values. The musical episodes are painful to watch since except for a couple exceptions, the cast cannot sing or dance. The Associate Pastor who didn't believe in smoking or drinking was on Celebrity Rehab in 2010. Season 10 was the worst with the addition of untalented actresses.

To reflect on his vast TV career, he was diverse in his shows (everything from Love Boat, Fantasy Island, SWAT, Vegas, Hart to Hart, 90210, Melrose Place, Dynasty) and also on the pulse of what America wanted. One of his two last great shows was 7th Heaven. The other was Charmed.The plot is a simple family show. A large family (the Camdens) with a father  who is a minster, a mom who is always there for her children and their kids. The kids have their problems, and this isnt a sitcom where the problem goes away in 30 minutes of less. This show tackles issues and it seem REAL. These episodes will make you think long after you seen the episode...Isnt that what good TV is all about!Note there are NO audio commentaries.

834652,ACVBZF3GK3O45,B0002I838Q,C. Davis,"[0, 0]","I love this series.I have not seen every episode of every season. However, I did watch the first four seasons and parts of the last three seasons.So, the basic context of series is a middle-aged Reverend, possibly Episcopalian - but not sure, who along with his wife raises five children in a moderate sized town somewhere in northern California. The church is not a mega-church, nor is it a tiny 20+ member church that is surviving by the skin of its teeth.The gimmick in the title is that there are seven members of the Camden family, thus the 7 in the title. It gets a little tricky as the children age out of the family home and the Rev Camden seems to take in a few stray children to keep the number of family members in his house correct for the title.This show does not get in your face with spiritual solutions to problems. Although, I do think it might be nice if they did focus on the spiritual more. Despite this, if you pay attention, one can tell that often the love of family (or community or friends) is intended to represent God's love. Likewise, the desire for redemption or forgiveness represents the need for a higher power in our lives.Between the church, the school, and the household and the touch points between those organizations and the larger community and extended family members there are plenty of stories to share. I suspect that some of the stories - because they reference the Clinton administration, the Gulf War, or some of the health impacts of specific over the counter diet supplements - might be a bit dated for younger viewers.  But maybe not, a deployed father (or mother) is a deployed father regardless of if it is the Gulf War or some future conflict yet to be determined.What I like most about this series is that it is mostly about a family dealing with real issues that you might encounter in a mid-sized California town in a way that is, for the most part, hopeful, optimistic, and based on love of their fellow man.However, the Camden parents do seem to be a bit schizophrenic. Sometimes they are extremely strict on very minor things and other times they turn a blind eye to potentially very serious issues.  Likewise, they can be very forgiving of ex-cons in one episode and very judgmental in the next.  Usually, this is done to make a point in that particular storyline in terms of redemption or personal accountability, but it can be a bit grating if you watch several episodes in one sitting.Likewise, I think, because it is a television show and not real life, the show tends to gloss over how hard it is for individuals to positively change their lives, deal with addiction, bounce back from a felony conviction (if that is even possible in this day and age), or extricate themselves from being pressured into doing dangerous things from either a gang or an overzealous prosecutor. Sometimes an individual does have emotional or spiritual breakthroughs that allow them to change their life on a dime, but even in those cases, their families, friends, and employers are rarely so forgiving. However, in 7th Heaven world, a person agrees to go to therapy or join a twelve step program or an inpatient treatment facility or spiritual counseling and often within the same episode their lives are well on track to being back to normal. I suspect that most people dealing with issues that force them to seek help probably need weeks, months, and, maybe years, to learn the tools and coping mechanisms to deal with their issue in a healthy way.Additionally, the romantic entanglements of the Camden children are often the focus of the stories in the individual episodes. While I realize that this is necessary to attract younger viewers, it does get a bit annoying. This humble reviewer thought that there could be more of a focus on Rev Camden's work in the community just to keep the storylines more diversified.But even with those tiny complaints, this is a good show that teaches character and entertains at the same time.I highly recommend this show and will eventually watch all of the episodes.",5,A GOOD SHOW THAT YOU CAN WATCH WITH ANYONE,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,4051,"['love', 'series.I', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'episode', 'season', 'However', 'did', 'watch', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'parts', 'last', 'three', 'seasons.So', 'basic', 'context', 'series', 'middle-aged', 'Reverend', 'possibly', 'Episcopalian', 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'wife', 'five', 'children', 'moderate', 'sized', 'town', 'somewhere', 'northern', 'California', 'church', 'not', 'mega-church', 'tiny', '20+', 'member', 'church', 'surviving', 'skin', 'teeth.The', 'gimmick', 'title', 'are', 'seven', 'members', 'Camden', 'family', 'thus', '7', 'title', 'little', 'tricky', 'children', 'age', 'family', 'home', 'Rev', 'Camden', 'take', 'few', 'stray', 'children', 'keep', 'number', 'family', 'members', 'house', 'correct', 'title.This', 'show', 'not', 'get', 'face', 'spiritual', 'solutions', 'problems', 'do', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'nice', 'did', 'focus', 'spiritual', 'more', 'pay', 'attention', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'often', 'love', 'family', 'community', 'friends', 'intended', 'represent', 'God', 'love', 'Likewise', 'desire', 'redemption', 'forgiveness', 'need', 'higher', 'power', 'lives.Between', 'church', 'school', 'household', 'touch', 'points', 'organizations', 'larger', 'community', 'extended', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'plenty', 'stories', 'share', 'suspect', 'stories', 'reference', 'Clinton', 'administration', 'Gulf', 'War', 'health', 'impacts', 'specific', 'counter', 'diet', 'supplements', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'dated', 'younger', 'viewers', 'maybe', 'not', 'deployed', 'father', 'mother', 'deployed', 'father', 'regardless', 'Gulf', 'War', 'future', 'conflict', 'yet', 'be', 'determined.What', 'like', 'most', 'series', 'mostly', 'family', 'dealing', 'real', 'issues', 'might', 'encounter', 'mid-sized', 'California', 'town', 'way', 'most', 'part', 'hopeful', 'optimistic', 'based', 'love', 'fellow', 'man.However', 'Camden', 'parents', 'do', 'seem', 'be', 'bit', 'schizophrenic', 'Sometimes', 'are', 'extremely', 'strict', 'very', 'minor', 'things', 'other', 'times', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'potentially', 'very', 'serious', 'issues', 'Likewise', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'forgiving', 'ex-cons', 'one', 'episode', 'very', 'judgmental', 'next', 'Usually', 'done', 'make', 'point', 'particular', 'storyline', 'terms', 'redemption', 'personal', 'accountability', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'grating', 'watch', 'several', 'episodes', 'one', 'sitting.Likewise', 'think', 'television', 'show', 'not', 'real', 'life', 'show', 'gloss', 'how', 'hard', 'individuals', 'positively', 'change', 'lives', 'deal', 'addiction', 'bounce', 'back', 'felony', 'conviction', 'even', 'possible', 'day', 'age', 'extricate', 'being', 'pressured', 'doing', 'dangerous', 'things', 'gang', 'overzealous', 'prosecutor', 'Sometimes', 'individual', 'have', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'breakthroughs', 'allow', 'change', 'life', 'dime', 'even', 'cases', 'families', 'friends', 'employers', 'are', 'rarely', 'forgiving', 'However', '7th', 'Heaven', 'world', 'person', 'go', 'therapy', 'join', 'twelve', 'step', 'program', 'inpatient', 'treatment', 'facility', 'spiritual', 'counseling', 'often', 'same', 'episode', 'lives', 'are', 'well', 'track', 'being', 'back', 'normal', 'suspect', 'most', 'people', 'dealing', 'issues', 'force', 'seek', 'help', 'probably', 'need', 'weeks', 'months', 'maybe', 'years', 'learn', 'tools', 'coping', 'mechanisms', 'deal', 'issue', 'healthy', 'way.Additionally', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'Camden', 'children', 'are', 'often', 'focus', 'stories', 'individual', 'episodes', 'realize', 'necessary', 'attract', 'younger', 'viewers', 'get', 'bit', 'annoying', 'humble', 'reviewer', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'focus', 'Rev', 'Camden', 'work', 'community', 'just', 'keep', 'storylines', 'more', 'diversified.But', 'even', 'tiny', 'complaints', 'good', 'show', 'character', 'entertains', 'same', 'time.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'will', 'eventually', 'watch', 'episodes']",N/A

It is so refreshing to see a show on Primetime TV that is not hot and steamy teens sleeping around, getting high, or abusing or being abused.

It restores your faith in family and in GOD and that with him in your family you can over come anything.  7th Heaven I hope will be around for another 10 seasons.  If you haven't watched it Please do.  Then start watch the reruns that are in syndication from the beginning or purchase the seasons on DVD.  You will be so glad you did.

The father (Eric) is a minister and the mother (Annie) is a stay-at-home mom and they have their hands full dealing with all the issues that arise with raising five children.Warning:  while this is definitely a family show, topics are dealt with that may not be appropriate for younger children.  There is teen-age pregnancy, church burning and racism along with a host of other serious/mature issues.

834667,APDUCWHP5J905,B0002I838Q,Julia S.,"[20, 71]","The show is very biased and very politically correct to the point where realisim of the real live is none existent. You would think that if the father is the priest, it is supposed to be the family of high morals, forgiveness and good behavior. On the contrary, it is a family of degenerates who can't live one day without getting into trouble. The parents keep their kids on a VERY tight leash, no wonder they always get in trouble. The funniest part is the punishment, after they ""learn their lesson"" and get grounded, everybody resumes talking and joking like nothing's happened. Huh? Kids get grounded even for the stupidest minor things which normal people will overlook. Younger childern Ruthie and Simon are 20 years too young for the dialog that was written for them, kids their age never talk like that. Everybody always overdramatizes the problems. Somebody broke a nail, oh my God!! It's the end of the world. Matt had a date with an older woman, oh my God!!! Instead talking to her son about it the mother believed her high school friend whome she hasn't seen in years!! So much for the family morals and family trust.I cannot decide who is more annoying Eric or Annie with their self righteousness and unforgiveness. They bud into everybody elses business and manage to resolve it by the end of each episode and everyone is happy. Like in the episode where a father will not pay child support and mom and the daughter live in the slums of the city. The father is stubborn, nobody persuaded him before, even the court didn't do anything, but Reverend Campden to the rescue, after a 3 minute conversation the father suddenly decides to be a nice guy and take care of his daughter. Problem solved in 3 mintes. The high light of the 1st season was when they threw a ""good bye"" party for Ruthie's imaginary friend and gave speaches about how good he was.

Not a show that followed the same formula of Spelling's other works (Beverly Hills 90210 and Dynasty), 7th Heaven was about a minister's family.  The Camdens are like any family with its problems and crisis, but this show also celebrates the simple things in life - births, weddings, school, friends, things that happen to real family.  The writing is crisp, and the style is easy-going, with a sense of humor.  Like a friend of the Camden clan, we are sucked into their everyday concerns until, we too, share tears at the wedding and laugh at babysitting accidents along with the Camdens.

834670,A14A4YYKPLYY26,B0002I838Q,LactivistAnti-VaccineLiberal,"[4, 5]","When7th Heaven seriesfirst premiered on the WB in August 1996, I did not really know about it - that I can remember. It wasn't until the late spring or early summer of 1998 (the end of the 2nd Season) that I found out about 7th Heaven and started watching this WONDERFUL series.From the first episode I saw, I have loved this show, and taped every single episode since. But sometimes, if my VCR went on the fritz, or their was a power outage, I might have missed a part or all of some episodes, and even though I made sure to tape it, when it aired in reruns, I am so glad to have the original uncut version on DVD!I LOVE this 7th Heaven DVD set! It is just FABULOUS!! I am a HUGE 7th Heaven fan, and it is SO nice to be able to just pop in a DVD and have any episode during the first 2 seasons right at my fingertips, and not have to rewind and fast-forward through a multitude of tapes to find the episode I want.I only have a few minor quibbles about this DVD set.One, there are no sub-titles or official captioning. What I mean by ""official closed captioning"" is that my TV includes closed captioning as one of its features.As such, even though DVD sets like 7th Heaven don't offer closed captioning, if I have the feature enabled on my TV, captions still show up. However, some DVD sets (likeLittle House on the Prairie, orPunky Brewster) must have the TV captions feature disabled because even though I have closed captioning enabled on my TV it does not show up. Fortunately, the 7th Heaven DVD creators have NOT done this, so if your TV has a closed-captions feature, you should still be able to get them. So for me, this is a very minor concern since I can still get captions from my TV.Another quibble that I have is that these DVD's don't have a scene index for each episode. This forces the viewer to have to fast forward through the entire episode if they want to watch a scene near the end.Also there are NO Special Features on this set. When people buy DVDs, especially for TV shows, they are getting the DVDs so that they can get special features that they would NOT be able to otherwise get, just from taping the shows off of TV broadcasts. So DVD manufacturers should include at least a few extras like bloopers, or cast member interviews, or deleted scenes, or SOMETHING to make it worth buying a DVD set. Even cheaper priced DVD sets (likeFull HouseandWho's the Boss?) have some special features which generally are part of the allure of buying a DVD set. I mean seriously, something, anything would be nice. Deleted scenes, bloopers, outtakes, interviews with the cast and crew. Something. Anything. Just some extras to make it worth the price.In any case, I still highly recommend this DVD set to every 7th Heaven fan. But those who don't know about, or have never seen 7th Heaven should first watch some of this show's episodes on TV - either the new episodes on Monday night at 8 PM (EST) on the WB, or the syndicated episodes at 6 PM (EST) weekdays, on the ABC Family channel before buying this DVD - just to make sure it is a show they'd like to have in their collection.I LOVE 7th Heaven!! My favorite episodes in this season are, ""With a Little Help from My Friends"", when Matt, in trying to secretly help an elderly neighbor, gets into trouble for skipping school, ""America's Most Wanted"", when Mary takes a glass from a local diner as part of an initiation ritual for her high-school basketball team and Matt, who in trying to protect her, takes the rap & gets arrested for petty theft, and ""Brave New World"", where Mary is being bullied and sexually harassed by a classmate.In spite of the lack of scene indexes or special features on this DVD set, I still LOVE it!!
