283935,A1IE7D4HZP43E7,6301973135,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","&#34;Of Human Bondage&#34; is a difficult book and movie largely because Maugham was a difficult person and this work was largely autobiographical.Like the earlier movie version with Leslie Howard and Bette Davis, this version deals only lightly with the extensive back story of the protagonist, Philip Carey, adequately played by Laurence Harvey; but like the earlier version the story focuses on the most striking theme of the book, Carey's obsession with a low-class waitress, Mildred Rogers, played by the always attractive and very talented Kim Novak.Carey is a medical student born with a club foot that somewhat limits his activities and choice of professions. He is much more concerned with this than most of the people about him, but he is mostly comfortable with his normal dealings with people.A friend of his in medical school would like to meet a certain waitress, Mildred, but is too shy to approach her, and Phillip agrees to help him meet her. When we first see Mildred, we find someone pretty and flirty and apparently very good fun. When she makes up to another patron (who will figure later in the story) the young man starts to get the message that she is not for him. Phillip flirts with her on his friend's behalf and her reaction puts the coffin nail in the friend's romantic hopes.Phillip nevertheless begins to desire her, an attraction that leads to obsession and misery for Phillip. When he has her she never gives him the security and satisfaction he longs for. When she leaves him for other lovers he is devastated but also relieved to have the opportunity to break from her emotionally, yet when she comes back he drops all else for her.Though the movie stands on its own as an entertainment and could perhaps earn five stars on that account, a few deviations from the book and the Howard/Davis movie are worth notice. The book makes Phillip's attraction to this waitress almost inexplicable: Phillip finds her unattractive: too thin, too flat-chested, too narrow-hipped; her only saving physical grace is a &#34;an attractive profile&#34; which might be considered pretty. On top of that, she is utterly cold to Phillip; she only hooks up with him in order to enjoy the good times he offers her. His growing obsession for this woman is explained as obsessive love fueled by his efforts to win her and the emotional rewards gained by her spare kind responses. Bette Davis carried this off very well, and you could feel the tension in Leslie Howard's loving misery. In this version, Where Bette Davis's Mildred was a woman who valued men for how much fun, possessions, and future security she thought she could get, Kim Novak's Mildred is simply promiscuous. Where Davis was hard and distant to Phillip's importunings, Novak is pretty, flirtatious and fun with Phillip; we don't have to guess why he becomes attached to her.  Even Mildred's signature putdown, responding to Phillip's offers to take her out and continue seeing her with &#34;I don't mind&#34; is softened by having her accept his advancing with a happy &#34;yes&#34; barely blunted by &#34;I don't mind.&#34;This is easier to watch than the Bette Davis movie; the harsh story softened enough to be enjoyable. Both movies are only a cut out of the book as a whole, which includes much more about Phillip and the people he lives with and through and explains much of his obsessions. However, I give you two caveats: the book is long and sometimes tedious--more for those who HAVE to know more or for the confirmed literature buff; and you may learn more than you really want to know about the largely unsympathetic Phillip, and about Somerset Maugham.",4,Another Interpretation of Somerset Maugham's Signature Work,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,3644,"['34', 'Human', 'Bondage', '34', 'difficult', 'book', 'movie', 'largely', 'Maugham', 'was', 'difficult', 'person', 'work', 'was', 'largely', 'earlier', 'movie', 'version', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'version', 'only', 'lightly', 'extensive', 'back', 'story', 'protagonist', 'Philip', 'Carey', 'adequately', 'played', 'Laurence', 'Harvey', 'earlier', 'version', 'story', 'most', 'striking', 'theme', 'book', 'Carey', 'obsession', 'low-class', 'waitress', 'Mildred', 'Rogers', 'played', 'always', 'attractive', 'very', 'talented', 'Kim', 'Novak.Carey', 'medical', 'student', 'born', 'club', 'foot', 'activities', 'choice', 'professions', 'much', 'more', 'concerned', 'most', 'people', 'mostly', 'comfortable', 'normal', 'dealings', 'people.A', 'friend', 'medical', 'school', 'would', 'like', 'meet', 'certain', 'waitress', 'Mildred', 'too', 'shy', 'approach', 'Phillip', 'help', 'meet', 'When', 'first', 'see', 'Mildred', 'find', 'someone', 'pretty', 'flirty', 'apparently', 'very', 'good', 'fun', 'When', 'up', 'patron', 'who', 'will', 'figure', 'later', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'get', 'message', 'not', 'Phillip', 'friend', 'behalf', 'reaction', 'coffin', 'nail', 'friend', 'romantic', 'hopes.Phillip', 'nevertheless', 'desire', 'attraction', 'obsession', 'misery', 'Phillip', 'When', 'never', 'security', 'satisfaction', 'When', 'other', 'lovers', 'devastated', 'also', 'relieved', 'have', 'opportunity', 'break', 'emotionally', 'yet', 'when', 'back', 'else', 'movie', 'own', 'entertainment', 'could', 'perhaps', 'earn', 'five', 'stars', 'account', 'few', 'deviations', 'book', 'Howard/Davis', 'movie', 'are', 'worth', 'notice', 'book', 'Phillip', 'attraction', 'waitress', 'almost', 'inexplicable', 'Phillip', 'unattractive', 'too', 'thin', 'too', 'flat-chested', 'too', 'narrow-hipped', 'only', 'saving', 'physical', 'grace', '34', 'attractive', 'profile', '34', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'pretty', 'top', 'utterly', 'cold', 'Phillip', 'only', 'up', 'order', 'enjoy', 'good', 'times', 'growing', 'obsession', 'woman', 'explained', 'obsessive', 'love', 'fueled', 'efforts', 'win', 'emotional', 'rewards', 'gained', 'spare', 'kind', 'responses', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'carried', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'feel', 'tension', 'Leslie', 'Howard', 'loving', 'misery', 'version', 'Where', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Mildred', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'valued', 'men', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'possessions', 'future', 'security', 'thought', 'could', 'get', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'Mildred', 'simply', 'promiscuous', 'Where', 'Davis', 'was', 'hard', 'distant', 'Phillip', 'importunings', 'Novak', 'pretty', 'flirtatious', 'fun', 'Phillip', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'guess', 'why', 'attached', 'Even', 'Mildred', 'signature', 'putdown', 'responding', 'Phillip', 'offers', 'take', 'out', 'continue', 'seeing', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', '34', 'softened', 'having', 'accept', 'advancing', 'happy', '34', '34', 'barely', 'blunted', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind.', '34', 'easier', 'watch', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'movie', 'harsh', 'story', 'softened', 'enough', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'movies', 'are', 'only', 'cut', 'book', 'whole', 'much', 'more', 'Phillip', 'people', 'much', 'obsessions', 'However', 'give', 'two', 'caveats', 'book', 'long', 'sometimes', 'tedious', 'more', 'who', 'HAVE', 'know', 'more', 'confirmed', 'literature', 'buff', 'may', 'learn', 'more', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'largely', 'unsympathetic', 'Phillip', 'Somerset', 'Maugham']",N/A

283943,A24GLNOGCWICTP,6301973135,Neil Cotiaux,"[8, 9]","In this, the third film version of Somerset Maugham's masterpiece, a colleague hovering over a corpse in medical school turns to Philip (played by Laurence Harvey) and warns him: If you get bloody, clean yourself up quickly. Good advice for a future doctor, and also for a protagonist with a feeling of inadequacy (club foot) and a penchant for throwing himself time and again at a lover who's also insecure (social status) and with a penchant for tearing him down.Philip and Mildred's respective insecurity manifests itself in opposite ways. While Philip seeks to take hold of Mildred and adjust her as he would the body of a patient (note his words to her in front of the skeleton that graces his apartment), Mildred careens from client to client seeking temporary adulation, a quick fix for her unease in dealing with men. (Her job as a waitress also allows for a bump-and-run approach to relationships.) Philip tries to get ""under her skin"" as he examines what makes her tick; Mildred merely seeks the company of an otherwise handsome ""gentleman"" whose physical deficiency is not readily apparent. In the end, as the two head obsessively to the emotional precipice, only one proves capable of self-control. Belatedly, Philip cleans himself up, and in the knick of time, in a manner that allows him to slowly transition to the next phase of his life with greater self-respect and understanding, if not unrestrained passion.This third version of Maugham's classic focuses squarely on the personalities of the main characters, locking out many of the supporting personalities in the novel, and all the better to allow Novak the latitude to display the full range of her art. Dressed in Victorian era garb, her natural beauty is, at times, somewhat diminished, but that in itself adds to the portrayal of blind obsession that Philip feels toward her. Her take on this working class tart is uncannily good; note how she looks plaintively at the waiter at the upscale restaurant that Philip takes her to, extending her wine glass and waiting for the pour, not understanding that Philip must taste for approval. As in ""Vertigo"", her eyes and minor physical movements say a lot. And when she lies in bed for the last time, hazily, her understated persona is spot-on. It's perhaps the finest work of her career, and Oscar-worthy.With a wonderful score, carefully chosen scenery, and appropriate lighting in addition to a standout performance by Novak, this ""Of Human Bondage"" deserves the widest possible audience.",5,Oscar-worthy Performance by Novak,1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,2509,"['third', 'film', 'version', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'masterpiece', 'colleague', 'hovering', 'corpse', 'medical', 'school', 'turns', 'Philip', 'played', 'Laurence', 'Harvey', 'get', 'bloody', 'clean', 'up', 'quickly', 'Good', 'advice', 'future', 'doctor', 'also', 'protagonist', 'feeling', 'inadequacy', 'club', 'foot', 'penchant', 'throwing', 'time', 'again', 'lover', 'who', 'also', 'insecure', 'social', 'status', 'penchant', 'tearing', 'down.Philip', 'Mildred', 'respective', 'insecurity', 'manifests', 'opposite', 'ways', 'Philip', 'take', 'hold', 'Mildred', 'adjust', 'would', 'body', 'patient', 'note', 'words', 'front', 'skeleton', 'apartment', 'Mildred', 'client', 'client', 'seeking', 'temporary', 'adulation', 'quick', 'fix', 'unease', 'dealing', 'men', 'job', 'waitress', 'also', 'bump-and-run', 'approach', 'relationships', 'Philip', 'get', 'skin', 'what', 'tick', 'Mildred', 'merely', 'company', 'otherwise', 'handsome', 'gentleman', 'physical', 'deficiency', 'not', 'readily', 'apparent', 'end', 'two', 'head', 'obsessively', 'emotional', 'precipice', 'only', 'one', 'capable', 'self-control', 'Belatedly', 'Philip', 'up', 'knick', 'time', 'manner', 'slowly', 'transition', 'next', 'phase', 'life', 'greater', 'self-respect', 'understanding', 'not', 'unrestrained', 'passion.This', 'third', 'version', 'Maugham', 'classic', 'squarely', 'personalities', 'main', 'characters', 'locking', 'out', 'many', 'supporting', 'personalities', 'novel', 'better', 'allow', 'Novak', 'latitude', 'display', 'full', 'range', 'art', 'Dressed', 'Victorian', 'era', 'garb', 'natural', 'beauty', 'times', 'somewhat', 'diminished', 'portrayal', 'blind', 'obsession', 'Philip', 'take', 'working', 'class', 'tart', 'uncannily', 'good', 'note', 'how', 'plaintively', 'waiter', 'upscale', 'restaurant', 'Philip', 'extending', 'wine', 'glass', 'waiting', 'pour', 'not', 'understanding', 'Philip', 'must', 'taste', 'approval', 'Vertigo', 'eyes', 'minor', 'physical', 'movements', 'say', 'lot', 'when', 'bed', 'last', 'time', 'hazily', 'understated', 'persona', 'spot-on', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'work', 'career', 'Oscar-worthy.With', 'wonderful', 'score', 'carefully', 'chosen', 'scenery', 'appropriate', 'lighting', 'addition', 'standout', 'performance', 'Novak', 'Human', 'Bondage', 'widest', 'possible', 'audience']",N/A
