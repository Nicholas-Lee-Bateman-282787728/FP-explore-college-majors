1502393,AW135H6P4JXKC,B005SH65GI,buckbooks,"[8, 13]","This long, tedious adventure from the tail end of Doctor Who's first season displays a cast beginning to show signs of fatigue; William Hartnell fluffs his lines so badly that if you turn on the subtitles you'll see it's not your imagination: he really is speaking perfect gibberish. And the mediocre Special Features the BBC includes with this disc do nothing to redeem the package.The Doctor, Susan, Ian and Barbara land aboard a spaceship orbiting a mysterious planet called the Sense-Sphere. Members of the crew appear dead but are actually being kept in a state of paralysis to prevent them from escaping to Earth with news of their discovery. The Sensorites, a mild-mannered race that communicates telepathically, fear that invaders from Earth will ravage their planet for its mineral resources (an earlier expedition tried to do just that). Meanwhile, the Sensorites are dying of a strange, new illness that strikes Ian, too, after he drinks the planet's water. The Doctor suspects poisoning and promises to find an antidote if the Sensorites will return the lock they've stolen from his TARDIS.In addition to the interminably boring six-episode script, ""The Sensorites"" has a lot of production factors working against it. The nearly faceless Sensorites all look and act alike, making it difficult to recognize characters as distinct individuals (the planet's population apparently consists solely of gray-haired old men). Their mouths don't really move when they speak, but if they did you wouldn't see it anyway because their beards grow in all directions, sometimes covering their mouths. The Sensorites are gentle creatures who cower whenever the Doctor (who towers over them by at least three inches) so much as raises his voice. Thus, they never provide the credible shock this story so badly needs. The sets are drab, with wall panels that wobble and sometimes swing open whenever the actors pass through a nearby door.Little is remembered about the making of ""The Sensorites,"" so the disc doesn't bother to include the customary making-of documentary. Instead, stand-up comedian Toby Hadoke burns 21 minutes of screen time tracing the story's enigmatic script writer, Peter R. Newman. A brief interview with vision mixer Clive Doig offers only momentary glimpses behind the scenes of this ground-breaking series during its inaugural season.

I first got this one on VHS in the ""End of the Universe"" collection and I found it quite enjoyable. I'm surprised that it took this long to be released on DVD.Let me get the bad stuff out of the way first. Episode 3 was kind of boring, but it picks up again in episode 4. There are many stuttered lines in this story. The Sensorites feet look ridiculous. And at one point, you even see a wall in the spaceship start to fall down before it is quickly put back up again. But other than that, this is a great story.The acting was pretty good - some of it was actually brilliant. The sets look great. The dark spaceship was very spooky as well as the aqueduct on the Sense-Sphere. The Sensorites were very creepy in the first two episodes. Episode 1's cliffhanger was, in my opinion, one of the best in the series. The plot and the story are great. It has a lot of mystery and adventure in it. It has a great surprise ending, and I really enjoyed Susan's character a lot more in this story than in others. Her character should have been like this from the beginning. This is also the very first story that has the Doctor himself taking on the heroic role instead of Ian, and he uses his mind and wits to defeat the enemy instead of brute force. I really enjoyed this one and I'm sure you will as well.

1502399,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,B005SH65GI,Little Roy Blue,"[3, 3]","This is definitely a minority opinion, but I think the first season of Doctor Who was the best. William Hartnell's sinister characterization of the Doctor is very underrated, and he was well-supported by excellent companions - particularly Ian and Barbara, who are the most convincing representations of ""normal"" people in the show's history. Sure, the Doctor's granddaughter Susan was a criminally under-used character; but here in The Sensorites, she gets to shine a little by defying the Doctor's wishes and using some cool telepathic powers.I'm also a fan of season one because of the (generally) great scripts. And while The Sensorites is far from the best-written story of the season, I do think that Peter R. Newman's script features some compelling ideas. In defiance of Doctor Who conventions, Newman depicted the Sensorite race as mostly benign and sympathetic creatures (an interesting contrast to the show's usual ""evil monster"" aliens); indeed, the Sensorites only do ""bad things"" in this story in order to protect their planet from exploitation by humans who want to strip-mine the place. In a sense, then, this is the sort of left-wing (or at least politically aware) story that didn't become commonplace for Doctor Who until the Pertwee era.The story's production design, meanwhile, is pretty good (given the era and budget). The Sensorites may look a little fake, but to me they're perfectly respectable aliens by 1960s TV standards; certainly, Doctor Who produced much stupider-looking aliens even in the 1980s (like the Ergon, to name one of many). Also, the set design for the human spaceship is effective, and enhances the tense and claustrophobic atmosphere of the opening episodes. Unfortunately, both the set design and the pace of the story take a bad turn once the action shifts to the Sensorite planet, but the drop in quality is not nearly as bad as some critics suggest.In short, The Sensorites is an interesting story that lacks energy sometimes; it's not a classic, but it deserves to enjoy a somewhat better reputation. Unfortunately, given the lowly status of this tale in the Doctor Who canon, the BBC didn't put too much effort into giving us a great DVD. The special features, though not bad, are rather thin. The most interesting featurette involves Doctor Who fan Toby Hadoke investigating Peter R. Newman's background; he uncovers a surprising amount about the little-known writer, including some genuinely emotional material. Unfortunately, this feature is undermined slightly by Hadoke's snarky ""I'm a self-aware sci-fi geek"" persona. Also featured is a short interview with Doctor Who's vision mixer, which is less boring than it sounds.While I wish I could give this DVD four stars, the presentation is pretty bare-bones and the actual story has a few flaws. So I'll settle for three stars, but it's more like three-and-a-half. If this is arguably the worst story of Who's first season, that's a testament to how strong the era really was.",3,"Underrated story, slightly blah DVD",1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,2982,"['definitely', 'minority', 'opinion', 'think', 'first', 'season', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'was', 'best', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'sinister', 'characterization', 'Doctor', 'very', 'underrated', 'was', 'well-supported', 'excellent', 'companions', 'particularly', 'Ian', 'Barbara', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'convincing', 'representations', 'normal', 'people', 'show', 'history', 'Sure', 'Doctor', 'granddaughter', 'Susan', 'was', 'criminally', 'under-used', 'character', 'here', 'Sensorites', 'shine', 'little', 'defying', 'Doctor', 'wishes', 'using', 'cool', 'telepathic', 'powers.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'fan', 'season', 'one', 'generally', 'great', 'scripts', 'Sensorites', 'far', 'best-written', 'story', 'season', 'do', 'think', 'Peter', 'R.', 'Newman', 'script', 'compelling', 'ideas', 'defiance', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'conventions', 'Newman', 'depicted', 'Sensorite', 'race', 'mostly', 'benign', 'sympathetic', 'creatures', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'show', 'usual', 'evil', 'monster', 'aliens', 'indeed', 'Sensorites', 'only', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'story', 'order', 'protect', 'planet', 'exploitation', 'humans', 'who', 'want', 'strip-mine', 'place', 'sense', 'then', 'sort', 'left-wing', 'least', 'politically', 'aware', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'commonplace', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Pertwee', 'era.The', 'story', 'production', 'design', 'meanwhile', 'pretty', 'good', 'given', 'era', 'budget', 'Sensorites', 'may', 'look', 'little', 'fake', ""'re"", 'perfectly', 'respectable', 'aliens', '1960s', 'TV', 'standards', 'certainly', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'produced', 'much', 'stupider-looking', 'aliens', 'even', '1980s', 'Ergon', 'name', 'one', 'many', 'Also', 'set', 'design', 'human', 'spaceship', 'effective', 'tense', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'opening', 'episodes', 'Unfortunately', 'set', 'design', 'pace', 'story', 'take', 'bad', 'turn', 'action', 'shifts', 'Sensorite', 'planet', 'drop', 'quality', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'suggest.In', 'short', 'Sensorites', 'interesting', 'story', 'energy', 'sometimes', 'not', 'classic', 'enjoy', 'somewhat', 'better', 'reputation', 'Unfortunately', 'given', 'lowly', 'status', 'tale', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'BBC', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'giving', 'great', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'rather', 'thin', 'most', 'interesting', 'featurette', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fan', 'Toby', 'Hadoke', 'investigating', 'Peter', 'R.', 'Newman', 'background', 'surprising', 'amount', 'little-known', 'writer', 'including', 'genuinely', 'emotional', 'material', 'Unfortunately', 'feature', 'undermined', 'slightly', 'Hadoke', 'snarky', ""'m"", 'self-aware', 'sci-fi', 'geek', 'persona', 'Also', 'featured', 'short', 'interview', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'vision', 'mixer', 'less', 'boring', 'sounds.While', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'DVD', 'four', 'stars', 'presentation', 'pretty', 'bare-bones', 'actual', 'story', 'few', 'flaws', 'So', ""'ll"", 'settle', 'three', 'stars', 'more', 'three-and-a-half', 'arguably', 'worst', 'story', 'Who', 'first', 'season', 'testament', 'how', 'strong', 'era', 'really', 'was']","Doctor Who: The Sensorites, No. 7"

In the end I decided to round up because of my extreme fondness for the William Hartnell era of Doctor Who.A major benefit to this story is the growth of Susan Foreman.  In the previous four stories her character is overly dramatic and incessantly whiny.  With no strength of will or character she fit the mold of &#34;damsel in distress&#34; too often for an intergalatic traveler.  In this story Carol Anne Ford had been able to play the character Susan should have been from the start.  Willing to take risks and unafraid of the unknown.  She is not afraid of the Sensorites, attempts to take matters into her own hand, and begins to realize that she has extraordinary telepathic abilities.(I'm reminded of Wesley Crusher from Star Trek: The Next Generation.  Incredibly whiny, but in the end the character becomes intriguing and wonderful.  Like Susan, he too has a strange &#34;otherworldly&#34; gift.)Another benefit is that it's a good old fashion look into human emotions of fear and trust.  It takes philosophical questions about humanity, and attempts to answer them in a sci-fi setting.  This is the way Sci-Fi should be.Jacqueline Hill unfortunately goes on vacation during this serial, so Barbara is not as active.  This is forgivable, as it was custom to shoot film this way back then.  One of my complaints is the off-scene ending confrontation with the City Administrator.  The serial deals with his fear and xenophobia, but does not get to hear an ending speech from him or a suitable confrontation.  Another is my complaint with the character Maitland.  Dialogue suggests an intriguing relationship triangle with him, Carol, and John ... but this is never touched on again and the subject is never resolved.Overall though, the growth and maturity of Susan's character is reason enough to buy this story.",5,Sensorites is a 4.5 Story,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,1887,"['wanted', 'take', 'star', 'off', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'allow', 'end', 'decided', 'round', 'up', 'extreme', 'fondness', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'era', 'Doctor', 'Who.A', 'major', 'benefit', 'story', 'growth', 'Susan', 'Foreman', 'previous', 'four', 'stories', 'character', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'incessantly', 'whiny', 'strength', 'will', 'character', 'fit', 'mold', '34', 'damsel', 'distress', '34', 'too', 'often', 'intergalatic', 'traveler', 'story', 'Carol', 'Anne', 'Ford', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'play', 'character', 'Susan', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'start', 'Willing', 'take', 'risks', 'unafraid', 'unknown', 'not', 'afraid', 'Sensorites', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hand', 'realize', 'extraordinary', 'telepathic', 'abilities', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'Wesley', 'Crusher', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Incredibly', 'whiny', 'end', 'character', 'intriguing', 'wonderful', 'Susan', 'too', 'strange', '34', 'otherworldly', '34', 'gift', 'benefit', 'good', 'old', 'fashion', 'look', 'human', 'emotions', 'fear', 'trust', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'humanity', 'attempts', 'answer', 'sci-fi', 'setting', 'way', 'Sci-Fi', 'should', 'be.Jacqueline', 'Hill', 'unfortunately', 'vacation', 'serial', 'so', 'Barbara', 'not', 'active', 'forgivable', 'was', 'custom', 'shoot', 'film', 'way', 'back', 'then', 'One', 'complaints', 'off-scene', 'ending', 'confrontation', 'City', 'Administrator', 'serial', 'deals', 'fear', 'xenophobia', 'not', 'get', 'hear', 'ending', 'speech', 'suitable', 'confrontation', 'complaint', 'character', 'Maitland', 'Dialogue', 'intriguing', 'relationship', 'triangle', 'Carol', 'John', 'never', 'touched', 'again', 'subject', 'never', 'resolved.Overall', 'growth', 'maturity', 'Susan', 'character', 'reason', 'enough', 'buy', 'story']","Doctor Who: The Sensorites, No. 7"
1502401,A2QO4P5SGAZYI8,B005SH65GI,Nancy A. Fox,"[1, 2]","The Sensorites commits the biggest sin that any Doctor Who story can commit: it's dull. Stretched out over 6 episodes with very little actually happening, it seems to last forever. However, it's not without a few good points.In brief, the TARDIS lands on a spaceship where the human crew is kept in a state of suspended animation. The Sensorites, or native population of the planet the ship is orbiting, are keeping the crew in a state of suspended animation so that the humans won't let anyone know about the valuable mineral to be found on the Sense-sphere. The TARDIS crew, sans Barbara, and most of the human spaceship crew are taken down to the Sense-sphere where political intrigue, plotting, racism and misunderstandings flow.On the positive side: This is a terrific story for the character of Susan. She isn't merely a hysterical teenager, and she seems to have telepathic powers that her grandfather doesn't have. I also thought it was interesting to have a species where individualism is so devalued that the only way they can tell each other apart is from details of their clothing. A couple of the guest actors do a nice job, and there are some nice set designs that unfortunately don't always make it to the screen.On the bad side: Did I mention that the story is dull? It's too long, but even if it had only been 3 or 4 episodes it probably would have dragged a bit. There's also a lot of holes in the plot: If the Sensorites are so sensitive to darkness, why are they o.k. traveling through space in a bubble? If the Sensorites have the ability to keep the human crew basically comatose, why couldn't they have wiped the human's memories of the rare mineral? Etc., Etc.For the extras, let's just say that it doesn't speak highly of any of them that my favorite extra was the photo gallery. The commentary featured a large rotating cast that seemed to keep having less and less to do with Doctor Who as the episodes progressed. I recognize that with some of the oldest stories there are fewer people still around, but I think they were scraping the bottom of the barrel by episode 6. I wish they'd let Carole Ann Ford stay for a few more episodes. I thought she had some very interesting things to say about what she thought the direction of the Susan character should have been. William Russell was pleasant with a few interesting memories, as always. I also enjoyed Joe Greig who played a number of the Sensorites, he turned out to be quite a character and he added a number of pithy comments along the way. The info-text was o.k. There was no making of featurette, instead Toby Hadoke went searching for the ""elusive"" author of the story. It was sort of interesting, but not that special.Personally, I would have enjoyed seeing an omnibus version of this story. If it had been edited down to a 1 and a half hour movie, the pacing probably would have been better. However, that's not an option.So, should you buy it?

If you don't know it by now, you're not going to learn about it from me.I highly anticipated this release, being a big fan of William Hartnell, but apart from seeing the wonderfully restored picture and audio, I was then faced with one disappointment after another upon viewing the ""special features"", which, in my opinion, is one of the reasons as to why anyone would buy this, or any, DVD.  The best thing about this is that the picture has been greatly cleaned up. Also, the text commentary was insightful.  Sadly, that's were my happiness for this ends.  The audio commentary isn't bad, but I'm just so damned tired of Toby Hadoke moderating these. In my humble opinion, commentaries were better when the people who were directly involved spoke their minds, instead of being directed for an answer by some *..!, who had nothing to do with the show when it was produced.  This silicone sack of vinegar and water needs to go.  In addition, the few specials were dismally poor.MY BOTTOM LINE: This is a good story being of its time, and a MUST HAVE for any fan of the classic series.  Having the video cleaned up and refined is wonderful, but other than that, there is little more to appreciate about this release.  2|entertain needs to work on giving more to the customers for their money, and respect their intelligence instead of thumbing their nose at them and thinking that their customers are ignorant and easily appeased.If you have any questions or comments on this review, please feel free to post them.
