I can't venture to say that Holly Ceroni's life is down in the dumps exactly, because she still has her great kid, Max (Mitchell Kummen), to brighten her up. But life in Michigan could better be. Holly (Elizabeth Berkley) is a single mom and a gourmet chef, and times are tough. Max's weasel of a dad scarpered off some time ago but not before emptying out their bank account and motoring off with the car, never to be heard from since. Holly dreams of running her own cafe with room above for an apartment. Today, Holly holds down three jobs to make ends meet, waitressing and hostessing and none of it gourmet chefing. She and Max are tenants living in an attic, and Holly, in lieu of paying rent she can't afford, instead cooks meals for her old landlords. She drives a miserable '91 Volvo. Soon, she's not even driving that.So, yeah, Holly has serious trust issues. I'm surprised she even took a chance entering into the Christmas lottery. It's a contest that promises a million dollar winner each week from Thanksgiving to Christmas eve. She recites her set of numbers: 21-07-12-11-06-15. Good luck, Holly. What's she got to lose, eh?And then there's Mike Ronowski (Jason Gray-Stanford) and his loser pal, Joe (Mike Bell), whom we first meet as they fling into a metal bin of fire memorabilia of Joe's time with his ex (see, she's tossed him out and he's feeling sorry for himself). Mike and Joe are construction workers and - look! - that metal bin of fire and memorabilia just went out of control and burned down the house they were working on. From the first few seconds on, I was screaming for Mike to drop his loser pal. Except Mike is a stand-up guy, the poor bastard. Mike is an aspiring architect; he's got mad skills in that field. He dreams of putting up sustainable structures. But the family construction business stands in the way. Also, his loser pal, Joe, keeps dragging him down. Mike, please drop that loser friend! Guy's even wormed his way into bunking in with you.Lucky Christmas (2011) is about a poverty-stricken young mother whose car - with the winning lottery ticket inside the glove compartment - is stolen by some loser and his ailing pal (I'm not naming names, but you work out the math). The ailing pal is the one alloted with a conscience and he means to straight away return the car and the ticket, except there wouldn't be a movie now, would there? The plot conspires to erect obstacles in Mike's way, and so here's him with his rotten pal trying to sweet talk him into keeping the lottery ticket and here's him with the wrong impression of Holly. Days elapse, and Mike inches closer to confessing to Holly - yes, he's arranged an accidental meet - except, now, he's falling in love with her and he likes her kid and so, now, a whole new set of obstacles is erected. Aargh, Mike's pal is so annoying and creepy, and will Holly get back her lottery ticket in time? She's got until Christmas eve to cash it in. This movie cuts it close. Good acting. Cute romance. Some comic moments. Several warm moments. Antics with ice hockey and pinewood derby and why you should always check the bottom of your shoe.

1554338,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B008IG0GDE,J. Olsen,"[33, 36]","Holly Ceroni is a single mom who is aspiring to be a chef, but has to resort to waitressing several jobs to support herself and her son. They board in the attic room of an elderly couple in a large, old home. She cooks for them to help pay her way, and she buys a lottery ticket regularly, hoping to win the money to make the dream of her own cafe come true. She drives an old car, but at least it gets her around--until she meets a girlfriend one night at a local bar & grill. As they leave the place she discovers that her car is missing, apparently stolen. On top of that, when she returns home she learns that the lottery ticket she had recently purchased is a winner, and it is in the glove box of her stolen car.Cut to Mike. He is an architect in sustainable (green) building, who was trying to establish his own business. He left it all behind when his Dad had health issues and had to retire from the family construction business. Mike came home to lend a hand to his brother, Bob, who stepped in to run the family company. He currently has an old friend (Joe) rooming with him since he was dumped by his wife/girlfriend (?it never really says which?) for being a slob--which he is, big time! Mike and Joe had been at the same bar & grill as Holly and her friend, at the same time. Mike was not feeling well--a side effect from an earlier incident caused by Joe. He asks Joe to take him home as his symptoms get worse. When they get to the parking lot they see that Joe's truck has a ""boot"" for tickets unpaid. Mike is doubled over and only semi-aware by this time. Joe finds a set of keys in the parking lot near his tire, which Holly had unknowingly dropped earlier as she bumped into someone in the parking lot. Joe hits the button on the key fob and Holly's car lights blink. He loads the oblivious Mike into Holly's car, telling him it is a loaner and he will return it just as soon as he gets Mike home. Instead, Mike is asleep by the time they arrive home, so Joe leaves him in the car and goes in the house to sleep. Come morning, Mike is appalled to learn what Joe did and is insisting on doing the right thing. It gets complicated when they see an interview on the news where Holly tells about her stolen car and the ticket in the glove box. Joe tries to convince Mike to keep the ticket, but Mike leaves the car on a street and has Joe call a tip into the local news so that the car will be found. Then he learns that Joe has taken the ticket from the glove box. He sets out to try and find a way to give it back to Holly in person without getting arrested. Joe helps him figure out a way to get to know Holly and the chemistry between them is obvious. And Holly's son, Max takes to Mike immediately.Of course, things don't go smoothly. There are plenty of bumps in the road, some that make it interesting and some that are just hard to believe (what scout troop has a pinewood derby on Christmas Eve?). Along the way you can see that Mike is really a nice guy, Holly really wants to trust him, Max is desperate for a good male role model in his life, and Bob, Mike's brother, has deeper issues than just the money that Joe's stupid moves cost the company.Most of the time I liked this movie. I'm not a fan of lotteries, or of the very occasional ""potty language"" or rare use of the Lord's name as an exclamation. There isn't anything suggestive or inappropriate in Holly and Mike's relationship. I did like the way most of the characters were good people trying to help others (except for Joe), and the importance of family did seem to be central to much of the story. It was a fun chick flick--don't expect the men in your life to be drawn to it, unless Joe is their kind of guy.",4,Entertaining Holiday Chick Flick,1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,3700,"['Holly', 'Ceroni', 'single', 'mom', 'who', 'aspiring', 'be', 'chef', 'resort', 'waitressing', 'several', 'jobs', 'support', 'son', 'board', 'attic', 'room', 'elderly', 'couple', 'large', 'old', 'home', 'help', 'pay', 'way', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'regularly', 'hoping', 'win', 'money', 'make', 'dream', 'own', 'cafe', 'come', 'true', 'old', 'car', 'least', 'around', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'night', 'local', 'bar', 'grill', 'leave', 'place', 'car', 'missing', 'apparently', 'stolen', 'top', 'when', 'home', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'had', 'recently', 'purchased', 'winner', 'glove', 'box', 'stolen', 'car.Cut', 'Mike', 'architect', 'sustainable', 'green', 'building', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'establish', 'own', 'business', 'left', 'when', 'Dad', 'had', 'health', 'issues', 'had', 'retire', 'family', 'construction', 'business', 'Mike', 'came', 'home', 'lend', 'hand', 'brother', 'Bob', 'who', 'stepped', 'run', 'family', 'company', 'currently', 'old', 'friend', 'Joe', 'rooming', 'was', 'dumped', 'wife/girlfriend', 'never', 'really', 'being', 'slob', 'big', 'time', 'Mike', 'Joe', 'had', 'been', 'same', 'bar', 'grill', 'Holly', 'friend', 'same', 'time', 'Mike', 'was', 'not', 'feeling', 'well', 'side', 'effect', 'earlier', 'incident', 'caused', 'Joe', 'Joe', 'take', 'home', 'symptoms', 'get', 'worse', 'When', 'get', 'parking', 'lot', 'see', 'Joe', 'truck', 'boot', 'tickets', 'unpaid', 'Mike', 'doubled', 'only', 'semi-aware', 'time', 'Joe', 'set', 'keys', 'parking', 'lot', 'tire', 'Holly', 'had', 'unknowingly', 'dropped', 'earlier', 'bumped', 'someone', 'parking', 'lot', 'Joe', 'button', 'key', 'fob', 'Holly', 'car', 'lights', 'blink', 'oblivious', 'Mike', 'Holly', 'car', 'telling', 'loaner', 'will', 'return', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'Mike', 'home', 'Instead', 'Mike', 'asleep', 'time', 'arrive', 'home', 'so', 'Joe', 'car', 'house', 'sleep', 'Come', 'morning', 'Mike', 'appalled', 'learn', 'what', 'Joe', 'did', 'insisting', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'complicated', 'when', 'see', 'interview', 'news', 'where', 'Holly', 'stolen', 'car', 'ticket', 'glove', 'box', 'Joe', 'convince', 'Mike', 'keep', 'ticket', 'Mike', 'car', 'street', 'Joe', 'call', 'tip', 'local', 'news', 'car', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'Then', 'Joe', 'taken', 'ticket', 'glove', 'box', 'out', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'give', 'back', 'Holly', 'person', 'getting', 'arrested', 'Joe', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'get', 'know', 'Holly', 'chemistry', 'obvious', 'Holly', 'son', 'Max', 'Mike', 'immediately.Of', 'course', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'smoothly', 'are', 'plenty', 'bumps', 'road', 'make', 'interesting', 'are', 'just', 'hard', 'believe', 'what', 'scout', 'troop', 'pinewood', 'derby', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'Mike', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'Holly', 'really', 'trust', 'Max', 'desperate', 'good', 'male', 'role', 'model', 'life', 'Bob', 'Mike', 'brother', 'deeper', 'issues', 'just', 'money', 'Joe', 'stupid', 'moves', 'cost', 'company.Most', 'time', 'liked', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'lotteries', 'very', 'occasional', 'potty', 'language', 'rare', 'use', 'Lord', 'name', 'exclamation', ""n't"", 'anything', 'suggestive', 'inappropriate', 'Holly', 'Mike', 'relationship', 'did', 'way', 'most', 'characters', 'were', 'good', 'people', 'trying', 'help', 'others', 'Joe', 'importance', 'family', 'did', 'seem', 'be', 'central', 'much', 'story', 'was', 'fun', 'chick', 'flick', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'men', 'life', 'be', 'drawn', 'Joe', 'kind', 'guy']",N/A
