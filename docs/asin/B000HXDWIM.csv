1017642,A1MMO3T0I18PFW,B000HXDWIM,Chris Roberts,"[6, 10]","The Good: By far and away, the standout aspect of ""The Ten Commandments: The Musical"" is the voices.  Every single female voice in the cast is absolutely spectacular.  Every time American Idol-er Adam Lambert sings you get goose bumps.  The only one in the whole cast that isn't acoustically jaw-dropping is Val Kilmer and even he's not really that bad (they wrote his part with about a 5-note range so it's pretty hard to screw up).  Everyone's very pretty for what that's worth.  I'm a huge fan of the idea of preserving musical theatre on DVD and wish there was more of a movement to do so.  I'd kill for OBC DVDs of productions like Rent, Wicked, or Mamma Mia!  Strangely, we get this short-lived, critically slammed number due to the presence of its star.  Oh well, I still applaud the preservation concept.  The camerawork is very good for a stage performance.The Bad: Sadly, just about everything else.  There are only key smatterings of the actual Biblical story; the audience is expected to already know the details and motivations of the characters.  It's tough to pull off a musical with no dialogue and they don't do it here - you never really learn about any of the characters because they never talk.  There are no standout songs.  Not a single track is memorable and I would challenge anyone to sing more than 3 lines from the whole show an hour after seeing it.  The lyrics are never great and very often terrible and the music is a tribute to 3-chord silliness on a Casio keyboard.  The cheesy, overlaid special effects are embarrassing.  The fact that they stop the Moses story halfway through and then start singing that we should be loving, nice people is just shmaltzy.The Unforgivable: Despite the packaging claims, this is NOT widescreen!!  It is a widescreen image letterboxed into a fullscreen presentation.  That means that on your 16:9 television it will only fill the middle parts of your screen.  This is 2009 and such terrible videography is just not okay.The Highlight: ""Is Anybody Listening"" by Adam Lambert.  That kid's got vocal pipes (he belongs on Broadway as a centrepiece to a much better show)!  How unfortunate that it finishes 20 minutes in and nothing in the play afterwards comes close to measuring up.The Verdict: You know, I totally get why people can't even make it through this DVD.  As musical theatre goes, it's not great.  As a DVD of musical theatre goes, it's even worse.  But I'm wild about theatre and the concept of putting it on DVD alone makes me love a DVD that preserves an original cast production.  The songs all suck, but I love hearing them because of the extraordinary vocals.  And hey, everyone's really, really pretty!  For a theatre-junkie like me, I wholeheartedly endorse buying this as an occasional indulgence.  If you're not big on musicals or theatre, then you'd probably be wise to steer clear or make it a curiosity-rental.

Hall ""Brgilesbernard""","[1, 2]","As well as the classical  theatre, I also have a passion for the ""Musical Theatre"" and when I saw this DVD of ""The Ten Commandments"" the musical; I thought that maybe it had gone too far.But curiosity finally got the best of me, so I purchased it to see for myself if it would work.After the first few minutes I was convinced that it did.What a conception, to take this movie masterpiece and turn it into a musical.My faith in the musical theatre was once again restored.I must commend the authors of this work; the composer Patrick Leonard and the lyricist Maribeth Derry for having the conviction to write this masterpiece.Supported by a staunch team, such as Giantito Burchellard's magnificent sets and Max Azira's brilliant costumes. The special effect were amazing as well and all competently directed by Dennis Rosenblatt.The cast is one of the best I have heard in many years. Headed off by Val Kilmer as Moses (I didn't know he could sing!)  what a voice. Then there is Adam lambert as Joshua, Kevin Errley as Ramses, Allison Porter as Miriam, Lawren Kennedy as Nefertari; Nicholas Rodriguez as Aaron; all excellent singer/actors.The staging at the Kodak theatre, Hollywood, was brilliant with the use of projection and it's many special effects including ""the burning bush, the writing of the 10 commandments and the plagues""; brilliant!!This is a must see musical and I endorse it completely. The songs alone are stand-out-hits on their own.

1017646,AGWVSPCJGWIEQ,B000HXDWIM,"Gretchen ""Theatre Lover""","[3, 6]","""The Ten Commandments: The Musical"" starring Val Kilmer as Moses, and features ADAM LAMBERT as Joshua, the man who succeeded Moses, and ultimately brought the Jews to the Promised Land, via Mount Sinai.Overall, I thought that Patrick Leonard, the composer, and Maribeth Derry, the lyricist, did an admirable job adapting The Exodus into a musical, once you contemplate the magnitude of the narrative.Considering that I know the story reasonably well, I have two rather significant complaints about the storyline.My first complaint is the fact that Joshua, portrayed by Adam Lambert, was not even ALIVE when the Exodus began. God told Moses that because no-one had enough faith to trust in God, every original person who physically left Egypt would die before they found the ""Promised Land."" Moses, Aaron, Miriam, and the entire original Hebrew nation walked in the desert for FORTY YEARS because of that. The first time we hear about Joshua in the Bible is when Moses picks Joshua with several other men to participate in a reconnaissance expedition to check out the land of Canaan from where they brought back grapes, pomegranates, and figs. Again, when Joshua first appeared onto the scene, it is about halfway through the book of Numbers, which is the Third Book of the Five Books of the Torah or the Pentateuch: Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. Moses was 80 when he implored Ramses to let the Hebrews leave Egypt, and 120 years old when he died, at the end of Deuteronomy. Based on that info, I would deduce Moses was about 100 years old when Joshua first appears.My second complaint is that one of the songs is chronologically incorrect, which would be ""The Horns of Jericho."" When the walls surrounding Jericho actually tumbled down, it was many years AFTER Moses' death.Other than that, I thought the show was truly entertaining!Act 1 begins with Seti, the Pharaoh who would become Moses' stepfather, commanding his soldiers to kill the firstborn son of each household, eventually bringing Moses into his own house. Moses and Ramses become adults, Moses' banishment, meeting his wife, talking to God through the burning bush, returning to Egypt and his eventual reunion with Ramses, pleading with Ramses to let the Hebrews leave, going through all the plagues, culminating with Ramses' son dying, and Ramses telling Moses that the Hebrews could finally leave Egypt, with his blessing.Act 2 begins with the Hebrews celebrating their freedom from Ramses, goes through the terror of Ramses coming after them to make them slaves again, the crossing of the Red Sea, creating the Golden Calf idol, and ends with Moses bringing down the Ten Commandments from God.Val Kilmer does a very nice job singing, especially since I knew he did his own singing when he portrayed `Jim Morrison' in Oliver Stone's movie, ""The Doors."" There were a couple of songs where Val speak-sings, similar to what Rex Harrison did in the movie ""My Fair Lady,"" but I put that more to the song itself, rather than Val's vocal techniques. In addition, when Moses confronts the Burning Bush, God speaks with such a weird robotic monotone voice, which I found to be rather peculiar, and not in a good way. I think that anyone attempting to do ""God's Voice,"" his voice should be dramatic and flowing, like Patrick Stewart, or James Earl Jones.There were a couple of scenes which were creatively staged that caught my attention. One happens in the beginning, where Moses' mother places baby Moses in the basket to float down the river, and Pharaoh's Wife draws Moses out of the river: a section of the stage floor disappears so it seems that a river is actually there! In addition, the scene when Moses is getting ready to part the Red Sea, so they can finally escape Pharaoh, is extremely inventive. I almost do not want to describe it, because I think it is worth seeing, and I honestly do not know if my description can do it justice.You can tell that they recorded the show specifically for this DVD presentation, as they use several cameras. As a result, some of the visual effects are rather obvious. Though certain lighting effects COULD have happened on stage, I am leaning on the side of post-production video editing. Despite that, I would have enjoyed seeing this particular show live, just so I could have something to compare. Someone on Amazon.com justly mentions how some of the lighting effects when the Pharaoh, Moses' stepfather, appears, he gives off this golden glow, which was extremely artificial. Of course, when the tablets featuring the Ten Commandments glow from behind, I appreciate the gravity of the moment, but again, it was rather cheesy.Adam, of course, does a WONDERFUL job as Joshua, and I can pick his voice out easily. Not only that, his character helps tell the story. Though ""Is Anybody Listening?"" is his principal solo as it is an entire song, he has many solos throughout the entire show. Considering the placement of this particular song, it is a major turning point in Moses' life.Close to the show's finale, the Hebrews did not believe that Moses was ever returning from on top of Mount Sinai, despite what Aaron and Mariam told them, so they created an idol out of gold, and began to worship it. Consequently, when Moses appears with the Ten Commandments, then seeing the riotous behavior surrounding the idol, Moses is furious and throws the tablets bearing the Ten Commandments onto the ground, shattering into several pieces.I think one of the most breathtaking moments of the entire show is when a young boy puts the pieces back together, and sings the Ten Commandments. He has such an angelic, Soprano voice, and sings with such innocence, one has to pause and actually listen to these basic laws that God gave the world. Might you remember Connie Talbot, the 6-year-old girl who sang ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" on `Britain's Got Talent"" a couple of years ago? There is such purity, and innocence, in a voice like that. The young boy who sings the Ten Commandments has a similar voice.One can purchase the DVD for under $10, which I think is worth the investment, as there are some entertaining bonuses on the DVD. One of them is the""Behind the Scenes"" which features the main cast being interviewed, but ADAM is asked a question, and in full costume! There is also a Photo Gallery of the show, and Adam's ""Is Anybody Listening?"" opens the photo gallery in its entirety.One thing that truly caught my eye about the total production of the show is that it was co-produced by Max Azria, who is THE Max Azria, of BCBG Max Azria! He also designed the costumes that the entire cast wore throughout the production.Alisan Porter, portrays Moses' sister Mariam, and she has a significant role, with many wonderful songs, and solos. I think most people would be familiar with Alisan as ""Curly Sue"" opposite Jim Belushi.Kevin Earley portrays Ramses, the man Moses ultimately confronts. He has been on Broadway for a few productions, such as ""Les Miserables,"" ""Thoroughly Modern Millie,"" and most recently ""A Tale of Two Cities."" I will have to check my Playbills, but I think I have seen Kevin in ""Thoroughly Modern Millie,"" and he did a spectacular job!Luba Mason portrays Bithia, Pharaoh's Wife, who is Moses' Egyptian Mother. I have seen her on Broadway as `Lucy' in ""Jekyll & Hyde: the Musical"" opposite either Sebastian Bach or David Hasselhoff as both `Jekyll' AND `Hyde'.Nita Whitaker portrays Zipporah, who becomes Moses' wife. She was in the movie ""The Bodyguard"" starring Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner as the `Oscar Singer.'Ipale' portrays Seti, Ramses' father, has been in ""Xanadu"" with Olivia Newton-John as `the Photographer,' along with both ""The Mummy"" movies as, fittingly enough, Pharaoh Seti I.For what it is worth, upon my initial viewing of this, earlier this week I thought that the melodies were nice, but something that I could almost hear at churches that use songs of the CCM {Contemporary Christian Music } genre throughout their services. Surprisingly, I have woken up with Moses' and Ramses first big song, ""When We Rule the World"" running through my head, along with some other songs from the DVD. These songs have substance to them, and I WANT IT ON CD!!!",5,Fascinating Show!,1249171200,"08 2, 2009",2009,8221,"['Ten', 'Commandments', 'Musical', 'starring', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Moses', 'features',

1017647,A1EVXRDQDDS0EU,B000HXDWIM,"Hannah Somers ""Hannah Somers""","[4, 7]","Adam sings the best song, ""Is Anybody Listening?"" Even the New York times, reviewing the Los Angeles production in 2004, pointed him out as the best singer in the show and didn't even mention anyone else but Val Kilmer.  (I checked it out online.)  Adam has a few solo lines in other songs, but ""Is Anybody Listening?"" is all his. Adam is fun to watch (duh!) and appears throughout.  The other singers are generally very good (some better than others). Val Kilmer doesn't actually sing much; his default mode is that song-speech that Rex Harrison popularized in ""My Fair Lady."" Kilmer is best (singing and acting) in the scene with his brother the pharaoh, asking him to let his people go.  That song/scene starts off strong and he sounds pretty good.  Overall, Kilmer isn't bad, but on film you can plainly see that he is too old and too out of shape to play this part. The insurmountable problem with this show is that, with two or three exceptions, most of the music is not very good.  Then too, the author of the book doesn't know how to tell a story, doesn't have any sense of drama, draws out a good story and makes it a bit boring, and doesn't understand that theatrical economy requires that one does not start with Moses' birth.  The show wants to be like Jesus Christ Superstar, but did JC Superstar start with the Jesus' birth and grind slowly forward? No.  It began shortly before Jesus' death. JC Superstar also put the story on a human scale and the Ten Commandments doesn't do that.  It sometimes seems like it was written by a 10 year old (Moses and the Pharaoh reconcile at the end! Everybody's together! Everybody's happy!).  Other than Adam, there are some nice moments: The Pharaoh's wife (Nefertiti!) has some very nice moments, particularly after her son dies in the last plague, and Moses' adoptive mother and wife are also good.  But towards the end, it starts to seem a little silly, because the music and the book are just not written well.  But, hey, the DVD's only $6.99.  Well worth it for Adam. I bought it and am happy I did.  On the DVD are are extras: Behind the Scenes (Adam speaks!) and a lengthy Picture Gallery (slide show, really), which begins accompanied to the complete track of ""Is Anyone Listening"" and, when that's over, with snippets of other songs for the rest of the slide show.  Even in 2006, the producers knew who was the best singer in the show.",5,Five stars for Adam!

1017650,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000HXDWIM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Yes, as improbable as it sounds, ""The Ten Commandments"" was made into a musical spectacle. And yes, as unlikely as it may seem, Val Kilmer was cast as Moses. If nothing else, this show had a certain curiosity factor going for it. With a huge budget and great expectations, this production opened at the Kodak Theater in Hollywood. It also received scathing reviews there. It also struggled to find an audience there. And it also closed there without heading to New York as planned.As someone who has taken in a lot of Los Angeles theater, I had planned to attend ""The Ten Commandments"" just because it sounded so odd. But when it was lambasted by the press, I decided it wasn't worth the cost. I was, therefore, delighted to see a filmed version was being offered on DVD. For one-tenth the cost of a ticket, I could own the show for posterity.In the pantheon of musical theater, ""The Ten Commandments"" isn't particularly good or particularly significant. But I must admit, there are some genuinely nice performances and a loopy sense of fun. Perhaps this story should have been powerful or moving, but I found it a cheesy delight. Some of the choreography is a hoot.  I particularly enjoyed the opening number with soldiers ripping babies from their mothers to drown them in the river. OK, maybe not everyone would find this amusing but, trust me, you just have to see it. There are bizarre special effects aplenty, jarring and comical when they should be deepening the drama. And who knew the Burning Bush had such a lovely voice?On the good side, there are some great singers in this production. Kevin Earley is terrific as Ramses.  He has a powerhouse voice and a great sense of drama. I was wishing he was in every scene. Earley is somewhat of a local celebrity, I have seen him in five shows and he never fails to deliver. What about Kilmer, though? Obviously, they wanted a ""name"" for its marquee value. Let's be succinct and just say that he is woefully miscast and doesn't possess a strong enough singing ability or stage presence to command the action. But every other performer sounds great.  It is the songs that let them down, most are generic ballads that you won't remember long.""The Ten Commandments"" might really have irritated me as a theater show, and I'd have given it a lower rating. But as an inexpensive DVD, I do recommend anyone who is interested to check it out. It doesn't serve as a serious exploration of the topic, but it works as a bit of a lark. I had a great deal of fun and a lot of laughs (probably not what the show intended) but I did appreciate a talented cast giving it their all. Worth it for Earley alone, he's a great talent in a sinking show. KGHarris, 11/06.",3,Holy Moses!

1017652,AY01SMUH5SX8A,B000HXDWIM,"Steven Valenti ""svclue""","[20, 28]","THIS is on DVD?  I knew there was a ""Ten Commandments"" musical starring Val Kilmer that opened and closed quickly in L.A., with less than enthusiastic reviews.  There was no cast recording.  I figured it would vanish into obscurity.  I was pretty surprised, then, to see the production available for viewing on DVD.  I wonder whether it was Val Kilmer's presence that made it so, or the world's predilection for Bible stories (the DVD contains subtitles in English, Spanish, French, German, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese!  That must be a record.).  In any case, I'm all for preserving theater on DVD, so I'm glad this exists.  I wish more shows made it to DVD. Is it a great musical? No.  But it still has its merits.The main problem?  The storytelling.  Just not effective enough.  The show relies too heavily on assuming the audience's knowledge of the story of Moses, with characters given little dramatic motivation (In many cases, we don't even catch their names).  It helps to be familiar with the Old Testament-- or at least the animated movie ""The Prince of Egypt,"" which seems to be an inspiration for this retelling.  Even with some attempt to create tension between Moses and his brother Ramases, there is just not enough drama.  In a way, the show seems to be missing a plot, feeling too often like a series of connected checkpoints.  Moses sailing down the river into royalty. Check.  Moses finding out his true identity. Check.  Moses banished to the desert. Check.  Burning Bush. Check.  Parting of the Red Sea. Check.  Strangely, some of the moments you think would create the most drama are all but glossed over--  the various plagues unleashed when Moses' demands are not met by the Pharoah, for instance, pass by with little fanfare.  Even Moses' obtaining of the famous tablets (The Ten Commandments of the title, of course) is paid little attention and is undermined by the show's worst song-- some quasi-bluesy thing.  I also didn't care for the choice of having a little kid sing out the Commandments near the end with almost unbearable precociousness. Ugh.All that said, the cast is really quite excellent.  The show is virtually sung through, with little dialogue, and the performers assembled here are all first-rate singers (even Kilmer is good, even if his range is considerably less than his co-stars).  They're so good, in fact, that you wish they were in a better-conceived musical.  The show is written in a pop-opera style, and if the score suffers from a certain ""sameness"" over the course of its two hours, the music by Patrick Leonard is mainly enjoyable-- and very well performed.  Even when the score falters, the cast is able to pick up the slack and make even the lesser songs soar impressively.  In fact, they even compensate to a large degree for the storytelling problems.  They work hard, and mostly succeed, to prevent what could have been total disaster in the hands of weaker performers.  The sets, costumes, and orchestrations also make the production look and sound attractive.  So whatever the critical reception, the show has enough good to recommend seeing-- at least in the form of this affordable and well directed DVD presentation.",3,Val Kilmer is... MOSES.  On DVD?
