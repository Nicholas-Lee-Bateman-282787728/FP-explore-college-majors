This DVD offers two great interval circuit style workouts that are cued well with a 15 minute toning chapter at the end. The 2nd interval routine is very high impact - and yes, this IS good for you. Why you would recommend boring Ellen Barrett, cheesy Kathy Smith or irritating Denise Austin over this workout, I don't know. This is by far more challenging and better produced. I usually do Kelly Coffey, Amy Bento, Cathe ,etc., but have started to really like Michelle Dozois, even though she is not leading these two routines. However, she does in The Transforming Workout which is recommendable as well.

There is some great variety here, and the moves are surprisingly intense if you really put your all into them.  I was surprised to see that many reviewers felt as though the moves were too fast or confusing to follow.. for an upper-intermediate, advanced exerciser (which the video is classified as this) who is familiar with basic moves, this is not the case.  Sure I stumbled a bit the first 1-2 times through.. but who doesn't when working out to a new video?  The key is to stick with it, because it will become routine just as any other workout vid.  I have been working out at home for several years, and I have seen some very noticeable changes in my legs and glutes because of these Shape routines.

1021007,A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0,B000IJ7A2O,"Deb Nam-Krane ""dnkboston""","[22, 23]","These are two fun and challenging cardio sculpt workouts.  The first alternates weights and cardio movements in a circuit to keep aerobic intensity.  Although you can change the intensity based on your weight choices, the overall effect is to keep your heart at a steady, but elevated, rate.  The second workout alternates between steady state cardio, cardio interval blasts and fast-paced sculpting.  You could probably do the first workout every day if you went light with the weights, but you wouldn't want to do the interval workout as often.The pace of both workouts is such that you could probably go to tens or even twelves for some of the sculpting in the first workout, but I wouldn't go heavier than eights for the second.  I think it's funny that so many people have remarked that the workouts aren't challenging enough because the intensity is so easy to change with weights.  I also feel like I get a lot done in a really short period of time because of the emphasis on functional movements, particularly the plank variations and one-legged squats and lunges.The three add-on ""parts"" segments are also really effective because of the functional movements.  The abs section, very reminiscent of Pilates, is my favorite.As for the instructors, these are pros from many other DVDs.  Dozois and York are very professional, but Wheeler I am actually in awe of.  She has been affiliated with the Method, Reebok, Denise Austin and now Shape.  She is very knowledgable, and that comes through.  However, all of them make me cringe through their scripted comments- ""This will get you that bikini bottom in no time!""- but not enough to reduce my rating.  And finally, I've got to say, if these instructors have flabby thighs (?!?), I'm not sure who has thin ones.Recommended for high-beginners through high-intermediates.",5,It's what you put into it,1183161600,"06 30, 2007",2007,1824,"['are', 'two', 'fun', 'challenging', 'cardio', 'sculpt', 'workouts', 'first', 'weights', 'cardio', 'movements', 'circuit', 'keep', 'aerobic', 'intensity', 'can', 'change', 'intensity', 'based', 'weight', 'choices', 'overall', 'effect', 'keep', 'heart', 'steady', 'elevated', 'rate', 'second', 'workout', 'alternates', 'steady', 'state', 'cardio', 'cardio', 'interval', 'blasts', 'fast-paced', 'sculpting', 'could', 'probably', 'do', 'first', 'workout', 'day', 'went', 'light', 'weights', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'interval', 'workout', 'often.The', 'pace', 'workouts', 'such', 'could', 'probably', 'go', 'tens', 'even', 'twelves', 'sculpting', 'first', 'workout', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'heavier', 'eights', 'second', 'think', 'funny', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'remarked', 'workouts', 'are', ""n't"", 'challenging', 'enough', 'intensity', 'so', 'easy', 'change', 'weights', 'also', 'feel', 'get', 'lot', 'done', 'really', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'emphasis', 'functional', 'movements', 'particularly', 'plank', 'variations', 'one-legged', 'squats', 'lunges.The', 'three', 'add-on', 'parts', 'segments', 'are', 'also', 'really', 'effective', 'functional', 'movements', 'abs', 'section', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Pilates', 'favorite.As', 'instructors', 'are', 'pros', 'many', 'other', 'DVDs', 'Dozois', 'York', 'are', 'very', 'professional', 'Wheeler', 'am', 'actually', 'awe', 'been', 'affiliated', 'Method', 'Reebok', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'now', 'Shape', 'very', 'knowledgable', 'through', 'However', 'make', 'cringe', 'scripted', 'comments-', 'will', 'get', 'bottom', 'time', 'not', 'enough', 'reduce', 'rating', 'finally', ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'instructors', 'have', 'flabby', 'thighs', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'thin', 'ones.Recommended', 'high-beginners', 'high-intermediates']",Shape: Bikini Body Camp Redefining Workout

This DVD and the other DVD in this set- the ""Bikini Body Transforming Workout""- are an amazing workout set!  I have never done a better workout series, on a DVD or in the gym.  They are tough!  But great!  Between the two DVDs, there are 5 30-minute workouts.  They are all great cardio, and all work your lower and middle body very well.  Some focus more on total body toning too.  They also include power moves and balance. I find the workouts fun and am never bored.  There are 5 workouts, so I never do the same workout twice in one week.  Within a few weeks, I've seen changes in my body, mostly in my butt and abs.  I also feel much healthier and more energetic. I've felt much better all around since doing these workouts, and therefore genuinely, actually look forward to doing them.  The instructors are great and never get annoying!This ""Redefining"" DVD has 3 5-minute ""mini-workouts"" for the lower body, abs, and upper body that you can add on as well.  I don't do the lower body 5-minute workout because the main workouts kill my lower body as it is.  I add on a 5-minute workout from Shape's ""Shape.. Your Abs"" DVD because I find them better than the 5-minute one on the ""Redefining"" DVD.  But I do add the 5-min upper body workout to the days when I do the workouts focused on strength.Overall I'd highly recommend these videos.  You get cardio, strength, endurance, power, balance, and energy in 30-minutes.  They are highly efficient, well designed workouts that are very fun to do and make me feel great!",5,Wow!

Workout 1 is intermediate and offers a wider variety of moves with less squats. Workout 2 is more intense.

There is absolutely no danciness to this workout--just athletic moves--and no kickboxing. The reps are not a lot with the strength parts so I would recommend for someone advanced to up the suggested 3-5 lbs to more like 8-12 which is what I used.
