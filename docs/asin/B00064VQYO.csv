860744,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B00064VQYO,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[0, 0]","This is a very good, soulful, ""blues-oriented"", guitar and band concert that was filmed June 17, 2003 on the ""Austin City Limits"" television show. The music is great, smooth, relaxing and very enjoyable to watch and hear. Susan Tedeschi and her band perform at their best.The line-up consists of: Susan Tedeschi on lead guitar and lead vocals,(Susan is an excellent ""blues"" vocalist); Jason Crosby on keyboards, violin and vocals, William Green on B3 Hammond organ and vocals (His playing style is very unique, he moves with the music.),Ron Perry on bass and vocals, and Jeff Sipe on drums and vocals.The concert consists of 15 songs. Some highlights include: ""You can make it if you try"" (A Sly Stone song); ""The Feeling Music Brings"" (written by her and her husband Derek Trucks along with Kofi Burbridge);""Love's in Need of Love Today"" (A Stevie Wonder song); ""Don't Think Twice,it's all Right""(a Bob Dylan song); ""Voodoo Woman"" (a Koko Taylor song); ""In the Garden"" (written by Susan along with Tommy Shannon of Double-Trouble); ""I Fell in Love""(written by Susan and Tom Hambridge); and it ends with an excellent performance of an excellent song ""Angel from Montgomery"" (Written by John Prine).This is a very good concert consisting of very good music that is performed very well. It's a very enjoyable concert dvd to watch and enjoy, and I recommend it.",4,"Susan Tedeschi "" Live from Austin, Texas""",1222387200,"09 26, 2008",2008,1358,"['very', 'good', 'soulful', 'blues-oriented', 'guitar', 'band', 'concert', 'was', 'filmed', 'June', '17', '2003', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'television', 'show', 'music', 'great', 'smooth', 'relaxing', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'hear', 'Susan', 'Tedeschi', 'band', 'perform', 'best.The', 'line-up', 'consists', 'Susan', 'Tedeschi', 'lead', 'guitar', 'lead', 'vocals', 'Susan', 'excellent', 'blues', 'vocalist', 'Jason', 'Crosby', 'keyboards', 'violin', 'vocals', 'William', 'Green', 'B3', 'Hammond', 'organ', 'vocals', 'playing', 'style', 'very', 'unique', 'music', 'Ron', 'Perry', 'bass', 'vocals', 'Jeff', 'Sipe', 'drums', 'vocals.The', 'concert', '15', 'songs', 'highlights', 'include', 'can', 'make', 'try', 'Sly', 'Stone', 'song', 'Feeling', 'Music', 'Brings', 'written', 'husband', 'Derek', 'Trucks', 'Kofi', 'Burbridge', 'Love', 'Need', 'Love', 'Today', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'song', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Think', 'Twice', 'Right', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'song', 'Voodoo', 'Woman', 'Koko', 'Taylor', 'song', 'Garden', 'written', 'Susan', 'Tommy', 'Shannon', 'Double-Trouble', 'Fell', 'Love', 'written', 'Susan', 'Tom', 'Hambridge', 'excellent', 'performance', 'excellent', 'song', 'Angel', 'Montgomery', 'Written', 'John', 'Prine', '.This', 'very', 'good', 'concert', 'consisting', 'very', 'good', 'music', 'performed', 'very', 'well', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'concert', 'dvd', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'recommend']",N/A

She has a very nice voice and her guitar work is adequate but not inspiring.I have not seen her in anything thing else so I don't know if it's just this performance. If I was producing this (and I should warn you, I'm no producer) I would sugest that she focus on the vocals and find a better guitar player. Maybe her husband (Dereck Trucks) would be the person to be playing the guitar for her.Just my two cents...",3,Pleasant but not exciting....,1123977600,"08 14, 2005",2005,506,"['do', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'listening', 'DVD', 'however', 'more', 'easy', 'listening', 'very', 'nice', 'voice', 'guitar', 'work', 'adequate', 'not', 'inspiring.I', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'anything', 'thing', 'else', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'performance', 'was', 'producing', 'should', 'warn', ""'m"", 'producer', 'would', 'sugest', 'focus', 'vocals', 'find', 'better', 'guitar', 'player', 'Maybe', 'husband', 'Dereck', 'Trucks', 'would', 'be', 'person', 'be', 'playing', 'guitar', 'her.Just', 'two', 'cents']",N/A

860747,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B00064VQYO,Peter Baklava,"[3, 3]","I recently saw Susan Tedeschi in performance with her 2006 band, and I bought this dvd to see how her show compared with what she did in the past.Anybody with any familiarity with Tedeschi knows that her greatest asset is her voice.  She has ""pipes"" that are the equal of Joss Stone's, or Beth Hart's, or anybody else working in a blues/r&b; vein.  She can handle almost any material with ease.This set on ""Live From Austin""  shows her versatility, as she tackles funk (""You Can Make it if You Try""), folk (""Don't Think Twice""), blues, torch songs and rock and roll.  The diverse material is particularly suited for (then) band member Jason Crosby, who contributes some tasty violin to ""Don't Think Twice, It's Alright"",  and ""Angel From Montgomery"", as well as underscoring some of the funkier offerings with electric piano.""Live From Austin"" is a pleasing mix of Tedeschi's different styles.  She is a very competent guitarist, but  I share the opinion of another reviewer in that I think she could benefit from the addition of a second guitarist.  This would free her up to concentrate more on her vocals and showmanship.  On this dvd (and when I saw her this year), she relied on her flamboyant organist Wllliam Green to get the crowd going.  With players like Green in tow, Susan will always provide a good to great show.  All she needs to do is go further with what she began with at the time of this dvd's creation---  pump up the funk, maybe record with a horn section,  keep covering the great old tunes along with her originals.In summary:  this dvd portrays a solid but shy performer with great vocal chops and good instincts for well chosen tunes to cover.  It's a good dvd, but it should pale next to what she does in the future...if she makes the right choices.",4,A performer on the rise,1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,1775,"['recently', 'saw', 'Susan', 'Tedeschi', 'performance', '2006', 'band', 'bought', 'dvd', 'see', 'how', 'show', 'compared', 'what', 'did', 'past.Anybody', 'familiarity', 'Tedeschi', 'greatest', 'asset', 'voice', 'pipes', 'are', 'equal', 'Joss', 'Stone', 'Beth', 'Hart', 'anybody', 'else', 'working', 'blues/r', 'b', 'vein', 'can', 'handle', 'almost', 'material', 'ease.This', 'set', 'Live', 'From', 'Austin', 'versatility', 'funk', 'Can', 'Make', 'Try', 'folk', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Think', 'Twice', 'blues', 'torch', 'songs', 'rock', 'roll', 'diverse', 'material', 'particularly', 'suited', 'then', 'band', 'member', 'Jason', 'Crosby', 'who', 'tasty', 'violin', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Think', 'Twice', 'Alright', 'Angel', 'From', 'Montgomery', 'as', 'well', 'underscoring', 'funkier', 'offerings', 'electric', 'piano', 'Live', 'From', 'Austin', 'pleasing', 'mix', 'Tedeschi', 'different', 'styles', 'very', 'competent', 'guitarist', 'share', 'opinion', 'reviewer', 'think', 'could', 'benefit', 'addition', 'second', 'guitarist', 'would', 'free', 'up', 'concentrate', 'more', 'vocals', 'showmanship', 'dvd', 'when', 'saw', 'year', 'relied', 'flamboyant', 'organist', 'Wllliam', 'Green', 'get', 'crowd', 'going', 'players', 'Green', 'tow', 'Susan', 'will', 'always', 'provide', 'good', 'great', 'show', 'do', 'go', 'further', 'what', 'began', 'time', 'dvd', 'creation', 'pump', 'funk', 'maybe', 'record', 'horn', 'section', 'keep', 'covering', 'great', 'old', 'tunes', 'originals.In', 'summary', 'dvd', 'solid', 'shy', 'performer', 'great', 'vocal', 'chops', 'good', 'instincts', 'well', 'chosen', 'tunes', 'cover', 'good', 'dvd', 'should', 'pale', 'next', 'what', 'future', 'right', 'choices']",N/A
