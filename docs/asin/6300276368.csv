240493,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,6300276368,,"[3, 3]","The CHILD OF GLASS is one of my favorite Disney films and I can't imagine why they haven't released it on DVD.I remember watching it in parts during the weekend, way back then, on ""the Wonderful World of Disney"" and I was immediately hooked on the story. Unfortunately I never found out how it ended until many years later when I caught a rerun on the Disney channel.Anyway, the story is based on Richard Peck's bookThe Ghost Belonged to Me, which was a really good book, and is about a family that moves into an old style southern mansion. The son, Alexander Armsworth (played brilliantly by Steve Shaw) discovers a ghost in the barn. The ghost is a young girl named Inez Dumaine who needs Alexander's help to let her rest in peace.  This is where the story differs from the book: Alexander has to solve a riddle to help the ghost. He gets help from his neighbor, a girl named Blossom Culp (another great performance by Katy Kurtzman).It's a fun and scary story and one that the whole family can watch. I really wish they would hurry up and put this on DVD so that I can watch it again!",5,*WONDERFUL* Film From *Disney*,1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,1087,"['CHILD', 'OF', 'GLASS', 'one', 'favorite', 'Disney', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'released', 'DVD.I', 'remember', 'watching', 'parts', 'weekend', 'way', 'back', 'then', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'was', 'immediately', 'hooked', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'found', 'how', 'ended', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'caught', 'rerun', 'Disney', 'channel.Anyway', 'story', 'based', 'Richard', 'Peck', 'bookThe', 'Ghost', 'Belonged', 'Me', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'book', 'family', 'old', 'style', 'southern', 'mansion', 'son', 'Alexander', 'Armsworth', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Steve', 'Shaw', 'ghost', 'barn', 'ghost', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Inez', 'Dumaine', 'who', 'Alexander', 'help', 'let', 'rest', 'peace', 'where', 'story', 'differs', 'book', 'Alexander', 'solve', 'riddle', 'help', 'ghost', 'help', 'neighbor', 'girl', 'named', 'Blossom', 'Culp', 'great', 'performance', 'Katy', 'Kurtzman', '.It', 'fun', 'scary', 'story', 'one', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'hurry', 'up', 'put', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'again']",N/A
240494,A19EKAWXJ8MY0F,6300276368,A. C. Cronvich,"[11, 11]","A kind of weird coincidence about this release. I went looking to see if it was available yet and, seeing that it wasn't, contemplated ordering one of the old VHS releases. The one I taped off of Disney Channel back around 1985 has worn thin. About a week later I went back to place an order and discovered that Child of Glass was listed for pre-order. Weird. I actually saw this in the theater. It was made for TV, If I am not mistaken, but with the high production values it is easy to see why it would get a theatrical release. Great cast. Anthony Zerbe is a surly drunken bad guy. The kids are all cute and like-able and really grow on you. Most notable is Denise Nickerson whom most kids who grew up at the time will remember from Dark Shadows, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, The Electric Company and Zero to Sixty. I'm told that this film bears only a slight resemblance to the book it is based on, but I have also heard that some think the movie is better. Nina Foch plays one of her weirdo types. Barbara Barrie is charming as the mother. Biff McGuire is a stern but caring father. Very charming is Katy Kurtzman as the nerdy bespectacled Blossom Culp who is glued to the lead character Alexander (Steve Shaw) by a crush. She's a standout. Olivia Barash, best known for Repo Man and a lot of TV roles, (You've seen her on Little House a dozen times) is ghost of murdered French girl Inez Dumaine, who cannot find her final resting place until Alexander and Blossom have unraveled a poem Inez recites. There is a bit of a love triangle here and its the sort that seems sincere and realistic. As is common with Disney productions of the era (Witch Mountain, Black Hole) the animation dep[icting Inez glowing blue manifestation is top notch. Far beyond anything the usual TV movie would strive to. The musical score is lovely and familiar to fans of 70s Disney productions. There is a certain element of The Haunted Mansion ride in this tale. No connection really, just a similar feel. Appealing all around.Though probably taken from a VHS release master or even more likely a ""videodisk"" master, the DVD quality is excellent. If you dont remember Videodisks were an early 80s format of metal LP's stored in a large flat plastic cassette. Roughly the same width as a vinyl Long Playing 33 album, and played by a stylus, the format was far superior to others of the time, such as VHS and Beta. If this was taken from a master disk of this format it is a likely explanation of the DVD's superior quality. Then again The 16mm print I saw in a theater in 1983 looked pretty damn good to. This was back when Disney meant quality instead of crap.",5,HIgh Production Value and Quality: Great,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,2653,"['kind', 'weird', 'coincidence', 'release', 'went', 'looking', 'see', 'was', 'available', 'yet', 'seeing', 'was', ""n't"", 'contemplated', 'ordering', 'one', 'old', 'VHS', 'one', 'taped', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'back', '1985', 'worn', 'thin', 'week', 'later', 'went', 'back', 'place', 'order', 'discovered', 'Child', 'Glass', 'was', 'listed', 'pre-order', 'Weird', 'actually', 'saw', 'theater', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'am', 'not', 'mistaken', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'get', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Great', 'cast', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'surly', 'drunken', 'bad', 'guy', 'kids', 'are', 'cute', 'like-able', 'really', 'grow', 'Most', 'notable', 'Denise', 'Nickerson', 'whom', 'most', 'kids', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'time', 'will', 'remember', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Electric', 'Company', 'Zero', 'Sixty', ""'m"", 'told', 'film', 'only', 'slight', 'resemblance', 'book', 'based', 'have', 'also', 'heard', 'think', 'movie', 'better', 'Nina', 'Foch', 'one', 'weirdo', 'types', 'Barbara', 'Barrie', 'charming', 'mother', 'Biff', 'McGuire', 'stern', 'caring', 'father', 'Very', 'charming', 'Katy', 'Kurtzman', 'nerdy', 'bespectacled', 'Blossom', 'Culp', 'who', 'glued', 'lead', 'character', 'Alexander', 'Steve', 'Shaw', 'crush', 'standout', 'Olivia', 'Barash', 'best', 'known', 'Repo', 'Man', 'lot', 'TV', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Little', 'House', 'dozen', 'times', 'ghost', 'murdered', 'French', 'girl', 'Inez', 'Dumaine', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'final', 'resting', 'place', 'Alexander', 'Blossom', 'have', 'unraveled', 'poem', 'Inez', 'bit', 'love', 'triangle', 'here', 'sort', 'sincere', 'realistic', 'common', 'Disney', 'productions', 'era', 'Witch', 'Mountain', 'Black', 'Hole', 'animation', 'dep', '[', 'icting', 'Inez', 'glowing', 'blue', 'manifestation', 'top', 'notch', 'Far', 'anything', 'usual', 'TV', 'movie', 'would', 'strive', 'musical', 'score', 'lovely', 'familiar', 'fans', '70s', 'Disney', 'productions', 'certain', 'element', 'Haunted', 'Mansion', 'ride', 'tale', 'connection', 'really', 'just', 'similar', 'feel', 'Appealing', 'around.Though', 'probably', 'taken', 'VHS', 'release', 'master', 'even', 'more', 'likely', 'videodisk', 'master', 'DVD', 'quality', 'excellent', 'dont', 'remember', 'Videodisks', 'were', 'early', '80s', 'format', 'metal', 'LP', 'stored', 'large', 'flat', 'plastic', 'cassette', 'Roughly', 'same', 'width', 'vinyl', 'Long', 'Playing', '33', 'album', 'played', 'stylus', 'format', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'others', 'time', 'such', 'VHS', 'Beta', 'was', 'taken', 'master', 'disk', 'format', 'likely', 'explanation', 'DVD', 'superior', 'quality', 'Then', 'again', '16mm', 'print', 'saw', 'theater', '1983', 'looked', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'was', 'back', 'when', 'Disney', 'meant', 'quality', 'instead', 'crap']",N/A

I really loved the Plantation House.I had been looking for this movie for years. I had heard that it had been released in 1986 on VHS and BETA but I couldn't find one. This year a very dear friend gave me a copy of this that he had converted to dVD. And it included a cover art that was a minature version of the origional. Even though it is a fake. I treasure this DVD. So much.This movie begins showing The Ainsworth family traveling to their new plantaion house. WHen they arive the Kids are pretty shocked at how run down the house is. Well they work on it. And you meet the Drunk Caretaker who has Murder On His Mind. One night Alexander sees a Blue Light from the hay loft of the barn. He goes out there and sees the ghost of Inez. She tells him what help she needs from him. Well Alexanders decides to help him. I don't remember the exact riddle. But it was about the 2 should touch. Well it goes on. And Alexander falls into the well. And he is found. His parents send his little friend Blossom down. And she finds the China Doll. They rescue Alexander and they go into the Cemetery into the Chapel of Inezs Family and place the doll on top of her tomb. Well the gost of Inez apperas and grabs the doll than dies and evaporates into the Tomb. THan the doll appears and falls onto the floor.

He doesn't like his normal routine disturbed. He doesn't like to be chased by Blossom-a girl who lives with her aunt played by Nina Foch. But he knows duty when it calls-and he is given the task of solving a riddle by the ghost of Inez Dummaize. He has until Midnight on Halloween to figure out the riddle so that Inez can go to her eternal rest. So Alexander & Blossom go about solving the riddle.

240517,A50W7ZVTG606,6300276368,"Naomi Tilley ""Story Buff""","[17, 17]","I saw Child of Glass when I myself was just a child, back when The Wonderful World of Disney aired on Australia's Network 7, and movies were shown in two parts, over two Saturday nights. I didn't recall many details, except that it was about the ghost of a little girl who had been murdered. For some reason, it lingered in my mind, and I never forgot it.With the advent of the Internet, I was finally able to work out which film it was, but I have had to wait until now before I was able to live the nostalgia of that film.Firstly, the film:Child of Glass is a beautiful film that is suitable for children and adults alike. Whilst I'd be mindful of a few scenes that might scare some young children, there is plenty to keep interest with all ages. The movie focuses on two young protagonists, Alexander and Blossom, and their encounter with the ghost of young Inez Dumain, who has been condemned to remain trapped on Earth in a kind of limbo by the curse of the wicked uncle who took her life. Initially skeptical, Alexander eventually accepts the responsibility of helping Inez to find her way to eternal rest, by solving the riddle:""Sleeping lies the murdered lass,Vainly cries the child of glass,When the two shall be as one,The spirit's journey will be done.""Along the way, Alexander encounters danger and excitement, and also finds real friendship where he wasn't previously looking for it, and Blossom finds that she is a valuable person in her own right.It is a truly charming film, mixing the values of friendship with a haunting supernatural tale.Secondly, the DVD itself:This is not a remastered Disney film, and therefore the quality will not be up to the standard of The Lion King. However, taking into account that this is a film from within the depths of the Disney Vault, and has simply been recorded straight onto DVD-R, the quality is more than acceptable. I found the picture to be quite clear. The sound was a little soft, and I needed to turn up the volume on the TV several notches, but it was in sync with the picture. There was no static, no break up of the picture or sound and the lack of promo material at the start was actually refreshing.It is very much a no frills product, but is well worth the purchase.",5,A Wonderful Dose of Nostalgia,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,2235,"['saw', 'Child', 'Glass', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'child', 'back', 'when', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'aired', 'Australia', 'Network', '7', 'movies', 'were', 'shown', 'two', 'parts', 'two', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'did', ""n't"", 'recall', 'many', 'details', 'was', 'ghost', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'murdered', 'reason', 'lingered', 'mind', 'never', 'forgot', 'advent', 'Internet', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'work', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'have', 'had', 'wait', 'now', 'was', 'able', 'live', 'nostalgia', 'film.Firstly', 'film', 'Child', 'Glass', 'beautiful', 'film', 'suitable', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'Whilst', ""'d"", 'be', 'mindful', 'few', 'scenes', 'might', 'scare', 'young', 'children', 'plenty', 'keep', 'interest', 'ages', 'movie', 'two', 'young', 'protagonists', 'Alexander', 'Blossom', 'encounter', 'ghost', 'young', 'Inez', 'Dumain', 'who', 'been', 'condemned', 'remain', 'trapped', 'Earth', 'kind', 'limbo', 'curse', 'wicked', 'uncle', 'who', 'took', 'life', 'Initially', 'skeptical', 'Alexander', 'eventually', 'responsibility', 'helping', 'Inez', 'find', 'way', 'eternal', 'rest', 'solving', 'riddle', 'Sleeping', 'murdered', 'lass', 'Vainly', 'child', 'glass', 'When', 'two', 'shall', 'be', 'one', 'spirit', 'journey', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'way', 'Alexander', 'danger', 'excitement', 'also', 'real', 'friendship', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'previously', 'looking', 'Blossom', 'valuable', 'person', 'own', 'right.It', 'truly', 'charming', 'film', 'mixing', 'values', 'friendship', 'haunting', 'supernatural', 'tale.Secondly', 'DVD', 'not', 'remastered', 'Disney', 'film', 'therefore', 'quality', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'up', 'standard', 'Lion', 'King', 'However', 'taking', 'account', 'film', 'depths', 'Disney', 'Vault', 'simply', 'been', 'recorded', 'straight', 'DVD-R', 'quality', 'more', 'acceptable', 'found', 'picture', 'be', 'quite', 'clear', 'sound', 'was', 'little', 'soft', 'needed', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'TV', 'several', 'notches', 'was', 'sync', 'picture', 'was', 'static', 'break', 'picture', 'sound', 'lack', 'promo', 'material', 'start', 'was', 'actually', 'refreshing.It', 'very', 'much', 'frills', 'product', 'well', 'purchase']",N/A

This film was one of those reasons why I enjoyed the series so much.Child of Glass stars a young boy named Alexander who with his family move into a new house in Kentucky. While the rest of the family focuses on remodeling the home, young Alexander is exploring something else- the ghost of a young girl.Upon further investigation, and visitations with the girl, he learns the name of the ghost, Inez. She pleads with Alexander to solve a riddle and find the ""Child of Glass"" which will bring closure to her life and will release her from being a ghost. She convinces Alexander to help her solve the riddle and he enlists his new friend Blossom to help him.The most touching point in the film, is during a dance Alexander's family holds to celebrate the newly restored home. Inez appears and tells Alexander that she can become real just for a few minutes, and asks him to dance with her. It truly shows that a friendship has begun and Alexander becomes more intent on helping his new friend move on.The end of the film finds Alexander and Blossom in a creepy cemetery where Inez's body lies. Alexander and Blossom are racing against the clock to help Inez rest in peace.I can't believe that Child of Glass has not yet appeared on dvd. It's a great film, that evidently Disney has forgotten (along with many other great ones....The Ghosts of Buxley Hall, The Mystery of Dracula's Castle, etc). Disney has created a Wonderful World of Disney line as an exclusive for Disney Movie Club members, so maybe they'll release it as a part of that collection, or better yet in a public release for ALL to enjoy.Until then, get your hands on the vhs and relive those great Disney memories.
