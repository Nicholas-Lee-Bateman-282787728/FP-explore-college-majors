375376,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6303451527,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Like all their movies, Cheech & Chong's THINGS ARE TOUGH ALL OVER (1982) suffers under the harsh light of sobriety. Their many illegal substance references simply fall flat without the proper ""atmosphere."" Also, Tommy's chewing on a horse doover that he thinks is peyote, or his sulfurous flatulence are simply in bad taste. The 'two uglies in drag' sequence isn't as funny as it seemed a quarter century ago, either.Their turn as a pair of heavily-accented Arabs, Mr. Slyman and Prince Habib remains this movie's strongest material and if we ignore present world circumstances it's good for a few chuckles. (Examples: ""hairpiece/herpes"" joke and Habib ""killing"" a rental car.) Zany Rip Taylor is another comedic highlight, but George Wallace's cameo as the ""Champ"" who's become a drunken street person is just sad.SYNOPSIS--Two Chicago car wash screw-ups are sent to Las Vegas by their Arab employers, unaware that the luxury car they're driving has five million ""dirty"" bucks stashed under a seat. Along the way, the boys barter for fuel with pieces of the car, including that seat. They drop off the disassembled vehicle in Vegas then cut out with a couple of ""French Fifis"" (played by wives Rikki and Shelby), again not knowing these are the bosses' girlfriends.When they find their cash gone, an enraged Slyman and Habib begin hunting down our heroes, who are meanwhile involved in all kinds of nutty stuff, including some ""in flagrante"" time with the Fifis as part of a clandestinely-shot skin flick, and gettng abandoned by Rip Taylor at a fancy eatery while they're crossdressed. As Tommy freaks out over his missing gonads (blame it on pantyhose), the Arabs are right behind them in the next booth!Related item:THE CORSICAN BROTHERS(1984) is a family affair featuring Cheech and Rikki Marin, plus Tommy, Shelby, Robbi and Rae Dawn Chong.",3,"Mr. Slyman: ""You can have my hairpiece!""",1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,1846,"['movies', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'THINGS', 'ARE', 'TOUGH', 'ALL', 'OVER', '1982', 'suffers', 'harsh', 'light', 'sobriety', 'many', 'illegal', 'substance', 'references', 'simply', 'fall', 'flat', 'proper', 'atmosphere', 'Also', 'Tommy', 'chewing', 'horse', 'doover', 'peyote', 'sulfurous', 'flatulence', 'are', 'simply', 'bad', 'taste', ""'two"", 'uglies', 'drag', 'sequence', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'seemed', 'quarter', 'century', 'ago', 'either.Their', 'turn', 'pair', 'heavily-accented', 'Arabs', 'Mr.', 'Slyman', 'Prince', 'Habib', 'movie', 'strongest', 'material', 'ignore', 'present', 'world', 'circumstances', 'good', 'few', 'chuckles', 'Examples', 'hairpiece/herpes', 'joke', 'Habib', 'killing', 'rental', 'car', 'Zany', 'Rip', 'Taylor', 'comedic', 'highlight', 'George', 'Wallace', 'cameo', 'Champ', 'who', 'become', 'drunken', 'street', 'person', 'just', 'sad.SYNOPSIS', 'Two', 'Chicago', 'car', 'wash', 'screw-ups', 'are', 'sent', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Arab', 'employers', 'unaware', 'luxury', 'car', ""'re"", 'driving', 'five', 'million', 'dirty', 'bucks', 'stashed', 'seat', 'way', 'boys', 'barter', 'fuel', 'pieces', 'car', 'including', 'seat', 'drop', 'off', 'disassembled', 'vehicle', 'Vegas', 'then', 'cut', 'out', 'couple', 'French', 'Fifis', 'played', 'wives', 'Rikki', 'Shelby', 'again', 'not', 'knowing', 'are', 'bosses', 'girlfriends.When', 'find', 'cash', 'gone', 'enraged', 'Slyman', 'Habib', 'begin', 'hunting', 'down', 'heroes', 'who', 'are', 'meanwhile', 'involved', 'kinds', 'nutty', 'stuff', 'including', 'flagrante', 'time', 'Fifis', 'part', 'clandestinely-shot', 'skin', 'flick', 'gettng', 'abandoned', 'Rip', 'Taylor', 'fancy', 'eatery', ""'re"", 'crossdressed', 'Tommy', 'out', 'missing', 'gonads', 'blame', 'pantyhose', 'Arabs', 'are', 'right', 'next', 'booth', 'Related', 'item', 'CORSICAN', 'BROTHERS', '1984', 'family', 'affair', 'featuring', 'Cheech', 'Rikki', 'Marin', 'Tommy', 'Shelby', 'Robbi', 'Rae', 'Dawn', 'Chong']",Things Are Tough All Over VHS

375380,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,6303451527,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[9, 9]","Cheech and Chong are back in such strong form here that it makes me wonder if I shouldn't reevaluate the previous film, Nice Dreams (1981), which seemed like a misstep to me on my last viewing.Of course, there are some major differences with Things are Tough All Over.  For Nice Dreams, Cheech and Chong took the ultimate stoner/slacker route and made a film with little plot or direction.  It seemed like they were engaging in the same behavior offscreen as on and just and playing around with loose, rough ideas.  Maybe they also wondered what the heck they had done when later watching Nice Dreams (or watching the box office returns), because for Things are Tough All Over, they took an entirely different path and crafted an intricately structured comic misadventure where they play two interweaving sets of characters--Cheech and Chong, of course, and Mr. Slyman (Cheech) and Prince Habib (Chong), Arab brothers who serve as Cheech and Chong's employers in various guises.The script for Things are Tough All Over may have been something Cheech and Chong were working on for awhile.  The basic subtext (as reflected in the title) is the recession during the Carter years in the U.S.  Slyman and Habib represent the flipside of the gas crisis (which is both metaphorically and literally in the plot at the same time in interesting and funny ways, even including flatulence jokes), and their prosperity as well as Cheech and Chong's role in the climax and denouement of the film represent the change of economic and social climate of the Reagan years.  This may be reading a bit too heavily into the film, but to some extent, these themes were definitely intentional.Not that this is a serious film.  The gags here are on par with Up in Smoke (1978).  And given the engaging misadventure/road-movie plot, the gags have a purpose that makes them that much better.  Things are Tough All Over is also unusual in that it's the first Cheech and Chong film that's not focused on drugs.  Not that I dislike drug humor (or the idea of drug use), but not _having_ to make this film about drugs opens up the door for Cheech and Chong to focus on comedy for its own sake.  They go with material because it's going to be funny, and their timing is exquisitely on--they know just how far they can milk any particular joke for maximum effect.",5,This is funny and engaging all over,1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,2331,"['Cheech', 'Chong', 'are', 'back', 'such', 'strong', 'form', 'here', 'wonder', 'should', ""n't"", 'reevaluate', 'previous', 'film', 'Nice', 'Dreams', '1981', 'seemed', 'misstep', 'last', 'viewing.Of', 'course', 'are', 'major', 'differences', 'Things', 'are', 'Tough', 'All', 'Over', 'Nice', 'Dreams', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'took', 'ultimate', 'stoner/slacker', 'route', 'made', 'film', 'little', 'plot', 'direction', 'seemed', 'were', 'engaging', 'same', 'behavior', 'offscreen', 'just', 'playing', 'loose', 'rough', 'ideas', 'Maybe', 'also', 'wondered', 'what', 'heck', 'had', 'done', 'when', 'later', 'watching', 'Nice', 'Dreams', 'watching', 'box', 'office', 'returns', 'Things', 'are', 'Tough', 'All', 'Over', 'took', 'entirely', 'different', 'path', 'crafted', 'intricately', 'structured', 'comic', 'misadventure', 'where', 'play', 'two', 'interweaving', 'sets', 'characters', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'course', 'Mr.', 'Slyman', 'Cheech', 'Prince', 'Habib', 'Chong', 'Arab', 'brothers', 'who', 'serve', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'employers', 'various', 'guises.The', 'script', 'Things', 'are', 'Tough', 'All', 'Over', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'were', 'working', 'awhile', 'basic', 'subtext', 'reflected', 'title', 'recession', 'Carter', 'years', 'U.S.', 'Slyman', 'Habib', 'represent', 'flipside', 'gas', 'crisis', 'metaphorically', 'literally', 'plot', 'same', 'time', 'interesting', 'funny', 'ways', 'even', 'including', 'flatulence', 'jokes', 'prosperity', 'as', 'well', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'role', 'climax', 'denouement', 'film', 'represent', 'change', 'economic', 'social', 'climate', 'Reagan', 'years', 'may', 'be', 'reading', 'bit', 'too', 'heavily', 'film', 'extent', 'themes', 'were', 'definitely', 'intentional.Not', 'serious', 'film', 'gags', 'here', 'are', 'par', 'Up', 'Smoke', '1978', 'given', 'engaging', 'misadventure/road-movie', 'plot', 'gags', 'have', 'purpose', 'much', 'better', 'Things', 'are', 'Tough', 'All', 'Over', 'also', 'unusual', 'first', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'film', 'not', 'focused', 'drugs', 'Not', 'dislike', 'drug', 'humor', 'idea', 'drug', 'use', 'not', '_having_', 'make', 'film', 'drugs', 'up', 'door', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'focus', 'comedy', 'own', 'sake', 'go', 'material', 'going', 'be', 'funny', 'timing', 'exquisitely', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'milk', 'particular', 'joke', 'maximum', 'effect']",Things Are Tough All Over VHS

375383,AYVFNOQHY8P3,6303451527,J. Christal,"[1, 3]","Thing's Are Tough All Over is a different approach for Cheech and Chong, and it suprisingly and finitely works to they're advantage.  In this film, there isn't as much weed as there was in past movies, but it has some drug moments in case the always tokers are interested (a very funny joke comes up in the desert dealing with paiotti by the way).But in this film, they play 2 characters a piece- Cheech as himself and Mr. Slyman and Chong as himself and Prince Habib.  Depending on how much you like the duo's characters depends on if you like the movie, but if you find them funny, as I did, then you have the key.  Especially since the unintended jokes by the two arabs are hilarious (i have hairpiece on my head/you have herpes on your head?).Anyway, the plot deals with the two guys (themselves) on a mission across America from Chicago to Las Vegas to deliver a car which gets dismantled along the way.
