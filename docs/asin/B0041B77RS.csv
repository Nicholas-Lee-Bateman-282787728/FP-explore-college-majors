Audio was clear.  Clearly an import, it also lacked English subtitles for he hearing impaired like me. At least I have a version of it.  However, when I find something better, I will get rid of it.",3,I did not like the video level,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,331,"['Lacking', 'something', '4:3', 'display', 'old', 'TV', 'viewing', 'when', 'expected', 'least', 'wide', 'screen', 'did', 'not', 'video', 'level', 'Audio', 'was', 'clear', 'Clearly', 'import', 'also', 'lacked', 'English', 'subtitles', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'least', 'have', 'version', 'However', 'when', 'find', 'something', 'better', 'will', 'get', 'rid']",N/A

The series concept was well-thought out and the sets and special effects were great.  Often, sci-fi movies/series can be cheesy with sub-standard music and dialogue, but it's easy to get caught up in and remain fascinated by this series.  What's really good is that since there so many different plots going on in the series, the intro to each episode connects what's about to be shown with what has already transpired in that plot line.  Each season continues the same high quality.",5,Believeable series,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,551,"['none', 'actors', 'were', 'familiar', 'were', 'superb', 'series', 'concept', 'was', 'well-thought', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'Often', 'sci-fi', 'movies/series', 'can', 'be', 'cheesy', 'sub-standard', 'music', 'dialogue', 'easy', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'remain', 'fascinated', 'series', 'What', 'really', 'good', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'plots', 'going', 'series', 'intro', 'episode', 'what', 'be', 'shown', 'what', 'already', 'transpired', 'plot', 'line', 'season', 'same', 'high', 'quality']",N/A
