Agnes arrives with news. David works at his writing and finishes a book; it is successful. David meets Agnes again. Will there be a happy ending? Yes.Charles Dickens was famous for his characters. There are some lessons in this story. I never read the book, others can comment on this movie version. Books are adapted to movies, there is simplification and condensation. Was this story based on Dicken's own personal experiences? This story shows human life and the lessons or warnings from their activities. This movie generally shows David hatless, a strange habit in those times.",4,A Story of Society,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,3987,"['David', 'Copperfield', '1999', 'filmThe', 'story', 'English', 'village', 'where', 'coffin', 'carried', 'country', 'lane', 'Miss', 'Betsy', 'Trotwood', 'visits', 'Widow', 'Copperfield', 'who', 'soon', 'birth', 'son', 'Young', 'David', 'had', 'happy', 'childhood', 'mother', 'found', 'second', 'husband', 'David', 'Pegotty', 'go', 'vacation', 'Yarmouth', 'sea', 'meet', 'family', 'live', 'ship', 'land', 'When', 'new', 'father', 'new', 'housekeeper', 'now', 'Edward', 'sister', 'Jane', 'Murdstone', 'Clara', 'surprised', 'David', 'sent', 'bed', 'Edward', 'David', 'behavior', 'firm', 'harsh', 'manner', 'caning', 'kept', 'locked', 'room', 'seven', 'day', '[', 'Did', 'David', 'have', 'own', 'age', ']', 'Miss', 'Pegotty', 'David', 'sent', 'away', 'hard', 'treatment', '[', 'Do', 'children', 'pack', 'up', 'pick', 'new', 'boy', ']', 'hands', 'are', 'whipped', 'Steerforth', 'School', 'discipline', 'harsh.When', 'David', 'home', 'younger', 'brother', 'learned', 'manners', 'Then', 'school', 'mother', 'died', 'Pegotty', 'fired', 'job', 'marries', 'Mrs.', 'Barkus', 'Mr.', 'Murdstone', 'David', 'London', 'earn', 'living', 'factory', 'taken', 'new', 'home', 'Micawber', 'family', 'David', 'bargain', 'Micawber', 'sent', 'Debtor', 'Prison', 'Misery', 'being', 'debt', 'David', 'clothes', 'money', 'travel', 'Dover', 'mistake', 'trusting', 'stranger', 'who', 'robs', 'David', 'must', 'walk', 'way', 'Dover', 'meet', 'aunt', 'Betsy', 'Mr.', 'Dick', 'odd', 'character', 'wh', 'Betsy', 'Betsy', 'Murdstone', 'sister', 'Jane', 'David', 'will', 'go', 'new', 'school', 'board', 'Mr.', 'Whitfield', 'aunt', 'Betsy', 'lawyer', 'Betsy', 'advice', 'David', 'who', 'Agnes', 'Uriah', 'Heep', 'years', 'pass', 'David', 'Agnes', 'are', 'grown', 'up', 'David', 'will', 'enter', 'business', 'clerk', 'price', '1,000', 'lodgings', 'Months', 'later', 'Dora', 'owner', 'daughter.David', 'invited', 'Dora', 'picnic', 'fell', 'love', 'Agnes', 'again', 'Steerforth', 'Uriah', 'Heep', 'David', 'Whitfield', 'business', 'David', 'Micawber', 'again', 'visit', 'Steerforth', 'travel', 'Yarmouth', 'Steerforth', 'down', 'inferiors', 'David', 'Pegotty', 'Barkus', 'again', 'Emily', 'marry', 'Ham', 'Steerforth', 'boat', 'Micawber', 'new', 'job', 'Uriah', 'Heep', 'Betsy', 'Trotwood', 'lost', 'fortune', 'bad', 'investments', 'David', 'Dora', '[', 'practical', ']', 'David', 'talks', 'Agnes', 'plans', 'Whitfield', 'Heep', 'actions', 'Agnes', 'goodbye', 'Spendlow', 'David', 'forget', 'Dora', 'sudden', 'death', 'problem', 'David', 'Emily', 'left', 'Ham', 'go', 'away', 'Steerforth', 'Steerforth', 'mother', 'also', 'distressed', 'David', 'Spendlow', 'company', 'went', 'bankrupt', 'Dora', 'destitute.David', 'wrote', 'articles', 'were', 'bought', 'published', 'new', 'career', 'married', 'Dora', 'cook', 'lacking', 'skills', '[', 'Should', 'man', 'chose', 'wife', 'just', 'looks', ']', 'search', 'Emily', '[', 'see', 'how', 'upper', 'class', 'treats', 'common', 'people', ']', 'Back', 'Yarmouth', 'ship', 'aground', 'sink', 'Can', 'man', 'be', 'saved', 'bodies', 'lie', 'sands', 'David', 'news', 'Mrs.', 'Steerforth', 'meeting', 'Whitfield', 'home', 'where', 'Micawber', 'Heep', 'embezzling', 'Betsy', 'Trotwood', 'Heep', 'actions', 'Will', 'Micawber', 'consider', 'immigration', 'Australia', 'Something', 'will', 'turn', 'up', 'ship', 'also', 'prisoners', 'exiled', 'Australia', 'home', 'Dora', 'failing', 'health', 'Agnes', 'news', 'David', 'writing', 'book', 'successful', 'David', 'Agnes', 'again', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'Yes.Charles', 'Dickens', 'was', 'famous', 'characters', 'are', 'lessons', 'story', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'others', 'can', 'comment', 'movie', 'version', 'Books', 'are', 'adapted', 'movies', 'simplification', 'condensation', 'Was', 'story', 'based', 'Dicken', 'own', 'personal', 'experiences', 'story', 'human', 'life', 'lessons', 'warnings', 'activities', 'movie', 'generally', 'David', 'hatless', 'strange', 'habit', 'times']",N/A
583974,A15E01890A5IX5,B00005JHCP,Alison Leigh,"[5, 6]","David Copperfield is a wonderful BBC miniseries which boasts an all-star cast--Maggie Smith, Bob Hoskins, Daniel Radcliffe (a young Harry Potter!), and Emilia Fox, just to name a few. It is a first-rate production and should appeal to a wide audience (very family friendly).In David Copperfield viewers see young David grow from a helpless child abused by his stepfather to a self assured young man. Along the way there are storylines filled with some of the most vivid and interesting supporting characters in literature:  David's eccentric Aunt Betsey Trotwood, the eternal debtor Macawber, and the Copperfield's ever faithful and loving servant Pegaty are only a sample of the wonderful characters and roles. Joanna Page also does a wonderful job as Dora Spindlow, playing her with a sweet naiivity.My only complaint is that I just didn't want young David played by Daniel Radcliffe to grow up! Radcliffe was perfect in his role, and while the adult David wasn't a bad actor, I felt that they could have cast someone a little more appropriate for the role. However, this complaint is only minor and there are more than enough good things about the miniseries to make up for it.I strongly urge all movie lovers to watch David Copperfield.

It needs at least 6, and 9 would be even better. It really couldn't have been any better of a production in any way except the length. The costumes, sets, acting are all wonderful. But the limited time of 3 hours just doesn't allow for the thorough portrayal that this book deserves. Since many of the 'key' events in the novel that can't be left out are somewhat depressing, the overall impression from watching this show is that the book must be very depressing. But that's only because all the 'in between' uplifting and enjoyable occurences had to be chopped out to fit in the 3-hour time frame. The book presents a much more balanced life (i.e. not sad all the time) and is much more fulfilling.

583984,A358XP3X4U0X45,B00005JHCP,bookloversfriend,"[7, 11]","If the BBC can devote 26 episodes to the Forsyte Saga (an excellent movie), surely they can devote 12 episodes to the greatest novel in the English language.  Or to put it another way, if the BBC can devote five hours to an inferior novel like ""The Buccaneers"", surely they can devote twice that number to David Copperfield.The 1974 version of the book is 5 hours long, the longest version so far.  It includes all the important events of the novel, but only touches on these events and the many characters and does not have time to make the events as effective as they could be.  The script is creditable except a few times where they ducked a dramatic scene, breaking before and coming in afterward, including the scene which Tolstoy called the greatest in all of world literature--the storm at sea.  It is also a low budget film.The casting is inferior with weak performances of almost all the actors (the exceptions being Anthony Andrews as Steerforth, the actress who played Aunt Betsy and the actor who played Heap, who gave us the best Uriah of any of the movie versions).  Outstanding examples of bad casting were (1) David's mother, who should have been young and dainty instead of 40 and rugged, and (2) Dora, who should have been 16 and petite instead of late 30s and tall and sturdy.  Also, the actor played Macawber too seriously without the touch of comic absurdity which the book has and which the part required.  The actor who played the grown-up David did not look half so bad as the picture on the cover and played his part adequately.The 1935 version with its stark black and white resembles the Cruikshank drawings in the book, and many of the performances are definitive: Freddy Bartholomew as young David, Edna Mae Oliver as Aunt Betsy, Basil Rathbone as Murdstone, Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Peggoty, as well as the people who played David's mother, little Emily, and most of the minor characters.  It is an effective and indelible movie, marred only by having to leave so much out (2 hours 10 minutes) and by the horrendously inappropriate casting of W.C. Fields as Macawber (the most laconic actor in the movies to play the most loquacious character in all literature?!)  His laboring to get the words out is painful to watch.  The director, George Cukor, wanted Charles Laughton.  Louis B. Mayer overruled him.  But the filmmaker knew how to make movies, and the screenwriter knew how to write screenplays.  The same cannot be said for the other film versions.The 1970 version is a joke.  Some smart-aleck screenwriter thought it would be clever to chop the story up into bits, toss them in the air, pick them up randomly and show them to the audience.  All the moving events are thus rendered totally ineffective.  This version is useful only as a lesson in how to ruin a great story.The 1999 version is only three hours long and has more elaborate sets, some location shooting, and background music, but suffers from poor or inappropriate casting.  Maggie Smith chose to play Aunt Betsy as a straight serious role, depriving the character of the comic touches which make Aunt Betsy such a cherished character.  Bob Hoskins' performance bears no relation to Macawber, thus depriving us of one of the most colorful characters in all literature.  Incredibly, the actor chosen to play Murdstone looks almost identical to Hoskins!  Imelda Staunton portrays Mrs. Macawber very well, and the boy does well enough as young David, but the rest of the cast is lamentable.  And the omission of Traddles is a loss.  The script is hit and miss.  But the most serious problems are the introduction of a narrator who is constantly narrating and keeping the audience at one remove from the events, and the actor who played the grown-up David.

583989,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00005JHCP,Byron Kolln,"[4, 4]","Time and again, Charles Dickens was asked to write an autobiography, but the fear of revisiting painful childhood memories prevented him from doing so.  The closest he ever got to writing about his youth was in ""David Copperfield"", in which he recounts the life of a young man (closely modelled on himself), who is thwarted by cruel circumstance but ultimately transformed by love and fortune.The idyllic childhood of young David Copperfield (played as a child by Daniel Radcliffe and for the remainder of the miniseries by Ciaran McMenamin) comes to a crashing end, when his beautiful, widowed mother Clara (Emilia Fox) decides to marry Mr Murdstone (Trevor Eve).  Hovering like a pair of destructive vultures, Murdstone and his sister (Zoe Wanamaker) pack David off to a macabre boarding school and subsequently drive heartbroken Clara into an early grave.Now orphaned, David goes to work at Murdstone's blacking factory in London, where he is taken under-wing by Mr Micawber (Bob Hoskins), a charming rogue who is constantly in demand with the debt-collectors.  Realising David's precarious place as a lone child in London, Micawber urges him to seek out his only living relative - Aunt Betsey Trotwood (Dame Maggie Smith), who lives with her eccentric companion Mr Dick (Ian McNeice) in Dover.  Horrified Betsey assumes legal guardianship of David once she learns of the Murdstones' abuse, and determines to raise him as a young gentleman of great prospects.  Back in London, he trains as a clerk, but is sidetracked by his infatuation for the lovely Dora Spenlow (Joanna Page).As the threads and figures of David's childhood begin to mingle and merge in his current life (often with heartbreaking and disastrous results), David must find a way to reconcile the events of the past in order to find happiness in the future.This most delightful, soul-stirring and often intensely moving of Dickens' works is given a solid screen treatment in the BBC's masterful 1999 2-part miniseries.  I cannot find a single fault, except perhaps that I wished it was longer!  The BBC's literary and costume dramas are often amongst the best of the best, and here, their casting department has gone into overdrive, furnishing the production with an extensive gallery of talents from stage and screen to portray the roster of Dickens creations - Pauline Quirke as Peggotty, Imelda Staunton as Mrs Micawber, Dawn French as Mrs Crupp, Nicholas Lyndhurst as Uriah Heep, Alun Armstrong as Dan Peggotty and Sir Ian McKellan as Creakle, to name just a few.Just a year away from his ""Harry Potter"" superstardom, Daniel Radcliffe gives a lovely performance as young David with a deep feeling for the part (the keyhole scene with Peggotty is heartbreaking).  Ciaran McMenamin's bookending older David is just as delightful.  Dame Maggie Smith was born to play Aunt Betsey and you'll want to stand up and cheer when she cuts the Murdstones' down to size!A master-class in how to adapt a classic novel and make it fresh again for the small screen, this DAVID COPPERFIELD is one to treasure.

583993,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B00005JHCP,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[4, 4]","By enlarge, a refreshing aspect of this film is the quality of acting and the casting for the parts of Dickens characters. Daniel Radcliffe (of Harry Potter fame) does a good job of young David Copperfield, seeming to bring the innocence and mistrust to the boy who hopes for a better future. Maggie Smith does a superb job of playing David's aunt, Betsey Trotwood, capturing the dimensionality expected of a character who first rejects, then accepts David into her life.The film exemplifies the mood of Dickens' work. David endures quite a troublesome and painful existence as a child, either being neglected or treated maliciously by his cold, callus stepfather, Mr. Murdstone. After David also has difficulties in school, and then is robbed and left penniless, he takes a chance on his aunt for help. There is a wonderful scene where Betsey has a confrontation with Murdstone, who is trying to gain custody of David, and ends up telling him to leave.There are other characters who represent bright spots in David's life, such as Clara Peggotty (David's nanny), Mr. Peggotty, Mr. Micawber, and David's true love, Agnes Wickfield. Agnes represents a true soul for David's troubled life, as she listens to David's concerns and is always there for him in his times of desperation, even while he is married to the child-like Dora.A prevalent aspect of Dickens-based works is the idea that those who have difficult stations in life can rise up to bigger and better things if they struggle along and find their way. We see this subject captured in David Copperfield, and the bitter aspects of his life are all a part of the journey to overcoming, and having hope for the future.If there is one beef with this film, it is the pacing. As one reviewer mentioned, the second part of the film tends to wane a little, and doesn't quite have the same impact as the first half. Still, this doesn't take away from the over all impact of the film.Dickens once said that, of all novels, David Copperfield was his ""child,"" because it was close to home, and nearest to his life.

L'hoir,"[2, 2]","There are many reasons to watch this excellent film: it contains mystery, melodrama, romance, scrumptious costumes, and a splendid cast of the finest actors, including Bob Hoskins, as the debt-ridden Mr. Macawber--always waiting optimistically for something to ""turn up""; and his wife, ""faithful to the end,"" played with to the hilt by Imelda Staunton; and, of course, the young Daniel Radcliffe in his pre-Harry Potter days, who portrays the title role with the ease of a natural actor; he is totally believable.Of the many reasons to purchase this excellent DVD, however, the most compelling is the privilege of watching Dame Maggie Smith reveling in the role of Aunt Betsy. Whether she is banishing donkeys from her green sward or falling backwards into her herbaceous border upon being accosted by her unknown ragamuffin nephew, Dame Maggie is magnificent to behold. The highlight for me was her sending the ghastly Murdstones packing with a flea in their ears; a feat she reprises after the unmasking of the opprobrious Uriah Heap. Smith is so perfect one would think that Dickens had created the role especially for her.My only criticism concerns the dashing Steerforth, whose character, undoubtedly because of considerations of length, was given short shrift. The film did not develop the friendship that grows between David and Steerforth in school, which explains the utter trust in which David holds his friend when they grow up, and also exposes the utter betrayal of that friendship.With its theme of embezzlement, the film proves to be especially timely in respect to today's money catastrophe; one wishes that its solution to the crisis--transportation for life--was still available for the financial miscreants; but then I suppose that Australia would refuse to take them!""David Copperfield"" is riveting from beginning to end; and the end is guaranteed to engender mixed feelings--happiness that it ends on such an upbeat, and sorrow that it has to end at all. One almost longs for a spinoff sequel that follows the fate of the Macawbers in Australia.At any rate, purchase ""David Copperfield""; it's a keeper.

Perkins ""wide reader""","[0, 0]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThis Masterpiece Theater treatment of Dickens' classic and most personal book ""David Copperfield"" boasts a cast which is nearly uniformly excellent. Bob Hoskins, Imelda Staunton, Maggie Smith, Ian McKellan, and a very young Daniel Radcliffe are only some of the gifted actors plying their trade to bring the classic story to life.While casting is strong, the quality of the written adaptation suffers as it pares down Dickens' tome in all of the wrong places.  This is undoubtedly due to the production being a miniseries rather than a full-blown film.  Still, the demands of brevity which a miniseries imposes were met much more successfully in a 2005 rendering of ""Bleak House,"" another adaptation of a famously lengthy Dickens saga.  To give examples of storytelling shortcomings in this production, Uriah Heep is shorn of most of his storyline, though the magnetic oiliness of the character still comes through in a remarkable performance by Nicholas Lyndhurst.  Additionally, the Murdstones, who form a brilliant Alpha and Omega thematic line for David in the book are completely forgotten in the second half of this miniseries.Also featuring a charming Ian MacNiece as the simpleminded and wise Mr. Dick, this production of ""David Copperfield"" retains a hearty intelligence which mostly overcomes a poorly adapted screenplay.",4,"On balance, one of the finest film versions of ""David Copperfield"" I've seen",1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,1346,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWThis', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'treatment', 'Dickens', 'classic', 'most', 'personal', 'book', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'cast', 'nearly', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'very', 'young', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'are', 'only', 'gifted', 'actors', 'plying', 'trade', 'bring', 'classic', 'story', 'life.While', 'casting', 'strong', 'quality', 'written', 'adaptation', 'suffers', 'down', 'Dickens', 'tome', 'wrong', 'places', 'undoubtedly', 'due', 'production', 'being', 'miniseries', 'rather', 'full-blown', 'film', 'Still', 'demands', 'brevity', 'miniseries', 'imposes', 'were', 'met', 'much', 'more', 'successfully', '2005', 'rendering', 'Bleak', 'House', 'adaptation', 'famously', 'lengthy', 'Dickens', 'saga', 'give', 'examples', 'storytelling', 'shortcomings', 'production', 'Uriah', 'Heep', 'shorn', 'most', 'storyline', 'magnetic', 'oiliness', 'character', 'still', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'Nicholas', 'Lyndhurst', 'Additionally', 'Murdstones', 'who', 'form', 'brilliant', 'Alpha', 'Omega', 'thematic', 'line', 'David', 'book', 'are', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'second', 'half', 'miniseries.Also', 'featuring', 'charming', 'Ian', 'MacNiece', 'simpleminded', 'wise', 'Mr.', 'Dick', 'production', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'hearty', 'intelligence', 'mostly', 'poorly', 'adapted', 'screenplay']",N/A

Peggotty has been an old friend of mine since junior high school but never had I opened the book, though I have the complete works of Charles Dickens in my library, and never had I seen any screen adaptation of it before tonight. So I just discovered this fine story in my old age, and in a way I regret it.Of course there are orphans and in this case even, David Copperfield is orphaned before his birth. Of course there are step parents who are absolutely obnoxious and brutal. Of course there is a school for boys who are treated like dogs and beaten like trash. Of course there are strict and painful social situations that lead to prison, begging, being robbed and whatever you can imagine, especially when you are a nice young boy, too pure to be true and too nave to be serious.But even the factory in which David Copperfield is forced to work at the early age of ten or eleven looks like paradise when compared with the stepfather and his dear sister, two goal-keepers and nothing else. And that's the miracle of Dickens. He transforms an absolutely bleak situation into a rose garden, or if you prefer the crazy crushing life of a boy into a school for gentility and success.That's the mystery and miracle Dickens cultivates in all his books. No matter how horrible life may be, and be sure he remained discreet about the worst details, he turns it into a happy ending and a success story. And that's how a forlorn and abandoned orphan will be able to cut a position for himself under the sun and in society.People could say Dickens was a blind optimist, but he was not blind at all and knew about the sinister life we live in. We could say he is a hypocrite writing stories about the dregs of society to sell them to and make money from the rich and wealthy minority that could read and afford the serials or books, and what's more to cover up with happy endings the terrible fate of most working people and children in this Victorian society. And we would be wrong.Dickens' books are a testimony of what Victorian society was and a great lesson given to those who had and still have the power and the money necessary to change things that change cannot be stopped because there will always be a few who will be strong enough or lucky enough to climb up to a position from which they may influence the world. In fact he thinks he is one of these and he is telling us book after book the same story of the enterprising young man who will change the world with his words and mind.It is optimistic for sure but heart warming even more, and this BBC adaptation is just perfect as for that brittle equilibrium between social criticism and human advancement.Dr Jacques COULAREDEAU",5,Bleaker than nature,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,2781,"['story', 'such', 'classic', 'anyone', 'must', 'know', 'having', 'ever', 'read', 'just', 'Peggotty', 'been', 'old', 'friend', 'mine', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'never', 'had', 'opened', 'book', 'have', 'complete', 'works', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'library', 'never', 'had', 'seen', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'tonight', 'just', 'discovered', 'fine', 'story', 'old', 'age', 'way', 'regret', 'it.Of', 'course', 'are', 'orphans', 'case', 'even', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'orphaned', 'birth', 'course', 'are', 'step', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'absolutely', 'obnoxious', 'brutal', 'course', 'school', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'treated', 'dogs', 'beaten', 'trash', 'course', 'are', 'strict', 'painful', 'social', 'situations', 'lead', 'prison', 'begging', 'being', 'robbed', 'can', 'imagine', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'nice', 'young', 'boy', 'too', 'pure', 'be', 'true', 'too', 'nave', 'be', 'serious.But', 'even', 'factory', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'forced', 'work', 'early', 'age', 'ten', 'eleven', 'paradise', 'when', 'compared', 'stepfather', 'dear', 'sister', 'two', 'goal-keepers', 'nothing', 'else', 'miracle', 'Dickens', 'absolutely', 'bleak', 'situation', 'rose', 'garden', 'prefer', 'crazy', 'crushing', 'life', 'boy', 'school', 'gentility', 'success.That', 'mystery', 'miracle', 'Dickens', 'books', 'matter', 'how', 'horrible', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'be', 'sure', 'remained', 'discreet', 'worst', 'details', 'happy', 'ending', 'success', 'story', 'how', 'forlorn', 'abandoned', 'orphan', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'cut', 'position', 'sun', 'society.People', 'could', 'say', 'Dickens', 'was', 'blind', 'optimist', 'was', 'not', 'blind', 'knew', 'sinister', 'life', 'live', 'could', 'say', 'hypocrite', 'writing', 'stories', 'dregs', 'society', 'sell', 'make', 'money', 'rich', 'wealthy', 'minority', 'could', 'read', 'afford', 'serials', 'books', 'what', 'more', 'cover', 'up', 'happy', 'endings', 'terrible', 'fate', 'most', 'working', 'people', 'children', 'Victorian', 'society', 'would', 'be', 'wrong.Dickens', 'books', 'are', 'testimony', 'what', 'Victorian', 'society', 'was', 'great', 'lesson', 'given', 'who', 'had', 'still', 'have', 'power', 'money', 'necessary', 'change', 'things', 'change', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'stopped', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'few', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'strong', 'enough', 'lucky', 'enough', 'climb', 'up', 'position', 'may', 'influence', 'world', 'fact', 'one', 'telling', 'book', 'book', 'same', 'story', 'enterprising', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'change', 'world', 'words', 'mind.It', 'optimistic', 'sure', 'heart', 'warming', 'even', 'more', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'just', 'perfect', 'brittle', 'equilibrium', 'social', 'criticism', 'human', 'advancement.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULAREDEAU']",N/A

The casting decisions were spot-on. I will never be able to read the novel again without seeing in my mind Maggie Smith as Betsey Trotwood, Michael Elphick  as Barkis, Bob Hoskins as Micawber, Ian McNeice  as Mr. Dick, Clare Holman as Rosa Dartle, Nicholas Lyndhurst as Uriah Heep and Amanda Ryan as Agnes Wickfield. They were almost exactly as I envisioned them. Just a few of the characters missed the mark for me; for instance, I thought that Steerforth should be much more slick and handsome - more like Jude Law.The dialogue and narrative stayed very true to the book. The homes and streets in which the movie was set varied from slums to sumptuous upper class homes. The rickety weathered boat in which the Peggotty clan resided was just as I imagined it would be.The story veered from blissful happiness, in which the settings were light and bright and colorful; to dismal, dreary and dark days, when all color was gone and the world was gray. The colorful characters retained all their charming quirks. Micawber rambled on, then summed up his monologues by saying ""In short..."" Mrs. Micawber ""never would leave him"". Barkis, a man of few words, offered forth the shortest marriage proposal ever heard: ""Barkis is willing"".The unctuous Uriah Heep was exceedingly humble. Mr. Murdstone was murderously mean to David and his sweet mother. Clare Peggotty had a heart as big as her derriere :)Though the movie is 3 hours in length, it still cannot contain all of the detail of the 750+ page book. I did notice the absence of a few characters from the book such as Tommy Traddles and Mrs. Mowcher; but their absence didn't really detract from the story.If Charles Dickens could time travel to the modern era, he would surely love this version of his fictionalized life story in which David Copperfield certainly is the hero of his own life.

584006,AUS6TP9X0WI05,B00005JHCP,"Lawrence G Coatney ""Geno""","[34, 43]","Being a fan of the classic by Dickens, (it is in my top ten), I was naturally inclined to want to see the movie versions of this wonderful work of literature.Actaully I had seen one on A&E;, and while I don't really remember much about it, I did enjoy it enough to have a desire to read the book. Ah, contentment. Nothing like a well written novel. I enjoyed it so much, I decided to read it out loud to my wife, something that we love to do with great works that are written in a style that just begs to be spoken. There is something about it that just brings an enrichment to the stories that can sometimes be missed otherwise.Anyhow, after this treasured experience, we both wanted to see the A&E; version. But try as I might, I couldn't find it released on DVD or VHS. So I turned to the altenatives. I read the reviews for this BBC version right here on Amazon, and I must say I was impressed. Almost every review was a good one, and much was said about how close this was to the book. The people who had seen this and the A&E; version even told me this was much superior.So I happily plunked down the money for this movie. We invited our friend Ian who had recently pleasured himself by reading the book. We watched. By the time it was over I was wishing that I hadn't read all those reviews. False hope and all that dashed nonsense. I also wished that I had seen this before reading the book. (I know that by saying this I am totally contradicting my review of Austen's book ""Northanger Abbey"", but in this case I was wrong.) Not that it is a bad movie, but like my wife said, ""It was just a skeleton of the book"".So I shall give a list of the things I didn't like, followed by those that I did.1. The movie just whizzed by from scene to scene, as if they were in a hury to get to the end. Three hours is three hours, but a good director, coupled with nice editing can make a movie feel smoother and seem longer, without giving you that ancy feeling you could be doing something else.2. There were quite a few well written characters missing, or just having brief cameos. Some of the missing who were in my mind vital to the story: Traddle, Dora' two birdlike aunts, and Doctor and Mrs. Strong. Not so important, but still missed by me: The Old Soldier (Mrs. Markleham), Mr Omer, Mr. Joram, And the unforgetable Miss Mowcher.3. The scene where everyone confronts Uriah Heep is way to short. It felt like it took all of about a minute, where as in the book it took up almost an entire chapter, fiiled with rich speech from all the characters, most notably Micawber, who couldn't say the name Heep without going almost into a fit of rage, while here he says Heep that way maybe twice, then mellowing out his tone for the rest of the scene.4. I don't like how they split the DVD like you are watching it on PBS by having the credits halfway through, then you get to watch a preview of what you are going to watch in a few minutes, and then a rehash of what you just watched. Maddening!Good points.1. While there was a lot left out, they didn't deviate from the storyline hardly at all.2. Seeing David's aunt tearing into the Murdstones was almost perfect.3. Mr. Dick was just how I imagined him, especially in the kite flying scene with him twirling his cane in the air with his childish excitement. Seeing David's smile during this scene was very nice to.4. Most notable performances: the young David (an awesome career lies ahead of this boy), Peggotty, Mr. Peggotty, Ham (especially when talking of his love for Emily), Mr. Micawber (while not how I imagined him, was still excellently done), Mrs. Micawber, Miss Trotwood, Uriah Heep (definatly portraying sinister), and Rosa Darttle.I would recomend this movie to a few select groups. If you are curious and have read the book, then I would say, try to rent or borrow this before purchasing. Who knows you might like it. Or if you are a collector of great literary books brought to life, and finally, if you have never read the book, then try watching this and see if you want to read it then.I would not recomend letting children view this until you yourself have screened it and decided its ok, because there are some scenes that could be very disturbing to youngters, and the first half of the movie has a dark feel about it as well.My only hope is that someday soon, someone will put up the money for a proper mini-series to be done. Something in the range of six to ten hours would be nice. And it can be done.

David was born three months after the death of his father, of the same name. Great-Aunt Betsey Trotwood arrived at the home anticipating a girl, is horrified that it's a boy, and immediately leaves. David grows up loved and cared for by his mother and their maid. However, when David is eight his mother marries a stern man who dislikes David and quickly dominates the household. When the stepfather canes David for being unable to answer difficult homework question, David bites him severely and is sent to an abusive boarding school.David's mother dies and David is then sent to work in a London black ink factory while living with one of the stepfather's friend. This man treats David like his own son but ends up in a debtor's prison and can no longer house David. David runs away to Dover in the hope that Betsey Trotwood will take him in. Surprisingly, she does and is very supportive to David. He completes his schooling while staying with a friend of Betsey's (Mr. Wickfield), and then is apprenticed to a lawyer as a clerk.Eventually David marries Dora, the lawyer's daughter, who turns out to be an 'airhead.'

584008,AMX4202M7D7HV,B00005JHCP,"M. Secaur ""Meredith Secaur""","[1, 1]","""David Copperfield"" is something of a modern fairy-tale. The titular character, like so many other heroes, is a boy born into tragedy. His father dies before he his even born, and while he lives a relatively happy life for the first eight years or so with his mother and Peggotty, the kindly servant of the Copperfield family, his fragile existence is shattered when his mother remarries a horrible, controlling man named Edward Murdstone, who becomes the quintessential ""evil stepfather"". He and his sister take over the household, taking advantage of Mrs. Copperfield and abusing David mercilessly with corporal punishment. David endures horrific tenures at a boarding school, beatings by his step-father, and the pain of losing his mother to illness before he is sent away to paste labels on jars of bootblack at a factory....and that's just part 1!Part 2 is nonetheless fraught with troubles, and follows him as he makes his way through adulthood and confronts the tragedies and joys that come with it. The character of David Copperfield has always been one of my favorites from any of Dicken's books. He does not make his own story, but has his story shaped by the actions of those around him. His steadfast resoluteness in the face of adversity is admirable, if not inspiring, and his diligence and aspiration for something more in life, no matter how low he has sunk, ultimately leads him to his own ""happily ever after""; not like Pip in ""Great Expectations"", who largely comes to nothing because of his own shortcomings.The story is typically Dickensian, with dirty London streets, heart-tugging tragedy, and plenty of cruel adults who wreak their vengeance upon innocent children. There are light moments, of course, and as far as plot goes, this one isn't nearly as dark and bleak as ""Great Expectations"" or ""Oliver Twist"". For one thing, it actually has a good ending for just about everyone, a rarity in most of Dicken's other works.The BBC evidentially put a ton of time and money into this production. Everything looks so authentic, from the sets down to the costumes. Much of it was filmed on location, and even what wasn't still appears in perfect continuity to the time period. The score, composed by Robert Lane and interspersed with several classical pieces, is simply beautiful, and avoids sounding either cheap or overproduced for a film of this scale.If you've been turned off by previous Masterpiece productions because of their lack of proper casting, than you'll be pleasantly surprised by this one. Everyone is perfect for their parts, and give solid, believable performances. Many will criticize for the abundance of British film royalty, but the way I see it, the reason those people are so famous in the first place is because they're so talented, and when you're trying to adapt a Charles Dickens novel, you need good actors to do the job. Some of the standouts include Maggie Smith as Aunt Betsey Trotwood, Bob Hoskins and Imelda Staunton as the irrepressible Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, Pauline Quirke as Peggotty, and Amanda Ryan as Agnes. Nicholas Lynhurst gives a suitably slimy performance as Uriah Heep, and becomes a villain you want to hate. Ian McKellan is equally as despisable as the vicious headmaster, Mr. Creakle.As for David Copperfield himself, Daniel Radcliffe gives an astoundingly good performance in the first part of this film as young David. He was only ten at the time, but is as good or better than most of the adults, and plays his part with an incredible amount of pathos and emotion. The looks in his eyes are truly those of an old soul in a child's body. How anyone could even pretend to be cruel to him is beyond me. Because of him, Part 1 is made even more compelling. That may account for the slight let-down feel of Part 2. Oh well. If only they had been able to find an actor as talented as him to play David as an adult, then this production would have been absolutely perfect.All in all, this is the best PBS Masterpiece production I have ever seen, and certainly one of the best Dickens adaptations. If you like good, well-produced British drama, don't fail to see ""David Copperfield"".

A waste of film to be blunt. The other performers shine and Bob Hoskins as Mr. Micawber was an ideal choice.

584015,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B00005JHCP,Russell Fanelli,"[39, 41]","The first half of David Copperfield was good enough, I think, to please Dickens himself.  This is due in part to the excellent portrayal of young David by Daniel Radcliffe, who provides just the right amount of spunk and vulnerability to do justice to the character.  Treavor Eve is also excellent as David's nemesis, his stepfather, Murdstone.  Just a look from Eve's Murdstone is enough to frighten David first into silence and then, as he is being savagely beaten for failing his lessons,  into instinctive rebellion, biting Murdstone's hand.  For this crime David is sent to Murstone's blacking factory in London.  The blacking factory is a dreadful place and would certainly have broken David's spirit and ruined his life if it were not for the introduction of Mr. Micawber, his guardian in London, exceptionally well played by the talented Bob Hoskins.This great novel is filled with a variety of subplots, many of which are included in the film.  Three that are worth mentioning are David's flight from the blacking factory and his journey to his Aunt Betsey Trotwood, beautifully performed by the great English actress Maggie Smith.  Aunt Betsey takes David in and champions his cause in a dramatic scene where she throws out Murdstone and his sister Jane from her home.  Aunt Betsey then takes David to live with a lawyer and his daughter Agnes and the lawyer's evil clerk Uriah Heep, who pretends to be humble yet never stops scheming to steal everything the lawyer owns.  In another great scene, Macawber, now working for Heap, confronts the villain as a Heap of infamy.  This dramatic encounter is the climax of the film.  Lastly, another story worth mentioning concerns David's nanny Peggotty.  She and her family are betrayed by Steerforth, a boy that befriended David in his first school and who saved him from the dreadful headmaster Mr. Creakle, wonderfully played by Ian McKellen.Unfortunately, when David grows up the story loses some of its force and energy.  The adult David, Ciaran McMenamin, is the weakest actor in the cast.  Even so, the story is so well dramatized that I found myself engaged from beginning to end.David Copperfield is a long book and four hours is not quite enough time to do it justice, but what the producers have included is done well and will certainly give viewers a good sense of the exceptionally varied and entertaining cast of characters in a story, somewhat autobiographical, that Dickens himself considered his favorite and best work.

The story in the movie stayed close to the book, with the exception that several characters such as Dr. Strong, Thomas Traddle were eleminated from teh story. Which I thought was a bit odd, because these characters were great to the story. It is argued that David Copperfield himself is rather a dull character with no strong personality and that what makes Dicken's book wonderful are the David's surrounding characters. This argument was well presented in the movie because the actor who played adult David Copperfield had a relatively dull camera time than rest of the roles. He didn't seem to have much freedom to express any of his emotions in front of the camera. My favorite character is David's aunt Betsy Trotwood, both in the book and in the movie.

McKinney,"[2, 2]","I am a private tutor who teaches classes in British and American literature, and I have never been so thrilled as when I came across this version of David Copperfield. The Brit Lit classes I teach are surveys, and everyone knows that in a survey class, there's just not enough time to read everything. You kind of have to hit the high points and move on.Which is why excellent video productions of great literature are so much appreciated by me and other teachers. The actual novel David Copperfield is a thick, weighty book; if it were presented in class, the students would have to read it at such a pace, they'd hardly be able to enjoy it. That's where this DVD comes in.This production is absolutely wonderful. The star-packed cast takes the movie forward from the very first scene and does not stop through all of David's joys and sorrows until the lovely happy ending. The sets, scenery and costuming are perfect.Have plenty of tissues available, though, because, like the novel, this movie will move you to both sad and happy tears.

I couldn't help but think about how parts of it paralleled his life and how he depicted his experiences. It makes it feel more human.Dicken's was the father of soap opera. He had a talent for telling several different stories, weaving them in and out of each other, but not showing you the big reveal of how they all fit until the very end. He's masterful at that. Unfortunately, David Copperfield is not one of those types of stories. I think it feels less interesting than some of the others for that reason (hence the 4 stars).The cast is STELLAR. They all do a fabulous job of becoming their characters, but the characters- like most of Dicken's characters- are pretty one dimensional. There is always a ""good one"" who has the action happen to him rather than acting on the world. (That's David Copperfield in this movie). There is always a ""bad one"" who gets it in the end. This is predictable in that way, but you still can't help but be carried away with it and love the story. Or at least that is how it played out with me. I loved the way that different strata of society were all shown that would not have normally interacted with each other. I think it makes it so much richer than just dealing with one slice of life.Great cast. Great costuming. Great story.
