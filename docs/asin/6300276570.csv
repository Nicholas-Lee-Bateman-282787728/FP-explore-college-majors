240580,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6300276570,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 7]","Did I like Ruthless People?  That is a tough question and just like every good story, there are two sides.  On the positive side, I miss this type of comedy in cinema today.  I miss the physical humor, the goofiness, and the instant creativity that could be seen behind the camera.  In today's movie world, this is normally cluttered with ""fart"" jokes and sexual innuendo.  I miss the comedies of the 80s; there was some innocence to them.  Perhaps it was that warm fuzzy feeling that they always left you with (no matter if you were rooting for the bad guy or the good guy) or maybe it was the actors of that era.  The youth of today do not have actors like Danny DeVito (who can now be found most of the time producing films), Bette Midler, Bill Pullman (pre-Independence Day), and especially the infamous Judge Reinhold.  What would my generation be like without the shenanigans of Judge?  His humor was so perfect that if I were going to make a movie today, he would be cast no matter what.  I would also like to add that Danny DeVito was superb in this film.  His ability to play the ruthless, soulless, anti-hero was amazing.  He had me grinning from ear to ear whenever he was on screen.Another great aspect was the stories.  They were simple, yet imaginative.  They were stupid, yet somewhat funny.  They were incoherent, yet always ended on a happy note.  Look at the story behind Ruthless People and look at the stories in today's modern cinema ... see any similarities?  I surely do not.  There was something just plain 80s about the standoff scene with Reinhold, DeVito, and Pullman that could not be done the same today.  There would be CGI or unmasking, or anything that would detract from the main focus of this film ... the actors.  Films of this era were focused on the actors, that is what sold the movie and made it popular.  Today, I wish we could say the same.  Now it is all about the CGI and the explosions.  It is very rare that you find a very actor centered comedy and for this I will forever be sad.As I stated above, there are two sides to every story.  While I did enjoy the actors in this film and the imagination, there was something that tugged me the wrong way and that was story overloading.  There was too much happening in this film.  I totally disliked the side story with the Bedroom killer.  I honestly felt as if this could have (and should have) been left out of this film.  In a 93 minute film, there was just too much happening.  I didn't feel as if everything had a conclusion.  There were parts still floating up in the air when the final credits rolled.  Carol and Pullman's scenes were important in moving the story, but I didn't feel they ever finalized anything.  The problem that you run into when you try to push this much into 93 minutes is under developing some possible funny parts.  I could have used some pre-story on the Kesslers and even some more information on the random killer.  The quickness of this film also lead to a quick ending for DeVito when I was finally starting to see the brilliance behind his character.I say this, but perhaps this is what the 80s comedy was all about.  An undeveloped story coupled with amazing comedic actors make for a decent film.  Possibly, but it still doesn't make Ruthless People rank up there with the likes of Ghostbusters and Quick Change.Overall, this was a decent film.  I first thought that it wasn't the greatest, but the ending knocked it up a notch.  The DVD quality really wasn't the best, but I guess we are more concerned about the extra 50 minutes on LoTR instead of refurbishing some of our classics.Grade: *** out of *****",3,"My only regret, Carol, is that the plan isn't more violent.",1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,3637,"['Did', 'like', 'Ruthless', 'People', 'tough', 'question', 'just', 'good', 'story', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'positive', 'side', 'miss', 'type', 'comedy', 'cinema', 'today', 'miss', 'physical', 'humor', 'goofiness', 'instant', 'creativity', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'camera', 'today', 'movie', 'world', 'normally', 'cluttered', 'fart', 'jokes', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'miss', 'comedies', '80s', 'was', 'innocence', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'always', 'left', 'matter', 'were', 'rooting', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'guy', 'maybe', 'was', 'actors', 'era', 'youth', 'today', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'actors', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'who', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'found', 'most', 'time', 'producing', 'films', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'pre-Independence', 'Day', 'especially', 'infamous', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'What', 'would', 'generation', 'be', 'shenanigans', 'Judge', 'humor', 'was', 'so', 'perfect', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'cast', 'matter', 'what', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'add', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'was', 'superb', 'film', 'ability', 'play', 'ruthless', 'soulless', 'anti-hero', 'was', 'amazing', 'had', 'grinning', 'ear', 'ear', 'was', 'screen.Another', 'great', 'aspect', 'was', 'stories', 'were', 'simple', 'yet', 'imaginative', 'were', 'stupid', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'were', 'incoherent', 'always', 'ended', 'happy', 'note', 'Look', 'story', 'Ruthless', 'People', 'look', 'stories', 'today', 'modern', 'cinema', 'see', 'similarities', 'surely', 'do', 'not', 'was', 'something', 'just', 'plain', '80s', 'standoff', 'scene', 'Reinhold', 'DeVito', 'Pullman', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'same', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'CGI', 'unmasking', 'anything', 'would', 'detract', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'actors', 'Films', 'era', 'were', 'focused', 'actors', 'what', 'sold', 'movie', 'made', 'popular', 'Today', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'Now', 'CGI', 'explosions', 'very', 'rare', 'find', 'very', 'actor', 'centered', 'comedy', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'sad.As', 'stated', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'story', 'did', 'enjoy', 'actors', 'film', 'imagination', 'was', 'something', 'tugged', 'wrong', 'way', 'was', 'story', 'overloading', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'happening', 'film', 'totally', 'disliked', 'side', 'story', 'Bedroom', 'killer', 'honestly', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'film', '93', 'minute', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'happening', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'everything', 'had', 'conclusion', 'were', 'parts', 'still', 'floating', 'up', 'air', 'when', 'final', 'credits', 'rolled', 'Carol', 'Pullman', 'scenes', 'were', 'important', 'moving', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ever', 'finalized', 'anything', 'problem', 'run', 'when', 'try', 'push', 'much', '93', 'minutes', 'developing', 'possible', 'funny', 'parts', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'pre-story', 'Kesslers', 'even', 'more', 'information', 'random', 'killer', 'quickness', 'film', 'also', 'lead', 'quick', 'ending', 'DeVito', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'starting', 'see', 'brilliance', 'character.I', 'say', 'perhaps', 'what', '80s', 'comedy', 'was', 'about', 'undeveloped', 'story', 'coupled', 'amazing', 'comedic', 'actors', 'make', 'decent', 'film', 'Possibly', 'still', ""n't"", 'make', 'Ruthless', 'People', 'rank', 'there', 'likes', 'Ghostbusters', 'Quick', 'Change.Overall', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'first', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'ending', 'knocked', 'up', 'notch', 'DVD', 'quality', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'guess', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'extra', '50', 'minutes', 'LoTR', 'instead', 'refurbishing', 'classics.Grade', '***', '*****']",N/A

Sam is tired of living with her and all of her disgusting habits, so he confides in his mistress (yes, that's right, his MISTRESS) that he plans to kill his rich wife and inherit her money.

But the naive couple don't realise that they have done Sam a big favour because when they threaten to kill her if he doesn't pay the ransom, or if he calls the police and media he thinks they're serious.

While the scenes I had fondly remembered still paid off handsomely, there were MANY others that are just terrific.  For example, the scene with the money payoff at the plaza when Sam Stone (Danny DeVito) pulls a gun on Ken Kessler (Judge Reinhold) to take his ransom money back and the police (dozens of them) tell him to put the gun and case down.  Then, as Ken is getting ready to drive off up rolls Earl Mott (Bill Pullman) to steal the ransom money.  Earl's behavior when confronted by the police is stunningly wonderful and we cheer when one of the cops notes that Earl must be the stupidest man on the face of the Earth and that they maybe should shoot him.The title refers to three pairs of ruthless people.  Sam Stone is the ""spandex mini-skirt king"" and has made millions.  While he pretends to be devoted to his wife, Barbara (Bette Midler), whose name he delightfully mis-pronounces with a kind of ""w"" for the last ""r"", he actually hates her and at the beginning of the movie is planning to kill her to get access to her fortune (which is many times what he has made with his mini-skirts).  He is also having an affair with Carol Dodsworth (Anita Morris), who is probably the most ruthless person in the film.  She pretends to care about Sam, but is really only interested in getting at his money and isn't above blackmail, murder, or anything else.  However, she has taken the aforementioned moron, Earl Mott, has her henchman.

They work so well as a dysfunctional couple it's scary!  The script and plot for this movie are predominantly well-done....and just original enough to make it sparkle.  Judge Rhinehold is great as the average joe who kidnaps Bette so he can demand a ransome from DeVito in order to get revenge...because Danny ripped him off on a business deal and made a fortune!  The only problem is, Danny was going to kill his wife anyway.  So, he refuses to pay the ransome, and goes out of his way to not follow any of the kidnappers demands.  Even when the kidnappers lower their price, Danny just won't play ball!  Anita Morris does a wonderful job in the role of Danny's conniving, unscrupulous lover who wants to blackmail DeVito with a video of his wife's murder.  There are plenty of plot twists and interesting alleys that are traversed to keep this zany comedy entertaining.  And since so many people in the world really are this self-obsessed and ""ruthless"", this is a very funny mirror held up to human nature.

First of all, the plot is hilarious.Sam Stone (Danny De Vito) is the disgruntled husband of heiress Bette Midler.  Sam has a nice stack of cash of his own, yet, like the greedy man he is, he wants more.  And there is only one way to get it.  Kill off his rich wife.  He has it all planned out.  Yet little does he know that there are two people out there who will inadvertently do him a favor by kidnapping his wife and, if he won't pay off the ransom, they'll kill her for him.  So all Sam has to do now is sit back and wait. There is only one problem.  These kidnappers, while they claim to be ""ruthless people"", are really a couple of softies who, when they see a bug in their house, will scoop it up and place it gently outside the door.  When they threaten to kill Mrs. Stone, they hardly mean what they say.  Half the fun of watching this movie is seeing the scenes where Sam is on the phone with the kidnappers, seething because they are willing to give him chance after chance to get them the money, even after several stubborn refusals.Bette Midler, as Sam Stone's wife, is very funny in her role as hostage, and Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater do a great job as her captors.  The performances are the second thing this movie has going for it.

Don't read the convoluted plot synopsis provided by Amazon.

Fortunately for him, on the day he plans to take her out, Judge Reinhold and his wife kidnap Midler's character to get ransom and to get back at Devito for stealing their fashion ideas.  Great!  Now all Devito has to do is refuse to pay the ransom and go against all the kidnappers' demands, and his little problem will be solved!  It's not so simple, and the plot turns crazy from that point, with some crosses and double-crosses, extortion of the chief of police, dumb boy-toy boyfriends, adulterous affairs, disturbed neighborhood serial killers, and clown suits.The cast in this movie is amazing.  Midler stands out the most, as a woman who goes through a metaphorphasis during her kidnapping.  Reinhold is the perfect balance of a genuinely nice guy who wants so hard to be a ruthless criminal.

He is Sam Stone, a pint-size slimeball who gets rich off stealing others' ideas.  Only this time, he's stolen from the wrong person, a gentle housewife named Sandy Kessler, whose enraged husband, Ken, is about to fix the slimeball's wagon once and for all.

Trouble is, Sam hates his wife because he's cavorting with his mistress Carol (who in turn is cheating on him with another man), and sees the kidnap threat as a heaven-sent way of getting rid of his wife.  Send the ransom?  You gotta be kidding.  Why go through a messy divorce when you can be a bereaved widower with a fat bank account?

Before he can commit the crime, she is kidnapped by a married couple that Stone had cheated years earlier.  The kidnappers (Judge Reinhold & Helen Slater) demand a ransom or threaten to kill her but Stone's only interest is in provoking them into doing just that.  To add a little spice to the mix, Stone also has a mistress who wants to blackmail him for the murder that she still believes he's committed.  All of this happens within the first ten minutes of the movie and things get more complicated from there.Sam Stone and his wife both live up to the movie title superbly.  Danny DeVito is perfect as a ruthless, conniving S.O.B. who will stop at nothing, including murder, to get what he wants.  Bette Midler plays Barbara as a holy terror to her kidnappers and torments them in every way possible.  She taunts and berates them, and deals out a good deal of physical punishment as well.  Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater are probably the world's nicest kidnappers as they try to get their money while providing Barbara with home cooked meals and a freshly cleaned room of her own including a television and workout equipment.  Bill Pullman makes his movie debut here in a small but funny role as yet another person trying to squeeze a buck out of the situation.The story probably wouldn't hold up to major scrutiny but for a comedy it's more than solid enough.  There are some very funny moments in the film, many involving Midler and the kidnappers, and most of the rest isn't bad.  A few bits do fall with a bit of a thud, but these are the exception, not the rule.  Ruthless People isn't a great comedy, but it is a good one and the cast is a treat to watch.

I highly recommend this comedy.

Henry story the tables are turned on the kidnappers and they end up paying the parents of the brat they abducted to take him back.No such thing occurs in the latter films where the spouses of the kidnapped victims gets their just deserts and the kidnappers are rewarded in the end.

Hysterical.  For a mid-80s comedy, it still packs a punch.  Danny DeVito and Bette Middler are classic.  DeVito is Sam Stone, a scumbag clothing mogul who stole the idea of the spandex miniskirt and made millions!  Bette Middler is his spoiled wife, Barbara, who gets kidnapped by Helen Slater (the woman who actually designed the spandex miniskirt) and Judge Reinhold and winds up losing weight and growing a conscience.  Stone was planning to kill his wife, who he detests,  when she gets kidnapped before he can do it.  Perfect.  Problem solved.  That is until they arrest Stone for her murder and he needs her back to prove his innocence.  Devito plays such a perfect assh*le when he wants to.  This is 80s comedy at its best.  If I can still laugh at it all these years later, it's funny.  And the fashions from the 80s represented hereare outlandish!  This DVD is definitely worth the money.
