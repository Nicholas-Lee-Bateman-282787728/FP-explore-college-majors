237796,A36H16ZJXUIMZG,6300271315,"Gene Cisco ""Moon Man""","[1, 1]","Others ponder why the delay of release in this great depiction of Marine boot camp, pre-Stanley Kubrick. Perhaps, because this great film depicts what is missing from our schools: regimentation, ranking by performance, standards of excellence,rote memorization (repetition), belittling individuals (for purpose), then you have the precise standards of dress, personal cleanliness,discipline and lastly respect for one's country, then the corps. Espirit de corps it's called, which creates self-respect and confidence, instead of padded advance-placement ""grades."" Of course, one could accuse Jack Webb of a lack of diversity compared to today. But this is the movie that captured the typical marine or navy personnel in the 50's and 60's that I experienced and witnessed. This black-and-white, taut, bluntly realistic peek of that marine corps is the standard I measure all subsequent war movies against. Few in the last 20 years measure up. Jack Webb's production stands alongside ""Porkchop Hill."" In fact, to create an equivalent to ""Full Metal Jacket,"" one only needs to watch ""The D.I."" followed by ""Pork Chop Hill."" In my view, together they make a more complete ""Jacket."" The public martinet with private doubts that Jack Webb embodies in his D.I. , stern without being profane, rings true as a classic because of Webb's insistence on touches of weakness. (In the early 70's this film was redone in color as ""Tribes,"" starring Darren McGavin in Webb's part and Jan Michael Vincent as the misunderstood ""hippie"" recruit with inner strengths. Knowing how the ""entitled"" ""wireless"" generation may prefer their realism in color, I bet the studios prefer that one; but the psychedelic camera touches make that one dated)This is the real deal, which ties the corps to tradition and high standards of conduct with a subplot like ""the little engine that could"" with a little encouragement, while it avoids falling into the anti-war camp making no bones about being between wars. But it is a real motivator if you want to be a part of the few, the proud and the prepared. Whether it was the start of the day or the end of the day, a marine's uniform was crisply pressed with gleaming boots. No slovenly Jack Nicholson's on display here.

Because of Ribbon Creek Incident at Paris Island in 1956, no hitting of foul language was allowed toward recruits.  Officers supervision over drill instructor was greatly increase-not enough to stop the mistreatment of recruits completely. The drill instructors would use intimating tactics to prevent recruits from reporting of mistreatment by drill instructors.  A good book called Incident at Ribbon talk about the events leading up to and after the drowning of marines in ribbon creek. The book talks about what kind of training really works to produce and bond good fighting soldiers together.  I agree with the book it not the beating of recruits to make good soldiers but the leadership in the racks and bonding of small group as friends working and fighting together that produces good fighting soldiers.

She expects a Marine to come home.  That one scene is more a comment on the times than anything else is the movie.Of course, the realism is missing in The D. I.
