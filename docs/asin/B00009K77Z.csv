I loved how the circular fashion that Crazy Little Thing rides on, meeting the same point as it expands its radius as time goes on. It's a nice gimmick. Very fresh and up to the point, Crazy Little Thing works well for being a low-key picture. At the same time, of course Crazy Little Thing is very obsessed with sex, but surprisingly, there was no nudity whatsoever in the whole time. I must say, that hurt Crazy Little Thing as a film. Also, the acting, especially by Jenny McCarthy and Chris Eigeman, is very good. Obviously, I am a sucker for first-person narration, especially when the lead characters speak to the camera as if they are aware that others are watching. It works well for Crazy Little Thing. I am a bit disappointed that there was no nudity at all in the picture, but it doesn't stop Crazy Little Thing from being a romantic picture, particularly when I felt drawn to the idea that I wanted the lead characters to end up together. It actually worked for me while I thought Crazy Little Thing was going to be a cheap picture. But it turned out it was not.",4,"Jeez, I Was Very Impressed.",1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,1157,"['Viewed', '9/06Rate', '89/06', 'Crazy', 'Little', 'Thing', 'clever', 'not', 'snobbish', 'picture', 'loved', 'how', 'circular', 'fashion', 'Crazy', 'Little', 'Thing', 'meeting', 'same', 'point', 'radius', 'time', 'nice', 'gimmick', 'Very', 'fresh', 'up', 'point', 'Crazy', 'Little', 'Thing', 'well', 'being', 'low-key', 'picture', 'same', 'time', 'course', 'Crazy', 'Little', 'Thing', 'very', 'obsessed', 'sex', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'nudity', 'whatsoever', 'whole', 'time', 'must', 'say', 'hurt', 'Crazy', 'Little', 'Thing', 'film', 'Also', 'acting', 'especially', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'Chris', 'Eigeman', 'very', 'good', 'Obviously', 'am', 'sucker', 'first-person', 'narration', 'especially', 'when', 'lead', 'characters', 'speak', 'camera', 'are', 'aware', 'others', 'are', 'watching', 'well', 'Crazy', 'Little', 'Thing', 'am', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'was', 'nudity', 'picture', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Crazy', 'Little', 'Thing', 'being', 'romantic', 'picture', 'particularly', 'when', 'felt', 'drawn', 'idea', 'wanted', 'lead', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'actually', 'worked', 'thought', 'Crazy', 'Little', 'Thing', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'cheap', 'picture', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'not']",Crazy Little Thing

753771,A2JV8PH4NGQPJ6,B00009K77Z,"Sir George Martini ""Verbalosity""","[11, 13]","""Crazy Little Thing"" is an intelligent comedy about relationships.  I'm surprised its not more popular, but that's probably due to it's ""R"" rating.  Whitney (Jenny McCarthy) keeps running into Jimmy (Chris Eigeman) during the movie and they think they despise each other.  Whitney has a crazy neighbor Dee (Drea de Matteo) who helps her figure how to meet men.  Jimmy has a friend who realizes his sexual preference isn't female and he goes through some major changes, while his other friend has a relationship with a girl in High School which is funny and sad at the same time.  Rent or buy it if you haven't seen it, because you probably won't be disappointed if you like this type of humor.",5,"Yes, Jenny McCarthy Can Act",1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,693,"['Crazy', 'Little', 'Thing', 'intelligent', 'comedy', 'relationships', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'not', 'more', 'popular', 'probably', 'due', 'R', 'rating', 'Whitney', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'running', 'Jimmy', 'Chris', 'Eigeman', 'movie', 'think', 'despise', 'other', 'Whitney', 'crazy', 'neighbor', 'Dee', 'Drea', 'de', 'Matteo', 'who', 'figure', 'how', 'meet', 'men', 'Jimmy', 'friend', 'who', 'sexual', 'preference', ""n't"", 'female', 'major', 'changes', 'other', 'friend', 'relationship', 'girl', 'High', 'School', 'funny', 'sad', 'same', 'time', 'Rent', 'buy', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'like', 'type', 'humor']",Crazy Little Thing
