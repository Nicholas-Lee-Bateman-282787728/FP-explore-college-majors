English subtitles are very good.The reason this gets a 3 and not a 5 star rating is because by the 10th or 11th episode I was so sick of the performance of Koo Hye-sun I would roll my eyes every time she was on screen. Stuffing her mouth with food and then talking around the food (happened A LOT) I guess it is supposed to make her endearing and working class, but it was ridiculous after awhile. The way she would yell at the Lee Min-ho character and her parents, the pouting, shuffling her feet when she was trying to be ""cutesy"", the stupid way she would pretend to be surprised and overwhelmed by rich surroundings was just annoying, annoying, annoying. I couldn't understand how three of the shows most ""eligible"" men fell for her. She wasn't even charming. I don't know if that is Koo Hye-sun's fault or the director's, but it brought down my overall enjoyment of the show.As for the rest, most of the cast were good (Jan-di's family were pretty annoying but who can say anything bad about Lee Min-ho except for the hair!), the storyline is good and particularly liked the story line with So Yi-Jung and Chu Ga-eul.Overall recommendation -- buy it, it is worth it.",3,Only a three because I hated Koo Hye-sun's performance,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,1215,"['First', 'quality', 'dvd', 'excellent', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'very', 'good.The', 'reason', '3', 'not', '5', 'star', 'rating', '10th', '11th', 'episode', 'was', 'so', 'sick', 'performance', 'Koo', 'Hye-sun', 'would', 'roll', 'eyes', 'time', 'was', 'screen', 'Stuffing', 'mouth', 'food', 'then', 'talking', 'food', 'happened', 'A', 'LOT', 'guess', 'supposed', 'make', 'endearing', 'working', 'class', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'awhile', 'way', 'would', 'yell', 'Lee', 'Min-ho', 'character', 'parents', 'pouting', 'shuffling', 'feet', 'when', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'cutesy', 'stupid', 'way', 'would', 'pretend', 'be', 'surprised', 'overwhelmed', 'rich', 'surroundings', 'was', 'just', 'annoying', 'annoying', 'annoying', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'three', 'shows', 'most', 'eligible', 'men', 'fell', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'charming', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Koo', 'Hye-sun', 'fault', 'director', 'brought', 'down', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'show.As', 'rest', 'most', 'cast', 'were', 'good', 'Jan-di', 'family', 'were', 'pretty', 'annoying', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'anything', 'bad', 'Lee', 'Min-ho', 'hair', 'storyline', 'good', 'particularly', 'liked', 'story', 'line', 'So', 'Yi-Jung', 'Chu', 'Ga-eul.Overall', 'recommendation', 'buy']",Boys Over Flowers

1503067,A188NTJ5LV8LA4,B005SZ0WJG,Wm19,"[1, 1]","This is the third Korean drama that I watched on Netflix with English subtitles. There are 25 episodes, and each episode is just over an hour long.Lee Min Ho stars as the arrogant, wealthy King bee at an exclusive high school.  He and his 3 friends (the &#34;F4&#34;) rule the school with cruel ruthlessness.  The heroine is a poor commoner who is given a scholarship to the high school for an act of bravery. She is subjected to relentless bullying instigated by the F4 boys. Over time, they realize that she has a heart of gold and they become her staunchest supporters.The hero gets 5 stars for his acting in this 25-episode series. He is perfect as the teenage high school king bee, sneering and snobby and filthy rich. He was very charming and endearing as he learned the pleasures of commoner food such as ramen.The heroine's acting in the first 7 episodes was hard to watch. She has a very narrow face which was usually scrunched up in pouts, sneers, and snivelling expressions that caused her chin and cheeks to have dimples and lines. Combined with the bags under her eyes, her slapstick overacting, her bowl cut hair with straight cut bangs, and deliberate stomping, clumpy gait, she overdid the petulent, childish, ugly duckling part and looked like a 35 year old in a bad wig with bad acting, rather than a spunky but sweet 16 or 17 year old.The initial episodes are about her difficulties fitting in at the new rich school.  As the plot progresses, the characters slowly mature.  As the heroine endures hardship after hardship, her character learns wisdom, stops pouting and snivelling, and as she becomes more reflective, serene, and wise, her acting improves immeasurably.The plot is like a teenage fantasy, a cross between Cinderella and the Ugly Duckling. Poor girl, neither smart or pretty, goes to rich school full of pretty rich people, ends up with the friendship of the four most swoon-worthy guys, and falls in love.Unfortunately, there are many, many, problems with the plot. It jumps from location to location without much explanation. The heroine keeps on starting new jobs, but there is no explanation about what happens to those jobs later on. Does she keep all 5-7 (I lost count) jobs until the end? There are many plots and it's hard to know which character knows what's really going on.  Does the hero know half of what his mother is doing to the heroine? Most of the misunderstandings could have been avoided if the main couple just talked to each other like normal people or friends.  Instead, it takes a very long time for the heroine to finally tell the hero what she decides to do after high school, or for the hero to tell her the problem with his mother. Even the last hour of the series was hard to believe. In the real world, you need ongoing communication to have a decent relationship.The first half of the series, every 1-2 episodes the heroine would fall unconscious (from beating, drowning, being drugged, exhaustion, etc.) or would need otherwise need rescuing from the F4.  Really? How much of a damsel in distress can she be? The only time she stands up for herself is if she is protecting someone else. Otherwise, she just stands there and waits to be hurt.  It helps that one of the F4 has an internal emergency bell that alerts him to go to her whenever she needs rescuing.  No, really, he says that in the story.The first half of the series, the hero is the absolute ruler of his little world.  The latter half he becomes a helpless victim, which was hard to believe.  Also hard to believe is that just having graduated from high school, with no further education, at the age of 19 or 20, he is appointed managing director of the most powerful Korean conglomerate? Really?Initially, the heroine's family was very vulgar, low class, and social climbing in intent.  They were also badly overacting.  It's only as the story unfolds that I could appreciate their love, bonding and generosity with each other. As they endure poverty, starvation and hardship, they became a prime example of what a family should be.I toughed it out and watched all 25 episodes.  It was worth it to watch Lee Min Ho, but the storyline and plot were hard to swallow. I liked that the heroine learned wisdom, acted kindly under fire, and brought a lot of happiness to other people.  The storyline is pretty unrealistic though.For a better series, I'd recommend Secret Garden.
