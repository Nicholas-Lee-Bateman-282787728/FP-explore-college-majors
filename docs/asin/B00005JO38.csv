Everyone is entitled to their own opinions but as I learned as a child if you can't say something good then don't say anything except if it is a ripoff. Such as in no CC's or subtitles for the hearing impaired or poor quality presentation.,5,Please release,1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,306,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'had', 'change', 'channels', 'watch', 'Everyone', 'entitled', 'own', 'opinions', 'learned', 'child', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'something', 'good', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'ripoff', 'Such', 'CC', 'subtitles', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'poor', 'quality', 'presentation']",N/A

I remembered when the 3rd season ended. I never understood what happened to David Strickland's character (i was a naive tween). He just never showed up in the episode then you understood he died, but i thought in the show only..i honestly thought he quit or got fired from the show. Then when I heard he committed suicide, I was floored. I can't wait 'til the first season is released. I always thought he was funny and the show lost it's way in the fourth and final season.I'm looking forward to seeing David Strickland once more.",5,I loved it then..,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,653,"['..i', 'love', 'now', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'was', 'awesome', 'show', 'also', 'introduced', 'favorite', 'comedian', 'Kathy', 'Griffin', 'remembered', 'when', '3rd', 'season', 'ended', 'never', 'understood', 'what', 'happened', 'David', 'Strickland', 'character', 'i', 'was', 'naive', 'tween', 'just', 'never', 'showed', 'up', 'episode', 'then', 'understood', 'died', 'i', 'thought', 'show', 'honestly', 'thought', 'quit', 'got', 'fired', 'show', 'Then', 'when', 'heard', 'committed', 'suicide', 'was', 'floored', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', ""'til"", 'first', 'season', 'released', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'show', 'lost', 'way', 'fourth', 'final', 'season.I', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'David', 'Strickland', 'once', 'more']",N/A

I love Brooke Shields as Susan, the woman who dumps her fiance, and goes back to work at a San Francisco magazine headed by Judd Nelson who is also the brother of the jilted groom. Kathy Griffin shines here as Vicky, the Jewish Red-Headed secretary, who works along side Shields' character. They should have their own show, Vicky and Susan, the unlikeliest of friends. Vicky's mom would be played by Joan Rivers. Anyway, the show was never the best but they also featured David Strickland as the music columnist. Sadly, David Strickland committed suicide during the show's run which explained how the show lost it's edge in it's uneventful final season. The show had also Barbara Barrie as the beloved Granny.",5,What Took It So Long!,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,795,"['missed', 'Suddenly', 'Susan', 'no', 'longer', 'air', 'syndication', 'lifetime', 'anymore', 'love', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'Susan', 'woman', 'who', 'fiance', 'back', 'work', 'San', 'Francisco', 'magazine', 'headed', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'who', 'also', 'brother', 'jilted', 'groom', 'Kathy', 'Griffin', 'shines', 'here', 'Vicky', 'Jewish', 'Red-Headed', 'secretary', 'who', 'along', 'side', 'Shields', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'own', 'show', 'Vicky', 'Susan', 'unlikeliest', 'friends', 'Vicky', 'mom', 'would', 'be', 'played', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'Anyway', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'best', 'also', 'featured', 'David', 'Strickland', 'music', 'columnist', 'Sadly', 'David', 'Strickland', 'committed', 'suicide', 'show', 'run', 'explained', 'how', 'show', 'lost', 'edge', 'uneventful', 'final', 'season', 'show', 'had', 'also', 'Barbara', 'Barrie', 'beloved', 'Granny']",N/A
