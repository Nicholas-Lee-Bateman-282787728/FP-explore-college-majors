This Stand Up is done really well where I thought the material was much longer than an hours (in a very good way).  Some other stand up seems to be wasting time to fill time but Byrne filled this DVD well that it was moving very smoothly and have so many material that it seemed to be longer in comparison to other stand up...once again in a good, entertaining way.",5,Funny guy,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,547,"['3rd', 'DVD', 'Steve', 'Byrne', '1st-Kims', 'Comedy', 'where', 'was', 'excellent', '2nd', 'was', 'Happy', 'Hour', 'was', 'mostly', 'recycled', 'material', 'Kims', 'Comedy', 'not', 'executed', 'well', 'still', 'ok', 'Stand', 'Up', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'where', 'thought', 'material', 'was', 'much', 'longer', 'hours', 'very', 'good', 'way', 'other', 'stand', 'up', 'be', 'wasting', 'time', 'fill', 'time', 'Byrne', 'filled', 'DVD', 'well', 'was', 'moving', 'very', 'smoothly', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'material', 'seemed', 'be', 'longer', 'comparison', 'other', 'stand', 'up', 'once', 'again', 'good', 'entertaining', 'way']",Steve Byrne: The Byrne Identity

From the beginning Steve Byrne is engaging and funny but once he gets rolling...IN TEARS! I pulled a muscle in my side from laughing so hard, I woke nearly all of my neighbours and it's like 3am so bad me but holy crap he is HILARIOUS! Payday later in the week and I am soooo buying this!

There's one joke about African-Americans & Asian-Americans that I love, AND agree with totally.I've always liked Steve Byrne though. I think my fav thing with him that I've seen is a YouTube video. I think he was in the Comedy Factory. That was hilarious!! You'll know it's the one when he makes the joke about ""Spooning"" with women.",4,Pretty good.

1345959,A2CJ5WBHLOOUNG,B003HTPHUE,"Semtex Girl ""FreedomFighter""","[2, 37]","I was watching a bit of this show and then lost interest the moment that he compared the holocaust to the titanic. Its shameful for a grown man this day in age to be so ignorant when he is standing there up against the american flag and can say to the american audience watching that they shouldnt make another holocaust film after shindlers list cause its already been done its like doing another titanic film. Sorry to enlighten you Mr. Byrne but if you had done your homework, and looked up what you were creating 'jokes about' you would see that this is not material for a stand up act, and in your case you are classless. The holocaust saw over 8 million men women and children and even babies, MURDERED. there is more than one story to be told in this atrocity. Shame on you for having this sick mind set and for mocking those lives lost. its people like you that I'm scared will look away when more innocence are brutally robbed of their lives because of prejudice and injustice. I wonder if you would have even bothered to stand up to it if you were born in that era.",1,Steve Byrne misguided and unfunny,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,1075,"['was', 'watching', 'bit', 'show', 'then', 'lost', 'interest', 'moment', 'compared', 'holocaust', 'titanic', 'shameful', 'grown', 'man', 'day', 'age', 'be', 'so', 'ignorant', 'when', 'standing', 'there', 'up', 'american', 'flag', 'can', 'say', 'american', 'audience', 'watching', 'shouldnt', 'make', 'holocaust', 'film', 'shindlers', 'list', 'cause', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'doing', 'titanic', 'film', 'Sorry', 'enlighten', 'Mr.', 'Byrne', 'had', 'done', 'homework', 'looked', 'up', 'what', 'were', 'creating', ""'jokes"", 'would', 'see', 'not', 'material', 'stand', 'up', 'act', 'case', 'are', 'classless', 'holocaust', 'saw', '8', 'million', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'even', 'babies', 'MURDERED', 'more', 'one', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'atrocity', 'Shame', 'having', 'sick', 'mind', 'set', 'mocking', 'lives', 'lost', 'people', ""'m"", 'scared', 'will', 'look', 'away', 'when', 'more', 'innocence', 'are', 'brutally', 'robbed', 'lives', 'prejudice', 'injustice', 'wonder', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'bothered', 'stand', 'up', 'were', 'born', 'era']",Steve Byrne: The Byrne Identity
