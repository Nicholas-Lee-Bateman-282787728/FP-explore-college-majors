1327282,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B00366E1E6,AIROLF,"[6, 7]","Simply stated, ""Mary and Max"" is the perfect film.I watch a lot of movies; on average, I watch at least one movie every other day. I see a lot of great films, which tend to be classics and creme of the crop films that appear on the critics' annual top ten lists. Inevitably,  I also see a lot of bad and mediocre movies.What makes the experience of movie-watching rewarding for me, what I watch for is that effervescent feeling of being surprised and delighted with the storyline of the film so much so that one forgets one's own personal troubles and is literally transplanted into the world of cinema. Such an experience is rare for anyone, but especially for someone who watches movies with the purpose of then dissecting them and blogging about their shortfalls.And yet, when one does come across a gem, a film with integrity, values, and, most importantly, heart, one can not help but gush with admiration. ""Mary and Max"" is the kind of film that stops a person in their tracks and makes them appreciate life. It's the kind of movie that warms the iciest of souls. To borrow from the film itself, ""Mary and Max"" is the kind of movie that  ""makes your brain smile.""Indeed, the film is intelligent mentally and emotionally. Without spoiling the plot, I will say that the friendship, companionship, and love that's shared by the title characters transcends beyond what a moviegoer generally sees and experiences at the theater.How marvelous is ""Mary and Max""? It's been about 30 minutes since I've seen it and I'm itching to watch it again. I have a feeling that it's the kind of film that stands up to repeated viewing and one that truly benefits from them as the jokes and animation deserve more reflection and observation.""Mary and Max"" is the kind of film that makes you think. The kind of movie that makes you cry. The kind of film that makes you laugh. The kind of film that makes me happy to be alive. The kind of movie that restores your belief in humanity.In addition to the skillful stop-motion animation and an impeccable plot, it doesn't hurt that two of the hardest working, most talented actors today have lend their voices for the title characters. Mary is voiced by Toni Colette; whereas Phillip Seymour Hoffman lends his voice for Max.The truth of the matter is that no amount of praise can define the experience of watching the latest stop-motion claymation animated feature. Drop everything and watch it and discover the perfection for yourself.",5,"a very enthusiastic 5 out of 5 stars - you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll remember what it's like to be alive",1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,2466,"['Simply', 'stated', 'Mary', 'Max', 'perfect', 'film.I', 'watch', 'lot', 'movies', 'average', 'watch', 'least', 'one', 'movie', 'other', 'day', 'see', 'lot', 'great', 'films', 'tend', 'be', 'classics', 'creme', 'crop', 'films', 'appear', 'critics', 'annual', 'top', 'ten', 'lists', 'Inevitably', 'also', 'see', 'lot', 'bad', 'mediocre', 'experience', 'movie-watching', 'rewarding', 'what', 'watch', 'effervescent', 'feeling', 'being', 'surprised', 'delighted', 'storyline', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'one', 'own', 'personal', 'troubles', 'literally', 'transplanted', 'world', 'cinema', 'experience', 'rare', 'anyone', 'especially', 'someone', 'who', 'movies', 'purpose', 'then', 'dissecting', 'blogging', 'shortfalls.And', 'yet', 'when', 'one', 'come', 'gem', 'film', 'integrity', 'values', 'most', 'importantly', 'heart', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'gush', 'admiration', 'Mary', 'Max', 'kind', 'film', 'person', 'tracks', 'appreciate', 'life', 'kind', 'movie', 'iciest', 'souls', 'borrow', 'film', 'Mary', 'Max', 'kind', 'movie', 'brain', 'smile', 'Indeed', 'film', 'intelligent', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'spoiling', 'plot', 'will', 'say', 'friendship', 'companionship', 'love', 'shared', 'title', 'characters', 'what', 'moviegoer', 'generally', 'experiences', 'theater.How', 'marvelous', 'Mary', 'Max', 'been', '30', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'m"", 'itching', 'watch', 'again', 'have', 'feeling', 'kind', 'film', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'one', 'truly', 'benefits', 'jokes', 'animation', 'deserve', 'more', 'reflection', 'observation', 'Mary', 'Max', 'kind', 'film', 'think', 'kind', 'movie', 'cry', 'kind', 'film', 'kind', 'film', 'happy', 'be', 'alive', 'kind', 'movie', 'belief', 'humanity.In', 'addition', 'skillful', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'impeccable', 'plot', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'two', 'hardest', 'working', 'most', 'talented', 'actors', 'today', 'have', 'lend', 'voices', 'title', 'characters', 'Mary', 'voiced', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'whereas', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'voice', 'Max.The', 'truth', 'matter', 'amount', 'praise', 'can', 'define', 'experience', 'watching', 'latest', 'stop-motion', 'claymation', 'animated', 'feature', 'Drop', 'everything', 'watch', 'discover', 'perfection']",Mary and Max

That and the good ratings convinced me to give it a try.  I must admit that it was a compelling movie and my wife and I did manage to watch (endure) the whole film.  The claymation and sets were fantastic, albeit dreary.  The story was essentially about a lonely, dysfunctional girl from Australia who finds a friend (pen pal) in New York, who is an elderly, depressed, Jewish man with Asperger's syndrome (and a host of other psychiatric illnesses).  What fun! The message of this film had to do with relationships, and in particular friendships, but many of the characters in the film lived a miserable life whose only salvation was death.  In fact, it's OK to kill yourself if you are old, lonely and have a goiter on your neck.  We found this movie to be disturbing at worse, and depressing at best.  There was sick humor scattered throughout the film which was mildly entertaining at times, especially when the mime got killed.  This was a great film for the study of psychology and psychiatry as it was filled with miserable and/or dysfunctional characters.  But much of the humor was at their expense.  I wanted to like this film, but alas, it left me feeling a bit depressed.  This is really NOT a ""feel good"" movie as far as I'm concerned.  However, this is a poignant and very creative film with an ending that had a nice message.  The critics just loved this film (Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 91%).  The bonus short film included on this DVD (Harvie Krumpet) was on the same lines, but funnier.

Irish ""Read On!""","[3, 3]","When young and friendless Mary picks a name and address from a phone book from someone who lives in the US to ask where babies come from in America, unbeknownst to her, the name she picks to correspond with belongs to a forty-four year old man called Max who lives a very solitary life in New York City.They begin a friendship of sorts in letters from Mary in Australia and Max in New York. Mary's parents are less than perfect and have multitudes of hang ups of their own while in secret Mary asks much advice from over-weight Aspie, Max. Mary's letters to Max usually end up in Max having a rather huge nervous reaction.This is a very interesting and unique claymation movie. It's mature and sensitive and tells a tragic tale of friendship. It's not for young kids as Max's explanations of things to young Mary are frought with adult viewpoints; he has Aspergers and is not able to flower things up.I enjoyed this movie but had not known it would be so sad. It is very sad but uplifting at the same time. I watched it on a cold rainy day which deemed it appropriate for this colorless, grey screened film that has only touches of color with things like Mary's alcoholic mother's bright red lips and a cheery red pom pom that Mary makes Max which he wears on his capped brain.If you like claymation movies this one is tops. It's brilliant. On the same brilliant level it deals with depressing topics such as lonliness, Aspergers, being over-weight and being different than the rest of the world, alcoholism, and it has a message about how sometimes what you are looking for is right there and so much time is spent wanting and seeking perfection in life. This is a good movie but it's not a kids claymation event.

1327298,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,B00366E1E6,Gerard D. Launay,"[38, 38]","One thing animation does very well is give us great art. But what it rarely does is actually create realistic human characters with all their inconvenient imperfections.  This movie does both...and I consider ""Mary and Max"" one of the most daring films of 2009.Those familiar with the animator - Adam Elliot - may recall he won an Oscar for ""Harvie Krumpet"" in the category ofshort animated films.  This film is his major oevre, an expanded version of the shorter film, albeit with different characters.Ostensibly, the story is about a friendship between two unlikely partners.  Max is an overweight, depressed, New York Jew suffering from serious mental illness. Mary is  8 years old, chubby, and confused.  Both are lonely and underappreciated...and through the chance occurrence of a letter from Mary to Max, they develop a deep and realfriendship as pen pals.Now, in many respects, both characters are very flawed human beings.  And that is what makes the film remarkable.  So many animated films from Finding Nemo to Beauty and the Beast end with a successful quest of the hero and heroine. This storyline is far more subtle.  Both Mary and Max battle the everyday troubles of modern life - finding a way to fit in a world when they don't fit in at all. Searching for an influence on this movie in the history of cinema, I might select the Oscar best picture ""Marty"" which filmed a love affair between two ordinary people in the 1950's.I cannot finish the review without saying something about the extraordinary recreation of New York City in ClayMation.

A lot a people who have seen this movie found it very depressing.  It is true that some of the subjects that are treated can be heavy... however, there is some true beauty that emanes from this story.So I finally got a blu-ray unit and bought this title in that format.  When I fist put the movie in the tray, the first thing that I saw were those ugly previews that looked pixelized as some videos you can see on YouTube.  I was kind of afraid that the main movie would have been treated that way.  Then I got to the menu, presed play and I saw again that magnificent movie in a way that it's supposed to be showned.

1327304,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B00366E1E6,Haunted Flower,"[2, 2]","""Mary and Max"" is a claymation feature film written and directed by Adam Elliot that was an Official Selection of the Sundance Film Festival. It tells the story of two lives that change forever after Mary who lives in Melbourne, Australia chooses at random an American name out of a Manhatten address book as a pen pal and enters into an unlikely friendship with Max that turns out to span twenty years.Unlike most claymation films, this is not a children's movie. It is more for a mature audience as over the course of the film the characters write about and deal with alcoholism, kleptomania, religion, depression, agoraphobia, and suicide.Lonely eight-year-old Mary Daisy Dinkle voiced by Bethany Whitmore only finds joy in watching her favorite television show, ""The Noblets"" while consuming sweetened condensed milk since her mother is an alcoholic and cannot stop ""borrowing"" items from the store by stuffing them under her dress and her father hides in a room alone all day drinking Irish Cream. She has a birthmark she is embarrassed about and has trouble making friends until the day she decides to find out more about how life in America is different from her life in Australia. Little did she know she would select someone who needed a friend just as badly as she did.Forty-four-year-old Max Jerry Horovitz voiced by Philip Seymore Hoffman attends Overeaters Anonymous and suffers from Asperger's syndrome that keeps his estranged from others and obsessed with the problem of littering. The strangeness of this new interaction with someone by letter causes him great anxiety due to his condition, but the writing helps him come out of his shell slowly and open up to Mary. By confessing their hopes and dreams and worries to each other, they both move closer to living full-color lives.At times their relationship is estranged due to Mary's growing up, falling in love, and studying psychology to learn more about Max. When Mary grows up, she is voiced by Toni Collette and her romantic interest, Damien is voiced by Eric Bana. The back and forth of their friendship and the trials they both face in their lives are saddening and sobering. They both deal with very serious issues in a slightly humorous way due to the style of claymation. This is a unique film, it's no family-fun Pixar or Dreamworks because even though it has so much funny letter-writing, the story itself is very sad and deals with really serious mental and psychological problems people have. Wait for your children to reach a mature age before sharing this film with them.Bonus Features:There is a making of featurette composed of a series of odd scenes pieced together of the director arriving on a segway and riding the length of the studio to one person destroying a miniature set with a big mallot to a short interview with Eric Bana about how short his part was to someone receiving a ticket from a cop. It is very random and has little to do with the making of this film. The behind the scenes featurette shows the scale of the Manhatten set and close-ups of the puppets and how they function together. It is very interesting to see the challenges of this type of film.The alternate scenes reveal considerably less desirable versions of two of the closing scenes. One so horrific that it is shocking that it was made. There is a casting call showcasing the little girl who plays young Mary, Bethanie Whitmore reading her audition sides. There is an Academy Award-winning short film also written and directed by Adam Elliot in 2003 called ""Harvie Krumpet"" that is narrated by Geoffrey Rush. It is another claymation film serious in subject matter but written and animated in a humerous way to detail one man's life filled with challenges and hardships that inspired ""Mary and Max"".The commentary with Adam Elliot reveals that this entire film was shot ""in camera"" meaning nothing digital was added later and everything shot was handmade. There are about 200 characters, 200 sets, and approximately 2,000 props all made by hand. Elliot is a wealth of information about how all these elements come together to make such a complex, detailed film and is one of the more fascinating commentaries I've heard.",5,A clamation movie more for adults than kids,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,4190,"['Mary', 'Max', 'claymation', 'feature', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Adam', 'Elliot', 'was', 'Official', 'Selection', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'story', 'two', 'lives', 'change', 'forever', 'Mary', 'who', 'Melbourne', 'Australia', 'random', 'American', 'name', 'Manhatten', 'address', 'book', 'pen', 'pal', 'enters', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'Max', 'out', 'span', 'twenty', 'most', 'claymation', 'films', 'not', 'children', 'movie', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', 'course', 'film', 'characters', 'write', 'deal', 'alcoholism', 'kleptomania', 'religion', 'depression', 'agoraphobia', 'suicide.Lonely', 'eight-year-old', 'Mary', 'Daisy', 'Dinkle', 'voiced', 'Bethany', 'Whitmore', 'only', 'joy', 'watching', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', 'Noblets', 'consuming', 'sweetened', 'condensed', 'milk', 'mother', 'alcoholic', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'borrowing', 'items', 'store', 'stuffing', 'dress', 'father', 'hides', 'room', 'alone', 'day', 'drinking', 'Irish', 'Cream', 'birthmark', 'embarrassed', 'trouble', 'making', 'friends', 'day', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'how', 'life', 'America', 'different', 'life', 'Australia', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'would', 'select', 'someone', 'who', 'needed', 'friend', 'just', 'as', 'badly', 'did.Forty-four-year-old', 'Max', 'Jerry', 'Horovitz', 'voiced', 'Philip', 'Seymore', 'Hoffman', 'Overeaters', 'Anonymous', 'suffers', 'Asperger', 'syndrome', 'estranged', 'others', 'obsessed', 'problem', 'littering', 'strangeness', 'new', 'interaction', 'someone', 'letter', 'great', 'anxiety', 'due', 'condition', 'writing', 'come', 'shell', 'slowly', 'open', 'up', 'Mary', 'confessing', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'worries', 'other', 'move', 'closer', 'living', 'full-color', 'lives.At', 'times', 'relationship', 'estranged', 'due', 'Mary', 'growing', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'studying', 'psychology', 'learn', 'more', 'Max', 'When', 'Mary', 'up', 'voiced', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Damien', 'voiced', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'back', 'forth', 'friendship', 'trials', 'face', 'lives', 'are', 'saddening', 'sobering', 'deal', 'very', 'serious', 'issues', 'slightly', 'humorous', 'way', 'due', 'style', 'claymation', 'unique', 'film', 'family-fun', 'Pixar', 'Dreamworks', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'funny', 'letter-writing', 'story', 'very', 'sad', 'deals', 'really', 'serious', 'mental', 'psychological', 'problems', 'people', 'have', 'Wait', 'children', 'reach', 'mature', 'age', 'sharing', 'film', 'them.Bonus', 'Features', 'making', 'featurette', 'composed', 'series', 'odd', 'scenes', 'pieced', 'together', 'director', 'arriving', 'segway', 'riding', 'length', 'studio', 'one', 'person', 'destroying', 'miniature', 'set', 'big', 'mallot', 'short', 'interview', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'how', 'short', 'part', 'was', 'someone', 'receiving', 'ticket', 'cop', 'very', 'random', 'little', 'do', 'making', 'film', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'scale', 'Manhatten', 'set', 'close-ups', 'puppets', 'how', 'function', 'together', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'challenges', 'type', 'film.The', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'reveal', 'considerably', 'less', 'desirable', 'versions', 'two', 'closing', 'scenes', 'One', 'so', 'horrific', 'shocking', 'was', 'made', 'casting', 'call', 'showcasing', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'young', 'Mary', 'Bethanie', 'Whitmore', 'reading', 'audition', 'sides', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'short', 'film', 'also', 'written', 'directed', 'Adam', 'Elliot', '2003', 'called', 'Harvie', 'Krumpet', 'narrated', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'claymation', 'film', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'written', 'animated', 'humerous', 'way', 'detail', 'one', 'man', 'life', 'filled', 'challenges', 'hardships', 'inspired', 'Mary', 'Max', '.The', 'commentary', 'Adam', 'Elliot', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'camera', 'meaning', 'nothing', 'digital', 'was', 'added', 'later', 'everything', 'shot', 'was', 'handmade', 'are', '200', 'characters', '200', 'sets', 'approximately', '2,000', 'props', 'made', 'hand', 'Elliot', 'wealth', 'information', 'how', 'elements', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'such', 'complex', 'detailed', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'fascinating', 'commentaries', ""'ve"", 'heard']",Mary and Max
1327305,A1ZPPOOG5DCKT7,B00366E1E6,Ian Martin,"[0, 0]","Mary & Max took me completely by surprise. Given the aesthetic of the film and the comical tone, I was prepared for another quant little claymation film. The story revolves around two adorably sculpted characters that resemble Don Martin drawings: Mary Daisy Dinkle from Australia and Max Jerry Horowitz from New York.Mary, a child from Australia lives in a world dominated by browns. Her mother drinks, shop lifts, and accuses Mary of getting fat. Her father works in a factory and spends his spare time stuffing animals in the shed. Mary's parents provide her young mind with few answers to her questions about life so, in a moment of inspiration, she picks a name out of an American phone book and writes the name a letter.Her letter finds Max. Max lives in a one bedroom apartment in New York. Mary's brown letter is an invasion of color in Max's otherwise black and white life. He suffers from asperger syndrome (calling himself an aspy) and regularly has panic attacks when he receives letters from Mary. When Mary asks him about love it bring on an attack so serious he is briefly institutionalized and subjected to shock treatments. Mary and Max become dependent on each other through a series of gifts and funny letters.As the story progresses we start to sense a deep reservoir of feeling hiding behind the movies whimsical tone. Details about their family history that were so casually tossed out between jokes become deep scars that surgery can't remove (the way in one scene Mary removes her birthmark.) It's hard to say much more about the movie without giving away some of the surprise the movie brought me.This kind of immersion wouldn't have been possible if the details of the movie hadn't been so expertly assembled. Toni Collette and Phillip Seymour Hoffman provide Mary and Max's voice and are pitch perfect. Hoffman is particularly good as the lonely Horowitz and it wasn't until the end of the movie that I even realized that it was his voice. Mary's Australia and Max's New York are very well visualized as well. When Max walks into his building and climbs into the elevator I was reminded of the Coen Brother's hotel in Barton Fink.One of the differences between a good movie and great one is I will return to a great movie's characters in my mind days after I've watched the film. It's been a week now since I saw Mary and Max and I can honestly say that I've thought about it at some point each of the last seven days. Here is an animated movie that doesn't pander to any particular audience or age group. It doesn't dumb itself down. Instead it tells a story about two people that is whimsical, funny, lonely, sad, and intensely human.",5,Surprising and Stunning,1335744000,"04 30, 2012",2012,2663,"['Mary', 'Max', 'took', 'completely', 'surprise', 'Given', 'aesthetic', 'film', 'comical', 'tone', 'was', 'prepared', 'quant', 'little', 'claymation', 'film', 'story', 'around', 'two', 'adorably', 'sculpted', 'characters', 'resemble', 'Don', 'Martin', 'drawings', 'Mary', 'Daisy', 'Dinkle', 'Australia', 'Max', 'Jerry', 'Horowitz', 'New', 'York.Mary', 'child', 'Australia', 'world', 'dominated', 'browns', 'mother', 'drinks', 'shop', 'lifts', 'Mary', 'getting', 'fat', 'father', 'factory', 'spare', 'time', 'stuffing', 'animals', 'shed', 'Mary', 'parents', 'provide', 'young', 'mind', 'few', 'answers', 'questions', 'life', 'so', 'moment', 'inspiration', 'name', 'American', 'phone', 'book', 'name', 'letter.Her', 'letter', 'Max', 'Max', 'one', 'bedroom', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'Mary', 'brown', 'letter', 'invasion', 'color', 'Max', 'otherwise', 'black', 'white', 'life', 'asperger', 'syndrome', 'calling', 'aspy', 'regularly', 'panic', 'attacks', 'when', 'letters', 'Mary', 'When', 'Mary', 'love', 'bring', 'attack', 'so', 'serious', 'briefly', 'institutionalized', 'subjected', 'shock', 'treatments', 'Mary', 'Max', 'become', 'dependent', 'other', 'series', 'gifts', 'funny', 'letters.As', 'story', 'start', 'sense', 'deep', 'reservoir', 'feeling', 'hiding', 'movies', 'whimsical', 'tone', 'Details', 'family', 'history', 'were', 'so', 'casually', 'tossed', 'out', 'jokes', 'become', 'deep', 'scars', 'surgery', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remove', 'way', 'one', 'scene', 'Mary', 'birthmark', 'hard', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'giving', 'away', 'surprise', 'movie', 'brought', 'me.This', 'kind', 'immersion', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'details', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'so', 'expertly', 'assembled', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'provide', 'Mary', 'Max', 'voice', 'are', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Hoffman', 'particularly', 'good', 'lonely', 'Horowitz', 'was', ""n't"", 'end', 'movie', 'even', 'realized', 'was', 'voice', 'Mary', 'Australia', 'Max', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'visualized', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'Max', 'building', 'climbs', 'elevator', 'was', 'reminded', 'Coen', 'Brother', 'hotel', 'Barton', 'Fink.One', 'differences', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'one', 'will', 'return', 'great', 'movie', 'characters', 'mind', 'days', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', 'been', 'week', 'now', 'saw', 'Mary', 'Max', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'point', 'last', 'seven', 'days', 'Here', 'animated', 'movie', ""n't"", 'pander', 'particular', 'audience', 'age', 'group', ""n't"", 'dumb', 'down', 'Instead', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'whimsical', 'funny', 'lonely', 'sad', 'intensely', 'human']",Mary and Max

I finally sat down and gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. The animation is excellent in it's dreary and ugliness, which is important as the story trundles along. It's a slow, deliberate plot and it develops the two protagonists mostly through corresponding letters. The story is deep, and embraces the absurd and the almost disturbing behaviors that many of us have. It is not based on a true story, as the beginning would have you believe ( the director admitted that he got the idea from a normal relationship with a pen-pal he had as a child) but quite honestly, it doesn't make a difference to me.

1327307,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B00366E1E6,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[2, 2]","Technology is constantly fluctuating. Even other day you can get a new phone thatfll do at least one more thing than the last one: voice dialing, HD video recording, bar-code reading, GPS,  video chat, until eventually our phones will inhabit our bodies and force us into slavery. Wait, has Apple already done that?Another bit of technology that is constantly in flux is film. One day we have jerky, black-and-white, soundless frames available in 5x5 manually rotating film boxes, the next we have computer generated imagery of a cartoon wildebeest sharing a screen with the since deceased Rodney Dangerfield running us down in 3-D. Itfs been quite a century.In the midst of that timeline of film, there once was an stop-motion animated process called claymation. The use of claymation began before cell-structuring, and could be seen used in creations such as Bob the Builder, every worthwhile Christmas special ever made, TOOL videos, and uber-ridiculous video games. In keeping with the idea that art should be a pain-staking, bloody process that would take years to accomplish, claymation film made itself a true 3-D art form to be pitted against a more commercial, computer-generated 3-D world. Sadly, stop-motion in general lost steam as Tim Burton decided to put Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in as many live-action movies as possible. however, there was a minor resurgence in the art-form when Seth Green launched his infamous Robot Chicken. It is unknown how much an effect Robot Chicken had on writer/director Henry Selick, but some time later Coraline hit the public with tremendous success. Stop-motion animation was shot in 3-D, blending the old with the new with fantastic success.However, I havenft given a crap about the return of claymation for at least a decade, until I saw Mary & Max.The story that evolves in Mary & Max is almost like an adult fairytale, except that it is based in reality, and is supposedly even based on a true story. Itfs not exactly the content that makes it like a fairytale, but more how it is presented. For most of the film, the story is explained to us by a disembodied narrator(voiced by Barry Humphries) as if our grandfather were telling us about Mary & Max, after he had told us that babies came from beer glasses. This narration gives the story a quirky cuteness to it, since many times the action on the screen is almost the opposite of what the narrator is portraying, like how a child, or a middle-aged man with Aspergerfs Syndrome, would imagine it.The plot of Mary & Max is as follows: a lonely, chubby 8 year old Australian with a Gorbachev birthmark named Mary Daisy Dinkle randomly chooses an address from New York to start writing to in the hopes that they would answer a question about where babies come from in America. The letter is received by Max Jerry Horowitz(played by Philip Seymour Hoffman), an obese, 44 year old Jewish atheist living in New York with Aspergerfs Syndrome. Maryfs simple letter is answered with a novel of a letter where Max divulges information I wouldnft put in a diary that I locked away in a safety deposit box on the moon. He also tells her that in America, babies come from eggs laid by rabbis, Catholic nuns, and dirty prostitutes. This begins an inter-continental friendship that lasts for about 18 years, that is followed throughout the movie.The comedy comes from the sincerity of Mary and Max as they try to explain their lives to each other in their socially inept voices: Mary being inexperienced with life, and Max being utterly oblivious at times. A little girlfs obsession with Earl Grey, a manfs obsession with chocolate hotdogs, a closeted Greek boy with an obsession with sheep herders(played by Eric Bana), even suicide, these ideas are all incorporated into almost a sing-song quality. This does not diminish the emotions involved to the viewer when watching the film, but it does dull the sharpness a bit. The story isnft without grieving moments, which makes it more like the adult fairytale description that I just canft shake from. Oh, and I got a little misty-eyed at the end. Like when I watched What Dreams May Come and Big Fish. Wimp, you say? I dare you to get through any of these 3 movies without some tears, you cold-hearted [...].The production of the film is fantastic. During the opening credits, the camera work makes it a point to show the detail and texture that had gone into creating the settings and characters, from lamp posts to pets. They look almost animated, which is a testament to not only the clay artisans, but the cinematography as well. The detail is what makes this movie stand out most of all, and reclaim the idea of claymation as an art-form, and not some ridiculously low-budget production style.In regards to flaws, I couldnft find any. The only thing I could call a flaw is that the packaging as an animated movie, and the gNot Ratedh rating, could result in an oblivious parent picking out the movie for their child. There are few moments that could be construed as explicit, but as a whole, the movie is a little too deep and the subject matter a bit more adult orientated. This is from a guy who turned his younger siblings on to horror movies.I give this film 5 out of 5 chocolate hotdogs.

Everything about it was excellent, except the film itself. The acting was splendid--I'm not sure I've ever felt an actor dissolve into an animated creature as well as happened here. The sets were incredible; Central Park was just stupendous. The two-tone photography was a brilliant touch. Yep, many, many special things.But I disliked it a lot. I could write about many of the reasons, but the film's animosity (and it is clearly animosity) toward the handicapped and toward religion are despicable. I am quite aware we were supposed to see the ""retard"" headlines as manifestations of the world's ignorance and malice, but I cannot help but feel that there is a definite level of condescension toward Max in the film as well. He is designed to be laughed at; his foibles and peculiarities are all-too-real, but also the butt of many jokes. Max is a confused and helpless guy, incapable of handling the many challenges that come from a lonely life in a big city, and much of the humor is of the ""fish out of water"" variety. But I felt quite sorry for him. It is certainly funny when Charlie Chaplin slips on a banana peel, but far less so if a blind man on crutches takes the same fall. That's not comic. That's cruel.I'm not sure how strong a case you're making against religion by having someone as disoriented and generally baffled as Max as your spokesman, but the lines about the foolishness and childishness of religion were pointless, unnecessary, and diminished the tale. I know it is de rigueur for every film to take a swipe at God, no matter how inappropriate it is, but I was just irritated by this. Added nothing, took away a lot. God, on the other hand, can handle this petty snideness just fine. In fact, the theme of this film, that forgiveness has to be humbly offered, and accepted with equal humility, because fallible creatures will inevitably wound each other, is one I've read about in a religious text or two. Powerful stuff, that.And, the gratuitous and cheesy sex jokes and naked bodies were not just unfunny, they were creepy. I guess this was to appeal to ""grown-ups"", but they certainly did not appeal to me. Maybe I'm just not grown up enough......So it got all the peripherals right, but missed mightily on the big things. And created a movie whose audience I have a hard time imagining. Not kids, that's for sure. Not me or my world. I guess it is for smarmy, smart-mouthed, self-indulgent and self-absorbed young people who know better than everyone else the pointlessness of contemporary life, the idiocy of religious belief, and the hollowness of most family relationships. If that's you, well enjoy, at least as much as you can enjoy anything!

1327315,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B00366E1E6,judy,"[0, 0]","What a weird movie. Not in premise, but just in the characters and the way it's set up. Black and White and Chocolate Hotdogs and such. So peculiar, so strange, so inventive. My father watched this movie with me, his words after watching it &#34;Weird.&#34; It is, I had my head turning after the first line came out. 'Mary and Max' is a film that shouldn't be viewed by children; it deals with a load of mature subjects and is completely inappropriate for children. I just thought I might as well say that before starting my review. Onto my review of the weird 'Mary and Max'.'Mary and Max' tells the tale of a young girl, Mary (Voiced by Bethany Whitmore) a lonely girl, who befriends a man named Max (Voiced by Phillip Seymour Hoffman) via penpaling. They bond, and learn more and more about each other through the years.I donno how else to explain the film. It's a film you need to watch to get the plot in full form.Something I enjoyed a lot about the film was the switch between color (Mary's side) and black and white (Max's side). Visually, it's interesting. The tone, you'll notice switches as the color switches. From light (Mary's side) to dark and gloomy (Max's side). I liked that idea, because it better sets the mood, and feeling you'd be going through as well as the characters emotions. And that one slice of color on Max's head is something to look at. A single star on a bleak skyThe animation is spectacular really. The tiny bits of detail in the characters s there, and their worlds look completely real. The animation has dull shades of color, but it sets the mood, and works overall. Its clay-mation that you know has been worked on for a long while. It's sharp, inventive, and show's craftsmanship and hard work.The character designs are sharp to the tip. Max is expesically interesting in form. His fat, pardon, is well detailed, as well as his facial expressions, which run out quit well.'Mary and Max' is never really engaging; it just plays at the same speed, and bores along. It's not very original, but has surprises that I had not thought of, but never really make you tense up. The film tends to become dull at moments, it's never exciting. Or thrilling, or full of life. It's just plain old dull. Colors, and story, and dialogue. It's all dull to the point of depression. The film loses you midway through after picking you up, because you get bored with the same picture of a bleak, bleak world for those two leads. You wish it became light and fun but it doesn't, even the jokes, which do make you laugh come out as creepy and sad.The dialogue is of its own, good. Some of the dialogue is witty; other snippet's sad and depressing. It's all good and doesn't come out corny or cheesy or however you want to put it, the dialogue, which runs the whole movie, is pretty sharp.In particular I found the character development to be very solid. You learn more about the characters then you'd thought you'd have, and by the end you know about everything the character thinks or does, and how they act and why they act that way, you understand their opinions and emotions. That was solid work, and in the end you do become emotionally attached to the characters in some weird form.The problem is the plot. It's just not enough to keep you tuned in. The plot, is just so thin and unoriginal, you are not kept interested from it. The film sports interesting ideas, but overall it's squandered by the way to easy main plot.All and All, 'Mary and Max' is a very weird film, with beautiful animation, and solid character development but squandered by the overpowering dark and gloomy tone, and thin plot stretched its limits. C+ 3/7/14P.S: The film may not be for the mainstream film audience, but it will delight the more art-house filmgoers. So, I separately rate the film a 4 Stars rating.

Mary's mother's favorite things in life are her ciggys, shoplifting, sherry and telling her daughter that she was a mistake. Her father has the most comically dull job on Earth and spends his free time, not with Mary but in a backyard shed drinking Bailey's Irish Cream and stuffing road kill.Through all this Mary still tries to smile and seeks answers to questions that all children have that she can't get answered. In her desire for a friend she picks at random a listing from a New York phone book and decides to write to this stranger hoping to have a pen pal.She chooses Max Jerry Horowitz, mid forties Jewish atheist, who contends with Asperger Syndrome.  Max, who also has no friends is taken aback by this but writes back to Mary starting a 22 year relationship.The film is very funny, very dark but shows how these two cope with life, each other and a world that neither can really grasp. Mary's enthusiasm is a pure delight to watch and despite suffering with mental illness, Max is very very wise in his observations and insights.This is NOT a film for children in any way shape or form, so parents PLEASE screen this then make up your minds of how suitable it is for younger viewers.

The seriousness of its topics like death, sex, suicide and mental illness definitely requires a more mature audience. But, trust me, as serious as it sounds, you don't wanna miss it! It's a simple story with a BIG message about the value and beauty of oddness and unconventional friendship. You don't quite know if you're watching a tragedy or a comedy and perhaps it's a mix of both. But ultimately, it doesn't matter. The point is to feel something and you feel a lot of everything when you're watching the life-long journey of these mismatched friends. The characters, Mary and Max, are like the Odd Couple meets Sigmund Freud.Mary and Max is touching, poignant and funny in a very raw and immature sort of way. But what makes this little gem so fantastic is the juxtaposition of the artsy sophistication when contrasted against the emotional crudeness. For starters, the animation is impressive. The whole movie is desaturated, lacking vibrancy that cleverly mimics the vulnerability in both Mary and Max's lives. I'd venture to say that the animation rivals that of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas or, dare I say it, a Pixar flick.I know! But seriously, it's an art form, one that Elliott's got down. It's pretty incredible.Quirky, charming and eclectic. Those are just a few of the words I'd use to describe this film.

I promise, you won't regret it.Food for Thought: Mary and Max is not your average cartoon.

In fact, it is one of the best films I have seen in any year; as of this writing, it is currently sitting at #16 on my 1000 Best list. (The next film down the list I first viewed in 2013 is Berberian Sound Studio, which sits at #32.) It is a profoundly affecting, perfectly-related story with near endless heart. While I know there are people out there who fit the description, I simply can't imagine anyone not loving this. And to top it all off&#8212;it's claymation.Plot: Mary (voice of Blackwood's Bethany Whitmore) is a lonely Australian girl who decides she needs a pen pal. She goes to the library, piecks out a phone book at random, and then stabs her finger down on a name, copies the address, and writes a letter. In this way, she introduces herself to Max (voice of Love Liza's Philip Seymour Hoffman), a forty-four-year-old shut-in from New York City. Max is, at first, hesitant, but, with a few interruptions, thus begins a twenty-year correspondence between the two, and they&#8212;both with mental issues (Mary is depressed, Max has a disorder the revelation of which is one of the movie's big twists&#8212;though many who have friends who suffer the same disorder will be able to pinpoint it long before Max does)&#8212;find their best friends in each other.While this is not, ostensibly, a romance (though there is an undercurrent of that throughout), I can't imagine a purveyor of same, be they novelist, scriptwriter, director, poet, whatever, who would not be able to draw endlessly on Mary and Max for inspiration and advice; this is a textbook on how to build flawed, relatable characters that audiences can easily identify with. The deepening friendship between the two, as well, is pitch-perfect as regards its pacing and the changing emotions between the two. Nothing about this feels staged or artificial, and while I know I have mentioned this already in the review, it bears repeating: the painstaking attention to building realistic characters and situations is underlined, triple and bold, in red, by this being claymation rather than live action. No wild flights of fantasy here; Elliot gives us a simple story, simply told, and he does it with such phenomenal empathy that it is impossible, at least I find it so, not to be as affected by this as anything else I have ever seen.

Mary and Max stands out in the league for just being uniquely different in its own right mostly for trying to take an original concept, having rather mature and daring elements like depression, loneliness, and alcoholism, and execute its offbeat rhythm to the beat of a comical drama in the form of letters-by-letters and narration for the whole film. Rarely does this occur in my film experience and given the unique story patterns and thematic edge, that is what makes the film surprisingly stand out even only seen it in two parts. Max Horowitz, excellently voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman, stands out a bit more given his wide array of issues/problems that he suffered and Max has a very Harvie Krumpet way about his behaviour that is perceivable in the appearance and crudity. The film does suffer from some thematic devices by skimming the surface and slightly rushing toward a good but abrupt ending. Life happens in flashes and at random but some focus toward a more solid conclusion could've worked and Mary's scenes of depression have a very disturbing nature about them that makes the film otherwise inappropriate for younger children as well as the suggestive humour and dark mature themes. The film is best recommended in the eyes of those who love animation as they'll have the opportunity to see a world in which is not entirely involved in mecha, talking animals, creepy crawlers, or franchises but something as human and dear to the complex soul as this little gem.""CONTENT ADVISORY: While unrated, the film contains mature themes, disturbing situations, and suggestive humour that parents may find inappropriate for younger audiences.

The story is brilliant in its simplicity (Mary picks a random name out of the US phone book, and it happens to be Max Horrowitz), and shines as we are shown more of Max's history, personality and eccentricities (apparently, being a member of a science fiction club wasn't enough to convince army recruiters to consider Max 'insane' enough to stay out of military service).Phillip Seymour Hoffman shines as a middle-aged Jewish man with Asperger's. A very quiet man, he only speaks twice (in Yiddish). He is able to express himself very eloquently with nothing more than his typewriter (although he frequently suffers from a minuscule attention span).Mary lives with her mother Vera (a kleptomaniac shoplifter), and a father who has one of the most boring jobs in the world (attaching strings to teabags... in a FACTORY!). Her neighbours include the school bully and the stuttering Damien. While the bully (quite likely a future criminal) is very simple and shallow, Damien and the Vietnam veteran turned amputee-agoraphobe certainly aren't.The extras include a brief audition from Young Mary, and a director's commentary track (well worth listening to, and tons of fun).

Mary and Max may share many elements with movies of this ilk - including poop jokes, pratfalls, and occasional childlike innocence - but it shares much more of a relation with the gloomy dramedies that have become popular in the last half-decade. Not that writer/director Adam Elliot - whose short film Harvie Krumpet won him an Oscar in 2004 - could be considered derivative. In fact, Mary and Max (and Harvie Krumpet - included as a special feature on this dvd) showcases Elliot's singular vision of childlike wonder clashing with the harsh realities of adulthood.Through the course of the movie, we follow a young Australian girl (Mary - eventually voiced by Toni Collette, once she ages) as she sends and receives letters, postcards, and packages from the titular Max (expertly voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman), a depressed Jewish overeater with Asberger's Syndrome. The two characters, living as outcasts from the societies around them, manage to connect over the years as they discuss alcoholism, religion, and where babies come from. As the story progresses and Mary ages, she eventually marries and goes off to college, where she seeks a ""cure"" for Max's disorder. The relationship between Mary and Max is alternately commonplace and sublime as the two very different individuals react to the beliefs, troubles, and joys of each other's lives.With striking visuals (there's also a nice ""Making Of"" and a ""Behind The Scenes"" featurette included on the dvd) and a moving story full of pathos, Mary and Max is a beautifully presented film that manages to touch on universal themes through the seemingly confined lens of a few odd characters. Though I have to admit that the ending is a bit disappointing, everything leading up to it is impeccable.",4,Charming and endearing while simultaneously disturbing,1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,1991,"['cover', 'film', 'clearly', 'clever', 'mixture', 'humorous', 'quirkiness', 'bleak', 'melancholy', 'may', 'still', 'mistake', 'presentation', 'claymation', 'characters', 'pertaining', 'what', 'generally', 'considered', 'kid', 'movie', 'Mary', 'Max', 'may', 'share', 'many', 'elements', 'movies', 'ilk', 'including', 'poop', 'jokes', 'pratfalls', 'occasional', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'shares', 'much', 'more', 'relation', 'gloomy', 'dramedies', 'have', 'become', 'popular', 'last', 'half-decade', 'Not', 'writer/director', 'Adam', 'Elliot', 'short', 'film', 'Harvie', 'Krumpet', 'won', 'Oscar', '2004', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'derivative', 'fact', 'Mary', 'Max', 'Harvie', 'Krumpet', 'included', 'special', 'feature', 'dvd', 'Elliot', 'singular', 'vision', 'childlike', 'wonder', 'clashing', 'harsh', 'realities', 'course', 'movie', 'follow', 'young', 'Australian', 'girl', 'Mary', 'eventually', 'voiced', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'once', 'letters', 'postcards', 'packages', 'titular', 'Max', 'expertly', 'voiced', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'depressed', 'Jewish', 'overeater', 'Asberger', 'Syndrome', 'two', 'characters', 'living', 'outcasts', 'societies', 'manage', 'connect', 'years', 'discuss', 'alcoholism', 'religion', 'where', 'babies', 'come', 'story', 'progresses', 'Mary', 'ages', 'eventually', 'marries', 'off', 'college', 'where', 'cure', 'Max', 'disorder', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'Max', 'alternately', 'commonplace', 'sublime', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'individuals', 'react', 'beliefs', 'troubles', 'joys', 'other', 'lives.With', 'striking', 'visuals', 'also', 'nice', 'Making', 'Scenes', 'featurette', 'included', 'dvd', 'moving', 'story', 'full', 'pathos', 'Mary', 'Max', 'beautifully', 'presented', 'film', 'touch', 'universal', 'themes', 'seemingly', 'confined', 'lens', 'few', 'odd', 'characters', 'have', 'admit', 'ending', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'everything', 'leading', 'up', 'impeccable']",Mary and Max
