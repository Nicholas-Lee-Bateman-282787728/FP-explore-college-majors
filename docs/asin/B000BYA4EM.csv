Everyday, he gives me the dvd to put on & watches it over & over & over. It's great for infants & toddlers because it's all music & the characters are cute little babies. My son loves music & loves to dance so it keeps him glued to the tv. He can't get enough of it! It tells several short musical ""stories"" about Baby Elmo, Cookie Monster, Big Bird & Prairie Dawn. In each story, it shows real babies & their mommies dancing too. This is a great video & a nice change from the traditional Sesame Street videos.",5,My 18 month old's favorite video!,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,600,"['son', 'been', 'watching', 'video', 'several', 'months', 'still', 'favorite', 'video', 'Everyday', 'dvd', 'put', 'watches', 'great', 'infants', 'toddlers', 'music', 'characters', 'are', 'cute', 'little', 'babies', 'son', 'music', 'dance', 'glued', 'tv', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'several', 'short', 'musical', 'stories', 'Baby', 'Elmo', 'Cookie', 'Monster', 'Big', 'Bird', 'Prairie', 'Dawn', 'story', 'real', 'babies', 'mommies', 'dancing', 'too', 'great', 'video', 'nice', 'change', 'traditional', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'videos']",Sesame Beginning:Make Music Together DVD

My 13 month old loves bopping along, and has started to immitate words from the songs. There's lots of repitition and the theme of each segment is consistent across scenes, which means that its unified and cohesive (as opposed to most Baby Einstein DVDS). As usual, the show combines moms, dads and other relatives with all sorts of colors and backgrounds. Plus you will LOVE the songs!",5,Love it!,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,499,"['just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'Children', 'Television', 'Workshop', 'creating', 'wonderful', 'developmentally', 'appropriate', 'products', '13', 'month', 'old', 'bopping', 'along', 'started', 'immitate', 'words', 'songs', 'lots', 'repitition', 'theme', 'segment', 'consistent', 'scenes', 'unified', 'cohesive', 'opposed', 'most', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'DVDS', 'usual', 'show', 'moms', 'dads', 'other', 'relatives', 'sorts', 'colors', 'backgrounds', 'will', 'LOVE', 'songs']",Sesame Beginning:Make Music Together DVD

When I was a kid I was totally crazy about the Sesame Street gang.  Anyway, this is a really fun DVD to watch, esp. when you're cooking or just plain bored with life.  The music is upbeat and it really makes you feel good about life.  And the baby muppets are so cute!  I think, with the adults' approval, I'll get this and other Sesame Beginnings titles as baby shower gifts in the future.",4,Fun for adults,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,627,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'own', 'when', 'heard', 'controversy', 'Sesame', 'Beginnings', 'know', 'how', 'doctors', 'believe', 'kids', '2', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'exposed', 'TV', 'wandered', 'local', 'store', 'picked', 'up', 'copy', 'title', 'When', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'totally', 'crazy', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'gang', 'Anyway', 'really', 'fun', 'DVD', 'watch', 'esp', 'when', ""'re"", 'cooking', 'just', 'plain', 'bored', 'life', 'music', 'upbeat', 'really', 'feel', 'good', 'life', 'baby', 'muppets', 'are', 'so', 'cute', 'think', 'adults', 'approval', ""'ll"", 'get', 'other', 'Sesame', 'Beginnings', 'titles', 'baby', 'shower', 'gifts', 'future']",Sesame Beginning:Make Music Together DVD

I like the emphasis on singing and etc. and I find it pretty cute too. Basically I like the Elmo and Cookie Monster characters but find the sections with Prairie Dawn and her mom annoying. My kid doesn't seem to notice though and really seems to enjoy this dvd.,5,my baby loves this,1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,353,"['baby', 'only', '3', 'months', 'old', 'especially', 'sections', 'Elmo', 'emphasis', 'singing', 'etc', 'find', 'pretty', 'cute', 'too', 'Basically', 'like', 'Elmo', 'Cookie', 'Monster', 'characters', 'find', 'sections', 'Prairie', 'Dawn', 'mom', 'annoying', 'kid', ""n't"", 'seem', 'notice', 'really', 'enjoy', 'dvd']",Sesame Beginning:Make Music Together DVD

Features the sesame street characters as babies and has many cute and catchy songs...You won't regret buying this one!
