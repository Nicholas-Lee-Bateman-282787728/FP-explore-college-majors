Here in the USA, ""Babylon"" is the song that got the most exposure.  I had heard the song, and it piqued my interest as to who was behind the mike.The audio of this DVD is great!  My only criticism of the visual side of it is the occasional use of grainy computer cameras mounted on the mike stand and above the drummer and also on the bass guitar.  Thankfully, the editor didn't dwell on these shots, as they are of very low-grade and somewhat distracting.",5,DVD Concert Fans take note:  David Gray Rocks!,1024012800,"06 14, 2002",2002,619,"['am', 'always', 'looking', 'good', 'concert', 'DVD', 'buy', 'one', 'been', 'added', 'list.David', 'Gray', 'honest', 'powerful', 'voice', 'attention', 'Here', 'USA', 'Babylon', 'song', 'got', 'most', 'exposure', 'had', 'heard', 'song', 'piqued', 'interest', 'who', 'was', 'mike.The', 'audio', 'DVD', 'great', 'only', 'criticism', 'visual', 'side', 'occasional', 'use', 'grainy', 'computer', 'cameras', 'mounted', 'mike', 'stand', 'drummer', 'also', 'bass', 'guitar', 'Thankfully', 'editor', 'did', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'shots', 'are', 'very', 'low-grade', 'somewhat', 'distracting']",David Gray - Live at the Point

I love the presentation--nothing over the top, just about the music!  Gray's genuineness and sentimentality translate well in concert.  This DVD makes me anxious for the time I'm able to see him in concert here in the United States!  As is the case with many truly gifted artists, Gray is not as well known as he should be.  I suppose if the majority of people in this world like what you're doing, you're probably not doing something right.

681142,AG86A2LSD8X20,B00005S80Y,tom carrigan,"[1, 1]","I have to be honest that I did not follow David Gray until White Ladder came out. Once I listened to this I realized what a great song writer he was and went back to appreciate his previous music. The DVD Live at the Point is not flashy but most of his fans are not followers for great stage shows, they want David seen and singing from his passion for his songwriting. I have not seen him personally in concert but his head movement does bug me ...As far as the concert itself and deliver and reproduction you cannot go wrong.. I put david in the class of Edwin McCain but not yet the claiber of Don Henly who I consider one of the best song writers and delivery of his lyrics better than anyone, John Mayer is not far behind John and David and the interesting thing is they have been around awhile and just coming into ther own fame. Its grate to see and this DVD will notdissapoint you",5,david at his best,1048032000,"03 19, 2003",2003,888,"['have', 'be', 'honest', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'David', 'Gray', 'White', 'Ladder', 'came', 'out', 'Once', 'listened', 'realized', 'what', 'great', 'song', 'writer', 'was', 'went', 'back', 'appreciate', 'previous', 'music', 'DVD', 'Live', 'Point', 'not', 'flashy', 'most', 'fans', 'are', 'not', 'followers', 'great', 'stage', 'shows', 'want', 'David', 'seen', 'singing', 'passion', 'songwriting', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'personally', 'concert', 'head', 'movement', 'bug', 'As', 'far', 'concert', 'deliver', 'reproduction', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong..', 'put', 'david', 'class', 'Edwin', 'McCain', 'not', 'yet', 'claiber', 'Don', 'Henly', 'who', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'song', 'writers', 'delivery', 'lyrics', 'better', 'anyone', 'John', 'Mayer', 'not', 'far', 'John', 'David', 'interesting', 'thing', 'have', 'been', 'awhile', 'just', 'coming', 'ther', 'own', 'fame', 'grate', 'see', 'DVD', 'will', 'notdissapoint']",David Gray - Live at the Point
681143,A3EKK7FDAZECS9,B00005S80Y,T. Quach,"[9, 9]","I have the region 2 version of this DVD, which I bought off Amazon.co.uk -- this concert is absolutely amazing.  It's hard to describe, but the crowd of about 9,000 people seems incredibly intimate for such a large group of people...in a way, it matches David's own transformation from being kind of a folksy singer-songwriter to being part of the British and American musical mainstream.  This concert has the personal feel of a &quot;house&quot; show while at the same time capturing David's growing popularity with the masses.  I loved every minute of it.  All his best songs are here.  He performs a ton of songs from the White Ladder cd (the title track, sail away, please forgive me, this year's love, say hello, wave good-bye and, of course, babylon are only a few of the songs you'll get to hear from that cd).  In addition, David also performs key tracks from each of his previous three albums (&quot;shine&quot; stands out in my mind as the not-to-be-missed song of those albums and, of course, that's included here as well).  In total, the concert is well over an hour, and David performs 17 or 18 songs.  There's not a whole lot of theatrics going on, so don't be expecting him to put on any kind of act or to get excessive with the storytelling.  Of course, if you're a David Gray fan, you should already know that it's all about the music.  If you are not already a David Gray fan, however, and are just looking to try something &quot;new,&quot; be forewarned:  this is not a concert that uses gimmicks or props.  But then again, this is not a concert that needs those things to keep you interested.  This concert, like David Gray himself, is all about the music.  And what great music it is!  In addition to the concert, the dvd also contains an interesting documentary on David Gray, the man behind the music.  A definite must-have for any David Gray fan, and a worthy investment for anyone who just appreciates deep, soulful music.  Highly, highly recommended.",5,"If you like David Gray, you'll love this DVD!",1006905600,"11 28, 2001",2001,1977,"['have', 'region', '2', 'version', 'DVD', 'bought', 'off', 'Amazon.co.uk', 'concert', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'hard', 'describe', 'crowd', '9,000', 'people', 'incredibly', 'intimate', 'large', 'group', 'people', 'way', 'David', 'own', 'transformation', 'being', 'kind', 'folksy', 'singer-songwriter', 'being', 'part', 'British', 'American', 'musical', 'mainstream', 'concert', 'personal', 'feel', 'quot', 'house', 'quot', 'show', 'same', 'time', 'capturing', 'David', 'growing', 'popularity', 'masses', 'loved', 'minute', 'best', 'songs', 'are', 'here', 'ton', 'songs', 'White', 'Ladder', 'cd', 'title', 'track', 'sail', 'away', 'please', 'forgive', 'year', 'love', 'say', 'hello', 'wave', 'good-bye', 'course', 'babylon', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'songs', ""'ll"", 'get', 'hear', 'cd', 'addition', 'David', 'also', 'key', 'tracks', 'previous', 'three', 'albums', 'quot', 'shine', 'quot', 'out', 'mind', 'not-to-be-missed', 'song', 'albums', 'course', 'included', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'total', 'concert', 'well', 'hour', 'David', '17', '18', 'songs', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'theatrics', 'going', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'expecting', 'put', 'kind', 'act', 'get', 'excessive', 'storytelling', 'course', ""'re"", 'David', 'Gray', 'fan', 'should', 'already', 'know', 'music', 'are', 'not', 'already', 'David', 'Gray', 'fan', 'however', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'try', 'something', 'quot', 'new', 'quot', 'be', 'forewarned', 'not', 'concert', 'gimmicks', 'props', 'then', 'again', 'not', 'concert', 'things', 'keep', 'interested', 'concert', 'David', 'Gray', 'music', 'what', 'great', 'music', 'addition', 'concert', 'dvd', 'also', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'David', 'Gray', 'man', 'music', 'definite', 'must-have', 'David', 'Gray', 'fan', 'worthy', 'investment', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'deep', 'soulful', 'music', 'Highly', 'highly', 'recommended']",David Gray - Live at the Point
