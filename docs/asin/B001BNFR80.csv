1172785,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B001BNFR80,&#308;&#308;,"[1, 1]","""Dancing with the Stars: Latin Cardio Dance"" was the DWTS franchise's second attempt at a workout, and to be quite honest, it wasn't much better than the first one.  It's focused more at beginners with simplistic steps and minimal arm movement; also, the instructors aren't the best teachers for a workout video.  Maks is better than in the first video since he seems more friendly, but he still could seem more energetic.  Cheryl is just bad as her cuing is horrible, and she appears to be very fake.  However, the dances are still fun to, and here is a breakdown of each:Warm Up - First, you start off with a short, 3-4 minute warm up that Cheryl teaches.  It consists of very basic stretches, and most people should be able to follow.Merengue - Led by Cheryl, this is definitely one of the easiest, low impact routines on the DVD.  It starts off EXTREMELY slowly teaching you the basic Merengue step (kind of a mixture of a march and a swivel) half time, then it gradually builds up to showing that basic move fast.  Eventually, Cheryl introduces some steps that move a bit differently in the merengue, but everything is taught slowly, and this dance is very low impact and beginner friendly.Cha-Cha - This also starts out very basic, with Maksim, who is the instructor of this dance, teaching the basic cha-cha rhythm.  Then you move that rhythm forward, to the side, back, etc.  The second half gets a bit more complex as Maks introduces syncopated timing, which is quite fast.  It is taught very slowly at first, however, before being taken up to full timing, but this makes the dance best for Intermediates.Samba - Cheryl leads again with this dance which is not only the most complex but also the highest impact of all the dance routines.  This routine has the worst cuing, as Cheryl just calls out ""Now!"" before the step is done, and almost none of the moves are broken down.  However, I, as a rather advanced exerciser/dancer, loved this segment the most with its somewhat complex steps that really got my heart rate up.Mambo - As Maks leads this routine, the difficulty goes WAY down again to the level of the Merengue.  This dance very much resembles the cha-cha, only without the cha-cha-cha rhythm.  It is very easy, but its movements are big which kept my heart rate up from the Samba.Toning - Now this was my favorite part of the entire DVD!  It mixed toning with stretching to create a feel-good strengthening workout.  Cheryl and Maks co-teach this routine starting out with some squats and lunges at the beginning.  Next come some more balletic toning exercises with very balletic arms.  Then more leg toning with more lunches, and finally, the toning section is finished with push-ups and more stretches.Overall, this is an OK Latin dance workout that Beginners and low Intermediates will really enjoy.  More advanced exercisers might want to skip this DVD, though, unless they are huge fans of the show.",3,A low impact Latin dance workout,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,2924,"['Dancing', 'Stars', 'Latin', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'was', 'DWTS', 'franchise', 'second', 'attempt', 'workout', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'focused', 'more', 'beginners', 'simplistic', 'steps', 'minimal', 'arm', 'movement', 'also', 'instructors', 'are', ""n't"", 'best', 'teachers', 'workout', 'video', 'Maks', 'better', 'first', 'video', 'more', 'friendly', 'still', 'could', 'seem', 'more', 'energetic', 'Cheryl', 'just', 'bad', 'cuing', 'horrible', 'be', 'very', 'fake', 'However', 'dances', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'here', 'breakdown', 'Warm', 'Up', 'First', 'start', 'short', '3-4', 'minute', 'warm', 'up', 'Cheryl', 'teaches', 'very', 'basic', 'stretches', 'most', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'follow.Merengue', 'Led', 'Cheryl', 'definitely', 'one', 'easiest', 'low', 'impact', 'routines', 'DVD', 'EXTREMELY', 'slowly', 'teaching', 'basic', 'Merengue', 'step', 'kind', 'mixture', 'march', 'swivel', 'half', 'time', 'then', 'gradually', 'up', 'showing', 'basic', 'move', 'fast', 'Eventually', 'Cheryl', 'steps', 'move', 'bit', 'differently', 'merengue', 'everything', 'taught', 'slowly', 'dance', 'very', 'low', 'impact', 'beginner', 'friendly.Cha-Cha', 'also', 'out', 'very', 'basic', 'Maksim', 'who', 'instructor', 'dance', 'teaching', 'basic', 'cha-cha', 'rhythm', 'Then', 'move', 'rhythm', 'forward', 'side', 'back', 'etc', 'second', 'half', 'bit', 'more', 'complex', 'Maks', 'introduces', 'syncopated', 'timing', 'quite', 'fast', 'taught', 'very', 'slowly', 'first', 'however', 'being', 'taken', 'up', 'full', 'timing', 'dance', 'best', 'Intermediates.Samba', 'Cheryl', 'again', 'dance', 'not', 'only', 'most', 'complex', 'also', 'highest', 'impact', 'dance', 'routines', 'routine', 'worst', 'cuing', 'Cheryl', 'just', 'out', 'Now', 'step', 'done', 'almost', 'none', 'moves', 'are', 'broken', 'down', 'However', 'rather', 'advanced', 'exerciser/dancer', 'loved', 'segment', 'most', 'somewhat', 'complex', 'steps', 'really', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', 'up.Mambo', 'Maks', 'routine', 'difficulty', 'WAY', 'down', 'again', 'level', 'Merengue', 'dance', 'very', 'much', 'cha-cha', 'only', 'cha-cha-cha', 'rhythm', 'very', 'easy', 'movements', 'are', 'big', 'kept', 'heart', 'rate', 'Samba.Toning', 'Now', 'was', 'favorite', 'part', 'entire', 'DVD', 'mixed', 'toning', 'stretching', 'create', 'feel-good', 'strengthening', 'workout', 'Cheryl', 'Maks', 'co-teach', 'routine', 'starting', 'out', 'squats', 'lunges', 'beginning', 'Next', 'come', 'more', 'balletic', 'toning', 'exercises', 'very', 'balletic', 'arms', 'Then', 'more', 'leg', 'toning', 'more', 'lunches', 'finally', 'toning', 'section', 'finished', 'push-ups', 'more', 'stretches.Overall', 'OK', 'Latin', 'dance', 'workout', 'Beginners', 'low', 'Intermediates', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'More', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'might', 'want', 'skip', 'DVD', 'though', 'are', 'huge', 'fans', 'show']",Dancing With The Stars: Latin Cardio Dance

1172787,A15IYME80HEGGD,B001BNFR80,"Cassandra Lee ""Lovin' it""","[1, 1]","While the cover says ""Latin Cardio Dance"" , I believe that this is more of a toning video. While some of the dances do raise your heatbeat up , I would say that this is more of a light cardio workout. However while this dvd may lack in some hardcore cardio , I still gave it 4 stars because of the toning in this video. With all these dances you felt your abs,buns, thighs,calfs, and arms working out. That is if you were passionate in your dancing.Now I would conisder myself an intermidate level when it comes to excersizing, however I will admit that their are still some days where I feel lazy and don't want to work out too hard. With this particular dvd , if you work lazily with it then yeah , your not going to sweat, or if your just doing small steps, not working to your full potiental then yeah this workout is going to dissapoint you. However today I did this workout today and I was sweating up a storm for the first time to this dvd. That's because I really got into the moves , instead of making my moves small , I started making them bigger such as twisting my hips more and taking bigger steps when doing front/back breaks. I have done this Dvd about 5 or  6 times and the first few times I wasn't sweating to any of it except on the toning section of this dvd. Today I was sweating up a storm though from beginning to end, because I was really giving it my all when doing the moves. I know this sounds like common sense, but is seems like a lot of reviewers are giving this a bad rep ,and I believe it's because they didn't give it thier all when doing the workout. Which is understandable, because the instructing in this video can be confusing or hard to understand at times (it is easier though then the other dancing with stars dvds )Anyways I wrote this so that the reviewers who gave a bad rating to this would maybe give it another chance, and for those of you who are thinking about getting this , but are getting nervous with all the negitive reviews on here, would be willing to give it a chance still.This dvd includes a customize option which is really nice if your short on time and want to fit in a bit of quickie. It includes a warm up , merangue , cha cha, samba ( which really got my heart rate up the most), mambo , and then a 15 minute routine of toning and sculpting , which really kicks your butt!I hope this review was helpful for those in doubt! have fun!",4,Maybe Cheryl is just a tad bit confused with cardio and toning.,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,2396,"['cover', 'Latin', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'believe', 'more', 'toning', 'video', 'dances', 'do', 'raise', 'heatbeat', 'up', 'would', 'say', 'more', 'light', 'cardio', 'workout', 'However', 'dvd', 'may', 'lack', 'hardcore', 'cardio', 'still', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'toning', 'video', 'dances', 'felt', 'abs', 'buns', 'thighs', 'calfs', 'arms', 'working', 'out', 'were', 'passionate', 'dancing.Now', 'would', 'conisder', 'intermidate', 'level', 'when', 'excersizing', 'however', 'will', 'admit', 'are', 'still', 'days', 'where', 'feel', 'lazy', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'work', 'out', 'too', 'hard', 'particular', 'dvd', 'work', 'lazily', 'then', 'yeah', 'not', 'going', 'sweat', 'just', 'doing', 'small', 'steps', 'not', 'working', 'full', 'potiental', 'then', 'workout', 'going', 'dissapoint', 'However', 'today', 'did', 'workout', 'today', 'was', 'sweating', 'up', 'storm', 'first', 'time', 'dvd', 'really', 'got', 'moves', 'instead', 'making', 'moves', 'small', 'started', 'making', 'bigger', 'such', 'twisting', 'hips', 'more', 'taking', 'bigger', 'steps', 'when', 'doing', 'front/back', 'breaks', 'have', 'done', 'Dvd', '5', '6', 'times', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'was', ""n't"", 'sweating', 'toning', 'section', 'dvd', 'Today', 'was', 'sweating', 'up', 'storm', 'beginning', 'end', 'was', 'really', 'giving', 'when', 'doing', 'moves', 'know', 'like', 'common', 'sense', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'are', 'giving', 'bad', 'rep', 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'thier', 'when', 'doing', 'workout', 'Which', 'understandable', 'instructing', 'video', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'hard', 'understand', 'times', 'easier', 'then', 'other', 'dancing', 'stars', 'dvds', 'Anyways', 'wrote', 'so', 'reviewers', 'who', 'gave', 'bad', 'rating', 'would', 'maybe', 'give', 'chance', 'who', 'are', 'thinking', 'getting', 'are', 'getting', 'nervous', 'negitive', 'reviews', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'give', 'chance', 'still.This', 'dvd', 'customize', 'option', 'really', 'nice', 'short', 'time', 'want', 'fit', 'bit', 'quickie', 'warm', 'up', 'merangue', 'cha', 'cha', 'samba', 'really', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', 'most', 'mambo', 'then', '15', 'minute', 'routine', 'toning', 'sculpting', 'really', 'butt', 'hope', 'review', 'was', 'helpful', 'doubt', 'have', 'fun']",Dancing With The Stars: Latin Cardio Dance
1172788,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B001BNFR80,Colleen M. Schneider,"[1, 1]","I enjoy dance workouts and took many years of dance training when I was growing up, mainly in jazz dance.  Dance for me is a fun way to get my work out in.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I borrowed this from our local library.  I enjoy the show and love to dance so I thought it was worth a go.  Weekly, I have dance workouts in my rotation and I especially like Lisa Nunziella's dvds. If you have done any type of latin or salsa style dance dvd's you will be familiar with the steps here: cha-cha, meringue, mambo & samba.  There were a few turns and a quick box step that could give you pause for a moment, but basically, this would be pretty easily followed by someone who had some experience with dance dvds.  That said, I believe that if you want to learn a few moves and are willing to practice a little bit, you could do this as a beginner.  The moves are broken down slowly and that gives you time to catch on to the moves.  If you want to learn and are willing to practice you could pick up the steps here if you were a newbie to dance.The dvd is approx. one hour long with a 5 minute warm-up, and about 10 minutes on each dance style (split instruction, by Max & Cheryl from the show).  You finish off with a nice dancers toning training/cool down, which includes some stretches and yoga moves to give your muscles a nice finish.Overall I had fun with it, but would probably not purchase as I would not be challenged enough.  One thing that I wish that this dvd had was a training section where they broke down the steps separate from the actual workout.  This would allow you to hit the ground running on the workout once you had practiced the steps.  Over time I don't want to have to slowly do the moves after I have long mastered them.  I prefer Lisa Nunziella's 5 day latin dance system due to the way she breaks down the steps away from the actual workout so I don't need to slow down.Bottom line-fun-doesn't seem like a workout, works your core very well, and when I wore my pedometer while working out I had logged in 4500 steps, so you are moving.  I would say though if you are beyond beginner, or have had dance experience whether by dvd or class, you may find this too slow for your tastes.",3,It's good if you are new to dance....,1275955200,"06 8, 2010",2010,2222,"['enjoy', 'dance', 'workouts', 'took', 'many', 'years', 'dance', 'training', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'mainly', 'jazz', 'dance', 'Dance', 'fun', 'way', 'get', 'work', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'borrowed', 'local', 'library', 'enjoy', 'show', 'love', 'dance', 'so', 'thought', 'was', 'worth', 'go', 'Weekly', 'have', 'dance', 'workouts', 'rotation', 'especially', 'Lisa', 'Nunziella', 'dvds', 'have', 'done', 'type', 'latin', 'salsa', 'style', 'dance', 'dvd', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'steps', 'here', 'cha-cha', 'meringue', 'mambo', 'samba', 'were', 'few', 'turns', 'quick', 'box', 'step', 'could', 'give', 'pause', 'moment', 'basically', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'easily', 'followed', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'experience', 'dance', 'dvds', 'said', 'believe', 'want', 'learn', 'few', 'moves', 'are', 'willing', 'practice', 'little', 'bit', 'could', 'do', 'beginner', 'moves', 'are', 'broken', 'down', 'slowly', 'time', 'catch', 'moves', 'want', 'learn', 'are', 'willing', 'practice', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'steps', 'here', 'were', 'newbie', 'dance.The', 'dvd', 'approx', 'one', 'hour', 'long', '5', 'minute', 'warm-up', '10', 'minutes', 'dance', 'style', 'split', 'instruction', 'Max', 'Cheryl', 'show', 'finish', 'off', 'nice', 'dancers', 'toning', 'training/cool', 'down', 'stretches', 'yoga', 'moves', 'give', 'muscles', 'nice', 'finish.Overall', 'had', 'fun', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'purchase', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'challenged', 'enough', 'One', 'thing', 'wish', 'dvd', 'had', 'was', 'training', 'section', 'where', 'broke', 'down', 'steps', 'separate', 'actual', 'workout', 'would', 'allow', 'hit', 'ground', 'running', 'workout', 'once', 'had', 'practiced', 'steps', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'slowly', 'do', 'moves', 'have', 'long', 'mastered', 'prefer', 'Lisa', 'Nunziella', '5', 'day', 'latin', 'dance', 'system', 'due', 'way', 'down', 'steps', 'away', 'actual', 'workout', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'slow', 'down.Bottom', 'line-fun-does', ""n't"", 'seem', 'workout', 'core', 'very', 'well', 'when', 'wore', 'pedometer', 'working', 'out', 'had', 'logged', '4500', 'steps', 'are', 'moving', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'beginner', 'have', 'had', 'dance', 'experience', 'dvd', 'class', 'may', 'find', 'too', 'slow', 'tastes']",Dancing With The Stars: Latin Cardio Dance

Cheryl seemed like she had planned everything out and killed all spontaneity.  A perfect example was when she went to the other dancers to show us the finer points of their moves --- it was so strangely stilted.  Maksim was on the other end, and seemed like he was making up the routine as he went.  I'm sure this wasn't true since the background dancers were in step with him --- so this made him more natural but made the routine seem a bit awkward.I've had minimal dance experience including a year of ballroom dance yeeeeears ago and did not have a problem picking up any moves even for those dances I had not learned before.  I felt they really did try to stick to the simple basics (except for one move that Cheryl threw in that was rather complex and seemed almost off the beat) which also made it rather dull (not much you can do about that sticking to basics.)  So it probably depends how much background you have and how quickly you pick up things.  They do not break it down oooooooone-twoooooooooo-threeeeeeee --- which would be appropriate for those who have 0 experience and/or maybe not that quick to pick up moves --- they show you one-two-three.As with all dance type videos I've seen thus far, I wish someone would find a nice way to present them as you would see them in a live class where the instructor is in front of you with their back to you so you can copy their moves (same left/right leg/turn direction) and see their front in a mirror.

1172795,A846NR0T5U8GT,B001BNFR80,Gia V.,"[1, 1]","Ok, truth be told I'm a little out of shape. I bought Dancing with Julianne and couldn't even go past the warm up. I figured that this Latin Cardio dvd would be similar. It starts up with a short warm-up and goes on to the merengue taught by Cheryl. This one is probably the only one of the dances that really uses your core. Then Maks teaches the Cha-cha. I happen to find that Maks goes a little slow in both his dances. Then Cheryl again with the Samba. This one reaches a point where it goes super fast, which is good, except you don't know the steps. The last dance is the Mambo by Maks. Again, a pretty slow dance. Then there's the exercise segment, which is actually very good. I finished the whole dvd in one take, but I will say that it wasn't pretty and I didn't do it right. It takes A LOT of patience to get the steps just right. And they don't take time to explain a lot, so if you're like me (with two left feet and no rhythm) this might take a looong time to get down just right. Overall, the dances where fairly short in comparison to say, Julianne's dvd or the Dance of the Pounds dvd. I didn't really feel my heart rate going until I got to the very end of the dvd (the exercise segment). HOWEVER, my legs were crazy sore, so much so that when I got to the exercise segment, I couldn't do many reps because my legs would literally TREMBLE. So obviously, my legs got a kick out of it (pun intended).This is a good video if you want to learn how to dance as well.

1172798,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B001BNFR80,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[39, 45]","As a long-time ""Dancing with the Stars"" fan, I was really surprised--just recently--to discover this 2008 Latin Cardio Dance workout. I had no clue such a product existed. I immediately ordered it, not having the faintest idea what the DVD would bring. Suffice it to say, I was ""very pleasantly surprised and pleased.""The DVD is 60 minutes of a great cardio workout. Even though other reviewers, who are already in great shape, were not particularly pleased, I am. It's been awhile since I have done a strenuous workout. Well, folks, you will get one here!! I have gone through the entire 60 minute program twice and have yet to complete each dance segment. (I'm too out-of-breath.)Here's what I found:1. Cheryl led the five-minute warm-up. These exercises must be universal because I did most of them with Jane Fonda back in the day. (Note: It is really fun to see Maksim going through these simple, slow routines as opposed to his lightning quick moves on the floor. He looks just like a normal guy in an aerobics class. Funny. Cheryl looks good.)2. Chery led the first workout, ""Merengue."" Her teaching style is simple and direct, yet encouraging. When she shows the next step, she has the class continue to do the preceding movement, then adds the new. Because this is a cardio workout, there is no stopping to show in detail what she is doing. That is the purpose of the rewind button. Better yet, do these routines in front of a mirror or sideways to your television screen so that you can better process what is next. I found facing the screen made me do double processing: seeing, translating to the other side of my body, then doing. Standing sideways eliminates the translating step.3. Cha-Cha is a 10-minute dance workout with Maksim. Surprise of surprises! Maksim is a patient teacher. Following his directions was a bit easier than following Cheryl. Each instructor, however, keeps viewers part of the team through focused directions. ""Keep your hands at waist level."" ""Keep your core tightened."" ""Focus on breathing. Don't hold your breath.""And so on.The Samba (Cheryl) and Mambo (Maksim) both follow the routine established in the first two dance workouts. What I learned throughout was how many of the steps I recognized from the competition. The viewer actually learns all the basic steps to the four dances, even including turns.The final workout is ""Dancer's Toning Workout,"" which Max says all ""students"" must go through before beginning rehearsal. It ""improves strength and flexibility...to develop and maintain a toned dancer's body"" (liner note).Overall, I recommend this cardio workout. It is a fun (?), instructional, beneficial way to increase your heart rate and learn all the steps to four dances. As I am pretty much out of shape (for a short while longer), I find the workout vigorous. I have already ordered the 2007 workout with Maksim, Kym, and Ashly teaching the Cha-Cha, Samba, Paso Doble (my favorite), and JiveDancing With the Stars - Cardio DanceHooray for ""Dancing with the Stars"" Dancing with the Stars.

I have done two other Dancing with the Stars DVDs, Dance Body Tone and Cardio Dance, and this one is definitely my favorite out of the three. In this one, the dances are explained more slowly and clearly, and the annoyingly inept instructors (Kym and Ahsly--especially Ashly) are dispensed with. The dances are much easier to learn and therefore more fun to do, since you can really get into them instead of spending the entire time trying to figure out what the instructors are talking about.However, this DVD is not without its flaws. For one, while Cheryl is quite good at slowly and carefully explaining things, she just doesn't have the right energy level. She talks slowly and dully, so I don't find her terribly motivating as a teacher. On top of that, she's constantly repeating herself: ""feel it in your core"" ""bend and straighten your legs"" etc. It gets tedious. We get it Cheryl. That's not really how you teach something, just saying the same obvious sentence over and over again. Maybe it would be helpful if she was repeating a difficult concept but bending and straightening the legs is generally pretty obvious when it comes to walking in place. Maksim's teaching style, however, is pretty good. He has a higher energy level and gives more helpful, less repetitive instructions.The other problem I have with this DVD is the lack of variety. All the dances on the DVD are pretty much the same, and utilize basically all the same steps. While this is good in a way, because it really gives you a chance to learn the moves, it gets a little boring after a while. Where the other DVDs were too complicated, this one is a bit too simple. In keeping the dances simple and easy to learn, they became homogenized. For instance, the instructors don't ever really give you anything specific to do with your arms or upper body. Maybe if they added some arms/upper body stuff to make the dances a bit more complex, there would be more variation overall. And because the dances are so simple and taught slowly, you don't get a huge cardio workout here. Some, sure, but you won't be breathing hard and begging for water afterward.All that being said, I will say that these dances are fun to do and their simplicity makes it easier to add your own flavor to the dances. I enjoy doing this DVD, I just don't think it's the best dance DVD out there. But if you're looking for something that's simple and gentle, that's broken down into short workouts that you can mix and match, and you like Latin dance, this DVD is not a bad place to start.",3,"My Favorite DWTS DVD so far, but still...

Well, they listened. This is taught going slow at first & speeds up quick, with much more teaching (though could still be more & several times cues are missing) & almost no needless banter. You can tell they really tried to keep the pace up so people don't say it has too much teaching or not moving.The classic ballroom music that myself & other people don't like as much as newer music, but that is the style/music they do on the show, so I guess I can't complain.This only has the choice of music w/instruction or just music, though you can customize which segments you want to do in the menu. This is what I feel gives these workouts the stiff & tedious feel & that Cheryl & Maksim keep to minimal teaching. Also they stay ""professional"" which usually means for anything, stiff & cold. I think their warmth does come through, it's just the producers/directors idea to stay formal.Warm-up - 4 minCheryl leads with all 2 other women, Maksim & 2 male dancers, basic isolation, hip & rib circles & stretching & etc.Merengue - 10 minCheryl leads with all other dances except Maksim. She teaches you the basic & then teaches several other variations. She does teach slow at first, but many times goes from a nice slow pace to the normal VERY fast true speed which is jarring for all the dances she teaches. This is like being in a real dance class, but sped up.Cha Cha - 10 minMaksim leads with all dancers except Cheryl.  He also teaches pretty well, going slow at first, he teaches front, back, side, crossovers, etc. He teaches also a couple steps at the end but barely teaches them.Samba -Cheryl leads with all other dances except Maksim. She does stay with a basic step touch way too much, but she puts great emphasis on the core & bounce & I did feel since I really exaggerated it.Toning - 15 minCheryl & Maksim take turns teaching w/all the dancers. Cheryl w/a lot of squats w/side leg lifts, lunges w/toros rotations. Maksim is next w/ballet is next w/plies & grand plies, side leg lifts, standing knee lift w/elbows behind head touch crunch, w/etc. basic step moves (ballet workouts especially NYC ballet is much better). Cheryl w/lunges with dance step style, knee lift w/step out. Maksim w/wide stance side stretch, deep lunges, plank w/leg lifts,  dolphin, static plank, push-ups, push-ups w/leg raised, breathe & done.Yes, the music. Unless you like old band style isa bit of a drag, but I like they always have you moving as they teach. I think they should have build up the slow to fast so it can be more accessible to beginners with left feet, & anyone who knows the routine can do it full speed during the instruction like I do with all my dance dvds.Speaking of which, most of these dances are basic 2-3 steps, step fwd/back or step to the side or cross. Most don't need a mirror or the instructor's back to you, but some really needed it as some will be lost. Considering they have all those backups, it's a waste they didn't have someone be a modifier of speed & another to always show their back. Having instructors face mirrors tend to make dance instructors more self-conscious, serious & concentrate on their form more then the teaching which makes it a bit more dull usually.Saying that, if you can get past the music, it's a good workout & they teach you many variations of each style in a short time. Yes, this is easier to follow then Cardio Dance for beginners, though I am glad I have played COUNTLESS dance workout dvds in the past, especially Zumba, etc.Another video clip: Collagevideo com",4,Dance workout in classic ballroom style & music 3 1/2 stars,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,3653,"['Many', 'people', 'including', 'complained', 'Dancing', 'w/the', 'Stars', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'had', 'too', 'little', 'teaching', 'too', 'much', 'fake', 'banter', 'Well', 'listened', 'taught', 'going', 'slow', 'first', 'up', 'quick', 'much', 'more', 'teaching', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'more', 'several', 'times', 'cues', 'are', 'missing', 'almost', 'needless', 'banter', 'can', 'tell', 'really', 'tried', 'keep', 'pace', 'up', 'so', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'teaching', 'not', 'moving.The', 'classic', 'ballroom', 'music', 'other', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'as', 'much', 'newer', 'music', 'style/music', 'do', 'show', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain.This', 'only', 'choice', 'music', 'w/instruction', 'just', 'music', 'can', 'customize', 'segments', 'want', 'do', 'menu', 'what', 'feel', 'stiff', 'tedious', 'feel', 'Cheryl', 'Maksim', 'keep', 'minimal', 'teaching', 'Also', 'stay', 'professional', 'usually', 'anything', 'stiff', 'cold', 'think', 'warmth', 'come', 'just', 'producers/directors', 'idea', 'stay', 'formal.Warm-up', '4', 'minCheryl', 'leads', '2', 'other', 'women', 'Maksim', '2', 'male', 'dancers', 'basic', 'isolation', 'hip', 'rib', 'circles', 'stretching', 'etc.Merengue', '10', 'minCheryl', 'leads', 'other', 'dances', 'Maksim', 'basic', 'then', 'several', 'other', 'variations', 'teach', 'slow', 'first', 'many', 'times', 'nice', 'slow', 'pace', 'normal', 'VERY', 'fast', 'true', 'speed', 'jarring', 'dances', 'being', 'real', 'dance', 'class', 'sped', 'up.Cha', 'Cha', '10', 'minMaksim', 'leads', 'dancers', 'Cheryl', 'also', 'pretty', 'well', 'going', 'slow', 'first', 'front', 'back', 'side', 'crossovers', 'etc', 'also', 'couple', 'steps', 'end', 'barely', 'teaches', 'them.Samba', '-Cheryl', 'leads', 'other', 'dances', 'Maksim', 'stay', 'basic', 'step', 'touch', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'great', 'emphasis', 'core', 'bounce', 'did', 'feel', 'really', 'exaggerated', 'it.Toning', '15', 'minCheryl', 'Maksim', 'take', 'turns', 'teaching', 'dancers', 'Cheryl', 'w/a', 'lot', 'squats', 'w/side', 'leg', 'lifts', 'w/toros', 'rotations', 'Maksim', 'next', 'w/ballet', 'next', 'w/plies', 'grand', 'plies', 'side', 'leg', 'lifts', 'standing', 'knee', 'lift', 'head', 'touch', 'crunch', 'w/etc', 'basic', 'step', 'moves', 'ballet', 'especially', 'NYC', 'ballet', 'much', 'better', 'Cheryl', 'dance', 'step', 'style', 'knee', 'lift', 'w/step', 'out', 'Maksim', 'w/wide', 'stance', 'side', 'stretch', 'deep', 'lunges', 'plank', 'w/leg', 'lifts', 'dolphin', 'static', 'plank', 'push-ups', 'push-ups', 'w/leg', 'raised', 'breathe', 'done.Yes', 'music', 'like', 'old', 'band', 'style', 'isa', 'bit', 'drag', 'like', 'always', 'have', 'moving', 'teach', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'build', 'up', 'slow', 'fast', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'accessible', 'beginners', 'left', 'feet', 'anyone', 'who', 'routine', 'can', 'do', 'full', 'speed', 'instruction', 'do', 'dance', 'dvds.Speaking', 'most', 'dances', 'are', 'basic', '2-3', 'steps', 'step', 'fwd/back', 'step', 'side', 'cross', 'Most', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'mirror', 'instructor', 'back', 'really', 'needed', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'Considering', 'have', 'backups', 'waste', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'someone', 'be', 'modifier', 'speed', 'always', 'show', 'back', 'Having', 'instructors', 'face', 'mirrors', 'tend', 'make', 'dance', 'instructors', 'more', 'self-conscious', 'serious', 'concentrate', 'form', 'more', 'then', 'teaching', 'bit', 'more', 'dull', 'usually.Saying', 'can', 'get', 'music', 'good', 'workout', 'teach', 'many', 'variations', 'style', 'short', 'time', 'Yes', 'easier', 'follow', 'then', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'beginners', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'played', 'COUNTLESS', 'dance', 'workout', 'dvds', 'past', 'especially', 'Zumba', 'etc.Another', 'video', 'clip', 'Collagevideo', 'com']",Dancing With The Stars: Latin Cardio Dance

There was a lot of standing and stepping with arms close.  My heartrate monitor never made it to a full cardio workout.2.  I thought that the instruction was just okay.  Not enough advanced warning as to what was coming up next.  Now we'll do a cha-cha and ""GO!""3.  I thought the instructors were not as ""fun"" as the first DWTS DVD.  They were monotone and almost boring. Not quite, but close.I really wanted to like this one because of the funtionality of it, but it didn't work for me....maybe for beginners?",3,Not my favorite...liked the original better,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,717,"['liked', 'DVD', 'was', 'customizable', 'can', 'choose', '40', 'minutes', 'dancing', 'and/or', '15', 'minutes', 'toning', '5', 'minute', 'warm-up', 'option', 'like', 'longer', 'workout.I', 'did', 'not', 'DVD', 'because:1', 'was', 'lot', 'standing', 'stepping', 'arms', 'close', 'heartrate', 'monitor', 'never', 'made', 'full', 'cardio', 'workout.2', 'thought', 'instruction', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'Not', 'enough', 'advanced', 'warning', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'up', 'next', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'do', 'cha-cha', 'GO', '3', 'thought', 'instructors', 'were', 'not', 'fun', 'first', 'DWTS', 'DVD', 'were', 'monotone', 'almost', 'boring', 'Not', 'quite', 'close.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'one', 'funtionality', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', '.maybe', 'beginners']",Dancing With The Stars: Latin Cardio Dance
