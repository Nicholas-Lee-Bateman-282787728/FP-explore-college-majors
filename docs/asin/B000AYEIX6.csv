Which, I guess, is fine (well...for ""adult contemporary"" dillitantes, anyway).  Still - Dearest-On-Earth and I watched her with glee on that ""CMI-Crossover"" thing with the group Heart, and, honestly, NEITHER entity has sounded so good since the mid-eighties.  But I digress...I know Wy is a Mom now and she...""used"" to be a wife, et cetera, et cetera, but where is the energy that she once exuded?  Did ""adulthood"" steal her energy?  Just one example:  On the ""CMI"" thing, long-time Zep fans, Heart, performed ""Rock And Roll"" with Wynonna, and, maybe because of the nature of the song, she actually recaptured some of her earlier...""energy.""  And when we saw her concert in Dayton, later that year (2005), she actually performed ""Rock And Roll"" as an encore - and bless her keyboard player's heart, he actually sounded like he was ""channelling"" the late, great pianist, Ian Stewart (who actually played piano on the original).  WHY wasn't that on this DVD?  We have it, and anything by Wynonna is great, I just wish that the DVD manifested some of her GREAT ""earlier energy.""",4,"""4"" because it's Wynonna, but ...well..EH...",1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,1278,"['Wynonna', 'much', 'absolutely', 'adored', 'was', 'teamed', 'Mom', 'guitarist', 'Don', 'Potter', 'was', 'so', 'VERY', 'very', 'integral', 'sound', 'just', 'be', 'mellowing', 'Which', 'guess', 'fine', 'well', 'adult', 'contemporary', 'dillitantes', 'anyway', 'Still', 'Dearest-On-Earth', 'watched', 'glee', 'CMI-Crossover', 'thing', 'group', 'Heart', 'honestly', 'NEITHER', 'entity', 'sounded', 'so', 'good', 'mid-eighties', 'digress', 'know', 'Wy', 'Mom', 'now', 'used', 'be', 'wife', 'et', 'cetera', 'et', 'cetera', 'where', 'energy', 'once', 'exuded', 'Did', 'adulthood', 'steal', 'energy', 'Just', 'one', 'example', 'CMI', 'thing', 'long-time', 'Zep', 'fans', 'Heart', 'performed', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Wynonna', 'maybe', 'nature', 'song', 'actually', 'recaptured', 'earlier', 'energy', 'when', 'saw', 'concert', 'Dayton', 'later', 'year', '2005', 'actually', 'performed', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'encore', 'bless', 'keyboard', 'player', 'heart', 'actually', 'sounded', 'was', 'channelling', 'late', 'great', 'pianist', 'Ian', 'Stewart', 'who', 'actually', 'played', 'piano', 'original', 'WHY', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'DVD', 'have', 'anything', 'Wynonna', 'great', 'just', 'wish', 'DVD', 'manifested', 'GREAT', 'earlier', 'energy']",N/A
934888,A2JAKHFYI88ZX0,B000AYEIX6,"Jake Z ""holden84""","[0, 0]","Wynonna's live album is a treat for listeners. This two disc live set chronicles her journey of 20 years in country music. From early hits as a member of the Judds, to her solo hits, to inspired covers, Wynonna does it all! It's great to hear her fine voice as usual, but it's also nice to hear the intimate stories she tells between songs. The stories are personal and the music is passionate. Highlights include cover songs like ""I'm The Only One"", ""The Best"", and classic hits like ""Is It Over Yet"", ""Love Is Alive"", ""To Be Loved By You"", etc. Vocally this is an impressive set as she goes from country to pop to blues and rock with no effort! She has an amazing voice! Wynonna is still going strong 20 years later!",5,Great concert,1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,718,"['Wynonna', 'live', 'album', 'treat', 'listeners', 'two', 'disc', 'live', 'set', 'journey', '20', 'years', 'country', 'music', 'early', 'hits', 'member', 'Judds', 'solo', 'hits', 'inspired', 'covers', 'Wynonna', 'great', 'hear', 'fine', 'voice', 'usual', 'also', 'nice', 'hear', 'intimate', 'stories', 'songs', 'stories', 'are', 'personal', 'music', 'passionate', 'Highlights', 'include', 'cover', 'songs', ""'m"", 'Only', 'One', 'Best', 'classic', 'hits', 'Over', 'Yet', 'Love', 'Alive', 'Be', 'Loved', 'etc', 'Vocally', 'impressive', 'set', 'country', 'pop', 'blues', 'rock', 'effort', 'amazing', 'voice', 'Wynonna', 'still', 'going', 'strong', '20', 'years', 'later']",N/A

Sometimes she's a bit overly-dramatic, but it is a truly wonderful journey through her music (Judds and Wynonna-Alone-a) and also quite a few covers.  I would spot out several in particular, but can't really, as they were all great.  &#34;I Can Only Imagine&#34; brought me to tears, as it always does.  &#34;People Get Ready&#34; spotlighted not only Wynonna's talent, but that of her accompanying singers (can't stand to call them back-ups with their vocal talent) Robert Bailey and Vicki Fleming.  &#34;Burning Love&#34; was a rouser, not that a Wynonna audience needs a reason to get up and dance.

I guess the moral of that story is ya never know What is around the bend and what you use to laugh at, now can't get enough of.A buddy had told me about Robert Bailey and had me hunt down his lps in the 80's (Bob is Ms. judd's Band leader and was grammy nomainted in the gospel feild prior to joining Wynonna) So...when Ms.Judd appeared on ""Soundstage"" (1993 I guess) I watched to see Bob doing his gig. I never expected to find Wynonna SO much to my Musical taste! From that point on my enjoyment of Wynonna grew into in ""all time Favorite"".I attended this great show earlier this year and it is wonderful to have it on DVD/cd.
