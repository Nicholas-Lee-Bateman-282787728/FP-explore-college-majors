The situation is a cross between Family Ties and Roseanne.  The parents (Mark Addy, Jamie Gertz) are fun loving & lazy, irresponsible compared to their own kids.  Their son (Taylor Ball) is an intelligent nerd with a dumb pretty sister and a much younger clever sister, so to that extent it's similar to Family Ties.  But the stories remind me more of Roseanne; at any rate it's just as good as either of those very funny shows.",5,Funniest show in years.,1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,515,"['favorite', 'sitcom', 'watch', 'reruns', 'year', 'locally', '4', 'am', 'situation', 'cross', 'Family', 'Ties', 'Roseanne', 'parents', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'Jamie', 'Gertz', 'are', 'fun', 'loving', 'lazy', 'irresponsible', 'compared', 'own', 'kids', 'son', 'Taylor', 'Ball', 'intelligent', 'nerd', 'dumb', 'pretty', 'sister', 'much', 'younger', 'clever', 'sister', 'so', 'extent', 'similar', 'Family', 'Ties', 'stories', 'remind', 'more', 'Roseanne', 'rate', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'very', 'funny', 'shows']",Still Standing

643774,A2LEJ063QW77GW,B00005JOXX,"Srinivas Chavala ""bobby""","[1, 49]","Still StandingI seen the entire series, that's the worse show I ever seen, since I watched Married with Children and According to Jim. I don't think they should make any more family shows, why don't leave the family shows to Nickelodeon or the Disney Channel. Watching this show is like watching Lizzie McGuire on Acid. Bill and Judy are the worse parents, I ever seen. If they were my parents, I put myself for adoption or I run away. Bill and Judy were in Sunnydale, East Great Falls M.I., Pleasantville, The O.C. or Smallville they wouldn't survive one day there. Vampires would kill them in a minute if they show up in Sunnydale. No, boring normal family would ever survive those places. If Brian was a vampire in Angel, he probably take them in a minute. He probably sire Lauren, I think she would of qualify. Bill and Judy Miller are like the suburban Richard and Emily Gilmore, Rex and Bree Van De Kamp from Desperate Housewives, Jim and Cheryl from According to Jim, George and Angie Lopez from George Lopez and Al and Peg Bundy from Married with Children. I always compare Brian to Clark Kent in Smallville, Steven Hyde from That 70's Show Chuck Sherman in American Pie and Seth Cohen from the O.C. Taylor Ball looks like a teen idol, the guy has a greatest resemblance of Benjamin McKenzie from the O.C., Tom Welling from Smallville and Brandon Routh from Superman Returns",2,Still Standing who they are?,1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,1382,"['Still', 'StandingI', 'seen', 'entire', 'series', 'worse', 'show', 'ever', 'seen', 'watched', 'Married', 'Children', 'According', 'Jim', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'make', 'more', 'family', 'shows', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'family', 'Nickelodeon', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Watching', 'show', 'watching', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'Acid', 'Bill', 'Judy', 'are', 'worse', 'parents', 'ever', 'seen', 'were', 'parents', 'put', 'adoption', 'run', 'away', 'Bill', 'Judy', 'were', 'Sunnydale', 'East', 'Great', 'Falls', 'M.I.', 'Pleasantville', 'O.C', 'Smallville', 'would', ""n't"", 'survive', 'one', 'day', 'there', 'Vampires', 'would', 'kill', 'minute', 'show', 'up', 'Sunnydale', 'No', 'boring', 'normal', 'family', 'would', 'ever', 'survive', 'places', 'Brian', 'was', 'vampire', 'Angel', 'probably', 'take', 'minute', 'probably', 'sire', 'Lauren', 'think', 'would', 'qualify', 'Bill', 'Judy', 'Miller', 'are', 'suburban', 'Richard', 'Emily', 'Gilmore', 'Rex', 'Bree', 'Van', 'De', 'Kamp', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Jim', 'Cheryl', 'According', 'Jim', 'George', 'Angie', 'Lopez', 'George', 'Lopez', 'Al', 'Peg', 'Bundy', 'Married', 'Children', 'always', 'compare', 'Brian', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Smallville', 'Steven', 'Hyde', '70', 'Show', 'Chuck', 'Sherman', 'American', 'Pie', 'Seth', 'Cohen', 'O.C', 'Taylor', 'Ball', 'teen', 'idol', 'guy', 'greatest', 'resemblance', 'Benjamin', 'McKenzie', 'O.C.', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Smallville', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Superman', 'Returns']",Still Standing
643775,A2EB6P4WBQ1HOH,B00005JOXX,"T. Brown ""BrightDuo""","[7, 7]","Despite the fact that my wife and I watch far too much television, we have stuck to syndicated sitcoms(Roseanne, Cheers, Friends, etc.) over the last few years due to what we have considered to be a poor turnout for new sitcoms.  We didn't tune-in to Still Standing until it was already in syndication, but we have made up for lost time by watching every airing available.  What makes the show work is that it's simply seamless... the acting, the writing, the rapport the characters share... everything works.  One litmus test that we've always used for family sitcoms is the interplay between the family members, and I've never seen a better representation of a real-life family than what Still Standing offers.  The contentious relationship between siblings Brian and Lauren rings true, especially when they meet in the middle to ridicule their parents, and watching parents Bill and Judy struggle to find a balance between neglecting and overparenting their children keeps the show grounded in reality.  Throw in the precocious Tina as the youngest daughter, and you have a TV family that actually behaves like a contemporary family.  I don't know why the show was cancelled, but all the great ones die young.  If you haven't given this show a chance, you're missing out.  My wife and I are eager for the show to be released on DVD.  We'll be first in line (or online).",5,Best Family Sitcom Ever!!!,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,1372,"['fact', 'wife', 'watch', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'television', 'have', 'stuck', 'syndicated', 'sitcoms', 'Roseanne', 'Cheers', 'Friends', 'etc', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'due', 'what', 'have', 'considered', 'be', 'poor', 'turnout', 'new', 'sitcoms', 'did', ""n't"", 'tune-in', 'Still', 'Standing', 'was', 'already', 'syndication', 'have', 'made', 'up', 'lost', 'time', 'watching', 'airing', 'available', 'What', 'show', 'work', 'simply', 'seamless', 'acting', 'writing', 'rapport', 'characters', 'share', 'everything', 'works', 'One', 'litmus', 'test', ""'ve"", 'always', 'used', 'family', 'sitcoms', 'interplay', 'family', 'members', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'better', 'representation', 'real-life', 'family', 'what', 'Still', 'Standing', 'offers', 'contentious', 'relationship', 'siblings', 'Brian', 'Lauren', 'rings', 'true', 'especially', 'when', 'meet', 'middle', 'ridicule', 'parents', 'watching', 'parents', 'Bill', 'Judy', 'struggle', 'find', 'balance', 'neglecting', 'overparenting', 'children', 'show', 'grounded', 'reality', 'Throw', 'precocious', 'Tina', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'have', 'TV', 'family', 'actually', 'contemporary', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'great', 'ones', 'die', 'young', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', 'show', 'chance', ""'re"", 'missing', 'out', 'wife', 'are', 'eager', 'show', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'line', 'online']",Still Standing
