Gicewicz ""blade2173""","[1, 1]","After learning that Rube has gone off to the great beyond, the reapers get a new boss who has a more efficient system that allows him time to pursue his own worldly desires.  Quickly, the group of reapers fall into their own desires while neglecting the rules that they have learned.  The result in each case is some minor obstacle for each reaper that seems to have virtually no bearing on the world at large.  This is in direct contrast to the series, which explained the exponential accumulation of disasters that can occur from a bad reap.  Realizing that their lives have experienced these minor, fleeting annoyances, the reapers decide to torture and murder their new boss.  If you are wondering how they came to this conclusion, I am as well.  Another inconsistency with the series is that George is able to retain the memories of her prior life after she reveals her presence to her sister, something that was shown to be impossible in the first season.  They also replaced Laura Harris as Daisy Adair, but they didn't really need to as her role is so minor, she was barely a part of the story.  Overall, it was a good movie, but it destroyed the mythos of the Dead Like Me universe, and didn't really make much sense as a film.",4,"Good story, but totally neglects plot points from the series",1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,1236,"['learning', 'Rube', 'gone', 'off', 'great', 'reapers', 'get', 'new', 'boss', 'who', 'more', 'efficient', 'system', 'time', 'pursue', 'own', 'worldly', 'desires', 'Quickly', 'group', 'reapers', 'fall', 'own', 'desires', 'neglecting', 'rules', 'have', 'learned', 'result', 'case', 'minor', 'obstacle', 'reaper', 'have', 'virtually', 'bearing', 'world', 'large', 'direct', 'contrast', 'series', 'explained', 'exponential', 'accumulation', 'disasters', 'can', 'occur', 'bad', 'reap', 'Realizing', 'lives', 'have', 'experienced', 'minor', 'fleeting', 'annoyances', 'reapers', 'decide', 'torture', 'murder', 'new', 'boss', 'are', 'wondering', 'how', 'came', 'conclusion', 'am', 'as', 'well', 'inconsistency', 'series', 'George', 'able', 'retain', 'memories', 'prior', 'life', 'presence', 'sister', 'something', 'was', 'shown', 'be', 'impossible', 'first', 'season', 'also', 'replaced', 'Laura', 'Harris', 'Daisy', 'Adair', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'role', 'so', 'minor', 'was', 'barely', 'part', 'story', 'Overall', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'destroyed', 'mythos', 'Dead', 'Me', 'universe', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'film']",Dead Like Me: Life After Death

When I saw there was a ""movie finale"" for the show, I was SO excited!  It was like a dream come true!  As I was watching the dvd, it didn't take long for my dream to turn into a nightmare.  I didn't feel it captured the true essence of the series AT ALL.  It was almost like the people who made this movie were just casual fans of the show.  I think the die hard fans could have written a way better movie, without even trying hard!  First, the obvious, NO DAISY.  She was one of my favorite characters ... to replace her with the ""wannabe"" version of daisy was just pathetic.  Honestly, I feel if Laura Harris was unavailable, they should have left Daisy out of the movie all together.  That would have helped the movie a little.  And not having Rube was another huge disappointment, as he was like the father of the group.  The head guy who replaced him in the movie was completely ridiculous.  I was glad when George told Reggie the truth, but the whole storyline with Reggie was so depressing and pointless in my opinion.  I think a better closure/ending for the movie would have been George seeing her ""heaven"" and walking off into it, like all the people whose souls she took in the past.  Now that would have been a satisfying ending.  Whoever made this movie, for future reference, you really should have die hard fans review your movie before its set in stone.  Otherwise, you get this... a million disappointed bitter Dead like Me fans!  If I had known it was this bad, I wouldn't have purchased the dvd.

It was the best written tv series l have seen (even beats Buffy the Vampire Slayer) with thoughtful but humorous story lines in each episode.  l just loved the premise behind the stories. The movie could have been better, some of the problems were likely due to low budget, but it was wonderful to see most of the characters again (thus 5 stars).  Reggie (Britt McKillip) was the real star of the movie; she is a great young actress and provided the best performance of the movie.  The new boss (he did not reap anyone) and replacement Daisy did not fit in at all.  The storylines in the movie did not run well together, compared to the series, George's interactions with the other reapers was missing.  Unlike other reviewers' l think the ending, which was great, unfortunately was complete and means a return of the series is not going to happen (hope l am wrong).  Things were wrapped up too completely.  However, for fans, this movie is a must-see despite limitations.

1206978,A2S3ZLA5CZU4Q7,B001JV5BHQ,C. L. Messina,"[1, 1]","I was reluctant to view this considering the bad reviews but it was a freebie on Netflix so, why not?First, the good. The directors reverted back to the Gravelings earlier temperament and mysterious nature. They became more of a sight gag/stale joke by the middle of Season 2.Georgia, Roxy and Mason play true to themselves for the most part, although Roxie is given a change of character that even the actress had difficulty reconciling with.Now, the bad. Well, not so much bad as questionable choices. Rube was out and his presence was missed. While I felt his character became too brash near the end of the series I still think he brought some sensibility and continuity to the plot. Without his guidance the group's character changes considerably and when that happens you have to consider how fans might accept that. Well, I'd consider it, the director didn't seem to.Daisy is played by another actress. Here's another odd choice considering Daisy was a replacement for Betty Rohmer (Rebecca Gayheart). If we've replaced Betty and replacing Rube, why not replace Daisy? What role did she fill considering long time fans could never be satisfied by another actor in the same role? I won't judge the stand in actress so much as the writers/director for trying to convince us a Ford and Chevy with the same name are the same thing.Reggie is grown up. I didn't recognize Britt McKillup at first but it's the same actress. Only problem is she's normal as chips. She gets along perfectly with her mom which makes a long time viewer like me wonder if the director ever saw the show. True, her older self would likely be better adjusted and get along with her mother better but that tension is what made the Georgia family storyline interesting. Without the tension their scenes are flat and don't move the plot much. Also her 'hidden romance' with the quarterback is... Kind of pathetic. I'm wishing for an early death for the guy but it never seems to come.Georgia's mom has been kidnapped by an alien. OK, maybe not, but the woman in this movie is not the same character in the series even though the same actress is playing her. Here, Joy Lass is the most patient, understanding, sympathetic woman in the world with time for every little emotional pity party her daughter throws. EVEN if Joy suddenly became best friends with her daughter her underlying tension and impatience would still be there- that's who she is! This was the hardest part for me to watch.Delores Herbig is the same but she and Georgia have been transplanted from 'Office Space' Happy-Time to what looks like the office Erin Brockowitz got after her firm won the big lawsuit. There are no quirks or mishaps and the scenes could have been filmed in Delores house for better effect. Oh yeah, that might have been funny so they couldn't do that.And there, perhaps, is the biggest travesty- there is little, if any humor in this production. I'll concede the humor felt a little forced near the end of the series but it was still important, particularly when dealing with a slightly grim topic. The only humor they could muster was the hacking and burning of the Rube replacement- scenes that reminded me more of Goodfellows than a quirky show about grim reapers stuck on Earth munching Waffles.Lastly, and this is a direct shot at the director, the pace, music and lighting feel WAYYYYYY too much like a Lifetime Channel made for TV movie.The writers and director claimed they were trying to make something different for the 'big screen'.

1206981,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,B001JV5BHQ,DarthJustice,"[2, 2]","I can still remember hearing about the follow-up movie they were making for Dead Like Me. Being Dead Like Me is my favorite TV series and there were talks of possibly doing a third season if the movie did well enough (though I never believed they really would if you want to know the truth), I was excited.Now I find myself sometimes literally forgetting it even exists. I'm not saying this as to trash the movie but just as an honest, truthful, and literal observation.In DLM: LAD, we find ourselves and our favorite grim reapers still in Seattle a few years post the series. Sadly, we find out that Rube got his lights literally just before the movie begins and the reapers find out they have a new boss, Cameron Kane, who is a far cry from Rube and his leadership traits (but is intentionally done so).It's with Cameron that a good bulk of the plot revolves, or at least half. Eventually all the reapers come to agree with George that Kane needs to go and they (sans George) set out to get rid of him any way possible.Then we have the family side of the plot. Reggie is now in her mid-teens, no longer really that ""odd child"" she was in the series but is still more or less far from being popular, and is secretly dating a football player who is dating a popular girl who dislikes Reggie. Joy has turned her grief over George into helping other families and parents in similar situations. Clancy only gets a passing mention as having moved on and has a new family now.Mostly however, the movie deals with Reggie finally discovering George is still around and is a grim reaper.Of the two, I enjoyed the George/Reggie plot better and I wish it had been the primary focus.Admittedly, there wasn't many things I can say I particularly liked about the movie. There weren't many, if any, moments that made me ""laugh out loud"", for example. Probably the one thing I can say I really liked was they managed to give real conclusion to the series, at least for George, if this turns out to be it for DLM. I won't ruin what happens to her, but it pretty much is a great way to conclude her arc as a grim reaper.As for what I particularly disliked, I'll start off with Rube and Daisy. This is probably the most commonly agreed item about what was wrong with the movie. Rube (Mandy Patinkin) was not in the movie at all. His absence was missed. Then there's ""Daisy"". Like Mandy Patinkin, Laura Harris was unable to return due to other commitments. Unlike Rube, however, they simply replaced the actress.Now, I don't know how well of an actress the woman is as this is the only thing I've seen her in. Nonetheless, she was not a very good actress for Daisy. It was almost like watching a completely different version of the character seen in the series.Then there are the reaper rules. Pretty much every rule set up in the show was thrown out the window for the movie. A good example is during one scene, a man is trying to leave his body without being reaped by a reaper.

I mean the fans of ""Dead Like Me"", the cult favorite TV show that was itself reaped after only two seasons.  Be warned that this review contains some details required for a decent review that some readers may consider spoilers.This movie picks up 3 years after the series ended, as the Reapers must adjust to major changes in their by-now well-patterned afterlives.  ""Der WaffelHaus"" has burned to the ground and their patriarch Rube has received his lights and departed.  His replacement, a Type-A maverick (Cameron) wastes no time in setting up a new order in the organization, beginning with handing out assignment via texting rather than Post-Its.  More of Rube's rules go by the wayside as he allows each of the Reapers to break discipline and follow their individual desires for wealth (Mason), fame (Daisy), success (Roxy), and closure (George) at the expense of their afterlife responsibilities.  When things begin to sour, however, they finally appreciate the validity of Rube's rules.Some criticisms of this DVD are justified - the movie revives the show without really expanding upon it and the underlying mythology, but this is mostly because the movie attempts to simultaneously address too many topics that inevitably accompany a 3-year lapse.  Even so, the series' quirky gallows humor that first appealed to me is still there (the group's attempts to find a final solution to their problems with Cameron is hilarious), and Ellen Muth as George is still a treat to watch as she continues to sort out the afterlife of someone who is ""Dead Like Me"".",5,Deadheads rejoice,1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,1614,"['not', 'afficianaods', 'late', 'Jerry', 'Garcia', 'mean', 'fans', 'Dead', 'Me', 'cult', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'reaped', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'Be', 'warned', 'review', 'details', 'required', 'decent', 'review', 'readers', 'may', 'consider', 'spoilers.This', 'movie', 'up', '3', 'years', 'series', 'ended', 'Reapers', 'must', 'adjust', 'major', 'changes', 'by-now', 'well-patterned', 'afterlives', 'Der', 'WaffelHaus', 'burned', 'ground', 'patriarch', 'Rube', 'received', 'lights', 'departed', 'replacement', 'Type-A', 'maverick', 'Cameron', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'new', 'order', 'organization', 'beginning', 'handing', 'out', 'assignment', 'texting', 'rather', 'Post-Its', 'More', 'Rube', 'rules', 'go', 'wayside', 'Reapers', 'break', 'discipline', 'follow', 'individual', 'desires', 'wealth', 'Mason', 'fame', 'Daisy', 'success', 'Roxy', 'closure', 'George', 'expense', 'afterlife', 'responsibilities', 'When', 'things', 'begin', 'sour', 'however', 'finally', 'appreciate', 'validity', 'Rube', 'rules.Some', 'criticisms', 'DVD', 'are', 'justified', 'movie', 'show', 'really', 'expanding', 'underlying', 'mythology', 'mostly', 'movie', 'simultaneously', 'address', 'too', 'many', 'topics', 'inevitably', '3-year', 'lapse', 'Even', 'so', 'series', 'quirky', 'gallows', 'humor', 'first', 'appealed', 'still', 'group', 'attempts', 'find', 'final', 'solution', 'problems', 'Cameron', 'hilarious', 'Ellen', 'Muth', 'George', 'still', 'treat', 'watch', 'sort', 'out', 'afterlife', 'someone', 'who', 'Dead', 'Me']",Dead Like Me: Life After Death

Troutman,"[1, 1]","Except for Sarah Wynter's execrable take on Daisy, which broke the spell way too many times and prompted the loss of a star, this is a fine update on our band of Grim Reapers, one which I very much enjoyed. Taking place 5 years after our last contact with the group, you realize that life after death also moves on. And, as with the living, reapers can change...or stagnate.While I missed Rube and Kiffany and Der Waffle Haus, Rube's disappearance was explained well enough and - let's face it - undead characters can't have the luxury of enjoying mortal attachments forever. Der Waffle Haus had become more than a quiet meeting place by the end of the 2nd season and I was beginning to be a bit uncomfortable with the continual stretching of the boundaries between living and dead there - it was almost Grand Central Reaper, what with gravelings fighting over Halloween candy two booths over, stubborn souls and reapers who used to work for Rube popping in and Kiffany appearing to take food orders during a heated discussion on soul-taking and supposedly never hearing a thing - and so I can certainly see the point of shaking up their working routine.While I didn't like the new head reaper, as was intended, Henry played the part well and I didn't feel a disconnect, as I saw his take as very much in line with the feel of the Ray character in 2nd season. Plus, his character's actions and attitude served as a very effective backdrop to highlight the reapers' current personalities and foibles, and were necessary to facilitate the interaction between George and Reggie - something Rube would never have allowed.Happy Time becomes simply a room in which the Delores/Millie relationship is staged and thus much less important, again in line with the growth in the characters.  Working at Happy Time is simply a part of George's 'life' after 5 years, not a new and strange thing to negotiate. Millie and Delores have become even closer over the years and Millie has become a trusted working associate as well as a surrogate daughter. That relationship is handled extremely well.The real meat of this movie, and to me the most satisfying and moving aspect, is George's growing maturity and self-awareness of herself as a person with social - and cosmic - value and has learned that reaping must trump her personal feelings, as is so sadly exampled. The other reapers have changed and learned very little about themselves and life in the past five years, but George - ah, George.George's interaction with Reggie shows a level of maturity and understanding that Joy Lass never exhibited in any episode.

1207012,A4KJTS5P78ICU,B001JV5BHQ,K. Futrell,"[1, 2]",Dead Like Me: Life After Death was a pretty good movie. I don't think it was as good as the series but it is pretty good. I think it would of been better with the original Daisy and Rube in it. The new Daisy is horrible and the new boss isn't much better in the movie.Short Summary: There is a new boss in town and the reapers have to follow his commands. Only to find out that the new boss schedules the reapings too close together and gives Daisy more than one reap. The new boss definetly isn't Rube and he doesn't care about the reapers like Rube did. The gang rebels and doesn't do the reapings like they are suppose to and it leads George to tell her sister that she is a reaper. I would have to say that George telling Reggie that she is a grim reaper and hanging out with Reggie a little bit is the BEST part of the entire movie. Watch the movie to see if the grim reapers can get rid of their new boss and get back into action...Overall I think this is a really good movie with room for improvement but hopefully they will bring back the series.,4,Dead Like Me is Back,1235001600,"02 19, 2009",2009,1054,"['Dead', 'Me', 'Life', 'Death', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'series', 'pretty', 'good', 'think', 'would', 'been', 'better', 'original', 'Daisy', 'Rube', 'new', 'Daisy', 'horrible', 'new', 'boss', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'movie.Short', 'Summary', 'new', 'boss', 'town', 'reapers', 'have', 'follow', 'commands', 'Only', 'find', 'out', 'new', 'boss', 'reapings', 'too', 'close', 'together', 'Daisy', 'more', 'one', 'reap', 'new', 'boss', 'definetly', ""n't"", 'Rube', ""n't"", 'care', 'reapers', 'Rube', 'did', 'gang', 'rebels', ""n't"", 'do', 'reapings', 'are', 'suppose', 'George', 'tell', 'sister', 'reaper', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'George', 'telling', 'Reggie', 'grim', 'reaper', 'hanging', 'out', 'Reggie', 'little', 'bit', 'BEST', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'Watch', 'movie', 'see', 'grim', 'reapers', 'can', 'get', 'rid', 'new', 'boss', 'get', 'back', 'action', 'Overall', 'think', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'room', 'improvement', 'hopefully', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'series']",Dead Like Me: Life After Death

I could hardly wait to see it. Then I spoke to a fellow Dead Like Me friend and he said the movie was wretched. I decided to watch it anyway thinking that perhaps since I had lowered expectations after hearing his opinion (which is usually spot on with the same tests) I was still devastated at the terrible quality of this movie.First of all, Rube is gone. This is just wrong. Its like having oreos and no milk, popcorn without butter, the A-team without Mr. T. He was THE GUY and now he's gone. Another reviewer said that we should remember that he chose not to do it. Perhaps this is because the script was a bunch of drivel. His replacement, this uber-sleazy guy named Cameron just makes my skin crawl. Halleljuah he plays such a teeny part in the overall movie but his scenes just make you want to cringe. Second, they changed the actress who plays Daisy. Daisy is of course always obnoxious and self-absorbed but this actress is just plain awful. Daisy had her fleeting selfless moments on the show but this actress is super whiny and grates on your nerves the way she talks. And then there is Mason, who had his funny moments in the show and was always a little ""me, me, me"" but comic in relief in the show. They ruin that here too, Mason is a womanizing ridiculous idiot shadow of his former character and nothing he did was funny. He was mostly just annoying, which is too bad because he was my favorite in the series.I have nothing great to say about this movie. All the characters including the regulars have changed, mostly for the worst and they seemed to have abandoned the entire Grim Reaping angle. It sits on a back burner for most of the movie and George's peformance borders on more of anguished than her usual spunk KMA attitude. What a shame. The show was wonderful but this is just crud.

Dead Like Me has two wonderful seasons on Showtime before it was axed.  The show was developing and deepening with its second season of course and then months later it was canceled.  The cast and crew were pretty stubborn and refused to give up on the show.  No other network would take it and still most came together to make this straight to DVD film.  There are definitely aspects of the show that are missing.  The special effects are less, even hair and make up suffered but still I admire the creators for trying to keep the show together.  The story in this film is nice and keeps the spirit of the show.  There is still something a bit leaden and not light enough to keep the idea alive.  Humor falls flat and the story is just not a great as the episodes have been.  Still Dead Like Me is watchable and well recommended if you are a fan of the show.

There is a quasi explanation on the DVD but in breaking the rules it changed the nature of the reapers and the entire way in which they interact with each other and the world.The biggest golden rule (so to speak) was the reapers could not interact with members of their human life or they would lose their memories. In the movie, Reggie interacts with her sister which would seem to have great depth for a storyline but the entire thing ended up being trite.The original actress that played Daisy is also replaced and the newcomer just does not measure up. Gone is the ditzy but multi-faceted Daisy and in her place just a ditz. Roxy, who always was the more steadfast of the group, out of the blue, as if never tempted before, grabbed that chalice of wild abandon and drank from it to then ""run a muck.""

It managed (at least in its first season) to be touching, funny, insightful, and well...""magical"" often at the same time.  A lot of that had to do with the strong cast, particularly Ellen Muth and Mandy Patinkin.But something happened in the second season.  The show didn't instantly fall apart, but the story-lines and humor became rather forced and lame in my opinion, and sometimes, death was a little too visceral and too much like a real life news story (I cringed watching the Reapers attend a mass murder at an office).  So I wasn't too surprised to see the series canceled.But I still remember with great fondness Season One, and I was very pleasantly surprised to see that five years after the fact, they gave the series a finale (or maybe not a finale but just another installment) with this movie.""Dead Like Me:  Life after Death"" is not perfect.  The absence of Mandy Patinkin, George's gruff but kindly boss, and the woman who played the vivacious but vulnerable Daisy were definitely minuses.  But the rest of the key cast was there and did a great job.  And the story had some touching moments.

Daisy Adair is played by a different actress, Sarah Wynter, who doesn't hold a candle to Laura Harris, who played Daisy in the series. Rather than being a superficial, but talented and clever, materially-driven woman, Daisy is now nothing more than an air-headed wanna-be. Her character has been utterly destroyed. Meanwhile, the character Roxie apparently has no problem breezing past lines she never would have even come close to consider crossing previously. The plot stretches credulity past the breaking point, and is entirely unimaginative.The one point of strong satisfaction from the movie is that Georgia finally reveals herself to her sister Reggie. While very satisfying, it also feels like committing a cardinal sin, and in any case it was an easy, low-hanging fruit for the writers to grab that certainly didn't involve any skill to come up with.On the whole, the movie was extremely painful for me to watch. If it had been any other movie, I would have simply stopped watching after 20, 30 minutes tops; but I needed closure. But it was so bad, that my wife has said she's considering writing her own ending to the series, just so she could forget this one.Don't buy this movie, unless you're such a die-hard fan that you actually don't care if it completely sucks (think Star Wars Episode I, only a bit worse).

Now, having watched it for a third time, it's actually pretty good.  I agree with many that Daisy, Daisy Adair was horribly mis-cast and should have either been given her lights, like Rube or they should have waited for the original actress to be available.  I was very pleased that they got most of the original cast back, it made the movie seeing them all again.I did not like the new boss, I am glad they got rid of him by the end.  I was sorry to see Der Waffle Haus go, maybe it was a chain and they could find another one, I missed Kiffany.

The loss of Rube (played by Mandy Patinkin in the series) was clearly felt as his replacement (Cameron Kane played by Henry Ian Cusick) fails to lead and offers little to the plot line. Left rudderless, the reapers bend the rules that Rube had enforced with predictable problematic results. George's decision to reveal herself to her younger sister is a key sub-plot that also comes off awkwardly.

I'm just asking fans to cut it some slack, the movie is actually pretty good if you watch it with an open mind and remember that its been a few years since the series ended.  To me, it did tie up some story lines.The one thing I didn't like was the use of a new Daisy,(in my opinion you should never replace an actor, they should of waited for the original)and no Rube.  But in the movie's defense having no Rube, created a lot of the story line.  It gave Georgia's character new stuff to deal with.  Mind you, yes, a lot of the characters are taken into a different direction than the series, but if you watch the additional footage in the special features, the director explains why they made the decisions they did.  While I may not like every aspect, I did appreciate the effort to bring these characters back, it was like revisiting old friends.

As nostalgic as watching it is, it's also a new beginning for both the characters and the audience.  There is a lot of emotion here, and if you're anything thing like me--that is, invested in these characters--it just might make you weep.An interesting bit is that some of the plot lines from the series are paid off, such as some stuff with Murray and George's family.  There is a lot of closure here for Reggie and her mother, so if you felt the finale of the series lacked... well, finality, you might be happier with this.  It's by no means a definite end, as there is definitely more to be said about the characters, but if it did end here, I would be satisfied with the story that was told.  I loved the majority of the show, but I did feel that the second season had trouble blending the humor and drama in an organic way, but the movie--for the most part--is able to pull it off.Now, onto the not so shiny stuff.  We've got no Rube and we've got no Laura Harris to play Daisy Adaire.  Sarah Wynter fills in for Harris, and she does a better job than I expected, but the whole same-character-different-actor thing is too strange for me.  They wrote around Rube, and should have wrote around Daisy.  Also, the continuity is iffy.  The repercussions of a reap left un-reaped were made clear in the pilot, and the ""you lose your memories when you talk to your family"" clause is gone, though I suppose the last one can be explained.  Maybe a higher power knew George had to talk to Reggie?  I don't know.

1207038,A3PWPNZVMNX3PA,B001JV5BHQ,rareoopdvds,"[4, 4]","This straight-to-video movie of the ""hit"" show Dead Like Me does not quite capture the charm of the original series. Ellen Muth is back as George Lass, the girl who died from being hit with a toilet seat that fell from space at the age of 18. The original TV show is incredibly witty, charming, funny and poignant about life and death, while this new movie, fails largely due to the lack of Mandy Patinkin as Rube. This is a glaring problem for the shows quick-witted humor and warmth. He provided the proper father figure for George.In place of Rube is Cameron (Henry Ian Cusack from Lost) who is a corporate form of the death dealer. Because Rube had ""found his lights"", Cameron steps in. Instead of post-its, they get blackberry's. So death has pushed the technological envelope. So be it. Others are back to reprise their roles like Mason (Callom Blue) and Roxie (Jasmine Guy). Daisy Adair who was played perfectly in the show by Laura Harris, was replaced by Sarah Wynter. Although she was fine, she did not have the same appeal. They should have just made her a new character.This movie does not really seem to find its center, in either the characters or the story, and so its meandering around various dilemmas that do not add up to much. Its great to see Ellen Muth reprising her role as George, but even she cannot make this boat float too far without searching for another life boat.The original show was cancelled after only 2 seasons, which is unfortunate as it was one of the better shows on TV at the time. It has a strong fan following which is why this movie exists, however, it is 5 years after the cancellation, so it seems really a muted point by now. The gesture is nice, but not necessary.Ellen Muth was surprising in this show, yet, its unfortunate that she has not taken too many roles after the original show was cancelled. According to IMDB she has done some work, but nothing prominent or worthy of mention.This movie is really for the fans. Its not to inspire new fans as the show is dead.

This despite thinking that Ellen Muth is outrageously cute. But what can you do? I never had Showtime. I actually recorded this thinking it was the original pilot (and that someone was finally going to show the series on basic cable). Seems I was, well, a tad wrong. I've spent pieces of the last half-hour reading about how much worse than the show it is. Must have been an incredible show. I missed all the plot inconsistencies and the like, obviously. I have no idea about the rules of this universe. Coming into it cold, it wasn't bad. It wasn't good, mind you, but it wasn't bad.I'm not going to stick to my usual review format for this, because giving a plot synopsis seems redundant. And because of all the stuff I read about plot holes, etc., which makes me think that if you haven't seen the series, pretty much anything I say about the movie is going to be a spoiler. Thus I'll stick with commenting on the acting (generally decent, though no one was truly great), the script (I'll leave it to the experts to discover plot inconsistencies; I found it half-witty and half-treacle), the the direction (competent). My usual stuff, in other words. I did kind of expect more, after all the wonderful things I've heard about the show, but rather than taking it as a feature film I took it as an extended TV show episode; looked at that way, I found it at least enjoyable enough to keep watching. It ain't House, or even the last few seasons of The X-Files, but watchable nonetheless. ** ",3,Amusing.,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,1701,"['Dead', 'Me', 'Death', 'Stephen', 'Herek', '2009', ""'m"", 'probably', 'one', 'handful', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'came', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'single', 'episode', 'TV', 'show', 'extended', 'epilogue', 'thinking', 'Ellen', 'Muth', 'outrageously', 'cute', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'never', 'had', 'Showtime', 'actually', 'recorded', 'thinking', 'was', 'original', 'pilot', 'someone', 'was', 'finally', 'going', 'show', 'series', 'basic', 'cable', 'Seems', 'was', 'well', 'tad', 'wrong', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'pieces', 'last', 'half-hour', 'reading', 'how', 'much', 'worse', 'show', 'Must', 'have', 'been', 'incredible', 'show', 'missed', 'plot', 'inconsistencies', 'like', 'obviously', 'have', 'idea', 'rules', 'universe', 'Coming', 'cold', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'mind', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'stick', 'usual', 'review', 'format', 'giving', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'redundant', 'stuff', 'read', 'plot', 'holes', 'etc.', 'think', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'say', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'spoiler', 'Thus', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'commenting', 'acting', 'generally', 'decent', 'one', 'was', 'truly', 'great', 'script', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'experts', 'discover', 'plot', 'inconsistencies', 'found', 'half-witty', 'half-treacle', 'direction', 'competent', 'usual', 'stuff', 'other', 'words', 'did', 'kind', 'expect', 'more', 'wonderful', 'things', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'show', 'rather', 'taking', 'feature', 'film', 'took', 'extended', 'TV', 'show', 'episode', 'looked', 'way', 'found', 'least', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'ai', ""n't"", 'House', 'even', 'last', 'few', 'seasons', 'X-Files', 'watchable', 'nonetheless', '**']",Dead Like Me: Life After Death

While I was a huge fan of the too soon cancelled series ""Dead Like Me"", this movie I thought fell flat. For starters losing May Patinkin who played Rube was a huge loss to the cast. Plus the multi-dimensional character Daisy who was originaly played by Laura Harris was replaced by Sarah Wynter in this movie. Sarah Wynter although a fine actress really didn't do the character justice in my opinion; her Daisy came off as just a shallow floozie wherereas, in the series she was deeper than it seemed. Also, the fabulous original director of the series was James Whitmore, Jr., he was replaced in this movie by Stephen Herek and you could definitely tell. In the original series the viewer was really touched and forced to think about life and death, the characters were all finding themselves even in death and growing regardless.
