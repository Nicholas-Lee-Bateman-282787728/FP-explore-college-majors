1069878,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000PC72LS,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The Mystery of Mr. Wong, 1939 filmThe movie starts with a view of a foggy bay. A man throws a package from a ship, another man in a boat retrieves it and then lands on a dock. He goes to a mansion and commands the maid. Does the maid have a secret? There is conflict in this house. That jewel has a curse on it. There is a party that night, Mr. Wong arrives. The owner was threatened with death! They play a game of charades. A man fires a gun, another man falls. But this is not play acting, Brendan is dead! The police are called, but they received the call twenty minutes before! Who tampered with the gun? The detective questions Harrison about his quarrel with Edwards. He won't talk. That letter in the safe is gone! Mr. Wong tests that letter, it has an unusual paper. The fatal bullet did not come from Harrison's pistol. It is a murder not an accident. Edwards was changing his will to disinherit his wife.Detective Street questions the people while they are in a group. [Not realistic?] Wong questions the lawyer. Does Sing know something? A man and a woman talk in the garden. Will the maid send a letter to Wong? Smoking isn't healthy for one person. Who put a ladder by a window? Wong borrows a cigarette. The killer is in the house! Sing can't talk to Wong. Wong talks to Detective Street, who goes to the Edwards home. Where is that letter? Mrs. Edwards goes to see Wong, so does Harrison. Wong knows the facts about Stroganoff. Wong questions the gathered people and names the murderer. Was it the result of family revenge? Detective Street arrives to arrest the guilty. [Note the handshake with Wong.] ""Goodnight Mr. Wong!"" Then Wong explains how he solved the crime.Can a stolen national treasure be returned to its rightful owner? This story follows the convention where a powerful and crooked or nasty man ends up as the murder victim. [An argument for good manners?] Followers of the ""Mr. Wong"" series will want to see this, but its not the best of the series.",2,Murder in a Mansion,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,1981,"['Mystery', 'Mr.', 'Wong', '1939', 'filmThe', 'movie', 'view', 'foggy', 'bay', 'man', 'package', 'ship', 'man', 'boat', 'then', 'dock', 'mansion', 'maid', 'maid', 'have', 'secret', 'conflict', 'house', 'jewel', 'curse', 'party', 'night', 'Mr.', 'Wong', 'owner', 'was', 'threatened', 'death', 'play', 'game', 'charades', 'man', 'gun', 'man', 'not', 'play', 'acting', 'Brendan', 'dead', 'police', 'are', 'called', 'received', 'call', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Who', 'tampered', 'gun', 'detective', 'questions', 'Harrison', 'quarrel', 'Edwards', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'letter', 'safe', 'gone', 'Mr.', 'Wong', 'letter', 'unusual', 'paper', 'fatal', 'bullet', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'Harrison', 'pistol', 'murder', 'not', 'accident', 'Edwards', 'was', 'changing', 'will', 'disinherit', 'wife.Detective', 'Street', 'questions', 'people', 'are', 'group', 'Not', 'realistic', ']', 'Wong', 'questions', 'lawyer', 'Sing', 'know', 'something', 'man', 'woman', 'talk', 'garden', 'Will', 'maid', 'send', 'letter', 'Wong', 'Smoking', ""n't"", 'healthy', 'one', 'person', 'Who', 'put', 'ladder', 'window', 'Wong', 'cigarette', 'killer', 'house', 'Sing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'Wong', 'Wong', 'talks', 'Detective', 'Street', 'who', 'Edwards', 'home', 'Where', 'letter', 'Mrs.', 'Edwards', 'see', 'Wong', 'so', 'Harrison', 'Wong', 'facts', 'Stroganoff', 'Wong', 'questions', 'gathered', 'people', 'murderer', 'Was', 'result', 'family', 'revenge', 'Detective', 'Street', 'arrest', 'guilty', '[', 'Note', 'handshake', 'Wong', ']', 'Goodnight', 'Mr', 'Wong', 'Then', 'Wong', 'how', 'solved', 'crime.Can', 'stolen', 'national', 'treasure', 'be', 'returned', 'rightful', 'owner', 'story', 'convention', 'where', 'powerful', 'crooked', 'nasty', 'man', 'up', 'murder', 'victim', '[', 'argument', 'good', 'manners', ']', 'Followers', 'Mr.', 'Wong', 'series', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'not', 'best', 'series']",N/A

Karloff works very smoothly in character.  No real surprises as far as story goes, you could probably switch in and out with any of the other &#34;detectives&#34; in the genre and Mr. Wongs ethnic background is barely a factor in the story. What made the character a little richer are the references he make to his schooling in Heidelburg and other colleges.
