Barrows,"[19, 21]","The good: nice to have some older footage of Santana since there is nothing else available from the 70's and it's cool to see Gregg Rolie and Neal Schon in the pre-Journey days. Some of the footage is really crisp and clear and some nice black and white footage of the early stuff.The bad: Why does there have to be audio commentary over the music? I want to see the song in it's entirety, not with a bunch of pointless talking over it. You want an audio commentary? Fine. Offer it as an option to be turned on or off through the menu, but don't ruin the songs and performances with it. In this case, it's the first version of Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen (and this is the ""classic"" band lineup). There is hardly any footage out there of this era of Santana and to ruin it by cutting in with audio is sacrilegious. What's worse is the copy of the DVD I have has some audio dropouts. I can't tell if it's inherent to the original recording (could be since this is old footage) or if it is a defect with the DVD. Finally, the worst thing is that they take footage of Santana from different shows and splice it into one video of BMW/GQ and the editing is horrible. They don't even try to smooth the edits and the mix jumps from acceptable to bad depending on the show plus it's jarring to see clean footage followed by rawer footage. I could have lived with that IF they had used one audio take of the songs instead of different ones. This alone is enough to take away two stars.Maybe one day the record companies will try and do a better job of restoring old footage (it can be done, look at the Led Zep DVD)and presenting a better quality product. This is not one of those times and once again, they have slapped something together and rushed it out with no forethought to quality. I had to give it three stars though just because there is no other old footage commercially available. Just be warned that there are problems with the DVD.",3,Record company blows it again,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,1937,"['good', 'nice', 'have', 'older', 'footage', 'Santana', 'nothing', 'else', 'available', '70', 'cool', 'see', 'Gregg', 'Rolie', 'Neal', 'Schon', 'pre-Journey', 'days', 'footage', 'really', 'crisp', 'clear', 'nice', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'early', 'stuff.The', 'bad', 'Why', 'there', 'have', 'be', 'audio', 'commentary', 'music', 'want', 'see', 'song', 'entirety', 'not', 'bunch', 'pointless', 'talking', 'want', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Fine', 'Offer', 'option', 'be', 'turned', 'menu', 'do', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'songs', 'performances', 'case', 'first', 'version', 'Black', 'Magic', 'Woman/Gypsy', 'Queen', 'classic', 'band', 'lineup', 'hardly', 'footage', 'there', 'era', 'Santana', 'ruin', 'cutting', 'audio', 'sacrilegious', 'What', 'worse', 'copy', 'DVD', 'have', 'audio', 'dropouts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'inherent', 'original', 'recording', 'could', 'be', 'old', 'footage', 'defect', 'DVD', 'Finally', 'worst', 'thing', 'take', 'footage', 'Santana', 'different', 'shows', 'splice', 'one', 'video', 'BMW/GQ', 'editing', 'horrible', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'smooth', 'edits', 'mix', 'jumps', 'acceptable', 'bad', 'depending', 'show', 'jarring', 'see', 'clean', 'footage', 'followed', 'rawer', 'footage', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'IF', 'had', 'used', 'one', 'audio', 'take', 'songs', 'instead', 'different', 'ones', 'alone', 'enough', 'take', 'away', 'two', 'stars.Maybe', 'one', 'day', 'record', 'companies', 'will', 'try', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'restoring', 'old', 'footage', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'look', 'Led', 'Zep', 'DVD', 'presenting', 'better', 'quality', 'product', 'not', 'one', 'times', 'once', 'again', 'have', 'slapped', 'something', 'together', 'rushed', 'out', 'forethought', 'quality', 'had', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'though', 'just', 'other', 'old', 'footage', 'commercially', 'available', 'Just', 'be', 'warned', 'are', 'problems', 'DVD']",N/A

1011286,ARMVMKO557G3V,B000H7JCJ6,PETER XUEREB,"[1, 1]","The original VHS was released as a tie-in to the Double CD/LP of the same name which gave us a great overview of Santana's career complete with a Band ""family tree"" in the CD booklet. Unfortunately that is where the similarity ends.I own this on VHS and had found the audio from Carlos Santana hard to understand though it includes some great performance footage. I've not seen that VHS for quite some time & I recently bought the DVD version. However I had forgotten that Carlos talks over most of the songs and unfortunately Columbia appear to have just done a straight VHS to DVD transfer. The commentary is again hard to decipher so I recommend the use of subtitles. However it's ironic that Carlos spends a lot of time self indulgently talking about how much his playing and music means to him over the many video clips of some really great playing, when all I wanted to hear and see is THAT very same playing unencumbered by undecipherable and at times waffling commentary.  The only exception is the amazing ""Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen"" clip in California, 1985 during a massive thunder storm.I don't deny that Carlos has some interesting things to say about his influences etc., when he can be understood. However I've always thought that Carlos' guitar playing (up until the ""Shaman"" album at least) spoke for itself.It's a pity that Columbia couldn't have re-edited this release, maybe interpersing Carlos' comments BETWEEN the songs or as another reviewer suggested have a choice of Carlos' commentary on/off.  As it is one can hear the music under the dialogue but it's not really satisfying and it's hard to get into which is annoying given the actual high quality, energy and excitement of the performances, especially ""Soul Sacrifice"" at Woodstock in 1969 & ""Europa"" in France 1976.  Even the song selection menu just gives us the same songs with audio commentary.Also contrary to a previous review, this DVD doesn't provide much of a career overview of Santana which would have also been handy. It's just a collection of live performances and film clips in roughly chronological order.  The 3 stars are for the quality of the clips and what they would have been without the voice-over dialogue.  It's a badly missed opportunity.",3,A Frustrating Missed Opportunity,1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,2247,"['original', 'VHS', 'was', 'released', 'tie-in', 'Double', 'CD/LP', 'same', 'name', 'gave', 'great', 'overview', 'Santana', 'career', 'complete', 'Band', 'family', 'tree', 'CD', 'booklet', 'Unfortunately', 'where', 'similarity', 'ends.I', 'own', 'VHS', 'had', 'found', 'audio', 'Carlos', 'Santana', 'hard', 'understand', 'great', 'performance', 'footage', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'VHS', 'quite', 'time', 'recently', 'bought', 'DVD', 'version', 'However', 'had', 'forgotten', 'Carlos', 'talks', 'most', 'songs', 'unfortunately', 'Columbia', 'appear', 'have', 'just', 'done', 'straight', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'commentary', 'again', 'hard', 'decipher', 'so', 'recommend', 'use', 'subtitles', 'However', 'ironic', 'Carlos', 'lot', 'time', 'indulgently', 'talking', 'how', 'much', 'playing', 'music', 'means', 'many', 'video', 'clips', 'really', 'great', 'playing', 'when', 'wanted', 'hear', 'see', 'very', 'same', 'playing', 'unencumbered', 'undecipherable', 'times', 'waffling', 'commentary', 'only', 'exception', 'amazing', 'Black', 'Magic', 'Woman/Gypsy', 'Queen', 'clip', 'California', '1985', 'massive', 'thunder', 'storm.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'deny', 'Carlos', 'interesting', 'things', 'say', 'influences', 'etc.', 'when', 'can', 'be', 'understood', 'However', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'Carlos', 'guitar', 'playing', 'Shaman', 'album', 'least', 'spoke', 'itself.It', 'pity', 'Columbia', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 're-edited', 'release', 'maybe', 'interpersing', 'Carlos', 'comments', 'songs', 'reviewer', 'suggested', 'have', 'choice', 'Carlos', 'commentary', 'on/off', 'one', 'can', 'hear', 'music', 'dialogue', 'not', 'really', 'satisfying', 'hard', 'get', 'annoying', 'given', 'actual', 'high', 'quality', 'energy', 'excitement', 'performances', 'especially', 'Soul', 'Sacrifice', 'Woodstock', '1969', 'Europa', 'France', '1976', 'Even', 'song', 'selection', 'menu', 'just', 'same', 'songs', 'audio', 'commentary.Also', 'contrary', 'previous', 'review', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'provide', 'much', 'career', 'overview', 'Santana', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'handy', 'just', 'collection', 'live', 'performances', 'film', 'clips', 'roughly', 'chronological', 'order', '3', 'stars', 'are', 'quality', 'clips', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'voice-over', 'dialogue', 'badly', 'missed', 'opportunity']",N/A
