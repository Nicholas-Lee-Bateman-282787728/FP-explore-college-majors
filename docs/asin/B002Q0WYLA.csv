Among the humorous thread that runs throughout the movie are moments of intense drama when one festival goes horribly wrong. And moments of sadness, especially in the scene where the director's lovely wife is interviewed followed by a heart-wrenching narration.Make sure to get the Rejection Collection Edition.

And having worked the fest circuit with two features now, I can say this film rings so true that's it's almost painful to watch in places (and I mean that in a good way).This is the indie filmmaker's life, this is our humiliation, this is our reward, this is our freakin' angst!  OFFICIAL REJECTION plays like the film companion to Chris Gore's Film Festival Guide.  It covers the life (and sometimes death) of mainly one feature as it aims for Sundance, then reevaluates.  As it aims for Slamdamn, then reevaluates.  As it aims for SXSW, then...well you get the picture.  And it's not all doom and gloom.  (Well, ok, there is a film fest meltdown that has to be one of the most uncomfortable moments I've ever seen on film.)  But...there is a (somewhat) happy ending here.If you have any plans to make a film, watch this movie!  Learn from it.  These are the rules of film festivals.  Realize that you will not be the exception.I love OFFICIAL REJECTION.  It is my life.

They all tell you they love it, and you're convinced it's your calling card to film world fame.  First, of course, you've got to get the word out and the way to do that, usually, is to let it play the festival route.  Submit to Sundance, of course, and Slamdance, second best, and after that there's hundreds of others all too happy to take your entrance fee before giving a cursory look at your baby.  The problem is it's a buyer's market.  You and several thousand others are competing for the same slots at the same festivals.  So the chances you'll get in where you want are slim, even if you really have something good.""Official Rejection"" leads you through the process, step by step, as the filmmakers put together their passion project and got rejected from all but a few minor festivals that didn't have the clout to seriously spread the word about their film.  It's a sad story - and sometimes sounds like sour grapes when they insinuate a bit too strongly that the reason they didn't get in is that those who did must have done something illicit.  I'm not convinced, based on what they showed of their film, that it is the kind of film that would make an easy fit at Sundance, and there's a good explanation within the film why it didn't get in to Slamdance.  Sure, sometimes connections make a difference - and I don't see any way around that.  I know, however, a large number of filmmakers who got their projects seen at Sundance and swear it was a complete surprise and that all they did was apply.Still, that's not the focus of the doc and where it's valuable is that it provides a quick and amusing and informative look at the festival experience, a poorly understood put pivotal side of independent filmmaking.  Chris Gore (author ofChris Gore's Ultimate Film Festival Survival Guide) is featured prominently in the interviews, and there are sound bites from lots of other filmmakers, both known and unknown.  This would be a nice companion toIndependent's Day, which focuses on filmmakers who ""made it in"" to Sundance and on the creation of Slamdance as an alternative.",3,An amusing and informative (but a bit bitter) look at a poorly understood side of the independent film world,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,2202,"['decided', 'risk', 'make', 'independent', 'film', 'credit', 'cards', 'cash', 'advances', 'loved', 'ones', 'tell', 'love', ""'re"", 'convinced', 'calling', 'card', 'film', 'world', 'fame', 'First', 'course', ""'ve"", 'got', 'get', 'word', 'way', 'do', 'usually', 'let', 'play', 'festival', 'route', 'Submit', 'Sundance', 'course', 'Slamdance', 'second', 'best', 'hundreds', 'others', 'too', 'happy', 'take', 'entrance', 'fee', 'giving', 'cursory', 'look', 'baby', 'problem', 'buyer', 'market', 'several', 'thousand', 'others', 'are', 'competing', 'same', 'slots', 'same', 'festivals', 'chances', ""'ll"", 'get', 'where', 'want', 'are', 'slim', 'even', 'really', 'have', 'something', 'good', 'Official', 'Rejection', 'process', 'step', 'step', 'filmmakers', 'put', 'together', 'passion', 'project', 'got', 'rejected', 'few', 'minor', 'festivals', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clout', 'seriously', 'spread', 'word', 'film', 'sad', 'story', 'sometimes', 'sounds', 'sour', 'grapes', 'when', 'insinuate', 'bit', 'too', 'strongly', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'who', 'did', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'illicit', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'based', 'what', 'showed', 'film', 'kind', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'easy', 'fit', 'Sundance', 'good', 'explanation', 'film', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Slamdance', 'Sure', 'sometimes', 'connections', 'make', 'difference', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'know', 'however', 'large', 'number', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'got', 'projects', 'seen', 'Sundance', 'swear', 'was', 'complete', 'surprise', 'did', 'was', 'apply.Still', 'not', 'focus', 'doc', 'where', 'valuable', 'quick', 'amusing', 'informative', 'look', 'festival', 'experience', 'poorly', 'understood', 'put', 'pivotal', 'side', 'independent', 'filmmaking', 'Chris', 'Gore', 'author', 'Gore', 'Ultimate', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Survival', 'Guide', 'featured', 'prominently', 'interviews', 'are', 'sound', 'bites', 'lots', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'known', 'unknown', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'companion', 'toIndependent', 'Day', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'made', 'Sundance', 'creation', 'Slamdance', 'alternative']",N/A
