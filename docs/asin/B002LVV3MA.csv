Lees,"[57, 60]","My children greatly enjoyed Episode Three in the ongoing saga of Ice Age and indeed it is probably the best so far, being funny and clever and very tight. There is plenty of visual humor, verbal humor, and situational humor and very little is over-played (though the birthing scene comes close to being working the joke too much). So the movie itself is a great addition to the family's DVD or BluRay collection.  But this particular DVD double-pack is a shameless confidence trick.  The ScratPack disc is utterly without merit. There are no new animated sequences and most of it is tedious in the extreme. It looks as if it took someone eight minutes to compile, though that might be exaggerating the effort and thought that went into it.  There is absolutely no reason for anyone to buy this double-pack; just go for the movie alone.",3,"Great movie, terrible value",1256860800,"10 30, 2009",2009,835,"['children', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'Episode', 'Three', 'ongoing', 'saga', 'Ice', 'Age', 'indeed', 'probably', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'being', 'funny', 'clever', 'very', 'tight', 'plenty', 'visual', 'humor', 'verbal', 'humor', 'situational', 'humor', 'very', 'little', 'over-played', 'birthing', 'scene', 'close', 'being', 'working', 'joke', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'great', 'addition', 'family', 'DVD', 'BluRay', 'collection', 'particular', 'DVD', 'double-pack', 'shameless', 'confidence', 'trick', 'ScratPack', 'disc', 'utterly', 'merit', 'are', 'new', 'animated', 'sequences', 'most', 'tedious', 'extreme', 'took', 'someone', 'eight', 'minutes', 'compile', 'might', 'be', 'exaggerating', 'effort', 'thought', 'went', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'anyone', 'buy', 'double-pack', 'just', 'go', 'movie', 'alone']",Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs + The Scrat Pack

Ellie is pregnant in this one, causing the friends to step away from the growing family in an attempt to give them space.  Sid soon finds three eggs that he decides our his new children, bringing more laughs and baby dinos.  As they wreak havoc amoungst their baby peers, their real mom comes to get them back, taking Sid with them.  Now his friends have to go to a whole new world, undiscovered under layers of ice, to bring him back.  The mammoths quickly realize they aren't the biggest ones in the world anymore, and they all meet a koooky, crazy weasel who aids them on their way.
