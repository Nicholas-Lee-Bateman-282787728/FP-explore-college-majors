328398,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6302703816,Annie Van Auken,"[6, 6]","THE PUBLIC EYE (1992) is set in September of 1942. It stars Joe Pesci as nickel cigar-chewing Leon Bernstein-- a ""shutterbug"" or free-lance photo-journalist nicknamed 'The Great Bernzini.'Bernzy' is not above rearranging crime scenes for a better picture. He'll reposition a corpse, make sure it has a hat on, and so forth. He's also a master at obtaining ""impossible"" shots. Example: a male domestic violence victim being removed from his apartment is covered with a white sheet so that no one can photograph the axe buried in his forehead. Disguised as a priest, Bernzy finagles his way into the ambulance and fakes administering the Last Rites. He then takes a couple of quick snaps with a mini-35 mm camera and is immediately bounced out the vehicle's back door.Classic noir elements include shadowy night scenes, a pervasively dark mood and especially Bernzy's involvement with glamorous nightclub owner Kay Levitz (Barbara Hershey), who seemingly befriends this lonely man but ultimately uses him for her own ends. The story (and their brief affair) ends sadly, in classic noir fashion.This somber film is punctuated with a high-power gangland execution of an entire mob that occurs at a small family-style Italian restaurant. Bernzy bravely positions himself in a backroom to photograph these killings as they happen, and when one mobster sees and points a pistol at him, Bernzy responds by taking his picture!Re-creation of the '40s is outstanding throughout and Pesci's atypically understated, soulful acting marks what I believe is his very best screen performance. Due to its bloody moments, this one never could have been made in the '40s. Even so, all fans of film noir will find THE PUBLIC EYE highly satisfying. I heartily recommend it.",5,"Leon 'Bernzy' Bernstein: ""Nobody does what I do.

This says a lot more about the movie business than it does about him. Actually, his violent roles, despite his hard-boiled persona and his ability to convincingly explode on screen, remain a tiny bit unconvincing. One reason for this is that he is not physically imposing. Also he can't stop being just a wee bit cute, like a squirrel with a machine gun. The role of Wee Gee, the persistent little cameraman who documented New York's dark underbelly, therefore, is tailor-made for Pesci. Employing a vulnerability alongside his trademark streetwise persona, he gives an affecting portrayal in a film that also seems a masterly and gritty recreation of 1940s New York (Having no first-hand experience, I can't really say for sure). The movie's one fault, however, is that a photographer is just a photographer and is not a suitable subject of apotheosis, as is attempted at the finale.",4,The Perfect Role for a Small Tough Guy,985478400,"03 25, 2001",2001,982,"['Joe', 'Pesci', 'usually', 'up', 'playing', 'tough', 'often', 'brutal', 'sometimes', 'incredibly', 'violent', 'mobsters', 'lot', 'more', 'movie', 'business', 'Actually', 'violent', 'roles', 'hard-boiled', 'persona', 'ability', 'convincingly', 'explode', 'screen', 'remain', 'tiny', 'bit', 'unconvincing', 'One', 'reason', 'not', 'physically', 'imposing', 'Also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'just', 'wee', 'bit', 'cute', 'squirrel', 'machine', 'gun', 'role', 'Wee', 'Gee', 'persistent', 'little', 'cameraman', 'who', 'documented', 'New', 'York', 'dark', 'underbelly', 'therefore', 'tailor-made', 'Pesci', 'Employing', 'vulnerability', 'trademark', 'streetwise', 'persona', 'affecting', 'portrayal', 'film', 'also', 'masterly', 'gritty', 'recreation', '1940s', 'New', 'York', 'Having', 'first-hand', 'experience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'sure', 'movie', 'one', 'fault', 'however', 'photographer', 'just', 'photographer', 'not', 'suitable', 'subject', 'apotheosis', 'attempted', 'finale']",N/A

There's something intriguing about this story that drives me back to it time and again.Perhaps that is so because it's about a photographer, something I did, too, while being in the newspaper business for years and an art form I've always enjoyed. The story also takes place in the 1940s and I love the style and atmosphere of that era which is beautifully shown here.Joe Pesci is Leon Bernzini or ""The Great Bernzini,"" a newspaper photographer, and Barbara Hershey is a mysterious woman who Pesci has the hots for. There is a lot of mystery in here with Hershey's character.Sad to say, the filmmakers kind of make a hero out of basically a sleazy guy who has few, if any, morals. (""Bernzy"" was ""paparazzi"" before they invented the word!).

328402,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6302703816,David Baldwin,"[0, 0]","Being an undertaker is a necessary evil.  Laws have been passed against prostitution but despite the legal roadblocks thrown it's way it still thrives.  Leon ""Bernzie"" Bernstein's(Joe Pesci) tabloid photography falls somewhere in that gray area.  The public clamors for the sensational images that emanate from his camera but he has to pick up his meager checks discretely at the back door.  Bernstein views what he does as a public service and to his mind his urban nocturnal images are a philanthropic enterprise.  If ""The Public Eye"" were merely a character study I would give it five stars.  Unfortunately it's saddled with an unwieldy script about the mob being in cahoots with the feds.  The mob in turn is muscling a female nightclub owner(Barbara Hershey) who turns to Bernstein for help both professionally and romantically.  This plot is so byzantine that it nearly scuttles the film.  That said there is so much to recommend that this film isn't a lost cause.  Pesci is terrific in one of his rare starring roles expertly imbuing his character with depth and empathy for the brickbats he has to endure.  Hershey looks ravishing recalling the screen sirens of the early Forties that the film is trying to evoke.  Richard Harris' son, Jared, gets your attention as Hershey's loyal doorman.  It also doesn't hurt to have a couple ""Sopranos"" vets, Domenic Chianese and Jerry Adler, on hand.  The film also looks terrific evoking wartime New York magnificently.

328407,AB4MB7S796GNJ,6302703816,Larkenfield,"[8, 9]","I have enjoyed this movie more times than I can remember. Joe Pesci is perfect as the scrappy tabloid photographer who at heart feels that what he is doing is also an ART. The film is about vindicating himself as an artist and reclaiming his personal life as a man, after sacrificing so much because he is driven to capture the ultimate picture in his work and living for so long seemingly as a bum. Anyone who is an artist or creative type is likely to get a great deal of enjoyment out of this unusual story where the main characters come from two completely different backgrounds and yet are irresistibly drawn together. The relationship between Pesci and Barbara Hershey is compelling and has many unexpected twists and turns: there's always some suspicion going on between them that complicates their relationship way out of the ordinary, even though there's a love here and they want to trust each other.Please... will some big-shot movie exec please get this classic out on DVD? I agree with another reviewer that this is one of Pesci's best roles: he's gritty and determined without having to play a twisted figure from the underworld - the role was perfect for him. I love character and plot driven films and I've always felt that this gem delivers on both counts. Plus, the feeling of the war years during the 1940s is captured to a T. I bet I've seen it at least 50 times, including because of Mark Isham's understated soundtrack that sets the perfect mood. (I own the soundtrack too... one of my all-time favorites!)

SO THE WHOLE FILM IS HERE...but it is subtely squeezed.I have attached captures here for those of you wishing to see what i mean.The laser disc is the one of poorer quality and the black bars are thicker...the DVD is much, much cleaner, and the looks like there are no black bars(but there are).more importantly, one both pictures, the side of the frame information is the same at the given point of pause (just as the license plate of the vehicle lower left enters the frame fully).You will also see that the DVD is a bit squeezed in comparison to the LaserdiscSo, given that we do have the who of the picture, i have to say i'm pleased with this presentationIt played back easily on my Bluray player, my PC, and as well as my laptop.Stereo Presentation is stellar...that was the original sound tract as well.While there was the FBI Warning screen, there are no special features, trailers, or Disc Menu or splash screensThe disc is divided into 10 chapters though.Lastly, on all my players, interestingly enough, it registers as a DVD and not a DVD-R as I anticipated.  Fine by me. It works perfectly.Worth the $20? Yes, but only because I'm unloading my laserdisc collection; if a full DVD w/ special features and extras were available - no; let alone Blurayhope this helps",5,Almost perfect!,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,2225,"['review', 'quality', 'fot', 'Universal', 'Vault', 'Series', 'presentation', 'Public', 'Eye', '.The', 'question', 'want', 'answer', '20.Here', 'are', 'facts', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', '192Kbps', '/', 'MPEG2', '5.58Mbps', '/', '29.97fps', '480x720', 'Region', 'coded', ':1Widescreen', 'Enhanced', '16x9', 'TV1.85:1Video', 'Quality', '3.90', '[', 'Bluray', '=5', '/', 'Top', 'DVD', '=4', '/', 'Laserdisc', '=3', '/', 'VCD=2', '/', 'VHS', '=1', ']', 'only', 'thing', 'reaching', '4', 'star', 'film', 'grain', 'very', 'apparent', 'not', 'bothersomeSome', 'will', 'be', 'concerned', 'Laserdisc', 'Original', 'Film', 'presentation', 'were', '2:35:1', 'whereas', 'MCA', 'Universal', 'decided', 'release', '1.85:1.Actually', 'original', 'recording', 'process', 'used', 'Super35', 'anamorphic', 'squeezed', '2.35:1', 'presentation', '35mm', 'film.It', 'was', 'unsqueezed', 'theater.Interestingly', 'when', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'Laserdisc', 'i', 'find', 'actuality', 'MCA/U', 'simply', 'unsqueezed', 'just', 'enough', 'fit', '1.85:1', 'window', 'THE', 'WHOLE', 'FILM', 'IS', 'HERE', 'subtely', 'squeezed.I', 'have', 'attached', 'captures', 'here', 'wishing', 'see', 'what', 'i', 'mean.The', 'laser', 'disc', 'one', 'poorer', 'quality', 'black', 'bars', 'are', 'thicker', 'DVD', 'much', 'much', 'cleaner', 'looks', 'are', 'black', 'bars', 'are', '.more', 'importantly', 'one', 'pictures', 'side', 'frame', 'information', 'same', 'given', 'point', 'pause', 'just', 'license', 'plate', 'vehicle', 'lower', 'left', 'frame', 'fully', '.You', 'will', 'also', 'see', 'DVD', 'bit', 'squeezed', 'comparison', 'LaserdiscSo', 'given', 'do', 'have', 'who', 'picture', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'i', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'presentationIt', 'played', 'back', 'easily', 'Bluray', 'player', 'PC', 'as', 'well', 'laptop.Stereo', 'Presentation', 'stellar', 'was', 'original', 'sound', 'tract', 'well.While', 'was', 'FBI', 'Warning', 'screen', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'trailers', 'Disc', 'Menu', 'splash', 'screensThe', 'disc', 'divided', '10', 'chapters', 'though.Lastly', 'players', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'DVD', 'not', 'DVD-R', 'anticipated', 'Fine', '20', 'Yes', 'only', ""'m"", 'unloading', 'laserdisc', 'collection', 'full', 'DVD', 'w/', 'special', 'features', 'extras', 'were', 'available', 'let', 'alone', 'Blurayhope', 'helps']",N/A

I mean, would it be too much trouble for the site where it's actually being sold to give us some information that is normally listed on the rear cover of a DVD, but since we (as customers) don't have the privilege of actually inspecting this item in a store for ourselves, must rely on the what info we're given by an internet site?  I hate these on-demand discs--Netflix won't carry them because some members have trouble playing DVD-Rs so the rest of us have to suffer and can't even rent them. And twenty bucks for this crap?! (I'm not saying any of the films themselves are crap, just the way they're being released.) I thought the whole reason for this marketing ploy was to cut costs...so then why are we as customers being gouged by having to pay $20 for bare-bones, low-quality discs?
