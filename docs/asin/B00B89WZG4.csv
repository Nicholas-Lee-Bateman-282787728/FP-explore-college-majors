1623213,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B00B89WZG4,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[34, 35]","3 1/2 stars.This mistery opens with an intoxicated gentleman who is helped into a horse drawn cab, or ""Hansom Cab"", by another, younger gentleman.  The young man coming to his aid realizes after the fact that the drunk is his sleazy romantic rival.  The drunk man in the cab is later found murdered with an obvious implication against his younger rival.  The first part of the movie deals mainly with solving the murder mystery and seems a bit slow.  However, this is not the ultimate mystery.  Several more riddles will be introduced with engaging outcomes.  At the center is Madge, the love interest of the accused and heiress to a powerful father.  What is her father's secret?  What could it have to do with the charming and innocent Madge? How far would the young, self made, Irish man go to protect Madge from his sleazy rival?Hang with this movie and it will reward you.  The filming isn't as polished as some period dramas we are used to.  However, it is certainly on a par with, or better than, older BBC productions.  This film is more recent so I mentioned that just for comparison. I found it a nice change for an Australian entry into the genre.  The acting is very well done and the actress who plays Madge is wonderful.

At first I was a little miffed with the accused murderer, I thought, are you nuts, just tell them but if you remember all you've read and heard of the morals and ideas back in victorian times it makes sense.
