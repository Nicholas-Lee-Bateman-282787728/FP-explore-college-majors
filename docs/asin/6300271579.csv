Not confused in the sense that I couldn't follow the story, but confused in the sense that I didn't know what to think of it. My initial reaction was to simply dismiss it.It's a well photographed film with a strong, distinctive look. The performances are strong, but when I went to examine what exactly it was that I took from watching the film, I couldn't really think of much. However, as time went by, I just couldn't quite shake it. It was one of those films that lingered on my mind afterwards. So I thought, maybe my initial reaction was unfair.Looking at it a second time, I found the idea of how all these people's lives are interconnected by one random person (that all of them barely know) and how that one person has a domino effect on everyone they meet to be quite intriguing. The notion that someone you barely know, could affect your life so profusely, so negatively is quite frightening, quite powerful, quite tangible.Reexamining Mike's Murder, the more I appreciated all the various nuances and complexities that were brimming just beneath the surface and the more I took from it each time I watched it. Mike's Murder isn't an easily accessible film, but I think the best films aren't always easy and they challenge you in unexpected ways. With Mike's Murder, there are so many different layers, so many different things to pick apart. It's the kind of entertainment that is endlessly fascinating.

Not to mention the debacle around its 1984 production when the MBA's at Warner made Bridges recut and trim down the violence because some yuppies girls sniffing nosecandy in a Walnut Creek bathroom during screening broke down crying saying things like &quot;How do they expect us to go on after seeing this?!!!&quot; They told Bridges they would not release his film unless he made the young cokeheads feel more safe, so he spent $200,000 to recut and reshoot portions of the (still) remarkable film so that he could give it to us, then, darn it, he up and died a few years later!!!Anyway, this film has a GREAT score by JOHN BARRY with additional songs by then famous Joe Jackson.It is an accurate a picture of the seediness of amoral 'I will kill you for money' vibe in L.A. as anything I have ever seen.There are stellar performances throughout. Winger is simply the best of the 80s here.  Mark Keyloun (what happened to him???) shines as goofy, loveable, stupid Mike.The cinematography (like Body Double of the same year, methinks) captures the numbing glare and seductive light of Los Angeles, the sense of ALWAYS BEING IN A CAR or ON A PHONE and rarely having any direct contact with the people you desire most (isn't that what fuels that place, though?).Cannot recommend this thriller/character study enough for anyone who enjoys a peek at how the uninitated get destroyed, and how places like L.A. destroy them.Oh yeah, this film bravely slams everyone equally.

The negativity might be a result of all the rumored problems this film encountered post-production, as it was taken from the director and essentially re-cut. Apparently, it was originally designed to run backwards chronologically, but was pulled after poor test showings and re-edited in to this more conventional format. Regardless, in this released version it plays just fine. However, it would also be fascinating if it were ever cut as to its original intent. Although writer/director James Bridges passed-away in 1993, perhaps some enterprising outfit like Criterion might one-day offer a ""Director's Cut"" so that we might be able to enjoy this as it was meant to be shown (there are several tantalizing scenes in the original trailer that's available via IMDb).",3,Why all the vitriol?,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,967,"['solid', 'gripping', 'thriller', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'seamy', 'ugly', 'side', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'drug', 'culture', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'why', 'been', 'routinely', 'trashed', 'many', 'reviews', 'negativity', 'might', 'be', 'result', 'rumored', 'problems', 'film', 'encountered', 'post-production', 'was', 'taken', 'director', 'essentially', 're-cut', 'Apparently', 'was', 'originally', 'designed', 'run', 'backwards', 'chronologically', 'was', 'pulled', 'poor', 'test', 'showings', 're-edited', 'more', 'conventional', 'format', 'Regardless', 'released', 'version', 'just', 'fine', 'However', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'fascinating', 'were', 'ever', 'cut', 'original', 'intent', 'writer/director', 'James', 'Bridges', 'passed-away', '1993', 'perhaps', 'enterprising', 'outfit', 'Criterion', 'might', 'one-day', 'offer', 'Director', 'Cut', 'so', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'shown', 'are', 'several', 'tantalizing', 'scenes', 'original', 'trailer', 'available', 'IMDb']",Mike's Murder VHS
