570688,A1DI3PU62K8KZ0,B000056T4F,Duchess Darcy,"[56, 57]","Somewhere I read that a viewer rated this movie as having 10 stars, in part because of what it was about, but mostly because of how it made them feel. And how does it make me feel, like I am thirteen all over again. As Jesse puts it, NICE! This little gem of a movie has stayed with me for years and I surprise myself on how much of it I remember. I only saw it once 26 years ago and I still remember it as though I saw it yesterday.I have read from other comments that it was viewed as a afternoon school special in 1979. But I recall that it was shown on prime time the year before. One of those movie of the week things. I had kept, for almost 10 years, the t.v. guide clipping of the film so I know the year of the original release was 1978. On the clipping, Michael's age was written down as 19, not 17. I don't know if that was a T.V. guide error or if it was the original age his character was suppose to be and they later changed it because the age difference was larger. Sadly, the clipping is long gone, having been discarded a few years after college when I cleared my stuff from my parents place.Watching the film again brought me back to the end of eight grade when I first saw it. Being the same age as Jesse in the movie, I was just months away from turning 14. Unlike the movies, I wasn't lucky enough to get a gorgeous, rock star, boyfriend, but it was and still is fun to see how Jesse got hers. It's a rare film that lasts through the years and changing times and still packs an emotional wallop. The message remains the same. Your first love, will always be the sweetest, most fondly remembered moment.I just ordered the DVD of the movie, as well as the three books (Sooner or Later, Waiting Games, Now or Never) since I only discovered they are now available. I read from other viewer comments that the third book ends abruptly, leaving the door open for a fourth book? Seems the story of Michael and Jesse is not yet over. I hope Bruce and Carole Hart will heed our plea and conclude the Michael and Jesse story with a happy send off.The songs were wonderful, &quot;Simply Jesse&quot; being my favorite with &quot;You take my Breath Away&quot; a very close second. It's a film you can watch again and again. Though dated, it's appeal is still strong. A nice glance back to our teenage years during the late seventies, early eighties, when Shaun Cassidy was the latest hottie, station wagons ruled the roads, and feathered hair was the look to die for.",5,NICE.....!,1078704000,"03 8, 2004",2004,2473,"['Somewhere', 'read', 'viewer', 'rated', 'movie', 'having', '10', 'stars', 'part', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'mostly', 'how', 'made', 'feel', 'how', 'make', 'feel', 'am', 'thirteen', 'over', 'again', 'Jesse', 'NICE', 'little', 'gem', 'movie', 'stayed', 'years', 'surprise', 'how', 'much', 'remember', 'only', 'saw', 'once', '26', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'remember', 'saw', 'yesterday.I', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'comments', 'was', 'viewed', 'afternoon', 'school', 'special', '1979', 'recall', 'was', 'shown', 'prime', 'time', 'year', 'before', 'One', 'movie', 'week', 'things', 'had', 'kept', 'almost', '10', 'years', 't.v', 'guide', 'clipping', 'film', 'so', 'know', 'year', 'original', 'release', 'was', '1978', 'clipping', 'Michael', 'age', 'was', 'written', 'down', '19', 'not', '17', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'T.V', 'guide', 'error', 'was', 'original', 'age', 'character', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'later', 'changed', 'age', 'difference', 'was', 'larger', 'Sadly', 'clipping', 'long', 'gone', 'having', 'been', 'discarded', 'few', 'years', 'college', 'when', 'cleared', 'stuff', 'parents', 'place.Watching', 'film', 'again', 'brought', 'back', 'end', 'eight', 'grade', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Being', 'same', 'age', 'Jesse', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'months', 'away', 'turning', '14', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'lucky', 'enough', 'get', 'gorgeous', 'rock', 'star', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'Jesse', 'got', 'hers', 'rare', 'film', 'years', 'changing', 'times', 'still', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'message', 'same', 'first', 'love', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'sweetest', 'most', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'moment.I', 'just', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'books', 'Sooner', 'Later', 'Waiting', 'Games', 'Now', 'Never', 'only', 'discovered', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'read', 'other', 'viewer', 'comments', 'third', 'book', 'abruptly', 'leaving', 'door', 'open', 'fourth', 'book', 'story', 'Michael', 'Jesse', 'not', 'yet', 'hope', 'Bruce', 'Carole', 'Hart', 'will', 'heed', 'plea', 'conclude', 'Michael', 'Jesse', 'story', 'happy', 'send', 'off.The', 'songs', 'were', 'wonderful', 'quot', 'Simply', 'Jesse', 'quot', 'being', 'favorite', 'quot', 'take', 'Breath', 'Away', 'quot', 'very', 'close', 'second', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'dated', 'appeal', 'still', 'strong', 'nice', 'glance', 'back', 'teenage', 'years', 'late', 'seventies', 'early', 'eighties', 'when', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'was', 'latest', 'hottie', 'station', 'wagons', 'ruled', 'roads', 'feathered', 'hair', 'was', 'look', 'die']",N/A

I never got to see it on t.v., and had rented it several times a few years ago. Then it disappeared from the video store.  I have been a big fan of Rex Smith since I was 9 years old, and he is just so sexy and talented in this movie.  It's his showcase.  He has an amazing singing voice, and is such a charming actor.  He really brings Michael Skye to life!!  All the other actors in this film are great too.  It's a romance/comedy/drama about a teenager, Jessie. She's thirteen, and falls in love with Michael Skye(who wouldn't?).  She tells him alot of lies to be with him.  This is a very endearing film and it has stood the test of time.  I don't know if the guys will like it, but ladies...you will enjoy this movie!! Whether you are 13 or 31!!! Watch it and see how it turns out.  You'll also get to hear Rex Smith perform, and I think the songs are great.  Very catchy tunes.  Hopefully they will put it on CD as my old LP is very scratched!!!

Rex Smith of course was handsome,talented and gallant, and Jesse was ""every girl"" who wanted to be with the cool guy. At the time I thought the ending was perfect and I wondered if Michael and Jessie could actually make their romance work into a happily-ever-after!Now as a mom with a 13-year-old of my own, I wonder what the parents were thinking?  Why were they afraid to actually talk to her about sex and boys, and what the heck was the talk Jesse and her mom had even about?I also was a bit mortified with the ending - a 17 year old boy is going to let the 13 year old make all the decisions? If she were my daughter she'd be driven to a different guitar teacher!  In retrospect I also had a lot more questions about Michael's sexuality - as a young man who doesn't date, rebuffs advances from a girl his own age, and then decides it's a good idea to date a 13 year old!The scene with Jesse and her grandmother was touching although I'm not sure it added to the plot!The music numbers were fun though.",3,Watched it now as a parent/ remembered it as a girl,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,1097,"['remember', 'watching', 'movie', 'girl', 'thinking', 'was', 'so', 'romantic', 'dreamy', 'Rex', 'Smith', 'course', 'was', 'handsome', 'talented', 'gallant', 'Jesse', 'was', 'girl', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'cool', 'guy', 'time', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'perfect', 'wondered', 'Michael', 'Jessie', 'could', 'actually', 'make', 'romance', 'work', 'happily-ever-after', 'Now', 'mom', '13-year-old', 'own', 'wonder', 'what', 'parents', 'were', 'thinking', 'Why', 'were', 'afraid', 'actually', 'talk', 'sex', 'boys', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'talk', 'Jesse', 'mom', 'had', 'even', 'also', 'was', 'bit', 'mortified', 'ending', '17', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'going', 'let', '13', 'year', 'old', 'make', 'decisions', 'were', 'daughter', ""'d"", 'be', 'driven', 'different', 'guitar', 'teacher', 'retrospect', 'also', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'questions', 'Michael', 'sexuality', 'young', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'date', 'rebuffs', 'advances', 'girl', 'own', 'age', 'then', 'good', 'idea', 'date', '13', 'year', 'old', 'scene', 'Jesse', 'grandmother', 'was', 'touching', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'added', 'plot', 'music', 'numbers', 'were', 'fun']",N/A

Completely made up as an After School Special, I remember getting lost in the story of a 13 year old girl falling in love with the older man of her dreams. While the movie has lost some of it's luster now that I see it with an adult's eyes, it remains innocent and fun to watch. I was surprised to realize that I even remembered alot of the great songs and lines from the movie as I watched it. From Jessie's make-over in the local Gimbles department store to her chocolate cake bindge over losing her love, you just have to smile. You can imagine my surprise though when I found the movie I loved as a kid was brought back and re-made into DVD. Needless to say, I immediately bought a copy on Amazon.com. And I couldn't be any happier. For those of you unfamiliar with the movie, it stared late 70s/early 80s teen idol Rex Smith.
