Part politician, part humanitarian, and part freebooter, he led Texas first to independence and then to statehood. Born in Virginia around 1795, he lived in Arkansas for awhile, becoming an adopted member of the Cherokee Tribe. He later moved to Tennessee, where he became first a Congressman and then Governor of that State. A disastrous short-term marriage ended in annullment; scandalized in the eyes of many, he left the Governor's Mansion and returned to the Cherokee Nation, where he met and married his second wife. Unhappy with his friend President Andrew Jackson's treatment of the Cherokee, he went to Washington DC to lecture Old Hickory on fairness. While he was in Washington, he got into a donnybrook with another Congressman and was tried before the House of Representatives (whose jurisdiction over him was hazy); he won an acquittal. Not long after that, he set out for the Mexican State of Texas as an American ""colonist."" (It is unknown whether Andrew Jackson sent him there to organize the Texas Rebellion, though the film tends to lean that way.) Once in Texas, Houston became the General Officer Commanding of all Texas military forces.His tenure as General was stormy. Texas' army, made up primarily of ""irregular"" American settlers, was fractious. Self-appointed Regimental officers failed to follow orders. Houston's political rivals in the Texas Government undercut his authority---one, President David Burnet relieved him of duty, but Burnet's politically-motivated orders were ignored. A good many Texans wanted to go into headlong battle against the much larger and much more well-equipped Mexican Army, regardless of the ultimate consequences. The Battle of the Alamo and the Battle of Goliad both ended with Mexican dictator Santa Anna slaughtering all the gringoes involved.As Santa Anna closed in, Houston tried desperately to weld his ragtag force into an effective army. His unwillingness to waste lives led to charges of cowardice. It was not until the Texas Army was reinforced by ""volunteers"" from the Army of the United States that Houston moved. At the Battle of San Jacinto he routed the Mexicans utterly and captured Santa Anna himself, who traded an independent Texas for his own freedom.GONE TO TEXAS only touches lightly on the obviously poisonous internal politics of Texan independence. It also touches only lightly on the bizarrely opportunistic character of Santa Anna, a tin-pot 19th Century Napoleon who was trying to control a sparsely populated nation that stretched from the 45th parallel to the 16th with police state tactics.But GONE TO TEXAS paints a far-larger-than-life portrait of Sam Houston, who is played with obvious relish by Sam Elliott, one of Hollywood's finest iconic Western actors. His luxuriant moustache, perpetual sneer, and gravelly bass add full color to his interpretation of Sam Houston. Nobody could play him better. He makes us believe that his Sam Houston IS Sam Houston.As for Houston himself, despite the odd trajectory of his life, he always managed to end up on the right side of every argument. As second and fourth President of Texas, he pushed for U.S. Statehood; afterward, he became Governor of Texas, the only man to ever have been Governor of two different States (Texas and Tennessee). In his later years, he rejected secession, remaining a staunch Union man during the Civil War, which, he prophesied, Texas would lose. Sent into political exile for his ""traitorous"" remarks and actions, and bent on keeping Texas in the Union, he died in July 1863, right after Gettysburg and Vicksburg. In retrospect, his honors were all restored, though Houston himself died thinking his life had been a failure. Obviously not so.",5,"""Remember the Alamo!
