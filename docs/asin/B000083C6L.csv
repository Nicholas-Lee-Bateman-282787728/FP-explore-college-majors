Not so with &quot;Strawberry Shortcake,&quot; but that's not a problem. Fact is, this introduction to Strawberry, little sister Apple Dumpling, friends Ginger Snap, Angel Cake, etc., and her pets Pupcake and Custard, is as sweet as the characters' names suggests, and everything is aimed at the level of the pre-gradeschool set. It shows these characters working together and solving problems even when they occasionally disagree. It also has a bouncy musical track and a music video after the end titles.OK, so the animation is the cheapo kind that the aficianado will carp about. OK, so the plot is silly and the characters one-dimensional. It reaches its audience nicely, tells a positive story, and, frankly, creates a desire for tied-in merchandise. What else is new?

We gave her this DVD for her 3rd birthday and she has watched it countless times since!This adorable DVD introduces Strawberry Shortcake and her friends to new SSC fans.  Pupcake, Custard, Ginger Snap, Angel Cake, Orange Blossom and Huckleberry Pie are introduced in this story as Strawberry goes on a hunt for treats for her sister Apple Dumpling's bday.  She meets Ginger, Angel, Orange and Huckleberry along the way.My daughter and her big brother enjoy watching this DVD with its colorful and bright visuals, bouncy songs, cheerful characters (excepting Custard, that is) and themes of friendship and helping one another.  As a parent, I give it two thumbs up!!  The only complaint I may have would be the portrayal of Custard as a grumpy, whiny little cat but at least by the end she learns to appreciate differences in others.  And why does Custard talk but Pupcake doesn't?  Anyway, my kids love the show so - my curiosity aside - in the end this is all that really matters.",4,Fun introduction to Strawberry Shortcake.......,1065657600,"10 9, 2003",2003,1088,"['daughter', 'just', 'started', 'taking', 'interest', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake', 'purchased', 'SSC', 'book', 'gave', 'DVD', '3rd', 'birthday', 'watched', 'countless', 'times', 'adorable', 'DVD', 'introduces', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake', 'friends', 'new', 'SSC', 'fans', 'Pupcake', 'Custard', 'Ginger', 'Snap', 'Angel', 'Cake', 'Orange', 'Blossom', 'Huckleberry', 'Pie', 'are', 'introduced', 'story', 'Strawberry', 'hunt', 'treats', 'sister', 'Apple', 'Dumpling', 'bday', 'Ginger', 'Angel', 'Orange', 'Huckleberry', 'way.My', 'daughter', 'big', 'brother', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'DVD', 'colorful', 'bright', 'visuals', 'bouncy', 'songs', 'cheerful', 'characters', 'excepting', 'Custard', 'themes', 'friendship', 'helping', 'one', 'parent', 'give', 'two', 'only', 'complaint', 'may', 'have', 'would', 'be', 'portrayal', 'Custard', 'grumpy', 'whiny', 'little', 'cat', 'least', 'end', 'appreciate', 'differences', 'others', 'why', 'Custard', 'talk', 'Pupcake', ""n't"", 'Anyway', 'kids', 'love', 'show', 'so', 'curiosity', 'aside', 'end', 'really', 'matters']",Strawberry Shortcake - Meet Strawberry Shortcake
