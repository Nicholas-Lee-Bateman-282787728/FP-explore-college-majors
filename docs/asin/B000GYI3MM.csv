1008359,A1BFO0O2FT0O3T,B000GYI3MM,"Chancie ""Chance""","[0, 0]","I had seen the first Butterfly Effect years ago when it first came out. I absolutely loved it, and it rose to be one of my top favorite movies. Some time later, I saw that they released this sequel. It was clearly a B-movie that slipped under the radar and had no promotions whatsoever. I wasn't convinced, and I avoided it like the plague.Just a few days ago, I found a combo pack of the two movies at the store for very cheap. I'd never owned the first one unfortunately and I couldn't beat the cheap price. Plus, I figured I'd just take a look at the sequel and maybe give it a chance. The cheap cost made buying it worth it just for the first one alone.Now, I didn't think that the Butterfly Effect 2 was the worst sequel ever made, but it wasn't good by any means. The plot feels like a remix of the first, using some of the same elements in what gets ""messed up"" when he goes back to try and fix things.None of the original actors return, so don't hold your breath for that.There is absolutely no suspense either. There is no ""climax"" in the story, nothing. It seems to go at about the same pace for the entire movie. I think it may be because of this that there's no surprises either. Everything seemed very obvious to me, and I was able to guess just about every ""turning point"" that the movie had.There was no emotional impact unlike the original, and you could not feel any emotion for either main character regardless of what happened to them. Everything that the characters do and say feels very forced, not like they are actually feeling said emotions.Despite its flaws, I sat through it until the end without thinking ""I need to just shut this off"" so I suppose did enjoy it to some degree. I'm not sure just how much (I doubt it was much), but it at least wasn't bad enough for me to turn it off.If you're skeptical, walk away, and you'll be just fine never seeing it.

In fact, in many ways, it's better than the GOOFBALL ASHTON KUTCHER version.And contrary to what a lot of these guys are saying... there is a story, and apparently this movie is being trashed on here for being DIFFERENT than the original. Well, I applaud it for that. It is different. It's about love and the conflicting things that take over our lives. Ultimately, Love is all there is, but Nick Larson (Eric Lively) lets the conflicting things, like work, friends and revenge take control of his judgement.The original BUTTERFLY EFFECT wasn't that darn good anyway. Yet, this one is better than the original, for one very important reason. ERICA DURANCE is in it. That's worth 2 stars alone, Erica Durance did something other than TV movies and Television shows like Smallville, where she plays Lois Lane. She's beautiful and sexy and I hope she keeps working, because I like watching her.No, it isn't a great, or even good movie, but it's certainly not horrible like some of these reviews lead you to believe. I enjoyed watching the film and it had some nice twists and shocking moments.

The best example of this is the thousands of direct-to-DVD sequels that litter the walls of movie rental stores across the country. Most are pale reflections of the originals.Every once in a while a sequel comes along that doesn't improve on the first one, but still manages to entertain. ""The Butterfly Effect 2"" falls into this category. It's both entertaining and thought-provoking at the same time.Warner Bros. Home Entertainment recently released it on Blu-ray for the first time. I saw ""The Butterfly Effect"" when it hit DVD a few years ago and liked it. I never got around to seeing the sequel but remained mildly interested in checking it out because it starred Erica Durance from ""Smallville."" I'm glad I had the opportunity to see it finally in high-definition.Nick, his girlfriend Julie, and their two best friends are struck by a semi on the way home from vacation. Everyone is killed but Nick, leaving him alone to deal with the aftermath of the tragedy. He discovers he has the power to travel to the past and change events in his life. Nick starts to alter reality and finds that each jump back in time isn't necessarily changing things for the better... in the present or the future.You can tell director John R. Leonetti put his blood, sweat, and tears into this movie but was limited as to what he could do because of the budget. It doesn't feel like a straight-to-DVD movie besides some of the camerawork. The wreck looks realistic and most of the time-warp scenes look decent. The special effects aren't perfect by any means but get the job done.One issue with the film is that there are points where it reminds me of a late-night Cinemax skin flick. There are some soft-core porn sequences that feel placed in the film to attract that audience base. I feel it cheapens the movie and takes the focus off of a relatively decent storyline.The high-definition transfer looks and sounds great. The picture is almost too clean and has that digital feel to it. It is distracting at points. The 5.1 surround sound mix blends the crashes, gunshots, and atmospheric soundtrack very well.Extra features include audio commentary by director John R. Leonetti and co-producer Michael Stirling. A ""Making of"" featurette entitled ""Altering Reality: On the Set of 'The Butterfly Effect 2'"" shows behind the scenes footage which makes you respect the film more. It also shows how they accomplished the crash between the semi and the SUV. An unimpressive trailer for the movie is also included.""The Butterfly Effect 2"" stands on its own and doesn't require anyone who didn't see the first film from grasping what's happening. If you're looking to upgrade your home movie collection and like these you'll want to buy this Blu-ray version. It's strictly for people who enjoyed ""The Butterfly Effect"" and couldn't get enough or those who never saw it and just happen upon this one first.",3,"Blu-ray Review: ""The Butterfly Effect 2""",1343952000,"08 3, 2012",2012,3037,"['can', 'bank', 'film', 'mild', 'success', 'theaters', 'studios', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'exploit', 'situation', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'concept', 'best', 'example', 'thousands', 'direct-to-DVD', 'sequels', 'litter', 'walls', 'movie', 'rental', 'stores', 'country', 'Most', 'are', 'pale', 'reflections', 'originals.Every', 'once', 'while', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'improve', 'first', 'one', 'still', 'entertain', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', '2', 'category', 'entertaining', 'thought-provoking', 'same', 'time.Warner', 'Bros.', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'recently', 'released', 'Blu-ray', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'when', 'hit', 'DVD', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'liked', 'never', 'got', 'seeing', 'sequel', 'remained', 'mildly', 'interested', 'checking', 'starred', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'Smallville', ""'m"", 'glad', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'finally', 'high-definition.Nick', 'girlfriend', 'Julie', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'struck', 'semi', 'way', 'home', 'vacation', 'Everyone', 'killed', 'Nick', 'leaving', 'alone', 'deal', 'aftermath', 'tragedy', 'power', 'travel', 'past', 'change', 'events', 'life', 'Nick', 'alter', 'reality', 'jump', 'back', 'time', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'changing', 'things', 'better', 'present', 'future.You', 'can', 'tell', 'director', 'John', 'R.', 'Leonetti', 'put', 'blood', 'sweat', 'movie', 'was', 'limited', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'budget', ""n't"", 'feel', 'straight-to-DVD', 'movie', 'camerawork', 'wreck', 'realistic', 'most', 'time-warp', 'scenes', 'look', 'decent', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'means', 'get', 'job', 'done.One', 'issue', 'film', 'are', 'points', 'where', 'late-night', 'Cinemax', 'skin', 'flick', 'are', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'sequences', 'feel', 'placed', 'film', 'attract', 'audience', 'base', 'feel', 'movie', 'focus', 'relatively', 'decent', 'storyline.The', 'high-definition', 'transfer', 'great', 'picture', 'almost', 'too', 'clean', 'digital', 'feel', 'distracting', 'points', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'mix', 'crashes', 'gunshots', 'atmospheric', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'well.Extra', 'features', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'John', 'R.', 'Leonetti', 'co-producer', 'Michael', 'Stirling', 'A', 'Making', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Altering', 'Reality', 'Set', ""'The"", 'Butterfly', 'Effect', '2', 'shows', 'scenes', 'footage', 'respect', 'film', 'more', 'also', 'how', 'accomplished', 'crash', 'semi', 'SUV', 'unimpressive', 'trailer', 'movie', 'also', 'included', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', '2', 'own', ""n't"", 'require', 'anyone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'first', 'film', 'grasping', 'what', 'happening', ""'re"", 'looking', 'upgrade', 'home', 'movie', 'collection', ""'ll"", 'want', 'buy', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'strictly', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'who', 'never', 'saw', 'just', 'happen', 'one', 'first']",N/A

I don't think the seatbelt would have saved her;5- the ""update"" to being currently PC, is seen by a male-on-male scene.  it was easy to see coming, and just as contrived;6- the ending is disturbing not due to gore, but due to the message that suicide will work out best for those you love.And pardon me, but did they TRY to make Eric Lively look like Tom Brady?

What human being would say that.I liked part 1, so when I saw there was a sequel, even knowing it had a very low rating, I wanted to give it chance. I love time travel movies, so if this was ANYTHING like the first one, at a minimum I figured I would get a moderate amount of enjoyment out of it.All I got was a moderate amount of homicidal thoughts after this. I can't believe that professionals can actually create something so bad. Put aside the bland acting and the boring writing for a second, and look at the way the script was structured. The movie was a little less than 90 minutes long, yet nothing even happens for the first 52 minutes, when the movie's more than half over. There was no development of story or characters whatsoever. A complete waste of 52 minutes of screen time.Whoever wrote this did the equivalent of building a roller coaster that travels from one side of the park to the other without EVER GOING UP, and instead travels across in a completely straight line, and so as you exit off the coaster, you're wondering ""wtf was that??"" The writer of this story forgot to add the one key element that makes all stories work on some level: some conflict for a protagonist to overcome, obviously. Nothing resembling drama or suspense took place until either the 52 minute mark, or the 61 minute mark. It all depends on whether you would consider his confrontation with his friend in the garage at the 52 minute mark as something significant that builds the story and moves it forward. If not, then there's definitely NOTHING that happens until the 61 minute mark, which is when he realizes that he's no longer in a relationship with his girlfriend. Now that's actually pretty interesting. But why are we JUST NOW getting into the realm of ""he has to fix this disastrous timeline he's now in, one without his girlfriend,"" with only less than a HALF HOUR of the movie left?

And the first movie raised the stakes by throwing in an ""every jump could be his last"" immediacy, the sequel decides to let the guy have a nosebleed without explanation.Even more odious is the low stakes of the jumps. Sure, Erica Durance dies in the beginning so you can see why he jumps back. Only when he jumps back the second time, he is doing it to get that promotion in the badly managed company. That's it.

Not that I am blaming them for that, but at least they could have done that much better than ""The Butterfly Effect 2"" where the hero with a special ability to go back in time finds once again that fixing things are not easy as it seems. Or does he? The difference is that ""BE2"" has neither Ashton Kutcher nor the tightly-knit script of the original that made the film an instant hit.Eric Lively plays Nick Larson, who loses his girlfriend Julie (Erica Durance) in a car accident. One year later Nick learns that he can change the course of the events by literally going back to the day when the fatal accident happened. But does he succeed? Of course he does.According the concept of ""Butterfly Effect,"" a small change can alter the whole world - like Ray Bradbury's famous story - and that is also the point of the first film. In the sequel, however, Eric can do what he thinks he has to do so easily (after a wobbling image surrounding him and a headache) that there is no point of using the fascinating concept of the title. Actually, you have no intricate plot, no mystery, no characters to relate, and no good ending. You only get stereotypical characters including ""terrifying"" gangsters, and silly love-making. To make matters worse, Eric even uses his special power to do what ordinary people (like me) usually do with hard working: getting rich.That's where I started to lose interest in the story, which evidently needs more improvement, at least ten more twists and turns in the predictable plot.

But no, he dumps her, says nothing until it's to late again, and then he ends up sacrificing himself to save her...who goes on to have their baby....and they even left a sliver of a chance for sequel for this junk to top it all off.Summed up, movie could have been over in 5 minutes, lets drag it to 92.  Even when they tired to keep you intriged by ""hinting"" at a lost pregnancy, they telegraphed it from the begining by her ""wanting to share news"", which is usually in a movie Pregnancy news, and then even after the first warp her laying it for him as saying ""we both know what we lost with the accident"" and it sailing by this idiots face.  Just honestly, SAVE YOUR MONEY, or rent it if you just can't resist seeing a bad movie. Or as one other reviewer stated, con a friend into renting it for you, although i think you may loose that friend after they realize what they rented.",1,"Not really a sequel, and simple answer, ask for her news first., BAD MOVIE",1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2006,2000,"['was', 'semi-excited', 'see', 'coming', 'out', 'today', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'SAVE', 'YOUR', 'MONEY', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'sequel', 'almost', 'B-run', 'rip', 'first', 'even', 'B-movies', 'Yes', 'guy', 'can', 'shift', 'outcomes', 'warping', 'time', 'using', 'pictures..but', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'common', 'first', 'movie', 'simple', 'enough', 'back', 'save', 'friends', 'death', 'car', 'accident', 'had', 'were', 'going', 'back', 'town', 'main', 'character', 'get', 'work', 'Now', 'easy', 'enough', 'fix', 'warp', 'back', 'time', 'picture', 'took', 'park', 'decide', 'stay', 'movie', 'sorry', 'was', 'so', 'short', 'No', 'tried', 'make', 'story', 'warps', 'back', 'using', 'other', 'picture', 'car', 'now', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'story', 'line', 'greedy', 'Then', 'back', 'using', 'christmas', 'photo', 'worse', 'woman', 'mafia', 'guy', 'who', 'friend', 'Now', 'finally', 'use', 'picture', 'park', 'mess', 'up', 'had', 'do', 'say', 'will', 'stay', 'day', 'then', 'should', 'ask', 'news', 'first', 'nothing', 'late', 'again', 'then', 'up', 'sacrificing', 'save', 'who', 'have', 'baby', '.and', 'even', 'left', 'sliver', 'chance', 'sequel', 'junk', 'top', 'off.Summed', 'up', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', '5', 'minutes', 'lets', 'drag', '92', 'Even', 'when', 'tired', 'keep', 'intriged', 'hinting', 'lost', 'pregnancy', 'telegraphed', 'begining', 'wanting', 'share', 'news', 'usually', 'movie', 'Pregnancy', 'news', 'then', 'even', 'first', 'warp', 'laying', 'saying', 'know', 'what', 'lost', 'accident', 'sailing', 'idiots', 'face', 'Just', 'honestly', 'SAVE', 'YOUR', 'MONEY', 'rent', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'seeing', 'bad', 'movie', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'friend', 'renting', 'i', 'think', 'may', 'loose', 'friend', 'realize', 'what', 'rented']",N/A
