348067,ACC1SLND21RI6,630296928X,Breyel,"[27, 30]","On the surface, Jean Renoir's film ""The River"" is a docu-drama on India and its people, replete with temples, religious festivals and cultural practices, set amidst the backdrop of the Bengal River. Scratch the surface and ""The River"" becomes a metaphor on the meaning of life, or at least the Hindu concept of it -- a cycle of births and deaths.Several scenes allude to this theme. For instance, the statue of Hindu goddess Kali, symbolising creation and destruction, is moulded from the river's clay and returns to clay when it is submerged in the river after devotees complete a ritual celebration. Mr. John (Arthur Shields) at one point philosophises on life with his American cousin, Capt. John (Thomas E. Breen), stating one man jumps from the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge while another goes on his way across the bridge. When young Bogey (Richard Foster), Harriet's brother, dies from a cobra's bite a sibling is born some months after his death.Between birth and death are the lives of ordinary people who reside, work, play or worship along the river. Some face conflict which is either solved or insoluble. Capt. John is the war veteran (unspecified war) who has lost a leg and is struggling to put his past behind him. Valerie, Melanie and Harriet (Adrienne Court, Radha and Patricia Walters) are adolescent girls who express their respective infatuations for Capt. John and their ensuing growing pains. Mr. John is the British expatriate and widower who has contentedly adopted the ways and culture of India, yet agonises over the mixed-race status his marriage to an Indian woman has created for his daughter Melanie. Harriet's father  (Esmond Knight) is the manager of a jute factory, busy with its operation, yet concerned about his children growing up. Boats laden with jute ply the river bringing Indian labourers, pursuing their livelihood. And holy men spend their days mediating at the banks of the river. The point is, each represents an extension of how humanity as a whole goes about living between birth and death.As for the photography, ""The River"" is nothing short of spectacular. Interestingly, it was the first Technicolor film shot in India, which apparently posed some inherent technical limitations that Renoir had to overcome while filming in the tropics, which makes it all the more magnificient. The result is an impressionist's dream. Renoir does a Renoir in setting up shots that could have been stills from his father's own paintings. Look for the twin girls sleeping, the nanny and children peering through a colonnade lined railing, the teenage girls sneaking a view of Capt. John's arrival from a crumbling brick fence. There are so many lovely images, actually far too many to mention in this review.Some reviewers have commented about the weak performances of the actors. While this is a fair assessment, Renoir had little choice. Had he compromised artistic preference and authenticity for the stereotypical India the studio heads in Hollywood wanted, perhaps the funding for more notable actors of the day could have been cast. When producer Kenneth McEldowney, a newcomer to the film industry, consented to Renoir's concept for ""The River"" funding was limited to no more than a handful of well-known actors. Although he cast amateurs like Breen (an actual amputee) and Radha (a classical Indian dancer), it is arguable their personal backgrounds made their roles more realistic and believable.All in all, ""The River: Criterion Collection"" is EXCELLENT. In addition to this beautiful 90-minute movie, there's a commentary from Martin Scorsese -- a key figure in the restoration of the film, an interview with Jean Renoir, a conversation with Rumer Godden, the author of ""The River"", as well as the original theatrical trailer and some off screen stills taken during the filming. A booklet comes with this collection too, featuring essays from notable film scholars (Ian Christie and Alexander Sesonske) and technical insight on the restoration of the film.",5,Renoir's River of Life is a Masterpiece on the Human Condition,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,4004,"['surface', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'film', 'River', 'docu-drama', 'India', 'people', 'replete', 'temples', 'religious', 'festivals', 'cultural', 'practices', 'set', 'amidst', 'backdrop', 'Bengal', 'River', 'Scratch', 'surface', 'River', 'metaphor', 'meaning', 'life', 'least', 'Hindu', 'concept', 'cycle', 'births', 'deaths.Several', 'scenes', 'allude', 'theme', 'instance', 'statue', 'Hindu', 'goddess', 'Kali', 'symbolising', 'creation', 'destruction', 'moulded', 'river', 'clay', 'returns', 'clay', 'when', 'submerged', 'river', 'devotees', 'complete', 'ritual', 'celebration', 'Mr.', 'John', 'Arthur', 'Shields', 'one', 'point', 'philosophises', 'life', 'American', 'cousin', 'Capt', 'John', 'Thomas', 'E.', 'Breen', 'stating', 'one', 'man', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'way', 'bridge', 'When', 'young', 'Bogey', 'Richard', 'Foster', 'Harriet', 'brother', 'cobra', 'bite', 'sibling', 'born', 'months', 'death.Between', 'birth', 'death', 'are', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'reside', 'work', 'play', 'worship', 'river', 'face', 'conflict', 'solved', 'insoluble', 'Capt', 'John', 'war', 'veteran', 'unspecified', 'war', 'who', 'lost', 'leg', 'struggling', 'put', 'past', 'Valerie', 'Melanie', 'Harriet', 'Adrienne', 'Court', 'Radha', 'Patricia', 'Walters', 'are', 'adolescent', 'girls', 'who', 'express', 'respective', 'infatuations', 'Capt', 'John', 'ensuing', 'growing', 'pains', 'Mr.', 'John', 'British', 'expatriate', 'widower', 'who', 'contentedly', 'adopted', 'ways', 'culture', 'India', 'yet', 'mixed-race', 'status', 'marriage', 'Indian', 'woman', 'created', 'daughter', 'Melanie', 'Harriet', 'father', 'Esmond', 'Knight', 'manager', 'jute', 'factory', 'busy', 'operation', 'yet', 'concerned', 'children', 'growing', 'up', 'Boats', 'laden', 'jute', 'ply', 'river', 'bringing', 'Indian', 'labourers', 'pursuing', 'livelihood', 'holy', 'men', 'spend', 'days', 'mediating', 'banks', 'river', 'point', 'extension', 'how', 'humanity', 'whole', 'living', 'birth', 'death.As', 'photography', 'River', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'Interestingly', 'was', 'first', 'Technicolor', 'film', 'shot', 'India', 'apparently', 'posed', 'inherent', 'technical', 'limitations', 'Renoir', 'had', 'overcome', 'filming', 'tropics', 'more', 'magnificient', 'result', 'impressionist', 'dream', 'Renoir', 'Renoir', 'setting', 'up', 'shots', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stills', 'father', 'own', 'paintings', 'Look', 'twin', 'girls', 'sleeping', 'nanny', 'children', 'peering', 'colonnade', 'lined', 'railing', 'teenage', 'girls', 'sneaking', 'view', 'Capt', 'John', 'arrival', 'crumbling', 'brick', 'fence', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'lovely', 'images', 'actually', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'mention', 'review.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'weak', 'performances', 'actors', 'fair', 'assessment', 'Renoir', 'had', 'little', 'choice', 'Had', 'compromised', 'artistic', 'preference', 'authenticity', 'stereotypical', 'India', 'studio', 'heads', 'Hollywood', 'wanted', 'perhaps', 'funding', 'more', 'notable', 'actors', 'day', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'When', 'producer', 'Kenneth', 'McEldowney', 'newcomer', 'film', 'industry', 'consented', 'Renoir', 'concept', 'River', 'funding', 'was', 'limited', 'more', 'handful', 'well-known', 'actors', 'cast', 'amateurs', 'Breen', 'actual', 'amputee', 'Radha', 'classical', 'Indian', 'dancer', 'arguable', 'personal', 'backgrounds', 'made', 'roles', 'more', 'realistic', 'believable.All', 'River', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'EXCELLENT', 'addition', 'beautiful', '90-minute', 'movie', 'commentary', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'key', 'figure', 'restoration', 'film', 'interview', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'conversation', 'Rumer', 'Godden', 'author', 'River', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'off', 'screen', 'stills', 'taken', 'filming', 'booklet', 'collection', 'too', 'featuring', 'essays', 'notable', 'film', 'scholars', 'Ian', 'Christie', 'Alexander', 'Sesonske', 'technical', 'insight', 'restoration', 'film']",The River Jean Renoir  VHS
348068,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,630296928X,C. O. DeRiemer,"[112, 114]","This is a movie of great calm and humanity, which moves at its own rhythms. It's also a beautiful movie, shot in India by one of the great visual directors of our time. The story may seem simple on the surface, but it moves deeply into the currents of life, using India and the Ganges as metaphor. I can only say that the movie is an affecting look at how life goes on and how we grow within our lives.The River tells its story through three girls on the brink of adulthood. Harriet, the daughter of the English manager of a jute mill on the banks of the Ganges; Radha, the daughter of their English neighbor whose mother was Indian; and Valerie, the daughter of a wealthy English couple whom we never meet. The three are close friends but each is dealing with with their changes in their own way. Then one day the American cousin of their neighbor arrives to stay for awhile. He lost his leg in the war and is handsome. All the girls develop feelings for him and suddenly their own feelings for each other begin to change. And he has problems of his own. He hasn't come to grips with having only one leg, nor with what he feels is the pity toward him he has encountered. The reality of his life weighs on him. As the most mature of the girls tells him, ""After a war yesterday's hero is only a man with one leg.""The story is told through the narration of Harriet as an adult. ""Suddenly"" she says, ""we were running away from childhood and rushing toward love."" In the course of four seasons they experience the ebb and flow of emotions just as the river ebbs and flows. There is a death, a birth, and life goes on. And by the end of the movie they, and we, have learned a good deal more about ourselves.I like this movie a lot, and I have a great respect for it. The Criterion DVD restores the picture to all of its Technicolor glory. It looks stunning. There are several extras. A short introduction by Renoir gives a fascinating look at what it took to get the film made. Martin Scorsese gives an appreciation of the film which is enlightening.One sidelight is that the actor, Esmond Knight, who plays the father, was for all practical purposes blind. He enlisted in the royal navy at the start of WWII. During the battle to sink the Bismarck he had one eye destroyed and lost nearly all sight in the other. After he was invalided out he was determined to resume his acting career. His wife would teach him the lines for his movies and stage plays; he would memorize them (and everyone else's) by hearing them. She and others would block out his movements on the sets so that he could memorize exactly where the director wanted him to be, where he had to move, and all this in relation to the movements of the other cast members. Since he was blind, he had to master the technique of knowing exactly where to look so that it would appear he was looking where he should be. I challenge anyone to watch this movie and not be utterly convinced Knight was sighted. To my knowledge, he never played a blind man...and he had a long career in the movies (including five Powell/Pressburger films) and on the stage.",5,A Wonderful Movie Of Great Humanity By Jean Renoir,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,3107,"['movie', 'great', 'calm', 'humanity', 'own', 'rhythms', 'also', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'shot', 'India', 'one', 'great', 'visual', 'directors', 'time', 'story', 'may', 'seem', 'simple', 'surface', 'deeply', 'currents', 'life', 'using', 'India', 'Ganges', 'metaphor', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'movie', 'affecting', 'look', 'how', 'life', 'how', 'grow', 'lives.The', 'River', 'story', 'three', 'girls', 'brink', 'adulthood', 'Harriet', 'daughter', 'English', 'manager', 'jute', 'mill', 'banks', 'Ganges', 'Radha', 'daughter', 'English', 'neighbor', 'mother', 'was', 'Indian', 'Valerie', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'English', 'couple', 'whom', 'never', 'meet', 'three', 'are', 'close', 'friends', 'dealing', 'changes', 'own', 'way', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'American', 'cousin', 'neighbor', 'stay', 'awhile', 'lost', 'leg', 'war', 'handsome', 'girls', 'develop', 'feelings', 'suddenly', 'own', 'feelings', 'other', 'begin', 'change', 'problems', 'own', ""n't"", 'come', 'grips', 'having', 'only', 'one', 'leg', 'what', 'pity', 'encountered', 'reality', 'life', 'weighs', 'most', 'mature', 'girls', 'war', 'yesterday', 'hero', 'only', 'man', 'one', 'leg', 'story', 'told', 'narration', 'Harriet', 'adult', 'Suddenly', 'were', 'running', 'away', 'childhood', 'rushing', 'love', 'course', 'four', 'seasons', 'experience', 'ebb', 'flow', 'emotions', 'just', 'river', 'ebbs', 'death', 'birth', 'life', 'end', 'movie', 'have', 'learned', 'good', 'deal', 'more', 'ourselves.I', 'movie', 'lot', 'have', 'great', 'respect', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'picture', 'Technicolor', 'glory', 'stunning', 'are', 'several', 'extras', 'short', 'introduction', 'Renoir', 'fascinating', 'look', 'what', 'took', 'get', 'film', 'made', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'appreciation', 'film', 'enlightening.One', 'sidelight', 'actor', 'Esmond', 'Knight', 'who', 'father', 'was', 'practical', 'purposes', 'blind', 'enlisted', 'royal', 'navy', 'start', 'WWII', 'battle', 'sink', 'Bismarck', 'had', 'one', 'eye', 'destroyed', 'lost', 'nearly', 'sight', 'other', 'was', 'invalided', 'out', 'was', 'determined', 'resume', 'acting', 'career', 'wife', 'would', 'teach', 'lines', 'movies', 'stage', 'plays', 'would', 'memorize', 'everyone', 'else', 'hearing', 'others', 'would', 'block', 'out', 'movements', 'sets', 'so', 'could', 'memorize', 'exactly', 'where', 'director', 'wanted', 'be', 'where', 'had', 'move', 'relation', 'movements', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'was', 'blind', 'had', 'master', 'technique', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'where', 'look', 'so', 'would', 'appear', 'was', 'looking', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'challenge', 'anyone', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'utterly', 'convinced', 'Knight', 'was', 'sighted', 'knowledge', 'never', 'played', 'blind', 'man', 'had', 'long', 'career', 'movies', 'including', 'five', 'Powell/Pressburger', 'films', 'stage']",The River Jean Renoir  VHS
348069,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,630296928X,Douglas Doepke,"[5, 6]","How wonderful are the rhythms, color, and imagery as they flow lyrically along - man, beast, spreading tree. They succeed one another like the film's central metaphor, the living continuum, the river of life. The lyricism, however, tends to flatten out the story's sparse drama in a way that requires some patience. In fact, these rhythms are the point -- life, death, renewal --  all beautifully photographed in great splashes of technicolor. To contemporary audiences, a film like this must seem an import from an alien world, and I suspect it was not  commercial  even on release -- who else in the US but an art house would show it!  The story is slender and idealized, set indelibly in India, and likely the author's fond reminiscence of  childood under the British protectorate. Except for the boy's muted passing, not much really happens.The only conflict involves three girls competing for a youngish war veteran, and it's a measure of Renoir's  approach that the competition never interferes with their friendship. Everyone, it seems, behaves with admirable restraint, even the dutiful servants, all of which serves to somewhat prettify the British presence. Nevertheless, this is one of those movies that creeps up on you. It's only afterwards, when the images have had a chance to linger and luminesce, that their sum total registers and you know you've seen something lasting. I, for one, am glad Renoir defied the rule and did not use pretty people; that would only have emphasized plot over theme, and individual over universal. Moreover, I wish more ordinary looking people appeared in movies, especially from Hollywood. Finding the unusual in the usual is the kind of thing I believe this movie was trying to bring out, while learning that lesson would do much to heal our celebrity-driven culture.  This is a Renoir classic and demonstrates once again, amidst a slam-bang world, what can be done on the plane of artistic understatement.",5,Artistic Understatement,1066262400,"10 16, 2003",2003,1953,"['How', 'wonderful', 'are', 'rhythms', 'color', 'imagery', 'flow', 'lyrically', 'man', 'beast', 'spreading', 'tree', 'succeed', 'one', 'film', 'central', 'metaphor', 'living', 'continuum', 'river', 'life', 'lyricism', 'however', 'flatten', 'out', 'story', 'sparse', 'drama', 'way', 'patience', 'fact', 'rhythms', 'are', 'point', 'life', 'death', 'renewal', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'great', 'splashes', 'technicolor', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'film', 'must', 'seem', 'import', 'alien', 'world', 'suspect', 'was', 'not', 'commercial', 'even', 'release', 'who', 'else', 'US', 'art', 'house', 'would', 'show', 'story', 'slender', 'idealized', 'set', 'indelibly', 'India', 'likely', 'author', 'fond', 'reminiscence', 'childood', 'British', 'protectorate', 'boy', 'muted', 'passing', 'not', 'much', 'really', 'only', 'conflict', 'involves', 'three', 'girls', 'competing', 'youngish', 'war', 'veteran', 'measure', 'Renoir', 'approach', 'competition', 'never', 'friendship', 'Everyone', 'behaves', 'admirable', 'restraint', 'even', 'dutiful', 'servants', 'somewhat', 'prettify', 'British', 'presence', 'Nevertheless', 'one', 'movies', 'creeps', 'up', 'only', 'afterwards', 'when', 'images', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'linger', 'luminesce', 'sum', 'total', 'registers', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'something', 'lasting', 'one', 'am', 'glad', 'Renoir', 'defied', 'rule', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'pretty', 'people', 'would', 'only', 'have', 'emphasized', 'plot', 'theme', 'individual', 'universal', 'Moreover', 'wish', 'more', 'ordinary', 'looking', 'people', 'appeared', 'movies', 'especially', 'Hollywood', 'Finding', 'unusual', 'usual', 'kind', 'thing', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'bring', 'out', 'learning', 'lesson', 'would', 'do', 'much', 'heal', 'celebrity-driven', 'culture', 'Renoir', 'classic', 'once', 'again', 'amidst', 'slam-bang', 'world', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'plane', 'artistic', 'understatement']",The River Jean Renoir  VHS
348070,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,630296928X,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 10]","This is not quite the rediscovered masterpiece some have asserted, but there are pleasures to be had with the river-as-life metaphor, which frames and drives master filmmaker Jean Renoir's 1951 film about the waning years of British colonial life in India. As experienced by Harriet, a young, impressionable British girl, the story is essentially one long flashback whose unseen narrator is really the grown-up version of Harriet. Based on a novel by Rumer Godden, her nostalgic descriptions of her early childhood in Bengal conjure up the images presented here of a time long past, when her family lived along a tributary river bank of the sacred Ganges.There is little in the way of a plot as the movie drifts at a leisurely pace from one episode to the next with the insertion of National Geographic-style documentary scenes, in particular, focusing on the traditional Diwali festival of lights and ceremonies praising the  goddess Kali. The main storyline involves Captain John, a dashing American war veteran who has lost his leg and a sense of purpose, as he shows up and becomes the center of attention for not only Harriet but her flighty friend Valerie and a half-caste friend named Melanie. Along the way, Harriet creates a Hindu-based story to get the captain's attention away from the alluring Valerie, Melanie is on a search for her own identity, and Harriet's mischievous brother becomes drawn to a deadly cobra in the woods. It's fair to say that the plot strands sort themselves out in predictable fashion with death followed by birth to emphasize the continuity of the river that sustains them and the villagers. With the exception of a few British veterans like Nora Swinburne as the mother, the cast is comprised mostly of children and amateurs (including an affecting Patricia Walters as Harriet), which further feeds into the documentary feel of the film. Thomas E. Breen, a real-life amputee, plays Captain John admirably after appearing in only minor roles in a couple of Hollywood movies. Neither Walters nor Breen made another film after this one. Fortunately the lack of experienced actors does not detract from the film's innate exoticism, brightly-hued scenery, and authentic regional music, which provide the idyllic setting for Renoir's exploration of the fragility of human existence. Renoir's nephew Claude produced the luminous Technicolor cinematography, which is captured well though not exceptionally in the Criterion DVD package.Extras with the Criterion package include a 13-minute 2004 interview with Martin Scorsese, who was instrumental in pushing forward the restoration effort. As a champion for film restoration, Scorsese talks about the film's impact on him as a child and explores in some detail the techniques Renoir deployed in his quest for authenticity. Renoir himself is captured in a brief video introduction for the film, as he discusses the circumstances which brought him together with florist-turned-fledgling producer Ken McEldowney to make the movie. An intriguing, uncompromising man, McEldowney himself is interviewed in just audio format as he discusses his mission to make the movie against seemingly insurmountable odds. The best feature of the package, however, is the hour-long documentary, ""Rumer Godden: An Indian Affair"", produced in 1995, which traces in visually stunning detail the life of the novelist as she returns to the India of her childhood and revisits remembered sites and memories long past.",4,India Captured in Vivid Nostalgic Detail,1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,3472,"['not', 'quite', 'rediscovered', 'masterpiece', 'have', 'asserted', 'are', 'pleasures', 'be', 'had', 'river-as-life', 'metaphor', 'master', 'filmmaker', 'Jean', 'Renoir', '1951', 'film', 'waning', 'years', 'British', 'colonial', 'life', 'India', 'experienced', 'Harriet', 'young', 'impressionable', 'British', 'girl', 'story', 'essentially', 'one', 'long', 'flashback', 'unseen', 'narrator', 'really', 'grown-up', 'version', 'Harriet', 'Based', 'novel', 'Rumer', 'Godden', 'nostalgic', 'descriptions', 'early', 'childhood', 'Bengal', 'conjure', 'up', 'images', 'presented', 'here', 'time', 'long', 'past', 'when', 'family', 'lived', 'tributary', 'river', 'bank', 'sacred', 'Ganges.There', 'little', 'way', 'plot', 'movie', 'drifts', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'insertion', 'National', 'Geographic-style', 'documentary', 'scenes', 'particular', 'focusing', 'traditional', 'Diwali', 'festival', 'lights', 'ceremonies', 'praising', 'goddess', 'Kali', 'main', 'storyline', 'Captain', 'John', 'dashing', 'American', 'war', 'veteran', 'who', 'lost', 'leg', 'sense', 'purpose', 'up', 'center', 'attention', 'not', 'only', 'Harriet', 'flighty', 'friend', 'Valerie', 'half-caste', 'friend', 'named', 'Melanie', 'way', 'Harriet', 'Hindu-based', 'story', 'get', 'captain', 'attention', 'away', 'alluring', 'Valerie', 'Melanie', 'search', 'own', 'identity', 'Harriet', 'mischievous', 'brother', 'drawn', 'deadly', 'cobra', 'woods', 'fair', 'say', 'plot', 'sort', 'out', 'predictable', 'fashion', 'death', 'followed', 'birth', 'emphasize', 'continuity', 'river', 'villagers', 'exception', 'few', 'British', 'veterans', 'Nora', 'Swinburne', 'mother', 'cast', 'comprised', 'mostly', 'children', 'amateurs', 'including', 'affecting', 'Patricia', 'Walters', 'Harriet', 'further', 'documentary', 'feel', 'film', 'Thomas', 'E.', 'Breen', 'real-life', 'amputee', 'Captain', 'John', 'admirably', 'appearing', 'only', 'minor', 'roles', 'couple', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Walters', 'Breen', 'made', 'film', 'one', 'Fortunately', 'lack', 'experienced', 'actors', 'not', 'detract', 'film', 'innate', 'exoticism', 'brightly-hued', 'scenery', 'authentic', 'regional', 'music', 'provide', 'idyllic', 'setting', 'Renoir', 'exploration', 'fragility', 'human', 'existence', 'Renoir', 'nephew', 'Claude', 'produced', 'luminous', 'Technicolor', 'cinematography', 'captured', 'well', 'not', 'exceptionally', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'package.Extras', 'Criterion', 'package', 'include', '13-minute', '2004', 'interview', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'who', 'was', 'instrumental', 'pushing', 'forward', 'restoration', 'effort', 'champion', 'film', 'restoration', 'Scorsese', 'talks', 'film', 'impact', 'child', 'explores', 'detail', 'techniques', 'Renoir', 'deployed', 'quest', 'authenticity', 'Renoir', 'captured', 'brief', 'video', 'introduction', 'film', 'circumstances', 'brought', 'together', 'florist-turned-fledgling', 'producer', 'Ken', 'McEldowney', 'make', 'movie', 'intriguing', 'uncompromising', 'man', 'McEldowney', 'interviewed', 'just', 'audio', 'format', 'mission', 'make', 'movie', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'best', 'feature', 'package', 'however', 'hour-long', 'documentary', 'Rumer', 'Godden', 'Indian', 'Affair', 'produced', '1995', 'visually', 'stunning', 'detail', 'life', 'novelist', 'India', 'childhood', 'revisits', 'remembered', 'sites', 'memories', 'long', 'past']",The River Jean Renoir  VHS

348075,A6ADO7B6FUVN,630296928X,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 5]","The River offers a riveting cinematic experience presented in Technicolor, which projected the strong colors of the environment around the one of many Indian rivers.  These strong colors reveal the symbolic contrast for the cultural differences between Western and Indian culture, which is an essential part of the film.  Selflessly, Jean Renoir directs this film, as he brings the audience on a cultural journey into the foreign traditions through the daily life of an English family and a young teenager.  Through the family, Renoir offers a visual presentation of the ethnic differences that stand out even more in relation to the British family who have adapted to the culture in which they coexist.  This is elevated through camerawork that provides a feeling of non-fiction, and a depiction of the truth.In its presentation, the River does not seem like much, but it is here the magic rests.  Renoir uses a simplistic approach to the story that reveals the mundane of everyday life and how it would be to live in India.  Through this routine, the audience gets to see and hear how things are along the exotic and sacred river next to which they live.  The audience will learn about the origin to the people's beliefs, morals, and values that color the life for those who live along the river.  Harriet (Patricia Walters), a young teenage girl, provides thorough illustrations of the Indian society and culture, as she writes poetry and is on the verge of becoming a woman.The story focuses on Harriet who also is the story's narrator, as she discloses this story from her youthful years growing up along a river in India.  Besides Harriet, the audience gets to meet her confident friend Valerie (Adrienne Corri) who is the only daughter of a rich family.  Together these two teens fall in love with Captain John (Thomas E. Breen), an American World War II veteran.  Harriet and Valerie begin to secretively compete for Captain John and Valerie decides to take no prisoners, as her approach brings the notion of Western attitude that expresses that everything is allowed in love and war.  Harriet on the other hand brings forth a mixed approach of both Western and Indian culture in her attempt to gain Captain John's attention through providing a detailed description of herself through the Hindu society in which she lives.A third girl, Melanie (Radha) has recently finished school and returned home to find herself outside in a cultural and social predicament.  Melanie is the daughter of the Western man, Mr. John (Arthur Shields), and her late Hindu mother.  Her birth into two different cultures has left her in a social no man's land, as the Indian society's caste system leaves her without a caste and the Western society does not welcome her.  Even her father, Mr. John, thinks that it was cruel to bring her into the world.  Nonetheless, she also has feelings like the other girls, as it seems that she has feelings for Captain John.  However, she does not overtly express her feelings, as she continues to yearn for him at a distance.Life and death are crucial portions of the culture where Harriet lives, as she narrates ""Kali the goddess of eternal destruction and creation - creation impossible without destruction.""  This suggests a cyclical existence where once something is created it will eventually be destroyed and once destroyed it will be created again.  Harriet's youngest sister Victoria even embraced this notion, as she pretends her rabbit Hoppity is a newborn--an idea that seems to go against Harriet's logic to which she points out that Hoppity was a new born last week too.  However, Victoria simply states, ""Babies can be born again and again, can't they?""The river becomes an analogy for fundamental existential ideas of cyclical existence, as it continues to flow as it has done for millennia.  The river starts its flow in the Himalayas, as it is continuously replenished by new melted snow and it runs down to the Bay of Bengal.  The water returns to the hills and mountains in the north through monsoons to once again flow down streams to the Bay of Bengal.  Amidst the water of the river wildlife, fish and people coexist in life and death, which is brought to all by the water of the river.  This image is provided in the opening of the film, which offers an honest depiction of the culture in which the story takes place.The River is a much smaller film compared to Renoir's previous accomplishments, but it does not lack artistic skillfulness and thoughtful design.  On the contrary, the River is much more personal as it slowly embeds itself in the cerebral cortex where it provides much contemplation for those who seek it.  Renoir does not seem to care whether the film has an exciting story or pleases hordes of moviegoers.  Instead he simply lets the characters seem to exist in an environment where the river destroys life and over again offers birth.  This film brings the audience a brilliant cinematic experience, which displays that Renoir truly is elevating his personal visual storytelling through his own visions.",5,Brilliantly Colorful and Culturally Insightful Cinema,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,5071,"['River', 'riveting', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'presented', 'Technicolor', 'projected', 'strong', 'colors', 'environment', 'one', 'many', 'Indian', 'rivers', 'strong', 'colors', 'reveal', 'symbolic', 'contrast', 'cultural', 'differences', 'Western', 'Indian', 'culture', 'essential', 'part', 'film', 'Selflessly', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'film', 'audience', 'cultural', 'journey', 'foreign', 'traditions', 'daily', 'life', 'English', 'family', 'young', 'teenager', 'family', 'Renoir', 'visual', 'presentation', 'ethnic', 'differences', 'stand', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'relation', 'British', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'adapted', 'culture', 'coexist', 'elevated', 'camerawork', 'feeling', 'non-fiction', 'depiction', 'truth.In', 'presentation', 'River', 'not', 'seem', 'much', 'here', 'magic', 'rests', 'Renoir', 'simplistic', 'approach', 'story', 'mundane', 'everyday', 'life', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'live', 'India', 'routine', 'audience', 'see', 'hear', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'exotic', 'sacred', 'river', 'live', 'audience', 'will', 'learn', 'origin', 'people', 'beliefs', 'morals', 'values', 'color', 'life', 'who', 'live', 'river', 'Harriet', 'Patricia', 'Walters', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'thorough', 'illustrations', 'Indian', 'society', 'culture', 'poetry', 'verge', 'becoming', 'woman.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'Harriet', 'who', 'also', 'story', 'narrator', 'story', 'youthful', 'years', 'growing', 'up', 'river', 'India', 'Besides', 'Harriet', 'audience', 'meet', 'confident', 'friend', 'Valerie', 'Adrienne', 'Corri', 'who', 'only', 'daughter', 'rich', 'family', 'Together', 'two', 'teens', 'fall', 'love', 'Captain', 'John', 'Thomas', 'E.', 'Breen', 'American', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'veteran', 'Harriet', 'Valerie', 'begin', 'secretively', 'compete', 'Captain', 'John', 'Valerie', 'take', 'prisoners', 'approach', 'notion', 'Western', 'attitude', 'everything', 'allowed', 'love', 'war', 'Harriet', 'other', 'hand', 'brings', 'forth', 'mixed', 'approach', 'Western', 'Indian', 'culture', 'attempt', 'gain', 'Captain', 'John', 'attention', 'providing', 'detailed', 'description', 'Hindu', 'society', 'third', 'girl', 'Melanie', 'Radha', 'recently', 'finished', 'school', 'returned', 'home', 'find', 'outside', 'cultural', 'social', 'predicament', 'Melanie', 'daughter', 'Western', 'man', 'Mr.', 'John', 'Arthur', 'Shields', 'late', 'Hindu', 'mother', 'birth', 'two', 'different', 'cultures', 'left', 'social', 'man', 'land', 'Indian', 'society', 'caste', 'system', 'caste', 'Western', 'society', 'not', 'welcome', 'Even', 'father', 'Mr.', 'John', 'was', 'cruel', 'bring', 'world', 'Nonetheless', 'also', 'feelings', 'other', 'girls', 'feelings', 'Captain', 'John', 'However', 'not', 'overtly', 'express', 'feelings', 'yearn', 'distance.Life', 'death', 'are', 'crucial', 'portions', 'culture', 'where', 'Harriet', 'Kali', 'goddess', 'eternal', 'destruction', 'creation', 'creation', 'impossible', 'destruction', 'cyclical', 'existence', 'where', 'once', 'something', 'created', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'destroyed', 'once', 'destroyed', 'will', 'be', 'created', 'again', 'Harriet', 'youngest', 'sister', 'Victoria', 'even', 'embraced', 'notion', 'rabbit', 'Hoppity', 'newborn', 'idea', 'go', 'Harriet', 'logic', 'out', 'Hoppity', 'was', 'new', 'born', 'last', 'week', 'too', 'However', 'Victoria', 'simply', 'Babies', 'can', 'be', 'born', 'again', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'river', 'analogy', 'fundamental', 'existential', 'ideas', 'cyclical', 'existence', 'flow', 'done', 'millennia', 'river', 'flow', 'Himalayas', 'continuously', 'replenished', 'new', 'melted', 'snow', 'down', 'Bay', 'Bengal', 'water', 'returns', 'hills', 'mountains', 'north', 'monsoons', 'once', 'again', 'flow', 'down', 'streams', 'Bay', 'Bengal', 'Amidst', 'water', 'river', 'wildlife', 'fish', 'people', 'coexist', 'life', 'death', 'brought', 'water', 'river', 'image', 'provided', 'opening', 'film', 'honest', 'depiction', 'culture', 'story', 'place.The', 'River', 'much', 'smaller', 'film', 'compared', 'Renoir', 'previous', 'accomplishments', 'not', 'lack', 'artistic', 'skillfulness', 'thoughtful', 'design', 'contrary', 'River', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'slowly', 'cerebral', 'cortex', 'where', 'much', 'contemplation', 'who', 'seek', 'Renoir', 'not', 'seem', 'care', 'film', 'exciting', 'story', 'hordes', 'moviegoers', 'Instead', 'simply', 'characters', 'seem', 'exist', 'environment', 'where', 'river', 'life', 'over', 'again', 'offers', 'birth', 'film', 'audience', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Renoir', 'truly', 'elevating', 'personal', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'own', 'visions']",The River Jean Renoir  VHS

Moore,"[1, 1]","After seeing Jean Renoir's ""The River"" for a second time, I find I agree with most of the reviewers here that it does indeed deserve to be ranked among Renoir's masterpieces. Visually, it is magnificent; Renoir and his nephew Claude create image after image that thrillingly evoke the paintings of their father and grandfather, Auguste Renoir. The screenplay, by Renoir and Rumer Godden, is a powerful, moving love letter to India, the titular river signifying the ever-renewing cycles of birth, love, and death. Renoir is a tourist in India, but the most enlightened kind of tourist, approaching the country, its customs and its people with love and respect.On second viewing, I found the performances of Patricia Walters and Adrienne Corri easier to take; they are still obviously neophytes, but their gaucherie seems natural to the characters of two teenage girls still in the process of growing up. (Walters never made another film, but Corri had a long acting career, including ""A Clockwork Orange"" and a huge amount of British TV.) Unfortunately, Thomas E. Breen (Capt. John) and Radha (Melanie) still seem to be auditioning for Edward D. Wood, Jr. Renoir hired non-professional actors in a deliberate ploy to keep his budget down and avoid the meddling of studio bosses. Breen, an actual World War II amputee, and Radha, a superb Indian classical dancer, had the real-life credibility for their roles; they looked perfect, but the perfection was shattered every time they opened their mouths and their flat, wooden voices came out. (In Radha's case, her lack of acting talent was no hindrance to her future career; she became a leading theosophist and a close associate of Jiddu Krishnamurti.)On the other hand, the subtle, meditative performances of Arthur Shields, Esmond Knight and Nora Swinburne deserve abundant praise. Other reviewers on this site have paid moving tribute to the courage and devotion of Knight and Swinburne, a real-life married couple. Knight lost one eye in his World War II service and was rendered almost totally blind in the other; Swinburne read his lines to him and helped him to move around the sets, so that he was able to continue acting, playing sighted characters, to the end of his long career. (As an old man, Knight appeared at the very beginning of Richard Lester's ""Robin and Marian,"" his empty eye socket for all the world to see.)The inadequacy of some of the performances prevents ""The River"" from reaching the heights of ""Grand Illusion"" or ""The Rules of the Game.""

Usually I don't watch the special segments on the making of a film, the cast, the location, etc., but in this case I found all this information much more interesting than the film itself.  I think I watched it all because after I watched the film, I was somewhat disappointed and wanted to know what exactly all the fuss was about.  The movie is very visually artistic and enjoyable to watch with that expectation only.  India was gorgeous and unsurprisingly director Renoir kind of made the story and setting into a non-stop stream of watercolors.  I don't think I have ever seen anyone else do it better than he did in this film.  However, as for the storyline I found its presentation too ""French"" for me.  What I mean by this is that I have often found the female characters in French films made by male French directors to be too adoring, too emotional or too wicked, if not all three at nearly the same time.  There often is this element of melodrama and sudden emotional swings as if all the females were PMS'ing at the same time.  FYI, I'm female by the way.  Even some of the male characters acted too melodramatically for me.  I have not read the novel by Rummer Godden or any of her books for that matter so I do not know if this was how the book was written or was due to free license taken by the director.  However, there was an hour-long British TV program about Godden's life and her return to India decades later included on this DVD.  It was excellent!  This DVD is worth watching just for that alone.  I was mesmerized listening to her tell her life story and watching her reactions as she revisited scenes of her childhood and young womanhood.

Perhaps it's the fact that the story, which seems to be drawn from the author's own life, is told from the distance of age.  This gives it a patina, a bittersweet soft glow that acknowledges the emotions of life in a muted way.  Maybe it's the fact that the author is English and she tells us of some painful events with typical English reserve.Or maybe because Renoir was raised surrounded by beauty that he has the gift of bringing out the beauty of everyday human events.  Perhaps it's a stretch to compare his films in any way to his famous father's paintings but Scorsese does so I will too.  There is a roundness in painter Renoir's figures and an innate  affection and pleasantness in the scenes that carries over into this film. One has the feeling that the father loved his subjects and so does the son.  One is left feeling satisfied and pleased at the end.And, the color and the visuals are those of an artist--no doubt about that!The story is simple and, on the surface not a lot happens.  But it's like life....three girls on the brink of adolescence get a crush on a visiting American ex-soldier who has lost a leg in the war.  They quarrel and suffer their individual feelings in their pursuits of his attention, but as the wise mother says, it is for their own introduction to this phase of their lives.  And also, it's helpful to the fellow, too.  Her equanimity, as the girls sit and stew in their misery, exemplifies the spirit of the place. She also tells Harriet that the fact that she loves her husband makes the pain of childbirth a joy.  We see a Hindu festival where the clay Goddess is celebrated and then returned to the river to dissolve.  The events of the lives vary, from person to person, class to class, and race to race but they are all tied together by the still strong presence of the River, Life, which keeps on flowing.  And yet the film doesn't show just a grim acceptance of life's woes.  People are changed by their experiences.  Both Captain John and Radha come to accept their feelings of being outcasts.  That is the Western touch!The film is odd by its very limitations.  Lack of money prevented Renoir from hiring professional actors for most of the parts and their very amateur-ness is at first jarring.  The fellow who plays Captain John, is really a terrible actor--he was chosen because he was a genuine amputee.  But he plays a man who feels out of place, anyway, so his awkwardness suits the character.  Then Radha, a classical Indian dancer, plays the mixed blood English/Indian girl.  She performs her dance very well but her acting leaves a lot to be desired and she doesn't seem to have anything English about her.  But again, her character feels alien, and after a while all of these characters mix up together in an unusual but nice soup.  It works.Initially I was a little disappointed in the film but it leaves a nice afterglow so I give it five stars.  I liked the interviews with Renoir and Scorsese, too.  I haven't watched the documentary featuring the author, yet, but since several reviewers here have praised it, I intend to watch it.",5,"Affectionate, lyrical glimpse of a childhood in India",1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,3281,"['lovely', 'film', 'calm', 'feeling', 'realization', 'life', 'flows', 'river', 'bringing', 'pain', 'loss', 'joy', 'love', 'out', 'end', 'Perhaps', 'fact', 'story', 'be', 'drawn', 'author', 'own', 'life', 'told', 'distance', 'age', 'patina', 'bittersweet', 'soft', 'glow', 'emotions', 'life', 'muted', 'way', 'Maybe', 'fact', 'author', 'English', 'painful', 'events', 'typical', 'English', 'reserve.Or', 'maybe', 'Renoir', 'was', 'raised', 'surrounded', 'beauty', 'gift', 'bringing', 'out', 'beauty', 'everyday', 'human', 'events', 'Perhaps', 'stretch', 'compare', 'films', 'way', 'famous', 'father', 'paintings', 'Scorsese', 'so', 'will', 'too', 'roundness', 'painter', 'Renoir', 'figures', 'innate', 'affection', 'pleasantness', 'scenes', 'over', 'film', 'One', 'feeling', 'father', 'loved', 'subjects', 'so', 'son', 'One', 'left', 'feeling', 'satisfied', 'pleased', 'end.And', 'color', 'visuals', 'are', 'artist', 'doubt', 'story', 'simple', 'surface', 'not', 'lot', 'like', 'life', '.three', 'girls', 'brink', 'adolescence', 'get', 'crush', 'visiting', 'American', 'ex-soldier', 'who', 'lost', 'leg', 'war', 'quarrel', 'suffer', 'individual', 'feelings', 'pursuits', 'attention', 'wise', 'mother', 'own', 'introduction', 'phase', 'lives', 'also', 'helpful', 'fellow', 'too', 'Her', 'equanimity', 'girls', 'sit', 'stew', 'misery', 'spirit', 'place', 'also', 'Harriet', 'fact', 'husband', 'pain', 'childbirth', 'joy', 'see', 'Hindu', 'festival', 'where', 'clay', 'Goddess', 'celebrated', 'then', 'returned', 'river', 'dissolve', 'events', 'lives', 'vary', 'person', 'person', 'class', 'class', 'race', 'race', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'still', 'strong', 'presence', 'River', 'Life', 'flowing', 'yet', 'film', ""n't"", 'show', 'just', 'grim', 'acceptance', 'life', 'woes', 'People', 'are', 'changed', 'experiences', 'Captain', 'John', 'Radha', 'come', 'accept', 'feelings', 'being', 'outcasts', 'Western', 'touch', 'film', 'odd', 'very', 'limitations', 'Lack', 'money', 'prevented', 'Renoir', 'hiring', 'professional', 'actors', 'most', 'parts', 'very', 'amateur-ness', 'first', 'jarring', 'fellow', 'who', 'Captain', 'John', 'really', 'terrible', 'actor', 'was', 'chosen', 'was', 'genuine', 'amputee', 'man', 'who', 'place', 'anyway', 'awkwardness', 'suits', 'character', 'Then', 'Radha', 'classical', 'Indian', 'dancer', 'mixed', 'blood', 'English/Indian', 'girl', 'dance', 'very', 'well', 'acting', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'anything', 'English', 'again', 'character', 'feels', 'alien', 'characters', 'mix', 'up', 'together', 'unusual', 'nice', 'soup', 'works.Initially', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'film', 'nice', 'afterglow', 'so', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'liked', 'interviews', 'Renoir', 'Scorsese', 'too', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'author', 'yet', 'several', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'praised', 'intend', 'watch']",The River Jean Renoir  VHS

I have never seen any of his films and this one seemed to be a perfect choice.  I was hoping to experience traditional Indian music and dance thru this movie and my wishes did come true.  This is a wonderful story from the perspective of a young girl growing up in India.  Her family is British and they are many children in that family, most of them girls.  What struck me was that story is semi-autobiographical by the writer Rumer Gunnar.  While naration and plot are really beautiful it is the extras and documentaries that prompted me to give this review 5 stars. I liked all documentaries available on this DVD, but most impressive one was personal story from the writer who created this work.  I was deeply touched with her painful personal history and my next step will be to read some of her books since I find her to belong to a class of writers like Marguerite Duras and Isaak Dinesen.  For anyone who wants to learn about the East from the westerner's point of view, this is the best choice to go about it.

348087,A2WAJWFB6ZPEGW,630296928X,Toshifumi Fujiwara,"[57, 61]","Jean Renoir, after spending almost a decade in Hollywood struggling to establish an independent filmmaker staus, went to India. As it must have been for Renoir himself, THE RIVER is a breath of fresh air to its audience, which still holds a singular unique place in cinema.Based on Rummer Godden's autobiographical novel on her childhood spend on the bank of the Gandhis River, the film explores a radically poetic narrative which depends neither on a plot, nor driven with strong characters. It is really a visual poem. It doesn't ""describe"" anything, in preference to capture (as well as to create) a certain atmosphere, in eccense a whole universe of a certain life, beeing ""felt"".Though its aim was radical, and so were the mise-en-scene strategies taken by Renoir which were very unusual back then and even so today --especially the use of colors, that Renoir with his art director Eugene Lourie often walked around the sets and locations with cans of paint--, the film itself is very gentle, inviting the audience to share this idylic, magical, almost mystical universe of childhood.The majority of the cast were non-actors, and the entire film was shot on location, including many shots taken in documentaristic situations showing the indeginious life surrounding the river.At the same time, Renoir altered his location settings tremendously, both phisically (akmost re-painting everything) and cinematically (the two housese at the center of the story was actually one house that they rented). The story line itself often blends the ""real life"" aspects and the fantasy, not contrasting each other, or not even moving freely from one another; they just co-exist throughout the entire story.And this approach is totally justified, for the ambition of the film is not to create a faithful representation of Indian life, nor to present a ""post-card"" exotic touristic vision through European eyes (as many runnaway production shot in foreign landscape does). If the film is faithfull to something, it is above all faithful to the childhood experience, how a child would have felt. Though the protagonist family is a British one, at least for the children India is not a ""foreign"" land: it is their home. And that is the atmosphere, the feeling of this entire film, of a childhood memory in which there were really no distinction between the reality and the imagination.THE RIVER is a key film in Renoir's career moving from ""reality"" to ""inner truth"", from  the naturalism and social realism of his 30's films to the theatrical atrificially and satyrically enhanced realites that are presented in Criterion's DVD edition of ""STAGE AND SPECTACLE"". Because of this transitional nature, and the adventurous, experimental attitudes he was able to take thanks to the difficult production conditions, it may be a film in which he could be the truest to his feelings, to his aesthetics, to his sensitivities.Making this film in such a remote location, or just financing this project considered to be odd in the view of the industry (after all, it vitually has no plot devices, and Jean's determination of not using stars), was extremely difficult. The producer that he found, Ken McEldowney (whose interview can be seen as one of the supplements), was not a film producer, but a successfull florist and real estate businessman. While shooting in Technicolor required a lot of electricity for lightings and such, it was nearly impossible to get enough supply of that in India back then. They had to bring their own generator, which in turn made a lot of noize, when Renoir liked to shoot with direct sound as much as possible. To create the camera movements which give the film an extraordinary floating feel was yet another difficulty the filmmakers had to face, for the film was shot in three-strips Technicolor process which offers thick, subtle, nuanced and beautiful color pallette, but in turn its camera was so huge and heavy.But as you will see on this DVD, featuring a High-Def transfer from a magnificently restored film elements, the result that they achieved is......I won't say stunning, that doesn't sound appropreate for THE RIVER. The Technicolor process is often mistaken that it provides strong, lush colors that pop up to the ey, which is not true (it was just that the majority of Technicolor photographed films used sets, costumes and make-ups emphasising on primary colors). It's color is deep, more subtle, actually far more faithful to reality than the monopack processes (such as Eastmancolor). The effects of THE RIVER to its audience is gentle, absorbing, and beautifully poetic.Watching THE RIVER is not to be captivated by a story, or strong outstanding characters, or what ever you might expect from a movie. It is to be absorved in a whole atmosphere and feel it, experience it, maybe dreaming it.Martin Scorsese also offers a video introduction to the film. Obviously the film has influenced his works a great deal, especially the use of colors, of the rythm. Scorsese, especially in his recent films, also always try to capture an atmosphere, and not neccessary to ""tell the story"". He certainly wants to make a film like THE RIVER, and the closest achievement of his so far must be KUNDUN, which is also a visual poem which aim was really to recreate a whole atmosphere of

348088,A1QIL7847ET6HX,630296928X,xxgrendelxx,"[2, 3]","If I had seen Renoir's ""The River"" prior to viewing Wes Anderson's ""The Darjeeling Limited I may have written this piece much earlier and been just slightly less impressed with Anderson's film. As it is, I've only just finished watching ""The River"" and I'm pleased that my own previous ignorance left me to enjoy Wes's film all by itself.I was already a fan of Renoir's classic ""Grand Illusion"" when I read that Martin Scorsese had recommended 'The River"" and screened it for Anderson before he shot his India film, and so, having already seen ""Darjeeling..."", I was impressed with Scorsese's opinion and fascinated by the prospect of another Renoir film I hadn't seen. I wanted to see where Wes was coming from.Well, I have not been disappointed, and I don't think you will be either. Not only is ""The Darjeeling Limited"" a tribute as beautiful as ""The River"" to India and an lovely exploration of human notions of existence, but it is in fact the brother to it's sister film ""The River"".I am already familiar with both Hindu and Taoist perceptions of existence: of human life as an extension of the natural world and it's gentle rhythms and happier when it follows that ebb and flow, as I am also familiar with the criticisms of traditional Western perceptions, partcularly the overwhelmingly masculine facets of those perceptions regarding machinery as a solution to human problems and as an object of reverence.That women have it within their souls to more easily follow the natural way of life as men find it more to their preference to master it and control it is, I find, self evident. The most simple archetypal example of what I mean is that of the mother-gardener versus that of the father-mechanic (both of whom I've lived with, incidentally). Both Anderson and Renoir would seem to agree as is apparent in their films respectively.""The River"" is not only filled verbally with this gentle and simple philosophy but it also portrays this through it's characters, characters who despite living closer to nature and their river (the film's natural and therefore feminine metaphor for existence) are troubled by their passions and desires simply because they are human. These motives are mainly portrayed as empricially pure, though potent enough to create discord, and so allow the film to offer it's message without delving into crassness for sensationalism's sake to maintain the audience's interest.""The River"", with it's apparent absence of a cohesive plot and composition of episodic vignettes, is clearly the forerunner of the modern so-called ""chick-flick"" and because of this I find it no surprise how many detractors the movie has among male reviewers here and at IMDB. The ""chick-flick"" has taken abuse for often being trite, vapid and directionless, but how many films aimed at a male audience have been pretentious, self-righteous and contrived? The feminine cinematic format has been developed over the last three decades, sometimes well - sometimes not, but here in it's pure form it is honest, clear and beautiful. It does not matter that it's creator was a man, Jean Renoir; some of the most masculine films have been produced by women such as Gale Anne Hurd.Where irony peeps in is in that Renoir, a most masculine fellow, created this most feminine film - yet a sensitive director like Anderson created ""The River""'s very male-oriented counterpart in his ""The Darjeeling Limited"".""The Darjeeling Limited""'s existence has it's foundations in it's imagery and metaphors: In Anderson's film the metaphor for life is a train, a man-made machine whose direction and course, unlike the river in ""The River"", is directed and controlled in the main by men. That it gets lost from time to time is simply nature's way of affirming itself.""The River"" focuses on the lives of three fresh and enthusiastic young women, all virgins and strangers to romantic love, while ""Darjeeling...""'s protagonists are three brothers who are worldly and jaded. In this we have a sense of society's expected form regarding men and women: that women should be fresh, bright and unspoiled and men should be serious and experienced. Both ideals are in evidence as their stories unfold in either film.Each film portrays it's characters in opposite scenarios: The girls are stationary in ""The River""', seeking yet land-bound. The brothers in ""The Darjeeling Limited"" are constantly mobile, in fact, they are all presumed to take flight at the crisis point. Here, again, we find the dichotomy of male and female clearly shown.As for India, being used in each film as a place where spirituality is more concurrent with everday life than anywhere else, we find the young women already residing there in ""The River"" - that is, having grown with the natural and spiritual they are part of it. They grow with it at an even pace, a natural and feminine notion. In ""The Darjeeling Limited"" the brothers are strangers to India, they have no clear idea how to access the spirituality there, so they blunder about and 'go through the motions' until it 'works' for them, a most masculine notion where religion, 're ligio' - 'linking back' in Latin, linking back to the All - Nature, is concerned.The male of our species often feels cut off and separate from the natural world and it's tides, more so than women whose lives are tied inextricably to it's rhythms, and so in Anderson's film the men are simply tourists at first until they are confronted by death, a death which makes their being there in India all too real and poignant. It is death that ties them then to life, and they grow spiritually.A centerpoint in either film is the cobra and death. True to the nature of masculine and feminine in each film respectively, death is simply an event that occurs during the course of ""The River"", as natural a thing as living though grievous, while in ""The Darjeeling Limited"" it is a catastrophically defining moment that shakes it's protagonists to their cores and stalls their worlds until, through the catharsis of mourning and the male-defining element of purposeful action in defiance of death and nature, they continue on their life-paths and face the source of their pain (the absence of their mother). In each film the notion is portrayed with genius and sensitivity with complete sincerety.There are, of course, many elements in each film that are their own and entirely original. The notion of carrying around ""baggage"" is central to Anderson's film and it's most wonderful and defining moment is when the brother's leave it behind and get on with their lives, just as surely the most sincerely beautiful moment in ""The River"" is when the youngest girl (also the film's narrator), having at last drawn socially even with her sister, reveals that the profound wisdom she has just been offered by the object of her affection, a young maimed army captain, is something she has heard before - from her toddler sister!Just marvelous and beautiful ...In today's American society the lines that have stood drawn for thousands of years between the sexes and their roles have been blurred, as has the knowledge of the masculine and feminine nature of things and places and existence itself. Each film explores this. In ""The River"" this nature is self-evident. ""The Darjeeling Limited"" delves into these notions much more self-consciously, as it should, having come after Renoir's film and also in that much of the masculine nature of life is almost reactionary to existence - that is, the world could go on much the same without the male of the species here to enforce his will and attempt to change the course of rivers and trains.I don't know what draws people to India, what draws Western foreigners. I am drawn to India. Not perhaps, to the worldly India, the India of industry, tourism and politics, but to the India that has clearly so much to offer in terms of an empirical sense of truth: truth in religion, truth in spirituality, truth in existence itself.When life has been stripped down to essentials, asceticism remains. Perhaps only in India is this emulated, admired and adored and maybe this is why men of the West are drawn there, to a place where a life without frills may still function.I don't think it would really make a difference to either film if they were set in an imaginary land, but the locations of either film would have to be places where personal judgement is suspended and lessened by humiltiy, where the modern and the ancient live side by side almost to the point of timelessness, where community in it's most abstract sense is felt in the soul if not always in the head and heart.Watch them both. Watch them each with someone of the opposite sex. Both films are not only beautiful but works of genius: sincere and lyrical and full of simple truth and gentle humor.",5,"DUAL REVIEW: ANDERSON'S ""THE DARJEELING LIMITED"" AND ""THE
