551808,AVWV1C6ASEQ3B,B00004U5K5,Area88,"[1, 1]","Birth also known as Planet Busters or The World of Talisma, due to previous English dubs from Harmony Gold and Streamline pictures on VHS. This is a 1984 anime and is credited with being the very first direct to video released in Japan. Luckily ADV released this from the remastered Japanese print used on the R2 DVD release and the results are stunning. The colours literally jump off the screen.The back story is Aqualoid was once a prosperous planet, but an attack from a mysterious life force, the Inorganics, transformeed it into a post-apocalyptic shell of its former self. When Nam finds a mysterious sword, he is suddenly the object of a planet-wide chase. With the Inorganics closing in, will Nam and his friends discover the secret of the sword and save their world? Or will they destroy Aqualoid in favor of a new Birth?Birth was an ambitious, high production, experiment and is a must for any fan of vintage animation. The story is actually pretty good, it just takes time for it to unfold. At 80 minutes it's defintly worth picking up a copy up for a couple of dollars. One of the most memorable scenes is right at the end when the characters are in space and they talk to these deity beings about the meaning of life, only you hear no dialogue because human ears are not evolved enough to understand it yet.Rating - A",5,Birth - The Very First 1984 OVA - Planet Busters is Back on DVD!,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,1331,"['Birth', 'also', 'known', 'Planet', 'Busters', 'World', 'Talisma', 'due', 'previous', 'English', 'dubs', 'Harmony', 'Gold', 'Streamline', 'pictures', 'VHS', '1984', 'anime', 'credited', 'being', 'very', 'first', 'direct', 'video', 'released', 'Japan', 'Luckily', 'ADV', 'released', 'remastered', 'Japanese', 'print', 'used', 'R2', 'DVD', 'release', 'results', 'are', 'stunning', 'colours', 'literally', 'jump', 'off', 'screen.The', 'back', 'story', 'Aqualoid', 'was', 'once', 'prosperous', 'planet', 'attack', 'mysterious', 'life', 'force', 'Inorganics', 'transformeed', 'post-apocalyptic', 'shell', 'former', 'self', 'When', 'Nam', 'mysterious', 'sword', 'suddenly', 'object', 'planet-wide', 'chase', 'Inorganics', 'closing', 'will', 'Nam', 'friends', 'discover', 'secret', 'sword', 'save', 'world', 'will', 'destroy', 'Aqualoid', 'favor', 'new', 'Birth', 'Birth', 'was', 'ambitious', 'high', 'production', 'experiment', 'must', 'fan', 'vintage', 'animation', 'story', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'just', 'time', 'unfold', '80', 'minutes', 'defintly', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'copy', 'up', 'couple', 'dollars', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'right', 'end', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'space', 'talk', 'deity', 'beings', 'meaning', 'life', 'only', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'human', 'ears', 'are', 'not', 'evolved', 'enough', 'understand', 'yet.Rating', 'A']",Planet Busters VHS
551809,A2BJJ6MKIC1ZZ1,B00004U5K5,"James F. Neel ""Jemcollector""","[0, 2]","As now all-too-often, Amazon has mixed-up reviews for what are really TWO different products, the VHS tape of Planet Busters, and the DVD of Birth.  ""But wait!"" you say: ""Aren't they the SAME thing?""  Of course, the answer is a resounding NO!  Originating in the mid-1980's, Birth is a sloppily realized, overlong ( 85 min. according to the package ), seemingly unending chase between a tiny group of humanoids and their evidently robotic pursuers, termed ""inorganics""; Planet Busters was the commercial attempt to salvage this mess through editing, rewriting, and dubbing for U.S. television.  Unlike several of the reviewers here, I never saw the truncated TV version, so will confine my comments to the original.Supposedly the creators ran out of money and were unable to finish Birth, leaving an unsatisfying attempt to tell a story about the death of one civilization sundered by some long-ago holocaust, and the rebirth that transports the characters apparantly unscathed into some unknown but presumably better future.  Unfortunately the metaphor for this transition is one long and relentless ""chase scene"".  If you watch this strictly to enjoy the rapidly-changing moonscapes, both literal and figurative ( the planet's inhospitable and now-largely uninhabitable surface, AND the main girl character Rasa's ""Jiggly-Butt"", as it's termed by her pursuers ) this has a lot of individual features to recommend it.  Character designs ( in addition to the aforementioned posterior ) are good overall, and most of the action which makes up far too much of this is at least fluid and well-done, considering this is by now approaching its third decade.  I especially liked Rasa and her strange flying ""disc"", but once it's smashed, though the chase goes on things lose a lot of interest.Unfortunately, most of the dialog, such as it is, goes to the annoying Bao Lutzen, a would-be trader somewhat ""borrowed"" from Han Solo, in situation at least.  He's the kind of ""lecherous older-men"" characters popular around the time Birth was made, with a whiney, grumbling  vocal delivery somewhat like that of Lupin III. ( Of course I'm speaking of the original Japanese seyuu; as expressed elsewhere, the dub of this is too atrocious to bother with, though the stereo sound is worlds better. )  Other characters are more sympathetic, if too-bland, like Rasa's brother the would-be swordsman Nam, whose ""magic"" weapon is strangely ineffective.  Oddly, the trio of pursuers and their acolyte hanger-on appear much more interesting and all-too-human. Eventually they're replaced by ever-bigger ""inorganics"" who are mere monolithic giant robots totally devoid of personality.  Matters are scarcely helped by the occasional scene shifts back to the siblings' oblivious Grandparents having tea, unless it's just for a rest from the frenetic action of the chase.  Birth is not entirely without merit - it just quickly outwears its welcome with its seemingly endless rush to oblivion.",2,An Unending Chase,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,2967,"['now', 'all-too-often', 'Amazon', 'mixed-up', 'reviews', 'what', 'are', 'really', 'TWO', 'different', 'products', 'VHS', 'tape', 'Planet', 'Busters', 'DVD', 'Birth', 'wait', 'say', 'Are', ""n't"", 'SAME', 'thing', 'course', 'answer', 'resounding', 'NO', 'Originating', 'mid-1980', 'Birth', 'sloppily', 'realized', 'overlong', '85', 'min', 'according', 'package', 'seemingly', 'unending', 'chase', 'tiny', 'group', 'humanoids', 'evidently', 'robotic', 'pursuers', 'termed', 'inorganics', 'Planet', 'Busters', 'was', 'commercial', 'attempt', 'salvage', 'mess', 'editing', 'rewriting', 'dubbing', 'U.S.', 'television', 'several', 'reviewers', 'here', 'never', 'saw', 'truncated', 'TV', 'version', 'so', 'will', 'confine', 'comments', 'original.Supposedly', 'creators', 'ran', 'money', 'were', 'unable', 'finish', 'Birth', 'leaving', 'unsatisfying', 'attempt', 'tell', 'story', 'death', 'one', 'civilization', 'sundered', 'long-ago', 'holocaust', 'rebirth', 'characters', 'apparantly', 'unscathed', 'unknown', 'presumably', 'better', 'future', 'Unfortunately', 'metaphor', 'transition', 'one', 'long', 'relentless', 'chase', 'scene', 'watch', 'strictly', 'enjoy', 'rapidly-changing', 'moonscapes', 'literal', 'figurative', 'planet', 'inhospitable', 'now-largely', 'uninhabitable', 'surface', 'main', 'girl', 'character', 'Rasa', 'Jiggly-Butt', 'termed', 'pursuers', 'lot', 'individual', 'features', 'recommend', 'Character', 'designs', 'addition', 'aforementioned', 'posterior', 'are', 'good', 'overall', 'most', 'action', 'up', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'least', 'fluid', 'well-done', 'considering', 'now', 'approaching', 'third', 'decade', 'especially', 'liked', 'Rasa', 'strange', 'flying', 'disc', 'smashed', 'chase', 'things', 'lose', 'lot', 'interest.Unfortunately', 'most', 'dialog', 'such', 'annoying', 'Bao', 'Lutzen', 'would-be', 'trader', 'somewhat', 'borrowed', 'Han', 'Solo', 'situation', 'least', 'kind', 'lecherous', 'older-men', 'characters', 'popular', 'time', 'Birth', 'was', 'made', 'whiney', 'grumbling', 'vocal', 'delivery', 'somewhat', 'Lupin', 'III', 'course', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'original', 'Japanese', 'seyuu', 'expressed', 'elsewhere', 'dub', 'too', 'atrocious', 'bother', 'stereo', 'sound', 'worlds', 'better', 'Other', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'too-bland', 'Rasa', 'brother', 'would-be', 'swordsman', 'Nam', 'magic', 'weapon', 'strangely', 'ineffective', 'Oddly', 'trio', 'pursuers', 'acolyte', 'hanger-on', 'appear', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'all-too-human', 'Eventually', ""'re"", 'replaced', 'ever-bigger', 'inorganics', 'who', 'are', 'mere', 'monolithic', 'giant', 'robots', 'totally', 'devoid', 'personality', 'Matters', 'are', 'scarcely', 'helped', 'occasional', 'scene', 'shifts', 'back', 'siblings', 'oblivious', 'Grandparents', 'having', 'tea', 'just', 'rest', 'frenetic', 'action', 'chase', 'Birth', 'not', 'entirely', 'merit', 'just', 'quickly', 'welcome', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'rush', 'oblivion']",Planet Busters VHS
551810,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B00004U5K5,Sesho,"[2, 4]","Back in the old days, lots of anime was made to satisfy the eyeballs of otaku fanboys with a lot of visual fluff but they mostly lacked plot and characterization. Such is the case with the oldschool feature, Birth. During some of the more action-packed sequences, you can almost sense that 20 years ago, people in Japan were ooing and awwing over the still somewhat impressive animation without worrying about having good characters.The lifeforce of the  Universe has become unbalanced which has led to the appearance of a race of Inorganics (robots?) whose sole mission is to eradicate the Organics (humans) from all worlds. Thats when a mysterious flying sword, named SHADE, shows up. Supposedly, it is the key to destroying the cancerous spread of the Inorganics. A human named Nam comes upon it as he is riding a giant chicken-like beast and claims it for his own. Unluckily for him, the Inorganics know about SHADE too, and will stop at nothing to obtain it. Nam is helped in his quest to understand the nature of SHADE by his shapely ladyfriend, Rasa, and a lecherous spaceship captain and copilot, and an annoying little glob whose only speech is the word ""Munga!"".If you like old school anime that has a lot of storm and fury but little substance in the style of MegaZone 23 you will love this anime. After you finish watching it, you feel as though sitting through it was a pointless exercise. Most of the characters lives revolve around driving around. I mean, what do these people do for a living? The music is your standard cheesy 80s electronic keyboard music. I will admit that for being such an old anime, the animation is pretty good. The Japanese voice acting was pretty average or below average, especially the always yelling spaceship captain. I haven't listened to all of the 5.1 English dub but what little I have is preferrable to the Japanese.
