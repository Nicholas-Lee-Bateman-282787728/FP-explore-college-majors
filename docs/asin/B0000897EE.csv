736527,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B0000897EE,A Customer,"[2, 2]","Summary:Marisa Ventura (Jennifer Lopez) is a single mother and a hard-working maid in an upscale New York hotel.  Her son, Ty (Tyler Posey), whose father tends to miss all of the most important things in his life, just happens to be fascinated with politics.  When 'Chris' Marshall (Ralph Fiennes), a New York politician/playboy running for re-election, moves temporarily into the hotel where Marisa is working there doesn't seem to be a problem.  Until, Marisa, coaxed by a friend, decides to put on the $5,000 suit of one of the hotel guests and is caught by her son, who has befriended Chris by talking politics and petting his dog, and Chris.  Chris immediately falls for Marisa and invites her to go walk his dog with him and Ty.In their brief walk both realize that they could pursue this relationship further.  That would be fine except Chris believes Marisa is a very wealthy guest at the hotel and not one of the maids.  What's more, Marisa has just been made a supervisor and is in a precarious position where any wrong move could ruin her career.  Well, her wrong move is eventually caught and the tower of cards fantasy relationship with Chris comes tumbling down along with her career dreams.  But apparently love knows no economic or racial/ethnic boundaries and despite the deception Chris finds himself so in love with Marisa that he looks past the lie.My Comments:The movie is kind of cute and really plays on the idea that romance can cross economic class boundaries.  It's very much the Cinderella story played out in a posh Manhattan hotel with very few real changes to the story.  Caroline Lane (Natasha Richardson), who reveals the lie to Chris, could be compared to Cinderella's stepsisters or stepmother; her friends, the other maids, would be the mice and others that help her get all dressed up, etc.  So, the movie has some very classic elements.There were, however, two things about the movie that bothered.  First, despite actually being okay in this role, I still don't think Jennifer Lopez is a great actress.  What makes this movie an exception is that she isn't really doing that much acting.  She is Hispanic and has made it big because of her looks.  Of course, in the movie they try to make it out as though her success is because of her hard-work and no-nonsense attitude, but what attracts Chris is the fact that she's, well, attractive.  Chances are he wouldn't have fallen for her friend, who wasn't nearly as attractive, if he had found her dressed up.  So, the problem here is that Jennifer Lopez wasn't acting - she was just being Jennifer Lopez.The other thing about the movie that bothers me is the Cinderella fantasy.  The more I think about this fantasy the more disgusted I become.  The majority of relationships and marriages in the U.S. are between people of similar economic backgrounds.  Sure, there are those select few, but to dream about that happening is really pretty much beyond being a dream, it's a fantasy.  This type of movie, building on the Cinderella story, is a lie and encourages poor young women to believe that something like this could actually happen.  Now, I recognize that I'm being a bit harsh, after all there are those special cases.  But I just don't see it as healthy to maintain dreams of being whisked away by some Prince Charming with millions of dollars.  In other words, the basic premise of the movie is a very uncommon occurrence - don't get your hopes up because it isn't going to happen to you.Couple of other things... Ralph Fiennes was pretty good.  I like him as an actor.  He can play unique roles (see Red Dragon) and is pretty convincing.  So, that was a positive for the movie.  The other thing that is really standing out in my mind is, Why did Ty freeze up on his speech at the beginning of the movie?  Was this supposed to be some character arc for him that he found a father-like figure in Chris and was finally able to speak in public again?  The resolution of the 'problem' was kind of cute, but the setup was pretty illogical, especially considering how interested he was in politics and knowing that giving speeches is an important part of that.Overall, the movie is really just Cinderella transported to New York and incorporating ethnic differences into the mix.  It isn't a romantic comedy because it isn't really funny, Stanley Tucci is about the only person that pushes for laughs.  I guess if you don't mind believing in something that is more than likely not going to happen you might enjoy this movie.  I must admit that the finished product isn't too bad, but I don't like the message and I've never liked Jennifer Lopez as an actress.",2,Cute but a lie,1055721600,"06 16, 2003",2003,4646,"['Summary', 'Marisa', 'Ventura', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'single', 'mother', 'hard-working', 'maid', 'upscale', 'New', 'York', 'hotel', 'son', 'Ty', 'Tyler', 'Posey', 'father', 'miss', 'most', 'important', 'things', 'life', 'just', 'be', 'fascinated', 'politics', 'When', ""'Chris"", 'Marshall', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'New', 'York', 'politician/playboy', 'running', 're-election', 'moves', 'temporarily', 'hotel', 'where', 'Marisa', 'working', 'there', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'problem', 'Marisa', 'coaxed', 'friend', 'put', '5,000', 'suit', 'one', 'hotel', 'guests', 'caught', 'son', 'who', 'befriended', 'Chris', 'talking', 'politics', 'petting', 'dog', 'Chris', 'Chris', 'immediately', 'Marisa', 'go', 'walk', 'dog', 'Ty.In', 'brief', 'walk', 'realize', 'could', 'pursue', 'relationship', 'further', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'Chris', 'Marisa', 'very', 'wealthy', 'guest', 'hotel', 'not', 'one', 'maids', 'What', 'more', 'Marisa', 'just', 'been', 'made', 'supervisor', 'precarious', 'position', 'where', 'wrong', 'move', 'could', 'ruin', 'career', 'Well', 'wrong', 'move', 'eventually', 'caught', 'tower', 'cards', 'fantasy', 'relationship', 'Chris', 'tumbling', 'down', 'along', 'career', 'dreams', 'apparently', 'love', 'economic', 'racial/ethnic', 'boundaries', 'deception', 'Chris', 'so', 'love', 'Marisa', 'lie.My', 'Comments', 'movie', 'kind', 'cute', 'really', 'plays', 'idea', 'romance', 'can', 'cross', 'economic', 'class', 'boundaries', 'very', 'much', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'played', 'out', 'posh', 'Manhattan', 'hotel', 'very', 'few', 'real', 'changes', 'story', 'Caroline', 'Lane', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'who', 'lie', 'Chris', 'could', 'be', 'compared', 'Cinderella', 'stepsisters', 'stepmother', 'friends', 'other', 'maids', 'would', 'be', 'mice', 'others', 'help', 'get', 'dressed', 'up', 'etc', 'So', 'movie', 'very', 'classic', 'elements.There', 'were', 'however', 'two', 'things', 'movie', 'bothered', 'First', 'actually', 'being', 'okay', 'role', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'great', 'actress', 'What', 'movie', 'exception', ""n't"", 'really', 'doing', 'much', 'acting', 'Hispanic', 'made', 'big', 'looks', 'course', 'movie', 'try', 'make', 'out', 'success', 'hard-work', 'no-nonsense', 'attitude', 'what', 'Chris', 'fact', 'well', 'attractive', 'Chances', 'are', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'fallen', 'friend', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'attractive', 'had', 'found', 'dressed', 'up', 'So', 'problem', 'here', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez.The', 'other', 'thing', 'movie', 'bothers', 'Cinderella', 'fantasy', 'more', 'think', 'more', 'disgusted', 'become', 'majority', 'relationships', 'marriages', 'U.S.', 'are', 'people', 'similar', 'economic', 'backgrounds', 'Sure', 'are', 'select', 'few', 'dream', 'happening', 'really', 'pretty', 'much', 'being', 'dream', 'fantasy', 'type', 'movie', 'building', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'lie', 'poor', 'young', 'women', 'believe', 'something', 'could', 'actually', 'happen', 'Now', 'recognize', ""'m"", 'being', 'bit', 'harsh', 'are', 'special', 'cases', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'healthy', 'maintain', 'dreams', 'being', 'whisked', 'away', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'millions', 'dollars', 'other', 'words', 'basic', 'premise', 'movie', 'very', 'uncommon', 'occurrence', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', 'up', ""n't"", 'going', 'happen', 'you.Couple', 'other', 'things', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'like', 'actor', 'can', 'play', 'unique', 'roles', 'see', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'So', 'was', 'positive', 'movie', 'other', 'thing', 'really', 'standing', 'out', 'mind', 'Why', 'did', 'Ty', 'freeze', 'up', 'speech', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Was', 'supposed', 'be', 'character', 'arc', 'found', 'father-like', 'figure', 'Chris', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'speak', 'public', 'again', 'resolution', ""'problem"", 'was', 'kind', 'cute', 'setup', 'was', 'pretty', 'illogical', 'especially', 'considering', 'how', 'interested', 'was', 'politics', 'knowing', 'giving', 'speeches', 'important', 'part', 'that.Overall', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'Cinderella', 'transported', 'New', 'York', 'incorporating', 'ethnic', 'differences', 'mix', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'really', 'funny', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'only', 'person', 'laughs', 'guess', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'believing', 'something', 'more', 'likely', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'might', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'must', 'admit', 'finished', 'product', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'message', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'actress']",N/A

I would rather sit alone for six hours staring at a pine tree than give an hour and a half-plus to a nightmarish meet-cute. Thankfully, in this very manly reviewers opinion, Maid in Manhattan shines a little.Jennifer Lopez is accredited to acting in one of the grandest modern bombs of our time. The mention of the word sends chills up the spine, but here it goes: Gigli. (Which according to Ebert didn't deserve the negative attention it got. Though he thumbs-downed it.) I say that to say this, Jennifer Lopez ain't bad. I am no fan of her music, but as I have said many times - to each his own -  but she's not too bad at acting. In Maid, she holds her own as a mother trying to balance time with her son and trying to hold her head up through her work situation.There are a few scenes which on their own stand out. No major spoilers to worry about. The first is the moment where she confronts her own mother about raising her to believe that she's just a stupid chicano that can't achieve goals higher than cleaning. I also liked the supportive comradery between all the Maids. Also, Mr Fiennes shows his acting abilities beyond the sadistic jew killer in Schindlers list. Yes, he has proven it many times, but after the latest Harry Potter, he reaffirmed his strength in personifying evil.I am giving this movie a good review for those of you who have a guy whom you would rather not torture, and can appreciate a good chic flick.

The hunky Fiennes walks in and becomes smitten, believing the lie that Lopez in, indeed, the socialite.  They start dating (kind of) while Lopez continues the improbably ruse to distract him from the truth about her `day job'.  Of course he's going to find out sooner or later, and they'll have that standard ""you lied to me"" routine where you think for a brief moment that they won't end up together and then BAM out of nowhere (sarcasm) they wind up together.Yeah, that's pretty much the movie in a nutshell.I'm not for certain that Fiennes is the best choice for a romantic comedy leading man.  He is far too proper to really sell the humor in this story.  That said, he plays his `character' well, if his character were in a dramatic film.  Lopez is nearly always charming, even when her films are not (well, unless she is plotting revenge on an abusive husband).  She soars here, as expected, and so I'll give her that.It must be stated thought, that as good as Lopez is, this film kind of BELONGS to Bob Hoskins and Stanley Tucci.If you like an ample dose of preposterousness mixed with predictability in your comedy, then this film will fit the bill.

The minor characters are all great, though none achieve the level of comedy you feel they are capable of reaching.

You'd think this would ruin every movie she's in for me, but actually I have ended up seeing them all at one time or another.  Despite her rather obnoxious real-life persona, J Lo is strangely compelling on screen.  In this particular movie, she is perfectly cast and does a great job as Marissa, the struggling single mom and hotel maid with ambitions toward a career as manager.If you are unaware of the plot, all I have to say is that this is the Cinderella story as it would have been written in the 21st Century.  Happily, the ""evil stepsisters"" idea is replaced with a genuine bond of sisterhood between Marissa and the other maids.  Marissa does have a mom that's keeping her down with negative thinking and her own personal demons, but even this character is not a one-dimensional villain.  As for the handsome prince, well, he's a Senator with an overbearing staff that he'd rather escape from most of the timeSo anyway, now that you know that I have not rated this movie four stars because I'm a rabid J.Lo fan, let's take a look at why I do like it:As mentioned, decent acting all aroundA few unconventional characters, like Marissa's friend/partner who has more spunk than is usually allowed for an older woman, much less a maidClassic chick flick plot (I qualify as a chick, so that makes sense) that is emotional without being sappyHonest look at a benind-the-scenes world of the hotel business that I thought was fascinating in itselfMaid in Manhattan is enjoyable despite having a somewhat predictable plot.

That's the thing that keeps me coming to the theater.The cheesy ""makeover"" scene and the scene where she walks into the ballroom decked out in the great dress, though complete cliches, are highlights.In this, though, her luminous beauty and charisma can't hold up the film. First off, she has no chemistry with Ralph Fiennes, who looks downright uncomfortable both as an uppity American and as someone falling in love with Lopez. Her best scenes are with the child actor playing her son. There aren't nearly enough of those scenes.The ending, as well, is a letdown. She loses the promotion, her job, her man for a couple months. Certainly, there's a turnaround in which she somewhat comes out on top, but the movie doesn't fully recover from its dramatic climax.And those magazine covers in the film are terrible.

When I saw Jennifer Lopez, I started watching and was hooked from the first scene with her little son. I just finished it and must say I truly enjoyed the time spent watching this ""feel-good"" movie. It was just what the doctor ordered after a two-day stint with the flu.  This certainly went well with my recuperative fare of tea and toast.  ... lol ...In this movie, Lopez plays--you guessed it!--a maid who works in  a top-flight hotel in Manhattan.Maid in Manhattanis a breezy romantic comedy where a rich, handsome, aspiring politician, played by Ralph Fiennes, falls for the maid. Drawn initially by her beauty, he soon comes to know her as an independent, honest woman ... a struggling single mother who puts her ten-year-old son above all else. Tyler Posey does a fine acting job as her son.Yes, this movie has ""shades of Cinderella,"" like many romance novels and movies, but it has differences in every twist and turn that conspire to keep this unlikely couple apart.  At first, because Lopez is dressed in a guest's clothing, Fiennes thinks she is a socialite herself; complications caused by that error lead to many hilarious situations, yet even more heart-wrenching ones.The sentimentality and romantic warmth of the movie are due to good performances by Lopez and Fiennes, but the supporting actors bring this movie to life.  You will be amused by Natasha Richardson and Amy Sedaris in the roles of callow socialites, Bob Hoskins as a dignified butler, and you'll love to hate Stanley Tucci as Fiennes's aggravating campaign manager.So how does the politician react when he learns his love interest is a maid? How does she take it? You guessed that they eventually get back together--don't they in all Cinderella stories?--but what happens before that transpires? And how does the maid's son react to all this?  Does he even like Fiennes's character?I promise you lots of laughs as you watch this movie and learn the answers to those questions and more.

Less than a year on from September 11th, audiences needed fairytale escapism, and this movie delivered it with an adorable Jennifer Lopez (then riding high on her dual career of actress and chart-topping pop singer) and a whimsical Norah Jones soundtrack.  Seven years later, does MAID IN MANHATTAN still hold it's entertaining spell?  Yes...Marisa Ventura (Jennifer Lopez) manages to juggle a hectic job of working as maid in the plush Beresford Hotel in New York with being a loving single mother to her 10-year-old son Ty (Tyler Garcia Posey).  One day whilst fooling around in the closet belonging to globe-trotting socialite Caroline Lane (Natasha Richardson), she happens to bump into political campaigner Christopher Marshall (Ralph Fiennes) and a warm friendship begins which soon turns into romance.  All the while hiding her true identity, Marisa teeters on the brink of losing her job--and a shot at landing a management position.  Will she risk it all for another chance at love?Lopez and Fiennes share a sleek chemistry; but Kevin Wade's screenplay oddly ends up following the supporting characters more closely and in greater depth than the leads.  The late, great Natasha Richardson plays the shallow, bubble-headed socialite to a tee; and Bob Hoskins has some wonderful scenes as the Beresford's veteran butler.

736556,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,B0000897EE,CodeMaster Talon,"[27, 33]","""Maid in Manhattan"" is the latest in what I presume will be a very long line of frothy J.Lo vehicles. Is it a great movie? Nope. Is it a good movie? Eh, kinda. Actuallty, it's pretty much a decent Saturday night date movie: no more, no less.The plot concerns the romantic entanglements of a maid (Lopez) working in an upscale New York hotel. She dreams of someday becoming a manager, which evidently no maid has ever done (that's America!). One day while cleaning out a suite, she is persuaded by a friend to try on the designer clothes of a wealthy guest. While wearing them she is spotted by a famous politician, also staying at the hotel. He assumes she's rich, she doesn't correct him, and we're off on the old ""mistaken identity"" plotline.I would say the screenplay for this movie is just slightly above average, with the characters slightly more fleshed out than we've come to expect from the Hollywood romances of today. The role of Lopez' gifted son in particular is both unusually well written and well played.The one true bright spot here is Ralph ""Call me Rafe"" Fiennes, playing the politician. He is just great in anything. This is a different kind of role for him: no tortured souls, no misery, just lightweight romance. He pulls it off very nicely.All in all, I would give this movie about a B- or a B ( I incline towards a straight B when remembering Fiennes). I didn't exactly laugh, but I did smile.

I'll watch mediocre, even bad ones, again and again. And I like Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fiennes. But I could not handle this movie.The plot holds some promise for the genre: wealthy Manhattan bachelor (Fiennes) mistakes NYC hotel maid (lopez) with cute son for guest.Yet I felt as if I could see the Hollywood blue print for this movie superimposed over every scene. Did you like Pretty Woman? Well  you'll have plenty of references-upscale bachelor and working girl, a scene where working girl/cinderella goes to ball, lots of clothes changes. Did you like WHen Harry Met Sally? Well you'll have references-Lopez and Fiennes walk side by side in Central Park a la Ryan and Crystal. Did you like Notting Hill? Well you have a big confessional press conference scene near the end (and Notting Hill's conference actually recalled Roman Holiday).Lopez does inject warmth and humanity in her role. Natasha Richardson is very funny in a small role. But Ralph Fiennes-and it breaks my heart to say this-is miscast. Richard Gere couldn't play some of his roles and vice versa.I would recommend this movie to individuals who need a quick fix of romantic comedy, not matter what the quality.

We can always use more of those.  No, I'm talking about another ""Cinderella tale,"" one that doesn't stray from the ancient plotline.  In the tradition of SABRINA, MY FAIR LADY, and PRETTY WOMAN, Jennifer Lopez gets the chance to wear the glass slippers in MAID IN MANHATTAN, a mildly entertaining amalgam of this genre.Of course, there are a few points of difference here.  Cinderella is sassy in her own way, working as a hotel maid who happens to have a rich senator fall in love with her while trying on some of her client's clothes.  What follows is an awkward romantic comedy in which the audience isn't quite sure why Cinderella puts up such a fight.  Of course, the Prince (Ralph Fiennes) does have some trouble finding her again, but he accomplishes this task rather early in the film.  Thus, we are left wondering why things are not falling into place.I agree with one reviewer: one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes when Cinderella is ""transformed"" from a common maid into an ""elegant"" princess.  Unfortunately, whoever did the makeup job on this film must have been drunk: Cinderella looked better before the makeover.  In fact, her makeup reminded me of some of the painted faces you see at a high school dance.  So, while it did have a ""realistic"" feel, we're supposed to be bowled over by Cinderella's beauty (and not shocked in horror).Anyway, if you want my recommendation, I'd say leave MAID IN MANHATTAN alone.  If you like romantic comedies, particularly the ones I mentioned, you may be mildly entertained by this film.  It does, in fact, have the acting talent to carry it.  But, for my dollar, it is of lesser quality than any of the three I mentioned.",2,"Nothing You Haven't Seen Already: Formulaic ""Cinderella"" Tale",1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,1792,"['Just', 'what', 'world', 'needed', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'movie', 'underdog', 'can', 'always', 'use', 'more', 'No', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Cinderella', 'tale', 'one', ""n't"", 'stray', 'ancient', 'plotline', 'tradition', 'SABRINA', 'MY', 'FAIR', 'LADY', 'PRETTY', 'WOMAN', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'chance', 'wear', 'glass', 'slippers', 'MAID', 'IN', 'MANHATTAN', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'amalgam', 'genre.Of', 'course', 'are', 'few', 'points', 'difference', 'here', 'Cinderella', 'sassy', 'own', 'way', 'working', 'hotel', 'maid', 'who', 'have', 'rich', 'senator', 'fall', 'love', 'trying', 'client', 'clothes', 'What', 'awkward', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'audience', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'Cinderella', 'up', 'such', 'fight', 'course', 'Prince', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'have', 'trouble', 'finding', 'again', 'task', 'rather', 'early', 'film', 'Thus', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'falling', 'place.I', 'agree', 'one', 'reviewer', 'one', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'movie', 'when', 'Cinderella', 'transformed', 'common', 'maid', 'elegant', 'princess', 'Unfortunately', 'whoever', 'did', 'makeup', 'job', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'drunk', 'Cinderella', 'looked', 'better', 'makeover', 'fact', 'makeup', 'reminded', 'painted', 'see', 'high', 'school', 'dance', 'So', 'did', 'have', 'realistic', 'feel', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'bowled', 'over', 'Cinderella', 'beauty', 'not', 'shocked', 'horror', '.Anyway', 'want', 'recommendation', ""'d"", 'say', 'leave', 'MAID', 'IN', 'MANHATTAN', 'alone', 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'particularly', 'ones', 'mentioned', 'may', 'be', 'mildly', 'entertained', 'film', 'fact', 'have', 'acting', 'talent', 'carry', 'dollar', 'lesser', 'quality', 'three', 'mentioned']",N/A

736563,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0000897EE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","In 2002, the romantic comedy ""Maid in Manhattan"" was a box office success.  #1 in the box office and earning over a $154 million worldwide.The film was directed by Wayne Wang (""The Joy Luck Club"", ""Last Holiday"", ""The Center of the World"") and a screenplay by Kevin Wade (""Meet Joe Black"", ""Working Girl"", ""Mr. Baseball"").  The film would feature cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub (""Georgia Rule"", ""Ninja Assasin"", ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"") and music by Alan Silvestri (""Beowulf"", ""Night at the Museum"", ""G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra"" and ""The Mummy"" films).VIDEO:""Maid in Manhattan"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  Having seen this film several times on DVD, I can tell you that the film looks vibrant on Blu-ray.  The New York City skyline looks absolutely beautiful in the background and with many colors throughout the film, once again Sony Pictures Home Entertainment does a great job with the transfer.  Skin tones are natural and Jennifer Lopez looks absolute beautiful.  Detail is much more evident during the hotel sequences but it's the scenes when they are outdoor and you see New York City, which I found to be beautiful.  It definitely caught my attention when I saw it on Blu-ray.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:Also, catching my attention this time around is the lossless audio.  The film is presented in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Thai and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Although the film is dialogue driven and audio is primarily front and center channel, I felt the music was really lively this time around.  Simon and Garfunkel's ""Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"" sounded pristine in lossless.  As for surround channel, there was not much being used (or was there a need for it) but did notice certain crowd scenes (primarily when Ty was giving his speech) and the reverb from the mic of the host of the speech night being heard through the surround channels.But for the most part, the lossless audio is satisfactory for this type of film.  Again, I found the lossless audio much more apparent now than I have ever experienced watching this film prior on DVD.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Korean, Thai, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified).SPECIAL FEATURES:""Maid in Manhattan"" comes with a single special feature in standard definition and in English stereo with Spanish, Chinese, Thai and Portuguese subtitles.* Blooper Reel - (7:31) Bloopers from ""Maid in Manhattan""* Trailers - Upcoming or available films on Blu-ray from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.JUDGMENT CALL:""Maid in Manhattan""is a delightful romantic comedy.  It's also my favorite film to feature Jennifer Lopez, who had come a long way since her appearance on ""Selena"" and ""Anaconda"".  But most importantly, I felt that the film was good timing at the theaters.  I remember watching this film (which went up against another romantic comedy ""Two Weeks Notice"" with Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock and also shot in NYC) a year after 9/11 and thinking how beautiful New York City looked and how appropriate it was to bring the NYC romantic comedy back on the big screen.I enjoyed the film for its lightheartedness and although not necessarily complex, just a fun romantic comedy to sit back, watch and enjoy.  Although, in a sense it is a fairytale romantic comedy along the same vein as ""Pretty Woman"", where Julia Roberts and Richard Gere had magnificent chemistry, although Lopez and Fiennes worked well together, I felt that the two didn't have the same type of magic.Overall, ""Maid in Manhattan"" is a simple but fun romantic comedy and for those who enjoyed the film on DVD, the beautiful visuals of the New York City skyline and hearing that Simon and Garfunkel music, all so clearly in lossless audio may be enough for you to upgrade.  The original DVD was a bit lackluster in special features, so at least people can see the blooper reel included.  It would have been nice to have an audio commentary or featurette to be included but at least there is something and it's not another barebones release.If you are looking for a romantic comedy film just in time for Valentines Day or just a big fan of the film or J.Lo, then ""Maid in Manhattan"" is definitely worth picking up on Blu-ray!",3,"Blu-ray: Delightful!

Von Behren ""reneofc""","[3, 5]","Where Julia Roberts has great success in her box office Cinderella story, 'Pretty Woman', Jennifer Lopez is less than successful.  I'm not saying that this is a bad movie---its cute, but its similarity to 'Pretty Woman' is almost text book and too convenient.J-lo is Marisa, a maid in a distinguished Manhattan hotel---she aspires to a management position and is motivated by her colleagues, and her son, Ty a young boy with a penchant for politics.  She's got two thorns in her side:  a mother who thinks management dreams are a waste of time and an ex-husband (who we don't see) who constantly disappoints Ty with his lack of involvement.  Enter Chris, young Anglo assemblyman played wonderfully and optimistically by Ralph Fiennes who when seeing Marisa dressed in a socialite's $5000 outfit assumes she is a guest at the hotel and becomes immediately interested.  J-lo keeps the facade going with some disastrous results and some funny moments with Natashia Richardson, as an over eager society woman, Bob Hoskins as the hotel's butler, and Stanely Tucci as Chris' PR man.What's really wrong the movie is that unlike Gere and Robert's unmistakable likeability and chemistry, Lopez and Fiennes do not seem to match.  Fiennes is charming; he plays his part with the same boyish charisma seen in 'Quiz Show'--the audience cannot help but respond.  Lopez, on the other hand, is too harried, Fiennes good looks and pleasant mannerisms simply do not seem to effect her---why I can't imagine---perhaps she was too intent on playing Marisa as too burdened by her life as a single mother to actually enjoy the intentions of a fabulously good looking man. Her actions don't match the lack of emotions she fails to convey.  She comes across as flat (except for the obvious), Chris's dog has more soul peeking through out of its brown eyes than she does.  The young actor who plays Ty is far more engaging but his attachment to Chris seems stretched as does Tucci's desire to utterly control Chris's personal life---in these two cases, the fault lies with the script and not the actors.  Sadly, Fiennes is wasted in this film, but kudos to him on a perfect performance with little or no help from the script or his leading lady.Recommended to those who simply love J-lo (?)

Rupert,"[1, 2]","Jennifer Lopez - ""Maid in Manhattan"" (Columbia, 2002)I watched this movie with my wife and although she liked it (perhaps because it truly is a ""chick flick""), I was a little disgusted by the predictability of the whole film. But there were redeeming moments that kept me from scoffing during the movie.You read the less-than-four-star reviews here and they're all accurate. The story starts when a maid named Marisa (Jennifer Lopez) notices cute politician Chris Marshall (played by Ralph Fiennes) while cleaning his hotel room. Chris and his publicist take the elevator down and run into a kid (Tyler Posley) who just happens to be Marisa's son, Ty. He was staying in the building because he had to come with Marisa to work due to his deadbeat father cancelling his plans with him. After being impressed with Ty's political views, Chris had to see his mother.Meanwhile, Marisa was cleaning a snobbish guest's vacant room and was peer-pressured by a co-worker to try on the guest's wardrobe. Chris and Ty walk into the room and see Marisa in the beautiful wardrobe. The co-worker tells Chris that Marisa's name is that of the guest who stays in that room; Marisa doesn't ""have time"" to tell him the truth as Chris takes her and her son out to kick it.You pretty much know what will happen from that point. Girl is told that she has to stop seeing him to protect her job (in this case, a promotion to management), girl tries to tell boy the truth about herself but gets interrupted by the boy telling his feelings to her, boy finds out the truth from someone else, girl is embarrassed (and fired for stealing a guest's clothes), girl gives the ol' ""you-wouldn't-like-me-if-I-told-you-the-truth-about-myself"" line, someone comes and convinces boy to take her back (Ty, the obligatory boy who has an adult brain), and boy gets the girl.But rewind a little bit to the ball where Marisa is invited to by Chris. Marisa is made-over into a beautiful woman but she only comes to tell Chris the truth. When spotted by the same guest she borrowed the clothes from, she splits while Chris chases her. This scene is so painfully Cinderella-esque that I was waiting for Marisa to leave a glass slipper.So why did I give this three stars instead of two? Because there are two interesting scenes; one is where Marisa confronts her friend for signing her up to become manager, and when Marisa and her co-workers start dancing before they help her find a dress for the ball. They dance to Diana Ross's ""I'm Coming Out"" (by the way, where did the music come from?).Overall, if you see the movie, you may not want to see it again because you saw it many times before, if you know what I mean. -EJR",3,"Wow, the only thing missing is the glass slipper",1049673600,"04 7, 2003",2003,2679,"['Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'Columbia', '2002', 'watched', 'movie', 'wife', 'liked', 'perhaps', 'truly', 'chick', 'flick', 'was', 'little', 'disgusted', 'predictability', 'whole', 'film', 'were', 'redeeming', 'moments', 'kept', 'scoffing', 'movie.You', 'read', 'less-than-four-star', 'reviews', 'here', ""'re"", 'accurate', 'story', 'when', 'maid', 'named', 'Marisa', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'notices', 'cute', 'politician', 'Chris', 'Marshall', 'played', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'cleaning', 'hotel', 'room', 'Chris', 'publicist', 'take', 'elevator', 'down', 'run', 'kid', 'Tyler', 'Posley', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'Marisa', 'son', 'Ty', 'was', 'staying', 'building', 'had', 'come', 'Marisa', 'work', 'due', 'deadbeat', 'father', 'cancelling', 'plans', 'being', 'impressed', 'Ty', 'political', 'views', 'Chris', 'had', 'see', 'mother.Meanwhile', 'Marisa', 'was', 'cleaning', 'snobbish', 'guest', 'vacant', 'room', 'was', 'peer-pressured', 'co-worker', 'try', 'guest', 'wardrobe', 'Chris', 'Ty', 'walk', 'room', 'see', 'Marisa', 'beautiful', 'wardrobe', 'co-worker', 'tells', 'Chris', 'Marisa', 'name', 'guest', 'who', 'room', 'Marisa', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'tell', 'truth', 'Chris', 'son', 'kick', 'it.You', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'point', 'Girl', 'told', 'stop', 'seeing', 'protect', 'job', 'case', 'promotion', 'management', 'girl', 'tries', 'tell', 'boy', 'truth', 'interrupted', 'boy', 'telling', 'feelings', 'boy', 'out', 'truth', 'someone', 'else', 'girl', 'embarrassed', 'fired', 'stealing', 'guest', 'clothes', 'girl', 'ol', ""you-wouldn't-like-me-if-I-told-you-the-truth-about-myself"", 'line', 'someone', 'convinces', 'boy', 'take', 'back', 'Ty', 'obligatory', 'boy', 'who', 'adult', 'brain', 'boy', 'girl.But', 'little', 'bit', 'ball', 'where', 'Marisa', 'invited', 'Chris', 'Marisa', 'made-over', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'only', 'tell', 'Chris', 'truth', 'When', 'spotted', 'same', 'guest', 'borrowed', 'clothes', 'Chris', 'scene', 'so', 'painfully', 'Cinderella-esque', 'was', 'waiting', 'Marisa', 'leave', 'glass', 'slipper.So', 'why', 'did', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'instead', 'two', 'are', 'two', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'one', 'where', 'Marisa', 'confronts', 'friend', 'signing', 'up', 'become', 'manager', 'when', 'Marisa', 'co-workers', 'start', 'dancing', 'help', 'find', 'dress', 'ball', 'dance', 'Diana', 'Ross', ""'m"", 'Coming', 'Out', 'way', 'where', 'did', 'music', 'come', '.Overall', 'see', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'saw', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'know', 'what', 'mean', '-EJR']",N/A

Hotel maid Marisa Ventura, played by Jennifer Lopez, is mistaken by U.S. Senate candidate Chris Marshall, played by Ralph Fiennes, for a rich socialite while trying on a wealthy woman's dress in a hotel room.  Romantic sparks fly between the two of them, while the fun and games ensue as Marisa desperately tries to keep up the pretence and overcome the obstacles that stand in the way of love finding its way between these two.  What makes things even more difficult is the fact that the press with their hordes of paparazzi and camera crews are continually in hot pursuit of Marshall.

I have somewhat mixed feelings about the movie caused primarily by the two leading characters in the movie. Ralph Fiennes played an important and well-known political candidate for the Senate who was on campaign. He inadvertently met up with Jenifer Lopez, who played a maid in a fancy NYC hotel, and they end up in a somewhat complicated relationship. Well, the acting of Fiennes was unconvincing and almost sappy. He's just not believable as a political candidate or as a romantic lead. Lopez, on the other hand was quite good, The two just don't mesh as a couple.The entire story strained credibility to the utmost, but I guess that's the case with most  Hollywood productions. If you want to believe this kind of romantic fairy tale, then go ahead, relax and enjoy the movie, by all means. Most of the acting was fairly good. The movie had a good flow to it and periods of boredom were not a problem. The photography and New York City scenes were quite good (I always wonder how they ever managed). The movie was somewhat touching and uplifting in places. It was also funny here and there, but not funny enough that I'd consider it to be a comedy. All in all, I'd have to say that it was not a bad movie, but it was not top rate either.

However, it is also a very profitable one, since the general audiences tend to go for the feel good movies around the holidays.  So what does Maid In Manhattan has to offer?  Or is it just another formulaic addition you can pass up?Marisa Ventura is a maid working for a high profile hotel in New York.  One day, while doing a routine round of cleaning the rooms, her co-worker talks her into trying on a guest's outfit.  Just then, her son Ty enters with Chris Marshall, a senatorial candidate who is in town to promote his campaign.  Catching Marisa off guard, she pretends to be a hotel guest and agrees to go on a short stroll in Central Park with them.  The two soon hit it off, and even though Marisa understands that she is way out of her league, Chris is persistent in wanting to get to know her better.  The only problem is how long can she keep the charade going?The rags to riches story is nothing new (&agrave; la Pretty Women), the same goes for the case of mistaken identity (While You Were Sleeping).  These are but two of the numerous clich&eacute;s employed in Maid In Manhattan.  Furthermore, even though the political aspect of the plot allowed some interesting interactions between the characters, it was ultimately under utilized and often seemed more of a distraction than an asset to the film.  I also had a hard time coming to terms with the relationship between Marisa and her mom, who for some unknown reason went out of her way to criticize and discourage her daughter in everything she does.  Then there's the absent father, which I thought was going to play an important part with all the big fuss that was made in the beginning of the movie, but he just sort of disappeared and never to be heard from again.  Good writing pays attention to little details like these, but instead they are just glossed over.Fortunately, Maid In Manhattan is supported by a solid cast.  Ralph Fiennes is surprisingly charming as the charismatic Chris Marshall.  An accomplished actor in classic dramas such as Schindler's List and The English Patient, I wasn't sure what to expect from someone who has never had a lead role in a romantic comedy.  Jennifer Lopez was equally likeable in the role of Marisa.  I admit of having my doubts about her, especially after the disastrous showing in Enough, which I consider as one of the worst movies this year.  Luckily she did a fine job in a part that seemed to be tailored just for her, and the on screen chemistry was definitely there between the two leads.  Stanley Tucci is hilarious playing Chris' aide Jeremy, but Tyler Posey was not very effective as Marisa's son Ty.Predictable and derivative, Maid In Manhattan is nevertheless a sweet and an entertaining movie.  It's not a bad way to spend a night at the theater, but in an already crowded season filled with quality films, I would not recommend it unless you've already seen everything else.",3,Sweet and charming but predictable,1039564800,"12 11, 2002",2002,3051,"['Romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'rarely', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'genre', 'too', 'often', 'plagued', 'clones', 'other', 'However', 'also', 'very', 'profitable', 'one', 'general', 'audiences', 'tend', 'go', 'feel', 'good', 'movies', 'holidays', 'So', 'what', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'offer', 'just', 'formulaic', 'addition', 'can', 'pass', 'up', 'Marisa', 'Ventura', 'maid', 'working', 'high', 'profile', 'hotel', 'New', 'York', 'One', 'day', 'doing', 'routine', 'round', 'cleaning', 'rooms', 'co-worker', 'talks', 'trying', 'guest', 'outfit', 'Just', 'then', 'son', 'Ty', 'enters', 'Chris', 'Marshall', 'senatorial', 'candidate', 'who', 'town', 'promote', 'campaign', 'Catching', 'Marisa', 'off', 'guard', 'be', 'hotel', 'guest', 'go', 'short', 'stroll', 'Central', 'Park', 'two', 'soon', 'hit', 'off', 'even', 'Marisa', 'way', 'league', 'Chris', 'persistent', 'wanting', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'only', 'problem', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'keep', 'charade', 'going', 'rags', 'riches', 'story', 'nothing', 'new', 'agrave', 'Pretty', 'Women', 'same', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'are', 'two', 'numerous', 'clich', 'eacute', 'employed', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'Furthermore', 'even', 'political', 'aspect', 'plot', 'allowed', 'interesting', 'interactions', 'characters', 'was', 'ultimately', 'utilized', 'often', 'seemed', 'more', 'distraction', 'asset', 'film', 'also', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'coming', 'terms', 'relationship', 'Marisa', 'mom', 'who', 'unknown', 'reason', 'went', 'way', 'criticize', 'discourage', 'daughter', 'everything', 'Then', 'absent', 'father', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'important', 'part', 'big', 'fuss', 'was', 'made', 'beginning', 'movie', 'just', 'sort', 'disappeared', 'never', 'be', 'heard', 'again', 'Good', 'writing', 'pays', 'attention', 'little', 'details', 'instead', 'are', 'just', 'glossed', 'over.Fortunately', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'supported', 'solid', 'cast', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'surprisingly', 'charming', 'charismatic', 'Chris', 'Marshall', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'classic', 'dramas', 'such', 'Schindler', 'List', 'English', 'Patient', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'lead', 'role', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'was', 'equally', 'likeable', 'role', 'Marisa', 'admit', 'having', 'doubts', 'especially', 'disastrous', 'showing', 'Enough', 'consider', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'year', 'Luckily', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'part', 'seemed', 'be', 'tailored', 'just', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'was', 'definitely', 'two', 'leads', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'hilarious', 'playing', 'Chris', 'aide', 'Jeremy', 'Tyler', 'Posey', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'effective', 'Marisa', 'son', 'Ty.Predictable', 'derivative', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'nevertheless', 'sweet', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'spend', 'night', 'theater', 'already', 'crowded', 'season', 'filled', 'quality', 'films', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'everything', 'else']",N/A

There was absolutely no chemistry here, and chemistry is a fundamental piece of the romantic comedy pie.  One of the other critical pieces, humor, was also in short supply.

Instead of Julia Roberts as a prostitute, we get Jennifer Lopez as a hotel maid.  However, besides the obvious similarities, the movie stands alone with the honest reflection of two people from different worlds, who quickly discover they need each other.  The politician who finds himself in awe of the intelligent woman, who reminds him that he doesn't really have a clue what those in receipt of his charity functions truly need, or what their lives are like.  And the maid with dreams of her own, but with a little more fear of success than failure.  This is a wonderful romantic film, and if I had to make a complaint I would have liked to see the politician step into the shoes of the poor for a day or two - as suggested to him.  This is the only place the film ran short, as Marisa did step into the lifestyle of his.  It would have made for a much more interesting, and maybe a little more humorous film.

I could stop this review right here and it would have sumarized the whole movie. But I want to go on and say some things.In my opinion, Jennifer Lopez is very beautiful, but she's still looking for the part that will make her an actress respected for her talent. Since ""The cell"", all her movies were completely awful. ""Maid in Manhattan"" is just a little rise in a sequence of bad movies. Ralph Fiennes is a very talented actor (one of my favorites) with a sequence of interesting (yes, good) movies and characters since the terrible ""The avengers"". He must be needing the money. Both Jennifer and Fiennes have played very different parts along their career. Jennifer Lopez hadn't done, so far, a complete-and-only latina girl (Selena, for example, was a more complex character - a real life person in fact -  not just a latina singer). I mean, think about ""The cell"", think about ""Blood and wine"". And Fiennes was that monster nazi Goeth in ""Schindler's list"", he was Francis Dollarhyde in ""Red dragon"", and best of all, he was the Count Almasy in ""English patient""! So, that's the question, why did they choose to play two over-stereotyped characters in a below average movie with a terrible script full of cliches (yes, there is the scene when the pretty lady has to prove lots of dresses and everyone is happy)?Maid in Manhattan is not even a three-stars movie, it's more like two-stars. But I will give it three. Why? Because in the end, after all the cliches and stereotypes, leaving reason aside, I could enjoy the parts of the movie that weren't completely annoying. I also liked the kid playing JLo's son.But the main reason is that there's a line that's going to be memorable:Marisa (J Lopez): I came here tonight to tell you this can't continue from this.Chris (Fiennes): Then you should have worn another dress.Grade 6.0/10",3,Stereotyped version of Cinderella - but everybody knew it,1050969600,"04 22, 2003",2003,1962,"['Maid', 'Manhattan', 'Cinderella', 'revisited', 'attempt', 're-create', 'atmosphere', 'Pretty', 'woman', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'could', 'stop', 'review', 'right', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'sumarized', 'whole', 'movie', 'want', 'go', 'say', 'things.In', 'opinion', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'very', 'beautiful', 'still', 'looking', 'part', 'will', 'make', 'actress', 'respected', 'talent', 'cell', 'movies', 'were', 'completely', 'awful', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'just', 'little', 'rise', 'sequence', 'bad', 'movies', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'one', 'favorites', 'sequence', 'interesting', 'yes', 'good', 'movies', 'characters', 'terrible', 'avengers', 'must', 'be', 'needing', 'money', 'Jennifer', 'Fiennes', 'have', 'played', 'very', 'different', 'parts', 'career', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'so', 'far', 'complete-and-only', 'latina', 'girl', 'Selena', 'example', 'was', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'real', 'life', 'person', 'fact', 'not', 'just', 'latina', 'singer', 'mean', 'think', 'cell', 'think', 'Blood', 'wine', 'Fiennes', 'was', 'monster', 'nazi', 'Goeth', 'Schindler', 'list', 'was', 'Francis', 'Dollarhyde', 'Red', 'dragon', 'best', 'was', 'Count', 'Almasy', 'English', 'patient', 'So', 'question', 'why', 'did', 'choose', 'play', 'two', 'over-stereotyped', 'characters', 'below', 'average', 'movie', 'terrible', 'script', 'full', 'cliches', 'yes', 'scene', 'when', 'pretty', 'lady', 'prove', 'lots', 'dresses', 'everyone', 'happy', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'not', 'even', 'three-stars', 'movie', 'more', 'two-stars', 'will', 'give', 'three', 'Why', 'end', 'cliches', 'stereotypes', 'leaving', 'reason', 'aside', 'could', 'enjoy', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'completely', 'annoying', 'also', 'liked', 'kid', 'playing', 'JLo', 'son.But', 'main', 'reason', 'line', 'going', 'be', 'memorable', 'Marisa', 'J', 'Lopez', 'came', 'here', 'tonight', 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'continue', 'this.Chris', 'Fiennes', 'Then', 'should', 'have', 'worn', 'dress.Grade', '6.0/10']",N/A

Maid in Manhattan stars Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fiennes as the main characters in what is effectively a reworking of several other ""rom-coms"". It borrows elements from Working Girl and Pretty Woman whilst being fundamentally derived from the eternal Cinderella story.Marisa Ventura (Lopez) is a maid in a very upmarket Manhattan hotel. Whilst she is highly dedicated and prides herself on delivering excellent service, she is certainly not servile. Egged on by her closest friend Stephanie, Marisa dons the Dolce & Gabbana outfit of Caroline Lane - a spoiled Sotheby's Director staying at the hotel (played by Natasha Richardson). As might be expected, the fates collude to having another guest at the hotel call on Caroline's room just as Marisa is testing out the haute couture.This guest is none other than Assemblyman Chris Marshall (Fiennes), who is immediately smitten by the high-class vision before him. Chris convinces Marisa to accompany him on a dog-walking mission through Central Park and so begins a romantic comedy of errors. Marissa is mistaken as the aspiring Senator's new love interest, and the paparazzi soon have her picture on the front page. Whilst Chris is falling in love with Marisa, she cannot bear to reveal that she is neither wealthy nor sophisticated, but merely a maid in service at his hotel.I will not spoil the ending of the movie for those who have not yet seen it, but as you may suspect there are very few surprises to be found. The ending of the movie is in little doubt after the first reel, and this inevitability is the weakest aspect of this production. Chris falls in love with Marisa after the briefest of meetings, and whilst she is rather pretty, his immediate infatuation is somewhat excessive. Lopez puts in a good solid performance but Fiennes simply 'phones his in - frequently looking slightly embarrassed to be there. There is nothing really new to see in this film. There is nothing here to challenge or offend your sensibilities. It is a cookie-cutter romantic comedy, albeit well filmed, well acted and entertaining enough. It is not, however, in the same league as Pretty Woman, and Fiennes and Lopez do not generate anywhere near as much as chemistry as Julia Roberts and Richard Gere managed in the earlier movie.Interestingly, the screenplay is credited to one Edmond Dantes - in reality this is a pseudonym for one John Hughes. Hughes has turned out some variable product in his time from the excellent Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Planes, Trains and Automobiles to the very mediocre Dennis the Menace. Presumably he was less than happy with having himself associated with Maid in Manhattan, although I do not see why. Whilst this film is a little derivative, it does provide some inoffensive family entertainment. It's not going to win him any Oscars, but I certainly wouldn't consider it an embarrassment.

He warms to her with a chemistry that I can buy, but of course the presence of her unbelievably cute and personable son doesn't hurt.  He's a little ambassador of guileless charm, and I hope to see him again in other films.It is essentially Lopez's turn as a modern day Latina sort-of-Cinderella that makes this movie tick.  Sure, the premise is pretty unbelievable, but why has Cinderella as a fable been handed down for so many years?  People love the beautiful dream, the happy ending.  Maid in Manhattan updates it and sets it in the big city.  The band of ""merry mice"" are her co-workers, including the excellent Bob Hoskins.  The ""wicked women"" (not her stepsisters, but the ones who would steal the show) are ultimately exposed as superficial and mean-spirited, and in the end sincerity and real beauty -- the kind that shines from within -- carries the day.Not bad ... for my money, Jennifer Lopez's best performance to date.

736607,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0000897EE,Lawyeraau,"[4, 6]","This is a relatively pleasant, though eminently forgettable, once-upon- a-time romantic comedy. Not even its excellent supporting cast can make this tepid movie better than it should be. Ralph Fiennes, with his sometimes British, sometimes American accent, and Jennifer Lopez, with her beauty marred the minute she opens her mouth, are the would be mis-matched lovers.Fiennes plays Chris Marshall, a wealthy, to the manor born, silver spoon, political candidate. Lopez plays Marissa Ventura, a working class woman and single parent with an adorable, precocious, ten year old son named Ty (Tyler Garcia Posey). Marissa works as a maid in the posh hotel in which Marshall is a guest. When her son accompanies her to work one day, he runs into Chris Marshall and recognizes him. They start up a conversation and before you know it they are going to go off for a walk together, only Ty has to ask his mom. They go to the suite in which she is cleaning, only thing is that she has tried one of the haute couture outfits belonging to a wealthy businesswoman named Caroline who is staying in the suite. Naturally, Marissa looks gorgeous in this outfit and is wearing it when Ty and Chris enter the suite. Chris is smitten, and all three go for a walk in the park. Chris does not know, and Marissa does not disclose, that she is one of the maids in the hotel. Don't ask. Don't tell.When Chris, thinking that his dream woman's name is Caroline, forwards an invitation for lunch to her ostensible suite, the real Caroline (Natasha Richardson) responds. Let the games begin! Marissa spends quite a bit if time avoiding running into Chris in her work clothes. When she finally runs into him in the street, Chris instructs his aide to find her and invite her to a glittering soiree. She gets the invitation via the hotel butler (Bob Hoskins), along with some advice, and decides to go for the gold. With her fellow employees at the hotel acting as collective fairy godmothers, she gets the proverbial ball gown, diamonds, makeover, and emerges a princess, making a dramatic entrance at the ball, further entrancing Chris. When she runs off before the ball is over, he pursues her, and what then follows is a night to remember.Of course, Natasha, who is also at the ball, sees Marissa and Chris together and realizes that she looks familiar. Consumed by the green eyed monster, she contacts the hotel authorities when the morning after the ball she sees Marissa, exiting the suite occupied by Chris and still wearing the diamond necklace she wore at the ball. A review of security tapes leads to her identification of Marissa and a host of other things. Chris is now faced with a choice, as is Marissa.The film is pretty formulaic in that it is filmed as a fairy tale. Of course it has the proverbial happy ending. The film is saved by the very funny performance of Natasha Richardson and her pre-menopausal, obnoxious friend played with relish and delicious abandon by Amy Sedaris. Stanley Tucci is excellent as Jerry, Chris Marshall's campaign manager. Bob Hoskins is very good as the prim and proper hotel butler, though the film strikes a false note towards the end when he gives Marissa a final speech that is ridiculous. Tyler Garcia Posey is a totally adorable child actor who gives a very natural and engaging performance.Ralph Fiennes gives a decent performance but has difficulty maintaining an American accent. Jennifer Lopez gives a better performance than she usually does but that is not saying a lot. It is unfortunate that to date she has been unable to replicate the level of performance that she gave in ""Selena"", the film that propelled her into stardom. She is, however, totally drop dead gorgeous when she is all gussied up, looking every inch the princess.Still, if one's expectations are not too high, one should find this to be a mildly entertaining, romantic comedy.

736615,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0000897EE,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 5]","I may be a bit generous in rating this movie two stars.  I do not think it is as bad as some people have said, but neither is it very good.First and foremost, the plot breaks no new ground.  We've had movies about maids that were quaint and funny and ended up giving us a lesson about life (""Maid to Order"" with Ally Sheedy).  We've had movies about women that were disadvantaged in life and managed to keep their dignity while trying to better themselves (""Pretty Woman"" is a great movie of this type, and ""Erin Brockovich"" had similar elements of someone overcoming their background to get ahead).This movie tries to breathe life into this genre by trying to contrast the maid with management potential and a multi-millionaire.  Unfortunately, we never see the development of the relationship as we do in ""Pretty Woman"".  Instead, the multi-millionaire sees the hot Hispanic babe in a suite, and automatically starts lusting for her.  Big deal.  Where is the chemistry?  Where is the achievement of understanding in how each sees the world, and the problems each face?  The relationship development between these two is less than shallow, it's completely dry.Second, the acting in this movie is not all that stellar.  I've seen Jennifer Lopez act.  She can be a very good actress.  However, this movie does not allow her to be sympathetic.  Her performance is as wooden as the script.  As for Fiennes, Richard Gere in ""Pretty Woman"" was absolutely emoting as compared to Mr. Fiennes.  An extreme underutilization of two people with talent.Lastly, this movie is one big cliche.  There is the maid cliche.  The poor girl-rich guy cliche.  The downtrodden Hispanic cliche.  The best friend (Jennifer's) cliche.  The ditzy, dumb, rich women cliche.  I could list cliches for a long time.  This movie could have been different if Fiennes was a maid and Jennifer Lopez was rich.  The dumb, ditzy, rich women could have been gay men after Fiennes.  This movie had potential.  Unfortunately it became just one more Cinderella story wannabe.

He is funny and energetic.Directed by Wayne Wang (The Joy Luck Club, Smoke) the film takes an honest look at race, class, income status and the reality of people and their stereotypes of others. It has great funny bits and a real emotional ending too.This is a great positive film for the whole family. Everyone should enjoy this sweet chocolate center at the middle.

We are happy enough when ones like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" put a new spin on the genre, but, basically, we go to such movies because they are comforting. Still, an entry can be so predictable that we can leave for ten minutes and come back to find that we have missed nothing. Such is the case with ""Maid in Manhattan"". Though sweet and cuddly-cute, it ends up making us feel slightly jilted.Marisa [Jennifer Lopez] is a young New Yorker struggling to support herself and her precocious son, Ty [Tyler Garcia Posey]. She works as a maid in an upscale Manhattan hotel. One day, while cleaning a suite, a co-worker talks her into trying on a guest's $5,000 suit. Christopher [Ralph Fiennes], a wealthy politician, sees her in the outfit and mistakes her for a rich woman. Instantly attracted to the guy, Marisa reluctantly keeps up the ruse. You can easily guess the rest of the story.This movie could just as easily have been made in 1940; in fact, something similar no doubt was. There's nothing wrong with this, except that ""Maid in Manhattan"" lacks the style and wit found in many older romantic comedies. It's all a very by-the-numbers production with lots of stereotypes and surprisingly few laughs.

So I was understandably wary about getting this, but it seemed like my kind of film, even being described as Prettier Woman. And after being told that my reputation was tarnished by buying this movie, I thought what the hell, put it in the DVD player, sat back, and got ready to get my claws out.Despite the severe lack of extras (has trailers for Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, Anger Management, and Daddy Day Care, plus a trailer for the film itself) I found myself really, really enjoying this film! It's a great feel good movie, and although it's nothing new, stealing ideas from Pretty Woman, Notting Hill (the press conference scene near the end) and that age old classic, Cinderella, I was sitting through it with a smile on my face.I have no problems with Jennifer Lopez as an actress. She's terrific, she played the part well, looking the part of the low down maid, with long, gorgeous hair. She doesn't quite match up to Julia Roberts (she doesn't have the big mouth for starters), but I can't see Julia Roberts, earning mega bucks per movie, ever going back to the pay she earned for Pretty Woman.Who I did have a problem with however, was Ralph Fiennes. Not exactly the most charismatic leading man ever! He shows no emotion throughout the film, and just annoys the hell out of me generally. They could have had any fantastic leading man, but they blew the budget on J-Lo. (Now his younger brother, hello, hello, hello!) With Richard Gere in Pretty Woman, his hair was grey, and he was a lot older, but he always had that twinkle in his eye. And you know what they say about guys with twinkles in their eyes - they beat the guys without twinkles in their eyes hands down.I had a minor argument about comparing it to Cinderella. Thankfully, there were no ugly sisters, but it was a modern day Cinderella, without a doubt. Everyone knows the story about Cinderella, so I won't go into it here and now. She did go to the ball, and she did run away from her Prince Charming, and the Prince Charming ran after her, and found her glass slipper. (Although technically, that didn't happen in this - the director probably thought he would be too obvious with that.)The soundtrack isn't that terrific. J-Lo being J-Lo, just has to get TWO of her songs onto the soundtrack, one being a cover of a Diana Ross classic (no, not Chain Reaction). The rest was filled up with Norah Jones - dull as ditchwater, I'm sorry.Every girl will enjoy this film. They will be jealous of Jennifer Lopez, and will put themselves in her place, and hopefully replace Ralph Fiennes with their own Prince Charming. It's definitely not a guy film, and gals, if your boyfriend wants to see it, it's only because he fancies J-Lo. And if any girls don't like it, get them to report to me. I'll sit them in front of Lost Highway.

When the upper-crusty Marshall mistakes Marisa, the hired help, for a guest of the hotel,  he finds himself immediately attracted to her. Although Marisa shares those feelings, she feels she must prevent him from discovering her true identity. While Marisa is trying to evade him, Marshall is trying to track her down so that they may meet again. Aided by her coworkers, Marisa is able to have one night on the town with Marshall, complete with borrowed diamond jewelry and a regal ball gown, before she must abandon the charmed life for good. But that isn't the end of the story. This is a fairy tale, after all.Maid in Manhattan is the kind of movie that Jennifer Lopez makes specifically for her many young fans. It is a modern-day fairy tale. The story is contrived and improbable, but charming. She includes a message of empowerment and encouragement for those young fans: Don't let other people's expectations define you. The song ""I'm Coming Out"" by Diana Ross ridiculously materializes out of thin air for the characters to dance to on several occasions. Everyone lives happily ever after -except the bad guys. But this is a fairy tale, so I really can't fault the film those things.What impressed me the most about Maid in Manhattan is the casting. Jennifer Lopez is surrounded by heavy-duty thespians in what are essentially fluff roles: The incomparable Ralph Fiennes is handsome and charming in a role considerably less demanding than his usual fare. Stanley Tucci is quite convincingly abrasive as Chris Marshall's campaign manager. Natasha Richardson is the insufferably neurotic hotel guest for whom Marisa is mistaken. Bob Hoskins is a hotel butler sympathetic to Marisa's predicament. These accomplished actors take this opportunity that they don't have in more serious films to have fun with their characters. Particularly admirable are Stanley Tucci and Natasha Richardson, who play their characters over-the-top to great effect. Fans of Ralph Fiennes may be disappointed to see him in a role of so little depth. But he is the best looking and best mannered Senatorial candidate I have ever seen, so I can't say that I mind. Tyler Posey is also charming as Marisa's young son Ty.Maid in Manhattan is not a great movie. But it is fun, light and sweet. Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fiennes are attractive and appealing in their leading roles. The supporting cast is terrific. I am sure that all those young girls who admire J. Lo's music so much will thoroughly enjoy this movie. And they are its intended audience.

Overall, it's perfectly harmless if not exactly original.  In all, it's a nice flick to check-out on a Friday night if nothing else good is on.THE STORY:Marissa Ventura (J'Lo) is a single-mother who works as a maid in one of Manhattan's top hotels.  A hard working, intelligent woman she is up for promotion and is a sure lock in to ""represent"" all the working class women of the travel industry when she makes a pretty big faux pas at the behest of a co-worker, she tries on the posh outfit of a socialite guest and is happened upon by a Senatorial candidate staying at the hotel, Chris Marshall (Ralph Fiennes). From there the by-the-numbers storybook romance takes place.THE ANALYSIS:Overall, this is a perfectly harmless and sweet love story cookie cut from the same mold like all others in the genre.  There are a handful of touching scenes with the couple and Marissa's son Tyler (Tyler Posey) provides a lot of the best scenes in the film.  The interaction between the main characters and between Marissa and her co-workers, particularly the butler and security guard, are superb.

Predictably, the answer is yes.  But the story goes nowhere and fast.  Jennifer Lopez is the poor, but proud, maid who impersonates a society dame to win the heart of the ultra-bland senator, played by Ralph Fiennes.  The plot is trite, relying heavily on stereotypes and cliches, with simplistically drawn characters, wasted opportunities and zero romantic chemistry between the two principle leads.  Stellar talents, Bob Hoskins and Stanley Tucci, are wasted in a nothing supporting roles. The whole film smacks of starvation for some witty dialogue.  Instead we get excessive music video-eque montages and the all too preachy sermons from Lopez, who has to keep reminding Fiennes and us that being Latino and poor are not handicaps.Columbia Tristar's 2:35:1 anamorphic transfer, like the film's subject matter, is fairly average.  Colors are well balanced. Fine detail can be nicely rendered but, on occasion, gets lost in a soft haze.  Edge enhancement and shimmering are present but not obtrusive.  Contrast and black levels are fairly accurate.  Pixelization can break up background information from time to time.  The audio is 5.1 and reasonably well represented.  The music track seems excessively overpowering, jumping off the center and side channel speakers.BOTTOM LINE: This film is strictly for those who love J-Lo.

I've been somewhat surprised lately to learn that many people have disliked this film because it is formulaic and predictable.  In other words, it is a formulaic film, but this is not, to me, a problem, since virtually all romantic comedies do, to some degree, follow a formula.  So, yeah, guy meets gal, guy loses gal, guy gets gal back, but I like to think of romantic comedies as a thought problems.  The one wanting to solve the problem (the screenwriter) has to get the two leads from point A (meeting) to point B (losing one another) to point C (getting together again) is free to navigate our hero and heroine in any way he or she chooses, and how good the film is depends upon how likable the characters are and how cleverly they move from Point A to Point C.So on this standard, how does MAID IN MANHATTAN stack up?  First, Jennifer Lopez is utterly adorable.  I know she gets a lot of criticism in the media for being a diva, and perhaps she is, but onscreen, she almost always manages to be a thoroughly lovable individual.  In this film, I like the way she manages to employ a Latino rhythm to her speech without actually having an accent.  It is the sign of a good actress with a good ear.  In her other romantic comedy, THE WEDDING PLANNER, she didn't have the slightest hint of a Spanish accent.  Here, however, it is there ever so lightly, almost more of a hint rather than an actuality.  Unfortunately, I didn't like Ralph Fiennes in his role of a senatorial candidate.  He isn't bad; he just doesn't stand out here like he usually does in his roles.  Nor do the two of them have nearly the degree of chemistry that I normally like to see, say like Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal in WHEN HARRY MET SALLY or Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in NOTTING HILL.  But Jennifer Lopez is so adorable, and the situation that is developed is so enjoyable, that the romance is one that we pull for and hope for.  We may not especially care that the two of them get together for the politician's sake, but we do very much pull for the maid.  After all, in CINDERELLA, who really focuses on the prince rather than the heroine?The film does a pretty good job of going from Point A to Point C.

We've all seen this movie a hundred times a hundred different ways, so I'm not going to insult anyone by going over the plot.The acting is just average.  That's OK though; sometimes (even though the plot may be overdone) there is value in simply not messing anything up and having said that said, both Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fiennes don't screw up.  Don't misunderstand; I say that somewhat tongue-in-cheek, creatively speaking, they're not exactly stretching themselves either.  I thought that Lopez was terrific in 'The Cell' and super-cool in 'Out of Sight.'  Fiennes also has a bunch of movies I thought he was great in, most notably `The English Patient.'  `Maid in Manhattan' certainly doesn't rank anywhere near those movies.  However, all of that's really neither here nor there though I guess.  They both turn in a solid outing; I suppose that's the bottom line.My problem (and admittedly, maybe this is just me being 'a guy') is that I just CAN'T TAKE the clich&eacute; of &quot;The Cinderella Story&quot; anymore.

It was the latter. While I don't exactly care for Jennifer in her singing ability (or her fake singing ability), she is still excellent and charming as Marisa, or should we call her Maria? She is just so lovable you are rooting for her to have happiness the whole time. You are really able to put yourself in her shoes. Ralph Fiennes is excellent as well as a womanizing politician (forget his name-wasn't too interested in it) who falls head over heels for Marisa. The boy who plays her son is also excellent, and he plays the role believably, he won't strike you as the son of some rich person involved with the film who was able to get him shoved in, the kid is talented. Also excellent are Natasha Richardson as the annoying but hilarious Caroline and her companion played by the fantastic Amy Sidaris who is even more annoying and even more hilarious. She really hates Marisa just because of her nationality: ""Why are you asking her, she can't even speak English!"". The maids who work in the hotel and are friends of Marisa are excellent as well.

It's as if each sentence is aimed at being the most predegisted, consumerist, banal item that could be. Intentionally! It's like they wrote, and re-wrote, and shot and reshot up until they managed to make sure no iota of anything resembling creative thought made it into the final product.

736647,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B0000897EE,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[6, 9]","On the surface Maid In Manhattan it seems like a light romantic comedy with a predictable and sweet love story. However the numerous racist and sexist stereotypes throughout the undertones of this Cinderella tale will make any viewer of color extremely bitter. Better have a couple of barf bags around while watching this movie. You're gonna need them.Jennifer Lopez is a maid in a four-star downtown Manhattan hotel. (Stereotype #1 about Latinas) She dreams of becoming a hotel manager (Stereotype #2 about Latinas- all work in service jobs). A single mother (Stereotype #3) she struggles to work during the day and take care of her 10-year-old son and is supported by her mother (Stereotype#4) who works in a rundown Spanish restaurant uptown (Stereotype#5) While cleaning the room of a rich British woman, she decides to try on some of her clothes. Conveniently, a rich senate candidate comes to the room and mistakes her for the Hotel guest. He's smitten by her charm and her looks. She's attracted to his loot. So to bag the rich guy she and her friends (also minority stereotypes) go along with the ruse and more supposedly humorous hijinks ensue. The flimsy story disappears and the movie slowly changes from a vehichle for Jennifer Lopez, Actress into a vanity project for J. Lo, Superstar. We get numerous shots of her walking around the city in designer clothes, Eating at fancy restaurants and trying too hard to look hot while courting a bored Senate candidate. The movie comes to a climax when the ruse is revealed. She and her friends at the hotel are fired and her dreams of becoming a Hotel Manager are crushed.But wait-Prince Charming(tm) is riding down in his white limo to save her. He's had such a wonderful time with her that he's fallen in love(tm). He tries to talk to her in the street, but she gives him some spiel about not knowing who she was when she was a maid and now caring about her. This leads to him seeking her out at her new job. While she's working at another hotel, where he's conveniently he's holding a press conference, he finds her and professes undying love for her. They kiss and we get a montage of pictures showing them living happily ever set to J.Lo's painful butchering of Diana Ross' classic ""I'm Coming out."" She's married to the senator, getting the management job at the hotel and then one of her saying they're still married a year later. Excuse me I have to go puke. (I also have to reorder the barf bags; no telling when I'm going to need them for the next romantic comedy)Words can't describe how much I hate this movie. It's an insult to women and minorities. Maid in Manhattan insidiously hides numerous racist and sexist messages under a beautiful front of pretty actors, lavish locations and luxury goods. The movie secretly tells women of color they can't find success without those essentials for success: expensive designer clothes, perfect make-up, beautiful hair and a rich White man to save them. Worse, it tells women to lie and manipulate to get what they want. Because we all know working hard takes way too much time from shopping. Movies like this aren't bad; they're bad for you. Watch too many movies like these and you'll get your mind warped.It seems like the producers were trying to make a ""Pretty Woman"" type movie for J.Lo but they didn't understand the execution of J.F. Lawton's brilliant concept. In an attempt to copy Pretty Woman, Maid in Manhattan tries to update the fairy tale by just using minority characters in most of the roles and fails miserably. There was a lot more under the surface of the Richard Gere/Julia Roberts vehichle than most people understand. Pretty Woman wasn't an update of a fairytale it was a satire poking fun at the fairy tale. Lawton was making fun of all the fairy tale stereotypes by using L.A's downtrodden as the characters in the story. He was making the comment that to get to happily ever after both the man and the woman have to learn to value each other as equals.The acting here is horrible. No, scratch that it's WRETCHED. Jennifer Lopez is terrible. Terrible singing, terrible acting and she didn't look too hot in all those designer clothes either. She has no chemistry with Ralph Finnes and adds no dimension whatsoever to her character. Throughout the movie she's just J.Lo superstar playing dress up. After seeing this movie and Enough I can tell you Jennifer Lopez's acting career is in serious trouble. She's gone from an actress who showed tremendous potential Selena, Out of Sight, and Anaconda to an egotistical over-the-top ham with no presence and no personality. Ralph Finnes is horribly miscast in the role of the Senate candidate. I couldn't believe he was from New York with that British accent that kept popping up in every scene. An actor of his caliber deserves better than this syrupy slop. Bob Hoskins must need some rent money because a fine actor like him deserves better than this. Natasha Richardson and Amy Sedaris chew on scenery while waiting for their paychecks to clear. Tyler Posey (Parker Posey's son) is the only actor to give a good performance here. I'd love to see more of him in the future.Please, Please IF YOU VALUE YOUR DAUGHTER'S SELF-ESTEEM DO NOT LET THEM WATCH THIS MOVIE! Get them the Wonderful Bend it Like Beckham, Akeelah and The Bee, and Disney's Mulan. The older crowds can Get Muriel's Wedding, J.F. Lawton's Pretty Woman or his hilarious Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death.",1,NOT JUST BAD BAD FOR YOU!

736648,A3G8M1XWGVW9XX,B0000897EE,"shelley de lange ""avid reader""","[1, 1]","I give this film 4 stars for the star power, great chemistry of the two leads (so many romantic comedies really don't have leads with good chemistry), fine supporting players (especially Bob Hoskins and Stanley Tucci) and great direction from Wayne Wang.I had my doubts as to whether J-lo could convince me that she was a working-class woman from the Bronx who had ""lived all her life within 4 blocks"" since, as we know, she got out and is living large. Well, she did just great! And Ralph Fiennes was the perfect romantic lead, and although it's tough for me to believe in a well-meaning, non-corrupt politician anymore I believed in him LOL!J-lo is a single mom with a gifted child (Tyler Posey, a wonderful actor) who nevertheless has his challenges such as stagefright and freezing up when doing speeches. She works as a maid in a high-class Manhattan hotel where Ralph is staying for a press junket. In a rare moment of breaking the rules, she is seen by Ralph in a high-priced suite wearing designer clothes. They take a walk through the park and Ralph is smitten.The movie clearly depicts without getting heavy-handed the contrast between those with money and those who serve them. There's even a sign that says a good maid ""strives to be invisible"" in the claustrophic corridor where they hold meetings before cleaning the rooms. J-lo is shoved into applying for a management position by a friend just when her romance is heating up, which jeapordizes her future with the hotel. The class distinctions add a layer of meaning to this film that is missing from most romantic comedies, giving it a little more depth and relevance than most.Wayne Wang brings out the best in his actors, really lets them shine. The cinematography is fascinating - when they're out on the street, it's very gritty and realistic. when they're out on the town at a high-priced affair, it looks very clear and romantic.My one complaint is with the script and the fact that J-lo and Ralph really don't have all that much interaction by the end of the movie. The dialogue isn't always that snappy or great but the star power is there in such force that even asking for a cup of coffee seems like a brilliant line. That's why I only give this movie 4 stars.

736649,ABE14SVILZLNY,B0000897EE,"SID ""Punk""","[21, 29]","Marisa Ventura (Jennifer Lopez) is a struggling maid in one of New York City's top hotels. Juggling her work with the raising of her 10 year-old son (Tyler Posey), Marisa dreams of a better life, but is afraid of taking a risk to achieve it. Enter Chris Marshall (Ralph Fiennes), a senatorial candidate who has grown weary of the campaign trail. When an incident involving mistaken identity leads Chris to believe that Marisa is a guest of the hotel and not the help, he is instantly smitten with her. Soon enough, Marisa finds herself in over her head, unable to reveal her true vocation to her admirer, and, also in the process, trying not to jeopardize her co-workers' (including Bob Hoskins and Chris Eigeman) jobs with her tomfoolery.Trapped inside this decidedly traditional, ""Cinderella"" style romantic comedy is a charming little picture with an unusual filmmaking pedigree behind it. Director Wayne Wang, who made a more artistic choices in his earlier pictures with ""The Joy Luck Club,"" and ""Smoke,"" takes the reigns of this big time Hollywood film. Coming off his deliciously lurid stripper vs. internet geek fantasy ""The Center Of The World,"" ""Maid"" feels like a sort of palate cleanser for the filmmaker. `Maid' is a rather unchallenging film, and Wang is just the man to flex some romantic comedy muscles that may have atrophied a little bit in recent years, and brings some freshness to the worn-thin genre. ""Maid In Manhattan"" isn't anything to scream about, but it's an appealing picture, made with care, and just light enough to fit perfectly with the holidays. While Wang attempts to stay within expected parameters, his filmmaking skills transform deathly predictable material into something enjoyable, and even a smidge touching.The biggest working component in ""Maid"" is Jennifer Lopez, who for the first time in a long time, is able to squeeze out some actual onscreen appeal in a way her off-screen persona has been overshadowing in recent years. There is little to no ""J-Lo"" in Lopez's performance as Marisa, and she actually makes the leap into fusing a little reality into her blue-collar role. After all the years singing about how ""real"" she is, here's a role that actually showcases some honest-to-god sweetness underneath all the glam. It's revelatory, especially after what I thought would be her career-ender, last May's ""Enough.""Ralph Fiennes is unexpected here as well. The normally uncompromising, chilly actor takes the opportunity within ""Maid"" to warm up, and drop his usual pretences. Initially, the sight of Fiennes smiling and being so jovial is disconcerting. After all, this is the same man after all who tore up the screen in ""Red Dragon,"" playing the frequently naked, tattoo covered, human-lips-eating serial killer Francis Dollarhyde. Watching him kissing ladies, shaking hands, and being nice to children takes some time to get used to. Soon enough, it isn't so weird to see Fiennes court Lopez, and by the end of the film, I really appreciated the risk Fiennes took here by playing way outside his normal range of characters. I wouldn't say he has a future as a Cary Grant-type, but this is another interesting choice for the ferociously talented performer.Being light and bubbly is in ""Maid In Manhattan's"" best interests, for when it steps outside of this, and tries to engage a not-too-subtle class conflict subplot, the effect drowns the picture instantly. Rich vs. poor is just fine for other features, but ""Maid"" doesn't need it. There are already enough conflicts (both comedic and dramatic) between Marisa and Chris to keep the film occupied, without Wang and screenwriter Kevin Wade (""Junior"") trying to interject gold-digging suggestions into the plot. It doesn't make too much sense within the story, and it radically betrays the characters' initial motivations. There are already too many ""you go, girl!"" moments and barely tolerable cutesy clich&eacute;s to fend off, the film doesn't need to get this absurd.This was a surprise, I'll be perfectly honest. Until her raging celebrity wore off a bit, I had written off Jennifer Lopez's abilities and charisma, but here you go - honest proof that it still exists.",4,Maid in Manhattan,1039651200,"12 12, 2002",2002,4173,"['Marisa', 'Ventura', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'struggling', 'maid', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'top', 'hotels', 'Juggling', 'work', 'raising', '10', 'year-old', 'son', 'Tyler', 'Posey', 'Marisa', 'better', 'life', 'afraid', 'taking', 'risk', 'achieve', 'Enter', 'Chris', 'Marshall', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'senatorial', 'candidate', 'who', 'grown', 'weary', 'campaign', 'trail', 'When', 'incident', 'involving', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'Chris', 'believe', 'Marisa', 'guest', 'hotel', 'not', 'help', 'instantly', 'smitten', 'Soon', 'enough', 'Marisa', 'head', 'unable', 'reveal', 'true', 'vocation', 'admirer', 'also', 'process', 'trying', 'not', 'jeopardize', 'co-workers', 'including', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Chris', 'Eigeman', 'jobs', 'tomfoolery.Trapped', 'decidedly', 'traditional', 'Cinderella', 'style', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'charming', 'little', 'picture', 'unusual', 'filmmaking', 'pedigree', 'Director', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'who', 'made', 'more', 'artistic', 'choices', 'earlier', 'pictures', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'Smoke', 'reigns', 'big', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'Coming', 'off', 'deliciously', 'lurid', 'stripper', 'vs.', 'internet', 'geek', 'fantasy', 'Center', 'World', 'Maid', 'feels', 'sort', 'palate', 'cleanser', 'filmmaker', 'Maid', 'rather', 'unchallenging', 'film', 'Wang', 'just', 'man', 'flex', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'muscles', 'may', 'have', 'atrophied', 'little', 'bit', 'recent', 'years', 'freshness', 'worn-thin', 'genre', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', ""n't"", 'anything', 'scream', 'about', 'appealing', 'picture', 'made', 'care', 'just', 'light', 'enough', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'holidays', 'Wang', 'stay', 'expected', 'parameters', 'filmmaking', 'skills', 'transform', 'deathly', 'predictable', 'material', 'something', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'smidge', 'touching.The', 'biggest', 'working', 'component', 'Maid', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'who', 'first', 'time', 'long', 'time', 'able', 'squeeze', 'out', 'actual', 'onscreen', 'appeal', 'way', 'off-screen', 'persona', 'been', 'overshadowing', 'recent', 'years', 'little', 'J-Lo', 'Lopez', 'performance', 'Marisa', 'actually', 'leap', 'fusing', 'little', 'reality', 'blue-collar', 'role', 'years', 'singing', 'how', 'real', 'here', 'role', 'actually', 'honest-to-god', 'sweetness', 'glam', 'revelatory', 'especially', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'career-ender', 'last', 'May', 'Enough', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'unexpected', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'normally', 'uncompromising', 'chilly', 'actor', 'opportunity', 'Maid', 'warm', 'up', 'drop', 'usual', 'pretences', 'Initially', 'sight', 'Fiennes', 'smiling', 'being', 'so', 'jovial', 'disconcerting', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'tore', 'up', 'screen', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'playing', 'frequently', 'naked', 'tattoo', 'covered', 'human-lips-eating', 'serial', 'killer', 'Francis', 'Dollarhyde', 'Watching', 'kissing', 'ladies', 'shaking', 'hands', 'being', 'nice', 'children', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'Soon', 'enough', ""n't"", 'so', 'weird', 'see', 'Fiennes', 'court', 'Lopez', 'end', 'film', 'really', 'appreciated', 'risk', 'Fiennes', 'took', 'here', 'playing', 'way', 'normal', 'range', 'characters', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'future', 'Cary', 'Grant-type', 'interesting', 'choice', 'ferociously', 'talented', 'performer.Being', 'light', 'bubbly', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'best', 'interests', 'when', 'steps', 'outside', 'tries', 'engage', 'not-too-subtle', 'class', 'conflict', 'subplot', 'effect', 'picture', 'instantly', 'Rich', 'poor', 'just', 'fine', 'other', 'features', 'Maid', ""n't"", 'need', 'are', 'already', 'enough', 'conflicts', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'Marisa', 'Chris', 'keep', 'film', 'occupied', 'Wang', 'screenwriter', 'Kevin', 'Wade', 'Junior', 'trying', 'interject', 'gold-digging', 'suggestions', 'plot', ""n't"", 'make', 'too', 'much', 'sense', 'story', 'radically', 'characters', 'initial', 'motivations', 'are', 'already', 'too', 'many', 'go', 'girl', 'moments', 'barely', 'tolerable', 'cutesy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'fend', 'off', 'film', ""n't"", 'need', 'get', 'absurd.This', 'was', 'surprise', ""'ll"", 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'raging', 'celebrity', 'wore', 'off', 'bit', 'had', 'written', 'off', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'abilities', 'charisma', 'here', 'go', 'honest', 'proof', 'still']",N/A

I'm glad I watched it, and the movie is not bad at all.  I was actually quite surprised by how enjoyable this movie was.  Granted it's predictable, but it's a good sweet film.  It's one I would consider watching again. Ty really stole the movie.  He was too cute!!!Jennifer Lopez plays Marisa Ventura.  She is a single mother who works as a maid in a Manhattan hotel.  Marisa actually would like to apply for a management position, but she has doubts, and her mother is not helpful where encouragement is concerned.  Marisa is cleaning the room of a rich man hungry woman and tries on some of the outfits in her closet.  Christopher Hall who is running for the Senate runs into Maria's adorable son in the elevator at the hotel she works at, and he takes Ty to see her so he can ask permission to walk with Hall and his dog.  They meet, mistaken identity, and love at first site.  That's when the problems and the fun begin.  Marisa ends up getting to know him a little, and they begin to date.  Hall is totally enamored with Marisa.  He likes that she is not only beautiful, but intelligent, and she has her own opinions.  The rich woman whose room she was cleaning notices something is amiss because she can't get the Halls attention, and when she discovers a missing piece of jewelry on Marisa's neck reports her to management, and Marisa looses her job.Natasha Richardson is quite funny as a rich, but annoying Caroline, and her friend played by Amy Sidaris is even more annoying.  I liked how they discussed some of the serotypes that are in the Latino community.  For example: ""Why are you asking her, she can't even speak English!"".  Just because Marisa is Latino it was assumed she could not speak English, and that's wrong, but sadly it's common.  I was very happy when Marisa stood up to her mother and went after her career goals.  I mean why settle, when you can do something that will be better? The dress Marissa wore to the fund raiser event was simply gorgeous!!  Jennifer Lopez is simply a beautiful, beautiful woman.  This is a great film.  It's a sweet film.

736652,A2G606VQGJ5EN9,B0000897EE,Sodalug,"[2, 2]","Says another astute moviegoer at the conclusion of Maid in Manhattan ""Well, it was almost as good as The Wedding Planner."" Couldn't have said it better myself. For many viewers, the modernized Cinderella story never gets old, no matter how often or how badly it is retold. Some critics believe this is a well made formula picture. I strongly disagree and firmly believe there is no such thing as a well made formula picture, and such a statement is a contradiction. Thankfully I'm not alone among critics at least, as Maid scored a paltry 37% on the Tomatometer. Sadly it did lead the box-office this weekend with $19 million, J-lo's best ever, leaving her prior $17 million debut in The Cell in the dust. It also surpassed The Wedding Planner's opening of $13.5 million, so it would seem, my fellow moviegoer was not 100% correct.The plot is exceedingly simple: J-lo is a hard working, single-mom princess in a maid's outfit from the PJs of Brooklyn trying to get a break in the apparently racist and sexist world of high end Manhattan 4-star hotels. Fiennes is a dapper, apparently wealthy, politician who is staying in the hotel she works at. And through a series of idiot misunderstandings, Fiennes becomes infatuated with J-lo and her tell-it-like-it-be-giiiirlfriend attitude. Romanticism and comedy ensue (in theory).In practice the film was very poorly written and painfully predictable. The direction and cinematography were as unoriginal and uninspired as the rest of the film, which seems fitting. Production wise, it had that spotless, soap commercial quality where even the grimy streets of Brooklyn look freshly painted. Acting was just plain bad overall.J-lo was at least believable in her role, stereotypical as it is (at least she doesn't overact her parts). Fiennes and his politician with a heart of gold who just wants to do the right thing if only he knew what that was is so ridiculous it was about the only thing I found funny in the whole film. A politician with a conscience? -can't happen. Bob Hoskins, an otherwise fine actor, finds himself in the role of a senior butler in the hotel who attempts to take J-lo under his wizened wing and teach her the ropes. He fills the role well, but makes an inexplicably long and arduous speech near the end of the film, something about the honor of service while never forgetting ""they"" are not better than you or something. It might have worked in a better film, but here is just seemed out of place. Finally, young Tyler plays the precocious Son of J-Lo and does a fine job for a child actor. His best scene comes in the elevator with Fiennes where he surprises the unexpecting adults with his uncommon knowledge of politics. Otherwise he does his part looking cute and wide eyed the rest of the movie without sickening the audience.The worst part about Maid is its most obvious of contradictions. In Maid, and so many movies like it, ""good"" characters are equated with being poor to middle class, hardworking salt of the earth types. And conversely, ""bad"" characters are rich, lazy, scheming, and generally rude to good and bad people alike. But we the audience are asked to accept that such a good character such as J-Lo would even be capable of falling in love with a member of this opposite class. Perhaps with some time and some initial struggling, but in Maid and other films it happens almost automatically. The audience generally roots for this to happen, yet the logic of the characterization dictates that once the good/poor character gains the wealth of their love interest that they are likely to be corrupted themselves. People with money are almost universally portrayed negatively in such films, yet we are asked at the same time to believe that our protagonist should seek out such a life.",2,Just another chick flick,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,3773,"['astute', 'moviegoer', 'conclusion', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'Well', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'Could', ""n't"", 'have', 'said', 'better', 'many', 'viewers', 'modernized', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'never', 'old', 'matter', 'how', 'often', 'how', 'badly', 'retold', 'critics', 'believe', 'well', 'made', 'formula', 'picture', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'firmly', 'believe', 'such', 'thing', 'well', 'made', 'formula', 'picture', 'statement', 'contradiction', 'Thankfully', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone', 'critics', 'least', 'Maid', 'scored', 'paltry', '37', '%', 'Tomatometer', 'Sadly', 'did', 'lead', 'box-office', 'weekend', '19', 'million', 'J-lo', 'best', 'ever', 'leaving', 'prior', '17', 'million', 'debut', 'Cell', 'dust', 'also', 'surpassed', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'opening', '13.5', 'million', 'would', 'seem', 'fellow', 'moviegoer', 'was', 'not', '100', '%', 'correct.The', 'plot', 'exceedingly', 'simple', 'J-lo', 'hard', 'working', 'single-mom', 'princess', 'maid', 'outfit', 'PJs', 'Brooklyn', 'trying', 'get', 'break', 'apparently', 'racist', 'sexist', 'world', 'high', 'end', 'Manhattan', '4-star', 'hotels', 'Fiennes', 'dapper', 'apparently', 'wealthy', 'politician', 'who', 'staying', 'hotel', 'series', 'idiot', 'misunderstandings', 'Fiennes', 'infatuated', 'J-lo', 'tell-it-like-it-be-giiiirlfriend', 'attitude', 'Romanticism', 'comedy', 'ensue', 'theory', '.In', 'practice', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'poorly', 'written', 'painfully', 'predictable', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'were', 'unoriginal', 'uninspired', 'rest', 'film', 'fitting', 'Production', 'wise', 'had', 'spotless', 'soap', 'commercial', 'quality', 'where', 'even', 'grimy', 'streets', 'Brooklyn', 'look', 'freshly', 'painted', 'Acting', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'overall.J-lo', 'was', 'least', 'believable', 'role', 'stereotypical', 'least', ""n't"", 'overact', 'parts', 'Fiennes', 'politician', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'just', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'only', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'found', 'funny', 'whole', 'film', 'politician', 'conscience', '-ca', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'actor', 'role', 'senior', 'butler', 'hotel', 'who', 'take', 'J-lo', 'wizened', 'wing', 'teach', 'ropes', 'role', 'well', 'inexplicably', 'long', 'arduous', 'speech', 'end', 'film', 'something', 'honor', 'service', 'never', 'forgetting', 'are', 'not', 'better', 'something', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'film', 'here', 'just', 'seemed', 'place', 'Finally', 'young', 'Tyler', 'precocious', 'Son', 'J-Lo', 'fine', 'job', 'child', 'actor', 'best', 'scene', 'elevator', 'Fiennes', 'where', 'unexpecting', 'adults', 'uncommon', 'knowledge', 'politics', 'Otherwise', 'part', 'looking', 'cute', 'wide', 'eyed', 'rest', 'movie', 'sickening', 'audience.The', 'worst', 'part', 'Maid', 'most', 'obvious', 'contradictions', 'Maid', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'good', 'characters', 'are', 'equated', 'being', 'poor', 'middle', 'class', 'hardworking', 'salt', 'earth', 'types', 'conversely', 'bad', 'characters', 'are', 'rich', 'lazy', 'scheming', 'generally', 'rude', 'good', 'bad', 'people', 'alike', 'audience', 'are', 'asked', 'accept', 'such', 'good', 'character', 'such', 'J-Lo', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'capable', 'falling', 'love', 'member', 'opposite', 'class', 'Perhaps', 'time', 'initial', 'struggling', 'Maid', 'other', 'films', 'almost', 'automatically', 'audience', 'generally', 'happen', 'yet', 'logic', 'characterization', 'once', 'good/poor', 'character', 'gains', 'wealth', 'love', 'interest', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'corrupted', 'People', 'money', 'are', 'almost', 'universally', 'portrayed', 'negatively', 'such', 'films', 'yet', 'are', 'asked', 'same', 'time', 'believe', 'protagonist', 'should', 'seek', 'out', 'life']",N/A

Maybe it was a mid-life crisis. But in my opinion, I think it had to have been blackmail of the darkest kind for Ralph Fiennes to agree to do such a film. Judging from the pained expression on his face during the entire film, one can easily see he is not there of his own free will.JLo, on the other hand, happily struts through the film, basking in the adoration of all the characters surrounding her. This is not suprising. If JLo wants to prove to us she can act, she's going to have to step out of her little ""comfort-zone"" characters. You know the ones I'm talking about - rags to riches, tuff girl with a heart of gold, highschool grad woman who is truly Yale-worthy brilliant, always smarter than her leading man... etcetcetc. She is so self-aware when she acts I'm constantly waiting for her to turn to the camera and say, ""Did you think that take was cute?"" or ""Can I get some more compliments in this dialogue please?"" She's a beautiful woman and occasionally a good singer and actress... I don't hate her, I just don't see anything about her other than her looks that makes me go ""wow"".Ralph Fiennes, on the other hand... he's an amazing AMAZING actor, as he proved so astoundingly in Schindlers List. I'll limit myself on this topic simply to ""Why?Why?Why, Ralph, why?""It wasn't merely that the premise of the story has been overused - I like a good Cinderella story. Key word: a GOOD Cinderella story. What makes the old motif work? Hmmm... well, so I hear, it usually works when the main lovers can make you think that they are at least moderately - and for a somewhat valid reason - attracted to each other. Hmmm... also I think that, at minimum, at least one character should be developed beyond name and face. But what do I know?While I'm at it, why don't I address the whole pity-the-minority motif. Its a delicate subject and just as much as latinos and african americans don't want us to stereo-type them, we'd rather not be stereo-typed as the rich, blonde egotists who sneer down upon maids and minorities while making fools of ourselves around everyone else. Its an issue, yes. It needs to be addressed, yes.

736660,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B0000897EE,Tucker Andersen,"[1, 3]","This is an enjoyable light comedy that unfortunately underutilizes the potential of a good idea and fine performances by several of the actors. Jennifer Lopez is Marissa Ventura, a Puerto Rican single mother from the Bronx, who is a maid in the super-luxury Beresford hotel (played by the easily recognizable Waldorf Astoria). Christopher Marshall (Ralph Fiennes), a rich aspiring politician, meets her under circumstances such that he believes that she is a guest at the hotel. As you can surmise, complications quickly ensue as her attempts to conceal her real identity from him provide the opportunity for numerous episodes of comic relief. The supporting cast is also quite good; it includes Stanley Tucci as Jerry Siegel, Chris' stereotypical political advisor, Bob Hoskins as a wonderfully correct butler, and Natasha Richardson as Caroline Lane, the rich middleaged society broad who is attempting to snare Chris. However, Tyler Garcia Posey who plays Marissa's son Ty almost steals the show and is the glue that holds the story together as the link between Marissa and Chris.Unfortunately, despite occasional attempts to interject serious topics into the film (primarily the subplot revolving around Marissa's determination to prove herself capable of entering the hotel's management ranks and also Chris' efforts to aid Marissa's attempts to develop Ty's self confidence), the  movie is basically written and directed as a modern day fairy tale. Ty meets Chris and his dog by chance; Ty introduces Chris to his mom; Chris thinks Ty is neat and Marissa is beautiful; Jerry Siegel is apoplectic that Chris' affair will interfere with his political campaign; Marissa looks georgeous as Chris' date at the big charity affair; Chris learns the truth and Marissa is fired from her job; and then to the great surprise of everyone Ty is clever enough to get them to start all over again. There is never the slighest doubt about how it will turn out and all conflict and pain is minimized almost to the point of nonexistence. One other minor complaint is that in contrast with many romantic comedies the music on the soundtrack is surprisingly sparse and adds almost nothing to the movie.So if you want to smile a lot and laugh occasionally, this is a thoroughly enjoyable light as air film. In a season of epics (THE TWO TOWERS), action movies (DIE ANOTHER DAY), thrillers (STAR TREK NEMESIS), incredibly serious subjects (GANGS OF NEW YORK), and comedies that rely on overt sexual innuendo (THE HOT CHICK) and incredibly foul language (ANALYZE THAT), this is just very bland, good clean fun.

The basic formula was carried forth to the present in this film, with modern touches applied.Jennifer Lopez is a busy single mother bringing up a precocious youngster with a penchant for seventies' history who becomes knowledgeable about Richard Nixon and his administration.  His mother, after growing up in a poor family in the Bronx, rubs elbows with luxury daily in her job as a maid in the famous Waldorf Astoria Hotel, which is given another name for the film.  Those of us who are fascinated by the exciting pace of Manhattan can easily find this film interesting for that reason alone, in that much of the movie is based at the Waldorf, home to the likes of President Herbert Hoover and General Douglas MacArthur.  While Lopez is ambitious and would like to rise to  managerial ranks, she is a little shy about it, and so a fellow maid impressed by her potential fills out an application in her name when, after the departure of an employee, a management position becomes available.Just as Lopez begins thinking about a move up the ladder she meets Ralph Fiennes, a wealthy and dashing New York Assemblyman who is running for United States Senator.  She meets him under pretenses that are false, but not of her own choosing, after he comes to the hotel to stay as a guest and sees her in a beautiful outfit.  He assumes that she is wealthy, but the outfit was borrowed from a wealthy guest out of the room at the time.  She puts it on after her friend begs her to, explaining that it will do no harm and the owner will never know.Contretemps are set into motion wherein Lopez' seemingly harmless act is discovered.  Not only is her potential rise to the management level jeopardized; Fiennes's high profile status makes the maid's problems a major story in New York City thanks to the tabloids and vigilant photographers.  Their budding romance is seemingly cut off at the pass as he turns his attentions, albeit with difficulty given his feelings for her, back to his senatorial quest.That precocious son of the Manhattan maid surfaces at just the right moment, talking to the prominent politician, asking him, ""Can't a person make a mistake and be sorry?""  It was obvious from the beginning given the nature of the story that these two would ultimately get together.

It wasn't as bad as I thought is was going to be. The movie was very predictable. No surprise, but still kept my attention. Jennifer Lopez is in her element playing a working class mom, opposed to upper-class Italians (Wedding Planner) or ballroom teachers (Shall We Dance?). Ralph Feines added a touch of class to the movie. Natasha Richardson provided the only humor in the movie. The little kid was pretty good. For J.Lo fans, she looked amazing towards the end.All in all, nothing new or groundbreaking, but maybe it's a movieto watch when there's nothing else on.",2,2.5 Stars is more appropriate,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,699,"['wife', 'wanted', 'see', '70+', 'grandmother', 'thought', 'was', 'greatest', 'movie', 'slice', 'bread', 'had', 'watch', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'predictable', 'surprise', 'still', 'kept', 'attention', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'element', 'playing', 'working', 'class', 'mom', 'opposed', 'upper-class', 'Italians', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'ballroom', 'teachers', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'Ralph', 'Feines', 'added', 'touch', 'class', 'movie', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'provided', 'only', 'humor', 'movie', 'little', 'kid', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'J.Lo', 'fans', 'looked', 'amazing', 'end.All', 'nothing', 'new', 'groundbreaking', 'movieto', 'watch', 'when', 'nothing', 'else']",N/A
