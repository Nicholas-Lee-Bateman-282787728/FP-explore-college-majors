Low quality production values, children playing the roles of adults and banal, predictable ""out-of-sync-with-video"" dialogue forced me to stop watching the dvd after about 30 minutes! I was expecting something along the lines of ""Joan of Arc.""  This movie, however, did not capture or hold my interest as an adult at all.  Now, perhaps children would find the movie worthwhile. but I did not. It was a big waste of my money and time.  The production reminded me of the TV series ""Little House on the Prairie"" which I enjoyed very much but ""Vendee"" was much worse.  I do not recommend it - especially for adults.",1,Disappointed,1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,685,"['orthodox', 'practicing', 'Catholic', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Low', 'quality', 'production', 'values', 'children', 'playing', 'roles', 'adults', 'banal', 'predictable', 'out-of-sync-with-video', 'dialogue', 'forced', 'stop', 'watching', 'dvd', '30', 'minutes', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'lines', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'movie', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'capture', 'hold', 'interest', 'adult', 'Now', 'perhaps', 'children', 'would', 'find', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'big', 'waste', 'money', 'time', 'production', 'reminded', 'TV', 'series', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'Vendee', 'was', 'much', 'worse', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'especially', 'adults']",The War of the Vendee

Michael,"[2, 2]","The War of the Vendee needs to be remembered by history, but I am just one of those people who wasn't particularly moved by this movie, which was acted entirely by children and young adolescents. Don't get me wrong- everyone involved deserves kudos for a clean, pious and historically significant drama, but what it amounted to in the end was a high school play with quasi-Hollywood production value. The one exception for me was the scene in which the Martyrs of Compi&egrave;gne defied their Revolutionary judge and embraced their fate. The actress playing their Mother Superior was very good and created a moving and emotional scene. I'd recommend supporting this worthy movie, not necessarily for its technical excellence but for its holy message, the earnest efforts of its actors and off-camera producers, and for the Cause of the Cross.",3,A high school play with Hollywood production value,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,843,"['War', 'Vendee', 'be', 'remembered', 'history', 'am', 'just', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'moved', 'movie', 'was', 'acted', 'entirely', 'children', 'young', 'adolescents', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong-', 'everyone', 'involved', 'deserves', 'kudos', 'clean', 'pious', 'historically', 'significant', 'drama', 'what', 'amounted', 'end', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'quasi-Hollywood', 'production', 'value', 'one', 'exception', 'was', 'scene', 'Martyrs', 'Compi', 'egrave', 'gne', 'defied', 'Revolutionary', 'judge', 'embraced', 'fate', 'actress', 'playing', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'created', 'moving', 'emotional', 'scene', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'supporting', 'worthy', 'movie', 'not', 'necessarily', 'technical', 'excellence', 'holy', 'message', 'earnest', 'efforts', 'actors', 'off-camera', 'producers', 'Cause', 'Cross']",The War of the Vendee

I have to say it's become the kid's second favorite movie... right behind Tin-Tin!  There was a lot of giggling initially when they saw that kids were playing all the parts, and at some of the things the kids do... the kids thought it was funny because it wasn't as ""real"".  It's now become a favorite and I have no issues with it as well.From an adults standpoint: if you are looking for a movie for you, pass on it. It's all children who are acting and so there are teens of the same age playing grandmother, mother and teenage daughter. This is silly and confusing from a ""regular movie"" standpoint. The plot is solid and good, but again, the production is not high quality. VERY good for how they made it, etc... but more on the level of a VERY well-acted out play as opposed to a traditional movie. That being said their musical scores were the exception to this... they were REALLY well done and I highly applaud who did them!!!  And most importantly for me, it teaches a very good, Catholic story in a way that is COMPLETELY safe from this ultra-protective Traditional Catholic mom's standpoint!  That in and of itself is a huge plus and I appreciate that they did that.  I love that I can hand it to the kids with ease.But of course it's not the adult's standpoint that's important because we are not the audience. The kids are thrilled with the idea that other homeschool families like them made this movie; they can connect more with the characters because of this standpoint as well.  They like seeing all the cute little siblings of the main actors and enjoy seeing them participate in the acting. The story is very attractive to them and teaches them honor and respect, etc... and history as well (which happened to coincide with my 5th grade daughter's MODG history... a HUGE plus!). And the bloopers... DEFINITELY KEEP THIS UP... the kids LOVED them and even us adults did. Those are actually some of my fav. things on a dvd and I am so glad to see the extensive ones here.So I highly recommend it for the other Catholic homeschoolers out there and I will gladly buy up any of their other productions for the kid's Christmas and Easter presents!",5,Great for the kids... they watch it constantly!

The story of the movie is very good for lifting up morals and reminding you that we must all fight for what is right. but as it says on the DVD itself, it is not really the way it happened. So if you are looking for an accurate historical movie about the french war this is not the movie for you.
