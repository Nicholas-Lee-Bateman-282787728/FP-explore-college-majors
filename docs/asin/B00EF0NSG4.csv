1667088,A2UWAMILXW2PR3,B00EF0NSG4,"patricio ""book lover""","[2, 4]",I love this and have been working out one week and already my waist has decreased and it was not thick to begin with! What he says makes complete sense and I have been lucky in that I sensed the correct way to exercise and had already been applying myself and then this comes along and it is even better and in a very short period of time am seeing results! I also like Edward as he gets to the point and does not sugar coat the truth about exercise and what you have to do to get fit. He is in great shape himself and a fine looking man and what a body! I highly recommend this and I notice there are naysayers who disparage him but if they would just do the workout they would sing a different tune. Some people just do not want to do what they should and instead they live in denial about why they are not fit and trim.,5,Terrific!,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,822,"['love', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'one', 'week', 'already', 'waist', 'decreased', 'was', 'not', 'thick', 'begin', 'What', 'complete', 'sense', 'have', 'been', 'lucky', 'sensed', 'correct', 'way', 'exercise', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'applying', 'then', 'along', 'even', 'better', 'very', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'am', 'seeing', 'results', 'also', 'like', 'Edward', 'point', 'not', 'sugar', 'coat', 'truth', 'exercise', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'get', 'fit', 'great', 'shape', 'fine', 'looking', 'man', 'what', 'body', 'highly', 'recommend', 'notice', 'are', 'naysayers', 'who', 'disparage', 'would', 'just', 'do', 'workout', 'would', 'sing', 'different', 'tune', 'people', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'what', 'should', 'instead', 'live', 'denial', 'why', 'are', 'not', 'fit', 'trim']",ESCAPE YOUR SHAPE: 21-DAY BODY MAKEOVER

Once I got there and was able to determine I was a &#34;Ruler&#34;. I did both Ruler Levels 1 & 2 that day. They are only 20 minutes each; meaning 40 minutes only for your body type. I did enjoy the Level 1 workout - it starts out with 6 minutes of aerobic/cardio excercises, then the next 14 minutes with abs, 1 min cardio, arms, legs, 1 min cardio...cooldown. Time went by very fast. Level 2 had the same beginning - the same 6 mins of Cardio, (I was hoping it was different) with a tougher ab workout for sure, and then the same type of 14 min routine but with different moves (other than the abs, it didn't feel tougher). It is by no means an intermediate or hard core workout. I liked the variety of moves and will use this DVD in my workout rotation.",4,I'm a Ruler,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,903,"['Well', 'am', 'new', 'working', 'out', 'body', 'introduction', 'determing', 'what', 'body', 'type', 'was', 'was', 'bit', 'cumbersome', 'navigating', 'DVD', 'Once', 'got', 'there', 'was', 'able', 'determine', 'was', '34', 'Ruler', '34', 'did', 'Ruler', 'Levels', '1', '2', 'day', 'are', 'only', '20', 'minutes', 'meaning', '40', 'minutes', 'only', 'body', 'type', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Level', '1', 'out', '6', 'minutes', 'aerobic/cardio', 'excercises', 'then', 'next', '14', 'minutes', 'abs', '1', 'min', 'cardio', 'arms', 'legs', '1', 'min', 'cardio', 'cooldown', 'Time', 'went', 'very', 'fast', 'Level', '2', 'had', 'same', 'beginning', 'same', '6', 'mins', 'Cardio', 'was', 'hoping', 'was', 'different', 'tougher', 'ab', 'workout', 'sure', 'then', 'same', 'type', '14', 'min', 'routine', 'different', 'moves', 'other', 'abs', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'tougher', 'means', 'intermediate', 'hard', 'core', 'workout', 'liked', 'variety', 'moves', 'will', 'use', 'DVD', 'workout', 'rotation']",ESCAPE YOUR SHAPE: 21-DAY BODY MAKEOVER

Not too over the top to leave you exhausted; but enough to definately feel it the next day. I am trying to get back on the regular workout wagon; and this is perfect for someone who isn't incredibly out of shape.It is a blend of aerobic intervals with standing and floor Pilates type movements. I haven't been doing it the 21 days yet but I like a workout that doesn't completely kick your butt and still feels like you are getting somewhere.You can vary the speed of your movements to up the intensity as you wish.I do wish there was a little better explanation of the 3 different body types; as i have a hard time looking in the mirror these days and being able to tell due to the flab I feel like i have seems to be everywhere. haa.,4,Pleasantly surprised!,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,902,"['was', 'disappointed', '3', 'days', 'ordered', 'price', 'dropped', '4', 'o', 'well', 'happens.However', 'am', 'amazed', 'how', '20', 'minutes', 'workouts', 'are', 'great', 'Not', 'too', 'top', 'leave', 'exhausted', 'enough', 'definately', 'feel', 'next', 'day', 'am', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'regular', 'workout', 'wagon', 'perfect', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'incredibly', 'shape.It', 'blend', 'aerobic', 'intervals', 'standing', 'floor', 'Pilates', 'type', 'movements', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'doing', '21', 'days', 'yet', 'like', 'workout', ""n't"", 'completely', 'kick', 'butt', 'still', 'feels', 'are', 'getting', 'somewhere.You', 'can', 'vary', 'speed', 'movements', 'intensity', 'wish.I', 'do', 'wish', 'was', 'little', 'better', 'explanation', '3', 'different', 'body', 'types', 'i', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'looking', 'mirror', 'days', 'being', 'able', 'tell', 'due', 'flab', 'feel', 'i', 'have', 'be', 'everywhere', 'haa']",ESCAPE YOUR SHAPE: 21-DAY BODY MAKEOVER
