1072105,AY7EXIYJ2LG5S,B000PKG8TM,ADSHippin,"[9, 11]","After watching this film the word that comes to mind is WOW!As a young child I frequently had a similar fantasy myself about stopping time and going on all sorts of adventures.  So after seeing this film on the shelves of Target I became rather intrigued by the story, and after doing a bit of research I purchased it.What we have is an incredible well written film that somehow combines the painful emotions of a break up, a love story, some comedy, a little mental fantasy and even a touch of sci-fi.  Unlike many other films that try to do this, Cashback succeeds with this mix rather spectacularly.Most of us know the pain of a broken heart, and Sean Biggerstaff who plays Ben certainly manages to capture that feeling.  The constant memory triggers, the lack of sleep and constant wondering where our lost love is, what they are doing.  Even worse for poor Ben is that he is the cause of his own heart ache.  Optimistically he realizes his mistake and comes to terms with it. He also has the good fortune of discovering new love in the form of Sharon played by the delightful Emily Fox.About the only thing I didn't like about this film is that it seems a little slow in some parts.  However it features a terrific happy ending that leaves us wondering if Ben's mental fantasies are indeed just fantasies, or are in fact reality.  Remember what I said about sci-fi?One the more pleasant surprises is Michelle Ryan from more recent fame as the new Bionic Woman playing Suzie the woman Ben leaves.  Don't get your hopes boys and girls though there is plenty of female nudity in this film;  Ms. Ryan keeps her clothes on.  On the funny side in the opening Suzie launches in a silenced verbal tirade against poor silly Ben (breaking up with Michelle Ryan what are you on drugs?).  This tirade as we discover after the DVD and in the extra features section, is every bit as caustic as it looks.  Fans of the new Bionic Woman, some of whom questioned her lack of an English accent in that show can also feel rest assured about her nationality.Word of Caution to those who are easily offended by nudity and language.  There is an abundance of both in this terrific little film.Enjoy...",4,A terrific little movie...,1196640000,"12 3, 2007",2007,2183,"['watching', 'film', 'word', 'mind', 'WOW', 'young', 'child', 'frequently', 'had', 'similar', 'fantasy', 'stopping', 'time', 'going', 'sorts', 'adventures', 'So', 'seeing', 'film', 'shelves', 'Target', 'became', 'rather', 'intrigued', 'story', 'doing', 'bit', 'research', 'purchased', 'have', 'incredible', 'well', 'written', 'film', 'somehow', 'painful', 'emotions', 'break', 'up', 'love', 'story', 'comedy', 'little', 'mental', 'fantasy', 'even', 'touch', 'sci-fi', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'try', 'do', 'Cashback', 'mix', 'rather', 'spectacularly.Most', 'know', 'pain', 'broken', 'heart', 'Sean', 'Biggerstaff', 'who', 'Ben', 'certainly', 'capture', 'feeling', 'constant', 'memory', 'triggers', 'lack', 'sleep', 'constant', 'wondering', 'where', 'lost', 'love', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Even', 'worse', 'poor', 'Ben', 'cause', 'own', 'heart', 'ache', 'Optimistically', 'mistake', 'terms', 'also', 'good', 'fortune', 'discovering', 'new', 'love', 'form', 'Sharon', 'played', 'delightful', 'Emily', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'little', 'slow', 'parts', 'However', 'terrific', 'happy', 'ending', 'wondering', 'Ben', 'mental', 'fantasies', 'are', 'indeed', 'just', 'fantasies', 'are', 'fact', 'reality', 'Remember', 'what', 'said', 'sci-fi', 'One', 'more', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'Michelle', 'Ryan', 'more', 'recent', 'fame', 'new', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'playing', 'Suzie', 'woman', 'Ben', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', 'boys', 'girls', 'plenty', 'female', 'nudity', 'film', 'Ms.', 'Ryan', 'clothes', 'funny', 'side', 'opening', 'Suzie', 'silenced', 'verbal', 'tirade', 'poor', 'silly', 'Ben', 'breaking', 'up', 'Michelle', 'Ryan', 'what', 'are', 'drugs', 'tirade', 'discover', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'section', 'bit', 'as', 'caustic', 'Fans', 'new', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'whom', 'questioned', 'lack', 'English', 'accent', 'show', 'can', 'also', 'feel', 'rest', 'assured', 'nationality.Word', 'Caution', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'nudity', 'language', 'abundance', 'terrific', 'little', 'film.Enjoy']",Cashback

Fierro,"[4, 5]","Cash Back is a love story, drama, comedy that is amazingly entertaining and heartfelt because of the way it pulls the viewer into its story line, through love.  This movie is a work of art in itself, from the way that you live inside the mind and heart of Ben, the main character.  Throughout the movie Ben has the ability to stop time, at least in his head he does, and through this ability he is able to create his hand drawings.  What makes this movie very enjoyable is that I felt the plot and the story were fully developed for each character, even though its only 1 hour and 42 minutes long.  As you get to understand Ben, how he views the world through the mind of an artist and how his inspiration is created by the curves of the female body.

Sure, you have elements of a romance comedy thrown into this film, with even a final word on love at the very end of the film.  But to me, the main course in this meal is the male fantasy of the female body, and everything else is just side orders.The film makes a valiant attempt to explain this fascination, via the main character's flashbacks of childhood experiences such as having a Swedish roommate in the house or checking out adult magazines with his best friend.

Taking a major male fantasy ('freezing' time, then undressing beautiful women in a public place), has pretty obvious 'sleaze' potential, but Ellis' protagonist, supermarket salesclerk/budding artist Ben (Sean Biggerstaff), clearly uses his fantasy for simply recreating the feminine mystique in nude sketches, not for any physical gratification (of course, if this were entirely true, all of his 'models' would not have been knockouts...which they are), and to playfully pull pranks on co-workers. The feature builds upon the employees, Ben's budding relationship with Sharon (Emilia Fox), and the realm of fantasy his hidden psychic abilities creates for the pair.While the intimacy of the original is missed (the short is, in fact, included in the DVD, so you can check out both versions), I really liked the feature, and I believe you will enjoy it, as well!",4,Surprisingly Entertaining 'Male Fantasy' Comedy!,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,1219,"['When', 'Sean', 'Ellis', 'low-budgeted', 'short', 'Cashback', 'became', 'hit', 'Indie', 'Award', 'circuit', 'was', 'expected', ""'d"", 'be', 'offered', 'opportunity', 'expand', 'feature', 'sure', 'enough', 'happened', 'credit', 'Ellis', 'largely', 'kept', 'fidelity', 'material', 'wit', 'off-the-wall', 'viewpoint', 'surprisingly', 'inoffensive', 'sexiness', 'Taking', 'major', 'male', 'fantasy', ""'freezing"", 'time', 'then', 'undressing', 'beautiful', 'women', 'public', 'place', 'pretty', 'obvious', ""'sleaze"", 'potential', 'Ellis', 'protagonist', 'supermarket', 'salesclerk/budding', 'artist', 'Ben', 'Sean', 'Biggerstaff', 'clearly', 'fantasy', 'simply', 'recreating', 'feminine', 'mystique', 'nude', 'sketches', 'not', 'physical', 'gratification', 'course', 'were', 'entirely', 'true', ""'models"", 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'knockouts', 'are', 'playfully', 'pull', 'pranks', 'co-workers', 'feature', 'employees', 'Ben', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Sharon', 'Emilia', 'Fox', 'realm', 'fantasy', 'hidden', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'pair.While', 'intimacy', 'original', 'missed', 'short', 'fact', 'included', 'DVD', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'versions', 'really', 'liked', 'feature', 'believe', 'will', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well']",Cashback

He's got quite an imagination and is able to sort of &#34;stop time&#34; wherein everyone freezes but him. He can walk around the other people, take his time drawing or painting them, and ultimately get the view of the world he wants.

HOWEVER, it was the cogent and intelligent comments here (on Amazon) that succeeded in clueing me in to a sensitively written high-brow gem of a movie, which I promptly purchased, and just finished enjoying.Yes, Ellis' movie has the obligatory dysfunctional 'characters', and  sophomoric humor, required to keep what Shakespeare called his audience's ""peanut gallery"" contingent entertained ... thus freeing him to tell the deeper tale to the rest of the audience in peace.In this instance, the story revolves around an intelligent, and very introspective, young art student who, shell-shocked from breaking up with his {superficially} beautiful girlfriend, goes through an emotional recovery phase (and a severe bout of profound insomnia) in which his understandings of ""beauty"" (both superficial and inner), and his perception time itself, shatter and rearrange themselves in surreal fashion into a new, deeper, and more mature awareness.{By the way, the movie title is something of a double pun - the main character, as a result of his insomnia, uses his sleepless hours to work the graveyard shift at a local supermarket, theyeby getting 'cashback' on his surplus time (which seems to drag interminably) ... also, his new love interest, the cashier in same store, asks customers if they want 'cashback' on the card they use for their purchase.}Anyway, it's a great avante garde movie.  Ellis deftly uses the combination of feminine beauty, and surreal time perception, as a sort of visual zen-koan, in order to help the viewer better empathize with the main character's attempts to reassess both concepts with his artistic mental microscope (like a microbiologist trying to study what's ailing him).  If you've ever been through a near death experience, a major accident, or a particularly deep & memorable emotional experience (good or bad), you'll have a leg up on grasping the slow-motion 'train wreck' altered-state-of-awareness effect (and it's aftermanth) that often accompanies such experiences, and how they often replay themselves over and over again in your mind ... sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes timeless.It's well done, and very enjoyable.

His social skills are not matched by his artistry, however, as he struggles to connect with girls.The film opens with a striking scene -  a high speed shot, played back in slow motion and accompanied by the glorious singing of an opera soprano, magnifying the contortions in the face of Ben's girlfriend as she hurls obscenities and a coffee mug and then a lamp at him.  The shot is repeated again near the end of the movie as another of Ben's girlfriends also shrieks at him in slow motion.In between, Ben, having become an insomniac over his breakup with his girlfriend, discovers the power to stop time, a power which he uses to further explore his obsession with the female form.  Here, the movie shows off lots of beautiful women in various states of undress.And this is the true genius of this film, to show the dichotomy of women, that they can be so lovely to men when calm and naked, and also be so capable of turning into these raging demons from hell.At the grocery store, Ben falls for a pretty cashier named Sharon and then almost loses her over a trivial incident.The finale to the film is breathtaking in its beauty and artistry.  Sharon reconnects with Ben at an art gallery.  With a kiss he brings her into his stop-action world, and they walk into a suspended snowfall, hand in hand, pushing through the snowflakes hanging in mid-air, glittering like diamonds in the moonlight.  Ben's voiceover at the end lingers in the soul......Once upon a time I wanted to know what love was.  Love is there if you want it to be.  You just have to see that it's wrapped in beauty and hidden away between the seconds of your life.  If you don't stop for a minute, you might miss it...(Note: The beautiful song at the end is an orchestral remix of ""She"" by Grand Avenue, a Dutch band.

In fact, it has lurched into the pantheon of my all-time favorite movies!  It is a somewhat odd mixture of diverse ingredients, with elements ofOffice Space - Special Edition with Flair (Widescreen Edition)andHigh Fidelityand even some allusions toGladiator (Widescreen Edition)thrown in just for fun.  On top of that, much of it makes you feel like you're in the Twilight Zone, yet there's some downright slap-stick comedy that is stirred in for one amazing concoction of a story!The DVD details the life of an artist (Sean Biggerstaff) who is having an awful time getting over his ex-girlfriend who just dumped him.  He's having such a rough time, in fact, that he can't sleep.  I mean, literally - he has the worst case of insomnia the world has ever seen.  Finally, he gets a job working 3rd shift at a supermarket, just for something to do.While there he meets up with a very pretty cashier (Emilia Fox) and some just plain crazy co-workers.  He looks at even something as banal as working in a grocery store as being an ""artistic"" (if not metaphysical?) experience, and finds himself gravitating towards the lovely blonde cashier.At the base, what this movie seems to be ""all about"" to me is a sort of meditation on feminine beauty, and the way that (straight) men perceive that beauty.  Yes, this includes the female nude, but in an artistic way as opposed to being sleazy.  The film is full of useful flashbacks that help us understand the evolution of an artist's perception of women.  Many of these flashbacks,in fact, I could relate to in my own life.Be warned that this is a very ""different"" sort of movie.  Being an independent film, it goes well off of the beaten-track, and to me that's a good thing.  While I'm sure there are plenty of people who will watch this and say ""Boy, that was weird"" I'm also confident that there are many who will say ""Wow, I'd like to see more introspective flicks like that!""

It's a weak defense used to cover up guilt and  I think it's how the main character Ben (Sean Biggerstaff) is able to defend his actions in this British comedy.Needing to pass time during a  painful breakup, Ben figures out a way to freeze time so he can undress young women and draw their naked bodies.He defends himself by saying he's just appreciating their beauty and hopes they don't mind (though he doesn't bother to ask if they do mind).First of all, if he wanted to study beauty, then he'd study these women's unique faces and their treatment towards others, not their breasts and naked bodies.  When a woman is naked and flashing her bare breasts, it doesn't really matter if she's beautiful inside and out.  She'll still arouse a man sexually.  And in this case, even more so because the women he defined as beautiful were also fertile, firm-bodied 20-year olds.Second, if he was interested in drawing the naked female form, why didn't he just draw the nudes in art class?  These female nudes have already consented to having their naked bodies drawn by artists.Or why not draw the naked bodies in magazines like Playboy?  Again, these are female nudes who have already consented to having their naked bodies viewed by others.Or if it was these specific women he wanted to draw, why not just ask their consent to draw them in the nude?I think he doesn't  choose any of these routes  because it's not about capturing beauty  like an artist.  It's about wanting to control these women  like a voyeur.Freezing these women immobilizes them in place...allowing him to bypass their consent so he can undress them on his terms.After he dresses and unfreezes them, these women feel kind of weird, but have no idea that their privacy has just been violated.Although what he's done isn't as invasive as slipping a woman a date rape drug and raping her while she's unconscious, it had the same creepy vibe to it.It seemed like Ben was learning his lesson, though, because he's unable to freeze his love interest.  I think he couldn't freeze her because he knew he needed her consent before he could undress her.This movie had it's funny moments, mostly from Ben's perverted best friend and Ben's co-workers.  There's also a nice artistic shot where Ben floats from his phone to his vertical bed.I also liked that we see a man mourning so deeply over a breakup.  Usually, you only see a woman mourn this deeply, so it was refreshing to show that a man really does care about these things.However, this movie is way too long.  I thought the drawn out soccer scene could've been eliminated altogether.So overall, this movie is just okay and could've been better without the freezing trick and if it had been much shorter in length.",3,Is this a movie about capturing beauty...or about wanting control?,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,2826,"['**REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS**Have', 'ever', 'heard', 'saying', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'weak', 'defense', 'used', 'cover', 'up', 'guilt', 'think', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'Ben', 'Sean', 'Biggerstaff', 'able', 'defend', 'actions', 'British', 'comedy.Needing', 'pass', 'time', 'painful', 'breakup', 'Ben', 'out', 'way', 'freeze', 'time', 'can', 'undress', 'young', 'women', 'draw', 'naked', 'bodies.He', 'saying', 'just', 'appreciating', 'beauty', 'hopes', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', ""n't"", 'bother', 'ask', 'do', 'mind', '.First', 'wanted', 'study', 'beauty', 'then', ""'d"", 'study', 'women', 'unique', 'treatment', 'others', 'not', 'breasts', 'naked', 'bodies', 'When', 'woman', 'naked', 'flashing', 'bare', 'breasts', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'beautiful', 'inside', 'out', ""'ll"", 'still', 'arouse', 'man', 'sexually', 'case', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'women', 'defined', 'beautiful', 'were', 'also', 'fertile', 'firm-bodied', '20-year', 'olds.Second', 'was', 'interested', 'drawing', 'naked', 'female', 'form', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'draw', 'nudes', 'art', 'class', 'female', 'nudes', 'have', 'already', 'consented', 'having', 'naked', 'bodies', 'drawn', 'artists.Or', 'why', 'not', 'draw', 'naked', 'bodies', 'magazines', 'Playboy', 'Again', 'are', 'female', 'nudes', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'consented', 'having', 'naked', 'bodies', 'viewed', 'others.Or', 'was', 'specific', 'women', 'wanted', 'draw', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'ask', 'consent', 'draw', 'nude', 'think', ""n't"", 'choose', 'routes', 'not', 'capturing', 'beauty', 'artist', 'wanting', 'control', 'women', 'voyeur.Freezing', 'women', 'immobilizes', 'place', 'allowing', 'bypass', 'consent', 'can', 'undress', 'terms.After', 'women', 'feel', 'kind', 'weird', 'have', 'idea', 'privacy', 'just', 'been', 'violated.Although', 'what', 'done', ""n't"", 'as', 'invasive', 'slipping', 'woman', 'date', 'rape', 'drug', 'raping', 'unconscious', 'had', 'same', 'creepy', 'vibe', 'it.It', 'seemed', 'Ben', 'was', 'learning', 'lesson', 'though', 'unable', 'freeze', 'love', 'interest', 'think', 'could', ""n't"", 'freeze', 'knew', 'needed', 'consent', 'could', 'undress', 'her.This', 'movie', 'had', 'funny', 'moments', 'mostly', 'Ben', 'perverted', 'best', 'friend', 'Ben', 'co-workers', 'also', 'nice', 'artistic', 'shot', 'where', 'Ben', 'phone', 'vertical', 'bed.I', 'also', 'liked', 'see', 'man', 'mourning', 'so', 'deeply', 'breakup', 'Usually', 'only', 'see', 'woman', 'mourn', 'deeply', 'was', 'refreshing', 'show', 'man', 'really', 'care', 'things.However', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'thought', 'drawn', 'out', 'soccer', 'scene', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'eliminated', 'overall', 'movie', 'just', 'okay', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'freezing', 'trick', 'had', 'been', 'much', 'shorter', 'length']",Cashback

But, somehow, it felt good at the end. Sort of like eating a peanut butter and bacon sandwich.Here's the scoop. Ben is a budding art student who has just been dumped by his girlfriend. It really threw him for a loop so now he can't sleep. He gets a job on the night shift at a local grocery to fill the time. The sleep deprivation, and accompanying dementia, give him the impression that he can freeze time and move freely within the frozen frame. He begins a relationship with a co-worker and puts up with the antics of his boss and fellow workers.As I said, this is an odd mix. On one hand you have a protagonist that is an insightful character with whom you have a great deal of empathy. He reviews his life and how he came to appreciate the female form and how that urged him into the world of art. On the other hand you have these goofball co-workers and situations you would expect to find in a movie with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. These are funny scenes but they feel as though they belong in some other movie. Be that as it may, this is still a fun watch. The characters a colorful. There is a nice amount of female beauty on display. And, for my dollar, the end was satisfying.This might be more three and a half than the four stars I gave it but it's still well worth the time invested to watch it.",4,Odd Mix,1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,1435,"['one', 'tough', 'call', 'together', 'couple', 'different', 'types', 'movies', 'surface', 'might', 'seem', 'odds', 'somehow', 'felt', 'good', 'end', 'Sort', 'eating', 'peanut', 'butter', 'bacon', 'sandwich.Here', 'scoop', 'Ben', 'budding', 'art', 'student', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'dumped', 'girlfriend', 'really', 'threw', 'loop', 'so', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'job', 'night', 'shift', 'local', 'grocery', 'fill', 'time', 'sleep', 'deprivation', 'accompanying', 'dementia', 'give', 'impression', 'can', 'freeze', 'time', 'move', 'freely', 'frozen', 'frame', 'relationship', 'co-worker', 'up', 'antics', 'boss', 'fellow', 'workers.As', 'said', 'odd', 'mix', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'protagonist', 'insightful', 'character', 'whom', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'empathy', 'life', 'how', 'came', 'appreciate', 'female', 'form', 'how', 'urged', 'world', 'art', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'goofball', 'co-workers', 'situations', 'would', 'expect', 'find', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'are', 'funny', 'scenes', 'feel', 'belong', 'other', 'movie', 'Be', 'may', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'characters', 'colorful', 'nice', 'amount', 'female', 'beauty', 'display', 'dollar', 'end', 'was', 'satisfying.This', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'three', 'half', 'four', 'stars', 'gave', 'still', 'well', 'time', 'invested', 'watch']",Cashback

It was incredibly well done with some very cool special effects (not action scenes).  The acting flows easily and you really feel like you are a fly on the wall watching their life the story moves so effortlessly.  The beauty of the film is its study of relationships, time and our dreams; how we approach them and basically how well we spend our short time on this earth.  So it has these deeper issues flowing underneath a funny comedy.  The goofy co-workers and his best friend are funny but not outlandish or unbelievable.  In my humble opinion the negative reviews seem almost exclusively due to the nudity (there is a fair amount of nudity in the middle of the film) but they have missed the point of the film completely.  In my own view I would love to see some more modesty in our culture and prefer the old 50's classy styles to todays tight and cleavage showing dress but it still doesn't distract from the awesome acting and powerful goals of this film.

1072143,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000PKG8TM,K. Driscoll,"[48, 52]","This is Sean Ellis's Academy Award nominatedshort filmCashback expanded into feature film.  Cashback is a comedy first and foremost, and it is about an art school student and aspiring artist named Ben (Sean Biggerstaff), who recently suffered a breakup with his girlfriend of several years.  Because of the break up Ben cannot sleep for over the course of several weeks and this is the time period of Ben's life that we see and he narrates for us.  Ben gets a job at a grocery store to pass his time.  He often imagines stopping time completely and creating his still life art.  In fact, as the film goes one we begin to wonder if he really can stop time or not.  Soon Ben begins to fall for a clerk named Sharon (Emilia Fox) and his episodic insomnia gets resolved.Cashback is rich with great characters and some hilarious moments.  Ben is dry enough to fittingly suffer through his many experiences, all the while his flat reactions to these other brighter characters is comedic in and of itself.  Ben's friend from childhood Shaun (Sean Higgins) is an amusing womanizer who seems completely at peace with the fact that most women will harshly reject his obnoxious advances.  Ben's boss Jenkins (Stuart Goodwin) is an absurdly arrogant person that also seems entirely unwavered by his failures to pursue Sharon, or even win a football game against a competing grocery store.  Barry and Matt (Michael Dixon and Michael Lambourne) are two colleagues of Ben's who are constantly being ridiculously mischievous and make for some of the film's best laughs.  Another colleague of Ben's is Brian (Marc Pickering) whose kung-fu training defines him as a person.  This is obviously a character-driven comedy, but it is the development of these characters that makes the more subdued drama work to its advantage.The short film, which is on this DVD as well, is basically comprised of the scene in the film where we first meet and establish these colorful characters.  It is the most engaging part of the movie.  The only difference between the segment in the short film and the long version is that the long version is slightly edited for sexual content.  I found it strange that in the short film all the girl's are clean shaven but in the long version they suddenly have pubic hair.  Nevertheless, the feature film sliding by the MPAA with just an R-rating is still a wonderful surprise.  The standards have seemingly changed and perhaps the MPAA sees nudity as more pleasing to the eyeballs, as opposed to seeing someone's eyeballs being torn out of their head with pliers.  No matter, you get both versions with this DVD and the film's primary function isn't as a skin flick to begin with.  It is actually sort of disappointing to hear about all the nude scenes anytime I hear about this movie, although it would be silly not to point out that the nudity involves some of the most beautiful women in the world (e.g. Hayley Marie Coppin, Irene Bagach,Keeley Hazell).I've heard that director Sean Ellis is working on a horror film next with Lena Headey.  That has me curious because Ellis shows more technical ability in Cashback than we are used to seeing in most comedies and I believe he has given me reason to look out for his next project.  Cashback is both more entertaining and more vulgar than most comedies out there and it deserves credit for that.  It doesn't seem to be getting the exposure I think the film warrants as it is probably very accessible to an American audience.  I hope it catches on as I enjoyed it very much.",4,Underrated Comedy,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,3530,"['Sean', 'Ellis', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominatedshort', 'filmCashback', 'expanded', 'feature', 'film', 'Cashback', 'comedy', 'first', 'foremost', 'art', 'school', 'student', 'aspiring', 'artist', 'named', 'Ben', 'Sean', 'Biggerstaff', 'who', 'recently', 'suffered', 'breakup', 'girlfriend', 'several', 'years', 'break', 'up', 'Ben', 'can', 'not', 'sleep', 'course', 'several', 'weeks', 'time', 'period', 'Ben', 'life', 'see', 'Ben', 'job', 'grocery', 'store', 'pass', 'time', 'often', 'stopping', 'time', 'completely', 'creating', 'still', 'life', 'art', 'fact', 'film', 'one', 'begin', 'wonder', 'really', 'can', 'stop', 'time', 'not', 'Soon', 'Ben', 'fall', 'clerk', 'named', 'Sharon', 'Emilia', 'Fox', 'episodic', 'insomnia', 'resolved.Cashback', 'rich', 'great', 'characters', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'Ben', 'dry', 'enough', 'fittingly', 'suffer', 'many', 'experiences', 'flat', 'reactions', 'other', 'brighter', 'characters', 'comedic', 'Ben', 'friend', 'childhood', 'Shaun', 'Sean', 'Higgins', 'amusing', 'womanizer', 'who', 'completely', 'peace', 'fact', 'most', 'women', 'will', 'harshly', 'reject', 'obnoxious', 'advances', 'Ben', 'boss', 'Jenkins', 'Stuart', 'Goodwin', 'absurdly', 'arrogant', 'person', 'also', 'entirely', 'unwavered', 'failures', 'pursue', 'Sharon', 'even', 'win', 'football', 'game', 'competing', 'grocery', 'store', 'Barry', 'Matt', 'Michael', 'Dixon', 'Michael', 'Lambourne', 'are', 'two', 'colleagues', 'Ben', 'who', 'are', 'constantly', 'being', 'ridiculously', 'mischievous', 'make', 'film', 'best', 'laughs', 'colleague', 'Ben', 'Brian', 'Marc', 'Pickering', 'kung-fu', 'training', 'person', 'obviously', 'character-driven', 'comedy', 'development', 'characters', 'more', 'subdued', 'drama', 'work', 'advantage.The', 'short', 'film', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'basically', 'comprised', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'first', 'meet', 'establish', 'colorful', 'characters', 'most', 'engaging', 'part', 'movie', 'only', 'difference', 'segment', 'short', 'film', 'long', 'version', 'long', 'version', 'slightly', 'edited', 'sexual', 'content', 'found', 'short', 'film', 'girl', 'are', 'clean', 'shaven', 'long', 'version', 'suddenly', 'have', 'pubic', 'hair', 'Nevertheless', 'feature', 'film', 'sliding', 'MPAA', 'just', 'R-rating', 'still', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'standards', 'have', 'seemingly', 'changed', 'perhaps', 'MPAA', 'nudity', 'more', 'pleasing', 'eyeballs', 'opposed', 'seeing', 'someone', 'eyeballs', 'being', 'torn', 'head', 'pliers', 'matter', 'get', 'versions', 'DVD', 'film', 'primary', 'function', ""n't"", 'skin', 'flick', 'begin', 'actually', 'sort', 'disappointing', 'hear', 'nude', 'scenes', 'anytime', 'hear', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'silly', 'not', 'point', 'out', 'nudity', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'world', 'e.g', 'Hayley', 'Marie', 'Coppin', 'Irene', 'Bagach', 'Keeley', 'Hazell', '.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'director', 'Sean', 'Ellis', 'working', 'horror', 'film', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'curious', 'Ellis', 'more', 'technical', 'ability', 'Cashback', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'most', 'comedies', 'believe', 'given', 'reason', 'look', 'out', 'next', 'project', 'Cashback', 'more', 'entertaining', 'more', 'vulgar', 'most', 'comedies', 'out', 'there', 'credit', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'exposure', 'think', 'film', 'warrants', 'probably', 'very', 'accessible', 'American', 'audience', 'hope', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much']",Cashback

1072146,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000PKG8TM,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[4, 12]","Cashback is one of the weakest romantic comedies I have ever seen. The acting is just fair. The plot does manage to move along despite the fact that the actors weren't given much of a script to work with. The cinematography is also just average--except in the scene when the young artist Ben floats from a payphone to his bed. In short, this is a light, fluffy film that nobody should take seriously even if they like it.The action begins when a rather sensitive young artist, Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff), suffers a painful breakup with his girlfriend of over two years, Suzy (Michelle Ryan). Ben is so upset that he develops a very bad case of insomnia that leaves him unable to sleep for several weeks. Ben eventually takes a job as a night shift worker at a local supermarket to do something productive at night. It is at the supermarket that Ben meets and becomes enchanted by the lovely young checkout girl named Sharon Pintey, who is actually played rather well by Emilia Fox.Nevertheless, Ben is shy and it takes him an entirely whopping four weeks from the time he gets dumped by Suzy to the time he starts to date Sharon. Ben, the poor guy that he is, just can't seem to take two steps or even put his underwear on right unless he has a girlfriend NOW. He also begins to imagine that he can stop time so that he is the only person who can move about somewhat secretly--where will this lead him?Other complications soon develop. Ben's boss at the supermarket throws a party; and of course Ben and the rest of the night shift staff have to attend. What will Ben do when he arrives at the party with Sharon as his date--only to see that Suzy is now steadily dating his boss's younger brother? How will Sharon react to Suzy approaching Ben at the party? How does Sharon figure into the soccer match that Ben and the guys from the supermarket play against an opposing team? No plot spoilers here, folks--if you like this sort of stuff, watch the movie and find out!The DVD comes with a short version of this film; I actually recommend you watch the short instead of the feature length film.Overall, Cashback just can't avoid being a day late and a dollar short (no financial pun intended). If you like romantic comedies then you may want to give this one a try. I, however, put this one on my list of forgettable films that try to be good but just don't make it.Two stars--one star for a couple of laughs and a second star for a good performance by Emilia Fox as Ben's new girlfriend Sharon.",2,Thousands cheered--WHEN IT WAS OVER,1230076800,"12 24, 2008",2008,2497,"['Cashback', 'one', 'weakest', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'acting', 'just', 'fair', 'plot', 'manage', 'move', 'along', 'fact', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'script', 'work', 'cinematography', 'also', 'just', 'average', 'scene', 'when', 'young', 'artist', 'Ben', 'floats', 'payphone', 'bed', 'short', 'light', 'fluffy', 'film', 'nobody', 'should', 'take', 'seriously', 'even', 'like', 'it.The', 'action', 'when', 'rather', 'sensitive', 'young', 'artist', 'Ben', 'Willis', 'Sean', 'Biggerstaff', 'painful', 'breakup', 'girlfriend', 'two', 'years', 'Suzy', 'Michelle', 'Ryan', 'Ben', 'so', 'upset', 'very', 'bad', 'case', 'insomnia', 'unable', 'sleep', 'several', 'weeks', 'Ben', 'eventually', 'job', 'night', 'shift', 'worker', 'local', 'supermarket', 'do', 'something', 'productive', 'night', 'supermarket', 'Ben', 'meets', 'becomes', 'enchanted', 'lovely', 'young', 'checkout', 'girl', 'named', 'Sharon', 'Pintey', 'who', 'actually', 'played', 'rather', 'well', 'Emilia', 'Fox.Nevertheless', 'Ben', 'shy', 'entirely', 'whopping', 'four', 'weeks', 'time', 'dumped', 'Suzy', 'time', 'date', 'Sharon', 'Ben', 'poor', 'guy', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'two', 'steps', 'even', 'put', 'underwear', 'right', 'girlfriend', 'NOW', 'also', 'imagine', 'can', 'stop', 'time', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'move', 'somewhat', 'secretly', 'where', 'will', 'lead', 'Other', 'complications', 'soon', 'develop', 'Ben', 'boss', 'supermarket', 'party', 'course', 'Ben', 'rest', 'night', 'shift', 'staff', 'have', 'attend', 'What', 'will', 'Ben', 'do', 'when', 'party', 'Sharon', 'date', 'only', 'see', 'Suzy', 'now', 'steadily', 'dating', 'boss', 'younger', 'brother', 'How', 'will', 'Sharon', 'react', 'Suzy', 'approaching', 'Ben', 'party', 'How', 'Sharon', 'figure', 'soccer', 'match', 'Ben', 'guys', 'supermarket', 'play', 'opposing', 'team', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', 'like', 'sort', 'stuff', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'short', 'version', 'film', 'actually', 'recommend', 'watch', 'short', 'instead', 'feature', 'length', 'film.Overall', 'Cashback', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'being', 'day', 'late', 'dollar', 'short', 'financial', 'pun', 'intended', 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'however', 'put', 'one', 'list', 'forgettable', 'films', 'try', 'be', 'good', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'it.Two', 'stars', 'one', 'star', 'couple', 'laughs', 'second', 'star', 'good', 'performance', 'Emilia', 'Fox', 'Ben', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Sharon']",Cashback
1072147,A237RLQXTL55RG,B000PKG8TM,off the tropic,"[0, 0]","Sean Ellis's movie ""Cashback"" is a remarkable mood-piece evoking the angst-ridden satire of Office Space with a surreal British touch. Emilia Fox and Sean Biggerstaff head a near perfect cast in this imaginative romantic comedy.Sharon (Emilia Fox) works the night shift in the neighborhood grocery store, apathetic to her work and everyone around her. Ben (Sean Biggerstaff) who has been shown the door by his girlfriend Suzy (Michelle Ryan) and cannot sleep for nights after that soon joins the night shift at the same store. The job is a God-send for Ben. The job does not cure his insomnia but he enjoys the company. He is pushed around a bit, being the new guy, but the team at the store is a congenial and comic bunch.Jenkins (Stuart Goodwin) as a narcissist boss at the store barks out orders every which way. His coffee cup with ""THE BOSS"" written on it further confirms that he loves the power trip and his job. Ben and friends at the store tolerate him. Stuart Goodwin has perfected the art of doing the bumbling buffoonery bit perfectly. A highlight of the sort of comedy that is at display here is his hilarious team building projects. The football match he arranges with a team of professional soccer players is meant to build morale. His rousing speech has a ring of the high seriousness and slapstick humor of Inspector Clousseau. Obviously his exhortations do not cut it as Jenkins and his team get a sound thrashing. Quite literally. They lose 24 to nothing. This rout is crowned with Jenkins sent to the hospital battered, bruised, and with a broken neck. The Boss is released with a neck brace and a head wound. But disgrace and injury do not prevent him from announcing a party. He is thus terrifically funny, unintentionally so, with an endearing quality despite his imperious ways.The surreal beauty of the film is evoked by Ben's special capability. He likes to ""freeze time"" and walk around people frozen in time, like Tussaud Wax figures, carefully studying them. He is a painter, a quiet observer, able to extract beauty from the most prosaic and unlikely of moments. Those freeze frame shots with Ben in contemplation are remarkably expressive and is a reminder that emotional resonance can be derived from that now overused, even clich&eacute;d technique, first made famous in the ""Matrix"" franchise.The director, Sean Ellis has a subtle, meticulous, eye. The compositions of some of the scenes have the extraordinary sensibility of Richard Kelly at his peak in Donnie Darko. But that moodiness and remove from reality, even when this film is at its prosaic best, never gets pretentious. The rhythm and composition has a relaxed elegance about it. Sean Biggerstaff is important here. He is a natural in front of the camera. His Ben has an alert yet quiet remove from the world. A fitting perspective for a painter of much talent. He has an indifference about life until he observes beauty. He cannot help but occasionally steal glances at Sharon. Sharon revives him as surely as Ben brings the zest back to Sharon's life.They reveal their dreams to each other. He wants his paintings to be exhibited at an art gallery, she wants to travel to South America. The highlight of the film is the conversation between Ben and Sharon and their delight in each other's company. Always natural, unaffected, the charm and chemistry between Emilia Fox and Sean Biggerstaff is worth calling out. At the risk of exaggerating my fondness for this scene, their screen chemistry reminds me of the remarkably tender scenes of conversation between Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) and Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint) in On the Waterfront. Sean Ellis has Elia Kazan's way with actors. The acting is superb with that vintage British nuance. Emilia Fox's charm works so well with Sean Biggerstaff's disarming earnestness. She has the intelligent controlled screen presence of her father, Edward Fox, the original Jackal in The Day of the Jackal from the 1970s, and her uncle James Fox, that highly underrated actor of The Chase (1966) and Remains of the Day (1992).Ben agrees to be Sharon's date for the boss's party. It is a perfect night until misunderstandings creep in. This light romantic comedy transforms from this point on to an unexpectedly moving story that is a reminder of those remarkably effective John Cusack movies from the 1980s: The Sure Thing and Say Anything. Sean Ellis's way with music to encapsulate the mood of the film from this point on with a song from an old eighties group Frankie Goes to Hollywood, their perennial hit The Power of Love, transforms the film from satire and comedy to a tastefully conceived melodrama in the tradition of the best films of Cameron Crowe.When things threaten to unravel between Sharon and Ben, Ben opts to freeze time to undo Sharon's perception of what went on in the party, wrong as her impressions of the matter are. Ben walks around Sharon frozen in time, observes her distraught and sad. He unfreezes time, letting Sharon leave, since there is no way he can push back time.The mood of ""Cashback"" only strengthens with scenes of astonishing lyricism, utterly authentic with genuine transcendental moments. When I heard the music in the film's end credits, a song at the end of it seemed to capture the entire mood of the film. An unforgettable mood piece by the Norwegian group, R&ouml;yksopp: What Else is There?, its pulsing, dreamy, rhythms could be director Sean Ellis's cinematic muse. There is a bit of Bjork in the otherworldly voice of (borrowed) lead singer, Karin Dreijer Andersson. Andersson's voice has dreamier turns of pitch and accent to make this track a curious blend of the best of Abba, Pink Floyd and Giorgio Moroder. This song, like the film, weaves a variety of genres into its expressive canvas.R&ouml;yksopp and ""Cashback"" recall inspiring collaborations between director and composers: Vangelis and ""Chariots of Fire"", Pink Floyd and ""Zabriskie Point"", Vangelis and ""Bladerunner"", Tears for Fears and ""Donnie Darko"".",5,Royksopp as Cinematic Muse,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,6004,"['Sean', 'Ellis',

1072148,A1D3XQC2DIT,B000PKG8TM,Peter Shermeta,"[5, 10]","Ben Willis is an Art College student who finds himself with a lot more time on his hands after he and his girlfriend go their separate ways. Not only does he gain the time they would have spent together, but also any time normally allocated to sleep since he is now an insomniac. The end of his relationship with Suzy has left him unable to fall asleep, so at least he tries to be more productive with his nights and gets a job at a local supermarket. Time is Ben's enemy; with each ticking second he has more waking time to think about Suzy. Until he fights back. Ben begins to daydream that he can stop time, everyone and everything stops except him. In his mind he uses this time to draw and paint the people that he sees. In between his daydreaming and the hijinks of other store employees, Ben meets a girl. She works one of the registers, she might be dating one of their coworkers, and she might be the key to Ben getting his happiness (and sleep) back.I really liked the story and the idea behind this movie. I thought it was neat how the pieces fit together, or didn't fit together. It was one of the movies where just about everything comes full circle, which was entertaining.My only gripe, and it is a small one, is that Cashback failed me with its execution. I just feel like the movie could have been better, though I am not sure how. See, not much of a gripe at all. The movie was cute and enjoyable, so check it out...unless of course you might be bothered by a few-minute sequence when every woman is fully or partially naked (all in the name of art!).",3,It was good.

1072150,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B000PKG8TM,Richard Ross,"[8, 12]","Studies have shown that British women have the biggest natural busts out of anyone. Thankfully, 'Cashback' offers plenty of scientific proof to back that claim up. But these copious amounts of full nudity are the only bright spots in this otherwise droll and dreary Brit comedy.After dumping his nagging girlfriend, morose art student Ben (Sean Biggerstaff) develops a bad case of insomnia. Heartbroken and exhausted, Ben stays up for days on end with no relief in sight. After tons and tons of pretentious narration, he decides to do something productive with his extra 8 hours a night and takes a job as a stock-boy at the local grocery store. His quirky co-workers include a pair of horny cashiers (Matt and Barry), a goofy kid obsessed with kung-fu, a delusional boss (Jenkins) and a cute cashier named Sharon (Emilia Fox). It doesn't take long for the monotony to set in, but when it does, Ben discovers a hidden power he never knew he had: the ability to freeze time. Specifically, he can freeze whatever is happening in front of him, position people any way he wants them and basically wander around the still life that surrounds him. Like any aspiring art student, Ben uses his newfound power to undress the most beautiful and buxom female customers and sketch them in all their naked splendor. While undeniably beautiful to look at, these scenes raise a lot of questions and concerns. How lovable of a guy is Ben really if all he's doing is freezing time for the sole purpose of undressing vulnerable and unsuspecting women and then wrapping his crimes in the name of art? Anyway, Ben grows bored with his new hobby and sets his sights on Sharon. Before he can ask her out though he learns that Matt has beat him to it. Is Ben too late or will Sharon realize he's the one for her? Can these two shy and unassuming souls find love in each other's arms? Will Ben's ex show up at the worst possible time to throw a wrench into his blossoming new romance, forcing Ben to chase after Sharon and explain himself?Those aren't spoilers by the way. If you've seen a romantic comedy, you know these are standard hurdles for the protagonists to jump over. This is my biggest problem with the movie: it uses gimmicks like freezing time and plenty of naked flesh to try to disguise the fact that, at its core, it's just your standard rom-com with a sullen boy trying to win the affections of a doesn't-know-she's beautiful free spirit while all around them quirky characters constantly threaten to ruin everything they've worked for. There's the possibility for a very interesting subplot after Ben discovers another person who has the ability to freeze time but the filmmakers never explore that route. It would have been a lot more interesting to find out who this person was than to watch an extended soccer match or a wild party at Jenkins' house featuring a barely legal stripper. Not to mention the fact that the film is pretentious as hell. Ben's dialogue is so smug and precious trying to pass for deep.

It makes this sound like some sort of sexist science-fiction softcore; the movie, thankfully, has far more in common with Office Space than it does with some sort of interplanetary version of Gor.Plot: Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff from the Harry Potter franchise) has just been dumped by his longtime, and first, girlfriend Suzy (EastEnders' Michelle Ryan). Seemingly unable to create and having developed a severe case of insomnia, Ben takes a job working graveyard shift at a local supermarket. Eventually, he discovers another talent (or is it all in his head?): he finds himself capable of stopping time, wandering through the frozen landscapes to find inspiration for his artwork. (This is where the description comes in--he stops time during a shift and wanders through the aisles, undressing customers and co-workers alike and sketching them.) But all that, while advancing the plot in a couple of key scenes, takes a back seat to the inherent craziness of graveyard shift at a grocery store, as well as a budding romance with co-worker Sharon (The Pianist's Emilia Fox) that lands Ben in a bind when he runs into Suzy at a party.It's fun stuff, with a ridiculous but all-too-believable cast of co-workers to provide hilarity, a solid romance angle, and a crew who knows what they're doing, headed up by director Sean Ellis (who would return two years later with the above-average The Broken).

1072153,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000PKG8TM,Roland E. Zwick,"[18, 31]","**1/2The small British film ""Cashback"" is a sporadically engaging, but ultimately unsatisfying rumination on art, love and the relative nature of time.The idea for the movie is, in many respects, better than the movie itself.  Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff) is an art student whose girlfriend has just broken up with him after years together as a couple.  Ben is so emotionally devastated by the rejection that he becomes virtually a dead man walking, an incurable insomniac who goes literally whole nights without sleeping.  To assuage his pain and to make the time pass more quickly, he takes a job working the late night shift at a local supermarket.  While there, he develops the sudden ability to make time ""freeze"" at will, kind of like in that old ""Twilight Zone"" episode, ""A Kind of a Stopwatch,"" or the movie ""Clockstoppers"" (though Ben doesn't need anything as mundane as a magical time piece to accomplish the feat).  Most of the movie is spent chronicling Ben's interactions with his amusingly eccentric co-workers as well as with the beautiful young cashier named Sharon (Emilia Fox) with whom he falls in love.For all its undeniable cleverness and charm, ""Cashback"" never really finds a way to turn its fantastical premise into anything other than an overused gimmick.  Indeed, it's hard to tell what exactly Ben thinks he's accomplishing when he pauses everyone in mid action.  It doesn't even make much sense within the context of the movie's own storyline, since stopping everything dead in its tracks is certainly no way to make time go FASTER, which is what Ben, in voiceover recitation, keeps telling us he wants to do.The movie is actually at its most enjoyable and authentic when it drops all the silly time-stopping shenanigans and pretentious philosophizing and simply shows us the day-to-day activities of Ben and his fellow employees at the market.  One of the themes of the movie is that time moves more slowly when we are trapped in tedious jobs and activities, yet, ironically, it is those very on-the-job activities that are of most interest here.  Much of the credit for that goes to the delightful performances of Stuart Goodwin, Michael Dixon and Michael Lambourne as Ben's loopy male co-workers.  They are certainly more interesting as people than Sharon and even Ben himself are.Sean Ellis has written and directed the movie with a great deal of elegance and style, utilizing sophisticated ""freezing"" techniques, a smoothly-gliding dolly camera, and a classical music score to great effect.  The pacing is often tedious, however, and we sometimes feel less like a witness to Ben's bizarre time-stopping ability than a victim of it.  There were certainly times when I wished I had the power to make this movie go faster.Part of the problem may be that the material was originally made into a short in 2004, then expanded into this feature length film in 2006.  That may explain the feeling we get that the movie is stretching itself further than perhaps it is able to go.  Still, there's much that is good in even this elongated ""Cashback,"" although it certainly leaves one wondering whether the shorter version might not in fact be the better way to go.",2,the secondary characters are more interesting than the principals,1189296000,"09 9, 2007",2007,3187,"['**1/2The', 'small', 'British', 'film', 'Cashback', 'sporadically', 'engaging', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying', 'rumination', 'art', 'love', 'relative', 'nature', 'time.The', 'idea', 'movie', 'many', 'respects', 'better', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Willis', 'Sean', 'Biggerstaff', 'art', 'student', 'girlfriend', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'years', 'together', 'couple', 'Ben', 'so', 'emotionally', 'devastated', 'rejection', 'virtually', 'dead', 'man', 'walking', 'incurable', 'insomniac', 'who', 'literally', 'whole', 'nights', 'sleeping', 'assuage', 'pain', 'make', 'time', 'pass', 'more', 'quickly', 'job', 'working', 'late', 'night', 'shift', 'local', 'supermarket', 'there', 'sudden', 'ability', 'make', 'time', 'freeze', 'will', 'kind', 'like', 'old', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'Kind', 'Stopwatch', 'movie', 'Clockstoppers', 'Ben', ""n't"", 'need', 'anything', 'as', 'mundane', 'magical', 'time', 'piece', 'accomplish', 'feat', 'Most', 'movie', 'spent', 'chronicling', 'Ben', 'interactions', 'amusingly', 'eccentric', 'co-workers', 'as', 'well', 'beautiful', 'young', 'cashier', 'named', 'Sharon', 'Emilia', 'Fox', 'whom', 'love.For', 'undeniable', 'cleverness', 'charm', 'Cashback', 'never', 'really', 'way', 'turn', 'fantastical', 'premise', 'anything', 'other', 'overused', 'gimmick', 'Indeed', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'exactly', 'Ben', 'accomplishing', 'when', 'everyone', 'mid', 'action', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'context', 'movie', 'own', 'storyline', 'stopping', 'everything', 'dead', 'tracks', 'certainly', 'way', 'make', 'time', 'go', 'FASTER', 'what', 'Ben', 'voiceover', 'recitation', 'telling', 'do.The', 'movie', 'actually', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'authentic', 'when', 'silly', 'time-stopping', 'shenanigans', 'pretentious', 'philosophizing', 'simply', 'day-to-day', 'activities', 'Ben', 'fellow', 'employees', 'market', 'One', 'themes', 'movie', 'time', 'moves', 'more', 'slowly', 'when', 'are', 'trapped', 'tedious', 'jobs', 'activities', 'yet', 'ironically', 'very', 'on-the-job', 'activities', 'are', 'most', 'interest', 'here', 'Much', 'credit', 'delightful', 'performances', 'Stuart', 'Goodwin', 'Michael', 'Dixon', 'Michael', 'Lambourne', 'Ben', 'loopy', 'male', 'co-workers', 'are', 'certainly', 'more', 'interesting', 'people', 'Sharon', 'even', 'Ben', 'are.Sean', 'Ellis', 'written', 'directed', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'elegance', 'style', 'utilizing', 'sophisticated', 'freezing', 'techniques', 'smoothly-gliding', 'dolly', 'camera', 'classical', 'music', 'score', 'great', 'effect', 'pacing', 'often', 'tedious', 'however', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'less', 'witness', 'Ben', 'bizarre', 'time-stopping', 'ability', 'victim', 'were', 'certainly', 'times', 'when', 'wished', 'had', 'power', 'make', 'movie', 'go', 'faster.Part', 'problem', 'may', 'be', 'material', 'was', 'originally', 'made', 'short', '2004', 'then', 'expanded', 'feature', 'length', 'film', '2006', 'may', 'explain', 'feeling', 'get', 'movie', 'stretching', 'further', 'perhaps', 'able', 'go', 'Still', 'much', 'good', 'even', 'elongated', 'Cashback', 'certainly', 'one', 'wondering', 'shorter', 'version', 'might', 'not', 'fact', 'be', 'better', 'way', 'go']",Cashback

I have to say that while I did not come back to the US with an accent (darn it), I did come back with an appreciation for some British movie sensibilities.This movie is not the exploration of titillation that many may assume from its cover art or from the movies it gets grouped with (Notice what movie comes teamed up with this one in Amazon as the ""buy this one too and get X discount""). The movie description gives you the main assumption. A man hits emotional bottom and finds an ability to freeze time.It's about where you end up when you feel you have screwed up in a relationship. It's about how you beat yourself up and wish you could undo what you have done. It is also about realizing that sometimes, those things you prayed to change were in fact the best things in your life.We explore these topics through the eyes of a young man with a unique appreciation of beauty. Being a young Man, that appreciation gets its focus from the female form. It allows us to see the perception of beauty through his eyes. None of us will miss the in your face beauty that gets paraded before us. But will all of us notice the unique play on beauty when it's in a rage and how ugly that can be? Or will we notice that at least one person seems to blossom into their beauty as the movie progresses?There is more than what you see on the surface of this film. It will likely leave you as happy as ""Love Actually"" did when it ended.  Plus, it will give those that don't want to spend too much time thinking about hidden meanings plenty of shots of naughty bits.... very beautiful ones at that.But make sure and understand me here, the nudity that is presented does not feel ""personal"" or vulgar. It has the feeling of distance that you would get from viewing fine nude artwork at a museum. The language gets a bit rough at time, but not horribly so. So, while its definitely not for the kiddies, it does not even approach the types of concerns many parents of teenagers might have about the usual movie with nudity.I suggest taking a chance on this one.

1072159,A1WHAJUBDQFM3Y,B000PKG8TM,Skippy McGee,"[16, 27]","I will start out with something positive: This was a very pretty film. Other than that, it has nothing to offer. The first mistake would be the idea that the self absorbed art student full of ennui makes a sensitive and deep protagonist. I find the fact that he believes that, as an artist, he ""explores"" the idea of beauty to be both hilarious and offensive when really all he does is look at T&A; (that all conform to very standard ideals of beauty) for an hour and a half. His narration is at times painfully dull and and at others laughably bad in its attempt to be profound. It is just generally lazy writing: anyone who has gone past writing 101 will tell you that showing is always better than telling, and a movie full of exposition leads the viewer to feel no connection with any of the characters. There were also attempts at ""humor"" that were so badly paced and cliche that they are barely worth mentioning. I also was questioning whether or not his ""power"" to stop time was real throughout, and in the end it seems that it may have been. If it was, then the fact that he is literally going around and undressing women without their consent takes his character from harmless self indulgent angst to someone who commits sexual assault. Seeing as the women in this film are already merely props and catalysts for this character, I would not say I'm surprised, but I do find it morally repugnant.  I mean, honestly, this is a movie that describes love as ""wrapped in beauty and hidden away between the seconds of your life.""  That sounds like something Michael Scott would write.

""Cashback"" is a standout film, one of those original and striking creations that blow you away once every few years like ""Trainspotting"" did, or ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Snatch.""  At once slapstick and quite amusing, ""Cashback"" is a startling meditation on the beauty of the female form introduced through frozen time, wherein the lead character is able to wander amidst the rest of us, stuck in our places, while he variously undresses, poses, and sketches us unaware.  Much of the movie is voiced over, an internal monologue that never tires its audience or slows the film.  The special effects last throughout the movie, fisheye lenses, time standing still, and a positively beautiful ending amidst a time-frozen snowstorm that the two lovers wander through, the individually discernable snowflakes parting in their wake to leave human outlines hanging in the air.  The soundtrack alternates between Ravel's ""Bolero""  and pumped-up house, the  plot taking on similar extremes of comedy, beauty, and profundity.  ""Cashback"" is like an old sweater that you just slide into on a rainy Sunday afternoon, everything is so comfortable and familiar as you microwave your organic popcorn, but at the same time the perspective is startling and original, the world is slightly askew, and you have stumbled upon a movie like ""The Time of the Gypsies,"" or ""Office Space"" meets ""The Matrix,"" if you want a comparison more widely known.  ""Cashback"" is funny, sexy, and wildly original, it moves, sings and transports, there is a hint of mystery; and in the end it is a simple girl-breaks-up-with-boy, boy-meets-new-girl story: but no one has told it like this before.",5,"Hilarious, Sexy, Deep",1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,1781,"['When', 'DVD', 'cover', 'half', 'nude', 'young', 'woman', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'find', 'profound', 'deeply', 'affecting', 'movie', 'underneath', 'Cashback', 'standout', 'film', 'one', 'original', 'striking', 'creations', 'blow', 'away', 'once', 'few', 'years', 'Trainspotting', 'did', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Snatch', 'once', 'slapstick', 'quite', 'amusing', 'Cashback', 'startling', 'meditation', 'beauty', 'female', 'form', 'introduced', 'frozen', 'time', 'wherein', 'lead', 'character', 'able', 'wander', 'rest', 'stuck', 'places', 'variously', 'poses', 'sketches', 'unaware', 'Much', 'movie', 'voiced', 'internal', 'monologue', 'never', 'audience', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'last', 'movie', 'fisheye', 'lenses', 'time', 'standing', 'still', 'positively', 'beautiful', 'ending', 'amidst', 'time-frozen', 'snowstorm', 'two', 'lovers', 'wander', 'individually', 'discernable', 'snowflakes', 'parting', 'wake', 'leave', 'human', 'outlines', 'hanging', 'air', 'soundtrack', 'Ravel', 'Bolero', 'pumped-up', 'house', 'plot', 'taking', 'similar', 'extremes', 'comedy', 'beauty', 'profundity', 'Cashback', 'old', 'sweater', 'just', 'slide', 'rainy', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'everything', 'so', 'comfortable', 'familiar', 'microwave', 'organic', 'popcorn', 'same', 'time', 'perspective', 'startling', 'original', 'world', 'slightly', 'askew', 'have', 'stumbled', 'movie', 'Time', 'Gypsies', 'Office', 'Space', 'meets', 'Matrix', 'want', 'comparison', 'more', 'widely', 'known', 'Cashback', 'funny', 'sexy', 'wildly', 'original', 'sings', 'transports', 'hint', 'mystery', 'end', 'simple', 'girl-breaks-up-with-boy', 'boy-meets-new-girl', 'story', 'one', 'told', 'before']",Cashback

If a couple shots of the female form is going to get your panties in a bunch then don't sit down to watch this film, please. Though cover art can be deceiving one should assume that the image of a possibly semi-naked girl might imply some nudity.With that being said, 2006's Cashback is a story about newly single Ben Willis(Sean Biggerstaff, of Harry Potter fame) an art student who's break-up has given him an unshakable case of insomnia.Ben realizes his inability to sleep might be fruitful if he gets a job, therefore he becomes employed at a local grocery store as a night janitor. With a crazy bunch of co-workers and his own special way of stopping time help to maintain any sense of his sanity against the long, tedious shifts and abrasive customers. Ben feels like he's barely getting by when he meets Sharon(Emilia Fox) a quiet checkout girl who works at the market, and who just might be the perfect distraction.Cashback portrays an artists mind perfectly and beautifully as we examine Ben's ability to 'stop time' and admire every bit of beauty  around him, even in the hell hole he seems to be stuck in he can find beauty.""I read once about a woman whose secret fantasy was to have an affair with an artist. She thought he would really see her.

Growing up as a boy in England: that doesn't ever endear itself to the viewer at all and only serves to make the film longer and not any more interesting.4.

It succeeds on all levels: masterful camera work, perfect casting, splendid dialog, characters with whom you can really connect, and a clever, original plot.Most of us can personally relate to virtually every situation, emotion, and comment made by the lead character. Rarely does a movie so accurately portray so many almost inexplicable emotions such as longing, loneliness, and utter boredom.The characters are stuck in the most boring possible workplace and each seek their own ways to preserve their sanity. One idiotic pair play childish pranks, while the female lead, beautifully played by Emilia Fox, covers her watch with tape and avoids looking at the clock at all costs....for as we all know, a watched clock moves even more slowly.The male lead, played by Sean Biggerstaff, however, embraces the slowness of time's passage, and appears to be able to make time actually stand still. During these periods, when everyone else is frozen in place, he roams about undressing and drawing some of the store's more beautiful clientele. As other reviewers have noted, this could have descended into gross pornography, but, as a testiment to the great skill of the author and director, Ellis, it actually rises to the level of art.The dual love story is also quite moving: the painful destruction of one relationship and the gradual development of a new one. At all times, both are absolutely plausible and emotionally tone perfect.In conclusion, there is a much better reason to buy, rent, or borrow this DVD than its cover photo: the simple fact that I and many other reviewers have given it our highest recommendation. So many people just can't be wrong. Please trust us and view this splendid film at your earliest convenience.

1072169,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000PKG8TM,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[84, 100]","In 2006, the short film Cashback was nominated for a best live-action short Oscar. Writer/Director Sean Ellis then went on to spin the short about a night-shift worker in a supermarket into a feature about a night-shift worker in a supermarket. Using the same actors, and even most of the footage from the original short, Ellis adds a painful breakup to our hero's life, which brings on a case of incurable insomnia. Looking for a way to cash in on his inability to sleep, art student Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff) applies for a job at an all-night supermarket.Anyone remember Saved By the Bell and Zack Morris's envy-worthy ability to utter the phrase ""time-out"" and thus freeze time? In Cashback Ben has this same ability, but he uses it in a much more libidinous way: to undress attractive women in the grocery store he works at and then draw their nude figures. Granted, these gratuitous scenes are not the crux of the film, but they're likely to be the most memorable to most viewers. As the camera slowly pans over (and back over) the striking nude female forms, the audience is to see Ben as an intrepid young artist, not as a peeping Tom. The artistic presentation of the women, and the flashbacks to Ben's childhood experiences do their best to give this impression, but the extended length of the scenes and their lack of importance to the final outcome of the story, implies a hint of exploitation rather than simple artistic expression. For the most extensive look at the indelible female form since Striptease, Cashback has cornered the market. Cleverly disguised in the form of a romantic comedy, Cashback manages to comes across as an artsy British Garden State meets Showgirls.With an endearing cast of characters, including Emilia Fox as Ben's new love interest at the supermarket, Cashback offers an intriguing story exploring the complicated topics of relationships and self-expression through surrealistic methods, including freezing and fast-forwarding time. At different points, the world is swirling around Ben, faster than he can keep up, while at others everything stops and he can examine the world between the moments that we live. Eventually he comes to realize that there are times when fast-forward and freeze frame are on equal footing; no matter what, the past can't be undone.Cashback is the first feature from director Sean Ellis, and while it's clear that he has enormous talent in the fields of both writing and directing, it's also clear that he has much room to grow as an artist. At times the film begins to meander a bit, and points that seem to have real significance to the story are left by the wayside as new plotlines are picked up. This causes the film to play out almost episodically, like several short films strapped together. This is only fitting, considering that Cashback started as a short.
