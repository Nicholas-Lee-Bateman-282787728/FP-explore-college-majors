The pseudo-documentary approach, while not original in such matters, is done with expertise.

The incident itself was a tragedy, but certainly not one that besmirches the Marine Corps nor one that should just be ignored as another incident of war. But it is a reality of Iraq, like it or not.Not being a former Marine (I was in the Navy), I won't take up the discussion about how real they are in the film.

The film documents a real incident where many innocent lives were taken in apparent reprisal for the roadside bombing death/injury of several soldiers. The civilians, insurgents and marines are all given fair screentime to explain their actions and are presented in a very down to earth and realistic manner. I don't believe i have ever seen a war film take such an impartial stance before which is where the real power of this story lies. Because sides aren't taken we can make up our own minds as to the guilt of the characters involved. The real perpetrator however is war itself where motives and human nature become darkened to such a degree that this type of thing occurs. This film really highlights how different cultures and attitudes towards life and war itself clash and can cause such despair for the people caught up amongst it.Note: Real Ex Marines portray the american characters here and give some very interesting insights into how they approached the storyline and acting process in a behind the scenes feature also contained on the disc.

1192172,AY8WZDYR79GFV,B001FRNB9Y,Yasha Banana,"[4, 13]","Director Nick Broomfield cast 12 former Marines in ""The Battle for Haditha.""  One of them, Elliot Ruiz, plays the lead-role of ""Corporal Ramirez"" and is interviewed in one of the DVD extras.Elliot Ruiz, we learn, is a combat veteran who was seriously injured in Iraq.  He was also traumatized psychologically.  Given the things he had seen and done, he began to have nightmares.  He couldn't sleep and he couldn't eat.He needed medical help.However, when he went to his commander -- in the movie as well as in real life -- and asked to see a doctor, he was told that it's not Marine Corps policy to provide a marine with psychological counseling while in Iraq.  He had to wait until his tour of duty was up.Elliot Ruiz is bitter about this.  He's also bitter because he feels the Marine Corps did not adequately cover the medical expenses that resulted from his injuries in Iraq.So here's a man, Elliot Ruiz, a former marine, not an actor, who suffered severe physical and emotional injuries who, in the movie as well as in real life, says, point-blank, that the Marine Corps ""just doesn't care.""And yet, ironically, in his DVD interview he says that one thing he didn't want to do in the movie was to ""make the Marine Corps look bad."" ... Such is the extent of the ""loyalty"" instilled by the Marine Corps in its soldiers.It's clear from the DVD extras that former marines were cast so that the movie would be accurate in terms of how things are done in Iraq.  For example, in one of the DVD extra, we see Elliot Ruiz brief the film crew on just how Iraqi civilians are stopped and searched at a US checkpoint.We are also told by Nick Broomfield in the ""Director's Commentary"" that the marines lived together during the filming of the movie in specially-built barracks -- the same type of barracks they occupied in Iraq -- so that a great deal of the dialogue, camaraderie and horsing around is not staged but rather spontaneous, organic and unscripted.  Broomfield simply turned on his cameras and filmed it.It should be noted that the title of this movie, ""The Battle For Haditha,"" is a misnomer.  It's not about a battle, it's about a massacre.  The movie reconstructs the events that led to the massacre of 24 defenseless men, women and children by US marines in Haditha in November 2005.How did this massacre of 24 defenseless civilians take place?  What caused this atrocity to happen?  Was it simply a case of the marines losing control, ""going over the line""?  No. ...What happened in Haditha happened because of US military policies that have been in place for a long time.  In the movie -- which included not only former marines with no acting experience but also several Iraqi civilians with no acting experience -- in the movie we see the training, the belief-system, the ""indoctrination process,"" if you will, that caused the marines to carry out their murderous assault.We hear the marines chant: ""TRAIN, TRAIN, TRAIN, TO KILL, KILL, KILL!""We are told by the marines themselves that they are taught to be ""like a machine"" and that because they are in a hostile environment, they need to be not only super-aggressive but suspicious of everyone -- men, women and children.This is how US military are trained in Iraq and this is how US military were trained in Vietnam.  This is what is expected of marines by their superiors.This is how a neo-colonial occupying force is trained, whether it's the US in Iraq and Vietnam, the French in Algiers, or the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.  ""The Battle For Haditha"" tells us, up-close and personal, what it's like to be a soldier fighting to expand an empire; that is to say, what's it's like to be a soldier trained to kill to make *others* rich.Those others -- the soldiers' superiors: the majors, colonels and generals, as well as the economic/political elite at home -- those others make sure the soldiers are trained to be effective killers, but when they are maimed or injured, as Elliot Ruiz attests to -- tough luck!  The higher-ups ""just don't care.""That's when the troops stop becoming ""our boys.""When they need health care or help finding a job, then the political oligarchy that sent them into battle conveniently forgets who they are.But this movie doesn't let us forget.  ""The Battle For Haditha"" is a vivid, disturbing, upsetting reminder of how the higher-ups orchestrate -- through their orders, their policies and their ""rules of engagement"" -- the killing of human beings, innocent as well as trained.Interviewed after the movie, Ruiz said: ""It's crazy, people don't know the type of things that we go through.  That's what I like about the film, it shows that.""In the movie, a marine is killed by an I.E.D. (an improvised explosive device), after which we hear a commander back at headquarters radio to the troops in the field: ""Take whatever action is necessary.  I don't want any more marines killed.""Corporeal Ramirez (Elliot Ruiz) and his men pull four innocent Iraqis out of a stopped taxicab, question them about the I.E.D. and, frustrated, summarily execute them.Then, searching for the insurgents who planted the bomb, the marines, now in a frenzy of rage, storm a nearby house, breaking down doors and indiscriminately killing everyone in sight, including small children.After the initial cold-blooded killings occur, a marine sniper picks off an Iraq man running from the scene -- a man whose only crime is living in a house near the I.E.D. attack.Fellow marines then gather around the sniper, laughing and joking, cheerfully congratulating him on his marksmanship.After the massacre is over, the marines huddle up and a prayer is offered.Corporeal Ramirez is then told by his superior that he will be promoted to sergeant and that he will be recommended for a medal.However, Ramirez is sickened by what has happened and by his role in the massacre.  He goes over to the side of the road and throws up; returning to the snickers of his fellow marines.Clearly, as per the marine code, killing is to be done without remorse.In a prologue, Ramirez is arrested and along with four other Marines is charged with murder.  One of officers presiding over the trail being the officer whose orders triggered the massacre!Director Nick Broomfield did an enormous amount of research to make sure he accurately depicted the Haditha events.  He not only cast twelve former marines in key roles, he also spoke at great length to some of the marines actually involved in the Haditha incident.  Moreover, he met with Iraqi insurgents who claimed to be active in Haditha.The marines who were present at Haditha explained to Broomfield the ""standard operating procedures"" under which they were acting.  In an interview for ""Time Out,"" Broomfield explains: ""If, for example, a house is described as `hostile,' then you just kill everyone in the house.  It doesn't matter if it contains two-year-olds or the elderly, which is what they did in Fallujah -- where these guys had come from. ...""It was hard to condemn them out of hand as cold-blooded killers. ... The US government and the Marine Corps (made) scapegoats of these guys, (rather) than actually deal with its policy and rules of engagement in Iraq.  I'm sure it happens on a lesser scale every single day.""Finally, consider the consequences of the US interventions in Iraq over the past 20 years.1.) Gulf War One.Robert Fisk in his book, ""The Great War for Civilization,"" estimates the number of Iraqi fatalities in Gulf War One at between 20,000 to 35,000.Others put the death-count significantly higher.  For example, a February 6, 2003 Business Week article entitled ""Toting the Casualties of War,"" reported that in 1992 Beth Osborne Daponte, a demographer in the Commerce Department, publicly contradicted then-Defense Secretary Richard Cheney as to how many Iraqis died in Gulf War One.Daponte's report for the US Commerce Department's Census Bureau of Foreign Countries estimated 86,194 men, 39,612 women, and 32,195 children killed by Allied Forces.  A total of roughly 158,000 Iraqi deaths.NOTE: By contrast, Gulf War One resulted in the death of only 379 Coalition troops; 189 of whom were killed as a result of either friendly fire or accidents.2.) The Economic Sanctions Against IraqThe US- and UK-led economic sanctions against Iraq lasted from 1990 to 2003.  Some estimate that by 2003 over one million Iraqis died as a direct result of those economic sanctions.Denis Halliday, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq from 1997 to 1998, resigned his position in protest, characterizing the economic sanctions against Iraq as ""genocide.""As for the US government's response to the sanctions, on May 12, 1996, President Bill Clinton's Secretary of State Madeline Albright was interviewed on ""60 Minutes"" by Leslie Stahl.  Here is an exchange that took place during that interview:LESLEY STAHL (on economic sanctions against Iraq): We have heard (via a UN report) that a half million children have died.  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.  And, you know, is the price worth it?SECRETARY OF STATE MADELINE ALBRIGHT: I think it's a very hard choice, but the price, we think it's worth it.The UN report Leslie Stahl was referring to was the 1995 UN Food and Agriculture Organization Report which stated that ""more than one million Iraqis have died -- 567,000 of them children -- as a direct result of the economic sanctions.""That was as of 1995.  The sanctions last until 2003 -- with some putting the total number of Iraqi dead at over 1.5 million.So that all those deaths were, according to a sitting US Secretary of State, Madeline Albright, ""worth it.""3.) Gulf War Two.In October 2006, John Hopkins conducted a survey in which they estimated that 655,000 ""excess deaths"" occurred in Iraq as a direct result of the March 2003 invasion of that country.Of these 655,000 ""excess deaths,"" 601,000 resulted from violence and the rest from disease and other causes - with 41% of the violent deaths being of males either under 15- years-old or else over 44-years-old.Both the Bush administration and the Blair administration dismissed the John Hopkins survey on Iraqi deaths; however, they *praised* a 2000 John Hopkins survey that estimated 1.7 million deaths in the Congo - citing that survey as the basis for UN security in that country.NOTE: John Hopkins used the same rigorous, scientifically-validated research methodology in the Iraq survey as they did in the Congo survey.-- In August and September of 2007, ORB (Opinion Research Business), one of Britain's leading polling groups, conducted a survey in which they estimated that 1,033,000 Iraqis since Iraq was invaded in March of 2003.Like the 2006 John Hopkins survey, the 2007 ORB survey was only marginally reported by mainstream US and British media.  The story was quickly dropped, quickly forgotten.What has, instead, been widely and repeatedly reported by mainstream US media is the number of *American* casualties that have occurred as a result of Gulf War Two-- that number as of January 17, 2010 standing at 4,373.In short: it took guts to make ""The Battle For Haditha.""  It's a remarkable film.Indeed, the day will come when questions will be asked -- ""Why wasn't more said about what the West has done to Iraq?"" ... ""Why wasn't more reported?"" ...  ""Where was the artistic community?  Why didn't they speak up?  Why were there so few movies about what happened?""Needless to say, the answers to those questions are shameful.Key to the prosecution of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is the government's systematic attempt -- indeed it's *success* -- in hiding the horrors of those wars from the American public.  The criminality of what the US government is doing in the Middle East should horrify every American citizen.As the playwright Arthur Miller put it:""Few of us can easily surrender our belief that society must somehow make sense.  The thought that the State has lost its mind and is punishing so many innocent people is intolerable.  And so the evidence has to be internally denied.""As such, many people will be greatly disturbed by ""The Battle for Haditha.""  But to quote Pete Seeger's song ""God Bless the Grass"" --""God bless the grass that grows thru the crack.They roll the concrete over it to try and keep it back.""The concrete gets tired of what it has to do,It breaks and it buckles and the grass grows thru,And God bless the grass.""God bless the truth that fights toward the sun,They roll the lies over it and think that it is done.""It moves through the ground and reaches for the air,And after a while it's growing everywhere,And God bless the grass.""",5,"""God Bless the Truth That Fights Toward the Sun""",1266192000,"02 15,
