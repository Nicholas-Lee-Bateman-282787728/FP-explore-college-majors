182396,A2GOAEF0ZRNG13,1559409037,Aaron,"[20, 23]","Scorsese's &quot;Last Temptation&quot; is a great and challenging film.  This is NOT some salacious, blasphemous movie!  Quite the opposite, this is  a serious, very spiritial examination of the great sacrifice that Jesus  made. In fact, if detractors of this film(most of whom have never even seen  this or are seriously misinformed)would take a look they would see a highly  original, reverent film that presents a very personal view of Jesus and the  sacrifice he made for us.  Martin Scorsese is probably our finest  filmmaker.  His very best work has always tackled &quot;Catholic&quot;  themes.  Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull are all brilliant  examinations of sin, guilt, and redemption.  So it's no wonder Scorsese  chose to adapt Kazantakis' book.  Last Temptation ranks as one of his VERY  best films, right up there with the aforemntioned films if not of a piece  with them.  This is one of Scorese's most personal films (then again, all  his films are, Scorese being the most personal of American fimmakers). We  are taught that Jesus was the Son of God and the Son of man.  If he is  both, then Jesus was subject to the same pain, guilt, and temptations that  we all have.  Scorese presents most of the major events of Jesus' life: the  Sermon on the Mount(a GREAT scene), the passion in the desert, the Last  Supper, ect.  Through this all Jesus continually questions why he must  suffer, why must he be the One with this &quot;burden&quot;.  Willem Dafoe  is incredible in this most difficult role.  The final 40 minutes of this  film are absolutely powerful when Jesus is on the cross and in absolute  agony he is presented with one final temptation.  This is the scene that  most people question or are offended by.  The scene is fascinating, not  offensive, and presented by Scorsese in a very careful and tasteful  fashion.  I dont want to reveal what occurs, that's for you to discover.  Let's just say, that Jesus rejects this temptation presented to him and  resumes his place on the Cross and fulfills his destiny.  The way Scorsese  presents the events in the film, makes this final scene all the more  powerful.  Scorsese really shows us the sacrifice Jesus made for us, he  shows us what Jesus gave up for us and how much he really loved us to do  this for us. This doesnt sound blasphemous to me at all.  Ironically, this  is probably the most &quot;devout&quot; religious film Ive ever scene.  Technically, the film is brillant.  Scorsese really does'nt know how to  make a boring shot.  The camera work is incredible! Peter Gabriel's music  is astonishing, the acting is GREAT (esp. Dafoe, Hershey, and yes Keitel's  rather eccentric performance) This is a great film, please give it a  chance.",5,"A Challenging, Intense and Wholly Spiritial Masterpiece!",966729600,"08 20, 2000",2000,2732,"['Scorsese', 'quot', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'quot', 'great', 'challenging', 'film', 'NOT', 'salacious', 'blasphemous', 'movie', 'opposite', 'serious', 'very', 'spiritial', 'examination', 'great', 'sacrifice', 'Jesus', 'made', 'fact', 'detractors', 'film', 'most', 'whom', 'have', 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'are', 'seriously', 'misinformed', 'would', 'take', 'look', 'would', 'see', 'highly', 'original', 'reverent', 'film', 'very', 'personal', 'view', 'Jesus', 'sacrifice', 'made', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'probably', 'finest', 'filmmaker', 'very', 'best', 'work', 'always', 'tackled', 'quot', 'Catholic', 'quot', 'themes', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'are', 'brilliant', 'examinations', 'sin', 'guilt', 'redemption', 'wonder', 'Scorsese', 'chose', 'adapt', 'Kazantakis', 'book', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'ranks', 'one', 'VERY', 'best', 'films', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'aforemntioned', 'films', 'not', 'piece', 'one', 'Scorese', 'most', 'personal', 'films', 'then', 'again', 'films', 'are', 'Scorese', 'being', 'most', 'personal', 'American', 'fimmakers', 'are', 'taught', 'Jesus', 'was', 'Son', 'God', 'Son', 'man', 'then', 'Jesus', 'was', 'subject', 'same', 'pain', 'guilt', 'temptations', 'have', 'Scorese', 'presents', 'most', 'major', 'events', 'Jesus', 'life', 'Sermon', 'Mount', 'GREAT', 'scene', 'passion', 'desert', 'Last', 'Supper', 'ect', 'Jesus', 'continually', 'questions', 'why', 'must', 'suffer', 'why', 'must', 'be', 'One', 'quot', 'quot', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'incredible', 'most', 'difficult', 'role', 'final', '40', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'absolutely', 'powerful', 'when', 'Jesus', 'cross', 'absolute', 'agony', 'presented', 'one', 'final', 'temptation', 'scene', 'most', 'people', 'question', 'are', 'offended', 'scene', 'fascinating', 'not', 'offensive', 'presented', 'Scorsese', 'very', 'careful', 'tasteful', 'fashion', 'dont', 'want', 'reveal', 'what', 'discover', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Jesus', 'temptation', 'presented', 'resumes', 'place', 'Cross', 'destiny', 'way', 'Scorsese', 'events', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'more', 'powerful', 'Scorsese', 'really', 'sacrifice', 'Jesus', 'made', 'what', 'Jesus', 'gave', 'up', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'loved', 'do', 'doesnt', 'sound', 'blasphemous', 'Ironically', 'probably', 'most', 'quot', 'devout', 'quot', 'religious', 'film', 'Ive', 'ever', 'scene', 'Technically', 'film', 'brillant', 'Scorsese', 'really', ""does'nt"", 'know', 'how', 'make', 'boring', 'shot', 'camera', 'work', 'incredible', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'music', 'astonishing', 'acting', 'GREAT', 'esp', 'Dafoe', 'Hershey', 'yes', 'Keitel', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'performance', 'great', 'film', 'please', 'give', 'chance']",N/A

The end of the movie had an unbelievable  impact on me. Before the crucifixtion Christ searches for another way, and  although he doesn't wish to be crucified he submits, but not with his  heart. Through a delusion of the Devil he learns that this is the greatest  act on Earth that he can undergo and that  it is the will of God. In the  end Christ truely wishes, with all his heart, to submit to his fate, to his  spiritual purpose on Earth. I don't take the crucifixtion literally,  however in order to live a spiritual life it is necessary to give up  certain personal pleasures or endure difficulties.

182398,AIR4YWDDONXUX,1559409037,Adam M. Miles,"[65, 89]","Anyone of open mind should see this amazing film.  Neither Scorsese's film nor Kazantzakis's novel claim to be &quot;new gospels&quot;, and perhaps  that is a shame, for I'd rather believe in a Christ who overcame internal  conflict and torture, a man who realized his oneness with God rather than  God taking the form of Man. Forget what the fundamentalists say--they  haven't seen this movie and never will.  There is absolutely nothing  exploitive about this movie.  It is instead one of the most tasteful,  intelligent, and loving interpretations of the life of Jesus ever captured.  The acting is terrific, especially Dafoe, who I never imagined could give  such a delicate yet powerful performance. Hershey also gives a career  performance as Magdalene, but the film really belongs to Harvey Keitel  (Judas), who gives a performance worthy of his character's redemption.  Scorsese's direction is married perfectly to the music of Peter Gabriel  (the album 'Passion', by the way, is a masterwork in itself).

The movie however has great music but the script and the direction of a director like Scorsese are just plain dull.

I can't help it, I hate this movie.  Now, I'm not merely coming at this from the `tyrannical Christian' point of view, but one cannot help but become stirred when seeing such a tactless interpretation of Christ's life and ministry.  Maybe this is a tad harsh, but for me there are certain aspects of scripture that shouldn't be tampered with in such a strong way, and Christ is an entity who demands respect and admiration and really shouldn't be contorted to fit an artist's idea of what religion stands for.  There are plenty of other earthly men in the scriptures who battled with their own self-doubt and interpreting their struggles accordingly would have been fine, but taking on this alternate account of Christ comes across uncomfortable and insulting.No, I do not think you are a heathen if you watch this movie or even love this movie.  It is all about personal opinion and personal reactions, and my personal reaction was one of disgust.But, like I said, this is not merely from a strictly religious point of view.  As far as the remaining aspects of the film, I find little merit.  The main performances within the film carry little depth, especially Keitel's depiction of Judas as a `GoodFella'.  His thuggish approach (complete with Brooklyn accent) strips away the internal conflictions Judas should have been saddled with and made him a mere one-note antagonist.  This is a real shame, since Judas, whether in this alternate reality or in the real one, is a VERY intriguing and complex character.  Willem Dafoe doesn't fare any better really.  He makes Christ appear so scattered and confused that he loses all aspects of mightiness and simply comes off like a man deranged.  Maybe this was the point, but if it was then it loses all credibility and becomes a pointless narrative.Why be concerned with these conflictions if they are not truly depicted in the body of Christ?  I mean, isn't the whole draw of this film to find the `humanness' in Christ?  If that `human' resembles nothing of Christ, then where is your movie?The film is beautifully shot, the score is haunting, and Scorsese has a knack for creating intriguing atmospheres that linger from frame to frame, but the story feels redundant in parts, uninteresting in many and blasphemous throughout.",1,Not your mother's Jesus Christ...,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,2421,"['chorus', 'valiant', 'defenders', 'Scorsese', 'VERY', 'controversial', 'retelling', 'days', 'Christ', 'bound', 'get', 'heated', 'when', 'see', 'review', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'hate', 'movie', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'merely', 'coming', 'tyrannical', 'Christian', 'point', 'view', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'become', 'stirred', 'when', 'seeing', 'tactless', 'interpretation', 'Christ', 'life', 'ministry', 'Maybe', 'tad', 'harsh', 'are', 'certain', 'aspects', 'scripture', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'tampered', 'such', 'strong', 'way', 'Christ', 'entity', 'who', 'respect', 'admiration', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'contorted', 'fit', 'artist', 'idea', 'what', 'religion', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'earthly', 'men', 'scriptures', 'who', 'battled', 'own', 'self-doubt', 'interpreting', 'struggles', 'accordingly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'taking', 'alternate', 'account', 'Christ', 'uncomfortable', 'insulting.No', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'are', 'heathen', 'watch', 'movie', 'even', 'love', 'movie', 'personal', 'opinion', 'personal', 'reactions', 'personal', 'reaction', 'was', 'one', 'disgust.But', 'said', 'not', 'merely', 'strictly', 'religious', 'point', 'view', 'As', 'far', 'remaining', 'aspects', 'film', 'find', 'little', 'merit', 'main', 'performances', 'film', 'carry', 'little', 'depth', 'especially', 'Keitel', 'depiction', 'Judas', 'GoodFella', 'thuggish', 'approach', 'complete', 'Brooklyn', 'accent', 'away', 'internal', 'conflictions', 'Judas', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'saddled', 'made', 'mere', 'one-note', 'antagonist', 'real', 'shame', 'Judas', 'alternate', 'reality', 'real', 'one', 'VERY', 'intriguing', 'complex', 'character', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', ""n't"", 'fare', 'better', 'really', 'Christ', 'so', 'scattered', 'confused', 'aspects', 'mightiness', 'simply', 'off', 'man', 'deranged', 'Maybe', 'was', 'point', 'was', 'then', 'credibility', 'pointless', 'narrative.Why', 'be', 'concerned', 'conflictions', 'are', 'not', 'truly', 'depicted', 'body', 'Christ', 'mean', ""n't"", 'whole', 'draw', 'film', 'find', 'humanness', 'Christ', 'human', 'resembles', 'nothing', 'Christ', 'then', 'where', 'movie', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'score', 'haunting', 'Scorsese', 'knack', 'creating', 'intriguing', 'atmospheres', 'linger', 'frame', 'frame', 'story', 'feels', 'redundant', 'parts', 'uninteresting', 'many', 'blasphemous']",N/A

But he did. Clocking at 164 minutes, The Last Temptation of Christ is a very positively boring picture that resembles too much of a slow made-for-TV of the week on some religion channel. It doesn't make a difference whether I am an atheist or not; The Last Temptation of Christ is not all that entertaining. So, it is easy to see why the movie has been forgettable. Oddly so, The Last Temptation of Christ has engendered controversy because of some elements contained. Hmm, maybe the viewers need more secular education to better develop their brains? I'm just adhering from point of view of a cin&eacute;aste while judging the film. It gets silly when supernatural moments are reenacted.

182413,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,1559409037,Bomojaz,"[5, 6]","Martin Scorsese's highly controversial account of the Jesus story, based on the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis. The view is of Christ as both man and God and his search within himself to reconcile the two. He is afraid and confused, doesn't know what to say, how to lead. Right up to the crucifixion the story is fairly conventional: miracles are performed, Lazarus is raised, the disciples are gathered, the moneychangers in the Temple are scattered. Judas' role is differently interpreted, though: he is Jesus' strongest disciple, and is told by Jesus to deliberately deceive him so that he can die according to God's will. It is the last half hour, after the crucifixion, that causes all the controversy. Jesus comes down off the cross and is told by an angel that God has seen him suffer enough and there is no need to die - he is not the Messiah. He then marries Mary Magdalene and lives a totally secular life, raising a family.One day he meets Paul preaching about the resurrected Jesus; Jesus confronts him and tells him his story is all a lie, that he is Jesus and he lives like a man. Paul tells him that doesn't matter - it's the resurrected Jesus that people want to hear about, who gives them hope. Then as an old man Jesus is confronted by Judas again, who calls him a traitor for not dying on the cross the way God planned. Jesus begs God's forgiveness and asks to be put back on the cross again, and he is. A dream sequence? Maybe. The angel, of course, was actually the devil.Obviously this isn't the way things are related in the Gospels, though there is so little evidence what actually happened to Jesus after that first Good Friday that this interpretation is not insane. Scorsese treats the material with utmost seriousness and even reverence; the emphasis is on Jesus the man, with all the weaknesses of any man.

As the years went by and I became more familiar with it, I decided it was kind of corny. Then I rented the dvd package and all the extras and commentary helped to renew my respect for this film. There's a lot behind the making of this film and I admire Scorsese's approach. As far as accuracy to the Bible, I have 3 comments: (1) the film says right from the start that it's not based on the gospels, (2) people need to remember that the New Testament as we know it is NOT the original Christianity, and (3) people have been making changes to this religion ever since it sprang into being. If your offended, get over it. I am not a Christian and yet I found this to be a very Christian film. I never felt this film lived up to the controversy. There are more offensive things to Christianity out there (like the novel ""The Last Days Of Christ The Vampire""). The people who made this film believe Jesus actually existed (I DON'T believe he existed), and those who complain are caught up in trivial details. BTW - the actual act of crucifixion is more accurately portrayed in this movie than in any other (based on the archeological evidence from the discovery of the tomb of Jehohanan outside of Jerusalem, the only known remains of a crucified body). I can't say the same for Mel Gibson's ""Passion,"" which a takes a step backward to the Medieval artists concept of crucifixion (highly implausible). Scorsese's film resembles many of his gangster movies in some ways (I agree, that's kind of obnoxious), and he probably could have offered a better representation of the book, but it's still a good film. In my opinion, it's the subject that is challenging. I don't believe you can make a film about Jesus that will please everyone. The gospels can't even agree with each other on certain details. It's like making a film about Robin Hood: that whole myth changed so much over the years, you simply can't create the ""ultimate"" film adaptation which uniformly captures all facets of the myth's evolution. Same with Jesus. Scorsese's attempt is a pretty ambitious one, though. The best I've seen, anyway.

Based on the classic novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, this film was not only a failure at the box office, but also failed as a faithful presentation of Kazantzakis literary masterpiece.The book is poetic, esoteric, surreal and highly hallucinogenic in nature. It appears that Scorsese was unable to capture the spiritual beauty, intensity and multi-textured message of this classic composition and opted for an opposite approach. The film is primitive, earthy and disturbingly barbaric and bloody. His stark, linear vision for this project may have had some limited success artistically but in my opinion did not correspond effectively with the loftier Theological and philosophical concepts revealed in Kazantzakis writings.It's much easier to embrace Scorsese's cinematic interpretation if you haven't read the book. The film is extremely exotic and perversely alluring with an intriquing artsy quality surfacing now and then. Conversely it's also surprisingly uneven and mundane at times with some incredibly slow sections that are difficult to endure. Fortunately I think the last thirty minutes of the film finally connects with Kazantzakis' vision and redeems the film, rewarding the stalwart viewer for the effort spent. 'The Last Temptation of Christ' just might appeal to those tired of the traditional versions of the Jesus Mythos.William Dafoe gives a credible performance as Jesus as does Harvey Keitel in the role of Judas, however the real treasure in this production is the excellent soundtrack by Peter Gabriel.Final Analysis: The film fails as a trustworthy adaptation of the book, but succeeds marginally at providing a stark and uncertain alternative exploration into the mind of Jesus, the God-man.Worthy of seeing at least once.

Now upon repeated viewings I still don't understand.  Perhaps the boundaries crossed that offend those Christians I just don't see.This  film is a good film that follows Jesus through the temptations he has  throughout his life up to and even on the cross.  Based on the characters  in the bible (on a fictitious account however) it is a triumphant story of  human spirit and sacrifice.  Even though they base the story on Jesus, it  could be anyone that is forced to take sacrifices, or strays from the path  selected for the character.The cast is fabulous and they play their  roles with relish.  I really became enthralled in the film and the way  Dafoe plays Jesus is amazing.  When I think I Jesus now, I picture Dafoe.The Criterion DVD is packed with special features as always.  I suppose  there really wasn't a behind the scenes documentary fimed on this movie, so  they got the next best thing.  The personal videotaped account of the  filming by the director!  Of course it is low quality and grainy, but it is  a welcome background piece on the film.There is a technical issue with  this DVD as noted buy Criterion.  While not a terrible  issue it could have problems on some players.  Basically when you load this  DVD in your player, if you do not have a widescreen television, you must  access your DVD player's menu and switch the ratio manually.  It does not  automatically shrink down to fit your screen to preserve the original  aspect ratio.  More specific documentation is available at their website.  Criterion has promised that later pressings of this film will not have this  issue so you may wish to purchase this at a later date if you can  wait.Overall an amazing DVD and I love it!  It is a film I will always  pull out when I need enlightenment.  I also love watching this film with  family and friends to have great discussions afterwards!  The DVD problem  isn't really terrible, a manual setting on your DVD player and it works  fine.

182421,A1ASCECH3KOZ3P,1559409037,C. Gardner,"[4, 6]","&quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; is a very strange film. Parts of it are heavy with literal symbolism, and other parts are rather traditional biblical Hollywood fare. While these two approaches jar against one another, this is definitely not the Jesus of the scriptures, nor the Jesus of scholars. Scorsese's LTC (and the novel on which it's based) asks us to believe that until His trial in the desert, Jesus doubted the things which God put in His heart to tell the world, and shows the evolution of his character, ostensibly over a period of three years, from his retreat into a monastery to the Crucifixion, from an anxiety-ridden young man (whose fear of his own destiny compels him to become a crossmaker for the Romans so that God will reject him) to one filled with certainty. There seems something wrong in this, for starters, but I think the problem is with the script's manner of conveying this change.But the most interesting character is by far Judas (Harvey Keitel), whose Brooklyn accent we have to negotiate before realizing that Keitel's performance is, in a way, the centerpiece of the film. His Judas is a Zealot assassin, a hardened killer filled with hatred towards the Romans and who is asked by his Master to love his enemy and turn the other cheek. Judas scoffs. But he believes. When Jesus tells him he has seen his own crucifixion in prophecy and asks that Judas help him fulfil that destiny, Judas asks why. Jesus replies: Because God gave me the easy part. It's as if to say, even in that act of &quot;betrayal&quot; (scholars mostly don't think it actually happened) was devotion and following the will of God. Judas trusts him and God to the point of doing the most difficult job of the entire story: turning Jesus over to the Jewish authority.Technically, I don't know if it's Scorsese's or editor Thelma Schoonamaker's fault, but half the time it seems like we're entering a the middle of a scene, or the scene is truncated before our emotions are allowed to connect with it. There are some notes which struck me as strange: The Sermon on the Mount is filmed partially with a handheld camera. There's are bits of leaden schlock, too: the Angel, the snakes, the Lion, the flame representing Satan. But Peter Gabriel's eclectic score is one of the best ever, and there are some very powerful moments--Jesus resurrecting Lazarus, his trial in the desert, or the penultimate delirium scenes in which Paul and then Judas berate His spirit for entertaining the Devil's final temptation...However, overall it is too uneven and an ambitious failure.",3,Nice try,1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,2582,"['quot', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ', 'quot', 'very', 'strange', 'film', 'Parts', 'are', 'heavy', 'literal', 'symbolism', 'other', 'parts', 'are', 'rather', 'traditional', 'biblical', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'two', 'approaches', 'jar', 'one', 'definitely', 'not', 'Jesus', 'scriptures', 'Jesus', 'scholars', 'Scorsese', 'LTC', 'novel', 'based', 'believe', 'trial', 'desert', 'Jesus', 'doubted', 'things', 'God', 'put', 'heart', 'tell', 'world', 'evolution', 'character', 'ostensibly', 'period', 'three', 'years', 'retreat', 'monastery', 'Crucifixion', 'anxiety-ridden', 'young', 'man', 'fear', 'own', 'destiny', 'compels', 'become', 'crossmaker', 'Romans', 'God', 'will', 'reject', 'one', 'filled', 'certainty', 'something', 'wrong', 'starters', 'think', 'problem', 'script', 'manner', 'conveying', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'far', 'Judas', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Brooklyn', 'accent', 'have', 'negotiate', 'realizing', 'Keitel', 'performance', 'way', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'Judas', 'Zealot', 'assassin', 'hardened', 'killer', 'filled', 'hatred', 'towards', 'Romans', 'who', 'asked', 'Master', 'love', 'enemy', 'turn', 'other', 'cheek', 'Judas', 'scoffs', 'When', 'Jesus', 'seen', 'own', 'crucifixion', 'prophecy', 'Judas', 'help', 'fulfil', 'destiny', 'Judas', 'why', 'Jesus', 'replies', 'God', 'gave', 'easy', 'part', 'as', 'say', 'even', 'act', 'quot', 'quot', 'scholars', 'mostly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actually', 'happened', 'was', 'devotion', 'following', 'will', 'God', 'Judas', 'God', 'point', 'doing', 'most', 'difficult', 'job', 'entire', 'story', 'turning', 'Jesus', 'Jewish', 'authority.Technically', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Scorsese', 'editor', 'Thelma', 'Schoonamaker', 'fault', 'time', ""'re"", 'entering', 'middle', 'scene', 'scene', 'truncated', 'emotions', 'are', 'allowed', 'connect', 'are', 'notes', 'struck', 'strange', 'Sermon', 'Mount', 'filmed', 'partially', 'handheld', 'camera', 'are', 'bits', 'leaden', 'schlock', 'too', 'Angel', 'snakes', 'Lion', 'flame', 'representing', 'Satan', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'eclectic', 'score', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'are', 'very', 'powerful', 'moments', 'Jesus', 'resurrecting', 'Lazarus', 'trial', 'desert', 'penultimate', 'delirium', 'scenes', 'Paul', 'then', 'Judas', 'berate', 'spirit', 'entertaining', 'Devil', 'final', 'temptation', 'However', 'overall', 'too', 'uneven', 'ambitious', 'failure']",N/A

It seems like anytime some unlucky sod decides to make a film about Christ, people are going to complain and picket. In 1988 (was it that long ago?) director Martin Scorsese made an extraordinary film that was greeted with equal fervor - &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ.&quot;The film &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; is an incredible achievement, with earnest performances, thoughtful dialogue (based on the Nikos Kazantzakis novel of the same name) and the always-imaginative direction of Scorsese. I applauded how human and identifiable Jesus Christ was portrayed.When watching &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ,&quot; one has the feeling if this story truly did happen, then it would have happened much as it did in this film. It is violent, coarse and inspirational. The great controversy was its portrayal of Christ having an affair with prostitute Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey). But it's not really an affair more than it is Christ, at the moment of death, imagining life's choices. Just what if he had chosen a life of domestic simplicity and warm security with Mary, rather than take responsibility for his calling?I think people are so used to Christ being portrayed as this superhuman being, eyes ocean blue and unblinking, gliding across the desert swan-like (like TV's &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;). In one of the great film epics of all time &quot;Ben-Hur,&quot; director William Wyler doesn't even show Jesus. Oh, we see his back at one point, his hand in yet another scene. But Jesus is left to our imagination, which is probably the best way to go about this subject matter anyway.So for Jesus to be played by a relatively awkward looking man in Willem Dafoe, human, with genuine insecurities and fears, is an inspirational and unique stance.

182423,A3HN4OZBYVDTU6,1559409037,"Crypt ""thecrypt777""","[15, 19]","There are two things that I am going to say before I review this film.1. I have been a believer my whole life. I have been a Christian proper for about half of it. I have also rejected the fake religiosity and vain piety that modern Churchianity has imposed upon faith and spirituality. It's this that removes the ""magic"" and power of the Bible and its message.2. I am not going to compare this film to Mel Gibson's Passion. That would be unfair since both films are coming from two completely different, yet equally valid points of view.The Last Temptation of Christ is, in my opinion, one of the greatest and most powerful religious films ever made. Its purpose was to use the story of Jesus and his victory over the world and over fallen humanity as a metaphor for man's struggle between the Spirit and the Flesh. The Christ we see in this movie is in essence Nikos Kazantzakis (the author of the original novel which this film is based upon), Paul Schrader (screenwriter) and Martin Scorcese (director). Each person infused a bit of themselves into this vision of Christ in an attempt to put themselves in His sandals, to experience the Passion, Glory and Horror of Christ's life, ministry and death for themselves and that way become closer to Him. They've created a modern parable for just about anyone with an open mind and an open heart; a ""supreme model for the man who struggles"" as Kazantzakis states in the introduction to his novel.Yes, the Jesus we see in this film is quite insecure, confused and at times downright terrified. The point is, when God calls someone to accomplish such a seemingly impossible mission, who isn't scared to death? Who wouldn't rather live an average life in comfort than endure the emotional and physical torture of being God's sacrificial lamb? This film speculates ""What if Jesus the carpenter had these feelings? If he was fully human as well as fully divine, who's to say that the carpenter wasn't terrified when he learned that he was in fact, the Christ?"" The next point the film addresses is that while Jesus was tempted in every way... including sexual temptation (maybe the strongest kind), He never once gave in. Even at his weakest and most vulnerable point, bloody, thrashed beyond recognition and dying on the cross, when he experiences his ""Last Temptation"" - that of leading a normal human life (including marriage, work, child raising, etc) - he shakes off the temptation and shouts triumphantly, ""It is accomplished!"" And thank God it was!I will point out that there are major historical and Biblical inaccuracies in the film. But then again, this film never claimed to be accurate. Its message and power isn't in its accuracy, but in its essence. It unfolds in a very dream-like and surreal way. However its grit and realism as far as locations, and details such as the actual crucifixion are more historically correct than most film versions.Overall this is a profound expression of faith coming from film makers who based their work on a profound expression of faith by one of the greatest writers of modern literature we have. It continues to inspire me to do my best and follow God's calling despite my fears and insecurities. There was something Roger Ebert said about this film having the power to draw more people to Christ than any film before it. He may have been right.

When I saw it, I had no idea it was the controversial, much-hated work that it apparently is, primarily to those who regard Jesus as too sacred a personage to place within a work of fiction that (they've heard) conflicts with their reverent notions of this most famous individual. I've seen this impressive film many times and have had my share of conversations about it, and one universal theme seems to be present: those who have seen this motion picture speak well of it, and those who haven't scorn it. Such is the world, huh?The Last Temptation of Christ brings Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis' finely-woven novel about the life and works of Jesus to the big screen in this vast, gritty, panoramic tale courtesy of master filmmaker Martin Scorsese. The movie depicts a human world still raw in its youth, and a society seething with resistance to oppression, divided from within, conquered from without, as the Jewish people struggle to maintain their identity in the face of a foreign presence that threatens to stifle them as no invader ever quite has.In this world lives a simple country man, Jesus of Nazareth, a soul deeply tormented by the conflicting desires that dwell within him. Mirroring his nation, Jesus is one in whom peace is not to be found. Endowed with a sense of purpose, but purpose which mystifies him, the visionary Jesus seeks answers first in an Essene community in the wilderness, later among the outer world, where he preaches and tells parables. Jesus quests to come to know himself and his mission, and in this is aided by his friend and most loyal disciple, the zealot Judas Iscariot, who seeks above all the independence of Judea.Does Jesus exist, as Judas hopes, to topple the Roman invaders with violence, or is it Jesus' path to serve his destiny through example and holy works?  Above all Jesus feels drawn to step away and live his days in the simplicity of normal life, a husband and father whose back is turned on the world and its evils, and it is via this that Satan tempts Christ, even on the cross.

Here Christ (Willem Dafoe) is fully human, susceptible to all the weaknesses and temptations of man, tormented by his communications with God, which he does not at first understand.  In the beginning, his behavior bears all the symptoms of a man suffering from brain damage or a mental illness--seizures, pain, hallucinations.  Soon, however, he begins to perform miracles and gather disciples, chief among whom is Judas (Harvey Keitel), whose relationship with Jesus is a fascinating revision of what we know of him from the Bible.The power of Scorcese's film is undercut by some pretty serious miscalculations.  Although Dafoe is excellent, much of the cast appears to consist of New York method actors who do not inhabit the time and place of the story convincingly.  The appearance of David Bowie (in the small but significant role of Pontius Pilate) tore me right out of the film.  Peter Gabriel is an excellent musician, but his score, which blends Middle Eastern motifs with rock rhythms and electric guitar, was also a distraction.

I was not very religious even though I believed in God but I was confused about my beliefs.  I was still learning about life and wasn't ready to completely know the truth and study the Bible.  This was (and still is) a very controversial film.  It's not biblically correct and at the beginning of the movie, there is a statement that admits it is NOT based on the Gospels in the New Testament but on a book someone wrote called ""The Last Temptation of Christ"".  So, I didn't expect it to be accurate.  But now, I have seen it again on TV on ""Bravo"" (they are probably trying to cash in on Mel Gibson's movie controversy) and I find this movie offensive, distasteful and repulsive.  The more I have learned about the life of Jesus and His teachings, the more I see this movie as a complete joke and mockery of what He was trying to teach us.The beginning of the movie is so repugnant and idiotic that it made me mad.  I don't mind that Jesus was portrayed as ""more human"" than in past movies made about Him.  But there are actual lies and distortions about what He did and said that could mislead someone that is not familiar with the Gospels and the New Testament.  There were several scenes in the movie that portrayed Jesus as a liar and a coward.  There was definitely a subliminal intension made in this movie to make Jesus seem like only ""He"" thought He was the Son of God and there wasn't any reasonable proof that He was except for a few scenes of miracles - (but the subliminal story made it obvious to me that Jesus was or could be a charlatan or magician).  At one point in the movie, Jesus pulls out His own heart and holds it in His hand - (This scene reminds me of quacks and charlatans that remove tumors and diseases with their hands from poor ignorant people that don't know any better.  They use magician's tricks, like a dead animal's blood and organs; to fool people into thinking they are curing them of some disease).  Even the words Jesus spoke in the movie were so ridiculous that you would have to be a moron to believe this guy was the ""messiah"" if you were one of His followers in this movie.Jesus was portrayed as a very confused man and was overwhelmed with guilt for building the crosses that the Romans used to crucify His own people (which isn't in the Bible, of course). So, He found ways to mutilate Himself (as penance for His own sins) and in the end, He died on a cross that He probably made Himself. I just find the movie repulsive and hard to watch. It's a twisted and perverted viewpoint of Jesus.This is not a well-made movie and it says nothing to inspire or teach anything new - it's just a slap in the face of Christianity in general.  I believe that the people, including the director that made this movie had a right to make this movie.  But I have a right to hate this movie and to completely be disgusted by it.

182439,A1SE0248RACMPY,1559409037,FiLmFrEaK99,"[10, 11]","""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is a very personal film from Martin Scorsese that attempts to understand the myth of Jesus from a human perspective. What other perspective is there, really? So as a result, Jesus the Man does not exactly act like Jesus the Lord in the film, at least in the biblical sense, but the film is not trying to be faithful to biblical texts. ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is more of a meditation on what it means to be ""the son of God;"" a struggle that people of religion should empathize with considering they are trying to live up to being ""a son of God."" Yet even though the overall outcome and message is in accordance with the symbolic nature of Christ, the depiction of Jesus in the film still offends many people because he is apparently too ""human.""Now there are many laurels to this film from the Modernist Master. For one, the film showcases some great performances (if you can get past their New York accents), particularly that of Willem Dafoe, who plays Jesus. Although Dafoe, at times, overplays the subtleties and mystique of Jesus, he still turns in a wonderful performance. The cinematography is excellent. Scorsese modeled a lot of his shots after ancient biblical paintings, and the cinematographer catches the right tones and colors, bringing a certain authenticity to the film. Consider the slow motion scene where Jesus is carrying the cross through the throngs of pig-like faces. As far as directing, well it speaks for itself. Like other great directors, Scorsese made the film to try and answer questions within his own soul. ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is as much about Scorsese as it is about Jesus; why else would the characters sound like they were from New York? :-)Faith and Redemption are two themes that are underscored in all of Scorsese's films; in ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" those themes are laid out to bare. Scorsese is not trying to reinterpret biblical texts, but to understand them.  The humanization of Jesus in the film is no different than the multiple artworks that portray him as fair skinned, dark haired, and caucasian. What makes Jesus human in the film is not so much his sins, but his capacity to make choices. Jesus the Lord was destined to die on the cross from the moment he was conceived; Jesus the Man 'chooses' to die for humanity's sin. Without doubt or temptation, where is the sacrifice? Jesus' choice is the path to faith and redemption. What comes about is not so much a film about God, but about humanity.""The Last Temptation of Christ"" needs to be seen with an open mind. Like the Bible, the film's message is not in its context, but in its subtexts.

After all, many of the major religious figures in America were blasting the film. The thought was how blasphemous that Christ would have had any human feelings when hanging from the cross. What I found, instead, was a well filmed, but largely boring piece of celluloid.The film is taken from a book by Nikos Kazantzakis, and does very little justice to the wonderfully poetic prose Kazantzakis writes. While true to Kazantzakis' gnostic telling of the life of Christ, the film feels much too contemporary in many parts. This is largely due to the Scorsese touch.If you watch a film to see its imagery, this film is beautifully filmed. If you like to watch good acting, you will also have a pleasant experience. If you want to be moved, as only art can do, you will come away a bit empty.As for the controversy, the points on which biblical leaders attacked the film on are largely inconsequential. Realistically, had they actually watched the film, they would have been more shocked by the subtle points, rather than the last temptation. This leads me to believe that few of the detractors even knew what the film stood for.Compared to many of the films of the past 15 - 20 years, this one certainly fairs better than most. This is primarily due to the fact that so much of the tripe Hollywood puts out contains characatures rather than characters. Rating this film based on what Hollywood puts out, one would have to rank it higher, as it shines in comparison. I choose, however, to rate it based on the elements that I feel makes good art; as such, average is about the best I can rate this.I find that most people that feel strongly one way or another on this film do so on their own personal belief of Christ rather than the merits of the film.

182443,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,1559409037,General Breadbasket,"[7, 9]","St Paul described Jesus as being ""one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are - yet was without sin"" (Hebrews 4v15). ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", a film based on the book by Nikos Kazanantzakis, is an exploration of such verses of the Bible, I think. It shows a Jesus who is tempted in pretty much every way imaginable, in the mind and in reality, who is vulnerable, who learns as he goes, and yet still doesn't sin, still preaches love and God's kingdom with confidence, and still fulfils his purpose. For me, it's one of the most interesting interpretations of Jesus life, around, and is definitely one of my favorites.The film opens with an explanation. This is not a version of the gospel story. This is an exploration of Jesus' substance, and the battles against sin, and the weight of expectation that he fought. I admired the honesty, personally. This isn't a film that pretending to be something it isn't. That's not to say there aren't Biblical elements in the film. There certainly are, a lot of Jesus teachings are explored, spoken in a more modern way (the parable of the sower, the idea of ""he who is without sin, cast the first stone"", etc), and many of the things described in the Bible that he did (the Wedding of Cana, the resurrection of Lazarus, his entry into Jerusalem, etc). A fair bit is speculated on and embellished though. Mary Madgadelene is Jesus friend from childhood here, Jesus pulls out his heart and shows it to his followers as a miracle, and Judas Iscariot (the man who betrayed Jesus) is the first disciple, to name a few. In fact, Judas is explored rather deeply here. Rather than being the pantomime villain he's portrayed as in some interpretations of the gospels, he's a complex individual. ""Last Temptation""'s Judas is a man who wants to be freed from Roman rule as quickly as possible, who is intellegent, and though a little gruff and impatient at times, cares for people and has feelings just like anyone else. In this film, he is one of Jesus' closest friends, and one of the ones who understood what he was all about early on.Jesus is equally as complex. Rather than being the stoic figure he so often is seen as in movies and paintings, he's a very vulnerable man. As he grows up, he's not sure what these feelings, ideas and sense of destiny is. It's confusing and painful for him. Is it God his Father, or is it deception that leads him on, that's what ""Last Temptation's"" Jesus struggles with in his mind. What's the most important of the teachings that flows from his heart? Love? The destruction of evil? His upcoming sacrifice? What should he say to the people so they hear his message? What shouldn't he say? Should he say anything at all? If he does, how should he say it? He is flooded with pressure and possibilities. Mary Magdalene is a childhood friend, and he struggles to speak to her soul. Her soul, she says, is her body, which she gives as a prostitute and would like to give to him. He is faced with all these temptations and more, worst of all on the cross, and yet he overcomes them all and doesn't sin once. William Dafoe, though not the first man you'd think for a Jesus role, captured this mental anguish, and this inner strength, really, really well. You can really see the heart in his portrayal. This is the kind of suffering you can learn something from, can be inspired by, can relate to, unlike the blood, thunder and guilt of a film like ""Passion of the Christ"". Speaking of ""The Passion"", the crucifixition scenes are mercifully short in ""Last Temptation"", but do capture the physical pain well enough.Peter Gabriel does the soundtrack, which is a rather famous piece in its own right (the CD is called ""Passion""). I can understand why, it suits the film really well. The more studio bound parts of the score remind me a little of Gabriel's album ""Security"", with the the low pitched, moody samples and gated drums, while the more natural, world music inspired parts, are wonderfully organic, and really evoke Israel and Mesopotamia under the dominion of the Roman Empire. The sets and costumes too stir up the past just as well, as well as the behavior of the crowds. I also liked the fact there were a few red-haired Jewish people in the crowds, and among the disciples. I mean, in these kind of films, you usually see a lot of black hair and not much else, little bit of a stereotype.I was on a Christian internet forum talking about movies portraying Jesus. I'm not a big fan of ""The Passion of the Christ"", and I was saying that surely there were better alternatives for Christians to recommend, that incorporated more of the teachings of Jesus. Being a fan of Peter Gabriel, I suggested that maybe ""Last Temptation of Christ"" might be worth seeing. There was a bit of disagreement. ""Last Temptation"" was far too inaccurate to be of any benefit, I was told, and then given a list of all these things that happen in the film that are way off the track.  After actually watching the film, I see that half of the list they gave me were gross exaggerations and misinterpretations of the scenes. I know the scenes they were supposed to be referring to, though, and I know how they could have been misinterpreted. If you walk out of the room to make a cup of tea, there's a good chance you'll miss some context. It might be a fantasy scene you come back to, a temptation sent by Satan, a mere possibility and not something that's actually happening. It's one of those films you have to pay attention, and have to actively think about and consider as you go. That's the reason why I'm giving this film 4 stars, it can be easily misinterpreted and misused if put in the wrong context, or if one scene was played by itself to someone, or if someone just catches the beginning, or just the ending.There is a series of scenes that could be seen as particularly offensive to Christians towards the end, but it really isn't given the context. I'm a Christian, and I did feel a little uncomfortable, but somehow I knew there was a point to it. ""This had better be going somewhere"" I said, and my Mum (who likes to watch these sort of films with me) agreed. I was right, and when those scenes were resolved I cheered, literally cheered, it heightened the emotion impact of the ending so much. If you feel a little rattled and confused towards the ending like I was, be a bit slower in your anger and offense about it, be patient with it. It makes a really good point, I felt, provided it's understood.The mental struggle of Jesus was a nice theme for Martin Scorsese to tackle. He seems to be drawn to struggles of the mind (like Howard Hughes obsessiveness in ""The Aviator""). Peter Gabriel, too, seems rather appropriate, a man who often slips in Biblical metaphors in his songs (both in Genesis and solo) and loves to explore the emotional state of people in his lyrics.Overall, I'm really glad I watched it. It was a well thought out piece, well directed, with great music. It makes me a little angry that the very people who would gain the most from this, people who have struggles just like their teacher, king and role-model did, are the ones most likely to turn off halfway.

Clearly, Dafoe was in way over his head.  His acting is so bland and weak, there isn't much to admire in his performance of perhaps the most famous person in the history of the world.

An examination of Christ as a man, a human being who struggles to come to terms with being granted prophet hood.  A man who while rejecting this and all that comes with it is compelled to act in accordance with a mission he has been sent with.Interesting idea and one that would be well worth watching problem is 1. The choice of actors for the film 2. The roles they are given.With such a film you need a cast who are strong enough to carry it out in its correct historical context this film sadly does not have it.  What comes off is not a historical reading of the life of Jesus examining an otherwise overlooked aspect of his life but rather ""Jesus goes gangster""Take the scene where Jesus visits Mary Magdalene in a brothel.  After Jesus sits for a while amongst her clients (most of whom seem to be black (as well as the local slaves) more of Scorsese's odd obsession with black people but that's another issue) after they all depart they debate on how he has his calling to dwell in the desert, Mary feels abandoned and they argue.  The argument (both language and context) would be more suited to a 40s Al Capone flick or better still the episode of the Simpson's where he thinks back to his days raising the kids in ""Little Italy""  The body language, the terminology used everything was just so out of place.Take the scene where Jesus speaks with one of his disciples, the disciple says to him ""I will follow you but if you stray this far from the path..... (As he holds his hand up in trademark Gangster fashion)I'll kill you""  Or the scene where he first speaks to the people after saving Mary ""He told me stand up and here I am"" With arrogant head back, eyes half closed, arms stretched out looked more like 'King of New York' than 'Jesus the Messiah'The disciples come together more like 'wise guys' joining a 'crew' than followers of a prophet.  There is even a bit of slow motion Reservoir Dogs style strut to the camera with music played over!Why on earth has Scorsese done this?  Did he think it would bring Jesus closer to the moder audience?  Did he think the protests would be too busy....well protesting to even bother watching the film and examining weather it was actually a good film or not to criticise its quality rather than its context?  Who knows.The idea behind the film though is excellent.  Its almost ironic that someone who is religious would probably get a lot of benefit from the film.  The meditation and temptation of Jesus both from within and beyond him.  This part of the film is remarkable I only wish the so called 'critics' could have watched this part as it really shows what separated the prophets from the normal man, the need of God and religion and the simplicity of faith.For the idea of the film I would give it 5 stars if only Scorsese had not destroyed it with this monster of a film!",3,Good grief!,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,2894,"['idea', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'remarkable', 'one', 'examination', 'Christ', 'man', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'come', 'terms', 'being', 'granted', 'prophet', 'hood', 'man', 'who', 'rejecting', 'compelled', 'act', 'accordance', 'mission', 'been', 'sent', 'with.Interesting', 'idea', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'problem', '1', 'choice', 'actors', 'film', '2', 'roles', 'are', 'given.With', 'such', 'film', 'need', 'cast', 'who', 'are', 'strong', 'enough', 'carry', 'out', 'correct', 'historical', 'context', 'film', 'sadly', 'not', 'have', 'What', 'off', 'not', 'historical', 'reading', 'life', 'Jesus', 'examining', 'otherwise', 'overlooked', 'aspect', 'life', 'rather', 'Jesus', 'gangster', 'Take', 'scene', 'where', 'Jesus', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'brothel', 'Jesus', 'while', 'amongst', 'clients', 'most', 'whom', 'seem', 'be', 'black', 'as', 'well', 'local', 'slaves', 'more', 'Scorsese', 'odd', 'obsession', 'black', 'people', 'issue', 'depart', 'debate', 'how', 'calling', 'dwell', 'desert', 'Mary', 'feels', 'abandoned', 'argue', 'argument', 'language', 'context', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'suited', '40s', 'Al', 'Capone', 'flick', 'better', 'still', 'episode', 'Simpson', 'where', 'back', 'days', 'raising', 'kids', 'Little', 'Italy', 'body', 'language', 'terminology', 'used', 'everything', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'place.Take', 'scene', 'where', 'Jesus', 'one', 'disciples', 'disciple', 'will', 'follow', 'stray', 'far', 'path', '..', 'hand', 'up', 'trademark', 'Gangster', 'fashion', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'scene', 'where', 'first', 'people', 'saving', 'Mary', 'told', 'stand', 'up', 'here', 'am', 'arrogant', 'head', 'back', 'eyes', 'half', 'closed', 'arms', 'stretched', 'out', 'looked', 'more', ""'King"", 'New', 'York', ""Messiah'The"", 'disciples', 'come', 'together', 'more', 'like', ""'wise"", 'guys', 'joining', ""'crew"", 'followers', 'prophet', 'even', 'bit', 'slow', 'motion', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'style', 'strut', 'camera', 'music', 'played', 'Why', 'earth', 'Scorsese', 'done', 'think', 'would', 'bring', 'Jesus', 'closer', 'moder', 'audience', 'Did', 'think', 'protests', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'busy', '.well', 'protesting', 'even', 'bother', 'watching', 'film', 'examining', 'weather', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'criticise', 'quality', 'rather', 'context', 'Who', 'knows.The', 'idea', 'film', 'though', 'excellent', 'almost', 'ironic', 'someone', 'who', 'religious', 'would', 'probably', 'get', 'lot', 'benefit', 'film', 'meditation', 'temptation', 'Jesus', 'part', 'film', 'remarkable', 'only', 'wish', 'so', 'called', ""'critics"", 'could', 'have', 'watched', 'part', 'really', 'what', 'separated', 'prophets', 'normal', 'man', 'need', 'God', 'religion', 'simplicity', 'faith.For', 'idea', 'film', 'would', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'only', 'Scorsese', 'had', 'not', 'destroyed', 'monster', 'film']",N/A

It kicked off an enormous amount of controversy that has faded to some degree, but the film was almost impossible to see upon its release in 1988, and when it came to home video.  I had to drive 20 miles to an obscure video store (which has closed down) to find it on video.  I did, and I adore this film.  It isn't perfect (some dialogue is actually quite bad, especially Jesus's voiceover dialogue, and some of the supporting players aren't very good), but overall, it's a visually impressive, passionate, and articulate telling of the Christ story.  It's amusing that people picketed this film, as Martin Scorsese (who should have won an Oscar for this film) is Roman Catholic, Paul Schrader, the screenwriter, is a Calvinist, and the original author, Nikos Kazantzakis, was in the Greek Orthodox Church.  These men are very, very familiar with the Christ story, and they handle the material with passion, intelligence, and grace.  It's quite a moving film, especially in the lengthy final hallucination scene, which is amazing powerful.  The title is very accurate for the final scene, the last temptation.  Willem Dafoe is very good at Jesus, Barbara Hershey is excellent as Mary Magadelene, and Harvey Keitel is a great Judas.  The film differs from the Gospels (which it mentions in the opening credits), but it's still a profound retelling of the greatest story ever told.  It is also one of Martin Scorsese's best films, much better than his recent Oscar winner, The Departed.  The story of the Christ is one that can be retold over and over again, so there's really no such thing as a ""remake/reimagining"" about it.  I rank this with the great films about Christ, like George Stevens's The Greatest Story Ever Told, Cecil B. DeMille's King of Kings, Franco Zefferelli's Jesus of Narazeth, and Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew.  All five of them are moving and passionate, yet different at the same time.

(an otherwise excellent film-maker; see ""The Age Of Innocence,"" ""Gangs Of New York"") is nothing more than complete and utter BLASPHEMY. It not only perpetuates the heresy that Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, was not 100% divine, but also shows Him giving into sexual temptation and (willingly or not) kissing Judas on the lips. These, and other scenes, should serve to keep any true believer away from this movie. I was warned about the heretical content, but decided to view a clip or two online to see for myself (as I would NEVER, EVER, EVER debase myself by watching heresy; I thought about seeing it, which was in itself a temptation), and it is worse than I thought. I read the synopsis on Wikipedia and was horrified at the actual content, which is an utter blasphemy. The Gospel According To Saint John (chapter 3, verse 16) says , ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him, should not perish, but have everlasting life."" And The Revelation Of St. John (chapter 22, verses 18 and 19) say, ""For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."" Mr. S. has done both things; he has taken away and added to the Word of God, things which ought not to be done. Read the Holy Bible (preferably the KJV, as the post-KJV translations water down the Message of God's Word, especially the homosexual-friendly new international version) and avoid this heretical excuse for a movie, which is excrement. The Word Of God is true. You won't be damned if you're a Christian and you see this movie , but if you are a Christian, you would do well to NOT see this film, as you would know better than an unconverted the Truth of God.

Despite growing up as a Jew in Israel and having no connection to Christianity, I have long been fascinated by the story of Jesus and the many different cinematic and literary interpretations of it, be it humorous (Monty Python's `Life Of Brian'), musical (Andrew Lloyd Webber's `Jesus Christ Superstar') or authentic. Martin Scorsese's `Last Temptation Of Christ', based on Nikos Kazantaki's novel of the same name, takes a very original and unusual view on the life of Christ, and sheds a light on him that is both criticizing and sympathetic, presenting him to be a much more human-like character than we are used to expect. With much help from inspired and brilliant acting by Willem Defoe - certainly not anyone's first choice for the character, who approaches this very difficult character as originally as Scorsese does - the master director does extremely well in creating this unusual version of Christ, and makes him understandable and recognizable in a whole new way.Originality and controversy aside, `The Last Temptation Of Christ' is a wonderful masterpiece of cinema, and one of Scorsese's most impressive works, standing with greats like `Taxi Driver' and `Raging Bull' in suspense and atmosphere. His directing and the photography are superb, and he transfers the story of Jesus to the big screen like few others could. Also praiseworthy are many members of the cast - Barbara Hershey is spectacular as Mary Magdalene, as are Harry Dean Stanton as Paul and, in a surprisingly good casting choice, David Bowie (that's right!) as Pilate. Harvey Keitel as Judas Iscariot supplies a good match for Defoe's Christ, but he really is the weaker link in the bunch, as he is not nearly as original as the rest of the cast. Finally, I must mention the great genius Mr. Peter Gabriel, who supplied for this film one of the most brilliant and groundbreaking musical scores to appear in a motion picture, which adds enormously to its atmosphere. It can be obtained on audio CD under the title `Passion: Music For The Last Temptation Of Christ', and remains a landmark of progressive and avant-garde music.If you're open-minded and are not afraid of breaking of taboos, `The Last Temptation Of Christ' is by all means an essentiality. Do try to take it for what it is and not to be offended, because the film is not intended as a documentation of the life of Christ or criticism against him; it is merely an interpretation of that timeless story, which tries - and succeeds - to shed new light on it.

Having finally gotten the nerve(as a devoted Christian) to obtain a copy of LTOChrist...I can honestly say that it was nowhere near as heretical as my right-wing fundamentalist/evangelical brothers & sisters had made it out to be(without actually seeing the film). It feels like only yesterday that I ventured out to the Phipps Plaza in ATL to protest bitterly against this film along-side my parents and other well-intending Christians...and now, nearly 10 years later, upon watching the film and having heard what the movie REALLY entails(and what it doesn't), I see it for what it really is, a masterpiece depicting Jesus' humanity in paradox with His deity. YES...there were some extremes(ie, Jesus being ""led"" into Mary Magdalene's ""place"" of business, being slapped around by Judas for building crosses, flinching when lazarus came forth, the headaches/seizures,etc), but overall, we're seeing a picture of Christ being ""touched with all of our infirmities, yet without sin."" What I'd heard through the born-again grapevine was overly exaggerated until I saw it...the marriage to Mary Magdalene, Maary,Sister of Lazarus, and the confrontation with Paul are all dream sequences that end with an answer to the eternal 'WHAT IF'(ie, the state of Israel and the world if Christ had come down off of the cross). Bottom line is, the church abroad could not receive this film because they only wanted to embrace Jesus' deity...but to quote once of my favorite Conyers,GA pastors, to embrace only the Christ Who is God is to embrace only HALF of the Christ, to embrace the REAL Christ is to embrace the GOD AND MAN in Christ. Now the movie DOES have a dark,out there feel...as many of us would expect from Mr. Scorcese, however, I rest my case...the movie is no less true to the Christ than the Passion...OPEN YOUR MIND,SEE THE MOVIE, and GLORIFY GOD that CHRIST STAYED ON THE CROSS.

Eret,"[13, 15]","For years Hollywood made epic works based on the Bible and I liked most  them because they were full of color and action and strange sights to a  young boy. I never &quot;thought&quot; much about these works, what it  meant to me spiritually until I saw the video version of Martin Scorcese's  beautiful &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ.&quot; Few theaters in town  would show the film. Many of its critics, when asked if they saw it, said  no, but it was an evil film. Nothing could be further from the truth. This  is Nikos Kanzanzakis's Truth and Martin Scorcese's Truth. It is a film of  deep thought and deeper feeling. Christ steps off the untouchable space  films have bound him in and shows very human wants and leanings and faults.  We can now support him and identify with his sufferings. The cast is a  strong one. William Dafoe is superb as Jesus, emoting the right balance of  doubt and strength when needed.Harvey Keitel is interesting as Judas and  many have said he sounds strange talking with a New York accent. Well Dafoe  is from the east also and Scorsese lets all the actors speak in their  natural voices and not in a trumped up, phony Biblical language that has  marred so many previous historical epics. Scorsese scales the story down,  with no cast of thousands but uses his crowd scenes wisely to show  power.Backed by a wondrous score by Peter Gabriel, one of my favorites,  this powerful story rages with deep feeling and spirituality. This movie  was obviously a passion for Scorsese and he uses all of his considerable  talent to win us over, to make us empathise with Christ, to follow him like  his disciples through deserts of doubt, anger and love, and finally the  crucifixtion, which is staged powerfully. Here Christ is tempted one last  time and many critics say the movie goes overboard when Christ marries, has  sex and a family and then understands that he must resist this last  temptation to lead a &quot;normal&quot; life so others may, from his death,  go on to a better understanding of themselves. It is a masterpiece, a great  personal vision of Martin Scorcese. And in my own personal quest ,through  movies, to view a movie with great thought an vision of understanding  behind it was over.It is a great movie to be viewed again and again and  talked about with family, friends, and all those who want to live a better  life.",5,The Last Temptation of Christ: It is Accomplished!,960422400,"06 8, 2000",2000,2378,"['years', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'epic', 'works', 'based', 'Bible', 'liked', 'most', 'were', 'full', 'color', 'action', 'strange', 'sights', 'young', 'boy', 'never', 'quot', 'thought', 'quot', 'much', 'works', 'what', 'meant', 'spiritually', 'saw', 'video', 'version', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'beautiful', 'quot', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ.', 'quot', 'Few', 'theaters', 'town', 'would', 'show', 'film', 'Many', 'critics', 'when', 'asked', 'saw', 'said', 'was', 'evil', 'film', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'Nikos', 'Kanzanzakis', 'Truth', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'Truth', 'film', 'deep', 'thought', 'deeper', 'feeling', 'Christ', 'untouchable', 'space', 'films', 'have', 'bound', 'very', 'human', 'leanings', 'faults', 'can', 'now', 'support', 'identify', 'sufferings', 'cast', 'strong', 'one', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'superb', 'Jesus', 'emoting', 'right', 'balance', 'doubt', 'strength', 'when', 'needed.Harvey', 'Keitel', 'interesting', 'Judas', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'strange', 'talking', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'Well', 'Dafoe', 'east', 'also', 'Scorsese', 'lets', 'actors', 'speak', 'natural', 'voices', 'not', 'trumped', 'up', 'phony', 'Biblical', 'language', 'marred', 'so', 'many', 'previous', 'historical', 'epics', 'Scorsese', 'story', 'down', 'cast', 'thousands', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'wisely', 'show', 'power.Backed', 'wondrous', 'score', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'one', 'favorites', 'powerful', 'story', 'rages', 'deep', 'feeling', 'spirituality', 'movie', 'was', 'obviously', 'passion', 'Scorsese', 'considerable', 'talent', 'win', 'over', 'make', 'empathise', 'Christ', 'follow', 'disciples', 'deserts', 'doubt', 'anger', 'love', 'finally', 'crucifixtion', 'staged', 'powerfully', 'Here', 'Christ', 'tempted', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'many', 'critics', 'say', 'movie', 'overboard', 'when', 'Christ', 'marries', 'sex', 'family', 'then', 'must', 'resist', 'last', 'temptation', 'lead', 'quot', 'normal', 'quot', 'life', 'others', 'may', 'death', 'go', 'better', 'understanding', 'masterpiece', 'great', 'personal', 'vision', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'own', 'personal', 'quest', 'movies', 'view', 'movie', 'great', 'thought', 'vision', 'understanding', 'was', 'over.It', 'great', 'movie', 'be', 'viewed', 'again', 'again', 'talked', 'family', 'friends', 'who', 'want', 'live', 'better', 'life']",N/A

Jesus getting a free pass from the Cross, marrying and having a family? Preposterous as these casting and plot elements sound, director Martin Scorcese comes very close to making them work.Scorcese more or less faithfully adapts Nikos Kazantzakis's controversial novel to the big screen. Jesus is a tortured young man, best by nightmares and obsessed with the idea of crucifixion. He helps Romans crucify fellow Jews, to the dismay and opprobrium of his townsfolk. Sensing himself full of sin, he repairs to an Essene-like desert monastery. Finally, he comes to accept his destiny as Savior, with its gruesome end, and is on his way as (more or less) the Jesus of the Gospels. Yet Satan has a final snare for Jesus. While Jesus suffers on the Cross, Satan (in the guise of an angelic child) shows him scenes of how pleasant life could be if he turned down death on the Cross - a normal life with wife Mary Magdalene, children and easy old age with no agony or pain.Conservatives dislike the film. One local video store actually had it on a back shelf like some piece of smut. But I see much heart in it -- sometimes literally. One scene (wrenched out of Scorcese's Roman Catholic childhood) shows Jesus pulling his still beating heart out of his body - an allusion to the Sacred Heart devotion. Childhood allusions aside, ""Last Temptation,"" though a work of deep feeling and faith, fails the good doctrine test. A nightmare-tormented Jesus is one thing; a Jesus who confesses to being ""full of sin:"" is quite another. I guess I still find the official Church teaching of Christ's sinlessness as compelling. Still, Scorcese's attempt to depict Christ's humanity is impressive.Scorcese predates Mel Gibson (and with more success, IMHO) by trying to bring some historical verisimilitude to the Crucifixion scene. In 1968, the bones of a crucifixion victim were unearthed near Jerusalem, with a nail being pounded into the sides of the ankles, not into the top of the feet as usually depicted. Scholarly conjecture was that the victim's legs were twisted sideways, allowing the ankles to be nailed to the front of the cross,. This forced the victim's body into a weird, almost seated posture. Scorcese uses this posture in his crucifixion scene, though, oddly, only for Jesus. (More recent studies suggest that ankle-nailed feet would have been pounded into the sides (not the front) of the cross.In any event,. You can't blame Scorcese for trying.""Last Temptation"" has weaknesses. Keitel's Brooklyn accent and wild red wig are distractions. The weirdness of a half-resurrected Lazarus - a walking gospel-era zombie -- is true to the book, but bizarre when brought to the screen.The controversial scene, in which Christ and Mary Magdalene consummate their marriage is disturbing. I squirmed inwardly while watching Christ ""getting it on"" with Mary Magdalene. Yet the scene is meant as a satanic fantasy engineered to lure Christ from his mission. So, I don't understand the fuss. It's not as if (as per ""The Da Vinci Code"") that Scorcese or Kazantzakis were claiming that Christ and Mary Magdalene were really married.Though I wouldn't pick the film to show to the average Sunday school class, the film adds important components to a composite of Christ gleaned from the many movies about his life. It shows his compassion, his manliness, and proposes possible solutions to his hidden life and psychology. Three cheers for Scorcese's devotion to Jesus and for wrestling with important questions about his humanity.",4,A flawed but loving depiction,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,3626,"['Willem', 'Dafoe', 'playing', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'playing', 'Judas', 'Jesus', 'Judas', 'conspiring', 'have', 'Jesus', 'crucified', 'Jesus', 'getting', 'free', 'pass', 'Cross', 'marrying', 'having', 'family', 'Preposterous', 'casting', 'plot', 'elements', 'sound', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'very', 'close', 'making', 'work.Scorcese', 'more', 'less', 'faithfully', 'Nikos', 'Kazantzakis', 'controversial', 'novel', 'big', 'screen', 'Jesus', 'tortured', 'young', 'man', 'best', 'nightmares', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'crucifixion', 'Romans', 'crucify', 'fellow', 'Jews', 'dismay', 'opprobrium', 'townsfolk', 'Sensing', 'full', 'sin', 'Essene-like', 'desert', 'monastery', 'Finally', 'accept', 'destiny', 'Savior', 'gruesome', 'end', 'way', 'more', 'less', 'Jesus', 'Gospels', 'Satan', 'final', 'snare', 'Jesus', 'Jesus', 'suffers', 'Cross', 'Satan', 'guise', 'angelic', 'child', 'scenes', 'how', 'pleasant', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'turned', 'down', 'death', 'Cross', 'normal', 'life', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'children', 'easy', 'old', 'age', 'agony', 'pain.Conservatives', 'film', 'One', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'actually', 'had', 'back', 'shelf', 'piece', 'smut', 'see', 'much', 'heart', 'sometimes', 'literally', 'One', 'scene', 'wrenched', 'Scorcese', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'childhood', 'Jesus', 'pulling', 'still', 'beating', 'heart', 'body', 'allusion', 'Sacred', 'Heart', 'devotion', 'Childhood', 'allusions', 'aside', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'work', 'deep', 'feeling', 'faith', 'good', 'doctrine', 'test', 'nightmare-tormented', 'Jesus', 'one', 'thing', 'Jesus', 'who', 'being', 'full', 'sin', 'quite', 'guess', 'still', 'find', 'official', 'Church', 'teaching', 'Christ', 'sinlessness', 'compelling', 'Still', 'Scorcese', 'attempt', 'depict', 'Christ', 'humanity', 'impressive.Scorcese', 'predates', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'more', 'success', 'IMHO', 'trying', 'bring', 'historical', 'verisimilitude', 'Crucifixion', 'scene', '1968', 'bones', 'crucifixion', 'victim', 'were', 'unearthed', 'Jerusalem', 'nail', 'being', 'pounded', 'sides', 'ankles', 'not', 'top', 'feet', 'usually', 'depicted', 'Scholarly', 'conjecture', 'was', 'victim', 'legs', 'were', 'twisted', 'sideways', 'allowing', 'ankles', 'be', 'nailed', 'front', 'cross', 'forced', 'victim', 'body', 'weird', 'almost', 'seated', 'posture', 'Scorcese', 'posture', 'crucifixion', 'scene', 'though', 'oddly', 'only', 'Jesus', 'More', 'recent', 'studies', 'suggest', 'ankle-nailed', 'feet', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pounded', 'sides', 'not', 'front', 'cross.In', 'event', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Scorcese', 'trying', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'weaknesses', 'Keitel', 'Brooklyn', 'accent', 'wild', 'red', 'wig', 'are', 'distractions', 'weirdness', 'half-resurrected', 'Lazarus', 'walking', 'gospel-era', 'zombie', 'true', 'book', 'bizarre', 'when', 'brought', 'screen.The', 'controversial', 'scene', 'Christ', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'consummate', 'marriage', 'disturbing', 'squirmed', 'inwardly', 'watching', 'Christ', 'getting', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'scene', 'meant', 'satanic', 'fantasy', 'engineered', 'lure', 'Christ', 'mission', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'fuss', 'not', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'Scorcese', 'Kazantzakis', 'were', 'claiming', 'Christ', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'were', 'really', 'married.Though', 'would', ""n't"", 'pick', 'film', 'show', 'average', 'Sunday', 'school', 'class', 'film', 'important', 'components', 'composite', 'Christ', 'gleaned', 'many', 'movies', 'life', 'compassion', 'manliness', 'possible', 'solutions', 'hidden', 'life', 'psychology', 'Three', 'cheers', 'Scorcese', 'devotion', 'Jesus', 'wrestling', 'important', 'questions', 'humanity']",N/A

As the film started, there were a couple notes that put things into perspective.  The first one was from the author of the book on which this movie is based.  He basically says that he was intrigued by the dual nature of Christ (being of man and of God).  The second note mentions that the movie is not based on the Gospels.  This should have taken care of all controversy.For the most part, I did not have a problem with the movie.  Willem Dafoe plays Jesus who is a carpenter who is plagued with voices.  He does not see these as a gift, and there is no mention that he is the son of God.  Thus begins his journey to discover his true identity.  For the most part, this is from events covered in the New Testament.  There are some interpretations added to help the flow and to emphasize his human nature.  Nothing too bad.  He does perform miracles.In the film, the last temptation takes place during the crucifixion and takes up almost a fifth of the movie.  Putting the incidentals aside, he is basically tempted with a regular, happy human life.  I don't see this as much of a temptation as a vision, but that could be open to interpretation.I would recommend seeing this film with the caveat that it is not based solely on the Gospels, but it is based on a work of fiction.",4,Not from the Gospels,1029110400,"08 12, 2002",2002,1390,"['remembering', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'wondered', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'controversial', 'enjoy', 'film', 'started', 'were', 'couple', 'put', 'things', 'perspective', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'author', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'basically', 'was', 'intrigued', 'dual', 'nature', 'Christ', 'being', 'man', 'God', 'second', 'note', 'mentions', 'movie', 'not', 'based', 'Gospels', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'care', 'controversy.For', 'most', 'part', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'movie', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Jesus', 'who', 'carpenter', 'who', 'plagued', 'voices', 'not', 'see', 'gift', 'mention', 'son', 'God', 'Thus', 'journey', 'discover', 'true', 'identity', 'most', 'part', 'events', 'covered', 'New', 'Testament', 'are', 'interpretations', 'added', 'help', 'flow', 'emphasize', 'human', 'nature', 'Nothing', 'too', 'bad', 'perform', 'miracles.In', 'film', 'last', 'temptation', 'place', 'crucifixion', 'up', 'almost', 'fifth', 'movie', 'Putting', 'incidentals', 'aside', 'basically', 'tempted', 'regular', 'happy', 'human', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'temptation', 'vision', 'could', 'be', 'open', 'interpretation.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'film', 'caveat', 'not', 'based', 'solely', 'Gospels', 'based', 'work', 'fiction']",N/A

Most cinematic depictions of Christ show a perfect being, a one-dimensional person who is overly self confident and almost egotistical. The Last Temptation of Christ is totally different. It was banned by intolerant Christians who didn't even see it because they have conflicting viewpoints, which is one hell of a paradox. I use to say that Christ was described as a demi-god in the Bible because He is half-man and half-god, but I was told that He is really all-man and all-god. If the latter thesis is correct, than he most have all the perfections of god as well as all the faults of man.In the movie, Jesus is not perfect. He sins, or at least, He confesses sins. He is haunted by visions and sounds almost to where He goes on the brink of insanity. He is tempted by Satan over and over again into thinking that he is just a man. When He cures a person of blindness, He does not smile; he frowns in pain because for every man he cures, he knows it brings him closer to the cross.The characterization in this movie is excellent. This script is Schrader's best, although it was rewritten. I thought Willem Defoe was spell binding as Jesus Christ. Some people will say that he wasn't enough like Jesus, but you do have to realize that this is probably the hardest character to play and I think that Defoe did the best job that anyone could have done at playing Christ. Harvey Keitel did an equally excellent job at playing Judas, Jesus' best friend, who eventually betrays Him so the world can be saved. This may be Keitel's best performance (if not, it is one of the three). Barbara Hershey was also a great supporting roll as Mary Magdalene. Scorsese's direction wasn't bad at all. And the movie leads you to the most haunting portrayal of the crucifixion in cinematic history.This movie is certainly not for everyone. Many people with very strong religious convictions will see this movie as offensive, simply because Christ is portrayed a frightened man who sees his fate as a bourdon through 'half' of the film, and I implicate the word 'half' for a reason. When you watch this, you just might have to wonder (I know I did), what will be the last temptation of Christ?  You cannot do the film justice if you don't watch the whole film.You may be offended throughout the entire film, but it all comes together in the end and all is well.

182462,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,1559409037,J from NY,"[3, 5]","Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is, without a doubt, one of the best films I've had the privilege of viewing.  And I'm not easily impressed, particularly when it comes to cinematic depictions of Jesus Christ.Far superior to the sadomaschistic and anti-semitic ""Passion"", Scorsese adapts Kanzatzakis' brilliant novel of the struggle between the flesh and spirit, desire and selflessness, man and God, into an appropriately unconventional take on the struggle of Christ in his quest to redeem humanity.  There is not one scene in this movie that is not permeated with a sense of titanic events taking place sometimes quietly, sometimes loudly in that obscure place in the Middle East we now call the Holy Land. Willem Dafoe turns in the best performance of his career as that very well known individual known as Jesus--but not as some starry eyed plastic deity floating all over the place, preaching solemnly, getting crucified, and then ascending into heaven (or a grisly, emaciated figure gnashing his teeth as buckets of blood are poured on by Mel Gibson); this Jesus is human and divine, with a personality at once timid and fierce, tough as nails (no pun intended) and achingly weak.  He is the paradox of humanity made flesh.The movie begins as the novel did: Christ is a young man who seems a demented traitor to his fellow Jews.  The opening scene has Judas (played hilariously well by Harvey Keitel) shoving Jesus around and calling him a traitor to his own people for building crosses, thereby aiding the Romans with their very frequent crucifixions.  Jesus, like all of us, finds the right way (in his case the salvation of humanity, execution and death) too hard and viciously rebels against his destiny.  He wants to marry Magdalene ([played by an extremely hot Barbara Hershey) and live an ordinary life.  He cannot.  Until he accepts who he is, the world is spitting on him and abusing him; parts of the film look a like a travelogue of hell seen through the eyes of Dafoe's Christ.And when he accept who he is, they do the same thing with even more enthusiasm.A heavy element of suffering is present in this movie as in all of Scorsese's work; here, however, the suffering is to a higher purpose--it is only if we can bear enough to reach the purpose behind it which is self realization and truth no matter what the cost.  The earth shaking energy of the New Testament is realized here as in no other movie.  You can feel the pulsing of divine heat and revolutionary fervor behind Christ's every footstep.  The depiction of the Forty Days and Forty Nights is breathtaking.  The hallucinations Christ has on the cross are just that, hallucinations, and if you take offense, consider yourself a fanatic.  It leads to one of the most inspiring sequences I have ever seen in the history of film.While this based on a novel rather than the Gospels (all you nutcase fundamentalists keep that in mind), I still consider this the best movie ever made about Jesus Christ.",5,"""No, I struggle.

182463,A3IH2L4B5VOA59,1559409037,"J. Houzet ""wozamoya""","[4, 5]","I remember hearing about Nikos Kazantzakis' controversial novel back before it was made into a movie. My uncle had a copy of the book (he often reviewed stuff to ascertain its worthiness) and lamented its distortion of the gospel story. Years later, the controversy was renewed with Scorsese's film version which was banned in my home country of South Africa and probably many others.I eventually got to see the movie on BBC while living in London (the Brits will show almost anything on regular TV) and was surprised to discover how much I enjoyed the movie and how it made me appreciate Jesus even more, not think less of him.I saw a documentary on the reaction to the movie some time after that. There were scenes in New York of large crowds (mostly Catholic) protesting the premier and then it switched to Scorsese looking forlorn in his hotel room, perplexed at the backlash to his film. But like other reviewers have pointed out, artists enjoy a bit of controversy and I'm sure Scorsese got a lot of mileage out of this among Hollywood cultural elites.Nonetheless, it seems neither Kazantzakis nor Scorsese wanted to say: THIS is the real Jesus. The disclaimer at the beginning of the movie (from Kazantzakis' book, incidentally) says that the story represents Kazantzakis' personal faith struggle in trying to understand the divine, especially in the incarnation of Christ.Thus Kazantzakis' (and Scorsese's) Jesus comes across more human than divine, less sure of himself and almost schizophrenic and delusional in his conversations with a God who invades his mind and ""tortures"" him.Some of the things I appreciate about the movie are: the irony of Jesus' work as a carpenter - making crosses for the Romans; the humanity and bickering of the apostles (which is what they were like, just read the Gospels closely); the fact that Scorsese's Jesus IS a miracle worker - driving out demons, raising the dead; the supremacy of God (the devil appears in various guises to tempt Jesus with parlor tricks, but God just makes things happen!); the realism and emotion of the crucifixion scene; and the satisfying ending. Oh, and the soundtrack is great too - I bought it even before I saw the movie.The main objection to the story seems to be that Kazantzakis' Jesus succumbs to temptation - to come down from the cross and live a normal life with wife and kids. But again, this is the author's ""what if?"", not an attempted revision of the gospel story (though the Gnostic writings he used as sources certainly did try to re-make Jesus in their own image, mostly to excuse their own duality of spirituality and debauchery).Some of the flaws in this movie which seem to be based on ignorance rather than artistic intent are to do with Mary Magdalene. Scorsese (and I assume Kazantzakis) go with the traditional theory that Magdalene was a prostitute. But neither Matthew, Mark, Luke or John say that. What they do say is that Jesus delivered her from seven demons. From what we know of demon possession in the Gospels, these were people with no control of their faculties, who harmed themselves and had enormous strength. You think you could have a good time with a demon-possessed person? I think not.Another flaw was the character of Judas. I expected that the Jesus in the movie would be less than true to the Gospels, but what was up with making Judas his best buddy? It rung hollow. Harvey Keitel's portrayal of Judas left a lot to be desired as well. He comes off as a Goodfella in every movie he does and here he was the Jerusalem mafia, horribly anachronistic. It could be amusing if Scorsese wasn't trying to be serious.But the rest of the major players were well cast, with Willem Dafoe being believable as a conflicted Jesus and Barbara Hershey doing well as the sinful woman who becomes a disciple. I especially liked the old character actor (I forget his name) who plays the apostle Paul and his encounter with Jesus. He does an excellent job as a man transformed from murderous rogue into passionate missionary.",4,"Startling, intense, helpful",1041897600,"01 7, 2003",2003,4023,"['remember', 'hearing', 'Nikos', 'Kazantzakis', 'controversial', 'novel', 'back', 'was', 'made', 'movie', 'uncle', 'had', 'copy', 'book', 'often', 'reviewed', 'stuff', 'ascertain', 'worthiness', 'lamented', 'distortion', 'gospel', 'story', 'Years', 'later', 'controversy', 'was', 'renewed', 'Scorsese', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'banned', 'home', 'country', 'South', 'Africa', 'probably', 'many', 'others.I', 'eventually', 'got', 'see', 'movie', 'BBC', 'living', 'London', 'Brits', 'will', 'show', 'almost', 'anything', 'regular', 'TV', 'was', 'surprised', 'discover', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'how', 'made', 'appreciate', 'Jesus', 'even', 'more', 'not', 'think', 'less', 'him.I', 'saw', 'documentary', 'reaction', 'movie', 'time', 'were', 'scenes', 'New', 'York', 'large', 'crowds', 'mostly', 'Catholic', 'protesting', 'premier', 'then', 'switched', 'Scorsese', 'looking', 'forlorn', 'hotel', 'room', 'perplexed', 'backlash', 'film', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'enjoy', 'bit', 'controversy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Scorsese', 'got', 'lot', 'mileage', 'Hollywood', 'cultural', 'elites.Nonetheless', 'Kazantzakis', 'Scorsese', 'wanted', 'say', 'THIS', 'real', 'Jesus', 'disclaimer', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Kazantzakis', 'book', 'incidentally', 'story', 'Kazantzakis', 'personal', 'faith', 'struggle', 'trying', 'understand', 'divine', 'especially', 'incarnation', 'Christ.Thus', 'Kazantzakis', 'Scorsese', 'Jesus', 'more', 'human', 'divine', 'less', 'sure', 'almost', 'schizophrenic', 'delusional', 'conversations', 'God', 'who', 'mind', 'tortures', 'him.Some', 'things', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'are', 'irony', 'Jesus', 'work', 'carpenter', 'making', 'crosses', 'Romans', 'humanity', 'bickering', 'apostles', 'what', 'were', 'like', 'just', 'read', 'Gospels', 'closely', 'fact', 'Scorsese', 'Jesus', 'miracle', 'worker', 'driving', 'out', 'demons', 'raising', 'dead', 'supremacy', 'God', 'devil', 'various', 'guises', 'tempt', 'Jesus', 'parlor', 'tricks', 'God', 'just', 'things', 'happen', 'realism', 'emotion', 'crucifixion', 'scene', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'Oh', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'too', 'bought', 'even', 'saw', 'movie.The', 'main', 'objection', 'story', 'be', 'Kazantzakis', 'Jesus', 'succumbs', 'temptation', 'come', 'down', 'cross', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'wife', 'kids', 'again', 'author', 'what', 'not', 'attempted', 'revision', 'gospel', 'story', 'Gnostic', 'writings', 'used', 'sources', 'certainly', 'did', 'try', 're-make', 'Jesus', 'own', 'image', 'mostly', 'excuse', 'own', 'duality', 'spirituality', 'debauchery', '.Some', 'flaws', 'movie', 'seem', 'be', 'based', 'ignorance', 'rather', 'artistic', 'intent', 'are', 'do', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'Scorsese', 'assume', 'Kazantzakis', 'go', 'traditional', 'theory', 'Magdalene', 'was', 'prostitute', 'Matthew', 'Mark', 'Luke', 'John', 'say', 'What', 'do', 'say', 'Jesus', 'delivered', 'seven', 'demons', 'what', 'know', 'demon', 'possession', 'Gospels', 'were', 'people', 'control', 'faculties', 'who', 'harmed', 'had', 'enormous', 'strength', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'demon-possessed', 'person', 'think', 'not.Another', 'flaw', 'was', 'character', 'Judas', 'expected', 'Jesus', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'true', 'Gospels', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'making', 'Judas', 'best', 'buddy', 'rung', 'hollow', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'portrayal', 'Judas', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'as', 'well', 'off', 'Goodfella', 'movie', 'here', 'was', 'Jerusalem', 'mafia', 'horribly', 'anachronistic', 'could', 'be', 'amusing', 'Scorsese', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'serious.But', 'rest', 'major', 'players', 'were', 'well', 'cast', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'being', 'believable', 'conflicted', 'Jesus', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'doing', 'well', 'sinful', 'woman', 'who', 'disciple', 'especially', 'liked', 'old', 'character', 'actor', 'forget', 'name', 'who', 'apostle', 'Paul', 'encounter', 'Jesus', 'excellent', 'job', 'man', 'transformed', 'murderous', 'rogue', 'passionate', 'missionary']",N/A

This film is not at all blasphemous. When it shows Jesus fathering children and living a nice (but short) life with Mary Magdalene, it is showing the devil's last chance to take Christ's soul and Jesus resisting. It's also like a game, right before his death. This is just exploring the many possibilities of being human, don't be mistaken Jesus was GOD's only Son, but he was put here as a human. He was put here to feel the pain of man, feel many of our everyday pains, and be exposed to sin. So with that, this movie is really a milestone in cinema. I think people took this film the wrong way, it was like a spiritual journey of all the pain that Christ suffered long before he was put on the cross, but rather when his Father was speaking to him. This film is thought-provoking, brilliant and most of all --- well acted. The Criterion Collection did a fabulous job of cleaning up the picture as well as the sound.

Logically there is the question whether this &quot;Jesus&quot; portrayed in the novel and now on the film can save humankind in any respect.The movie is breathtaking in much of its scenary and look.  Big huge Hollywood sets are left out instead for a more authentic look.  This is a plus and it makes one feel as if they are there instead of watching a play at the local theater.  The casting is a bit distracting.  Harvey Keitel is not a very good Judas.  His accent is a big burden.  David Bowie is even a worse Pilate.  William Defoe on the other hand is tremendous in fulfilling his role as this reinterpreted Jesus. At times however, the actors are a little too much 20th century.  After all, the stage is set at 2000 years ago.The crucifying of Christ is one of the most passioned in film history and Martin probably would not have offended as many people if he had of left out certian scenes while Christ is being tempted by Satan.

Criticisms that it doesn't stick to the Bible are therefore irrelevant.  Likewise, the Gospels themselves have long been recognised by Biblical scholars as having been written long after the event by people who couldn't possibly have been there at the time, which in turn rules out Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ' as being in any way more 'authentic' than the source of this movie.  Kazantzakis' novel, like the Gospels themselves, are imaginative reconstructions of dubiously historical events, dubious in that by far the most detailed sources for the life and career of Jesus of Nazareth come from people who followed him years after his death.  (Check out your copy of 'The DaVinci Code' for background info on them, or better yet, read them, in the form of not just the New Testament but also the Apocryphal Gospels.  The latter have been in print for decades.)Having said all that, there are very very few movies about Jesus, or that even touch on the story of his life, that are at all watchable.  The classic-era Hollywood epics such as 'King of Kings' and 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' are not amongst them.  For my money, there are only three movies that are at least kind of about Jesus that are genuinely great. One is Pasolini's 'The Gospel According to Matthew', the only film ever to have been given awards by both the Vatican and the Italian Communist Party, because it effectively conveys the burning intensity of Matthew's take on Jesus.  The second is 'Monty Python's Life of Brian', in which Jesus only appears for about thirty seconds in the opening scene, but which brutally and hilariously deconstructs religious hysteria.  And the last, so far, is this one, in which Jesus is just a guy who has been visited by God, and who would far rather lay the burden down.Why religious groups hate this film is a mystery to me.  Surely a film that focuses on the extent and painfulness of Jesus' self-sacrifice ought to be a...well, a godsend.  But apparently most church groups would rather watch Mel Gibson's witless, ignorant and depressing snuff movie, a film accurately characterised by the (firmly Catholic) Kevin Smith as a movie in which people spend two hours kicking the c**p out of the Messiah.  The Catholic Scorsese, the ex-Calvinist Schrader and the presumably agnostic Dafoe made, between them, one of the most moving and most painful portrayals of Jesus ever to make celluloid, and all the church could do was bitch about it.It's not the best movie any of these people have ever made, but it's still brilliant.

182475,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,1559409037,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[8, 12]","The Last Temptation of Christ was first a book published by Nikos Kazantzakis in 1953. Martin Scorsese became quite a fan of the story, and set about to make an accurate version of the *book*. Martin clearly states this aim at the beginning of the movie. So it's critical to remember when watching the movie that this is in no way a ""reenactment of the Bible"". It is clearly a telling of an imaginary story written by Kazantzakis.That all being said, the story of course involves figures that are central in a religion that millions of people believe in. So it's no surprise that many people get upset when the story changes what happened. It would be like someone growing up loving the Lord of the Rings series - and then seeing a book that has the elven race actually composed of outer space beings tormenting the Middle Earthers for fun. The objection is not only that the twisting is incorrect - but also that those who read the twisted story might then believe it is accurate. For better or for worse, there is certainly a block of people out there that form their opinions of reality based on movies they watch.So, what is the ""twisting"" done in The Last Temptation of Christ? The basic story is this. Jesus - Willem Dafoe - is a carpenter who makes crosses and who is tormented by voices. He resists his calling for a while, but finally accepts that he's the son of God. He goes into the desert and is tempted by Satan, but gets through it. His apostles follow him, he's put on the cross, and he's tempted one last time. He's tempted to escape off the cross, settle down with Mary and live a happy life with kids. In the end he resists, dies, and we are saved.If just this story was put on paper and film, I don't think Christians would be TOO upset. We know from the Bible that Jesus was tempted, we know he overcame those temptations. He wasn't ""perfect"". He didn't go directly from embryo to crucifixion without any doubt at all. He was human, which is why his sacrifice was so important. He lived as one of us, among us, and being one of us, he died for us. Thus says the Bible. At its core, that is what the movie says.In fact, the movie says that far more ""authentically"" than any previous movie. It in essence paved the way for The Passion of the Christ. Up until now, Christ movies involved very sanitized worlds full of blonde haired beauties and charismatic, clean, well groomed men. Scorsese did an incredible job researching exactly how people lived, what they wore, how crucifixion actually looked, and so on. Whatever is ""said"" during the movie, the environment we see is one of the first that is well done.You also get a real sense of the agonies and tortures that Christ went through. It wasn't a happy life, once he set on his mission. He was laughed at, scorned, and in the end, truly beaten. Crucifixion was an agonizing death. For believers, those scenes remind you just what Christ went through to help save the rest of us.OK, so those are the ""beneficial"" parts of the movie. Let's now look at the ""harmful"" parts of the movie, in the sense that they lodge inaccurate ideas in the minds of viewers who aren't very good at distinguising movie reenactments of fictional books and actual historical documentaries.First, a personal pet peeve of mine, they made Mary a prostitute. We've already had the Vatican clear up, officially, that misunderstanding. Mary was NEVER documented as a prostitute. The correlation was a mistake made by a single pope many centuries ago. The official declaration that Mary was not a prostitute was in 1969, after the book was written but before the movie was made. So maybe Martin felt he had to keep true to the book even though it was perpetuating a harmful myth. The scenes involving Mary seem to have been sensationalized a bit, too, and not very historically accurate.Next, let's all agree first that the whole last third of the movie is in fact a DREAM SEQUENCE - it's when Jesus is being tempted by Satan to abandon his death. It's not real, it's a dream. Satan is notorious for coming up with wild temptations and this one is no exception. In it, Jesus first sleeps with Mary. She promptly dies. So Jesus hooks up with Mary, Lazarus' sister. Then he also sleeps with that Mary's sister! Each time, Satan (in the guise of an innocent, angelic girl) tells Jesus ""Don't worry, all women are the same, so you're just loving Mary over and over again here"".My issue here isn't the generic thought that Jesus was tempted with sex. Remember, we know Jesus was tempted many times. Undoubtedly along with power, wealth, etc. he was tempted with women. It's a standard temptation. That being said, I didn't see Jesus ""resisting"" that temptation very hard!! It almost came across as the Star Trek episode where Captain Picard ""lives"" an entire life with an alien race, marrying, having kids, and reaching old age, all in a sort of dream sequence. Captain Picard resisted at first, trying to get back to his ship. Jesus didn't resist at all! He went quite willingly with the girl, and was *furious* when Mary died. But then the girl says ""don't worry, go sleep with Mary #2"" and Jesus says ""Oh, ok!"". Then when happily partnered with Mary #2 he gets a ""come hither"" from the sister, he barely blinks before going off with her. He reaches old age and is going to die happily. It's only when Judas storms in, angry at Jesus for abandoning them, and pointing out that the ""guardian angel"" is actually Satan, that Jesus decides he might as well die on the cross. Heck, he's led his good life, had lots of kids, had 3 women, and is going to die anyway. Why not die on the cross.So my issue here is that Jesus was offered the long life with wife and child. He could have looked at that life seriously, and then said, ""No, I will not take that path, I will give up my life now, willingly."" Instead he DID take that path - he didn't know this was a dream at the time, remember - and he lived it ALL. He got his snuggly nights, his long days with his kids, his wine, his affairs, his slow path into old age. And even then he was happy. It was only Judas' appearance and anger that finally made him choose to spend his final ""4 hours"" on the cross.So I really don't see Jesus as having resisted the last temptation. In a way he got his cake and ate it too. Not only did he eat it (i.e. have wife and child) but he went a bit wild there. If he'd been presented with an image of Mary as his wife while sitting in the circle-of-torment, had to watch her fall in love with another man, go off and have kids and be very happy, that would have been a temptation to resist. He could have been tormented and teetering on the edge of abandoning his messiah life. But to have him on the cross and choose TO marry her, to sleep around and have lots of kids and have a long life - even threatening to his apostles that he'd expose them for frauds because he was still alive - didn't seem like he resisted at all.There are other random nits to pick in the movie, if you seek for them. Some of the accents were a bit odd, for example. But I really find those balanced out by some quite good performances. David Bowie as Pilate really did well, showing that he is trying to run his area efficiently and is frustrated by the locals who just won't keep calm. I also liked the portrayal of Judas as a loyal member of the troupe who is well trusted by Jesus and who ""betrays"" Jesus with his blessing. Remember, most Christians believe Jesus *had* to die for us all to be saved. Jesus knew he'd die, and he accepted it. It makes sense that he talked to Judas about this. It was Judas' role to perform that action, a necessary role.In general, I think it's a valuable movie for anybody to watch, if they wish to learn more about religion. Yes, it's important to watch it and to know it's a reenactment of a fictional book. It's also important, during the dream sequence, to remember it is NOT REAL in any sense at all. It's a dream, a temptation. And finally, it's important to compare this movie to other sources, to get a sense of what parts are accurate and how they fit into the known story of the Biblical times. If you're not religious, it helps you understand more where religious people are ""coming from"" on some of these issues. If you are religious, there are certainly enough scenes in here (the crucifixion scene, for example) that are quite moving.",4,A Good Reenactment of a Fictional Book,1135641600,"12 27,

Basically a different take on the ""Greatest Story Ever Told""Drives home the point of why Jesus had to die on the cross, why God had to make the sacrifice that HE asked Abraham to do, and what the New Testament actually means to mankind.William Dafoe came across at first (to me) like he was overacting the scenes where he was ""tortured"" by God, and I questioned the choice of him to play the Jesus... but he really came into the role of the Lord in a way no other person has (and I have have watched TONS of bible stories). He was literally perfect in this role, and I feel like he is a true believer in real life.I think this has all the suffering that Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" film has without getting all dark vibe, grim scenery and torture-porn feel. Plus the acting is a million times better.Here is the real kicker - I absolutely LOVE that Judas's role was changed and he was chosen as the catalyst for the sacrifice, and that  he and Jesus were fully aware of the role he was to play. I am speechless actually and am stoked to see Judas portrayed as the ""good guy"".Also, his damning of Jesus at the end for not dying and playing his part was STUNNING (wow, just wow).I love this movie, Could it have been better? Yes. (John the baptist part was questionable) But the acting, the scenery, the music and the message was pure Christian TRUTH expressed lovingly.I would recommend this to anyone that wants to watch a well made, well acted movie about biblical times presented in a more ""modern"" way, and to anyone that is a searching for a deeper understanding of what Christianity is at it's core.Amazing, great film.",4,Stunning take on the sacrifice and what it means to man,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,2051,"['Thank', 'YOU', 'Lord', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'giving', 'life', 'finally', 'putting', 'up', 'shutting', 'up', 'sacrificing', 'own', 'begotten', 'flesh', 'so', 'may', 'have', 'personal', 'relationship', 'YOU', '.Difficult', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'intense', 'personally', 'emotional', 'take', 'final', 'temptation', 'Christ', 'as', 'well', 'contemplation', 'last', 'words', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'My', 'GOD', 'My', 'GOD', 'why', 'have', 'forsaken', 'Basically', 'different', 'take', 'Greatest', 'Story', 'Ever', 'Told', 'home', 'point', 'why', 'Jesus', 'had', 'die', 'cross', 'why', 'God', 'had', 'make', 'sacrifice', 'HE', 'asked', 'Abraham', 'do', 'what', 'New', 'Testament', 'actually', 'mankind.William', 'Dafoe', 'came', 'first', 'was', 'overacting', 'scenes', 'where', 'was', 'tortured', 'God', 'questioned', 'choice', 'play', 'Jesus', 'really', 'came', 'role', 'Lord', 'way', 'other', 'person', 'have', 'have', 'watched', 'TONS', 'bible', 'stories', 'was', 'literally', 'perfect', 'role', 'feel', 'true', 'believer', 'real', 'life.I', 'think', 'suffering', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'film', 'getting', 'dark', 'vibe', 'grim', 'scenery', 'torture-porn', 'feel', 'acting', 'million', 'times', 'better.Here', 'real', 'kicker', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'Judas', 'role', 'was', 'changed', 'was', 'chosen', 'catalyst', 'sacrifice', 'Jesus', 'were', 'fully', 'aware', 'role', 'was', 'play', 'am', 'speechless', 'actually', 'am', 'stoked', 'see', 'Judas', 'good', 'guy', '.Also', 'damning', 'Jesus', 'end', 'not', 'dying', 'playing', 'part', 'was', 'STUNNING', 'wow', 'just', 'wow', 'love', 'movie', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Yes', 'John', 'baptist', 'part', 'was', 'questionable', 'acting', 'scenery', 'music', 'message', 'was', 'pure', 'Christian', 'TRUTH', 'expressed', 'lovingly.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'watch', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'acted', 'movie', 'biblical', 'times', 'presented', 'more', 'modern', 'way', 'anyone', 'searching', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'what', 'Christianity', 'core.Amazing', 'great', 'film']",N/A

182480,A2VH0UT5EQFB6P,1559409037,Loveguitar,"[3, 5]","This movie is just purely fantasy about what might of, could of, or should of happened back then, but all the while making a mild attempt to be careful not to overly offend Christians. If they got offended then that's their problem.  But I guess seeing Christ assembling crosses and then helping to nail Jews to them would be rather offensive to most Christians, or decent people in general.  Being an ex-Christian, I understand that the basis of Christianity is a heartfelt belief in the miraculous resurrection back to life after death of a specially sent ""god-man"" of virgin birth around 2,000 years ago, who is now called ""Christ"", and one they have put upon a pedestal and worship as a God and whom they say will only accept them into heaven after they beg him for forgiveness of their wicked and lost souls and acknowledge him as their eternal lord and master. And also that they must make incredible irritants of themselves proselytizing the ""good news!"" like I (and anyone else born in the free world) haven't heard it a hundred-thousand times already.  Yep, I can see a fairly interesting movie plot in all of that.I bought this movie as a birthday present for my husband since he asked specifically for it.  He's a Christian and believes in the virgin birth, miracle stuff, and resurrection business but I no longer do.  I watched the movie with him and while watching Jesus thrash around on the floor, rolling about in mental torture of some sort I kept thinking, ""It's too bad they didn't understand mental illness back then, especially schizophrenia"".  Even more so when he was all wild-eyed with a crazed look telling Judas that God was talking to him.But whether you believe the Christian story or not, it's a fairly entertaining movie although I really wished William Defoe had not played the part of Christ.  Even Harvey Keitel was weird as Judas.  Defoe just looked freaky with his huge gapped teeth and humongous mouth.  I suppose Jesus could have been even freakier looking but who knows......he may have not even existed.  But that's beside the point.  And the nitty-gritty of life back then was depicted as dry, dirty, ragged, rough, windy and with very little naturally occurring water (lakes, rivers, ponds, pools or even puddles) anywhere.  John the Baptist and his band of zealots were mucking about in a trickle of a stream.  It was similar to a spaghetti western in realism.  Maybe it was too dirty.  You could almost smell the stink in the air and I felt like swatting at flies some of the time.Christians can be happy that the movie ended in the traditional way with him being back, and suffering on the cross with the assumption that he will certainly be resurrected.  My heart did hurt for him when he was in the Garden of Gethsemene praying so hard and begging God to stop it all - that he didn't want to do it.  William Defoe did act out that scene very well - I felt compassion for the Jesus character.  Non-Christians can enjoy the movie too, but they may be a bit disappointed since he is fulfilling the Christian role given him.  The dialogue sounded rather stilted and forced - did they really talk like that back then?  So Bible-ish, and it wasn't even written then.I did like how sincere the devil seemed to be in the form of the angel child who helped Jesus down from his cross.  That was the only character who seemed real and believable.  But when his/her sham was revealed she/he turned into a big ole flaming geyser of sorts, said some devil junk and disappeared - I guess back to hell or maybe the White House, who knows, but it was a bit old and overdone.  And having Mary Magdalene suddenly drop dead when she was very happy and apparently healthy and ready to give birth any day made no sense.  The entire story was a little hard for me to swallow, but hubby really enjoyed it.  But we couldn't discuss it afterwards.

182484,A2R6RA8FRBS608,1559409037,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","The Last Temptation of Christ brings to film a fictionalized story about Christ in a book by Nikos Kazantzakis. Specifically, in this film we see what might have happened if Jesus had been forced to struggle between his desires to be a family man with a home versus being Jesus the Messiah who dies for people's sins and who represents so much to those of the Christian faith. The story is beautifully told--not that it's always easy to take; there are numerous scenes in this film that disqualify it from ""family"" viewing--and Willem Dafoe's acting performance as Jesus is as good as it gets. The cinematography is excellent and everyone, actors included, worked so hard to make sure that the choreography was just right for just the right effect. The plot moves along at a very good pace; and although it's almost three hours long not including the bonus features you shouldn't feel bored. On the other hand, however, if you are uncomfortable with the idea that Jesus might have had these human temptations in his life, you shouldn't get this one because that's Scorsese's message.Of course, we see many highlights of the story of Christ including people beginning to see him as the Messiah as he speaks, heals the sick, performs miracles, becomes furious when he discovers that people are doing business in the temple, partakes in the last supper when he knows he's going to be betrayed and his ultimate death on the cross. However, when Scorsese takes Nikos Kazantzakis's novel and essentially breathes life into it on film the fictionalized story is every bit as unforgettable. Dafoe deserves a millions stars for the giving one of the best performances I've ever seen on film; he portrays Jesus to perfection as he struggles with a desire to be a family man with a home versus a desire to shun romance with women and help the poor, preach the power of love and truly be the Messiah. Unfortunately, however, the important role of Judas was given to Harvey Keitel who manages brilliantly to rattle off many of his lines with a noticeable Brooklyn accent. Ouch! Barbara Hershey is outstanding as Mary Magdalene and Harry Dean Stanton is equally wonderful playing the roles of both Saul and Paul (with the role of Paul coming later in the film). Look also for a good performance by David Bowie as Pontius Pilate; and Juliette Caton does a flawless job as a guardian angel for Jesus even if she just might throw you a plot twist or two creating quite an effect at the very end of the film.I'd love to tell you more but I'd also hate to ruin it for you; this is one outstanding film and the fact that it is part of The Criterion Collection proves it's quite noteworthy. Moreover, others have added spoilers already so if I add too much more you'd be getting the same information several other reviewers already gave you. What I can do, however, is tell you about the bonus features on the DVD. You get some footage Martin Scorsese personally filmed when they were on location in Morocco although it's not always in perfect focus; an optional running commentary (from 1997) with Martin Scorsese, Willem Dafoe and Paul Schrader; a small print gallery called ""Scorsese's Visual Research;"" a featurette on costume designs; production and publicity stills and more! These are marvelous extras.The Last Temptation of Christ is an excellent film adaptation of a fictionalized story about Christ in a book by Nikos Kazantzakis. Scorsese and his cast and crew did a magnificent job with this project; my only relatively minor disappointment was Harvey Keitel in the role of Judas--he said some of his lines with a Brooklyn accent which sounded ridiculous.

To discuss this movie, however, one can't avoid the question of the controversy that to this day surrounds it. Fundamentalist Christians deemed the film blasphemous before they even saw it, due to its portrayal of Jesus as equally God and man. This idea, though, is firmly placed within the Bible and creates a three-dimensional character out of Jesus (as opposed to the two-dimensional Jesus in The Passion of the Christ). Here, Jesus is wholly divine and wholly man, confused and all-knowing. He is the ultimate paradox. Jesus's conquering of temptation and his triumph is inspiring. While Scorsese worked under a very limited budget (and it is obvious in many instances), the film is still a masterpiece, thanks in no small part to Peter Gabriel's mesmerizing score.

I liked the movie but what really made me give it a 5-star was after reading the book (see my review of ""Good Story...good characters""The Last Temptation Of ChristThe fourth time was the most enlightening and easiest to follow. I saw the movie about two weeks before I read the book then, again, about three weeks after the read. The other times I had a rough time following the characters and understanding Jesus' thoughts and dreams. The book was an enormous help since it is more detailed. Don't know where all the bad hype came from. I thought this was done very respectful. Barbara Hershey is top notch in her performance as Mary Magdalene and Willem Defoe really gets into the character. Even David Bowie has a part as Pontius Pilate. To me, it was better with the subtitles on since a lot of the voices are barely audible. The Criterion Collection did a great job with this film but I don't think the extras were very good. I would have liked to have seen the making of it and maybe interviewing the cast/director. I started watching the extra that Scorsese shot with his camera but it wasn't very interesting to me. The music by Peter Gabriel was eerie, magical and intense. Very good soundtrack. Harvey Keitel's portrayal of Judas was inline with the book. Even Harry Dean Stanton gives a performance as Saul/Paul. Lots of big actors in this movie. There is nudity in this film but I think it was done very discretely and with respect. One scene there are many nude people dancing around the river while John the Baptist is baptizing Jesus. When he does this a fast shot of the crowd shows the once naked women covering themselves. You can hardly notice it. There are many little things like this in the movie. Probably not a good movie to see with younger children around. Not just the nudity but the violence.

But even aside from this, I remember THE LAST  TEMPTATION OF CHRIST as the movie that restored my faith at a time when I  was in doubt. I had half-heartedly been confirmed as a Roman Catholic in  the late 1980s, though I always had trouble finding support in a church  that seemed to care more about politics (especially stupid anti-abortion  rants) than anything approaching spiritual comfort.  My low point came  during the Gulf War of 1991, when I was worried about my brother heading to  Kuwait to fight as part of the 82nd Airborne division.  I went to church  the week that the ground war began, hopinf to find some solace...and was  treated to an idiotic abortion sermon by the priest about how abortionists  are Nazis who want to murder babies and senior citizens (don't ask how that  came around), and how women becoming pregnant by rape should allow their  babies to be born so that the children would grow up to love Christ. That  was the last time I willingly set foot in a Roman Catholic church, and  after that I rented and watched THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST just for the  hell of it.  And to my amazemement, I found a spark of hope in this movie,  with its portrayal of Christ as a man with faults and doubts, so that by  the time of his final victory at the climax of the film, I felt appeased  and even happier...enough for me to seek a spiritual path that could make  me feel good about myself. Maybe that's the point that Christ himself was  making when he defied the established order in his time: forget the silly  religious politics and seek to discover the true &quot;spirit&quot; that  moves within us.  It certainly moves within this film.",5,A movie that restored my faith,940291200,"10 19, 1999",1999,2044,"['First', 'all', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'masterpiece', 'can', 'find', 'music', 'stores', 'title', 'quot', 'Passion', 'quot', 'haunting', 'eerie', 'mysterious', 'rhythmic', 'journey', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'music', 'ages', 'woven', 'together', 'muscial', 'fabric', 'permeates', 'way', 'few', 'other', 'musical', 'experiences', 'can', 'even', 'aside', 'remember', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'OF', 'CHRIST', 'movie', 'restored', 'faith', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'doubt', 'had', 'half-heartedly', 'been', 'confirmed', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'late', '1980s', 'always', 'had', 'trouble', 'finding', 'support', 'church', 'seemed', 'care', 'more', 'politics', 'especially', 'stupid', 'anti-abortion', 'rants', 'anything', 'approaching', 'spiritual', 'comfort', 'low', 'point', 'came', 'Gulf', 'War', '1991', 'when', 'was', 'worried', 'brother', 'heading', 'Kuwait', 'fight', 'part', '82nd', 'Airborne', 'division', 'went', 'church', 'week', 'ground', 'war', 'began', 'hopinf', 'find', 'solace', 'was', 'treated', 'idiotic', 'abortion', 'sermon', 'priest', 'how', 'abortionists', 'are', 'Nazis', 'who', 'want', 'murder', 'babies', 'senior', 'citizens', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'how', 'came', 'around', 'how', 'women', 'becoming', 'pregnant', 'rape', 'should', 'allow', 'babies', 'be', 'born', 'so', 'children', 'would', 'grow', 'up', 'love', 'Christ', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'willingly', 'set', 'foot', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'church', 'rented', 'watched', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'OF', 'CHRIST', 'just', 'hell', 'amazemement', 'found', 'spark', 'hope', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'Christ', 'man', 'faults', 'doubts', 'time', 'final', 'victory', 'climax', 'film', 'felt', 'appeased', 'even', 'happier', 'enough', 'seek', 'spiritual', 'path', 'could', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'Maybe', 'point', 'Christ', 'was', 'making', 'when', 'defied', 'established', 'order', 'time', 'forget', 'silly', 'religious', 'politics', 'seek', 'discover', 'true', 'quot', 'quot', 'certainly', 'film']",N/A

182494,A2PJSHMB83QYKX,1559409037,MoVwatcher20,"[4, 4]","With The Last Temptation of Christ, Scorsese creates a jaw-dropping character study that is every bit as polarizing and radical as its central figure. Drenched in controversy since its release in 1988, this film has never received the accolades that, in this viewer's mind, it truly deserves. It has been condemned as a blasphemous, anti-Christian and inaccurate retelling of the life of Christ. Well, to anyone who shares this opinion, either you are seriously lacking in brain cells or you have absolutely no concept of Scorsese or of filmmaking in general.First of all, this film is NOT trying to tell the life story of Jesus--at least not in the traditional sense. And while it does explore several key moments in Jesus' life (the sermon on the hill, the temptation in the desert, the last supper), as the opening title sequence states, this is really about Jesus' inner conflict between his spirituality and his human desires. It asks the question that I'm sure many of us, believers or not, have asked ourselves: what would have happened if Jesus had not gone to the cross and instead lived a human life? I know I have asked this question and I think of all the answers I've ever received, this film answers it the best.I think what I admired most about this film is that not only does it explore the character of Jesus but also some very important figures in his life, such as Judas and Peter. Judas especially is a character that has become synonymous with betrayal and evil, but what the film is clever to suggest is that Judas' betrayal of Jesus was necessary, even crucial in ensuring Jesus' goal. If Judas had not betrayed Jesus, then the crucifixion would never have happened and Jesus would never have brought salvation to the world, opened the gates of heaven, etc. etc. Also, Peter, who in today's world is regarded as a holy figure and symbol of love and devotion, is portrayed in this film as being kind of a sheep when you come right down to it. He fawns over Jesus and claims to love and respect him, but where Judas would go so far as to betray Jesus at his own request, Peter can't even be bothered to stay awake and keep Jesus company in his hour of despair.  Not to mention, in one of the most overlooked acts of cowardice to date, Peter pretends not to know Jesus after he has been publicly condemned. With these characters, the film takes the accepted view of biblical figures and reassesses them. It dares to question the true nature of these people and furthermore, makes us as viewers wonder what we would do in their scenarios. Would we follow someone's orders because we know it's the right thing to do (Judas) or would we do it just because we were asked to do it (Peter)?In the case of our protagonist, Jesus is portrayed by Willem Dafoe with great humanity and honesty. He is very much a man here, and as a man, he feels pain (both physically and emotionally), he feels lust, doubt and anger as anyone would when faced with half the level of responsibility that Jesus begins to understand that he possesses. He also is very troubled. He is not the all-knowing, all-wise, ""religious postcard"" (to quote Roger Ebert) version of Jesus that cinema has popularized. He is very uncertain about his role in life and is every bit as skeptical about his abilities as those around him. Even when he performs miracles (such as raising Lazarus from the dead) he's disturbed by them. He's able to do these things, but why? He has to act on faith alone and trust that the road he's on is the true way, without any kind of certainty or confirmation. So when he is ultimately tricked into believing that all of his beliefs were just delusions and that he has been following a false road, we, as an audience, can't judge him. After all, the film itself is very ambiguous as to whether Jesus is divine or not, and by this approach, our faith is tested just as much as Jesus'. However, this is why it's so easy to tell who, among the many people who say ""boo"" to this film have actually seen it. Because the film, contrary to what so many like to think, does not turn its nose up to the idea of faith, or religion for that matter. What it's trying to say is that even biblical figures like Jesus are subject to the uncertainty that comes with being human, but to keep faith through this uncertainty requires a great deal of strength.",5,A Misunderstood Classic,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,4348,"['Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ', 'Scorsese', 'jaw-dropping', 'character', 'study', 'bit', 'polarizing', 'radical', 'central', 'figure', 'Drenched', 'controversy', 'release', '1988', 'film', 'never', 'received', 'accolades', 'viewer', 'mind', 'truly', 'been', 'condemned', 'blasphemous', 'anti-Christian', 'inaccurate', 'retelling', 'life', 'Christ', 'Well', 'anyone', 'who', 'shares', 'opinion', 'are', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'brain', 'cells', 'have', 'absolutely', 'concept', 'Scorsese', 'filmmaking', 'general.First', 'film', 'NOT', 'trying', 'tell', 'life', 'story', 'Jesus', 'least', 'not', 'traditional', 'sense', 'explore', 'several', 'key', 'moments', 'Jesus', 'life', 'sermon', 'hill', 'temptation', 'desert', 'last', 'supper', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'states', 'really', 'Jesus', 'inner', 'conflict', 'spirituality', 'human', 'desires', 'question', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'believers', 'not', 'have', 'asked', 'ourselves', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'Jesus', 'had', 'not', 'gone', 'cross', 'instead', 'lived', 'human', 'life', 'know', 'have', 'asked', 'question', 'think', 'answers', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'received', 'film', 'best.I', 'think', 'what', 'admired', 'most', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'explore', 'character', 'Jesus', 'also', 'very', 'important', 'figures', 'life', 'such', 'Judas', 'Peter', 'Judas', 'especially', 'character', 'become', 'synonymous', 'betrayal', 'evil', 'what', 'film', 'clever', 'suggest', 'Judas', 'betrayal', 'Jesus', 'was', 'necessary', 'even', 'crucial', 'ensuring', 'Jesus', 'goal', 'Judas', 'had', 'not', 'betrayed', 'Jesus', 'then', 'crucifixion', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'Jesus', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'brought', 'salvation', 'world', 'opened', 'gates', 'heaven', 'etc', 'etc', 'Also', 'Peter', 'who', 'today', 'world', 'regarded', 'holy', 'figure', 'symbol', 'love', 'devotion', 'portrayed', 'film', 'being', 'kind', 'sheep', 'when', 'come', 'right', 'down', 'Jesus', 'claims', 'love', 'respect', 'where', 'Judas', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'betray', 'Jesus', 'own', 'request', 'Peter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'bothered', 'stay', 'awake', 'keep', 'Jesus', 'company', 'hour', 'despair', 'Not', 'mention', 'one', 'most', 'overlooked', 'acts', 'cowardice', 'date', 'Peter', 'not', 'know', 'Jesus', 'been', 'publicly', 'condemned', 'characters', 'film', 'accepted', 'view', 'biblical', 'figures', 'question', 'true', 'nature', 'people', 'furthermore', 'viewers', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'scenarios', 'Would', 'follow', 'someone', 'orders', 'know', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'Judas', 'would', 'do', 'just', 'were', 'asked', 'do', 'Peter', 'case', 'protagonist', 'Jesus', 'portrayed', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'great', 'humanity', 'honesty', 'very', 'much', 'man', 'here', 'man', 'pain', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'lust', 'doubt', 'anger', 'anyone', 'would', 'when', 'faced', 'level', 'responsibility', 'Jesus', 'understand', 'also', 'very', 'troubled', 'not', 'all-knowing', 'all-wise', 'religious', 'postcard', 'quote', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'version', 'Jesus', 'cinema', 'popularized', 'very', 'uncertain', 'role', 'life', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'abilities', 'Even', 'when', 'miracles', 'such', 'raising', 'Lazarus', 'dead', 'disturbed', 'able', 'do', 'things', 'why', 'act', 'faith', 'alone', 'trust', 'road', 'true', 'way', 'kind', 'certainty', 'confirmation', 'So', 'when', 'ultimately', 'tricked', 'believing', 'beliefs', 'were', 'just', 'delusions', 'been', 'following', 'false', 'road', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'film', 'very', 'ambiguous', 'Jesus', 'divine', 'not', 'approach', 'faith', 'tested', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Jesus', 'However', 'why', 'so', 'easy', 'tell', 'who', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'boo', 'film', 'have', 'actually', 'seen', 'film', 'contrary', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'think', 'not', 'turn', 'nose', 'idea', 'faith', 'religion', 'matter', 'What', 'trying', 'say', 'even', 'biblical', 'figures', 'Jesus', 'are', 'subject', 'uncertainty', 'being', 'human', 'keep', 'faith', 'uncertainty', 'great', 'deal', 'strength']",N/A

However, it's definitely important to remeber that Jesus was a man, and like any of us, had the same fears, temptations, and desires.Just as controversial (just for different reasons) as THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, Martin Scorsese's LAST TEMPTATION covers the same ground that everyone already knows about Jesus (played here by the one and only Willem Dafoe), but giving him the same human characteristics as Jesus posesses in Nikos Kazantzakasi's novel on which it is based. Ideed, this is the most human, most vunerable, most identifiable Jesus ever to be on film. It's such a shame that right wing fundamentalists in this country have been able to have such an influence on people who have never even seen the film (Right-wingers are notorius for this; they did it with FAHRENHEIT 9/11, and are planning to do it with THE DAVINCI CODE.)While I have no problem with Jesus being married and had children (can't wait for THE DAVINCI CODE to get into theaters), he is not in LAST TEMPTATION. The controversy surrounding the film stems from the fact that while Jesus is on the cross in this film, that IS his LAST TEMPTATION, along with just a normal life, and the promise of not having to die the most horrible death imaginable.The divinity of Christ in LAST TEMPTATION comes from the fact that virtually any other man would have gladly allowed himself to be removed from the cross by his guardian angel and life a normal life. Jesus makes the same choice, and many years later, realizes the cost of his choice, and begs God to send him back to the cross, to allow him to be the Messiah. He then realizes it's all taken place in his mind, and he has truly achieved divinty and become the Messiah in the final moments before his death.That's what the divinty of Christ means to me and that's what LAST TEMPTATION presents it as: offered the choice of all the joys and sorrows of simple humanity, Jesus instead took up his cross and died so that all mankind would see salvation. He succeded where anyone else would have failed.That's what it really means to be the divine Son of God. THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST exists to get this message across, and those who have truly heard and understood the teachings of Jesus will see this and recognize LAST TEMPTATION as the fanstatic work of cinematic and religious art that it is.",5,The other side of the Messiah,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2505,"['upcoming', 'release', 'THE', 'DAVINCI', 'CODE', 'recent', 'discovery', 'Gospel', 'according', 'Judas', 'perhaps', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'are', 'coming', 'terms', 'humanity', 'Jesus', 'However', 'definitely', 'important', 'remeber', 'Jesus', 'was', 'man', 'had', 'same', 'fears', 'temptations', 'desires.Just', 'controversial', 'just', 'different', 'reasons', 'PASSION', 'THE', 'CHRIST', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'same', 'ground', 'everyone', 'already', 'Jesus', 'played', 'here', 'one', 'only', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'giving', 'same', 'human', 'characteristics', 'Jesus', 'Nikos', 'Kazantzakasi', 'novel', 'based', 'Ideed', 'most', 'human', 'most', 'vunerable', 'most', 'identifiable', 'Jesus', 'ever', 'be', 'film', 'such', 'shame', 'right', 'wing', 'fundamentalists', 'country', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'have', 'such', 'influence', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'film', 'Right-wingers', 'are', 'notorius', 'did', 'FAHRENHEIT', '9/11', 'are', 'planning', 'do', 'THE', 'DAVINCI', 'CODE', 'have', 'problem', 'Jesus', 'being', 'married', 'had', 'children', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'THE', 'DAVINCI', 'CODE', 'get', 'theaters', 'not', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'film', 'fact', 'Jesus', 'cross', 'film', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'just', 'normal', 'life', 'promise', 'not', 'having', 'die', 'most', 'horrible', 'death', 'imaginable.The', 'divinity', 'Christ', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'fact', 'virtually', 'other', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'gladly', 'allowed', 'be', 'removed', 'cross', 'guardian', 'angel', 'life', 'normal', 'life', 'Jesus', 'same', 'choice', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'cost', 'choice', 'God', 'send', 'back', 'cross', 'allow', 'be', 'Messiah', 'then', 'taken', 'place', 'mind', 'truly', 'achieved', 'divinty', 'become', 'Messiah', 'final', 'moments', 'death.That', 'what', 'divinty', 'Christ', 'what', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'offered', 'choice', 'joys', 'sorrows', 'simple', 'humanity', 'Jesus', 'instead', 'took', 'up', 'cross', 'died', 'so', 'mankind', 'would', 'see', 'salvation', 'succeded', 'where', 'anyone', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'failed.That', 'what', 'really', 'be', 'divine', 'Son', 'God', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'OF', 'CHRIST', 'get', 'message', 'who', 'have', 'truly', 'heard', 'understood', 'teachings', 'Jesus', 'will', 'see', 'recognize', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'fanstatic', 'work', 'cinematic', 'religious', 'art']",N/A

Yet, as Scorcese has plainly stated, this movie only speculates as to what the human life of Jesus was like.  What personal price did he pay for his ministry?  Did he feel romantic love?  How did he deal with being in the middle of a spiritual war between good and evil?  How did he deal with the prospect of his own grisly death?Well, Scorcese powerfully brought to life the questions we have asked for 2000 years.  But he never places into question the Divinity of Christ, and Scorcese's Jesus falters but never leaves the path.  Sure, seeing Jesus depicted as a Roman flunky and fantasizing about Magdelene and women disturbed and even repulsed me.  But Jesus' conquest over fear and temptation in the desert, his healing of the sick, his crucifixion, and his strength at his last moment all uplifted me.As always, Scorcese's direction is impeccable and his sets are beautiful.  The violence in the movie is unflinching.

I never have been, so I watched this DVD solely out of curiousity, and am rating it purely on its entertainment value.  As such, I found it boring and poorly made.  First of, none of the actors or actresses looked Middle Eastern, considering this movie and all of its characters are Middle Eastern.  Second, some of the accents were horrible; case in point is Harvey Keitel's Judas, who has a Brooklyn accent.  Third, the casting of William Dafeo is entirely inappropriate.  This movie focuses on Jesus in the time just prior to his crucifixion, so Jesus is in his late 20's.  William Dafoe looks 35 - 40 in this movie.  Fourth, the soundtrack was poor.  Neither dramatic nor engaging, it leant no help to the storyline.  Last, the way the movie shows Jesus rising to various occasions was quite disappointing.

182501,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,1559409037,Octavius,"[5, 6]","Martin Scorsese's film on the life of Jesus Christ based on Nikos Kazantzakis's (author of 'Zorba The Greek') novel of the same title. The film is not as spectacular of a production as other Jesus films but, in addition to some good acting, the screenplay presents a unique view of God's only Son which other films (except perhaps for the musical 'Jesus Christ Superstar') haven't touched upon.The primary controversy in this film is Scorsese's de facto rejection of the Holy Trinity in his presentation of Jesus' character (Da Foe). Jesus is portrayed more as a human with divine attributes as opposed to being of a purely divine nature and flawless as God. This debate is nothing new as, around the 4th and 5th centuries A.D., the Arians based their faith on the notion of homoiousios: that Jesus was of a similar substance as God the father but not the same as God. In opposition, Athanasius' followers devised the &quot;pernicious doctrine&quot; which held that that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are one and the same. Somewhat following the tenets of the Arian heresy, Scorcese presents Jesus more as a human being endowed with a divine nature: emphasizing Jesus' trials and tribulations in the desert and later at his crucifixion (i.e. Father! Father! Why have you forsaken me!?&quot;) Another deviation is that Jesus is depicted here as being Mary Magdalene's lover and that she was his disciple: a proposition that almost all Christian denominations flatly reject.The acting is pretty good and the scenes move at a good pace. Unless one holds rather conservative beliefs as to Christianity, this film is quite enjoyable with good direction, acting, and cinematography. Finally, the film is also supported by Peter Gabriel's excellent soundtrack which is a gem in and of itself.",3,A Film On Jesus' Humanity,1091059200,"07 29, 2004",2004,1787,"['Martin', 'Scorsese', 'film', 'life', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'based', 'Nikos', 'Kazantzakis', 'author', 'Greek', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'film', 'not', 'spectacular', 'production', 'other', 'Jesus', 'films', 'addition', 'good', 'acting', 'screenplay', 'unique', 'view', 'God', 'only', 'Son', 'other', 'films', 'perhaps', 'musical', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'have', ""n't"", 'touched', 'upon.The', 'primary', 'controversy', 'film', 'Scorsese', 'de', 'facto', 'rejection', 'Holy', 'Trinity', 'presentation', 'Jesus', 'character', 'Da', 'Foe', 'Jesus', 'portrayed', 'more', 'human', 'divine', 'attributes', 'opposed', 'being', 'purely', 'divine', 'nature', 'flawless', 'God', 'debate', 'nothing', 'new', '4th', '5th', 'centuries', 'A.D.', 'Arians', 'based', 'faith', 'notion', 'homoiousios', 'Jesus', 'was', 'similar', 'substance', 'God', 'father', 'not', 'same', 'God', 'opposition', 'Athanasius', 'followers', 'devised', 'quot', 'pernicious', 'doctrine', 'quot', 'held', 'God', 'Jesus', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'are', 'one', 'same', 'Somewhat', 'following', 'tenets', 'Arian', 'heresy', 'Scorcese', 'presents', 'Jesus', 'more', 'human', 'being', 'endowed', 'divine', 'nature', 'emphasizing', 'Jesus', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'desert', 'later', 'crucifixion', 'i.e', 'Father', 'Father', 'Why', 'have', 'forsaken', 'quot', 'deviation', 'Jesus', 'depicted', 'here', 'being', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'lover', 'was', 'disciple', 'proposition', 'almost', 'Christian', 'denominations', 'flatly', 'reject.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'scenes', 'move', 'good', 'pace', 'one', 'rather', 'conservative', 'beliefs', 'Christianity', 'film', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'direction', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'Finally', 'film', 'also', 'supported', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'gem']",N/A

Devout Christian hardliners should stay away though because the story does use quite a lot of poetic license - but it does justify it in many ways. Basically this film caused a ruckus among some Christian hardliners because Jesus has sexual intercourse in the film. ""Wait?"" I hear you say. ""Surely that kind of blasphemy should boast disapproval from every Christian worldwide?"" ""Neigh"" I say. ""You do not know why it is there until you see the film in its entirety.""The film is based on Nikos Kazantzakis' 1955 novel which caused such an outrage that the Catholic Church banned it and the Greek Orthodox Church excommunicated him. When Martin Scorsese released the film in 1988 the church stayed somewhat quiet but groups affiliated with Christian rights went spastic when they heard that the movie was in production. Universal who financed the picture arranged a private advance screening for some of these groups because of a fear that it could tarnish their image. The groups went nuts, starting demonstrating on the streets outside cinemas and Christian radio and television shows raved on about the blasphemous film nonstop 24/7 - so of course the whole world ended up watching it and people who knew nothing about it or never went to cinema ended up queuing miles around the block to see it.In short, God and Jesus are not mocked by any means. In fact they are glorified. Scorsese himself is a fan of big J and it shows in this wonderful and thoroughly engaging film that is probably Scorseses best work. Jesus is a lonely and psychologically disturbed carpenter who is alive during the oppressive regime of Rome. He has hallucinations which drive him to preach the new word of God. His performs miracles and starts a revolt against the system. He doubts his own abilities and confides in many dark secrets with his closets friends. The TEMPTATION in this film is Jesus refusing to acknowledge himself, always failing to become what he was meant to be. There is an excellent twist in this film which does grab you by collar and shakes you around. Very good indeed and nicely executed by Scorsese.There are some critics about this film but they are usually aesthetic in value, namely the New York accents and some of the dialog is very ""Down Town"" or ""Lower East Side"". Apart from that this movie is a wonderful experience and utterly compelling.

182505,A376UHS8GODI8W,1559409037,Patrick Selitrenny,"[4, 6]","I remember when I went to watch its premiere in New York City, there were some fanatical ""believers"" who actually tried to stop the audience to actually enter the movie theater in order to view it...I was one of those viewers, and I remember that one of those knuckleheads, sitting on the stairs grabbed me by the seams of my pants and tried to physically block me from entering. Thinking that this was not enough he yelled something about ""a curse that would befall me, together with the loss of my sacred soul and finally the doom of excommunication"".Well, I was raised a catholic, but very soon detached myself from any kind of mumbo-jumbo in any form and fashion. Today I live happily and have never been plagued by demons nor zombies.Perhaps I am too much of a pragmatic, but fact is that I have lived a full life without any nightmares what-so-ever, due to this fact.After such a treatment, I was expecting to watch a kind of catholic ""The Exorcist"" filled with demons splattering peas and creamed spinach, all over Jesus, or worse, that Jesus would do so himself...What I was dished up with, was nothing new to me. Whoever studies a bit carefully the historic period of these events, will sooner or later cross some documents that tend to corroborate the theories examined in Martin Scorsese's movie. Even Kazantzakis must have discovered them, and just limited himself to make sense out of it all and put it down in novel form.Nothing shocking in this.Besides, if one would stop just for a moment to reflect who the people were who lived in Palestine in those years, would know that common people had enough to struggle with, not to be so devoted to the first guy who would call himself a Messiah.People were more down to Earth and less leaping across golden clouds in a nice blue sky. They were occupied by the Romans, and the Romans at that time and in that place were just behaving as the Waffen-SS did on the Eastern Front in World War II.Either you obeyed and submitted, or you were dead meat.No wonder then some scenes, very human ones at that, when Judas, and even Peter accuse Jesus of being a coward. Of course, the Apostles are a far cry from the fairytale version we have in the Gospels or even in other Devotion oriented pictures of yesteryear.But because of this, they truly come through as true, living, breathing, and yes, bleeding human beings. Not puppets, not just silent followers, or dreamers, but factual friends of Jesus, concerned with his actions and his behavior, if not his image.And Jesus himself comes through as a man. Not a divine being, but just a man. In this there are many parallels even in Greek, Persian and Sumerian religious mythology. Just look for instance Herakles or Hercules if you prefer, being put on Earth by Zeus in order to be tested as a human being.Jesus has only become divine after his crucifixion, not before.Also to be noted, was the many doubts Hebrews had about the mere existence of an actual Messiah figure. They didn't even know if it was one person, or a group of persons, who had to walk the Earth to be recognized as such.Moreover, many behave as if Jesus had been a sort of a Christian pastor or a monk. Far from all this. He was Hebrew by birth and Jew by religion.Besides what is the importance of all this?He came to save all Mankind, not just a group of morons, or at least this was his original intention.Remains to be seen and to be proven if he truly managed to succeed in this or if he failed.After all there is no more justice nowadays in this world than there was back then.And who is really and closely following his teachings?We don't even respect the basic ten commandments. OK, we may not kill, nor steal, but all the other commandments? C'mon, be honest...Ever watched ""The Godfather""?Well, this would teach you more about our failings as so-called Christians than any scripture.And to all those who ""think"" they are born-again Christians or just Christians I would suggest to look deeply into a mirror and tell themselves what they truly see in it and whether or not they like what they see mirrored in it.Isn't it written ""do not onto others, what you..."" etc. and so forth, or even ""do no judge others, lest you..."" and yadi-da and yadi-di.Of course I just cite these passages losely, also because I do not really remember their original formula. But you grasp the idea...This movie to me is probably an appropriate companion to ""The Passion of Christ"" and completes, together maybe with the more ""devoted"" ""Jesus of Nazareth"" TV-Miniseries directed by Franco Zeffirelli the entire lifespan on Earth of a man known as Jesus, who by his deeds, his doubts and his final courage and endurance, managed to enter in some way our own hearts and become to some of us, an example, a guru, a teacher, a master and to others, simply the Messiah.May it be as it may, there has never been another tale such as this one, and amazing it still is.I can guarantee you this. If I had been in his place, I would have chosen to live a long life and forgotten all about the scriptures, even if this would have meant to go into exile into a foreign land.The doubts he had and has in this Motion Picture are those each and everyone would have, if we were confronted with such a choice: to die nailed on a Roman Cross, after being whipped almost to death, and all this in the slowest way possible.Those who would do so without a doubt or simply going to their death in this way, with a smile on their faces, are either insane or were dropped on the floor when they were babies.Criterion has done a marvelous job with this DVD, cleaning the image up and even the sound is discreet.A last word of warning.If you are a true believer, stay away from this movie, it may offend some of your beliefs, but if you can stay open minded and objective, then this movie will please you.Only remember, just bits and parts, diverge from the original story told by the gospels, the rest is deja-vu.The acting is up to par. Willem Dafoe as Jesus is acceptable, but has somewhat the appearance of bum, rather than a Rabbi. Harvey Keitel steals the show in this movie. His forceful interpretation comes through loud and clear.I can highly recommend it.

Keller ""Packerfan75""","[10, 56]","Slander (slan/der) n. defamation; calumny, a malicious, false and defamatory statement or report. ex:'The Last Temptation of Christ' is a sick and sad attempt to slander the name, identity and image of The Lord Jesus Christ.You have to question the motives of anyone who would make an awful film of awful lies about Jesus Christ. Even if you don't believe He's the Son of God, how could anyone have anything against Him, who would otherwise be called a great man? He healed the sick, raised the dead, fed the hungry, gave life to the lifeless and hope to the hopeless, showed compassion, mercy and forgiveness everywhere He went. And yet He's persecuted.To make Him out to be lesser than He is, is only one of this films perversions (He is all God and all man). His supposed relationship with Mary Magdelene, His defiance to serve God and the false image of Him being a weakling are only a couple of others. This film feeds off the lies that have been told of Him and the lies that continue to be told. Every Christmas and Easter you hear all of these supposed ""new discoveries"" about how Jesus may have not done this or that or that the Bible may be wrong about this or that. Garbage like 'The Da Vinci Code'. It's not enough for people to be settled in their unbelief, no, then they have to go on the attack. Why do they bother attacking something they don't believe in anyways? There's no reason to, unless they fear it just may be the truth. The only way they can hope to avoid the conviction they feel in their hearts is to harden their hearts and spread lies to try and silence the voice of God inside them. Then they can go on sinning, feeling good about it, with their godless, humanistic mindset intact. This movie is nothing but a disgusting attempt to debase the holy and righteous Son of God by some blind and spiritually dead people trying to protect their own distorted self image.I guess the fact that Martin Scorsese directed this trash doesn't come as too much a suprise. Look at his other films, they glorify gangsters, are filled with profanities, sexuality/nudity, excessive violence/gore and there's never a good message to be found anywhere. He obviously likes that stuff. As it is written ""out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks"". Well, Martin Scorsese has spoken and I have and will continue to have nothing to do with his films. Pride hardens the heart. And a fable like this is a prime example of it. Scorsese and Co. have weaved a sickening tale of vicious lies. Going on the attack trying to cast doubt to protect themselves make themselves feel superior and good about themselves. But I wonder, is there anything precious or sacred to him? What if someone made a movie trashing it? If he only knew what he was talking about or missing out on. Sad. But he and all those involved will face the Lord one day and have to account for these lies. If they haven't repented then God have mercy on them.If you really want to learn about Jesus Christ, God gave us an account of His life in the Bible (the book of John is a great place to start). If you want to personally know Jesus Christ, the good news is that He can be found right where He says He is. You can call on Him and He will answer. He's waiting on you for the opportunity to save you, come into your heart and life and make you part of the family of God. You can be saved if you'll just accept who He is and what He did for us on the cross. Repent, call upon his name, confess yourself a sinner and ask Him into your life as your Lord and Savior. Forgiveness, mercy, grace, eternal life, life more abundant here, a new heart and spirit, and a real relationship with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are available if you'll just reach out in faith and trust Him now. Whoever you are, whatever you've done, God made a way through Jesus for you to have a new start, a new beginning, and a new life with Him. You can know of God's abounding love for you today.If you don't want to believe that Jesus is the Savior and the only way to God and Heaven, that's your choice. God will allow it. You can reject Jesus Christ as your Savior, choose sin over salvation, and Hell over Heaven and God will honor your choice by allowing you to go where you want, even to Hell. Because even though God loves you more than you can imagine, He won't force you to love Him or be with Him. But God doesn't send people to Hell, without Jesus, we're already on our way there. We're already condemned and sitting on death row, waiting for the day of execution because we cannot take our sins to Heaven and there's nowhere else to go but Hell. We cannot please, know or be with God till we are forgiven and born again in the spirit. Our sins separate us from holy God. But Jesus paid the price for us by bearing our sins so that we may be saved from an eternity in Hell. ""While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us"". Man has tried to invent many ways to Heaven but God made only one, through Jesus Christ, and we should be grateful He did that.""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through Him might be saved."" John 3:16-17.Jesus said, ""Trust in God, trust also in me. In my Fathers house are many mansions, if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you. I will come back and take you with me that you also may be where I am. I am the way the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me"".

Yes, he was tempted and probably by some of the things in this movie. But depicting him as being weak and confused is unforgivable, fiction or not.

182513,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,1559409037,R.A. McKenzie,"[8, 10]","""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is easily the hardest film I've ever tried to review.  My father is a Lutheran minister, and I gladly share that I believe in Jesus as my Savior.  I also am a huge admirer of Scorsese's works (""GoodFellas"" and ""Raging Bull"" are my two favorites).  I knew this was going to be a difficult movie to watch, but the movie's bizarre style still sinks in my memory and won't let go.The movie, based on Nikos Kazantzakis' novel, is a fictional depiction of Jesus and the people he encountered.  Kazantzakis' story is a significant departure from the biblical account: Jesus Christ is a conflicted, struggling, and imperfect being.  We first see him being driven to insanity because he ignores God's commands, and then builds crosses to punish himself.  He is clearly tempted by Mary Magdalene's beauty, but reluctantly resists the sexual urge.  Judas (Harvey Keitel), the disciple who betrays Jesus, is actually his closest companion in this story.  Judas has a kind of ""tough love"" --- he'll serve his master wherever he goes, but does so more out of loyalty than out of compassion.  He's also a militant patriot for the Jews, but cannot understand why the spirit is the most crucial aspect of one's self-preservation.  After Jesus spends some time isolated in the desert, he accepts his role as God's instrument of salvation.  Christ does not always know how to fulfill this purpose, but that is part of the 'character' - he struggles to let himself go free and let the Word flow through his mouth.I mention these details because if you expect a biblical retelling of Jesus' final days on Earth, you'll be too surprised to pay attention to what's on the screen.  Besides, all of that description I just gave is just the opening plot in a nutshell.Martin Scorsese always finds a way to put a new spin on a conventional topic.  Oddly enough --- and this is not a criticism --- ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" doesn't feel like it's one of his movies.  It's a rare Scorsese flick where the writing brings more to the table than his eye-pleasing style.  I don't see this as Scorsese's movie, but author Kazantakis' fictional work come to life.This is one bizarre piece of filmmaking.  The characters don't have consistent accents, most notably Keitel's Judas sounding like he's from Brooklyn.  Peter Gabriel's musical score, as his DVD extra explains, uses authentic Middle Eastern instruments, but also some electronic chords that sound like ""Miami Vice"" had a say in the soundtrack.  The characters' different roles in this story versus the biblical text are obvious.  To name a few, John The Baptist comes off as a maniacal enthusiast with a powerful message behind his madness, and Pontius Pilate is just a direct speaker of hard truths rather than a heartless dictator.  In fact, the dialogue in this movie is very direct and to-the-point.  It's rarely poetic or metaphorical, but about as straight-forward as you can speak.What's most noteworthy about this film is that the temptations of Satan aren't glaringly evil, but rather more subtle and beautifully disguised.  For example, when Jesus is near death on the Cross, Satan doesn't show up as a demonic being & begin to taunt Jesus.  Instead, an angelic girl with a soft voice makes explains why God DOESN'T want Jesus to sacrifice himself.  I won't reveal what happens next, but what follows is probably what got detractors so upset --- more on that later.My only complaint, as far as filmmaking goes, is that the disciples aren't given much depth.  I can see why they are compelled to follow Jesus, but with the exception of Judas, they are written as pawns of a higher purpose with little to contribute.  Then again, Jesus appropriately does most of the talking.Although I believe some objections to this film are overly strong, I can see why some people opposed it back in 1988.  I'll admit it: I am slightly uncomfortable that Kazantzakis explored this subject by anachronistic means --- in other words, he tries to find the truth throught fictional juxtapositions.  However, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is a movie that gets me talking about the subject.  God has allowed me to view this fictional work so that I can find the motiviation to explore this subject with more urgency.Here's the key message of the film:Jesus overcame his obstacles and temptations in order to save us.  In this account, he doesn't sacrifice himself because he 'knew' it was the right thing to do.  Jesus only completely accpets his Crucifixion when he finally 'wants' to be the Savior.  That's the origin of the heated debates surrounding this controversial tale.  There is no disagreement that Jesus Christ wanted to do God's will, but the question that divides is this: ""Did he ever struggle to serve God, or was he perfect at all times?""My interpretation is that God created human beings to be free-willing ministers of faith.  God did not want robotic servants, but wanted people to fear his power yet embrace his undying love.  I believe when it comes to his Son, God did not want a robotic sacrifice.  He instead wanted a divine being (his Son the Christ) to give himself freely.  I know that doesn't answer the question of who's right, but like Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"", this movie refuses to answer all of your questions...it wants YOU to start asking them.How you view this movie depends on where you stand with religion and God.  Because I've been raised around Lutheranism my entire life, the differences between the film's plot and the biblical text are jarring and a little uncomfortable at times.The comparisons to Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"", another excellent movie, are almost unavoidable.  I believe Gibson's film is more visceral and gut-wrenching, yet a little incomplete.  Kazanztakis' described his exploration of this subject as ""the eternal conflict between the soul and the flesh"" --- I don't fully embrace his efforts, but it is thought-provoking and not without merit.  I wish that he stuck to a more literal interpretation of the Bible, but ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" poses bold questions that Christians and theologians should consider.I can't say whether you'll love this film, or completely reject it.  What I guarantee is that when you're done watching this film, you're gonna be talking about it.  Any movie that inspires thoughtful discussion deserves credit.EXTRAS* The Commentary by director Martin Scorsese, screenwriter Paul Schrader, actor Willem Dafoe, and producer Jay Cocks is a good listen.  Even though the four recorded separate tracks that were edited together for one Commentary, they rarely repeat each other.  Not quite as good as a Kurosawa film's Criterion commentary, but still a keeper.* Peter Gabriel's featurette on how he recorded his music score is interesting.  He talks about which instruments he used, and briefly discusses his research.* There's a weird VHS video where Scorsese recorded some on-the-set footage back in 1987.  It's mildly entertaining.* There's also a photo gallery that shows some magazines & book references that Scorsese used inspire his look of the film.

So I rented it out of curiosity. Long Story Short: I liked it. This is one of the best Jesus stories of all time.STORY: In the final days of Christ, a faithfully weak Christ comes to love God, and comes to believe he is the messiah. Then at his time of trial and execution, Jesus iscrucified and hung on the cross. During the crucifixion, everything goes mute at one point. Jesus looks down and sees a guardian angel, which is really Satan in disguise who saves Jesus and shows him what his life is like if he WASN'T the messiah. Jesus marries, has sex with Mary M (which made me squirm throughout the entire sex scene- eww) and has 3 kids. Then, When he is dyaing and 70 years old, Jesus learns that Satan had tricked him and tried him.THOUGHTS: A very faithful movie. Scorsese's best since MEAN STREETS. A really good film that needs to be seen by ALL christians. I gotta admit, I was very uncomfortable with the marraige scene, and I was squirming thruout the scene where Jesus was ""banging"" Mary, but then the rest was good. One scene I can't get over is the shot of Jesus walking, then more and more disciples follow him, with the cool techno music playing. Went perfectly.OVER ALL: See this movie!EDIT 10/31/06:Just got the DVD, and read the essay... what a real waste of paper.

If you're expecting profound blasphemy and other good stuff, this is actually tame like a punk that bought all their outfit at Hot Topic. For one thing, the movie dares show Jesus might have had a different mind than most people, one prone to breakdown that might lead him to imagine he's God. But there's not much point to showing this side since he is also shown performing every miracle. There's no dispute in the film to his superhuman status, which makes the fact that this film was so controversial very funny. Jesus comes across as kind of a spacey neurotic and more than a bit unprepared to be the magical son of God, but still it's faithful to Christianity in message. Much of his fear and doubt are just interpretation of the Bible and common sense take on the character.I suppose the fact that there's a prostitute doing her job on several men while Jesus waits around to talk to her, is the big edginess to the film. Either that or that Judas is a bit of an expanded and different role. Yet why get offended over such things, they're hardly that shocking in the long run. It's unfortunate that to some degree I think this movie has to be defended against Christian maniacs, and rated a bit higher. Just the fact that they'll toss so many 1 ratings at it like the people stoning others in the movie, gives films like this on obvious need for appreciation. So give it a watch at least once.

The water didn't dampen my spirits much at all, but the movie did.  Somewhere toward the end of the film it occurred to me that the story's arc was largely identical in essence to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  And throughout the years, any time I attempt to enjoy this movie on its own terms, when it gets to the scene where Jesus, after seeing the meaninglessness of his life without his execution, calls upon God to please crucify him all I keep seeing is George Bailey praying to God on that snowy bridge to please let him live again.  Now the Capra movie came out in 1946.  The Kazantzakis novel - which was the basis for Scorsese's film - was first published in 1953.  Until I knew this there was the possibility that Bailey's saga was influenced by the spiritual and physical conflicts of Christ as portrayed in the controversial novel. Had this been the case I might have been able to accept the inspiration of Kazantzakis' novel more readily.  But no.  Therefore, quite possibly the novel may very well have been influenced by IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The point is that, for me, this artistic parallel ruins the film for me - most especially when the fantasy sequence begins.

Perhaps the directors were afraid to make it interesting for fears of giving the protestors something to actually shout about!  This film didn't get me to think anything else about Jesus (good or bad) but this was quite the failed opportunity to do so.  The idea of painting a fresh, perhaps contemporary portrait of Jesus was a good idea that continues to deserve exploration (in fact, look at the book ""Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal"" for a rather satirical, yet kind treatment of the subject as an example of this being done right.As for the protests, they're probably the only reason this film made money.  Honestly, the only reason I went to see the film was because of the fuss it stirred up, I had to see what others thought shouldn't be played!  I remember an eldely Nun being trotted out before the cameras before the film was released to warn us that ""the Father will not stand by while his Son is mocked.""  That sort of threat alone made me want to see it!It's a persons' right to voice their opinion of course, but most of the time these calls to ban movies or music backfire on the opposition.

182523,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,1559409037,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[2, 3]","An interesting film, originally branded heretical by the Catholic Church.  Actually the first three-quarters of the movie is not particularly heretical despite the fact that it portrays a very human Jesus, a man initially confused by what seems to be happening and later reluctant to accept the fate that he knows is in store for him.Jesus [Dafoe's] relationship with Judas [Harvey Keitel] is probably the most interesting part of the story despite the fact that it is converse to most Christian theology.  Judas isn't a traitor but, instead, is Jesus most trusted apostle--an apostle entrusted with the nasty duty of 'betraying' his Master to his enemies.  Actually, I believe that this makes much better sense than the Judas as Betrayer versions.  If Jesus could predict his own death, then he could predict his betrayer.  He may very well have collaborated with him.  'Go quickly and do what you must do.'  Jesus orders Judas at the Last Supper--and--Judas does.  It has every appearance of an agreement between the two men.The last part of the movie, although completely nondoctrinal, has a lot to do with the excellent little book 'An Occurrence at Owl Creek.'  A Creole man is arrested as a spy and condemned to be hanged from the bridge at Owl Creek.  The rope breaks and our man hits the water and dives.  Yankee bullets whistle around him but he swims down the river and escapes into a thicket.  He painfully makes his way home to his plantation house only to be greeted by is sweetly smiling, beautiful wife.  The problem is, she has been dead for several years.  SNAP!  Our Creole man comes to he end of the rope and his neck snaps.'The Last Temptation' is very similar.  Jesus is 'tempted' down from the cross and is led to safety by his guardian angel.  Jesus leads a full life with wife and children only to learn, in his old age, that his 'guardian angel' is Satan he Trickster.  SNAP!  Jesus is back on the cross where he dies.Rather than sacriligeous, the tale--like 'An Occurrence at Owl Creek'--can be styled as an effort to depict the fact that, reportedly, things may slow way down at the moment of death and even be attended by realistic hallucinations.

What really adds to the drama of the film is the soundtrack by Peter Gabriel.Having received 12 years of Catholic school education, culminating when this film was released, I was amused to read the incredible outpouring of emotions by narrow-minded Christians against this film, both at the time is was released and in the reviews.  To me, a sure-fire sign of narrow-mindedness is their utter inability to appreciate art for what it is and the fact (evident from their reviews) that they have not even seen the movie.  My faith was not so weak as to refuse to entertain artistic explorations and alternative viewpoints.Although not wholly based on the scriptures, the theme of this film IS based more upon the very nature of Jesus Christ himself.  That is, the film and the book both attempt to dramatically explore the contradictions associated with the dual identity of Jesus as both God and man - a schitzophrenic combination indeed.SPOILERS AHEAD:In this film, Jesus as man resists God's call, at age 30, to take up his role as spiritual savior. Jesus-as-man IS tempted by his own thoughts and doubts (manifested by Satan), the last temptation occuring in a stupor as he hangs dying on the cross - the opportunity of becoming all man.  This post-death illusion sequence, where Jesus goes on to marry Mary Magdeline and see the dire consequences of such a course of action, covers the last 3rd or so of the film.  What is most interesting is the confrontation between Jesus and Paul, the latter of whom is the most signficant evangelical Christian of all time - which turns out to be an express of the argument that the idea of Jesus Christ as savior may have been more important (at least politically) that the historical facts.  In any case, for those who find this sequence blasphemous, they need to remember that it is a DREAM.  (e.g., The crowds are still cheering at the cross as he is taken down by a lovely little girl.)  In the end, Jesus triumphs over the evil of human frailty to assume his position in Christian beliefs.Other interesting factors include the expanded role of Judas (played here by Harvey Kietel), as Jesus' true right-hand man.  In an interesting twist, Judas is at least as interested in political revolution as a spiritual one, and Jesus manipulates Judas' anger and convinces him to turn Jesus in for persecution.In any case, I give it a firm thumbs up.

Severe digital noise, unacceptable macro-blocking and banding, especially around Satan's pillar of fire in the desert 59 minutes into the film. And what is wrong with you people, who think this is a gorgeous disc, who say ""Last Temptation has never looked this good!""? None of you ever saw the film projected on 35mm in the cinema, if that is the case. And here is proof...When Jesus dies at the end (spoiler alert!) the film's image is ""burned"" off of the screen by the power of God and the audience are left looking at a blank white cinema screen upon which the bright white end credits pop. For the VHS and DVD releases, that end title sequence has been darkened to a tawny gold to make the end titles readable since white on white is very difficult to reproduce in Standard Def. But here we are in the new High Def world where that would not be a problem. An example is the end of MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL where the film breaks off and we are left looking at a blank white cinema screen. Sony has reproduced this perfectly in their recent stunning Blu-ray of that film. Criterion has NOT, I repeat NOT, done a new HD scan of Last Temptation for this Blu-ray release. They are using a 12 year old HD master that was created for the Standard Def release on DVD back in 2000. Hence the blocking and banding and washed out shadows. That is the proof, a new scan would have had none of these problems.This is not really Criterion's fault, it is Universal's. They simple handed Criterion the 12 year old master and left it up to them to publish the Blu-ray whilst they themselves published the DVD version of this release. This is an appalling Blu-ray of a great film. If enough people complained to Criterion, there might be a recall, and new scan would be done and the end titles would be as they were intended to be. That Scorsese, a director who professes to believe in original film integrity and preservation, should let this abominable release go, is a mystery to me. Yes, it says on the case that it was approved by Scorsese and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, but that was twelve years ago.So please, don't buy this Blu-ray.

182532,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,1559409037,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[15, 17]","When Martin Scorsese set out to make a film adaptation of the Niko Kazantzakis novel, The Last Temptation, the last thing that the legendary director intended to do was offend. The making of the film was a deeply personal spiritual quest for Scorsese, and one that he had felt burdened to complete for a very long time. Many years passed, and several attempts to produce the film failed. However, in 1987, production began, courtesy of MCA Universal who felt that the film was an important piece. The film almost immediately drew controversy, and several people tried to talk Scorsese and his crew out of making the film. Scorsese pressed on, believing strongly in the material. Production was rushed on a limited budget, and soon, Thelma Schoonmaker was editing for post-production. Meanwhile, hordes of right-wing extremists gathered round, promising to destroy the film once it was released. Upon the films release, the extremists were picketing and shouting boycott - rallying against a film that they had never even seen. Guards had to stand on each side of the theatre screen in just about any screening room in which the film was being shown, as there were threats to damage the screen during certain moments in the film which were deemed ""blasphemous"" by those who had probably never seen a dictionary in their lives; the very definition of the word ""blasphemy"" being lost on them. As it turns out, all of the controversy was for naught. The Last Temptation of Christ continues to be a highly philosophical, terribly misunderstood film to this very day, a film which explores the dual nature of Christ; a Jesus film not for mainstream audiences, but for the intellectual.Scorsese's film opens over Peter Gabriel's magnificent score with a disclaimer, which reads: This film is not based upon the Gospels but upon this fictional exploration of the eternal spiritual conflict - the eternal conflict being one of the spirit and the flesh. Jesus Christ was both man and God, existing in one body. As he was human, the Scriptures tell us that Christ was tempted in every way that man has been tempted, and as a result, God understands all that man has had to struggle against. This hypothetical envisioning of the Scriptures sees Christ as tormented, torn between loyalty to his Father and the desires of man. As portrayed by Willem Dafoe, we see Christ attempt time and time again to rebel against his calling, and yet, he can never bring himself to do it. Even as he builds crosses for the Roman soldiers, he cannot escape God's will, no matter how much he wants God to hate Him. We see Christ as he is tempted in the desert, we see him as he is tempted by Mary Magdalene (played by the excellent Barbara Hershey), and we watch him throughout the film, as he constantly tramples upon Satan and his snares. Ultimately, it is during the ""last temptation"" on the cross in which Christ reigns victorious.This controversial segment consists of Christ being tempted by Satan - who appears to him as an angelic little girl - as he is hanging from the cross. The young girl pulls the nails from his hands and feet, and removes the crown of thorns from his head. As she pulls him from the cross, the deceptive vision begins: Jesus enters a wedding procession, his wedding, in which he marries Mary Magdalene and starts a family. It is a lengthy dream sequence, as Jesus grows old, and Mary eventually dies. However, Judas (a magnificent Harvey Keitel) appears to Jesus, and reveals that he has been lured into this state by Satan. Christ wakes from this vision, still nailed to the cross, triumphant and ready to die for the sins of the world. As he utters the words, ""It is accomplished"", the screen fills with white light, blurs out, and the film ends.Most of the films detractors - the few who had seen it - must not have read the disclaimer at the front of the film, nor could they wrap their narrow minds around the fact that the last thirty minutes of the film are, indeed, an illusion. To some, the humanity of Jesus is highly disturbing because of all that it implies. Christ was tempted in every way that man has been tempted. He never sinned - nor does Dafoe's Jesus - but he was tempted all the same, and temptation is not pretty - granted when we face temptation, it looks much like the ""angel"" near the end of the film. It does not seem ugly at first, but slowly the veil is pulled away, revealing itself for what it really is. The Last Temptation of Christ is a powerful film. This is Scorsese's masterpiece.Rated R for violence and brief sexual content. 168 minutes.",5,"'The Last Temptation of Christ', a Jesus film for intellectuals",1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,4577,"['When', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Niko', 'Kazantzakis', 'novel', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'last', 'thing', 'legendary', 'director', 'intended', 'do', 'was', 'offend', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'deeply', 'personal', 'spiritual', 'quest', 'Scorsese', 'one', 'had', 'felt', 'burdened', 'complete', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Many', 'years', 'passed', 'several', 'attempts', 'produce', 'film', 'failed', 'However', '1987', 'production', 'began', 'courtesy', 'MCA', 'Universal', 'who', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'important', 'piece', 'film', 'almost', 'immediately', 'drew', 'controversy', 'several', 'people', 'tried', 'talk', 'Scorsese', 'crew', 'making', 'film', 'Scorsese', 'pressed', 'believing', 'strongly', 'material', 'Production', 'was', 'rushed', 'limited', 'budget', 'soon', 'Thelma', 'Schoonmaker', 'was', 'editing', 'post-production', 'Meanwhile', 'hordes', 'right-wing', 'extremists', 'gathered', 'round', 'promising', 'destroy', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'films', 'release', 'extremists', 'were', 'picketing', 'shouting', 'boycott', 'rallying', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'Guards', 'had', 'stand', 'side', 'theatre', 'screen', 'just', 'screening', 'room', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'shown', 'were', 'threats', 'damage', 'screen', 'certain', 'moments', 'film', 'were', 'deemed', 'blasphemous', 'who', 'had', 'probably', 'never', 'seen', 'dictionary', 'lives', 'very', 'definition', 'word', 'blasphemy', 'being', 'lost', 'out', 'controversy', 'was', 'naught', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ', 'be', 'highly', 'philosophical', 'terribly', 'misunderstood', 'film', 'very', 'day', 'film', 'dual', 'nature', 'Christ', 'Jesus', 'film', 'not', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'intellectual.Scorsese', 'film', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'magnificent', 'score', 'disclaimer', 'film', 'not', 'based', 'Gospels', 'fictional', 'exploration', 'eternal', 'spiritual', 'conflict', 'eternal', 'conflict', 'being', 'one', 'spirit', 'flesh', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'was', 'man', 'God', 'existing', 'one', 'body', 'was', 'human', 'Scriptures', 'tell', 'Christ', 'was', 'tempted', 'way', 'man', 'been', 'tempted', 'result', 'God', 'man', 'had', 'struggle', 'hypothetical', 'envisioning', 'Scriptures', 'Christ', 'tormented', 'loyalty', 'Father', 'desires', 'man', 'portrayed', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'see', 'Christ', 'attempt', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'rebel', 'calling', 'yet', 'can', 'never', 'bring', 'do', 'Even', 'crosses', 'Roman', 'soldiers', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'God', 'will', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'God', 'hate', 'Him', 'see', 'Christ', 'tempted', 'desert', 'see', 'tempted', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'played', 'excellent', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'watch', 'film', 'constantly', 'Satan', 'snares', 'Ultimately', 'last', 'temptation', 'cross', 'Christ', 'victorious.This', 'controversial', 'segment', 'Christ', 'being', 'tempted', 'Satan', 'who', 'angelic', 'little', 'girl', 'hanging', 'cross', 'young', 'girl', 'nails', 'hands', 'feet', 'crown', 'thorns', 'head', 'cross', 'deceptive', 'vision', 'Jesus', 'wedding', 'procession', 'wedding', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'family', 'lengthy', 'dream', 'sequence', 'Jesus', 'old', 'Mary', 'eventually', 'However', 'Judas', 'magnificent', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Jesus', 'reveals', 'been', 'lured', 'state', 'Satan', 'Christ', 'vision', 'still', 'nailed', 'cross', 'triumphant', 'ready', 'die', 'sins', 'world', 'words', 'accomplished', 'screen', 'white', 'light', 'out', 'film', 'ends.Most', 'films', 'detractors', 'few', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'read', 'disclaimer', 'front', 'film', 'could', 'wrap', 'narrow', 'minds', 'fact', 'last', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'indeed', 'illusion', 'humanity', 'Jesus', 'highly', 'disturbing', 'Christ', 'was', 'tempted', 'way', 'man', 'been', 'tempted', 'never', 'sinned', 'Dafoe', 'Jesus', 'was', 'tempted', 'same', 'temptation', 'not', 'pretty', 'granted', 'when', 'face', 'temptation', 'much', 'angel', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'seem', 'ugly', 'first', 'slowly', 'veil', 'pulled', 'away', 'revealing', 'what', 'really', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ', 'powerful', 'film', 'Scorsese', 'masterpiece.Rated', 'R', 'violence', 'brief', 'sexual', 'content', '168', 'minutes']",N/A

As a Christian, I went in with an open mind. My thoughts on the film: it is not sacreligious, but the story is way too revisionist for my taste. My criticism of the film arises from three complaints:1. I felt that Willem Dafoe's depiction of Christ made Him TOO human, and terribly indecisive. Given, Jesus the Christ was human as well as God incarnate, but He was never indecisive.2. Making Jesus a cross-maker only was a little too much.3. The whole story with Judas Iscariot was totally stupid. I thought that Harvey Keitel wasn't trying hard enough as Judas. Plus, his hair was horrible. I also felt that Jesus &quot;begging&quot; Judas to betray him was ludicrous.If you're looking for an accurate portrayal of Jesus the Christ, Gibson's &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; is the movie I recommend.

There's also an interview with Peter Gabriel, who composed the soundtrack (an excellent one; I recommend the CD edition of it). As for the story itself, well, the controversy surrounding the plot is well known. It challenges us to step outside our pre-conceptions of who Jesus was and what he might have had to endure, to finally triumph on the cross. The performances in the film are good ones, but I would have chosen another actor to play Jesus.

182537,A2F6IIBONO2V48,1559409037,strangeitude,"[1, 2]","This review is response to the bad criticism.First of all I will acknowledge that some criticism perhaps is true to some 'artistic' choices, when we speak of cinematic terms: Yes, Harvey Keitel modern accent perhaps was not the best choice; I believe also that some scenes are set like a theater piece, like a play, in the interaction between actors, that may give the impresion to some viewers of 'pedestrian' dialogue; W Daefoe Jesus character may be unsympathetic sometimes, with all his doubts and youthful wit, it does not represent at all the mighty and godly Jesus Christ of every other film about this subject. For all that, Yes, Scorsese is 'guilty'.But then, any of above really matters? This movie is like a message and the master of it is that is not controversial at all, only the most jealeous religious fundamentalists cry of hate for this movie, but with time, even some Christians groups now admit that Last Temptation of Christ is a credible and somehow 'correct' account of the Jesus figure. The duality of Man and God, that is what Christ represents, The Son of God. Are'nt we all Sons of God? Are'nt all we made to His image? If Jesus is God and He is human also, why is it bad that He cries, that He suffers, that He is doubtful? Jesus of Nazareth, the son of a poor carpenter, did'nt he have the right to feel fear of the mission God set upon him?? This movie is like a message because it represents what Christianity is all about, and not only that, how it might have formed at the beginning, you just have to look a little deeper, you have to trascend this movie as just a movie; and as a movie, there are plenty of moments:- When Jesus saves Magdalene from being stoned to death: that's Jesus!- When the Baptist recognizes Jesus and baptized him, is a very powerful scene.- Jesus convincing Judas that is Love, not war the answer: that's Jesus! (nothing like 'I am the son of God teaching you poor humans', just two persons and friends talking and having an argument, like anyone of us)- Jesus resurrecting Lazarus, is eerie, filled with the scent of death, and then the greatest miracle..- Peter Gabriel soundtrack is marvelous, his original music and how he fusion it with Eastern typical sounds: Peter Gabriel is a genius!- The filming was done on location in Morocco, that gives it a very realistic setting: Martin Scorsese is a genius!Through the whole film the divinity of Jesus is not questioned. Perhaps there is a scene that some faithful believers will not dig at all, and in my opinion is very important in the film: when in his temptation (an hallucination) Jesus is confronted by Paul, where in a rationalistic manner Paul tells him that Jesus message is more important than Jesus himself, and gives the skeptics a very good argument, in practical terms, of how Christianity became the one of the greatest religions.The fictional account of Jesus making crosses might dislike some, but remember that the producers disclaim that the movie is NOT based in the gospels and that it is ""fictional"". Yet, you can find some of the most important events that the Gospels describe, the rage at the market: ""God is an inmortal spirit that belongs to all of us!...you think you are special? God is not an israelite!""; but in the sermon scene, when Jesus preaches Love and the people ran yelling 'kill them!', you can see pretty the same what has happened with the greatest misunderstanding of the Jesus figure: the millions killed in his name. ""I did'nt say Death, I said Love!"": that's Jesus!In the pure sense, Jesus Christ did not want to begin a religion, he did'nt want churches and power, he was one the greatest human beings of all mankind (if not the greatest). I am not a religious person, I don't go to Church, I do not read the Bible, but if I dug the message of this movie I could say that we are all the Son of God, with all our all doubts and fears, that I am revolutionary (in the good sense of the word) and also a man of love: a Christian.So if you are a Christian and you haven't seen this movie because you think it might offend your beliefs, my suggestion is that you do not have to worry about it, just free your mind of any conceptualism and you will see the greatest story ever, shown in a movie with an alternative approach done by very talented people.P.S. To the people who read the book, please do not compare it to the movie, I haven't read the book, I'm sure is very good (and like most cases, if not all, 'better' than the movie) but this movie stands on its own.",5,More than a movie,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,4520,"['review', 'response', 'bad', 'criticism.First', 'will', 'acknowledge', 'criticism', 'perhaps', 'true', ""'artistic"", 'choices', 'when', 'speak', 'cinematic', 'terms', 'Yes', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'modern', 'accent', 'perhaps', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'choice', 'believe', 'also', 'scenes', 'are', 'set', 'theater', 'piece', 'play', 'interaction', 'actors', 'may', 'give', 'impresion', 'viewers', ""'pedestrian"", 'dialogue', 'W', 'Daefoe', 'Jesus', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'unsympathetic', 'sometimes', 'doubts', 'youthful', 'wit', 'not', 'represent', 'mighty', 'godly', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'other', 'film', 'subject', 'Yes', 'Scorsese', ""'guilty'.But"", 'then', 'really', 'matters', 'movie', 'message', 'master', 'not', 'controversial', 'only', 'most', 'jealeous', 'religious', 'fundamentalists', 'cry', 'hate', 'movie', 'time', 'even', 'Christians', 'groups', 'now', 'admit', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ', 'credible', 'somehow', ""'correct"", 'account', 'Jesus', 'figure', 'duality', 'Man', 'God', 'what', 'Christ', 'Son', 'God', ""Are'nt"", 'Sons', 'God', ""Are'nt"", 'made', 'image', 'Jesus', 'God', 'human', 'also', 'why', 'bad', 'doubtful', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'son', 'poor', 'carpenter', ""did'nt"", 'have', 'right', 'feel', 'fear', 'mission', 'God', 'set', 'movie', 'message', 'what', 'Christianity', 'not', 'only', 'that', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'formed', 'beginning', 'just', 'have', 'look', 'little', 'deeper', 'have', 'trascend', 'movie', 'just', 'movie', 'movie', 'are', 'plenty', 'moments', 'When', 'Jesus', 'Magdalene', 'being', 'stoned', 'death', 'Jesus', 'When', 'Baptist', 'Jesus', 'baptized', 'very', 'powerful', 'scene.-', 'Jesus', 'convincing', 'Judas', 'Love', 'not', 'war', 'answer', 'Jesus', 'nothing', 'am', 'son', 'God', 'teaching', 'poor', 'humans', 'just', 'two', 'persons', 'friends', 'talking', 'having', 'argument', 'anyone', 'Jesus', 'resurrecting', 'Lazarus', 'eerie', 'filled', 'scent', 'death', 'then', 'greatest', 'miracle..-', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'soundtrack', 'marvelous', 'original', 'music', 'how', 'fusion', 'Eastern', 'typical', 'sounds', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'genius', 'filming', 'was', 'done', 'location', 'Morocco', 'very', 'realistic', 'setting', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'genius', 'whole', 'film', 'divinity', 'Jesus', 'not', 'questioned', 'Perhaps', 'scene', 'faithful', 'believers', 'will', 'not', 'dig', 'opinion', 'very', 'important', 'film', 'when', 'temptation', 'hallucination', 'Jesus', 'confronted', 'Paul', 'where', 'rationalistic', 'manner', 'Paul', 'Jesus', 'message', 'more', 'important', 'Jesus', 'skeptics', 'very', 'good', 'argument', 'practical', 'terms', 'how', 'Christianity', 'became', 'one', 'greatest', 'religions.The', 'fictional', 'account', 'Jesus', 'making', 'crosses', 'might', 'dislike', 'remember', 'producers', 'disclaim', 'movie', 'NOT', 'based', 'gospels', 'fictional', 'can', 'find', 'most', 'important', 'events', 'Gospels', 'describe', 'rage', 'market', 'God', 'inmortal', 'spirit', 'think', 'are', 'special', 'God', 'not', 'israelite', 'sermon', 'scene', 'when', 'Jesus', 'Love', 'people', 'ran', 'yelling', ""'kill"", 'can', 'see', 'pretty', 'same', 'happened', 'greatest', 'misunderstanding', 'Jesus', 'figure', 'millions', 'killed', 'name', ""did'nt"", 'say', 'Death', 'said', 'Love', 'Jesus', 'pure', 'sense', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'begin', 'religion', 'want', 'churches', 'power', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'human', 'beings', 'mankind', 'not', 'greatest', 'am', 'not', 'religious', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'Church', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'Bible', 'dug', 'message', 'movie', 'could', 'say', 'are', 'Son', 'God', 'doubts', 'fears', 'am', 'revolutionary', 'good', 'sense', 'word', 'also', 'man', 'love', 'Christian.So', 'are', 'Christian', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'think', 'might', 'offend', 'beliefs', 'suggestion', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'worry', 'just', 'free', 'mind', 'conceptualism', 'will', 'see', 'greatest', 'story', 'ever', 'shown', 'movie', 'alternative', 'approach', 'done', 'very', 'talented', 'people.P.S', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'compare', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'m"", 'sure', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'cases', 'not', ""'better"", 'movie', 'movie', 'own']",N/A

Concerned about the charges of ""blasphemy!"" that I heard shouted by the movie's most ardent critics -- including many who hadn't seen the film but only knew of some of its contents -- I avoided it for the better part of 20 years.  Friends whom I trust suggested the movie's spiritual content was not ""that bad"" and the film had some redeeming value to it.So I rented it with an open mind, hoping to see a depection of the human side of Jesus, as most ""Jesus movies"" depict only his divine characteristics.  I was sadly disappointed.  More than human, this fictional story of Christ depicted him as a weak, sniveling, reluctant messiah lead by the nose by an overbearing Judas.  The Jesus of the Gospels, though not thrilled at the thought of his crucifixion, was not  reluctant to teach, to lead.  As a child, he taught in the synagogue.  Scorsese's Jesus (I know Kazantzakis wrote the book on which the film is based) was not only lacking any sign of divinity, but was nothing anyone of the day would have called a ""Rabbi.""I know that I will get blasted for this review and get a lot of ""not helpful"" votes.

I'd rented it when it hit video years ago but, to be honest, I fell asleep and never saw the whole thing.  As controversial as it was, it was never involving.  Or all that interesting.I loved GOODFELLAS, TAXI DRIVER, CASINO and even CAPE FEAR, but it's painfully obvious that Scorsese had no idea who Jesus Christ was and what he was here for.That Scorsese believed that audiences wouldn't be offended at the sight of Christ having sexual relations with a woman shows how little he understands faith.  Just showing him married with children would've made the point, wouldn't it?But that's another problem with this movie: the Last Temptation sequence felt like a whole movie in itself.  In fact, the movie would've been much more interesting--and disorienting--if it started at the beginning of the Last Temptation.  Jesus as a normal man.  Who realizes that this wasn't what he was here for.Other odd choices, like having Jesus the carpenter build crosses for the Romans, now come off as more obnoxious than offensive.  Showing the Zealots ""making a hit"" and ""whacking"" Lazarus would work in MEAN STREETS, but in the First Century it felt awkward and even unnecessary (and did Scorsese have to play Lazarus as if he was a pasty zombie?).There are some arresting images but the movie loses steam early on and never recovers.  Seeing Harvey Keitel and Harry Dean Stanton as biblical characters stays weird for the whole movie.  The Peter Gabriel music and Moroccan locales are good.Scorsese was free to ""explore his interpretation"" of the life of Jesus, but that didn't mean that everyone had to like it.(For everyone complaining about how the religious community is so negative and narrow-minded, let me ask you this: do you think Scorsese would even be alive today if he'd made THE LAST TEMPTATION OF MOHAMMED?)",1,The Last Really Loooong Temptation of Christ,1131580800,"11 10, 2005",2005,1882,"['finally', 'watched', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'recently', ""'d"", 'rented', 'when', 'hit', 'video', 'years', 'ago', 'be', 'honest', 'fell', 'asleep', 'never', 'saw', 'whole', 'thing', 'As', 'controversial', 'was', 'was', 'never', 'involving', 'loved', 'GOODFELLAS', 'TAXI', 'DRIVER', 'CASINO', 'even', 'CAPE', 'FEAR', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Scorsese', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'here', 'for.That', 'Scorsese', 'believed', 'audiences', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'offended', 'sight', 'Christ', 'having', 'sexual', 'relations', 'woman', 'how', 'little', 'faith', 'Just', 'showing', 'married', 'children', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'point', 'would', ""n't"", 'problem', 'movie', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'sequence', 'felt', 'whole', 'movie', 'fact', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'disorienting', 'started', 'beginning', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Jesus', 'normal', 'man', 'Who', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'here', 'for.Other', 'odd', 'choices', 'having', 'Jesus', 'carpenter', 'build', 'crosses', 'Romans', 'now', 'come', 'off', 'more', 'obnoxious', 'offensive', 'Showing', 'Zealots', 'making', 'hit', 'whacking', 'Lazarus', 'would', 'work', 'MEAN', 'STREETS', 'First', 'Century', 'felt', 'awkward', 'even', 'unnecessary', 'did', 'Scorsese', 'have', 'play', 'Lazarus', 'was', 'pasty', 'zombie', 'are', 'arresting', 'images', 'movie', 'steam', 'early', 'never', 'recovers', 'Seeing', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'biblical', 'characters', 'stays', 'weird', 'whole', 'movie', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'music', 'Moroccan', 'locales', 'are', 'good.Scorsese', 'was', 'free', 'explore', 'interpretation', 'life', 'Jesus', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'everyone', 'had', 'everyone', 'complaining', 'how', 'religious', 'community', 'so', 'negative', 'narrow-minded', 'let', 'ask', 'do', 'think', 'Scorsese', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'alive', 'today', ""'d"", 'made', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'OF', 'MOHAMMED']",N/A

182544,A2NVICA0FCP9ES,1559409037,"Vader ""SG""","[29, 115]","This is the most ridiculous trashing of the Gospels that I have seen to date. Jesus WAS tempted, but He never entertained the temptations. Either in His heart, His head or with His physical being. Jesus was very clear about this when He Himself declared that it is sin to even commit adultery in your heart. That is...that if you merely dwell on and entertain the idea of committing adultery, you have already done it in your heart. This movie does nothing but portray Jesus the Messiah as an indecisive, nervous and unsure of himself individual who would just as soon fornicate (that's to have sex outside of marriage) with Mary Magdalene than go to the cross as God the Father predestined it to be before time as we know it even began. Jesus WAS fully human AND fully God. It is not inaccurate to acknowledge Jesus' humanity in the sense that He felt pain, He felt sorrow, and He felt loss and even anger. In His humanity he asked the Father if there was any way for the cup of suffering to pass and that man could be saved in any other way, that it would pass. But He is the only One whose blood would suffice for the sins of mankind. He was born to die, and was resurrected to fulfill the prophecies of the Old Testament and sits now at the right hand of God in intercession for all of us until He returns in judgement. Scorcese has succeeded in making a pitiful misinterpretation of who Jesus is and what His life during those 33 years on earth were all about. And to the one who was a ""protester-turned-praiser""...maybe you ought to go back and read the Gospel and edit your review. His 3 decades here was NOT the only life He had known. He IS God, and ""before Abraham was, I AM."" That's what makes His death on the cross and the torture He endured that day so much more than any man has suffered.

182545,AU5SQBPSNOIM,1559409037,"Vanissa W. Chan ""vandelist""","[7, 18]","I was looking through this huge pile of previously viewed films, and immediately, right when I was about to give up, this caught my eye.  I had heard about this film when I was a child, and had heard mostly bad things about it.  As a Christian about to become Catholic, I've grown a strong interest in the wide interpretations of what Christ was like as a living man on Earth.  After viewing a very respectable and divine portrayal played by Max von Sydow in The Greatest Story Ever Told, I was ready to see the exact opposite.....And ohhh...was it the EXACT OPPOSITE!  In the first 10 minutes I was considering shutting it off and dismissing it as pure carnage and blasphemy, but I stuck with it through to the end, and I'm satisfied that I did.  If this movie wasn't the story of Christ (even though it is well-stated in the beginning that the film was not scriptually based), I would have given it five stars easy.  However, the fact that it &quot;was,&quot; or atleast loosely based on the story of Christ, I had to knock of a few stars for theological and moral purposes.This is not the story of Christ, and is a complete perversion of it.  While I understand Scorsese's angle of portraying the more &quot;human side&quot; of Christ, the patheticness and and indecisiveness of Christ played by Dafoe is just.....disgusting.  I refuse to believe that Christ was a half-dazed, confused, self-focused, WEAK, uncertain, and cowardly man.  Scorsese goes a little overboard with the human side, painting Christ as a man whose soul is haunted by desire like some impoverished Dostoevsky or Nabokov character.  He seems to forget that Christ was also the Son of God, and that that was an essential part, if not more so, of the Savior.  Furthermore, the portrayal of Judas Iscariot is laughable (his confidence should have been Jesus's) and horribly inaccurate.  Mary of Magdalene's relations with Jesus were pure speculation, and can be easily dismissed as a lie.  Some of the other shock value scenes (when Jesus goes to meet John and all the people at Jordan are all lost in a epileptic funk) I could have probably done without as well.  Again, this is NOT the story of Christ, and I completely understand any hatred other Christians have for this film -- it is justified.After accepting that, the message of the film was clear -- complacency is a dangerous sin that many of us commit without even knowing it.  One thing I truly appreciated was the subtlety of Satan's tricks, especially the last temptation.  How many times have we asked in our lives, how to take the easy way out?  How many times have we worked things out so that we may live off the fat of the land, be lazy, indulge in our lusts and gluttonous desires?  The humanness of this film is astounding and awakening.  This is a story testing and challenging our way of life, and our desires to be &quot;comfortable,&quot; and denying the path that would truly bring us glory simply because we view it as too difficult of a journey, too much work, too much stress.The last temptation is by far, the best part of the film.  While I was confused the whole time and wondering, &quot;where the heck is this going,&quot; (Scorsese has the ability to do that in any of his films) when the answer was presented, I sighed a big, &quot;Ohhh...&quot;  and immediately thought of The Devil's Advocate and how the two endings parallel.  This is a challenging film that carries a powerful message to all of us who know that we can become so great, but because we are lazy, our potential is made to be wasted by our own will.  God's path is clear, and it includes all that is suffering, all that is pain, and all that is work -- all for His greater Glory.  It is a one-way street.  Satan's path is all others - anything to lead us astray from God, and he has many many many angles he can tempt us with and fool us with.An important film, especially for the Christian, who is not searching for an accurate portrayal of Christ, but who is constantly fighting spiritual battles within -- to take the harder path and achieve great things in God's name, or to take the easier path and result in complacency.",3,"Blasphemous as the story of Christ, JUST as the story of US",1004659200,"11 2, 2001",2001,4150,"['was', 'looking', 'huge', 'pile', 'previously', 'viewed', 'films', 'immediately', 'right', 'when', 'was', 'about', 'give', 'up', 'caught', 'eye', 'had', 'heard', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'had', 'heard', 'mostly', 'bad', 'things', 'Christian', 'become', 'Catholic', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'strong', 'interest', 'wide', 'interpretations', 'what', 'Christ', 'was', 'living', 'man', 'Earth', 'viewing', 'very', 'respectable', 'divine', 'portrayal', 'played', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'Greatest', 'Story', 'Ever', 'Told', 'was', 'ready', 'see', 'exact', 'opposite', '..And', 'ohhh', 'was', 'EXACT', 'OPPOSITE', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'considering', 'shutting', 'off', 'dismissing', 'pure', 'carnage', 'blasphemy', 'stuck', 'end', ""'m"", 'satisfied', 'did', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'story', 'Christ', 'even', 'well-stated', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'scriptually', 'based', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'easy', 'However', 'fact', 'quot', 'was', 'quot', 'atleast', 'loosely', 'based', 'story', 'Christ', 'had', 'knock', 'few', 'stars', 'theological', 'moral', 'purposes.This', 'not', 'story', 'Christ', 'complete', 'perversion', 'understand', 'Scorsese', 'angle', 'portraying', 'more', 'quot', 'human', 'side', 'quot', 'Christ', 'patheticness', 'indecisiveness', 'Christ', 'played', 'Dafoe', 'just', '..disgusting', 'refuse', 'believe', 'Christ', 'was', 'half-dazed', 'confused', 'self-focused', 'WEAK', 'uncertain', 'cowardly', 'man', 'Scorsese', 'little', 'overboard', 'human', 'side', 'painting', 'Christ', 'man', 'soul', 'haunted', 'desire', 'impoverished', 'Dostoevsky', 'Nabokov', 'character', 'forget', 'Christ', 'was', 'also', 'Son', 'God', 'was', 'essential', 'part', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'Savior', 'Furthermore', 'portrayal', 'Judas', 'Iscariot', 'laughable', 'confidence', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Jesus', 'horribly', 'inaccurate', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'relations', 'Jesus', 'were', 'pure', 'speculation', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'dismissed', 'lie', 'other', 'shock', 'value', 'scenes', 'when', 'Jesus', 'meet', 'John', 'people', 'Jordan', 'are', 'lost', 'epileptic', 'funk', 'could', 'have', 'probably', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'Again', 'NOT', 'story', 'Christ', 'completely', 'understand', 'hatred', 'other', 'Christians', 'have', 'film', 'justified.After', 'accepting', 'message', 'film', 'was', 'clear', 'complacency', 'dangerous', 'sin', 'many', 'commit', 'even', 'knowing', 'One', 'thing', 'truly', 'appreciated', 'was', 'subtlety', 'Satan', 'tricks', 'especially', 'last', 'temptation', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'asked', 'lives', 'how', 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'worked', 'things', 'out', 'so', 'may', 'live', 'off', 'fat', 'land', 'be', 'lazy', 'indulge', 'lusts', 'gluttonous', 'desires', 'humanness', 'film', 'astounding', 'awakening', 'story', 'testing', 'challenging', 'way', 'life', 'desires', 'be', 'quot', 'comfortable', 'quot', 'denying', 'path', 'would', 'truly', 'bring', 'glory', 'simply', 'view', 'too', 'difficult', 'journey', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'too', 'much', 'stress.The', 'last', 'temptation', 'far', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'confused', 'whole', 'time', 'wondering', 'quot', 'where', 'heck', 'going', 'quot', 'Scorsese', 'ability', 'do', 'films', 'when', 'answer', 'was', 'presented', 'sighed', 'big', 'quot', 'Ohhh', 'quot', 'immediately', 'thought', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'how', 'two', 'endings', 'parallel', 'challenging', 'film', 'powerful', 'message', 'who', 'know', 'can', 'become', 'so', 'great', 'are', 'lazy', 'potential', 'made', 'be', 'wasted', 'own', 'will', 'God', 'path', 'clear', 'suffering', 'pain', 'work', 'greater', 'Glory', 'one-way', 'street', 'Satan', 'path', 'others', 'anything', 'lead', 'astray', 'God', 'many', 'many', 'many', 'angles', 'can', 'tempt', 'fool', 'with.An', 'important', 'film', 'especially', 'Christian', 'who', 'not', 'searching', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'Christ', 'who', 'constantly', 'fighting', 'spiritual', 'battles', 'take', 'harder', 'path', 'achieve', 'great', 'things', 'God', 'name', 'take', 'easier', 'path', 'result', 'complacency']",N/A

In this film Jesus is shown the way to righteousness by Judas! That is right, according to this junk God needed His betrayer to guide Him to righteousness. A Clever way to put God under humanities authority. It parallels nicely with the atheist perspective of science over God. Jesus marries Mary Magdalen after being taken down off the cross whom then dies. He is then told that ALL women are Mary. (just imagine the suggestion that makes) Jesus is of course a father who remarries to produce more children. At the end after being shown the light by Judas He than crawls back on to the cross.

Flanagan,"[11, 18]","As a fan of Martin Scorsese and a recovering ex-Liberal, I just had to buy this film when it first came to video and a certain major  chain of rental outlets refused to stock it because of the attendant controversy.  It was my own form of ""protest"" against those narrow-minded Christians who would ""censor"" the film because it dared challenge the orthodoxy.Now, years later, I can see what my own bias at the time blinded me to:  The Last Temptation of Christ, while technically stunning, is largely a bore.  While it's possible to be too ""reverent"", like the Biblical epics of the past, this film proves that the opposite is also true.  It's own ""progressive"" take on the life of Jesus pigeonholes it as a piece of era-specific social propoganda every bit as dated in its own way as Cecil B. DeMill's hoary old epics.  Its New Age Jesus seems as goofy now as Healing Crystals or pyramid power.The controversial sex scene involving Jesus and Mary Magdalene became the focus of a frenzied protest by Christian Conservatives.  They actually ended up giving the film a brief bump at the box office because of knee-jerk Liberals like me.  They would have been better off actually seeing the film, first; then they would have realized what a short shelf-life it really had.  The taboo coupling was not even offensive, since - HELLO! - it happened in a vision - a fantasy - as Satan tempted Jesus on the cross (which, by the way, is Biblical).No, worse than offensive, The Last Temptation of Christ is just plain talky and dreadfully self-important.  The rush by largely left-wing critics to call it a brilliant masterpiece was reactionary and wrong-headed.For vintage Scorsese, you can do no better than Taxi Driver, or Raging Bull - films where action, camera work, dialog, and performances meld in a uniquely energetic style that communicates much more than mere words.  Those films, with their painfully vivid depths, serve as better windows on the human soul, its capacity for sin, and its hope for redemption.When it comes to films about Jesus, Franco Zefferelli's Jesus of Nazareth is no masterpiece either.

Here, he takes the full plunge, and creates a movie so forcefully personal that any viewer will be hard-pressed not to be deeply affected.  By adapting the Kazantzakis novel instead of the actual Gospel itself, Scorsese has allowed himself a little more artistic leeway, which lends the film more power.  Scorsese has not, as he has been accused of, made a sacreligious movie that insults the image of Christ.
