994366,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B000FS2VU4,A. Schneider,"[10, 14]","Simply one of the very best anime series, Gunslinger Girl is not only an exciting action-packed modern sci-fi adventure, but an engrossing drama about love and companionship. Go ahead and rent or purchase the first DVD today to get started on a short-but-sweet tale about humanity done anime style!The production quality of this DVD (and of this series as a whole) is extremely high and might be a shock to the avid anime enthusiast. The quality this anime exhibits is rare for a series that (while it is known among anime fans), isn't generally as popular as other similar shorts. Gunslinger pulls the quality factor over the top by combining amazingly beautiful visuals (flawless shading and the like) with a terrific soundtrack. Sound effects and music are breathtaking as is the delightful English voice acting.The series itself has been reviewed dozens of times by anime fans so I'll spare everyone my summarization of it. What matters most of all though is that the themes mentioned earlier - those of endearment and love - are strengthened by a superb script, character development, and images presented on screen. Very often 3-to-4 disc series are condescended and more often than not of lower story quality than the 7 disc series, that is not the case with Gunslinger Girl.Action sequences are - for a series which has good dramatic elements - amazing to say the least. Usually in anime series you sacrifice one for the other: fast paced action sequences are typically precursors to a really bad story (see Chrono Crusade or Requiem for the Darkness, which, to be honest isn't exactly fast paced either but some fans of the series think Requiem is). Gunslinger Girl goes beyond all that with a mature storyline in combination with kick butt action sequences that will leave you on the edge of your seat.Some people wish the series was longer but ""as is"" Gunslinger Girl is truly a terrific anime and well worth owning. I'm giving it 5 stars because it deserves it. Certainly there are more complex animes like the 7 disc Samurai Champloo which earns 5 stars in my book, but this series deserves each of the 5 stars for presentation and story.",5,"Action, visuals, story A+ Great Anime!",1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,2151,"['Simply', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'anime', 'series', 'Gunslinger', 'Girl', 'not', 'only', 'exciting', 'action-packed', 'modern', 'sci-fi', 'adventure', 'engrossing', 'drama', 'love', 'companionship', 'Go', 'ahead', 'rent', 'purchase', 'first', 'DVD', 'today', 'get', 'started', 'short-but-sweet', 'tale', 'humanity', 'done', 'anime', 'style', 'production', 'quality', 'DVD', 'series', 'whole', 'extremely', 'high', 'might', 'be', 'shock', 'avid', 'anime', 'enthusiast', 'quality', 'anime', 'rare', 'series', 'known', 'anime', 'fans', ""n't"", 'generally', 'as', 'popular', 'other', 'similar', 'shorts', 'Gunslinger', 'quality', 'factor', 'top', 'combining', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'flawless', 'shading', 'like', 'terrific', 'soundtrack', 'Sound', 'effects', 'music', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'delightful', 'English', 'voice', 'acting.The', 'series', 'been', 'reviewed', 'dozens', 'times', 'anime', 'fans', 'so', ""'ll"", 'spare', 'everyone', 'summarization', 'What', 'most', 'though', 'themes', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'endearment', 'love', 'are', 'strengthened', 'superb', 'script', 'character', 'development', 'images', 'presented', 'screen', 'Very', 'often', '3-to-4', 'disc', 'series', 'are', 'condescended', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'lower', 'story', 'quality', '7', 'disc', 'series', 'not', 'case', 'Gunslinger', 'Girl.Action', 'sequences', 'are', 'series', 'good', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'amazing', 'say', 'least', 'Usually', 'anime', 'series', 'sacrifice', 'one', 'other', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'typically', 'precursors', 'really', 'bad', 'story', 'see', 'Chrono', 'Crusade', 'Requiem', 'Darkness', 'be', 'honest', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fast', 'paced', 'fans', 'series', 'think', 'Requiem', 'Gunslinger', 'Girl', 'mature', 'storyline', 'combination', 'kick', 'butt', 'action', 'sequences', 'will', 'leave', 'edge', 'seat.Some', 'people', 'wish', 'series', 'was', 'longer', 'Gunslinger', 'Girl', 'truly', 'terrific', 'anime', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', ""'m"", 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'Certainly', 'are', 'more', 'complex', 'animes', '7', 'disc', 'Samurai', 'Champloo', '5', 'stars', 'book', 'series', '5', 'stars', 'presentation', 'story']",N/A

994371,A2WM45XB3302MU,B000FS2VU4,"Dressi ""K N D""","[53, 56]","It's a glorious yet calm look into the lives of girls who are cyborg assassins.  The interactions between them in their every day lives and the relationships they have with their brothers/trainers.  It's very different.Art style: realistic, think Ghost in the Shell.  no oversized or exaggerated expressions/body parts.  A lot of attention to details (except in like the first scene there is a moment where you go ""nah . . ."").Setting: modern, set in Italy.Violence level: high.  Shows children shooting guns and killing people.  The violent scenes do not play an integral part of the story.  Has blood.Theme: what is it to be normal?Pros: Realistic themes with a deep exploration of the character's emotions, motivations and reactions.  How well would you survive being a little girl ""forced"" to shoot guns and kill people?  Could you be normal?Cons: Action wise, suspense wise, plot twisting wise, mysterious question answering wise . . . it fails to deliver.  It is subdued and quiet, a sort of ""peaceful"" anime without a huge hook or a glorious finale.  It leaves you with many questions.  This anime just ""IS,"" Ivan Denisovich style even.Yeah, so girls with guns.  The back read something about them being cyborgs from a secret agency.  Ok, so then a cliched plot entered my mind: they are generally silent, innocent looking girls that can kick some major butt, and then there'll be a huge conspiracy with their agency and they end up having to fight to discover the truth and to make it out alive.Boy, that was WRONG!  (in a good way)  And that doesn't give away the plot.  Why? Because there really isn't a plot.  There is no main enemy, no big conspiracy, no end objective in the entire three disks.  There is NO unifying force that the girls are united against . . . tagible force that is.The series is about these girls who were terminal patients or victims.  They were restored back to life through bioengineering, cybernetics and a lot of weapons training . . . and they were made into assassins.  However, the series does not focus on their missions, the action or the combat.  In fact, such scenes are kinda there because they have to be.  Rather, the drive of the series is the interaction between the girls and between the girl and their handler, or ""brother.""  Each handler is different with his girl, treating her differently, conditioning them differently.  It's this relationship between the young girl and her handler that makes the series move.  Each episode is a little more about the girl and how she and her handler interact.[Disk 1]The first DVD introduces the main characters in 5 episodes (though it does not introduce Angelica to a good range, just mentions her name).  The first two episodes are hard to follow as they jump back and forth between scenes happening at different times, or the same scene again from another light or the same scene from another character's perspective.  It basically introduces Henrietta, Rico, Triela and Claes, in that order.  I ended the first DVD feeling very good about it, having the protagonists' introductions out of the way, and feeling as if the action was about to pick up a lot.[Disk 2]The second DVD did not do that . . . but neither did it disappoint.  It is further development about the girls and their handlers.  It has a little more action, but not by a great deal.  We get introduced to the last two characters and their handlers: Angelica and Marco, Elsa and Lauro.  The first half of the DVD deals with RF bombers in which the main three fratello are involved.  Next is a look at Rico.  The last two episodes deal with the last two girls introduced, and the stark differences between the fratello of Elsa and Lauro and of Henrietta and Jose.[Disk 3]It's not a complicated DVD to watch because it doesn't really DO anything spectacular, though it starts off with a surprise.  The first two episodes focus on Henrietta and Jose as they are on ""vacation"" after an incident.  The latter two episdoes have a focus partly on Angelica.  The last episode is about all the girls.  In the end of the DVD it just finally develops the girls.  It would not be a spoiler to say that the ending is rather subdued.  The ending is not one of great climax or incredible revelation; it just simply is, realistically and tenderly.  It doesn't answer many of the questions you might have.  In fact it leaves you sort of wanting and wishing that there were more.  For some, it could easily leave you feeling like you've wasted your money.[Over all]Basically . . . it's 13 episodes of getting to know these girls.  Yes, they are cyborg assassins working for a secret government agency in Italy, but the focus is not on the action, not on the missions or the secrecy or the conspiracies or the shadow of their pasts coming back to haunt them.  It is about their present lives, how they are handling it, how real they actually are and what kind of lives they live.  It really is interesting, though i'd honestly have to say that it could really be boring.  I'm very interested in stories and character interactions.  The concept of the anime is about the girls' relationships with each other and their handlers, not about their action sequences.  Therefore, it can easily leave someone with many questions, a sense of disatisfaction or worse.  As well, it has a smaller amount of dialogue than most other anime.  The moments of silence reminded me of that uncomfortable moment in Evangelion in the elevator.  Though there are action sequences, they seem to only be there to reinforce something about the relationships between the girls and their handlers.Finally, I liked the anime.  I thought it was very different from what I originally percieved it to be, and so it was a nice surprise later on as I got to understand what it was about.  I love the characters and could sympathize with them.  It is definitely not an action anime and I can't really think of any other anime to compare it to.  Perhaps best compared to Now and Then, Here and There.I would recommend this to people who like characters, because that's honestly what it's all about.  It is very subdued, realistic and without just about any plot twists.  If you're a fan of big action or comedy, like most other anime out there, and not open to watching Ghost in the Shell without the action sequences, then I would not recommend this.  I would not recommend it to children.  It's rather mature in its topics, not to the point of sexually mature or violently mature, just that the concepts and ideas are complex, requiring the ability to relate to the characters somewhat and understand their individual situations.  This is not going to be your typical anime.  It's quiet for the most part and it's calm for the most part.What this anime really needs is a better title.""[I hated them at first, half carbon and fiber optics.  But when you get to know them they're just normal little girls, running the gambit of emotions, seeking approval, unsure of their adolescent feelings . . . and can't cook worth a darn.]""",5,The days

I am talking ""horror"" as in, say, Shirley Jackson's short story ""The Lottery"", where the horror is implicit in the basic premise -- of young girls resurrected, rebuilt, and used as tools by a desperate government.As such, it is a quiet series that is intelligent and surprisingly character-oriented. It is also deeply moving in places. This is not some shallow action flick with cardboard characters that are moved around like drawings on celluloid, this is a deep and troubling series that especially in these times is worth viewing. Does the ends justify the means? Whether it is waterboarding a suspected terrorist or using a little girl as an anti-terror weapon, that's a question that is worth thinking about in these times of terrorism and fear.

994375,A3E68QNSCABRVW,B000FS2VU4,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[3, 3]","I saw a preview for this on another Anime I had watched and I was instantly intrigued by its premise.  ""Gunslinger Girl"" just looked phenomenal and action packed.  On the back of one of the DVD's it said ""Anime's answer to `The Professional'..."" by Rob Bricken, a reviewer at Anime Insider.  Needless to say this definitely caught my attention.  ""The Professional"" is one of my favorite films with an absolutely phenomenal story.""Gunslinger Girl"" definitely poses a very controversial concept, but that's what makes it very good.  The show takes place in Italy and primarily centers on the story of a little girl named Henrietta.  The premise is based around a top secret government organization that is part of the Social Welfare Agency.  It's not about giving children new homes; it's about giving terminally ill patients a new chance at life.  The one catch is that, regardless of the fact they're children, they have to become super assassins for the government.  The children are given new cybernetic bodies to accomplish these seemingly inhuman feats for children.  However, despite these enhancements they are still children and they need extensive training, as well as re-learning how to use their new bodies.  Although not everything on a girl is replaced as we later learn with Triela.  Each girl is teamed up with a handler (together called a fratello (siblings)) who is responsible for training her in combat and supervising her on missions.  This is where that whole line of ethics becomes heavily blurred.  I know some people will dismiss the idea of training children to be assassins as just plain wrong.  But the fact remains that without the agencies interference they would be dead.  Not to mention these super assassins are fighting against terrorists that would further harm other innocents.  It's not like they're taking little girls that could live normal lives, they are taking those that are already damaged beyond repair.  The only part that makes me curious is the girls undergo something called ""conditioning"" to increase their obedience and docility to their handlers.  It also makes them forget their tragic past.  They really didn't get into the details of what they do or what its effects are.  The handlers have the ability to choose how much conditioning a girl receives, which brings us into the ethics of their trainers.Henrietta is the girl we get to know best, along with her handler Jos&eacute;.  You really do like this pair, because they seem to compliment each other quite well.  Jos&eacute; treats Henrietta like a little sister and truly does care about her feelings.  He wants her to be happy in her new chance at life.  Not all trainers are like Jos&eacute; though.  Jean, on the other hand, is very demanding of Rico, but Rico seems to deal with this personal strife better than some could imagine and she's fiercely loyal to Jean.  Triela and her handler have sort of an understanding, she's the oldest and most self sufficient, but she still wants her handler to be proud of her and he's happy keeping his distance.  Not everything works out this well for a fratello, because in the case of Angelica and Marco things are not going so well.  There seems to be some serious memory flaws because of the implants (Angelica was the prototype) and Marco has a very difficult time dealing with helping this child overcome her problems and then her forgetting.  The worst case scenario is probably Elsa and her handler.  He is so uncaring and cold to her that it just feels wrong; to him she is just a tool.  You intrinsically know that regardless of the fact that they are cyborgs, they are still children and need nurturing.  They need to feel like they're accomplishing something.  Most of the girls are very grateful for a new chance at life and genuinely enjoy what they do.  They even know they have been conditioned and sometimes question whether it's their brain washing talking or it's the real them.As you can see I thought the story concept was brilliant.  You go through all kinds of episodes dealing with different missions and different teams.  Primarily we see Henrietta and her story, but you get to see what happens with all the other girls I mentioned, as well as Claes, who has a very interesting story.  You see their handlers deal with the problems of having to essentially raise children and how they go about doing this.  A lot of them can't treat their girls like any other weapon, it's tough to do that, especially when it speaks and you know there is a conscious mind behind the words!  I do wish there was more of a central story to the whole series though.  Watching the missions and getting to know the characters was really great, but at the end it just ended.  There wasn't a huge blow out ending or anything.  It makes me hope that they write another series in this universe with these girls, this one just feels so introductory.I thought this was a very good series and I would definitely recommend it to just about anyone.  Just don't expect it to be all action, like I had initially thought.  It really is more like ""The Professional"" when I think about it because that dealt a lot with the issues and emotions of training a child in the art of assassination.  One thing I do commend ""Gunslinger Girl"" for doing is making all the weapons real.  It's funny because I recognized a lot of the guns from the video game Counter Strike, so it makes me wonder if there was some influence there!  In the end I have to say my favorite character was Triela.  I really thought she was the most interesting character in some ways because it felt like she had the most personality and she was also playing the big sister role.  I do wish this series delved more into the technology, because they referenced that the cyborgs lived a shorter life-span, but they never say how short that is, or if they are working on technology to increase that.  In the end I am left with a lot of questions and wanting more episodes, so maybe someone will read this and make more in the spirit of this first installment.  This set comes in three normally sized DVD cases complete with a slipcase to package all three.

994376,A16KRCLLTHSB5F,B000FS2VU4,Henry Platte,"[18, 18]","It's been pointed out already that Gunslinger Girl is a highly atypical anime. This isn't only because of its overall tone (a number of bright, cheerful, high-energy titles like Love Hina, Fruits Basket and Mahoromatic tend to overshadow more serious work) or its visual and narrative style (whereas many titles make use of animation to create exaggerated poses, expressions and action sequences, Gunslinger Girl could be filmed live with little alteration) but because it is, purely and simply, a work of art--it has a coherency of style, theme and purpose that very few other titlesa can match.  With no slight to series that are, first and foremost, entertaining (like the aforemnentioned Love Hina), Gunslinger Girl attempts to do something much more difficult than entertain, and succeeds.If that sounds obtuse: GG has more in common with most great films and novels than with other anime series. Even those that are dramatic and violent generally rely on visceral thrills, and the few, like Neon Gensis Evangelion and Serial Experiment Lain, that seem to have a ""higher"" artistic purpose, often fall short in the final reckoning (does anybody really understand these two titles?).Visually, GG is extremely simple. The majority of the characters are either built on the model of a figure-less prepubescent girl or a middle-aged man in a suit, and except for the sequences of violence (which, it should be noticed, are rarer than it might at first seem) many shots are composed of characters standing around and talking in plain uninflected voices. (Side note: There is some hysterical audio commentary on these discs. On one of them, one of the voice actors playing a handler says to another: ""Yo, I think we should talk like this in real life. [gruff, flat] ""Hey, I think we should go out for a pizza. How does that sound?""""Roger, copy that."") The animation is still of a very high quality in the action sequences, but the attention is drawn away from the visuals and to the story.Hopefully there's no need to restate the series' presence. What should be stated, though, is that the series is not about violence, or social problems, but overwhelmingly about love. The basic horror or the premise--that small girls are brainwashed and forced to commit political murders--is almost taken for granted by the final episode; the way that people treat each other and their affections are of much greater importance, and ultimately far more horrifying. Violence is a visceral expression of wounded human emotions, and it's no accident that the series is soundtracked by the sublimely depressing ""Hate"" (The Delgados)--songs about longing and loneliness, but on examination, perfectly suited to this world.All this is just to say that Gunslinger Girl should be taken for what it is: a singular work with a specific style and a dogmatic theme. It has very little in the way of entertainment (although there are a few funny moments), sexiness, violent kicks or uplifting morals about how, if you believe in yourself, you can get into Tokyo U. It may not be to everyone's taste, but I would highly recommend it both to anime fans and also to those who might never watch another anime title, but want to see something of chilling, heartbreaking emotional power.",5,"""If I were in love with someone, and I knew that person would never feel the same way about me...""",1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,3255,"['been', 'pointed', 'out', 'already', 'Gunslinger', 'Girl', 'highly', 'atypical', 'anime', ""n't"", 'only', 'overall', 'tone', 'number', 'bright', 'cheerful', 'high-energy', 'titles', 'Love', 'Hina', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'Mahoromatic', 'tend', 'overshadow', 'more', 'serious', 'work', 'visual', 'narrative', 'style', 'many', 'titles', 'make', 'use', 'animation', 'create', 'exaggerated', 'poses', 'expressions', 'action', 'sequences', 'Gunslinger', 'Girl', 'could', 'be', 'filmed', 'live', 'little', 'alteration', 'purely', 'simply', 'work', 'art', 'coherency', 'style', 'theme', 'purpose', 'very', 'few', 'other', 'titlesa', 'can', 'match', 'slight', 'series', 'are', 'first', 'foremost', 'entertaining', 'aforemnentioned', 'Love', 'Hina', 'Gunslinger', 'Girl', 'attempts', 'do', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'entertain', 'succeeds.If', 'obtuse', 'GG', 'more', 'common', 'most', 'great', 'films', 'novels', 'other', 'anime', 'series', 'Even', 'are', 'dramatic', 'violent', 'generally', 'rely', 'visceral', 'thrills', 'few', 'Neon', 'Gensis', 'Evangelion', 'Serial', 'Experiment', 'Lain', 'seem', 'have', 'higher', 'artistic', 'purpose', 'often', 'fall', 'short', 'final', 'reckoning', 'anybody', 'really', 'understand', 'two', 'titles', '.Visually', 'GG', 'extremely', 'simple', 'majority', 'characters', 'are', 'either', 'built', 'model', 'figure-less', 'prepubescent', 'girl', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'suit', 'sequences', 'violence', 'should', 'be', 'noticed', 'are', 'rarer', 'might', 'first', 'seem', 'many', 'shots', 'are', 'composed', 'characters', 'standing', 'around', 'talking', 'plain', 'uninflected', 'voices', 'Side', 'note', 'hysterical', 'audio', 'commentary', 'discs', 'one', 'one', 'voice', 'actors', 'playing', 'handler', 'Yo', 'think', 'should', 'talk', 'real', 'life', '[', 'gruff', 'flat', ']', 'Hey', 'think', 'should', 'go', 'out', 'pizza', 'How', 'sound', 'Roger', 'copy', 'animation', 'still', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'action', 'sequences', 'attention', 'drawn', 'away', 'visuals', 'story.Hopefully', 'need', 'restate', 'series', 'presence', 'What', 'should', 'be', 'stated', 'series', 'not', 'violence', 'social', 'problems', 'overwhelmingly', 'love', 'basic', 'horror', 'premise', 'small', 'girls', 'are', 'brainwashed', 'forced', 'commit', 'political', 'murders', 'almost', 'taken', 'granted', 'final', 'episode', 'way', 'people', 'treat', 'other', 'affections', 'are', 'much', 'greater', 'importance', 'ultimately', 'far', 'more', 'horrifying', 'Violence', 'visceral', 'expression', 'wounded', 'human', 'emotions', 'accident', 'series', 'soundtracked', 'sublimely', 'depressing', 'Hate', 'Delgados', 'songs', 'longing', 'loneliness', 'examination', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'world.All', 'just', 'say', 'Gunslinger', 'Girl', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'what', 'singular', 'work', 'specific', 'style', 'dogmatic', 'theme', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'entertainment', 'are', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'sexiness', 'violent', 'kicks', 'uplifting', 'morals', 'how', 'believe', 'can', 'get', 'Tokyo', 'U', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anime', 'fans', 'also', 'who', 'might', 'never', 'watch', 'anime', 'title', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'chilling', 'heartbreaking', 'emotional', 'power']",N/A

Instead, this agency deals with terrorists, the mob, and other such criminal organizations, by assassinating their leaders.Now meet Harrietta, possibly the cutest little girl in the world, trained by the government to be the perfect killing machine, a weapon of war and destruction, a tool and nothing more. She is the perfect weapon, skilled in her trade, unquestionably devoted to her handler, Josay, able to go unnoticed because of her innocent and harmless appearance. After her parents were brutally murdered she was taken in by the Agency, her memory wiped clean, her organic body replaced with cyborg parts making her very much like Darth Vader from ""Star Wars"" or the Major from ""Ghost in the Shell"". She is a tool to be used and disposed of when her usefulness is done, but at the same time she is still the little girls she once was.Gunslinger Girl is a show that I've been meaning to see for some time now. I've known about it since I started watching anime two years ago, but not until now have I had a chance to actually sit down and watch it. I thought I'd like it, after all sad and depressing anime's like ""Now and Then, Here"" and There"" and ""Grave of the Fireflies"" are among my all time favorites, but I had no idea how completely amazed I'd be with it.Let's get the obvious out of the way; this is one shockingly grotesque show. Think about it, it's about little girls, some maybe as young as ten, being transformed from cute little school children into coldly efficient killing machines. Is there anything more disturbing then seeing a little pre adolescent girl wielding a machine gun and killing at will dozens of people? Is there anything sadder then said girl pleading to be allowed to do so again?""I know I've only killed six people this month, but last month I killed at least twenty, so can't I come back to work?""Although this show relies on its action and disturbing content early on to draw the viewer into the story, it doesn't dwell on it throughout the shows entirety. It isn't about the gun slinging at all, it's about the gunslingers and their handlers. None of the characters are wasted, especially the cyborg girls, each of whom received adequate detail to their characters and plenty of history. Herrietta, Triela, Ricko, Clide, Angelica, even the reclusive and barley mentioned Elsa (who looks a lot like Sara from ""Now and Then, Here and There"") were treated with just enough love and care to make their characters more then killing machines and into confused, emotional, and caring little girls simply doing their best to please those they love and feel needed. Their stories are the real meaning for this shows existence. One was born paralyzed; another was nearly killed by her parents who needed the insurance money. One by one their stories unfold. Each character has at least one episode devoted to them with Harrietta acting as the sometimes silent, sometimes active observer. Unlike other shows which try this approach, such as ""Air TV"", these characters aren't dropped once they've produced the desired emotional effect. They all have a part to play in this story; each one relies on the others in order for the show to move forward. They need each other. But despite the attention to detail put into each character, in the end its Harrietta's story. She is the common denominator which glues the characters and events to one another.Where the emotional stories lie exclusively with the cyborg girls, the moral, ethical, and philosophical dilemmas are for the ""handlers,"" the men whose job it is to raise, train, supervise, and care for the girls, to deal with, and they are as different from one another as the girls they train. Josay, Harrietta's handler, feels guilty about the dehumanizing conditioning the girls are forced to go though and tries his best to alleviate that guilt by trading Harrietta as a little sister. He takes her on vacations to the Italian countryside, buys her expensive gifts, and tries his best to have her act as if she were a normal little girl. But deep down he knows that he, and the agency he serves, is merely using her as a tool; a means to an end. He deals with this guilt more and more as Herrietta's affection and emotional attachment to him grow stronger. He is a man torn between his duty and his love and affection for her.Other handlers deal with their girls very differently. Some act cold and menacing towards their girls in order to instill fear and discipline, others simply treat then as if they were machines.""They're cool and all; they can get you a soda if you ask them to, but it doesn't go beyond that to me.""No matter what the approach they take, the girls always develop a strong emotional attachment to their handlers and desire their affection above all else, with devastating consequences sometimes.The animation in this show may not be flashy, but it's more then adequate for a show of this nature. The battle scenes are done extremely well, as one would expect, as well as the stunning scenery of Italy. The characters are drawn as cute as possible to make their action all the more shocking. The music isn't worth making a big deal out of. Although the background music serves its purpose and sets the mood very effectively, it isn't something to listen to by itself. It's rather simplistic. The opening and closing songs are likewise less then noteworthy.Gunslinger Girl is not a show to be missed. Although it is very much like Ghost in the Shell in regards to the philosophical questions it raises, the depth of its characters and the attention to detail the creators put into making them is well worth the time, energy, and money. It may not be the best anime ever made, but it certainly is one of them. Good to see a depressing anime that doesn't drop the ball at the end.Questions to ponder while watching.1. Is Josay, Harrietta's handler, a moral person? Is his using Harrietta as a tool negated by the fact that he tries to make her happy? If he makes Harrietta happy, is he still acting immorally by using her, as the agencies pawn, as a tool?2. Are the girls really human? If so, then why? What is it that makes them still human beings?3. Do the ends justify the means? Does the fact that the agency uses these girls to foil potential terrorist plots which could kill innocent people make it right to use these girls as tools and weapons?Replay value;

When I was watching Gunslinger Girl for the first time I also forgot I was watching Anime. The story is powerful and deep and very episode leaves a lingering feeling of melancholy.The show centers around a government agency in Italy combating terrorist using cybernetically enhanced young girls. The story starts with one of the girls and her handler taking out a terrorist cell, but as the story gets underway you see another side to these children that have been turned into killers, yet retain their human feeling. We watch how their sense of morality warps as they are exposed to more and more bloodshed.The beautiful thing about this show is that it isn't just action, nor is it a show that plays on the viewer's emotions.

I was deciding whether to buy it or not and at the end, I ended up buying it for $38 dollars. I got it four days later and i'm really glad i bought this anime.Introduction Of Gunslinger GirlOfficially, the Social Welfare Agency is a government sponsored corporation that's in the business of saving lives. In reality, it's an agency on the fringe of technology. They give terminal patients another shot at life using cybernetic implants. This conditioning process then shapes the patient into an efficient machine for handling all of the government's dirty work.Sum of the Story (No spoilers)A special agency was formed to combat criminals and commit political murders. The agency was called Social Welfare Agency. This is not your regular agency, instead of using well trained officers, they use cybernetics girls. Interesting? The agency will pick little girls who has a tragic accident or their parents died. After the girl is in custody, The handler will name the girl.  The agency will take them, brainwash them, put mechanical parts in the body, train them and making the girls fearless killing assassins. The cyborg girls go through intense training involving shooting practice, cleaning the guns, hand to hand training. Once the training is done, The girls live a normal life like nothing has happen. There are five main characters in the story. The characters are  Henrietta, Claes, Triela, Angelica, and Rico. Each girl has a ""handler"". The handler is a male that commands them to either kill a person, practice their skills of shooting and combat. Also tells them whether to protect them. The girls go through training to become the perfect assassin. Once the girls have a mission, the agency have the girls do their ""dirty work"". The girls are assign to a mission that they need to perform. They have to blend in with the crowd and not make any mistakes. Once they have found thier target, The handler will order the girl to shoot the target at the right moment. The anime doesn't really have a plot. A short plot will be reveal, resolved and then a another plot.The setting takes place in Italy, modern day.The graphics are great and the sound is great. The graphics are amazing, It's 16:9 color which is really good. The color has dark and light shades which gives the characters real look to them and the background. The images of Italy also play great for Gunslinger Girl. The sound of shooting, reloading, cars, people and the music are great. It feels like your watching it first hand and you are their to witness it. It's better if you have surround sound while watching the anime. It's still good if you don't have surround sound. The music also sets the moods for the anime. Whether it's a huge gun fight, or an emotional moment. The detail of the characters is very good and the personality of the characters also shows. The anime shows the personality of the characters right away and the anime also explain what roles they play in the anime. Gunslinger Girl also has a twist to it and an questionable ending. The opening theme and ending theme also stays true to the anime.I would rate this for teens (15+). There is alot of blood and alot of shooting involve. No nudity or sexual content. It's not like Elfen Lied or Divergence Eve (which i recommend watching). The story will involve present and past, so you can watch how the characters develop and also how they got to the agency. I was kinda disappointed on how it ended but some animes want you to question and guess how it ended. I wished it didn't end and it kept on continuing.The case is big, but shouldn't be a probadly putting it somewhere. Comes in three discs and with extras (Trailers, Languages, Commentary, How to draw 3 characters). It's also has opening and ending theme with textless writing. So you can view the opening or the ending theme without the credits.If you like twists, a very good plot, detailed characters, and a questionable ending, this anime is for you!I took a chance with Gunslinger Girl and you should too. Gunslinger Girl is an amazing anime that i was even shocked how good it was. Buy the anime and see for yourself to see how well it is!Second Season of Gunslinger Girl?Yes there is a second season of Gunslinger Girl. It's called Gunslinger Girl IL Teatrino. The downfall is that it's comes out at the end of this year or the begining of 2009. Funanimation license Gunslinger Girl, so expect the graphics to change. Google the Title and you will see the differences between the first and second season.",5,"The girl has a mechanical body.
