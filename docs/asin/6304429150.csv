420721,A3GGSAENATIAW1,6304429150,Ace,"[0, 0]","While ill several weeks ago, this film aired on a local station. It was Sidney Poitier, and in black and white, so I thought I'd give it a shot! I haven't sat still to watch a movie aired on TV in ages! This is another one of those great movies from an era gone too soon, that allows us to piece together an opinion of what's happening instead of telling us what to think! I just love the interaction between Smith and the main nun/missionary; he's adamant he won't do a certain thing, only to be compelled by her monotone stubbornness.The scene in which he gives them an English lesson was one of the finest examples of characters playing off one another. The nuns/missionaries and Smith couldn't have possibly been more different, but here he was teaching them, and they caught on rather quickly!Today, storytelling like this is limited to the so-called Oscar season, and often wasted on films with great concepts but incredibly horrible promotion (not saying the English Patient would've topped the box office, but you get my point). It is my endeavour to get my children exposed to classic films early, since today's modern films are high on flash, but often lacking in substance (you know that sinking feeling you get when you re-watch a modern movie, only to realize you only like maybe 20 minutes of the film).",5,Compelling story and heartwarming message,1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,1317,"['ill', 'several', 'weeks', 'ago', 'film', 'aired', 'local', 'station', 'was', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'black', 'white', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'shot', 'have', ""n't"", 'sat', 'still', 'watch', 'movie', 'aired', 'TV', 'ages', 'one', 'great', 'movies', 'era', 'gone', 'too', 'soon', 'piece', 'together', 'opinion', 'what', 'happening', 'instead', 'telling', 'what', 'think', 'just', 'love', 'interaction', 'Smith', 'main', 'nun/missionary', 'adamant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'certain', 'thing', 'only', 'be', 'compelled', 'monotone', 'stubbornness.The', 'scene', 'English', 'lesson', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'examples', 'characters', 'playing', 'off', 'one', 'nuns/missionaries', 'Smith', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'possibly', 'been', 'more', 'different', 'here', 'was', 'teaching', 'caught', 'rather', 'quickly', 'Today', 'storytelling', 'limited', 'so-called', 'Oscar', 'season', 'often', 'wasted', 'films', 'great', 'concepts', 'incredibly', 'horrible', 'promotion', 'not', 'saying', 'English', 'Patient', 'would', ""'ve"", 'topped', 'box', 'office', 'get', 'point', 'endeavour', 'get', 'children', 'exposed', 'classic', 'films', 'early', 'today', 'modern', 'films', 'are', 'high', 'flash', 'often', 'lacking', 'substance', 'know', 'sinking', 'feeling', 'get', 'when', 're-watch', 'modern', 'movie', 'only', 'realize', 'only', 'maybe', '20', 'minutes', 'film']",N/A

420726,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304429150,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 17]","I'll start this review much like I did with `Harry and Tonto', by being completely honest with you.  I personally feel that Sidney Poitier is an extremely overrated actor.  I find him rather stiff and when he does get into varying displays of emotion he feels forced in my opinion.  I know that this a minority opinion here, but it is mine and I stand behind it firmly.  He reminds me much of Nicolas Cage, very mannered and just the type of actor who does things from the book rather than from the heart.  There is a difference, and that difference is that at least Cage has delivered two very Oscar worthy performances.  Poitier was not so lucky.With that said, if I were Poitier on Oscar night back in 1963 (Oscars would have been held in 1964, but whatever) I would have been ashamed to look out at the audience and see my competitors, Rex Harrison, Albert Finney, Paul Newman and especially Richard Harris and know that I robbed them of an Oscar with a performance that isn't even in the same league as theirs.The film is also quite choppy and much undeserved of the Best Picture nomination it managed to rack up for itself.  It is decent at best, but it never really takes off like it could have.`Lilies of the Field' tells the story of Homer Smith, a traveling handy-man who gets hustled into building a chapel for a group of German nuns he stumbles across in his travels.  The nuns are lead by the very bossy yet very genuine Mother Maria.  She has survived the Nazis and has retained war wounds so-to-speak, but while her interactions with others may seem stern and unsociable she has a tinge of weakness in her voice that plays on her fragility.  Homer is apposed to staying, wanting his days wages and then to be off but Mother Maria fights him every step of the way until he decides to stay and finish the job.  By the films end both characters learn to let their pride rest and embrace the love of others.The script isn't very deep, just riding on the surface of subject but never breaking into the type of character study this could have proved itself to be.  It seems somewhat empty until the last few moments when some purpose is breathed into its lungs.  Poitier tries to deliver here, but you can tell that he is trying and that kills a lot of the experience.  The only performance I really found worthy of mention was that of Lilia Skala who played Mother Maria.  She really got into the heart of this woman and managed to make her seem real to me.`Lilies of the Field' is raved by many, considered a masterpiece and a landmark in film.  It is a landmark in that it provided us with the first African American Best Actor Oscar winner, a feat not to be repeated until 2001 when Denzel Washington won for his performance in `Training Day' (and since both Jamie Foxx and Forrest Whitaker have taken home top honors), but aside from that there is nothing impressive about this movie (and Poitier's win was very undeserved and thus very unimpressive).I know Oprah won't be happy with me for this, but it had to be said; sorry.",2,My lilies have been mowed over...,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,3040,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'review', 'much', 'did', 'Harry', 'Tonto', 'being', 'completely', 'honest', 'personally', 'feel', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'extremely', 'overrated', 'actor', 'find', 'rather', 'stiff', 'when', 'get', 'varying', 'displays', 'emotion', 'forced', 'opinion', 'know', 'minority', 'opinion', 'here', 'mine', 'stand', 'firmly', 'much', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'very', 'mannered', 'just', 'type', 'actor', 'who', 'things', 'book', 'rather', 'heart', 'difference', 'difference', 'least', 'Cage', 'delivered', 'two', 'very', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performances', 'Poitier', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'lucky.With', 'said', 'were', 'Poitier', 'Oscar', 'night', 'back', '1963', 'Oscars', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'held', '1964', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ashamed', 'look', 'out', 'audience', 'see', 'competitors', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'especially', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'know', 'robbed', 'Oscar', 'performance', ""n't"", 'even', 'same', 'league', 'theirs.The', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'choppy', 'much', 'undeserved', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination', 'managed', 'rack', 'up', 'decent', 'best', 'never', 'really', 'could', 'have.', 'Lilies', 'Field', 'story', 'Homer', 'Smith', 'traveling', 'handy-man', 'who', 'hustled', 'building', 'chapel', 'group', 'German', 'nuns', 'travels', 'nuns', 'are', 'lead', 'very', 'bossy', 'yet', 'very', 'genuine', 'Mother', 'Maria', 'survived', 'Nazis', 'retained', 'war', 'so-to-speak', 'interactions', 'others', 'may', 'seem', 'stern', 'unsociable', 'tinge', 'weakness', 'voice', 'fragility', 'Homer', 'apposed', 'staying', 'wanting', 'days', 'wages', 'then', 'be', 'off', 'Mother', 'Maria', 'fights', 'step', 'way', 'stay', 'finish', 'job', 'films', 'end', 'characters', 'learn', 'let', 'pride', 'rest', 'embrace', 'love', 'others.The', 'script', ""n't"", 'very', 'deep', 'just', 'riding', 'surface', 'subject', 'never', 'breaking', 'type', 'character', 'study', 'could', 'have', 'proved', 'be', 'somewhat', 'empty', 'last', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'purpose', 'breathed', 'lungs', 'Poitier', 'deliver', 'here', 'can', 'tell', 'trying', 'lot', 'experience', 'only', 'performance', 'really', 'found', 'worthy', 'mention', 'was', 'Lilia', 'Skala', 'who', 'played', 'Mother', 'Maria', 'really', 'got', 'heart', 'woman', 'managed', 'make', 'seem', 'real', 'me.', 'Lilies', 'Field', 'raved', 'many', 'considered', 'masterpiece', 'landmark', 'film', 'landmark', 'provided', 'first', 'African', 'American', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'feat', 'not', 'be', 'repeated', '2001', 'when', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'won', 'performance', 'Training', 'Day', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'have', 'taken', 'home', 'top', 'honors', 'aside', 'nothing', 'impressive', 'movie', 'Poitier', 'win', 'was', 'very', 'undeserved', 'thus', 'very', 'unimpressive', '.I', 'know', 'Oprah', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'had', 'be', 'said', 'sorry']",N/A

This one succeeds!I used to watch this when I was a child.  I saw it again over the weekend with my niece who is 13.  Every movie I dusted off to play she would revert back to her toddler days and start whining.  But I stuck to my guns and made her watch this.  Of course the whining was even louder when she saw it was in Black and White, but it didn't take long for her to be reeled in.  This movie is so endearing and it always amazes me how in ANY movie Sidney Poitier did in the early sixties he struck such a cord with the viewers to where you could not take your eyes off of him.  NO ONE could have made this role work other than him, even Gregory Peck who I adore.  Somehow it just wouldn't have been the same at all.With faith that could move a mountain the Reverend Mother thanks God for the man who will build a Chapel for her as Homer Smith or ""Omer Schmitt"" as she refers to him, stops there for water.  When he notices her giving Thanks, he is very quick to tell her he is ""just passing thru"" to which she replies ""Yah.... but you stopped.""  So begins the battle of faith and wills. She has no money in which to pay him; he works for hire so he can go further out west, yet thru her faith in God Homer will build her a ""SHAP-IL"".  Homer's charm and generosity both melts some of her icy exterior and makes her let go of her ferocious pride as head of household when he brings brightness to the sisters' barren existence yet he doesn't allow her to run him over.  (Not every time.)  Although he and the Reverend Mother are just like oil and water Homer finds that he cannot up and leave them.It's amazing how a story whose cinematography shows the starkness of the landscape with the nuns walking in the distance (just 5 little black dots against a panoramic landscape of blazing white) and gentle story line can make you feel serene and happy where you would not usually equate the desert to those feelings. It's such a beautiful flowing mix of emotions and visions that you can't help but feel heart broken when the reverend mother realizes at the end what is going on when the sisters are singing ""Amen."" You want everything to stay just as it is.

I saw it just recently for the first time in over 40 years and to my surprise it has lost none of its charm. It is just as light-hearted, humourous and relevant as I remembered it to be. Themes of racial harmony, brotherhood, community involvement and an honest day's work are still admirable values worth reminding us to practice.Sidney Poitier is the star here. And shine he does. His verbal sparring with Mother Maria (Lilia Skala) is brilliantly acted and memorable. He deservedly won an Oscar for his performance as the itinerant jack-of-all-trades Homer Smith. Lilia Skala's acting is stellar too as the strong-willed nun whose faith and perseverance convinces Homer Smith and others to build a chapel.The DVD itself is okay. Picture quality of this 1963 B&W; film is superb. Subtitles are in Spanish and French. The original trailer is a nice addition too.Overall, ""Lilies of the Field"" is a wonderful film for the entire family. It really doesn't matter what cultural or religious background you come from or what age group you fit in. My father was a German-American kid taught by Catholic nuns who had fled Nazi Germany, and I suppose there was a shared similarity with the East European nuns depicted in this film when he watched it.

Ice Cube? Mekhi Phifer?) As it is, the story gets to the point in short order, and gives a stronger lesson about teamwork, tolerance, and faith in its 94 minutes than most modern films do today (I'm sure there are cynics who'll read this and pigeonhole it in so-called 'political correctness' because it dares to mention positive race relations, but whether you agree or not, that is part of the world we live in). One could even argue that Poitier's relationship with Mother Superior Lilia Skala never really reaches a warm-and-fuzzy breakthrough, but I accept that compromise based on the fact that the characterizations are tight as a drum, and leave little room for a 180-degree change.

Fortunately, this film is not merely a time capsule curio but one whose message of universal kindness and understanding is timeless.  Why this film is not a heavy-handed message film is that director Ralph Nelson leavens the proceedings with light-hearted humor that would win over the most hard-hearted cynic.  The film is also blessed with a towering performance by Sidney Poitier as handyman Homer Smith.  Smith is a talented but directionless man who does not find his life calling until a group of Eastern bloc nuns entreat upon him to build them a chapel to serve a Mexican migrant congregation.  The impulse could have been for Poitier to play Homer as some kind of Superman but he manages to tap into the foibles and humor of the character.  Poitier won the Oscar for this role and in this case the Academy got it right.  I can't recall a film where he's been better.

It's remarkable how much better movies have become since then; it is equally remarkable how our moral universe has changed. What's amazing is that this film is not about race. Poitier is depicted as a man, just a regular Joe who happens to be black. This would be inconceivable in this so-called enlightened time. There is also no hint whatsoever of sex. The nuns may giggle when Poitier shimmies and shakes, but they sure aren't turned on. This too is inconceivable in this day and age. The film is thin. It has loads of potential, but little is made of one of the keys points, which is that Poitier plays a Southern Baptist, who has come to live at a Catholic mission. All sorts of conflicts have been left out; the opportunity for real conflict is glossed over in favor of the rather thin plotting, which emphasizes Poitier's unexplained drive to finish the chapel. Other than Poitier, none of the actors stands out. The nuns are underwritten, as is the priest, and Mexican barman.

His combination of charisma and realism in the role of Homer Smith absolutely grabs your attention and you can't help but watch him.Smith is an unemployed man, who is highly skilled with his hands and willing to take on odd jobs to make his way out of a small town in the Southwest.  By a strange twist of fate, he encounters an Eastern European nun, Mother Superior Maria (Lilia Skala), who has prayed to God that she be brought someone to build a chapel for the large immigrant population in her parish.  (They are holding worship services literally in the middle of the desert, with not church in sight.)  Every time Homer tries to leave, (seemingly) a higher power keeps bringing him back to Maria and the other sisters (who speak few words of English).Not only is this film a great examination of faith and the power of prayer, but it also is a great examination of racial and cultural relations in 1960s United States, through the eyes of immigrants and an outsider.

It' was great that he won Best Actor on this film playing Homer Smith, who is an out-of-work construction worker that helps a group of foreign (East European) Catholic nuns build their church and learn to speak English. Lilia Skala was great too. She earned her only Academy Award nomination (Supporting Actress) playing the head Mother Superior Maria. There are a lot of wonderful touching moments and funny interactions between these two main characters that will have you glued to the set.Sidney Poitier is masterful in this role and is greatly remembered for it. His subtle humor fills the plot, even becoming hilarious at times. In one scene Homer is teaching the German nuns English, and he cannot help himself from modeling for them some Southern black dialect: Instead of ""I stand up,"" he grins as the sisters follow his ""Ah stands up, y'all""! Homer is so likable because he is good-natured, but Poitier lends texture to his character mainly through his interaction with his foil, the Mother Superior who will not thank him for all of his labors. Watch for strong musical scenes from Poitier as well, in which he intermingles his own religious background with the nun's East Germany Catholicism.Lilia Skala is appropriately stern and commanding as Mother Maria. We know the sisters have come a long way, even over the Berlin Wall, to get to this inherited property in the American desert. The broken English spoken by her and her charges serves to endear the nuns to us. They are all humble but fiercely devoted people. As Juan, Stanley Adams does nice work. Although his accent and diction smack of falseness - this man seems to want to revert to a Bronx twang - Adams musters a rascally nonchalance that bonds him with Homer. Juan also functions as a template for the modern age: Catholic-born, this agnostic now serves meals in his restaurant while the traveling priest says mass for the people who have come from far and wide.Dan Frazer does well as Father Murphy, the priest whose prayers for a massive cathedral were answered with a trailer with bald tires. And director Ralph Nelson ( who made many films beside this one, notably ""Requiem for a Heavyweight,"" ""Father Goose"" and ""Charly) acquits himself well as Mr. Ashton, the slightly racist builder who employs Homer and who is the victim of Mother Maria's constant pleas for donations.

I think people really need to take this movie for what it is, rather than what it could (or should) be.This was Poiter's breakout role. He had appeared in smaller roles leading up to this, and he was a very likable personality. I truly believe he won the Academy Award for Best Actor because people really responded to this newly arrived negro actor; whose character, personality and creativity were a refreshing break from the status quo.Also, the movie was made on a shoestring budget of just $240,000, which was a lot of money almost 50 years ago, but was still small potatoes compared to the average film. It had an ""indie"" feel to it, was a simple movie about faith, (which really appealed to people back then and now.)It was the dark horse nomination, because of its stature, subject matter, and main characters, but it was so warmly received at the time, it really overcame a lot of established attitudes. It was the kind of movie people really loved to love.Poiter plays something of a ""magic negro"" in this picture. You'll have to read up on that term, but it basically a black man who is completely non-threatening to whites, is always altruistic and trustable, and basically sacrifices himself for the good of the cause. There are a long list of movies with this character, and they are not bad movies at all. I appeals strongly to the white psyche, and makes black people more accessible. Poiter delivers this like a charm, and it won him the award.The movie itself was nominated for Best Picture, which is amazing when you consider the budget and production values. Like I said, its a movie people love to love. Its simple, engaging, tremendously charming, and appeals to all people on many levels. Its the kind of movie that is universally appealing.I think I watched it on TV when I was about 5 or 6, and I remember crying at the end. I found it very touching and cathartic when Homer signs his name at the top of the chapel. And of course, the uplifting and iconic ""Amen"" song, which transcends the movie itself and creates a persona of its own, (like the whistling tune from Bridge Over the River Kwai.) You can't help hum and sing along, as it stays with you for days; reminding you of the touching themes of the movie.Probably the strongest element of the movie, and often overlooked, is the very thematic and well-arranged musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, (same composer of the Waltons and dozens of other theme songs.) He was a master of this genre, and this was one of this best. The score was well applied, and helped the movie achieve its emotional goals.Its one of those ""special movies"" that achieves an emotional space few movies attain. Its what most people get involved with motion pictures for. It totally stands on its own, and has a very sincere honesty and homeyness that is totally endearing and acceptable. Like a good friend.Lilies of the Field still makes me cry.

It stars Sidney Poitier in an Academy-winning role as a young man named Homer Smith who lives in his car and befriends a group of German immigrant nuns on the way.

When it becomes clear to him, they are penniless and have as much power of paying him as sending him to the moon he disappears, leaving the chapel half finished. However, he returns in a week to honor his word and do all he agreed to do out of the goodness of his heart.Sidney Poitier pulls off Homer's strengths and weaknesses well and brings a considerable amount of warmth and charm to the role. Lilia Skala also gives a great performance as the Mother Abbess and her interviews with Poitier are among the film's finest moments.James Poe's screenplay does an excellent job exploring the motivations of the characters in a short and snappy but sufficient manner.

Poitier won the Oscar, and most deserved (some may take issue that Albert Finney's Tom Jones should've). One thing that some people miss is the fact that the nuns had been through hell, and so has the Black man. Once they connect, and understand each others' hell (or redemption), life goes on and goodness happens.  I take exception with previous reviewers who said the townsfolk were inadequate; Stanley Adams has always been a reliable actor (Summer & Smoke). The new respect for independent film makes me think that this is a better film than we realize. The best thing of all is that any actor, of any color, could play this role.

Does this black and white, 1960's film stand up in these contemporary times?  Not only does it stand up, it stands up with a pride and dignity that puts most of today's lame Hollywood efforts to shame!This is a simple story, but it is proof that a simple story, illuminating simple human truths, if told well, can go on to live powerfully in one's memory.  A wandering man inadvertendly stumbles onto a convent of nuns who believe that he has been &quot;sent&quot; to build their long awaited church.  His better sense tells him to move on.  His heart tricks him into staying. A crazy idea gradually transforms into a collective project, and the embodiment of a dream fulfilled.  I also like that Poitier's character is so well defined and developed that the fact that he is black and the nuns are white does not factor one bit into the telling of the story.  Interestingly, Poitier points out in his memoir that the production of this film oddly anticipated the story it told. The director was given a paltry sum to make the movie, since producers were convinced it would not be successful. Rather than conclude that the budget was too tight, the director carried on, asking the cast and crew to make extraordinary sacrifices, including unpaid rehearsal (in violation of actors' union rules).  But such was the faith of those committed to bringing &quot;Lillies of the Field&quot; to screen.  Such was the faith portrayed in the film.  So, in effect, a wondrous film that simply HAD to find its way to realization.

Thus it is a pleasant surprise for me to be charmed by a film which, quite simply, is about faith. Not faith in the traditional evangelical sense, which is perhaps why it appeals to me; it's about faith in other people, in honesty and commitment, and...sappy as it sounds...in doing good.One key reason why I enjoyed &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot; is because my favorite films are character-centred dramas (especially black and white ones!). This is just one in a list of such films released under MGM's &quot;Vintage Classics&quot; DVD label, joining the ranks of such greats as &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; and &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;. They are simple, well-scripted and directed films that, when all is said and done, sink or swim on the quality of one thing: an actor's performance, in this case the legendary Sidney Poitier. He carries the character of Homer Smith with expert precision, neither making him overly-compassionate or overly-selfish (a lesser actor might have gone one of these two directions), and very much deserving of the Academy Award he won. He is of course joined by several quality supporting actors, most notably Lilia Skala as the cantankerous Mother Maria and Stanley Adams in a rare dramatic role as the gas station owner, Juan.Ultimately, the story is a little on the thin side - it is _very_ simplistic, even more so than most movies of its kind - and some characters, especially the other nuns, do little more than nod and smile, but the natural warmth and humor of the film carry it the full 95-minute length and leave the viewer feeling satisfied.

He is not only smart and talented but also embodies a sense of decency no matter what character he's playing.  In this, he is like few other actors.  (Gregory Peck and, to a lesser degree, Robert  Redford come to mind.)  He has enormous charisma even in some of his later, less satisfying movies.  It is not an accident, corny as it may sound, that I was inspired as a boy to even consider teaching by his turn in ""To Sir, with Love""; I've long since moved on from any such idealistic notions, but Poitier made teaching an even nobler calling than it is.  I was surprised that I'd not seen ""Lilies of the Field"" until recently, both because it is one of my mother's favorite movies and because it got him a well-deserved Academy Award. (I'm also surprised that it was directed by Ralph Nelson, whose eclectic body of works includes the uber-violent ""Soldier Blue"" a few years later.) The story is sweet and grounded in reality. A handyman drifter encounters a group of destitute, mostly German nuns who through a combination of beguilement and determination get him to build them a chapel. For most of the film, Poitier's Homer Smith butts heads with Mother Maria Mathe (Lilia Skala), whom at one point he compares to Hitler. She is tough-as-nails, and in one particularly charming scene, out Bibles the Baptist Smith in a contest of using scripture to find a way to not have to pay him.  Smith, or Schmidt, as the nuns call him, ultimately and not surprisingly comes around to their way of thinking. Based on a novel by William Edmund Barrett, ""Lilies of the Field"" is sentimental without being treacly, succeeding more because it is honest than because of anything manipulative. It doesn't ram religion down anyone's throat, and yet makes believing in something more meaningful than petty self interest as natural an expression of human experience as eating and breathing.  Even Jerry Goldsmith's modest score, including the hymn ""Amen,"" never overshadows the sincerity of the emotions. The movie may seem quaint in this age of mega churches and assembly-line tithing and salvation, but, its dramatic qualities notwithstanding, ""Lilies of the Field"" says more about the spirit of what it preaches than a thousand fire and brimstone types resorting to telling rather than showing, or, perhaps, pontificating rather than living.",5,Excellent!,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,2373,"['Sidney', 'Poiter', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'not', 'only', 'smart', 'talented', 'also', 'sense', 'decency', 'matter', 'what', 'playing', 'few', 'other', 'actors', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'come', 'mind', 'enormous', 'charisma', 'even', 'later', 'less', 'satisfying', 'movies', 'not', 'accident', 'corny', 'may', 'sound', 'was', 'inspired', 'boy', 'even', 'consider', 'teaching', 'turn', 'Sir', 'Love', ""'ve"", 'long', 'moved', 'such', 'idealistic', 'notions', 'Poitier', 'made', 'teaching', 'even', 'nobler', 'calling', 'was', 'surprised', ""'d"", 'not', 'seen', 'Lilies', 'Field', 'recently', 'one', 'mother', 'favorite', 'movies', 'got', 'well-deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', ""'m"", 'also', 'surprised', 'was', 'directed', 'Ralph', 'Nelson', 'eclectic', 'body', 'works', 'uber-violent', 'Soldier', 'Blue', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'story', 'sweet', 'grounded', 'reality', 'handyman', 'drifter', 'group', 'destitute', 'mostly', 'German', 'nuns', 'who', 'combination', 'beguilement', 'determination', 'get', 'build', 'chapel', 'most', 'film', 'Poitier', 'Homer', 'Smith', 'butts', 'heads', 'Mother', 'Maria', 'Mathe', 'Lilia', 'Skala', 'whom', 'one', 'point', 'Hitler', 'tough-as-nails', 'one', 'particularly', 'charming', 'scene', 'Bibles', 'Baptist', 'Smith', 'contest', 'using', 'scripture', 'find', 'way', 'not', 'have', 'pay', 'Smith', 'Schmidt', 'nuns', 'call', 'ultimately', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'way', 'thinking', 'Based', 'novel', 'William', 'Edmund', 'Barrett', 'Lilies', 'Field', 'sentimental', 'being', 'treacly', 'succeeding', 'more', 'honest', 'anything', 'manipulative', ""n't"", 'ram', 'religion', 'down', 'anyone', 'throat', 'yet', 'believing', 'something', 'more', 'meaningful', 'petty', 'self', 'interest', 'natural', 'expression', 'human', 'experience', 'eating', 'breathing', 'Even', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'modest', 'score', 'including', 'hymn', 'Amen', 'never', 'sincerity', 'emotions', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'quaint', 'age', 'mega', 'churches', 'assembly-line', 'tithing', 'salvation', 'dramatic', 'qualities', 'notwithstanding', 'Lilies', 'Field', 'more', 'spirit', 'what', 'thousand', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'types', 'resorting', 'telling', 'rather', 'showing', 'perhaps', 'pontificating', 'rather', 'living']",N/A
