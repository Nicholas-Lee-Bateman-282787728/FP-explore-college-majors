830194,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0002CHI7Y,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 1]","Krzystof Kieslowski directed one of the more interesting self-reflexive films in 1979, when he filmed Camera Buff (Amator- literally Amateur), his second feature film, which runs an hour and fifty-two minutes. It is the one which made him a known commodity in the filmic world. While not a great film, it is a bit more successful a film than other fare from that era, such as his own Blind Chance, from 1981, and this film was a co-winner of the Grand Prize at the 1979 Moscow Film Festival, although that dubious festival's selections have long been known to be laughably bad, at their worst. As with many films made in countries with repressive countries, Camera Buff can get a bit didactic at times, but when it's not preaching it's a pretty good look at the art of filmmaking and the responsibility of an artist to himself and his art.The tale is not a particularly fresh one, as it follows the life of a none too bright factory worker named Filip Mosz (Jerzy Stuhr, who later appears in White), a typically mousey Polish man who loves to drink, who is contented with his life as a husband and father of a newborn baby girl Irenka. However, when he decides to buy an 8 mm Russian camera, that costs two months of his salary, to record his daughter's childhood, his life quickly unravels. His wife Irka (Malgorzata Zabkowska) does not support his hobby, and selfishly wishes him ill. Eventually, she will leave him and take their child, even as she is pregnant with a second child. Hers is a character that is typical of the non-artistic mindset, as are the managers at the local factory he works for, as a nationwide buyer, who decide to underwrite his `hobby' so he can film company propaganda about their Twenty-Fifth Anniversary. That and his subsequent films are rather dull treatises on banal aspects of life in a state run system, but somehow they get nominated for film awards at a local festival the company submits them to. In truth, they are particularly unartful films, which only highlights the absurdity of their political potential in a system where total faith is required.Kieslowski has a good deal of fun with both the pomposity of such film festival sponsors, mere apparatchiks who clearly have no idea of what real art is, as well as poking fun at the bad artist types themselves, represented by a fiery character called The Lunatic, who hisses and rages at all such films. Filip's film wins third prize at the festival; really second prize, since all of the films are judged not good enough for a first prize. This is manifest to the viewer, but even the declarer of such dour judgments is shown satirically as a boob, and orates far too pompously about art. Of course, Filip's films attract the interest of a woman named Anna Wlodarczyk (Ewa Pokas), who is a national film board honcho who has slept her way to the top and soon becomes Filip's lover, as well as real-life Polish filmmaker Krzystof Zanussi, who gets Filip's films on local Polish television news, after meeting and arguing of film aesthetics with him in Lodz. Especially successful is a film Filip does on the life of a dwarf at the company. That this man is contented with his dull and deprived life says much of the dehumanizing conditions of Communism, but it also exposes Filip to the increasing censorship of the director of his company. The premise of this trope is that the camera can never be neutral, and all art is political. Of course, this is a fallacy, but one employed as the engine that sets this film in motion, despite its logical weakness and triteness....Camera Buff is a film that gives hints at the greatness Kieslowski had within, but it was still a few years away, and, even though it's a better film than Blind Chance, it's one that is probably best viewed after the later masterpieces, for then even its failures can have some resonances as trial runs for things other films would succeed far better at. Would that more people learned so well from their youthful endeavors.",3,Good film,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,3989,"['Krzystof', 'Kieslowski', 'directed', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'self-reflexive', 'films', '1979', 'when', 'filmed', 'Camera', 'Buff', 'Amator-', 'literally', 'Amateur', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'hour', 'fifty-two', 'minutes', 'one', 'made', 'known', 'commodity', 'filmic', 'world', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'successful', 'film', 'other', 'fare', 'era', 'such', 'own', 'Blind', 'Chance', '1981', 'film', 'was', 'co-winner', 'Grand', 'Prize', '1979', 'Moscow', 'Film', 'Festival', 'dubious', 'festival', 'selections', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'known', 'be', 'laughably', 'bad', 'worst', 'many', 'films', 'made', 'countries', 'repressive', 'countries', 'Camera', 'Buff', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'didactic', 'times', 'when', 'not', 'preaching', 'pretty', 'good', 'look', 'art', 'filmmaking', 'responsibility', 'artist', 'art.The', 'tale', 'not', 'particularly', 'fresh', 'one', 'life', 'none', 'too', 'bright', 'factory', 'worker', 'named', 'Filip', 'Mosz', 'Jerzy', 'Stuhr', 'who', 'later', 'White', 'typically', 'mousey', 'Polish', 'man', 'who', 'drink', 'who', 'contented', 'life', 'husband', 'father', 'newborn', 'baby', 'girl', 'Irenka', 'However', 'when', 'buy', '8', 'mm', 'Russian', 'camera', 'two', 'months', 'salary', 'record', 'daughter', 'childhood', 'life', 'quickly', 'unravels', 'wife', 'Irka', 'Malgorzata', 'Zabkowska', 'not', 'support', 'hobby', 'selfishly', 'wishes', 'ill', 'Eventually', 'will', 'leave', 'take', 'child', 'even', 'pregnant', 'second', 'child', 'Hers', 'character', 'typical', 'non-artistic', 'mindset', 'are', 'managers', 'local', 'factory', 'nationwide', 'buyer', 'who', 'decide', 'underwrite', 'hobby', 'can', 'film', 'company', 'propaganda', 'Twenty-Fifth', 'Anniversary', 'subsequent', 'films', 'are', 'rather', 'dull', 'treatises', 'banal', 'aspects', 'life', 'state', 'run', 'system', 'somehow', 'get', 'nominated', 'film', 'awards', 'local', 'festival', 'company', 'truth', 'are', 'particularly', 'unartful', 'films', 'only', 'absurdity', 'political', 'potential', 'system', 'where', 'total', 'faith', 'required.Kieslowski', 'good', 'deal', 'fun', 'pomposity', 'such', 'film', 'festival', 'sponsors', 'mere', 'apparatchiks', 'who', 'clearly', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'real', 'art', 'as', 'well', 'poking', 'fun', 'bad', 'artist', 'types', 'represented', 'fiery', 'character', 'called', 'Lunatic', 'who', 'rages', 'such', 'films', 'Filip', 'film', 'third', 'prize', 'festival', 'really', 'second', 'prize', 'films', 'are', 'judged', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'first', 'prize', 'manifest', 'viewer', 'even', 'declarer', 'such', 'dour', 'judgments', 'shown', 'satirically', 'boob', 'far', 'too', 'pompously', 'art', 'course', 'Filip', 'films', 'attract', 'interest', 'woman', 'named', 'Anna', 'Wlodarczyk', 'Ewa', 'Pokas', 'who', 'national', 'film', 'board', 'honcho', 'who', 'slept', 'way', 'top', 'soon', 'Filip', 'lover', 'as', 'well', 'real-life', 'Polish', 'filmmaker', 'Krzystof', 'Zanussi', 'who', 'Filip', 'films', 'local', 'Polish', 'television', 'news', 'meeting', 'arguing', 'film', 'aesthetics', 'Lodz', 'Especially', 'successful', 'film', 'Filip', 'life', 'dwarf', 'company', 'man', 'contented', 'dull', 'deprived', 'life', 'much', 'dehumanizing', 'conditions', 'Communism', 'also', 'Filip', 'increasing', 'censorship', 'director', 'company', 'premise', 'trope', 'camera', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'neutral', 'art', 'political', 'course', 'fallacy', 'one', 'employed', 'engine', 'film', 'motion', 'logical', 'weakness', 'triteness', '.Camera', 'Buff', 'film', 'hints', 'greatness', 'Kieslowski', 'had', 'was', 'still', 'few', 'years', 'away', 'even', 'better', 'film', 'Blind', 'Chance', 'one', 'probably', 'best', 'viewed', 'later', 'masterpieces', 'then', 'even', 'failures', 'can', 'have', 'resonances', 'trial', 'runs', 'things', 'other', 'films', 'would', 'succeed', 'far', 'better', 'Would', 'more', 'people', 'learned', 'so', 'well', 'youthful', 'endeavors']",N/A
830195,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B0002CHI7Y,Doug Anderson,"[0, 0]","This is a film that at first appears to be about a very ordinary man who almost by accident becomes a filmmaker. But by the end of this film (and especially with that last shot) we realize that what we have been watching is a very personal record of Kieslowski's own artistic and moral development (the latter being an unintended affect of the former).Initially, Filip Mosz buys a movie camera in order to record his newborn daughter, but once he begins filming the world around him, filmmaking (and the artistic aspirations that come with it) becomes an almost instant addiction that does not bring him closer to his family and simple happiness but takes him further and further away from it. His wife, Irka, rightfully perceives that this new instrument has transformed her husband into a different kind of man, one who is no longer content with his family and his place in the world. This can be read as a criticism of communist society (where aspirations are not encouraged) but nothing in this film is clear-cut and the dissolution of the marriage can also be read as a criticism of human ambition (and the way aspirations lead to discontent). This aspect of the film is thus not Cold War Poland-specific (a criticism directed at some of Kieslowski's earlier work), but resonates like the best and most universal short stories by Maupaussant or Chekov.In addition to this examination of the way the movie camera changes Filip at home we get an examination of how the movie camera changes him at work (and ultimately how it changes the way he engages with and perceives the social world around him). Once the administrators at his factory realize he owns a movie camera, they hire him to make films that celebrate factory life and the joys of communal working and living, and, at first, he is all too happy to oblige. But the administrators who commission his films are not always happy with what Filip shows and they insist that he censor anything that represents the factory or communism or humanity in a negative or compromising light. This desire to show the world as it is makes Filip a promising young filmmaker in the eyes of the film intelligentsia (who see his work at festivals) and this ongoing pressure to show the world as the communist administrators would like it to be simply makes him even more aware of and more critical of the disconnect between reality and ideology. And this conflict leads to surprising and unsuspected realizations about artistic idenitity, ownership and intentionality.Because it is populated by mostly small-town types with minimal education and experience of the world, the film seems deceptively simple, but it is really a very complex and extended meditation on very complex issues like the nature of happiness, the productive and destructive nature of artistic development and aspiration, and the gradual evolution of a political (and moral) conscience in a world where motivations are not always clear and where actions often have intended as well as unintended effects.The most controversial aspect of the film is Kieslowski's portrayal of the local administrators/government officials who commission Filip to make films. Most Polish filmmakers in the Cold War era represent communist party administrators and officials as oppressors who act in the interest of the party not in the interest of the people, but in Amator (Camera Buff) Kieslowski offers a much more sympathetic portrait of those administrators and officials and censors (and this is something he will also do in some of his later work). In fact, he shows one communist functionary to be quite caring and more invested in the improvement of the community than in party ideology. This is especially brave when one considers how easily Kieslowski could have been viewed as a communist apologist. But when one views the film and how observant Filip (and by extension Kieslowski) is, one can see that he is not a man who views the world through an ideological lens but one who simply views and records what he actually sees with his own eyes. It is clear in Amator (more than in any film I have ever seen) that (in Kieslowski's view) the filmmaker's first allegiance is to his own powers of observation and to the recording of those first-hand observations for all to see. And it is also clear in this film (more than in any other film that I have seen) that documentary filmmakers cannot control how their observations will be perceived or used by others and what affects their images will have on the lives of those they show. This is most clearly shown when Filip makes a film about a dwarf (intended to expose the hardships of the factory worker and his lack of social mobility) that leads to the dwarf being fired (since the film made it seem as though the factory was exploiting this worker instead of offering him security). As Filip becomes aware of the unintended effects of his work, he begins to question whether he should continue to be a filmmaker at all. No other filmmaker explores moral dilemmas as starkly and convincingly as Kieslowski.But perhaps the greatest scene in the film is the one where, very near the end, the filmmaker Filip turns the camera slowly around so that instead of facing outward it faces inward, and instead of being used as a tool with which to investigate the outer world, it becomes a tool with which to investigate the inner world. When we look at the films that came before Amator (many of which were documentaries featuring non-actors) and the ones that came after (all fictional films starring professional actors/actresses and all ruminations on individual subjectivites and moral choices), it is clear that this film is the essentail turning point in Kieslowski's life.*In addition to Camera Buff this DVD includes multiple interviews and the wonderful 14 min short Talking Heads, a very simple film that asks approx 80 people (ranging in age from 1-100) three simple questions:a)Who are you?b)When were you born?c)What is important for you?The result is one of the most simple and insightful and moving documentaries (Kieslowski's last) I have ever seen.",5,And I rarely give a film 5 stars,1366156800,"04 17,

When his wife announces she is leaving, the camera buff only can frame her departing figure with his fingers. Action!

The color images (full frame, enhanced) and sound are adequate. Subtitles are clear. This is one of four recent additions to Kino's Kieslowski collection -- along with ""No End,"" ""The Scar"" and ""Blind Chance"" -- all of which show that the Polish master's writing and directing skills arrived almost fully formed when he turned to feature films.

Wajda has dazzled the world with his brutal film The man of marble"" in 1976. The airs of the imminent turmoil resound and get close.  The initial seeds sown by Andrezj Wajda (Ashes and diamonds) began to show its fruits, Zanussi and Kieslowski were deeply convinced filmmakers respect a change had to come in this always troubled and valorous country.In this devastating political satire from Poland, Jerzy Stuhr plays Filip, an insignificant and shy factory worker who, after the birth of his first child, buys an 8mm movie camera to record his daughter's first few years on film. But it happens that before long, Filip is happily obsessed with his new hobby, and he graduates from simply capturing his daughter's activities to photographing practically the quotidian reality around him. Soon, his movie mania attracts the attentions of his boss, who gives him a new task: making films that will give outsiders a clearer picture of how things work at their factory. However, Filip's ceaseless photography begins to drive his wife (Malgorzata Zabkowska) crazy who really feels herself ignored due this new techno-intruder;  she threatens to leave him, while his boss is not at all happy with Filip's films. Despite they're quite good, earning television broadcast time and winning awards, their messages don't conform with his party's political and economic agenda, and Filip is warned to soften the tone of his work or he'll lose his job.So, in this state of things you would agree with this famous statement ""You can't  always get what you want"", on one hand his wife doesn't internalise the prize of the success and the enormous possibilities before her and a future that may be enhanced; a bureaucrat boss who only thinks according the laws of an oppressive system where to watch over the appearances is much more important than to dare the real state of things . Eventually Filip will the best he can inviting to Zanussi one of the most daredevil filmmakers in that obscure decade of the seventies to express himself respect the creative freedom.It's useless to say the movie goes far beyond, showing the horrid and petrifying existence regarded as a normal way of life.

The story is about a young man (as played by Jerzy Stuhr) who is happy.  He has a loving wife, a newborn baby, and a nice home.  He gets an 8 mm video camera to record his daughter growing up, but it turns into a hobby with a life of its own.  As he grows more successful in his endeavors, his wife becomes jealous.  Although the story is straightforward, it is one that really draws you in and gets interesting right away.As we watch the story of a man making stories with films, we can almost see that it is like playing god, but not one that is all-powerful.  Ironically, all too often in life just as everything is going well in one area, something else falls apart.  I think part of the appeal of the film has to due with the fact that we can relate with at least some of the messages.  It doesn't portray life in some glamorized way, and I think the viewers can appreciate that.""Amator"" has that Kieslowski feeling to it and is a great film.  I found the story to be unpredictable enough to keep me guessing, so it was thoroughly entertaining with its great acting and storyline.
