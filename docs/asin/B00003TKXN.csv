546714,A1A9AO87H4OSDX,B00003TKXN,"Ian S. Horst ""IS Horst""","[7, 8]","Hunky Polish actor Daniel Obrychski plays our hero Andrzej Kmicic in this saga of love, war, and treachery in 17th-century Poland. Kmicic falls in love with the lovely Olenka only to have a pre-Ikea Swedish invasion complicate matters for him. Kmicic unwisely chooses to ally himself with the dastardly Hetman Radziwill who promptly hands over the country to the Swedish King and his evil hordes of musketeers after the Hetman promises to keep Olenka safe. (Pay attention to the hats: it's the only way to keep track of the good guys and the bad guys in this complicated epic. The Swedes wear big floppy wide brimmed ones, the Poles demure feathered pillboxes or furry turbans). Accused of treachery by the loyal Poles, Kmicic is abandoned by his pals including Colonel Wolodyjowski (of the eponymous earlier-filmed sequal), who start a rebellion. Escaping death numerous times, Kmicic steals away (leaving Olenka in the hands of the dastardly fop Prince Boguslav Radziwill), changes his name, and saves the Monastery of Czestochowa with its Black Madonna from the giant Swedish siege gun. He then saves the good Polish king Jan Kazimir from the Swedes, convincing his old pals of his true loyalty to Poland. Defeating the armies of the Swedish King, Prince Boguslav, and English mercenaries in a massively staged battle (with the aid of the exotic Tatars of Aga Khan), Kmicic is near mortally wounded and sent home to die. Meanwhile Olenka has escaped from Boguslav's lair and, after Kmicic's umpteenth miraculous recovery, forgives Kmicic for his sins and  it's happy ever after for Poland and  its romantic heroes.Anyway it's all grandly filmed to epic proportions with amazing costumes and battle scenes. The production values of this film are much higher than Hoffman's predecessor Pan Wolodyjowski, and the complicated story seems a little more rounded out. The filmmakers seem to have decided Daniel Obrychski needed a LOT of eye makeup to help him look tragic and soulful, but heck, it's art. It is of course a caricature in its comic-book patriotism, but a rewarding and entertaining one at that. The VHS print is adequate, though the subtitles are badly timed and sometimes atrociously spelled and occasionally completely indicipherable.I saw this film for the first time in Poland in 1976 and it holds up well. Interesting little known history and cinematic spectacle.",4,The Swedes Were Not Always All IKEA and ABBA,989193600,"05 7, 2001",2001,2379,"['Hunky', 'Polish', 'actor', 'Daniel', 'Obrychski', 'hero', 'Andrzej', 'Kmicic', 'saga', 'love', 'war', 'treachery', '17th-century', 'Poland', 'Kmicic', 'love', 'lovely', 'Olenka', 'only', 'have', 'pre-Ikea', 'Swedish', 'invasion', 'complicate', 'matters', 'Kmicic', 'unwisely', 'ally', 'dastardly', 'Hetman', 'Radziwill', 'who', 'promptly', 'country', 'Swedish', 'King', 'evil', 'hordes', 'musketeers', 'Hetman', 'keep', 'Olenka', 'safe', 'Pay', 'attention', 'hats', 'only', 'way', 'keep', 'track', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'complicated', 'epic', 'Swedes', 'wear', 'big', 'floppy', 'wide', 'brimmed', 'ones', 'Poles', 'demure', 'feathered', 'pillboxes', 'furry', 'turbans', 'Accused', 'treachery', 'loyal', 'Poles', 'Kmicic', 'abandoned', 'pals', 'including', 'Colonel', 'Wolodyjowski', 'eponymous', 'earlier-filmed', 'sequal', 'who', 'start', 'rebellion', 'Escaping', 'death', 'numerous', 'times', 'Kmicic', 'away', 'leaving', 'Olenka', 'hands', 'dastardly', 'fop', 'Prince', 'Boguslav', 'Radziwill', 'name', 'Monastery', 'Czestochowa', 'Black', 'Madonna', 'giant', 'Swedish', 'siege', 'gun', 'then', 'good', 'Polish', 'king', 'Jan', 'Kazimir', 'Swedes', 'convincing', 'old', 'pals', 'true', 'loyalty', 'Poland', 'Defeating', 'armies', 'Swedish', 'King', 'Prince', 'Boguslav', 'English', 'mercenaries', 'massively', 'staged', 'battle', 'aid', 'exotic', 'Tatars', 'Aga', 'Khan', 'Kmicic', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'sent', 'home', 'die', 'Meanwhile', 'Olenka', 'escaped', 'Boguslav', 'lair', 'Kmicic', 'umpteenth', 'miraculous', 'recovery', 'Kmicic', 'sins', 'happy', 'ever', 'Poland', 'romantic', 'heroes.Anyway', 'grandly', 'filmed', 'epic', 'proportions', 'amazing', 'costumes', 'battle', 'scenes', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'are', 'much', 'higher', 'Hoffman', 'predecessor', 'Pan', 'Wolodyjowski', 'complicated', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'rounded', 'out', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'have', 'decided', 'Daniel', 'Obrychski', 'needed', 'LOT', 'eye', 'makeup', 'help', 'look', 'tragic', 'soulful', 'heck', 'art', 'course', 'caricature', 'comic-book', 'patriotism', 'rewarding', 'entertaining', 'one', 'VHS', 'print', 'adequate', 'subtitles', 'are', 'badly', 'timed', 'sometimes', 'atrociously', 'spelled', 'occasionally', 'completely', 'indicipherable.I', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'Poland', '1976', 'up', 'well', 'Interesting', 'little', 'known', 'history', 'cinematic', 'spectacle']",N/A

C Clark ""eanna""","[2, 2]","Since others have summarized the strengths (amazing battle scenes, no cgi, eminently believable hand to hand combat, delicious dueling) and its troubles, (the makeup, the soulful Olenka soulfully staring, and the difficulty in keeping straight who's who for a non-Pole) let me just offer one tiny addition.Prince Boguslaw Radziwill is one of the most amazing characters I have ever seen in film. I've not read the novel, though I bet they were being faithful, but the arrogance, self-centered conceit, and yet ferocious skill and bravery were wonderfully portrayed. So often when seeing costume dramas, the nobles seem too much like us, just with nicer clothes and houses. Boguslaw makes it clear in every slight action and tiny gesture that he has nothing in common with his inferiors. A larger than life villain, he is clearly who he is, for better or worse. The film improved hugely when he arrived.The colors are a bit washed out, and the sound feels as if it were added later...very odd. I bet seeing this when new, with a vibrant print and roaring sound on a vast screen would have been an amazing experience. Watching it on my not-so-big screen was still a treat.And you will see the finest collection of facial hair ever gathered on screen.

546717,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,B00003TKXN,Richard J. Brzostek,"[14, 14]","Potop (The Deluge) is the second film directed Jerzy Hoffman depicting the 17th century adventures of Henryk Sienkiewicz's trilogy of novels.  This epic history captures the spirit of Polish patriotism at the time when the Swedes scourged the Polish countryside in the 1650s.  The story is not entirely straightforward, but has some twists and intrigues.Daniel Olbrychski plays Kmicic in this film, who gets himself into several touchy situations where doing what seemed right at the time created problems for himself and his reputation.  He faces several ethical dilemmas as his actions led to him killing his fellows and his country.  As much as he tries to make a good choice, he comes up short.  He puts himself in the ""line of fire"" several times trying to make up for his misdeeds.  To me, this was an amazing part of the film as we all try to do well, but do not always make the wisest of decisions.  As this theme was repeated several times, it made an impression on me that the film is not just a war story, but has meaningful messages as well, such as our attempt to make the right choices in life.Kmicic at first seems annoying and even boorish, but as we get to know him, he becomes a very likeable and charming character.  The fact that Olbrychski convincingly makes us dislike this character then love him is a reflection of his strong acting skill.  Olbrychski plays a different role in all three of Hoffman's movies of the Sienkiewicz trilogy, but this one is the largest, being the lead character.Potop brings us close and personal into 17th century warfare.  Although the battles are gruesome, I have to say the effects and costumes are remarkably well done for this 1974 film.  We get to see duels on foot and horseback, the siege of Czestochowa in which the Swedes and the Poles both use cannons to bombard each other, and a large-scale battle in which Tartars then winged-hussars attack a Swedish formation.  My favorite has to be all the cannons, so much so that it makes me want to get one.  I highly recommend Potop for those that enjoy historic epics.  The movie has it all: war, love, and even deeper meanings if we look for them.",5,An epic history that captures the spirit of Polish patriotism at the time when the Swedes scourged the Polish countryside,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,2156,"['Potop', 'Deluge', 'second', 'film', 'directed', 'Jerzy', 'Hoffman', 'depicting', '17th', 'century', 'adventures', 'Henryk', 'Sienkiewicz', 'trilogy', 'novels', 'epic', 'history', 'spirit', 'Polish', 'patriotism', 'time', 'when', 'Swedes', 'scourged', 'Polish', 'countryside', '1650s', 'story', 'not', 'entirely', 'straightforward', 'twists', 'intrigues.Daniel', 'Olbrychski', 'Kmicic', 'film', 'who', 'several', 'touchy', 'situations', 'where', 'doing', 'what', 'seemed', 'right', 'time', 'created', 'problems', 'reputation', 'several', 'ethical', 'dilemmas', 'actions', 'led', 'killing', 'fellows', 'country', 'As', 'much', 'make', 'good', 'choice', 'up', 'short', 'line', 'fire', 'several', 'times', 'trying', 'make', 'up', 'misdeeds', 'was', 'amazing', 'part', 'film', 'try', 'do', 'well', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'make', 'wisest', 'decisions', 'theme', 'was', 'repeated', 'several', 'times', 'made', 'impression', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'war', 'story', 'meaningful', 'messages', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'attempt', 'make', 'right', 'choices', 'life.Kmicic', 'first', 'annoying', 'even', 'boorish', 'get', 'know', 'very', 'likeable', 'charming', 'character', 'fact', 'Olbrychski', 'convincingly', 'dislike', 'character', 'then', 'love', 'reflection', 'strong', 'acting', 'skill', 'Olbrychski', 'different', 'role', 'three', 'Hoffman', 'movies', 'Sienkiewicz', 'trilogy', 'one', 'largest', 'being', 'lead', 'character.Potop', 'close', 'personal', '17th', 'century', 'warfare', 'battles', 'are', 'gruesome', 'have', 'say', 'effects', 'costumes', 'are', 'remarkably', 'well', 'done', '1974', 'film', 'get', 'see', 'duels', 'foot', 'horseback', 'siege', 'Czestochowa', 'Swedes', 'Poles', 'use', 'cannons', 'bombard', 'other', 'large-scale', 'battle', 'Tartars', 'then', 'attack', 'Swedish', 'formation', 'favorite', 'be', 'cannons', 'so', 'much', 'want', 'get', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Potop', 'enjoy', 'historic', 'epics', 'movie', 'war', 'love', 'even', 'deeper', 'meanings', 'look']",N/A
546718,A25PSIGEGEL7DE,B00003TKXN,William A. Levinson,"[12, 13]","The protagonist, Andrei Kmicic, is a headstrong young man whose thoughtless violence gets him in trouble and threatens his relationship with his fiancee Olenka Billevich. When war breaks out with Sweden he swears allegiance to Janusz Radziwill, the Hetman of Lithuania. What he doesn't know is that Radziwill has conspired to betray the Commonwealth to the Swedes.Kmicic (or Kmita) goes along with Radziwill, thus earning the hatred and contempt of former comrades like Michael Wolodyjowski. Upon learning just how bad the Radziwills are, however, he changes sides in an attempt to redeem himself. Sienkiewicz has him play a central role in the siege of Czestochowa (Poland's Fort McHenry), and Sweden's failure to capture the fortress may in fact have been the turning point of the war. He also saves the King of Poland from an ambush and later plays a central role in winning a decisive battle.As shown in the book, Sienkiewicz actually meant Kmita to symbolize the unruly Polish nobility while Olenka symbolized Poland itself. Of the three books in the Trilogy, ""The Deluge"" is probably the best because of the protagonist's character development throughout the story and the epic struggle to liberate Poland from the Swedes.The film's color quality leaves something to be desired and in fact seems to become black-and-white when distant objects are involved. This is perhaps due to the fact that Poland was still under Soviet control and the quality of everything in the Eastern Bloc may have been second-rate. The story and the performances are nonetheless every bit as good if not better than any four-star epic from the black-and-white era and there are no problems with the soundtrack.",5,One of the greatest epics ever made,1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,1693,"['protagonist', 'Andrei', 'Kmicic', 'headstrong', 'young', 'man', 'thoughtless', 'violence', 'trouble', 'relationship', 'fiancee', 'Olenka', 'Billevich', 'When', 'war', 'out', 'Sweden', 'allegiance', 'Janusz', 'Radziwill', 'Hetman', 'Lithuania', 'What', ""n't"", 'know', 'Radziwill', 'conspired', 'betray', 'Commonwealth', 'Swedes.Kmicic', 'Kmita', 'Radziwill', 'thus', 'earning', 'hatred', 'contempt', 'former', 'comrades', 'Michael', 'Wolodyjowski', 'learning', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'Radziwills', 'are', 'however', 'sides', 'attempt', 'redeem', 'Sienkiewicz', 'play', 'central', 'role', 'siege', 'Czestochowa', 'Poland', 'Fort', 'McHenry', 'Sweden', 'failure', 'capture', 'fortress', 'may', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'turning', 'point', 'war', 'also', 'King', 'Poland', 'ambush', 'later', 'central', 'role', 'winning', 'decisive', 'battle.As', 'shown', 'book', 'Sienkiewicz', 'actually', 'meant', 'Kmita', 'symbolize', 'unruly', 'Polish', 'nobility', 'Olenka', 'symbolized', 'Poland', 'three', 'books', 'Trilogy', 'Deluge', 'probably', 'best', 'protagonist', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'epic', 'struggle', 'liberate', 'Poland', 'Swedes.The', 'film', 'color', 'quality', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'fact', 'become', 'black-and-white', 'when', 'distant', 'objects', 'are', 'involved', 'perhaps', 'due', 'fact', 'Poland', 'was', 'still', 'Soviet', 'control', 'quality', 'everything', 'Eastern', 'Bloc', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'second-rate', 'story', 'performances', 'are', 'nonetheless', 'bit', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'four-star', 'epic', 'black-and-white', 'era', 'are', 'problems', 'soundtrack']",N/A
