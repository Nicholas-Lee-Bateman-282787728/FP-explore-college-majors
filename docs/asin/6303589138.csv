The island in Greece is gorgeous and there's an eerie view of the New York skyline in an electrical storm, with the twin towers gleaming in the light, as well as another scene that takes place at the WTC. We will no doubt be haunted by the sight in films for years to come. The score by Stomu Yamashta is also wonderful.Paul Mazursky (who plays Bloomfield the producer, with his real life wife Betsy as Mrs. Bloomfield) has an incredible knack for casting his films, and this is an ensemble that works perfectly. Everyone shines, perhaps Raul Julia, with his priceless dance to &quot;New York, New York&quot;, the most.I should have given this 5 stars for its many merits, but I just never got to like this guy, or care about him.

I had seen stage versions of other Shakespearean plays moved from the traditional Elizabethan era to other eras. I had high hopes for this version since I had never seen the The Tempest acted before.I was disappointed in this version at the time I saw it. I will admit, I found this movie confusing. The play has dark elements and that is what is emphasized in this movie version of the play. The Tempest is supposed to be a comedy but I did not find this movie funny at all.On the other hand, it did not put me to sleep like some other movie versions of Shakespeare have done.  It's an interpretation of The Tempest that makes you think (which is why one doesn't fall asleep) instead of laugh. After seeing this movie, I decided that maybe I just did not care for this particular Shakespearean play.It didn't stink but I did not enjoy myself.Years later, I saw a live stage production of The Tempest using stage trained actors rather than movie actors. It was very funny and not at all confusing.So I have given this 2 stars because I was not bored to sleep but I have seen a much better version on stage than this movie interpretation.",2,A mixed bag,1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,1333,"['Being', 'Shakespeare', 'fan', 'junior', 'high', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'mother', 'sister', 'when', 'came', 'had', 'read', 'Tempest', 'big', 'heavy', 'annotated', 'tome', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'had', 'seen', 'stage', 'versions', 'other', 'Shakespearean', 'plays', 'moved', 'traditional', 'Elizabethan', 'era', 'other', 'eras', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'version', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Tempest', 'acted', 'before.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'version', 'time', 'saw', 'will', 'admit', 'found', 'movie', 'confusing', 'play', 'dark', 'elements', 'what', 'emphasized', 'movie', 'version', 'play', 'Tempest', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'movie', 'funny', 'other', 'hand', 'did', 'not', 'put', 'sleep', 'other', 'movie', 'versions', 'Shakespeare', 'have', 'done', 'interpretation', 'Tempest', 'think', 'why', 'one', ""n't"", 'fall', 'asleep', 'instead', 'laugh', 'seeing', 'movie', 'decided', 'maybe', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'particular', 'Shakespearean', 'play.It', 'did', ""n't"", 'stink', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'myself.Years', 'later', 'saw', 'live', 'stage', 'production', 'Tempest', 'using', 'stage', 'trained', 'actors', 'rather', 'movie', 'actors', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'not', 'confusing.So', 'have', 'given', '2', 'stars', 'was', 'not', 'bored', 'sleep', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'better', 'version', 'stage', 'movie', 'interpretation']",Tempest VHS

He moves with his daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald in her first film appearance) to a Greek island where he meets the beautiful Aretha Tomalin (Susan Sarandon in the Ariel role) and promptly hooks up with her, as they say.On hand as well is Raul Julia as Calibanos, a goatherd who exhibits one of the more representative characteristics of ""goatness"", namely, lust, but also evokes Zorba in his dancing, his use of the term ""boss"" to refer to Phil, and other stuff; he's utterly convincing as a Greek native. His name is the obvious link to the Shakespeare character.At 140 minutes, this does tend to ramble in a number of places. But Cassevetes, Sarandon, and Julia are strong enough actors to carry it and make it shine in more places than it rambles. Cassevetes' real-life wife Gena Rowlands is also here as his movie wife; their marriage breaks up, the impetus for his flight to Greece. Rowlands is also very good, as is Vittorio Gassman as Rowlands' new lover--who, as it turns out, is Phil's boss in New York City before Phil's departure. The director, Paul Mazursky, shows up as a movie producer (big stretch...).If you don't mind a laid back script that lets the characters talk about a lot of stuff that is not necessarily punchy, then this is the movie for you.

380787,ABE8YHLYSM15G,6303589138,Luke Killion,"[0, 0]","""The Tempest"" is an excellent Paul Mazursky film released in 1982.  It is loosely based on Shakespeare's play of the same name. I'm not very familiar with Shakespeare,so I don't know to what extent Mazursky adapted the original play, but this movie has alot of themes from the 60's and 70's, mainly the ""back to nature"" movement. This was a pretty regular phenomenon in the 1970's, and although this movie is was filmed in 1981, most of the style is reminiscent of the hippie generation.There is an essential clash in the lead character, Philip Demetrius, that is emblematic of the transitional period from the 70's to the 80's. Philip is a New York architect who seemingly has it all, from a swanky Manhattan apartment to a high paying job with an international business concern. Mazurksky's film clearly shows the new business culture that came into vogue during the 1980's, and Philip's refusal to conform to the staus quo of his casino building boss leads to his oncoming 'flake out', when he breaks his contractual obligations.The development of his character says alot about Mazursky's take on the whole ""drop out"" and ""back to nature"" thing that was so popular during the hippie generation. Mazursky shows two sides to his movie; his directoral use of flashbacks skip around from Philip's time in New York, to his flight from civilization to remote and sparsely inhabited Greek islands after some marital problems. Even though there are some obvious implications concerning Philip's mental health and the classic nervous breakdown, he doesn't exhibit real insanity, rather a constant frustration and disgruntlement that drives him further from his former self.Though there is an obvious culture clash in this film, it is more of a family drama than a simple story of non conformity. Philip (played by John Cassavetes) is a typical father in many respects before his move to Greece; he is overly protective of his daughter (Molly Ringwald in one of her first big screen hits), and carries responsibility for his spouse Antonia (Gena Rowlands), who is involved in Broadway productions.  The obvious question when he decides to ""give it all up"", is his ability to maintain a family life and have meaningful relationships. His life in the islands is very bohemian in a folksly Hemingwayesque style; he still has his family in mind, yet uses his authority as kind of an anti-boss; he is in charge yet there is no formal structure to their lives. It is a return to his heritage in the primitivism of the living arrangement with his daughter (who despises her mother for taking up with someone close to Philip) and his new girlfriend, Aretha (Susan Sarrandon), an American ex-pat who feels most at home in the Mediterranean. Raul Julia gives a memorable preformance as Kalibanos, a hermetical Greek goat herder who accomodates Philip and his two women. Despite the motley mix of bohemians and businessmen, the film's title has a way of revealing itself, which suddenly alters the ensemble's collective fate.",4,An architect's escape from New York,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,3007,"['Tempest', 'excellent', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'film', 'released', '1982', 'loosely', 'based', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'same', 'name', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'familiar', 'Shakespeare', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'extent', 'Mazursky', 'adapted', 'original', 'play', 'movie', 'alot', 'themes', '60', '70', 'mainly', 'back', 'nature', 'movement', 'was', 'pretty', 'regular', 'phenomenon', '1970', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', '1981', 'most', 'style', 'reminiscent', 'hippie', 'essential', 'clash', 'lead', 'character', 'Philip', 'Demetrius', 'emblematic', 'transitional', 'period', '70', '80', 'Philip', 'New', 'York', 'architect', 'who', 'seemingly', 'swanky', 'Manhattan', 'apartment', 'high', 'paying', 'job', 'international', 'business', 'concern', 'Mazurksky', 'film', 'clearly', 'new', 'business', 'culture', 'came', 'vogue', '1980', 'Philip', 'refusal', 'conform', 'staus', 'quo', 'casino', 'building', 'boss', 'oncoming', 'out', 'when', 'contractual', 'obligations.The', 'development', 'character', 'alot', 'Mazursky', 'take', 'whole', 'drop', 'out', 'back', 'nature', 'thing', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'hippie', 'generation', 'Mazursky', 'two', 'sides', 'movie', 'directoral', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'skip', 'Philip', 'time', 'New', 'York', 'flight', 'civilization', 'remote', 'sparsely', 'inhabited', 'Greek', 'islands', 'marital', 'problems', 'Even', 'are', 'obvious', 'implications', 'concerning', 'Philip', 'mental', 'health', 'classic', 'nervous', 'breakdown', ""n't"", 'exhibit', 'real', 'insanity', 'rather', 'constant', 'frustration', 'disgruntlement', 'further', 'former', 'self.Though', 'obvious', 'culture', 'clash', 'film', 'more', 'family', 'drama', 'simple', 'story', 'non', 'conformity', 'Philip', 'played', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'typical', 'father', 'many', 'respects', 'move', 'Greece', 'overly', 'protective', 'daughter', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'one', 'first', 'big', 'screen', 'hits', 'responsibility', 'spouse', 'Antonia', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'who', 'involved', 'Broadway', 'productions', 'obvious', 'question', 'when', 'give', 'up', 'ability', 'maintain', 'family', 'life', 'have', 'meaningful', 'relationships', 'life', 'islands', 'very', 'bohemian', 'folksly', 'Hemingwayesque', 'style', 'still', 'family', 'mind', 'authority', 'kind', 'anti-boss', 'charge', 'yet', 'formal', 'structure', 'lives', 'return', 'heritage', 'primitivism', 'living', 'arrangement', 'daughter', 'who', 'mother', 'taking', 'up', 'someone', 'close', 'Philip', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Aretha', 'Susan', 'Sarrandon', 'American', 'ex-pat', 'who', 'most', 'home', 'Mediterranean', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'memorable', 'preformance', 'Kalibanos', 'hermetical', 'Greek', 'goat', 'herder', 'who', 'Philip', 'two', 'women', 'motley', 'mix', 'bohemians', 'businessmen', 'film', 'title', 'way', 'revealing', 'suddenly', 'ensemble', 'collective', 'fate']",Tempest VHS

I think it has something to do with the fact that Paul Mazursky never spent any money on promting his films.  It stars John Cassavetes but his wife Gena Rowlands out shines all but one character.The cast is the best bunch of actors I have ever seen assembled to play their characters.  Besides Cassavetes and Rowlands, are Susan Saradon, Molly Ringwald in what may be her first performance, Vittorio Gassman, and Sam Robards.I said that Gena Rowlands out shines everyone but one character and that is RAUL JULIA.  This is absolutely the best I have ever seen him.  He owns this film from the moment he is on camera to the moment he is off camera.  You will fall hopelessly in love with him.The sound track by Stomu Yamashta will grab you from the first note and haunt you for weeks.  You will walk around humming the sound track.If you enjoy Gena Rowlands in this film, check out Another Woman by Woody Allen, A Woman Under the Influence by her husband John Cassavetes which also stars Peter Falk, And Opening Night starring Gena and John who also wrote and directed the film.I promise that once you are hooked on the Mazursky-Cassavetes creations you will want to own all of them.Enjoy.",5,The Tempest,1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,1285,"['impossible', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'not', 'considered', 'one', 'greatest', 'ever', 'made', 'think', 'something', 'do', 'fact', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'never', 'spent', 'money', 'promting', 'films', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'wife', 'Gena', 'out', 'shines', 'one', 'character.The', 'cast', 'best', 'bunch', 'actors', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'assembled', 'play', 'characters', 'Cassavetes', 'Rowlands', 'are', 'Susan', 'Saradon', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'performance', 'Vittorio', 'Gassman', 'Sam', 'Robards.I', 'said', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'out', 'shines', 'everyone', 'one', 'character', 'RAUL', 'JULIA', 'absolutely', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'moment', 'camera', 'moment', 'camera', 'will', 'fall', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'him.The', 'sound', 'track', 'Stomu', 'Yamashta', 'will', 'grab', 'first', 'note', 'haunt', 'weeks', 'will', 'walk', 'humming', 'sound', 'enjoy', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'Woman', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'A', 'Woman', 'Influence', 'husband', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'also', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'Opening', 'Night', 'starring', 'Gena', 'John', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film.I', 'promise', 'once', 'are', 'hooked', 'Mazursky-Cassavetes', 'creations', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'them.Enjoy']",Tempest VHS
