Although the constant threats of demotion continued these episodes, we sense relief from the Commander. Most significant, it was the efforts by a Dutch inspector - posing as Columbo, Sherlock Holmes, and Robert Goren - who forces the important issues, despite DCI Mike Hedges who wants an easier path.The spirited chemistry of these peculiar and competitive characters are countered by the murderous, physically violent acting of Brendan Coyle. It is the immense depth of acting that demands our attention. The directing and script augment these incredible episodes. Best of all, the story moves deftly and seldom stalls - unlike most of the series. Forcefully compelling, and primeval at its foundations, the two-episode saga brings us a Commander, delivered from her past decisions and delusions. She arrives as an artist, and impervious to danger she succumbs to narcissism. Finally, beloved Commander receives her transfer to another section. But, is she sober?",5,"Finally, the real Gem shows!",1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,1061,"['waited', 'not', 'entirely', 'patient', 'arrival', 'strongly', 'rewarded', 'way', 'supportive', 'cast', 'constant', 'threats', 'demotion', 'continued', 'episodes', 'sense', 'relief', 'Commander', 'Most', 'significant', 'was', 'efforts', 'Dutch', 'inspector', 'posing', 'Columbo', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Robert', 'Goren', 'who', 'important', 'issues', 'DCI', 'Mike', 'Hedges', 'who', 'easier', 'path.The', 'spirited', 'chemistry', 'peculiar', 'competitive', 'characters', 'are', 'countered', 'murderous', 'physically', 'violent', 'acting', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'immense', 'depth', 'acting', 'attention', 'directing', 'script', 'augment', 'incredible', 'episodes', 'Best', 'story', 'deftly', 'seldom', 'stalls', 'most', 'series', 'Forcefully', 'compelling', 'primeval', 'foundations', 'two-episode', 'saga', 'Commander', 'delivered', 'past', 'decisions', 'delusions', 'artist', 'impervious', 'danger', 'narcissism', 'Finally', 'beloved', 'Commander', 'transfer', 'section', 'sober']",N/A
