1043852,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B000M6D3J2,Bobby Underwood,"[1, 1]","Charlie takes his wife and always increasing brood to the circus for one of the most fun entries in the Charlie Chan franchise. A bit more amusement and humor has slipped in to the screen version of Earl Derr Biggers' famous sleuth at this point, with Warner Oland retaining the elegance of Chan while loosening up a bit, showing amusement in dealing with his most enthusiastic supporter, son Lee Chan (Keye Luke). We get to see all Charlie's offspring in this one, as well as his often mentioned wife, portrayed by Annie Mar.Charlie rarely had a setting this fun, and director Harry Lachman takes full advantage of it, creating a fun atmosphere in which our favorite detective from Hawaii can solve the good mystery concocted by screenwriters Robert Ellis and Helen Logan. Charlie brings the wife and kids to the Kinney and Gaines Circus with free tickets. Soon, one of the disliked partners is found dead, murdered by an ape someone had intentionally let loose. Son Lee keeps busy chasing pretty contortionist Su Toy (Shia Jung) while helping Pop and studying methods of the police. George and Olive Brasno are nice as the circus couple who convince Charlie to stick around with the circus till the next town and investigate.Things heat up when Nellie Farrell (Drue Layton) makes claim to half the circus by virtue of being the murdered man's wife. Marie Norman (Maxine Reiner), who loved him, isn't convinced, nor is her sweet sister Louise, whose boyfriend is one of the many suspects. Marie's knowledge leads to near tragedy and Chan sets a trap for the killer before anyone else can be harmed. An old news clipping regarding a shooting in El Paso, Texas, will prove the key to solving the case, but not before the ape is on the loose again, and Su catches Lee in drag, with little George disguised as his baby!Fun, mystery, romance, and Charlie's many children make this entry one of the best. It is also available as part of a boxed set. Real circus performers blend seamlessly with a seasoned cast, and this one will become a favorite once you see it.",5,Great Mix of Fun and Murder,1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,2059,"['Charlie', 'wife', 'always', 'increasing', 'brood', 'circus', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'entries', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'franchise', 'bit', 'more', 'amusement', 'humor', 'slipped', 'screen', 'version', 'Earl', 'Derr', 'Biggers', 'famous', 'sleuth', 'point', 'Warner', 'Oland', 'retaining', 'elegance', 'Chan', 'loosening', 'up', 'bit', 'showing', 'amusement', 'dealing', 'most', 'enthusiastic', 'supporter', 'son', 'Lee', 'Chan', 'Keye', 'Luke', 'get', 'see', 'Charlie', 'offspring', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'often', 'mentioned', 'wife', 'portrayed', 'Annie', 'Mar.Charlie', 'rarely', 'had', 'setting', 'fun', 'director', 'Harry', 'Lachman', 'full', 'advantage', 'creating', 'fun', 'atmosphere', 'favorite', 'detective', 'Hawaii', 'can', 'solve', 'good', 'mystery', 'concocted', 'screenwriters', 'Robert', 'Ellis', 'Helen', 'Logan', 'Charlie', 'wife', 'kids', 'Kinney', 'Gaines', 'Circus', 'free', 'tickets', 'Soon', 'one', 'disliked', 'partners', 'found', 'dead', 'murdered', 'ape', 'someone', 'had', 'intentionally', 'let', 'loose', 'Son', 'Lee', 'busy', 'chasing', 'pretty', 'contortionist', 'Su', 'Toy', 'Shia', 'Jung', 'helping', 'Pop', 'studying', 'methods', 'police', 'George', 'Olive', 'Brasno', 'are', 'nice', 'circus', 'couple', 'who', 'convince', 'Charlie', 'stick', 'around', 'circus', 'next', 'town', 'investigate.Things', 'heat', 'up', 'when', 'Nellie', 'Farrell', 'Drue', 'Layton', 'claim', 'circus', 'virtue', 'being', 'murdered', 'man', 'wife', 'Marie', 'Norman', 'Maxine', 'Reiner', 'who', 'loved', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'sweet', 'sister', 'Louise', 'boyfriend', 'one', 'many', 'suspects', 'Marie', 'knowledge', 'near', 'tragedy', 'Chan', 'trap', 'killer', 'anyone', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'harmed', 'old', 'news', 'clipping', 'regarding', 'shooting', 'El', 'Paso', 'Texas', 'will', 'prove', 'key', 'solving', 'case', 'not', 'ape', 'loose', 'again', 'Su', 'catches', 'Lee', 'drag', 'little', 'George', 'disguised', 'baby', 'Fun', 'mystery', 'romance', 'Charlie', 'many', 'children', 'make', 'entry', 'one', 'best', 'also', 'available', 'part', 'boxed', 'set', 'Real', 'circus', 'performers', 'blend', 'seamlessly', 'seasoned', 'cast', 'one', 'will', 'become', 'favorite', 'once', 'see']",Charlie Chan At The Circus
1043853,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B000M6D3J2,Craig Connell,"[0, 0]","I am a big fan of Charlie Chan, owning all the Warner Oland/Sidney Toler episodes I can find and enjoying them, but that doesn't mean they automatically are all wonderful. This one is okay, but disappointing considering how much better it could have been.It did have its customary comic moments with Keye Luke as Number One Son and Charlie had a ton of proverbs, but they weren't particularly profound or humorous, just so-so. One thing different was the co-starring of real-life ""small people"" circus performers, George and Olive Branso, who were okay as actors.With a setting like the circus, and with Chan's huge family all there (a dozen kids) they could have all kinds of interesting scenarios, but outside of a quick cobra scene and an ape making noise a few times, not much happened. This story was just plain flat overall until the final 10 minutes. The ending was pretty clever but it was a case of too-little, too-late.Overall, it's not a bad film but there is an ""edge"" to this murder-mystery that is missing.  This can be seen as part of the Charlie Chan Volume 2 DVD set.",3,Should Have Been More Memorable,1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,1084,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'owning', 'Warner', 'Oland/Sidney', 'Toler', 'can', 'find', 'enjoying', ""n't"", 'mean', 'automatically', 'are', 'wonderful', 'one', 'okay', 'disappointing', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been.It', 'did', 'have', 'customary', 'comic', 'moments', 'Keye', 'Luke', 'Number', 'One', 'Son', 'Charlie', 'had', 'ton', 'proverbs', 'were', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'profound', 'humorous', 'just', 'so-so', 'One', 'thing', 'different', 'was', 'co-starring', 'real-life', 'small', 'people', 'circus', 'performers', 'George', 'Olive', 'Branso', 'who', 'were', 'okay', 'actors.With', 'setting', 'circus', 'Chan', 'huge', 'family', 'there', 'dozen', 'kids', 'could', 'have', 'kinds', 'interesting', 'scenarios', 'quick', 'cobra', 'scene', 'ape', 'making', 'noise', 'few', 'times', 'not', 'much', 'happened', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'flat', 'overall', 'final', '10', 'minutes', 'ending', 'was', 'pretty', 'clever', 'was', 'case', 'too-little', 'too-late.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'edge', 'murder-mystery', 'missing', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'part', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'Volume', '2', 'DVD', 'set']",Charlie Chan At The Circus
1043854,A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,B000M6D3J2,"Donald Mitchell ""Jesus Loves You!""","[4, 4]","Charlie Chan at the Circus is one of my favorite Charlie Chan movies.  Even though I remembered the story very well (which I hadn't seen in at least 40 years), I found myself admiring the mystery and the plotting.  The acting is even more entertaining than I remembered.You have a real treat ahead of you if you haven't seen this movie before (or saw it so long ago that you cannot remember much about it).As the film opens, Charlie Chan is present with his wife and 12 children enjoying the side show at a circus.  The children are lined up in reverse height which is a good play on the photographs of Charlie's family in earlier movies in the series.  They are on vacation. The ticket taker is thrilled by the chance to collect $3.50 for such a large family, but he's disappointed when Charlie offers a free pass instead in his hat band.One of the circus's owners, Joe Kinney, read that Charlie is in town and wants to consult Charlie about some threatening letters he's been receiving. They agree to meet at 9 p.m. in the business office.  When Charlie arrives there's no one there, but there is a light inside.  Upon closer inspection, it turns out that the co-owner has been strangled and his neck broken. But how?  The office was locked and bolted on the inside.With that locked room mystery to whet his appetite, Charlie reluctantly plans to continue on to the Grand Canyon with his family until one of the circus performers pleads for him to help so that the circus people won't lose their jobs.  With the encouragement of his children and agreement of his wife, Charlie and number one son, Lee, join the investigation.Soon, there are enough motives to lead to a dozen killings.  No one liked Kinney, who was brutal to both people and animals.  The only person who liked him was a woman who stands to collect on a $50,000 insurance policy.But death's threats aren't limited to Kinney.  The killer seems determined to take out Charlie and anyone else who can provide a threat.This is an old-fashioned circus which travels by train.  Many of the scenes are set on the train or during performances.  You get an authentic feel for the old big top days by small circuses.  An elephant pushes another animal's cage. A hippopotamus is fed with a shovel.  There are some excellent high-wire acts.  I could practically smell the sawdust.Like all early Charlie Chan films, this one features some excellent dancing.  The dancers will surprise you: They are midgets (George and Olive Brasno) doing the tango.There's lots of humor as Lee falls for the Chinese contortionist and later dresses up as a mother pushing a child in a pram to track one of the suspects.The story moves fast and contains some excellent photography to match the acting.  In this restored version, the film probably looks almost as good as it did when it was first released.",5,"Great Atmosphere, Lots of Mystery, and Intriguing Detection",1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,2842,"['Charlie', 'Chan', 'Circus', 'one', 'favorite', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'movies', 'Even', 'remembered', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'least', '40', 'years', 'found', 'admiring', 'mystery', 'plotting', 'acting', 'even', 'more', 'entertaining', 'remembered.You', 'have', 'real', 'treat', 'ahead', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'saw', 'so', 'long', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'much', 'film', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'present', 'wife', '12', 'children', 'enjoying', 'side', 'show', 'circus', 'children', 'are', 'lined', 'up', 'reverse', 'height', 'good', 'play', 'photographs', 'Charlie', 'family', 'earlier', 'movies', 'series', 'are', 'vacation', 'ticket', 'taker', 'thrilled', 'chance', 'collect', '3.50', 'large', 'family', 'disappointed', 'when', 'Charlie', 'free', 'pass', 'instead', 'hat', 'band.One', 'circus', 'owners', 'Joe', 'Kinney', 'read', 'Charlie', 'town', 'consult', 'Charlie', 'threatening', 'letters', 'been', 'receiving', 'agree', 'meet', '9', 'p.m.', 'business', 'office', 'When', 'Charlie', 'one', 'there', 'light', 'inside', 'closer', 'inspection', 'out', 'co-owner', 'been', 'strangled', 'neck', 'broken', 'how', 'office', 'was', 'locked', 'bolted', 'inside.With', 'locked', 'room', 'mystery', 'whet', 'appetite', 'Charlie', 'reluctantly', 'continue', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'family', 'one', 'circus', 'performers', 'pleads', 'help', 'so', 'circus', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lose', 'jobs', 'encouragement', 'children', 'agreement', 'wife', 'Charlie', 'number', 'one', 'son', 'Lee', 'join', 'investigation.Soon', 'are', 'enough', 'motives', 'lead', 'dozen', 'killings', 'one', 'liked', 'Kinney', 'who', 'was', 'brutal', 'people', 'animals', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'liked', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'collect', '50,000', 'insurance', 'policy.But', 'death', 'threats', 'are', ""n't"", 'limited', 'Kinney', 'killer', 'determined', 'take', 'out', 'Charlie', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'can', 'provide', 'threat.This', 'old-fashioned', 'circus', 'travels', 'train', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'set', 'train', 'performances', 'get', 'authentic', 'feel', 'old', 'big', 'top', 'days', 'small', 'circuses', 'elephant', 'pushes', 'animal', 'cage', 'hippopotamus', 'fed', 'shovel', 'are', 'excellent', 'high-wire', 'acts', 'could', 'practically', 'smell', 'sawdust.Like', 'early', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'films', 'one', 'excellent', 'dancing', 'dancers', 'will', 'surprise', 'are', 'midgets', 'George', 'Olive', 'Brasno', 'doing', 'lots', 'humor', 'Lee', 'Chinese', 'contortionist', 'later', 'up', 'mother', 'pushing', 'child', 'pram', 'track', 'one', 'suspects.The', 'story', 'moves', 'fast', 'excellent', 'photography', 'match', 'acting', 'restored', 'version', 'film', 'probably', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released']",Charlie Chan At The Circus

1043856,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B000M6D3J2,Israel Drazin,"[1, 1]","Warner Oland is Charlie Chan in this 1936 film, which is part of the Cinema Classics Collection. Oland was the third actor to portray Chan in movies. He was preceded by others in 1925, 1927, and 1929. Although he played a Chinese detective, he was not Chinese. He was born in 1879 in Sweden and had some Mongolian features, which he attributed to his Russian mother.  He played in 96 films. He was Chan in sixteen, beginning 1931 until shortly before his death in 1937. He died in 1938. He frequently played Caucasians in the other films.In this movie, Chan is asked by one of two owners of a circus to find out who was sending him threatening letters. Before Chan could find out details, the man, who virtually everyone in the circus hated, was murdered in a locked room, although there was a ventilator in the ceiling. He was strangled. An ape was let loose and was suspected of the murder. The mystery in the film is interesting and the humor is delightful.As is usual in these films, Chan expresses his ideas in funny epigrams, such as the following: Too soon to count chickens until eggs are in nest. One grain of luck is sometimes more worth than whole field of oats. Cannot tell where path leads until reach end of road. An inquisitive person is like a bear after honey, sometimes finds hornet's nest.",4,A great fun mystery,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,1308,"['Warner', 'Oland', 'Charlie', 'Chan', '1936', 'film', 'part', 'Cinema', 'Classics', 'Collection', 'Oland', 'was', 'third', 'actor', 'portray', 'Chan', 'movies', 'was', 'preceded', 'others', '1925', '1927', '1929', 'played', 'Chinese', 'detective', 'was', 'not', 'Chinese', 'was', 'born', '1879', 'Sweden', 'had', 'Mongolian', 'features', 'attributed', 'Russian', 'mother', 'played', '96', 'films', 'was', 'Chan', 'sixteen', 'beginning', '1931', 'shortly', 'death', '1937', 'died', '1938', 'frequently', 'played', 'Caucasians', 'other', 'films.In', 'movie', 'Chan', 'asked', 'one', 'two', 'owners', 'circus', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'sending', 'threatening', 'letters', 'Chan', 'could', 'find', 'out', 'details', 'man', 'who', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'circus', 'hated', 'was', 'murdered', 'locked', 'room', 'was', 'ventilator', 'ceiling', 'was', 'strangled', 'ape', 'was', 'let', 'loose', 'was', 'suspected', 'murder', 'mystery', 'film', 'interesting', 'humor', 'delightful.As', 'usual', 'films', 'Chan', 'ideas', 'funny', 'epigrams', 'such', 'following', 'Too', 'soon', 'count', 'chickens', 'eggs', 'are', 'nest', 'One', 'grain', 'luck', 'sometimes', 'more', 'worth', 'whole', 'field', 'oats', 'Can', 'not', 'tell', 'where', 'path', 'reach', 'end', 'road', 'inquisitive', 'person', 'bear', 'honey', 'sometimes', 'hornet', 'nest']",Charlie Chan At The Circus

1043858,A37S3ACL57LN62,B000M6D3J2,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[0, 0]","Charlie Chan at the Circus is a typical Charlie Chan film. It starts out in a cute way; all fourteen of the Chan family enter the circus free of charge, much to the chagrin of the ticket-taker. Number One Son (Keye Luke) is enchanted with the contortionist there, but the rest of the family prefer the company of the circus ""little people"" (George and Olive Brasno). Charlie Chan (Warner Oland) is roped into making the trip a business affair when the co-owner of the circus tells him about some threatening letters he recieved. Shortly afterward, he turns up murdered. It is up to Charlie Chan and his son to solve the crime, and their methods contradict the traditional ones.Nothing overly unusual happens in this movie; it follows the usual format. The scenery is set, a murder happens, the killer is mysterious, the killer is found out. There are no overly shocking surprises or innovative strategies, but the story is quite enjoyable anyway. The characters make it so. Oland is subdued in his portrayal of the Chinese detective and delivers his trademark axioms endearingly. Luke is excitable and comic, an interesting contrast to his onscreen father. The Brasnos are a wonderful supplement to the standard cast; they only made a few films but are always memorable.",4,"""Free ticket to circus like gold ring on merry-go-round - make enjoyment double.""",1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,1270,"['Charlie', 'Chan', 'Circus', 'typical', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'film', 'out', 'cute', 'way', 'fourteen', 'Chan', 'family', 'enter', 'circus', 'free', 'charge', 'much', 'chagrin', 'ticket-taker', 'Number', 'One', 'Son', 'Keye', 'Luke', 'enchanted', 'contortionist', 'there', 'rest', 'family', 'prefer', 'company', 'circus', 'little', 'people', 'George', 'Olive', 'Brasno', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'Warner', 'Oland', 'roped', 'making', 'trip', 'business', 'affair', 'when', 'co-owner', 'circus', 'threatening', 'letters', 'recieved', 'Shortly', 'afterward', 'up', 'murdered', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'son', 'solve', 'crime', 'methods', 'contradict', 'traditional', 'ones.Nothing', 'overly', 'unusual', 'movie', 'usual', 'format', 'scenery', 'set', 'murder', 'killer', 'mysterious', 'killer', 'found', 'out', 'are', 'overly', 'shocking', 'surprises', 'innovative', 'strategies', 'story', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'anyway', 'characters', 'make', 'so', 'Oland', 'subdued', 'portrayal', 'Chinese', 'detective', 'trademark', 'axioms', 'endearingly', 'Luke', 'excitable', 'comic', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'onscreen', 'father', 'Brasnos', 'are', 'wonderful', 'supplement', 'standard', 'cast', 'only', 'made', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'always', 'memorable']",Charlie Chan At The Circus
