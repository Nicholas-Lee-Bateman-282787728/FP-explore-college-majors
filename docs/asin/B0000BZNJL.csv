I certainly felt more emotion from the characters than I do with most Hollywood movies. I especially like how much the movie just embraced the culture of the characters and was not afraid to include some religious dialogue. It wasn't anything preachy, but religion was obviously an important part of the society the characters lived in and the screenwriters were not afraid to show that the main characters were devout. Compared to American movies where religion in entertainment is practically taboo (unless you're lampooning it), this was very refreshing, even if the characters and I didn't share the same religion. The subtitles were pretty readable. I hope they bring more of these Bollywood movies to America and English speaking audiences. Remind them that it's good acting, well written dialogue, and thought provoking story that makes a good movie, not sex and explosions.",5,Good Movie!,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,1017,"['was', 'surprised', 'really', 'liked', 'bit', 'hokey', 'times', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'most', 'sense', 'acting', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'certainly', 'felt', 'more', 'emotion', 'characters', 'do', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'especially', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'just', 'embraced', 'culture', 'characters', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'include', 'religious', 'dialogue', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'preachy', 'religion', 'was', 'obviously', 'important', 'part', 'society', 'characters', 'lived', 'screenwriters', 'were', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'devout', 'Compared', 'American', 'movies', 'where', 'religion', 'entertainment', 'practically', 'taboo', ""'re"", 'lampooning', 'was', 'very', 'refreshing', 'even', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'share', 'same', 'religion', 'subtitles', 'were', 'pretty', 'readable', 'hope', 'bring', 'more', 'Bollywood', 'movies', 'America', 'English', 'speaking', 'audiences', 'Remind', 'good', 'acting', 'well', 'written', 'dialogue', 'thought', 'provoking', 'story', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'sex', 'explosions']",N/A

"" A lot of people say Koi Mil Gaya is basically ET + FORREST GUMP. This is not untrue. Hrithik's character as Rohit was as likable as a character can get. I think I cried for a good three minutes in the film and later in the film, ALSO , felt this adrenaline flow through me.Koi Mil Gaya is more than a Sci-Fiction. It is more than a film made for all audiences. It is more than any film Bollywood promises. I came out of the theater with more than just a smile. I seldom construe to such an overtly explicit display of ""goodness"" There is a rage in Hrithik's performance that overwhelms you more than once and soon you lose count.It is not in the songs. It is not in the casting. It is not in the character of the alien. Nor is it the actress. It's all about Hrithik and what one man can do. This film was a huge risk that paid off.

771737,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0000BZNJL,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","So, this is what a Bollywood sci-fi musical is like. Not bad. KOI...MIL Gaya (translates to ""I Found Someone"") may be 2 hours and 45 minutes long, but it's worth investing the time to see it. Yes, absolutely, it draws from movies the likes of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE 3RD KIND, CHARLY, and even THE ABSENT MINDED PROFESSOR, and, in the case of E.T., even plagiarizes it. Nevertheless, KOI...MIL GAYA ends up being charming and involving, thanks largely to the film's not-so-secret ingredient, Hrithik Roshan, Bollywood's biggest heartthrob. Roshan again proves that not only is he a buff, good looking guy with an arsenal of dance moves, he can act, too.KOI...MIL GAYA tells the story of Rohit (Hrithik Roshan), a mentally retarded young man. Rohit is raised by his loving and fiercely protective mother (Rekha). But his subpar intelligence allows him to feel only comfortable in the company of children, his school mates, in fact. A child in a man's body, Rohit is considered a freak and is often dismissed by his teachers and accosted by bullies, none more relentless than Raj, the cocky, bike riding son of the district magistrate. Things come to a head between Raj and Rohit with the arrival of the beautiful Nisha (PreityZinta), who befriends Rohit, to Raj's displeasure.After several musical interludes, wherein this friendship is cemented, Rohit and Nisha goof around and activate a computer which belonged to Rohit's scientist father, who had been attempting to make contact with extra terrestrial life forms. Sho nuff, it's not long before the aliens respond and then come for a visit. The space ship (nicely rendered by CG) kills off electrical power, appears in the sky line, hovers, lands somewhere, and then takes off. But they strand one of their own, who soon has an encounter with Rohit. Rohit and the little, blue being, quickly named Jadoo (meaning ""magic""), become fast friends. Jadoo does indeed have powers, the source of which is sunlight, and he's generous with granting temporary skills to his newly met pals. In the case of Rohit, Jadoo proves to be very generous and gifts him with intelligence. But Rohit's newfound happiness is derailed by the police/military and predatory scientists from the Space Research Center, who suspect that an alien is lurking about and desperately want custody of it.Hrithik Roshan makes the movie. He does something different here but superbly pulls off his unusual role. His performance is appealing, sensitive, and even heartbreaking. Thoroughly sinking into the part of Rohit, Hrithik convincingly takes on childish mannerisms and expressions, a gleeful (kind of annoying) laugh, and an awkward gait. When he is sad or being bullied, he demonstrates a tearful vulnerability which is wrenching to see. I couldn't help but feel good for Rohit as he becomes smart and begins getting back at his tormentors. Conversely, it was distressing to see Rohit faced with Jadoo's departure and the resulting loss of his intelligence. It's really not fair that, on top of his other attributes, this guy can also act so well. I want to hate him, just on general principles (he's good looking; me, not so much), but when he's upholding his craft so well, I have to give him massive respect.Preity Zinta is excellent as Nisha, whose feelings for Rohit initially stem from friendship and concern but then becomes something deeper. In her interactions with him, she toes the line of showing genuine kindness without being patronizing. Rekha, by the way, is also very good as Rohit's long suffering mom. Good job also to the kid actors who played Rohit's playmates. The filmmakers were obviously cognizant that having kids around makes it always easier to access that sense of wonder, which is key when you're viewing a film with fantasy or sci-fi elements.The special effects are cheesy, but thankfully not so horrendous as to take away from the good vibes engendered in the film. The space ship looks decent, but that's about it. In depicting Rohit's superhuman feats, it's obvious that a ton of wire work was utilized, and shabby wire work, at that. As someone really into basketball, I found the hoops showdown between Rohit and his pre-adolescent allies and Raj and his thuggish cronies to be laughable and, well, very fake. It was obvious that Hrithik doesn't play hoops a lot. Same thing with the unconvincing fight scenes and some of the dance sequences. So, lame wire work, fellas, but, no worries, I still dig the movie.Not only is KOI...MIL GAYA a sci-fi flick, it's also a cinematic blend of tender romance, music, high drama, action thriller, and slapstick comedy. It enmeshes you in a world of infinite possibilities, steadfast friendships, breathtaking sceneries, and rapturous singing and dancing. By the way, there's nothing like watching a cute, blue space alien get caught up in a Bollywood musical number. If you can forgive the dated synthetic score, the cheesy f/x, and the blatant movie ripoffs (I still cringe at the opening credits), KOI...MIL GAYA will be a rewarding cinematic experience (but that basketball game still irks me...).If you don't know yet, there's a great sequel to KOI...MIL GAYA. KRRISH, a blockbuster at the Indian cinemas in 2006 and touted as India's first superhero film, chronicles the story of Rohit and Nisha's prodigious son Krishna (also played by Hrithik Roshan). It also has an extended cameo of Rohit (again, Hrithik). So, by all means, get your hands on that one, too.",4,Indian cinema has a mothership and it's worth hopping onboard,1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,5464,"['So', 'what', 'Bollywood', 'sci-fi', 'musical',

They did their best and have gone for cute but the whole blue thing is a bit cutesy.Apart from this I'm giving 5 stars just for Hrithik's performance as the developmentally retarded young adult. It is one of the best renditions of someone 'different' by someone adult and of normal intellect I've seen - and he doesnt skip a beat. I see recently that he was a special child/adolescent himself but under treatment for a stammer. His rocket to success in about all movie areas is then even more astonishing. This character needs a warm and open heart and Hrithik's own personality perhaps shines this through well.Put this together with Dhoom 2 and then Jodha Akbar and you can see what a great acting range he has. Preity Zinta is also very good.This movie is for the adult with a child in his heart. It relives the sort of ground ET travelled but isn't a copy of that plot.

771740,A3KUGUD8Y98CPC,B0000BZNJL,"Robert A. Williams ""political ethnographer""","[4, 6]","This Bollywood film's maker said it was pure coincidence that his film mirrored parts of many Hollywood films.  For example, Jadoo resembles E.T, but Rohit is not Forrest Gump.  If Rohit is anyone, Rohit was the mentally-retarded character in ""Flowers for Algernon"" who achieved a normal intellect only to lose it again.  The bullies pestering Rohit seem to mirror the bullies who were after Daniel""san"" in ""The Karate Kid"".  The Three Stooges-type slap-stick comedy where Rohit wipes up the basketball court with the bullies is unrealistic and a bit irritating.  In short, it seemed that the film's maker thought this was his one and only chance to make a film and so he tried everything in film-making that he could think of.That said, this was a great film that appeals to young and old alike.  Rohit's mother is a great actress in addition to being extremely famous in the Indian subcontinent.  This film should be classified as a musical because there were many songs of traditional Bollywood length, but it is also a drama, sci-fi, romance, and comedy.  It's pretty amazing how all those genres were put into one film.  Most of the film is subtitled because most of the characters speak Hindi, except for the European scientists who speak English.  The subtitles did not detract from the film's ability to captivate an audience.The plot revolves around a special needs kid who should have been brilliant had his Mom not been in a car accident after his father, who was driving, was distracted by a UFO.  The resulting car crash killed the kid's father and left the kid brain-damaged. When the UFO returns years later and accidentally leaves behind Jadoo, he repairs the brain damage that Rohit suffered.  But that damage can only stay healed as long as Jadoo is there.  It is a heart-wrenching scene when Jadoo's people return for him and Rohit must return to his challenged condition.I really like this film; it's cute. Yeh movie bahut achee hai. However parents should be cautioned that there is inappropriate public displays of affection between adult characters in this film and there is a scene in a nightclub involving alcohol beverages.  I think this negative Hollywood behaviour was included because this Indian film was shot on location in Canada rather than India.

771743,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B0000BZNJL,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[2, 2]","Okay, after flirting with the idea of trying to curb the obsession rapidly taking control of my life I've submitted to a severe relapse. Forget the Borg when it comes to Hrithik Roshan, ""Resistance is Futile."" The only thing to do is sit back and just let it ride. Anyway my only vices are films, music, and chocolate. At least This won't make me fat. Okay, I'm not sure why but I kept tearing up all through this movie. Even more so than when I watchGuzaarish (English Subtitles)I think it's because I start crying from the happy moments and the heartbreaking ones.Okay, Okay, I admit it, this movie is A LOT like ET. But with all due respect to Mr. Spielberg, (whom I have a great deal of respect and admiration for) I like this one better. First of all, the kids aren't quite as bratty and mean. They pull a few mischievous pranks and parents be warned the munchkins do beat up some grownups. I'll be tossing out a few lectures to my Nephews and the soon-to-be-born Niece about how such behavior WILL NOT fly with their Auntie so they shouldn't bother.Second, Jadoo is so much cooler than ET. Not because he's cute, blue, and a little like the tadpole in that old children's show Gulla Gulla Island, but because he has such a distinct personality. You don't have to depend on the human's actions and reactions to know what Jadoo's all about.Third, ET doesn't have Rohit. Once again the Jr. Roshan has cooked up a bit of enchantment. Yes, dad is responsible too but I'll get to him later. To be fair there is ONE other actor who could have pulled this off well, and that's Aamir Khan. Still, I can't imagine anyone else in this role. I love watching a movie when it's so obvious that the actor LOVES not only his job, but the character as well. Rohit is special character to play and Mr. Roshan doesn't just play the role to his typical standards of perfection, he infuses his own enthusiasm for the character in every frame. Playing characters with any disability is a challenge for a ""normal"" person. There's the risk of being patronizing, or worse insulting, then there's the risk that the audience will only see the ""disability"" and not the person. (Something I know well in my own life)There are three things Mr. Roshan does that prevents these things from happening...1. He never once manipulates the audience into pitying Rohit. He doesn't pity Rohit, so we don't pity Rohit. When we meet Rohit pre-Jadoo, he's not unaware that he's different, but he lives the life he has to the fullest. Wisely, Mr. Roshan never goes for ""cute"" or ""pathetic"" when it comes to Rohit's personality or his challenges. Rohit is innocent, sweet, and good-hearted, but he is not saintly, or foolish. Post-Jadoo, he's very much the same, only develops a much keener sense sarcasm and confidence. The thing to remember is that Rohit isn't stupid and Mr. Roshan makes sure we know that.2. Rohit isn't hung up on being normal in the sense that he wants to be like the other young men in his city, (and since the men in his city are jerks this is evidence of his good sense) however, his frustration with the injustices he faces is palpable. Even post-Jadoo he's still a bit awkward, and his attempts at being a stud are comical. The beauty of Rohit is that healed or not, he's always true to himself, and that is a beautiful thing.3. As I mentioned before, Rohit isn't saintly, and when he does wrong it's dealt with properly. He has a temper, he's impatient, and he's impulsive. The easy thing to do is let these flaws slide because of all the other stuff he deals with. Thankfully they do no such thing!All in all, it's no wonder that out of a career jammed with exceptional roles, and exquisitely crafted performances it's this one that propelled him from Hearthrob hunk to the most serious threat to the Khan Triumvirate B-Town has seen in the last 25 years. And this was just the first step.So now that we've got the obvious out of the way, time to move on to the ladies...Rekha, the mysterious and eccentric superstar, no make that legend of Hindi films. Man oh man, if *half* of the rumors are true she could give Bette Davis, Dietrich, Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow, and Greta Garbo a run for their money. But the lady adores her privacy so we fans can only speculate. One thing is certain she takes a great deal of pride in the fact that she babysat a tiny Hrithik and changed his diapers! No lie look it up on youtube, she presented his award forJodhaa Akbar (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)she even told the whole story! He took it with exceptionally good grace. Still, I can't help but think that she used it in her powerhouse performance. She blends tenderness, sternness, vulnerability, strength, and fear into a complete package.Preity Zina, well she's her usual spunky, spirited, take-no-crud or prisoners self. I admit, sometimes I wish she'd switch it up a bit, but it works here to great effect. As the wonderful reviewer Mr. H. Bala mentions in his own exquisite review, Nisha is never patronizing with Rohit, and gives him all the dignity and respect he deserves. She never hides the truth from him, and treats him like a man, even if pre-Jadoo he is a little ""slow-on-the-uptake"" when it comes to male/female relationships. The most wonderful aspect of her performance was her dancing! Usually, in her films dancing isn't a huge deal, but here she struts her stuff quite adequately. Of course, she plays second fiddle to Mr. Roshan when it comes to busting a move but, who doesn't, right?Kids, I adore the whole flock of them. Each had a separate and distinct personality that showed a different characteristic that attracted them to Rohit, and Rohit to them. Every last child deserves praise especially the kid who played young Rohit.Bad Guys, Don't know their names, don't really care. They did the job, and made me cry with Rohit.Production and Director, See I told you we'd get to daddy Roshan! Mr. R.R. is a very talented man, yes he rips off E.T. and several other sources too, but that's par for the course in all films. Just going off of Netflix 99% of all the Foreign Movies are rip-offs of something. What I appreciated is his ability to create a wholesome and sweet story that stays true to his culture and yet remains accessible for anyone. It's not so cloyingly sweet that an adult gets sick of it. It's not so bogged down with cultural differences that my family would be asking me to explain something every five minutes. It's got bright colors and catchy music for the babies that can't follow plots yet, but it's challenging enough for kids with more advanced minds who get bored with typical children's fare. It's not easy to make a movie for an entire family these days and yes that takes talent! Besides, just making a sci-fi movie where sci-fi isn't exactly the most popular genre takes a certain amount of guts. And here's something you might have missed. Mr. R.R. was an actor back in the day and he returned in front of the camera as Dr. Mehra, Rohit's father. Kudos, Mr. R.R.Okay I'll be honest if you're one of those special effects junkies looking for computer images to rival what we get here in the States, you'll be disappointed. Sorry but India doesn't have the cash for that kind of work. 1,000,000 rupees = 18,000 US dollars! Now I ask you, would that hire a company like LucasArts for a week? I rest my case. I'd say the special effects are on par with ""The Abyss"" and guess what, I love that movie and the effects too! The wirework wasn't as bad as I expected either. Also, remember this movie was made almost 10 years ago, so give it a chance and don't be snobby!Costumes, Okay Hrithik Roshan is a VERY, VERY, GOOD SON! I think this needs emphasizing because daddy put him in some truly heinous outfits post-Jadoo. Oye! I really can't possibly understand what the costume designer could have been thinking! This is when you just shrug and accept the fact that it doesn't matter what you do to Hrithik Roshan be it hair, glasses, or wardrobe, the man is The Greek God of Bollywood and will never look bad. However, there were two dresses Ms. Zina wore that I would die for. But once again the Bollywood shoe monster appeared with horrific sandals and other monstrosities. It's official, Bollywood films have only gotten truly fashionable from 2006 on.Locations, I've yet to see even one part of India on film that isn't completely breathtaking. Since a great deal of the film takes place outside we are visually spoiled as usual.Music and dance. Uncle Rajesh Roshan did extremely well with this soundtrack I like it a lot more thanKaho Naa Pyaar Hai Bollywood DVD (With English Subtitles)andNa Tum Jaano Na Humbut he's still not my favorite composer. Dancing, well what can I say Mr. Roshan had his Singing In The Rain moment, and I think Gene Kelly would have heartily approved.To sum up, I honestly didn't think it'd live up to the hype but it did!",5,"Heart, Soul, and HOLY SMOKE!",1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,8888,"['Okay', 'flirting', 'idea', 'trying', 'curb', 'obsession', 'rapidly', 'taking', 'control', 'life', ""'ve"", 'submitted',
