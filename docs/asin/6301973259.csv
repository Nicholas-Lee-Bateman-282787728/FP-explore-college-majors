The conversation tells about their culture. Marty should be ashamed, all his younger brothers and sisters are married with children. No one seems worried about jobs or tuition costs. What to do on a Saturday night? ""What do you feel like doing tonight?"" [Could the movies of that time tell what those boys wanted to do?] Unmarried children lived at home until marriage. People mostly walked in those days. People had problems with in-laws. [Has that changed?] Where can a bachelor meet girls? [No mention of churches or relatives to make matches.] A butcher could own his own store, no problems with large corporations. [Ever see a skinny butcher?]The Starlight Ballroom is a place to meet prospective spouses, not one-night stands. [What about local neighborhoods? In some places people find mates in high schools.] Do their conversations seem real or comic? Do appearances count more than character? Then or now, a mother-in-law can be a problem for a young couple. Caterina's speech tells about her personality. ""These are the worst days of my life."" There's nothing like a cheerful personality in a home. Marty's voluble speech betrays his nervousness, and his pleasure. An elevated train runs in the background. People are afraid of being lonely, away from familiar surroundings. Note the cobblestone pavement.Marty discussed his plans with Clara. ""Go ahead and buy the butcher shop."" Marty has plans to meet the competition from chain stores. Angie searches for Marty. ""That's a sad story."" Is Marty the kindest man Carla ever met? What about New Year's Eve? Does what they teach in the university work in the real world? Carla tells her parents about her decision. Catarina's departure results in problems for Tommy and Virginia. [There is humor in the conversations.] The boys talk about Mickey Spillane's novels as if they were real life. There is more humor in their conversations. People watch Ed Sullivan on Sunday night. Then Marty decides to take action in his own best interest, and not listen to the advice from strangers. The ending is open ended, as if to provide for a sequel or a TV series. But it never happened. The film mentions relatives who have moved away, but not their replacements.This low-budget movie was a surprise hit. It dealt with the world of the average person and did not smirk or patronize. This was a change from the politics of the time that avoided films about ordinary Americans. But no film dealt with the life of people in rural America.",5,Life in the Big City,1236297600,"03 6, 2009",2009,2609,"['film', 'busy', 'city', 'street', 'People', 'walk', 'wearing', 'casual', 'dress', 'day', 'meat', 'prices', 'date', 'film', 'conversation', 'tells', 'culture', 'Marty', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'younger', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'are', 'married', 'children', 'one', 'worried', 'jobs', 'tuition', 'costs', 'What', 'do', 'Saturday', 'night', 'What', 'do', 'feel', 'doing', 'tonight', '[', 'Could', 'movies', 'time', 'tell', 'what', 'boys', 'wanted', 'do', ']', 'Unmarried', 'children', 'lived', 'home', 'marriage', 'People', 'mostly', 'walked', 'days', 'People', 'had', 'problems', 'in-laws', '[', 'changed', ']', 'Where', 'can', 'bachelor', 'meet', 'girls', '[', 'mention', 'churches', 'relatives', 'make', 'matches', ']', 'butcher', 'could', 'own', 'own', 'store', 'problems', 'large', 'corporations', '[', 'Ever', 'see', 'skinny', 'butcher', 'Starlight', 'Ballroom', 'place', 'meet', 'prospective', 'spouses', 'not', 'one-night', 'stands', '[', 'What', 'local', 'neighborhoods', 'places', 'people', 'find', 'mates', 'high', 'schools', ']', 'Do', 'conversations', 'seem', 'real', 'comic', 'Do', 'count', 'more', 'character', 'Then', 'now', 'mother-in-law', 'can', 'be', 'problem', 'young', 'couple', 'Caterina', 'speech', 'personality', 'are', 'worst', 'days', 'life', 'nothing', 'cheerful', 'personality', 'home', 'Marty', 'voluble', 'speech', 'nervousness', 'pleasure', 'elevated', 'train', 'runs', 'background', 'People', 'are', 'afraid', 'being', 'lonely', 'away', 'familiar', 'surroundings', 'Note', 'cobblestone', 'pavement.Marty', 'discussed', 'plans', 'Clara', 'Go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'butcher', 'shop', 'Marty', 'plans', 'meet', 'competition', 'chain', 'stores', 'Angie', 'searches', 'Marty', 'sad', 'story', 'Marty', 'kindest', 'man', 'Carla', 'ever', 'met', 'What', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'what', 'teach', 'university', 'work', 'real', 'world', 'Carla', 'parents', 'decision', 'Catarina', 'departure', 'results', 'problems', 'Tommy', 'Virginia', '[', 'humor', 'conversations', ']', 'boys', 'talk', 'Mickey', 'Spillane', 'novels', 'were', 'real', 'life', 'more', 'humor', 'conversations', 'People', 'watch', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Sunday', 'night', 'Then', 'Marty', 'take', 'action', 'own', 'best', 'interest', 'not', 'listen', 'advice', 'strangers', 'ending', 'open', 'ended', 'provide', 'sequel', 'TV', 'series', 'never', 'happened', 'film', 'mentions', 'relatives', 'who', 'have', 'moved', 'away', 'not', 'replacements.This', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'was', 'surprise', 'hit', 'world', 'average', 'person', 'did', 'not', 'smirk', 'patronize', 'was', 'change', 'politics', 'time', 'avoided', 'films', 'ordinary', 'Americans', 'film', 'dealt', 'life', 'people', 'rural', 'America']",Marty VHS

284220,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301973259,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","`Marty' was, for me, a completely unexpected surprise of a film.  I had gathered an impression from friends that it was a lightweight and undeserving Oscar nominee, and knowing that it won four of them (Lead Actor, Best Picture, Director and Writing) in a year crowded with weightier and more prestige projects like `The Rose Tattoo' or `East of Eden' made me wonder just what was so special about this little film about a frumpy man looking for love.`Marty' is a treasure, and Borgnine's performance is just wonderful.The film tells the story of a butcher in his early 30's who is overweight and somewhat boorish looking.  He can't seem to find a girl who is interested in him and he is continually pestered by the people he meets and by his very own mother, whom he happens to live with, to get himself married.  His younger siblings are already married, with child even, but Marty is still alone.  Then Marty meets a `dog' of sorts named Clara.  She has just been ditched by her blind date and is emotionally crushed, but when she meets Marty her night turns around and the two of them hit it off really well.  They talk and talk and talk and make plans to meet up again the next night.Could this be everything Marty has been waiting for?The great thing about `Marty' is that it remains feeling light and airy while giving unexpected depth to the central theme of loneliness, making some very profound observations.  The intersecting storyline concerning Marty's mother and her initial determination to marry off Marty and then her resolve to keep him single is beautifully fleshed out through a few key sequences and gives `Marty' a depth I didn't expect.  Even the plot points surrounding Marty's best friend Angie are essential to combing through another aspect or another variation of loneliness, for Angie realizes that Marty's happiness may eventually lead to Angie's abandonment.The cast is all equipped with the goods and delivers a beautifully paced film thanks to their wonderful performances.  I'm not in total agreement with Joe Mantell's performance, namely because I didn't see anything special with his rendering of Angie's scenes.  It was more the writing that was responsible for that conveyance.  That said, Borgnine, Betsy Blair and Esther Minciotti are all wonderful, delivering performances that bleed through the screen and imprint themselves on our mind's eye.`Marty' hit me in all the right places; proving that some of life's biggest treasures come in packages we least expect.",5,A tale of loneliness giving considerable depth...,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,2505,"['Marty', 'was', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'film', 'had', 'gathered', 'impression', 'friends', 'was', 'lightweight', 'undeserving', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'knowing', 'won', 'four', 'Lead', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Writing', 'year', 'crowded', 'weightier', 'more', 'prestige', 'projects', 'Rose', 'Tattoo', 'East', 'Eden', 'made', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'special', 'little', 'film', 'frumpy', 'man', 'looking', 'love.', 'Marty', 'treasure', 'Borgnine', 'performance', 'just', 'wonderful.The', 'film', 'story', 'butcher', 'early', '30', 'who', 'overweight', 'somewhat', 'boorish', 'looking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'girl', 'who', 'interested', 'continually', 'pestered', 'people', 'very', 'own', 'mother', 'whom', 'live', 'get', 'married', 'younger', 'siblings', 'are', 'already', 'married', 'child', 'even', 'Marty', 'still', 'alone', 'Then', 'Marty', 'dog', 'sorts', 'named', 'Clara', 'just', 'been', 'ditched', 'blind', 'date', 'emotionally', 'crushed', 'when', 'Marty', 'night', 'around', 'two', 'hit', 'off', 'really', 'well', 'talk', 'talk', 'talk', 'make', 'plans', 'meet', 'up', 'again', 'next', 'night.Could', 'be', 'everything', 'Marty', 'been', 'waiting', 'great', 'thing', 'Marty', 'feeling', 'light', 'airy', 'giving', 'unexpected', 'depth', 'central', 'theme', 'loneliness', 'making', 'very', 'profound', 'observations', 'intersecting', 'storyline', 'concerning', 'Marty', 'mother', 'initial', 'determination', 'marry', 'off', 'Marty', 'then', 'resolve', 'keep', 'single', 'beautifully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'few', 'key', 'sequences', 'Marty', 'depth', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Even', 'plot', 'points', 'surrounding', 'Marty', 'best', 'friend', 'Angie', 'are', 'essential', 'combing', 'aspect', 'variation', 'loneliness', 'Angie', 'Marty', 'happiness', 'may', 'eventually', 'lead', 'Angie', 'abandonment.The', 'cast', 'equipped', 'goods', 'delivers', 'beautifully', 'paced', 'film', 'thanks', 'wonderful', 'performances', ""'m"", 'not', 'total', 'agreement', 'Joe', 'Mantell', 'performance', 'namely', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'special', 'rendering', 'Angie', 'scenes', 'was', 'more', 'writing', 'was', 'responsible', 'conveyance', 'said', 'Borgnine', 'Betsy', 'Blair', 'Esther', 'Minciotti', 'are', 'wonderful', 'delivering', 'performances', 'bleed', 'screen', 'imprint', 'mind', 'eye.', 'Marty', 'hit', 'right', 'places', 'proving', 'life', 'biggest', 'treasures', 'come', 'packages', 'least', 'expect']",Marty VHS

More often than not, I laughed so hard because I found everything about it to be uproariously hilarious. Here is an insufferable bore (I can also substitute ""pathetic boob"" here too) who uses the ""woe is me"" shtick on a loser girl. She falls for him, and everything is all easy peasy. They both have a cry, and the motormouth just can't stop talking about how his life is tragic. When Marty is back on his turf with his pathetic relatives and fake friends, they throw around so much useless gossip that life feels pretty hollow to me with these lame, hopeless losers. It's a very cyclic quotidian. What's sad and surprising about the theme is that it's absolutely alive today in the real world. One interesting aspect is how people who develop so many unfounded opinions about something or somebody even though they hardly know it or the person. It's true with them that there is a saying, ""First impressions are everything."" Like I care. Anyhow, the film is surprisingly realistic and germane. Unfortunately, I am the kind of a person who avoids that type of life like the plague. That's why I laughed so hard during Marty. I understand if others think Marty is a superb picture, and I don't have a problem with it. Frankly, let's be real: Marty is a film for losers because they can relate so well with it. That's why the poor Herb famously feigned ignorance when asked which film won the Best Picture of 1955. By the way, I also hate New York pictures; I find them overly dramatic, and it is very evident in Marty. Almost every scene in it is too melodramatic to the point of being hysterical. To come to think of New York pictures, I feel there is an interesting similarity between Marty and Tony Manero of Saturday Night Fever. Both have loser friends, are stuck with bland relatives, see their lives aren't going anywhere much, and are surrounded with so much negativity. So, they use something else to channel their escape: a girl for Marty and dancing for Tony. As much as I like Ernest Borgnine, he shouldn't have won the Oscar that year. The incomparable Marlon Brando won it the year before in what is one of the most incredible performance ever. Instead of Ernest Borgnine, James Dean should have nabbed it for his incredible, sui generis performance in The East of Eden. Sorry, I don't agree with the ""dog"" comment about Betsy Blair who is a nice looking gal in the film. That's why Gene Kelly was married to her that time. All in all, Marty is too weird for me, but in all honesty, it's not bad of a picture although I can see today why it's a forgotten Best Picture winner.",4,I Laughed So Hard Throughout at These Poor Boobs.,1395619200,"03 24, 2014",2014,2649,"['Viewed', '3/14Rate', '73/14', 'Marty', 'weird', 'experience', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'found', 'everything', 'be', 'uproariously', 'hilarious', 'Here', 'insufferable', 'bore', 'can', 'also', 'substitute', 'pathetic', 'boob', 'here', 'too', 'who', 'woe', 'shtick', 'loser', 'girl', 'everything', 'easy', 'peasy', 'have', 'cry', 'motormouth', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'talking', 'how', 'life', 'tragic', 'When', 'Marty', 'back', 'turf', 'pathetic', 'relatives', 'fake', 'friends', 'throw', 'so', 'much', 'useless', 'gossip', 'life', 'feels', 'pretty', 'hollow', 'lame', 'hopeless', 'losers', 'very', 'cyclic', 'quotidian', 'What', 'sad', 'surprising', 'theme', 'absolutely', 'alive', 'today', 'real', 'world', 'One', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'develop', 'so', 'many', 'unfounded', 'opinions', 'something', 'somebody', 'even', 'hardly', 'know', 'person', 'true', 'saying', 'First', 'impressions', 'are', 'everything', 'care', 'Anyhow', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'realistic', 'germane', 'Unfortunately', 'am', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'type', 'life', 'plague', 'why', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'Marty', 'understand', 'others', 'think', 'Marty', 'superb', 'picture', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'Frankly', 'let', 'be', 'real', 'Marty', 'film', 'losers', 'can', 'relate', 'so', 'well', 'why', 'poor', 'Herb', 'famously', 'feigned', 'ignorance', 'when', 'asked', 'film', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', '1955', 'way', 'also', 'hate', 'New', 'York', 'find', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'very', 'evident', 'Marty', 'Almost', 'scene', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'point', 'being', 'hysterical', 'come', 'think', 'New', 'York', 'feel', 'interesting', 'similarity', 'Marty', 'Tony', 'Manero', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'have', 'loser', 'friends', 'are', 'stuck', 'bland', 'relatives', 'see', 'lives', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'anywhere', 'much', 'are', 'surrounded', 'so', 'much', 'negativity', 'So', 'use', 'something', 'else', 'channel', 'escape', 'girl', 'Marty', 'dancing', 'Tony', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'year', 'incomparable', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'won', 'year', 'before', 'what', 'one', 'most', 'incredible', 'performance', 'ever', 'Instead', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'James', 'Dean', 'should', 'have', 'nabbed', 'incredible', 'sui', 'generis', 'performance', 'East', 'Eden', 'Sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'dog', 'comment', 'Betsy', 'Blair', 'who', 'nice', 'looking', 'gal', 'film', 'why', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'was', 'married', 'time', 'Marty', 'too', 'weird', 'honesty', 'not', 'bad', 'picture', 'can', 'see', 'today', 'why', 'forgotten', 'Best', 'Picture', 'winner']",Marty VHS

It is also a story that many people can identify with, the story of  the ugly duckling, but set in the Bronx. The multi-layered screenplay  presents us with entertaining dialogue, but it is also more real, less  'Hollywoodized' without any snappy dialogue or catchy phrases. There is  also a secondary, more beautiful under-story about soul-mates, the idea  that physical beauty is not that important and that people who have things  in common are more likely to live a happy relationship. But the thing that  makes 'Marty' special, other than the timeless story, is Ernest Borgine's  timeless performance as the lonely butcher with a heart of gold, he creates  a unique character than anyone can sympathize with, his performance is the  basic thing that keeps the movie going.

Markel,"[4, 4]","This review is for the 2001 MGM DVD.Ernest Borgnine stars as Marty Piletti, a 34 year old marginally overweight bachelor who has no shortage of male friends but has yet to meet Mrs. Right.  He still lives at home with his mother who keeps brow beating him into finding a nice girl and getting married.  Marty has gotten so tired of the singles hangouts that he seems to be giving up any hope of getting married.  Finally, he decides to go to the Stardust ballroom with one of his pals and his fate changes when he meets a plain looking girl named Clara Snyder (Betsy Blair).  This sets up the rest of the film for a very memorable evening between Marty and Clara.The movie is a no-frills production filmed in black and white in various parts of the Bronx in the mid-1950's with very plain, and at the time, mostly unheard of actors.  The movie is a radical departure from typical Hollywood romances where the men are strong, witty and handsome, while the women are beautiful and charming, while both are usually impeccably dressed and typically members of high society.  This movie doesn't have any of that and is enormously effective as it shows an honest depiction of how true romance is in real life.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film and highly recommend it.The DVD quality was just OK due to intermittent tiny specs of film deterioration throughout the movie plus a few scenes didn't have that sharp, digitally restored look to them.  The sound is fine and the only bonus is a trailer hosted by Burt Lancaster.Movie: ADVD Quality: B-",5,Perhaps the best true-to-real-life romance on film.,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,1536,"['review', '2001', 'MGM', 'DVD.Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Marty', 'Piletti', '34', 'year', 'old', 'marginally', 'overweight', 'bachelor', 'who', 'shortage', 'male', 'friends', 'yet', 'meet', 'Mrs', 'Right', 'still', 'home', 'mother', 'who', 'brow', 'beating', 'finding', 'nice', 'girl', 'getting', 'married', 'Marty', 'gotten', 'so', 'tired', 'singles', 'be', 'giving', 'up', 'hope', 'getting', 'married', 'Finally', 'go', 'Stardust', 'ballroom', 'one', 'pals', 'fate', 'changes', 'when', 'plain', 'looking', 'girl', 'named', 'Clara', 'Snyder', 'Betsy', 'Blair', 'up', 'rest', 'film', 'very', 'memorable', 'evening', 'Marty', 'Clara.The', 'movie', 'no-frills', 'production', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'various', 'parts', 'Bronx', 'mid-1950', 'very', 'plain', 'time', 'mostly', 'unheard', 'actors', 'movie', 'radical', 'departure', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'romances', 'where', 'men', 'are', 'strong', 'witty', 'handsome', 'women', 'are', 'beautiful', 'charming', 'are', 'usually', 'impeccably', 'dressed', 'typically', 'members', 'high', 'society', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'enormously', 'effective', 'honest', 'depiction', 'how', 'true', 'romance', 'real', 'life', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'quality', 'was', 'just', 'OK', 'due', 'intermittent', 'tiny', 'specs', 'film', 'deterioration', 'movie', 'few', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'sharp', 'digitally', 'restored', 'look', 'sound', 'fine', 'only', 'bonus', 'trailer', 'hosted', 'Burt', 'Lancaster.Movie', 'ADVD', 'Quality', 'B-']",Marty VHS

It's a plain film about plain people. The story goes beyond the surface of gloss and superficial beauty to the heart beating underneath. Ernest Borgnine gives the finest performance of his career as the lonely butcher, Marty Pilletti. It is one of the most multi-layered performances in the history of film. We see Marty as he appears on the surface, then Mr. Borgnine peels away layer after layer, like an onion, revealing the real Marty deep inside. He calls himself &quot;a fat, ugly man&quot; but he has the most beautiful heart in the world. The supporting cast is first rate, especially Betsy Blair as the plain-jane Clara Snyder. The film explores so many issues, how people can ruin another person's happiness, how ideas and perceptions can change everything in a person's life. I cannot imagine this film being made today.

Running only ninety minutes, the 1955 movie holds the distinction of being the shortest film to win the Best Picture Oscar, and its scale is indeed very small - it covers a weekend in the life of a lonely, overweight Bronx butcher named Marty Piletti. The eldest of six children, the youngest of whom just got married, Marty lives a routine life living with his widowed mother and hanging out with best pal Angie (the source of a classically circular piece of dialogue - ""What do you feel like doing tonight?"" ""I don't know, Ange. What do you feel like doing?"").  Pushed by his mother to go to the Stardust Ballroom where there are a ""lot of tomatoes"", he inadvertently meets Clara, an equally lonely spinster schoolteacher from Brooklyn. It's intriguing to see how cultural mores have changed since both characters are considered over-the-hill for marriage even though he is only 34 and she 29. As they grapple toward intimacy, they face not only their own doubts but those of the people closest to Marty since they become aware how dependent they are on his constant availability.Directed by Delbert Mann in his first time out at the helm, the production seems accurate in capturing the atmosphere of the mid-1950's lower middle class, and the dramatically effective setting allows Marty's story to take on a well-earned poignancy. This has primarily to do with the honest, unsentimental dialogue by Paddy Chavefsky (several years beforeThe HospitalandNetwork). The observant performances complement the treatment with Ernest Borgnine giving his career-best performance in the title role. Even though he is sometimes too robust to be completely convincing as a socially defeated man, he brings surprising force to scenes when his self-awareness no longer can hide his pain. Looking very much like Julie Harris at the time, Betsy Blair has a tougher role as Clara since her character is so withdrawn as to fade when Marty dominates the conversation. Even with her intentionally lank presence, Blair is too attractive to be considered mercilessly as a ""dog"". The rest of the cast takes more predictable turns - Esther Minciotti as Marty's clinging Italian mother, Joe Mantell as codependent Angie, Jerry Paris (a few years before his days as neighbor Jerry Helper onThe Dick Van Dyke Show) and Karen Steele constantly bickering as Marty's cousin and his wife. It's a solidly modest film with no pretensions.

Enest Borgnine (who won a well deserved Oscar for his performance) plays Marty, a butcher living in the Bronx who lives with his mother and has no girlfriend.  He's grown tired of the singles' scene, because he's become a ""professor of pain"", as he puts it, constantly being rejected by women.  He goes reluctantly to a dance hall, where he meets someone who he has a rapport with for once.  This film is a deeply humanistic, caring work, showing Marty in a sympathetic light.  This film probably wouldn't be made today, as a smug, soulless filmmaker would mock Marty and treat him like a loser.  He isn't a loser.  Everyone's been where Marty's been, it's just no one ever freely admits it (especially today).  The film reminds me of Brief Encounter, David Lean's masterpiece, on how modern audiences would howl in laughter at the protagonists in that film, and the ones here.  The films haven't dated, it's just the people have gone into a smug detachment, mocking anyone who dares to be human and caring.  Sure, there are a few dated things (it's shot in NYC in the 1950's, and obviously NYC doesn't look like that today).

Struggling to find confidence due to the ridicule and rejection of people who base on outward appearance, Marty maintains his dignity along with his determination to forge a better path for himself.One night at an upscale nightclub Marty meets a kindred spirit:  Clara, an intelligent, plain girl with dreams of her own.Over many cups of coffee the two share heartfelt conversation and reveal their dreams to one another.  Still, friends and family judge.  In the end, however, true love prevails as Marty firmly resolves to explore a new world of possibility with Clara.An uplifting gem with a timeless message.  The dialogue is superb.  And the simplicity of the story does not detract from its sheer entertainment value as Marty's mother and aunt provide archetypes of Italian culture that add just the right amount of humor to balance the more tender moments!My only disappointment is that the DVD version cuts three to four minutes of footage as Clara spoke with her parents about her date with Marty.  It was such a lovely scene and the movie is not that lengthy to start with.  I hope they repackage this DVD and add those to create a theatrical version.  In fact, it's my dream to see a 4 disc or a last 2-double sided discs that would include the director's cut, the original theatrical version, the 1953 TV version, and a documentary/commentary about the making of the movie.One of the best movies ever filmed!

Based on a brilliant teleplay by Paddy Chayefsky, that aired as an episode of the ""Philco Television Playhouse"" in 1953, MARTY is the type of story in which almost anyone can relate.On the surface, MARTY seems to be merely a sweet little story about a lonely man named Marty Piletti (Ernest Borgnine) who all but has given up on love. However, beyond its sweet exterior, the film reveals how cruel and shallow people can be. An excellent example is an early scene in which Clara (Betsy Blair) appears at a night club. She's fixed up on a blind date with a man that looks like a younger version of Richard Nixon or Bob Dole. What he does to her is vicious.The later scenes involving Marty and Clara ring so true in their simplicity. Although fully clothed and with sexuality tame by modern standards the main characters are emotionally naked. You really feel like you are eavesdropping on real people and not watching a movie.Chayefsky, who also wrote the feature length film, wisely added a series of subplots to add depth and texture to the story. One involves rising tensions between Marty's cousin (Jerry Paris), his wife and his mother that all live under the same roof. Another involves Marty's business aspirations.The result is a multi-layered film that also has a powerful emotional kick. It's hard not to be emotionally moved by this film.

284255,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6301973259,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","A romantic story in New York ten or so years after the war. Italian, what&#8217;s more. The story of sons and daughters-in-law with their respective mothers and mothers-in-law. It is so excessively grotesque that it becomes funny, not hilarious but frankly funny ah, ah, to the point of becoming funny strange.There is not much left to say after that. It is a classic in the form of the film. Black and white but already bigger wider screen, and the film permits good image quality so that it can work on a mass of people and on detail in the set or the costumes. They can also have that poor Marty running and dancing across a street with a wide shot. At the time television, we have the Ed Sullivan Show in one scene, could not have done that due to its low definition.This film is all the more important because it is on such works that Marshall McLuhan built a whole theory about hot and cool media. The cinema is hot because of the high definition, the wide screen and the wide shots, whereas television is cool because of the low definition and the image concentrating on one character if not a close-up shot. The picture of the Ed Sullivan Show is typical: Ed Sullivan filling the whole screen.It is funny to read all that theory built on such a film and the black and white television with an oblong screen. What is most surprising is that McLuhan could not imagine what high definition TV and DVD could be. If you really want to see the difference with today&#8217;s TV you watch the series &#8220;Lost&#8221;: high definition and big screen permit wide pictures, a lot of action and numerous characters with a lot of detail. But Television enables the director to use a lot of flashbacks and flash-forwards that a cinema film could not sustain because a film has to have a rather tight timeline. &#8220;Pulp Fiction&#8221; is one rare film that does not follow a timeline within the plot but cut it up and jumbles the pieces. But it is one film, even one exception. The series &#8220;Lost&#8221; is entirely built on jumping backward and forward at every single moment. Note this is all the more possible because of the pauses in the shooting due to the presence of advertising. When you watch the series on DVD without any advertising you can follow better these time jumps but the result is some kind of flattening of time and then the present is the past and the past is the future and it is all one single simultaneous time that becomes timeless. Then death can be life and life can be death.This film here demonstrates how important it is to have a logical timeline. Strangely enough that makes the film pure entertainment and it somewhat kills any possible reflection, mental work apart from basic questions like &#8220;Is he dumb enough to let the mothers roll over him?&#8221; or &#8220;Is he weak enough to let his men friends trample him over?&#8221; And the film can easily have the punch line it has. That punch line would have been frustrating on TV, definitely not cool at all, whereas in the film it is reassuring about the sanity of men in that mother dominated urban Italian society in those 1950s.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,"So typical of its period, so classic in that way.",1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,3146,"['romantic', 'story', 'New', 'York', 'ten', 'so', 'years', 'war', 'Italian', 'what', '8217', 'more', 'story', 'sons', 'daughters-in-law', 'respective', 'mothers', 'mothers-in-law', 'so', 'excessively', 'grotesque', 'funny', 'not', 'hilarious', 'frankly', 'funny', 'ah', 'ah', 'point', 'becoming', 'funny', 'strange.There', 'not', 'much', 'left', 'say', 'classic', 'form', 'film', 'Black', 'white', 'already', 'bigger', 'wider', 'screen', 'film', 'good', 'image', 'quality', 'can', 'work', 'mass', 'people', 'detail', 'set', 'costumes', 'can', 'also', 'have', 'poor', 'Marty', 'running', 'dancing', 'street', 'wide', 'shot', 'time', 'television', 'have', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Show', 'one', 'scene', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'due', 'low', 'definition.This', 'film', 'more', 'important', 'such', 'works', 'Marshall', 'McLuhan', 'built', 'whole', 'theory', 'hot', 'cool', 'media', 'cinema', 'hot', 'high', 'definition', 'wide', 'screen', 'wide', 'shots', 'whereas', 'television', 'cool', 'low', 'definition', 'image', 'concentrating', 'one', 'character', 'not', 'close-up', 'shot', 'picture', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Show', 'typical', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'filling', 'whole', 'screen.It', 'funny', 'read', 'theory', 'built', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'television', 'oblong', 'screen', 'What', 'most', 'surprising', 'McLuhan', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'what', 'high', 'definition', 'TV', 'DVD', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'difference', 'today', '8217', 's', 'TV', 'watch', 'series', '8220', 'Lost', '8221', 'high', 'definition', 'big', 'screen', 'permit', 'wide', 'pictures', 'lot', 'action', 'numerous', 'characters', 'lot', 'detail', 'Television', 'director', 'use', 'lot', 'flashbacks', 'flash-forwards', 'cinema', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'sustain', 'film', 'have', 'rather', 'tight', 'timeline', '8220', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', '8221', 'one', 'rare', 'film', 'not', 'follow', 'timeline', 'plot', 'cut', 'up', 'pieces', 'one', 'film', 'even', 'one', 'exception', 'series', '8220', 'Lost', '8221', 'entirely', 'built', 'jumping', 'backward', 'forward', 'single', 'moment', 'Note', 'more', 'possible', 'pauses', 'shooting', 'due', 'presence', 'advertising', 'When', 'watch', 'series', 'DVD', 'advertising', 'can', 'follow', 'better', 'time', 'jumps', 'result', 'kind', 'flattening', 'time', 'then', 'present', 'past', 'past', 'future', 'one', 'single', 'simultaneous', 'time', 'timeless', 'Then', 'death', 'can', 'be', 'life', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'death.This', 'film', 'here', 'how', 'important', 'have', 'logical', 'timeline', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'film', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'somewhat', 'possible', 'reflection', 'mental', 'work', 'apart', 'basic', 'questions', '8220', 'dumb', 'enough', 'let', 'mothers', 'roll', '8221', '8220', 'weak', 'enough', 'let', 'men', 'friends', 'trample', '8221', 'film', 'can', 'easily', 'have', 'punch', 'line', 'punch', 'line', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'frustrating', 'TV', 'definitely', 'not', 'cool', 'whereas', 'film', 'reassuring', 'sanity', 'men', 'mother', 'dominated', 'urban', 'Italian', 'society', '1950s.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Marty VHS

284258,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6301973259,JGC,"[9, 10]","""Marty"" is one of those movies that everyone can appreciate because it has such a universal message. Every time I watch this sleeper hit it makes me cry because it's uplifting and a little sentimental. Mr. Ernest Borgnine was amazing as the lonely and self-described lifelong bachelor. It was especially riveting to watch the transformation as Marty shifted from his everyday persona to his passionate and private self. Mr. Borgnine was able to turn on his different moods like a light switch or a faucet because it just happened instantaneously which such a flow.In this movie Mr. Borgnine plays the title role of Marty, a 30 something butcher from Brooklyn. Marty still lives at home like a good Italian-Catholic boy with his widowed mama (Esther Minciotti portrayed his mother, Mrs. Theresa Piletti.) Marty has convinced himself that love is not in the cards so tries to remain complacent in his current situation. To make matters worse all of his brothers and sisters are all married and his mama will stop at nothing to get her son hitched.Mrs. Piletti convinces her son to go out to a dance hall because as she put it, it was packed with ""tomatoes."" While Marty is gone, she goes and visits her sister (Augusta Ciolli plays Aunt Catherine) who is getting pushed out of her married son's and daughter-in-law's home. As Mrs. Piletti tries to convince her sister to come stay with her and leave her married son alone it soon becomes apparent that she may be the next victim to this little game. Like a cat holding onto her 9th life, both ladies will stop at nothing to remain important and feel needed by their children, but each convey a look of desperation and agony.Meanwhile, Marty isn't having much luck. When he builds up the confidence to ask a lady to dance she politely declines. As Marty's standing around he meets a guy who has an offer for him. He'll pay Marty $5.00 (I'm assuming that in 1955 that was a lot of money?) to pretend like they're old friends and escort his girlfriend home because he wants to ditch her! Of course being the gentleman that he is, Marty doesn't play along. Marty surely knew how hurtful this little game would have been and wanted no part of it. Take special notice when Marty says no, the look on Mr. Borgnine's face says it all.But Marty is intrigued and follows the man as he finds another sneak; but his date Clara Snyder (Betsy Blair) says that it isn't necessary because she can find her own way home. As the 2 men quickly disappear (while arguing over who's going to keep the 5 bucks) Marty follows Clara outside. She is crying. Betsy Blair portrayed the hopeless and distraught Clara perfectly. I dunno, to me she was like the female version of Marty. Anyway, it goes without saying that Marty took her in his arms and it was love at first sight.""I'm 29,"" Clara whispered into Marty's ear as they were slow-dancing. She held her breath and had such a look of anticipation (like a woman gets in her 10th month of pregnancy.) But Marty didn't care about her age. Marty brings Clara back to his brownstone and tries to give her a kiss. But she was afraid; Clara didn't know how to let this man into her life because she has never trusted anyone before. ""I just want a kiss,"" hot-tempered Marty says totally frustrated. All of a sudden Marty's mom comes in. Although she is civil to Clara, she's also somewhat icy and cold because she remembers what her sister told her and thinks that once Marty gets married she will be thrown out on the street like yesterdays garbage.The following day, everyone tries to convince Marty that Clara is the wrong girl. When he doesn't call her Clara can be seen waiting next to the telephone with tears in her eyes. Finally, Marty comes to his senses and realizes that it doesn't matter what his mother thinks, it doesn't matter what his friends think and it doesn't matter what anyone else says. He yells to his friend Angie (Joe Mantell,) in perhpaps one of the  most honest revelations and thought-provoking displays of honesty ever depicted on the big screen: All I know is I had a good time last night. I'm gonna have a good time tonight. If we have enough good times together, I'm gonna get down on my knees. I'm gonna beg that girl to marry me. If we make a party on New Year's, I got a date for that party. You don't like her? That's too bad.""Marty"" is a significant film for a myriad of reasons. It's perhaps one of the first pictures of its type that displays the social and personal problems from a guy's perspective. It's also an important movie because it showcases both a ""modern"" or a ""young"" way of thinking (Marty's/Clara's) as well as a very traditional or archaic way of thinking (by Marty's mother & aunt.) I also really enjoy this movie because it has such a positive message; it says that there is someone for everyone and never to give up no matther what anyone might say.Incidentally, Mr. Borgnine is still very much alive. He is actually the oldest Oscar winner and in July, his autobiography,Erniewill be published! I don't watch the Oscars, the Emmys or any of those other shows because it just seems like shameless self promotion. And I am one of those people who think that celebrities and movie stars especially receive way too many awards. But Mr. Ernest Borgnine is a very rare case because in my humble opinion he truly deserves the coveted Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Marty Piletti. No one who could have given a superior depiction of this multifaceted human being than the one and only Mr. Ernest Borgnine.",5,enjoy the sunnyside of life,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,5545,"['Marty',

It is a fine film, exploring the lonliness of plain people who would like to love and be loved.  The motivation, acting, and casting are all superb.  I could find no fault with the film as presented.  The writer understood human nature, and it showed.Betsy Blair, who played Clara, is the only possibly poor job of casting.  She is certainly not a ""plain"" girl, as cast.  She is really quite beautiful, and in fact in real life is Gene Kelly's wife.  Anything but ""plain Jane.""  But they made her as plain as possible, with makeup (or lack of same), and she played the part beautifully.  As far as that goes, Borgnine himself was an attractive man at that age.

He's been looking for a girl every Saturday night of his life and always gets his heart broken. Still, Marty agrees to go to a dance hall when his pal assures him there'll be ""a loada tomatas"" there.I love this movie.  It really is as good as the hype.  It's a national treasure, in that it captured the lives of common folk in 1950s New York and it's very interesting to see how society has changed since then.  What isn't gone is the universal agony of loneliness and Ernest Borgnine portrays this beautifully.

Marty (Ernest Borgnine) has the normal desires of most men (of his day) -- to find a nice young woman and get married.

Borgnine delivers a powerful performance on lessons in non-superficial love.Costar Betsy Blair's name appeared in the ""Red Channels"" during the McCarthy era, effectively ending her acting career in the early 50s.

All your brothers and sisters, younger than you, they get married and got the children.""Ernest Borgnine's Oscar winning performance as the title character in ""Marty"" is so captivating that you might forget the real star of this film is writer Paddy Chayefsky.  Originally ""Marty"" was an acclaimed live television anthology drama that aired in May 1953 on the ""Philco-Goodyear Playhouse.""  The 50-minute production starred Rod Steiger and Nancy Marchand.  The drama was a poignant tale of the battle against loneliness for butcher Marty Piletti, who knew that whatever a woman wanted in a man, ""I ain't got it.""  When Marty finally met a woman, his friends cruelly called her ""a dog.""  But then Marty realized that he was a dog too and seized his chance for happiness, arranging a date as the drama ended.The telecast of ""Marty"" made Chayefsky one of the greatest writers of television's ""Golden Age,"" second only to Rod Serling (""Patterns,"" ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"").  Two years later Chayefsky and director Delbert Mann reunited in Hollywood to make a 90-minute film version of the story, which was expanded masterfully by the author as he explored the pain of being unwanted.  What made the story a winner was that this is not a depressing story and we never fail to feel not only sympathy but affection for the main character.  Marty is about to give up on love when he meets the plain-looking Clair (Betsy Blair), a teacher about to turn 30 who has also faced a life of rejection.  What makes their rejection painful is that they are both decent people, who come together because they are able to recognize their own decent qualities in each other.There are those who complain that the leading players are not ""dogs"" enough to make the story work.  However, Borgnine was never anything close to a traditional leading man.  I certainly think his performance is both convincing and compelling.  The criticism is more telling with regards to Blair, who has a certain attractiveness that goes a bit beyond being ""plain.""  But what is important in the story is not these are ugly people per se, but that their self-esteem and sense of confidence has been completely eroded away by friends and family.  Besides, we would not really expect Hollywood to invest in a film like this with too much authenticity.Most Romantic Lines: These might not be overly romantic, but they are great Chayeksky dialogue: (1) ""All right, so I'll go to the Stardust Ballroom. I'll put on a blue suit, and I'll go. And you know what I'm gonna get for my trouble? Heartache. A big night of heartache""; (2) ""And I also want you to know that I'm having a very good time with you right now and really enjoying myself. You see, you're not such a dog as you think you are""; (3) ""You got a real nice face, you know. Really a nice face""; (4) ""I'd like to see you again - very much. The reason I didn't let you kiss me was because I just didn't know how to handle the situation. You're the kindest man I ever met. The reason I tell you this is because I want to see you again - very much. I know that when you take me home I'm just going to lie on my bed and think about you. I want very much to see you again.""  Of course the most famous exchange in the film is between Marty and his friend: Angie: ""What do you wanna do tonight?""  Marty: ""I dunno, Angie. What do you wanna do?""If you enjoyed this film check out these other films on the American Film Institute's 100 Years 100 Passions list: #14 ""The African Queen,"" #17 ""Moonstruck,"" #23 ""Now, Voyager,"" and #81 ""The Goodbye Girl.""  Why?  Because they all tell love stories in which love comes relatively late in the game for people who believed it was never coming at all.

284271,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6301973259,Lawyeraau,"[76, 80]","Written by the gifted Paddy Chayefsky, this is a memorable film, deftly directed by Delbert Mann. That it has a stage-like, theatrical feel to it is not surprising, considering that it was first a made-for-television play that was later augmented for the silver screen. This element of  theatricality, however, does not detract in the least from this gritty, thematically complex film.Ernest Borgnine plays the role of Marty Piletti, a stocky,  thirty-four year old, lonely Italian butcher living at home in the Bronx with his mother. He is the last of the Piletti brood still in the nest. Physically unattractive and a bit  doltish, he is a socially awkward, lumbering lummox of internal pain and angst. His mother wants him to get married, or so she thinks, until the reality of what such might ultimately mean for her sinks in. She takes her cue from her sister, Marty's Aunt Catherine, who is living with her son and daughter-in-law and making their lives hell. Consequently, she is going to move in with Marty and his mother.Marty  spends most of his spare time with his friend Angie, as well as with a bunch of other losers. Unloved, unmarried, and unable to get a date, Marty has all but given up on finding Miss Right, when he meets a twenty-nine year old  high school teacher, also from the Bronx, Clara Snyder (Betsy Blair), at the famous Stardust Ballroom. Clara, a well educated, nice plain-Jane, is there as part of a pity double date arranged by her brother-in-law. Unfortunately, her date turns out to be a total cad who unceremoniously tries to fob her off on anyone he can, so that he can get some action going with a hot babe he knows. Marty feels Clara's pain, so he asks her to dance, not knowing that he is meeting his feminine counterpart and soul-mate.As the film peels the layers from Marty, the viewer meets the sensitive, kind man who lives within the unattractive exterior. The viewer really gets to feel his pain, as well as that of some of the other characters in the film. One senses the feelings of alienation and loneliness in Clara, as she is dumped by her caddish date. One senses the fear that Mrs. Piletti has at the reality of what Marty's getting married might mean for her. Aunt Catherine's ouster from her son's home, as the older, unwanted woman with few options in life, also makes an impact on the viewer. The angst of Aunt Catherine's son at having to cleave to his wife, rather than to his mother, is also palpable, as is that of Angie at the thought of the possibility of no longer having Marty around to share his own social isolation.The themes in this film, such as loneliness, isolation, alienation, and fear are all themes still relevant today. The only real anachronistic note is struck by the fact that Mrs. Piletti and Aunt Catherine both appear to be in their late sixties or early seventies, but I found to my complete surprise that Aunt Catherine is supposed to be fifty-six, and Mrs. Piletti is her younger sister!  Trust me when I say that, nowadays,  women in their fifties do not look like that.All in all, this is an excellent film. Those who enjoyed this film should also seek out another Paddy Chayefsky film, &quot;The Catered Affair&quot;, starring Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine, which is a bitter sweet film about another Bronx family.",5,THERE IS SOMEONE FOR EVERYONE...,1066003200,"10 13, 2003",2003,3304,"['Written', 'gifted', 'Paddy', 'Chayefsky', 'memorable', 'film', 'deftly', 'directed', 'Delbert', 'Mann', 'stage-like', 'theatrical', 'feel', 'not', 'surprising', 'considering', 'was', 'first', 'made-for-television', 'play', 'was', 'later', 'augmented', 'silver', 'screen', 'element', 'theatricality', 'however', 'not', 'detract', 'least', 'gritty', 'thematically', 'complex', 'film.Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'role', 'Marty', 'Piletti', 'stocky', 'thirty-four', 'year', 'old', 'lonely', 'Italian', 'butcher', 'living', 'home', 'Bronx', 'mother', 'last', 'Piletti', 'brood', 'still', 'nest', 'Physically', 'unattractive', 'bit', 'doltish', 'socially', 'awkward', 'lumbering', 'lummox', 'internal', 'pain', 'angst', 'mother', 'get', 'married', 'so', 'reality', 'what', 'such', 'might', 'ultimately', 'mean', 'sinks', 'cue', 'sister', 'Marty', 'Aunt', 'Catherine', 'who', 'living', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'making', 'lives', 'hell', 'Consequently', 'going', 'move', 'Marty', 'mother.Marty', 'most', 'spare', 'time', 'friend', 'Angie', 'as', 'well', 'bunch', 'other', 'losers', 'Unloved', 'unmarried', 'unable', 'get', 'date', 'Marty', 'given', 'up', 'finding', 'Miss', 'Right', 'when', 'twenty-nine', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'also', 'Bronx', 'Clara', 'Snyder', 'Betsy', 'Blair', 'famous', 'Stardust', 'Ballroom', 'Clara', 'well', 'educated', 'nice', 'plain-Jane', 'there', 'part', 'pity', 'double', 'date', 'arranged', 'brother-in-law', 'Unfortunately', 'date', 'out', 'be', 'total', 'cad', 'who', 'unceremoniously', 'fob', 'off', 'anyone', 'can', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'action', 'going', 'hot', 'babe', 'Marty', 'Clara', 'pain', 'dance', 'not', 'knowing', 'meeting', 'feminine', 'counterpart', 'soul-mate.As', 'film', 'layers', 'Marty', 'viewer', 'sensitive', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'unattractive', 'exterior', 'viewer', 'really', 'feel', 'pain', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'One', 'feelings', 'alienation', 'loneliness', 'Clara', 'dumped', 'caddish', 'date', 'One', 'fear', 'Mrs.', 'Piletti', 'reality', 'what', 'Marty', 'getting', 'married', 'might', 'mean', 'Aunt', 'Catherine', 'ouster', 'son', 'home', 'older', 'unwanted', 'woman', 'few', 'options', 'life', 'also', 'impact', 'viewer', 'angst', 'Aunt', 'Catherine', 'son', 'having', 'cleave', 'wife', 'rather', 'mother', 'also', 'palpable', 'Angie', 'thought', 'possibility', 'longer', 'having', 'Marty', 'share', 'own', 'social', 'isolation.The', 'themes', 'film', 'such', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'alienation', 'fear', 'are', 'themes', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'only', 'real', 'anachronistic', 'note', 'struck', 'fact', 'Mrs.', 'Piletti', 'Aunt', 'Catherine', 'appear', 'be', 'late', 'sixties', 'early', 'seventies', 'found', 'complete', 'surprise', 'Aunt', 'Catherine', 'supposed', 'be', 'fifty-six', 'Mrs.', 'Piletti', 'younger', 'sister', 'Trust', 'when', 'say', 'nowadays', 'women', 'fifties', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'that.All', 'excellent', 'film', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'should', 'also', 'seek', 'out', 'Paddy', 'Chayefsky', 'film', 'quot', 'Catered', 'Affair', 'quot', 'starring', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'film', 'Bronx', 'family']",Marty VHS

Filmed it black and white, it is a character study of an awkward Italian-American Bronx butcher in his thirties who would like get married but has trouble meeting women.  It's a simple story but it is so real that I felt I knew Marty personally. I felt his struggle to make a phone call to ask for a date only to get a brush off.  I saw his annoyance and embarrassment  when his customers all scolded him for not being married.  I sensed his boredom and frustration of another Saturday night hanging out with his buddies in a futile quest for something interesting to do.There's real drama here and it's not just Marty who has problems.  There are his young married cousins who are feeling the frustrations of living in a cramped apartment with their baby and widowed mother.  There is Marty's mother who is afraid of living her own old age alone.  There are his buddies who are as equally bored as Marty.  But most of all, there is the wallflower schoolteacher, played by Betsy Blair, who is just a mite to pretty for the role.  When Marty meets her at a dance where she has just been dumped by a blind date, he finds they have a lot in common and they both enjoy the evening immensely.In spite of the film being made more than 46 years ago, it was still fresh and real.  Paddy Chayefsky was a master with dialog. For example there is the exchange between Marty and his friend Angie.  &quot;Hey Marty, what do you feel like doing tonight?&quot;  &quot;I don't know Angie.  What do you feel like doing?&quot;  These lines get repeated a few times.  And the audience just &quot;gets it&quot;.  Another famous line is when Marty says to the young woman who has just been crying on his shoulder.  &quot;Hey, you're not as much of a dog as you think you are.&quot;This film is about people.  It's about family and love and simple things in life.  The acting was so real that I forgot they were actors.  I loved it and give it one of my highest recommendations.

And strange to say, it is!""Marty"" was a modest movie that made a big splash at the theatres back in the 1950s, and even garnered top honors at the Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Ernest Borgnine. It's about how a thirtysomething butcher is embarrassed at being the last of his brothers and sisters not to be married yet, and his consequent heartbreak over that. We see him get asked over and over by neighborhood ladies, ""Hey, Marty, when are YOU going to get married?"" as if it were something he was doing on purpose. The truth is, Marty is shy and awkward with women, as we witness when he calls a woman he met a few weekends back to get a last-minute date. Although we never see the woman or hear what she has to say, we observe Marty's facial reactions as he undergoes the humiliation of being brushed off. Still smarting under that, he sits down to Saturday dinner with his Italian mamma, only to have her urge him to go out dancing that evening, because otherwise he'll die without a son. This causes a passionate outburst from him, about his own physical deficiencies among other things, winding up, ""So I'll put on the blue suit and I'll go to the dance. And you know what I'm going to get, Ma? Heartache!""It's a very honestly depicted scene, and one that will resonate all too deeply for anyone who has ever felt unlucky not just in love, but in getting any attention they crave from the opposite sex. Marty goes to the dance, and first it looks like he's going to have the same empty night he always has, when he overhears a plain young woman get dumped by her blind date so he can head out with a flashier doll he knew from before. Marty's compassionate nature prompts him to approach the plain woman, Clara, and thus he embarks on a night-long soul search where he and Clara share their private hopes and dreams (as well as past disappointments) together over coffee and just walking around the neighborhood. It's very well done and the audience can't help but feel for the two people tentatively putting their emotions on the line, hoping for acceptance at last.An important point the film also raises is that neither Marty nor Clara are in complete isolation. We don't see her world tonight, but we do see Marty's community. He has his well-meaning mother who now begins to fear losing her last stay-at-home child; his loser friends who are always looking for action but not a real relationship; and his cousin and his wife, who are having to deal with a real mother-in-law problem. That bitter old aunt influences Marty's mother, and puts ideas in her head about how she too will one day find herself lonely and left out if Marty should ever find a girl to marry. All these people impact upon Marty and the decisions he makes about what to do the day after his date with Clara, and we see how tragic it can be if sometimes people let themselves be pressured by other folks' expectations and opinions.I hadn't seen ""Marty"" in many years before viewing it again, and I can say it really hits home today. If you have never seen this little picture that has so much heart, I can't recommend it highly enough.

Nevertheless, this motion picture is a great example of how little the human condition has changed.  Marty is simply a man who doesn't want to spend the rest of his life alone.  His family teases him, and even pressures, about finding someone.  However, his problems don't end when he finally does find a girl he likes(and the feeling is mutual).If anything this film is MORE revelant now, becuase it is harder to find other singles who are seeking a serious, marital relationship than it was in 1954 (or so I am told).Marty is a great dramatic film, the special effects are superb acting and writing.

284283,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6301973259,Martin Asiner,"[15, 15]","When director Delbert Mann recreated the television version of Paddy Chayefsky's MARTY, he could not have guessed that he was also creating a masterpiece that spoke volumes about the self-imposed walls of loneliness that dispirited people erect around themselves.  Ernest Borgnine has never been more believable than the 35 year old pudgy butcher who has been hurt so often by uncaring women that he has despaired of ever finding a wife.  Marty is a caring, decent, if not attractive Italian man still living at home with his mother.  Although the film starts out as Marty's cry of pain, it soon becomes apparent that he is not alone in his solitude.  His mother is a widow who fears losing her son to another women.  His aunt lives with her unwilling son and his wife and fears that if she does not boss them around, they will not pay attention to her.  They, in turn, need their privacy but fear telling the aunt so.  Marty's best friend, Angie, is a loser who wants only to make sure that he does not suffer alone.  Marty meets Clara, a twenty-nine year old plain jane who has suffered plenty herself at the hands of superficial men.  Each of them seems locked into a lifestyle that consists mainly of endless repetitions of ""What are you doing tonight?""  But this tiresome circle is broken at a neighborhood dance where several lives unexpectedly open and blossom.  Clara is brought to the dance by a cad who promptly dumps her for another woman.  Marty notices her distress and talks to her, first at the dance, then for hours at a soda shop.  They talk, and talk some more, and discover that in Marty's words, ""Maybe we are not the dogs that people call us.""  As they bond, Angie sees that he is losing his buddy sufferer and tries to break them up.  Marty's mother sees the bonding and she tries to break them up as well. Marty discovers that solitude is a self-imposed blanket that can be discarded at will.MARTY is a superbly entertaining movie that is not as simple as one might think, given the focused intent on the breaking of these bonds.  What Ernest Borgnine as Marty and Betsy Blair as Clara prove is that if people can isolate themselves from others, then they will stay isolated until they decide that enough is enough.  Marty and Clara learn this.  Angie does not. We in the audience certainly do.",5,MARTY: Ma! I'm Ugly!

It is the first and only time a movie based upon a popular television show has won Best Picture. It stars Ernest Borgnine as the title character, a lonely and shy butcher who finds unlikely romance with wallflower, Betsy Blair (Clara Snyder). The film examines their quiet and unassuming relationship as that of two outcasts in a society where everyone has someone to love except them. Esther Minciotti costars as Marty's mother. Her concern over her son's bachelorhood is quite comical, referring to girls as ""tomatoes"" and suggesting that her son ""pluck one"" that is ripe for the picking at a local dance.  Joe Mantell and Jerry Paris costar as Marty's well meaning friends, who inadvertently confuse Marty into dropping Betsy because she isn't attractive enough.MGM/UA has presented ""Marty"" in a very nice looking full frame transfer. The B&amp;W picture exhibits a relatively solid and stable gray scale that is nicely balanced. Contrast and shadow levels are adequate. Film grain is a bit heavy at times but does not distract. There is a lack of digital anomalies, except for a hint of edge enhancement that crops up now and then.  The audio is mono but exceptionally well balanced.

284291,A31QEAZMJWBF28,6301973259,NMdesapio,"[4, 4]","The golden age of television drama - plays written to be produced on TV - in the U.S. was the 1950's and early 1960's.  During this era, three dramatists dominated the airwaves.  They were Rod Serling (PATTERNS, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, THE COMEDIAN), Reginald Rose (TWELVE ANGRY MEN), and Paddy Chayefsky, who wrote MARTY.  This gem of a play was produced on TV in 1953 with Rod Steiger in the title role.  In 1955 it was made into a movie starring Ernest Borgnine; this is the version under consideration here.A charming, touching ninety-minute character study, MARTY is about Marty Pilletti, a shy, heavyset bachelor who works as a butcher.  This thirty-four year old man comes from a large Italian-American family in which it is a shame to be single.  All of Marty's younger siblings are married, and the question on the lips of everyone - his mother, the neighbors - is, `Marty, when are YOU gonna get married?'  Marty wants to make up his own mind, yet he is too kind a man to tell the others to let him alone.  Then he meets Clara Snyder, a nice but plain girl, at a dance hall one night.  Though they like each other instantly, Marty's bachelor friends protest his choice, while his mother begins to feel that if her son marries and moves out of her house, she will be lonely.  In the end, Marty himself must choose between loneliness and love.From the start, this MARTY has a stage-like quality; Chayefsky's dialogue bubbles along, and every word of it is genuine.  Borgnine's portrayal of Marty is so tenderly emotional, so real...in short, he IS Marty.  Betsy Blair matches him perfectly as Clara.  Joe Mantell - who was nominated for an Oscar for his performance as Marty's friend Angie - speaks the script's famous, emblematic line, ""So, whatta ya feel like doin' tonight, Marty?""

He also did the screenplay.The story is about two people who manage to meet and fall in love after each has sufferred through years of feeling rejected by the opposite sex. The movie is set mostly in an Italian neighborhood in the Bronx. It is a relatively short film but it packs a powerful message.Ernest Borgnine is superb as the clumsy bachelor who appears stuck in a hopeless situation with no prospects of finding a suitable wife. Betsy Blair gives an unforgettable performance as the almost thirtyish school teacher who seems totally defeated by her failures to attract a boy friend. Joe Martell is very credible in the role of Marty's buddy Angie.The movie walked off with several Academy Awards in 1955 receiving Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Delbert Mann), Best Actor (Ernest Borgnine) and Best Screenplay.

It's a shame they don't make em' like this anymore.Marty Piletti is a 34-year-old Bronx Butcher who lives with his mother. He's a sweet natured guy with a good heart, stocky build and not so perfect looks. He's feeling pressure from customers, friends and family to get married. All of his brothers and sisters are married and they want him to get married. Unfortunately poor Marty has met up with so much rejection and humiliation he's become resigned to never finding that special someone. But at the goading (nagging) of his mother he and a friend Angie, head down to the Stardust Ballroom on Saturday night. There Marty meets Clara, a plain Jane 29-year-old science teacher who has been unceremoniously dumped by her date. Marty comforts Clara and asks her to dance. As, they walk around the neighborhood discussing their hopes and dreams we learn how beautiful these two people are on the inside. Over the course of a night this man who seemed so hopeless starts to see the light at the end of the tunnel.Sunday morning, Marty is buzzing over the chance for romance. As he starts to see opportunity for growth in his relationship with Clara, his family and friends insecurities grow over the changes in their own lives. This is the brilliant plot twist in Chayefsky's screenplay- everyone wants Marty to marry-so he can be just as miserable as they are! Marty is under pressure to not call or see Clara again, and spends a whole day debating his options. While spending another Sunday night with the fellas, he realizes that misery loves company and he has an opportunity at something better. The movie ends when he wakes up and makes the call to Clara and takes his own happiness into his own hands.This is a great film; it deserved every Oscar it got and more, it's one of the best pictures the American Cinema has ever produced. Period. Within Chayefsky's simple character study of a South Bronx Butcher is a deep multileveled examination of love and the human condition. On the surface it looks like Marty's family and friends are interested in his happiness by pressuring him to get married. But the irony is that they want him to conform and be like them- Miserable and dissatisfied with their own lives. They secretly want to take away Marty's happiness! Clara the educated woman represents independence and self-control, things Marty desires in his own life. While Marty represents courage, drive and character to Clara, something she desires in her own life. Both inspire each other to make the changes in their lives to find happiness and self-actualization. I love this movie!Production values are amazing on this movie. Filming on location works to great advantage for Director Delbert Mann. As a lifelong resident of the South Bronx, it was a delight to take a trip through time and see places I go to shop and hang out on the weekends like Webster Avenue and Fordham Road looked like over 50 years ago. Now I know what older people talk about when they say the Bronx was beautiful back in the day. The lights on the streets reminded me of Times Square.Paddy Chayefsky's Oscar Winning screenplay is a work of art. Plain and simple it is brilliant. Every line has a purpose; every action has a reason for being there. The dialogue feels real, the storyline tighter than a drum It is the work of a master of his craft at the height of his prime.The acting here is some of the best I have ever seen. Ernest Borgnine is powerful as Marty. He brings warmth, humanity and love and compassion to the character. You see every part of this man's inner torment and his daily struggles onscreen. He deserved his Oscar for best actor. Betsy is beautiful as the dowdy schoolteacher Clara. She has great chemistry with Borgnine and brings out the inner beauty of her homely character.

284307,A4JHEO7H330AF,6301973259,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","MARTY, starring Ernest Borgnine, concerns a turning point in the life of a thirty something gentleman.  The fact-pattern in MARTY is representative of certain challenges, or situations, that confront thousands, or perhaps millions, of American men.  Hence, this film could be viewed as being a documentary of one a typical life pathway for American men.  In fact, a reasonable alternate title for this movie would be, ""A Week in the Life of Mister Generic Everyman.""  Perhaps, because this films restrains from any attempt to be comedic, refrains from attempts to be unusual, refrains from including any characters with a debilitation or with an unusual talent or skill, and refrains from any sense of adventure or mystery, the film manages to avoid making any false steps.  Does this make a great movie?  In other words, if the scriptwriter and director manage to assemble a cinematic work that refrains from making any false steps during the course of 90 minutes, does this along cause the movie to be a great movie?  I don't know, perhaps, perhaps not.The particular life pathway that is documented by MARTY is for an American man with the following qualities:(1) Has career ambitions but, for the moment, is still operating at entry level;(2) Has ambitions to be a ""conventional"" family man but, while approaching his mid thirties, has yet to meet a woman who will accept him;(3) Occupies a transition point where his parents (in this movie, his mother) considers ethnic background to be important, but where the protagonist (Mr. Borgnine) does not consider ethnic background to be relevant in a potential marriage partner;(4) Has friends and acquaintances who are, for the most part, unskilled, unmotivated, and who occupy the gutter of society;(5) Has relatives who are drama queens (argumentative);(6) Is not physically attractive but, more importantly, dwells occasionally on the fact that he is not physically attractive.Thus, the above list represents certain qualities that pertain to a chunk of the American populace. The movie is more like a case history in a psychology textbook, or in a sociology textbook, than a typical drama. There is little or nothing in this movie to make it stand out from the millions of lives that are played out by men in their mid-thirties, in the United States of America.  But what makes this film a successful one, is that the sterotypical story is skillfully presented.MARTY concerns a 35 year old butcher (Mr. Borgnine) who is not adept with women. But he has the admirable quality of never giving up, and eventually, at the town dance hall, he eventually meets the woman of his life.  The woman happens to be a high school chemistry teacher, trained at New York Univesity . . . but her hangup is that she has no personality.  (This was obviously the intention of the scriptwriter and the director -- that the woman should be devoid of any personality.)  And so, the spark of love is ignited by the fact that Mr. Borgnine has had no luck in his quest for a domestic, married life (because of his lack of social skills), and by the fact that the woman has had no luck, apparently for the same reasons.  The two share this quality.  They also share the quality of being decent, and not frivolous.  Also, they share the quality of being Catholic.Mr. Borgnine's goal of obtaining domestic bliss is occasionally threatened.  His mother complains about the chemistry teacher, because of the fact that she is not Italian.  Also, Mr. Borgnine almost blows it by insisting that the woman kiss him on his first date.  Also, during the course of his first date, Mr. Borgnine's date is interrupted by his friends (in an automobile) who invite him to spend and evening with a slut in the back seat.  Also, Mr. Borgnine, in the course of his first date, is in danger of blowing it because of his behavior in conducting the date as a monologue (basically, his modus operandi in conducting the date is to narrate his own biography).  Another stress point, is that Mr. Borgnine's friends refer to the woman (the first date) as a ""dog,"" meaning that she is ugly.  Despite these potential roadblocks, Mr. Borgnine is not derailed from his goals, and he remains admirably focuesed on his goal of winning the reward of domestic bliss.  Although the film does not conclude with any marriage ceremony, it is apparent by the end of the film, that Mr. Borgnine has captured the heart of the chemistry teacher.BETSY BLAIR.  Actress and dancer Betsy Blair provides the love interest.  In MARTY, she is reticent in speaking, and is a decided introvert.  But these work to Mr. Borgnine's advantage, because he has the same qualities which, in a similarly encumbered counterpart, can ignite the chemistry of love.  At any rate, it is interesting to know that Betsy Blair was married (in real life) to none other than Gene Kelly, one of the most beloved and adored actors in the history of Hollywood.  Another interesting fact, is that Betsy Blair almost got turned down for the part because she was being investigated by HUAC for alleged sympathy with the Communist party.CONCLUSION.  MARTY does not have any particular plot.  It is the case, instead, that MARTY documents one of a dozen or so typical life pathways of a mid-thirties man, in his quest for domestic bliss.  In this case, Mr. Borgnine's quest is to find a wife, and also, to rise above his role of being an ordinary butcher, and to own his own butcher shop.  The movie provides a skillful account of the ""drama queen"" personality.  In this movie, there are three drama queens: Husband, husband's mother, and wife.  The three of them are exceptionally skilled at getting into arguments with each other.  Similar ""drama queen"" type bickering can be found in ABOUT SCHMIDT, with Jack Nicholson, and in the film, AMADEUS.  A continual theme in MARTY, which adds charm to the movie, are the Italianisms, which take the form of broken English, pride for Italian things (Mr. Borgnine expressed pride in Italian meat for his butcher shop), and Sunday mass.The film is also to be commended for its total absence of violence, absence of guns, absence of bad language, and absence of computer graphics. An excellent counterpoint to MARTY is the film, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, starring Anthony Quinn.  This movie also concerns a man who occupies a challenging transition point in his career,and who also has had bad luck with women.  But in REQUIEM, it is the case that Anthony Quinn is at the verge of success with finding a mate, but his blows it, and he loses the woman.  Thus, I think it might be a good idea to watch MARTY and also REQUIEM at the same sitting.  Unlike MARTY, REQUIEM is a very unusual movie, with intriguingly unique characters, for example, a female gangster named, ""Ma Greenie.""

284308,A96K1ZGW56S2I,6301973259,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[9, 9]","Everyone in the world is looking for love. Children seek love from the parents and friends. High school girls desire a boy to love them. Husband and wives long to love each other. Sometimes this desire is met. Many times it is not. The movies are filled with this universal search.  But very often it is sloppily done.Not so in MARTY. MARTY is one of the most rare films ever to come out of Hollywood. It was made in a period in which the studios seemed to churn out one great picture after another. Even the most uninteresting films of the era were more inspired than the majority of garbage shoveled out of the studios nowadays. But even in that Golden Era, MARTY was different.The movie revolves around Marty Piletti (Ernest Borgnine). Marty is a 30-something butcher who has virtually given up trying to find the right woman.  After years of going to clubs and dance halls seeking to find a woman that he can get along with, he now spends most of his weekends sitting at his friends' homes watching tv. Marty lives owns his own butcher shop and being the dutiful son and lives with his mother (in a culture where it would seem children and parents mutually abandon each other, this might be the most non-understable concept for many). After a disagreement with said parent, Marty goes to a famous dance club to appease her.  While there, Marty meets a young teacher named Clara Snyder (Betsy Blair). Marty and Clara strike it off right away and as the night begins to turn into day, the couple wander from one part of the city to another. It would seem that both Clara and Marty had finally found the love they were looking for.  But, years of self-doubt and bad advice from friends sets in. The question they have struggled with for years comes back is raised again, ""Can someone as unattractive as me really be loved?"" The answer lies in the movies conclusion.MARTY is a very heartwarming, honest, sincere romantic movie. It was made 50 years ago, yet it still resonates with audiences still today. The film is very true; very human. It touches at the core of our soul and stirs are hearts. It is a truly moving movie, yet one that isn't sentimental or sappy.Ernest Borgnine won a Best Actor Oscar and his performance is well deserved. Very seldom has an everyman been captured so well on film. The movie could have been Betsy Blair's comeback film, but even after such a performance, Hollywood refused to erase her from the blacklist and though she received a Best Actress nomination, she would be living in Europe just three years later--outcasted from American show business. The movie was written by Paddy Chayefsky and was based off a teleplay that had earlier aired on television. Chayefsky's writing is pure genius and is the essence of what makes the film work.Besides winning the 1956 Academy Award for Best Picture and just being a great, moving movie, MARTY is also signifcant for several other reasons. It is the only movie to have won both the Best Picture Oscar and the Cannes Palme d'Or.

No one wants either of them until they are drawn together by fate and end up talking for hours one evening after leaving the dance.He's Italian and she's not. She's educated and he isn't, but they find a common thread in the fact they are both lonely and looking for companionship.

Marty is a film that, for its time, was something a little bit of a marvel considering the many films that dealt with men and women being happily married or men being shown to be overtly misogynistic or careless.Thankfully, Borgnine portrays himself with good heart and a sense of curiosity in this film that even young men who have not had much experience with dating and relationships can say. I could relate a lot to the character's emotional periods and sense of humour. It is what, in many ways, some men are portrayed as in real life and the film does a good job at that with a nice simple story, subtle sense of realism (especially with its ambiguous ending showing Marty being independent and taking initiative even without his mother's word), and showing parental, romantic, and fraternal relationships at work in a way where it is not too corny, inaccurate, or far-fetched like some 1950s films show at times.While there is not a whole lot to say given its rather simple nature, Marty, from a person who has only seen an infrequent amount of ""classic"" films (anything before 1980), was a well-done effort and I hope more people within the interest of film and television catch this little gem.""",5,"A joyous, simple, and relatable film from start to finish!",1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,1348,"['Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'stars', 'most', 'praised', 'performance', 'beaten-down', 'New', 'York', 'butcher', 'who', 'mother', 'word', 'find', 'nice', 'woman', 'Marty', 'film', 'time', 'was', 'something', 'little', 'bit', 'marvel', 'considering', 'many', 'films', 'dealt', 'men', 'women', 'being', 'happily', 'married', 'men', 'being', 'shown', 'be', 'overtly', 'misogynistic', 'careless.Thankfully', 'Borgnine', 'good', 'heart', 'sense', 'curiosity', 'film', 'even', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'much', 'experience', 'dating', 'relationships', 'can', 'say', 'could', 'relate', 'lot', 'character', 'emotional', 'periods', 'sense', 'humour', 'what', 'many', 'ways', 'men', 'are', 'portrayed', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'nice', 'simple', 'story', 'subtle', 'sense', 'realism', 'especially', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'showing', 'Marty', 'being', 'independent', 'taking', 'initiative', 'even', 'mother', 'word', 'showing', 'parental', 'romantic', 'fraternal', 'relationships', 'work', 'way', 'where', 'not', 'too', 'corny', 'inaccurate', 'far-fetched', '1950s', 'films', 'show', 'times.While', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'say', 'given', 'rather', 'simple', 'nature', 'Marty', 'person', 'who', 'only', 'seen', 'infrequent', 'amount', 'classic', 'films', 'anything', '1980', 'was', 'well-done', 'effort', 'hope', 'more', 'people', 'interest', 'film', 'television', 'catch', 'little', 'gem']",Marty VHS

Adams,"[8, 8]","""Marty"" came out when I was ten, and still too young to think about dating, but this tale of how unattractive but decent people hooked up in '50's big city America still resonates with those of us who are not photogenic, slim, or sexy. Everything about this film is dated except for the fears of rejection and the hopes for love that the main characters display in every word, movement, or silence. This is a world in which to ""date"" did not mean to sleep with, and in which being Italian or Polish or Catholic or Protestant was one of the most important things about a person. It was also a world in which the opinions of one's parents and grandparents and extended family were powerful when it comes to choosing a life partner. Dating has certainly changed in the past half-century, but shyness and insecurity are still with many of us. People under the age of 50 may find ""Marty"" boring, but if they want to know how different ""finding a mate"" was for their grandparents' generation, this film will show them that, along with some powerful acting and crisp screenwriting.",4,"Still has its quiet power, after 50 years...",1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,1074,"['Marty', 'came', 'when', 'was', 'ten', 'still', 'too', 'young', 'think', 'dating', 'tale', 'how', 'unattractive', 'decent', 'people', 'hooked', 'up', ""'50"", 'big', 'city', 'America', 'still', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'photogenic', 'slim', 'sexy', 'Everything', 'film', 'dated', 'fears', 'rejection', 'hopes', 'love', 'main', 'characters', 'display', 'word', 'movement', 'silence', 'world', 'date', 'did', 'not', 'mean', 'sleep', 'being', 'Italian', 'Polish', 'Catholic', 'Protestant', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'things', 'person', 'was', 'also', 'world', 'opinions', 'one', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'extended', 'family', 'were', 'powerful', 'when', 'choosing', 'life', 'partner', 'Dating', 'certainly', 'changed', 'past', 'half-century', 'shyness', 'insecurity', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'People', 'age', '50', 'may', 'find', 'Marty', 'boring', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'different', 'finding', 'mate', 'was', 'grandparents', 'generation', 'film', 'will', 'show', 'powerful', 'acting', 'crisp', 'screenwriting']",Marty VHS
