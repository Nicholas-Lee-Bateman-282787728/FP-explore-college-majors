Season 4 has some great episodes, I just loved everything about this show. My favorite episodes from season 4 include: Crimes and Michelle's Demeanor, Slumber Party, Shape Up, One Last Kiss, and Secret Admirer. Every season is worth purchasing especially this particular season. Bob Saget was accused of not being naturally funny but I think he's quite clever.

993966,AHNNSD2R9AL3P,B000FQIRWC,Aly-oops!,"[3, 5]","I used to watch this show when it was originally on the air. Now my step-daughter (13) absolutely loves the series. Neither my husband nor myself can stand to sit through an episode, as the writing & acting are (not surprisingly) far more sub-par than I remembered. However, the girl loves 'em & always asks for the season boxed sets as gifts. Since we don't typically watch TV, getting to watch a few episodes of ""her show"" is a great treat.The show's premise is simple. Dad, Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) is left widowed with three daughters, D.J. (Candace Cameron), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), & Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olson). Brother-in-law, Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), & best friend, Joey (Dave Coulier), move in to help Danny raise the girls. However, the three men barely stand a chance against the young girls' innocent faces, cute quips, & girlish charm.The show is fairly innocent & clean, safe for almost all ages. There really isn't much objectionable here, unless you want to avoid cheesy writing & acting. Sisterly love & the importance of family are strong themes here, which is always a plus. This show is definitely preferred to much of today's TV-fare, in my opinion.",5,Great for Pre-Teens & Young Teens,1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,1184,"['used', 'watch', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'air', 'Now', 'step-daughter', '13', 'absolutely', 'series', 'husband', 'can', 'stand', 'sit', 'episode', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'far', 'more', 'sub-par', 'remembered', 'However', 'girl', ""'em"", 'always', 'season', 'boxed', 'sets', 'gifts', 'do', ""n't"", 'typically', 'watch', 'TV', 'getting', 'watch', 'few', 'episodes', 'show', 'great', 'treat.The', 'show', 'premise', 'simple', 'Dad', 'Danny', 'Tanner', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'left', 'widowed', 'three', 'daughters', 'D.J', 'Candace', 'Cameron', 'Stephanie', 'Jodie', 'Sweetin', 'Michelle', 'Mary', 'Kate', 'Ashley', 'Olson', 'Brother-in-law', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'John', 'Stamos', 'best', 'friend', 'Joey', 'Dave', 'Coulier', 'move', 'help', 'Danny', 'raise', 'girls', 'However', 'three', 'men', 'barely', 'stand', 'chance', 'young', 'girls', 'innocent', 'cute', 'quips', 'girlish', 'charm.The', 'show', 'fairly', 'innocent', 'clean', 'safe', 'almost', 'ages', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'objectionable', 'here', 'want', 'avoid', 'cheesy', 'writing', 'acting', 'Sisterly', 'love', 'importance', 'family', 'are', 'strong', 'themes', 'here', 'always', 'plus', 'show', 'definitely', 'preferred', 'much', 'today', 'TV-fare', 'opinion']",Full House: Season 4

One thing I have a problem with watching this set is the poor transfer quailty of some of the episodes.  The picture is nowhere near sharp, and looks like watching an old television with an antenna, where the outline of people is double.  It's even worse the VHS quality, because at least that is sharp.  Some episodes are worse than others, such as the one where Joey does the show with Frankie Avalon, which is horrible.  This episode just aired on ABC Family this week, and it was crystal clear, so I am not sure what happened with the DVD transfers.  And then the very next show after that one is fine, so it's not consistent.  The packaging seems to get smaller each season, so maybe they cut costs on offering a high quality transfer as well.  However, season 5 does not seem to have this problem.It's a good season, as the kids are a little older, and all actor's have settled into their roles well.  I think seasons 3 and 4 are the best of the series.  Kid's will probably not notice the difference in picture quality on this 4th season, but it certainly annoyed me.",3,"Good season, but what happened to the picture quality?",1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,1190,"['daughter', 'season', 'Michelle', 'spewing', 'out', 'funny', 'comments', 'talking', 'more', 'other', '3', 'One', 'thing', 'have', 'problem', 'watching', 'set', 'poor', 'transfer', 'quailty', 'episodes', 'picture', 'nowhere', 'near', 'sharp', 'watching', 'old', 'television', 'antenna', 'where', 'outline', 'people', 'double', 'even', 'worse', 'VHS', 'quality', 'least', 'sharp', 'episodes', 'are', 'worse', 'others', 'such', 'one', 'where', 'Joey', 'show', 'Frankie', 'Avalon', 'horrible', 'episode', 'just', 'aired', 'ABC', 'Family', 'week', 'was', 'crystal', 'clear', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'happened', 'DVD', 'transfers', 'then', 'very', 'next', 'show', 'one', 'fine', 'not', 'consistent', 'packaging', 'get', 'smaller', 'season', 'so', 'maybe', 'cut', 'costs', 'offering', 'high', 'quality', 'transfer', 'well', 'However', 'season', '5', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'problem.It', 'good', 'season', 'kids', 'are', 'little', 'older', 'actor', 'have', 'settled', 'roles', 'well', 'think', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'are', 'best', 'series', 'Kid', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'notice', 'difference', 'picture', 'quality', '4th', 'season', 'certainly', 'annoyed']",Full House: Season 4
993975,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000FQIRWC,Dorrie Wheeler,"[17, 18]","Full House is one of the most loved family sitcoms in modern history.  The show was a hit on ABC since its 1987 debut.  The show can be found airing in syndication somewhere in the world every day.  The shows 4th season is one of the most memorable ones.  This is the season in which Uncle Jessie and Becky get married.Full House-The Complete Fourth Season includes 20 episodes from the shows fourth season.  The shows fourth season aired on ABC during the 1990-1991 season.  The season opens up with the episode ""Greek Week.""  Jessie's Greek family come's to town and they bring some interesting guys.  Ashley and Mary Kate Olson share rare screen time together in this episode as one of the twins plays a distant cousin who looks just like Michelle.  They also bring to town a teenage boy named Silvio that DJ has a crush on and a voluptuous woman who plans to rekindle her relationship with Jessie--much to Becky's dismay.  The episode concludes with awesome news--Becky and Jessie get engaged-again.The fourth season of Full House is easily as enjoyable as previous seasons.  The two part episode ""The Wedding"" is classic. Whereas season 3 seemed much more driven by the storylines of the kids, season 4 saw the adult storylines expanding.  Besides Becky and Jessie's relationship intensifying, the three men decide to go into business together.  Joey has to come to terms with his father after his father comes to see him perform in Las Vegas, and Jesse attends his high school reunion.The kids have their fair share of storylines also.  Michelle has to deal with a school bully, DJ deals with the pressure to be thin, and Stefanie frets about having to wear glasses.The fourth season is pivotal to the show and if you are a collector of the series on DVD you can't miss out on Full House the Complete Fourth Season.

I love it still and it brings back memories of school vacation watching these same episodes over and over again.This is one of the better seasons.  It starts with Greek Week where some of Jesse's family comes over from Greece with some surprises (also the episode where he proposes to Becky) and ends with Rock The Cradle in which Becky finds out that she's pregnant just as Jesse finds out he's going out on the road for a tour.  The absolute standout episode and in my opinion is the best episode in the entire 8 seasons, is Secret Admirer.  Danny is dating a girl with a son called Rusty who is a trouble maker.  He writes a love letter and one thing leads to another and havoc ensues.  Hillarious.While this doesn't seem as funny anymore after the likes of the humour that came from Friends or Two And A Half Men, it's an innocent (if not sometimes corny) humour that is perfectly fit for all ages and especially kids.

993983,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000FQIRWC,Mark Baker,"[3, 5]","The Tanner Family is back to make us laugh with season four of Full House.The big news this season is a wedding.  Becky (Lori Loughlin) and Jesse (John Stamos) tie the knot.  We go from the proposal to the ceremony this season with such stops along the way as buying the ring (and Jesse selling his Elvis guitar to pay for it), picking a location (Graceland or Kansas), and Jesse picking a best man.But the wedding isn't the only storyline.  There's still plenty for the rest of the gang.  Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) discovers that there can be consequences when she misbehaves.  Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) is tempted to throw a baseball game for a really cute boy.  D.J. (Candace Cameron) becomes editor of the school newspaper and finds that hiring your best friend (Andrea Barber's Kimmy) can lead to problems if she doesn't do the work.  Danny (Bob Saget) dates a dry cleaner with a prankster of a son and a much younger woman.  And Joey (Dave Coulier) reunites with his dad and gets a chance at TV stardom along side Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello.This season has a couple of other standout episodes.  ""Slumber Party"" finds Stephanie trying to decide what to do about the mother-daughter sleepover her Honeybee hive is having.  This episode truly tugs at the heartstrings.  Also in that category is ""Fuller House.""  The episode right after Becky and Jesse's wedding, everyone struggles with the idea of Jesse moving out of the house, especially Jesse and Michelle.

Also noteworthy this season, the season premier features one of the few times that Mary-Kate and Ashley appear on screen together.As always, the cast is great and the shows are funny.

993984,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000FQIRWC,MollyRK,"[14, 16]","The classic 1980's-1990's sitcom ""Full House"" showed gradual improvement from Season 1 to Season 2, as well as from Season 2 to Season 3, but I believe that this 4th season is where the series was truly launched as the fun, lighthearted, and wholesome show that it was. A lot of changes took place, but that same formula of family love and closeness remained to give ""Full House"" the footing it needed to remain successful.Season 4 was filled with many happy times and humorous occasions, beginning with the hilarious series opener ""Greek Week,"" progressing with Joey's Las Vegas gig to open up for Wayne Newton, and of course, continuing with the long-awaited 1-hour episode that chronicled the beautiful wedding of Jesse and Becky (but as Michelle would say, ""everything went bananas"" on that day!) There were also many sweet and often dramatic moments sprinkled throughout the season, mainly with the three Tanner kids. Now ages 4, 9, and 14 (approximately), the girls are all growing up and contributing more emotion to the storylines. Teenager DJ struggles with peer pressure and experiments with a crash diet to shape up for an upcoming pool party, and a mother/daughter sleepover shows Stephanie the pangs of not having a mom in her life. Even little pre-schooler Michelle learns a tough lesson in family separation after her beloved Uncle Jesse gets married and considers moving out for good. The three of them were always very cute, and now that they are getting older, the material given to them is becoming stronger and fitting to their talent.The impressively quick-paced release of these ""Full House"" DVD's has been very enjoyable for long-time fans of the series (the first half of the series has already been released!), and with the obvious success that the DVD transfer has had, I am sure we can look forward to seeing Seasons 5-8 in the near future!",5,Full House truly takes off with a strong and credible 4th season!,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,1867,"['classic', ""1980's-1990"", 'sitcom', 'Full', 'House', 'showed', 'gradual', 'improvement', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '2', 'as', 'well', 'Season', '2', 'Season', '3', 'believe', '4th', 'season', 'where', 'series', 'was', 'truly', 'launched', 'fun', 'lighthearted', 'wholesome', 'show', 'was', 'lot', 'changes', 'took', 'place', 'same', 'formula', 'family', 'love', 'closeness', 'remained', 'give', 'Full', 'House', 'footing', 'needed', 'remain', 'successful.Season', '4', 'was', 'filled', 'many', 'happy', 'times', 'humorous', 'occasions', 'beginning', 'hilarious', 'series', 'Greek', 'Week', 'progressing', 'Joey', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'gig', 'open', 'up', 'Wayne', 'Newton', 'course', 'continuing', 'long-awaited', '1-hour', 'episode', 'chronicled', 'beautiful', 'wedding', 'Jesse', 'Becky', 'Michelle', 'would', 'say', 'everything', 'went', 'bananas', 'day', 'were', 'also', 'many', 'sweet', 'often', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'sprinkled', 'season', 'mainly', 'three', 'Tanner', 'kids', 'Now', '4', '9', '14', 'approximately', 'girls', 'are', 'growing', 'up', 'contributing', 'more', 'emotion', 'storylines', 'Teenager', 'DJ', 'peer', 'pressure', 'experiments', 'crash', 'diet', 'shape', 'up', 'upcoming', 'pool', 'party', 'mother/daughter', 'sleepover', 'Stephanie', 'pangs', 'not', 'having', 'mom', 'life', 'Even', 'little', 'pre-schooler', 'Michelle', 'tough', 'lesson', 'family', 'separation', 'beloved', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'married', 'considers', 'moving', 'out', 'good', 'three', 'were', 'always', 'very', 'cute', 'now', 'are', 'getting', 'older', 'material', 'given', 'becoming', 'stronger', 'fitting', 'talent.The', 'impressively', 'quick-paced', 'release', 'Full', 'House', 'DVD', 'been', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'long-time', 'fans', 'series', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'already', 'been', 'released', 'obvious', 'success', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'had', 'am', 'sure', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Seasons', '5-8', 'near', 'future']",Full House: Season 4
