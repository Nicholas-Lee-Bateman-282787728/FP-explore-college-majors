1335649,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B003BJO8NC,Compay,"[7, 7]","Enemies Among Us was written, directed and produced by Dan Garcia, better known to New Orleanians as 1/2 of the former No Limit Records rap duo Kane & Abel.  I was excited and surprised to see that he was able to cast a variety of veteran actors, and was looking forward to this film.It's bad.  While the production value is a step up from his past movies, the story and dialogue are simply awful.  There's virtually no action or fast pacing in this film, most of the movie is made of dialogue scenes that drag on forever.  The story jumps around, and the speaking scenes are painfully boring.  Add to that the Governor is being chased by the world's worst hitmen, all while being protected by someone on their first day as a state trooper (typical job for newbies, apparently).Billy Zane is front and center on the DVD cover, but he has literally four minutes of screen time in the entire film.  Eric Roberts gets not much more screen time as a quirky state trooper.  Both he and Robin Givens give ""so where's my check"" performances.  Steven Bauer (Manolo in Scarface) isn't even credited on IMDB as having appeared in this movie, I wouldn't be surprised if it was at his agent's request.The cinematography was decent, the lighting was good, as was the color correction.  That's really the only reason why the film is getting two stars and not one.  Otherwise it has a veteran cast that isn't used to it's potential, a terrible plot, and horrible dialogue.  This movie wasn't worth a Redbox rental, I can't imagine why anyone would actually buy the DVD.",2,Experienced Cast Can't Save Boring Movie,1275523200,"06 3, 2010",2010,1554,"['Enemies', 'Us', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'produced', 'Dan', 'Garcia', 'better', 'known', 'New', 'Orleanians', '1/2', 'former', 'No', 'Limit', 'Records', 'rap', 'duo', 'Kane', 'Abel', 'was', 'excited', 'surprised', 'see', 'was', 'able', 'cast', 'variety', 'veteran', 'actors', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'film.It', 'bad', 'production', 'value', 'step', 'up', 'past', 'movies', 'story', 'dialogue', 'are', 'simply', 'awful', 'virtually', 'action', 'fast', 'pacing', 'film', 'most', 'movie', 'made', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'drag', 'forever', 'story', 'jumps', 'speaking', 'scenes', 'are', 'painfully', 'boring', 'Add', 'Governor', 'being', 'chased', 'world', 'worst', 'hitmen', 'being', 'protected', 'someone', 'first', 'day', 'state', 'trooper', 'typical', 'job', 'newbies', 'apparently', '.Billy', 'Zane', 'front', 'center', 'DVD', 'cover', 'literally', 'four', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'entire', 'film', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'quirky', 'state', 'trooper', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'give', 'so', 'where', 'check', 'performances', 'Steven', 'Bauer', 'Manolo', 'Scarface', ""n't"", 'even', 'credited', 'IMDB', 'having', 'appeared', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'was', 'agent', 'request.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'decent', 'lighting', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'color', 'correction', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'getting', 'two', 'stars', 'not', 'one', 'Otherwise', 'veteran', 'cast', ""n't"", 'used', 'potential', 'terrible', 'plot', 'horrible', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'Redbox', 'rental', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'actually', 'buy', 'DVD']",Enemies Among Us

When I watch a movie I would like to be entertained not 90 minutes of hate propaganda from the left or right with no real plot to the movie except to portray everyone as evil.  1/4 of a what appears to be a middle easterner being tortured by Robin Givens and friends.  You do get to hear a hate tirade against the US.  What do they want to know---don't know?  What did they find out--nothing!  Toss in some waterboarding and then kill him.  Why was this in the movie--don't know?  An evil governor is almost assassinated by a hooker that he is going to get on down with before a campaign party.  He turns the tide, gets the best of her, finds out she is part of a 4 man hit team and then strangles her.  Why did he strangle her--don't know?  Why didn't he tell his guards about the hit team--don't know?  Evidently this is to show how evil he is as he bribes the two policemen on hand to show how corrupt the cops are.  Why did he just happen to have a million dollars handy in his briefcase--don't know?  Getting to see the pattern here.  The good cop (who was cheating on his wife and kids with his other female police officer)  feels he has to rush the governor from the hotel out to safety (where he gets killed) so then he can arrest him.  Just a confusing piece of garbage with no purpose at all. Badly edited.
