Followed the series until they took it off in the U.S. I already had Seasons 1 - 4, so I purchased this when I saw it was the season 5 (as labeled). WRONG. This is a CONTINUATION of Season 4. The labeling is all messed up. I went to tv dot com so I could see which episodes are supposed to be in which season. The episodes listed on this disk are all for SEASON FOUR. I went to amazon's UK site & customers there have written and said the ""TRUE"" season 5 will be released later this year as ""The Final Season."" I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because of the *TRAGIC* mis labeling and confusion.UPDATE: Went to amazon.ca (canada version) They have the correct fifth season named ""The Final Season"" available for pre-order with a release date of August 27th.

It moved around so much between networks and then days and times and I could not find the new seasons until they'd already started.  I would like it if the DVD's were subtitled but the Canadian versions are not; however they are much better quality than the CBS American version.

However, as all US fans know, the US DVD Sets are not the actual ""Seasons"", per-say. They're the episodes as aired here in the US. So, the ""5th Season"" DVD Set is actually the last 11 episodes of the 4th Season!That being stated, I still am thrilled to own this Set. Most of the episodes that really resonated w/ me are on this ""5th Season"". Episodes like 'Day Game, 'Blue On Blue', 'Cost Of Doing Business', & 'Slow Burn'! I've been really looking forward to owning these episodes on disc, & am excited that they're finally out!The DVD Set in & of itself is the same as the previous 4 Seasons ; packaged in the ""tray-stack"" style, which saves space. Great picture, & both Dolby Digital 5.1 & 2.0 Surround. There are 3 discs in this Set.I truly hope that the actual Season 5 episodes (which were great) are released eventually. I don't know how they would package them ; they can't call it 'The Sixth Season'. An earlier reviewer stated that they will be put out as ""The Final Season"", which would be a good way to release the last 13 episodes. For now, I'm just thrilled that the remaining Season 4 episodes that I love are finally out on DVD.

I just hope that they are releasing the entire season and not just a few episodes like they did with season 4. I don't know if anyone knows this but with season four you only got the first 12 episodes. Episodes 13-24 which aired on ION TV were never released on DVD in the United States. Even if you buy the entire series on DVD from Amazon and B&N you are still only getting 63 out of the 75 episodes. But never fear because I am about to let you in on a little secret that not many Flashpoint fans in America know about. If you want to get the complete Flashpoint seasons on DVD simply go to [...]. This is the official online store for CTV's hit series Flashpoint. The complete sets are Region 1 for the U.S. and Canada and a little on the pricy side but you will get all of the episodes for seasons 1 through 4. Season five has not yet been given a release date in Canada but last year season 4 was released in mid October. I know it's a long ways off but I promise you that it will be totally worth the wait. I am planning on buying the complete series from them because I know that I will be getting EXACTLY what I paid for; all 75 episodes.,5,Hope it's the entire fifth season,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,1237,"['easily', 'favorite', 'show', 'TV', 'days', 'Very', 'upset', 'coming', 'end', 'just', 'hope', 'are', 'releasing', 'entire', 'season', 'not', 'just', 'few', 'episodes', 'did', 'season', '4', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'season', 'four', 'only', 'got', 'first', '12', 'episodes', 'Episodes', '13-24', 'aired', 'ION', 'TV', 'were', 'never', 'released', 'DVD', 'United', 'States', 'Even', 'buy', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'B', 'N', 'are', 'still', 'only', 'getting', '63', '75', 'episodes', 'never', 'fear', 'am', 'let', 'little', 'secret', 'not', 'many', 'Flashpoint', 'fans', 'America', 'know', 'want', 'get', 'complete', 'Flashpoint', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'simply', 'go', '[', ']', 'official', 'online', 'store', 'CTV', 'hit', 'series', 'Flashpoint', 'complete', 'sets', 'are', 'Region', '1', 'U.S.', 'Canada', 'little', 'pricy', 'side', 'will', 'get', 'episodes', 'seasons', '1', '4', 'Season', 'five', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'given', 'release', 'date', 'Canada', 'last', 'year', 'season', '4', 'was', 'released', 'mid', 'October', 'know', 'long', 'ways', 'promise', 'will', 'be', 'totally', 'worth', 'wait', 'am', 'planning', 'buying', 'complete', 'series', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'paid', '75', 'episodes']",Flashpoint: Season 5
