1602024,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B009T4RQ3M,MadMacs,"[3, 4]","Another enjoyable, but too brief, turn at the 'Idiot' series. The twist, and you knew there had to be one, is that Karl is paired with a mate this time around.To finish off the reported absolute final in the series, the intention was to go out with a bang. And to address that, our man had requested a traveling companion; obviously hoping that Rickey would join him in a not-so-subtle attempt to embarrass and humiliate his primary tormentor.Cackling Gervais had other plans.Bridging seasons two and three, Warwick Davis, the actor from 'Willow' and a host of other films, joins Karl on the Marco Polo Route. You might recall it was he whom Karl had called from the final scene in Season Two's final&eacute; in China.His reaction upon learning who would be accompanying him: ""I don't know how it will work out, honestly. Edmund Hillary had that Tenzing fellow, Ben Fogle had James Cracknell. I've been given an Ewok."" Incredibly, said right in front of his would-be partner. No hesitation, no social grace, uttered from the perspective of a boorish - if perceptive - child. Sometimes I wonder if Karl does this intentionally, with some deeper sense of gaining television ratings. But then I realize - no, like it or not, he's just brutally honest.Following in the footsteps of the great Venetian trader, so begins the pair's adventure.Season Three's comedy comes in the contrasting form of Warwick's tenacity and willingness to accept the differences between various peoples and their cultures - and Karl being himself. Still, it would be disingenuous to say this was all tickles and giggles. The brevity of this season certainly limits the potential for humor, as we don't get to see the team really worn down to the point where conflict can truly generate gut-busting laughs. Simultaneously explaining the understandable sympathetic undertone to the series; dampening what could've been possible. One knows that pushing too hard with certain people can easily cross the line into cruelty. But thankfully Karl pushes right up to that line.Example: When the pair are in Szechuan, the goal is The 10 Faced Buddha Temple on Mount Emei. Thousands of stone steps, more than 1,000 meters up the side of a mountain, Warwick breaks down. Not physically, but mentally. Though one might be hard pressed to see the difference.Karl did.Nobly redeeming himself from the shameful ""carnival"" episode - he utilizes reverse psychology and pushes Warwick to conquer the mountain. Literally. And I couldn't help but think back to Mount Fuji. Remember? The manc climbed for a stunning 18 hours straight! So recall that before you pass judgment as he prods and cajoles the film star, whose tears reveal that he was indeed on the verge of defeat. Sympathetically, Karl had been there himself and wouldn't allow Warwick to take the easy road and quit.Overall, very enjoyable. But obviously three episodes aren't nearly enough to fulfill a true season of programming. This seemed less a journey and more a brief excursion. For myself, I hope that one day Rickey & Co considers doing ""Pole to Pole"". Honestly, in my opinion, that would be insanely funny. Today, there are now at least two active war zones along Palin's original path of 30 degrees east longitude.Active War Zone + Karl = Fun hijinks.Let the games begin! :-DSeries Notes:- Due to Warwick's challenges, the likely explanation for the brevity of the third series; which sadly comprised all of three episodes and a fourth special sit-down dissection.- Co-host Stephen Merchant's non-presence was due to his work on a film. Unfortunate. It's his humorous insights that often give Gervais the more rounded approach to admonishing our man.",4,"Less A Journey, More A Brief Excursion",1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,3676,"['enjoyable', 'too', 'brief', 'turn', ""'Idiot"", 'series', 'twist', 'knew', 'there', 'had', 'be', 'one', 'Karl', 'paired', 'mate', 'time', 'finish', 'off', 'reported', 'absolute', 'final', 'series', 'intention', 'was', 'go', 'out', 'bang', 'address', 'man', 'had', 'requested', 'traveling', 'companion', 'obviously', 'hoping', 'Rickey', 'would', 'join', 'not-so-subtle', 'attempt', 'embarrass', 'humiliate', 'primary', 'tormentor.Cackling', 'Gervais', 'had', 'other', 'plans.Bridging', 'seasons', 'two', 'three', 'Warwick', 'Davis', 'actor', ""'Willow"", 'host', 'other', 'films', 'Karl', 'Marco', 'Polo', 'Route', 'might', 'recall', 'was', 'whom', 'Karl', 'had', 'called', 'final', 'scene', 'Season', 'Two', 'final', 'eacute', 'China.His', 'reaction', 'learning', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'accompanying', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'honestly', 'Edmund', 'Hillary', 'had', 'Tenzing', 'fellow', 'Ben', 'Fogle', 'had', 'James', 'Cracknell', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'Ewok', 'Incredibly', 'said', 'right', 'front', 'would-be', 'partner', 'hesitation', 'social', 'grace', 'uttered', 'perspective', 'boorish', 'perceptive', 'child', 'Sometimes', 'wonder', 'Karl', 'intentionally', 'deeper', 'sense', 'gaining', 'television', 'ratings', 'then', 'realize', 'not', 'just', 'brutally', 'honest.Following', 'footsteps', 'great', 'Venetian', 'trader', 'so', 'pair', 'adventure.Season', 'Three', 'comedy', 'contrasting', 'form', 'Warwick', 'tenacity', 'willingness', 'accept', 'differences', 'various', 'peoples', 'cultures', 'Karl', 'being', 'Still', 'would', 'be', 'disingenuous', 'say', 'was', 'tickles', 'giggles', 'brevity', 'season', 'certainly', 'potential', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'team', 'really', 'worn', 'down', 'point', 'where', 'conflict', 'can', 'truly', 'generate', 'gut-busting', 'laughs', 'Simultaneously', 'explaining', 'understandable', 'sympathetic', 'undertone', 'series', 'dampening', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'possible', 'One', 'pushing', 'too', 'hard', 'certain', 'people', 'can', 'easily', 'cross', 'line', 'cruelty', 'thankfully', 'Karl', 'pushes', 'right', 'up', 'line.Example', 'When', 'pair', 'are', 'Szechuan', 'goal', '10', 'Faced', 'Buddha', 'Temple', 'Mount', 'Emei', 'Thousands', 'stone', 'steps', 'more', '1,000', 'meters', 'side', 'mountain', 'Warwick', 'down', 'Not', 'physically', 'mentally', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'see', 'difference.Karl', 'did.Nobly', 'redeeming', 'shameful', 'carnival', 'episode', 'reverse', 'psychology', 'pushes', 'Warwick', 'conquer', 'mountain', 'Literally', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'back', 'Mount', 'Fuji', 'Remember', 'manc', 'climbed', 'stunning', '18', 'hours', 'straight', 'So', 'recall', 'pass', 'judgment', 'film', 'star', 'tears', 'reveal', 'was', 'indeed', 'verge', 'defeat', 'Sympathetically', 'Karl', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'Warwick', 'take', 'easy', 'road', 'quit.Overall', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'obviously', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'enough', 'fulfill', 'true', 'season', 'programming', 'seemed', 'less', 'journey', 'more', 'brief', 'excursion', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'Rickey', 'Co', 'doing', 'Pole', 'Pole', 'Honestly', 'opinion', 'would', 'be', 'insanely', 'funny', 'Today', 'are', 'now', 'least', 'two', 'active', 'war', 'zones', 'Palin', 'original', 'path', '30', 'degrees', 'east', 'longitude.Active', 'War', 'Zone', '+', 'Karl', '=', 'Fun', 'hijinks.Let', 'games', 'begin', '-DSeries', 'Notes', 'Due', 'Warwick', 'challenges', 'likely', 'explanation', 'brevity', 'third', 'series', 'sadly', 'comprised', 'three', 'episodes', 'fourth', 'special', 'sit-down', 'dissection.-', 'Co-host', 'Stephen', 'Merchant', 'non-presence', 'was', 'due', 'work', 'film', 'Unfortunate', 'humorous', 'insights', 'often', 'give', 'Gervais', 'more', 'rounded', 'approach', 'admonishing', 'man']",N/A
