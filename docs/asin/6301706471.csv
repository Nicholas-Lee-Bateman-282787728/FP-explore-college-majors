The cast was very well put together, although I had to chuckle at Troy Donahue with his obvious false eyelashes. He was prettier than Stephanie Powers! Tina Cole should have had a bigger part but boy was she ever grounded after those ""leather jackets"" trashed her parent's house.  Jerry Van Dyke looks and acts so much like his brother, Dick, that it was hard to tell the difference.  What a comic talent! Connie Stephens did exceptionally well playing the high school kid pretending to be the sophisticated ""tease"".  Her character was very lucky that she didn't get raped by the bad boy of the movie, played by Robert Conrad, in contrast to what happened to Yvette Mimieux's character in ""Where the Boys Are"".  But she manages to come clean in the end and finds true love in hero Stretch (Ty Hardin). Little Billy Mummy was a scene stealer, particularly in the scene where Jerry Van Dyke falls in the pool with the laundry soap and the pool turns into ""the biggest alka seltzer I've ever seen"".  What a hoot!  I was a bit disappointed in the underlying message at the end when Stephanie Powers leaves it up to Troy Donahue to make the decision whether to go all the way, in fear that she will lose him to ""knowing other girls in that way"".  I cringe at the thought of the girl letting the boy make that decision for her, then or now.  All in all, this was a blast from the past- a great movie to watch again and again.",5,The Biggest Alka Seltzer I've Ever Seen,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,1486,"['was', 'fun', '60', 'movie', 'captured', 'essence', 'times', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'had', 'chuckle', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'obvious', 'false', 'eyelashes', 'was', 'prettier', 'Stephanie', 'Powers', 'Tina', 'Cole', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'bigger', 'part', 'boy', 'was', 'ever', 'grounded', 'leather', 'jackets', 'trashed', 'parent', 'house', 'Jerry', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'so', 'much', 'brother', 'Dick', 'was', 'hard', 'tell', 'difference', 'What', 'comic', 'talent', 'Connie', 'Stephens', 'did', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'playing', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'pretending', 'be', 'sophisticated', 'tease', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'lucky', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'raped', 'bad', 'boy', 'movie', 'played', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'contrast', 'what', 'happened', 'Yvette', 'Mimieux', 'character', 'Where', 'Boys', 'Are', 'come', 'clean', 'end', 'true', 'love', 'hero', 'Stretch', 'Ty', 'Hardin', 'Little', 'Billy', 'Mummy', 'was', 'scene', 'stealer', 'particularly', 'scene', 'where', 'Jerry', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'pool', 'laundry', 'soap', 'pool', 'biggest', 'alka', 'seltzer', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'What', 'hoot', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'underlying', 'message', 'end', 'when', 'Stephanie', 'Powers', 'up', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'make', 'decision', 'go', 'way', 'fear', 'will', 'lose', 'knowing', 'other', 'girls', 'way', 'cringe', 'thought', 'girl', 'letting', 'boy', 'make', 'decision', 'then', 'now', 'was', 'blast', 'past-', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'again', 'again']",Palm Springs Weekend VHS

IT'S A BETTER STORY, PERFORMED BY SOME VERY GOOD UP AND COMING ACTORS. I THINK IT WAS THE RAPE SCENE AND ITS AFTERMATH THAT WAS VERY DISTURBING THAT INFLUENCED MY CHOICE BETWEEN THESE TWO FILMS. EVERYBODY WAS SO YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL. IT MAKES YOU WANT TO PACK YOUR BAGS, JUMP ON ""GREYHOUND"" AND HEAD TO ""PALM SPRINGS"". THE THING IS ""PALM SPRINGS"" NO LONGER LOOK LIKE IT DID IN 1963.
