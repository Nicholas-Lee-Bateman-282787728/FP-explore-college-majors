770746,A3B249FQ2OJBCQ,B0000B3FE8,"AstroNerdBoy ""AstroNerdBoy""","[1, 2]","This volume of the 2nd season of Yu Yu Hakusho sadly contains only three episodes.&quot;Beneath Bui's Armor&quot; had Hiei fight the heavily armored Bui.  However, Bui's armor isn't to protect him, but to contain his powers.&quot;Wielder of the Dragon&quot; shows Hiei's mastery of the Kokuryu-ha technique which had before eluded him.NOTICE: The artwork/animation for this episode is completely different and is awful.  I don't know what happened here, but it is shockingly different and unpleasant!&quot;The Shadow of the Elder Toguro&quot; has Kuwabara facing the shape-shifting eldist Toguro brother.As this season draws to a conclusion, many things are what you'd expect from this shounen series.  FUNimation does its usual excellent job with subtitles in which all honorifics (but family ones) are included as well as the fun Japanese phrases attached to the series.  And the English dub voice actors have the spirit of the original Japanese seiyuu down, making it pretty good.  There are some issues of domestication with the English dub script, but since they Japanese subtitles are so well done, I can't complain.The only complaint is the middle episode which frankly isn't FUNimations fault.  But you should know about the shocking change in art styles just the same.",4,Middle Episode -- BAD ART!,1069459200,"11 22, 2003",2003,1277,"['volume', '2nd', 'season', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'sadly', 'only', 'three', 'episodes.', 'quot', 'Beneath', 'Bui', 'Armor', 'quot', 'had', 'Hiei', 'fight', 'heavily', 'armored', 'Bui', 'However', 'Bui', 'armor', ""n't"", 'protect', 'contain', 'powers.', 'quot', 'Wielder', 'Dragon', 'quot', 'Hiei', 'mastery', 'Kokuryu-ha', 'technique', 'had', 'eluded', 'him.NOTICE', 'artwork/animation', 'episode', 'completely', 'different', 'awful', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'shockingly', 'different', 'unpleasant', 'quot', 'Shadow', 'Elder', 'Toguro', 'quot', 'Kuwabara', 'facing', 'shape-shifting', 'eldist', 'Toguro', 'brother.As', 'season', 'conclusion', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'shounen', 'series', 'FUNimation', 'usual', 'excellent', 'job', 'subtitles', 'honorifics', 'family', 'ones', 'are', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'fun', 'Japanese', 'phrases', 'attached', 'series', 'English', 'dub', 'voice', 'actors', 'have', 'spirit', 'original', 'Japanese', 'seiyuu', 'down', 'making', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'issues', 'domestication', 'English', 'dub', 'script', 'Japanese', 'subtitles', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain.The', 'only', 'complaint', 'middle', 'episode', 'frankly', ""n't"", 'FUNimations', 'fault', 'should', 'know', 'shocking', 'change', 'art', 'styles', 'just', 'same']",N/A

The match we've been waiting for on DVD for almost a year since DVD vol. 8, the Dark Tournament Begins.  Now the two are ready to finally fight it out, to the death.  There will only be one left standing.  And will Yusuke be able to defeat his enemy once Toguro powers to %100 percent at last, his power killing the weaker youkai in the process?  Well, the answer's not even in this volume since it's continued into the next one, but be ready for some real kick-butt action!  Oh, and in case you don't know who the guy is during the new end credits, his name is Shinobu Sensui.  He's going to be the next major villain in the series after the Dark Tournament storyline wraps up!

One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper.She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.The final match has started. Toguro unveils his true potential. He is able to increase the size of his muscles. Yusuke is strong, but can he defeat the man that is said to be the strongest.This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",5,Deadly Toguro,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,1412,"['Yusuke', 'Urameshi', 'high', 'school', 'delinquent', ""n't"", 'go', 'class', 'always', 'getting', 'fights', 'One', 'day', 'trying', 'save', 'boy', 'be', 'hit', 'car', 'killed', 'instead', 'approached', 'pretty', 'girl', 'flying', 'broom', 'name', 'Botan', 'Grimm', 'Reaper.She', 'chance', 'regain', 'life', 'coming', 'back', 'life', 'Yusuke', 'Spirit', 'Detective', 'gain', 'spiritual', 'powers', 'hunts', 'down', 'rogue', 'apparitions', 'cause', 'trouble', 'living', 'world', 'joined', 'friend', 'Kuwabara', 'demons', 'Hiei', 'Kurama', 'Together', 'fight', 'off', 'deadly', 'demons', 'seek', 'destroy', 'world.The', 'final', 'match', 'started', 'Toguro', 'true', 'potential', 'able', 'increase', 'size', 'muscles', 'Yusuke', 'strong', 'can', 'defeat', 'man', 'said', 'be', 'strongest.This', 'great', 'series', 'lots', 'cool', 'characters', 'good', 'animation', 'voice', 'acting', 'very', 'engrossing', 'story', 'very', 'long', 'anime', 'so', 'want', 'watch', 'be', 'prepared', 'like', 'spend', 'long', 'time', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'Even', 'bang', 'up', 'start', 'flow', 'would', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'anime', 'series', 'time', 'bit', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'vibe', 'everyone', 'likes', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'anime', 'fan', 'simply', 'amazing']",N/A

I didn't see much of the Kuwabara/Elder Toguro fight but I can mention this: Kuwabara learns of Genkai's death from Elder Toguro and becomes enraged. In his blind and stupid fury, he tries to slice his enemy to bits. Throughout the entire fight, I'm guessing Elder Toguro is sliced up and put together around 2 or 3 times. Eventually, and in a way I wasn't explained in my junky version, Kuwabara defeats Elder Toguro, leaving Yusuke and Younger (yet much more evil) Toguro for the final round of the Dark Tournament!Togoro FINALLY goes to 100% of his power and Yusuke releases his energy in what I think looks like a phoenix.
