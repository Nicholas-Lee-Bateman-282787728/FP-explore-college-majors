It is true that the best part about the film is Joseph Gordon-Levitt-- even in his younger days he was still a very believable actor. At first when I heard his accent, I was thinking ""Oh no...,"" but when he's actually on camera for his longer scenes, you suddenly forget that he's as American as anyone, and has no real accent.Without a doubt, this is a shining moment of young Gordon-Levitt's career (for later standouts, see Forever Lulu, aka Along for the Ride, Sweet Jane, and Manic). Too bad the movie wasn't a little bit better (but it's really not bad).",4,Not as bad as everyone thinks,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,649,"['film', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film-', 'sure', 'bad', 'note', 'pick', 'up', 'true', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'even', 'younger', 'days', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'believable', 'actor', 'first', 'when', 'heard', 'accent', 'was', 'thinking', 'Oh', 'when', 'actually', 'camera', 'longer', 'scenes', 'suddenly', 'forget', 'as', 'American', 'anyone', 'real', 'doubt', 'shining', 'moment', 'young', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'career', 'later', 'standouts', 'see', 'Forever', 'Lulu', 'aka', 'Along', 'Ride', 'Sweet', 'Jane', 'Manic', 'Too', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'really', 'not', 'bad']",N/A

Hilarious is a gross overstatement, and I don't know if I could even qualify this as a comedy. It's lighthearted, so I guess I can go with that. But sexy? We have Marilyn Monroe with crooked teeth, and Havana (Patricia Arquette) bending over in the flower bed (admittedly I noticed that). Is a frock and bonnet supposed to be sexy? How about being married to a 12-year old boy? Peter and Havana rob a state fair. The couple hide out at a religious colony in Canada, eh? Peter hides the money, then promptly gets killed in a car accident. Their bible states that the ex-husband's brother (a very young Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has to propose to the widow. The kid is smart. He ultimately gets Havana to help him bring back the money.
