She probably was not diagnosed which was why she acted like she did-even in her marriage.When I seen her as a child in the movie,even then---she looked unhappy-like everyone's laughing at her-which is why she clenches her fists like she's ready to go off on somebody.That's why she left her mark on the mirror-a picture of her face shedding tears-she was just so unhappy and took it out on innocent schoolchildren who had nothing to do with her issues.I guess life was too painful for her to deal with which was why she decided to end it all.That's the eerieness of it,yet overall,I am glad you had it available as one movie,and I want to thank you so much.I also thank Amazon for having such great sellers like you!",5,I Love This Movie Because It Was a Single  Movie.,1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,1444,"['have', 'had', 'movie', 'only', 'had', '2', 'other', 'movies', 'was', 'not', 'interesting.Once', 'tried', 'looking', 'was', 'unavailable.There', 'were', 'many', 'time', 'ones', 'told', 'go', 'Amazon', 'see', 'was', 'have', 'Internet', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'movie', 'am', 'glad', 'had', 'Thank', 'so', 'much', 'Now', 'movie-I', 'tell', 'you-it', 'was', 'neat-yet', 'had', 'bit', 'eerieness', 'it.The', 'scary', 'part', 'was', 'when', 'lady', 'school', 'shoot', 'innocent', 'children-which', 'was', 'how', 'movie', 'got', 'name.The', 'REAL', 'scary', 'part', 'was', 'suicide-thus', 'leaving', 'mark', 'mirror-she', 'seemed', 'be', 'such', 'unhappy', 'person', 'living', 'severe', 'case', 'depression-with', 'parents', 'being', 'denial', 'probably', 'was', 'not', 'diagnosed', 'was', 'why', 'acted', 'did-even', 'marriage.When', 'seen', 'child', 'movie', 'even', 'then', '-she', 'looked', 'unhappy-like', 'everyone', 'laughing', 'her-which', 'why', 'fists', 'ready', 'go', 'off', 'somebody.That', 'why', 'left', 'mark', 'mirror-a', 'picture', 'face', 'shedding', 'tears-she', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'unhappy', 'took', 'out', 'innocent', 'schoolchildren', 'who', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'issues.I', 'guess', 'life', 'was', 'too', 'painful', 'deal', 'was', 'why', 'decided', 'end', 'eerieness', 'yet', 'overall', 'am', 'glad', 'had', 'available', 'one', 'movie', 'want', 'thank', 'so', 'much.I', 'also', 'thank', 'Amazon', 'having', 'such', 'great', 'sellers']",N/A

1035467,A2NA9CGPX4KJ1U,B000KP62FM,"R. Smith ""bookworm""","[5, 7]","""Murder of Innocence"" is based on the bizarre, tragic story of Laurie Wasserman Dann...a young woman who completely lost touch with sanity and destroyed the lives of those around her, as well as taking her own life.Valerie Bertinelli delivers a riveting performance as Laurie (the name has been changed to Laurie Wade in this film).  It is one of the saddest portrayals of mental illness I've ever seen.  And I believe it is very close to what the real Laurie Dann must have been like.  We, the viewers, will immediately see that something isn't quite right.Bertinelli gives a startling range of emotions...the shyness and deep insecurity Laurie was known for, the anger that occasionally comes to the surface, and finally, her harrowing descent into complete madness.  We see her battling with internal demons and sometimes trying to seek help but never finding the answers.  We see the frustration of her husband and the denial of her well-meaning parents.  We see the horror of who she becomes as a result of her illness.  We see her pain, her rage, her violence, her fear.  We see her inability to cope with life and to hold jobs.  We see how overwhelmed she is at the realization that she has gone too far.To those who have never seen this film before, I suggest an open mind and a strong stomach because there are graphic parts that could possibly make you sick (I'm not kidding).  Spoiler alert...it involves rotten meat and blood/excrement smeared on walls.  Yes, she really did that in real life.  It's interesting that Valerie Bertinelli was chosen for this role because she looked nothing like the real Laurie Dann.  She is far prettier and has a youthful innocence about her.  Nearly every picture of Laurie Dann shows an unattractive woman with a dead-eyed stare.  But maybe this is what allowed Valerie to play Laurie so well...no one would ever suspect a sweet girl of such horrible things, would they?  She is cute and despite her issues, children seem to like her.This movie is important in light of all the mass shootings that have occurred over the years, including the rare cases where women have been the shooters.
