Will max choose the tricks over the treats?RUBY'S LEAF COLLECTIONOne fall day, Ruby asks Max to help with her Leaf Collection Book. Max loves collecting leaves--maybe a little too much!THE BLUE TARANTULAMax wants Ruby to read him the tale of ""The Blue Tarantula"". Will the scary story keep her brother up all night?RUBY'S PANDA PRIZEAt the fair, Ruby really wants to win a panda prize. But will Max's jellyball obsession get in the way?RUBY'S ROLLER SKATESRuby needs to practice so that she can roller-skate to Grandma's house, but Max's tow truck game keeps getting in the way.GHOST BUNNYThe Bunny Scouts can't tell their scary campfire story until Ruby gets Max to sleep. But Max wants to hear the scary story...and make it scarier, too!I'm really not sure what it is about Max & Ruby that enthralls my son so much. In an era of CGI animation, snazzy songs, and fast-paced action, he consistently watches his other Max & Ruby DVD, and now, this video. Ruby is gently bossy, trying to get Max to do what she wants. Max, of course, has his own ideas! (And like my husband asked me the other day ""Where in the world is the mother in this series?"")But my son really enjoys Max & Ruby and it's great that parents and caregivers won't have to worry about innuendo, MTV-paced sequences, shrillness or meanness with these characters.",5,Halloween With Max and Ruby,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,1641,"['bought', 'video', 'son', 'birthday', 'been', 'watching', 'single', 'day', 'sometimes', 'more', 'once', 'day', 'run-time', '48', 'minutes', 'Max', 'Ruby', 'Halloween', '6', 'episodes', 'MAX', 'HALLOWEENMax', 'be', 'vampire', 'Halloween', 'Ruby', 'little', 'prince', 'match', 'Cinderella', 'costume', 'Will', 'max', 'choose', 'tricks', 'treats', 'RUBY', 'LEAF', 'COLLECTIONOne', 'fall', 'day', 'Ruby', 'Max', 'help', 'Leaf', 'Collection', 'Book', 'Max', 'collecting', 'leaves', 'maybe', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'BLUE', 'TARANTULAMax', 'Ruby', 'read', 'tale', 'Blue', 'Tarantula', 'Will', 'scary', 'story', 'keep', 'brother', 'up', 'night', 'RUBY', 'PANDA', 'PRIZEAt', 'fair', 'Ruby', 'really', 'win', 'panda', 'prize', 'will', 'Max', 'jellyball', 'obsession', 'get', 'way', 'RUBY', 'ROLLER', 'SKATESRuby', 'practice', 'so', 'can', 'roller-skate', 'Grandma', 'house', 'Max', 'tow', 'truck', 'game', 'getting', 'way.GHOST', 'BUNNYThe', 'Bunny', 'Scouts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'scary', 'campfire', 'story', 'Ruby', 'Max', 'sleep', 'Max', 'hear', 'scary', 'story', 'make', 'scarier', 'too', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Max', 'Ruby', 'son', 'so', 'much', 'era', 'CGI', 'animation', 'snazzy', 'songs', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'consistently', 'other', 'Max', 'Ruby', 'DVD', 'now', 'video', 'Ruby', 'gently', 'bossy', 'trying', 'get', 'Max', 'do', 'what', 'Max', 'course', 'own', 'ideas', 'husband', 'asked', 'other', 'day', 'Where', 'world', 'mother', 'series', 'son', 'really', 'Max', 'Ruby', 'great', 'parents', 'caregivers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'innuendo', 'MTV-paced', 'sequences', 'shrillness', 'meanness', 'characters']",Max & Ruby's Halloween

914204,A3TSJ46UGNT3QZ,B0009W5IRE,K.,"[3, 3]","I bought my 3 1/2 yr old this DVD about a month ago, and she LOVED it, so I also bought the other 2 Max and Ruby DVDs (the Christmas and Easter ones), and she also loves those.  And the theme of the holiday featured is only on one or two of the many episodes on the DVD, so they are definitely year-round watching.  It is a good value for the amount of shows here.  The show is about Ruby and her little brother Max, and all shows feature them.  Sometimes Ruby's friend is on an episode, sometimes their grandma from down the street, but no parents, just the brother and sister, and they get along wonderfully.  Ruby is so sweet and patient to her little brother, which is a good example for my daughter.  The show is sweet and slow paced with easy plots for little ones to follow.  I would say the age range would be 15 months to 4 years.  This show is 100% for children, though, so it doesn't have the appeal another sweetly paced show, Kipper, that adults would enjoy too (I highly recommend you check out Kipper), but Ruby and Max is truly enjoyed by my little one and is a good investment.(Along with Max and Ruby and Kipper, I also recommend Maggie and the Ferocious Beast-- very sweet too!)",5,Nice children's show,1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,1197,"['bought', '3', '1/2', 'yr', 'old', 'month', 'ago', 'LOVED', 'also', 'bought', 'other', '2', 'Max', 'Ruby', 'DVDs', 'Christmas', 'Easter', 'ones', 'also', 'theme', 'holiday', 'featured', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'many', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', 'definitely', 'year-round', 'watching', 'good', 'value', 'amount', 'shows', 'here', 'show', 'Ruby', 'little', 'brother', 'Max', 'shows', 'feature', 'Sometimes', 'Ruby', 'friend', 'episode', 'sometimes', 'grandma', 'street', 'parents', 'just', 'brother', 'sister', 'get', 'along', 'wonderfully', 'Ruby', 'so', 'sweet', 'patient', 'little', 'brother', 'good', 'example', 'daughter', 'show', 'sweet', 'slow', 'paced', 'easy', 'plots', 'little', 'ones', 'follow', 'would', 'say', 'age', 'range', 'would', 'be', '15', 'months', '4', 'years', 'show', '100', '%', 'children', 'though', ""n't"", 'have', 'appeal', 'sweetly', 'paced', 'show', 'Kipper', 'adults', 'would', 'enjoy', 'too', 'highly', 'recommend', 'check', 'out', 'Kipper', 'Ruby', 'Max', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'little', 'one', 'good', 'investment', 'Max', 'Ruby', 'Kipper', 'also', 'recommend', 'Maggie', 'Ferocious', 'Beast', 'very', 'sweet', 'too']",Max & Ruby's Halloween
