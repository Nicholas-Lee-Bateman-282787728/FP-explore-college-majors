What follows is a crew or more or less cookie cutter monster chow...I mean characters that rummage around various locations trying to figure out what is going on and how to stop the monster, a bit of government conspiracy and allot of tentacles.The biggest flaw about this movie is that the plot is badly written, it is jumbled and at times it is hard to understand what is really going on, there is the ship transporting the first sample and now we are at a oil rig, and then there is a second ship and what...who...where? Other than that I found the movie enjoyable, this is definitely not a masterpiece, however for one and a half hour of entertainment I think it works, the acting is okey and the locations, if confusing, are dark and spooky making them enjoyable.The computer graphics monster in this movie is really, really bad. It is just a bunch of tentacles, which could be cool in an off itself, but the graphics are terribly done, other than that the creature is okey if rather generic. One thing I find odd about the creature however is that it uses so much energy to kill the human characters. The creature is telepathic so it catches it's prey by showing tempting images and luring people close, which is a cool enough ability, however when the creature is huge, have tentacles what can be get to about anywhere and it is quick moving, why do it need to use it's telepathy when the two legged food it intends to kill stands just a few meters away from it? Why not use a tentacle and just snatch him.All in all this is a sub par, generic, sea monster movie, however the creature is interesting and all in all this movie is entertaining, I would recommend to pick it up cheaply as this is not worth full price, however if you can find it in a bargain bin then I think you would like it.",2,Splash go the psychic sea monster!,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,1975,"['Thing', 'Below', 'secret', 'branch', 'military', 'transporting', 'two', 'radioactive', 'rock', 'samples', 'off', 'course', 'samples', 'soon', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'sea', 'monsters', 'get', 'loose', 'What', 'crew', 'more', 'less', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'monster', 'chow', 'mean', 'characters', 'rummage', 'around', 'various', 'locations', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'how', 'stop', 'monster', 'bit', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'allot', 'tentacles.The', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'movie', 'plot', 'badly', 'written', 'jumbled', 'times', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'ship', 'transporting', 'first', 'sample', 'now', 'are', 'oil', 'rig', 'then', 'second', 'ship', 'what', 'who', 'where', 'Other', 'found', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'definitely', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'however', 'one', 'half', 'hour', 'entertainment', 'think', 'acting', 'okey', 'locations', 'confusing', 'are', 'dark', 'spooky', 'making', 'enjoyable.The', 'computer', 'graphics', 'monster', 'movie', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'just', 'bunch', 'tentacles', 'could', 'be', 'cool', 'off', 'graphics', 'are', 'terribly', 'done', 'other', 'creature', 'okey', 'rather', 'generic', 'One', 'thing', 'find', 'odd', 'creature', 'however', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'kill', 'human', 'characters', 'creature', 'telepathic', 'prey', 'showing', 'tempting', 'images', 'luring', 'people', 'close', 'cool', 'enough', 'ability', 'however', 'when', 'creature', 'huge', 'have', 'tentacles', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'get', 'about', 'anywhere', 'quick', 'moving', 'why', 'do', 'need', 'use', 'telepathy', 'when', 'two', 'legged', 'food', 'kill', 'stands', 'just', 'few', 'meters', 'away', 'Why', 'not', 'use', 'tentacle', 'just', 'snatch', 'him.All', 'sub', 'par', 'generic', 'sea', 'monster', 'movie', 'however', 'creature', 'interesting', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'would', 'recommend', 'pick', 'up', 'cheaply', 'not', 'worth', 'full', 'price', 'however', 'can', 'find', 'bargain', 'bin', 'then', 'think', 'would', 'like']",The Thing Below

910736,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B0009PVZT6,Joshua Koppel,"[0, 0]","The trailer promises a movie about an oil rig that lost contact months ago.  The reality is a little different.  The movie begins near the ending and then does a flashback of less than a day.  A research station has drilled a section of the crust and discovered a form of life that is highly radioactive.  With the sample sitting on a table while the storm ship it is on is being tossed about like a toy due to a massive hurricane, it suddenly dawns on the characters that it should be stored in safe keeping.  Watching two deck hands trying to carry it as precariously as possible is almost humorous.Long story short, the organism gets out and the race is on.  Much of the story is told from the vantage of a general trying to find out what happened and is using a computer hacker.  There are other levels of government involvement and the movie seems to make a statement that government involvement is a bad thing.  Some dream-like sequences allow the writers to throw in whatever they want (including a strip routine) but does little for the plot.In the end we have a very convoluted story with lots of unanswered questions.  The explanation for the organism was clever and some of its actions were quite inspired.  But all in all it seems like the writers weren't sure how to tell the story so they used bits of each choice.  Not a bad popcorn film but nothing very memorable either.  I don't feel it was quite successful at what it was tying although it did seem to try.  The special effects were laughable.  The CGI looked like bad cartoons (sort of like the cartoon farmer in Reptilicus) and detracted from the film.
