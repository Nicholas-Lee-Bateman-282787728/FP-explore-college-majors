I would have liked to have seen the scene where Anne has her teacher over and finds a mouse in the jam. The biggest problem I had with the movie was that they combined Diana Barry's mom with Rachel Lynde to form RACHEL BARRY. Could they not afford two actreses? Rachel Lynde is essential to the story and all her children were grown and she was at least in her fifties in the book. Plus, they made Marilla much too harsh. And then there was a scene where Anne and Marilla kissed and it was sure a long kiss. Strange!However, the acting was above par.

501034,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00000G0IF,Byron Kolln,"[22, 23]","This rare 1934 version of ANNE OF GREEN GABLES is completely charming, and more than complements the range of miniseries done by Kevin Sullivan (with Megan Follows as Anne).In this version Dawn O'Day (who later turned her legal name to Anne Shirley) plays the spirited orphan who comes to live with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert (Helen Westley and O.P. Heggie) at their Green Gables farm on Prince Edward Island.Anne quickly makes friends with Diana Barry (Gertrude Messinger)...and makes enemies with Gilbert Blythe (Tom Brown) when she famously breaks a slate over his head!  Their childhood rivalry soon turns into love, as Gilbert and Anne confess their real feelings for each other.This version stays pretty close to the L.M. Montgomery novel...for the most part.  Purists will object to certain liberties taken with the story (Anne and Gilbert's blossoming love almost reaches 'Romeo and Juliet'-style proportions with Marilla trying her best to keep them apart), and the ending seems rushed and in no way follows the timeline of the novel (for instance, Matthew dies in the book wheras he lives here).Anne Shirley (or Dawn O'Day) gives a splendid performance as Anne, Helen Westley (best remembered for her roles in several Shirley Temple movies) is a fantastic Marilla and O.P. Heggie beautifully downplays the role of thoughtful Matthew.  Tom Brown and Gertrude Messinger provide good support as Gilbert and Diana, with Sara Haden as Diana's mother Rachel (the movie combines the roles of Rachel Lynde and Mrs Barry into one character).The lovely music is provided by the one and only Max Steiner.

501039,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00000G0IF,Only-A-Child,"[1, 1]","In ""Anne of Green Gables"" (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (O.P. Heggie), middle-aged siblings who live together at Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, decide to adopt a boy from distant orphanage to help on their farm. But the orphan sent to them is a precocious girl of 14 named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris-a veteran of Disney's series of ""Alice"" shorts who later would adopt her character's name).Anne was only 11 in Lucy Maude Montgomery's source novel but the same actress could not credibly go from 11 to college age during the course of the story.  The movie suffers somewhat from this concession, as many of  Anne's reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining coming from an eleven-year-old that from a teenager.  As in the book, Anne is bright and quick, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, her build, her freckles, and her long red hair. Being a child of imagination, however, Anne takes much joy in life, and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island.In fact this Anne is the original ""Teenage Drama Queen"" and the film's screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character. Which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy. A change that delighted audiences and that continues to frustrate reader purists.Since the comedy is very much in the spirit of the Montgomery's story I can see no reason to take issue with the changes, but let this serve as fair warning to anyone expecting a totally faithful adaptation. The comedy element is the strength of the film as it is one of the earliest self-reflexive parodies of Hollywood conventions. The actress Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood's all- time beauties and the film is in black and white. So much of the amusement is in seeing the title character's endless laments about her appearance and hair color contradicted by what is appearing on the screen. Anne regularly regales her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like: ""If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me"". Perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom blackboard.Tom Brown does a nice job as Anne's love interest Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steals all the scenes in which she appears as the Cuthbert's pompous neighbor.Then again, what do I know?

I think the main issue with this film is that the filmmakers tried to cram an entire series of books into an hour and a half and it just didn't work too well. The actress who played young Anne (Anne Shirley) was too old. Although she did her best to appear innocent and naive, at times she comes off as a bit creepy in a bad seed type of way, since she was trying to play younger than she was.  I found the actor and actress who played Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert did well, and of course the scenery was beautiful. But they had to take liberties with the plot in order to make the film cohesive, so for instance, Gilbert becomes Anne's love interest early on, and their hidden romance a thing of shame. The ending too was altered, but I didn't particularly object to that since it was positive and happy- I've always liked Matthew.Overall if you like Anne, this version is not bad.
