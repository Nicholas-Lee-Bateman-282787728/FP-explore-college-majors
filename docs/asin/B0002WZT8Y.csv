""Gypsy 83"" isn't really about whether or not she wins the competetion, though. The central focus is on the incredible and oftentimes heartfelt bond between Gypsy and Clive, as well as the conflicts/issues they come across along the way. They're constantly having to defend themselves for being ""different"" while Clive struggles with his own sexuality and Gypsy tries to understand why her mother abandoned her and her father (a fellow musician) when she was only a little girl...I found the performances by Kett and Sara to be absolutely spellbinding (these two have real potential in my eyes!). I also thought the guest appearance of Karen Black, who plays a lounge soulstress, rather interesting. I, however, wouldn't go so far as to say this is poetry in motion, but I won't stoop so low as to say this is lame either, as two separate reviewers have claimed. It is simply an average movie, plot wise, yet thoroughly enjoyable--especially for anyone who appreciates the dark, lavish beauty of Gothic culture. The clothes/make-up is fabulous, and the music is killer (get the soundtrack)! Some of my favorite scenes are the ones when Gypsy and Clive are photographing each other in black and white, dancing with their flowy gowns and capes on--or when they're in the cemetery. I particularly loved the shots they did at night with all the candles lit around the tombstones and when Clive was all dressed up like Robert Smith of The Cure, singing and dancing to ""Doing The Unstuck"".All in all this is definitely a film at least worth renting.

I finally got the opportunity to see the Todd Stephens film. The premise revolves around an aspiring teenage photographer named Clive and his twenty-five year old best friend Gypsy Vale. They live in a sleepy town of Sandusky, Ohio. They are considered outcasts because they dress 'funny'. Gypsy Vale is a big Stevie Nicks fan. When Clive discovers that there is a big Stevie Nicks tribute karaoke show in NYC, the two decides now would be a good time to hightail it out of Sandusky, OH.What worked for me was the performances by Kett Turton (Clive) and Sara Rue (Gypsy). I could relate to their angst of not fitting in with their peers and being stuck in a dead end job. I especially enjoyed watching the emotions that Gypsy was going through when she was dealing with her past. What didn't work for me was that there was too much drama in the film and for a while, I forgot that the two friends were driving to NYC to go to The Night of 1000 Stevies.I loved the music in the film. I am a big fan of Diva Destruction, Velvet Acid Christ, and Apoptygma Berzerk. Major props to Todd Stephens for using music that most people wouldn't dare consider using for their films. It was also interesting seeing John Doe and Karen Black make cameo appearances in the film.The film may not be perfect but I still enjoyed it. I found the last half hour particularly moving.

I really connected with this movie. the quality of the acting and the beauty of the production is better than expected. I have been into goth since i was 16 and this film represents everything that it means to me from friendships that are life changing to true happiness from self expression. the music selection is excellent raging from the cure to claire voyant. The final song during the credits lingers in my mind for days and pains my heart that the movie ended. I watched the movie 3 times in a row on the 1st day that i got it and at least once every day after that. The character acting and developement is so beliveable and the atmosphere is so beautiful it grabs your soul. I wont give away the ending but it was a tear jerker and made me not want it to end. The characters are beliveable and love able. gypsy and clive find a shared bond in lost parents that is challenged when certain truths surface. Clive admits that he isnt in love w/ gypsy but he does worship her. its an interesting relationship between an 18 year old and a 25 year old that reminds me of many of my friendships. You get caught in the nostalgia and beauty of the film. some of my best times were on road trips w/ friends getting lost in the moment experiencing and scaring locals by just being yourself. many people feel that people from a dark culture have identity crisis or seek attention. everyone is different and cannot be pigeon-holed. many enjoy fashion and the mystisism and could care less if they are noticed or singled out. there is a scene in the movie where clive and gypsy are dancing to the cure and lost in a happy moment when out side elements intrude and steal the moment. goths can be the most caring people in the world as w/ any one. I suppose if there wasnt any opposition there wouldnt be anything to fight for. This movie will be a classic for me and when im old i can look back to it and remember my youth. this is the best representation of the goth culture yet.

Newton,"[6, 6]","First of all what a fantastic music score, so brilliant it made me dig out all my old Stevie Nicks and Fleetwood Mac albums - and I can very close to going Goth again for the first time in nearly 15 years!Essentially the film is about two teenage misfits in small town USA who run off to New York to the 'Night of a 1000 Stevie's'. Where the girl intends to compete in the soundalike competition. On the way they make contact with a variety of other misfits that add some interesting twists to the overal storyline.The film explores ideas of individuality very accurately - in my opinion. it seems to ask the questions about how far people conform and more importantly why they choose to do so. Neither does the film shy away from recognising that in some situations being different is a conformity in itself - keenly portrayed towards the end of the film during an exchange with two other young men attending the 'Night of 1000 Stevie's'. Importantly it looks at how this sort of non-conformity can be as harsh and excluding as general conformity.I don't see this as a 'gay film', one of the characters happens to be gay and explores this and what it means to him during the film. What is really good is to see a gay young man not conforming to certain 'idealised' types so prevalent in gay cinema. Kett Turton who plays Clive is somewhat geekish and skinny and is much more represenative of young gay men than the toned, tanned, pretty boys we so often see (see my review of 'Like It Is').My favourite scene of the film is Sara Rue's rendition of the Stevie Nicks' song 'Talk to Me'. This young woman has a fantastic voice and I hope both her and Kett do very well for themselves. A great film!

Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[1, 1]","I was intrigued by this movie since the two protagonists (Gypsy and Clive/Robbie) hail from ""small town"" Sandusky, Ohio.  I come from such a small Ohio town that Sandusky (home of the famed resort Cedar Point!) seemed a sophisticated metropolis to me growing up!  Anyway this is an interesting film because of the performances of Sara Rue as twenty-five year old Stevie Nicks worshiping Gypsy and Kett Turton as her best friend high school senior and ""goth"" Clive.  It's basically a road movie as the two who are considered more than a bit weird in their hometown set out from Sandusky to New York City to participate in a Stevie Nicks festival known as  ""Night of a 1,000 Stevies"".  While Rue and Turton's performances are strong this is a far from perfect movie.  Gypsy's back story is well developed but I was confused by Clive's family life.  The hitchhiking Amish farmer and the Ohio State fraternity boys in the camper Gypsy and Clive encounter seem contrived and unrealistic.  Karen Black's performance as a failed lounge singer ""Bambi"" is good but I felt her part did little to move the story forward or give us insight that was not already  obvious concerning Gypsy and Clive.  And some of the scenes at the Pennsylvania rest stop made me blush so the movie is not for the prudish.  The best part of the movie is the friendship between Gypsy and Clive and the movie is worth watching for anyone who wants a ""coming of age"" story that is quite a ways off the beaten path.",4,You'll See Your Gypsy!,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,1479,"['was', 'intrigued', 'movie', 'two', 'protagonists', 'Gypsy', 'Clive/Robbie', 'hail', 'small', 'town', 'Sandusky', 'Ohio', 'come', 'small', 'Ohio', 'town', 'Sandusky', 'home', 'famed', 'resort', 'Cedar', 'Point', 'seemed', 'sophisticated', 'metropolis', 'growing', 'up', 'Anyway', 'interesting', 'film', 'performances', 'Sara', 'Rue', 'twenty-five', 'year', 'old', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'worshiping', 'Gypsy', 'Kett', 'Turton', 'best', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'goth', 'Clive', 'basically', 'road', 'movie', 'two', 'who', 'are', 'considered', 'more', 'bit', 'weird', 'hometown', 'set', 'out', 'Sandusky', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'participate', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'festival', 'known', 'Night', '1,000', 'Stevies', 'Rue', 'Turton', 'performances', 'are', 'strong', 'far', 'perfect', 'movie', 'Gypsy', 'back', 'story', 'well', 'developed', 'was', 'confused', 'Clive', 'family', 'life', 'hitchhiking', 'Amish', 'farmer', 'Ohio', 'State', 'fraternity', 'boys', 'camper', 'Gypsy', 'Clive', 'encounter', 'seem', 'contrived', 'unrealistic', 'Karen', 'Black', 'performance', 'failed', 'lounge', 'singer', 'Bambi', 'good', 'felt', 'part', 'did', 'little', 'move', 'story', 'forward', 'give', 'insight', 'was', 'not', 'already', 'obvious', 'concerning', 'Gypsy', 'Clive', 'scenes', 'Pennsylvania', 'rest', 'stop', 'made', 'blush', 'so', 'movie', 'not', 'prudish', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'friendship', 'Gypsy', 'Clive', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'anyone', 'who', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'quite', 'ways', 'beaten', 'path']",N/A

Now after repeated viewings of the DVD, I see even more to like.Being a huge Stevie Nicks fan, I was blown away by Sara Rue's performance.  She captures the essense of Stevie.  This movie can leave an inpression that Gypsy and Clive are tortured souls who attract misery.  Gyspy lives in the shadow of a mother who left her at a young age.  Clive/Robbie deals with the deaths of this parents and brother.  Gyspy has her father who treats Gypsy like a wife.  After repeated viewings, I realized these characters are being shown as survivors of the tragedies of their lives not victims.Gypsy's life is further complicated by living in more than one shadow.  Like her mother, Gypsy has a strong connection to Stevie Nicks or does she??  Is Gypsy's true connection with the spirit of her mother, who was also a Stevie fanatic?  Either way, Gypsy has some big shoes to fill if she truly wants to live up to her idols.The roadtrip to New York is filled with more sadness and tragedy.  Gypsy and Clive encounter Bambi, played by Karen Black.  It's a small, yet powerful role.  Also, along the way is the Amish man who ultimately leaves Gypsy heartbroken yet again, and the fratboy who touches Clives heart and awakens his true sexuality that up until then was a major topic of conversation, but no action.This is a movie, so it is pure fantasy.  For this reason, I can overlook the multiple costume changes along the way...After leaving Bambi's house, Gyspy is without makeup and her hair is a mess.  As soon as she decides to head to NY, she's next seen in great hair, full makeup and a new outfit.  And while it isn't realistic to think someone has enough candles to light up a cemetery or a rest stop, it certainly makes things interesting and is totally in keeping with the whole Stevie Nicks mystique.Gypsy's dream to be like her mother and in turn like Stevie seems a bit out of touch with reality.  Until the end of the movie, Gypsy doesn't impress many as being star material.  She is too meek and inexperienced when she tries to perform like Stevie.But then she performs at Night of a Thousand Stevies and everything changes.  Having just learned her mother died four years ago, Gypsy seems to be liberated by that news.  She isn't performing in her mother's shadow.  She has no expectations to live up to anymore. As she is about to walk out to perform, she removes her ""Stevie"" shawl and appears on stage as a stripped down version of no one but herself.  In that final song, Gypsy finds herself and the strength to really perform.In the final scene, Clive drives away and heads back to Ohio while he looks in the rearview mirror and sees Gypsy twirling in the cemetery...awesome stuff!If there is one disappointment in this film it is the fact that Stevie's ""people"" wouldn't allow the use of any Stevie songs.  Talk To Me, not written by Stevie, is the most used song in the movie along with an Edge of 17 sound alike.  This is a great movie and Stevie should have done the soundtrack...it's a shame she didn't.",5,Amazing,1102118400,"12 4, 2004",2004,3114,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'gay', 'film', 'festival', 'circuit', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'Now', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'DVD', 'see', 'even', 'more', 'like.Being', 'huge', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'fan', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Sara', 'Rue', 'performance', 'essense', 'Stevie', 'movie', 'can', 'leave', 'inpression', 'Gypsy', 'Clive', 'are', 'tortured', 'souls', 'who', 'attract', 'misery', 'Gyspy', 'shadow', 'mother', 'who', 'left', 'young', 'age', 'Clive/Robbie', 'deals', 'deaths', 'parents', 'brother', 'Gyspy', 'father', 'who', 'Gypsy', 'wife', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'realized', 'characters', 'are', 'being', 'shown', 'survivors', 'tragedies', 'lives', 'not', 'victims.Gypsy', 'life', 'further', 'complicated', 'living', 'more', 'one', 'shadow', 'mother', 'Gypsy', 'strong', 'connection', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'Gypsy', 'true', 'connection', 'spirit', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'Stevie', 'fanatic', 'way', 'Gypsy', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'truly', 'live', 'up', 'idols.The', 'roadtrip', 'New', 'York', 'filled', 'more', 'sadness', 'tragedy', 'Gypsy', 'Clive', 'encounter', 'Bambi', 'played', 'Karen', 'Black', 'small', 'yet', 'powerful', 'role', 'Also', 'way', 'Amish', 'man', 'who', 'ultimately', 'Gypsy', 'heartbroken', 'yet', 'again', 'fratboy', 'who', 'Clives', 'heart', 'true', 'sexuality', 'up', 'then', 'was', 'major', 'topic', 'conversation', 'action.This', 'movie', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'reason', 'can', 'overlook', 'multiple', 'costume', 'changes', 'way', 'leaving', 'Bambi', 'house', 'Gyspy', 'makeup', 'hair', 'mess', 'As', 'soon', 'head', 'NY', 'next', 'seen', 'great', 'hair', 'full', 'makeup', 'new', 'outfit', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'think', 'someone', 'enough', 'candles', 'light', 'up', 'cemetery', 'rest', 'stop', 'certainly', 'things', 'interesting', 'totally', 'keeping', 'whole', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'mystique.Gypsy', 'dream', 'be', 'mother', 'turn', 'Stevie', 'bit', 'touch', 'reality', 'end', 'movie', 'Gypsy', ""n't"", 'impress', 'many', 'being', 'star', 'material', 'too', 'meek', 'inexperienced', 'when', 'perform', 'Stevie.But', 'then', 'Night', 'Thousand', 'Stevies', 'everything', 'changes', 'Having', 'just', 'learned', 'mother', 'died', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'Gypsy', 'be', 'liberated', 'news', ""n't"", 'performing', 'mother', 'shadow', 'expectations', 'live', 'up', 'anymore', 'about', 'walk', 'perform', 'Stevie', 'shawl', 'stage', 'stripped', 'down', 'version', 'one', 'final', 'song', 'Gypsy', 'strength', 'really', 'perform.In', 'final', 'scene', 'Clive', 'away', 'back', 'Ohio', 'rearview', 'mirror', 'sees', 'Gypsy', 'twirling', 'cemetery', 'awesome', 'stuff', 'one', 'disappointment', 'film', 'fact', 'Stevie', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'use', 'Stevie', 'songs', 'Talk', 'Me', 'not', 'written', 'Stevie', 'most', 'used', 'song', 'movie', 'Edge', '17', 'sound', 'alike', 'great', 'movie', 'Stevie', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'soundtrack', 'shame', 'did', ""n't""]",N/A

I love Edge of Seventeen, another film by Todd Stephens, but this one is much weaker.  Having been both an outsider and someone who was into goth culture, I can certainly relate to the characters and plot. But therein lies the problem. The plot is very thin and needed to be fleshed out much, much more.  We don't get to see much of the characters histories or what makes them tick. There is no sense of how these relationships are formed. The editing is very strange, with Sara Rue suddenly appearing in full makeup and different outfits, in the same scene!  Karen Black is excellent in a small but touching part as a singer who never made it.  The really weak link in the film is unfortunately, Sara Rue.  Though her basic acting in the scenes is not bad, she does not come across as someone who is a really special performer.  When she is supposed to be this magical, twirling, Stevie Nicks type of person, she falls flat. She doesn't move like Stevie, she barely moves at all and she seems almost embarrassed at having to do this for the film.  If you look at a rock star like Stevie, their movements are infused with forceful energy and emotion. In contrast, Sara Rue's character seems limp and lifeless. It's like some uptight girl waving her arm around once or twice and going, ""look, I'm Stevie Nicks!""  And while I realize the character of Gypsy is supposed to be insecure and not confident as a performer, which is perhaps what Rue was attempting, there is nothing in the performance that suggests a special quality in Gypsy.  The singing, which is billed as Rue's own, is terrible.Even at the end of the film, where Rue is supposed to be confident, her physical movements seem weak and lifeless.I felt Clive was a more fully realized and interesting character. All in all, a somewhat cute but not quite good film.
