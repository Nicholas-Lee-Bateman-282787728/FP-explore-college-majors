940056,AD4CDZK7D31XP,B000BC8SVK,Anthony Accordino,"[12, 12]","What a great surprise, to find out that jazz/funk super group STUFF has finally seen the light of day on an official DVD release.  During the seventies and eighties, this group of super session artists, were the most in demand studio musicians on the planet.  Everyone from Aretha Franklin, Paul Simon, Ray Charles, Art Garfunkel, George Harrison, Grover Washington JR, Dianne Schurr, and Joe Cocker to name a few, used these guys in some shape or form on their records.  When not recording for others, Stuff made their own brand of high octane Jazz/rock fusion,  releasing several successful albums along the way.  This DVD captures STUFF in 1976, live at the Montreaux Jazz Festival.  They gained world-wide popularity, especially in Japan and of course New York, where they not only lived, but played all the big jazz clubs on a weekly basis.  Big Gordan Edwards-Bass guitar, Steve Gadd-Drums, Cornell Dupree-guitar, and the late Richard Tee and Eric Gale on keyboards and guitar, made some of the finest funkified jazz/fusion ever waxed.  This concert features some of their most intense instrumentals ever.  Their sound is like no other, as we get to hear and see the late Eric Gale trade guitar licks with the great Cornell Dupree.  As I have said before, they are the equivalent of Clapton and Allman, only in the Jazz/funk mode.  Richard Tee's driving piano along with Steve Gadd on Drums provide the viewer with performance they will soon not forget.  And anchoring that great rhythm section, was Big Gordon Edwards, who comes across like a captain running a flawless voyage.  Such tunes as ""Foots"", ""Signed Sealed Delivered, ""How Long Will It Last"", ""Stuff's Stuff"", and ""Boogie On Reggae Woman"", will put the listener into overdrive, like a well tuned sports car.  During this time period, they were touring with Joe Cocker as well, so they serve up a funky version of ""Feelin alright"", and a great version of ""You Are So Beautiful"".  There are 13 tracks in all, with a respectable picture and sound, considering this was taped 32 years ago.  Gordon Edwards, and Chris Rea offer some very informative liner notes, and most notably, is that this is the only known STUFF perfomance in existance.  To the surviving members of Stuff, Gordon Edwards, Steve Gadd, Cornell Dupree,and Chris Parker, and to the late Richard Tee and Eric Gale, I say thank-you for all those wonderful evenings at Mikell's at 97th and Columbus Ave, in New York City.  This DVD and the companion CD comes with my highest recommendation, for all those who were there at the beginning like myself, and remained lifelong Stuff fans.",5,Newly Discovered Live Stuff!,1216771200,"07 23, 2008",2008,2611,"['What', 'great', 'surprise', 'find', 'out', 'jazz/funk', 'super', 'group', 'STUFF', 'finally', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'official', 'DVD', 'release', 'seventies', 'eighties', 'group', 'super', 'session', 'artists', 'were', 'most', 'demand', 'studio', 'musicians', 'planet', 'Everyone', 'Aretha', 'Franklin', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Grover', 'Washington', 'JR', 'Dianne', 'Schurr', 'Joe', 'Cocker', 'name', 'few', 'used', 'guys', 'shape', 'form', 'records', 'When', 'not', 'recording', 'others', 'Stuff', 'made', 'own', 'brand', 'high', 'octane', 'Jazz/rock', 'fusion', 'releasing', 'several', 'successful', 'albums', 'way', 'DVD', 'STUFF', '1976', 'live', 'Montreaux', 'Jazz', 'Festival', 'gained', 'world-wide', 'popularity', 'especially', 'Japan', 'course', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'not', 'only', 'lived', 'played', 'big', 'jazz', 'clubs', 'weekly', 'basis', 'Big', 'Gordan', 'Edwards-Bass', 'guitar', 'Steve', 'Gadd-Drums', 'Cornell', 'Dupree-guitar', 'late', 'Richard', 'Tee', 'Eric', 'Gale', 'keyboards', 'guitar', 'made', 'finest', 'funkified', 'jazz/fusion', 'ever', 'waxed', 'concert', 'most', 'intense', 'instrumentals', 'ever', 'sound', 'other', 'get', 'hear', 'see', 'late', 'Eric', 'Gale', 'trade', 'guitar', 'great', 'Cornell', 'Dupree', 'have', 'said', 'are', 'equivalent', 'Clapton', 'Allman', 'only', 'Jazz/funk', 'mode', 'Richard', 'Tee', 'driving', 'piano', 'Steve', 'Gadd', 'Drums', 'provide', 'viewer', 'performance', 'will', 'soon', 'not', 'forget', 'anchoring', 'great', 'rhythm', 'section', 'was', 'Big', 'Gordon', 'Edwards', 'who', 'captain', 'running', 'flawless', 'voyage', 'Such', 'tunes', 'Foots', 'Signed', 'Sealed', 'Delivered', 'How', 'Long', 'Will', 'Last', 'Stuff', 'Stuff', 'Boogie', 'Reggae', 'Woman', 'will', 'put', 'listener', 'overdrive', 'well', 'tuned', 'sports', 'car', 'time', 'period', 'were', 'touring', 'Joe', 'Cocker', 'as', 'well', 'serve', 'up', 'funky', 'version', 'Feelin', 'alright', 'great', 'version', 'Are', 'So', 'Beautiful', 'are', '13', 'tracks', 'respectable', 'picture', 'sound', 'considering', 'was', 'taped', '32', 'years', 'ago', 'Gordon', 'Edwards', 'Chris', 'Rea', 'offer', 'very', 'informative', 'liner', 'notes', 'most', 'notably', 'only', 'known', 'STUFF', 'perfomance', 'existance', 'surviving', 'members', 'Stuff', 'Gordon', 'Edwards', 'Steve', 'Gadd', 'Cornell', 'Dupree', 'Chris', 'Parker', 'late', 'Richard', 'Tee', 'Eric', 'Gale', 'say', 'thank-you', 'wonderful', 'evenings', 'Mikell', '97th', 'Columbus', 'Ave', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'DVD', 'companion', 'CD', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'beginning', 'remained', 'lifelong', 'Stuff', 'fans']",N/A
940057,A31KXTOQNTWUVM,B000BC8SVK,Bill Board,"[3, 6]","Another reviewer, above, has referred to this DVD as the ""holy grail"" of DVDs, and that right there alone is the best review I've noted about ""WR Montreux '76.""  One simply cannot disagree.  Oh, and I apologize to all the WR (or, for THAT matter) Stones' purists who don't appreciate me ""mixing metaphors"" there in the title to this review, but calling ""WR Montreux '76's"" performance as the ""Mick Taylor-era,"" is the only way to describe it. And by that, you know I mean SUPERLATIVE.  Yes I do have the Erskine-era DVD from ""Forecast Tomorrow,"" which is most excellent (and, oh yes, I'm embarrassed to admit that I even have J Mitchell's loopy ""Shadows And Light"" DVD JUST ONLY because Jaco was her bassist that time out).  But ""WR Live '76"" takes them all, if for nothing more than the Alex Acuna/Manalo Badrena percussion section.  These 2 guys, working off the other, elict smiles from all, even from the normally taciturn J Zawniul - the one Gentleman, I reiterate, who is the ONLY PERSON in all of recorded history, that knows how to use a synthesizer (except...maybe Jack Nitzche). And here on ""Live '76,"" Badrena/Acuna's precursor to their ""Rhumba Mama"" which they recorded (live again!) on ""Heavy Weather"" is hilarious; but all the while, you just sit there, astounded at the ""percussive brilliance"" (hey, I just made that up!) of those two guys.  Wayne Shorter, evidentally, must be putting out a lot of effort here (or maybe the place was just hot), because the camera repeatedly has close-ups of him sweating - not at ALL the respect a man of his brilliance deserves.  And Jaco had, just 4 months previously, replaced Alphonso Johnson as WR's bassist.  I hate...no, I DON'T ""hate"" either, I dig the Stones:  Deal with it; but, carrying the ""Stones' metaphor"" a bit further, this ""Live '76"" DVD really reminded me of that ""Stones In Hyde Park"" DVD, (Mick Taylor's first appearance with the Stones), because it, too, was a representation of an irreplaceable musician's first performance with their respective bands.  Wow...Jaco and Mick - MAN! wouldn't that've made one hell of a ""Trio Of Doom"" with Tony Williams!  Ah, one can only fantasize! And now that I possess Brecht/Weill's ""Rise And Fall Of The City Of Mahagonny,"" Nesmith's brilliant-to-this-very-DAY's ""Elephant Parts,"" Mick's ""Performance,"" the Georgio Moroder ""Metropolis,"" and a DVD of the Allman Brothers with Duane and Berry, I believe that, once I receive that final Procol Harum DVD, I can cease purchasing music DVDs - which will make Dearest-On-Earth extremely happy...well, that is, until a DVD is made available of the entire ""Ringo's Fourth All Starr Band...""",5,"EXCELLENT!

940058,A1X73QJ7D1W57Q,B000BC8SVK,Bodhi Heeren,"[3, 3]","While worldclass musicians kept revolving around the nucleus of the band: keyboard wizzard and sonic genius Joe Zawinul and transcendental saxplayer Wayne Shorter, I think it's fair to say that this line-up, who went on to record their groundbreaking hit-album ""Heavy Weather"", was the classic one.With the dynamic southamerican percussion/drum duo of Manolo Badrena and Alex Acu&ntilde;a. And basslegend Jaco Pastorius, the master of the fretless bass, who not only had the chops, but also - as this DVD shows - like his great idol Jimi Hendrix the stage-presence and the charisma of a true star. His solo-piece ""Portrait Of Tracy"" gives convincing evidence to why so many consider him the best bassist ever. But also his ensemble playing is brilliantly funky all the way.I was very fortunate to see this band in Copenhagen the year after, and the words that kept resounding in my head during and after was 'electric church music'(the phrase Hendrix used to describe is more far our musical visions). And listening to this Montreux show certainly confirms my impression of a high soaring band, with roots in the earth and the minds firmly planted in deep space.The only surprise is how relatively 'thin' Zawinul's keyboardsound is. Not least compared with his latest brilliant recordings: ""Bird Jam"" (mainly with african musicians) and ""Brown Street"" (with german Big Band). Makes me realize that the stern-faced Austrian visionary actually sounds and plays better than ever at 75!If one should complain about anything, it should be the relatively short duration. But while the claim in the linernotes that this band cover more ground in an hour than most others do in a year might be slightly exaggerated, it's certainly not completely off the mark.All in all another fine release in the exciting ""Live at Montreux""-series.

940059,A1XL5L0AQXPCKB,B000BC8SVK,Brian Whistler,"[58, 60]","For many of us Weather Report fanatics this is the Holy Grail of WP live videos. If you're like me, you already own a bootleg of this show. I have two, the second being slightly better in quality to the first, with even  a hand held audience camera (horrible quality) filling in Dr Honora ex Causa/Directions tune which was missing from the television broadcast from whence the bootleg was born.But this is a whole other level of quality. The good folks at Eagle Vision should be commended for taking the original filmed concert and lovingly restoring it to its full length. Even more impressive than the crystal clear video and continuity is the superior sound. We are given no less than three formats to choose from, Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS(!) and PCM stereo. The DTS sounds great on my system, putting this outstanding performance under  an aural magnifying glass. One can hear so many details that the first viewing/listening was startling, even though I have viewed the bootleg countless times. The PCM stereo version is also superb-encoded as it is @48k and 16 bit, it surpasses CD specs and sounds it too, considering the 1976 concert quality source. I should note that the balance of the band is a little off at the beginning, but quickly adjusts to a satisfactory mix for most of the show. Overall , the bass is a bit weak and the percussion a little too forward for my tastes, but its close enough to not get in the way of really enjoying the music.As for the performance, well, if you don't know why WP was considered such a big deal ,this document should convince you of their importance in modern jazz history. This was before they played the big concert venues and added all the lights and smoke. This is not a show band: this a seriously committed group of players who came to blow the walls off the hall. And blow the walls off they do. Presented with this 'take no prisoners' attitude, even the somewhat restrained Montreux audience is visibly moved to standing applause by the end.This is the Heavy Weather band before Heavy Weather. (But listen: Zawinul was messing around with the Birdland lick at the beginning of ex causa-and isn't that the bass riff from River People that jaco's playing in Gibraltar?)  The material ranges from early Zawinul (ex Causa) through Black Market. The intensity and focus never wavers for an instant, even in the introspective moments. It's fascinating to watch these younger incarnations of the legends we know today.  This younger Zawinul,  whose stage persona is not known to be particularly engaging, is postively (dare I say it?) gleeful at times. He even smiles on several occasions. Wayne is ever the enigmatic poet, rarely coming up for air to peer out at the crowd. This was Jaco Pasorius' second live gig with the band, and he seems to be out to prove himself to the Big Boys. There are no shennanigans and no grand standing on this set-Jaco's not playing to the crowd- he's clearly here to make music.Another delight of this set is the spirited interplay between percussionist Manolo Badrena and drummer Alex Acuna. They smile,cajole and even playfully taunt one another,constantly upping the excitement on stage. They are a pleasure to watch. Their enthusiasm and good natured comradery adds to the overall good vibe of the performance. This band is having fun.I noticed Amazon has lowered the price from the $14 I paid for my copy. Honestly, it would be well worth the price at twice the price. This is a long sought after gem. Don't miss it.Now if only someone would come out with that legendary Belgrade video...",5,Revelation Time,1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,3577,"['many', 'Weather', 'Report', 'fanatics', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'WP', 'live', 'videos', ""'re"", 'already', 'own', 'bootleg', 'show', 'have', 'two', 'second', 'being', 'slightly', 'better', 'quality', 'first', 'even', 'hand', 'held', 'audience', 'camera', 'horrible', 'quality', 'filling', 'Dr', 'Honora', 'ex', 'Causa/Directions', 'tune', 'was', 'missing', 'television', 'broadcast', 'whence', 'bootleg', 'was', 'born.But', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'quality', 'good', 'folks', 'Eagle', 'Vision', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'taking', 'original', 'filmed', 'concert', 'lovingly', 'restoring', 'full', 'length', 'Even', 'more', 'impressive', 'crystal', 'clear', 'video', 'continuity', 'superior', 'sound', 'are', 'given', 'no', 'less', 'three', 'formats', 'choose', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'DTS', 'PCM', 'stereo', 'DTS', 'great', 'system', 'putting', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'aural', 'magnifying', 'glass', 'One', 'can', 'hear', 'so', 'many', 'details', 'first', 'viewing/listening', 'was', 'startling', 'even', 'have', 'viewed', 'bootleg', 'countless', 'times', 'PCM', 'stereo', 'version', 'also', 'superb-encoded', '@', '48k', '16', 'bit', 'CD', 'specs', 'too', 'considering', '1976', 'concert', 'quality', 'source', 'should', 'note', 'balance', 'band', 'little', 'off', 'beginning', 'quickly', 'satisfactory', 'mix', 'most', 'show', 'Overall', 'bass', 'bit', 'weak', 'percussion', 'little', 'too', 'forward', 'tastes', 'close', 'enough', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'really', 'enjoying', 'music.As', 'performance', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'WP', 'was', 'considered', 'big', 'deal', 'document', 'should', 'convince', 'importance', 'modern', 'jazz', 'history', 'was', 'played', 'big', 'concert', 'venues', 'added', 'lights', 'smoke', 'not', 'show', 'band', 'seriously', 'committed', 'group', 'players', 'who', 'came', 'blow', 'walls', 'hall', 'blow', 'walls', 'do', 'Presented', 'prisoners', 'attitude', 'even', 'somewhat', 'restrained', 'Montreux', 'audience', 'visibly', 'moved', 'standing', 'applause', 'end.This', 'Heavy', 'Weather', 'band', 'Heavy', 'Weather', 'Zawinul', 'was', 'messing', 'around', 'Birdland', 'lick', 'beginning', 'ex', 'causa-and', ""n't"", 'bass', 'riff', 'River', 'People', 'jaco', 'playing', 'Gibraltar', 'material', 'early', 'Zawinul', 'ex', 'Causa', 'Black', 'Market', 'intensity', 'focus', 'never', 'wavers', 'instant', 'even', 'introspective', 'moments', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'younger', 'incarnations', 'legends', 'know', 'today', 'younger', 'Zawinul', 'stage', 'persona', 'not', 'known', 'be', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'postively', 'dare', 'say', 'gleeful', 'times', 'even', 'several', 'occasions', 'Wayne', 'ever', 'enigmatic', 'poet', 'rarely', 'coming', 'up', 'air', 'peer', 'out', 'crowd', 'was', 'Jaco', 'Pasorius', 'second', 'live', 'gig', 'band', 'be', 'out', 'prove', 'Big', 'Boys', 'are', 'shennanigans', 'grand', 'standing', 'set-Jaco', 'not', 'playing', 'crowd-', 'clearly', 'here', 'make', 'music.Another', 'delight', 'set', 'spirited', 'interplay', 'percussionist', 'Manolo', 'Badrena', 'drummer', 'Alex', 'Acuna', 'smile', 'cajole', 'even', 'playfully', 'taunt', 'one', 'constantly', 'upping', 'excitement', 'stage', 'are', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'enthusiasm', 'good', 'natured', 'comradery', 'overall', 'good', 'vibe', 'performance', 'band', 'having', 'fun.I', 'noticed', 'Amazon', 'lowered', 'price', '14', 'paid', 'copy', 'Honestly', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'price', 'twice', 'price', 'long', 'sought', 'gem', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'it.Now', 'only', 'someone', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'legendary', 'Belgrade', 'video']",N/A

Many WR fans have had this one from their bootleg collection and it ranks up there with one of their favorites.  The Montreux Jazz Fest and Mr. Claude have done a wonderful job in restoring these historical concerts.  Why have I seen this show over hundreds of times and still left shaking my head in disbelief. I hear that they are going to release the Mahavishnu 1974 show as well as the 84 band.  I say bring them on all of them (even Stanley Clarke 1980), because Sony (baloney) aint doin a thing.  In this particular show Shorter is the star, his solo on Black Market is mesmerizing as well as on Pastorius's Barbary Coast. Shorter is one of the best improvisers of all time, and here he is given so much space to play.  Jaco actually was playing in the band for 3 or 4 months and he is killer all the way through.  I wish this remastered version would have shown more camera angles with him playing, because he is spectacular.  Nobody sounded like him at that time and no one sounded like the wizard Joe Zawinul on synths.  Joe Zawinul is Weather Report!!! One of my favorite moments is when Jaco gets into the River People rift on Gilbraltar and you can see Zawinul start to hold in his drool from his mouth because it sounds so good.  Then they take it to another level when Wayne comes in and they freak the music into another dimension.  It's also great to see Joe and Jaco stare each other down, because it's a beautiful competitive collaborative effort.  With this concert I can see why Jaco choose Alex Acuna on drums instead of Chester Thomas because they fit so well.  This 76 show is better than the 78 Germany on Forecast Tomorrow in so many ways.  I agree with fellow fans to release more Weather Report shows live because it was an event like no other.  I wish the human race will be able to see the Belgrade show from 1980, because they go cosmic.  But according to the Forecast Tomorrow booklet the master tape of that show was probably destroyed in 1999.  Hopefully we can wish that it isn't and will see the light of day.  Maybe Bill Graham's Wolfgang vault will release a show if they have any.

940072,A2K3UTNW0783U6,B000BC8SVK,Phillip Kay,"[7, 8]","Last night I watched a DVD of a Nina Simone concert and I learned a thing or two about her I didn't know before.I first discovered Nina Simone about 20 years ago ' ever since she's been one of my icons. I get shivers up my spine whenever I listened to her sing Dylan's Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues or Leonard Cohen's Suzanne.  I explored the incredible diversity of her repertoire. I loved that she could handle anything ' show music, children's songs, folk music, pop anthems, jazz standards, protest songs ' and make whatever she sang a Nina Simone song. I loved her voice. I saw the tail end of her career, and her impact was often diminished by poor recordings ' sadly, her voice gave out in the end.Back in 1976 Nina Simone was 43. She's filmed in closeup throughout the concert. I could see an incredibly charismatic, powerfully emotional personality, and that she was a very beautiful woman, even in her 40s. Here was an intelligent woman who thought about her emotions and the world she lived in. There seemed a lot going on inside her and only a small portion of it was expressed.Nina talked to the audience about some of the things in her mind. Then, abruptly, she sat down and played the piano. At some stage she said, I'm a pianist, the singing was just an accident, something she's often said. She played some of the best piano I've ever heard. She played rhythm section on the bass keys while the drummer showed off, she played improvisational jazz chords, she played powerful classical crescendos. Nina played piano with a range and flair that I think few other pianists could match. She held the show together effortlessly with her piano, with only a percussionist to support her, and the sound was flawlessly recorded. I realised that a lot of her studio work has featured her vocal and that her backing combo has often not featured her piano, which seems more in evidence in her live recordings. Throughout the concert I got the feeling I was just seeing the tip of the iceberg, that she was capable of far more.The audience loved her but they did not give her her due. She was just back from her residence in Liberia and I thought she seemed to want an African response, the rhythm clapped in unison, the chorus chanted in point and counterpoint. She got instead a fairly staid and sporadic applause, the faces in the crowd mostly expressionless. The men had long hair and beards, someone was smoking a joint (1976, right!) yet they looked conservative. Someone yelled at her for talking too much and asked her to start singing a song. I thought this might be why she was such an emotionally powerful performer, because she had never connected emotionally to her satisfaction with people in her personal life.There were only six songs in the '76 set: Little Girl Blue; Backlash Blues; Be My Husband; I Wish I Knew (How It Would Feel to be Free); Stars / Feelings; African Mailman. Nina was a little high on the night, she was just back from Africa, she'd spent time with her daughter, she was bitter about what was happening in America. Whatever. I have rarely heard such devastating emotion in a singer's delivery. Whatever was happening in Nina's life, happiness, torment, fear, despair ' or all of them mixed together, it was in her tones as she sang. When I say Nina Simone was an emotionally powerful performer I don't just mean that she felt powerfully. She harnessed her feeling to an incredibly skilled vocal and musical performance, and that takes a discipline that few people are capable of.The DVD includes some tracks from Nina's performances at Montreux in 1987 and 1990. Nina was 54 and 57, grown somewhat portly and much more self contained. She now had a band behind her, stays behind her piano, engages a lot less with the audience and does more of a self consciously 'entertainment act'. You'll enjoy the music: Someone to Watch Over Me; My Baby Just Cares For Me; I Loves You Porgy; Liberian Calypso; Four Women / Mississippi Goddam; Ne Me Quitte Pas (Don't Leave Me). But if you've not seen them before, you'll never forget the '76 versions of I Wish I Knew and Stars/Feelings.Someone like this doesn't happen very often.",5,A star like no other,1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,4159,"['Last', 'night', 'watched', 'DVD', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'concert', 'learned', 'thing', 'two', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'before.I', 'first', 'discovered', 'Nina', 'Simone', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'ever', 'been', 'one', 'icons', 'get', 'shivers', 'up', 'spine', 'whenever', 'listened', 'sing', 'Dylan', 'Just', 'Tom', 'Thumb', 'Blues', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'Suzanne', 'explored', 'incredible', 'diversity', 'repertoire', 'loved', 'could', 'handle', 'anything', 'show', 'music', 'children', 'songs', 'folk', 'music', 'pop', 'anthems', 'jazz', 'standards', 'protest', 'songs', 'make', 'sang', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'song', 'loved', 'voice', 'saw', 'tail', 'end', 'career', 'impact', 'was', 'often', 'diminished', 'poor', 'recordings', 'sadly', 'voice', 'gave', 'out', 'end.Back', '1976', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'was', '43', 'filmed', 'closeup', 'concert', 'could', 'see', 'incredibly', 'charismatic', 'powerfully', 'emotional', 'personality', 'was', 'very', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'even', '40s', 'Here', 'was', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'who', 'thought', 'emotions', 'world', 'lived', 'seemed', 'lot', 'going', 'only', 'small', 'portion', 'was', 'expressed.Nina', 'talked', 'audience', 'things', 'mind', 'Then', 'abruptly', 'sat', 'down', 'played', 'piano', 'stage', 'said', ""'m"", 'pianist', 'singing', 'was', 'just', 'accident', 'something', 'often', 'said', 'played', 'best', 'piano', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'played', 'rhythm', 'section', 'bass', 'keys', 'drummer', 'showed', 'played', 'improvisational', 'jazz', 'chords', 'played', 'powerful', 'classical', 'crescendos', 'Nina', 'played', 'piano', 'range', 'flair', 'think', 'few', 'other', 'pianists', 'could', 'match', 'held', 'show', 'together', 'effortlessly', 'piano', 'only', 'percussionist', 'support', 'sound', 'was', 'flawlessly', 'recorded', 'realised', 'lot', 'studio', 'work', 'featured', 'vocal', 'backing', 'combo', 'often', 'not', 'featured', 'piano', 'more', 'evidence', 'live', 'recordings', 'concert', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', 'just', 'seeing', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'was', 'capable', 'far', 'more.The', 'audience', 'loved', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'due', 'was', 'just', 'back', 'residence', 'Liberia', 'thought', 'seemed', 'want', 'African', 'response', 'rhythm', 'clapped', 'unison', 'chorus', 'chanted', 'point', 'counterpoint', 'got', 'instead', 'fairly', 'staid', 'sporadic', 'applause', 'crowd', 'mostly', 'expressionless', 'men', 'had', 'long', 'hair', 'beards', 'someone', 'was', 'smoking', 'joint', '1976', 'right', 'yet', 'looked', 'conservative', 'Someone', 'yelled', 'talking', 'too', 'much', 'asked', 'start', 'singing', 'song', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'why', 'was', 'such', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'performer', 'had', 'never', 'connected', 'emotionally', 'satisfaction', 'people', 'personal', 'life.There', 'were', 'only', 'six', 'songs', ""'76"", 'set', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Blue', 'Backlash', 'Blues', 'Be', 'My', 'Husband', 'Wish', 'Knew', 'How', 'Would', 'Feel', 'be', 'Free', 'Stars', '/', 'Feelings', 'African', 'Mailman', 'Nina', 'was', 'little', 'high', 'night', 'was', 'just', 'back', 'Africa', ""'d"", 'spent', 'time', 'daughter', 'was', 'bitter', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'America', 'have', 'rarely', 'heard', 'such', 'devastating', 'emotion', 'singer', 'delivery', 'was', 'happening', 'Nina', 'life', 'happiness', 'torment', 'fear', 'despair', 'mixed', 'together', 'was', 'tones', 'sang', 'When', 'say', 'Nina', 'Simone', 'was', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'performer', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'mean', 'felt', 'powerfully', 'harnessed', 'feeling', 'incredibly', 'skilled', 'vocal', 'musical', 'performance', 'discipline', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'capable', 'of.The', 'DVD', 'tracks', 'Nina', 'performances', 'Montreux', '1987', '1990', 'Nina', 'was', '54', '57', 'grown', 'somewhat', 'portly', 'much', 'more', 'self', 'contained', 'now', 'had', 'band', 'piano', 'lot', 'less', 'audience', 'more', 'self', 'consciously', ""'entertainment"", 'act', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'music', 'Someone', 'Watch', 'Me', 'My', 'Baby', 'Just', 'Cares', 'Me', 'Loves', 'Porgy', 'Liberian', 'Calypso', 'Four', 'Women', '/', 'Mississippi', 'Goddam', 'Ne', 'Me', 'Quitte', 'Pas', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Leave', 'Me', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', ""'76"", 'versions', 'Wish', 'Knew', 'Stars/Feelings.Someone', ""n't"", 'happen', 'very', 'often']",N/A

However when you see what they do with Stevie Wonder's ""Signed Sealed Delivered I'm Yours"" you'll wonder why anybody needs singers!",5,Classic Stuff,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,978,"['group', 'consisted', 'finest', 'New', 'York', 'session', 'men', 'who', 'played', 'multitude', 'recordings', 'perhaps', 'most', 'famously', 'were', 'core', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'backing', 'band', 'mid', '70s', '80s', 'set', 'title', 'live', 'Montreux', '1976.The', 'line-up', 'Steve', 'Gadd', 'DrumsGordon', 'Edwards', 'BassRichard', 'Tee', 'KeyboardsCornell', 'Dupree', 'GuitarEric', 'Gale', 'GuitarSadly', 'Richard', 'tee', 'Eric', 'Gale', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'However', 'DVD', 'great', 'talent', 'guys', 'were', 'masters', 'groove', 'Anybody', 'who', 'Steve', 'Gadd', 'will', 'know', 'perfect', 'band', 'lock', 'groove', 'so', 'will', 'fabulous', 'Gospel', 'Piano', 'playing', 'Richard', 'Tee', 'one', 'drum', 'solo', 'Steve', 'Gadd', 'guest', 'singer', 'appear', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'realise', 'essentially', 'instrumental', 'band', 'However', 'when', 'see', 'what', 'do', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Signed', 'Sealed', 'Delivered', ""'m"", ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'why', 'anybody', 'singers']",N/A

After all these decades gone by, I realized I had never had the chance to see her in person, or on film. So, I took a chance and bought this dvd.When I get on a music kick, I buy a lot of concert dvds. Think I bought 25 of um this month.Anyway, I was just going to check out the sound and picture quality of this dvd, ya know, maybe catch a tune or two, then go on to the others that came in the mail.No way! I sat there, completely spellbound. The 1976 Montreux Concert, as others have mentioned, is an experience that defies description. Her stage persona was like no other. She can put a spell on you, and leave you absolutely riveted to her every phrase. The close-up camera work, only adds to the effect.I dont know what else to say, because...there are no words.Experience this performance soon.",5,Absolutely mesmerizing!,1256169600,"10 22, 2009",2009,890,"['had', 'Loves', 'Porgy', 'Nina', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Think', 'was', 'Bethlehem', 'Label', 'decades', 'gone', 'realized', 'had', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'person', 'film', 'So', 'took', 'chance', 'bought', 'dvd.When', 'get', 'music', 'kick', 'buy', 'lot', 'concert', 'dvds', 'Think', 'bought', '25', 'um', 'month.Anyway', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'check', 'out', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'dvd', 'ya', 'know', 'maybe', 'catch', 'tune', 'two', 'then', 'go', 'others', 'came', 'mail.No', 'way', 'sat', 'there', 'completely', 'spellbound', '1976', 'Montreux', 'Concert', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'experience', 'description', 'stage', 'persona', 'was', 'other', 'can', 'put', 'spell', 'leave', 'absolutely', 'riveted', 'phrase', 'close-up', 'camera', 'work', 'only', 'effect.I', 'dont', 'know', 'what', 'else', 'say', 'are', 'words.Experience', 'performance', 'soon']",N/A

All the songs are excellent, video is clear  and music is tight. Alex Acuna is awesome.  The talk of not enough Jaco is crazy. After all he was just a part of the band--all members seemed to be shown equally.  If I had to say anything negative about it would be that Joe Zawinul's pants are too tight---but that's just the nature of the decade it was!!
