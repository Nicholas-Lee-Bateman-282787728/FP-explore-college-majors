1546390,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B00858MY5S,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[16, 16]","I have to confess, right away, that I am a fan of Bruce Lee, and have been one since the seventies, when he conquered the world with ""Enter the Dragon,"" the film that made him a megastar - a short-lived one, since he unbelievably died early at the age of 32. And, as a fan that I am of Bruce, I have seen almost every documentary available about his life (and death). With that said, I can affirm that ""I am Bruce Lee"" is the best and most complete documentary about him ever made. This is the real thing.Approved by Bruce Lee Enterprises, the documentary has lots of participation from Linda Lee Cadwell -- Lee's widow -, as well as daughter Shannon. It also has interviews with Lee's closest, known friends and disciples, such as Dan Inosanto, Richard Bustillo, and Bob Wall. There are interviews with some celebrities that were influenced by Lee, including Ed O'Neill, Mickey Rourke, Manny Pacquiao, Reginald Hudlin, Ray Mancini, Kobe Bryant, Diana Lee Inosanto, Gina Carano, Jon Jones, and others.The film really covers almost every aspect of Lee's life by way of interviews or archival footage, including the classic interview at the Pierre Berton show in 1971; his early movies as a child actor; his first martial arts school in Seattle - Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute; Ed Parker's International World Karate Championships in Long Beach, California; his troubles with the Chinese community for teaching to non-Chinese people in Seattle; the birth of Jeet Kune do; the effect of the Manson murders on his life; his death in Hong Kong; and much more. Of course, there is plenty of information about his TV and film career, including the ""Green Hornet;"" being teacher of such Hollywood luminaries as James Coburn, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Steve McQueen, etc.; his films ""The Big Boss,"" ""Fist of Fury,"" ""The Way of the Dragon,"" ""Game of Death,"" and ""Enter the Dragon;"" and, of course, his project ""The Silent Flute,"" which was never done, as well as ""The Warrior,"" later was renamed ""Kung Fu,"" a role that went instead to David Carradine.""I am Bruce Lee"" is it, believe me. This is the documentary on the master that we were waiting for, authorized by his family, and with never-before-seen material. The Blu-ray also includes Bruce Lee personal videos training and teaching the movie stars at his patio, his global impact, his Hollywood audition, and more. (USA, 2012, color and B&W;, 94 min plus additional material).Reviewed on January 8, 2012 by Eric Gonzales for Shout Factory Blu-ray",5,I am Bruce Lee,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,2483,"['have', 'confess', 'right', 'away', 'am', 'fan', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'seventies', 'when', 'conquered', 'world', 'Enter', 'Dragon', 'film', 'made', 'megastar', 'short-lived', 'one', 'unbelievably', 'died', 'early', 'age', '32', 'fan', 'am', 'Bruce', 'have', 'seen', 'almost', 'documentary', 'available', 'life', 'death', 'said', 'can', 'affirm', 'am', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'best', 'most', 'complete', 'documentary', 'ever', 'made', 'real', 'thing.Approved', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Enterprises', 'documentary', 'lots', 'participation', 'Linda', 'Lee', 'Cadwell', 'Lee', 'widow', 'as', 'well', 'daughter', 'Shannon', 'also', 'interviews', 'Lee', 'closest', 'known', 'friends', 'disciples', 'such', 'Dan', 'Inosanto', 'Richard', 'Bustillo', 'Bob', 'Wall', 'are', 'interviews', 'celebrities', 'were', 'influenced', 'Lee', 'including', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Manny', 'Pacquiao', 'Reginald', 'Hudlin', 'Ray', 'Mancini', 'Kobe', 'Bryant', 'Diana', 'Lee', 'Inosanto', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'Jon', 'Jones', 'others.The', 'film', 'really', 'almost', 'aspect', 'Lee', 'life', 'way', 'interviews', 'archival', 'footage', 'including', 'classic', 'interview', 'Pierre', 'Berton', 'show', '1971', 'early', 'movies', 'child', 'actor', 'first', 'martial', 'arts', 'school', 'Seattle', 'Jun', 'Fan', 'Gung', 'Fu', 'Institute', 'Ed', 'Parker', 'International', 'World', 'Karate', 'Championships', 'Long', 'Beach', 'California', 'troubles', 'Chinese', 'community', 'teaching', 'non-Chinese', 'people', 'Seattle', 'birth', 'Jeet', 'Kune', 'do', 'effect', 'Manson', 'murders', 'life', 'death', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'much', 'more', 'course', 'plenty', 'information', 'TV', 'film', 'career', 'including', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'being', 'teacher', 'such', 'Hollywood', 'luminaries', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Kareem', 'Abdul-Jabbar', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'etc', 'films', 'Big', 'Boss', 'Fist', 'Fury', 'Way', 'Dragon', 'Game', 'Death', 'Enter', 'Dragon', 'course', 'project', 'Silent', 'Flute', 'was', 'never', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'Warrior', 'later', 'was', 'renamed', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'role', 'went', 'instead', 'David', 'Carradine', 'am', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'believe', 'documentary', 'master', 'were', 'waiting', 'authorized', 'family', 'never-before-seen', 'material', 'Blu-ray', 'also', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'personal', 'videos', 'training', 'teaching', 'movie', 'patio', 'global', 'impact', 'Hollywood', 'audition', 'more', 'USA', '2012', 'color', 'B', 'W', '94', 'min', 'additional', 'material', '.Reviewed', 'January', '8', '2012', 'Eric', 'Gonzales', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'Blu-ray']",I Am Bruce Lee
1546391,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00858MY5S,C. Sawin,"[28, 34]","Nearly 40 years after his death and after countless Bruceploitation films in the 70s, a biographical film in the early 90s, two documentaries that were made nearly ten years apart, a biographical TV series, and another biographical film in 2010, it's safe to say that the legacy of Bruce Lee is pretty much covered. Nevertheless a new documentary entitled ""I Am Bruce Lee"" is upon us with the promise of ""never before seen footage"" and that it's ""the best Bruce Lee documentary ever!"" While its ""unmissable"" content may be up for debate, ""I Am Bruce Lee"" is an interesting insight into Bruce Lee's life, but features material that can otherwise be found in any other documentary or biographical film based on his life.The documentary utilizes this rather irritating editing technique where it jumps back and forth between family, friends, trainers, actors, MMA fighters, and boxers talking about how Bruce Lee has affected their lives and footage from Bruce Lee's films, his personal films from backyard training, or family photos. That doesn't sound so bad, but when you have to listen to what sounds like a flat palm slapping the surface of a wet watermelon every few seconds along with Bruce Lee's signature ""WAAAAAA!"" or ""WAAATAAAAA!"" then it gets extremely tiresome really quickly.Some of the people they choose to do interviews with is rather questionable. Hearing from the likes of Linda Lee Cadwell, Shannon Lee, Dan Inosanto, and Diana Lee Inosanto is mandatory because they all knew Bruce so well. Hearing from historians, authors and even UFC president Dana White is also very interesting. White actually comes across as very intelligent and knowledgeable and according to White Bruce Lee is the ""father"" of UFC. Learning that Ed O'Neill is not only a Bruce Lee enthusiast but also a black belt was a neat fact. While the movie isn't rated, the entire documentary seemed to be more lenient with vulgarity solely for the sake of Mickey Rourke who drops the F-bomb nearly every time he's on screen. Hearing from professional dancer Jose Ruiz III and Black Eyed Peas member Taboo just makes you roll your eyes. Do you really care that Taboo stands a certain way when he sings because of Bruce Lee? Meanwhile Jose's take on Bruce's philosophy and what it means to him is just a joke. Then there's retired UFC fighter Stephen Bonnar who just comes off as this huge meathead whenever he opens his mouth or the current UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones who claims that he's enlightening his opponents whenever he beats the snot out of them. It just seems ridiculous to hear from Manny Pacquiao who likes to comb his hair like Bruce's when we could hear from Jackie Chan, Chuck Norris, John Saxon, Jim Kelly, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, or even Sammo Hung or Donnie Yen and have it actually mean something.During its 94-minute runtime, ""I Am Bruce Lee"" covers Bruce's entire life from being raised in Hong Kong to his untimely passing in 1973. What's most interesting is learning that Bruce was a Cha Cha dancing champion, but having everything laid out in front of you (his move to the US when he was 18, the troubles of interracial marriage, his training with Yip Man, his time on ""The Green Hornet,"" developing Jeet Kune Do and its evolution, MMA, recovering from his back injury in 1970, the decision to go back to Hong Kong to get his career in movies running, and his rise in popularity) is always something that's worth watching. The documentary uses a lot of footage from Bruce's lost interview with Pierre Berton in 1971, which is always a great watch. It's also surprising that they go into so much detail about Bruce's death (how he was supposedly poisoned, the aneurysm, the Lee family curse, etc) as they've always seemed to barely brush on the subject in the past. It's also touching to see everyone that was close to Bruce still get choked up and still almost be brought to tears whenever the subject of his passing is brought up.The rarest aspect of the documentary is seeing Bruce's training videos from his own backyard with the likes of James Coburn, Steve McQueen, Dan Inosanto, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and seeing a young Brandon Lee and Diana Lee Inosanto play in the background. Seeing the footage from his demonstration of his two finger pushup and one-inch punch is also quite a treat, but not exactly rare.Bring up Bruce Lee and just about everyone respects his work and thinks ""Enter the Dragon"" is one of the greatest action films of all time or remembers when he was Kato on ""The Green Hornet,"" but the thought process that always seems to come up whenever one of these documentaries is released is just how incredible Bruce's philosophy was. Not only that but it also seems to gain more meaning as time passes. Just think of what this man could've accomplished not only in Hollywood but in the physical world as well if he had lived all this time and been around long enough to see the ripe old age of 72.There is some enjoyment to be had with ""I Am Bruce Lee,"" but its manic editing style, absurd choice of individuals to be interviewed for the documentary, and a sense of redundancy over the amount of footage and information you've already seen and have knowledge of being used over and over again knocks ""I Am Bruce Lee"" way over into the completely unnecessary category. ""Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey"" had quality information and all of the footage Bruce shot for ""Game of Death"" embedded in its core while ""How Bruce Lee Changed the World"" had a better cast of people being interviewed. It's safe to say that every inch of Bruce Lee's legacy has been covered and ""I Am Bruce Lee"" is just an excessive amount of icing added to an already well decorated cake.Special features on the Blu-ray include the 11.5-minute featurette ""Backyard Training - Bruce Lee's Personal Films,"" the 3-minute ""Inspiration - Bruce Lee's Global Impact,"" the nearly 5-minute ""Bruce Lee in Action"" which covers all of Bruce's films except for ""Enter the Dragon,"" the theatrical trailer for the movie, and ""Bruce Lee's Hollywood Audition.""",2,An informative but otherwise disposable

There are other good documentaries out there on Bruce Lee, but it's that this one is different from the others and very well made with all the interviews and stories.  It goes with a time line on his life from his youth to his end. I really enjoyed the bonus features. Including his Hollywood audition in full, backyard training from his personal films, inspiration-global impact, a short summary of his action films and theatrical trailer. This dvd is like you were hanging out at a Bruce Lee remembrance get together and everyone was telling their own stories on how he impacted their lives while watching footage on him at the same time.

Unfortunately .... its just another version of the already availableHow Bruce Lee Changed the Worldand the documentaryBruce Lee - A Warrior's Journey.  I am happy to own them all and am glad I own this but I can't honestly say that anything in it created an ""ah ha"" moment for me. Lots of current day ""talking heads"" with the same clips from his very iconic films scattered throughout. Most of the bonus content is also available as bonus content on the spectacular 2 DVD set or BR set of Enter The Dragon....as well as the documentary previously mentioned ""A Warriors Journey""Bottom line...If you don't know about Bruce Lee but are interested ...getEnter the Dragon (Two-Disc Special Edition)or the Blu Ray version... its a terrific film with hours of bonus content.  IF ... you have everything (as I am guilty of) complete your collection with this but expect the same content arranged slightly differently.Other reviewers have commented on the content... basically his story told through people who knew him or are inspired by him with his voice and clips interjected. There isn't any new film to discover of Mr Lee so at this point all we can expect and what this delivers is moving the existing furniture to create a different vibe.",3,don't expect anything new.... but its nice to have on BR,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,1444,"['was', 'very', 'excited', 'doc', 'two', 'reasons', 'love', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'director', 'Pete', 'McCormack', 'who', 'made', 'amazingly', 'fresh', 'insightful', 'documentary', 'Facing', 'Ali', 'Facing', 'Aliso', 'had', 'going', 'Unfortunately', 'just', 'version', 'already', 'availableHow', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Changed', 'Worldand', 'documentaryBruce', 'Lee', 'Warrior', 'Journey', 'am', 'happy', 'own', 'am', 'glad', 'own', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'say', 'anything', 'created', 'ah', 'ha', 'moment', 'Lots', 'current', 'day', 'talking', 'heads', 'same', 'clips', 'very', 'iconic', 'films', 'scattered', 'Most', 'bonus', 'content', 'also', 'available', 'bonus', 'content', 'spectacular', '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'BR', 'set', 'Enter', 'Dragon', '.as', 'well', 'documentary', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'A', 'Warriors', 'Journey', 'Bottom', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'are', 'interested', 'getEnter', 'Dragon', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'terrific', 'film', 'hours', 'bonus', 'content', 'IF', 'have', 'everything', 'am', 'guilty', 'complete', 'collection', 'expect', 'same', 'content', 'arranged', 'slightly', 'differently.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'content', 'basically', 'story', 'told', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'are', 'inspired', 'voice', 'clips', 'interjected', ""n't"", 'new', 'film', 'discover', 'Mr', 'Lee', 'so', 'point', 'can', 'expect', 'what', 'moving', 'existing', 'furniture', 'create', 'different', 'vibe']",I Am Bruce Lee

It says english not contonese, I wasn't being nasty I didn't curse at all. In my comments reguarding the Bruce Lee, 7 blu-ray and dvd box set. I wrote in respose to a dissatisfied customer, because I was gonna buy this box set. So when I read his review, I decided that I wasn't gonna purchase this. If a lot of english speaking customers, bought this box set. And play it and the actors were speaking contonese, how angry do you think they would be. And I'm not taking about, the track settings you can set. For the subtitles that will appear, at the bottom of the screen. That you would have to read threw out the whole movie, would you want to sit. Threw out a movie and read subtitles when you can hear,the subtiltes are for ppl who can't hear. My comments are so customer won't waste their money, because I won't be one of them. I've purchase lots electronic's dvd's and blu-ray movies and been totally satisfed. I would never ever blame Amazon for, purchasing a box set that wasn't in english speaking language. But were in canonese speaking language, because I know Allison that some or most of their shipment comes from overseas. That's why! when I checked on Amazon's UK site first, in 20ll they had it in four different. Foregin lanuages and english was not one of them, but it had engish subtitles. If I had decided to purchase it from the UK Amazon, I would have regretted it. That why! I read the product details, and it didn't say engish only the 5.1. Subtitle reading words you would have to read, at the bottom of the screen threw out the movie. So Allison I thank myself for reading a customers review, for being the reason I did puschase this off the USA Amazon site this year. I feel Amazon should make customers aware, before they purchase this Bruce Lee 7 box collection set. That it is not in english speaking language, that it's only has english subtiltes setting tracks. So when you play tha dvd, you can read subtitles threw out. Each and every dvd or blu-ray, but I don't think they will do it. Because they are trying to make money, not lose money so if the customer's don't know it wouldn't matter. But me typing this review, for the engish speaking Bruce Lee fans like me who! watched all his movies, back in the early 70's. Bruce Lee was speaking in english on american movie screen, threw out the USA. And differnt languages in other countries, customer's please! when you purchase any type of asian movie or box set. Read the product detail below the picture, and read other customer reviews. Because it can be very helpful, that way you won't be wasting your money. I don't this my long review is being nasty in anykind of way, as Allison was teling the customer's that I was. People value other customer's reviews, when it comes down to a product.
