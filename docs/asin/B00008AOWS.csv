The Doctor and Leela land on a spacecraft carrying the survivors of the ancient Minyan race on a 100,000-year quest to recover their ""race banks"" from the P7E, a ship that left their home planet millennia ago.For viewers a little sketchy on their classics, this disc includes ""Into the Unknown,"" a mini-documentary in the Special Features menu that spells out in detail all the parallels between ""Underworld"" and Jason and the Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece, as well as the many technical challenges the show had to overcome to be delivered on time and under budget.""Underworld"" made extensive use of ""color separation overlay,"" or CSO, technology to create scenery that would otherwise have been prohibitively expensive to build. This, of course, required the actors to perform complicated scenes in an empty studio covered in blue fabric for some 30 minutes of the story's 89 minutes of airtime. The show's designers also made double use of the set for the Minyan spacecraft, converting it into the lost P7E when needed. Meanwhile, laser effects had to be painstakingly added to fight scenes.""Underworld"" was a remarkable achievement for its time, a rip-roaring action adventure with fantastic costume designs and cutting-edge effects at the dawn of the Star Wars era.",4,Doctor Who meets Jason and the Argonauts,1292889600,"12 21, 2010",2010,1459,"['Other', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'draw', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'none', 'so', 'elaborately', 'comprehensively', 'Underworld', 'science-fictional', 'retelling', 'story', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'Doctor', 'Leela', 'land', 'spacecraft', 'carrying', 'survivors', 'ancient', 'Minyan', 'race', '100,000-year', 'quest', 'recover', 'race', 'banks', 'P7E', 'ship', 'left', 'home', 'planet', 'millennia', 'ago.For', 'viewers', 'little', 'sketchy', 'classics', 'disc', 'Unknown', 'mini-documentary', 'Special', 'Features', 'menu', 'out', 'detail', 'parallels', 'Underworld', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'quest', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'technical', 'challenges', 'show', 'had', 'overcome', 'be', 'delivered', 'time', 'budget', 'Underworld', 'made', 'extensive', 'use', 'color', 'separation', 'overlay', 'CSO', 'technology', 'create', 'scenery', 'would', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'prohibitively', 'expensive', 'build', 'course', 'required', 'actors', 'perform', 'complicated', 'scenes', 'empty', 'studio', 'covered', 'blue', 'fabric', '30', 'minutes', 'story', '89', 'minutes', 'airtime', 'show', 'designers', 'also', 'made', 'double', 'use', 'set', 'Minyan', 'spacecraft', 'converting', 'lost', 'P7E', 'when', 'needed', 'Meanwhile', 'laser', 'effects', 'had', 'be', 'painstakingly', 'added', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Underworld', 'was', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'time', 'rip-roaring', 'action', 'adventure', 'fantastic', 'costume', 'designs', 'cutting-edge', 'effects', 'dawn', 'Star', 'Wars', 'era']",N/A

""Underworld"" is one of them. Giving us the explanation of the Time Lords' noninvervention with other peoples and planets. That's the interesting bit. The rest is a mix of sloppy extras acting, repeated scenes of guards walking and running up and down and some bad CSO that hadn't been seen since the Pertwee era. There's a neat premise with the Minyons looking for their long lost race bank so their culture and people won't disappear. Their race bank is hidden in the middle of the newly born planet protected by the insane computer, the Oracle. Sounds decent, but it just moves at a snail pace.

Over the years alot of people have complained about the production values(it was shot almost entirely using CSO), and they also gripe about the plot being too close to ""Face of Evil."" So I watched it expecting it not to hold up, and you know what? It's still pretty damn good! Tom Baker is in his prime here, and so is Louise Jameson as Leela. The supporting players are very good here too. The story is loosely based on ""Jason and the Argonauts."" I very much agree with the Doctor Who writter's that Greek mythology is very rich source of inspiration. It is also a bit more fast paced than most 70's Who. There is a great documentary about how they made this story under impossible odds.

737732,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B00008AOWS,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[38, 39]","I hadn't seen this episode since the mid-80s, so I was pretty eager to lay my hands on it when I discovered the BBC was finally going to put it out on VHS after a slight delay of, oh, 28 years. The few fan reviews I had read were pretty harsh, and my own memories of the episode were very few, but I kept an open mind when I popped the tape in.My first impression was that this episode had been done a great wrong. It was witty and seemed to have a mysterious and inventive premise. By the time I was finished watching, though, my main feeling was that this was a classic case of a ""what might have been"" story. Had it been directed by someone who knew how to use close-ups, had the cliffhangers been properly done instead of just happening with the abruptness of a guillotine, had the producers not elected to save a few quid by using horribly fake blue screen backgrounds of the caves instead of going on location as they did for ""Revenge of the Cybermen,"" and had they actually done a second draft on the story, this could have been a real classic. Instead, we have an entertaining but cliche-ridden mess, that takes way too long to move the storyline, stumbles around the plot holes, and then wraps up so fast you have a feeling they forgot to shoot 20 or so minutes of the episode. Call it ""enjoyable mediocrity.""The plot has some nice window dressings that conceal a familiar story. Basically, the doctor must battle a demented computer which thinks it is a god, free a bunch of slaves from servitude, re-unite two branches of a race which diverged 100,000 years ago, and try to make amends for being indirectly responsible for the whole mess to begin with. This story was told previously, and much better, in ""Face of Evil"", and would be told again in ""State of Decay."" There are other self-plagarisms as well, and to get around these, the writers decided that it would be a good idea to simply not explain a lot of what happens. This works for David Lynch fans, but not for me: they should have added an extra episode, done a re-write and fleshed out what needed to be fleshed, instead of just cobbling this thing together. I'd tell the boys how I felt, but oh yeah, this was shot in 1975. I forgot time machines aren't real. What a nerd!So now you are thinking I hated it. No, I just had to vent. It is fun, particularly the first two episodes. The villain costumes are creepy, those shield-guns are cool, and the idea of planets forming around stranded ships, the computers becoming the gods of the crews, and the crews eventually turning into slaves of the computers is a fun concept, however many times it has been tried before (and again!). Overall, it is not an episode I would recommend to buy unless you are a hard-core fan, but if you aren't a hard-core fan, why the hell are you reading this?",3,The quest is the quest,1053043200,"05 16, 2003",2003,2810,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'episode', 'mid-80s', 'was', 'pretty', 'eager', 'lay', 'hands', 'when', 'discovered', 'BBC', 'was', 'finally', 'going', 'put', 'out', 'VHS', 'slight', 'delay', 'oh', '28', 'years', 'few', 'fan', 'reviews', 'had', 'read', 'were', 'pretty', 'harsh', 'own', 'memories', 'episode', 'were', 'very', 'few', 'kept', 'open', 'mind', 'when', 'popped', 'tape', 'in.My', 'first', 'impression', 'was', 'episode', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'great', 'wrong', 'was', 'witty', 'seemed', 'have', 'mysterious', 'inventive', 'premise', 'time', 'was', 'finished', 'watching', 'though', 'main', 'feeling', 'was', 'was', 'classic', 'case', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'story', 'Had', 'been', 'directed', 'someone', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'use', 'close-ups', 'had', 'cliffhangers', 'been', 'properly', 'done', 'instead', 'just', 'happening', 'abruptness', 'guillotine', 'had', 'producers', 'not', 'elected', 'save', 'few', 'quid', 'using', 'horribly', 'fake', 'blue', 'screen', 'backgrounds', 'caves', 'instead', 'going', 'location', 'did', 'Revenge', 'Cybermen', 'had', 'actually', 'done', 'second', 'draft', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'classic', 'Instead', 'have', 'entertaining', 'cliche-ridden', 'mess', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'move', 'storyline', 'plot', 'holes', 'then', 'wraps', 'up', 'so', 'fast', 'have', 'feeling', 'forgot', 'shoot', '20', 'so', 'minutes', 'episode', 'Call', 'enjoyable', 'mediocrity', 'plot', 'nice', 'window', 'dressings', 'conceal', 'familiar', 'story', 'Basically', 'doctor', 'must', 'battle', 'demented', 'computer', 'god', 'free', 'bunch', 'slaves', 'servitude', 're-unite', 'two', 'branches', 'race', 'diverged', '100,000', 'years', 'ago', 'try', 'make', 'amends', 'being', 'indirectly', 'responsible', 'whole', 'mess', 'begin', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'previously', 'much', 'better', 'Face', 'Evil', 'would', 'be', 'told', 'again', 'State', 'Decay', 'are', 'other', 'self-plagarisms', 'well', 'get', 'writers', 'decided', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'simply', 'not', 'explain', 'lot', 'what', 'David', 'Lynch', 'fans', 'not', 'should', 'have', 'added', 'extra', 'episode', 'done', 're-write', 'fleshed', 'out', 'what', 'needed', 'be', 'fleshed', 'instead', 'just', 'cobbling', 'thing', 'together', ""'d"", 'tell', 'boys', 'how', 'felt', 'oh', 'yeah', 'was', 'shot', '1975', 'forgot', 'time', 'machines', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'What', 'nerd', 'So', 'now', 'are', 'thinking', 'hated', 'No', 'just', 'had', 'vent', 'fun', 'particularly', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'villain', 'costumes', 'are', 'creepy', 'shield-guns', 'are', 'cool', 'idea', 'planets', 'forming', 'around', 'stranded', 'ships', 'computers', 'becoming', 'gods', 'crews', 'crews', 'eventually', 'turning', 'slaves', 'computers', 'fun', 'concept', 'however', 'many', 'times', 'been', 'tried', 'again', 'Overall', 'not', 'episode', 'would', 'recommend', 'buy', 'are', 'hard-core', 'fan', 'are', ""n't"", 'hard-core', 'fan', 'why', 'hell', 'are', 'reading']",N/A
