I have a deep love of history, and so enjoyed the recent programs very much.  Part of my great interest was because there were so many barbarian tribes it is difficult to keep them all straight.  These programs helped with that issue.  They also made it clear that although they were ""barbarians"" who lived by their wits, mostly in a nomadic life style, the barbaric tribes were very far from being dim-witted wild people only intent on raising havoc with those with whom they came in contact.  I was extremely impressed that it was a barbaric people who first made laminated, recurve bows.  Most of us think of this type of bow as something invented in recent years for hunting purposes!  They were and still are one of the most powerful, long reaching bows ever made.  Although they were called ""barbarians"" and were, in truth, overall a cruel people, they were extremely intelligent which helped them 'live by their wits'.  Who is to say the barbarian tribes were any more cruel than the Romans who delighted in throwing people to the lions, calling it entertainment!

1005043,A3PR4ZSBDUL4EG,B000GJ0LFY,"Matthew S. Schweitzer ""zohoe""","[63, 63]","This is the second DVD set from the History Channel that focuses on the Barbarian tribes of the Dark Ages. This series includes episodes on the Vandals, Franks, Lombards, and the Saxons. The first Barbarian series was an excellent introduction to a forgotten period in European history and despite some minor flaws, was thoroughly enjoyable. This second set, available currently through the History Channel, continues to bring this period to life as never before.In the years leading up to and following the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, hordes of often hungry and warlike barbarians swarmed into Roman lands from the East and North, inundating an already weak Imperial government in Rome. In many cases, these barbarian tribes were hired as mercenaries and served the Empire as hired muscle against other barbarians. This series focuses on some of the most famous of these groups, two of which went on to become extremely important in post- Imperial Europe. The Franks, under the ruthless, but powerful, King Clovis, would found a great kingdom of their own and lay the foundations for the Holy Roman Empire. The Saxons, surging west from Germania, would launch an invasion of Britain, claiming lands vacated by the retreating Romans, and served as the deadly enemies of the Britannic warlord who became the basis for the mythical King Arthur. The Vandals and the Lombards, though less well-known, also left their bloody mark on history as enemies of the Empire. This period of history saw the collapse of civilization in the West and the emergence of a chaotic time known to history as the Dark Ages. At the same time, Christianity spread throughout Europe, largely at the hands of the Barbarians themselves who came to embrace, at least nominally, a belief in Christ.The History Channel's documentaries aren't always perfect and only so much can be presented in a one-hour episode. That said, I found this series very entertaining and educational. As with so many other such DVDs, this set serves as a introduction to a complex subject, but one worth exploring for those with an interest.",5,More Barbarians From the History Channel,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,2103,"['second', 'DVD', 'set', 'History', 'Channel', 'Barbarian', 'tribes', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'series', 'episodes', 'Vandals', 'Franks', 'Lombards', 'Saxons', 'first', 'Barbarian', 'series', 'was', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'forgotten', 'period', 'European', 'history', 'minor', 'flaws', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'second', 'set', 'available', 'currently', 'History', 'Channel', 'bring', 'period', 'life', 'never', 'years', 'leading', 'up', 'following', 'collapse', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'West', 'hordes', 'often', 'hungry', 'warlike', 'barbarians', 'swarmed', 'Roman', 'East', 'North', 'inundating', 'already', 'weak', 'Imperial', 'government', 'Rome', 'many', 'cases', 'barbarian', 'tribes', 'were', 'hired', 'mercenaries', 'served', 'Empire', 'hired', 'muscle', 'other', 'barbarians', 'series', 'most', 'famous', 'groups', 'two', 'went', 'become', 'extremely', 'important', 'post-', 'Imperial', 'Europe', 'Franks', 'ruthless', 'powerful', 'King', 'Clovis', 'would', 'found', 'great', 'kingdom', 'own', 'lay', 'foundations', 'Holy', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'Saxons', 'surging', 'west', 'Germania', 'would', 'launch', 'invasion', 'Britain', 'claiming', 'lands', 'vacated', 'retreating', 'Romans', 'served', 'deadly', 'enemies', 'Britannic', 'warlord', 'who', 'became', 'basis', 'mythical', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Vandals', 'Lombards', 'though', 'less', 'well-known', 'also', 'left', 'bloody', 'mark', 'history', 'enemies', 'Empire', 'period', 'history', 'saw', 'collapse', 'civilization', 'West', 'emergence', 'chaotic', 'time', 'known', 'history', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'same', 'time', 'Christianity', 'spread', 'Europe', 'largely', 'hands', 'Barbarians', 'who', 'came', 'embrace', 'least', 'nominally', 'belief', 'Christ.The', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentaries', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'perfect', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'presented', 'one-hour', 'episode', 'said', 'found', 'series', 'very', 'entertaining', 'educational', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'such', 'DVDs', 'set', 'introduction', 'complex', 'subject', 'one', 'worth', 'exploring', 'interest']",Barbarians 2

The story of the barbarian invasions is one that needs to be told graphically, and violently, while noting the elements of political intrigue that cut down the successive rulers of the tribes. The acting in this documentary is excellent, the choreographed battles seem realistic in how they might have actually played out, and you can keep track of which barbarian king is plotting against which other king and against the roman empire.
