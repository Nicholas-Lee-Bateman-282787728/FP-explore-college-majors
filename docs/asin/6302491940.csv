I was sitting here on Nov 19th thinking I'll watch TIJ, with Caine, again: it's a really silly, silly movie. I must be psychic. You stole my title. Anyway, this is a ludicrous, ridiculous film, made up of a lot of little disconnected sketches which don't really add up to a full-scale drawing. If there is a theme or a moral, it seems to be that whatever kind of car you drive, you'll be seeing it coming down the mountain, sooner or later. The camera just loved those spinning, crashing, blazing cars, and couldn't take its eye off them. Irene Handl was a natural genius; and I believe she was just like that in real life. Benny Hill was a bit wasted. Truly, nothing much made much sense in this story. Characters came and went, popped up improbably all over the place. Like Caine in the prison toilet, or Coward in Harley Street. And what about that Fred Emney? A genuine one-off character. Pythonesque, is what I say.

'The Italian Job' (1969) is restored in amazing detail, showcasing exquisite location photography throughout numerous countrysides and cityscapes in England, Ireland and Italy, as well as some equally impressive interiors and stunt-driving footage.

Sanderman,"[3, 5]","""The Italian Job"" is another movie that begins with a lot of promise and dwindles as the clock rolls on-fortunately capped at 90 minutes or so.  The opening sequence, as the credits roll, is a memorable scene that caught me completely off guard.  I enjoyed the young Michael Caine's acting.  His charm and personality definitely help carry the film throughout its length.  The quirky setup of the film is quite inventive, including a job that is not planned from the ground up, but rather inherited after the death of its mastermind.  The film itself does not focus upon the heist; rather, it chooses to direct its attention to the getaway.  This makes up the extended action sequence of the film, starring the little minis.  The chase sequence is quite enjoyable to watch and I waited the entire movie to see it.  I particularly liked the inventive end to the chase sequence and the comedy that is woven into the driving.""The Italian Job"" does not take itself seriously, and neither do I.  The ending, as the documentary implies, is the ultimate cliffhanger.  I wasn't sure what to make of it-or whether or not I enjoyed it.  I can say that I appreciated its originality and I'm glad the film did not descend into a classic heist ending with everyone patting each other on the back.  You'll have to watch it for yourself to decide.As far as comparing it to the remake, you just simply cannot do it.  The films are miles apart and have very little in common.

315961,AUEHG0DB54B7K,6302491940,David A. Wend,"[8, 12]","I saw the 2003 remake of The Italian Job before I saw the 1969 version.  The chief difference between the films is that the first film is a comedy while the second is meant as an action-drama.  The first Italian Job is filled with a large number of gang members about whom we know nothing in the film concentrating on the main players - Michael Caine and Noel Coward.  With the 2003 version we get to know each team member and their specialty and a lot of the fun are the different likes/dislikes Charlie's team and how they interact with each other.  Benny Hill, as the computer expert, in the first Italian Job is more interested in fat women than turning traffic control in Turin upside down; his role has no real humor and is too small to be of any consequence.Michael Caine makes a good Charlie but he is also not the brains behind the operation: Rossano Brazzi (who is done in by the Mafia at the opening) has planned the job and although the Mafia boss (played by Raf Valone) is threatening he is inconsequential during the heist when he could pop up as a surprise for Charlie and the gang.  The 2003 Italian Job keeps you on the edge until the very end. The chase in the 1969 film is good but it is hardly the thrilling ride in the 2003 film where Charlie and company are seriously challenged; the police in the first film are bumbling at best.Sadly, I did not find much of interest in the first Italian Job and can only recommend the film for Michael Caine's performance.

This film placed high in the poll, above the likes of ""A Hard Days Night"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"" to name a few. ""Empire"", the British film magazine, on the DVD release of the film called it a ""bank holiday classic"".  Let's just say that while this is far from a bad film, something must be lost in the translation.

The caper itself is amazingly well crafted.  The crew's escape through a traffic jam in British Mini Coopers is even more impressive.  What this film lacks in my mind is any characters that would give you some emotional attachment.  Michael Caine is the star here and leader of the crew and he is suave, but a little too detached for my liking.

I am not going to make comments on how much better or worse this one was in comparison. What I will say is they leave so much out. Why is the character Michael Caine plays such a celebrity criminal? How is it that a major crime boss can come and go as he pleases from a high security prison? And didn't have more capable people involved? Left all the details in the hands of the main character? How was this supposed to be funny? Making fun of the Italians and the mob? Nah, it just didn't go over well. While I understand this was made in the 60's, and reflects attitudes from that time, it just didn't gel for me. I watched the entire film, and the highlights were the circuitous route the stunt drivers took, and how well they drove (for stunt driving back then). Meh. The supposed cliff-hanger ending just showcased the bumbling of the main character, and the whole operation. Throwing a bicycle into the power grid kills it? Doubtful. Sure, this was supposed to be a comic caper, and for the time probably did just fine. On its own, it's still okay, but it would have been a low-budget film that would have seen little screen time, I think, even with an actor like Caine involved. I like Caine as an actor, and as a comedian, and have enjoyed far better films with him as lead. Feel like I wasted my time, but stayed through it so I could have a basis for comparison against the remake.

Its principal virtue is that it doesn't take itself at all seriously: we know that Charlie (Michael Caine) and his gang will probably not get away with the money, but it's worthwhile watching the way in which he completes the heist and then tries to get away through the streets of Turin and subsequently through the mountains.  As the Mr. Big behind the whole operation, Noel Coward plays himself; by the late Sixties, he had acquired quasi-cult status, reveling in his reputation.  This is precisely the kind of character he plays in the film.  In historical terms, Peter Collinson's film is an advertisement for the Swinging Sixties, with Britain at the center of new movements in fashion and/or coolness.  The iconic Minis - used by the gang to complete their escape - are frequently shown in close-up escaping from the more cumbersome Italian police vehicles.  On the soundtrack, the famous theme celebrating &#34;The Self Preservation Society&#34; attests to the virtues of capitalism and individual effort.

But first he has to get the funding, and turns to Criminal Mastermind and Big Man, Mr Bridger, played by Noel Coward who adds a veteran aspect to the cast of actors; Even a young Robert Powell ('The Detectives') makes an appearance.  Reluctant at first, Mr Bridger gives the reins to Croker and everything goes to plan... although the training is a bit on the unsuccessful side!  They travel to Italy, run into the mafia, who aren't best pleased of their intentions and then proceed to bring the town of Turin to a standstill; With the help of Prof. Simon Peach, Benny Hill, who further establishes the film's comedic value!  The job is done, and the escape begins, with some breathtaking and enormous action chase sequences, as the minis come into play.  But things go sorely wrong and the boys find themselves in a predicament.... what will they do...The film had huge support from Remy Julienne's Stunt Team and Giovanni Agnelli, the Fiat Giant, who released the Fiat town of Turin into the hands of the production team for a day of madness.Having originally had a different ending to the film, of the team driving off into sunset, one of the producers came up with the current closure which leaves the film on a cliff-hanger, so to speak; which wasn't supported by the entire crew, but has proved to be a winner.  No other film has had such a open and inventive ending as The Italian Job.The film is a perfect example of British inspiration which lead to one of the most influential comedy capers of all time.

315981,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,6302491940,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[50, 52]","A double feature was recently offered on cable TV that allowed me to view ""The Italian Job"" twice - the 1969 version with Michael Caine and the 2003 version. The two films have little in common except a gold bullion robbery, 4 million dollars worth in 1969, and 27 million in 2003, to allow for the decreasing value of the dollar and bigger and better ways to spend it! I enjoyed the 2003 thriller but the older film is really an excellent comedy. I am so glad that I had the opportunity to see it, because I missed it, and lots of laughs, the first time around.""The Italian Job"" (1969) is a campy caper packed with 1960s nostalgia. There are enough gadgets and girls in this film to make even James Bond content, although Bond would never work with the bumbling, quirky characters that Michael Caine, called Charlie Croker here, is forced to deal with. The film opens with a choreographed hit by the Italian Mafia. The choreography could have been done for the June Taylor Dancers. It's a riot! Anyway, Roger Beckerman, a brilliant thief, is murdered because he had masterminded a potential heist to take place in Turin, Italy, involving millions of dollars of Chinese gold bullion. Beckerman leaves a tape for Charlie Croker, who has just been released from a British prison. The video tape, to be viewed in the event of Beckerman's death, explains the entire caper and offers Charlie the opportunity to do the job. Charlie gets the funding for the project from Mr. Bridger, played by a wonderfully comic Noel Coward. Bridger is an inmate of the prison where Charlie had spent the last few years and he rules the UK underworld like a king, from his jail cell, with guards and inmates paying him homage. Croker fights off the advances of gorgeous blondes with one hand while he uses the other to whip into shape his motley crew of screwball bandits.The dialogue is hilarious at times, especially when the team of thieves, who seem to have a collective IQ of 75, go at each other like recalcitrant adolescent schoolboys. Croker who occasionally is forced to step out of his role as master-thief to play schoolmaster, yells at his men during a particularly delicate operation, ""Get yourselves sorted out and shut-up! No one talks anymore except me!"" During a meeting with the Mafia leader who threatens to kill Croker and his men if they pull-off the job, Charlie responds, ""You will be making a grave error if you kill us. There are one-quarter million Italians in Britain and they will be made to suffer. Every restaurant, cafe, ice cream parlor, gambling den and nightclub in London, Liverpool and Glasgow will be smashed. Mr. Bridger will drive them into the sea!""This film is pure fun with the mother of all car chases as the grand finale. Not to be missed!JANA",4,"A Hilarious, Campy Caper!

Michael Caine is released from jail. A colleague of is murdered in Italy and his not-terribly-grieving widow brings Caine a message - on film, no less. The sight of Michael Caine sitting next to a film projector watching the outline of the planned heist is hilarious in this day of digital cameras and video iPods.The story involves Caine getting the permission and assistance of Mr. Bridger, a crime boss who leads a life of luxury behind the walls, recruiting a gang and making arrangements to steal a $ 4-million dollar gold shipment in Turin, Italy. (Four million sounds so small these days, doesn't it?)The story, frankly, is very thin. This is comedy, not drama. The real pleasure comes in the execution of the heist. A rogue ""computer expert"" (a hilarious Benny Hill doing his usual schtick) substitutes a tape - yes, a tape - at the traffic control center, which in turn sets off a massive traffic jam.The armored convoy carrying the gold is trapped in the midst of this jam and the rest of the film is occupied with the getaway. The getaway features a classic, very funny and very long car chase. Again, this is a comedy, not drama and almost cartoon-like . . . and great fun.The ending comes as a bit of a surprise and leaves the audience hanging, so to speak.All in all, a fun film. Funny almost as much for how dated it seems as it is for the humor of it.

The latest, of course, was the REMAKE of ""Ocean's Eleven"" and the REMAKE of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"", both not as well done as the originals. And, then, there is the remake of ""The Italian Job"".However, for what it is, this original version is still a very fun film and is definately one of the all-time Car Buff favorites because of the Minis and, unlike some, Car Buffs enjoy ALL the Mini scenes, especially the practice sessions (much more fun than the remake's). The ending theme song is still hugely popular with British car lovers.By today's standards the original ""The Italian Job"" may seem lame to the younger crowd since there are no hotshot special effects...or loads of dead bodies. And English humor is, well, different than Americans'.  On the other hand, all the car stunts are real and fun and the cast does not take themselves too seriously. The movie isn't as slick as the new version with Mark W., but I still like it more. It is a very 60s movie.For one thing, there is more to the getaway than the remake. However, just like the remake, the crew is stealing money from the Mafia, but, unlike the remake, the ending isn't as tidy and happy for the robbers. Funny as can be, but not exactly happy. It's a real cliff hanger.This movie is also timely right now since BMW has introduced the new retro designed Rover MINI to the U.S. market. And, as a matter of information, used/restored ""old"" Minis are still being imported to the U. S. in decent numbers by private individuals. I've heard that there are an estimated 10,000 classic Minis still in the U.S. I belong to a Mini club in Texas with well over 100 members. Many, like myself, own more than one and many also own the new BMW MINI.The only odd aspect about this movie is why it took so long to finally be offered on tape and then, after a couple of years, get down to such a great price since Michael Caine starred in it. I can remember waiting and waiting for this movie to be released on VHS.  Something along the lines of the wait for ""LeMans"". And, then, it wasn't cheap.

The movie open with a red Lamborghini Miura who is running on a beautiful scenic road with entertaining music playing... until it hit a bulldozer parked on the middle of the road and explode, supposedly killing the likeable driver, and then ceremonially dumped off the cliff. Flowers are even thrown in the river. A similar thing happen in the 1979 Blake Edward's movie ""10"" where George Webber's yellow Rolls-Royce hit a police car, but apparently suffer only minor damages even if he use another car for the rest of the movie. I had seen the excellent movie ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" a few years ago before seeing this one, so I have an excellent unadulterated opinion of Micheal Caine. The story didn't make any sense to me who was expecting a serious movie, I had to see it a second time to really understand they were intentionally making fun of him, like putting classy classical music when he act like a slob... I figure they told him they were filming a comedy...  Michael Caine's career, who look helpless and wear a dark blue suit for most scenes, apparently never recovered having for done that movie... There's also 3 making-of documentaries made recently on the DVD, the persons interviewed seem quite overwhelmed by what happened and seem to put the responsibility of the whole project to one of the producer... I can't understand why someone would want to do something like that to a excellent actor who didn't do anything to him... It should also be noted that this is the last movie in which the famous English playwright Noel Coward appear, he died of a heart attack in 1973... It may be unrelated, but after a very successful start in the 60s the Lamborghini carmaker was on the brink of bankruptcy when Ferrucio Lamborghini sold it in 1972, his financial troubles came when the South African and Bolivian government cancelled their orders of tractors who had already been manufactured in 1971... I'm not recommending this movie at all, it's a waste of time even when seen just out of curiosity, in fact the DVD is apparently out of print... It should be precised that in my opinion the 2003 movie with the same title is not really a remake, the story is similar but it was made differently...",1,They're scrapping a Lamborghini Miura...

There is seductive music and beautiful scenery and plenty of restrained continental humor.I have no interest in cars, but even I admitt the classic models of the time featured here are beautiful and add to the ambiance of elegance infusing the scenes .The chase is more clever than thrilling although the site of four cars performing on the top of a tall rounded building still makes me shake my head when I see it thinking they must have been mad. Remember, no remote control models or studio set ups were used here.  That car jumping from roof to roof is real.Don't come here looking for an action adventure though - it's more adult than that albeit geared for adults of another generation.Director Collinson's influence makes the movie as good as it could possibly have been.

315989,AYUFQY3XG4ZBR,6302491940,"Johnny Sideburns ""21st Century Renaissance Man""","[15, 15]","It is true that original ideas in Hollywood are even rarer than lasting show-biz marriages, but the remake of the '60's British classic ""The Italian Job"" stands out as the glaring example of the industry trying to pass off flash and flair in the guise of eye-candy actors and high-tech special effects in place of the human elements of acting chemistry and film craftsmanship.The 1969 version of ""The Italian Job"" succeeded on so many levels; it was a fantastic film that was well-indicative of its time (the afterglow of the sexual revolution as well as the London fashion boom seen recently only on a second-hand basis from the Austin Powers movies in addition to Ing-er-lund's winning of the 1966 World Cup, British hipsters could actually display the Union Jack and sing ""Rule, Britannia"", unthinkable for the UK apologists of today) as well as a crime caper with a decidely different twist to the wit of say, the Rat Pack version of ""Ocean's 11"".  And the distinctly European take on the car chase already iconocized in Steve McQueen's ""Bullitt"" demonstrated by the use of the ORIGINAL bumper-to-bumper crumple zoned Mini Coopers as opposed to the full-throated Detoit muscle flexed by ""Bullitt""'s Dodge Charger and Ford Mustang is ably accentuated by some of the best stunt driving seen in a generation among some of the most beautifully picturesque backdrops in the world.This is an admittedly dated, though terrifically quirky and extremely fun movie to watch.  It's a fine example of why Michael Caine was one of the most charming actors of his generation and another example of what a movie can be when given over to human inspiration and creativity as opposed to a cookie-cutter script handed over to an overzealous special effects department.  Rent the Wahlberg/Theron/Norton remake if you must; it's a good enough example of the quick fix mentality that prevents anything new and original from succeeding in Hollywood today.

Rather than trying to keep on the straight and narrow, he immediately embarks on trying to steal gold bullion from the Italian's.  He gets the backing of Mr. Bridger, London's head of crime, who's in prison himself.To help him carry out the plan, he gathers together an array of colourful people including Benny Hill as the clever professor who has a penchant for big women.Add to the mix three Mini Cooper's as the unlikely get away cars and you're in for a fun filled, action packed film that sees Charlie and his gang trying to outrun both the police and the Mafia.The build up to the heist is interesting and funny but the unique get away at the end is the scene stealer.  Through underground sewers and subways, down church steps, through rivers and up to the very rooftops, it's gripping and highly entertaining.  I think anyone that watches the film will just yearn to have a Mini Cooper afterwards.Of course, the cliff hanger of an ending just fits so perfectly too.To add; I also think the soundtrack is great and the film produced one of the most, if not THE, memorable quote of all time from Michael Caine when he sees the truck explode into thousands of pieces during a practice run and then turns to the unfortunate explosives 'expert' and says, &quot;You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off.&quot;Mr. Caine has said that he still has people come up to him in the street and say that to him, even now!To conlcude, The Italian Job is very patriotic, even the cars are red, white and blue, and I think it's the masterpiece for all British classic's.So, &quot;get your skates on, mate&quot; and buy it now - your collection is lacking if this film isn't a part of it.",5,Self Preservation Society!,976752000,"12 14, 2000",2000,1804,"['movie', 'defined', 'word', 'Caine', 'Charlie', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'Rather', 'trying', 'keep', 'straight', 'narrow', 'immediately', 'trying', 'steal', 'gold', 'bullion', 'Italian', 'backing', 'Mr.', 'Bridger', 'London', 'head', 'crime', 'who', 'prison', 'himself.To', 'help', 'carry', 'out', 'plan', 'together', 'array', 'colourful', 'people', 'including', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'clever', 'professor', 'who', 'penchant', 'big', 'women.Add', 'mix', 'three', 'Mini', 'Cooper', 'unlikely', 'get', 'away', 'cars', ""'re"", 'fun', 'filled', 'action', 'packed', 'film', 'Charlie', 'gang', 'trying', 'outrun', 'police', 'Mafia.The', 'build', 'up', 'heist', 'interesting', 'funny', 'unique', 'get', 'away', 'end', 'scene', 'stealer', 'underground', 'sewers', 'subways', 'down', 'church', 'steps', 'rivers', 'up', 'very', 'gripping', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'think', 'anyone', 'film', 'will', 'just', 'yearn', 'have', 'Mini', 'Cooper', 'afterwards.Of', 'course', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'ending', 'just', 'fits', 'so', 'perfectly', 'too.To', 'add', 'also', 'think', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'film', 'produced', 'one', 'most', 'not', 'THE', 'memorable', 'quote', 'time', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'when', 'truck', 'explode', 'thousands', 'pieces', 'practice', 'run', 'then', 'unfortunate', 'explosives', 'quot', ""'re"", 'only', 'supposed', 'blow', 'bloody', 'doors', 'off.', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Caine', 'said', 'still', 'people', 'come', 'up', 'street', 'say', 'even', 'now', 'conlcude', 'Italian', 'Job', 'very', 'patriotic', 'even', 'cars', 'are', 'red', 'white', 'blue', 'think', 'masterpiece', 'British', ""classic's.So"", 'quot', 'get', 'skates', 'mate', 'quot', 'buy', 'now', 'collection', 'lacking', 'film', ""n't"", 'part']",Italian Job VHS

I then sat down to watch it and emerged two hours later with the grin of a 51-year old Cheshire cat on Viagra.We all know ""The Italian Job"" is a Sixties classic, but what you don't know is that this 40th Anniversary reissue of it (issued 15 June 2009 in the UK) is simply off the charts good...First up is the print - which is GLORIOUS - as pristine as you could hope for and a joy from start to finish. And although it doesn't state it on the outer box, this is the fully restored British Film Institute version, which has been cleaned up frame-by-frame (and those clean shots are used in the ""Making Of"" extras too). One of those features is the 30th Anniversary reissue trailer from 10 years ago, which uses the famous ""...doors off..."" van sequence. Untouched - it's covered in scratches and has no definition whatsoever - it allows you see what the film stock did look like as opposed to how beautiful it looks now after restoration.There are so many scenes that now stand out - as Matt Monro's cheesy song ""On Days Like These"" plays and the car drives through the Alps in the opening credits - when Charlie comes out of prison as he walks through the gates and Maggie Blye greets him in a stolen car from the Pakistani Embassy - when the three Mini Coopers climb the roof of the football stadium with the Italian cops in pursuit - it's just all BEAUTIFUL. The BFI have also done ""Zulu"", ""The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner"" and ""Saturday Night And Sunday Morning"" and this is up to the same stunning standard as they are (see my reviews).The extras are generous too (nearly two hours worth):1. Commentary with Screenwriter Tony Kennedy Martin and Author Matthew Field2. Commentary by Producers Michael Deeley and Author Matthew Field3. Mini Adventures (in HD)4. ""Self Preservation Society: The Making Off The Italian Job"" (in HD) - features new interviews with the cast, writers, producers including Michel Caine, Maggie Blye, Troy Kennedy Martin, Michael Deeley, reminiscences on Noel Coward, the Director Peter Collinson, Quincy Jones on the cool score etc...5. Music Video (in HD)6. The Deleted Scene With Commentary by Author Matthew Field7. Theatrical Trailer8. Re-release TrailerThe casting of course was a mixture of luck, fate and genius - Caine perfect as Charlie Croker the likely lad, Benny Hill as the groping computer boffin, the suave yet deadly Raf Vallone as the Turin Mafia boss and Tony Beckley as the dandily dressed Camp Freddy. But the biggest coup of all was Noel Coward as Mr. Bridger - the master-criminal doing time in her Majesty's prison service. He has tea and scones, worries about the British economy and has his cell plastered with pictures of the Queen. Coward is just priceless as he lords about the decking of the prison block, ""Rule Britannia"" played behind him by a string quartet - it's enough to make you howl with laughter...You see you forget how funny The Italian Job is - the catty gay tailor saying Charlie's pre-prison clothes could now be part of a museum exhibit, Coward standing beside two prison guards as they hand him his two newspapers and a toilet roll. Prison Governor John Le Mesurier's look of astonishment as Coward complains that `his' toilet has been invaded by Michael Caine (pitching the heist to him) - a man's toilet is his castle... The snooty garage manager played beautifully by John Clive counting the money Michael Caine has just given him for looking after his Aston Martin DB - it's been in his garage for two years while Caine was away in `India'. ""I was shooting tigers old boy..."" Garage owner counting the fifties, "" ...there must have been an awful lot of tigers sir...""The Turin locations are wonderfully colourful, the mountain scenes as crisp as those in the James Bond reissues and Caine's freckles clearer than ever - all of it - what a peach!I've reviewed a lot of oldies on the new BLU RAY format of late - some successful, some woeful - but this is up there with the very best. In fact, as a man who adores the medium and believes in its possibilities, I suspect it'll tickle Michael Caine pink that his films ""Zulu"" and ""The Italian Job"" are both going a long way towards establishing BLU RAY as `the' format to restore old movies to and preserve them properly.

316001,AKCF45Z2DV6TN,6302491940,"Michael Weber ""fairportfan""","[11, 12]","This isn't *quite* the ultimate &quot;chase&quot; film -- that would be either &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; (for a relatively serious film) or &quot;The Junkman&quot; (for a comedy), but it's one of the better-acted.Michael Caine and Noel Coward anchor the comedy nicely -- Coward's &quot;Mr Bridger&quot;, the undisputed head of the British underworld, ruling crime with an iron hand from a comfortable cell in a pirson where the warders and Governor act as his personalk service staff, is a wonderful conceit.  Caine's Charlie Croker, very much the smooth fast-talking all-round crook of working-class origins, plays off Bridger wonderfully to get permission to do the job, to the point of appealing to Bridger's obsessive patriotism (God *is* an Englishman) by pointing out that stealing four million dollars in Italy will help the balance of trade.Roughly half the film or a bit more is devoted to getting the gang together (including hiring a computer expert [played by Benny Hill] who may be the single most over-the-top element in a film that hovers at ot near that metaphorical &quot;top&quot; for most of its unning time.)A recent poll in Britain voted the line &quot;You were just supposed to blow the bloody *doors* off!&quot; as the best all-time movie line (i prefer the similarly-inspired &quot;Think you used enough dynamite, Butch?&quot;, but won't quibble); it's certainly appropriate...The gang have to do the job in spite of the Mafia (personified by Raf Vallone) -- after, all, this is their home turf and the Brits are invaders -- and this conflict leads to the horrific destruction of some simply lovely Sixties high-performance cars on a mountain road -- the punchline to the opening credit sequence is particularly painful, because so unexpeced.Use of the original Mini Coopers[1] as the getaway cars is inspired; their small size, excellent handling, good turn of speed and the fact that they were currently being built under license by an Italian firm based in Turin, the setting of the heist, all contribute to the fun of the chase.  And the efforts of Remy Julienne and his stunt team certainly don't hurt; the knowledge that all of these stunts were done for real, not by computer imagery, is impressive.By 1969 the Mini in all its variants was history in the US, and though it continued in production worldwide for thirty years more, the American market diodn' reward the film-makers as well as they might have hoped, and the sort-of-planned sequel in which we see how Charlie and Co get out of the (literal) cliffhanger that ends this film was never made.Since Amazon is offerenig a two-fer of this DVD and the actually-not-bad (if not great) exercise in BMW product-placement &quot;remake&quot; with Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron, one might do worse than to get both of them and spend an otherwise-unoccupied afternoon comparing them, spoting the little grace-note references to the original inserted into the &quot;remake&quot;'s unrelated plot.  (Certainly a more-rewarding afternoon than one would have doing the same with the badly-acted-but-incredible-chase original &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; and the execrable 2000 &quot;remake&quot;...)The Bottom Line: The better of the two &quot;Italian Jobs&quot; (not surprisingly).[1] History: The Cooper and Cooper &quot;S&quot; were high-performance variants of a small car produced by British Motors under the Morris and Ausin names; not all Minis were Coopers.  The &quot;S&quot; used a larger, more powerful engine, was banned for emissions rerasons in the US in 1966, the car itself was unable to pass crash-test standards in 1967 and so disappeared from this country.Production continued in England (and in Italy under license, which leads to a gag in the original film) for many years after that, but was finally discontinued.The Mini was the first of the &quot;two-box&quot; subcompacts with transverse engine and front-wheel drive, the direct ancestor conceptually of the VW Rabbit, Honda Civic and so on; none of them, however, used anything like its unique &quot;Hydrolastic&quot; suspension, which was completely hydraulic, with no springs or conventional shock absorbers.It was smaller than those, at somewhere between 1500 and 1800 pounds and using ten-inch wheels.BMW bought the name, and has recently brought out the car they call a &quot;Mini Cooper&quot;, much the same shape, but much bigger and more luxurious -- the BMW &quot;Cooper&quot; weighs almost 3000 pounds and uses wheels as large as fifteen inches.Those of us who cherish the original Mini in all its variants are not decieved...",4,Better Acting Than Some

Caine's thief treats his women with casual disdain, his cohorts in the heist with even more casual disregard, but somehow manages to make us love him anyway.

Once you've seen it you can vaguely recall the particulars of the plot (which is threadbare at best). Still, it's an intoxicating blend of 1960's super kitsch and modish glam-bam.

Although there isn't a whole lot of pyrotechnics like the remake, this film makes up for that by being a lot of fun, and quite funny at times. Sure, there's a lack of character development for most of the members of the team, but most of them have a little moment or two here and there. Arguably, the best part of the movie outside of the performances and humor is the climactic Mini Cooper chase through the streets of Turin, followed by a (SPOILER!) literal cliffhanger of an ending, which I think works better than the happy ending in the remake.

316019,A387BD735MI50R,6302491940,R. Schultz,"[3, 3]","This heist movie starts out feeling a little dated, with Michael Caine playing another so-many-birds-so-little-time Alfie-type character - in this case just released from prison and transplanted to Italy. But I was soon swept up in the spirit of the armored car robbery caper he orchestrates. And even though I'm usually bored by car chases, I found this movie's get-away sequence to be ingenious and almost thrilling. It's off and running through impossibly narrow archways, down steep staircases, over bridges, with one literal cliffhanger along the way. A great music score adds to the bounce and jounce of every hurdle that's overcome.As an additional bonus for foreign car buffs, the DVD includes an out-take sequence with the robbers' cars and the police cars doing an extended, elaborately choreographed minuet in a marbled ballroom. The director rightly decided that this surreal episode didn't fit in with his generally realistic picture. But it's good that the dance was saved.The DVD bonus materials are overall as interesting as the picture itself. The director's commentary is especially worthwhile, because he recorded it relatively recently, so he was able to reflect backwards and forwards over each actor's career. You get to hear ""whatever became of..."" Everyone knows what Michael Caine has been doing. But Peter Collinson recaps the careers of Noel Coward, Raf Vallone, Benny Hill, and others who also star in the movie.This director commentary is like falling into convivial conversation with a master filmmaker. I only disagreed with one opinion he had about his finished picture. He said he didn't like the way Benny Hill's infatuation with LARGE women had been scripted. I think Collinson felt the character's on-screen enthusiasm, with Hill frequently managing to bury himself in some woman's abundance, was in bad taste.But I personally found Hill's irrepressible enthusiasm rather appealing.

With a mostly British cast, headed by lovable bad boy Michael Caine (The Ipcress File), the film follows the adventures of a criminal gang, engaged in a bold robbery attempt, executed with precision, while gloriously waving the Union Jack in the face of the opposition.Charlie Croker (Caine) is just out of prison, when he receives information about a robbery scheme, from his friend Roger Beckerman (Rossano Brazzi), who has just been killed in Italy, by the Mafia.  Beckerman's plan, involves stealing a delivery of gold en route to the Fiat plant in Turin, Italy.  The idea is to utilize the city's traffic control system to create gridlock, to enable the thieves to escape.  With most of the plan outlined, Croker needs to work out the details, find a crew, and get financial backing.  For the later, he turns to Mr. Bridger (Noel Coward), who although behind bars in one of her Majesty's prisons, is still the man in charge.  Although initially resistant, seeing that it would be a huge boost for British morale, Bridger greenlights the Italian Job.With support of girlfriend Lorna (Margaret Blye), Croker gathers materials, and puts his group together, including math whiz Professor Simon Peach (Benny Hill).  The group arrives in Italy, but experiences car damage, and encounter a major roadblock from the Mafia.  Undaunted, the Brits continue as planned, infiltrating Milan's traffic control center, and executing their plan to near perfection.The Italian Job is probably most known for the mad driving of a set of red, white, and blue mini Coopers, used to transport the stolen gold.  Maneuvering through the streets, sewers and sidewalks of Milan, the three minis blaze through all manner of alternate routes.  With world renowned Remy Julienne, and his driving team behind the wheel, the film features an impressive, and light hearted display of driving skill.  As the mission nears completion, Quincy Jones's soundtrack builds and elevates to celebratory levels, with Michael Caine leading the bawdy singing.  Making their escape in a bus, collecting the gold, and recklessly tossing the mini's down the side of a mountain, the group's hubris goes a little too far, and the film ends memorably in a literal cliffhanger, for the self-preservation society.Producer Michael Deeley, came up with the unusual ending, and had a resolution in mind for a sequel, which never came to be.  The point of the film was to showcase the brazen execution by Croker's team, and to have ripping good time in the process.  In that, The Italian Job was an uproarious success.  Caine and his boys exercise some restraint, but they certainly push very hard to hold up the British end.  Back in England, those behind bars offer a glorious salute to Mr. Bridger and his boys, for pulling off the outrageous heist.The enhanced version looks and sound great.  The cinematography in Milan and the Italian mountains is often delightful.  Extras include a commentary track by producer Michael Deeley, and author Matthew Field.  It's a little dry, but is still informative.  There are also some well produced making of featurettes, but unfortunately there is no contribution from the iconic Michael Caine.",4,"holding up the British end, the Italian job is an uproarious success . . .",1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,3323,"['long', 'line', 'English', 'caper', 'films', 'Italian', 'Job', '1969', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Collinson', 'classic', 'example', 'genre', 'mostly', 'British', 'cast', 'headed', 'lovable', 'bad', 'boy', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Ipcress', 'File', 'film', 'adventures', 'criminal', 'gang', 'engaged', 'bold', 'robbery', 'attempt', 'executed', 'precision', 'gloriously', 'waving', 'Union', 'Jack', 'face', 'opposition.Charlie', 'Croker', 'Caine', 'just', 'prison', 'when', 'information', 'robbery', 'scheme', 'friend', 'Roger', 'Beckerman', 'Rossano', 'Brazzi', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'killed', 'Italy', 'Mafia', 'Beckerman', 'plan', 'stealing', 'delivery', 'gold', 'en', 'route', 'Fiat', 'plant', 'Turin', 'Italy', 'idea', 'utilize', 'city', 'traffic', 'control', 'system', 'create', 'gridlock', 'enable', 'thieves', 'escape', 'most', 'plan', 'outlined', 'Croker', 'work', 'out', 'details', 'find', 'crew', 'get', 'financial', 'backing', 'later', 'Mr.', 'Bridger', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'who', 'bars', 'one', 'Majesty', 'prisons', 'still', 'man', 'charge', 'initially', 'resistant', 'seeing', 'would', 'be', 'huge', 'boost', 'British', 'morale', 'Bridger', 'Italian', 'Job.With', 'support', 'girlfriend', 'Lorna', 'Margaret', 'Blye', 'Croker', 'gathers', 'materials', 'group', 'together', 'including', 'math', 'whiz', 'Professor', 'Simon', 'Peach', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'group', 'Italy', 'car', 'damage', 'encounter', 'major', 'roadblock', 'Mafia', 'Undaunted', 'Brits', 'continue', 'planned', 'infiltrating', 'Milan', 'traffic', 'control', 'center', 'executing', 'plan', 'near', 'perfection.The', 'Italian', 'Job', 'probably', 'most', 'known', 'mad', 'driving', 'set', 'red', 'white', 'blue', 'mini', 'Coopers', 'used', 'transport', 'stolen', 'gold', 'Maneuvering', 'streets', 'sewers', 'sidewalks', 'Milan', 'three', 'minis', 'manner', 'alternate', 'routes', 'world', 'renowned', 'Remy', 'Julienne', 'driving', 'team', 'wheel', 'film', 'impressive', 'light', 'hearted', 'display', 'driving', 'skill', 'mission', 'completion', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'soundtrack', 'builds', 'elevates', 'celebratory', 'levels', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'leading', 'bawdy', 'singing', 'Making', 'escape', 'bus', 'collecting', 'gold', 'recklessly', 'tossing', 'mini', 'down', 'side', 'mountain', 'group', 'hubris', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'film', 'memorably', 'literal', 'cliffhanger', 'self-preservation', 'society.Producer', 'Michael', 'Deeley', 'came', 'up', 'unusual', 'ending', 'had', 'resolution', 'mind', 'sequel', 'never', 'came', 'be', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'showcase', 'brazen', 'execution', 'Croker', 'team', 'have', 'ripping', 'good', 'time', 'process', 'Italian', 'Job', 'was', 'uproarious', 'success', 'Caine', 'boys', 'exercise', 'restraint', 'certainly', 'push', 'very', 'hard', 'hold', 'up', 'British', 'end', 'Back', 'England', 'bars', 'offer', 'glorious', 'salute', 'Mr.', 'Bridger', 'boys', 'pulling', 'off', 'outrageous', 'heist.The', 'enhanced', 'version', 'looks', 'sound', 'great', 'cinematography', 'Milan', 'Italian', 'mountains', 'often', 'delightful', 'Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'producer', 'Michael', 'Deeley', 'author', 'Matthew', 'Field', 'little', 'dry', 'still', 'informative', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'produced', 'making', 'featurettes', 'unfortunately', 'contribution', 'iconic', 'Michael', 'Caine']",Italian Job VHS

The re-imagining of OCEAN'S 11 did a nice job as did the re-imagining of THE ITALIAN JOB. Unfortunately, even those both of those movies had some great elements, neither one was original enough to even come up with their own title.The original THE ITALIAN JOB, on the other hand, was made during an era when movies still reeked of originality.  In the film, Charlie Croker (Michael Caine) is released from prison after having served his time. He receives an interesting message from a close friend of his. His friend was in the process of steeling over 4 million dollars in gold right under the noses of the Italian mafia. Unfortunately, the mafia found out about the gig and had him killed. Before he was killed, he had set a plan in motion so that Charlie could take over the operation.Charlie agrees to do the job, but he needs some serious financing. So, Charlie breaks into the prison to visit Mr. Bridger (Noel Coward), one of the most wealthy and well-respected crooks in England. At first Bridger dismisses Charlie's request and has some of his goons pay him a visit. Then he finds out exactly how much is at stake and who they will be stealing the money from. He has a change of heart and give Charlie the money he needs. From there it's one misadventure and adventure after another leading from England to Italy, past mafia goons, to the World Cup, and over some mountains involving $4 million dollars in gold bars and three red, white, and blue Mini-Coopers.The casting and acting in THE ITALIAN JOB is some of the most original in Hollywood history. Michael Caine was not yet a huge star, but had just finished filming ALFIE when he was cast in THE ITALIAN JOB. His role as Charlie Croker made him an international movie sensation. Noel Coward was specially picked by director Peter Collinson because of Coward's generosity to Collinson in his youth. The studio had originally wanted Nicol Williamson, but Collinson swore by Coward. Coward's prescence as the lordly Mr. Bridger added a touch of class to the movie. Then there's Benny Hill, playing the large women loving Professor Simon Peach. The Benny Hill show had yet to be broadcast, but even in the supporting role of Professor Peach, Hill illustrates his connection to bawdiness.The movie includes a famous song entitled ""The Self Preservation Society"" which, in large part because of this movie, has become a favorite song played in English football (soccer) matches. Besides that famous song, there's also several great pieces of dialogue including Michael Caine's line, ""You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!"" which was voted the most memorable film line of all time in a 2003 movie poll.The final scene in THE ITALIAN JOB remains as one of the most memorable, yet most frustrating in all of movie history. The film ends without any resolve because the studio had hoped to make a sequel, but the sequel never came.  It's a dirty shame, really, because this is one movie that a sequel would have added something to the original.The DVD includes the famous deleting ""walzing Minis"" scene, a commentary track, the original trailers, and a documentary. The commentary track is rather interesting to listen along with, but the documentary (chopped into three parts) is incredibly boring!",4,A Classic Comedy Heist.,1111708800,"03 25, 2005",2005,3360,"['classic', 'film', 'genre', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'action', 'past', 'few', 'decades', 'heist', 'film', 're-imagining', 'OCEAN', '11', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'did', 're-imagining', 'THE', 'ITALIAN', 'JOB', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'movies', 'had', 'great', 'elements', 'one', 'was', 'original', 'enough', 'even', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'title.The', 'original', 'THE', 'ITALIAN', 'JOB', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'made', 'era', 'when', 'movies', 'still', 'reeked', 'originality', 'film', 'Charlie', 'Croker', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'released', 'prison', 'having', 'served', 'time', 'interesting', 'message', 'close', 'friend', 'friend', 'was', 'process', 'steeling', '4', 'million', 'dollars', 'gold', 'right', 'noses', 'Italian', 'mafia', 'Unfortunately', 'mafia', 'found', 'gig', 'had', 'killed', 'was', 'killed', 'had', 'set', 'plan', 'motion', 'Charlie', 'could', 'take', 'over', 'operation.Charlie', 'do', 'job', 'serious', 'financing', 'So', 'Charlie', 'prison', 'visit', 'Mr.', 'Bridger', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'one', 'most', 'wealthy', 'well-respected', 'crooks', 'England', 'first', 'Bridger', 'Charlie', 'request', 'goons', 'pay', 'visit', 'Then', 'out', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', 'stake', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'stealing', 'money', 'change', 'heart', 'give', 'Charlie', 'money', 'one', 'misadventure', 'adventure', 'leading', 'England', 'Italy', 'past', 'mafia', 'goons', 'World', 'Cup', 'mountains', 'involving', '4', 'million', 'dollars', 'gold', 'bars', 'three', 'red', 'white', 'blue', 'Mini-Coopers.The', 'casting', 'acting', 'THE', 'ITALIAN', 'JOB', 'most', 'original', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'huge', 'star', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'filming', 'ALFIE', 'when', 'was', 'cast', 'THE', 'ITALIAN', 'JOB', 'role', 'Charlie', 'Croker', 'made', 'international', 'movie', 'sensation', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'was', 'specially', 'picked', 'director', 'Peter', 'Collinson', 'Coward', 'generosity', 'Collinson', 'youth', 'studio', 'had', 'originally', 'wanted', 'Nicol', 'Williamson', 'Collinson', 'swore', 'Coward', 'Coward', 'prescence', 'lordly', 'Mr.', 'Bridger', 'added', 'touch', 'class', 'movie', 'Then', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'playing', 'large', 'women', 'loving', 'Professor', 'Simon', 'Peach', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'show', 'had', 'yet', 'be', 'broadcast', 'even', 'supporting', 'role', 'Professor', 'Peach', 'Hill', 'connection', 'bawdiness.The', 'movie', 'famous', 'song', 'entitled', 'Self', 'Preservation', 'Society', 'large', 'part', 'movie', 'become', 'favorite', 'song', 'played', 'English', 'football', 'soccer', 'matches', 'famous', 'song', 'also', 'several', 'great', 'pieces', 'dialogue', 'including', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'line', ""'re"", 'only', 'supposed', 'blow', 'bloody', 'doors', 'off', 'was', 'voted', 'most', 'memorable', 'film', 'line', 'time', '2003', 'movie', 'final', 'scene', 'THE', 'ITALIAN', 'JOB', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'yet', 'most', 'frustrating', 'movie', 'history', 'film', 'resolve', 'studio', 'had', 'hoped', 'make', 'sequel', 'sequel', 'never', 'came', 'dirty', 'shame', 'really', 'one', 'movie', 'sequel', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'something', 'original.The', 'DVD', 'famous', 'deleting', 'walzing', 'Minis', 'scene', 'commentary', 'track', 'original', 'trailers', 'documentary', 'commentary', 'track', 'rather', 'interesting', 'listen', 'documentary', 'chopped', 'three', 'parts', 'incredibly', 'boring']",Italian Job VHS
316033,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6302491940,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[5, 5]","It seems that good movies inspire remakes. As to whether they are &quot;inspired&quot; remakes is always open to question. Both versions of The Italian Job have unique features that make them interesting but for sheer acting chops and fun (with the exception of Ed Norton in the remake who seems like he's trapped in a film he doesn't like), 1969's The Italian Job is my personal pick of the two. Mark Wahlberg can't hold a candle (and isn't much of an actor frankly)to Michael Caine in the original film.There's almost as many things that make this classic film tick as there are seconds on a clock. The plot focuses more on the getaway than the caper. This unique twist turned the formular on its head. The terrific cast (including the late Noel Coward in his last screen appearence and, of all people, Benny Hill!)features the marvelous Michael Caine in the lead. He gives a great performance and helps the ensemble rise to the occasion.The late Peter Collinson directs with energy and wit bringing to life what could have been, despite its plot twists, a routine film. Collinson is something of a cult director who died relatively young before he could fulfill his full promise as a director. I'd also recommend his cult classic psychological thriller Straight On Till Morning which became available last year on DVD. While it's hampered by some mid-70's editing and visual conventions, Morning more than holds its own with the explotiation films of the time.Complimenting the film is a commentary track which features the film's original producer as well as a number of nice extras. It's great to also have this minor classic finally restored to its proper aspect ratio. The DVD transfer is pretty good and while the quality of the print varies a bit, it's really good on the whole.",4,Terrific late 60's caper film with a couple of twists,1065744000,"10 10, 2003",2003,1787,"['good', 'movies', 'inspire', 'remakes', 'are', 'quot', 'inspired', 'quot', 'remakes', 'always', 'open', 'question', 'versions', 'Italian', 'Job', 'have', 'unique', 'features', 'make', 'interesting', 'sheer', 'acting', 'chops', 'fun', 'exception', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'remake', 'who', 'trapped', 'film', ""n't"", 'like', '1969', 'Italian', 'Job', 'personal', 'pick', 'two', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', ""n't"", 'much', 'actor', 'frankly', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'original', 'film.There', 'almost', 'many', 'things', 'make', 'classic', 'film', 'tick', 'are', 'seconds', 'clock', 'plot', 'more', 'getaway', 'caper', 'unique', 'twist', 'turned', 'formular', 'head', 'terrific', 'cast', 'including', 'late', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'last', 'screen', 'appearence', 'people', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'marvelous', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'lead', 'great', 'performance', 'ensemble', 'rise', 'occasion.The', 'late', 'Peter', 'Collinson', 'energy', 'wit', 'bringing', 'life', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'plot', 'twists', 'routine', 'film', 'Collinson', 'something', 'cult', 'director', 'who', 'died', 'relatively', 'young', 'could', 'fulfill', 'full', 'promise', 'director', ""'d"", 'also', 'recommend', 'cult', 'classic', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Straight', 'Till', 'Morning', 'became', 'available', 'last', 'year', 'DVD', 'hampered', 'mid-70', 'editing', 'visual', 'conventions', 'Morning', 'more', 'own', 'explotiation', 'films', 'time.Complimenting', 'film', 'commentary', 'track', 'film', 'original', 'producer', 'as', 'well', 'number', 'nice', 'extras', 'great', 'also', 'have', 'minor', 'classic', 'finally', 'restored', 'proper', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'pretty', 'good', 'quality', 'print', 'bit', 'really', 'good', 'whole']",Italian Job VHS
