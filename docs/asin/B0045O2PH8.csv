1385810,A1ITCVZ46MUB3A,B0045O2PH8,A Hot Whizzer Summer...,"[5, 8]","This is honestly the first anime I have ever watched where I would have to say there was too much fan service. Now, I don't have anything wrong with fan service normally, but this show had so much of it that it was basically distracting from the show.Which is really a shame too, because the story itself is excellent. It follows the story of a series of woman, all looking to compete in a kind of tournament to elect one of them as the next queen of the nation. Each person has their own reasons for fighting, and although the tournaments only officially start in the final episode, matches can be held in route to knock out potential competition.I was a little confused regarding the mechanics of the matches, since losing a match does not seem to disqualify someone from competing again. In fact, the main character is constantly getting her butt handed to her. It is actually pretty silly, as her character keeps getting beat over and over again but never gives up. It is also a little confusing as to who is participating and why. The main character insisted that she wasn't going to participate numerous times yet kept doing things to show that she was going to participate.Anyway, the story was pretty decent, consisting of a fair amount of fun, including an angel that champions the matches continually doing unangelic things. The fighting is OK and the story tends to flow pretty well with each of the characters stories. The end of this series does not end the show, as it is ongoing battle.The biggest thing that annoyed me was the ridiculous amount of fan service. Every character except one wore exceptionally revealing and impractical clothing. For example, one character wore a snake as her underwear. The only thing covering her lower half of her body was a snake wrapped around her nether regions, and she frequently sent the snake away for errands, leaving her completely naked. Other character wear things things that barely cover their chests, including a demon with a second pair of hands that cover her breasts least she want to squirt acidic breast milk at them (yes, this is the basis of several episodes).And that doesn't even touch on the nudity. EVERY fight scene consists of at least one characters clothing being ripped off. There is not a single fight scene that does not have someone's breast bare by the end of it. It is laughably ridiculous. That is where I feel the show fails. Even when they are trying to do serious scenes, everyone is either naked or wearing clothing that might as well make them naked, so it is so ridiculous that it is unbelievable, making what should be powerful emotional scenes a joke.Had they cut the fan service back a couple clicks, this show is pretty good and has the capacity to be a great anime, but like others have mentioned, the sheer amount of fan service is distracting.",3,Interesting,1318636800,"10 15, 2011",2011,2841,"['honestly', 'first', 'anime', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'fan', 'service', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'wrong', 'fan', 'service', 'normally', 'show', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'basically', 'distracting', 'show.Which', 'really', 'shame', 'too', 'story', 'excellent', 'story', 'series', 'woman', 'looking', 'compete', 'kind', 'tournament', 'elect', 'one', 'next', 'queen', 'nation', 'person', 'own', 'reasons', 'fighting', 'tournaments', 'only', 'officially', 'start', 'final', 'episode', 'matches', 'can', 'be', 'held', 'route', 'knock', 'out', 'potential', 'competition.I', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'regarding', 'mechanics', 'matches', 'losing', 'match', 'not', 'seem', 'disqualify', 'someone', 'competing', 'again', 'fact', 'main', 'character', 'constantly', 'getting', 'butt', 'handed', 'actually', 'pretty', 'silly', 'character', 'getting', 'beat', 'over', 'again', 'never', 'up', 'also', 'little', 'confusing', 'who', 'participating', 'why', 'main', 'character', 'insisted', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'participate', 'numerous', 'times', 'yet', 'kept', 'doing', 'things', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'participate.Anyway', 'story', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'consisting', 'fair', 'amount', 'fun', 'including', 'angel', 'matches', 'continually', 'doing', 'unangelic', 'things', 'fighting', 'OK', 'story', 'flow', 'pretty', 'well', 'characters', 'stories', 'end', 'series', 'not', 'end', 'show', 'ongoing', 'battle.The', 'biggest', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'amount', 'fan', 'service', 'Every', 'character', 'one', 'exceptionally', 'revealing', 'impractical', 'clothing', 'example', 'one', 'character', 'wore', 'snake', 'underwear', 'only', 'thing', 'covering', 'lower', 'half', 'body', 'was', 'snake', 'wrapped', 'nether', 'regions', 'frequently', 'sent', 'snake', 'away', 'errands', 'leaving', 'completely', 'naked', 'Other', 'character', 'wear', 'things', 'things', 'barely', 'cover', 'chests', 'including', 'demon', 'second', 'pair', 'hands', 'cover', 'breasts', 'least', 'want', 'squirt', 'acidic', 'breast', 'milk', 'yes', 'basis', 'several', 'episodes', '.And', ""n't"", 'even', 'touch', 'nudity', 'EVERY', 'fight', 'scene', 'least', 'one', 'characters', 'clothing', 'being', 'ripped', 'off', 'not', 'single', 'fight', 'scene', 'not', 'have', 'someone', 'breast', 'bare', 'end', 'laughably', 'ridiculous', 'where', 'feel', 'show', 'Even', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'do', 'serious', 'scenes', 'everyone', 'naked', 'wearing', 'clothing', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'naked', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'unbelievable', 'making', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'joke.Had', 'cut', 'fan', 'service', 'back', 'couple', 'clicks', 'show', 'pretty', 'good', 'capacity', 'be', 'great', 'anime', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'sheer', 'amount', 'fan', 'service', 'distracting']",Queen's Blade: The Exiled Virgin Collection

Women warriors complete in sanctioned battle watched over by an angels to determine who would be the most worthy to be the queen.  The story, while having a large cast of characters, seem to focus on two fighters, Leena a noble daughter who wishes to make her own way in the world, and Tomoe a warrior priestess who is fighting to save her country from corruption and to avenge her fallen sisterhood.  As the two warriors travel to Gynos (no comment), the capital city they will meet other fighters and have many experiences.  But in the shadows the Swamp Witch and her minions strive to destroy the Queens Blade and rule over all.While there is very strong fan service in this series, and very strong innuendo (definately not for kids), it does have a well written story which gives you a good background of the people and the world they are in, and a well developed cast of characters (and I mean they each have a good backstories)and you actually have a good first season.  It was well dubbed and and there are 12 episodes with 6 ovas, bringing the total to 18 episodes (the OVAS are like Kohime Muso where the characters are resurrected in a 20th century high school setting)  And with the second season first disk coming out in may I actually am looking forward to seeing how the tournament progresses.Till next time",5,FINALLY IT IS OUT,1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,1758,"['Okay', 'know', 'header', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'indicator', 'show', 'when', 'ordered', 'series', 'October', 'pushed', 'back', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'Duke', 'Nukem', 'game', 'Yes', 'know', 'coimg', 'out', '6/14', 'posting', 'will', 'believe', 'when', 'see', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'FINALLY', 'story', 'world', 'where', '4', 'years', 'tournament', 'held', 'determine', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'powerful', 'gorgeous', 'queen', 'Women', 'warriors', 'complete', 'sanctioned', 'battle', 'watched', 'over', 'angels', 'determine', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'worthy', 'be', 'queen', 'story', 'having', 'large', 'cast', 'characters', 'seem', 'focus', 'two', 'fighters', 'Leena', 'noble', 'daughter', 'who', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'world', 'Tomoe', 'warrior', 'priestess', 'who', 'fighting', 'save', 'country', 'corruption', 'avenge', 'fallen', 'sisterhood', 'two', 'warriors', 'travel', 'Gynos', 'comment', 'capital', 'city', 'will', 'meet', 'other', 'fighters', 'have', 'many', 'experiences', 'shadows', 'Swamp', 'Witch', 'minions', 'strive', 'destroy', 'Queens', 'Blade', 'rule', 'very', 'strong', 'fan', 'service', 'series', 'very', 'strong', 'innuendo', 'definately', 'not', 'kids', 'have', 'well', 'written', 'story', 'good', 'background', 'people', 'world', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'cast', 'characters', 'mean', 'have', 'good', 'backstories', 'actually', 'have', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'well', 'dubbed', 'are', '12', 'episodes', '6', 'ovas', 'bringing', 'total', '18', 'episodes', 'OVAS', 'are', 'Kohime', 'Muso', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'resurrected', '20th', 'century', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'disk', 'coming', 'out', 'may', 'actually', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'how', 'tournament', 'progresses.Till', 'next', 'time']",Queen's Blade: The Exiled Virgin Collection

1385814,A182VTJIIEVM37,B0045O2PH8,GintaxAlvissforever,"[0, 0]","I feel like this is an action series done right in terms of having a lot of fanservice while still having a plot that doesn't get derailed because of the fanservice UNLIKE KAMPFER.The story is generic though. Every few years, the angels allow a tournament called the Queen's Blade to happen on the continent where only the strongest woman can compete (as long as they're over 13) and the one who wins ends up the ruler of the continent.The second daughter of the great king Vance who is set to be the next ruler Leina tries to run away from home only to get attacked by a demon named Melonna and saved by the bandit Risty. After getting attacked again, she runs away again to participate despite failing to demonstrate her self worth.Leina in season 1 I'll admit is pretty useless for a protagonist always needing saving or always losing despite her resolve (but it shows how weak she is and not fit for the tournament that her mother participated in). Her other two sisters Claudette and Elina go after their sister to get her back home and prevent a feud from breaking out.This is one side of the story. Each character Leina meets has their reason for being the tournament. In a place that might as well being Japan, priestess Tomoyo arrives on the continent with her bodyguard Shizuka to win in order to get rid of Mikado that have become corrupt and restore her country to its former glory which is very noble of her and you route for Tomoyo despite her being secondary character because her reason is shown in her introduction why she must win.Other characters include Nowa who is kicked out of the elf village because of being a half breed to participate because of discrimination. Nowa thinks if she were to win, she would be accepted by her elf peers beside her teacher Alleyne, a full blooded elf who ends up in the tournament in order to watch over her student.Then there is Cattleya the blacksmith and Ymir the dwarf. Cattleya joins the tournament in order to find her husband who disappeared years ago leaving her to take care of her son Rana. Ymir joins to prove that dwarf weapons aren't useless and to save the dwarfs from going out of business.Overall everyone has a reason to be in the tournament and as a result, they all have a good backstory and makes them all likable characters (and Leina comes off as shallow in comparison).The action in season 1 is actually small compared to season 2 and 3 but it's enough to get the point across. Given there are so many characters, season 1 is focused on introducing everyone (and season 1 is NOT the tournament arc despite the summary). Alas there is a lot of fanservice and each girl has their own fetish as a result. Alleyne despite being a serious elf does not wear any underwear and has a leaf protecting her private area while Nowa doesn't wear anything at all. Melonna is just a blob of fanservice and Cattleya has the biggest boobs in anime history (and only Nanael jokes about the size of the breasts of the characters effectively breaking the 4th wall).Speaking of characters, the one I felt that stood out the most was the angel Nanael who is in charge of hosting the Queen's Blade tournaments. She's a screw up and she knows it but she hides it behind her huge ego that angels shouldn't have. You only find out in the episode dedicated to her on WHY she's has superiority inferiority complex (I'll just say that the angel race as a whole are a bunch of hypocrites who hide behind their kind personality but are just as petty as humans and only Nanael openly shows it but that doesn't make her a hypocrite at all as a result and gets her isolated from the other angels along with the fact that she has one small wing and one big wing).So if you have the money, I would buy it, but the plot seriously won't pick up until season 2. -_-",4,A Surprisingly Good Action Series With Good Fanservice,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,3804,"['feel', 'action', 'series', 'done', 'right', 'terms', 'having', 'lot', 'fanservice', 'still', 'having', 'plot', ""n't"", 'get', 'derailed', 'fanservice', 'UNLIKE', 'KAMPFER.The', 'story', 'generic', 'Every', 'few', 'years', 'angels', 'allow', 'tournament', 'called', 'Queen', 'Blade', 'happen', 'continent', 'where', 'only', 'strongest', 'woman', 'can', 'compete', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", '13', 'one', 'who', 'up', 'ruler', 'continent.The', 'second', 'daughter', 'great', 'king', 'Vance', 'who', 'set', 'be', 'next', 'ruler', 'Leina', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'only', 'get', 'attacked', 'demon', 'named', 'Melonna', 'saved', 'bandit', 'Risty', 'getting', 'attacked', 'again', 'away', 'again', 'participate', 'failing', 'demonstrate', 'self', 'worth.Leina', 'season', '1', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'pretty', 'useless', 'protagonist', 'always', 'needing', 'saving', 'always', 'losing', 'resolve', 'how', 'weak', 'not', 'fit', 'tournament', 'mother', 'participated', 'other', 'two', 'sisters', 'Claudette', 'Elina', 'go', 'sister', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'prevent', 'feud', 'breaking', 'out.This', 'one', 'side', 'story', 'character', 'Leina', 'meets', 'reason', 'being', 'tournament', 'place', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'Japan', 'priestess', 'Tomoyo', 'continent', 'bodyguard', 'Shizuka', 'win', 'order', 'get', 'rid', 'Mikado', 'have', 'become', 'corrupt', 'restore', 'country', 'former', 'glory', 'very', 'noble', 'route', 'Tomoyo', 'being', 'secondary', 'character', 'reason', 'shown', 'introduction', 'why', 'must', 'win.Other', 'characters', 'include', 'Nowa', 'who', 'kicked', 'elf', 'village', 'being', 'half', 'breed', 'participate', 'discrimination', 'Nowa', 'were', 'win', 'would', 'be', 'accepted', 'elf', 'peers', 'teacher', 'Alleyne', 'full', 'blooded', 'elf', 'who', 'up', 'tournament', 'order', 'watch', 'student.Then', 'Cattleya', 'blacksmith', 'Ymir', 'dwarf', 'Cattleya', 'tournament', 'order', 'find', 'husband', 'who', 'disappeared', 'years', 'ago', 'leaving', 'take', 'care', 'son', 'Rana', 'Ymir', 'prove', 'dwarf', 'weapons', 'are', ""n't"", 'useless', 'save', 'dwarfs', 'going', 'business.Overall', 'everyone', 'reason', 'be', 'tournament', 'result', 'have', 'good', 'backstory', 'likable', 'characters', 'Leina', 'off', 'shallow', 'comparison', 'action', 'season', '1', 'actually', 'small', 'compared', 'season', '2', '3', 'enough', 'get', 'point', 'Given', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'season', '1', 'focused', 'introducing', 'everyone', 'season', '1', 'NOT', 'tournament', 'summary', 'Alas', 'lot', 'fanservice', 'girl', 'own', 'fetish', 'result', 'Alleyne', 'being', 'serious', 'elf', 'not', 'wear', 'underwear', 'leaf', 'protecting', 'private', 'area', 'Nowa', ""n't"", 'wear', 'anything', 'Melonna', 'just', 'blob', 'fanservice', 'Cattleya', 'biggest', 'boobs', 'anime', 'history', 'only', 'Nanael', 'jokes', 'size', 'breasts', 'characters', 'effectively', 'breaking', '4th', 'wall', '.Speaking', 'characters', 'one', 'felt', 'stood', 'out', 'most', 'was', 'angel', 'Nanael', 'who', 'charge', 'hosting', 'Queen', 'Blade', 'tournaments', 'screw', 'up', 'huge', 'ego', 'angels', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'episode', 'dedicated', 'WHY', 'superiority', 'inferiority', 'complex', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'angel', 'race', 'whole', 'are', 'bunch', 'hypocrites', 'who', 'hide', 'kind', 'personality', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'petty', 'humans', 'only', 'Nanael', 'openly', ""n't"", 'make', 'hypocrite', 'result', 'isolated', 'other', 'angels', 'fact', 'one', 'small', 'wing', 'one', 'big', 'wing', '.So', 'have', 'money', 'would', 'buy', 'plot', 'seriously', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'season', '2', '-_-']",Queen's Blade: The Exiled Virgin Collection

The tournament is held to determine the strongest and most beautiful woman of all. I fail to see how the 2 are connected, but who cares. The young heiress, Leina, is caught up in the tournament while trying to escape from her controlling father. The are also many other women who are traveling to compete in the tournament. It has a very fantasy/adventure setting to it. There are lots of very beautiful and colorful characters. It's about as wild as an anime can get, without being called hentai.This anime has a weak story, like Ikki Tousen or Tenjho Tenge. The difference is the quality. This series has top notch animation. Many anime's like this, that have no point other than naked chicks fighting, are also sloppily done. Queen's Blade looks like the people making it cared about quality. The voice acting is also pretty good. That's another uncharacteristic thing about this type of show. Queens's Blade is probably the best that I've seen from this genre. All that being said, there is no story to become engrossed in. You can pretty much turn the TV on mute and not miss anything. Nothing happens. It's just chicks fondling eachother and getting it on while they fight. That is definitely fun to see, but if you expect a story, you will be disappointed.

The first couple of episodes are a bit mature in terms of violence, including one episode where almost everyone but the main characters die.

1385820,A1N2E1GTHUSG7P,B0045O2PH8,Ryoko's Husband,"[7, 28]","Greetings;I remember, back, a while ago...End of January or so I think it was in 2011 that I first day the pre-order for this collection, the first season of Queens Blade on dvd. I gave it a little time, then bought it-pre-ordered it that is. Well, I waited and waited and waited some more as the release date wasn't so much pushed back as the product listing itself seems to have been completly removed from amazon altogether. Which is why I have had to choose to write this review over the blu-ray edition, no offense. I won't pretend to understand the reasons for any of this, but I do know that today, April 12, 2011, I finally received it. I don't know how many other people have also gotten theirs, if any of the others who may have pre-ordered it elected to retain their pre-order status in favor of cancelling it altogether. But I choose to wait.I know that in some cases, dvd releases have been done one by one, such as this series had been, three to make a collection. I know that in some cases, originally, the shows have been only released in Japanese and the collection sets have been stalled up as they are dubbed in english. Kanokon, I beleive had this problem, you can find the dual language set, but its virtually impossible to find the some 4 volumes to make it-the listing for volume 1, which I have in fact, has been removed from amazon for some reason. But Queens Blade has always been a dual language to my knowledge, so I can not say as to why it has been experiencing this problem. Maybe it has something to do with the three original volumes selling for about $30 apiece and I bought the collection for $35? Greed maybe, but who knows.Three disks in a flip case, no inserts inside the case, no flyers for other releases, no post cards to order from the Anime Works company that produced it, rather like the Kanokon set I must say. Lazy perhaps, though I don't really care about all that. The special features included appear to be just the same for the individual volumes as well. Episodes 1-12, six OVA episodes, textless openings and special ending, TV spots, Textless endings for the Leina, Tomoe and Nanael characters voice actor interviews and the Tokyo Anime Fair Event that it had been shown at some time ago. Only really care about the OVA episodes, but still, I imagine all the extras were meant to help soften the blow of having originally spent close to $90 to get the whole set whereas you can get it for $35, maybe. Depends on if you can actually find it I suppose. Maybe someone working with amazon could explain it. Mine arrived from Chicago in an envelope instead of the usual boxes you see amazon shipments come in and the invoice slip was bent and torn, not that I cared so much, but it does make me wonder if perhaps someone wasn't happy about having to complete the order...Again, I will leave you to wonder that.Thank you and take care...",5,"Well, honestly, I didn't actually...",1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,2884,"['Greetings', 'remember', 'back', 'while', 'ago', 'End', 'January', 'so', 'think', 'was', '2011', 'first', 'day', 'pre-order', 'collection', 'first', 'season', 'Queens', 'Blade', 'dvd', 'gave', 'little', 'time', 'then', 'bought', 'it-pre-ordered', 'Well', 'waited', 'waited', 'waited', 'more', 'release', 'date', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'pushed', 'back', 'product', 'listing', 'have', 'been', 'completly', 'removed', 'amazon', 'altogether', 'Which', 'why', 'have', 'had', 'choose', 'write', 'review', 'blu-ray', 'edition', 'offense', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'understand', 'reasons', 'do', 'know', 'today', 'April', '12', '2011', 'finally', 'received', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'also', 'gotten', 'others', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'pre-ordered', 'elected', 'retain', 'pre-order', 'status', 'favor', 'cancelling', 'altogether', 'choose', 'wait.I', 'know', 'cases', 'dvd', 'releases', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'one', 'one', 'such', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'three', 'make', 'collection', 'know', 'cases', 'originally', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'released', 'Japanese', 'collection', 'sets', 'have', 'been', 'stalled', 'up', 'are', 'dubbed', 'english', 'Kanokon', 'beleive', 'had', 'problem', 'can', 'find', 'dual', 'language', 'set', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'find', '4', 'volumes', 'make', 'it-the', 'listing', 'volume', '1', 'have', 'fact', 'been', 'removed', 'amazon', 'reason', 'Queens', 'Blade', 'always', 'been', 'dual', 'language', 'knowledge', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'why', 'been', 'experiencing', 'problem', 'Maybe', 'something', 'do', 'three', 'original', 'volumes', 'selling', '30', 'apiece', 'bought', 'collection', '35', 'Greed', 'maybe', 'who', 'knows.Three', 'disks', 'flip', 'case', 'inserts', 'case', 'flyers', 'other', 'releases', 'post', 'cards', 'order', 'Anime', 'Works', 'company', 'produced', 'rather', 'Kanokon', 'set', 'must', 'say', 'Lazy', 'perhaps', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'appear', 'be', 'just', 'same', 'individual', 'volumes', 'as', 'well', 'Episodes', '1-12', 'six', 'OVA', 'episodes', 'textless', 'openings', 'special', 'ending', 'TV', 'spots', 'Textless', 'endings', 'Leina', 'Tomoe', 'Nanael', 'characters', 'voice', 'actor', 'interviews', 'Tokyo', 'Anime', 'Fair', 'Event', 'had', 'been', 'shown', 'time', 'ago', 'Only', 'really', 'care', 'OVA', 'episodes', 'still', 'imagine', 'extras', 'were', 'meant', 'help', 'soften', 'blow', 'having', 'originally', 'spent', 'close', '90', 'get', 'whole', 'set', 'can', 'get', '35', 'maybe', 'can', 'actually', 'find', 'suppose', 'Maybe', 'someone', 'working', 'amazon', 'could', 'explain', 'Mine', 'arrived', 'Chicago', 'envelope', 'instead', 'usual', 'boxes', 'see', 'amazon', 'shipments', 'come', 'invoice', 'slip', 'was', 'bent', 'torn', 'not', 'cared', 'so', 'much', 'make', 'wonder', 'perhaps', 'someone', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'having', 'complete', 'order', 'Again', 'will', 'leave', 'wonder', 'that.Thank', 'take', 'care']",Queen's Blade: The Exiled Virgin Collection
