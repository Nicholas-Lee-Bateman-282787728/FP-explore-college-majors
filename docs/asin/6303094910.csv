355706,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,6303094910,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[5, 5]","This is one of the most horrifying, heartbreaking stories I have ever seen. There are a lot of reviewers here who contest the authenticity of the storyline, but even if what is depicted is even remotely true, here is a life that no-one deserves.I don't agree with a lot of what Jessica Lange has to say, current issues, political views and such, but I have tremendous respect for her acting ability. Her portrayal of an unbalanced, threatened, hounded woman, is without peer. In this film, she portrays the film star Frances Farmer, showing a very controversial, headstrong woman, a no-no in the day of Farmer's rise and fall. Attacking a hairdresser, being pulled over by the police, then attacking a police officer, and being convicted of Contempt of Court, yes, she needed to learn a lesson. But people in authority don't like people who make waves.The story follows her life, so to speak, through some rough times, some happier times, and, what I would call one of the saddest, most frustrating, completely horrifying things to happen to somebody. She's happy, she knows what she wants, and is ready to begin anew, without Hollyweird. The typical stage-mother sees this as a bad idea, and a fight ensues. Since she was stripped of her legal rights as an adult, her mother's decisions count, not hers, and in one of the most vicious things one could do to another person, commits Frances to a mental intstitution a second time. Seeing her sitting there, remembering her life when it was better, in a crowded mental infirmary, surrounded with the dregs of society, drugged, hair chopped off, restrained, tied down and raped, this is an excruciating scene to watch. As with the Ice-Pick Lobotomy. Detractors of this film say this didn't happen to her, but it DOES happen. Or, at the very least, it did happen to people. Like an earlier scene, where the doctors strapped her to a bed, and injected her full of Insulin, telling her it was a tranquilizer. Watching convulsions isn't a pleasant experience, and having one, I can't imagine.The written narration at the end of the film says, ""She died as she lived: Alone.""Yes, this is one brutal film, one that can leave a viewer exhausted, physically, as well as emotionally, and will stay with you for a very long time, knowing how people tend to treat someone who is a little ""different.""",5,"Disturbing, in every sense",1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,2337,"['one', 'most', 'horrifying', 'heartbreaking', 'stories', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'here', 'who', 'contest', 'authenticity', 'storyline', 'even', 'what', 'depicted', 'even', 'remotely', 'true', 'here', 'life', 'no-one', 'deserves.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'lot', 'what', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'say', 'current', 'issues', 'political', 'views', 'such', 'have', 'tremendous', 'respect', 'acting', 'ability', 'portrayal', 'unbalanced', 'threatened', 'hounded', 'woman', 'peer', 'film', 'film', 'star', 'Frances', 'Farmer', 'showing', 'very', 'controversial', 'headstrong', 'woman', 'no-no', 'day', 'Farmer', 'rise', 'fall', 'Attacking', 'hairdresser', 'being', 'pulled', 'over', 'police', 'then', 'attacking', 'police', 'officer', 'being', 'convicted', 'Contempt', 'Court', 'yes', 'needed', 'learn', 'lesson', 'people', 'authority', 'do', ""n't"", 'people', 'who', 'make', 'waves.The', 'story', 'life', 'so', 'speak', 'rough', 'times', 'happier', 'times', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'one', 'saddest', 'most', 'frustrating', 'completely', 'horrifying', 'things', 'happen', 'somebody', 'happy', 'what', 'ready', 'begin', 'anew', 'Hollyweird', 'typical', 'stage-mother', 'sees', 'bad', 'idea', 'fight', 'ensues', 'was', 'stripped', 'legal', 'rights', 'adult', 'mother', 'decisions', 'count', 'not', 'hers', 'one', 'most', 'vicious', 'things', 'one', 'could', 'do', 'person', 'commits', 'Frances', 'mental', 'intstitution', 'second', 'time', 'Seeing', 'sitting', 'there', 'remembering', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'better', 'crowded', 'mental', 'infirmary', 'surrounded', 'dregs', 'society', 'drugged', 'hair', 'chopped', 'off', 'restrained', 'tied', 'down', 'raped', 'excruciating', 'scene', 'watch', 'Ice-Pick', 'Lobotomy', 'Detractors', 'film', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'DOES', 'happen', 'very', 'least', 'did', 'happen', 'people', 'earlier', 'scene', 'where', 'doctors', 'strapped', 'bed', 'injected', 'full', 'Insulin', 'telling', 'was', 'tranquilizer', 'Watching', 'convulsions', ""n't"", 'pleasant', 'experience', 'having', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine.The', 'written', 'narration', 'end', 'film', 'died', 'lived', 'Alone', 'Yes', 'one', 'brutal', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'leave', 'viewer', 'exhausted', 'physically', 'as', 'well', 'emotionally', 'will', 'stay', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'knowing', 'how', 'people', 'tend', 'treat', 'someone', 'who', 'little', 'different']",N/A

355709,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,6303094910,Alistair McHarg,"[9, 12]","At its core, this is a film about what happens when a person defies the system, any system.  It is the true story of Frances Farmer, a beautiful, smart, and rebellious movie star of the `30s who seemed to have it all.  Because of her many advantages the system took a while catching up to her; maybe that's where the fury and vengeance originated.  Payback required more than a pound of flesh, the system wanted her spirit, her intellect, and her soul.  The portrayal of psychiatry as practiced in those days is unlike anything you will see anywhere else, it makes Cuckoo's Nest look like a vacation in Tuscany.  Indeed, psychiatry in this film is less a healing force than a means of preserving social order and conformity.Jessica Lange deserved the Oscar for this role, that she didn't get it is a crime.  This is a solo masterpiece performance easily on a par with Streep in Sophie's Choice.  Lange has the beauty, intelligence, sophistication, and edge to play this complicated woman, and she throws herself into the part fearlessly.  From saucy starlet oozing coy charm, to radical intellectual hanging with lefties in NYC, to belligerent scrapper knocking heads with studio moguls, to star-crossed lover inviting disaster and betrayal the way others invite friends over to dinner, to self-destructive victim descending into the darkness of booze and pills, to adult infant manipulated by a fiercely controlling mother, to psychiatric patient - abused for sport and disassembled; Lange shifts through facets like she's driving a Porsche on a country road, you never notice her changing gears, every minute of the ride is thrilling.The best thing about this film, apart from Lange, is that is shows, it doesn't tell.  The viewer is left to interpret without heavy-handed moralizing.  The truth of Frances Farmer's life is so fascinating and bizarre that simply bringing it to the screen is more than enough.  Few of us have had the experience of being involuntarily committed to a mental hospital - much less lobotomized - but all of us have tried to thwart the system at one point or another and paid for it.  Every viewer can applaud Farmer's irreverence and idealism, even when it's naive, and feel sorrow when she must confront the cruel consequences.This is a dark movie, not all Hollywood lives have happy endings, but it is a true movie.  Frances takes you places you have never gone and can barely imagine; Jessica Lange delivers the performance of lifetime - not just her lifetime, anybody's lifetime.",5,"The Intersection Of Film, Fact, And Genius - Unforgettable",1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,2514,"['core', 'film', 'what', 'when', 'person', 'system', 'system', 'true', 'story', 'Frances', 'Farmer', 'beautiful', 'smart', 'rebellious', 'movie', 'star', '30s', 'who', 'seemed', 'have', 'many', 'advantages', 'system', 'took', 'while', 'catching', 'up', 'where', 'fury', 'vengeance', 'originated', 'Payback', 'required', 'more', 'pound', 'flesh', 'system', 'wanted', 'spirit', 'intellect', 'soul', 'portrayal', 'psychiatry', 'practiced', 'days', 'anything', 'will', 'see', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'look', 'vacation', 'Tuscany', 'Indeed', 'psychiatry', 'film', 'less', 'healing', 'force', 'means', 'preserving', 'social', 'order', 'conformity.Jessica', 'Lange', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'crime', 'solo', 'masterpiece', 'performance', 'easily', 'par', 'Streep', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'Lange', 'beauty', 'intelligence', 'sophistication', 'edge', 'play', 'complicated', 'woman', 'part', 'fearlessly', 'saucy', 'starlet', 'oozing', 'coy', 'charm', 'radical', 'intellectual', 'hanging', 'lefties', 'NYC', 'belligerent', 'scrapper', 'knocking', 'heads', 'studio', 'moguls', 'star-crossed', 'lover', 'inviting', 'disaster', 'betrayal', 'way', 'others', 'invite', 'friends', 'dinner', 'self-destructive', 'victim', 'descending', 'darkness', 'booze', 'pills', 'adult', 'infant', 'manipulated', 'fiercely', 'controlling', 'mother', 'psychiatric', 'patient', 'abused', 'sport', 'disassembled', 'Lange', 'shifts', 'facets', 'driving', 'Porsche', 'country', 'road', 'never', 'notice', 'changing', 'gears', 'minute', 'ride', 'thrilling.The', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'apart', 'Lange', 'shows', ""n't"", 'tell', 'viewer', 'left', 'interpret', 'heavy-handed', 'moralizing', 'truth', 'Frances', 'Farmer', 'life', 'so', 'fascinating', 'bizarre', 'simply', 'bringing', 'screen', 'more', 'enough', 'Few', 'have', 'had', 'experience', 'being', 'involuntarily', 'committed', 'mental', 'hospital', 'much', 'less', 'lobotomized', 'have', 'tried', 'thwart', 'system', 'one', 'point', 'paid', 'viewer', 'can', 'applaud', 'Farmer', 'irreverence', 'idealism', 'even', 'when', 'naive', 'feel', 'sorrow', 'when', 'must', 'confront', 'cruel', 'consequences.This', 'dark', 'movie', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'lives', 'have', 'happy', 'endings', 'true', 'movie', 'Frances', 'places', 'have', 'never', 'gone', 'can', 'barely', 'imagine', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'not', 'just', 'lifetime', 'anybody', 'lifetime']",N/A
355710,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303094910,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Some friends of mine have, for some time now, been insisting that I sit down and watch `Frances'.  I am not the biggest Jessica Lange fan but they all rave this particular performance as one of the best in the history of film.  For me, and most of the known world, 1982 has always been about Meryl Streep and her heartbreaking performance in `Sophie's Choice' and I just couldn't fathom someone taking that away.Jessica Lange just did.While the film itself needed a lot of work, there is no denying that Jessica Lange is utterly incredible as the free spirited Frances Farmer.  With a fierceness that was needed to control all the chaos surrounding this character, Lange sinks her teeth into every scene with a commanding presence and a confidence that breathes a reality into this tormented soul.  Every outburst, every breakdown, every sarcastic comment is delivered with an honesty that just blew me away.  I love Streep (and I even utterly adore Julie Andrews that very same year) but after witnessing Lange I don't think 1982 will ever be the same for me.She is unrivaled!With all the heaps of praise for Lange, I must digress and point a few fingers now.  The film itself, which claims to be a true story (Frances Farmer was a real actress back in the 30's and 40's), is highly fictionalized.  I know that this is probably due to the fact that not much of the reality of Farmer's life was known at the time she was living and wild reports were circulating about every move she made.  I don't know if it was an intentional move on the part of the studio to kind of create a hodgepodge of truth and fiction here, but in the end I felt as if the film's dishonesty took away from the honesty that surrounded the real Frances Farmer.  She was an unbridled spirit, a woman who was labeled insane because she refused to back down from her convictions.  A woman with that strength deserved a film that respected her stance a little more.  The film seemed to play too heavily on the side of exploitation, which was the one thing that killed her soul in the first place.  By creating a fictional love interest and then focusing on him as apposed to the real meaty relationship (that of her fame obsessed mother), the film missed a lot of key opportunities to shed some much needed light on what made Frances the woman she became.  Her mother wound up nothing more than a caricature, which was sad since I'm truly interested in that motherly dynamic.Frances Farmer's life was a struggle.  It was filled with heartbreak and turmoil.  She was a victim of a ruthless system that disregarded her because she refused to fit into their mold.  They attacked her and reprimanded her and tried to repress her.  Through it all she maintained her determination to never conform.In the end I highly recommend this film.  I'd give it a B-.  Despite the films apparent flaws, it still works thanks in large part to Jessica Lange.  She is a beacon to honest light in a film that doesn't seem to know if it wants to play it straight or not.  I felt at times like the mood of the film was very `Lifetime Movie of the Week' and then again, there were moments of really expertly crafted tension (the stairwell confrontation scene with her mother felt like a moment out of `Misery').

355717,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6303094910,Byron Kolln,"[4, 6]","Jessica Lange stars as Frances Farmer in this well-crafted film based on Farmer's novel ""Will There Really Be a Morning"".  Farmer's life recounts one of the darkest chapters in Hollywood history, as her strong political and personal ethics black- balled her career, and she eventually spent time in several mental institutions.  Farmer was definitely an actress ahead-of-her-time, refusing to bow to studio conventions and only starring in films she felt were right for her talents.  At the apex of her fame, she abandoned Tinseltown for the legitimate Broadway stage.  Unable and unwilling to indulge their temperamental star, Hollywood painted her as a madwoman...and Frances took the fall.Farmer's novel paints a harrowing portrait of her life living in a series of mental institutions.  Not for the weak-hearted, the novel describes in succinct detail the day-to-day life in a madhouse.  Though controversy does lie in the legitimacy of the book, with claims that it was Farmer's close friend Jean Ratcliffe who in fact wrote the bulk of it.  Farmer underwent a lobotomy operation at the conclusion of her final stint in care, before hosting her own syndicated talk show for several years.  Though whether Farmer indeed had the lobotomy is another debatable subject.Jessica Lange offers a very sympathetic performances as Frances, and should have won the Academy Award for it (she won the Oscar for TOOTSIE the same year).  Legendary star of stage and screen Kim Stanley plays Frances' crazed and possessive mother Lillian with all the raw human emotion she can muster.  The film stays pretty close to the facts, but the love-interest (played by Sam Shepard) is pure Hollywood fiction.  The other real star of the film is the haunting musical score by John Barry.

355718,A3JM17QHAJCOWD,6303094910,Catherine Gallanti,"[5, 5]","Frances is a powerful movie that tells the story of a very gifted, beautiful and smart actress falling apart as she struggles to fit into the Hollywood mold of her time. It is not quite clear if she is suffering from mental illness of if she is just overwheled with rage and frustration for which she has no outlet, but regardless, like used to happen and still does at times, she enters the world of the psychiatric hospital and gradually looses her freedom, her life and her mind (literally, in the sense that at some point in the movie she is lobotomized). As she endures all of this, we begin to understand that Frances has a very sick mother, that is probably more in need of psychiatric care than her daughter. The mother betrays her over and over, not allowing her to be her true self, denying her true needs and handling her over to the butchers at the psychiatric hospital whenever she feels that Frances may be slipping away from her control.This is a very sad and at times horrifying story. It may not be Frances Farmer's true story however, as it seems that she may have never had a lobotomy. Also it seems that she had a far bigger problem with alcoholism than was highlighted here. However, this does not detract from the movie, which tells a story that could have been true for many people of that era. Lobotomy and in particular the ""icepick"" style lobotomy was practiced liberally at the time by a variety of doctors and mental health practitioners, some of which did not even have any kind of surgical experience or license. Lobotomies of this kind , apparently were administered to war veterans struggling to adjust after the traumas they endured. Now they would be dignosed with PTSD and treated accordingly. Eventually lobotomy went out of fashion as it was seen for what it was: a barbaric practice that zombified people by robbing them of their essence, not a cure. I hope the same will be said soon of electroshock treatments, that, believe it or not are still used today. The history of the treatement of severe mental illness is rife with horror. In many ways we are still so very ignorant in these matters.This is not a movie for the faint of heart. However, it is an important movie in many ways.

355737,A3FGIDFZA4U3O2,6303094910,"Joan Crawford ""Jon""","[4, 5]","No other word could possibly describe this film than masterpiece. Almost any adjective would be an understatement, but I will try to describe here in words what is one of the greatest works of art ever created.It is no coincidence that of all the films I have seen, appreciated, and cared to review, only Frances and the 1937 version of Camille starring Greta Garbo share my opinion as being masterpieces. What makes Frances one of the best movies ever made? I could go on and on about Jessica Lange's brilliant, career-defining, tragic portrayal of the misunderstood heroine (which is at the very heart and soul of this film). I could describe in detail the wistful, beautiful, epic score or the powerful cinematography and supporting performances. At the very center of this film, however, is a genius screenplay. Perhaps long, weakly edited, but the lines and quotes - the unforgettable images, tragic love, and beauty conveyed in the words stand alone as a morally edifying, eye-opening, and cathartic work of drama. It was the reinvention, the renaissance of melodrama and it is dazzling.Lines will linger in your memory forever. Jessica Lange's immortal cry to Harry, ""Sometimes I wonder if anybody really loves anybody."" Or Lange's biting and true remark to the psychologist who takes away her freedom, ""Do you really think you know more about what goes on inside my head than I do?""Frances was a dreamer at heart...a brilliant nonconformist who paid the price of a society expecting everyone to be the same. She was punished because she was different...because she had a mind and a heart. She no longer had any rights as a person - as an individual.When Frances attempts to break away from the mold..from the Hollywood lifestyle that was ""killing"" her inside, her mother interferes and purposely has her committed to an asylum. Her only love - Harry - helps her escape, but by the end of the film we see it is too late for Frances to find happiness. Her life was stolen.The most emotionally stirring part of the film is when Frances receives the lobotomy.  We know she will never be the same dreamer that Harry fell in love with.  We know that she will never, in fact, be able to love again, having her emotional and imaginative abilities ""flattened"" by the procedure. And this is the tragedy and main point of Frances - no one has a right to take away these very basic, natural human freedoms. The right to love. The right to think for oneself and be an individual. As the movie shows, even parents - who are supposed to love unconditionally - may have motives of their own and be responsible for the emotional destruction of their children.The tragedy lies at the very end. Frances is, more than anything else, a love story. We remember Frances gazing out the small door window of the sanitarium, trying desperately to touch Harry - who we sense she deeply loves. And that is why she refuses to drag him down with her. In her mind, ""nobody can screw things up like I can."" And she can't let that happen to Harry, too, because he's the only thing that has ever been constant in her unstable life.When, at the end of the film, it becomes clear that Frances no longer has deep feelings for Harry (due to the lobotomy), we realize that society has taken away her greatest freedom of all--her freedom to love. And at this painful discovery, one can only weep for the tears Frances has inside but will never cry again.",5,One of the few masterpieces,1068854400,"11 15, 2003",2003,3422,"['other', 'word', 'could', 'possibly', 'describe', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'Almost', 'adjective', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'will', 'try', 'describe', 'here', 'words', 'what', 'one', 'greatest', 'works', 'art', 'ever', 'created.It', 'coincidence', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'appreciated', 'cared', 'review', 'only', 'Frances', '1937', 'version', 'Camille', 'starring', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'share', 'opinion', 'being', 'masterpieces', 'What', 'Frances', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'could', 'go', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'brilliant', 'career-defining', 'tragic', 'portrayal', 'misunderstood', 'heroine', 'very', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'could', 'describe', 'detail', 'wistful', 'beautiful', 'epic', 'score', 'powerful', 'cinematography', 'supporting', 'performances', 'very', 'center', 'film', 'however', 'genius', 'screenplay', 'Perhaps', 'long', 'weakly', 'edited', 'lines', 'unforgettable', 'images', 'tragic', 'love', 'beauty', 'conveyed', 'words', 'stand', 'alone', 'morally', 'edifying', 'eye-opening', 'cathartic', 'work', 'drama', 'was', 'reinvention', 'renaissance', 'melodrama', 'dazzling.Lines', 'will', 'linger', 'memory', 'forever', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'immortal', 'cry', 'Harry', 'Sometimes', 'wonder', 'anybody', 'really', 'anybody', 'Lange', 'biting', 'true', 'remark', 'psychologist', 'who', 'away', 'freedom', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'know', 'more', 'what', 'head', 'do', 'Frances', 'was', 'dreamer', 'heart', 'brilliant', 'nonconformist', 'who', 'paid', 'price', 'society', 'expecting', 'everyone', 'be', 'same', 'was', 'punished', 'was', 'different', 'had', 'mind', 'heart', 'no', 'longer', 'had', 'rights', 'person', 'individual.When', 'Frances', 'break', 'away', 'mold..from', 'Hollywood', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'killing', 'inside', 'mother', 'interferes', 'purposely', 'committed', 'asylum', 'only', 'love', 'Harry', 'escape', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'too', 'late', 'Frances', 'find', 'happiness', 'life', 'was', 'stolen.The', 'most', 'emotionally', 'stirring', 'part', 'film', 'when', 'Frances', 'lobotomy', 'know', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'dreamer', 'Harry', 'fell', 'love', 'know', 'will', 'never', 'fact', 'be', 'able', 'love', 'again', 'having', 'emotional', 'imaginative', 'abilities', 'flattened', 'procedure', 'tragedy', 'main', 'point', 'Frances', 'one', 'right', 'take', 'away', 'very', 'basic', 'natural', 'human', 'freedoms', 'right', 'love', 'right', 'think', 'be', 'individual', 'movie', 'even', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'love', 'unconditionally', 'may', 'have', 'motives', 'own', 'be', 'responsible', 'emotional', 'destruction', 'children.The', 'tragedy', 'very', 'end', 'Frances', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'love', 'story', 'remember', 'Frances', 'gazing', 'out', 'small', 'door', 'window', 'sanitarium', 'trying', 'desperately', 'touch', 'Harry', 'who', 'sense', 'loves', 'why', 'drag', 'down', 'mind', 'nobody', 'can', 'screw', 'things', 'can', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'happen', 'Harry', 'too', 'only', 'thing', 'ever', 'been', 'constant', 'unstable', 'life.When', 'end', 'film', 'clear', 'longer', 'deep', 'feelings', 'Harry', 'due', 'lobotomy', 'realize', 'society', 'taken', 'away', 'greatest', 'freedom', 'freedom', 'love', 'painful', 'discovery', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'weep', 'tears', 'Frances', 'inside', 'will', 'never', 'cry', 'again']",N/A

355744,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,6303094910,Marc Cabir Davis,"[1, 1]","'Frances' is, quite frankly, one of the most powerful films I have ever seen, and definitely one of the most compelling tales I have seen on film. I saw this movie 17 years after it was first released, but a story such as this loses none of its' power with time, and I was moved, touched and amazed at the life of Frances Farmer, upon whose life this film is based.First of all, let me say that I saw this on DVD. The DVD version of the movie is crystal clear, though the sound could have been sharper. Colors are crisp and vibrant, and the director's use of film in certain places to create a '30s effect is well-transferred. The only sore point is that there are no extra features on the DVD other than the scene selection. Perhaps a documentary on the star's life would have complimented the movie, but I'm not really complaining. That such an excellent film is available on DVD is gift enough.The life of Frances Farmer remains one of the most shrouded-in-secrecy tales to come out of Hollywood. Even her autobiography, it is said, was actually written by her 'best friend' Jean Ratcliffe, who doesn't even feature in the movie. I knew none of this when I first stumbled upon this film, which made the horror of the events it contained that much more gruesome and intolerable. For audiences who couldn't stomach 'Hannibal', I have news for you. 'Frances' is a film that deals with true horror, and for that reason this is a film that I will not see again. Itaffected me too much.The film starts with Frances' Seattle days, when she was a schoolgirl who won the essay contest with her stunning view of religion and necessity called 'God Dies'. Jessica Lange's version of the poem is gripping and sets the tone for the rest of the film. To be honest, Jessica Lange playing a 16 year old sounds unbelievable, but she pulls it off. Her transformation from schoolgirl to budding actress to tantrum-throwing firebrand is utterly compelling, and confirmed to me that she is indeed one of the best actresses we have in our company today.Frances Farmer, according to the movie, was hopelessly controlled by her mother, and to some extent, her soft-spoken father. The unspeakable horrors in this film include the selling of Frances to the mental institution by her mother, something that I could not quite get over. And yet, through it all, the film suggests that Frances is sane, and it is the rest of the world that views an uneven temperament as something that one should be punished for, or even worse, lobotomized. Much has been written of Farmer's supposed lobotomy, and the film insists that it did indeed happened. Farmer herself, in her later years, was known to have told her friends that it did not. Whatever the true story, it cannot be denied that the inhuman treatment that met this girl was shocking and condemnable.Jessica Lange is perhaps the only actress I have seen on film who has managed to tow the line between restrain and over-the-top so well, as she does here. Her scenes in the mental institution are breathtaking, because it reveals to us what true acting really consists of. Yet, at the same time, it seems as if Lange doesn't really act the part of Farmer. She IS Farmer, for all of the movie. This is at once both curious and remarkable, because no matter how hard I think, I cannot recall a single actress in a true-story adaptation who has managed to convince the audience that they ARE the person they are playing. Alas, Farmer's relationship with her mother, whom she keeps strangely going back to (proving that familial ties can sometimes be the noose around ones' neck) is where Lange hopelessly excels. These scenes are traumatic to sit through, and I must admit I had a tougher time sitting through this than I did during &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;.The fascinating thing about this movie is that it reminds us that there was nothing really wrong with Frances Farmer, other than her being an opinionated and strong-willed young woman, who wanted to take control of her own life. But in the '30s, this was blasphemy, at least to the circles that Farmer stemmed from. Jessica Lange's masterful potrayal of a woman torn between love for family, and love for ones' own sense of Self is something that I will not easily forget.The scenes in the mental asylum are the ones that are hardest to swallow. And to think that these events actually occured! Frances was repeatedly tortured, raped by orderlies and soldiers who were snuck in, and subject to eight hour stretches of hyrdrotherapy every day (something the film does not show, as it would have been way too graphic to handle). At the end of it, Frances Farmer spent seven years in the mental asylum for no apparent sin. The film does not portray her as a martyr or glorify her, which made me respect it as a body of work even more. It also hints that the lobotomy made Frances 'emotionally calmer', but Lange's subtle performance post-operation hints to us that there was serious emotional and physical damage done. The tilt of her head, the way her face shifts lower toward her neck and thrusts up in spasms every time she tries to talk - these are all signs that Frances Farmer was raped and mutilated from within, and would never again be the same person.Curiously, the movie does not deal with the years after Farmer's release from the hospital. Incredibly,she was supposed to have returned one last time to Hollywood and hosted her own TV show. Even her death was a mystery. Cancer of the oesophagus, it was said. Whatever the truth, we can safely say that Frances Farmer was one of Hollywoods' greatest victims, and a fine example that sometimes family can be the worst thing that happens to us.I strongly recommend this film to all lovers of drama and serious film-making. This deserved more recognition when it came out, and needs to be made more easily available. The DVD edition is in widescreen, with stereo sound. Easy scene access is the only additional feature.",5,On my Top Ten List,982022400,"02 13, 2001",2001,5960,"[""'Frances"", 'quite', 'frankly', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'films', 'have', 'ever',

355745,A1JLH6T4WAOPHY,6303094910,Marc Musnick,"[1, 1]","The film opens with a written narrative that it is based upon the life of Frances Farmer.  After doing some research on Farmer and her turbulent life, I found that the film takes many liberties with the troubled actress's life.  Most blatantly is the claim towards the film's end that Farmer, who suffered from mental illness most of her adult life, was given a lobotomy.  Witness's accounts, family input and medical records have disproved this theory.  There are other problems with the script's credibility.  Farmer was not an only child and the character of Harry York, who serves as the film's narrator, never existed.Nevertheless, the film is extremely powerful, well written and directed.  At the core of the film is the magnificent performance of Jessica Lange.  Probably with a touch of film magic, Lange's facial resemblance to Farmer is almost spooky.  Here's a performance of historical proportions.  Like Brando in ""On the Waterfront"", or more recently the late Heath Ledger in ""Brokeback Mountain"", for me this is one of those quintessential film performances that unfortunately happen infrequently.  Lange would have probably won the Oscar for best actress had Meryl Streep made ""Sophie's Choice"" earlier or later.  Also, Lange could have cancelled herself out by the historical nomination of not only best actress for ""Frances"" but also best supporting actress in ""Tootsie"".  As delightful as she was as the soap opera actress in ""Tootsie"" for which she won the award that year, as far as I'm concerned, both Streep and Lange could have tied for the best actress prize.  Lange is brilliant throughout.  Convincing as the teenage Farmer, the adult Farmer and finally the emotionally scared middle aged woman.In her last film role, Kim Stanley as Frances's possessive mother also gives an amazing performance.  Stanley has always been a favorite of mine.  I've marveled at her natural technique, that brilliant ability to appear as not acting.  She was one of the greatest actresses of her generation.Sam Sheppard is wonderful as the mythical Harry York who narrates the film.  His style is natural and he's almost unbelievably handsome in a very natural way.  It's a quiet performance that makes an indelible impression.John Barry's lush and beautiful score, as well as a piano sonata, underscore the film beautifully.  One of the best film scores ever written.Despite the inaccuracies of the film, which was more or less based upon the just as inaccurate book on Farmer's life ""Shadowland"", the film is rich with the atmosphere of  the 1930's Hollywood and Broadway atmosphere.  The art direction of the film stunning.The difficult subject matter of how mental illness was treated in the middle of the 20th century probably kept popular audiences away from the film.  But it became a hit as a video release and just as strong in its laser disk and DVD versions.Although the film is not an accurate account of it's subject's life, the career and emotional problems Farmer experienced are true and again, Lange's performance is a remarkable achievement.",5,Lange gives an unforgettable performance,1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,3067,"['film', 'written', 'narrative', 'based', 'life', 'Frances', 'Farmer', 'doing', 'research', 'Farmer', 'turbulent', 'life', 'found', 'film', 'many', 'liberties', 'troubled', 'actress', 'life', 'Most', 'blatantly', 'claim', 'film', 'end', 'Farmer', 'who', 'suffered', 'mental', 'illness', 'most', 'adult', 'life', 'was', 'given', 'lobotomy', 'Witness', 'accounts', 'family', 'input', 'medical', 'records', 'have', 'disproved', 'theory', 'are', 'other', 'problems', 'script', 'credibility', 'Farmer', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'child', 'character', 'Harry', 'York', 'who', 'film', 'narrator', 'never', 'existed.Nevertheless', 'film', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'core', 'film', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Probably', 'touch', 'film', 'magic', 'Lange', 'facial', 'resemblance', 'Farmer', 'almost', 'spooky', 'Here', 'performance', 'historical', 'proportions', 'Brando', 'Waterfront', 'more', 'recently', 'late', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'one', 'quintessential', 'film', 'performances', 'unfortunately', 'happen', 'infrequently', 'Lange', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'actress', 'had', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'made', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'earlier', 'later', 'Also', 'Lange', 'could', 'have', 'cancelled', 'out', 'historical', 'nomination', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'actress', 'Frances', 'also', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Tootsie', 'As', 'delightful', 'was', 'soap', 'opera', 'actress', 'Tootsie', 'won', 'award', 'year', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Streep', 'Lange', 'could', 'have', 'tied', 'best', 'actress', 'prize', 'Lange', 'brilliant', 'Convincing', 'teenage', 'Farmer', 'adult', 'Farmer', 'finally', 'emotionally', 'scared', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman.In', 'last', 'film', 'role', 'Kim', 'Stanley', 'Frances', 'possessive', 'mother', 'also', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Stanley', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', ""'ve"", 'marveled', 'natural', 'technique', 'brilliant', 'ability', 'appear', 'not', 'acting', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'actresses', 'generation.Sam', 'Sheppard', 'wonderful', 'mythical', 'Harry', 'York', 'who', 'film', 'style', 'natural', 'almost', 'unbelievably', 'handsome', 'very', 'natural', 'way', 'quiet', 'performance', 'indelible', 'impression.John', 'Barry', 'lush', 'beautiful', 'score', 'as', 'well', 'piano', 'sonata', 'film', 'beautifully', 'One', 'best', 'film', 'scores', 'ever', 'written.Despite', 'inaccuracies', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'based', 'just', 'inaccurate', 'book', 'Farmer', 'life', 'Shadowland', 'film', 'rich', 'atmosphere', '1930', 'Hollywood', 'Broadway', 'atmosphere', 'art', 'direction', 'film', 'stunning.The', 'difficult', 'subject', 'matter', 'how', 'mental', 'illness', 'was', 'treated', 'middle', '20th', 'century', 'probably', 'kept', 'popular', 'audiences', 'away', 'film', 'became', 'hit', 'video', 'release', 'just', 'strong', 'laser', 'disk', 'DVD', 'film', 'not', 'accurate', 'account', 'subject', 'life', 'career', 'emotional', 'problems', 'Farmer', 'experienced', 'are', 'true', 'again', 'Lange', 'performance', 'remarkable', 'achievement']",N/A

Jessica Lange's stunning performance as the troubled actress, Frances Farmer got a nod from the Academy in the best actress category in 1982, the first of the five nominations she received during 1980s. The story is largely based on Frances Farmer's auto biography, ""Will there be a Morning?"" and ""Hollywood Babylon"" by historian and author Kenneth Anger. The movie is pretty long, about 140 minutes, but skips the key portion of her life. In her book, she describes her ordeal in the state facilities for insane in great detail; the brutality of the caregivers, orderlies, and nurses, both physical and sexual, and lobotomies performed during those days of her incarceration is highly vivid and brutal.  The movie deals with this part very briefly. The circumstances of her arrest at the famous Knickerbocker Hotel in Hollywood, California and her subsequent demise as a Hollywood performer is well handled in the movie. Actress Kim Stanley also offers an outstanding performance as Mama Farmer, a highly controlling mother in the life of young Frances. Stanley was also nominated for Academy Award in the best supporting actress category.

There are a few people that know her story and occasionally refer to her (such as Nirvana did in one of their songs) and spark our interest in finding out more about her.  Finding information is a challenge because there are not a lot of books about Farmer and all of them are out of print.  The movie ""Frances"" gives us a chance to learn a little about her.""Frances"" is an amazing adaptation of the life of Frances Farmer (with Jessica Lange staring as Farmer).  Lange's performance is amazing as she looks remarkably like Frances Farmer and her acting is so convincing that I think watching the real Farmer could only top it.Frances may have always been on the rebellious side and this, along with a controlling and suppressive mother, got her into a lot of trouble.  Frances ends up being an actress in Hollywood but despises Hollywood.  Eventually, her attitude and acting out brings the wrath of those who control the film industry and lands her in a psych ward.  In the next few years she is in and out of several mental institutions.The movie tastefully shows us the ""treatments"" and abuses that were rampant in the bedlams of the day (a much more detailed account is in her autobiography).  These ""treatments"" include hydrotherapy (pouring cold water on the patient), insulin shock therapy and forced drugging.  One scene shows Farmer receiving a lobotomy, which critics' claim did not happen.  The abuses included being treated like an animal in filthy, overcrowded conditions and the orderlies acting as pimps and allowing others from the outside world to rape the patients (including Farmer).""Frances"" is an amazing film about a tragic Hollywood story.  Even if the movie is based on her life (and not a 100% accurate documentary), the events are remarkable.  Even if half of the events are accurate, they are not ones you would want anyone you like to experience.  I highly recommend this movie because the story is interesting and reveals the sinister side of involuntary commitment.

While many people today may have never heard of the once fairly popular and definitely controversial actress, her story is intensely powerful, and Jessica Lange does an outstanding job re-creating the woman of the film's title: Lange almost eerily resembles Farmer physically as well. Born in 1914, Farmer was a headstrong rebel since High School when her controversial composition - entitled GOD DIES - was published in a local paper. Farmer traveled to Communist Russia in the early thirties, and was later involved romantically with playwright Clifford Odets, whose successful play - GOLDEN BOY - gave her critical kudos: she was brilliant in her playing of the female lead, Lorna Moon. While not a perfect film by any means, it contains potent episodes which really happened to a once-promising, beautiful Hollywood actress who succumbed to alcoholism. Frances was an individualist and non-conformist who couldn't handle Hollywood's artifice: we are never totally sure whether alcohol was the chief reason Farmer went whacko - it seems her mental state was brilliant but highly neurotic. Farmer's first husband, the actor Leif Erikson once commented thusly: ""Frances was a dear soul but oh so tormented"". After Farmer was released from mental institutions, the victim of various torturous ""treatments"", it was as if her spirit had died. As depressing and frankly shocking though this film may be, it's an account of one woman's descent into hell. For those who are interested in catching a sample of Farmer's greatest work on film, rent or buy Samuel Goldwyn's 1936 classic COME AND GET IT which was based on the Edna Ferber novel: in the dual role of mother and daughter, Farmer is nothing less than sensational, her natural playing being quite unusual for the time.",5,AN AWESOME BIOGRAPHIC FILM.,1032998400,"09 26, 2002",2002,1978,"['tragically', 'ill-fated', 'morbidly', 'fascinating', 'life', 'Frances', 'Farmer', 'stage-trained', 'actress', 'who', 'hailed', 'Seattle', 'wowed', 'critics', 'handful', 'performances', 'movies', '1936-1942', 'many', 'people', 'today', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'once', 'fairly', 'popular', 'definitely', 'controversial', 'actress', 'story', 'intensely', 'powerful', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'outstanding', 'job', 're-creating', 'woman', 'film', 'title', 'Lange', 'almost', 'eerily', 'Farmer', 'physically', 'as', 'well', 'Born', '1914', 'Farmer', 'was', 'headstrong', 'rebel', 'High', 'School', 'when', 'controversial', 'composition', 'entitled', 'GOD', 'DIES', 'was', 'published', 'local', 'paper', 'Farmer', 'traveled', 'Communist', 'Russia', 'early', 'thirties', 'was', 'later', 'involved', 'romantically', 'playwright', 'Clifford', 'Odets', 'successful', 'play', 'GOLDEN', 'BOY', 'gave', 'critical', 'kudos', 'was', 'brilliant', 'playing', 'female', 'lead', 'Lorna', 'Moon', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'means', 'potent', 'episodes', 'really', 'happened', 'once-promising', 'beautiful', 'Hollywood', 'actress', 'who', 'succumbed', 'alcoholism', 'Frances', 'was', 'individualist', 'non-conformist', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'Hollywood', 'artifice', 'are', 'never', 'totally', 'sure', 'alcohol', 'was', 'chief', 'reason', 'Farmer', 'went', 'whacko', 'mental', 'state', 'was', 'brilliant', 'highly', 'neurotic', 'Farmer', 'first', 'husband', 'actor', 'Leif', 'Erikson', 'once', 'commented', 'thusly', 'Frances', 'was', 'dear', 'soul', 'oh', 'so', 'tormented', 'Farmer', 'was', 'released', 'mental', 'institutions', 'victim', 'various', 'torturous', 'treatments', 'was', 'spirit', 'had', 'died', 'depressing', 'frankly', 'shocking', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'account', 'one', 'woman', 'descent', 'hell', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'catching', 'sample', 'Farmer', 'greatest', 'work', 'film', 'rent', 'buy', 'Samuel', 'Goldwyn', '1936', 'classic', 'COME', 'AND', 'GET', 'IT', 'was', 'based', 'Edna', 'Ferber', 'novel', 'dual', 'role', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Farmer', 'nothing', 'less', 'sensational', 'natural', 'playing', 'being', 'quite', 'unusual', 'time']",N/A

She probably should have stuck to the stage. In any case, this film is very well-made and all of the actors are excellent.

When we first meet Frances as a high-school student, her strong independent character is already formed after she wins first place in an essay contest with ""God Dies"", an incendiary piece of writing for anyone in 1931, let alone a young girl. The resulting public outcry and controlling manipulative reaction of her mother are a harbinger of what will come. From this early scene the outcome is inevitable, and we become voyeurs of her climactic rise to stardom with the film ""Come and Get it"" to her dramatic slide into a hellish world of drugs, arrests and brutal, primitive mental institutions. Unfortunately, the script goes out of its way to contrast the independent minded, strong willed actress with contemporaries that are no more than flaccid caricatures. The history of the time is likewise simplified in stereotypical fashion. While this perspective does isolate Frances all the more, the effect is neutralized by the addition of a fictionalized long time friend named Harry. It's great that he is always there with words of encouragement and a shoulder to cry on, but the real Frances never had a Harry. Despite the obstacles presented by a superficial script, Francis is a  painful, difficult film to watch and one that stays with you a long time.",3,"Superficial script, but what a performance from Lange!!",1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,1398,"['specious', 'account', 'troubled', 'life', 'actress', 'Frances', 'Elena', 'Farmer', 'saved', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'performance', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Frances', 'high-school', 'student', 'strong', 'independent', 'character', 'already', 'formed', 'first', 'place', 'essay', 'contest', 'God', 'Dies', 'incendiary', 'piece', 'writing', 'anyone', '1931', 'let', 'alone', 'young', 'girl', 'resulting', 'public', 'outcry', 'controlling', 'manipulative', 'reaction', 'mother', 'are', 'harbinger', 'what', 'will', 'come', 'early', 'scene', 'outcome', 'inevitable', 'become', 'voyeurs', 'climactic', 'rise', 'stardom', 'film', 'Come', 'Get', 'dramatic', 'slide', 'hellish', 'world', 'drugs', 'arrests', 'brutal', 'primitive', 'mental', 'institutions', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'way', 'contrast', 'independent', 'minded', 'strong', 'willed', 'actress', 'contemporaries', 'are', 'more', 'flaccid', 'caricatures', 'history', 'time', 'likewise', 'simplified', 'stereotypical', 'fashion', 'perspective', 'isolate', 'Frances', 'more', 'effect', 'neutralized', 'addition', 'fictionalized', 'long', 'time', 'friend', 'named', 'Harry', 'great', 'always', 'words', 'encouragement', 'shoulder', 'cry', 'real', 'Frances', 'never', 'had', 'Harry', 'obstacles', 'presented', 'superficial', 'script', 'Francis', 'painful', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'one', 'long', 'time']",N/A

355766,A2B8EVP48GVZ4R,6303094910,Veronica Anzaldua,"[2, 3]","Frances Farmer was a 1930s actress who starred in movies such as ""Come and Get It"".  But she was known more for what happened in her real life than her movies.  A native of Seattle, Frances was a non-comformist.  She was outspoken, independent, politically active, and unlike the many celebrities of her time--and even ours--pursued acting for the sake of acting.  She didn't pursue it for the money, the fame, or the recognition.  She did it because she loved it; it was what she wanted to do.  And she wanted to be free to choose her own roles.  She was very much her own person, the Susan Sarandon and Jane Fonda of her time.However, she was doing all of this in the 30s, a time when being a rebel in Hollywood was frowned upon.  In fact, it was downright discouraged.  The studio executives didn't take too kindly to this, and they made sure Frances paid for it.  Oh, boy, did she ever pay.  Hollywood may not have directly contributed to her downfall, but they surely played their part.  Coupled with the troubles in her own life (such as her drinking and brushes with the law), not to mention a very troubled relationship with her mom (a controlling, exploitative woman who seemed to live vicariously through her daughter without caring what she was doing to her), Frances spent the better part of her adult life in various mental institutions where patients were mistreated and sexually exploited (men would be snuck in after hours to have sex with them).  She was eventually given a transorbital lobotomy, robbing her of all the traits that made her who she once was.  Some have said that she never really got one and others have said that she did.  We'll never know.Frances Farmer wasn't really crazy.  Sure, she was no angel, but she absolutely wasn't crazy.  She was a strong, independent woman who just wanted to be true to herself.  After all was said and done, she was killed, not physically, but emotionally and mentally.",5,Offscreen Drama,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,1936,"['Frances', 'Farmer', 'was', '1930s', 'actress', 'who', 'starred', 'movies', 'such', 'Come', 'Get', 'was', 'known', 'more', 'what', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'movies', 'native', 'Seattle', 'Frances', 'was', 'non-comformist', 'was', 'outspoken', 'independent', 'politically', 'active', 'many', 'celebrities', 'time', 'even', 'ours', 'pursued', 'acting', 'sake', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'pursue', 'money', 'fame', 'recognition', 'did', 'loved', 'was', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'wanted', 'be', 'free', 'choose', 'own', 'roles', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'own', 'person', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'time.However', 'was', 'doing', '30s', 'time', 'when', 'being', 'rebel', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'frowned', 'fact', 'was', 'downright', 'discouraged', 'studio', 'executives', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'kindly', 'made', 'sure', 'Frances', 'paid', 'Oh', 'boy', 'did', 'ever', 'pay', 'Hollywood', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'directly', 'contributed', 'downfall', 'surely', 'played', 'part', 'Coupled', 'troubles', 'own', 'life', 'such', 'drinking', 'brushes', 'law', 'not', 'mention', 'very', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'mom', 'controlling', 'exploitative', 'woman', 'who', 'seemed', 'live', 'vicariously', 'daughter', 'caring', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'Frances', 'spent', 'better', 'part', 'adult', 'life', 'various', 'mental', 'institutions', 'where', 'patients', 'were', 'mistreated', 'sexually', 'exploited', 'men', 'would', 'be', 'snuck', 'hours', 'have', 'sex', 'was', 'eventually', 'given', 'transorbital', 'lobotomy', 'robbing', 'traits', 'made', 'who', 'once', 'was', 'have', 'said', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'one', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'did', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know.Frances', 'Farmer', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'crazy', 'Sure', 'was', 'angel', 'absolutely', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'was', 'strong', 'independent', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'true', 'herself', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'was', 'killed', 'not', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'mentally']",N/A
