1084218,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000RXVND8,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","A Blueprint for Murder, 1953 filmThis is an interesting drama about family relations and inheritance as a motive for murder. Who poisoned a patient in a hospital? Was it some kind of mistake or murder for money? One woman has the motive and opportunity, but there isn't enough evidence for even an indictment. This woman will take the son on a trip to Europe. Does she plan some evil for this child so she can inherit great wealth? A cremation in Europe would destroy any evidence of poison. [No mention of the fact that European countries have had a Medical Examiner system since the early 19th century to handle suspicious deaths.] Cameron inspects this relative's possessions for any poison. Her aspirin bottles reveal three tablets with a ""W"", just like rat poison (""Warfarin"").Can he make a test to see if this is poison or just another brand of aspirin. [For decades tablets have some sort of identification to prevent such errors.] Cameron takes one tablet and will try a dangerous test on Lynn! He called the ship's detective as a witness for their conversation. Lynn denies everything, it seems that Cameron may be guilty of more than bad manners! [He also has a motive of inheritance, being another relative. You wonder just who is the guilty party.] This drama shows the working of a police investigation to determine if a crime has been committed. What if there isn't enough proof for an indictment? Does wealth guarantee happiness? Can there be danger from greedy relatives? Some can be in danger from an enemy who merely wants to create a temporary sickness for whatever motive. [Putting some harmless food can create a problem for anyone who has food allergies, like with peanuts.]This story's ending seems weak, as if it was tacked on. It shows that there may be more than one person with a motive for inheritance by murder. Usually, a woman will murder by poison, a man will murder by violence.

1084220,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000RXVND8,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 4]","Personally, I like my femme fatales, my cinematic femme fatales anyway, pretty straightforward. Someone like fetching sultry Jane Greer in Out Of The Past who when she got cross with her main squeeze, her main connected man, shot him point blank and took a bunch of his cash as she sauntered out the door to sunny Mexico. Nice. And then when he, Kirk Douglas he, had her tailed by a couple of private gumshoes to get the dough back, and maybe her too you know how connected guys are, she thought nothing of shooting one of them dead, very dead when the heat was on, and led the other one a merry chase (although he, Robert Mitchum he, knew the score, and took the ride anyway), and when Robert got ""religion"" on her put the rooty-toot-toot on him too. At least a guy knew where he stood with dear Jane and if he was silly enough to turn his back on her under any circumstances then shame on him. So if his neck was tired from turning around, or if he forgot, and he neglected his defense and a cold piece of steel came his way he was forewarned. Yah, I can appreciate dear Jane because in this wicked old world when a girl is from hunger, well, a girl has got to do what she has to do.This femme in the film under review, Blueprint For Murder, though throws me off, is somebody who I can't figure. Yah, this Lynne Cameron (played by Jean Peters) is something else, smart, beautiful (although not to these eyes drop- dead beautiful and sultry like Ms. Greer), would be good company on a cold night, seemingly on top of the world yet was a stone-cold killer, a murderess, a child murderess. And the child in question was one of her stepchildren. See she married rich Bill Cameron after his wife died. (It came out later, at least it was rumored and so take it for what it is worth, that she, working under the name Lola Landry, was a high- class call girl when she met Bill, he was bowled over, and married her after a few weeks. Another story making the rounds later, and one that is more believable to these ears, was that she was a torch singer, working under the name, LaVerne LaRue (nice),in one of Chi town gangster Johnny Rico's night spots, and his girlfriend. Once he was sent up to Joliet and the dough stopped she, having to watch out for herself in this wicked old world , grabbed for the next best thing, one sad sack but rich widower Bill Cameron whom she met at the club one night and his two young kids, Polly and Doug)Things were okay, okay as long as Bill breathed and was shelling out the dough to keep her in comfort and was happy with her care of his kids but then he up and died of some rare and exotic disease (no she didn't have anything to do with his demise after all he was the meal ticket, as far as the coppers were able to determine). Under the terms of Bill's will though our Lynne was to get coffee and cakes from his million dollar plus estate (yes, it sounds like chump change, just walking around money now, but was real dough, real felony-worthy dough in the 1950s) unless the kids died before her. Some foolish lawyer arrangement as it turned out to protect the kids and kind of freeze her out. Something must have snapped in her with this news because she started spending all her waking hours studying toxicology, studying about human reactions to various types of poisons and, more importantly, how traceable, how criminally traceable they were.Lynne did her work well as Polly was the first to go from a strychnine dose, not once, but twice, the second time in the hospital after she ""volunteered,"" as an angel of mercy to run out and get an antidote prescription filled. Yes, Lynne was nothing but a stone-cold killer when she got her wanting habits on. Enter Uncle Cam (played by Joseph Cotten), Bill's brother, who couldn't understand how Polly, who appeared to be recovering, could go under. And he was aided (egged on too) in his suspicions by Bill's lawyer and his over-read amateur sleuth wife who built the case for Polly poisoning inch by inch. More importantly, pointing the finger directly at Lynne once the terms of the will entered center stage as a motive, and once little innocent Doug found himself as the only thing between Lynne and a big payday.The beauty of poisoning, as the baffled authorities discovered from the amateur sleuths to the cops to the D.A. to judge, is that unless you see the person actually administer the damn stuff it is hard to get a conviction. Cam and his associates tried, got Lynne charged, and got laughed out of court. And in the aftermath laughed at in the face by Lynne who planned to take Doug away from prying eyes with a long European trip by boat. Good-bye Doug. Well, not quite. Cam decided he needed to get some fresh air so he took that same boat trip, pretend courted Lynne, and administered a dose of strychnine that he found in her vanity into her drink. (All parties admitted later that he was both heroic and foolish in that rash act.)Then they played chicken, as the poison worked its way through her system and time was running out. She stood up for her ""innocence"" like a real pro but in the end she had to cry ""uncle"" and wound up in some women's prison doing life for her efforts. Yah, give me a Jane femme and a cranked neck every time, so I don't have to hire somebody to test my food and drink like the kings of old did.

1084223,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000RXVND8,Byron Kolln,"[26, 27]","Two obscure films from the Twentieth Century-Fox vaults make up the double feature on this outstanding Midnite Movies release.  Apart from the fact that both movies were produced in 1953, they aren't linked by a common theme or star, nevertheless these two movies are definitely worth the time for classic film buffs.First on the bill is A BLUEPRINT FOR MURDER (written and directed by Andrew L. Stone).  When his little niece dies following an unexplained illness, Whitney Cameron (Joseph Cotten) begins to suspect the child's stepmother Lynne (Jean Peters).  The ice-cool society type, Lynne hardly seems a candidate for murder, but when it's revealed she'll inherit the entire family fortune should she outlive her stepchildren, Cam starts to fear for the safety of nephew Doug (Freddy Ridgeway).  With the help of his sleuthing friends (Gary Merrill and Catherine McLeod), Cam sets out to trap Lynne using her very own ""blueprint"" for murder...This stylish murder noir is a perfect showcase for Fox contract player Jean Peters (""Niagara"", ""Three Coins in the Fountain"").  She brings a sense of ambiguous danger to the role of Lynne.  Joseph Cotten is very strong too.  Normally the villain in these types of movies, it's a rare change seeing him as the hero.  Catherine McLeod and Gary Merrill (""All About Eve"") have fun roles as the amateur sleuths.Next up is MAN IN THE ATTIC (directed by Hugo Fregonese, based on a novel by Marie Belloc Lowndes).  In gas-lit London at the turn of the century, the district of Whitechapel is being terrorised by a series of grisly murders involving prostitutes and actresses.  Slade (Jack Palance) seems to fit the description of the murderer and lives a mysterious life as lodger in the house belonging to Mr and Mrs Harley (Rhys Williams and Frances Bavier).  When the Harleys' showgirl niece Lily Bonner (Constance Smith) comes to stay, Slade's behaviour grows more erratic...and the body-count in Whitechapel rises steadily.Produced by Panoramic Productions, MAN IN THE ATTIC was a virtual scene-for-scene remake of an earlier Fox movie, ""The Lodger"" (made in 1944, starring Laird Cregar and Merle Oberon).  Jack Palance is perfectly cast as the moody, mysterious stranger who may or may not be Jack The Ripper.  The Whitechapel murder mystery (and the identity of the person/s who committed them) has never been completely solved.  MAN IN THE ATTIC tries to answer the mystery.Each movie is presented on it's very own disc.  Bonus features consist of original trailers plus animated photo galleries (containing rare on-set candids and beautiful production stills).

1084224,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000RXVND8,C. O. DeRiemer,"[41, 43]","A Blueprint for Murder:""Lynne's warmth and affection for Doug helped so much to soften the blow of his sister's death. Never did Maggie's absurd suspicions seem more fantastic than now."" That's Cam Cameron speaking to us. Doug is his nephew, a little boy whose sister, Polly, has just died in hospital of what turns out to have been strychnine poisoning. Their step-mother, the cool, beautiful Lynne Cameron (Jean Peters), is, of course, distressed, just as she was when her husband, the children's father, died mysteriously with the same symptoms. Lynne's brother-in-law, Whitney Cameron (Joseph Cotton), Cam for short, who flew into town when Polly became ill, can see for himself how solicitous Lynne is toward young Doug. He's not about to listen to the suspicions raised by his good friends, Maggie and Fred Sergeant (Catherine McLeod and Gary Merrill).But wait a minute. Fred, a lawyer, now remembers the terms of the will he drew up for Polly's and Doug's father. A great deal of money was placed into a trust, the interest of which is going to Lynne. Ah, but if the children die, Lynne will get the principal as well as the interest. A little worm of doubt now starts to nibble away in Cam's brain, which is particularly unsettling because Cam is beginning to have certain feelings for Lynne. All we know for sure is that Lynne is the kind of cool. competent woman who would most likely warm up only if she had a whip in her hand and you at her feet. It all comes together on board a transatlantic liner taking Lynne, Doug and Cam to Europe. It involves a clever ruse that calls for a pill that might or might not be aspirin, a cocktail that tastes a little bitter and a whole lot of scenery chewing.Unfortunately, the final revelation is so abrupt and commonplace and the movie then ends so quickly and complacently that we can only give a shrug. Still, up to then it's passably pleasurable.Man In the Attic:""Jack the Ripper...what a revolting, stupid name!"" says Mr. Slade. He has every reason to be offended. Note that while elements of the plot are discussed, almost everything is laid out for the viewer in the film's first 15 minutes. It's 1888 and Jack has been at work off and on for several weeks. His victims are all women who have been entertainers at one time or another. Jack's knives leave messy leftovers.Late one night with the London fog swirling around the gaslit streets, Mr. and Mrs. Harley (Rhys Williams and Frances Bavier) hear a knock on their door. It's a Mr. Slade (Jack Palance) who is answering their notice of a room to let. He not only takes the room but also their small, third floor attic. He needs it, he tells Mrs. Harley, so that he can conduct his experiments. Mr. Slade is a pathologist. He seems nice enough, the Harley's dog takes to him at once and he pays a month in advance. When he learns that the Harley's niece, Lily Bonner (Constance Smith), will be staying in the house, and that she is a showgirl on the stage, he is obviously distracted. Her act, Lily Bonner and Her Girls, is getting a lot of notice. We even get to see her do two full numbers. Prince Edward is seen clapping approvingly. But the swirling fog keeps blanketing the city, more women are found brutally cut to death, and Mr. Slade keeps returning home at very late hours. The police put every resource they can into the hunt. Queen Victoria makes it clear that no married man could be capable of such crimes and recommends that all bachelors be rounded up. The police investigation is led by Inspector Paul Warwick (Byron Palmer), a smart copper who is attracted to Lily as soon as he meets her. And it seems that Slade is attracted to Lily, too. He confesses to Lily that his unease and loneliness is due to his mother, a woman ""incapable of love, only lust,"" who left home when he was a child. His father took ten years to drink himself to death with absinthe. ""Did you ever see your mother again?"" Lily asks Slade. Yes, he says. She'd become a street walker. I saw her once. We also have a sense of Slade's unbalanced torment. Often his late evenings are spent simply in lonely and unhealthy contemplation. ""Sometimes I walk close by the river,"" he tells Lily. ""The river is like liquid night flowing peacefully out to infinity."" We know what's coming; there are no surprises. After a rousing night-time chase through London's damp streets, the last thing we see is the swirling waters of the Thames.Oh, what a grade B hamfest this movie is. I mean that in a kind way because the movie is fun to watch. There are so many things wrong with it that the movie has a kind of endearing, well-intentioned amateurishness about it.Jack Palance, young and tormented, with his small sunken eyes, prominent cheek bones, strong chin and heavy brow, does a credible job. So do Frances Bavier and Rhys Williams. But the rest of the cast can barely act. Some of the dialogue is so ripe it's juicy. ""You're the same as my mother,"" Slade shouts, ""the same as all of them...mocking love and living for lust! Your beauty must be cut away!""Man In the Attic has a kind of Poverty Row charm. The film is trying hard to be a Jack the Ripper psycho-thriller. The producers just couldn't round up the talent or the budget to come close, but they tried.-----The DVD picture for both transfers looks fine. There are no extras of any significance.",4,"For those who love older films, these two might do with their almost endearing flaws",1190764800,"09 26, 2007",2007,5344,"['Blueprint', 'Murder', 'Lynne',

1084225,A16VH7SPVPVJKV,B000RXVND8,Harvey M. Canter,"[100, 108]","While I cannot speak to the Jack Palance film, I can say that I am very enthusiastic indeed that Blueprint for Murder is FINALLY coming out in public release. This one never made it to VHS, even, and could only be gotten via bootleg copies on ebay--and happily so! This is a taut little low-budget thriller, with Jean Peters as the step-mom with ice-water in her veins and dollar signs in her eyes; and Joseph Cotten is her earnest, bumbling brother-in-law whose hormones cloud his judgment as to her dark, dark intentions--at least for a little while! Peters is just sensational, embodying a fetching femme fatale who is both seeringly voluptuous and deeply dangerous. She really steals the show here. Cotten is effective in his ineffectiveness, but he proves right in the end. While not of the caliber of Double Indemnity or Out of the Past, owing to a rather flat, stodgy pictorial style and mise en scene, the film is really story/character/actor driven, and is very engrossing. There are a lot of movies coming out under the rubric of Film Noir that are not even close to Film Noir (e.g., Daisy Kenyon) but when you call something FN it sells, I guess. Blueprint for Murder is the real deal, though. It is great to see some truly obscure ones making it to DVD. Now, how about the original version of Caught with Robert Ryan?

1084236,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B000RXVND8,Silver Screen Videos,"[0, 0]","Two relatively obscure but generally entertaining nourish suspense films are available in one package in another Midnite Movies double feature.Blueprint for Murder features Jean Peters as a femme fatale whose husband and stepdaughter die under mysterious circumstances. The dead man's brother, Joseph Cotton, is gradually persuaded by the family attorney that Peters poisoned both of them, and if she can kill the only remaining child, she will inherit a fortune. Cotten begins romancing Peters and accompanies her on a cruise to find out the truth and, if necessary, expose her. Although the film keeps up the pretense of a guessing game for a while as to whether Peters is guilty, there's little doubt, and she turns out to be a deliciously nasty piece of work. The question then becomes whether Cotten can expose her or not. The ending is a bit weak, but excusable considering the taut running time and pace of the movie.Man in the Attic is another version of the classic novel, The Lodger, originally filmed by Alfred Hitchcock. A quiet but troubled young man played by Jack Palance rents an attic apartment from Andy Griffith's Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier) and her family. However, his new landlords soon suspect Palance is actually Jack the Ripper, who is currently terrorizing London.  As with Blueprint for Murder, there's little real mystery here; the only question is whether Palance will do in the family's daughter, a showgirl at a local review who develops feelings for him (the film does sanitize the profession of the murder victims somewhat). Palance is surprisingly restrained here, definitely creepy but apparently more troubled than outright menacing so that the family can be excused for failing to figure things out much earlier in the film. Also, as with Blueprint, the ending is somewhat routine.Separately, I would rate these movies three stars each, but the bonus of finding two such rareties in one low-priced package is worth an extra star.",4,Two Entertaining Noirish Thrillers at One Low Price,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,1964,"['Two', 'relatively', 'obscure', 'generally', 'entertaining', 'nourish', 'suspense', 'films', 'are', 'available', 'one', 'package', 'Midnite', 'Movies', 'double', 'feature.Blueprint', 'Murder', 'features', 'Jean', 'Peters', 'femme', 'fatale', 'husband', 'stepdaughter', 'die', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'dead', 'man', 'brother', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'gradually', 'persuaded', 'family', 'attorney', 'Peters', 'poisoned', 'can', 'kill', 'only', 'remaining', 'child', 'will', 'inherit', 'fortune', 'Cotten', 'romancing', 'Peters', 'cruise', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'necessary', 'expose', 'film', 'up', 'pretense', 'guessing', 'game', 'while', 'Peters', 'guilty', 'little', 'doubt', 'out', 'be', 'deliciously', 'nasty', 'piece', 'work', 'question', 'then', 'Cotten', 'can', 'expose', 'not', 'ending', 'bit', 'weak', 'excusable', 'considering', 'taut', 'running', 'time', 'pace', 'movie.Man', 'Attic', 'version', 'classic', 'novel', 'Lodger', 'originally', 'filmed', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'A', 'quiet', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'played', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'attic', 'apartment', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Aunt', 'Bee', 'Frances', 'Bavier', 'family', 'However', 'new', 'landlords', 'soon', 'suspect', 'Palance', 'actually', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'who', 'currently', 'terrorizing', 'London', 'Blueprint', 'Murder', 'little', 'real', 'mystery', 'here', 'only', 'question', 'Palance', 'will', 'do', 'family', 'daughter', 'showgirl', 'local', 'review', 'who', 'feelings', 'film', 'sanitize', 'profession', 'murder', 'victims', 'somewhat', 'Palance', 'surprisingly', 'restrained', 'here', 'definitely', 'creepy', 'apparently', 'more', 'troubled', 'outright', 'menacing', 'so', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'excused', 'failing', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'much', 'earlier', 'film', 'Also', 'Blueprint', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'routine.Separately', 'would', 'rate', 'movies', 'three', 'stars', 'bonus', 'finding', 'two', 'such', 'rareties', 'one', 'low-priced', 'package', 'extra', 'star']",A Blueprint for Murder / Man in the Attic
