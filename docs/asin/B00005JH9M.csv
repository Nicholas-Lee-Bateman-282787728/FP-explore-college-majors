Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi, as always, are excellent, and Greg Kinnear and Keanu are good too. My only problem with the cast is Hilary Swank as a battered, ignorant, poor-white person. It just does not wash in this case, even though a similar character was so believable in Boys Don't Cry. Hilary's performance is a mild annoyance throughout this movie which is excellent overall.

First of all, what a great all-star cast, Keanu Reeves, Katie Holmes, Hilary Swank, Giovanni Ribsi, and Greg Kinnear.  Blanchett plays Annie, a fortune teller. She has two boys and she is a widow, her ""gift"" is put to the ultimate test after a wealthy but sexually promiscuous woman (Holmes) is brutually murdered but who was she murdered by? Annie must uncover the awful truth and she makes some enemies along the way especially the locals who think she's a witch.

She is so wicked and it's great. Katie does have her only nude scene (in Hollywood so far) in this movie and she is very beautiful. Everyone in this did a fabulous job in acting, and it kept you on your toes and did frighten you a bit, I just wasn't really fond of any of the other actors in this movie, their characters I mean. It was kind of an ugly, depressing movie sadly instead of a dramatic thriller than kept you fascinated.Cate Blanchett, the star of the movie who played Annabelle 'Annie' Wilson did a fabulous job.  She plays the town's fortune teller/psychic whose husband has died and she's raising her two sons on her own.  When Katie Holmes's character Jessica King is murdered, she finds where Jessica's body disappeared to through her psyhic abilities, and works hard to solve the mystery of who did it while struggling through the troubles of her own life.Keanu Reeves's character Donnie Barksdale is also brilliantly performed.  I didn't even realize it was him!  He plays an abusive husband who beats the hell out of his wife and smacks Katie Holmes around a bit as long as anyone else who gets in his way.  But what terrible things is he guilty of and what is he actually innocent of?Greg Kinnear's character Wayne Collins is a different type of character than I've ever seen Greg play and he did fabulously.  He is Katie Holmes's fiancee and is devestated by her murder, but he knows a little more than he's letting on, and Cate Blanchett works with him to discover who is the REAL murderer of Jessica King (Katie Holmes).Everyone in this movie did very well and it does keep you frightened and waiting for the next bomb shell to drop, with a surprising twist at the end!

With some movies, it's the destination you enjoy, with others, it's the journey. The Gift is definitely a 'journey' movie. The plot is fairly predictable at points - for instance, the person on trial kind of needs to be genuinely innocent, despite glaring neon signs to the contrary, because the movie is only half over.Still, the acting is superb and Cate Blanchett in particular shines as a paragon of versatility as she perfectly portrays a strong-yet-vulnerable single mother whilst expertly avoiding the obvious ""mother earth goddess"" stereotype by allowing her character to be imperfect, unsure, and at time flat-out wrong. And the ""twist"" at the end, when we find whodunit is shielded about as carefully as it can be, with believable red herrings intervening and genuine doubt regarding the veracity of Cate's ""gift"".My favorite aspect of the movie, though, is purely the ironic twist in the title - while psychic abilities might seem to some to be an enviable 'gift', Cate superbly shows that a ""gift"" can be a worthless one, and sometimes even a curse. Cate's ""gift"" does not save her husband, nor does it put food on the table in reliable quantities, nor does it earn her the respect of a community, nor does it prevent her from witnessing horrible atrocities.

A great cast with a lousy storyActually, 'The Gift' does provide viewers with a great cast, but to be fair, the story is not lousy.  It is formula, it is predictable, but it's not lousy.Cate Blanchett plays Annie Wilson, a Georgia widow with three young boys.  Annie scrapes together a living by giving psychic readings.  She's not a con artist.  She genuinely cares about people:  the friend (played by Hillary Swank) being abused by her redneck husband (Keanu Reeves), the local town idiot, and others.  She does have a gift, which she uses to try to find the killer of a prominent local woman.The cast of 'The Gift' kept me watching through a very predictable script.  Without giving away the plot, I can tell you that there are really no true surprises since everything in the film is telegraphed.  The story of the ""psychic"" or ""seer"" has been used in many films countless times.  The only thing that separates 'The Gift' from all the other films in this genre is its all-star cast.

That's not to say the acting skills are below average or anything- the acting *is* actually really good.  Maybe it's the storyline giving off somewhat of a low budget feel, despite being interesting enough to watch the entire way through.Or actually, it's probably the feeling that the film writers were holding back a bit and unwilling to accurately portray how violent a few of the segments REALLY could be, making the movie almost appropriate for regular TV (despite a few nasty words being thrown around occasionally, of course).It's about a psychic woman living in a small town with her three kids, and she predicts events that eventually happen which means -because she lives in a small town perhaps- everyone accuses her of being a witch.Throughout the movie there's certain troublemakers she has to deal with, such as one of her patients violent and abusive husbands, who dominates the first half of the movie by constantly threatening the psychic woman and accusing her of being a witch.  The second half of the movie involves a court case and the town police over who murdered this one woman and threw her body in a lake.The courtroom scene dragged about five minutes too long, but other than that, this movie had a bunch of highlights.  It's mostly a film for adults, thanks to a few really violent scenes, and of course, the occasional strong cussing doesn't help matters either.

583567,A1OUEDUZ4AHVIZ,B00005JH9M,"Ben Stubbs ""Horror / Metal Enthusiast""","[1, 1]","""The Gift"" was a pleasant surprise for me. On reading the plot, my hopes for the movie were not particularly high. The main reason for this was due to the whole story revolving around the main character's abilities as a fortune teller. I've always seen this as a rather bad storytelling device, mainly due to so many recent movies utilizing ""visions"" and ""clairvoyance"" to allow characters to know things that the writers can see no other way of expressing to the audience. Check out ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" for a perfect example. The creators were struggling to let the audience know the history of the creature involved, so instead of figuring out an ingenious way to do so, one of the cheerleaders suddenly starts to have flashbacks and visions for no obvious reason. Anyway, seeing that Sam Raimi, the director of the cult ""Evil Dead"" series and more recently the ""Spider Man"" movies was at the helm for ""The Gift"", I thought I'd give it a shot despite my concerns.When a young woman (played by a very sultry Katie Holmes) disappears, the police are baffled as to what has happened to her. In desperation, they grudgingly seek advice from the town clairvoyant Annie (wonderfully portrayed by the extremely talented Cate Blanchett).  With the help of her psychic powers, Annie leads the police to the property of Donnie Barkwell (Keanu Reeves in a surprisingly cast role). But is Donnie a killer? And can Annie's evidence against him hold up considering its psychic origin?There are a few things that make this movie work. Firstly, the acting is mostly superb. Cate Blanchett is just staggering as Annie. I mentioned earlier how difficult it is to use psychic phenomena as a plot builder, and it takes a seriously talented actor to be able to pull it off. Cate's performance is completely believable, which is just as well, as the whole movie depends on it. Besides Blanchett, Greg Kinnear, Giovanni Ribisi, Hilary Swank and Katie Holmes all put in good performances. But Keanu Reeves is the surprise packet for me. I know he can act when given a role that allows him to do so. ""The Devil's Advocate"" showcased his abilities to some extent. But I never would have thought he could ever play a villain role, or in this case, a dangerous tough-guy redneck. While he's nowhere near as impressive as the movie's star, he puts in a dominant performance with the help of good direction.Speaking of direction, Sam Raimi does an awesome job crafting a tight thriller with supernatural and horror elements. His dabbling experience in different genres is really paying off now with an ability to pull A list actors and still make movies designed to creep you out and scratch your head in equal doses. ""The Gift"" is a really enjoyable horror themed thriller that will keep you glued to your seat. If it wasn't for the highly dubious climax (which I won't give away here except to say that it pushes the boundaries of what the audience should be willing to except) and the occasional clich&eacute; characters (the police are always idiots in these films), I'd give this full marks.",4,Good horror / thriller with some great performances.,1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,3069,"['Gift', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'reading', 'plot', 'hopes', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'particularly', 'high', 'main', 'reason', 'was', 'due', 'whole', 'story', 'revolving', 'main', 'character', 'abilities', 'fortune', 'teller', ""'ve"", 'always', 'seen', 'rather', 'bad', 'storytelling', 'device', 'mainly', 'due', 'so', 'many', 'recent', 'movies', 'utilizing', 'visions', 'clairvoyance', 'allow', 'characters', 'know', 'things', 'writers', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'way', 'expressing', 'audience', 'Check', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'perfect', 'example', 'creators', 'were', 'struggling', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'history', 'creature', 'involved', 'instead', 'figuring', 'out', 'ingenious', 'way', 'do', 'so', 'one', 'cheerleaders', 'suddenly', 'have', 'flashbacks', 'visions', 'obvious', 'reason', 'Anyway', 'seeing', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'director', 'cult', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'series', 'more', 'recently', 'Spider', 'Man', 'movies', 'was', 'helm', 'Gift', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'shot', 'concerns.When', 'young', 'woman', 'played', 'very', 'sultry', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'police', 'are', 'baffled', 'what', 'happened', 'desperation', 'grudgingly', 'seek', 'advice', 'town', 'clairvoyant', 'Annie', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'extremely', 'talented', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'help', 'psychic', 'powers', 'Annie', 'police', 'property', 'Donnie', 'Barkwell', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'surprisingly', 'cast', 'role', 'Donnie', 'killer', 'can', 'Annie', 'evidence', 'hold', 'up', 'considering', 'psychic', 'origin', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'make', 'movie', 'work', 'Firstly', 'acting', 'mostly', 'superb', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'just', 'staggering', 'Annie', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'how', 'difficult', 'use', 'psychic', 'phenomena', 'plot', 'builder', 'seriously', 'talented', 'actor', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'Cate', 'performance', 'completely', 'believable', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'whole', 'movie', 'Besides', 'Blanchett', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'put', 'good', 'performances', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'surprise', 'packet', 'know', 'can', 'act', 'when', 'given', 'role', 'do', 'so', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'showcased', 'abilities', 'extent', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'could', 'ever', 'play', 'villain', 'role', 'case', 'dangerous', 'tough-guy', 'redneck', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'impressive', 'movie', 'star', 'dominant', 'performance', 'help', 'good', 'direction.Speaking', 'direction', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'awesome', 'job', 'crafting', 'tight', 'thriller', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'elements', 'dabbling', 'experience', 'different', 'genres', 'really', 'paying', 'off', 'now', 'ability', 'pull', 'A', 'list', 'actors', 'still', 'make', 'movies', 'designed', 'creep', 'out', 'scratch', 'head', 'equal', 'doses', 'Gift', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'horror', 'themed', 'thriller', 'will', 'keep', 'glued', 'seat', 'was', ""n't"", 'highly', 'dubious', 'climax', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'here', 'say', 'boundaries', 'what', 'audience', 'should', 'be', 'willing', 'except', 'occasional', 'clich', 'eacute', 'characters', 'police', 'are', 'always', 'idiots', 'films', ""'d"", 'give', 'full', 'marks']",N/A

His threats of violence against both she and her kids are chilling.Giovanni Ribisi is profoundly disturbing as a mentally unbalanced man who may have been sexually abused, as a small child, by his father.When the psychic points to the red-neck's pond as the location of the murder victim's body, it is found there, and he is convicted of the murder, somehow you know that it is not going to be quite that simple ... as her continuing visions of the murdered girl seem to indicate.

583571,AKBKTA49ZTT2T,B00005JH9M,Bruce,"[1, 2]","The plot of &quot;The Gift&quot; is a curiously compelling mixture of human pathos and paranormality, albeit admittedly somewhat predictable. What makes this film interesting and noteworthy is: the beautiful southern backdrop, abrim with spanish moss and full moons and photogenic bayous; the quietly matter-of-fact handling of one woman's extrasensory abilities; a sterling cast rising to the occasion by instilling a level of truth and integrity to their performances. Cate Blanchett, at the helm of this remarkable ensemble, is soft-spoken and restrained as Annie, whose `gift' suddenly immerses her into the vortex of a dark and dangerous place, which she confronts with rectitude, compassion, and courage (arguably foolishly or not). Keanu Reeves is appropriately menacing and despicable as the villain of the piece (I'd be surprised if he didn't base his character on DeNiro in `Cape Fear'), unleashing his rage most frequently on his hapless wife, portrayed by Hillary Swank with wide-eyed, bayou-backward conviction. Greg Kinnear, quickly becoming one of my favorite actors of this era, professionally fleshes out a somewhat thankless role with warmth and sad-eyed sincerity. That the victim of the story (lustily played by Katie Holmes) is a debutante-harlot seems somewhat misogynistic (the implication being that she got what she deserved), and it is my only real qualm with the movie. Most astonishing, however, is Giovanni Ribisi's amazing portrayal of the psychologically disturbed Buddy, who seeks advice and redemption from Annie, and whose torment and anguish in the face of his inner demons is palpable. It is a richly textured and heartbreaking performance, and should have certainly earned Ribisi an Oscar nomination. Mostly because of the script, `The Gift' is not a great film, but earns high marks for sharp direction, superb acting, and lovely cinematography. And, oh yes . . . there are genuinely creepy moments that will chill and startle and leave your heart racing. But, significantly, those moments are not gratuitous, and are for the most part necessary to the story line.

Had writer Billy Bob Thornton skipped putting a murder at all in this film, it probably would have been brilliant. The troubled mechanic, who is Blanchett's friend, was a much more interesting storyline, for one, and he certainly presented some high conflicts going on within his own life for added film tension.  Blanchett's character and her way of life, with the visions, set in this gothic southern atmosphere needed no other props.

Keanu Reeves plays the abusive husband of one of her clients (Hillary Swank). He feels threatened by Blanchett and threatens her several times, but the local law enforcement shuns her complaint against him. Greg Kinnear is the principal of the school Blanchett's children attends, and the two of them have a definite attraction for one another. When Kinnear's fiancee (Katie Holmes)disappears, her father asks Blanchett to use her telepathic abilities to find his daughter. Enduring criticism and disbelief, Blanchett dreams of the young woman and leads the local authories to a pond on Reeves's land, where her body is dragged from the pond. Reeves is arrested and tried, but Blanchett suspects he isn't the one who killed the young woman.I've seen this movie twice and enjoyed it both times I watched it. I usually find Cate Blanchett's acting aloof and distant, but she portrays her character with warmth and caring.

""cscotts""","[9, 9]","Though I seem to be in the minority on this one, THE GIFT was one of the most exceptionally made films that I've seen in quite some time.  Working with a script that has a twist for every turn that's made, Sam Raimi manages to provide several neat twists to what could have been a really tired story. The crux of the film is that there has been a murder in the film's small Georgia town, and with no leads, the police resort to seeking the counsel of the local psychic, played by Blanchett.  As with most of her previous work, Cate Blanchett again owns the movie--unlike some of her contemporaries(namely the talented but sometimes ill-used Gwyneth Paltrow), Blanchett manages to flesh out any character that she's given, no matter how bad of a stinker movie she's in, but lucky for us she's in a pretty good one here.  The rest of the casting is a mixed bag somewhat.  Greg Kinnear plays the male lead, effective but not extraordinary, and the same can be said of Katie Holmes, sporting an overripe Southern accent as his fiancee.  Keanu Reeves surprises as a backwoods wife-beater--he makes the best of a small role, easily his best acting since MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO(it's sometimes hard to forget that at one point in his career he actually ACTED).  Oscar winner Hilary Swank plays Reeves' human punching bag, in a variation on her BOYS DON'T CRY role-she's also memorable, but needs to branch out from playing these victim roles.  Rounding out the cast, Giovanni Ribisi again overracts in his umpteenth role as a mentally challenged individual, this time playing a client of Blanchett's psychic character. Again, Blanchett holds this superb film together--shame on the Oscars for not recognizing genre films, because Blanchett gave a truly nuanced, Oscar-worthy performance.",5,First-Rate Thriller,998006400,"08 17, 2001",2001,1777,"['seem', 'be', 'minority', 'one', 'GIFT', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'exceptionally', 'made', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'Working', 'script', 'twist', 'turn', 'made', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'provide', 'several', 'neat', 'twists', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'tired', 'story', 'crux', 'film', 'been', 'murder', 'film', 'small', 'Georgia', 'town', 'leads', 'police', 'resort', 'seeking', 'counsel', 'local', 'psychic', 'played', 'Blanchett', 'most', 'previous', 'work', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'again', 'movie', 'contemporaries', 'namely', 'talented', 'sometimes', 'ill-used', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Blanchett', 'flesh', 'out', 'character', 'given', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'stinker', 'movie', 'lucky', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'here', 'rest', 'casting', 'mixed', 'bag', 'somewhat', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'male', 'lead', 'effective', 'not', 'extraordinary', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'sporting', 'overripe', 'Southern', 'accent', 'fiancee', 'Keanu', 'surprises', 'backwoods', 'wife-beater', 'best', 'small', 'role', 'easily', 'best', 'acting', 'MY', 'OWN', 'PRIVATE', 'IDAHO', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'forget', 'one', 'point', 'career', 'actually', 'ACTED', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Reeves', 'human', 'punching', 'bag', 'variation', 'BOYS', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'CRY', 'role-she', 'also', 'memorable', 'branch', 'out', 'playing', 'victim', 'roles', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'again', 'umpteenth', 'role', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'individual', 'time', 'playing', 'client', 'Blanchett', 'psychic', 'character', 'Again', 'Blanchett', 'superb', 'film', 'together', 'shame', 'Oscars', 'not', 'recognizing', 'genre', 'films', 'Blanchett', 'gave', 'truly', 'nuanced', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance']",N/A

Well The Gift is one of the better horror films of recent years, and with names like Sam Raimi and Billy Bob Thornton behind the scenes, well, it's almost expected that's it of high quality.Annie (Cate Blanchett) is a psychic reader in a small town in the South, whose clientele consists mostly of the troubled people in town looking for answers. One of these is Valerie Barksdale (Hilary Swank), who looks to Annie for advice when her husband Donnie (Keanu Reeves) beats her. Donnie doesn't much care for Annie, calling her a witch and threatening physical violence if she continues to speak with his wife.One day a young woman named Jessica King (Katie Holmes) goes missing, and one of Annie's haunting visions leads the woman's fiancee Wayne (Greg Kinnear) and local law enforcement to a pond on Donnie Barksdale's property, where her body is found. Donnie is fairly quickly convicted of the crime, but once he's in jail, Annie doesn't feel any better, and she's beginning to think that Donnie may not have killed her at all. Another of her clients, a mentally unstable young man named Buddy (Giovanni Ribisi) has been acting especially strange lately, and Annie saw the prosecutor (Gary Cole) having sex with Jessica the night before her death. Meanwhile, she's also been having increasingly disturbing nightmares involving water and strangulation, and she fears for her own life.The Gift is really quite well done. The acting is pretty stellar, especially surprising to me, since the cast contains two actors, Keanu Reeves and Giovanni Ribisi, whose work I'm generally not fond of, but everyone holds their weight here. There are several taut, suspenseful scenes that get the heart rate going with fearful anticipation, and the reason they are so effective is because of the character buildup that has taken place prior.A lot of filmmakers believe that to scare the audience, you must show something scary on screen, but the scariest stuff always resides in the mind of the viewer, and director Raimi knows that, and puts this knowledge to good use. Fans of conventional horror films with vampires, demons, and zombies probably won't find what they're looking for in The Gift, but fans of psychological thrillers will be more than pleased with what The Gift offers.",4,A horror movie for smart movie watchers?

She plays a psychic named Annie, tormented by visions of a local girl's death and by the death of her husband, who she was not able to save.  Her performance is the driving force behind this movie, which, without her, would have been somewhat mediocre.Director Sam Raimi does a good job at creating a Hitchcockian suspense, and there are several opportunities in the movie for goosebumps to form on the back of your neck, but there are few true thrills.  The movie works much like THE OTHERS and THE SIXTH SENSE by employing several tricks, like a subtle twist at the end or the use of color to denote mood and tone.The movie becomes a little hokey sometimes, especially when Hilary Swank is on the screen.  Her performance, while still good, was my least favorite.  The only scene where she truly delivers is when her husband, played to the hilt by Keanu Reeves, discovers her at Annie's house getting a reading.  Her face truly conveys the character's fear and ""Oh no, here we go again"" quality.  Giovanni Ribisi is effective as a mentally retarded boy who frighteningly confronts his father about his childhood abuse, but he also seems to just be playing an unstable version of his character in THE OTHER SISTER.  Other smaller characters, played by Gary Cole, Katie Holmes, and Rosemary Harris, are also effective.  Greg Kinnear is also good, but he seems a little out of joint, a little slippery when wet.The movie delivers atmosphere and mood in maximum proportions, complete with all the eccentricities of a small Southern town, and apart from its slight wanderings into redneck territory, it entertains and keeps you guessing until the very end, well, almost until the very end.",4,"Chilling, but not thrilling....",1024099200,"06 15, 2002",2002,1825,"['Cate', 'Blanchett', 'chameleon', 'actress', 'played', 'queens', 'yuppies', 'harlots', 'gamblers', 'stretch', 'GIFT', 'psychic', 'named', 'Annie', 'tormented', 'visions', 'local', 'girl', 'death', 'death', 'husband', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'save', 'performance', 'driving', 'force', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'mediocre.Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'good', 'job', 'creating', 'Hitchcockian', 'suspense', 'are', 'several', 'opportunities', 'movie', 'goosebumps', 'form', 'back', 'neck', 'are', 'few', 'true', 'thrills', 'movie', 'much', 'THE', 'OTHERS', 'THE', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'employing', 'several', 'tricks', 'subtle', 'twist', 'end', 'use', 'color', 'denote', 'mood', 'tone.The', 'movie', 'little', 'hokey', 'sometimes', 'especially', 'when', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'screen', 'performance', 'still', 'good', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'only', 'scene', 'where', 'truly', 'delivers', 'when', 'husband', 'played', 'hilt', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Annie', 'house', 'getting', 'reading', 'face', 'truly', 'character', 'fear', 'Oh', 'here', 'go', 'again', 'quality', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'effective', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'boy', 'who', 'frighteningly', 'father', 'childhood', 'abuse', 'also', 'just', 'be', 'playing', 'unstable', 'version', 'character', 'THE', 'OTHER', 'SISTER', 'Other', 'smaller', 'characters', 'played', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'are', 'also', 'effective', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'also', 'good', 'little', 'joint', 'little', 'slippery', 'when', 'wet.The', 'movie', 'delivers', 'atmosphere', 'mood', 'maximum', 'proportions', 'complete', 'eccentricities', 'small', 'Southern', 'town', 'apart', 'slight', 'wanderings', 'redneck', 'territory', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'well', 'almost', 'very', 'end']",N/A

But Cate Blanchett's stellar performance overwhelmed my doubts about this movie. And, the touching conclusion was worth the wait, as far as I am concerned.Blanchett portrays a woman with three young children. She must support them alone because her husband died in a work accident. So, she does ""readings"" for local folks, and answers their questions. They give her ""donations"" that help her scrape along. And she does indeed have some extrasensory ability. It all seems hokey, but Blanchett is very convincing as a compassionate woman. She makes her audience believe that she really cares. Simply put, she carries this movie.One of her clients (Hilary Swank) is a victim of domestic violence. This client's abusive husband (Keanu Reeves) is accused of murdering another woman. Blanchett has visions/dreams that involve this murder.The film convincingly projects a small town/rural atmosphere of people who know everybody's business. Much of the cinematography is impressive with captivating images of the deep dark swampland and stagnant ponds in the back country near Savannah, Georgia. Woven throughout is a sense of menace that seems almost palpable. Another big plus is the performance of J.K. Simmons as the local sheriff. It's a rather small role, but Simmons works it for all it's worth.

Keanu Reeves actually frightened me with his portrayal of the abusive, controlling, and womanizing husband of Hillary Swank.  Giovanni Ribisi's character is compelling and complicated.  As the drama unfolds, his character proves to be the most complicated to me.  Highly enjoyable film.

Bannister,"[0, 0]","What could and should have been an excellent movie was ruined by the playhouse acting of Cate Blanchett in the role of a small town psychic who through her own imcompetence gets embroiled in a town murder. It could be that the fault lies with the director for surely Blanchett could not have devised such a goofy take on this character by herself. They took what should have been a pleasant rural quirky character and instead gave us some Shakespearian tortured card-reading soul. This role shows that there are not many tools at all in the Blanchett acting bag and that it would be best if she stuck with historical pieces. At least then one assumes her suffering will be in a context that will be appropriate.From the town crazy played by Keanu Reeves to the town's battered wife (Hilary Swank), from the location, to the storyline this movie had the ingredients.

Director Sam Raimi currently undertaking the new Spiderman motion picture release and helming past works like Army of Darkness does an incredible job of using the dark treacherous elements from the nature to enhance the mystery. No less credible is the ensemble of seasoned cast where Cate Blanchett is overlooked for her elegant and evocative performance as a psychic who is enlisted to help solve the murder of the promiscuous Katie Holmes by his distressed fiance portrayed by Greg Kinnear.Keanu Reeves gives a devilish performance as an unscrupulous wife-abuser and racist; Hilary Swank as his suffering yet clueless wife and Giovanni Ribsini as a schizophrenic friend of the local psychic. The script written by Billy Bob Thornton (A Silple Plan and Sling Blade) continues his observation with human foibles and violence. The quirky and flawed characters usually turn out to show surprising nuances as in Buddy (Ribsini).

583593,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005JH9M,D. Litton,"[5, 5]","It's a rare treat to sit down to a movie that winds the chord of suspense and never stops, not even after it's all over. That's what so special about &quot;The Gift,&quot; a pyschic thriller about a woman who, through an extraordinary power, becomes the only witness to a crime she never even saw. But the movie is more than a thriller with brains: it's also a character study, digging deep into its characters, their motivations, and what drives them to do the things they do. Many will think that the film attempts to deal with too much at once; I happen to think it's one of the best pictures of the year.The movie takes its time in introducing us to the characters, which allows itself to set the stage for events that will take place later. Cate Blanchett, in her best role since &quot;Elizabeth,&quot; is Annie Wilson, widowed mother of three who lives in a small town and raises her three boys on social security money from her husband's death, and by reading fortunes for those who come to her. Her visions, however, are not always kind, nor do they always come during a session. Upon meeting the school principle, Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear), and his fiancee, Jessica (Katie Holmes), Annie gets an uneasy feeling, not to mention a few intense images.Soon, Jessica turns up missing, but not before the movie leaves us many clues that will lead to pointing fingers at various characters. Each character can be considered a suspect: Donnie Barksdale (Keanu Reeves), in whose pond the victim's body was found; his wife, Valerie (Hilary Swank), who admits to having bitter thoughts about Jessica for having slept with her husband; prosecutor David Duncan (Gary Cole), whom Annie caught having an affair with the victim... the list goes on.In a completely engrossing twist of events, things get harried after Donnie is arrested for the murder of Jessica, and is soon put away after being found guilty at his trial. But still, Annie cannot shake the feeling that, after all that has passed, there is still some stone that has yet to be turned.And through it all, Annie remains a stable and defiant woman, and under the acting of Blanchett, she is made all the more believable. As with her character Queen Elizabeth, Blanchett takes a forceful approach with the role, portraying her as a loving mother and a woman who refuses to give in to those who would intimidate her simply because of her gift. Even in the most intense sequences that take place in Annie's mind, through all the fear on her face, there is still that small degree of strength that makes Blanchett such a believable actress.All around, the performances from the rest of the cast are stellar, one of the best ensemble casts for a motion picture in the year 2000. Actors Greg Kinnear, Keanu Reeves, Katie Holmes, Hilary Swank, and Giovanni Ribisi, are able to infuse a certain aura of mystery about into their characters, which is important when it comes to trying to solve the movie's many twists and mysteries.Each of the characters possesses an emotional instability that the film portrays. Valerie Barksdale feels alone and empty after her husband's imprisonment, even though he profusely beat her before his arrest. The town sheriff claims to disbelieve in fortune telling, but cannot deny the strange circumstances that lead to the discovery of the victim's body. And Buddy Cole (Giovanni Ribisi) is haunted by a childhood experience that will play a later role in the movie. The movie makes the right decision by bringing out the emotional depth of its various characters rather than keep them on the sidelines as the mystery surrounding the murder unfolds.The film's many twists and mysteries are some of the most intricately woven of any movie I've seen. Each twist is like a scream in the night, all leading up to a climax that is somewhat subtle yet very impacting. Throughout the movie, I was not without that tight feeling in my stomach as I watched in anticipation of what would happen next; it's very rare that a movie can have such an effect on me.For all of its brilliance, &quot;The Gift&quot; receives four stars, resting on a very involving whodunit mystery with a psychic twist and a story that stays in tune with each of its characters. Like it's main protagonist, the movie has a gift of examining each person, and weaving them into the mystery to keep its secrets hidden until the end. It may not win many awards, but it has won my heart.",5,A &quot;gift&quot; from the movie gods!,995328000,"07 17, 2001",2001,4431,"['rare', 'treat', 'sit', 'down', 'movie', 'chord', 'suspense', 'never', 'stops', 'not', 'even', 'over', 'what', 'so', 'special', 'quot', 'Gift', 'quot', 'pyschic', 'thriller', 'woman', 'who', 'extraordinary', 'power', 'only', 'witness', 'crime', 'never', 'even', 'saw', 'movie', 'more', 'thriller', 'brains', 'also', 'character', 'study', 'digging', 'deep', 'characters', 'motivations', 'what', 'do', 'things', 'do', 'Many', 'will', 'think', 'film', 'attempts', 'deal', 'too', 'much', 'once', 'happen', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'pictures', 'year.The', 'movie', 'time', 'introducing', 'characters', 'set', 'stage', 'events', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'later', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'best', 'role', 'quot', 'Elizabeth', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Wilson', 'widowed', 'mother', 'three', 'who', 'small', 'town', 'three', 'boys', 'social', 'security', 'money', 'husband', 'death', 'reading', 'fortunes', 'who', 'come', 'visions', 'however', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'kind', 'do', 'always', 'come', 'session', 'meeting', 'school', 'principle', 'Wayne', 'Collins', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'fiancee', 'Jessica', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Annie', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'not', 'mention', 'few', 'intense', 'images.Soon', 'Jessica', 'up', 'missing', 'not', 'movie', 'many', 'clues', 'will', 'lead', 'pointing', 'fingers', 'various', 'characters', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'suspect', 'Donnie', 'Barksdale', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'pond', 'victim', 'body', 'was', 'found', 'wife', 'Valerie', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'who', 'having', 'bitter', 'thoughts', 'Jessica', 'having', 'slept', 'husband', 'prosecutor', 'David', 'Duncan', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'whom', 'Annie', 'caught', 'having', 'affair', 'victim', 'list', 'on.In', 'completely', 'engrossing', 'twist', 'events', 'things', 'get', 'harried', 'Donnie', 'arrested', 'murder', 'Jessica', 'soon', 'put', 'away', 'being', 'found', 'guilty', 'trial', 'still', 'Annie', 'can', 'not', 'shake', 'feeling', 'passed', 'still', 'stone', 'yet', 'be', 'turned.And', 'Annie', 'stable', 'defiant', 'woman', 'acting', 'Blanchett', 'made', 'more', 'believable', 'character', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Blanchett', 'forceful', 'approach', 'role', 'portraying', 'loving', 'mother', 'woman', 'who', 'give', 'who', 'would', 'intimidate', 'simply', 'gift', 'Even', 'most', 'intense', 'sequences', 'take', 'place', 'Annie', 'mind', 'fear', 'face', 'still', 'small', 'degree', 'strength', 'Blanchett', 'believable', 'actress.All', 'around', 'performances', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'stellar', 'one', 'best', 'ensemble', 'casts', 'motion', 'picture', 'year', '2000', 'Actors', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'are', 'able', 'infuse', 'certain', 'aura', 'mystery', 'characters', 'important', 'when', 'trying', 'solve', 'movie', 'many', 'twists', 'mysteries.Each', 'characters', 'emotional', 'instability', 'film', 'portrays', 'Valerie', 'Barksdale', 'alone', 'empty', 'husband', 'imprisonment', 'even', 'profusely', 'beat', 'arrest', 'town', 'sheriff', 'claims', 'disbelieve', 'fortune', 'telling', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'strange', 'circumstances', 'lead', 'discovery', 'victim', 'body', 'Buddy', 'Cole', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'haunted', 'childhood', 'experience', 'will', 'play', 'later', 'role', 'movie', 'movie', 'right', 'decision', 'bringing', 'out', 'emotional', 'depth', 'various', 'characters', 'rather', 'keep', 'sidelines', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'murder', 'unfolds.The', 'film', 'many', 'twists', 'mysteries', 'are', 'most', 'intricately', 'woven', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twist', 'scream', 'night', 'leading', 'up', 'climax', 'somewhat', 'subtle', 'yet', 'very', 'impacting', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'tight', 'feeling', 'stomach', 'watched', 'anticipation', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'very', 'rare', 'movie', 'can', 'have', 'such', 'effect', 'me.For', 'brilliance', 'quot', 'Gift', 'quot', 'four', 'stars', 'resting', 'very', 'involving', 'whodunit', 'mystery', 'psychic', 'twist', 'story', 'tune', 'characters', 'main', 'protagonist', 'movie', 'gift', 'examining', 'person', 'weaving', 'mystery', 'keep', 'secrets', 'hidden', 'end', 'may', 'not', 'win', 'many', 'awards', 'won', 'heart']",N/A

It is a somewhat dubious gift over which Blanchett has uncertain control, and one which arouses fear, anger, and interest in her neighbors in a small community in the rural South.At the heart of the story is a missing town girl, to whose fate Cate is a remote and incomplete witness via her gift.  The plot offers up a number of potential suspects, and follows Blanchett as she wrestles with her fragmentary vision of the event and a dubious Southern accent.

583597,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B00005JH9M,Duane Thomas,"[3, 3]","The Gift is a murder mystery. Annie Wilson, a small town Georgia psychic, begins to have visions that, while not cluing her into the identity of the murderer - at least to start - do let her know a murder has been committed. The angry spirit of the murder victim prods Annie, none too gently, toward solving the crime which eventually, of course, brings her into conflict with the murderer.Cate Blanchett plays Annie Wilson wonderfully well, as a woman of great decency and empathy. Her body language when she feels threatened - hunched shoulders, avoidance of eye contact - show she's had her share of hard knocks in life. But beyond that, there's a hard core of stubbornness inside her, that allows her to continue on, to love and be a great mother to her kids, to hold onto some sense of dignity and self-respect, all the while dealing with a ""gift"" that's truly more a curse.  It's impossible not to respect Annie, and like her, and root for her, to care what happens to her.  While not conventionally movie star beautiful, Cate's Annie manages to be extremely appealing. The thing that makes he so attractive is that Annie's obviously, totally unaware she's sexy. Watching The Gift was the first time I've ever seen Cate Blanchett in a movie. After this, I want to see more.  I'm going to have to check out Catherine in short order.Keanu Reeves does a superb job as redneck wifebeater, Donnie Barksdale. This is an Ed Harris-level example of chameleon-like immersal in a character. I can give no higher compliment.  Those who deride Reeves' acting abilities have never watched The Gift. When Reeves plays Donnie, he IS the character.  Everything about him changes from what we're used to thinking of as ""Keanu Reeves"" - body language, vocal tone, speech patterns, everything is different. Really, the only thing recognizably Keanu Reeves is bone structure. My girlfriend, watching the movie with me, didn't even recognize him at first.I was very impressed with Katie Holmes as Jessica King, the murder victim. Comparing Kate's Jessica King to Hannah Green, the character she played in Wonder Boys, shows she's a talented actress with an impressive range, she can play very different characters and be completely convincing in the roles. In Wonder Boys she was totally believable as a young woman of intelligence, sensitivity and kindness.  In The Gift she's totally believable as a stupid, self-centered, spoiled slut.  One can but hope the first role is closer to her real personality than the second (he said, jokingly).Giovanni Ribisi's portrayal of Buddy Cole, specifically his scene talking to Annie in a parked car toward the end of the movie, is one of the most touching things I've ever seen in a movie.Okay, so the murder ""mystery"" isn't much of a mystery.

However, the movie has some pretty obvious influences and even though I like all of its forebears, I was never impressed with its originality.  Cate Blanchett plays a single mother with fuzzy abilities to predict the future and see scenes from the past that she wasn't present for.  The plot concerns a vicious murder which she is called on to help solve.  It's a potentially compelling storyline, but I've seen it before: the victim is a secretly promiscuous daughter of a local businessman, we are shown the dark underbelly of a small town, there are confusing dream sequences related to the murder -- it was like watching ""Twin Peaks"" again.  Those who have seen ""The Sixth Sense"" will also experience deja vu when they see ""The Gift"".  I even was reminded a bit of ""Eve's Bayou"".Also, ""The Gift"" is supposed to be creepy, but it relies too much on the hoary device of close-up shots of Blanchett when we know that someone who may-or-may-not be threatening lurks behind her.  The only points where I was scared during the movie were during the surreal dream sequences; a one-second shot of a fiddler in a swamp was somehow especially frightening.  The director of ""The Gift"" (Sam Raimi) also did ""A Simple Plan"", a movie I loved -- in that one he did a great job of creating a forbidding mood and misdirecting the viewer.  In ""The Gift"" there is the standard cycling through different ""obvious"" murder suspects and not as much real suspense, in my opinion.I don't mean to complain too much, though -- I still enjoy a good supernatural swamp noir, which this movie is, and the acting is decent.  Katie Holmes appears have grown a foot and a half to play a tall young southern socialite, Keanu Reeves is fine as a snarling wife-beater, Giovanni Ribisi is effectively over-the-top as an emotionally disturbed mechanic, Greg Kinnear does his sweet-guy thing, and Cate Blanchett shines as the gifted woman trying to raise her boys while working as a ""reader"".  Even if she didn't have three kids in this movie she'd still come off as warm and maternal -- she takes responsibility for all of the people who come to her to get their future read.  She's great.  ...All in all I think ""The Gift"" is worth watching; it effectively cobbles together elements of other supernatural whodunits and does a credible job of creating the small-town-with-dark-secrets setting that David Lynch has popularized.",3,"Nice movie -- not too original, but I love Blanchett",1015200000,"03 4, 2002",2002,2517,"['would', 'have', 'liked', 'give', 'Gift', 'higher', 'rating', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'ten', 'twelve', 'years', 'ago', 'However', 'movie', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'influences', 'even', 'like', 'forebears', 'was', 'never', 'impressed', 'originality', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'single', 'mother', 'fuzzy', 'abilities', 'predict', 'future', 'see', 'scenes', 'past', 'was', ""n't"", 'present', 'plot', 'vicious', 'murder', 'called', 'help', 'solve', 'potentially', 'compelling', 'storyline', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'victim', 'secretly', 'promiscuous', 'daughter', 'local', 'businessman', 'are', 'shown', 'dark', 'underbelly', 'small', 'town', 'are', 'confusing', 'dream', 'sequences', 'related', 'murder', 'was', 'watching', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'again', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'will', 'also', 'experience', 'deja', 'vu', 'when', 'see', 'Gift', 'even', 'was', 'reminded', 'bit', 'Eve', 'Bayou', '.Also', 'Gift', 'supposed', 'be', 'creepy', 'too', 'much', 'hoary', 'device', 'close-up', 'shots', 'Blanchett', 'when', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'may-or-may-not', 'be', 'threatening', 'lurks', 'only', 'points', 'where', 'was', 'scared', 'movie', 'were', 'surreal', 'dream', 'sequences', 'one-second', 'shot', 'fiddler', 'swamp', 'was', 'somehow', 'especially', 'frightening', 'director', 'Gift', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'also', 'did', 'A', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'movie', 'loved', 'one', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'forbidding', 'mood', 'misdirecting', 'viewer', 'Gift', 'standard', 'cycling', 'different', 'obvious', 'murder', 'suspects', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'real', 'suspense', 'opinion.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'still', 'enjoy', 'good', 'supernatural', 'swamp', 'noir', 'movie', 'acting', 'decent', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'have', 'grown', 'foot', 'half', 'play', 'tall', 'young', 'southern', 'socialite', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'fine', 'snarling', 'wife-beater', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'effectively', 'over-the-top', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'mechanic', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'sweet-guy', 'thing', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'shines', 'gifted', 'woman', 'trying', 'raise', 'boys', 'working', 'reader', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'three', 'kids', 'movie', ""'d"", 'still', 'come', 'off', 'warm', 'maternal', 'responsibility', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'get', 'future', 'read', 'great', 'think', 'Gift', 'worth', 'watching', 'effectively', 'together', 'elements', 'other', 'supernatural', 'whodunits', 'credible', 'job', 'creating', 'small-town-with-dark-secrets', 'setting', 'David', 'Lynch', 'popularized']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[22, 27]","""The Gift""'s biggest gift is Cate Blanchett, who expertly carries the entire plotline as a tarot-card reader in the deep South. This film suffers from one or two problematic actors and some cheesy visuals, but it's otherwise very creepy.Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett) lost her husband in an explosion, and now supports her three sons on her tarot-card readings, which use her psychic ""gift."" Among the people who seek her help are Buddy (Giovanni Ribisi), a young man scarred by childhood molestation, and Valerie (Hilary Swank), a weak young woman who lives in terror of her violent redneck husband Donnie (Keanu Reeves). Worse, Donnie is threatening both Annie and her children, claiming that she's a Satan-worshipper and a witch because of her tarot readings.When Jessica (Katie Holmes), the seductive fiancee of a friend vanishes, Annie begins to have visions of what may have happened. The visions of white flowers, fences, and pondwater lead Annie and the skeptical police chief to Donnie's land, where the girl's body is found in the pond. Though at first Annie is convinced that Donnie is the one who murdered Jessica, her gift leads her to believe otherwise.This movie just brims over with ""Southernness,"" with lots of moss, mist, bigoted rednecks, swampy forests and dirty little secrets. It's not an amazing movie, despite the good actors and good direction, partly because many parts of it are a bit cliched. But it's haunting and creepy, and those who enjoyed ""The Sixth Sense"" may also enjoy ""The Gift."" (Annie sees dead people too!)Cate Blanchett is, as always, stunning in whatever role she plays. This time it's a sort of tarot-reading madonna, and her expressive eyes and face can instantly flip from one emotion to another. Greg Kinnear plays Jessica's haunted fiancee, who has an eye for Annie; Hilary Swank is also very good as Valerie, as are the three boys who play Annie's children. Keanu Reeves was a problem, though. He's supposed to be a violent, cheating, raging redneck, but he wasn't very convincing.Probably to call this a horror film isn't quite accurate. Though it's very creepy and horrific, it isn't gory or truly horrific. (The most horrifying scene doesn't involve dead people or visions, but the sexually-abused Buddy crying, shrieking and attacking his father) Actually, it sags when we get things like visions of Jessica, or rolling stormclouds -- these are a little too obvious for the otherwise eerie movie. And I was able to guess quite quickly who the murderer was, simply by considering who it would be too easy to think it was.""The Gift"" isn't an astounding movie, but quite a watchable one.

583601,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JH9M,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 6]","This is surely one of the most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around, which is a shame since director Sam Raimi, just before hitting the jackpot with the ""Spider-Man"" franchise, has assembled a wildly improbable cast to inhabit an admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie. I was in a town on the southernmost tip of Chile when I first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have HBO. Not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the TV set back then.Co-written by Billy Bob Thornton (upon whose mother's psychic gifts the story is based) and Tom Epperson, the plot revolves around the disappearance of Jessica Starlet, the daughter of a wealthy resident of a Georgia backwater town. Tired of blind alleys, the police begrudgingly recruit Annie Wilson, a single mother of three sons, who lost her husband in a factory accident and now has to earn a living as a tarot reading psychic/fortune teller. Annie thinks she finds a suspect in Donnie Barksdale, the abusive, white-trash husband of one of her most devoted customers, Valerie.  Complicating matters for Annie is her attraction to Wayne Collins, her eldest son's teacher and Jessica's fiancee; and Buddy Cole, another of Annie's customers, a suicidal mechanic traumatized by the parental abuse he received as a child.While it's not perfectly constructed, the sometimes excessive screenplay contains a lot of layers but remains true to the characters' voices and motivations throughout. Raimi's expert direction is full of sumptuous Southern gothic visuals and genuine tension that escalates over the course of the story. Credit needs to be given to Jamie Anderson's cinematography and Neil Spisak's production design for establishing such a heady atmosphere perfect for the labyrinth plot. Some of the actors really surprised me with strong turns, including Katie Holmes as the spoiled, baby-faced debutante Jessica; Greg Kinnear as the seemingly stalwart Wayne; Keanu Reeves especially visceral and chilling as unrepentant wife-beater Donnie; and Giovanni Ribisi as the deeply troubled Buddy.In the smallish role of Valerie, Hilary Swank makes her moments count as she cringes from Donnie's scarifying dominance over her. But it's the wondrous Cate Blanchett who pulls it all together with her multi-dimensional performance as Annie. With a convincing Southern accent, she reveals the hidden layers of her character beautifully as she tries to recover from the loss of her husband, protect her children and make sense of the psychic revelations that traumatize her and us.  The DVD is short on extras - a fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast and crew interviews, the movie's trailer and a video of Neko Case's ""Furniture Room Lullaby"" which perfectly reflects the haunting soundtrack. Definitely seek this one out if you are looking for an atmospheric, character-driven thriller that does not condescend to the viewer.",4,"Shamefully Overlooked Southern Gothic Murder Mystery Has Atmosphere, Genuine Thrills and the Superb Blanchett",1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,2967,"['surely', 'one', 'most', 'seriously', 'underrated', 'mystery', 'thrillers', 'shame', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'just', 'hitting', 'jackpot', 'Spider-Man', 'franchise', 'assembled', 'wildly', 'improbable', 'cast', 'inhabit', 'admittedly', 'lurid', 'constantly', 'involving', '2001', 'movie', 'was', 'town', 'southernmost', 'tip', 'Chile', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'hotel', 'room', 'just', 'happen', 'have', 'HBO', 'Not', 'even', 'outside', 'splendor', 'midnight', 'sun', 'could', 'tear', 'away', 'watching', 'movie', 'TV', 'set', 'back', 'then.Co-written', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'mother', 'psychic', 'gifts', 'story', 'based', 'Tom', 'Epperson', 'plot', 'disappearance', 'Jessica', 'Starlet', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'resident', 'Georgia', 'backwater', 'town', 'Tired', 'blind', 'alleys', 'police', 'begrudgingly', 'Annie', 'Wilson', 'single', 'mother', 'three', 'sons', 'who', 'lost', 'husband', 'factory', 'accident', 'now', 'earn', 'living', 'tarot', 'reading', 'psychic/fortune', 'teller', 'Annie', 'suspect', 'Donnie', 'Barksdale', 'abusive', 'white-trash', 'husband', 'one', 'most', 'devoted', 'customers', 'Valerie', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'Annie', 'attraction', 'Wayne', 'Collins', 'eldest', 'son', 'teacher', 'Jessica', 'fiancee', 'Buddy', 'Cole', 'Annie', 'customers', 'suicidal', 'mechanic', 'traumatized', 'parental', 'abuse', 'received', 'child.While', 'not', 'perfectly', 'constructed', 'sometimes', 'excessive', 'screenplay', 'lot', 'layers', 'true', 'characters', 'voices', 'motivations', 'Raimi', 'expert', 'direction', 'full', 'sumptuous', 'Southern', 'gothic', 'visuals', 'genuine', 'tension', 'course', 'story', 'Credit', 'be', 'given', 'Jamie', 'Anderson', 'cinematography', 'Neil', 'Spisak', 'production', 'design', 'establishing', 'heady', 'atmosphere', 'perfect', 'labyrinth', 'plot', 'actors', 'really', 'surprised', 'strong', 'turns', 'including', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'spoiled', 'baby-faced', 'debutante', 'Jessica', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'seemingly', 'stalwart', 'Wayne', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'especially', 'visceral', 'chilling', 'unrepentant', 'wife-beater', 'Donnie', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'Buddy.In', 'smallish', 'role', 'Valerie', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'moments', 'count', 'Donnie', 'scarifying', 'dominance', 'wondrous', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'together', 'multi-dimensional', 'performance', 'Annie', 'convincing', 'Southern', 'accent', 'hidden', 'layers', 'character', 'beautifully', 'recover', 'loss', 'husband', 'protect', 'children', 'make', 'sense', 'psychic', 'revelations', 'traumatize', 'DVD', 'short', 'extras', 'fifteen-minute', 'featurette', 'cast', 'crew', 'interviews', 'movie', 'trailer', 'video', 'Neko', 'Case', 'Furniture', 'Room', 'Lullaby', 'perfectly', 'haunting', 'soundtrack', 'Definitely', 'seek', 'one', 'are', 'looking', 'atmospheric', 'character-driven', 'thriller', 'not', 'condescend', 'viewer']",N/A

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 1]","A marvelous little gem of a film, THE GIFT takes terrific advantage (and greats great mileage) of Cate Blanchett, an Academy Award caliber actress who plays Annie Wilson, an every day Southerner (and the drawl is perfectly hypnotic) who has an explanable gift of reading cards to see a person's past, present, or future ... the story takes a few too many chances to nail down her precognition to any one era of the film's life.Widowed and raising three boys on her own, Annie decides to use her gift and accept charitable donations from those who seek her out for her fortune-telling advice.  However, when one of her client's husbands (played to surprisingly good results by Keanu Reeves) takes offense to the advice being provided his abused wife, Annie begins to question even the use of her own gift for every day benefit.The death of an area socialite (Katie Holmes, who bares her feminine wiles here, folks) brings the police calling, broadening the narrative scope of who in town could possibly be the killer.  While never 'seeing' him commit the act, Annie perceives his guilt, and the abusive husband is taken away.  It doesn't take long for her to realize that she has misused her talent and, perhaps, placed the wrong man behind bars.The film's greatest strength is Blanchett.  Photographed with an aura of beauty typically reserved from screen sirens the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer, Blanchett is magnetic; her beauty is as deftly committed to celluloid as is her psychic ability, and, while saying little, she commands a presence while onscreen that outshines nearly any weakness in a script reminescent of territory normally reserved for TV's THE X FILES.If THE GIFT has any faults, it's perhaps that it succumbs into a kind of audience-induced predictability in its latter half, a fault very common to many thrillers who drop the act of subtlety.  The innocent is played up to be the killer, and the killer is played up to be the victim; however, a wry little twist saves the ending from being entirely formulaic, leaving the viewer something to think about instead of a bad taste in the mouth.",4,A Rare Gem Of A Film ...

And these are only the top six.  There are solid performances not only from these six, but several supporting roles that make this a great demonstration of the craft.Standing out in my eyes among all the performances is Keanu Reeves.  He plays not only a total skunk, but a potentially dangerous total skunk in a refreshing change of roles.  But what makes the movie interesting is that he may or may not be the worst of the bunch.  There are other members of the cast who have their own negative and/or violent capabilities.The title refers to powers that lead actress Cate Blanchett posesses as part of her psychic profession.  She is recently widowed, barely scraping by with her family, and making a living by reading cards for people.  She is regarded with disdain by some in town, and amusement by others.  But there is also a large enough clientle in town that hang on her every word.  This group consists mostly of strongly stereotyped poor white trash.My problem with the movie is what exactly constitutes her ""Gift"".  I went through the film twice, and pulled in a lot more the second time based on what you know from the first viewing.  But to me it never becomes clear EXACTLY what these powers are.  Moreover, she not only doesn't have a grasp of what they are, but by the movie's end, is still far from being able to control them.  This almost gets her killed, and I got the feeling of being unsatisfied the way they left it.Still, I recommend it, and would probably pick up more with further viewings.

The plot is extremely predictable.  If they hung a big sign on the killer that said ""MURDERER"", it couldn't have been more obvious than the way director Sam Raimi constructed the story around Billy Bob Thornton's screenplay.Kate Blanchett does a good job as the fortune teller, although I wouldn't put it on a par with ""Elizabeth"".  However, she does capture the essence of the poor southern mom right down to the accent, no small accomplishment for an Australian actor for whom her character must have seemed like a bit of a cultural enigma.  Keanu Reeves seems to be trying very hard to shed his good guy image, following his performance as a psychopathic killer in the ""The Watcher"" with this role as an evil country boy.  I would have to say that he was more convincing as a bad guy in this film than ""The Watcher"", but he is still not cut out for the villain roles.Katie Holmes is another actor who uses this film to attempt to break out of her mold as the sweet teen.  She tries hard to play the shrew, spicing it up with some R rated nudity and profanity, but ultimately comes across as spoiled sarcastic brat, landing not far from the teen perception she is trying to shed.  This is a step backwards for her after a very solid performance in ""Wonder Boys"".  Greg Kinnear is awful as Mr. Perfect schoolteacher, and his attempt at creating romantic tension between his character and Blanchett's is abysmally inept.And then there is Ribisi.  I have liked Giovanni in every role in which I've seen him.  The kid can flat-out act.  Here he outclasses the entire cast with a gut wrenching performance as Buddy, an emotionally disturbed character whose most important reason for being in the film is to add to the list suspects.  Luckily, Raimi wove in enough of Buddy's story to give Ribisi an opportunity to strut his stuff, because his performance is one of the few things that elevate this film from mediocrity.  Ribisi throws himself into the part, ripping his heart out and shredding it right on screen (for all you horror addicts, that was a metaphor, not a literal description).  If Ribisi keeps belting out performances like this, he could well become another Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro, great actors who didn't fit the standard leading man mold, but made it on pure talent.Overall, this was a middling story with average acting, mundane direction and a standout performance by an up and coming actor in a supporting role.

To be honest I have no idea why I waited but now that I have learned of my errors I can move on to review it. This is one of those movies that even if you see the ending coming it still does not take anything away from the viewing experience. In fact I don't know anyone who did not second guess their first thoughts on who did it in this well paced thriller. Sure to some you may see the ending coming but the performances are so good that it is still a great experience.The movie follows Annie Wilson [Cate Blanchett] who is a fortune teller for lack of a better word; she leads a some what comfortable life rearing her kids and dealing with the death of their father. Of course with the customers she has she has to deal with a few nuts, and I am talking about the customers family members. Things are going fine until she meets a fella [Greg Kinnear] who has a promiscuous wife [Katie Holmes]; turns out she will have more to do with her and her husband in the future. Of course she also has to deal with the husband [Keanu Reeves] of one of her clients [Hilary Swank] who constantly is threatening her and her children. Then naturally if that is not enough there is the deeply in need of help client [Giovanni Ribisi] who by the way is the show stealer here. Throw all that together and you have one very entertaining movie from the great Sam Raimi.While some may be able to figure this one out it is still fun to watch it all play out, and I know you will not see the end coming. There is something in here that just comes from no where but makes perfect sense. Writers Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson did a great job with this film, the characters are interesting and the story is great. Of course director Sam Raimi keeps things moving at a nice pace and never stays to long on one thing. Also in going back to his horror roots there are plenty of scenes with genuine tension in them. Another wonderful thing about this film is the setting, I love that southern style and sound that is brought forth threw the film.Star Cate Blanchett does a great job in this movie as the so called ""witch"" that helps out the police in a murder investigation that she has more of a connection to then she knows. I believe her in this role and she makes this movie much better then films that are similar like ""The Skeleton Key"" which wasn't bad but it wasn't this. Also Katie Holmes is kinda devilish in this movie and she plays the part well, I always thought of her as a goody goody before this film. Hilary Swank is great in this as well as the abused and scared wife that does not know how to leave a husband that is no good for her. All three of these ladies did a great job in this film and deserve the credit for doing so.J.K Simmons who would go on later to play J.J. in the Spider-Man movies for Sam does a great job here as the local sheriff, as does Gary Cole as the prosecution attorney who would play the excellent ""Sheriff Buck"" in the Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert produced show ""American Gothic"" [one of the greatest shows of all time no doubt]. Greg Kinnear is great as the husband of the dead in this film, and Keanu Reeves surprised me with an excellent portrayal of an abusive husband and stalker. Still the scene stealer in this one by far is Giovanni Ribisi who is amazing as the truly disturbed Buddy Cole who seems to have issues with his father. Honestly it is one of the best performances I have seen; yes I truly enjoyed his performance in this film.This is not the best movie ever made but it is still one of the most enjoyable, I had a great time watching this the first time and a great one again recently. Sam Raimi did a great job with this film and had a wonderful cast to help him out as well. Go into this one ready to be entertained it is a nice mix of suspense and drama that I am sure all would enjoy.

It's a visually beautiful film. One of my favourite shots in the film is when Cate Blanchet has a vision of a dead Katie Holmes ""swimming"" in a tree. Sam Raimi also proves that he's still a pretty brilliant director when it comes to suspense. A lot of directors seems to think that everything needs to be completely dark for things to get scary. Raimi proves them wrong by having Blanchet turn on the light, which any reasonable person in real life would have done, when she enters her house suspecting there might be an intruder in there, and still he manages to create a fairly suspenseful moment. What's so sad about this film is that the plot is not very original. It's easy to figure out where things are going. You can early on tell who the killer is.

Cate Blanchett is her usual great actress self, entirely possessed and entirely in control of her little family, soon after her husband's death in a work-place accident.  Her daily life is a struggle on all fronts, and well worth watching.

The Gift features a fantastic ensemble who all put in very strong performances. Giovanni Ribisi does a great job (and finally finds a good role in a good film), Hilary Swank is perfect as poor white trash (in her first film since Boys Don't Cry), and even Keanu Reeves (who doesn't say 'woah' even once) puts in a strong performance.Sam Raimi, who stumbled a bit with his last (Kevin Costner micromanaged) film For Love of The Game, gets back closer to his roots with an engaging ghost story that is both entertaining and thrilling. The Gift is an important film for Raimi who finally finds the right blend of his dark vision and a brighter, more hopeful view of the world.

I seen her in films where I was nuts about her.  The result:  I think she's a top notch actor who really ""becomes"" her characters and its them that I like or dislike.  That said, her performance in The Gift is spot on!This is a spooky film about a psychic living in a small rural town in the South, who happens to get mixed up in a murder.  I don't remember this film hitting the big screen - I'm sorry I didn't see it there.  With acting credits that include: Keanu Reeves (never creepier); Greg Kinnear; J.K. Simmons; Giovanni Ribisi (odd as ever); and Hillary Swank, this film is not lacking in the performances.Cate Blanchett is a poor widowed mother of three cute boys, who just happens to truly have ""the gift"" of second sight.  She keeps herself just ahead of the bill collectors by doing ""tarot readings"" for residents of her small town (it is an interesting point to note that the cards she uses are NOT tarot cards - thus adding the element that she really must be a true psychic).  She ""sees"" the girlfriend of her eldest son's principal dead, but dismisses it.  Later when the girl is missing and later found dead, she gets caught up in the investigation.  There are those who do not believe in her and others who fear her powers.  Not satisfied with the single plot line there are two other interesting and poignant plotlines woven into this film.This film had a distinctly ""silver screen"" feel to it.  It was really quite good, but not in the way modern films are - on a higher level of films from the classic era.  If that is a concern for you, rest assured that there is gratuitous nudity, four letter words, and a few creepy scenes that you wouldn't find in an old black and white film.Critics didn't really like this film - and I truly believe it was because it really tells a story - it has a good script - and those are things modern critics do not like - they want a script made up of nothing more than four letter words strung together, lots of nudity, and a pointless script.  This film is none of those things - it is a really good film.Check it out, I think you will be very pleased.",4,Very spooky and moody southern gothic film,1022544000,"05 28, 2002",2002,2203,"['Cate', 'Blanchett', 'truly', 'enigma', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'seen', 'films', 'where', 'was', 'nuts', 'result', 'think', 'top', 'notch', 'actor', 'who', 'really', 'becomes', 'characters', 'like', 'dislike', 'said', 'performance', 'Gift', 'spot', 'spooky', 'film', 'psychic', 'living', 'small', 'rural', 'town', 'South', 'who', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'murder', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'film', 'hitting', 'big', 'screen', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'there', 'acting', 'credits', 'include', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'never', 'creepier', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'odd', 'ever', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'film', 'not', 'lacking', 'performances.Cate', 'Blanchett', 'poor', 'widowed', 'mother', 'three', 'cute', 'boys', 'who', 'just', 'truly', 'have', 'gift', 'second', 'sight', 'just', 'ahead', 'bill', 'collectors', 'doing', 'tarot', 'readings', 'residents', 'small', 'town', 'interesting', 'point', 'note', 'cards', 'uses', 'are', 'NOT', 'cards', 'thus', 'adding', 'element', 'really', 'must', 'be', 'true', 'psychic', 'sees', 'girlfriend', 'eldest', 'son', 'principal', 'dead', 'Later', 'when', 'girl', 'missing', 'later', 'found', 'dead', 'caught', 'up', 'investigation', 'are', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'others', 'who', 'fear', 'powers', 'Not', 'satisfied', 'single', 'plot', 'line', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'interesting', 'poignant', 'plotlines', 'woven', 'film.This', 'film', 'had', 'distinctly', 'silver', 'screen', 'feel', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'way', 'modern', 'films', 'are', 'higher', 'level', 'films', 'classic', 'era', 'concern', 'rest', 'assured', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'few', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'film.Critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'film', 'truly', 'believe', 'was', 'really', 'story', 'good', 'script', 'are', 'things', 'modern', 'critics', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'script', 'made', 'nothing', 'more', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'strung', 'together', 'lots', 'nudity', 'pointless', 'script', 'film', 'none', 'things', 'really', 'good', 'film.Check', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'pleased']",N/A

Katie Holmes plays elementary school principal Greg Kinnear's slutty little belle fianc&eacute;e, Hilary Swank is great as Keanu's battered wife, and Giovanni Ribisi once again gives his all in a remarkably powerful little role as a slightly schizo mechanic. Ribisi's performance recalls that of James Dean in ""Giant"" as he mumbles his way through his conversations with Blanchett, whom he is clearly fond of.

It DIDN'T have Cate Blanchett in it.""Of course, Cate only seems ubiquitous, and because she has an almost creepy Streepian ability for accents, she CAN pretty much play any role that comes her way.  (I haven't seen her as Bob Dylan yet, but I'm sure she pulls it off with aplomb.)Blanchett heads what was a pretty stellar cast. Hilary Swank, Katie Holmes, Greg Kinnear, Keanu Reeves and Giovanni Ribisi were all on board.  And while maybe most of these actors were more in the ""up and comers"" category in 2000 than the established names they pretty much are today, it is the kind of casting that catches the eye or any reasonably serious movie lover.  You figure a cast this strong (and did I forget Rosemary Harris in a mere wisp of a role) has to have a script, and direction to match.Well, you wouldn't be entirely wrong in that assumption.  On the other hand, you wouldn't be quite right either.  The plot is somewhat predictable and the Southern Gothic is pretty much laid on with a trowel.Like many films concerning psychic phenomena, the old ""blessing and a curse"" sentiment is always right below the surface.  What's interesting in these films, however, is implicit acknowledgement that if such gifts do exist, they have their limitations, often profound limitations.Director Sam Raimi works wonders with his cast.  Even a critical whipping boy like Keanu Reeves comes off very well--in what's a pretty thankless role, after all.  Greg Kinnear and Katie Holmes--both really still establishing their reputations as actors--come off very well together AND separately.  Some have accused Giovanni Ribisi of hamming it up in this one, but he really does no more than the script requires of him. But sepaking of the script (by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson) were a little sharper and more original.

I mean, these people know what the heck they are doing in every scene. How refreshing.Cate Blanchett plays a small town southern widow who possesses the ""Gift"" of second sight, and she picks up money to support her kids by reading cards for the locals. Because, due to this,  she is intimate with so many people in town, and because she apparently was blessed with a giving nature and natural  kindness, she becomes embroiled in a messy set of life problems: wife abuse (Keanu Reeeves looking sinister in a beard, and Hilary Swank looking like a sort of anorexic Erin Brockovich-type character), mental disintegration (Giovanni Rubisi in a kickbutt performace--keep your eye on him--he is awesome), and finally, a nasty murder case involving the town slut.Some of the shooting and the dream sequence scenes are really quite scary, and I think the direction by Sam Raimi had a lot to do with the quality of this film, which could have gone under with nothing to offer, but...oooo that cast.

And sadly, what we have here is a reiteration of that fact. Kudos to Cate Blanchet for her relatively good performance of a relatively weak character, and even Keanu Reeves is to be credited for his loathsome portrayal of a not so likeable racist redneck (Just one more reason to hate him I suppose.) Though the bench is deep with talent, in the end it is poor writing that snatches defeat from the jaws of victory (if I may deign to use that tired fraise). They try to dazzle us with plot twists; despite that the plot is so thin and emaciated, one might not even notice it was there at all. There are so many sub-plots eluded to, that there is no time to explore any of them, and the kind of subtlety employed to suggest these segue's was either badly edited, or more likely bungled. There also seems to be a lot of dead useless space in this film. Not the kind that clever directors use to try to build some kind of dynamic tension, just dead useless space. I guess the final nail in this coffin was the superfluous use of white trash, and white trash motifs. A lot of dead horse flogging in this film when there really didn't need to be, and it's saving grace I suppose is the fact that you won't see Wesley Snipes getting ""set up"" in it (probably because he's not in it). Those of you who have heard that Katie Holmes gets in the buff, well, it's really not worth it, and you will be left with a profound understanding of how Wesley Snipes feels every time he gets ""set up"".",2,"Utterly forgettable, and mediocre.

The plot is absolutely forseeable, even the slightest twist in the story is something that does not surprise you but just prove your expectations. The soutern accents and dialogues were fun to listen to and the movie was creepy at times - although the frights provided by the film were rather cheap, because they were primarily forseeable, as I already mentioned, and second, they were not subtle as an other reviewer put it, but the exact contrary: the visions of blanchett were just quick cuts showing violence, or, if you want it more detailed, a pretty funny looking Katie Holmes zombie supposed to be her corpse, appearing with a sudden impact of short violence scenes that should scare you, but really did not - to me, this is not subtle, but the work of a film student desperately trying to gain some suspense.The movie is not that bad, I liked it, but there were several things that make it sloppy and less enjoyable like listed above. The actors did great, I won't argue on that won, but the storyline these actors are pursuing is just bad work. The story is not very original, so I can't really understand the wages of praise this movie receives. It is in fact an alright movie, see it once, never watch it again, or maybe a second time with friends, skipping most of the film because you go to the kitchen to get some coca cola or pop corn every now and then. to all of you, who don't only watch a movie because you like the main actors (e.g., The Lord Of The Rings is not that much about the actors, I guess, not for me at least), this movie's story is low. It is an average flick backed up a little by good actors. I'd suggest you rent this movie - I did - view it once and bring it back.

583630,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B00005JH9M,Kathy W,"[1, 2]","A thoroughly enjoyable and suspenseful story with an outstanding cast of mighty fine actors, this movie is laced with a few twists and turns.  It begins in the South, around the swamplands in Alabama, I believe.  Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchette) is a widow with 3 boys to raise.  Her husband died about a year ago.  She gets a small Social Security check and supplements it with donations she receives for giving (psychic) card readings for the local people.  Valerie Barksdale (Hilary Swank) is one of her fairly frequent customers.  Valerie's husband Donnie Barksdale (Keanu Reeves) is very physically and verbally abusive to Valerie.  We are talking black eyes, dragging by the hair, etc.  Donnie is also a serious redneck.  Valerie is always sneaking off to see Annie and asking Annie what to do.  Then Donnie gets mad at Valerie for going to see Annie.  Donnie also gets mad because Annie tells Valerie to leave Donnie.  He tells Annie to ""STAY AWAY FROM MY WIFE!"" and starts threatening Annie and her boys, but, I'm jumping a tad ahead of myself.Annie is called to school because one of her boys was fighting.  He is still very angry over his father's death.  The teacher is the fine actor Greg Kinnear (Wayne)(the gay guy in ""As Good As It Gets"").  I LOVE him.  He is always such a great asset to any movie. Wayne is an easy-tempered school teacher.  Wayne's fiancee, Jessica, is a bit free-spirited with the men in town.  Of course, she sneaks off for her little escapades when Wayne is not looking.Back to Annie--Annie is low on money and she has a friend ""Buddy"" in town.  Buddy is the local mechanic and all his pistons are not firing properly.  I mean, Buddy has some real serious issues, stemming from childhood abuse by his daddy. Annie just tries to be his friend and help him out.  To say that Buddy has demons in his head, figuratively, is somewhat of an understatement. Buddy is always seeking advice from Annie cause he is seriously messed up, and you find out why later in the movie.  Anyway, Buddy keeps Annie's car running for her and lets her pay later, which really helps Annie out.Now, Annie is a psychic who see glimpses of the past and the future.  She also is a medium.  She sees people occassionally from ""the other side"".  While she is outside, Granny stops by (deceased) and tells Annie ""A storm is coming.""  Annie sees a bloddy vision.  Granny tells Annie, ""Always use your instincts, Annie"".Later, Annie is at a party and accidentally opens a door and sees Jessica getting it on with some guy at a party, but Jessica is preoccupied and doesn't see Annie.  When Annie returns home after the party, it is obvious that someone has been in her house.  She finds her TV on, bedroom window open, and her reading cards laid out on the bed to spell ""SATAN"".  Now, good-ole-boy Donnie was calling her ""witch"" and making related comments when he was threatening her before, so she figures it was Donnie.  She tells the police but, since the cop and Donnie are squirrel-hunting buddies, the cop says it couldn't be Donnie. Things heat up as Donnie continues to threaten Annie, as Buddy keeps talking about ""the blue diamond"" and how he hates his daddy, as Jessica keeps ho-ing around, and as Annie keeps reading her cards for people.  Annie dreams/visions of being choked.  Jessica disappears.  Donnie threatens one of Annie's boys on the road and tells him his momma is a witch and somebody might kill her.  After Jessica disappears, Annie starts seeing visions of her being dead and she keeps waking up at 1:30 am.Like I said, twists and turns--I found it very good.  I could not walk away for even a minute without hitting the pause button.  Gary Cole also plays a prosecutor.  The movie is about 2 hours long.  I loved it and even though I know what happens, I will still watch it again.

She plays a woman who is struggling to make ends meet after the death of her husband, trying to raise 3 young boys on Social Security and what extra bit of money she makes as a psychic reader. When a young woman turns up dead, she is called on to help solve the murder. She reluctantly takes on the task. Here's where the movie breaks down, as Blanchett allows herself to be put in all sorts of dangerous situations with potential killers. But like I say, you may find yourself enjoying the movie anyway, as it has a strong cast (inlcluding Keeanu Reeves as an abusive husband to poor Hillary Swank, Greg Kinnear as a jilted lover and more), great atmosphere and plenty more going for it.",4,A touch of film noir and plenty of style,996019200,"07 25, 2001",2001,1234,"['When', 'atmosphere', 'hints', 'film', 'noir', 'style', 'burn', 'one', 'spades', 'Unfortunately', 'mystery', 'heart', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'strong', 'husband', 'knew', 'who', 'killer', 'was', 'early', 'Even', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'one', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'had', 'going', 'anyway', 'songs', 'music', 'were', 'perfectly', 'designed', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'max', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'made', 'very', 'charismatic', 'psychic', 'compassionate', 'insightful', 'wise', 'enough', 'know', 'what', 'reveal', 'what', 'hold', 'back', 'woman', 'who', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'death', 'husband', 'trying', 'raise', '3', 'young', 'boys', 'Social', 'Security', 'what', 'extra', 'bit', 'money', 'psychic', 'reader', 'When', 'young', 'woman', 'up', 'dead', 'called', 'help', 'solve', 'murder', 'reluctantly', 'task', 'Here', 'where', 'movie', 'down', 'Blanchett', 'be', 'put', 'sorts', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'potential', 'killers', 'say', 'may', 'find', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'anyway', 'strong', 'cast', 'inlcluding', 'Keeanu', 'Reeves', 'abusive', 'husband', 'poor', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'jilted', 'lover', 'more', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'plenty', 'more', 'going']",N/A

That's hard for me to understand, because not only does it have a brilliant cast, it's a great story that holds on to you and keeps you enthralled for the entire time.  It stars Cate Blanchett, Giovanni Ribisi, Greg Kinnear and Katie Holmes.  It also stars Keanu Reeves in what I consider to be his best performance as a wife-beating slackjaw who constantly hurts his wife(played with trailer trash charm by Hilary Swank).  There's also a brief but very intense cameo by Dennis Hopper.The basic plot is this:  A murder has occurred in Blanchett's sleepy little town.  No one knows who committed it and leads are slim.  In desperation, the local authorities seek out Blanchett's psychic abilities to look for clues.  What ensues is a haunting tale of good ol' fashion spooks, creepy sequences, and a wonderful little mystery that keeps a grip on you.Written by Billy Bob Thornton, who has a knack for capturing the good folks of the South, and Tom Epperson.  Sam Raimi directs this flick and though it is nothing like his ""Evil Dead"" films or even his ""Spiderman"" flicks, you can see bits and pieces of Raimi's brilliant and off-kilter humor throughout this film.A must see for fans of a good murder mystery, suspenseful horror, or Raimi fanatics.

Looney,"[36, 37]","With a story and setting that could lead a director and cast down the well-travelled road of Southern Gothic cliches, THE GIFT instead rewards the viewer with intelligence, suspenseful and effective direction, and some superb acting by a very talented ensemble.  Bily Bob Thornton had a hand in writing the screenplay, so the quality there should come as no surprise.  The plot twists are expected as well, but they are done with such care and expertise that the audience is never really sure where they are leading.Cate Blanchett stars as Annie Wilson, a young widow with three sons to raise -- her husband was killed a year before the story in a work-related accident.  She and the boys survive on a social security check each month -- to further make ends meet, she gives 'readings' to various members of the small Georgia community of Brixton, calling her talent a 'gift'.  She accepts donations, but doesn't set prices -- she doesn't come across as a sideshow fortune teller here.  She doesn't have the power to read minds -- or, in a courtroom scene, to tell an attorney how many fingers he's holding up behind his back -- and she never makes any claims in that area.  Her gift comes to her in the form of visions or dreams -- sometimes they occur when she's giving a reading, sometimes they come unexpectedly.One of her clients is a battered wife (Hilary Swank) of a angry, ignorant redneck (played with frightening reality by Keanu Reeves) -- she advises the woman to leave her husband before he puts her in the hospital, advice that sends him to her home to threaten her and her children when he learns of it.  Another of her clients, an extremely troubled man named Buddy, is given an outstanding portrayal by Giovanni Ribisi -- the character is seething with (believable) inner torment, which, as the story progresses, we see to be long-buried anger toward his father.  Ribisi infuses his character with an incredible level of emotion and vulnerability.  Greg Kinnear plays Wayne, the handsome school principal engaged to a beautiful but fairly trampy daughter of a successful local businessman.  When this woman turns up missing and local law enforcement runs out of leads, the skeptical sheriff reluctantly turns to Annie for help.  Through a series of visions, she aids them in finding the body, the violent redneck is arrested and put on trial...and then the twists begin.  From here, you're on your own...NO SPOILERS!  Suffice to say that the twists and turns don't always lead where you think they will.Aside from the well-written story, the skillful direction, and the superb acting in this film, the thing that jumped out at me was noticing how many of these characters were in deep denial of their own primal pain.  In one scene, one of Annie's sons asks her at bedtime why they don't go more often to visit their father's grave, why they don't talk about him.  She replies by telling him to go to bed, that she wants to read.  In doing this, her character is, in effect, telling this child (perhaps not intentionally) that his feelings don't matter -- but at the same time, she's denying her own pain, perhaps stemming from her husband's death.  Hilary Swank's battered wife character is in denial that she doesn't deserve to live as a punching bag, that there might be a better way to go through her life.  Keanu Reeves redneck Donnie is in denial of his own violent, woman-hating, hungry-for-control nature.  The high school principal is blind to the fact that his wife-to-be is a trollop who neither loves nor respects him.  And most touchingly, we see Giovanni Ribisi take his character through some very moving realizations about his own childhood and his relationship with his father.The film is very dark and suspenseful -- and at times very jarring in its imagery and violence, but these moments are brief.  It's certainly not exploitive in this regard.  It's extremely entertaining -- I don't think most viewers would lose interest as it moves along -- but mostly it's very revealing about the way we humans deal with the primal pain that we all hold within us.  Ribisi's character describes it very accurately as a wall in his head that he can't get past -- until we face whatever it iis that iis causing us pain, and deal with it as it stands, we won't get past it, and it will continue to torment us and, in some cases, rule over us.  We each have to realize that we need to feel the hurt in order to begin to heal -- not a very attractive prospect, perhaps, but a realistic one.This outstanding film shines a bright light on this aspect of the human psyche -- it's something from which we could all benefit in viewing more closely.  Audiences may have been uncomfortable with this film in theatres because of this aspect -- and they may not have realized why.",5,THERE ARE GIFTS WITHIN 'THE GIFT'...,995932800,"07 24, 2001",2001,4793,"['story', 'setting', 'could', 'lead', 'director', 'cast', 'well-travelled', 'road', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'cliches', 'THE', 'GIFT', 'instead', 'viewer', 'intelligence', 'suspenseful', 'effective', 'direction', 'superb', 'acting', 'very', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'Bily', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'had', 'hand', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'quality', 'there', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'expected', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'done', 'such', 'care', 'expertise', 'audience', 'never', 'really', 'sure', 'where', 'are', 'leading.Cate', 'Blanchett', 'stars', 'Annie', 'Wilson', 'young', 'widow', 'three', 'sons', 'raise', 'husband', 'was', 'killed', 'year', 'story', 'work-related', 'accident', 'boys', 'survive', 'social', 'security', 'check', 'month', 'further', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', ""'readings"", 'various', 'members', 'small', 'Georgia', 'community', 'Brixton', 'calling', 'talent', ""'gift"", 'donations', ""n't"", 'set', 'prices', ""n't"", 'come', 'sideshow', 'fortune', 'teller', 'here', ""n't"", 'have', 'power', 'read', 'minds', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'tell', 'attorney', 'how', 'many', 'fingers', 'holding', 'up', 'back', 'never', 'claims', 'area', 'gift', 'form', 'visions', 'dreams', 'sometimes', 'occur', 'when', 'giving', 'reading', 'sometimes', 'come', 'unexpectedly.One', 'clients', 'battered', 'wife', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'angry', 'ignorant', 'redneck', 'played', 'frightening', 'reality', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'woman', 'leave', 'husband', 'hospital', 'advice', 'home', 'threaten', 'children', 'when', 'clients', 'extremely', 'troubled', 'man', 'named', 'Buddy', 'given', 'outstanding', 'portrayal', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'character', 'seething', 'believable', 'inner', 'torment', 'story', 'see', 'be', 'long-buried', 'anger', 'father', 'Ribisi', 'character', 'incredible', 'level', 'emotion', 'vulnerability', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Wayne', 'handsome', 'school', 'principal', 'engaged', 'beautiful', 'fairly', 'trampy', 'daughter', 'successful', 'local', 'businessman', 'When', 'woman', 'up', 'missing', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'leads', 'skeptical', 'sheriff', 'reluctantly', 'Annie', 'help', 'series', 'visions', 'finding', 'body', 'violent', 'redneck', 'arrested', 'put', 'trial', 'then', 'twists', 'begin', 'here', ""'re"", 'own', 'NO', 'SPOILERS', 'Suffice', 'say', 'twists', 'turns', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'lead', 'where', 'think', 'will.Aside', 'well-written', 'story', 'skillful', 'direction', 'superb', 'acting', 'film', 'thing', 'jumped', 'out', 'was', 'noticing', 'how', 'many', 'characters', 'were', 'deep', 'denial', 'own', 'primal', 'pain', 'one', 'scene', 'one', 'Annie', 'sons', 'bedtime', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'more', 'often', 'visit', 'father', 'grave', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'telling', 'go', 'bed', 'read', 'doing', 'character', 'effect', 'telling', 'child', 'perhaps', 'not', 'intentionally', 'feelings', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'same', 'time', 'denying', 'own', 'pain', 'perhaps', 'stemming', 'husband', 'death', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'battered', 'wife', 'character', 'denial', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'live', 'punching', 'bag', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'way', 'go', 'life', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'redneck', 'Donnie', 'denial', 'own', 'violent', 'woman-hating', 'hungry-for-control', 'nature', 'high', 'school', 'principal', 'fact', 'wife-to-be', 'trollop', 'who', 'loves', 'most', 'touchingly', 'see', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'take', 'character', 'very', 'moving', 'realizations', 'own', 'childhood', 'relationship', 'father.The', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'suspenseful', 'times', 'very', 'jarring', 'imagery', 'violence', 'moments', 'are', 'brief', 'certainly', 'not', 'exploitive', 'regard', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'lose', 'interest', 'along', 'mostly', 'very', 'revealing', 'way', 'humans', 'deal', 'primal', 'pain', 'hold', 'Ribisi', 'character', 'very', 'accurately', 'wall', 'head', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'face', 'iis', 'causing', 'pain', 'deal', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'will', 'continue', 'torment', 'cases', 'rule', 'have', 'realize', 'need', 'feel', 'hurt', 'order', 'begin', 'heal', 'not', 'very', 'attractive', 'prospect', 'perhaps', 'realistic', 'one.This', 'outstanding', 'film', 'bright', 'light', 'aspect', 'human', 'psyche', 'something', 'could', 'benefit', 'viewing', 'more', 'closely', 'Audiences', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'uncomfortable', 'film', 'theatres', 'aspect', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'realized', 'why']",N/A

Keanu Reeves also does a star turn, as Hilary Swank's abusive and philandering husband. Cate Blanchett is excellent as the young, impoverished widow with kids, who just happens to have psychic gifts. The always underrated Greg Kinnear gives his usual excellent performance.The action takes place in a rural Georgia town, where Cate reads cards for clients in an attempt to make ends meet. Hilary Swank is one of Cate's clients. Cate counsels her to leave her abusive and womanizing husband, played by Keanu Reeves. This just earns Cate the emnity of Keanu, who begins a campaign of terror against her. Cate also reads cards for Giovanni Ribisi, who is a standout with his dazzling performance in the role of a mentally traumatized young man, whom Cate treats kindly.Cate is called to her son's school one day, where she meets with Greg Kinnear over something her son did. While there, she meets  meets his kittenish fiancee, well played by Katie Holmes, who recognizes Cate as the local psychic and asks what she sees in their future. What Cate sees does not bode well for them.When Kinnear's fiancee predictably turns up murdered, the hunt is on for her killer. The obvious suspect is Keanu Reeves, who is tried and convicted for the murder, after Cate testifies at his trial. You see, the body was found in a pond on his property, after Cate had a vision about it, and Keanu had been having an affair with her and had been the last person known to have seen the deceased alive.After the trial, however, Cate has visions that lead her to believe that the real killer has escaped justice. While there are a number of red herrings that are thrown the viewer's way, the viewer should have no trouble zeroing in on the real killer. What is surprising is the way Cate escapes death at the hands of that killer. Therein lies the real surprise.

It has great indoor sets, and builds suspense well.  There were some really scary moments.  It is on par with a Lifetime movie, and not a bad way to kill an afternoon.  Plus, how can you resist a cast featuring Cate Blanchett, Keanu Reeves, Hilary Swank, Katie Holmes, Greg Kinnear, and Giovanni Ribisi?Cate Blanchett stars as small town psychic Annie Wilson, raising three boys as a widow.  She brings in extra money by doing card readings to people in need of serious mental and sometimes physical medical care.  Here come the one-dimensional characters.  This plot and group is so stereotyped and overdone that it would serve well as a Whodunit audience participatory dinner theatre murder mystery. Hilary Swank is the Abused Wife.  Reeves is The Wife Beater, a bully so unbelievable he also threatens little boys.  Ribisi is the crazy schizoprenic.  Holmes is The Slutty Society girl.  I would say how slutty she is, but it would spoil the story.The makeup is also really bad in this movie. Swank sports a shiner that screams ""shoe polish,"" and is gone without a trace next time we see her.  And when Holmes' dead body is shown, she looks like a ghost in a Gothic thriller rather than a dead body.  She also looks like she is playing dead.  Last, but not least, gratuitous nudity to push this up to an 'R' rating.Enjoy this Lifetime type film, but don't expect more than dinner theatre.",3,Can I Return This 'Gift?',1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,1718,"['Gift', 'stunning', 'heavyweight', 'cast', 'actors', 'screenplay', 'co-written', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'time', 'was', 'disappointed', 'predictable', 'plot', 'cliched', 'screenplay', 'one-dimensional', 'characters.The', 'Gift', 'few', 'things', 'going', 'great', 'indoor', 'sets', 'builds', 'suspense', 'well', 'were', 'really', 'scary', 'moments', 'par', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'kill', 'afternoon', 'how', 'can', 'resist', 'cast', 'featuring', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'small', 'town', 'psychic', 'Annie', 'Wilson', 'raising', 'three', 'boys', 'widow', 'extra', 'money', 'doing', 'card', 'readings', 'people', 'need', 'serious', 'mental', 'sometimes', 'physical', 'medical', 'care', 'Here', 'come', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'plot', 'group', 'so', 'stereotyped', 'overdone', 'would', 'serve', 'well', 'Whodunit', 'audience', 'participatory', 'dinner', 'theatre', 'murder', 'mystery', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Abused', 'Wife', 'Reeves', 'Wife', 'Beater', 'bully', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'also', 'little', 'boys', 'Ribisi', 'crazy', 'schizoprenic', 'Holmes', 'Slutty', 'Society', 'girl', 'would', 'say', 'how', 'slutty', 'would', 'spoil', 'story.The', 'makeup', 'also', 'really', 'bad', 'movie', 'Swank', 'sports', 'shiner', 'shoe', 'polish', 'gone', 'trace', 'next', 'time', 'see', 'when', 'Holmes', 'dead', 'body', 'shown', 'ghost', 'Gothic', 'thriller', 'rather', 'dead', 'body', 'also', 'playing', 'dead', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'push', 'up', 'R', 'rating.Enjoy', 'Lifetime', 'type', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'more', 'dinner', 'theatre']",N/A
583643,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B00005JH9M,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[2, 3]","in a relatively simple tale of crime in rural Georgia, writer Billy Bob Thornton, and director Sam Raimi give the viewer a suspense filled murder mystery that hasn't had enough play in theaters or the rental market.  Raimi sticks to the formula of evil in the cracker south that has worked so well for him in prior flicks - his casting is excellent!Giovanni Ribisi (who has not failed to be brilliant in any of his roles -- please don't count Mod Squad!) is phenomenal in a supporting role as a garage mechanic on the edge of madness.  Ribisi can convey insanity better with just his facial expressions than most actors on the screen today.  The only positive influence in his life is small-town psychic Annie (Blanchett), a widow with 3 children who treats her psychic gifts as a legacy, and stays true to them, even when confronted by constabulary scorn.  Ribisi's scene with his father is truly shocking.Blanchett carries the lead role well, and is believable both as a mom and as a woman who cannot escape from her premonitions about the murder of the town's richest girl, Jessica (played by Katie Holmes).  Greg Kinnear, as Jessica's fiance and the school principal, once again contributes the quiet everyman performance that makes him a natural supporting actor.In a related story of domestic abuse, Keanu Reeves and Hilary Swank are cast as a couple who place Annie directly in the middle of their tumultuous marriage.  Swank is believable, but just so, Reeves was miscast and particularly so, when you learn of his romantic involvement with Holmes.  Had this role gone to Robert Downey Jr. or Kevin Bacon, the film would have increased its believability and marketability.  Not sure who wants to pay to see Keanu in a dramatic role.Although you will be able to figure out the eventual discovery of the murderer's identity, you will be engrossed in getting there in both characterization and scenery....A win for Sam Raimi.",4,&quot;The Gift&quot; will surprise you....,1011484800,"01 20, 2002",2002,1930,"['relatively', 'simple', 'tale', 'crime', 'rural', 'Georgia', 'writer', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'give', 'viewer', 'suspense', 'filled', 'murder', 'mystery', ""n't"", 'had', 'enough', 'play', 'theaters', 'rental', 'market', 'Raimi', 'sticks', 'formula', 'evil', 'cracker', 'south', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'prior', 'flicks', 'casting', 'excellent', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'who', 'not', 'failed', 'be', 'brilliant', 'roles', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'phenomenal', 'supporting', 'role', 'garage', 'mechanic', 'edge', 'madness', 'Ribisi', 'can', 'convey', 'insanity', 'better', 'just', 'facial', 'expressions', 'most', 'actors', 'screen', 'today', 'only', 'positive', 'influence', 'life', 'small-town', 'psychic', 'Annie', 'Blanchett', 'widow', '3', 'children', 'who', 'psychic', 'gifts', 'legacy', 'true', 'even', 'when', 'confronted', 'constabulary', 'scorn', 'Ribisi', 'scene', 'father', 'truly', 'shocking.Blanchett', 'lead', 'role', 'well', 'believable', 'mom', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'premonitions', 'murder', 'town', 'richest', 'girl', 'Jessica', 'played', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Jessica', 'fiance', 'school', 'principal', 'once', 'again', 'quiet', 'everyman', 'performance', 'natural', 'supporting', 'actor.In', 'related', 'story', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'are', 'cast', 'couple', 'who', 'place', 'Annie', 'directly', 'middle', 'tumultuous', 'marriage', 'Swank', 'believable', 'just', 'so', 'Reeves', 'was', 'miscast', 'particularly', 'so', 'when', 'learn', 'romantic', 'involvement', 'Holmes', 'Had', 'role', 'gone', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'increased', 'believability', 'marketability', 'Not', 'sure', 'who', 'pay', 'see', 'Keanu', 'dramatic', 'role.Although', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'eventual', 'discovery', 'murderer', 'identity', 'will', 'be', 'engrossed', 'getting', 'there', 'characterization', 'scenery', 'win', 'Sam', 'Raimi']",N/A

Unfortunately, she's about all there is to recommend this disappointing 'psychic thriller' which struggles along for almost two hours with a bunch of Southern Gothic cliches that have been cobbled together.  Maybe Billy Bob had some great ideas that got compromised in the studio development process by a couple of Prada-clad Gen X  D-girls, and it all fell apart. Who can tell? What is certain is that this ain't no &quot;Don't Look Now&quot;, a film against which all psychic thrillers must be measured; it ain't even &quot;Wise Blood&quot;. And it certainly ain't &quot;Sling Blade.&quot;It's pleasant enough and engaging at turns until the final reel, when all the plot contrivances start banging into each other like  derailed train cars.  Ka-noo actually delivers a good performance, or a performance, one must qualify, but the portrayal of Southerners is shallow Hollywood-phoned-in cliche as usual - except for Cate Blanchett, of course, who brings great dimension to anything she takes on (check her touching 'socialite' role out in 1999's &quot;Ripley&quot;).THE GIFT had much promise, but like last year's DISMAL &quot;Unbreakable&quot; (Unbearable!), the metaphysics got compromised by the marketers, and D-girls and boys (burp) it seems, in order to get that market share, and the final product reflects little more than contrivance and confusion.  Granted, everything else out there is so awful that it stands as acceptable in comparison.Billy Bob Thornton's ALL THE PRETTY HORSES was tender and restrained; he is a fine director, and Sam Raimi holding the reins here is no slouch.

I sat snuggled up on the couch, a thunderstorm raging outside, while inside, the murky backwaters of the film's setting was eerily creeping me out. What is *most* impressive, is the fact that the movie really *should* be easy to figure out, and even the twist they throw in at the end should have been suspected beforehand, but I was totally drawn-in by the suspenseful direction, better-than-average acting, and the forebeddding setting.Cate Blanchett gives a tour-de-force performance as Annie Wilson, a recently widowed mother of three living in a small town in the woody, swampy area of Georgia. To help make ends meet, she uses a natural 'gift', that of reading cards and seeing images, and has built up quite a healthy practice using her powers. The central plot of the movie centers around her ability to &quot;see&quot; the events surrounding the murder of a local vixen.'The Gift', when stripped to bare bones, is a rather run-of-the-mill murder mystery, with some psychic themes thrown in. Billy Bob Thornton co-wrote a sturdy script, but it is somewhat similar to movies which have gone before. What is so *good* about *this* particular movie, however, is the way in which the actors and the director (Sam Raimi) built this piece into such a suspenseful, well-done movie.The cast includes Hilary Swank, Greg Kinnear, Giovanni Ribisi, and Keanu Reeves, *all* used to great effectiveness (yes, even Keanu Reeves). They take stock characters and breath believable life into them. Sam Raimi uses his directorial skill and takes certain scenes which, if handled a particular way, wouldn't be suspenseful, and makes them positively chilling. You almost have a sense of dread during parts of the film, all because of tone, setting, and cinematography. With locations used such as foreboding backyard swamps, dark trees with ghostly images floating in them, and a long pier with fog swirling around it, one can definitely feel the hairs on the back of their neck prickle.Watch 'The Gift' if you're in the mood for an eerie little mystery with a supernatural spin. But be sure to first draw the curtains, curl up on the couch, and have a suitable blanket to hide behind at times.

583650,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JH9M,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","The Gift was made by a group of people who themselves are extraordinarily gifted. Director Sam Raimi and co-writer Tom Epperson have been honored at many sci-fi film festivals. Its other writer, Billy Bob Thornton has won an Oscar and been nominated for two others. Hilary Swank won a Best Actress Oscar for Boys Don't Cry, while nominations have gone to Cate Blanchett for Elizabeth and to Greg Kinnear for As Good as it Gets. Giovanni Rabisi, one of the hottest young actors around, has won awards for his TV work. Keanu Reeves may never be Oscar material, but he has received a number of Blockbuster Awards, while Katie Holmes has been honored at the MTV Awards. Collectively, these people have been involved in some of the most memorable movies of the last ten years. And that may explain the problem that lies at the heart of The Gift. Had this movie been made by relative unknowns, it might have been hailed as a cult classic. As it is, it is overwhelmed by all that talent.Cate Blanchett plays Annie, a small town girl doing what she can to raise two young sons after the tragic and sudden death of her husband. She has what her grandmother called 'the gift'. She's a psychic, and to augment her income, she does card readings for many of the locals. She also fills her sessions with common sense advice. For example, she tells Valerie [Swank] to leave her abusive, redneck husband, Donnie [Reeves]. She advises Buddy [Ribisi], the local psycho, to face his demons by finding the source of his formidable anger. Annie always wants the best for everyone around her.One day she is called to her son's grammar school because he has been in a fight. While talking to Wayne [Kinnear], the principal, she meets Jessica [Holmes], Wayne's fiance. Suddenly, she has a horrible vision about Jessica, which she keeps to herself. When the girl goes missing, the local police chief, dubious but without any leads, goes to Annie to ask her to use her gift to find Jessica. Things soon go from bad to worse, not only for Wayne and Jessica, but also for Annie and most of the rest of the characters. Annie finds herself in serious trouble, and her gift turns out to be both a serious liability and the only thing that can save her.The Gift is a salute to Southern Gothic and contains every stock character found in that genre. It was filmed on location around Savannah, GA, which explains why it is so beautiful to look at.Needless to say, this cast does an impeccable job. Every character is quite believable. The dialog written by Thornton and Epperson rings true, and Raimi's direction is steady and assured. The problem is that the material is that of a 'B' picture and is hardly worth the concerted efforts of all this 'A-list' talent. What its producers need to learn is that, when you assemble this many powerhouses both in front of and behind the camera, people's expectations are going to be through the roof. So, while The Gift is a neat little psychological thriller, it can't help but disappoint.",3,'A' list talent shines in 'B' moive,1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,2999,"['Gift', 'was', 'made', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'extraordinarily', 'gifted', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'co-writer', 'Tom', 'Epperson', 'have', 'been', 'honored', 'many', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'festivals', 'other', 'writer', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'won', 'Oscar', 'been', 'nominated', 'two', 'others', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'nominations', 'have', 'gone', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Elizabeth', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'As', 'Good', 'Giovanni', 'Rabisi', 'one', 'hottest', 'young', 'actors', 'won', 'awards', 'TV', 'work', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'Oscar', 'material', 'received', 'number', 'Blockbuster', 'Awards', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'been', 'honored', 'MTV', 'Awards', 'Collectively', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'most', 'memorable', 'movies', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'may', 'explain', 'problem', 'heart', 'Gift', 'Had', 'movie', 'been', 'made', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'hailed', 'cult', 'classic', 'overwhelmed', 'talent.Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Annie', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'doing', 'what', 'can', 'raise', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'tragic', 'sudden', 'death', 'husband', 'what', 'grandmother', 'called', ""'the"", 'gift', 'psychic', 'augment', 'income', 'card', 'readings', 'many', 'locals', 'also', 'sessions', 'common', 'sense', 'advice', 'example', 'Valerie', '[', 'Swank', ']', 'leave', 'abusive', 'redneck', 'husband', 'Donnie', '[', 'Reeves', ']', 'Buddy', '[', 'Ribisi', ']', 'local', 'psycho', 'face', 'demons', 'finding', 'source', 'formidable', 'anger', 'Annie', 'always', 'best', 'everyone', 'her.One', 'day', 'called', 'son', 'grammar', 'school', 'been', 'fight', 'talking', 'Wayne', '[', 'Kinnear', ']', 'principal', 'Jessica', '[', 'Holmes', ']', 'Wayne', 'fiance', 'Suddenly', 'horrible', 'vision', 'Jessica', 'herself', 'When', 'girl', 'missing', 'local', 'police', 'chief', 'dubious', 'leads', 'Annie', 'ask', 'use', 'gift', 'find', 'Jessica', 'Things', 'soon', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'not', 'only', 'Wayne', 'Jessica', 'also', 'Annie', 'most', 'rest', 'characters', 'Annie', 'serious', 'trouble', 'gift', 'out', 'be', 'serious', 'liability', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'save', 'her.The', 'Gift', 'salute', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'stock', 'character', 'found', 'genre', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Savannah', 'GA', 'why', 'so', 'beautiful', 'look', 'at.Needless', 'say', 'cast', 'impeccable', 'job', 'character', 'quite', 'believable', 'dialog', 'written', 'Thornton', 'Epperson', 'rings', 'true', 'Raimi', 'direction', 'steady', 'assured', 'problem', 'material', 'B', 'picture', 'hardly', 'worth', 'concerted', 'efforts', 'A-list', 'talent', 'What', 'producers', 'need', 'learn', 'when', 'assemble', 'many', 'powerhouses', 'front', 'camera', 'people', 'expectations', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'roof', 'So', 'Gift', 'neat', 'little', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'disappoint']",N/A

Although it's predictable in places, it's not too predictable so you know what's going to happen before it happens, but certain scenes you can.I was quite shocked when I discovered Billy Bob Thornton wrote this, and that Sam Raimi directed it. Billy Bob always comes across as weird to me - he looks so rough most of the time, but then you see him in films, he's totally unrecognisable, and doesn't look like the same person. Sam Raimi is a whole other kettle of fish. He previously directed The Evil Dead movies, the second one, which I managed to fall asleep during!All the characters played their parts well in this. Especially Katie Holmes and Keanu Reeves. Both of them play different characters to what they would normally play in films. Katie is always known as sweet and virginal Joey in Dawson's Creek, but totally shows the viewers she can act and can do different characters. As a big fan of Keanu, I can't say I've seen him play a bad BAD guy, not to this extent anyway. His character is a wife beater, who does get accused of killing Katie's character. He could have been slagged rotten in the press and by critics for playing this kind of character, but he manages to pull it off, and succeeds. You believe in his character, and totally forget this is the guy from Speed, and the dork from Bill &amp; Ted. His hair is grown out, he's got an albeit patchy beard, and dare I say it, he's looking chubby! (But not as bad as Chain Reaction!) Keanu got praise when this film was released, and he could have been stereotyped after Speed (and probably now after the Matrix), but has pulled off a number of different roles. I was not expecting to like his character at all, and I didn't and that's what made me like the movie even better.I've never really been a big fan of Cate Blanchett, but she was perfect for this role. Giovanni Ribisi was great, and made you forget that he was ever in Friends, and Hilary Swank . . . Well, we have to admit her hair was bad, and she was looking positively anorexic. But they all did well.The extras on the DVD are your basic extras, with some cast &amp; crew interviews and a very short behind the scenes featurette, and TV/radio spots. The latter I can't stand on DVDs, as they just repeat the trailer over and over.All in all, a great movie. And I dare anyone to guess who the killer really is.

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 3]","Sam Raimi takes a detour from his blood and guts horror fare (that's Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and Army of Darkness to you Mundanes) to create this spooky picture about a woman with the, well...the gift to perform tarot readings for the local townsfolk. The movie is most specifically about the deep south and its inhabitants. This movie taught me that apparently everyone living in the south is some kind of freakish, backward, ill-educated slob. Such a sadsack cast of characters provides plenty for Kate Blanchett's character to do as a result. Mostly, she acts as a psychiatrist.More irritating is the use of completely non-Tarot-like reading. In a movie where Kate's character is perpetually harassed for her &quot;Satanic&quot; rituals of Tarot-reading, it's bizarre that an actual Tarot isn't used. Instead, we get the dumbed down version: symbols that represent the four elements, a star, a square, etc. The symbols are used to good effect -- when she reads the future of a murder victim, she draws four &quot;water&quot; cards. But really, couldn't they have used real Tarot cards? I expect a wee bit more daring from a guy who filmed an eyeball popping into a woman's mouth.But I digress. The two outstanding actors in this film are Keanu Reeves and Giovanni Ribisi. That's right, you saw me type that correctly -- Keanu Reeves. Keanu has a typically vapid look about him that makes him a canvas for more complex stories. I call it the Kevin Costner effect. This is why he works so well in the Matrix -- he's bland enough to allow the ridiculously complex backstory of the Matrix to swirl around him. But what's most startling is to see that vacuous stare used to startling effect in The Gift. Add a few pounds, give Keanu a shaggy beard, and his soft brown eyes become the cold glaze of a killer. Or at least, a wife beater. He pulls it off with terrifying menace. It made me want to rent The Watcher just to see if this was a fluke or due to Sam's influence.Giovanni, of course, plays a psychotic. Gee, who would have thought, Giovanni playing a weird creepy guy! Still, he's like the Jack Nicholson of our era, because he does it SO WELL.Ultimately, the movie was predictable. Maleficent and I trakced every single surprise, the twist ending, everything -- we mapped this puppy out in perfect detail and were never wrong once. Does this make it a bad movie? Not at all. Does it make it a great movie? Alas, not. Sam can do better. But we still love ya Sam.",3,Raimi can do better.

Annie is a widow who lost her husband to a tragedy a year earlier and is left with three young boys, Annie has ""The Gift"" of esp and reads fortunes to the locals with her tarot cards to support her and her family.Using numerous talented actors and actresses Raimi spins a different kind of ""web"" here in The Gift, one of talent where most performers are playing opposite roles you are accustomed to seeing them in.  Hilary Swank plays Valerie Barksdale a weak minded, dependent, and battered wife who sees Annie for advice but doesn't take it, a bit of a departure from previous roles but Swank never has a problem letting us in or being vulnerable.  Keanu Reeves plays her nasty abusive husband Donnie Barksdale a departure from being the good guy, he threatens to hurt Annie and her children if she puts any ideas of leaving him into her head again.  Katie Holmes just beams of wholesomeness and is the quintessential good girl, not this time however here she plays Jessica King daughter of a wealthy man and is engaged to the principal of the local school, all sounds good so far but she is unfaithful with a sexual thirst that her fiance can't quench and bares all for this role.  Jessica is having an affair with Donnie among others and somehow after a fight ends up in his pond a long way from Dawson's Creek, minus a pulse.  Greg Kinnear plays Wayne Collins the principal of the local school Annie's sons attend, and there is a connection between them albeit innocent, however he is engaged to loose Jessica again Kinnear's character takes an unexpected detour into a new kind of role for him.Last but certainly not least there is one other major piece to this puzzle and that is Giovanni Ribisi's character Buddy Cole who is an angry yet innocent man, mentally and psychologically damaged and deservedly so, who works at the local gas station and also sees Annie for advice as he says she is his only real friend.  Out of all this talent Ribisi stood out the most for me in this one, look for the part where he approaches Reeves's character while he is harassing one of Annie's sons, he stole the show for me there.Other noteworthy performances are J.K. Simmons as the Sheriff and a regular in Raimi's Spider Man films.  Rosemary Harris as Annie's passed grandmother also in Raimi's Spider Man as Peter Parker's Aunt and Gary Cole slimy attorney who also had an interest in Jessica King.There is your lineup of talent, most of these actors to me are the definition of versatility and bring there A games with seven Oscar Nominations and three wins amongst them.So to recap as I said you get a film by a talented director Raimi who is more than his awesome cult classic Evil Dead trilogy or Spider Man franchise, I also would recommend Raimi's Darkman.  The Gift as i said transcends genres being a Supernatural mystery thriller with images of horror, and drama filled with passion, lust and betrayal, something for any film lover.Who really killed Jessica King and will Annie's ""Gift"" uncover the truth?**DVD FEATURES**Exclusive Cast and crew interviewsMusic Video ""Furnace Room Lullaby"" performed by Neko Case & Her BoyfriendsTheatrical Trailer",4,4.5 Raimi spins a web of versatile talented actors and actresses in The Gift.

A moody and atmospheric supernatural mystery with stunning performances.The words creepy and spooky come to mind whenever I see a murky pond with rolling wet fog surrounding it.A sensitive widow living in the swampy backwoods with her children, who is both gifted and cursed with the supernatural power of second sight, is plagued by tormenting visions and desperate premonitions about the people around her.When you're in the mood for a cajun scream in the night, look no further.This movie has some disturbing imagery but it's far more interested in characterization than anything else, and that's the best kind of horror tale. Look ma, no gore.You mind becomes the frightening place here, along with what's on the screen.Watching Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi will tear your soul to pieces, they are truly amazing here, as is Keanu Reeves like you have never seen him before.An unforgettable motion picture.

But the first time I saw it, it is scary because the unexpected creepy scenes jump out at you,i.e. when the pyschic sees Jessica King dead. It's a mystery/thriller, and for once in his career Keanu Reeves does a great job as an abusive husband. Hilary Swank is also worthy to be in the film as his ignorant wife. And buddy, played by Giovanni something, played a disturbed kid who blocked out his rough childhood. The pyschic is more like a therapist if you ask me. She tries to help people with their problems, whether it be physical health problems or marriage problems and repressed memories.

583663,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00005JH9M,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[2, 3]","The Gift is destined to always be a three star out of five film, though don't let that dissuade you from watching it, because that's not to say that it's worthless.  Far from it.  Co-scripted by Billy Bob Thornton, The Gift relates the rather straightforward story of a woman (Cate Blanchett) haunted by her psychic visions of the murder of a young girl (Katie Holmes) from the backwater town she lives in.  Red herrings abound, almost to the point of ridiculousness where you begin to suspect pretty much every character bar Blanchett's.What lifts the movie out of its mediocrity is the fact that it's cast does so much with the slight material they've been handed.  Blanchett proves that Elizabeth was no fluke, giving a typically strong performance of a woman on the edge of breakdown.  Given her recent casting as lead in movies such as Charlotte Gray and Heaven, along with some high profile supporting roles in Lord of the Rings and The Talented Mr. Ripley, this is one actress who's undoubtedly going to go far.  Every bit as good as Blanchett though is Giovanni Ribisi, playing a deranged man-child who forms an unwholesome attachment to Blanchett.  His weepy yet electrifying performance rivets the movie in place in a much more powerful way that Keanu Reeves' bearded psycho could ever manage.  Surprisingly, director Sam Raimi has also managed to garner Oscar-winner Hilary Swank who, despite turning in a solid performance, gives the impression that Boys Don't Cry might have been the best role she's ever likely to get in a while if she's taking relatively small roles in something like this.Whilst this never reaches the highs of other recent ghost stories (The Sixth Sense, The Others and the Japanese version of Ring are all much better), this is nothing short of a solid effort from the director of zombie classic Evil Dead, and is rarely short of compelling.  If it lacks a little originality in the script give it some credit; there's a place for small-ish movies like this, especially given Raimi's latest blockbuster Spiderman.  In short - good, but no classic.",3,Talented cast lift this out of mediocrity,1083974400,"05 8, 2004",2004,2082,"['Gift', 'destined', 'always', 'be', 'three', 'star', 'five', 'film', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'dissuade', 'watching', 'not', 'say', 'worthless', 'Far', 'Co-scripted', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Gift', 'rather', 'straightforward', 'story', 'woman', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'haunted', 'psychic', 'visions', 'murder', 'young', 'girl', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'backwater', 'town', 'Red', 'herrings', 'abound', 'almost', 'point', 'ridiculousness', 'where', 'begin', 'suspect', 'pretty', 'much', 'character', 'bar', ""Blanchett's.What"", 'movie', 'mediocrity', 'fact', 'cast', 'so', 'much', 'slight', 'material', ""'ve"", 'been', 'handed', 'Blanchett', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'fluke', 'giving', 'typically', 'strong', 'performance', 'woman', 'edge', 'breakdown', 'Given', 'recent', 'casting', 'lead', 'movies', 'such', 'Charlotte', 'Gray', 'Heaven', 'high', 'profile', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'one', 'actress', 'who', 'undoubtedly', 'going', 'go', 'far', 'Every', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'Blanchett', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'playing', 'deranged', 'man-child', 'who', 'unwholesome', 'attachment', 'Blanchett', 'weepy', 'yet', 'electrifying', 'performance', 'movie', 'place', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'way', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'bearded', 'psycho', 'could', 'ever', 'manage', 'Surprisingly', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'also', 'managed', 'garner', 'Oscar-winner', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'who', 'turning', 'solid', 'performance', 'impression', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'role', 'ever', 'likely', 'get', 'while', 'taking', 'relatively', 'small', 'roles', 'something', 'this.Whilst', 'never', 'highs', 'other', 'recent', 'ghost', 'stories', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Others', 'Japanese', 'version', 'Ring', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'nothing', 'short', 'solid', 'effort', 'director', 'zombie', 'classic', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'rarely', 'short', 'compelling', 'little', 'originality', 'script', 'give', 'credit', 'place', 'small-ish', 'movies', 'especially', 'given', 'Raimi', 'latest', 'blockbuster', 'Spiderman', 'short', 'good', 'classic']",N/A

583665,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JH9M,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[11, 11]","In this movie co-written by Billy Bob Thornton (with Tom Epperson), director Sam Raimi successfully produces an enjoyable often edge of the seat part courtroom, part psychic gothic thriller, starring the excellent Aussie actress Cate Blanchett and a fine ensemble cast.Set in small town Georgia, Blanchett plays Annie Wilson, a financially struggling, recently widowed, lonely single parent who uses her card reading psychic ability to pay the bills. Among her clients are a battered wife, Valerie Barksdale (wonderfully played by Hilary Swank) and a traumatised local mechanic named Buddy Cole (brilliantly played by Giovanni Ribisi), who is struggling to hold onto his sanity. Traumatised by recurring visions surrounding the death of local tramp Jessica King (Katie Holmes), she sets out to help the police find the body and find the killer. The prime suspect is Donnie Barksdale played by Keanu Reeves, who gives a passable performance, as Swank's violent wife-beating bully of a husband. He was known to be having an affair with Holmes and previously threatened to kill Annie and so starts the courtroom drama that dominates the middle of the film.The strength of this gothic noir movie really is in the suspense, the expectation of doom and the excellent performances from Blanchett, Ribisi and Swank, with good support from Katie Holmes. It is subtly directed by Raimi and he expertly brings a southern gothic feel to the whole movie. However, Keanu Reeves and Greg Wise (as Holmes fianc&eacute;e) are not quite as strong and I felt the movie tailed off slightly at the end, with the inevitable slightly predictable `twist', which most people will see coming a mile off. That said it's well worth a view, definitely above average and a bit of a must for Blanchett and Raimi fans particularly.",4,"BLANCHETT, SWANK AND RIBISI SHINE!!!",1010534400,"01 9, 2002",2002,1799,"['movie', 'co-written', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Tom', 'Epperson', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'successfully', 'enjoyable', 'often', 'edge', 'seat', 'part', 'courtroom', 'part', 'psychic', 'gothic', 'thriller', 'starring', 'excellent', 'Aussie', 'actress', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'cast.Set', 'small', 'town', 'Georgia', 'Blanchett', 'Annie', 'Wilson', 'financially', 'struggling', 'recently', 'widowed', 'lonely', 'single', 'parent', 'who', 'card', 'reading', 'psychic', 'ability', 'pay', 'bills', 'clients', 'are', 'battered', 'wife', 'Valerie', 'Barksdale', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'traumatised', 'local', 'mechanic', 'named', 'Buddy', 'Cole', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'who', 'struggling', 'hold', 'sanity', 'Traumatised', 'recurring', 'visions', 'surrounding', 'death', 'local', 'tramp', 'Jessica', 'King', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'out', 'help', 'police', 'find', 'body', 'find', 'killer', 'prime', 'suspect', 'Donnie', 'Barksdale', 'played', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'who', 'passable', 'performance', 'Swank', 'violent', 'wife-beating', 'bully', 'husband', 'was', 'known', 'be', 'having', 'affair', 'Holmes', 'previously', 'threatened', 'kill', 'Annie', 'so', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'middle', 'film.The', 'strength', 'gothic', 'noir', 'movie', 'really', 'suspense', 'expectation', 'doom', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Blanchett', 'Ribisi', 'Swank', 'good', 'support', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'subtly', 'directed', 'Raimi', 'expertly', 'southern', 'gothic', 'feel', 'whole', 'movie', 'However', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'Holmes', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'e', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'strong', 'felt', 'movie', 'tailed', 'off', 'slightly', 'end', 'inevitable', 'slightly', 'predictable', 'twist', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'off', 'said', 'well', 'view', 'definitely', 'above', 'average', 'bit', 'must', 'Blanchett', 'Raimi', 'fans', 'particularly']",N/A

Blanchett plays a fortune teller, earning small cash to help in the raising of her 3 kids after recently being widowed from her husband. While she has many friends in the town, she also has enemies who are quick to label her a witch.When a local well respected business man's daughter goes missing (played by Katie Holmes, best remembered for her topless scene in this film), her father, fiance (Kinnear) and local sheriff enlist the aid of Blanchetts character (Annie Wilson) to use her 'gift' to help find the girl.Wilson has a vision that the girl is indeed dead and after a dream that night at home, realises that she is at the bottom of a pond in the bottom of Donnie Barksdale's pond. Barksdale (played by Keanu Reeves) is known to be a wife beater and also a foe of Annie's, who resents her for giving advice and readings for his wife Valerie (Hillary Swank).When Barksdale is convicted for the girls murder half way through the movie we soon realise that all is not as it may seem, and Annie has more visions, this time of Barksdale innocence, and here the gueesing game begins.I guessed the ending, but only after 2 or 3 guesses, the director does a good job of leading you down one road and then quickly turning a corner.

Whatever your poison, you're gonna need it....This is a well-shot film, with some pretty cool effects in Blancett's &quot;psychic&quot; scenes, though the film's tendency for shots of tree branches waving above gets tedious. After a while, I began to theorize that how much the branches were waving were indicative of the degree of the gender role crisis at work on the main character (there's a thesis!). On the whole, even the good acting and semi-effective tension-builders can't salvage the utterly predictable and outright monotonous plot.The nice thing about the psychic schtick (or the 'blind psychic' found in some movies) is that it lets the writers get away with the tedium of knowledge progression so that they can instead &quot;shock&quot; the audience (more like &quot;schlock&quot;).My roommate called the badguy about 15 minutes into the thing, so you can understand why alcohol consumption is the only way to make the rest of it of any use. This movie shows why *scary* thrillers these days are only successful when they are SO obtuse as to be totally incomprehensible (*Wild Things*, *Bone Collector*, etc.).

There are many reviews posted already and one can easily gather major and minor elements of the plot from those reviews, but basically, this is a psychic experience kind of movie intertwined with a murder mystery.Does the movie work for the viewer? On some levels, yes. Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi carry the movie with their intense intimate portrayals. The mystery persists well to near the end of the movie.If there was a weakness in this movie, it was a case of too many star actors/actresses. The movie would have been considerably more believable without the additional stars in secondary roles. Cate Blanchett could have carried this movie on her own with help from the very talented Ribisi. I found both Keanu Reeves and Hilary Swank a distraction who were too high recognition as leads in their own right, and both of these roles would have been better cast with lesser known actors. J. K. Simmons played what seemed like a stereotypical role for him. I suspect the movie may have been dated by these actors becoming much better known since the release of this film.The entire cast struggled with their southern accents which didn't always hold well throughout the movie, and several times, I thought the makeup looked a bit unrealistic, though this may be a problem with viewing it in HD which more readily reveals minor flaws. With the too well known cast, and occasional varying accents, the makeup slips, every now and then you realize you are just watching a movie and one can't remain fully immersed. Even with all of these minor flaws, the movie is worth a first time view. If you like Cate Blanchett, who is one of may favorites, you will like this movie.

583680,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B00005JH9M,Ping Lim,"[2, 14]","Sam Raimi has definitely coming of age directing this movie.  This happened to be the person who produced the TV series, Hercules, &amp; who used to direct the B-movie, Return of the Dead.  This movie was written by Billy Bob Thorton, who together with his newly wed wife, Angeline Jollie formed the scariest couple in Hollywood.  But there's no denying his talent in writing such a good story.  This movie was filled with A-list stars and they all  mastered their Southern accent drawl in this instance.  My initial concern was whether Sam had the capacity to keep the tension thru the whole movie, the ability of him to draw depths from characters that the actors and actresses were performing and I'm pleased to say that he did with flying colours. This movie reminded me of &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; and &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot;.  It was taken place in the Deep South where Kate Blanchett's character was a widow living on the breadline with three children, and also a card reader and a psychic.  She had Giovanni Ribisi's (Saving Private Ryan, gone in 60 Seconds) character and Hilary Swank's (Boys Don't Cry) character under her care.  Giovanni was a mentally ill car mechanic whilst Hilary was  the abused wife of Keanu Reeves' character.  Keanu played a red neck (unconvincingly) and who had a chip on his shoulder against Kate for constantly encouraging Hilary to leave him for a better life.  So, he started to threaten Kate's family hoping that Kate wouldn't consult Hilary anymore.  One day, it just happened that Kate's son was involved in a school brawl &amp; that's when she met Greg Kinnear's (Sabrina, As Good As It Gets) character who was the School Principal &amp; his soon to be wed fiancee (Katie Holmes of Dawsons Creek).  Being a psychic, Kate felt strongly that Katie was to die soon.  Soon after, in a party, Greg &amp; Kate started to feel affection for one another whilst Kate accidentally bumped into Katie who was flirting with a male stranger in a toilet.  It wasn't long before Katie was found missing.  Greg came to Kate for help through spiritual means &amp; thru many flashbacks, she determined Katie's burial place, beneath a pond in Keanu's compound.  Then, the movie changed mode into a court room drama reminded us of &quot;A Time To Kill&quot;.  The witness testified that the night before Katie was missing, she was spotted having a fight with Keanu.  As Keanu changed his testimony &amp; he had a wound inflicted by Katie, he was jailed for good.  But the story wasn't finished yet as Kate had got more premonitions that Keanu might not be the killer afterall.  Could it be Hilary who killed Katie to frame Keanu so that she could then lead a good life, could it be Katie's lover who killed her in the heat of passion, could it be Greg who found out of his fiancee's promiscuity and killed her in a rage, could it be the Prosecutor of the case who happened to be the stranger in the toilet with Katie the in the party to conceal his secret?  The overall direction of the movie was quite splendid by providing viewers with sufficient clues to keep us guessing until the big climax in the end.  The ending was quite satisfactory with a twist.

Cate Blanchett stars as Annie Wilson, a young widow attempting to raise her three kids and provide a decent life for her family, scraping out a living on Social Security since the tragic death of her husband in a work related accident the previous year.  She supplements her meager income by doing &#65533;readings&#65533; for the local townsfolk, accepting their donations for the insights she offers them into their own lives.  Annie has a &#65533;gift,&#65533; the ability to see certain things in the cards that enables her to advise her clients about personal issues.  It&#65533;s something she can&#65533;t explain; she knows only that it&#65533;s inherited (which she learned from her grandmother), and that it&#65533;s real.  And though it&#65533;s helped her maintain her home, she soon finds that it doesn&#65533;t always make for the most pleasant of situations, as when she must advise a young woman, Valerie Barksdale (Hilary Swank), on how to cope with her abusive husband, Donnie (Keanu Reeves), or attempt to help a troubled young man, Buddy Cole (Giovanni Ribisi) come to terms with some sensitive aspects of his life.  Then, when a client comes to her to ask for help when his daughter disappears, not only does it take her to the dark side of the human experience, she discovers that certain individuals, including local sheriff Pearl Johnson (J.K. Simmons) do not believe that her &#65533;gift&#65533; is real.Stylistically crafted and delivered, Raimi&#65533;s film will keep you engrossed and on the edge of your seat until the very end.  He successfully blends reality with just a touch of the supernatural that makes for riveting suspense while keeping it within the realm of believability.  The relationship played out between Donnie and Valerie is anything but unique-- you&#65533;ve seen this before, many times in many films-- but within the context of this story it&#65533;s fresh and it works.  The doubtful sheriff and the cynical, jaded defense attorney, Gerald Weems (Michael Jeter), are fairly stereotypical, but that can be easily overlooked in light of the overall story and especially due to the credibility of the Annie character, which is well developed and never presented as anything beyond what can be readily accepted as true to life.  As the central character, Annie anchors the film and enables the circumstances in which she is involved to be perceived as real; it&#65533;s the strength of the film, and it&#65533;s what makes it all work so well.What also makes it work is the strong performance by Cate Blanchett, who makes Annie so real and accessible, displaying her &#65533;gift&#65533; with restraint and avoiding the possible pitfall of taking it too far over the edge, which could easily have made it suspect.  Instead, she brings a depth to the character that draws you into her world and allows you to empathize with her, which would have been impossible had she invested Annie with even a touch of the charlatan.  With consummate skill, Blanchett creates a well rounded character which demonstrates that as an actor, she definitely has a very real &#65533;gift&#65533; of her own.Ribisi also does a memorable turn as Buddy, with a striking performance in which he creates some disturbing moments that are almost painful to watch; his is a character study of a soul in distress, seeking solace and resolution, and even as he attempts to sort out his life, you are able to sympathize with his plight as you share Buddy&#65533;s experiences.  And it&#65533;s through Buddy (as well as Annie, of course), that the audience is able to make that necessary and very real connection with the film.  With films like &#65533;Saving Private Ryan&#65533; and now this one, Ribisi is on his way to establishing himself as one of the premiere character actors in the business today.Playing somewhat against type, Reeves proves that he can be a good &#65533;bad&#65533; guy, giving possibly one of his best performances ever as Donnie.  He very credibly conveys that sense of explosiveness lying just beneath the surface that makes his character menacing and dark, which in turn makes Donnie psychologically as well as physically threatening.  It&#65533;s a good job by Reeves, who deserves credit for taking on a role that is so disagreeable and insensitive.The supporting cast includes Greg Kinnear (Wayne), Katie Holmes (Jessica), Kim Dickens (Linda), Gary Cole (David) and Rosemary Harris (Annie&#65533;s Granny).  A taut thriller that is emotionally involving, &#65533;The Gift&#65533; delivers what it promises early on, which is exceptional, as many films of this nature often fail to actually follow through after a tremendous opening act.  Rest assured, this one does and has it all; suspense, credibility and some memorable moments, all courtesy of Raimi, a good story and a superb cast.  And that&#65533;s the magic of the movies.",4,Raimi Delivers On His Promise,999993600,"09 9, 2001",2001,5114,"['small', 'town', 'deep', 'South', 'single', 'mother', 'endowed', 'special', 'ability', 'becomes', 'involved', 'disappearance', 'young', 'woman', 'brush', 'supernatural', '65533', 'Gift', '65533', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'Annie', 'Wilson', 'young', 'widow', 'attempting', 'raise', 'three', 'kids', 'provide', 'decent', 'life', 'family', 'scraping', 'out', 'living', 'Social', 'Security', 'tragic', 'death', 'husband', 'work', 'related', 'accident', 'previous', 'year', 'meager', 'income', 'doing', '65533', 'readings', '65533', 'local', 'townsfolk', 'accepting', 'donations', 'insights', 'own', 'lives', 'Annie', '65533', 'gift', '65533', 'ability', 'see', 'certain', 'things', 'cards', 'advise', 'clients', 'personal', 'issues', '65533', 's', 'something', 'can', '65533', 't', 'explain', 'only', '65533', 's', 'inherited', 'learned', 'grandmother', '65533', 's', 'real', '65533', 's', 'helped', 'maintain', 'home', 'soon', '65533', 't', 'always', 'make', 'most', 'pleasant', 'situations', 'when', 'must', 'advise', 'young', 'woman', 'Valerie', 'Barksdale', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'how', 'cope', 'abusive', 'husband', 'Donnie', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'attempt', 'help', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'Buddy', 'Cole', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'come', 'terms', 'sensitive', 'aspects', 'life', 'Then', 'when', 'client', 'ask', 'help', 'when', 'daughter', 'disappears', 'not', 'only', 'take', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'experience', 'certain', 'individuals', 'including', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Pearl', 'Johnson', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'do', 'not', 'believe', '65533', 'gift', '65533', 'real.Stylistically', 'crafted', 'delivered', 'Raimi', '65533', 's', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'engrossed', 'edge', 'seat', 'very', 'end', 'successfully', 'reality', 'just', 'touch', 'supernatural', 'riveting', 'suspense', 'keeping', 'realm', 'believability', 'relationship', 'played', 'out', 'Donnie', 'Valerie', 'anything', 'unique', '65533', 've', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'many', 'films', 'context', 'story', '65533', 's', 'fresh', 'doubtful', 'sheriff', 'cynical', 'jaded', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Gerald', 'Weems', 'Michael', 'Jeter', 'are', 'fairly', 'stereotypical', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'light', 'overall', 'story', 'especially', 'due', 'credibility', 'Annie', 'character', 'well', 'developed', 'never', 'presented', 'anything', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'readily', 'accepted', 'true', 'life', 'central', 'character', 'Annie', 'film', 'circumstances', 'involved', 'be', 'perceived', 'real', '65533', 's', 'strength', 'film', '65533', 's', 'what', 'work', 'so', 'well.What', 'also', 'work', 'strong', 'performance', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'Annie', 'so', 'real', 'accessible', 'displaying', '65533', 'gift', '65533', 'restraint', 'avoiding', 'possible', 'pitfall', 'taking', 'too', 'far', 'edge', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'made', 'suspect', 'Instead', 'depth', 'character', 'world', 'empathize', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'had', 'invested', 'Annie', 'even', 'touch', 'charlatan', 'consummate', 'skill', 'Blanchett', 'well', 'rounded', 'character', 'actor', 'definitely', 'very', 'real', '65533', 'gift', '65533', 'own.Ribisi', 'also', 'memorable', 'turn', 'Buddy', 'striking', 'performance', 'disturbing', 'moments', 'are', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'character', 'study', 'soul', 'distress', 'seeking', 'solace', 'resolution', 'even', 'sort', 'out', 'life', 'are', 'able', 'sympathize', 'plight', 'share', 'Buddy', '65533', 's', 'experiences', '65533', 'Buddy', 'as', 'well', 'Annie', 'course', 'audience', 'able', 'make', 'necessary', 'very', 'real', 'connection', 'film', 'films', '65533', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', '65533', 'now', 'one', 'Ribisi', 'way', 'establishing', 'one', 'premiere', 'character', 'actors', 'business', 'today.Playing', 'somewhat', 'type', 'proves', 'can', 'be', 'good', '65533', 'bad', '65533', 'guy', 'giving', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'Donnie', 'very', 'credibly', 'conveys', 'sense', 'explosiveness', 'lying', 'just', 'surface', 'character', 'menacing', 'dark', 'turn', 'Donnie', 'psychologically', 'as', 'well', 'physically', 'threatening', '65533', 's', 'good', 'job', 'Reeves', 'who', 'credit', 'taking', 'role', 'so', 'disagreeable', 'insensitive.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Wayne', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Jessica', 'Kim', 'Dickens', 'Linda', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'David', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Annie', '65533', 's', 'Granny', 'taut', 'thriller', 'emotionally', 'involving', '65533', 'Gift', '65533', 'delivers', 'what', 'early', 'exceptional', 'many', 'films', 'nature', 'often', 'actually', 'follow', 'tremendous', 'opening', 'act', 'Rest', 'assured', 'one', 'suspense', 'credibility', 'memorable', 'moments', 'courtesy', 'Raimi', 'good', 'story', 'superb', 'cast', '65533', 's', 'magic', 'movies']",N/A

My favorite ghost films aren't available on DVD, and the incredible Sam Raimi created the perfect atmosphere to keep me sated until they do. Billy Bob Thornton's script had every element needed to satisfy this crave, and Raimi assembled an incredible ensemble to execute the final result. Cate Blanchett is magnificent (as always), and she takes you down her road of discovery with innocence and conviction. The biggest surprise, of course, is Keanu Reeves. HE CAN ACT! It was a treat to see him let down some barriers and create this horrible monster of a character. The entire ensemble is amazing (Greg Kinnear, Hilary Swank, Katie Holmes, Gary Cole), but aside from Blanchett, acting honors must go to Giovanni Ribisi as the sweet, confused village idiot ready to go over the edge. Michael Jeter also shines as a reprehensible defense attorney.  I hate it when people blab away plot points, so I won't do that. What Raimi has done is to take a wonderful story and give it his own inimitable spooky touch. Everyone is suspect, and I was shocked, scared and surprised at how it all evolved. Until THE HAUNTING ('63), THE INNOCENTS ('61) or THE UNINVITED ('44) are available, this would be your best bet on DVD. This is pretty much of a folk tale, but if you're looking for a recent honest-to-goodness Haunted House story, you might check out THE OTHERS (Nicole Kidman). The DVD transfer is excellent ( a good 1.85:1 LBX, like most indies), there's one of those gratuitous ""extras"", where the cast and director all talk about how wonderful each other was; a music video by Neko Case & Her Boyfriends (very folksy), and some trailers.

In order to make ends meet she reads the futures of residents in her Southern town. Among her regular clients are an abused wife (Hilary Swank) and an unstable man (Giovanni Ribisi) living in paralyzing fear of his father. Annie has her share of enemies and skeptics, the worst being a man named Donnie Barksdale (Keanu Reeves). Donnie is the abusive husband who soon redirects his anger towards Annie and her kids. Things are just as volatile at the boy's school where the oldest is always getting into fights. A concerned teacher (Greg Kinnear) reaches out to Annie to offer support. He is engaged to a young woman (Katie Holmes) whose father is a local businessman. When Annie pays him a visit she meets his fiancee. She receives a troubling vision regarding the girl but keeps it to herself. The next day the girl goes missing and both the teacher and the police appeal to Annie to read for them, hoping to find out what happened to her. As the police search for her, Annie continues to be haunted by visions that grow more violent. The film is stylishly directed by Sam Raimi and the script is co written by Billy Bob Thornton. The performances are solid with Blanchett excelling as Annie. Swank, Kinnear, and Ribisi provide solid supporting work. Holmes lays on her Southern drawl pretty thick but there's no denying she looks good doing it. Future 'Spider Man' alums Rosemary Harris and J.K. Simmons provide memorable turns in smaller roles.

It doesn't matter what he does to try and avoid being labelled a horror director; every film he makes will be compared to The Evil Dead. But then, in a perfect world, perhaps every review of every film ever made would contain a comparison to The Evil Dead, which is possibly the world's best example of what you can do with fifty grand and a whole lot of beer.So if you're going to get compared to The Evil Dead for the rest of your life, do what Sam Raimi did: go back to the Evil Tree motif. Gotta love evil trees.In this case, the evil tree stands in the yard of Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett), a fortune teller in a small town in Georgia. Wilson has a seemingly-thriving business telling fortunes for local folk, dispensing a kind of half-presaging half-advice to her clients. When her oldest child gets into trouble in school, she meets the principal, Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear), and his fiancee Jessica (Katie Holmes, looking as much like Ashley Judd as cosmetics can make her). Jessica soon goes missing, and Annie, psychic that she is, starts having some rather nasty visions. Imagine the twisted branches of the tree as a cinema screen and away you go.The plot and characterization are pure Billy Bob Thornton; lots of Sourthern redneck drawl, lots of mental defectives, lots of people doing incredibly stupid things that they don't think through that come back to haunt them. The film is perfectly cast, including a number of choices that seem odd on the surface (especially Blanchett; hard to imagine Queen Elizabeth as poor white trash, but it works), but that click quite well. The cast is high-caliber from soup to nuts, and they all play their roles to the hilt, including Giovanni Ribisi as an on-the-edge mechanic, Keanu Reeves as the jealous, abusive husband of Hilary Swank, and Gary Cole in his usual slimy role, this time as the town's prosecuting attorney. J. K. Simmons (Dr. Skoda on Law and Order) turns up as the town sherriff and shows us once and for all that he really isn't the open-minded psychiatrist he's typsecast as.This one didn't get nearly enough screen time when it came out.

In this case the rule was not broken and I found a film that is very entertaining, provides high quality suspense and presents a set of Southern characters that add flair to the story.Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett) is a recently widowed woman who is taking care of her three kids by working as a fortune teller. She is far from what most people see as the stereotype in this profession, since she cares about her customers and treats them as friends. This in turn leads to trouble, when the abusing husband of one of her clients warns her about intruding in their affairs. Almost simultaneously, Annie is summoned to the principal's office in their kids' school due to a problem with her oldest son and while she is there she has a very disturbing vision involving the principal's fianc&eacute;.The story picks up in pace reaching frantic speed when Jessica (Katie Holmes), the woman in Annie's vision, disappears and her father asks the fortune teller for help. Besides having to deal with this issue, Annie has to fight the disbelief of the police regarding her gift and also faces the escalating violence of Donnie Barksdale (Keanu Reeves), who refuses to go away and wants his wife Valerie (Hilary Swank) to stop going to Annie's house.This is a well crafted story that only lacks a little bit in the quality of the ending, which may be considered a tad too predictable. Everyone in the cast provides high level performances demonstrating why they are highly regarded in their profession. Besides Blanchett, Reeves, Swank and Holmes, we get to see Giovanni Ribisi playing a deranged young man. Those of you who watched ""Friends"" probably remember him for his role as Phoebe's brother.

Had me glued almost until the end, I did predict about 20 mins before the denouement who the killer could be, but that isn't too bad! I guess the movie's power lies in its character studies which happen to be wrapped in a homicide.Highly recommend this immaculate blend of high-octane drama and supernatural horror.

The film is a reasonably well-done and watchable mystery but, The Gift is really about the cast. Ribisi sizzles here in his tortured role. Although younger than Blancettt by five years, he plays much older. In contrast, two years later, starring with Blancett in, Heaven(2002), he plays younger even beyond the actual age difference. (If you're a Ribisi fan, you've seen it and know what I mean.) Also, watch for Hillary Swank as the spineless wife, and the rare chance to catch keanu Reeves as the bad guy, possibly very bad.

A small-town Georgia psychic, Annie tried to warn her husband about the upcoming accident, but he laughed it off.  Haunted by what might have been, Annie turns her efforts to helping her clients.Buddy Cole (Giovanni Ribisi) is a sweet, good-natured mechanic who is always willing to help Annie out, but he sometimes lashes out for apparently no reason at all.  Annie cannot get Buddy to start looking internally to fix the problems and she cannot always give Buddy the time and attention that he needs...Valerie Barksdale (Hilary Swank) is an abused, undereducated woman who is terrified to leave her husband.  Fearful for Valerie's life, Annie encourages her to leave her redneck husband, Donnie (Keanu Reeves), but Valerie is too frightened.  When Donnie discovers what Annie has been telling Valerie, he targets Annie and her three boys and does his best to terrify them into leaving his family alone.When a friend drags Annie off to a country club event, Annie is surprised to discover that the sweet school principal, Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear) who has been so helpful with her boys is engaged to Jessica King (Katie Holmes), the local princess.  It is too bad, because Annie feels the first sparks of passion for Wayne, something she hasn't felt for anyone since her husband died.  When Jessica shows up murdered a short time later, Annie starts hoping that maybe something will develop with Wayne.  But when no leads and a lack of clues lead the local police to Annie's door, however reluctantly, Annie finds that Jessica's ghost is ready and eager to be found - and now the killer is after her...The Gift was a moody and atmospheric psychological thriller that was made all the more suspenseful by the wonderful acting and slow-paced story that drove it.  Cate Blanchett is stunning in the lead role and is completely believable as a small-town Southern woman, desperately clinging to the life that she knows.  She is surrounded by a talented supporting cast, led by the surprisingly convincing Keanu Reeves as an abusive husband and ignorant redneck.  Hilary Swank and Giovanni Ribisi have long since perfected the sympathetic victim role and Greg Kinnear is likeable in his supporting romantic role.  The scenery was perfect and saturated with the emotions of the characters.  Though there are plenty of holes in the story and some random sidelines that could have been cut out, the wonderful acting in this film should not be missed.

Schell,"[1, 2]","As if we didn't have enough ghostly little tales in the past few years (The Sixth Sense, Stir Of Echoes, etc.), another comes down the pike with an interesting twist - the main character doesn't see ghosts, but she definitely knows when people are going to die.  The idea for the story supposedly based upon the psychic abilities of Virginia Faulkner Thornton (Billy Bob Thornton's mother - she predicted his Oscar win), ""The Gift"" is a trim little package of murder, trepidation and the supernatural, peppered with an all-star cast and crew of Oscar winners (Swank, Thornton) and nominees (Blanchett, Kinnear, Harris).Annie Wilson (Blanchett) is a humble mother of three quietly making a living in fictional Brixton, GA off of social security from her husband's death and performing psychic readings for the townspeople.  Her recitations consist of one burning taper and a bizarre deck of cards with various symbols (star, circle, wavy lines, etc.) printed on them.  Her abilities as a clairvoyant are honest and true but (wouldn't you know it) Brixton is a backwoods community full of conservatives, skeptics and zealous Christians that believe the reserved widow is a practicing witch.  One man in particular named Donnie Barksdale (Reeves) harbors a special hatred for Annie because his battered wife Valerie (Swank) has been visiting the psychic's home on a regular basis to receive readings.  Donnie harasses Annie, making direct threats to her and her sons and even breaking into her home to creatively render the word ""Satan"" with her cosmic deck.  When Jessica King, the aristocratic daughter (Holmes) of a Brixton bigwig, turns up missing Annie has a vision that will help the BPD locate her.  She is at first snubbed by the chief of police for her marked reputation but when authorities finally take a chance on her, Jessica's body is found on Donnie Barksdale's property and he is immediately taken into custody for her murder. There's a bigger game afoot however, and Annie must single-handedly solve the mystery before the killer attempts to silence her permanently.Blanchett does her best to look simultaneously frightened and determined as Annie, a woman who is against all odds.  We already have proof of her abilities as a dramatic actress (Elizabeth, Paradise Road) and she is not disappointing here, sporting a decent Georgian accent and making her character human despite her inhuman abilities.  Holmes looks too young for her role and it's hard to fathom the chemistry between the 22-year-old actress and her 38-year-old co-star Kinnear (my husband even remarked that she looked like a teenager wearing her mother's clothes).  It's even more weird to see her sexing up ""Office Space"" yeeah-guy Gary Cole (who is 45) in a scene involving bathroom whoopie.  I guess it's just another case of casting directors pitting a beautiful ing&eacute;nue with a handsome fogey twice their age (a la Richard Gere/Winona Ryder, Bo Derek/Dudley Moore, etc.).  Kinnear does an admirable job as Wayne Collins, but a project like this is too simple an undertaking for his acting skills; most likely it was a labor of love for him.  Reeves actually manages to himself seem intimidating as Donnie Barksdale and Swank plays another dimwitted southerner minus the sexual identity crisis.  Oscar nominee Rosemary Harris makes a brief appearance as Blanchett's intuitive grandmother.  Ribisi is the standout here as the erratic Buddy Cole, a man who is consistently on the precipice of a psychological meltdown.  He is a blubbering, tearful mess one minute, hot-blooded and precarious the next.  What is really compelling about Ribisi's performance is the inner turmoil divulged in his roan and expressive eyes.  We know all we need to know about his character's struggle to stay sane simply by surveying his face.  Not a lot of actors have the ability to embody their characters in this way and Ribisi is to be commended for making Buddy a dynamic and remarkable individual.  Although he has yet to get the Academy's attention, the future looks incredibly bright for him and it's almost certain that he will become a hot commodity in the next few years.""The Gift"" delivers most of what it promises but sci-fi/horror fans will most likely be disappointed by its artsy approach (compliments of director Sam Raimi), its failure to scare the bejesus out of them (The Gift has MINOR scares) and its sad predictability.  The story manages to point an accusing finger at everyone but about halfway through (or even sooner) it's easy to identify the culprit.

She gets money from social security as well as supplements her income by doing psychic readings for many people in the town. One of her clients (Swank, who you can always count on for a remarkable performance) has an abusive husband (Reeves, fantastic as a wifebeater redneck here) who thinks what Annie does is witchcraft and he threatens her life as well as the lives of her children if she is to read for his wife ever again. Then, the daughter (Holmes) of an important man goes missing. She's engaged to a man named Wayne who works at the school where Annie's boys go (I believe he is the principal, but I could be mistaken...sorry, but in any event, played by Greg Kinnear). But there is much more than meets this eye in this gripping tale, and soon the police, with no clues as to where the daughter is, turn to Annie and her powerful gift to see if it can lead them in the right direction.I won't spoil the rest of it for those that have not seen The Gift. Look for an amazing Giovanni Ribisi in the substory as well...he's terrific here. If you enjoy thrillers and are intrigued by the plot, The Gift is something you will surely treasure as I have.

583702,A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,B00005JH9M,The Groove,"[11, 11]","""The Gift"" is a moody, atmospheric thriller that, despite its sometimes formulaic plot, soars on the strength of its ensemble cast. Cate Blanchett, already on a roll with films as diverse as ""Elizabeth,"" ""An Ideal Husband,"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" shines as Annie Wilson, a single mom who makes a living reading people's fortunes in a rural setting down south. An Australian in a pitch-perfect southern drawl, Blanchet sinks deeply into her role, making it one of the most underrated performances ever. Annie gets caught into a web of drama when she tries to counsel Valerie (Hilary Swank, back in ""Boys Don't Cry"" mode) who's being abused by her boorish, redneck husband Donnie (Keanu Reeves). To say the least, Donnie isn't thrilled to have his wife get counseling from a fortune teller, and he begins to threaten both Annie and her kids. All this leads to a murder mystery, which contains spoilers that I won't reveal. Director Sam Raimi, who also directed the solid ""A Simple Plan"" and this summer's ""Spider-Man,"" does a competent job at moving the film at a decent pace, and performances from Greg Kinnear, Giovanni Ribisi, and Katie Holmes stand out as well. But while the spotlight belongs to Blanchett, the film's revelation is definitely Keanau Reeves, who--dare I say it--brings an intensity to his role that makes his redneck character truly disturbing.

583708,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B00005JH9M,Wayne C. Rogers,"[2, 2]","Sam Rami, better known for directing the ""Evil Dead"" and ""Spiderman"" series of films, did a gem of a movie several years ago with a cast that included two Oscar winners (Cate Blanchett and Hilary Swank) and Oscar-nominated Greg Kinnear.  Keanu Reeves, in one of his better performances, is in it, along with Giovanni Ribisi, Katie Holmes and Michael Jeter.  What an all-star cast!  If that wasn't enough, Oscar winner, Billy Bob Thornton, and Tom Epperson wrote the script.  What they created was something very special.  It wasn't so much a horror movie as a thriller centered on a widowed mother of three, living in a small southern town and who's able to see the future of other people and the turmoil this eventually creates when the town's promiscuous debutante is murdered.  In many ways, I consider The Gift to be Rami's best film to date because of its humanity, its look at a special skill that I believe some people actually have, the premise that there is life after death and that spirits of loved ones can communicate with us, and the struggle of one person has to endure to tell the truth, no matter what the cost to her and her family.The Gift refers to the psychic ability that widowed Annie Wilson (played by Blanchett) has and how she uses it for card readings to support her family.  Keeping a low profile and with many of the town's women coming to her for practical and emotional advice each day, Annie suddenly finds herself caught in the middle of a controversy when she psychically sees the murder of the town's sexually active debutante (played by Katie Holmes).  Because of the Annie's visions, the local sheriff is led to believe that the abusive husband (Keanu Reeves) of one of her clients (Hilary Swank) is the murderer, especially since he was having an affair with her.  It doesn't help that Reeves' character had also been harassing and threatening Annie's family because of the advice she'd given to his wife.  All, however, isn't what it seems.  There are lies and deceptions to weed through, and Annie will have to put her life on the line to get to the truth.What made this move work for me was the realism that Cate Blanchett brought to the role of Annie Wilson. Though British, Blanchett seemed to become an actual low-income woman of the South with three kids to take care of and no prospects of a better future since the death of her husband.  I, as a viewer, immediately cared for Annie and her struggles and what she went through after the murder of Katie Holmes' character.  Of course, it helps that all of the other actors were right on the mark, too.  Keanu Reeves captured the meanness of a redneck abusive husband and the fear he can generate in the lives of the women around him perfectly.  Giovanni Ribisi was also great as one of Annie's clients--a mechanic with his own demons to battle, yet he's secretly in love with her and always takes up for her and her children, even at the end.  Then, there's Greg Kinnear as the good-hearted school principal, who is the fianc&eacute;e of Katie Holmes' character, and whom you hope will get together with Annie by the end of the film.  The acting is superb and the script flawless and the direction brings everything together into a film that's on its way to becoming a classic.  Let me just say again that this isn't a horror movie, but rather a suspenseful thriller with strong supernatural overtones.  This is definitely a movie I can watch over and over again, and still enjoy it.  The DVD has a behind-the-scenes' featurette that is quite good.

I decided to watch this one solely because it was co-written by Billy Bob Thornton and because the brilliant Giovanni Ribisi was in the cast. Much to my surprise, I found a bevy of good reasons to watch this film. Aside from the script, which is subtle and realistically written, actor after actor really blew me away. Ribisi, as I said, is one of the finest younger actors I have seen come down the pike in a long while. He really shines here as the troubled Buddy. But Cate Blanchett and Greg Kinnear are just wonderful. Even Keanu Reeves does a serviceable job as a redneck S.O.B.Horror movies are a real love of mine. Calling this a horror movie is a bit simplistic, but it certainly has that element and a number of quite creepy scenes. Do NOT expect some gore fest or a typical shocker. Like the swampy, slow town where the film is set, the movie flows along with a great deal of restraint and allows the viewer to become immersed in the characters and goings-on. All in all a good job, and something new that doesn't stink. Kudos to writers and cast.My one caveat is that I found the ending a little stiff and cliche. No real surprises there, and it ventures into sappy territory at the end. Overall a great watch though.
