This is a quiet little who-dunnit that keeps you on the edge of your favorite chair to the end.  The story seems like a straight forward bank holdup by a good cop gone bad, until gradually every detail of the case in question is expertly exposed and each  of the players is spotlighted to be revealed as to who they really are.  James Spader continues to grow as an actor and does particularly well in holding our attention thru the many avenues of flashback in this story.  The remainder of the cast is excellent (especially the fine and beautiful Lesley Stefanson). Relax, folks, this is a story to take you away from your daily routine and, as such, begs you to indulge your need to spin off on cinematic diversions.

727960,AMS8RT7TRF1ID,B00007G1TX,Jean Mills,"[11, 11]","John Parker (James Spader) is a L.A. cop who has become involved with other detectives in grabbing drug money by busting dealers and then keeping the money for themselves.  Evidently this has been going on for some years and finally Parker's partner wants out but is killed of course before that can happen.  As a result, Parker has gone away so he can do some soul searching, can get his mind right and can figure out just how to handle this problem.  TA DA!!!NEW PROBLEM.  He has now become the prime suspect in a bank robbery. On his first night in town, Parker goes to the local bar where Natalie Wright (Lesley Stefanson) picks him up.  They spend the night together and find they are very compatible.  Early in the morning he finds himself at the ATM of the bank that is being robbed.  From here the story takes off and you are going to find this to be a very entertaining film and also very sexy at times without the smut that usually goes with it.  Spader and Stefanson do have great chemistry.  This is a must see for Spader fans of course and even if you are not, you will find this to be a very interesting movie and fun to watch.  Guess what?  You love the FBI agent.. It's true; you can't help yourself. You will not be bored with this movie.

727961,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00007G1TX,Larry VanDeSande,"[38, 39]","Here is an excellent low-budget film produced in Canada with a couple stars and more plot twists and turns than a West Virginia road.The real star of this flick is producer-director Rowdy Herrington, the director of ""Gladiator"" and ""Bobby Jones"". ""The Stickup"" has one of the most intelligent and involving scripts I've ever seen in a low-budget film. The direction is also first rate with all the players pulling off their roles intelligently and credibly.There is hardly a cliche or nitwit character to be found in this well crafted mystery about theft, betrayal and absolution. The morality play is small potatoes in this little actioner, which deserves a larger audience. It most reminds me of the early Coen brothers' ""Blood Simple"" and John Carpernter's ""Assault on Precinct 13"" (recently remade with a lot of stars), two movies that started important long lasting film careers.I see big budget Hollywood flicks every day that can't hold a candle to this little movie. It appears Herrington didn't have much of a budget to work with up there in Canada, where the dollar buys more than in Los Angeles, but he made the most of it. He also coaxed good performances from his principal players and produced an interesting drama.This movie may start slowly but it will keep you guessing throughout its 90 minutes.
