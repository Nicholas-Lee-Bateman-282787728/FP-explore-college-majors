True, the acting,scripting, FX, and pacing were cellar dwelling, but occasionally the theme of a film emerges to pick up one's interest if one is previously inclined as I was to get involved. The end of the world via a biblically based deluge had been done recently in 2012, but 40 DAYS AND NIGHTS pushes the viewer to see the human race under a cyclical lens. Most of the characters were interested more or less in saving humanity and their desire to save a selected few reduced what otherwise would have been pointless drivel. I was reminded of the 50's disaster film WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE in that both dealt with the morality of choosing a few to live from unsuspecting billions with no chance.

Let me say there is a BIG difference between this "" 40 days and nights'"" and the movie I wanted ""40 days and 40 nights"". I turned it off after a short time, but came back, for some reason, and waited for the ""its about time"" ending. Ignoring the illogical SiFi link, the story was not only improbable, illogical, ill causing, ""illy"" written, directed, acted and when the illogical ending occurred it would be illogical for them to survive (they failed to saving inserts and honey bees),and had few plants and almost no animals.  I liked the three block long ship (holding 1000's of people"" bobbing up and down some 20 or 30 feet (given the scale) and everyone walked normal, unless you count hitting a mountain and having it produce a small bump that make them hang on to their chairs. And the 12"" rock that the ship was hung up on ""barely"", then being blowed up by a mystery chemical mixture, and the captain moving the ""shift lever"" from forward to reverse 6 times was really awe inspiringly stupid.  The time warp scene changes were really bad, planes taking off without a run way, dayschanging about 5 minutes apart, 1000's of ""relatives from St Louis"" being represented by 10 or 12 ""actors?"" they could afford to hire and illogically and effectively killing one of the two persons that could fix and install the ""miracle"" power generator the size of a small end table, seemed dumb because he told his girl friend there was a terrible storm coming. YAA REALLY? I could list a lot of other bad things but will end on perhaps the only positive note. That being a 5' heroine (Tessa ""played by"" Monaca Keena..I think) who they kept in tight wet fitting T-shirts who must have been standing in a cold breeze given the view it repeatedly advertised.
