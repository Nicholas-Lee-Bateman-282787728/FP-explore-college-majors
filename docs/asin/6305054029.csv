Valentine ""v2hearts2""","[5, 6]","I have been a Smokey fan since the sixties when he came on thescene.The think what they did at Motown back then will never beduplicated in any shape, form or fashion. Since Motown will not release footage of concerts from their former acts...it was really great to get this DVD. I play it all day on weekends and his CD's everyday on my way to work. I saw Smokey Robinson at the Resorts International in Atlantic City June 7, 2003 and hestill got it. His voice gets better with age and so does he. Youfeel like you are the only person in the concert hall. I wish there were more concerts of his on DVD, I have the other one too.Keep doing what you do BEST...Simply the Best.",5,"SIMPLY THE ""BEST""",1060041600,"08 5, 2003",2003,674,"['have', 'been', 'Smokey', 'fan', 'sixties', 'when', 'came', 'thescene.The', 'think', 'what', 'did', 'Motown', 'back', 'then', 'will', 'never', 'beduplicated', 'shape', 'form', 'fashion', 'Motown', 'will', 'not', 'release', 'footage', 'concerts', 'former', 'acts', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'get', 'DVD', 'play', 'day', 'weekends', 'CD', 'everyday', 'way', 'work', 'saw', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'Resorts', 'International', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'June', '7', '2003', 'got', 'voice', 'better', 'age', 'so', 'Youfeel', 'are', 'only', 'person', 'concert', 'hall', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'concerts', 'DVD', 'have', 'other', 'one', 'too.Keep', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'BEST', 'Simply', 'Best']",N/A

Brown,"[1, 1]","First let me say, that most of the DVD concerts offered of Old School classic artists are either of very poor quality or show the artists performing a lousy set of song selctions.  I know because I collect DVD concerts whenever I can find good ones.  Unfortunately, Amazon often fails to list the songs performed on a specific DVD, making it more difficult to select a good concert.  This DVD is the exception.  Smokey is on top of his game and at his best in this concert!  Additionally, he performs some of his greatest hits, some of which he has not performed in a long time.  As a bonus he performs some more recent songs which are in the classic Smokey style and tradition!...All Smokey fans must get this DVD!",4,CLASSIC SMOKEY!,1252281600,"09 7, 2009",2009,715,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'most', 'DVD', 'concerts', 'offered', 'Old', 'School', 'classic', 'artists', 'are', 'very', 'poor', 'quality', 'show', 'artists', 'performing', 'lousy', 'set', 'song', 'selctions', 'know', 'collect', 'DVD', 'concerts', 'whenever', 'can', 'find', 'good', 'ones', 'Unfortunately', 'Amazon', 'often', 'list', 'songs', 'performed', 'specific', 'DVD', 'making', 'more', 'difficult', 'select', 'good', 'concert', 'DVD', 'exception', 'Smokey', 'top', 'game', 'best', 'concert', 'Additionally', 'greatest', 'hits', 'not', 'performed', 'long', 'time', 'bonus', 'more', 'recent', 'songs', 'are', 'classic', 'Smokey', 'style', 'tradition', 'Smokey', 'fans', 'must', 'get', 'DVD']",N/A
