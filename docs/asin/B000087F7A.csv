The girl ends up in foster care and goes from home to home.  The homes aren't exactly the best places for children either, so you see the girl becoming more and more bitter and jaded.  She also has to contend with her mother, who is very manipulative.This movie is based on a great book.  The two stories stay pretty close to each other, which I really liked.

After I watched this movie I STILL only had a basic idea of the plot.Astrid's mother is hauled away from her artists studio and placed in prison for murdering her wayward lover. Astrid herself spends the next few years bouncing around from one dysfunctional foster family to another. In each home she begins to make herself over in the shadow of her foster mother. Every time Astrid sees her Mother in prison the murderess manages to drag the child away from whatever happiness and comfort she has. As Astrid matures, she rejects her mother's views and manages to start her own life.The problem with this film was that it was so cut to ribbons in the editing room that nothing made sense. There is a character who appears for about 1/2 second in a flashback but what his purpose was is never made clear. Are we supposed to believe that Ingrid could possibly be innocent of the murder during some portion of the film ? How was the guy killed anyway ? I know that the book would have answered these questions, not because I read the book but because they kept talking about it in the 'commentary' track on the audio. The most frequent phrase on that track is ""We cut that out to make for a tighter story"" . I think they meant to make it a more confusing story and to remove the chance of the viewer developing any emotional attachment the characters.

734878,AKOWQ8J0TWZ1W,B000087F7A,An Amazon customer,"[6, 12]","I give this movie 3 stars mainly for the cast and their acting.  Where to begin with my complaints?Most of the realism, emotional power, and resonance of the book were watered down for a much more superficial film with a typical hokey Hollywood ending -- what that ending is I won't go into here.  If you've read the book you'll know what I mean; I'll just say that it's totally out of character for Ingrid.The film's characters of Ingrid and Claire, so well-drawn in the book that they seemed real, were pale shadows of their characters in the book.  Ingrid in the book was one of the most unique, unforgettable characters ever created, with probably the most distinctive personality and way of speaking of any character in any book I've ever read.  Very little of this was conveyed in the movie.  And as for Claire in the book, when she died I was nearly as devastated as was Astrid -- her character was so delicately and hauntingly delineated.  But once again, the movie version of this was not effective.  To sum it up: in the movie Ingrid was merely cold, ruthless, cynical, and intelligent, and Claire was merely sweet and fragile.  They were watered down and oversimplified from the book to the point that I know that time constraints weren't the issue here but sloppy screenwriting and/or editing.Key events and characters in the book were changed or completely left out.  It was a crime especially not to include Olivia, and Astrid's experiments with easy sex and drugs to numb her pain, but, oh, yes, the filmmakers were going for that all-important PG-13 rating.  And why do I get the feeling that casting blonde Renee Zellweger as (in the book) Audrey Hepburnish brunette Claire was done to service their gimmick of the four blondes for the movie posters.This movie is yet another example of an exquisite, nearly flawless book being butchered and sacrificed to the Hollywood marketing machine.  But the talented cast, particularly Allison Lohman, did the best they could with the shallow material they were left with by the movie's powers-that-be.",3,"Powerful book, defanged and diluted into a Lifetime movie",1096329600,"09 28, 2004",2004,2059,"['give', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'mainly', 'cast', 'acting', 'Where', 'begin', 'complaints', 'Most', 'realism', 'emotional', 'power', 'resonance', 'book', 'were', 'watered', 'down', 'much', 'more', 'superficial', 'film', 'typical', 'hokey', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'what', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'here', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'totally', 'character', 'Ingrid.The', 'film', 'characters', 'Ingrid', 'Claire', 'so', 'well-drawn', 'book', 'seemed', 'real', 'were', 'pale', 'shadows', 'characters', 'book', 'Ingrid', 'book', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'ever', 'created', 'probably', 'most', 'distinctive', 'personality', 'way', 'speaking', 'character', 'book', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'Very', 'little', 'was', 'conveyed', 'movie', 'Claire', 'book', 'when', 'died', 'was', 'nearly', 'as', 'devastated', 'was', 'Astrid', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'delicately', 'hauntingly', 'delineated', 'once', 'again', 'movie', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'effective', 'sum', 'up', 'movie', 'Ingrid', 'was', 'merely', 'cold', 'ruthless', 'cynical', 'intelligent', 'Claire', 'was', 'merely', 'sweet', 'fragile', 'were', 'watered', 'down', 'oversimplified', 'book', 'point', 'know', 'time', 'constraints', 'were', ""n't"", 'issue', 'here', 'sloppy', 'screenwriting', 'and/or', 'editing.Key', 'events', 'characters', 'book', 'were', 'changed', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'was', 'crime', 'especially', 'not', 'include', 'Olivia', 'Astrid', 'experiments', 'easy', 'sex', 'drugs', 'numb', 'pain', 'oh', 'yes', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'going', 'all-important', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'why', 'do', 'get', 'feeling', 'casting', 'blonde', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'book', 'Audrey', 'Hepburnish', 'brunette', 'Claire', 'was', 'done', 'service', 'gimmick', 'four', 'blondes', 'movie', 'posters.This', 'movie', 'yet', 'example', 'exquisite', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'book', 'being', 'butchered', 'sacrificed', 'Hollywood', 'marketing', 'machine', 'talented', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Allison', 'Lohman', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'shallow', 'material', 'were', 'left', 'movie', 'powers-that-be']",N/A
734879,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000087F7A,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","As good as a movie can be without ever hitting that emotional connection that a movie like this truly needs to survive, `White Oleander' tries very hard and gets a lot right; but that one thing hangs over its head like a dark cloud.The story told is that of young Astrid Magnussen.  Astrid lives under her mother's loving grasp, a love that is oddly selfish and misleadingly manipulative.  When her mother winds up committing murder and going to jail, Astrid is shuffled from one foster home to another.  While attempting to adapt to new surroundings, Astrid finds it harder and harder to connect with her new `mothers' and remotely find herself within their worlds.  She is at odds with their jealousy and lack of trust; and just when she thinks that maybe she could find a sense of happiness within one particular `mothers' eyes, it is shattered by the controlling force that is her mother.There are a slew of strong performances here; most notably that of Alison Lohman, Renee Zellweger and Michele Pfeiffer.  Pfeiffer is particularly strong here, maintaining a steely gaze that penetrates the soul and she wears her deceptive skin like a perfectly tailored suit.  You can add to the acting a slick direction and strong framing; each scene appearing in an almost milky residue, as if the scenes were being washed out.And yet, without that emotional burst, that connective tissue, the film becomes oddly forgettable.  Despite the actressing that is going on, and the efforts made to really internalize the emotions presented (especially Zellweger), the film cannot pick up on that spark and thus the impact of the film as a whole falls flat.Still, this is a film worth seeing once.",3,Fades to white...,1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,1683,"['As', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'ever', 'hitting', 'emotional', 'connection', 'movie', 'truly', 'survive', 'White', 'Oleander', 'tries', 'very', 'hard', 'lot', 'right', 'one', 'thing', 'over', 'head', 'dark', 'cloud.The', 'story', 'told', 'young', 'Astrid', 'Magnussen', 'Astrid', 'mother', 'loving', 'grasp', 'love', 'oddly', 'selfish', 'misleadingly', 'manipulative', 'When', 'mother', 'up', 'committing', 'murder', 'going', 'jail', 'Astrid', 'shuffled', 'one', 'foster', 'home', 'attempting', 'adapt', 'new', 'surroundings', 'Astrid', 'harder', 'harder', 'connect', 'new', 'mothers', 'remotely', 'find', 'worlds', 'odds', 'jealousy', 'lack', 'trust', 'just', 'when', 'maybe', 'could', 'find', 'sense', 'happiness', 'one', 'particular', 'mothers', 'eyes', 'shattered', 'controlling', 'force', 'are', 'slew', 'strong', 'performances', 'here', 'most', 'notably', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Michele', 'Pfeiffer', 'Pfeiffer', 'particularly', 'strong', 'here', 'maintaining', 'steely', 'gaze', 'soul', 'deceptive', 'skin', 'perfectly', 'tailored', 'suit', 'can', 'add', 'acting', 'slick', 'direction', 'strong', 'framing', 'scene', 'appearing', 'almost', 'milky', 'residue', 'scenes', 'were', 'being', 'washed', 'out.And', 'yet', 'emotional', 'burst', 'connective', 'tissue', 'film', 'oddly', 'forgettable', 'actressing', 'going', 'efforts', 'made', 'really', 'internalize', 'emotions', 'presented', 'especially', 'Zellweger', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'spark', 'thus', 'impact', 'film', 'whole', 'falls', 'flat.Still', 'film', 'seeing', 'once']",N/A

Without ever pandering to the lowest common denominator, director Kosminsky has used cast and screenplay to great advantage in this fascinating and complex tale.  Pfeiffer is in top form as a beautiful and brilliant narcissicistic woman capable of murder. And Alison Lohman is splendid as the daughter, Astrid, who has inherited her mother's beauty, talent and intelligence (but not her self-absorption) along with (however reluctantly) the more rational of her mother's life lessons.It is only with the greatest reluctance that children give up on their parents, even the worst of them. And it is particularly difficult to give up on someone who is beautiful; the child is forever searching for an inner beauty that will match up with the exterior. At the same time, Astrid is, via the foster care system, being offered to one new mother after another. Robin Wright Penn and Renee Zellweger both turn in solid, if uninspired, performances as two of them. Saving herself from potentially explosive situations by resorting to long-ago given advice from her mother, Astrid grows both into herself and away from her mother--ultimately demanding truth in exchange for the promise to tell lies in court that might see Pfeiffer released from prison.All the characters are fully developed, with the exception of Noah Wyle who is pretty much wasted in this film; he's got a fairly stock role with not much room for improvement--it's a part almost anyone could have played. Young Patrick Fugit fares better as Ingrid's friend and, later, as her partner. He manages to invest his role with an aura of hard-won wisdom, acceptance, and warmth.What is striking is the cinematography and an absence of filters except in certain key scenes. Zellweger, in particular, is shot in harsh, flat light that makes her appear visibly lacking, flawed somehow, as she is in fact. Pfeiffer is lit in an almost ethereal fashion that highlights the beauty that is so key to the narrative structure. Beautiful people can get away with all kinds of bad behavior, even with madness, but not, in this case, with murder. Her performance has a stillness that is unsettling--without doubt her best in a very long time. She and Lohman are entirely believable as mother and daughter and while Pfeiffer's character isn't as fully defined as it was in the novel, there is enough subtext there for the viewer to feel her arrogant, malign power.This is a very worthwhile film--primarily for its investigation of the always treacherous terrain of mother-daughter relationships.Highly recommended.",4,Much food for thought,1035504000,"10 25, 2002",2002,2666,"['Kudos', 'must', 'go', 'screenwriter', 'Mary', 'Agnes', 'Donogue', 'transforming', 'very', 'interior', 'book', 'intriguing', 'film', 'ever', 'pandering', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'director', 'Kosminsky', 'used', 'cast', 'screenplay', 'great', 'advantage', 'fascinating', 'complex', 'tale', 'Pfeiffer', 'top', 'form', 'beautiful', 'brilliant', 'narcissicistic', 'woman', 'capable', 'murder', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'splendid', 'daughter', 'Astrid', 'who', 'inherited', 'mother', 'beauty', 'talent', 'intelligence', 'not', 'self-absorption', 'however', 'reluctantly', 'more', 'rational', 'mother', 'life', 'lessons.It', 'only', 'greatest', 'reluctance', 'children', 'give', 'up', 'parents', 'even', 'worst', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'give', 'up', 'someone', 'who', 'beautiful', 'child', 'forever', 'searching', 'inner', 'beauty', 'will', 'match', 'up', 'exterior', 'same', 'time', 'Astrid', 'foster', 'care', 'system', 'being', 'offered', 'one', 'new', 'mother', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'turn', 'solid', 'uninspired', 'performances', 'two', 'Saving', 'potentially', 'explosive', 'situations', 'resorting', 'long-ago', 'given', 'advice', 'mother', 'Astrid', 'herself', 'away', 'mother', 'ultimately', 'demanding', 'truth', 'exchange', 'promise', 'tell', 'lies', 'court', 'might', 'see', 'Pfeiffer', 'released', 'characters', 'are', 'fully', 'developed', 'exception', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'wasted', 'film', 'got', 'fairly', 'stock', 'role', 'not', 'much', 'room', 'improvement', 'part', 'almost', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Young', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'better', 'Ingrid', 'friend', 'later', 'partner', 'invest', 'role', 'aura', 'hard-won', 'wisdom', 'acceptance', 'warmth.What', 'striking', 'cinematography', 'absence', 'filters', 'certain', 'key', 'scenes', 'Zellweger', 'particular', 'shot', 'harsh', 'flat', 'light', 'appear', 'visibly', 'lacking', 'flawed', 'somehow', 'fact', 'Pfeiffer', 'lit', 'almost', 'ethereal', 'fashion', 'beauty', 'so', 'key', 'narrative', 'structure', 'Beautiful', 'people', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'kinds', 'bad', 'behavior', 'even', 'madness', 'not', 'case', 'murder', 'performance', 'stillness', 'unsettling', 'doubt', 'best', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Lohman', 'are', 'entirely', 'believable', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Pfeiffer', 'character', ""n't"", 'fully', 'defined', 'was', 'novel', 'enough', 'subtext', 'viewer', 'feel', 'arrogant', 'malign', 'power.This', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'primarily', 'investigation', 'always', 'treacherous', 'terrain', 'mother-daughter', 'relationships.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Michelle Pfeiffer as Ingrid, at first glance, seems much too pristine and clean for her role here as a completely selfish ""artist"" who murders a lover... and in the end, her hatred for men exceeds her love for her young daughter (played by Alison Lohman in a star-turning role). Lohman as Astrid conveys the frustrations and disappointments of her life as she falls into state custody and later into the care of different foster families (all alarmingly inappropriate). First Astrid ends up with a sleazy born-again Christian (a dead-on performance from the multitalented Robin Wright Penn), who accuses Astrid of trying to seduce her boyfriend, when in fact it is the other way around); then Astrid ends up with a mentally unstable/suicidal housewife (Renee Zellweger), and later with a Russian immigrant. Certainly Astrid has seen enough trauma and has become an adult much too soon thanks to her mother, let alone from having to deal with the insanity these foster homes heap on her. Amazingly she keeps it together, emerging as the only seemingly balanced individual in the story. Lohman pulls off her role as the focal point of the film brilliantly, while the supporting roles are impressively executed.

Now the movie is out on DVD and in the home, without the disruption of an audience to distract, WHITE OLEANDER becomes a more sensitive exploration of the need of love between parent and child, or between each of us.  Part of the credibility of the film I found lacking in the book was the ability of the director and the actors to take the characters beyond caricature and targeted violence - whether that violence takes the form of mental or physical cruelty or is symptomatic of a social system that is in need of repair.  Alison Lohman gives a bravura performance as Astrid, the newly formed foster child after her mother's imprisonment for murder. Her mother, likewise, is fully fleshed out by Michelle Pfeiffer.  The foster parents may lack in social and parenting skills but the actors portraying them (Robin Wright Penn, Renee Zellweger, Zvetlana Efrenova, et al) find the core of credibility in each and are all supporting actors of the highest order.So here is an instance, at least for this reviewer, where the book was less than mediocre but provided a film that is memorable.

734904,A16VH7SPVPVJKV,B000087F7A,Harvey M. Canter,"[5, 6]","I think that this film both succeeded and failed--dedpending on if you read the book or not. If you did not read the book, you will probably find the film to be strong, carried along by the performances and the inherent human interest factor of the story. However, if you read the book, you will be aghast at how the film version utterly lacks the novel's poetry and depth. The film obscures, in fact, it almost entirely obliterates the foundational opening chapters where the mother commits the murder--and HOW she commits it--for that is the key metaphor of the text. (In the commentary track we learn that this was an ""artistic"" decision, and that the sequences were filmed but excised in favor of a focus on Astrid's journey). The intimate intricacy of Ingrid's murder of Barry, achieved by extracting the poison from the plant, then painting it on doorknobs, handles, etc around his house (with a chemical added to accelerate absorbtion through the skin) is Ingrid's basic M.O. Barry dies because Ingrid weakened and allowed him to ""touch"" her;when he betrays her vulnerability she infiltrates his home, his computer, and eventually poisons him vis-a-vis his ""touching"" of objects. Ingrid ""poisons"" the minds and souls of everyone around her--her daughter, Clare, her politcal supporters, the system. Her characterological disturbance is insidious and profound. The film portray Ingrid as being ""dangerous"", but she is more than that--she is POISONOUS. It is not THAT she kills, but HOW she kills that is essential.It is not that she ""manipulates"" others, but that she seeps her way into their souls, contaminating them from within. That the film is insensible to the ""poison"" metaphor fatally weakens its ability to exert the emotional impact of the book. The filmakers opt for the metaphor of the ""suitcases"" which tell the tale of Astrid's journey from home to home--a rather banal and concrete sort of imago, furtively depicted at the film's beginning and end. Wow--how profound. It is healing and meaningful that Astrid conceives this expression of her pain, loss, and triumph--it just is a limp metaphor upon which to hang an entire film. The DVD commentary tracks serve as evidence for a series of aesthetic crimes that are committed upon the book in the process of making the film. Ms. Lohman's performance as Astrid is both delicate and powerful, and carries the film. Michelle Pfieffer is overly strident, but then, the filmakers have left her as a hollow, one-note character due to the omission of her very nature from the script. Robin Wright-Penn is fabulous as Star, the alcoholic, not-quite born again trailer-trash ex-stripper who is Astrid's foster ""birth"" mother. Some of her best scenes are the ones that were ""deleted"" from the final cut, but which luckily survive as DVD ""extras"". (Although this is a ""chick flick"", guys will appreciate the scene in the dressing room, where Robin W-P unabashedly preens about in heels and undies--revealing a sculpted, sinuous frame that any real stripper would kill for). The film sort of tanks after Star attempts to ""cash Astrid's check"". The Rene Zellweger sequence is weakened by the film's rush to her pathetic death; she, too, is poisoned by Ingrid and by the coldness & infidelity of her husband, dispensed while on loan from ER. Patrick Fugit is on the mark as Paul. The later sequences of Astrid's hardening in the final foster home, and the long-awaited confrontation with Mommie Queerest are quite good, but the damage is done by then. Astrid's emancipation and triumph are tepidly achieved by virtue of her merely survivng the ordeal--rather than her being gradually purified and revived after the deep-tissue poisoning by Ingrid and the system. Maybe a Director's Cut, with all the excised and deleted scenes, could revivify this film. Unfortunately, listening to the commentary clearly indicates that what we see here IS the Director's Cut, so see this film ""as is"" and then go read the book for the full repast.",3,Poisonous Minds,1060819200,"08 14, 2003",2003,3987,"['think', 'film', 'succeeded', 'failed', 'dedpending', 'read', 'book', 'not', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'strong', 'carried', 'performances', 'inherent', 'human', 'interest', 'factor', 'story', 'However', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'aghast', 'how', 'film', 'version', 'utterly', 'novel', 'poetry', 'depth', 'film', 'obscures', 'fact', 'almost', 'entirely', 'foundational', 'opening', 'chapters', 'where', 'mother', 'murder', 'HOW', 'key', 'metaphor', 'text', 'commentary', 'track', 'learn', 'was', 'artistic', 'decision', 'sequences', 'were', 'filmed', 'excised', 'favor', 'focus', 'Astrid', 'journey', 'intimate', 'intricacy', 'Ingrid', 'murder', 'Barry', 'achieved', 'extracting', 'poison', 'plant', 'then', 'painting', 'doorknobs', 'handles', 'etc', 'house', 'chemical', 'added', 'accelerate', 'absorbtion', 'skin', 'Ingrid', 'basic', 'M.O', 'Barry', 'Ingrid', 'weakened', 'allowed', 'touch', 'when', 'vulnerability', 'home', 'computer', 'eventually', 'poisons', 'vis-a-vis', 'touching', 'objects', 'Ingrid', 'poisons', 'minds', 'souls', 'everyone', 'daughter', 'Clare', 'politcal', 'supporters', 'system', 'characterological', 'disturbance', 'insidious', 'profound', 'film', 'portray', 'Ingrid', 'being', 'dangerous', 'more', 'POISONOUS', 'not', 'HOW', 'essential.It', 'not', 'manipulates', 'others', 'seeps', 'way', 'souls', 'contaminating', 'film', 'insensible', 'poison', 'metaphor', 'fatally', 'ability', 'exert', 'emotional', 'impact', 'book', 'filmakers', 'opt', 'metaphor', 'suitcases', 'tell', 'tale', 'Astrid', 'journey', 'home', 'home', 'rather', 'banal', 'concrete', 'sort', 'imago', 'furtively', 'depicted', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'Wow', 'how', 'profound', 'healing', 'meaningful', 'Astrid', 'expression', 'pain', 'loss', 'triumph', 'just', 'limp', 'metaphor', 'hang', 'entire', 'film', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'serve', 'evidence', 'series', 'aesthetic', 'crimes', 'are', 'committed', 'book', 'process', 'making', 'film', 'Ms.', 'Lohman', 'performance', 'Astrid', 'delicate', 'powerful', 'film', 'Michelle', 'Pfieffer', 'overly', 'strident', 'then', 'filmakers', 'have', 'left', 'hollow', 'one-note', 'character', 'due', 'omission', 'very', 'nature', 'script', 'Robin', 'Wright-Penn', 'fabulous', 'Star', 'alcoholic', 'not-quite', 'born', 'again', 'trailer-trash', 'ex-stripper', 'who', 'Astrid', 'foster', 'birth', 'mother', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'ones', 'were', 'deleted', 'final', 'cut', 'luckily', 'survive', 'DVD', 'extras', 'chick', 'flick', 'guys', 'will', 'appreciate', 'scene', 'dressing', 'room', 'where', 'Robin', 'W-P', 'unabashedly', 'heels', 'undies', 'revealing', 'sculpted', 'sinuous', 'frame', 'real', 'stripper', 'would', 'kill', 'film', 'sort', 'tanks', 'Star', 'attempts', 'cash', 'Astrid', 'check', 'Rene', 'Zellweger', 'sequence', 'weakened', 'film', 'rush', 'pathetic', 'death', 'too', 'poisoned', 'Ingrid', 'coldness', 'infidelity', 'husband', 'dispensed', 'loan', 'ER', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'mark', 'Paul', 'later', 'sequences', 'Astrid', 'hardening', 'final', 'foster', 'home', 'long-awaited', 'confrontation', 'Mommie', 'Queerest', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'damage', 'done', 'then', 'Astrid', 'emancipation', 'triumph', 'are', 'tepidly', 'achieved', 'virtue', 'merely', 'survivng', 'ordeal', 'rather', 'being', 'gradually', 'purified', 'revived', 'deep-tissue', 'poisoning', 'Ingrid', 'system', 'Maybe', 'Director', 'Cut', 'excised', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'could', 'revivify', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'listening', 'commentary', 'clearly', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'Director', 'Cut', 'so', 'see', 'film', 'then', 'go', 'read', 'book', 'full', 'repast']",N/A

The girl knows all the horror there can be in the kind of institution she finds herself sent to or in the foster homes she ends up in. She is nothing but a substitute for something the foster parents do not have, or the dream that her presence is going to solve their own problems, or whatever. But the worst part is of course her mother who is, from behind the wings, pulling the strings that pretend to protect the girl whereas she is only treating her as a possession that has to be defended for future use. She thus more or less creates temptation or even death in those foster homes that could have helped her daughter. When this daughter finally realizes her mother's game it is by far too late and she can only sever the tie, the connection, the link, the bond. And it is then that she builds a compensation and pretends she finally understands that her mother loved her. When it becomes obvious the mother will not be granted an appeal or win the one she may be granted and that she will not be granted parole the daughter has to more or less make it sound as if she were responsible for her mother's crime, her mother's destitution and even her mother's continuing ordeal she deserves quite a lot.

Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing as Ingrid, an artist accused of murdering an acquaintance. While Ingrid is in jail, her daughter Astrid is shunted to a series of dysfunctional foster homes, which seem to scar her as much as the separation from her mom. But each home teaches her something, and (to the horror of her controlling Mom) allow her to grow away from the prescribed worldview that she had chosen for her daughter.Like the flower of the film's title, Ingrid is poison for whoever takes her in. Her eyes convey the narcissistic delight she takes in destroying people's lives and crushing their most heartfelt dreams. Escaping from the gravitational tug of people like this is an achievement -- exhausting and always dearly won.Alison Lohman did a reasonable job portraying Astrid from age 10-18. She caught the innocence of young Astrid splendidly, but was not convincing as her older incarnation.

734909,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B000087F7A,Joe Sherry,"[4, 5]","A film by Peter Kosminsky""White Oleander"" is the story of one girl's experience through the foster care system as she learns who she is, what she wants, and who she does not want to be.  This is the story of Astrid (Alison Lohman), a 15 year old girl who is living with her mother, Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer).  Ingrid is an ""artist"", with all of the pretensions that you can stereotype onto one character.  Ingrid believes the way she does and anyone who does not believe as she does (about anything) is being intellectually dishonest.  She encourages Astrid to think for herself, but it seems only if that means that Astrid's conclusions agree with Ingrid.  Things would probably stay as they are, but when Ingrid is arrested for murder, Astrid is put into foster care and the movie truly begins.Astrid spends relatively brief stays with several foster homes.  We see her at the home of Starr (Robin Wright Penn), a white trash born again Christian who speaks about Jesus an awful lot, but may not live like a Christian.  Problems arise, and Astrid is moved to the orphanage to another home, that of Claire (Renee Zellweger).  Claire is, to Astrid's view, the perfect foster mother.  But, like before, something happens and she is moved to another home, that of Rena (Svetlana Efremova).  Rena is an immigrant (from Russia?) and is entirely about making money.  Through each of the stays in a foster home, Astrid is blending her personality with that of the foster mother, trying to figure out who she is.  While this is happening, Astrid stays in touch with her mother and this is where we see the most growth for Astrid, in how she interacts with her mother.It is not fair to compare a movie with the book which it is based on because they are two entirely different forms of media, but sometimes a brief comparison needs to be mentioned.  The film is filled with talented actresses and they turn in fine performances, but the film is missing ""something"" that keeps it from being a truly excellent film.  The novel has a lot of emotional power that the film lacks (though there is one scene in particular that is very powerful, closer to the end of the film).  That power is part of the ""something"" that is missing.  There is nothing that is actually wrong with the film (despite some complaints with the ending), and it is competent, but it is simply not special at all.  Alison Lohman, on the other hand, is an actress to watch.",3,doesn't live up to the power of the book,1084233600,"05 11, 2004",2004,2433,"['film', 'Peter', 'Kosminsky', 'White', 'Oleander', 'story', 'one', 'girl', 'experience', 'foster', 'care', 'system', 'who', 'what', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'story', 'Astrid', 'Alison', 'Lohman', '15', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'living', 'mother', 'Ingrid', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Ingrid', 'artist', 'pretensions', 'can', 'stereotype', 'one', 'character', 'Ingrid', 'way', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'believe', 'anything', 'being', 'intellectually', 'dishonest', 'Astrid', 'think', 'only', 'Astrid', 'conclusions', 'agree', 'Ingrid', 'Things', 'would', 'probably', 'stay', 'are', 'when', 'Ingrid', 'arrested', 'murder', 'Astrid', 'put', 'foster', 'care', 'movie', 'truly', 'begins.Astrid', 'spends', 'relatively', 'brief', 'stays', 'several', 'foster', 'homes', 'see', 'home', 'Starr', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'white', 'trash', 'born', 'again', 'Christian', 'who', 'Jesus', 'awful', 'lot', 'may', 'not', 'live', 'Christian', 'Problems', 'arise', 'Astrid', 'moved', 'orphanage', 'home', 'Claire', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Claire', 'Astrid', 'view', 'perfect', 'foster', 'mother', 'before', 'something', 'happens', 'moved', 'home', 'Rena', 'Svetlana', 'Efremova', 'Rena', 'immigrant', 'Russia', 'entirely', 'making', 'money', 'stays', 'foster', 'home', 'Astrid', 'blending', 'personality', 'foster', 'mother', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'happening', 'Astrid', 'touch', 'mother', 'where', 'see', 'most', 'growth', 'Astrid', 'how', 'mother.It', 'not', 'fair', 'compare', 'movie', 'book', 'based', 'are', 'two', 'entirely', 'different', 'forms', 'media', 'sometimes', 'brief', 'comparison', 'needs', 'be', 'mentioned', 'film', 'filled', 'talented', 'actresses', 'turn', 'fine', 'performances', 'film', 'missing', 'something', 'being', 'truly', 'excellent', 'film', 'novel', 'lot', 'emotional', 'power', 'film', 'lacks', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'very', 'powerful', 'closer', 'end', 'film', 'power', 'part', 'something', 'missing', 'nothing', 'actually', 'wrong', 'film', 'complaints', 'ending', 'competent', 'simply', 'not', 'special', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'other', 'hand', 'actress', 'watch']",N/A

The film is amazing in its own way, too...amazingly shallow and trite.Alison Lohman stars as Astrid, the innocent young teen who is thrust into the foster care system when her shrew of a mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) is convicted of murder. Astrid is first sent to Starr (Robin Wright Penn), a trashy, Bible-thumping trailer tramp who ends up shooting Astrid. The next ""mother"" is Claire (Renee Zellweger), a needy, lonely actress. The last stop is a flea-market life of drugs and rock and roll. Astrid also stays at the county childrens home, where she meets Paul (Nick Fugit), a sensitive loner, artist, and soul-mate.The script sounded like a first draft, a summary, a roll-call of characters; it lacked any emotional depth or character development. The direction was simplistic. Apparently someone thought, ""What a great idea: Take some beautiful, famous actresses and put them together and make a feminist statement!"" In fact, the actresses are wasted in small, undeveloped parts, with the exception of Lohman, who carries the film. The three adult parts lack grit and fire; The film needed the mother's psychotic hatred and the utter selfishness and cruelty of the foster mothers that made the novel so unforgettable.

734915,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B000087F7A,Lawyeraau,"[3, 3]","This is a film adaptation of the best selling novel of the same name. I cannot say whether as an adaptation it is faithful to the book, not having read it, as yet. What I can say is that is  an excellent drama, marked by a breakout performance by Alison Lohman. She is positively inspiring  in the role of Astrid, a young, pre-pubescent girl of twelve whose life is torn apart when her mother, a beautiful, brilliant, and talented artist, is convicted of murder. The film chronicles Astrid's coming of age and the way that she deals with the vicissitudes of life, as she grows into a young woman. Ms. Lohman  plays Astrid from ages twelve through about twenty, as believable at twelve as she is at twenty, no easy transition to make. Yet, she does so brilliantly.The film is about a number of things. It is about exploration of the proverbial mother/daughter relationship. It is about the breaking of myths. It is about coping with tragedy and reality. It is about working with the hand with which one has been dealt in life. It is about love. It is about hate. It is about reconciliation. It is about redemption.Astrid and her mother, Ingrid, lead a materially comfortable life. Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a narcissistic,  successful  artist, with a cynical view on life who tries to inculcate and control her daughter with her own personal, unorthodox philosophy. Astrid, a sensitive, intelligent, and artistically gifted child, who is mature beyond her years, adores her mother, viewing her through rose colored glasses, even when Ingrid fails in meeting the most basic of parental responsibilities. Ingrid cheerfully chooses to go to an opening of a friend's gallery show rather than attend parents' night at her daughter's school. After all, as she explains to Astrid, what can the school tell her about her daughter that she does not already know?Astrid's feelings about Ingrid are put to the test, when her mother gives in to her violent passions and kills her lover. Convicted and sentenced to prison for many years, Ingrid is separated from Astrid, and Astrid's comfortable, though unorthodox, world is rendered asunder. Astrid would begin a long and painful, personal journey and a coming of age that would not be easy, as she attempts to reconcile the mother she thought she knew with the mother that she is just really starting to get to know. The mythic is now approaching reality.Astrid goes through a number of foster homes but each time that Ingrid senses that Astrid is getting attached to her foster mother or her foster family, Ingrid does what she can to poison the well, until she finally crosses the line. As Astrid grows up and starts to understand her mother's machinations, an emotional schism begins, one that is painful both to mother and daughter, with self-realization and reconciliation as outgrowths of their painful discovery.Michelle Pfeiffer is brilliant as the coldly diabolical Ingrid, a woman who would sacrifice her child's happiness in order to retain emotional control over that child.  She is as poisonous as the beautiful white oleander flower, whose appearance belies its deadly nature.  Robin Penn Wright is wonderful as Starr, Astrid's first foster mother, a born again Christian and former alcoholic exotic dancer with a heart of gold, who is looking to hang on to her man no matter what the cost. It is in her home that Astrid gets a reality check in the cruelest of ways. Removed from that home, Astrid is then sent to the home of Claire (Renee Zellweger) and her hunky husband (Noah Wylie). It is with Claire that Astrid begins to have a true mother/daughter relationship, provoking Ingrid's jealousy. Ingrid moves in for the kill, manipulating Claire's insecurities in order to separate Claire and Astrid.  What Ingrid does, however, has tragic consequences and serves to further alienate Astrid from her. Renee Zellweger gives a moving and sweetly poignant performance as the hapless Claire.When Astrid is also removed from this home, she ends up in an institution with other children with no place to go. There, she meets a young man (Patrick Fugit) who is also artistic and Astrid bonds with him. When Astrid talks to her mother about him and his art, Ingrid disparages him, trying to drive a wedge between Astrid and her young man. She succeeds somewhat, and Astrid cuts herself off from him and, in the process, from herself and from Ingrid. Refusing to opt for a traditional foster family when pushed to do so, no longer hopeful of making a loving, familial connection, she chooses, instead, to live with an unorthodox foster mother, a Russian immigrant (Zvetlana Efremova) and modern day Fagin. It is here that Astrid totally separates from herself and from her past, until a set of circumstances compel a confrontation with her mother. It is one in which Ingrid has an opportunity to make a decision that a real mother would make. It is also a decision that has the ability to make or break Astrid.This well nuanced film is superb, with phenomenal performances, but none more so that that of Alison Lohman. How she failed to receive an Academy Award nomination, I will never know. Kudos also go to director Peter Kosminsky for exacting wonderful and sensitive performances from the entire cast. The film also points out the problems with the foster care system. It shows how children are often placed with dysfunctional families. It delineates the often large gap between expectations and reality in terms of the parenting skills of the respective foster parents. The lack of knowledge of the quality of care the child is receiving, as well as its ignorance of the actual familial dynamics, is also brought home. This is an infinitely sad and somewhat depressing film, notwithstanding its overall excellence.",4,A STAR IS BORN...,1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,5769,"['film', 'adaptation', 'best', 'selling',

I have to give credit to Oprah's Book Club and my sister for introducing me to the novel by Janet Fitch. This is one of my favorite movies and a pretty good adaptation.Michelle Pfeiffer was exceptionally cold, intelligent, selfish, and beautiful - much like the Ingrid I'd pictured in the book. And Allison Lohman was phenomenal. Great supporting cast.I usually can't stand Renee Zellweger, but her last scenes were so powerful. An insecure, needy woman, too easily broken down by her husband.  He didn't know how to love her, as Astrid said.  He was not an authentic husband, someone you should be able to trust. Too often absent and removed from his wife's problems (which he trivialized). Claire had no faith in herself and could not see herself apart from her husband. And well, it didn't help that Ingrid pushed her a little over the edge. I hate it that Ingrid helped to destroy Astrid's happiest foster home.It made sense when Ingrid said that love humiliates but hatred cradles you. Love can make you very weak and stupid, as in Claire's case, while hatred made Ingrid a stronger woman.  She knew what she wanted, her art grew from this strength, and she was her own person. Claire was too damaged to survive as an entity separate from her husband. Some of Astrid's narration from the novel further illustrates:""I was tired of men.

Instead, it kept me intrigued at the rather interesting characters she met along the way and the clothes they all wore.  This was all told against the bright California sunshine.  I looked for some dark moments.  But, in spite of the tragedies that were written into the script, those dark moments just weren't there.Michelle Pfeiffer is cast as a possessive, yet loving mother.  Problem is she's doing 35 years in jail for murdering a boyfriend.  Alison Lehman is cast as her daughter.  She's all blonde and bright eyed and innocent and a pleasure to look at.  It was a good role and will probably further her acting career but she either needs more talent or a better director to make me feel the emotions that the part called for.  Renee Zellenger, looking uglier than I could ever imagine, was cast a foster mother with emotional needs of her own.  And Robin Wright Penn, looking trashy, was a foster mother who was jealous of her boyfriend's interest in the young girl.The acting was uniformly just all right and never got beyond the surface.  It wasn't boring, however, and the film held my interest throughout.  Not a bad timewaster, but not all films are destined for greatness.

She is a girl who looks up to her mother, the mother willing this, wanting to be looked up to, modeled after. The acting by Michelle Pfeiffer is extremely well done. I could sense her character's feelings without them being spoken. Astrid is on a search, a hard one to find herself. It is not a path she choose at least consciously but one that happened. She has many sad turnings but seems to pull herself out of them. I liked the ending and how she chose art as a way to express herself and to show her path of healing. I really liked the boxes that she created for each passage of time. I liked the way they looked so beautiful. I wanted to really look at them more closely to see what they held. I only made out parts of the treasures she had amassed. I also liked that she found a guy that seem to accept her for who she was. They both had gone through some terrible times and seemed to support one another. I also loved the food that Renee's character cooked. I wish I could get the energy to just put out that kind of food after a day of being on the beach and shopping. I liked the way the gyspy type foster mother collected things out of the trash and sold them for lots of money, how funny and creative. Of course, I wouldn't want to dig to deep in a bin, Yuck! I thought both Astrid and Ingrid were so pretty with long blond hair. How sad that beauty was seen as a weapon by Ingrid. She was very smart but destructive, unfortunate.

But, if a film is going to state, ""based on the novel"" it should be faithful to the tone and intentions of the novel at the very least.Janet Fitch's ""White Oleander"" is a sometimes bitter, very graphic, straightforward, hold no punches, indictment of the foster care system and of the all controlling, do as I say not as I do type of bitch/goddess motherhood as embodied by the character, Ingrid Magnussen. Fitch's ""Oleander"" was all sharp edges and exaggerated angles...melodramatic at times but beautifully written and ultimately painfully effective and redolent with pathos.The film of ""White Oleander"" as directed by Peter Kosminsky (who also directed the ill-conceived and casted 1992 ""Wuthering Heights"") is more geared for the masses and for that essential (?) in these times PG-13 rating. It's ""White Oleander/Lite"" as it were.All of Fitch's sharp edges and angles have been buffed smooth,butKosminsky has managed to assemble a dream cast that is, more to the point, extremely effective in their roles: Michelle Pfeiffer as Ingrid, Alison Lohman as her daughter, Astrid (a real find in what is basically the lead role), Robin Wright Penn as Starr and Renee Zelwegger as Claire.Pfeiffer, playing against type here, is a mass of negative vibes and wounded, exposed nerves: ""Love is fleeting, but Hatred envelops and soothes you"" (paraphrase). Alison Lohman is on the screen about 99% of the time and has to go up against, in difficult and dramatic scenes, the likes of Pfeiffer, Wright-Penn and Zelwegger. And she holds her own without any problem or hesitation. It would have been very interesting for Wright-Penn and Zelwegger to have exchanged roles: Zelwegger as the slattern Starr and Wright Penn as the sensitive, suicidal Claire. But as it stands both do good work here.""White Oleander"" feels stunted and chopped up; as if the film has been over-edited: some scenes feel like they are stopped short before they have a chance to ""play-out"" as originally shot. The scenes with Astrid's last foster family rushes by and has no dramatic worth or weight. Couldn't these scenes have been cut out completely thereby allowing all that precede them to breath and live more effectively?""White Oleander"" has some major flaws but casting is definitely not one of them. Kosminsky has succeeded in directing a wonderful cast in what is basically a good film of an excellent novel.

I loved that it had a primarily all female cast and the dynamics portrayed between the women.  The acting was also high quality.  Michelle Pfieffer was very believable as a beautiful, self-centered, vindictive, manipulative woman who also lived by stoic, altruistic ideals and wanted the same for her daughter. She abhored weakness and vulnerability.  Her parenting definitely wasn't based on nurturing, safety, or security. The issue with foster homes was also interesting. While disasterous and shocking more so because of the characters, the foster system portrayed in the movie wasn't very credible. What was more believable, was how Allison Lohman's character, Astrid, was transformed by each of her experiences as she is shuffled through the system. I was skeptical that the foster system would even allow some of the individuals portrayed in the movie to be foster parents.

734926,A3DE9GQDO6O6D1,B000087F7A,"Nancy R. Katz ""NancyK18""","[28, 31]","White Oleander, featuring Michelle Pfeiffer and Alison Lohman, is the movie based on the book by Janet Fitch.  Viewers of the Oprah Winfrey daytime television show and readers will recall that this book was one of Oprah&#65533;s book club selections.  Now this compelling and disturbing book has been brought to the silver screen in what many viewers will agree was an intriguing and well-crafted movie.  And rarely, if ever in my opinion, has a movie been so finely done or as faithful to the book as was done in this movie.  In addition the cast was well chosen and the performances are creatively superb, handling a most difficult subject.Michelle Pfeiffer, in the lead role, plays Ingrid Magnusson, a single parent and artist who is raising her adolescent daughter Astrid played by Alison Lohman.  Ingrid is an incredibly selfish woman with a Bohemian lifestyle who treats Astrid more like a friend than her child.  While Ingrid&#65533;s life is dictated by her passions and whims, Astrid is merely a bystander to the lifestyle Ingrid dictates for them.  When she is angered by the rejection of her current lover and while Astrid sits in their car, Ingrid poisons her lover with the inner juice of a white oleander plant ultimately killing this man.  When Ingrid is arrested by the police, Astrid is removed from their home by social services and becomes a ward of the state.  Now the focus of the movie shifts from Astrid as Ingrid&#65533;s daughter and work in progress to Astrid, a child who will become much too familiar with the foster care system in Southern California.  Unfortunately for Astrid, the foster homes she stays in are less than happy situations for her and she also must contend with Ingrid&#65533;s views of her foster mothers as she goes from home to home, learning more about the seamier side of life than any child should have to learn at this pivotal time in her life.  And all the while Astrid remains loyal to Ingrid as she continues to be subjected to her when she visits Ingrid in prison.This is a movie populated mainly by an all female cast.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays Ingrid with a mixture of anger and compassion about her situation and Astrid&#65533;s circumstances.  And both Renee Zellwegger and Robin Wright Penn shine as two very different types of foster mothers who greatly influence Astrid&#65533;s life.  But if the movie belongs to one actor it is Astrid played by Alison Lohman who shines as the confused young woman forced to face life as an adult way before her time.

Both are based on novels about a traumatized teenage girl who overcomes mega-adversity; heroines who get stronger as the story progresses. Both are told entirely from the point-of- view of this central character; Melinda (Kristen Stewart) in ""Speak"" and Astrid (Alison Lohman) in ""White Oleander"". Both actresses are physically small and the directors in each film effectively utilize this to reinforce their vulnerability.And each Cinematographer gets maximum effect from the camera as both films are filled with tight shots of the heroine's face. Like Stewart, Lohman gives an incredible non-verbal performance, which is nicely offset by her voice-over narration. Astrid's flat and distanced narration is often contradicted by the crushing emotional trauma she is experiencing on the screen, this dichotomy is a very effective way to illustrate her inner strength and multi- dimensionality.""White Oleander's"" strength is the way it soft-peddles the overwrought melodrama by skimping on the ""Mommie Dearest"" moments. Instead of a focus on the relationship between an imprisoned mother (Ingrid-played Michelle Pfeiffer) and her abandoned daughter, the film is about Astrid's journeys; her physical travels around the Los Angeles area to different foster care situations and her internal journey from dependency to independence.Mother and daughter are both artists (although Astrid is also an observer) and the director symbolically incorporates color into the story. White is ""Ingrid's color and Astrid's eventual independence occurs when she adopts black as her color late in the film. When she finally comes to terms with how much of her mother is in her, she returns to white.The blondes are out in force as Robin Wright Penn and Renee Zellweger play two of Astrid's foster mothers. All three supporting performances are excellent. Pfeiffer plays a humorless version of her ""I Could Never Be Your Woman"" mother; a mix of ascetically refined artist and imperious sociopath. Lohman has all of Pfeiffer's delicate beauty so the mother-daughter connection requires no suspension of disbelief.Astrid's foster kid desperation for family leads her to adopt the characteristics of her caretakers, adopting religion while with born-again ex-stripper Starr (Wright Penn) and yuppie indulgence while with depressed actress Claire (Zellweger). There's a tragic quality to Claire that is unlike anything Zellweger has done before. She is the anathema of Astrid's chilly, threatened mother.This is a film where the make-up and hair people earned their pay as Astrid's adaptation and life changes are underscored with very effective changes in her physical appearance.As in ""Speak"" flashbacks are effectively used at points throughout the story.The DVD special features commentary is about as good as it gets.  The author Janet Fitch is featured along with Director Peter Kosminsky and Producer John Wells.  Fitch seems quite pleased with the adaptation of her novel and seems to get it that a modest budget feature film can only focus on a portion of her original story.Then again, what do I know?

734933,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000087F7A,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[9, 11]","In an ideal world, one imagines humans being free to love and never feeling rejected or having to reject. A world where loneliness doesn't exist and people open their hearts to allow love to flow freely through the world.Perhaps as human beings we can never reach this higher plane of existence since we struggle so much with the idea of unconditional love. Love is at times taken away at the first instance of another's rejection. To give love at times means to accept hurt or to be hurt by those you try to love in an unconditional way.This movie really captured my attention from beginning to end. You can feel everything the characters experience. That is so rare these days. You can feel the hate, the love, the fear, the loneliness, the rejection, the acceptance.There is an element of dark beauty in this sometimes emotionally intense drama adapted from Janet Fitch's bestseller (an Oprah's Book Club selection).There are elements in this movie which seem to be mocking religious beliefs, however if you look deeply into the movie and see the true meaning, what I think the movie is saying is: ""It is more important to live out your beliefs and do good to others, than to say you believe in God/Jesus and then to treat others with disrespect."" Or at least the main message is that you should live what you believe.At first, I thought this was going to be another ""bash religion"" movie, and I was pleasantly surprised at the end.Some of the main themes include the concepts of loneliness and making mistakes. Astrid Magnussen (Alison Lohman who is a great actress and I can't wait to see her in other films) is not only looking for a father figure in her life, she has had to deal with a less-than-perfect foster care system where she becomes ""Nobody's"" child. This is a world where more than 450,000 children are living in a foster care situation. She is a victim of her own desire to be loved by a father and sees loving older men (her foster ""father"") as a way to obtain love. She is therefore the victim of sexual abuse.Astrid's mother, Ingrid Magnussen (Michelle Pfeiffer), rejects religion and believes her daughter must fight the urge to accept love because she feels loneliness. She thinks to survive, you must fight and destroy. So, when the man in her life cheats on her, she kills him with the poison of oleander flowers in a fit of jealousy. She destroys not only her life, but her daughters life.Once her mother is in prison, Astrid must struggle to survive in various Los Angeles foster homes. She encounters a ""not so"" born-again Christian (not exactly an example of Christ shall we say), a suicidal housewife and a Russian business woman. Only the housewife really seems to give Astrid what she longs for: ""A mother who cares about her and shows her the meaning of love.""But as the story unfolds, we see that time and time again, it is the men in this story who seem to be making the lives of the women more difficult. When the housewife (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) has to chose between keeping Astrid or sending her back to save her marriage, she hurts more people than just herself to keep a man who she has already lost.Not only does Astrid have to live in these disharmonious households, she is the victim her own beauty and seems to be living in a world where women hate her.At a young age, she has to deal with neglect, desertion and brutality. All she wants to find is acceptance, self-worth, a sense of security and love.Throughout the time her mother is in prison, they write letters to each other. Astrid must decide if she will follow her mother's advice or the deepest desires of her heart.A poetic start, a tragic story about the loneliness of the human condition and a great ending. This is about survival and about finding love.

At that point, you realize that she's only happy for her Astrid when her life is getting flushed down the toilet.

That way, she (in her mind) will always feel good about herself.  It's how she got her kicks.  In any case, her daughter (at that point) decided to finally cut her mother out of her life, which, towards the end of the movie, is key in Astrid finally getting to find the hapiness she's been looking for all her life.Also, Ingrid is shown to be somebody who thinks that the world revolves around her, and that doing anything to keep this delusional reality she has is justified, even if it includes murder.

And in this movie most of it does for the young girl who looses her mother to the penal system and becomes a victim of the foster care system herself.Pretty, talented, sensitive, questioning, aware. And now alone. She bounces from misery to crisis for 3 years while fighting her mother in order to define herself and learn who she is. Its a good story, well written, sensitively filmed and a real treat. If you watch the DVD watch the director's conversation after the movie so it will answer a few questions left on the cutting room floor that would have helped a bit with the continuity.

734936,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000087F7A,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 7]","White Oleander (Peter Kosminsky, 2002)When a veteran director of awful TV movies helms the moving adaptation of an Oprah novel, the average viewer should probably be prepared for the worst. And from that point of view, this film is quite the pleasant surprise. It certainly beats the pants off other painfully bad Oprah-novel adaptations like The Deep End of the Ocean.Kosminsky (whose only other big-screen appearance was an ill-thought-out but well-cast adaptation of Wuthering Heights a decade before this&#65533;remember that description, as it will become relevant here in a few minutes) and scriptwriter Mary Agnes Donoghue (Beaches, Deceived) take Janet Fitch&#65533;s dysfunction-junction novel and pare out a good deal of the character development, leaving lots of action and a tale that centers more fully on the character of Astrid Magnusson (Alison Lohman, here doing her best Karen Carpenter impersonation). Problem is, while it&#65533;s nice to have a strong central character, what they got rid of was in some places central to understanding what was going on in the film (for example, the sequence of events that land Astrid&#65533;s mother Ingrid [Michelle Pfeiffer] in prison at the beginning of the film, which makes no sense to folks who haven&#65533;t read the book).Balancing out the plot holes and jerking around is a set of exceptionally well-drawn characters. Lohman and Pfeiffer both carry their roles quite well, and are backed up with an excellent supporting cast. Special mention should go to Renee Zellweger, who turns in the best job to date in her career, and Patrick Fugit (all gorwn up and not recognizable as the same annoying kid who got such a welcome comeuppance in the godawful TV movie Marabunta! a few years ago), Astrid&#65533;s best pal and on-again off-again lover (whoops, they cut tat bit out of the movie. too&#65533;). Cole Hauser also turns in a fine performance, as he usually does; his role is cut down to the absolute basics, and is one of the places where the movie would have benefited from being a good half-hour or so longer.All in all, it&#65533;s a reprise of last year&#65533;s In the Bedroom; some fine performances of some well-written characters in the midst of a script that never quite comes together. ***",3,"In the Bedroom, redux",1036713600,"11 8, 2002",2002,2269,"['White', 'Oleander', 'Peter', 'Kosminsky', '2002', 'When', 'veteran', 'director', 'awful', 'TV', 'movies', 'helms', 'moving', 'adaptation', 'Oprah', 'novel', 'average', 'viewer', 'should', 'probably', 'be', 'prepared', 'worst', 'point', 'view', 'film', 'quite', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'certainly', 'pants', 'other', 'painfully', 'bad', 'Oprah-novel', 'adaptations', 'Deep', 'End', 'Ocean.Kosminsky', 'only', 'other', 'big-screen', 'appearance', 'was', 'ill-thought-out', 'well-cast', 'adaptation', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'decade', '65533', 'remember', 'description', 'will', 'become', 'relevant', 'here', 'few', 'minutes', 'scriptwriter', 'Mary', 'Agnes', 'Donoghue', 'Beaches', 'Deceived', 'take', 'Janet', 'Fitch', '65533', 's', 'dysfunction-junction', 'novel', 'pare', 'good', 'deal', 'character', 'development', 'leaving', 'lots', 'action', 'tale', 'more', 'fully', 'character', 'Astrid', 'Magnusson', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'here', 'doing', 'best', 'Karen', 'Carpenter', 'impersonation', 'Problem', '65533', 's', 'nice', 'have', 'strong', 'central', 'character', 'what', 'got', 'rid', 'was', 'places', 'central', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'film', 'example', 'sequence', 'events', 'land', 'Astrid', '65533', 's', 'mother', 'Ingrid', '[', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', ']', 'prison', 'beginning', 'film', 'sense', 'folks', 'who', 'haven', '65533', 't', 'read', 'book', '.Balancing', 'out', 'plot', 'holes', 'jerking', 'around', 'set', 'exceptionally', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'Lohman', 'Pfeiffer', 'carry', 'roles', 'quite', 'well', 'are', 'backed', 'up', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Special', 'mention', 'should', 'go', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'who', 'best', 'job', 'date', 'career', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'gorwn', 'up', 'not', 'recognizable', 'same', 'annoying', 'kid', 'who', 'got', 'welcome', 'comeuppance', 'godawful', 'TV', 'movie', 'Marabunta', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Astrid', '65533', 's', 'best', 'pal', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'lover', 'whoops', 'cut', 'tat', 'bit', 'movie', 'too', '65533', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'also', 'fine', 'performance', 'usually', 'role', 'cut', 'down', 'absolute', 'basics', 'one', 'places', 'where', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'being', 'good', 'half-hour', 'so', 'longer.All', '65533', 's', 'reprise', 'last', 'year', '65533', 's', 'Bedroom', 'fine', 'performances', 'well-written', 'characters', 'midst', 'script', 'never', 'quite', 'together', '***']",N/A
734937,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000087F7A,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 0]","This is an absolutely first rate film, of a girl who must overcome a childhood with a manipulative, crazy, destructive single mother.  The cast is simply stunning:  Wright Penn, Zellweger, and Pfeiffer in perhaps her greatest performance.The situation is that an adolescent, when her mother goes to prison, must go into the foster care system.  What she experiences, as is the stuff of narratives, is truly horrible.  Any time that she builds a relationship, it is destroyed or revealed as worthless.  Throughout all of this, she begins to see her birth mother for what she is, and seeks to go her own way.But her mother, even from prison, can control events by the relationships she can create.  All over again, it is like a recapitulation of the daughter's entire life, which spurs her to seek the truth even at the cost of traducing her inner self.  They have a terrible fight, played almost entirely off stage but understood in moments of simple dialogue, that is the fight for the girl's life itself.Alison Lohman, as the daughter, is simply extraordinary.  There is not a moment that rings false or hollywood-chinsey, but her pain and struggle is achingly real.  Of course, the character has some talent, as an artist like her mother, but also in her ability to form relationships.  She has seen so much pain and self-destruction, that she learns she must fend for herself.  I do not think I have ever seen a film that succeeds so completely as a coming of age drama of finding a path through the pain.  She becomes tough, but she does not lose the perceptive sensitive core that might show her a way to become a healthy, loving adult.  It is amazing to watch and there is not a jot of sentimentality, only realistic tragedy and growth for what it is worth.Warmly recommended.  This is a moving journey that says so much about what youth must survive through our pathetically damaged social system and deficient public policy.  Lohman is amazing and so are the other stars.

734939,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000087F7A,Roland E. Zwick,"[10, 13]","Based on the best-selling novel by Janet Fitch, ""White Oleander"" provides a fascinating portrait of a heartbroken, wounded soul trying, against seemingly insurmountable odds, to overcome the many adversities fate seems determined to throw in her way.  Astrid Magnussen is a hopeful, loving, all around ""good kid"" who just happens to be surrounded by a world full of hurting, dysfunctional adults.  And none fits that description more than her very own mother, a beautiful and successful photographer who is sentenced to 35 years in prison after she poisons her unfaithful boyfriend (with the white oleander that gives the film its title).  Left to the equally dysfunctional foster care system, Astrid is sent to live with one troubled ""family"" after another while her mother, fearing she will lose her hold on Astrid, seeks for ways to sabotage her daughter's happiness from behind bars.Much of the criticism leveled against this film has revolved around the perceived episodic nature of the screenplay.  The charge seems to be that, just as we are becoming interested in a particular milieu or set of characters, the story drops them and moves on to a new place and a new group of people.  I couldn't disagree more.  If anything, the freeform looseness of the script lends the film an air of greater believability, a more lifelike quality than it would otherwise have had had the story been more conventionally ""plotted out.""  The use of such a structure shows that the storytellers are far more concerned with exploring the characters than with merely delivering a neatly tied-up and packaged narrative. This is fully Astrid's story, and the ""episodic nature"" of the tale brings to it the quality of an epic journey, as we join this one young woman in her search for love and meaning in a world tragically devoid of both those qualities.  As Astrid, Alison Lohman delivers one of the outstanding performances of recent years, a true career breakthrough for this talented actress.  She has been asked to do nothing less than carry this entire film - she is never off screen for a moment - and she proves herself more than equal to the task.  Her luminous face functions as a sort of beacon, lighting our way through the labyrinth of her character's life.  In her every move and gesture, Lohman embodies the hurt and confusion that define the character - yet through it all she allows us to sense the innate goodness and hope for something better that keep the protagonist from becoming just another passive victim of circumstances beyond her control.The film also does a fine job with the character of Astrid's mother.  The screenplay by Mary Agnes Donoghue does not find it necessary to ""explain"" Ingrid in rationalistic terms.  Indeed, Ingrid remains pretty much an enigma from beginning to end.  By not spelling out what exactly the demons are that drive this woman - if they are indeed demons at all - the film heightens the sense of moral imbalance so essential to Astrid's story.  Astrid can't understand her mother, and neither can we.  Is she mentally ill?  Is she inherently ""evil""?  Such questions are never answered - and neither should they be, for answers to such questions would violate the morally ambiguous spirit of the world these characters inhabit.  Like the white oleander of the film's title, Ingrid embodies that quality of ""deadly beauty"" that so often defines the evil we encounter in this life - and against which we seem to have so few defenses.Director Peter Kosminsky employs a number of impressive techniques to help draw the viewer into the story.  By remaining so obsessively focused on the face of Astrid, he allows us to identify fully with all she is going through.  He also gives the film an offbeat, otherworldly quality by making such naturalistic elements as the wind, the ocean and the nighttime sky key players in the drama.  They provide a strong impressionistic background for the story's action, helping to create a world whose moral terrain is at times very unreal and very disturbing.  Thomas Newman's haunting score aids immeasurably in this respect.If for no other reason, ""White Oleander"" deserves to be seen for its uniformly outstanding performances.  In addition to the brilliant Ms. Lohman, we have Michelle Pfieffer giving what may be the performance of her career in this (for her) atypical portrait of a sinister woman.  She makes us feel both disgust and pity for this lost soul who for whatever reason is clearly unable to provide the proper moral guidance for the daughter she so obviously loves.  Renee Zellweger brings warmth and just the right touch of vulnerability to her portrait of the foster mother with whom Astrid forges a strong, caring relationship.  Cole Hauser is excellent as the handsome older guardian who seduces Astrid and helps to precipitate a family crisis in the process.  And Robin Wright Penn and Patrick Fugit round out this nigh unto flawless cast.If you appreciate movies that have the courage to wander off the beaten path and to map out a course all their own, ""White Oleander"" should most assuredly fit the bill.  And based on her work here, Alison Lohman seems destined for greatness.",4,Great Performances in a Powerful Film,1034985600,"10 19, 2002",2002,5176,"['Based', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'Janet',

Though after seeing the movie I may do so.The movie is the story of Astrid, fifteen years old, after her narcisstic and cruel mother goes to jail for murdering her boyfriend.  Astrid is then sent to foster care where she lives first with a trashy bible-thumper woman who ends up shooting Astrid after becoming jealous of Astrid's relationship with the woman's boyfriend, then in a juvenile center where she is attacked, then with a woman loves Astrid but ends up committing suicide over her cheating husband (an action taken at the encouragement of Astrid's jailed mother), then back to the juvenile center, finally to a Russian woman's home teaches Astrid, if not morality, to take care of herself.  It's a bumpy ride that Astrid struggles to try growing up in.I enjoyed the movie quite a lot.  The actors are all excellent.  The movie is moody in the extreme.  The use of light and dark, the seemingly normal that is abnormal, and shifting camera angles really draw the viewer into the story.The story does a lot to demonstrate the horrors of foster care, the difficulty faced by attractive girls, and the idiocy of the juvenile care systems.  Shown, too, is how real the mental/emotional abuse is that a parent can heap upon their child, without ever touching them physically.Where I think this movie went wrong is right at the end.  When the mother 'does the right thing' and allows Astrid to get on with her life, I felt that was a totally cowardly ending.  This character was a cruel woman who would never, in a million years, sacarficed her freedom from jail in order to help her daughter.

734948,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,B000087F7A,Thayer,"[5, 6]","I've read the book and I must say I prefer the film version because the characters here were more three dimensional especially Michelle Pfeiffer's character. Her character is not the most realistic thing ever but towards the end the film version humanized her that totally changed the vibe of the character, it's different from the book but I think it works better. .It's  the story of Astrid (Alison Lohman) who had the worst luck in terms of foster homes as she transfers from one messed up foster parents to another, after her mom Ingrid (Pfeiffer) murdered her boyfriend. Most of the memorable scenes are the ones where Astrid and Ingrid are together. Michelle Pfeiffer gave one of her best performances in a kind of role she's so adept at playing (think of a poetic Catwoman or Suzie Diamond)  In a climactic final confrontation with her daughter she's got to be evil, moving and vulnerable all at same time. She's really great.But the whole ensemble was actually good. Renee Zellweger gave a very affectionate performance, the vulnerability she showed especially when Ingrid was verbally attacking her was just heartbreaking (""she must be a great comfort to you not being able to have children of your own""). Lohman carried the role with such natural understatement and believability and carried the whole film with tenderness, she's an important aspect of the film since she's in every scene of the movie .The whole flow of the movie is great, it's like a subtle breeze as she embarks chapter by chapter, it's stylish enough for my taste. I guess this is also the type of movie that should've been longer to improve the movie. It has a classy atmosphere compared to other dramas. I guess the weakness of the movie is that since there are too many characters, not all of them were given the chance to fully develop, The ending was good, the final gaze between Pfeiffer (who by the way just became the prettiest criminal in the world) and Lohman speaks it all.Grade: A-",5,Ingrid Magnussen: Beautiful but Deadly,1098748800,"10 26, 2004",2004,1974,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'must', 'say', 'prefer', 'film', 'version', 'characters', 'here', 'were', 'more', 'three', 'dimensional', 'especially', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'character', 'character', 'not', 'most', 'realistic', 'thing', 'ever', 'end', 'film', 'version', 'humanized', 'totally', 'changed', 'vibe', 'character', 'different', 'book', 'think', 'better', '.It', 'story', 'Astrid', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'who', 'had', 'worst', 'luck', 'terms', 'foster', 'homes', 'one', 'messed', 'up', 'foster', 'parents', 'mom', 'Ingrid', 'Pfeiffer', 'murdered', 'boyfriend', 'Most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'are', 'ones', 'where', 'Astrid', 'Ingrid', 'are', 'together', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'gave', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'kind', 'role', 'so', 'adept', 'playing', 'think', 'poetic', 'Catwoman', 'Suzie', 'Diamond', 'climactic', 'final', 'confrontation', 'daughter', 'got', 'be', 'evil', 'moving', 'vulnerable', 'same', 'time', 'really', 'great.But', 'whole', 'ensemble', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'gave', 'very', 'affectionate', 'performance', 'vulnerability', 'showed', 'especially', 'when', 'Ingrid', 'was', 'verbally', 'attacking', 'was', 'just', 'heartbreaking', 'must', 'be', 'great', 'comfort', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'have', 'children', 'own', 'Lohman', 'carried', 'role', 'such', 'natural', 'understatement', 'believability', 'carried', 'whole', 'film', 'tenderness', 'important', 'aspect', 'film', 'scene', 'movie', '.The', 'whole', 'flow', 'movie', 'great', 'subtle', 'breeze', 'chapter', 'chapter', 'stylish', 'enough', 'taste', 'guess', 'also', 'type', 'movie', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'longer', 'improve', 'movie', 'classy', 'atmosphere', 'compared', 'other', 'dramas', 'guess', 'weakness', 'movie', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'not', 'were', 'given', 'chance', 'fully', 'develop', 'ending', 'was', 'good', 'final', 'gaze', 'Pfeiffer', 'who', 'way', 'just', 'became', 'prettiest', 'criminal', 'world', 'Lohman', 'all.Grade', 'A-']",N/A

734952,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B000087F7A,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[1, 1]","This movie was the highlight of my year.  First of all, it made me realize some things about movie critics.  A critic from one of my favorite pop culture magazines shrugged it off, claiming he was getting an ""estrogen overload.""  I am highly dissappointed that people aren't looking at this film as its own, but they are looking at it as an adaptation or ""just another chick flick.""  I must address the important issue that this is not a redundant film, it is unique.  And everyone needs to realize that adapted screenplays always have to be different in some way from the previous material that was used.  For instance, the book of the same name used the white oleander as a metaphor, but the movie makers chose to use suitcases as a metaphor instead, probably because it's an easier thing to work with.  No one seems to realize this.  It made me sad that one of my favorite movies was so badly recieved just because of two innane reasons.The synopsis is as follows: The movie starts out with Astrid (Alison Lohman) and Ingrid (Michelle Pheiffer) Magnussen, both artists (the former a painter and the latter a photographer) who try to see the world in an independent way.  Unfortunately, Astrid is not allowed to see or live in the world as herself, but as her mother.  Her mother is much like an oleander: Beautiful on the outside but poisinous on the inside.  She has already ""rubbed off"" on Astrid.  And when Ingrid murders her womanizing boyfriend and is sent to prison, Astrid is finally set free, but only physically.  Throughout the movie, she goes from foster house to foster house.  First is the former-stripper, trailer trash, Christian woman Starr (Robin Wright-Penn).  Second is the beautiful and loving Claire (Renee Zellwegger) who holds a dark secret.  And the last is a Russian woman (played by an unknown actress) who only loves money.  In between these experiences, she is put in the infamous McKinnly Hall, where she meets another artist, Paul.  The movie is ultimately about how all of these different homes and people influence her behavior and how she finds her self seperate from her mother.  It is, truly, a powerfull story.The best thing about this movie was the acting.  Michelle Pheiffer and Alison Lohmon were the best, along with Robin Wright-Penn.  Renee Zellwegger was also great, but had the easiest role in the cast.  I believe that Pheiffer and Lohman were both robbed of Oscar Nominations, with Queen Latifah and Renee Zellwegger in place of them.  But fortunately, Allison Lohman will be appearing in two movies this fall, one of which is the movie Big Fish which is apparantly Oscar-bound.  Watch out for her.  She is destined to be one of the great actresses of our time.Another key part of this film is the haunting score.  The music constantly makes you shiver with curiosity and wonder.  It really is an achievement in its own right.  What I also noticed were the colors.  At Ingrid's home, it was almost completely blank, relying on Ingrid's collages to decorate the walls.  I believe this represents her influence.  Everything in Starr's home seemed to be pretentious and fake.  Nothing seemed real, much like Starr, who tries to be something that she is not.  And Claire's home is a constant white that I think means comfort in Astrid's eyes.  And at the Russian woman's home, everything is black and crimson, representing her drastic change and dangerous enviroment.  Also pay attention to how the movie is filmed.  The commentary stated it is mostly filmed with handheld, giving this movie a wonderful sense of reality.Bottom Line: This movie was highly underappreciated and I believe that if you view it from a non-biased standpoint you will fall in love with every element of this film.

Astrid moves from foster home to foster home and this is very heartbreaking to watch, but is rather one-sided.  In each case, it seems that the foster parents have problems, which in reality is fairly rare.Excellent performances from the actress who plays Astrid, and a surprisingly good one from Renee Zellweger on a more dramatic level.
