The movie started off okay, pacing was good, direction, cinematography, etc was fine and I liked the awkwardness of the film (film had a ""realness"" to it that most films like this just lack.  You had a feeling of how the film was going to proceed and it was okay up until the first 60 minutes.  Then the film just took a really dark turn that didn't quite match the tone of the first 60 minutes.  And then they do something pretty bad with one of the likable characters and they basically burn the bond between the main character and us-- the viewer.  So now, you are watching a movie for which you hate all the characters.  And the only thing worse than the change in the movie and direction is the ending.  Seriously, WTF?This movie could have been a solid B+ movie but it just completely botched the last 20 minutes of the film.

But don't go in expecting plot and character development!",3,UGH,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,170,"['Amusing', 'oft-funny', 'rather', 'off-beat', 'like', 'campy', 'zombie/vampire', 'horror', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'uup', 'alley', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'plot', 'character', 'development']",Revenant
1496168,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005NVMK7W,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Revenant is a mix of comedy and horror (but mainly comedy).  Hey, even if the writers *tried* to combine comedy with horror, by default the comedy would win out and overtake the horror.  This is the case almost every single time because the moment we realize a film is written for the purpose of laughs and jokes, that removes *all* potential horror elements immediately.  A lot of times movies are NOT able to succeed in attempting to combine both drastically different genres, but this film is perhaps a major exception.Anyway the Revenant is about two friends that ultimately become vampires.  Actually the first half of the film is about one friend coming back to life despite the other one attending his funeral.  He shows up to his friends doorstep late at night and... there he is, before his friends very eyes, haha.  There's a catch though- he's not the way he was when alive.  He smells like decay, looks like crap, and has markings all over his face.  During this segment I could CERTAINLY do without all the swearing and especially dropping the F bomb several times a sentence.  I mean really, we don't need to experience that overused word *that* many times.  The word is constantly used afterwards too.Later on, the other friend dies so we have *two* vampires going around town, finding themselves involved in convenient store gun robberies in the middle of the night, and drinking the blood of the dead bodies.However, since this is technically a comedy, there's several laughable segments we see throughout the Revenant.  Perhaps the most memorable one is the two friends constantly trying to shoot and kill each other after a verbal argument only to not be affected by the gun blasts in the least.  Instead they stand back up and absorb more punishment while insulting each other, haha.  Another hilarious segment occurs when one character loses his head and in order for him to actually speak, his friend has to stick a... ahem, ""female device"" that provides intimate sensations up to his neck, lol.  The head says a funny line about this that had me and my father in stitches!I actually really like the ending.  I won't spoil what happens but I wasn't really expecting what occurs, and it's a nice surprise at least.If you're looking for a horror movie you're going to be INCREDIBLY disappointed since there's nothing scary about this one.  Perhaps the blood sensitive types out there would have a bone to pick with the many puddles and shirt-stained blood markings we see by way of gunshots throughout the movie, but other than that, this is all about the laughs and poking fun at vampires.",4,odd take on the vampire genre,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,2614,"['Revenant', 'mix', 'comedy', 'horror', 'mainly', 'comedy', 'Hey', 'even', 'writers', '*tried*', 'combine', 'comedy', 'horror', 'default', 'comedy', 'would', 'win', 'out', 'overtake', 'horror', 'case', 'almost', 'single', 'time', 'moment', 'realize', 'film', 'written', 'purpose', 'laughs', 'jokes', '*all*', 'potential', 'horror', 'elements', 'immediately', 'lot', 'times', 'movies', 'are', 'NOT', 'able', 'succeed', 'attempting', 'combine', 'drastically', 'different', 'genres', 'film', 'perhaps', 'major', 'exception.Anyway', 'Revenant', 'two', 'friends', 'ultimately', 'become', 'vampires', 'Actually', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'one', 'friend', 'coming', 'back', 'life', 'other', 'one', 'attending', 'funeral', 'up', 'friends', 'doorstep', 'late', 'night', 'there', 'friends', 'very', 'eyes', 'haha', 'catch', 'though-', 'not', 'way', 'was', 'when', 'alive', 'decay', 'crap', 'markings', 'face', 'segment', 'could', 'CERTAINLY', 'do', 'swearing', 'especially', 'dropping', 'F', 'bomb', 'several', 'times', 'sentence', 'mean', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'experience', 'overused', 'word', '*that*', 'many', 'times', 'word', 'constantly', 'used', 'afterwards', 'too.Later', 'other', 'friend', 'dies', 'have', '*two*', 'vampires', 'going', 'around', 'town', 'finding', 'involved', 'convenient', 'store', 'gun', 'robberies', 'middle', 'night', 'drinking', 'blood', 'dead', 'bodies.However', 'technically', 'comedy', 'several', 'laughable', 'segments', 'see', 'Revenant', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'one', 'two', 'friends', 'constantly', 'trying', 'shoot', 'kill', 'other', 'verbal', 'argument', 'only', 'not', 'be', 'affected', 'gun', 'blasts', 'least', 'Instead', 'stand', 'back', 'up', 'absorb', 'more', 'punishment', 'insulting', 'other', 'haha', 'hilarious', 'segment', 'when', 'one', 'character', 'head', 'order', 'actually', 'speak', 'friend', 'stick', 'ahem', 'female', 'device', 'intimate', 'sensations', 'up', 'neck', 'lol', 'head', 'funny', 'line', 'had', 'father', 'stitches', 'actually', 'really', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'expecting', 'what', 'nice', 'surprise', 'least.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'horror', 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'INCREDIBLY', 'disappointed', 'nothing', 'scary', 'one', 'Perhaps', 'blood', 'sensitive', 'types', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'bone', 'pick', 'many', 'puddles', 'shirt-stained', 'blood', 'markings', 'see', 'way', 'gunshots', 'movie', 'other', 'laughs', 'poking', 'fun', 'vampires']",Revenant
1496169,ARMUEUP5JKC0U,B005NVMK7W,"Gigi Fuerte ""Child of the World""","[0, 0]","This movie is zany and trippy and dark and, well, bizarre. It's definitely an original. Someone called it a ""zomedy"" and that it is... sort of. The comedic aspects are about as dark as dark comedy gets. I did find myself laughing out loud a number of times though.Interestingly enough, this isn't exactly a ""B"" movie. It's quite well done--the acting is excellent, the effects are quite good when they are intended to be good (i.e. the talking head scenes), and cheesy when they're meant to be cheesy (like in the scene where a mortician moves the boom mic out of the way), the dialog is skillfully written and delivered, and the story line, though meandering and with no real meaty &lt;snicker snicker> central plot, per se, (unless you think a story line consisting of 2 guys, one a zombie, driving around the city in search of hookers, drugs, and human blood is a particularly substantial story line) somehow still manages to be rather engrossing.So the movie is a total contradiction. The heroes are really anti-hero slackers with only a few redeeming qualities but who still turn out to be likable somehow. Also, what we end up with here is a bit of a zombie origin story without really ever explaining the origin of the zombie infection. Yeah, I know that sounds like it doesn't make any sense but really, that's how it goes in this film and somehow it all makes sense... And finally, the mix of excellent special effects coupled with intentionally cheesy ones adds to the odd flavor (pun intended) of this flick.As might be expected in such a flick: lots (and I mean lots) of gore, a wee bit of full frontal male and female nudity, plentiful drug use, and a sh*t ton of cursing.I've taken 1 star off for some inconsistencies in the characters' reactions to situations.If you like Dr. Strangelove, Harold and Kumar, and zombies, and particularly think the idea of all three mixed together into one glorious and grotesque yet brilliant mess of a delicious concoction sounds swell, you'll dig this flick.",4,What a trippy ride,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,2008,"['movie', 'zany', 'trippy', 'dark', 'well', 'bizarre', 'definitely', 'original', 'Someone', 'called', 'zomedy', 'sort', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'are', 'as', 'dark', 'dark', 'comedy', 'did', 'find', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'number', 'times', 'though.Interestingly', 'enough', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'B', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'excellent', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'when', 'are', 'intended', 'be', 'good', 'i.e', 'talking', 'head', 'scenes', 'cheesy', 'when', ""'re"", 'meant', 'be', 'cheesy', 'scene', 'where', 'mortician', 'boom', 'way', 'dialog', 'skillfully', 'written', 'delivered', 'story', 'line', 'meandering', 'real', 'meaty', 'lt', 'snicker', 'snicker', '>', 'central', 'plot', 'se', 'think', 'story', 'line', 'consisting', '2', 'guys', 'one', 'zombie', 'driving', 'city', 'search', 'hookers', 'drugs', 'human', 'blood', 'particularly', 'substantial', 'story', 'line', 'somehow', 'still', 'be', 'rather', 'engrossing.So', 'movie', 'total', 'contradiction', 'heroes', 'are', 'really', 'anti-hero', 'slackers', 'only', 'few', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'who', 'still', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'likable', 'somehow', 'Also', 'what', 'end', 'up', 'here', 'bit', 'zombie', 'origin', 'story', 'really', 'ever', 'explaining', 'origin', 'zombie', 'infection', 'Yeah', 'know', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'really', 'how', 'film', 'somehow', 'sense', 'finally', 'mix', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', 'coupled', 'intentionally', 'cheesy', 'ones', 'odd', 'flavor', 'pun', 'intended', 'flick.As', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'such', 'flick', 'lots', 'mean', 'lots', 'gore', 'wee', 'bit', 'full', 'frontal', 'male', 'female', 'nudity', 'plentiful', 'drug', 'use', 'sh*t', 'ton', 'cursing.I', ""'ve"", 'taken', '1', 'star', 'inconsistencies', 'characters', 'reactions', 'situations.If', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'zombies', 'particularly', 'think', 'idea', 'three', 'mixed', 'together', 'one', 'glorious', 'grotesque', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'mess', 'delicious', 'concoction', 'swell', ""'ll"", 'dig', 'flick']",Revenant

American soldier Bart Gregory (David Anders) is ambushed and killed while serving in Iraq.

The two buddies conclude that Bart is now a ""revenant,"" a combination vampire/zombie who's undead and has an insatiable thirst for blood.  At first, they try to satisfy Bart's urges by stealing blood from a hospital, but when they stumble on a convenience store robbery and kill the assailant, another solution comes to mind.  They'll roam Los Angeles' streets by night and do away with bad guys, thereby providing Bart with a steady supply of fresh blood and easing the city's crime epidemic in the process.""The Revenant"" borrows elements from ""An American Werewolf in London,"" ""Death Wish,"" ""My Best Friend Is a Vampire,"" and ""Once Bitten.""  It's a blending of plot points in both vampire and zombie lore.  To satisfy horror purists, there is plenty of gore, and the writing is quite clever.
