There is a certain elegance that these older Shaw B films have that I was unaware of. Even thought the plot is fairly simple and straight forward, the characters are real and likable. Even the villain, as twisted and evil as he is, is still a guy you really can't hate. The action is old school methodical style but the whole film has an effortless flow that draws you in.Yes we all know who and what Red Sun is. But considering they are giving us an UNCUT (unike the Dragon Dynasty release)  filmwith acceptable (great) image quality...well...Expect the audio to switch to original language for a few seconds here and there. This is the lost footage that was never translated so no subs for these parts either.",5,Necessary evil...,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,777,"['Not', '34', ""chop'socky"", '34', 'film', 'actual', 'Martial', 'arts', 'drama', 'certain', 'elegance', 'older', 'Shaw', 'B', 'films', 'have', 'was', 'unaware', 'Even', 'thought', 'plot', 'fairly', 'simple', 'straight', 'forward', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'likable', 'Even', 'villain', 'twisted', 'evil', 'still', 'guy', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hate', 'action', 'old', 'school', 'methodical', 'style', 'whole', 'film', 'effortless', 'flow', 'in.Yes', 'know', 'who', 'what', 'Red', 'Sun', 'considering', 'are', 'giving', 'UNCUT', 'Dragon', 'Dynasty', 'release', 'filmwith', 'acceptable', 'great', 'image', 'quality', 'well', 'Expect', 'audio', 'switch', 'original', 'language', 'few', 'seconds', 'here', 'there', 'lost', 'footage', 'was', 'never', 'translated', 'so', 'subs', 'parts']",Avenging Eagle [All Region DVD]

985017,A3QTB346UKG6TV,B000F7V9Z8,Mantis,"[4, 4]","This film came as a bit of a surprise.  A good story, good acting, good fights, and a great pace.  I won't say it's perfect, but I can't think of too much that would have made it better.  Maybe if they laid off of some of the ""pause-before-impact"" photography, but that's only used a couple of times, and briefly.  There's some obvious coincidence that I could do without, but then the story wouldn't work.Ti Lung is a man who (after a change of conscience) has defected from his former gang, the 13 Eagles (a subsidiary of the Iron Boat Clan), who raised and trained him since childhood for their own sadistic acts.  Alexander Fu Sheng is a man, searching for revenge, who helps Ti Lung fight off his former brothers.  Many fights ensue, mostly with weapons.  My man, Ti, uses triple irons, one of my favorites.The picture and sets are as beautiful as anything I've seen from Shaw Brothers.  This whole movie is gorgeous.  I thought I was buying the Red Sun version, but got another, whose distributor is anonymous.  Other critics have mentioned some forgivable flaws in the Red Sun version, so I may have made out because there are NONE on this one.

Now the you most likely have seen this if your are seeking out the red sun 16:9 PICTURE, CRYSTAL CLEAR REMASTERING JOB, so I will tell you the 3 problems first.1.-It changes from english dub to chinese dialogue for around 6 words spoken, it actually didn't matter at all.2.-In the final fight there is a 20 second monent where it swithches to like the gound zero version only widesceened, they may hve been missing a piece of film, but this is acepptable only because it happens ONLY for 20 seconds.3.-The 3rd one here is the only notable one.  There is a loud beep liek 55 minutes into the movie, it made me jump and was pretty loud.  But it is only for like a half a second.So anyway, if you have not seen this then you are in for a big surpeise.  I would compare this to killer constable as far as the mood of the movie.  But the action is far superior to that movie and this one does a good job at being a real movie.  That is until the fights breakout, btu that is acceptable, hey, that's why i watch them.  So the fights are good, btu to be honest, they do actually kind of slow down the movie, it is seriously that good.  fu sheng shines in this one and ti lung has instnatly become one of my altime favorites after this.  his facial hair is kind if weak as it looks like it was just painted on btu the movie itself is very gritty and you prabablyu have never seen nanything like it.The story starts with showign how cold blooded ti lung is and since I don't want to give anything away  I will leave it at that.  But just like the great ku lugn novel movies, everyone is out for themselves even when they are being portrayed as say the hero.  Some of the characters are down right mean and they don't hide it but this could have been a ku lung movie because it is defintiely that style.Nwo the dvd special features are like 2 trailers, it is uncut, but the movie itslef is only about 90 minutes.  So red sun it would have taken like 20 errors for me not to have liked this release, I don't know if this company is still making these, btu there are fewew and fewer on the shelves in the last year or so.  So whether you have seen it on the ground zero version or haven't seen it at all, then buy this movie.",5,"THE FIRST RED SUN RELEASE I HAVE EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEMS WITH, BUT THERE ARE ONLY 3 AN DALL ARE EXCEPTABLE WITH HOW GOOD IT IS",1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,2300,"['movie', 'sooooooo', 'good', 'been', 'while', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'Now', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'seeking', 'out', 'red', 'sun', '16:9', 'PICTURE', 'CRYSTAL', 'CLEAR', 'REMASTERING', 'JOB', 'will', 'tell', '3', 'problems', 'first.1.-It', 'changes', 'english', 'dub', 'chinese', 'dialogue', '6', 'words', 'spoken', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'all.2.-In', 'final', 'fight', '20', 'second', 'monent', 'where', 'like', 'gound', 'zero', 'version', 'only', 'widesceened', 'may', 'hve', 'been', 'missing', 'piece', 'film', 'acepptable', 'only', 'ONLY', '20', 'seconds.3.-The', '3rd', 'one', 'here', 'only', 'notable', 'one', 'loud', 'beep', 'liek', '55', 'minutes', 'movie', 'made', 'jump', 'was', 'pretty', 'loud', 'only', 'half', 'second.So', 'anyway', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'then', 'are', 'big', 'surpeise', 'would', 'compare', 'killer', 'constable', 'as', 'far', 'mood', 'movie', 'action', 'far', 'superior', 'movie', 'one', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'real', 'movie', 'fights', 'breakout', 'btu', 'acceptable', 'hey', 'why', 'i', 'watch', 'fights', 'are', 'good', 'btu', 'be', 'honest', 'do', 'actually', 'kind', 'slow', 'movie', 'seriously', 'good', 'fu', 'sheng', 'shines', 'one', 'ti', 'lung', 'instnatly', 'become', 'one', 'altime', 'facial', 'hair', 'kind', 'weak', 'was', 'just', 'painted', 'movie', 'very', 'gritty', 'prabablyu', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'nanything', 'it.The', 'story', 'showign', 'how', 'cold', 'blooded', 'ti', 'lung', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'will', 'leave', 'just', 'great', 'ku', 'lugn', 'novel', 'movies', 'everyone', 'out', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'being', 'portrayed', 'say', 'hero', 'characters', 'are', 'down', 'right', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'hide', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ku', 'lung', 'movie', 'defintiely', 'dvd', 'special', 'features', 'are', '2', 'trailers', 'uncut', 'movie', 'itslef', 'only', 'about', '90', 'minutes', 'So', 'red', 'sun', 'would', 'have', 'taken', '20', 'errors', 'not', 'have', 'liked', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'company', 'still', 'making', 'btu', 'are', 'fewew', 'fewer', 'shelves', 'last', 'year', 'so', 'have', 'seen', 'ground', 'zero', 'version', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'then', 'buy', 'movie']",Avenging Eagle [All Region DVD]
