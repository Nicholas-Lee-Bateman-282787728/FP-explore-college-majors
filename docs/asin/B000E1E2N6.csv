(one myth asserts that the bits were removed from the horses' mouths so that they couldn't be stopped. No creditable horseman would do that)The Grays blew out their horses in that charge while the French Lancers just sat there waiting for them to come. Thus, fresh French horses and staggering Grays.In the British favor - the French had slept on their horses the night before to stay off the wet ground and later on the strained animals couldn't make a proper charge. Shades of Argincort when the French Knights slept on their horses to stay off the wet ground.Steiger is a bit OTT as Napoleon but so was Napoleon. Plummer is just about channelling Wellington.Incredible aerials of the armies setting up, like a giants' chess set.I find the off-field scenes tabloid and wooden. But stay for the battle. The Cavalry eating away at the British Squares is brilliantly filmed. Wellington was in trouble at that point. Old Boney had almost won that battle.  Then Blucher shows up. In his 70's, barely having survived a horse falling on him several days earlier. He did everything but fly a black flag that day.Astounding film of astounding history.

964934,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000E1E2N6,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[20, 23]","I hadn't realized this earlier, but now having put it in the DVD, I've seen the results of this Russian import.Russia does not use PAL encoding in their DVDs.  They use NTSC just like North America.  And yet the framerate is badly and blatantly off.To clarify one bit, you notice the difference in how video looks when it's presented in movies and fiction TV shows compared to News broadcasts or reality shows?  That's a difference in framerate---the News shows and reality shows and the like use a faster framerate.  This movie was filmed to be in the framerate of a movie, and yet it looks as though it was sped up or somehow adjusted to move like a television show.  As such, it looks less like a movie and more like a BBC television show or the like.Maybe this contributes to this, but the biggest and most severe issue with this release that utterly ruins it is the audio and video is NOT SYNCHRONIZED!Even a sneaking suspicion should be enough to confirm this, but it becomes hugely evident in scenes where the actors' mouth words clearly.  This completely ruins von Bl&uuml;cher's grand introduction at the battle, where he shouts ""Raise high the black flags, my children.  No prisoners.  No pity.  I will shoot any man I see with pity in him.""  It's so unbelievably obvious, you'd think he was speaking another language and having it overdubbed in English.  But no, he IS speaking English, and yet the audio is so badly out of sync with the video, it becomes a massive detriment to the movie as a whole, and rips one out of the immersion entirely.The picture quality is nowhere near as clean and sharp as I expected, considering the version I first saw was not even in DVD quality.  It's smooth, but very much with a sense of being intentionally blurred, with a very clear and noticeable amount of artifacting on screen.If there was a 3 hour version that was released in Russia (because I know the film was originally 4 hours, but then cut down to 2 and such), then this certainly isn't it.  This also has no bonus features at all.If the Asian import has proper audio/video synchronization, I'd advise anyone seeking this work in DVD to get that one, because this release is broken.",1,DVD release is horrible,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,2190,"['had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'earlier', 'now', 'having', 'put', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'results', 'Russian', 'import.Russia', 'not', 'use', 'PAL', 'encoding', 'DVDs', 'use', 'NTSC', 'just', 'North', 'America', 'yet', 'framerate', 'badly', 'blatantly', 'off.To', 'clarify', 'one', 'bit', 'notice', 'difference', 'how', 'video', 'when', 'presented', 'movies', 'fiction', 'TV', 'shows', 'compared', 'News', 'broadcasts', 'reality', 'shows', 'difference', 'framerate', '-the', 'News', 'shows', 'reality', 'shows', 'like', 'use', 'faster', 'framerate', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'be', 'framerate', 'movie', 'yet', 'was', 'sped', 'up', 'somehow', 'adjusted', 'move', 'television', 'show', 'such', 'less', 'movie', 'more', 'BBC', 'television', 'show', 'like.Maybe', 'biggest', 'most', 'severe', 'issue', 'release', 'utterly', 'audio', 'video', 'NOT', 'SYNCHRONIZED', 'Even', 'sneaking', 'suspicion', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'confirm', 'hugely', 'evident', 'scenes', 'where', 'actors', 'mouth', 'words', 'clearly', 'completely', 'von', 'Bl', 'uuml', 'cher', 'grand', 'introduction', 'battle', 'where', 'Raise', 'black', 'flags', 'children', 'prisoners', 'pity', 'will', 'shoot', 'man', 'see', 'pity', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'obvious', ""'d"", 'think', 'was', 'speaking', 'language', 'having', 'overdubbed', 'English', 'speaking', 'English', 'yet', 'audio', 'so', 'badly', 'sync', 'video', 'massive', 'detriment', 'movie', 'whole', 'rips', 'one', 'immersion', 'picture', 'quality', 'nowhere', 'near', 'clean', 'sharp', 'expected', 'considering', 'version', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'DVD', 'quality', 'smooth', 'very', 'much', 'sense', 'being', 'intentionally', 'blurred', 'very', 'clear', 'noticeable', 'amount', 'artifacting', 'screen.If', 'was', '3', 'hour', 'version', 'was', 'released', 'Russia', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'originally', '4', 'hours', 'then', 'cut', 'down', '2', 'such', 'then', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'also', 'bonus', 'Asian', 'import', 'proper', 'audio/video', 'synchronization', ""'d"", 'advise', 'anyone', 'seeking', 'work', 'DVD', 'get', 'one', 'release', 'broken']",Waterloo
964935,A12QL3YE58F9RI,B000E1E2N6,"B. C. Whitcomb ""WTF?!""","[2, 2]","And for good reason...When the movie Waterloo was first conceived, producer Dino De Laurentis knew it was going to be a massive undertaking in terms of resources and finances. The  project was so massive, it required the support of the Soviet Union. So, in cooperation with the USSR, Waterloo was brought to the screen in all its astonishing glory. Enlisting Russian director Sergei Bondarchuk, the creator of ""War and Peace"", another massive Soviet-produced film epic, as well as 16,000 Red Army reservists, engineers, and technicians, the movie massive scope was realized. But like all epics, Waterloo does get crushed under its own massive weight. There were immediate conflicts with the screenplay, particularly from Rod Seiger, who thought the movie should have been entitled ""Napolean"", as well as the logistics of turning a portion of the Ukrainian countryside into a replica of the battlefield, resulting in the removal of three hills, the replanting of 5,000 trees, and the construction of replicas of the buildings and Belgian villages that populated the battlefield. The choice of Canadian actor Christopher Plumber as the Duke of Wellington was a masterstroke of casting, as he portrays the British general with the usual steely English discipline and humour one would expect. And this is the movie's biggest failure: it plays more to caricature rather than to historical fact. The French are portrayed as emotional bundles of nerves, the British as uptight or outrageously loutish, and the Prussians as near-psychopatic. The movie does get into scenes that are downright Monty Python-esque, as in the scene when Lord Uxbridge loses his leg to an artillery shell. One would think that he was about to say, ""Tis only a flesh wound, Your Grace."" And insofar as the movie is concerned, it was the Prussians who saved Wellington's hide. But that's not the official account, as was written by Wellington in his dispatches.",3,THEY DON'T MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS ANYMORE...,1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,1929,"['good', 'reason', 'When', 'movie', 'Waterloo', 'was', 'first', 'conceived', 'producer', 'Dino', 'De', 'Laurentis', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'massive', 'undertaking', 'terms', 'resources', 'finances', 'project', 'was', 'so', 'massive', 'required', 'support', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'So', 'cooperation', 'USSR', 'Waterloo', 'was', 'brought', 'screen', 'astonishing', 'glory', 'Enlisting', 'Russian', 'director', 'Sergei', 'Bondarchuk', 'creator', 'War', 'Peace', 'massive', 'Soviet-produced', 'film', 'epic', 'as', 'well', '16,000', 'Red', 'Army', 'reservists', 'engineers', 'technicians', 'movie', 'massive', 'scope', 'was', 'realized', 'epics', 'Waterloo', 'get', 'crushed', 'own', 'massive', 'weight', 'were', 'immediate', 'conflicts', 'screenplay', 'particularly', 'Rod', 'Seiger', 'who', 'thought', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'entitled', 'Napolean', 'as', 'well', 'logistics', 'turning', 'portion', 'Ukrainian', 'countryside', 'replica', 'battlefield', 'resulting', 'removal', 'three', 'hills', 'replanting', '5,000', 'trees', 'construction', 'replicas', 'buildings', 'Belgian', 'villages', 'populated', 'battlefield', 'choice', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'Christopher', 'Plumber', 'Duke', 'Wellington', 'was', 'masterstroke', 'casting', 'British', 'general', 'usual', 'steely', 'English', 'discipline', 'humour', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'movie', 'biggest', 'failure', 'more', 'caricature', 'rather', 'historical', 'fact', 'French', 'are', 'portrayed', 'emotional', 'bundles', 'nerves', 'British', 'uptight', 'outrageously', 'loutish', 'Prussians', 'near-psychopatic', 'movie', 'get', 'scenes', 'are', 'downright', 'Monty', 'Python-esque', 'scene', 'when', 'Lord', 'Uxbridge', 'leg', 'artillery', 'shell', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'say', 'Tis', 'only', 'flesh', 'wound', 'Grace', 'insofar', 'movie', 'concerned', 'was', 'Prussians', 'who', 'saved', 'Wellington', 'hide', 'not', 'official', 'account', 'was', 'written', 'Wellington', 'dispatches']",Waterloo
964936,A1YQJ6JI1RTOFA,B000E1E2N6,Blockhed Blockhed,"[4, 4]","This re-creation of the battle of Waterloo will never be surpassed. The advent of special effects means that it will never again be possible for such a massive array of manpower to be assembled in order to make a motion picture, and therefore the portrayal of this mighty conflict will never be equalled for realism. The scenes are stupendous and awe-inspiring, and make one constantly marvel at the sheer magnitude of the achievement and control of this gigantic cast. It is probably necessary to have some prior knowledge of the course of the battle, but repeated viewings will eventually make everything clear. The performances of Plummer and Steiger are absolutely top-notch: both truly give superlative impersonations of the two major protagonists. Since they were so different in character and personality it is impossible to say which is the better. The unfolding of the events, and the contextualization of this epic encounter, are also extremely well-written and directed. Of course, all the classic incidents and quotes are retained, which may sometimes strike one as a touch over-familiar: but how could they be omitted? An excellent balance is maintained throughout, and the overall effect is nothing short of astonishing.

Waitkoss ""movie/book madman""","[2, 2]","Sergei Bondarchuk's ""Waterloo"" is a fitting companion piece to his larger and more complex filming of ""War and Peace""--in a real sense the end of the story since you see Napoleon's last attempt to gain a foothold of power in both France and Europe.  However, unlike ""War and Peace"" with some of the settings looking a bit on the (forgive me Sergei) cheap side, this is an elaborate production with details, costumes, and winning performances by both Rod Steiger as Napoleon (tottering on the edge of genius and an emotional breakdown almost similar to Adolf Hitler) and Plummer's Wellington who apppears to be an aristocratic SOB expecting his ""boys"" to fight and die for him while not giving them equal status as human beings.  There is a small part with Orson Welles, as the French king, but it is so minor that one wonders why he is even there, but then it was partially produced by Dino DeLaurentiis.Finally, while many of Dino DeLaurentiis' films are flawed, think of the remake of ""King Kong"", the man never shirked on spending on his films and the money shows in the fighting scenes featuring the Russian Army as both the French and the British/Prussian forces.

964938,A31N1LSANGQ3UB,B000E1E2N6,Dave K,"[53, 55]","This Russian DVD is the best Region 1 presentation of the 1970 epic WATERLOO.  It previously was only available as a Region 2 import, which would not play on Region 1 players.  This anamorphically enhanced version with Dolby Digital sound is the best I have seen the film look.  And, yes, in spite of what some reviewers here say, it is a Russian DVD.  The DVD was made in Russia, as was the film.  The director, Sergei Bondarchuk had previously directed the acclaimed and equally spectacular Russian version of WAR AND PEACE a few years previous to this.As far as historical epics go, I would say it is more accurate than most.  I'm a Napoleonic nut, and can spot the innacuaracies in the film, but they are not that severe, and usually serve to move the story along.  All the great moments of the story are here: Napoleon's farewell to the Old Guard; the 5th Regiment joining Napoleon upon his return from Elba; Wellington @ the Duchess of Richmond's ball; the assaults on Hougoumont & La Haye Sainte; the deperate French cavalry charges on the British squares; the final doomed assault of the Old Guard as the Prussians take the field.The battle sceees are spectacular, with thousands of men and horses thundering across the screen.  Many scenes replicate famous paintings, such as Lady Butler's ""Scotland forever!"".  The main cast members are outstanding.  Steiger is monumental as Napoleon; Plummer aloof and brilliant as Wellington, Dan O'Herlihy brusque and forceful as Marshall Ney, Virginia MacKenna elegant as the Duchess of Richmond.  There are other fine cameos sprinkled thoughout (including Orson Welles as Louix XVIII).  Some of the minor characters are obviously speaking Russian and are dubbed, but this is no great distraction.The only caveat: the opening scene is quite poor.  They tried to cram in a lot of exposition to explain how Napoleon had reached a point in which he must abdicate the throne.  This scene has some terrible and archly written dialog that makes one think the movie to follow is a joke.  But, hang in there.  Once you are past that scene, the entire movie improves and is actually well-written.The original Russian version of WATERLOO ran over three hours, and apparently included Ligny and Quatre Bras, which are only alluded to by a couple of shots in this DVD version.  One hopes the missing hour or more will turn up, but in the meantime, the 2 hrs we have of the film are spectacular and literate enough to stand on their own.  I rated it 4 out of 5, because thay could have mastered the film at a higher bitrate than they did, so some artifacting is present.

This movie not only has that ""cast of tens of thousands"" sweep, but very strong performances by some of the greatest actors of all time.  The brooding, method acting of Rod Steiger presents a credible and convincing interpretation of the overweight, frustrated 45 year old Emperor Napoleon who shocked Europe with a last gasp attempt to restore his fortunes. The force of his personality and ability to inspire confidence and devotion is easy to see in Steiger's interpretation.  Plummer, Welles, Hawkins and Wilding also do creditable work in depicting commanders.  ---  As a war movie, this one must stand among the very best masterpieces of all time.  Only a totalitarian state from the old Soviet bloc could have assembled vast armies of extras, expensive costumes, immense battle scenes and elaborate cinematic artistry without the costs associated with actors unions and bankruptcy.

As General Ney looks on at his departing Emperor.This movie is full of wonderful scenes and dialogue. Although no one has seen the complete movie in a long time; the pieces that we have are highly atmospheric and evoke the era very well.Perhaps one of the most impressive is something that has not been mentioned in full by other reviewers and that is the Duchess of Richmond's Ball. This was a true event and it is masterfully handled in a very romantic and aristocratic manner. Beginning with a Sword dance by General Gordon's troops; there follows a wonderful courtly ballroom dance enhanced by candlelight.The scenes regarding Delancey and his wife as well as Lord Hay and Sarah make for a very believable re-enactment of love and the urgency of departure for soldiery that speaks wonders for the tragic loss of youth and love in war.Another great aspect that has also been neglected by reviewers is the consistent ""inner thoughts"" of Napoleon and Wellington the night before the battle that are revealed to us. This more than any other acting brings to full light the doubts and uncertainty before the fight.Also the breakfast scene of Napoleon and his Generals, played to perfection by the wide eyed Rod Steiger as Napoleon as he asks inquiringly about the sound of the Church bells and is informed that the local priest refuses to give up his Mass, will we ever forget his response ""Well, he won't have much of a congregation.""Or the revengeful shout on the battlefield by Blucher ""Raise high the Black flag my Children, No Pity, No Prisoners, I will shoot anyone I see with pity on them"". Wow! So you see, there is no need to describe things like great battle scenes and aspect ratios, widescreen, etc. All you need to know is that it is a film you will NEVER forget and it is perhaps still the best film of Napoleon ever made with marvelous acting and it should have won an award for costume designs at the very least and Christopher Plummer as best supporting actor for his role as the Duke of Wellington.Buy it!

And that mpeg file is 4:3.  That means that if you have a widescreen TV you will have black bars on all 4 sides and the actual picture is very small. You have the top and bottom black bars that are encoded in the video and you have left and right black bars because it's a 4:3 movie (technically, not picture wise).  Unless your TV has an outright zoom function there is nothing you can do about that, messing with the normal picture size control will not solve this, at least not without destroying the aspect ratio.The second problem are the subtitles which have been made in China by people with an insufficient command of the English language, of common phrases and also of personalities and locations involved in and round Waterloo. Best of all, you cannot turn them off. The only good thing is that they are hard encoded in that hard encoded bottom black bar.

I try to read up on history and everything I know about the battle fits this movie perfectly. I am not specfically a Napoleonic history buff, however, so I didn't quite catch the mistakes other reviewers claim, but I would regard those errors as unimportant. If I were to fault the movie for something it would be that it doesn't really give an idea about the significance of the engagements at Hougoumont and Haye Sainte.But the real treat of this movie is the visual spectacle. This is the closest thing to actually having been at the battle that anyone can come up with. Computer-generated images may some day reproduce the view of thousands upon thousands of men marching through gunpowder smoke and kicked-up dust and distorted by rising hot air. But they still can't. The aerial view of the blue wave of French cavalry spilling around the red British squares is one of the most breathtaking scenes you will ever see on film. The development of the characters from Napoleon's hubris to Wellington's quirky stuffiness was absorbing. Finally, the movie's parting message that there is no joy in the battlefield, even in victory, was poignant and indelible.I saw this movie as a kid with my father, and I now showed it to him and to my own son.

Of course this account is a true one but beyond that, it's so well-told here that I wonder how I might have overlooked it until now.Here we have the story of Napoleon's ultimate demise, his defeat by the British Duke of Wellington at Waterloo (in Belgium) who was aided late in the episode by the Prussian Army. The Emperor of France had suffered a monumental defeat in Russia, where he had lost nearly half a million men in 1812 and it wasn't long before he was exiled by his adversaries to the Island of Elba with several hundred of his loyal guards to keep him company. [For yet another more epic masterpiece regarding Napoleon's win in Austria and subsequent defeat in Russia, again directed by Ukrainian director Sergey Bondarchuk, get this specific edition ofWar and Peace (Special Edition).]About ten months later, Napoleon escaped his island home only to return to France, there usurping a briefly-ruling King Louis XVIII [played by Orson Wells in the film], and again declaring himself Emperor. Almost immediately he had to face Wellington's challenge, the latter having picked his ground carefully.This 128-minute 1970 movie is superb on several fronts:1. The battle scenes are epic with no shortage of extras, all in flawless period costume and equipped with the appropriate accoutrements of war. All the troop movements were carried out in an astonishingly precise manner.2. The cinematography is first-class, here depicted in letterbox format, (Panavision, Technicolor.)3. The film includes several actors of The First Water, Napoleon being played by Rod Steiger who was perfect in every sense for this role. The Duke of Wellington was played by Christopher Plummer who yielded a slightly hammy performance but was likely inspired to do so by a somewhat lyrical script. Dan O'Herlihy also co-stars.4. The filmscore by Nino Rota is quite excellent, very appropriate for such a presentation.The film itself represented a cooperative effort between Bondarchuk and producer Dino de Laurentiis.

I purchased it as a UK import years ago and this Russian import is, indeed, an upgrade. Watch it on a Blu-Ray machine and, even though its a DVD, it shines.Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer were born for their respective roles as Bonaparte and Wellington. This film also includes other great British actors (Jack Hawkins comes to mind). It also stars a cast of literally thousands (the Soviet Army, I suspect). I also have Bondarchuk's multi-disc version of ""War and Peace"" and this is a worthy companion piece - better because it concentrates fully on a single battle. Although others may quibble about details, the uniforms, pagentry and sheer scale of the film are stunning. A film like this could never be produced today, and it is a poster child for the argument against CGI.Some favorite scenes are:1. the Scots Guards sword dance at the British camp near Brussels2. The Scots Greys charge (and their defeat by napoleon's lancers)3. The Scots Guards attack4. Ney's fatal cavalry attack on the British squares (a scene reminicent of the final scene of the Battle of Britain film - those who have seen both will know why)5. The final advance of the Old Guard6. The arrival of the Prussians.La Haye Sainte and Hougoumont are not portrayed in as much detail as I would have liked, but that's quibling.One interesting observation is regarding the opening scene where napoleon's generals are stomping down the corridor to meet their leader. The scene was duplicated almost exactly a few years later in ""A Bridge Too Far"" - only this time with German generals meeting Von Rundstedt. I expect Sir Richard Attenborough was a huge Bondarchuk fan. With good cause.There are a whole series on one liners which are memorable. The one which comes to mind is Napoleon's comment upon the arrival of Blucher's Prussians: ""I made one mistake. I should have burned Berlin!!""I can not recommend this film more highly.

The film is well done and for the time, when it was produced;avoids the tendency of large scale historical productions to represent action and substitute authenticity with adapted modern and available technologies. The aerial views are remarkable and the acting of the principle characters is equally so. I would say that it would be possible to view the Russian language version without losing too much of the flow of the history because of the direction. The character portrayals are revealing of the contesting personalities and in the critical moments of the battle itself, indicative of the margin of time and tactics, which in the end resulted in the historical conclusion. My only criticism of the film is that more time and detail could have been given to the battle after the climactic turn, providing more depth to the nature of battle in that time. It is complete, however, showing the aftermath and the consequences. One is drawn into the humanity of the event and its determining factors.",5,Waterloo,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,1112,"['Having', 'seen', 'film', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'pleased', 'had', 'become', 'available', 'DVD', 'format', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'produced', 'tendency', 'large', 'scale', 'historical', 'productions', 'represent', 'action', 'substitute', 'authenticity', 'adapted', 'modern', 'available', 'technologies', 'aerial', 'views', 'are', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'principle', 'characters', 'equally', 'so', 'would', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'view', 'Russian', 'language', 'version', 'losing', 'too', 'much', 'flow', 'history', 'direction', 'character', 'portrayals', 'are', 'revealing', 'contesting', 'personalities', 'critical', 'moments', 'battle', 'indicative', 'margin', 'time', 'tactics', 'end', 'resulted', 'historical', 'conclusion', 'only', 'criticism', 'film', 'more', 'time', 'detail', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'battle', 'climactic', 'turn', 'providing', 'more', 'depth', 'nature', 'battle', 'time', 'complete', 'however', 'showing', 'aftermath', 'consequences', 'One', 'drawn', 'humanity', 'event', 'determining', 'factors']",Waterloo
