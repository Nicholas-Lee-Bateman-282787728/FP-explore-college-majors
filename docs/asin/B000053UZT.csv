564987,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000053UZT,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[4, 4]","Initially, I bought both the Beginniners and Intermediate Mat Workouts, but since I had already had some familiarity with the basic Pilates moves (via Brooke Siler's excellent book, The Pilates Body), I probably could have jumped right to the intermediate level.  In this workout, instructor Ana Caban provides less information about how to do each exercise, proceeds a bit more quickly from one exercise to the next, and adds several more challenging Pilates moves.  All of the exercises are from the classic Pilates rotation and at an advanced beginner or intermediate level.Caban is an excellent instructor instructor:  her cuing is precise, and she is motivating and friendly without being overly peppy or intimidating.  She also does a good job of smoothly transitioning from one exercise to the next in the traditional Pilates style.  Assisting her is a Pilates student who does modified versions of almost all of the exercises.  I'd definitely recommend this tape to anyone who has some basic familiarity with Pilates and wants to move to a more thorough and challenging workout that is still attainable at the intermediate level.  Beginning exercisers or those new to Pilates should start with the Begininner's Mat Workout, as it contains more detailed instruction and is a bit shorter.Finally, about the video quality:  yes, the sound is a little echo-y at times and the color sometimes fades away briefly, but after you've watched the video a few times, you won't really focus those things; I've found these issues do not detract from this very good Pilates workout.",4,challenging yet doable intermediate Pilates practice,1012435200,"01 31, 2002",2002,1576,"['Initially', 'bought', 'Beginniners', 'Intermediate', 'Mat', 'Workouts', 'had', 'already', 'had', 'familiarity', 'basic', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'Brooke', 'Siler', 'excellent', 'book', 'Pilates', 'Body', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'jumped', 'right', 'intermediate', 'level', 'workout', 'instructor', 'Ana', 'Caban', 'less', 'information', 'how', 'do', 'exercise', 'bit', 'more', 'quickly', 'one', 'exercise', 'next', 'several', 'more', 'challenging', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'exercises', 'are', 'classic', 'Pilates', 'rotation', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'level.Caban', 'excellent', 'instructor', 'instructor', 'cuing', 'precise', 'motivating', 'friendly', 'being', 'overly', 'peppy', 'intimidating', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'smoothly', 'transitioning', 'one', 'exercise', 'next', 'traditional', 'Pilates', 'style', 'Assisting', 'Pilates', 'student', 'who', 'modified', 'versions', 'almost', 'exercises', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'tape', 'anyone', 'who', 'basic', 'familiarity', 'Pilates', 'move', 'more', 'thorough', 'challenging', 'workout', 'still', 'attainable', 'intermediate', 'level', 'Beginning', 'exercisers', 'new', 'Pilates', 'should', 'start', 'Begininner', 'Mat', 'Workout', 'more', 'detailed', 'instruction', 'bit', 'shorter.Finally', 'video', 'quality', 'yes', 'sound', 'little', 'echo-y', 'times', 'color', 'sometimes', 'away', 'briefly', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'video', 'few', 'times', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'focus', 'things', ""'ve"", 'found', 'issues', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'very', 'good', 'Pilates']",N/A

564990,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B000053UZT,CPTScott,"[38, 39]","I have been doing Pilates many months now each day before my Yoga practice and I can't say enough good things Pilates. At this point I have many excellent Pilates programs, including the outstanding Hilary Burnett Intermediate Pilates DVD!Though this program by Ana Caban is also an intermediate Pilates program it does have some different exercises than the Burnett. It includes a much more complete side lying series which are exercises that I find really beneficial (they really works the thighs, hips and glutes).I must admit that I was confused by some other reviewers complaints that this isn't an intermediate program because this DVD follows the Intermediate Pilates exercises plus includes many of the advanced exercises found in ""Pilates, Body In Motion"" by Alycea Ungaro.Anyway, I really like the flow of this program, the instruction, being geared to an intermediate practitioner, is kept to a minimum so as not to interrupt the flow which makes it very enjoyable to work with.My only complaint (and it's a VERY small one) would be that the audio is a bit strange in that sometimes it sounds like she's speaking ""from the back of the room"" where it's a bit echoey and other times the audio is more like a voice over (which is much easier to listen to and understand). I found this a bit distracting at times but it didn't take away from the overall excellence of this program.As in her Beginning Mat Work program she has another instructor who shows the poses in a more modified form if you need to work at a less intense level.I personally like Ana Caban as an instructor and find her personality to be enjoyable to practice with. She has a very positive and upbeat attitude which keeps it fun even while I'm being challenged :)Being that this is a true intermediate program, I would highly recommend getting a beginner program if you've never done Pilates before. The best one I have is the Stott Pilates Basics. Ana's beginning program is one I use as a less intense practice but the instruction isn't as precise as the Stott program. Pilates is a practice where precision is crucial in order to perform the exercises without straining your neck and back and without knowledge of the subtleties you may find you can hurt yourself, especially if you are working without a teacher.I don't have Hilary Burnett's Beginner program (just her intermediate as mentioned above) but I've heard that is excellent as well and plan on adding it to my collection to use for lighter days. Still, I don't own that yet so I'm passing along what I've heard.Anyway, this Ana Caban intermediate Pilates program is one I would highly recommend!Also, the DVD version of this program comes with a bonus Energy Boost workout which is 13 minutes long and is a fantastic extra workout. It alone is worth the prices of the DVD itself because it's short but very intense and it got my abs totally burning and fatigued in just 13 minutes. It's filmed on the beach in a beautiful tropical setting. I wish the whole intermediate DVD was filmed in the same setting but I guess you can't have everything! :)",5,Ana Caban Intermediate!,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,3089,"['have', 'been', 'doing', 'Pilates', 'many', 'months', 'now', 'day', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'Pilates', 'point', 'have', 'many', 'excellent', 'Pilates', 'programs', 'including', 'outstanding', 'Hilary', 'Burnett', 'Intermediate', 'Pilates', 'DVD', 'program', 'Ana', 'Caban', 'also', 'intermediate', 'Pilates', 'program', 'have', 'different', 'exercises', 'Burnett', 'much', 'more', 'complete', 'side', 'lying', 'series', 'are', 'find', 'really', 'beneficial', 'really', 'thighs', 'hips', 'glutes', '.I', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'confused', 'other', 'reviewers', 'complaints', ""n't"", 'intermediate', 'program', 'DVD', 'Intermediate', 'Pilates', 'many', 'advanced', 'exercises', 'found', 'Pilates', 'Body', 'Motion', 'Alycea', 'Ungaro.Anyway', 'really', 'flow', 'program', 'instruction', 'being', 'geared', 'intermediate', 'practitioner', 'kept', 'minimum', 'so', 'not', 'interrupt', 'flow', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'work', 'with.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'VERY', 'small', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'audio', 'bit', 'strange', 'speaking', 'back', 'room', 'where', 'bit', 'echoey', 'other', 'times', 'audio', 'more', 'voice', 'much', 'easier', 'listen', 'understand', 'found', 'bit', 'distracting', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'excellence', 'program.As', 'Beginning', 'Mat', 'Work', 'program', 'instructor', 'who', 'poses', 'more', 'modified', 'form', 'need', 'work', 'less', 'intense', 'level.I', 'personally', 'Ana', 'Caban', 'instructor', 'find', 'personality', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'practice', 'very', 'positive', 'upbeat', 'attitude', 'fun', 'even', ""'m"", 'being', 'challenged', 'Being', 'true', 'intermediate', 'program', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'beginner', 'program', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'Pilates', 'best', 'one', 'have', 'Stott', 'Pilates', 'Basics', 'Ana', 'beginning', 'program', 'one', 'use', 'less', 'intense', 'practice', 'instruction', ""n't"", 'as', 'precise', 'Stott', 'program', 'practice', 'where', 'precision', 'crucial', 'order', 'perform', 'exercises', 'straining', 'neck', 'back', 'knowledge', 'subtleties', 'may', 'find', 'can', 'hurt', 'especially', 'are', 'working', 'teacher.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Hilary', 'Burnett', 'Beginner', 'program', 'just', 'intermediate', 'mentioned', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'plan', 'adding', 'collection', 'use', 'lighter', 'days', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'yet', ""'m"", 'passing', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard.Anyway', 'Ana', 'Caban', 'intermediate', 'Pilates', 'program', 'one', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Also', 'DVD', 'version', 'program', 'bonus', 'Energy', 'Boost', 'workout', '13', 'minutes', 'long', 'fantastic', 'extra', 'workout', 'alone', 'prices', 'DVD', 'short', 'very', 'intense', 'got', 'abs', 'totally', 'burning', 'fatigued', 'just', '13', 'minutes', 'filmed', 'beach', 'beautiful', 'tropical', 'setting', 'wish', 'whole', 'intermediate', 'DVD', 'was', 'filmed', 'same', 'setting', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything']",N/A
