If you are a fan of the Spinners then this concert is a keeper. They are showing their age after all these years which is to be expected.,3,An Okay Concert,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,236,"['okay', 'hear', 'great', 'group', 'again', 'concert', 'was', 'so', 'so', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'once', 'are', 'fan', 'Spinners', 'then', 'concert', 'keeper', 'are', 'showing', 'age', 'years', 'be', 'expected']",N/A
1007921,A26H3PFS6CLKUX,B000GY73TQ,Brian M. Coffee,"[8, 8]",I like this DVD because it really showcases some classic r&b tunes done Philly style! The problem is that there is a new lead singer in the group. As we all know the original lead singer was Phillipe Wynn. Now the new guy is pretty good but he doesn't replace the original. Matter of fact the new guy does his best to emulate Phillipe but end the end he is not the man! However this dvd is worth the price and is definately a collectible for r&b fans!,3,Good DVD but ....,1187222400,"08 16, 2007",2007,451,"['like', 'DVD', 'really', 'classic', 'r', 'b', 'tunes', 'done', 'Philly', 'style', 'problem', 'new', 'lead', 'singer', 'group', 'know', 'original', 'lead', 'singer', 'was', 'Phillipe', 'Wynn', 'Now', 'new', 'guy', 'pretty', 'good', ""n't"", 'replace', 'original', 'Matter', 'fact', 'new', 'guy', 'best', 'emulate', 'Phillipe', 'end', 'end', 'not', 'man', 'However', 'dvd', 'price', 'definately', 'collectible', 'r', 'b', 'fans']",N/A

1007925,A2J6WBC58CIYMO,B000GY73TQ,RS,"[20, 21]","3 1/2 stars? O.K. - 4 stars. I am a huge Spinners fan and although I enjoyed this DVD, I felt I might have enjoyed it more. All the great songs are there, and the Bonus section has an extensive interview with the group. However, there was something slightly lackluster about the show - perhaps the subdued audience, or the aging performers themselves. Or the disparity that exists between our memories of the polished studio recordings of the songs and the (unavoidably) inferior live stage versions. Or maybe I'm just being too picky - I don't know. At any rate, Spinners fans (or fans of the genre) will still like this DVD, so by all means check it out. And for what it's worth, I saw the Spinners in a live show recently and was glad I did. It was pretty much the same act as on this DVD. They put 100% of themselves into their performance, and are truly a ""class"" act. But for the reasons stated, I'll refrain from giving it the ultimate 5 star rating.",4,The Mighty Spinners...,1156982400,"08 31, 2006",2006,957,"['3', '1/2', 'stars', 'O.K', '4', 'stars', 'am', 'huge', 'Spinners', 'fan', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'felt', 'might', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'great', 'songs', 'are', 'there', 'Bonus', 'section', 'extensive', 'interview', 'group', 'However', 'was', 'something', 'slightly', 'lackluster', 'show', 'perhaps', 'subdued', 'audience', 'aging', 'performers', 'disparity', 'memories', 'polished', 'studio', 'recordings', 'songs', 'unavoidably', 'inferior', 'live', 'stage', 'versions', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'being', 'too', 'picky', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'rate', 'Spinners', 'fans', 'fans', 'genre', 'will', 'still', 'like', 'DVD', 'so', 'means', 'check', 'out', 'what', 'worth', 'saw', 'Spinners', 'live', 'show', 'recently', 'was', 'glad', 'did', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'act', 'DVD', 'put', '100', '%', 'performance', 'are', 'truly', 'class', 'act', 'reasons', 'stated', ""'ll"", 'refrain', 'giving', 'ultimate', '5', 'star', 'rating']",N/A
