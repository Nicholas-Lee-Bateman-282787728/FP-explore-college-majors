The movie is richly sensual, from Nong Toom's realization that he wants to be female while watching a singer clad in gold,to his rigorous training in muay thai. From a distance, he sees a cute little girl with a purple flower in her hair... it's not young puppy love or his discovery of the opposite sex, but his desire to become female. He is mocked by the other boxers, struggles with his own weaknesses. He is delicate, feminine--but he has to fight in one of the most manly of sports. Among the handsome, shirtless fighters, he feels attracted. As a young Buddhist monk, he learns that he has to journey to his femininity because of his past karma. In a sense, he mirrors the Buddhist goddess of compassion, Kuan Yin. In Tibet, the god of compassion is Avalokiteshvara (the current Dalai Lama is deemed an emanation of him) Because of his delicate features, Chinese Buddhist missionaries thought he was female. By the time Avalokiteshvara traveled eastward to China and Japan, he became Kuan Yin/Gannon.""Beautiful Boxer"" tells a universal story. In this one, the hero's journey ends with him becoming the heroine. He sees his parents imprisoned, is mentored by a drag queen. It's a sensual, beautiful tale.

It is a beautiful film with outstanding acting and a sincerely expressed message about diversity and self acceptance. It would be so easy for a young transgender person who becomes a champion kick boxer to be satirized but this film takes the total high road and we get a wonderful film that feels genuine even if the story line seems like something out of a grocery store tabloid magazine. After seeing the film I can understand why the international film community loved this movie.The film is based on a true story of a champion kick boxer, Nong Toom, who enters kick boxing almost accidentally and finds that he could make enough money to pay for his sex change operation. But do such circumstances rise our of thin air? Of course not and the film explores the childhood and adolescence of this highly appealing young man who wants to be a woman.Asanee Suwan plays Nong Toom and his portrayal is exceptional. Suwan is a professional kick boxer which makes all the athletic scenes very authentic, but his acting skills also make all the painful life events touching. A transgender person feels from childhood that they are the opposite sex and this film starts with Nong Toom's childhood and explores how siblings and parents react to a little boy who wishes he was a little girl. Another significant character was Nong Toom's trainer Pi Chart who sees the potential in Nong Toom to become a champion kick boxer.The film is about overcoming obstacles to pursue personal truth and this makes the unique situation relevant to everyone on their path toward allowing their true self to emerge.",5,The quest for personal truth,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,1621,"['film', 'will', 'surprise', 'beautiful', 'film', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'sincerely', 'expressed', 'message', 'diversity', 'self', 'acceptance', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'easy', 'young', 'transgender', 'person', 'who', 'champion', 'kick', 'boxer', 'be', 'satirized', 'film', 'total', 'high', 'road', 'get', 'wonderful', 'film', 'genuine', 'even', 'story', 'line', 'something', 'grocery', 'store', 'tabloid', 'magazine', 'seeing', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'international', 'film', 'community', 'loved', 'movie.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'champion', 'kick', 'boxer', 'Nong', 'Toom', 'who', 'kick', 'boxing', 'almost', 'accidentally', 'could', 'make', 'enough', 'money', 'pay', 'sex', 'change', 'operation', 'do', 'such', 'circumstances', 'rise', 'thin', 'air', 'course', 'not', 'film', 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'highly', 'appealing', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'woman.Asanee', 'Suwan', 'Nong', 'Toom', 'portrayal', 'exceptional', 'Suwan', 'professional', 'kick', 'boxer', 'athletic', 'scenes', 'very', 'authentic', 'acting', 'skills', 'also', 'make', 'painful', 'life', 'events', 'touching', 'transgender', 'person', 'feels', 'childhood', 'are', 'opposite', 'sex', 'film', 'Nong', 'Toom', 'childhood', 'how', 'siblings', 'parents', 'react', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'significant', 'character', 'was', 'Nong', 'Toom', 'trainer', 'Pi', 'Chart', 'who', 'potential', 'Nong', 'Toom', 'become', 'champion', 'kick', 'boxer.The', 'film', 'overcoming', 'obstacles', 'pursue', 'personal', 'truth', 'unique', 'situation', 'relevant', 'everyone', 'path', 'allowing', 'true', 'self', 'emerge']",Beautiful Boxer

Makes me shudder to think how badly this movie would have been mangled in the hands of most Western (particularly American) directors like Steven Spielberg, who can't resist shoving some feel-good ""message"" down the viewer's throats and indulging in glib stereotypes or soggy histrionics.The fight scenes are not nearly as graphic and brutal as they could have been since this is after all Muay Thai, one of the most brutal martial arts in the world.  This could be disappointing or relieving, depending on your tastes.  However they are fairly convincing for a movie---you don't get the ludicrous ""Hollywood Kwon Do"" spinning jump cartwheel-kicks often seen in Van Damme and Chuck Norris films, and the fights do not consist of two guys taking turns suddenly deciding to drop his hands and be a punching bag for the other guy (as is standard for those pathetic ""Rocky"" movies).The acting is nothing to write home about but nothing to cringe at either---not anywhere as weak as ""Ong Bak: Thai Warrior"" which is another Thai film that features even more spectacular Muay Thai fight choreography.  Likewise, the plot keeps us engaged, and the film often has the audacity to segue into surreal, symbolic passages.  There are a few spots where it appears that the director is trying too hard to make this an oh-so-very hip, stylish MTVish music video with some jump cuts, colored/polarized lens filters such as during the first 5 minutes, but they are not fatal.I wish they had included some real fight footage of the real-life transvestite kickboxing champion that this movie is based upon, though.  All in all this is definitely worth seeing, it's a unique and fascinating look at a sport that is still underexposed here in the US, and a controversial subject matter (transexuals and transvestites) that the Thais seem to handle far more humanely and intelligently than we do.",4,"Beautiful boxer, beautiful film",1148083200,"05 20, 2006",2006,2011,"['elegant', 'tastefulness', 'gentleness', 'unpretentiousness', 'film', 'was', 'absolutely', 'refreshing', 'Definitely', 'Buddhist', 'flavor', 'Makes', 'shudder', 'think', 'how', 'badly', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'mangled', 'hands', 'most', 'Western', 'particularly', 'American', 'directors', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'shoving', 'feel-good', 'message', 'viewer', 'throats', 'indulging', 'glib', 'stereotypes', 'soggy', 'histrionics.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'graphic', 'brutal', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'martial', 'arts', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'disappointing', 'relieving', 'depending', 'tastes', 'However', 'are', 'fairly', 'convincing', 'movie', '-you', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'ludicrous', 'Hollywood', 'Kwon', 'Do', 'spinning', 'jump', 'cartwheel-kicks', 'often', 'seen', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'films', 'fights', 'do', 'not', 'consist', 'two', 'guys', 'taking', 'turns', 'suddenly', 'deciding', 'drop', 'hands', 'be', 'punching', 'bag', 'other', 'guy', 'standard', 'pathetic', 'Rocky', 'movies', '.The', 'acting', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'nothing', 'cringe', '-not', 'anywhere', 'as', 'weak', 'Ong', 'Bak', 'Thai', 'Warrior', 'Thai', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'spectacular', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'fight', 'choreography', 'Likewise', 'plot', 'engaged', 'film', 'often', 'audacity', 'segue', 'surreal', 'symbolic', 'passages', 'are', 'few', 'spots', 'where', 'director', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'oh-so-very', 'hip', 'stylish', 'MTVish', 'music', 'video', 'jump', 'cuts', 'colored/polarized', 'filters', 'such', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'are', 'not', 'fatal.I', 'wish', 'had', 'included', 'real', 'fight', 'footage', 'real-life', 'transvestite', 'kickboxing', 'champion', 'movie', 'based', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'unique', 'fascinating', 'look', 'sport', 'still', 'underexposed', 'here', 'US', 'controversial', 'subject', 'matter', 'transexuals', 'transvestites', 'Thais', 'seem', 'handle', 'far', 'more', 'humanely', 'intelligently', 'do']",Beautiful Boxer

There were some silly cinematic effects of Toom's transformation, along with some cliched timings of story events.  The transgender issue many be odd to some, but really, the treatment here was not particularly overt.  They did not show any gay scenes, although some were alluded to in one bath scene.The acting in general was kinda weak, Toom delivered his role well.The Muay Thai fights were great, and the training sequences inspiring.  In particular, I loved the cross-discipline fight betwen Toom's Muay Thai and female Japanese wrestling.  One may find such a gender mix odd, but really, Toom is on the feminine side of masculine while the Japanese wrestler is barely recognizable as a woman.Overall, this is one of the best Muay Thai movies out there.",4,"Good Muay Thai, ok acting",1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,930,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'inclination', 'write', 'thorough', 'review.After', 'much', 'anticipation', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'delivered', 'training', 'fighting', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'were', 'silly', 'cinematic', 'effects', 'Toom', 'transformation', 'cliched', 'timings', 'story', 'events', 'transgender', 'issue', 'many', 'be', 'odd', 'really', 'treatment', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'overt', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'gay', 'scenes', 'were', 'alluded', 'one', 'bath', 'scene.The', 'acting', 'general', 'was', 'kinda', 'weak', 'Toom', 'delivered', 'role', 'well.The', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'fights', 'were', 'great', 'training', 'sequences', 'inspiring', 'particular', 'loved', 'cross-discipline', 'fight', 'betwen', 'Toom', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'female', 'Japanese', 'wrestling', 'One', 'may', 'find', 'such', 'gender', 'mix', 'odd', 'really', 'Toom', 'feminine', 'side', 'masculine', 'Japanese', 'wrestler', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'woman.Overall', 'one', 'best', 'Muay', 'Thai', 'movies', 'out', 'there']",Beautiful Boxer
915149,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0009WPMA2,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","Rising even higher than the greatest expectations engendered by the International Press when it became a favorite of the film festivals, BEAUTIFUL BOXER is one of the more poetic, sensitive, luxuriously vivid and colorful films to come out of Thailand - and that is saying a lot, given the extravagant epics that yearly grow in popularity. This work of art is simply stunning in content, in direction, in acting, and in heartfelt simplicity of message. This is a great one! Writer/director Ekachai Uekrongtham based his first film on the true story of Parinaya Charoemphol AKA Nong Toom, a famous Thai athlete Muay Thai boxer (better known as 'kick boxer' - a demanding, dangerous sport) who entered the world of Muay Thai to garner enough money to help his family and pay for his ultimate sex-change surgery. A tough story to offer general audiences, perhaps, but Ekachai Uekrongtham presents this edgy biography with such cinematic finesse and care that it becomes a film that should appeal to a very wide audience. And much of that success is due to the towering performance by Asanee Suwan in his acting debut: Suwan is in life a professional kick boxer who won the title role after extensive auditions by many practitioners of Muay Thai.BEAUTIFUL BOXER takes us through the life of Nong Toom, his childhood in a family of loving accepting parents who respect his love of beauty and things feminine, his brief period of being a monk who must leave the monastery because of his inclinations, through his introduction to makeup and play-acting women's roles in the Thai theaters, his ridicule as being more girl than boy (a fact that results in his parents' incarceration!), and his devoted friendship with a girl who supports his desire for femininity and a young man who stands up for him in the boys' camp for learning sports. Gradually Nong Toom realizes that the only way he can make enough money to achieve a sex change operation is to become a successful kick boxer and he aligns himself with a trainer Pi Chart (Sorapong Chatree) and with much commitment and practice becomes Thailand's most famous Muay Thai. His self-respect is further established when he openly wears makeup in the boxing ring, causing many to believe his act is a gimmick and not the manifestation of his true transsexualism. He fights the toughest opponents and wins consistently until he at last arrives in Toyko for the 'big purse' of fighting female wrestler Kyoko Inoue (who plays herself). With the money from the fight he is able to have his surgery and becomes the famous actress and model now living in Bangkok.Under less sensitive eyes and minds this story could have become audacious, but instead the film elects to be sensitive to the transsexual conviction that Nong Toom is a woman trapped in a man's body, and it is the journey of self acceptance and personal victory that makes the story so deeply touching. Asanee Suwan, as a fine athlete, does all of his own fighting in the film and it is more choreography than brutality. He is amazing to watch and coupled with the fact that he is so wholly convincing in his fine acting that he makes this young transsexual utterly credible in movement, emotional density, and purity of vision is an extraordinary achievement.Yes, the film has a few flaws of editing and other minor aspects, but the overwhelming power of the story more than compensates for those 'first film' learning curves. Highly recommended for ALL audiences, especially for those who fear there will be gratuitous physical scenes that might offend. There are none!

I was fascinated by the exotic setting and the world of kick boxing.  And I was even more fascinated by the fact that this particular young man became famous throughout Thailand by wearing full makeup in the ring as well as consistently winning every fight.We first meet young Nong Toom as a child.  He finds a lipstick and dresses up to amuse his family.  Later, when the family falls into poverty, he discovers he is good at kick boxing and helps support them.  After schooling in a monastery where he discovers he does not belong, he enrolls in a kick boxing camp where he trains very hard in this form of martial arts.  However, he still likes to put on makeup and does it secretly.  When he is discovered, his instructor tells him to wear it in the boxing ring.  It completely unnerves his opponents.I found this all fascinating as I had never seen a kick boxing match.  It certainly involves strength and coordination and a willingness to be hurt.  The combatants wear boxing gloves but they also use their bare feet to fight.  It looks like a difficult and precise art that requires discipline and courage to master.  Our hero does just that in spite of many obstacles.However, our hero lives a tortured life as he really wants to be a woman.  By now the audience understands this wants him to get his dream.I really enjoyed this film.  It held my interest throughout and although at times it was predictable, I just couldn't stop watching.

915153,A396UCZ3R9AWX1,B0009WPMA2,Michael,"[1, 3]","A highly watchable film, set in lush locales and featuring several beautiful boxers indeed. The main actor does a formidable job, especially in light of the fact that this is his first feature film. As entertainment, it excels in many ways. By the end, however, it was obvious that only half the story had been told. Based on true events, ""Beautiful Boxer"" is by nature an intensely personal story, and yet, surprisingly, it was also extremely prudish. It traces the protagonist's transformation from male to female, but it says zero about his sex life or romantic attractions. Did he never fall in love or have sex? In this film, these are apparently taboo topics.  Perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to intrude into Nong Toom's ""private life."" That would be rather paradoxical, considering the subject matter. The silence surrounding Nong Toom's sexuality might be attributed to idol worship, prudery, or maybe even homophobia. If it's OK to talk about Nong Toom's sex-change operation, why isn't it OK to talk about her love life? And if, in the remote chance that she really was averse to having sex and/or never fell in love with anybody, then that could have been built into the story in an explicit way, because the viewer is bound to be curious about these matters, given the nature of the story.

You get to watch his struggles as he grew up and why he did what he did. Everything from the beginning to the tear-jerking end is ripe with meaning. Superb acting and movie direction! As you watch this movie, note the pauses and the music being played throughout the movie, with each pause emphasizing on the moment of focus.

""Beautiful Boxer"" is exactly what you might expect: a well-meaning debut with strong subject matter left unexamined and weak acting, directing and cinematography. It's about the personal and social trauma of changing gender, but it treats its still-living subject so respectfully that we learn nothing about the young man's sexuality or later about the young woman's he has become.Disappointing, yes, but there are compensations. Asanee Suwan's acting may be weak but he projects a sweet nature and his ring prowess is not to be denied. His gimmick to get noticed, kickboxing as a pretty transvestite, is exploited by promoters to earn celebrity, big matches and money for his sex-change. Surprisingly, his family loves and supports him. Who can resist a twist like that?

915161,ALSKUJF2WZ44L,B0009WPMA2,Windwolfess,"[0, 0]","I first heard about this person nearly 10 years ago when I was moderating a website for transsexual athletes.  One of the members was an Italian woman who boxed in Italy before she transitioned.  I was fascinated with what she wrote about this Thai kickboxer who had become a champion as she transitioined, and read what I could on the web.  When I heard of this movie some years later, I was very anxious to see it.  It was not a disappointment.The plot is simple enough, as are most impossibly difficult situations in life.  A young boy in an impoverished rural family wishes for nothing more than to live as a girl.  However, this is not what people in his rural society expect of a little boy.  At a local festival, while awestruck with some traditional dancing that is going on and mostly attended by women, he is entered into a kick boxing tournament that boys at the fair can sign up for, and surprisingly wins his bout.  One thing leads to another and he finds himself in a special school for aspiring kick boxers that is the first rung on a system of schools that feed into the Thai national pastime.  It is not easy for him to fulfill his need to live as a girl and exist, let alone succeed, in a sport strongly tied to a violent male culture.  The movie is about his very public transition as a professional kick boxer and his ultimate fulfillment to live fully as a woman that this career has afforded him.The movie, though, is about a person's public and private struggle to escape the societal rules and conventions that keep him from truly living as the person she is.  It provides a strong life lesson that the only way to become who you are and succeed at life is to be who you are and not to copy others who are successful.  Each must find her or his own path; it is not another's path that will lead to fulfillment.  It is a beautiful film about struggle and acceptance, despair and ultimate triumph.  This movie is uplifting for all, and the fact that it follows a transsexual kick boxer is only the vehicle for exploring these themes.  I found this to be one of the most beautiful and uplifting films that I have seen in a long time.",4,Welcome to a different world!,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,2154,"['first', 'heard', 'person', 'nearly', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'moderating', 'website', 'transsexual', 'athletes', 'One', 'members', 'was', 'Italian', 'woman', 'who', 'boxed', 'Italy', 'transitioned', 'was', 'fascinated', 'what', 'wrote', 'Thai', 'kickboxer', 'who', 'had', 'become', 'champion', 'transitioined', 'read', 'what', 'could', 'web', 'When', 'heard', 'movie', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'very', 'anxious', 'see', 'was', 'not', 'disappointment.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'enough', 'are', 'most', 'impossibly', 'difficult', 'situations', 'life', 'young', 'boy', 'impoverished', 'rural', 'family', 'wishes', 'nothing', 'more', 'live', 'girl', 'However', 'not', 'what', 'people', 'rural', 'society', 'expect', 'little', 'boy', 'local', 'festival', 'awestruck', 'traditional', 'dancing', 'going', 'mostly', 'attended', 'women', 'entered', 'kick', 'boxing', 'tournament', 'fair', 'can', 'sign', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'bout', 'One', 'thing', 'special', 'school', 'aspiring', 'kick', 'boxers', 'first', 'rung', 'system', 'schools', 'feed', 'Thai', 'national', 'pastime', 'not', 'easy', 'fulfill', 'need', 'live', 'girl', 'exist', 'let', 'alone', 'succeed', 'sport', 'strongly', 'tied', 'violent', 'male', 'culture', 'movie', 'very', 'public', 'transition', 'professional', 'kick', 'boxer', 'ultimate', 'fulfillment', 'live', 'fully', 'woman', 'career', 'afforded', 'him.The', 'movie', 'person', 'public', 'private', 'struggle', 'escape', 'societal', 'rules', 'conventions', 'keep', 'truly', 'living', 'person', 'strong', 'life', 'lesson', 'only', 'way', 'become', 'who', 'are', 'succeed', 'life', 'be', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'copy', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'successful', 'must', 'find', 'own', 'path', 'not', 'path', 'will', 'lead', 'fulfillment', 'beautiful', 'film', 'struggle', 'acceptance', 'despair', 'ultimate', 'triumph', 'movie', 'uplifting', 'fact', 'transsexual', 'kick', 'boxer', 'only', 'vehicle', 'exploring', 'themes', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'uplifting', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time']",Beautiful Boxer
