932821,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000ASDFEA,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 1]","I'm beginning to realize the joy that is Independent Film now and I can add `Dot the i' to my list of favorites.  What drew me to the film in the first place was Gael Garcia Bernal; an actor who I've heard raves about yet have not had the privilege to watch.  After seeing this film I am determined to see his previous films ASAP.  I knew nothing of the plot before indulging in this film so I was all the more blown away as the pieces started to fit.  The direction this film takes is absorbing, giving you just enough to keep you curious and suspecting, but never enough to really tell all.  I will admit I thought I had this all figured out and I was starting to get irritated because if I were right then the movie would have been a waste, but luckily I was dead wrong, and that made the ending so much more enjoyable.The story, or as much as I can tell you, takes place in London and is about a young woman named Carmen (Natalia Verbeke) who is engaged to marry a rich Englishman named Barnaby (James D'Arcy).  On her Hen Night (Bachelorette Party) she keeps the French tradition (since she's dining in a French restaurant) of kissing on last boy before she's wed.  That boy is Kit (Gael Garcia Bernal).  The only problem is their kiss is far more than a passing peck but it starts a fire in each of them leading to a passionate affair that threatens Carmen's stable life with Barnaby.  As the film progresses each of the three involved are given reason to suspect something ominous from the others, to where none of them can really be trusted because all of them are hiding something.The acting in this movie I thought was done very well, Gael being a believably romantic lead and commanding his role, but he was no match for Natalia's fire and ferocity.  She was brilliantly cast as the young heroine who is hiding a dark past.  I was also impressed with D'Arcy for I felt he really became his character, especially in the end when all is revealed (won't say anymore for I feel this movie will lose all its vitality if the ending is prematurely revealed).  All in all I was whole heartedly pleased by this film, from its script to its acting to its direction, everything was done brilliantly and just cemented the fact that IF are worth their weight.",5,"Smart, racy and unpredictable...everything you'd ever want in a movie...",1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,2257,"[""'m"", 'beginning', 'realize', 'joy', 'Independent', 'Film', 'now', 'can', 'add', 'i', 'list', 'favorites', 'What', 'drew', 'film', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'actor', 'who', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'about', 'yet', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'privilege', 'watch', 'seeing', 'film', 'am', 'determined', 'see', 'previous', 'films', 'ASAP', 'knew', 'nothing', 'plot', 'indulging', 'film', 'so', 'was', 'more', 'blown', 'away', 'pieces', 'started', 'fit', 'direction', 'film', 'absorbing', 'giving', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'curious', 'suspecting', 'never', 'enough', 'really', 'tell', 'will', 'admit', 'thought', 'had', 'all', 'figured', 'out', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'irritated', 'were', 'right', 'then', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'waste', 'luckily', 'was', 'dead', 'wrong', 'made', 'ending', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable.The', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'tell', 'place', 'London', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Carmen', 'Natalia', 'Verbeke', 'who', 'engaged', 'marry', 'rich', 'Englishman', 'named', 'Barnaby', 'James', ""D'Arcy"", 'Hen', 'Night', 'Bachelorette', 'Party', 'French', 'tradition', 'dining', 'French', 'restaurant', 'kissing', 'last', 'boy', 'wed.', 'boy', 'Kit', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'only', 'problem', 'kiss', 'far', 'more', 'passing', 'peck', 'fire', 'leading', 'passionate', 'affair', 'Carmen', 'stable', 'life', 'Barnaby', 'film', 'three', 'involved', 'are', 'given', 'reason', 'suspect', 'something', 'ominous', 'others', 'where', 'none', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'trusted', 'are', 'hiding', 'something.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'Gael', 'being', 'believably', 'romantic', 'lead', 'commanding', 'role', 'was', 'match', 'Natalia', 'fire', 'ferocity', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'cast', 'young', 'heroine', 'who', 'hiding', 'dark', 'past', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', ""D'Arcy"", 'felt', 'really', 'became', 'character', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'revealed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore', 'feel', 'movie', 'will', 'lose', 'vitality', 'ending', 'prematurely', 'revealed', 'was', 'whole', 'heartedly', 'pleased', 'film', 'script', 'acting', 'direction', 'everything', 'was', 'done', 'brilliantly', 'just', 'cemented', 'fact', 'IF', 'are', 'worth', 'weight']",N/A

932824,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000ASDFEA,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","DOT THE I has so much going for it that it is sad to ultimately feel disappointed at film's end.  Even as one who loves the strange and bizarre in cinema, this viewer opted out of the credibility game as the film turns from a subtle evaluation of relationships, commitments, initial physical attraction, and interesting push pull stance placed on the heroine of the story into a rapid fire series of plot twists and convolutions that simply become silly.But the good parts: Carmen (Natalia Verbeke, and Argentinean actress who is beautiful to look at but difficult to understand  through her accent) is at a hen party in a restaurant, and is challenged to choose the last man she will ever kiss before her upcoming marriage to wealthy and handsome Barnaby (James D'Arcy).  She looks around the table and chooses the down and out Brazilian actor Kit (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal, one of today's most exciting and sensual young actors) as her target. They kiss and that kiss is videotaped by Kit's two buddies who apparently tape everything that catches their interest.This long kiss begins uncontrolled passion between Carmen and Kit and when their affair is discovered by Barnaby the plot turns.  From this point on Carmen's allegiance to either Kit's passionate nature and Barnaby's promise of the good life cause problems.  And the plot falls apart.  It seems everything about these people is on videotape and the whole question of privacy in this current world of intrusion is vividly portrayed!  But the 'suicides', threats, games, and every conceivable plot twist occurs making the viewer ultimately not really care about any of the three characters.Matthew Parkhill has skills and vision. His camera work and pacing are really fine and he allows his actors to flesh out their roles well. There is a fine chemistry between Bernal and Verbeke: with Bernal on the screen it would be difficult for there not to be!  But this film feels like a boardroom project with everybody's vote on how to end the story included as a photographed option.

""A New Yorker""","[0, 1]","Having seen most of Bernal's films, I've grown to like him greatly as an actor, thus explaining my motivation for picking this up. I think this is the first English speaking film Gael has done and that I've seen. On the first scene when he open his mouth I was taking aback because I wasn't use to him speaking English with an English accent to top it all off. I won't lie it took some getting use too; to me he sounded okay but it wasn't the best.In this film his character is up for causing some mischief in this romantic thriller. Kit (Gael Bernal) plays a Brazilian immigrant living in London. He works odd jobs until he is provided a most fortunate opportunity. Carmen (Verbeke) moves to London to escape a troublesome past in Spain. Carmen falls in love with Barnaby (D'Arcy), a local Londoner, who eventually proposes marriage. The three end up crossing paths throughout the plot.Personally, I find the romantic drama as a genre in dire need of a wake-up call. Films such as this one, `Closer,' `Unfaithful', `Wicker Park,' and very few others, are daring to attempt something original, whether it be a more frank look at relationships, a less clich&eacute;d or sexist view of infidelity, or a new take on the love triangle... and by new I mean new in both this film and `Wicker Park.' Rather than recycle `Shakespeare,' `Jane Austen,' or `An Affair To Remember' for the thousandth time, the director and cast has broke some new ground on this.The efforts on direction is good, well, that style of combining the footage in film and the one extracted from a camcorder, wasn't really good, you will learn near the end of the film that is justified but again, didn't feel neat when you see it. The budget for this film is low; you can easily guess that, especially in that Indie Film Festival scene when you realize that you are seeing another indie movie that couldn't make thinks work with its own money, because seriously, that festival looked fake.

The cover of the film says ""This Years Memento"" and I'd say that's a fair statement although this movie isn't quite as good as that movie. The thing I respected about this movie was that once your handed the first twist, you think you know what's going on. Then they throw something else at you and you've got it figured out. But they have one last thing in store before it reaches its end. The movie stars Gael Garcia Bernal as Kit, an enemployed actor who lives in France and meets Carmen (Natalia Verbeke) at her Bachelorette Party. Due to an French tradition, Carmen has to pick a man in the restaurant to kiss. Her last kiss as a free woman. Carmen picks Kit and shares a kiss that makes her rethink her marriage completely. Carmen's fiancee Barnaby (James D'Arcy) is worried about what's going on with his beautiful fiancee, as Carmen (semi-reluctantly) starts an affair with Kit. The movie is really entertaining to a point where you're reluctant to get up.

I am on this foreign/independent film kick utilizing netflix to the best of it's Foreign and Independent Film Library ability. :) that being said on to my review.Everyone that has left a review before me pretty much breaks it down so I won't bother with that but I will agree with someone else who said this movie is a ""ode""  to independent film makers as well as just how far ""reality TV"" can go. The first few frames of the movie is all telling you may think that they are just showing random interesting locations but it is very well done how they pull it all together at the end. The clever use of cameras and camcorders in this movie is as much a part of the plot as the words and actions of the actors. The story/plot itself seems familiar enough.... love triangle,  girl gets engaged to rich boy, girl meets someone more passionate, girl keeps running into the more passionate boy, fianc&eacute;'s finds out yada yada yada.... at times this movie hints at some underlying thriller {tones} Carmen has a past boyfriend that was psycho to whom she believes is perhaps in London stalking her.I gave the movie 4 stars because it surprised me, there were times (towards the end) where I sat in front of my TV angry at the actions of one of the actors and then I was clapping my hands when something was pulled off with such ingenuity, yet less than 10 minutes later. In this day and age where you are HARDLY ever surprised or that a movie will make you feel such varying emotions in the span of your hour and 30 minutes I can't recommend this one enough. Also the young actress that played Carmen (totally reminds me of a spanish/latina Brittany Murphy) did a OUTSTANDING job relaying her emotions as well as the gentleman that played Barnaby her fianc&eacute;.

932839,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000ASDFEA,Tsuyoshi,"[11, 16]","'Dot the I' is a UK/Spanish romantic thriller made in 2003.  It features Gael Garcia Bernal ('The Motercycle Diaries'), James D'arcy ('Master and Commnader') and Natalia Verbeke ('Jump Tomorrow'), and is written and directed by first-timer Matthew Parkhill.  Gael Garcia Bernal, one of the hottest star now, would draw many audiences to this film, but most impressive is Natalia Verbeke and her passionate acting (she was born in Buenos Aires but later moved to Spain).[THE STORY] is set in today's London.  It starts as a traditional love triangle situation.  Kit (Bernal) unemployed actor from Brazil, is watching a Spanish girl Carmen (Verbeke) at the latter's ""hen party.""  Carmen is going to marry a rich English boy Barnaby (D'arcy) soon, and as she is asked to give one last kiss to a total stranger, she chooses Kit, and kisses him on the lip.  And she kisses a bit too long.The boy Kit later shows up before her, as you expect him to do, and despite her rejection, he keeps coming back to her.  He is nice, strikingly handsome, and perhaps a better choice for a future husband.  But ... the story sounds too familiar, isn't it?Actually, underneath this story, another story is going on, and in the middle of STORY A, there suddenly appears STORY B that has been hiding behind A.  Sorry that I cannot reveal the nature of that B STORY which is, quite frankly, incredible and even preposterous, but still enetrtaining in its own way.  This is the most important point because some of you will no doubt  dismiss 'Dot the I' as sheer nonsense, and that kind of negative reactions are understandable.Probably you will be watching the same version of the film as I watched in Japan, so let me add several things about the language.  Because of the roles they play, both Gael Garcia Bernal and Natalia Verbeke speak in English even when their characters speak to each other.  I myself is not a good English speaker, so I don't know how you think about this decision, but their conversations sound strange to me, not because of their accents.  Maybe that's because we know Bernal was born in Mexico, Verbeke in Argentina, so naturally we think -- why not let them speak in their native language?As to Gael Garcia Bernal's acting, I must say it is not his best.  The same goes to James D'arcy (who is slightly overacting).  We have seen their better works elsewhere, but considering the thin characters they are playing, you cannot blame them.  And anyway you soon realise that Natalia Verbeke (with sensual dancing) is a real find here, on the way to be the next Penelope Cruz and Paz Vega.The photography, dark and full of nuance, is provided by Affonso Besto ('Live Flesh' 'All About My Mother'), and a jazz number 'Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps' is used very effctively.  But though the story is really surprising, it makes no sense at all except that the director is dying to surprise us.  Psychological study?  Maybe, but honestly, I don't believe none of us will act like those characters do even though we are 'just bored.'But I admit that the director has considerable talent to create the mood and atmosphere that is required to make a good love romance story.  So my three star rating is based on the leading lady's presence, and that mood.  But the story?  It need more details to convince us.",3,Romantic Thriller Starring Gael Garcia Bernal & James D'arcy,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,3301,"['UK/Spanish', 'romantic', 'thriller', 'made', '2003', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Motercycle', 'Diaries', 'James', ""D'arcy"", ""'Master"", 'Commnader', 'Natalia', 'Verbeke', 'Tomorrow', 'written', 'directed', 'first-timer', 'Matthew', 'Parkhill', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'one', 'hottest', 'star', 'now', 'would', 'draw', 'many', 'audiences', 'film', 'most', 'impressive', 'Natalia', 'Verbeke', 'passionate', 'acting', 'was', 'born', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'later', 'moved', 'Spain', '[', 'THE', 'STORY', ']', 'set', 'today', 'London', 'traditional', 'love', 'triangle', 'situation', 'Kit', 'Bernal', 'unemployed', 'actor', 'Brazil', 'watching', 'Spanish', 'girl', 'Carmen', 'Verbeke', 'latter', 'party', 'Carmen', 'going', 'marry', 'rich', 'English', 'boy', 'Barnaby', ""D'arcy"", 'soon', 'asked', 'give', 'one', 'last', 'kiss', 'total', 'stranger', 'Kit', 'lip', 'bit', 'too', 'long.The', 'boy', 'Kit', 'later', 'up', 'expect', 'do', 'rejection', 'coming', 'back', 'nice', 'strikingly', 'handsome', 'perhaps', 'better', 'choice', 'future', 'husband', 'story', 'too', 'familiar', ""n't"", 'Actually', 'story', 'story', 'going', 'middle', 'STORY', 'A', 'suddenly', 'STORY', 'B', 'been', 'hiding', 'A', 'Sorry', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'nature', 'B', 'STORY', 'quite', 'frankly', 'incredible', 'even', 'preposterous', 'still', 'enetrtaining', 'own', 'way', 'most', 'important', 'point', 'will', 'doubt', 'dismiss', 'sheer', 'nonsense', 'kind', 'negative', 'reactions', 'are', 'understandable.Probably', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'same', 'version', 'film', 'watched', 'Japan', 'so', 'let', 'add', 'several', 'things', 'language', 'roles', 'play', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Natalia', 'Verbeke', 'speak', 'English', 'even', 'when', 'characters', 'speak', 'other', 'not', 'good', 'English', 'speaker', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'think', 'decision', 'conversations', 'sound', 'strange', 'not', 'accents', 'Maybe', 'know', 'Bernal', 'was', 'born', 'Mexico', 'Verbeke', 'Argentina', 'so', 'naturally', 'think', 'why', 'not', 'let', 'speak', 'native', 'language', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'acting', 'must', 'say', 'not', 'best', 'same', 'James', ""D'arcy"", 'who', 'slightly', 'overacting', 'have', 'seen', 'better', 'works', 'elsewhere', 'considering', 'thin', 'characters', 'are', 'playing', 'can', 'not', 'blame', 'anyway', 'soon', 'realise', 'Natalia', 'Verbeke', 'sensual', 'dancing', 'real', 'find', 'here', 'way', 'be', 'next', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Paz', 'Vega.The', 'photography', 'dark', 'full', 'nuance', 'provided', 'Affonso', 'Besto', ""'Live"", 'Flesh', ""'All"", 'My', 'Mother', 'jazz', 'number', ""'Perhaps"", 'Perhaps', 'Perhaps', 'used', 'very', 'effctively', 'story', 'really', 'surprising', 'sense', 'director', 'dying', 'surprise', 'Psychological', 'study', 'Maybe', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'none', 'will', 'act', 'characters', 'do', 'even', 'are', ""'just"", 'bored', 'admit', 'director', 'considerable', 'talent', 'create', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'required', 'make', 'good', 'love', 'romance', 'story', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'based', 'leading', 'lady', 'presence', 'mood', 'story', 'need', 'more', 'details', 'convince']",N/A
