Honestly, when I was done watching it, I had the heebie-geebies!  Don't let the PG-13 rating throw you off. I thought how sacry can a PG-13 movies be?  Boy was I proven wrong.This is a true story about a team of ghost hunters that go into a haunted mansion and just the tapes roll.  What you see actually happens.What I liked is how the start you get a backgroud of the person who owned the house and the horrific things that she did to her slaves.It starts off slow at first (slow but interesting), then all hell breakes lose.  It all comes to a scary climax when the team tries to clense the house, but there is just problem...the ghost (charles...and there could be more there) don't want to leave.I can't say enough good things about this movie.When you see this, you must do two thigns....don't turn out the lights, and don't see this when yer alone in the house.",5,"Scary, scary, scary.",977961600,"12 28, 2000",2000,954,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'low', 'rating', 'movie', 'recieved', 'was', 'sooo', 'scary', 'Honestly', 'when', 'was', 'done', 'watching', 'had', 'heebie-geebies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'throw', 'thought', 'how', 'sacry', 'can', 'PG-13', 'movies', 'be', 'Boy', 'was', 'proven', 'true', 'story', 'team', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'go', 'haunted', 'mansion', 'just', 'tapes', 'roll', 'What', 'see', 'actually', 'happens.What', 'liked', 'how', 'start', 'get', 'backgroud', 'person', 'who', 'owned', 'house', 'horrific', 'things', 'did', 'slaves.It', 'slow', 'first', 'slow', 'interesting', 'then', 'hell', 'breakes', 'lose', 'scary', 'climax', 'when', 'team', 'clense', 'house', 'just', 'problem', 'ghost', 'charles', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'movie.When', 'see', 'must', 'do', 'two', 'thigns', '.do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'lights', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'when', 'yer', 'alone', 'house']",The St. Francisville Experiment

This movie is annoying as it spends so much time setting up the scare that when the actual terror part  of the movie starts you are so frustrated that you no longer care what happens. A good story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. The beginning is over-long even though it does have some spooky ghost stories. The middle with the amateur ghostbusters  exploring the haunted house is at best preposterous. The ending is rushed and offers few answers.

560238,A3DSTOJPRMV674,B00004YS97,"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[12, 14]","You have to love a good ghost story to enjoy ""The St. Francisville Experiment,"" a rehash of the immensely popular ""Blair Witch Project"" which came out the year before in 1999. Both films are pseudo documentaries filmed by annoying youngsters who set out to crack the mystery of ominous old legends. In both cases, the kids start their respective expeditions confident and self-assured, hand-held cameras jerking about while they spout wisecracks at the nearest shadows. Eventually, the kids end up terrified, surrounded by supernatural forces they could never have imagined.I consider ""The Blair Witch Project"" to be a modern-day horror classic, well acted and perfectly executed. It frightened me, and I enjoyed the fact that the monsters could never quite be seen. The filmmakers caught lightning in a bottle, and when they released its fiercely mediocre sequel a couple of years later, it was apparent the magic was gone.There is some magic in ""The St. Francisville Experiment,"" but it is still inferior to ""The Blair Witch Project"" in almost every way. The acting is forced, the locale at a supposed haunted house in Louisiana is only slightly eerie, and the conclusion is never believable. And yet there's a scene, when a ghostly specter makes an appearance, that will definitely give you the creeps. It's all fun, and perhaps the young at heart will get a kick out of this carnival ride.Four kids, including a filmmaker, historian, psychic and the obligatory ""team leader,"" decide to spend the night in a haunted house. Prior to the big bash, the history of the house is documented. Somehow, and none too convincingly, they connect the house's history with the infamous New Orleans' legend of Madame LaLaurie. An 1830s Creole socialite who lived in the French Quarter, her house supposedly burned down and discovered within was a torture chamber where she conducted hideous experiments on slaves. She fled New Orleans in the middle of the night and, according to this film, eventually holed up in the secluded St. Francisville home.The Madame LaLaurie legend, the Grand Guignol of New Orleans ghost stories, has never been convincingly proven, though it has been recited for over 100 years. I actually enjoyed the fact that ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" attempted to connect its story with this most famous of urban legends. The tale is as creepy as the set-up for ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and unlike the latter film, the legend is at least partially based on fact.The kids arrive in the middle of the night, enter the house and begin exploring its interior. The house is certainly authentic, but it's apparent that at least someone arrives on a regular basis to dust and clean its interior. But never mind. Closets are explored, a seance is conducted and a chair flies across the attic - and it all works for the most part. My problem at this point is the growing fear of the actors. Their hyperventilating terror is never convincing and it is abundantly clear they are mimicking the very good performances from ""The Blair Witch Project."" Additional secrets are discovered, including hidden chambers, but I realized I could have just as well bought a ticket to a Halloween funhouse for the same scares.The beauty of ""The Blair Witch Project"" was that during its frantic running time, there was never a moment of doubt. Certainly the documentary was fabricated, but it was always convincing. I was never convinced by ""The St. Francisville Experiment."" Had the filmmakers spent a bit more time with their idea, they could have struck a nerve. There is always something unsettling about an old abandoned house, similar to what was seen during the final moments of ""The Blair Witch Project."" But the house used in this film, even with its hidden chambers and old furniture, looks like a display at the local museum.It took a great amount of skill and imagination to pull off ""The Blair Witch Project."" There were so many missteps that could have been taken. None were. ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" lumbers around and makes these very mistakes. We see chains falling, chairs flying and ghosts hovering within mirrors. I liked the ghost, but the film leaves little to the imagination, and thus its authenticity is compromised.

560239,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00004YS97,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","You have to go way back to the early days of the found footage genre for The St. Francisville Experiment, which emerged in 2000, just a year after The Blair Witch Project put this type of filmmaking on the map.  It is, of course, difficult to follow in the immediate footsteps of the phenomenon that was Blair Witch (just like at how incredibly crappy the official sequel was), but I think The St. Francisville Experiment hit on a pretty good formula.  The film starts out as a documentary of sorts, where we meet the main characters and get the historical context of the &#8220;experiment,&#8221; which culminates in a group of four young people spending the night in what is reputed to be one of the most haunted of houses in the most haunted of towns.  That historical context, it must be noted, does come from the actual annals of history.  The name Marie Delphine LaLaurie doesn&#8217;t conjure up the anything fearful for most people these days, but this prominent New Orleans socialite of the early 19th century more than earned a spot on the list of most depraved serial killers by torturing and killing an unknown number of slaves.  Her crimes tended to be exaggerated as the years went by, but the woman was truly one sick puppy.Only when an aged cook Madam LaLaurie had chained to the kitchen stove attempted to kill herself by starting a fire were this serial killer&#8217;s dark secrets discovered &#8211; in the form of several slaves found horribly mutilated and tortured &#8211; yet still alive.  Soon thereafter, a mob of people, incensed at LaLaurie&#8217;s brutal treatment of her slaves, violently attacked the residence.  LaLaurie herself, unfortunately, managed to escape the mob and most likely made her way to Paris (no one really knows where she went or what happened to her).  Purely for the purposes of this movie, though, it is rumored that she actually settled in St. Francisville, Louisiana.  That sets the stage for the story.Supposedly, this was originally supposed to be a real documentary about the investigation of a real haunted house, which explains why real ghost hunter Troy Taylor turns up to demonstrate the different pieces of ghost hunting equipment the designated investigators will use.  Somewhere along the line, though, that original idea &#8211; for better or for worst &#8211; was scrapped.  Enter the four young people chosen to participate in this experiment: Paul, looking to authenticate some of his own ghostly encounters; Tim, the film student who is basically there for the filmmaking experience; Ryan, a female history student who gets spooked easily; and Madison, a psychic and true believer who feels it is her mission to free the ghosts residing in the house.  The acting is surprisingly good overall for such a low-budget film (250 grand), and the interplay between characters feels natural.  A lot of viewers find Madison annoying; she can be loud, she talks a lot, and she&#8217;s always going on about white light and protecting themselves.  She&#8217;s really the only person who takes the whole investigation seriously (and appreciates the possible dangers) from the beginning, though, so it makes sense to me that she would behave the way she does.The movie never really generates any real scares, but it does have its creepy moments (as well as one unforgettably gross scene) &#8211; and it doesn&#8217;t screw up everything that came before with a lame ending.

560247,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00004YS97,Jeffrey Leach,"[8, 11]","The success of ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1999 virtually assured a few other people would rush out, with video cameras firmly in hand, in an attempt to ride a similar wave to fame and fortune. Who can blame them? The two guys who made ""Blair Witch"" laughed all the way to the bank, I think, although I don't know how much they made off the film. I suspect the people responsible for ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" didn't necessarily laugh as much as they chuckled faintly to the nearest money lending institution. You see, this film is a blatant rip-off of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" right down to real people playing themselves as the characters, an ancient ghostly presence haunting a location (in this case a house), and the final ""horrific"" denouement as the characters encounter something definitely not of this world. The best thing about ""Blair Witch"" wasn't the film itself but the absolutely chilling pseudo-documentary that aired on the Sci-Fi Channel before the film arrived in theaters. ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" tries something similar by telling us the history of who supposedly haunts the house.According to the slightly interesting introductory segment, the spirit of Madame LaLaurie has been causing quite a stir. Who is Madame LaLaurie? Some lady who tortured slaves back in the nineteenth century before disappearing after a fire exposed her nefarious crimes to society. Yeah, that Madame LaLaurie. The movie fills us in on all the gory details just so we know the ghost of this infernal creature could cause a lot of nasty problems for those sticking their noses where they don't belong. Then we get on to the movie, as four annoying dimwits set off to investigate a house supposedly haunted by this spirit--or something like that. The characters include a psychically sensitive woman named Madison Charap, the team leader Paul Cason, ""videographer"" Tim Thompson, and a female historian named Ryan Larson. All of these young people go trooping into this house with a bunch of food, cameras, and other necessary equipment to capture their experiences. They also go in at night since we all know ghosts will never, ever come out during daylight. Locked inside for the night, the team must wander around the house and record their impressions. They don't get started right away because they have to spend a lot of time mooning around in the first room they enter.Nonetheless, weird stuff starts happening after awhile. Anything you can think of associated with a haunting turns up in this movie. You've got cold spots, voices, noises, bangings, and doors opening and closing. You also get chains falling out of chimneys, bloodstained tools found in a chest in the basement, something sinister wrapped up in a cloth in an armoire, and the famous chair flying across the room. The chair scene alone seems to consume an enormous amount of screen time, as the four researchers must hover around the camera to rewatch the chair moving under its own power, talk about the spiritual implications of such a disturbing incident for what feels like hours, and then must go back up to the attic where the whole thing took place. We even see a bug crawling out of someone's sandwich and a cat jumping out to scare everyone senseless. The conclusion to the film sees all four split up for their own personal encounters with the spirits plaguing this house. Are all of these events related to a sinister spiritual manifestation? Sure they are since this film claims that everything we see is the absolute, irrefutable, uncontested truth. Who are we to argue otherwise? More importantly, who are YOU to argue otherwise?Very little works in ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" beyond the nifty chair gag and perhaps selected segments of the ending. Let's begin and end with the four airheads involved in the ""experiment."" Other viewers are correct in asserting that Madison Charap, she of the white light and other crackpot bunkum, is assuredly the most annoying human being presently living on this mortal coil. Move over, Meg Ryan. Step aside, Britney Spears. Hit the road, Mariah Carey. There's a new sheriff in town and her name is Madison Charap. That grating tone, that constant intonation to surround oneself with white light, that emphasis on feeling what's going on around oneself; these are the things uttered by this raven haired dipstick that had me reaching for a heavy yet easily tossed object. Sadly, none of the other three present a viable alternative to Charap's dithering. Ryan shrieks and screams so much I thought her foot was caught in a bear trap. The two male members of the crew are nothing compared to the two prancing clowns named Larson and Charap. I would like to personally thank the ghosts for tormenting these four yucks. Rest in peace now, spirits; you have done well. Move toward the light!The most significant liability in ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" is the performances, but the house itself isn't all that scary. When the young people walked in, I expected a grungy, dingy, spooky atmosphere--and what we see is a fully furnished house replete with furniture, draperies, fully made beds, and a working electrical system. I kept expecting the residents to come in the front door from a night out demanding to know why these people were poking around their abode. Since the whole ""film"" is supposedly true in every way, it's nice the distributors included a batch of trailers for other real life films like ""Crocodile,"" ""Octopus,"" and ""Storm of the Century."" We also get a little featurette on how to conduct your own ghost hunting expedition.

Of course, I wasn't really expecting anything more than a &quot;Blair Witch&quot; rip-off, which is what it was.I think what made the movie particularly funny was the fact that it tried to pass the events off as real, even though it was obviously set up.  Well, first of all, the characters, four twenty-somethings, were overly annoying.  You have your typical blonde &quot;Britney Spears&quot;-type girl who screams and cries unnecessarily at everything, and the so-called &quot;psychic&quot; girl who wants to surround everything in a Bright White Light.  Really, she reminded me of Molly Shannon's character on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;'s Goth Talk, which made it all the more hilarious.And the two guys were typical you-have-an-opinion-you-must-be-on-your-period jerks.  I was almost rooting for the ghosts to put this foursome out of their misery.The other thing that made this film unbelieveable was the fact that they sent four idiots to do a serious investigation.  Every time a simple draft or noise occurred, they jumped at shadows.  Seriously--you feed a group of young, idiotic people with ghost stories and put them in a supposedly haunted house all night to look for ghosts, and they're going to see something.  It's called group hysteria, which is a real thing.Maybe if they hadn't tried to pass off the film as real it might have worked better for me.  As I said before, it was obviously set up.  I mean, first of all, that chandelier falls the first time they turn on a light switch--and half the time, they walk around the rooms with flashlights, mysteriously forgetting about a little thing called electricity.I mean, the whole movie is just so cheesey that it's ridiculous.  The ending is particularly hokey, but I'm not going to give it away in case you decide to watch it.I think the only real interesting part is the story about that society matron in New Orleans, and about what she did to her servants.  That was a genuinely creepy story.The rest of the movie, however, is pretty much a joke.

It feels produced, but scarier because it wasn't made by some kids in the forest who don't know the first thing about suspense (or in their case, improvisation).If you're looking for a fun way to kill a friday night, give it a whirl.

Yes, it was designed ( and that's how I think of it: designed ) to mimmick the success of The Blair Witch Project. However, it is not a bad little movie. There were moments that were genuinely scary. I know it's even less real than The Blair Witch but if you watch it with an open mind you'll probably have a good time. If you hated The Blair Witch and thought it was a hokey piece of garbage you'll hate this one even more and turn it off in disgust five minutes in. If you thought The Blair Witch was the best horror movie ever made then you might want to watch this movie on a dark and stormy night... This movie is proof that sometimes you have to look good and hard on your video store's shelves to find a satisfingly creepy movie.",4,I Like All The Ghosts,1023408000,"06 7, 2002",2002,819,"['loved', 'Blair', 'Witch', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie.This', 'pleasant', 'little', 'movie', 'Yes', 'was', 'designed', 'how', 'think', 'designed', 'mimmick', 'success', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'However', 'not', 'bad', 'little', 'movie', 'were', 'moments', 'were', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'know', 'even', 'less', 'real', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'hated', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'thought', 'was', 'hokey', 'piece', 'garbage', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'turn', 'off', 'disgust', 'five', 'minutes', 'thought', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'was', 'best', 'horror', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'dark', 'stormy', 'night', 'movie', 'proof', 'sometimes', 'have', 'look', 'good', 'hard', 'video', 'store', 'shelves', 'find', 'satisfingly', 'creepy', 'movie']",The St. Francisville Experiment
