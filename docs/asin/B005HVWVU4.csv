But the first couple of episodes are the cute stuff and the lame like the adult groupies that wants the guy gone but after the dumb stuff there are some real serious sceans in this one that will tug at the heart strings. There is some nudity but not gross nudity out of nowhere it is actually in good taste. Would not let my 11 year old watch it but it is definately one that will stay in my collection.

But they are not here with swords and armor, no they are here with suitcases and cameras.  Welcome to your new neighborhood where humans, gods (who have elf ears), and demons (their ears look like Ryoko of Tenchii fame) all live in peace.  Hoever for Rin, who is the target of a group of people because he lives with the most desirable girl in girl (Kaede) known as the KKK (knights to kiss Kaede, not the ones in hoods), does not care.  But when two transfer students arrive things get interesting.  Not only are they the daughters of the Kings for gods (Sia)and demons (Nerine), but both say they are engaged to Rin.  Then add to the fact that they are his neighbors really throws things loopy, as the fathers try to force Rin to choose between them.  Add another cute demoness (Naru) and his childhood friend (Aya), can Rin actually make a decision on who he loves, or will he go mad in the process.I bought all the disks when they first came out and this is one of my favorite shows.  It is more adult (light to mid Ecchii (partial nudity, topless scenes, panty shots galore)) then most harem comedies, but it does have a very good story which needed the full 24 episodes.  The characters are well developed and well liked, and each one has a story and a dark secret that when you watch it compells you to keep watching (especially Naru and Kaede's).  When you get to the end, there is no plot lines hanging, but it did leave an opening that could bring out a new season or series (though after all these years it might not happen), but of course the end choice could have you yelling at Rin.

1461296,A27BN7M1N93SIE,B005HVWVU4,bozeman1941,"[12, 13]","I have been very impressed with a number of anime series I have seen lately (Kanon, Love Hina, Chobits, K-On!, Strike Witches, Angel Beats, Clannad and especially Ah! My Goddess!), but Shuffle! rates up there with the best of them! It is lovable, heart-warming, cute, sad at times, funny (with mostly embarrassing humour involving underwear!) and just leaves you wanting more. It has some fanservice (panty shots etc.,) but not too much.The story follows 17 year old student Rin Tsuchimi, who lives with friend Kaede Fuyou and her father (who is almost always away on business) since the death 8 years earlier of both his parents and her mother in the same car crash. They are like brother and sister, and Kaede loves looking after Rin, whom she is secretly in love with. They are both in the same class at high school, along with friends Lisianthus, aka Sia, Nerine (also known as Rina), Asa Shigure (who is known by her tendency to slap Rin hard on the back in greeting, much to his chagrin), Mayumi Thyme, who is noted for her flat chest, although she is very pretty; she is very self-conscious about this, and not unknown for beating to a pulp any male who comments on the fact! Also part of the story are pretty youngster Primula (known as Rimu, or Rimu-chan), who turns up looking for her 'big sis' Nerine, and Eustoma and Forbesii, the fathers of Sia and Nerine, who both regularly embarrass the daylights out of their respective daughters, Sia particularly tending to get violent and hit her dad over the head with a chair when that happens! Last of the girls is Kareha, who has a tendency to sigh and go gooey-eyed whenever she sees anything she thinks is 'cute'! The only other male character in the proceedings is Rin's friend Itsuki Midoriba, who is an idiot, and tries to get the girls to go out with him using the most preposterous methods, which always fail. Only once in the entire series does he have anything wise or worthwhile to say. Last of all is their home-room teacher Nadeshiko Benibara, who is single, very attractive, and totally fed up with most men's attempts to pick her up (in one episode she confides in one of the girls, saying to her 'Where are all the good guys? They are mostly already taken, and I get left with the idiots!).The actual storyline comes down to the fact that most of the girls (who are all gorgeous, and mostly kind and intelligent) are in love with Rin, who is a kind, caring guy, and known for going out of his way to help anyone, often to his own hurt. Each of them wants to 'land' him, and he dates each of them over time. The backgrounds (some of which are extremely sad and heartbreaking) of each are covered in flashback, and the resulting events vary from cute, funny and awkward to very painful. I won't say any more in case I spoil things, but suffice it to say I was totally riveted from beginning to end; I'm just sorry it finished! You totally get to feel like you know and love these guys; I felt a real wrench when it was over, but it is a lovely story, and the feelings it stirred in me stayed with me for ages.

It does contain some brief nudity, but this was plot-driven, never giving the impression that it was added simply for the benefit of pubescent male viewers. Even the obligatory panty-shots are done humorously, and could offend only the most prudish viewer.The problems I had with the series fall into two categories. Firstly, there was very little personality difference between the two girls who were supposedly competing for the hand of the hero, and there was almost no tension between them. Both seemed to prefer sulking in silence when they felt neglected or ignored. Compare this to what is probably my all-time favorite series in this genre, Rosario + Vampire, where the girls are more than willing to fight (literally tooth and nail) for their &#34;share&#34; of the hero. My other main issue with Shuffle has to do with later plot elements, most of which seemed to have come from ideas the writers got between the first and second seasons, with the result that it seemed patchwork.The ultimate test of a series of any kind is if one wishes it wouldn't end--or at least that the ending given is soul-satisfying.

Is that love? The guy is plain and simply...a cad...the lowest scum.He gets this nice girl to basically take care of all of his chores while he's out busy playing match making with other girls. I know it's a harem anime but I feel like this anime, the main guy is just a punk that likes everything handed to him. Kind and pretty girls, a brainless tool as his maid, and even has other people setting up dates for him. They love him for his kindness, but he's basically playing possum while all of these girls are working so hard to please him.And then there's the fathers that are giving the thumbs up to this whole ordeal.

Typical nice guy that's good to every girl that he sees, closet pervert, a best guy friend that is the comedic relief, and some brainless beauties.If you want to date all these girls, move out of Kaede's (girl that's been taking care of him since he was young while he's busy playing match making with other girls) house and stop using her like that you bum.

What follows is a typical anime story about a guy all of a sudden having a bunch of girls liking him, but turns into a bunch of crazy events at the end.While the main story is about the girl the main character has to choose in the end, it's also about the side adventures they get into. A lot of the characters in this series have more than meets the eye quality to them, and it's fun to try and figure out what's going on with each of them.The animation is nicely drawn with attention paid to their surroundings, and it's kind of cool to see the types of ears ""Demons"" and ""Gods"" have. I like the detail they gave to each character; it really shows off their personality. The music fits the anime well, and I like it.This is another Anime that Netflix provided streamers to watch, and while its average at the start, the crazy plot twists and the choices the main character makes at the end make this well worth watching. If you don't watch it on Netflix it's usually pretty cheap and would be a nice addition to any Anime collection.

I must admit I almost quit half way through.  You have ample opportunity for magic and comedy but there isnt much of either.  Instead I found a anime soap opera with the rare glimpse of skin.  From reading the description I had hoped for more but hey I took a chance.  So here is what I liked and disliked about it.Like:The music isnt irritating but the kittens they used at the cut were horrible.The anime is well drawm using lights and darks to change the tone.There was some skin and it was drawn well.The background of each girl is done seperately.  This gives the watcher time to decide on the girl they like best.  Making it to this point takes around 400 minutes of the 600 minute series.Like the ending or not it actually ended and the plot was resolved.  He chooses a girl.Disliked:The main character is a brainless pushover doing whatever the girls tell him to.  He goes with anything they say.  Its like they tell him what they want and he just goes with it.  ""Girl: hey Ri lets bury you up to your neck in garbage.  Ri: Sounds great.""Fan service is at a minimum.  This is sad because its implied everywhere even in the show itself so many missed opportunities.There is no action or humor.  Usually Harems lead to wacky situations fights between the girls and violence.  Everyone seemed fine with the situation.  Nobody complained or really fought over him.  Some of the girls had magical power but rarely ever used it for any reason.  The small attempts at humor via the KKK fell flat.  In essence this is straight up drama.The first half I neither liked nor disliked any of the characters.  It took so long to find out any background that I almost gave up and quit watching.I guessed which girl correctly before the second disc finished.  There are four DVD's.  It drove me crazy but I watched every episode.Just so you know what your getting into.If you like HAREM-DRAMA, Brief Nudity and a good plot resolution (I say resolution not simply Good Plot.  Its a harem that should tell you the plot right away)  If not the the brief nudity my wife would have watched it like a soap opera.If you prefer HAREM-COMEDY lots of fan service and laughs try something else like Heavens Lost Property or even Rosario+Vampire.I gave this three stars for good reason.  I wasnt looking for a HAREM-DRAMA but I did manage to finish it.

An average Japanese ""everyman"" who is more boring than plain oatmeal becomes the focus of affection for a bevy of beauties and hilarity ensues.He becomes involved in increasingly ""wacky"" hi-jinx while trying to choose a woman out of the litter to spend the rest of his life with. It's usually the first one he meets, or the one with pink hair.I am hear to tell you, you will not find that in this anime. This is a bait and switch. On the cover or the trailer it may appear to be a light-hearted anime comedy. In actuality it is a deep and very emotional drama that is filled with 90% of the characters having unrequited feelings for probably the biggest tool in harem anime history ""Rin Tsuchimi.""I have seen many harem animes and this is the first one that made me hate the main character with a burning rage that I usually reserve for Catelyn Tully or Sansa Stark.Seriously this guy is scum. Not only is he incapable of making a simple decision as ""Which hot girl would you like to be with"" but he spends a good majority of the series treating one character like his personal door mat and then leaving her when she has a mental break down of EPIC proportions.So, if that sounds like something you'd be interested in watching then by all means pick this baby up.
