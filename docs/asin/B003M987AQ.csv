It speaks of the brutality of armed conflict and the effects of war upon every human being--an African woman searching for the skulls of her husband & children, soldiers lying on stretchers waiting for tags which seal their fates, captives shot in front of photojournalists who snap their death agonies.The war zone doctor is harrowingly played by Branco Djuric. All of the actors who play victims of war are realistic and the directing is done expertly. Scenes of beautiful nature are interspersed throughout the shocking scenes of battle brutality. I especially liked the touch of a star-like sun over Kurdistan and then again at the end of the film.Colin Farrell brilliantly plays a photographer who sees horrors through the lens of his camera. He and his best friend (played beautifully by Jamie Sives) go from war zone to war zone, hoping for the best shots to sell to newspapers. Jamie grows sick of it, wants to get home to his pregnant wife (touchingly played by Kelly Reilly). Colin's character, Mark comes home alone, shell shocked, his body brutalized by a mysterious experience. His wife (the spirited Paz Vega) gently washes his body and calls her grandfather for help. She's been estranged from her grandfather for years, due to his role in helping Fascist torturers recover their humanity. Christopher Lee is excellent as Mark's therapist. In his 80s, he is spot on with the complex dialogue between tortured Mark & spiritual doctor. Their journey is rough. The harsh truth comes out at the end, as Mark balances on a roof top, wrenched in heart & soul by what happened back in Kurdistan. I would mark this film up with ""Thin Red Line,"" another genius movie about the beauty of nature, the human spirit & how war affects us all.

1354211,A1UWGR88UD16Z6,B003M987AQ,"Edward Rasen Jr. ""ExecEditor""","[2, 8]","Although an interesting film featuring superb directing and acting, it bombed at the box office and the reason is obvious: the story does not have a hero and the only sympathetic character is Christopher Lee playing a Spanish psychiatrist and grandfather of Colin's wife in the film. Colin Farrell is mesmerizing but don't be blinded by his spectacular performance or ""I Love Colin"" fanfare.Colin's character is an anti-hero, an inconsiderate thrill-seeker who lies to his wife and friends. Ostensibly, this tense drama is about a young, war photographer (Colin Farrell), who returns from Kurdistan during 1988 where he was directly involved in the death of his best friend. Although, the novel and screenplay portray Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the effects on friends and family, the story overlooks the bigger issue: men addicted to thrill, which was much better addressed in the Oscar-winning film Hurt Locker.In reality, Colin's character is just another ego-driven young man, seeking excitement at the expense of his friend and family. He is selfish and irresponsible. Moreover, the film does not delve into the reality of his profession, which is documenting death and destruction. He is simply an an ambulance chaser or war paparazzi. He risks his life for no cause other than making money. There is nothing noble or noteworthy about his work and he pursues it at the expense of others including his wife. In reality, he is an ego-maniac who causes the death of his best friend and then wants absolution for his crime. Moreover, he blatantly lies about the death of his best friend to his wife and and the wife of his friend.Paz Vega is excellent in her role as Colin's wife but like Colin her character is defective and unsympathetic despite superficial appearances. In reality, she is co-dependent, enabling Colin to risk his life simply for thrill. Colin doesn't really love her. He simply uses her. He only loves the thrill of war. Meanwhile, she is too insecure to depart or demand respect. Apparently, she enjoys playing the role of co-dependent mother or nurse.All the actors are superb as is the direction. But, this is a story about a young man without a soul who has to confront reality and doesn't want to accept responsibility for his irresponsible actions. I see a narcissistic young man desperately seeking attention because he was neglected as a child. He is a tragic character incapable of loving others because he is self-consumed. It makes an interesting story but nobody likes a narcissist except himself. It is easy to see why the film bombed at the box office and never made it to general release. The only redeeming quality is the depiction of war, even if a minor conflict in a remote part of world. War is hell but even worse are rebels without a cause who cause others grief and despair simply to gratify their ego.I cannot understand why this film was made. Who was the target audience? What is the message? And who cares about a rebel without a cause? Great acting doesn't save flawed characters or a dramatic story without a message. The cardinal rule of dramatic stories is that you must have a protagonist and antagonist. There must be conflict. This script is like a reality television story more appropriate for Jerry Springer.As as side note, it is interesting how technology has eliminated some jobs. When the novel was written, war photography was still a profession. It is amusing to see Colin carry his 35mm film canisters back to Dublin for processing and then use a slide projector to review his photographs. Those days are long gone as are war photographers, having been replaced by anyone with a cellular phone. The revolutions during 2011 that toppled the government in Tunisia, Hosni Mubarark in Egypt and Muammar Quaddafi in Libya were primarily reported by indigenous fighters with cell phones linked to social-network internet sites.If you watched the overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya, you may remember during the final day of the regime, Alex Crawford of Britain's Sky News riding into Tripoli in the back of a pickup truck with her face illuminated by a laptop computer screen as she talked into the laptop camera. The computer was connected to a small satellite dish, powered by the truck's cigarette lighter plug and linked to her global cellular telephone.",3,Rebel Without A Cause,1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,4325,"['interesting', 'film', 'featuring', 'superb', 'directing', 'acting', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'reason', 'obvious', 'story', 'not', 'have', 'hero', 'only', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'playing', 'Spanish', 'psychiatrist', 'grandfather', 'Colin', 'wife', 'film', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'mesmerizing', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'blinded', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'Love', 'Colin', 'fanfare.Colin', 'character', 'anti-hero', 'inconsiderate', 'thrill-seeker', 'who', 'wife', 'friends', 'Ostensibly', 'tense', 'drama', 'young', 'war', 'photographer', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'Kurdistan', '1988', 'where', 'was', 'directly', 'involved', 'death', 'best', 'friend', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'portray', 'Post', 'Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Disorder', 'PTSD', 'effects', 'friends', 'family', 'story', 'bigger', 'issue', 'men', 'addicted', 'thrill', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'addressed', 'Oscar-winning', 'film', 'Hurt', 'Locker.In', 'reality', 'Colin', 'character', 'just', 'ego-driven', 'young', 'man', 'seeking', 'excitement', 'expense', 'friend', 'family', 'selfish', 'irresponsible', 'Moreover', 'film', 'not', 'delve', 'reality', 'profession', 'documenting', 'death', 'destruction', 'simply', 'ambulance', 'chaser', 'war', 'paparazzi', 'life', 'cause', 'other', 'making', 'money', 'nothing', 'noble', 'noteworthy', 'work', 'expense', 'others', 'including', 'wife', 'reality', 'ego-maniac', 'who', 'death', 'best', 'friend', 'then', 'absolution', 'crime', 'Moreover', 'blatantly', 'death', 'best', 'friend', 'wife', 'wife', 'friend.Paz', 'Vega', 'excellent', 'role', 'Colin', 'wife', 'Colin', 'character', 'defective', 'unsympathetic', 'superficial', 'appearances', 'reality', 'co-dependent', 'enabling', 'Colin', 'risk', 'life', 'simply', 'thrill', 'Colin', ""n't"", 'really', 'love', 'her', 'simply', 'only', 'thrill', 'war', 'Meanwhile', 'too', 'insecure', 'depart', 'demand', 'respect', 'Apparently', 'playing', 'role', 'co-dependent', 'mother', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'direction', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'soul', 'who', 'confront', 'reality', ""n't"", 'want', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'irresponsible', 'actions', 'see', 'narcissistic', 'young', 'man', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'attention', 'was', 'neglected', 'child', 'tragic', 'character', 'incapable', 'loving', 'others', 'self-consumed', 'interesting', 'story', 'nobody', 'narcissist', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'never', 'made', 'general', 'release', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'depiction', 'war', 'even', 'minor', 'conflict', 'remote', 'part', 'world', 'War', 'hell', 'even', 'worse', 'are', 'rebels', 'cause', 'who', 'cause', 'others', 'grief', 'despair', 'simply', 'gratify', 'ego.I', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Who', 'was', 'target', 'audience', 'What', 'message', 'who', 'rebel', 'cause', 'Great', 'acting', ""n't"", 'save', 'flawed', 'characters', 'dramatic', 'story', 'message', 'cardinal', 'rule', 'dramatic', 'stories', 'must', 'have', 'protagonist', 'antagonist', 'must', 'be', 'conflict', 'script', 'reality', 'television', 'story', 'more', 'appropriate', 'Jerry', 'Springer.As', 'side', 'note', 'interesting', 'how', 'technology', 'eliminated', 'jobs', 'When', 'novel', 'was', 'written', 'war', 'photography', 'was', 'still', 'profession', 'amusing', 'see', 'Colin', 'carry', '35mm', 'film', 'canisters', 'back', 'Dublin', 'processing', 'then', 'use', 'slide', 'projector', 'review', 'photographs', 'days', 'are', 'long', 'gone', 'are', 'war', 'photographers', 'having', 'been', 'replaced', 'anyone', 'cellular', 'phone', 'revolutions', '2011', 'toppled', 'government', 'Tunisia', 'Hosni', 'Mubarark', 'Egypt', 'Muammar', 'Quaddafi', 'Libya', 'were', 'primarily', 'reported', 'indigenous', 'fighters', 'cell', 'phones', 'linked', 'social-network', 'internet', 'sites.If', 'watched', 'overthrow', 'Qaddafi', 'Libya', 'may', 'remember', 'final', 'day', 'regime', 'Alex', 'Crawford', 'Britain', 'Sky', 'News', 'riding', 'Tripoli', 'back', 'pickup', 'truck', 'face', 'illuminated', 'laptop', 'computer', 'screen', 'talked', 'laptop', 'camera', 'computer', 'was', 'connected', 'small', 'satellite', 'dish', 'powered', 'truck', 'cigarette', 'lighter', 'plug', 'linked', 'global', 'cellular', 'telephone']",N/A

1354213,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003M987AQ,Grady Harp,"[41, 42]","TRIAGE is a well chosen title for this film about who survives an who dies in war: at times those triage decisions are made by serendipity (read 'bad luck'), at times they are made by physicians or medics tending the wounded on the battlefield, and at times they are submerged in the apparent 'survivors' only to later crush the life from those who make it home.  Writer/Director Danis Tanovic has adapted Scott Anderson's novel  is a manner that carries the seemingly simple act of 'triage' throughout the film, showing how that action can affect the lives of friends, family, and psychological wholeness of the victim.Mark Walsh (Colin Farrell, in yet another powerful role) and his buddy David (Jamie Sives) are war photographers for a newspaper edited by Amy (Juliet Stevenson).  Their current assignment is Kurdistan and the terrifying realities they not only experience but also commit to film are of such a horrid nature that they both are in shock: they not only witness killings and landmine explosion deaths, but they also watch one Dr. Talani (Branko Djuric) triage the wounded, deciding who can survive care and who is so near death that they are put aside to be later 'executed' by Dr. Talani in a compassionate gesture to end their futile suffering.  The tension is so great that David decides to return home, leaving Mark to carry on the assignment.  An explosion occurs and Mark is seriously injured but survives and after being tended by Dr. Talani he is encouraged to return home.  There is no news as to where David is.Mark returns home to his adoring  Elena (Paz Vega), presents his photographs to Amy, and begins to heal: David's wife Diane (Kelly Reilly) is due to deliver their first child in two weeks and has had no word from David.  We watch as Mark, eroded by his experiences in Kurdistan, retreat into a state of decline.  Elena grows fearful as Mark, despite hospitalizations and medical care, continues to deteriorate and out of desperation she calls her grandfather Joaquin, a psychiatrist who treated the victims of the Spanish Civil War (Elena is still angry that her own grandfather treated the perpetrators of the destruction that war caused).  Joaquin slowly brings Mark into the acceptance of how his mind has triaged the events in Kurdistan and leads Mark to discover the truths about incidents in what war for which he has blamed himself.  We finally understand David's disappearance at the moment when his and Diane's child is born.This is a tough story to watch: subtitles would help the audience understand the many dialects used in the film.  But the message is clear and the acting is superb by every member of the cast, even very small but cogent cameos by Reece Ritchie as a boy in Beirut and Dada Ashi as a Ugandan woman - two of the early incidents Mark must remember and face in his work with Joaquin. The cinematography is dazzling, especially the use of flashbacks of a raging river so important in Mark's memory recall, and the constant focus on the blue and yellow tags that mark the triage decisions.  This is another powerful anti-war film, this time as seen through the eyes of a non-combatant observer. It is important to see.  Grady Harp, July 10",4,The Numbing.

He has an excitement about the work he and his partner are doing in Kurdistan and is able to distance himself emotionally for the most part until he becomes more directly involved. His last clear memory of his friend is of an argument they had about David wanting to leave and Mark wanting to stay and work more. Farrell plays well the escalating feelings of guilt and remorse as well as the pain his body has gone through. Farrell got rail-thin for this role making his body painful to look at. He is mentally confused and faces off with Christopher Lee as Elena's grandfather who in the past was a therapist for war criminals (another juicy role for Lee).Paz Vega besides looking beautiful is fantastic at the discovery process that her husband is no longer the man she sent off to war. She is earnest in her demands of Mark and argues her beliefs with her grandfather with a fiery spirit despite asking for his help with Mark.Kelly Reilly's performance as the pregnant Diana is very brave while still occasionally dropping down to show that vulnerability of her fears about whether he'll return.War is always a painful thing to watch and this film focuses mostly on the effects of war on the injured in the field without much in the way of medical care and the families back home of those meant to document, not even fight and how they can get pulled into it. The word ""triage"" means sorting people into groups based on the likelihood that they would benefit from medical treatment based on the severity of their condition which is practiced in the area Mark and David are documenting.This is a pretty decent drama unfolding bits of the missing pieces of the puzzle as it goes along from Mark's memory, but it is also sometimes hard to watch and I would not give it a second viewing.Bonus Features:There is a making-of ""Triage"" feature taken during the filming composed of interviews with the main cast and crew speaking about the book source of the film, the choice of actors, and the director. The ""interviews"" with the cast as a feature are really soundbites of bits of the interview that didn't fold neatly into the making-of feature. Lastly the behind-the-scenes footage is B Roll footage taken of the director and crew getting the actors and scenes ready to shoot without narration or explanation to what is going on. The names of all these bonus features make them sound like more than they really are.",4,Triage delivers great performances from Farrell and Vega in a wartime effects story,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,3031,"['1', 'Disc', 'Blu-Ray', 'released', 'August', '10', '2010', 'Triage', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Danis', 'Tanovic', 'based', 'book', 'Scott', 'Anderson', 'story', 'place', '1988', 'when', 'Mark', 'Walsh', 'played', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'friend', 'colleague', 'David', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Sives', 'travel', 'Kurdistan', 'take', 'war', 'photography', 'Mark', 'injured', 'process', 'home', 'wife', 'Elena', 'Morales', 'played', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'David', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Diane', 'played', 'Kelly', 'Reilly', 'case', 'PTSD', 'incomplete', 'memory', 'what', 'happened.This', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'best', 'performances', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'often', 'tortured', 'photographer', 'excitement', 'work', 'partner', 'are', 'doing', 'Kurdistan', 'able', 'distance', 'emotionally', 'most', 'part', 'more', 'directly', 'involved', 'last', 'clear', 'memory', 'friend', 'argument', 'had', 'David', 'wanting', 'leave', 'Mark', 'wanting', 'stay', 'work', 'more', 'Farrell', 'well', 'escalating', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'remorse', 'as', 'well', 'pain', 'body', 'gone', 'Farrell', 'got', 'rail-thin', 'role', 'making', 'body', 'painful', 'look', 'mentally', 'confused', 'off', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Elena', 'grandfather', 'who', 'past', 'was', 'therapist', 'war', 'criminals', 'juicy', 'role', 'Lee', '.Paz', 'Vega', 'looking', 'beautiful', 'fantastic', 'discovery', 'process', 'husband', 'no', 'longer', 'man', 'sent', 'off', 'war', 'earnest', 'demands', 'Mark', 'beliefs', 'grandfather', 'fiery', 'spirit', 'asking', 'help', 'Mark.Kelly', 'Reilly', 'performance', 'pregnant', 'Diana', 'very', 'brave', 'still', 'occasionally', 'dropping', 'down', 'show', 'vulnerability', 'fears', ""'ll"", 'return.War', 'always', 'painful', 'thing', 'watch', 'film', 'mostly', 'effects', 'war', 'injured', 'field', 'much', 'way', 'medical', 'care', 'families', 'back', 'home', 'meant', 'document', 'not', 'even', 'fight', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'pulled', 'word', 'triage', 'sorting', 'people', 'groups', 'based', 'likelihood', 'would', 'benefit', 'medical', 'treatment', 'based', 'severity', 'condition', 'practiced', 'area', 'Mark', 'David', 'are', 'documenting.This', 'pretty', 'decent', 'drama', 'unfolding', 'bits', 'missing', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'along', 'Mark', 'memory', 'also', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'watch', 'would', 'not', 'give', 'second', 'viewing.Bonus', 'Features', 'making-of', 'Triage', 'feature', 'taken', 'filming', 'composed', 'interviews', 'main', 'cast', 'crew', 'speaking', 'book', 'source', 'film', 'choice', 'actors', 'director', 'interviews', 'cast', 'feature', 'are', 'really', 'soundbites', 'bits', 'interview', 'did', ""n't"", 'fold', 'neatly', 'making-of', 'feature', 'Lastly', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'B', 'Roll', 'footage', 'taken', 'director', 'crew', 'getting', 'actors', 'scenes', 'ready', 'shoot', 'narration', 'explanation', 'what', 'going', 'names', 'bonus', 'features', 'make', 'sound', 'more', 'really', 'are']",N/A

They are long time friends. David's wife (Kelly Reilly) is expecting. During the photographing, David loses his stomach for the war zone and decides to turn back while Mark keeps on working on his Pulitzer. Mark gets badly injured and manages to limp home after being in a Kurdish field hospital for a few days, one where the doctor has limited resources and regularly performs mercy killings. When Mark arrives home, David who left before him isn't there and Mark is acting strange, a case of PTSD.Christopher Lee, feigning a Spanish accent acts as a psychologist to get to the truth, one that most viewers should have already figured out.Having never been in a war zone, or know anyone who has PTSD, I couldn't relate to the movie as well as someone in that situation. For them, I am sure this film has more meaning. I found the film to be slow moving. Christopher Lee and Colin Farrell were not convincing in their roles. I didn't like the constant crying piano sound track. I don't feel the film really deals with PTSD, but rather exploits it to create a mediocre film. Unless you want to watch a film that deals specifically with PTSD, I would suggest something else.F-bomb, groping, nudity (Colin Farrell)",2,HE REALLY ISN'T WELL,1338508800,"06 1, 2012",2012,1336,"['Mark', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'David', 'Jim', 'Sives', 'are', 'war', 'photographers', 'working', 'Kurdistan', 'war', 'Iraq', '1988', 'are', 'long', 'time', 'friends', 'David', 'wife', 'Kelly', 'Reilly', 'expecting', 'photographing', 'David', 'stomach', 'war', 'zone', 'turn', 'back', 'Mark', 'working', 'Pulitzer', 'Mark', 'badly', 'injured', 'manages', 'limp', 'home', 'being', 'Kurdish', 'field', 'hospital', 'few', 'days', 'one', 'where', 'doctor', 'limited', 'resources', 'regularly', 'performs', 'mercy', 'killings', 'When', 'Mark', 'home', 'David', 'who', 'left', ""n't"", 'Mark', 'acting', 'strange', 'case', 'PTSD.Christopher', 'Lee', 'feigning', 'Spanish', 'accent', 'acts', 'psychologist', 'get', 'truth', 'one', 'most', 'viewers', 'should', 'have', 'already', 'figured', 'out.Having', 'never', 'been', 'war', 'zone', 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'PTSD', 'could', ""n't"", 'relate', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'someone', 'situation', 'am', 'sure', 'film', 'more', 'meaning', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'slow', 'moving', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'were', 'not', 'convincing', 'roles', 'did', ""n't"", 'constant', 'crying', 'piano', 'sound', 'track', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'really', 'PTSD', 'rather', 'create', 'mediocre', 'film', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'specifically', 'PTSD', 'would', 'suggest', 'something', 'else.F-bomb', 'groping', 'nudity', 'Colin', 'Farrell']",N/A
