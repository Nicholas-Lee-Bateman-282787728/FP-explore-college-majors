Second, I love how some people absolutely hate this movie and the portrayal it gives for couples with kids. However, devil's advocate, this is truly how some couples come off to people that decide not to have children, or do it in a non conventional way. It's true that children change the dynamics of a relationship. Having seen both sides, i can honestly say that if you're not with someone that you truly like, not just love, but truly truly like and the friendship is not the foundation of your relationship, then it all goes to hell in a handbag when the kids come along. There are parents that coexist roommate style out of obligation just because kids are in the picture. That's one couple we see. Then the other couple do truly like each other, relationship is not perfect and parenthood is certainly challenging, but they press on in the best way possible. It's not pretty, but it's real. As for the main characters, it starts off as a bright idea and slowly turns into what the hec is going on here? I love Jennifer Westfeldt in about anything. Her characters are virtually all the same in all of her movies and she has a quirky endearing style that you'll either love or hate. The supporting cast was well done and the movie all around was more 3.5 stars for me, rather than 4. There are serious opinions here from ppl who have kids and are offended by the portrayal. Maybe you're some of the few that are pressing on in the right way but trust me, there are a ton more out there ( I work with 3) that make it seem like having children totally kills your marriage in every way possible. Congratulations to anyone who does it properly despite the challenges and be thankful you're not part of the percentages that don't. This movie was not laugh out loud funny, way too many F bombs for my liking ( do people really curse that much?? Really?) however keep in mind people, this movie was rated R so expect it.

1532911,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B007L6VMDK,California Dreaming,"[0, 2]","I'm a really big fan of Woody Allen.  Who isn't?  If you live in America, and you like cimema - but don't like Woody Allen - then I think that you just need to think about it some more, and watch some more of his films.  Eventually, you will become a fan as well.  If you don't, well, I just have to say that I believe that you just don't really love cinema.  My opinion and I'm sticking with it.Why am I talking about Mr. Allen when I'm reviewing a movie that (presumably) he had no association with?  Well, I've also watched a lot of Jennifer Westfeldt's films, and I like almost all of them.  And her writing style reminds me alot of Mr. Allen's:  funny, dialog-based, and poignant.  And thought-provoking while being entertaining.  Not many writers can accomplish all of these things, and Mr. Allen and Ms. Westfeldt are two that come to mind immediately for me.One minor difference:  Ms. Westfeldt's films - at least lately - tend to have an ending that the viewer sees coming, while still allowing the film to be excellent and not feel cookie cutter; while Mr. Allen tends to have endings where the protagonist doesn't always get exactly what he wants - maybe not even what we want - but that protagonist is still at least mildly content at the end.  I like both styles.  I do find Ms. Westfeldt's dialog actually more believable than Mr. Allen's; not to dis on Woody of course.  He's just a hyper version of reality, kind of like Kevin Smith (or vice versa, more like it, as Mr. Smith was certainly influenced by Woody as well.)You can read about the plot all you want, but I won't give any of that away.  I always like to discuss themes instead.  One of those themes is similar to the film ""Friend's with Benefits,"" although this film is far superior of course.  Basically, that theme might be something like:  ""You can't have a relationships-lite.  You'll always have to be all in or out.  It's a rule of the universe.""I could go five on this film, I liked it almost that much.  But I usually reserve that rating for films such as ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Yeah, different genres for sure.  But I'm not exactly sure that your life will be changed after watching this film, not that that's a bad thing.",4,Ms. Westfeldt does it again!,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,2208,"[""'m"", 'really', 'big', 'fan', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Who', ""n't"", 'live', 'America', 'like', 'cimema', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'then', 'think', 'just', 'need', 'think', 'more', 'watch', 'more', 'films', 'Eventually', 'will', 'become', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'well', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'believe', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'love', 'cinema', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'it.Why', 'am', 'talking', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'when', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'movie', 'presumably', 'had', 'association', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'also', 'watched', 'lot', 'Jennifer', 'Westfeldt', 'films', 'like', 'almost', 'writing', 'style', 'alot', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'funny', 'dialog-based', 'poignant', 'thought-provoking', 'being', 'entertaining', 'Not', 'many', 'writers', 'can', 'accomplish', 'things', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'Ms.', 'Westfeldt', 'are', 'two', 'come', 'mind', 'immediately', 'me.One', 'minor', 'difference', 'Ms.', 'Westfeldt', 'films', 'least', 'lately', 'tend', 'have', 'ending', 'viewer', 'coming', 'still', 'allowing', 'film', 'be', 'excellent', 'not', 'feel', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'have', 'endings', 'where', 'protagonist', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'exactly', 'what', 'maybe', 'not', 'even', 'what', 'want', 'protagonist', 'still', 'least', 'mildly', 'content', 'end', 'styles', 'do', 'find', 'Ms.', 'Westfeldt', 'dialog', 'actually', 'more', 'believable', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'not', 'dis', 'Woody', 'course', 'just', 'hyper', 'version', 'reality', 'kind', 'like', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'vice', 'versa', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'was', 'certainly', 'influenced', 'Woody', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'read', 'plot', 'want', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'always', 'discuss', 'themes', 'instead', 'One', 'themes', 'similar', 'film', 'Friend', 'Benefits', 'film', 'far', 'superior', 'course', 'Basically', 'theme', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'relationships-lite', ""'ll"", 'always', 'have', 'be', 'rule', 'universe', 'could', 'go', 'five', 'film', 'liked', 'almost', 'much', 'usually', 'reserve', 'rating', 'films', 'such', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Yeah', 'different', 'genres', 'sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'changed', 'watching', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'thing']",N/A

The concept is interesting. The script had really cool moments. The camera work and sound recording was spot on.Friends With Kids starts off a bit strange but interesting. Jason is in bed, his phone rings and it is Julie. As the conversation goes on, it is clear Jason is sleeping with somebody and he and Julie have some kind of very strange relationship. Trying to not spoil the film, the scene is cut away to Jason and Julie in a restaurant with their friends. They are self absorbed young New Yorkers. The film starts to telegraph where it is going with everybody complaining about children in the restaurant.Essentially this is a will they get together or won't they get together film. Unfortunately what happens next is always predictable about ten minutes before it happens. This is a horribly predictable film. There is also a fairly offensive element to this film. After watching the film, I would have predicted that the director was male. There are a lot of really offensive moments in this film. There is no nudity; none of the sex scenes are explicit. What is offensive is worse than having explicit sex and nudity; the dialog goes way south so many times. I decided I hated this movie in the last few minutes, what could have been a tender moment, turned into a really stupid moment. It went something like, I'd like to f the s out of you right now and after I f the s out of you, and you aren't blown away, I'll never f the s out of you again. The film ends with the female saying f the s out of me. No the writer and director is none other than Jennifer Westfeldt who played Julie.The cast is wonderful. Jennifer Westfeldt is simply gorgeous as Julie. Jon Hamm is such a pig, a great change from his Mad Man role. Maya Rudolph is so funny as an unhappy wife and mother. Kristen Wiig has that crazy intensity I enjoy. Chris O'Dowd is a funny schlub that really understands Jason. Megan Fox makes an appearance that is absolutely hilarious. To me the weakest character was Jason played by Adam Scott. My problem, he looks and acts too much like Joel McHale. To be believable Jason had to be a ladies man, somebody really slick. Scott is just too normal or guy next door that is funny to be a player. McHale might have pulled it off, but probably not.This is a long film at an hour forty seven minute. It is about 30 minutes too long.The film is rated R for language. There is no violence, no nudity, and no drug use. This film could have very easily been PG-13 by removing the needless F bombs. On the other hand, I can't imagine a younger viewer that wants to watch this film. Honestly, Westfeldt should have just pulled out the stops and made this a hard R rated movie. Instead she tapped danced between the PG-13 and R line.The ending ruined this film for me. I felt cheated during the last five minutes.

1532931,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B007L6VMDK,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 1]","Actress Jennifer Westfeldt may be known for her roles in the film ""Kissing Jessica Stein"", """"Keep Your Distance"" and TV series such as ""24&#8243; and ""Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place"", but in the 2011 ensemble comedy, Westfeldt also functions as the film's director, writer and producer.The film was inspired when both Jennifer and her partner, actor Jon Hamm (""Mad Men"", ""Sucker Punch"") noticed that friends who started to have families would slowly disappear from their lives.  So, Jennifer went on to craft the screenplay and ""Friends with Kids"" would eventually be created.""Friends with Kids"" would star Jennifer, Hamm, Adam Scott (""Step Brothers"", ""Aviator"", ""Knocked Up""), Kristen Wiig (""Bridesmaids"", ""Saturday Night Live""), Maya Rudolph (""Bridesmaids"", ""Saturday Night Live""), Chris O'Dowd (""Bridesmaids"", ""Pirate Radio"", ""The IT Crowd""), Megan Fox (""Transformers"", ""Jennifer's Body"", ""Jonah Hex"") and Edward Burns (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Brothers McMullen"", ""She's the One"").VIDEO:""Friends with Kids"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  The picture quality of this independent film is rather good. Colors are vibrant when they need to be, scenes are well-lit and skin tones are natural and black levels are nice and deep.  The details are good during character close-ups but overall, the film looks very good on Blu-ray.  I saw no artifacting, no sign of excessive DNR, ""Friends with Kids"" looks great!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Friends with Kids"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  As one would expect from a relationship comedy, the film is dialogue driven.  Dialogue is crystal clear (as with its musical soundtrack) through the center and front channels.  While there are some scenes with ambiance and utilizing the surround channels, the lossless soundtrack is primarily dialogue.Subtitles are in English and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Friends with Kids"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary with Jennifer Westfeldt, Jon Hamm and cinematographer William Rexer.Making ""Friends with Kids"" - (8:10) Interview with director/writer/producer/actress Jennifer Westfeldt and the cast of ""Friends with Kids"".Adlibs and Bloopers - (11:55) Featuring outtakes with the actors and the actors with children.Scene 42: Anatomy of a Gag - (5:06) The only scene which allowed for improv, featuring optional audio commentary with Jennifer Westfeldt and Jon Hamm.MJ Rocks at Video Games - (3:49) A featurette of scene showing how good Megan Fox is at video games (And how bad Adam Scott is with video games) with optional audio commentary with Jennifer Westfeldt and Jon Hamm.Story - Featuring an intro by Laurie Metcalf (1:01) and the trailer of the film ""Treasure Planet"" was inspired from, ""Treasure Island"" (2:08)Deleted Scenes - (8:17) Featuring eight deleted scenes with optional commentary by Jennifer Westfeldt and Jon Hamm.JUDGMENT CALL:For anyone in their adult years, those who have had this unique circle of friends and started to see them disappear, this is the life of a married couple with children.""Friends with Kids"" is a film inspired by Jennifer Westfeldt and Jon Hamm's own personal experience of seeing their friends disappear because they went on to start their own family.  But what is most intriguing about the film is how it's honest about showcasing these friends who have their lives change because of children.  Some for the good, some for the worst.Typically in films, we see the happy couple with children or those who divorce because of mid-life crisis or some sort of banality that we are use to seeing so many times in cinema.  But what I enjoyed about ""Friends with Kids"" is getting to the nitty gritty of the situation.  Situations that many of us probably have seen with friends, friends' friends or family members.In the film, Jennifer Westfeldt as Julie Keller and Adam Scott as Jason Fryman, are two best friends who see their friends disappear because of children.Leslie (as portrayed by Maya Rudolph) and Alex (as portrayed by Chris O'Dowd) are examples of two people in love who are tested with the responsibilities of children.  And this is one, where I know many people have seen and that is two people are good-natured people, transform into emotional (and often angry) people.  It's important for me to say that as there are many people who are loving parents and love having children, there is the juxtaposition of those who become loving parents, but are stressed out and and angry parents.  And no doubt, the introduction of children to a loving couple can bring them closer together or drive them apart.  This couple is naturally angry after having children, but yet they try to make things work.Meanwhile, there is Missy (as portrayed by Kristen Wiig) and her husband Ben (as portrayed by Jon Hamm), this couple were the silent couple.  The couple you would think would stay in love forever.  They are also a couple who are passionate and were very sexual towards each other.  And this is another case that brings out the memories of Al Bundy of ""Married with Children"" that children can easily stifle a sexual relationship for some couples.  In this case, Ben becomes sexually frustrated because his wife is no longer the same woman that would have sex anywhere they go.  Now having a child, she is more reserved and not wanting to have it as much.In most movies, you would see the man have an affair because he isn't getting any.  But ""Friends with kids"" is quite good in showing that buildup of frustration that Ben starts to have towards his wife because she is no longer the sexual plaything that she once was before having a child.  It's a very manly perspective of things but its real.  I've seen, many people have seen it but it's also a divide between how men and women think.  For women, having to have a baby in them for nine months and seeing bringing this new baby into the world but also having changes within their own physical bodies, there is a transformation for some women.  And for men, many don't go through what the women have experienced and so, they think that life can resume as it once was before.As a married man with a child, it's the first thing I get asked about from guy friends who just have had a child.  No it's not questions about the baby (which usually comes up later when the baby is sick, teething or fighting sleep), but the question guys ask are ""will sex be the same?"", ""when should I start asking my wife when to have sex right after having a baby?"".  Always questions about sex after childbirth, followed by the frustrated husband, the guy friends, asking me if its natural to not have sex with their wives as much after childbirth.So, ""Friends with Kids"" is interesting because it explores relationships with couples that have children.But before one thinks that this is a film about couples not doing well after having a child, this is where the protagonists Jason and Julie come in.  While the concept of best friends having sex to have a child, having mutual love for each other but not romantically attracted towards each other, may seem a bit farfetched.  For this film and in the context of this film, it works.I don't know how many times I have met friends, a man and woman, who are best friends and have so much in common, that they are not in relationship.  Jason and Julie are that type. Granted, I know no friends, that were this close, having a baby with each other but I do know it does happen, it is plausible and the performance of Jennifer Westfeldt and Adam Scott feels natural.  The chemistry is good, both work well with each other and its rather fascinating because Westfeldt is wearing many hats in this film as an actress, director, writer and producer.And while I enjoyed the film, I also found it fascinating that four cast members of ""Bridesmaids"" are in this film and it does feature a pretty solid cast. Yes, Megan Fox is in this film, yes she does play the sexy character role but she does a good job playing the girlfriend of Jason, but not into kids at all.  Edward Burns plays the boyfriend of Julie, which was a more subdued character role that was necessary to show that both Jason and Julie are dating or having relationships despite having a child together.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and lossless audio quality was good for a relationship comedy.  Dialogue and music was crystal clear and as for special features, there are a good number of them.  And it was great to hear how passionate Jennifer Westfeldt and her husband, actor Jon Hamm were in making this film.Overall, ""Friends with Kids"" was a different type of relationship comedy that explores single friends and their reaction to their friends, couples who have children.  Concentrating on the changes these couples go through after having a child.  Not many films explore that and that is what I enjoyed ""Friends with Kids"" a lot!""Friends with Kids"" is an honest, delightful, touching comedy that I easily recommend on Blu-ray!",4,"""Friends

1532934,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B007L6VMDK,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 3]","----------------------------------------------------------""Friends With Kids""(Lionsgate, 2012)----------------------------------------------------------NOTE: mild spoilers below----------------------------------------------------------There are, apparently, two kinds of people in the hip urban world: those who sneer at families that bring children to ""fancy"" restaurants, and those who either have kids and lives that include kids, or just plain people who have grown up and aren't clinging to their hip, groovy narcissism. Kudos to writer/director Jennifer Westfeldt for so skillfully exposing this divide, and bringing it out of the shadowy world of snarky interweb chat rooms and onto the silver screen.""Friends With Kids"" is a surprisingly good modern romance film, with edgy humor that is matched by the script's soulfulness and emotional intelligence.  This is sort of a ""chick flick,"" but of the modern variety with acerbic dialogue and plenty of cussing, but also with a strong emotional core, and a real point to make. The movie opens at a fancy restaurant where three couples of footloose yuppie BFFs meet for one of their regular nights on the town. A few tables away there is a family with some slightly noisy children and this of course sets the hipsters off -- breeders!! curse them!! -- until one couple announces (oopsie!) that they are going to have a kid soon. Parenthood enters all their lives and they all deal with it differently.This movie -- written, directed by and starring Jennifer Westfeldt -- has some of the best couples-fighting scenes and she's-just-one-of-the-guys boy-girl dialogue I've seen in a film, and top-notch acting throughout. John Hamm seems like a peripheral character right up until the end when he gets two great scenes -- one loud, the other quiet -- while costars Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd, Adam Scott and Kristen Wiig deliver solid performances as well. The pivotal scene in which Adam Scott's NYC uber-hipster switches teams to play for the adults is wonderfully understated, and decisively flips the script on the self-involved pretty people, using their own language and status symbols to drive home the point that you can be human as well as hip. The dramatic buildup is a little slow, but the payoff is worth it. Recommended!

1532935,A2LFLJG1HPEX3O,B007L6VMDK,EAlves,"[7, 9]","I cannot believe how awful this film was.  Jennifer Westfeldt's real-life partner, Jon Hamm, must have called in a ton of favors both with his former co-stars Wiig, Rudolph and O'Dowd and the studio to see this project come to fruition.Where to begin?  Westfeldt is a terrible actress, as evidenced by her ""work"" in the mediocre ""Kissing Jessica Stein.""  Why, oh why, does she insist on handing lead roles to herself?  Oh, I know - probably because she would never, EVER get cast otherwise.  In addition to her terrible acting, Westfeldt has clearly had some pretty awful plastic surgery on her face; something that has resulted in her absolute inability to show emotion at all (as well as resulted in recurring nightmares for me.)Poor Adam Scott, who I usually like, has zero chemistry with Westfeldt (see: comments on plastic surgery above for partial explanation) and seems to be pretty lost throughout the entire film.The rest of the co-stars also seem lost, bored and/or embarrassed; Wiig is tragically underused, especially.

1532936,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B007L6VMDK,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 7]","Those familiar with Jennifer Westfeldt's previous two films, 2002'sKissing Jessica Steinand 2006'sIra & Abby, already know her as a triple threat - writer, producer and actress - and will no doubt know what is in store for them with her latest picture. The dialogue-heavy 2012 romantic dramedy continues her signature style of combining adroit commentary with awkward revelations, this time within the context of a group of thirtysomething friends feeling the decisive impact of having kids in their relationships with each other. The set-up provides fertile ground for social satire, and Westfeldt shows a sure hand in grappling with her generation's personal dilemmas with a deft hand. What's more, for the first time, she has taken over the directorial reins, and shows talent in maneuvering the actors through each of their character's respective crises. Since half the cast was in last year's break-out hit,Bridesmaids, there may be an expectation of a similar laugh-fest.Yet despite the comic trailer, this film's tone is relatively more serious with laughs thrown in for good measure, something more akin to Ingmar Bergman'sScenes from a Marriageor Woody Allen's more somber movies likeInteriors. The six primary characters are established in a four-years-ago prologue where Westfeldt's character, Julie, sits in a stylish Manhattan restaurant with her intimate circle - her best friend Jason and two couples, Leslie & Alex and Ben & Missy - just as Leslie announces a second child is on its way. Flash forward to the present, and Leslie and Alex live in Brooklyn with their two kids in an apartment that is in total disarray, while Ben and Missy have a baby son and barely speak to each other. Julie starts to feel her biological clock ticking louder, so to the rescue comes Jason who is willing not only to impregnate her but share custody of the baby like a civilized divorced couple.Of course things don't go as conveniently as planned because it's pretty obvious from the outset that Julie and Jason are made for each other. What's intriguing about Westfeldt's approach is that the focus on child rearing starts to recede as each one takes on new relationships. Jason meets Mary Jane, a comely dancer interested in neither having nor raising kids, while Julie gets involved with Kurt who appears for her checklist like the ideal man. This roundelay hits a snag on a group ski trip to Vermont where things start to unravel in quick order before the inevitable finish. Westfeldt writes often sharp dialogue, is generous with her actors, and doesn't mind putting her own character in humiliating places to serve her story. At the same time, the situations are sometimes undercut by a sitcom-level sensibility and reduce the emotional resonance she obviously wants to convey.One definite exception is a harsh, uncomfortable dinner table scene at the Vermont lodge where Ben and Jason have at it over the feasibility of raising a baby separate but equal. The cast is quite solid with some surprisingly effective turns. Kristen Wiig has the smallest, most serious role as Missy who gets subjected to Ben's lacerating diatribes. Ben is played by Westfeldt's long-time partner Jon Hamm (Don Draper onMad Men) who can surely play this type of role in his sleep. Maya Rudolph and a brogue-free Chris O'Dowd have the most comic scenes as put-upon Leslie and horndog Alex. Westfeldt has a quirky awkwardness as Julie that brings to mind early Diane Keaton, while Adam Scott (Parks & Recreation) provides a necessary but alienating bravado to Jason that makes his character's evolution less than arresting. In hindsight, I wish Scott and the more easily likable O'Dowd could have switched roles. As Mary Jane and Kurt, Megan Fox (Transformers) and Edward Burns play to their accustomed types unobtrusively.",4,Westfeldt's Baby-Rearing Roundelay Recalls Serious-Minded Woody Allen,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,3805,"['familiar', 'Jennifer', 'Westfeldt', 'previous', 'two', 'films', ""2002'sKissing"", 'Jessica', 'Steinand', ""2006'sIra"", 'Abby', 'already', 'know', 'triple', 'threat', 'writer', 'producer', 'actress', 'will', 'doubt', 'know', 'what', 'store', 'latest', 'picture', 'dialogue-heavy', '2012', 'romantic', 'dramedy', 'signature', 'style', 'combining', 'adroit', 'commentary', 'awkward', 'revelations', 'time', 'context', 'group', 'thirtysomething', 'friends', 'feeling', 'decisive', 'impact', 'having', 'kids', 'relationships', 'other', 'set-up', 'fertile', 'ground', 'social', 'satire', 'Westfeldt', 'sure', 'hand', 'grappling', 'generation', 'personal', 'dilemmas', 'deft', 'hand', 'What', 'more', 'first', 'time', 'taken', 'over', 'directorial', 'reins', 'talent', 'maneuvering', 'actors', 'character', 'respective', 'crises', 'cast', 'was', 'last', 'year', 'break-out', 'hit', 'Bridesmaids', 'may', 'be', 'expectation', 'similar', 'laugh-fest.Yet', 'comic', 'trailer', 'film', 'tone', 'relatively', 'more', 'serious', 'laughs', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'something', 'more', 'akin', 'Ingmar', ""Bergman'sScenes"", 'Marriageor', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'more', 'somber', 'movies', 'likeInteriors', 'six', 'primary', 'characters', 'are', 'established', 'four-years-ago', 'prologue', 'where', 'Westfeldt', 'character', 'Julie', 'stylish', 'Manhattan', 'restaurant', 'intimate', 'circle', 'best', 'friend', 'Jason', 'two', 'couples', 'Leslie', 'Alex', 'Ben', 'Missy', 'just', 'Leslie', 'second', 'child', 'way', 'Flash', 'forward', 'present', 'Leslie', 'Alex', 'live', 'Brooklyn', 'two', 'kids', 'apartment', 'total', 'disarray', 'Ben', 'Missy', 'have', 'baby', 'son', 'barely', 'speak', 'other', 'Julie', 'feel', 'biological', 'clock', 'ticking', 'louder', 'so', 'rescue', 'Jason', 'who', 'willing', 'not', 'only', 'impregnate', 'share', 'custody', 'baby', 'civilized', 'divorced', 'couple.Of', 'course', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'conveniently', 'planned', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'outset', 'Julie', 'Jason', 'are', 'made', 'other', 'What', 'intriguing', 'Westfeldt', 'approach', 'focus', 'child', 'rearing', 'starts', 'recede', 'one', 'new', 'relationships', 'Jason', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'comely', 'dancer', 'interested', 'having', 'raising', 'kids', 'Julie', 'involved', 'Kurt', 'who', 'checklist', 'ideal', 'man', 'roundelay', 'snag', 'group', 'trip', 'Vermont', 'where', 'things', 'start', 'unravel', 'quick', 'order', 'inevitable', 'finish', 'Westfeldt', 'often', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'generous', 'actors', ""n't"", 'mind', 'putting', 'own', 'character', 'humiliating', 'places', 'serve', 'story', 'same', 'time', 'situations', 'are', 'sometimes', 'undercut', 'sitcom-level', 'sensibility', 'reduce', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'obviously', 'convey.One', 'definite', 'exception', 'harsh', 'uncomfortable', 'dinner', 'table', 'scene', 'Vermont', 'lodge', 'where', 'Ben', 'Jason', 'have', 'feasibility', 'raising', 'baby', 'separate', 'equal', 'cast', 'quite', 'solid', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'turns', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'smallest', 'most', 'serious', 'role', 'Missy', 'who', 'subjected', 'Ben', 'lacerating', 'diatribes', 'Ben', 'played', 'Westfeldt', 'long-time', 'partner', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'Don', 'Draper', 'Men', 'who', 'can', 'surely', 'play', 'type', 'role', 'sleep', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'brogue-free', 'Chris', ""O'Dowd"", 'have', 'most', 'comic', 'scenes', 'put-upon', 'Leslie', 'horndog', 'Alex', 'Westfeldt', 'quirky', 'awkwardness', 'Julie', 'mind', 'early', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'necessary', 'alienating', 'bravado', 'Jason', 'character', 'evolution', 'less', 'arresting', 'hindsight', 'wish', 'Scott', 'more', 'easily', 'likable', ""O'Dowd"", 'could', 'have', 'switched', 'roles', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Kurt', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'Transformers', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'play', 'accustomed', 'types', 'unobtrusively']",N/A

For anyone serious about raising a child in an environment that fosters steady growth to maturity and the wisdom of finding self these movies must offend.  But they bring in money and that seems to be the driver, much like buying the Presidency under the new standard of whoever gets the most money campaigning wins.  It is a sad statement about where we are but explains a lot about why we arrived at this juncture. Put BRIDESMAIDS, HANGOVER I and II, AMERICAN REUNION et al, in a blender and out flows FRIENDS WITH KIDS.Jennifer Westfeldt wrote, directed and stars in this embarrassing tale. Julie (Westfeldt) and Jason (Adam Scott) have been best friends for years with no romantic interest in each other. He sleeps with someone new every few days, and she's looking for Mr. Right. Now in their thirties, they notice that their friends seem to lose all their good qualities when they have children - child rearing and the spark of Eros don't seem to co-exist. Witness the sex in the bathroom and any available space for Ben (Jon Hamm) and Missy (Kristen Wiig) together with Leslie (Maya Rudolph) Alex (Chris O'Dowd): once Ben and Missy get married and have a baby their passion dissipates into a hate game and the child suffers, where as Leslie and Alex fight continually over who is responsible for what with their children and avoid the sex like the plague. Seeing this Jason and Julie decide to have a baby they will share 50/50 with no strings of attraction or sex attached. The baby is born, is a joy - but only as long as the two best friends can continue to explore their own pursuit of the perfect physical and mental partner. Things go well until he meets Mary Jane (Megan Fox) and she meets Kurt (Edward Burns). The ending is completely predictable and pointless.Westfeldt (Jon Hamm's significant other in real life, Hamm having produced this thing) doesn't seem to have a very positive look at child rearing and plays along with `let the child run the household and prepare for entitlement': rarely have relationships between `adults' and children been so off putting. Watching this cast of characters who represent the `beautiful neurotic New Yorker' people has some moments of comedy and tenderness, but the overall effect is much the same as the scene of the baby's multiple diarrhea explosions.

I mean if you are going to watch a 2 hour movie that you know how it's going to end for certain might as well just watch something at least a tad bit entertaining or interesting right? Instead of the same old, same old mindless fluff.*Sigh* Anyhow, Friends with Kids I won't say has THE Most Unpredictable ending. Nothing is THAT Unpredictable in Hollywood hardly anymore *this is not a spoiler* if you have been watching Rom/Com you should know that as a RULE the movie 9 times out of 10 is going to end with the main characters getting together. Really, this movie is such a cookie cutter of a story. The nature of the relationship between the Patrons, the ROMANCE story is not anything that we haven't seen or heard of before. It's been done many times in the past. However, the only reason this movie deserves 4 stars or any mention at my recommendation list is because of the premise and the you can say dry/somehow superior sense of humor and comparison to movies of the same gender of late it is the most noticeable work. The Characters *almost* all of them were likable and realistic. They also acted the same way a person out of real life would've acted not so comical or ridiculous the way they always act in Romantic Comedies. The majority of these people look like your average American family. They could be your friend or your neighbor or a person you know at work or possibly you. You can actually relate to them which I think why this movie is you know easy to like and get into.I liked the concept behind it. I liked the idea behind this movie, the underlying issues.

1532959,A2HRT3AZA2YCDP,B007L6VMDK,James E Geoffrey II,"[2, 4]","The recently released indie rom-com ""Friends with Kids"" purports to be a ""daring"" comedy that ""questions the nature of friendship, family and true love.""  While it is true that the film is marinated in a certain ""anti-establishment in a stereotypical Manhattan sort of way"" ethos, what really makes this film extraordinary is how much it actually celebrates rather old fashioned virtues of love, loyalty and family.  The result is a film that, while it badly stumbles in literally the last few seconds - more about which anon - is remarkably poignant and touching, albeit formulaic.""Friends"" tells the story of Jason (Adam Scott) and Julie (Jenifer Westfeldt), who find that their friends  - couples  Ben (Jon Hamm) and Missy (Kristin Wiig) and Alex (Chris O'Dowd) and Leslie (Maya Rudolph) - have become caught up in married life and the demands of raising kids.  The plot goes pretty much as could be predicted.  Jason and Julie decide to have a baby but not to get married and to continue looking for their ""true loves.""  In due course, Jason meets  Mary Jane (Megan Fox) and Julie meets Kurt (Edward Burns). Of course, in the end, in true rom-com tradition, the audience realizes that Jason and Julie are truly made for each other, and it is only a matter of time before Julie  and Jason realize that for themselves.Formulaic?  Absolutely, but that is not a criticism.  There is a reason for formulas and when they work  - as they do here - they can pack an unexpected dramatic wallop.  What such formulas require is likeable and believeable characters, and this ""Friends with Kids"" delivers.  For sure, they are beautiful Manhattanites who have an almost central casting quality about them.  However, they are more than that.Ben and Missy start as insufferably loving and snarky, but as their marriage begins to disintegrate their agony and bitterness become palpable and it is hard not to feel their pain.  Alex and Leslie are more typically everyman. They shout at each other - albeit with more curse words than you would hear among sailors on a troopship - and argue over the kids and the housework and all the things couples typically fight over, but their genuine love for each other is touching and they bring a reassuring sense of stability to a cast of characters who otherwise seem emotionally untethered.Then, of course, there is Jason and Julie.  The gut level response to both is that they live for little more than the moment and the next night on the town.  However, even before they hatch their grand plan, both show an unexpected humanity.  Jason is shown playing with Alex and Leslie's little boy and seeming to enjoy it.  Julie plays a word game with Jason in which she reveals that she would rather lose her own life than watch someone she loves suffer.  In fact, both are good people who are lost and need each other to find their better selves.  Again formula, but it is hard not to like and root for these characters.In the end, the most striking thing in all of this is how the film thematically takes the audience on a long ride through New York self-satisfaction and, dare we say it, liberalism only to end up reaffirming fairly traditional values.  In a sadly politically conscious age, conservative viewers will wince when Jason denounces  organized religion and George W. Bush, but they shouldn't.  By the film's last reel, Jason and Julie find themselves deciding to be togther with their child in a (more or less) traditional family relationship.  If this is a film that is supposed to queston traditional notions of love and family, it should have come up with a significantly different ending.  It does not, and so what makes it daring is the fact that it tests alternative relationships and finds them wanting.  Whodda  thunk it?The acting in the film is terrific.  No other word applies.  Jon Hamm and Kristin Wiig are agonizingly poignant as the couple whose mariage is falling apart.  The viewer almost wants to look away so painful is Hamm's protrayal of Ben's rising bitterness and unhappiness.  Kristin Wiig's similar handling of Missy's sense of loneliness and abandonment is spot on.  This is not just another typical Hollywood handling of ruined marraiges and ruined lives.  This is painful and biting.By contrast, Maya Rudolph and Chris O'Dowd give the audience a couple who are just instantly likeable because they are so human.  This is no lovey-dovey married couple who stroll arm and arm through life.  They fight. They say dumb things.  They embarrass each other, but still they work on their marriage and actually love each other.  In a similar vein, Ed Burns and Megan Fox, though their characters are far less developed, come across as believeable and certainly work as the outside love interests for Julie and Jason.However,  the highest praise should absolutely go to Jennifer Westfledt and Adam Scott.  Westfeldt, Jon Hamm's real life partner, besides being the film's screenwriter and producer, creates in Julie an absolutely endearing and loveable  - in the literal sense - character.  She is a devoted mother and the viewer can't help but sympathize with her as she comes to the increasing realization that Jason is the real love of her life.  To watch as she falls almost absentmindedly in love and then to see her struggle with that love, is nothing short of powerful.Adam Scott also performs brilliantly. Jason is not as instantly likeble as the more overtly emotional Julie, but  Scott teases this out with effective subtelty.  The viewer sees Jason as being superficially attracted to Mary Jane and it is easy to be dismissive of him as  just another playboy - until you see the real pain and resentment in his face when he thinks that Kurt is getting close to his son.  Suddenly, beneath the cavalier faade is a loving father who instictively resists having some other man in his family's life.  Scott portrays this not just with words but with a masterful control of facial expression and tone of voice.  He proves himself the consummate actor and deserves the highest accolades for his work in the film.Screenwriter Westfeldt, other than perhaps relying a bit too much on a couple of soliloquies to move the plot along, scarcely puts a foot wrong.  The viewer reaches the expected climax where Jason declares his love for Julie and there is a real sense of warmth and humanity that elevates the story above its formula driven expectations.  There is what should be the closing kiss and then...Westfeldt blows it  - and blows it badly.The reviewer's code of conduct forbids revealing the ending of a movie, suffice to say that whole film schools should be dedicated to exploring why Westfeldt so badly mishandled the film's literally final seconds.  It may have been because she thought she could avoid a formula ending.  It may have been that she simply did not appreciate the natural dynamics of the kind of screenplay she was writing - or at least thought that she could avoid them.  It may even be that she simply thought she was just getting a final laugh out of the audience as the movie does tend to veer a bit into sitcom every now and again.Whatever the reason, the effect is to take her redeemed, decent and very human protagonists and reduce them in a split second to superficial, carnal and crude caricatures.  In a film otherwise handled so deftly, it is almost a disaster.  Not ruinous to be sure, but an incredible disappointment that will have the audience leaving the theater befuddled and deflated.  They should be feeling warm and comforted and instead, if anything, they are probably worrying about what kind of upbringing Julie and Jason's son will get from these two rather base human beings, who after all they have been through seem to have ended up only where they started on the emotional maturity scale.Friends with Kids is a good movie that is elevated by the absolutely spectacular acting of its leads.  It is also oddly refreshing in its ""through the back door"" tribute to frankly good old fashioned values of family, love and devotion.  Values not immediately apparent at first viewing given the film's stereotyped Manhattan sensibility.  However, in the last seconds Westfeldt flies too close to the comedic sun and falls to Earth.  So the bottom line is that Friends is absolutely worth seeing, but when the viewer gets to what should be the film's final kiss, he should run, not walk, from the theater.",4,Icarus Makes a

As babies arrive, our two watch the romance go out of those relationships. They both agree that they would like to have a child, but don't want to jeopardize any potential romance. The solution, as they see it, is to conceive a child together, cope with the baby's early demanding year or two as a team, but continue their quest to find their one true love...Yeah, right!We see:* Jennifer Westfield (lots of TV) is our practical heroine. A good friend, a delightful companion and a great mother, so why complicate things?* Adam Scott (""Parks and Recreation"") is her baby's proud daddy.

Jennifer Westfeldt's face held me in morbid fascination - her mouth moves, but the rest of her face remains inert. She tries to speak, but her upper lip curls downward and she appears to be smirking. She is unable to even speak properly as her face has been stretched by so many fillers and Botox that it no longer functions normally. Her face has become a grotesque mask that should serve to horrify anyone considering any of these unnecessary procedures. My husband said she looks like a Muppet.For an actor, this needs to be viewed in the same light as an athlete who decides not to train, or gains a hundred pounds. An actor's job is to emote, to perform, to inhabit a character...If you cannot express yourself because your whole face is frozen and distorted, you should no longer be eligible to be in this profession. It is an insult to the audience. It was shocking, actually - all of us kept commenting on this actress's face, not on her acting ability, the (vapid) dialogue being delivered, or the (ridiculous) storyline.There is a scene in a restaurant where a family is having a meal. The mother turns to the camera and her face is completely unnatural: bloated lips, injected cheekbones, and when she spoke her one line of dialogue, again it was like watching a plastic mannequin. Is this the future? No wonder Meryl Streep and Helen Mirren are still winning awards - that is the ultimate irony: Age normally, and you get to keep your job.You may think these observations are irrelevent, but they are not. If this were a superbly written film, perhaps I could have maintained my focus elsewhere. As it was not - infact, it is insufferably bad - most of my attention latched onto all of the terrible plastic surgery that is going on in Hollywood.

It centers on three men & three women who have apparently been friends forever, and are now in the marriage-with-kids stage. Four of them are coupled up, and the remaining man and women, Jason (played by Adam Scott) and Julie (played by Jennifer Westfeldt) decide to have a child together as friends. Emotionally, this proves to be a lot more complicated than they expected, and in the meantime their couple friends are going through various marital crises related to the challenges of married life.This has a great cast with supporting actors Jon Hamm, Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd, Megan Fox, and Ed Burns. Jennifer Westfeldt wrote and produced it, and knows how to find the emotional guts and humor underlying real-life relationships. This one punches hard in parts, and for the most part that works, although in the climactic dinner scene I felt it went over the top. The ending is a bit abrupt too - we get to see what happens to Jason and Julie, but lose touch with the other couples.

While there were a few moments that made me laugh out loud and some well written banter between the two main characters, the plot is just painful to watch. Before you even get to know the characters they launch into a completely insane plan to plantonically conceive a child and share custody as BFFs. All of their close friends, who they don't even seem that close to, start having kids, and they decided that they should join in.  They completely gloss over the complicating factors involved in having, paying for, and caring for a child, and develop no strategy for how they will raise the little guy as he grows into an adult.  Adam Scott's character, Jason, is also involved in a string of one night stands and relationships lucky to last a week, so I kind of thought that they would mention getting tested for STDs or whether he uses condoms with all these women before he has unprotected sex trying to impregnate his best friend Julie, but no, that is another glossed over detail of their plan. I just could not get into this movie because I can not imagine two friends actually deciding to go ahead with this plan.There is also some strange dialog thrown in occasionally, like when she complains ""I'm sorry I can't afford to pay for half of private school, I'm not a graphic designer like you."" What?! Since when can a graphic designer afford private school? And at the end during what should be the romantic climax of the movie, Adam Scott utters the practically revolting line ""I'm going to f*** the s*** out of you. Just let me f*** the s**** out of you and if you're not convinced afterwards that I am into to you in every possible way, then I promise never to try and kiss you, f*** you, or impregnate you as long as I live.""The only thing good about the movie was the kid they cast to be their child, because he was amazingly cute.",1,Disappointing,1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,1871,"['movie', 'was', 'ludicrous', 'were', 'few', 'moments', 'made', 'loud', 'well', 'written', 'banter', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'plot', 'just', 'painful', 'watch', 'even', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'launch', 'completely', 'insane', 'plan', 'plantonically', 'conceive', 'child', 'share', 'custody', 'BFFs', 'close', 'friends', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'close', 'start', 'having', 'kids', 'decided', 'should', 'join', 'completely', 'gloss', 'complicating', 'factors', 'involved', 'having', 'paying', 'caring', 'child', 'develop', 'strategy', 'how', 'will', 'raise', 'little', 'guy', 'adult', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'character', 'Jason', 'also', 'involved', 'string', 'one', 'night', 'stands', 'relationships', 'lucky', 'last', 'week', 'so', 'kind', 'thought', 'would', 'mention', 'getting', 'tested', 'STDs', 'condoms', 'women', 'unprotected', 'sex', 'trying', 'impregnate', 'best', 'friend', 'Julie', 'glossed', 'detail', 'plan', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'two', 'friends', 'actually', 'deciding', 'go', 'ahead', 'plan.There', 'also', 'strange', 'dialog', 'thrown', 'occasionally', 'when', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'pay', 'half', 'private', 'school', ""'m"", 'not', 'graphic', 'designer', 'What', 'when', 'can', 'graphic', 'designer', 'afford', 'private', 'school', 'end', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'romantic', 'climax', 'movie', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'practically', 'revolting', 'line', ""'m"", 'going', 'f***', 's***', 'Just', 'let', 'f***', 's****', ""'re"", 'not', 'convinced', 'afterwards', 'am', 'possible', 'way', 'then', 'promise', 'never', 'try', 'kiss', 'f***', 'impregnate', 'as', 'long', 'live', 'only', 'thing', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'kid', 'cast', 'be', 'child', 'was', 'amazingly', 'cute']",N/A

Or perhaps one of those 3 couples, 3 stories films that have a common intersection.  Nope.  It is essentially a drama focused on the lives of Jason (Adam Scott) and Julie (Jennifer Westfeldt).Pushing 40 they have been best friends since college.  They live in the same Manhattan apartment building, share the same philosophy, politics and entertainment choices.  They know each other well...but never in a physical way.  Much is made of how they love each other but ""not that way.""  Yeah sure.  Now if one of these two was overweight, unkempt and generally unattractive, maybe.  ""Harry"" and ""Sally"" already figured this out.  But never mind.Their best friends are two other couples that they socialize with often, sometimes together but usually with dates of their own.  When Leslie (Maya Rudolph) and Alex (Chris O'Dowd), followed by Missy (Kristen Wiig) and Ben (Westfeldt's real husband Jon Hamm) begin to have children, lives change.  Jason and Julie want in and decide to have a baby to be shared emotionally and financially but without the battle scars that come with marriage.They decide to do it the old fashion way which is awkward but ultimately successful.  Interestingly, it is never mentioned how many ""tries"" it took to get pregnant.  Once or a hundred might have made a difference in the story don't `ya think?  Ms. Westfeldt is not only the co-lead but wrote and directed.  She does a decent job on all fronts.  I didn't find the movie funny in the way of ""Bridesmaids"" but it was smart and occasionally witty.  As we see the other couple's marriages begin to strain under the weight of parenthood, the movie is mostly serious in tone and full of heartbreak before coming to a predictable but satisfactory conclusion.  I say see it, but don't expect a traditional comedy.This Blu ray 1080p transfer is done with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and looks very good.  The colors pop and the overall clarity is excellent.  Ms. Westfeldt and her cinematograher create visuals that make New York shine.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is likewise excellent.

And so they do. After the baby arrives, they continue their seperate dating lives, while also being confronted with their friends wondering how this can work.The movie works beautifully, that is until the last 15 min. or so. I won't spoil here why, you'll just have to see it for youself how it all works out. I was delighted from start to (almost) finish. Jennifer Westfeldt wrote, produced, directed and stars in this, and what a marvelous job she does at all levels. The movie also stars Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph, who were prominent in ""Bridesmades"" from last year, and by all means, this movie should appeal to anyone who loved that movie.I am baffled by the box office bomb this movie is, to be honest. It is one of the best movies I've seen in the theatres this year (and I see a lot of them). The movie is charming from start to (mostly) end, with lots of interesting observations about married life and having kids.

I have meet friends who would make great couples; from simple things as the ""death game"" than the main characters play, to taste in books, movies and yes even sexual preferences. Anybody that was offended by the ""F the S out"" are really not understanding the premise of the whole scenario; we can be such petty and pathetic people that sometime we get blinded by the wonderful person who actually gets us and loves but maybe we don't feel attracted to them...and sometime all it takes is a not only looking past the ""big breasted iceborader hotie straight out of a teenage fantasy"" but the basic compatibility beyond the whole sexual angle.The Jon Hamm character plays it out simply by saying that great sexual attraction is NOT enough to make a relationship last, and he is correct; in the long run it always end sooner or later, but a relationship based on friendship and common interest and whatever is just as likely NOT to last if there is no physical chemistry, let alone sexual desire. I do understand where those characters are coming from and rather than being offended by the stark raw reality of the characters and the world WE live in, where there is a 60% chance that your marriage is going to fail, even if you are a straight, gay, divorced or whatever relationship and that is why I can look past the movie as a criticism of the oh so holy institution of marriage.I liked the film, it is a smart, thoughtful and frankly at times blunt view of relationships in the 21st century, where there are no set rules or foolproof manuals for doing things; I can under how some could have felt offended by the way the traditional marriage was portrayed but honestly guys, that is how non married people see the whole thing...this is how real people talk, think and live nowadays guys",4,Bold new world...and the relationships in it,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,2056,"['am', 'not', 'married', 'have', 'time', 'time', 'kids', 'arguments', 'main', 'characters', 'having', 'baby', 'sound', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'realistic', '90', '%', 'couple', 'movie', 'garbage', 'usually', 'get', 'praised', 'being', 'realistic', 'heartwarming', 'have', 'meet', 'friends', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'couples', 'simple', 'things', 'death', 'game', 'main', 'characters', 'play', 'taste', 'books', 'movies', 'yes', 'even', 'sexual', 'preferences', 'Anybody', 'was', 'offended', 'F', 'S', 'out', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'understanding', 'premise', 'whole', 'scenario', 'can', 'be', 'such', 'petty', 'pathetic', 'people', 'sometime', 'get', 'blinded', 'wonderful', 'person', 'who', 'actually', 'loves', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'attracted', 'sometime', 'not', 'only', 'looking', 'big', 'breasted', 'iceborader', 'hotie', 'straight', 'teenage', 'fantasy', 'basic', 'compatibility', 'whole', 'sexual', 'angle.The', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'character', 'out', 'simply', 'saying', 'great', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'NOT', 'enough', 'make', 'relationship', 'last', 'correct', 'long', 'run', 'always', 'end', 'sooner', 'later', 'relationship', 'based', 'friendship', 'common', 'interest', 'just', 'as', 'likely', 'NOT', 'last', 'physical', 'chemistry', 'let', 'alone', 'sexual', 'desire', 'do', 'understand', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'coming', 'rather', 'being', 'offended', 'stark', 'raw', 'reality', 'characters', 'world', 'WE', 'live', 'where', '60', '%', 'chance', 'marriage', 'going', 'fail', 'even', 'are', 'straight', 'gay', 'divorced', 'relationship', 'why', 'can', 'look', 'movie', 'criticism', 'oh', 'so', 'holy', 'institution', 'marriage.I', 'liked', 'film', 'smart', 'thoughtful', 'frankly', 'times', 'blunt', 'view', 'relationships', '21st', 'century', 'where', 'are', 'set', 'rules', 'foolproof', 'manuals', 'doing', 'things', 'can', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'felt', 'offended', 'way', 'traditional', 'marriage', 'was', 'portrayed', 'honestly', 'guys', 'how', 'non', 'married', 'people', 'see', 'whole', 'thing', 'how', 'real', 'people', 'talk', 'think', 'live', 'nowadays', 'guys']",N/A

The cast was superb, it was well written, it was well directed and the cinematography was excellent. Apparently some people were put off by the curse words, I wasn't. The conversations seemed perfectly natural and real. To me, these characters were very real, not always pleasant, but most real people aren't perfectly pleasant all the time. If you want practically perfect all the time there's always ""Mary Poppins"". Watching this movie was like getting together with old friends that you haven't seen for a while, time has passed and you have all gone through changes. You discover that some of the people you don't really care for and some you like very much. I liked Julie, (Jennifer Westfeldt), and Jason, (Adam Scott). They have their quirks, but they're good people who obviously care deeply for each other. This a very lovely movie with a less than perfect ending.SPOILER: Julie has given up a terrific guy Kurt, (Ed Burns), because she has realized she is completely in love with her best friend Jason, after Jason has expressed how well he knows her and how much he loves her. When Julie tells Jason that she is completely in love with him and tries to kiss him he backs away and tells her, ""yes I love you, as a friend"", ""I'm not attracted to you"". Julie is devastated and moves to Brooklyn. Jason has been into hot, physical attractions that he always thinks, ""This is the one"" that quickly burn out. He finally matures and realizes what is real and that Julie is the ""one"". He has to convince Julie that he is physically attracted to her after what he said. What he says to her to convince her is not the best choice of words and I was surprised, but I get what the writer was trying to convey, I think it could have been done better.

1533041,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B007L6VMDK,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 1]","Story is an argument by the writer on the best type of couple to raise children, basically people who are friends first is her premise, or more specifically, people who respect, like, and know one another well.  Not a bad idea.  Film was pleasant enough, probably not more engaging because the writer focused primarily on the characters' sex and reproductive lives; we learned almost nothing about them in their work lives, in their extended family lives, or about them as individuals -  so we got too narrow a framework, too little information to form attachments to any of them.  The characters entered the story already partnered up - friends entered the story as friends and the audience had to try to figure out who they were as individuals through their friendship dynamic.  For instance, when the lead said about 5 minutes into the film that she had blown her boss and another man at the nice restaurant in order to get a table, I thought she meant it, and was taken aback by both the behavior and the statement.  It wasn't until I'd seen the film a second time that I understood she was joking, that is how little I knew her; the sex crazed couple were introduced in the story as a sex crazed couple, kinda one note (until they started fighting and broke up); the funniest couple, the slightly older woman, younger man couple, were the funniest because of their honest interaction after they had kids (her yelling at him when he did moronic stuff; the writer showed him doing irritating things and his partner responding in a believable, exasperated manner).  I also didn't care for the vulgar language between the male and female leads associated with sex or sex-related body parts.  This language, which seemed more appropriate to teenagers trying to shock rather than 30+ year olds, pulled me out of the story; their choice of sex words didn't make them seem hip or edgy, just crass; and crass is not appealing.  Instead of wanting to get to know and like them, their offensive language pushed me away from them.  Especially the male lead, who in his Act 2 speech said how much he loved and respected the female lead, yet in his sex-speak when he was alone with her showed a clear lack of respect (referring to her vagina as a p***y when he was angry with her for staying out and not calling).  The female lead liked him, but I did not, and this was entirely due to the writer not understanding how the leads come off to the audience (all the primary actors were good, this is not a criticism of the actors).  Friends with Kids' primary target audience is women, which means the lead male character must be appealing to women.  Having the lead male speak so crudely to the heroine does not make him sexy.  While I understand the lead characters have known one another for 20 years and are best friends, the audience has just met them, and know almost nothing about them.  The writer has got to know that many women are not used to such language from men, and might find it offensive.  If the writer was determined to have the leads speak with casual crudity about sex, then the writer needed to explain why that is okay in the story (the explanation has to be in the fabric of the story, it needs be imbedded in the story); so that when the audience hears the male lead discuss the female lead's p***y, or joke about her getting laid, in front of their toddler, then the target audience might, perhaps, cut him some slack (though that's a tough sell).  Having the leads interact the way they do, without showing the audience why, means there are bound to be women who take offense to the language.  What if a woman wanted to see this movie with her mom, or her grandmother?  The leads share a 20 year history that the audience does not share; it is the writer's job to bridge the gap between the leads and the audience, to make the leads' friendship accessible to the audience, so that the audience can enjoy the leads' banter instead of mentally flinching from it.  The movie is not a fail, but needed more work on characterization; I'd be willing to view the writer's next project and hope she keeps writing.

It doesn't work well and nearly caused me to eject my DVD. It then settles down to a circle of friends, 2 couples plus Jason (Adam Scott) and Julie (Jennifer Westfeldt) who are very close friends who know each other too well to have a sexual relationship.The film flash forwards 4 years. The couples have kids and their lives are in disarray. Julie surmises she wants to have a child, be a divorced mom so she can find the man of her dreams. Her friend Jason agrees to father the child and be ""100% committed 50% of the time."" Things work out as they have a nanny and most important Jason helps out with the child. Their home is neat and clean unlike their married friends. They have an open arrangement and it is time for the soul mates to move on and start dating other people.

1533049,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B007L6VMDK,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 7]","I love independent films. Usually, they tell more personal, heartfelt, interesting, unusual and/or daring stories. Usually, the characters are more real and believable. Usually, the filmmaker is telling a more intimate story, drawing on their own life and what they have learned (or not learned). Basically, independent film can provide an escape from the cookie-cutter fare offered by the studios.I also really liked Jennifer Westfeldt's last film ""Kissing Jessica Stein"". It captured most of the spirit of what a good independent film can do.When I started to hear the buzz about ""Friends With Kids"", Westfeldt's new film as a writer/ director, co-producer and star, I started to get excited. The buzz about the great cast (Jon Hamm - Westfeldt's real boyfriend, Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig, Chris O'Dowd and Adam Scott) seemed to indicate the film would be a home run.The anticipation may have exceeded the actual film. It has some very good moments, but it falters and in the end and doesn't deliver in one key area.I don't really consider myself an old-fashioned person. I really enjoy and seem to embrace films that push boundaries, any boundaries, for the most part, as long as they push these boundaries in a way that works and makes sense to that film. ""Friends With Kids"" is a romantic comedy and it does push a few boundaries. But because of this, it seems less romantic and therefore less successful. Maybe I really need and want my romance films to be more old-fashioned? Maybe I really want and need to see ""The Vow"". Groan. I won't do it. I won't. But when I go to films like ""27 Dresses"", ""The Ugly Truth"" or ""Leap Year"", these don't satisfy either.Six friends living in Manhattan get together on a regular basis. Leslie and Alex (Maya Rudolph and Chris O'Dowd (he played the Irish cop in ""Bridesmaids"") are married and have a child who seems to consume every moment of their time and space. Ben and Missy (Jon Hamm and Kristen Wiig) are married, madly in love and can't understand why anyone would want to have kids and complicate things. Jason and Julie (Adam Scott and Jennifer Westfeldt) are very good, old friends who live in the same building, their apartments floors apart. Flash forward a few months and Ben and Missy now have a child and Leslie and Alex are living in Brooklyn, so the friends see less of each other. They get together at Leslie and Alex's for dinner to celebrate Jason's birthday, but it is a disaster. Everyone starts to fight and Jason and Julie end up at a bar eating birthday cake. Julie's biological clock starts to tick and she mentions to Jason that she really wants to have a kid. Should she go to a sperm bank? Should she look for a donor? Should she try to find Mr. Right? Eventually, they decide to have a kid and share the responsibility of raising the child, wile remaining friends. Their friends insist it will never work. But as they continue to get together, after the birth of their son, Jason and Julie seem to be the only couple who has everything together. Leslie and Alex seem amazed. Ben and Missy seem jealous. Then, Julie and Jason begin dating other people. Jason meets Mary Jane (Megan Fox, ""Transformers 1 & 2"", ""Jennifer's Body"") and Julie meets Kurt (Edward Burns, ""27 Dresses"", ""The Brothers McMullen"", ""Life or Something Like It""). Each of their new loves seems to be perfect and this makes the long time friends jealous.Written, directed and co-starring Jennifer Westfeldt, ""Friends"" really concentrates on the story of Jason and Julie. Because they have been friends for so long, they pretty much know what each other is thinking at any given moment. They really are a couple except they don't live together and they don't have sex. And because Jason is a ladle's man, who seems to have a different woman in his bed every night, they seem to prefer it this way. But Julie thinks nothing of calling Jason in the middle of the night and he doesn't care if a new woman is asleep in his bed, he answers and they talk and deal with each other's issues.Jason and Julie are really amazed when their friends have kids and complicate their lives. When the new parents start to move, to take advantage of larger homes in the other boroughs, cab drives become expensive and prohibitive and their lives are turned upside down. Is it all worth it? Leslie and Alex are the first to have a kid and they seem to be getting through it all right. Sure, their apartment is a mess when the others visit, they fight and argue and have disagreements, but they also share a bond that seems as though it could withstand all of these problems. They are, for me, the most realistic couple, because you can tell that even with all of the problems, they will make it through and live a long and happy life together.Ben and Missy have the least amount of screen time, but also share the most dramatic character arc. Their characters provide a nice counterpoint to everything Julie and Jason are going through, but because they deal with so much, in such a relatively short period of time, they seem oddly under developed. Almost like Cliff Notes of the real thing. They start off promisingly. The film opens with the three couples gathering for dinner at a restaurant. Jason and Julie arrive late to find Leslie and Alex sitting at a table alone. They quickly learn Ben and Missy have gone to the bathroom, to have sex. Later, they have a kid and their relationship goes down hill from there, the very situation Jason and Julie want to avoid.Adam Scott and Westfeldt have a nice chemistry together. They actually appear to be really good friends. Apparently, all six actors have known each other for a number of years, in some combination or other. So when Julie and Jason talk to each other late at night, it seems completely natural and we really get a feeling they know each other very well. When they decide to have the child, but remain platonic, there is a nice, touching moment when they actually go through the process of 'having a kid'. For a long time, the relationship and the arrangement works and they become the envy of their friends.But when they decide to start dating other people, jealousy rears it's ugly head and throws a wrench in the works.Westfeldt seems particularly honest and heartfelt. Adam Scott is really good and convincing as a lothario. Let's face it, he isn't your typical matinee idol (Hamm or even Burns would be the more obvious choice for this role) but he convinces us that he is an extremely popular and wildly successful ladies man. When he first approaches Mary Jane, he seems both confident and shy, making him seem even more irresistible. He also shows us in many ways that he cares very deeply for Julie and their son.There are three major problems with ""Friends"". The first is the casting of Megan Fox and Edward Burns. Fox is actually a good choice and makes her portrayal of Mary Jane really believable. But because the mechanics of the story insist that Jason and Julie will eventually have to get together (Problem #2: For a film that is trying to be more modern, this is a remarkably old-fashioned convention), she has to be 'less' in some way. She is young, they have fantastic sex and they actually seem to care about one another. But Jason must eventually fall out of love with her and this handled in a less than convincing way. On the flip side, when Julie meets Kurt (Burns), they seem to be an interesting mix. But Burns is pretty boring. Sure, he's handsome, but he just seems so vanilla and unexciting. He doesn't seem to ignite passion in Julie, at least in the same way Mary Jane ignites passion in Jason. Julie makes a couple of remarks about him, but we never really witness anything that leaves a lasting memory.The third problem comes from the film's desire to be a modern take on the romantic comedy. At times, this idea works and comes across, at other's it falls very short. When it falls short, it robs the film of any lasting memory of romance. The film seems to confuse what most would consider as being lustful with being in love particularly in the final moments, which I can't really discuss. I want to see people embrace, kiss passionately, more. In ""Friends"", this idea is taken to a more modern level, perhaps an extreme and it just seems to leave a strange taste in the mouth.""Friends With Kids"" has a lot of good stuff going on, a lot to recommend it. But it also has significant problems, robbing it of any lasting impact. Catch a bargain matinee. Anything else will likely leave you feeling unsatisfied.",4,"Some Very Good Moments, But It Falters...",1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,8529,"['love', 'independent', 'films', 'Usually', 'tell', 'more',

1533052,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B007L6VMDK,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[1, 2]","Romantic comedies have been in a weird state of flux for awhile now, as our view on marriage and parenting has been irrevocably altered by the Sex and the City generation. Now more than ever we're seeing less rom-coms anticipating wedded bliss(no more Father of the Brides!), and more featuring New York hipsters with no interest in settling down, and even less desire for the life upheaval that comes with children. This has given birth(pun intended) to a slew of similarly styled comedies featuring pretty people having their cake and eating it, too, like No Strings Attached or Friends with Benefits, or the older skewing It's Complicated.Ten years after she rose to fame with the insightful and often funny Kissing Jessica Stein, Jennifer Westfeldt is standing front and center ahead of a talented supported cast in Friends with Kids, a sharp and witty comedy that shows her understanding of near-middle aged New Yorkers has only become more refined. Her style is delightfully Woody Allen-esque, or maybe like one of Ed Burns' city-set indies. Burns ironically co-stars in the film, along with a cast that would have any studio head salivating. Springing from the ultra successful Bridesmaids are Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd, and Westfeldt's long-time partner, Jon Hamm. Yet it's Westfeldt and Adam Scott who sparkle together on screen and steal the show from their hilarious colleagues.Jason(Scott) and Julie(Westfeldt) are two long time best friends, enveloped in their world of social gatherings and bachelorhood, with no desire to ever see that change. Their closest friends are couples in various states of wedded bliss: Leslie(Rudolph) and Alex(O'Dowd) are chummy and stable. While Ben(Hamm) and Missy(Wiig) can't keep their hands off each other long enough to make it through dinner. As long as they're happy and childless, Jason and Julie are content to sneer at those parents who bring their noisy kids into busy restaurants. But when their friends start popping out the little buggers, forming families of their own, Jason and Julie not only see their carefree world grind to a halt but also feeling the pangs of old age.A few years later, and their friends aren't nearly as happy as they once were. Kids have turned Leslie and Alex's marriage into a gale force wind of chaos, while Missy and Ben don't speak and can't stand one another. Even worse, they're boring! Wanting to have kids but not the deadweight of marriage to burden them, Jason comes up with the ingenious idea for he and Julie to have a kid together, just ""pop one out"" he says, but stay best friends and not get married. It's a terrible idea from the start, and their friends know it as surely as we do.Westfeldt, who also write and directed the film, presents us with a situation that seems ripe for sitcom treatment, but presented in a (mostly) mature and thoughtful way that stands apart from other romantic comedies. In particular, she veers away from the heavily dominated female perspective and focuses equally on the plight of both Jason and Julie, who are rapidly approaching middle age and seeing the prospects of finding ""the one"" dwindling. As Julie, she fits somewhere in between Sex and the City's Carrie Bradshaw and Wiig's character in Bridesmaids. She's a successful, outgoing woman who just can't seem to put it all together on the relationship side of things. It's actually surprising that Wiig wasn't chosen for the lead role, instead set in the background with her usual exuberance quieted. Westfeldt's performance is strong and believable. Even though Julie is a beauty by almost any measure, she has an insecurity about her that feels real, especially after she gives birth. When Jason starts dating the younger and more traditionally sexy Mary Jane, played by Megan Fox, it only exacerbates the situation.Adam Scott is an actor who has been knocking at the door of being a leading man for awhile now, although he's mostly been able to show it on television and the occasional film like Leap Year. His wry attitude and easy charm work wonders opposite Westfeldt, hopefully meaning we'll see him in more roles such as this in the future. With the exception of Wiig, who may have been a tad underutilized, the rest of the supporting cast is terrific. In particular O'Dowd steals literally every scene he's in as Rudolph's ""just go with the flow"" husband. Megan Fox, a better actress than many give her credit for, does her best work when she's not being forced to play the sex pot.Disaster strikes, of course, as Julie and Jason are forced to deal with the realities of raising a kid. That includes babysitters, poopy diapers, and for Julie an horrific realization the effects it has on a woman's body. Some of the talk gets pretty frank, but it sounds natural. While the film does slip into conventional romantic comedy territory as the two best friends continue to deny their obvious attraction, the true impact of their rash decision making is perfectly explored in a tense and revealing dinner scene near the film's conclusion. We're so used to seeing Hamm as the unabashed alpha male in everything he does that it's strange to see him in this scene in particular, as a drunken, angry husband beaten down by life.Those turning up to see Bridesmaids-style will get something completely different, but they won't walk away disappointed.  Westfeldt clearly has a lot to say, and she might be wise to keep her cast together for an even deeper exploration of the rigors of marriage.  Perhaps a spinoff starring O'Dowd and Rudolph?",4,"A smart, insightful comedy for adults",1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,5544,"['Romantic', 'comedies', 'have', 'been', 'weird', 'state', 'flux',
