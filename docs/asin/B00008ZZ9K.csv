Since this movie describes the insights of the WW2 in Tuscan , the Tavianni brothers avoid to describe the physical wounds of the war.They focus on the deep impact on the psiquis and the simple behavior of a simple group of brave people for surviving.The horror you'll breathe for instance, at the church undergrounds, the wedding and the best glorious achievement in the middle of field are simply outstanding. One little girl with his voice in off will make her own journey and will employ her particular justice code against the enemy told in such level of poetic and expressive intensity that when you leave the cinema hall remain mesmerized.Acquire as soon as possible this extraordinary film.",5,One of the three best Italian films of the eighties!,1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,761,"['film', 'real', 'gem', 'Superb', 'loaded', 'cosmic', 'poetry', 'movie', 'insights', 'WW2', 'Tuscan', 'Tavianni', 'brothers', 'avoid', 'describe', 'physical', 'wounds', 'war.They', 'focus', 'deep', 'impact', 'psiquis', 'simple', 'behavior', 'simple', 'group', 'brave', 'people', 'surviving.The', 'horror', ""'ll"", 'breathe', 'instance', 'church', 'wedding', 'best', 'glorious', 'achievement', 'middle', 'field', 'are', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'One', 'little', 'girl', 'voice', 'off', 'will', 'make', 'own', 'journey', 'will', 'employ', 'particular', 'justice', 'code', 'enemy', 'told', 'such', 'level', 'poetic', 'expressive', 'intensity', 'when', 'leave', 'cinema', 'hall', 'remain', 'mesmerized.Acquire', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'extraordinary', 'film']",N/A

Half of the villagers decide to escape, so they sneak out of town to look for the Americans while hiding in wheat fields and fighting fascists.The movie is narrated by a woman who was a six year-old in the little band of townsfolk who escaped the village.  The story is episodic and choppy, juxtaposing scenes that aren't always understandable.  We never get to know any of the townsfolk as individuals; instead, we are overwhelmed with the general misery of war - the deprivation, constant fear, the cruelty, and even some surreal visions.I don't recall seeing a scene of shooting stars and it's annoying to miss the significance of the title. Also, I was often confused as to who was who, but overall, it is quite an effective wartime horror story.

751058,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B00008ZZ9K,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[3, 3]","WWII in Italy was time when polarization was at its greatest.  Fascists have lost the power, but their desire for control was still strong.  In small village in Tuscany, locals are anxious about arrival of allied forces that will prevent destruction of their homes and secure safety from fascists.  Unsure what to do, most villagers have to choose between following the instructions of their local priest vs. following their own heart and intuition.I loved the relationships portrayed between protagonists in this movie: young mother trying to protect her daughter (a narrator of this story), old couple who missed out on being married 40 years ago due to social norms of the time, virgin empowered with knowing that men of all ages desire her; young man trying to protect his pregnanat bride due to deliver their first child in any moment.  All characters are real in their all too human fears, desires and fight for survival.Story is told by a woman who experienced all this as a 6 year old child, now a mother herself.  She tells this story to her young son during the night of the shooting starts in the sky - and the story is no fairy tale or a lullaby.  Wonderful movie with beauty of Tuscany that not even war could destroy and determination of the ordinary peasants to preserve their life, families and dignity.",4,Child witnessing end of the war,1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,1319,"['WWII', 'Italy', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'polarization', 'was', 'greatest', 'Fascists', 'have', 'lost', 'power', 'desire', 'control', 'was', 'still', 'strong', 'small', 'village', 'Tuscany', 'locals', 'are', 'anxious', 'arrival', 'allied', 'forces', 'will', 'prevent', 'destruction', 'homes', 'secure', 'safety', 'fascists', 'Unsure', 'what', 'do', 'most', 'villagers', 'have', 'choose', 'following', 'instructions', 'local', 'priest', 'following', 'own', 'heart', 'intuition.I', 'loved', 'relationships', 'portrayed', 'protagonists', 'movie', 'young', 'mother', 'trying', 'protect', 'daughter', 'narrator', 'story', 'old', 'couple', 'who', 'missed', 'out', 'being', 'married', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'due', 'social', 'norms', 'time', 'virgin', 'empowered', 'knowing', 'men', 'ages', 'desire', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'protect', 'pregnanat', 'bride', 'due', 'deliver', 'first', 'child', 'moment', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'too', 'human', 'fears', 'desires', 'fight', 'survival.Story', 'told', 'woman', 'who', 'experienced', '6', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'now', 'mother', 'herself', 'story', 'young', 'son', 'night', 'shooting', 'sky', 'story', 'fairy', 'tale', 'lullaby', 'Wonderful', 'movie', 'beauty', 'Tuscany', 'not', 'even', 'war', 'could', 'destroy', 'determination', 'ordinary', 'peasants', 'preserve', 'life', 'families', 'dignity']",N/A
