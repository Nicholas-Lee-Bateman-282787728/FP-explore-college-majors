Many songs are interrupted by the docu-element of this production. In reading reviews, some were annoyed by this. If you are looking for just music, this DVD is not it. For me, it was OK one time, but hereafter I would prefer just music presentation. I gave this 4 stars because I really like Jackson Browne's music--but the Dvd is a 3 after one viewing.

But for those with more insight than my own, it has been a wonderfully brilliant and ironically sad journey since the spark of the late sixties and seventies ignited &quot;a promise&quot; within us all, as unique individuals and a group, with a courageous eye towards making this world a better place for everyone. No one has better expressed the longing (and helped to keep &quot;the promise&quot; alive) than this supremely gifted artist (for all seasons and generations); and nowhere is this more poignantly and truthfully told than in thedocumentary, &quot;Going Home.&quot; Thank you, Jackson Browne, for this video. If my house was suddenly on fire (God forbid of course)-- and I had seconds to grab &quot;a thing&quot; -- &quot;Going Home&quot; would help me find the strength to go on; as well as brave the pain to find another &quot;home&quot; within which I could cope and thrive in truth and love for all those whom I hold dear. . .[albeit -- from a distance that's as close as your songs, both sweetly and bittersweetly sung (alone), and in harmony with your own].",5,A Must-Have,1005782400,"11 15, 2001",2001,1298,"['Jackson', 'Browne', 'simply', 'most', 'important', 'musician', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'generation', 'referred', 'quot', 'Baby', 'Boomers.', 'quot', 'Frankly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'label', 'words', 'are', 'linear', 'limiting', 'more', 'insight', 'own', 'been', 'wonderfully', 'brilliant', 'ironically', 'sad', 'journey', 'spark', 'late', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'ignited', 'quot', 'promise', 'quot', 'unique', 'individuals', 'group', 'courageous', 'eye', 'towards', 'making', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'everyone', 'one', 'better', 'expressed', 'longing', 'helped', 'keep', 'quot', 'promise', 'quot', 'supremely', 'gifted', 'artist', 'seasons', 'generations', 'nowhere', 'more', 'poignantly', 'truthfully', 'told', 'thedocumentary', 'quot', 'Going', 'Home.', 'quot', 'Thank', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'video', 'house', 'was', 'suddenly', 'fire', 'God', 'forbid', 'course', 'had', 'seconds', 'grab', 'quot', 'thing', 'quot', 'quot', 'Going', 'Home', 'quot', 'would', 'help', 'find', 'strength', 'go', 'as', 'well', 'brave', 'pain', 'find', 'quot', 'home', 'quot', 'could', 'cope', 'thrive', 'truth', 'love', 'whom', 'hold', 'dear', '[', 'albeit', 'distance', 'as', 'close', 'songs', 'sweetly', 'bittersweetly', 'sung', 'alone', 'harmony', 'own', ']']",N/A

Huber ""Michael  Huber""","[28, 31]","A couple of things first, my disc is defective as the first song has a blank black part, part way into it and this is not a concert, where as most of the songs are interrupted for interviews and the like.(I can't stand that!) Instead of letting the song play out and THEN talking either before or after, the producer decides to ruin the songs with interruptions. The documentary is great, the music is well recorded and professionally shot with mostly clean footage. I have seen other documentary DVDs that don't ruin the songs and are more enjoyable to watch AGAIN as you can skip past the interviews and watch and listen to the music. Doc's are good, but for me I can only watch then one or two times maybe before, OK I know what it's about, then I'm done with it if I can't play it with out skipping the documentary parts and getting P.O.'d. This is one of those where every thing about the DVD is very good, if it was a concert or the producer had common sense. The performances were for the most part excellent, same as the Audio and Video but I can't give it a 4 or 5 star rating even though it may deserve it the disappointment factor only let's me give it at the max a 3.Play the music first THEN talk, kind of like a commentary overriding a movie, now how many times can you watch that, once, twice? I'm a HUGE JB fan and have seen him live 3 times and with all the concert footage clips in this, why in Heaven's name is there no REAL concert DVDs from this guy! This is a good one to rent but to buy??? That's up to you.I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVDs and Blu-ray's.1.

So I bought the only available DVD concert of his work.  It is good but fluffed up with various interviews and retrospectives.

548379,A20KFS7XA57SXM,B00004REWA,Richard W. Field,"[97, 101]","Don't get me wrong.  I love Jackson Browne.  I have many fond memories of listening to his classic albums over and over again--we would have Jackson Browne nights when I was in college.  And yes, learning what we learn from the interviews about the way he makes his music, about his early beginnings as a musician, his political activism, etc. (by the way, as a parent I would love to hear his thoughts on parenthood), all is fascinating and is well worth watching.  But I would have made one plea to the editors: don't sacrifice the music!  I am one who finds it sacriligious to cut off a song early, or to enter a song late.  A song is an organic whole: if not heard in its entirety one has not heard the song.  But time and time again, this DVD cuts the songs off before their conclusion.  In fact, there are only perhaps three songs (and I mean &quot;perhaps&quot; because of some very quick editing) that we hear in full.  I expect this sort of thing from VH1 or MTV (for consumers who, at least many of them, don't hold music in such high regard over celebrity), but I don't expect this of a DVD.  The model of excellence in concert and interview video, as the model for so much in film making, is Martin Scorsese's work with The Last Waltz (The Band).  The interviews in that film are fascinating and informative, but separated from the music.  The format worked well on film, but even more on DVD.  One can listen to the interviews one wants, but also hear the music in full.Here's a message for Jackson Browne (if ever he would listen to this).  Jackson, there are a lot of middle aged, near to exhaustion, folks like me who would be revitalized by your music.  Yes we would love to hear whatever you want to say.  But we would more than love a concert from you, with all the unexpected moments, the spontaneous smiles (when you did it just right! or a sideman does a nice lick!), and just the great songs that you have written so consistently over the many years.  Give us another DVD please!  Your fans, believe me, will want to keep ahold of this DVD, but we would love that concert!",3,"Great, but I want to hear the music",1068768000,"11 14, 2003",2003,2095,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'have', 'many', 'fond', 'memories', 'listening', 'classic', 'albums', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'have', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'nights', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'yes', 'learning', 'what', 'learn', 'interviews', 'way', 'music', 'early', 'beginnings', 'musician', 'political', 'activism', 'etc', 'way', 'parent', 'would', 'love', 'hear', 'thoughts', 'parenthood', 'fascinating', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'plea', 'editors', 'do', ""n't"", 'sacrifice', 'music', 'am', 'one', 'who', 'sacriligious', 'cut', 'off', 'song', 'early', 'enter', 'song', 'late', 'song', 'organic', 'whole', 'not', 'heard', 'entirety', 'one', 'not', 'heard', 'song', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'DVD', 'songs', 'conclusion', 'fact', 'are', 'only', 'perhaps', 'three', 'songs', 'mean', 'quot', 'perhaps', 'quot', 'very', 'quick', 'editing', 'hear', 'full', 'expect', 'sort', 'thing', 'VH1', 'MTV', 'consumers', 'who', 'least', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'music', 'such', 'high', 'regard', 'celebrity', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'DVD', 'model', 'excellence', 'concert', 'interview', 'video', 'model', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'making', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'work', 'Last', 'Waltz', 'Band', 'interviews', 'film', 'are', 'fascinating', 'informative', 'separated', 'music', 'format', 'worked', 'well', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'DVD', 'One', 'can', 'listen', 'interviews', 'one', 'also', 'hear', 'music', 'full.Here', 'message', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'ever', 'would', 'listen', 'Jackson', 'are', 'lot', 'middle', 'aged', 'exhaustion', 'folks', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'revitalized', 'music', 'Yes', 'would', 'love', 'hear', 'want', 'say', 'would', 'more', 'love', 'concert', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'spontaneous', 'smiles', 'when', 'did', 'just', 'right', 'sideman', 'nice', 'lick', 'just', 'great', 'songs', 'have', 'written', 'so', 'consistently', 'many', 'years', 'Give', 'DVD', 'please', 'fans', 'believe', 'will', 'want', 'keep', 'ahold', 'DVD', 'would', 'love', 'concert']",N/A
