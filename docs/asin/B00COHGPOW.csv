1649759,A1KVIG0J3ZQL4P,B00COHGPOW,Kelsey,"[0, 1]",This is one of my personal favorite National Lampoon movies. It's absolutely hilarious and is one of those movies you can watch over and over and it still is funny. I was so excited when this came in the other day. Great movie to add to my collection. If you need a good laugh I recommend this movie!,5,National Lampoon's Animal House,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,300,"['one', 'personal', 'favorite', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'movies', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'still', 'funny', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'came', 'other', 'day', 'Great', 'movie', 'add', 'collection', 'need', 'good', 'laugh', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A
1649760,A1NGF708R4QTRZ,B00COHGPOW,L.E. Quaranta,"[2, 2]",This is a great movie with some classic humor and great fun. And of course John Belushi if you under 30 ask your parents or google his name. He much like Chris Farley passed before his time due to tragic circumstances and this movie is one of his best. He starts the classic food fight scene and the scene where he destroys the guitar at the toga party. You should buy this just because Belushi is in it.I can confirm as of Feb. 2014 the digital copy code works on iTunes unlike some other blu ray digital offerings,5,A classic movie,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,515,"['great', 'movie', 'classic', 'humor', 'great', 'fun', 'course', 'John', 'Belushi', '30', 'ask', 'parents', 'google', 'name', 'much', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'passed', 'time', 'due', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'classic', 'food', 'fight', 'scene', 'scene', 'where', 'guitar', 'toga', 'party', 'should', 'buy', 'just', 'Belushi', 'it.I', 'can', 'confirm', 'Feb.', '2014', 'digital', 'copy', 'code', 'iTunes', 'other', 'blu', 'ray', 'digital', 'offerings']",N/A

There are many extras worth anything you need o topaz for it It is presented in full 16x9 screen viewing so it is very well presented.,5,One of my favorite films. Very well done with great extras,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",2014,354,"['almost', 'had', 'entire', 'film', 'memorized', 'have', 'been', 'frat', 'early', '80', 'have', 'watched', 'more', 'then', 'few', 'times', '34', 'Pledge', 'need', 'dudes', '34', 'was', 'said', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'frat', 'was', 'very', 'welcome', 'are', 'many', 'extras', 'anything', 'need', 'o', 'topaz', 'presented', 'full', '16x9', 'screen', 'viewing', 'very', 'well', 'presented']",N/A
