It is about an emotionally troubled teenager named Laurel who is always telling lies, she lives with a grandmother who is very controlling and mean and hardly pays attention to her, a new governess named Miss Madrigal played by Deborah Kerr (from An Affair To Remember) comes to take care of her and she is a bit odd herself but she tries to help Laurel as she sees that she is not getting the love and attention that she needs and another reason she wants to help Laurel is because Laurel reminds her of her own troubled youth and she doesn't want Laurel to make the same mistakes she did.

In fact, this was the film that introduced me to the beautiful and talented Deborah Kerr. She played a governess named Madrigal with a mysterious past who came to take care of Hayley Mills. I remember this as Hayley's best performance as a child actress (and I still hold to it.) In addition to Kerr and Mills, there was another Mills: Hayley's dad, John (who played Maitland, the butler). And rounding out the cast were Edith Evans and Elisabeth Sellars. Not only was the script (based on Enid Bagnold's play) and direction (Ronald Neame) great, the cinematography was breathtaking!Over the years, this was one of my favorite films. I totally wore out my VHS copy and was waiting (for the longest time) for the DVD. Thank goodness, Amazon and Universal Vault brought this to me. This transfer is great! Beautiful sound and video. I will order another copy as a back-up in case I wear out my DVD.I watched it twice already and wondered why the Academy Awards only nominated Edith Evans. This was one of Deborah Kerr's best performances and she should have been nominated for the Oscar.

This well-crafted film deals with the relationship between a young girl,  played by Hayley Mills, living with her grandmother and the new nanny,  played by Deborah Kerr, hired to care for her.  The young girl is a  pyromaniac who compulsively manipulates and lies, perhaps as her way of  handling what she feels is a loveless existence.  Kerr's character, who has  a dark secret, is able to identify with the young girl, and the movie  follows her attempts to win the girl's friendship and eventual trust and to  teach the girl that there is still love in her life.This is a moving  film which deals seriously with its themes.  It is a little melodramatic in  a 1960's sort of way, but nonetheless remains quite involving and absorbing  for the audience.  I enjoyed it very much.

Mills lives with her grandmother, since Evans is unhappy with her daughter's second marriage and wants to protect her granddaughter.  John Mills works as the butler and Deborah Kerr is the latest in a long line of governesses hired.  Hayley has a way of scaring them away.  Kerr seems to have arrived without much of a past or family ties (but that becomes clearer later).  Hayley is angry at her mother and the world and feels very isolated and it's up to Kerr to find a way (whatever the cost) to get through to her.The performers are all strong.

Mills, as pyromaniac Laurel, gives one of her best film performances, and Kerr, as the only governess able to reach her, is equally fine.  The striking setting for the film (the southern coast of England) is both breathtaking and ominous - a contrast of the vibrant ocean and the barren chalk garden long abandoned by Laurel's grandmother.  The symbolism here is a bit heavy-handed, and the secrets harbored by both Laurel and her governess seem a bit too overwrought, but this is a fine film definitely worth seeing.The DVD itself is a DVD-R, and it may not function on some DVD players.  I had no trouble at all on an older model DVD player, but it would not play on our much newer Blu-Ray machine.  The picture quality is adequate - it does have some of the flatness of most DVD-R recordings, but it's letterboxed and the color was good.

It's obvious that it isn't digitally inhanced in any way, but still I have no complaints with the color and clarity.Second, the movie itself is one that I think will continue to be enjoyed by many for years to come.  The performances were absolutely stellar.  Hayley Mills was totally believable as Laurel the obnoxious teen who did and said outragous things to get attention.  She recognized immediately that she had met her match with Miss Madrigal and it was fun watching them banter with one another.  Deborah Kerr, as usual, was absolutely stunning as the cool and keenly observant Miss Madrigal. From the moment she came on the scene, I could hardly take my eyes off of her.  I loved how her beauty was even more enhanced by everything about her being toned down. That is something that I don't think was hard to do with Deborah Kerr!  Yes, I'm a huge fan! The conversation on the bus between Miss Madrigal and Laurel is one of my favorites from any movie. The older woman's facial expressions were fantastic.  John Mills was witty and likeable as, Maitland, keeper of the asylum, so to speak. The exchange between him and Laurel towards the end when Laurel finally realizes that she's taken things too far was amazing.  Dame Edith Evans was just right as the pearl-clutching, selfish, and over indulgent Mrs. St. Maugham.  She had a difficult time realizing that in trying to preserve her legacy, she was destroying the keeper of it.  Oh, and I chuckled everytime she would trill her Rs. It reminded me of another dame, Wendy Hiller, in ""Anne of Avonlea"".All in all, it is a really good film and I will enjoy many more times before it's all said and done.  My favorite line from this film is one that I will remember for a long time. At the end when Maitland asks Miss Madrigal what she will do next, she replies, ""Continue to explore the astonishment of living.""

But this is no prim and proper young English lady - Laurel (Hayley Mills) is a troubled youth who resides with her wealthy grandmother (wonderfully portrayed by Dame Edith Evans, who plays a crusty aristocratic Briton like no one can), and who spins lies, sets fires and steals without a thought to consequences. Obsessed with murder and criminal cases, she is accustomed to having her own way, and sets out to expose her new governess as a madwoman or something worse. Despite the child's negative attitude, Kerr stays on, trying to reach out to Laurel, who in reality, feels so unloved and unworthy that her anger could get her into deep trouble later on. Miss Madrigal attempts to bring Laurel's mother, Olivia (Elizabeth Sellars) back into the picture, but this only adds to the tension within the household. Maitland (Sir John Mills), the butler, seems to have an uncanny understanding of all the goings on and a wry sense of humor that most likely keeps him from blowing a gasket.Laurel begins to unravel Madrigal's secret, which comes full circle when a distinguished judge and family friend comes for a visit. The realization of her conviction for murder (it is never really confirmed whether she was guilty of the crime or not), serves as a reason as to why she has been so determined to save Laurel - she fears that the girl will end up on the same path she did. Madrigal opens the eyes of all around her - ""You should be frightened - you see before you the woman Laurel may yet become! The child who lied, cheated and hated, because she could not believe the simple fact that she was loved! You wanted the truth - and the truth may still save Laurel!"" I cannot stress enough that the cast is uniformly excellent, bringing the film's message to the viewer's attention without bashing them on the head with it. Hayley and her late father act marvelously together, and Kerr embodies her role with such mystery, knowledge and concern that you never feel any malice for her, even after her past is revealed.An expressive musical score, lovely cinematography, both on location in England and at London's Pinewood Studios, as well as the intrigue surrounding Kerr's character make for a fantastically rich viewing experience.",5,Poignant Drama With Intrigue And Humor,1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,2424,"['Enid', 'Bagnold', 'play', 'directed', 'big', 'screen', 'Ronald', 'Neame', '1964', 'touching', 'story', 'mystery', 'woman', 'Madrigal', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'who', 'ad', 'companion', 'teenage', 'girl', 'prim', 'proper', 'young', 'English', 'lady', 'Laurel', 'Hayley', 'Mills', 'troubled', 'youth', 'who', 'wealthy', 'grandmother', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'Dame', 'Edith', 'Evans', 'who', 'crusty', 'aristocratic', 'Briton', 'one', 'can', 'who', 'lies', 'sets', 'fires', 'steals', 'thought', 'consequences', 'Obsessed', 'murder', 'criminal', 'cases', 'accustomed', 'having', 'own', 'way', 'out', 'expose', 'new', 'governess', 'madwoman', 'something', 'worse', 'child', 'negative', 'attitude', 'Kerr', 'trying', 'reach', 'out', 'Laurel', 'who', 'reality', 'feels', 'so', 'unloved', 'unworthy', 'anger', 'could', 'get', 'deep', 'trouble', 'later', 'Miss', 'Madrigal', 'attempts', 'bring', 'Laurel', 'mother', 'Olivia', 'Elizabeth', 'Sellars', 'back', 'picture', 'only', 'tension', 'household', 'Maitland', 'Sir', 'John', 'Mills', 'butler', 'have', 'uncanny', 'understanding', 'goings', 'wry', 'sense', 'humor', 'most', 'likely', 'keeps', 'blowing', 'gasket.Laurel', 'unravel', 'Madrigal', 'secret', 'full', 'circle', 'when', 'distinguished', 'judge', 'family', 'friend', 'visit', 'realization', 'conviction', 'murder', 'never', 'really', 'confirmed', 'was', 'guilty', 'crime', 'not', 'reason', 'why', 'been', 'so', 'determined', 'save', 'Laurel', 'girl', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'same', 'path', 'did', 'Madrigal', 'eyes', 'should', 'be', 'frightened', 'see', 'woman', 'Laurel', 'may', 'yet', 'become', 'child', 'who', 'lied', 'cheated', 'hated', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'simple', 'fact', 'was', 'loved', 'wanted', 'truth', 'truth', 'may', 'still', 'save', 'Laurel', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'bringing', 'film', 'message', 'viewer', 'attention', 'bashing', 'head', 'Hayley', 'late', 'father', 'act', 'marvelously', 'together', 'Kerr', 'role', 'such', 'mystery', 'knowledge', 'concern', 'never', 'feel', 'malice', 'even', 'past', 'revealed.An', 'expressive', 'musical', 'score', 'lovely', 'cinematography', 'location', 'England', 'London', 'Pinewood', 'Studios', 'as', 'well', 'intrigue', 'surrounding', 'Kerr', 'character', 'make', 'fantastically', 'rich', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A

But a lot of their interaction just rings hollow, somehow--maybe because Mills is so insufferably bratty that it's hard to believe Kerr isn't moved to, at the very least, occasional bouts of unconstrained rage.  Indeed, Kerr is so prim and controlled that one tends to question the movie's basic premise--i.e., that Kerr was just like Mills at that age.  The upshot is that the script's dramatic potential never fully unfolds.  My instinct is to blame this on the direction of Ronald Neame, whose work has always struck me as competent but uninspired.  This is a gritty story that should have been told grittily, but, except from Mills, there's hardly a speck of grit anywhere.All that said, this movie remains a worthwhile conversation piece, one that I think is genuinely useful to an understanding of early 1960s' female pathos.  Mills' character seems hopelessly torn between the only two models of girlhood available--the ""nice,"" well-mannered girl who never speaks out of turn, and the ""bad"" girl careening towards a terrible end.  Mills clearly doesn't belong where the ""bad"" girls go--i.e., jail, or someplace even worse--but just being a ""nice"" girl will never be enough.  The solution the movie offers to Mills's problem--maternal love and understanding--is too easy, to be sure, for in reality there is probably no solution at all.  But the script's insistence upon finding a happy ending, and redemption for both Mills and Kerr, is revolutionary nonetheless; here, finally, is a movie about rebelious women who don't die at the end.Four stars, mostly for social commentary and discussion value.",4,"Good Melodrama, But Something is Missing ...",1117411200,"05 30, 2005",2005,1827,"['Hayley', 'Mills', 'good', 'job', 'milking', 'emotion', 'be', 'milked', 'furious', 'histrionic', 'teenager', '*Chalk', 'Garden*', 'always', 'enjoy', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'repressed', 'governess-type', 'roles', 'lot', 'interaction', 'just', 'rings', 'hollow', 'somehow', 'maybe', 'Mills', 'so', 'insufferably', 'hard', 'believe', 'Kerr', ""n't"", 'moved', 'very', 'least', 'occasional', 'bouts', 'unconstrained', 'rage', 'Indeed', 'Kerr', 'so', 'prim', 'controlled', 'one', 'question', 'movie', 'basic', 'premise', 'i.e.', 'Kerr', 'was', 'just', 'like', 'Mills', 'age', 'upshot', 'script', 'dramatic', 'potential', 'never', 'fully', 'unfolds', 'instinct', 'blame', 'direction', 'Ronald', 'Neame', 'work', 'always', 'struck', 'competent', 'uninspired', 'gritty', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'grittily', 'Mills', 'hardly', 'speck', 'grit', 'anywhere.All', 'said', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'conversation', 'piece', 'one', 'think', 'genuinely', 'useful', 'understanding', 'early', '1960s', 'female', 'pathos', 'Mills', 'character', 'hopelessly', 'torn', 'only', 'two', 'models', 'girlhood', 'available', 'nice', 'well-mannered', 'girl', 'who', 'never', 'turn', 'bad', 'girl', 'careening', 'towards', 'terrible', 'end', 'Mills', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'belong', 'where', 'bad', 'girls', 'go', 'i.e.', 'jail', 'someplace', 'even', 'worse', 'just', 'being', 'nice', 'girl', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'enough', 'solution', 'movie', 'Mills', 'problem', 'maternal', 'love', 'understanding', 'too', 'easy', 'be', 'sure', 'reality', 'probably', 'solution', 'script', 'insistence', 'finding', 'happy', 'ending', 'redemption', 'Mills', 'Kerr', 'revolutionary', 'nonetheless', 'here', 'finally', 'movie', 'rebelious', 'women', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'die', 'end.Four', 'stars', 'mostly', 'social', 'commentary', 'discussion', 'value']",N/A

John Mills is the perfect foil to both Miss Kerr and (his daughter) Hayley. never actually taking sides but his character knows how to play for and against both of the female leads.  wonderful movie.

Kerr is a mysterious woman who is applying for the position of governess at a stately old house.  Kerr hasn't any experience nor references to give to her staid but essentially tender-hearted employer (played carefully by Dame Edith Evans, grotesquely dressed in lavender much of the time).  Hayley Mills plays the troubled Laurel, a sprited, lying adolescent girl of 16 - who is much like Miss Madrigal (Kerr) was at the girl's same age.....There is an astonishing twist and a fairly satisfying ending - however, this movie is hardly high on most people's list of favourites, somehow.  The symbolic film title refers to the chalk dominated soil of the garden - in which nothing can grow without additional nourishment - Evans hired Kerr because of the latters knowledge that nothing will possibly grow in a chalk garden without potash and other necessary and vital nutrients essential for thriving flowerbeds -an allegorical parallel to Laurel herself: the girl will never grow to be a gentle, loving and giving soul without her mother's love - which is cruelly withheld from her by her seemingly devoted and selfless Grandmother...",4,WEIRD AND WONDERFUL.,1023580800,"06 9, 2002",2002,1222,"['rather', 'unusual', 'little', 'film', 'based', 'unusual', 'play', 'Enid', 'Bagnold', 'Kerr', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'who', 'applying', 'position', 'governess', 'stately', 'old', 'house', 'Kerr', ""n't"", 'experience', 'references', 'give', 'staid', 'essentially', 'tender-hearted', 'employer', 'played', 'carefully', 'Dame', 'Edith', 'Evans', 'grotesquely', 'dressed', 'lavender', 'much', 'time', 'Hayley', 'Mills', 'troubled', 'Laurel', 'sprited', 'lying', 'adolescent', 'girl', '16', 'who', 'much', 'Miss', 'Madrigal', 'Kerr', 'was', 'girl', 'same', 'age', 'astonishing', 'twist', 'fairly', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'however', 'movie', 'hardly', 'high', 'most', 'people', 'list', 'favourites', 'somehow', 'symbolic', 'film', 'title', 'refers', 'chalk', 'dominated', 'soil', 'garden', 'nothing', 'can', 'grow', 'additional', 'nourishment', 'Evans', 'hired', 'Kerr', 'latters', 'knowledge', 'nothing', 'will', 'possibly', 'grow', 'chalk', 'garden', 'potash', 'other', 'necessary', 'vital', 'nutrients', 'essential', 'thriving', 'flowerbeds', '-an', 'allegorical', 'parallel', 'Laurel', 'girl', 'will', 'never', 'grow', 'be', 'gentle', 'loving', 'giving', 'soul', 'mother', 'love', 'cruelly', 'withheld', 'seemingly', 'devoted', 'selfless', 'Grandmother']",N/A

206503,A3OH36BA3YSN7M,6300186121,timcon1964,"[1, 1]","""The Chalk Garden"" brings Edith Bagnold's 1951 play to the screen.  The film focuses on Laurel, a troubled 16-year-old who moved in with her grandmother, Mrs. St. Maugham, in protest against her mother's re-marriage.  Mrs. St. Maugham hired various governesses to deal with Laurel; but the young girl quickly drove them away.  They failed to comprehend her; but she discovered their deepest secrets, and immediately conveyed these to her grandmother, leading to the dismissals of a succession of governesses.  When Mrs. St. Maugham hires Miss Madrigal as the new governess, the tables are turned.  Laurel cannot figure out Madrigal--an enigmatic figure, who, although almost aristocratic in bearing, is unable to provide any references.  But Madrigal completely comprehends Laurel at once.  Olivia, Laurel's mother, plans to reclaim custody of her daughter; but Mrs. St. Maugham is determined to prevent this.  Meanwhile, Maitland, the butler/general factotum, tries to keep the household on an even keel.That there is a certain complexity to each of these characters adds credibility and interest to the story.  Laurel is a highly inquisitive, intelligent, and analytical person, whose judgments are sometimes very perceptive.  Often disrespectful and occasionally obnoxious, in private, Laurel is tormented by grief.  Mrs. St. Maugham is a generous but domineering woman--she wants the best for Olivia, but feels compelled to impose her choices on her daughter.  And Maitland is recovering from his own personal tragedy.There are some weaknesses in the screenplay.  In an early scene, Laurel urges Madrigal to smile more because she is beautiful when she smiles, then comments that Madrigal is ""quite accomplished"" as an artist, and then indicates that she values the governess' compliments about her own painting.  It appears that there is in Laurel's view of Madrigal an element of admiration that she had not felt for her other governesses.  But the screenplay does not develop Laurel's ambivalent feelings, although these are an important part of the story.  Similarly, Olivia's maternal feelings are not much in evidence.  We see Olivia primarily in confrontation with her mother.  For four years, she has failed to contest custody of Laurel, for reasons that are not satisfactorily explained.  Even now, Olivia says she is trying to regain Laurel because she is ""my daughter, not yours""--which suggests there is an element of competition as well as compassion in her custody battle.  Finally, the screenplay makes an effort to soften Madrigal's past.  This weakens the plot.  If Madrigal's travails resulted only from a failure of the justice system, what is the relevance of her experience for Laurel's situation?But the script is fundamentally strong.  It stimulates concern about Laurel and weaves an air of mystery around Madrigal.  It also limns the personalities of the principal characters, and shows how the outcome of the story has implications for all of them.  Adult viewers may find themselves waiting to see who will finally tame the troubled teenager.  But, in a rather sudden and surprising fashion, Laurel's obnoxious faade is cracked when her own machinations reveal Madrigal's mysterious past.  Following this event, a series of carefully crafted dialogues, each with a somewhat unexpected outcome, take the story to its conclusion.Undoubtedly, the greatest strength of ""The Chalk Garden"" is its world-class cast.  And, in view of the extreme close-up photography in the most emotional moments, the actors had to master the tiniest details of their performances.  This is the cast you might have assembled if you got your first choice of the actor for each role.  Edith Evans (nominated for three Academy Awards from 1963-1967) as Mrs. St. Maugham, and Deborah Kerr (nominated for five Academy Awards from 1953-1960) as Madrigal, were ideal for the roles of the aristocratic elderly British lady and the reserved governess.  Many actors could have portrayed an English butler, but, as Maitland, John Mills (nominated for three BAFTA awards and one Academy Award) could also draw on varied talents to toss off insouciant comments to potential governesses and Mrs. St. Maugham, and even engage in a physical confrontation with Laurel.  The great gamble was to cast Hayley Mills as Laurel.  Other cast members had years of experience and had played similar roles in the past.  Although she had been nominated for two Academy Awards and had received a special honorary Academy Award, Ms. Mills was only 17, and had never portrayed anyone remotely like Laurel.  She must have found certain scenes hugely challenging, as some required her to show almost every emotion and to give credibility to seemingly irrational mood swings.  In this reviewer's opinion, it is perhaps her best on-screen performance, and should be required viewing for those who think Mills could portray only Pollyanna-type characters.  Felix Aylmer, who had played many ""gray eminence"" roles, does well as Judge McWhirrey.  But Elizabeth Sellars' performance as Olivia, as noted above, is cramped by the script.The DVD comes without peripherals, but (fortunately) is in 1.85:1 format.  A pan-and-scan version would have been a disaster, because in some key scenes the dramatis personae are arrayed all across the screen.",5,An Overlooked Little Gem,1340668800,"06 26,
