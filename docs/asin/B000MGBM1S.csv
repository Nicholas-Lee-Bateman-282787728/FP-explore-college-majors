1046189,A3EXIZWHSNVNME,B000MGBM1S,"Cynthia ""Andante Cantabile""","[2, 3]","I love this series.  I've been a William H. Macy fan for years and though he's played a lot of character roles and been excellent in them he's seldom the lead.  I'm so happy he was chosen to play the patriarch in ""Shameless"".  Having said that I was a little disappointed in the first episode.  In the pilot he was mostly face down sprawled on the ground or floor sleeping off the alcohol and pills he'd taken.  Macy, Frank Gallagher, is a single father of six kids.  The eldest is Fiona at 21.  Since their mother left almost two years ago Fiona has had her hands full raising the younger kids with not only no help from Frank but major interference on his part.  Frank waltzes in and out of the house to party, take the kid's money, rage, and be a general nuisance.  Fiona is played by Emmy Rossum.  She's a real standout in the pilot but her charm waned for me in subsequent episodes.  She has beautiful brown eyes but how many close ups do we really need?  Another stand out cast member is oldest brother and brainiac Jeremy Allen White as Phillip or Lip as his family calls him.  At 17 he's trying to find his place in the world though he's already sure of himself as the heart of his family.  I have to mention 10 year old Emma Kenney who plays Debbie.  She's a real stand out mimicking Fiona's mother role by taking care of her toddler brother Liam.  She's always the first to come to anyone's rescue when upset threatens and no matter how badly Frank or anyone in their tough Chicago Southside neighborhood treats her she still leads with her heart.  This is not to say she's a pushover.  This little girl knows how to come out swinging metaphorically.""Shameless"" is real, meaning the language and situations can be graphic, the emotions raw, and morality is pliable but it's all for a reason.

1046196,ARR0FAKQQJU06,B000MGBM1S,GatorFan,"[3, 5]","This BBC series, season 1, is like no television I have ever seen in America.  Its characters are earthy, steamy, messy, fallible, and totally engaging.  The patriarch, Frank, is a falling-down drunk who, along with his six kids, has been abandoned by his wife.  Frank has few, if any, redeeming characteristics, and the kids are reared by the oldest sibling, Fiona.  Fiona's boyfriend is Steve, a successful car thief with a heart of gold.  Steve is played by James McAvoy, a Scotsman I've heard described as ""the thinking woman's dream man.""  His undeniable charm aside, McAvoy is simply one of the best young actors making movies today.  He has won many awards, including a ""Best Actor"" BAFTA (British version of our Academy Award).  Fiona is played by Anne-Marie Duff, another talented actor.  (An aside:  McAvoy and Duff began dating during the filming of this series, and the real-life attraction between them is palpable on screen.

I may be somewhat jaded since I was introduced to this series viathe Showtime version, which IMHO is a far superior implementation than the original, and ifyou haven't seen it yet you need to check it out cause its the best thing thats happened tocable since the Sopranos.The only reason I was able to follow the storyline in this series is because of my familiaritywith the US version. It basically follows the same plotlines, in different sequence, butwithout that baseline, I never would have known what the hell was going on here.One of the biggest issues with this show is the character Frank McEvoy is just not likeableat all. He's a total scumbag with no redeeming value whatsoever, compare that to the BillMacy character on Showtime, who is also a total scumbag, but with charm and a certain appeal.Anyway, I could go on and on but I wont. One reviewer mentioned the fact that this castis much ""less attractive"" than the US cast. True.....true.....true! lolBottom line, this is not a show that will appeal to a mass US audience, primarily due to thelanguage and cultural barrier.

The second paragraph is my updated review, since I have now seen the remaining 11 episodes. I saw all of the episodes with XFinity On Demand.The pilot of this series is quitte good, with an excellent cast, headlined by the beautiful and talented Emmy Rossum (""Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom Of The Opera""). There's only one griope I have with the pilot: a scene showing a naked guy in bed. Did he HAVE TO BE FULLY NUDE? That scene was disgusting, and makes me seriously consider whether or not I want to watch more episodes of this otherwise interesting series. I hope the gay character is straightened out at some point as well. At least, nothing was shown in the pilot, but you never know how far writers will take things these days.The rest of the episodes are really good, but my main issue remains: Ian is still gay, and though nothing is shown, it's still strongly implied. And do they have to profane God's name? (ie. God's name followed by a mild curse word, thereby making it a strong profanity). Real minuses for me, hence the four star rating. Other than that, I highly enjoy the series. I like how Fiona really loves her siblings, even the rebellious ones, like Carl (the actor looks like he could really be Miley Cyrus' younger brother).

Where Californication is carried by David Duchovny and Evan Handler, the humor on Shameless comes from an ensemble cast.All of the characters are ""flawed"" to a certain degree and most have redeeming qualities as well.  What makes this work is that the plot lines are not formulaic or ""black & white"".  Furthermore, what makes this show truly rare, is that there is evolution wrapped around the comedy, where character development is highly evident.  Many shows that are billed as comedies get lost when the writers attempt to show growth in the characters.  Generally, a show will last for a season or 2 or until the formula that made the show funny is lost.  I don't see that happening here, as there are so many directions that the writers can take show while staying true to the comedy.Of course there is a fair amount of nudity and dialogue that would even Alec Baldwin blush!Finally, while the US TV viewer would not likely imagine the number of shows that have emanated from the UK, the vast majority implode when ""re-made"" for American consumption.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[11, 13]","Few things make me more nervous than when someone has the bright idea to adapt one of my favorite British TV programs into an American version. For every successful translation (""The Office""), there are dozens of failed attempts (""Coupling""). So when I heard that Showtime was preparing to drop ""Shameless"" with William H. Macy, Joan Cusack, and Emmy Rossum--I got very very scared. Not because of the cast, but because, to me, ""Shameless"" is a quintessentially British show. The original version is an absolutely lunatic bit of brilliance that has all the elements to be a crashing disaster and yet balances them so adeptly, so audaciously, and so precisely. Instead of pushing into nightmarishly precious, overwrought, and quirky territory--somehow the show succeeds spectacularly. Don't get me wrong--the show is precious and overwrought and quirky--but every bit of it is in a good way.So how did Paul Abbott do in formatting his original creation for an American audience? I'd say that it's a qualified success. If you've never seen the original program (and let's face it, most people won't have), this incarnation of ""Shameless"" is likely to seem strikingly different from most American domestic comedy with its unabashed embracing of lawlessness and anarchy. Adhering to the British original, but expanding subplots or introducing them earlier as there are more first season episodes, the version sticks fairly true to the initial plotting. In the first few episodes, the show seems on incessant overdrive slapping you in the face with its over-the-top antics. As such, in my opinion, it lacks a bit of heart, subtlety, and precise comic balancing of the original. Despite its unruliness, the original made you care about its characters from the jump. It takes about half of Season One for the American version to start really developing characters that you might actually want to root for. Once that kicks in, however, you're likely to find that certain elements of the program will get under your skin and really work.Chronicling the lives of the Gallagher family, ""Shameless"" introduces us to a wastrel father and his brood of six kids. With mom out of the picture, oldest daughter Fiona (Rossum) has taken up the slack for a largely absent and altogether alcoholic father (Macy). This is a show of survival as the Gallaghers eke out an existence in lower income America. With the assistance of her new boyfriend (Justin Chatwin), this dysfunctional family unit triumphs despite itself. There's much drunken debauchery, plenty of illicit sex, fair amounts of stealing, fisticuffs galore, and even an odd kidnapping--this isn't mild entertainment.Not worried about ""good taste"" or ""political correctness,"" Paul Abbott's ingenious creation is a modern family unit unlike any other on contemporary TV. With an impressive, and massive cast, even the supporting characters get their chance to shine. Rossum has been praised for bringing a realness to the lead role and rightly so. For me, the unexpected heart in ""Shameless,"" however, comes from Joan Cusack--a part that might have been painfully awkward is surprisingly tender! Fast-paced, loud, irreverent, crude, disturbing and yet oddly touching when necessary, I absolutely adored the original program and I have come to appreciate the charms of its successor. It took a bit for it to find its footing, but it did. As long as they keep working to ground their characters, the show can only get better.

Although some of it you just shake your head at in disbelief, most of it is relatable in one way or another and just so very real. I am totally hooked on it now. There are so many different story lines and types of drama within it, that it stays interesting and attention grabbing.There are also many tear jerking moments, and not because of cheesey/corny moments, but because a lot of the situations are so seemingly real and/or sad or just emotional in general. (The second season gets more into the emotional aspect).I actually bought this first season set for my mom as a Christmas present. She had never seen Shameless yet and it is such a great series on so many levels, that I thought she would like it.It is one of those shows where you watch and say O M G, about 10 different times throughout the episode.Definitely give it a try. Watch a few complete episodes before giving up on it! I gaurantee you will be hooked too!

I bought the set of the first 3 seasons the last time I was over, and tucked it away until recently, and OH MY GOD!! What a show!!Humor, sex, drama, pathos, and what's a pleasant surprise is that Frank Gallagher ISN'T the main character, which I'd expected, but is just one of a great ensemble cast. Frank is kind of like the character Mickey Rourke played inBarfly, but his little comments about life being a ""working-class hero"" and how tough it is being a ""single parent"" are hilarious, since A)he's probably been on the dole his entire life & never worked a day and B)He's so screwed up all the time that his oldest daughter, Fiona(played by the wonderful Anne-Marie Duff), has single-handedly raised her sibs since their Mum left a couple of years before the series opens. With the help of assorted neighbors and friends, the Gallagher clan struggle on.With nearly as many plotlines per episode as a ""Seinfeld"" episode, it's no surprise that American TV is ripping ""Shameless"" off(ala ""The Office""), reportedly to star William H. Macy as a Rust-Belt version of Frank. I enjoy Macy, but there's only one Frank Gallagher(except when I'm bloody pissed, and then I see two or three.Warning: there is some pretty raw sex in this show, so if you're offended by that sort of stuff...sod off!",5,"30 reviews, every one 5 stars!!",1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,1361,"['friend', 'told', 'Shameless', 'when', 'was', 'UK', '6', '7', 'years', 'ago', 'bought', 'set', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'over', 'tucked', 'away', 'recently', 'OH', 'MY', 'GOD', 'What', 'show', 'Humor', 'sex', 'drama', 'pathos', 'what', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Frank', 'Gallagher', ""N'T"", 'main', 'character', ""'d"", 'expected', 'just', 'one', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Frank', 'kind', 'character', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'played', 'inBarfly', 'little', 'comments', 'life', 'being', 'working-class', 'hero', 'how', 'tough', 'being', 'single', 'parent', 'are', 'hilarious', 'probably', 'been', 'dole', 'entire', 'life', 'never', 'worked', 'day', 'B', 'so', 'screwed', 'up', 'time', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Fiona', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'single-handedly', 'raised', 'sibs', 'Mum', 'left', 'couple', 'years', 'series', 'help', 'assorted', 'neighbors', 'friends', 'Gallagher', 'clan', 'struggle', 'on.With', 'nearly', 'as', 'many', 'plotlines', 'episode', 'Seinfeld', 'episode', 'surprise', 'American', 'TV', 'ripping', 'Shameless', 'Office', 'reportedly', 'star', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Rust-Belt', 'version', 'Frank', 'enjoy', 'Macy', 'only', 'one', 'Frank', 'Gallagher', 'when', ""'m"", 'bloody', 'pissed', 'then', 'see', 'two', 'three.Warning', 'pretty', 'raw', 'sex', 'show', 'so', ""'re"", 'offended', 'sort', 'stuff']",Shameless: Season 1

No, make that after watching the first ten minutes.Holy Bad Behavior there Batman!Yeah, yeah, I know cable was supposed to be pushing the envelope, but except for the F-word getting worked to death, it was pretty much business as usual. Or more to the point, BS as usual.  Dexter? Come on...same old cheap Moralizing for Dummies, only now we have a serial killer teaching Bad Guys about the wages of sin, not Jim Anderson teaching Bud and Kitten about good citizenship. I cancelled my cable and walked away for a couple years.  I took another peek a couple of weeks ago and fell right off of my high horse!When did TV get so smart? So funny?  So...seditious?  When did they start using real writers, not frat boys or survivors of the Sheldon Schwartz School of Sitcoms? It all started with Treme, an amazing show about New Orleans that got it all right, the characters, the place, the setting, the music...everything.  Next came The Wire.  Another eye opener. Gritty, violent and good.  I sensed a new direction but still I had no clue how far things had gone. So then I watched The Vikings.  Let's hear it for Violence.  Eye-bugging, jaw dropping, violence with severed aortas pumping away, torsos cleaved in two, limbs flying, eyes gouged. And that's just  the opening credits.I thought I had seen it all...until I watched the first episode of ""Shameless.""Real, honest, funny, horrible...it's a family. The way families really are. More or less.  It feels real. Frank is not going to be Father of the Year, and Child Protective Services would have a field day if they peeked in the window. But he  loves his kids albeit in his own way. The kids look after one another. And love one another. That's not necessarily a given even when the parents are church-going, steadfast, homework monitoring, balanced meal serving pillars of the community. But the language is coarse, the kids are lighting up doobies, and no moral values are being ingrained.  They're just getting along day to day.So is this a good thing, this new celebration of the sordid? This wallowing in sex, drugs, violence and all sorts of Bad Behavior?  What impact will it have on society?  What will happen to our children if they grow up seeing stuff on TV you would not discuss with your husband or wife (or both)? In the first episode of ""Shameless"", I saw a kid do something with his underwear (and for good reason) that had me torn between hysterical laughter and abject horror.  The show shocked my modesty, which is some good trick, believe you me.  But mostly I just like it.  Shameless is not pandering to our lower instincts, it's really funny. Witty, even. Bright, clever and disgusting. How's that for the trifecta?Into the fourth episode now, and am torn between wanting to marry Frank or having him put down like a rabid dog. He is a drunk, a welfare cheat, an absentee father with the parenting skills of a newt.  And it is a joy to behold. William Macy is one of the best things ever to happen to movies or television. The entire cast is good. So far it keeps getting better.And really, did the old school kind of television, the kind that taught Good Behavior have any influence on us? Did anyone ever not cheat on a spouse or on their income taxes because of Mike Brady's endless sermonizing? Do you ever see a criminal or some poor drugged out wretch or other miscreant and say to yourself ""There but for the grace of June and Ward Cleaver go I?""Thought so.Enjoy the bad stuff without guilt. It cannot possible make us any worse than we already are.  Four stars because this is a good show, not a great show.  Some episodes are a lot better than others. Compared to Treme, The Wire or Breaking Bad, it's not quite top tier.

You could hardly call them children at their age and level of maturity. You can almost guarantee that the series will get more raunchy  in future if they can get away with what was in the first series. Most of the sex was in  viewers minds rather than seeing it  full-on on screen.Let's hope that the series does not lose its momentum  in the future as so many  do.

The UK cast seems much more realistic, especially with Frank. William H. Macy is a great actor most of the time but not here. He really just seemed to be more of a dirty homeless bum than a drunk drugy which made his character far less believable. Aside from that, the US version has the exact same plot and was almost shot for shot. It's not episode for episode since they seem to have semi-randomly grabbed episodes from many seasons to remake. So if you've seen the UK version then you know what's going to happen next in the US version(aside from the last episode). But the US version does have A LOT more female nudity which never hurts.And I don't know about where they are but I worked all over Kansas City, Mo in nothing but the poorer ghetto type areas and I've never seen a predominantly white ghetto, actually I've never heard of one anywhere in the US. I'm not saying that we don't have them but it seems more believable that there might be an area in the UK with a large number of poorer white people.Also: We have a lot of guns in the US, Most of the situations in the UK version would have been a lot different if everyone had a gun.",3,Not as believable.,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,1257,"['American', 'hate', 'admit', 'anyone', 'else', 'something', 'better', 'do', 'case', 'true', 'UK', 'cast', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'especially', 'Frank', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'great', 'actor', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'here', 'really', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'dirty', 'homeless', 'bum', 'drunk', 'drugy', 'made', 'character', 'far', 'less', 'believable', 'Aside', 'US', 'version', 'exact', 'same', 'plot', 'was', 'almost', 'shot', 'shot', 'not', 'episode', 'episode', 'seem', 'have', 'semi-randomly', 'grabbed', 'episodes', 'many', 'seasons', 'remake', 'So', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'UK', 'version', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'US', 'version', 'aside', 'last', 'episode', 'US', 'version', 'have', 'LOT', 'more', 'female', 'nudity', 'never', 'hurts.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'are', 'worked', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Mo', 'nothing', 'poorer', 'ghetto', 'type', 'areas', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'predominantly', 'white', 'ghetto', 'actually', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'one', 'anywhere', 'US', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'believable', 'might', 'be', 'area', 'UK', 'large', 'number', 'poorer', 'white', 'people.Also', 'have', 'lot', 'guns', 'US', 'Most', 'situations', 'UK', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'different', 'everyone', 'had', 'gun']",Shameless: Season 1

1046262,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,B000MGBM1S,The Wingchair Critic,"[0, 0]","Showtime's 'Shameless' (2011) is a more self-conscious, fanciful, and decompressed adaption of the original BBC program of the same name. But, while 'Shameless' aggressively celebrates its inversion of traditional American values, it is important to keep in mind that it represents as much an idealization of the values it does uphold as 'Leave It To Beaver' (1957-1963) and 'Father Knows Best' (1954-1960) did in their era.While 'Shameless,' which is essentially a comedic soap opera with dramatic overtones, explores 'the broken home,' adultery, alcoholism, teenage sexuality, homosexuality, mental illness, suicide, child sociopathy, sexual fetishism, theft as a way of life, and other elements traditionally consigned to life on 'the other side of the tracks' in America, note that very little genuine harm of any kind ever comes to any character, no matter how young or vulnerable, as a result of their behavior.In traditional American television fashion, physical injuries heal within moments or by the next scene, emotional trauma seems to be only of the readily-manageable kind, and characters fall asleep drunk in the snow in the dead of the Chicago winter without freezing to death or losing toes or fingers.Despite the abundance of threats and dangers surrounding and intruding upon them at every turn, including extreme violence and, in at least one case, a murder, nothing of permanent significance ever happens to any of the Gallaghers, who are clearly the heroes of the series, so what might be called 'the traditional unspoken American television show contract between the producers and the audience' applies: ""The Gallaghers will persevere.""Even secondary characters seem impervious to trauma: teenage psychopath Mickey (Noel Fisher) is sent to juvenile prison, but reappears in the narrative when the producers need him to reappear; his months-long incarceration is brushed off as if completely inconsequential.Another secondary character commits suicide with apparent success at the climax of Season One, but nothing nearly as final happens to any of the Gallaghers, with their almost a superhuman ability to recover from arrests, loss of employment, beatings, expulsions from school, kidnappings, and other experiences which most people find very difficult to assimilate and overcome in real life.Despite the relative deprivation, chaos and squalor the Gallaghers are presented as existing in, note that their household is typically flooded in warm amber hues mornings and evenings. Though food is constantly implied to be in short supply, the motherless Gallaghers are constantly seen eating, and no one ever complains of anything approaching actual hunger.While the Gallagher children's alcoholic and habitually grifting father, Frank (Willam H. Macy), is typically absent, the Gallagher children nonetheless receive genuine abundant love and oversight from oldest son Lip (Jeremy Allen White). Elder daughter Fiona (Emmy Rossum) and her best friend and neighbor, Veronica (Shanola Hampton), and their respective lovers, professional car thief Steve (Justin Chatwin) and bar owner Kev (Steve Howey) are regularly on hand to hold the figurative roof up and thus prevent outright catastrophe.Which is to say that the American branch of the Gallagher clan, despite the show's trappings, actually have it pretty good.As in 'Father Knows Best,' 'The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriett' (1952-1966), or 'The Brady Bunch' (1969-1974), most episodes of 'Shameless' end in 'feel good moments' in which some or all members of the Gallagher family reassert their love and concern for one another, though here in a hearty 'us against them' fashion that wouldn't have been out of place on 'Married With Children' (1987-1997).As the degree of sentimentalization remains identical, regardless of the values esteemed, 'Shameless' no more presents an accurate or honest view of American life, or a segment of American life, than 'The Donna Reed Show' (1958-1966) did in its time. This is important, as some critics, and no doubt many viewers, seem to believe that 'Shameless' is finally representing a segment of American life as it actually is in fact.The irreverent 'Shameless' is a creative, colorful, and romanticized version of its BBC counterpart. It is funny when it tries to be and dramatic when it wants to be. William H. Macy, Emmy Rossum, Jeremy Allen White, and Joan Cusack, among others, are beautifully wedded, even welded, to their parts.If 'Shameless' is grossly unrealistic and potentially irresponsible from a social perspective, then perhaps the producer's frequently rose-tinted approach to their predominantly White suburban ghetto is meant to underscore the program's fictional basis, even if we ""all know a family exactly like that.""",4,Romancing Life On 'The Wrong Side Of The Tracks',1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,4757,"['Showtime', ""'Shameless"", '2011', 'more', 'self-conscious', 'fanciful',
