1092680,A12IRGQLFE4EBA,B000TZ0JZM,"Fabulinus ""To err is human. To forgive for no...","[2, 2]","Since the recent 9/11 anniversary and the September 10, 2012 NY Times article entitled ""The Deafness Before the Storm"" by Kurt Eichenwald, I've revisited a few documentaries on the subject.  Most of them are either so amateurishly done that they are hard to take seriously or they don't answer enough of the right questions.  This one is different.  Anyone who has read ""Crossing the Rubicon"" by Mike Ruppert or who has followed him over the years will have a good idea of what they're getting in ""The Truth and Lies of 9/11.""  A former Los Angeles Police Detective with a great analytical mind, a good memory and the willingness to sit down, read and think, Mike Ruppert pieces together information that (IMO) would make any reasonably thinking person's jaw drop.  He easily sources his information because it's all public.  There are neither top secret documents that only he is privy to nor are there any `deep throats' that lurk behind dark corners (lol).  All of the info he sources any of us could gain access to if we were so inclined to look for it.This is not a flashy, tabloid-esque video -- -- it is a lecture at a university, so please do not let the cover or the somewhat crude quality of the video dissuade viewing.  In my opinion, the information in this documentary is ghastly though important.  Whatever you make of if it is up to you; just keep in mind the following statement while watching:  from the Groucho and Chico Marx silent movie Duck Soup, ""Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?""",5,A Revisit...,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,1520,"['recent', '9/11', 'anniversary', 'September', '10', '2012', 'NY', 'Times', 'article', 'entitled', 'Deafness', 'Storm', 'Kurt', 'Eichenwald', ""'ve"", 'revisited', 'few', 'documentaries', 'subject', 'Most', 'are', 'so', 'amateurishly', 'done', 'are', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'answer', 'enough', 'right', 'questions', 'one', 'different', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'Crossing', 'Rubicon', 'Mike', 'Ruppert', 'who', 'followed', 'years', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'Truth', 'Lies', '9/11', 'former', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Police', 'Detective', 'great', 'analytical', 'mind', 'good', 'memory', 'willingness', 'sit', 'down', 'read', 'think', 'Mike', 'Ruppert', 'together', 'information', 'IMO', 'would', 'make', 'reasonably', 'thinking', 'person', 'jaw', 'drop', 'easily', 'sources', 'information', 'public', 'are', 'top', 'secret', 'documents', 'only', 'privy', 'are', 'there', 'deep', 'throats', 'lurk', 'dark', 'corners', 'lol', 'info', 'sources', 'could', 'gain', 'access', 'were', 'so', 'inclined', 'look', 'it.This', 'not', 'flashy', 'tabloid-esque', 'video', 'lecture', 'university', 'so', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'cover', 'somewhat', 'crude', 'quality', 'video', 'dissuade', 'viewing', 'opinion', 'information', 'documentary', 'ghastly', 'important', 'make', 'up', 'just', 'keep', 'mind', 'following', 'statement', 'watching', 'Groucho', 'Chico', 'Marx', 'silent', 'movie', 'Duck', 'Soup', 'Who', 'are', 'going', 'believe', 'own', 'eyes']",The Truth and Lies of 9-11

1092683,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B000TZ0JZM,Howard M. Kindel,"[45, 50]","Regardless who engineered ""911,"" it's become clear over the years that the tragedy quickly became a means to an end.  Mike Ruppert, like most others who have investigated aspects of ""911,"" concludes that American hegemony in Eurasia, and particularly in the Middle East, was that end.  But there's another, a much subtler means to an end contained within ""The Truth and Lies of 911"" - one of Ruppert's own making.  And everything he says about ""911"" leads to that end. He's obsessed with a presumed CIA connection to the international drug trade; he was an LAPD narcotics detective who was driven from the Police Department because he made waves about that very thing.  So, even though he understandably concludes that ""911"" became a means of capturing Middle Eastern oil, natural gas and pipeline routes, he's just as adamant that ""911"" was also a means of re-capturing the Afghanistani opium trade - which the Taliban virtually eliminated.  It is Ruppert's belief that the profits from this drug trade is primarily what keeps the American economy from collapsing.  In fact, his comments on the economy are the most compelling part of the entire two and a half hour presentation; and his brief introductory comments - which date from 2004 - are eerily prescient.  It's as if he's giving a news report on the recent banking crisis.  That alone earns this film at least five-stars - and helps counter-balance what might otherwise be written off as merely a personal vendetta against the CIA.",5,Means To An End,1253750400,"09 24, 2009",2009,1490,"['Regardless', 'who', 'engineered', '911', 'become', 'clear', 'years', 'tragedy', 'quickly', 'became', 'means', 'end', 'Mike', 'Ruppert', 'most', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'investigated', 'aspects', '911', 'American', 'hegemony', 'Eurasia', 'particularly', 'Middle', 'East', 'was', 'end', 'much', 'subtler', 'end', 'contained', 'Truth', 'Lies', '911', 'one', 'Ruppert', 'own', 'making', 'everything', '911', 'end', 'obsessed', 'presumed', 'CIA', 'connection', 'international', 'drug', 'trade', 'was', 'LAPD', 'narcotics', 'detective', 'who', 'was', 'driven', 'Police', 'Department', 'made', 'waves', 'very', 'thing', 'So', 'even', 'understandably', '911', 'became', 'means', 'capturing', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'oil', 'natural', 'gas', 'pipeline', 'routes', 'just', 'as', 'adamant', '911', 'was', 'also', 'means', 're-capturing', 'Afghanistani', 'opium', 'trade', 'Taliban', 'virtually', 'eliminated', 'Ruppert', 'belief', 'profits', 'drug', 'trade', 'primarily', 'what', 'American', 'economy', 'collapsing', 'fact', 'comments', 'economy', 'are', 'most', 'compelling', 'part', 'entire', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'presentation', 'brief', 'introductory', 'comments', 'date', '2004', 'are', 'eerily', 'prescient', 'giving', 'news', 'report', 'recent', 'banking', 'crisis', 'alone', 'film', 'least', 'five-stars', 'counter-balance', 'what', 'might', 'otherwise', 'be', 'written', 'off', 'merely', 'personal', 'vendetta', 'CIA']",The Truth and Lies of 9-11
