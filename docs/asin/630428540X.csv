411276,AK6UVFSU07NXH,630428540X,Anthony Hinde,"[1, 2]","I desperately wanted to see Phenomenon after I had seen its preview. The story of a man who mysteriously starts to change into a genius but retains his humanity, sounded too good to miss.  It's nice to find a film with a  bit of soul in this day and age.There seemed to be a little  controversy concerning the fact that Travolta played the lead. Apparently  by belonging to the Church of Scientology some people mistakenly believed  that his character was a portrayal of that organization's ideal human. Even  if it were true I would have thought this would bring more people to their  doors rather than less.George Malley, (Travolta), is a small town  motor mechanic, a likable man who is struggling to learn Spanish whilst  trying to work up the courage to ask Lace, a reclusive single mother, (Kyra  Sedgwick), out on a date.  But his sedate life changes dramatically when on  the evening of his birthday he sees lights in the sky and blacks out. From  then on he finds it almost impossible to sleep and his friends start to  notice differences in him.His intelligence is amazing enough but  when he shows talents in less conventional areas, many of the town's folks  become nervous and even afraid. Despite the fact that he is doing nothing  but good, they begin to draw away from him. All that is, except Nate,  (Forest Witaker), his best friend, the town doctor, (Robert Duval), and  Lace. The three of them manage to see the beauty within the man. That  constant part of him that has not changed and is even more remarkable than  his new abilities.The film takes a darker turn when the  government steps in and takes George away for testing. As the mood is  plunged into chilled water and his future begins to look bleaker, we are  warmed by the support of Doc and the love of his, by now, girlfriend Lace.  This movie has the power to reaffirm a positive life and maybe even reverse  a negative one.

411280,ASYM4A70K9OMU,630428540X,beachbutterfly,"[5, 8]","Confusion. Nauseating. Touching. Homey. Four words I'd use to describe the movie known as ""Phenomenon"", one that I watched yesturday during my psychology class. Why the confusion, why the nausea? Perhaps because I wasn't expecting this movie...I didn't even know what it was called. But aside from that, and aside from looking at a scientific explanation, this movie exceeds on most standards. What fooled me at the beginning surprised me near the end; towards the beginning I was feeling almost stupid watching this because there was no scientific explanation for what was happening. A man sees a bright light and the next day wakes up a genius. He seems oblivious to wanting to know why this happens to him but instead choses to go with the flow and, after sensing the beginnings of an earth quake, seems at a loss and seeks for answers to his newly developed questions when all begins to go downhill.I won't go into too much detail about what happens next but for the most part of the movie, I was in a state of confusion. Why was Travolta feeling like this? What happened to him? And most importantly, why doesn't he seem concerned when everybody else in his know-all town is? I think that, coupled with the small-town feeling (which makes me feel nauseas at times) and the irritating music made me feel out of the loop while everybody else around me was oohing and awing over Travolta's performence.Towards the end, I was feeling a little bit more reassured. There are some touching scenes but Travolta's great performence more than makes up for the confusion surrounding his diagnosis. His love interest (who's name I cannot recall at the moment) does an outstanding performence as a torn bystander who doesn't know what else to do but simply watch her friend break apart day by day. Altough Travolta's diagnosis is truly devastating, it's wonderful to watch how he deals with it...and I think that's where this movie excels, the point it's trying to make and the point I missed entirely (perhaps because I was expecting more of a scientifically visioned film). This movie isn't about psychology or about earning 200 IQ points over night - it's about being the outcast, being the scum of society, being the freak of nature...and learning how to deal with it.",4,Down to earth,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,2264,"['Confusion', 'Nauseating', 'Touching', 'Homey', 'Four', 'words', ""'d"", 'use', 'describe', 'movie', 'known', 'Phenomenon', 'one', 'watched', 'yesturday', 'psychology', 'class', 'Why', 'confusion', 'why', 'nausea', 'Perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'called', 'aside', 'aside', 'looking', 'scientific', 'explanation', 'movie', 'most', 'standards', 'What', 'fooled', 'beginning', 'surprised', 'end', 'beginning', 'was', 'feeling', 'almost', 'stupid', 'watching', 'was', 'scientific', 'explanation', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'man', 'bright', 'light', 'next', 'day', 'up', 'genius', 'oblivious', 'wanting', 'know', 'why', 'instead', 'choses', 'go', 'flow', 'sensing', 'beginnings', 'earth', 'quake', 'loss', 'seeks', 'answers', 'newly', 'developed', 'questions', 'when', 'go', 'downhill.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'what', 'next', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'state', 'confusion', 'Why', 'was', 'Travolta', 'feeling', 'What', 'happened', 'most', 'importantly', 'why', ""n't"", 'seem', 'concerned', 'when', 'everybody', 'else', 'know-all', 'town', 'think', 'coupled', 'small-town', 'feeling', 'feel', 'nauseas', 'times', 'irritating', 'music', 'made', 'feel', 'loop', 'everybody', 'else', 'was', 'oohing', 'awing', 'over', 'Travolta', 'performence.Towards', 'end', 'was', 'feeling', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'reassured', 'are', 'touching', 'scenes', 'Travolta', 'great', 'performence', 'more', 'up', 'confusion', 'surrounding', 'diagnosis', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'name', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'moment', 'outstanding', 'performence', 'torn', 'bystander', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'simply', 'watch', 'friend', 'break', 'apart', 'day', 'day', 'Altough', 'Travolta', 'diagnosis', 'truly', 'devastating', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'how', 'think', 'where', 'movie', 'point', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'missed', 'entirely', 'perhaps', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'scientifically', 'visioned', 'film', 'movie', ""n't"", 'about', 'psychology', 'earning', '200', 'IQ', 'points', 'night', 'being', 'outcast', 'being', 'scum', 'society', 'being', 'freak', 'nature', 'learning', 'how', 'deal']",Phenomenon VHS

I didn't try to take it too seriously, as I fell in love with George, the Dr., and Lace.  George genuinely cares about his friends.  The Dr., played wonderfully by the great Robert Duvall, understands people, and Lace is over the top sexy ( like some jewish women I have known...can Sedgwick be a jewish name?)  I thought the writing was great.  How about George teaching Nate the portuguese language?  Marvelous!  The little details and cinematography were very well done in this picture.  Kudos to the writer, director, and the guys behind the cameras.An added bonus is the soundtrack, which throughly enhances the movie at every turn.  Well done.

It is easy to get caught up in the love story, and in the wonderfully nice George Malley (as all his friends do), but every piece of ""knowledge"" in this film is as whacked out as Lace Pennamin's stupid chairs.At first, when the light hits George, we buy into something unearthly has given him these powers, but when the truth is revealed late into the movie, well, let me say that what happened to George does not and cannot happen from what the story has happen to him.  If you have ever had that in your family, as I have, you know what really happens and it is not, EVER, an increase in mental ability, let alone something as impossibly fanciful as telekinesis.Then there is the whole sinister government thing.  Why do this?  Why is it necessary that the government is out to enslave us by keeping us ignorant and stupid and yet if we dare rise above the enforced mediocrity, they want to take us away?  This is even dumber than the asserted reason for George's abilities.Even so, I like every character in George's town, especially Duvall's Doc Brunder and Whitaker's Nate Pope.  It is the quality of their acting and commitment to this story that makes the film work at all.  When I first saw it, I suspended belief and common sense all the way until the George finds out about the source of his powers.  Then I got annoyed and the feeling kept increasing all the way to the end.

Is it a U.F.O. or is this country  bumpkin seeing things?

411301,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,630428540X,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 1]","Back in 1996, filmmaker Jon Turteltaub would go on to work on his latest film ""Phenomenon"" after coming off two successful films, ""While You Were Sleeping"" (1995) and ""Cool Runnings"" (1993).With a story written by Gerald Di Pego (""Message in a Bottle"", ""Instinct""), the film would star John Travolta (""Get Shorty"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Saturday Night Fever"", ""Grease""), Kyra Sedgwick (""The Closer"", ""Gamer""), Forest Whitaker (""Platoon"", ""The Last King of Scotland"", ""Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai"") and Robert Duvall (""The Godfather"" films, ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Deep Impact"").The film was a success in the box office.  Budgeted at $32 million, ""Phenomenon"" would earn over $152 million in the box office.  And having been released on VHS and DVD in the past, ""Phenomenon"" will now be released on Blu-ray courtesy of Touchstone Entertainment.VIDEO:""Phenomenon"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  Video quality is very good and features an all-new digital restoration.  There are detail and more clarity when closeups of the characters are seen, from the stubble on John Travolta to clothing.  Vibrant colors are much more evident than the previous DVD release which looked softer, so this Blu-ray release is an upgrade over the original DVD.  Skin tones are natural, black levels are nice and deep and I didn't notice any edge enhancement, artifacts, banding or any video problems during my viewing of the film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Phenomenon"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.  The soundtrack is primarily dialogue with the occasional music that can be heard through the surround channels.  But the most where you do hear surround channels being utilized is for ambiance during crowd scenes or when George is being struck by the light.  But for a film such as ""Phenomenon"", lossless audio is appropriate, dialogue is crystal clear as with the music for the film.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Phenomenon"" comes with the original theatrical trailer.JUDGMENT CALL:One day you are a normal man.  The next day, you realize you have special abilities.""Phenomenon"" was a film that rather intriguing when it first came out.  A sci-fi film that captivated viewers for its take on one man's special ability and enhanced intelligence due to being struck by light.  Is it a supernatural phenomenon or something health related?  And despite using his abilities for good, it starts to make friends and residents of the town scared of him.This is the premise of ""Phenomenon"".  And while there have been a few films that have similar storylines, one thing that people have felt about ""Phenomenon"" is its correlation to Travolta's dedication to the Church of Scientology (which he would followup several years later in the film ""Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000&#8243;).But the correlation is the belief that all people have special abilities but must go through steps or changes in one's life in wanting to achieve clarity, free of the past and knowing that you are part of something much bigger than humanity.The religious correlation was discussed a lot back in the mid-'90s but in the case of this film, it's a film that tries to stay safe without being polemic.  The character of George Malley is a good guy who wants his abilities to help people, but because people are not sure how to react to his new abilities, many wonder if he is an extra-terrestrial, faking his abilities or what.  There is no explanation.  And so the film tries to play things quite safe with George being worried about how others think about him.Sure, we get the U.S. government storyline included (and I can't mention any more than that without spoiling the storyline) but if anything, the film tries to focus on the positive.  May it be his relationship to his friends, the people in the village to the one woman that George has liked.  The film doesn't stray away from the good nature of its character, so for those hoping for something drastic or even integration of action sequences, this is not that type of film.It's a straightforward sci-fi film with an interesting concept of what is causing George's abilities, but other than that, writer Gerald Di Pego plays it safe with the screenplay.  And to the benefit of ""Phenomenon"", it's a film that has a stellar cast and a filmmaker who just came off directing the successful romantic comedy, ""While You Were Sleeping"".  But the film was too simple for me and I felt it could have been much better.The Blu-ray release does look very good on Blu-ray thanks to its new digital restoration and the lossless soundtrack sounds very good as well.  But unfortunately, aside from the theatrical trailer, there are no special features included.Overall, ""Phenomenon"" could have been a different film.  I suppose focusing on George's supernatural abilities would make this almost to a superhero film and this is not what the film is all about.  For those wanting a simple storyline without the complexities of other sci-fi films, ""Phenomenon"" may be for you!

Eret,"[48, 53]","I took me awhile to catch on to the John Travolta &quot;comeback.&quot; Always a good actor, he is trancendent in &quot;Phenomenon.&quot; Taking his character of George, struck by a mysterious light, and turning him from  an average man to a genius, could have been an actor's trap. Travolta makes  it his triumph. He gives George such a humanity that even with the genius  powers we are aware that George of old is still there, trying to  desparately to just be his old self, and only the girl he longs for, played  excellently by Kyra Segwick seems to understand his wanting to remain the  same, no matter how many &quot;miracles&quot; he performs. So many films  like this are too serious, use too many special effects, or are just plain  ridiculous. Travolta great performance seems to lift the entire genre and  wins us over like he does Segwick and her two children. The supporting cast  is excellent, especially Robert Duvall, who does miraculous things with the  town doctor. Forrest Whittiker is also good as George's best friend. The  town accepts the miracles like no other movie town does. Yes, they are in  awe, but they still doubt, as George doubts, that he was given a gift as a  mistake, but when all is said and done, we know the &quot;bright  light&quot; made the right choice, that he was able to even handle his own  mortality. There is a scene near the end of the movie, when George is  sharing his last moments and an apple with the two young children, that is  as moving as any I've seen in recent memory. Some may see  &quot;Phenomenon&quot; as too far-fetched or mauldlin, and if so they are  as jaded as many movie goers are getting. What does an audience want? Here  is a movie without much violence, blood, or spectacular special effects and  does have a message but does not force it on you, how all of us have the  possibility to be more than we think, that there is genius on a small  scale, in the feelings for love, simple pleasures, sharing an apple with  children, or facing one's own mortality without fear.

His concentration is better. He is able to retain what he reads. He has lots of bright ideas. Along with all of this, though, he cannot sleep. He spends all night reading and coming up with gadgets and theories. Most of them work.His friends notice things are different but they cannot shake the ideal of a dull George Malley. His intelligence makes them a bit jealous and then even frightens them. This is especially true when he manages to learn Portuguese in half and hour in order to save a lost child with food poisoning. They are sure they are afraid when he exhibits some telekinesis. Rumors abound.Most of the rumors center around the UFO George saw on the night of his change. That makes things scarier.George falls in love with a single mom and has a hard time winning her over. Eventually, though, he does because she can see his good heart. This is about the time that he comes under scrutiny from academic and government types. The academics want to study him and the government is frightened because they cannot control him.

This enables him to read quickly, comprehend, think clearly and even perform minor telekinesis.  In the small town in which he lives this sort of thing can cause some problems and fear.

He is now obsessed with knowledge, of learning, and he's a little telekinetic to boot.  How this affects him and the people in his small town overrides the obligatory governmental intervention subplot.  Travolta is marvelous and so is the rest of the cast: Kyra Sedgwick as the relation-phobic young mother who is the object of Travolta's affections; Robert Duvall is superb as the doctor/friend who tries to get Travolta through this change; Forest Whitaker as his farmer buddy.  In fact, the whole cast is right on target in support of this remarkable leading performance.  PHENOMENON is touching, and offers a look at how Travolta's friends find themselves both in awe and in fear of his newfound powers.",5,MOVING TRIBUTE TO THE HUMAN SPIRIT,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,1122,"['PHENOMENON', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'syrupy', 'maudlin-filled', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'been', 'handed', 'thanks', 'intelligent', 'script', 'astute', 'direction', 'Jon', 'Turteltaub', 'stunning', 'cast', 'movie', 'poignant', 'touching', 'affirmative', 'nod', 'human', 'spirit', 'John', 'Travolta', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'George', 'auto', 'mechanic', 'who', 'one', 'night', 'bright', 'light', 'stunned', 'up', 'changed', 'now', 'obsessed', 'knowledge', 'learning', 'little', 'telekinetic', 'boot', 'How', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'obligatory', 'governmental', 'intervention', 'subplot', 'Travolta', 'marvelous', 'so', 'rest', 'cast', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'relation-phobic', 'young', 'mother', 'who', 'object', 'Travolta', 'affections', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'superb', 'doctor/friend', 'who', 'get', 'Travolta', 'change', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'farmer', 'buddy', 'fact', 'whole', 'cast', 'right', 'target', 'support', 'remarkable', 'leading', 'performance', 'PHENOMENON', 'touching', 'look', 'how', 'Travolta', 'friends', 'find', 'awe', 'fear', 'newfound', 'powers']",Phenomenon VHS

411349,A34X9EZTTQR7R7,630428540X,"MK ""Hussar""","[4, 4]","George Malley (John Travolta) is an affable, easy-going auto mechanic in a sleepy American town.  He has become smitten by Lace (Kyra Sedgwick), a ferociously-independent and emotionally guarded single mother who manufacturers chairs in an even more remote location than the town itself.  George's bumbling attempts at piquing her interest continually fail, yet he remains optimistic, even after she rebuffs him for his 37th birthday party.Remonstrated by his long-time friend Nate (Forest Whitaker) that he shouldn't be purchasing his own drinks at his own birthday party, George wanders outside, where he has a most unusual encounter--perhaps even of the ""first"" and ""close"" variety.  Rendered senseless by the experience, he soon recovers and heads back inside the bar, where his pals continue their celebrations and chuckle as he tells his story.  Later that night, George lies awake, pressured thoughts consuming his mind.  Suddenly, he bolts out of his useless bed as a surprising illumination enters his brain:  he now knows exactly how the darned rabbit keeps getting in his fenced-off garden!There are so many undercurrent messages socked away in this movie, it is a wonder the director, Jon Turteltaub (""Instinct,"" ""National Treasure""), remembered to film the thing.  It is a testament to this director's subtlety that these messages come across as gentle and graceful reminders of life's beauty, rather than as annoying platitudes meant to placate the unwashed masses.  A few examples, and I have doubtless missed many:  ""sometimes remarkable things happen to unremarkable people,"" ""every person's life belongs to a greater whole,"" ""judge not with haste,"" ""information is power,"" ""humans possess near-unlimited potential,"" and ""love can be everything.""  I tend to view the cramming of acceptable moral precepts down an audience's collective throat--during something meant as entertainment--to be a particularly sad method by which Hollywood demonstrates its humanity; however, this tactic is not being employed here.*minor spoilers/plot points below*We are witness to George coming to grips with his new-found powers.  His rise in the community from country gentleman to powerful entity is shown clearly through the eyes of the audience, who exhibit very believable reactions:  fear, humility, puzzlement, and, that most cursed of double-edged swords, worship.  He witnesses friends drifting away, metamorphing into disciples, or being shamed into silence because of their perceived intellectual inadequacy.  George becomes slave to these myriad new ideas filling his brain, preventing sleep, self-care, and respite.  He involves himself in a cipher ""game"" on the short-wave radio belonging to Nate, and ultimately provokes very highly-placed unwanted attention, indeed.  George wonders why all his newfound abilities help him not at all in his quest to pierce Lace's heart.  He invents many rude implements, which yet work spectacularly well in their functions.  A seismologist from Berkley, visiting Mr. Malley to verify his ability to ""sense"" ULF (ultra-low frequency) emissions--which herald the arrival of an earthquake--is swept along on a scavenger hunt of sorts for an extremely sick local boy.*end minor spoilers/plot points*There are far, far too many ideas explored in this movie, but it succeeds anyway.  Travolta is not fantastically convincing in the beginning; yet he, like George, becomes more and more remarkable (and thus, believable) as the movie progresses.  The gentle way he informs Lace that ""it's happening,"" made me want to switch the movie off, so real it seemed.  Kyra is absolutely convincing, as always.  I fell in love with her character at least five separate times in the movie.  Robert Duvall and Forest Whitaker also steal many scenes with their requisite skill.  Mr. Duvall's outburst in the pub towards movie's end stunned me into silence.  Forest's performance as socially-stunted introvert, incapable of expressing his feelings towards women, was totally on the money.  I'm sorry I waited nearly eleven years to see this movie.  It touched my mind and my heart by the end--just as Malley's experience touched his, and those of the people he loved.  This was a beautiful and worthwhile movie.  Sometimes ""star-studded"" yields something truly memorable:  here is that movie.",4,"Much, much more than a simple vehicle for Travolta's 15th comeback",1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,4321,"['George', 'Malley', 'John', 'Travolta', 'affable', 'easy-going', 'auto', 'mechanic', 'sleepy', 'American', 'town', 'become', 'smitten', 'Lace', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'ferociously-independent', 'emotionally', 'guarded', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'manufacturers', 'chairs', 'even', 'more', 'remote', 'location', 'town', 'George', 'bumbling', 'attempts', 'piquing', 'interest', 'continually', 'fail', 'yet', 'optimistic', 'even', 'rebuffs', '37th', 'birthday', 'party.Remonstrated', 'long-time', 'friend', 'Nate', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'purchasing', 'own', 'drinks', 'own', 'birthday', 'party', 'George', 'wanders', 'outside', 'where', 'most', 'unusual', 'encounter', 'perhaps', 'even', 'first', 'close', 'variety', 'Rendered', 'senseless', 'experience', 'soon', 'recovers', 'heads', 'back', 'bar', 'where', 'pals', 'continue', 'celebrations', 'chuckle', 'story', 'Later', 'night', 'George', 'awake', 'pressured', 'thoughts', 'consuming', 'mind', 'Suddenly', 'bolts', 'useless', 'bed', 'surprising', 'illumination', 'enters', 'brain', 'now', 'exactly', 'how', 'darned', 'rabbit', 'keeps', 'getting', 'fenced-off', 'garden', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'undercurrent', 'messages', 'socked', 'away', 'movie', 'wonder', 'director', 'Jon', 'Turteltaub', 'Instinct', 'National', 'Treasure', 'remembered', 'film', 'thing', 'testament', 'director', 'subtlety', 'messages', 'come', 'gentle', 'graceful', 'reminders', 'life', 'beauty', 'rather', 'annoying', 'platitudes', 'meant', 'placate', 'unwashed', 'masses', 'few', 'examples', 'have', 'doubtless', 'missed', 'many', 'sometimes', 'remarkable', 'things', 'happen', 'unremarkable', 'people', 'person', 'life', 'greater', 'whole', 'judge', 'not', 'haste', 'information', 'power', 'humans', 'possess', 'near-unlimited', 'potential', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'everything', 'tend', 'view', 'cramming', 'acceptable', 'moral', 'precepts', 'down', 'audience', 'collective', 'throat', 'something', 'meant', 'entertainment', 'be', 'particularly', 'sad', 'method', 'Hollywood', 'humanity', 'however', 'tactic', 'not', 'being', 'employed', 'here', '*minor', 'spoilers/plot', 'points', 'are', 'witness', 'George', 'coming', 'grips', 'new-found', 'powers', 'rise', 'community', 'country', 'gentleman', 'powerful', 'entity', 'shown', 'clearly', 'eyes', 'audience', 'who', 'exhibit', 'very', 'believable', 'reactions', 'fear', 'humility', 'puzzlement', 'most', 'cursed', 'double-edged', 'swords', 'worship', 'friends', 'drifting', 'away', 'metamorphing', 'disciples', 'being', 'shamed', 'silence', 'perceived', 'intellectual', 'inadequacy', 'George', 'slave', 'myriad', 'new', 'ideas', 'filling', 'brain', 'preventing', 'sleep', 'self-care', 'respite', 'cipher', 'game', 'short-wave', 'radio', 'belonging', 'Nate', 'ultimately', 'provokes', 'very', 'highly-placed', 'unwanted', 'attention', 'indeed', 'George', 'wonders', 'why', 'newfound', 'abilities', 'help', 'not', 'quest', 'pierce', 'Lace', 'heart', 'many', 'rude', 'implements', 'yet', 'work', 'spectacularly', 'well', 'functions', 'seismologist', 'Berkley', 'visiting', 'Mr.', 'Malley', 'verify', 'ability', 'sense', 'ULF', 'ultra-low', 'frequency', 'emissions', 'herald', 'arrival', 'earthquake', 'swept', 'along', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'sorts', 'extremely', 'sick', 'local', 'boy', '*end', 'minor', 'spoilers/plot', 'are', 'far', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'ideas', 'explored', 'movie', 'anyway', 'Travolta', 'not', 'fantastically', 'convincing', 'beginning', 'George', 'more', 'more', 'remarkable', 'thus', 'believable', 'movie', 'gentle', 'way', 'Lace', 'happening', 'made', 'want', 'switch', 'movie', 'off', 'so', 'real', 'seemed', 'Kyra', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'always', 'fell', 'love', 'character', 'least', 'five', 'separate', 'times', 'movie', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'also', 'steal', 'many', 'scenes', 'requisite', 'skill', 'Mr.', 'Duvall', 'outburst', 'pub', 'movie', 'end', 'stunned', 'silence', 'Forest', 'performance', 'socially-stunted', 'introvert', 'incapable', 'expressing', 'feelings', 'towards', 'women', 'was', 'totally', 'money', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'waited', 'nearly', 'eleven', 'years', 'see', 'movie', 'touched', 'mind', 'heart', 'end', 'just', 'Malley', 'experience', 'touched', 'people', 'loved', 'was', 'beautiful', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'star-studded', 'yields', 'something', 'truly', 'memorable', 'here', 'movie']",Phenomenon VHS

When a friend recommended it to me recently, I reluctantly watched it.I found  it to be one of the most interesting movies I have seen in years.  The  &quot;magical&quot; events do not dominate the story as I thought they  would.  Instead, we see the reaction that  heightened peceptivity and  sensibility provoke in the general population when they appear in one  special person.Travolta's abilities appear magical, but there is a  rational reason for them, and that plays a key role in the movie.  (I do  not want to give the plot away).  I noticed a key bit of dialogue involving  D.H. Lawrence and &quot;Lady Chatterly's Lover,&quot; making me aware that  the writer was very familiar with the essence of the novel.  In fact, the  movie reminded me of the perceptivity of D.H.L. and the reception his  novels, poems, and essays got from the general public. His sensitivity, I  am sure, was enhanced by his struggle with the dire circumstances of his  life, as is Travolta's.The story is enhanced by the pairing of two  people who are hurting from the blows life has dealt them.  In a pleasant  change from the habit modern movies have of having lovers couple &quot;in  the first reel&quot; so to speak, this couple has first to work through  their problems and hesitations before they can become intimate. To me their  progress in getting to know each other slowly and trustingly was realistic  and inspiring.Spectacular UFO effects and mind-bending tricks do not  dominate this video; in fact, they scarcely enter. What we have is a  fascinating study of a &quot;different&quot; human being and his convoluted  interactions with conventional society.",5,"A thought-provoking, surprisingly fascinating video.",914198400,"12 21, 1998",1998,1794,"['have', 'avoided', 'seeing', 'movie', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'was', 'impression', 'was', 'UFO', 'telekinesis', 'like', 'When', 'friend', 'recommended', 'recently', 'reluctantly', 'watched', 'it.I', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'quot', 'magical', 'quot', 'events', 'do', 'not', 'dominate', 'story', 'thought', 'would', 'Instead', 'see', 'reaction', 'heightened', 'peceptivity', 'sensibility', 'provoke', 'general', 'population', 'when', 'appear', 'one', 'special', 'person.Travolta', 'abilities', 'appear', 'magical', 'rational', 'reason', 'key', 'role', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'plot', 'away', 'noticed', 'key', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'involving', 'D.H.', 'Lawrence', 'quot', 'Lady', 'Chatterly', 'Lover', 'quot', 'making', 'aware', 'writer', 'was', 'very', 'familiar', 'essence', 'novel', 'fact', 'movie', 'reminded', 'perceptivity', 'D.H.L', 'reception', 'novels', 'poems', 'essays', 'got', 'general', 'public', 'sensitivity', 'am', 'sure', 'was', 'enhanced', 'struggle', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'life', ""Travolta's.The"", 'story', 'enhanced', 'pairing', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'hurting', 'blows', 'life', 'dealt', 'pleasant', 'change', 'habit', 'modern', 'movies', 'have', 'having', 'lovers', 'couple', 'quot', 'first', 'reel', 'quot', 'so', 'speak', 'couple', 'first', 'work', 'problems', 'hesitations', 'can', 'become', 'intimate', 'progress', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'slowly', 'trustingly', 'was', 'realistic', 'inspiring.Spectacular', 'UFO', 'effects', 'mind-bending', 'tricks', 'do', 'not', 'dominate', 'video', 'fact', 'scarcely', 'enter', 'What', 'have', 'fascinating', 'study', 'quot', 'different', 'quot', 'human', 'being', 'convoluted', 'interactions', 'conventional', 'society']",Phenomenon VHS

411374,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,630428540X,Wuchak,"[0, 1]","John Travolta's ""Phenomenon"" from 1996 is similar to ""Powder"", which came out some eight months earlier. Both films are about a gifted individual with unusual powers and the reactions of those around him. ""Phenomenon"" differs from ""Powder"" in that it's about a regular guy (Travolta) who suddenly gains amazing abilities, rather than an outcast who already has them.The other characters include a woman whom he wants to date (Kyra Sedgwick), his best friend (Forest Whitaker), his doctor (Robert Duvall), a marveling professor and miscellaneous townsfolk & government agents. The story takes place in a small town in Northern California (shot in Auburn, CA).This is an interesting ""What if?"" story. What would happen if an average Joe suddenly attained genius and telekinesis? The film explores the untapped power of the mind and spirit. What great things would we be able to do if we were able to tap into this vast reservoir of potential! The ordinary person might likely respond with skepticism, but the story is based on numerous real-life examples, albeit perhaps not as pronounced as Travolta's character.I've had my own run-ins with such things. For instance, about five years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire (or heat). The intense energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I woke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy?Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition.It goes without saying that ""Phenomenon"" is worthwhile just for effectively exploring such amazing things and provoking thought.Travolta's character is somewhat of a type of Christ in the story, which makes the ending a bit unsatisfying. I don't want to say too much (no spoilers), but the question arises: If he possesses the genius and power to do all that he does in the film, why couldn't he use these powers to deal with a certain situation at the end? To me, the writers and filmmakers took the easy way out by giving us a ""realistic"" ending. In short, they played it safe.Still, this is a good movie if you like dramas and the subject matter piques your interest.The film runs 123 minutes.GRADE: B",4,The untapped power of the mind and spirit,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,3075,"['John', 'Travolta', 'Phenomenon', '1996', 'similar', 'Powder', 'came', 'out', 'eight', 'months', 'earlier', 'films', 'are', 'gifted', 'individual', 'unusual', 'powers', 'reactions', 'Phenomenon', 'differs', 'Powder', 'regular', 'guy', 'Travolta', 'who', 'suddenly', 'gains', 'amazing', 'abilities', 'rather', 'outcast', 'who', 'already', 'them.The', 'other', 'characters', 'include', 'woman', 'whom', 'date', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'best', 'friend', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'doctor', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'marveling', 'professor', 'miscellaneous', 'townsfolk', 'government', 'agents', 'story', 'place', 'small', 'town', 'Northern', 'California', 'shot', 'Auburn', 'CA', '.This', 'interesting', 'What', 'story', 'What', 'would', 'happen', 'average', 'Joe', 'suddenly', 'attained', 'genius', 'telekinesis', 'film', 'untapped', 'power', 'mind', 'spirit', 'What', 'great', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'were', 'able', 'tap', 'vast', 'reservoir', 'potential', 'ordinary', 'person', 'might', 'likely', 'respond', 'skepticism', 'story', 'based', 'numerous', 'real-life', 'examples', 'perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'pronounced', 'Travolta', 'character.I', ""'ve"", 'had', 'own', 'run-ins', 'such', 'things', 'instance', 'about', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'bed', 'having', 'intense', 'dream', 'when', 'wife', 'burst', 'room', 'wake', 'up', 'smoke', 'alarm', 'door', 'was', 'blaring', 'crazy', 'was', 'smoke', 'fire', 'heat', 'intense', 'energy', 'evoked', 'dream', 'obviously', 'set', 'off', 'because', 'as', 'soon', 'woke', 'suddenly', 'stopped', 'was', 'doubt', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'next', 'week', 'What', 'can', 'explain', 'untapped', 'power', 'mind', 'focused', 'energy', 'example', 'mind', 'albeit', 'different', 'when', 'was', 'around', '8', 'years', 'old', 'family', 'were', 'walking', 'trails', 'Theodore', 'Wirth', 'Park', 'Minneapolis', 'when', 'came', 'edge', 'baseball', 'field', 'As', 'soon', 'entered', 'outfield', 'somehow', 'just', 'knew', 'current', 'batter', 'was', 'going', 'hit', 'ball', 'was', 'going', 'hit', 'right', 'face', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'knew', 'just', 'knew', 'Next', 'thing', 'know', 'batter', 'ball', 'high', 'air', 'was', 'slow', 'motion', 'came', 'hit', 'right', 'cheek', 'Good', 'thing', 'was', 'softball', 'huh', 'How', 'did', 'KNOW', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'power', 'mind', 'spirit', 'warn', 'call', 'intuition.It', 'saying', 'Phenomenon', 'worthwhile', 'just', 'effectively', 'exploring', 'such', 'amazing', 'things', 'provoking', 'thought.Travolta', 'character', 'somewhat', 'type', 'Christ', 'story', 'ending', 'bit', 'unsatisfying', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'spoilers', 'question', 'genius', 'power', 'do', 'film', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'use', 'powers', 'deal', 'certain', 'situation', 'end', 'writers', 'filmmakers', 'took', 'easy', 'way', 'giving', 'realistic', 'ending', 'short', 'played', 'safe.Still', 'good', 'movie', 'like', 'dramas', 'subject', 'matter', 'piques', 'interest.The', 'film', '123', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B']",Phenomenon VHS
