950215,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000BUE5D2,Taheen Lopez,"[4, 5]","This 1984-85 Season DVD is mighty cool and my favorite season throughout KNIGHT RIDER's whole 4-year run on NBC, especially since every episode on this DVD is complete and uncut like they all were originally shown when KNIGHT RIDER was on NBC every Sunday many years ago, but they took a lot of the sound effects out in many scenes of the episodes, like they did in the episodes ""Knight Of The Chameleon"" and ""Knightlines"" for instance, but if you watch those same episodes on the KNIGHT RIDER-The Complete Series DVD that Universal released in the Fall of 2008, you'll notice a difference and hear the sound effects in every single scene like they should be, which was probably something else that prompted Universal to make and release the KNIGHT RIDER-The Complete Series DVD box set by redoing each episode on single-sided discs instead of putting them on double-sided discs like they did on this KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 3 DVD box set along with all the other individual season box sets, which made a lot of episodes freeze and skip a lot in those box sets, especially in the KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 2 DVD box set and the KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 4 DVD box set since the episodes ""Knightmares"", ""Knight Song"", ""White-Line Warriors"", and ""Deadly Knightshade"" froze and skipped a lot on the individual season box sets, which was probably due to them being on double-sided discs which is probably why Universal doesn't make their television DVD box sets with double-sided discs anymore and why they've only been making them on single-sided disks for the passed 3 years now.This was also the season when KITT gets a major upgrade and a major facelift with a new dashboard with more souped up new features that KITT didn't have in the first 2 seasons, including a lit up accelerator and features on the car that lit up more.The Third Season is also the Season is also when Bonnie Barstow(Patricia McPherson) comes back to the show as KITT's technician giving KITT a serious upgrade from the first 2 seasons, but they should've used the proper introduction to the ""Knight Of The Drones"" episode like they used on NBC, since ""Knight Of The Drones"" was the last episode where KITT had his old dashboard before Bonnie gave KITT his new upgraded dashboard after KITT gets blown up from a hasty accident that nearly destroyed KITT in the process, but I personally like the 3rd Season of KNIGHT RIDER the best out of it's whole 4-year run on NBC.This 1984-1985 Season is also the season when KITT's evil prototype KARR returns with a vengence in the ""KITT vs. KARR"" episode, except KARR is even more upgraded than he was in the ""Trust Doesn't Rust"" episode.In addition to the K.I.T.T. Vs. K.A.R.R. episode, I also noticed that they used the older Trans Ams with KITT's old dashboard to play KARR, since KARR never got a new dashboard, unlike KITT.Therefore, KARR wasn't as upgraded as KITT was in the KITT vs. KARR episode and had less features than KITT did, since KITT didn't have as many features in the first 2 seasons as he did in the 3rd Season.Therefore, in a way it was almost as if it was KITT with the new dashboard vs. KITT with the old dashboard, since they were showing KARR just like KITT was in the 2nd Season.This is also the season when the reclusive Michael(David Hasselhoff) and KITT battle cattle rustlers using monster trucks to help them do their dirty work, which made it a lot like a KITT vs. Big Foot episode, which was quite intriguing, since I always wondered to myself when I was little how it would be like if Knight Rider went up against the famous BIG FOOT monster truck.Unfortunately, this 1984-85 Season wasn't as strong as the first 2 seasons were especially since this show was obviously no longer in its honeymoon phase anymore since KNIGHT RIDER was starting to get overshadowed by the premiere of the short-lived STREET HAWK since it started giving viewers too much of the same thing every week back in the Winter of '85 since STREET HAWK & AIRWOLF were quite similar to KNIGHT RIDER which resulted in this show getting a slight decline in ratings in this season, especially since STREET HAWK had stole KITT's thunder along with the fact that Street Hawk & its rider(Jesse Mach)had stole ""The Man, The Machine"" motto away from Michael Knight & KITT when STREET HAWK made its debut on Friday January 4, 1985 since ABC had STREET HAWK on every Friday night, CBS had AIRWOLF every Saturday night, and NBC had KNIGHT RIDER every Sunday night which started getting viewers too much competition & redundancy every week since they were all too closely related to each other, especially since all 3 Universal TV shows premiered too soon after one another too since KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982, AIRWOLF had made its debut in the Winter of 1984, and STREET HAWK made its debut on ABC in the Winter of 1985, despite the fact that the creation and premiere of both STREET HAWK and AIRWOLF were inspired by the creation and premiere of KNIGHT RIDER since KITT was the first phenomenal futuristic autmobile in television history at the time.Therefore, without KNIGHT RIDER, there wouldn't have been any AIRWOLF or STREET HAWK.Unfortunately, STREET HAWK nearly killed this show & stole a lot of KNIGHT RIDERs viewers away basically beating KNIGHT RIDER to a pulp since STREET HAWK was more high-tech & more advanced with more upgraded features that outclassed the Knight 2000 big time K.O.ing KNIGHT RIDER in the ratings especially with STREET HAWKs hyperthrust speed feature that KITT didn't even have, despite the fact that KNIGHT RIDER lasted a lot longer than STREET HAWK did & even longer than AIRWOLF did, especially since STREET HAWK didn't even last a year despite the fact that STREET HAWK also ended up leading to the cancellation of KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF in the Summer of 1986 after STREET HAWK led to its own cancellation in the Spring of 1985 since STREET HAWK didn't get the ratings ABC wanted.Fortunately, KNIGHT RIDER stayed on the air and started another season in the Fall of 1985 while STREET HAWK was already long gone and axed, which made me glad since I always preferred KNIGHT RIDER to STREET HAWK anyways and I personally was never as fond of STREET HAWK in the first place either.Therefore, I was so happy when STREET HAWK was given the boot after only being on ABC for 3 1/2 months before it was cancelled permanently in June of 1985.In other words, STREET HAWK was a short-lived TV show that didn't even last, unlike KNIGHT RIDER and AIRWOLF, due to poor ratings, but the ratings on rival shows AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER were still going strong.It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Jared Martin in the ""Knight Of The Drones"" episode during his co-starring days on DALLAS*Alan Feinstein in the ""Knights Of The Fast Lane"" episode before his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL & SANTA BARBARA*Jeff Osterhage in the ""KITT Vs.

Chapman) on the ROCKFORD FILES & during his co-starring days on the soap operas DAYS OF OUR LIVES & ANOTHER WORLD*Bernard White in the ""Buy Out"" episode before his co-starring days as Sgt. Carl Molina on the short-lived police drama THE NEW DRAGNET*Richard Herd in the ""Knight Strike"" episode after his co-starring days as Hooker's hard-nosed superior officer(Capt. Dennis Sheridan) on the police drama TJ HOOKER*David Hedison in the ""Knight In Retreat"" episode after his co-starring days on VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEAI also liked the way Universal has provided a brief summary along with their original air-dates too.For instance, the original air-date to each of these 1984-1985 Season episodes was9/30/84-KNIGHT OF THE DRONES10/7/84-ICE BANDITS10/14/84-KNIGHTS OF THE FAST LANE10/28/84-HALLOWEEN KNIGHT11/4/84-KITT VS.

So way to go Universal. Hooray!By the way, Shout will be releasing the short-lived STREET HAWK with Rex Smith(Jesse Mach)out on DVD on Tuesday July 13th, 2010 for all you high-tech classic TV show fans out there.",4,"The
