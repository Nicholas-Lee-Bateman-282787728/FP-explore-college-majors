1029260,A2FBS0A33MWO9I,B000JU8H74,Jolar70,"[9, 13]","Like Japan's Sentai Ranger shows, Kamen (Masked) Rider has been living on in seemingly endless iterations since 1971. This film is supposed to be a retelling of the first series, or at least the origins of the characters who inhabited that show. The evil shadow-army Shocker, and the two rogue cyborgs they created who turn against them and become heroes and protectors of Japan. Like many modern retellings, both Western and Eastern, the designs are beautiful, especially the subtle and respectful updating of the Rider costumes, and even the monsters they fight, which were also classic combatants from the original show. Also respectful was the lack of CGI effects, which are appearing in increasing amounts in the more recent Rider TV shows like ""Kamen Rider Kiva"". In the early years, Kamen Rider was mostly a martial arts cyborg hero with a super-motorcycle and, to its credit, this movie honors the simple fun in that.What didn't work for me was the bland cast of pretty boys and girls (actually the boys are prettier) who seem to be pantomiming anime rather than acting as real humans. The original lead actor from the 70's, Hiroshi Fujioka, was certainly not naturalistic in his approach to the role of Takeshi Hongo either, but his dynamic presence was like watching a caged wild fire on screen. He was also very much an adult, as was his popular replacement, the always charismatic Hiroshi Miyauchi in the next series, Kamen Rider V3 from 1973. Speaking of Miyauchi, he has a tiny token cameo in this but it's so out of touch with the rest of the film that it just feels tacked on.The point is that, the once exciting, flesh and blood leads who helped create characters we cared about have been replaced with an even younger crowd of sullen hipsters, so skinny that they barely fill out their Rider costumes! Again, I think this is more of an anime influence. However, style alone isn't enough because, like so many re-makes, this one lacks the true heart and soul of the original. It's a little darker and pushes a few tragic love plots but, essentially, it's a very old story which has already been retold in most of the Kamen Rider series (as well as countless other Japanese super hero stories, both live action and anime). In order for this material to still have a life it needs to breathe with real actors and dialogue that matters. Otherwise, lets just watch the old shows because they were already so fun and great!",2,Another Good-Looking But Empty Remake...,1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,2435,"['Japan', 'Sentai', 'Ranger', 'Kamen', 'Masked', 'Rider', 'been', 'living', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'iterations', '1971', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'retelling', 'first', 'series', 'least', 'origins', 'characters', 'who', 'inhabited', 'show', 'evil', 'shadow-army', 'Shocker', 'two', 'rogue', 'cyborgs', 'created', 'who', 'turn', 'become', 'heroes', 'protectors', 'Japan', 'many', 'modern', 'retellings', 'Western', 'Eastern', 'designs', 'are', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'subtle', 'respectful', 'updating', 'Rider', 'costumes', 'even', 'monsters', 'fight', 'were', 'also', 'classic', 'combatants', 'original', 'show', 'Also', 'respectful', 'was', 'lack', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'appearing', 'increasing', 'amounts', 'more', 'recent', 'Rider', 'TV', 'shows', 'Kamen', 'Rider', 'Kiva', 'early', 'years', 'Kamen', 'Rider', 'was', 'mostly', 'martial', 'arts', 'cyborg', 'hero', 'super-motorcycle', 'credit', 'movie', 'simple', 'fun', 'that.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'bland', 'cast', 'pretty', 'boys', 'girls', 'actually', 'boys', 'are', 'prettier', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'pantomiming', 'anime', 'rather', 'acting', 'real', 'humans', 'original', 'lead', 'actor', '70', 'Hiroshi', 'Fujioka', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'naturalistic', 'approach', 'role', 'Takeshi', 'Hongo', 'dynamic', 'presence', 'was', 'watching', 'caged', 'wild', 'fire', 'screen', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'adult', 'was', 'popular', 'replacement', 'always', 'charismatic', 'Hiroshi', 'Miyauchi', 'next', 'series', 'Kamen', 'Rider', 'V3', '1973', 'Speaking', 'Miyauchi', 'tiny', 'token', 'cameo', 'so', 'touch', 'rest', 'film', 'just', 'feels', 'tacked', 'on.The', 'point', 'once', 'exciting', 'flesh', 'blood', 'leads', 'who', 'helped', 'create', 'characters', 'cared', 'about', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'even', 'younger', 'crowd', 'sullen', 'hipsters', 'so', 'skinny', 'barely', 'fill', 'out', 'Rider', 'costumes', 'Again', 'think', 'more', 'anime', 'influence', 'However', 'style', 'alone', ""n't"", 'enough', 'so', 'many', 're-makes', 'one', 'true', 'heart', 'soul', 'original', 'little', 'darker', 'few', 'tragic', 'love', 'plots', 'essentially', 'very', 'old', 'story', 'already', 'been', 'retold', 'most', 'Kamen', 'Rider', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'countless', 'other', 'Japanese', 'super', 'hero', 'stories', 'live', 'action', 'anime', 'order', 'material', 'still', 'have', 'life', 'breathe', 'real', 'actors', 'dialogue', 'matters', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'watch', 'old', 'shows', 'were', 'already', 'so', 'fun', 'great']",Masked Rider - The First
1029261,APGDB8X9AGCGO,B000JU8H74,Lin Yan,"[2, 9]","Some Americans who know or heard of Kamen Rider  may consider it as a plain copy from the ghost rider, dispite the fact that the orginal skull man created by Ishinomori Shtar came out in 1970, and the first Kamen Rider series was boradcast in 1971, when the Ghost Rider only made his first appearance in Marvel Spotlight in 1972, which was a year later after the first Kamen Rider show and 2 years later after the oringnal Skull Man, which was consider the inspriation of Kamen Rider.Which comes the fact that is really hard to say who was copying who. Therefore, I think this superhero do deserve a little more global respect than he has. When the first Kamen Rider show succeeded in making wellknown impact throughout the east Asain countries, but failed to impress the western auduiances, this franchise is nowdays still remain unknown to the most Amercians. When Toei decided to remake a Rider movie in its first ""laida kiku"" verision, I was supprised, but when it decided to issue DVDs in America, I was shocked.I have seen this movie a while agao when it first released on DVD in other contries. Quite frankly I was a little disapointed for its lacking of spirit and no depth of charcters; the special affect was not bad, but compare with the spider-man movies this was a little bit lame. Therefore, I don't think this movie is impressive enough to make an impact in America.

At least another half hour and the director of the movie, could have had the Shocker foot soldiers. First attack Masked Riders 1 and 2, with machine guns and have our 2 heroes. Either dodge the bullets or have them bounce off of their armor. Besides the way that their armor looks , it looks like it's bulletproof anyway right? If I was creating cyborg soldiers, for my own secret organization. They wouldn't just have to be strong, fast, and, agile. They would also have to have bulletproof, yet lightweight armor to protect themselves. As for the soundtrack  Bright our Future , that song was okay . But it would have been much better, if they have had Animetal's version. Of the Masked Rider theme playing, especially during the fight scenes. And of course more special effects especially when either, Masked Rider 1 or 2 does their legendary finishing move the Rider Kick. It would have been cool if they would had some kind of blazing energy. Surrounding whatever foot that they're, going to do the Rider Kick. With and also have them shout out Rider Kick , when they perform that move. Also I'm still wondering when Tokyo Shock is going to release Masked Rider the Next  here in America, cause they've  already should have released it here !!!!!!",4,RIDER KICK!!!!!!!,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,1384,"['liked', 'update', 'classic', '1971', 'tokusatsu', 'series', 'Masked', 'Rider', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'fight', 'scenes', 'least', 'half', 'hour', 'director', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'Shocker', 'foot', 'soldiers', 'First', 'attack', 'Masked', 'Riders', '1', '2', 'machine', 'guns', 'have', '2', 'heroes', 'dodge', 'bullets', 'have', 'bounce', 'armor', 'way', 'armor', 'bulletproof', 'anyway', 'right', 'was', 'creating', 'cyborg', 'soldiers', 'own', 'secret', 'organization', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'have', 'be', 'strong', 'fast', 'agile', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'have', 'bulletproof', 'yet', 'lightweight', 'armor', 'protect', 'soundtrack', 'Bright', 'Future', 'song', 'was', 'okay', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'have', 'had', 'Animetal', 'version', 'Masked', 'Rider', 'theme', 'playing', 'especially', 'fight', 'scenes', 'course', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'especially', 'when', 'Masked', 'Rider', '1', '2', 'legendary', 'finishing', 'move', 'Rider', 'Kick', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'would', 'had', 'kind', 'blazing', 'energy', 'Surrounding', 'foot', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'Rider', 'Kick', 'also', 'have', 'shout', 'out', 'Rider', 'Kick', 'when', 'perform', 'move', 'Also', ""'m"", 'still', 'wondering', 'when', 'Tokyo', 'Shock', 'going', 'release', 'Masked', 'Rider', 'Next', 'here', 'America', 'cause', ""'ve"", 'already', 'should', 'have', 'released', 'here']",Masked Rider - The First
