695335,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B000063JZR,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[1, 1]","""Tidy Time with Bear"" is another three-episode DVD of excellent episodes from ""Bear in the Big Blue House."" Although all of them touch on themes of cleaning, only ""Woodland House Wonderful"" really sticks very closely to that theme. Despite this, this is still a wonderful set. The three episodes are:""Working Like a Bear""This episode is all about work of various sorts. Bear goes to work berry-picking and sees how his friends in the Big Blue House are working. Sometimes, just playing and learning can be working --- ""Workin' Like a Kid!"" This episode includes the song ""Everybody in the Tub,"" which no doubt helped to land it on this DVD.""Woodland House Wonderful""This is the episode that most easily fits the theme. Everybody helps to clean up when the Big Blue House is chosen as a feature home for the magazine ""Woodland House Wonderful."" This episode includes the songs ""Clean up the House,"" ""Everybody in the Tub"" and ""Brush Brush Bree.""""We Did it Our Way""Finally, in this episode, Bear is at it again --- helping his friends to work together and have fun. He helps Pip and Pop to retrieve a jar lid, helps out with games and even gets some help himself with some cooking for Doc Hogg.This DVD has sing-alongs for the songs ""Everybody in the Tub,"" Brush Brush Bree,"" ""Clean Up the House"" and ""Get it Together."" The words appear in big, easy-to-follow lettering and while occasionally the lyrics are bit inaccurate on these sing-alongs, it's overall very-well-done.I can't speak to the improvements made to the newer of the DVD, as I watched older one. However, they sound great. Overall, I don't have anything bad to say about this release. It doesn't have any high-powered special features, but the show is so good that it doesn't really need to have any. Yet another neat release from the series.",5,Working Like a Bear,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1805,"['Tidy', 'Time', 'Bear', 'three-episode', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'Bear', 'Big', 'Blue', 'House', 'touch', 'themes', 'cleaning', 'only', 'Woodland', 'House', 'Wonderful', 'really', 'very', 'closely', 'theme', 'still', 'wonderful', 'set', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'Working', 'Bear', 'episode', 'work', 'various', 'sorts', 'Bear', 'work', 'berry-picking', 'how', 'friends', 'Big', 'Blue', 'House', 'are', 'working', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'playing', 'learning', 'can', 'be', 'working', 'Workin', 'Kid', 'episode', 'song', 'Everybody', 'Tub', 'doubt', 'helped', 'land', 'DVD', 'Woodland', 'House', 'Wonderful', 'episode', 'most', 'easily', 'theme', 'Everybody', 'clean', 'up', 'when', 'Big', 'Blue', 'House', 'chosen', 'feature', 'home', 'magazine', 'Woodland', 'House', 'Wonderful', 'episode', 'songs', 'Clean', 'up', 'House', 'Everybody', 'Tub', 'Brush', 'Brush', 'Bree', 'Did', 'Way', 'Finally', 'episode', 'Bear', 'again', 'helping', 'friends', 'work', 'together', 'have', 'fun', 'Pip', 'Pop', 'retrieve', 'jar', 'lid', 'out', 'games', 'even', 'help', 'cooking', 'Doc', 'Hogg.This', 'DVD', 'sing-alongs', 'songs', 'Everybody', 'Tub', 'Brush', 'Brush', 'Bree', 'Clean', 'Up', 'House', 'Get', 'Together', 'words', 'appear', 'big', 'easy-to-follow', 'lettering', 'occasionally', 'lyrics', 'are', 'bit', 'inaccurate', 'sing-alongs', 'overall', 'very-well-done.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'improvements', 'made', 'newer', 'DVD', 'watched', 'older', 'one', 'However', 'sound', 'great', 'Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'bad', 'say', 'release', ""n't"", 'have', 'high-powered', 'special', 'features', 'show', 'so', 'good', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'have', 'neat', 'release', 'series']",N/A
695336,A2LUJ7HIK09GEU,B000063JZR,H. Thomas,"[2, 2]","Great that this one comes in spanish too. We live in Colombia and my 1 year old daughter is watching this same Bear DVD several times each week since she has 6 months. She knows when the songs are coming and prepares herself for dancing with the bear and she learned to use the tooth-brush.When she's watching the bear it gives us some free time for cooking or cleaning because she is sitting still and watching for 15 or more minutes. A great wish is to have bear also in german, because she has to learn that. German and Spanish. I think finally she will speak english too if shes watching bear in english some times.",5,My daughters favorit,1043884800,"01 30, 2003",2003,619,"['Great', 'one', 'spanish', 'too', 'live', 'Colombia', '1', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'watching', 'same', 'Bear', 'DVD', 'several', 'times', 'week', '6', 'months', 'when', 'songs', 'are', 'coming', 'prepares', 'dancing', 'bear', 'learned', 'use', 'tooth-brush.When', 'watching', 'bear', 'free', 'time', 'cooking', 'cleaning', 'sitting', 'still', 'watching', '15', 'more', 'minutes', 'great', 'wish', 'have', 'bear', 'also', 'german', 'learn', 'German', 'Spanish', 'think', 'finally', 'will', 'speak', 'english', 'too', 'shes', 'watching', 'bear', 'english', 'times']",N/A

This has wonderful music as bear usually does and is alot of fun. Bear does it again teaching children to clean up while entertaining at the same time.

695338,A23AFVXWF9A0CF,B000063JZR,Sallie A. Neal,"[16, 16]","This is a great tape for any child that loves bear and/or has trouble with being tidy.This tape includes two back-to-back episodes of cleanliness.  The first one shows the day in the life of Bear, and his daily chores that he must do every day to keep harmony in the big blue house.  He explains many different kinds of work, and how working pays off.  In the second episode, Bear plans to take a day for himself when he receives a surprise phone call telling him that his house is the Woodland House Wonderful ""house of the month"". As thrilled as Bear is, he suddenly realizes that his day of rest is now becoming a day of cleaning.  Luckily his pals, Ojo, Pip,Pop,Tutter, and Treelo all agree to join him and clean up the house.  After all their hard work, come the baths and lunch, and they are so exhaused by the time Mrs. Vanderpreene comes to take the pictures that they don't think they'll have any fun.  But their time with her makes the whole effort worth while.I am using this tape right now with my two year old.  She was having problems with not picking up her toys.  Having this video for her to watch has improved her cleaning abilities greatly!  She loves Bear and all his colorful friends. The songs ""Rub-A-Dub-Dub Everybody In The Tub"", ""Brush-Brush-Bree"", and ""Clean Up The House"" keep my daughter moving and motivated.  As a parent I highly recommend this video for your child, it's a great way to teach them some values, but have fun at the same time!",5,Learn To Be Tidy With The Best Bear Around!,1025222400,"06 28, 2002",2002,1471,"['great', 'tape', 'child', 'bear', 'and/or', 'trouble', 'being', 'tidy.This', 'tape', 'two', 'back-to-back', 'episodes', 'cleanliness', 'first', 'one', 'day', 'life', 'Bear', 'daily', 'chores', 'must', 'do', 'day', 'keep', 'harmony', 'big', 'blue', 'house', 'many', 'different', 'kinds', 'work', 'how', 'working', 'pays', 'off', 'second', 'episode', 'Bear', 'take', 'day', 'when', 'surprise', 'phone', 'call', 'telling', 'house', 'Woodland', 'House', 'Wonderful', 'house', 'month', 'As', 'thrilled', 'Bear', 'suddenly', 'day', 'rest', 'now', 'becoming', 'day', 'cleaning', 'Luckily', 'pals', 'Ojo', 'Pip', 'Pop', 'Tutter', 'Treelo', 'agree', 'join', 'clean', 'up', 'house', 'hard', 'work', 'come', 'baths', 'lunch', 'are', 'so', 'exhaused', 'time', 'Mrs.', 'Vanderpreene', 'take', 'pictures', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'whole', 'effort', 'worth', 'while.I', 'am', 'using', 'tape', 'right', 'now', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'having', 'problems', 'not', 'picking', 'up', 'toys', 'Having', 'video', 'watch', 'improved', 'cleaning', 'abilities', 'greatly', 'Bear', 'colorful', 'friends', 'songs', 'Rub-A-Dub-Dub', 'Everybody', 'Tub', 'Brush-Brush-Bree', 'Clean', 'Up', 'House', 'keep', 'daughter', 'moving', 'motivated', 'parent', 'highly', 'recommend', 'video', 'child', 'great', 'way', 'teach', 'values', 'have', 'fun', 'same', 'time']",N/A
