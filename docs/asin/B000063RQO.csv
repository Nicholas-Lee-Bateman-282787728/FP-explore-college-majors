695755,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000063RQO,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 13]","How High is a film that lends nothing, I repeat, nothing to the film community at large.  I have read some critics that say that this film introduced a whole new generation to the Cheech & Chong of the new millennium with the Redman/Method Man pairing.  While most seem to agree that this is a horrible film, very few of them mention how utterly racist the overall experience happens to be.  When I use the word racist, I mean that it builds upon the degenerate clich&eacute;s that African Americans struggle with on a daily basis with our society.  While there were elements in this film that seemed like there was some reverse racism occurring, what struck me hardest in the face was how embarrassing Method Man and Redman must be to both the film community, but also to their own culture.  I have a very open mind when it comes to social issues as well as films, but this one left my jaw on the floor several times.  The blatant swings at African American stereotypes were meant to be a source of humor for director Jesse Dylan, but instead fell flat on their embarrassed face.  Humor was in very short supply in this film due to the ethnic stereotype clich&eacute;s that seemed to be used nearly every second of this film.  Nothing was original.  Nothing was exciting.Was the pairing of Redman and Method Man an idea of comedic proportions?  I think not.  As you can tell from their short lived series after the release of this film, the corporate world wanted to cash in on these two rappers, but soon realized that they were not as bankable as they thought.  Why?  Method Man and Redman, who completely different people, were nothing more than the same character in this film.  With the very subtle hints of Method Man being smarter, nothing could separate the equality of these two characters.  That is why they failed as a comic team.  Think of Matthau and Lemmon or the above example of Cheech & Chong, what made these teams work while the How High team crashed and burned?  What worked the best were the differences that uniquely drew the pair together.  Their differences made us laugh and sympathetically brought them together, but with Method Man and Redman, they were the same.  I was watching the same two characters fight through the same two challenges in this film. What tried to be funny instead transformed into repetitive.  What Dylan did to counter the similarity between Redman/Method Man was bring in obscure secondary characters that added nothing to the flimsy plot or helped us feel emotion for our two main characters.  The clich&eacute; jock, the clich&eacute; frat boy, the clich&eacute; Asian (which was again another racist moment), and the clich&eacute; rich white boy, just felt and were old.  Watch college films from the 70s and you will see these same combinations, but what makes the films from the 70s different is that they used them with originality.  How High, from beginning to end, was anything but original.I must admit, after watching this film of which Harvard was willing to loan their name to, I don't want to go to Harvard.  They should have pondered the effects this film would have upon their prestige heritage.  How High is a dark spot in Harvard's history.  Do you know what makes it even worse?  This film wasn't even created at or anywhere near Harvard.  Again, Dylan was cutting corners to create a false sense of realism that continued to hurt this film.  How High has no redeeming qualities.  Ooops, I stand corrected.  The only smile that was ever created on my face during this film was when Spalding Gray spoke.  How did they get him and Fred Willard to do this film?  I have said it once, I will say it again, some actors just need their bills paid.  Inconsistency, incompetence, and aggravation seemed to be the hidden themes of this dud.  What destroyed this film further is that if you take the actors away and look at the story in general, it is nothing.  There is no original story at all with How High.  Going to college, working for your grades, winning over the heart of the President right at the last minute - this was nothing short of a ""cut and paste"" film that had no backbone and horrid acting!I do not like Jesse Dylan's style of directing.  While I think Kicking and Screaming is his prized film (due greatly to Will Ferrell), all of his films seem to be extremely choppy with the editing and are randomly interjected with an overdose of unnecessary scenes.  The John Adams scene in How High is a prime example.  The Benjamin Franklin moments is another.  The unconcluded ""Truth Serum"" can be considered another.  How High was just scene after scene of inconsistency.  Lumpy oatmeal would win first place before this film would ever be congratulated!  I blame a majority of the issues with this film on Jesse Dylan.  If he would have tightened the script, created unique and ""cult-like"" characters, and eliminated the racism, he may have had the quintessential ""weed"" film in Hollywood.  Now, all he has is a violent case of the munchies and nothing to show for.  Sad.Overall, this was one of the worst films that I have witnessed.  Never have I been so emotionally charged about the racist moments in this film as I have with How High.  The actors, all around, were horrible.  The story had no legs to stand on and it became very obvious after the opening credits that unless you were either 10 to 15 years of age, this film would never be considered a comedy.  Nothing was funny.  Nothing will make you laugh.  The only part worth enjoying in this film is the ending credits.  The ending credits give you a chance to walk away and forget this part of your cinematic life.Grade: * out of *****",1,"I figure if I study high, take the test high, get high scores!

To admit that I actually wore my sweater like Method Man because of this movie turns my cheeks red.

After that, well it's rather generic teen/sex/com fun, and it mostly works.Mostly.Red Man and Method Man deliver respectable performances considering who they are and what they do (they are by far more superior rappers than actors) and the supporting cast is predictably sufficient for what they need to do.

695762,A3DDRVEBLLCAAW,B000063RQO,Brett Foster,"[8, 13]","I saw a review calling this a poor man's Cheech and Chong, and I have to aggree for the most part.  Fans will appreciate the soundtrack, but in the comedy realm, How High certainly doesn't stack up to its collegiate comedy peers like Road Trip and American Pie 2.Let me compare it to something similar.  Half-Baked was not a good movie.  It did have Dave Chappelle, though, and it had some pretty funny parts.  It was probably worth the price of admission just to see the Sampson music video.  Anyway, Half-Baked was a movie about a pothead who gets the girl in the end.  It was a low-budget movie with mediocre production, but it had funny parts and an actual storyline.  How High is also a movie about a pothead who gets the girl in the end.  It had a decent budget and some legitimate names producing it, but that couldn't save a story where every element of plot and humor was either laboriously contrived or else predictable enough to see coming ten minutes ahead.  The most interesting part of How High is the cinematography and camera angles, if you overlook the fact that the actual location they were filming wasn't anywhere near Harvard.  Suspension of disbelief only goes so far, though, and it seems extremely odd that this movie obviously doesn't take place in New England and that there is a hot black girl (Essence Atkins) with an attitude strutting around campus with the Secret Service because she's supposed to be the Vice President's daughter.By the time you're five minutes into How High, you've got the idea that every white guy is an imbecile and every black guy is an urban Einstein.  The crackhead in the opening scene is a white hippie.  The Black History professior is a [not very bright] cracker.  The main girl's obnoxious jerk of a white boyfriend Bart might as well just be referred to as ""The Man.""  It's not particularly offensive, it just makes things even more predictable when the whitest good-guy in the film is played by Hector Elizondo, a Spanish guy from Harlem.The part that keeps you guessing is trying to figure out just who the main characters are.  Is Redman supposed to be a main character?  He certainly doesn't contribute to the plot.  He is just interjected into the storyline when Method Man sees him in a parking lot and they decide to smoke up in his car.  Is Method Man supposed to be a genius?  He seems to know everything, and takes a break from his gangsta slang to correct white people on their grammar, but if he's so smart, why did he have to cheat to get into Harvard, and why does he have to cheat on every test he takes once there?The main character is a drug dealer.  Method Man and Redman meet in a car billowing with pot smoke.  They need weed to wake up.  They need weed before tests.It gets better near the end, and there are actually some funny parts.  You get to see them dig up the body of John Quincy Adams and drag it to their dorm to grind up in a blender and smoke.  Lauren discovers the world's first bong invented by Ben Franklin.  The movie closes with Lauren telling her boyfriend that he never satisfied her, then Method Man looks at the camera and says, ""But I can.""

695765,A3V5YEY65T37UL,B000063RQO,David Butler,"[4, 17]","I saw this film for the first time last night.  Two of my friends insisted it was very funny and I needed to see it, so I did.  The beginning of the movie showed promise, and I expected it to be something in the vein of Half-Baked.  It wasn't.  Except for a couple laughable moments, How High is nothing but an incredibly racist piece of trash.  I am white and found the movie endlessly offensive.  I'm disappointed that my friends (also white) enjoyed it at all.There is no question that many films have been made that disparage black people and I in no way approve of that, but two wrongs do not make a right.  Every white character in this movie was either a racist jerk or a complete moron.  I'm so tired of seeing these films that treat all Caucasions like wimpy, thoughtless idiots, sending a message of black superiority.  Everybody just needs to stop this kind of nonsense.  It's fine to have a racist character in order to make a point, but this story had absolutely no heart and was utterly dispicable!I remember hip-hop culture becoming trendy when I was in my early teens.  Everyone started wearing the baggy clothes and talking like an ignorant gangsta.  I even did it for a while, but soon got over it.  The people who act this way need to grow up.  Life is too short and important to waste being fake.  So many black folks seem to detest other black folks who speak clearly, are educated, and successful.  They say that these people have compromised their own culture and are ""acting white.""  What?!  You cannot act like a different race!  I have all the respect in the world for anyone who wants to make something of themselves and doesn't resign themselves to drugs and violence.  Also, know that blacks who are proper and respectable HATE blacks who embrace the stereotype of lazy pot-smoking loserdom.You may think I am taking this movie too seriously since it was intended as a comedy, but I don't think so.  My purpose in writing this review is to say that racism of any kind is not funny.

695779,A28ZRCOKQOA4QX,B000063RQO,John Heard,"[2, 4]","This college professor lives right around the corner from me.  One day we were talking about movies and I told him about one of my favorite guilty pleasures, How High.I told him it was about this guy who sprinkles his dead friend's ashes into a growing marijuana plant, and when he smokes the plant he can see and speak with ghosts that help him cheat on the SAT and get into Harvard.  Then I told him Spalding Grey was in it.  My professor friend was like, ""wait, what's this movie called again?""  I guess there's a little something here for everybody who enjoys the absurd.Spalding Gray really did have one of the funniest cameos I've ever seen.  Another thing I liked about this comedy was the way our heroes Jamal and Silas help those around them.  When they first meet their roommates I was all, ""no way these guys are going to get along,"" but then they pull it off.  Actually, Jamal and Silas save all of their friends.  Instead of trying to be what they think they're supposed to be, their friends become who they really want to be.So why laugh with How High?  It's all of the seemingly random, silly little details they put in there.  Those really get me every time.  The pork chops-a-chunky commercial.  The dialogue between the pimp and the assistant pimp.  Redman thinking that maybe he's a ghost and trying to walk through pedestrians.  Everything that I Need Money does in the background.  Everything Justin Urich says is actually pretty funny.  Actually it's all pretty funny.  Watch the deleted scenes on the DVD.  I remember there being some dream sequence that takes place inside I Need Money's gold tooth, and that was really funny.If you like a little of the absurd in your comedy, then you may enjoy this flick.Just keep in mind that the story is about succeeding on your own terms, getting what you want and having some laughs along the way.  The story isn't so much about a realistic portrayal of how different socioeconomic and ethnic groups relate on a college campus.

695798,ABE14SVILZLNY,B000063RQO,"SID ""Punk""","[1, 2]","""How High"" generates considerable hilarity when it turns loose rappers Method Man and Redman on an unsuspecting Harvard University.The way they get there is pretty funny in this raunchy, good-natured comedy from Universal. Written by Dustin Lee Abraham and directed by Jesse Dylan, it features a fine mix of several generations of comic talent plus a terrific soundtrack from its stars. It blends tracks old and new and features cuts from and pairings with other hip-hop artists, which are in turn incorporated into Rockwilder's lively score.Method Man's Silas is content to make his living as the medicine man of his Staten Island neighborhood with his herbal brews, caring for his elderly father and spending his money on hookers. He pays no attention to his best friend Ivory (Chuck Davis) urging him to try for medical school until Ivory meets with a freaky fatal accident. To honor his friend's memory, Silas plants some seeds with Ivory's cremated remains, which yield a lush plant with outsized buds. He dutifully decides to submit to a college entrance exam as well.Meanwhile, over in New Jersey, Redman's Jamal, after six years of goofing off in junior college, is at last expelled. Jamal's fed-up mother (Anna Maria Horsford, in a gem of a comic turn) points to the pictures of her older son and daughter on her living room wall and reminds him that at least his brother earned a certificate as a trained barber in prison, where he's still doing time, and his sister holds a diploma in weaving hair.""Six years in junior college was not what I had in mind for you,"" she says irately. The prospect of being thrown out propels him to the testing center, where he meets Jamal and shares some smokes derived from those ""Ivory"" buds, only to have the white-suited Ivory emerge from the haze, promising to supply the answers to the exam they have scant hope of passing. (The aura of old Cheech and Chong pothead movies is as strong as a contact high.) Perfect scores zoom the new friends to Harvard, purportedly lacking in multicultural diversity, where Ivory continues to materialize to help out on tests.Chasing girls and having fun are Silas and Jamal's top priorities, and as broad as this comedy gets, there's a satirical edge in the clash between the duo's brash style and academic pomposity. They immediately run afoul of the dean (Obba Babatunde), a smug figure of propriety. The casting of the actress who plays the dean's wife--Melissa Peterman, as good a sport as Babatunde--is surely intended to bring to mind an image of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife, so similar-looking are the two couples. The dean makes it clear that, in his view, Silas and Jamal are disreputable types he intends to send back to the ghetto--that's his word, and he utters it with undisguised disdain.Meanwhile, Silas is taken with Lauren (Lark Voorhies), with whom he shares a class in botany, while Jamal is bowled over by Jamie (Essence Atkins), the daughter of the vice president (Jeffrey Jones), not of Harvard, but of the United States of America. Silas and Jamal's search for a good time culminates in a wild Halloween dorm party complete with pimps and hookers.But what's to happen to them when they run out of those special ""Ivory"" buds? Could it be that they would have to buckle down and study? ""How High"" is careful to make it perfectly clear that, like students of every possible background, they have what it takes if only they apply themselves.The Harvard University of this film is so much a fantasy that it matters not at all that UCLA is standing in for it; the difference in architecture and age of the two institutions is so radical that even the color of the bricks of their buildings differs in hue. ""How High"" is not really about college life, other than its nearly subliminal nudge about the value of higher learning.Although ""How High"" begins to run out of inspiration before it's over, it manages to take some jabs at the hypocrisy and condescension of the snobby academic and social ruling classes and, in turn, at whites who feel compelled to assume blacker-than-black attitudes in communicating with African Americans instead of simply being themselves.There's a spirit of generosity to ""How High"" that allows many performers to shine beyond its sharp and amiable stars. They range from such veterans as Spalding Gray, Hector Elizondo, Tracey Walter and Fred Willard to younger comedians like Davis (who's so sly it's a good thing that his Ivory returns as a ghost), Chris Elwood, Dennison Samaroo, Al Shearer, T.J. Thyne, Justin Urich, Trieu Tran and, above all, Mike Epps as the endlessly comical pimp Baby Powder and Scruncho as his put-upon assistant, Baby Wipe.That what is often described euphemistically as an ""urban"" comedy such as ""How High"" should turn up amid a clutch of prestigious year-end Oscar contenders is downright subversive--and pleasingly so.",5,HoW HiGh,1032825600,"09 24,
