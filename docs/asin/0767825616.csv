18187,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,0767825616,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[14, 28]","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is the 1967 Sidney Poitier film about interracial marriage that made the AFI Top 100 list.  So why the mediocre rating by this reviewer and many others?  I mean we have the great Sidney Poitier, as well as Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.  We have the decent director Stanley Kramer (who did On the Beach), we have the great era of the 1960s and we have a controversial theme.  Well the key to the mediocrity lies in a very weak script by William Rose that doesn't ring true in many ways.John Prentice (Poitier) wants to marry Joey Drayton (Katharine Houghton) and all hell breaks loose between the parents (Tracy, Hepburn, Beah Richards, and Roy Glenn).  Problem is the script tries to be politically correct while ignoring any semblance of reality or non-nerdness (to coin a word).For example:  a 2-faced employee wishes the couple well with whispering asides to Hepburn (in a WAY over the top cartoonish manner for both the well wishes and the asides). Joey says ""Mom, she was well, RUDE!""  actually she wasn't rude at all, she was 2-faced...big difference lost on the writer.  And to get the lady out of their collective hair Hepburn gives her $5000.00.  Not much of a punishment for being 2-faced.Then we get this wacky priest who drinks, sings ""We can Work it Out"" in the most pretentiously hip unhip touch of the film, and thinks its funny that Mr. Liberal (Tracy) has such a problem with the marriage.  As far as Poitier's speech to his father, ""You think of yourself as a black man, I think of myself as a man"", I have this to say:  I'm sure men have thought that, but I doubt they ever said it, i.e. it came out of the writer, not out of reality.  And I have no idea why they left that scene in where Tracy rams a black guy's car and the guy yells ""There oughta be a law!""  It didn't make sense, it didn't fit into the film, and I suppose it was just an ill-concieved joke by the writer.And Tracy's speech at the end is supposed to be so touching, and it reduces Hepburn to tears...but really it's big on schmaltz and low on substance.  This film is TV movie quality and made it into the AFI Top 100; hey AFI, ever hear of this other Poitier film from 1967...a little film called In the Heat of the Night?  Such is my BIG GRIPE.  How could this film make it while one of the best films of the decade doesn't?  Answer:  Politics.  This one was about subtle middle class racism, that one was about blatant Southern racism.  Well all I can say is see both films and YOU decide.",2,AFI Top 100?

18194,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767825616,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 9]","Understand that I understand that this movie probably had a much deeper impact upon its release, and that my review may actually be harsher that it would be had I actually seen it in 1967 and not 2008, but also please understand that regardless of when a film was released, it is open to judgment based on its `aging' factor.  That said; I don't think `Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' holds up.The film tells the story of John Wade and Joey Drayton, an interracial couple who met in Hawaii.  Joey belongs to an upper-class White family; her parents being liberalists.  John came from simpler means, but he built a good profession for himself as a doctor and is well respected and admired.  The only problem is he's Black.  The couple has only known each other for a few days but they are in love and want to be married.  They travel to meet Joey's parents and tell them the good news.  Joey is nave and convinced that their racial difference will not be an issue, but John knows the reality of these things.  It's not that her parents would be apposed because of his skin color, but more or less because of the issues that their marriage would cause them in the long run.  They are more concerned for their daughter's reputation and well-being.Like John suspected, there are some issues and concerns and John makes it clear to the parents that if there are any problems he would not marry their daughter.  The only stipulation is that they make up their minds practically on the spot for he is only staying for dinner and then must catch a flight.And then his parents, who are equally apposed, join the party.The plot is rather ridiculous when you think about it.  No, not the fact that there are racial tensions and concerns because that can happen even today; but the way that the issue is presented is particularly ridiculous for the time in which it was released.  In the 60's interracial marriages were still taboo and so no daughter in her right mind would be stupid enough to expect her parents be okay with it so quickly.  She may be convinced that with time her parents would come around to the idea and even support her but she would never expect them to come to that conclusion immediately.  That is, unless she really was very stupid, and if that were the case then someone as smart as John would not be interested in marrying her.  I also found the reaction of John's mother, and even Joey's mother, to be rather over-the-top.  When Mrs. Prentice goes into this long speech about how Joey's father Matthew must not remember what it's like to love someone as deeply as John and Joey love one another, well, I wanted to laugh.  She was missing the point and came off as stupid as Joey.The fact remains that this movie is less about racism (because no one in this film is racist) and more about social conditioning.  The concerns raised by the parents (fathers mostly) is not anything out of racial spite but out of concern for the acceptance of others.  They want what is best for their children and would not want to see them suffer in any way.  I think that the way the script was written, well, it pulled away from the importance of the real issue.No one should tell you who to love and who to marry; that is true.The performances for the most part help to elevate this film.  I say `for the most part' because some of the performances, even the praised ones, come off rather ridiculous to me.First off; the good.Spencer Tracy (in his last screen performance) actually delivers a very well thought out and fleshed out performance as Matthew Drayton.  He captures the mans real concerns and expresses them rather well, especially in his overwritten ending monologue (the script was messy, but he worked with it).  Isabel Sanford (from `The Jeffersons') is also delightful here as the feisty maid Tillie.  I loved the fire she brought to her performance, and that attack on John is one of those scenes that just takes you by surprise.  Katherine Hepburn won the Oscar for this performance, and while I would never have given it to her (I don't think I would have even nominated her) I can say that she doesn't disappoint.  She is a tad scary here (I don't know what it is) but she manages to evoke some pure emotions.  Cecil Kellaway gives my favorite performance in the bunch though, and probably the only one I would have nominated.  As Monsignor Ryan he is charming and witty and entertaining and he also grasps his characters real motives and feelings on the matter.But then there is the bad.I enjoyed the first half of Poitier's performance for he had this natural charm I hadn't seen from him before (I am one of the few who finds him rather stiff) but as the film progressed and he went on the ridiculous rant about being oppressed by his fathers generation I began to be annoyed by his performance.  It may have more to do with the script, but then again, Tracy rose above the scrip; Poitier could not.  Katharine Houghton is also quite terrible, but then again, her character is an idiot so maybe that had to do with it.  Beah Richards received an Oscar nomination for her performance; why I'll never know.  Her only speaking lines came with that ridiculous speech to Matthew and I found that to be one of my least favorite scenes in the whole film.I don't have much to say about Roy Glenn.  He wasn't very memorable.In the end I give the film a C-.  I know that everyone loves this movie, but I just don't see what all the hype is about.  The script borders on comical it is so off and the acting is spotty.  The overall impact I know was heavy when it was released, but it has not aged well at all.  Kellaway and Tracy elevate this movie a lot for me, for they really got it.  I know that it tackles some major issues, but it could have went about it a better way.",3,Guess who's not really that impressed...,1225411200,"10 31, 2008",2008,5785,"['understand', 'movie',

18197,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,0767825616,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[1, 3]","Stanley Kramer's ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", while daring in theory (tackling interracial relationships, in 1967), played it far too 'safe', treating the issue so unrealistically that neither the black nor white communities of that time considered it as all that groundbreaking. But as an opportunity to see Sidney Poitier at the peak of his career, and experience the magic of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn a final time, the film can't be beat!Film historians have long dismissed the social 'relevance' of the production, accurately pointing out that Poitier's character, a brilliant, wealthy young black doctor serving the U.N., was designed to be so completely unthreatening and saintly that any chance to address real issues is lost; the same can be said of Tracy's character, a wealthy, liberal white newspaper publisher who had spent his life championing civil rights. These stereotypical characters cost the film any sense of credibility, and the passionless portrayal of the romance between Poitier and Katharine Houghton (they only kiss once, viewed through a taxi driver's rearview mirror), with only her childish giggling and posturing to indicate the depth of their relationship, doesn't help, either (one wonders why he would even be attracted to this silly child!). The story hinges on Poitier's demand that without Tracy and Hepburn's unequivocal approval, he will 'walk away', and this, too, is unrealistic, designed solely to provide a platform for Tracy's climactic answer, one of the most moving speeches of his long career, and the best moment of the film. While Stanley Kramer will be remembered as a daring producer/director who tackled important social issues head-on, ""Guess Who's Coming..."" is, at best, a very tentative first step.But as a showcase for three remarkable actors, this is an indispensable document. Tracy was so ill, during production (dying just 17 days after the film 'wrapped'), that he was uninsurable, with Kramer and Hepburn forced to promise to cover any losses, had he passed away before the film's completion. He was deeply touched by the gesture, and summoned up his remaining energy to give his performance the dynamic, yet thoughtful quality that characterized his best work (he would receive a posthumous Oscar nomination for the film). Poitier is almost as good, in a less challenging role, making his nearly superhuman character both accessible and sympathetic. Hepburn's role is much smaller, more in support than as a leading lady, and her 'Best Actress' Oscar was, honestly, undeserved (she would acknowledge it for what it really was; an Academy recognition of her and Tracy, both for this film and their other co-starring appearances, over 26 years). Her niece, Katharine Houghton, in her film debut as Poitier's fiance, is, honestly, little more than pretty window dressing.For the film's 40th anniversary, an additional DVD of Special Features has been added, including a 'Making Of' feature with insights by contemporary filmmakers and surviving members of the original cast, and featuring a lovely look at the very special relationship of Tracy and Hepburn, the funny acceptance speech for the Irving Thalberg Award by Stanley Kramer, and more.While ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" is flawed as a social document, as cinema it is well worth owning!",4,"Not As Daring As You'd Think, and Wonderful Performances!",1253404800,"09 20, 2009",2009,3321,"['Stanley', 'Kramer', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'daring', 'theory', 'tackling', 'interracial', 'relationships', '1967', 'played', 'far', 'too', ""'safe"", 'treating', 'issue', 'so', 'unrealistically', 'black', 'white', 'communities', 'time', 'considered', 'groundbreaking', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'peak', 'career', 'experience', 'magic', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'final', 'time', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', 'Film', 'historians', 'have', 'long', 'dismissed', 'social', ""'relevance"", 'production', 'accurately', 'pointing', 'out', 'Poitier', 'character', 'brilliant', 'wealthy', 'young', 'black', 'doctor', 'serving', 'U.N.', 'was', 'designed', 'be', 'so', 'completely', 'unthreatening', 'saintly', 'chance', 'address', 'real', 'issues', 'lost', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Tracy', 'character', 'wealthy', 'liberal', 'white', 'newspaper', 'publisher', 'who', 'had', 'spent', 'life', 'championing', 'civil', 'rights', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'cost', 'film', 'sense', 'credibility', 'passionless', 'portrayal', 'romance', 'Poitier', 'Katharine', 'Houghton', 'only', 'kiss', 'once', 'viewed', 'taxi', 'driver', 'rearview', 'mirror', 'only', 'childish', 'giggling', 'posturing', 'indicate', 'depth', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'help', 'one', 'why', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'attracted', 'silly', 'child', 'story', 'hinges', 'Poitier', 'demand', 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'unequivocal', 'approval', 'will', ""'walk"", 'away', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'designed', 'solely', 'provide', 'platform', 'Tracy', 'climactic', 'answer', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'speeches', 'long', 'career', 'best', 'moment', 'film', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'daring', 'producer/director', 'who', 'tackled', 'important', 'social', 'issues', 'head-on', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'best', 'very', 'tentative', 'first', 'step.But', 'showcase', 'three', 'remarkable', 'actors', 'indispensable', 'document', 'Tracy', 'was', 'so', 'ill', 'production', 'dying', 'just', '17', 'days', 'film', ""'wrapped"", 'was', 'uninsurable', 'Kramer', 'Hepburn', 'forced', 'promise', 'cover', 'losses', 'had', 'passed', 'away', 'film', 'completion', 'was', 'deeply', 'touched', 'gesture', 'summoned', 'up', 'remaining', 'energy', 'give', 'performance', 'dynamic', 'yet', 'thoughtful', 'quality', 'characterized', 'best', 'work', 'would', 'receive', 'posthumous', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'Poitier', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'less', 'challenging', 'role', 'making', 'nearly', 'superhuman', 'character', 'accessible', 'sympathetic', 'Hepburn', 'role', 'much', 'smaller', 'more', 'support', 'leading', 'lady', ""'Best"", 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'was', 'honestly', 'undeserved', 'would', 'acknowledge', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'Academy', 'recognition', 'Tracy', 'film', 'other', 'co-starring', 'appearances', '26', 'years', 'niece', 'Katharine', 'Houghton', 'film', 'debut', 'Poitier', 'fiance', 'honestly', 'little', 'more', 'pretty', 'window', 'dressing.For', 'film', '40th', 'anniversary', 'additional', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Features', 'been', 'added', 'including', ""'Making"", 'feature', 'insights', 'contemporary', 'filmmakers', 'surviving', 'members', 'original', 'cast', 'featuring', 'lovely', 'look', 'very', 'special', 'relationship', 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'funny', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'Award', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'flawed', 'social', 'document', 'cinema', 'well', 'worth', 'owning']",N/A

18200,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,0767825616,California Dreaming,"[0, 3]","I turned on the TV, and saw that ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" (JAN) was on.  Since I just saw the film ""Hannah Arendt"" -- a very fine film that I highly recommend -- I thought that I'd watch part of JAN, and if it looked good, find a later recording and watch it in its entirety.  Well, it only took about two minutes for me to realize that JAN is just another overblown performance by Spencer Tracy.What was it with Mr. Tracy, anyways?  Well, maybe it really wasn't him per se, but rather the writers who wrote long-winded-blow-hard dialog for him.  Right towards the end, he plays a judge at the trials (presumably since I didn't see much) and he once again comes across as a Bill O'Reilly type:  one that has, or at least thinks he has, moral superiority over everyone.  In other words:  no different from Mr. Tracy's performance in ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"" (GWCTD)Now, I lived in San Francisco for nearly two years, and for me, that city has its serious pluses and minuses.  I really liked the cinematography in this film, especially seeing the ""City by the Bay"" in a surely better era than today.  And I thought that Sidney Poitier does a very nice job in this film, and even the female characters aren't completely grating.  At least most of the time.But the speech at the end by Mr. Tracy?  Really?  Could you write a more pandering speech in the history of cinema?  Supposedly, he played a ""liberal"" from that era, which means that he was surely more conservative than Chris Christie will ever be today.  (BTW Mr. Christie:  go find yourself a short bridge and take yourself a very long walk.)  So of course this means that Mr. Tracy's character was mixed on his belief system; what he said and what he believed had a serious collision.  But his speech at the end here derails this film, a film that surely could have been great; I know that many people even today think that it is.  I wouldn't be one of those people, obviously.What if, for example, instead of being a doctor, Mr. Poitier was a dishwasher?  Would Mr. Tracy STILL have given that oh-so-eloquent speech at the end?  I think not.  In that case, Mr. Tracy would have kicked Mr. Poitier out of the house immediately, on Mr. Poitier's posterior.  This film didn't come down to really race relations, but rather economic relations.  I believe therefore that the screenplay undermines this film's position, and not just through lame speeches.So Guess Who's Panning the Pandering here?  Yes, I am.

For the films time, it did so as honestly as possible.  In the film Spencer Tracy says something to the measure of, ""Perhaps in 50 years, or a hundred this won't matter"".  I'm sad to report that 40+ years later bigotry is still alive and well and interracial marriages still are frowned upon by entirely too many.  And as the film illustrates, it can come from the most unexpected sources.  Hepburn and Tracy do a fabulous job in this, as usual.  I must also give kudos to Sidney Poitier and Isabel Sanford's performances as well as all of the cast members.  The most that even the staunchest bigot could object to, apart from the subject matter, is a chaste cheek peck.  There is nothing we see that should offend most parents or cause them concern.  It is the story of a couple who meet in Hawaii and unexpectedly fall in love deciding to marry.  The entire thing must be done quickly as the Doctor (Poitier) is going away for ten years to work for WHO and his bride to be is going to join him and marry abroad.  This is a wonderful film I cannot recommend highly enough.  Sadly, not all features are subtitled for the hearing impaired.

While this film caused quite a stir in 1967, watching it today is painful and cringe inducing.  It's strictly a product of its time.The story of an interracial couple (Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton) marrying was very radical in 1967, but today it's much more accepted.  Things are certainly not perfect, but they are much more tolerant than they were 40 years ago.  It is important to note that this film wasn't done for cheap shock value.  Stanley Kramer, the director and producer of the film, was a filmmaker who made socially conscious works throughout most of his career, so a film like this was a natural choice for him.  Unfortunately, the film is so dated and so obvious that it'll make modern audiences cringe.  The screenplay (which won an Oscar!) is trite and never goes beyond a sitcom level.  The film plays almost like a ""very special"" episode of a sitcom.  It takes a worthy subject and makes it as inoffensive as oatmeal.  It's so blanded down.  It's mawkish and overly sentimental as well, which makes it even worse.It's interesting to contrast this film with a film Poitier made the same year, and that's To Sir, With Love.  He plays an American teaching in a tough East End London school.  That film, while a bit corny at times, hasn't dated nearly as much as this one, mainly because Poitier's race is only mentioned once, and just for a few seconds (there's a scene where he cut himself, and one of his students foolishly says ""oh, he bleeds red"").  To Sir, With Love never telegraphs its punches like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner does.Many of Kramer's films have dated.  The films of Otto Preminger, another filmmaker who made socially conscious films, haven't dated at all and are still quite potent in their depiction of politics (his brilliant Advise and Consent), the Israeli/Palestinian conflict (Exodus), and drug addiction (The Man with the Golden Arm).  Preminger's work never resorted to maudlin sentimentality (something screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who wrote Exodus, admired about Otto), and as a result his work is still valid today.  While I admire Kramer's sincerity and choice of subject matter, I can't recommend this film.  A shame, as it has 3 of the greatest actors to grace the silver screen, and it's Spencer Tracy's last film.  All 3 of them are excellent, doing their best to make this pap watchable.  It's a pity the film isn't better.",2,"Mawkish, terribly dated, and borderline embarrassing....",1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,2522,"['problem', 'message', 'movies', 'such', 'tread', 'fine', 'line', 'being', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'being', 'universal', 'film', 'caused', 'quite', 'stir', '1967', 'watching', 'today', 'painful', 'cringe', 'inducing', 'strictly', 'product', 'time.The', 'story', 'interracial', 'couple', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Katherine', 'Houghton', 'marrying', 'was', 'very', 'radical', '1967', 'today', 'much', 'more', 'accepted', 'Things', 'are', 'certainly', 'not', 'perfect', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'tolerant', 'were', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'important', 'note', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'cheap', 'shock', 'value', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'director', 'producer', 'film', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'made', 'socially', 'conscious', 'works', 'most', 'career', 'film', 'was', 'natural', 'choice', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'so', 'dated', 'so', 'obvious', ""'ll"", 'make', 'modern', 'audiences', 'cringe', 'screenplay', 'won', 'Oscar', 'trite', 'never', 'sitcom', 'level', 'film', 'almost', 'very', 'special', 'episode', 'sitcom', 'worthy', 'subject', 'as', 'inoffensive', 'oatmeal', 'so', 'blanded', 'down', 'mawkish', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'worse.It', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'film', 'film', 'Poitier', 'made', 'same', 'year', 'Sir', 'Love', 'American', 'teaching', 'tough', 'East', 'End', 'London', 'school', 'film', 'bit', 'corny', 'times', ""n't"", 'dated', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'mainly', 'Poitier', 'race', 'only', 'mentioned', 'once', 'just', 'few', 'seconds', 'scene', 'where', 'cut', 'one', 'students', 'foolishly', 'oh', 'red', 'Sir', 'Love', 'never', 'telegraphs', 'punches', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'does.Many', 'Kramer', 'films', 'have', 'dated', 'films', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'made', 'socially', 'conscious', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'dated', 'are', 'still', 'quite', 'potent', 'depiction', 'politics', 'brilliant', 'Advise', 'Consent', 'Israeli/Palestinian', 'conflict', 'Exodus', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Man', 'Golden', 'Arm', 'Preminger', 'work', 'never', 'resorted', 'maudlin', 'sentimentality', 'something', 'screenwriter', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'who', 'wrote', 'Exodus', 'admired', 'Otto', 'result', 'work', 'still', 'valid', 'today', 'admire', 'Kramer', 'sincerity', 'choice', 'subject', 'matter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'shame', '3', 'greatest', 'actors', 'grace', 'silver', 'screen', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'last', 'film', '3', 'are', 'excellent', 'doing', 'best', 'make', 'pap', 'watchable', 'pity', 'film', ""n't"", 'better']",N/A

18220,A9I40WFF40R4,0767825616,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[1, 2]","In this 1967 film directed by Stanley Kramer at one point Spencer Tracy (Matthew Drayton) asks Sidney Poitier (John Prentice, M.D.) what will become of their children if he marries their daughter Katharine Drayton (Joanna). He responds that Joanna believes they will become president but he would settle for secretary of state. Her prophecy has already come true in part since the United States has now had two secretarys of state who are African American and a black man now all but has the Democratic nomination for president sewn up. The film is dated and wouldn't make much sense if set in the present. In 1967, however, a movie about an interracial marriage was certainly one that raised eyebrows.The rather thin plot is saved by the acting of three Academy Award winners, Tracey, Poitier and Hepburn-- she received a best actress award for her performance here-- all of whom give brilliant performances. Although I saw the film in 1967 I still remembered after all these years Tracy's speech near the end of the movie when he informs Poitier that, yes, he does remember what it was like to be madly in love at a young age. Of course the speech is even more poignant in retrospect since this was the last film Hepburn and Tracy ever made together for he died a few days after the film was completed. So when Hepburn's eyes teared up during his comments, we suspect that she wasn't acting at all.It was not unusual in the 1960's-- or even today for that matter-- for liberals not to always practice what they preached. Tracy plays a newspaper editor in San Francisco known and respected for his liberal views about race. It's the old ""not my daughter"" or ""not in my back yard"" syndrome.Occasionally the film relies on stereotypes-- Tillie, the cook and housekeeper-- for instance; and while it is not Mr. Kramer's best movie, it is certainly worth seeing again.

The film is hence historical about racial culture in America and it reflects a very particular period of the history of this country, of its conscisouness of the need to change inside for many and varied reasons. The film hence shows, without any concession, the resistance of both white and black parents to such a union, set mind you in the upper white middle class and the lower black middle class. The arguments are all different, but the two mothers seem to be shown more positively, more open to change, readier to accept the crazy decision of love, this little capricious angel and god that wants to have nothing to do with the unbearable social limitations of our world. So, in a way, the mothers are more positive in this situation than the fathers and these are shown as resisting harder. We must also note that the future husband is the black side of the marriage and the future wife the white side of it. This makes things both simple and complex. Very complex for the white family because a daughter must be given away in marriage and this time this  given away  takes its full meaning, at least in a bigot's consciousness. But it also makes things very simple in a way by more or less endorsing the traditional sexual attraction of black men for white women and white women for black men. For the bigots it may be nothing but sex and not love, lust and not moral sense or moral feeling. The film then has a great challenge to face : to convince us that we are not in some kind of erotic attraction and nothing else, but that we have real love behind this sudden decision to marry as fast as the parents will agree, can agree, have to agree. The film does that rather well and thus we can say we have here a pretty good film that shows how love, human nature can negate any kind of prejudice provided the humans in question are able to face the opposition they will meet in society, even today and even more than ever today because the more time passes the more vicious and insidious this racism becomes, though when it explodes into some kind of riot or posse or vigilantic attempt it is uglier than anything we can imagine but no more no less ugly than what it has always been.

Sherwin,"[0, 0]","Guess Who's Coming to Dinner may officially be dated; but there are still many people in our nation (and the world) who would prefer not to date, let alone marry, someone outside their own race or religion. This fine movie paints a poignant, emotional portrait of how older parents of a young interracial couple experience powerful knee-jerk reactions as they confront the issue of love between blacks and whites in their times.At the outset of the picture, young Joey Drayton (Katharine Houghton) brings home her brand new boyfriend Dr. John Wade Prentice (Sidney Poitier) so that he can meet her parents. Unfortunately, Joey's parents Matt and Christina Drayton (Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn), are in for quite a shock! Joey's fianc&eacute; is African American, older than she--and they intend to marry almost immediately if Joey's parents Matt and Christina approve of it literally that very day before John must travel to Switzerland to accept a job offer. Adding to the roster of people and the emotional baggage are John Prentice's parents Mr. and Mrs. Prentice (Roy Glenn and Beah Richards).The shock hits the parents hard. Matt Drayton asks John Prentice's parents to fly to their home in San Francisco from their home in Los Angeles to have a major discussion as to what should be done about the situation. Matt is not too concerned about the topic of interracial marriage in general; but when it comes to his daughter he worries quite a bit about the prejudice she and her new husband would face if they were to actually marry. Interracial marriages were not common when this film was made; and there is much to be considered in very little time by both sets of parents.Look for some very moving scenes between John Prentice and his father as they passionately discuss race and romance between the races; and Matt Drayton's final speech about their daughter's love for her fianc&eacute; is probably one of the best moments in all of cinematic history. Moreover, Katherine Hepburn as Christina Drayton turns in a brilliant, Oscar winning performance; Isabel Sanford makes her movie debut as Tillie, the maid in the Drayton's home; and Cecil Kellaway does a great job of playing Monsignor Ryan who believes interracial marriages can work out despite people's prejudices against these couples.Guess Who's Coming to Dinner gives us a well-done view on race relations that can still ring true all too often even in our times. The convincing acting is some of the best I've ever seen.

The chemistry between the two of them was never more  powerful or moving than in this film.  They both knew this was his farewell  performance, and it's hard to watch it without tears.  And the love story,  if you put your brain in neutral, is charming. Poitier gives a fine  performance (has any actor, ever, given three more memorable performances  in one calendar year than &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, &quot;To  Sir With Love&quot;, and &quot;Guess Who's Coming to Dinner&quot;?).So  what's wrong with this film?  Well, if you think about the issues  realistically, this film is VERY dated.  The airheaded daughter of a  wealthy white couple comes home to introduce her fiance.  He is the kind of  prospective son-in-law whom any sane parents would go delirious over: a  world-renowned doctor, a big wheel in the World Health Organization,  dignified, educated, presumably financially comfortable.  So why would  anyone object?Because he's Black.The rest of the film is devoted to  the debates between and within the two sets of parents about whether the  marriage should take place. Generally the two mothers approve and the two  fathers disapprove.  Guess who wins?The idea that the filmmakers had to  make the fiance so preposterously wonderful in order to make him seem even  an acceptable match for this sawdust-brained rich girl seems completely  laughable in the year 2000. Furthermore, why so much fuss over getting the  parents to approve?  Nowadays if the two of them wanted to get married,  they would GET married - and the hell with their parents!  For these  reasons, the film has not aged well.If you can suspend your 21st-century  attitudes toward love, race and marriage, then this film is charming.

At this point, I start getting choked up during the opening credit sequence where they're walking through the airport. It is really difficult to choose a favorite from among the many excellent scenes (including that final monologue, which is even more of a tear-jerker when one knows more about the story of the filming of the movie and the health and relationships of the actors), but I must say that my favorite scene of all is Katharine Hepburn's scene in the driveway with Hilary. I want to memorize it like a poem just so I can recite it to myself and enjoy it whenever I want. Every word is delivered flawlessly.Katharine Hepburn is surely one of the greatest American actresses of the 20th century, and this is absolutely among her very best work. Sidney Poitier is wonderful as the devoted and practical Dr. John Wade Prentice; Spencer Tracy is excellent as the concerned father, and Beah Richards is amazing as always.

18264,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,0767825616,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[8, 13]","A white, upper-middle class liberal couple's beliefs are tested when their daughter comes home from Hawaii and announces her engagement to a black man, one that is much older than she is and one she had only known for nearly two weeks, I might add. However, his age and the amount of time between them meeting to being engaged never even seemed to be a factor. Obviously, race was the ONLY factor.I liked this movie, but I found a couple of things in the plot to be quite unbelievable...like the Poitier character, who is a doctor (would have been more interesting if he was an average middle class guy who was a factory foreman or a mailman, like his father - that way you get not only a clash with race, but also with status) and his white fiancee didn't really seem to have any kind of rapport. If these two were in love, maybe I missed something, because it didn't show. Plus the girl, who can't really act, seems to be TOO naive not to see that her marrying a black man would cause some controversy. I can't believe the writers made her that dumb. I guess they were trying to make her so idealistic that her man's race wasn't even a factor, so I can kind of understand what they were going for. But other than that, the performances in this film are great. The speeches that Beah Richards and Spencer Tracy give at the end is priceless, and watching Katherine Hepburn watch HIM is too much. This was Tracy's final film before his death, so if you're a fan of his work, I suggest that you see it. This movie, even though it was made in 1967 when interracial couples had a rougher time of it, does make you think, though...how would you feel if it were YOUR son or daughter in this same position?

The form it takes in this excellent movie is racial prejudice.  This movie is not nearly as dated as some of us would be happy to believe.  Prejudice based on race is still alive and flourishing in the world. It would be wonderful if everyone could come to the conclusion that Mr. and Mrs. Drayton did, that race is not a big enough difference to cause trouble or to divide us.  We all CAN live peacefully together, accepting our differences, cultures and traditions - if we choose to do so.  This movie is beautifully written and even more beautifully acted.  Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy give their finest performances of their careers and they will touch your heart as the movie unfolds.  This movie is truthful and real. I appreciate the fact that they chose to have Sidney Poitier play a successful doctor because I believe it clarifies the movies point... the prejudice felt against Dr. Prentice was specifically and fully based on his race!  No other issues could play a part in their hesitancy to have him as a son-in-law.  He was articulate, passionate, strong-willed, intelligent, successful and obviously in love with Joey!  This is a vital aspect of this movie.  I have experienced prejudice first hand since my husband and I are of different races and I find &quot;Guess Whose Coming to Dinner&quot; to be an important movie for society.
