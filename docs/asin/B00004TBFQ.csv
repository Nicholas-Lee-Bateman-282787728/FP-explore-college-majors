550212,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00004TBFQ,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 1]","DIVINE TRASH is an excellent 1998 documentary that follows underground filmmaker, Baltimorean John Waters, from his early experiments with a gift movie camera to his shocking - and highly amusing - early works like MONDO TRASHO, MULTIPLE MANIACS and PINK FLAMINGOS (1972).  Actors in Waters films, including David Lochary, Edith Massey and Mink Stole, are there to reminisce, not only on how the films were shot but how they were promoted and screened (in the beginning, with flyers under car windshields and showings in rented church basements).  Acquaintances like Steve Buscemi and promoters like Hal Hartley also bear witness.  (Kenneth Anger and Russ Meyer were approached, but would not be interviewed.)  High points include interview footage of Waters' own bemused, but supportive parents; highly opinionated takes from Waters' biggest career non-supporter, the woman who was the last professional censor for the State of Maryland; posthumous footage of Harris Glen Milstead (d. 1988), who played Waters own ""favorite transvestite"" and lodestone Divine; and on-set home movies from PINK FLAMINGOS, including the technical aspect of burning the primary-set trailer.  Although this documentary was made in 1998, most of the narrative is concerned with the period predating the late 1970s, so do not expect to see more mainstream actors like Tab Hunter or Kathleen Turner who appeared in Waters' later, more generously funded comedies.  But DIVINE TRASH is a well-crafted, enjoyable look at Waters' life and mission, enlivened by filmed interviews with the auteur himself at various points in his career.  The film makes a fairly good point of promoting Waters as a seminal indie filmmaker of the 1960s and 1970s while revealing just how funny those  pix were.  A very good companion to DIVINE TRASH, of course, would be the DVD of PINK FLAMINGOS, readily available and reasonably priced.",5,Well-done and quite fun,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,1892,"['DIVINE', 'TRASH', 'excellent', '1998', 'documentary', 'underground', 'filmmaker', 'Baltimorean', 'John', 'Waters', 'early', 'experiments', 'gift', 'movie', 'camera', 'shocking', 'highly', 'amusing', 'early', 'works', 'MONDO', 'TRASHO', 'MULTIPLE', 'MANIACS', 'PINK', 'FLAMINGOS', '1972', 'Actors', 'Waters', 'films', 'including', 'David', 'Lochary', 'Edith', 'Massey', 'Mink', 'Stole', 'are', 'there', 'reminisce', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'films', 'were', 'shot', 'how', 'were', 'promoted', 'screened', 'beginning', 'flyers', 'car', 'windshields', 'showings', 'rented', 'church', 'basements', 'Acquaintances', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'promoters', 'Hal', 'Hartley', 'also', 'bear', 'witness', 'Kenneth', 'Anger', 'Russ', 'Meyer', 'were', 'approached', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'interviewed', 'High', 'points', 'include', 'interview', 'footage', 'Waters', 'own', 'bemused', 'supportive', 'parents', 'highly', 'opinionated', 'Waters', 'biggest', 'career', 'non-supporter', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'last', 'professional', 'censor', 'State', 'Maryland', 'posthumous', 'footage', 'Harris', 'Glen', 'Milstead', 'd.', '1988', 'who', 'played', 'Waters', 'favorite', 'transvestite', 'lodestone', 'Divine', 'on-set', 'home', 'movies', 'PINK', 'FLAMINGOS', 'including', 'technical', 'aspect', 'burning', 'primary-set', 'trailer', 'documentary', 'was', 'made', '1998', 'most', 'narrative', 'concerned', 'period', 'predating', 'late', '1970s', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'see', 'more', 'mainstream', 'actors', 'Tab', 'Hunter', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'who', 'appeared', 'Waters', 'later', 'more', 'generously', 'funded', 'comedies', 'DIVINE', 'TRASH', 'well-crafted', 'enjoyable', 'look', 'Waters', 'life', 'mission', 'enlivened', 'filmed', 'interviews', 'auteur', 'various', 'points', 'career', 'film', 'fairly', 'good', 'point', 'promoting', 'Waters', 'seminal', 'indie', 'filmmaker', '1960s', '1970s', 'revealing', 'just', 'how', 'funny', 'pix', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'companion', 'DIVINE', 'TRASH', 'course', 'would', 'be', 'DVD', 'PINK', 'FLAMINGOS', 'readily', 'available', 'reasonably', 'priced']",Divine Trash

There's something subversive and anti-establishment about them.  Well, John Waters was turning out sick and twisted entertainment years before it was fashionable, and he used live actors, not animated characters, to play out his acid-trip stories in his belovedly filthy Baltimore.  &quot;Divine Trash&quot; is an extremely interesting and well made documentary following Waters, his cast and crew during the filming of the infamous &quot;Pink Flamingos,&quot; the film in which Divine ingests dog excrement to prove she is &quot;the filthiest person alive.&quot;  It's fascinating to see Waters interviewed today, as a more grounded middle aged man, as well as then, as an obviously chemically altered young director without a care in the world other than getting his vision on film.  Actors Mink Stole, David Lochary, Edith Massey and the late, great Divine (on set and in drag during &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;) are interviewed as are various crew members, friends, and even foes, most notably a board member responsible for viewing Waters' work before assigning it a motion picture rating.  Many might dismiss Waters' films as talentless trash, but I stand in awe of a writer/director who can plumb the depths of bad taste and create hilarious dialogue for actors who are not quite actors playing characters we've never seen before and are surely never to see again.  It's also interesting to see the grass roots beginnings of a film maker who would eventually go on to make more mainstream comedies like &quot;Polyester,&quot; &quot;Hairspray&quot; and &quot;Serial Mom.&quot;  Waters may not be your cup of tea, but &quot;Divine Trash&quot; is fascinating for documentary fans.",5,A Cause for Waters' Fans to Celebrate!,980467200,"01 26, 2001",2001,1810,"['days', 'quot', 'sick', 'twisted', 'quot', 'animation', 'festivals', 'are', 'very', 'popular', 'country', 'especially', 'college', 'towns', 'something', 'subversive', 'anti-establishment', 'Well', 'John', 'Waters', 'was', 'turning', 'out', 'sick', 'twisted', 'entertainment', 'years', 'was', 'fashionable', 'used', 'live', 'actors', 'not', 'animated', 'characters', 'play', 'out', 'acid-trip', 'stories', 'belovedly', 'filthy', 'Baltimore', 'quot', 'Divine', 'Trash', 'quot', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'well', 'made', 'documentary', 'following', 'Waters', 'cast', 'crew', 'filming', 'infamous', 'quot', 'Pink', 'Flamingos', 'quot', 'film', 'Divine', 'dog', 'excrement', 'prove', 'quot', 'filthiest', 'person', 'alive.', 'quot', 'fascinating', 'see', 'Waters', 'interviewed', 'today', 'more', 'grounded', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'obviously', 'chemically', 'altered', 'young', 'director', 'care', 'world', 'other', 'getting', 'vision', 'film', 'Actors', 'Mink', 'Stole', 'David', 'Lochary', 'Edith', 'Massey', 'late', 'great', 'Divine', 'set', 'drag', 'quot', 'Pink', 'Flamingos', 'quot', 'are', 'interviewed', 'are', 'various', 'crew', 'members', 'friends', 'even', 'foes', 'most', 'notably', 'board', 'member', 'responsible', 'viewing', 'Waters', 'work', 'assigning', 'motion', 'picture', 'rating', 'Many', 'might', 'dismiss', 'Waters', 'films', 'talentless', 'trash', 'stand', 'awe', 'writer/director', 'who', 'can', 'plumb', 'depths', 'bad', 'taste', 'create', 'hilarious', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'actors', 'playing', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'are', 'surely', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'grass', 'roots', 'beginnings', 'film', 'maker', 'who', 'would', 'eventually', 'go', 'make', 'more', 'mainstream', 'comedies', 'quot', 'Polyester', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hairspray', 'quot', 'quot', 'Serial', 'Mom.', 'quot', 'Waters', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'quot', 'Divine', 'Trash', 'quot', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'fans']",Divine Trash

Walker ""geminiwalker""","[2, 4]","First let me say how pleased I was to find this DVD at my local public library!From there I will go on to say what an impressive piece of work this is. Having long been a fan of the movie Hairspray, which raised my curiosity about Divine in the first place, a natural progression enabled my curiosity about John Waters. This is primarily his story, the story of his work, with plenty of interview time with him. What an intriguing individual! What a creative time and place he lived in! How fortunate for all freedom loving Americans that such explorations were possible in that time and place. I doubt they could ever happen today.True, the films do seem to be in questionable taste, with little, if any, socially redeeming value. But look closer, and you may find your own reflection. What is the value of shock value? What are its drawbacks? What have we gained? What have we lost?John Waters was not shallow, nor was he untintelligent. He was creatively inspired, and no matter how we react to his work, react we do. Such is the nature of art.I feel like I got to know the man just a little, which is exactly what I wanted to do. I understood a little more about his work, and its success. Do I approve? I still don't know, but I do know that whether I approve or not doesn't matter.I do approve of freedom. I believe that no one was hurt, and that violence was not empowered through the message, which makes many of today's movies filthy in comparison.John Waters is an interesting individual. It would have been intruging to have been in his entourage. One could not have escaped coming out a changed individual. He created a cocoon, a chrysalis, where larvae were nurtured and outrageous butterflies emerged. They loved what they were doing, and they were successful.If nothing else, it is a deep meditation on the nature of success in a country that considers it a superior export....geminiwalker",5,A deep meditation on the nature of success,1081900800,"04 14, 2004",2004,1904,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'how', 'pleased', 'was', 'find', 'DVD', 'local', 'public', 'library', 'will', 'go', 'say', 'what', 'impressive', 'piece', 'work', 'Having', 'long', 'been', 'fan', 'movie', 'Hairspray', 'raised', 'curiosity', 'Divine', 'first', 'place', 'natural', 'progression', 'enabled', 'curiosity', 'John', 'Waters', 'primarily', 'story', 'story', 'work', 'plenty', 'interview', 'time', 'What', 'intriguing', 'individual', 'What', 'creative', 'time', 'place', 'lived', 'How', 'fortunate', 'freedom', 'loving', 'Americans', 'such', 'explorations', 'were', 'possible', 'time', 'place', 'doubt', 'could', 'ever', 'happen', 'today.True', 'films', 'do', 'seem', 'be', 'questionable', 'taste', 'little', 'socially', 'redeeming', 'value', 'look', 'closer', 'may', 'find', 'own', 'reflection', 'What', 'value', 'shock', 'value', 'What', 'are', 'drawbacks', 'What', 'have', 'gained', 'What', 'have', 'lost', 'John', 'Waters', 'was', 'not', 'shallow', 'was', 'untintelligent', 'was', 'creatively', 'inspired', 'matter', 'how', 'react', 'work', 'react', 'do', 'Such', 'nature', 'art.I', 'feel', 'got', 'know', 'man', 'just', 'little', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'understood', 'little', 'more', 'work', 'success', 'Do', 'approve', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', 'know', 'approve', 'not', ""n't"", 'matter.I', 'do', 'approve', 'freedom', 'believe', 'one', 'was', 'hurt', 'violence', 'was', 'not', 'empowered', 'message', 'many', 'today', 'movies', 'filthy', 'comparison.John', 'Waters', 'interesting', 'individual', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'intruging', 'have', 'been', 'entourage', 'One', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'escaped', 'coming', 'out', 'changed', 'individual', 'created', 'cocoon', 'chrysalis', 'where', 'larvae', 'were', 'nurtured', 'outrageous', 'butterflies', 'emerged', 'loved', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'were', 'successful.If', 'nothing', 'else', 'deep', 'meditation', 'nature', 'success', 'country', 'superior', 'export', '.geminiwalker']",Divine Trash

She makes for great contrast.  I swear she is the original &quot;Divine&quot; in denial.

Sherwin,"[1, 1]","I first found out about John Waters when I was a high school student and a buddy of mine told me that his mother had taken him and his brother to see the movie ""Polyester."" We rented it one time and although I was somewhat startled, I was also interested enough to make a mental note of this man's name and I tried hard to track down a copy of ""Polyester"" for my own video collection. I didn't know much about John Waters' past but I thought he had a hit with ""Polyester."" I was also wondering if he had had more success with other films.Flash forward several years. I was really happy to add ""Polyester"" to my DVD collection; and I loved `Hairspray"" and ""Cry-Baby"" in particular. I knew more about John Waters than before and to learn even more about him I got this DVD and watched it.This movie does an excellent job of telling the story of John Waters; the interview footage with his family members, friends and colleagues is all extremely interesting. We get both recent and archival footage with Waters himself being interviewed as well.  There's even footage of the last censor in Maryland, an elderly woman who is the only one interviewed in this film who dislikes John's work! We learn that he encouraged a whole subculture of would-be movie-makers to be confident about their abilities and make the movies that they really wanted to make. I can truly say I learned a lot about John Waters by watching this movie. There's also great, great footage with actors who worked with John and who starred in his films; I liked the interviews with Mink Stole, David Lochary and Edith Massey. The interview footage of the late actor Divine and footage of Divine's acting both onscreen and onstage is the film's tender tribute to this character actor.Unfortunately, however, although this was released in 1998 the film stops shortly after John's movie ""Pink Flamingos"" hit the theaters. I've seen ""Pink Flamingos"" and it is worthy of discussion; but I don't think that they should have gone into it in such detail here. I'm also left wondering why there's no mention of ""Hairspray,"" which was a huge, huge coup for Waters and his stars--why this isn't given any time at all remains a mystery to me! It would have shown just how far John Waters as an unconventional, creative artist, always thinking outside of the box, became quite famous and probably wealthy. Wouldn't this have encouraged budding film-makers and artists even more?The extras are slight but they're informative. We get three sets of filmographies and awards for John Waters, Divine and Steve Yeager who produced this documentary in addition to doing some acting in a few films including ""Pink Flamingos"" and ""Polyester.""Overall, Divine Trash does an excellent job of telling John Water's unique and remarkable story; it's quite engaging, too. However, the film inexplicably stops with Pink Flamingos which was released in 1972 and I don't know why a documentary that was done in 1998 stops with John Waters' history in 1972. John was still living and he was experiencing greater success than ever before by 1998. Nevertheless, what we do get is excellent; and I do recommend this for John Waters' fans although it's not as complete a documentary as it really should be. In addition, people who like the stars in John's films will enjoy this.",4,"very, very good--as far as it goes, that is...",1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,3306,"['first', 'found', 'out', 'John', 'Waters', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'buddy', 'mine', 'told', 'mother', 'had', 'taken', 'brother', 'see', 'movie', 'Polyester', 'rented', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'somewhat', 'startled', 'was', 'also', 'interested', 'enough', 'make', 'mental', 'note', 'man', 'name', 'tried', 'hard', 'track', 'down', 'copy', 'Polyester', 'own', 'video', 'collection', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'John', 'Waters', 'past', 'thought', 'had', 'hit', 'Polyester', 'was', 'also', 'wondering', 'had', 'had', 'more', 'success', 'other', 'films.Flash', 'forward', 'several', 'years', 'was', 'really', 'happy', 'add', 'Polyester', 'DVD', 'collection', 'loved', 'Hairspray', 'Cry-Baby', 'particular', 'knew', 'more', 'John', 'Waters', 'before', 'learn', 'even', 'more', 'got', 'DVD', 'watched', 'it.This', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'John', 'Waters', 'interview', 'footage', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'get', 'recent', 'archival', 'footage', 'Waters', 'being', 'interviewed', 'well', 'even', 'footage', 'last', 'censor', 'Maryland', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'interviewed', 'film', 'who', 'John', 'work', 'learn', 'encouraged', 'whole', 'subculture', 'would-be', 'movie-makers', 'be', 'confident', 'abilities', 'make', 'movies', 'really', 'wanted', 'make', 'can', 'truly', 'say', 'learned', 'lot', 'John', 'Waters', 'watching', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'great', 'footage', 'actors', 'who', 'worked', 'John', 'who', 'starred', 'films', 'liked', 'interviews', 'Mink', 'Stole', 'David', 'Lochary', 'Edith', 'Massey', 'interview', 'footage', 'late', 'actor', 'Divine', 'footage', 'Divine', 'acting', 'onscreen', 'onstage', 'film', 'tender', 'tribute', 'character', 'actor.Unfortunately', 'however', 'was', 'released', '1998', 'film', 'shortly', 'John', 'movie', 'Pink', 'Flamingos', 'hit', 'theaters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Pink', 'Flamingos', 'worthy', 'discussion', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'such', 'detail', 'here', ""'m"", 'also', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'mention', 'Hairspray', 'was', 'huge', 'huge', 'coup', 'Waters', 'stars', 'why', ""n't"", 'given', 'time', 'mystery', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'John', 'Waters', 'unconventional', 'creative', 'artist', 'always', 'thinking', 'box', 'became', 'quite', 'famous', 'probably', 'wealthy', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'encouraged', 'budding', 'film-makers', 'artists', 'even', 'more', 'extras', 'are', 'slight', ""'re"", 'informative', 'get', 'three', 'sets', 'filmographies', 'awards', 'John', 'Waters', 'Divine', 'Steve', 'Yeager', 'who', 'produced', 'documentary', 'addition', 'doing', 'acting', 'few', 'films', 'including', 'Pink', 'Flamingos', 'Polyester', 'Overall', 'Divine', 'Trash', 'excellent', 'job', 'telling', 'John', 'Water', 'unique', 'remarkable', 'story', 'quite', 'engaging', 'too', 'However', 'film', 'inexplicably', 'Pink', 'Flamingos', 'was', 'released', '1972', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'documentary', 'was', 'done', '1998', 'stops', 'John', 'Waters', 'history', '1972', 'John', 'was', 'still', 'living', 'was', 'experiencing', 'greater', 'success', 'ever', '1998', 'Nevertheless', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'excellent', 'do', 'recommend', 'John', 'Waters', 'fans', 'not', 'complete', 'documentary', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'addition', 'people', 'who', 'stars', 'John', 'films', 'will', 'enjoy']",Divine Trash

But what kind of Frankenstein could have created ""HIr?""  This little movie provides the answer!Of course, the answer is: the deliciously hillarious perverted mind of John Waters!  William S. Burroughs coined him as ""The Pope Of Trash!""  Yet Waters was raised normally in an upper class Baltimore family!  Is it his fault that he became as a child obsessed with car accidents, trials of murderers and sleasy ""B"" movies?  How could such environmental influences create the most tastefully outrageous antics depicted in his earlier films?  This movie provides the answer!There is a difference between mere shocking bad taste and bad taste that is so good that it generates a cult following!  Here we see the delicious Divine give interviews that are as shocking as HIr films!  We see the deliciously ugly Edith Massey glory in her new roles of glamor and stardom in John's movies.  We see the hours and hours of rehearsals that Divine and the Dreamlanders did in front of the perfectionist Waters' cameras.  There was a lot of work and planning that went on in even the most notorious scene of ""Pink Flamingos:"" the infamous Dog-Spoor scene!John Waters.... we all await the day that you can once again release the tiger in you that created your early works!
