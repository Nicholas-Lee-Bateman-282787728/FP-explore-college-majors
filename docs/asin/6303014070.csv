350747,A2YH3YTPSCAWF9,6303014070,"Anthony Marinelli ""marilread""","[1, 1]","Its good to see old stars in a movie although of historical interest not considered their best. Clark Gable was hollywood's greatest star, King,and its interesting how he got this title. If we look at his film,he always portrayed a tough guy,he-man,and the image was one who was aggressive and i found his films interesting for the romantic tales of his movies,without a strong female lead and romance his movie seemed like their was somrthing missing,and at times their was more than one woman of interest,but he eventually settled on one. He was married to the famous carole lombard and was inprobably the most famous of hollywood films gone with the wind. Ava gardner was one of the most famous and riveting stars of the 50's glamourous and put to good use in the popular filmsmogambo(1953) and barefoot contesssa(1954) and was briefly married to Frank Sinatra. She was never absorbed with the men she married and it was a source of problems in all her interpersonal relations,and the nightlife took her in all kinds of directions. Gable had a few hits beside gone with the wind,but if you look over his films,there are many mediocre films,there were famous films like it happenned one night(1934)San Francisco(1936)Gone with the wind(1939)HUcksters(1947)Command decision(1948)Mogambo(1953) but he broke his longcontract with mgm mid 50's and freelanced. However,he always complained to be put in better films,and very often there are trivial stories,where the romance is all their is to the tale,and given his appeal that's what fans wanted to see him in. Years later after his death,his reputation declined. Living on a border down 30 years ago,you rarely saw his films replayed,I actually saw them very late at night on canadian tv,but its good that the films are released now giving all a chance to see his films,and i always liked the stories heavy on romance and at times with several starlets,in often male centered tales. This story tries to be reminiscent of Gone with the wind,rereleased during the 50's as his later film also, Band of Angels and here the romance between the star has little time to develop with the historical tales of indians,forces for and against Texas joining the U.S. and historical interest about Mexico and theother european powers. It always seemed that Texas was always a part of america,so central it is to the country,but it joined later on. The film is honest in showing the forces for and against,and even forces just looking for money,but there is too much going on,and the history is interesting and i'm glad they made this film,but at the time it was badly reviewed,a film trying to recapture the glory of Gone with the wind. The dialogue of the gable-gardner romance with lines like ""your a lot of man' and 'your a lot of woman' seems somewhat laughable,and the romance never pleases,but Gardner is always great to see in a film,the highlight of hollywood in the 50's,and she here sings a song,her career fizzled at times during the 60's,and her life seemed to breakdown,and she never recaptured the greatness of her 50's films. Gable was a big star til his death,always larger than life and king,and near the end of his life did an interesting series of european type films mogambo,the cold war inspired Never let me go,and with sophia loren It stated in Naples,aboutpostwar life centered in Naples which photographed the city very splendidly,a city never really brought to life in film, but he remains an entertaining star. The two big stars the old hollywood star system made,but often were put like most of the old stars,through mediocre films.",3,Old stars perk story of texas joining america,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,3596,"['good', 'see', 'old', 'stars', 'movie', 'historical', 'interest', 'not', 'considered', 'best', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'was', 'hollywood', 'greatest', 'star', 'King', 'interesting', 'how', 'got', 'title', 'look', 'film', 'always', 'portrayed', 'tough', 'guy', 'he-man', 'image', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'aggressive', 'i', 'found', 'films', 'interesting', 'romantic', 'tales', 'movies', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'romance', 'movie', 'seemed', 'was', 'somrthing', 'missing', 'times', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'woman', 'interest', 'eventually', 'settled', 'one', 'was', 'married', 'famous', 'carole', 'lombard', 'was', 'inprobably', 'most', 'famous', 'hollywood', 'films', 'gone', 'wind', 'Ava', 'gardner', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'riveting', 'stars', '50', 'glamourous', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'popular', 'filmsmogambo', '1953', 'barefoot', 'contesssa', '1954', 'was', 'briefly', 'married', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'was', 'never', 'absorbed', 'men', 'married', 'was', 'source', 'problems', 'interpersonal', 'relations', 'nightlife', 'took', 'kinds', 'directions', 'Gable', 'had', 'few', 'hits', 'gone', 'wind', 'look', 'films', 'are', 'many', 'mediocre', 'films', 'were', 'famous', 'films', 'happenned', 'one', 'night', '1934', 'San', 'Francisco', '1936', 'Gone', 'wind', '1939', 'HUcksters', '1947', 'Command', 'decision', '1948', 'Mogambo', '1953', 'broke', 'longcontract', 'mgm', 'mid', '50', 'freelanced', 'However', 'always', 'complained', 'be', 'put', 'better', 'films', 'very', 'often', 'are', 'trivial', 'stories', 'where', 'romance', 'tale', 'given', 'appeal', 'what', 'wanted', 'see', 'Years', 'later', 'death', 'reputation', 'declined', 'Living', 'border', 'down', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'rarely', 'saw', 'films', 'replayed', 'actually', 'saw', 'very', 'late', 'night', 'canadian', 'tv', 'good', 'films', 'are', 'released', 'now', 'giving', 'chance', 'see', 'films', 'i', 'always', 'liked', 'stories', 'heavy', 'romance', 'times', 'several', 'starlets', 'often', 'male', 'centered', 'tales', 'story', 'be', 'reminiscent', 'Gone', 'wind', 'rereleased', '50', 'later', 'film', 'also', 'Band', 'Angels', 'here', 'romance', 'star', 'little', 'time', 'develop', 'historical', 'tales', 'indians', 'forces', 'Texas', 'joining', 'U.S.', 'historical', 'interest', 'Mexico', 'theother', 'european', 'powers', 'always', 'seemed', 'Texas', 'was', 'always', 'part', 'america', 'central', 'country', 'joined', 'later', 'film', 'honest', 'showing', 'forces', 'even', 'forces', 'just', 'looking', 'money', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'history', 'interesting', 'i', ""'m"", 'glad', 'made', 'film', 'time', 'was', 'badly', 'reviewed', 'film', 'trying', 'recapture', 'glory', 'Gone', 'wind', 'dialogue', 'gable-gardner', 'romance', 'lines', 'lot', 'man', 'lot', 'woman', 'somewhat', 'laughable', 'romance', 'never', 'Gardner', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'film', 'highlight', 'hollywood', '50', 'here', 'song', 'career', 'fizzled', 'times', '60', 'life', 'seemed', 'breakdown', 'never', 'recaptured', 'greatness', '50', 'films', 'Gable', 'was', 'big', 'star', 'death', 'always', 'larger', 'life', 'king', 'end', 'life', 'did', 'interesting', 'series', 'european', 'type', 'films', 'mogambo', 'cold', 'war', 'inspired', 'Never', 'let', 'go', 'sophia', 'loren', 'stated', 'Naples', 'aboutpostwar', 'life', 'centered', 'Naples', 'photographed', 'city', 'very', 'splendidly', 'city', 'never', 'really', 'brought', 'life', 'film', 'entertaining', 'star', 'two', 'big', 'stars', 'old', 'hollywood', 'star', 'system', 'made', 'often', 'were', 'put', 'most', 'old', 'stars', 'mediocre', 'films']",N/A
350748,A3N95R1VKWROWF,6303014070,Christopher Schwinger,"[11, 11]","Clark Gable liked to make westerns, according to imdb.com, and I think he excels at the genre.  This movie has great energy, Gable and Gardner are great together, and it's got great dialogue.  On a more personal note, I think it's truly outstanding when a movie gets me more sensitized to the horror of violence, and not since I saw The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance has a movie done that to me, as this one does at the end.  It's interesting how Broderick Crawford, the villain, slowly grows on you as a desperate, ruthless fiend; you know he is early on, but as his determination to gain power plays out, he becomes more and more formidable.  He makes a great villain.",5,"Energetic, with great chemistry between Gable and Gardner",1315440000,"09 8, 2011",2011,669,"['Clark', 'Gable', 'liked', 'make', 'westerns', 'according', 'imdb.com', 'think', 'genre', 'movie', 'great', 'energy', 'Gable', 'Gardner', 'are', 'great', 'together', 'got', 'great', 'dialogue', 'more', 'personal', 'note', 'think', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'when', 'movie', 'more', 'sensitized', 'horror', 'violence', 'not', 'saw', 'Man', 'Who', 'Shot', 'Liberty', 'Valance', 'movie', 'done', 'one', 'end', 'interesting', 'how', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'villain', 'slowly', 'desperate', 'ruthless', 'fiend', 'know', 'early', 'determination', 'gain', 'power', 'plays', 'out', 'more', 'more', 'formidable', 'great', 'villain']",N/A

Harvey ""Cricket ,country music and a go...","[10, 16]","Lone Star was scripted by Borden Chase whose name adorns many an outstanding Western -notably Red River;Bend of the River and The Far Country .Lone Star is not in the same class as these movies  partly because they had directors with exceptional talent in Hawks and Anthony Mann ,  while Lone Star is directed by the studio hack Vincent Sherman.In part the reason lies with the script .Chase was the co-founder of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals ,a body designed to worship at the altar of the repulsive Senator McCarthy and his script here is biased and one sided in its consideration of the issues posed by the movie.The setting is Texas in the 1840's when the then independent Republic is torn between maintaining its status or becoming part of the Union.Texan cattle baron Burke -played with customary forthrightness by Gable-is sent by President Jackson to locate the missing Sam Houston and get him to side with the faction calling for admission to the  Union .He meeets up with Broderick Crawford on the way and Crawford is fanatical about Texan independence and indeed dreams of an even bigger Texas ,one that occupies most of the land below the Mason-Dixon line ,a state in alliance with Mexico and Britain and in a position to cahallenge the Union itself as the chief power in North America.Gable falls in love with a newspaper proprietor -played by the fetching Gardner and the feeling is returned ,which complicates matters since she is close to Crawford and others on the independence faction.Events move at a brisk pace to the final siege of the legislature with Crawford trying to influence the vote on a key treaty, and indeed the action  is well staged throughout,and a cast of solid supporting actors lend weight to proceedings.What stops it from being better than it is is a plodding quality to the direction and a lack of any real spark between the leading players who are competent but not charismatic enough to lift matters.Okay but nothing special and for Western lovers only",3,Texas set  Western,1063584000,"09 15, 2003",2003,2034,"['Lone', 'Star', 'was', 'scripted', 'Borden', 'Chase', 'name', 'many', 'outstanding', 'Western', '-notably', 'Red', 'River', 'Bend', 'River', 'Far', 'Country', '.Lone', 'Star', 'not', 'same', 'class', 'movies', 'partly', 'had', 'directors', 'exceptional', 'talent', 'Hawks', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'Lone', 'Star', 'directed', 'studio', 'hack', 'Vincent', 'Sherman.In', 'part', 'reason', 'script', '.Chase', 'was', 'co-founder', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Alliance', 'Preservation', 'American', 'Ideals', 'body', 'designed', 'worship', 'altar', 'repulsive', 'Senator', 'McCarthy', 'script', 'here', 'biased', 'one', 'sided', 'consideration', 'issues', 'posed', 'movie.The', 'setting', 'Texas', '1840', 'when', 'then', 'independent', 'Republic', 'torn', 'maintaining', 'status', 'becoming', 'part', 'Union.Texan', 'cattle', 'baron', 'Burke', '-played', 'customary', 'forthrightness', 'Gable-is', 'sent', 'President', 'Jackson', 'locate', 'missing', 'Sam', 'Houston', 'get', 'side', 'faction', 'calling', 'admission', 'Union', '.He', 'up', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'way', 'Crawford', 'fanatical', 'Texan', 'independence', 'indeed', 'dreams', 'even', 'bigger', 'Texas', 'one', 'most', 'land', 'Mason-Dixon', 'line', 'state', 'alliance', 'Mexico', 'Britain', 'position', 'cahallenge', 'Union', 'chief', 'power', 'North', 'America.Gable', 'love', 'newspaper', 'proprietor', '-played', 'fetching', 'Gardner', 'feeling', 'returned', 'matters', 'close', 'Crawford', 'others', 'independence', 'faction.Events', 'move', 'brisk', 'pace', 'final', 'siege', 'legislature', 'Crawford', 'trying', 'influence', 'vote', 'key', 'treaty', 'indeed', 'action', 'well', 'staged', 'cast', 'solid', 'supporting', 'actors', 'lend', 'weight', 'proceedings.What', 'being', 'better', 'plodding', 'quality', 'direction', 'lack', 'real', 'spark', 'leading', 'players', 'who', 'are', 'competent', 'not', 'charismatic', 'enough', 'lift', 'matters.Okay', 'nothing', 'special', 'Western', 'lovers', 'only']",N/A
