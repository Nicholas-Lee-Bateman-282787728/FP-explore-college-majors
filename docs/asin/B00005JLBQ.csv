597745,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JLBQ,A Customer,"[13, 18]","Summary:Michael Sullivan, Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) has a hitman for a father, Michael Sullivan Senior (Tom Hanks), but doesn't know it.  When Michael Jr. follows his dad to a job to find out what it is his dad does, he is caught by his dad and his dad's boss's son, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig (I)), who is the heir to John Rooney's (Paul Newman) fortune.  To cover his tracks, and perhaps out of jealousy, Connor tries to get Michael Senior killed while he kills the rest of the family, including Michael Jr.  But Michael senior catches on to the plot and gets away while Michael Jr. doesn't happen to be home when Connor makes his hit, killing instead Michael senior's wife and other son Peter.  Michael Senior is smart enough to know that he has to skip town, but he also has to avenge his wife's death by killing Connor.  So, the two Sullivan's leave but another hitman, Maguire (Jude Law), is sent to kill them.  Michael Senior tries to bait the Chicago mob bosses to give up Connor Rooney by stealing their money but it doesn't work.  Eventually he realizes that the only way to kill Connor is to kill Connor's dad, John, so the Chicago mob bosses will stop protecting Connor.  Michael Senior avenges the murders and gets away only to end up with Maguire still hunting him.My Comments:This is a remarkable movie.  The acting is superb.  The music is impeccable.  The cinematography is stunning.  It is just an all around wonderful movie.  There is one scene in particular that was just so well done that I'm still amazed.  It is when Michael Senior kills John Rooney.  John and his henchman are crossing the street in a torrential downpour when Michael opens fire.  Instead of hearing both the rain, the gun shots, and the sounds of dying men, all we hear is music as Michael, in slow motion, kills five or six of John Rooney's henchman.  It isn't until John is the only one left standing that the actual sound comes back up and then, when Michael finally kills John, we hear everything.I was thoroughly impressed with the story.  It seemed completely logical and plausible and worked very well.  The movie was tasteful enough not to show gratuitous violence.  Sure, the movie is violent, but there is really no reason to show a lot of it, leaving most of the violence to the audience's imagination.  The focus is the story.  And, the setup to the story is superb.  Michael Jr. is telling the story in retrospect, and discussing whether or not his father, who was a hitman for the mob, was a good man or not.  In the end, Michael Jr. doesn't say whether or not his dad was a good man, that is left up to the viewer to decide, but he does claim him as his dad, which says plenty.Overall, I loved this movie.  If you don't particularly care for violence or are not interested in the mafia, then you may not like this movie as much as I did.  But, you'll probably still be entranced by a very compelling and touching story.  A definite must see.",5,Perfect movie.,1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,2944,"['Summary', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Jr.', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'hitman', 'father', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Senior', 'Tom', 'Hanks', ""n't"", 'know', 'When', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'dad', 'job', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'dad', 'caught', 'dad', 'dad', 'boss', 'son', 'Connor', 'Rooney', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'heir', 'John', 'Rooney', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'fortune', 'cover', 'tracks', 'perhaps', 'jealousy', 'Connor', 'get', 'Michael', 'Senior', 'killed', 'rest', 'family', 'including', 'Michael', 'Jr', 'Michael', 'senior', 'catches', 'plot', 'away', 'Michael', 'Jr.', ""n't"", 'happen', 'be', 'home', 'when', 'Connor', 'hit', 'killing', 'instead', 'Michael', 'senior', 'wife', 'other', 'son', 'Peter', 'Michael', 'Senior', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'skip', 'town', 'also', 'avenge', 'wife', 'death', 'killing', 'Connor', 'So', 'two', 'Sullivan', 'leave', 'hitman', 'Maguire', 'Jude', 'Law', 'sent', 'kill', 'Michael', 'Senior', 'tries', 'bait', 'Chicago', 'mob', 'bosses', 'give', 'up', 'Connor', 'Rooney', 'stealing', 'money', ""n't"", 'work', 'Eventually', 'only', 'way', 'kill', 'Connor', 'kill', 'Connor', 'dad', 'John', 'Chicago', 'mob', 'bosses', 'will', 'stop', 'protecting', 'Connor', 'Michael', 'Senior', 'murders', 'away', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'Maguire', 'still', 'hunting', 'him.My', 'Comments', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'acting', 'superb', 'music', 'impeccable', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'just', 'around', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'well', 'done', ""'m"", 'still', 'amazed', 'when', 'Michael', 'Senior', 'kills', 'John', 'Rooney', 'John', 'henchman', 'are', 'crossing', 'street', 'torrential', 'downpour', 'when', 'Michael', 'fire', 'Instead', 'hearing', 'rain', 'gun', 'shots', 'sounds', 'dying', 'men', 'hear', 'music', 'Michael', 'slow', 'motion', 'five', 'six', 'John', 'Rooney', 'henchman', ""n't"", 'John', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'standing', 'actual', 'sound', 'back', 'up', 'then', 'when', 'Michael', 'finally', 'John', 'hear', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'impressed', 'story', 'seemed', 'completely', 'logical', 'plausible', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'was', 'tasteful', 'enough', 'not', 'show', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'Sure', 'movie', 'violent', 'really', 'reason', 'show', 'lot', 'leaving', 'most', 'violence', 'audience', 'imagination', 'focus', 'story', 'setup', 'story', 'superb', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'telling', 'story', 'retrospect', 'discussing', 'not', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'hitman', 'mob', 'was', 'good', 'man', 'not', 'end', 'Michael', 'Jr.', ""n't"", 'say', 'not', 'dad', 'was', 'good', 'man', 'left', 'up', 'viewer', 'decide', 'claim', 'dad', 'plenty.Overall', 'loved', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'violence', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'mafia', 'then', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'did', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'still', 'be', 'entranced', 'very', 'compelling', 'touching', 'story', 'definite', 'must', 'see']",N/A
597746,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00005JLBQ,Acute Observer,"[1, 20]","The opening scenes are a clue to this slow-paced, boring and pretentious fantasy. The clothes and other settings may be authentic, but the people seem to lack life; they are posed like cardboard characters. The prime of Prohibition was the 1920s, it only slightly overlapped the Great Depression that started about 1929 (earlier in some places).The very idea of a son disappearing and hiding in a car assumes that his parents wouldn't care where he was! Would there really be space to hide under a car seat? Couldn't they have invented a better story? Having little kids hanging around the slot machines seems totally unreal, given the manners of that age. The killing of the family also seems senseless and irrational.It appears that the writing team sat around to imagine the most  shocking ideas for a story, and found the money to film it. But that doesn't mean it would be worth watching for entertainment. Of what use is it? It lacks any redeeming social values.On character speaks of a killer as ""gifted""! Did they use that word then? Other scenes at a funeral, church, and motel also seem unreal. Or is it the lack of background characters? The presence of religious symbols seems to be a studied insult. The shooting at the diner is another ridiculous event. The looting of bank deposits is another unbelievable fantasy. The action at the 'Hotel Geneva' is unbelievable, yet again. The meeting in Church is again unbelievable. The shooting at the ending seemed like a copy of the gangster films of the 1930s (except they were original). The ending seemed like a final joke that wasn't funny, a shocking idea that doesn't work. The end has the boy saying he never touched a gun again; what did he do in The War?Paul Newman should stay in retirement, and the director needs a new career. One comic scene is where the Dad asks his son if he is hungry, and is told ""no"". A teenage boy who isn't hungry?

597747,A2HUU0YW6HNNQE,B00005JLBQ,"A.F. ""musicfan585""","[3, 5]","After being swept away by his brilliant dark comedy AMERICAN BEAUTY a while back, I was hoping that Sam Mendes' second feature, ROAD TO PERDITION, would bring about that same sense of magnificence that he brought to BEAUTY.  Instead, what I got was a flawed and meandering story that didn't stay true to its characters or have anything meaningful to say.  I like a lot of movies, but one of my favorites has always been the gangster films.  Some of the best films ever made have been about organized crime and its damaging effects on a Mafiaoso's soul.  THE GODFATHER I & II.  GOODFELLAS.  ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA.  These are just some of the greatest films that discussed the darker side of being in the mob or the Mafia, and I was hoping ROAD TO PERDITION would be in that same league but alas it was not to be.The story focuses on Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), a hitman for the Irish mob led by the aging but still fearsome John Rooney (Paul Newman).  Rooney treats Sullivan like an only son - much to the dismay of Rooney's real son who is simmering with anger and jealousy.  Michael has a wife and two sons and one night, the oldest son Michael Jr. sneaks in the backseat of his father's car to see what his dad really does for a living.  He witnesses his father and Rooney's son killing a man and that leads to Michael protecting his son from his other ""family.""This sounds like a good story, but in reality, the way it plays on screen is far from the truth.  While it has fine acting, gorgeous cinematography from the late Conrad L. Hall, and a stunning set design, the story is completely empty at its core.  A lot of the revelations are shallow and predictable, and when Michael and his son are supposed to be bonding while on the lam, it feels forced and awkward.  There's a theme running through the movie about fathers and sons, but it never gains full potential.Tom Hanks isn't the best choice for this role.  Although I applaud him for trying something different, this is the first time I can safely say he was miscast in a movie.  He tries to bring his usual Everyman-with-a-heart character into the role of Sullivan, but it never really works.  He winds up becoming too low-key.  In superior gangster movies, the only loyalty a mobster ever gave was to their families: the crime family and their own real family.  Anyone who tried to step on them wouldn't be coming back.  That's the kind of type needed for this role, but Hanks doesn't deliver.  I guess after giving five great performances in a row - PHILADELPHIA, FORREST GUMP, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE GREEN MILE, and CAST AWAY - it was inevitable that Hanks would finally bottom out.The kid who plays his son isn't very memorable.  You would think after seeing your mom and younger brother murdered, you would be traumatized by the event, but Michael Jr. never shows any real emotion and his transition from quiet child to fun-loving thrill seeker is lame.  The rest of the acting is good though.  Paul Newman is both charming and sinister in his all-too-brief supporting turn as Rooney; Jude Law is devilishly scary as a hitman who masquerades as a newspaper photographer; and Stanley Tucci provides balance as Al Capone's right-hand man. (Ironically, Capone is never seen in the film although they filmed scenes with Anthony LaPaligia playing Capone that are pretty good.  Check it out in the Deleted Scenes section of the DVD).With all its high points, I would've expected a better movie.  With a few casting changes and a tighter script, ROAD TO PERDITION could've went somewhere.  As a final product, it's all gloss and no substance.",2,A Seriously Lacking Gangster Saga,1054857600,"06 6, 2003",2003,3613,"['being', 'swept', 'away', 'brilliant', 'dark', 'comedy', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'while', 'back', 'was', 'hoping', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'second', 'feature', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'PERDITION', 'would', 'bring', 'same', 'sense', 'magnificence', 'brought', 'BEAUTY', 'Instead', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'flawed', 'meandering', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'stay', 'true', 'characters', 'have', 'anything', 'meaningful', 'say', 'like', 'lot', 'movies', 'one', 'favorites', 'always', 'been', 'gangster', 'films', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'have', 'been', 'organized', 'crime', 'damaging', 'effects', 'Mafiaoso', 'soul', 'GODFATHER', 'II', 'GOODFELLAS', 'ONCE', 'A', 'TIME', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'are', 'just', 'greatest', 'films', 'discussed', 'darker', 'side', 'being', 'mob', 'Mafia', 'was', 'hoping', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'PERDITION', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'league', 'alas', 'was', 'not', 'be.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'hitman', 'Irish', 'mob', 'led', 'aging', 'still', 'fearsome', 'John', 'Rooney', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Rooney', 'Sullivan', 'only', 'son', 'much', 'dismay', 'Rooney', 'real', 'son', 'who', 'simmering', 'anger', 'jealousy', 'Michael', 'wife', 'two', 'sons', 'one', 'night', 'oldest', 'son', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'sneaks', 'backseat', 'father', 'car', 'see', 'what', 'dad', 'really', 'living', 'father', 'Rooney', 'son', 'killing', 'man', 'Michael', 'protecting', 'son', 'other', 'family', 'good', 'story', 'reality', 'way', 'screen', 'far', 'truth', 'fine', 'acting', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'late', 'Conrad', 'L.', 'Hall', 'stunning', 'set', 'design', 'story', 'completely', 'empty', 'core', 'lot', 'revelations', 'are', 'shallow', 'predictable', 'when', 'Michael', 'son', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'bonding', 'lam', 'forced', 'awkward', 'theme', 'running', 'movie', 'fathers', 'sons', 'never', 'gains', 'full', 'potential.Tom', 'Hanks', ""n't"", 'best', 'choice', 'role', 'applaud', 'trying', 'something', 'different', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'was', 'miscast', 'movie', 'bring', 'usual', 'Everyman-with-a-heart', 'character', 'role', 'Sullivan', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'becoming', 'too', 'low-key', 'superior', 'gangster', 'movies', 'only', 'loyalty', 'mobster', 'ever', 'gave', 'was', 'families', 'crime', 'family', 'own', 'real', 'family', 'Anyone', 'who', 'tried', 'step', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'coming', 'back', 'kind', 'type', 'needed', 'role', 'Hanks', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'guess', 'giving', 'five', 'great', 'performances', 'row', 'PHILADELPHIA', 'FORREST', 'GUMP', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'THE', 'GREEN', 'MILE', 'CAST', 'AWAY', 'was', 'inevitable', 'Hanks', 'would', 'finally', 'bottom', 'out.The', 'kid', 'who', 'son', ""n't"", 'very', 'memorable', 'would', 'think', 'seeing', 'mom', 'younger', 'brother', 'murdered', 'would', 'be', 'traumatized', 'event', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'never', 'real', 'emotion', 'transition', 'quiet', 'child', 'fun-loving', 'thrill', 'seeker', 'lame', 'rest', 'acting', 'good', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'charming', 'sinister', 'all-too-brief', 'supporting', 'turn', 'Rooney', 'Jude', 'Law', 'devilishly', 'scary', 'hitman', 'who', 'newspaper', 'photographer', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'balance', 'Al', 'Capone', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Ironically', 'Capone', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'Anthony', 'LaPaligia', 'playing', 'Capone', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Check', 'out', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'section', 'DVD', 'high', 'points', 'would', ""'ve"", 'expected', 'better', 'movie', 'few', 'casting', 'changes', 'tighter', 'script', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'PERDITION', 'could', ""'ve"", 'went', 'somewhere', 'final', 'product', 'gloss', 'substance']",N/A

597749,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JLBQ,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","I have spent a lot of time in this space writing about my corner boy experiences growing up in my old Irish and Italian working class neighborhood in the late 1950s and early 1960s. I have also spent some time talking about the corner boys who just immediately preceded us in the early 1950s. Pretty tame really although if you were on the receiving end of a vicious beating, got your money stolen in some back alley, or had your personal household possessions ransacked or stolen by some midnight shifter your perspective might not be so romantic. The ""corner boys,"" Irish and Italian mainly, of 1930s Great Depression Chicago though, as portrayed in the film under review, The Road to Perdition, make all that other stuff seem ""punk"" by comparison.Of course the motives to join a gang of lumpenproletarians in all cases were the same then, and today. That is ""where the money was"" to paraphrase the old-time famous bank robber, Willy Sutton. No question all those guys in the 1930s and later were (and are) from hunger. But also looking for the quick dollar and the ""no heavy lifting"" life not associated with steady working class factory every day values. Equally true is the fact that there are always more ""hungry"" guys than the market can bear which leads to two things-external ""turf wars"" between gangs and internal turf wars over who controls what within gangs. And that is the heart of this story.The problem for Tom Hanks, a trusted, very trusted, enforcer (read: ""hit man"") for Irish mob boss Paul Newman (he of many such corner boy roles going back to Cool Hand Luke and before) is that Newman's psychotic son wants his share of the goodies as befits a son and heir apparent. Needless to say that things get dicey, very dicey as they maneuver to the top, including the gangland-style execution of Hanks' family that was suppose to include a son, the narrator of the film, who is forced to help Hanks' seek the inevitable revenge required by the situation. In the end though Tom Waits is right in the opening line from Jersey Girl- ""Ain't got no time for the corner boys, down in the streets making all that noise.""

It's easy to figure out what the basic story is based on the trailer.Tom Hanks plays the calm and collected enforcer, Michael Sullivan, for mob head John Rooney (Paul Newman).  It's his job to collect debts, send messages, and clean up any situation.  He has a wife Annie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and two sons, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) and Peter (Liam Aiken).  Michael Sullivan owes his life to John Rooney, who took him in as a child, raised him and provided for him.  Mr. Rooney has his own son Connor (Daniel Craig) who struggles for his father's approval and attention.  However, he openly shows his affection for Michael and distate for Connor.  Each nod of approval Sullivan gets is if Mr. Rooney were slapping his son in the face saying ""Why couldn't you be more like Michael?""The main conflict of the story arises when Michael Jr. begins to wonder about what his father does for Mr. Rooney.  All he knows is that he goes on dangerous missions for him, and that he carries a gun.  But like any curious adolescent, he decides to find out for himself.  That's when he witnesses the murder of one of Mr. Rooney's employees and his father's hand in it.  Connor spots the young Michael and that's where the real story begins.  How will this story turn out?  You'll have to watch the film.  :)This story also shows the right of passage for Michael Jr.  In the six weeks that he spent with his father, he had to accept the situation they were in and fight to survive.  One of the most poignant scenes in the film is when Michael Jr. is left in a reading room to wait while his father took care of some business.  It was during this time that the full gravity of his situation hit him (his mom and brother were dead, their lives were in danger), and he breaks down in tears.  That was the end of innocence for him.What follows next are carefully crafted moments for the father and son to bond.  One of the funniest scenes in the film is Michael Jr. learning how to drive.  He wouldn't take any suggestions or criticism even from his dad beyond the basic instructions on how to get the car in motion.  He proved to be a quick learner and his skills were soon put to the test as a getaway driver.The plot for this film is easy to follow and action sequences abound.  But the real meat of the story comes with the interaction Michael Sr. has with his son Michael Jr, AND that of Michael Sr. with Mr. Rooney.  When Michael Jr. asks ""Who do you love more?"" Michael Sr. has to pause a moment and say ""I love you both the same.""  Young Michael persists ""But you treat us different.""  It's a conversation every child with a sibling eventually has with their parents.  Being the eldest child, I could relate to the older Sullivan's reply that he treated Michael Jr. different because he was more like him (but he didn't want his son to end up committing the same mistakes his father did).  That was the end of that discussion.  Then we have the father-son relationship between Mr. Rooney and Michael Sr.  There is no doubt that Mr. Rooney would much rather have Michael Sr. as his son.  But blood is blood, and when it comes time to choose blood is thicker than water.I don't think Tom Hanks will get any Best Actor awards for this film.  Despite his good acting, Michael Sr. has to be the calm and composed character.  As a father he has to do the thinking and be the rock.  It leaves little room for Hanks to show his range of emotions.  In one of the climactic events in the story, all we hear is his anguished scream.  No closeups, no last words or last embraces.  This character wasn't written with an award in mind.  And maybe that's a good thing.I believe teenagers to adults will enjoy this film.

He is however somewhat type cast as a good and decent guy and it was hard to picture him as a killer or a gangster.  I think that this fact created a good tension in the film, I felt that the other characters were being true in their roles as bad guys, but I felt that the Hanks character was there because he had to be, not because in his heart he was evil.  Perhaps that tension made the movie better than it could have been had the leading role gone to a more typical ""bad guy"" actor.The son played by Tyler Hoechlin did a great job and I found the Jude Law character to be fascinating and well acted.  Paul Newman doesn't fail to provide a great performance either and the inner conflict he feels is definitely felt onscreen.All that being said, that the acting was terrific, I should say that this is one of those ""thinking and feeling"" type movies much more than it is an action, adventure or gangster film. There is action, yes, and bloodshed but it is not an action packed fast paced movie and sometimes the previews of these types of movies lead people to believe they are something that they aren't.While I recommend watching this film, by all means, it may be one you'd like to rent first.

When his son stows away and witnesses Hanks making a &quot;hit&quot;, and unwittingly becomes an eye witness to Murder, Newman turns on him (Hanks) and sets out to murder his family for the sake of &quot;loose talk&quot; possibly leading to a police investigation. The director sadly, has spent so much time building this depressing, grey and rain soaked backdrop to the movie, that it actually precludes the story from really coming across. Even fans of this kind of dark and brooding mobster style film, will find it implausible for the most part, and even great cinematics cannot unfortunately save it. You the viewer end up frustrated waiting for the story to gather momentum, but it seems to just stagnate, and plod along until the end, which itself is not particularly noteworthy. At just under 2 hours in length, it's also a bit of a trial to endure, and I found myself clock watching on more than one occasion. I don't want to overcritize this picture too much, and Hanks fans will probably enjoy this step away from his usual material, but this is not in the league of the Godfather, or even The Untouchables, I'm sad to say.",2,Too Much Atmosphere - 2.5 Stars,1058313600,"07 16, 2003",2003,1490,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'better', 'theater', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'disappointed', 'seeing', 'several', 'trailers', 'teasers', 'movie.Tom', 'Hanks', 'professional', 'quot', 'Hitman', 'quot', 'beloved', 'quot', 'right', 'hand', 'quot', 'Mobster', 'boss', 'played', 'more', 'little', 'panache', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'depression', 'era', 'When', 'son', 'away', 'Hanks', 'making', 'quot', 'hit', 'quot', 'unwittingly', 'eye', 'witness', 'Murder', 'Newman', 'Hanks', 'out', 'murder', 'family', 'sake', 'quot', 'loose', 'talk', 'quot', 'possibly', 'leading', 'police', 'investigation', 'director', 'sadly', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'building', 'depressing', 'grey', 'rain', 'soaked', 'backdrop', 'movie', 'actually', 'story', 'really', 'coming', 'Even', 'fans', 'kind', 'dark', 'brooding', 'mobster', 'style', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'implausible', 'most', 'part', 'even', 'great', 'cinematics', 'can', 'not', 'unfortunately', 'save', 'viewer', 'end', 'up', 'frustrated', 'waiting', 'story', 'gather', 'momentum', 'just', 'stagnate', 'plod', 'along', 'end', 'not', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'length', 'also', 'bit', 'trial', 'endure', 'found', 'clock', 'watching', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'overcritize', 'picture', 'too', 'much', 'Hanks', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'step', 'away', 'usual', 'material', 'not', 'league', 'Godfather', 'even', 'Untouchables', ""'m"", 'sad', 'say']",N/A
597757,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLBQ,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I feel really sad for Sam Mendes.  I guess I really shouldn't, since he won a Directing Oscar on his first shot out the box in 1999, but in this particular case I feel really bad for him.  Much like the Coen brothers in 1990, Sam Mendes made a wonderful Gangster movie that was trampled over by an inferior one; both by Martin Scorsese.  Sure, `Road to Perdition' is no `Miller's Crossing' (which is a masterpiece), but then again `Gangs of New York' is far from `GoodFellas'.  Truth be told though, `Road to Perdition' is much more controlled, complete and enjoyable than that scattered mess Scorsese campaigned for a Best Picture nomination.The film centers on Michael Sullivan, a strong arm for an Irish mob in depression era Chicago.  When his son, Michael Jr., witnesses a murder he becomes a liability, one that John Rooney, Michael's boss, can't allow.  When Michael's wife and youngest son are murdered at the hands of his `family' Michael and his Michael Jr. travel down the road of revenge, vowing to set matters straight.But it is far from an easy journey.Emotionally, `Road to Perdition' has a lot going for it.  It is a film bent on exploiting the contradictions between the life of a mobster and the life of a father.  Michael Sullivan is a man going to hell, but his only desire is that his son makes it to heaven.  While it seems like a simple enough morale, the way in which Mendes transfers it is deeply moving.But the film, above all else, is a technical marvel.`Road to Perdition' is visually stunning, a sublime directorial piece by Mendes.  It reminds me a lot of his recent `Revolutionary Road' in the way he was able to really connect with the era, not just the story.  Everything is so clean and so authentic; from the cars to the d&eacute;cor of the homes to the look of the skin on the man you are staring at.  Everything about this film lives and breathes the era Mendes was attempting to capture.  The score and the glorious set pieces also help in that regard.  Another testament to Mendes's impressive direction is the performances he gets from the ENTIRE cast.  This is one of the strongest ensembles of the year, for each and every player, no matter how small, adds so much to their scenes.  One that is truly impressive is Hanks, who I am vocally NOT a fan of.  What I really appreciated about his performance was the way he very slowly came out of his dark shell.  It was such a realistic and ultimately heartbreaking transition because we saw him become a father for the first time.  This had a lot to do, I'm sure, with Mendes's instructions, and his pacing of the film (while some may find it slow) truly helped establish this man's emotional journey.Hanks is not the only star here though, as I mentioned, everyone is great.  Paul Newman is the films standout, without question.  His paternal conflictions are so reaching and so moving, especially as the film draws to a close.  Jude Law is a horrific mental image who never fades away (giving me chills right now) and Daniel Craig took advantage of his personal charm in creating an arrogant child in a man's body.  Even bit parts like Stanley Tucci's or Jennifer Jason Leigh's or Anthony LaPaglia (who was cut from the film only to make his way back if you catch the right `version') are all spot on.Like I mentioned, this is no `Miller's Crossing'.  The film, while great and far better than Scorsese's overhyped disaster, is not perfect.  I personally did not like the subplot involving the bank robberies and actually found the bizarre approach to those scenes almost off-putting.  They construed the eerie vibe the film was maintaining by trying too hard to insert a comedic edge.  Thankfully it was short-lived, but it is there and that upsets me.  I actually could have gone with a little more length in the film as well; maybe a few more scenes fleshing out the relationship budding between father and son.  I think that it would have aided the film in comparing the relationship between Michael and his son with the relationship between Michael and Rooney, who was obviously a father figure.The film is still stunning in many areas and a very, very engrossing and entertaining film.  I highly recommend this to any fan of the genre or the actors or the director (I am really impressed with his small yet diversified resume), for they are all at the top of their games.",4,A road well worth traveling...,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,4367,"['feel', 'really', 'sad', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'guess', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'won', 'Directing', 'Oscar', 'first', 'shot', 'box', '1999', 'particular', 'case', 'feel', 'really', 'bad', 'Much', 'Coen', 'brothers', '1990', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'made', 'wonderful', 'Gangster', 'movie', 'was', 'trampled', 'over', 'inferior', 'one', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Sure', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'Miller', 'Crossing', 'masterpiece', 'then', 'again', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'far', 'GoodFellas', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'much', 'more', 'controlled', 'complete', 'enjoyable', 'scattered', 'mess', 'Scorsese', 'campaigned', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'strong', 'arm', 'Irish', 'mob', 'depression', 'era', 'Chicago', 'When', 'son', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'murder', 'liability', 'one', 'John', 'Rooney', 'Michael', 'boss', 'ca', ""n't"", 'allow', 'When', 'Michael', 'wife', 'youngest', 'son', 'are', 'murdered', 'hands', 'family', 'Michael', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'travel', 'road', 'revenge', 'vowing', 'set', 'matters', 'straight.But', 'far', 'easy', 'journey.Emotionally', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'lot', 'going', 'film', 'bent', 'exploiting', 'contradictions', 'life', 'mobster', 'life', 'father', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'man', 'going', 'hell', 'only', 'desire', 'son', 'heaven', 'simple', 'enough', 'morale', 'way', 'Mendes', 'transfers', 'deeply', 'moving.But', 'film', 'else', 'technical', 'marvel.', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'visually', 'stunning', 'sublime', 'directorial', 'piece', 'Mendes', 'lot', 'recent', 'Revolutionary', 'Road', 'way', 'was', 'able', 'really', 'connect', 'era', 'not', 'just', 'story', 'Everything', 'so', 'clean', 'so', 'authentic', 'cars', 'd', 'eacute', 'cor', 'homes', 'look', 'skin', 'man', 'are', 'staring', 'Everything', 'film', 'era', 'Mendes', 'was', 'attempting', 'capture', 'score', 'glorious', 'set', 'pieces', 'also', 'help', 'regard', 'testament', 'Mendes', 'impressive', 'direction', 'performances', 'ENTIRE', 'cast', 'one', 'strongest', 'ensembles', 'year', 'player', 'matter', 'how', 'small', 'so', 'much', 'scenes', 'One', 'truly', 'impressive', 'Hanks', 'who', 'am', 'vocally', 'NOT', 'fan', 'What', 'really', 'appreciated', 'performance', 'was', 'way', 'very', 'slowly', 'came', 'dark', 'shell', 'was', 'such', 'realistic', 'ultimately', 'heartbreaking', 'transition', 'saw', 'become', 'father', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'lot', 'do', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Mendes', 'instructions', 'pacing', 'film', 'may', 'find', 'slow', 'truly', 'helped', 'establish', 'man', 'emotional', 'journey.Hanks', 'not', 'only', 'star', 'here', 'though', 'mentioned', 'everyone', 'great', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'films', 'standout', 'question', 'paternal', 'conflictions', 'are', 'so', 'reaching', 'so', 'moving', 'especially', 'film', 'close', 'Jude', 'Law', 'horrific', 'mental', 'image', 'who', 'never', 'away', 'giving', 'chills', 'right', 'now', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'took', 'advantage', 'personal', 'charm', 'creating', 'arrogant', 'child', 'man', 'body', 'Even', 'bit', 'parts', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'who', 'was', 'cut', 'film', 'only', 'make', 'way', 'back', 'catch', 'right', 'version', 'are', 'spot', 'mentioned', 'Miller', 'Crossing', 'film', 'great', 'far', 'better', 'Scorsese', 'overhyped', 'disaster', 'not', 'perfect', 'personally', 'did', 'not', 'subplot', 'involving', 'bank', 'robberies', 'actually', 'found', 'bizarre', 'approach', 'scenes', 'almost', 'off-putting', 'construed', 'eerie', 'film', 'was', 'maintaining', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'insert', 'comedic', 'edge', 'Thankfully', 'was', 'short-lived', 'there', 'upsets', 'actually', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'little', 'more', 'length', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'maybe', 'few', 'more', 'scenes', 'fleshing', 'out', 'relationship', 'budding', 'father', 'son', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'aided', 'film', 'comparing', 'relationship', 'Michael', 'son', 'relationship', 'Michael', 'Rooney', 'who', 'was', 'obviously', 'father', 'figure.The', 'film', 'still', 'stunning', 'many', 'areas', 'very', 'very', 'engrossing', 'entertaining', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fan', 'genre', 'actors', 'director', 'am', 'really', 'impressed', 'small', 'yet', 'diversified', 'resume', 'are', 'top', 'games']",N/A
597758,A3JCW6YA3C6Z6S,B00005JLBQ,Andrew Mendelssohn,"[4, 6]","Tom Hanks plays a mob enforcer for Paul Newman's mob boss character in 1930's Illinios.  Hanks is both a family man and a killer, but when his son accidentally witnesses a murder Hanks must flee with the boy....  well, to say anything else would be to spoil the film.Hanks character develops slowly and quietly.  He is a man of few words, and Hanks gives real depth to what could otherwise have been a flat personality.  Indeed, I have one small complaint that perhaps Hanks gave the man too much depth...  except for his love for his family he isn't a great guy, and I didn't feel that he ever really made a moral connection between his chosen life and its consequences.  He loves his family and saves his son, and via this we see the man has a real soul despite being a killer.  At a few occasions Hanks just seemed too nice for the part!Newman is quite effective as the mob boss, and his dialog has the real moral lesson of the film.  In some ways, despite never reforming Newman is more aware of the consequences and costs of the mob life than Hank's character ever seems to be, and he gives his character real depth.  Jude Law is great as an exceptionally creepy supporting character!As for the dvd, video quality was quite good.  The film is dark at times but colors and contrast never really suffer.  I was really surprised by the Dolby 5.0 soundtrack.  I have a full home theater system and this disk's audio really shone.  The occasional gun fight made full use of the rears and shots seemed to shoot around the room.

In this movie, it is also the name of a small Illinois town.  Or is it both?Michael Sullivan, Jr. opens the movie by telling the audience that some people said his dad was a decent person and some said there was no good in him at all.  He then says he spent six weeks with him in the summer of 1931 and this is their story.  Thus begins a dark, often touching, often disturbing movie about the Irish Mafia in depression-era Chicago.Tom Hanks is outstanding as Michael Sullivan, the father, a hit man for mob boss John Rooney, played by Paul Newman.  A very different role for Hanks, but one he imbues with his talent so well this ""good guy"" is extremely believable as the ""bad guy"" for a change.  All is going well until his son secretly goes along on a mission one night and witnesses Sullivan making a hit.  And now the kid's life is in danger.  His father appeals to the mob boss to spare him and is assured such will be the case.  But when Michael Sullivan arrives home one night, a double murder assures him his life and his son's are marked.  So begins their six-week journey to find safety at his sister's home in Perdition.The cinematography is outstanding in this darkly photographed movie where there is more rain than we've had since ""Angela's Ashes.""  The costuming, the casting, the story are all flawless but it is Hanks, playing the cold-hearted killer who is also a loving father, who lifts this above the rest of the summer movie fare.You won't get the action or dazzling glamour of ""The Godfather"" but you will get a good film noir movie that showcases Hanks, gives outstanding scenes to Newman, and tells a story that keeps you riveted to the screen.",4,Emotionally-Charged Mafia Movie Showcases Hanks,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,1790,"['look', 'word', 'perdition', 'up', 'dictionary', 'will', 'see', 'loss', 'soul', 'eternal', 'damnation', 'movie', 'also', 'name', 'small', 'Illinois', 'town', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Jr.', 'movie', 'telling', 'audience', 'people', 'said', 'dad', 'was', 'decent', 'person', 'said', 'was', 'good', 'then', 'spent', 'six', 'weeks', 'summer', '1931', 'story', 'Thus', 'dark', 'often', 'touching', 'often', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'Irish', 'Mafia', 'depression-era', 'Chicago.Tom', 'Hanks', 'outstanding', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'father', 'hit', 'man', 'mob', 'boss', 'John', 'Rooney', 'played', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'very', 'different', 'role', 'Hanks', 'one', 'talent', 'so', 'well', 'good', 'guy', 'extremely', 'believable', 'bad', 'guy', 'change', 'going', 'well', 'son', 'secretly', 'along', 'mission', 'one', 'night', 'witnesses', 'Sullivan', 'making', 'hit', 'now', 'kid', 'life', 'danger', 'father', 'appeals', 'mob', 'boss', 'spare', 'assured', 'such', 'will', 'be', 'case', 'when', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'home', 'one', 'night', 'double', 'murder', 'life', 'son', 'are', 'marked', 'So', 'six-week', 'journey', 'find', 'safety', 'sister', 'home', 'Perdition.The', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'darkly', 'photographed', 'movie', 'where', 'more', 'rain', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Angela', 'Ashes', 'costuming', 'casting', 'story', 'are', 'flawless', 'Hanks', 'playing', 'cold-hearted', 'killer', 'who', 'also', 'loving', 'father', 'who', 'rest', 'summer', 'movie', 'fare.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'action', 'dazzling', 'glamour', 'Godfather', 'will', 'get', 'good', 'film', 'noir', 'movie', 'Hanks', 'outstanding', 'scenes', 'Newman', 'story', 'riveted', 'screen']",N/A

A dream cast, literally flawless down to the smallest part, tells a tragic tale of loyalties betrayed and of bonds broken and bonds established.  Conrad Hall's cinematography is casually stunning and every production detail is  meticulous and authentic.  The past is captured with intelligence and care.Sam Mendes has found a way to tell this tale of violence and murder with great style and grace.  His choices throughout the film are brilliant, whether in unexpected closeups or thoughtful and unusual camera placement and angles. The use of weather (rain) and locale and the look & tone of the piece are marvelous. None of his work is forced and it flows and melds nicely.  With this, only his second film, he has established his place in the forefront of today's filmakers.  Truly remarkable work!I will not give the details of the story other than it involves Irish mobsters who are affiliated with Al Capone in Chicago, and how things go terribly wrong when a son discovers his father's (Tom Hanks) business. An aging mob boss (Paul Newman) must make the terrible choice between a baseless son and his adopted son whom he truly loves..  Their world is turned upside down and a quest for survival becomes a quest for redemption as well.As I said at the outset the cast is superb: Tom Hanks is completely believable in a different, darker role than we have seen him play before.  Paul Newman nails the contradictions in this charming but deadly old gangster.  Jude Law is spot-on as an amoral hitman.  And Daniel Craig makes an impression as the envious son with the constant smile but no laughter in his eyes.  Stanley Tucci does a nice small part and all the minor characters are fine.  But, the great work are the scenes between Newman & Hanks and Hanks and Hoechlin.  Fathers & sons and the mysteries & contradictions always inherent in those relationships.Thanks to Dreamworks and the producers for, again, releasing a serious film for adults in the Summer.  A welcome relief from the hyper noisy and busy popcorn movie season.This is as fine a piece of filmmaking as you're likely to see in a while.  First rate in all departments.

I have been looking forward to its release...and was not disappointed when I saw it last weekend.Hanks is so different in this movie.  More reserved, subtle, and allows other actors, esp. his son, to share in the limelight.  He plays a hitman, and acts as one.  Another great performance to put on his resume.As for the rest of the movie, it's a lot darker and more violent than I ever would have expected.  This is a revenge movie, so that must be understood.  With the beautiful scenery and wardrobes, I was unconsciously comparing it to The Untouchables throughout.  Mendes does a great job directing, and has already established himself to be a director worth watching.  A Newsweek article complained that this movie was trying to hard.  Rubbish.  It's simply Hanks and Mendes collaborating on a gangster movie with dark undertones.  Newman is also great in it, as is Jude Law (in by far his creepiest role) and the sons, Newman's and Hank's.

It's made an affect on you, therefore it is moving; it is powerful, and you can't deny it.  You've felt it and experienced it.If a movie can make you feel, if it can make you physically express that emotional in which it brings out in you, it is moving; it is powerful.  You will probably never forget how its made you feel.But if a movie can do both, it's more than just some flick you caught in the theatre or rented or even one that you've bought.  It's a part of you and it is undeniable.  Only a few movies you will ever see in your life will do this to you...if any.  But Road to Perdition has managed to affect me in both ways.  This is a movie about the life of gangsters, in a way, but what this movie really is about is the relationship between fathers and sons.  Blood or no blood, it's the bond the two men have together.  That's what this movie is all about.  I'm not going to tell you anything about it, I feel that it's up to the people who watch it to let the plot and meaning unravel for yourself and let your feelings and thoughts do the rest.  But I will say that all the actors, Tom Hanks and Paul Newman especially, did an excellent job.  The story is amazing, the directing is topnotch, the cinematography is wonderful.  This movie has the ability to question parts of you that you're afraid to, but also soothes the parts of you that can feel empty or scared.  Road to Perdition can't really be called a movie.

It shows, overall, that at the heart of every mob movie, there is a heart. Though masterfully directed by American Beauty director Sam Mendes, with stunning visuals and an intellegent script, ""Road to Perdition"" fails on a few levels, which keeps it from being the masterpiece it might have been.Tom Hanks plays a family man who belongs to two different families, his wife and kids, and as a hitman for his ""father"" (Paul Newman) who is the patriarch of a poweful mob family. Things get heated when his 12 year old son witnesses a hit gone wrong, and a contract is put out on Hanks and his family. They embark on a road trip to escape the mob, save their lives, and start someting new. Hanks's motivation is at the heart of this movie- he doesn't want his son to wind up like him.While this is definitely a great idea on paper, it somewhat suffers in the execution. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, leaving little to sympathize with. The mob family loyalty was not played on as strongly as it could, and the drama was lukewarm at best, relying more on gun battles than character development. Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are excellent actors, but their performances here cannot be considered career highlights. Hanks in particular plays a wooden character, and his performance strikes me as a man who would rather be doing something else. The only real standout performance is from Jude Law, who plays a creepy hitman with a morbid obsession for photographing his victims. While I liked the idea, the movie is altogether unsatisfying, for the sole reason that it could have been so much better.The movie might not be a masterpiece, but the Commentary on the DVD is worth the price of admission. Sam Mendes gives some fun and intellegent insight into the movie, how it was made, and gives plenty of interesting anecdotes along the way. The deleted scenes are nothing special, but the ""Making of"" documentary is enjoyable enough. If you liked the movie, the DVD is a nice companion.While this is far from a bad film, it simply doesn't live up to it's potential. It is perhaps this reason why it didn't get much attention at the Oscars. For some, this is a good twist on the classic mob story, but next time I am in the mood I'll grab my copy of ""The Godfather"" instead.",3,"Good on paper, lackluster on film.",1052006400,"05 4, 2003",2003,2372,"['seemengly', 'endless', 'parade', 'mob', 'movies', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'out', 'most', 'moralistic', 'overall', 'heart', 'mob', 'movie', 'heart', 'masterfully', 'directed', 'American', 'Beauty', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'intellegent', 'script', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'few', 'levels', 'being', 'masterpiece', 'might', 'have', 'been.Tom', 'Hanks', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'two', 'different', 'families', 'wife', 'kids', 'hitman', 'father', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'who', 'patriarch', 'poweful', 'mob', 'family', 'Things', 'get', 'heated', 'when', '12', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'hit', 'gone', 'wrong', 'contract', 'put', 'out', 'Hanks', 'family', 'embark', 'road', 'trip', 'escape', 'mob', 'save', 'lives', 'start', 'someting', 'new', 'Hanks', 'motivation', 'heart', 'movie-', ""n't"", 'want', 'son', 'wind', 'up', 'him.While', 'definitely', 'great', 'idea', 'paper', 'suffers', 'execution', 'characters', 'are', 'sadly', 'underdeveloped', 'leaving', 'little', 'sympathize', 'mob', 'family', 'loyalty', 'was', 'not', 'played', 'as', 'strongly', 'could', 'drama', 'was', 'lukewarm', 'best', 'relying', 'more', 'gun', 'battles', 'character', 'development', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'are', 'excellent', 'actors', 'performances', 'here', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'career', 'highlights', 'Hanks', 'particular', 'plays', 'wooden', 'character', 'performance', 'strikes', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'only', 'real', 'standout', 'performance', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'creepy', 'hitman', 'morbid', 'obsession', 'photographing', 'victims', 'liked', 'idea', 'movie', 'altogether', 'unsatisfying', 'sole', 'reason', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better.The', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'Commentary', 'DVD', 'price', 'admission', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'fun', 'intellegent', 'insight', 'movie', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'anecdotes', 'way', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'nothing', 'special', 'Making', 'documentary', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'liked', 'movie', 'DVD', 'nice', 'companion.While', 'far', 'bad', 'film', 'simply', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'perhaps', 'reason', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'attention', 'Oscars', 'good', 'twist', 'classic', 'mob', 'story', 'next', 'time', 'am', 'mood', ""'ll"", 'grab', 'copy', 'Godfather', 'instead']",N/A

Where American Beauty really had no characters that were compelling and all of them seemed to be caricatures straight from Hollywood's neurotic suburbia playbook,  Road To Perdition brings us into the world of complex people driven by honor, duty and filial love to do things that ordinarily they would never think of doing.The plot centers around a hitman, Michael Sullivan (played by Tom Hanks) who's son views him while doing his work.  He believes that his son won't snitch, and his boss (Paul Newman) seems to agree.  However, the boss' weak son Connor tries to silence the witness by killing Sullivan's wife and younger son and having a club owner kill Michael Sullivan.  Things go wrong and Sullivan and his son Michael Jr. escape and are sent on an oddssey of revenge and, strangely enough, self-discovery.The vocation of Michael Sullivan provides an interesting and subversive twist on the old father/son bonding motif.  There are also great moments of genuine warmth and humor woven in between the violence and action.  The ending is a suprise and is more thoughtful and intelligent than I expected.The best parts of Road to Perdition are: the performances by Hanks and Newman, the cinematography and costumes.  Hanks and Newman perfect the roles they have and literally become the characters and look as if the family troubles that form the backbone of the story are written on their faces and in all of their movements.  The cinematography and the costumes/sets are, quite simply, amazing.

Sam Mendes' sophomore feature film effort isn't quite as expensive or unsatisfying as Michael Camino's junior effort, Heaven's Gate, but it comes close. This is the problem of, pardon the expression, shooting your wad too soon. Where to start?Miscasting: Daniel Craig being the only exception. How can you waste Jennifer Jsson Leigh in a bit part? Barely a bit part! Just because an actor can handle a part it doesn't mean you can or should cast them in the part. Newman was extraordinarily perfect (yes I know the problem with that) as Sid Mussburger in The Hudsucker Proxy. That's casting genius. This is casting by numbers. Tom Hanks, Jude Law and Tyler Hoechlin were just plain wrong. That's not even casting by the numbers. You've got to know your box office.Intentions: Seems as if Mendes wanted to make something to compare with The Godfather Saga and, IMHO the superior, Miller's Crossing. In the way both of those had inimitable style, Mendes tried, unsuccessfully, to create one for his saga. He would have been better off playing it straight and not strayed from the already meticulous representation given to the period. The scenes of violence were so arty that they lacked impact and didn't bring-it-home, so to speak.Raw Material: Frankly, I didn't care for the story. It didn't run in a logical manner and seem to plod along without a lot of reason. I'm not going to drag it out but one example would be sending Sullivan to Calvino with a note rather than using the phone and sending him with a blank note. Of course, using that kind of logic and your movie is over in ten minutes but that what separates the mediocre from the best, being able to use good or even great logic and make a feature film.There's a lot more but I'm going to say just one more thing and that is I'm a great one for endings and this is one is flat.

Tom Hanks, as Michael Sullivan, takes on a tricky role.  He must be sympathetic, but not too sympathetic: a cold-blooded killer who would sacrifice everything for his family.  As expected, Hanks pulls it off beautifully. The acting is solid throughout.  Paul Newman is brilliant as an older version of Sullivan-too bad he didn't get more screen time to plumb the depths of his agonizingly conflicted, brutal yet tender character.  Daniel Craig, as Newman's thoroughly rotten son, makes you want to jump out of your seat and murder him yourself.  And, I could watch Stanley Tucci play Frank Nitti all day.  The only problem for me was Jude Law's character: despite Law's solid performance, Maguire seems awfully contrived and stylized for a film otherwise stripped of frills and grimly realistic.

597778,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B00005JLBQ,Brian Driver,"[2, 2]","This is a stunning movie of unusual power and grace, an intelligent minimalist movie made once again from the ranks of one of our fastest rising art forms: Graphic Novels.  These novels are fast rising into the mainstream of our culture, and it should not be long before they are accepted by more than filmmakers and fans of ""picture novels."" The graphic novels of the same name was written by Max Collins and Richard Piers Rayner over several years in the 1990s.Director Sam Mendes (Skyfall) has directed a somber, quiet movie out of muted color and performance, stripping the actors of ornate dialogue and lush scenery in order to drive home the movie's stark seriousness. Though on one hand the movie could be said to feature mobsters and assassins and death and honor and revenge, it could be stripped down even further into this simple statement: it's about fathers and sons, and the relationships between them.Tom Hanks is Michael Sullivan, an assassin/enforcer for mobster John Rooney (Paul Newman), who adopted him when he was orphaned. Though Conner Rooney (Daniel Craig) is the biological son of the elder Rooney, it is not stretching things to suggest that Rooney cares more for Michael than Connor, who is a lout. When an unhappy member of the gang whose loyalties are being questioned annoys him, Connor kills him in a fit of mindless anger, resulting in Michael's having to shoot down the man's bodyguards.  Worse, Michael's son (played by Tyler Hoechlin) has smuggled himself along in his father's car to see what it is his taciturn daddy does, and the two adults see him. Though Michael secures his own son's sincere promise to be silent, Connor once again reacts stupidly and attempts to murder Michael's whole family in cold blood. He half succeeds, killing Michael's wife and youngest son, but his other son Michael Jr. escapes, and the ambush he sets up for Michael fails.When Rooney finds out he is left with one choice: support his adopted son, or support his real son...and flesh and blood wins out, to his own chagrin. Though he hates his son for his actions, he cannot give him up, and doing so costs him the adopted son he loves, and admires. He's in a no-win situation.Since he has now sworn to get vengeance, Michael is forced to go on the run, and Rooney is forced to hire assassin Harlan Maguire (Jude Law). In order to hurt his boss, and force Capone's hand as an overseer of his mob ""family,"" Michael decides to steal from the secret accounts he knows are in banks throughout Illinois. So he and his son drive around the countryside, trying to avoid being assassinated while doing what daddy had tried so hard to avoid telling his son he did.As one might guess from the pedigree of the cast AND its director, who had just come from his multi-Oscar-winning AMERICAN BEAUTY, with Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, this is a movie of stunning power combined with restraint. As it takes place in an Illinois winter, during the depression, most of the exterior shots are cloaked in white or earth tones, and even the interior sets are muted in wood grain and darkness. Dialogue is sparing, and when it occurs it serves as an effect in and of himself...such as when Jude Law's bizarre character takes the stage. He is a scene stealer: a sick murderer who loves to photograph his kills...even if they aren't quite dead yet. He loves to talk, to gab, and his banter belies his sinister, perverse nature. And in one terrific scene, when he is injured by exploding glass, he carries with him a glittering, permanent mark of his true iniquity.Yes, Law stands out; but truly all the actors are marvelous.  Newman of course is outstanding, but when is he not? Tom Hanks is a true surprise, though he'd played dramatic roles before inPhiladelphiaandForrest Gump, he had not ever played a disagreeable, ultimately evil man...a killer.  But he carries himself with gravitas, his face a permanent scowl that seems to condense a killer's life into the heavy eyes of a man condemned to hell, knowing he had now dragged his son into the fray. And another surprise performance is Daniel Craig's, whose Connor Sullivan is a masterwork of creepiness, a whiny, complaining loser who cries out for independence while hiding under his father's coattails, a boy in a man's suit.  Who knew this future Bond could play such a sinister, loathsome bastard - and before you object, I'm using that word in its metaphorical manner, describing a person who is in a very real sense NOT the true son of his father.One interesting fact I read concerned Tom Hanks, who asked Mendes to make sure to reduce the violence in the movie...to make sure any scenes with violence in them were there for a distinct reason. His wish must have been carried out, because the violence within this movie is strategic and quite effective, and I certainly believe it could have been much, much more gratuitous. There is one amazing scene that is quite important in the film, an extremely violent scene in which many people die, yet it is accomplished SILENTLY...even the music is muted, and the effect is unique, even ghostly. It is an interesting choice: well-considered, and highly effective.See ROAD TO PERDITION if you're interested in a thoroughly engrossing, serious, thoughtful movie, one of lasting significance.

Set back into the 30's, Michael Sullivan(Tom Hanks) is a cold blooded murderer, hitman, but also a loving father and loyal husband.

So I went.  Boy, am I glad I did!  First, this is the most artistically rendered gangster film I've ever seen.  There is one scene of gangsters being machine gunned to death out in the rain that is absolutely magnificent, for example. You don't hear the sound of the gun at all but see its flash instead from deep within the shadows of the rainy night.  The whole movie is like this, including an off camera rendering of grief (finding a wife and child gunned down). The theme is fathers and their sons, where fathers may lead their sons and how that can come back to haunt them.  Paul Newman is the head gangster, Rooney, with a son, Connor, that it would be tame to describe as ""good for nothing.""  Rooney is used to making excuses for Connor though and that is the genesis of the conflict at the core of the movie.  Hanks' Mike Sullivan is a father too.  One of his sons is killed by Connor and he's forced to go on the lam with his other son, Michael.  I was not a Tom Hanks fan in his younger days but I like the job he is doing on these middle-aged characters who have more complexity.  He does a fine job.  The boy who plays his son does a terrific job too.

597785,AEVNUEDRGTC4P,B00005JLBQ,Charles J. Rector,"[1, 4]","Road to Perdition is a pretty stiff flick.  It aspires to be an art house picture complete with pretentious cinematography.  It features a criminal father who tries to teach his son all the usual important life lessons that so many movies also teach.Road to Perdition is based on a ""graphic novel"" that is synonymous for a comic book that is expensive, long, pretentious and done in black and white.  This particular work purports to be based on real people, but in reality, the only things real about it is the names of the characters and the names of the places that it is set in.  Otherwise, both the original graphic novel and the movie that is based on it have zero connection to real history.Road to Perdition has the kind of illogical plotting, numerous murders, lack of real women, goofy psychology and a general lack of insight that so many other Hollywood crime flicks have.  Basically, this movie is an exercise in absurdity.For instance, in order to get a shot at the man who murdered most of his family, the killer hero (Tom Hanks) decides to try to force the Chicago mob of Al Capone to release the man by stealing from Capone.  In real life, Al Capone always struck back at those who stole from him.  He never negotiated with those who sought to torment him.  The real Capone would have made short work of Hanks's character.There are other unrealistic elements to Road to Perdition.  Real life gang killers are a hard drinking, hard living lot who beat their women and pay cold shrift to their children.  Tom Hanks's killer is a quiet, solemn man who is a devoted family man.  A real life serial killer would never, ever apologize to his nine year old son for missing his school concert.  Also, Jude Law's killer reporter character who kills people and then takes their photographs and sells them to newspapers is a villain who much better would fit in a Batman type movie than in the oh so realistic Road to Perdition.All in all, Road to Perdition is just another Hollywood crime flick.",3,Average Crime Comic Book Flick,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,2002,"['Road', 'Perdition', 'pretty', 'stiff', 'flick', 'be', 'art', 'house', 'picture', 'complete', 'pretentious', 'cinematography', 'criminal', 'father', 'who', 'teach', 'son', 'usual', 'important', 'life', 'lessons', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'also', 'teach.Road', 'Perdition', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'synonymous', 'comic', 'book', 'expensive', 'long', 'pretentious', 'done', 'black', 'white', 'particular', 'work', 'purports', 'be', 'based', 'real', 'people', 'reality', 'only', 'things', 'real', 'names', 'characters', 'names', 'places', 'set', 'Otherwise', 'both', 'original', 'graphic', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'have', 'zero', 'connection', 'real', 'history.Road', 'Perdition', 'kind', 'illogical', 'plotting', 'numerous', 'murders', 'lack', 'real', 'women', 'goofy', 'psychology', 'general', 'lack', 'insight', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'crime', 'flicks', 'have', 'Basically', 'movie', 'exercise', 'absurdity.For', 'instance', 'order', 'get', 'shot', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'most', 'family', 'killer', 'hero', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'try', 'force', 'Chicago', 'mob', 'Al', 'Capone', 'release', 'man', 'stealing', 'Capone', 'real', 'life', 'Al', 'Capone', 'always', 'struck', 'back', 'who', 'stole', 'never', 'negotiated', 'who', 'sought', 'torment', 'real', 'Capone', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'short', 'work', 'Hanks', 'character.There', 'are', 'other', 'unrealistic', 'elements', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'Real', 'life', 'gang', 'killers', 'are', 'hard', 'drinking', 'hard', 'living', 'lot', 'who', 'beat', 'women', 'pay', 'cold', 'shrift', 'children', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'killer', 'quiet', 'solemn', 'man', 'who', 'devoted', 'family', 'man', 'real', 'life', 'serial', 'killer', 'would', 'never', 'ever', 'apologize', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'missing', 'school', 'concert', 'Also', 'Jude', 'Law', 'killer', 'reporter', 'character', 'who', 'people', 'then', 'photographs', 'newspapers', 'villain', 'who', 'much', 'better', 'would', 'fit', 'Batman', 'type', 'movie', 'oh', 'so', 'realistic', 'Road', 'Perdition.All', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'crime', 'flick']",N/A

597787,AKVU4HUG6AN1U,B00005JLBQ,"""chick_flick""","[2, 2]","""Road to Perdition"" is a groundbreaking film directed by Sam Mendes and starring a multi-talented, A-list essemble of actors. I must admit that I am probably one of the very few females who actually enjoyed this, considering I'm seeing many negative reviews coming from females. Maybe I am just the oddball of the bunch. By the way, I pre-ordered a copy of this DVD online without even seeing it previously in theaters; I rarely ever do that. I had wanted to go to the theaters and see it, but I had missed it and decided to pre-order a copy anyway, just because of all the raved reviews from critics and other people who saw it. I'm glad to say that I made a wise choice.PLOT SUMMARY: Tom Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, a hitman of the early 1930's who's life is turned upside down when the oldest of his two sons, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechin), follows him on one of his ""job missions"" and discovers that his father's boss, Mr. Rooney's (Paul Newman), son had murdered a man. Michael Jr. is forced to keep this incident a secret, but both father Michael and son's lives are at stake when someone from Mr. Rooney's mob murders Michael's wife, Annie Sullivan (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and his younger son, Peter (Liam Aiken), when the murderer thinks he was killing Michael Jr. Now, Michael must keep his son from ""taking the road to perdition"" and they are off on a long journey to try and get away from Mr. Rooney and his mob. However, Mr. Rooney has a mysterious man called Maguire (Jude Law), who must track Michael and his son down to kill them. As ironic as it is, Mr. Rooney has been like a father figure to Michael for many years, and appears to love him even more than his own son, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig), who becomes bitter with jealousy of Michael Sullivan and plots his own revenge.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: First of all, the acting was mezmorising and all of the actors had great chemistry. Who knew Tom Hanks could play ""the bad guy"" and make it look natural and flawless? Paul Newman is amazing as usual, and Jude Law was wonderful in a smaller role. The supporting cast, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Daniel Craig, Liam Aiken, etc. all did great jobs as well. Hence, I think the real star of this film is Tyler Hoechin, a young unknown actor who brilliantly portrayed the tough role of Michael Jr. He was the one that needed to bring the film together, since the story is seen from Michael Jr.'s eyes, and he did a superb job. I hope to see Hoechin in future films. The dialouge and storyline were amazing. Sam Mendes did a terrific directing job. The cinematography, sets, costumes, sound, and original musicical score are all stunning and absolutely gorgeous. And when you think, ""Oh--it's always raining, snowing, or it's nighttime in this film!"", well that's because those weather elements help to show the emotions of the film. In my opinion, ""Road to Perdition"" is one of the best films of the year! There is no real flaw to it, except that it's a bit slow-paced, but you're so engrossed into the film that you hardly notice the time flying by.The question is: Is ""Road to Perdition"" for everyone? Well, it all depends. If you like mob films, then this is definitely for you. Also, if you like a film where father/son must struggle with their relationship, then you will probably enjoy it...at least the family element of the story. If you care for neither, then most likely, you should skip this unless you are a diehard fan of one of the actors in the film. Then you might want to check this out for their performance. But ""Road to Perdition"" is definitely a powerful film. It's a real ""art-y film"" and an ""actor's film"".The DVD is OK, with some good, normal bonus features like deleted scenes, an HBO presentation on the making of ""Road to Perdition"", a commentary track with Sam Mendes, production notes, and a photo gallery. It is available in both wide screen and full frame formats.I highly recommend ""Road to Perdition"".Score:100/100A+",5,"The long, dark road to Hell.",1047168000,"03 9, 2003",2003,3956,"['Road', 'Perdition', 'groundbreaking', 'film', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'starring', 'multi-talented', 'A-list', 'essemble', 'actors', 'must', 'admit', 'am', 'probably', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'females', 'who', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'considering', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'coming', 'females', 'Maybe', 'am', 'just', 'oddball', 'bunch', 'way', 'pre-ordered', 'copy', 'DVD', 'online', 'even', 'seeing', 'previously', 'theaters', 'rarely', 'ever', 'do', 'had', 'wanted', 'go', 'theaters', 'see', 'had', 'missed', 'decided', 'pre-order', 'copy', 'anyway', 'just', 'raved', 'reviews', 'critics', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'saw', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'made', 'wise', 'choice.PLOT', 'SUMMARY', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'hitman', 'early', '1930', 'who', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'oldest', 'two', 'sons', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'Tyler', 'Hoechin', 'one', 'job', 'missions', 'discovers', 'father', 'boss', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'son', 'had', 'murdered', 'man', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'forced', 'keep', 'incident', 'secret', 'father', 'Michael', 'son', 'lives', 'are', 'stake', 'when', 'someone', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'mob', 'murders', 'Michael', 'wife', 'Annie', 'Sullivan', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'younger', 'son', 'Peter', 'Liam', 'Aiken', 'when', 'murderer', 'was', 'killing', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'Now', 'Michael', 'must', 'keep', 'son', 'taking', 'road', 'perdition', 'are', 'off', 'long', 'journey', 'try', 'get', 'away', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'mob', 'However', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'mysterious', 'man', 'called', 'Maguire', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'must', 'track', 'Michael', 'son', 'down', 'kill', 'As', 'ironic', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'been', 'father', 'figure', 'Michael', 'many', 'years', 'love', 'even', 'more', 'own', 'son', 'Connor', 'Rooney', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'bitter', 'jealousy', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'plots', 'own', 'revenge.MY', 'OVERALL', 'THOUGHTS', 'First', 'all', 'acting', 'was', 'mezmorising', 'actors', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Who', 'knew', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'could', 'play', 'bad', 'guy', 'make', 'look', 'natural', 'flawless', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'amazing', 'usual', 'Jude', 'Law', 'was', 'wonderful', 'smaller', 'role', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Liam', 'Aiken', 'etc', 'did', 'great', 'jobs', 'as', 'well', 'Hence', 'think', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'Tyler', 'Hoechin', 'young', 'unknown', 'actor', 'who', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'tough', 'role', 'Michael', 'Jr', 'was', 'one', 'needed', 'bring', 'film', 'together', 'story', 'seen', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'eyes', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'hope', 'see', 'Hoechin', 'future', 'films', 'dialouge', 'storyline', 'were', 'amazing', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'did', 'terrific', 'directing', 'job', 'cinematography', 'sets', 'costumes', 'sound', 'original', 'musicical', 'score', 'are', 'stunning', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'when', 'think', 'Oh', 'always', 'raining', 'snowing', 'nighttime', 'film', 'well', 'weather', 'elements', 'help', 'show', 'emotions', 'film', 'opinion', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'real', 'flaw', 'bit', 'slow-paced', ""'re"", 'so', 'engrossed', 'film', 'hardly', 'time', 'flying', 'by.The', 'question', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'everyone', 'Well', 'like', 'mob', 'films', 'then', 'definitely', 'Also', 'like', 'film', 'where', 'father/son', 'must', 'struggle', 'relationship', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'least', 'family', 'element', 'story', 'care', 'neither', 'then', 'most', 'likely', 'should', 'skip', 'are', 'diehard', 'fan', 'one', 'actors', 'film', 'Then', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'performance', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'definitely', 'powerful', 'film', 'real', 'art-y', 'film', 'actor', 'film', '.The', 'DVD', 'OK', 'good', 'normal', 'bonus', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'HBO', 'presentation', 'making', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'commentary', 'track', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'production', 'notes', 'photo', 'gallery', 'available', 'wide', 'screen', 'full', 'frame', 'formats.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Road', 'Perdition', '.Score:100/100A+']",N/A

This is a gangster movie going back to 1931.Hanks is Michael Sullivan, Sr.  He is married and the father of Peter and Michael, Jr.  The mobsters are Irish Catholic and live in and around Chicago in 1931 during Prohibition. Hanks works as an enforcer for his foster father, John Rooney (a raspy-voice Newman), an Illinois gangster affiliated with Al Capone.  This is how Michael Sullivan made a living and is Michael's way of paying back Mr. Rooney for all the good things he had done for him.  Michael always keep his profession a secret to his two sons, until one day Michael Jr sneaks in his dad's career and happens to witness a murder taking place.  When his dad's discovers he there, he begins to worry.  During the movie, Mr. Rooney's jealous biological son, Conner (Daniel Craig), rashly murders Michael's wife and youngest son, setting Michael on a course of revenge in the belief that his surrogate father has betrayed him.  Now Michael is outside his mob family's protection, on the road with his surviving 12-year-old son. Father and son, bound by sorrow and a sense of guilt, grow closer as they elude an assassin and put into effect a clever plan ...I think that it's worth being in anyone's VHS or DVD collection, unless you are very offended with violence.

Reilly,"[1, 2]","I read the Graphic Novel Road to Perdition by Max Allen Collins and Richard Piers Rayner when it was released by DC Comics' Paradox Press imprint years ago. To say I was blown away would be an understatement. This was one of the finest works of literature I have ever encountered. In any medium. PERIOD. It really distressed me that Collins and Rayner weren't getting money and awards heaped on them. No one seemed to have read it but me! Well, I guess it doesn't matter how many people read it after all, because apparently the RIGHT people read it, since it's now a big summer movie.Road to Perdition tells the story of Michael Sullivan, a mob button-man in prohibition-era Chicago, forced to go on the run with his young son, after the son sees Sullivan and Connor Rooney, the son of a powerful Mob-Boss (Wonderfully played  by the great Paul Newman, who will probably get an Oscar for his part), carrying out a mission that goes horribly wrong, due to the trigger-happy Conner.  The book and movie echo the classic Japanese Manga Lone Wolf and Cub, as father and son face incredible odds, leading to a fateful climax that will decide the boy's future. Jude Law is excellent as the Homicidal crime-scene photographer sent after the Sullivans, and Stanley Tucci does his usual great job as Frank Nitti. It's too bad that Anthony LaPaglia's Al Capone was left on the cutting room floor, as Capone's presence loomed large in the book.The adaptation, by David Self, veers WAAY off from the source material; The movie is much ""Smaller"" than the book, and omits the Capone Hotel massacre, the riverboat heist/fire, and changes the fate of young Michael to a more bland one. Overall, it's a very good movie, but as usual, the book was better.

Tom Hanks is excellent as the hitman on the run from his former employers.  Paul Newman, in the twilight of a great career, is even better as the mob boss.  The few scenes that Hanks and Newman share are pure cinematic dynamite.  Tyler Hoechlin as Hanks' young son is a natural.  Jude Law delivers another good character performance as the hired gun/free-lance photographer.  In smaller roles Daniel Craig, Dylan Baker, and Stanley Tucci also do good work.  The direction by Sam Mendes is crisp and the story moves pretty good.  The art direction and the cinematography are breathtaking.  I think ultimately why this film fails to achieve greatness is that at it's heart it is a cold one.

One is readily betrayed for reasons of greed and perceived self preservation. Tom Hanks portrays Michael Sullivan, a gangster possessing solidly Catholic middle-class family values.  Prayer and a sense of responsibility underpin his outlook on life.  He obviously hopes for religious salvation, but can such a man be saved from eternal damnation?  Sullivan is something of a stepson to Irish mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman).  He is also Rooney's number one enforcer and hit man. The latter has Sullivan accompany his son Connor (Daniel Craig) on a mission to calm down a distraught hoodlum whose brother has just been killed by Rooney's mobsters for allegedly stealing from the gang.  Things go wrong and a number of men have to be killed.  Unfortunately, Sullivan's older son Michael, Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) has witnessed the massacre and at least one person is afraid that the young boy might go to the police.  Connor murders Sullivan's wife and youngest son.  It's time to for the remaining two male family members to get out of town. The killing never ceases as both father and son travel throughout the midwest seeking revenge and safety.  Jude Law effectively plays the role of the vile contract killer chasing them.  Director Sam Mendes superbly brings us back to the year 1931 and the action is non-stop interspersed with riveting dialogue.  There are occasional lapses in logic, but the incredible acting of the cast members allows you to overlook these minor difficulties.  Stanley Tucci especially deserves special mention as the low keyed and soft spoken organized crime leader Frank Nitti.Hanks and Newman will almost certainly be remembered by this year's academy award nominating committee.  Road to Perdition is geared for an adult audience and easily earns five stars.

This is one of Hanks's best performances. In the first fifteen minutes of the movie he manages to do a considerable amount of outstanding acting without saying very much. It does it all in his expressions and in his eyes.Paul Newman is wonderful as the family patriach. The script is top notch with a compelling storyline. The movie has an excellent supporting cast that includes Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Jude Law, and Jennifer Jason Lee. The are two other stand out performances by theactor that portrays Paul Newman's ambicious and jealous(of Tom Hanks)son, and the young actor that portrays Tom Hank's oldest son.If you are a fan of movie cinema.

Friedman,"[5, 19]","The movie is beautifully shot, and, were I judging it based on the merits of its cinematography, would be inclined to give it five stars.Yet the movie fails utterly in its plot.  The movie is not intentionally trying to be Shakespearean, but it alludes to tragic failings anyway.  (Note: if you have not seen the movie, stop reading the review).  The movie ends with Tom Hanks' character (Paul Newman's killer-for-hire) being killed by Jude Law's character (another killer-for-hire).  Earlier in the film there was a shootout betwee these two, and, apaprently, Jude Law's character was not quite finished.This does not ring true.  I think the intent of the movie was to convey the idea that Tom Hanks' character was past his prime and did not attend to the simple detail of making sure that a target was really dead.  Or something like that.  In any event, this is not made clear, and it seems to me highly unlikely that a professionally trained assassin could be so careless as to shoot a target and then escape without making sure that the target was really dead.I left the theater with the feeling that a 'deep' message was supposed to be conveyed about the tragic failings of our hero (a la Lear or Hamlet).  But the effect was overwrought and not convincing.This plot development was entirely too coincidental and typical of Hollywood's obsession with the simple and immediately accessible that the more interesting aspects of the film (its cinematography, especially) do not receive the attention they deserve.",2,I don't buy the plot...,1066521600,"10 19, 2003",2003,1516,"['movie', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'were', 'judging', 'based', 'merits', 'cinematography', 'would', 'be', 'inclined', 'give', 'five', 'movie', 'utterly', 'plot', 'movie', 'not', 'intentionally', 'trying', 'be', 'Shakespearean', 'tragic', 'failings', 'anyway', 'Note', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'stop', 'reading', 'review', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'character', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'killer-for-hire', 'being', 'killed', 'Jude', 'Law', 'character', 'killer-for-hire', 'Earlier', 'film', 'was', 'shootout', 'two', 'apaprently', 'Jude', 'Law', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'finished.This', 'not', 'ring', 'true', 'think', 'intent', 'movie', 'was', 'convey', 'idea', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'character', 'was', 'prime', 'did', 'not', 'attend', 'simple', 'detail', 'making', 'sure', 'target', 'was', 'really', 'dead', 'something', 'event', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'professionally', 'trained', 'assassin', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'careless', 'shoot', 'target', 'then', 'escape', 'making', 'sure', 'target', 'was', 'really', 'dead.I', 'left', 'theater', 'feeling', ""'deep"", 'message', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'conveyed', 'tragic', 'failings', 'hero', 'la', 'Lear', 'Hamlet', 'effect', 'was', 'overwrought', 'not', 'convincing.This', 'plot', 'development', 'was', 'entirely', 'too', 'coincidental', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'obsession', 'simple', 'immediately', 'accessible', 'more', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'film', 'cinematography', 'especially', 'do', 'not', 'receive', 'attention', 'deserve']",N/A

It's absolute a riveting tale of what it truly was like for the criminal underworld.

WARNING: This movie is not for the faint at heart or the shallow-minded! The cover art of the movie trailer sets the overall mood of RTP: Dark, bleak and dramatic.The story is of a criminal gang leader whose organization is being torn apart because of his son Connor Rooney going on shooting sprees for no particular reason. The main charachter Mike Sullivan, played by the talented Tom Hanks, is a hitman who works for the elder Rooney(played by Paul Newman) who has to hunt down Connor after his wife & one of his sons is murdered. Sullivan Sr. also has to protect his older son and now only surviving child, Michael Sullivan Jr. and prevent him from living a life like his father is. Another villain, played by Jude Law, is a murderer who photographs his victims as they die and rejoices at the scene. Sullivan Sr & Sullivan Jr. drive around the country robbing banks while escaping the hitman played by Jude Law.The conflicts in the movie truly bring out alot of emotions and create lots of suspense and emotions.

597808,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00005JLBQ,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[4, 7]","You have to be a little wary whenever a movie starts with a nostalgia-drenched voiceover by an adolescent boy...***Uh-oh!  Warning, warning!!***  Will the director have what it takes to rise above this pitfall?  You'd think that Sam Mendes, whose direction of ""American Beauty"" showed remarkable narrative and textural depth and admirably original ironies, would be one of the guys who could redeem themselves after such a palpably weak introduction.  However, this would-be arthouse crime thriller relies too heavily on its measured tempo and soft-edged presentation, but doesn't back it up in the end.  This is, we are clearly and unceasingly telegraphed, a Thinking Person's Crime Film, and as such falls readily into the category of melodrama.  Tom Hanks, ever likeable, plays (oooh!) a bad guy... sort of, but not quite.  A seasoned gunsel for the local Irish mob, Hanks finds himself a victim of his boss's own dirty laundry and, with his life ruined and in peril, he goes on the lam with his 12-year old son, forming a one-and-a-half-man army against the Mob.  This movie is well produced and engaging (and beautifully shot, by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall), but ultimately it's just another hollow glorification of gun culture, masquerading as a morality tale.  I enjoyed watching this film, but felt empty and unnourished as it slid slowly to a halt, and as soon as I started to think about it, even a bit resentful.  This is the sort of Boy Film where it's easier to kill a man's family than to fully construct them as realistic characters, and in which the logic of violence too easily overcomes the reality of emotion -- sort of like a movie version of that old Harry Chapin song, ""Cat's In The Cradle,"" but with lots of guns and a ""happy"" ending where the son realizes what a mensch his gangster dad was.

Mok,"[13, 17]","Road to Perdition is so ambitious that any flaws it may have are made irrelevant by the film's grandiosity of vision, technical brilliance, and unique sensibility.Several members of the production team were carried over from American Beauty -- director Sam Mendes, legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall, brilliant composer Thomas Newman -- but the two films are apples and oranges.  What they do share is a sense of boldness, narrative voices that are unique and distinctive.Hall's photography is once again superlative -- and the larger, more elegiac tone of this film allows him even more room to dazzle with his visual magic.  Thomas Newman's score is inscrutable, once again so intrinsically woven into the fabric of the film that it becomes a seamless part of the whole, enhancing the action rather than sticking out from it.The acting as a whole is wonderful.  Paul Newman still has the ability to ignite the screen with a look; young actor Tyler Hoechlin is terrific as lead character Michael Sullivan, Jr., the gangster's son in danger of following his father's path; and Jude Law is fantastic and eccentric as psychotic hitman Maguire, opting for an engrossing low-key menace.  Tom Hanks is the weak link in the first half of the film; his character is not a well-defined one for a good 45 minutes, and his repressed performance doesn't help.  Fortunately he comes to life in Act 2 of the film with the first bank robbery.  A good thing, for the film's emotional impact hinges on him, and from this point on he acquits himself well.  However, I can't help but think an actor like Liam Neeson (remembering his powerhouse performance in Neil Jordan's Michael Collins) could have brought much more fire, volatility and charisma to this role.  Nonetheless, Hanks works well enough, even if he's one of the flawed elements.  There is a small number of scenes that last a little longer than they need to, as well, even though as a whole the film is quite well paced, and even when scenes run long, the eye-melting cinematography tends to keep you from becoming disengaged.One of Road to Perdition's greatest strengths is that it is unlike any other gangster film in history.  While its themes have been touched upon by the Godfather series, its approach -- kind of a hybrid noir gangster/mismatched buddy/road movie -- is very original indeed.  Just for that, I'd recommend it as essential viewing.

Overall, it has an honesty that comes across from the direction, the actors, the costumes and the scenery/locations.

What Michael does for a living isn't clear at the start but it soon emerges that he is a hit-man for mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman). Twelve-year-old Michael Jr. witnesses one of Sullivan's execution jobs, though it's Rooney's psychopathic son Connor (Daniel Craig) who does the actual shooting. Rooney did not authorize the execution and Connor finds out that Michael Jr. saw the whole incident. He goes to Sullivan's house and kills his wife and son Peter. Michael goes to one of Capone's associates, Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci), for back-up to hunt down and kill Connor; but Rooney will not authorize the hit. Nitti therefore himself hires another hit-man, Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to hunt down and kill Sullivan and his son.

What you don't expect is to have Hank's character do a 'bring your son to work' day, but when Junior comes along for a ride, hiding in the back seat, he gets to see an episode of Dad's reality show unfold live and in bloody color. From there, the elder Sullivan's life is in serious jeopardy and we're on a road trip to hell.As period pieces go, Road to Perdition never waivers from its truth of place and time. Director Sam Mendes profits from having chosen the winter months to tell this riveting and disturbing tale of a loyal hit man on the run who finds redemption along the route while protecting the only family he has left. He finds safety virtually nowhere, and provides for their existence in the cleverest of ways, by robbing banks of their mob money. The hunter becomes the hunted, in a comical star turn by Jude Law, and Sullivan works his way back home to confront the man who kept him off the food lines during the Depression in a brutal opera of mutual betrayal.You'll find no better cinematography in a period film and no better score. The sets were constructed of the fine, dark polished wood one sees in older home construction, the rainy weather lends a metaphoric pall over the proceedings, and the scene where the Sullivans arrive in Chicago suspends disbelief entirely. You are there as the camera elevates to take in 1931 on the street; no detail is overlooked. The music is transporting; John Williams composed the theme and Thomas Newman penned the score. Hanks performance is terrific and underated against his other work; it resonates long after the film credits roll.

597825,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,B00005JLBQ,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[0, 0]","Awhile back I did a review for the movie ""Spy Game"", where the highlight for me was the successfull pairing of Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. I playfully referred to them and Old Hunk (OH) and New Hunk (NH), but meant it in a complimentatry manner. With ""Road to Perdition"", we now have New Master getting to work with Old Master. I don't feel the need to underestimate your intelligence to explain who is who.After so many years in the biz, it was great to see that somebody in Hollywood is wise to try and give Old Master some meaty roles this late in his career. While he himself was a rival to Redford for ""Hunk"" title, Old Master has always been the one who was the master of the craft of acting. In this movie he plays an old gangster who knows and accepts his role in life. He may pay for it in an afterlife, but it is the life he has chosen, and accepts it.Then there is New Master. While it is easy to dismiss him as ""too popular"", one has to admire NM for taking on different, challenging roles. With his stature in Hollywood, he didn't have to take on the physical challenges of a role such as ""Cast Away"", but did anyway. And it's still somewhat of a risk today to play a bad guy, much less a professional killer. New Master takes on this role, but adds depth to it. He is old enough to be totally ""made"" in the profession, but still young enough to question whether this was a good idea or not.The plot is decent, in that we have New Master worrying about leading his son into the life he has chosen. The fact that he has worries about his son proves he has doubts about whether he himself correctly chose the profession. But it is the interraction between OM and NM that make the movie worth seeing.Also good is the filming itself. Remember in ""The Exorcist"" when Father Merrin first arrives at the steps of Regan's residence? The dark, rainy, foggy stuff? Well, this movie is full of this.

597826,A31WE0G828ZWY5,B00005JLBQ,Eric J. Lyman,"[1, 2]","I don't know why this wonderful period film hasn't received more serious attention. Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are fantastic in it, the cinematography is absolutely captivating, and the story line has everything between a battle against fate to Biblical overtones. It's a film about killing and gangsters that avoids gore and car chases in favor of plot.Mr. Hanks plays small-town hit man Michael Sullivan, an orphan raised as a son by the mob's crusty boss John Rooney, played by Mr. Newman. Sullivan's son mistakenly witnesses one of his father's hits, forcing Sullivan to choose between his real family and his crime family. Rooney's son Conner  (played by Daniel Craig) complicated things by plotting to push Sullivan out and Sullivan decides to take the boy (played by Tyler Hoechlin) to the safety of a relative's house in a town called Perdition, a fancy word for Hell.The town's name is not the last of the symbolism. The weary choice facing Rooney in regards to Sullivan and to Sullivan in regards to his son is reminiscent of the Biblical story of Abraham and Isaac. More compellingly, the battle between Sullivan and Rooney's son Conner recalls the story of Cain and Abel.But the whole film recalls an increasingly desperate battle against fate ... nobody seems to break free of it. Mr. Hanks' Sullivan desperately wants his son to avoid the Hell of life as a hit man (but what an example he sets: Sullivan kills almost every other character in the film), but he tries to do so by taking him to Hell (Perdition). It is in Perdition that the most obvious symbolism takes place: once father and son arrive, the boy stands at the edge of Hell when he holds the gun in his hand and has a chance to kill the photographer/hit man character played by Jude Law. But he doesn't pull the trigger and he remains pure. The film ends like it begins, on the brightly lit beach -- heaven near the house in Perdition.The brightly lit ending is particularly noticeable because of the gritty cinematography that makes most of the film feel almost as if it was shot in black and white (and more black than white).The only thing I didn't like about the film was the ending, which seemed to wrap things up a little too predictably and even unbelievably. It seems like a stretch that the character Sullivan would not figure out what was about to happen in the closing minutes of the film when I and the other people I watched the film with could see it coming -- recall that this is a character who instantly processed and avoided what was about to happen in the diner and again after he found the mob's accountant. The only explanation I could come up with was that on some level Sullivan wanted the story to end that way, which just seems contrived in a different way to me.I'm also a little displeased with the character played by Mr. Law, whose strangely feminine edge makes him into the film's creepiest character, but who missed an opportunity to be unforgettable when he failed to illustrate his motives better. Similarly, Hoechlin, the boy, too often seems in awe, and as a result comes off a bit two-dimensional.Still, the overall product is too well done to be overlooked to the extent that it was. I could understand an Academy Award snub in a strong year, but it was nominated for just six awards (only one was major, for the supporting role played by Mr. Newman). In the end, it won only the award for cinematography in a year so weak that the rudderless Chicago won best picture and the formulaic Gangs of New York and that year's installment of the Lord of the Rings (Two Towers) were much better received.",4,Escaping fate,1083369600,"05 1, 2004",2004,3609,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'wonderful', 'period', 'film', ""n't"", 'received', 'more', 'serious', 'attention', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'are', 'fantastic', 'cinematography', 'absolutely', 'captivating', 'story', 'line', 'everything', 'battle', 'fate', 'Biblical', 'overtones', 'film', 'killing', 'gangsters', 'avoids', 'gore', 'car', 'chases', 'favor', 'plot.Mr', 'Hanks', 'small-town', 'hit', 'man', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'orphan', 'raised', 'son', 'mob', 'crusty', 'boss', 'John', 'Rooney', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Newman', 'Sullivan', 'son', 'mistakenly', 'one', 'father', 'hits', 'forcing', 'Sullivan', 'choose', 'real', 'family', 'crime', 'family', 'Rooney', 'son', 'Conner', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'complicated', 'things', 'plotting', 'push', 'Sullivan', 'Sullivan', 'take', 'boy', 'played', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'safety', 'relative', 'house', 'town', 'called', 'Perdition', 'fancy', 'word', 'Hell.The', 'town', 'name', 'not', 'last', 'symbolism', 'weary', 'choice', 'facing', 'Rooney', 'regards', 'Sullivan', 'Sullivan', 'regards', 'son', 'reminiscent', 'Biblical', 'story', 'Abraham', 'Isaac', 'More', 'compellingly', 'battle', 'Sullivan', 'Rooney', 'son', 'Conner', 'story', 'Cain', 'Abel.But', 'whole', 'film', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'battle', 'fate', 'nobody', 'break', 'free', 'Mr.', 'Hanks', 'Sullivan', 'desperately', 'son', 'avoid', 'Hell', 'life', 'hit', 'man', 'what', 'example', 'Sullivan', 'almost', 'other', 'character', 'film', 'do', 'so', 'taking', 'Hell', 'Perdition', 'Perdition', 'most', 'obvious', 'symbolism', 'place', 'once', 'father', 'son', 'arrive', 'boy', 'edge', 'Hell', 'when', 'gun', 'hand', 'chance', 'kill', 'photographer/hit', 'man', 'character', 'played', 'Jude', 'Law', ""n't"", 'pull', 'trigger', 'pure', 'film', 'brightly', 'lit', 'beach', 'heaven', 'house', 'Perdition.The', 'brightly', 'lit', 'ending', 'particularly', 'noticeable', 'gritty', 'cinematography', 'most', 'film', 'feel', 'almost', 'was', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'more', 'black', 'white', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'was', 'ending', 'seemed', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'little', 'too', 'predictably', 'even', 'unbelievably', 'stretch', 'character', 'Sullivan', 'would', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'happen', 'closing', 'minutes', 'film', 'when', 'other', 'people', 'watched', 'film', 'could', 'see', 'coming', 'recall', 'character', 'who', 'instantly', 'processed', 'avoided', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'happen', 'diner', 'again', 'found', 'mob', 'accountant', 'only', 'explanation', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'was', 'level', 'Sullivan', 'wanted', 'story', 'end', 'way', 'just', 'contrived', 'different', 'way', 'me.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'little', 'displeased', 'character', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Law', 'strangely', 'feminine', 'edge', 'film', 'creepiest', 'character', 'who', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'be', 'unforgettable', 'when', 'failed', 'illustrate', 'motives', 'better', 'Similarly', 'Hoechlin', 'boy', 'too', 'often', 'awe', 'result', 'off', 'bit', 'two-dimensional.Still', 'overall', 'product', 'too', 'well', 'done', 'be', 'overlooked', 'extent', 'was', 'could', 'understand', 'Academy', 'Award', 'snub', 'strong', 'year', 'was', 'nominated', 'just', 'six', 'awards', 'only', 'one', 'was', 'major', 'supporting', 'role', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Newman', 'end', 'won', 'only', 'award', 'cinematography', 'year', 'so', 'weak', 'rudderless', 'Chicago', 'won', 'best', 'picture', 'formulaic', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'year', 'installment', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Two', 'Towers', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'received']",N/A

597829,A1SE0248RACMPY,B00005JLBQ,FiLmFrEaK99,"[6, 8]","""Road to Perdition"" is Greek-type tragedy set in Depression-Era America with mobsters as its heroes, or anti-heroes. Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a mob enforcer who works for John Rooney, played wonderfully by Paul Newman. Tyler Hoechlin is Hank's son, Michael Jr, who on the one hand is the omnipresent narrator, but also represents the tragic flaw of his father. Men who name their sons after themselves presumably hope they will turn out like them. However Michael Sr. does not want his son involved in his evil ways, but Michael Jr. inevitably gets caught up when he witnesses one of his father's murders.  This sets in motion a chain of events which ultimately lead to father and son fleeing on the road to perdition, or road to hell.  What comes about is the film's central theme, and question:  Is it possible for fathers to spare their sons from the costs of their sins?The film has some great performances, particularly from Newman, and Jude Law who plays a dispicable hitman/crime scene photographer. The dull colored costumes fit perfectly with the bleak time period, the production design authentically recreates 1930s Chicago, and the Thomas Newman score is somber and haunting.  Yet what stands out is the amazing cinematography from the 'Master of Darkness,' Conrad L. Hall.  Never has such a bleak picture looked so vibrant.  Hall creates a limbo of shadows, half seen faces, and rain-soaked frames. Each shot presents a visceral chill that reverberates throughout the film. Brilliant work!  And in his sophomore effort following the acclaimed, ""American Beauty,"" Sam Mendes proves that he is a master craftsman.""Road to Perdition"" is a good film and worth watching, but there is something about it that prevented the film from being great. For me, part of the problem is that the film plays too much like a Greek tragedy. The characters' seem to lack the ability to make choices. Even though many of them chose their way of life, none of them seem too particularly proud of it. Everyone speaks like they're in a catatonic state. It is as if their fates were decided long ago and they could do nothing about it. As a result, the character's parts are not so much revealed, as they are performed; and the film becomes very distant and muted in its emotions.The Father/Son relationship at the core of the film should be geniune, but comes across as awkward. Now Tyler Hoechlin is young and this is his first film, but much of the problem actually stems from Hanks. Tom Hanks is an exceptional actor, but he is miscast in this role. His performance is too introspective to really come across as an individual who kills for a living. Hanks goes through most of the film feeling sorry for himself, as if he were forced to become hitman. Another reviewer mentioned this, imagine someone like Gabriel Byrne from ""Miller's Crossing,"" and you have what Michael Sullivan could have been. If Hanks would have shown a little more edge, or even a glimmer of interest in his profession, then he would have transcended the role and truly become a ""bad guy,"" like Al Pacino in ""The Godfather,"" or even Robin Williams in ""Insomnia"" and ""One Hour Photo"". But Hanks doesn't venture into that dark territory, and instead, turns in a performance that is really no different than in ""Saving Private Ryan;"" an individual who kills because he has to.

It is ultimately a story of love and betrayal, duty and devotion, tempered by the stark black-and-white sensibilities of 30s-era crime lords and the social auras of that time.Tom Hanks - who can play anything flawlessly, from drama to comedy - is Michael Sullivan, a man who came under the wing of John Rooney (Paul Newman, in a stellar turn for a stellar career), boss of the Irish mafia in the Midwest, when his father died. His characterization of the role is perfect; austere, careful, guarded, foreboding, he is John Rooney's chosen, even over Rooney's actual son, Connor (played by Daniel Craig, also to perfection, prior to his emergence as the new Bond). Connor seethes with jealousy about this which is quite clear. He knows he is less in his father's eyes than Michael is; not as smart, not as good at his job, almost subservient to his adopted brother. We see Michael in the role of enforcer only twice, and neither instance comes off as planned, but it is also clear that this is a man canny in the way of his profession and who knows exactly what needs to be done.Michael has worked for John Rooney all his life, and has been rewarded with a good living and a nice house. He is married to a lovely woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh, in a small but effective role) and has two boys, Peter and Michael Jr. Both boys have a burning curiousity about what their father does for a living, and the elder of the two, Michael (Tyler Hoechlin, in an impressive first role) decides to stow away one night when his father goes out on a job to find out. He witnesses something traumatic that he should never have seen, and sets in motion an epic journey as his father realizes the boy must be removed from the attentions of those who are running the show.The acting in this film is superb all around. It had the misfortune to come out in a year thick with great films and so was overlooked at awards time, but in a thinner year would certainly have been up for consideration in a number of categories. Thomas Newman was nominated for a score that is haunting and beautiful - I could not wait to get it, and have already worn out one CD - and which complements the film perfectly, creating an evocative, atmospheric audio background without being overpowering. The settings are impressive also; small Midwestern cities, Chicago during that era, a diner in the middle of nowhere at night which evokes visions of an Edward Hopper painting, a beach house on Lake Michigan. There are great smaller roles; Jude Law as a grimy, sleazy gun-for-hire; Stanley Tucci, always good, as the boss of a Chicago gang that Michael Sullivan turns to for help. The movie is not without small moments of humor; Michael Sullivan, Sr teaching Michael Sullivan, Jr how to drive is amusing and warmhearted, and typical Tom Hanks.The film benefits from an excellent script and great direction from Sam Mendes.Michael Sullivan, Jr, spends 6 weeks on the road with his father, learning about the man he knew little of until their flight away from their former life, and while it is not a journey one would recommend as a coming-of-age, I absolutely loved it. Both Paul Newman and Tom Hanks are unsurpassed as actors, and they don't disappoint here.",5,Atmospheric Prohibition-era coming-of-age gem,1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,3328,"['Nothing', 'can', 'say', 'great', 'movie', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'love', 'so', 'dearly', 'must', 'write', 'ultimately', 'story', 'love', 'betrayal', 'duty', 'devotion', 'tempered', 'stark', 'black-and-white', 'sensibilities', '30s-era', 'crime', 'lords', 'social', 'auras', 'time.Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'anything', 'flawlessly', 'drama', 'comedy', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'man', 'who', 'came', 'wing', 'John', 'Rooney', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'stellar', 'turn', 'stellar', 'career', 'boss', 'Irish', 'mafia', 'Midwest', 'when', 'father', 'died', 'characterization', 'role', 'perfect', 'austere', 'careful', 'guarded', 'foreboding', 'John', 'Rooney', 'chosen', 'even', 'Rooney', 'actual', 'son', 'Connor', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'also', 'perfection', 'prior', 'emergence', 'new', 'Bond', 'Connor', 'seethes', 'jealousy', 'quite', 'clear', 'less', 'father', 'eyes', 'Michael', 'not', 'smart', 'not', 'good', 'job', 'almost', 'subservient', 'adopted', 'brother', 'see', 'Michael', 'role', 'enforcer', 'only', 'twice', 'instance', 'off', 'planned', 'also', 'clear', 'man', 'canny', 'way', 'profession', 'who', 'exactly', 'what', 'be', 'done.Michael', 'worked', 'John', 'Rooney', 'life', 'been', 'rewarded', 'good', 'living', 'nice', 'house', 'married', 'lovely', 'woman', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'small', 'effective', 'role', 'two', 'boys', 'Peter', 'Michael', 'Jr', 'boys', 'have', 'burning', 'curiousity', 'what', 'father', 'living', 'elder', 'two', 'Michael', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'impressive', 'first', 'role', 'stow', 'away', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'father', 'out', 'job', 'find', 'out', 'something', 'traumatic', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'sets', 'motion', 'epic', 'journey', 'father', 'boy', 'must', 'be', 'removed', 'attentions', 'who', 'are', 'running', 'show.The', 'acting', 'film', 'superb', 'around', 'had', 'misfortune', 'come', 'out', 'year', 'thick', 'great', 'films', 'so', 'was', 'overlooked', 'awards', 'time', 'thinner', 'year', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'consideration', 'number', 'categories', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'was', 'nominated', 'score', 'haunting', 'beautiful', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'get', 'have', 'already', 'worn', 'out', 'one', 'CD', 'film', 'perfectly', 'creating', 'evocative', 'atmospheric', 'audio', 'background', 'being', 'overpowering', 'settings', 'are', 'impressive', 'also', 'small', 'Midwestern', 'cities', 'Chicago', 'era', 'diner', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'night', 'visions', 'Edward', 'Hopper', 'painting', 'beach', 'house', 'Lake', 'Michigan', 'are', 'great', 'smaller', 'roles', 'Jude', 'Law', 'grimy', 'sleazy', 'gun-for-hire', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'always', 'good', 'boss', 'Chicago', 'gang', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'help', 'movie', 'not', 'small', 'moments', 'humor', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Sr', 'teaching', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Jr', 'how', 'drive', 'amusing', 'warmhearted', 'typical', 'Tom', 'Hanks.The', 'film', 'benefits', 'excellent', 'script', 'great', 'direction', 'Sam', 'Mendes.Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Jr', '6', 'weeks', 'road', 'father', 'learning', 'man', 'knew', 'little', 'flight', 'away', 'former', 'life', 'not', 'journey', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'coming-of-age', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'are', 'unsurpassed', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here']",N/A

Sullivan is also devoted to his private life as a husband and father of two young boys. When his two worlds collide, resulting in tragedy, Sullivan and his older son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), leave their home and embark on a journey of revenge and discovery.David Self's script is simple, subtle, and straightforward. It presents some interesting issues concerning redemption, fathers, sons, and violence. Despite the script being occasionally predictable, Sam Mendes's superb direction allows for quite a bit of tension.The performances in Perdition are fantastic, particularly Hanks and Newman. Hanks's performance is one of his finest, to date. He's reserved, brooding, and conflicted. His performance ranks alongside the great Al Pacino performances. Like Pacino, Hanks is able to show a great deal of emotion through total silence. Newman effectively creates a portrait of a man who is both imposing and pathetic. Jude Law leaves quite an impression, for having such little screentime, as Hanks and his son's pursuer.Apart from great performances, Perdition boasts stunning set & costume designs, a grand musical score, and deliberate; appropriate pacing. It's also beautifully photographed. The film has a very cold, muted palette which reflects the characters and the time period.Some have compared Road to Perdition to The Godfather.

597835,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005JLBQ,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[36, 53]","Based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, which was in turn based very loosely on various factual stories of the 1930s, THE ROAD TO PERDITION tells the story of Michael Sullivan, a family man and thoroughly nice guy who also happens to be an enforcer and hit man for the Irish Mob.  Sullivan strives to keep his homelife separate from his work--but son Michael Jr. precipitates disaster when he follows his father and witnesses a murder.  Determined to both protect his son and have revenge on the mob boys who have suddenly turned on him, Sullivan goes on the run with Michael, and in the process finally ""finds his heart"" through his determination that young Michael will never walk his road.There is a great deal to like about this film.  The cinematography is astonishingly beautiful and extremely well supported by the editing, which is among the best I've ever seen, and the soundtrack, which lends the story a meloncholy depth.  Many of the cast members are also exceptional, most particularly Jude Law, who creates perhaps the most chilling killer seen on screen in a decade.  But the film has two significant problems: the plot and the star.There are several issues with the plot, and the overwhelming one is its predictability.  There is nothing new until one reaches midpoint, when Sullivan--with the assistance of his son--attempts to force the mafia to permit his revenge via a series of bank robberies in which he takes only mafia money.  This was quite an original idea, and very intriguing, so I was doubly frustrated when the film took yet another predictable twist that effectively negated that rather large chunk of film time.  The other issue here is Tom Hanks.  Hanks is an extraordinary actor, and the role of a hitman seemed a unique opportunity for him to blow off the super-likeable parts for which he has become famous.  But instead of doing this, Tom Hanks essentially gives a standard super-likeable Tom Hanks performance, and I found it increasingly difficult to believe him as a mob enforcer, much less to give his drive for bloody revenge any creedence.When all is said and done, what is left is a film that essentially holds you by virtue of sheer cinematic technique.  THE ROAD TO PERDITION has an amazing sense of style and creates an amazing visual portrait of the era, and that--along with such performers as Jude Law--held my interest to the end.  But far from ""finding its heart,"" the film is hollow, a matter of style over substance, and I found the story obvious, the conclusion foregone, and the statement commonplace.  While I did enjoy the film, I do not expect to revisit it.  As for the DVD itself, it is a nice package, with the visual and aural elements extremely well done; I found the bonus material, however, as bland in content as the film itself.  Now, this film has garnered many fans, and I say if you can get something out of it, more power to you, and it will be well worth the investment.  But at the same time, I would suggest that you rent this one before you purchase it, for you may just as easily fall into the other catagory--in which case you'll consider THE ROAD TO PERDITION barely worth the trip.",3,Elegantly Made But Unexpectedly Superficial,1047168000,"03 9, 2003",2003,3170,"['Based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Max', 'Allan', 'Collins', 'was', 'turn', 'based', 'very', 'loosely', 'various', 'factual', 'stories', '1930s', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'PERDITION', 'story', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'man', 'thoroughly', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'enforcer', 'hit', 'man', 'Irish', 'Mob', 'Sullivan', 'keep', 'homelife', 'separate', 'work', 'son', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'disaster', 'when', 'father', 'murder', 'Determined', 'protect', 'son', 'have', 'revenge', 'mob', 'boys', 'who', 'have', 'suddenly', 'turned', 'Sullivan', 'run', 'Michael', 'process', 'finally', 'heart', 'determination', 'young', 'Michael', 'will', 'never', 'walk', 'road.There', 'great', 'deal', 'like', 'film', 'cinematography', 'astonishingly', 'beautiful', 'extremely', 'well', 'supported', 'editing', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'soundtrack', 'story', 'meloncholy', 'depth', 'Many', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'also', 'exceptional', 'most', 'particularly', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'perhaps', 'most', 'chilling', 'killer', 'seen', 'screen', 'decade', 'film', 'two', 'significant', 'problems', 'plot', 'star.There', 'are', 'several', 'issues', 'plot', 'overwhelming', 'one', 'predictability', 'nothing', 'new', 'one', 'reaches', 'midpoint', 'when', 'Sullivan', 'assistance', 'son', 'attempts', 'force', 'mafia', 'permit', 'revenge', 'series', 'bank', 'robberies', 'only', 'mafia', 'money', 'was', 'quite', 'original', 'idea', 'very', 'intriguing', 'was', 'doubly', 'frustrated', 'when', 'film', 'took', 'yet', 'predictable', 'twist', 'effectively', 'negated', 'rather', 'large', 'chunk', 'film', 'time', 'other', 'issue', 'here', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Hanks', 'extraordinary', 'actor', 'role', 'hitman', 'seemed', 'unique', 'opportunity', 'blow', 'off', 'super-likeable', 'parts', 'become', 'famous', 'instead', 'doing', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'essentially', 'standard', 'super-likeable', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'found', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'believe', 'mob', 'enforcer', 'much', 'less', 'give', 'drive', 'bloody', 'revenge', 'creedence.When', 'said', 'done', 'what', 'left', 'film', 'essentially', 'virtue', 'sheer', 'cinematic', 'technique', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'PERDITION', 'amazing', 'sense', 'style', 'amazing', 'visual', 'portrait', 'era', 'such', 'performers', 'Jude', 'Law', 'held', 'interest', 'end', 'far', 'finding', 'heart', 'film', 'hollow', 'matter', 'style', 'substance', 'found', 'story', 'obvious', 'conclusion', 'foregone', 'statement', 'commonplace', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'revisit', 'DVD', 'nice', 'package', 'visual', 'aural', 'elements', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'found', 'bonus', 'material', 'however', 'bland', 'content', 'film', 'Now', 'film', 'garnered', 'many', 'fans', 'say', 'can', 'get', 'something', 'more', 'power', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'investment', 'same', 'time', 'would', 'suggest', 'rent', 'one', 'purchase', 'may', 'just', 'easily', 'fall', 'other', 'catagory', 'case', ""'ll"", 'consider', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'PERDITION', 'barely', 'trip']",N/A

Until it watched 'Road To Perdition'. A gangster movie made with several murder scenes, but with such a serene pace is not common. That a movie with gore events can ultimately be summed up as an aesthetic work can be largely attributed to the magnificent work of cinematographer Conrad L Hill and to the script as well. The movie never rushes, nor the camera. Deaths are shown in the eyes of a young lad, in the reflection of a mirror, through the glass of a window, while jazz music is entertaining people in the next room...  enormous possibility has been created in this movie to depict murder shots. The movie can be a lesson about how glass and rain can be used as a photographic subject. Also ubiquitous is rain and snow. 'Depression' can be constantly felt throughout the film - be it weather, be it light, be it Tom Hank's face. The brilliant music of the movie (by Tomas Newman) interestingly keeps a well maintained distance from the ongoing carnage on the screen. All through its a symphonic and melancholic music. Its truly wonderful music, can be termed as an asset of the movie.After you watch it, or while watching, you may be reminded of 'The Godfather'. Difference is, while the main protagonist of 'Godfather' was a very powerful man, here Sullivan is not that a big player, rather a pawn. He cannot dictate terms or take decisions. Here he is in the middle of the top boss and the common people whom he fires his gun. His bad luck is no less than his victims. Out of a small accident of his son's watching a murder (the weakest point of the movie - not convincing), he is a fugitive in one night.That the entire episode of six weeks is observed and told by a young boy is another new angle to a gangster movie.

Apart from the child's night adventure, the successive bank robberies, medical help to get rid of the bullet (the host did not even think to go to police!), Hank's visit to Newman to complain about his son's stealing, Sullivan Sr. never even mourns the loss of his family, later killing Newman and his party with a machine gun - there are too many lose ends.

The plot of 'Road to Perdition' is not especially remarkable.  It involves well-worn themes from Mafia films like honor, revenge, family and the desire to get away from this violent world, and the characters are nothing particularly new either.  (Tom Hanks is the cold, workmanlike killer, Daniel Craig the crazy wild card protected by his position as the son of Paul Newman, who is the surprisingly warm and kind mafia boss who is, nevertheless, utterly ruthless at heart etc.)  There's certainly nothing wrong with this plot, and it has some fine lines and a few particularly affecting scenes, but it's nothing to get to overly worked up over.  Still, the sheer craft displayed herein makes the film remarkable.  The performances are all perfect, the score, while perhaps overly conventional, is powerful and emotive, the cinematography is consistently stunning and the period detail is utterly convincing.  Again, this is a world we've seen before, but it's more fully realized then ever before, and it makes the film nearly mesmerizing even in the scenes where little is actually going on.  Also, there's one scene late in the film, a firefight in the streets during fierce storm, which is simply breath taking.  It's definitely one of the most powerful examples of pure cinema I've seen in a long time.Yeah, that's it.

I saw this in a typically sun shiny morning and I can tell you if you are up for a depressing yet wonderful film to jumpstart your day, I suggest Road to Perdition.The film is about a mob gangster Michael Sullivan who was betrayed by his boss bceause his son, Michael Jr inadvertently witnesses a murder. So, to tie all loose ends, mob boss John Rooney decides to kill his loyal right-hand man. But when Connor Rooney, John Rooney's son, mercilessly kills his family (only his older son Michael Jr surviving), he decides to go on a vendetta to avenge his family's death.The story is not your typical gangster film. There's no police cops to arrest mob bosses here nor drug cartels for that matter. The story is focused on Michael Sullivan's revenge on the people who betrayed him. Sam Mendes and the writers managed to excellently blend a father-and-child story angle in a gangster themed story.The performances were great. Tom Hanks as usual delivers, Jude Law unexpectedly sent chills down to my ancestors as a creepy looking psychopath/photographer. Paul Newman as the aging mob boss was great as well. One minute you hate him for betraying his loyal right-hand man, the next minute you don't want him to die soaking wet.Daniel Craig, before James Bond, portrayed an annoying scheming mischievous son to a mob boss. He had it coming to him. Yes, he was spot on with his performance too.The best scene in the entire film would probably be when Michael Sullivan ambushed John Rooney and his mob thugs drenched in rain. Sam Mendes did this slow-mo shot when Michael was shooting them with a machine gun in a distant house and the thugs were like dropping like flies and John was by the car, with his head down realizing his grim fate. Michael killed all of them except John. So, he approached him with gun in his hand, John turns to him, almost into tears and utters what probably is the best line of the film: ""I'm glad its you"". Michael with a sad look then shoots him down.That scene will stay in my head forever. It was emotional, sad, depressing and it almost wanna make you cry but somehow you feel that the Michael character is doing the right thing.

But I have to admit: the reason that made me look forward to it was Tom Hanks's presence. He's always been one of the actors I have adored the most during the nineties; I had seen him play a wistful widower in ""Sleepless in Seattle"", the slowwitted Forest Gump, a lawyer afflicted with aids in ""Philadelphia"", Captain Miller in ""Saving Private Ryan"", the astronaut Jim Lovell in ""Apollo 13"", big boss Joe Fox in ""You've got mail"", Chuck the castaway, and many other remarkable characters throughout his career. So I was really curious to see Tom the bad guy, the henchman, as this could be a completely different role from all those he had been playing up to this point. Mike Sullivan is not the kind of bad guy De Niro and Pacino used to play during the seventies and eighties, but kind of respectable, gracious (can I say this?) murder, and I have to admit, he plays it with grace.When I look back to the nineties, I can't find another actor who has made so many movies varying from very good to excellent artistic quality as Hanks has made. And one of the best things about him is that while many actors submit themselves to the ""one for the purse and one for the heart"" rule, he's one of those few actors who make movies that are both excellent artistically and make big bucks at the box office. He's both a great actor and a movie star. Sean Pen is a great actor, Pacino is a great actor, De Niro, Duvall, Hoffman, Spacey, these guys are great actors. Tom Cruise is a movie star, Bruce Willis is a movie star, Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan, Sandler, Schwarzeneger, these are movie stars. Tom Hanks is both, and right now I can't think of someone else who is, except Jack Nicholson. Hanks has an enormous screen presence and an extremely spontaneous acting style: he can play melodrama without resorting to melodramatics; he acts with his eyes and the slightest alterings of expression speak volumes on the large screen, a gentle smile, a grin, a lifting of eyebrows, a slight downturn of the mouth and other subtle things make this guy an extraordinary actor.It suddenly dawned on me that I actually wrote a review about Hanks and not about ""Road to Perdition"", but frankly, Tom's play was the best thing this movie brought to my attention.",4,Tom Hanks - the best actor of his generation!,1065830400,"10 11, 2003",2003,2441,"['was', 'eager', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'ago', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'made', 'American', 'Beauty', 'storyline', 'seemed', 'very', 'appealing', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Jude', 'Law', 'were', 'have', 'admit', 'reason', 'made', 'look', 'forward', 'was', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'presence', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'actors', 'have', 'adored', 'most', 'nineties', 'had', 'seen', 'play', 'wistful', 'widower', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'slowwitted', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'lawyer', 'afflicted', 'aids', 'Philadelphia', 'Captain', 'Miller', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'astronaut', 'Jim', 'Lovell', 'Apollo', '13', 'big', 'boss', 'Joe', 'Fox', ""'ve"", 'got', 'mail', 'Chuck', 'castaway', 'many', 'other', 'remarkable', 'characters', 'career', 'was', 'really', 'curious', 'see', 'Tom', 'bad', 'guy', 'henchman', 'could', 'be', 'completely', 'different', 'role', 'had', 'been', 'playing', 'up', 'point', 'Mike', 'Sullivan', 'not', 'kind', 'bad', 'guy', 'De', 'Niro', 'Pacino', 'used', 'play', 'seventies', 'eighties', 'kind', 'respectable', 'gracious', 'can', 'say', 'murder', 'have', 'admit', 'grace.When', 'look', 'back', 'nineties', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'actor', 'who', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'varying', 'very', 'good', 'excellent', 'artistic', 'quality', 'Hanks', 'made', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'many', 'actors', 'submit', 'one', 'purse', 'one', 'heart', 'rule', 'one', 'few', 'actors', 'who', 'make', 'movies', 'are', 'excellent', 'artistically', 'make', 'big', 'bucks', 'box', 'office', 'great', 'actor', 'movie', 'star', 'Sean', 'Pen', 'great', 'actor', 'Pacino', 'great', 'actor', 'De', 'Niro', 'Duvall', 'Hoffman', 'Spacey', 'guys', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'star', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'movie', 'star', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Sandler', 'Schwarzeneger', 'are', 'movie', 'stars', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'right', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'someone', 'else', 'who', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Hanks', 'enormous', 'screen', 'presence', 'extremely', 'spontaneous', 'acting', 'style', 'can', 'play', 'melodrama', 'resorting', 'melodramatics', 'eyes', 'slightest', 'alterings', 'expression', 'speak', 'volumes', 'large', 'screen', 'gentle', 'smile', 'grin', 'lifting', 'eyebrows', 'slight', 'downturn', 'mouth', 'other', 'subtle', 'things', 'make', 'guy', 'extraordinary', 'actor.It', 'suddenly', 'dawned', 'actually', 'wrote', 'review', 'Hanks', 'not', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'frankly', 'Tom', 'play', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'brought', 'attention']",N/A

Make no mistake, Sullivan was no saint himself. He was as vicious a human being as any of the other mobsters of that day. But for whatever reason, Michael Sullivan Sr. had been humanized -- he had a family: a son. Of course, Paul Newman's character, Mr. Rooney, also had a son, but the relationship between Rooney and his son was quite different than that between Sullivan and his surviving son or even that between Rooney and Sullivan, Sr., but you can't really care about those relationships, even though you could wonder about them. This last relationship wasn't even reliable, as evidenced by Rooney's willingness to have Sullivan killed. No, this man Sullivan actually cared for his son, and that relationship was strengthened throughout the movie and reaffirmed at the farmhouse. I cared about Michael Sullivan and wanted him to win, and I was VERY disturbed by the way he met his end.If there's any good feeling to come away with at the end of the movie, at least it's the knowledge that Sullivan died knowing that his son was not a killer, and maybe would not be following in his footsteps. Then again, it may be that Sullivan purposely did not give his boy the chance to discover whether or not he was one.When this movie comes up in conversation, I hear things like ""what great cinematography, and the skillful use of visual tricks with the rain, the light, and the dark, or even that the violence involved was not ""gratuitous"" or violence for its own sake. (What?!) But I must say, it's difficult to appreciate all that when you're in a movie theatre with too-loud speakers and a fuzzy screen and you're having to listen to machine gun fire seemingly every ten minutes or looking at someone with their throat slit or with a bullet in their head. I'm at a loss as to why I needed to see that.I'm also at a loss as to why the point-of-view changed from kid to outside observer then back to kid. I can't help but think that if this film -- the story -- had remained in the point of view of the surviving son, then the father/son dynamic might have been observed and appreciated without the distraction of disturbing violence.As far as I'm concerned, something needs to come along between now and February that will take it out of Oscar contention. I'm sure that won't happen, the ""cineastes"" are raving and they probably vote.

One more film on the mafia, both Italian and Irish. And yet this film has a slightly different touch. It is the fact that the father-son issue is widely explored. A mafia boss has a foolish and cheating son. He protects him and takes under his wing another man, Michael Sullivan, to transfer his paternal love onto someone worth it. Unluckily a detail one night brings the son of this latter man, Michael Sullivan Jr., into the act of witnessing the son of the mafia boss killing another good man on the spur of his anger. This son of a mafia boss will then try to clean up his plate and start killing everyone connected to that embarrassing witness. Michael Sullivan Sr. then has to get on the road of vengeance after the killing of his wife and younger son. He thus escapes the killers with his older son and yet he will end up falling in the last trap out of sloppiness, maybe just to be even with fate and God.

597865,A3RIIMSG5HB0J8,B00005JLBQ,"""jake_l""","[39, 57]","As far as I am concerned this is the first real gangster film since 1992's CASINO and if you have ever seen the two masterpieces that are the best movies in American history (Godfather Parts 1 and 2) you know that almost without exception mob movies are always great.  (The reason I say CASINO is latest mob movie is because I don't really think HEAT is a mafia movie though it is also good.)This movie looks different.  It looks to play the family angle since the premise is that Tom Hanks is playing one of Al Capone's assasins in 1930's Chicago and his son sees him doig a job on a poor victim.  Now they have to flee together from Capone.  (*NOTE: Paul Newman also plays Hank's father figure in yet another brilliant role for Newman) This looks to be an escape from the popcorn movies of the summer, even though some of them have been pretty good this year.  This movie also looks to use historical figures.  I don't know what Hank's character is named but I am fairly sure he was a real man and of course Capone is real as well.  Another thing this movie has or really doesn't have is the Italian greats (Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Joe Peschi, Ray Liotta, or even Andy Garcia) but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a stellar cast.  These are three things the Godfather had and others did not have which is why this is my pick to win Best Picture (even though the Oscars are 8 months way)Don't let any tv spots fool you because a mere mortal guy could have as just as much fun as a high-and-mighty movie crictic in this one.  Much like most mob movies you don't have to analyze eveything to realize its a great movie.Everyone is great in this movie. Not a suprise really but I am swallowing a lot of pride saying that Tom Hank's is great in this since I am NOT his biggest fan at all.  Of course Paul Newman is great.  The costumes are also exceptionaly well done.  The lighting is good (one thing that made the Godfather).  The plot is very interesting and sort of glorifies the mob and brow beats it all the same time, another element of the Godfather.The bottomline is with Star Wars, Spider-Man, Scooby Doo, etc. out there right now there are not too many movies a mature teen or and adult can go see and not be worried about any kiddie elements.  Well this is that movie.One Thing you may want to know is:*WHAT IS PERDITION?I didn't know what Perdition was until I saw a previe guide that said it meant eternal Hell.  This makes the title great and sort of a subject of conversation.Can this movie have the impact of the Godfather?Can it be as good as the Godfather?Will it be fun?Will it be an Oscar-contender?Well all those questions should be put to rest one way or another but at ant rate, I will see you in theaters July 12th when it opens nationwide.",5,Finally A New Mafia Movie!,1025222400,"06 28, 2002",2002,2765,"['As', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'first', 'real', 'gangster', 'film', '1992', 'CASINO', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'two', 'masterpieces', 'are', 'best', 'movies', 'American', 'history', 'Godfather', '1', '2', 'know', 'almost', 'exception', 'mob', 'movies', 'are', 'always', 'great', 'reason', 'say', 'CASINO', 'latest', 'mob', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'HEAT', 'mafia', 'movie', 'also', 'good', 'movie', 'different', 'play', 'family', 'angle', 'premise', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'playing', 'one', 'Al', 'Capone', 'assasins', '1930', 'Chicago', 'son', 'doig', 'job', 'poor', 'victim', 'Now', 'have', 'flee', 'together', 'Capone', '*NOTE', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'also', 'Hank', 'father', 'figure', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'role', 'Newman', 'be', 'escape', 'popcorn', 'movies', 'summer', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'year', 'movie', 'also', 'use', 'historical', 'figures', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Hank', 'character', 'named', 'am', 'fairly', 'sure', 'was', 'real', 'man', 'course', 'Capone', 'real', 'as', 'well', 'thing', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'Italian', 'greats', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Joe', 'Peschi', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'even', 'Andy', 'Garcia', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'have', 'stellar', 'cast', 'are', 'three', 'things', 'Godfather', 'had', 'others', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'why', 'pick', 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', 'even', 'Oscars', 'are', '8', 'months', 'way', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'tv', 'spots', 'fool', 'mere', 'mortal', 'guy', 'could', 'have', 'as', 'just', 'much', 'fun', 'high-and-mighty', 'movie', 'crictic', 'one', 'Much', 'most', 'mob', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'analyze', 'eveything', 'realize', 'great', 'movie.Everyone', 'great', 'movie', 'Not', 'suprise', 'really', 'am', 'swallowing', 'lot', 'pride', 'saying', 'Tom', 'Hank', 'great', 'am', 'NOT', 'biggest', 'fan', 'course', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'great', 'costumes', 'are', 'also', 'exceptionaly', 'well', 'done', 'lighting', 'good', 'one', 'thing', 'made', 'Godfather', 'plot', 'very', 'interesting', 'sort', 'glorifies', 'mob', 'brow', 'beats', 'same', 'time', 'element', 'Godfather.The', 'bottomline', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Spider-Man', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'etc', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'mature', 'teen', 'adult', 'can', 'go', 'see', 'not', 'be', 'worried', 'kiddie', 'elements', 'Well', 'movie.One', 'Thing', 'may', 'want', 'know', '*WHAT', 'PERDITION', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Perdition', 'was', 'saw', 'previe', 'guide', 'said', 'meant', 'eternal', 'Hell', 'title', 'great', 'sort', 'subject', 'conversation.Can', 'movie', 'have', 'impact', 'Godfather', 'Can', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Godfather', 'Will', 'be', 'fun', 'Will', 'be', 'Oscar-contender', 'Well', 'all', 'questions', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'rest', 'one', 'way', 'ant', 'rate', 'will', 'see', 'theaters', 'July', '12th', 'when', 'nationwide']",N/A

Well, lesson learned: don't believe everything you read or hear about a movie. This movie deserves accolades and applause for being one of the best movies made last year.""Road To Perdition"" is the story of a man with a mission to avenge the death of his wife and son, all the while reconnecting to the remaining son he never knew. Tom Hanks leads this all-star cast, Jude Law, Stanley Tucci, Jennifer Jason  Leigh, and including the amazing Paul Newman who plays his role with dignity. Some people claim they can't see Hanks as a gangster, but he plays his role with both reserve and dignity. He is an actor, first and foremost, and he can carry off any role he plays.But let's get to the real reason this film is amazing. First the script. Bringing back a 30's gangster drama, with a strong emphasis on drama. Sure there is a lot of killing and death in the film, but it is vital and relevant to the plot. It's a very strong story, as Hanks needs to do what he needs to do to carry out his new mission in life. From the moment the film opens to the closing credits, it's strong and real.Some people complain about the pacing. While it is slow, it is the characters that drive it that speed, and spending every second with them is an amazing experience. If you want a shoot 'em up, crash and dash movie, move on: this movie isn't for you.The true star of the film, though, is the incredible direction of Sam Mendes, and the absolutely beautiful cinematography. This is a film to be cherished, relished like a fine wine. Each scene is perfectly crafted to convey its purpose and meaning to the highest degree. It almost seems like you can watch each frame with the sound off, and it still resounds with strong emotional impact.

Tom Hanks, like Robin Williams, joins the dark side by playing a 1930's mafia hitman who happens to be very good at and very well respected for his chosen profession.  Hanks brings a human face to an otherwise inhuman profession, allowing the audience to see both sides of the coin: a cold-blooded killer on one hand, and a loving family man on the other.When Hanks' son witnesses a murder he is involved in, he finds himself betrayed by the very people (Paul Newman) he had given his loyalty to.  On the run from the mafia and pursued by a creepy assassin (Jude Law), Hanks is forced to choose between safety and vengeance against those who have turned on him.Paul Newman delivers a high-caliber performance as the mob boss that Hanks works for.  Like Hanks, Newman finds himself struggling with inner turmoil between the ruthlessness required to run his organization, and the human emotions that tear at him in carrying out the decisions he faces.  I can't think of anyone who would have fit this role better than Newman and his performance is incredible.Jude Law takes on the role of a very creepy and very cold-blooded assassin hired to track down and eliminate Hanks.

Remember how delicious it looked, and you knew, from the packaging, that it must be tasty and you would be working on it for a good two weeks?  And then remember how, when you bit into the rabbit and found out the stupid thing was hollow, you thought that Someone Up There must be mocking your trivial existence?  Sam Mendes&#65533; (&#65533;American Beauty&#65533;) new film &#65533;Road to Perdition,&#65533; based on the graphic novel of the same name, manages to illicit the same feelings &#65533; and that&#65533;s about the only feeling it creates.Paul Newman is an Irish mob boss in a smaller Illinois town in 1931, part of Al Capone&#65533;s crumbling empire (remember, Kevin Costner put him in jail by now).  Tom Hanks is one of his hit men, whose luckless son (newcomer Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses Hanks killing someone.  When Newman&#65533;s jealous son, played by Daniel Craig, decides to protect his name by killing Hanks&#65533; family, Hanks and his surviving son take off on a road trip (to, you guessed it, Perdition, Illinois), hoping to convince the mob bosses in Chicago and his hometown to let him execute Newman&#65533;s kid.So the whole story is about revenge.  Granted, Shakespeare did pretty well with that subject, but traditionally, it doesn&#65533;t allow for much character development, and less emotion, other than &#65533;we got the bad guys!  Yippee!&#65533;  This is &#65533;Road&#65533;s&#65533; biggest flaw: the plot, when all else is stripped away, is pencil-thin and the characters ultimately two-dimensional.  Hanks and Newman both turn in stellar performances, but their characters aren&#65533;t as memorable Hoechlin&#65533;s, simply because he was given more of a chance to develop and show a range of human emotions.  And, all of them are beaten out by Jude Law, who manages to turn a bit-character into the most memorable one in the film.Like last year&#65533;s &#65533;A Beautiful Mind,&#65533; &#65533;Road to Perdition&#65533; smacks of Oscar grooming.  With top-notch directors like Mendes, cinematographers like Conrad Hall, and actors like Hanks and Newman, it&#65533;s hard to go wrong, but like that chocolate bunny, there just isn&#65533;t anything underneath the exoskeleton.  Whether it&#65533;s because the plot was thin (there are repeated ideas of &#65533;family,&#65533; but &#65533;The Godfather&#65533; blew &#65533;RTP&#65533; out of the water on that count) or a poor script for the main actors, the film ultimately sinks under its own weight.  Add to that a heavy-handed voiceover at the end telling you exactly how to feel (unlike the appropriately ambiguous one in &#65533;American Beauty,&#65533;) and you&#65533;ve got a movie for the masses and the Academy, but thinking filmgoers looking for that solid chocolate will have to look somewhere else.  &#65533;Road to Perdition&#65533; is beautiful and tasty, but it&#65533;s all fluff and style with zero in the substance department.Final Grade: D",2,"Gorgeous, Oscar-Groomed, and Hollow as Can Be",1026950400,"07 18, 2002",2002,3088,"['Do', 'remember', 'Easters', 'youth', 'when', 'discovered', 'gigantic', 'gold-wrapped', 'chocolate', 'rabbit', 'sitting', 'basket', 'Remember', 'how', 'delicious', 'looked', 'knew', 'packaging', 'must', 'be', 'tasty', 'would', 'be', 'working', 'good', 'two', 'weeks', 'then', 'remember', 'how', 'when', 'bit', 'rabbit', 'found', 'stupid', 'thing', 'was', 'hollow', 'thought', 'Someone', 'Up', 'must', 'be', 'mocking', 'trivial', 'existence', 'Sam', 'Mendes', '65533', '65533', 'American', 'Beauty', '65533', 'new', 'film', '65533', 'Road', 'Perdition', '65533', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'illicit', 'same', 'feelings', '65533', '65533', 's', 'only', 'feeling', 'Newman', 'Irish', 'mob', 'boss', 'smaller', 'Illinois', 'town', '1931', 'part', 'Al', 'Capone', '65533', 's', 'crumbling', 'empire', 'remember', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'put', 'jail', 'now', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'one', 'hit', 'men', 'luckless', 'son', 'newcomer', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'Hanks', 'killing', 'someone', 'When', 'Newman', '65533', 'jealous', 'son', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'protect', 'name', 'killing', 'Hanks', '65533', 'family', 'Hanks', 'surviving', 'son', 'take', 'off', 'road', 'trip', 'guessed', 'Perdition', 'Illinois', 'hoping', 'convince', 'mob', 'bosses', 'Chicago', 'hometown', 'let', 'execute', 'Newman', '65533', 'kid.So', 'whole', 'story', 'revenge', 'Granted', 'Shakespeare', 'did', 'pretty', 'well', 'subject', 'traditionally', '65533', 't', 'allow', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'less', 'emotion', 'other', '65533', 'got', 'bad', 'guys', 'Yippee', '65533', '65533', 'Road', '65533', 's', '65533', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'plot', 'when', 'else', 'stripped', 'away', 'pencil-thin', 'characters', 'ultimately', 'two-dimensional', 'Hanks', 'Newman', 'turn', 'stellar', 'performances', 'characters', 'aren', '65533', 'memorable', 'Hoechlin', '65533', 's', 'simply', 'was', 'given', 'more', 'chance', 'develop', 'show', 'range', 'human', 'emotions', 'are', 'beaten', 'out', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'turn', 'bit-character', 'most', 'memorable', 'one', 'film.Like', 'last', 'year', '65533', 's', '65533', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', '65533', '65533', 'Road', 'Perdition', '65533', 'smacks', 'Oscar', 'grooming', 'top-notch', 'directors', 'Mendes', 'cinematographers', 'Conrad', 'Hall', 'actors', 'Hanks', 'Newman', '65533', 's', 'hard', 'go', 'wrong', 'chocolate', 'bunny', 'just', 'isn', '65533', 't', 'anything', 'exoskeleton', '65533', 's', 'plot', 'was', 'thin', 'are', 'repeated', 'ideas', '65533', 'family', '65533', '65533', 'Godfather', '65533', 'blew', '65533', 'RTP', '65533', 'water', 'count', 'poor', 'script', 'main', 'actors', 'film', 'ultimately', 'own', 'weight', 'Add', 'heavy-handed', 'voiceover', 'end', 'telling', 'exactly', 'how', 'feel', 'appropriately', 'ambiguous', 'one', '65533', 'American', 'Beauty', '65533', '65533', 've', 'got', 'movie', 'masses', 'Academy', 'thinking', 'filmgoers', 'looking', 'solid', 'chocolate', 'will', 'have', 'look', 'somewhere', 'else', '65533', 'Road', 'Perdition', '65533', 'beautiful', 'tasty', '65533', 's', 'fluff', 'style', 'zero', 'substance', 'department.Final', 'Grade', 'D']",N/A

Michael Sullivan (Hanks) is the right-hand man for crime boss John Rooney, played superbly by veteran actor Paul Newman.  But when Sullivan's young son Michael Jr., played by Tyler Hoechlin, witnesses one of his father's hits, he must choose between his real family and his crime family.Upon finding out that Sullivan's son witnessed the hit, Rooney's son Connor, played by Daniel Craig, has Sullivan's wife Annie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and son Peter (Liam Athen) killed.  This fills Michael with rage and revenge against his former crime family, but also fills him with a new-found sense of love and responsibility for his son Michael Jr.The acting throughout the film is excellent.  Hanks turns in one of his best acting performances as Sullivan, while timeless Paul Newman is wonderful as John Rooney.  Jude Law is also a standout as Maguire, a chilling hit man/photographer.

I'll go on about all of the top-notch acting, cinemetogaraghy, production design, music, etc., but the point here is to see it.I'm not going to talk about the plot that much, but if you look at the movie poster, you should be able to at least guess most of it right there. Anyway, the acting is the best I've seen this whole year, with stellar performances by Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, and Daniel Craig. The scenes between Tom Hanks and Paul Newman were great. Of course, it's always great to see two phenomonal actors on-screen together. More importantly, the chemistry between Tom Hanks and Tyler Hoechlin (his son in the movie) is wonderful.The production design is also very noteworthy. Throughout the movie, we are filled with the lush cityscape(s) of 1931. (If you have seen The Untouchables, the set desgin is a bit like that, but stepped up a notch.) We also are taken in to speakeasies, mob warehouses, and other landmarks of a 1931 era city, all rendered in exact detail as far as I can tell. The cinemetogarahy is exactly on the same level as the production design, showing in great exactness the landscape of cities in 1931. The music is also great, giving an epic, but sad, look at the movie.For those of you who are looking for a big gangster action movie, look elsewhere. Although there is some shooting, (most of which is very bloody/gruesome) this is NOT the movie for action fans.All in all: Road to Perdition is a modern masterpiece, complete with phenomonal acting, great music, fantastic production design, and heart-wrenching drama.

The third relationship is that between Hanks' character and his son, who, as it turns out, wants nothing more than to earn his father's approval.Hanks' son puts everything in jeopordy when he witnesses three gangland murders at the hands of his father and his twisted uncle.  His uncle, who is stirred by envy and contempt for his adopted brother, takes matters into his own hands and murders one of Hanks' sons and his wife, thinking it was the boy who saw the killing. Oddly enough, he kills the wrong boy, leaving the actual witness alive and at the mercy of his father who now must make a life determining decision.As things turn out, Hanks faces a desperate situation, one in which he is forced to choose his own son over his father, his career, and quite possibly his own life. Likewise,  Paul Newman's character is forced to choose his own blood over that which is right and justifiable, opting instead to make a  dishonorable and unfathomable deed.The course takes Hanks and his son on a road trip in hopes of escaping Newman's wrath and a pyschotic assasin(Jude Law) who is hot on their trail.It is on this road trip that we the line of morality and loyalty that runs deep in every family, however thin it may seem at times.  We see a father(Hanks) who doesn't know how to show his son affection and opts instead to demonstrate his love through his protection for the boy.We also get to see the twisted lines of self-reflected morality from some of the key characters; for instance, Newman states at one point to Hanks(referring to those in organized crime), ""One thing's certain: none of us will ever see heaven.""  It's as if both Hanks and Newman's characters are acting like robots, having long since lost any hope of changing their lives and their ways. Perhaps Hanks' valiant road trip with his son is his last chance at redemption? Food for thought.I truly believe this to be one of the best films shown in 2002.

There are days, these days, when Hanks might be the only honest person left in the Western world.He's too good for the role of Sullivan, a family hit man who works for &quot;Mr. Rooney&quot;, the latter played with great depth by an appropriately wizened Paul Newman. Picture Gabriel Byrne, dressed for &quot;Miller's Crossing&quot;, in Tom's place, and you have the needed twist. And yet, such is the lovability factor of Hanks, he'd be sadly missed.The &quot;Perdition&quot; story's undertow goes essentially like this: Your puppy is fine - he's been sent, along with a Gladstone bag of money, to live on a particularly desirable and believable, midwestern pre-vinyl  farm.",3,Hanks is unbelievably too honest in this role,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,1100,"['quot', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'quot', 'great', 'cast', 'good', 'script', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'ironically', 'expensive', 'Depression', '1931', 'setting', 'oddly', 'place', 'post-9/11', 'production', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'fresh', 'remarkable', 'HBO', 'production', 'quot', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'quot', 'seemed', 'nudge', 'quot', 'Perdition', 'quot', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'territory', 'sheer', 'resonance', 'transportable', 'good-guy', 'character', 'are', 'days', 'days', 'when', 'Hanks', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'honest', 'person', 'left', 'Western', 'world.He', 'too', 'good', 'role', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'hit', 'man', 'who', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'quot', 'latter', 'played', 'great', 'depth', 'appropriately', 'wizened', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Picture', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'dressed', 'quot', 'Miller', 'Crossing', 'quot', 'Tom', 'place', 'have', 'needed', 'twist', 'yet', 'such', 'lovability', 'factor', 'Hanks', ""'d"", 'be', 'sadly', 'missed.The', 'quot', 'Perdition', 'quot', 'story', 'undertow', 'essentially', 'puppy', 'fine', 'been', 'sent', 'Gladstone', 'bag', 'money', 'live', 'particularly', 'desirable', 'believable', 'midwestern', 'pre-vinyl', 'farm']",N/A

Besides, it rains so much in this film that it would've made her look like a wet doggie.It's 1931, and Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, an enforcer working for crime family head John Rooney (Paul Newman). Though Rooney has an adult son, Connor (Daniel Craig), he regards Michael with the affection reserved for the son he wishes he'd had. Sullivan himself has a wife and two boys. In the film's first half-hour, Connor botches a job assigned to him and Michael by the elder Rooney. In the aftermath of the debacle, Connor kills Michael's wife and his youngest (and favorite) son for reasons too complicated to explain here. For the remainder of the film, Sullivan goes on the lam with Michael, Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) seeking revenge against Connor while evading a hit man named Maguire (Jude Law) reluctantly hired by John Rooney to pre-empt the reprisal slaying of his own badly behaved offspring.Those who are turned off by ROAD TO PERDITION because of the bloody deeds performed by Hollywood Good Fella Hanks, akin to watching Jimmy Stewart in the role of someone who kicks puppies, are perhaps missing the point. This is a powerful tale of the dynamic that exists between fathers and sons: John and Connor, Michael and Michael, Jr., and John and Michael. This is a Guy Story to be sure. Indeed, in the entire film there's no female lead worth mentioning and very little softness. Much of the magnificent cinematography is done in the dark, brooding atmospheres that one could expect in the Male's Cave. That's not to say that there's no humor. There's a sequence of scenes depicting the young Sullivan's mastering of driving skills that, in the context of the storyline, is positively priceless.Early on, Newman, the mega-star of yesterday, and Hanks, the mega-star of today, play a piano duet (for real). But the sentimental favorite of ROAD TO PERDITION has to be the former, and I foresee a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Newman's blue eyes continue to shine out of a face that age (and perhaps cosmetic surgery) has only made more striking. Moreover, Paul's Rooney expresses more raw emotion in his relationship with his son than Tom's Sullivan can manage in his. Perhaps this was an intentional part of the script, or perhaps it's a reflection of the accomplished old pro that Newman is and Hanks has yet to be. And Law is especially good as the sinister and creepy Maguire whose hits provide fodder for his day job.I liked this film a lot because it focuses on the nature of the father/son relationship, something which Tinseltown usually ignores.

I immediatley noticed that camera shots in this movie reminded me of a comic book.  It wasn't just because of the subject matter that it was remniscient of a comic book.  The camera angles the director used were all revealing and unique.  I thought that the graphic novel must have helped the director out alot.  The story itself follows an Irish crime family that is internally falling apart.  This is mostly due to the leader's son named Connor Rooney, who kills people left and right without ryhme or reason.  Michael Sullivan, played by Tom Hanks, is a hitman working for the senior Rooney, superbly cast and played by Paul Newman, who's young son witnesses a murder by Connor and is forced to escape after finding his wife and other son murdered in his house.  The two Sullivan's ride across the country robbing banks to make money while Michael tries to avoid getting killed by the hitman, played smartly by Jude Law, and avenge his wife and child's death.  The conflicts within the story make for some great action and suspense as well as some emotionally moving moments.  The ending is just great.  It is a sad ending but it is well deserved considering the build-up.  The director did an excellent job and all the actors gave powerful performances.

""Road to Perdition"" (2002) comes to us from director Sam Mendes, the man who brought us ""American Beauty"" (1999).  The story ""Road to Perdition"" originally existed as a graphic novel from author Max Allan Collins, and from this work it was adapted into a screenplay by David Self.The film is set during the Great Depression Era, about 1931.  Primarily shot in Chicago, Illinois, the film adaptation is highly noted because it gains emotional connection to audiences by imagery, where most films do this through dialog. An underlying theme emerging throughout the movie deals with the nature of father/son relationships. The cinematographer, Conrad Hall, won an Academy Award for his work on this film praising the creation of vitality through visual symbolism.Though Irish Mob Boss John Rooney has a biological son, the violent and irrational Connor, he seems to prefer his orphan son, Michael Sullivan, Sr., a contributing factor to the madness that drives Connor to murder fellow mobster Finn McGovern during a meeting-gone-sour. This lapse in judgement on Connor's part leaves Michael with no choice but to protect himself/his family by shooting all McGovern's men who were present during the murder to prevent retaliation.Sullivan discovers that his son, Michael Jr., witnessed the blood bath but swears him to silence. Despite Sullivan's loyalty, Connor takes matters into his own hands for covering his tracks. After sending Sullivan to certain death, Connor kills Sullivan's wife and son, Anne and Peter, believing Peter is Michael Jr., the witness. Sullivan and his son, Michael Jr., flee to Chicago where they may seek out Al Capone and means of revenge against Connor. Sullivan's plans are foiled when Frank Nitti, one of Capone's men, informs on Sullivan to his former boss, John Rooney.To clean up loose ends, Nitti is instructed to hire hit-man Harlen Maguire to ""off"" Sullivan, but when the planned murder fails, Sullivan turns his sights toward squeezing the mob by robbing their money-laundering banks with the help of his son, Michael Jr., driving get-away.  When Sullivan steals the ledgers from mob accountant Alexander Rance, he walks into a trap but makes it out with a wounded shoulder.An elderly couple take Michael and his son in for a time as Michael's should heals. During this time, the father and son not only grow closer but also learn of the theft Connor has committed against his father from the ledgers. When Sullivan outs the embezzlement, Rooney is unsurprised. Sullivan sees that Connor will only be found by force, so he guns down all of Rooney's men, including Rooney, and elicits Connor's whereabouts from Nitti.The remainder of the film is concerned with the ultimate fates of Connor, Michael, and Maguire... And I wouldn't dare spoil it.I bought this movie as a gift for my brother, its one of his favorite movies.  I'd venture to say its more enjoyed by men than women, but only because the subject explores more of a gangster-guns-father-son genre.  Its a very well done movie and the actors are phenomenal, and it gives a realistic feeling often lost in these sorts of movies.

Michael Sullivan is an honorable man and is trying to instill those values into his children, Michael Jr. and Peter, prayers at dinner, an admonition not to play dice. He goes off  to work everyday and provides for his family. Unfortunately, Michael Sullivan makes a living in a dishonorable profession, he's a gangster during prohibition. And a rather good one at that, he's the right hand man, enforcer for Paul Newman's mob boss, John Rooney.Daniel Craig is Conner Rooney, John Rooney's biological son. Hanks' Michael Sullivan Sr is more of a son to the elder Rooney and the resentment seethes from Conner as he watches his father play the piano with Sullivan, and later we see how Rooney Sr berates Connor and humiliates him in front of Rooney Sr's lieutenants. When Michael Jr's curiosity gets the better of him and he follows his father to ""work"" where he witnesses his father committing a murder, when Michael is discovered it gives Conner an excuse to vent his rage towards Michael Sullivan by killing his family. After which Hanks' Michael Sullivan uses all the tools and skills at his disposal to avenge his family's murder to reach a conclusion that defies expectations and most clich&eacute;s.The acting is all around excellent, from Paul Newman's Oscar nominated performance as John Rooney. The first scene with Newman in it could be an entreaty to his fans when he says, ""who's got a hug for lonely old man,"" only later do we learn of the ruthlessness of Rooney. Tom Hanks is surprising in this role, Michael Sullivan is essentially a hitman and Hanks plays to type, he may not be the smartest but he is good in his job. A pre-almost everything else Daniel Craig gives a subtle performance as Connor Rooney, who goes from ruthless ambition to a petulant adolescent trying to please his father but always falling short. Jude Law turns in an excellent performance letting himself look and be ugly as Maguire, a death photographer who if his subject isn't quite dead isn't above finishing off the job. Stanley Tucci turns in a nice role as a fictionalized Frank Nitti from Capone's Chicago mob.Based on a graphic novel by Max Collins, The Road to Perdition stays true to graphic novel origins. A lot of the shots are taken right from the pages of the graphic novel and it doesn't look gimmicky, as a matter of fact it sets the tone for the nostalgic feeling the fictional storyteller is telling, the story of his father. It also gives the movie a somewhat unique feel and in certain cases makes it a more interesting movie. For example, when Sullivan kills Paul Newman the scene is shot from the far end of a rainy street and all you see is the flash of the machine gun out of the darkness as Newman's bodyguards fall like the rain around him.Bonus Features: There are a ton of bonus features in this DVD. The usual director's commentary, deleted scenes, and making of documentary.

That seems to be very true as this 1930's era gangster melodrama starts to unfold. It is a convoluted story of two sets of fathers and sons.Tom Hanks (playing against his usual Jimmy Stewart persona) is Michael Sullivan, a hitman for the irish mob.One night while he's out on a job, his stowaway son, Michael Jr.(Tyler Hoechlin)witnesses a killing. In the eyes of the mob, Sullivan and his whole family must pay the ultimate price.On the other side of the equation is the Mob's patriarical boss (masterfully played by Paul Newman) and his own hateful, grown son(Daniel Craig), who has started all this trouble.Both fathers must now protect their sons (physically and spiritually). Both fathers must try to kill their adversaries and their kin.This film starts out as a story about violence and distruction, but in the end it becomes a tale of redemption as the doomed, elder Sullivan attempts to put his son on on the right path.Director, Sam Mendes (of American Beauty fame) has masterfully crafted a morality tale (written by Max Allen Collins & Richard Piers Raynor) that seems to touch all emotions.Everyone in this cast is at the top of their craft.Tom Hanks is wonderful in his reserved and studied reading of the hitman/father. Paul Neuman gives one of the best performances of his career as the torn mob boss.Juvenile actor, Tyler Hoechlin more then holds his own among these award winning actors.Kudos also for the supporting role from Jude Law, who gives a scary peformance as a psychotic photographer/killer on Sullivan's tail.This movie is just so well done in every way.The cinematography of this film is fantastic. The late Conrad L. Hall, won the Oscar in Cinematography for this picture and he roundly deserved it. It is a amazing looking movie (check out the beautiful, yet violent scene, where Hanks finally confronts Newman in the rain).Also well done are the costumes, set design and art direction.They totally complete this artful film.Why this movie was pretty much ignored by the Motion Picture Academy is beyond me. This film is definitely Oscar calibur material in my eyes.The DVD for this film is well done with both a clear picture and sound. There are plenty of extras including a HBO 'Making of' documentry, a commentary track and deleted scenes.

However, all the luxuries have a price that the oldest of the two sons discovers during one night when he shadows his father as he is carrying out the work assigned to him by his boss John Rooney (Paul Newman).  This event becomes traumatizing for Michael Sullivan, Jr. and it leads to more bloodshed.  The violence draws the son closer to his father and as they get closer, the father becomes aware of his own path in life, but can he save his sons' path to eternal damnation (i.e., perdition)?  Road to Perdition uses cunning cinematography that enhances the moments of crucial significance in the story.  Combined with the outstanding cast, the director expands the texture of the film with a genuine touch of the 1930s and human ambiguity.

Tom Hanks plays a dull, lifeless man who is barely affected when his wife and son are slaughtered. Not that he should be all that surprised when he is, in fact, part of the mafia where things of this nature occur frequently. His surviving son doesn't show much remorse either even though we're led to think of him as a 'good' kid. By the middle of the film, while they're on the run from the bad people, we're shown the two of them bonding and some joking at the most inappropriate times and I couldn't help but to shake my head when I was apparently expected to laugh and feel. There were such ridiculous lines thrown in meant to amuse us and this was definitely not the place for them to try and be witty. Then came the ending (eventually) where I DID laugh, though obviously not the director's intention. Somehow, after enduring hours of boredom, we're expected to CARE when the father gets what he so deserves (after all he does murder for a living)and to feel sorry for his equally unfeeling son as he cries out to him?

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[3, 5]","I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting when I chose to watch this movie, other than what is normally an excellent performance by Tom Hanks, which he did deliver, as usual, in what is an extremely atypical type of role for him.  Rarely will you see Tom Hanks play one of the &quot;bad&quot; guys, but in the end, he's a bad guy who loves his family.  Overall though, this film just doesn't live up to its potential, failing to grab the viewer and compel you to the character or characters.  Yes, you do feel for the character and the losses he must endure, but it's just not a compelling story.As is usual for Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, they both deliver exceptional performances, despite a weak story.  Jennifer Jason Leigh's role in the film is so minor as to hardly be noticed.  Jude Law delivers a very good performance in this film, which is par for the course for him.  Tyler Hoechlin's performance is quite admirable for a young actor.Highly acclaimed &quot;American Beauty&quot; director, Sam Mendes led the reigns on this film and sets a beautiful tone for the film, which is thematically rich with the exception of the story itself which I found lacking.  The score for the film is &quot;dead on&quot; for the film.The premise:Tom Hanks stars as Mike Sullivan, devoted family man with his wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and two children Mike Jr. and Peter.  Along with being the devoted family man, Mike Sullivan is an Irish mafia hit man whose family, led by John Rooney (Paul Newman) has very close ties to Al Capone.One evening, young Mike Jr. decides that he &quot;must&quot; find out what his father actually does for a living so he stows away in the trunk of his father's car.  On that rainy night, he finds out in the worse way what his father does as he watches him and Conner Rooney (Daniel Craig) murder three men.  He's so shocked by what he's just seen he makes a noise and his father quickly finds him.As much as his father tries to tell him everything is going to be okay and to forget about what he's seen, Conner Rooney isn't going to let them just forget about and orders Mike Sullivan murdered and sees to killing his wife and children himself.  Fortunately for Mike Jr. he's not at home when Conner Rooney murders his mother and brother.What follows from there is a &quot;generally&quot; entertaining but rarely captivating story as Mike Sullivan and his son are attempting to allude Maguire (Jude Law) whose been sent to kill them and at the same time, find a way to get to Conner Rooney to avenge the death of his wife and youngest son.I would recommend this movie as a rental.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:- Deleted Scenes- HBO's &quot;Making of&quot; Documentary- Feature Commentary with Director Sam Mendes- Production Notes- Photo Gallery",3,Road to Perdition - A &quot;fairly&quot; decent film!,1067126400,"10 26, 2003",2003,2773,"[""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'when', 'chose', 'watch', 'movie', 'other', 'what', 'normally', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'did', 'deliver', 'usual', 'what', 'extremely', 'atypical', 'type', 'role', 'Rarely', 'will', 'see', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'play', 'one', 'quot', 'bad', 'quot', 'guys', 'end', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'family', 'Overall', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'failing', 'grab', 'viewer', 'compel', 'character', 'characters', 'Yes', 'do', 'feel', 'character', 'losses', 'must', 'endure', 'just', 'not', 'compelling', 'story.As', 'usual', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'deliver', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'weak', 'story', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'role', 'film', 'so', 'minor', 'hardly', 'be', 'noticed', 'Jude', 'Law', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'film', 'par', 'course', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'performance', 'quite', 'admirable', 'young', 'actor.Highly', 'acclaimed', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'led', 'reigns', 'film', 'beautiful', 'tone', 'film', 'thematically', 'rich', 'exception', 'story', 'found', 'lacking', 'score', 'film', 'quot', 'dead', 'quot', 'film.The', 'premise', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Mike', 'Sullivan', 'devoted', 'family', 'man', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'two', 'children', 'Mike', 'Jr.', 'Peter', 'being', 'devoted', 'family', 'man', 'Mike', 'Sullivan', 'Irish', 'mafia', 'hit', 'man', 'family', 'led', 'John', 'Rooney', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'very', 'close', 'ties', 'Al', 'Capone.One', 'evening', 'young', 'Mike', 'Jr.', 'quot', 'must', 'quot', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'father', 'actually', 'living', 'so', 'away', 'trunk', 'father', 'car', 'rainy', 'night', 'out', 'worse', 'way', 'what', 'father', 'Conner', 'Rooney', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'murder', 'three', 'men', 'so', 'shocked', 'what', 'just', 'seen', 'noise', 'father', 'quickly', 'him.As', 'much', 'father', 'tries', 'tell', 'everything', 'going', 'be', 'okay', 'forget', 'what', 'seen', 'Conner', 'Rooney', ""n't"", 'going', 'let', 'just', 'forget', 'about', 'orders', 'Mike', 'Sullivan', 'murdered', 'sees', 'killing', 'wife', 'children', 'Fortunately', 'Mike', 'Jr.', 'not', 'home', 'when', 'Conner', 'Rooney', 'mother', 'brother.What', 'quot', 'generally', 'quot', 'entertaining', 'rarely', 'captivating', 'story', 'Mike', 'Sullivan', 'son', 'are', 'attempting', 'allude', 'Maguire', 'Jude', 'Law', 'been', 'sent', 'kill', 'same', 'time', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'Conner', 'Rooney', 'avenge', 'death', 'wife', 'youngest', 'son.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'rental', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', 'Deleted', 'Scenes-', 'HBO', 'quot', 'Making', 'quot', 'Documentary-', 'Feature', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Mendes-', 'Production', 'Notes-', 'Photo', 'Gallery']",N/A

Bernabo,"[2, 2]","The publicity for ""Road to Perdition"" is all about actors Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, but it did not take long into this film for me to decide the two stars are cinematographer Conrad Hall and composer Thomas Newman.  Both are deservedly up for Oscars for this 2002 film because ""Road to Perdition"" is ultimately pictures and music.  Hall died last month and won his second Oscar for his previous film, ""American Beauty,"" and it will be interesting to see how those two factors affect the voters, but this is a gorgeous film.  Almost as strong is the music by Thomas Newman, although the piano duet played by Hanks and Paul Newman was written by John Williams.  It is not surprising that several of the pivotal scenes of the film are without dialogue, or with the spoken words muted, because the performances are etched more by visuals than words (and the standout performance of the film is Jude Law).The film is based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner, which was clearly inspired by the epic Japanese manga ""Lone Wolf & Cub"" by Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima, the final volume of which was just published in the United States. The parallels are in general terms: a skilled assassin forced to flee with his son, but planning vengeance.  Instead of feudal Japan the story is set in the Great Depression in and around Chicago.  However, while ""Lone Wolf & Cub"" provides the essential premise of the film the end game is decidedly different (think John Wayne's final film ""The Shootist"").  The final pivotal scene of ""The Road to Perdition"" represents the film perfectly: I knew what was going to happen but it was photographed beautifully.  Again, you might be seeing Tom Hanks, but you are thinking Conrad Hall.

597901,AT1GMH2UHYROT,B00005JLBQ,Lee DeWald,"[6, 8]","Even now, I don't really know how to sum up this movie.  All I knew before I went to see it was that 1) it featured Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors; 2) people were raving that it was Paul Newman's best performance in years; and 3) that it was an excellent movie, one worth looking into.  But now that I have actually seen it, now that I have had the great fortune to sit through two hours of such an engrossing movie, all I can find to say is this: what an incredibly well-done piece of work.Tom Hanks plays the character of Michael Sullivan, a hit-man of sorts of who works for John Rooney (played startlingly well by Paul Newman).  The story travels at a very leisurely pace, until Sullivan, along with Rooney's son, silence a man who was speaking out against Rooney.  In what should be just another day at the office turns out to be the key turning point in the film.  Seconds after Sullivan and his partner-in-crime do their dirty work, it is discovered that Sullivan's son, also named Michael, saw the whole thing.  Rooney and his son are doubtful that young Michael will be able to keep this dark secret under wraps, so Rooney orders Sullivan's family to be murdered.  This sets the rest of the movie in motion - Sullivan and his son skip town so as to avoid the rest of Rooney's wrath.Tom Hanks, again, serves up another great performance.  He is stiffer than a board at first, but as the movie opens up, so does his character, making his transformation from cold-hearted gunman to a guy just trying to protect what little he has left all the more convincing.  You've never quite seen Hanks like this before, and I applaud him for stepping out of his familiar ""the guy everybody loves"" role.  Paul Newman is electric - the screen crackles with energy every time he is on screen.  His eyes, his barely-controlled rage, his suffering; I can see why people claim that this is his most riveting character portrayal in years.  Jude Law, a photographer who likes to ""shoot the dead"" is also a stand-out.  He's just creepy enough, and just weasel-like enough, to make you both fear and hate him.  Everyone points out that Hanks and Newman are great, but many also fail to point out just what a talented actor they found in Law.Sam Mendes, who also directed the standout movie ""American Beauty,"" does another fine job behind the camera here.  There are a number of shots he took that reminded me of ""American Beauty,"" and that's not necessarily a bad thing, since I really like that movie.  The cinematographer is also wonderful - from the gray and black hues that wash over the screen, to the way the rain cascades down windows and reflects onto characters' faces and walls, to the way candles light up a room, this movie is simply gorgeous to look at.  And I can't forget Thomas Newman, who impresses me more and more with each score that he produces.  He is developing quite a reputation for himself, with such great scores for ""American Beauty"" and ""The Green Mile.""  The score he produced for this film is terrific, and it has all the trademark Newman aspects in it.I really can't say more about this movie without giving it away.  I liked this movie a lot more than I thought I would - there were scary elements, there was humor, there was a heartwarming portrayal of father-son relationships.  This is one movie that needs to be seen to be appreciated.Do yourself a favor and check out ""Road to Perdition.""

597902,A1YVPBDG2OFMD2,B00005JLBQ,Leif Sheppard,"[8, 10]","""Road to Perdition"" proved that the success director Sam Mendes enjoyed with his first feature, ""American Beauty"", wasn't a fluke. Based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, the film follows the story of a Depression-era enforcer working for the local Irish mob boss and his relationship with his son after a devastatingly tragic series of events. Cinematographer Conrad Hall won an Academy Award for his work on this film, and once seen, one can hardly argue he didn't earn it. Since there are a multitude of reviews detailing the virtues of the film itself, for the purposes of brevity I'll focus on the technical aspects of the Blu-Ray release.Paramount has provided an absolutely perfect transfer of this film for its debut on Blu-Ray. Take note that the cinematography is intentionally dark and somewhat grainy, so this won't have the same perfectly clean image as a film rife with CGI or animation (i.e. ""Avatar"" or any Pixar film). The transfer is extremely sharp on detail and aids in the overall beauty of the film, whilst still remaining entirely faithful to the original intentions of the director and cinematographer. I've often been impressed with the care Paramount gives to its catalog titles, and this one is no different.The Blu-Ray is presented in a single disc version with seven special features (three of which are exclusive to the Blu). The audio tracks include a 5.1 English DTS-HD master audio track and two 5.1 Dolby Digital tracks in French and Spanish. Subtitles are also included in English, French, or Spanish. There are no pre-menu trailers on the disc. The special features include:1) ""Introduction by Director Sam Mendes"" (1:18) [HD] - Brief opening words from Mendes, who highlights the exquisite cinematography and says a few gracious words about the late Conrad Hall.2) ""A Cinematic Life: The Art and Influence of Conrad Hall"" (26:39) [HD] - The jewel of the two new special features included with the Blu, this is an outstanding piece covering the illustrious career of Hall, which not only contains interesting bits about his work but also sheds a little light on the man behind the camera. There are plenty of expressive photographs and film clips, as well as copious interviews with other crew members that worked with Hall as well as his own son (who is also a cinematographer). The last few minutes focus especially on ""Road to Perdition"".3) ""The Library: A Further Exploration of the World of Road to Perdition"" [HD] - This is a sort of informative, interactive photo gallery that contains text covering historical curiosities of the era and information about the production of the film. It's split into four sections: ""Crime Scene Portraits"", ""Real World Organized Crime"", ""News Stories of the Day"", and ""Inspiration & Adaptation"". There was great effort placed into this and as a result it's one of the better photo galleries I've seen on Blu - though the animated menus get more than a little obnoxious after a few minutes.4) ""Deleted Scenes"" (22:16) [SD] - A selection of eleven deleted scenes with optional commentary by Mendes. Nothing new is included here, all of these were available on the original DVD release.5) ""The Making of Road to Perdition"" (25:04) [SD] - This was also included on the original DVD release and functions as a standard, by-the-numbers making-of piece. There's some interesting stuff here, but also plenty of clips from the film (owing to its origins as a promotional piece).6) Theatrical Trailer (2:52) [HD]7) Feature-Length Film Commentary with Sam Mendes""Road to Perdition"" is a modern masterpiece with an incredibly talented cast, a profoundly moving story, and hauntingly beautiful cinematography. At least once a year I pour myself a glass of wine, settle into my recliner, and let this film wash over me for the next two hours. I can safely tuck away my DVD copy in storage now, because Paramount has put together a fittingly wonderful Blu-Ray release for one of the true cinematic gems from the last decade, giving it a gorgeous five-star transfer and culling together both the features from the original DVD release as well as adding excellent, brand new features. They even threw in the theatrical trailer in HD (something which was missing from the DVD) and is always a welcome addition to any video release. Quite simply, I offer my highest recommendation for ""Road to Perdition"" on Blu-Ray.

597907,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B00005JLBQ,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[2, 4]","...In the 30's in the Midwest, crime is controlled in cities large and small by the mob.  In each city, the ethnic group in charge of criminal activities depends on the surroundings.  In the mythical midwestern city where the film starts out, the Irish Rooney family is in charge.  The film opens as Rooney patriarch, John, (Paul Newman) is hosting a wake for one of his ""fellows"".  The young Sullivan family (Hanks, Jennifer Jason-Leigh and two sons) is in attendance, and it becomes quickly evident that Rooney treats Michael Sr. (Hanks) as a son (he participated in Mike's coming of age, has employed Mike, and Mike seemingly is his most successful bagman and enforcer), and Michael and Peter (Tyler Hoechlin & Liam Aiken) as grandsons.  The men of the film, with the exception of Rooney's disreputable son Connor (Daniel Craig) are taciturn and solemn - all business, cold and bleak.  Hard men, for hard times.Mike Jr., at 12, is convinced his father is more than just an ordinary man, but can already feel the strangeness of suspecting that what his dad does for a living doesn't fit with the religious and moral code so evident in the Sullivan household.  He hides in the car one night as his father and Connor set out for a ""discussion"" with a disenchanted member of Rooney's organization.  The film erupts with the violence that Mike Jr. witnesses.  Soon, both Sullivan's are on the run from the Rooney organization, which has closed ranks to protect Connor, seemingly because they cannot trust Mike Jr. to keep what he saw a secret.  Mrs. Sullivan and Peter are assassinated by Connor and the two remaining must find a way to stay safe and to gain their revenge.  The tragic tale that follows is less about the storyline and more about the parallels of father/son relationships.Mendes earned, with his reputation, the right to work with some of the best in the business.  Hanks always rises to perform as a master when surrounded by a talented ensemble, and particularly with an actor/actress of Newman's caliber.  Hanks is self-contained, communicating with his eyes and his instinctive reactions to events.  His scene at the piano with Newman, and his victory in the rain against Newman's men are both masterful displays of acting prowess.  He's not alone in these scenes, and Newman is memorable here - easily slipping from engaging man among men to fearsome patriarch to a father torn by anguish over competing responsibilities to family - should he value his own flesh and blood more than the ""son"" who is his by demeanor, ability and character?Young Hoechlin, as Mike, Jr., is either one of the finest young actors we have seen, or, more likely, a truly successful student of Mendes/Hanks - he conveys much of what we learn about him with his eyes and his gestures.  Jude Law has a scary turn, as a smarmy contract killer, and too little is seen of Stanley Tucci as a Chicago mobster, and of Jason Leigh.  Both, however, get more screen time than Anthony LaPaglia, who was cast as Al Capone, but all of the film of his character ended up on the cutting room floor.Strong performances make memorable characters, but the plotline of ""Perdition"" is thin.  Mendes enhances the film with its own bleakness.  The sound and the lighting capture the suspense - both are almost visceral in the violent sequences, and the cinematography of Conrad Hall is evident in the transition of camera shots - the film manages to feel like a series of artistic masterpieces wound together as a film.  Each time two characters meet in a one on one sequence (be it Connor warning young Michael, a kindly farmwoman who confronts Mike Sr. with the knowledge of how much he means to his son, or the dawning awareness of the danger in a roadside diner where Law's Maguire  and Sullivan meet) the film draws you in to the sequence as though it were really unfolding before you.There will be many filmgoers who are amazed by ""The Road to Perdition"", and many who will reject it because it was billed as a successor to ""The Godfather"", and, aside from the mob plot and the tales of family revenge and relationships, the two have very little in common.  ""Perdition"" takes place over 6 short weeks - ""The Godfather"" unfolds over two decades.  The sense of golden unreality that captured viewers for Puzo's rich storyline is missing from the quick sketch of the harsh midwestern mob life in the 30's.Hardest for me as a filmgoer is the film's ending.  A little short on plot, it leaves us with an implausible, if necessary conclusion.  We've guessed it all along based on the way Mendes introduces the film, but the closing sequence, (again, beautifully filmed) is melodramatic and unrealistic.  Mike Jr. would have taken the action he had to take to survive.For adult moviegoers this summer, it is a quietly powerful film choice, beautifully made.",4,"Too much hype for ""Perdition""...",1027296000,"07 22, 2002",2002,4830,"['30', 'Midwest', 'crime', 'controlled', 'cities', 'large', 'small', 'mob', 'city', 'ethnic', 'group', 'charge', 'criminal', 'activities', 'surroundings', 'mythical', 'midwestern', 'city', 'where', 'film', 'out', 'Irish', 'Rooney', 'family', 'charge', 'film', 'Rooney', 'patriarch', 'John', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'hosting', 'wake', 'one', 'fellows', 'young', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'Hanks', 'Jennifer', 'Jason-Leigh', 'two', 'sons', 'attendance', 'quickly', 'evident', 'Rooney', 'Michael', 'Sr.', 'Hanks', 'son', 'participated', 'Mike', 'coming', 'age', 'employed', 'Mike', 'Mike', 'seemingly', 'most', 'successful', 'bagman', 'enforcer', 'Michael', 'Peter', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'Liam', 'Aiken', 'grandsons', 'men', 'film', 'exception', 'Rooney', 'disreputable', 'son', 'Connor', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'are', 'taciturn', 'solemn', 'business', 'cold', 'bleak', 'Hard', 'men', 'hard', 'times.Mike', 'Jr.', '12', 'convinced', 'father', 'more', 'just', 'ordinary', 'man', 'can', 'already', 'feel', 'strangeness', 'suspecting', 'what', 'dad', 'living', ""n't"", 'fit', 'religious', 'moral', 'code', 'so', 'evident', 'Sullivan', 'household', 'car', 'one', 'night', 'father', 'Connor', 'set', 'out', 'discussion', 'disenchanted', 'member', 'Rooney', 'organization', 'film', 'erupts', 'violence', 'Mike', 'Jr.', 'Soon', 'Sullivan', 'are', 'run', 'Rooney', 'organization', 'closed', 'ranks', 'protect', 'Connor', 'seemingly', 'can', 'not', 'trust', 'Mike', 'Jr.', 'keep', 'what', 'saw', 'secret', 'Mrs.', 'Sullivan', 'Peter', 'are', 'assassinated', 'Connor', 'two', 'remaining', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'stay', 'safe', 'gain', 'revenge', 'tragic', 'tale', 'less', 'storyline', 'more', 'parallels', 'father/son', 'relationships.Mendes', 'earned', 'reputation', 'right', 'work', 'best', 'business', 'Hanks', 'always', 'perform', 'master', 'when', 'surrounded', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'particularly', 'actor/actress', 'Newman', 'caliber', 'Hanks', 'self-contained', 'communicating', 'eyes', 'instinctive', 'reactions', 'events', 'scene', 'piano', 'Newman', 'victory', 'rain', 'Newman', 'men', 'are', 'masterful', 'displays', 'acting', 'prowess', 'not', 'alone', 'scenes', 'Newman', 'memorable', 'here', 'easily', 'slipping', 'engaging', 'man', 'men', 'fearsome', 'patriarch', 'father', 'torn', 'anguish', 'competing', 'responsibilities', 'family', 'should', 'value', 'own', 'flesh', 'blood', 'more', 'son', 'who', 'demeanor', 'ability', 'character', 'Young', 'Hoechlin', 'Mike', 'Jr.', 'one', 'finest', 'young', 'actors', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'likely', 'truly', 'successful', 'student', 'Mendes/Hanks', 'much', 'what', 'learn', 'eyes', 'gestures', 'Jude', 'Law', 'scary', 'turn', 'smarmy', 'contract', 'killer', 'too', 'little', 'seen', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Chicago', 'mobster', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Both', 'however', 'get', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'who', 'was', 'cast', 'Al', 'Capone', 'film', 'character', 'ended', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor.Strong', 'performances', 'make', 'memorable', 'characters', 'plotline', 'Perdition', 'thin', 'Mendes', 'film', 'own', 'bleakness', 'sound', 'lighting', 'capture', 'suspense', 'are', 'almost', 'visceral', 'violent', 'sequences', 'cinematography', 'Conrad', 'Hall', 'evident', 'transition', 'camera', 'shots', 'film', 'feel', 'series', 'artistic', 'masterpieces', 'wound', 'together', 'film', 'time', 'two', 'characters', 'meet', 'one', 'one', 'sequence', 'be', 'Connor', 'warning', 'young', 'Michael', 'kindly', 'farmwoman', 'who', 'Mike', 'Sr.', 'knowledge', 'how', 'much', 'son', 'dawning', 'awareness', 'danger', 'roadside', 'diner', 'where', 'Law', 'Maguire', 'Sullivan', 'meet', 'film', 'draws', 'sequence', 'were', 'really', 'unfolding', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'filmgoers', 'who', 'are', 'amazed', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'many', 'who', 'will', 'reject', 'was', 'billed', 'successor', 'Godfather', 'aside', 'mob', 'plot', 'tales', 'family', 'revenge', 'relationships', 'two', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'Perdition', 'place', '6', 'short', 'weeks', 'Godfather', 'two', 'decades', 'sense', 'golden', 'unreality', 'captured', 'viewers', 'Puzo', 'rich', 'storyline', 'missing', 'quick', 'sketch', 'harsh', 'midwestern', 'mob', 'life', ""30's.Hardest"", 'filmgoer', 'film', 'ending', 'little', 'short', 'plot', 'implausible', 'necessary', 'conclusion', ""'ve"", 'guessed', 'along', 'based', 'way', 'Mendes', 'film', 'closing', 'sequence', 'again', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'melodramatic', 'unrealistic', 'Mike', 'Jr.', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'action', 'had', 'take', 'survive.For', 'adult', 'moviegoers', 'summer', 'quietly', 'powerful', 'film', 'choice', 'beautifully', 'made']",N/A
597908,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00005JLBQ,magellan,"[1, 1]","I thought this movie was surprisingly good given that it's based on a graphic novel, so I didn't expect it to have the depth and subtlety of something based on a novel. But it's a fine movie nevertheless. And a movie starring both Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, as well as Jude Law, is certainly one to make one sit up and take notice from the standpoint of the cast.The movie chronicles the fall from grace of Mike Sullivan, a hit man working for a local mob boss, played by Paul Newman. Sullivan's life up till then has been a priviledged one, especially for the Depression era--his family lives in the biggest house on the block, and he is relatively prosperous. He is said to be respected by his cronies and a couple of times people in the movie compliment him on his doing ""good work."" But despite his esteemed position in the mob, Sullivan's life starts to unravel as a result of one unfortunate event, caused by his boy, which wasn't his fault. Now Sullivan is the hunted victim, who eventually returns to wreak his vengeance. At that point the danger lurking beneath the otherwise highly polished surface of his comfortable life becomes evident. The movie is really another variation on the theme of those who live sword eventually die by the sword.The DVD discusses the making of the film and includes a lot of extra footage with many deleted scenes, probably 8 or 10, more than I've seen on most DVDs. Some fans of the movie might be interested in all this missing material. I watched most of them just to see what was edited out. Also there are comments on the making of the movie that I found interesting.For example, the costume designer had an especially hard time duplicating the clothing of the period, which was the early 30s. He said that they had trouble finding good examples from the period, and that the style of the time was sort of plain compared to what came before during the Roaring Twenties and after. They also couldn't find the right sort of heavy cloth used at the time. They finally found a manufacturer who was able to do a special order for them so it was basically custom made for the movie.The movie was shot on location in Chicago, using some historic locations, and in the Illinois countryside. I was born in Chicago so I had a little interest in that. Most of the movie is shot in winter, and one time they were actually shooting in 30 below zero and everyone was freezing.

Sullivan (Tom Hanks), the adoptive son of John Rooney (Paul Newman), is a cold-blooded killer working for his crime boss ""father"" in the winter of 1931, when his own twelve-year-old son, Mike Jr., inadvertently witnesses a ""hit"" in which his father participates.Subsequently, the Sullivans, father and son, take off for Chicago to meet with Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci), underworld lieutenant to Al Capone.  Mike Sullivan, Sr. is also hoping to get to Perdition, an appropriately named Midwestern town, so he can leave is son with his sister-in-law.  Sadistic hitman Harlan Maguire (Jude Law), who enjoys photographing the death throes of his victims, is soon on the Sullivans' trail to through the midwest.Conrad L. Hall, to whom the film is dedicated, uses photography to its fullest advantage winning a posthumous Academy Award for his cinematography.  Shot in winter, the film preserves the flavor of early black and white films, with sharp contrasts, and the use of dark, somber colors, when colors are used at all.  Snow, ice, rain, and fog perpetuate the cold darkness of the scenes, and Hall's use of architectural framing is stunning, particularly his repeated use of windows.  He keeps the scenes simple, often focusing on individual characters in contexts which reveal their emotional states.  In one memorable scene, for example, light from a streetlight outside a window casts the shadow of rain on an interior wall, suggesting both tears and cleansing.Newman is terrific as an aging mob boss, playing his part with just the right mix of frailty and cruelty (for which he was nominated for an Academy Award).  Tyler Hoechlin, as 12-year-old Mike, Jr., reveals his fears and vulnerabilities at the same time that he shows his satisfaction as the center of his father's attention (winning Best Young Actor from the Broadcast Film Critics Association).  Jude Law, made up to look like a true, wild-eyed psychopath, is terrifying.  Hanks looks menacing and acts viciously until his concern for his son overtakes all other emotions in a moving, climactic scene, though it is difficult to accept him in the role of a hitman.Period music adds style to the film, and original music by Thomas Newman (and the title song by John Williams), mostly piano and strings, preserves the period tone.  Filled with the horror of violence and considerable suspense, this noir film gives a human face to mob violence in the thirties.  Mary Whipple",4,"""There is only one guarantee.

It is an unrelentingly dark and somber tale; `perdition', after all, is another word for hell.The year is 1931, the place is a small town not far from Chicago. Prohibition has spawned a nation of thugs and gangsters. Legitimate businesses have become hubs of criminal activity. The town is run by a ruthless Irish family headed by John Rooney [Paul Newman] His real son, Connor [Daniel Craig], is his cynical, hot-headed heir, and his adopted son, Michael Sullivan [Tom Hanks], is his enforcer. A great rivalry exists between the two sons. One rainy night, one of the Michael's boys, twelve year old Michael Jr. [Tyler Hoechlin], hides in his father's car and goes along on a job. What he witnesses forever changes his life, puts the rest of his family in mortal danger, and gives John the perfect opportunity to rid himself of his rival. It also gives Michael Sullivan his only chance to see that his son does not become like him.The movie is beautifully rendered in dark tones, giving it the look of a nightmarish dream. This is appropriate because the story is told from the boy's point of view and is a memory from his childhood.""Road to Perdition"" is not intended to be realistic. It, like the graphic novel it is based on, is a fantasy. It plays like an updated Greek / Shakespearean tragedy, and its mood is almost operatic. From a commercial point of view, it might have benefited from a bit more levity, but I admire Mendes, a true artist, for keeping his vision consistent and true. It is a movie which will be remembered long after most of 2002's releases are forgotten.",5,"Dark, somber, meticulously crafted.

597919,A3K8TYU7UOUTR0,B00005JLBQ,M. Dog,"[1, 1]","This is one of the best movies of 2002. Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is an enforcer in a 1930's Irish mob, led by kingpin, John Rooney (Paul Newman). Things are somber yet smooth until Sullivan's son witnesses a hit. The status quo is destroyed. No one is really comfortable with Sullivan's son being alive to tell the tale, yet Sullivan is like a son to his boss, John Rooney. Thus the conflict and the engine that drives the movie forward.This is really a beautifully done movie in about every respect. The first striking thing is Tom Hanks cast as an Irish hit man. There is something about Tom Hanks that is mesmerizing on the screen, something extremely watchable. After enjoying him in different roles, like in Saving Private Ryan and Castaway and particularly this role, the best way to describe this quality is there is a depth of thought present in Hanks at all times, combined with a complete natural quality in front of the camera. It is a great piece of casting, setting Hanks against type as a man of violence, and it works in spades. Paul Newman has the role of a lifetime as John Rooney, ""son of the old sod"" and gang leader. Newman brought just the right blend of authority, power, and Irish melancholy to the role. The relationship between Sullivan and Rooney seems so believable, so understated and sincere, it is one of the most moving things about the movie.This film is about fathers and sons, and there are three father/son relationships at stake here: Sullivan and his son, Rooney and his son (played with crazed zeal by Daniel Craig), and finally the relationship between the boss and his prime enforcer. In character parts, Stanley Tucci brings his usual dignity to the mix as  Frank Nitti, and Jude Law is creepy and nearly unrecognizable as Maguire, the contract killer sent to deal with Sullivan and son.The other striking thing for me was the interesting and unique way the film dealt with violence. Nearly all the violence was off screen or just out of shot. The blood squirting plasma-sacs were at a minimum in this movie, and the scenes were so much more powerful for it. It particular, the Tommy Gun scene, where Hanks uses this weapon from the shadows (those that have seen the film will know which scene I mean) was shot with no sound except the musical soundtrack. Hank's gun just produces a strobe of silent flashes from the darkness. I believe this scene just as innovative as any of Sam Peckinpaw's ""ballet of death"" scenes from the late 60's and 70's. A great film with a gripping, well-rounded story.

597923,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B00005JLBQ,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[39, 47]","Sam Mendes' ""The Road to Perdition"" is a film about family: extended, brother against brother, father and sons and ultimately father against sons. It's about the world of Men in much the same tradition as ""East of Eden,"" which it thematically  resembles. Mendes tackles big ideas here:  the sanctity of the family, a father's love of family, a father's right to protect his family and a natural versus an adopted son's place in a family (the right of succession). But Mendes uses the small details of life to develop these themes so that his lofty ideas have a pervasive as well as persuasive effect on the viewer.Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a family man (2 sons, Michael Jr. and Peter) who works for John Rooney (Paul Newman) as a bodyguard and hit man. John has a son, Connor (David Craig)who is intensely jealous of his father's relationship with Michael. It is obvious that John prefers Michael: strong, obedient, intelligent, over his natural son, Connor: weak, smarmy, conniving, underhanded, hotheaded.One evening, Michael Jr., eager and curious to find out what exactly his father does for a living, hides in his father's car while Michael Sr. goes out on a ""business call"" with Connor to strong arm an associate that ends with Connor recklessly killing the associate with Michael Jr. witnessing the entire event.This proves to be the turning point in the film and the event that sets the remainder of the film in motion: can Michael Jr. be trusted to keep his mouth shut? Connor has some definite ideas about this.One of the most impressive set pieces of the film is a showdown between Michael and John Rooney and his henchman on a public street at night in the pouring rain, shot with absolutely no sound nor blood in sight.  It is as effective in it's way as the last, very bloody scene in ""Bonnie and Clyde.""Conrad Hall has shot the film in a dark, grayish, almost colorless palette very similar to""The Yards,"" also coincidentally a film about a family involved in crime. The criminal life for Hall and Mendes then is not the chiaroscuro life that Coppola envisions it in his Godfather trilogy, but one of black and gray signifying a life of hiding, back alleys and drudgery devoid of color, enjoyment and living.  The music is also extremely effective and evocative especially since Mendes has shot large portions of the film without dialogue.The acting is top drawer with Tyler Hoechlin as Michael Jr. almost stealing the picture away from the always effective Tom Hanks, Jude Law and Paul Newman.Sam Mendes has fashioned a film of the utmost purity and beauty: a tone poem to the family and to the father-son relationship in particular.""The Road to Perdition"" is a film that resonates with regret and sadness but more importantly an over-riding feeling that, as gangsters ""getting into heaven""as John Rooney states... is not a possibility.",5,Only Michael Jr. has a chance to get into Heaven,1026691200,"07 15, 2002",2002,2858,"['Sam', 'Mendes', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'film', 'family', 'extended', 'brother', 'brother', 'father', 'sons', 'ultimately', 'father', 'sons', 'world', 'Men', 'much', 'same', 'tradition', 'East', 'Eden', 'thematically', 'Mendes', 'big', 'ideas', 'here', 'sanctity', 'family', 'father', 'love', 'family', 'father', 'right', 'protect', 'family', 'natural', 'versus', 'adopted', 'son', 'place', 'family', 'right', 'succession', 'Mendes', 'small', 'details', 'life', 'develop', 'themes', 'so', 'lofty', 'ideas', 'have', 'pervasive', 'as', 'well', 'persuasive', 'effect', 'viewer.Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'family', 'man', '2', 'sons', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'Peter', 'who', 'John', 'Rooney', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'bodyguard', 'hit', 'man', 'John', 'son', 'Connor', 'David', 'Craig', 'who', 'intensely', 'jealous', 'father', 'relationship', 'Michael', 'obvious', 'John', 'prefers', 'Michael', 'strong', 'obedient', 'intelligent', 'natural', 'son', 'Connor', 'weak', 'smarmy', 'conniving', 'underhanded', 'hotheaded.One', 'evening', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'eager', 'curious', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'exactly', 'father', 'living', 'hides', 'father', 'car', 'Michael', 'Sr.', 'out', 'business', 'call', 'Connor', 'strong', 'arm', 'associate', 'Connor', 'recklessly', 'killing', 'associate', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'witnessing', 'entire', 'event.This', 'be', 'turning', 'point', 'film', 'event', 'remainder', 'film', 'motion', 'can', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'be', 'trusted', 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'Connor', 'definite', 'ideas', 'this.One', 'most', 'impressive', 'set', 'pieces', 'film', 'showdown', 'Michael', 'John', 'Rooney', 'henchman', 'public', 'street', 'night', 'pouring', 'rain', 'shot', 'absolutely', 'sound', 'blood', 'sight', 'effective', 'way', 'last', 'very', 'bloody', 'scene', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Conrad', 'Hall', 'shot', 'film', 'dark', 'grayish', 'almost', 'colorless', 'palette', 'very', 'similar', 'Yards', 'also', 'coincidentally', 'film', 'family', 'involved', 'crime', 'criminal', 'life', 'Hall', 'Mendes', 'then', 'not', 'chiaroscuro', 'life', 'Coppola', 'Godfather', 'trilogy', 'one', 'black', 'gray', 'signifying', 'life', 'hiding', 'back', 'alleys', 'drudgery', 'devoid', 'color', 'enjoyment', 'living', 'music', 'also', 'extremely', 'effective', 'evocative', 'especially', 'Mendes', 'shot', 'large', 'portions', 'film', 'dialogue.The', 'acting', 'top', 'drawer', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'almost', 'stealing', 'picture', 'away', 'always', 'effective', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Paul', 'Newman.Sam', 'Mendes', 'fashioned', 'film', 'utmost', 'purity', 'beauty', 'tone', 'poem', 'family', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'particular', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'film', 'regret', 'sadness', 'more', 'importantly', 'over-riding', 'feeling', 'gangsters', 'getting', 'heaven', 'John', 'Rooney', 'states', 'not', 'possibility']",N/A

Its most powerful scene is when Tom Hanks as the hitman Michael Sullivan takes out Paul Newman's hitmen on a raindrenched street; there is no dialogue, no accompanying soundtrack, just slowmotion of the shootings and the knowledge Newman has of what lies in store. It's ultimately chilling and fascinating in its execution.Tyler Hoechlin shines as Michael's young son who witnesses his father at work in the execution of a member of Newman's brood.  Ciaran Hinds (so good in &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot; and &quot;Sum of all Fears&quot;) is the victim; the killer is Newman's spoiled son, played well by Daniel Craig.  When Craig has Hanks' wife and youngest son murdered, this tale of vengeance spins into its ultimately tragic denouement.Jude Law is frighteningly chilling in his portrayal of a photographer who loves to photograph the dead, and is hired to take out Hanks.  Stanley Tucci is superb as Frank Nitti, Al Capone's henchman.Tom Hanks is excellent, too, as a father who hasn't taken the time to know his son, and whose life of killing catches up with him.

And there is only one guarantee... none of us will see heaven.""One of the most powerful and devastating quotes comes from Paul Newman's character, John Rooney, in this amazing and breathtaking crime/drama, ""Road to Perdition,"" which I think could easily be the ""Godfather"" of 2000.  And it's about time.Tom Hanks is a loving father with a beautiful wife and two children.  Peter, the youngest, and Michael, the oldest.  But that's not all to Hanks' character.  He is also a hit man for mob boss, John Rooney.  Hanks' line of work is never discussed with his family.  Ever.One night, everything goes wrong.  On what was supposed to be a simple job, Hanks and Rooney's son end up having to kill a loudmouth who insulted Rooney at a wake and his goons.  What they didn't realize was that the son, Michael, had hid inside the car and was able to see everything.  He is completley devastated and has no idea how to act.  Hanks knows that he has a problem.  No matter how much he believes that his son will not talk, other parties aren't so sure.  The results end up with Hank's wife and younger son being murdered.  Now, they know there's no turning back and they must flee the area.  Hanks very much wants to put a bullet in the man responsible for his wife and younger son's deaths, but his main concern is Michael's safety.  And he will do anything it takes to make sure that not a single hair on his head is harmed.  And that he never has to lead the life that he has.This was such a fantastic movie.  The direction and acting was outstanding.  The cinematography was also very impressive, indeed.  The movie gives you a sense of dread, sorrow, pain, and yet, hope.  I also enjoyed the score to the movie very much.Tom Hanks breaks away from his tradtional ""nice guy"" roll and is able to show us his darker side.  That might anger some die-hard Hanks fans, but a true actor should be able to break away from traditional roles.  He does a great job in bringing depth and heart to his character, as well as bringing a sort of darkness and burden.Paul Newman also outdoes himself with giving one hell of a performance.  Jude Law also should be recognized as well.The only downside to this movie is that it is a downer.  You will not want to see this if you do not want to feel sadness or depressed.  I think they shouldn't had released this movie in the summer, since mostly everybody looks to see comedies and uplifting movies.  Still, it is such a sight to see.  It is a magnificent picture, overall.  Just be warned; you will feel sadness and dread as you watch the movie.  But do not let that stop you from seeing it.I am glad I finally got to see this.  I really did enjoy it, and look forward to seeing it again soon.  This movie really does deserve a few Acadamy Awards.

Smith,"[4, 5]","I've read a lot of screenplays and I'm rather a student of the novel-to-film adaptation process, so I know quite well there have to be differences. They're different media: A book is not a movie. Having recently read the graphic novel on which this excellent flick is based, I have to say it succeeds very well in its own right -- but there are still some things about the original I wish hadn't been changed. This is a *very* different sort of role for Tom Hanks, but he nails the revenge-driven character of Michael Sullivan very nicely. Tyler Hoechlin carries off the son pretty well, too -- but I'm very annoyed that the film-makers thought it necessary to make him unable to kill. That was a very strong, very pointed element of the boy's development in the book. Paul Newman plays the character of John Rooney/Looney differently from the novel, but he actually gives the character of the old tyrant more depth. And the photographer, played beautifully by Jude Law, was an excellent addition. Connor, however, is portrayed as a much weaker and much more ordinary person than in the book, not as the arrogant jerk Collins had in mind. Some good scenes, like the driving lesson, and Sullivan's words to the first bank manager, were indeed taken almost without change from the original story. So, while I would have done some things differently, I have to say this is a terrific piece of work, a small masterpiece.

597929,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JLBQ,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[1, 1]","Road to Perdition, based on the 1998 graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, is the first film for director Sam Mendes since his Academy Award winning film, American Beauty. The film is also a first for one of its stars, Tom Hanks. As promoted by Dreamworks Pictures, this is the first time where you see Tom Hanks as a villain in a feature film. Tom Hanks alone should be a big draw for many moviegoers but who can argue with world of marketing. The film also features some other big stars outside of Tom Hanks. They would include Paul Newman, who worked The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and Jude Law, whose works include A.I. and Enemy at the Gates. But will these big stars be a big enough draw to have moviegoers sit through a depressing gangster film?The story that Michael Sullivan is caring and loving husband and father. Set in early 1930's in the city of Chicago, Sullivan works for Mr. John Rooney. Michael never had a father, so Rooney raised him as his own and taught him the ropes of the business he was involved with. Now all grown up and having a family of his own, Sullivan's life changes in many dramatic ways. His oldest son, curious of what his father does for a living, sneaks into the back of his car the night of one of his jobs. The young boy witnesses the accidental murder a man and discoveries that he father is part of the mob. Sullivan assures Rooney that the boy will remain silent but the mob is not so sure. To secure silence they murder Sullivan's wife and other son. This sends Michael Sullivan on an unpredictable journey to the town of Perdition as he tries to save the life of his son and seek revenge on the people he once called family. Road to Perdition's story is very well done though long. The film has plenty of gunfight sequences but for long stretches there are moments that just seem long and boring with continuous talking. Not to say the dialogues is bad, not at all, but to say that there seems to be too much in certain areas.The acting is top notch in Road to Perdition with the all-star cast advertised very prominently. Tom Hanks performs exceptionally well, as usual. I do not agree that his character is actually a villain in the film. How is he a villain when he tries to save the life of his son? Just because he is a gangster makes him a villain? One can make an argument for either side but it can be said there is a middle ground for his character. Paul Newman gives one of his best performances as the head of a mobster family. His lines are probably the most memorable in the entire film not because of where they are featured but for the emotion he uses to say those lines. Jude Law is well placed as the ""Reporter"", though I believe his character wasn't as necessary as most of the other characters in the film. Other supporting characters were well done but not hugely outstanding in the film.Road to Perdition is a good film but not a great film. It is a film that is just a normally good popcorn flick and nothing beyond that. The dialogue was good and the story was interesting but there are some conflicts with what happens in the film. Most of the characters in the film are gangsters and know they are involved in a life of murder and greed but when bad things happen, they seem all shocked that it is happening to them. You weren't expecting that? Also, some of the characters, including the boy who plays the son of Michael Sullivan, seem pretty dull and don't really do anything to show a hugely exceptional performance. Another problem was the relationship between Sullivan and his son. You don't really get to see much closeness between the two and yet in the end, they both seem to be on good terms. There were some signs but not a huge lot. Outside of those small scrabbles, the film is very well presented especially with the beautiful sets and the great use of cinematography. Road to Perdition should at least be checked out on DVD or VHS once for its artistic merit.",4,The Moose Hole - Entertaining 'Road',1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,3961,"['Road', 'Perdition', 'based', '1998', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Max', 'Allan', 'Collins', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'film', 'American', 'Beauty', 'film', 'also', 'first', 'one', 'stars', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'promoted', 'Dreamworks', 'Pictures', 'first', 'time', 'where', 'see', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'villain', 'feature', 'film', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'alone', 'should', 'be', 'big', 'draw', 'many', 'moviegoers', 'who', 'can', 'argue', 'world', 'marketing', 'film', 'also', 'other', 'big', 'stars', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'would', 'include', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'who', 'worked', 'Sting', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'Jude', 'Law', 'works', 'include', 'A.I', 'Enemy', 'Gates', 'will', 'big', 'stars', 'be', 'big', 'enough', 'draw', 'have', 'moviegoers', 'sit', 'depressing', 'gangster', 'film', 'story', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'caring', 'loving', 'husband', 'father', 'Set', 'early', '1930', 'city', 'Chicago', 'Sullivan', 'Mr.', 'John', 'Rooney', 'Michael', 'never', 'had', 'father', 'Rooney', 'raised', 'own', 'taught', 'ropes', 'business', 'was', 'involved', 'Now', 'grown', 'up', 'having', 'family', 'own', 'Sullivan', 'life', 'changes', 'many', 'dramatic', 'ways', 'oldest', 'son', 'curious', 'what', 'father', 'living', 'back', 'car', 'night', 'one', 'jobs', 'young', 'boy', 'accidental', 'murder', 'man', 'discoveries', 'part', 'mob', 'Sullivan', 'Rooney', 'boy', 'will', 'remain', 'silent', 'mob', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'secure', 'silence', 'murder', 'Sullivan', 'wife', 'other', 'son', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'unpredictable', 'journey', 'town', 'Perdition', 'save', 'life', 'son', 'seek', 'revenge', 'people', 'once', 'called', 'family', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'long', 'film', 'plenty', 'gunfight', 'sequences', 'long', 'stretches', 'are', 'moments', 'just', 'seem', 'long', 'boring', 'continuous', 'talking', 'Not', 'say', 'dialogues', 'bad', 'not', 'say', 'there', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'certain', 'areas.The', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'all-star', 'cast', 'advertised', 'very', 'prominently', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'performs', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'usual', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'character', 'actually', 'villain', 'film', 'How', 'villain', 'when', 'save', 'life', 'son', 'Just', 'gangster', 'villain', 'One', 'can', 'make', 'argument', 'side', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'middle', 'ground', 'character', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'head', 'mobster', 'family', 'lines', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'memorable', 'entire', 'film', 'not', 'where', 'are', 'featured', 'emotion', 'say', 'lines', 'Jude', 'Law', 'well', 'placed', 'Reporter', 'believe', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'necessary', 'most', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'Other', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'hugely', 'outstanding', 'film.Road', 'Perdition', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'film', 'just', 'normally', 'good', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'nothing', 'dialogue', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'are', 'conflicts', 'what', 'film', 'Most', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'gangsters', 'know', 'are', 'involved', 'life', 'murder', 'greed', 'when', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'seem', 'shocked', 'happening', 'were', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Also', 'characters', 'including', 'boy', 'who', 'son', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'seem', 'pretty', 'dull', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'show', 'hugely', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'problem', 'was', 'relationship', 'Sullivan', 'son', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'see', 'much', 'closeness', 'two', 'yet', 'end', 'seem', 'be', 'good', 'terms', 'were', 'signs', 'not', 'huge', 'lot', 'small', 'scrabbles', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'especially', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'great', 'use', 'cinematography', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'checked', 'out', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'once', 'artistic', 'merit']",N/A

597931,A1VLHZ9KXRGVE0,B00005JLBQ,Mike,"[0, 1]","When I had first heard of this film, I knew that I just had to see it. The premise of the movie grabbed me, and I made plans to go on opening weekend. I did go, and I was incredibly moved by the experience.Tom Hanks is Michael Sullivan, a happily married father of two sons and works for a Mr. Rooney (Paul Newman). His oldest son, Michael, becomes curious as to what his father does for a living, because he really doesn't know, no matter how much he thinks he does. One night, Mr. Rooney's son, Connor (Daniel Craig), is told to go and ""talk"" to one of Mr. Rooney's friends who began to mouth off at his brother's wake. He is informed that Michael Sullivan (Hanks) is to go with him. The young Michael sees this as an opportunity to honestly find out what, in fact, his dad does for a career, and hides in the back of the car. In the midst of the whole situation, Connor loses his temper and shoots the man whom they were sent to talk to, with the assistance of the young Michael's father. The young Michael witnesses the whole thing, and suddenly, no one is safe. The father and son must escape their danger, and leave immediately, while also finding out a way to bring justice to the mob.The movie is definitely worth the price of admission, although I'm not so sure that it should be compared side by side to classics such as the Godfather series. I loved the movie, but it is hard to tell whether or not it should be remembered at the Oscar race. It was great, but it was just a little too full of itself to be considered as good as The Godfather. However, it was great, it did move me, and the photography was intensely beautiful in itself. Jude Law was absolutely incredible as McGuire, who was hired to kill Sullivan, and his performance deserves to stand out as a nominee for ""Best Supporting Actor.""

597932,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00005JLBQ,Mike Stone,"[12, 16]","For those of you confused by the title, this is not Hope and Crosby's version of the Faustian myth.  It's Sam Mendes follow-up to ""American Beauty"".  It's Tom Hanks most internalized acting performance.  It's Paul Newman making a rare, and much needed, return to the big screen.  It's Jude Law with bad teeth and a balding patch, Jennifer Jason Leigh with almost no lines, and Conrad Hall with another virtuoso example of how to light a movie.  It's all these things and more.  But somehow, it also manages to be all these things and less.  But more on that later.Like in his previous film, Sam Mendes gives away the fate of his main character within the first couple lines of dialogue.  The wheel has been set a-spinning, and the only question is how it all plays out.  Mendes is a director less interested in the final destination than in the road taken to get there (""Road to Beauty"" might have been a better title for his first film; then again, ""American Perdition"" would be quite apt here).  Although, to be fair, the final outcome appears more in doubt here than in that last effort, even with all the gangster talk about ""the life we chose"" and ""none of us will see heaven.""Visually, Mendes knows how to frame a scene.  Mostly, we see things from the point of view of Michael Sullivan, Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), the eldest son of Mike Sullivan, Sr. (Tom Hanks), lead enforcer for town boss John Rooney (Paul Newman).  Mike Jr. stows away in his father's car one night, in the hopes of finding out how the old man pays the bills.  Through a hole in the wall, at feet level so all he can see of his dad are his shoes, he witnesses the brutal, tommy gun murder of a bootlegger.  This is the moment that sets the film down its road.  Mendes handles it perfectly, allowing the audience to experience the scene as Young Mike does: the visceral destruction and the sorrow of it all, the sonic boom of guns going off in unison, twinkling as bullet shells hit the floor.  Watch how this scene, with its over-the-top cacophony of sounds, is contrasted by a later shooting.  Scored only by the powerful rhythm of the ocean, which sounds like the breathing of a giant, and bathed in white light, whereas the earlier scene was set on a rainy night, the emotional resonance of this scene is heartbreaking.  It's a skillful cinematic moment, made more impressive when one realizes it was filmed by a man making only his second movie.Hanks is quiet and reserved as the cold-blooded mob killer.  It's not a very glamorous role, though.  Sure, he shows prodigious talent at his job.  And he gets to stomp around armed with a cool noir get-up: fedora, overcoat, tommy gun.  But he looks worn down, dirty, unshaven, and, quite frankly, pudgy for the majority of the film.  No matter.  Because even when he's not saying anything, Hanks manages to say everything.  His eyes do much of the work here, replacing the charm that he usually uses to get through big parts.  It's not as fine a piece of work as his best performance, ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it's got many of the same characteristics, and is surely in the same ballpark.Newman, relegated to playing supporting character parts these days, proves he still has the chops to rise to the occasion.  Rooney must be a lovable old coot (he is), a distant father (he is), a feared dictator (he is), a man capable of menacing anger (he is; to my surprise, Newman still has the force of will to bang on a table and make the whole room feel it), and one who can just as easily resign himself to his own fate (he does).  The silver in his hair and the wrinkles on his face may age him, but that low, tremulous voice help him deliver another in a long line of vintage Paul Newman performances.  He's still a treasure.Jude Law has a fairly enigmatic part.  Best known for works where he is the definitive male object of desire, here Law sports a thinning hairline, unkempt fingernails, and rotting brown teeth.  I question the choice of casting Law for this role, like I question the choice of casting the gorgeous Cameron Diaz in ""Being John Malkovich"": why not just get an uglier actor?  But, like Diaz, Law acts his way into my good graces (just like he always does).  His photographer/killer moves like an agitated cat.  Even though the character is somewhat two-dimensional, Law manages to bring him to life.Sadly, these three actors, some of my favourites, don't get many chances to shine together.  But when they do, you aren't going to find anything better.  A cast full of fine actors supports them.  Stanley Tucci is reserved and business like as Capone right-hand man Frank Nitti.  Daniel Craig does well showing the envy and pettiness of Connor Rooney, a son tormented by a father who'd prefer he was a different man.  Jennifer Jason Leigh, an actress of stunning power, has absolutely nothing to do here.  If I counted right, she has but three lines.  Shame, that.  And young Tyler Hoechlin doesn't do anything outstanding as Young Mike, but that's probably for the best.  Inexperienced kid actors who try too hard get on my last nerve.

It's incredible that he still can continue transmitting those qualities while assuming the role of an assassin in Road to Perdition.According to the dictionary, perdition is hell, the loss of the soul, the eternal condemnation. But this movie is more about the fight not to lose oneself in that way. More specifically, it is about a father who0s in the road to perdition and wishes his son never has to cross it.A father and a son united by tragedy embark in a violent trip through America in the winter of 1931. Before the trip, both men practically didn't know each other. 12 year old Michael Sullivan Jr., and its brother Peter little know about their father Michael and his work as an assassin for the local Mafia head, John Rooney (Paul Newman). This man, whose power is compared with God's, has served like a paternal figure for the Sullivan family. His son Connor has felt always envy of the relation between his father and Michael; and these feelings bring violence after Michael Jr. witnesses a crime perpetrated by his father and Connor, an event that makes Connor decide to kill Michael's wife and their sons.Fearing for his life and thirsty of revenge, Michael flees with his surviving son. Their 6-week odyssey allows them to develop the intimate relation they never had before, a relationship that makes Michael think that he doesn't want his son to follow his steps.From the beginning, we know this will be a tragic history. Deliberately slow, Road to Perdition constructs the foundations of its outcome, one that's not arranged with Hollywood conventions but one that feels correct and appropriate, given the erroneous lives of the characters.Each element of Road to Perdition reflects a unified vision and meticulous attention in the details, from the wardrobe, props, to the magnificent cinematography and artistic direction which try to relive the Depression era in the United States.As Sullivan, Tom Hanks interprets his closest version of a villain. His humanity, demonstrated in the relation with his son, smoothes the character to such points that sometimes we forget he is a ruthless assassin. Paul Newman is more than magnificent like Rooney, a man able to feel an immense love by Sullivan, but not sufficiently strong as the familiar bonds. Jude Law gives a macabre touch to Maguire, the contracted assassin to kill Sullivan, whose hobby is take photos from his victims and sell them.All the crew, from the producer to the director, Sam Mendes, wants to make clear that this is a history of parents and children, crimes and punishments, errors and amendments. Nevertheless, Road to Perdition is very cold and distant, unable to involve us with the destiny of their characters. All the pieces fit with too much perfection. Each scene is coldly calculated, each phrase, each silence. It's a film that could have involve us more in the emotional plane, but their creators seem to have resigned to do so when they reached half of the road.",4,Road to redemption,1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,3087,"['selection', 'good', 'men', 'roles', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'being', 'able', 'personify', 'men', 'integrity', 'decency', 'impeccable', 'moral', 'incredible', 'still', 'can', 'continue', 'transmitting', 'qualities', 'assuming', 'role', 'assassin', 'Road', 'Perdition.According', 'dictionary', 'perdition', 'hell', 'loss', 'soul', 'eternal', 'condemnation', 'movie', 'more', 'fight', 'not', 'lose', 'way', 'More', 'specifically', 'father', 'who0s', 'road', 'perdition', 'son', 'never', 'cross', 'it.A', 'father', 'son', 'united', 'tragedy', 'embark', 'violent', 'trip', 'America', 'winter', '1931', 'trip', 'men', 'practically', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Jr.', 'brother', 'Peter', 'little', 'know', 'father', 'Michael', 'work', 'assassin', 'local', 'Mafia', 'head', 'John', 'Rooney', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'man', 'power', 'compared', 'God', 'served', 'paternal', 'figure', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'son', 'Connor', 'felt', 'always', 'envy', 'relation', 'father', 'Michael', 'feelings', 'bring', 'violence', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'crime', 'perpetrated', 'father', 'Connor', 'event', 'Connor', 'decide', 'kill', 'Michael', 'wife', 'sons.Fearing', 'life', 'thirsty', 'revenge', 'Michael', 'surviving', 'son', '6-week', 'odyssey', 'develop', 'intimate', 'relation', 'never', 'had', 'relationship', 'Michael', 'think', ""n't"", 'want', 'son', 'follow', 'steps.From', 'beginning', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'tragic', 'history', 'Deliberately', 'slow', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'foundations', 'outcome', 'one', 'not', 'arranged', 'Hollywood', 'conventions', 'one', 'correct', 'appropriate', 'given', 'erroneous', 'lives', 'characters.Each', 'element', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'unified', 'vision', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'details', 'wardrobe', 'props', 'magnificent', 'cinematography', 'artistic', 'direction', 'try', 'relive', 'Depression', 'era', 'United', 'States.As', 'Sullivan', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'closest', 'version', 'villain', 'humanity', 'demonstrated', 'relation', 'son', 'character', 'such', 'points', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'ruthless', 'assassin', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'more', 'magnificent', 'Rooney', 'man', 'able', 'feel', 'immense', 'love', 'Sullivan', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'strong', 'familiar', 'bonds', 'Jude', 'Law', 'macabre', 'touch', 'Maguire', 'contracted', 'assassin', 'kill', 'Sullivan', 'hobby', 'take', 'photos', 'victims', 'sell', 'them.All', 'crew', 'producer', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'make', 'clear', 'history', 'parents', 'children', 'crimes', 'punishments', 'errors', 'amendments', 'Nevertheless', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'very', 'cold', 'distant', 'unable', 'involve', 'destiny', 'characters', 'pieces', 'fit', 'too', 'much', 'perfection', 'scene', 'coldly', 'calculated', 'phrase', 'silence', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'involve', 'more', 'emotional', 'plane', 'creators', 'seem', 'have', 'resigned', 'do', 'so', 'when', 'reached', 'half', 'road']",N/A

But whether or not you will find any joy in this artistic gangster film depends on what kind of gangland films you are accustomed to.Basically, modern gangster films break down into two groups.  You've got your Scorsese-ites and your Coppola-ites.Your basic Martin Scorsese fan will love movies like ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"", ""Mean Streets.""  They will watch and enjoy films like ""Donnie Brasco,""  ""Heat,"" and ""Training Day.""  Scorsese-ites will watch the Sopranos religiously and enjoy TV series such as ""The Shield"" and ""Kingpin.""  Scorsese-ites love the gritty, hard boiled reality of gang life.  A life, which ultimately has tragic consequences for the film's characters.A Francis Ford Coppola fan will, on the other hand, be a fan of films like ""The Godfather"" and it's sequels.  A Coppola-ite enjoys films like ""Scarface"" and older films of the Noir genre such as ""The Big Sleep,"" ""Public Enemy,"" ""The Maltese Falcon,"" ""Key Largo,"" and other Bogart efforts.  The Coppola fan enjoys the myth of the gangster.  The unrealistic and glamorous depiction of gang life seen in the Godfather trilogy.  These films are `tone poems,' and ""Road to Perdition"" belongs in this category.""Road to Perdition"" is an art film, no doubt about it.  The storytelling is surrealistic and quite removed from reality, as told through a child's eyes.  It's really quite cerebral, and will give gritty, hard-boiled reality fans a disappointing display.

597936,A3RINLIDX74QLP,B00005JLBQ,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""","[4, 5]","Based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, ""Road to Perdition"" is a unique movie in many regards. On the surface it is a gangster film, but the heart of the story has much more to do with the exploration of father/son relationships. Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a hit man for John Rooney (Paul Newman), the mob leader who takes on the role of a surrogate father, and to whom he is indebted. On the other hand, Sullivan is a family man, with a beloved wife and two young sons. But everything changes when the eldest son, also named Michael (Tyler Hoechlin), becomes a witness to a killing in which both his father and Rooney's son Connor (Daniel Craig) take part.Connor, jealous of the favoritism his father shows Sullivan, jumps on the opportunity to get rid of Sullivan and his family, under the guise of eliminating a witness. When Sullivan's wife and younger son are brutally murdered, Sullivan gathers up his remaining son and heads for the town of Perdition, where he intends to deposit Michael with his aunt for safekeeping while he himself hunts down Connor Rooney to exact revenge. But their trail is dogged by the sinister Harlen Maguire (Jude Law), a photographer who ""shoots the dead"" and has been hired to kill Sullivan and young Michael. Along the way, as father and son must work together to survive, we see the initially strained relationship between Sullivan and Michael develop into something deeper and more real. In contrast, we also see the painful inner conflict John Rooney feels at having to choose between his two sons, the real and the adopted.Despite being a gangster movie, it is not an action film and the focus is undeniably on the internal, emotional struggles the characters face rather than on the external events. Genre is only a vehicle here. The plot is cohesive, thought-provoking, and holds one's attention throughout. My only disappointment, though it is a slight one, is in finding myself vaguely unsatisfied with the way the story is wrapped up. The climax of the story is powerful, and gives the film a sense of resolution, but the brief denoument somehow didn't quite seem to fit. Nevertheless, I do think this is one of the better films of 2002.Every single actor turned in an excellent performance, making this film surprisingly powerful and compelling. The character of Michael Sullivan is an unusual one for Tom Hanks, whom we're used to seeing as the good guy. Here he draws out a darker element, playing the role of a professional killer. Yet at the same time he manages to convey a compassionate, human side to the man, which we see manifested in the love he feels for his son. Paul Newman also does an outstanding job, as is to be expected. Jude Law's character will positively make your skin crawl. And newly discovered child actor Tyler Hoechlin is impressive as young Michael, giving a very genuine performance, rare for most actors his age.""Road to Perdition"" is also a great artistic success. The cinematography is perfect. The use of light and darkness gives a great effect. The colors are muted, creating a brooding atmosphere, and also giving the film an authentic ""feel"" of the Depression era in which the story takes place. The sets are simple and uncluttered, yet retain a rich, textured feel. Some scenes were also shot on location in older parts of Chicago. The soundtrack (by Thomas Newman) adds the final finishing touch. All originally composed for this film, the music is truly beautiful. Heavily piano-driven, it conveys an additional depth of emotion that makes the movie feel complete.The DVD Special Features include commentary from director Sam Mendes, several interesting deleted scenes which can be watched either with or without commentary, an HBO ""Making of Road to Perdition"" documentary featuring actor and filmmaker interviews that provide some interesting insights, an advertisement for the soundtrack, cast and filmmaker bios, production notes, and a photo gallery. I'd certainly recommend this film to others, as either a rental or a purchase. It's worth more than one viewing (though it's a ""heavy"" movie and not the sort you'd want to watch every day), and I liked it enough to add it to my own DVD collection.",4,"""There is only one guarantee.

Brilliantly shot and acted, this is one of the greats, in my opinion.Michael Sullivan (Hanks) is an enforcer for an Irish mafia boss, (Newman), with a simple ethic in life. He also has an abiding fear that his sons will grow up just like him and follow him into the business. Soon enough, however, the internal politics of the Rooney family overtake the Sullivans as Connor Rooney (Craig) makes a move and ends up wiping out Sullivan's family. Michael Sullivan Jr and Michael Sullivan Sr take to the road and try to level things out. Throw in a profession assassin with a proclivity to maccabre art (Law) and you have a complex plot that keeps one in the zone.As mentioned, the cinematography is excellent, with some amazing scenes that are truly artistic. The filming was excellent, and matched by the great acting from Newman, Hanks, Law and many others. Portraying hard men in a hard lifestyle is something they all did very well.Overall, this film is without doubt a very memorable one and one that is worth sitting through a number of times.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 2]","With all the critical praise and the handful of Academy Awards that were bestowed on American Beauty, director Sam Mendes had a lot to live up to with his follow up film.  Based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, Road to Perdition tells the story of Irish mob hitman Mike Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who, along with his pre-teen son, are on the run while he seeks revenge on his former partner who murdered his family.  Hanks gives one of his better (but not his best) performances as he tries to against his typical good guy roles (a la an Oscar winning Denzel Washington), but in the end he comes out being a likeable character nonetheless.  Paul Newman (in an Oscar nominated performance) chews up as much screen time as he can, but his best moments are when he and Hanks share the screen together.  The standout performance however, goes to Jude Law as a picture taking hitman sent after Hanks and son, and while his screen time is limited, Law is simply chilling and gives us the film's most memorable role.  Mendes' directing is slow paced, but that doesn't take anything away from the film thanks to the gorgeous cinematography that set this tale of redemption and revenge apart from other films of its' genre.

That is quite a comment isn't it given that Speilberg is only credited as part of the Dreamworks team which produced this picture. The fact is that the man's hands are all over this one in the same way that he ""directed"" Poltergeist - but didn't. Speilberg has often been accused of using too much ""over-sentimentality"" in his films. I would semi-agree with this analysis but it doesn't show through too often which is fine - except here in this picture that is dripping and oozing sentimentality from every single frame. I am sorry but this film is tugging at heart strings from the word go and is pulling every trick in the book to try and get the emotional out of you. It reaches a point about twenty minutes into the film where you just say - ""Okay, okay I get it, now please, the story, move on with that and some character development, thank you."" - but Speilberg is there behind an Oscar-begging Mendes (isn't one Oscar enough??) saying ""Go on boy you can do it, tug those strings, more! More! Pluck `em till they have a stroke!""The fact is that this film does so much on the sentimentality front that it is not just annoying, but downright damaging to the movie and everyone who has anything to do with it. It is a misfire in direction, acting and production. How can you take a great story, a great concept, and flat out destroy it from frame to frame by seeing how much sentimentality the audience can take.

They snubbed this movie because it obviously stood there before them saying - come on gimme the gold! AND IT DOES JUST THAT! How embarrassing! There is nothing worse than begging for an Oscar and boy does it beg!It simply does not make any sense that no one in the studio said - ""Hey, listen guys Don't you think we should tone down on the old sentimentality here for a moment because it is extremely distracting?&quot; It seems that no one even considered that this piece of cinema was about to go to mush under all the mushyness.

He decided that he has to kill Michael, in effect choosing his own son over Michael.  After Michael's wife and other son are killed by the mobsters, he is forced to go on the lamb with his son, while being chased by an assasin (Jude Law).The details in the movie are astounding.  Much like the rose petals in American Beauty, rain is a constant theme in ""Perdition.""Upon seeing this movie, we are faced with one very interesting question, Michael Sullivan was a gangster.  He killed many men and robbed many banks to protect his son.  Was he a hero in protecting his son?  Or was he still just a gangster because he killed to do so?See the movie and decide for yourself.

597954,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00005JLBQ,Patrick L. Randall,"[2, 3]","Certainly, there were some great intentions in the making of &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;.  Gangster movies are one of the most popular genres for the movie going public (see the &quot;Godfather&quot; movies and &quot;Goodfellas&quot; for classic examples).  Throw in the nostalgia of 1930's America and cast stellar actors like Paul Newman, Tom Hanks, Jude Law and one can't help but feel that this movie should be something special.  So, why isn't it?  In this case, the whole of the movie is decidedly less than the sum of its parts.  It's hard to pinpoint why this happens.  It just happens.  The overall feel of the movie doesn't carry the grand epic sweep of &quot;Godfather&quot;, nor does it present the harsh viciousness of &quot;Goodfellas&quot;.The story centers around a loyal gangster named Michael Sullivan(played by Hanks) who has been nothing by a devoted servant to his mentor and benefactor, a gang boss named Rooney (played by Paul Newman).  On the orders of Rooney, Sullivan (whom Rooney felt was more of a son than his own wayward offspring) and Rooney's hot-tempered son go to rough up a disgruntled former associated.  While Sullivan only intends to put some fear into him, Rooney's son goes crazy and kills him, necessitating Sullivan killing the other henchmen in the room.  Alas, all this was witnessed by Sullivan's older boy, Michael Jr., who stowed away in the car because he wanted to know what it was that his father really did for a living.  Rooney's son decides this is unacceptable and later goes to Sullivan's house and kills his wife and younger son.  Thus, to protect his only remaining son and to exact appropriate revenge against Rooney's son, and Rooney for not punishing him for that act, Sullivan takes to the road with Michael Jr.The setup seems like it should power the remainder of an excellent story.  Unfortunately, &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; loses its way.  For big portions of the middle of the movie, it acts like it would rather be a father/son bonding movie rather than a gangster film.  While such a juxtaposition has been achieved in the past (Vito and Michael Corleone come to mind), here it just feels like 'filler' until the climax of the movie is reached.  It's not to say that &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; is a bad movie.  It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination.  It is quite well done.  Unfortunately, it's a movie that should pack an emotional punch, but just leaves the viewer feeling flat.",3,"Polished, but ultimately flat, movie",1051833600,"05 2, 2003",2003,2465,"['Certainly', 'were', 'great', 'intentions', 'making', 'quot', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'quot', 'Gangster', 'movies', 'are', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'genres', 'movie', 'going', 'public', 'see', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'movies', 'quot', 'Goodfellas', 'quot', 'classic', 'examples', 'Throw', 'nostalgia', '1930', 'America', 'cast', 'stellar', 'actors', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Jude', 'Law', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'something', 'special', 'So', 'why', ""n't"", 'case', 'whole', 'movie', 'decidedly', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'why', 'just', 'overall', 'feel', 'movie', ""n't"", 'carry', 'grand', 'epic', 'sweep', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'present', 'harsh', 'viciousness', 'quot', 'Goodfellas', 'quot', '.The', 'story', 'centers', 'loyal', 'gangster', 'named', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'played', 'Hanks', 'who', 'been', 'nothing', 'devoted', 'servant', 'mentor', 'benefactor', 'gang', 'boss', 'named', 'Rooney', 'played', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'orders', 'Rooney', 'Sullivan', 'whom', 'Rooney', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'son', 'own', 'wayward', 'offspring', 'Rooney', 'hot-tempered', 'son', 'go', 'rough', 'up', 'disgruntled', 'former', 'associated', 'Sullivan', 'only', 'put', 'fear', 'Rooney', 'son', 'crazy', 'necessitating', 'Sullivan', 'killing', 'other', 'henchmen', 'room', 'Alas', 'was', 'witnessed', 'Sullivan', 'older', 'boy', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'who', 'stowed', 'away', 'car', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'father', 'really', 'did', 'living', 'Rooney', 'son', 'unacceptable', 'later', 'Sullivan', 'house', 'kills', 'wife', 'younger', 'son', 'Thus', 'protect', 'only', 'remaining', 'son', 'exact', 'appropriate', 'revenge', 'Rooney', 'son', 'Rooney', 'not', 'punishing', 'act', 'Sullivan', 'road', 'Michael', 'Jr.The', 'setup', 'should', 'power', 'remainder', 'excellent', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'quot', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'quot', 'way', 'big', 'portions', 'middle', 'movie', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'father/son', 'bonding', 'movie', 'rather', 'gangster', 'film', 'juxtaposition', 'been', 'achieved', 'past', 'Vito', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'come', 'mind', 'here', 'just', 'feels', ""'filler"", 'climax', 'movie', 'reached', 'not', 'say', 'quot', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'quot', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'should', 'pack', 'emotional', 'punch', 'just', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'flat']",N/A

Mike Sullivan is a successful hit-man for the Chicago mob when he unexpectedly finds himself the target of his erstwhile employer. Mike's 12 year old son, believing his father to be a secret agent for the government, hid in his father's car to watch him on a secret mission. That mission turned out to be the brutal murder of a mobster suspected of double-crossing the mob boss.The mob boss (played by Paul Newman) decides that it is too risky to have a child as a witness to a mob hit, so orders the murder of Mike and his immediate family. Mike's wife and youngest son are murdered but Mike and oldest son survive. Thus begins their journey of reconciliation and revenge.Mike teaches son how to drive a getaway car and they proceed to steal from the mob by holding up banks known to be depositories of mob cash. Incensed, the mob engage the best hit-man they have (apart from Mike) to kill our heroes. This fellow is a psychopath that likes to photograph his victims as they gasp their last breath.The bulk of the movie documents the ups and downs of Mike and psychopath killing assorted mobsters and bystanders as Mike seeks revenge on the people that murdered his family, and psychopath seeks to stop Mike.

597961,A292YWWNFVSIWY,B00005JLBQ,Publius,"[1, 1]","Some movies are just so beautifully filmed that one can watch the movie over and over despite a lack of plot or good story.  ""Road to Perdition"" is the rare example of a movie that has a compelling story with excellent cinematography.  The story in ""Road"" has been told several times in several different cultures.  There is nothing new with a gangster film with the traditional cat and mouse chase thrown in.  The movie opens and closes with scenes that have an overabundance of light, while everything in between is shrouded in darkness.  Some directors seem to want to fill every available film space with music or sound tracks.  Director Mendes does not fall into this clich&eacute; however.  Two scenes come to mind where Mendes uses the lack of music or sound to great effect.  One is towards the end of the movie where Hanks' character guns down the remaining members of Rooney's thugs.  Instead of hearing the shrill sound of several Tommy Guns go off at the same time, we instead see foggy gangsters falling one after another with no sound whatsoever except for Newman's haunting score.  When Sullivan finally guns down Newman's Rooney, we do hear these shots thereby making this killing all the more chilling.  The second example is at the very end of the movie where Jude Law's Maguire character faces off with the Sullivans in the cottage by the lake.  The average director may pack this tension filled scene with nervous instrumentation.  Instead, Mendes gives us no music, but just the sounds of the waves crashing on the Lake Michigan shore.  This silence heightens the tension rather then downplaying it.  ""Road to Perdition"" came out during the middle of the summer when the average movie consisted of action movies having large budgets and even larger explosions.  ""Road"" did fairly well at the box office with Tom Hanks/Paul Newman's star power but many people who came to see this intelligent movie were probably tired of brainless action movies.  It would be good if Hollywood turned out a movie like this every once in a while, during the summer, to appeal to the viewer that may be tired of movies that the Jerry Bruckheimer cookie cutter machine cranks out.  Just one caveat: you should not look to ""Road"" as a gangster movie in the same vein as ""The Godfather"" or ""Goodfellas.""  Instead, it is a simple father-son movie disguised as a gangster flick.  This father-son motif is evident in many movies but is disguised many ways.  ""Field of Dreams"" had this motif as a baseball movie, while ""Star Wars"" couched the motif in the middle of intergalactic warfare.  Much praise should be given to Thomas Newman's beautiful score in the film as well.

597969,A38ELBK7FLXGOY,B00005JLBQ,Richard Wells,"[6, 8]","""The Road to Perdition,"" is a highly stylized gangster movie that succeeds as a theatrical motion picture, but will probably leave fans of the quick cut to cynicism untouched.Sam Mendes is a man of the theater, (this in only his second movie,) and visually, ""The Road to Perdition"" is as much an exercise in theatrical staging as it is a vehicle for motion.  Mr. Mendes is a fan of the long take, and he uses it to great effect.It's a simple story.  Tom Hanks play Michael Sullivan, a hit man.  His son, Michael, Jr., witnesses a warehouse slaughter in which his father takes part.  The local crime lord's son spurs the events, and therein we have two fathers, two sons, and the extremes of fathers' protecting their issue.  For the Sullivan's, a redemptive road trip to the village of Perdition; for the Rooney's, Paul Newman and Daniel Craig, a ride to perdition proper without benefit of the open road.  Along the way there is enough violence, blood, and gore to keep us all happy; but there's also heartbreak, wit, and visual intelligence.The film is well cast, with Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Jude Law playing against type, and the leads and supports inhabiting their roles.  Tom Hanks, also playing against type, is stoic and closed and has Michael Sullivan under his skin.  Michael, Jr., played by Tyler Hoechlin, is nothing short of angelic, albeit a dark angel.  Paul Newman, with relatively little screen time, is a wonder to behold, and his work is a fine addition to his later career.  May he make movies for some time to come.""The Road to Perdition"" feels good without being a feel-good movie, and the reason it feels that way is because the road is steep, and the redemption is hard-won.",5,Hard Won Redemption,1026691200,"07 15, 2002",2002,1700,"['Road', 'Perdition', 'highly', 'stylized', 'gangster', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'motion', 'picture', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'fans', 'quick', 'cut', 'cynicism', 'untouched.Sam', 'Mendes', 'man', 'theater', 'only', 'second', 'movie', 'visually', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'as', 'much', 'exercise', 'theatrical', 'staging', 'vehicle', 'motion', 'Mr.', 'Mendes', 'fan', 'long', 'take', 'great', 'effect.It', 'simple', 'story', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'play', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'hit', 'man', 'son', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'warehouse', 'slaughter', 'father', 'part', 'local', 'crime', 'lord', 'son', 'events', 'therein', 'have', 'two', 'fathers', 'two', 'sons', 'extremes', 'fathers', 'protecting', 'issue', 'Sullivan', 'redemptive', 'road', 'trip', 'village', 'Perdition', 'Rooney', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'ride', 'perdition', 'benefit', 'open', 'road', 'way', 'enough', 'violence', 'blood', 'gore', 'keep', 'happy', 'also', 'heartbreak', 'wit', 'visual', 'intelligence.The', 'film', 'well', 'cast', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Jude', 'Law', 'playing', 'type', 'leads', 'supports', 'inhabiting', 'roles', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'also', 'playing', 'type', 'stoic', 'closed', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'skin', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'played', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'nothing', 'short', 'angelic', 'dark', 'angel', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'relatively', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'wonder', 'behold', 'work', 'fine', 'addition', 'later', 'career', 'May', 'make', 'movies', 'time', 'come', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'feels', 'good', 'being', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'reason', 'way', 'road', 'steep', 'redemption', 'hard-won']",N/A
597970,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B00005JLBQ,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[3, 4]","For some reason I was really looking forward to &quot;Road to Perdition.&quot; Perhaps it was because I liked Sam Mendes' first film, &quot;American Beauty,&quot; so much. Or maybe it was the fact that Thomas Newman, one of my new favorite composers, wrote the score for the film. It could have been that Tom Hanks doesn't usually play this sort of role, or that it's a film based on a pretty good graphic novel, a fact which seemed played down in many circles.One thing I can say is don't go seeing this movie expecting anything like &quot;American Beauty.&quot; &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; is a completely different sort of story, and as a smart director Mendes abandons the directorial tricks that made &quot;American Beauty&quot; so unique in favor of telling this story the way it needed to be told.And it is actually a very good story. In one sense, it's a &quot;mob movie,&quot; since it involves American organized crime in the early 20th century. However, it's not a mob film like Coppola's Godfather series or Scorcese's &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; which are great in their own right. Where those movies are ensemble films about a whole family, &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; is a much more personal story, about one man who discovers that it is too late for him to be redeemed and live a good life, but it may not be too late for his son. After his younger son and wife are killed, he sets out with his eldest son to find a new life for them both.Though it was hard to picture him as a gangster when I first heard about this film, Tom Hanks was ideally suited to this role, and I can see why he was cast. I think he's a fine actor in many of his movies, but in &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; he really stretched himself. His character early on seems almost to lead a double life: a relatively normal life with his family, and his business life as an enforcer for his mafia associates. And yet he plays both sides well. At home he is obviously a loving father, though unsure and hesitant about how to reach his older son. He's far from perfect, but he plays a plausible man struggling with the realities of raising children. In his work, he is businesslike and professional. He is not brutal by nature, but he can be when the work calls for it. In the end, he's simply good at what he does. However, when the elder son hides away and witnesses his father at work, that all falls apart. The rest of the film shows Hanks' character trying to reconcile the two halves of his psyche, even as he's trying to find a safe place for his son, and maybe for himself. His struggles are real, and they are palpable. Hanks played it up just right, but not too much. I was impressed and pleased by his performance.When I mentioned earlier that Sam Mendes abandoned his previous visual tricks for &quot;Road to Perdition,&quot; that's not to say that it doesn't have its own visual style. Rather, what he did was to create a new style for this film, one which addresses its own needs more efficiently. Where &quot;American Beauty&quot; was a story told with flourishes and idiosyncrasies, as befit the theme of the film, &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; adopts a much simpler, more straightforward tone. There are moments of beauty and moments of brutality, to be sure, but only as much as fits the events of the story. The scene in which Hanks guns down a number of his old associates is strikingly graceful, handled with a light but serious touch. Without giving the end away, I can say that the final scenes were among the most perfect in the film, and leave the audience thinking about the conclusion long after the credits have rolled.All this sounds like I really enjoyed the movie, and basically, I guess I did. I certainly don't regret spending time and money to see it, and I definitely enjoyed it while I was there. Technically, it's a strong story, skillfully put together. The acting was good all around. There were no major flaws in it that I noticed.And yet, emotionally, it left me sort of flat. I think that in the end, it wanted to be a movie that moved the audience in some way, that made them feel. For me, it just didn't. It's funny, because I had the same problem with &quot;American Beauty,&quot; and the only difference there is that I don't think &quot;American Beauty&quot; was trying to make you feel - it was trying to make you think. In that sense, it was a success. Which is not to say that &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; is a failure at all. I wouldn't say the movie failed, but I wouldn't say it completely succeeded either. When I think about it now, it just sort of... exists, neither a success nor a failure. I admire many things about it, from a technical perspective and a storytelling perspective. But, if indeed it was trying to make me feel something beyond the surface for the characters, then I can't say it did that for me.Perhaps Mendes is a director who prefers to leave the audience's feelings to the audience. Rather than manipulating them with music or powerful visuals as other directors tend to do, he leaves the emotional side of the story to what the audience chooses to invest in it. &quot;The audience makes the film,&quot; Peter Weir has said in the past, and perhaps this is Sam Mendes' theory as well. Regardless of the theory behind his style, his methods seems sound. &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; is a good film, and worth seeing. Perhaps any other judgments on it are best reserved for the audience to decide for themselves.",4,"Well-made, but vaguely lacking in emotion",1065830400,"10 11, 2003",2003,5471,"['reason', 'was',

597972,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JLBQ,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","This movie has many, many great things to recommend it.  The cinematography and art direction are first rate.  The casting is very good, I think.  Tom Hanks as an ""enforcer"" for the mob is not terribly hard to buy.  He does his job because its what he owes to his boss, who was like a father to him, and its what keeps his family living a nice life.  He works hard to keep his family insulated from what he does for a living, and Hanks is right for the part. We know him as a nice guy.  He's trustworthy and personable.  In this film, he leads a double life...he kills people.  And that is a bit jarring for us, the viewer.  However, we don't actually see him doing his job very often, and in one critical early scene, he's actually NOT planning on killing the guy...it's his bosses crazy son that does it, and that's where the trouble starts, because Hanks' son witnesses this killing, and suddenly, Hank's family is a target, and thus, all his efforts to shield his family from the reality of what he does come crashing tragically down around him.Paul Newman is terrific as the boss.  He's a ""gentle"" soul with the true heart of a killer.  Newman is a master of underplaying.  His eyes tell us almost all we need to know, and the rest is conveyed in his husky voice.  We should all age as openly and gracefully as Paul Newman!Jude Law plays a hit man hired to track down and kill Hanks.  What a crazy character he is...a photographer who enjoys photographing the moment his victims die.  We've seen this sort of psychopath before, but to see it in a ""period"" piece rather than in modern times is a bit jarring.  Law limps, has bad teeth and is just generally disgusting.  He's a killer WITHOUT a gentle side.  Is this more honest than Hanks' split personality?  This is one of the questions I think the movie quietly explores.The movie is not fast-paced, but I don't think it drags.  It tells its story with respect for storytelling, rather than a need to have shooting all the time.  Yet there is plenty of action and there are many tense moments, particularly between Hanks and Law, who have some memorable confrontations, particularly when they are in a crowded diner together, and Hanks realises who Law is and what he has been sent to do.About halfway through the movie, Hanks and his son, who are on the lam from retribution, decide they need to make a statement to the boss.  Hanks decides they need to rob all the banks where the mob keeps its money, in order to get their attention.  He and his son have several ""wacky"" bank-holdup scenes, with Hanks being very amusing with the bemused bank tellers, and his young son being funny learning how to drive by being the getaway driver.  The scenes are fun...you can imagine Speilberg directing them.  Yet they are untrue to the tone of the movie.  These two people have just recently lost the rest of their family very violently, and their lives have become hell.  Yet suddenly, they are in a screwball comedy!!  I'm sure director Sam Mendes felt the audience needed a break from all the bleakness, but ultimately, these scenes betray the characters, and that's why the movie only gets 4 stars from me.BUT any discerning moviegoer should see this movie...it's one of the 10 best of the year, I think.",4,"lntriguing, captivating and a bit hard to believe",1046304000,"02 27, 2003",2003,3257,"['movie', 'many', 'many', 'great', 'things', 'recommend', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'casting', 'very', 'good', 'think', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'enforcer', 'mob', 'not', 'terribly', 'hard', 'buy', 'job', 'what', 'boss', 'who', 'was', 'father', 'what', 'family', 'living', 'nice', 'life', 'hard', 'keep', 'family', 'insulated', 'what', 'living', 'Hanks', 'right', 'part', 'know', 'nice', 'guy', 'trustworthy', 'personable', 'film', 'double', 'life', 'people', 'bit', 'jarring', 'viewer', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'see', 'doing', 'job', 'very', 'often', 'one', 'critical', 'early', 'scene', 'actually', 'NOT', 'planning', 'killing', 'guy', 'bosses', 'crazy', 'son', 'where', 'trouble', 'Hanks', 'son', 'killing', 'suddenly', 'Hank', 'family', 'target', 'thus', 'efforts', 'shield', 'family', 'reality', 'what', 'come', 'crashing', 'tragically', 'down', 'around', 'him.Paul', 'Newman', 'terrific', 'boss', 'gentle', 'soul', 'true', 'heart', 'killer', 'Newman', 'master', 'underplaying', 'eyes', 'tell', 'almost', 'need', 'know', 'rest', 'conveyed', 'husky', 'voice', 'should', 'age', 'openly', 'gracefully', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Jude', 'Law', 'hit', 'man', 'hired', 'track', 'down', 'kill', 'Hanks', 'What', 'crazy', 'character', 'photographer', 'who', 'photographing', 'moment', 'victims', 'die', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'sort', 'psychopath', 'see', 'period', 'piece', 'rather', 'modern', 'times', 'bit', 'jarring', 'Law', 'limps', 'bad', 'teeth', 'just', 'generally', 'disgusting', 'killer', 'gentle', 'side', 'more', 'honest', 'Hanks', 'split', 'personality', 'one', 'questions', 'think', 'movie', 'quietly', 'explores.The', 'movie', 'not', 'fast-paced', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'story', 'respect', 'storytelling', 'rather', 'need', 'have', 'shooting', 'time', 'plenty', 'action', 'are', 'many', 'tense', 'moments', 'particularly', 'Hanks', 'Law', 'who', 'have', 'memorable', 'confrontations', 'particularly', 'when', 'are', 'crowded', 'diner', 'together', 'Hanks', 'realises', 'who', 'Law', 'what', 'been', 'sent', 'do.About', 'halfway', 'movie', 'Hanks', 'son', 'who', 'are', 'lam', 'retribution', 'need', 'make', 'statement', 'boss', 'Hanks', 'need', 'rob', 'banks', 'where', 'mob', 'money', 'order', 'get', 'attention', 'son', 'have', 'several', 'wacky', 'bank-holdup', 'scenes', 'Hanks', 'being', 'very', 'amusing', 'bemused', 'bank', 'tellers', 'young', 'son', 'being', 'funny', 'learning', 'how', 'drive', 'being', 'getaway', 'driver', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'can', 'imagine', 'Speilberg', 'directing', 'are', 'untrue', 'tone', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'have', 'just', 'recently', 'lost', 'rest', 'family', 'very', 'violently', 'lives', 'have', 'become', 'hell', 'suddenly', 'are', 'screwball', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'felt', 'audience', 'needed', 'break', 'bleakness', 'ultimately', 'scenes', 'betray', 'characters', 'why', 'movie', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'me.BUT', 'discerning', 'moviegoer', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'one', '10', 'best', 'year', 'think']",N/A
597973,A2MJKH6DQIKTM3,B00005JLBQ,Robert Amsel,"[2, 3]","I have a little problem with movies based on graphic novels, but then, graphic novels are a bit like storyboards, and since movies are a visual medium, I can see why producers and directors might find them appealing as source material.  And yet even the best graphic novel seems superficial compared to the best non-graphic novel, which provides the actors more depth of character and complexity with which to work, even though the finished product is still an abridgement of the original.""The Road to Perdition"" is sensitively directed by Sam Mendes, exquisitely photographed by Conrad Hall, finely acted by everyone in it, with particular cudos for Paul Newman, Jude Law, and Daniel Craig.  Costumes and set designs are also superior in recreating Chicago and environs during the early 1930s.But I had a few problems with plot logistics that I never quite got over.  Tom Hanks plays a loyal hitman of many years standing for mob boss Paul Newman.  In fact, Newman allegedly regards Hanks as the son he wished he had, rather than the trigger-happy idiot he's stuck with (beautifully portrayed by Daniel Craig). When Hanks's elder son witnesses his father in action, Newman arranges an attempted hit on both Hanks and the boy, an attempted hit that backfires and results in tragedy for the remainder of Hanks's family, setting the rest of this gangland drama into motion.  Unless I'm missing something, I don't believe for a moment that the Newman character would arrange for a hit on his well-loved ""adopted"" son Hanks or the boy, since the boy, though a witness to murder, is hardly going to rat on his own father (or on Newman's own son, also involved, which again would lead back to Hanks).  In order for the rest of the movie to work -- in which Hanks has no choice but to seek revenge if he and his son are to survive -- a viewer must have to accept the premise that sets the film into motion, and this viewer cannot.I also had a problem with a scene in which Jude Law, as a particularly effective psychotic killer on Hanks's tail, seems to know exactly what diner Tom Hanks is going to eat at.  What psychic hotline for psychotics does Law subscribe to?  True, Law has figured out that Hanks and son are on their way to the small town of Perdition, but are we to assume that this particular diner is the ONLY eating place along the way?  Or is the diner just a particular favorite with ALL hitmen?  To suspend disbelief, must I suspend logic too?  If a viewer can climb over such hurdles as the two mentioned above, there is a great deal to recommend the remainder of the film in every category mentioned above, particularly the growing relationship of Hanks and son as they continue to thwart danger.",3,Another Graphic Novel Hits the Screen,1040774400,"12 25, 2002",2002,2708,"['have', 'little', 'problem', 'movies', 'based', 'graphic', 'novels', 'then', 'graphic', 'novels', 'are', 'bit', 'storyboards', 'movies', 'are', 'visual', 'medium', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'producers', 'directors', 'might', 'find', 'appealing', 'source', 'material', 'yet', 'even', 'best', 'graphic', 'novel', 'superficial', 'compared', 'best', 'non-graphic', 'novel', 'actors', 'more', 'depth', 'character', 'complexity', 'work', 'even', 'finished', 'product', 'still', 'abridgement', 'original', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'sensitively', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'exquisitely', 'photographed', 'Conrad', 'Hall', 'finely', 'acted', 'everyone', 'particular', 'cudos', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Costumes', 'set', 'designs', 'are', 'also', 'superior', 'recreating', 'Chicago', 'environs', 'early', '1930s.But', 'had', 'few', 'problems', 'plot', 'logistics', 'never', 'quite', 'got', 'over', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'loyal', 'hitman', 'many', 'years', 'standing', 'mob', 'boss', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'fact', 'Newman', 'allegedly', 'Hanks', 'son', 'wished', 'had', 'rather', 'trigger-happy', 'idiot', 'stuck', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'When', 'Hanks', 'elder', 'son', 'father', 'action', 'Newman', 'attempted', 'hit', 'Hanks', 'boy', 'attempted', 'hit', 'results', 'tragedy', 'remainder', 'Hanks', 'family', 'setting', 'rest', 'gangland', 'drama', 'motion', ""'m"", 'missing', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'moment', 'Newman', 'character', 'would', 'arrange', 'hit', 'well-loved', 'adopted', 'son', 'Hanks', 'boy', 'boy', 'witness', 'murder', 'hardly', 'going', 'rat', 'own', 'father', 'Newman', 'own', 'son', 'also', 'involved', 'again', 'would', 'lead', 'back', 'Hanks', 'order', 'rest', 'movie', 'work', 'Hanks', 'choice', 'seek', 'revenge', 'son', 'are', 'survive', 'viewer', 'must', 'have', 'accept', 'premise', 'film', 'motion', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', '.I', 'also', 'had', 'problem', 'scene', 'Jude', 'Law', 'particularly', 'effective', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'Hanks', 'tail', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'diner', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'going', 'eat', 'What', 'psychic', 'hotline', 'psychotics', 'Law', 'subscribe', 'True', 'Law', 'figured', 'out', 'Hanks', 'son', 'are', 'way', 'small', 'town', 'Perdition', 'are', 'assume', 'particular', 'diner', 'ONLY', 'eating', 'place', 'way', 'diner', 'just', 'particular', 'favorite', 'hitmen', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'must', 'suspend', 'logic', 'too', 'viewer', 'can', 'climb', 'such', 'hurdles', 'two', 'mentioned', 'great', 'deal', 'recommend', 'remainder', 'film', 'category', 'mentioned', 'particularly', 'growing', 'relationship', 'Hanks', 'son', 'continue', 'thwart', 'danger']",N/A
597974,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JLBQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 5]","Road to Perdition (Sam Mendes, 2002)After Sam Mendes won Best Director for American Beauty, he basically had his pick of stars for film #2. He lined up the hooks, set the bait, and they bit in spades. That makes Road to Perdition somewhat hard to absorb oneself in; the number of big names to be found in it keeps the viewer at a professional distance, but the movie, after a quite rocky beginning, does manage to at least pull the viewer in enough to want to watch the rest of it.While Tom Hanks and Paul Newman got the big billing on the marquees, the real star of the film is relative newcomer Tyler Hoechlin, who has been since making a name for himself on TV series Seventh Heaven. Hoechlin plays Michael Sullivan, Jr., the son of Michael Sullivan (Hanks), a gangster in the employ of New York (one assumes, from some comments made by certain characters, that the movie opens somewhere in a suburb of New York City) crime boss John Rooney (Newman). At a wake for their compatriot Danny McGovern, his brother Finn (Ciaran Hinds, just as good here as he was in Calendar Girls) has a bit too much to drink and is stopped just short of accusing Rooney of dealing crooked with his outfit. Sullivan and Rooney's son, the sadistic dilettante Connor (Daniel Craig, recently of Enduring Love and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider), are dispatched to talk to Finn about his accusations. Michael Jr., curious about his father's job, hides in the car, discovering that his father is, in fact, a hit man. Such knowledge is a dangerous thing, and the rest of the plot hinges on what happens when Rooney finds out.He wake, which covers roughly the first ten minutes of the film, is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. Mendes shows us in no uncertain terms that American Beauty was not a fluke, handling the scene like a seasoned pro. Unfortunately, the next scenes (everything else in the synopsis above) disintegrate into a confusing jumble that obviously exists for the sole purpose of getting us to the meat of the movie. To make it worse, some of the bit parts found in this murky soup, especially that of In and Out's Kevin Chamberlin, are the best to be found in the film.The upshot is that before we get to the unfolding of the movie's actual plot, we're close to halfway through the film. More good performances crop up here, all of which consist of very little screen time for some very big names, including Jude Law and Stanley Tucci. It's after the movie gets to this point that it becomes a movie, as opposed to a series of set pieces. If you make it that far, don't give in to the temptation to turn it off and throw the DVD across the room, because the good stuff's on its way.But since his name tops the marquee, the big question is: how does Tom Hanks play a bad guy? After all, one cannot but call his career inconsistent over the years. For every Big or Saving Private Ryan, there's been a That Thing You Do! Or He Knows You're Alone. Most of the time, Hanks is far more effective in the role than one would expect; much of this is accomplished by Hanks not having terribly much screen time in the movie, all told. You know he's a bad guy, and he does various bad things, and Mendes seems to have realized that the best way to get audiences to buy Tom Hanks as a bad guy is to either keep him mostly offscreen when he's doing bad things, or keep the bad things offscreen while focusing on him. (The main exception to this rule comes at the very end of the film, and in no small part because Hanks has been offscreen when killing people most of the time, it is quite effective.)The downside to this is that Hanks' character really ISN'T a bad guy. He's an ambivalent guy who, as mentioned, just happens to do bad things. Without having read Max Allan Collins' novel, I can't say whether the character was transferred to the film wholesale or whether he was changed, in this way, for the movie. Which doesn't matter in the end, but it does lend a grave weakness to those scenes where Hanks is doing bad things and the camera is focusing on him instead of said bad things. (There is one scene in particular, about three-quarters of the way through the film, where his facial expression is so unintentionally hysterical the whole film comes close to unraveling.)The film has good points and bad points both, but finally, the good points win out by a slim margin. Road to Perdition is worth seeing, especially when one considers that it is part of the rapidly-dwindling-in-ratio body of film in which Tom Hanks shows that, yes, he really can act. Too bad he's upstaged by a fourteen-year-old in most every scene where they appear together. ***",3,"Overrated, but not bad.",1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,4633,"['Road', 'Perdition', 'Sam', 'Mendes', '2002', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'won', 'Best', 'Director', 'American', 'Beauty', 'basically', 'had', 'pick', 'stars', 'film', '2', 'lined', 'up', 'hooks', 'set', 'bait', 'bit', 'spades', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'somewhat', 'absorb', 'number', 'big', 'names', 'be', 'found', 'viewer', 'professional', 'distance', 'movie', 'quite', 'rocky', 'beginning', 'manage', 'least', 'pull', 'viewer', 'enough', 'want', 'watch', 'rest', 'it.While', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'got', 'big', 'billing', 'marquees', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'who', 'been', 'making', 'name', 'TV', 'series', 'Seventh', 'Heaven', 'Hoechlin', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Jr.', 'son', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Hanks', 'gangster', 'employ', 'New', 'York', 'one', 'comments', 'made', 'certain', 'characters', 'movie', 'somewhere', 'suburb', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'crime', 'boss', 'John', 'Rooney', 'Newman', 'wake', 'compatriot', 'Danny', 'McGovern', 'brother', 'Finn', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'just', 'good', 'here', 'was', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'drink', 'stopped', 'just', 'short', 'accusing', 'Rooney', 'dealing', 'crooked', 'outfit', 'Sullivan', 'Rooney', 'son', 'sadistic', 'dilettante', 'Connor', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'recently', 'Enduring', 'Love', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'are', 'dispatched', 'talk', 'Finn', 'accusations', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'curious', 'father', 'job', 'hides', 'car', 'discovering', 'father', 'fact', 'hit', 'man', 'Such', 'knowledge', 'dangerous', 'thing', 'rest', 'plot', 'what', 'when', 'Rooney', 'out.He', 'wake', 'roughly', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'Mendes', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'American', 'Beauty', 'was', 'not', 'fluke', 'handling', 'scene', 'seasoned', 'pro', 'Unfortunately', 'next', 'scenes', 'everything', 'else', 'synopsis', 'disintegrate', 'confusing', 'jumble', 'obviously', 'sole', 'purpose', 'getting', 'meat', 'movie', 'make', 'worse', 'bit', 'parts', 'found', 'murky', 'soup', 'especially', 'Out', 'Kevin', 'Chamberlin', 'are', 'best', 'be', 'found', 'film.The', 'upshot', 'get', 'unfolding', 'movie', 'actual', 'plot', ""'re"", 'close', 'halfway', 'film', 'More', 'good', 'performances', 'crop', 'up', 'here', 'consist', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'very', 'big', 'names', 'including', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'movie', 'point', 'movie', 'opposed', 'series', 'set', 'pieces', 'make', 'far', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'temptation', 'turn', 'off', 'throw', 'DVD', 'room', 'good', 'stuff', 'way.But', 'name', 'marquee', 'big', 'question', 'how', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'play', 'bad', 'guy', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'call', 'career', 'inconsistent', 'years', 'Big', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'been', 'Thing', 'Do', ""'re"", 'Alone', 'Most', 'time', 'Hanks', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'role', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'much', 'accomplished', 'Hanks', 'not', 'having', 'terribly', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'movie', 'told', 'know', 'bad', 'guy', 'various', 'bad', 'things', 'Mendes', 'have', 'realized', 'best', 'way', 'get', 'audiences', 'buy', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'bad', 'guy', 'keep', 'mostly', 'offscreen', 'when', 'doing', 'bad', 'things', 'keep', 'bad', 'things', 'offscreen', 'focusing', 'main', 'exception', 'rule', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'small', 'part', 'Hanks', 'been', 'offscreen', 'when', 'killing', 'people', 'most', 'time', 'quite', 'effective', 'downside', 'Hanks', 'character', 'really', ""N'T"", 'bad', 'guy', 'ambivalent', 'guy', 'who', 'mentioned', 'just', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'having', 'read', 'Max', 'Allan', 'Collins', 'novel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'character', 'was', 'transferred', 'film', 'wholesale', 'was', 'changed', 'way', 'movie', 'Which', ""n't"", 'matter', 'end', 'lend', 'grave', 'weakness', 'scenes', 'where', 'Hanks', 'doing', 'bad', 'things', 'camera', 'focusing', 'instead', 'said', 'bad', 'things', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'three-quarters', 'way', 'film', 'where', 'facial', 'expression', 'so', 'unintentionally', 'hysterical', 'whole', 'film', 'close', 'unraveling', 'film', 'good', 'points', 'bad', 'points', 'finally', 'good', 'points', 'win', 'out', 'slim', 'margin', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'worth', 'seeing', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'part', 'rapidly-dwindling-in-ratio', 'body', 'film', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'yes', 'really', 'can', 'act', 'Too', 'bad', 'upstaged', 'fourteen-year-old', 'most', 'scene', 'where', 'appear', 'together', '***']",N/A

597977,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00005JLBQ,Robert Morris,"[2, 3]","Before seeing this film for the first time, I already knew that Tom Hanks plays a hit man for the mob. Tom Hanks? As I then viewed the film, I assumed that Hanks accepted the role because he liked the script, respected director Sam Mendes, and wanted to work with Paul Newman. I also guessed (only a guess) that he wanted a role ""out of character."" That is, he wanted to depart from the Hanks persona so firmly established in earlier films, notably Splash (1984), Big (1988), Sleepless in Seattle (1993), and Forrest Gump (1994).The quality of Hanks's acting in Road to Perdition is outstanding. The same is true of others in the cast, notably Paul Newman (John Rooney), Jude Law (Maguire), Daniel Craig (Connor Rooney), and Tyler Hoechlin (Michael Sullivan, Jr.). What I did not fully realize until seeing the film again is that the older Sullivan son (not his father, played by Hanks) is the the focal point of the film, especially after brutal events which are best revealed in the film itself. Hoechlin is among the most talented of younger actors, female or male. In this film, he skillfully portrays a doting and devoted son who inadvertently becomes centrally involved in his father's career in crime. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that Rooney sees Michael Sr. as his ""true"" son. For obvious reasons, this infuriates Rooney's natural son Connor, a vicious but incompetent heir to his father's mob ""franchise.""This film is set in the 1930s. As crime became ""organized,"" certain policies and procedures were agreed upon and strictly enforced. The mobsters' model was the corporate structure, probably General Motors with its hierarchies, divisions, special units, strategic alliances, etc. Activities were organized within specific territories. In this film, Rooney (Newman) rules the Tri Cities area which consists of Moline and Rock Island, Illinois, and nearby Davenport, Iowa. He reports to a ""corporate headquarters"" located in Chicago, headed by Al Capone.With regard to the title, it refers to a journey undertaken by  the two Sullivans and others before reaching what proves to be -- for most of them -- a violent destination. Who among them will be eternally damned? The title also refers to a town to which Michael Sr. plans to take his son once he (Sr.) eliminates the threats to them both. Special credit to David Self for an extraordinarily clean and crisp script, and to Conrad L. Hall's cinematography which earned for him an Academy Award.  As for Hanks being ""out of character"" in this part, his acting skills ensure that he is every bit as credible as Michael Sr. as he is as Forrest Gump.

597978,A1JIPFV4OL520T,B00005JLBQ,Robert Wynkoop,"[0, 3]","This is an extraordinary movie about fathers and sons, a rarity in this politically correct world. It is a contrast between Mr. Rooney (Paul Newman) and his son Conner (Daniel Craig) and Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his son Michael (Tyler Hoechlin).  No more poignantly  put than when Mr. Rooney spoke to Michael Sullivan and said:  It is a natural law, sons were put on earth to trouble their fathers.  In a sense, this is true.  It is a father's mandate to help his sons grow up to be men and to have a moral center.  In this respect Mr. Rooney failed his son Conner who became an undisciplined bully; whereas, Michael, a hired killer, gives his son a legacy of a father who gave his all for his son.Not only does the story draw me back again and again, the pure beauty of the cinematography makes watching the movie an enjoyable event.  It is simply breathtaking.  Whether it is Michael Jr. riding his bike against the tide of factory workers, or the slaughter of Mr. Rooney and his henchmen is the driving rain, one would be hard pressed to find a more beautiful movie.The beauty of this movie hides the inherent violence of organized crime.  To be sure, violence is shown, but it is shown in such a way that one does not realize the depth and extent of it without some reflection. It wasn't until my third or fourth viewing that I began to realize just how many people were killed in this movie- Michael Sullivan guns down at least twelve, leaving a total body count of seventeen or more.  The innocent (Michaels wife, younger son, and the policeman); the nave (the bodyguard at the speakeasy), as well as the evil (Mr. Rooney, Conner and other henchmen) die violent deaths.  Yet, evil is not portrayed simply.  Conner Rooney and Harlen Maguire (Jude Law)  are quintessential villains; whereas Mr. Rooney and Michael Sullivan, though killers have redeeming, if not endearing qualities about them.There is an unspoken theme that weaves itself through this film, namely, the judgment of God. Mr. Rooney said, that the only certainty they can expect is that they all are going to hell.  Especially telling is the scene where Michael Sullivan assembles his Thompson machine gun in preparation for killing of Mr. Rooney and his henchmen.  As he assembles his gun, there in the background is a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.  As Sullivan turns and talks to his son, the picture remains with us, just over Michael's shoulder.  Could it be that in his fight to save his son, and to avenge the murder of his wife and youngest son that Michael becomes the angel of death, the harbinger of the judgment of God upon the Rooney family?  Interesting thought.  Think about it.",5,Angel of Death?,1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,2677,"['extraordinary', 'movie', 'fathers', 'sons', 'rarity', 'politically', 'correct', 'world', 'contrast', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'son', 'Conner', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'son', 'Michael', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'No', 'more', 'poignantly', 'put', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'spoke', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'said', 'natural', 'law', 'sons', 'were', 'put', 'earth', 'trouble', 'fathers', 'sense', 'true', 'father', 'mandate', 'help', 'sons', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'men', 'have', 'moral', 'center', 'respect', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'failed', 'son', 'Conner', 'who', 'became', 'undisciplined', 'bully', 'whereas', 'Michael', 'hired', 'killer', 'son', 'legacy', 'father', 'who', 'gave', 'all', 'son.Not', 'only', 'story', 'draw', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'pure', 'beauty', 'cinematography', 'watching', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'event', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'riding', 'bike', 'tide', 'factory', 'workers', 'slaughter', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'henchmen', 'driving', 'rain', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'more', 'beautiful', 'movie.The', 'beauty', 'movie', 'inherent', 'violence', 'organized', 'crime', 'be', 'sure', 'violence', 'shown', 'shown', 'such', 'way', 'one', 'not', 'realize', 'depth', 'extent', 'reflection', 'was', ""n't"", 'third', 'fourth', 'viewing', 'began', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'killed', 'movie-', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'down', 'least', 'twelve', 'leaving', 'total', 'body', 'count', 'seventeen', 'more', 'innocent', 'Michaels', 'wife', 'younger', 'son', 'policeman', 'nave', 'bodyguard', 'speakeasy', 'as', 'well', 'evil', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'Conner', 'other', 'henchmen', 'die', 'violent', 'deaths', 'evil', 'not', 'portrayed', 'simply', 'Conner', 'Rooney', 'Harlen', 'Maguire', 'Jude', 'Law', 'are', 'quintessential', 'villains', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'killers', 'have', 'redeeming', 'not', 'endearing', 'qualities', 'unspoken', 'theme', 'film', 'namely', 'judgment', 'God', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'said', 'only', 'certainty', 'can', 'expect', 'are', 'going', 'hell', 'Especially', 'telling', 'scene', 'where', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Thompson', 'machine', 'gun', 'preparation', 'killing', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'henchmen', 'gun', 'background', 'picture', 'Sacred', 'Heart', 'Jesus', 'Sullivan', 'talks', 'son', 'picture', 'just', 'Michael', 'shoulder', 'Could', 'be', 'fight', 'save', 'son', 'avenge', 'murder', 'wife', 'youngest', 'son', 'Michael', 'angel', 'death', 'harbinger', 'judgment', 'God', 'Rooney', 'family', 'Interesting', 'thought', 'Think']",N/A
597979,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLBQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 2]","After having made a career out of playing every kind of good guy character imaginable, Tom Hanks finally gets to strut his stuff as a bad guy - of sorts - in ""The Road to Perdition,"" Sam Mendes' excellent follow-up to his Oscar-winning ""American Beauty"" from 1999.  Of course, no one is ever going to believe Hanks as a TOTAL villain and this fact works perfectly for the role he has been called upon to play here - that of Michael Sullivan, a family man with two young boys who also happens to work as a hit man for crime boss John Rooney, an aging father figure who raised Michael as one of his own.  Sullivan's children, Michael Jr. and Peter, are in the dark as to just what it is their father does for a living, but when the older boy, Michael, witnesses one of his dad's on-the-job hits one night, he ends up putting both his and his father's lives at risk.  Suddenly, the two become fugitives, trying to stay one step ahead of the mob while Michael Sr. works on exacting revenge from Rooney's son, Connor, who both tried to have both Michaels rubbed out and succeeded in killing Michael's wife and younger son in the process.""The Road to Perdition"" deserves immense praise for featuring a less-than-savory figure as its central character.  Apart from the Hanks persona, which confers a certain automatic likeability factor onto this gangster protagonist, the film also builds the case in Michael's favor by having him be so much better than anyone else around him.  With the exception of the crime boss himself, Michael is the only one of the killers who seems to have even an iota of redeeming value to his character.  However, the film does not flinch from showing us the brutal harshness of the life fate has chosen for Michael, nor does it absolve Michael of the guilt he obviously must accept for the actions he performs.  Unlike many films, ""The Road to Perdition"" does not shy away from acknowledging the ... complexities of the character with which it is asking us to identify.  Our identification is, however, instantaneous with Michael Jr. who witnesses all this first hand and who, as events unfold, comes to understand a little something about the universal nature of father/son relationships, about the teaching and learning that takes place in the course of filial bonding, about a father's hope for a better life for his son, and about a father's instinctive need to fight for and protect his own flesh and blood even at the risk of his own life.  And Michael Sr. learns a thing or two as well about what fatherhood is really all about.  Ironically, these truths are also reflected to a certain extent in the chilling relationship between John and his own ruthless son, Connor.  These two relationships provide some intriguing parallels and contrasts which help to enrich the overall theme of the work.Despite the fact that the film focuses on the growing relationship between a father and a son, Mendes never allows sentiment to take over.  The few scenes charting the growing bond between the two Michaels are kept low-keyed and subtle and the movie erupts frequently into shocking displays of graphic violence.  One scene, in particular, in which the older Michael is ambushed in a hotel room, is extraordinarily suspenseful, executed with assured, split-second timing by director Mendes and editor, Jill Bilcock.  Mendes shows himself to be a master of the subtle moment as well, since the other great scene in the film involves a late night chat between father and son, a near-wordless encounter that underlines the growing love and respect that father and son are developing for one another.  The quiet, hushed tone of the scene provides an effective counterpoint to all the rat-a-tat-tat moments that might otherwise have come to dominate the proceedings.The performances could not be improved upon.  Hanks manages to be both stolid and emotionally vulnerable as the father who realizes that, although it may be too late to keep himself from going to ""perdition,"" it is not too late to keep his son from making the same mistake.  Newman creates a stunning portrait of an old man who can seemingly operate on two contradictory levels at the same time: one as a man capable of immense warmth and filial devotion to those he cares for and the other as a man ruthless enough to maintain his grasp on the life he's made and the position of power he's attained at any and all costs.  Jude Law achieves a perfect creepiness as the steely-eyed, sadistic and psychotic hit man sent out to dispatch both Michael and his son.  But the real acting honors go to young Tyler Hoechlin who manages to upstage even these seasoned professionals as Michael Jr., conveying in his every move, gesture and facial expression the innate innocence, warmth and intelligence of this 12-year old boy.  Hoechlin understands the quiet power that can be achieved through a look and a glance.  Wisely, the film's writer, David Self, makes young Michael an almost completely reticent character.  Most of the learning and recognition that comes to Michael over the course of the film is reflected not in his words but in his face.  As a result, little Michael is a character who lingers long in one's memory, for he ends up making an indelible mark on one's heart.Mendes does an exquisite job capturing the bleak nature of the film's early-`30's setting, although one could probably do without some of the rather improbable Bonnie and Clyde parallels that the story unfortunately wanders into.  Still, that is a minor complaint about a film that works on so many different levels simultaneously.  Beautifully crafted and brilliantly acted, ""The Road to Perdition"" is a quietly powerful film that draws us into its world in a most interesting and persuasive way.",4,excellent character

One of my favorite Bible verses is &quot;Be sure your sins will find you out.&quot;  We cannot escape some form of retribution, either in this world or the next, and this film faces this idea squarely.  A man, a good man, a family man, and also probably a murderer several times over, an arm breaker and enforcer and a father of two boys, is forced to run for his life from his old boss, and take his young son with him.  He is alone, cut off, and has only his wits and a Model A Ford and a Thompson submachine gun to see him through.  And he has his son.  I think it's a marvelous lens through which to look at many things that are both very human and very American at the same time.The movie is absolutely studded and glistening with wonderful performances.  Paul Newman and Tom Hanks together?  Fugeddaboutit.  It doesn't get any better than that.  Hanks' deep Catholic faith is juxtaposed with his ingrained warlike nature - call it hypocrisy if you must, but there are those who understand completely the forces at work in that symbiotic relationship.I couldn't bear the ending, and thought it was forced and didn't seem &quot;real&quot; to me, so I had to dock it a star.

597986,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JLBQ,Samuel McKewon,"[4, 6]","""Road To Perdition"" is a fine Saturday matinee for adults; it's appealing as a gangster potboiler, and, if choose to seek a little longer, it's appealing intellectually. I think of the Coen Brothers' ""Miller's Crossing,"" a stylish movie only enjoyable on the first level and not the second, whereas this vehicle has deeper and darker shades upon which to ruminate.Tom Hanks is a hitman and Paul Newman is his local mob boss in 1920s Illinois, a state run by the Capone crime family in Chicago. Hanks has two sons and a wife, and Newman has his son and is a widow. Newman's son, Connor (Daniel Craig) was born with a brutal streak mixed with a grown boy's petulance. You put a gun in the hands of a man like that, and innocent heads will roll.They do, sure enough, and all would be well if one of Hanks' son weren't there to see it. Connor wants the kid dead, Hanks dead, the whole family dead. He settles for two of the four. Hanks and son are forced on the road to survive, bond and plot a means of vengeance. Newman hires a traveling hitman, played by Jude Law, to track down Hanks and son.Now, onto the deeper, darker shades:1. The movie works, I think, if you understand Hanks' character is essentially nave; that is, he fails to understand the ingrained violence in his business -- yes, even though he is a hitman -- and what it might mean for even a man who does his job well. It's hardly fair that, when Hanks asks for Capone's help, assistant Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci) has to turn him down despite not wanting to. That's the illogic of the mafia; it consistently does things adverse to its well-being to stay in lockstep with its quirky ""code."" In this significant way it differs, say, a government.Hanks does not play a smart man. He is a simpleton, actually; once he understands the low odds, his recourse is just to kill them all. It's his only recourse, but a smarter man might have tried other things. It's important to note that pleading to Capone is not another thing, but a false illusion Hanks' character initially has.2. You have to accept the Greek tragedy structure. Law's character, essentially, is death, and he waits at the end of the movie as if he was always going to be there. He haunts the film. His own death is appropriate, because death will manifest itself in someone different. Law's character was merely a vessel. This idea is considered nicely in our introduction to the character; Law walks toward us and stays oddly in proportion with his surroundings; an optical trick by Conrad Hall, it's as if Law is entering from the netherworld.The tragedy structure also explains the things that are inexplicable. Why Newman would protect his worthless son, for example. Normally, mafia sons are expendable, especially in movies; consider ""The Godfather, Part II.""3. This is the best looking film of the year. Couldn't you just spend a week haunting all the sets in this film? I'd like to credit director Sam Mendes, and I will, but only because he allowed the cinematographer, the departed Conrad L. Hall, the freedom to be a virtuoso. Hall simply understands the camera; the overhead angle that opens the Tommy gun scene is obviously his idea, as is Law entrance.When awards time rolled around, ""Road To Perdition"" was overlooked, maybe because the story was a bit much. But its place on the list of many movie fans will linger, because there's much to ponder. In retrospect, this should have been a winter release, where it could reaped, oh, eight to ten nominations. What we have will have to do, but this was an outstanding film.",4,Deeper shades underneath the Saturday afternoon pulp,1050537600,"04 17, 2003",2003,3562,"['Road', 'Perdition', 'fine', 'Saturday', 'matinee', 'adults', 'appealing', 'gangster', 'potboiler', 'choose', 'seek', 'little', 'longer', 'appealing', 'intellectually', 'think', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'Miller', 'Crossing', 'stylish', 'movie', 'only', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'level', 'not', 'second', 'vehicle', 'deeper', 'darker', 'shades', 'ruminate.Tom', 'Hanks', 'hitman', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'local', 'mob', 'boss', '1920s', 'Illinois', 'state', 'run', 'Capone', 'crime', 'family', 'Chicago', 'Hanks', 'two', 'sons', 'wife', 'Newman', 'son', 'widow', 'Newman', 'son', 'Connor', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'was', 'born', 'brutal', 'streak', 'mixed', 'grown', 'boy', 'petulance', 'put', 'gun', 'hands', 'man', 'innocent', 'heads', 'will', 'roll.They', 'do', 'sure', 'enough', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'one', 'Hanks', 'son', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'see', 'Connor', 'kid', 'dead', 'Hanks', 'dead', 'whole', 'family', 'dead', 'two', 'four', 'Hanks', 'son', 'are', 'forced', 'road', 'survive', 'bond', 'plot', 'means', 'vengeance', 'Newman', 'traveling', 'hitman', 'played', 'Jude', 'Law', 'track', 'down', 'Hanks', 'son.Now', 'deeper', 'darker', 'shades:1', 'movie', 'think', 'understand', 'Hanks', 'character', 'essentially', 'nave', 'understand', 'ingrained', 'violence', 'business', 'yes', 'even', 'hitman', 'what', 'might', 'mean', 'even', 'man', 'who', 'job', 'well', 'hardly', 'fair', 'when', 'Hanks', 'Capone', 'help', 'assistant', 'Frank', 'Nitti', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'turn', 'down', 'not', 'wanting', 'illogic', 'mafia', 'consistently', 'things', 'adverse', 'well-being', 'stay', 'lockstep', 'quirky', 'code', 'significant', 'way', 'say', 'government.Hanks', 'not', 'play', 'smart', 'man', 'simpleton', 'actually', 'low', 'odds', 'recourse', 'just', 'kill', 'only', 'recourse', 'smarter', 'man', 'might', 'have', 'tried', 'other', 'things', 'important', 'note', 'pleading', 'Capone', 'not', 'thing', 'false', 'illusion', 'Hanks', 'character', 'initially', 'has.2', 'have', 'accept', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'structure', 'Law', 'character', 'essentially', 'death', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'there', 'film', 'own', 'death', 'appropriate', 'death', 'will', 'manifest', 'someone', 'different', 'Law', 'character', 'was', 'merely', 'vessel', 'idea', 'considered', 'nicely', 'introduction', 'character', 'Law', 'stays', 'oddly', 'proportion', 'surroundings', 'optical', 'trick', 'Conrad', 'Hall', 'Law', 'entering', 'netherworld.The', 'tragedy', 'structure', 'also', 'things', 'are', 'inexplicable', 'Why', 'Newman', 'would', 'protect', 'worthless', 'son', 'example', 'Normally', 'mafia', 'sons', 'are', 'expendable', 'especially', 'movies', 'consider', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II.', '3', 'best', 'looking', 'film', 'year', 'Could', ""n't"", 'just', 'spend', 'week', 'haunting', 'sets', 'film', ""'d"", 'like', 'credit', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'will', 'only', 'allowed', 'cinematographer', 'departed', 'Conrad', 'L.', 'Hall', 'freedom', 'be', 'virtuoso', 'Hall', 'simply', 'camera', 'overhead', 'angle', 'Tommy', 'gun', 'scene', 'obviously', 'idea', 'Law', 'entrance.When', 'awards', 'time', 'rolled', 'around', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'was', 'overlooked', 'maybe', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'place', 'list', 'many', 'movie', 'fans', 'will', 'linger', 'much', 'ponder', 'retrospect', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'winter', 'release', 'where', 'could', 'reaped', 'oh', 'eight', 'ten', 'nominations', 'What', 'have', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'was', 'outstanding', 'film']",N/A

Saul ""opinionated, yet  truthful, mu...","[0, 0]","I really ejoyed this movie yet it has it's problems.The problems emenate from two things;1) The characters are emotionless and practically cardboard and2) many apsects of this seem very implausible.Nevertheless, this is not supposed to be based on reality, it's just a movie and it does entertain brilliantly.Tom Hanks is Mike Sullivan, a sort of honorable hitman working for his adoptive father and crime boss Mr. Rooney, played by Paul Newman. Rooney has a biological son, played by Daniel Craig, who is a complete failure. In a [presumed] bit of jealousy (the movie never really explains this) Craig goes to wipe out Hank's wife and child not knowing that Hanks and his other son got away. In response to this, Hanks, along with his surviving son, goes on a revenge rampage against the whole gang. This is all set in early 1930's depression America.There are problems with some narrative, Craig's actions are not adequately explained, Hanks really does not bereave when he loses his family and people find each other, in a vast 1930's U.S.A., way too easily.I give an easy pass to the aforementioned flaws since this movie is based upon a graphic novel so, obviously, the visual takes presedence over other aspects and the visual is quite impressive.Hanks, believe it or not, is a credible hitman and is often filmed as a shawdowy figure in a trenchcoat and face hiding fedora. As in any comic book, he has few things to say. It is imputed through the film that he is a widely regarded and feared hitman. Paul Newman is portrayed as a physically frail yet mentally strong mob boss. Consistent with comic book monologues, his lines are prophetic. In fact, everybody as brief lines consistent with a graphic novel. Teh dialgoue is just enough to carry the plot.The scenes of old cars careening through country roads or Chicago streets are highly artistic. Likewise, many of the city scenes are done in a art deco manner and are very cinematic.The best thing about this movie is it's visuals. Every scene is meaningful, every shadow has it's purpose, every sound advances the plot. There's not a wasted scene. Just like a comic book, every scene is punctuated and that is what makes this movie so great.The tone of the movie, the visuals, the characters are all over-the-top stylish and that is why I find this movie to be such an entertaining piece of art.When you realize the movie is based upon a graphic novel then you should give a free pass to the noticeable flaws.",4,A flawed yet excellent movie,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,2471,"['really', 'ejoyed', 'movie', 'yet', 'problems.The', 'problems', 'emenate', 'two', 'things', '1', 'characters', 'are', 'emotionless', 'practically', 'cardboard', 'and2', 'many', 'apsects', 'seem', 'very', 'implausible.Nevertheless', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'reality', 'just', 'movie', 'entertain', 'brilliantly.Tom', 'Hanks', 'Mike', 'Sullivan', 'sort', 'honorable', 'hitman', 'working', 'adoptive', 'father', 'crime', 'Mr.', 'Rooney', 'played', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Rooney', 'biological', 'son', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'complete', 'failure', '[', 'presumed', ']', 'bit', 'jealousy', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'Craig', 'wipe', 'out', 'Hank', 'wife', 'child', 'not', 'knowing', 'Hanks', 'other', 'son', 'got', 'away', 'response', 'Hanks', 'surviving', 'son', 'revenge', 'rampage', 'whole', 'gang', 'set', 'early', '1930', 'depression', 'America.There', 'are', 'problems', 'narrative', 'Craig', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'adequately', 'explained', 'Hanks', 'really', 'not', 'bereave', 'when', 'family', 'people', 'find', 'other', 'vast', '1930', 'U.S.A.', 'way', 'too', 'easily.I', 'give', 'easy', 'pass', 'aforementioned', 'flaws', 'movie', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'so', 'obviously', 'visual', 'presedence', 'other', 'aspects', 'visual', 'quite', 'impressive.Hanks', 'believe', 'not', 'credible', 'hitman', 'often', 'filmed', 'shawdowy', 'figure', 'trenchcoat', 'face', 'hiding', 'fedora', 'comic', 'book', 'few', 'things', 'say', 'imputed', 'film', 'widely', 'regarded', 'feared', 'hitman', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'portrayed', 'physically', 'frail', 'yet', 'mentally', 'strong', 'mob', 'boss', 'Consistent', 'comic', 'book', 'monologues', 'lines', 'are', 'prophetic', 'fact', 'everybody', 'brief', 'lines', 'consistent', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Teh', 'dialgoue', 'just', 'enough', 'carry', 'plot.The', 'scenes', 'old', 'cars', 'careening', 'country', 'roads', 'Chicago', 'streets', 'are', 'highly', 'artistic', 'Likewise', 'many', 'city', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'art', 'deco', 'manner', 'are', 'very', 'cinematic.The', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'visuals', 'scene', 'meaningful', 'shadow', 'purpose', 'sound', 'plot', 'not', 'wasted', 'scene', 'Just', 'comic', 'book', 'scene', 'punctuated', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'great.The', 'tone', 'movie', 'visuals', 'characters', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'stylish', 'why', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'such', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'art.When', 'realize', 'movie', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'then', 'should', 'give', 'free', 'pass', 'noticeable', 'flaws']",N/A
597989,A2I7ZAB04Q0DML,B00005JLBQ,Scott Kolecki,"[4, 5]","When you bring together such talent as Paul Newman, Tom Hanks and Jude Law, it is almost expected that the movie will be a masterpiece.  Tom Hanks alone, whose body of work includes such incredible performances as Philidelphia, Forrest Gump and Castaway, is an exceptional talent whose abilities are unmatched in Hollywood today.  He possesses the rare gift of truly suspending disbelief by completely immersing himself in the role he plays.In this film, Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a hit-man working under the thumb of John Rooney (Paul Newman), a powerful crime-lord operating in a rural Illinois town during the early 1930's.  When Sullivan and Conner Rooney (Daniel Craig) are sent on a &quot;hit&quot;, Sullivan's son Michael (Tyler Hoechlin) tags along, concealed in the rear of his father's car.  When he witnesses a murder, he is discovered by Connor and his father, and is sworn to secrecy.John Rooney is enraged at Conner, whose actions went against his father's intent, and he publicly humiliates him while embracing Sullivan as the son he never had, and so Conner exacts revenge out of jealousy, taking out a hit on Sullivan and his family, again acting against his father.Conner succeeds in killing Sullivan's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and youngest son, but misses both Sullivan and Michael junior.  Upon the discovery of his wife and son's murder, Sullivan vows vengance for their deaths and sets out to find Connor and John Rooney, who have now gone into hiding under the protection of a powerful crime lord in Chicago.  When Rooney learns of Sullivan's intent, he unwillingly contracts a hit-man (Jude Law) to eliminate Sullivan.From this synopsis, one might deduce that this is simply another mob movie, in league with such films as Good Fellas or perhaps even the Godfather.  But what makes this a great film isn't its similarities to the other forementioned classics, but its bold stance to humanize the face of a mobster.  Hank's character is likeable, exhibiting a humanity and a vulnerability not normally portrayed in the hit-man stereotype.  He isn't simply a goon in a fedora and black trench, but a father and husband, whose resolve is shattered when he loses the people closest to him.  His relationship with his son is a pivotal part of the plot, as he must balance his hunger for revenge with the need to protect his boy.Paul Newman also brings a level of depth to the movie which makes him a complicated and difficult character, someone audiences will both pity and hate, and he is played with a level of intelligence and believability that makes him a delight to watch.The ending is a little disappointing, and, though I won't spoil it, I will say that it left this reviewer a little let down.  As Hollywood directors have become infamous for doing, there is a suprise ending that, though plausable, adds little to the story, save for the fact that it brings closure to the story's precept that the narrator states in the beginning of the film.Still, this film deserves the highest rating that I gave it.  It is a first class collection of performances built on a very engaging storyline of power and corruption in 1930's mob manipulated America.Scott Kolecki",5,&quot;Perdition&quot; Is A Road Worth Taking,1070928000,"12 9, 2003",2003,3194,"['When', 'bring', 'together', 'such', 'talent', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Jude', 'Law', 'almost', 'expected', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'alone', 'body', 'work', 'such', 'incredible', 'performances', 'Philidelphia', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Castaway', 'exceptional', 'talent', 'abilities', 'are', 'unmatched', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'rare', 'gift', 'truly', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'completely', 'immersing', 'role', 'film', 'Hanks', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'hit-man', 'working', 'thumb', 'John', 'Rooney', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'powerful', 'crime-lord', 'operating', 'rural', 'Illinois', 'town', 'early', '1930', 'When', 'Sullivan', 'Conner', 'Rooney', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'are', 'sent', 'quot', 'hit', 'quot', 'Sullivan', 'son', 'Michael', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'along', 'concealed', 'rear', 'father', 'car', 'When', 'murder', 'discovered', 'Connor', 'father', 'sworn', 'secrecy.John', 'Rooney', 'enraged', 'Conner', 'actions', 'went', 'father', 'intent', 'publicly', 'embracing', 'Sullivan', 'son', 'never', 'had', 'so', 'Conner', 'exacts', 'revenge', 'jealousy', 'taking', 'out', 'hit', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'again', 'acting', 'father.Conner', 'killing', 'Sullivan', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'youngest', 'son', 'Sullivan', 'Michael', 'junior', 'discovery', 'wife', 'son', 'murder', 'Sullivan', 'vengance', 'deaths', 'sets', 'out', 'find', 'Connor', 'John', 'Rooney', 'who', 'have', 'now', 'gone', 'hiding', 'protection', 'powerful', 'crime', 'lord', 'Chicago', 'When', 'Rooney', 'Sullivan', 'intent', 'unwillingly', 'contracts', 'hit-man', 'Jude', 'Law', 'eliminate', 'Sullivan.From', 'synopsis', 'one', 'might', 'deduce', 'simply', 'mob', 'movie', 'league', 'such', 'films', 'Good', 'Fellas', 'perhaps', 'even', 'Godfather', 'what', 'great', 'film', ""n't"", 'similarities', 'other', 'forementioned', 'classics', 'bold', 'stance', 'humanize', 'face', 'mobster', 'Hank', 'character', 'likeable', 'exhibiting', 'humanity', 'vulnerability', 'not', 'normally', 'portrayed', 'hit-man', 'stereotype', ""n't"", 'simply', 'goon', 'fedora', 'black', 'trench', 'father', 'husband', 'resolve', 'shattered', 'when', 'people', 'closest', 'relationship', 'son', 'pivotal', 'part', 'plot', 'must', 'balance', 'hunger', 'revenge', 'need', 'protect', 'boy.Paul', 'Newman', 'also', 'level', 'depth', 'movie', 'complicated', 'difficult', 'character', 'someone', 'audiences', 'will', 'pity', 'hate', 'played', 'level', 'intelligence', 'believability', 'delight', 'watch.The', 'ending', 'little', 'disappointing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'will', 'say', 'left', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'Hollywood', 'directors', 'have', 'become', 'infamous', 'doing', 'suprise', 'ending', 'plausable', 'little', 'story', 'save', 'fact', 'closure', 'story', 'precept', 'narrator', 'beginning', 'film.Still', 'film', 'highest', 'rating', 'gave', 'first', 'class', 'collection', 'performances', 'built', 'very', 'engaging', 'storyline', 'power', 'corruption', '1930', 'mob', 'manipulated', 'America.Scott', 'Kolecki']",N/A

Much of the film is set in the winter and you can feel the chill in the air, the weather is a ominious presence.

Wow, was I in for a nice surpise!The movie is set in the days of Al Capone, but in a small town outside of chicago where the gambling and booze is controlled by Paul Newman, aided by his son, the heir apparent, and his adopted son, Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks is an enforcer, Newman's strong arm, who tries to lead a normal home life with a wife and two sons. When his sons ask him what he does for a living, the mother, Jennifer Jason Leigh, says ""putting food on your plate, young man!"" There is a definite taboo on anyone talking about anything illegal or even admitting that they are outside the law.Do we believe nice guy Hanks as an Irish mobster? I did. A prosthetic nose helps change his looks just enough. Hanks proves once again he can be versatile as an actor and isn't just the nice romantic every-man.The movie begins at a wake which quickly establishes all of the relationships, including a Cain and Abel theme as Paul Newman's son looks on at the obvious rapport between Newman and Hanks with envy and jealousy.The story really begins when Tom Hanks' eldest son decides to hide himself in the car and see what his father does for a living, and so witnesses a murder by Paul Newman's son, who doesn't believe he can keep a secret and tragically, kills his mother and brother. Hanks and his son go on the run and eventually become a huge thorn in the side of Capone's business interests as Hanks exacts his revenge.All of the performances are stupendous, especially Newman who chooses his flesh and blood son over the adopted son he really loves, and Jude Law as a really sick hit man who specializes in taking pictures of dead people. Also amazing is the cinematography, which has the feel of a black and white film even though it's in color. Many of the shots could be framed as art, and they are actually art because this movie is based on a graphic novel.The director sets the mood and tone from the outset with his camera work and the excellent score by Thomas Newman. Others have complained that the movie is slow, but I didn't think so, to me it was more elegant than slow. I appreciated every single scene and wouldn't have liked to see any of them cut. It especially made the violence stand out - the moments of violence and action seem to come out of nowhere, and are all the more shocking and realistic because of that.Really, this is a story of a father and a son that just happens to be in the context of a gangster movie, and that's what makes this movie really special. These aren't cardboard cutouts weilding tommy guns, these are flesh-and-blood people trying to give their sons a better life then they had. People who have broken every commandment, believe they are going to hell, but draw the line at betraying their sons. To protect their children they will do anything, and that is always admirable, even when the father is an enforcer for the mob.I'm very surprised it wasn't nominated for best movie, it's much more solid and attains what it sets out to do, unlike ""Gangs of New York."" It has everything you could want in a movie - real emotions of many variations and dynamics, great character acting, awesome visuals and a fanastic score. It also translates well to the small screen and the DVD has a nice audio commentary by the director, who points out why he chose to film certain things the way he did to layer meaning into the story visually. It may not be the kind of movie you'll want to watch over and over, but it's definitely worth a first look.",5,Storytelling at its finest!,1047772800,"03 16, 2003",2003,3647,"['really', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'only', 'knew', 'loved', 'American', 'Beauty', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'had', 'done', 'next', 'Wow', 'was', 'nice', 'surpise', 'movie', 'set', 'days', 'Al', 'Capone', 'small', 'town', 'chicago', 'where', 'gambling', 'booze', 'controlled', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'aided', 'son', 'heir', 'apparent', 'adopted', 'son', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'enforcer', 'Newman', 'strong', 'arm', 'who', 'lead', 'normal', 'home', 'life', 'wife', 'two', 'sons', 'When', 'sons', 'ask', 'what', 'living', 'mother', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'putting', 'food', 'plate', 'young', 'man', 'definite', 'taboo', 'anyone', 'talking', 'anything', 'illegal', 'even', 'admitting', 'are', 'law.Do', 'believe', 'nice', 'guy', 'Hanks', 'Irish', 'mobster', 'did', 'A', 'prosthetic', 'nose', 'change', 'looks', 'just', 'enough', 'Hanks', 'once', 'again', 'can', 'be', 'versatile', 'actor', ""n't"", 'just', 'nice', 'romantic', 'every-man.The', 'movie', 'wake', 'quickly', 'relationships', 'including', 'Cain', 'Abel', 'theme', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'son', 'obvious', 'rapport', 'Newman', 'Hanks', 'envy', 'jealousy.The', 'story', 'really', 'when', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'eldest', 'son', 'hide', 'car', 'see', 'what', 'father', 'living', 'so', 'murder', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'son', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'can', 'keep', 'secret', 'tragically', 'mother', 'brother', 'Hanks', 'son', 'go', 'run', 'eventually', 'become', 'huge', 'thorn', 'side', 'Capone', 'business', 'interests', 'Hanks', 'revenge.All', 'performances', 'are', 'stupendous', 'especially', 'Newman', 'who', 'flesh', 'blood', 'son', 'adopted', 'son', 'really', 'Jude', 'Law', 'really', 'sick', 'hit', 'man', 'who', 'taking', 'pictures', 'dead', 'people', 'Also', 'amazing', 'cinematography', 'feel', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'even', 'color', 'Many', 'shots', 'could', 'be', 'framed', 'art', 'are', 'actually', 'art', 'movie', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel.The', 'director', 'mood', 'tone', 'outset', 'camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'score', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'Others', 'have', 'complained', 'movie', 'slow', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'was', 'more', 'elegant', 'slow', 'appreciated', 'single', 'scene', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'cut', 'especially', 'made', 'violence', 'stand', 'moments', 'violence', 'action', 'seem', 'come', 'nowhere', 'are', 'more', 'shocking', 'realistic', 'that.Really', 'story', 'father', 'son', 'just', 'be', 'context', 'gangster', 'movie', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'special', 'are', ""n't"", 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'weilding', 'tommy', 'guns', 'are', 'flesh-and-blood', 'people', 'trying', 'give', 'sons', 'better', 'life', 'then', 'had', 'People', 'who', 'have', 'broken', 'commandment', 'believe', 'are', 'going', 'hell', 'line', 'betraying', 'sons', 'protect', 'children', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'always', 'admirable', 'even', 'when', 'father', 'enforcer', 'mob.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'best', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'solid', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'movie', 'real', 'emotions', 'many', 'variations', 'dynamics', 'great', 'character', 'acting', 'awesome', 'visuals', 'fanastic', 'score', 'also', 'well', 'small', 'screen', 'DVD', 'nice', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'who', 'out', 'why', 'chose', 'film', 'certain', 'things', 'way', 'did', 'layer', 'meaning', 'story', 'visually', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'kind', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'definitely', 'worth', 'first', 'look']",N/A

Tom Hanks has been better many times, and is quite frankly miscast as a big old tough guy.  Jennifer Jason Leigh, well, she's my favorite actress (Unite ladies!), but it's unusual that she doesn't have a few more scenes.  I keep forgetting my favorite actress is in this movie.Jude Law and Paul Newman literally walk away with this movie.  I'm not sure why Jude wasn't nominated alongside Newman, after all he was nominated for Mr. Ripley a few years ago.  But Newman dominates this movie with his gruff old-timer persona.  What a legend, and a real rare gentleman from what I'm told.This is an Oscar winning film, as the stunning cinematography was recognized.  And rightly so, because this is a beaut.  For weird reasons, the sound was nominated which is kind of silly because the movie is so quiet I found myself lulled to sleep in some of the boring spots (trust me, there are a few).I hate special features on dvds, so I was glad to see that there are not many included on this release.  They are just a waste of time and I never view them.  Why would I want to hear somebody talk while I watch the movie?  Commentary tracks are annoying, and that's not just my opinion.  I put this one on for about 3 minutes, just to hear how pretentious Sam Mendes British accent is.  And it certainly is.  If you really want to watch this movie in style, get some Newman's Own snacks like his awesome Orange chocolate chip cookies, which I understand he personally supervises.This movie is not ever going to be looked at as a classic of the gangster genre, and the violence is unfortunately subdued.  Ever since Goodfellas gave us such in-your-face bloodiness, it has become a contest to see who can really top the gore quotient.  Well, this one falls far short and will likely leave hard-core gangster film fans very dissapointed.

It's not a bad film exactly, but its ponderously sad tone wears thin after the first half hour, which spends most of its time setting up what amounts to a predictable chase around the countryside.  Weird-looking but surprisingly popular lead Tom Hanks plays what has become a contemporary archetype: hit man with a heart.  The twist here is that after his son witnesses a shootout in which Sullivan (Hanks), along with the spineless lump (Daniel Craig) who is the boss's (a grumbling Paul Newman) son, gun down a set-up lackey and his gang, it's the Sullivans who become targets.  Like Mendes' other blockbuster, ""American Beauty,"" the clich&eacute;s come hard and fast, as do the Irish and Italian stereotypes, and the plot goes exactly where one expects it to, with lines equally forecasted (showing its graphic novel roots).  The beachside showdown at the end with a determined hit man (Jude Law) who spends more time in his hotel room than on the job - and who wears a funny hat - seems more merciful than poignant, in that it puts a capper onto a film that probably went on half an hour longer than it should have.  Ultimately, ""The Road to Perdition"" may best be remembered as the film that showed us a pre-James Bond Craig, whose performance here suggests he may have the chops to pull the character off, if not the looks, as he just seems too wan and blonde for the ruggedly handsome 007.",3,More Ponderous Than Poignant Claptrap,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,1517,"['Sam', 'Mendes', 'turgid', 'adapation', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'much', 'what', 'modern', 'American', 'cinema', 'so', 'one', 'note', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'exactly', 'ponderously', 'sad', 'tone', 'wears', 'thin', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'most', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'what', 'amounts', 'predictable', 'chase', 'countryside', 'Weird-looking', 'surprisingly', 'popular', 'lead', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'become', 'contemporary', 'archetype', 'hit', 'man', 'heart', 'twist', 'here', 'son', 'shootout', 'Sullivan', 'Hanks', 'spineless', 'lump', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'boss', 'grumbling', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'son', 'gun', 'down', 'set-up', 'lackey', 'gang', 'Sullivans', 'who', 'become', 'targets', 'Mendes', 'other', 'blockbuster', 'American', 'Beauty', 'clich', 'eacute', 'come', 'hard', 'fast', 'do', 'Irish', 'Italian', 'stereotypes', 'plot', 'exactly', 'where', 'one', 'lines', 'equally', 'forecasted', 'showing', 'graphic', 'novel', 'roots', 'beachside', 'showdown', 'end', 'determined', 'hit', 'man', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'more', 'time', 'hotel', 'room', 'job', 'who', 'funny', 'hat', 'more', 'merciful', 'poignant', 'capper', 'film', 'probably', 'went', 'hour', 'longer', 'should', 'have', 'Ultimately', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'may', 'best', 'be', 'remembered', 'film', 'showed', 'pre-James', 'Bond', 'Craig', 'performance', 'here', 'may', 'have', 'chops', 'pull', 'character', 'not', 'looks', 'just', 'too', 'wan', 'blonde', 'ruggedly', 'handsome', '007']",N/A

While this is not a head to head comparison, I do own and have seen this film on Standard Def many times.VIDEO...This is a fine example of what the studios can achieve when reformatting a film to Blu Ray and this really is a great remaster.  While the Standard Def version was not bad, you will see a greatly improved color balance and a significantly sharper contrast in the Blu Ray release.  Color grading tends to be warm but desaturated as the producers originally set out to do.  The biggest difference between formats is that there is so much more to the details in the Blu Ray version.  The rain drops are not a sheer blur as in most Standard DVDs, you can almost see each individual drop and there are plenty of them throughout the film.  Wonderful details in the many dark and shadowy scenes.  At no point did I see any artifacting, noise reduction halos or aliasing throughout the film.  Mbps rate tended to average in the mid thirties so this disc really has a relatively higher bit rate than most.  A great transfer.AUDIO....DTS HD MA 5.1 is the lossless audio supplied for this Blu Ray and lossless audio is always better than lossy as there is less compression of the sound stage.  There is a good deal of discreet directionality to the sides and rears when appropriate though it contains quite a bit more audio for the front stage and center than anything else.  It seemed to me that the audio levels were a touch lower than most blu rays and so I upped the volume just a bit.  All audio levels are properly set relative to each other so I had no need to play roller coaster with the volume knob once I had set it properly.  All dialogue was nicely transparent and easy to understand and did not have to fight against the musical score which was spread well across the front stage producing a nice stereo spread.  The LFE channel does come into play at times, and those times really make it jump but, for the most part, the sub doesn't have a whole lot of reproduction to do.EXTRAS...Haven't watched them all but there are some really interesting extras aside from the typical commentary including an introduction for this new release by the director.  The many deleted scenes were all finished scenes which I would have liked to have had included on an extended version.  The extra I most enjoyed was an exploration in a historical sense of the life and times of many of the gangsters portrayed in the film as well as other aspects of the time.All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of the transfer of a film to blu ray and I do hope that I have been of help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions.Thanks for reading",5,Road to Perdition on Blu Ray,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,2873,"['great', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'supplied', 'plenty', 'movie', 'summaries', 'thoughts', 'storyline', 'opinions', 'acting', 'cast', 'will', 'only', 'focus', 'quality', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Standard', 'Definition', 'version', 'not', 'head', 'head', 'comparison', 'do', 'own', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'Standard', 'Def', 'many', 'times.VIDEO', 'fine', 'example', 'what', 'studios', 'can', 'achieve', 'when', 'reformatting', 'film', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'really', 'great', 'remaster', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'will', 'see', 'greatly', 'improved', 'color', 'balance', 'significantly', 'sharper', 'contrast', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release', 'Color', 'grading', 'tends', 'be', 'warm', 'desaturated', 'producers', 'originally', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'biggest', 'difference', 'formats', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'details', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'rain', 'drops', 'are', 'not', 'sheer', 'blur', 'most', 'Standard', 'DVDs', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'individual', 'drop', 'are', 'plenty', 'film', 'Wonderful', 'details', 'many', 'dark', 'shadowy', 'scenes', 'point', 'did', 'see', 'artifacting', 'noise', 'reduction', 'halos', 'aliasing', 'film', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'tended', 'average', 'mid', 'thirties', 'disc', 'really', 'relatively', 'higher', 'bit', 'rate', 'most', 'great', 'transfer.AUDIO', '.DTS', 'HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'lossless', 'audio', 'supplied', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'lossless', 'audio', 'always', 'better', 'lossy', 'less', 'compression', 'sound', 'stage', 'good', 'deal', 'discreet', 'directionality', 'sides', 'rears', 'when', 'appropriate', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'audio', 'front', 'stage', 'center', 'anything', 'else', 'seemed', 'audio', 'levels', 'were', 'touch', 'lower', 'most', 'blu', 'rays', 'so', 'upped', 'volume', 'just', 'bit', 'audio', 'levels', 'are', 'properly', 'set', 'relative', 'other', 'so', 'had', 'need', 'play', 'roller', 'coaster', 'volume', 'knob', 'once', 'had', 'set', 'properly', 'dialogue', 'was', 'nicely', 'transparent', 'easy', 'understand', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'fight', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'spread', 'well', 'front', 'stage', 'producing', 'nice', 'stereo', 'spread', 'LFE', 'channel', 'come', 'play', 'times', 'times', 'really', 'make', 'jump', 'most', 'part', 'sub', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'reproduction', 'do.EXTRAS', 'Have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'are', 'really', 'interesting', 'extras', 'aside', 'typical', 'commentary', 'including', 'introduction', 'new', 'release', 'director', 'many', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'finished', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'had', 'included', 'extended', 'version', 'extra', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'exploration', 'historical', 'sense', 'life', 'times', 'many', 'gangsters', 'portrayed', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'aspects', 'time.All', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'transfer', 'film', 'blu', 'ray', 'do', 'hope', 'have', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'decisions.Thanks', 'reading']",N/A

Take your pick, this is one slow flick.It's 1931 and Tom Hanks plays Chicago hit-man Mike Sullivan, The Angel of Death, and surrogate son to mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman.)  When Sullivan's son Mike Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) observes his father and Rooney's son Connor (Daniel Craig) bump off a clutch of gangsters everything changes.  Connor, motivated by a mixture of sibling jealousy and a need to keep the killings a secret, decides to wipe out the Sullivan family.  He succeeds in murdering Sullivan's wife and youngest son, but misses Mike and Mike Jr.  The surviving Sullivans escape and embark on a journey of revenge and survival.THE ROAD TO PERDITION was taken from an illustrated novel, and I understand the filmmakers responsibility to the source material, but I would have dropped the kid and abandoned the notion of telling the story of the son's point of view.  At this point in Hanks' career it's difficult enough to accept him as a physically imposing, inarticulate brute.  Viewing him through the eyes of his emotionally distant son doesn't help.  Hanks is an incredible actor, but he's also a movie star cast against type in this one.  The story doesn't allow him the opportunity to convince us of his character.It looks great.  Cinematographer Conrad Hall is a genius, especially when it comes to filming rain.  The sets are gorgeous, the feeling of depression-era America is well captured.  Unfortunately the movie takes forever to sprout wings, and even then it doesn't fly.  The wonderful Jennifer Jason Leigh is barely seen and largely wasted as Sullivan's wife.  There's are whole scenes that go nowhere in particular (the wake scene, for instance) and seem intended to do nothing more than establish atmosphere.I could go on, but I'll simply say that considering the talent involved this was a big disappointment.",2,Road to Perdition,1085184000,"05 22, 2004",2004,1926,"['Wow', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'PERDITION', 'slow', 'moving', 'movie', 'Deliberate', 'ponderous', 'lugubrious', 'Take', 'pick', 'one', 'slow', 'flick.It', '1931', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Chicago', 'hit-man', 'Mike', 'Sullivan', 'Angel', 'Death', 'surrogate', 'son', 'mob', 'boss', 'John', 'Rooney', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'When', 'Sullivan', 'son', 'Mike', 'Jr.', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'father', 'Rooney', 'son', 'Connor', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'bump', 'off', 'clutch', 'gangsters', 'everything', 'changes', 'Connor', 'motivated', 'mixture', 'sibling', 'jealousy', 'need', 'keep', 'killings', 'secret', 'wipe', 'out', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'murdering', 'Sullivan', 'wife', 'youngest', 'son', 'Mike', 'Mike', 'Jr', 'surviving', 'Sullivans', 'escape', 'embark', 'journey', 'revenge', 'survival.THE', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'PERDITION', 'was', 'taken', 'illustrated', 'novel', 'understand', 'filmmakers', 'responsibility', 'source', 'material', 'would', 'have', 'dropped', 'kid', 'abandoned', 'notion', 'telling', 'story', 'son', 'point', 'view', 'point', 'Hanks', 'career', 'difficult', 'enough', 'accept', 'physically', 'imposing', 'inarticulate', 'brute', 'Viewing', 'eyes', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'son', ""n't"", 'help', 'Hanks', 'incredible', 'actor', 'also', 'movie', 'star', 'cast', 'type', 'one', 'story', ""n't"", 'allow', 'opportunity', 'convince', 'character.It', 'great', 'Cinematographer', 'Conrad', 'Hall', 'genius', 'especially', 'when', 'filming', 'rain', 'sets', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'feeling', 'depression-era', 'America', 'well', 'captured', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'forever', 'sprout', 'wings', 'even', 'then', ""n't"", 'fly', 'wonderful', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'barely', 'seen', 'largely', 'wasted', 'Sullivan', 'wife', 'are', 'whole', 'scenes', 'go', 'nowhere', 'particular', 'wake', 'scene', 'instance', 'seem', 'intended', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'establish', 'atmosphere.I', 'could', 'go', ""'ll"", 'simply', 'say', 'considering', 'talent', 'involved', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment']",N/A
598006,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00005JLBQ,Steven Reynolds,"[1, 2]","This is a wonderful looking film, and that's both the best thing and the worst thing about it. The ethereal charm of the visuals plays against the inherent terror of the story - and without that terror feeling real, the tension just drains away. I found it utterly impossible to suspend my disbelief when it's a story about gangsters, but it looks like ""Miracle On 34th Street"". Of course, it's not just 'a story about gangsters' - it's a story about paternal love, sibling rivalry, generational change, final acts of redemption and, of course, the path to destruction. These are big themes, big issues - and they're consistently over emphasized. The visuals, writing, direction and music are so prescriptive, so emphatic (""FEEL THIS NOW!!!""), that we're never allowed to fall into the story and work anything out for ourselves. In short, it's too self-conscious - too distractingly aware of its own striving for greatness - to ever actually get there. Paul Newman stands out amongst the cast, giving his best performance in years. But the others are less impressive. Superficially, this is Tom Hanks extending his range by playing a bad guy - but he isn't that bad and you don't for an instant forget who's playing him. (Harrison Ford's villainous turn in ""What Lies Beneath"" was much more convincing - and Harry's no actor.) You can almost see Hanks preparing his third Oscar acceptance speech in every anguished close-up, every stoic grimace. But the only man who should be prepping for a third is Conrad Hall - his cinematography is magnificent, even if misapplied to this material. But such is the peril in adapting graphic novels. It's usually the visual rendering of a story which has caught the director's eye, and everything else in the production gets subjugated to recreating that.

598007,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,B00005JLBQ,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[1, 3]","Sam Mendes' ""Road to Perdition"" is a tale illustrating how the fickle hand of fate can unleash terrible tragedy and destruction. It is also a film undermined by its simplicity of story. The story revolves around Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), a hit man for the Chicago mob in the 1930's. While out one night on an assignment, Sullivan's son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) accidentally discovers what his father does for a living by witnessing one of his executions. Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) tries to clean up the mess caused by Michael Jr.'s discovery and this sets into motion a bloody conflict between Sullivan and his former employer, John Rooney (Paul Newman).Despite its noteworthy cast and the presence of director Sam Mendes (""American Beauty""), ""Road to Perdition"" plays out like a routine point A to point B story. It is a film that plays it safe and simple. There are no exciting twists on its dramatic themes and its straightforward plot actually leads to a number of lulls in its narrative. Yet the film is not devoid of merits. Conrad L. Hall's terrific cinematography ensures that the audience is always looking at a pretty picture and the cast is outstanding. Hanks shows that he can effectively stretch his screen persona and Hoechlin firmly establishes himself as a valued member of the current generation of child actors. Additionally, it is always a treat to see Newman perform and he brings a quiet but powerful dignity to all of his scenes. Jude Law also turns in quality work as a demented assassin.Still, ""Road to Perdition"" only comes across as adequate. It is a production that holds your attention but quickly fades from memory once it concludes. The character dynamics just are not as rich as those in ""The Godfather"" and the film produces surprisingly little energy.

Tom Hanks is Michael Sullivan, stone killer and first assistant to mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman).  Twelve-year old son, Michael Jr. sneaks a ride with Dad and Conner Rooney (Daniel Craig), worthless son of the boss, to see what exactly it is that Dad does for a living.  Young Michael gets a knee-high view of a talk that went wrong that turned into a hit by the impulsive and reprehensible Connor.  Mike, Sr. did the clean up with a tommy gun.  When Mike, Jr. is discovered, the dilemma is set in motion.  Fearing that the boy will be unable to keep a secret, Connor, with astounding ineptness, kills the younger son and mother, mistaking him for Mike Jr.  Father and son abandon everything and hit the road for six weeks, partly in flight, partly to plot and carry out revenge.It is worth the price of the ticket just to see Newman and Hanks interacting.  Newman has the dramatic role of anguished love for his adopted aide, a lilting Irish charm, and a deadly coldness.  Hanks is subdued, probably not overly bright, taciturn and determined.  As usual, his eyes tell the story.  Jude Law in the scene-stealing role of assassin McGuire is a marvel of slithery, oddly graceful pop-eyed menace.  You tend to forget about him for a while, but then he pops up unexpectedly and startles you anew.  Stanley Tucci is a splendid suave, civilized Frank Nitti.  Poor Jennifer Jason Leigh as the wife and mother had not more than five lines of dialogue, which was rather a waste.The mood and the settings were dark.  It rained and sleeted and snowed; everything and everybody looked miserable in the cityscapes.  I would guess the original locale was supposed to be Rock Island, IL, a very corrupt fiefdom of the Chicago mob during prohibition.  I was continually reminded of artist Edward Hopper and his painting Nighthawks.  Road to Perdition imbues the viewer with the same loneliness, separation and disassociation of the big unfeeling city.  The ballet-like scene of Rooney's assassination in the rain, umbrellas like graceful markers-all without sound --- is unforgettable.All was not perfect.  The static voice-over introducing and ending the film weakened it.  The harsh solution to the boy's keeping a secret seemed unreal to me.  A major point in the movie was redemption for the boy, where the father was doomed for the life he had led.  Then why did the father make the boy his accomplice; further physically and morally endangering him?  Well, there would not have been a story if Hanks had found a monastery to hide the boy, now would there?  Overall, Road to Perdition is an amazing experience of mood, originality and visual artistry",4,Requiem for a Killer,1027296000,"07 22, 2002",2002,2747,"['Stately', 'elegiac', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'tale', 'redemption', 'revenge', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'stone', 'killer', 'first', 'assistant', 'mob', 'boss', 'John', 'Rooney', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Twelve-year', 'old', 'son', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'ride', 'Dad', 'Conner', 'Rooney', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'worthless', 'son', 'boss', 'see', 'what', 'exactly', 'Dad', 'living', 'Young', 'Michael', 'knee-high', 'view', 'talk', 'went', 'turned', 'hit', 'impulsive', 'reprehensible', 'Connor', 'Mike', 'Sr.', 'did', 'clean', 'up', 'tommy', 'gun', 'When', 'Mike', 'Jr.', 'discovered', 'dilemma', 'set', 'motion', 'Fearing', 'boy', 'will', 'be', 'unable', 'keep', 'secret', 'Connor', 'astounding', 'ineptness', 'younger', 'son', 'mother', 'mistaking', 'Mike', 'Jr.', 'Father', 'son', 'abandon', 'everything', 'hit', 'road', 'six', 'weeks', 'partly', 'flight', 'partly', 'plot', 'carry', 'out', 'revenge.It', 'price', 'ticket', 'just', 'see', 'Newman', 'Hanks', 'interacting', 'Newman', 'dramatic', 'role', 'anguished', 'love', 'adopted', 'aide', 'lilting', 'Irish', 'charm', 'deadly', 'coldness', 'Hanks', 'subdued', 'probably', 'not', 'overly', 'bright', 'taciturn', 'determined', 'usual', 'eyes', 'tell', 'story', 'Jude', 'Law', 'scene-stealing', 'role', 'assassin', 'McGuire', 'marvel', 'slithery', 'oddly', 'graceful', 'pop-eyed', 'menace', 'tend', 'forget', 'while', 'then', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'startles', 'anew', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'splendid', 'suave', 'civilized', 'Frank', 'Nitti', 'Poor', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'wife', 'mother', 'had', 'not', 'more', 'five', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'was', 'rather', 'waste.The', 'mood', 'settings', 'were', 'dark', 'rained', 'sleeted', 'snowed', 'everything', 'everybody', 'looked', 'miserable', 'cityscapes', 'would', 'guess', 'original', 'locale', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Rock', 'Island', 'IL', 'very', 'corrupt', 'fiefdom', 'Chicago', 'mob', 'prohibition', 'was', 'continually', 'reminded', 'artist', 'Edward', 'Hopper', 'painting', 'Nighthawks', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'viewer', 'same', 'loneliness', 'separation', 'disassociation', 'big', 'unfeeling', 'city', 'ballet-like', 'scene', 'Rooney', 'assassination', 'rain', 'umbrellas', 'graceful', 'markers-all', 'sound', 'unforgettable.All', 'was', 'not', 'perfect', 'static', 'voice-over', 'introducing', 'ending', 'film', 'weakened', 'harsh', 'solution', 'boy', 'keeping', 'secret', 'seemed', 'unreal', 'major', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'redemption', 'boy', 'where', 'father', 'was', 'doomed', 'life', 'had', 'led', 'Then', 'why', 'did', 'father', 'make', 'boy', 'accomplice', 'physically', 'morally', 'endangering', 'Well', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'story', 'Hanks', 'had', 'found', 'monastery', 'hide', 'boy', 'now', 'would', 'there', 'Overall', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'amazing', 'experience', 'mood', 'originality', 'visual', 'artistry']",N/A

If you have been lucky enough to witness this beautiful, breathtaking and intoxicating journey then you know what I am talking about. ""Road to Perdition"" may be the vehicle that gets Tom Hanks (in my opinion the best damned American actor of the past 15 years) out of his 'nice guy' role, but it should most definitely rope him an Oscar for Best Actor. I know that its early, but it will surely be hard to beat this performance.I read that Hanks had wished director Sam Mendes had offered him the part of Lester Burnham in ""American Beauty."" That role went to Kevin Spacey, who became the embodiment of that character, much the same way that Hanks defines mob hitman Mike Sullivan in this film.The film, as you most certainly already know, details the story of Sullivan and his son attempting to seek revenge for the murders of Sullivan's wife and youngest son. The kicker is that the mob boss that Sullivan works for, played by Paul Newman, is fatefully intertwined with the whole mess, as it was Newman's son Connor who kills Sullivan's wife and child. And then the whole ""you killed my wife and kid, now I kill you"" routine kicks in. But the ironic part is....there is nothing routine about this film.There are moments that will stay with you long after the film has passed. For instance, Hanks and Newman playing a duet together on a piano, the insane look in Hanks' eyes when he says a prayer in a church, and the gut-wrenching and horribly tragic finale. Even the melancholy and maddingly sorrowful film score will stick deep inside of you, as composer Thomas Newman did an absolutely wonderful job of capturing the essence of the story in his music.I can't tell you to go and see this film. I would like it if you took the time to see it because you actually wanted to. I was not disappointed in Sam Mendes' gorgeous revenge/ganster timepiece that almost borders on film noir territory. The moral dilemmas of Mike & his son are quite evident, and the killing in the film all has a feeling of necessity to it, there are no scenes of gratuitous killing, every death has a purpose.All in all, this has to rank with ""Gladiator"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" as one of the best films to be produced in the last 5 years. Heartwarming, gut-wrenching, bloody, violent, emotional and unforgettable are all words you could use to describe this masterpiece. I myself can not find a word to describe how this film affected me and how well it was produced. I simply say this, if this film does not win Oscars for Best Actor (Hanks), Best Director (Mendes)and Best Film, I will never watch the Oscars again.

When Sullivan's oldest son [Tyler Hoechlin] witnesses an unplanned murder on one of Sullivan's mob hits, Sullivan is determined to have his son keep it to himself.However Hanks character's world is turned upside down as he is betrayed by his mob family and his wife and youngest son are killed in fear that the kid will tell the police of the mob hit. Sullivan takes his remaining son and goes on the run, always looking over his shoulder and swearing revenge on the man who killed his family [Who also was Rooney's son in the first place.]Paul Newman portrays John Rooney, the mob boss himself, a man who is nearing the end of his time, but is still intimidating and powerful none the less. He himself has great respect for Sullivan, and even cares for him like a father would for a son [Ironic, isn't it?]The main plotline is both Sullivan and his son on the run, looking for a new safe place to live. There are other littler plot lines that keep the movie entertaining:From Sullivan teaching his son to drive the car so he can rob banks to get money to keep them alive, to even Rooney hiring a hit man/photographer [Jude Law]to track down the two runaways and kill them. So many great actors, one movie that will assure you the acting will never get dull.Not to let too much info get out [in case you haven't seen the movie yet] I will say that the interaction between Newman and Hanks near the end in the church is absolute gold, where both men have their final respects and say what they think about each other.Jude Law gives a chilling performance as a photographer who takes pictures of the dead because he was always captivated by the way they looked like and how they lay still. His interaction with Hanks in the diner is chilling, telling Hanks what he thinks of his line of work as a photographer as he loads a camera [and also a gun under the bench.]The ending is surprsing [At least I thought so] and a powerful message from the son gives this movie a 5 star rating.The extras include commentary by the director, Sam Mendes, and also some of the actors.

His first main feature, &quot;American Beauty&quot; was an exhilerating tale that on one level was a satire of surban life, while also a dark, melancholic depection of the meaning of life and how beautiful each small essence of it can be.  &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;, his next feature, has a simlar tone to it and is a film that is layered similar to an onion.Tom Hanks is good (yes, only good--his efforts in films such as &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, &quot;Castaway&quot;, and &quot;The Green Mile&quot; were slightly better) as a gangster who works for one of the most powerful (and crooked) men in the city (played by Paul Newman in a limited role, unfortunately).  When his son (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses an accidental murder of one of his father's colleagues, the duo must leave town in order to survive the aftermath of the ordeal.  Jude Law gives a great performance as the eerie photographer who is hired to not only track down the father and son, but kill them because of the information they are not supposed to know.&quot;Road to Perdition&quot; is a powerful tale that captures the essence of the extraordinary possibilites presented in a father-son bond.  It is a film that shows the corruptness of the business world at the time (the film was depicted around the time of the depression), but ultimately unfolds as a journey about vengeance, redemption, and love.  Although not as superb as some critics may have claimed, it is still a motion picture that will satisfy fans of Hanks and Mendes, although those who are anticipating a powerhouse role from the aging Newman will be disappointed--he is not as integral part of the film as you would think.

By all accounts, he is a normal man, who is hiding one very dark secret, he is a hit-man for an organized crime syndicate. His secret is safe and life continues on as usual until one day, his son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), witnesses his father execute someone. Sullivan assures his bosses that everything is fine and his son won't say anything, but when has the mob ever taken that chance? Sullivan and his family are targeted for elimination and only he and his son manage to escape to Chicago, where he plans his revenge. As with most films based on a novel, the story here is top notch and very well written. Tom Hanks is the premier actor of our time, a man who will be remembered for centuries, but was he really the right choice to play Michael Sullivan? Hanks has many amazing skills as an actor, but playing such a cold, sedentary character, Hanks is unable to use his many tools and gives a performance that is very dry. The audience simply doesn't relate to Sullivan the way they relate to his son, and that brings the emotional impact of the film way below what it was intended to be. Tyler Hoechlin is fairly well known now, but when he got this role, it was his first, and he beat out over 10,000 other kids to get it. I don't know who any of those other kids were, but Hoechlin couldn't have had much competition, because he was out of this world good. It's a shame that the Academy rarely recognizes kids and that Paul Newman got the Best Supporting Actor nod over Hoechlin, because this kid is really the only one who comes off in a way that the writers originally intended. Road To Perdition was a tremendous story and was full of award winning actors, but the star power was more important to the producers, then finding actors who fit the characters as they were written. Aside from that and a painfully predictable ending, that you have to see coming, this was a pretty good film. I loved the setting and how dark it was, as well as the originality of a film that takes places nearly 60 years ago. I just find it ironic that in a cast full of Academy Award winning actors, it's a kid who steals the show.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,2467,"['When', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'hit', 'theaters', 'was', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'was', 'eventually', 'nominated', 'six', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'dark', 'deliver', 'emotional', 'impact', 'intended', 'have', 'audience', '1930s', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'family', 'man', 'living', 'suburban', 'mid-west', 'accounts', 'normal', 'man', 'who', 'hiding', 'one', 'very', 'dark', 'secret', 'hit-man', 'organized', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'secret', 'safe', 'life', 'usual', 'one', 'day', 'son', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'father', 'execute', 'someone', 'Sullivan', 'bosses', 'everything', 'fine', 'son', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'when', 'mob', 'ever', 'taken', 'chance', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'are', 'targeted', 'elimination', 'only', 'son', 'manage', 'escape', 'Chicago', 'where', 'revenge', 'most', 'films', 'based', 'novel', 'story', 'here', 'top', 'notch', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'premier', 'actor', 'time', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'centuries', 'was', 'really', 'right', 'choice', 'play', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Hanks', 'many', 'amazing', 'skills', 'actor', 'playing', 'such', 'cold', 'sedentary', 'character', 'Hanks', 'unable', 'use', 'many', 'tools', 'performance', 'very', 'dry', 'audience', 'simply', ""n't"", 'relate', 'Sullivan', 'way', 'relate', 'son', 'emotional', 'impact', 'film', 'way', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'Tyler', 'Hoechlin', 'fairly', 'well', 'known', 'now', 'when', 'got', 'role', 'was', 'first', 'beat', 'out', '10,000', 'other', 'kids', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'other', 'kids', 'were', 'Hoechlin', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'much', 'competition', 'was', 'out', 'world', 'good', 'shame', 'Academy', 'rarely', 'kids', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'got', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'nod', 'Hoechlin', 'kid', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'off', 'way', 'writers', 'originally', 'intended', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'was', 'tremendous', 'story', 'was', 'full', 'award', 'winning', 'actors', 'star', 'power', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'producers', 'then', 'finding', 'actors', 'who', 'fit', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'Aside', 'painfully', 'predictable', 'ending', 'have', 'see', 'coming', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'loved', 'setting', 'how', 'dark', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'originality', 'film', 'places', 'nearly', '60', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'find', 'ironic', 'cast', 'full', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'actors', 'kid', 'who', 'show']",N/A
598021,A31EZZ14E0IIME,B00005JLBQ,Tom Harrison,"[0, 0]","Road to Perdition is a very good drama, documenting a father and son's six-week rampage across America, being chased by an assassin.Tom Hanks is Mike Sullivan, hit man for an important businessman until his son witnesses him commit murder. Hanks is very well suited to this role, even if 'gangster' isn't a word you often associate him with in films. He is wonderfully heartless and unemotional, not flinching as he kills men in cold blood. Hanks manages to murder so many people on his own, even the Terminator would be jealous! It is a very good drama, combining your typical mafia movie with big-budget Hollywood quality, and coming out on top.Now, why is it the modern Godfather you ask? Characters and their attitudes. Hanks' son is a character similar to that of Michael Corleone in the Godfather, the child who didn't want a life of crime, but is forced into one. As with Michael, he finds that this life is his destiny and becomes on eof the best in the business. Hanks is brilliant in a role he deserved an Oscar nomination for, playing the Vito Corleone-like mentor teaching his son the ways of the mobster. He is convincing in this manner, showing that this life was the one he chose, but hadn't wanted for his children.Road to Perdition is a very good movie, as you would expect when Tom Hanks is involved. A solid storyline, strong casting, and the 5-star video & audio standards DVD's offer.

I liked the cinematography, the style in which in the movie was shot and the long-shots coupled with some real spiffy camera work.What I didn't like so much was the too-obvious (and, lets be honest, somewhat contrived) ending. Sullivan (Hanks) is your number one hitman who gets the job done. He's stared death in the face a number of times yet always manages to end up still alive. Then he's involved in a shoot out with a spotty and under-developed character played by Jude Law. Hanks inexplicably fails to finish his counterpart off only for *shock* Law to return at some later date to kill him.Would a character like Sullivans really walk into that beach house and not look behind him, especially as he expected to find his sister there and instead found no-one and nothing (not even furniture)?.

598023,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B00005JLBQ,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[4, 5]","Movie - 5.0I'd never seen the movie until a few years ago when a friend of mine let me borrow it on DVD. I had little expectations going in, other than the fact that Tom Hanks (of all people) was playing a hitman. I hadn't (and still haven't seen, at the time of this review) American Beauty and only knew who Sam Mendes was by name, and not reputation. Back then, I thought the movie was pretty good. I saw it mostly as a revenge-themed story, liked the bits of character development throughout, and enjoyed the overall aesthetic feel of post-Depression 1930s gangster-dom. Today, after having developed a better sense of awareness and taste for a film's writing, I am completely blown away by the level of depth in story and character on this subsequent viewing. Plot summary aside, I find Road to Perdition to be everything I remember and so much more. It's a coming-of-age story for sons, a resolution for fathers, a testament to the brutality of violence, and an emotional tale about the preservation of innocence all brilliantly disguised in the form of a revenge thriller. I was particularly engrossed by the parallel relationships shared between father and son through all forms: Sullivan and his son, Rooney and his son, then Rooney and Sullivan Sr. The similarities shared between the father-son pairings make for some very quaint and believable bonds, while still managing to make these characters empathetic. Without revealing too much, the story possesses a lot of thematic value and is a very moving drama that tells a masterful story through a lost setting that we just don't see much of anymore (that is, the 1930s gangster era). Tom Hanks is in top form as Sullivan Sr. with outstanding support performances by Daniel Craig, Stanley Tucci, Jude Law, Tyler Hoechlin, and the late Paul Newman. It's great that the film won an award for Cinematography and was nominated for some other technical categories, but nothing for Best Picture, Director, or Actor? Oh well, regardless of Oscar snubs, I'm happy to say this is definitely a new all-time favorite for me now.Video - 4.5As mentioned, Road to Perdition won an Academy Award for Cinematography, and with good reason. The picture looks gorgeously bleak. Colors are subdued, with a lot of grays, charcoals, and solid blacks being the focus. Primaries don't make much of an appearance apart from the happier moments outside in the sunlight or in any scenes where blood is present. But despite the photography, they look as good as can be. Skin tones have a very natural presentation to them and never feel too pale or over-saturated, providing for some very fine textures in hair and face wrinkles. By far the most eye-catching aspect of the camera work is the black levels. Blacks are super deep and inky, with some especially excellent line and shadow delineation amidst the many, many darkly-lit scenes and layers of clothes being worn. The detail is so great, and I was really impressed at being able to see all the little things I don't think I ever noticed on the DVD, like the scene where Hanks goes into the night club and you can clearly see the paper over the gun and lamp shades shaking to the music, or when Hanks is walking on the street in the dark and you can see all the linings between his vest, suit, and overcoat. The image is one of the finest I've seen on BD to date. Unfortunately, while just about everything else is preserved, the only detractor would be the very frequent amounts of dirt and debris throughout. Aside from that one little mishap, the picture is essentially perfect.Audio - 5.0Unlike the video, however, the audio comes across just fine and dandy. As soon as the film started and I heard the sound of the waves crashing, I knew I would be in for good things from a sound perspective. Buoyancy is a word I use a lot for audio descriptions and is a term I like to think of as identifying a quality of ""pop"" to the presentation, much like the editors and critics use for the video portions of a review. Well, the DTS-HD track here really does have a pop to it, and right from the get-go. Directionality and separation offer all kinds of goodness from proper placement to panning, to flawless mixing between dialogue and music. The sound crew was nominated for a couple of Oscars in both mixing and editing, and this BD shows exactly why. Every subtle sound, high and low, front, left, right, and back are handled with a great amount of care and detail. The dialogue is always pitch-perfect and never distorts through the center, while the occasional background noise, street crowd, blowing of wind, and car engine add a good deal of depth to the city of Chicago. Thomas Newman's score (another shocking fact to know he hasn't won an Oscar yet) sounds wonderful and emotionally stirring, propelling the drama on-screen, yet never overpowering the dialogue or sound effects. And as for the sound effects, gunshots dominate the sound field and conquer with just cause when need be. I believe this is my first time hearing a Tommy Gun in lossless audio, and boy is it frightening. LFEs are mostly inherent within the music, background and score-wise, but have a particularly great moment during the passing of a subway train when we first meet Jude Law's character. This is definitely reference material.Extras - 4.0From the DVD we get the basic making-of featurette, deleted scenes with optional commentary, and extremely poignant feature film commentary by Sam Mendes. The making-of is really as basic as it comes and isn't much to talk about. The deleted scenes provide a little more context to the story that we might not have known, yet are still surprised by. And the commentary by Mendes is as good as they come. Next to Michael Mann and Christopher Nolan, this one of the best commentaries I've heard. He's very into the explanation of the film, both from a technical and literary viewpoint, and really gets in-depth with a lot of the explanations concerning what he wanted to convey on-screen, how he did it, or why/how it's different from the original graphic novel. New to the BD is an introduction by Mendes to this new and impressive Blu-ray edition, a retrospect on the life and career of the film's master cinematographer, the late Conrad L. Hall, and an interactive library explaining some of the period elements of the film. At this point, I'm just now making it a habit of getting to know some of the technicians behind the camera, in addition to the many other important names I feel are important. And I have to say, after seeing the feature on Mr. Hall, my interest in the man has really peaked now. Before seeing this film, I knew photography could make a world of difference in the way a movie feels. And for as good as his craft was in Road to Perdition, I really am curious to see his other works at some point. As for the new library archive, I found it very interesting in terms of content, but the tiny screen thing was a problem. I'm pretty sure it can't be blown up, but personally, I wish they had just put it all together as a regular HD featurette. For what it is, though, it's full of some pretty good, albeit sparse, information.Overall - 4.5I thought the movie was pretty good when I first saw it. But knowing what I know now, and with the help of Blu-ray, I have to say I really love the film. It's a character drama that's full of heart and really draws a lot of empathy from me, personally. With Grade-A quality in all aspects of both technical and literary departments, the film is an extreme joy for me to watch, thanks in huge part to the cinematography, cast, and score. The A/V specs are definitely the pinnacle of BD technology, and it's nice to even get a blessing from Mendes himself (an admitted skeptic, initially). Add to that a great set of special features, and you have yourself a must-own piece of film-making brought graciously to you by Paramount.",5,Road to Perdition (Blu-ray),1283817600,"09 7,

Tom Hanks brilliantly (as usual) portrays a killer that is forced to fight against people, to whom he was dedicated for many years, to defend his family. I don't normally like Paul Newman as an actor but in this movie he is totaly natural playing a kind of godfather, whose love for his son is stronger than any other considerations and who is torn because of this.

598027,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B00005JLBQ,V. Berk,"[0, 0]","Few would think the 2002 crime-family drama Road to Perdition directed Academy Award winning direction Sam Mendes (American Beauty) and starring Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, and Jude Law has something in common with the likes of The Crow, Hellboy, and Batman, but the truth is they're all a part of the same family of movies.  All of these movies originated from the pages of comic books.  In this case the source is the graphic novel of the same name written by Max Allan Collins originally released in 1998.Set in the early 20th century, Road to Perdition is a crime movie, road-trip movie, and stirring father-son drama all set in the era of Al Capone. For years hit man Michael Sullivan's (Tom Hanks) has loyally served crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman).  One night, when a simple shakedown goes awry due to the erratic behavior of Rooney's son, Connor (Daniel Craig), several men are gunned down as a result, all while Sullivan's eldest son (Tyler Hoechlin) acts as witness to the murders.  Upon discovering that the boy was witness to the crime Connor Rooney takes action, killing Sullivan's wife and youngest son, but missing his primary target, Michael Sullivan, Jr. who is quickly taken on the road by his father.  With son in tow Michael Sullivan, Sr. pledges vengeance on Connor.  Meanwhile, John Rooney is forced to make the difficult decision of letting Michael have his vengeance or protecting his son, Rooney ultimately hires an assassin (Jude Law) to dispose of Sullivan before he has a chance to kill Connor.Most of the film takes place on the road with Sullivan teaching his son a lifetime of values, with stops to rob his former boss's banks and seeks forgiveness for his sins as the road brings him closer to enacting his revenge for the death of his family.  This journey is the titular Road to Perdition.The acting is as good as an audience could expect from this all-star cast, but what stands out the most are the interactions between Tom Hanks and Paul Newman (appearing in his final acting role).  A change from the graphic novel that phenomenally increases the human drama of the film is that Michael Sullivan has come to hold John Rooney as a father figure.  In return Paul Newman treats Sullivan as a surrogate son.  Paul Newman perfectly conveys the emotional conflict Rooney faces when he is forced to make the decision between putting a hit on Sullivan and letting Sullivan kill his biological son.  One can practically see his heart breaking when he is forced to make the decision.  Newman truly saved one of his career's best performances for last in his illustrious career.Even more essential to the film's success than the outstanding performances from Hanks and Newman is its cinematography.  Road to Perdition is an incredibly stylish movie, but not in the same way the graphic novel was.  Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall changes the story from an American set Samurai movie to a timeless portrait of American culture.  The Oscar winning cinematography is easily Road to Perdition's greatest strength.  Director Sam Mendes said that after the Best Picture winning American Beauty he wanted to make a film that focused more on telling its story through visuals instead of dialogue and he succeeds. The best moments in the film come when the dialogue comes to a stop it allowing the images on the film do all the talkingA financial and critical success, grossing $180 million worldwide off a budget of $80 million and nominated for six Academy Awards (winning one for Cinematography) Road to Perdition was a success, but there was a very vocal few who considered it a massive letdown during its initial release.  Some complaints were centered on the belief that the film wasn't a stirring crime drama that viewers expected; some felt it was a disappointment from the stand-point of being Mendes' immediate follow-up to the Best Picture winning American Beauty.  Most all of these complaints seem to have died down over the years, but a large percentage of the population seldom acknowledges the film on the basis that it stars Hollywood nice-guy Tom Hanks as a gangster.  This is a grave mistake, as Road to Perdition is not a gangster movie.  Road to Perdition is a familial drama which happens to have gangsters in it.  Playing a father who must take care of his son during a trying, desperate time is a role that Tom Hanks is more than suited to tackle.  To go into this movie expecting a story along the lines of Scarface or The Godfather would be to completely miss the point.Ultimately Road to Perdition should be seen as a turning point in the history of graphic novels and their adaptation into Hollywood films.  The movie is an outstanding example of writers should adapt a source material in such a way that the heart of the story is kept intact while still offering something delightful and new for those who've already read the graphic novel.  The more action oriented themes Collins' novel were muted, but the strength of the father-son relationship, which was the true heart of the graphic novel, remained completely intact, and in some ways was even improved upon in the movie.  While movies such as From Hell (2001) were the first attempt at bringing graphic novels to universal attention, Road to Perdition is the film that sealed the medium's identity as an art.  As a result of Road to Perdition the graphic novel would begin to receive the serious attention it had been denied for decades with adaptations of Alan Moore's V For Vendetta (2005), Watchmen (2009), and David Cronenberg's adaptation of John Wagner and Vince Locke's History of Violence (2005).  If Sam Mendes adaptation of Max Allan Collin's graphic novel hadn't been the critical and financial success it wound up being it seems doubtful that graphic novels would have as much attention from production companies as they do now.  For that reason Road to Perdition is perhaps the most important movie in the history of movie adaptations of graphic novels.",5,Fathers and sons,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,5971,"['Few', 'would',

Althought there is violence, gangsters and  robbery to describe it as such would be a big mistake.Instead it is also a tale of fathers and sons, family and obligations.  Both Hanks character and Newman's are confronted with choices.  For Hanks it is easy, though he is caught between his loyalty to his family and his long time mentor- revenge and protection of his son Michael are his focus. For Newman it's more difficult for Hanks almost a son to him.  But not his real son and he chooses as a father and in doing so resigns the movie to its fate.Road to Perdition is a well thought out, adult and intelligent film.  It takes its time to develop a story and treats the viewer as an intelligent observer.  Tom Hanks is excellent as an Irish Catholic mobster and family man for whom his profession is a job.
