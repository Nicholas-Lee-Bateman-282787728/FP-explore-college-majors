1637795,A36CDTPDMHWMJ,B00BQXTCYK,G. M. Curtis,"[3, 3]","The first season of Vexed was awesome. The black humour was superb and the acting on target. Season two alas has lost something of that sparkle.Lucy Punch has gone to be replaced by Miranda and her loss is keenly felt. Lucy's character was as brilliantly flawed in her own way as Toby's Jack. And she was also wonderfully strident in her criticism of Jack. But her replacement although some attempts are made to give her a set of flaws, ends up mostly just being a rather flat foil for her partner Jack's insensitive, sexist, racist (and just about everything else ist), barbs. This wouldn't be such a terrible thing save that the writers have also tamed Jack. He's in danger of losing his flamboyant boyish edginess to become just another detective with a jaundiced world view.Still there are some good moments and if you skip the first episode it does get better. Also in season two there are six episodes instead of three which is a plus. There are no extras on the discs though save a few screenshots.Overall it's a reasonable watch and I give it three stars. I'm not sure if I might have given it a little more save that it follows on from the truly wicked first season and my expectations were dashed a little.",3,It's not the first season ... sigh!,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,1216,"['first', 'season', 'Vexed', 'was', 'awesome', 'black', 'humour', 'was', 'superb', 'acting', 'target', 'Season', 'two', 'alas', 'lost', 'something', 'sparkle.Lucy', 'Punch', 'gone', 'be', 'replaced', 'Miranda', 'loss', 'keenly', 'felt', 'Lucy', 'character', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'flawed', 'own', 'way', 'Toby', 'Jack', 'was', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'strident', 'criticism', 'Jack', 'replacement', 'attempts', 'are', 'made', 'give', 'set', 'flaws', 'up', 'mostly', 'just', 'being', 'rather', 'flat', 'foil', 'partner', 'Jack', 'insensitive', 'sexist', 'racist', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'ist', 'barbs', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'terrible', 'thing', 'save', 'writers', 'have', 'also', 'tamed', 'Jack', 'danger', 'losing', 'flamboyant', 'boyish', 'edginess', 'become', 'just', 'detective', 'jaundiced', 'world', 'view.Still', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'skip', 'first', 'episode', 'get', 'better', 'Also', 'season', 'two', 'are', 'six', 'episodes', 'instead', 'three', 'plus', 'are', 'extras', 'discs', 'save', 'few', 'screenshots.Overall', 'reasonable', 'watch', 'give', 'three', 'stars', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'little', 'more', 'save', 'truly', 'wicked', 'first', 'season', 'expectations', 'were', 'dashed', 'little']","VEXED, SERIES 2"

1637806,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00BQXTCYK,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[3, 6]","In 2012 I discovered this BBC detective series from Acorn Video because I loved their nine seasons of ""New Tricks"". The first season of Vexed was short  - just three hour-long episodes - and I really liked it. I wasn't as thrilled with the main male character (played by Toby Stephens) but enjoyed his distaff detective partner portrayed by actress Lucy Punch. As I noted in my review then, I learned that the series had been renewed and was looking forward to more of the same.When I got Season Two - which now contains SIX episodes - I noted a new female face on the front of the package. This wasn't Ms. Punch.  But - what the heck - I started watching it anyway. The first episode was okay as we learned a little bit about Stephens new partner and how their relationship might work. But by the time we get to the second episode (which all revolves around character who have ""gender issues"", I was getting antsy. While the British treat sex themes more open than American broadcast channels (and I love a good dirty joke), the jokes seemed more appropriate for burlesque house. Think Benny Hill. Breast jokes, toilet jokes etc. This was not what Season One was about. They actually worked on cases you might care about. And Stephen's is even more over the top this time, while I just couldn't figure out Stephens' new partner, Georgina, (played by Miranda Raison).  I plodded through the rest of the season but it didn't improve much for me.Now, I do see that other reviewers thought that this season was better and funnier. Remembering that humor  is subjective, I'll say that maybe to some, it was better. Not for me, however.  So, I can only offer the OBJECTIVE comment that Season Two is, well, different. You just might like it. But don't go looking for any crime cases to solve here. It's all about the ""detectives""If there is a Season Three, I hope they recapture the feeling of the first one.Unlike Season One, where there was a short ""making of"" feature, this time there is only a photo gallery as a bonus.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",3,Ch-h-h-h-anges!

The male detective is the main character and really makes the shoe.  He is bold, opinionated, uneducated but despite everything he solves the case.  I do have to say that i was sorry to see the female detective from the first series left the show I thought they had perfect chemistry.  But his new partner is very good and they do make a good team.",5,This is a great show!!!!!!!,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,475,"['great', 'show', 'only', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'are', 'not', 'more', 'episodes', 'watch', 'funny', 'hell', 'watch', 'male', 'detective', 'main', 'character', 'really', 'shoe', 'bold', 'opinionated', 'uneducated', 'everything', 'case', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'i', 'was', 'sorry', 'see', 'female', 'detective', 'first', 'series', 'left', 'show', 'thought', 'had', 'perfect', 'chemistry', 'new', 'partner', 'very', 'good', 'do', 'make', 'good', 'team']","VEXED, SERIES 2"
