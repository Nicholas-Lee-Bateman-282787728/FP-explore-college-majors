Unlike R & B specials it has no evil villain to fear or hero to cheer for. The songs were not as catchy either.However, now as an adult I seem to enjoy the laid back simple story. The songs are good and I like the introduction and ending with live actors. I think what makes me appreciate this special even more are the so called Christmas specials that are produced today. I have children of my own now and neither they or I like what we see today. Thankfully they also like the Christmas specials I remember from my childhood.This Christmas special is not aired that often anymore and it seems to drift in and out of availability for DVD and VHS purchase. If you see that it is airing on television you may want to record it as it hard to come by these days.",4,This Christmas special gets better and better with age!,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,906,"['remember', 'watching', 'film', 'child', 'thinking', 'moved', 'bit', 'slow', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'R', 'B', 'evil', 'villain', 'fear', 'hero', 'cheer', 'songs', 'were', 'not', 'catchy', 'either.However', 'now', 'adult', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'laid', 'back', 'simple', 'story', 'songs', 'are', 'good', 'like', 'introduction', 'ending', 'live', 'actors', 'think', 'what', 'appreciate', 'special', 'even', 'more', 'are', 'so', 'called', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'are', 'produced', 'today', 'have', 'children', 'own', 'now', 'neither', 'like', 'what', 'see', 'today', 'Thankfully', 'also', 'like', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'remember', 'childhood.This', 'Christmas', 'special', 'not', 'aired', 'often', 'anymore', 'drift', 'availability', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'purchase', 'see', 'airing', 'television', 'may', 'want', 'record', 'come', 'days']",N/A

It was a crowded theater lobby and my sister was crabby.  But, once inside the theater, we were taken away to a western forest and introduced to a family of bears and a kind ranger.  I was hooked by the story.  This animated movie is a favorite of mine for so many reasons.  Yes, the animation is only good but the enchanting tale of believing in Santa Claus and love is whimsical and heartwarming.

The special shows Ranger Smith trying to explain the legend of Santa Claus and Nana trying to get her two cubs in the cave, so they will settle down and she can sleep, too.The animation is excellent, the songs catchy and the story, fun.  I've had several VHS copies as well as several DVD copies and no two seem to be the same.  You can find a short live-action sequence at the beginning and end of some copies or you may just find a complete animated version.
