Minutella ""mystery buff""","[9, 9]","A show about learning how to live through the reality of loss, SFU is, simply put, among the best television series ever made. The characters are flawed, funny, sad, sometimes painfully right, at others painfully wrong...and always human. No other show has touched upon how our awareness of our mortality and how grieving through loss can ultimately enrich the lives we live now. This is powerful and deeply thoughtful stuff, and the final episode, without getting into particulars, is especially heart wrenching and unforgettable. Anyone with a trace of humanity will be affected by the finale's beauty and deeply felt emotions. It also marks the death of the show itself, and that in itself is especially sad. The finale made me realize how close I felt to the characters, and seeing them go was truly a wrenching experience. I cried and was deep in thought long, long after the credits rolled.

It's already gone."", then Claire was driving away and we see the rest of everyone's lives while Sia's ""Breathe Me"" plays.Never thought SFU will have this effect on me since I always felt the characters were a little ""drama queen"", and the whole thing about ""talking to dead people"" is kind of freaky. But the ending was something I was NOT ready for. Even if it's just for these last few minutes, you should watch the complete 5th season. Have never seen a more brilliant ending for a TV series. Those 7 minutes made movie/TV history.There's only 1 flaw with the ending: Who in their righ mind would buy a new car before moving to NYC?But I am glad that Claire did. If she boarded a plane, the ending would be nowhere near as powerful.

It is interesting, engaging, dramatic  and funny, hopeful and melancholic, sarcastic but not jaded, just as we have come to expect of this riveting and powerful series.Six Feet Under is quite unique in the fact that it is one those rare shows for television that does not deteriorate in the final few seasons, but in fact gets better and better with every passing year. Most shows start with a good concept, but very few manage to keep the quality of the show as good as SFU does throughout, maintaining the interest of viewers fresh and alive for the duration.The final episode of the season and of the overall show, is a master stroke ending by Alan Ball. I watched three times in a row and it had my heart in its clutches for days after. Such a moving and powerful ending.If there is such a thing as a TV show d'auteur, SFU is it.

969349,A3I7NIXOKQJE21,B000E6EK42,Cinema4,"[13, 15]","6FU was not a show about death, it was how people dealt with the hardship of the rut that life can give to you. The only time when people look and face their lives was when someone died. For the Fisher family, who spent their existence around death, their realizations as to what to do with their lives, bad and good choices, came much slower to others.My breakdown of the characters:Nate: Brenda summed him up pretty well at how convincing he was when all he wanted in life was for someone to make him feel and seem like a better personDavid and Keith: I felt their relationship all through the show was forced and labored. It wasn't until this last season, when all their silly drama stopped, that I could take a look at them as a couple and see what we should have seen all along.Brenda: actually had the most growth out of all the characters. I felt she rounded out nicely considering her strange past with relationships. Mother hood will do that to you.Ruth: She had some of the best lines out of all the characters, period. ""Maybe it was an unfortunate lotion."" HAHAHHA People like her are  so boxed up that it is nearly impossible to free them. I hope she found happiness.Clare: She was my least favorite. Being an artist myself, and seeing the very distorted and completely inaccurate view of artists in the series, I just couldn't relate to her. She was so selfish, granted her age allowed for that, but I felt no pity for her at all. I get it, she had her whole life ahead of her, we are suppose to identify with that, but she was just annoying.Rico: I thought he was cool, and had the most conflict. A young man gifted at what he does, but with no real clout in the business until he is able to fight for what he wants and gain respect. I wish they hadn't taken the usual sexual detour with him as they did with ALL THE CHARACTERS, but hey, that seems to be what people want.The show summed up in one of the most brilliant ways I have ever seen. Looking into the future, reflecting into the past, and realizing that these five years were just that. It was a fraction of time, be it the time we were to follow, but life goes on.

969351,A2CMP5MS7GQ5OQ,B000E6EK42,Couch Potato Michael,"[0, 0]","ABOUT: Life circles around a highly dysfunctional and tragically unlucky family who own and operate a funeral home. Michael C. Hall (Dexter) stars. THE POSITIVE: The series had a successful 5 year run on HBO receiving widespread critical acclaim. Viewers will encounter a considerable range of thought provoking emotions about life and death, never considered before. THE NEGATIVE: Too many different script writers and directors from unknowns to actors such as Peter Weller (RoboCop) and Kathy Lee Bates, leave some episodes confusingly unresolved and foggy. Regardless, when the last episode is over, viewers will be wishing the series did not come to an end. Character development is slow but is quickly overlooked by the ensembles acting skills. THE UGLY: Sadly, the show has segments that are inappropriate. Toddlers and young children are present in what should be adult scenes only. During such scenes, children are subject to loud and emotionally charged adult arguments and extremely foul language, including the F bomb. THE MESSAGE: Live a happy life before it is too late as ultimately in the end of ends we are all &#8220;Six Feet Under.&#8221; THE CONCLUSION: Get ready for a believable well acted ride full of laughs, sadness and tears. Six Feet Under will make you feel like you are part of the family. The negatives and ugly put aside, &#8220;Six Feet Under&#8221; is engrossing adult only entertainment.

Did they have to suffer through that crap like me and countless other devoted fans who were there from the beginning when the show was actually good?  Apparently not because if they were I don't understand how their enthusiasm for the show wasn't at a low ebb just like mine.  I honestly tried to get back into the show and the 5th season was certainly better than the previous, but not by much.  And not enough to make me care any more.  I'm amazed at how many people were profoundly affected by the finale.  If I cared at all about the show & its characters at that point, maybe just maybe I might have shed a tear....hell even been moved without shedding a tear.  But somewhere along the way from the brilliant first season to the pretty awesome 2nd season and the good but deteriorating 3rd season up to the atrocious season 4, the creators & cast of Six Feet Under lost me and I was never able to regain my enthusiasm.  I have the first 2 seasons at home on dvd and may possibly purchase the 3rd if I find it on sale somewhere, but that's it.  If I ever get a craving for some quality SFU episodes I'll pull out my discs from seasons 1 & 2, possibly 3.  But I honestly couldn't go any further.  A shame that what was once such a fine program, in one season, deteriorated before my very eyes.

Following the Fisher family's lives as they deal with the constant reminder of death, SFU has changed television in every aspect from production to plot.  The season five boxset's featurettes are the best among the five seasons.  I recommend a viewing after watching the season.  It's a great overview of the whole series and a great closure for fans.  The first featurette is in two parts, both lasting 30 min a piece and takes a look at SFU's many elements with interviews with cast and crew members.  The second deals with the impact of the show with many interesting interviews with real life funeral home directors.  After viewing the featurettes, I felt like watching the whole season again.  As always the comentaries were both informative and intriguing.  The packaging was also very appealing and matched well with the other boxsets.New viewers:  Watch season one first.  If you don't enjoy the pilot, odds are you will not enjoy the series at all.  If you enjoyed the feature film American Beauty you will probably love Six Feet Under.  The creator Alan Ball also wrote American Beauty and both share similar styles and themes.  SFU is a dark comedy with very dramatic elements, and while many have tackled this mix of genres before, no one has ever done it with such profound humanity and beauty.  Nothing on television, before or after, has yet to match the intimacy and brilliance of SFU.Casual Viewers:  As far as the overall season, it is probably not the best in comparision to some of the earlier seasons.  But more than anything, the fifth season brings an intense and enlightening closure to a series that has impacted the way we look at a television show.  The last several episodes are among the best of the long running series as they deal with a very personal and deep tragic event.  Even if you didn't enjoy a particular season, the final season is a great way to look at the series as a whole.Fans of the show:  Many fans probably wish that SFU was still alive and running, but none will dispute that the closing of the incredible series was more complete and fulfilling than anyone could have hoped.  The execution to the final episodes deserves the greatest admiration to all the people involved.  But as in life itself, the show eventually must end.  And in closing of the series, it makes SFU that much more important and something that should influence the way we look at our own lives forever.",5,Everything.  Everyone.  Everywhere.

Yet this family and those around them are constantly confronted with reality and life's questions and spiritual meaning by way of owning and being connected to those who run a funeral home.Season 5 is full of great acting/actors, dynamic and developed characters that you care about, and you'll be hard-pressed to not get emotional during ""Ecotone,"" one of the best representations of expressing grief in today's world you'll ever experience...but again it's not something to be avoided because of its subject-matter, it's just real and powerful, versus simply shallow TV drama squeezed out between commercials (thank God there are none, which makes it a completely different, worthwhile endeavor).So glad that I came back and watched Season 5, it's endearing and an incredibly fitting ending to the series, well done Alan Ball and all of the actors/actresses that made this series a classic everyone should watch...a real microcosmic reflection of American society trying to deal with what they've created over the last 50 years.

969366,A1A535W556ROBQ,B000E6EK42,James Ferguson,"[6, 11]","You pretty much have to be a devoted fan not to notice how badly this series deteriorated over five years.  By the fifth season you are just hoping the producers will put this dysfunctional family out of its misery, as nothing seems to go right for the Fishers, especially young Nate who never seemed to regain his footing after the death of Lisa.  What started with so much promise, ends pretty sadly, as the writers struggled mightily to draw this series to a close.Nate Jr. was never very convincing.  You never do figure out where all his rage came from, other than frustration with his own failings.  The one good thing, his daughter Maya, which he keeps reminding everyone of, gets tossed around like a rag doll through seasons five as Nate tries to settle into some kind of life.  But, even when it seems he is finally able to resolve himself with Brenda, it doesn't last long.  It doesn't seem the guy deserved the second chance he got at the beginning of Season Three.The other family members are harder to pin down.  Ruth seems to go through many of the same struggles when it comes to finding an ideal mate.  George showed promise, but soon we find out he is harboring some kind of dementia and their relation quickly sours.  Bettina comes around from time to time to cheer her up, but Ruth just can't seem to find happiness.David can't seem to completely reconcile himself with Keith, even when it comes to adopting a child or having a baby through a surrogate mother.  You would think they had the ideal opportunity to make something happen with Keith's niece, Taylor, which David seemed very warm toward, but I guess the writers wanted to take this relationship through a few more twists and turns, leaving this viewer to wonder what it was all about.  For what had been arguably the best homosexual couple portrayed on television, they don't seem to find much happiness in each other.Just when Claire seemed to have some balance in her life, the floor falls out from under her in a rather unconvincing set of episodes following the tragic fate of Nate.  Claire had always been the most promising character.  Her bright cheery face lit up the increasingly morbid episodes, but eventually even Claire falls into a rather depressed state of affairs as her glimmering hope as an artist all too quickly flames out and she is forced to work as a temp secretary.

Dirty little secrets that get revealed for all the word to see...heavy drinking and drug use...illicit sex...incredibly vulgar language...counter-culture mores and all the while the writers seem to want the audience to think it normal.  EVERYONE is dysfunctional, with serious psychiatric issues that should have been treated with serious couch-time, or institutionalism.  As the seasons go on, the normalcy that was encouraged for the viewers to accept becomes more dysfunctional, and you start wondering which character will eventually turn their life around to join in the real world of human existence.  Hope comes to the viewer...and then he dies an untimely death.  In the throes of total grief, like a miracle from beyond the grave, the characters somehow overcome years of dysfunctionality...(spoil alert)..only to see in the last episode how each turns out in life...happy at last...until they all succumb - after long, happy and likely successful lives - in rapid succession.  Time for the generation left behind to take their place in line to be next to make their way in a tough, confusing, disappointing world - to find love, happiness, and their own way in this maze of a life the Good Lord has set before us all.  We work our behinds off, striving for whatever we desire...happiness, love, success, family...and it all ends the same way.This is so thought provoking, bizarre, addicting, sad, glorious, and at the same time, gives the viewer hope for our own lives.  It's not for nothing.  It was too much for me when it was new on HBO.  I had to be ready to make this trip.  I was ready and watched all the seasons almost non-stop over the last two or three weeks.

969372,A12K71MV2XDXRF,B000E6EK42,Jose Antonio Area Portaba,"[4, 4]","The fifth and final season of HBO's groundbreaking series Six Feet Under brings closure to the story of the Fisher family in such a brilliant way that it's got to be considered among the very best conclusions to any television show ever.As the fifth season begins, it develops the new stages in the lives of each of the Fishers: Nate and Brenda entering married life, David attempting to start a family with Keith, Ruth struggling to adjust to her husband George's new mental state and Claire's evergrowing conflicts both in her relationship with Billy and her art. The first half of the season compellingly sets up the characters' conflicts with an uneasy and rather disturbing foreboding that something big will happen that will turn the Fisher family's world upside down and change them forever.And something HUGE does happen halfway through the season, indeed. I will not reveal what it is, but it will not only shake the Fishers to their very core; it will also force them to face their deepest inner demons, make them come to terms with the reality of loss, and eventually help them move on with their lives.The entire final season is excellent and the acting (Frances Conroy and Lauren Ambrose are especially fantastic), directing, writing and production values are outstanding throughout, but what elevates this season to something truly extraordinary are the last 5 episodes or so, which have got to be the best run of episodes in the show's history. Shocking, morbidly funny, beautiful, tragic, disturbing, spiritual and heartbreaking; one after the other, these final episodes will leave the viewer intensely involved and emotionally drained. The final episode in particular, ends the show with such a sense of closure, satisfaction and completeness to the characters and their lives in all its encompassing happiness, sadness, tragedy and fulfillment that is so tremendously moving, eloquent and trascendental, it will likely leave you in tears.A truly perfect and unforgettable way to end one of the best shows to ever grace the small screen.",5,A Brilliant Ending to a Landmark Series,1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,2055,"['fifth', 'final', 'season', 'HBO', 'groundbreaking', 'series', 'Six', 'Feet', 'brings', 'closure', 'story', 'Fisher', 'family', 'such', 'brilliant', 'way', 'got', 'be', 'considered', 'very', 'best', 'conclusions', 'television', 'show', 'fifth', 'season', 'new', 'stages', 'lives', 'Fishers', 'Nate', 'Brenda', 'entering', 'married', 'life', 'David', 'attempting', 'start', 'family', 'Keith', 'Ruth', 'struggling', 'adjust', 'husband', 'George', 'new', 'mental', 'state', 'Claire', 'evergrowing', 'conflicts', 'relationship', 'Billy', 'art', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'compellingly', 'up', 'characters', 'conflicts', 'uneasy', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'foreboding', 'something', 'big', 'will', 'happen', 'will', 'turn', 'Fisher', 'family', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'change', 'forever.And', 'something', 'HUGE', 'happen', 'halfway', 'season', 'indeed', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'what', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'shake', 'Fishers', 'very', 'core', 'will', 'also', 'force', 'face', 'deepest', 'inner', 'demons', 'make', 'come', 'terms', 'reality', 'loss', 'eventually', 'help', 'move', 'lives.The', 'entire', 'final', 'season', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'are', 'especially', 'fantastic', 'directing', 'writing', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'outstanding', 'what', 'season', 'something', 'truly', 'extraordinary', 'are', 'last', '5', 'episodes', 'so', 'have', 'got', 'be', 'best', 'run', 'episodes', 'show', 'history', 'Shocking', 'morbidly', 'funny', 'beautiful', 'tragic', 'disturbing', 'spiritual', 'heartbreaking', 'one', 'other', 'final', 'episodes', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'intensely', 'involved', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'final', 'episode', 'particular', 'show', 'sense', 'closure', 'satisfaction', 'completeness', 'characters', 'lives', 'encompassing', 'happiness', 'sadness', 'tragedy', 'fulfillment', 'so', 'tremendously', 'moving', 'eloquent', 'trascendental', 'will', 'likely', 'leave', 'tears.A', 'truly', 'perfect', 'unforgettable', 'way', 'end', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'grace', 'small', 'screen']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Fifth Season

969375,A2DXOD9HQBE1FL,B000E6EK42,"Kevin Rienecker ""Kev""","[5, 14]","Not having HBO, I came into Six Feet Under late, while I was a district manager for a small, local chain of video stores, after the hearty endorsement of several good customers. Taking their word, I rented and watched the entire first season with my girlfriend over a long weekend getaway.I don't know if we'd have felt the same way about the show, having to watch each episode play out over the course of an entire season, as opposed to being able to watch a season at a time on DVD, one after another; therefore keeping each show fresh in our minds. But needless to say, we were hooked, and we've burned through the first four seasons in less than a year.Six Feet Under might never be regarded as classic television, but I've been affected by it, despite a noted dip in quality this last couple years, as the show often devolved into soap opera-ish clich&eacute;'s, where often every scene seemed to consist of tantrums and fights and bed-hopping instead of digging into the heart of the Fisher family and the themes that were so central to the shows early success: the cycle of birth, life, and death, and the Fisher's (and in effect, our culture's) attitudes towards them.Fortunately even during the low points there was plenty to keep us hooked: Nate and Brenda and their co-dependency and completely dysfunctional familial relationships; David and Keith, possibly the deepest, best written homosexual roles ever in a mainstream television series (or film, for that matter); Ruth, and all of her relationship woes, especially with second husband George; and finally Claire, and her slow coming of age. More often than not, bits and pieces of each episode have stayed with me, playing in my mind, often days after watching them.Unfortunately, all good things come to an end. And for better or worse we've come to the fifth and final season of this crazy, intimate little show about a family of funeral directors.The first thing that struck me while watching season five was that the show seemed to suddenly get back on track, even while the annoying character traits (all the constant bickering and quick-sex-fixes-everything mentality) were still present. And as the series began to wind down and on-going plot lines were tied up, I began to realize how much these goofy characters had grown to mean to me. If you can consider fictional people family, well, with all their exaggerated faults and foibles, these folks were darn close.So what comes around goes around. Creator/producer Alan Ball returns to write and direct the last episode of his brainchild.Without spoiling too much here (apologies to those of you who are haven't yet finished!), after Nate's death, I was glad to see the entire family finally come together: to see Ruth grieve and then heal after the loss of her favored son, become the nurturing matriarch of the Fisher family, and then ease into her own life apart from her children; to see David finally come to grips with his own inner demons (figuratively and literally) and settle in with a family of his own; to see Rico and Vanessa reconcile, then break away from the Fishers for a new beginning; and again, Claire, as she finally began to grow up and move away from the safety of the family roost and out into the big, bright world.After watching this last show, I was left drained mentally and emotionally, but wondering if maybe everything hadn't been wrapped up just a bit too neatly - Claire saying her goodbyes and driving off into the great unknown could have been enough, but mixing in the montage of everyone meeting their eventual ends left me a little put-off, even while keeping with the continuity of the show's birth-to-death premise.However, all that being said, it's strange enough for a TV show to make me laugh out loud, much less run an emotional rollercoaster for six months, err, five seasons. I'll miss this nutty family of morticians - those long weekends at the cabin just won't be the same without them to keep us company.So, thanks, Mr. Ball: If only more television could be like this.",4,And all good things come to an end.

969377,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000E6EK42,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[30, 37]","For me there were two key moments that defined the dynamic of the fifth and final season of ""Six Feet Under"" for me.  The first was in ""Singing for Our Lives"" when Keith has once again sent Durrell to his room for going on a joy ride and Anthony explains his brother's philosophy of having all the fun you can while you can, because you are going to be sent back to the foster home.  The key moment is when Keith suddenly understands what is going on and for him everything changes with those two boys the rest of the way, even if David is slow to notice.  The second comes in the following episode, ""Ecotone,"" when Nate ends up in the hospital having emergency brain surgery when he is felled by AVM seizure after sleeping with Maggie.  There he is laid up in a hospital bed, his head swathed in bandages, having returned from death's door, and he tells his pregnant wife of nine episodes that their marriage is over.  Ten minutes later he ends up back on the other side of that door because at that point he deserved death more than he deserved happiness.  Two men make two choices, one is right and one is wrong.The characters on ""Six Feet Under"" make a lot of significant choices that final season, although they are not always aware which one is more important.  David thinks the decision to adopt Durrell and Anthony is the important one, but it is facing the internal demons that terrify him that is more important.  Keith's decision to love Durrell no matter what is important, but it was set up by that moment in the office of the foster home where he did not bat an eye at the fact that Anthony had an older brother.  I must admit that I always cared about David and Keith more than I did about Nate and Brenda, so the way things played out did not upset me as much as they might have otherwise.  The big surprise with Nate and Brenda turns out to be that he was ultimately more self-destructive than she was, but still the basic irony that was except for their initial encoutner in that closet at the airport, these two were never really on the same page ever again.  That is why the nadir of the season for me was not Nate's death, but his final confrontation with Brenda and it was not until Brenda's dream in which Nathaniel introduces himself, noting that they have never met, that the nightmare of his final act finally ends.  But then Nate's death and the grief it brings is what allows each of the Fishers to move on.Clearly people come apart so that they can be put back together in these twelve episodes.  It is Frederico's bitter declaration to Vanessa that he knows his affair has cost him everything, that makes it possible for them to go on.  As Vanessa tells him, they cannot go back and indeed they do not.  He cannot forgive himself for having destroyed his family and she cannot forgive herself for still loving him, and that provides the common ground they need to go on.  The reconciliation that I cannot really explain is Ruth and George.  Not because George does not deserve to come back into her life given the support he gives Ruth in the wake of Nate's death, but because there is no real rhyme or reason to George's transformation beyond the idea it provides a grace note.  At least the stability that Billy shows over the final episodes can be readily attributed to drugs.  But Ruth's relationship to George is a minor concern as she copes with the death of her first born and the painful sight of her depositing a shovel of dirt on Nate's body in his grave.In the end the show comes to Claire, not just because she belts out that infamous ode to panty hose, ""You Ride Up My Thigh,"" but more because she is the one who drives off into the future at the end.  Of course it is Claire.  She has the most talent, but she also has the most future and there is a sense in which what is ultimately important in the end is not love, but time.  Claire might not deserve to live a hundred years when others do not, but it is certainly a sweet deal if you can get it.  Besides, I think of her as Ruth's surrogate and that she is heading down that open highway not for herself, but for the rest of her fatally flawed family.  ""Everyone's Waiting"" was a brilliant final episode that redeemed the faults and failures of the final season.  Of course Alan Ball had to show us the deaths of the entire cast and fade to white to tell us when they died.  I lost count as to how many times I had to listen to Sia Furler's ""Breathe Me"" before the end sequence of the haunting series finale ""Everything Ends"" was exorcised from my mind, but it took at least a week.  Fortunately I had the CD so that I could at least get away from rewatching the episode's end over and over again.  Still, those words become the benediction for ""Six Feet Under"":Be my friendHold me, wrap me upUnfold meI am smallI'm needyWarm me upAnd breathe me",5,A Post Mortem on the final fates of the flawed Fishers & Friends,1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,4843,"['were', 'two', 'key', 'moments', 'defined', 'dynamic', 'fifth', 'final', 'season', 'Six', 'Feet', 'first', 'was', 'Singing', 'Lives', 'when', 'Keith', 'once', 'again', 'sent', 'Durrell', 'room', 'going', 'joy', 'ride', 'Anthony', 'brother', 'philosophy', 'having', 'fun', 'can', 'can', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'sent', 'back', 'foster', 'home', 'key', 'moment', 'when', 'Keith', 'suddenly', 'what', 'going', 'everything', 'changes', 'two', 'boys', 'rest', 'way', 'even', 'David', 'slow', 'notice', 'second', 'following', 'episode', 'Ecotone', 'when', 'Nate', 'up', 'hospital', 'having', 'emergency', 'brain', 'surgery', 'when', 'felled', 'AVM', 'seizure', 'sleeping', 'Maggie', 'laid', 'up', 'hospital', 'bed', 'head', 'swathed', 'bandages', 'having', 'returned', 'death', 'door', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'nine', 'episodes', 'marriage', 'Ten', 'minutes', 'later', 'up', 'back', 'other', 'side', 'door', 'point', 'deserved', 'death', 'more', 'deserved', 'happiness', 'Two', 'men', 'make', 'two', 'choices', 'one', 'right', 'one', 'wrong.The', 'characters', 'Six', 'Feet', 'make', 'lot', 'significant', 'choices', 'final', 'season', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'aware', 'one', 'more', 'important', 'David', 'decision', 'adopt', 'Durrell', 'Anthony', 'important', 'one', 'facing', 'internal', 'demons', 'terrify', 'more', 'important', 'Keith', 'decision', 'love', 'Durrell', 'matter', 'what', 'important', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'moment', 'office', 'foster', 'home', 'where', 'did', 'not', 'bat', 'eye', 'fact', 'Anthony', 'had', 'older', 'brother', 'must', 'admit', 'always', 'cared', 'David', 'Keith', 'more', 'did', 'about', 'Nate', 'Brenda', 'way', 'things', 'played', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'upset', 'as', 'much', 'might', 'have', 'otherwise', 'big', 'surprise', 'Nate', 'Brenda', 'out', 'be', 'was', 'ultimately', 'more', 'self-destructive', 'was', 'still', 'basic', 'irony', 'was', 'initial', 'encoutner', 'closet', 'airport', 'two', 'were', 'never', 'really', 'same', 'page', 'ever', 'again', 'why', 'nadir', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'Nate', 'death', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Brenda', 'was', 'not', 'Brenda', 'dream', 'Nathaniel', 'noting', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'nightmare', 'final', 'act', 'finally', 'then', 'Nate', 'death', 'grief', 'what', 'Fishers', 'move', 'on.Clearly', 'people', 'come', 'apart', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'back', 'together', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'Frederico', 'bitter', 'declaration', 'Vanessa', 'affair', 'cost', 'everything', 'possible', 'go', 'Vanessa', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'indeed', 'do', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'forgive', 'having', 'destroyed', 'family', 'can', 'not', 'forgive', 'herself', 'still', 'loving', 'common', 'ground', 'need', 'go', 'reconciliation', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'explain', 'Ruth', 'George', 'Not', 'George', 'not', 'deserve', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'given', 'support', 'Ruth', 'wake', 'Nate', 'death', 'real', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'George', 'transformation', 'idea', 'grace', 'note', 'least', 'stability', 'Billy', 'final', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'readily', 'attributed', 'drugs', 'Ruth', 'relationship', 'George', 'minor', 'concern', 'death', 'first', 'born', 'painful', 'sight', 'depositing', 'shovel', 'dirt', 'Nate', 'body', 'grave.In', 'end', 'show', 'Claire', 'not', 'just', 'out', 'infamous', 'ode', 'panty', 'hose', 'Ride', 'My', 'Thigh', 'more', 'one', 'who', 'off', 'future', 'end', 'course', 'Claire', 'most', 'talent', 'also', 'most', 'future', 'sense', 'what', 'ultimately', 'important', 'end', 'not', 'love', 'time', 'Claire', 'might', 'not', 'deserve', 'live', 'hundred', 'years', 'when', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'certainly', 'sweet', 'deal', 'can', 'get', 'think', 'Ruth', 'surrogate', 'heading', 'down', 'open', 'highway', 'not', 'rest', 'fatally', 'flawed', 'family', 'Everyone', 'Waiting', 'was', 'brilliant', 'final', 'episode', 'redeemed', 'faults', 'failures', 'final', 'season', 'course', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'had', 'show', 'deaths', 'entire', 'cast', 'fade', 'white', 'tell', 'when', 'died', 'lost', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'listen', 'Sia', 'Furler', 'Breathe', 'Me', 'end', 'sequence', 'haunting', 'series', 'finale', 'Everything', 'Ends', 'was', 'exorcised', 'mind', 'took', 'least', 'week', 'Fortunately', 'had', 'CD', 'could', 'least', 'get', 'away', 'rewatching', 'episode', 'end', 'over', 'again', 'Still', 'words', 'become', 'benediction', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Be', 'friendHold', 'wrap', 'upUnfold', 'meI', 'am', 'smallI', ""'m"", 'needyWarm', 'upAnd']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Fifth Season

So far I only own Season 1, but I'm probably going to buy Season 5 before I complete the rest of my collection. Unlike many shows, ""Six Feet Under"" really shined during its final season. (I'm going to give away some spoilers now, so stop reading this if you don't want to know all the details of Season 5!)The series could not have ended any better...I was so pleased with the way things turned out. From the moment Nate said ""Narm,"" I knew he was going to bite it before the show ended. It was very sad to watch the death of one of my favorite characters, but it was so incredibly well done and the show did an amazing job of showing how the rest of the family coped with Nate's passing and moved on.The final episode of the season is incredible. The only way to end a show like ""Six Feet Under"" is to show how all the characters eventually died, and that's exactly what happened. The final 15 minutes of the last episode are amazing...I think I watched the death montage about 50 times right after it first aired. Rumor has it that there is going to be an extended death montage on the DVD so we can see how some of the other characters like Billy and Margaret die. I can't wait to see that!It sucks that ""Six Feet Under"" only lasted for five seasons, but it followed such a great story arc and extending the show would have ruined it.

Yes, all drama is conflict, even all comedy.  But compelling drama takes us on a ride; the writers, actors and director entertain us, and in some cases (but not this one) even force us to question our established beliefs.  This show took us on that ride, providing soapy entertainment for the first three seasons; but then the ride started going in tired circles, providing conflict without dramatic tension, only more yelling and crying and sex and actions seemingly driven by nothing more than the screenwriter's need to fill the pages.  While Six Feet Under never activated the centers of higher reasoning in my own brain, it seems to have taken others on a flight of mystical self-discovery.  Well, I guess that's preferable and less disturbing to friends and family than their actually joining a creepy cult.  Case in point:  our nutsy friend above from Newquay, jewel of the Cornish Riviera and surfing capital of England, who lashes out at anyone who won't join him in his puddle of tears over the passing of ""his show,"" calling them stupid.  He says they don't get the point of the show, then fails to mention just what that point is.  When a show delves into the scary subject of mortality it has an almost unfair advantage upon our attention.

However, the season as a whole did indeed have some minor blips that keep it from being as great a collection asSeason Threeor as consistent as thefirst two seasons.  However, as I said before, the way this season--and series--ends is quite beautiful, and those episode leading up to the pitch perfect swan song do, indeed, make up for the awkwardness of the way the season started.After the somewhat weakerfourth season, ""Six Feet Under"" bounces back with more beautiful and hilarious episodes showing the Fishers and those around them struggling with death in brand new, heart-wrenching ways.  As stated before, the first few episodes of this season do indeed have the directionless feeling that thefourth seasonsuffered from.  However, even when it's at its weakest, there is such intelligence and heart put into the writing and, at another level, a bubbling tension that makes you know they're building up to something bigger and tragic.  And indeed they are.From the shocking ""Ecotone,"" to ""All Alone,"" a perfect dissection of grief that, quite frankly, is better than any literature, to the series finale ""Everyone's Waiting,"" this show hit its high note in the end, surpassing the brilliance that had been achieved in earlier seasons.  By the time you're watching that final goodbye montage, you'll have forgotten all about the weaker moments earlier in the season.  I very much recommend this, but only if the show is watched in order, from start to finish.It's not a perfect season, and it's not a 10/10.  But it's damn close.  Perhaps it's not consistent, but each episode has something hilarious, something smart, and something beautiful, and even at it's weakest, it's better than most everything else on television.  I'll miss this show dearly, because not only are the character's one of a kind, the show itself is one of the top five of all time.

Sometimes the occasional episode spanning its five seasons seemed amiss, but the cast members...every one of them...always delivered maximum and wholly believable performances. ""Six Feet Under"" set itself apart and redeemed itself mightly in its fifth and final season. Human life, as we all know too well is not an uncomplicated thing and Alan Ball, the creator of this inspired series reached deep inside himself in calling upon all his creative powers and gifts to write and direct the magnificent closing opus. The final episode was entirely satisfying in its profoundly moving yet deeply disturbing way. The unfolding imagery of the final few minutes will resonate with me for the rest of my days. I don't think I will ever again view death and funerals and loss and sorrow in the same way.  The series effectively conveyed something dark and unspoken about our culture and its collective, even repressed attitude towards the subject of death. I believe ""Six Feet Under"" will be long remembered with some measure of respect for its frank discussion of a fundamentally sensitive topic. I am grateful to all those creative people who had a hand in its production.

969402,AEGQWVR6KWBV,B000E6EK42,"Ron Cronovich ""Ron""","[119, 128]","WARNING:  If you haven't watched Season 5 yet, be VERY CAREFUL - some of your fellow Amazonians have peppered their reviews with spoilers, such as the (otherwise excellent) review by Lawrance M. Bernabo.  I will avoid spoilers here.The 5th and final season of 6FU lets us spend 12 more hours with our friends Nate, David, Ruth, Claire, Brenda, and Keith.  Season 5 includes more of the great drama, great acting, and dark, off-beat humor that 6FU fans love so much.Season 5 begins where Season 4 left off:  Nate and Brenda have decided to get married and have a baby.  As any 6FU fan could guess, neither of these events will go smoothly, nor will the decision to marry make their relationship suddenly problem-free.Keith and David want children and are exploring adoption as well as hiring a surrogate.  One way or another, they will become successful in this endeavor, but will find that a child does not solve all their problems, but rather poses new challenges to each of them and their relationship with each other (just as in real life).Toward the end of Season 4, Claire was starting to realize but not really accept that she might never be a great artist, and we saw her go down a spiral into depression and excessive drug use.  In Season 5, she starts to get a grip.  Having dropped out of art school, she gets a common office job through a temp agency, where she is totally out of her element - her coworkers vote Republican, use Splenda in their Mochaccinos, and hang out at chain restaurants like Chilis and Olive Garden.  This storyline results in interesting experiences and personal growth for Claire, and maybe a new relationship with someone she never would have expected to fall in love with.Ruth's storylines mainly involve George.  You'll recall from Seasons 3 & 4, these two lovebirds rushed into marriage after a very brief but intense infatuation.  Then Ruth soon found out all kinds of nasty surprises about George - his many ex-wives, his lousy relationship with his children, and most of all, his extreme mental health problems which put a huge strain on his and Ruth's fledgling marriage.  In Season 5, Ruth and George go through more changes and eventually resolve the question of whether they will stay together.Something BIG happens in the 8th or 9th episode, which sets up storylines and conflicts for the last 3 episodes.  If you care about these characters, it will affect you.The final episode resolves each main character's central issue or conflict.  There is a final gathering at the dinner table and a memorial of sorts, and then the episode leaves you with a very bittersweet feeling as we say goodbye to each of our friends forever.I do not believe Season 5 is the best season of this excellent show.  I'm not sure that the writing is as consistently excellent as in past seasons.  A few of the characters' plot arcs from previous seasons are recycled in Season 5.  For example, how many times do we have to watch Billy go off his meds and become annoying and dangerous to the people who love him?  Don't worry, I'm not giving anything away here - you'll see it coming a mile away.  Other multi-episode story arcs bring old demons back to haunt Nate and David, when we'd thought they had dealt with and resolved these issues in previous seasons.But these are relatively minor quibbles.  Mostly, Season 5 is very, very good, and a fine finish to an outstanding series.  After the last episode, you'll feel sad that this show is over, and you'll miss these characters.Finally, I think the price is way too high for a mere 12 episodes.  HBO is very greedy for charging so much.  Other networks typically charge 40-50 bucks for a season with almost twice as many episodes.  At the high prices HBO charges for shows like 6FU and Sopranos, many viewers will opt to rent from Netflix rather than buy, and greedy HBO ends up being worse off in the end.",5,"6FU, RIP",1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,3884,"['WARNING', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Season', '5', 'yet', 'be', 'VERY', 'CAREFUL', 'fellow', 'Amazonians', 'have', 'peppered', 'reviews', 'spoilers', 'such', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'review', 'Lawrance', 'M.', 'Bernabo', 'will', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'here.The', '5th', 'final', 'season', '6FU', 'lets', 'spend', '12', 'more', 'hours', 'friends', 'Nate', 'David', 'Ruth', 'Claire', 'Brenda', 'Keith', 'Season', '5', 'more', 'great', 'drama', 'great', 'acting', 'dark', 'off-beat', 'humor', '6FU', 'fans', 'love', 'so', 'much.Season', '5', 'begins', 'where', 'Season', '4', 'left', 'off', 'Nate', 'Brenda', 'have', 'decided', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'baby', '6FU', 'fan', 'could', 'guess', 'events', 'will', 'go', 'smoothly', 'will', 'decision', 'marry', 'make', 'relationship', 'suddenly', 'problem-free.Keith', 'David', 'want', 'children', 'are', 'exploring', 'adoption', 'as', 'well', 'hiring', 'surrogate', 'One', 'way', 'will', 'become', 'successful', 'endeavor', 'will', 'find', 'child', 'not', 'solve', 'problems', 'rather', 'new', 'challenges', 'relationship', 'other', 'just', 'real', 'life', '.Toward', 'end', 'Season', '4', 'Claire', 'was', 'starting', 'realize', 'not', 'really', 'accept', 'might', 'never', 'be', 'great', 'artist', 'saw', 'go', 'down', 'spiral', 'depression', 'excessive', 'drug', 'use', 'Season', '5', 'get', 'grip', 'Having', 'dropped', 'art', 'school', 'common', 'office', 'job', 'temp', 'agency', 'where', 'totally', 'element', 'coworkers', 'vote', 'Republican', 'use', 'Splenda', 'Mochaccinos', 'hang', 'out', 'chain', 'restaurants', 'Chilis', 'Olive', 'Garden', 'storyline', 'results', 'interesting', 'experiences', 'personal', 'growth', 'Claire', 'maybe', 'new', 'relationship', 'someone', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'fall', 'love', 'with.Ruth', 'storylines', 'mainly', 'involve', 'George', ""'ll"", 'recall', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'two', 'lovebirds', 'rushed', 'marriage', 'very', 'brief', 'intense', 'infatuation', 'Then', 'Ruth', 'soon', 'found', 'kinds', 'nasty', 'surprises', 'George', 'many', 'ex-wives', 'lousy', 'relationship', 'children', 'most', 'extreme', 'mental', 'health', 'problems', 'put', 'huge', 'strain', 'Ruth', 'fledgling', 'marriage', 'Season', '5', 'Ruth', 'George', 'go', 'more', 'changes', 'eventually', 'resolve', 'question', 'will', 'stay', 'together.Something', 'BIG', 'happens', '8th', '9th', 'episode', 'up', 'storylines', 'conflicts', 'last', '3', 'episodes', 'care', 'characters', 'will', 'affect', 'you.The', 'final', 'episode', 'main', 'character', 'central', 'issue', 'conflict', 'final', 'gathering', 'dinner', 'table', 'memorial', 'sorts', 'then', 'episode', 'very', 'bittersweet', 'feeling', 'say', 'goodbye', 'friends', 'forever.I', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'Season', '5', 'best', 'season', 'excellent', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'writing', 'as', 'consistently', 'excellent', 'past', 'seasons', 'few', 'characters', 'plot', 'previous', 'seasons', 'are', 'recycled', 'Season', '5', 'example', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'do', 'have', 'watch', 'Billy', 'go', 'off', 'meds', 'become', 'annoying', 'dangerous', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'here', ""'ll"", 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'Other', 'multi-episode', 'story', 'arcs', 'bring', 'old', 'demons', 'back', 'haunt', 'Nate', 'David', 'when', ""'d"", 'thought', 'had', 'dealt', 'resolved', 'issues', 'previous', 'seasons.But', 'are', 'relatively', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'Mostly', 'Season', '5', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'fine', 'finish', 'outstanding', 'series', 'last', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'sad', 'show', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'characters.Finally', 'think', 'price', 'way', 'too', 'high', 'mere', '12', 'episodes', 'HBO', 'very', 'greedy', 'charging', 'so', 'much', 'Other', 'networks', 'typically', 'charge', '40-50', 'bucks', 'season', 'almost', 'twice', 'many', 'episodes', 'high', 'prices', 'HBO', 'charges', 'shows', '6FU', 'Sopranos', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'opt', 'rent', 'Netflix', 'rather', 'buy', 'greedy', 'HBO', 'up', 'being', 'worse', 'off', 'end']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Fifth Season
969403,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B000E6EK42,Ron,"[1, 1]","I just finished the fifth season of SFU and I can say that it wasn't on my top 20 list of all time great showns.It does have its moments where its touching and clever, but it has way to much DARK MATTER for material for me.The show is about a family and the family business of Fisher & Sons Mortuary. The show intertwines the families life and the business and how they revolve around each other. The show stories can and do get very dark at times and is to be expected given the family business.The family has more than their share of bad luck/choices in their lives and its these issues that are the driving force for the show. All have a full bag of baggage and then some as they deal with the loss of their father and try to go on with their lives and the family businessThe family is an odd bunch that never seemed to communicate with one another and didn't really know their father that well at all! They begin to find out about their father through (ghostly) visits with him and by some detective work with the businesses invoices. They are also visited by the departed of their customers who tell their stories too along with surviving members  .The characters acting is very good for the most part with a few exceptions like Claire (Lauren Ambrose) and a couple of other part-time cast members.By the time the fifth season rolled around I had had about all I could take of redundancy of most of the lead characters life choice antics and there consequences. None of the characters seemed to be able to change their ways so they were caught in this revolving door of bad behavior and or choices that accomplished nothing except causing themselves and the people around them grief and harm.Yes, these stories did emulate real life on many occasions and for me were the downfall of the show and it leaving me with fond memories of the cast and the show in general.Was it a good show? Yes, if you like the dark side of characters and their stories. Was it compelling? Yes, at times. Did it have some life lessons? Yes, on occasion.The show is filled with drug/alcohol use, sex (gay sexual situations throughout the show for those who may take offense) and nudity (a lot of bed hopping by many of the cast) with some fairly graphic scenes of death and a few scenes of graphic violence. There is also a fair amount of cursing including the F...word throughout the series.

969404,A36Y2UJIH0L3E2,B000E6EK42,"S. Lee ""Art Not in Heaven""","[6, 9]","That long quote I put in the title box comes from Maggie, George's daughter who plays an unexpectedly crucial role in this, final, season of SFU. On Nate's 40th birthday, Brenda gathers family and friends together at their home and throws a surprise party for him, which, despite her good intentions, quickly turns into a nightmarish experience not only to him and her but others as well. Surrounded by people he cannot connect with, Nate seeks an escape in the bedroom (was it his and Brenda's bedroom? I'll have to check), where Maggie is having her own hideout. The two strike up a conversation, and our Nate, just like the Nate we know, begins to, say, ""pour his heart out"": ""All I get out of my 40th birthday is that life is  f**king lonely."" To this, Maggie, in her overly calm, Quaker way, responds: ""If you think life is a vending machine, where you put in virtue and take out happiness, you're probably gonna get disappointed. I know that.""We may take this as a Quaker's homespun wisdom or we may go overboard and compare it with what Socrates says in Republic, that justice (meaning, virtue) and knowledge *should* make us happy. We may even go further and how such Socratism, this unbridled optimism (if you will), is attacked by Nietzsche in his The Birth of Tragedy. Well, I may sound like I'm (trying to be) kidding, but I'm not. I have admired SFU intensely for many reasons, and one of them was that it often made me run to the bookshelf and earnestly open books whose existence I haven't really thought about for a long time. It's strange, come to think of it, that somehow great books, films, and shows all seem to find a way into each other. Somehow. Do they exist as a family, and come from the same origin?!The end of SFU marked an end of an era of sort to me. Not having HBO subscrition until recently, I had to wait till early April this year for the DVD release to watch the final season. I now own all five seasons on DVD, and adding the final season to my collection, I felt as if, the world of SFU is now *complete* and on its own, and I'd have to let it live on its own. It is as if, through the fourth season, the Fisher family felt like a part of my own extended family, but now I feel more like a *visitor* to their world. Not all SFU fans would share this, weird, feeling. Well, I think it is actually a sense of loss, which comes from knowing that their world is indeed complete/completed now.",5,"if you think life is a vending machine, where you put in virtue and take out happiness, you're gonna be disappointed..",1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,2426,"['long', 'quote', 'put', 'title', 'box', 'Maggie', 'George', 'daughter', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'crucial', 'role', 'final', 'season', 'SFU', 'Nate', '40th', 'birthday', 'Brenda', 'gathers', 'family', 'together', 'home', 'surprise', 'party', 'good', 'intentions', 'quickly', 'nightmarish', 'experience', 'not', 'only', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'Surrounded', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'connect', 'Nate', 'escape', 'bedroom', 'was', 'Brenda', 'bedroom', ""'ll"", 'have', 'check', 'where', 'Maggie', 'having', 'own', 'hideout', 'two', 'strike', 'conversation', 'Nate', 'just', 'Nate', 'know', 'say', 'pour', 'heart', 'out', 'get', '40th', 'birthday', 'life', 'f**king', 'lonely', 'Maggie', 'overly', 'calm', 'Quaker', 'way', 'think', 'life', 'vending', 'machine', 'where', 'put', 'virtue', 'take', 'out', 'happiness', ""'re"", 'probably', 'gon', 'get', 'disappointed', 'know', 'may', 'take', 'Quaker', 'homespun', 'wisdom', 'may', 'go', 'overboard', 'compare', 'what', 'Socrates', 'Republic', 'justice', 'meaning', 'virtue', '*should*', 'make', 'happy', 'may', 'even', 'go', 'further', 'how', 'such', 'Socratism', 'unbridled', 'optimism', 'will', 'attacked', 'Nietzsche', 'Birth', 'Tragedy', 'Well', 'may', 'sound', ""'m"", 'trying', 'be', 'kidding', ""'m"", 'not', 'have', 'admired', 'SFU', 'intensely', 'many', 'reasons', 'one', 'was', 'often', 'made', 'run', 'bookshelf', 'earnestly', 'open', 'books', 'existence', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'thought', 'long', 'time', 'strange', 'come', 'think', 'somehow', 'great', 'books', 'films', 'seem', 'find', 'way', 'other', 'Somehow', 'Do', 'exist', 'family', 'come', 'same', 'origin', 'end', 'SFU', 'marked', 'end', 'era', 'sort', 'Not', 'having', 'HBO', 'subscrition', 'recently', 'had', 'wait', 'till', 'early', 'April', 'year', 'DVD', 'release', 'watch', 'final', 'season', 'now', 'own', 'five', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'adding', 'final', 'season', 'collection', 'felt', 'world', 'SFU', 'now', '*complete*', 'own', ""'d"", 'have', 'let', 'live', 'own', 'fourth', 'season', 'Fisher', 'family', 'felt', 'part', 'own', 'extended', 'family', 'now', 'feel', 'more', '*visitor*', 'world', 'Not', 'SFU', 'fans', 'would', 'share', 'weird', 'feeling', 'Well', 'think', 'actually', 'sense', 'loss', 'knowing', 'world', 'indeed', 'complete/completed', 'now']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Fifth Season

Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[49, 76]","Going into the fifth season of ""six feet under"" I knew two things: a) that this was going to be the final year and that b) the fourth season seems really out of place for me.  I honestly had no idea what to expect, but I kept watching and the main pattern that I noticed was that teh show was getting... almost tedious (for lack of a better word).  It seemed like the writters where finally having to really scrap to get the good stories.But then in the middle of the season an event happend that took the show in such a jurasic new direction, the quality instantly jumped and successfuly succeded the second season as the most interesting, thought pervoking, and plain weird group of episodes  I have ever watched.And then the finale, ""Everybody's Waiting"" is a fan's wet dream when it comes to series finale.  TV history has not been kind to series finale's to major series (i.g. most of them suck ass).  But ""Six Feet Under"", like everything else, is the exception to the rule.  Over the course of the 75 minutes I cried, laughed, got scared, and help and overwhelimging sense of completion and joy where it comes from the character's arcs.  And the last 10 minutes I will never forget as Long as I live, it was so haunting (in a good way).",5,Everyone's Waiting,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,1243,"['Going', 'fifth', 'season', 'six', 'feet', 'knew', 'two', 'things', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'final', 'year', 'b', 'fourth', 'season', 'really', 'place', 'honestly', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'kept', 'watching', 'main', 'pattern', 'noticed', 'was', 'teh', 'show', 'was', 'getting', 'almost', 'tedious', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'seemed', 'writters', 'where', 'finally', 'having', 'really', 'scrap', 'get', 'good', 'stories.But', 'then', 'middle', 'season', 'event', 'happend', 'took', 'show', 'such', 'jurasic', 'new', 'direction', 'quality', 'instantly', 'jumped', 'successfuly', 'succeded', 'second', 'season', 'most', 'interesting', 'thought', 'pervoking', 'plain', 'weird', 'group', 'episodes', 'have', 'ever', 'watched.And', 'then', 'finale', 'Everybody', 'Waiting', 'fan', 'wet', 'dream', 'when', 'series', 'finale', 'TV', 'history', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'series', 'finale', 'major', 'series', 'i.g', 'most', 'suck', 'ass', 'Six', 'Feet', 'everything', 'else', 'exception', 'rule', 'course', '75', 'minutes', 'cried', 'laughed', 'got', 'scared', 'help', 'overwhelimging', 'sense', 'completion', 'joy', 'where', 'character', 'arcs', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'as', 'Long', 'live', 'was', 'so', 'haunting', 'good', 'way']",Six Feet Under - The Complete Fifth Season
