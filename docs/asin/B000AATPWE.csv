Some of the footage you may recognize was used in later documentaries and retrospectives on the Beach Boys. If you are a big fan you will really enjoy this.I recorded this from TV on a VCR many years ago. The video quality of this DVD isn't much better than my tape. I think the original negative should have been found so it could have been restored properly..if possible.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[4, 5]","I often have to point this out in my reviews here on Amazon but Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL the reviews of ALL versions of a title with the same name and sorts by helpfulness. So this review of the June 2013 DVD release by EagleVision is being grouped with the 2005 DVD release. So it's always best to sort reviews by review date and see which version the review is covering.That said, this new release is the same as the earlier one and probably the same as the 1970s Broadway Video release. As my fellow reviewers have pointed out:1) This is not a ""concert video"" but a 55 minute TV special produced by the BBs which includes home movies and interviews and some songs that are from a concert.2) It has not been cleaned up or remastered and it shows it's age and even some framing issues.3) It is interesting for BB fans but certainly not essential for the casual music lover. There are better Beach Boys performances out there.Earlier versions seem to bringing high process on Amazon and so it's nice that Eagle Vision is reissuing it at under $10 list price.

925725,A23LCEFE2BWE5F,B000AATPWE,Tuco,"[32, 34]","Finally got around to buying this title.  First and foremost, those looking for some live Brian Wilson stage action circa 1976 will be disappointed.  He sings no songs onstage and they don't even cut to him the few times he is on the piano.  I saw no footage of him on bass either.Instead, the value of this DVD is held mostly in the studio performances:I'm Bugged at my Old Man - Bri, Dennis and Carl around a piano.  Notice them all looking at each other and laughing at some of the lyrics as if they might have been true happenings in the Wilson household.That Same Song - Live in a baptist church with the boys and a full choir singing accompanied only by an unknown guy on pianoDennis Wilson - You are so Beautiful - same as the 'An American Band' footage if I'm not mistakenThe rest of the 'live' show is unexciting subpar to the Knebworth show of just a few years later in regards to performance quality and participation from Brian. The Akroyd/Belushi bits and sketches are all throwaway as far as I'm concerned.Dr. Landy was right.  At this time, Brian was not ready to be 'back' in the band which is well evident in his performances, state of mind and songwriting quality.For a high quality viewing experience search out the little seen 'The Beach Boys Video Hits' on DVD.  This footage includes all of their live TV performances dated roughly 1961-1965 with many live BB performances with very energetic Brian Wilson participation (Little St. Nick, When I Grow Up to Be a Man, Barbara Ann, Monkeys Uncle, etc.) It's no wonder everybody cried when Bri told them he would no longer tour.  It was a different band before 1965...I've always felt that when the boys got back together to do Nashville Sounds, they should have been finishing SMiLE instead.  This would have given them the chance to maturely demonstrate to the world the talent, spirit and harmony that is 'The Beach Boys'.",3,"Like it or not, Dr. Eugene Landy was right.....",1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,1893,"['Finally', 'got', 'buying', 'title', 'First', 'foremost', 'looking', 'live', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'stage', 'action', 'circa', '1976', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'songs', 'onstage', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'cut', 'few', 'times', 'piano', 'saw', 'footage', 'bass', 'either.Instead', 'value', 'DVD', 'held', 'mostly', 'studio', 'performances', ""'m"", 'Bugged', 'Old', 'Man', 'Bri', 'Dennis', 'Carl', 'piano', 'Notice', 'looking', 'other', 'laughing', 'lyrics', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'happenings', 'Wilson', 'Same', 'Song', 'Live', 'baptist', 'church', 'boys', 'full', 'choir', 'singing', 'accompanied', 'only', 'unknown', 'guy', 'pianoDennis', 'Wilson', 'are', 'so', 'Beautiful', 'same', ""'An"", 'American', 'Band', 'footage', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistakenThe', 'rest', ""'live"", 'show', 'unexciting', 'subpar', 'Knebworth', 'show', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'regards', 'performance', 'quality', 'participation', 'Brian', 'Akroyd/Belushi', 'bits', 'sketches', 'are', 'throwaway', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned.Dr', 'Landy', 'was', 'right', 'time', 'Brian', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'be', ""'back"", 'band', 'well', 'evident', 'performances', 'state', 'mind', 'songwriting', 'quality.For', 'high', 'quality', 'viewing', 'experience', 'search', 'little', 'seen', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Video', 'Hits', 'DVD', 'footage', 'live', 'TV', 'performances', 'dated', 'roughly', '1961-1965', 'many', 'live', 'BB', 'performances', 'very', 'energetic', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'participation', 'Little', 'St.', 'Nick', 'When', 'Grow', 'Up', 'Be', 'Man', 'Barbara', 'Ann', 'Monkeys', 'Uncle', 'etc', 'wonder', 'everybody', 'cried', 'when', 'Bri', 'told', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'tour', 'was', 'different', 'band', '1965', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'when', 'boys', 'got', 'back', 'together', 'do', 'Nashville', 'Sounds', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'finishing', 'SMiLE', 'instead', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'chance', 'maturely', 'demonstrate', 'world', 'talent', 'spirit', 'harmony', ""'The"", 'Beach', 'Boys']",N/A
