Also how the big dude always ate gross things like mayo straight out of a jar and ketchup & mustard on cerial but there was no milk available,and the trasvetite.

703955,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B0000687BQ,Serene Night,"[2, 4]","Okay, every so often, I'm in the mood for a silly comedy;  I rented ""Chat Room"" with that idea in mind... Well, I'm sorry to say, I was DEAD wrong. Chat Room stank. Not only did it stink, it was downright unfunny and gross in certain points.Chat Room, is the story of three losers, who are looking to find dates to their ten-year High School reunion in order to win a bet with another another classmate . Our three 'heroes' (who themselves aren't great prizes) start going to the Afro-Chat, chat room on the internet and begin dating women at random.  As you can imagine, things don't turn out too well.  Dates range from a transvestite man to a woman who stores her own lipo-sectioned fat in a jar on the mantel in the living room. (No I'm NOT Kidding!).The acting is poor at best, and makes fun of obese people, homosexuals, transvestites, the elderly, and mentally ill. Worse still, none of the humor was funny, but sophomoric in style. I particularly hated the way that the heroes heavy side-kick always ate gross things: cereal with ketchup for instance, mayonnaise from a jar... Instead of being funny, this was sad, pathetic and degrading. Feh.The poor acting, gross-out humor and the way the heroes were rewarded for being superficial killed this movie for me.
