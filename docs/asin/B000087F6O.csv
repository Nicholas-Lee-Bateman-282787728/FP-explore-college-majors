Smith,"[1, 1]","The maker here claims the LAPD's rogue cops, moonlighting as Death Row Records security, helped kill Tupac because he was demanding $10m from Suge Knight, who commanded his dirty cop friends to shoot Tupac and make it look like an East Coast/West Coast rap feud. Biggie had to be killed a few months later to maintain the fiction. It may well be true. However, nowhere do we see the LAPD responding, nor any responsible attorney or any legitimate media, such as the LA Times, which got into trouble over this case. Still, it's an enjoyable entertainment, even if the filmmaker's ethics and medthods and editing are questionable. It doesn't really answer who killed either rapper.

While there is some mention of Biggie, most of the film is dedicated to the murder investigations.While the ""truth"" behind what really happened should obviously be the focus of this film, I felt that a lot more should have been done with telling the audience the backstory. There is little to no mention of the actual feud that these two had. If you don't know anything about Death Row or the artists in the title then you may have trouble following the film. Most of the facts are presented poorly and some of the information like the reports of Snoop being scared for his life are poorly-researched, one-sided, and very much opinionated.As a huge fan of this entire story, I was bored to death and those who would like a more professional-looking account of the events may want to check out the VH-1 ""Behind The Music"" on The Notorious B.I.G.",2,Rent It!,1056844800,"06 29, 2003",2003,947,"['expecting', 'type', 'insight', 'lives', 'careers', 'Shakur', 'Biggie', 'should', 'probably', 'avoid', 'mention', 'Biggie', 'most', 'film', 'dedicated', 'murder', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'should', 'obviously', 'be', 'focus', 'film', 'felt', 'lot', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'telling', 'audience', 'backstory', 'little', 'mention', 'actual', 'feud', 'two', 'had', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Death', 'Row', 'artists', 'title', 'then', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'following', 'film', 'Most', 'facts', 'are', 'presented', 'poorly', 'information', 'reports', 'Snoop', 'being', 'scared', 'life', 'are', 'poorly-researched', 'one-sided', 'very', 'much', 'huge', 'fan', 'entire', 'story', 'was', 'bored', 'death', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'more', 'professional-looking', 'account', 'events', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'VH-1', 'Music', 'Notorious', 'B.I.G']",Biggie & Tupac: The Story Behind the Murder of Rap's Biggest Superstars - Remastered

734833,A1FS9R0JXHLHEG,B000087F6O,George Annessa,"[2, 2]","Your enjoyment of Biggie and Tupac is directly related to your enjoyment of director Nick Broomfield and his bumbling passive-aggressive approach to ambush journalism. He dominates the movie, integrating himself into the story in his search to uncover the culprits behind the slaying of the Notorious BIG and Tupac Shakur, two of hip hop's brightest stars, gunned down within months of one another. Six years after the murders no arrests have been made, and while Broomfield offers some possible suspects, he stops short of any definitive conclusion.He suggests several motives for the killings, but the point of the film is to chronicle his investigation - to present the facts and open a new dialogue about the culture of violence that is prevalent in hip hop - rather than pointing the finger at one guilty party. I find Broomfield's approach highly entertaining, and while he veers off course occasionally - there is a long pointless sequence with an ex-girlfriend of two LAPD officers allegedly tied to Tupac's murder that hinges on the sex lives of the officers, not their criminal behaviour - you have to admire his bravado in chasing down interviews in backrooms, prison yards, anywhere the story takes him. Yet there is a shocking interview with the 'Book Keeper', in his jail cell, possibly spelling out the man behind the slaying of Biggie Smalls.In the film's final third there is an interview with Suge Knight, head honcho at Death Row Records, a leading rap label. Knight was in prison at the time, and didn't want to do the interview, but through sheer persistence Broomfield got him on camera. You can sense the tension in the sequence. The camera is noticeable jittery, as though the camera operator was have an anxiety attack while shooting, and Broomfield is unusually subdued. Knight begins benignly enough with a `message for the kids' which slowly disintegrates into a hate filled diatribe and death threat against rap artist Snoop Dogg. It is powerful footage, and worth the price of admission.",5,A Great Insight Into The Murders Of Hip Hops Biggest Stars.,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,2017,"['enjoyment', 'Biggie', 'Tupac', 'directly', 'related', 'enjoyment', 'director', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'bumbling', 'passive-aggressive', 'approach', 'ambush', 'journalism', 'movie', 'integrating', 'story', 'search', 'uncover', 'culprits', 'slaying', 'Notorious', 'BIG', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'two', 'hip', 'hop', 'brightest', 'stars', 'gunned', 'down', 'months', 'one', 'Six', 'years', 'murders', 'arrests', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Broomfield', 'possible', 'suspects', 'short', 'definitive', 'conclusion.He', 'several', 'motives', 'killings', 'point', 'film', 'chronicle', 'investigation', 'present', 'facts', 'open', 'new', 'dialogue', 'culture', 'violence', 'prevalent', 'hip', 'hop', 'rather', 'pointing', 'finger', 'one', 'guilty', 'party', 'find', 'Broomfield', 'approach', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'course', 'occasionally', 'long', 'pointless', 'sequence', 'ex-girlfriend', 'two', 'LAPD', 'officers', 'allegedly', 'tied', 'Tupac', 'murder', 'sex', 'lives', 'officers', 'not', 'criminal', 'behaviour', 'have', 'admire', 'bravado', 'chasing', 'down', 'interviews', 'backrooms', 'prison', 'yards', 'anywhere', 'story', 'shocking', 'interview', ""'Book"", 'Keeper', 'jail', 'cell', 'possibly', 'spelling', 'out', 'man', 'slaying', 'Biggie', 'Smalls.In', 'film', 'final', 'third', 'interview', 'Suge', 'Knight', 'head', 'honcho', 'Death', 'Row', 'Records', 'leading', 'rap', 'label', 'Knight', 'was', 'prison', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'interview', 'sheer', 'persistence', 'Broomfield', 'got', 'camera', 'can', 'sense', 'tension', 'sequence', 'camera', 'noticeable', 'jittery', 'camera', 'operator', 'was', 'have', 'anxiety', 'attack', 'shooting', 'Broomfield', 'unusually', 'subdued', 'Knight', 'benignly', 'enough', 'message', 'kids', 'slowly', 'hate', 'filled', 'diatribe', 'death', 'threat', 'rap', 'artist', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'powerful', 'footage', 'price', 'admission']",Biggie & Tupac: The Story Behind the Murder of Rap's Biggest Superstars - Remastered
734834,APEOO1ATR5VHB,B000087F6O,"Hype Currie ""scholar of pop culture""","[5, 5]","This is a documentary about Tupac Shakur (2Pac) and Christopher Wallace (Notorious BIG), who were popular rap music stars in the 1990's, but they were both murdered in their mid-20's barely 6 months apart from each other.  Both crimes have never been solved, and British documentarian Nick Broomfield attempts to patch together some possible answers, involving various people either connected to the two artists or to the murder investigation.Pros:Broomfield reveals his own shortcomings and fears along the way, debunking the ""fearless journalist"" image that many in today's news culture like to promote.  He apparently accepts an off-camera scolding from Voletta Wallace early on (his narration mentions it), when word comes back to her on his unannounced visits to  some of Biggie (Wallace)'s old Brooklyn hang out spots.Some standout interviews include:Biggie's mother, Voletta Wallace.  She is very passionate and forthcoming in assessing the things that went right and went wrong in her son's life.The high school teacher who Tupac allegedly considered a foster father of sorts; he claims that Tupac had the range to do Shakespeare, having gone to school at a Performing Arts academy.Tupac's real father is interviewed, and looks like him; the footage is relatively short, concerning him, however-- especially since Afeni is not interviewed.The ex-cops who were associated with Tupac, or LAPD, who offer lots of interesting views from their perspective on what happened..shortly after Tupac's death, A bookkeeper who claims that he was paid money to arrange the murder of Biggie Smalls.A former bodyguard of Biggie who ID's the alleged gunman who shot at Biggie the night he died.. the alleged party, known by name, has to date, never been charged.Cons:No involvement from Tupac's mother, Afeni Shakur.  Given that the Afeni-supported ""Tupac: Resurrection"" movie (MTV Films) came only a few years later, it is unknown whether she was in negotiations to start that project at the time that Mr. Broomfield began his work, or if she simply just wasn't interested in him for other reasons.The interview with Suge Knight isn't very revelatory about the murder incident, but given Suge is an incarcerated felon and his history of gangster ethics, it was doubtful he'd set himself up to be labeled as a ""snitch"" over Tupac's death, whether he was involved or not.No interviews are seen with anyone representing the LAPD. You have testimony from former officers, but none from LAPD officials themselves.  it is unknown if Broomfield attempted to interview anyone from the LAPD.*************Assessment:  Broomfield comes away with the conclusion that parties at Death Row Records were involved with the deaths of both Tupac and Biggie;  accomplices would be parties at the Los Angeles Police Department, cops who moonlighted as ""security"" for the label who were allegedly crooked and  involved with drug trafficking.Bonus footage includes interviews that didn't make the main film, discographies for both artists, an interview with the filmmaker, and information about the Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation.",4,Very Good Documentary on Biggie & Tupac,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,3110,"['documentary', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', '2Pac', 'Christopher', 'Wallace', 'Notorious', 'BIG', 'who', 'were', 'popular', 'rap', 'music', 'stars', '1990', 'were', 'murdered', 'mid-20', 'barely', '6', 'months', 'apart', 'other', 'crimes', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'solved', 'British', 'documentarian', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'patch', 'together', 'possible', 'answers', 'involving', 'various', 'people', 'either', 'connected', 'two', 'artists', 'murder', 'investigation.Pros', 'Broomfield', 'own', 'shortcomings', 'fears', 'way', 'debunking', 'fearless', 'journalist', 'image', 'many', 'today', 'news', 'culture', 'promote', 'apparently', 'off-camera', 'scolding', 'Voletta', 'Wallace', 'early', 'narration', 'mentions', 'when', 'word', 'back', 'unannounced', 'visits', 'Biggie', 'Wallace', 'old', 'Brooklyn', 'hang', 'out', 'spots.Some', 'standout', 'interviews', 'include', 'Biggie', 'mother', 'Voletta', 'Wallace', 'very', 'passionate', 'forthcoming', 'assessing', 'things', 'went', 'right', 'went', 'wrong', 'son', 'life.The', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'allegedly', 'considered', 'foster', 'father', 'sorts', 'Tupac', 'had', 'range', 'do', 'Shakespeare', 'having', 'gone', 'school', 'Performing', 'Arts', 'academy.Tupac', 'real', 'father', 'interviewed', 'footage', 'relatively', 'short', 'concerning', 'however', 'especially', 'Afeni', 'not', 'interviewed.The', 'ex-cops', 'who', 'were', 'associated', 'Tupac', 'LAPD', 'who', 'offer', 'lots', 'interesting', 'views', 'perspective', 'what', 'happened..shortly', 'Tupac', 'death', 'A', 'bookkeeper', 'who', 'was', 'paid', 'money', 'arrange', 'murder', 'Biggie', 'Smalls.A', 'former', 'bodyguard', 'Biggie', 'who', 'ID', 'alleged', 'gunman', 'who', 'shot', 'Biggie', 'night', 'alleged', 'party', 'known', 'name', 'date', 'never', 'been', 'charged.Cons', 'involvement', 'Tupac', 'mother', 'Afeni', 'Shakur', 'Given', 'Afeni-supported', 'Tupac', 'Resurrection', 'movie', 'MTV', 'Films', 'came', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'unknown', 'was', 'negotiations', 'start', 'project', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Broomfield', 'began', 'work', 'simply', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'other', 'reasons.The', 'interview', 'Suge', 'Knight', ""n't"", 'very', 'revelatory', 'murder', 'incident', 'given', 'Suge', 'incarcerated', 'felon', 'history', 'gangster', 'ethics', 'was', 'doubtful', ""'d"", 'set', 'up', 'be', 'labeled', 'snitch', 'Tupac', 'death', 'was', 'involved', 'not.No', 'interviews', 'are', 'seen', 'anyone', 'representing', 'LAPD', 'have', 'testimony', 'former', 'officers', 'none', 'LAPD', 'officials', 'unknown', 'Broomfield', 'attempted', 'interview', 'anyone', 'LAPD', '*************Assessment', 'Broomfield', 'away', 'conclusion', 'parties', 'Death', 'Row', 'Records', 'were', 'involved', 'deaths', 'Tupac', 'Biggie', 'accomplices', 'would', 'be', 'parties', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Police', 'Department', 'cops', 'who', 'moonlighted', 'security', 'label', 'who', 'were', 'allegedly', 'crooked', 'involved', 'drug', 'trafficking.Bonus', 'footage', 'interviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'main', 'film', 'discographies', 'artists', 'interview', 'filmmaker', 'information', 'Christopher', 'Wallace', 'Memorial', 'Foundation']",Biggie & Tupac: The Story Behind the Murder of Rap's Biggest Superstars - Remastered

734838,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B000087F6O,Robert Blake,"[7, 7]","Perhaps no murders in the music culture from the last decade have caused so much fascination and debate as those of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls. The killings of these two rap stars remain important footnotes in the debate about the influence of rap music and the relevance of rap in today's popular culture. Nick Broomfield's latest film, &quot;Biggie And Tupac,&quot; is both an exploration of the gangsta rap underworld and a fascinating search for answers and testimony involving the murders. As was the case with Broomfield's previous icon murder mystery, &quot;Kurt &amp; Courtney&quot; which tried to find a link between Courtney Love and the suicide between her rock star husband, Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, &quot;Biggie And Tupac&quot; doesn't solve the case or even come to a solid conclusion. Instead it presents us with a gallery of both corrupt and truth searching characters and lots of questions, many valid. Fans of Broomfield know he will stop at nothing to at least get a few comments, the man will try everything from sneaking mikes to chasing down reluctant sources to get some form of information. The stakes here are higher because the people Broomfield is investigating are not angry Punk rockers or disgruntled former friends but people linked to dangerous California gang circles, corrupt policemen and a record label boss who fashions himself as a modern day Al Capone. What we get out of the film is that Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls started off as good friends and as soon as they found real success with their craft other forces such as Suge Knight began to influence events with a negative air due to money and rivalries with figures such as Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs. The main theory here is that Knight had connections with corrupt L.A. P.D. officers who worked for Death Row records on the side and planned BOTH executions and then blame them on the East Coast vs. West Coast &quot;rap wars.&quot; It may sound like a wild idea, but look at the evidence and people Broomfield uncovers and it becomes more valid. And here Broomfield has more material to use. &quot;Kurt &amp; Courtney&quot; was plagued by Courtney Love's restriction of Broomfield using footage and music, and eventhough Shakur's mother doesn't let him use songs, Broomfield uses interviews, early performance footage and photographs to describe the rise of Biggie and Tupac and point out those who were present and witnessed important events. It's a suspenseful ride at times, playing like a real life murder mystery. We learn a great deal about the gang world of California where being a &quot;snitch&quot; is a death sentence and Broomfield gives a tour of the excessive, edgy world of rap music. Bodygaurds and ex-cops are interviewed, all telling what they saw and we realize that indeed these are two murders surrounded by such strange stories, eyewitness accounts and corruption that there is no way these were random killings. And Broomfield does it with gusto and style, never relenting and even going for the big fish when he gets access into a prison facility to face Suge Knight in person. &quot;Biggie &amp; Tupac&quot; is the kind of documentary those who don't even care for rap can enjoy because it is more about the mysteries surrounding the two stars' murders, it plays like a dark detective story that still hasn't found an answer.

734840,A9C375HSNCY9,B000087F6O,Trevor Cotton,"[0, 0]","I've always been interested in the theories of Tupac's death, so decided to buy this documentary.  This obviously deals entirely with the theory that Suge Knight arranged the hit, and then also Biggie's death, to make it look like retaliation.  The problem with this theory is that i wasn't buying it before and after watching this im still not.  It goes something like this, Suge suspected that Pac was possibly trying to get out of Death Row, he realised that if he killed him, he would have access to all his music, which amounted to hundreds of tracks.  Also he would probably make more money from him if dead, as he would have become sort of a martyr.  Up to this point it is believable, what isn't are the circumstances of his death.  If Suge wanted Pac dead, why would he have a car pull up alongside and fire across the car right where he was also sitting (he also received a minor flesh wound), there would have been better ways to arrange this.  Nick Broomfield fails to answer this, and i still can't really beleive Suge Knight planned it.  It is much more likely that Orlando Anderson (the guy beaten up at the MGM beforehand) was behind the killing, or even that Biggie himself arranged the hit with the Crips that carried it out (though im not really buying that one either).  Overall this documentary was interesting and worth watching, but it failed to provide anything more than speculation, and no answers.",3,Did Suge Do It?,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,1424,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'theories', 'Tupac', 'death', 'so', 'decided', 'buy', 'documentary', 'obviously', 'deals', 'entirely', 'theory', 'Suge', 'Knight', 'arranged', 'hit', 'then', 'also', 'Biggie', 'death', 'make', 'look', 'retaliation', 'problem', 'theory', 'i', 'was', ""n't"", 'buying', 'watching', 'im', 'still', 'not', 'something', 'Suge', 'suspected', 'Pac', 'was', 'possibly', 'trying', 'get', 'Death', 'Row', 'realised', 'killed', 'would', 'have', 'access', 'music', 'amounted', 'hundreds', 'tracks', 'Also', 'would', 'probably', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'dead', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'sort', 'martyr', 'Up', 'point', 'believable', 'what', ""n't"", 'are', 'circumstances', 'death', 'Suge', 'wanted', 'Pac', 'dead', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'car', 'pull', 'alongside', 'fire', 'car', 'right', 'where', 'was', 'also', 'sitting', 'also', 'received', 'minor', 'flesh', 'wound', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'ways', 'arrange', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'answer', 'i', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'beleive', 'Suge', 'Knight', 'planned', 'much', 'more', 'likely', 'Orlando', 'Anderson', 'guy', 'beaten', 'up', 'MGM', 'beforehand', 'was', 'killing', 'even', 'Biggie', 'arranged', 'hit', 'Crips', 'carried', 'out', 'im', 'not', 'really', 'buying', 'one', 'documentary', 'was', 'interesting', 'worth', 'watching', 'failed', 'provide', 'anything', 'more', 'speculation', 'answers']",Biggie & Tupac: The Story Behind the Murder of Rap's Biggest Superstars - Remastered
