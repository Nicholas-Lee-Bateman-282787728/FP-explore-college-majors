499952,A1QDQT0ZAAZHQS,B00000FBH2,BookMania,"[11, 13]","The second season of Oz continues where the first left off.  It has now been several months since the riot in Emerald City that killed seven inmates and two prison guards, and the first episode commences as prisoners move back into their cells after it has been repaired and things in Oswald State Prison have calmed down.  Governor Devlin forms a committee to undertake the task of figuring out how the riot got started and who, if anyone, should be charged in connection to all that transpired during the ordeal.  The committee finds that nobody is to blame for the riot, and therefore, no one is to be charged with any crime.That's just the beginning of the season.  The rest of the season shows how certain characters change as they acclimate themselves to prison life.  Tobias Beecher (played by Lee Tergensen) undergoes the most notable change.  He came to prison as a clean-cut lawyer who knew nothing of street life, and we now see him develop into a hardened convict.  He is no longer the victim of aggression, and now assumes the role of aggressor.  He wants revenge for all that Vernon Schillinger (J.K. Simmons) put him through, and he goes about getting revenge in several different ways.  Also, in an interesting turn of events, the death of his wife has caused Beecher to develop certain homosexual tendencies.There are many characters in Oz, and it isn't possible for me to describe what they all go through during this second season, but I will say that you'll be glued to your television once you start watching.  This show is extremely engaging, and time seems to fly when I watch an episode of Oz.

Former lawyer turned drug raddled convict Tobias Beecher (Lee Tergesen) gets a new cell mate with the deranged Chris Keller (Law & Order: SVU's Christopher Meloni); which results into a savage and bizarre love affair with dire consequences.  Alvarez (the underrated Kirk Acevedo) finds himself ousted by new Latino leader El Cid (Luis Guzman), and it's safe to say that warden Leo Glynn (Ernie Hudson) ends up having his hands full.  Created by Homicide: Life on the Street creator Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson; the second season of Oz also introduced some pivotal characters to the cast.  Along with the addition of Keller, we are introduced to Ryan O'Reilly's (Dean Winters) mentally ill brother Cyril (Scott William Winters), Italian enforcer Chucky (Chuck Zito), and biker/killer Jaz Hoyt (Biohazard vocalist Evan Seinfeld); all of whom ended up staying on the show until it's end.  The performances are great, from Acevedo, to Tergesen, to Simmons, to Meloni, to the Winters brothers, to Harold Perrineau (as the wheelchair bound narrator Augustus Hill); as more character driven storyarcs are introduced.  The second season of Oz, although not as great as the first season, is still one of the best and most underrated shows in the history of HBO, and it's still definitely not for the faint of heart.",5,Excellent,1095724800,"09 21, 2004",2004,1663,"['season', 'two', 'HBO', 'Oz', 'prison', 'reformer', 'Tim', 'McManus', 'Terry', 'Kinney', 'experimental', 'unit', 'Emerald', 'City', 'wake', 'season', 'one', 'climaxing', 'prison', 'riot', 'drug', 'wars', 'blacks', 'italians', 'escalate', 'Aryan', 'Brotherhood', 'led', 'Schillinger', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'attempt', 're-establish', 'dominance', 'Former', 'lawyer', 'turned', 'drug', 'raddled', 'convict', 'Tobias', 'Beecher', 'Lee', 'Tergesen', 'new', 'cell', 'mate', 'deranged', 'Chris', 'Keller', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'results', 'savage', 'bizarre', 'love', 'affair', 'dire', 'consequences', 'Alvarez', 'underrated', 'Kirk', 'Acevedo', 'ousted', 'new', 'Latino', 'leader', 'El', 'Cid', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'safe', 'say', 'warden', 'Leo', 'Glynn', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'up', 'having', 'hands', 'full', 'Created', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'creator', 'Tom', 'Fontana', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'second', 'season', 'Oz', 'also', 'introduced', 'pivotal', 'characters', 'cast', 'addition', 'Keller', 'are', 'introduced', 'Ryan', ""O'Reilly"", 'Dean', 'Winters', 'mentally', 'ill', 'brother', 'Cyril', 'Scott', 'William', 'Winters', 'Italian', 'enforcer', 'Chucky', 'Chuck', 'Zito', 'biker/killer', 'Jaz', 'Hoyt', 'Biohazard', 'vocalist', 'Evan', 'Seinfeld', 'whom', 'ended', 'up', 'staying', 'show', 'end', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'Acevedo', 'Tergesen', 'Simmons', 'Meloni', 'Winters', 'brothers', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'wheelchair', 'narrator', 'Augustus', 'Hill', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'storyarcs', 'are', 'introduced', 'second', 'season', 'Oz', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'first', 'season', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'underrated', 'shows', 'history', 'HBO', 'still', 'definitely', 'not', 'faint', 'heart']",N/A

Which brings us to the second season of ""Oz"" on DVD.  After a brutal and bloody prison riot, things seem to be returning to normal in Oz (short for Oswald Penitentary).  The only thing is, normal in Oz involves death, drugs, despair, and ultimately, destruction.  With allegiances being tested, torn and changed at the drop of a hat, survival for the inmates of Emerald City isn't an option... it's a necessity.  Boasting solid performances from a great ensemble cast, and often shocking moments of violence and drama, this is one of those shows that definitely is not for everyone.  With the show coming to an end on HBO, it's great to revisit that network's first great drama (sorry, but ""The Sopranos"" came AFTER this show)as it starts to become better with every episode.",5,"Return To ""Oz""",1042675200,"01 16, 2003",2003,872,"['truly', 'apocalyptic', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'left', 'left', 'wondering', 'Well', 'now', 'what', 'second', 'season', 'Oz', 'DVD', 'brutal', 'bloody', 'prison', 'riot', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'returning', 'normal', 'Oz', 'short', 'Oswald', 'Penitentary', 'only', 'thing', 'normal', 'Oz', 'death', 'drugs', 'despair', 'ultimately', 'destruction', 'allegiances', 'being', 'tested', 'torn', 'changed', 'drop', 'hat', 'survival', 'inmates', 'Emerald', 'City', ""n't"", 'option', 'necessity', 'Boasting', 'solid', 'performances', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'often', 'shocking', 'moments', 'violence', 'drama', 'one', 'shows', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'show', 'coming', 'end', 'HBO', 'great', 'revisit', 'network', 'first', 'great', 'drama', 'sorry', 'Sopranos', 'came', 'AFTER', 'show', 'become', 'better', 'episode']",N/A
499986,AGSWTH7SP2256,B00000FBH2,R. W. Rasband,"[45, 46]","At first glance, Tom Fontana's extraordinary television series ""Oz"" seems to be a hyper-naturalistic view of the hellish life behind bars in American prisons.  It is that, of course.  But the title is a tip-off that Fontana also has larger, more mythic concerns on his mind.  His tortured Catholicism plays a role in the world-view presented here, as it did in his wonderful earlier series ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" and ""St. Elsewhere.""  It turns out that Oz (the prison) is a kind of purgatory where wounded spirits struggle with good and evil.  Even the best (like administators Tim McManus and Leo Glynn) are highly fallible, even misguided and foolish at times.  And even the worst prisoners have sparks of humanity in them.  These worst include the amazingly terrifying Simon Adebisi, the larger-than-life Nigerian criminal who controls the heroin trade in Oz.  And J.K. Simmons deserves some kind of special award for his portrayal of Vern Schillinger, the leader of the neo-Nazi prisoners.  He is the worst human being imaginable, but Simmons plays him with such style and elan that you have to grant the devil his due.  As the recappers on ""Television Without Pity"" put it, if ""Oz"" were more well known, Schillinger would join Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates in the Fictional Villains Hall of Fame.The battle for the souls of these men is best shown in the ordeal of Tobias Beecher, an upper-class lawyer who is convicted of a drunk-driving homicide and finds himself in the middle of this inferno.  His horrible experiences in Oz reach a Job-like intensity.  The second season sees the arrival of actor Christopher Meloni as the sociopathic Chris Keller.  The three-way tango of betrayal between Keller, Beecher, and Schillinger is absolutely chilling.  The storytelling of ""Oz"" is intricate, densely layered, and paced like a rocket taking off.  If you miss five minutes of a single episode you may miss the fate of a character's entire life being sealed.  There is a heightened, almost magic realism to much of what goes on.  (In the land of Oz, it only takes a few weeks from a death sentenced being pronounced until its execution; and each episode is narrated by inmate Augustus Hill inside some kind of omni-aware, postmodern space.)  This can be a little disconcerting at first, but the final impact is exhilarating.  If you can take the intense (but never gratuitous) violence and the hair-raising prison sex, ""Oz"" is a wild ride from one of the best writers working in television.",5,Fontana's Mythic Vision,1074643200,"01 21, 2004",2004,2503,"['first', 'glance', 'Tom', 'Fontana', 'extraordinary', 'television', 'series', 'Oz', 'be', 'hyper-naturalistic', 'view', 'hellish', 'life', 'bars', 'American', 'prisons', 'course', 'title', 'tip-off', 'Fontana', 'also', 'larger', 'more', 'mythic', 'concerns', 'mind', 'tortured', 'Catholicism', 'role', 'world-view', 'presented', 'here', 'did', 'wonderful', 'earlier', 'series', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'out', 'Oz', 'prison', 'kind', 'purgatory', 'where', 'wounded', 'spirits', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'Even', 'best', 'administators', 'Tim', 'McManus', 'Leo', 'Glynn', 'are', 'highly', 'fallible', 'even', 'misguided', 'foolish', 'times', 'even', 'worst', 'prisoners', 'have', 'sparks', 'humanity', 'worst', 'include', 'amazingly', 'terrifying', 'Simon', 'Adebisi', 'larger-than-life', 'Nigerian', 'criminal', 'who', 'heroin', 'trade', 'Oz', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'kind', 'special', 'award', 'portrayal', 'Vern', 'Schillinger', 'leader', 'neo-Nazi', 'prisoners', 'worst', 'human', 'being', 'imaginable', 'Simmons', 'such', 'style', 'elan', 'have', 'grant', 'devil', 'due', 'recappers', 'Television', 'Pity', 'put', 'Oz', 'were', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'Schillinger', 'would', 'join', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'Fictional', 'Villains', 'Hall', 'Fame.The', 'battle', 'souls', 'men', 'best', 'shown', 'ordeal', 'Tobias', 'Beecher', 'upper-class', 'lawyer', 'who', 'convicted', 'drunk-driving', 'homicide', 'middle', 'inferno', 'horrible', 'experiences', 'Oz', 'reach', 'Job-like', 'intensity', 'second', 'season', 'arrival', 'actor', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'sociopathic', 'Chris', 'Keller', 'three-way', 'tango', 'betrayal', 'Keller', 'Beecher', 'Schillinger', 'absolutely', 'chilling', 'storytelling', 'Oz', 'intricate', 'densely', 'layered', 'paced', 'rocket', 'taking', 'off', 'miss', 'five', 'minutes', 'single', 'episode', 'may', 'miss', 'fate', 'character', 'entire', 'life', 'being', 'sealed', 'heightened', 'almost', 'magic', 'realism', 'much', 'what', 'land', 'Oz', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'death', 'sentenced', 'being', 'pronounced', 'execution', 'episode', 'narrated', 'inmate', 'Augustus', 'Hill', 'kind', 'omni-aware', 'postmodern', 'space', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'first', 'final', 'impact', 'exhilarating', 'can', 'take', 'intense', 'never', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'hair-raising', 'prison', 'sex', 'Oz', 'wild', 'ride', 'one', 'best', 'writers', 'working', 'television']",N/A

However, you will find plenty of folks with no heart!!!Season 2 finds the smoke clearing from the aftermath of the prison riots that ended Season 1.  Tension is high, but what else can you expect from Oz?  Oz is trying to recover from the riots, and Oz is being threatened with being shut down.  2 officers are killed, 6 prisoners are dead and 34 wounded.  Governor Devlin gets Alvah Case (Charles S. Dutton) to investigate what happened to lead to the riot.  Of course when it's all said and done, he will find no one is to blame.  The Governor is not happy about that one bit.  He is not happy unless he can make heads roll.  Inmates are suffering from drug withdrawals.  The mole will try to dig his way out of Oz.  Wangler can't read, and he thrives on being ignorant.  He hides his shame of his illiteracy by being tough.  The drug war between the blacks and Italians reach a fever pitch, while the Arians attempt to regain their dominance in Oz.  Beecher is introduced to his new cell mate Chris Keller (Christopher Meloni) in a love hate relationship that will leave your head spinning.  Ryan O'Reilly's finds himself caring and protecting for his mentally ill brother Cyril.McManus is hoping to make some changes to make Em City function better.  He creates 10 groups residing in Oz:  the Muslims, the gangsters, the Latinos, the Italians, the Irish, the Aryans, the Bikers, the Christians, the Gay, and Others. 4 members from each group will live in Oz, and one member of the 4 will represent it's respective group win weekly meetings so they can talk about what's going on in Oz.Oz continues with intricate story lines that will shock and keep you riveted to the screen.  Ryan O'Rielly finds out he has breast cancer. As manipulative as he is, you find yourself feeling sorry for him, then he does something that will make you upset for feeling sorry for him.  Glynn's daughter is raped, and someone in Oz knows who committed the crime.  Glynn is determined to find out who did it.  There was one line that narrator Hill says that is funny.  Hill has a cell mate his having major flatulence issues and he says ""Smelly farts are a sign of something seriously wrong on the inside.""Said is trying to help Hill get out of prison.  Poet Arnold Jackson gets his poetry published, and it can be his key to freedom.  Ryan hits on Gloria mistaking her care for his health for affection. This will continue a story line of obsession that is very creepy.  Shabetta and Adebesie can't stand one another.  Judge Grace Lima wanted to see Beecher, felt she gave him a bad sentence.  Keller is working with Schillinger being a spy, but he is developing real feelings for Beecher.  Female inmate Shirly Bellinger is an interesting character.  She is the only female inmate on death row at Oz.  She was sentenced to die for killing her daughter.  Arnold Jackson is granted parole, and vows he will not return to Oz.  He promises to make the most of his second chance.  It's later found out that Ryan had Cyril kill Gloria's husband, all in the name of love.  I felt the weakest Prisoner story line was Prisoner Jiggy Walker (LL Cool J).  Jiggy Walker links drugs to Governer Dublin, turns out he was lying.  His story line was a strange one being he only appeared on the show once.Some guy gets into Adebesi's head.  Ribido has a grandson who has leukemia and his grandson wishes to go to Disney World.  The inmates come through and help Ribido to raise the funds for the trip.  Alvarez cuts out the eyes of a CO in a horrid and shocking scene.  Poet returns to Oz disappointing [black muslem guy]. Some of CO's in the prison are as criminal as the inmates, even more so.  Ryan is always being manipulative.  Something he does best.  He will only donate blood if his brother is released from solitary.  If you disliked Adebesi in season 1 you will really find yourself disliking him more in season 2!!!  His role is a lot more prominent.  Luis Guzman is Prisoner Raul Hernandez.  When Hernandez arrives Alverez finds himself on the outside looking in.  He is willing to do whatever it takes to impress Hernandez so he can belong.  Peter Schibetta enters Oz and his main mission is to find out who murdered his father Nino.  Needless to say, Peter and Adebesi will be at odds with each other.One of the best performances to me is Beecher.  In season 1 he is a new prisoner, the lawyer who was sent to Oz for killing a young girl while under the influence of alcohol.  Season 2 you find Beecher much harder after having to deal with Vernon Schillinger.  He is sick and tired of being the victim and decides it's time to be the tormentor and sets about getting revenge against Schillinger anyway he can.  His wife dies, commits suicide leaving his children to be raised by his parents.  He is so despondent over her death, he starts drinking again.The Characters I like:  Hill, Beecher, Said (love him!!!!), McManus, Rebadow,  Sister Pete, Dr. Nathan, Poet, Arif to name a few, Alvarez (you end up feeling sorry for him).The Characters you will love to hate:  Schillinger, Adebisi, O'Reilly, Schibetta, Glynn (okay I'm on the fence, sometimes I love him, sometimes I hate him)New Characters:  Jiggy Walker, Nappa, Keller, Hoyt, Cyril, Busmalis, El Cid, Shirley Bellinger, Guerra, Pancamo, Kirk, Coushaine.I'm a fan of the show, so I enjoyed season 2 immensely.  If you own season 1, then season 2 is worth having.  To play the Deleted Scenes extras a play all feature would have been really nice.

However, the violence, nudity, and profanity are not gratuitous.  Within the context of this horribly believable prison context, the stories and their depiction make sense.  The dialogue is memorable and the acting superb.  There are some aspects of this series that stretch credulity but dramatic license entitles the producers to some willing suspension of disbelief, enough, in any event, to provoke insight and reflection.Caution:  The occasional male nudity and simulated sex, especially in seasons 3-4, will be offensive some viewers.
