We get a full cast of characters, each with his or her own story, and we get to know them. Authenticity was sought and achieved. It was a little slow getting started, I admit, but since it clocks in at 2.5 hours, so what? What's your hurry? It's a fine film and I enjoyed watching it.I'd also like to mention that it was made in 1987. Just in case you watch it. There's a little scene that may remind my American readers of Lorena Bobbitt.

More than that, it cements itself as a brilliant piece of cinema that contains some truly heartbreaking performances and themes so universal and relevant that one cannot help but be shaken to the core by the prose and execution.Young Pelle, only twelve years of age, flees Sweden with his elderly father in search of a better life.  Pelle's mother has died and his father is fond of the drink, and so the poverty that threatened them in Sweden is something they are trying to erase in Denmark.  Pelle's father, Lassefar, winds up getting work from a farm owner who is reluctant because of the ages of his new employees but concedes due to Lassefar's persistence.  Sadly, the job is a lot of Lassefar to handle and the rigid and harsh treatment from the surrounding individuals make life in general very hard for the pair of them, especially Pelle who is trying to fit in at school and handle his duties at work but is constantly tormented by neighboring bullies.  Lassefar is a man full of talk but little bite, and his cowardice shrouds his judgement and his actions.The growth shown in the film is remarkable and helps flesh out not only Pelle and his father but the supporting characters as well.  This is a tapestry film, filled with unique people who all play into Pelle's life and help him on his journey into adulthood.The production values are beautiful here.  The cinematography is exceptional, and the central performances by both von Sydow and young Pelle Hvenegaard are brilliant.  Max von Sydow received an Academy Award nomination for his role as the emotionally brittle father, and he truly deserved it (albeit it the wrong category).  He helps flesh out Pelle's story by providing an honest backdrop to his life, and that final scene, those tears, that confession, that reluctance, that heartbreak is almost too much to take.I loved this movie and I can't sing it's praises high enough.  A worthy winner of the Oscar and one of those well-rounded films that understands balance and delivers it in spades.",5,A towering achievement...,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,2245,"['haunting', 'look', 'lives', 'young', 'son', 'elder', 'father', 'embark', 'new', 'lives', 'native', 'Sweden', 'foreign', 'soil', 'Denmark', 'took', 'home', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'More', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'cinema', 'truly', 'heartbreaking', 'performances', 'themes', 'so', 'universal', 'relevant', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'shaken', 'core', 'prose', 'execution.Young', 'Pelle', 'only', 'twelve', 'years', 'age', 'flees', 'Sweden', 'elderly', 'father', 'search', 'better', 'life', 'Pelle', 'mother', 'died', 'father', 'fond', 'drink', 'so', 'poverty', 'threatened', 'Sweden', 'something', 'are', 'trying', 'erase', 'Denmark', 'Pelle', 'father', 'Lassefar', 'up', 'getting', 'work', 'farm', 'owner', 'who', 'reluctant', 'ages', 'new', 'employees', 'concedes', 'due', 'Lassefar', 'persistence', 'Sadly', 'job', 'lot', 'Lassefar', 'handle', 'rigid', 'harsh', 'treatment', 'surrounding', 'individuals', 'make', 'life', 'general', 'very', 'hard', 'pair', 'especially', 'Pelle', 'who', 'trying', 'fit', 'school', 'handle', 'duties', 'work', 'constantly', 'tormented', 'neighboring', 'bullies', 'Lassefar', 'man', 'full', 'talk', 'little', 'bite', 'cowardice', 'shrouds', 'judgement', 'actions.The', 'growth', 'shown', 'film', 'remarkable', 'flesh', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'Pelle', 'father', 'supporting', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'tapestry', 'film', 'filled', 'unique', 'people', 'who', 'play', 'Pelle', 'life', 'help', 'journey', 'adulthood.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'beautiful', 'here', 'cinematography', 'exceptional', 'central', 'performances', 'von', 'Sydow', 'young', 'Pelle', 'Hvenegaard', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'role', 'emotionally', 'brittle', 'father', 'truly', 'deserved', 'wrong', 'category', 'flesh', 'out', 'Pelle', 'story', 'providing', 'honest', 'backdrop', 'life', 'final', 'scene', 'tears', 'confession', 'reluctance', 'heartbreak', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'take.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'praises', 'high', 'enough', 'A', 'worthy', 'winner', 'Oscar', 'one', 'well-rounded', 'films', 'balance', 'delivers', 'spades']",N/A

Goldberg,"[1, 1]","All 36 reviewers -- even the gentleman who awarded only 1-star --  agree, and deservedly so,  that in its own right, this is an outstanding film at every level. Such arguments as have been generated relate only to how the DVD has been packaged. No extras, English language dubbing, subtitles that spell out each and every noise on the sound-track, and the absence of 22 minutes compared with the original Danish and European versions. As is so often the case, the 36 reviews seem to describe several different products, including even VHS versions, and Amazon lists at least two products with the same cover as the copy I purchased from them that is from Trinity Home Entertainment and dated 2006. It would have been nice to have had at least the option of seeing the restored footage, as well as some critical background to the literary origin of the movie and a synopsis of the 4-volume novel from which it is derived. But this is not a Criterion release, and is not priced as such. Everyone who buys it knows (or should know) what it provides and what it does not. The only genuine issue becomes how well does it present the actual movie that North American audiences actually saw in their cinemas? For my money, the only fair answer is ""pretty darn well"". Visually and acoustically, the quality is first rate. Generally, I hate dubbed films because everyone is made to speak with an American accent, but in this copy, more sensitivity has been employed; the accents all have a genuine Scandinavian inflexion and I did not experience a single moment of discomfort in that regard. True, the subtitles do announce the background noises for the hearing - impaired: at worst it was slightly amusing, but generally it did not cause me any irritation. Warts and all, this is a very satisfying presentation of a unique masterpiece, one of the very greatest from that part of our planet.",5,Rites of passage,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,1882,"['36', 'reviewers', 'even', 'gentleman', 'who', 'awarded', 'only', '1-star', 'agree', 'deservedly', 'so', 'own', 'right', 'outstanding', 'film', 'level', 'Such', 'arguments', 'have', 'been', 'generated', 'relate', 'only', 'how', 'DVD', 'been', 'packaged', 'extras', 'English', 'language', 'dubbing', 'spell', 'noise', 'sound-track', 'absence', '22', 'minutes', 'compared', 'original', 'Danish', 'European', 'versions', 'As', 'so', 'often', 'case', '36', 'reviews', 'seem', 'describe', 'several', 'different', 'products', 'including', 'even', 'VHS', 'versions', 'Amazon', 'lists', 'least', 'two', 'products', 'same', 'cover', 'copy', 'purchased', 'Trinity', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'dated', '2006', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'had', 'least', 'option', 'seeing', 'restored', 'footage', 'as', 'well', 'critical', 'background', 'literary', 'origin', 'movie', 'synopsis', '4-volume', 'novel', 'derived', 'not', 'Criterion', 'release', 'not', 'priced', 'such', 'Everyone', 'who', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'what', 'not', 'only', 'genuine', 'issue', 'how', 'well', 'present', 'actual', 'movie', 'North', 'American', 'audiences', 'actually', 'saw', 'cinemas', 'money', 'only', 'fair', 'answer', 'pretty', 'darn', 'well', 'Visually', 'acoustically', 'quality', 'first', 'rate', 'Generally', 'hate', 'dubbed', 'films', 'everyone', 'made', 'speak', 'American', 'accent', 'copy', 'more', 'sensitivity', 'been', 'employed', 'accents', 'have', 'genuine', 'Scandinavian', 'inflexion', 'did', 'not', 'experience', 'single', 'moment', 'discomfort', 'regard', 'True', 'subtitles', 'do', 'announce', 'background', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'worst', 'was', 'slightly', 'amusing', 'generally', 'did', 'not', 'cause', 'irritation', 'Warts', 'very', 'satisfying', 'presentation', 'unique', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'very', 'greatest', 'part', 'planet']",N/A

In the admirable winner of both the Palme d'Or at Cannes and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film, Max von Sydow (in his only Oscar nominated performance) is Lasse, a Swedish middle- aged widower who takes his young son Pelle from impoverished ninetieth century Sweden to Denmark in search and hope of finding a better life. Because of his age and lack of any specific job skills, Lasse is forced to become a laborer on a farm, with Pelle helping him out. You know, when my family and I first came to America in 1991, one of our new friends, himself a ""new American"" told us one thing that I always remember, ""No matter what, every immigrant is going to eat a lot of dirt, some - more, some- less"". Lasse and Pelle of Billie August's superb drama had been served plenty of that meal - they had to sleep in a former chicken coop, they are poor, Pelle is bullied by kids at the local school. Lasse meets a nice local woman whose husband has been lost at sea and wants to marry her but the husband returns... Lasse and his son will go through many of cruelties and indignities together but they always remain devoted to each other. Their relationship is not only of a son and his father but also of two loyal friends. In the end, Pelle has realized that the farm is no place for him, and I want to know what happens to him and to his father next - but there is no sequel for this involving, moving, and simply magnificent movie yet.",5,One of the best films about immigration and father - son relationship,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,1506,"['film', 'ever', 'sequel', 'Pelle', 'Conqueror', 'admirable', 'winner', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", 'Cannes', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'film', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'only', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Lasse', 'Swedish', 'middle-', 'aged', 'widower', 'who', 'young', 'son', 'Pelle', 'impoverished', 'ninetieth', 'century', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'search', 'hope', 'finding', 'better', 'life', 'age', 'lack', 'specific', 'job', 'skills', 'Lasse', 'forced', 'become', 'laborer', 'farm', 'Pelle', 'helping', 'out', 'know', 'when', 'family', 'first', 'came', 'America', '1991', 'one', 'new', 'friends', 'new', 'American', 'told', 'one', 'thing', 'always', 'remember', 'matter', 'what', 'immigrant', 'going', 'eat', 'lot', 'dirt', 'more', 'some-', 'less', 'Lasse', 'Pelle', 'Billie', 'August', 'superb', 'drama', 'had', 'been', 'served', 'plenty', 'meal', 'had', 'sleep', 'former', 'chicken', 'coop', 'are', 'poor', 'Pelle', 'bullied', 'kids', 'local', 'school', 'Lasse', 'nice', 'local', 'woman', 'husband', 'been', 'lost', 'sea', 'marry', 'husband', 'returns', 'Lasse', 'son', 'will', 'go', 'many', 'cruelties', 'indignities', 'together', 'always', 'remain', 'devoted', 'other', 'relationship', 'not', 'only', 'son', 'father', 'also', 'two', 'loyal', 'friends', 'end', 'Pelle', 'realized', 'farm', 'place', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'father', 'next', 'sequel', 'involving', 'moving', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'movie', 'yet']",N/A
558267,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00004Y6B5,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","PELLE THE CONQUEROR may now be twenty-three years old as a film but the power and beauty of this epic masterpiece from Denmark still retain the brilliance of its original 1987 theatrical release. Based on a four volume novel by Martin Andersen Nex the screenplay by writer/director Bille August, Per Olov Enquist, and Bjarne Reuter granted takes only a small portion of the original story and that explains why so much of what happens in this 2 1/2 hour film is only vaguely explained, but the end result is a marvelous drama of the relationship of a father (Lassefar, brilliantly realized by the venerable Max von Sydow), who has pride but has not the courage of his convictions, and a son (Pelle, a masterpiece of young acting by Pelle Hvenegaard) who dreams of finding a life better than the bitterly poor existence he shares with the father he loves. The film takes place in Denmark near the turn of the 19th century over the course of a year and during that time the Pelle encounters peer prejudice from being a Swedish immigrant who has traveled to Denmark for the good life, class distinction between the wealthy landowners and the poverty stricken workers, the double standard of morals of the learned 'role models', death, physical abuse, young love between two lovely people who out of fear drown their infant at birth, the harsh realities of gathering sustenance from laboring the land and the sea, the bonds of true friendship with a bastard child of the land owner, and the disappointment of losing hope of conquering the world by means of accompanying a friend who must remain a vassal for two years who becomes brain damaged in an alteration with the foreman. Yet through all of these lessons Pelle learns about the survival of the fittest and despite all odds being against him, strikes out toward the frozen sea to await his ship of fortune.This is a film about dreams and realities, about surviving physical and mental stresses, about adapting to the seasons and the struggles of indentured life. The stench of the farm and the grace of the snowfields are captured with amazing perfection by cinematographer J&ouml;rgen Persson and the mood of this film's story is accompanied by the music of Stefan Nilsson. The cast is huge and uniformly excellent, much due to the sensitive direction by Bille August. This is a classic film, one that is enjoyed more with repeated viewings. This is definitely one for the home library. Breathtaking.

Pelle did not fail me because it is an outstanding movie.  It's a sort of ""Giants in the Earth"" with a shorter emigration trip.  A man somewhat up in years travels from Sweden to Denmark with his young son (roughly 10-12 years old).  The goal is a better life than what they left behind in Sweden (along with their recently deceased wife/mother).  As the ship lands, many are hired right off the boat but there is little interest in the combination of two males; one too old and the other too young.  They eventually get a job but one in which neither employer nor employee got what they were looking for.Pelle is the young lad and it is through his perspective that most of the movie emerges and what a series of events we see.  There are many relationships, insults and injuries, deaths and drownings, love and hatred, joys and sorrows in this 2 1/2 hour movie.  Yet, with all that happens, it seems to move along very well.  The writer/director Bille August deserves great praise (and the Oscar) for weaving together a snapshot of life in this small community that Pelle and his father find themselves.  The character development and the humanity on display create a most compelling series of vignettes.  The final scene fortells the movies title in a way in which we can believe.
