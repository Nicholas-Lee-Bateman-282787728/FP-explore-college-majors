Sometimes when DVDs are made from a company outside of the top animators (Disney, Pixar...) the animation can be sketchy, but this DVD is decent.  The movie is about an evil Snow Queen who uses her power to freeze the world.  It is a great story line about the battle between good and evil, showing kids that being bad never wins at the end.  There was constant action, memorable characters, a story line adults and kids can appreciate and animation you can appreciate.  My kids and I have watched this DVD a few times already and I am sure we will watch this many more times!I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",5,Surprised Me,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,719,"['First', 'off', 'will', 'say', 'surprised', 'animation', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'DVDs', 'are', 'made', 'company', 'top', 'animators', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'animation', 'can', 'be', 'sketchy', 'DVD', 'decent', 'movie', 'evil', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'who', 'power', 'freeze', 'world', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'showing', 'kids', 'being', 'bad', 'never', 'end', 'was', 'constant', 'action', 'memorable', 'characters', 'story', 'line', 'adults', 'kids', 'can', 'appreciate', 'animation', 'can', 'appreciate', 'kids', 'have', 'watched', 'DVD', 'few', 'times', 'already', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'watch', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'received', 'DVD', 'review', 'exchange', 'sharing', 'honest', 'opinion']",The Snow Queen
1666589,A3PJQ4742VN84H,B00EC6VT8U,"Hope this helps ""help""","[7, 9]","It's nothing new when a major studio puts out a major theater film, tons of smaller companies try to make use of the hype through creations of similar works.  In this case, the obvious premier of Disney's &#34;Frozen&#34; has inspired many other films with a similar theme...this film being one of them.  Ironically, though it certainly does not come close to the &#34;Disney magic&#34;, it still manages to leave it's own mark and stand on it's own.CONTENT ISSUES:Really, there's not much to worry about for Parents and Guardians.  This is a kid's film and stay pretty clean.  However, two female minor characters do wear victorian style clothing with the characteristic lower neckline...so for some parents that may be an issue.  Also, one character either said, &#34;Darnit&#34; or &#34;D***&#34;.  I couldn't really tell the difference because of the way he said it.  But beyond that, no language issues.PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):Disney's Frozen is a more liberal take on Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale &#34;The Snow Queen&#34;.  This DVD movie is a closer adaptation to the original tale...but it still takes quite a bit of poetic license.  This has nothing to do with one being better than the other, just thought it should be noted.  But as to the actual plot, it's not bad.  It did feel rushed at times..especially in meeting with the king. And some of the dialogue was kind of cheesy.  Still, it had a believable flow. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great.  Still, it did succeed in areas and did have some powerful and hair-rasing portions...especially the last portions.CHARACTERS:The characters were generally shallow.  They weren't bad characters, but there was no major development (probably due to the more rushed nature of it).  The voice actors also did a good job, but not a great one...and the main protagonist, Gerda, had some moments where the actress's potential really shined and areas that were...not so much.  Still, they worked for the film and were still entertaining and I was not annoyed with any of them.VISUALS:Too often, in smaller &#34;copy&#34; productions, I've run into bad animation and effects.  However, this was a pleasant surprise.  The animators really put a lot of care into the work and details.  The movement was very smooth and believable.  Gravity affected the movements naturally.  The backdrops and settings carried natural tones...nothing overly eccentric.  The details on the characters' were very nice...and the overall designs were charming.  Even natural effects like snow fall, lake reflections, etc. were wonderfully constructed.  This showed that this company did take their work seriously...and perhaps even enjoyed it to some degree.MUSIC:The music was surprisingly powerful and really helped this film overcome it's shortcomings.  This is a rarity amongst many smaller productions...but I'm glad they were able to pull it off.  It did add to the narrative.SPECIAL FEATURES:None...it's just the movie.ALL IN ALL:No regrets in having this film, and I will keep it.  Though it certainly suffers from some weaknesses, it has a generally heartwarming story and manages to achieve memorable high points.  Even more important, it maintains a believable character of it's own.  It does not feel like it's trying to copy something else.  All in all, this will be a hit or miss for some people...but as for me, I really do appreciate the work put into it and am glad to have one more decent adaptation of Han's Christian Andersen's &#34;The Snow Queen&#34; available.",4,"Yes, some cheese...but still can stand on it's own two feet.",1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,3529,"['nothing', 'new', 'when', 'major', 'studio', 'out', 'major', 'theater', 'film', 'tons', 'smaller', 'companies', 'try', 'make', 'use', 'hype', 'creations', 'similar', 'works', 'case', 'obvious', 'premier', 'Disney', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'inspired', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'similar', 'theme', 'film', 'being', 'one', 'Ironically', 'certainly', 'not', 'come', 'close', '34', 'Disney', 'magic', '34', 'still', 'leave', 'own', 'mark', 'stand', 'own.CONTENT', 'ISSUES', 'Really', 'not', 'much', 'worry', 'Parents', 'Guardians', 'kid', 'film', 'stay', 'pretty', 'clean', 'However', 'two', 'female', 'minor', 'characters', 'do', 'wear', 'victorian', 'style', 'clothing', 'characteristic', 'lower', 'neckline', 'so', 'parents', 'may', 'be', 'issue', 'Also', 'one', 'character', 'said', '34', 'Darnit', '34', '34', 'D***', '34', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'difference', 'way', 'said', 'language', 'issues.PLOT', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'NO', 'SPOILERS', 'Disney', 'Frozen', 'more', 'liberal', 'take', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'fairytale', '34', 'Snow', 'Queen', '34', 'DVD', 'movie', 'closer', 'adaptation', 'original', 'tale', 'still', 'quite', 'bit', 'poetic', 'license', 'nothing', 'do', 'one', 'being', 'better', 'other', 'just', 'thought', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'actual', 'plot', 'not', 'bad', 'did', 'feel', 'rushed', 'times..especially', 'meeting', 'king', 'dialogue', 'was', 'kind', 'cheesy', 'Still', 'had', 'believable', 'flow', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'Still', 'did', 'succeed', 'areas', 'did', 'have', 'powerful', 'hair-rasing', 'portions', 'especially', 'last', 'portions.CHARACTERS', 'characters', 'were', 'generally', 'shallow', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'characters', 'was', 'major', 'development', 'probably', 'due', 'more', 'rushed', 'nature', 'voice', 'actors', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Gerda', 'had', 'moments', 'where', 'actress', 'potential', 'really', 'shined', 'areas', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Still', 'worked', 'film', 'were', 'still', 'entertaining', 'was', 'not', 'annoyed', 'them.VISUALS', 'Too', 'often', 'smaller', '34', 'copy', '34', 'productions', ""'ve"", 'run', 'bad', 'animation', 'effects', 'However', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'animators', 'really', 'put', 'lot', 'care', 'work', 'details', 'movement', 'was', 'very', 'smooth', 'believable', 'Gravity', 'affected', 'movements', 'naturally', 'backdrops', 'settings', 'carried', 'natural', 'tones', 'nothing', 'overly', 'eccentric', 'details', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'nice', 'overall', 'designs', 'were', 'charming', 'Even', 'natural', 'effects', 'snow', 'fall', 'lake', 'reflections', 'etc', 'were', 'wonderfully', 'constructed', 'showed', 'company', 'did', 'take', 'work', 'seriously', 'perhaps', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'degree.MUSIC', 'music', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'powerful', 'really', 'helped', 'film', 'overcome', 'shortcomings', 'rarity', 'amongst', 'many', 'smaller', 'productions', ""'m"", 'glad', 'were', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'did', 'add', 'narrative.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'None', 'just', 'movie.ALL', 'IN', 'ALL', 'regrets', 'having', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'certainly', 'weaknesses', 'generally', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'manages', 'achieve', 'memorable', 'high', 'points', 'Even', 'more', 'important', 'believable', 'character', 'own', 'not', 'feel', 'trying', 'copy', 'something', 'else', 'will', 'be', 'hit', 'miss', 'people', 'really', 'do', 'appreciate', 'work', 'put', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'one', 'more', 'decent', 'adaptation', 'Han', 'Christian', 'Andersen', '34', 'Snow', 'Queen', '34', 'available']",The Snow Queen
1666590,A370Z6I5GBWU44,B00EC6VT8U,"M ""Delicious Strawberry""","[0, 0]","I usually enjoy twists on fairy tales and legends, but this was an extremely lackluster story with many things that did not make sense for the story. In this movie, the Snow Queen wants to engulf the whole world in winter, and there are only a few wizards and the magic mirrors they make that can stop her so she wants to kill them all. She manages to do so, but her agents are unable to kill the last wizard's offspring.Fast forward to years later when the wizard's daughter is living in an orphanage. Unbeknownst to her, her younger brother is also living there. In the beginning of the movie it looks as if Gerda is at least five years older than her brother, but in the present it does not look like there is much difference between her age and Kai's. On top of that, it looks like they're developing an attraction for one another, which seems to imply that if they had not discovered they were siblings, they'd have committed incest. Great movie for kids, right?The Snow Queen's origin is also presented here - apparently she was a girl bullied for her magic powers and she goes into a cave and in her anger and sorrow the waters in the cavern transform her into the Snow Queen. She then freezes all artists, musicians, and so on and so forth. Her character is poorly developed and the ending with Gerda turning her back into the little girl she once was was so cheesy.

1666591,A1PTBXZG04GT29,B00EC6VT8U,NewAgeMama,"[5, 8]","The Snow Queen starts right off with action. A man runs though a small village, attempting to outrun a frost that turns everything it touches to ice. Before it takes him, he manages to save his children, but the brother and sister get separated. Years later, Gerta and Kai find each other again, but the evil Snow Queen has been searching for them as well. She knows their father passed on to them the power to save their world from an endless freeze. When Kai is captured, Greta must travel to the Snow Queen's castle to set him free with only her pet weasel and a form-shifting troll she's not sure she can trust. Along the way, they meet a magical gardener, land bound pirates, and even a Indian shaman who help guide Greta on her quest.My children and I really enjoyed this film. Its a fantasy adventure filled with action and fun characters. The little troll offers some much needed comic relief as he passes gas at awkward times and has a love-hate relationship with the weasel. Each of the characters they run across have unique personalities and quirks. In the end, Greta learns that love and acceptance can solve more problems than violence.

As soon as my daughter saw the cover she asked me to put it on.It kind of reminds me of a cross between Rapunzel and Madagascar as far as the characters and animation go.

I loved the animation and the colors. I could almost feel the chill!Most importantly, I loved the message and the classic good versus evil battle.
