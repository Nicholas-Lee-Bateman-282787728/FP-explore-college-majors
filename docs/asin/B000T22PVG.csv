1087936,A1QFVNVCE5EVEV,B000T22PVG,"@129_BPM ""Dean Harris""","[12, 29]","The one thing that really annoys me about TV series on DVD, is the practice of spreading fewer episodes across multiple discs in order to raise the list price and ""fool"" consumers into thinking they are getting more for their dollar. Here's yet another example of a season series that could have easily been fit onto 3 discs instead of 4, and with a bit of creative planning could've even been squeezed onto 2 without comprising content or quality.As more and more consumers collect their favorite television shows on disc, shelf space becomes an ever growing concern. This same issue is shared with retailers as well. Producing lavish sets that took up an entire row of shelf space may have been impressive 3 or 4 years ago, but today it just doesn't make sense.And now, as studios try to push the Blu-ray and HD-DVD formats as the new and exciting media that provides 5 times the capacity of DVD; I say, ""who cares""? We rarely use the DVD format to its fullest extent.That being said, I love this show, and look forward to its final release on DVD. I just wish the manufacturer would have presented it on a few less discs and saved us all one or two inches in our ever-growing collections. A reduced price for fewer episodes would have been a bonus as well. But then again, the video distributors have learned to count on consumer ignorance to boost their profit margins.",3,More is Less,1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,1373,"['one', 'thing', 'really', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'practice', 'spreading', 'fewer', 'episodes', 'multiple', 'discs', 'order', 'raise', 'list', 'price', 'fool', 'consumers', 'thinking', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'dollar', 'Here', 'yet', 'example', 'season', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'fit', '3', 'discs', 'instead', '4', 'bit', 'creative', 'planning', 'could', ""'ve"", 'even', 'been', 'squeezed', '2', 'comprising', 'content', 'quality.As', 'more', 'more', 'consumers', 'collect', 'favorite', 'television', 'shows', 'disc', 'shelf', 'space', 'ever', 'growing', 'concern', 'same', 'issue', 'shared', 'retailers', 'as', 'well', 'Producing', 'lavish', 'sets', 'took', 'up', 'entire', 'row', 'shelf', 'space', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'impressive', '3', '4', 'years', 'ago', 'today', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.And', 'now', 'studios', 'try', 'push', 'Blu-ray', 'HD-DVD', 'formats', 'new', 'exciting', 'media', '5', 'times', 'capacity', 'DVD', 'say', 'who', 'rarely', 'use', 'DVD', 'format', 'fullest', 'extent.That', 'being', 'said', 'love', 'show', 'look', 'forward', 'final', 'release', 'DVD', 'just', 'wish', 'manufacturer', 'would', 'have', 'presented', 'few', 'less', 'discs', 'saved', 'one', 'two', 'inches', 'ever-growing', 'collections', 'reduced', 'price', 'fewer', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bonus', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'again', 'video', 'distributors', 'have', 'learned', 'count', 'consumer', 'ignorance', 'boost', 'profit', 'margins']",Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 9

Fortunately, we are able to enjoy the series over and over again on DVD.  This season somehow kept things as fun and fresh as the first 8 seasons.  How the series was able to maintain its excellence for such a long period of time is a testament to the great cast.  The interplay between the actors is excellent and it is difficult to remember that these people are really not related.  It is also rather sad to watch the final episodes as Peter Boyle's health was waning.  In spite of this, he was still great in the show.  This season features the following episodes.  Ironic that the last two shows were as strong as any in the series.  My only complaint is that there are only 16 episodes rather than the typical 22-23.

1087969,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000T22PVG,MollyRK,"[25, 31]","Just as it was difficult for fans to believe when ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" concluded its unforgettable run in 2005, it is also hard to believe that with this upcoming boxed set, all nine seasons will be available on DVD. For those who have loyally purchased these DVD's will be pleased to know that they can officially top off their collections in September 2007--a great way to begin the new school year, for sure!Although the cast and crew of ""Raymond"" could not cement down a full-season deal for this 9th year, they compromised with a satisfying helping of 16 episodes that were spread out from September to May. Oh, if only ""Gilmore Girls"" had made a similar deal after its 7th season--but for the sake of those who don't know or care about that show, I will stay on topic.What continually amazes me about this series is that despite being on the air for nearly a decade, the fact that it never lost its momentum really places it in the minority. Sure, most people would agree that the episodes from the middle seasons--such as 4, 5, and 6--were probably the very best, but that's common for almost every television series out there. This 9th season is so special, though, because it launched the year with an out-of-left-field episode that was shocking and hilarious, and it managed to bow out in the finale with plot material that mixed the trademark humor with some well-deserved poignancy. I am so impressed at how they kept the ball rolling with some fresh and genuinely funny episodes that kept fans laughing all the way through. (And think about it--how many shows that last almost ten years get to say that?)Once again, this DVD set will only contain about half the number of episodes that we enjoyed in the first 8 seasons. Still, it will certainly feel like the same old classic ""Raymond"" as soon as you start watching the series opener, ""The Home,"" where Frank and Marie render their family speechless by selling their home to Robert and Amy, packing their bags, and moving several miles away to their own little fairytale retirement home. Leaving their loved ones proves to be difficult, but it's pretty tough to pass up a place that has heated toilet seats, a 24-hour dining hall, and a group of women who immediately select Marie for the title role in their upcoming production of ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" (a very apt casting choice, to say the least). But if you've ever heard the saying ""If it sounds too good to be true, then it usually is,"" stay tuned for a hysterical twist of events just one episode later. From that point on, after the shock wears off, the show returns on track to provide the usual laughter and family friction that we all know and love. The latest snit between Debra and Marie causes Ray to manipulate the situation when he realizes how his wife's anger spices up their bedroom routine, but later on, he decides to show Debra just how lousy it feels to be ""turned down"" (which works like a charm until she uncovers the scam). 13-year-old Ally--who is not such a little girl anymore--shocks her parents when her F in math is accompanied by a very snotty attitude. 9-year-olds Michael and Geoffrey find a new friend in the son of a custodian, but of COURSE, their crazy dad can't seem to prevent himself from making a buffoon of himself in front of the child and his father. Marie considers turning in her apron when Frank adds some ""artificial flavoring"" to his meal for the first time, and Robert continues to struggle in earning the respect of Amy's family, which is not the easiest of tasks when--after catching one of his in-laws in a scandalous act--he is essentially left holding the bag. Through it all, everything culminates in a highly anticipated series finale, where Ray's trip to the hospital for some minor surgery flares into a nightmare when everyone is forced to consider what might happen if they lost their beloved Raymond.All in all, this is a considerably funny and enjoyable season for any die-hard fan of the series, and it is definitely something you'll want to pick up when it arrives in September. All of the special features haven't really been finalized yet, but it's been reported that there will definitely be the same bloopers, as well as commentary tracks for at least half of the episodes (hopefully, everyone will come in to participate for the finale episode). Some behind-the-scenes featurettes and a tribute to the late Peter Boyle are among the most requested bonuses for this last set, but we will see what they come up with. Either way, there are few people who can deny the show's knack for writing pitch-perfect scripts and bringing together a cast that delivers nearly flawlessly every single time. Though it is sad to see it go, ""the sitcom of our times"" will always be around in DVD's--and if you're looking for high-quality and consistent comedy, you can't find anything much better than this!",5,The momentum and humor of Raymond's final round slows down for no one in a terrific 9th season!,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,4887,"['Just', 'was', 'difficult', 'fans', 'believe', 'when',
