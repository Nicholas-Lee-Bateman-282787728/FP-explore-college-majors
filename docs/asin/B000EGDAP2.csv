972290,AGEWC5R7T5QLY,B000EGDAP2,"Betty Boop ""BB""","[0, 0]","I was so looking forward to this DVD. Major let down !!!! While it IS funny there is far to much interaction. When I pop in a DVD I want to relax, enjoy and be entertained--instead I was constantly pushing buttons, little time to relax and enjoy-it didn't flow til I pushed a button...NOT my idea of entertainment! Again, don't waste your money..if the DVD was only $4.99 I would say buy it but at $19.95..NO !!! If another one is released I hope there is no button pushing or I won't buy it.

I've watched his site and cartoons grow over the years and am rarely disppointed.Much more on his website.

972294,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B000EGDAP2,Micheal Hunt,"[0, 0]","I think anyone who has been on the internet for a few years has seen something over that time from Joe Cartoon, whether it be Frog In A Blender or Gerbil In A Microwave to maybe Joe Momma it would be a surprise to me if you have never come across something by Joe-Cartoon.It was just recently a friend of mine sent me the link to one I hadn't seen before and I hadn't laughed so hard at something in ages. And while looking up some more from JC at the end of a clip it mentioned DVD's.So I ordered vol 1 and 2 and expected them to have me rolling around on the floor gasping for breath. However, that was not the case at all.I'd seen mostly everything on these DVD's before, and they never make you laugh as hard the 3rd time around. I like the fact that I have them on DVD and can watch them in good quality whenever I want without the need of a computer, but I feel kind of ripped off from the price of these two videos and the lack of entertainment provided on them.Skipping past the cartoons, the other features are a series of Greenies or something that I didn't find many of them funny, and the bogus features are just that, REALLY bogus. There is some stupid clips of Joe in a destruction derby and these other clips that would be hounded with 1 votes if they where shown on YouTube. Then there is a heap of these YO-YO-YO things that where just annoying, they should have had a play all and not had to hear the beginning and ends of each one. only about 3 where worth watching but easily forgettable.then there is vintage Joe, which wasn't worth looking at either.There just doesn't seem to be enough on either volumes, even if both volumes where packed onto one disc, which could be easily done, it still would be disappointing. Honestly, you can watch it on his website for free, the DVD has nothing worth looking at that isn't on his site.Unless you are a die hard fan and and just want to help Joe make some money, then buy his DVD. Other wise, just know what you've seen already is all thats worth watching.",3,Let Downs,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,2020,"['think', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'internet', 'few', 'years', 'seen', 'something', 'time', 'Joe', 'Cartoon', 'be', 'Frog', 'A', 'Blender', 'Gerbil', 'A', 'Microwave', 'maybe', 'Joe', 'Momma', 'would', 'be', 'surprise', 'have', 'never', 'come', 'something', 'Joe-Cartoon.It', 'was', 'just', 'recently', 'friend', 'mine', 'sent', 'link', 'one', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'had', ""n't"", 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'something', 'ages', 'looking', 'up', 'more', 'JC', 'end', 'clip', 'mentioned', ""DVD's.So"", 'ordered', 'vol', '1', '2', 'expected', 'have', 'rolling', 'around', 'floor', 'gasping', 'breath', 'However', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'all.I', ""'d"", 'seen', 'mostly', 'everything', 'DVD', 'before', 'never', 'make', 'as', 'hard', '3rd', 'time', 'fact', 'have', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'good', 'quality', 'whenever', 'want', 'need', 'computer', 'feel', 'kind', 'ripped', 'price', 'two', 'videos', 'lack', 'entertainment', 'provided', 'them.Skipping', 'cartoons', 'other', 'features', 'are', 'series', 'Greenies', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'many', 'funny', 'bogus', 'features', 'are', 'just', 'REALLY', 'stupid', 'clips', 'Joe', 'destruction', 'derby', 'other', 'clips', 'would', 'be', 'hounded', '1', 'votes', 'where', 'shown', 'YouTube', 'Then', 'heap', 'YO-YO-YO', 'things', 'where', 'just', 'annoying', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'play', 'not', 'had', 'hear', 'beginning', 'ends', 'one', 'only', '3', 'where', 'worth', 'watching', 'easily', 'forgettable.then', 'vintage', 'Joe', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'looking', 'either.There', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'enough', 'volumes', 'even', 'volumes', 'where', 'packed', 'one', 'disc', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'done', 'still', 'would', 'be', 'disappointing', 'Honestly', 'can', 'watch', 'website', 'free', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'worth', 'looking', ""n't"", 'site.Unless', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'just', 'want', 'help', 'Joe', 'make', 'money', 'then', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Other', 'wise', 'just', 'know', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'already', 'thats', 'watching']",Joe Cartoon: Greatest Hits 1
