1368387,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,B003WE9C5U,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[6, 7]","Downton Abbey opens with the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, a sinking that robs the aristocratic Crawely family of both of its heirs. The family and its servants and retainers is thrown into upheaval by this news and a distant cousin must be sought to fill the role of heir. It is hoped that the eldest Crawley daughter, Lady Mary, will marry Matthew. There are problems downstairs with the arrival of Bates, Lord Crawely's new valet and two of the upper servants begin plotting to relieve Bates of his position.The plots and sub-plots all move along nicely with well-developed, likable characters that are flawed enough to be human. The over-arching theme is of the enormous political and social changes that are about to sweep this world away forever. At this time in history Lord Crawley didn't live much differently than his ancestors in the 1700's did; fashions may have changed but the ingredients and tempo of life had remained relatively static for hundreds of years. This is all about to change dramatically with the technologies of the Industrial Revolution entrenched in life, the coming of the world wars and the social changes that will make the working class and women equal participants in the life of the world.Watching these changes come to every member of this household is amazing entertainment and they are explored through politics, working conditions, relationships and the legal and social systems. Downton Abbey is a brilliant evocation of a microcosm that represents an entire social system. Very highly recommended as one of the best dramas Masterpiece Theater has ever produced. A worldwide hit.Other reviewers have commented on a homosexual kiss, but I will say that Downton Abbey is not graphic sexually. Sex is referred to but there is rarely more than a kiss and no nudity.

Originally produced for Britain's ITV, we saw the PBS Masterpiece presentation here Stateside.  The seven-part British production was mashed into four longer US parts.The writing is exquisite.  Julian Fellowes has no peer when it comes to creating these complex, character-driven Victorian (and post-Victorian) worlds.  As good as 'Gosford Park' was, Dowtown Abbey is an order of magnitude better.In terms of the acting, it's tough to know where to begin with the good performances.  Maggie Smith, as noted almost everywhere, completely steals every scene she's in.  Her impish delight in establishing her position and status - putting others in their place, uncurling a whip-smart remark, opening those big eyes in mock surprise - is a constant pleasure.  She's the gift that keeps on giving.  Hugh Bonneville is the anchor of the ensemble as patriarch Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham.  He's never been better than he is here.Crawley's three daughters - Mary, Edith and Sybil - are perfectly cast.  Michelle Dockery as Mary is a revelation to this US viewer.  Nominated for the prestigious Ian Charleson Award for Best Actress in a stage production in 2004, she's been mostly in Britain-only TV series and movies until now.  Her Mary is a beguiling combination on cunning, intelligence and sly beauty that grows on you.  She deserves a bigger audience.  By the end of the series, you find yourself urging Dan Stevens (fantastic as third cousin and designated Downton Abbey heir Matthew Crawley) to fight for her hand.The staff ensemble has equally strong performances.  Jim Carter manifests a solid dignity as Mr. Carson the butler.  Rob James-Collier's ""Thomas"" character is detestable and infuriating (meaning it's a superb rendition).  Joanne Froggatt, as Anna the Head Housemaid, needs to be a big star.  Hopefully, 'Downton Abbey' is her breakout role.I could go on to provide glowing comments about a dozen more.

The classy story of the Grantham family and the parallel world of their servants will involve you, thrill you, make you cry, laugh, cringe, and repeatedly draw you back for more! If you are the kind of person who has time on their hands, any Downton Abbey disc should come with a disclaimer: Do NOT watch unless you want to get hopelessly addicted!Sure it's a wee bit soapy, and some scenes border on the melodramatic and the sentimental, but heck, who cares? That's the entire reason it succeeds; it's pure unadultered escapism entertainment.

But when you add to THAT the brilliant human emotion, tangled relationships, colorful, sympathetic characters, wry humour, and a smart, fast-paced plot...you have the makings of near-perfection as only Masterpiece Theatre can make. This is Downton Abbey, and while it is not as epic as Game of Thrones, or as riveting as Breaking Bad or Person of Interest, Downton Abbey is like no other show on television. Your moods will rise and fall with the episodes and the fate of your favourite characters, be it Nurse O'Brien (who we all love to hate), or Edith Crawley (who we all hate to love) and every time you pop in the disc, you will be swept away for a wonderful evening of escapism to the lush mansion of Downton.Here's to much Downtonian delight in the future! 4.5 Stars!",5,So what if it's soapy?

I am glad that PBS has such a hit series and that it has attracted new fans.  But after making it through season 1, I just found it too silly and pandering to both to watch again.  The plot is obviously intended for the audience, but it is neither probable for the time and circumstances and so heavy-handed with backstabbing characters that it made me cringe.  Really, two sisters during this reputation-centric era being backstabbing harpies to each other?  A couple servants who risk their jobs continually just to be demonic for little or no reason?  The class system was still very much in place when this supposedly takes place, and vicious back-stabbing servants would be out on the street immediately with no references and little chance at a job--not to mention how completely over-the-top they are.

It's superbly entertaining, and even educational), but it lacks subtle ambiguity (because it's TV and not a feature film). So evil character are often over-the-top evil and mean-spirited to the point where it becomes unrealistic. And good characters are generally uniformly good. Meanwhile, the lords and ladies are stupidly unaware (for the most part) about the foibles of their staff. It has to be this way, because if everyone was smart and complex, then rational equilibrium would be reached in two episodes, and the series would be unacceptably short.Still though, the series does manage to become suddenly poignant and real, frequently snapping into sharp focus, before reeling off once again into unrealistic melodrama. This makes Downton Abbey no worse than most TV series you've seen, and a lot better than almost all of them. Case in point, the ""entail"" (a type of restricted inheritance) which is the plot device that drives the series, was a real issue in the early 20th century, but in fact there were many legal maneuvers to break an entail (specifically ""common recovery""). So really, an entail wasn't the immovable problem portrayed in the series. Downton Abbey isn't really about solving the problem of an entail, or getting heirs married; these are only plot devices. Rather, it's about prancing around in costumes from the period 1912-1914, and showing how scullery maids had it so bad while the landed gentry was dining on pheasants. Isn't that interesting? And of course, all of it is written and presented through a lens of today, for today's tastes and sensibilities. Because in real life, back then, the lives and loves of scullery maids, cooks, and butlers actually weren't so very interesting. But in Downtown Abbey, these people are all interesting, because it's good TV. And that's the point. It's costume-drama TV...

The show just seemed centered on a family of vapid well-to-do folks  But then in the second episode the role of Cousin Matthew, a lawyer, as a possible heir to the estate brought about some substance to the plot.  And the series instantly improved with lots of social commentary about society and culture.  There are lots of historical nuances in the show that are charming to the modern eye, such as all the hullabaloo over a typewriter and electricity in the house, but they are thought  provoking and enlightening as well.  It seems that most of the world wants Cousin Matthew to marry the oldest daughter of the house, Mary, but I'm one of the few who thinks he deserves a nicer person. However, I'm not the writer of the series.  The Dowager is one of the bright spots of the show as she clings to her aristocratic ways but eventually does the right thing in the end.

One of my partner's best friends lives in the UK and told us to check this out.  I have to say that I was impressed almost instantly.  The show is amazingly beautiful.  The setting is perfect, the costumes accurate, and the acting superlative.This is not 'The Tudors' or some crap like that.  This is stately, slow moving, and interesting social drama from 1910s and 1920s Britain high society.  There are some 'plots' among the characters, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  The crew did hire a historian to make sure that things were not getting too squirrely.What we see is the inner working of a large estate seen mainly from the servants' points of view.  We do get to know the aristocratic family, mainly the eldest daughter and the Lord, but we also get a delightful amount of screen time from an amazing Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess.There are a lot of British subtleties here, and the first series deals with inheritance laws and such, so those not too familiar might be a little lost at first... but after the first episode that becomes the story in the background and the characters' relationships (friendships most often... very rarely romantic entanglements ensue - which was the norm back then) take center stage.  There are a couple of servants who wish to 'move up' the ranks and they hatch some devious plots to discredit some of the more respected servants.  The daughters all seem to have their own agenda and the eldest and middle daughter do connive against each other quite a lot with some pretty disastrous results.Overall this is the best television series I have seen in awhile.  I was so sad when the 7th and final episode finished (blast you British TV and your short 'series').  Series (season) two is on the way, but with mixed reviews.  I've already pre-ordered.  Even if it's not as good as series one, it's still got to be better than a lot of stuff on television nowadays.  But be warned: it's very British, so that means very stately, mannered, and reflective.  But it's endearing and enjoyable.  Thanks Masterpiece Classic!

From the sinking of the Titanic to the incipience of WWl, it is a hell of a backdrop for the goings at Downton. Comparisons with Gone With The Wind are valid and worthy.While many of the characters have evolved since Season1, it's interesting to see their roots, the war between Mary and Edith being particularly gruesome. And who can forget Mary's tryst with the Turkish diplomat?

A friend told me this was one of the best things she had ever seen on tv and knowing that I liked soap operas and mini-series she recommended this to me.I absolutely love this series. The first season introduces the viewer to the world of Downton Abbey and the people who inhabit it which can be divided into to separate and distinct groups. The Grantham/Crawleys are the wealthy royalty connected owners and their servants represent the lower class that interacts with them while catering to their needs. Set roughly during 1912 - 1914, the series begins with the aftermath of the Titanic's sinking and focuses on the family's search for a husband for eldest daughter Lady Mary. Complicating matters is that there is no male family heir and the property will revert to an unknown male relative named Matthew Crawley upon the death of Lord Grantham. The first season deals with the trials and tribulations of the Grantham/Crawleys and is contrasted with romance and conflict with the people who live downstairs ----- the house staff. Comparisons to Pride and Prejudice and Upstairs/Downstairs are warranted, but that is pretty much where the comparison ends since the characters are unique and well-developed.The production values on this series are high. The sets and costumes are lush and the writing is good. The script moves quickly which elevates it in contrast to soap opera which can often be paced very slowly. The actors are first rate. From the lowly staff members to the Grantham/Crawleys, the characters are clearly defined and represent varying points of view even within the class structure portrayed.Season 1 also establishes the sentiment prevalent  during the time depicted between the classes. There will be some shifting of positions and attitudes by the end of season 1.I can't say enough good things about this series.

I liked the series, watched in on PBS, purchased it offline, and look forward to seeing how the next installments take us into the war years, but Downton Abbey really had too much of a shallow, rushed, soap opera feel to it for me to jump on the bandwagon that would hail it as the second coming of the sort of quality British costume dramas so in vogue a generation ago.Downton Abbey had a way of simply presenting something as an event without any back story. For instance: Why'd the Turk, leaping so pranidally into bed, die? What was the deal on the estranged wife causing the servant to go to prison? Why tease us with Carson the butler's intriguing past and then do nothing with it? How far back in time did the pederasty between the servant and the visiting gentleman go? It was as if a checklist was in someone's mind and one by one certain de rigueur plotlines had to be ticked off. What Downton Abbey did well it did very well, however, as I am the first to admit. The vicious and understated feud between the sisters was utterly magnificent!Primarily Downton Abbey was a visually gorgeous bit of television. It was also habit-forming in the extreme, and rewarded a viewer with quick payoffs. (Sometimes coming at the expense of depth.) I hope my complaints are remedied in future seasons and also would make the wish that the producers simply shoot longer seasons so this deserving project can unfold in a more expansive environment, because to my way of thinking, Downton Abbey too often came across seeming aggravatingly rushed.With improvement, this might honestly wind up being one of the best period dramas to come out of England in this century: right now it's just good TV.",4,Good But Not A Classic,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,2072,"['so', 'much', 'energetic', 'good', 'will', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'offering', 'creators', 'show', 'well-intended', 'bit', 'what', 'hope', 'constructive', 'criticism', 'come', 'do', 'read', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'know', 'feel', 'donning', 'safety', 'glasses', 'protective', 'hard', 'hat.Before', 'anyone', 'shoots', 'head', 'title', 'please', 'note', 'did', 'give', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'four', 'stars', 'liked', 'series', 'watched', 'PBS', 'purchased', 'offline', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'how', 'next', 'installments', 'take', 'war', 'years', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'really', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'shallow', 'rushed', 'soap', 'opera', 'feel', 'jump', 'bandwagon', 'would', 'hail', 'second', 'coming', 'sort', 'quality', 'British', 'costume', 'dramas', 'so', 'vogue', 'generation', 'ago.Downton', 'Abbey', 'had', 'way', 'simply', 'presenting', 'something', 'event', 'back', 'story', 'instance', 'Why', ""'d"", 'Turk', 'leaping', 'so', 'pranidally', 'bed', 'die', 'What', 'was', 'deal', 'estranged', 'wife', 'causing', 'servant', 'go', 'prison', 'Why', 'tease', 'Carson', 'butler', 'intriguing', 'past', 'then', 'do', 'nothing', 'How', 'far', 'back', 'time', 'did', 'pederasty', 'servant', 'visiting', 'gentleman', 'go', 'was', 'checklist', 'was', 'someone', 'mind', 'one', 'one', 'certain', 'de', 'rigueur', 'plotlines', 'had', 'be', 'ticked', 'off', 'What', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'did', 'well', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'however', 'am', 'first', 'admit', 'vicious', 'understated', 'feud', 'sisters', 'was', 'utterly', 'magnificent', 'Primarily', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'was', 'visually', 'gorgeous', 'bit', 'television', 'was', 'also', 'habit-forming', 'extreme', 'rewarded', 'viewer', 'quick', 'payoffs', 'Sometimes', 'coming', 'expense', 'depth', 'hope', 'complaints', 'are', 'remedied', 'future', 'seasons', 'also', 'would', 'make', 'wish', 'producers', 'simply', 'shoot', 'longer', 'seasons', 'so', 'deserving', 'project', 'can', 'unfold', 'more', 'expansive', 'environment', 'way', 'thinking', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'too', 'often', 'came', 'seeming', 'aggravatingly', 'rushed.With', 'improvement', 'might', 'honestly', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'period', 'dramas', 'come', 'England', 'century', 'right', 'now', 'just', 'good', 'TV']",N/A

(Mad Men just started, but after watching the first 2 episodes of the current season, I'm just not that excited.  I blame Justified.)Thank goodness Downton Abbey was highly recommended by a good friend of mine whose opinion on television I really respect.  I remember seeing the show win a lot of Emmys, Golden Globes, and Screen Actors Guild Awards.  I had read the buzz on the internet and finally decided to take the DA plunge.  I began watching Season 1 on a Friday night and was buying Season 2 here at Amazon by Saturday night for Instant Download.  By Sunday night, I had watched the first 2 seasons.This show is highly addictive!  With only 8 episodes in Season 1 and 9 in Season 2 ... its very easy to become addicted.  The last Masterpiece Theater I watched was Bleak House.  While excellent, it was also very dark.  After all, it is Dickens.  I was surprised to find that Downton Abbey is all shades of light and dark and everything in between. First and foremost, the writing is sublime which is a key for me.  The shows I've mentioned, all in very different genres, share phenomenal writing.  Next, the casting is perfection.  The acting, locations, costuming!, cinematography, musical score ... everything meshes together in perfect harmony.  The plotlines move at an intererestng pace, and the character reveals are wonderful.Now, I am the one recommending this wonderful show with the full disclosure that it is highly addictive.

1368563,A13T0V3LHOTHDL,B003WE9C5U,"E. Treants ""tree""","[5, 6]","Overall this is one of the best of the British period pieces ever made, in fact, I consider it the best.  You enter an era prior to WWI where the British Aristocracy lived like the Lords and Ladies they were.  Many houses had 25 or more gardeners.  Most had 20 to 30 bedrooms on the top floor for servants.  And many married servant couples lived in small houses through the estate.Some people have said that there are two different versions of this fantastic series.  There is only one version; it was just edited differently for American television and its 4 - hour and a half sessions as opposed to Britain's 7 - one hour sessions.  The story is exactly the same an all of the story is told in each version.  Every word is the same in each version, nothing added and nothing eliminated.  If you have seen all four of the PBS version, you have seen the entire UK Edition.Now having said all of that, it was worth the money to see this once again.  Every minute was enjoyable.  There are enough other reviews that talk all about what you will see so I shall not repeat the entire plot again.  The price here at Amazon is a bargain.  This series is much more interesting than Upstairs/Downstairs ever hoped to be.On Disc One there are ""Special Features.""  Of course there has to be a ""Making of...""  This is one of the more interesting Making of that I have seen.  It gives insight into both the making and the relationships of the actors and their character development.  Secondly there is an episode entitled, ""A House in History.""  The Countess of  Carnarvon, who lives in and owns Highclere Castle (in Berkshire, England) talks about the house and the family who has resided there.  Then this episode goes into the relationships of the servants as well as the problems with the class system.  The First World War was a turning point in the British Aristocracy and Servant system.  Everything changed following the war and this series puts us on the cusp of that change.  We get to experience the schemes as well as the relationships.  Finally we get the, ""Great British Heritage Pass,""  This is nothing more than an offer to go on line and shop for all things British.",5,Better than Upstairs / Downstairs in many ways,1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,2172,"['Overall', 'one', 'best', 'British', 'period', 'pieces', 'ever', 'made', 'fact', 'consider', 'best', 'enter', 'era', 'prior', 'WWI', 'where', 'British', 'Aristocracy', 'lived', 'Lords', 'Ladies', 'were', 'Many', 'houses', 'had', '25', 'more', 'gardeners', 'Most', 'had', '20', '30', 'bedrooms', 'top', 'floor', 'servants', 'many', 'married', 'servant', 'couples', 'lived', 'small', 'houses', 'estate.Some', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'versions', 'fantastic', 'series', 'only', 'one', 'version', 'was', 'just', 'edited', 'differently', 'American', 'television', '4', 'hour', 'half', 'sessions', 'opposed', 'Britain', '7', 'one', 'hour', 'sessions', 'story', 'exactly', 'same', 'story', 'told', 'version', 'word', 'same', 'version', 'nothing', 'added', 'nothing', 'eliminated', 'have', 'seen', 'four', 'PBS', 'version', 'have', 'seen', 'entire', 'UK', 'Edition.Now', 'having', 'said', 'was', 'worth', 'money', 'see', 'once', 'again', 'Every', 'minute', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'enough', 'other', 'reviews', 'talk', 'what', 'will', 'see', 'so', 'shall', 'not', 'repeat', 'entire', 'plot', 'again', 'price', 'here', 'Amazon', 'bargain', 'series', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'ever', 'hoped', 'be.On', 'Disc', 'One', 'are', 'Special', 'Features', 'course', 'there', 'be', 'Making', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'Making', 'have', 'seen', 'insight', 'making', 'relationships', 'actors', 'character', 'development', 'Secondly', 'episode', 'entitled', 'House', 'History', 'Countess', 'Carnarvon', 'who', 'Highclere', 'Castle', 'Berkshire', 'England', 'talks', 'house', 'family', 'who', 'resided', 'there', 'Then', 'episode', 'relationships', 'servants', 'as', 'well', 'problems', 'class', 'system', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'British', 'Aristocracy', 'Servant', 'system', 'Everything', 'changed', 'following', 'war', 'series', 'cusp', 'change', 'get', 'experience', 'schemes', 'as', 'well', 'relationships', 'Finally', 'get', 'Great', 'British', 'Heritage', 'Pass', 'nothing', 'more', 'offer', 'go', 'line', 'shop', 'things', 'British']",N/A

But I am so glad I did!  This show is, put simply, magnificent.  Words cannot describe how interesting, riveting, charming, enjoyable and entertaining it really is.  From the first moment I was transported to early 20th century England and remained enchanted throughout the entire season.Virtually every character is interesting in one way or another.  Lord Grantham is aristocratic but kind; Lady Grantham is stunningly beautiful, refined and as down-to-earth as possible given her role.  Both Lady Sybil and Edith are different yet they fit seamless into the stories.  Lady Mary is also stunningly beautiful like her mother and her accent is music to one's ears.  Stealing the show, however, is none other than the Dowager Countess, who has some of the greatest lines throughout the show.Matthew and Isobel Crawley show another side of Downton and both of their characters are fresh and exciting.  The rivalry between the Dowager Countess and Mrs. Crawley is, at time, laugh out loud funny.The staff are equally enchanting, for both the interesting sub plots they play and the wonderful actors and actresses who play them.

L'hoir,"[4, 4]","I got snagged on this series by accident, when I discovered that what used to be our local PBS station sold out to Big Business, and was no longer a Public Broadcasting Service. In a panic, I went straight to the PBS Website and found to my delight that the first two episodes of this series could be viewed in full, on line. Well, after viewing episodes one and two, I was hooked. I absolutely HAD to have episode three and the rest of the series; and then I noticed that I could purchase the entire uncut UK series for a laughably low-priced ""season pass"" on I-Tunes. Oh the rapture as it automatically downloaded onto my computer every week in High Definition!From the bright copper kettles in the kitchen to the Lady Mary's opalescent beaded gowns, the picture is so incredibly sharp that I can even see a tiny hole (not noticeable in regular definition) torn on the shoulder of the black chiffon sleeve on one of her elaborate velvet gowns. And the interiors of the stately home with its gilded bronze columns, satin brocaded wallpaper, classical statues, and luxurious Persian carpets, are scrumptious to behold. What a visual treat!As for the characters and the story, ""Downton Abbey"" represents British Television at its best! Julian Fellowes' script is pitch perfect, both upstairs and downstairs, where snobbery competes with compassion. Unlike ""Gosford Park"" in which the conversation drifted in and out of earshot, every word of his scintillating dialogue can be understood and enjoyed. Maggie Smith, of course, has all the verbal zingers, and she delivers them with her customary panache. Hugh Bonneville as the benevolent Lord of the Manor and Elizabeth McGovern as the wealthy American Heiress whom he has married for her money are outstanding, as are both actors playing his cousins and heirs. The story has something for everyone, with the perpetual conniving between the footman and the mistress's lady's maid, perpetually thwarted by the respectable valet (with a chequered past) and by the daughters' good-hearted maid; the jealous sniping of the two older right honourable siblings, and the social consciousness of the youngest; the desire of one of the maids to leave the safe respectability of domestic service for the dangerous uncertainty of secretarial work; intrigue, romance, and a surfeit of candlelit suppers that would make Hyacinth Bouquet quiver with envy. Some may find the scenario predictable, but it is predictable in ever-the-nicest manner; a world as we might imagine it to have been, before everything changed (for better or worse) in 1914.And, joy of joy, there is a season 2!

1368576,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B003WE9C5U,FYI,"[1, 1]","I can't begin to elaborate how completely this elegant series sucked us in, along withMasterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 2 (Original U.K. Unedited Edition). We couldn't move. We were transfixed. I am shaky, going off Downton Abbey, experiencing disorientation and withdrawal. I need another dose of Maggie Smith's acerbic wit (the way she manipulates that cane!), she is the cherry on top of a deceptive confection - this stuff is deep. The cast is perfection. The narrative weaves together hopes and aspirations of upper/lower castes of a Yorkshire manor house. Even within the upper-classes, fine distinctions of class are drawn, whether one is a descendant of Plantagenet stock (I know such, descendants of people the Tudors seized power from, like Margaret Pole, and the Percy, Stafford, and Howard families; some became early-American colonists), or, as grande dame Maggie Smith (loved her ever sinceThe Prime of Miss Jean Brodie) points out, the more recent Hapsburg. Much like a feudal system, all the occupants and their destinies are interdependent, no one is an island.I shouldn't have been surprised by the emotional nuances Julian Fellowes imbues his writing with, after seeing his marvelously layered performance inMonarch of the Glen: Complete Collection. Fellowes' scripts breathe, the story is full of life. Like superb art that values the space around an object, as well as the focus of the painting (Vermeer, Van de Velde), his creations are given enough space for viewers' imaginations to engage, to contemplate. Yet everything moves at a brisk pace, the narrative is relentlessly involving and enveloping. The show will cast a spell. As with Austin, Eliot, Thackeray, Wharton, lessons about life and consequences of actions are gently but firmly taught. The core of what it is to be a moral person is skillfully examined, in a society less permissive than ours. Love in all it's forms is exquisitely drawn, characters deepen and grow, facing obstacles of their own making, or of the world's. This story is all heart, about finding real truth and love, what life means beyond superficial notions or expectations.

'Downton Abbey' was conceived and written for a British commercial TV broadcaster.This series made no impact on me the first time I saw it. The ladies in the household had other ideas. There they were, huddled up together nursing mugs of sweetened tea totally engrossed with - Mr Bates?  Thinking that watching too much television drama of doubtful quality and worthiness is bad for the soul, I tend to leave them to their fantasies for whatever keeps the ladies happy, keeps me out of trouble.

It didn't take too long however, before I became as engrossed in 'Downton Abbey' as the rest of the family, and found myself nursing a hot mug of tea huddled around the TV with them all for a brief hour of stimulating escapism.  Because I only joined the series at episode four, buying the complete series on Blu-ray has given our household the opportunity to watch the complete series over and over again, and for me to catch up with the episodes that I had missed the first time around.Series Two is now complete and ready for broadcasting here in the UK, during this month of September 2011.  The story has moved on to the late summer of 1914 as the Great War begins...  Our family can hardly wait to find out what is in store for all the characters.  With almost a whole generation of young men from Britain and the Empire about to be slaughtered in Flanders' fields, we should see most of the male characters either maimed or killed, and nearly all the eligible young ladies facing futures of lonely spinsterhood as ""Old maids"".Before things get too maudlin, Series Three should take us into the ""Roaring twenties"" to relieve some of the gloom and doom and the pain of loss and mourning.  Series Four should take us through the depressed 1930's and the rise of Fascism.  Series Five should cover WW2 when Downton Abbey is requisitioned for use by the U.S.8th Air Force - and the rest as they say is history.

Set between 1912 and 1914, Downton Abbey chronicles the conflict of class, gender, and politics, and serves it up with a refreshing dollop of sizzle and scandal. Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth McGovern, and Dame Maggie Smith (as Robert, Earl of Grantham, Cora, Countess of Grantham, and Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham, respectively) are knock outs, but the rest of the cast are no slouches either, with the stunning Michelle Dockery at the forefront as Lady Mary Crawley, who is the selfish, proud, and vindictive eldest daughter you can't help but like. The actors and the stunning interiors of Highclere Castle, home to the Earls of Carnarvon, give Downton Abbey a glossy, sophisticated sheen, even when the script's twists and turns can be a bit of a let-down.

1368598,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003WE9C5U,Grady Harp,"[13, 14]","DOWNTON ABBEY is one of the things the British do best. This seven part series has it all - crisp dialogue, stunning settings/scenery/costumes, an all-encompassing view of class distinction not only between the upper class or gentry versus the middle class (who often have as much money but come into via labor versus inheritance) but also among the servant class, and a cast of many of the finest British actors before the public. Julian Fellowes is in fine form here as the writer, taking on a story about 1912 England and the microcosm of Downton Abbey, a mansion and grounds run by the elegant Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), his mother Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham (Dame Maggie Smith at her best), and Cora Crawley Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern0 - the moneyed American whom Robert married in order to retain the Abbey and their daughters, Ladies Mary (Michelle Dockery), Edith (Laura Carmichael) and Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay). Much of the story revolves around the problem of inheritance (entailment) as the heirs apparent to the Abbey are victims of the Titanic disaster that opens the story. The Abbey must be passed on to a monied heir and the hunt is on.As with other Masterpiece Theater pieces this story examines the 'upstairs/downstairs' bifurcation of the Abbey and the cast of characters 'below' is as fine as the gentrified owners: Mr Carson (Jim Carter) is the head voice, followed by Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan), the cook Mrs. Patmore (Lesley Nicol), the footman Thomas (Rob James-Collier) who just happens to have had an affair with the visiting Duke who could have been the new heir, and the new valet John Bates (Brendan Coyle) - a man the staff doesn't tolerate because of his use of a cane due to a war injury, etc etc etc. They are all fascinating people with their own set of prejudices not unlike those of their masters.The story progresses along the lines of finding a new heir for the Abbey, a problem that involves everyone in the household, and it is this strange playing out of English class distinction that makes the series so engrossing. Another classic from the Masterpiece Theater.

Yes, there is much to like, and the script and acting draws you in with addictive power, and yet, all is not quite as perfect as the enthusiasts want us to believe.We have an English family of aristocrats in the years 1912 to 14. The story stretches from the Titanic to the declaration of war against Germany. The family has their problems, and a whole army of servants runs the house. We get involved in intrigues and affairs, some of which are of exquisite meanness, mostly between the women of the family and between the men of the servants army. The battle lines on the family side involve mainly the dowager and her American daughter in law, as well as the two older daughters. The servants battle about promotions and love. The usual. You could call it a luxury suds soup. Addictive.What bothered me was that quite a few of the characters are just too good to be true. Maybe they have to balance the meanness of the ladies? Worst of the do-gooders is valet Bates, an angel of a man. So thinks maid Anna, another angel. In the same bracket of goodness is the youngest daughter of the Earl, while the two older ones are extremes of sisterly hatred. Cain and Abel were best friends, comparatively.In more general terms: the employer to staff relations in this family enterprise are painted in a just too ridiculously rosy light. The Earl will be the most popular boss in the history of feudalism. This picture doesn't hold water.Who saves the day? Maggie Smith as the dowager in one of her best and most amusing parts of many over many decades. She is simply marvelous in her xenophobic snobbery and class consciousness.The whole thing might well have been written by a son of Anthony Trollope. But we know it wasn't.In one of the episode we see a hunting scene, which one of the riders afterwards describes as having felt like in a Trollope novel.",4,The Maggie Smith show,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,1929,"['triumph', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'wee', 'bit', 'top', 'taste', 'Yes', 'much', 'like', 'script', 'acting', 'draws', 'addictive', 'power', 'yet', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'perfect', 'enthusiasts', 'want', 'believe.We', 'have', 'English', 'family', 'aristocrats', 'years', '1912', '14', 'story', 'stretches', 'Titanic', 'declaration', 'war', 'Germany', 'family', 'problems', 'whole', 'army', 'servants', 'house', 'get', 'involved', 'intrigues', 'affairs', 'are', 'exquisite', 'meanness', 'mostly', 'women', 'family', 'men', 'servants', 'army', 'battle', 'lines', 'family', 'side', 'involve', 'mainly', 'dowager', 'American', 'daughter', 'law', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'older', 'daughters', 'servants', 'battle', 'promotions', 'love', 'usual', 'could', 'call', 'luxury', 'suds', 'soup', 'Addictive.What', 'bothered', 'was', 'quite', 'few', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'Maybe', 'have', 'balance', 'meanness', 'ladies', 'Worst', 'do-gooders', 'valet', 'Bates', 'angel', 'man', 'So', 'thinks', 'maid', 'Anna', 'angel', 'same', 'bracket', 'goodness', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Earl', 'two', 'older', 'ones', 'are', 'extremes', 'sisterly', 'hatred', 'Cain', 'Abel', 'were', 'best', 'friends', 'comparatively.In', 'more', 'general', 'terms', 'employer', 'staff', 'relations', 'family', 'enterprise', 'are', 'painted', 'just', 'too', 'ridiculously', 'rosy', 'light', 'Earl', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'popular', 'boss', 'history', 'feudalism', 'picture', ""n't"", 'hold', 'water.Who', 'day', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'dowager', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'amusing', 'parts', 'many', 'many', 'decades', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'xenophobic', 'snobbery', 'class', 'consciousness.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'son', 'Anthony', 'Trollope', 'know', 'one', 'episode', 'see', 'hunting', 'scene', 'one', 'riders', 'afterwards', 'describes', 'having', 'felt', 'Trollope', 'novel']",N/A

We looked forward to the next episode, and await the opportunity to go back to Downton!As an American, I had a vague idea of the sorts of rules that Earl Grantham and his family live by, especially when it comes to inheritances. I can say I know much more about those rules now! (For further reading, I recommend 'Justice Hall' by Laurie R. King, which gives a Sherlockian twist to what happens as the Great War and personal grudges wreak havoc on the lines of succession in another great house. But I digress.)This series would be a great teaching tool in high school or college level history classes, especially as it deals with the emerging voice of women (the youngest Crawley daughter is a bloomer-wearing suffragette), the Titanic disaster and its repercussions, the workings of a grand house and its role towards its tenant farmers (and the changes that will come to this caste due to the war), and of course the divides between upper and lower classes.Maggie Smith is wonderful as the Dowager Countess. She is definitely 'old school' and makes no bones about her preferring things to stay that way, thank you very much! However she does see the value of some change, and reveals herself to be a real person behind her thick aristocratic walls. I agree with another reviewer that she has some of the funniest lines of the series, and many of those come as a welcome bit of levity during a particularly trying time for the family.I didn't like the character of Mary Crawley, the Earl's oldest daughter, at first, but she--like most everyone else in this series--is trying to find her way and to be happy without making too much of a mess of things in the process. The two J. R. Ewings of the series (you know, the ones you love to hate!) are Edith, the middle Crawley daughter, and Thomas, the conniving footman. Miss O'Brien, Lady Cora's lady's maid, is also quite nasty, but has a moment where she realizes that her hasty actions have consequences that she never truly intended, and the change that comes over her is heartbreaking to watch.It's interesting to note that the people in this time period and this class had the same problems that people have today (and have always had)--love, jealousy, hatching dire plots against one another, dalliances that go horribly awry--it's just that those things took more effort to unsnarl, with far more dire consequences.This the kind of series that makes you Google things after the credits roll!

1368617,A1SCJWCMQ3W3KK,B003WE9C5U,Irishgal,"[2, 2]","I'll be honest: I'd never heard of ""Downton Abbey"" when the first season was airing on PBS in the U.S. It was only when season two came on that I began to hear of friends gushing about the series. Knowing that, as a period drama, it was probably better to see it in order, I settled down one night with season one. Seven hours later, I finished, absolutely gobsmacked. Where had I been?The show is tagged as a ""family saga"", and for the most part, that's correct. It's about the aristocratic Crawley family of North Yorkshire and the servants who live on their estate (called 'Downton Abbey'). The series opens with the sinking of the Titanic and the news that the heirs to the estate, Lord Grantham's cousin, James, and his only son, Patrick, are dead. Most of the first season is occupied with the question of succession: because the Earl has three daughters, none of them can inherit. The house, title, and family fortune will now go to a distant cousin, a middle-class lawyer from Manchester named Matthew Crawley. Initially, the family isn't too thrilled with Cousin Matthew. And, to be frank, he's not too happy to be in his position, either. But over the next two years, as the family goes through ups and downs, secrets and scandals, as the world changes around them almost faster than they can comprehend, they finally come together into a unit.What makes this show so incredibly special is the way it's presented. Yes, there are over twenty main characters, featuring everyone from the intimidating Dowager Countess (played by Dame Maggie Smith, who manages to steal virtually every scene she's in) to the young and sometimes daft kitchen maid. But every character has a storyline, and no matter where they fall in the hierarchy of the house, every storyline is given equal screen time. Whether it's the secret of the butler's past, a housemaid's ambition to be a secretary, or the scheming of Lord Grantham's middle daughter, every story weaves its way onto your screen so you feel like you are part of the house itself.Like most British dramas featured on Masterpiece, the acting on here is superb. It's not just the established actors, like Jim Carter or Maggie Smith. It's also the younger group, from Masterpiece ""veterans"" like Michelle Dockery or Dan Stevens to newcomers Sophie McShera or Thomas Howes. They are all absolutely splendid, each actor highlighting not only the strengths but flaws of their characters. In addition, the setting is sumptious, filmed at Highclere Castle, and decadent in its elegance.There has been much talk (and seeming confusion) over which version of ""Downton Abbey"" is on the DVD. When the show airs on PBS, yes, it is edited from the original ITV version. In some cases, it's very heavily edited. But the DVD version here is the ORIGINAL ITV version, not the one shown on PBS. As far as I know, you cannot buy the edited-down PBS version, so don't worry about being cheated out of important scenes.Initially, I wasn't sure what to expect with this show. I am completely blown away by the level of production, acting, writing, and storytelling. It's a series that sucks you in and doesn't let you go until it's had its say. With a good five months until season 3 starts in the U.S., now is a great time to see what all the fuss is about.",5,What All the Fuss is About,1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,3287,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'when', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'airing', 'PBS', 'U.S', 'was', 'only', 'when', 'season', 'two', 'came', 'began', 'hear', 'friends', 'gushing', 'series', 'Knowing', 'that', 'period', 'drama', 'was', 'probably', 'better', 'see', 'order', 'settled', 'down', 'one', 'night', 'season', 'one', 'Seven', 'hours', 'later', 'finished', 'absolutely', 'gobsmacked', 'Where', 'had', 'been', 'show', 'tagged', 'family', 'saga', 'most', 'part', 'correct', 'aristocratic', 'Crawley', 'family', 'North', 'Yorkshire', 'servants', 'who', 'live', 'estate', 'called', ""'Downton"", 'Abbey', 'series', 'sinking', 'Titanic', 'news', 'heirs', 'estate', 'Lord', 'Grantham', 'cousin', 'James', 'only', 'son', 'Patrick', 'are', 'dead', 'Most', 'first', 'season', 'occupied', 'question', 'succession', 'Earl', 'three', 'daughters', 'none', 'can', 'inherit', 'house', 'title', 'family', 'fortune', 'will', 'now', 'go', 'distant', 'cousin', 'middle-class', 'lawyer', 'Manchester', 'named', 'Matthew', 'Crawley', 'Initially', 'family', ""n't"", 'too', 'thrilled', 'Cousin', 'Matthew', 'be', 'frank', 'not', 'too', 'happy', 'be', 'position', 'either', 'next', 'two', 'years', 'family', 'ups', 'downs', 'secrets', 'scandals', 'world', 'almost', 'faster', 'can', 'comprehend', 'finally', 'come', 'together', 'unit.What', 'show', 'so', 'incredibly', 'special', 'way', 'presented', 'Yes', 'are', 'twenty', 'main', 'characters', 'featuring', 'everyone', 'intimidating', 'Dowager', 'Countess', 'played', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'who', 'steal', 'virtually', 'scene', 'young', 'sometimes', 'daft', 'kitchen', 'maid', 'character', 'storyline', 'matter', 'where', 'fall', 'hierarchy', 'house', 'storyline', 'given', 'equal', 'screen', 'time', 'secret', 'butler', 'past', 'housemaid', 'ambition', 'be', 'secretary', 'scheming', 'Lord', 'Grantham', 'middle', 'daughter', 'story', 'way', 'screen', 'feel', 'are', 'part', 'house', 'most', 'British', 'dramas', 'featured', 'Masterpiece', 'acting', 'here', 'superb', 'not', 'just', 'established', 'actors', 'Jim', 'Carter', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'also', 'younger', 'group', 'Masterpiece', 'veterans', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'newcomers', 'Sophie', 'McShera', 'Thomas', 'Howes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'splendid', 'actor', 'highlighting', 'not', 'only', 'strengths', 'flaws', 'characters', 'addition', 'setting', 'sumptious', 'filmed', 'Highclere', 'Castle', 'decadent', 'elegance.There', 'been', 'much', 'talk', 'seeming', 'confusion', 'version', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'DVD', 'When', 'show', 'PBS', 'yes', 'edited', 'original', 'ITV', 'version', 'cases', 'very', 'heavily', 'edited', 'DVD', 'version', 'here', 'ORIGINAL', 'ITV', 'version', 'not', 'one', 'shown', 'PBS', 'As', 'far', 'know', 'can', 'not', 'buy', 'edited-down', 'PBS', 'version', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'being', 'cheated', 'important', 'scenes.Initially', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'show', 'am', 'completely', 'blown', 'away', 'level', 'production', 'acting', 'writing', 'storytelling', 'series', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'had', 'say', 'good', 'five', 'months', 'season', '3', 'starts', 'U.S.', 'now', 'great', 'time', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'about']",N/A

Set in 1912-14, the series centers upon the superdecent Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) and his American heiress wife Cora (Elizabeth McGovern), who has given him an enormous dowry, legally wrapped up since their marriage with the entail of their country house, and three daughters, but no sons. When the Titanic sinks, carrying down with it the earl's only male first cousin and his only son, the heir becomes the earl's third cousin, a middle-class lawyer Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) from Manchester; the earl invites him and his practical mother Isobel (Penelope Wilton) to live on the estate, and the new heir becomes attracted, despite himself, to the earl's eldest daughter, the ornery Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery). And around them flow the great house's multiple servants, each of whom has a back-story as involved as that of Matthew or Lady Mary.If this all sounds like UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS, it should: clearly that was the inspiration for Julian Fellowes's film collaboration with Robert Altman, GOSFORD PARK, that led in turn to this mini-series. It is perhaps to be wished the time period had not been nearly exactly that of the old BBC series, but the Edwardian era was certainly when there was a fascinating sense of change in the cultural landscape which would be exacerbated by the First World War (which is exactly on the cusp of which this season ends). The acting is first-rate, and of course anything that allows Maggie Smith to play another one of her great comic aristocratic gargoyles is to be commended: her supremacy in playing Restoration comedy has allowed her to be the mistress of the cutting remark and the outraged expostulation, and Fellowes supplies her with terrific lines (and with a superb sparring partner in Isobel Crawley, neatly played by Wilton). The entanglements, romantic and professional, of the characters is fairly absorbing, and the Victorian ""Jacobethan"" fantasia of Highclere Castle (the home to the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon) is a grand playhouse for all this drama. The first season DVD comes with a charming ""Making of"" feature and a disappointingly uninformative short piece on Highclere Castle.",5,"""They live in wigwams""",1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,2406,"['Such', 'opinion', 'Violet', 'Dowager', 'Countess', 'Grantham', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'regarding', 'daughter-in-law', 'American', 'kinsmen', 'certainly', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Their', 'Ladyships', 'relatives', 'servants', 'superb', '2009', 'ITV', 'soap', 'opera', 'Set', '1912-14', 'series', 'centers', 'superdecent', 'Earl', 'Grantham', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'American', 'heiress', 'wife', 'Cora', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern', 'who', 'given', 'enormous', 'dowry', 'legally', 'wrapped', 'up', 'marriage', 'entail', 'country', 'house', 'three', 'daughters', 'sons', 'When', 'Titanic', 'sinks', 'carrying', 'down', 'earl', 'only', 'male', 'first', 'cousin', 'only', 'son', 'heir', 'earl', 'third', 'cousin', 'middle-class', 'lawyer', 'Matthew', 'Crawley', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'Manchester', 'earl', 'practical', 'mother', 'Isobel', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'live', 'estate', 'new', 'heir', 'becomes', 'attracted', 'earl', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'ornery', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'flow', 'great', 'house', 'multiple', 'servants', 'whom', 'back-story', 'as', 'involved', 'Matthew', 'Lady', 'Mary.If', 'UPSTAIRS', 'DOWNSTAIRS', 'should', 'clearly', 'was', 'inspiration', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'film', 'collaboration', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'GOSFORD', 'PARK', 'led', 'turn', 'mini-series', 'perhaps', 'be', 'wished', 'time', 'period', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'nearly', 'exactly', 'old', 'BBC', 'series', 'Edwardian', 'era', 'was', 'certainly', 'when', 'was', 'fascinating', 'sense', 'change', 'cultural', 'landscape', 'would', 'be', 'exacerbated', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'exactly', 'cusp', 'season', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'course', 'anything', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'play', 'one', 'great', 'comic', 'aristocratic', 'gargoyles', 'be', 'commended', 'supremacy', 'playing', 'Restoration', 'comedy', 'allowed', 'be', 'mistress', 'cutting', 'remark', 'outraged', 'expostulation', 'Fellowes', 'terrific', 'lines', 'superb', 'sparring', 'partner', 'Isobel', 'Crawley', 'neatly', 'played', 'Wilton', 'entanglements', 'romantic', 'professional', 'characters', 'fairly', 'absorbing', 'Victorian', 'Jacobethan', 'fantasia', 'Highclere', 'Castle', 'home', 'Earl', 'Countess', 'Carnarvon', 'grand', 'playhouse', 'drama', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'charming', 'Making', 'feature', 'disappointingly', 'uninformative', 'short', 'piece', 'Highclere', 'Castle']",N/A

It is an excellent story of how the wealthy in England lived in the years 1912 to 1914 and the problems they faced.  On the other hand is the life of the servants who work in the home and support and help to care for the family, property and home and meals.You quickly become aware of the different lifestyles and the different standards of living and the worries of life.  The wealthy Crawley family lives in luxury and in the magnificent estate home.  Their family consists of Robert and Cora Crawley and their three daughters.  Their life is in turmoil as the heir apparent and his son are killed when the Titanic sinks.  They stand to not only lose the estate but to also lose the family fortune because of a contractual agreement where only a male heir can be endowed with the control of the money and property.The family's problems are a main part of the series but the servants also play a major role.  The large staff of the home employs all types of personalities and intellects.  Their lives, personal conflicts and political beliefs become great fodder for a rich and detailed storyline.

Very annoying, it never changes.  As for the entire overall  cast, and story,  I find it to be following a theme quite well from one season to the next.  As the years pass and the war comes around, peoples lives have changed and adjusted to the changing times.  People do make changes in their lives and in their attitudes about life, as circumstances around them are mostly beyond ones control.  The story reflects this well.

1368660,A1M1Y5UGONAW06,B003WE9C5U,Jody,"[7, 10]","NO SPOILERSDownton Abbey begins with news of the Titanic disaster and the arrival of a new valet for Lord Crawley.  Both events have far reaching consequences.  The heir to the entailed Downton is lost at sea, and the new valet dashes the hopes of an ambitious footman.The new Downton heir is an unknown third cousin who, horrors!, has A Job and there is much sneering and judging as he and his mother become part of life at Downton.  The plan is to match one of the daughters to The Heir, but they have plans of their own as does The Heir.  Dame Maggie Smith is Lord Crawley's ascerbic mother, and perks things up considerably when she appears.  Elizabeth McGovern is very convincing as Cora, Lady Crawley, an American who married for love though her husband didn't.  In fact, most of the cast is splendid, as are the costumes and sets.  My one quibble is that except for Dame Maggie Smith none of the women looks at home in the clothes.  Notice I didn't say ""comfortable"".There's plenty of interesting stuff going on in Downton Abbey--secrets, lies, attempted blackmail and hidden agendas--as well as some superb acting.  There are also some situations and characters I just didn't buy and some very ill bred behavior from people who should know better. For example, Lord Crawley's mother, played by Maggie Smith, is insufferably rude to the new heir's mother, yet the next day she goes out of her way to be kind to the lady's butler.  Perhaps this was meant to indicate the difference in her regard for an upstart relative versus a valued family retainer, yet it was a bit jarring. Still, all the backstabbing, gossip and undermining in Downton Abbey makes for great soap opera.Fans of Upstairs Downstairs can't help but compare and contrast the two series and I have to say this.  Downton Abbey doesn't have the same magic as Upstairs Downstairs, nor the same sense of a bygone time.  Upstairs Downstairs was about people, both aristocrats and servants, who spent their lives struggling to live up to very high standards, sometimes impossibly so.  That's what made it so fascinating.  It had a grace and an elegance and a leisurely pace that's missing in Downton Abbey, not to mention the lovely manners everyone had under any and all circumstances.Downton Abbey is kind of Desperate Edwardian Housewives meets Stately Home Dynasty, and it's fun to watch, just don't expect Eaton Place.

Cared for by a large staff of servants, the Earl and Countess of Grantham, their three young daughters, and the Earl's mother the Dowager Countess appear to lead an idyllic existence.  Things are not so sunny for their staff, which is embroiled in tension and jealousies. Unfortunately, news arrives of the death of the Earl's heir presumptive on the Titanic, and immediately turmoil begins.  How is the new heir to be educated in the duties and responsibilities of his new position?  What will happen to the three daughters, especially the oldest, dashing and elegant Lady Mary? How will the Crawleys and their servants cope with the new century's problems?The story is well told, with numerous subplots and minor characters who add additional interest.  There are some missteps here and there, chiefly in the use of sometimes anachronistic language and the tendency of the Crawleys to be much more friendly with their staff than would have been considered acceptable.  But these are minor issues which do not detract from the superbly beautiful settings and the magnificent cast, including Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess.This series ends with the outbreak of World War I and with numerous hanging threads, and its fans will eagerly await the next installments.",5,Edwardian Romance With A Few Modern Twists,1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,1561,"['Downton', 'Abbey', 'beautifully', 'depicted', 'period', 'romance', 'will', 'remind', 'viewers', 'classic', 'British', 'dramas', '1960s', '1970s', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'Pallisers', 'April', '1912', 'noble', 'Crawley', 'family', 'resides', 'ancestral', 'home', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Cared', 'large', 'staff', 'servants', 'Earl', 'Countess', 'Grantham', 'three', 'young', 'daughters', 'Earl', 'mother', 'Dowager', 'Countess', 'appear', 'lead', 'idyllic', 'existence', 'Things', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'sunny', 'staff', 'embroiled', 'tension', 'jealousies', 'Unfortunately', 'news', 'arrives', 'death', 'Earl', 'heir', 'presumptive', 'Titanic', 'immediately', 'turmoil', 'begins', 'How', 'new', 'heir', 'be', 'educated', 'duties', 'responsibilities', 'new', 'position', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'three', 'daughters', 'especially', 'oldest', 'dashing', 'elegant', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'How', 'will', 'Crawleys', 'servants', 'cope', 'new', 'century', 'problems', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'numerous', 'subplots', 'minor', 'characters', 'who', 'add', 'additional', 'interest', 'are', 'missteps', 'here', 'there', 'chiefly', 'use', 'sometimes', 'anachronistic', 'language', 'tendency', 'Crawleys', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'friendly', 'staff', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'acceptable', 'are', 'minor', 'issues', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'superbly', 'beautiful', 'settings', 'magnificent', 'cast', 'including', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Dowager', 'Countess.This', 'series', 'outbreak', 'World', 'War', 'numerous', 'hanging', 'threads', 'fans', 'will', 'eagerly', 'await', 'next', 'installments']",N/A

It does not need to be, it has more than enough wonderful qualities to stand side by side on its own merits.Longtime fans of Julian Fellowes, my husband and I set the DVR to PBS when we discovered this newest work.  Thankfully, family who had already seen the series in the UK sent us a copy so we did not have to rely on the weekly morsels from PBS.  Sadly, we too soon completed the series.  Of course, Amazon reviewers knew a second series was in the works.  Hurrah!As to be expected, Fellowes' script is flawless, dialogue crisp and realistic.  I found nothing to quibble about with the actors' accents, no matter what their social status.  The acting is ethereal, how could it be anything else with this cast?  Maggie Smith, a true treasure of the British realm. (Who else could utter ""What is a weekend?"" with such aplomb?) Every scene she appears in is golden.  Her son, Hugh Bonneville, and daughter-in-law, Elizabeth McGovern, along with Michelle Dockery as the eldest daughter(who needs to be married off STAT) and  Downstairs staff luminaries, Jim Carter and Brendan Coyle with many others give standout, solid performances. It is a large cast that composes this Edwardian classic, all who I hope are in the Second Series.The storyline has been previously told by other reviewers, so I will not repeat it. Let us just say it has all the makings of a ""see again and again"" DVD.  No doubt I will gift it to friends who enjoy British costume dramas.I highly recommend it to all who love a British period piece with lush backgrounds and exquisite costuming.

1368707,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003WE9C5U,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[203, 220]","A transporting miniseries from PBS, the crisp and delightful ""Downton Abbey"" is easily my favorite Masterpiece Theater presentation since the impeccable ""Bleak House."" Perhaps not as austere as you might expect, ""Downton Abbey"" combines an ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" drama with some rather soapy plot points and a healthy dose of scathing British wit. While many of the recent successful Masterpiece Theater productions have benefited from a distinguished literary pedigree, this original creation was whipped up with considerable verve by Julian Fellowes--who mined similar territory and won an Oscar for the screenplay of ""Gosford Park."" Aired on U.S. television stations in four longer parts, this set appropriately reconfigures the program into seven distinct episodes as they were originally intended.Simply put, ""Downton Abbey"" tells the story of one English estate consisting of the Crawley family and their household staff in the years preceding World War I. Fellowes does an incredible job introducing his massive cast. Sometimes when dozens of characters are thrown at you immediately, it takes a while to sort everyone out--but no such problem here. Within the first half hour, I had everything I needed to know about the house dynamic and the role everyone played in it. There are many plot strands threaded throughout the production, but the main drama stems from the fact that the apparent heirs for Downton Abbey are killed on the Titanic. Unable to appoint a female inheritor (the Crawleys have three daughters), a distant and middle-class relative is next in line. When this city lawyer and his mother arrive to become acquainted with the property, the drama starts to unfold.There is a LOT going on in this house--both in the servants quarters and in the master chambers! Some of the plotting is remarkably textured, some a bit far fetched--but there wasn't one moment of ""Downton Abbey"" that wasn't thoroughly entertaining. There is romance, cover-ups, villainy, manipulation, politics, and everything under the sun. Deftly handled by the well balanced screenplay, stories are juggled with dexterity. And almost everyone in the cast gets their moment to shine. Headlined by the terrifically understated Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern, there are far too many great performances to highlight in this brief format. Maggie Smith is, as usual, curmudgeonly perfection! Her battle of wills with Penelope Wilton are pure comic delight. Michelle Dockery, as the eldest daughter, and Dan Stevens, as the new heir apparent, carry much of the story and both are appealing even when they're not very likable (Dockery, in particular, is quite a brat but has the largest character arc). And among the servants, I particularly enjoyed the oily menace of Rob James-Collier who created trouble for the sake of his own amusement.While ""Downton Abbey"" is not without imperfections, I loved it simply in terms of sheer entertainment value. I cared about the characters and wanted to see their stories progress. The series ends rather abruptly (but Season Two is fast on its way) and, in our household, we were sorry to have to say goodbye for now. A grand and funny showcase for some of the year's best performances, this one is a winner!

The acting is phenomenal, Hugh Bonneville shines as the worthy, honorable Lord Crawley, Dame Maggie Smith is spectacular as unchangeable Dowager Countess of Grantham and her chemistry with Penelope Wilton as Isobel Crawley, Matthew Crawley (the heir to Downtown as Lord Crawley has no sons).  These two women provide a lot of the humor and wit of the series and I cannot imagine anyone else in these parts.

1368739,AMAWA346T2D3L,B003WE9C5U,"Le Stryge ""in OZ""","[3, 3]","Bought this series on DVD to avoid having to endure ad breaks so liberally inserted by the commercial channel it was shown on here. This proved an excellent idea as the story itself is very slow to develop. Not that that's such a bad thing, ....indeed a welcome change to the frenetic and raucous quick cutting we have become used to in most TV series shown nowadays, and the snail's pace does give the viewer time to admire the wonderful locations, the exquisitely detailed costumes and set dressing.There are seven episodes, spanning the time between the sinking of the Titanic (1912) and the outbreak of World War One(1914).Okay so they make two short years seem like a decade, BUT life moved slowly back then.The simple narrative is centred on class differences, and the rigid expectations of the ways of behaviour expected, no, demanded of both upstairs and downstairs.The writing, for whom Julian Fellowes is credited, really seems an amalgam of many other familiar stories.There is an absolutely shameless plagiarism of a whole storyline revolving around a rose show that has been entirely stolen in total from the Greer Garson/Walter Pidgeon movie ""Mrs. Miniver"", which is SO barefaced as to be a hanging offence! How Fellowes brazened this out is beyond me!Even the other elements of the Upstairs/Downstairs derived plot line are hardly anything new, but of course this was a wildly popular series, so obviously the audience either didn't realise this wasn't very original storytelling, ...or simply forgave it and sat back to enjoy the undeniably pretty pictures. I certainly thought it visually stunning. The series is reputed to have cost over one million pounds per episode, ...and yes, it shows!The writing also seems to avoid any conflict at all cost. Nothing ever really comes to a head.A women's reputation is threatened with disgrace? It is simply avoided in the end without much being done at all.A new personal valet with a disability is about to be discharged out onto the streets to face miserable poverty? He is reprieved at the very last minute.A self-centred thieving and conniving manservant (the villain!) is due to face very deserved exposure, a dressing down and dismissal which the audience is keen to witness?He resigns to go on to a better job oh-so-conveniently just minutes before this is going to happen, thereby avoiding a ""scene"".A very nasty and bitchy lady's maid causes no end of trouble? She undergoes a biblical-like redemption before discovery.Even any conflicts between the father and his three daughters fizzle out rather than end with Dad putting his foot down, as was the very ingrained mark of the times.I also had problems with the main male protagonist, who we are told was an alcoholic and a very forceful army soldier in his prior life, but suddenly somehow has now inexplicably mutated into an absolute wimp unable or unwilling, (or far too noble?) to stand up for himself at all, despite his silence seeing him facing certain dismissal and total ruin, or even when he becomes the victim of planted incriminating evidence by a person he knows to be the guilty one. With his past such as is later revealed, it's hard to believe such a transformation of a one-time fighting he-man soldier into a meek, mild and ever so humble doormat.All the above having been said, it is one of those Sunday night series that is best enjoyed on a cold winter's evening, on a comfy couch, under a warm rug with a bowl of steaming soup.There's more than enough in the visuals and the great acting, ...with the one very noticeably grating exception of the American wife, who manages to strike a false note. The rest of the entire cast are all exceptional.Worthy of special mention is ""The Butler"", played by the stentorian voiced Charles Carson, who so perfectly catches the nuances of his character from the stuffy formality down to the secret fears of new technology and the need for facades to be maintained at all costs.If it's coming to a commercial TV channel near you, DO buy it on DVD!The insertion of glaring commercials into the already slow storyline will spoil the lush atmosphere and drive you berserk.I would have surely lost interest if forced to endure one episode a week, and those with interruptions every few minutes.The blu-ray version certainly does justice to the lavish locations and costumes.I will also buy the second series now in production.Hopefully Julian Fellowes can resist stealing all the plot lines this time?

Decided to view both Seasons 1 and 2 in order to catch up prior to Season 3 broadcast. Loved every episode and viewed them again. Really refreshing to note how extremely popular it is with today's audiences considering there is so much violent, inferior entertainment.This is such a Masterpiece. The acting is phenomenal! The writing is superlative. The story is provocative. Great acting, writing is top notch. The storylines are extremely compelling. Beautiful scenery, costumes are fabulous,wonderful characters, superb actors.Downton Abbey grabs your attention and never lets go. The characters have me so captivated I don't want it to end. Even the ones you love to hate. The family, the downstairs staff, guests, and relatives are  thrilling! I laughed, I cried. Can't wait for more.There are far too many great performances to highlight them all. Beginning with Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern as Lord and Lady Grantham. He is such a kind, moral individual. Maggie Smith Countess of Grantham is curmudgeon perfection. Her battling with Penelope Wilton (Matthew's Mother) is purely delightful. Michelle Dockery, (Mary) as the eldest daughter, and Dan Stevens, (Matthew) as the new heir, carry much of the story and both are quite appealing. However, the relationship/romance between Brendan Coyle (Lord Grantham's Valet) and Joanne Froggatt (Head House Maid) is a special favorite of mine.There is a lot happening on this estate. Both upstairs and down. There is romance, cover-ups, villainy, manipulation, politics, and everything imaginable.  Never a dull moment, thoroughly entertaining.Did not take me long to purchase both Seasons 1 and 2 (original edition).  The Christmas episode was definitely included. Some customer's stated it was omitted from whatever version they selected. Season 2 only played on my computer not the DVD. Believe it is formatted as dual layer and my DVD is an older model.BTW My friend got hooked as well. She is most definitely very resistant to this type of genre.

Such as Elizabeth McGovern.(a.k.a. Cora Crawley, the Countess of Grantham). This woman can NOT act !!!She plays a &#34;meaty&#34; role&#8230; and does nothing with the character. It's a shame someone else (with talent) was not given this role.If you doubt what I say, watch a few episodes.95% of the time, all she does is make &#34;doe&#34; eyes, or smiles like someone gave her a lobotomy.That said, I can not say enough GOOD things about Maggie Smith. (a.k.a. The Dowager Countess of Grantham).She is such a talented/superb Actress, I doubt the show would survive without her.And, to be fair, the other cast members are GREAT !Regarding another complaint&#8230;..I should point-out that I have only watched 2 seasons so far. (perhaps season 3 will give me what I desire).I thoroughly enjoyed the (excellent acting) and evil scheming between Thomas Barrow and Mrs. Obrien. But, after two seasons of this &#34;evil scheming&#34;&#8230; It's getting &#34;old&#34;.Why? Because we (the audience) are given no &#34;foundation&#34; or &#34;truly meaningful reason&#34; why these two are so hateful.The writers need to give the audience some kind of beliveable explanation. &#34;Resentment&#34; is all the motive I have seen so far, which in my humble opinion, does not explain the depth of their hate.If given a believable reason, I know I would enjoy their &#34;evil scheming&#34; endlessly.And my final critique&#8230;.I thoroughly enjoy the love story between John Bates and Anna Smith&#8230; (and the other topics these two are entwined with).(Both Brendan Coyle and joanne Froggatt are excellent actors)&#8230;But, the ,&#34;I'll-take-anyones-CRAP-because-I-am-an-honorable-man&#34;, attitude of the character John Bates&#8230;. is really starting to irritate me.Perhaps this is because I am an American and I am missing a fundamental &#34;British understanding&#34; of his behavior???I now groan, (with boardom), when &#34;yet-again&#34; he takes &#34;Crap&#34; and does not seek revenge or justice.It sounds like I don't like this show very much. On the contrary, I like it enormously.However, in my mind, if these 3 &#34;flaws&#34; were &#34;repaired&#34;, I would give this show 10 stars instead of 4.",4,"Very Entertaining Show, (with just 3 annoying flaws)",1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,2351,"['Downton', 'Abbey', '34', 'VERY', '34', 'entertaining', 'addictive.it', 'unfortunate', 'wonderful', 'show', 'few', 'VERY', 'annoying', 'components', '8230', 'Such', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern.', 'a.k.a', 'Cora', 'Crawley', 'Countess', 'Grantham', 'woman', 'can', 'NOT', 'act', '34', 'meaty', '34', 'role', '8230', 'nothing', 'character', 'shame', 'someone', 'else', 'talent', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'role.If', 'doubt', 'what', 'say', 'watch', 'few', 'episodes.95', '%', 'time', 'make', '34', 'doe', '34', 'eyes', 'smiles', 'someone', 'gave', 'lobotomy.That', 'said', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'GOOD', 'things', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'a.k.a', 'Dowager', 'Countess', 'Grantham', '.She', 'such', 'talented/superb', 'Actress', 'doubt', 'show', 'would', 'survive', 'her.And', 'be', 'fair', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'GREAT', 'Regarding', 'complaint', '8230', 'should', 'point-out', 'have', 'only', 'watched', '2', 'seasons', 'so', 'far', 'perhaps', 'season', '3', 'will', 'give', 'what', 'desire', '.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'excellent', 'acting', 'evil', 'scheming', 'Thomas', 'Barrow', 'Mrs.', 'Obrien', 'two', 'seasons', '34', 'scheming', '34', '8230', 'getting', '34', 'old', '34', '.Why', 'audience', 'are', 'given', '34', 'foundation', '34', '34', 'truly', 'meaningful', 'reason', '34', 'why', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'hateful.The', 'writers', 'need', 'give', 'audience', 'kind', 'beliveable', 'explanation', '34', 'Resentment', '34', 'motive', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'humble', 'opinion', 'not', 'explain', 'depth', 'hate.If', 'given', 'believable', 'reason', 'know', 'would', 'enjoy', '34', 'scheming', '34', 'endlessly.And', 'final', 'critique', '8230', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'love', 'story', 'John', 'Bates', 'Anna', 'Smith', '8230', 'other', 'topics', 'two', 'are', 'entwined', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'joanne', 'Froggatt', 'are', 'excellent', 'actors', '8230', '34', ""I'll-take-anyones-CRAP-because-I-am-an-honorable-man"", '34', 'attitude', 'character', 'John', 'Bates', '8230', 'really', 'starting', 'irritate', 'me.Perhaps', 'am', 'American', 'am', 'missing', 'fundamental', '34', 'British', 'understanding', '34', 'behavior', 'now', 'groan', 'boardom', 'when', '34', 'yet-again', '34', '34', 'Crap', '34', 'not', 'seek', 'revenge', 'justice.It', 'sounds', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'contrary', 'like', 'enormously.However', 'mind', '3', '34', 'flaws', '34', 'were', '34', 'repaired', '34', 'would', 'give', 'show', '10', 'stars', 'instead', '4']",N/A

The family living there has 3 daughters and no sons so they will not be allowed to keep the estate, The show is very down to Earth for a show like this and is very personable.  The show is set like an Upstairs/Downstairs tale in which both the wealthy family and their servants are given equal screen time.  Two of the sisters, the eldest, who is pushed by the family to marry the next heir to the Abbey wars with her youngest sister, Abigail, a less attractive girl who is jealous of the attention her sister gets and the family's view that Abigail is not marriageable.  Both try to spoil each others marriage prospects in cruel ways.  Downstairs, another set of plotters, the lady's maid, O'Brien and a footman plot to have servants fired and even hurt their employers.

There is romance, intrigue, cunning, not just among the family members but among the staff as well, and even some between these two groups. Expect to find many plot lines which will cross and collide.The intelligent story line has many twists and turns, and often ends with some kind of major event.

When the heir-to-be is killed in the Titanic disaster, in comes solidly middle class lawyer Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) as an unwilling successor, with his feisty, emancipated mother (Penelope Wilton) in tow. Soon speculation and intrigue are rife to save the family inheritance from this upstart, or at least to get him married to Lord Crawley's proud and wilful (yet troubled) eldest daughter.Meanwhile, the servants downstairs are the engine behind several smaller subplots that keep the series moving. Some of these plots may be somewhat unlikely, but they are always entertaining. Here, too, there's a red thread, of a nasty lady's maid and a dashing but evil footman conspiring against Lord Crawley's new valet, Mr. Carson. And of course the upstairs and downstairs people are constantly crossing each others paths, sometimes with surprising or dramatic results.Julian Fellowes has devised a deft scenario that is particularly admirable for its development of several main characters. Some who seem unsympathetic at first truly 'grow up' in the course of the series. Also, he has the courage to end the series on a distinctly muted note. I was less convinced by the seemingly extreme familiarity between some servants and the family (maids entering the earl's library uninvited and without even knocking), nor by some very unlikely coincidences. Mr. Carson does seem a bit too good to be true, and the butler rather an oaf for maintaining in service an obviously double-crossing footman - but these doubts never really interfered with my enjoyment of the whole, which is primarily due to the quality of the acting. The series is set in an interesting period, spanning the years from the sinking of the Titanic to the outbreak of WWI. Highclere Castle, a countrified version of the London Houses of Parliament, is an original choice as Downton Abbey. Costume and detail are exquisite throughout.But the highlight of the series is without a doubt Maggie Smith as Lord Crawley's indomitable mother. Her lines are full of hilarious asides worthy of some formidable Oscar Wilde aunt, and are bound to elicit a few chuckles.",4,Great entertainment for Anglophiles,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,2507,"['luxury', 'version', ""'upstairs"", 'downstairs', 'delight', 'first', 'last', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'costume', 'drama', 'addicts', 'even', 'basic', 'story', 'line', 'may', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'uninvolving', 'Lord', 'Crawley', 'earl', 'Grantham', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'owner', 'Downton', 'estate', 'only', 'three', 'daughters', 'old', 'entail', 'house', 'land', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'inherited', 'man', 'When', 'heir-to-be', 'killed', 'Titanic', 'disaster', 'solidly', 'middle', 'class', 'lawyer', 'Matthew', 'Crawley', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'unwilling', 'successor', 'feisty', 'emancipated', 'mother', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'tow', 'Soon', 'speculation', 'intrigue', 'are', 'rife', 'save', 'family', 'inheritance', 'upstart', 'least', 'get', 'married', 'Lord', 'Crawley', 'proud', 'wilful', 'yet', 'troubled', 'eldest', 'daughter.Meanwhile', 'servants', 'are', 'engine', 'several', 'smaller', 'subplots', 'keep', 'series', 'moving', 'plots', 'may', 'be', 'somewhat', 'unlikely', 'are', 'always', 'entertaining', 'Here', 'too', 'red', 'thread', 'nasty', 'lady', 'maid', 'dashing', 'evil', 'footman', 'conspiring', 'Lord', 'Crawley', 'new', 'valet', 'Mr.', 'Carson', 'course', 'upstairs', 'downstairs', 'people', 'are', 'constantly', 'crossing', 'others', 'paths', 'sometimes', 'surprising', 'dramatic', 'results.Julian', 'Fellowes', 'devised', 'deft', 'scenario', 'particularly', 'admirable', 'development', 'several', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'unsympathetic', 'first', 'truly', ""'grow"", 'up', 'course', 'series', 'Also', 'courage', 'end', 'series', 'distinctly', 'muted', 'note', 'was', 'less', 'convinced', 'seemingly', 'extreme', 'familiarity', 'servants', 'family', 'maids', 'entering', 'earl', 'library', 'uninvited', 'even', 'knocking', 'very', 'unlikely', 'coincidences', 'Mr.', 'Carson', 'seem', 'bit', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'butler', 'rather', 'oaf', 'maintaining', 'service', 'obviously', 'double-crossing', 'footman', 'doubts', 'never', 'really', 'interfered', 'enjoyment', 'whole', 'primarily', 'due', 'quality', 'acting', 'series', 'set', 'interesting', 'period', 'spanning', 'years', 'sinking', 'Titanic', 'outbreak', 'WWI', 'Highclere', 'Castle', 'countrified', 'version', 'London', 'Houses', 'Parliament', 'original', 'choice', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Costume', 'detail', 'are', 'exquisite', 'highlight', 'series', 'doubt', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Lord', 'Crawley', 'indomitable', 'mother', 'lines', 'are', 'full', 'hilarious', 'asides', 'worthy', 'formidable', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'aunt', 'are', 'bound', 'elicit', 'few', 'chuckles']",N/A

1368820,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B003WE9C5U,mirasreviews,"[4, 5]","""Downton Abbey"" is an Edwardian period drama written by Julian Fellowes, who is renowned for his knowledge of Victorian and Edwardian English customs, also on display in ""Gosford Park"" (2001), for which Fellowes won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Fellowes tends to write about manners more than plot, and the relationships between characters that are formed by society's protocols. This might be why ""Downton Abbey"", essentially an Edwardian soap opera, is a better vehicle for Fellowes' talents than ""Gosford Park"". The theatrical film needed a contrived -and poorly structured- murder plot, while the ""Downton Abbey"" miniseries allows the author to do what he does best.The events of the series take place between April 1912 and August 1914, bookended by the sinking of the Titanic and the beginning of World War I. The cast is the aristocratic Crawley family and their domestic staff, who live in the country house Downton Abbey. Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) and his American wife Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) have three grown daughters: Mary (Michelle Dockery), Edith (Laura Carmichael), and Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay). With the untimely deaths of the Earl's first cousin and his son, who was engaged to Mary, a third cousin named Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) becomes the heir to the estate.Matthew is a middle-class solicitor who is proud of his unpretentious ways and has never met his wealthier relations. Lord Grantham invites Matthew and his mother Isobel (Penelope Wilton) to live on the estate so the heir might familiarize himself with the property. Because the law is written so that the Earl's title and his money must both go to the heir, his daughters are left with limited inheritance. The obvious solution would be for Mary to marry the heir, but Mary is stubborn when it comes to suitors. Virtually all of the action within the Crawley family is propelled by the inheritance problem: attempts to separate the money from the title or to find Mary a suitably rich mate.Then there is the action ""downstairs"", among the estate's domestic staff, where we find a scheming ladies' maid (Siobhan Finneran) and footman (Rob James-Collier), a maternal and level-headed housekeeper, Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan), a bright and sensitive head housemaid, Anna (Joanne Froggatt), Gwen (Rose Leslie), an ambitious young housemaid who wants to leave the service to be a secretary, and newcomer John Bates (Brendan Coyle), a wartime acquaintance of Lord Grantham who now serves as his valet. We observe how their positions in the household shape their interactions with each other and with the Crawleys.The characters' role in the household and what that means in a changing world is a central theme, though ""Downton Abbey"" is fairly weak on plot and occasionally far-fetched. The issue of Mary's marriage is in the foreground throughout, but the drama surrounding the dilemma never adds up. Mary would need to marry anyway, so her constant complaining about being pushed into marriage on account of her lost inheritance just doesn't make sense. It's evident that the English are becoming more comfortable with their class-conscious history, as Lord Grantham is portrayed as a bright and moral man, exactly what one would hope of the upper classes. It's worth watching the series for the sharp tongue of the Dowager Countess of Grantham (Maggie Smith) alone. She's hilarious.""Downton Abbey"" first aired on Britain's ITV in seven one-hour episodes. About an hour was cut for American television, where it aired on PBS in four 90-minute installments. It's an enjoyable series as long as you keep in mind that it's about manners. It wasn't intended to have any depth -or any real plot. It's a soap opera with well-spoken characters in a stylish, glamorous setting. But manners say a lot about a culture, and the 1910s were modern enough that modern audiences can understand them while being different enough that we find them pleasantly exotic.

Numerous friends raved about it for several years but I had no interest in checking it out until recently when I had some time on my hands. Four seasons of the show are available now on Amazon Instant Prime video, I began with season 1, episode one and was immediately hooked.The filming, the cinematography of the show is captivating. The style in which it's done, including slow, sweeping pans of the camera from side to side showing the Downton estate and its grounds, brings a majestic quality to the show right from the start. The muted tones and coloring of the scenes make you feel you're viewing a master painting come to life. Beautiful music, at times haunting and melancholy, adds to the feeling of the story, moving it along.  I watch this on my laptop with headphones and am entranced.The costuming in all its detail, hair and clothing, as well as jewelry, shoes, hats, ties and other accessories, is exquisite. It is a continual visual feast.The casting of all characters, from the main ones to even the smallest roles, is phenomenal.  Dame Maggie Smith, oh my gosh!  She is breath-takingly spectacular!  Elizabeth McGovern brings a unique, magical quality to her character of Cora, the countess of Grantham.  Michele Dockery, who plays eldest daughter, Mary, is mesmerizing on screen with her plain and pristine beauty. That's another thing I love about the show: the actors and actresses are all a delight to the eyes, not because they are glamorous but because they are all gorgeous in graceful simplicity and I do mean every one of them.The acting is seamless, you truly feel transported to this era in the early 1900s.

I was totally engrossed in the series, staying up til 5am over 4th of July weekend to finish it because I simply had to know what happened next. If that's not the mark of an engrossing series, I don't know what is. All of the actors were outstanding - I felt as if I had a moment (be it good or bad) with every single character. Mrs. O'Brien and Thomas were the two you loved to hate. I wanted Matthew to reject Mary after her waffling. I was rooting for Edith to land Sir Anthony and was disappointed (but understood that turn about was fair play) when Mary sabotaged this oppportunity. Loved, loved, loved the Dowager Countess and Mrs. Crawley's battle of wills (and honestly, I love Dame Maggie Smith in ANYTHING). Hugh Bonneville was spectacular and on and on. What can I say, just a wonderful treat and I can't wait to see Season 2 - I'm desperate to find out whether Matthew experiences a change of heart, does Mr. Bates finally give in to his feelings for Mary? Does Edith get a second chance with Sir Anthony? Does Mrs. O'Brien continue to die inside from the guilt??

Servants rush to make through the early morning, commenting on newly installed electric lights and quipping at lesser servants. Upstairs, family members wake with leisure and descend the staircase with grace.In the first episode, Robert Crawley, the lord of Downton Abbey and Earl of Grantham, played by Hugh Bonneville, discovers that he must find a new heir. He and his American wife Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) have only three daughters, and his nearest male relative is middle class lawyer Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens). Even the servants realize that this, as one says, is ""more than a shame--it's a complication.""Marvelous acting and a remarkable script bring to life the community of nearly twenty main characters. Bonneville's Robert is the definition of noblesse oblige, old fashioned but benevolent, while McGovern's elegant Cora conveys an American warmth. Michelle Dockery is excellent as Mary, their eldest daughter, who is at turns cruel, charming, and self-deprecating. Laura Carmichael plays Edith, the neglected middle sister, and Jessica Brown-Findlay is the sweet and observant youngest, Sybil.The most hilariously acerbic lines are spoken by Robert's mother Violet. Maggie Smith plays Violet with enough wit to keep her both obnoxious and endearing. Her rival is Matthew's forward thinking Isobel (Penelope Wilton), who is initially less reluctant than her son, snobbish in his own way, to become embroiled in the Earl's family.Butler Mr. Carson (Jim Carter), a fierce defender of Downton's honor, and wise housekeeper Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan) oversee the staff. New valet John Bates's (Brendan Coyle) limp causes a stir, but competent head maid Anna (Joanne Froggatt) is attracted to his kind demeanor. First footman Thomas (Rob James-Collier) dislikes him and seemingly everyone else except his mentor, the manipulative lady's maid Sarah O'Brien (Siobhan Finneran).Gwen the maid (Rose Leslie) hopes to leave service, while the frequently flustered kitchen maid Daisy (Sophie McShera) dreams of pleasing the loud-voiced cook Mrs. Patmore (Lesley Nicol), and second footman William (Thomas Howes) pines for home.Even the most conservative characters are torn between tradition and progress, and the most loathsome have moments of vulnerability and humor. The writing relies on psychological glimpses instead of heavy handed psychoanalysis and is aided by the expressive cast.Downton Abbey is not politically correct. At times, unsavory characters bitterly espouse equality, and minorities are negative figures. We don't see backbreaking alternatives to service or closeups of the scullery maid's calluses. What Downton's lovely visuals lack in grit, the show compensates for in emotional texture. We witness the effects of bad company and resentment as well as good advice and loyalty.This world is both familiar and exotic, making it a fascinating study in personality and culture. Its residents adjust to telephones and cars, but most of them have only a faint idea of impending social change and even less knowledge of the devastation at hand. As that cloud hangs on the horizon, characters are caught up in their own lives, and, for the time being, so are we. There is something intoxicating about getting lost in the intrigues of Downton Abbey.",5,I've given my life to Downton.,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,3806,"['Do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Downton', 'What', 'do', 'think', ""'ve"", 'given', 'life', 'Downton', 'opening', 'image', 'beautifully', 'lit', 'telegraph', 'cuts', 'train', 'barreling', 'audience', 'whistle', 'interrupts', 'Morse', 'code', 'signaling', 'music', 'engine', 'chugs', 'man', 'out', 'window', 'sweeping', 'landscape', 'obscured', 'somewhat', 'steam', 'telegraph', 'poles', 'Set', 'years', 'preceding', 'Great', 'War', 'prevailing', 'theme', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'change.We', 'are', 'soon', 'introduced', 'residents', 'Edwardian', 'manor', 'Servants', 'rush', 'make', 'early', 'morning', 'commenting', 'newly', 'installed', 'electric', 'lights', 'quipping', 'lesser', 'servants', 'Upstairs', 'family', 'members', 'wake', 'leisure', 'descend', 'staircase', 'grace.In', 'first', 'episode', 'Robert', 'Crawley', 'lord', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Earl', 'Grantham', 'played', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'must', 'find', 'new', 'heir', 'American', 'wife', 'Cora', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern', 'have', 'only', 'three', 'daughters', 'nearest', 'male', 'relative', 'middle', 'class', 'lawyer', 'Matthew', 'Crawley', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'Even', 'servants', 'realize', 'one', 'more', 'shame', 'complication', 'Marvelous', 'acting', 'remarkable', 'script', 'bring', 'life', 'community', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'main', 'characters', 'Bonneville', 'Robert', 'definition', 'noblesse', 'oblige', 'old', 'fashioned', 'benevolent', 'McGovern', 'elegant', 'Cora', 'conveys', 'American', 'warmth', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'excellent', 'Mary', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'who', 'turns', 'cruel', 'charming', 'self-deprecating', 'Laura', 'Carmichael', 'Edith', 'neglected', 'middle', 'sister', 'Jessica', 'Brown-Findlay', 'sweet', 'observant', 'youngest', 'Sybil.The', 'most', 'hilariously', 'acerbic', 'lines', 'are', 'spoken', 'Robert', 'mother', 'Violet', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Violet', 'enough', 'wit', 'keep', 'obnoxious', 'endearing', 'rival', 'Matthew', 'forward', 'thinking', 'Isobel', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'who', 'initially', 'less', 'reluctant', 'son', 'snobbish', 'own', 'way', 'become', 'embroiled', 'Earl', 'family.Butler', 'Mr.', 'Carson', 'Jim', 'Carter', 'fierce', 'defender', 'Downton', 'honor', 'wise', 'housekeeper', 'Mrs.', 'Hughes', 'Phyllis', 'Logan', 'oversee', 'staff', 'New', 'valet', 'John', 'Bates', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'limp', 'stir', 'competent', 'head', 'maid', 'Anna', 'Joanne', 'Froggatt', 'attracted', 'kind', 'demeanor', 'First', 'footman', 'Thomas', 'Rob', 'James-Collier', 'seemingly', 'everyone', 'else', 'mentor', 'manipulative', 'lady', 'maid', 'Sarah', ""O'Brien"", 'Siobhan', 'Finneran', '.Gwen', 'maid', 'Rose', 'Leslie', 'leave', 'service', 'frequently', 'flustered', 'kitchen', 'maid', 'Daisy', 'Sophie', 'McShera', 'dreams', 'pleasing', 'loud-voiced', 'cook', 'Mrs.', 'Patmore', 'Lesley', 'Nicol', 'second', 'footman', 'William', 'Thomas', 'Howes', 'pines', 'home.Even', 'most', 'conservative', 'characters', 'are', 'torn', 'tradition', 'progress', 'most', 'loathsome', 'have', 'moments', 'vulnerability', 'humor', 'writing', 'relies', 'psychological', 'glimpses', 'instead', 'heavy', 'handed', 'psychoanalysis', 'aided', 'expressive', 'cast.Downton', 'Abbey', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'times', 'unsavory', 'characters', 'bitterly', 'espouse', 'equality', 'minorities', 'are', 'negative', 'figures', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'backbreaking', 'alternatives', 'service', 'closeups', 'scullery', 'maid', 'calluses', 'What', 'Downton', 'lovely', 'visuals', 'lack', 'grit', 'show', 'emotional', 'texture', 'witness', 'effects', 'bad', 'company', 'resentment', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'advice', 'loyalty.This', 'world', 'familiar', 'exotic', 'making', 'fascinating', 'study', 'personality', 'culture', 'residents', 'adjust', 'telephones', 'cars', 'most', 'have', 'only', 'faint', 'idea', 'impending', 'social', 'change', 'even', 'less', 'knowledge', 'devastation', 'hand', 'cloud', 'hangs', 'horizon', 'characters', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'lives', 'time', 'being', 'so', 'are', 'something', 'intoxicating', 'getting', 'lost', 'intrigues', 'Downton', 'Abbey']",N/A

I know I got the dumbed down PBS version, with about 4 episodes of material cut out because, after all, we Americans are morons and complexity makes us chew on our toes and commit mayhem in the workplace.  I don't care. It's like that boy all your friends think is an idiot and you know is an idiot, but lord, he's so cute.If you enjoy the genre, stories about the privileged people who lived on their fabulous estates, the relationships between those ""upstairs"" and those behind the green baize door in that brief golden period before WWI, you have to love Downton Abbey, even with all its flaws.  We get so little that's good (consider the horrible revival of Upstairs/Downstairs), even the merely mediocre can be a delight.The whole story hinges upon whether Lady Mary Crawley will marry Matthew Crawley. The Crawley estate is,you see, entailed to the oldest living male relative, who happens to be cousin Matthew. She is a fiery beauty...arrogant, bright and stubborn. He is a not so attractive middle-class suburban solicitor of the midlands...the equivalent of an insurance salesman from Bismarck, North Dakota in the 'you make my heart beat faster' scheme of things.You do have to send your brain to wait in the hallway if you're gonna watch. Nothing is true to life.  First of all, the family treats  servants with respect and affection.  Yeah, right. Like that happens. When His Lordship's valet gets into big trouble with the law, is he fired faster than you can say ""no severance pay?"" Nope, Lord Crawley helps the guy marry one of the housemaids, pays for his legal expenses, and testifies in court for the guy.  When cook starts to go blind, do they replace her with another one faster than you can say ""you won't be needing a reference in the workhouse."" Nope. They send her to private hospital and get her the best medical attention money can buy.  When the butler is discovered to have ""A Past,"" the family finds it a jolly good joke.  All is forgiven. Read any memoir by any servant of any era.  See how often that kinda thing happened.  Or look at your own employers. When was the last time the CEO offered to pay your medical bills, send your kids to college and take care of your legal troubles?Anyway, the Crawley Family has its share of ups and downs.  The romance between Matthew and Lady Mary is so rocky, they both get engaged to others at one point. She to a self-made millionaire newspaper publisher who looks and occasionally acts like Snidely Whiplash.  He to a simpering and sincere but not so pretty young woman. The servants get up to all sorts of hijinks, and upstairs and down, there are pregnancies and miscarriages, romances blossom, murders are committed, housemaids are compromised and impregnated, and chauffeurs and daughters elope until one begins to feel grateful for one's own family, where such things only happen every month or two, not every week. Fortunately, no problem except for the question of Mary and Matthew getting together (and that of the murderous valet) takes more than one episode or so to solve. Everyone usually ends up right as rain. Well, except for Cousin Matthew who really takes a beating.First of all, Mary puts the moves on him, solely to get her hands on the title to the estate. Then she backs off, then she comes back, backs off again, and so on. When war breaks out, our Matthew goes off to fight in the trenches, where he has more bad luck than any one man should.  First he goes missing. Then he's dead. Then he's alive again, but engaged to the not-so-hot little blonde.  Then bingo, he's lost again, followed by dead, followed by not dead. But woe unto him, his injury is of a nature that leaves him crippled, confined to a chair and -- dare I say it -- unmannificated. That's right. The Injury That Dare Not Speak Its Name, because they never say it, but from the way Matthew rests his head in his hands and the way that Mary looks at him, we know. Boy, do we know.  And what's worse, the simpering little fiancee swears she'll stick by him anyway.  Oy, this fellow has no luck at all.Anyway, in one of the funniest scenes ever seen on any screen, large or small, Matthew undergoes a miracle.  One minute he's sitting there all wan and unmanned with his fiance. Then she trips and falls. Instinctively, Matthew leaps from the chair to save her and crashes to the floor.  Lying on the carpet, he suddenly looks up heavenward and cries: ""I feel a Tingle.""  Gracious!  Dare we hope it is not just A tingle, but The tingle?  Within moments, His Lordship rounds up the family and the staff, crying ""Here, everyone, you must see this!""  The entire audience (I know I was) is on the edge of their seats waiting to see whatever they are about to reveal.  Turns out, Matthew just gets up out of the wheelchair and walks, but we are given to believe that the miracle cure was sufficient to, you know, fix stuff, because shortly afterwards he is seen dancing with Mary and flirting his fool head off, something an unmannificated man would not do.  Not an English one, anyway.Well, given that he still has feelings for Mary who now has feelings for him, and given that everyone can now feel their feelings, and are feeling quite frisky as a result, Matthew would be in quite the pickle, all able bodied but still lumbered with Miss Got No Rocks. Fortunately we get yet another unexpected visitor: Influenza and out flies the Fiancee, another victim of the epidemic.Yeah, I know it sounds silly. And when you look too closely, there is no reason to love Downton Abbey. It's unrealistic, the people upstairs are inane, the servants are the happiest lot of domestic workers on the planet.  We have a cook who is not a shrew and who mentors the scullery maid instead of thwacking her with the spatula.  The housekeeper is a jewel of selflessness who gives up marriage and a life of her own to thrill vicariously to the events Upstairs.  The butler adores the family to the point where, even when he is sick to the point of death, he insists on serving the port.  This is a guy who dreams of crawling over broken glass to fetch the morning paper for his Lordship. Even the murdering valet smiles in the face of adversity to the point where you want to kick him in his bad leg.  The only bad characters are a truly psychotic but oddly loyal lady's maid and a devious but inept footman.  But except for one really, really bad thing done by the maid, they don't do much beyond plotting.So why love it?  Well, for one thing, Maggie Smith.  She is so good as the Dowager Lady Crawley, and her dialogue is so witty, it belongs in a different mini-series.  It's worth the effort of watching just for her moments.  And it's fun. No, there is nothing to be gleaned here, you won't get a history lesson...although the attention paid to the period costumes is excellent and of itself another good reason for watching. (One wonderfully realistic note: the characters repeat their costumes. The 3 sisters have their 'good dresses' that they wear on important occasions, and everyday outfits are repeated frequently.)  But it's true, Downton Abbey doesn't give us anything close to real-life situations. But who needs real life. Don't we get enough of that in real life?  Suspend your disbelief, pour some sherry (okay, a lot of sherry--break out that Bucket o' Sherry you were saving for an emergency) and just enjoy.  There, that's not so hard, is it.(Just like that cute but brainless boy, there is a time and a place for everything. Next week you can dig out ""Life in the English Country House: A Social and Architectural History"" by Mark Girouard...or even better, ""Wait for Me!: Memoirs by Deborah Vivien Freeman-Mitford Cavendish Duchess of Devonshire.""  Almost as much fun and she doesn't make up nearly as much stuff as the writers of Downton Abbey.)",5,I don't know why I love you like I do. I don't know why.

Harvey ""Mystery Writer""","[1, 1]","When I first heard of the television mini series of ""Downton Abbey, I said to myself, ""Oh no, not another rendition of a subject area that has already been revisited to death. I did not make a point to watch this program on PBS but saw clips from the web site ""You Tube"" and I must admit, the clips were quite interesting. The first thing I noticed was that the writing was superb. The second thing I noticed was the costumes were absolutely beautiful and the third thing was everyone spoke the king's English. That fact in itself was refreshing. Julian Fellowes, the writer and executive producer did an excellent job of weaving into the plot and explaining the hideous laws of Britain pertaining to the estate entailment. It is quite obvious that Mr. Fellowes is adept with this particular environment and he depicts this world very well. The scene which captured my memory was the scene where Lord Grantham is trying to negotiate a price  to a young Duke so he can marry Mary, his oldest girl. Its quite obvious that aristocratic men with daughters who could not inherit the estate were seen as barter for men- almost to the level of prostitution. I find the whole British entailment system quite barbaric yet these no money titled men flourished by obtaining rich heiresses from the United States. I simply could not understand why a woman would give up her entire fortune just to marry some impoverished Duke  but then there it is. That is exactly what happened. I bought the DVDs and I am not sorry but I am disgusted with the edited versions done by PBS. I can tell where they chopped a scene out because there were some continuity and transitional issues. I understand Rebecca Eaton made the decision to cut scenes because she thinks Americans don't have the attention span for such elongated scenes.

1368900,A1AISB4FU33CNY,B003WE9C5U,Price Grisham,"[10, 14]","At first I tried to overlook Downton Abbey's resemblance to Upstairs Downstairs--even after another homosexual footman became infatuated with the duke, and another eldest daughter was headstrong and rebellious. One suspects there were plenty of both in the Edwardian era; but I did reluctantly downgrade the rating after the flower show storyline. Although sparkingly portrayed, perhaps even better than the original, the scene unfortunately was too direct a duplicate from the Mrs. Miniver movie.In addition, there were unconvincing aspects in the same script, the first key to the plot: It is hard to believe that Lady Mary would not have screamed her head off if a Turkish diplommt had really broken into her room, her bed, and her virginity (and WHY did Lady Mary answer ""No"" when her mother asked if he had forced himself, which he so obviously HAD? It wasn't as if she had broken into HIS room).Moreover, Matthew, the several-times removed cousin, though middle-class, would surely not have been so clueless about the manners and ways of the aristocracy when he arrives at Downton (though he does improve): He is the university-educated son of a respected physician, not a green grocer (despite what the Dowager Countess thinks; and by the way, wouldn't YOU stand if that intrepid and titled lady were your grandmother and she entered the room? Yet none of the younger women do when she is announced during tea).In addition, the role of Edith was, frankly, confusing (through no fault of the excellent actress): She's rather a sympathetic character at first, then turns suddenly into a vicious, green (with envy) monster who calmly reveals her sister's scandal--but standards hadn't changed THAT much since Austen's day, and Edith must have realized that she and her entire family would be socially tainted, just as all the Bennets were by Lydia's misbehavior.Maggie Smith, of course, gets it hilariously and exactly right every single time and (metaphorically) steals every scene. As a matter of fact, the entire cast's stunningly superior acting, the detailed and accurate(!)costumes, and the very beautiful estate (though never an Abbey, that part of the title should have been dropped), keep Downton from sinking into mere soap opera. All in all, even though the plot sometimes seems cut from other works and pasted together with melodrama, the series is extremely enjoyable and certainly still worth the purchase--but Edwardian subtlety is not its strong suit.",3,"Brilliant acting, somewhat marred by copied scenes, puzzling behavior",1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,2471,"['first', 'tried', 'overlook', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'resemblance', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'even', 'homosexual', 'footman', 'became', 'infatuated', 'duke', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'was', 'headstrong', 'rebellious', 'One', 'were', 'plenty', 'Edwardian', 'era', 'did', 'reluctantly', 'downgrade', 'rating', 'flower', 'show', 'storyline', 'sparkingly', 'portrayed', 'perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'original', 'scene', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'too', 'direct', 'duplicate', 'Mrs.', 'Miniver', 'addition', 'were', 'unconvincing', 'aspects', 'same', 'script', 'first', 'key', 'plot', 'hard', 'believe', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'screamed', 'head', 'Turkish', 'diplommt', 'had', 'really', 'broken', 'room', 'bed', 'virginity', 'WHY', 'did', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'No', 'when', 'mother', 'asked', 'had', 'forced', 'so', 'obviously', 'HAD', 'was', ""n't"", 'had', 'broken', 'HIS', 'room', '.Moreover', 'Matthew', 'several-times', 'removed', 'cousin', 'middle-class', 'would', 'surely', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'clueless', 'manners', 'ways', 'aristocracy', 'when', 'Downton', 'improve', 'university-educated', 'son', 'respected', 'physician', 'not', 'green', 'grocer', 'what', 'Dowager', 'Countess', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'YOU', 'stand', 'intrepid', 'titled', 'lady', 'were', 'grandmother', 'entered', 'room', 'none', 'younger', 'women', 'do', 'when', 'announced', 'tea', '.In', 'addition', 'role', 'Edith', 'was', 'frankly', 'confusing', 'fault', 'excellent', 'actress', 'rather', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'first', 'then', 'suddenly', 'vicious', 'green', 'envy', 'monster', 'who', 'sister', 'scandal', 'standards', 'had', ""n't"", 'changed', 'THAT', 'much', 'Austen', 'day', 'Edith', 'must', 'have', 'realized', 'entire', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'socially', 'tainted', 'just', 'Bennets', 'were', 'Lydia', 'misbehavior.Maggie', 'Smith', 'course', 'hilariously', 'exactly', 'right', 'single', 'time', 'metaphorically', 'steals', 'scene', 'matter', 'fact', 'entire', 'cast', 'stunningly', 'superior', 'acting', 'detailed', 'accurate', 'costumes', 'very', 'beautiful', 'estate', 'never', 'Abbey', 'part', 'title', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'dropped', 'keep', 'Downton', 'sinking', 'mere', 'soap', 'opera', 'even', 'plot', 'sometimes', 'cut', 'other', 'works', 'pasted', 'together', 'melodrama', 'series', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'certainly', 'still', 'purchase', 'Edwardian', 'subtlety', 'not', 'strong', 'suit']",N/A

This is 6 hours of engrossing television involving the goings on in a stately home in the years preceding World War 1. Though it is only 6 hours, one of it's strengths is that it introduces some 18 major characters and by the end of the show, you have an intimate knowledge and a strong like (or dislike) of each of the cast. A rich man, his American wife and their three daughters occupy the home with a cast of varied butlers, footmen, house maids, cooks, valet and the like gabbing and in some cases conspiring to reach their own goals.The key of the story revolves around the fact that only a male heir can inherit the property and the riches that go with it and since there are three daughters, that presents a problem and key plot point.Maggie Smith manages to command the screen in each of her appearances as the dowager Countess and she has some lines that are simply classic. With that being said, there is not one actor who does not truly occupy their role with great skill.Keep in mind this is a show that airs at 9 PM and is not intended for little ones. It avoids violence and language but does include sex, death, conspiracy and some scenes that recreate an era where women were seeking the vote in Great Britain and were met with some rough opposition.The home itself is a wonder to behold and it is truly a key part of the story as the delineation between servants and masters is quite evident in the period detail.Twists and turns abound throughout this magnificently acted drama and all the way up to the final line of the final episode I was glued to the screen. This is a 3 DVD set divided into 7 episodes as compared to the PBS show divided into 4. I bought the DVD because I was so captivated by Episode 1 on PBS that I didn't want to wait another 3 weeks to see the rest. I'm so glad I did. And my major complaint? I have to wait a year to see the continuation of the story?? Based upon the way this story ended, there is plenty more great stuff to come out of Downton Abbey.

The news of this event is of utmost importance to the Earl, because it leaves him without an heir to Downton. Because the Earl has three daughters, the heir of Downton was to have been his nearest male relative, his cousin James. James and his son both died on the Titanic.This season is filled with beauty, as the viewer enjoys the magnificent photography of this estate. Each scene is effectively planned and filmed. A cast of incredibly talented actors who make the storyline come alive, presents the plot realistically. Everything is extravagant here: the accurate and lavish period costumes, the lush surroundings, the true-to-life characters, and the breathtakingly beautiful soundtrack.Even the script is amazing! Sometimes the characters utter priceless words of advice and wisdom, giving the audience tidbits of thought worthy of further contemplation. At other times, they are quick-witted utterances that make the viewer say, ""Did I just hear that right?""The storyline flies along as the viewer is whisked between the action among the family members and the separate but connected world of the servants.

Peterson,"[2, 3]","General plot:English Lord and Lady have 3 daughters, live in a castle, have a large staff of servants, and are ready to lose it all as they have no male heir.Comments:All events told from a liberal point-of-view in a such a way that a lot of young liberals would think it is fact--like Schindler's List or something. It is clear that liberals want to revise history through this soap opera by putting a handicapped person in the story, a Muslim lover, a gay guy, a feminist or two, etc. They even hinge their entire story line around some made up ""war on women"" plot line failing to mention Queen Victoria, Queen Elizabeth, Lady Jane Grey, Queen Mary I, Queen Mary II, Queen Anne,  etc. They also write the story so that the servants are fraternizing and socializing etc with the family . . .like they are all one big extended family. They throw the word ""socialism"" around like it is a positive thing. They even write ""socialistic causes"" into the story line like socialism what you are to aspire to all the while mentioning how this or that person has done well for him/herself in getting a better paying/more important job like socialism and capitalism can co-exist.  And if all of the above is not enough to prod you to save your $10 they throw a Muslim in who is sleeping around with the eldest daughter unmarried. They are even groping each other and slobbering all over each other in a room by themselves apart from their family in one scene. You have kids behaving like 1990s/2000s kids in the way that they talk to their parents. It is kind of a joke to anyone that isn't corrupted by liberal mind control.Also, like I have written in other such ""English"" movies and TV shows, the writers have to kiss up to the American audiences to strike it rich by throwing an American in the mix and lines to stroke the American ego etc. It is patronizing and sickening.This show reminds me of Falcon Crest or Knots Landing soap operas. The writers set up the conservatives as outdated, evil, mean and just inhumane--the villains. They set up up the liberals with their liberal story lines as victims, do gooders, just, compassionate people just fighting to do the right thing. Only this show blurs the line between conservative and liberal, tilting all of the conservatives to moderate and labeling them ""conservative"". It is just a disaster.This show is nothing but modern trash TV wrapped in an old appearance/setting. They dress the part. They live in the castle. But they are always snipping at each other and putting each other down with little petty, childish remarks, even the servants--even the ones you are supposed to like. They back stab and lie. They even murder to get what they want. None of the characters are likable. Not the matriach. Not the Lady and Lord. Most of the servants but the one blond guy whose mother dies although you don't get enough of him from the story line -- shocker.

As it stands, a distant cousin is next in line but he is not considered to be an equal amongst the upper-class family. He and his mother are brought up to live at the Abbey and from there things get interesting. Meanwhile, in the lower areas of the house, the servants work hard and gossip even harder. They provide very interesting conversations and their part is no less important than the Lords and Ladies of the house. The series is comprised of mostly unrecognizable actors, who all do a marvelous job, and of course, Dame Maggie Smith who plays snooty like noone else can. The period details are truly first-rate. The costumes are just lovely and very detail-oriented, the scenery and buildings and props have a very authentic look and the musical score is subtle but very nice.

The couple have three adult daughters i.e. vain and beautiful Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), bitter Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael), and idealistic Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay). The Dowager Countess Grantham, the Earl's mother is played by the incomparable Dame Maggie Smith.The drama begins with the Earl receiving some troubling news - his cousin (his heir-to-be) and the cousin's heir are both reported dead following the sinking of the Titanic. The cousin's son was engaged to be married to Lady Mary, but Mary takes the news with surprising calm, having not been in love with the man in the first place. This was to have been a marriage of convenience, to secure the family home and fortune for the girls. Now, the Earl and Countess have to face the unpalatable fact that they may lose everything upon the Earl's death - the estate is to be inherited by a young solicitor, Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) who takes up residence (at the Earl's insistence) with his mother in a nearby manor house.The drama does not only revolve around the Grantham's but also involves the staff that work at Downton Abbey. The Earl employs a new valet, John Bates (Brendan Coyle, who used to be a major character in another period drama, Lark Rise to Candleford). There's lots of politics among the staff 'downstairs' - there's the stern but fair butler, Charles Carson (Jim Carter), Mrs. Hughes the housekeeper (Phyllis Logan), the malicious and mean-spirited lady's maid Sarah (Siobhan Finneran), and ambitious first footman Thomas (Rob James-Collier).As the story progresses, viewers find there are many skeletons lurking in the closets of these characters - many seem to have a past they'd rather forget and keep secret. Lady Mary falls in lust for a Turkish diplomat when he visits the Abbey for a brief visit, a visit which triggers some truly remarkable events. There's plenty of conflict and tension in this show, enough to keep viewers' interest engaged.
