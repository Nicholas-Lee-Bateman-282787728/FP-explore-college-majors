If only LionsGate would do this with their 2005 Hercules movie (I wrote a review, but I've been reading conflicting reports as to which version is on the DVD).  But the main question is: is the movie worth watching in the first place?  The answer is Yes and No.Yes: It's an interesting angle as to how the ship it capsized (terrorists isntead of a tidal wave).  Also, even though it's not as big-budget as the original or the Summer 2006 remake, it's got fairly decent effects where necessary.  The characters are more or less the same, some are expanded, some don't die like in the original, and there's several new characters.  And you've got Alex Kingston acting again!  Nothing says good movie like Alex Kingston.No: It's a shoddy attempt to cash in on both the original and the remake.  The characters are poor imitations of its 1972 counterpart and the new ones just aren't interesting enough to care about.  The massage girl, for example.

966582,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B000E1YW22,Andrew Raker,"[0, 0]","Having watched all three major Poseidon films, I have to say that ""The Poseidon Adventure"" starring Gene Hackman is the best overall film. However, this film is probably slightly more realistic.The 2006 ""Poseidon"" starring Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell is the worst of the three. (I gave it 1 star because I had to. I would have given it 0 if I could have.)  Given, the 2006 ""Poseidon"" utilized the best special effects. However, the acting and music  are VERY poorly created and hardly realistic at all.This 2005 Hallmark ""The Poseidon Adventure"" utilized a terrorist attack rather than an event of nature, i.e. an earthquake or rogue wave, which are the calamities in the other two versions.Unfortunately, this film could have been an excellent 5-star film if (1) It was not so anti-American military. In this film, the U.S. military it treated like a bunch of six year olds who cannot do anything right, and (2) A few scenes late in the film are very unrealistic. People who may soon die are not likely to spend 14 minutes crossing a metal bridge with fiery water beneath them. Also, they are likely to craw across rather than walk. Knowing the ship will sink, the long, drawn-out dialogue and fear of falling off the bridge (when the real fear was sinking with the ship) must seem inappropriate.As a whole, this film is more realistic partly because its low budget made some of the heavily action sequences (a race against the water) impossible. In fact, the ship does not really start sinking until the end, and then it completely sinks. (It is much more like the sinking scene in James Cameron's Titanic - although not quite so elaborate.)Overall, I thought the acting was pretty well done. No one substitutes for Gene Hackman in my opinion. Yet, I believe the acting in this Hallmark ""The Poseidon Adventure"" was just as good, if not better, than in the 2006 ""Poseidon,"" which I believe is a sorry excuse for a movie.",3,A Few Scenes Harm this Film,1219276800,"08 21, 2008",2008,1922,"['Having', 'watched', 'three', 'major', 'Poseidon', 'films', 'have', 'say', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'starring', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'best', 'overall', 'film', 'However', 'film', 'probably', 'slightly', 'more', 'realistic.The', '2006', 'Poseidon', 'starring', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'worst', 'three', 'gave', '1', 'star', 'had', 'would', 'have', 'given', '0', 'could', 'have', 'Given', '2006', 'Poseidon', 'utilized', 'best', 'special', 'effects', 'However', 'acting', 'music', 'are', 'VERY', 'poorly', 'created', 'hardly', 'realistic', 'all.This', '2005', 'Hallmark', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'utilized', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'rather', 'event', 'nature', 'i.e', 'earthquake', 'rogue', 'wave', 'are', 'calamities', 'other', 'two', 'versions.Unfortunately', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', '5-star', 'film', '1', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'anti-American', 'military', 'film', 'U.S.', 'military', 'treated', 'bunch', 'six', 'year', 'olds', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'right', '2', 'few', 'scenes', 'late', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'People', 'who', 'may', 'soon', 'die', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'spend', '14', 'minutes', 'crossing', 'metal', 'bridge', 'fiery', 'water', 'beneath', 'Also', 'are', 'likely', 'craw', 'rather', 'walk', 'Knowing', 'ship', 'will', 'sink', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'dialogue', 'fear', 'falling', 'off', 'bridge', 'when', 'real', 'fear', 'was', 'sinking', 'ship', 'must', 'seem', 'inappropriate.As', 'whole', 'film', 'more', 'realistic', 'partly', 'low', 'budget', 'made', 'heavily', 'action', 'sequences', 'race', 'water', 'impossible', 'fact', 'ship', 'not', 'really', 'start', 'sinking', 'end', 'then', 'completely', 'much', 'more', 'sinking', 'scene', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Titanic', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'elaborate', 'Overall', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'opinion', 'believe', 'acting', 'Hallmark', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', '2006', 'Poseidon', 'believe', 'sorry', 'excuse', 'movie']",N/A

NO, it's a bad remake of a classic disaster film.32  years later, Hallmark Entertainment tries to do a mini series of the Poseidon with modern day updates. Instead of a tidal wave, it is a bomb that inverts the ship upside down. The cop character is now a homeland security agent (Adam Baldwin) dragging a terrorist through the wreckage of the ship to justice. The priest is now a Bishop (Rutger Hauer).  The Red Button character from the first movie, now played by Bryan Brown, is now married to singer, an International Idol  pop star. The smart kid from the first film is now a junior Speilburg with a video cam that  never runs out of battery  life. The young girl (Pamela Sue Martin character in the first film) is now the daughter of Steve Guttenberg, a cheating family man who is headed for divorce. Peter Weller is the Captain who character name is the same as the original book's author (Paul Gallico)...a nice touch! You can not fault the actors, they do the best they can with this material..one would blame the script writer who could not make this chestnut revised  without treading too close of repeating  the deepness of the originalThere are a few additions to the remake that does not make this sail any better. Alex (ER) Kingston is a sort of federal international rescue head, the role seem so added at the last minute. A ship's doctor (C. Thomas Howell) who reminds me of DR Bricker from Love Boat.However, this watered down soap opera is not better than the original in a longer form...in many ways it drags down the audience in this watered down version.  In someways, it seem like a  LOVE BOAT episode with dramatic melodrama and adventure added in the mix. If you saw the first, most of the same things happen with  few changes. The last  shot is the ship sinking..THANK GOD NO SEQUAL!So you want that sinking feeling again,  get the originally 1972 film with Gene Hackman, Red  Button, Shelly Winters, Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens.The Poseidon Adventure (Special Edition).

A cruise ship that sets sail from Cape Town, South Africa to Sydney, Australia gets overturned by a terrorist bomb. A small band of survivors do their best to make it to safety before the ship sinks. Directed by John Putch, the movie stars: Steve Guttenberg, Adam Baldwin, C. Thomas Howell, Peter Weller, Rutger Hauer, and Bryan Brown. In this adaptation, the plot differs from the original book and first feature film in that the ship is overturned by a terrorist bomb and not a tidal wave. The story was altered because the makers of the film felt that the original's disaster was unrealistic and people wouldn't believe the premise.Even though this film has generally received less than favorable reviews from TV critics and viewers, I thought the movie was pretty good myself. For it to be made on such a modest budget, it certainly delivered the goods as a 'reinvention' of the classic written by Paul Gallico. I'll agree, the original is-by far- the best movie out of them all as it stays true to the novel in almost every respect. However, on its' own merits, this movie is just as good. It kept my attention throughout the movie and never once wained that attention. Course, with Amber Sainsbury in the movie as Shelby Clarke, it's hard to look away(whew!-is it hot in here or is it me?).

What it is, is a fair television remake that has beeen updated for the 2000's (terrorists and bomb explosions replace the tidal wave) that has some moments of suspense.The negatives include some of the CGI of the Poseidon (not very convincing) and some of the sets which really dont look like a 135 000ton upside ocean liner. Bryce Zabel (screenplay) has unwisely dispensed with some of the characters, whilst including others...theres no Linda Rogo...Manny Rosen is now dead (Sylvia Syms as Belle Rosen is miscast and her constant ""My Manny..."" is highly irritating). The Clarke family is obviously The Shelby family from the novel and thats a nice addition. But perhaps Mr Bryce should have used the original novel as basis for his screenplay...it would have been perfect for a 4 hour two part miniseries.Much of the tension is removed by going to scenes which show the rescue attempts...although they are well handled, and I actually didnt mind them...Much has been written about 'it not being' realistic for the ship to turn over based on a hole...so I'm not going to go there...suffice to say that the capsize sequence is well done for television movie.It was also nice to see beautiful Cape Town as the place where the Poseidon sails from and also to be able to recognise many local actors in this movie which was filmed here in South Africa.As a tribute to the original it is only okay...but taken on its own Hallmark's Poseidon Adventure is passable fair for a rainy afternoon.",2,Passable television remake perfect for rainy afternoon,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,1938,"['bad', 'reviews', 'here', 'AMAZON', 'elsewhere', 'television', 'remake', 'time', 'favourite', 'movie', 'THE', 'HOLY', 'GRAIL', 'disaster', 'movies', 'made', 'highly', 'reticent', 'watch', 'So', 'one', 'year', 'first', 'screening', 'seeing', 'dissapointing', 'visually', 'spectacular', 'big', 'screen', 'remake', 'have', 'finally', 'managed', 'view', 'one.Ok', 'first', 'off', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'reviewers', 'would', 'have', 'believe', '.but', 'then', 'not', 'great', 'What', 'fair', 'television', 'remake', 'beeen', 'updated', '2000', 'terrorists', 'bomb', 'explosions', 'replace', 'tidal', 'wave', 'moments', 'suspense.The', 'negatives', 'include', 'CGI', 'Poseidon', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'sets', 'really', 'look', '135', '000ton', 'upside', 'ocean', 'liner', 'Bryce', 'Zabel', 'screenplay', 'unwisely', 'dispensed', 'characters', 'whilst', 'including', 'others', 'Linda', 'Rogo', 'Manny', 'Rosen', 'now', 'dead', 'Sylvia', 'Syms', 'Belle', 'Rosen', 'miscast', 'constant', 'Manny', 'highly', 'irritating', 'Clarke', 'family', 'obviously', 'Shelby', 'family', 'novel', 'nice', 'addition', 'perhaps', 'Mr', 'Bryce', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'original', 'novel', 'basis', 'screenplay', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', '4', 'hour', 'two', 'part', 'miniseries.Much', 'tension', 'removed', 'going', 'scenes', 'show', 'rescue', 'attempts', 'are', 'well', 'handled', 'actually', 'didnt', 'mind', 'Much', 'been', 'written', 'not', 'being', 'realistic', 'ship', 'turn', 'over', 'based', 'hole', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'there', 'suffice', 'say', 'capsize', 'sequence', 'well', 'done', 'television', 'movie.It', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'beautiful', 'Cape', 'Town', 'place', 'where', 'Poseidon', 'sails', 'also', 'be', 'able', 'recognise', 'many', 'local', 'actors', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'here', 'South', 'Africa.As', 'tribute', 'original', 'only', 'okay', 'taken', 'own', 'Hallmark', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'passable', 'fair', 'rainy', 'afternoon']",N/A

So, does this version offer anything the other two didn't (or did) in a better (or worse) way?  I'm forced to say this doesn't improve on the original (or interfere with the remake).  It's a run-of-the-mill repeat with lesser stars, dragged down by the unrelenting sense that no one really cared about what they were doing.  Even the score is limp, no attempt to jazz up the tension or add to the excitement.  This was made for television so everything was watered down (no pun intended), even when they discover a body burned beyond recognition.  Ho hum, just another body.At least it's in widescreen!  Not that it made much of a difference to the plot (poorly utilizing an act of terrorism to get things rolling).  I suppose you have to admire their willingness to risk scorn for using a bomb...in a bomb.  It was not an element that really added to the story; there was plenty of drama already there.  The addition of the doctor (C. Thomas Howell) also didn't bring anything fresh to the plot (other than a reunion with his The Hitcher costar, Rutger Hauer).  But I suppose they needed to kill time, they just didn't need to be so obvious about it (as with their lame attempt to heighten the suspense through a shrill performance by Alex Kingston; added at the last moment for no good reason).This just didn't have the impact required to make it stand out.

966595,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B000E1YW22,Ian,"[4, 6]","While one may question releasing a remake of the first Poseidon adventure mere months before another remake comes out, I was pleasantly suprised when I watched this after renting it at my local Blockbuster store.The movie follows the original Poseidon adventure fairly closely.  On new years eve a giant ocean liner capsizes and several passengers struggle to survive and escape before the ship goes under.  What's new in this version is that instead of a giant tidal wave, we have some crazy terrorists who blow a hole in the ship, causing it to take water and quickly capsize during a rough storm.The movie is basically the same as the original, though there are some noticable differences.  While the main charachter in the original was the priest, the main stars in this movie are a family who's going through some rough times as the parents try to keep thier marriage together.  We've got a homeland security agent who tries to keep the ship safe (but as you can guess, doesn't succed), and the fact that the outside world is racing to save the ship before it sinks.Several charachters from the original return here, such as the kids, Mrs. Rosen, the minister, the steward, while some charachters don't return (Mrs. Rosen's husband is gone, so she's a widow), and some get new roles (Rogo is now a homeland security officer undercover as an off-duty policeman).  For the most part I think the charachters worked fairly well.  There are some good moments between them, such as one of the stewards acting as a vampire for the boy's movie (which he's constantly filming throughout the entire film).  The minister, who was a bit angry in the original, is now more calm, friendly, and focused in this remake (which I like).  The acting is, on the whole, above average for a made for TV movie.  None of the charachters felt overly weak or overly good.  Just acceptable, average acting with some good parts.  If I really had to point somebody out, it would be the boy, who is constantly filming the disaster with his video camera (and working in tandem with a guy who wants to buy the footage and turn it into a TV drama).  Although it was an interesting idea that he's trying to make a movie out of the events around him, I found it to be irritating and annoying.The real star of this movie is, predictably, the special effects.  While not ILM or WETA quality, the special effects of the ship are actually quite impressive.  There were a few shots where I found myself thinking ""Is that a real ship?"".  The turn over sequence in paticular, where the ship capsizes, is excellently done and had my attention throughout the entire scene.  The sets are also well done, conveying the sense of an upside down sinking ship very well.However, the aspect of the movie that needed the most attention was the suspense.  In short, there really wasn't any.  The only real suspense I got was wondering who was going to die, though one can get a good idea by focusing hard enough.  When a charachter does die, it's usually quick in the manner of ""Oh no!...Let's move on.""  In the original, the charachters are constantly scrambling to stay ahead of the rising water.  Here, there's hardly any water chasing after them, meaning that they have plenty of time to keep going.  The only real sinking comes in at the last minute.  One quick note is that while the rescuers are constantly saying that the ship is going under, it stays perfectly level during the climax of the movie, and for some reason satalite images show the bow going under.  There is some suspense in the movie, but there's very little of it.lastly, the main topic of the movie (the family trying to stay together) just dosn't work well.  The mom and dad argue, then the dad eventually goes off to have an affair with another woman, then works to coming back to his family after the ship turns over so he can finally see that family is what matters etc.  It sounds really good on paper, but it does not work very well here.There's also some morality points brought up, such as why do terrorists want to kill people, having an affair is bad, etc.  There's a very symbolic sequence involving fire near the end of the movie where it is very obvious that those who are not exactly saints are going to get barbecued (though i'd say that the second victim really diddn't deserve to die).  Take that low moral values!Overall, i'd recommend this movie for the special effects, the sets, and the interest of seeing who lives and who dies compared to the original movie (some of the charachters who died live in this version).  It takes some good ideas and some modern day questions, trying to work them into a classic disaster story and for the most part at least pulling it halfway off.  I'd say that it's at least worth a rental.",3,I enjoyed it,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,4770,"['one', 'may', 'question', 'releasing', 'remake', 'first', 'Poseidon', 'adventure', 'mere', 'months', 'remake', 'out', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'suprised', 'when', 'watched', 'renting', 'local', 'Blockbuster', 'store.The', 'movie', 'original', 'Poseidon', 'adventure', 'fairly', 'closely', 'new', 'years', 'eve', 'giant', 'ocean', 'liner', 'capsizes', 'several', 'passengers', 'struggle', 'survive', 'escape', 'ship', 'What', 'new', 'version', 'instead', 'giant', 'tidal', 'wave', 'have', 'crazy', 'terrorists', 'who', 'blow', 'hole', 'ship', 'causing', 'take', 'water', 'quickly', 'capsize', 'rough', 'storm.The', 'movie', 'basically', 'same', 'original', 'are', 'noticable', 'differences', 'main', 'charachter', 'original', 'was', 'priest', 'main', 'stars', 'movie', 'are', 'family', 'who', 'going', 'rough', 'times', 'parents', 'try', 'keep', 'thier', 'marriage', 'together', ""'ve"", 'got', 'homeland', 'security', 'agent', 'who', 'keep', 'ship', 'safe', 'can', 'guess', ""n't"", 'succed', 'fact', 'outside', 'world', 'racing', 'save', 'ship', 'sinks.Several', 'charachters', 'original', 'return', 'here', 'such', 'kids', 'Mrs.', 'Rosen', 'minister', 'steward', 'charachters', 'do', ""n't"", 'return', 'Mrs.', 'Rosen', 'husband', 'gone', 'widow', 'get', 'new', 'roles', 'Rogo', 'now', 'homeland', 'security', 'officer', 'undercover', 'off-duty', 'policeman', 'most', 'part', 'think', 'charachters', 'worked', 'fairly', 'well', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'such', 'one', 'stewards', 'acting', 'vampire', 'boy', 'movie', 'constantly', 'filming', 'entire', 'film', 'minister', 'who', 'was', 'bit', 'angry', 'original', 'now', 'more', 'calm', 'friendly', 'focused', 'remake', 'like', 'acting', 'whole', 'average', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'None', 'charachters', 'felt', 'overly', 'weak', 'overly', 'good', 'Just', 'acceptable', 'average', 'acting', 'good', 'parts', 'really', 'had', 'point', 'somebody', 'would', 'be', 'boy', 'who', 'constantly', 'filming', 'disaster', 'video', 'camera', 'working', 'tandem', 'guy', 'who', 'buy', 'footage', 'turn', 'TV', 'drama', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'trying', 'make', 'movie', 'events', 'found', 'be', 'irritating', 'annoying.The', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'predictably', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'ILM', 'WETA', 'quality', 'special', 'effects', 'ship', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'impressive', 'were', 'few', 'shots', 'where', 'found', 'thinking', 'real', 'ship', 'turn', 'over', 'sequence', 'paticular', 'where', 'ship', 'capsizes', 'excellently', 'done', 'had', 'attention', 'entire', 'scene', 'sets', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'conveying', 'sense', 'upside', 'down', 'sinking', 'ship', 'very', 'well.However', 'aspect', 'movie', 'needed', 'most', 'attention', 'was', 'suspense', 'short', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'real', 'suspense', 'got', 'was', 'wondering', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'idea', 'focusing', 'hard', 'enough', 'When', 'charachter', 'die', 'usually', 'quick', 'manner', 'Oh', 'Let', 'move', 'original', 'charachters', 'are', 'constantly', 'scrambling', 'stay', 'ahead', 'rising', 'water', 'Here', 'hardly', 'water', 'chasing', 'meaning', 'have', 'plenty', 'time', 'keep', 'going', 'only', 'real', 'sinking', 'last', 'minute', 'One', 'quick', 'note', 'rescuers', 'are', 'constantly', 'saying', 'ship', 'going', 'perfectly', 'level', 'climax', 'movie', 'reason', 'satalite', 'images', 'show', 'bow', 'going', 'suspense', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'it.lastly', 'main', 'topic', 'movie', 'family', 'trying', 'stay', 'together', 'just', 'dos', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'mom', 'dad', 'argue', 'then', 'dad', 'eventually', 'have', 'affair', 'woman', 'then', 'coming', 'back', 'family', 'ship', 'over', 'can', 'finally', 'see', 'family', 'what', 'etc', 'really', 'good', 'paper', 'not', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'also', 'morality', 'points', 'brought', 'up', 'such', 'why', 'do', 'terrorists', 'want', 'kill', 'people', 'having', 'affair', 'bad', 'etc', 'very', 'symbolic', 'sequence', 'involving', 'fire', 'end', 'movie', 'where', 'very', 'obvious', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'saints', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'barbecued', 'i', ""'d"", 'say', 'second', 'victim', 'really', 'didd', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'die', 'Take', 'low', 'moral', 'values', 'Overall', 'i', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'sets', 'interest', 'seeing', 'who', 'who', 'compared', 'original', 'movie', 'charachters', 'who', 'died', 'live', 'version', 'good', 'ideas', 'modern', 'day', 'questions', 'trying', 'work', 'classic', 'disaster', 'story', 'most', 'part', 'least', 'pulling', 'halfway', 'off', ""'d"", 'say', 'least', 'rental']",N/A

966597,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B000E1YW22,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[7, 10]","Before ""Poseidon"" hit theaters, this TV-movie remake of Irwin Allen's 1972 disaster film classic aired on NBC this past November. Of course having seen and enjoyed the original ""Poseidon Adventure"", I had to see this one. In the end, I wish I hadn't.This TV-movie version is absolutely bad filmmaking. It's as simple as that. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, and bad special effects. So many of the original film's scenes are replayed here, and the changes that were made were absolutely wrongheaded. For example, the one big change that was made here was how the ship capsizes: instead of a giant tidal wave it's a terrorist blast that sends the ship upside down. To have the ship turn over by a terrorist blast instead of a giant tidal wave was a very big mistake. This was a change that I found totally inappropriate. But that's not all. The movie wastes a fine cast of actors (from Rutger Hauer to Steve Guttenberg to Peter Weller) who are all powerless to stop this film from self-destructing. The writing and directing look as if they were done by amateurs. But the worst thing about it are the lousy special effects, which look absolutely cheap in this film, especially in the fiery climax.I want to make a point at how bad this film is. I don't know if it was the filmmakers behind this junk or the executives at NBC who decided on this but when this movie first aired last November it aired on one night over three hours (with commercials). Originally, this film was supposed to air as a two-parter (four hours over two nights), because that's the version you get on DVD. So this was cut by 40 minutes before making its network debut. I've seen both versions, and either version won't make any difference because they're both bad.The new feature film remake ""Poseidon"" isn't a great film but at least it has better special effects than this one. It also has better actors too, and a director (Wolfgang Petersen) who knows how to make exciting movies (even though his ""Poseidon"" remake isn't as good as his previous movies). So if you have to choose between which remake to watch, see ""Poseidon"" and skip ""The Poseidon Adventure"" TV-movie.But my real advice is all too obvious: stick with the original 1972 movie.",1,Terrible remake of the disaster classic,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,2228,"['Poseidon', 'hit', 'theaters', 'TV-movie', 'remake', 'Irwin', 'Allen', '1972', 'disaster', 'film', 'classic', 'aired', 'NBC', 'past', 'November', 'course', 'having', 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'had', 'see', 'one', 'end', 'wish', ""hadn't.This"", 'TV-movie', 'version', 'absolutely', 'bad', 'filmmaking', 'as', 'simple', 'Bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'writing', 'bad', 'directing', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'So', 'many', 'original', 'film', 'scenes', 'are', 'replayed', 'here', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'were', 'absolutely', 'wrongheaded', 'example', 'one', 'big', 'change', 'was', 'made', 'here', 'was', 'how', 'ship', 'instead', 'giant', 'tidal', 'wave', 'terrorist', 'blast', 'ship', 'upside', 'down', 'have', 'ship', 'turn', 'over', 'terrorist', 'blast', 'instead', 'giant', 'tidal', 'wave', 'was', 'very', 'big', 'mistake', 'was', 'change', 'found', 'totally', 'inappropriate', 'not', 'movie', 'fine', 'cast', 'actors', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'who', 'are', 'powerless', 'stop', 'film', 'self-destructing', 'writing', 'directing', 'look', 'were', 'done', 'amateurs', 'worst', 'thing', 'are', 'lousy', 'special', 'effects', 'look', 'absolutely', 'cheap', 'film', 'especially', 'fiery', 'climax.I', 'want', 'make', 'point', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'filmmakers', 'junk', 'executives', 'NBC', 'who', 'decided', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'aired', 'last', 'November', 'aired', 'one', 'night', 'three', 'hours', 'commercials', 'Originally', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'air', 'two-parter', 'four', 'hours', 'two', 'nights', 'version', 'get', 'DVD', 'So', 'was', 'cut', '40', 'minutes', 'making', 'network', 'debut', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'versions', 'version', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'difference', ""'re"", 'bad.The', 'new', 'feature', 'film', 'remake', 'Poseidon', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'least', 'better', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'also', 'better', 'actors', 'too', 'director', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'who', 'how', 'make', 'exciting', 'movies', 'even', 'Poseidon', 'remake', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'movies', 'So', 'have', 'choose', 'remake', 'watch', 'see', 'Poseidon', 'skip', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'TV-movie.But', 'real', 'advice', 'too', 'obvious', 'stick', 'original', '1972', 'movie']",N/A

Are any remakes necessary?  Probably not, but in an age where original ideas get relegated to the independent filmmakers, Hollywood is trying to cash in on the old chestnuts to revitalize their box office and/or ratings.  With that in mind, this edition of the original is far from great but it's not awful either.  The tsunami doesn't capsize the boat; in this version a terrorist bomb is the nasty.  The movie's cast is likened to the original with many twists in how they are characterized this time around.  Of a large cast of familiar B movie actors, the ones that stand out are Sylvia Sims doing quite well as the Shelley Winters clone, underplaying her role quite nicely; usually villainous Rutger Hauer is a heroic priest who has some nice moments with Sims; Adam Baldwin is a staunch heroic Rogo; and Peter Weller has a nice death scene.  The effects are fair to middling, the CGI creations pretty obvious; there's even a new song, but it can't match the schmaltz of the Oscar winning MORNING AFTER.

966602,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B000E1YW22,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[3, 5]","Here's a great idea - take a much loved classic disaster movie, and make it with a bunch of almost-was and once-was actors, on a TV budget, and draw it out over twice the time!  If that seems like logic to you, then you may well love this entirely redundant time filler.  On the other hand, with some decent stuntwork on display it certainly could have been a lot worse, with the bangs and shouting drowning out the dodgy acting and leaky plot. Yes, there are more holes in the plot than the poor Poseidon has.Based on the original Paul Gallico novel, many of the characters names are the same, and some key set pieces are the same, paying homage to the original (fiery engine room, Christmas tree ladder, and the famous man falling on to glass in the ballroom..).  However, there seems to be a gross misconception of what makes a great disaster movie.  Poseidon Adventure was the start of a wave (sorry) of likeminded movies, which thrived on creating big budget set pieces, but with a background of memorable characters.  Who can forget Gene Hackman's preacher, or Shelley Winter's one-time swimming champion..?  Well the writers here did - they ditched all the memorable aspects those characters had, and added some entirely redundant ones.  Vitally, you soon realise with a sinking feeling that the sense of claustrophobia so brilliantly done in the original is thrown away by a combination of cutting to the outside rescue efforts (terrible idea, in which all suspense is dissipated) and some lightly lit interior sets with a few pools of standing water.  The plot is padded out by having a terrorist plot instead of a giant wave, and while this seems more `with the times' it fails to be more than an obvious plot device, adding nothing except running time.  The sense of being chased by the water lapping at their heels just never appears, even at the end, so the sense of urgency is, shall we say, diluted.The actors frankly seem all at sea, none of them really bringing the required oomph to stem the tide of that nagging `when will it end' feeling.  Steve Guttenberg gamely tries to steal his scenes by grabbing people along the way and trying to talk about his feelings, but he fails to convince - perhaps he is just in too deep?  Rutger Hauer may as well be asleep, or at best on cruise control, for all the charisma he brings to the role.  Only Bryan Brown and Adam Baldwin at least seem to be having some fun, even if there are no new ideas being floated and they fail to stem the tide of boredom for much of the movie.  Stunts are certainly ok, digital effects are so-so.. I watched on a big screen which was less than forgiving, but that's the reality of made for TV perhaps, where not every effect can be ship-shape.And then there is the ending - where in the original, we had the terrific speech from Hackman, adding pathos and gravitas to proceedings, here we have an endless scene of the few survivors crossing a catwalk to escape - which frankly, just doesn't look that dangerous.  It leaves the end feeling somewhat of a damp squib.For family friendly fare, well, this is a Hallmark Channel presentation, so it's probably safe (as long as you don't want to explain to the kids exactly what Steve Guttenberg was doing with that masseuse that made his wife so upset..), and does not embarrass itself too much when seen as a 4 hour TV mini-series compared to others of its type.. but for a fresh stab or even a tribute to a much loved classic - why not just get the original, as this one is just too watered down to be memorable in comparison.",2,Watered down remake,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,3562,"['Here', 'great', 'idea', 'take', 'much', 'loved', 'classic', 'disaster', 'movie', 'make', 'bunch', 'almost-was', 'once-was', 'actors', 'TV', 'budget', 'draw', 'out', 'twice', 'time', 'logic', 'then', 'may', 'well', 'love', 'entirely', 'redundant', 'time', 'filler', 'other', 'hand', 'decent', 'stuntwork', 'display', 'certainly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'worse', 'bangs', 'shouting', 'drowning', 'out', 'dodgy', 'acting', 'leaky', 'plot', 'Yes', 'are', 'more', 'holes', 'plot', 'poor', 'Poseidon', 'has.Based', 'original', 'Paul', 'Gallico', 'novel', 'many', 'characters', 'names', 'are', 'same', 'key', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'same', 'paying', 'homage', 'original', 'fiery', 'engine', 'room', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'ladder', 'famous', 'man', 'falling', 'glass', 'ballroom..', 'However', 'be', 'gross', 'misconception', 'what', 'great', 'disaster', 'movie', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'was', 'start', 'wave', 'sorry', 'likeminded', 'movies', 'thrived', 'creating', 'big', 'budget', 'set', 'pieces', 'background', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'preacher', 'Shelley', 'Winter', 'one-time', 'swimming', 'champion..', 'Well', 'writers', 'here', 'did', 'ditched', 'memorable', 'aspects', 'characters', 'had', 'added', 'entirely', 'redundant', 'ones', 'Vitally', 'soon', 'realise', 'sinking', 'feeling', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'original', 'thrown', 'away', 'combination', 'cutting', 'outside', 'rescue', 'efforts', 'terrible', 'idea', 'suspense', 'dissipated', 'lightly', 'lit', 'interior', 'sets', 'few', 'pools', 'standing', 'water', 'plot', 'padded', 'out', 'having', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'instead', 'giant', 'wave', 'more', 'times', 'be', 'more', 'obvious', 'plot', 'device', 'adding', 'nothing', 'running', 'time', 'sense', 'being', 'chased', 'water', 'lapping', 'heels', 'just', 'never', 'even', 'end', 'sense', 'urgency', 'shall', 'say', 'diluted.The', 'actors', 'frankly', 'seem', 'sea', 'none', 'really', 'bringing', 'required', 'oomph', 'stem', 'tide', 'nagging', 'when', 'will', 'end', 'feeling', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'gamely', 'steal', 'scenes', 'grabbing', 'people', 'way', 'trying', 'talk', 'feelings', 'convince', 'perhaps', 'just', 'too', 'deep', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'asleep', 'best', 'cruise', 'control', 'charisma', 'role', 'Only', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'least', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'even', 'are', 'new', 'ideas', 'being', 'floated', 'fail', 'stem', 'tide', 'boredom', 'much', 'movie', 'Stunts', 'are', 'certainly', 'ok', 'digital', 'effects', 'are', 'so-so..', 'watched', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'less', 'forgiving', 'reality', 'made', 'TV', 'perhaps', 'where', 'not', 'effect', 'can', 'be', 'ship-shape.And', 'then', 'ending', 'where', 'original', 'had', 'terrific', 'speech', 'Hackman', 'adding', 'pathos', 'gravitas', 'proceedings', 'here', 'have', 'endless', 'scene', 'few', 'survivors', 'crossing', 'catwalk', 'escape', 'frankly', 'just', ""n't"", 'look', 'dangerous', 'end', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'damp', 'squib.For', 'family', 'friendly', 'fare', 'well', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'presentation', 'probably', 'safe', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'explain', 'kids', 'exactly', 'what', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'was', 'doing', 'masseuse', 'made', 'wife', 'so', 'upset..', 'not', 'embarrass', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'seen', '4', 'hour', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'compared', 'others', 'type..', 'fresh', 'stab', 'even', 'tribute', 'much', 'loved', 'classic', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'get', 'original', 'one', 'just', 'too', 'watered', 'down', 'be', 'memorable', 'comparison']",N/A

Cutting to outside the stricken ship to monitor the rescue efforts is a very serious mistake: one that compromises the claustrophobia and disorientation of the original. But there are characters, and subplots, and conflicts--which Wolfgang Petersen's version disregards entirely. This version modernizes the story, with the capsizing being the result of a terrorist bombing. Unexpected, and clever. But although there are some nice tributes to the original (climbing the Christmas tree, man through the skylight) this had been done perfectly already in 1972, and didn't need to be revisited. C. Thomas Howell, who plays the doctor, is the son of one of the actors who played an officer on the bridge in the original film. It's a nice connection.

Had to pay a lot of attention to what the characters were saying and a lot of them talk in thick accents. But otherwise, the movie was brilliant! Sadly, this movie seemed to bomb out on the reviews--a lot of low-stars here on Amazon. Let me straighten one of the reasons out.""The Navy SEAL is yelling that the ship is sinking, but the ship shows no sign of sinking at all."" DUHHHHH! It's a 150,000-ton cruise ship! Even while capsized and 90 percent underwater, the mass of the ship is huge and is at least 150 feet high out of the water from the capsized keel to the waterline, so it wouldn't show the entire ship making the plunge just yet. And the Navy SEAL lieutenant was right. Anyone would know that by that time, the ship wouldn't have much time left and it showed in several shots that the bow was just a little lower in the water than before. His estimate that it would have less than 30 minutes left was right on the dot. Large ships simply wouldn't sink as fast as the movie viewers would expect them to. The Titanic itself was cut open 300 feet by an iceberg in 1912 and it stayed afloat more than 2 hours, never making such a dramatic dive into the ocean until the very end. So the way they had the ship in it's last moments was accurate enough for the budget in making this movie. I especially liked the way the ship was turning over after the bomb went off! It seems to stay level enough for a few minutes while the terrorist was taking over the ship, but the level of water entering the punctured waterline eventually loses the ship's stability to stay level and WHUMP!Some other viewers attacked the way the ship had capsized. ""Ooh, we're used to the ship being turned over by a freak wave, not a terrorist attack."" What the heck is that supposed to mean? In these days, it's more obvious that terrorists from the Middle East might make a sneak attack on something else than hijacked planes and kill thousands of people just to bring their point across. Cruise ships hold thousands of people and an attack on one of those would be definite in the near-future if we're not careful. Plus, the odds that a ship would capsize from an exploding bomb is more greater than being capsized by a 500-foot freak wave. You think other ships might have noticed such a thing forming from far off and send out a warning in time? Right.This movie was great, focusing on several people that end up being on the ship. The father, played by Steve Guttenburg, suffering from a troublesome marriage, and going on the cruise to be with his family. His 12-year old son with his video camera makes things surprising as well. Imagine having footage of people trying to get out of a capsized, sinking luxury ship! Then we have the producer from Australia and his wife, the reverend, the old widow, and the somewhat-paranoid agent from Homeland Security, who tracks the comings and goings on the ship, and hoping to keep a low profile aboard while racking up suspects for a terrorist attack. That cruise director guy was an annoying freak, though. He takes command of the people in the ballroom and tries to keep them from leaving, even when the water has risen 6 inches in the first hour after the capsizing. Any moron can see those windows in there won't hold back the water pressure for too long, and even when the windows collapse, you see the same moron trying to keep people from climbing up the Christmas tree to the only exit, right before it topples over and the room turns into a death crypt.I also liked the response of rescue units to the area in those scenes where they realize the ship has gone missing.

It is an insult to the memory of Irwin Allen (the producer of the 1972 film) and Paul Gallico (the author of the 1969 novel).Since this was made for TV (by Hallmark no less), I guess I shouldn't have expected anything great.  But this is BAD.  The writing is horrific and the performances are some of the worst ever.I do believe ""The Poseidon Adventure"" would benefit from an updated version. And with Wolfgang Petersen - the master of the sea epic - at the helm, the big screen version due out in May of 2006 (titled ""Poseidon"") is the remake I am looking forward to.But this 2005 version starring D-list has beens should not be viewed.
