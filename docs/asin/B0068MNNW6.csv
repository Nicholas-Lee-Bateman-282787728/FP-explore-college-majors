Name recognition? I personally have never heard of the other two main characters or even the second supporting young female character. Anyway, this movie is a man's movie I think. I think you can see that men have been boxed and packaged as this movie shows two metrosexuals and not two real men. I doubt real men exist in America any more except in some guy's inner voice. It is sad that men have been castrated and repressed but . . . they kinda allowed it to happen I guess. Anyway the movie is pretty honest. It isn't like they are crying with their wives over the birth of a baby or shown spooning someone. They have problems. Guy problems. They are detached. They appear to be heartless but of course are not . . . guys just show emotion differently. And the movie attempts to show them/deal with them (problems) as guys would instead of how women think guys would. So all in all pretty accurate. It is realistic in the way it shows metrosexuals from LA . . . how they behave too. I don't mean straight guys who want to be or really are gay. I mean men . . . straight men . . . who dress up to go play golf or care about their hair and socks etc. That is metrosexual to me. Just shallowness and immaturity too. Doesn't apologize for it or try to lift it up as something to aspire to by poking fun at it. It just shows it. It is really a great commentary on how Americas are now after the baby boomer destruction. People dying alone. People being found dead by accident as they were single and alone to begin with. People knowing no one to put down as their emergency contact. And while I can't stand most of these foul movies I would say the one guy cursing . . . that was more art than just art trying to corrupt/influence. That is how a guy like that would speak I think. The ending was incomplete and not really satisfying internally. But I have a feeling for these two people that is appropriate.

His best friend Jon is single and trying to help him out decides to go on a long weekend to Palm Springs.  In between golf rounds the two 50 year olds meet a young 25 year old woman who introduces them to her roommate...her 50 year old mother. The two men then begin to realize what's important and what they need in thier lives. Lately I have been watching movies before I see the previews for them. It helps me to not have any preconcieved notions going in and I watch it with a more open mind. I watched the preview for this one, and I realize why I don't usually do it anymore. The preview is very funny and I was looking forward to it. I was very let down. The best way to describe this is if the guys from ""Swingers"" grew up but didn't really change (except they lost thier humor) and turned into pathetic versions of themselves. It could be because I'm only 33 and this is meant for an older crowd but I didn't really like this movie at all. Overall, not for me, but 50 year olds and up may.  I just didn't get it.  I give it a C-",2,"An un-funny remake of ""Swingers"" dealing with 50 year olds and the search for love and more. I didn't enjoy this.
