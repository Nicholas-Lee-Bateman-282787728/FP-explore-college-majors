David Hasselhoff is so handsome as Mitch and he is a good role model for all the lifeguards who work with him.. Just recently watched this movie on Youtube and thought it would make a nice DVD to add to my collection..

I really enjoyed it ! Several of the past characters (which are listed by another reviewer,so I won't repeat them) come together for Mitch's ""Hawaiian Wedding"". It was fun to see what the characters were up to now-Caroline is an actress,C.J. owns a cool club in Hawaii,Eddie and Cort are now filming wildlife,etc. During the course of the movie,some interesting romances develop between various characters ,which I thought was a fun twist. The movie was kind of a mini Baywatch reunion. It is really too bad more of the actors' on the show didn't participate. It would have been really cool to see more. Even so,this was a fun movie. Drama,action,attractive people and beaches (all the things that attracted me to Baywatch).I must say the cast looked great and it was fun to see some of my old favorites from the show. The scenery in Hawaii was wonderful,as well. If you like Baywatch,this movie is worth checking out!",5,I really enjoyed this movie !!!,1282176000,"08 19, 2010",2010,1035,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Baywatch', 't.v', 'series', 'when', 'came', 'movie', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Several', 'past', 'characters', 'are', 'listed', 'reviewer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'come', 'together', 'Mitch', 'Hawaiian', 'Wedding', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'up', 'now-Caroline', 'actress', 'C.J', 'cool', 'club', 'Hawaii', 'Eddie', 'Cort', 'are', 'now', 'filming', 'wildlife', 'etc', 'course', 'movie', 'interesting', 'romances', 'develop', 'various', 'characters', 'thought', 'was', 'fun', 'twist', 'movie', 'was', 'kind', 'mini', 'Baywatch', 'reunion', 'really', 'too', 'bad', 'more', 'actors', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'participate', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'cool', 'see', 'more', 'Even', 'so', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'Drama', 'action', 'attractive', 'people', 'beaches', 'things', 'attracted', 'Baywatch', '.I', 'must', 'say', 'cast', 'looked', 'great', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'old', 'favorites', 'show', 'scenery', 'Hawaii', 'was', 'wonderful', 'as', 'well', 'like', 'Baywatch', 'movie', 'checking', 'out']",N/A
