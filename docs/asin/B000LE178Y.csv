And this season contains some fascinating cases: a bus of kids abudcted, a satire-laden fake kidnapping, a murderous twin (but who knows which one?), and many more.  We're also treated to some great character moments.  Martin loses control and ends up shooting a suspect; Vivian makes an irreversible choice to lie to protect both their careers, and both have to deal with the consequences in later episodes.  Samantha is forced into counseling after being shot in the Season One finale; she says she's fine, but we know she isn't.  Danny has to choose whether to testify on his brother's behalf, or abandon him the way he once abandoned Danny.  An Alzheimer's diagnosis forces Jack to re-evaluate the strained relationship with his father (wonderfully played by Martin Landau), and a certain case causes him to relive his painful adolescence with an emotionally unstable mother.Overall, this season continues the watchability and excellent writing begun by Season One.For the curious, here is the episode list, first aired 09/25/03-05/20/04.The BusRevelationsConfidenceProdigyCopycatOur Sons And DaughtersA Tree FallsTrip BoxMoving OnComing HomeExposureHawks And HandsawsLife RulesThe LineWannabeRisenGung HoLegacyDoppelgangerShadowsTwo FamiliesThe SeasonLost And FoundBait",5,I was starting to wonder ...,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,1344,"['would', 'ever', 'get', 'Trace', 'season', 'region', '1', 'season', 'fascinating', 'cases', 'bus', 'kids', 'abudcted', 'satire-laden', 'fake', 'kidnapping', 'murderous', 'twin', 'who', 'one', 'many', 'more', ""'re"", 'also', 'treated', 'great', 'character', 'moments', 'Martin', 'control', 'up', 'shooting', 'suspect', 'Vivian', 'irreversible', 'choice', 'lie', 'protect', 'careers', 'have', 'deal', 'consequences', 'later', 'episodes', 'Samantha', 'forced', 'counseling', 'being', 'shot', 'Season', 'One', 'finale', 'fine', 'know', ""n't"", 'Danny', 'choose', 'testify', 'brother', 'behalf', 'abandon', 'way', 'once', 'abandoned', 'Danny', 'Alzheimer', 'diagnosis', 'forces', 'Jack', 're-evaluate', 'strained', 'relationship', 'father', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'certain', 'case', 'relive', 'painful', 'adolescence', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'mother.Overall', 'season', 'watchability', 'excellent', 'writing', 'begun', 'Season', 'One.For', 'curious', 'here', 'episode', 'list', 'first', 'aired', '09/25/03-05/20/04.The', 'BusRevelationsConfidenceProdigyCopycatOur', 'Sons', 'DaughtersA', 'Tree', 'FallsTrip', 'BoxMoving', 'OnComing', 'HomeExposureHawks', 'HandsawsLife', 'RulesThe', 'LineWannabeRisenGung', 'HoLegacyDoppelgangerShadowsTwo', 'FamiliesThe', 'SeasonLost', 'FoundBait']",Without a Trace: Season 2

The premise is simple - at the beginning of each episode someone goes missing, and the FBI's (fictional) Missing Persons Unit searches for them, following the trail the various clues lead to.  While the mystery is (generally) solved by episode's end, the show offers no guarantee of a happy ending.The show has had some very compelling sometimes gut-wrenching storylines, and very strong acting (the American FBI unit is played by a combo Australian/British/American cast).  The head of the unit is Jack Malone, a great character who often uses physcology and rough around-the-edges tactics in his questioning to arrive at the truth.  Jack is also ""on the edge,"" will not play politics with his superiors, and of course his personal life is often a mess.Some eposides also offer a particularily ""dark"" tone, but still very intelligent storytelling.  Standout episodes from season 2 include ""The Bus"" (episode 1), ""Copycat"" (episode 5) ""Wannabe,"" (15) ""Doppleganger,""(19) and ""Two Families"" (episode 21).  Though each episode usually features a ""stand-alone"" plot, the show occasionally rewards regular viewers with a degree of continuity - occasionally  a compelling storyline or ""villian"" re-appears in later episodes.I agree with others that it's a shame that only through season 2 has been released on DVD - guess I just gotta keep setting the VCR for TNT.",5,One of the best shows on TV!,1231286400,"01 7, 2009",2009,1559,"['do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'heck', 'lot', 'primetime', 'tv', 'consider', 'most', 'so', 'un-original', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'currently', 'airing', 'Office', 'new', 'Battlestar', 'opinion', 'premise', 'simple', 'beginning', 'episode', 'someone', 'missing', 'FBI', 'fictional', 'Missing', 'Persons', 'Unit', 'searches', 'following', 'trail', 'various', 'clues', 'lead', 'mystery', 'generally', 'solved', 'episode', 'end', 'show', 'guarantee', 'happy', 'ending.The', 'show', 'had', 'very', 'compelling', 'sometimes', 'gut-wrenching', 'storylines', 'very', 'strong', 'acting', 'American', 'FBI', 'unit', 'played', 'combo', 'Australian/British/American', 'cast', 'head', 'unit', 'Jack', 'Malone', 'great', 'character', 'who', 'often', 'physcology', 'rough', 'around-the-edges', 'tactics', 'questioning', 'arrive', 'truth', 'Jack', 'also', 'edge', 'will', 'not', 'play', 'politics', 'superiors', 'course', 'personal', 'life', 'often', 'mess.Some', 'eposides', 'also', 'offer', 'particularily', 'dark', 'tone', 'still', 'very', 'intelligent', 'storytelling', 'Standout', 'season', '2', 'include', 'Bus', 'episode', '1', 'Copycat', 'episode', '5', 'Wannabe', '15', 'Doppleganger', '19', 'Two', 'Families', 'episode', '21', 'episode', 'usually', 'stand-alone', 'plot', 'show', 'occasionally', 'regular', 'viewers', 'degree', 'continuity', 'occasionally', 'compelling', 'storyline', 'villian', 're-appears', 'later', 'episodes.I', 'agree', 'others', 'shame', 'only', 'season', '2', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'guess', 'just', 'got', 'ta', 'keep', 'setting', 'VCR', 'TNT']",Without a Trace: Season 2
