9930,A1166FE81ADOUR,0767809688,50s sci-fi Fan,"[7, 7]","This Collector's Edition is worth getting for the extras alone. They have a useful discussion about the increasing challenge of TV to Classical Hollywood in the early 50s a reference to Elia Kazan,""On the Waterfront""  (1954) a  HUAC ""friendly witness"" and Edward Dmytryk, the only one of the Hollywood Ten to turn around and name names. ~ Australians here may remember the (destroyer) Voyager Incident of 1964 ~ was she cut in half by the carrier Melbourne. Inquest witnesses frequently referred to quote: ""a Caine Mutiny situation"" aboard Voyager.Anyway, The Caine Mutiny was made at the tail end of the ""movie star era"", so there's a danger of being dazzled by the ""Boggie aura"" and not being objective about the actions of the troubled Capt.Queeg, or even noticing the good job Bogart does in the role.Fred McMurray too, has a powerful screen presence and he plays the devious Lt. Tom Keefer with a darkness not seen since his Walter Neff in ""Double Indenity;"" a complete contrast to his fatherly, ""My Three Sons"" personae. Yet McMurray's ""star appeal"" can also obscure his ""thinking preformance"" - he clearly lets you read every ""shifty"" thought on Keefer's face. Keefer only verbalises his true colors (no pun) when he ""'fesses up"" to a ""yellow streak 10 miles wide,"" after Maryk corners him into seeing Admiral Halsey about Queeg.There is an interesting association with cowardice and the color yellow here; we have Queeg, throwing the yellow dye marker in panic and running from duty and Keefer's calculating, ""too smart to be brave"" yellow as he runs from responsibility - who then, is the true coward and why?Van Johnson is on ""safe"" ground; Lt. Steve Maryk, is an extension of his own affable, fair minded self, a qualilty that prevents him from understanding that Keefer's duplicity and deflected hatred of the Navy will make him legally culpable of mutiny.Jos&eacute; Ferrer is a commanding screen presence at any time, and he makes Lt. Barney Greenwald seem to have been there for the entire picture. Ferrer plays his final scene with intimidating indignation - he has been drinking he says, to assuage ""his guilty conscience"" and we learn for the first time of his dilemma in defending Maryk.Still you can put meditations on the complexities of human nature aside if you want and take ""The Caine Mutiny"" as pure wartime action, but you'd miss the little payoffs. It took me a long time, for example, to notice one small give-away detail; the dismissal of Comdr. DeVriess (Tom Tully) as a ""slack"" commanding officer by the rather affectless Robert Francis as Ens. Willis Seward Keith. The J.G.'s assessment seemed valid enough - until I noticed DeVriess timing Maryk's, perfomance on the paravanes with a stop-watch!DeVriess had the maturity and experience to know how and when to get the best out of his command, but he will not push his ""tired crew"" and ""beaten up tub that ought to be melted down for razor blades,"" beyond their frayed limits. A ""slack"" commander, Willie? Sometimes you just have to trust the captain to steer the right course, even if you don't!The moral complexity of the mutiny on the Caine is further complicated by Queeg's honesty and humility in seeking ""constructive loyalty"" from his officers after the ""yellow stain"" incident. His officers' rejection of his plea raises questions about subordination to lawful authority.Greenwald carefully avoids these explosive issues in the court-martial, but not so with Keefer at the ""joyful celebration."" He elicits support from Maryk, ""You're an honest man, Steve. Tell me, do you think it would have necessary for you to have taken command if you'd given Queeg the loyalty and support he deserved?"" ~ (powerful stuff.)The Caine Mutiny is great war film: good to see it out on DVD. Also the commentary track and the extra features have a lot on interesting information on the problems in Hollywood with falling ticket sales and the reasons why war films were popular at the time.THe two extras on the blacklist and especially about Edward Dmytryk, the only one of the Hollywood 10 who eventually  ""named names,"" were interesting as well as references to Elia Kazan and his use of Terry Malloy in ""On the Waterfront"" to justify his own testemony before HUAC.",5,Important ethical questions with a solid cast.,1178236800,"05 4, 2007",2007,4239,"['Collector', 'Edition', 'getting', 'extras', 'alone', 'have', 'useful', 'discussion', 'increasing', 'challenge', 'TV', 'Classical', 'Hollywood', 'early', '50s', 'reference', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Waterfront', '1954', 'HUAC', 'friendly', 'witness', 'Edward', 'Dmytryk', 'only', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'Ten', 'turn', 'around', 'name', 'names', '~', 'Australians', 'here', 'may', 'remember', 'destroyer', 'Voyager', 'Incident', '1964', '~', 'was', 'cut', 'half', 'carrier', 'Melbourne', 'Inquest', 'frequently', 'referred', 'quote', 'Caine', 'Mutiny', 'situation', 'aboard', 'Voyager.Anyway', 'Caine', 'Mutiny', 'was', 'made', 'tail', 'end', 'movie', 'star', 'era', 'danger', 'being', 'dazzled', 'Boggie', 'aura', 'not', 'being', 'objective', 'actions', 'troubled', 'Capt.Queeg', 'even', 'noticing', 'good', 'job', 'Bogart', 'role.Fred', 'McMurray', 'too', 'powerful', 'screen', 'presence', 'devious', 'Lt.', 'Tom', 'Keefer', 'darkness', 'not', 'seen', 'Walter', 'Neff', 'Double', 'Indenity', 'complete', 'contrast', 'fatherly', 'Three', 'Sons', 'personae', 'McMurray', 'star', 'appeal', 'can', 'also', 'obscure', 'thinking', 'preformance', 'clearly', 'read', 'shifty', 'thought', 'Keefer', 'face', 'Keefer', 'only', 'true', 'colors', 'pun', 'when', 'up', 'yellow', 'streak', '10', 'miles', 'wide', 'Maryk', 'seeing', 'Admiral', 'Halsey', 'Queeg.There', 'interesting', 'association', 'cowardice', 'color', 'yellow', 'here', 'have', 'Queeg', 'throwing', 'yellow', 'dye', 'marker', 'panic', 'running', 'duty', 'Keefer', 'calculating', 'too', 'smart', 'be', 'brave', 'responsibility', 'who', 'then', 'true', 'coward', 'why', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'safe', 'ground', 'Lt.', 'Steve', 'Maryk', 'extension', 'own', 'affable', 'fair', 'minded', 'self', 'qualilty', 'understanding', 'Keefer', 'duplicity', 'deflected', 'hatred', 'Navy', 'will', 'make', 'legally', 'culpable', 'mutiny.Jos', 'eacute', 'Ferrer', 'commanding', 'screen', 'presence', 'time', 'Lt.', 'Barney', 'Greenwald', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'entire', 'picture', 'Ferrer', 'final', 'scene', 'intimidating', 'indignation', 'been', 'drinking', 'assuage', 'guilty', 'conscience', 'learn', 'first', 'time', 'dilemma', 'defending', 'Maryk.Still', 'can', 'put', 'meditations', 'complexities', 'human', 'nature', 'aside', 'want', 'take', 'Caine', 'Mutiny', 'pure', 'wartime', 'action', ""'d"", 'miss', 'little', 'payoffs', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'example', 'notice', 'one', 'small', 'give-away', 'detail', 'dismissal', 'Comdr', 'DeVriess', 'Tom', 'Tully', 'slack', 'commanding', 'officer', 'rather', 'affectless', 'Robert', 'Francis', 'Ens', 'Willis', 'Seward', 'Keith', 'J.G', 'assessment', 'seemed', 'valid', 'enough', 'noticed', 'DeVriess', 'timing', 'Maryk', 'perfomance', 'paravanes', 'stop-watch', 'DeVriess', 'had', 'maturity', 'experience', 'know', 'how', 'when', 'get', 'best', 'command', 'will', 'not', 'push', 'tired', 'crew', 'beaten', 'up', 'tub', 'ought', 'be', 'melted', 'down', 'razor', 'blades', 'frayed', 'limits', 'slack', 'commander', 'Willie', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'have', 'trust', 'captain', 'steer', 'right', 'course', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'moral', 'complexity', 'mutiny', 'Caine', 'further', 'complicated', 'Queeg', 'honesty', 'humility', 'seeking', 'constructive', 'loyalty', 'officers', 'yellow', 'stain', 'incident', 'officers', 'rejection', 'plea', 'questions', 'subordination', 'lawful', 'authority.Greenwald', 'carefully', 'explosive', 'issues', 'court-martial', 'not', 'so', 'Keefer', 'joyful', 'celebration', 'support', 'Maryk', ""'re"", 'honest', 'man', 'Steve', 'Tell', 'do', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'necessary', 'have', 'taken', 'command', ""'d"", 'given', 'Queeg', 'loyalty', 'support', 'deserved', '~', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'Caine', 'Mutiny', 'great', 'war', 'film', 'good', 'see', 'out', 'DVD', 'Also', 'commentary', 'track', 'extra', 'features', 'have', 'lot', 'interesting', 'information', 'problems', 'Hollywood', 'falling', 'ticket', 'sales', 'reasons', 'why', 'war', 'films', 'were', 'popular', 'time.THe', 'two', 'extras', 'blacklist', 'especially', 'about', 'Edward', 'Dmytryk', 'only', 'one', 'Hollywood', '10', 'who', 'eventually', 'named', 'names', 'were', 'interesting', 'as', 'well', 'references', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'use', 'Terry', 'Malloy', 'Waterfront', 'justify', 'own', 'testemony', 'HUAC']",N/A
9931,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0767809688,Acute Observer,"[0, 3]","The film was produced by Stanley Kramer and adopted from a Herman Wouk novel. The film begins with a graduating class of ensigns. They will commence their education at sea. Ensign Keith's mom asks him to be careful and to not volunteer. The 'Caine' seems to be run-down, it is a minesweeper that has seen a lot of action. The two new ensigns see the entire ship. The ship and the men are tired, it is a slack ship. Then the ship gets a new captain, Lt. Cmdr. Queeg. The new captain runs everything by the book. Sailors will have a proper haircut, be clean shaven, and keep their shirts in their pants. Queeg's involvement in a petty detail results in the loss of a towing target. [He didn't properly delegate a task.]The 'Caine' will take part in an invasion. But the ship turns around before it reaches the limit. Queeg holds a meeting, he is upset. Tom Kiefer criticizes the captain's mental state. His actions seem contradictory. Then there is the missing strawberries. Queeg surmises there was a duplicate key used to steal the strawberries, and orders a search of everyone on ship. Tom Kiefer displays his character on the Admiral's flattop. The fleet will be attacked by a typhoon. The crew is ordered to wear lifejackets. Queeg seems stunned by the storm, Maryk takes charge and relieves the Captain under Article 184. The rest of the officers go along. The 'Caine' survives to return to port and an inquiry into this action. [Isn't the correct procedure to sail into the waves?]Their lawyer meets with them to defend Maryk and Keith. The crew testifies to what they observed. It looks bad for Maryk and Keith. Then Captain Queeg testifies about his actions. All of his problems were caused by his disloyal officers; Queeg was perfect. Lawyer Greenwald appeals to the Naval officers sitting in judgment. Merrick was acquitted but his career is over. At the celebration Greenwald gives a speech that summarizes the events. He blames the officers for not supporting Queeg after the towing incident, and blames Kiefer for creating distrust of Queeg! [This seems apposite of what we saw.] At the end Keith returns to his ship and finds the original Captain has returned.[The lawyer's speech about those who joined the military before the war overlooks the historical facts and the economic conditions.] This film was made with the cooperation of the US Navy. You can contrast it to ""Mr. Roberts"" for another view of the situation. The film ""Paths of Glory"" also is about commanding an operation. [This film may be a symbol for Korea.

Fultz,"[0, 0]","For many of my generation, Fred MacMurray is the father on &quot;My Three Sons&quot; repeats and the best military/courtroom drama is &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;.  Many people my age have not even heard of, much less seen,  the Caine Mutiny.  Well, I am here to tell all of you Gen X'ers (anyone  else sick of that term?), don't miss this movie.  It is a compelling story  of a &quot;mutiny&quot; aboard a naval ship during World War II.The  story centers around the ship the Caine.  The easy-going Captain of the  Caine is replaced by the disciplinarian Captain Queeg (marvelously  portrayed by Humphrey Bogart).  The crew is not used to the Queeg's ways  and question his leadership.  Led by Lt. Keefer (MacMurray in a role vastly  different from his Disney and &quot;Sons&quot; days), several officers on  the Caine begin laying the groundwork for removing Queeg from power. When  the moment comes, the drama has been built to a peak.The trial that  follows the mutiny is a well written, and the performances are wonderfull.  If you enjoyed the courtroom scenes of &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, you will  not want to miss this movie.  The ending of the film, revealing the true  problem aboard the Caine, is great drama.  Jose Ferrar's performance in the  final scene is one of the best around.  The cast is for the most part  fantastic.  Bogart is of course on of the finest actors of all time and  gives one of his best, deepest performances in this film.  In addition to  MacMurray and Ferrar, Van Johnson, E.G. Marshall, and Scott Savage also are  excellent.  Robert Francis is the only weak link in the cast, but even his  performance can't spoil this great film.  Look for Lee Marvin in an a small  role.So, younger viewers, if you have not seen &quot;The Caine  Mutiny&quot; yet, get ahold of this classic.

9937,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,0767809688,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 1]","THE CAINE MUTINY is a very successful and lucrative 1954 movie adaptation of Herman Wouk's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1952 novel of the same name.  I watched and am reviewing the DVD version of the movie, not the ""Combat Classics"" DVD release of the same film of which, although it costs from fifty cents to a buck and a half more (Amazon listings are at variance here) I could find no distinctions in the product information (whatever any difference, it is likely that reviews of both versions are being lumped together here).Like the novel, the film follows the experiences and misadventures of a rookie Ensign, Willie Keith (Robert Francis), as he sees his first active duty on an obscure Navy minesweeper, the Caine, during World War II.  Willie's first captain on the Caine is a grizzled old salt (played by Tom Tunney) who is long on morale and group cohesiveness but short on spit-and-polish: he lets the men grow beards and take a lackadaisical approach to maintenance on the CAINE, which everyone knew was an ""old rust-bucket"" from World War One that should have been decomissioned by the time it was reactivated and pressed into duty in the Pacific Theater during World War Two.  Willie -- whose only experience has been textbook -- longs for a more by-the-book commander until the ship gets a new captain, Philip Queeg, who is long on spit-and-polish, rules and regs, but (it becomes increasingly apparent) short on pragmatic decision-making and possibly command bravery.** SPOILER GRAFS **  Captain Queeg's limitations become increasingly apparent.  In an early episode, he is so busy obsessing over a sailor's untucked shirt during a naval exercise that he causes the minesweeper to destroy a valuable piece of Navy property -- and, in a move typical of his personality, shifts the blame to a subordinate.  A sardonic Ivy League grad who resents being taken away from a writing career (Keefer, played by Fred MacMurray) suggests to his fellow officer Maryk (Van Johnson) that Captain Queeg is is mentally ill, suffering from a ""paranoid personality"".  Strictly by the book, Keefer is correct: Wikipedia defines a paranoid personality [not to be confused with paranoid schizophrenia] in terms that suit Philip Queeg precisely:  ""a pervasive, long-standing suspiciousness and generalized mistrust of others"" whose sufferers ""may be hypersensitive, easily feel slighted, and habitually relate to the world by vigilant scanning of the environment for clues or suggestions that may validate their fears or biases . . . They think they are in danger and look for signs and threats of that danger, potentially not appreciating other evidence.""  Maryk, who was a mediocre student in college, is initially unsure of Keefer's suggestion but starts a private diary that documents Queeg's numerous rigidities and obsessions.  Queeg's ongoing command decisions are poor enough that the suggestion he suffers from a serious personality flaw seems reasonable.  Certainly he brought shipboard morale to an all-time low.Push comes to shove when the CAINE is caught in the (real-life) Typhoon Cobra.  The barometer hits bottom and the ship lists dangerously in the waves.  Despite frequent prompting by Keith, Maryk and Keefer, Captain Queeg does nothing--a decision, or is he unable to think and exert authority?  Citing Navy regulations, Queeg's subordinates relieve him of duty--a mutiny, or close to it.  Back in San Francisco, Maryk and Keith face court-martial.  Much of the testimony reduces to ""he said, he said"" regarding what really happened on board the CAINE during the Typhoon.  At least, until Captain Queeg takes the stand under the strain of justifying himself, and impeaches his testimony and his career over a quart of shipboard strawberries and two ball bearings he nervously fondles. ** END SPOILERS **By modern standards, it is possible to find fault with the production values of this movie.  Naval action in and around the CAINE is related by a mixture of file footage, long-shot photography, indoor-set shooting and (especially during the storm) a miniature ship in a water tank.  However, such was the state of the art in 1954 that even an A-list, ""A"" movie like this one had to endure such compromises.  What really distinguishes THE CAINE MUTINY is the caliber of its cast and the outstanding performances they turn in.  Even the minor players, swabbies such as Lee Marvin as ""Meatball"" and Claude Aikins as ""Horrible,"" offer spot-on comic relief.  (And Marvin, who had seen actual sea duty, served as unofficial technical advisor--if a shot didn't feel right to him, he would speak up, and usually his opinion prevailed.)  Van Johnson portrays very well the ethical and situational stress he is put under as one of Capt. Queeg's underlings.  (In a bow to verisimillitude, Johnson left undisguised some serious forehead scars he had sustained while filming a prior movie.)  Fred MacMurray's character Keefer, underneath his sardonic, know-it-all mask, is revealed to be a coward and an opportunistic stinker who rivals if not excels his better-known bad guy role as the complacent insurance executive in THE APARTMENT (1960).  It fell to relative newcomer Robert Francis to portray the thankless role of the central character, wishy-washy Ensign Willie Keith.  The film has no better explanation for Willie's feckless behavior than inexperience and ""Mom-ism""; much better told in Wouk's 500-plus-page novel is the fact that Willie is a bit of a stinker himself, who ditches his girlfriend by ignoring her letters and is quite content, after having missed the Caine's departure, to luxuriate for months in Honolulu's social life as the pampered protegee of and assisant to a powerful land-based Admiral.  Sadly, we lack career-length evidence of Francis' acting merit; he died the following year in a private-plane crash.But of course the major reason for this film's triumph was the decision to cast Humphrey Bogart against type as the vacillating and detail-obsessed lifer, Philip Queeg, a role Bogart wanted so badly he took a reduced salary to get it.  From the git-go Bogart's characterization impresses, not only emotionally but physically (how did he hide his neck?) and the theme of the ""little man,"" not up to the demands of captaincy but ready to fret over small regulations and any slight real or imagined, and carries through to the devastating climax at the hands of defense attorney Barney Greenwald (a very steely Jose Ferrer).  While at times the plot seems a little perfunctory (how else could a 570-page novel turn into a standard American release of just over two hours?), THE CAINE COURT-MARIAL is at all times absorbing and impactful.  The story of how this film (eventually) came to be made is interesting, but I refer the curious to imdb lest this review become even longer.  Image-wise, border crispness and Technicolor were fine, but the 1:85 (standard Panavision) aspect ratio strangely did not fully adapt to the HDTV screen but instead left a bottom margin.  Nonethless, highly recommended.Comparison imdb ratings:MR.

In a break with tradition, the movie adaptation opened in June '54 while the play was still running.""Caine"" was intended to be a 3.5 hour film, but COLUMBIA studio head Harry Cohn had the script shortened to two hours.

9943,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0767809688,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 7/12Rate: 97/12: I had read Marlon Brando's autobiography, and in it, he criticized Humphrey Bogart for his one dimensional acting. Knowing that Marlon was always full of it, I point out the career that Bogart has had. The difference between a very good actor and a one timer is the consistency to perform admirably well in films that are now regarded as classics. Marlon Brando has never be one of them, but Humphrey Bogart is in that class. He also had done it so to the end of his life, and The Caine Mutiny is a proof of his enduring greatness. Bogart stole the show in every scene he appeared in. In contrary to what people think, he was not the villain of the film. He was just a worn out person who had trouble quitting while he was ahead. However, the real villain of The Caine Mutiny was Fred MacMurray's character. I admit, I've never liked anything he had done; he was full of it just like Marlon Brando was. But his personality served the character to the point. Finally, the performance that was as good as Bogart was Jos&eacute;  Ferrer's. He was brilliant as the lawyer, and his alone, along with the other lawyer character, helped to transform The Caine Mutiny as an intellectual picture after the fait accompli of the mutiny. His words, while he was drunk, at the end put the movie and each of the characters in a perspective and pushed it decidedly to being labeled as a masterpiece. I am going to stop short of giving the film a full `10' rating because I think it was uneven throughout. The performances by everyone minus Bogart, Ferrer, and Van Johnson (who was very good by the way) were off, and the stock footage of the Navy scenes was pretty lame to look at. The romance interlude between Keith and May was unnecessary and added absolutely nothing to the film.

Even his dramatic testimony in the court martial shows his carefully tapered climb to prove the defense's case.Fred MacMurray delivers a stellar performance as the slimy officer who stirs the pot. Putting ideas into the heads of those not as smart as he is and getting their thoughts to turn to his way of thinking.  Watching him continually push the XO about the captain's ability to command and then listening to his testimony during the court martial, classic. Even outside after he testifies when Keith calls him the word master.  LT Keefer states, &#34;yes, I knew what's was doing.&#34;Jose Ferrer excels as the defense lawyer. While he would much rather be prosecuting, he does a superb job of defending his client.  Of interest is why the cast on his hand?  Did the actor have an injury at the time or was it a part of the storyline later edited out?ENS Keith portrayed by a young, up and coming actor who would tragically die before his career could take off in a plane crash portrays the gullible officer very well.All in all, an outstanding film for the time and a timeless classic.",5,Outstanding cast and disc,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,2020,"['Was', 'cautious', 'ordering', 'Blu-Ray', 'due', 'many', 'reviews', 'Mine', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'quality', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Blu-Ray', 'also', 'included', 'extra', 'features', 'making', 'of.About', 'movie', 'itself.Many', 'have', 'stated', 'romance', 'ENS', 'Keith', 'May', 'added', 'nothing', 'movie', 'submit', 'did', 'young-inexperienced', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'caught', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'wished', 'control', 'mother', 'girlfriend', 'also', 'gullible', 'young', 'officer', 'who', 'had', 'utmost', 'respect', 'authority', 'stated', 'Keefer', 'movie', '34', 'sic', 'Willie', 'one', 'day', 'have', 'learn', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'fathers', 'ships', 'captains.', '34', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'fine', 'subtle', 'performance', 'commanding', 'officer', 'trying', 'restore', 'military', 'regs', 'tired', 'crew', 'ship', 'later', 'part', 'WWII', '34', 'deer', 'headlight', '34', 'looks', 'towline', 'being', 'steamed', 'typhoon', 'show', 'quality', 'actor', 'Even', 'dramatic', 'testimony', 'court', 'martial', 'carefully', 'tapered', 'climb', 'prove', 'defense', 'case.Fred', 'MacMurray', 'stellar', 'performance', 'slimy', 'officer', 'who', 'pot', 'Putting', 'ideas', 'heads', 'not', 'as', 'smart', 'getting', 'thoughts', 'turn', 'way', 'thinking', 'Watching', 'continually', 'push', 'XO', 'captain', 'ability', 'command', 'then', 'listening', 'testimony', 'court', 'martial', 'classic', 'Even', 'when', 'Keith', 'word', 'master', 'LT', 'Keefer', 'states', '34', 'yes', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing.', '34', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'excels', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'be', 'prosecuting', 'superb', 'job', 'defending', 'client', 'interest', 'why', 'cast', 'hand', 'Did', 'actor', 'have', 'injury', 'time', 'was', 'part', 'storyline', 'later', 'edited', 'out', 'ENS', 'Keith', 'portrayed', 'young', 'up', 'coming', 'actor', 'who', 'would', 'tragically', 'die', 'career', 'could', 'take', 'off', 'plane', 'crash', 'gullible', 'officer', 'very', 'well.All', 'outstanding', 'film', 'time', 'timeless', 'classic']",N/A

Caine, a ramshackle minesweeper.  Captained by the lax Tom Tully, nominated for a supporting actor Oscar, playing Commander DeVriess, the ship is populated by a loosely disciplined crew far from the spit and polish Francis was expecting.  Francis is shown the ropes by cynical and critical communications officer and part time author, Lt. Keefer played by Fred McMurray.  Francis soon learns that the executive officer Lt. Maryk played by the well grounded Van Johnson actually keeps things running smoothly aboard the ship.The crew with the exception of Francis is saddened to learn that DeVriess is being replaced in command by a new captain, Lt. Commander Queeg played by the aging but still superb Humphrey Bogart.  Queeg, a strict disciplinarian, soon gains the ire of the crew with his petty rules and perfectionism.  A few mishaps during naval excercises have the men questioning Bogart's mettle and fitness for command.  McMurray postulates that Bogart is mentally unstable and showing signs of paranoia.  He plants the seeds in the mind of Johnson that he should assume command of the ship.  Johnson however will have none of that.Queeg's personality problems finally come to a head when he mounts a shipwide investigation to reveal the mechanism behind the disappearance of a quart of strawberries.  Queeg who calms himself by rolling around a pair of steel balls in his hand really loses it when the Caine gets pummelled in the teeth of a murderous Pacific typhoon.  Frozen in terror with the ship foundering, he is unable to make a command decision and Johnson seconded by the young Francis relieves Bogart of his command.The mutinous action leads to a court martial of Johnson and Francis.  The men are reluctantly defended by Jose Ferrer playing Lt. Greenwald.  McMurray the procreator of the plot turns coward on the stand lying about his involvement.  Their doomed fates appear to be sealed due to the work of cunning prosecutor Lt. Commander Challee played by frequent silver screen barrister E.G. Marshall.  Cross examination by Ferrer of Bogart is a terrific and memorable scene causes Bogey, in a brilliant acting performance to crack up on the stand.Wouk's novel and Dmytryk's portrayal of it accurately detail a previously tabooed revelation of the effect of battle fatique on the ability to make command decisions.

9957,ANIHXYXKPZL2H,0767809688,"C. Roberts ""movie buff""","[23, 24]","Humphrey Bogart gives another top rated powerful performance in this classic drama with a first rate professional cast including Fred MacMurray, Van Johnson, Jose Ferrer, E.G. Marshall, Tom Tully, Lee Marvin, Robert Francis, Claude Atkins, and Arthur Franz.Captain Phillip Queeg (Humphrey Bogart) is in command of the USS Caine. Very unpopular with the men he gradually becomes more and more paranoid and his chief officers believe he is no longer competent to be in charge of the ship. His Executive Officer Lt Steve Maryk (Van Johnson) suspects that Queeg is a very sick man and not fit to command the ship due to his wild and erratic behaviour. Lt Tom Keefer (Fred MacMurray) feels the same way but is not prepared to make a stand against the Captain. During a violent storm Queeg loses his nerve and Maryk takes over the command only to be accused by Queeg of mutiny. (&quot;Mr Maryk, if you question my decision once more I'll order you off this bridge&quot;. - Bogart to Van Johnson). Maryk does take over the ship against Queeg's wishes and when back on land charges of mutiny are brought against him. The trial that follows forms the main focus of the film (and for me it was the most interesting) with some very tense and impressively acted dramatic scenes showing Bogart at his best. Lt Barney Greenwald (Jose Ferrer) is engaged as defending counsel for Maryk who is being charged with mutiny. However, things begin to look very bad for Maryk when Tom Keefer is called to give evidence and fails to support him. Some other witnesses are also unable (or reluctant) to show that Queeg was unfit to command the ship and Greenwald appears to be losing his case. Then Captain Queeg is called to the stand and has to face some strong questioning from Greenwald leading to the dramatic climax of the film.Some favourite lines from the film:Humphrey Bogart (to crew): &quot;You people think you're very clever, but you're not fooling me&quot;.Bogart (to Van Johnson): &quot;Mr Maryk, you may tell the crew for me there are four ways of doing things aboard my ship. The right way, the wrong way, the navy way, and my way - they do things my way we'll get along&quot;.Johnson (to Fred MacMurray): &quot;I don't get it. Is the captain off his head or isn't he? Is this record I've kept correct or not?&quot;.Johnson (to Bogart): &quot;Captain, I'm sorry, but you're a sick man. I'm relieving you as captain of this ship under article 184&quot;.Bogart (to officers): &quot;You'll all hang for conspiracy for mutiny&quot;.Bogart (on witness stand): &quot;Ah .... but the strawberries! That's where I had them. They laughed at me and made jokes, but I proved beyond a shadow of a doubt, and with geometric logic, that a duplicate key to the wardroom icebox did exist&quot;.Jose Ferrer (to the officers): &quot;Sure, I got a guilty conscience. I defended you Steve because I thought the wrong man was on trial. So I torpedoed Queeg for you. I had to torpedo him and I feel sick about it&quot;.&quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; was directed by Edward Dmytryk who was also responsible for &quot;Raintree County&quot;, &quot;The Young Lions&quot; and many other classic films. &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; was remade as a TV movie in 1988 with Eric Bogosian, Jeff Daniels, Brad Davis and Peter Gallagher. I have never seen this so I can't comment on it. However, I did see the Bogart version several times and doubt if anything else could come up to that standard. TV movies are seldom as good as the big screen originals.Bogart was nominated for the Best Actor &quot;Oscar&quot; for his performance in this film but was unfortunately beaten by Marlon Brando in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. The film received a nomination for Best Picture but the award again went to &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;.

That bare bones version was widely panned for its poor transfer, which featured an overabundance of digital noise and was presented in basic stereo.Those failings have been corrected for this most recent digitally remastered release. Here we are presented with a quite exceptional picture and soundtrack and a nice smattering of special features.Based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Herman Wouk the film (which itself was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1954) details the tension between the captain of a World War II era minesweeper (played superbly by Humphrey Bogart) and his crew. Bogart's character is overly paranoid and viewed by some as displaying cowardice in the face of battle.Playing the part of the executive officer, Lt. Steve Maryk is Van Johnson who, spurred on by third in command, the spineless Lt. Keefer (Fred MacMurray), finally takes control of the ship when the safety of the ship and crew are threatened. Queeg's stubborn insistences to maintain the heading of the ship in a typhoon, flying in the face of good seamanship, forces Maryk to take action and he, along with Ensign Keith, are charged with mutiny upon return to port.It is here that the movie truly shines. Reluctantly defending the two is the always-excellent Jose Ferrer, and the scene where he interrogates Queeg on the stand is spellbinding.Complimenting the movie Columbia have added an interesting scene specific audio commentary by Program Director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center Richard Pena and filmmaker and producer Ken Bowser. The two detail the difficulties the filmmakers initially faced when confronted with an initially uncooperative Department of he Navy, careers of the actors involved and the context of the film in relation to  a political environment that saw Hollywood filmmakers blacklisted.Apparently the Navy has never had a mutiny onboard one of its ships (a fact which leads to the placement of a disclaimer to the beginning of the picture) and they were none too pleased with the fictitious account. However, following a change in command, they reversed their decision and offered the use of dockyards, ships, aircraft carrier and even real sailors for the movie.Both Pena and Bowser return for the two-part documentary on the making of the movie. Running for 18:48 and 16:16 respectively they are joined by Film Critic Bob Castle.The three begin by discussing the mood in Hollywood at the time. Apparently movie audiences declined rapidly from 1946 to 1962 with the advent of television and greater foreign competition and so a nervous industry was looking for a ""sure bet."" Producer Stanley Kramer had bought the film rights to ""The Caine Mutiny"" book before it became a bestseller for $60,000. The book was a major selling point that led to the producers being able to cast the movie with a strong ensemble. Castle mentions some of the un-credited roles to illustrate this and Bogart reportedly read the book and actively campaigned for the role of the captain.Rounding out the special features are trailers for ""Walking Tall: The Payback,"" ""Hard Luck"" and ""Edison Force."" None bear any thematic connection with the main feature.Recommended",5,Improved picture and sound - easy to recommend,1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,3708,"['tradition', 'television', 'stations', 'show', 'selection', 'war', 'movies', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'holiday', 'fast', 'becoming', 'tradition', 'studios', 'release', 'slew', 'war', 'themed', 'DVDs', 'celebrate', 'contribution', 'nation', 'veterans', 'time', 'last', 'Monday', 'May.Special', 'mention', 'year', 'Columbia', 'who', 'are', 'releasing', 'collector', 'editions', 'two', 'classics', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'afforded', 'release', 'shiny', 'silver', 'discs.First', 'up', 'Caine', 'Mutiny', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'DVD', 'back', 'late', '1998', 'bare', 'version', 'was', 'widely', 'panned', 'poor', 'transfer', 'featured', 'overabundance', 'digital', 'noise', 'was', 'presented', 'basic', 'stereo.Those', 'failings', 'have', 'been', 'corrected', 'most', 'recent', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'release', 'Here', 'are', 'presented', 'quite', 'exceptional', 'picture', 'soundtrack', 'nice', 'smattering', 'special', 'features.Based', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize-winning', 'novel', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'seven', 'Academy', 'Awards', '1954', 'details', 'tension', 'captain', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'era', 'minesweeper', 'played', 'superbly', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'crew', 'Bogart', 'character', 'overly', 'paranoid', 'viewed', 'displaying', 'cowardice', 'face', 'battle.Playing', 'part', 'executive', 'officer', 'Lt.', 'Steve', 'Maryk', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'who', 'spurred', 'third', 'command', 'spineless', 'Lt.', 'Keefer', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'finally', 'control', 'ship', 'when', 'safety', 'ship', 'crew', 'are', 'threatened', 'Queeg', 'stubborn', 'insistences', 'maintain', 'heading', 'ship', 'typhoon', 'flying', 'face', 'good', 'seamanship', 'forces', 'Maryk', 'take', 'action', 'Ensign', 'Keith', 'are', 'charged', 'mutiny', 'upon', 'return', 'port.It', 'here', 'movie', 'truly', 'shines', 'Reluctantly', 'defending', 'two', 'always-excellent', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'scene', 'where', 'Queeg', 'stand', 'spellbinding.Complimenting', 'movie', 'Columbia', 'have', 'added', 'interesting', 'scene', 'specific', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Program', 'Director', 'Film', 'Society', 'Lincoln', 'Center', 'Richard', 'Pena', 'filmmaker', 'producer', 'Ken', 'Bowser', 'two', 'detail', 'difficulties', 'filmmakers', 'initially', 'faced', 'when', 'confronted', 'initially', 'uncooperative', 'Department', 'Navy', 'careers', 'actors', 'involved', 'context', 'film', 'relation', 'political', 'environment', 'saw', 'Hollywood', 'filmmakers', 'blacklisted.Apparently', 'Navy', 'never', 'had', 'mutiny', 'onboard', 'one', 'ships', 'fact', 'placement', 'disclaimer', 'beginning', 'picture', 'were', 'none', 'too', 'pleased', 'fictitious', 'account', 'However', 'following', 'change', 'command', 'reversed', 'decision', 'offered', 'use', 'dockyards', 'ships', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'even', 'real', 'sailors', 'movie.Both', 'Pena', 'Bowser', 'return', 'two-part', 'documentary', 'making', 'movie', 'Running', '18:48', '16:16', 'respectively', 'are', 'joined', 'Film', 'Critic', 'Bob', 'Castle.The', 'three', 'begin', 'discussing', 'mood', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'Apparently', 'movie', 'audiences', 'declined', 'rapidly', '1946', '1962', 'advent', 'television', 'greater', 'foreign', 'competition', 'so', 'nervous', 'industry', 'was', 'looking', 'sure', 'bet', 'Producer', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'had', 'bought', 'film', 'rights', 'Caine', 'Mutiny', 'book', 'became', 'bestseller', '60,000', 'book', 'was', 'major', 'selling', 'point', 'led', 'producers', 'being', 'able', 'cast', 'movie', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'Castle', 'un-credited', 'roles', 'illustrate', 'Bogart', 'reportedly', 'read', 'book', 'actively', 'campaigned', 'role', 'captain.Rounding', 'out', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'trailers', 'Walking', 'Payback', 'Hard', 'Luck', 'Edison', 'Force', 'None', 'thematic', 'connection', 'main', 'feature.Recommended']",N/A

Even worse, what do you do during a world war in this situation?  These are the kinds of questions asked by the present film.Humphery Bogart plays a paranoid and eccentric captain who has been assigned to command the CAINE.  Fred MacMurray plays the insightful (although spineless) 3rd in command.  The name of the ship is somewhat symbolic as the biblical brother-against-brother evolves into a story of sailor-vs.-sailor (and officer-vs.-officer).What pushes this film across the waves are the Naval politics of the supreme position of a commanding officer.  In a perfect world, nobody would ever dispute a captain's authority.  In a less than perfect world, captains can become delusional and lose their ability to think clearly.  The choices the crew makes in these episodes forms the crux of the plot.The film is well done and is filmed just 10 years after WWII.  Therefore, many of the ships depicted likely really did see combat during the epic struggle.  The acting is top-notch, especially with Bogey having the unusual role of a character who is prone to making mistakes.On the downside, the soundtrack is way, way over-done.  It shows how far Hollywood has come in the past 50 years to make soundtracks that complement the movie instead of constantly being overly-dramatic.Also, I found the love-interest between the ensign and his girlfriend to be a bit of an after-thought.  It never really seemed to ""fit"" with the rest of the film.  But, that's just me.If you're a fan of Naval movies, this classic is a must-see.

9975,A30T2B7RFWGYNU,0767809688,FRED C. DOBBS,"[2, 2]","This is a GREAT movie and one of my all-time favorites. Just when you thought Bogey was packing it in he provides us with one last great performance. He plays Commander Philip Francis Queeg, the Captain of a US naval ship during WW2. The veteran Queeg appears to be an eccentric, aloof and pompous old tyke. He is surrounded by a basically much younger bunch of subservient officers who probably wish they had one half of his experience and bark. The group is led by the second-in-command Lieutenant Steve Maryk played by the always charismatic vet actor Van Johnson. Fred MacMurray, a vastly underrated performer [remember his all-time UNFORGETTABLE kick-butt performance in DOUBLE IMDEMNITY, 1944] plays Lieutenant Tom Keefer, a self-serving, judgmental, know-it-all sycophant. Eyebrows are continually raised onboard with Queeg's increasingly odd behavior. The ""strawberries"" caper is a beaut. The level-headed and practical Maryk seems to brush things off as normal aging and long-time-out-in-the-sea quirks while the perturbingly intrusive Keefer defines Queeg as a paranoid loon. Things come to a head during a nocturnal typhoon that threatens to upend the ship. Queeg, called to the bridge as the ship is being rocked, makes the wrong calls, is questioned and ultimately breaks down. As Queeg freezes with lives at stake Maryk, citing Naval regulations, relieves Queeg of duty and takes over command of the ship. This is a stirring scene. Maryk is able to save the ship but he, along with all his officers, are accused of mutiny and court-martialled. Things look bleak as there are no lawyers willing to take the case. Jose Ferrer plays the military lawyer willing to give it a shot. Ferrer is perfect for this role. Courtroom interrogation, banter and repartee is lots of fun but most evocative is Ferrer's final verbal assault and denudation of Queeg's psyche. The sight of a tired, lonely, neglected and war-beaten Queeg, sitting and twirling his fetish-like metal spheres in his hand to a disturbing clicking sound is memorable and worth the price of your ticket. But it isn't over yet as the masterful Ferrer uses the post-acquittal party to unload on the saved officers---some prima donnas, some passive-aggressive, some not having a clue as to what part of the system failed. Ferrer's drunken exposition and rebuke of MacMurray's character and his final challenge is a CLASSIC and can't be missed. Ferrer is AWESOME. Indeed, Queeg was part of a system [military] where teamwork is essential for success as well as survival. Unfortunately, often leaders are envied, despised and even ostracized by their men, and neglected and objectified by a system that frowns upon, and may not be willing to recognize, mental dissolution. Queeg had no one who would listen for the purpose of helping him, but there were many who would listen to excise him. Bogart's performance was terrific---poignant, detached, marvelously underplayed for the stars around him---further cementing his status as an icon of American cinema.",5,BOGEY NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE IN MARITIME CLASSIC,1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,3023,"['GREAT', 'movie', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'Bogey', 'was', 'packing', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'performance', 'Commander', 'Philip', 'Francis', 'Queeg', 'Captain', 'US', 'naval', 'ship', 'WW2', 'veteran', 'Queeg', 'be', 'eccentric', 'aloof', 'pompous', 'old', 'tyke', 'surrounded', 'basically', 'much', 'younger', 'bunch', 'subservient', 'officers', 'who', 'probably', 'wish', 'had', 'one', 'half', 'experience', 'bark', 'group', 'led', 'second-in-command', 'Lieutenant', 'Steve', 'Maryk', 'played', 'always', 'charismatic', 'vet', 'actor', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'performer', '[', 'remember', 'all-time', 'UNFORGETTABLE', 'kick-butt', 'performance', 'DOUBLE', 'IMDEMNITY', '1944', ']', 'Lieutenant', 'Tom', 'Keefer', 'self-serving', 'judgmental', 'know-it-all', 'sycophant', 'Eyebrows', 'are', 'continually', 'raised', 'onboard', 'Queeg', 'increasingly', 'odd', 'behavior', 'strawberries', 'caper', 'beaut', 'level-headed', 'practical', 'Maryk', 'brush', 'things', 'off', 'normal', 'aging', 'long-time-out-in-the-sea', 'quirks', 'perturbingly', 'intrusive', 'Keefer', 'Queeg', 'paranoid', 'loon', 'Things', 'come', 'head', 'nocturnal', 'typhoon', 'upend', 'ship', 'Queeg', 'called', 'bridge', 'ship', 'being', 'rocked', 'wrong', 'calls', 'questioned', 'ultimately', 'breaks', 'down', 'Queeg', 'lives', 'stake', 'Maryk', 'citing', 'Naval', 'regulations', 'Queeg', 'duty', 'command', 'ship', 'stirring', 'scene', 'Maryk', 'able', 'save', 'ship', 'officers', 'are', 'accused', 'mutiny', 'court-martialled', 'Things', 'look', 'bleak', 'are', 'lawyers', 'willing', 'take', 'case', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'military', 'lawyer', 'willing', 'give', 'shot', 'Ferrer', 'perfect', 'role', 'Courtroom', 'interrogation', 'banter', 'repartee', 'lots', 'fun', 'most', 'evocative', 'Ferrer', 'final', 'verbal', 'assault', 'denudation', 'Queeg', 'psyche', 'sight', 'tired', 'lonely', 'neglected', 'war-beaten', 'Queeg', 'sitting', 'twirling', 'fetish-like', 'metal', 'spheres', 'hand', 'disturbing', 'clicking', 'sound', 'memorable', 'worth', 'price', 'ticket', ""n't"", 'over', 'yet', 'masterful', 'Ferrer', 'post-acquittal', 'party', 'unload', 'saved', 'officers', '-some', 'prima', 'donnas', 'passive-aggressive', 'not', 'having', 'clue', 'what', 'part', 'system', 'failed', 'Ferrer', 'drunken', 'exposition', 'rebuke', 'MacMurray', 'character', 'final', 'challenge', 'CLASSIC', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed', 'Ferrer', 'AWESOME', 'Indeed', 'Queeg', 'was', 'part', 'system', '[', 'military', ']', 'where', 'teamwork', 'essential', 'success', 'as', 'well', 'survival', 'Unfortunately', 'often', 'leaders', 'are', 'envied', 'despised', 'even', 'ostracized', 'men', 'neglected', 'objectified', 'system', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'willing', 'recognize', 'mental', 'dissolution', 'Queeg', 'had', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'listen', 'purpose', 'helping', 'were', 'many', 'who', 'would', 'listen', 'excise', 'Bogart', 'performance', 'was', 'terrific', '-poignant', 'detached', 'marvelously', 'underplayed', 'stars', 'cementing', 'status', 'icon', 'American', 'cinema']",N/A
9976,A1UYL5GIQ8YE77,0767809688,Fred L. Houpt,"[3, 29]","Having not seen this film or having read the novel, I approached itwith no preconceived notions other that so many on IMDb have given thefilm so many accolades. Alas, I will not be joining that group.Watching this film in early 2012 I was confronted with a depiction thatwas overtly jingoistic and so fawning towards the US Navy, that I foundthe preening gestures to be detracting, robbing the story of anypossible objectivity in the story telling. While I am not unaware thatevery film will mirror the times in which it is crafted, I found themusical score to be mediocre and too strenuously fixated withreproducing a gallant and martial atmosphere. Subtlety this film hadnone. Some critics have noted and I will agree with them that the firsthalf of the film really drags. I also feel that the romanticperegrinations of Ensign Willie Keith are unnecessary, weakly depictedand developed. Watching it now made me cringe, with the watered downtension of his divided loyalties towards his mother and the woman heasserts he is in love with just comes across as unconvincing, drainedof real passion, conviction and angst. It doesn't help the movie thatthe two actors playing the roles had practically no sparks betweenthem. That entire part of the film, even if it is in the book, couldhave been left out.My impression of Bogart as the mentally unhinged Captain was that hewas miscast for this role. Bogey, for me at least, was too wooden,stiff, an obvious land lubber trying to make himself look like aseasoned sea dog and I didn't buy it for a moment. I kept on waitingfor him to pop a cigarette in his mouth but not once is he seensmoking, which, as hilarious as it might sound from a health point ofview, was his trade mark in so many of his films. Another thing I wasquite surprised at was how short he was. Every time he stood beside VanJohnson or Fred MacMurray, both quite tall men, Bogey look so muchsmaller, which of course he was.Much has been made of his recourse to fidgeting with with balls of somemetal, and even if it is in the novel, the way he acts this out lookscontrived and with no subtly. Imagine if it was Charles Laughtonportraying this captain as he had on the film ""Mutiny on the Bounty""?Bogart's Captain is portrayed more as someone who is severely analretentive, given to ridiculous attention to details that have about asmuch place on a minesweeper as they would on a chain gang. That type ofspit and polish with harsh consequences for insubordination belonged ona big battle ship, not a rusting hulk.I found the emotional projections of every single person in the film tobe too cautious, unnatural, forced, self conscious of being an ""act"".Fred MacMurray, a talented actor, hardly breaks away from hismonochromatic portrayal, and strangely so. The only person in the filmwho evoked a few moments of real emotion was Jose Ferrer, whosesneering revulsion for the defendants is a welcome jolt of a realmoment of conviction.A word about special effects and stock footage. The film used threesources to show the boats. One was shot either on a stage or on a realboat, another was stock footage from WW2 and the weakest was the modelship being shot in a large tub. The model scenes looked at today willonly make you laugh. I suppose that in 1954 people didn't much care ifthe ship looked like a toy; they focused on the overall story. I amsomeone grown accustomed to quality effects and looked at now, thestorm tossed boat looks silly and amateurish.The premise of the drama is not impossible to conjure but I felt thatit lacked enough life and death held in the balance to convince me.Bogart's reaction to seeing the mutinous defendants outside the courtroom was typical of how odd the relationships were. He was not theleast bit perturbed by seeing them and he greeted them as friends. Thecourt room drama was the strongest part of the film and I will grantthat watching Bogart's character fall apart was the climax of the film.However, it was a short moment in what is otherwise a rather dreary andmuted film. You would think that the actions taken in the middle of atyphoon to save everyone on board from imminent drowning would haveevoked a stronger reaction from all concerned but you won't find ithere. I was bothered that the film does not tell you what became ofBogart's character, Captain Queeg. All that we know is that thedefendants won their case and that Queeg lost. I found the lack offollow through to be a weak point. All in all, the film looks verydated, the actors all look devoid of conviction and by comparisons toother boat films, this one is flat. Not impressed. Go and look at whatLaughton and Gable did on the other Mutiny film and then you'll seeaction worth writing accolades for.

9978,A3BWP965RIWBCU,0767809688,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[1, 1]","Since so many Amazon reviews of ""The Caine Mutiny"" (many of them excellent assessments of this great motion picture) exist already (as of May 2014, when I am writing this), I here would like mostly to praise this film as a very fine, cunningly wrought adaptation to the screen of Herman Wouk's enthralling novel. I read the book a few years ago, long before seeing the movie only recently. Having served for a few years of active duty as an enlisted man in the U.S. Navy, novels and films of this kind are of intense interest to me. The DVD edition which I viewed is one of the four discs in the boxed set of three great war films (plus a bonus disc), ""W.W. II, 60th Anniversary Collection"" (Sony Films Home Entertainment 11527).The film very wisely limits its adaptation to the core of the novel, from the graduation of Ensign Willie Keith (played by Robert Charles Francis) from training at a reserve officer training programme to the conclusion of the military tribunal that results in the U.S. Navy's reluctant condemnation of the skipper of the Caine (a destroyer/mine sweeper), Lt. Cdr. Philip Francis Queeg (played by Humphrey Bogart) and the consequent vindication of the ship's executive officer, Lt. Steve Maryk (acted by Van Johson), who during the severe duress of a typhoon at sea, relieves Queeg of his command of the Caine, which Queeg's appallingly bad seamanship and lack of sound judgment put into danger.Anyone who has never been through such dangerous weather at sea on such a small vessel can only imagine how arduous it is for a ship and its crew to survive it. While serving on a destroyer in the Navy (in the Atlantic Fleet, not the Pacific), I experienced on two different occasions the full fury of hurricane at sea, so I greatly admire how well the film so vividly depicts the Caine struggling to stay afloat and not to capsize in such frightening conditions.At film's conclusion, one sees Keith's return (now as a Lt. j.g.) to the Caine. One particularly interesting event from Wouk's novel that takes place after Keefer's and Keith's further time on the Caine is a viciously damaging Japanese kamikaze attack on the ship, which it very nearly sinks, a fate which the Caine avoids due to Keith's leadership and bravery. Keefer has been the skipper at first (following Queeg's hearing), faring poorly in that function, then Keith rises to command. Truth to tell, there is so much good material just in the early and later parts of Wouk's novel that a full movie, entertaining and gripping, could be made mostly from the portions earlier and later in Wouk's book which the movie, ""The Caine Mutiny"", albeit wisely, passes over.Limiting the film to this central concern of Wouk's novel, however, makes it possible to do some really artistic justice to Wouk's novel, which, short of resulting in a film of monumental length, could not treat the entire work so satisfactorily without that self-imposed limitation. The novel itself, in its earlier pages, traces Keith's civilian life, university studies, and Naval training, as well as the beginning of his romance with his lady love, and, after the time of the action which the film depicts, the book also portrays his further naval career right through to the end of W.W. II.There are many incidents aboard the Caine, in Wouk's novel, that one so would like to see treated on screen, but which had to be omitted or truncated to make of ""The Caine Mutiny"" a film of reasonable length. One that I particularly miss is the depiction of the full extent of Queeg's cowardice, and Keith's contrasting courage, in the ""Yellow Stain incident"", when Queeg deliberately avoids the fire from a shore battery as he abandons an invading landing party to its fate without the Caine's protective cover of it; during it, Queeg's movements on the bridge do not occur according to best military advantage, but rather to his own personal safety.On the other hand, the movie's treatment of the tribunal's hearings is brilliant, better paced and motivated, in fact, than in the novel itself! The cinematic portrayal of the Naval lawyer's, Lt. Barry Greenwald's, handling Maryk's defense (which Jos&eacute; Ferrer acts out) is more effective, less indulgent, and more convincing than Wouk's handling of Greenwald, nearly eliminating the lawyer's Jewish priggishness, to welcome effect. As for Lt. Tom Keefer's treacherous betrayal of Maryk and Keith, Fred McMurray's acting and the screenplay's deft portrayal of Keefer's moral turpitude and false bravado do full justice to what readers of Wouk's novel itself experience of this man's despicably weak and manipulative character.There is so much more that one could say, and that has been said in other Amazon reviews, about this great film, but I limit myself to what I describe here, hopeful that readers of this review will go on to read yet other Amazon comments on the motion picture in order to form a more fully rounded idea of what this great work of the screen is all about and how stunning are the acting, filmography, and all the rest of it!",5,"A Tremendous Naval War Movie, One That Very Artfully Captures Very Successfully the

9980,A7QNV4G4DXMQL,0767809688,H50 1.0 FOREVER,"[1, 1]","Although &#34;The Caine Mutiny&#34; was fictitious, it was filmed aboard a real US Navy ship, the USS Hamilton (DMS-18). The USS Hamilton was a Wickes class destroyer, commissioned in 1919. In 1941, it was reclassified a minesweeper. After serving in the war, it was decommissioned in 1946.In the movie, DMS-18 was known as the USS Caine. It was based in San Francisco and served in the Pacific during World War II. As such, it stopped at Pearl Harbor for refueling and servicing.Distant scenes of O'ahu were seen in the movie. Although it was difficult to make out the details, one thing was abundantly clear: There were no skyscrapers, and very few neighborhoods ran up the valleys between the ridges of the Ko'olau Mountains. The pink-colored Tripler Army Hospital was not visible, although it had been built at the time the movie was filmed. What was visible, however, were cranes at Pearl Harbor. Were they there to hoist ships into dry dock or to assist in the rebuilding of Pearl Harbor? We were not told.Mentioned, but not seen, in the movie was real-life Flt Adm William Halsey, who commanded the Third Fleet. Alluded to in the movie was Typhoon Cobra in which, again in real life, Adm Halsey ordered his fleet to remain at sea despite the approaching typhoon. Three destroyers went down, more than 70 were damaged, more than 800 lives were lost, and more than 300 aircraft were lost. Halsey lost his command as a result of his poor decision but was not court-martialed, since part of the blame belonged to weather forecasters in Hawai'i, who had thought the storm would take a more northerly path.In the movie, the captain of the Caine (Humphrey Bogart) failed to give instructions to change the ship's course, nearly resulting in its foundering. It was his cowardice that resulted, coupled with other poor decisions on his part, that led to the mutiny.  At the court-martial of two men accused of mutiny, Bogart went slowly to pieces, reflecting paranoia as he blamed everyone but himself for problems on the Caine. He did so beautifully. Not many actors can play insanity convincingly, but Bogart did.Review first published on my website, www.memoriesofhawaiifive-0.com.",5,The Well-Acted Blending of Fiction and Historical Fact,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,2182,"['34', 'Caine', 'Mutiny', '34', 'was', 'fictitious', 'was', 'filmed', 'real', 'US', 'Navy', 'ship', 'USS', 'Hamilton', 'DMS-18', 'USS', 'Hamilton', 'was', 'Wickes', 'class', 'destroyer', 'commissioned', '1919', '1941', 'was', 'reclassified', 'minesweeper', 'serving', 'war', 'was', 'decommissioned', '1946.In', 'movie', 'DMS-18', 'was', 'known', 'USS', 'Caine', 'was', 'based', 'San', 'Francisco', 'served', 'Pacific', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'such', 'stopped', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'refueling', 'servicing.Distant', 'scenes', ""O'ahu"", 'were', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'difficult', 'make', 'out', 'details', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'were', 'skyscrapers', 'very', 'few', 'neighborhoods', 'ran', 'up', 'valleys', 'ridges', ""Ko'olau"", 'Mountains', 'pink-colored', 'Tripler', 'Army', 'Hospital', 'was', 'not', 'visible', 'had', 'been', 'built', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'What', 'was', 'visible', 'however', 'were', 'cranes', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Were', 'there', 'hoist', 'ships', 'dry', 'dock', 'assist', 'rebuilding', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'were', 'not', 'told.Mentioned', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'real-life', 'Flt', 'Adm', 'William', 'Halsey', 'who', 'commanded', 'Third', 'Fleet', 'Alluded', 'movie', 'was', 'Typhoon', 'Cobra', 'again', 'real', 'life', 'Adm', 'Halsey', 'ordered', 'fleet', 'remain', 'sea', 'approaching', 'typhoon', 'Three', 'destroyers', 'went', 'down', 'more', '70', 'were', 'damaged', 'more', '800', 'lives', 'were', 'lost', 'more', '300', 'aircraft', 'were', 'lost', 'lost', 'command', 'result', 'poor', 'decision', 'was', 'not', 'court-martialed', 'part', 'blame', 'belonged', 'weather', 'forecasters', 'Hawai', 'i', 'who', 'had', 'thought', 'storm', 'would', 'take', 'more', 'northerly', 'path.In', 'movie', 'captain', 'Caine', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'failed', 'give', 'instructions', 'change', 'ship', 'course', 'nearly', 'resulting', 'foundering', 'was', 'cowardice', 'resulted', 'coupled', 'other', 'poor', 'decisions', 'part', 'led', 'mutiny', 'court-martial', 'two', 'men', 'accused', 'mutiny', 'Bogart', 'went', 'slowly', 'pieces', 'reflecting', 'paranoia', 'blamed', 'everyone', 'problems', 'Caine', 'did', 'so', 'beautifully', 'Not', 'many', 'actors', 'can', 'play', 'insanity', 'convincingly', 'Bogart', 'did.Review', 'first', 'published', 'website', 'www.memoriesofhawaiifive-0.com']",N/A

9982,A26HFSVLAGULIM,0767809688,"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[0, 2]","IN A NUTSHELL: A COMPLEX LOOK INTO THE HUMAN MIND UNDER STRESSEssentially, as we later learn, the Caine Mutiny occurs, in part, because of the constant undermining of Captain Queeg's [Bogart] authority by Lieutenant Keefer [MacMurray], the Caine's 3rd in command. Is Queeg really crazy or was he pushed over the edge.WHAT THE 'CAINE MUTINY' IS ALL ABOUT: [PLOT SPOILERS BELOW]The 'Caine Mutiny' is a very tightly scripted character driven story about the effects of stress and treachery on board an American naval warship during World War 2 in the Pacific theatre. Unlike stories, such as, 'Mutiny On the Bounty', the villian is NOT the Captain, but another officer in the background who insidiously instigates actions to be taken by other officers against the Captain. That officer is Lt. Tom Keefer [Fred MacMurray] who is the Caine's Communications Officer, and third in command of the Caine. He doesn't like Captain Queeg, probably because Queeg banned Keefer's daily novel writing activities after a foul-up, where Keefer was the 'Officer of The Deck'. From that point on Keefer continuously undermined Queeg's authority, safely behind his back, to the point where the 1st officer, Lt. Steve Maryk [Van Johnson] was keeping a medical log regarding the Captain's unstable behavior, the other officers were singing songs with derogatory lyrics about the Captain, like 'The Yellowstain Blues' and the Captain was forced to function entirely without the support of his officers and crew.What followed was inevitable; at the point of maximum stress during a typhoon where the Caine was in danger of foundering, Captain Queeg become dysfunctionally catatonic and Lt. Maryk was forced to relieve him of command under article 184 of Naval Regs. Keefer had recited this article to Maryk some months earlier and stated, ""this is required reading aboard the Caine"", in his usual glib and derogatory way.AND THEN THERE IS THE TRIAL: ""LIKE SHOOTING FISH IN A BARREL"" - LT. GREENWALDSorting out this mess starts with the defense attorney, Lt. Barney Greenwald's, [Jose Ferrer] first scene. Almost immediately he realizes that ""the wrong man is on trial"", after he asks Keefer a couple of preliminary questions in the conference room. Keefer rather uncomfortably ajourns to the hallway as a result of the scrutiny, and Greenwald takes the case, though he states, ""I WOULD MUCH RATHER PROSECUTE"". Obviously, he means he would like to prosecute Mister Keefer, but this only becomes certain at the party after the acquital when Mister Greenwald tells the story of the Caine Mutiny to the officers of that tragic vessel and Mister Keefer's spineless involvement which he [Keefer] had hoped would pass unnoticed.-----> THE CAST &lt;-----Humphrey Bogart  - Capt.

Keefer, played by Fred MacMurray is the true villian and ""author of the Caine Mutiny"", and his spineless backstabbing methods make him a revolting character in the end, though he started out as a glib and engaging character, at least on the surface. Jose Ferrer as Lt. Greenwald, the defense attorney, brings into focus for our examination, the truth behind the Caine Mutiny.Other roles, such as Van Johnson as 1st Officer Maryk, E.G. Marshall as Prosecutor Challee, Whit Bissell as the Psychiatrist for the Prosecution, Lt. Cmdr. Dickson, really aid in telling the story during the trial. But there are many other roles played quite well on the ship, and there's the subplot of the 'Ensign Kieth coming-of-age story'. All of this contributes to an excellent and wholly believable film which ends almost as it begins with Ensign Kieth [Robert Francis] meeting his first Captain, Capt. DeVriess [Tom Tully] aboard his new ship, this time a destroyer more to both mens' liking. This time both men seem more ready for what lies ahead, Kieth has grown-up and Captain DeVries now seems much more like a Captain to the new and improved Ensign Kieth. Captain DeVries orders Kieth to 'take her out', meaning the ship, which indicates to us, after a tense moment that these two men are going to let-bygones-be-bygones. It is a nice note to end on.",5,A DIDACTIC MORAL STORY HAS NEVER BEEN SO ENTERTAINING,1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,6974,"['IN', 'A', 'NUTSHELL', 'COMPLEX', 'LOOK', 'INTO', 'THE', 'HUMAN', 'MIND',

9984,A14Q6R4481YFFG,0767809688,Hinkle Goldfarb,"[12, 13]","This film contains as thoughtful a treatment as the medium allows of many key military issues, including: how does a chain of command work; how should subordinates respond to questionable orders by superiors; what is loyalty and to whom should it be given, and why.  And like any great movie, it requires the viewer to think, to be drawn in, and to re-evaluate something the viewer had before taken for granted.This film has special meaning for me because of an incident in my own Navy career.  I viewed the film, along with my shipmates, at OCS.  However, I didn't fully comprehend its messages until years later and after I had been through an experience onboard that bore some resemblance to the central dilemma posed by the movie.  I was ordered by a superior officer to perform an act against regulations by underpaying people going TAD.  Those of you who were onboard FFG-12 in 1989 know the superior officer I'm talking about -- the one who was a TAR.  Anyhow, I had the facts on my side (see JFTR U4177) and I stood my ground but I did not have the sophistication at the time to understand that my duty encompassed more than just blindly saying ""I'm right.""  I had a further duty to try to ameliorate the situation and provide alternatives.  Maybe that was too much to ask from a 24-year old Ensign, but like Caine's  Lt. Maryk, I could have been more aggressive in doing the right thing while not disobeying an order.I do have to mention one major problem about this movie.  Although it is quite realistic of many aspects of the Navy and shipboard life, there is one glaring falsity.  At the end of the movie, Ensign Keith is promoted the Ltjg. and is shown on another ship as an OOD.  That's nutty.  Every one of the mutinous officers would never go to sea again, and their careers would effectively be over.  What captain in the world would want as a subordinate an officer that had been tried for mutiny, even if he'd been acquitted?  What military superstructure would permit such a person to billet on a ship?

Humphrey Bogart stars as the captain of the Caine who has been relieved from duty by his officers who believe him to be insane.  This is one of Bogart's best later performances, twitching with paranoia, yet somehow oddly sympathetic.  Van Johnson is excellent as the officer who takes over and ends up charged with mutiny.  Fred MacMurray is also terrific as the officer/novelist with the self-professed yellow streak.  Robert Francis is adequate as the new officer who finds himself tangled in the mess.  And Jose Ferrer is amazing as the lawyer who defends Johnson.  He delivers a show stopping final scene.  The scenes demonstrating Bogart's paranoia are well done and memorable, and the courtroom scenes are full of tension.  What I liked most about the film is that when all was said and done, I had to really consider if Bogart was as bad as he seemed.

Humphrey Bogart is the greatest actor in the history of the motion picture. Period. Now that I got that out of my system, let us review.The Caine is an old tub that's only purpose is to tow targets for the battleships. The crew is a motley crew of undisciplined scallywags and pirates. Check out Lee Marvin! He's a dude.Fred McMurray, yes the Fred McMurray, the original absent minded professor is here as an author with the Navy as a hindrence to his writing career. And of course we have our young Lt.

Sailors walking around with their shirt tails out indeed.But it wasn't the storm that caused the mutiny, nor was it the diary kept by No. 2. No, no, no. The real reason for all the commotion and trouble had to do with one thing and one thing only...Strawberries.I have studied this picture many times and I belive Captain Queeg was correct. There WAS a key. A secret key made by a ruthlessly clever sailor who was a chow hound and wanted the strawberries for himself. The Navy has always stood for discipline, order, and a force in readiness. To have missing strawberries on board is a capital offense and the the guilty should have been keel hauled.Bogart's character carefully and intelligently played out the crime as sand was emptied from the tin. Spoonful after spoonful was emptied and still more sand remained, representing the missing strawberries. Messmen ate them? Yeah you go ahead and believe that. That cowardly traitor left the ship and didn't have the guts to say anything. There was a thief and Bogart was hot on his trail until this silly court martial got in his way.As for 'Old Yellow Stain', well his men should have been paying better attention. Bogie knew what he was doing. The Marines were OK. Cut the target line? It was the crew's fault!

Every face, every object, every thing was literally swimming with digital noise.  And the sound is as bad or worse.  No effort was made to re-master the soundtrack to even rudimentary surround sound making this the first movie I've seen in years to be presented in basic stereo.

Not just Humphrey Bogart, but all of the main actors do a great job. Jose Ferrer is excellent as Barney Greenwald.  Van Johnson, Fred MacMurray, Robert Francis bring the instigators and &#34;mutineers&#34; to life quite well. The problem for me is that I recently reread the original book by Herman Wouk.  What I thought was a great movie really turns out to be an average movie with a poor script saved by good acting.  The scene in the movie where Lieutenants. Maryck, Keefer and Keith go to visit ADMIRAL NIMITZ, is simply ludicrous.  Moreover, Wouk does a far better job of defining Queeg's murky character and truly building up the question of whether or not the &#34;mutiny&#34; was justifiable.  It is true that Herman Wouk never wrote a story in less than 500000 words...  His stories are agonizingly detailed and in some cases very unnecessarily.  Still, I'd like to see a remake of this movie without the filter of post-WWII American ideals and censors slathered on top of a weak script.  Ed Norton as Queeg?  Ralph Fiennes perhaps?

Jose Ferrer, playing the Jewish attorney who tries to save Van Johnson from death by hanging, makes an unexpected turnaround at the end of the movie during a lavish celebratory party scene (filmed at San Francisco's legendary Palace Hotel).  Ferrer's drunken outburst is pure theater, but in terms of cinema syntax comes way out of left field.  Gee, if he felt so badly about defending Maryk, why take the case at all?  It seems like it was survivor's guilt, that he wanted to make money so, knowing there was no big bucks to be made in the service, chose a career somewhere else, and left the schlubs like Queeg to do the real grunt work, and now we're persecuting him for being lower class.If that's the case, then Bogart was exactly the wrong actor to play the part.  He's good, up to a point, but he's stretching and it shows in every frame.  Needless to say, there were a dozen stars in Hollywood who could have played Queeg much better than Bogart, and his ""stunt casting"" was just another Stanley Kramer ploy to get his picture talked about.  ""Playing against type"" was what Stanley Kramer's movies were all about: Monty Clift in JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG, Judy Garland in A CHILD IS WAITING, Spencer Tracy in MAD, MAD, WORLD, Sinatra in NOT AS A STRANGER, Gene Kelly in INHERIT THE WIND, Fred Astaire in ON THE BEACH, and so on and so forth.  Watching Bogie rattle those two little steel balls in his palm while sweat explodes across his face--it's special effects you're seeing, not acting.Fred MacMurray and Van Johnson, two underrated actors, put in good work here.  Van Johnson has some really weird scars applied to his face that look like you could peel away his skin piece by piece like the Satanists in Michele Soavi's LA SETTA.  He looks like he's leaking, a subtle touch by director Edward Dymtryk, who, after testifying in front of HUAAC in April 1951, and naming 26 of his friends as Communists, must have seemed just the guy to bring to the screen the story of one man's betrayal and a government prosecution engineering to keep the status quo perky and fresh.  He does a fine job except when the young officer, Willie (played by Robert Francis) has scenes on the phone or in person with his young love interest, May Winn (played by herself).  They make the movie unutterably fake.  Wonder why?  Just the one scene of May Winn kneeling on her bed in a white stain negligee, on the phone to Willie, saying, ""Darling, darling, darling"": why is one scene, one image enough to completely dispel all illusion?

It's not as simple as that, however.  The characters are the key to the story, each one developing in front of our eyes into complex individuals with moral dilemmas to confront.  There is Humphrey Bogart, cast a Captain Queeg whose decisions are no longer respected by his men.  There's Fred MacMurray, cast as a smart and manipulative lieutenant.  There's Van Johnson, cast as the lieutenant on whose shoulders the responsibility falls.  There's Robert Francis, the young ensign whose perceptions change in front of our eyes.  And then there is Jose Ferrer, cast as the attorney who defends Van Johnson when he is put on trial for mutiny.  Put them all together in a fast paced script with enough twists and turns, and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.The special effects, of course, are nothing like they are today.  But they were certainly enough.  I wasn't thinking about the special effects as I watched the film.  I just simply felt I was on that ship. I wasn't thinking about the actors' performances either.  Instead, I was so totally involved with the story that I felt I was actually in the skin of each of the characters. Just like real life, the situations were never crystal clear and each choice that was made opened up new challenges.These were challenging roles for all the actors and they rose to the occasion magnificently.  I'll never forget the twitch in Humphrey Bogart's cheek or the way the lighting captured the white of his eyeballs.  I'll long remember Fred MacMurray's speculations and the kind of choice Van Johnson had to make.  Robert Francis was good, but not as great as his co-stars, and his role was hampered by a silly romance. This was a strong film, though, and this small diversion didn't matter at all.Even though this film was about the military, I can't classify it as a war film.  Here, there was no enemy but the men themselves and the choices they made.

10006,A34R082C89TAO9,0767809688,L. Mitnick,"[6, 6]","I first saw this film as a very young kid, and, of course, what does a ten year old kid know?  I do remember it being talked about, and I also remember a lot of people talking about the book, which I finally got around to reading when I was in college.  I found the book to be a vaulting and incredible literary experience.  This film, while certainly not as detailed as the book, comes pretty close in replicating the effect of the Herman Wouk best-seller.  Is Queeg mentally and emotionally unstable?  Or has he been ""railroaded""?  Well, actually it's both.  Captain Queeg is definitely several tacos short of a combination plate, and my feeling is that he was ill-equiped to be in command of his ship -- especially at a point of crisis.  But were Maryk's actions totally warranted?  And of course, he was manipulated and pushed by Keefer, who possesses the ability to ignite a situation -------- and walk away from it smelling like baby's breath.  The story is by now well known, and there have been several adaptions of this book, including ""The Caine Mutiny Court Marshall"", which, while good as far as it goes, fails to illustrate the chain of events which led to the trial in the first place.  This film, however, does it all, and the actual trial in the final forty minutes or so of the picture is the climax.  Van Johnson is quite good as Steve Maryk, far better than in any other film I've ever seen him in.  He's clearly in the throes of a dilemma, and he is a man who can be influenced.  Fred MacMurry is also good in what is probably the best role he ever played in films.  He's laid-back, scholarly, and of course, very dangerous.  Robert Francis, who regretably had a very short film career (he was killed in, I believe, a plane crash not long after this film was completed)is a very boyish, naive Keefe. His performance is vapid, and not very good, but surrounded by the actors of this calibre, and being so inexperienced, it's amazing that he was as plausible as he is.  Finally, it's the Captain Queeg of Humphrey Bogart and the Bernie Greenwald of Jose Ferrer who dominate the film, even though Ferrer doesn't make his appearance until the final part of the film.  Bogart was nominated for an Oscar for his role (and were it not for Marlon Brando in ""On the Waterfront"", he probably would have won). He's craggy, definitely mentally unstable, and finally, a very sad and tragic figure.  Bernie Greenwald, in the persona of Jose Ferrer, has the unpleasant task of defending a man for whom he has little personal regard.  He comes to understand the real story, and he get's his shame and disgust off his chest at the very end of the film.  Students of American history should see this film, as well as those who respected and admired the talents of Humphrey Bogart and Jose Ferrer (both were highly skilled actors).

So my review focuses on the actors and their amazing achievement in this standout production.There are few performers who can claim such an amazing range. In fact, I can't think of any modern actor whose legacy includes saintly good to unapologetically evil. Anthony Hopkins comes close, but even his Oscar-winning 'evil' performance was laced with stylish aplomb. I remember when the crowd cheered at the end of 'SOTL' - they cheered for the serial killer. Hardly the epitome of despicable badness. Ditto Daniel Day Lewis, whose sheer character complexity defies simple classifications as 'good' or 'evil'.For me, Fred MacMurray will always be that consummate actor, perfectly attuned to his character's singular dimension.I've never seen someone who could so completely possess the attributes of a complete shyte, uncompromisingly dirty and totally rotten. Then accept another role - do a complete 180 - and be the most sweet, affectionate, and wonderfully tender guy.I often wonder what he must've been like in real life. Actually, as I think about it, kinda scary comes to mind.There's so much to MacMurray's career that it's difficult to express in a few choice words, much less a quickie movie review. Suffice to say that in this role - he plays a conniving heel.This was a truly revelatory moment in my life. I had grown up with the ""latter"" MacMurray - the absent-minded professor, the funny scout leader, the ultimate kind and understanding father. Seriously, I had no clue who he could be, until I saw this film when I was in my late teens. Have to admit, I was heartbroken to watch him as the shallow and cowardly manipulator. It was almost too much to bear.It took *years* before I came to terms with The Actor - and not the loss of my idealized heroic father figure.Simultaneously, one of the greatest roles that Bogie undertook in his storied career. The tough as nails gumshoe, the clever quick-witted entrepreneur, the sly iconoclast transporter - cast as a mentally unstable and deeply flawed autocrat. An insecure and bitter naval officer who battles ghosts of his past and chases dreams of his youth, the now infamous palm-full-of-ball-bearings Captain Queeg. The role that should've easily merited another Oscar.That must've been so difficult - the 1955 show was loaded with, what later became, iconic films. And in this instance, I can't really find fault with the Academy for choosing the eventual winner, Marlon Brando in 'Waterfront'.Still, it's a genuine standout performance and one that easily bookends Bogie's more well-known works.And like MacMurray and Bogart's superlative performances - this is likely Van Johnson's finest effort. In my opinion, he was never an actor of range or skill. Not that he wasn't good at his job, but there just wasn't a lot under the hood. What he did, he did well. But in 'Mutiny' he found the performance of a lifetime and I'm appreciative of it.Lastly, it would be criminal not to comment on one of my all-time favorite character actors - J&ograve;se Ferrer. That deep baritone that honestly sounded like the voice from heaven. Loved him as the 'detective' who finally unravels the true face of shame and dishonor.A masterpiece production that has, and will continue, to enthrall generations of cinephiles to come.",5,A Masterpiece - Period,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,3398,"['*Spoiler', 'Warning*My', 'presumption', ""'ve"", 'already', 'read', 'reviews', 'discuss', 'facts', 'plot', 'review', 'actors', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'standout', 'production.There', 'are', 'few', 'performers', 'who', 'can', 'claim', 'such', 'amazing', 'range', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'modern', 'actor', 'legacy', 'saintly', 'good', 'unapologetically', 'evil', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'close', 'even', 'Oscar-winning', ""'evil"", 'performance', 'was', 'laced', 'stylish', 'aplomb', 'remember', 'when', 'crowd', 'cheered', 'end', ""'SOTL"", 'cheered', 'serial', 'killer', 'Hardly', 'epitome', 'despicable', 'badness', 'Ditto', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'sheer', 'character', 'complexity', 'simple', 'classifications', ""'good"", ""'evil'.For"", 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'consummate', 'actor', 'perfectly', 'attuned', 'character', 'singular', 'dimension.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'so', 'completely', 'attributes', 'complete', 'shyte', 'uncompromisingly', 'dirty', 'totally', 'rotten', 'Then', 'role', 'do', 'complete', '180', 'be', 'most', 'sweet', 'affectionate', 'wonderfully', 'tender', 'guy.I', 'often', 'what', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'real', 'life', 'Actually', 'think', 'scary', 'mind.There', 'so', 'much', 'MacMurray', 'career', 'difficult', 'express', 'few', 'choice', 'words', 'much', 'less', 'quickie', 'movie', 'review', 'Suffice', 'say', 'role', 'conniving', 'heel.This', 'was', 'truly', 'revelatory', 'moment', 'life', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'latter', 'MacMurray', 'absent-minded', 'professor', 'funny', 'scout', 'leader', 'ultimate', 'kind', 'understanding', 'father', 'Seriously', 'had', 'clue', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'late', 'teens', 'Have', 'admit', 'was', 'heartbroken', 'watch', 'shallow', 'cowardly', 'manipulator', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'bear.It', 'took', '*years*', 'came', 'terms', 'Actor', 'not', 'loss', 'idealized', 'heroic', 'father', 'figure.Simultaneously', 'one', 'greatest', 'roles', 'Bogie', 'undertook', 'storied', 'career', 'tough', 'nails', 'gumshoe', 'clever', 'quick-witted', 'entrepreneur', 'sly', 'iconoclast', 'transporter', 'cast', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'autocrat', 'insecure', 'bitter', 'naval', 'officer', 'who', 'ghosts', 'past', 'chases', 'dreams', 'youth', 'now', 'infamous', 'palm-full-of-ball-bearings', 'Captain', 'Queeg', 'role', 'should', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'merited', 'Oscar.That', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'difficult', '1955', 'show', 'was', 'loaded', 'what', 'later', 'became', 'iconic', 'films', 'instance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'fault', 'Academy', 'choosing', 'eventual', 'winner', 'Marlon', 'Brando', ""'Waterfront'.Still"", 'genuine', 'standout', 'performance', 'one', 'easily', 'Bogie', 'more', 'well-known', 'works.And', 'MacMurray', 'Bogart', 'superlative', 'performances', 'likely', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'finest', 'effort', 'opinion', 'was', 'never', 'actor', 'range', 'skill', 'Not', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'job', 'there', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'hood', 'What', 'did', 'did', 'well', ""'Mutiny"", 'found', 'performance', 'lifetime', ""'m"", 'appreciative', 'it.Lastly', 'would', 'be', 'criminal', 'not', 'comment', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'character', 'actors', 'J', 'ograve', 'se', 'Ferrer', 'deep', 'baritone', 'honestly', 'sounded', 'voice', 'heaven', 'Loved', ""'detective"", 'who', 'finally', 'true', 'face', 'shame', 'dishonor.A', 'masterpiece', 'production', 'will', 'continue', 'enthrall', 'generations', 'cinephiles', 'come']",N/A
10008,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0767809688,magellan,"[2, 3]","Please note that I saw this movie on HBO so I can't comment on the video transfer.This is a truly great classic that is just top notch in every respect. Besides the all-star cast, everyone did a wonderful job with their roles. Bogart plays against type here as a man who no longer can cope with the stresses of command, in contrast to many of his other roles as an intrepid, smart, more than competent tough guy.Based on the Herman Wouk novel (who wrote many best-sellers in the 50s and 60s, such as The Winds of War), the story chronicles the downward spiral of a destroyer/mine sweeper captain who is now cracking under the strain. What's great is how the other roles and characters in the movie contrast and complement each other: MacMurray as the insightful but cowardly writer who convinces everyone Bogart is paranoid but cops out later, van Johnson as the plodding but dutiful and courageous chief officer, and Robert Francis as the young and inexperienced but idealistic ensign. And Jose Ferrer is great as the Naval lawyer who defends the mutineers at the end.Just a little trivia, the shots in Yosemite, using on site locations, were unusual for Hollywood at the time, and the scenes at the hotel appear to have been done at the famous Aiwanee hotel there (having visited it once myself) There's even footage of the famous pouring of the embers over Fire Falls in the film, which, by the time I visited Yosemite for the first time in the late 60s, had already been banned because the hot embers had started a couple of fires.Robert Francis unfortunately had a promising career cut short when he was killed at the age of 25 in a private plane crash only 11 months after this movie was filmed. He had only appeared in four films, with the Caine Mutiny being the second.Another interesting feature of the movie is that the three main ships the movie was filmed on actually saw service during WWII, the movie being just 10 years after WWII ended. There are three future stars in the film: a cameo appearance by a very young looking Lee Marvin during the trial scene; at one point it looks like Claude Akins (from the move The Dirty Dozen and also he starred in that TV series about Truckers back in the 70s) sticks his head through a door at one point; and Jerry Paris, who would later play on the Dick van Dyke show, also appears as the junior ensign.Finally, another reviewer commented:&lt;&lt;Queeg's final crack up on the witness stand at Lt. Maryk's court martial is justifiably famous, and is among the great scenes in cinema. It is now impossible for any character in any film to play with a pair of steel balls and not think of Bogart.>>LOL.

I was also a young ensign, and Robert Francis, as ENS Willie Keith, also nails his role. I had to laugh at the opening scene in which the admiral refers to the new officers as &#34;full-fledged ensigns&#34;. Having been a brand new ensign, I can assure you there's nothing full-fledged about it, and most of the extras portraying young officers in that scene are too old. He is so cool, my seeing this movie when it first came out may well have been a deciding factor in my decision to select the Navy as my branch of service.The story arc with Willie's mother and girlfriend is mostly distracting, but it does point up his silver spoon upbringing and efforts to grow up in spite of it.Special kudos go to the US Navy technical advisor, CDR James Shaw, and the cooperation of the US Navy. Unlike, say, &#34;Top Gun&#34;, which was a terrible turkey, this movie crackles with realism, and the dialogue, action, sets and scenes, and details are near-perfect.Special mention goes to the effects used in the typhoon scene. Obviously shot with a model, it is nonetheless incredibly real. I can assure you of this, as I was in a similar storm in the North Atlantic in a ship of the class seen at the very end of this movie. The typhoon had to be convincing to make Captain Queeg's breakdown believable, and it is.The moment Jose Ferrer walks into his first scene, the movie belongs to him. He's an incredibly sharp, smartass Naval Aviator who doesn't even want to take the case, and, for good measure, the bandaged hand symbolically suggests that he's going to have to defend an unwinable position with one hand tied behind his back.The court martial is perfectly depicted, showing how carefully the Navy proceeds in such matters.The after party scene is also perfect.

So does Van Johnson as the decent executive officer who takes over the controls when Queeg snaps. As many have pointed out, the only true weakness of the film is the attention given to a budding romance between Robert Francis and May Wynn which does nothing to advance the plot. The complex drama ends with a stunning courtroom scene in which Jose Ferrer gets a chance to do some heavy emoting.Max Steiner's score includes a jaunty, catchy main theme but is otherwise not one of his most interesting scores.

Queeg tries to run a taught ship. No one takes him seriously except the XO LT. Maryk.Queeg's already weak grip on reality begins to loosen, and is exploited by a reserve officer who convinces the other officers that Queeg has lost the ability to command. When Captain Queeg devotes his billet to solving the mystery of the missing pint of strawberries, all begin to question his sanity. Then during a period of heavy weather, Queeg freezes and is unable to give proper orders. LT. Maryk, having been polluted by the slanders of the reserve officer (who in civilian life is a successful writer), prematurally relieves the Captain, and takes &quot;full command&quot;. The court martial scene that follows reveals the ugly selfishness in everybody involved. The film could've ended there, and been regaled as a masterpiece. But the coda that follows is even better. From the beginning, defense attorney LT. Barney Greenwald, a line officer-cum-lawyer assigned to JAG, perceived exactly what had transpired, and why. During an odd celebration, LT. Greenwald explains it all. At once compelling, then sad, then obvious, a lesson in life is offered to the viewer. A brief additional coda sees the film go full circle as a naive Ensign gets a chance to start over again. As great as this story is, it is perhaps the outstanding performances of the players that make The Caine Mutiny an all-time classic. The star-studded cast delivers every line as if it were their own. One might come to believe that Humphrey Bogart and Captain Queeg are one in the same. Jose Fareer's portrayal of JAG Greenwald is spellbinding.

Queeg leads the USS Caine in World War Two in the Pacific. Unfortunately, Queeg is a neurotic and incompetent man who frequently makes mistakes while harrassing his crew over the smallest things. When the crew decides to relieve him of his command during a fierce storm, they are charged with mutiny. If convicted, they will be hanged.The Caine Mutiny is a very well made film. The characters are interesting and the morality of mutiny and duty is thought provoking. However, I found the film's politics to be very rightest. The message of the film seems to be that it is better for a ship and her crew to be destroyed rather than rebel against an incompetent captain. The crew relieve Queeg quite gently with the first officer saying he is sorry to have to do this. In response, the crew is arrested and sentenced to hang. Were the rules really this strict in World War Two? Apparently, otherwise this film probably couldn't have been made. Nevertheless, it makes me glad I wasn't around during that time.Another problem I had with the film is the twist ending. Although very well done and in the context of the film, I didn't like its message.

10027,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,0767809688,Randy Keehn,"[3, 3]","I was a real Bogart fan way back when I was a teenager.  Unfortunately, the late show was about the only place you could hope to see old movies.  I watched'em when I could but I also read the books some of Bogart's movies were based on as a sort of preparation.  I read ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""To Have and Have Not"", ""The Aftican Queen"" and I had gotten a copy of ""The Desperate Hours"" but was able to see the movie before I got a chance to read the book.  I also read ""The Caine Mutiny"" which was a pretty good book in its' own right.  In fact, it was such a good book that I had my doubts that, even with Bogart in it, the movie could live up to the book.  I found it interesting that Bogart got the role of Captain Queeg; a very challenging assignment.I was very impressed once I finally got the chance to see the movie.  I was impressed with virtually all the facets of the production; the directing, the acting, the screenplay (great adaptation from the book), good color, good sets, etc.  I was  negatively impressed with the toy ship that was used in the typhoon but I was appalled at the casting of Robert Francis in the role of Ensign Willie Keith.  Keith is the focal point in the book and is, to a certain extent, the focal point in the movie (are we aware of anyone else's girl friend, for example?).  However, his acting is so bad that we tend to view him as a sort of dramatic fall guy for the real actors on the set.  The quartet of Bogart, Jose Ferrer, Van Johnson, and Fred MacMurray elevate this film to greatness.  Bogart does so in his characterization of a naval captain whose difficulty in handling stress confounds his junior officers.  It is a masterful preformance (but doesn't quite equal that year's Oscar-winning preformance of Marlin Brando in ""On the Waterfront"").  Jose Ferrer is masterful as a naval lawyer who has no time for amateur psychiatrists in a time of war.  He does have empathy when he discerns that the wrong man is on trial.  Van Johnson goes beyond his usual level of preformance to display an inability to comprehend some things yet an ability to realize the truly important ones.  Fred MacMurray got the unenviable job of playing Lt. Tom Keefer; a man who is all talk and who sticks his neck out for no one.  After drumming up all the talk about Queeg's derangement, Lt. Keefer leaves his fellow officers holding the bag.

10028,A1VSIAXJ11B2KS,0767809688,R. F. Mojica,"[3, 11]","I've always liked this film, but it is not a great movie. I find it to be typical of its producer, Stanley Kramer. Kramer is, I think, the most over-rated name in film history. He made good films, that looked expensive and well put together, but, to me anyway, there was always something ""not there"". I think what was missing was real imagination. As you watch his films, you just nod your head and think (maybe subconsciously) ""that's the way I expected it would be done"". There are always tons of cliches, visually, in the dialogue and in the plot. If I, as just an average film watcher, can sit through a whole movie and say ""that's just the way I woulda done it"", maybe it's not that well done. We should expect higher levels of originality and imagination from an ""auteur"" with such a grand reputation.The Caine Mutiny is a perfect example. It's like a Cliff Notes edition of the book. There's nothing really objectionable about it, but nothing exceptional either--except Humphrey Bogart.Bogart gives a great performance--I think the best of his career--and he carries the whole film. The rest of the actors are OK, maybe with the exception of the ""young lovers"", Willie and May--but I wouldn't even put that entirely on the actors because their parts are so poorly written. The girl, May Winn, in  particular, comes across as the silliest, whiniest character in the history of cinema not played by Jackie Searl. When I was younger, I was appalled by how bad the ""romance"" scenes were, and would always fast forward them. Now I get a laugh when I watch them, so I don't skip. Besides--that's the way they were in the book!Jose Ferrer, as the defense attorney, got the chance to be very hammy; most of the rest of the cast was better than adequate, and we 3 Stooges fans even got to see favorite villain Kenneth MacDonald playing a serious part (with no spoken lines--I guess he was picked because he looked very military in uniform) as a member of the court martial. Even the famous Max Steiner contributed to the ""atmosphere of cliche"" with his musical score, which sounded like the musical score of every navy picture ever made.But Bogart saves the picture. He has a lot of great lines in the picture (or he makes them sound great), my favorite being ""we oughta have some fun around here now that there's some detective work to be done"".  I also love the scene when he is greatly offended when he is not invited to watch the Hopalong Cassidy film being enjoyed by the rest of the crew. Without Bogart, with another actor in his part, this film would have been a semi-bomb.It's an enjoyable and entertaining film, but it's no classic and certainly not a great film. It could have been, maybe, with more imaginative hands running the show.",4,"Entertaining, But Not A Great Movie",1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2744,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'find', 'be', 'typical', 'producer', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'Kramer', 'think', 'most', 'over-rated', 'name', 'film', 'history', 'made', 'good', 'films', 'looked', 'expensive', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'anyway', 'was', 'always', 'something', 'not', 'there', 'think', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'real', 'imagination', 'watch', 'films', 'just', 'nod', 'head', 'think', 'maybe', 'subconsciously', 'way', 'expected', 'would', 'be', 'done', 'are', 'always', 'tons', 'cliches', 'visually', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'as', 'just', 'average', 'film', 'watcher', 'can', 'sit', 'whole', 'movie', 'say', 'just', 'way', 'woulda', 'done', 'maybe', 'not', 'that', 'well', 'done', 'should', 'expect', 'higher', 'levels', 'originality', 'imagination', 'auteur', 'grand', 'reputation.The', 'Caine', 'Mutiny', 'perfect', 'example', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'edition', 'book', 'nothing', 'really', 'objectionable', 'nothing', 'exceptional', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart.Bogart', 'great', 'performance', 'think', 'best', 'career', 'whole', 'film', 'rest', 'actors', 'are', 'OK', 'maybe', 'exception', 'young', 'lovers', 'Willie', 'May', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'put', 'entirely', 'actors', 'parts', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'written', 'girl', 'May', 'Winn', 'particular', 'silliest', 'whiniest', 'character', 'history', 'cinema', 'not', 'played', 'Jackie', 'Searl', 'When', 'was', 'younger', 'was', 'appalled', 'how', 'bad', 'romance', 'scenes', 'were', 'would', 'always', 'fast', 'forward', 'Now', 'get', 'laugh', 'when', 'watch', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'skip', 'Besides', 'way', 'were', 'book', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'defense', 'attorney', 'got', 'chance', 'be', 'very', 'hammy', 'most', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'better', 'adequate', '3', 'Stooges', 'fans', 'even', 'got', 'see', 'favorite', 'villain', 'Kenneth', 'MacDonald', 'playing', 'serious', 'part', 'spoken', 'lines', 'guess', 'was', 'picked', 'looked', 'very', 'military', 'uniform', 'member', 'court', 'martial', 'Even', 'famous', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'contributed', 'atmosphere', 'cliche', 'musical', 'score', 'sounded', 'musical', 'score', 'navy', 'picture', 'ever', 'made.But', 'Bogart', 'picture', 'lot', 'great', 'lines', 'picture', 'sound', 'great', 'favorite', 'being', 'oughta', 'have', 'fun', 'here', 'now', 'detective', 'work', 'be', 'done', 'also', 'love', 'scene', 'when', 'greatly', 'offended', 'when', 'not', 'invited', 'watch', 'Hopalong', 'Cassidy', 'film', 'being', 'enjoyed', 'rest', 'crew', 'Bogart', 'actor', 'part', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'semi-bomb.It', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'film', 'classic', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'maybe', 'more', 'imaginative', 'hands', 'running', 'show']",N/A

Like all great movies from this era,  we are treated to a strong cast of personalities and how they react during  a great story line. Bogart is the hard-line captain who hides behind a  tough exterior as a way of distancing anybody who tries to get close to  him. But this is just what he needs after the hell he's been through  fighting in the Atlantic campaign. He's does make a few attempts to buddy  up in the movie, but the men reject him each time due to his growing  strictness and deteriorating mental condition. A real study of the human  psyche which Bogart plays like a master. A nice sideline story in this  movie is the new gung-ho ensign Robert Francis. Watching him slowly mature  from a dominating mother, appreciate his vivacious girlfriend, all while  becoming a competant naval officer.

10034,A16QODENBJVUI1,0767809688,Robert Moore,"[82, 82]","THE CAINE MUTINY remains one of the finest films ever made about the Navy.  It was also one the U.S. Navy had a complex relationship with.  On the one hand, the navy provided considerable access to naval vessels.  Significant scenes were shot on at least three:  the destroyer-mine sweeper used to represent the Caine, a light cruiser at the very end, and the U.S.S. Kearsarge, which represented Halsey's flag ship the U.S.S. Enterprise, though he later moved to the U.S.S. Missouri.  Despite this remarkable cooperation, the Navy very nearly withheld its approval for the film.  It was afraid that the public might imagine that the story represented actual events or that it might be imagined that there had been a mutiny aboard some ship.  Only after the filmmakers agree to begin the film with a historical disclaimer did they approve.More than anything, despite the presence of ships, the film is mainly a showcase for great acting.  The quality of the cast simply can't be exaggerated.  There are a host of stellar performances, and they even have such future stars as Lee Marvin in throwaway parts.  Humphrey Bogart absolutely dominates the screen with one of the finest performances of his career.  Most of the fan and critic polls I have seen over the years of the greatest movie stars of all time invariably place Bogart in the number one spot, and when you see him in this role, and then realize that he has 7 or 8 roles just as great, it is easy to see why.  He is such a forceful presence that one would imagine that he wouldn't have been capable of a variety of roles, yet you contrast this film with THE MALTESE FALCON and THE AFRICAN QUEEN, and you realize that he had a capacity to play a surprisingly wide range of roles.  Lt. Commander Queeg lacks almost all of the qualities of Rick in CASABLANCA, and possesses a host of lamentable ones as well.  The scene in which Queeg cowardly has the U.S.S. Caine quickly outrun the landing crafts it is assigned to protect and then retreat to safety as fast as possible is made all the worse by the courage his characters in other films display.  Queeg's final crack up on the witness stand at Lt. Maryk's court martial is justifiably famous, and is among the great scenes in cinema.  It is now impossible for any character in any film to play with a pair of steel balls and not think of Bogart.The rest of the cast is hardly shamed by Bogart.  Van Johnson, as the loyal, enormously capable, conscientious Lt. Maryk is superb.  (This is, by the way, the only film in which the make up department didn't cover the quite large scars on his forehead that he suffered over a decade earlier in a serious car wreck, which resulted in a steel plate being placed in his forehead.)  Robert Francis, who had a promising career cut short at the age of 25 in a plane crash he suffered a year after this film, is solid as the young, idealistic Ensign Keith (though the parallels between his hesitancy to stand up to his mother and marry the woman he loves and his hesitancy to stand up to his commanders isn't developed as much as it is implied) holds his own against stiff competition.  Fred MacMurray, who spent his entire career bouncing between utterly lovable and absolutely reprehensible characters, here takes the latter course as the complex, spineless Lt. Keefer.  His character adds a delicious degree of ambiguity to the film.  Jerry Paris, who would later play Rob and Laura Petrie's friend in THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW, is excellent as the ship's other junior ensign.  Tom Tully managed an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor in his stellar performance as Lt. Commander DeVriess, the first commander of the Caine.  Jose Ferrer (who is, by the way, George Clooney's uncle by marriage), whose screen roles never seemed to come up to the level of his talent, is outstanding in his small but memorable role as the mutineers' defense attorney.On a minor note, I very much enjoyed the very unusual location scene in Yosemite National Park.  Although we take location shots for granted today, Hollywood in the thirties, forties, and fifties was only very slowly willing to undertake location shots.  It is hard today to realize how radical it was for directors like John Huston (who shot parts of THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE in Mexico and THE AFRICAN QUEEN in Africa) or John Ford (who shot extensively in Arizona for his Westerns and in Ireland for THE QUIET MAN) to shoot on location.  The general preference was to build sets on Hollywood backlots.  It is so unusual to see location shots that no sound film was shot on location in Chicago (many films were made at the old Essanay Studios in Chicago in the teens and twenties) until the superb Jimmy Stewart CALL NORTHSIDE 777.  The scenes in this one, therefore, set in Yosemite are pretty unique.",5,Film acting simply doesn't get better than this,1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,4808,"['CAINE', 'MUTINY', 'one', 'finest',

10035,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,0767809688,Roger J. Buffington,"[3, 3]","I hadn't watched this film for many years, but recently bought and watched the DVD version.  This movie is just as great now as it was when it came out in 1954.This film packs a tremendous amount into about 125 minutes--a crisis of leadership, the testing of loyalty, and courtroom drama--all done superlatively well.  This is the tale of ordinary men who are tested in wartime by the fact that they are serving a captain who is a spectacularly bad leader.  As almost everyone knows, this is the story of the events surrounding what amounts to a kind of mutiny aboard a US Navy destroyer during World War 2 in the Pacific.  The events leading up to this, and the aftermath, are a great story that ranks with &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; as a naval classic. The story moves at a fast pace, never drags, features excellent acting, and the script is a wonderful adaptation of Herman Wouk's novel of the same name.The movie merited seven Academy Award nominations, and the book a Pulitzer Prize, all for a very good and simple reason: this is a great story about ordinary men who are placed in a difficult and all-too-possible situation.

Humphrey Bogart may not have won his Oscar for this film (he did for African Queen), but this is perhaps his best and certainly most remembered role as the shell-shocked burned-out Captain of a busted-down ill-disciplined minesweeping vessel at the height of the war and a hurricane.  Watching Bogart's Captain Queeg slow breakdown and his begging to his officers for help at one point is heart-wrenching.  This is a surprisingly touching and emotional film.The entire supporting cast is brilliant as well including Van Johnson who was never one of my favorite actors from this era, but performs here flawlessly as the second in command who eventually releaves his Captain by force.  In addition, there are fine performances by Fred McMurray as the comic relief but also the sinister and arrogant instigator on the ship whose devious and self-centered motives push the story to it's inevitable and tragic conclusion, and Jose Ferrar is wonderful as the defense attorney for Van Johnson's character and he plays his role with bitingly sarcastic wit while he eventually learns to believe in his client in spite of his reservation.  Ferrar's character even states that he would rather prosecute these ""mutineers"" than defend them as they had abandon Queeg when he needed help the most.  Even E.G. Marshall's bit part as the prosecutor shows depth of character in the subtly ways in which he views Queeg on the stand during his breakdown.The trial sequence near the end of the film is riveting and spawned it's own play later on Broadway.  Watching Bogart's Queeg go from authoritative, confident, even arrogant, Captain to an emotional mess on the stand is awesome.

Szmutko,"[3, 4]","""Aboard my ship, excellent performance is standard, standard performance is sub-standard, and sub-standard performance is not permitted to exist - that, I warn you.""Based on the novel by the great Herman Wouk, THE CAINE MUTINY boasts one of the best performances and ensemble cast of any movie from the 1950s.  Ensign Willie Keith, the nave young officer, is wonderfully played by Robert Francis, who died in a plane crash at the age of 25 one year after this role. Classic stars Humphrey Bogart, Van Johnson, Fred McMurray, Jose Ferrer, Tom Tully, and a bevy of talented and (at the time) lesser known stars (including Lee Marvin and Claude Akins), round out this wonderfully diverse group of performers.  They combine to paint a realistic portrait of life aboard the Caine - a tired, WWII ship desperately in need of leadership.The movie is essentially in three parts:  The first part focuses on the arrival and experiences of young Ensign Keith, a son of privilege and wealth with an idealized view of the world and lofty expectations of those in command.  He is discouraged by the presumed lethargy of his commander - the war weary Commander DeVriess, and yearns for a spit-and-polish type as a source of strength.In the second part, Ensign Keith get's his wish (or so he thinks) in the form of Lt. Commander Philip Francis Queeg - a formal ""by-the-book"" man who is in reality, a battered veteran of one too-many combat experiences.  Beautifully played by Humphrey Bogart, in one of his finest performances, Queeg is contrasted with the cynical communications officer (played against type by Fred McMurray), the torn, yet devoted executive officer played by Van Johnson, and young Ensign Keith.  Events escalate until the climactic mutiny, when the reluctant executive officer relieves the Captain.In the third part, the action shifts to the court martial of the offending officers.  Jose Ferrer gives a brilliant and inspired performance as naval defender Barney Greenwald.  While all main actors give splendid performances, Humphrey Bogart's witness stand testimony shows the actors remarkable abilities.  His transformation from confident and personable officer to a person of mental exhaustion displays Bogart's considerable talents.The DVD sound and picture quality are excellent with the last reel properly remastered (in comparison with the earlier VHS release).  Extras include ""Inside The Caine Mutiny,"" a two-part documentary exploring the making of the film as well as specific themes and plot elements.

10048,A17639YIJLDS1G,0767809688,still searching,"[1, 1]","The Caine Mutiny was adapted from bestselling novel of the same name published in 1951, coincidentally the same year Nicholas Monsarrat published The Cruel Sea, which was also made into a film and released a year before the &#8216;Caine&#8217;.  Both, of course, dealt with similar subject matter; life on a small naval ship in combat during World War II and the trials and considerable tribulations of the officers and crew.  And both feature very strong central performances from the actors playing the ships&#8217; captains; Humphrey Bogart, in the case of the Caine, and Jack Hawkins, in the case of Compass Rose in the Cruel Sea.But to focus on the Caine, although it is through the eyes of young Ensign Willie Keith that we witness the gradual disintegration of the ship&#8217;s captain, it is the performance of Fred McMurray playing communications officer, Lieutenant Tom Keefer, which really catches the eye in this film and is central to all the action that subsequently unfolds aboard the ill-fated USS Caine.  It is Keefer who first gives voice to the suspicions that the officers and crew are beginning to have about the increasingly bizarre behaviour of their captain and it is Keefer, who, expert in the role of agent provocateur, and ever so subtly at first, incites executive officer Lieutenant Maryck (Van Johnson) to forcibly assume the role of ship&#8217;s captain over the objections of the officially appointed skipper, Lieutenant Commander Queeg (Bogart), when the latter seems certain to sink the ship in a typhoon when he &#8216;freezes&#8217; under severe stress.The only literally discordant note in the entire production is, unfortunately, the dreadfully inappropriate triumphalist score by Max Steiner!",4,Good film &#8211; shame about the score!,1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,1731,"['Caine', 'Mutiny', 'was', 'adapted', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'published', '1951', 'coincidentally', 'same', 'year', 'Nicholas', 'Monsarrat', 'published', 'Cruel', 'Sea', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'film', 'released', 'year', '8216', 'Caine', '8217', 'course', 'dealt', 'similar', 'subject', 'matter', 'life', 'small', 'naval', 'ship', 'combat', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'trials', 'considerable', 'tribulations', 'officers', 'crew', 'feature', 'very', 'strong', 'central', 'performances', 'actors', 'playing', 'ships', '8217', 'captains', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'case', 'Caine', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'case', 'Compass', 'Rose', 'Cruel', 'Sea.But', 'focus', 'Caine', 'eyes', 'young', 'Ensign', 'Willie', 'Keith', 'witness', 'gradual', 'disintegration', 'ship', '8217', 'captain', 'performance', 'Fred', 'McMurray', 'playing', 'communications', 'officer', 'Lieutenant', 'Tom', 'Keefer', 'really', 'eye', 'film', 'central', 'action', 'subsequently', 'ill-fated', 'USS', 'Caine', 'Keefer', 'who', 'first', 'voice', 'suspicions', 'officers', 'crew', 'are', 'beginning', 'have', 'increasingly', 'bizarre', 'behaviour', 'captain', 'Keefer', 'who', 'expert', 'role', 'agent', 'provocateur', 'ever', 'so', 'subtly', 'first', 'incites', 'executive', 'officer', 'Lieutenant', 'Maryck', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'forcibly', 'assume', 'role', 'ship', '8217', 'captain', 'objections', 'officially', 'appointed', 'skipper', 'Lieutenant', 'Commander', 'Queeg', 'Bogart', 'when', 'latter', 'certain', 'sink', 'ship', 'typhoon', 'when', '8216', '8217', 'severe', 'stress.The', 'only', 'literally', 'discordant', 'note', 'entire', 'production', 'unfortunately', 'dreadfully', 'inappropriate', 'triumphalist', 'score', 'Max', 'Steiner']",N/A

I bought the DVD to see how it compared to the great book. I was not surprised. Both the book and movie are super great classics... 5 stars. The color and sound were great. No complaints.The movie was nominated for 7 Academy Awards including  Best Picture and Best Actor. During WW2 Lt. Commander Queeg assumes command of an old dirty broken down minesweeper Caine from another Lt Commander who ran a sloppy ship but demanded high proficiency from the crew. Queeg is a by the book officer who demands strict obedience. We see his battle with crew and officers as he tries to run a tight ship. He makes serious mistakes and blames the crew and officers as disloyal. In the middle of a typhoon he freezes and cracks and the XO Lt. played by Val Johnson takes command and forcefully relieves Queeg with Ensign Keith's support.The ship is saved but has damage. A Court Marshal is done and Captain Queeg breaks down and is shown as psychotic. The XO and officers get off the grounds of Mutiny. The 3rd in command a LT played by Fred Macmurray becomes a coward at the trial and lies and does not support the XO against his Captain.We see Queeg's ineptitude running over the line of a target and not collecting it and lying the line parted. Also his cowardliness of not leading Marine landing craft the full 1000 yards to the beach. Queeg and the Caine drop a yellow marker and turn. The marines were by themselves for protection as they were shelled.Here is a great movie with WW2 battle action, the Caine fighting a Typhoon, carrier action and more. Lots of super character development. A love story between Ensign Keith and his girl while Keith's rich mother tries to dominate. Humphrey Bogart as Lt. Commander Queeg was superb in his action and breakdown. No wonder he was nominated as best actor and the movie as best picture.Anyone liking a great WW2 Navy movie with superb character development and acting will love this movie. 5 stars and proudly added to our DVD library.",5,Herman Wouk Pulitzer prize winner.

10051,A2MNMZMM6BGLTA,0767809688,"Uncle Chino ""Johnny""","[3, 3]","I just watched The Caine Mutiny and what a great film. Humphrey Bogart was of course excellent as the paranoid Captain of the Caine who drives everybody nuts with his anal retentive ways and nit picking. Jose Ferrer is fantastic as the defense council who begrudgingly takes the case of the mutinous officers of the Caine. Fred McMurray, of My Three Sons television fame is great as the smart, good looking popular officer/writer who inevitably is exposed with a regretful sense of self preservation and little spine. Van Johnson does a good job as does the rest of the cast including a very good, as usual, performance by E.G. Marshal as the prosecutor of the court marshal. Also, we see Lee Marvin and Claude Akins in very early roles as sailors aboard the ship.One of the main reasons that I like this movie is that it could have been so simple but it is not. It could have been cut and dry and in some ways it almost was. Good v.s. bad, the paranoid and evil Captain v. the stoic young officers who see thru him and do what is right and are persecuted and prosecuted for it by the powers that be. But in the end with the introduction of Jose Ferrers character of the defense attorney the story takes a turn in exposing that our 'hero's' might not be as heroic or right as we or even they think. Ferrers drunken rant against the celebrating officers after the verdict not only puts the story in perspective to the viewers but also to the men he defended and his confrontation with the squeeky clean Fred McMurrays character and 'outing' of him to his brother officers is classic. If they would have chosen to just keep it black and white it still would have been a good movie.

10055,A3CFT5LHFCB46K,0767809688,"""weirdo_87""","[8, 9]","""The Caine Mutiny"" follows the story of the men aboard the minesweeper U.S.S Caine during the period of 1943-44 in the pacific war. After the Caine is assigned a new captain, Philip Queeg (Humphrey Bogart), the officers begin to get suspicious at various acts that the captain does: His attention to small details such as shirttails and erratic behavior like rolling ball bearings in his hand when he's nervous and the spouting of catchphrases like ""I kid you not"". His behavior reaches a climax during a typhoon. Executive Officer Maryk (Van Johnson), after being advised by some others, relieves the captain with the firm belief that the ship would founder with Queeg in charge. Now Maryk has to defend his actions in a court martial.It may seem surprising today, but at the time of this movie's release, Jose Ferrer was one of the hottest actors around. He was already an Oscar winner for 1950's ""Cyrano de Bergenac"". Here, he plays Lt. Barney Greenwald, who is assigned to Maryk's defense, but isn't so enthusiastic (""I've read the preliminary investigation very carefully and I think that what you've done stinks.""). He came off to me as a competent defense attorney who was just waiting for the moment to strike. And although the evidence that backs up Queeg and goes against Maryk is overwhelming, Greenwald is able to break down Queeg in court, validating his instability and allowing Maryk to get off only with a reputation as a ""mutineer"".My favorite performance is Fred MacMurray as Lieutenant Keefer, who doesn't think too highly of the Caine, even being cynical towards it (""The first thing you've got to learn about this ship is that she was designed by geniuses to be run by idiots."") And, though not a psychologist himself, he is also the one who raises it to Maryk's attention that Queeg may be nuts. Since he also contains hammering the idea at Maryk, it makes one assume that he would be willing to go all the way by alerting the top navy brass. But we soon learn that he is nothing but a scheming coward. He plants it in the men's minds that the captain is crazy, yet has ""A yellow streak 15 miles wide"". And when he is called to testify, ""He never even heard of Queeg"" as Greenwald remarks. At this point, we turn from disliking his cynicism to hating his guts. MacMurray, I thought, played this role so well and very convincingly. Surprisingly, he never got Oscar nominated for any of his performances. Perhaps the academy thought that this actor-who's most well known as the father on ""My Three Sons"" and had a track record in light comedies- wasn't prestigious enough to win the gold. It's like his against type roles in ""Double Indemnity"", ""The Apartment"" and this movie never existed!In the beginning of the film, we tended to dislike Queeg because he's a nut. He has the ship steam away from a combat mission, he orders no more movies to be shown, has constant practice drills and, when some strawberries turn up missing, has the ship searched and basically ripped apart in a futile search for a ""duplicate key to the icebox"". But at the end, when Keefer's plan is revealed, when sympathize with Queeg at how he was used and mistreated by his crew. For had the crew supported and helped the captain when he asked for it, things might have turned out different in the typhoon. This is one of Bogart's better roles, maybe his last great one, and it netted him his last Oscar nomination. He made only about 3 or four other movies after this one, with the last, ""The Harder they Fall"", being released in 1956. In February 1957, Bogart died of complications from throat cancer.If there is one problem with ""The Caine Mutiny"", it is the romance plot between Ensign Keith (Robert Francis) and his girlfriend May, played by May (Coincidental?). Keith's character is the first we are introduced too in the film. His involvement in the film is sort of like that of the newsreel reporter in ""Citizen Kane"": He serves as a guide, a plot device to the events that follow. And only a handful of scenes are dedicated to Keith and May. However, these end up in the way of the much more exciting action involving Queeg and the other officers. I have read Herman Wouk's novel and am aware that this wasn't manufactured for the film, but was actually in the book (And was the main plot, if I'm not mistaken). This shows how much the screenwriters tried to remain faithful to the book. But the only way the movie could have been truly faithful to the novel would be if it had been two and a half or even three hours long. With a roughly two-hour movie, the writers should have figured out what was more important to focus on. If they had either dumped or worked out the romance plot better so it fit more into the plot, the movie would have been even better.Otherwise, ""The Caine Mutiny"" is a great film, one that many persons can find something to like. Naval buffs will enjoy beautiful shots filmed aboard naval destroyers at port and sea to represent the DMS Caine. Fans of court room dramas will find a very tense, well played one that'll satisfy them (Though a 1988 T.V movie, ""The Caine Mutiny court-martial"", was said to do a better job. But having not seen that, I can't form an opinion). Bogie fans will most likely judge this one of his career highlights. And skeptics of Fred MacMurray's talent will be put to rest. Add in a supporting cast that includes Tom Tully, E.G Marshall and Lee Marvin, you have great entertainment, I kid you not!",5,"Strawberries, anyone?",1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,5457,"['Caine',
