342993,A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST,6302877903,Best Of All,"[3, 6]","The problem with many of the movies based on John le Carre's carefully woven books is the condensing of the plot, which ruins the overall development of the pace that is driven by the characters.The Little Drummer Girl is an ambitious novel, as le Carre meticulously constructs the evolution of Charlie from an English radical left-wing actress - who is anti-Zionist - to a Palestinian terrorist, with a vicious twist. She has handlers on both sides of the conflict.The movie changes Charlie - who allegedly is based on actress Vanessa Redgrave - to an American portrayed by Diane Keaton. Klaus Kinski plays Israeli spymaster Martin Kurtz, whose aim is to infiltrate the Kahlil terrorist organization and kill its leader, who has successfully carried out bombings of Jewish-related targets in Europe.Though working for the Israelis seems to go against the politics of Charlie, it is her growing love for her case officer, Joseph (Yorgo Voyagis), that seemingly drives her ambition. Touching on the psychological and physical consequences from being manipulated in the game of shadows, Charlie ultimately pays a heavy personal price.The movie stumbles on several levels. Keaton as a fledgling terrorist just doesn't work. The scenes at the training camp fail to convey the sacrifice and political conditioning of recruits. Also, the crucial blur between perceived good & evil that are mainstays of le Carre's novels is lost in the transistion from page to screen.The Little Drummer Girl was my favorite le Carre novel until the release of Single & Single.

Charlie, the protagonist is very fully developed as well.  She is an actress who needs more excitement, more commitment in her life.  This works out to Charlie's being recruited as a spy in the Arab-Israel conflict although Charlie is neither one.  Although she can talk effectively about ""the cause"", throughout you get the feeling that it is the thrill not the cause which makes Charlie tick.The filmmakers did one thing very, very right here.  They cast Diane Keaton to play Charlie.  Keaton is very capable of playing nuanced characters.  She is utterly believable as an actress who decides spying is her new double life, that she will really make a big difference to the world as a spy.  Keaton does not give short shrift to Charlie but the script here is just not as rich or dense as the novel. She basically takes the whole movie up on her shoulders and runs with it.

Diane Keaton in the lead role travels from the safety of her urban home far into the world of the terrorist training camps, and looks on with false disdain as a fellow operative who was discovered is executed.Accepting a mission to assist in a bombing, she travels back to Europe with a locator device hidden in a large radio given to her by her contact outside the terrorist network just before she boards her flight.Like Keaton's character, ""American Taliban"" John Lindh reportedly traveled deep into the al Qaeda training camp networks, and eventually declined an offer from Osama bin Laden to participate in a martyrdom mission that may have led him into the Sept. 11 plot.If you allow your imagination to follow the film's similarities into the story of Lindh as the Little Drummer Boy -- then events in the film and Afghanistan become interesting. In folklore, the Little Drummer Boy appears in the story of the Three Wise Men who travel from the east to bring gifts to the newborn Christ Child, or new born King. The story of the Three Wise Men is biblical, but the Little Drummer Boy is a song that may have gained traditional inclusion to add a populist theme to the original story.Similar to the Wise Men biblical story, during Ramadan of 2001, our most powerful military and political leaders traveled from the west into the deserts and hills of Afghanistan.  Also present under the sky that featured the most dramatic display of Leonid meteors in more than a quarter century were Osama bin Laden, and the Taliban's spiritual leader, Mullah Omar.  Finally, there was John Walker Lindh, whose story is surprisingly similar in some respects to LeCarre's film The Little Drummer Girl, and possibly the Little Drummer Boy.Islam is a young religion, and its growth now spans from Morocco to far Indonesia.  A view of the globe will show that its real center is no longer Mecca, but Kabul.

Jackson,"[2, 5]","The Little Drummer Girl has one glaring deficiency: the basis upon which the story rests is false.The film's antagonist, named Khalil, is a 'Palestinian' freedom fighter who doesn't want the 'Palestinian People' to wait 2,000 years, like the Jews waited, for the restoration of their 'homeland'. Khalil runs a highly effective terrorist network that bombs Israeli targets throughout Europe in order to advertise the 'Palestinian' cause.Adapted from John le Carr&eacute;'s novel of the same name, the film bases its story on the false historical claim that there is such an ethnic group called the 'Palestinians'. The only 'Palestinians' to have existed were citizens of the 1922 League of Nations' 'Mandate for Palestine', the Jewish Homeland. The term 'Palestinian' was only used for legal purposes to describe those living in the Jewish Homeland between 1922-1948. As such, Jews were also defined as 'Palestinians'. When Israel became a state in 1948 (changing its name from Palestine to Israel. The name Palestine was given to the territory in 135 AD by Emperor Hadrian as an insult to the Jews, who had just revolted against Roman rule for a second time. Palestine is the Romanized version of the name Philistine, the land of Israel's ancient enemies), the term 'Palestinian' became defunct, but was then co-opted by Arab governments and used to fool ignorant observers that the 'Palestinians' had lost their land to the Jews. John le Carr&eacute; presents the 'Palestinians' as an actual ethnic group with justified land claims against the Jewish state, when in fact there never was a 'Palestinian' ethnic group present in the Middle East. And here's the proof of the Arab governments' lie: Unless those who take the anti-Israeli side in this discussion can produce what should be the easy to find documents from the early 1920s where the 'Palestinian People' are demanding their state and being denied their demands by the League of Nations, then you have just proved to yourselves that the 'distinct Palestinian People' canard is just that-a canard.The Little Drummer Girl does have one saving grace, however, and that revolves around the Mossad recruitment of 'Charlie', an unknown actress with Vanessa Redgrave-like politics. Due to the latest bombing by Khalil of an Israeli target in Bad Godesberg, the Mossad must quickly neutralize Khalil and his network or else the politicians in Israel and the IDF will take matters into their own hands, which means indiscriminate reprisal attacks on Arab (not 'Palestinian') refugee camps, resulting in the deaths of women and children and another black eye for Israel in the court of world opinion.On the trail of the elusive Khalil is the Mossad's best operative-Kurtz, and his Mossad team. Kurtz's plan: use Charlie to infiltrate Khalil's network and hope to luck that once inside Khalil can be found.",3,Story based on a misnomer,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,2855,"['Little', 'Drummer', 'Girl', 'one', 'glaring', 'deficiency', 'basis', 'story', 'false.The', 'film', 'antagonist', 'named', 'Khalil', ""'Palestinian"", 'freedom', 'fighter', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', ""'Palestinian"", 'People', 'wait', '2,000', 'years', 'Jews', 'waited', 'restoration', ""'homeland"", 'Khalil', 'highly', 'effective', 'terrorist', 'network', 'Israeli', 'targets', 'Europe', 'order', 'advertise', ""'Palestinian"", 'cause.Adapted', 'John', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'story', 'false', 'historical', 'claim', 'such', 'ethnic', 'group', 'called', ""'Palestinians"", 'only', ""'Palestinians"", 'have', 'existed', 'were', 'citizens', '1922', 'League', 'Nations', ""'Mandate"", 'Palestine', 'Jewish', 'Homeland', 'term', 'was', 'only', 'used', 'legal', 'purposes', 'describe', 'living', 'Jewish', 'Homeland', '1922-1948', 'such', 'Jews', 'were', 'also', 'defined', ""'Palestinians"", 'When', 'Israel', 'became', 'state', '1948', 'changing', 'name', 'Palestine', 'Israel', 'name', 'Palestine', 'was', 'given', 'territory', '135', 'AD', 'Emperor', 'Hadrian', 'insult', 'Jews', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'revolted', 'Roman', 'rule', 'second', 'time', 'Palestine', 'Romanized', 'version', 'name', 'Philistine', 'land', 'Israel', 'ancient', 'enemies', 'term', ""'Palestinian"", 'became', 'defunct', 'was', 'then', 'co-opted', 'Arab', 'governments', 'used', 'fool', 'ignorant', 'observers', ""'Palestinians"", 'had', 'lost', 'land', 'Jews', 'John', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', ""'Palestinians"", 'actual', 'ethnic', 'group', 'justified', 'land', 'claims', 'Jewish', 'state', 'when', 'fact', 'never', 'was', ""'Palestinian"", 'ethnic', 'group', 'present', 'Middle', 'East', 'here', 'proof', 'Arab', 'governments', 'lie', 'who', 'take', 'anti-Israeli', 'side', 'discussion', 'can', 'produce', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'easy', 'find', 'documents', 'early', '1920s', 'where', ""'Palestinian"", 'People', 'are', 'demanding', 'state', 'being', 'denied', 'demands', 'League', 'Nations', 'then', 'have', 'just', 'proved', 'yourselves', ""'distinct"", 'Palestinian', 'People', 'canard', 'just', 'that-a', 'canard.The', 'Little', 'Drummer', 'Girl', 'have', 'one', 'saving', 'grace', 'however', 'Mossad', 'recruitment', ""'Charlie"", 'unknown', 'actress', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave-like', 'politics', 'Due', 'latest', 'bombing', 'Khalil', 'Israeli', 'target', 'Bad', 'Godesberg', 'Mossad', 'must', 'quickly', 'neutralize', 'Khalil', 'network', 'else', 'politicians', 'Israel', 'IDF', 'will', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'indiscriminate', 'reprisal', 'attacks', 'Arab', 'not', ""'Palestinian"", 'refugee', 'camps', 'resulting', 'deaths', 'women', 'children', 'black', 'eye', 'Israel', 'court', 'world', 'trail', 'elusive', 'Khalil', 'Mossad', 'best', 'operative-Kurtz', 'Mossad', 'team', 'Kurtz', 'plan', 'use', 'Charlie', 'infiltrate', 'Khalil', 'network', 'hope', 'luck', 'once', 'Khalil', 'can', 'be', 'found']",N/A

343004,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6302877903,Linda Linguvic,"[20, 26]","This 1984 film is based on the novel by John LeCarre and deals with a subject we've all become too familiar with lately:  terrorism.  Diane Keaton stars as a young woman who's into causes and even though she shows Palestinian sympathies, is still recruited by the Israeli Mosad to become an operative.  What follows is an entirely implausible plot that required utmost concentration to follow.Klaus Kinski played the part of the Israeli leader and even though he is a good actor, his Nordic looks made him hard to believe as an Israeli.  Yorgo Voyagis, a handsome Greek actor, played the Israeli agent who gets romantically involved with Keaton.  Problem is that their relationship never really sizzled and it was hard to believe she wound up putting herself in so much danger for a cause she felt so lukewarm about or for this man with whom she had few, if any, love scenes with.I liked Keaton in her role, cast as an actress with a rather ditzy personality.  The role called for her displaying her own insecurities as well as courage.  She also played it in a way to make it clear that she was attracted more to the adventure and the Israeli agent than she was to the politics.There's good cinematography and a fine sense of place.  Scenes are shot in Germany, England, Greece and the Middle East.  It all looks very real.  There's a moderate amount of tension, especially near the end, but the story itself lacks believability and emotional intensity.Times have changed since the film was produced, which was groundbreaking then because it showed the moral ambiguity and savage methods used by both the Israelis and Palestinians.

Layman Jr.,"[3, 4]","John le Carre is far and away my favorite spy-genre author, and The Little Drummer Girl one of my favorite books, along with the Karla trilogy (Tinker, Tailor; Honourable Schoolboy; Smiley's People).  I can't dispute some of the negative points in the other Amazon reviews, but still, the movie is wonderful.  And it is about as faithful to the book as you could hope for in a 2-hour production.I would've picked someone besides Diane Keaton for the role of Charlie.  She is outstanding in comedy, especially Woody Allen's Love and Death, not as good in dramatic roles.  Part of the problem is her maturity -- she just isn't the right type to play a naive, easily-influenced radical and Picadilly Circus sit-in demonstrator.  Still, she does a creditable acting job.The rest of the casting is perfect, especially Klaus Kinski as Kurtz, the Israeli spy master and counter-terror team leader, and Yorgo Voyagis, who recruits, manipulates, and ultimately falls in love with Charlie.  As you go through the movie, you are hit with one fine performance after another -- Thorley Walters as Ned Quilley, Charlie's agent; Sami Frey as Khalil, the arch terrorist; Eli Danker as Litvak, Kurtz's rabid assistant; Kerstin de Ahna and David Suchet as Helga and Mesterbein, the traveling German terror duo (a scary homage to Boris and Natasha?  Could le Carre be a Rocky and Bullwinkle fan?); and the youngsters of the counter-terror team, who judging by their names may actually have been Israelis.The best part of the movie, for me, is the painstaking recruitment of Charlie, culminating in  the ""audition,"" where the Israeli team breaks down her defenses, then embraces her as a member of the group.  This is pure le Carre, fraught with subtlety and deception, and is the sort of plotting that makes his stories so engrossing, and a little challenging.  His works don't depend on the car chases and exploding briefcases of Ian Fleming.Another delight is the inclusion of some of le Carre's best lines -- ""Cable them, 'Yes, repeat, No.'""  ""To catch the lion, first tether the goat.""  ""I've killed all the Palestinians I ever want to kill.""  And so on.Add a great musical score by Dave Grusin (Three Days of the Condor, The Fabulous Baker Boys), and you have a really enjoyable movie.

343014,AE46OA3BBMNWI,6302877903,Winter Maiden,"[1, 2]","Diane Keaton brings her full powers of neurotic commitment to the role of Charlie, the minor rep actress sufficiently known for her radical politics that--if Mossad can recruit her to their side--they can use her as a double agent to lure a Palestinian terrorist out of hiding. The problem with the movie is that the casting of Keaton and the writing of the character Charlie do irreparable violence to the character. A young English Palestinian sympathizer, as Charlie was in the book, has a whole different vibe than an older American version, and radicalism has a different history in the two countries, expressing itself in different ways. Also, Charlie is supposed to be a young, fiercely idealistic, upper-middle-class girl whose shaky sense of identity leads her to flounder into radical causes and abusive love affairs. When the enigmatic Joseph is dangled before her, she identifies him as the rock she's been longing for, and allows herself to be seduced into joining a Mossad plot to find and kill the terrorist. Keaton, good as she is, is twelve years too old to be convincing as an actress at the start of her career (and who claims her great teenage trauma happened only ten years previously, which is left in the movie) and not convincing as a honey-trap for an Arab playboy in his early twenties who likes to party with pretty young women.  The movie seems to pretend this isn't a problem, but it is a glaring strangeness at the heart of the movie.It's not just the casting of Keaton that's a problem.  The screenplay also betrays Charlie, who in the book is a truly good-hearted person whose confused politics stop at violence, but who is portrayed in the movie as attracted to Joseph because she thinks he's a terrorist.  The intelligent, capable Charlie of the book, who likes fast cars and is an excellent driver, is portrayed in the movie as the sort of ditz who accidentally puts cars in reverse and can't parallel park without doing major damage to the surrounding vehicles.  This is supposed to be comic relief.The casting of Greek actor Yorgo Voyagis is also a problem. Although handsome, stalwart, and velvet-voiced, he lacks the inner intensity that is supposed to draw Charlie to Joseph. Where the actor playing Joseph needs to be expressively inexpressive, Voyagis is just inexpressive, although he has a few good moments. I think Sami Frey (who plays the terrorist) would have been better cast as Joseph.Other than these issues, the movie is a reasonably competent espionage thriller, highly photogenic (except for the post-coital scene, where the actors are lit so unflatteringly that they look like moldy old cheese), and with Klaus Kinski and Eli Danker especially notable as the other key members of the Mossad team. Sami Frey's gentleness and sense of utter commitment make the terrorist memorable.""The Little Drummer Girl"" is a fine novel that deserves a better film version. Or perhaps ideally a television version that could do justice to the book's most extraordinary sequences: Joseph's skillful culling of the infatuated  yet doubtful Charlie from her friends; the shatteringly intense recruitment; the drive through Greece, in which three narratives are being layered simultaneously; and Charlie's training in Lebanon, where she meets the human face of terrorism and learns to love it, without ever losing her commitment to Joseph or to peace.
