1463069,A3CWRKJTB2SEQS,B005J4VV28,Careful Reviewer,"[4, 6]","These shows AND the quality of these shows can be found by free download all over the Internet. Additionally, this collection lacks the introduction, the short segments that introduced the commercial breaks, the next week's preview and the ending, all of which were a big part of the show. The only thing you get are the two 5-minute cartoon segments and the middle sing-a-longs from each ~half-hour show.",1,Incomplete Shows,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,405,"['shows', 'AND', 'quality', 'shows', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'free', 'download', 'Internet', 'Additionally', 'collection', 'introduction', 'short', 'segments', 'introduced', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'next', 'week', 'preview', 'ending', 'were', 'big', 'part', 'show', 'only', 'thing', 'get', 'are', 'two', '5-minute', 'cartoon', 'segments', 'middle', 'sing-a-longs', '~half-hour', 'show']",N/A

I am of an age group where this was my first exposure to Beatles' music, and I just wanted to see if it was anything like I remember it.The cartoons are the usual uber-cheap knockoffs typical of the times.  Don't expect any fancy animation here.  Likewise, the voices bear no similarity to the actual Beatles.  In fact, at least one of the voices involves an actor who must have been in every cartoon made in the 60's.  It's enjoyable in a nostalgic, laughable kind of way.The reason I gave this a somewhat low rating is that the video looks as though it was recorded off the TV to a VCR, and then transferred to DVD.  The image is generally soft and fuzzy throughout.  Of course, the cartoons are so lame they hardly rate an extensive remastering process.All in all, this is an acceptable product if you just want a stroll down memory lane. But I recommend trying 1 season before buying more.",3,Nostalgic Value Only,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,941,"['Purchased', 'total', 'nostalgic', 'indulgence', 'am', 'age', 'group', 'where', 'was', 'first', 'exposure', 'Beatles', 'music', 'just', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'anything', 'remember', 'it.The', 'cartoons', 'are', 'usual', 'uber-cheap', 'knockoffs', 'typical', 'times', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fancy', 'animation', 'here', 'Likewise', 'voices', 'bear', 'similarity', 'actual', 'Beatles', 'fact', 'least', 'one', 'voices', 'actor', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'cartoon', 'made', '60', 'enjoyable', 'nostalgic', 'laughable', 'kind', 'way.The', 'reason', 'gave', 'somewhat', 'low', 'rating', 'video', 'was', 'recorded', 'off', 'TV', 'VCR', 'then', 'transferred', 'DVD', 'image', 'generally', 'soft', 'fuzzy', 'course', 'cartoons', 'are', 'so', 'lame', 'hardly', 'rate', 'extensive', 'remastering', 'process.All', 'acceptable', 'product', 'just', 'want', 'stroll', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'recommend', 'trying', '1', 'season', 'buying', 'more']",N/A
1463071,A2BTXPTT5DCIA,B005J4VV28,Keith Black,"[6, 6]","This is the BEST release of these cartoons I've yet been able to find. After buying several different DVD-R versions of this old series over the years (since there are NO ""official authorized releases"") I find this ACME version to be the most complete & over-all best.The quality varies from quite good to excellent from volumes 1 thru 4. Volume 5 looks like it was transferred from analog to digital using lower-grade, but passable, methods.With each episode [as other reviewers wrote] you get a 2 cartoons with 2 sing-a-longs between them.Volume 2 has the original ""Show Lead-In"" that is missing on volume 1.Volume 3 has the original ""Show Lead-In"" and ""Exit"".Volume 5 has some of the ""link"" segments and 1 ""preview for next week"".Even though actual Beatles songs were used in this series, I've also long seen why any ex-Beatles and related people would have disliked it because of it's extra cheesey-ness and the way it portrays it's ""cartoon Ringo Starr"" as a total buffoon, which the real Richard Starkey is NOTHING like that, it would still be nice to have a full-quality ""authorized"" release someday.Many of the people involved in this show's original production also made the more accepted & famous ""Yellow Submarine"".
