1208656,A7U9GG09POJ02,B001KRCDRA,Erin,"[4, 6]","If you've seen people line dancing at a country bar you know there's a lot of foot-stomping and yee-haw'ing, smiling and knee-slapping good times going on. This dvd is not that. Nor does it even have that the country line-dance flavor. It's basic slow-moving aerobic motions. Step-together-step. Step-together-step. Do a little spin. Step-together-step. It's a line dance you'd teach to a pre-school class. Is it outright horrible and offensive? No. Is it a good time? No. The generic 'country' beat is brain-numbing. The two back-up instructors are wearing casual street clothes and the head-instructor is about as sexy as a caddle-prod and nearly as stiff. If you want a generic, gentle step-aerobic routine led by a robot so corporate it's an insult to any self-respecting redneck, this is the dvd for you. They obviously re-shot the cover to intice people to buy. Inside there's a monotone New-Mexico-Like set which is nothing like the outside Country-cover potrays. I hate it when they do that. The lack of creativity in the 'routine' is mockable. But it does have clean, boring cueing. It's unexciting. It's tame and bland. I've bought worse.

1208657,A1F3VRLGW5NAJB,B001KRCDRA,Gail,"[94, 94]","This dance DVD is a nice change of pace from the usual latin/jazz/hip hop routines that are typical in the marketplace.1.  There is a separate step guide that comes on this DVD.  Unless you are already familiar with line dancing, I strongly recommend you do the step guide first as the instructor does not slow down during the routines to teach you a new step.  In the step guide, the instructor walks you through the step in half time and then takes you up to speed.  You learn 10 new steps and some of them are a bit complicated. There is not a lot of repetition, so I even recommend you try the step guide a couple of times before doing the routines.2.  What I like about this DVD is that the steps are complicated and there are a lot of steps to a routine, so it keeps you interested.  If you're just looking for a simple dance routine, this may not be the one for you.  Normally, I can do most dance DVD's pretty well on the second or third attempt.  I think it will take me about 5 or 6 times before I get down all of the routines.3.  There is some hopping, so the DVD is not totally low impact.  If you don't hop, you can modify the steps fairly easily.4.  Because of the style of the dance, there is less upper body movement than the typical dance DVD. My feet stay pretty busy, so I don't miss the arm movements.  I have also found that this DVD is good for improving balance.5.  Like most dance DVD's, it does not give the very physically fit an challenging workout.  But it's fun and keeps you interested.6.  The instructor does a fair to good job of cuing, but there is some room for improvement.All in all, I do like this dance video and I recommend it as a lot of fun. If you like this DVD you may also like dance DVD's with Jennifer Galardi as the instructor.  She offers routines with similar intensity, slightly less complexity in the foot work and more upper body movement.

1208662,A2IHUNLHZWMNPP,B001KRCDRA,"Mer ""Alaska Girl""","[20, 21]","I own all of the Dance off the Inches series, and I really love this one!  It is so much fun, and line dancing is really a nice change of dance.  The instructor is southern style with excellent instruction and cueing.  The DVD is very well organized and the dances flow well.  I can see how it could seem low impact because line dancing doesn't use as many arm movements (thumbs are tucked in pockets or waistline).  However, I am an intermediate and found it to be a great workout.  I took my hands out of my pockets and let my arms flow with the moves.  Also, since line dancing can be tricky with the feet, since you're kicking  your ""boots"" up, it makes the routine easier to follow if you don't have alot of arm movements to incorporate.  I would really like to see more line dancing DVD's and the instructor did a wonderful job.  This is fun for a beginner or intermediate.  I should note that of all the Dance off the Inches DVD's, I have never had to use the step guide that is provided on the DVD.  However, this is the first time I did utilize the step guide.
