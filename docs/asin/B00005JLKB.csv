It seemed that the show only offered a couple minutes of ""super"" action and a lot of talk.  I also took in the various Superman cartoons and read a few of the comics.  However, I think the highpoint of my Superman experience was the 1978 movie.  To this day that is just about my favorite comic book to film transfer that I've seen.  Anyway I'm not a die hard fan of Superman and really didn't think much of SMALLVILLE one way or the other when I heard about it.Then about mid season I caught one of episodes and found I really liked it.  They have made some changes from the comic book and updated some of the characters to fit the current times.  I really like the way Lex Luther is portrayed.  He makes for an excellent morally challanged friend of Clark.  I was a bit disappointed that Lana was not a redhead but think that Kristin Kreuk does a fine job.  She and Clark, Tom Welling, have a nice chemistry.  When I found out Bo Duke...I mean John Schneider was going to play Jonathan Kent I was concerned he might not be able to shake his Bo Duke image.  I need not have worried, he did a fine job of leaving Bo Duke behind and making the role of Jonathan Kent his own.  Giving the role of Martha Kent to Annette O'Toole was a nice way to pay homage to the Superman film in which she portrayed an adult Lana Lang.  Although some people find Chloe Sullivan, Allison Mack, really annoying I really like her character.  The high school news reporter that is hot on the trail of Clark and the other Krypton generated oddities.During the first season of SMALLVILLE Clark is busy learning about his origins, learning how to use his powers and conceal them from his friends, and protecting the townsfolk from villans with Krypton generated powers.  These villans have received the nick name of ""Freak of the Weak"" villans.The DVD is nicely put together.  The special features are okay but improved upon in season two.  The picture transfer is crisp and offered in widescreen.  This seasons worth of DVD's is reasonably price and a real bargin for fans of the show.",5,Excellent take on an established comic book character!,1094601600,"09 8, 2004",2004,2160,"['child', 'growing', 'up', '1970', 'often', 'watched', '1950', 'black', 'white', 'version', 'Superman', 'seemed', 'show', 'only', 'offered', 'couple', 'minutes', 'super', 'action', 'lot', 'talk', 'also', 'took', 'various', 'Superman', 'cartoons', 'read', 'few', 'comics', 'However', 'think', 'highpoint', 'Superman', 'experience', 'was', '1978', 'movie', 'day', 'just', 'favorite', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'transfer', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'not', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'Superman', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'SMALLVILLE', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'when', 'heard', 'it.Then', 'mid', 'season', 'caught', 'one', 'episodes', 'found', 'really', 'liked', 'have', 'made', 'changes', 'comic', 'book', 'updated', 'characters', 'fit', 'current', 'times', 'really', 'way', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'portrayed', 'excellent', 'morally', 'challanged', 'friend', 'Clark', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Lana', 'was', 'not', 'redhead', 'think', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'fine', 'job', 'Clark', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'have', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'When', 'found', 'out', 'Bo', 'Duke', 'mean', 'John', 'Schneider', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'was', 'concerned', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'shake', 'Bo', 'Duke', 'image', 'need', 'not', 'have', 'worried', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'leaving', 'Bo', 'Duke', 'making', 'role', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'own', 'Giving', 'role', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'was', 'nice', 'way', 'pay', 'homage', 'Superman', 'film', 'portrayed', 'adult', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'people', 'find', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'really', 'annoying', 'really', 'character', 'high', 'school', 'news', 'reporter', 'hot', 'trail', 'Clark', 'other', 'Krypton', 'generated', 'oddities.During', 'first', 'season', 'SMALLVILLE', 'Clark', 'busy', 'learning', 'origins', 'learning', 'how', 'use', 'powers', 'conceal', 'friends', 'protecting', 'townsfolk', 'villans', 'Krypton', 'generated', 'powers', 'villans', 'have', 'received', 'nick', 'name', 'Freak', 'Weak', 'villans.The', 'DVD', 'nicely', 'put', 'together', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'okay', 'improved', 'upon', 'season', 'two', 'picture', 'transfer', 'crisp', 'offered', 'widescreen', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'reasonably', 'price', 'real', 'bargin', 'fans', 'show']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

I've been an avid fan of Smallville ever since it came out a couple years ago.  I still remember the first time I saw the commercial for it.  It was in a movie theater, but I forget what movie I was seeing at the time.  See, it's that good! LOL  Anyway, I've tried not to miss any episodes, but I know I've missed one here or there.  I was actually able to see an episode I never saw before after I bought this 1st season.  And here I thought I never missed an episode in the 1st season.  I can't wait till I get the 2nd season which is released on May 18.  I already pre-ordered it.  One more thing, I think the guy they picked to play Lex Luthor is perfect for the part.  I love his character, but I am a guy, so I don't like him that way. LOL  Also, the actress who plays Lana is HOT, and the one who plays Chloe is pretty cute.  All in all they have an awesome storyline, and it's a good wholesome family show.  The only thing I'm sad about is he hasn't been able to learn how to fly, and he hasn't created his suit yet, but the great stories they have more than make up for it.

You pay a price premium for that, but quite honestly, its just too high.  It will be a great time when digital purchase prices go down for this stuff.  Like movie rentals through amazon, which are priced fine in my opinion.But consider this, unlike disks, you cant re sell this.  I ended up paying less than $10 a season from a local buyer who I found on a certain popular website that specializes in local purchases and selling.I was going to burn the disks, that was the plan after purchase, but, I got lazy.  Its a lot of time to burn disks, which is why I was willing to pay the premium of this digital purchase.

Tom Welling is wonderfully cast as the teenage Clark Kent, an innocent, handsome, somewhat shy and clumsy youth with an infectious personality....popular and fiercely loyal to his friends and adoptive parents, Jonathan and martha Kent ( quite aptly played by John Schneider of Dukes of hazzard fame and Annette O'Toole). Filled with affection and effectively played out plotlines the story covers the weird effects the meteor storm has had on the Kansas township of Smallville and the array of strange powers endowed to many who's lives have been genetically altered by a substance in the meteor called Kryptonite....the early season deals with Clark's attempts to fit in as a normal teen with superhuman powers that he's only learning he has....special effects are phenomenal for a TV show and make it fun to watch. Filling out the cast areKristen Kreuk as tthe beautiful love interest Lana Lang, Clark's rich and powerful friend Lex Luthor (well played by Michael Rosenbaum), Allison Mack as the friend/Nancy Drew-like reporter, Chloe Sullivan and Sam Jones III as Clark's best friend, Pete Ross.The show is filled with great sci-fi weirdness and storylines to rivil Buffy, but this show stands alone as an excellent predicessor to the hit, Heroes....if you like Heroes and have not given this show a try...what are you waiting for???

601910,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00005JLKB,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[1, 1]","So this is how it all began, back in Smallville.  Smallville tells the story of a young Clark Kent, growing up and going to high school in a small Kansas farming town.  I was a little skeptical about this show when in first came on, but I have grown to love it.  As the story goes, Smallville used to be a normal town until one fateful day when Kal-el's (Tom Welling) home planet of Krypton exploded.  His father, Jor-el, sent him to Earth in a spaceship, and along with him came Kryptonite, little shards of the planet.  Kryptonite has very severe and diverse effects on the human genome, and due to exposure to this rock, many Smallville citizens are mutated.  Anyway, Kal-el is adopted by Jonathon and Martha Kent, a married couple who are incapable of conceiving a child of their own.  Renamed Clark Kent, he grows up with some very special gifts; super speed, strength, senses, and x-ray vision.  Unbeknownst to the Kents, this is because of our yellow sun (Krypton had a red sun, and so Clark gets these powers).  Along with his friends Pete, Chloe, and Lana (whom he has a huge crush on), Clark solves mysteries and saves people.  Also along for the ride, as well as many of his own, is Clark's future archnemesis Lex Luthor.  As of now, the two are great friends, but someday, somehow, they will become sworn enemies.The first part of the season is okay; the stories are good, but not as good as they will come to be, and they don't flow together.  Once the episodes begin to make an arc is when the season gets good.  If  you like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel, you will almost definitely like this show, for there are many similarities between this show and Buffy especially.  The main thing is that many of the stories are metaphors for lessons that teenagers need to learn such as why not to go on killer wait loss programs, and why you should be yourself.  Also, the Kryptonite's role in the show is exactly the same as that of the Hellmouth in Buffy.This is a great show that is definitely worth taking a look at.

I had watched Lois & Clark religiously, so to learn that Supes was back, but this time exploring his pre-Superman years as a mild-mannered teen in Smallville, well, needless to say I was pumped, and Season One of Smallville didn't disappoint.We got our first glimpses of Clark's developing superpowers, how he and Lex met and the friendship that would later help forge the greatest archrivalry of all time, Clark's Kryptonian heritage and more. Likewise, to meet Lana Lang for the first time and not just as a mere movie character but someone who--if you know even a chunk of the Superman backstory--made a huge impact on Clark as he grew up was especially interesting.I remember watching the season finale and flipping out over the cliffhanger ending.I've been watching the series ever since, every week, barely missing an episode.Check this series out if you haven't already.

601912,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JLKB,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[11, 12]","Who knew this would work?. While the WB is a wonderful network, one would be a bit hesitant when they first hear that they are going to do a show with Superman as a teen in Smallville. How many people didn't think ""Dawson's Creek"" meets ""The X Files""?. In a way, that's what it is at times, but it's good. Really good!. While the network is the king of teen angst, this show is normal and does it well. They don't have it too much as a soap opera, and the kids don't talk like they are 45 years old. I was also skeptical when they said that Clark wouldn't fly, have a costume, or have all of his powers yet. Fans who have always known and expected this of the Superman legacy, were probably a bit worried. I was. After the first episode, your worries are put out to pasture. That said, the show is a fantastic addition to the Superman legend. The first episode is a wonderful episode telling of Clark's arrival to Smallville and being taken in by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent. We are introduced to the cast of characters as well. Clark's high school crush Lana Lang, good buddy Pete, close friend Chloe, and of course, Lex Luthor. Many of the first season's episodes seemed to be the 'villain overtaken by kryptonite' kind of thing, but a lot of them are good. After the pilot, the next good episode is ""X Ray"", where a girl who is infected with kryptonite can metamorphis into anyone. It also appears that the girl is in love with Lana. Yikes. ""Cool"" is a fun episode about a kid who falls into a lake imbedded with the green K(again?!)and emerges frozen. He literally needs to suck the heat out of other people to stay alive. Another krptonite villain of the week, but an entertaining one. ""Leech"" has a classmate of Clark's getting Clark's superpowers after the two of them are hit by lightning on a class field trip. The results are dangerous and deadly. A really entertaining episode. ""Crush"" is a teriffic episode revolving around a former student who loses his hands and is able to move things with his mind. Might not sound overly original, but there are moments in this episode, especially towards the end, that make this one one of the best of the season. The best has been saved for last. The first season finale, titled ""Tempest"", is a great fun ride. Many things are going on with our characters, but the main thing about this one is that a tornado is hitting town. A fantastic episode. The conclusion, which is the second season premiere, is mind blowingly better. There are more good episodes here, but these are the best. Even it's weakest episodes, like ""Metamorphosis"", ""Jitters"", ""Shimmer"", ""Hug"", ""Kinetic"", and ""Stray"", are still better than most shows on TV. The production values on this show are outstanding. Many scenes are filmed in wonderful slow motion in a ' matrix ' type style that is perfectly executed. There is also the cast. Tom Welling is a perfect Clark Kent. He's not going to win an emmy, but he does a real and believeable job as Clark. He is always good to watch. His parents are played by John Schneider and Annette 'O' Toole. They couldn't be any better. They seem like real parents. They don't get a whole lot to do, but even when they don't, they are still great to watch because they are good and very likeable people. Kristin Kreuk as Lana. Wow. The first time I saw her I wanted to jump into the set. An amazing beauty. I hope the show lasts a long time because I love it, but also because we'll be able to see her every week. Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor is outstanding. He's probably the best of the bunch. He seems like a nice, likeable guy, but you can see that there could be something lurking underneath. This is pulled off well because of Rosenbaum's wonderful portrayal. It's so fascinating to watch him and Clark together and look at their relationship when you know what it will come too in the future. John Glover, as Lionel Luthor, is equally as good. The theme song, ""Save Me"", by Remy Zero, is another great plus to the show. There you have it. This is a stylish, well made, well put together show that is non stop fun and entertaining.

601916,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B00005JLKB,B. Martin,"[2, 2]","Superman has always been one of the squarest superheroes of all time thanks to his unflagging sense of nobility and his unwavering moral compass, not to metion his super skill set which allows him to do just about anything.  Without any true angst guiding his actions and no real sense of mortality, he's a fairly bland hero.  If anything, he's more of a symbol than a man.  So a series devoted to his formative years never really sparked my interest.  But over a decade after it first debuted, I found myself finally entering the world of Smallville and ending up pleasantly surprised with its imagination and heart.The series focuses on the midwestern town where a young Clark Kent grew up before heading to Metropolis and becoming The Man of Steel.  Tom Welling has the lead role and he does a fine job of portraying the hero in waiting as a normal teen with extraordinary gifts who just wants to be normal and fit in with his friends.  Those gifts include super strength, invincibility and x-ray vision among others, and Clark is tasked with the unenviable burden of keeping them a secret for fear of unintentionally hurting someone or being exploited and treated as a science expirement.  In addition to that responsibility, he also deals with his feelings for Lana Lang, forges an uneasy friendship with a young Lex Luthor and fends off a series of Smallvillians who have been given various powers by the same meteor shower that brought him to Smallville.The first season sticks closely to that premise and the result is an extremely entertaining and genuinely sincere portrait of adolescence and all of the complications and expectations that come with it, especially when you are destined for greatness and don't have any idea how to deal with it.  It seems the greatest superhero of them all had his share of apprehension and confusion after all.  Being a hero isn't supposed to be easy and Smallville's first season is a refreshing reminder of that very fact.",4,Local Hero,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,1969,"['Superman', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'squarest', 'superheroes', 'time', 'thanks', 'unflagging', 'sense', 'nobility', 'unwavering', 'moral', 'compass', 'not', 'metion', 'super', 'skill', 'set', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'true', 'angst', 'guiding', 'actions', 'real', 'sense', 'mortality', 'fairly', 'bland', 'hero', 'anything', 'more', 'symbol', 'man', 'series', 'devoted', 'formative', 'years', 'never', 'really', 'sparked', 'interest', 'decade', 'first', 'debuted', 'found', 'finally', 'entering', 'world', 'Smallville', 'ending', 'up', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'imagination', 'heart.The', 'series', 'midwestern', 'town', 'where', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'grew', 'up', 'heading', 'Metropolis', 'becoming', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'lead', 'role', 'fine', 'job', 'portraying', 'hero', 'waiting', 'normal', 'teen', 'extraordinary', 'gifts', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'normal', 'fit', 'friends', 'gifts', 'include', 'super', 'strength', 'invincibility', 'x-ray', 'vision', 'others', 'Clark', 'tasked', 'unenviable', 'burden', 'keeping', 'secret', 'fear', 'unintentionally', 'hurting', 'someone', 'being', 'exploited', 'treated', 'science', 'expirement', 'addition', 'responsibility', 'also', 'feelings', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'uneasy', 'friendship', 'young', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'off', 'series', 'Smallvillians', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'various', 'powers', 'same', 'meteor', 'shower', 'brought', 'Smallville.The', 'first', 'season', 'sticks', 'closely', 'premise', 'result', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'genuinely', 'sincere', 'portrait', 'adolescence', 'complications', 'expectations', 'come', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'destined', 'greatness', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'deal', 'greatest', 'superhero', 'had', 'share', 'apprehension', 'confusion', 'Being', 'hero', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'easy', 'Smallville', 'first', 'season', 'refreshing', 'reminder', 'very', 'fact']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

Following a slew of TV renditions of the character's life since the comic book first appeared, Smallville sets itself apart by focusing on the lesser discussed niche of Clark's earliest developmental days. Superb casting and consistent writing have combined to make Smallville one of the more popular shows on television (especially in international markets), making the show one of the WB network's most successful creations to date...Tom Welling stars in the imminent role of teenager Clark Kent, a refugee from the dying planet of Krypton. His ship having landed in the rural American town of Smallville, Clark is raised by locals Martha (Annette O'Toole) and Jonathan Kent (John Schneider - of Dukes of Hazzard fame) as their own son. Unlike some of the film and TV spin-offs, Smallville attributes powers to other individuals in the area as a result of some of the debris associated with Krypton's destruction. As a result, Clark is forced to keep his own powers a secret while battling against other individuals who are more powerful than traditional human criminal elements. The show also provides a glimpse into the early friendship experienced between Clark and Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) as well as Clark's romance with two high school classmates, Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) and Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk). Part sci-fi fantasy and part teenage soap, Smallville is an instant television classic...The Smallville (Season 1) DVD offers a number of exciting episodes including the series premiere in which the stage for the series is set by recounting the story of Clark's voyage to earth in the aftermath of Krypton's destruction. Clark meets Lex Luthor for the first time as well as a human mutated by the strange green rocks which accompanied Clark's spacecraft in the meteor shower...

I have yet to finish the season but there are pluses to this show.. Lex Luther is the big one! his character is the most intruiging because you know he will become a nemises to Clarke but the question for me anywayz.. is how? how does he become a darker character then he is atm? and Michael Rausenbaum has def lived up to the challenge of playing this role of a very conflicted character!Clarke Kent has struggles of his own. he wants to be with Lana but he doesn't want any enemies so he's letting Whitney stay with her as he really needs her atm. now as for Tom Welling.. gets the title role thx to his gorgeous body. his acting abilities are extremely limited.the parents have very limited acting abilities. and never really fully commit to their roles. we believe their good people and they have good intentions but the way they convey their emotions is not gonna win them any oscars. there's no passion in it.Lana Lang.. well I'm waiting for her character to develop a little more. she's not that interesting yet. but Kristin Kreuk shows she can change it up a little. I think she's better when she's got attitude! this whole good girl image is not her strength acting wise. tho she's far better an actor then Tom Welling at any rate. but that's not saying much.the best actor of the younger cast.. is by far Allison Mack who has similar traits to Lana only she conveys them in a much more synthetic matter! I believe she has the best intentions and has definitely commited to her role!the plot is episode by episode basis.. the villains are one dimensional and uninterested and sometimes just plain weird. I guess this show gets more interesting as it goes on.I'm mostly watching this cause James Marsters comes in later on in the 5th season and I don't wanna jump in halfway thru. and Lex Luther is interesting enough to keep me going from episode to episode! and the episodes are interesting but just bizarre and the lack of passion from the actors(with 2 exceptions) takes away the great potential this show has.those are just my thoughts. I appreciate any comments! it might get better the more I watch it.. and maybe the acting gets better. i'm not sure. I'm just commenting on what I've seen. and the father did have one good episode where he shows some attitude! and he quite commits to his role!

And also ever since then, I've been watching the show every Tuesday night and have not missed an episode. ""Smallville"" is the story of the teenage Clark Kent (Tom Welling), living in the town of Smallville, Kansas, who will one day be known to the world as ""Superman"". In the first season, we learn that Clark is an alien with super powers. He has amazing abilities such as super-strength, can run as fast as the speed of light, and has X-ray vision. But all Clark wants is to be able to fit in with the rest of his peers. He is also trying to win over the affection of the beautiful Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk), who is dating their high school's football star, Whitney Fordman (Eric Johnson). Clark lives with his human adoptive parents, Martha Kent and Jonathan Kent (Annette O'Toole and John Schneider) on the Kent Farm, and befriends the rich Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), after he saves Lex from a car accident. Clark also has two other friends, Pete Ross (Sam Jones III) and Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack), who help him out.The plots in every episode keep getting better and better. The storyline is amazing and every actor is superb in their roles. The special effects are great, too. I really hope they bring ""Smallville"" to complete season DVDs because it really is one of the best shows out there right now.

I wish I had started watching it earlier than now (2007). I expected low budget & fair effects from a (then) fledgling ""network."" The pilot blew me away. And it went on from there to do what it does best- it makes every character from this comic phenomenon HUMAN. Including, ironically, Clark Kent himself. The actor is great- plays him as so naive and trusting- you can't help but like this dude. And Lex- Man- this actor portrays Luthor better than ANY movie incarnation. You want to like this guy- and yet you're still a bit afraid of what he might do. Maybe it's because they have time to develop this character. The movies only portray a stereotype of what we expect form L.L.- an evil smart guy- no depth. The show makes you care for almost everyone.

601924,AYXZU81PMZBKC,B00005JLKB,"Christopher Wood ""anima300""","[0, 1]","Not to be entirely anecdotal, but I was never a fan of Superman when I was a kid.  I didn't like the movies a hell of a lot, and Lois and Clark with Dean Cain, and Teri Hatcher just didn't do it for me.  Of course, I was a little kid, so, what would you expect?I got turned onto Smallville from a friend just a short time ago.  All I knew about it was, it was about young teenage version of Superman, and there were ""freaks"" of the week, and that went against basically everything I like about primetime drama, because, I am a huge fan of season arcs...  Be that as it may, this ended up to be a great show.But this show was clever.  It wasn't about Clark Kent speeding around bends showing off his alien power to save the weak.  He did that every episode, but it ends up being more of a side plot in a way, because we learn more and more about our characters, and we get to watch them grow every episode.  They try to make this as human as possible, while keeping the superman myths alive, which is what makes this show as successful and enjoyable as it is.Clark Kent (Tom Welling), was dropped from the planet Krypton during a meteor shower, pretty much into the hands of Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole, respectively).  During this meteor strike, a little girl is orphaned (Lana Lang, later played by the exquisite Kristin Kreuk), and a little boy is struck bald (Lex Luthor, played incredibly by Michael Rosenbaum).  Aware of Clark's abilities, the Kents try to raise him as a normal human being, in spite of his abilities, attempting to keep them a secret from society, trying to avoid the notoreity from the rest of the world, which also makes for some interesting confrontations between Clark and his friends.  Add to the mix, a glorified school newspaper reporter, Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack), who's interest in the meteor rocks and the weird things that happen in Smallville causes her to be a great help to Clark, her best friend, and unrequited love interest.  His best friend, Pete, is also there along the ride (Sam Jones III).Clark loves Lana, but never really has the gall to do anything about it, not only because of fear, but also because of her uber popular boyfriend star quarterback, Whitney (Eric Johnson), and the wonderful kryptonite necklace she wears as a memoire to her fallen parents.All-in-all, the main story arc pretty much of the whole series doesn't really come into full play until the final four or five episodes...  Most of these are ""monster of the week"" variety.  It is all very good TV though.

I have to say that I was disappointed.One of the biggest problems is that Smallville has deja vu syndrome; that is, it seems to develop through certain situations but reverts right back to where it came from. Case in point: Clarke decides he wants to go to a concert with Lana. Although it is interrupted, they have a good time and get closer. In the next episode, though, Lana is still with her boyfriend and she and Clarke are written as if nothing has happened.The freak-of-the-week setup is another problem. For almost every episode, some person develops some weird problem thanks to meteor leftovers. This affects Clark (or a friend/family member) and he saves the day. I realize that many good shows have formulas, but that's rediculous.The acting from almost everyone is quite good, but some of the cast members have trouble overcoming clich&eacute;d characterization. The best examples of this are Clarke's parents-- you can practically predict the words that will come out of their mouthes.I liked Smallville enough to watch the second season, but if it isn't any better I won't be continuing.",3,A decent show aimed at teens,1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,1259,"['was', ""n't"", 'viewer', 'when', 'first', 'season', 'Smallville', 'aired', 'television', 'rented', 'set', 'last', 'weekend', 'hearing', 'great', 'things', 'several', 'friends', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed.One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'Smallville', 'deja', 'vu', 'syndrome', 'develop', 'certain', 'situations', 'reverts', 'right', 'back', 'where', 'came', 'Case', 'point', 'Clarke', 'go', 'concert', 'Lana', 'interrupted', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'get', 'closer', 'next', 'episode', 'though', 'Lana', 'still', 'boyfriend', 'Clarke', 'are', 'written', 'nothing', 'happened.The', 'freak-of-the-week', 'setup', 'problem', 'almost', 'episode', 'person', 'weird', 'problem', 'thanks', 'meteor', 'leftovers', 'Clark', 'friend/family', 'member', 'day', 'realize', 'many', 'good', 'shows', 'have', 'formulas', 'rediculous.The', 'acting', 'almost', 'everyone', 'quite', 'good', 'cast', 'members', 'have', 'trouble', 'overcoming', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'characterization', 'best', 'examples', 'are', 'Clarke', 'parents', 'can', 'practically', 'predict', 'words', 'will', 'come', 'mouthes.I', 'liked', 'Smallville', 'enough', 'watch', 'second', 'season', ""n't"", 'better', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'continuing']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

Every week there's a local teen who through green rocks(which we know as Kryptonite), they possess special abilities: shapeshifting, bee commanding, bodyheat draining and a kid who can read minds. Despite the &quot;freak of the week&quot; structure, it's very enjoyable tv and stay tuned for Season 2 which explores even more into Clark's history(including the famed red kryptonite episode)A great introduction which deals with one of the most popular icons of the last century",5,The best WB show since Buffy,1064188800,"09 22, 2003",2003,1328,"['Superhero', 'tv', 'shows', 'barely', 'work', 'often', 'have', 'trouble', 'adapting', 'source', 'material', 'show', 'vision', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'remember', 'Well', 'here', 'most', 'beloved', 'character', 'comicdom', 'next', 'Batman', 'being', 'faithfully', 'adapted.Clark', 'Kent', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'mainly', '2', 'things', 'life', 'going', 'rather', 'inhuman', 'abilities', 'run', 'high', 'speeds', 'show', 'blur', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'more', 'abilities', 'way', 'other', 'pining', 'love', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'played', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'one', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Earth', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'dating', 'star', 'football', 'player', 'Whitney', 'Fordman', 'Clark', 'best', 'friends', 'school', 'are', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'very', 'good-looking', 'too', 'nowhere', 'Kristin', 'Pete', 'Sam', 'Jones', 'III', 'episodes', 'play', 'out', 'very', 'episode-like', 'fashion', 'Season', '2', 'continuing', 'plot', 'week', 'local', 'teen', 'who', 'green', 'rocks', 'know', 'Kryptonite', 'possess', 'special', 'abilities', 'shapeshifting', 'bee', 'commanding', 'bodyheat', 'draining', 'kid', 'who', 'can', 'read', 'minds', 'quot', 'freak', 'week', 'quot', 'structure', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'tv', 'stay', 'tuned', 'Season', '2', 'even', 'more', 'Clark', 'history', 'including', 'famed', 'red', 'kryptonite', 'episode', 'A', 'great', 'introduction', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'icons', 'last', 'century']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)
601927,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,B00005JLKB,CodeMaster Talon,"[21, 23]","Surprise, surprise. Blithely ignoring the protests of fanboys and the head-shaking of nay-sayers, the WB's Superman series ""Smallville"" turns out to be quite watchable. More than that; even GOOD. Interesting characters, top-notch acting and some lucky breaks for the network as far as casting goes made the series a smash that continues to garner impressive ratings. In the first ""Smallville"" DVD we are presented with the Pilot episode in wonderful widescreen, along with some commentary from the producers and director.The Pilot episode, rather blandly titled ""Premeire"", sets up the story for us nicely, if not particularly excitingly. Typical peaceful and idylic middle-America town Smallville is the corn capital of the US, until one fateful day when the sky suddenly starts raining meteors. Water-towers fall, cars are blown sky-high and many people are killed, including the parents of sweet four year old Lana Lang.  Lionel Luthor, head of LuthorCorp, is visting his Smallville plant with his son when the meteors hit; his son survives a close call, although his hair unfortunately does not. And we must not forget the goodhearted Kents, who discover something unexpected in a still-smoldering cornfield.The action then fast forwards ten or so years later; and we get to know the people of Smallville. The Kents have named their discovery Clark (Tom Welling) and raised him as their own, although initially he does not know the truth about his origins. Clark is hopelessly in love with the orphaned Lana Lang, played by the radient Kristen Kreuk. Problems for Clark arrive in the form of the scattered meteor rocks, which make Clark extremely sick whenever they are in his vicinity. The adult Lex Luthor also lives in Smallville, and he and Clark strike up a tentative friendship.The strength of the show is definitely the casting, which is uniformly first-rate. Tom Welling as the young Clark Kent is solid, managing to convey the slight awkwardness that plagues Clark while giving him a strong moral balance. Kristin Kreuk as his love interest is lovely and exudes a wistful kindness. Allison Mack as Clark's friend Chloe is spunky and funny, and acclaimed actor John Glover is fittingly slimy as Lionel Luthor.And then there is Michael Rosenbaum. He is without a doubt the series' Ace. Rosenbaum plays Lex Luthor in the same spirit most actors play Hamlet; shrewd yet tortured, strong yet vulnerable, longing to let the good in him shine through while simultaneously fearing it a weakness. All that Rosenbaum requires is a few strong plot lines and he will make Lex the most complex and interesting character on TV today.Which brings us to the writing, the show's weak point. Not exactly bad, and sometimes actually quite good, most of the time it is lackluster. Uninteresting villians and frequent implausibilty put a damper on a great concept.  The show survives on the appeal of the clean-cut Welling and the amazingly sexy Rosenbaum , but better writing could guarantee this show a gigantic following. Let's hope.All in all, a decent start to a show that is getting slowly better episode by episode. You'll catch this one from the begining if you're smart; it's going places.",4,"And The Comic gods Looked Down, and Lo!,  It was Good",1025913600,"07 6, 2002",2002,3190,"['Surprise', 'surprise', 'Blithely', 'ignoring', 'protests', 'fanboys', 'head-shaking', 'nay-sayers', 'WB', 'Superman', 'series', 'Smallville', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'watchable', 'More', 'even', 'GOOD', 'Interesting', 'characters', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'lucky', 'breaks', 'network', 'as', 'far', 'casting', 'made', 'series', 'smash', 'garner', 'impressive', 'ratings', 'first', 'Smallville', 'DVD', 'are', 'presented', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'wonderful', 'widescreen', 'commentary', 'producers', 'director.The', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'rather', 'blandly', 'titled', 'Premeire', 'up', 'story', 'nicely', 'not', 'particularly', 'excitingly', 'Typical', 'peaceful', 'idylic', 'middle-America', 'town', 'Smallville', 'corn', 'capital', 'US', 'one', 'fateful', 'day', 'when', 'sky', 'suddenly', 'raining', 'meteors', 'Water-towers', 'fall', 'cars', 'are', 'blown', 'sky-high', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'including', 'parents', 'sweet', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Lionel', 'Luthor', 'head', 'LuthorCorp', 'visting', 'Smallville', 'plant', 'son', 'when', 'meteors', 'hit', 'son', 'close', 'call', 'hair', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'must', 'not', 'forget', 'goodhearted', 'Kents', 'who', 'discover', 'something', 'unexpected', 'still-smoldering', 'cornfield.The', 'action', 'then', 'fast', 'forwards', 'ten', 'so', 'years', 'later', 'get', 'know', 'people', 'Smallville', 'Kents', 'have', 'named', 'discovery', 'Clark', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'raised', 'own', 'initially', 'not', 'know', 'truth', 'origins', 'Clark', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'orphaned', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'played', 'radient', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'Problems', 'Clark', 'arrive', 'form', 'scattered', 'meteor', 'rocks', 'make', 'Clark', 'extremely', 'sick', 'whenever', 'are', 'vicinity', 'adult', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'also', 'Smallville', 'Clark', 'strike', 'up', 'tentative', 'friendship.The', 'strength', 'show', 'definitely', 'casting', 'uniformly', 'first-rate', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'solid', 'managing', 'convey', 'slight', 'awkwardness', 'Clark', 'giving', 'strong', 'moral', 'balance', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'love', 'interest', 'lovely', 'wistful', 'kindness', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'Clark', 'friend', 'Chloe', 'spunky', 'funny', 'acclaimed', 'actor', 'John', 'Glover', 'fittingly', 'slimy', 'Lionel', 'Luthor.And', 'then', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'doubt', 'series', 'Ace', 'Rosenbaum', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'same', 'spirit', 'most', 'actors', 'play', 'Hamlet', 'shrewd', 'yet', 'tortured', 'strong', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'longing', 'let', 'good', 'shine', 'simultaneously', 'fearing', 'weakness', 'Rosenbaum', 'few', 'strong', 'plot', 'lines', 'will', 'make', 'Lex', 'most', 'complex', 'interesting', 'character', 'TV', 'today.Which', 'writing', 'show', 'weak', 'point', 'Not', 'exactly', 'bad', 'sometimes', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'most', 'time', 'lackluster', 'Uninteresting', 'villians', 'frequent', 'implausibilty', 'put', 'damper', 'great', 'concept', 'show', 'appeal', 'clean-cut', 'Welling', 'amazingly', 'sexy', 'Rosenbaum', 'better', 'writing', 'could', 'guarantee', 'show', 'gigantic', 'following', 'Let', 'hope.All', 'decent', 'start', 'show', 'getting', 'slowly', 'better', 'episode', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'catch', 'one', 'begining', ""'re"", 'smart', 'going', 'places']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)
601928,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,B00005JLKB,Crystal Starr Light,"[1, 1]","I got hooked on Smallville with this very season.  My sister went out on a limb and bought the entire first season.  We didn't know if we would like it, but we thought ""What the heck?""What an understatement!  This is an amazing series!  The characters are so diverse, from the humble farmboy, Clark, to the high energy Chole, best friend Pete, girl-next-door Lana, and the rich boy, Lex.""Pilot"": Clark's ship lands in Smallville in 1989.  Present day, Clark gets in trouble with Whitney, Lana's boyfriend.  Former hazing victim, now equipped with electrical powers, comes back to torment and kill the football jocks.  This is a great start to the series.  I love the beginning, with Lionel and a young Lex in the heliocopter. 5/5""Metamorphosis"": Kid gets infected with bugs and turns into one, torments Lana.  Man, this episode can scare the crap out of you.  Not my favorite episode, but still pretty interesting.  Clark ""flies"" in this one. 4/5""Hothead"": Gym teacher with a hot temper can create fire.  Good special effects and definitely interesting (particularly with special guest John Glover)! 4/5""Xray"": Tina develops an unhealthy attachment to friend Lana; Clark discovers his X-Ray vision.  I love the opening sequence where it appears Lex is robbing the bank.  5/5""Cool"": Ladies' man jock falls into a lake and can't get warm.  Starts going after his old girlfriends and freezing them solid.  This one is pretty terrifying and showcases Chloe beautifully.  4.5/5""Hourglass"": An older man is able to switch to his younger self and attempt to enact revenge on the Jurists who put him in jail.  I love how Cassandra sees Clark's future and then Lex's.  5/5""Craving"": Guest star Amy Adams is a fat girl who wants to get thin.  She does, but then develops a ""craving"" for fat.  Chloe meets Lex in this episode and Pete gets himself a date.  4.5/5""Jitters"":  Earl Jenkins holds LuthorCorp hostage, trying to find Level 3 and a cure for his jitters.  An AMAZING episode, probably one of my favorites of the season.  We get to see how Lionel ""handles"" the situation, Chloe's dad, and Lex's self-sacrificial attitude.  5/5""Rogue"":  A dirty cop finds out Clark's secret and forces the farm boy to assist him in crime.  Not one of my favorites (no one real reason).  4/5""Shimmer"":  Someone is tormenting Victoria at Lex's mansion.  It looks like it's Lex's teenaged admirer...  I love seeing Lex in this episode, particularly with his interactions with Victoria and his father.  5/5""Hug"":  A travelling salesman with the ability to force people to change their minds comes to Smallville and build a toxic planet nearby.  Enjoyable episode, particularly the part where Lex becomes a machine-gun wielding psycho killer.  4.5/5""Leech"":  Geeky kid (Shawn Ashmore) sneaks Clark's powers and becomes super famous...and super burdened.  I really wasn't fond of the kid, how arrogant he became, but did like how Lex manipulated Victoria and her father.  3/5""Kinetic"":  Three thieves who can move through walls and blackmail Lex.  Kinda stupid (the meteor-rock tattoos were over the top), but I enjoyed seeing Lex scramble for his lost items and Whitney really turn around.  3.5/5""Zero"":  The events at Club Zero come back to haunt Lex.  Nice episode, showing both the good and bad sides of Lex.  5/5""Nicodemus"":  A flower with the ability to change a person's behavior infects Jonathan...and then Lana...and then Pete.  I liked seeing the new Jonathan and Lana and how it ties in with Dr. Hamilton, brought up in the ""Jitters"" episode.  5/5""Stray"":  A young boy who can read people's minds is being used to commit crimes but flees to Jonathan and Martha's farm.  I love the interactions between Clark and Ryan, Ryan reveals Chloe's feelings for Clark, and Lionel tempting his son with a job in Metropolis.  4.5/5""Reaper"":  A young man is able to turn people to ash.  I love how Lex deals with the man Lionel sent to ""babysit"" Lex!  4/5""Drone"":  The race for class president gets out of hand when two of the candidates are attacked by bees.  I like how Clark tries to run for president and how Pete assists him. 4/5""Crush"":  A former art student, now equipped with telekinesis, returns to school and begins to enact revenge for the hit and run that ruined his skills.  We get to see Chloe have a brief romance and Lana get jealous.  4.5/5""Obscura"":  Lana develops a power to see through a kidnapper's eyes, which she must use to save Chloe.  The ""who-did-it"" is pretty lame and nothing is very interesting in my opinion.  3/5""Tempest"":  Lionel closes the plant, Clark takes Chloe to the spring formal, and Lana takes Whitney to the bus station...when a tornado hits.  A nice way to end the season, with all people in an uncertain future.  4.5/5Many people criticize the first season as being very ""Monster of the Week"".  It is true for the most part, but still, it is an enjoyable season.  You are introduced to the strange world of Smallville, the wonderful characters, and the beginnings of the Superman legend.  I highly recommend.Brought to you by*C.S.

And watch the entire 21 episodes and to my surprise it was very different. And I found myself holding on to it with the characters, the stories and the best part of all, its the human touch and drama.Everything was well written. The characters were interesting, the story isn't stupid or dumb but intelligent.

601938,A1EEJLIAC40FBF,B00005JLKB,D. Barrett,"[5, 8]","I've been watching Smallville Season One while exercising. It's built on a great premise -- the Man of Steel before he grew into full superness -- but the show is extremely flawed. It does have some good parts: the character of Clark, his friendship with Lex Luthor, premonitions of Lex's future menace, and the sweetness of the Clark/Lana relationship. But some parts of this show are just too stupid for words. Let's start with the writing. The dialog is so cliched that you can predict it, word for word, at least 30 seconds before it's spoken. And the plots are just insipid and embarrassingly similar from show to show: pick a random Smallville-ite and give him/her a kryptonite-fueled power that just happens to be an ironic twist on their personality. The guy who gets angry easily? Give him fire. The bug-lover? Turn him into a bug. And wait... we had a fire guy, so how about a cold guy next? And then a bee girl!  It's a rogues' gallery of the pathetic, going beyond ""comic-booky"" (which could be fun) into plain stupid.Now let's talk about characters. Chloe is the worst, a limp attempt at a ""Willow"" character from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". No matter what the situation is, no matter how little evidence is around, Chloe instantly leaps to the correct, implausible solution (""Hmm, that girl MUST be controlling the killer bees by emitting a queen bee scent."") It's as if she has a direct mental channel to the script. Then there's Pete, a character so insubstantial that I couldn't even remember his name after a dozen episodes. Continuing the ""Buffy"" analogy, he's the Xander character, but Xander was actually witty and charming. Pete is barely noticeable: we're supposed to believe he's ""Clark's best friend"" but he doesn't actually do anything remotely interesting. The rest of the characters (Ma & Pa Kent, Lionel Luthor) are played like stereotypes: not bad, just unoriginal and predictable.But perhaps the worst aspect of the show is its complete lack of suspense. In every episode, you always know who the bad guy is from the very beginning. Given that Clark is invulnerable and the main characters aren't likely to die, you know how every show is going to unfold and end. Add in the cliched dialog, and the plot just evaporates. To compare with another ""super-teen"" show, ""Buffy"" succeeded in this domain because the characters were strong, the dialog was clever, and the plots had surprising twists, even when the vampire parts got dumb.There is the occasional flash of brilliance, like the episode with the rogue cop who blackmails Clark (thankfully, no kryptonite-poisoning in sight) and when Cassandra takes Lex's hand to see his future. Other than these rarities, the show is barely watchable, even painfully bad sometimes. I give it 3 stars for being just enough to take my mind off the treadmill.  (I stick with it because I'm curious to watch Clark & Lex mature.)",3,"Mindless, flawed entertainment",1273708800,"05 13, 2010",2010,2894,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Smallville', 'Season', 'One', 'exercising', 'built', 'great', 'premise', 'Man', 'Steel', 'grew', 'full', 'superness', 'show', 'extremely', 'flawed', 'have', 'good', 'parts', 'character', 'Clark', 'friendship', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'premonitions', 'Lex', 'future', 'menace', 'sweetness', 'Clark/Lana', 'relationship', 'parts', 'show', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'stupid', 'words', 'Let', 'start', 'writing', 'dialog', 'so', 'cliched', 'can', 'predict', 'word', 'word', 'least', '30', 'seconds', 'spoken', 'plots', 'are', 'just', 'insipid', 'embarrassingly', 'similar', 'show', 'show', 'pick', 'random', 'Smallville-ite', 'give', 'him/her', 'kryptonite-fueled', 'power', 'just', 'be', 'ironic', 'twist', 'personality', 'guy', 'who', 'angry', 'easily', 'Give', 'fire', 'bug-lover', 'Turn', 'bug', 'wait', 'had', 'fire', 'guy', 'how', 'cold', 'guy', 'then', 'bee', 'girl', 'rogues', 'gallery', 'pathetic', 'going', 'comic-booky', 'could', 'be', 'fun', 'plain', 'stupid.Now', 'let', 'talk', 'characters', 'Chloe', 'worst', 'limp', 'attempt', 'Willow', 'character', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'matter', 'what', 'situation', 'matter', 'how', 'little', 'evidence', 'around', 'Chloe', 'instantly', 'correct', 'implausible', 'solution', 'Hmm', 'girl', 'MUST', 'be', 'controlling', 'killer', 'bees', 'emitting', 'queen', 'bee', 'scent', 'direct', 'mental', 'channel', 'script', 'Then', 'Pete', 'character', 'so', 'insubstantial', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'name', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'Continuing', 'Buffy', 'analogy', 'Xander', 'character', 'Xander', 'was', 'actually', 'witty', 'charming', 'Pete', 'barely', 'noticeable', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'Clark', 'best', 'friend', ""n't"", 'actually', 'do', 'anything', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'rest', 'characters', 'Ma', 'Pa', 'Kent', 'Lionel', 'Luthor', 'are', 'played', 'stereotypes', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'unoriginal', 'predictable.But', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'aspect', 'show', 'complete', 'lack', 'suspense', 'episode', 'always', 'know', 'who', 'bad', 'guy', 'very', 'beginning', 'Given', 'Clark', 'invulnerable', 'main', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'likely', 'die', 'know', 'how', 'show', 'going', 'unfold', 'end', 'Add', 'cliched', 'dialog', 'plot', 'just', 'compare', 'super-teen', 'show', 'Buffy', 'succeeded', 'domain', 'characters', 'were', 'strong', 'dialog', 'was', 'clever', 'plots', 'had', 'surprising', 'twists', 'even', 'when', 'vampire', 'parts', 'got', 'dumb.There', 'occasional', 'flash', 'brilliance', 'episode', 'rogue', 'cop', 'who', 'Clark', 'thankfully', 'kryptonite-poisoning', 'sight', 'when', 'Cassandra', 'Lex', 'hand', 'see', 'future', 'Other', 'rarities', 'show', 'barely', 'watchable', 'even', 'painfully', 'bad', 'sometimes', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'being', 'just', 'enough', 'take', 'mind', 'treadmill', 'stick', ""'m"", 'curious', 'watch', 'Clark', 'Lex', 'mature']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)
601939,A1R6RKKE44AYA8,B00005JLKB,"Diane K. Miller ""diinIN""","[1, 1]","I was a really, really hard sell on this series, mainly because I didn't start at the beginning, which is critical.  I'll spare you the dull details of how I came to purchase season 1.  Suffice it to say that I now publicly retract every bad thing I ever said about Smallville.This is an excellent show that appeals to all ages, both genders, comics fans or not, Superman fans or not.  The series builds on itself, and each subsequent season gets still better.  The first season is mostly freak-of-the-week, as Clark discovers his super-abilities and tries to understand them.The Pilot is super and had me not only engaged, but loving the characters.  I still find Lana a bit annoying at times, but have sort of grown used to her.  My entire family, ages 8 to 53, half girls, half guys, love this show.The casting of Tom Welling, Michael Rosenbaum, Allison Mack, Annette O'Toole, John Schneider, and John Glover, was genius.  They are all absolutely perfect in their roles.  Season 1 doesn't showcase Tom's acting talent as well as future seasons when Clark's journey grows in complexity, but he is still exceptional, very likeable, believeable, and gorgeous, much like the young Christopher Reeve.  He was a new actor when Smallville started, so it's neat to see him grow and improve over the years, the most notable leap made between the second and third seasons.Feature film quality special effects and stunts abound.  The manipulation of time during action is truly fascinating, wherein time is slowed almost to a standstill so that we can actually see what Clark is doing (as he moves so fast!).  I love watching Clark and bullets, either standing there taking them, catching them in his hand, or dodging them in slow motion.All in all, GREAT show.  Some episodes are stronger than others, but that's typical.  My favorites were the Pilot, Hourglass, Nicodemus, Stray, Tempest.  Least favorites were Hothead, Cool, Craving, Shimmer, Crush.  Even in the weaker episodes, though, the B-story makes it worth watching.  The Luthors always keep you guessing!Special features in this set are okay.  The tour of Smallville is too brief.  The Storyboard was interesting, but by far the best of the extras are commentaries on the Pilot, Metamorphosis, etc.  Those are truly fascinating, and everyone is so honest about what worked and what didn't, and the problems they ran into during shooting.  Some of these are tricky to access, tho.  You have to go down to the tiny arrow next to ""main menu"" and select it.I was going to give season 1 four stars, just to allow for an even better season 2 and 3, but it deserves five.  Future seasons deserve ten!",5,Awesome!!,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,2647,"['was', 'really', 'really', 'hard', 'sell', 'series', 'mainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'beginning', 'critical', ""'ll"", 'spare', 'dull', 'details', 'how', 'came', 'purchase', 'season', '1', 'Suffice', 'say', 'now', 'publicly', 'retract', 'bad', 'thing', 'ever', 'said', 'Smallville.This', 'excellent', 'show', 'appeals', 'ages', 'genders', 'comics', 'fans', 'not', 'Superman', 'fans', 'not', 'series', 'subsequent', 'season', 'still', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'mostly', 'freak-of-the-week', 'Clark', 'super-abilities', 'tries', 'understand', 'them.The', 'Pilot', 'super', 'had', 'not', 'only', 'engaged', 'loving', 'characters', 'still', 'find', 'Lana', 'bit', 'annoying', 'times', 'have', 'sort', 'grown', 'used', 'entire', 'family', '8', '53', 'half', 'girls', 'half', 'guys', 'love', 'show.The', 'casting', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'John', 'Schneider', 'John', 'Glover', 'was', 'genius', 'are', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'roles', 'Season', '1', ""n't"", 'showcase', 'Tom', 'acting', 'talent', 'as', 'well', 'future', 'seasons', 'when', 'Clark', 'journey', 'complexity', 'still', 'exceptional', 'very', 'likeable', 'believeable', 'gorgeous', 'much', 'young', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'was', 'new', 'actor', 'when', 'Smallville', 'started', 'neat', 'see', 'grow', 'improve', 'years', 'most', 'notable', 'leap', 'made', 'second', 'third', 'seasons.Feature', 'film', 'quality', 'special', 'effects', 'stunts', 'abound', 'manipulation', 'time', 'action', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'wherein', 'time', 'slowed', 'almost', 'standstill', 'so', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'what', 'Clark', 'doing', 'so', 'fast', 'love', 'watching', 'Clark', 'bullets', 'either', 'standing', 'there', 'taking', 'catching', 'hand', 'dodging', 'slow', 'motion.All', 'GREAT', 'show', 'episodes', 'are', 'stronger', 'others', 'typical', 'favorites', 'were', 'Pilot', 'Hourglass', 'Nicodemus', 'Stray', 'Tempest', 'Least', 'favorites', 'were', 'Hothead', 'Cool', 'Craving', 'Shimmer', 'Crush', 'Even', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'though', 'B-story', 'worth', 'watching', 'Luthors', 'always', 'keep', 'guessing', 'Special', 'features', 'set', 'are', 'okay', 'tour', 'Smallville', 'too', 'brief', 'Storyboard', 'was', 'interesting', 'far', 'best', 'extras', 'are', 'commentaries', 'Pilot', 'Metamorphosis', 'etc', 'are', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'everyone', 'so', 'honest', 'what', 'worked', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'problems', 'ran', 'shooting', 'are', 'tricky', 'access', 'tho', 'have', 'go', 'down', 'tiny', 'arrow', 'main', 'menu', 'select', 'it.I', 'was', 'going', 'give', 'season', '1', 'four', 'stars', 'just', 'allow', 'even', 'better', 'season', '2', '3', 'five', 'Future', 'seasons', 'deserve', 'ten']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

""The Good die young,but pricks live...","[4, 4]","I got hooked on this show by accident.I always heard about it but never made an attempt to watch it because it was on the WB and most of the shows on this network are similar to one another in terms of good looking people fighting over who wants to get the cute girl or guy. I also thought Smallville was about a dude controlling or interacting with aliens (like X-files or something)...then the more episodes I watched the more it started to make sense. I was a fan!I had to get the box set because I had to watch everything from the beginning. Every single episode is EXCITING! None boring. Tom Welling does this role great...I actually feel for his character Clark when his powers become a little overwhelming to handle at times and he wishes he was normal and didn't have to hide. Clark is every woman's dream with the sensitivity issue...he says all the right things...the woman are already feeling him on that...why can't they find him a girl though to hold him over til Lois Lane? We all know that he doesn't end up with Lana in the end plus The Cat and mouse thing with Lana gets a bit tired at times. I can bet if the series goes to Metropolis when Clark is all grown up....guess who will play Lois? Kristin Kreuk.Everyone does great in this series especially Michael Rosenbaum as Lex, I actually felt sorry for Lex at times because he too has tons of issues, half the time he is lonely and drinking some sort of alchohol beverage or driving around in the latest sports car...filling this void, you almost wish he never turns into THE Lex Luthor...but just like Anaken SkyWalker in Star Wars episode II who turns into the Evil Darth Vader Lex changes too...sadly...his character is very likable, most of the times he means well but it just ends up looking bad for him no matter what he does.I haven't seen season 2 yet (awaiting it's arrival to purchase it) The season one price was a bit high but definitely worth it though, bonuses, interactivity, it's great, recommended.

Marvin,"[3, 3]","That's how fast I became addicted to the series that I, amongst others, referred to as &quot;Superman's Creek&quot; upon first learning of the premise. I jumped in midway through season 2 at the urging of a roommate. Now I'm visiting the episodes from season 1, complete with all the original music in tact (commercial-free!) and loving every minute of it.The first season falls victim to what we'd call the &quot;monster-of-the-week&quot; syndrome, in which most episodes contain a villain who used to be a normal Smallville citizen until they were exposed to some form of kryptonite. Once exposed, the villains either go mad or want some sort of revenge and it's up to Clark to save the day.So there's the formula... but about a third of the way into the season, we come to realize there's so much more going on. For instance, Lex Luthor's obsession with figuring out what makes Clark so special begins to eat away at him. Clark just can't figure out what he really wants from Lana... or Chloe. And he keeps discovering new abilities.Even beginning with the first episode (and look at the cover of this DVD, for crying out loud!), the creators surround us with so much symbolism regarding what the Superman legend will become (although it will likely never go too far in this series), tantalizing us with lines like this one from Lex to Clark: &quot;Our friendship will be the stuff of legend.&quot; Just watch the Pilot episode and that will reel you in. It got me hooked and I'm plowing through this whole season in only a couple of days.I'm a diehard fan of &quot;The West Wing&quot; and even I have to admit this is fun and entertaining television that's more than just something the kiddies can enjoy.

601950,A3GGUBZMTQD1B9,B00005JLKB,Esther Schindler,"[2, 4]","I had caught the occasional episode of Smallville on TV, but in no particular order. The premise was immediately obvious -- Clark Kent in his small Kansas hometown, learning to cope with his powers and to function in society. It was clear, even from my few experiences with the show, that there was a story arc, so I picked up Season One. If nothing else, I figured, seeing the pilot episode would help me figure out everyone's background. (Which it did.)Smallville could have been lame. But it succeeds admirably well because the writers constructed characters who are thoroughly believeable even though they're put in comic-book predicaments. Admittedly, this season does have a propensity towards ""monster of the week,"" but it manages to overcome it, because of very ""human"" reactions. Clark's parents are frightened about the powers their kid has, and how he can possibly create a normal life (""He woke up _floating?!_ Well, I guess he'll have to get over his fear of heights""); they also get annoyed with Clark for being an ordinary teenager who doesn't do his chores.And, as one appreciated bit of versimilitude, the Kent Farm really operates like a farm, with daily concerns about keeping the tractor going or putting in fence line. (My husband grew up on a farm, so Kent's ability to knock in fence posts, with the ease you'd insert a bamboo skewer into a melon ball, was extremely funny. And that's just in the background of a scene.)It's told with a wonderful sense of humor, sometimes very subtle; an irritated female classmate, encountering Clark's cluelessness about what girls want, blurts at him, ""Men are from Mars and women are from Venus, Clark, but you're from some planet in a galaxy I haven't even heard of!"" Yet the humor doesn't get in the way of the story; we laugh because, in some ways, we know more about Clark Kent than do the Smallville residents.The key, though, is the inclusion of a young Lex Luthor who is adamently Clark's friend; since we know what happens to Clark in the long run, the compelling mystery is how Lex evolves from the guy with good intentions to Superman's arch-enemy.Overall, it's a fun series to watch.

I'm also a charmed fan, but after Shannen Doherty's departure, Charmed went downhill, (and since Veronica Mars didn't come till later that can't be included in the golden era) so I was excited about this show and was very pleased with it.Its easy to see why ""Smallville"" drew in the largest audience ever on The WB when it premiered. (I'm not sure if it still holds that title but I know that it did at one time)It tells the story of Clark Kent aka Superman, during his teenage years, living in the small town of Smallville, and shows how he struggles between trying to fit in at his high school (he's not exactly part of the in crowd), deal with his super powers and making sure no one finds out his secret, and of course theres his long time crush Lana Lang (played by the beautiful Kristin Kreuk) who he longs to be with. You also get to see a friendship form between him and his future enemy, Lex Luthor (played by Michael Rosenbaum) after Clark saves his life.This show does a good job of being a teen drama mixed with sci-fi (although during the first few seasons, its more of a teen drama. It gets more sci-fi during the later seasons I believe)The only problem with this season is that it seems that during every episode, some random kid is gaining superhuman abilities after being infected by a meteor rock. But beside that....great show! The best part about this season is the season finale, which will leave you dying to see season 2! (which is another great season by the way)Unfortunately, I can't give you a review on the entire series overall so far, as I  am not up-to-date with the current seasons. But its not due to lack of interest! I watched up until mid-season 3, and then I ended up missing a few episodes and before I knew it, I had missed the rest of season 3, along with the entirety of season 4!

Perkins ""wide reader""","[0, 0]","SPOILERS FOLLOW""Smallville"" is the first superhero science fiction show I actually have become enthralled with to the point of watching every week.  A creative spin on the world-famous ""Superman"" legend, it expertly mixes fantastical elements with realistic coming-of-age themes and storylines and boasts one of the finest young casts on television.In this first season of the CW series, the principal cast is comprised of Tom Welling as Clark Kent, Kristin Kreuk as Lana Lang, Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor, Sam Jones III as Pete Ross, Allison Mack as Chloe Sullivan, Eric Johnson as Whitney Fordman, and John Schneider as well as Annette O'Toole as Johnathan and Martha Kent, respectively.  Additionally, a very important recurring guest star this season is John Glover as Lionel Luthor, Lex's cold, controlling and monstrous father.  Throughout this season the cast works well together, with the possible exception of Eric Johnson whose character struggles to find an interesting season-long storyline.Michael Rosenbaum's Lex Luthor is worth the price of admission by itself.  From an acting standpoint, Mr. Rosenbaum's performance would be worthy of an Oscar if he were on the big screen. Additionally, the writing for Lex is exceptional, as in the ""Smallville"" storyline he is a best friend to Clark Kent, but doomed to become his blood enemy.  The creativity and emotional complexity surrounding the Luthors and their relationships to themselves and others gives this series suspense for many years as well as an angle of storytelling maturity.The pilot episode of this series is one of the best pilots I've ever seen of any show.  It introduces characters, and sets events in motion on a huge scale with a catastrophic occurrence which reverberates for the rest of the series.  The special effects are cinematic, and announce that the show intends to divorce itself from the well-meaning cheese that doomed previous attempts to bring superheroes to the small screen.""Smallville"" displays maturity, class, and truly compelling storyines.

601965,A3D5UHUD1CMTXG,B00005JLKB,"Jacki ""Jack Mueller""","[10, 32]","I will admit, I was excited when I first learned this series was coming out. Then I saw how the characters of Superman and Clark Kent have been butchered within this show. SMALLVILLE is in fact just another teen drama taken off the shelves but given exceptionally bad Superman aspects. The show is about a teenager struggling to find his place in the world and working way too hard to fit in with his peers. Except this teenager happens to be Clark Kent, the future Man Of Steel, living in the small farm town of Smallville. The show started well, with the arrival of Ka-El and being taken in by the Kent family. Then it jumps forward in time to a high school freshman Clark Kent all mopey about how he doesn't fit in with the popular crowd, and how he just can't get his dream girl Lana Lang. So the pathetic Clark goes off to a bridge where he ponders about life and mamages to get hit by the crazed driver Lex Luthor. This is where the series finally unfolds. Clark being the super human that he is, is unhurt as Lex's car takes them both off the bridge to the water below, and Clark performs a daring rescue of Lex who is uncouncious from the car crash. Later, Lex feels indebted to Clark and also very curious to how Clark was able to save him. So Lex forms a friendship with Clark but also launches an invesitgation on him. From then on the series consists of Lex's research and delicate friendship with Clark, people with their own agendas to disrupt life in Smallville (some have been infected with traces of Kryptonite rocks), and everyone dealing with personal struggles within their lives. These personal conflicts are what takes up most of the show, Clark performs some heroic action towards the beginning and end of each episode but most of the episodes jus deal with characters' sucky lives. I may have been into this if the characters had been more Superman oriented. Clark should have been this major nerd with glasses, incredibly shy, but very interested in the ways of the world and politics. This interest would have led Clark to his future career as a reporter. Being a nerd is Clark's way of hiding the fact that he is Superman and has powers that hardly anyone else around him does. That's part of the fun of Superman; seeing Clark act like this major geek in order to throw people off in discovering his true identity of being Superman. Throughout the season, he should have gained his powers, learned how to use them, and then Clark should have gotten a call from his father Jar-El. This call would have led Clark to realize what good he could do as the individual that he is, and thus he would have become Superboy. EXCEPT, THIS NEVER HAPPENS. Clark is just another teenager struggling to be popular and not a nerd at all who is interested in the world and politics. Clark in this show is way too cool and I'm sure that appeals to the female fans out there. But if he is ever turned into Superman, the story won't be as believable as before in having people not making the connection of Clark being Superman. So for most of this year Clark is running around, trying to hide his true personality from others so that he can fit in, but still helps people without their knowledge because they happen to be distracted by something else at the time. SMALLVILLE is a great dissapointment in its regards to Superman or Superboy for that matter, because it takes forever for those aspects to arise. Most of the show is just a teen drama with Superman and Superboy characters in it. I am so glad that there is now another Superman film out that shows how Superman characters should truly be used.",1,"Just Another Teen Drama, But With Poorly Used Superman Traits",1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,3612,"['will', 'admit', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'first', 'learned', 'series', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'Then', 'saw', 'how', 'characters', 'Superman', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'have', 'been', 'butchered', 'show', 'SMALLVILLE', 'fact', 'just', 'teen', 'drama', 'taken', 'off', 'shelves', 'given', 'exceptionally', 'bad', 'Superman', 'aspects', 'show', 'teenager', 'struggling', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'working', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'fit', 'peers', 'teenager', 'be', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'future', 'Man', 'Steel', 'living', 'small', 'farm', 'town', 'Smallville', 'show', 'started', 'well', 'arrival', 'Ka-El', 'being', 'taken', 'Kent', 'family', 'Then', 'forward', 'time', 'high', 'school', 'freshman', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'mopey', 'how', ""n't"", 'fit', 'popular', 'crowd', 'how', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'dream', 'girl', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'pathetic', 'Clark', 'off', 'bridge', 'where', 'life', 'mamages', 'get', 'hit', 'crazed', 'driver', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'where', 'series', 'finally', 'unfolds', 'Clark', 'being', 'super', 'human', 'unhurt', 'Lex', 'car', 'bridge', 'water', 'Clark', 'daring', 'rescue', 'Lex', 'who', 'uncouncious', 'car', 'crash', 'Later', 'Lex', 'feels', 'indebted', 'Clark', 'also', 'very', 'curious', 'how', 'Clark', 'was', 'able', 'save', 'So', 'Lex', 'forms', 'friendship', 'Clark', 'also', 'invesitgation', 'then', 'series', 'Lex', 'research', 'delicate', 'friendship', 'Clark', 'people', 'own', 'agendas', 'disrupt', 'life', 'Smallville', 'have', 'been', 'infected', 'traces', 'Kryptonite', 'rocks', 'everyone', 'dealing', 'personal', 'struggles', 'lives', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'are', 'what', 'up', 'most', 'show', 'Clark', 'heroic', 'action', 'beginning', 'end', 'episode', 'most', 'episodes', 'jus', 'deal', 'characters', 'sucky', 'lives', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'Superman', 'oriented', 'Clark', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'nerd', 'glasses', 'incredibly', 'shy', 'very', 'interested', 'ways', 'world', 'politics', 'interest', 'would', 'have', 'led', 'Clark', 'future', 'career', 'reporter', 'Being', 'nerd', 'Clark', 'way', 'hiding', 'fact', 'Superman', 'powers', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'else', 'part', 'fun', 'Superman', 'seeing', 'Clark', 'act', 'major', 'geek', 'order', 'throw', 'people', 'off', 'discovering', 'true', 'identity', 'being', 'Superman', 'season', 'should', 'have', 'gained', 'powers', 'learned', 'how', 'use', 'then', 'Clark', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'call', 'father', 'Jar-El', 'call', 'would', 'have', 'led', 'Clark', 'realize', 'what', 'good', 'could', 'do', 'individual', 'thus', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'Superboy', 'EXCEPT', 'THIS', 'NEVER', 'HAPPENS', 'Clark', 'just', 'teenager', 'struggling', 'be', 'popular', 'not', 'nerd', 'who', 'interested', 'world', 'politics', 'Clark', 'show', 'way', 'too', 'cool', ""'m"", 'sure', 'appeals', 'female', 'out', 'there', 'ever', 'turned', 'Superman', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'believable', 'before', 'having', 'people', 'not', 'making', 'connection', 'Clark', 'being', 'Superman', 'So', 'most', 'year', 'Clark', 'running', 'around', 'trying', 'hide', 'true', 'personality', 'others', 'so', 'can', 'fit', 'still', 'people', 'knowledge', 'happen', 'be', 'distracted', 'something', 'else', 'time', 'SMALLVILLE', 'great', 'dissapointment', 'regards', 'Superman', 'Superboy', 'matter', 'forever', 'aspects', 'arise', 'Most', 'show', 'just', 'teen', 'drama', 'Superman', 'Superboy', 'characters', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'now', 'Superman', 'film', 'out', 'how', 'Superman', 'characters', 'should', 'truly', 'be', 'used']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

601968,A2D0CM6EQ9N59J,B00005JLKB,Jake Phillips,"[2, 2]","I have been a fan of Superman all my life, through many continuities and adaptations.  Is this the BEST version of the legend?  No.  At least not when judged by the standards of the first season.With a new show, it often takes a while to find the right footing with which to portray your characters abd situations to their best effect.  The second and third seasons of 'Smallville' show a quantum leap in improvement as regards quality and content.  Nevertheless, this box set is a great jumping on point for those unfamiliar with the show, or with the Superman mythos in general.  As a new beginning, this show has taken the story of the world's first (and greatest) superhero to a new level.  The special effects are stellar, and the cast works hard to make the outrageous premises believable.That being said, the one gripe about Season One in general is that there are too many episodes which rely on the premise of Kryptonite (in the show at this point, they say 'meteor rocks') affecting a Smallville teen and causing a new supervillain.  But these problems have been ironed out in subsequent seasons, so that the initial premise now seems kind of . . . sweet, in a nostalgic sort of way.All things considered, since this is the BEST version of the Superman mythos ever committed to live action )when based on what comes next), and any quibbles with the minor drawbacks are . . . minor.

601972,A2CEX7784M8YSU,B00005JLKB,Jeffery Bauman,"[8, 8]","Show: The premise of Smallville is relatively simple: what was it like for Clark Kent as a teenager? This may not have taken up much space in the Superman comics, but the producers dicided to build a whole show about it.  And what a show it is!  Here, Clark Kent is played to perfection by Tom Welling.  I am by no means a comic book fan, or a huge Superman fan for that matter, but Welling is the only person who could play Kent in this show.  Rounding out the cast are Kristin Kreuk as Lana Lang, Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor, Sam Jones III as Pete, Allison Mach as Chloe, Annette O'Toole as Martha Kent, John Shneider as John Kent, and John Glover as Lionel Luthor.  The entire cast is excellent, especially Welling, Kreuk, Rosenbaum, Mach, and Glover.  Season One has Clark Kent learning to deal with his abilities and his strong feelings for Lana Lang.  Season One has many ""Freak of the Week"" episodes which wisely took a back seat in Season Two.  The characters are nicely developed throughout the season.  Episodes that particiularily stand out are the ""Pilot,"" ""Metamorphosis,"" ""Stray,"" and the absolutely stunning Season Finale ""Tempest.""  I highly recommend this show to any Superman fan, as well as anyone who likes great TV.  Highly recommended!  5/5Video: Warner Home Video brings ""Smallville"" to DVD in a very nice 1.78:1 Widescreen version.  This is really good picture quality for a TV Show, but with the fantastic job Warner Brothers is doing with the ""Friends"" sets, what can you expect?  In fact, the quality on the ""Smallville"" sets are even better!  Colors are great, the picture is nice and sharp.  Sometimes it can look a tad dark, but thats the way the show is shot, and is not a fault of the transfer.  Very good.  (4.5/5)Audio: Every bit as good as the picture quality.  While only presented in Dolby 2.0 Stereo, the sound mix here is pretty comparable to most Dolby 5.1 tracks, and in some cases, even better.  The surrounds are put to nice use during the action scenes, while the rest of the mix remains pretty front-heavy.  The music score, and the various pop songs used throughout the show sound very nice here.  While a full Dolby 5.1 mix would have been appreciated, this mix suits the show perfectly fine.  (4.5/5)Extras:  There are producer commentaries on the episodes ""Pilot"" and ""Metamorphosis."" Thses are very good commentaries, and they seem to be enjoying themselves, and obviously like the show.  Other extras include deleted scenes from the ""Pilot"" and ""Metamorphosis,"" an interactive tour of ""Smallville,"" a TV Promo Spot, and DVD Rom access to Chloe's ""Wall of Weird.""  (3/5)Overall: An excellent show gets excellent DVD treatment.  Nice audio and video quality, and some great extras to boot.  Highly Recommended.

His powers include (at this point) the ability torun fast, have super strength, and x-ray vision. Every episode except for about 3 or 4 clark must stop a kryptonite freak, that is a person whose dna has been altered by the meteor rocks. It is up to Clark to stop them all. At school his friends are Chloe, the school reporter, Pete Ross, Clark's best friends, and Lana, the girl who he loves but can't be w/ because of Whitney, Lana's boyfriend. Also in an ironic twist of fate, Lex Luthor, his future nemesis, is friends w/ him in this show. The writing is excellent and the special effects are awesome. Some special effects shots include the meteor rocks raining over smallville, Clark getting hit by lightning, super-fast mode(a rip off of the matrix) which still works well in this show, and a tornado in the seasons jaw-dropping finale.  episode are in order: pilot, metamorphosis, hothead, x-ray, cool, hourglass, craving, jitters, rogue, shimmer, hug, leech, kinetic, zero, nicodemus, stray, reaper, drone, crush, obscura, and tempest.

601976,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B00005JLKB,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[1, 1]","With Buffy no longer on that leaves 24 and SmallVille as my 2 favorite shows. Smallville is a coming of age Superman series with Clarke Kent dealing with being a teenager and with being from another planet with super powers. Clarke slowly starts to get  powers such as x-ray vision in this season and in season 2 learns he can shoot lazors from his eyes. It's nice to see how Superman learns to deal with having powers. I mean in the movies he acts as if he had powers all along.In Smallville you get too see that when his powers come to him slowly they actually scare him. That's actually better done than the scenes where Peter Parker learns that he can shhot webs in Spiderman. In that it's taken as a joke and his powers don't scare him as much as they should when we first learns of them. When Clarke learns he can shoot lazers he carefully masters how to control it so he doesn't hurt someone on accident.Anyway Smallville's only problem is that it can have these silly X-Files like villains that you know are no match for Clarke. It's still satisfying and cool to see how he takes care of each one of them though. The show can also be annoying how Clarke and Lana have a Dawson and Joey type relationship. Clarke likes her, she likes him but she has a b/f that stands between them being together. Most episodes end with them bonding and looking into each others eyes and smiling at each other ""makes you want to scream out, Kiss already!"".The show is still 10 times better than any of the other Superman shows that have come along in recent years. It's more serious and darker than Louis and Clarke. It's sorta like Superman meets Buffy meets the X-Files meets Dawsons Creek lol. What makes it like Buffy is that he has sort of his own Scooby gang as well. He has his wanna be jock friend Pete and his conspiracy believer friend Cloey who also has a huge crush on him. Surprisingly enough Clarke is also good friends with Lex Luther (Michael Rosembalm from Urban Legend).Michael Rosembalm who had  short lived WB shows before Smallville is excellent as Lex Luther.  Hell he might actually be better than Gene Hackman. He plays Lex as he slowly becomes bad. You see the good...yet bad in him as he struggles to not be like his dad in each episode. Tom Welling is also awesom as Clarke Kent. What makes this show so good is that the performances are as interesting and engaging as the plots of each episodes. If you aren't into this show and think it's too mushy for you, I think you need to watch it to see what you have been missing. It has it's mushy romantic side to it to attract women viewers but it also has enough action and intrigue to attract male viewers as well. So what are you waiting for ? Check out this show and then maybe you might consider buying these dvd's....I know I'm getting them.",4,Excellent Show,1056672000,"06 27, 2003",2003,2810,"['Buffy', 'no', 'longer', '24', 'SmallVille', '2', 'favorite', 'shows', 'Smallville', 'coming', 'age', 'Superman', 'series', 'Clarke', 'Kent', 'dealing', 'being', 'teenager', 'being', 'planet', 'super', 'powers', 'Clarke', 'slowly', 'get', 'powers', 'such', 'x-ray', 'vision', 'season', 'season', '2', 'can', 'shoot', 'lazors', 'eyes', 'nice', 'see', 'how', 'Superman', 'deal', 'having', 'powers', 'mean', 'movies', 'had', 'powers', 'along.In', 'Smallville', 'get', 'too', 'see', 'when', 'powers', 'come', 'slowly', 'actually', 'scare', 'actually', 'better', 'done', 'scenes', 'where', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'can', 'shhot', 'webs', 'Spiderman', 'taken', 'joke', 'powers', 'do', ""n't"", 'scare', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'when', 'first', 'When', 'Clarke', 'can', 'shoot', 'lazers', 'carefully', 'how', 'control', 'so', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'someone', 'accident.Anyway', 'Smallville', 'only', 'problem', 'can', 'have', 'silly', 'X-Files', 'villains', 'know', 'are', 'match', 'Clarke', 'still', 'satisfying', 'cool', 'see', 'how', 'care', 'one', 'show', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'annoying', 'how', 'Clarke', 'Lana', 'have', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'type', 'relationship', 'Clarke', 'b/f', 'being', 'together', 'Most', 'episodes', 'end', 'bonding', 'looking', 'others', 'eyes', 'smiling', 'other', 'want', 'scream', 'out', 'Kiss', 'already', '.The', 'show', 'still', '10', 'times', 'better', 'other', 'Superman', 'have', 'come', 'recent', 'years', 'more', 'serious', 'darker', 'Louis', 'Clarke', 'sorta', 'Superman', 'meets', 'Buffy', 'X-Files', 'meets', 'Dawsons', 'Creek', 'lol', 'What', 'Buffy', 'sort', 'own', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'as', 'well', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'jock', 'friend', 'Pete', 'conspiracy', 'believer', 'friend', 'Cloey', 'who', 'also', 'huge', 'crush', 'Surprisingly', 'enough', 'Clarke', 'also', 'good', 'friends', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'Michael', 'Rosembalm', 'Urban', 'Legend', '.Michael', 'Rosembalm', 'who', 'had', 'short', 'lived', 'WB', 'shows', 'Smallville', 'excellent', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'Hell', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'better', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Lex', 'becomes', 'bad', 'see', 'good', 'yet', 'bad', 'not', 'be', 'dad', 'episode', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'also', 'awesom', 'Clarke', 'Kent', 'What', 'show', 'so', 'good', 'performances', 'are', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'plots', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'show', 'think', 'too', 'mushy', 'think', 'need', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'missing', 'mushy', 'romantic', 'side', 'attract', 'women', 'viewers', 'also', 'enough', 'action', 'intrigue', 'attract', 'male', 'viewers', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'are', 'waiting', 'Check', 'show', 'then', 'maybe', 'might', 'consider', 'buying', 'dvd', '.I', 'know', ""'m"", 'getting']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

However, if you see Superman as more of a mythic hero in the classic sense, then this is a very well done coming of age story.

Thanks, Tiger Blossom...you REALLY did me a favor with this one.WOW, this is good...I probably haven't been this stoked over a TV drama series since &quot;Miami Vice&quot; back in the day.  And &quot;Smallville&quot; is already proving to have superior staying power than that brief cross-section of '80's kitsch.  Superior production, drop-dead casting, and a hearty respect to the original idea of Superman that you just didn't see in &quot;Lois &amp; Clark&quot;...but still they find time to wedge the tongue FIRMLY in cheek with foreshadowing innuendo that never fails to bring a smile to this viewer's face.  And this from a guy who leaned more toward Batman than the Big Blue Schoolboy as I was growing up (I had issues, okay?).I won't go into the basics of the plot, chances are you already understand the adolescent Clark Kent growing into the blue suit &amp; red cape as he grows from boy to young man being equally awkward transitions to make.  The first season, being primarily an introduction not just to the characters but to the city for whom the series is named, DOES lend itself to predictability and in fact the quality of the shows has improved since then (no small feat; the first season was in itself extremely entertaining).  And true, the WB could possibly have been a tad more generous with special features (at LEAST offering a 5:1 sound mix option...the special effects would seem even larger than life over a home theatre system)...but I'll happily take what they've presented here and eagerly await the following seasons to be released (note to Warner Bros:  Tiger Blossom's birthday is on June 22nd...can ya help a brother out?)Bottom line:  If you enjoy good television writing (which is SO rare these days), or if you EVER enjoyed any aspect of any of the innumerable interpretations of the Superman mythos, you owe it to yourself to give the show a chance.

It is a superhero science fiction/ romance much like Spider-Man 2 was. Smallville has fantastic movie quality production values and spectacular effects. The writers overcome the challenge of creating villains powerful enough to threaten Clark.

However, no one really knows the story of Clark Kent, especially his teenage years when his powers began to develop.  That's where Smallville comes in.By the time you read this review you will no doubt have read countless others telling you the main plot of the series, so I won't waste my time on that.  I will tell you that if you are a fan of Superman or are somewhat intrigued with the concept of Superman and would like to learn where he got his powers and what shaped him into the hero we all know, then Smallville is the series for you.The first season of the series was for the most part strong in it's presentation, there were some weak moments and the freak of the week thing kind of got old, especially since both Angel and Buffy had done it to death already.  However annoying the freak of the week was, it was a necessary annoyance to propel the first season along.  Here's a kid that's to become Superman, he starts out the season with super-strength, super-speed, and is mostly invulnerable, he needs someone to fight that will pose somewhat of a challenge, therefore freaks are needed.The episodes for the most part were formulaic this first season, with this basic premise:  introduce freak, explain freak, have freak cause some form of trouble, Clark overcomes freak and learns some kind of lesson to apply to his future heroic life.  There were some episodes that broke this formula, the episode ""Stray"" was one, where the freak of the week is not a villain but rather becomes somewhat of a younger brother to Clark.  Another focuses on a rogue Metropolis cop that tries to use Clark and his abilities for his own gain, under the guise of trying to rid the world of evil.  The last episode that broke these rules was ""Vortex"" which also served as the cliffhanger/season finale.  This episode was an intense episode that presented Clark with the challenge of facing a non-human enemy, tornadoes.The acting in the series was great and has advanced in every season.  Tom Welling seems shy at first but becomes comfortable with his role as Clark Kent and is totally believable after a few episodes.  Michael Rosenbaum and John Glover as the Luthor's are awesome together on screen as they go round-and-round with each other.  The special effects are great, and also have improved with each season.Overall an excellent beginning to a saga we all know and to a top-notch series.

601985,A1E1FGV9V1WQ6A,B00005JLKB,Justin Playfair,"[11, 12]","First of all, I don't watch much television, partly due to a lack of time but also because there just hasn't been anything that appeals to me. I read Superman comics as a kid and the character still appeals to me, but the pointless ""Lois and Clark"" series left a bad taste in my mouth for Superman-related programs. I was vaguely aware of ""Smallville"", but it wasn't until I found myself with nothing else to do but watch television that I finally saw an episode, and I'm glad I did. It was entering its fourth season by then, but suffice it to say that I now watch it every evening in syndication.So why do I like it? Well, its strengths are the acting, the production values, and (here's the big shock for me) the writing. The characters are likable and believable; they're not the stock characters that populate pretty much every television program, but are interesting and sympathetic. That's particularly impressive when you're starting with such well-known (and potentially one-dimensional) characters as Clark Kent and Lex Luthor. I also have really enjoyed the stories and I think the idea of having Kryptonite endow people with different powers and ability was a very clever one. On the other hand, that theme is also perhaps the series' biggest weakness, as the ""Kryptonite-mutated bad guy (or girl)"" concept has been overused a bit.The bottom line in my opinion is this: the people who created this series ""get it"" with respect to what makes Superman a great hero. It isn't his powers; it's his character. It's not what he can do that makes him great but who he is as a person. That's why the series works: because this show isn't really about a strange visitor from another planet doing super feats, but about how Clark Kent grows up to be a super man.",5,What more television ought to be,1098835200,"10 27, 2004",2004,1764,"['First', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'much', 'television', 'partly', 'due', 'lack', 'time', 'also', 'just', ""n't"", 'been', 'anything', 'appeals', 'read', 'Superman', 'comics', 'kid', 'character', 'still', 'appeals', 'pointless', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'series', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'Superman-related', 'programs', 'was', 'vaguely', 'aware', 'Smallville', 'was', ""n't"", 'found', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'watch', 'television', 'finally', 'saw', 'episode', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'was', 'entering', 'fourth', 'season', 'then', 'say', 'now', 'watch', 'evening', 'syndication.So', 'why', 'do', 'Well', 'strengths', 'are', 'acting', 'production', 'values', 'here', 'big', 'shock', 'writing', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'believable', ""'re"", 'not', 'stock', 'characters', 'populate', 'pretty', 'much', 'television', 'program', 'are', 'interesting', 'sympathetic', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'when', ""'re"", 'starting', 'such', 'well-known', 'potentially', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'also', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'stories', 'think', 'idea', 'having', 'Kryptonite', 'endow', 'people', 'different', 'powers', 'ability', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'one', 'other', 'hand', 'theme', 'also', 'perhaps', 'series', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'Kryptonite-mutated', 'bad', 'guy', 'girl', 'concept', 'been', 'overused', 'bit.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'opinion', 'people', 'who', 'created', 'series', 'get', 'respect', 'what', 'Superman', 'great', 'hero', ""n't"", 'powers', 'character', 'not', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'great', 'who', 'person', 'why', 'series', 'show', ""n't"", 'really', 'strange', 'visitor', 'planet', 'doing', 'super', 'feats', 'how', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'up', 'be', 'super', 'man']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

I had the Superman action figure, the red ""S"" shirts, and even the Superman movie poster. Now, fourteen years later, I'm 18 and hooked again with Superman mania. The WB's successful show, ""Smallville"" has re-discovered my childhood all over again (or also called the Peter-Pan syndrome).This inventive show marks the dawn of probably the best show ever on The WB or even TV history. The idea of backtracking to Clark Kent's (soon to be hero) teenager days is the best prequel idea ever. Not even George Lucas himself could be as creative as ""Smallville's"" creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, as they show the relationship between Lex Luthor (soon to be villain) and Clark Kent. At first, I didn't see it as realistic, but as I gave it a try, it really seems more possible then any of the Superman spin offs that failed over the years.As seen with the original 1978 film, most of us know how Clark Kent got here and who he was destined to be. But the film never explores the emotions Kent's goes through during the process of learning all of his ""abilities"". Nor does it explain how Lex Luthor got as evil as he did. The comics never explore these aspects either, so a TV show was only destined to be made. After years of wondering, fans now get the full story of Superman.Twelve years ago, a meteor shower collides to a small town called Smallville, Kansas. During the meteor shower that destroyed or impacted the lives in this small town, Jonathan (John Schneider) and Martha Kent (Annette O' Toole) finds a spaceship with a little boy in a cornfield, outside of Smallville. They fall in love and adopt him (as later, fans see Lex Luthor's dad is involved with the adoption). He grows up to be Clark Kent (Tom Welling).The show doesn't quite revolve around Kent though. We also get to see the subplots that involve Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) and his, dad Lionel Luthor (John Glover). Fans see a good side of Lex Luthor, which makes him, seem like a likeable guy. We see once in a while, the twitch of evilness in Lex's eye. We also see the inner changing parallel of jealously between Luthor and Kent (Clark over Lex's money, Lex over Clark's family).""Smallville"" is best compared to ""X-Files"" because of the different kinds of ""weird stuff"" that goes on in this small town (which the meteorites from the meteor shower are to blamed 99.9 percent of the time). While this goes on, Kent is usually the one that saves the people from the edge of the seat scenarios that takes place with each episode.The show has many levels, which makes it a perfect Superman prequel and aside from Superman, makes an effort to be as separate from the Superman saga as possible. So it also has that drama/soap opera appeal too. I admire the soap opera angle with the love triangle of Clark, Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) and Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk.)The show stays true with the film series (a little side note: Annette O'Toole played Lana Lang in ""Superman 3"") and the comic books. It's neat watching the show's writers pull clever angles and characters from both, so fans will be glorified. (It's rumored the character Chloe Sullivan is cousins with Lois Lane!) Each episode goes closer in depth with the Superman origins.The writers have two aspects to work with: the movie series and the comic books. They found a way to connect those aspects, while pulling something new and fresh, that's more then the writers of ""Enterprise"" could do! Even though we won't see these characters in Smallville forever, I vote to see this series last as long as ""7TH Heaven.""

601994,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B00005JLKB,"kone ""kone""","[5, 5]","I have loved the Superman story since I was a knee high.  I recall watching the original black and white Superman series on TV in the late 1950's and early 1960's.  Superman became my hero and I even donned long underwear and with a bath towel for a cape, I transformed myself into Superboy.  I bought all the comic books and by the time I was 12 I knew all there was to know about Superboy and Superman.  Then I ""outgrew"" such childhood things and entered my troubled teens, leaving Superboy behind.Discovering ""Smallville"" has rekindled my long dormant interest in things Super.  I never would have believed that a ""modern"" tv series could be faithful to the original intent of the comic book Superboy, but Smallville does this and more.  The plots are wonderfully entertaining and engaging!  Sure, some are a bit campy, but that's what critics said about Star Trek (the original series, when it first debuted too and look what happened to that series!The first season of ""Smallville"" introduces us to Clark Kent, his Kansas family, and the central characters in young Clark's life, such as Lana Lang, Lex Luthor, and others.  Clark is a handsome young man in the mould of Chris Reeves, and he can act too, boy can he act!  In fact, the acting is the strength of this series, as all the central characters show an amazing ability to make the supernatural life of a superboy seem so real and interesting.  I got hooked after watching the pilot episode where the baby Kal-el from Krypton plunges to earth in a spacecraft and is discovered by his future earth parents, Ma and Pa Kent.  The scripts are true to the original story of Superboy, and they trasport me back in time 45 years to my childhood, where once again I can enjoy the many adventures of Superboy, although this time without the long underwear and cape.If you have any doubts about buying this series, put them aside, for Smallville is no small-time show.  This is the real thing, and if you want to learn or relive the story of Superboy, this is the best place you could start.  So sit back and get hooked on a series the whole family can enjoy.I have just one question: if Superboy is invulnerable to all physical harm, how did the Kents ever give him a haircut?Most highly recommended.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig, Superman fan since I was knee high",5,I Have a New Favorite Series!,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,2309,"['have', 'loved', 'Superman', 'story', 'was', 'knee', 'high', 'recall', 'watching', 'original', 'black', 'white', 'Superman', 'series', 'TV', 'late', '1950', 'early', '1960', 'Superman', 'became', 'hero', 'even', 'donned', 'long', 'underwear', 'bath', 'towel', 'cape', 'transformed', 'Superboy', 'bought', 'comic', 'books', 'time', 'was', '12', 'knew', 'was', 'know', 'Superboy', 'Superman', 'Then', 'outgrew', 'such', 'childhood', 'things', 'entered', 'troubled', 'teens', 'leaving', 'Superboy', 'behind.Discovering', 'Smallville', 'rekindled', 'long', 'dormant', 'interest', 'things', 'Super', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'believed', 'modern', 'tv', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'faithful', 'original', 'intent', 'comic', 'book', 'Superboy', 'Smallville', 'more', 'plots', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'Sure', 'are', 'bit', 'campy', 'what', 'critics', 'said', 'Star', 'Trek', 'original', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'debuted', 'too', 'look', 'what', 'happened', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'Smallville', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Kansas', 'family', 'central', 'characters', 'young', 'Clark', 'life', 'such', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'others', 'Clark', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'mould', 'Chris', 'Reeves', 'can', 'act', 'too', 'boy', 'can', 'act', 'fact', 'acting', 'strength', 'series', 'central', 'characters', 'show', 'amazing', 'ability', 'make', 'supernatural', 'life', 'superboy', 'seem', 'so', 'real', 'interesting', 'got', 'hooked', 'watching', 'pilot', 'episode', 'where', 'baby', 'Kal-el', 'Krypton', 'plunges', 'earth', 'spacecraft', 'discovered', 'future', 'earth', 'parents', 'Ma', 'Pa', 'Kent', 'scripts', 'are', 'true', 'original', 'story', 'Superboy', 'trasport', 'back', 'time', '45', 'years', 'childhood', 'where', 'once', 'again', 'can', 'enjoy', 'many', 'adventures', 'Superboy', 'time', 'long', 'underwear', 'cape.If', 'have', 'doubts', 'buying', 'series', 'put', 'aside', 'Smallville', 'small-time', 'show', 'real', 'thing', 'want', 'learn', 'relive', 'story', 'Superboy', 'best', 'place', 'could', 'start', 'So', 'sit', 'back', 'get', 'hooked', 'series', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy.I', 'have', 'just', 'one', 'question', 'Superboy', 'invulnerable', 'physical', 'harm', 'how', 'did', 'Kents', 'ever', 'give', 'haircut', 'Most', 'highly', 'recommended.Jim', 'Konedog', 'Koenig', 'Superman', 'fan', 'was', 'knee', 'high']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)
601995,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLKB,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[28, 31]","Maybe it is that Superman is truly indestructible or that the Man of Steel, who was picked this year as one of the Top 10 American pop culture icons, is so respected that not even Hollywood would dare tug on his cape, because ""Smallville"" is another successful small screen version of the strange visitor from another planet.  Of course, the great irony is that this time around there is no cape to tug on because this television series is about Clark Kent, years before he put on the suit with the big red ""S,"" when he was still in high school, his powers were just starting to kick in, and the girl in his life with the double L name was Lana Lang.Keep in mind that when Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel created the Man of Steel in 1939 there was no Superboy until 1949, when he began part of the futuristic Legion of Super-Heroes.  All we knew about the early days is that just before the doomed planet Krypton exploded to fragments, a scientist placed his infant son within an experimental rocket ship, launching it toward earth.  When the vessel reached our planet, the child was found by an elderly couple, the Kents.  They adopted the super tyke and with love and guidance shaped the boy's future.  As he grew older Clark Kent learned to hurdle skyscrapers, leap an eighth of a mile, raise tremendous weights, run faster than a streamline train, and that nothing less than a bursting shell could penetrate his skin.  When his foster parents passed away, Clark decided he must turn his titanic strength into channels that would benefit mankind.The key part of ""Smallville"" is that creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar go back to the simple beginning, with young Clark (Tom Welling) growing up on the Kent farm with Martha (Annette O'Toole) and Jonathan (John Schneider).  From the ""Superboy"" comic books the series borrows the characters of girl next-door Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) and best buddy Pete Ross (Sam Jones III).  But in addition to covering the basics, Gough and Millar come up with a key triad of additions to the original Smallville mythos.First, they add young Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) to the mix, knowing that he and Superman are fated to be (im)mortal enemies, but that for the present he and Clark are friends (after Clark saves Lex's life in a car accident that should have killed them both).  The key thing is that they truly are friends and that ""Smallville"" is as much about how Lex would become a super villain as it is about how Clark would become a super hero.  Throw into the mix Daddy Dearest in the form of Lionel Luthor (John Glover), and Lex would have already pulled all of his hair out if it were not for what happened that fateful day in Smallville.Second, is the brilliant reconceptualization of Superman's arrival on earth where the small spacecraft shows up in the middle of a shower of glowing green meteors that are all that remains of the planet Krypton.  As much as the little boy in that spaceship, those meteors change Smallville forever, turning a little girl into an orphans and a young boy bald, and the small Kansas town into the self proclaimed meteor capital of the world.  More importantly, those little green rocks will have continue to have an impact as they cause a series of mutations with which young Clark will have to contend.  This also accounts for the great in-joke that Clark always becomes a bumbling idiot around Lana because she wears a locket made of kryptonite.Third, there is the multi-purpose character of Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack).  The driving force of the Smallville High School student newspaper her ""Wall of the Weird"" documents all the strange things that have happened around Smallville since the meteor shower, making her the show's resident mistress of exposition.  But she is also the tragic figure who longs for Clark the way he casts puppy dog glances at Lana, creating a nice example of teenage love triangle pathos.Overall, Miller and Gough had created an extremely solid premise for their series, which creates multi-dynamics for all of the plotlines.  The first season (2001) is book ended by some great special effects, with the devastating arrival of the meteors in the pilot and the three twisters becoming one in the thrilling cliffhanger finale.  My only serious complaint is that Schneider's Jonathan Kent has too much of an angry edge, which takes away from his font of parental wisdom.  Martha really needs to mellow him out so that he cuts Clark some slack.  I understand that Jonathan is motivated by fears and concerns about his son, but I always liked the gentle influence personified by Glenn Ford in the first Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" film.  Turning adolescent traumas into mutant monsters of the week is a hit and miss proposition, but that was true of the first season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as well, and look at how well that series turned out.Yes, we can also throw into the mix that Clark and Lana are played by a couple of cute young actors.  Welling is not too serious as the kid who is going to grow up to be the hero who stands for truth, justice, and the American way, and I was going to say Kruek was the WB's new Katie Holmes except after her soft-core Lana scene in the school swimming pool goes way beyond the world's biggest collection of midriff revealing tops.  But the bottom line here is that either the Clark-Lana or the Clark-Lex would be enough to make this a good show and ""Smallville"" has both of them and a lot more, including the brilliant metaphor of the scarecrow immortalized in the DVD collection's cover shot.",5,"""Superboy"" comics were never half as good as ""Smallville""",1067299200,"10 28, 2003",2003,5562,"['Maybe', 'Superman', 'truly',

From his first appearance on Action Comics in 1938 to George Reeves's live action series of the 50s to the stunning Richard Donnor films of the 70s and 80s to the romantic action comedy of Lois and Clark in the 90s as well as the animated adventures, Superman has been successful in all media. The story and journey of the Last Son of Krypton has become an American classic and no superhero has been more successful than the Man of Steel. In the fall of 2001, The WB went on to debut the latest and probably most refreshing tale of Superman yet with ""Smallville"". Created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, ""Smallville"" would tell the journey of a young Clark Kent before he would put on his signature tights. With an intriguing premise, a stunning looking cast and a good budget to back up its storylines, ""Smallville"" premiered with the highest ratings the small network has ever had, a whopping 8.4 million viewers tuned in to see the pilot episode simply titled, ""Pilot."" ""Pilot"" is such an impressive introduction to the series that still remains strong `til this day. The ingenious idea that not just has baby Kal-El arrive on Earth in his spaceship, but with a meteor shower caused by the destruction of Krypton was the perfect set-up for the rest of the series.The cast all fit their roles and do a fine job when interacting for the first time. A then 24 year-old Tom Welling is very convincing as the whiny, moody, mild mannered 15 year-old Clark Kent. You really feel bad as he just wants to be normal, yet his extraordinary abilities make it even harder for him to be a teenager. John Schneider (Dukes of Hazard) and Annette 'O Toole (Lana Lang in Superman III, ironically) are just perfect as Clark's loving adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent. Sam Jones III is fine as Clark's energetic best friend, Pete Ross and Allison Mack is lovely as Chloe Sullivan (who besides Lionel Luthor is the only other character not from the mythos, but an original character). Then you have a very innocent yet cute Kristin Kruek as Lana Lang, Clark's high school sweetheart and Eric Johnson as Whitney Fordman, Lana's boyfriend. The last of the cast is the excellent John Glover as Lionel Luthor and Michael Rosenbaum as a young Lex Luthor. Probably the other impressive aspect of the first episode is how Clark and Lex first meet, which involves Lex running Clark over on the road and Clark saving his life. After that traumatic event, both men become friends! Wait, the future Superman and Lex Luthor friends? That premise alone already made ""Smallville"" much more unique than any other Superman adaption before it.Season 1 is mostly about Clark dealing with the discovery that his an alien as well as developing into Smallville's unlikely hero when meteor freaks (humans infected by the meteor rocks of the meteor showers) begin terrorizing the town with their unique powers. ""Metamorphosis"" sees Clark battling a boy with insect abilities, ""Hothead"" features a football coach with fire manipulation, and ""Cool"" has a meteor freak with a Mr. Freeze-type ability that sets his sights on Chloe. The meteor freak of the week type storylines are both the season's strength and weakest. Some are excellent (""X-Ray"", which Clark discovers his X-Ray vision) while some are plain sub-par (""Reaper"", a mess of an episode where a meteor freak can literally turn people into ash.) But while Season 1 has its jittery and not so pleasant moments, the character development and growing relationship easily shine through. Episodes like ""Leech"" already shows exactly why Clark will grow up to be the greatest hero of all time, ""Zero"" is a nice introduction into the dark world of Lex's past and ""Rogue"" tests the bond of the Kent family when a renegade cop sets his sights on Clark. Other memorable from this series' freshman year is ""Jitters"" with Tony Todd's unforgettable guest appearance, the mysterious invisible killer storyline of ""Shimmer"", and the suspense driven finale, ""Tempest"" with tension filled cliffhangers which one that sees Lana's life hanging in the balance when tornados hit Smallville.It's funny looking back at the first season, seeing as how everything was so innocent and grounded back then. Clark and Lana's growing friendship with hidden signs of romance was great to watch, who would have thought it would have been dragged out for the next 6 seasons. Also, Clark and Lex's friendship was at its prime with no signs of animosity but genuine brotherly love for one another. Season 1 is a solid first season with great introduction, memorable character development and a lot of signs of promise for the rest of the series.Season Rating: 8/10Video and Audio review-All 21 episodes in the first season are shown in widescreen which fits the series.  The episodes look nice with vibrant colors and the audio is just fine, although nothing special.Video and Audio: 7/10Extras:The first season box set has some pretty average; you have 2 commentaries for ""Pilot"" and ""Metamorphosis"" with the show creators which are just okay.  The Storyboard extra is decent but unnecessary look as making the ""Pilot"" episode. The Interactive Smallville extra is pretty boring and the 2 WB spots are a cool look back at the old WB promos.Extras Rating: 5/10Overall Score: 7.5/10",4,Before He Became Legend: Smallville's

601998,A2YWEG35UMPBJ3,B00005JLKB,"L. Harris ""skytag""","[11, 38]","Having been a big fan of all things Superman for nearly 40 years, I was thrilled at the prospect of a new Superman show, even if it was about his life before he moved to Metropolis and became Superman. But this show was such a disappointment on so many levels. Where to begin? Well, in no particular order:- It strays too much from the Superman story. All that supernatural stuff in the cave is contrary to what we've known about Superman ever since he was created, and Kryptonite has never affected people from Earth in any way, but on this show it felt like every week there was a new psycho super villian resulting from Kryptonite exposure. Clark's character in Smallville is inconsistent with the Clark we've known for the past 60 years.- It's too negative. Superman/Clark Kent has always been a positive, upbeat, easy-going person. His parents are good people. In Smallville Clark is frustrated, angry, confused, and at odds with his friends half the time. What's fun about that? His dad is childish, petty, and mean in his treatment of Lex Luthor, as if he doesn't have the maturity to be civil to Lex just because he doesn't like Lionel. What a jerk. How much better it would have been and truer to Jonathan's character for him to be extra nice to Lex because his father. Apparently the writers of Smallville just love writing petty, mean-spirited characters, because this show abounds with them.- There's the severe lack of creativity. Too many Kryptonite bad guys*. Too many misunderstandings between Clark and his friends (how creative does a writer have to be to write about high school kids being jerks becaue they got their feelings hurt over a misunderstanding?). Too much time spent pining for Lana. Too little variety in general in the story lines.I have three kids, all in their teens when the first season of this show started, and not one of them liked it. I tried to like it, but I gave up watching toward the end of the second season. It just wasn't fun to watch.  I think the problem with Smallville is that the writers didn't really make it a show about Superman as a teenager. They made it a show about an unhappy teenager with super powers and threw in some elements of the Superman story, along with other stuff which is not at all a part of the Superman story. Bummer.*In an audio commentary in a later season they pretty much admit they had so many Kryptonite bad guys because they couldn't come up with enough bad guys without it.

602002,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00005JLKB,magellan,"[3, 5]","As a boy growing up in the 60s, I was an avid fan and reader of Superman comics. I didn't catch this series when it first aired, but I found it at my local movie rental store and my curiosity led me to rent it. I've just finished volumes one through four of the six in the first season and was so impressed I wanted to make a quick comment.So far I haven't enjoyed a TV science-fiction series this much since the original Star Trek. The series's strengths are the engaging story ideas and the strong cast, all of whom strike just the right notes in their roles, and are really superb. Superboy is great and also Lana Lang. But the real show stealer is Michael Rosenbaum, who is terrific as Lex.But Lex isn't the evil mastermind of the comics out to get Superman. Here he's a good guy and Superboy's friend, although sometimes he does resort to certain morally questionable expedients to accomplish his goals, but he truly wants to protect Superboy and his friends. There is no doubt he has a dark side, but it's mostly kept in check and when it does come out, it's usually to fight an even more evil bad guy. In other words, to fight evil, you need an even sneakier and more ruthless bad guy who's still on the side of good. :-) It's a brilliant concept and one of the ideas that really make the show stand out from the herd. One other great idea is the Kryptonite meteorite fragments also creating strange abilities and talents in different people, aside from its property of being toxic to Superboy.I've spent so much time on Lex that I don't want to overlook the other characters, but as I just wanted to write a brief review, I'll just say they're all really great in their roles too, especially Tom Welling and Kristen Kreuk.Toward the end of the season, it looks like Clark is finally going to get together with Lana, but then the story takes a turn and it he ends up getting together with Chloe instead, and the first season ends on that note. So I guess I'll find out how that turns out in the second season. So far I think this is great series and the best thing in a sci-fi show to come along in a long time. These first few DVDs of season one have made me a convert and I look forward to renting the other seasons.",5,Great series,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,2225,"['boy', 'growing', 'up', '60s', 'was', 'avid', 'fan', 'reader', 'Superman', 'comics', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'found', 'local', 'movie', 'rental', 'store', 'curiosity', 'led', 'rent', ""'ve"", 'just', 'finished', 'volumes', 'one', 'four', 'six', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'wanted', 'make', 'quick', 'comment.So', 'far', 'have', ""n't"", 'enjoyed', 'TV', 'science-fiction', 'series', 'much', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'strengths', 'are', 'engaging', 'story', 'ideas', 'strong', 'cast', 'whom', 'strike', 'just', 'right', 'notes', 'roles', 'are', 'really', 'superb', 'Superboy', 'great', 'also', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'real', 'show', 'stealer', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'who', 'terrific', 'Lex.But', 'Lex', ""n't"", 'evil', 'mastermind', 'comics', 'out', 'get', 'Superman', 'Here', 'good', 'guy', 'Superboy', 'friend', 'sometimes', 'resort', 'certain', 'morally', 'questionable', 'expedients', 'accomplish', 'goals', 'truly', 'protect', 'Superboy', 'friends', 'doubt', 'dark', 'side', 'mostly', 'kept', 'check', 'when', 'come', 'out', 'usually', 'fight', 'even', 'more', 'evil', 'bad', 'guy', 'other', 'words', 'fight', 'evil', 'need', 'even', 'sneakier', 'more', 'ruthless', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'still', 'side', 'good', 'brilliant', 'concept', 'one', 'ideas', 'really', 'make', 'show', 'stand', 'out', 'herd', 'One', 'other', 'great', 'idea', 'Kryptonite', 'meteorite', 'fragments', 'also', 'creating', 'strange', 'abilities', 'talents', 'different', 'people', 'aside', 'property', 'being', 'toxic', 'Superboy.I', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'Lex', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'overlook', 'other', 'characters', 'just', 'wanted', 'write', 'brief', 'review', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', ""'re"", 'really', 'great', 'roles', 'too', 'especially', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk.Toward', 'end', 'season', 'Clark', 'finally', 'going', 'get', 'together', 'Lana', 'then', 'story', 'turn', 'up', 'getting', 'together', 'Chloe', 'instead', 'first', 'season', 'note', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'how', 'out', 'second', 'season', 'far', 'think', 'great', 'series', 'best', 'thing', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'come', 'along', 'long', 'time', 'first', 'few', 'DVDs', 'season', 'one', 'have', 'made', 'convert', 'look', 'forward', 'renting', 'other', 'seasons']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

And it is surprisingly addictive.Set in modern times, we join Clark Kent (Tom Welling) is Smallville, Kansas.  He's a teenager attending high school.  And he's just starting to develop the powers he'll use to save the world as Superman.  His best friends in school are Pete Ross (Sam Jones III) and news hound Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack).  And he is not so secretly in love with girl next door (okay, a mile away.  It is the country) Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk).  Unfortunately, she's already dating quarterback Whitney Fordman (Eric Johnson).In addition to being a farming town, Smallville has a LuthorCorp fertilizer plant.  Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) has just been sent there by his father Lionel (recurring actor John Glover).  And when Lex hits Clark but both survive, the two form a friendship, much to the dismay of Clark's parents, Martha and Jonathan (Annette O'Toole and John Schneider).But weird things keep happening in Smallville.  Seems that the meteor shower in which Clark arrived 13 years ago left behind all kinds of rocks.  And coming in contact with them gives people strange powers.  With Chloe's help, Clark has to keep trying to save the day while forging a friendship with Lana.  All this leads up to a season ending cliffhanger sure to have you coming back for more.I'm just now watching this series.  The first few episodes were actually rather forgettable.  I was already getting tired of the formula of the show.  But then around episode 8 or 9, the show began to find itself.  True, it often still focused on the freak of the week, but they started telling the story in different ways and involving more of the cast.  I especially got hooked on Whitney's storyline in the second half of the season.And you can't forget the special effects.  Even when I was bored with the story, I was still impressed with just how great they looked, especially for a weekly television series.  The acting was a little weak near the beginning, but it got better as it progressed as well.What really got me the most was watching the friendships of the characters.  It breaks my heart that Lex and Clark grow up (okay, so Lex is already an adult) to be enemies.And the show constantly throws in ironic lines about who Clark will become.

Lex's foreshadowing of his eventual villainy is intriguing. Clark and Lana's relationship is young love at its strongest and weakest moments. Chloe and Clark's friendship is a passionate and heart-rendering tale. SMALLVILLE is the show that mixes not only action, suspense, and drama, but romance, foreshdaowing, and mystery. All this, plus BRILLIANT writing, exceptional acting, and incredibly moving music make this my favorite show on tv. The first season is a great introduction tot he show. Clark and Lex begin as friends. Clark pines after Lana. What Clark doesn't see is that Chloe and Lana are both for him, the perfect combination of journalistic drive and sensitivity. The episodes that are the real highlights of this season, in my opinion, are the following:""Pilot""-An intro to the characters and a retelling of the classic tale of Superman.""Cool""-A relatable and heart-rendering episode. The episode that got me absolutely hooked!!""Zero""-A foreshadowing, thrilling episode about Lex's past.

602007,AAHNPLJ1L109Y,B00005JLKB,Matt M.,"[103, 119]","NOTE: This review was actually written about a Canadian DVD release of the first two episodes of the series which were edited into a feature-length movie.I was mighty skeptical when I first heard about Smallville. Mainly, I was disappointed that Warner Bros. Television decided to go with this instead of the proposed Bruce Wayne series about his world travels before returning to Gotham to become Batman. Aside from that, it looked like (as one of my friends dubbed it) ""Dawson's Krypton."" To further complicate things, I discovered that Lex Luthor was to be one of the main characters. Basically, it seemed like it would never work. Boy, was I wrong.I began watching the series in the summer, right after the season finale, when WB started rerunning episodes.  I was immediately hooked. (I preordered the Canadian import DVD of the first two episodes right after it was announced.) What struck me immediately about the series was its attention to character development. While the series is mainly episodic, there are usually several subplots that continue from week to week that advances the characters' relationships to one another. The ongoing story of Clark and Lana is especially poignant and heartbreaking due to the fact those who are familiar with Superman lore understand that, even if the two of them get together, their romance won't last. (Thankfully, Tom Welling and Kristen Kreuk have wonderful chemistry and are fully capable actors.)The main plots are the show's weakest points. I would imagine it's difficult to come up with a way for Clark Kent to be a superhero from week to week, thus they gave themselves an equivalent to Buffy's hellmouth, the kryptonite rocks. The villains can get fairly ridiculous, such as the bugboy in the second episode (included on the DVD). Fortunately, the writers understand how to turn this into a strength. Rather than focusing entirely on the villain, we get to see how the villain or the situation he/she/it causes affects the characters. (A good example comes later in the series when Clark's powers transfer to another boy and he gets to live a normal life for a short period of time.)As to my iffiness about the inclusion of Luthor, once again, my initial reaction was completely off-base. The makers of the show have managed to make Lex Luthor the most interesting character in the series, thanks in no small part to the outstanding performance of Michael Rosenbaum. I've never seen the character given such depth in a non-comics medium and it is absolutely a breath of fresh air. Watching his transition from hero to anti-hero [to villain?] will be fascinating (providing it happens in the course of the series).Of course this review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the terrific work of John Schneider and Annette O'Toole as Clark's adoptive parents. It is important to understand why Clark decides to use his powers to help those in need. The Kents are honest, hard-working people who have instilled Clark with a strong sense of right and wrong, and Schneider and O'Toole pull it off brilliantly.As the title of my review suggests, I only have one major misgiving about the show, and that's the use of Remy Zero's ""Save Me"" as the theme song. I normally like watching the opening credits of shows, but since I don't care for the song, I usually fast forward through this one.  It's a shame, since Mark Snow composed a great theme for it. (It can be found on the DVD's menu screen and during the end credits.)I hope WBHV decides to start releasing entire seasons on DVD here in the U.S. soon. I'm certain this is a series that will get better over time. (The addition of Jeph Loeb to the writing staff points to this. To those unfamiliar with the name, check out his and Tim Sale's Superman For All Seasons.)",4,Great Series!

Annette O'Toole (Superman III) and John Schnider (The Dukes of Hazzard) add a nice touch as Ma and Pa Kent. Though Pa needed to lighten up considerably in the first season. An issue that was adequately addressed in the early second season.The supporting cast, especially Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor, deserve the lion's share of the credit here as well. Without a strong supporting cast, this show could easily fall on it's face.While the first season tended to lean a bit heavily on the ""Kryptonite-created Villian of the Week"", it's a fun ride.

While one would think that these things would go hand in hand,there seems to be a division among some people. There are those hard core Lois and Clark fans who feel for some reason that Smallville isn't doing the legend justice.Both series deal with Clark Kent at different stages of his life and while they couldn't be any less similar in their presentation yet, when you piece them together in sequence (and that will take several years with Smallville), you can see the logical progession from Clark Kent as a teenager growing up to the man he'll become in Metropolis.You can see Tom Welling morphing into Dean Cain on some level (though seeing John Schneider and Annette O'Toole as Eddie Jones and K. Callan may be a bit of a stretch), but it brings us a fresh and different looks at Clark Kent's roots...before the flights and the tights. It throws the whole Superboy thing out, which is appreciated (and staying consistent with the Lois And Clark series, where his mother makes his costume).Clark Kent tries, in some way, to be as normal as possible under the circumstances (you know, super strength, super speed, the whole xray vision thing), but it's not easy, especially when he has to hide his ""secret"" from the world and deal with the trials and tribulations of being a teenager at the same time.Season one introduces us to a much different take on his relationship with Lex Luthor (they are friends...destined to become enemies), his friend Pete Ross (who never was black in the comics) and offers insight into his feelings for Lana Lang who was, prior to Lois Lane, the big love of his life.The color on the series is breathtaking and the stories excellent. To see the development of Clark Kent as a heroic figure just as confused by his emerging powers as anyone and the development of Lex Luthor into the maniacal villan he will one day be, we are seeing a true grassroots version of this story.One scene in particular sums this up for me. At the end of ""Crush"" when everyone is at the funeral of Whitney's dad, the glances between Lana and Clark and Chloe to both set against the backdrop of the rain and the cemetery takes my breath away each time I see it. A scene where no words are spoken out loud, yet thousands resonate in the wind.A brilliant first season which only taps the surface of what is to come down the road.Lois and Clark fans rejoice...the legend is alive.",5,Why Do Lois And Clark Fans Hate Smallville?,1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,2445,"['am', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'fan', 'am', 'also', 'Smallville', 'fan', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'things', 'would', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'be', 'division', 'people', 'are', 'hard', 'core', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'fans', 'who', 'feel', 'reason', 'Smallville', ""n't"", 'doing', 'legend', 'justice.Both', 'series', 'deal', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'different', 'stages', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'less', 'similar', 'presentation', 'yet', 'when', 'piece', 'together', 'sequence', 'will', 'take', 'several', 'years', 'Smallville', 'can', 'see', 'logical', 'progession', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'teenager', 'growing', 'up', 'man', ""'ll"", 'become', 'Metropolis.You', 'can', 'see', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'morphing', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'level', 'seeing', 'John', 'Schneider', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'Eddie', 'Jones', 'K.', 'Callan', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'stretch', 'fresh', 'different', 'looks', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'roots', 'flights', 'tights', 'whole', 'Superboy', 'thing', 'out', 'appreciated', 'staying', 'consistent', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'series', 'where', 'mother', 'costume', '.Clark', 'Kent', 'tries', 'way', 'be', 'as', 'normal', 'possible', 'circumstances', 'know', 'super', 'strength', 'super', 'speed', 'whole', 'xray', 'vision', 'thing', 'not', 'easy', 'especially', 'when', 'hide', 'secret', 'world', 'deal', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'being', 'teenager', 'same', 'time.Season', 'one', 'much', 'different', 'take', 'relationship', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'are', 'friends', 'destined', 'become', 'enemies', 'friend', 'Pete', 'Ross', 'who', 'never', 'was', 'black', 'comics', 'insight', 'feelings', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'who', 'was', 'prior', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'big', 'love', 'life.The', 'color', 'series', 'breathtaking', 'stories', 'excellent', 'see', 'development', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'heroic', 'figure', 'just', 'confused', 'emerging', 'powers', 'anyone', 'development', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'maniacal', 'villan', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'are', 'seeing', 'true', 'grassroots', 'version', 'story.One', 'scene', 'particular', 'sums', 'up', 'end', 'Crush', 'when', 'everyone', 'funeral', 'Whitney', 'dad', 'glances', 'Lana', 'Clark', 'Chloe', 'set', 'backdrop', 'rain', 'cemetery', 'breath', 'away', 'time', 'see', 'scene', 'where', 'words', 'are', 'spoken', 'out', 'loud', 'yet', 'thousands', 'resonate', 'wind.A', 'brilliant', 'first', 'season', 'only', 'surface', 'what', 'come', 'down', 'road.Lois', 'Clark', 'fans', 'rejoice', 'legend', 'alive']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

602015,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00005JLKB,Mitch Weaver,"[6, 7]","Before I watched ""Smallville"", I assumed there was no way for a WB made show to compete with the other aspects of the Superman franchise. Doubting ""Smallville"" was probably one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. In my opinion, it is the best show on TV right now, and one of the best that I have ever seen. The reason the show works, is because it takes an interesting look at the legend of Superman. You bare witness to the human side of the character - Clark Kent, growing up as a teenager in Smallville Kansas. Clark must adjust to his different powers, the relationship between Lex Luthor and Clark develops, and you see the classic romance between Clark and Lana Lang, who are destined to be just friends. Watching the two fight their feelings for each other, really provides for a great romance side to the show.The show works for both Superman loyalists like myself, as well as fans who are new to the character in general. For the loyalists, the show sticks very close to the original story, and the special effects are outstanding when it comes to Clark's powers. For the people who are just starting out with Smallville, it still works, because it offers fresh young actors, entertaining episodes, and current hit music. Tom Welling is absolutely outstanding as Clark Kent, not only because he looks the part, but also because he acts with such intense emotion. You come to feel for what the character is going through. Kristin Kreuk is great as Lana Lang and is absolutely gorgeous! I am very happy that the producers are sticking a Lois Lane type character into the picture with Allison Mack who plays Chloe - the skeptical and news hungry editor of the school paper. John Glover hits the bullseye with his portrayal of Lionel Luther. Michael Rosenbaum is a good actor but I am still torn on his role of Lex Luthor. It is frustrating to see Lex and Clark as friends, when the two are destined to be enemies. The most surprising performances come from Anette O Toole and John Schneider who play Clark's parents. They both do an extremely good job and really capture the true essence of John and Martha Kent.Smallville remains basically flawless in my eyes, and gets better every single week. The actors, entertaining episodes, and great music really make it a treat to watch.

602016,A2VEB9Z1W5DD4C,B00005JLKB,M. Newton,"[1, 1]","Are you interested in a place where you can relax and enjoy seeing a budding superhero, an evil arch enemy in the making, various adventures each week, and an interesting cast of friends and family to provide an extra bit of drama?  If so, Smallville is for you.The basic premise is that we are watching Clark Kent (Superman) before he actually became Superman.  In fact, he's just a freshman in high school (even though he and his friends look like they're in their 20s) and he doesn't even fully understand what his powers are and how he can utilize them.  I should also mention that the series is set in the modern day (around 2001 or so), which keeps it current.The creators of the series did a great job of creating this world, which has several key features.  Here's the key features in order of importance to the show.1)  Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor.  This is the most fascinating part of the show.  Michael Rosenbaum does an incredible job as the future evil mastermind.  He and the writers have created an incredibly complex individual who is very multifaceted.  You can see him struggle with his identity and he tries to find his true self. Clark and Lex have a very unique relationship that must be viewed to be appreciated.2) Clark's relationship with friends and family.  Clark goes through many of the typical teenage issues, but also has to protect his ""secret"" (his powers).  This affects his relationship with his parents and his friends.  He also struggles to build and maintain relationships with Lana Lang (the girl he's in love with) and Chloe (the girl who loves him).  While some of these story lines could have been lifted from 90210, the interesting characters and actors pull it all off.3)  Clark develops his powers.  Since Clark doesn't already know of his Superman abilities, we get to see him develop many of them as the season progresses.  The series has some pretty good special effects (for TV) and does a good job with things like his x-ray vision, for example.  For fans of Superman, this is a fun part of the show.4)  ""Freak of the Week"" guests.  Most episodes there are various ""freaks"", people who have been affected by the meteor rocks that came when Clark's ship arrived.  Most have unusual powers, and it is often up to Clark to stop them without letting anyone see him do it (he has a secret to keep, after all).  While this may seem to be the main event each week, I really consider this to be just filler.  The meat of the show is the first 3 items I mentioned.  Don't get me wrong, the various ""freaks"" have entertainment value, but they're just not the real focal point.All in all, this is a very good series that will have you constantly looking forward to the next episode.  I will tell you that season 2 gets even better, so you definitely have something else to look forward to.",5,Smallville: A fun place to escape,1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,2837,"['Are', 'interested', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'budding', 'superhero', 'evil', 'arch', 'enemy', 'making', 'various', 'adventures', 'week', 'interesting', 'cast', 'friends', 'family', 'provide', 'extra', 'bit', 'drama', 'so', 'Smallville', 'you.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'are', 'watching', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'actually', 'became', 'Superman', 'fact', 'just', 'freshman', 'high', 'school', 'even', 'friends', 'look', ""'re"", '20s', ""n't"", 'even', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'powers', 'are', 'how', 'can', 'utilize', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'series', 'set', 'modern', 'day', '2001', 'so', 'current.The', 'creators', 'series', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'world', 'several', 'key', 'features', 'Here', 'key', 'features', 'order', 'importance', 'show.1', 'Clark', 'relationship', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'most', 'fascinating', 'part', 'show', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'incredible', 'job', 'future', 'evil', 'mastermind', 'writers', 'have', 'created', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'individual', 'who', 'very', 'multifaceted', 'can', 'see', 'struggle', 'identity', 'find', 'true', 'self', 'Clark', 'Lex', 'have', 'very', 'unique', 'relationship', 'must', 'be', 'viewed', 'be', 'appreciated.2', 'Clark', 'relationship', 'friends', 'family', 'Clark', 'many', 'typical', 'teenage', 'issues', 'also', 'protect', 'secret', 'powers', 'relationship', 'parents', 'friends', 'also', 'build', 'maintain', 'relationships', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'girl', 'love', 'Chloe', 'girl', 'who', 'story', 'lines', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', '90210', 'interesting', 'characters', 'actors', 'pull', 'off.3', 'Clark', 'powers', 'Clark', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'Superman', 'abilities', 'get', 'see', 'develop', 'many', 'season', 'series', 'pretty', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'TV', 'good', 'job', 'things', 'x-ray', 'vision', 'example', 'fans', 'Superman', 'fun', 'part', 'show.4', 'Freak', 'Week', 'guests', 'Most', 'are', 'various', 'freaks', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'affected', 'meteor', 'came', 'when', 'Clark', 'ship', 'arrived', 'Most', 'have', 'unusual', 'powers', 'often', 'up', 'Clark', 'stop', 'letting', 'anyone', 'see', 'do', 'secret', 'keep', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'main', 'event', 'week', 'really', 'consider', 'be', 'just', 'filler', 'meat', 'show', 'first', '3', 'items', 'mentioned', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'various', 'freaks', 'have', 'entertainment', 'value', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'real', 'focal', 'point.All', 'very', 'good', 'series', 'will', 'have', 'constantly', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'episode', 'will', 'tell', 'season', '2', 'even', 'better', 'definitely', 'have', 'something', 'else', 'look', 'forward']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

But it all goes downhill when the WB stepped in and lavished it as a teeniebopper mellow drama with equally annoying and pretensious music from bands that will be hot one day and gone the next.  I actually kind of had high hopes for Smallville; the idea of presenting a teenage Clark Kent before he donned the cape and tights doesn't seem like a bad idea as I said before, but the way Smallville is presented is just plain lame.  Pretty boy Tom Welling doesn't display much range as the future hero, and the rest of the cast, aside from Michael Rosenbaum as future nemesis Lex Luthor, is flat.  There are a few good ideas floating around though: such as making the weekly villians have something to do with the meteor that brought Clark to Earth, Clark's awe as he discovers what he is capable of, and some solid guest stars (Tony Todd and X-Men's Shawn &quot;Iceman&quot; Ashmore), but other than that Smallville is another teeniebopper mellow drama with wasted potential.

602025,AW2GJONRCZKDS,B00005JLKB,Patrick J. Everett,"[0, 0]","Superman's protrayal in media other than comics (and in some cases comics as well) hasn't always been well-recieved or well made.  The first couple movies were all right, but after 12 movies, (or however many there were,) the well tends to run dry.  Cartoons and other media, such as games and CD's, have always seemed to be a mixed bag.  So doing a Superman show nowadays was always kinda risky.  It had to fit the tone of today's comics as well as appeal to fans who have been around for much longer.  Myself, being a fan since, well, birth, always held a certian sense of skepticisim and doubt when news of another series based on the Man of Steel reached my ears.  Especially when I heard that it was going on the WB, infamous for shows like &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; and the like.  The idea of an entire series based on his childhood (or more specifically, his high school years,) was a promising concept. I didn't want Clark Kent becoming another whiny teen.Thankfully, my doubts and fears quickly subsided as I watched the first season of &quot;Smallville,&quot; which is thankfully all gathered into this huge (6 discs?? ) set, which gets you all 21 episodes of the first season, including the pilot.  The show itself is a wonder to behold, filled with great performances and a wondeful setting, great dialogue, and the stories themslves continue to suprise and amaze.  As a Superman fan, it's great to see these cool little moments of a young Clark Kent having to adjust and develop his powers as they appear - as well as try to live a normal life as a teenager with a crush (Lana Lang, which again, fans will love,) and other typical teenager issues.Many characters from the comics (Clark, Lana, Jonathan and Martha Kent, as well as Lex Luthor, and Pete Ross, who is a fairly minor character in the comics), as well as some new ones, (Chloe - Clark's good friend and Whitney - Lana's boyfriend)combine into a well crafted and believeable cast.  Fans will snicker and adore all of the little ironic moments, all of which hint at what Clark will eventually become.  Little parts here and there, but there nonetheless.  The biggest one is the fact that Clark Kent and Lex Luthor... are best friends.  I couldn't count the number of times that there was a feeling of foreboding and destinic action in almost every scene with these two, my favorite was when Clark asked Lex how long he thought that they'd be friends.  Lex simply replied, &quot;Our friendship will be the stuff of legend.&quot;  He was certianly right.  Best writing ever, for this type of series, anyway.There are always going to be comparisons to other stuff like &quot;Creek,&quot; and it does kinda steer that way, but it can't be helped.  &quot;Creek&quot; was about a bunch of teens growing up and finding themselves.  &quot;Smallville&quot; is esentially about the same thing, only add superpowers and tons of special effects to the mix.  Another thing that's unique about this show, in terms of a superhero show, is that it is more about the alter ego than the hero.  It's a Superman show that's about Clark Kent.  Definately pick it up.  If you're a fan, you'll enjoy it immensly.  If you're just getting into it, it's a great way to start.",5,Superman fans Rejoice!,1074556800,"01 20, 2004",2004,3222,"['Superman', 'protrayal', 'media', 'other', 'comics', 'cases', 'comics', 'well', ""n't"", 'always', 'been', 'well-recieved', 'well', 'made', 'first', 'couple', 'movies', 'were', 'right', '12', 'movies', 'however', 'many', 'were', 'well', 'run', 'dry', 'Cartoons', 'other', 'media', 'such', 'games', 'CD', 'have', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'mixed', 'bag', 'So', 'doing', 'Superman', 'show', 'nowadays', 'was', 'always', 'kinda', 'risky', 'had', 'fit', 'tone', 'today', 'comics', 'as', 'well', 'appeal', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'longer', 'being', 'fan', 'well', 'birth', 'always', 'held', 'certian', 'sense', 'skepticisim', 'doubt', 'when', 'news', 'series', 'based', 'Man', 'Steel', 'reached', 'ears', 'Especially', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'WB', 'infamous', 'shows', 'quot', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'quot', 'like', 'idea', 'entire', 'series', 'based', 'childhood', 'more', 'specifically', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'was', 'promising', 'concept', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'becoming', 'whiny', 'teen.Thankfully', 'doubts', 'fears', 'quickly', 'subsided', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'quot', 'Smallville', 'quot', 'thankfully', 'gathered', 'huge', '6', 'discs', 'set', '21', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'including', 'pilot', 'show', 'wonder', 'behold', 'filled', 'great', 'performances', 'wondeful', 'setting', 'great', 'dialogue', 'stories', 'continue', 'suprise', 'amaze', 'Superman', 'fan', 'great', 'see', 'cool', 'little', 'moments', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'having', 'adjust', 'develop', 'powers', 'appear', 'as', 'well', 'try', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'teenager', 'crush', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'again', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'other', 'typical', 'teenager', 'issues.Many', 'characters', 'comics', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'Jonathan', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'as', 'well', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Pete', 'Ross', 'who', 'fairly', 'minor', 'character', 'comics', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'ones', 'Chloe', 'Clark', 'good', 'friend', 'Whitney', 'Lana', 'boyfriend', 'combine', 'well', 'crafted', 'believeable', 'cast', 'Fans', 'will', 'snicker', 'adore', 'little', 'ironic', 'moments', 'hint', 'what', 'Clark', 'will', 'eventually', 'become', 'Little', 'parts', 'here', 'there', 'there', 'nonetheless', 'biggest', 'one', 'fact', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'could', ""n't"", 'count', 'number', 'times', 'was', 'feeling', 'foreboding', 'destinic', 'action', 'almost', 'scene', 'two', 'favorite', 'was', 'when', 'Clark', 'asked', 'Lex', 'how', 'long', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'friends', 'Lex', 'simply', 'replied', 'quot', 'friendship', 'will', 'be', 'stuff', 'legend.', 'quot', 'was', 'certianly', 'right', 'Best', 'writing', 'ever', 'type', 'series', 'are', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'comparisons', 'other', 'stuff', 'quot', 'Creek', 'quot', 'kinda', 'steer', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'helped', 'quot', 'Creek', 'quot', 'was', 'bunch', 'teens', 'growing', 'up', 'finding', 'quot', 'Smallville', 'quot', 'esentially', 'same', 'thing', 'only', 'superpowers', 'tons', 'special', 'effects', 'mix', 'thing', 'unique', 'show', 'terms', 'superhero', 'show', 'more', 'alter', 'ego', 'hero', 'Superman', 'show', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Definately', 'up', ""'re"", 'fan', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'immensly', ""'re"", 'just', 'getting', 'great', 'way', 'start']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

602028,A31U2QT7SAL7K,B00005JLKB,"Reginald D. Garrard ""the G-man""","[5, 5]","I initially dismissed ""Smallville"" because it was airing on the WB, a network known for its propensity for catering to the ""teen crowd."" I assumed that this take on the Superman character would be geared to that age group and would not be of interest to those of us more ""mature"" viewers. However, after seeing one episode of the show, I was hooked and have been a staunch supporter of the series for the past six years.In revisiting the season one episodes, I've discovered how the show has grown and remains one of the best-written, acted, and enjoyable shows on network television. The series, as fans of the show know, deals with the young Clark Kent as he adjusts to his developing superhero powers while he struggles with growing up and finding his destiny as the future ""Man of Steel.""Season one is a great start for the show, introducing the viewer to the characters long a part of the superhero mythology: Lex Luthor, Lana Lang, Jonathan and Martha Kent, along with new characters developed for the show (Clark's friends Pete Ross and Chloe Sullivan, along with Lex's father, Lionel). Each character gets a chance to shine in stories where they take center stage or have some necessary interaction with the development of Clark Kent.The cast is superb with special kudos to John Glover (Lionel), Michael Rosenbaum (Lex), Allison Mack (Chloe), John Schnieder (Jonathan), and Annette O'Toole (Martha). Star Tom Welling is appropriately strong yet vulnerable in his assessment of the young Clark. Kristen Kreuk is devastatingly beautiful and does well in the role of the object of Clark's desire. Sam Jones III does well in an underwritten part as Clark's best bud, Pete.  Even the lesser character of Whitney, Lana's boyfriend (Eric Johnson) grows from dumb jock to a sympathetic character that becomes essential to events during the run of the first season.Also, the show has an impressive line of genre guest stars: Joe Morton (""Terminator: Judgment Day""), Corin Nemic (""Stargate: SG1""), ""George Murdock (""God"" in ""Star Trek: The Final Frontier""), and Shawn Ashmore (""The X-Men"" movies).The writers have been careful to add freshness to the well-known upbringing of Superman in the mythical town of Smallville, Kansas. For much of the first season, the stories dealt with the effects of ""meteor rocks (remnants of the exploding planet Kryton) that accompanied Kal-el (Clark's Krytonian birthname) as he descended to his new earthly home. It appears that the small Kansas town became a haven for things weird and unexplainable.Each single word title is crafted to be both a revelation of the story but also a peek at character insight and development. For example, ""Hothead,"" features Dan Lauria as a fiery and determined-to-win-at-all-costs football coach, infected by the ""meteor rocks,"" that is able to summon up flames with just a single thought. ""Reaper"" is a macabre offering about a recently deceased young man, brought back from death by the aforementioned ""meteor rocks,"" that is able to ""take away the pain"" of terminal patients, as a harbinger of death.Music is an integral part of the show and Mark Snow, formerly chief composer for ""The X-Files,"" does an outstanding job in creating music that is appropriately mysterious, thrilling, and poignant. Also, each installment makes use of musical snippets by contemporary pop/rock artists and the theme by Remy Zero (the group appears in the season finale) fits perfectly for this retelling.Impressive special effects and eye-popping pyrotechnics abound but never overshadow the story.Vancouver locations are beautiful, though a bit too picturesque for Kansas. Even The Kent farm has an idyllic quality and is a tad too ""upscale"" for a family that appears to be always struggling financially. But, those are just two complaints for an overall top-quality production.It also appears that the meteor rocks must have given everyone a resiliency to withstand severe falls and knocks on the head. From the number of times the Lex, Chloe, Lana, Pete, Whitney, and Jonathan get tossed around on the show, they should have reserved rooms in the Smallville hospital.And the Kent family truck must be built out of the same material as Clark's spaceship for it takes many a tumble but keeps on ticking...until the last episode of the year.",5,An outstanding NEW beginning for the Superman legend,1167264000,"12 28, 2006",2006,4294,"['initially', 'dismissed', 'Smallville', 'was', 'airing', 'WB', 'network', 'known', 'propensity', 'catering', 'teen', 'crowd', 'assumed', 'take', 'Superman', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'geared', 'age', 'group', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'interest', 'more', 'mature', 'viewers', 'However', 'seeing', 'one', 'episode', 'show', 'was', 'hooked', 'have', 'been', 'staunch', 'supporter', 'series', 'past', 'six', 'years.In', 'revisiting', 'season', 'one', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'how', 'show', 'grown', 'one', 'best-written', 'acted', 'enjoyable', 'shows', 'network', 'television', 'series', 'fans', 'show', 'know', 'deals', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'developing', 'superhero', 'powers', 'growing', 'up', 'finding', 'destiny', 'future', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Season', 'one', 'great', 'start', 'show', 'introducing', 'viewer', 'characters', 'long', 'part', 'superhero', 'mythology', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Jonathan', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'new', 'characters', 'developed', 'show', 'Clark', 'friends', 'Pete', 'Ross', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'Lex', 'father', 'Lionel', 'character', 'chance', 'shine', 'stories', 'where', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'have', 'necessary', 'interaction', 'development', 'Clark', 'Kent.The', 'cast', 'superb', 'special', 'kudos', 'John', 'Glover', 'Lionel', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Lex', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'Chloe', 'John', 'Schnieder', 'Jonathan', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'Martha', 'Star', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'appropriately', 'strong', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'assessment', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'devastatingly', 'beautiful', 'well', 'role', 'object', 'Clark', 'desire', 'Sam', 'Jones', 'III', 'well', 'underwritten', 'part', 'Clark', 'best', 'bud', 'Pete', 'Even', 'lesser', 'character', 'Whitney', 'Lana', 'boyfriend', 'Eric', 'Johnson', 'dumb', 'jock', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'essential', 'events', 'run', 'first', 'season.Also', 'show', 'impressive', 'line', 'genre', 'guest', 'stars', 'Joe', 'Morton', 'Terminator', 'Judgment', 'Day', 'Corin', 'Nemic', 'Stargate', 'SG1', 'George', 'Murdock', 'God', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Final', 'Frontier', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'X-Men', 'movies', '.The', 'writers', 'have', 'been', 'careful', 'add', 'freshness', 'well-known', 'upbringing', 'Superman', 'mythical', 'town', 'Smallville', 'Kansas', 'much', 'first', 'season', 'stories', 'dealt', 'effects', 'meteor', 'rocks', 'remnants', 'exploding', 'planet', 'Kryton', 'accompanied', 'Kal-el', 'Clark', 'Krytonian', 'birthname', 'descended', 'new', 'earthly', 'home', 'small', 'Kansas', 'town', 'became', 'haven', 'things', 'weird', 'unexplainable.Each', 'single', 'word', 'title', 'crafted', 'be', 'revelation', 'story', 'also', 'peek', 'character', 'insight', 'development', 'example', 'Hothead', 'Dan', 'Lauria', 'fiery', 'determined-to-win-at-all-costs', 'football', 'coach', 'infected', 'meteor', 'rocks', 'able', 'summon', 'up', 'flames', 'just', 'single', 'thought', 'Reaper', 'macabre', 'offering', 'recently', 'deceased', 'young', 'man', 'brought', 'back', 'death', 'aforementioned', 'meteor', 'rocks', 'able', 'take', 'away', 'pain', 'terminal', 'patients', 'harbinger', 'death.Music', 'integral', 'part', 'show', 'Mark', 'Snow', 'formerly', 'chief', 'composer', 'X-Files', 'outstanding', 'job', 'creating', 'music', 'appropriately', 'mysterious', 'thrilling', 'poignant', 'Also', 'installment', 'use', 'musical', 'snippets', 'contemporary', 'pop/rock', 'artists', 'theme', 'Remy', 'Zero', 'group', 'season', 'finale', 'perfectly', 'retelling.Impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'eye-popping', 'pyrotechnics', 'abound', 'never', 'overshadow', 'story.Vancouver', 'locations', 'are', 'beautiful', 'bit', 'too', 'picturesque', 'Kansas', 'Even', 'Kent', 'farm', 'idyllic', 'quality', 'tad', 'too', 'upscale', 'family', 'be', 'always', 'struggling', 'financially', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'complaints', 'overall', 'top-quality', 'production.It', 'also', 'meteor', 'rocks', 'must', 'have', 'given', 'everyone', 'resiliency', 'withstand', 'severe', 'falls', 'knocks', 'head', 'number', 'times', 'Lex', 'Chloe', 'Lana', 'Pete', 'Whitney', 'Jonathan', 'get', 'tossed', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'reserved', 'rooms', 'Smallville', 'hospital.And', 'Kent', 'family', 'truck', 'must', 'be', 'built', 'same', 'material', 'Clark', 'spaceship', 'many', 'tumble', 'ticking', 'last', 'episode', 'year']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)
602029,A2JSXC9QM8F5VS,B00005JLKB,Rei Shinozuka,"[0, 1]","Having followed Superman since the George Reeves TV show, and the comics from the 60's, and the first couple of Christopher Reeves films.  I'm pretty generally happy with the genre.  I've sort of fallen off the reinventions of Superman, haven't seen the Lois and Clark, and the new movie with Kevin Spacey.I originally stayed away from Smallville because the advertising made it appear racier than it turned out, and furthermore the crucifixion imagery was a bit disturbing.I finally bought this set because I thought it might bring a contemporary feel my 10-year old son would appreciate.  What I found impressed me quite a bit, especially the pilot episode.  Rather than retell the Superman story, the assumption is that the viewer is fully acquainted with the lore.  Thus they don't need to reenact the entire Superman myth, from Krypton and so on.  I imagine more of the backstory will come out over time (I've only see the first 3 episodes).  There's a healthy dose of X-Files moodiness around some of the antagonists who appear in the episodes.What makes me think the series is a success is when my kids said ""I thought Lex Luthor and Superman were enemies... what happened.""  And I told them: ""That's what makes it so compelling--you see how they meet, and you know from the lore where they end up, but exactly how and over what time their relationships is going to be very interesting.""  And that anticipation is what makes me want to keep watching the show.I should add the acting very good all around, and it's really nice to see familiar faces like John Schneider and Annette O'Toole (back from Superman III in a new role).",5,A Great Reworking--Even from A Traditionalist's Point of VIew,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,1634,"['Having', 'followed', 'Superman', 'George', 'Reeves', 'TV', 'show', 'comics', '60', 'first', 'couple', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'films', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'generally', 'happy', 'genre', ""'ve"", 'sort', 'fallen', 'reinventions', 'Superman', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'new', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Spacey.I', 'originally', 'stayed', 'away', 'Smallville', 'advertising', 'made', 'appear', 'racier', 'turned', 'out', 'furthermore', 'crucifixion', 'imagery', 'was', 'bit', 'disturbing.I', 'finally', 'bought', 'set', 'thought', 'might', 'bring', 'contemporary', 'feel', '10-year', 'old', 'son', 'would', 'appreciate', 'What', 'found', 'impressed', 'quite', 'bit', 'especially', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Rather', 'retell', 'Superman', 'story', 'assumption', 'viewer', 'fully', 'acquainted', 'lore', 'Thus', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'reenact', 'entire', 'Superman', 'myth', 'Krypton', 'so', 'imagine', 'more', 'backstory', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'time', ""'ve"", 'only', 'see', 'first', '3', 'episodes', 'healthy', 'dose', 'X-Files', 'moodiness', 'antagonists', 'who', 'appear', 'episodes.What', 'think', 'series', 'success', 'when', 'kids', 'said', 'thought', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Superman', 'were', 'enemies', 'what', 'happened', 'told', 'what', 'so', 'compelling', 'see', 'how', 'meet', 'know', 'lore', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'exactly', 'how', 'what', 'time', 'relationships', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'anticipation', 'what', 'want', 'keep', 'watching', 'show.I', 'should', 'add', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'really', 'nice', 'see', 'familiar', 'John', 'Schneider', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'back', 'Superman', 'III', 'new', 'role']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

For most of the townsfolk, the event brought great losses and unexplainable results, but for the caring Kent Family (John Schneider & Annette O'Toole), it blessed them with an amazing gift: a son who will become Earth's greatest champion.

The Dolby Digital 2.0 sound is satisfactory with decent surround effects. The box set includes two commentary tracks by series creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, several deleted scenes from the pilot and second episode, ""Storyboard to Screen"" featurette, an interactive tour of Smallville, some promotional material and DVD-ROM extras. Overall, ""Smallville: The Complte First Season"" scores a ""B"".",4,Legacy,1067990400,"11 5, 2003",2003,1784,"['battling', 'forces', 'evil', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'faced', 'greatest', 'challenge', 'high', 'school', 'WB', 'engaging', 'hit', 'drama', 'finally', 'arrived', 'DVD', 'A', 'devastating', 'meteor', 'shower', 'peaceful', 'town', 'Smallville', 'most', 'townsfolk', 'event', 'brought', 'great', 'losses', 'unexplainable', 'results', 'caring', 'Kent', 'Family', 'John', 'Schneider', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'blessed', 'amazing', 'gift', 'son', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'Earth', 'greatest', 'champion', 'Producers', 'Alfred', 'Gough', 'Miles', 'Millar', 'have', 'developed', 'original', 'appealing', 'twist', 'Superman', 'myth', 'Smallville', 'popular', 'live-action', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'adapting', 'superhuman', 'powers', 'friendship', 'future', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'developing', 'relationship', 'sweetheart', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'series', 'surprising', 'mix', 'coming-of-age', 'drama', 'comic-book', 'fantasy', 'Smallville', 'also', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'stunning', 'visual', 'effects', 'first', 'season', 'Smallville', 'definitely', 'viewers', 'entertained', 'too', 'many', 'Villain', 'Week', 'give', 'show', 'repetitive', 'nature.Fans', 'WB', 'drama', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'Smallville', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', '21', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'presented', '1.78:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'format', 'picture', 'quality', 'quite', 'bright', 'reasonably', 'sharp', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'sound', 'satisfactory', 'decent', 'surround', 'effects', 'box', 'set', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'series', 'creators', 'Alfred', 'Gough', 'Miles', 'Millar', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'pilot', 'second', 'episode', 'Storyboard', 'Screen', 'featurette', 'interactive', 'tour', 'Smallville', 'promotional', 'material', 'DVD-ROM', 'extras', 'Overall', 'Smallville', 'Complte', 'First', 'Season', 'B']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

With Smallville comparisons to Buffy seem almost inevitable to me.  Both shows sport almost invulnerable main characters with a variety of super-human abilities.  Both rely on a core cast of close friends.  Both main characters have older-mentors they blow off half of the time and then regret not listening to in the first place.  And finally, both have serious romantic issues-and this is where our heroes part ways.  Buffy's issues get resolved with very dark consequences where everyone around her is affected in a permanent manner.  With Clark Kent, however, there is this  butterfly-like dance of relationships that he has with various friends over the course of each season that involves him avoiding any serious commitment, and in the end remaining in a kind of emotional limbo with his close friends and loved ones.  More importantly, the friends, especially Chloe and Lana are like emotional yo-yos wildly flitting from jealousy to weepy love, to grim-faced resolve to be their own girl and blow Clark off once and for all.  The big question is what, if anything does this do for the series?  For the first season these issues can and should easily be forgiven as any series needs time to find its footing.  All niggling aside, the good easily outweighs the bad in the first season.  The acting from the leads is rock-solid.  Tom Welling is charming as the young Clark Kent without being too cocky and arrogant.  Kristin Kreuk and Alison Mack may take some getting used to as Clark's respective potential love interests, Lana Lane and Chloe, as they are not given much room by the writers to grow and develop very much this season.  John Schneider (you know him as Bo Duke) and Annette O'Toole provide a convincing balance between moral sternness and flexibility that still gives Clark enough freedom to be the typical teen.  My favorite is Michael Rosenbaum's portrayal of an almost tragic Lex Luthor who constantly tries to do the right thing, but is mired down by his evil corporate family reputation.  The basic premise of the season is that Clark has to come to terms with the fact he is quite different from everyone around him while at the same time coming to the aid of everyone who got, and is still being affected and transformed by the meteor rock that smashed into Smallville on the day of Clark's arrival to earth.  Although there is no story-arc or Big Bad that the viewer may have become accustomed to from the Buffy and X-Files shows, the episodes have an intriguing monster-of-the-week format; intriguing because the kids affected and transformed by the meteor rocks are not always clearly cut from the psychotic cloth (I think only one of the villains actually foams at the mouth at some point).  Highlights include, ""Pilot"" where Clark becomes the Smallville scarecrow of ridicule for the football season; ""Shimmer"" where this meek girl who has a crush on Lex supposedly can turn herself invisible; and ""Tempest"" where Clark, Lana, and Chloe's emotional love triangle gets resolved, or at least allowed to go into extra innings.  The DVD extras are featurettes that introduce Smallville the town.  My favorite was the interactive map.  There are deleted scenes which are pretty nice.  All in all, a good potential for greatness.",5,Brave New Metropolis,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,3336,"['Ok', 'Metropolis', ""n't"", 'cards', 'awhile', 'yet', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Smallville', 'comparisons', 'Buffy', 'seem', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'shows', 'sport', 'almost', 'invulnerable', 'main', 'characters', 'variety', 'super-human', 'abilities', 'rely', 'core', 'cast', 'close', 'friends', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'older-mentors', 'blow', 'half', 'time', 'then', 'regret', 'not', 'listening', 'first', 'place', 'finally', 'have', 'serious', 'romantic', 'issues-and', 'where', 'heroes', 'part', 'ways', 'Buffy', 'issues', 'get', 'resolved', 'very', 'dark', 'consequences', 'where', 'everyone', 'affected', 'permanent', 'manner', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'however', 'butterfly-like', 'dance', 'relationships', 'various', 'friends', 'course', 'season', 'avoiding', 'serious', 'commitment', 'end', 'remaining', 'kind', 'emotional', 'limbo', 'close', 'friends', 'loved', 'ones', 'More', 'importantly', 'friends', 'especially', 'Chloe', 'Lana', 'are', 'emotional', 'yo-yos', 'wildly', 'flitting', 'jealousy', 'weepy', 'love', 'grim-faced', 'resolve', 'be', 'own', 'girl', 'blow', 'Clark', 'once', 'big', 'question', 'what', 'anything', 'do', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'issues', 'can', 'should', 'easily', 'be', 'forgiven', 'series', 'time', 'find', 'footing', 'niggling', 'aside', 'good', 'easily', 'bad', 'first', 'season', 'acting', 'leads', 'rock-solid', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'charming', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'being', 'too', 'cocky', 'arrogant', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Alison', 'Mack', 'may', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'Clark', 'respective', 'potential', 'love', 'interests', 'Lana', 'Lane', 'Chloe', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'room', 'writers', 'grow', 'develop', 'very', 'much', 'season', 'John', 'Schneider', 'know', 'Bo', 'Duke', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'provide', 'convincing', 'balance', 'moral', 'sternness', 'flexibility', 'still', 'Clark', 'enough', 'freedom', 'be', 'typical', 'teen', 'favorite', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'portrayal', 'almost', 'tragic', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'who', 'constantly', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'mired', 'down', 'evil', 'corporate', 'family', 'reputation', 'basic', 'premise', 'season', 'Clark', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'quite', 'different', 'everyone', 'same', 'time', 'coming', 'aid', 'everyone', 'who', 'got', 'still', 'being', 'affected', 'transformed', 'meteor', 'rock', 'smashed', 'Smallville', 'day', 'Clark', 'arrival', 'earth', 'story-arc', 'Big', 'Bad', 'viewer', 'may', 'have', 'become', 'accustomed', 'Buffy', 'X-Files', 'shows', 'episodes', 'have', 'intriguing', 'monster-of-the-week', 'format', 'intriguing', 'kids', 'affected', 'transformed', 'meteor', 'rocks', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'clearly', 'cut', 'psychotic', 'cloth', 'think', 'only', 'one', 'villains', 'actually', 'foams', 'mouth', 'point', 'Highlights', 'include', 'Pilot', 'where', 'Clark', 'Smallville', 'scarecrow', 'ridicule', 'football', 'season', 'Shimmer', 'where', 'meek', 'girl', 'who', 'crush', 'Lex', 'supposedly', 'can', 'turn', 'invisible', 'Tempest', 'where', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'Chloe', 'emotional', 'love', 'triangle', 'resolved', 'least', 'allowed', 'go', 'extra', 'innings', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'introduce', 'Smallville', 'town', 'favorite', 'was', 'interactive', 'map', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'nice', 'good', 'potential', 'greatness']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)
602035,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JLKB,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","Although I have a couple of major complaints (more of that below) about SMALLVILLE, there is no question that the producers have framed the show with a fascinating premise. I grew up reading the Superman comics, but try as I might, I could never get excited about the Superboy stories. Little Clark Kent was basically the adult Superman in a smaller body with a flying dog. SMALLVILLE, however, features Clark Kent as Superman-in-progress, in possession of some of his powers, lacking in others, and developing as a person. This not-quite version of Superman is a great variation on the Superman legend. Even better is the show's take on Lex Luthor, changing him from a James Bond-like super villain into a complex, conflicted, troubled young man attempting to escape the influence of his ruthless entrepreneur father Lionel Luthor. In Season One, Lex is someone who is largely trying to be a better person than he has been, someone trying to escape his familial destiny, and striving to be a good friend to the slightly younger Clark Kent, who he meets when Clark saves him from drowning after his car crashes into a river. Both in the producers' conception of Lex and in the exceptional performance by Michael Rosenbaum, Lex Luthor develops into the most interesting character on the show.In fact, the entire regular cast of SMALLVILLE adds a great deal to the show as a whole, with the exception of the thankless job assigned to Eric Johnson of playing the ""fifth wheel"" (i.e., Lana Lang's boyfriend Whitney Fordman) in the series. Kristin Kreuk, who is an absolutely impossibly cute young woman, is beyond perfect as Lana Lang, the object of Clark's affection. The former Bo Duke, John Schneider, is convincing as Clark's dad, and Annette O'Toole is just as fine as his mother. Allison Mack is a great addition to the Superman back-story as Clark's close friend Chloe. And in the most crucial role, Tom Welling, though tending a bit to woodenness in his acting at times, is pretty much everything you could hope for as Clark.Despite all this, the show isn't nearly as good as it ought to be, and the fault of that lies in two definite tendencies. First, Season One is largely marred by an over reliance by an unfortunate gimmick: the almost weekly appearance of villains made so by their encounters with ""meteor rocks"" (i.e., kryptonite), always resulting in the acquisition of some ability that creates a tendency to perform evil deeds. The second is a general weakness in the writing on the show, especially touching the ""freak of the week"" stories. The writing on the season long story arc, on the other hand, is much, much stronger, and usually sustains the interest of the viewer over the relatively flat stories. The stand-alone plots are sometimes excruciatingly weak, coming across like bad imitations of some of the weaker X-FILES episodes. The X-FILES connection is, by the way, fairly strong, with many actors who appeared in that show also appearing in SMALLVILLE, perhaps because both shows were filmed in Vancouver (though THE X-FILES moved to L.A. after Season Five). For instance, Chloe's father is played by Robert Wisden, who guest starred in two exceptionally fine X-FILES episodes as ""the pusher"" Robert Patrick Modell, a man who can take over the will of other people. The first episode was directed by David Nutter, a veteran X-FILES director, and the original music on the show is provided by the great Mark Snow. A large number of key production people also have ties with THE X-FILES, including Matt Beck, in charge of visual effects for both shows. In Season Two we find Krista Allen, who guest starred in the notoriously awful ""First Person Shooter"" (widely considered one of the four or five worst X-FILES episodes), briefly becomes Lex Luthor's wife in Season Two, and the part of the mayor of Smallville is noneother than the Cigarette Smoking Man himself, William B. Davis. The connection between the two shows was made even more explicit in Season Three, when Michael McKean (who made appearances on both shows) played Perry White, who at the time was working not for the Daily Planet but ""The X-Styles.""I haven't seen Seasons Two through Four yet, but my hope is that the producers realized that the ""freak of the week"" storylines hampered the show as a whole, that the true interest in the series is the interrelations between Clark and Lex and Lana and Chloe and the rest. I kept having the sensation that there was a potentially great show trapped inside one that wasn't nearly as interesting.The show is a lot of fun for anyone familiar with the Superman story. Almost every episode features multiple jokes at the expense of the Superman legend, like an air force recruiting officer coming up to Clark and asking, ""Don't you wish you could fly?"" or Clark at an art museum looking at a breast plate that contains a figure that looks conspicuously like an ""S"" and insisting that he would never wear such an outfit. Clark is almost always wearing some combination of blue, red, and yellow, the colors, of course, in the Superman uniform.All in all, this is a good show, much better, I will admit, than I was expecting. It should have been better, and I have my hopes that the writing improved in subsequent seasons.",4,"A good start, but it gets better and better in future seasons",1117670400,"06 2,

602036,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B00005JLKB,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[1, 6]","When Smallville first debuted, I was initially skeptical of the premise. It was one thing to delve into Clark Kent's psyche (as did the earlier Lois ans Clark) but not being a fan of my own small town existence, I wondered what a pre-Superman cannon addition could seriously offer myself other than brooding good looks.Vauglely remembering the Dukes of Hazzard from my own early childhood, I also wondered what strange grip John Schneider had on hollywood (incriminiating conversations, photos..etc) to cast him as Jonathan ""Pa"" Kent, who should (by all accounts) be a heavyset bespectacled older man. Annette O'Toole (Lana from the movies) is a generally agreeable choice for Martha ""Ma"" Kent in the tradition of intra-franchise joking, but the two seem too sophisticated for the roles, even by previous series standards which made it clear open-minded people lived in all areas of the country (including small-town family farms).Also problematic is the series repeated inistence that Smallville is only a short distance from Metropolis when it has been previously established on the East Coast (approximately where New York City resides)in numerous earlier Superman incarnations (his being able to travel home in minutes for counseling from the parents).Reeling from Buffy's untimely cancelation, I managed to find some captivating portions of this series which would be memorable for anybody willing to wade through and/or overlook the earlier mentioned nitpicks. This series obviously borrows heavily from the long-established DC franchise, but it also subtlely infuses a healthy dose of sophisticated political commentary.Hinting at the real-life current challenges facing many students with disabilities and/or GLBT students, Clarks parents encourage him to be careful whom he tells the truth about himself to in their small 'close-minded' town and to remember his physical limitations (in his case being stronger than others, and/or staying away from the meteor rocks which dot the landscape and provide much of the challenges). Being different in a small town is different, and periodically stiffling for teens who do not fit a pre-defined cookie-cutter ideal, but internal strength (self esteem) immeasurably helps find your way through (and yourself in) the tourtorous ordeal.Partly as a result of this same leveling experience, Clark develops great empathy for others and concern for social justice---later becoming the famed ""Man of Steel"".In one episode which remains eerily reminicent of the real-life murder of University of Wyoming college student Matthew Shepard, Clark is [unclothed] and tied to a fence post by the popular Smallville High jock in retailiation for making eyes at his long-time crush Lana Lang.Because Lana is still in the phase where she wears a fragment of the meteor rock around her neck in memory of her dead parents, Clark cannot physically get near her for most of this season without getting ill.Indicative of his future with Lois Lane (of the Terri Hatcher era), we also meet Chloe Sullivan, the editor of the high school newspaper, the Torch who favors herself a cross between Woodward/Bernstein and Gloria Steinem. Lana's polar opposite in both dress and demeanor, Chloe suspects there is far more going on in the town than what the authority figures are telling her, but cannot yet figure it out despite her most persistent intentions (which are amazingly accurate in many instances). Even at this point in his life, Clark recognizes he is attracted to strong and independent-minded women, but cannot himself figure out how to reveal his idenitity without being reduced to [strange] status on her infamous ""Wall of Weird"" and presumably carted away to a research lab. If taking history seriously, he's eventually supposed to go out with Lana, but I really want to see these two together instead and think the resultant generated plotlines would be more interesting.",3,"Mixed production, but overall good show",1061078400,"08 17, 2003",2003,3910,"['When', 'Smallville', 'first', 'debuted', 'was', 'initially', 'skeptical', 'premise', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'delve', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'psyche', 'did', 'earlier', 'Lois', 'ans', 'Clark', 'not', 'being', 'fan', 'own', 'small', 'town', 'existence', 'wondered', 'what', 'pre-Superman', 'cannon', 'addition', 'could', 'seriously', 'offer', 'other', 'brooding', 'good', 'looks.Vauglely', 'remembering', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'own', 'early', 'childhood', 'also', 'wondered', 'what', 'strange', 'grip', 'John', 'Schneider', 'had', 'hollywood', 'incriminiating', 'conversations', 'photos..etc', 'cast', 'Jonathan', 'Pa', 'Kent', 'who', 'should', 'accounts', 'be', 'heavyset', 'bespectacled', 'older', 'man', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'Lana', 'movies', 'generally', 'agreeable', 'choice', 'Martha', 'Ma', 'Kent', 'tradition', 'intra-franchise', 'joking', 'two', 'seem', 'too', 'sophisticated', 'roles', 'even', 'previous', 'series', 'standards', 'made', 'clear', 'open-minded', 'people', 'lived', 'areas', 'country', 'including', 'small-town', 'family', 'farms', '.Also', 'problematic', 'series', 'repeated', 'inistence', 'Smallville', 'only', 'short', 'distance', 'Metropolis', 'when', 'been', 'previously', 'established', 'East', 'Coast', 'approximately', 'where', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'resides', 'numerous', 'earlier', 'Superman', 'incarnations', 'being', 'able', 'travel', 'home', 'minutes', 'counseling', 'parents', '.Reeling', 'Buffy', 'untimely', 'cancelation', 'managed', 'find', 'captivating', 'portions', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'memorable', 'anybody', 'willing', 'wade', 'and/or', 'overlook', 'earlier', 'mentioned', 'nitpicks', 'series', 'obviously', 'heavily', 'long-established', 'DC', 'franchise', 'also', 'subtlely', 'healthy', 'dose', 'sophisticated', 'political', 'commentary.Hinting', 'real-life', 'current', 'challenges', 'facing', 'many', 'students', 'disabilities', 'and/or', 'GLBT', 'students', 'Clarks', 'parents', 'encourage', 'be', 'careful', 'whom', 'truth', 'small', ""'close-minded"", 'town', 'remember', 'physical', 'limitations', 'case', 'being', 'stronger', 'others', 'and/or', 'staying', 'away', 'meteor', 'rocks', 'dot', 'landscape', 'provide', 'much', 'challenges', 'Being', 'different', 'small', 'town', 'different', 'periodically', 'stiffling', 'teens', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'pre-defined', 'cookie-cutter', 'ideal', 'internal', 'strength', 'esteem', 'immeasurably', 'find', 'way', 'tourtorous', 'ordeal.Partly', 'result', 'same', 'leveling', 'experience', 'Clark', 'great', 'empathy', 'others', 'concern', 'social', 'justice', '-later', 'becoming', 'famed', 'Man', 'Steel', 'one', 'episode', 'eerily', 'reminicent', 'real-life', 'murder', 'University', 'Wyoming', 'college', 'student', 'Matthew', 'Shepard', 'Clark', '[', 'unclothed', ']', 'tied', 'fence', 'post', 'popular', 'Smallville', 'High', 'jock', 'retailiation', 'making', 'eyes', 'long-time', 'crush', 'Lana', 'Lang.Because', 'Lana', 'still', 'phase', 'where', 'fragment', 'meteor', 'rock', 'neck', 'memory', 'dead', 'parents', 'Clark', 'can', 'not', 'physically', 'get', 'most', 'season', 'getting', 'ill.Indicative', 'future', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Terri', 'Hatcher', 'era', 'also', 'meet', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'editor', 'high', 'school', 'newspaper', 'Torch', 'who', 'cross', 'Woodward/Bernstein', 'Gloria', 'Steinem', 'Lana', 'polar', 'opposite', 'dress', 'demeanor', 'Chloe', 'far', 'more', 'going', 'town', 'what', 'authority', 'figures', 'are', 'telling', 'can', 'not', 'yet', 'figure', 'out', 'most', 'persistent', 'intentions', 'are', 'amazingly', 'accurate', 'many', 'instances', 'Even', 'point', 'life', 'Clark', 'attracted', 'strong', 'independent-minded', 'women', 'can', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'reveal', 'idenitity', 'being', 'reduced', '[', 'strange', ']', 'status', 'infamous', 'Wall', 'Weird', 'presumably', 'carted', 'away', 'research', 'lab', 'taking', 'history', 'seriously', 'eventually', 'supposed', 'go', 'out', 'Lana', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'two', 'together', 'instead', 'think', 'resultant', 'generated', 'plotlines', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'interesting']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

602039,A2NZDF1UEUQGOD,B00005JLKB,Sasja Frahm Olesen,"[10, 12]","Smallville caught my attention being aired next to Angel, but as I hate jumping in in the middle, I checked the rave reviews here and on that basis decided to get the dvd.  An important note here is that I'm a Buffy fan - if you are, too, I'm sure you'll find this review quite helpful.  If not, you may want to skip it.  Further, I'm 32, and my other favorite shows are Firefly and Angel, but I also enjoy shows like Six Feet Under, early Ally McBeal and (to some extend) Alias.  I've enjoyed superheroes comics and movies, but I'm not a superman fan.  However, as you can see, the supernatural in fiction appeals to me - though I do find for instance Charmed to be a waste of time - so I thought I might like Smallville a lot.The GoodI like what they've done with Lex Luthor.  He's an interesting character, poised between his corrupt father and wasted youth on one side, and his own aspirations to become a better person helped by his friendship with Clark on the other.  Michael Rosenbaum does a good job portraying him.  His dysfunctional relationship with his father and the power dynamics at Luthor Corp is by far the most interesting story line in the season.The first season's structure is basically monster-of-the-week, in many ways similar to Buffy season 1, featuring the mysterious cryptonite rocks instead of the Hellmouth.  Occasionally, the show manages to hit a nerve with the monster, in the same way Buffy did - putting the focus on eating disorders, ignored teens becoming invisible (ring a bell?), etc.The BadSmallville season 1 has such similarities with Buffy season 1 that I can't help comparing them: High school superheroes with secret identities fight supernatural evil, helped and sometimes hampered by friends and family.  I think all Smallville's main flaws can be seen more clearly in a comparison between the two.  Smallville is like a thin cup Buffy, being inferior in a number of ways:- Realistic and/or interesting desciption of the relationship to parents.  Buffy's living alone with her mother, who has her own stressed life, and while she clearly cares about her daughter, she's often having a hard time understanding and communicating with her.  Though Smallville takes place in present days, Clark's parents are taken out of a 50s soap (""Father knows best"" springs to mind), and their problems are so small and superficial that any person actually having experienced their teens will be fighting nausea from time to time.- Gender roles.  Where Buffy has a strong positive message about girls with guts and strength of will, Smallville's big on the damselling.  The leading lady always keeps her voice down, smiles her little smile and is very accommodating to the various men in her life.  Sometimes you want to slap her.  Clark's best friend, Chloe, is a fountain of fun in comparison, but her part is more the comic sidekick than a rolemodel.- Acting.  While Buffy had its share of mediocre recurring characters and guest stars, the acting of Smallville's two main characters, Clark Kent and his main love interest Lana Lang, is terrible.  They do improve, as is the rule in television shows, but they're still not quite reaching 'adequate' as the season ends.- Humor.  Smallville just takes itself a little too serious.  I sorely missed the clever wit of Buffy.- Character.  As you can perhaps already tell from my comments on Superman's parents, there's just a little too much rosy Little house on the Priarie for this season to be truly compelling.  Their adventures don't seem to last any lasting mark on these kids.  They're just as well adapted and happy as they always were - the contrast to the much more serious problems the scooby gang from Buffy have is notable.  There are some hints that Clark feels uncomfortable with his powers, notably in an episode where he loses them.  However, there's no real indication of why that is - he's using his strength and speed to help out at the farm, doesn't have any hard training to do, nobody seems particularly intent on killing him, so all in all the worst part is that he has to keep them secret.- Redemption.  Another positive message in the Buffy/Angel verse is that redemption while never easy is always possible.  In Smallville, the characters are all goody good guys with loving relatives and no real troubles to speak of, with Lex being the only grey character - and we all know how he'll end up.  Not much room left for free will.In ConclusionI had actually made up my mind not to get season 2, but as season 1 ended with a cliffhanger, and seeing that there's unanimous agreement that season 2 is better than season 1 showing us more of the interesting Luthors, I ended up getting it anyway - so there were clearly some things I enjoyed in season 1 of Smallville.  A thin cup Buffy may still be quite nice.  Lots of teenagers love this series, but to anyone older I think you need to be a genre fan to really get into Smallville season 1.",3,"Watchable, but not great - comparing Smallville to

We (the viewers) are often forced to watch ludicrous &quot;realistic&quot; teen shows like &quot;The OC&quot; and &quot;90210&quot; when we know that they (the teen shows) don't even come close to accurately portraying teen life. Every once in a while we (the young adults) are blessed with more realistic shows like &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; and &quot;Smallville.&quot; These shows (with the exception of Dawson's Creek) are sci-fi fantasies but they ironically portray teen life in a more accurate light than any crappy Aaron Spelling Fox teen drama ever could. Smallville is brilliant because Clark Kent's problems with his powers offer a great metaphor for any kid that has ever felt different in high-school. It doesn't matter how popular or unpopular we were in high-school: we have all felt like an outcast at one time or another. Clark Kent and Buffy, (from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) like Spiderman, will always be great representations of our inner-outcast. They may fight monsters or Demons but they have the same problems we did. Smallville (over the years) has addressed many different teen issues like eating disorders and drug-use in a way that is more believable than any &quot;very special episode&quot; of 90210 or &quot;The OC.&quot;This DVD set contains the first season of the series. We are introduced to a teenage Clark Kent and a young Lex Luther. We see how they slowly start to grow into their future roles as Superman and the most evil man in Metropolis. We see Clark painfully deal with issues that we have all faced as he accepts his true destiny.I am so happy that the first season is on DVD. I can slowly get rid of my old VHS tapes of the first season that have been taking up too much room in my house. This DVD is a nice set that looks great on a decent TV.

602042,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B00005JLKB,Sean Pasek,"[5, 5]","I must confess that I didn't watch Smallville when it first premiered.  I thought, ""another show about Superman.  Geez!""  There had already been Lois and Clark which I could never get into.I've always liked Superman, but part of what didn't appeal to me about him is that he's just too powerful.  I had wished that he was more vulnerable, more human, to make him a bit more interesting.My best friend, who had been watching the show faithfully from the beginning told me to give a try.  I did.  And wow, was I surprised, most pleasantly!Here, I'm exposed to Clark Kent as a young teenager (even though it's obvious that Tom Welling is not a teen) who hasn't even reached the pinnacle of his powers yet.  In fact, he's a young man struggling to cope with these strange abilities.  We find that he has strength and speed, but that's about it.  He has an invulnerability that isn't quite at full strength yet.  Bullets bruise him, and he can feel the heat of intense fire.Exploring the early years of Clark Kent is more compelling than I thought it would be.  How does a teenage boy from who knows where (since Clark doesn't know where he's from) cope with the mysteries of his origins and his upcoming powers.  We find that as with any young teen, Clark struggles to do what is right, live a ""normal"" life, trying to fit in socially with his friends while trying to maintain his secret.Still this series is about ""believing to disbelieve.""  I mean, Metropolis in the middle of Kansas?  Clark grows up with a young Lex Luthor?Yet somehow, the writers make this work.  The meteor rocks effects upon the populace of Smallville was a great idea (even if they do overplay this card quite a bit as the series goes on).  It gives Clark some interesting people to fight who have been infected by the rocks.  Ironically, most those infected are teens as well.  We are able to draw comparisons of how a ""normal"" teen copes compared to how Clark copes.  As one may predict, the teens often find that too much power corrupts and they quickly begin to misuse their new-found gift.The cast is great in this show.  I do find Chloe a bit annoying and also the most unrealistic character.  How much access to information can a high school teen have?  She spends more time working on her paper than she does doing school work.  However, I find that Michael Rosenbaum brings a side of Lex Luthor that I've not yet seen on television or in the movies.  Lex is a good guy.  We find him battling his father, Lionel Luthor (and brilliantly portrayed by John Glover), and helping out his best friend, Clark Kent, even if he is also curious about the origins of his friend.  ""The road to evil is a journey, not a light switch,"" says Lex.  We see this a great, insightful line about how Lex will ultimately fall from grace.  Part of the appeal of the series is to see how the inevitable rift will form between Lex and Clark.There is also a great supporting cast in John Schnieder, Annette O'Toole, and Kristin Kreuk.  My only complaint is of the ill-used Sam Jones III as Pete Ross.  It appears the writers began to have a difficult time writing him into stories as Clark seems to have his hands full with Lex, Lana, and Chloe.If you're interested a fascinating ""take"" on the Superman saga, Smallville is a great place to do it.

602043,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00005JLKB,Sebastian Fernandez,"[1, 1]","I am in my thirties, so when I was a kid Superman was one of the main cartoons on TV and these comics were available everywhere. Throughout the years there have been many movies and series about this beloved superhero, but I am not aware of any that tackled Superman's life as a teenager. Therefore, ""Smallville"" fills a gap that fans everywhere love to finally see bridged. In this series we find answers to many questions about Superman, from why kryptonite weakens him to why Lex Luthor was a villain.In 1989 a meteorite storm hit Smallville, Kansas, killing many people, but bringing joy to a couple of farmers that were not able to have kids. The Kents find a small boy near a strange artifact, or maybe it was the boy that found them. They soon realize that this boy is different from other kids, and what a big difference it is! He has unbelievable strength and speed, and that is just the beginning. But not only the Kents saw their life change on that day in 1989, since Lex Luthor was visiting Smallville with his father and the shock of witnessing the meteorite shower left him bald for life.The connection between Lex and Clark was established at that first moment, but it is not until years later that they ""meet"". If that is what you would call Lex unintentionally running over Clark with his car and ending up in a lake from which he has to be rescued by the super teenager. Lex does not remember very well what happened, but he has suspicions; nevertheless, they become very good friends.Clark is different from other teenagers, but he feels exactly like every other one of them. He is in love with Lana Lang, the girlfriend of the quarterback of the high school's football team. Therefore, he wants to play football himself and upon his parents objections he promises not to use his ""natural advantage"" in the field. Of course, there are many other situations along these lines throughout the season.The story has a nice balance between the action and the constant development of the personal stories of the main characters. Also, the meteor shower had a myriad of secondary effects on many people, so we see villains with strange powers surface episode after episode and Clark Kent battling them.On top of the appeal from the plot's perspective and the background information on the most famous superhero of all time, the series counts with very good actors. Tom Welling is the best Superman I have seen among all the series and movies, and Michael Rosenbaum is absolutely perfect in the role of Lex Luthor. Most of the other members of the cast do not lag far behind.This is a must see series for anyone that has ever been interested in Superman. For the people that have been disappointed by previous experiences regarding movies or series featuring this superhero, I can only say that this effort surpasses them all and that you may be pleasantly surprised if you give it one more try.

Did TV really need to butcher another famous superhero icon? Fortunately for the viewers and everyone involved, Smallville got the formula right. Appealing to both casual and hardcore Superman fans, the series fleshes out the critical years of Clark Kent's early life. It puts a human face on a hero that has, more often than not, been treated as  an icon and not a character.Smallville rewrites the Superman mythology in several places, most notably by having Clark befriend a young Lex Luthor (note: this actually happened in the old comics, but was wiped out of continuity later on). These alterations work, and a large amount of the credit goes to the actors. Michael Rosenbaum *is* Lex Luthor, and Tom Welling is an equally-impressive Clark Kent. Rounding out the top-notch cast are Kristen Kreuk as Lana Lang, Annette O'Toole as Martha Kent, and Jonathan Schneider as Jonathan Kent. Special mention to Eric Johnson, playing the thankless role of Lana's jock boyfriend.Season 1 of Smallville could be considered pretty routine; major plot points are sprinkled here and there throughtout the season while Clark battles &quot;freak of the weeks&quot; who have been transformed by kryptonite. However, the cast has great chemistry, the effects are top notch, and even the most cliched of episodes become a guilty pleasure. The first few episodes are generally weak, but the latter half of the season and the cliffhanger finale demonstrate what Smallville is capable of.WB has done a decent job of releasing season 1. Decent in that audio/video is above average, but the extras are too few. WB basically got lazy and copied the extras over from the Canadian-only single-disc release of Smallville. Great if you've never seen these extras before, but so much more could've been added (disc 6 only houses 1 episode, leaving tons of unused space). Still, for a quality series like Smallville, extras are just icing on the cake. If you have any interest in Superman or have a soft-spot for teenage drama/action shows, I highly recommend Smallville.",4,"Before the super, meet the man",1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,2229,"['one', 'thought', 'would', 'work', 'concept', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'crosses', 'X-Files', 'crosses', 'Buffy', 'Superman', 'mythos', 'seemed', 'typical', 'quot', 'inspiration', 'quot', 'suits', 'WB', 'Did', 'TV', 'really', 'need', 'butcher', 'famous', 'superhero', 'icon', 'Fortunately', 'viewers', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Smallville', 'got', 'formula', 'right', 'Appealing', 'casual', 'hardcore', 'Superman', 'fans', 'series', 'out', 'critical', 'years', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'early', 'life', 'human', 'face', 'hero', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'been', 'treated', 'icon', 'not', 'character.Smallville', 'Superman', 'mythology', 'several', 'places', 'most', 'notably', 'having', 'Clark', 'befriend', 'young', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'note', 'actually', 'happened', 'old', 'comics', 'was', 'wiped', 'continuity', 'later', 'alterations', 'work', 'large', 'amount', 'credit', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', '*is*', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'equally-impressive', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Rounding', 'out', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'are', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'Martha', 'Kent', 'Jonathan', 'Schneider', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'Special', 'mention', 'Eric', 'Johnson', 'playing', 'thankless', 'role', 'Lana', 'jock', 'boyfriend.Season', '1', 'Smallville', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'pretty', 'routine', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'sprinkled', 'here', 'there', 'season', 'Clark', 'quot', 'freak', 'weeks', 'quot', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'transformed', 'kryptonite', 'However', 'cast', 'great', 'chemistry', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'even', 'most', 'cliched', 'episodes', 'become', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'generally', 'weak', 'latter', 'half', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'finale', 'demonstrate', 'what', 'Smallville', 'capable', 'of.WB', 'done', 'decent', 'job', 'releasing', 'season', '1', 'Decent', 'audio/video', 'above', 'average', 'extras', 'are', 'too', 'few', 'WB', 'basically', 'got', 'lazy', 'copied', 'extras', 'Canadian-only', 'single-disc', 'release', 'Smallville', 'Great', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'extras', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'added', 'disc', '6', 'only', 'houses', '1', 'episode', 'leaving', 'tons', 'unused', 'space', 'Still', 'quality', 'series', 'Smallville', 'extras', 'are', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'have', 'interest', 'Superman', 'have', 'soft-spot', 'teenage', 'drama/action', 'shows', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Smallville']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

Speaking of Roswell, Smallville owes alot to the popular series of young alien hybrids. Both are shows about a small town (also being the one-word title of the show) where a tall dark haired boy in his late teens has come from another world, only to be adopted by caring parents here. He has powers which he discovers by the day, (along with his siblings in Roswell's case) and gradually gains the trust of a group of friends. But there is danger at every turn! And just as Roswell was moved from its network, Smallville moved in - virtually a copy of the format, faster paced though not as thoughtful. But hey, Smallville has gone from strength to strength! After its powerhouse of a pilot, it began the typical 'freak of the week' first season that most fantasy shows (ie Buffy) step out with. As it does so, it builds a mythology of its own, and then uses that for the remaining seasons. Tom Welling is very likeable as Clark, and the cast (esp his parents) are very well cast. But dont expect to see this series end with him donning the red panties -- aint gonna happen! Although there are enough nods to his future self to make a significant list!Let's hope the show gets better and better (so far so good) and doesnt diminish by year 5. A tall order?

However, once the series settled into featuring a &quot;weekly bad guy&quot; I lost interest. Every episode spent more time on some kryptonite influenced aberration that challenged young Clark. I found the weekly bad guys to be wholly unbelievable and far too dominant in the story line - they overshadowed Clark's evolutionary awareness of his powers etc. The episode with the heat asborbing teenager pushed me over the edge of acceptability.So, for all you Superman fans, this series falls short of what it could and should be.

The only thing I would have to disagree with is the way in which they just throw a bad guy in there in 4 to 5 minutes of the show while the rest is crushed under the sex blanket of Clark and Lana, who by the way is not the sister he ends up with so stop insulting the audiences intellegence.",4,Almost Worthy,1044748800,"02 9, 2003",2003,872,"['not', 'cable', 'local', 'television', 'very', 'intriguing', 'look', 'young', 'life', 'Superman', 'think', 'more', 'teens', 'Do-me', 'Creek', 'Fa-sleep-with-city', 'first', 'season', 'unbelievably', 'edge', 'pushing', 'ground', 'breaking', 'cool', 'combonation', 'special', 'effects', 'dramatic', 'story', 'telling', 'personally', 'think', 'show', 'done', 'wonders', 'comic', 'book', 'world', 'Spiderman', 'X-men', 'theaters', 'good', 'see', 'worlds', 'youthful', 'imagination', 'creativity', 'are', 'growing', 'order', 'include', 'hip', 'new', 'versions', 'childhood', 'heroes', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'disagree', 'way', 'just', 'throw', 'bad', 'guy', 'there', '4', '5', 'minutes', 'show', 'rest', 'crushed', 'sex', 'blanket', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'who', 'way', 'not', 'sister', 'up', 'so', 'stop', 'insulting', 'audiences', 'intellegence']",SMALLVILLE: SEASON 1 (DVD)

I knew that when Smallville first came out on TV, it would either be a phenominal success, or a respunding flop. I'm certainly glad that it fell into the first catigory.This series has become extremely successful, because of the fact that it has broken away from the traditional views of Superman that we have come to be familiar with, while still following along those very views.  This show begins with the familiar rocket that crashes on the outskirts of the Kent Farm, setting the background of some of the characters. Lana Lang watches her perents die in the meteor storm that follows behind the ship, Lex Luthor is in the field where the rocket crashes, and we find his hair burnt to a crisp. Then jumping ahead a few years, to ""the present"", we learn how Clark Kent, Lana Lang and Lex Luthor all form an uneasy friendship, and how Clark deals with the powers that are bestowed upon him, still uncertain of their source, even we are made to question the source of his powers. But we know one thing, Clark Kent is not Superboy or Superman, he is just an everyday young man with the curse of these powers thrown upon him...Now, we can see these stories over and over again whenever we want.

Don't listen to what people say about it being ""Just another Teen Drama, but with aliens and mutants"". It's quite simply not. It's more than that. The show was of to a slightly rocky, and very formulatic start. Someone is obsessed with a girl, gets weird mutant powers from Kryptonite, uses them for ill (often involving homecide), and Clark defeats them with his powers, and the mutant dies somehow. But, the show quickly became much more focused on character interaction and drama, something that is sorely missing from the run-of-the-mill Superhero flicks of the 80's and 90's (i.e., the Batman and Superman movies). The show has truly breathed new life into the Superman franchise, and given Superman/Clark Kent an actual character, instead of the no-personality ""Truth, Justice, and the American Way"" character that he has always been. He is an actual person now.Season 1 is a bit rough here and there, but it managed to break loose from the formulatic episode structures before it ended, and Season 2 improved on it greatly. I sincerly hope that Warner Brothers re-considers their descision to make the new Superman movie be entirely seperate from the show, as I would very much love to see Tom Welling don the iconic red and blue Superman garb on the big screen.

602059,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00005JLKB,Tom Benton,"[2, 3]","Let me tell you one thing right off: before I began watching ""Smallville"", I was NOT a Superman fan.  I loved comic characters as a kid - Batman and Spider-Man especially.  Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker were interesting, emotion-filled, lifelike characters, and I loved them.  But Superman - to me, Superman was dull, the stereotypical superhero.  He was a stone, no drive, just flying around saving people and fighting aliens.  I never understood why he was so popular.Well, my opinion of Superman sure has changed.Over the last year I've been in ""experimental mode"" - that is, if I see something that seems interesting, I'll buy it and check out.  ""Smallville"" sounded somewhat interesting and it had a large fan base, so I figured, What the heck, I'll check it out.  And boy, am I glad I did.""Smallville"" is set during a time in Superman's life that has rarely been explored: his teenage years.  Throughout the show, young Clark Kent discovers his abilities and uses them to help (and, more often, save) others, all the while trying to mask his powers from the public - as well as his friends.  These friends are Pete, Clark's old best friend, and Chloe, the determined, curious head of the school newspaper.  And then there's Clark's best friend - Lex Luthor.Superman fans who have not seen or heard of the show (are there any?) surely just exclaimed ""What the f!*k!  Lex is Clark's best friend?!?!?!""  Yes, he is.  And that's just one of the many twists the show has.After I began watching ""Smallville"", I became very interested in the Superman mythos, so I scoured around and researched the character while watching other Superman-related entertainment.  Many Superman fans have come to hate ""Smallville"", because they say it messes up the Superman legend.  Now that I have a basic understanding of the Superman legend - well, maybe a little above basic - I think the exact opposite.  ""Smallville"" definitely changes around the Superman timeline, but only so much as to irritate die-hard fans only.  I think that the changes make the show fresh, and they're always interesting - the twists the show's creators have put in leave even Superman fans wondering who's gonna pop up next.Now back to show.  The casting is really fantastic.  Tom Welling was a perfect choice for Clark Kent.  He does a great job showing the many emotions Clark is feeling.  Kristin Kreuk is a great Lana.  She makes an otherwise unspectacular character very interesting.  Allison Mack is a fine choice for Chloe (she kind of reminds me of Kristen Bell as Veronica Mars).  John Schneider and Annette O'Toole play Clark's parents, and they both do a great job.  John Glover is perfectly cast as Lex's rich, ruthless father.  But for me, the real stand-out in the cast is Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor.  I've seen just about all the actors to portray Lex Luthor, and I've gotta say, in my opinion Michael does the best job.  Definitely a great choice.There isn't a bad episode in the entire first season.  Throughout the first half of the season, the show uses the same formula that ""Buffy"" used for its first season: in each episode, Clark must battle a different Kryptonite-created mutant.  (Well, in ""Buffy"" they weren't Kryptonite-created, but it was still the Hero vs. Monster formula)  But for the second half of the season, we're treated to very different storylines in each episode, each one being unique and absorbing.  It's a very well-written show.Definitely one of my favorite parts of the show is the music.  The show premiered when I was 11, so it's great to hear all these old hits that I remember on the show.  The show has a fantastic soundtrack, with loads of major songs in each episode.  The music really adds to the show.  One song obviously worth noting is Remy Zero's very fitting theme song, ""Save Me"".I was hooked on the show from the first episode, and I think anyone that gives the show a chance will be as well.  It's a clever, immensely entertaining, well-written show that is easily one of my favorites ever.

602065,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JLKB,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","Upon being first introduced to the WB's first season of Smallville, I laughed it off as a ""girly"" show, more ""Smallville's Creek"" than action/adventure show.  Boy, was I ever wrong...For all you guys out there, how many of you (when you were a little kid) ran around your living room dressed up in a Superman cape?  I would guess that a few hands were raised.  The dream of superpowers, flying, and saving the world from evil tend to appeal to little kids.  As we grow older and wiser (!) we tend to want to look deeper into things, explore different possibilities.  We can no longer take Superman at face value, we must dive in and try to find out his origins and why he is what he is.  Smallville caters directly to that need, answering (over the course of 5+ seasons) the questions about the Superman mythology.  The intriguing aspect of the show is that we already know what is going to happen.  The fun part is seeing HOW it happens.  What comic-book readers know already...-Clark Kent becomes SuperBoy/Man, falls for Lois Lane, breaks off a relationship with childhood sweetheart Lana Lang, and becomes a reporter for the Daily Planet in Metropolis.-Lex Luther becomes the ultimate criminal mastermind, devoting his life to destroying Superman.-Other various things, such as Clark's real name being Kal-El, his father (Jor-El) and mother sending him to earth because their home planet of Krypton was crumbling, and that Clark can only be killed by Kryptonite, fragments of rock from his home planet.With this knowledge as I watched the pilot episode of Smallville, I expected (because of its WB, teen-themed roots) to see a sappy show filled with teen angst.  However, while viewing the pilot episode, I had a wakeup call.  What I saw was an everyday Kansas farmboy (with an affinity for plaid shirts) who just happened to be able to lift farm equipment with one arm...Smallville Season One introduces main players Clark Kent, Ma and Pa Kent, and Lana Lang, as well as young business mogul Lex Luthor.  Other characters are introduced and fleshed-out, including Lionel Luthor (Lex's father), Chloe Sullivan, and Pete Ross.  The show's premise is that each week a different person is affected by the meteor rocks that rained from the sky when Clark was sent to earth.  The rocks prey on a person's deepest fears or desires, giving that person super-human abilities.  Only high-schooler Clark Kent is able to combat them.The show has a great plot and great special effects, but it is the character developement that makes the show an all-time great.  Over the course of Season One, Chloe and Pete go from third wheels to integral parts of the story.  Clark begins developing new powers and dealing with the responsibilities that come with them.  The give-and-take between Lex and Lionel Luthor is reason enough to watch!In conclusion, Smallville is a show that can be watched by anyone.  I (20 years old) was introduced to it by my 10th grade sister, and now my Dad even watches the show.  For those of you who like to classify the show, it is a combination of The X-Files (paranormal stuff and government intrigue), The Wonder Years (the relationship difficulties of high schoolers) and The Waltons (watching the Kents try to preserve their family values).  As you watch Season One, you will realize that the episodes just keeping getting better and better.
