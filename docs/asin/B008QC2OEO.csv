Like the film ""Frontier(s)"", a group of friends take refuge in a family owned inn after being so kind to give a dansel in distress a lift home, then well, if you've seen ""Frontier(s)"" then you know what happens from there. By all means, don't think that this is a rip-off of the French film as this has it's own story and plot. This is a great horror film in it's own right. What's so delicious about this film is that it was done so well from a country I would never think that could do such a great job. Normally, this genre of asian horror is reigned by Japan, South Korea, China, and Thailand. So coming from the small market of Indonesia, this is a hidden little gem not to be missed.",5,Kindness Can Lead You Straight To Hell,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,782,"['Indonesia', 'answer', 'great', 'French', 'film', 'Frontier', 'all-out', 'slaughter-fest', 'frenzy', 'film', 'Frontier', 'group', 'friends', 'take', 'refuge', 'family', 'owned', 'inn', 'being', 'so', 'kind', 'give', 'dansel', 'distress', 'lift', 'home', 'then', 'well', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Frontier', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'there', 'means', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'rip-off', 'French', 'film', 'own', 'story', 'plot', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'What', 'so', 'delicious', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'country', 'would', 'never', 'think', 'could', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'Normally', 'genre', 'asian', 'horror', 'reigned', 'Japan', 'South', 'Korea', 'China', 'Thailand', 'So', 'coming', 'small', 'market', 'Indonesia', 'hidden', 'little', 'gem', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

1574249,A1JRW2CDU51UEL,B008QC2OEO,Rick Moore,"[0, 0]","Macabre aka Rumah Dara really took me by surprise in that it not only lived up to but far exceeded all the hype. I'd heard a lot about the Indonesian gorefest the last couple of years (the movie was made in 2009) and got excited when Bloody Disgusting Selects announced they had picked it up for US distribution. However, unless anything has changed between me writing this review and now, inexplicably BD have still yet to release Macabre stateside. What's being sold here is the region one Canadian dvd release, and if it's still going at under ten dollars it really is a steal and I'd recommend you pick it up without any further hesitation. Even at twice the price, you'll still be getting your money's worth. Macabre/Darah is the sort of movie you'll want to tell people about, a great movie to watch with a crowd or alone, and one that warrants multiple viewings. It's not that it breaks the mold particularly - really how many horror movies these day really do? - but that it succeeds with what it sets out to deliver. If you liked Inside, Frontiers, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn and others of their ilk you won't be disappointed. Once the movie gets going, its pretty much a non-stop rollercoaster right to the end. Chief amongst its many strengths is the movie's iconic central villain, a genuinely creepy turn by Shareefa Daanish as Darah (see cover). And while everything about the production is strong, special mention should also go to the movie's other star, the visual effects (or maybe that should be visceral effects) of make-up artist Alexey Petryaev.

1574250,A3BT78P0UT2Z5F,B008QC2OEO,The Brock Lesnar of Reviewing - The Most Hated,"[0, 0]","I heard about this movie awhile ago on bloody-disgusting.com but have never seen much else about it. The reviews here on amazon aren't very helpful either, still I've seen ""V/H/S 2 (Watch Now Before It's In Theaters)"" and ""The ABC's of Death"" and found that Timo Tjahjantos contributions to both films were my absolute favorite parts of those movies. Sooooo, I said to hell with it and threw it in my cart, 2 days later it arrived! ""Macabre"" is a gorefest which felt like it had elements of ""Frontier(s)"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Inside (Unrated)"", and ""House of 1000 Corpses"" all rolled into it.It's definitely nice considering a few of those films are some of my all time favorites.A Group of friends come across a young woman stuck in the rain and decide to give her a ride home. Upon arrival she invites them in to meet her mother who offers to cook them dinner for helping her daughter. Soon they realize all's not as it seems and are forced to fight for their lives or end up somebodies main course!The thing about ""Macabre"" is it doesn't do anything new, anything different. Not that its a bad thing though because ""Macabre"" is a great horror film but it would have been nice for something new. There really isn't much to complain about except for some weak acting and a few bad decisions but nothing that can really derail it. The effects are top notch and the gore is plentiful which is nice, its just that most kills are generic. Regardless, if you love gore and are in need of a fix an don't mind subtitles, do yourself a favor and grab a copy of ""Macabre"", in the end you'll be satisfied.",4,"""An Asian Homage to Gore""",1372377600,"06 28, 2013",2013,1608,"['heard', 'movie', 'awhile', 'ago', 'bloody-disgusting.com', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'much', 'else', 'reviews', 'here', 'amazon', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'helpful', 'still', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'V/H/S', '2', 'Watch', 'Now', 'Theaters', 'ABC', 'Death', 'found', 'Timo', 'Tjahjantos', 'contributions', 'films', 'were', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movies', 'Sooooo', 'said', 'hell', 'threw', 'cart', '2', 'days', 'later', 'arrived', 'Macabre', 'gorefest', 'felt', 'had', 'elements', 'Frontier', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Inside', 'Unrated', 'House', '1000', 'Corpses', 'rolled', 'it.It', 'definitely', 'nice', 'considering', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'time', 'favorites.A', 'Group', 'friends', 'come', 'young', 'woman', 'stuck', 'rain', 'decide', 'give', 'ride', 'home', 'arrival', 'meet', 'mother', 'who', 'cook', 'dinner', 'helping', 'daughter', 'Soon', 'realize', 'not', 'are', 'forced', 'fight', 'lives', 'end', 'up', 'somebodies', 'main', 'course', 'thing', 'Macabre', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'new', 'anything', 'different', 'Not', 'bad', 'thing', 'Macabre', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'something', 'new', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'complain', 'weak', 'acting', 'few', 'bad', 'decisions', 'nothing', 'can', 'really', 'derail', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'gore', 'plentiful', 'nice', 'just', 'most', 'kills', 'are', 'generic', 'Regardless', 'love', 'gore', 'are', 'need', 'fix', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'subtitles', 'do', 'favor', 'grab', 'copy', 'Macabre', 'end', ""'ll"", 'be', 'satisfied']",N/A
