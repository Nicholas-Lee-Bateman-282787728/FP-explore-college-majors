I was a bit bummed that the soundtrack wasn't as good as the movie. Several songs deviated from the sound of the original version but some were the same so it balanced out. The two stars falling in love while not even sure if they like each other as people was a good idea. She hates him because she doesn't know him and thinks he is just another self-obsessed young star. He tries his best to win her over with his charm and looks only to find out that is not enough for her, in fact, she is not even impressed by his charm, title or fame. She is so set against liking him that she finds if she removes the false front there lies an honest-to-goodness great guy.",5,Opposites attract even in Disney movies,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,778,"['was', 'movie', 'watched', 'over', 'over', 'songs', 'was', 'glad', 'get', 'soundtrack', 'included', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'bummed', 'soundtrack', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'Several', 'songs', 'deviated', 'sound', 'original', 'version', 'were', 'same', 'balanced', 'out', 'two', 'stars', 'falling', 'love', 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'like', 'other', 'people', 'was', 'good', 'idea', ""n't"", 'know', 'thinks', 'just', 'self-obsessed', 'young', 'star', 'best', 'win', 'charm', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'enough', 'fact', 'not', 'even', 'impressed', 'charm', 'title', 'fame', 'so', 'set', 'liking', 'false', 'front', 'honest-to-goodness', 'great', 'guy']",N/A

I saw the trailer Starstruck and was immediately excited. I love Sonny With a Chance and was excited to see Sterling Knight in something else as well. Plus some of the music previewed sounded good. I looked forward to the first airing. I'll start by saying I did like the movie and I will buy it on DVD. HOWEVER, I'm not sure if it was how the character of Jessica was written or the way the girl acted it but DANG she annoyed me. She was far too high and mighty like she never did anything wrong and he was always the problem. I think perhaps the problem was both the writing at the acting. There was inconsistency because her excessive hate of him never seemed justified until his real indiscretion of denying knowing her. Before that they never gave us a reason that she hated him so much even after she admitted she liked his music just not him. What did she really know about him that justified it? Also, they showed that he was a pretty cool guy because his friendships were so important to him yet she tries to say he barely knows the people he works with. And the whole problem with Paparazzi. She kept accusing him of seeking them out when the whole time he's actually running from him and it's his girlfriend who's the diva. It just drove me crazy how they couldn't justify her hatred of him.

1335145,AS5DZ7COE84B5,B003B1X85O,"Dan-Fabian Parra ""the dude""","[12, 14]","""StarStruck"", the latest flick from Disney Channel, is a polished and tween-adjusted product for the hardcore Disney Channel fan base and a perfect film to its target group. While its not the very best original movie that I've seen from Disney Channel, it still makes a decent and passable watch to pass 90 minutes with.It seems as Disney loves to milk the concept about pop stars connecting with the ""real world"", something that they've tried on ""Hannah Montana"", ""Camp Rock"" and now ""Starstruck"". Not that the concept is specifically worn out, but it has been used a couple of times to make the concept absent of any surprises or plot twists. ""Starstruck"" follows the same pattern and delivers a quite predictable story, without any innovative twists and turns (not that its ought to be expected by a TV movie, though). However, despite that and a few unsolved subplots, the film delivers a sincere and sweet love story, which actually works and comes off as believable.Sterling Knight (""17 Again"", ""Sonny With a Chance"") is spunky and charming as the pop star Christopher Wilde. The beautiful Danielle Campbell is passable in her role as the girl lead, Jessica Olsen and does look distractingly young compared to Knight (according to sources, she was fourteen during the filming). Although she's been given a less compelling part, she does pull some emotional moments quite well. Brandon Mychal Smith (""Phil of the Future"", ""Sonny With a Chance"") is likeable as Chris' friend Stubby, while Maggie Castle is quite convincingly annoying as the Jessica's sister Sara, which is obsessed with Chris Wilde. However, its a pity that the likeable Chelsea Stub (""JONAS"") has been given a rather thankless role.The music, however, is the component on the film which disappoints a bit. Former Disney concepts as ""High School Musical"", ""Hannah Montana"" and ""Camp Rock"" has included catchy and enjoyable songs, the music of ""StarStruck"" is passable, but rather generic. Perhaps its time for Disney to hire some new songwriters/musicians for their films?Overall, ""StarStruck"" may not be the greatest teen movie of all time, but its a cute, watchable movie  on its own merit and delivers a cute, emotional love story.

1335148,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003B1X85O,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","With the success of Disney original movies such as the ""High School Musical"", ""Camp Rock"", ""Princess Protection Program"" and""Wizard of Waverly Place - The Movie"", these films have literally been ratings gold for the Disney Channel.  And this time around, Disney tries to repeat their TV movie success with ""StarStruck"" starring ""Sonny with a Chance"" actor Sterling Knight, ""Prison Break"" actress Danielle Campbell, ""Sonny with a Chance"" actor Brandon Mychal Smith and ""JONAS"" actress Chelsea Staub.""StarStruck"" is directed by Michael Grossman ""Dirty Sexy Money"", ""Zoey 101', ""Grey's Anatomy"") and a teleplay by Barbara Johns and Annie DeYoung (""Prison Protection Program"", ""The Ron Clark Story"").The film debut on the Disney Channel in Feb. 2010 and was #1 in its time slot with kids ages 6-11 and tweens ages 19-14 and was the most watched February original movie premiere in total viewers and now the film will be released on DVD via a original edition and an extended edition which comes with the movie soundtrack and also an extended musical scene for the song ""Got to Believe"".""StarStruck"" revolves around popular pop star Christopher Wilde (played by Sterling Knight).  Always constantly stalked by the paparazzi, Christopher is told that if he wants to be in his first Hollywood movie, he has to stop attracting attention from the paparazzi and show that he is serious about his work.  The problem is that despite his best friend Stubby (played by Brandon Miychal Smith) trying to keep him out of trouble, his actress girlfriend Alexis (played by Chelsea Staub) loves the attention from the paparazzi and is good at leaking information of locations where she will be spotted with Christopher.But Christopher's manager parents have ordered him to stay home in order to avoid the paparazzi but with Alexis's birthday party coming up, she's expecting him to show up.Meanwhile, all the way in Michigan is the Olson family who are planning to visit Los Angeles in order to visit Grandma Olson.  Sara (played by Maggie Castle) is the biggest Christopher Wilde fan and her younger sister Jessica could care less about him.  But Sara looks at this opportunity to be in Hollywood and meet up with Christopher and get pictures and an autograph for the fan club.All seems good in Los Angeles as Sara receives information that Christopher will be showing up at Alexis' birthday party and wants to be there but she is forced by her parents to bring her younger sister Jessica along.  As Christopher manages to make a quick performance at Alexis' birthday party at the club and avoid the paparazzi, as he is trying to make a quick getaway in the alley, while opening the door, he accidentally knocks Jessica in the head accidentally.  Afraid that the paparazzi are after him, he quickly helps Alexis to the doctor and takes her home.The following day, as Christopher tries to stay away from paparazzi, as Sara and Jessica go to the beach, once again Jessica meets Christopher and because of the paparazzi, must spend the day together and thus Christopher and Jessica spend time together as he shows her all around Los Angeles.  But Christopher finds himself attracted to Jessica because she is the first person who is not attracted to his star personality, him being a celebrity and not starstruck at all. And despite not liking Christopher the pop star, she finds herself enjoying time with Christopher Wilde, the normal guy.But as the two share an outdoor adventure trying to dodge paparazzi, the adventure brings the two together much closers than they ever expected but because she's a normal girl and he is a star, Christopher knows that he can't let the paparazzi invading her privacy and the only way to do that is by hurting her and pretending he never met her.  But unbeknownst to both Chris and Jessica, the paparazzi have shot photos of them together already and now Jessica finds out for herself how life is for Christopher when she is stalked by the paparazzi.As for the ""StarStruck"" CD soundtrack, the following tracks are included on the CD:1. StarStruck - Christopher Wilde2. Shades - Christopher Wilde3. Hero - Christopher Wilde & Stubby4. Something About the Sunshine - Christopher Wilde & Anna Margaret5. What You Mean to Me - Christopher Wilde6. Party Up - Stubby7. Got to Believe - Christopher Wilde8. Hero (Unplugged) - Christopher Wilde & Stubby9. Something about the Sunshine - Anna Margaret10. New Boyfriend - Anna Margaret11. Welcome to Hollywood - Mitchel Musso12. Make a Movie - Jasmine SagginarioVIDEO:""StarStruck"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1).  For the most part, picture quality is good for DVD but as expected for a DVD release, you can see a bit of compression and also aliasing.  But for the most part, for most young viewers, this is a non-issue for a DVD release.AUDIO:""StarStruck"" is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound with French and Spanish language tracks.  The audio is clear through the front and center channels and with the film utilizing music, the audio quality is good for a Disney film on DVD.  I didn't notice any major surround usage but for a film such as ""StarStruck"", the soundtrack is appropriate and overall good.SPECIAL FEATURES:""StarStruck - Extended Edition"" comes with the following special features:* Rock Along - While watching the film, you can watch it with karaoke style subtitles for the music portion of the film.* Music Videos - The DVD contains three music videos: ""StarStruck"" by Christopher Wilde, ""Something about the Sunshine"" by Anna Margaret and ""Party Up"" by Stubby.EXTRAS:""StarStruck - Extended Edition"" comes with a slip cover case.JUDGMENT CALL:""StarStruck"" is an enjoyable, charming and a pretty entertaining Disney original film.  I've seen Sterling Knight's work on ""Sonny with a Chance"" and it's my first time watching Danielle Campbell but overall, the two have good chemistry onscreen and I was quite impressed by the Knight's vocals (as well as the hip hop track by Brandon Mychal Smith).It has a similar charm to other previous Disney original films, fun in terms of storyline with the quirky situations (and of course, some situations are a bit farfetched) but I was entertained.  Sterling Knight is definitely showing his versatility as an actor and also as a vocalist.  I didn't know he could sing but he did a solid job and definitely an up-and-coming Disney star who definitely has the potential to becoming a much bigger star.Danielle Campbell also brings something new, similar to how Demi Lovato brought that fresh face and talent to ""Camp Rock"" and even like Selena Gomez when she first began making her appearance on ""Hannah Montana"" and ""The Suite Life of Zack and Cody"", so I guess we'll see if she will be making more Disney appearances in the near future.If anything, the film is a fun teen and children's film and parents looking for a safe, music-driven Disney film will definitely find ""StarStruck - The Extended Edition"" to be a solid release with the DVD movie and the music soundtrack included.  Granted, for parents wanting to know if it's ""really safe"", well, you don't want your daughters walking through Hollywood especially alone at an alley late at night (which is how the two main characters meet) but despite that one scene (well, there is one other scene in which the two drive a car into quicksand but I doubt any teenagers will have to worry about that), the film is quite safe and really, there is nothing to worry about in terms of content.Overall, ""StarStruck"" is an entertaining film.  And if you really enjoyed the film on television, especially the music, definitely pickup the ""StarStruck - Extended Edition"" for the musical soundtrack and the extended scene.",4,"A charming,

1335151,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B003B1X85O,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[0, 0]","We recently watched a classic episode of the iconic TV series That Girl in which Ann and Donald go on a car trip to meet her parents and encounter comical mishaps along the way. It was carried off brilliantly, in the tradition of film and TV buddy/road comedies that feature a bickering couple. It worked on That Girl and it worked to legendary proportions in It Happened One Night.It also works, Disney Channel style, in StarStruck, a romantic comedy with pop music starring Sterling Knight of the Channel's series Sonny With a Chance and Danielle Campbell of Disney XD's Zeke and Luther.The basic story is another wish fulfillment tale for youngsters: a young girl accidentally meets a rock star. There's a fair amount of misunderstanding and teen angst, but the heart of the film is the ""two for the road"" sequence in which the two stars share mishaps and begin to care for each other. It's surefire when you have a duo with chemistry. Fortunately these two have it.Campbell is a capable young actress with a lot of potential as a lead who can clearly carry a film, but Knight steals every scene in a role that he apparently won by default (he replaced the errant Cody Lynley). Knight -- who revealed in a Bonnie Hunt Show interview that he got his name from Disney and Hollywood legend Sterling Holloway -- has a true flair for playing the spoiled jerk who you can't dislike, a knowing self-parody of the pretty boy showbiz idol. As he does on Sonny With a Chance, Knight makes the comedy count in a way reminiscent of Michael J. Fox when he became the center of Family Ties. It will be interesting to see where his talent takes him,The songs are, of course, loaded with appealing hooks that cement them into your head as they were skillfully designed to do. And it's also worth mentioning that the score was by David Lawrence, who also did the High School Musical films and is the son of Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorm&eacute;.The DVD is available with or without a CD soundtrack (a nice option) but is not overloaded with extras other than a few music videos.

It's a Disney flick that should charm its pre-teen viewers with its dose of wholesome. The two young leads - Sterling Knight and Danielle Campbell - carry the load. It's a cinch that the target audience will forgive the cliches peppering this tale of a pop star teen idol struggling for a measure of normalcy in his crazy Hollywood life. Parents ought not to have problems with their kids parking themselves on the couch to watch this film. I've seen worse teen flicks, and STARSTRUCK is actually better than most.A level-headed teen from Michigan, Jessica Olson (Danielle Campbell) has to visit her grandma in Los Angeles, but she's not at all enamored with the holiday trip. Not as gaga, anyway, as her older sister, what's her face, who proclaims herself the number one fan of teen pop sensation Christopher Wilde (Sterling Knight). But it's Jessica who accidentally bumps into Christopher Wilde, and it's Jessica whom Christopher hangs out with for an evening and a day, as they dodge paparazzis, see the sights, all along squabbling and sniping and inevitably falling for each other. See? Tale as old as whatever...It takes a lot to impress Jessica, and Christopher's celebrity status and whining about the paparazzis only maker her roll her eyes. But Christopher is a pretty good dude and flashes those blue eyes, and Jessica isn't a robot. But reality steps in, or reality as it is in Hollywood, anyway, and it drives these two apart. Will Christopher, who is so not in control of his life that he can't ever say no to anyone, let a good thing slip away? Jessica just wants him to be honest. It kills her that Christopher is so mired in his larger-than-life existence, so oblivious about the things that really matter. Christopher thinks he's protecting her from the media, plus there's this notion that his being seen hanging out with an ordinary girl would ruin his chances at a movie deal. Both Jessica and Christopher kind of have a point (that is, regarding Christopher's trying to protect Jessica's privacy; the not wanting to be seen with her because of the movie thing is kind of a jerk move). But this is a Disney movie, where sad endings don't exist unless you're a dog with rabies. The story's climax allows our pining protagonists to make up in glorious Disney fashion, and it takes place in a *gasp* high school dance. I know, right? This has absolutely never been done before.There's a chance that Danielle Campbell may have been just a tad too cranky, but I don't think her witchiness will turn off the audience. She and Knight have a spark together, and this really is what makes this movie so watchable. The songs are whatever, although Sterling does deliver that terrific acoustical performance by the pool at the party. Brandon Mychal Smith, Knight's SONNY WITH A CHANCE co-star, provides some chuckles and dude even raps some and his flow is tight. I'm swayed to rate this film 3.5 out of 5 stars.This is the Extended Edition and here's the bonus material that's relevant to the film: the exclusive extended music scene - featuring the song ""Got to Believe""; 3 music videos: Sterling Knight's ""StarStruck"", Anna Margaret's ""Something About the Sunshine""; Stubby's ""Party Up""; and ""Rock Along"" - an option on the DVD which allows you to sing along as the song lyrics pop up karaoke-style during the film's musical performances.",4,"""You killed Petunia!""",1289174400,"11 8, 2010",2010,3434,"['STARSTRUCK', 'tale', 'as', 'old', 'time', 'song', 'as', 'old', 'rhyme', 'jazz', 'Disney', 'flick', 'should', 'charm', 'pre-teen', 'viewers', 'dose', 'wholesome', 'two', 'young', 'Sterling', 'Knight', 'Danielle', 'Campbell', 'carry', 'load', 'cinch', 'target', 'audience', 'will', 'forgive', 'cliches', 'peppering', 'tale', 'pop', 'star', 'teen', 'idol', 'struggling', 'measure', 'normalcy', 'crazy', 'Hollywood', 'life', 'Parents', 'ought', 'not', 'have', 'problems', 'kids', 'parking', 'couch', 'watch', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'teen', 'flicks', 'STARSTRUCK', 'actually', 'better', 'most.A', 'level-headed', 'teen', 'Michigan', 'Jessica', 'Olson', 'Danielle', 'Campbell', 'visit', 'grandma', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'not', 'enamored', 'holiday', 'trip', 'Not', 'gaga', 'anyway', 'older', 'sister', 'what', 'face', 'who', 'number', 'one', 'fan', 'teen', 'pop', 'sensation', 'Christopher', 'Wilde', 'Sterling', 'Knight', 'Jessica', 'who', 'accidentally', 'bumps', 'Christopher', 'Wilde', 'Jessica', 'whom', 'Christopher', 'out', 'evening', 'day', 'dodge', 'paparazzis', 'see', 'sights', 'squabbling', 'sniping', 'inevitably', 'falling', 'other', 'See', 'Tale', 'as', 'old', 'lot', 'impress', 'Jessica', 'Christopher', 'celebrity', 'status', 'whining', 'paparazzis', 'only', 'maker', 'roll', 'eyes', 'Christopher', 'pretty', 'good', 'dude', 'flashes', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Jessica', ""n't"", 'robot', 'reality', 'steps', 'reality', 'Hollywood', 'anyway', 'two', 'apart', 'Will', 'Christopher', 'who', 'so', 'not', 'control', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'say', 'no', 'anyone', 'let', 'good', 'thing', 'slip', 'away', 'Jessica', 'just', 'be', 'honest', 'Christopher', 'so', 'mired', 'larger-than-life', 'existence', 'so', 'oblivious', 'things', 'really', 'matter', 'Christopher', 'protecting', 'media', 'notion', 'being', 'seen', 'hanging', 'out', 'ordinary', 'girl', 'would', 'ruin', 'chances', 'movie', 'deal', 'Jessica', 'Christopher', 'kind', 'have', 'point', 'regarding', 'Christopher', 'trying', 'protect', 'Jessica', 'privacy', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'seen', 'because', 'movie', 'thing', 'kind', 'jerk', 'move', 'Disney', 'movie', 'where', 'sad', 'endings', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', ""'re"", 'dog', 'rabies', 'story', 'climax', 'pining', 'protagonists', 'make', 'up', 'glorious', 'Disney', 'fashion', 'place', '*gasp*', 'high', 'school', 'dance', 'know', 'right', 'absolutely', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'chance', 'Danielle', 'Campbell', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'tad', 'too', 'cranky', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'witchiness', 'will', 'turn', 'off', 'audience', 'Knight', 'have', 'spark', 'together', 'really', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'watchable', 'songs', 'are', 'whatever', 'Sterling', 'deliver', 'terrific', 'acoustical', 'performance', 'pool', 'party', 'Brandon', 'Mychal', 'Smith', 'Knight', 'SONNY', 'WITH', 'A', 'CHANCE', 'co-star', 'chuckles', 'dude', 'even', 'raps', 'flow', 'tight', ""'m"", 'swayed', 'rate', 'film', '3.5', '5', 'stars.This', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'here', 'bonus', 'material', 'relevant', 'film', 'exclusive', 'extended', 'music', 'scene', 'featuring', 'song', 'Got', 'Believe', '3', 'music', 'videos', 'Sterling', 'Knight', 'StarStruck', 'Anna', 'Margaret', 'Something', 'Sunshine', 'Stubby', 'Party', 'Up', 'Rock', 'Along', 'option', 'DVD', 'sing', 'along', 'song', 'lyrics', 'pop', 'up', 'karaoke-style', 'film', 'musical', 'performances']",N/A

The movie plays out in Hollywood, California area, the tour of the senic places which included the beach was great as some viewers may never get to see it in person was a plus.It shows not everyone will overlook rudeness and superficial friendliness to let you be their close friend. Sometimes it takes superstar action of young people to find the acceptance of others, in a truthful loving and caring special way.  Someone has to be strong enough to call you on your actions towards them and others.  One can't buy true friends with money and gifts, how shallow that is - but it does reflect on what kind of person you choose to be.This movie shows families in different lights.  Grandparents are in an inter-racial relationship.  Parents are dealing with teen dynamics of sibbling warfare that goes to the extreme between daughters likes, issues, and solutions of each.Do each of the girls eventually gets their wishes fulfilled?  Does the oldest get to meet her star and adore him like a true fan?  Does the younger daughter find a true friend and does her wish get fulfill, too?  Does the Star find a loving working relationship with his parents, agents, fans, friends?  Does he accept his parents actions managing his career or how does he chose to handle it?  Is there a better way to attack his career issues to reach a happier, calmer place that will give him some space to grow as a person?Are your parents necessary to help you stay safe and grounded in a high stress career?  However, they too can lose site of the direction of a childs career which seems to have happen with these parents.  Does it work out for everyone in a healthier and happier relationships?

Think ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!"" (2004) minus that film's PG elements.At its core it is another fairy tale as Kalamazoo teenager Jessica Olsen (nicely played by Danielle Campbell) visits Hollywood and accidentally meets mega-star teen heartthrob Christopher Wilde (Sterling Knight). Knight is joined by his ""Sonny With A Chance"" cast-mate Brandon Mychal Smith.The secret of this type of fairy tale lies in how well they connect with viewers; if the movie can get viewers to strongly identify with the character as she gets a huge rush from suddenly becoming part of the celebrity world, the viewer will get hooked. Then the challenge is to keep them hooked for as long as possible. ""Starstruck"" hooks you and provides this vicarious rush well past the midway point, in large part because of the twist of having Jessica rather under-whelmed by the circumstances. But eventually the wheels fall off, or in this case sink into an unlikely mud hole. The illusion bursts and everyone crashes back to reality because it is impossible to suspend disbelief when the AMC Pacer (Petunia) sinks into the mire. From that point on it is just overwrought melodrama until the movie finally recovers and goes out on a very nice reconciliation sequence.Chelsea Staub is again unsuccessful at playing a mean girl (remember the ""Bratz"" disaster). Too much natural likability, you would think they would have figured this out by now.Maggie Castle does a good job as Jessica's older sister Sara, who throughout most of the film is far more into Chad than is Jessica. Abbie Cobb plays Sara's friend AJ. If imitation is really the sincerest form of flattery, then Kay Panabaker should feel real good these days; as Cobb joins Bridgit Mendler and Meaghan Jett Martin (who can successfully play a mean girl) as yet another of Disney's bleached out Panabaker wannabe clones.Then again, what do I know?
