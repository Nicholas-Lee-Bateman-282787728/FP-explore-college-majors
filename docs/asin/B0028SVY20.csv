1256147,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B0028SVY20,Bobby Underwood,"[40, 40]","Early Edition was one of the most interesting and entertaining hours on television during its run and after picking up season one, it's nice to see the second season of this fabulous show coming out. The characters were likable, and all too human at times, making them even more likable. Kyle Chandler proved the perfect choice as a regular guy with foibles who at first tries to cash in like any of us would on his good fortune, then realizes the great responsibility which has been laid at his door, quite literally.Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler) has been kicked out by his wife and forced to find a hotel. A yellow cat accompanies a newspaper which Gary eventually discovers is quite special. It is tomorrow's news today, and day after day it is delivered to Gary's door. He reacts as most of us would at first but his good nature finally takes over and he realizes there is a reason he's been chosen to receive the paper.What followed each week was fabulous. One week it was humorous and the next heartbreaking. Shanesia Williams was terrific as his blind pal Marissa, who tried to keep him grounded and lead him towards the right path when the direction seemed unclear. Fisher Stevens was perfectly cast as his pal Chuck, who wanted to take advantage of Gary's windfall but often ended up helping him instead because deep down he was a good guy. It was sort of like Rockford and Angel, just less pronounced. At least in season one.What helped to make the show special was the Chicago atmosphere and some tightly written shows about delicate choices made from the heart, some of which had grave consequences. The moral dilemmas continued, as in Quality of Mercy. In this episode, Gary saves someone, only to read the ""next"" paper, and discover that person is now going to kill someone innocent. There was always so much day to day slice of life humor in this show that you bonded with the characters in a way we don't anymore. The drama was human also, particularly so in The Medal, where a Vietnam Vet is racked with guilt.The affection the writers had for classic movies came across to a great degree in season two. In Romancing the Throne, a Princess from Morania takes a break from her duties with Gary and helps save a couple of lives. It is obviously an homage to Roman Holiday. Where or When takes a page from Hitchcock's Rear Window, as Gary is laid up with a broken leg, and becomes tangled up with what may be a 50 year old murder just across the way. A Bris is Just a Bris is an obvious nod to A Kiss is Just a Kiss from Casablanca, even if the amusing story-line where Chuck starts telling the truth (gulp) and Gary gets tangled up with a klutzy librarian have little in common with the classic film. Anyone who's seen In Old Chicago with Tyrone Power and Alice faye will enjoy Hot Time in the Old Town, in which Gary wakes up two days before the great Chicago fire after a bump on the head!The show's characters and their interactions had a very real feel and each show had its share of fine moments. Often mixed with humor, but sometimes quite poignant in the end, each week was special. From late September of 1997 to late May of 1998 fans of this show relished the hour spent each week with Gary and his pals.Season two episodes include: Home--The Medal--The Wedding--Jenny Sloan--Down Sized--Angels and Devils--Redfellas--March in Time--A Regular Joe--A Bris is Just a Bris--A Minor Miracle--Romancing the Throne--Walk, Don't Run--Return of Crumb--Mum's the Word--When and Where--The Fourth Carpathian--The Quality of Mercy--Show Me the Monet--Don't Walk Away Renee-Hot Time in the Old Town--Second SightHaving purchased season one for someone I love I'm glad season two is now on its way. Early Edition truly stands out as something of quality. Gary and his friends, and that mysterious yellow cat, were welcome visitors each week and this is another fantastic release for the show's many fans.",5,A Cool Show Returns !,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,3913,"['Early', 'Edition', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'hours', 'television', 'run', 'picking', 'up', 'season', 'one', 'nice', 'see', 'second', 'season', 'fabulous', 'show', 'coming', 'out', 'characters', 'were', 'likable', 'too', 'human', 'times', 'making', 'even', 'more', 'likable', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'proved', 'perfect', 'choice', 'regular', 'guy', 'foibles', 'who', 'first', 'tries', 'cash', 'would', 'good', 'fortune', 'then', 'great', 'responsibility', 'been', 'laid', 'door', 'quite', 'literally.Gary', 'Hobson', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'been', 'kicked', 'out', 'wife', 'forced', 'find', 'hotel', 'yellow', 'cat', 'newspaper', 'Gary', 'eventually', 'quite', 'special', 'tomorrow', 'news', 'today', 'day', 'day', 'delivered', 'Gary', 'door', 'most', 'would', 'first', 'good', 'nature', 'finally', 'reason', 'been', 'chosen', 'receive', 'paper.What', 'followed', 'week', 'was', 'fabulous', 'One', 'week', 'was', 'humorous', 'next', 'heartbreaking', 'Shanesia', 'Williams', 'was', 'terrific', 'blind', 'pal', 'Marissa', 'who', 'tried', 'keep', 'grounded', 'lead', 'towards', 'right', 'path', 'when', 'direction', 'seemed', 'unclear', 'Fisher', 'Stevens', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'pal', 'Chuck', 'who', 'wanted', 'take', 'advantage', 'Gary', 'windfall', 'often', 'ended', 'up', 'helping', 'instead', 'deep', 'was', 'good', 'guy', 'was', 'sort', 'Rockford', 'Angel', 'just', 'less', 'pronounced', 'least', 'season', 'one.What', 'helped', 'make', 'show', 'special', 'was', 'Chicago', 'atmosphere', 'tightly', 'written', 'delicate', 'choices', 'made', 'heart', 'had', 'grave', 'consequences', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'continued', 'Quality', 'Mercy', 'episode', 'Gary', 'someone', 'only', 'read', 'next', 'paper', 'discover', 'person', 'now', 'going', 'kill', 'someone', 'innocent', 'was', 'always', 'so', 'much', 'day', 'day', 'slice', 'life', 'humor', 'show', 'bonded', 'characters', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'anymore', 'drama', 'was', 'human', 'also', 'particularly', 'so', 'Medal', 'where', 'Vietnam', 'Vet', 'racked', 'guilt.The', 'affection', 'writers', 'had', 'classic', 'movies', 'came', 'great', 'degree', 'season', 'two', 'Romancing', 'Throne', 'Princess', 'Morania', 'break', 'duties', 'Gary', 'save', 'couple', 'lives', 'obviously', 'homage', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'Where', 'When', 'page', 'Hitchcock', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Gary', 'laid', 'up', 'broken', 'leg', 'becomes', 'tangled', 'up', 'what', 'may', 'be', '50', 'year', 'old', 'murder', 'just', 'way', 'Bris', 'Just', 'Bris', 'obvious', 'nod', 'Kiss', 'Just', 'Kiss', 'Casablanca', 'even', 'amusing', 'story-line', 'where', 'Chuck', 'telling', 'truth', 'gulp', 'Gary', 'tangled', 'up', 'klutzy', 'librarian', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'classic', 'film', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Old', 'Chicago', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'Alice', 'faye', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Hot', 'Time', 'Old', 'Town', 'Gary', 'up', 'two', 'days', 'great', 'Chicago', 'fire', 'bump', 'head', 'show', 'characters', 'interactions', 'had', 'very', 'real', 'feel', 'show', 'had', 'share', 'fine', 'moments', 'Often', 'mixed', 'humor', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'poignant', 'end', 'week', 'was', 'special', 'late', 'September', '1997', 'late', 'May', '1998', 'fans', 'show', 'relished', 'hour', 'spent', 'week', 'Gary', 'pals.Season', 'two', 'episodes', 'include', 'Home', 'Medal', 'Wedding', 'Jenny', 'Sloan', 'Down', 'Sized', 'Angels', 'Devils', 'Redfellas', 'March', 'Time', 'Regular', 'Joe', 'Bris', 'Just', 'Bris', 'Minor', 'Miracle', 'Romancing', 'Throne', 'Walk', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Run', 'Return', 'Crumb', 'Mum', 'Word', 'When', 'Where', 'Fourth', 'Carpathian', 'Quality', 'Mercy', 'Show', 'Me', 'Monet', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Walk', 'Away', 'Renee-Hot', 'Time', 'Old', 'Town', 'Second', 'SightHaving', 'purchased', 'season', 'one', 'someone', 'love', ""'m"", 'glad', 'season', 'two', 'now', 'way', 'Early', 'Edition', 'truly', 'out', 'something', 'quality', 'Gary', 'friends', 'mysterious', 'yellow', 'cat', 'were', 'welcome', 'visitors', 'week', 'fantastic', 'release', 'show', 'many', 'fans']",Early Edition: Season 2

As I stated before Leave as is CBS, if it takes alittle longer to release the second or any other seasons, we the fans we'll understand and will wait, we don't want a shoddy product with music or scenes removed or missing. We want an excellent DVD Release Of Early Edition Seasons Like this First Season Release, which is Excellent, so please Leave, as is CBS. Release the Seasons like we saw them on TV Please.

1256149,A2ASR649JS6EYP,B0028SVY20,"Chicago to DC to the boonies ""pcbryan4""","[3, 3]","I nearly didn't make it through this season set because the first two discs contained weak episodes with too much sap and movie-of-the-week type topical stories.  Please.  I couldn't understand how I'd watched the entire series originally if it had gone this soft-headed in season two.  Fortunately I stuck with it and was rewarded in the last three discs with episodes that went back to, and often outdid, the strengths of season 1.  Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler)--the protagonist who gets tomorrow's Chicago Sun-Times today--is not a sap.  He tries to do his best and won't turn his back on those who he feels need him, but he is not entirely a willing hero, and he isn't too surprised when his help isn't welcomed.  Even more skeptical is his friend and co-worker Chuck (Fisher Stevens), who along with co-workers Marissa and ex-detective Crumb, helps to ground and expand the focus of the show.  After the first two discs, the show's humor returns, particular in the wonderful ""The Fourth Carpathian"" in which four Carpathian brothers, Crumb, and Gary's parents are featured in an episode that is light-hearted but still full of heart.  As Crumb says ""someone or something is watching over Gary"" and I appreciate that whoever is sending the newspaper is kept cryptic.  The first two discs veered too close to the worst of 'Touched By an Angel,' (even though I like the best of that show) but the last three discs maintain a good pace and are very entertaining. In honesty, the only episode I strongly remember of the whole run was that in which Gary sees his successor, and I dearly hope that the show will keep being issued so that I can be reach that point again.",5,"Starts weak, finishes strong",1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,1667,"['nearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'season', 'set', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'contained', 'weak', 'episodes', 'too', 'much', 'sap', 'movie-of-the-week', 'type', 'topical', 'stories', 'Please', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', ""'d"", 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'originally', 'had', 'gone', 'soft-headed', 'season', 'two', 'Fortunately', 'stuck', 'was', 'rewarded', 'last', 'three', 'discs', 'episodes', 'went', 'back', 'often', 'outdid', 'strengths', 'season', '1', 'Gary', 'Hobson', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'protagonist', 'who', 'tomorrow', 'Chicago', 'Sun-Times', 'today', 'not', 'sap', 'do', 'best', 'wo', ""n't"", 'turn', 'back', 'who', 'need', 'not', 'entirely', 'willing', 'hero', ""n't"", 'too', 'surprised', 'when', 'help', ""n't"", 'welcomed', 'Even', 'more', 'skeptical', 'friend', 'co-worker', 'Chuck', 'Fisher', 'Stevens', 'who', 'co-workers', 'Marissa', 'ex-detective', 'Crumb', 'ground', 'expand', 'focus', 'show', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'show', 'humor', 'returns', 'particular', 'wonderful', 'Fourth', 'Carpathian', 'four', 'Carpathian', 'brothers', 'Crumb', 'Gary', 'parents', 'are', 'featured', 'episode', 'light-hearted', 'still', 'full', 'heart', 'Crumb', 'someone', 'something', 'watching', 'over', 'Gary', 'appreciate', 'whoever', 'sending', 'newspaper', 'kept', 'cryptic', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'veered', 'too', 'close', 'worst', ""'Touched"", 'Angel', 'even', 'like', 'best', 'show', 'last', 'three', 'discs', 'maintain', 'good', 'pace', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'honesty', 'only', 'episode', 'strongly', 'remember', 'whole', 'run', 'was', 'Gary', 'successor', 'dearly', 'hope', 'show', 'will', 'keep', 'being', 'issued', 'can', 'be', 'reach', 'point', 'again']",Early Edition: Season 2
