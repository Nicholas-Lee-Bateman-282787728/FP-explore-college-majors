My boys love watching it and playing with their train table, even though they have seen some of the episodes before.

I have all the VHS's up to when Alec Baldwin started narrating, recently i purchased the original 6 UK VHS's to get all of Ringo Starrs Narrations, but as growing up in the US his US Narrations of the 42 episodes he did was nostalgic. But there was only 5 VHS's releases of his narration and only one shining time station VHS(the christmas special) that was released. There should have been another VHS with the last 7 stories that were on shining time station, with Percy takes The Plunge, Percy's Ghostly Trick, Woolly Bear, Saved from Scrap, A New Friend for Thomas, and Thomas's christmas party and the infamous edit of Thomas and the missing christmas tree. Instead we got Trust thomas, and these episodes were then released with George Carlins narration. In recent years all these episodes have been circulating on the internet, Percy takes the plunge RS US was released on the best of Percy years ago, and wooly bear and Percys Ghostly Trick had been going around youtube in good quality. But Saved from Scrap and A New Friend for Thomas was in Horrible quality! Untill now, but this DVD has episodes from Season 1 all the way till Season 11(the one before CGI) It had a great mix of episodes on it would recomend it!",5,"Great collection, with 2 super rare Ringo Starr US narrations!",1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,1315,"['was', 'born', 'late', '1991', 'kid', 'Thomas', 'Tank', 'Engine', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'have', 'VHS', 'up', 'when', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'started', 'narrating', 'recently', 'purchased', 'original', '6', 'UK', 'VHS', 'get', 'Ringo', 'Starrs', 'Narrations', 'growing', 'up', 'US', 'US', 'Narrations', '42', 'episodes', 'did', 'was', 'nostalgic', 'was', 'only', '5', 'VHS', 'releases', 'narration', 'only', 'one', 'shining', 'time', 'station', 'VHS', 'christmas', 'special', 'was', 'released', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'VHS', 'last', '7', 'stories', 'were', 'shining', 'time', 'station', 'Percy', 'Plunge', 'Percy', 'Ghostly', 'Trick', 'Woolly', 'Bear', 'Saved', 'Scrap', 'A', 'New', 'Friend', 'Thomas', 'Thomas', 'christmas', 'party', 'infamous', 'edit', 'Thomas', 'missing', 'christmas', 'tree', 'Instead', 'got', 'Trust', 'thomas', 'episodes', 'were', 'then', 'released', 'George', 'Carlins', 'narration', 'recent', 'years', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'circulating', 'internet', 'Percy', 'plunge', 'RS', 'US', 'was', 'released', 'best', 'Percy', 'years', 'ago', 'wooly', 'bear', 'Percys', 'Ghostly', 'Trick', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'around', 'youtube', 'good', 'quality', 'Saved', 'Scrap', 'A', 'New', 'Friend', 'Thomas', 'was', 'Horrible', 'quality', 'Untill', 'now', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'way', 'till', 'Season', '11', 'one', 'CGI', 'had', 'great', 'mix', 'episodes', 'would', 'recomend']",Thomas & Friends: Engine Friends

Wonderful to be able to kick back and relax and soak up the lovely world of Thomas sans blood, gore, stress, violence, backstabbing, cursing, one-uppage, and generally spiritually lacking shows of today.

The picture is clear and the sound is great.Was going to give this a 5 star rating if not for my one complaint is that you have to sit through the opening credits for every single episode and you can't skip chapters as the opening is part of the same chapter as the show. THAT gets really annoying really fast.Okay, my other complaint is that you can't just hit MENU to bypass the trailers at the beginning so you have to constantly skip chapters to get to the &#34;Auto Play&#34; or &#34;Menu&#34; selection screen",4,Great DVD for my toddler.,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,627,"['daughter', 'can', 'sit', 'watch', 'way', 'let', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'episodes', 'picture', 'clear', 'sound', 'great.Was', 'going', 'give', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'not', 'one', 'complaint', 'have', 'sit', 'opening', 'credits', 'single', 'episode', 'ca', ""n't"", 'skip', 'chapters', 'opening', 'part', 'same', 'chapter', 'show', 'really', 'annoying', 'really', 'fast.Okay', 'other', 'complaint', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'hit', 'MENU', 'bypass', 'trailers', 'beginning', 'so', 'have', 'constantly', 'skip', 'chapters', 'get', '34', 'Auto', 'Play', '34', '34', 'Menu', '34', 'selection', 'screen']",Thomas & Friends: Engine Friends
