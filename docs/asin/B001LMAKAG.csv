1215115,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B001LMAKAG,Andy Orrock,"[1, 1]","This movie does a fine job capturing the spirit and energy of the Broadway production of Rent.  [It also exposes the shortcomings ofRent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition), the Hollywood's 2005 adaptation, but that's beside the point.]  One thing you lose in the translation to the screen is the primacy of the music - in person, it is a loud, rocking musical.  The band stands equal to the actors.  Here, the band is slightly pushed to the background.  I suspect this is a conscious decision in the mixing room so that the storyline is clearly audible.What the title of the film doesn't make entirely clear is what makes it special:  this is the show's final Broadway performance.  As a result the emotion is sky high...and there are surprises galore in the curtain call and DVD extras.The actors here are going to be held accountable to the performances of the original Broadway cast.  Those voices are immortalized forever on the sterling soundtrack.  Adam Pascal. Idina Menzel. Daphne Rubin-Vega.  Anthony Rapp. Jesse L. Martin.  Taye Diggs.  These are legends now.  How do you compare to that?  In most cases - with one notable exception - pretty well.  Eden Espinosa stands out as Maureen, as does young rookie Adam Kantor, perfectly cast as Mark Cohen.  The one big dropoff for me was Will Chase as Roger, the role perfected by Adam Pascal.  Pascal was a rocker before he was an actor.  He brought a vocal primacy to the role that is lacking from Chase's vocals.  Plus, Chase is 38, same age as Pascal is today.  The show debuted 12 years ago.  Roger is supposed to be Mark's contemporary.  Here, he's 17 years older than Mark.  It shows.I give this five stars because of the extras.  For Rent-heads, there's some spectacular backstage material here, including an unexpectedly moving look at the ""Last Lottery"" (where they dole out seats in the first two rows for $20 apiece - a brilliant buzz creator).  Where it gets you is the impact the show's closing has on the guys running the lottery. It's clear these two gentleman loved their jobs and conducted the lottery with unbridled passion.",5,Suprises galore in the curtain call and DVD extras in this final Broadway performance caught on film,1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,2100,"['movie', 'fine', 'job', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'energy', 'Broadway', 'production', 'Rent', '[', 'also', 'shortcomings', 'ofRent', 'Widescreen', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Hollywood', '2005', 'adaptation', 'beside', 'point', ']', 'One', 'thing', 'lose', 'translation', 'screen', 'primacy', 'music', 'person', 'loud', 'rocking', 'musical', 'band', 'equal', 'actors', 'Here', 'band', 'slightly', 'pushed', 'background', 'suspect', 'conscious', 'decision', 'mixing', 'room', 'storyline', 'clearly', 'audible.What', 'title', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'entirely', 'clear', 'what', 'special', 'show', 'final', 'Broadway', 'performance', 'result', 'emotion', 'sky', 'high', 'are', 'surprises', 'galore', 'curtain', 'call', 'DVD', 'extras.The', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'held', 'accountable', 'performances', 'original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'voices', 'are', 'immortalized', 'forever', 'sterling', 'soundtrack', 'Adam', 'Pascal', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'Daphne', 'Rubin-Vega', 'Anthony', 'Rapp', 'Jesse', 'L.', 'Martin', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'are', 'legends', 'now', 'How', 'do', 'compare', 'most', 'cases', 'one', 'notable', 'exception', 'pretty', 'well', 'Eden', 'Espinosa', 'out', 'Maureen', 'young', 'rookie', 'Adam', 'Kantor', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Mark', 'Cohen', 'one', 'big', 'dropoff', 'was', 'Will', 'Chase', 'Roger', 'role', 'perfected', 'Adam', 'Pascal', 'Pascal', 'was', 'rocker', 'was', 'actor', 'brought', 'vocal', 'primacy', 'role', 'lacking', 'Chase', 'vocals', 'Chase', '38', 'same', 'age', 'Pascal', 'today', 'show', 'debuted', '12', 'years', 'ago', 'Roger', 'supposed', 'be', 'Mark', 'contemporary', 'Here', '17', 'years', 'older', 'Mark', 'shows.I', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'extras', 'Rent-heads', 'spectacular', 'backstage', 'material', 'here', 'including', 'unexpectedly', 'moving', 'look', 'Last', 'Lottery', 'where', 'dole', 'out', 'seats', 'first', 'two', 'rows', '20', 'apiece', 'brilliant', 'buzz', 'creator', 'Where', 'impact', 'show', 'closing', 'guys', 'running', 'lottery', 'clear', 'two', 'gentleman', 'loved', 'jobs', 'conducted', 'lottery', 'unbridled', 'passion']",N/A
1215116,A4HQVWV6BZ50H,B001LMAKAG,Ashley Collins,"[1, 1]","I was introduced to the world of RENT in 2005 with the release of the film adaptation, and I'm glad to say I've come a long way since. I loved the film, but then I got to see the actual show in Cleveland in 2006 and fell even more in love with the whole thing. There's a certain raw edge, a certain emotional level to the stage show that I felt was missing in the film. So as you can imagine I was beyond excited when I heard they were filming the last night on Broadway. I missed the opportunity to see the final tour when it came through Cleveland, so I definitely made it a priority to buy this dvd.Well, it came in the mail yesterday and since then I think I've watched it three times. Yeah. Maybe I just miss the stage show that much, or maybe it's just that good of a show. Or maybe both; I don't know.So, a rundown of favorites, because that's what I love to talk about:My favorite character here is definitely Mark. Adam Kantor is incredible, especially considering he was still a student at Northwestern University when this was filmed. Makes me jealous. But he's so adorable and he completely gets the character. I think his portrayal is a bit more sarcastic (however subtly) than Anthony Rapp's, and like I say he made Mark my favorite character.Roger (Will Chase) was another wonderfully portrayed role. Besides One Song Glory (which he delivers fantastically), the part that sticks out in my mind is the end of the Life Support meeting, when Roger turns and joins Gordon in singing ""Because reason says I should've died three years ago"". SO powerful. He also has excellent chemistry with Renee Elise Goldsberry (Mimi), a must... which brings me to her.Renee makes an excellent Mimi -- what I adore most is her energy. She bounces all over the place and she's adorable. After I saw the film and before I saw the stage show, I couldn't fathom how a woman could pull off electric blue spandex and call it sexy at the same time -- I'd seen pictures of Daphne Rubin-Vega and others, and the look just didn't appeal to me in the slightest. But once you've seen it, and seen it done well, you understand. Goldsberry pulls it off just like anyone else who has ever played Mimi on stage, and does it beautifully. The one thing I criticize about her is that her voice seems a bit too opera-suited and not as ""raw"" as I would prefer -- too much vibrato in places where I would expect to hear just a straight note. But she has a beautiful voice and cannot be faulted for that.Justin Johnston's Angel is probably my favorite out of the three I've seen (including original cast member Wilson Jermaine Heredia, in the film). He imbues Angel with a joy of life that makes him completely irresistible. To tell the truth, Angel had been one of my least favorite characters in the past, but as with Mark, I've fallen in love with Angel. My favorite bit from him is a little line just before ""I'll Cover You,"" when Collins asks if they're a ""thing"". Angel replies, ""Darling, we're everything."" I was sold. SO cute.His counterpart, Michael McElroy's Collins, is performed very solidly. I wasn't overly impressed, but I liked him all the same. This is another pair that needs to have chemistry, and they definitely do. Their interactions in ""I'll Cover You"" and ""You Okay Honey?"" are excellent and really set the tone for their characters' love story.Maureen, played by Eden Espinosa, is fantastic. She's enthusiastic, funny, and believable, and that's what I love about her. (For all the theatre geeks out there, I just want to say I think it's awesome that this is the second time she's picked up a role begun by Idina Menzel). =] I've seen clips of when she performed in Wicked, but I have to say I love her Maureen. She works really well with Traci's Joanne (again, chemistry -- love it) and her rendition of ""Over the Moon"" is hilarious.Traci Thoms -- who is someone Rent enthusiasts should remember as Joanne in the film as well -- is I think much better in this on-stage setting. ""We're Okay"" gives her a chance to show off her solo stuff, and she just seems to fit the part better in the stage costume.Rodney Hicks, an original cast member, plays Benny and was, I think, very successful. He made the character a bit more cheesy than Taye's original, very accustomed to his life as the husband of a ""wealthy daughter of the revolution.""Personally, I really loved watching the people in the chorus. All of them were phenomenal in the multiple character personas that each played. I adored all of them and each, I think, is notable. Gwen Stewart is an original cast member and just as wonderful as she was on the cast album. Jay Wilkison was incredible as Gordon and ""The Man"", among others. Telly Leung was most adorable as the squeegee man and the waiter, and Marcus Paul James gave a flawless performance in all of his characters. My very favorite though was Tracy McDowell, who had played Maureen when I saw the tour in Cleveland. She was a joy to watch, never boring.Overall, I have to say that I don't think any diehard RENThead should go without this in their collection. This show will be missed -- here's a chance to hang onto it.No day but today.",5,Flawless -- that's all there is to it,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,5152,"['was', 'introduced', 'world', 'RENT',

1215119,A1M181I8IYDLDA,B001LMAKAG,Brandon Cozart,"[1, 1]","When I first read last year that RENT was closing on Broadway, I had to read those words several times over to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. Over the last twelve years, the show has been a profound part of the lives of many people. This may seem strange, but, well, RENT is hardly an ordinary musical.RENT, a modern update of Puccini's La Boheme, is the story of a group of friends living in the East Village of New York City in the mid-'90s. Over the course of two and a half hours, the audience gets a glimpse of this Bohemian lifestyle, an incredibly honest glimpse that is as far as can be from the Rodgers and Hammerstein type of Broadway storytelling. The cast struggles with the meanings of love, friendship, and life, as well as the pains of poverty, loss, addiction, and HIV/AIDS. It is an incredibly engaging story which takes the audience on a roller-coaster of emotions from the first number to the final curtain.Because the show has affected so many over its twelve year run, those involved have graciously allowed the production of this filmed version to serve as a monument to the late Jonathan Larson's Pulitzer-winning masterpiece, as well as giving those who never got the opportunity to see the show on Broadway a chance to have that experience in some fashion. In the interest of self-disclosure, when I heard that this disc was going to be released, I was a bit skeptical. As is mentioned in the included special features, part of the magic of seeing a show on Broadway is being in that moment and atmosphere. I was unsure how that magic would translate from being in the theatre to watching the performance on a television screen.I am happy to report, however, that my skepticism was unfounded. Though not as good as seeing RENT live, RENT: Filmed Live on Broadway is the next best thing (yes, even better than the 2005 theatrical version). The performance in this release is the result of a mix of footage from the last Broadway performance on September 7, 2008 and scenes filmed outside the environment of a ticketed performance. The editing is done really well and it is difficult to tell which scenes were filmed live or not, though there are some obvious points.As with any Broadway show, the cast can make or break any given performance. This cast is one of the best that I have personally seen. Most are RENT veterans and are thus intimately familiar with the characters they play and the relationship dynamics. Standouts include Adam Kantor's portrayal of Mark Cohen and Justin Johnston's Angel (Johnston has continued this role in the Rent farewell tour currently touring the country).The Blu-ray version contains a number of special features covering different aspects of the show's last week on Broadway. These include featurettes on the note-covered outside walls of the Nederlander Theatre, the Nederlander itself, casting the show over its twelve year run, choosing the final Broadway cast, members of the original cast who came back to see the last performance, and a featurette on the final $20 ticket lottery. Also included are two PSAs, one for the Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation, and the other for the National Marfan Foundation (Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that is the likely cause of the aortic aneurysm that ended Larson's life).The film is presented in 1080p with an aspect ratio of 1:78:1.  This film really shows off the capabilities of HD presentation.  The colors are rich and vibrant, the black levels are realistically deep, and there were no noticeable film artifacts.  Even small details, like the glitter shaken out of Mimi's hair during ""Out Tonight,"" were picked up by the cameras used to capture the performance.  The video quality is truly amazing.The audio is also impressive, though not as impressive as the video.  Recorded in Dolby TrueHD 5.1, the audio is able to pick up subtle nuances in the performance both on stage and in the audience.  The music and speech come through the center and front channels, with the audience filling the two rear speakers in an attempt to recreate the performance hall feel.  The disappointments come in the band not coming through as raw and powerful as they would in a live performance, most of the time sounding far off and muted.  Despite this, the audio is still good enough to not take too much away from the overall presentation.More than a Broadway show, RENT was an event, a happening that completely encapsulated the culture of Jonathan Larson and others struggling with life and loss in the Bohemian world of New York City.

What is also amazing about the live  show is that the production stands out on its' own with no star power. The actors are very powerful. I thought that Mimi in particular was outstanding. I love Rosario Dawson but this young lady had great timing and you could see she did her research.There's no day but today to write how great this dvd is! Rent is perhaps one of my best films ever. I loved each and every aspect of it. My daughter and I watch this film every year. Rent captures the spirit of a people who is filled with love, compassion and commitment towards themselves and their beliefs. It shows how your life could suddenly change in a year.I also found it amazing how the cast was able to express what it is like to be poor. How they were cold and hungry and still managed to do what they do. Starving artists, friends, lovers, family. This is a heart breaking, gripping and raw look into the lives of people who do what they can to make it in this world.This was Jonathan Larson's gift to the world. What a great gift it was. Generations will now understand the effects of poverty, AIDS, caring and friendship because of him. He found that one song, that one last glory before he transcended. Make sure you get the live Broadway version too.

1215123,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001LMAKAG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[40, 40]","When you watch a live performance of a concert or musical and if that Blu-ray goes as far as it can to replicate that live experience, you know you're going to have a enjoyable time.  ""RENT: Filmed LIVE on Broadway"" is a fantastic experience on Blu-ray from awesome picture quality, great sound utilization for those with a home theater and a disc loaded with featurettes with substance.  A solid and fantastic release for those who are passionate for the seventh longest running musical ever.""RENT"" had been in development since 1988 and made a reality in 1994.  But the musical wouldn't become a success until its Broadway debut in Jan. 1996.  ""RENT"" is a reimagining of Giacomo Puccini's opera ""La Boheme"" and its modern setting and enjoyable characters and addictive music has captured so many hearts with its twelve year run.  It has won a Pulitzer Prize, four Tony Awards and credit has to go to the hardworking and passionate staff and its cast members who have put their heart and soul to ""RENT"", but this release is also a celebration of life and love, written by ""RENT"" creator Jonathan Larson.From the actors getting on stage and everyone applauding to the ten minute intermission and then the final farewell in which the current cast and the original cast share the same stage and all sing ""Seasons of Love"", the final live performance was powerful and as for the Blu-ray, the additions of the bonus features will definitely attract the hardcore and even curious fans!VIDEO & AUDIO:The film is presented in 1080p high definition (1:78:1).  The picture quality was amazing on Blu-ray.  Picture quality was clear, colors were vibrant but most importantly, almost similar to any successful concert performance, what can make it or break a performance is how many camera angles are utilized, how they are edited and how well they cut from character to character.  And the good news is that this musical was successful in accomplishing the job.  Lighting was just right!  Performances were fantastic and the ability to cover each performer interacting on stage knowing that a camera is probably in their way, everything went quite well.  So, with the Blu-ray video transfer receiving high marks, how does the audio even compare?As for the audio, audio is featured in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  And I have to let you know that if you own a home theater system with surround sound, how awesome the sound quality is.  In fact, for those who want that theatre experience like if you were watching it live.  The audio clearly features the dialogue and music from your front speakers.  But your rear surround speakers feature the audience.  I was blown away to hear the audience giggling, cheering and their overall excitement during the performance.  Although it doesn't beat being there for an actual live show, at least there was great care in making sure the audio was great.  So, it's like being in the front row and hearing the audience behind you.  Well done!SPECIAL FEATURES:This is probably what is going to win the RENT-heads and those who admire or are curious about ""RENT"" will truly enjoy.  Lengthy special features targeted towards the fans of ""RENT"" and are featured in standard and hi-definition.  The majority of them are in HD.  Included are:* The Wall - This featurette focuses on how the fans have left hand written messages on the walls of Nederlander Theatre.  A good size featurette showcasing the various signatures written throughout the years and the goodbye messages from fans of the musical.  Very touching!* The Final Curtain -This featurette focuses on the original cast who were backstage and preparing to join the current cast for the final farewell and all of them united in their final goodbyes and singing ""Seasons of Love"" together.  Very touching and emotional to watch.* Home - This featurette was about how they chose the Nederland Theatre and how it was not quite hospitable and needed a lot of fixing up.  But even today, the interesting things about the theatre that the cast and crew share their experiences.  Answering questions of why the ceilings were not fully painted, the obstacles the crew had to face in getting it ready and much more.  An informative but also fun featurette.* The Final Lottery - Since moving to Nederland Theatre, there has been a lottery to RENT-heads who would camp outside in order to get the discounted $20 tickets for the show. Those who got tickets got to sit in the front two rows.  This segment features the final lottery, hundreds of people in line hoping to get a ticket for the final day and how emotional the experience was for the fans who won tickets for the final day and also how emotional it was for the two men in charge of giving out the tickets for the lottery.* Casting - A behind-the-scenes look at the casting for ""RENT"".  Every person who auditioned have been kept in dozens upon dozens of binders.  Each person who was cast had to be seen multiple times and you get quite a bit of insight on the casting and the experience of the current talent and how many times (and how many years) they auditioned to get a role in the musical.* Rent: The Final Days on Broadway - This is the lengthiest featurette featuring a specialized casting for the final week of ""RENT"" bringing back some old cast members but finding the right cast for the final week and the final day.  Bringing everyone together and an in-depth look at how emotional everyone was during the filming.  A lot of interviews with cast and crew.  Especially those  remembering ""RENT"" creator Jonathan Larson and bringing back the Larson family one last time for them to meet and greet the crew, staff and talent.  Touching and overall an awesome featurette!  But to see how emotional distraught some of the hardcore fans were on the final day was incredibly touching.  So many people touched by this musical and also the lives changed for the positive because of ""RENT"" was amazing.* Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation PSA - This featurette is about the foundation for those in the performing arts who can win a grant (to be used for anything, groceries, rent, babysitting, etc.) to help out performing artists.* National Marfan Foundation PSA - ""RENT"" creator Jonathan Larson died from an aortic aneurysm believed to have resulted from Marfan syndrome.  And this informative PSA was letting people know about the genetic disorder and the National Marfan Foundation.I was first introduced to ""RENT"" back in 2000.  As most musicals, my first introduction is typically by the soundtracks first but I have dreamed of  watching ""RENT"" in Broadway for many years and I ultimately thought that it was a musical I can just catch whenever and expected a long musical run.  So, when I found out that the long running musical would no longer be live in Broadway as of Sept. 7, 2008, I was saddened and felt that I lost my opportunity.But after watching ""RENT: Filmed LIVE on Broadway"", words can not describe how happy I was to hear about a Blu-ray release and how the live performance would be in High Definition.The Blu-ray release was absolutely fantastic!  This is probably the next best thing of catching a Broadway show without having been there because not only was the picture quality outstanding but the way the audio was created, the awesome energy from the audience is felt through your surround sound.  The music just comes alive and everything was just done right when it comes to the video and audio presentation to DVD and Blu-ray translation from the final Broadway performance.  Camera angle cuts, editing, lighting, audience participation and more.  And if you thought the awesome performance of the musical was all your getting, ""RENT"" fans will not be disappointed because you get a good number of lengthy featurettes included on the special features section.Although the Broadway performance of ""RENT"" is over, the long running musical is captured perfectly in ""RENT: Filmed LIVE on Broadway"" and is absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray! I wouldn't be surprise if this video became a cult-hit among the fans of the musical for many years to come. This release is not just a live performance, it's a celebration of life and a celebration of love.If you are a fan of ""RENT"" or like myself, have always dreamed of watching ""RENT"" live, ""RENT: Filmed LIVE on Broadway"" is not only fantastic, it's highly recommended!",5,FANTASTIC!  Rent-heads or anyone passionate about this musical will no doubt be captured by the Blu-ray edition!,1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,8379,"['When', 'watch', 'live', 'performance', 'concert', 'musical',

I am not typically a fan of musicals, and this is the exception. The story was relevant, the characters allowed you to empathize, and the story is a humanistic, and relatable storyline, that captivates people of all walks of life, and situations. I absolutely LOVED the broadway show.I had seen the other ""movie"" of Rent and was not impressed. This ""live taping"" is redemption for a Broadway legacy. Film, unlike a broadway live performance, adds the extra aspect, of being able to ""point"" your attention towards the scene or expression on an actors' face that you are meant to see. This live taping achieves a significant level of focus,in making sure that you do not miss key moments of the show and the interaction of the actors.The picture and sound quality were phenomenal. The Blu-Ray presentation was perfect for this project, as the colors, music and detail pop on screen, for the viewer. It is a great ""beyond the front row"" opportunity, and after certain songs, I felt like I was ""there"" all over again.The features were touching and well done, and provided the necessary perspective, to remind us, of the impact that the creator of Rent, had on generations of audience members, and on their personal stories.An absolutely MUST for Rent Heads!",5,A visual success & beautiful tribute for any Renthead!,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,1318,"['1st', 'saw', 'Rent', 'NYC', 'June', '1999', 'girlfriend', 'birthday', 'am', 'not', 'typically', 'fan', 'musicals', 'exception', 'story', 'was', 'relevant', 'characters', 'allowed', 'empathize', 'story', 'humanistic', 'relatable', 'storyline', 'people', 'walks', 'life', 'situations', 'absolutely', 'LOVED', 'broadway', 'show.I', 'had', 'seen', 'other', 'movie', 'Rent', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'live', 'taping', 'redemption', 'Broadway', 'legacy', 'Film', 'broadway', 'live', 'performance', 'extra', 'aspect', 'being', 'able', 'point', 'attention', 'scene', 'expression', 'actors', 'face', 'are', 'meant', 'see', 'live', 'taping', 'significant', 'level', 'focus', 'making', 'sure', 'do', 'not', 'miss', 'key', 'moments', 'show', 'interaction', 'actors.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'were', 'phenomenal', 'Blu-Ray', 'presentation', 'was', 'perfect', 'project', 'colors', 'music', 'detail', 'pop', 'screen', 'viewer', 'great', 'front', 'row', 'opportunity', 'certain', 'songs', 'felt', 'was', 'there', 'again.The', 'features', 'were', 'touching', 'well', 'done', 'provided', 'necessary', 'perspective', 'remind', 'impact', 'creator', 'Rent', 'had', 'generations', 'audience', 'members', 'personal', 'stories.An', 'absolutely', 'MUST', 'Rent', 'Heads']",N/A
1215126,A3W0S9MR4A959D,B001LMAKAG,dramadude 186,"[2, 2]","Well, it had to happen eventually.  After 12 years on Broadway, ""Rent"" has finally closed its doors.  As far as musicals go, it is certainly one of the best documented, with numerous books, news articles, and websites devoted to its creation.There are many theories about why the show became and remains so popular, but my two cents is that it was simply the right story told in the right way at the right time.  In the mid-nineties, an entire generation of theatre fans was looking for a musical that spoke to them, about issues unique to their generation (in the same way ""Hair"" embodies the hippie counter-culture for children of the 60s).  And along came Jonathan Larson, who cleverly recast Puccini's timeless opera ""La Boheme"" as a rock-musical about artists, rockers, gays, and lesbians struggling with issues like drugs and AIDS in New York City.  It was a story that spoke to people, particularly young people, yet dealt with such universal issues like love and acceptance that fans of any age could relate.It even managed to get a film adaptation in 2005, but many fans (myself included) felt that despite the inclusion of most of the original cast, Hollywood did not do justice to the stage version.  For all of those fans, and those who have yet to experience ""Rent,"" this DVD is the answer.  This is the show we all fell in love with, performed to near perfection by an energetic young cast and filmed live during its final days on Broadway.Like any good Rent-head, I have seen the show multiple times, and this is honestly the best cast I have ever seen.  They convey the energy and emotion so vital to the show's success, making it feel fresh and new again.  You'd never know the show had been running for 12 straight years, because this cast attacks the material with such sincerity and heart.  Not only do they sound incredible, but this cast is also the strongest group of actors I have seen in these roles.  My biggest complaint about ""Rent"" is that I never felt it was acted to its full potential.  Until now.  I know the show backwards and forwards, and yet they brought out all kinds of nuances and connections I had previously missed.  The cast's commitment and honesty make songs like ""La Vie Boheme"" and the title tune truly celebratory, and ""Without You"" and ""I'll Cover You (Reprise)"" all the more heartwrenching.  And watching Angel run onstage to join the final tableau will always make me misty-eyed (and I rarely get that emotional).Standouts include: Will Chase as Roger, giving a near difinitive interpretation of the role (sorry, Adam Pascal fans); Renee Goldsberry as his love interest, the drug-addicted Mimi; Eden Espinosa as defiant protest artist Maureen; and Tracie Thoms, reprising her role of Joanne from the 2005 film and proving she definitely has the vocal and acting chops to perform this show 8 times a week.Any fan of ""Rent"" needs this DVD.  It preserves the show in its entirity (no cutting ""Christmas Bells"" for time!), with the staging and inherent theatricality that really makes the show sing.  It is *almost* as good as seeing the show live.  Now you can relive this show, a true landmark in musical theatre history, whenever you want.  Which is easily worth $20 they're asking for this disc.",5,A Fitting Tribute to a Modern Musical Masterpiece,1238284800,"03 29, 2009",2009,3246,"['Well', 'had', 'happen', 'eventually', '12', 'years', 'Broadway', 'Rent', 'finally', 'closed', 'doors', 'As', 'far', 'musicals', 'go', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'documented', 'numerous', 'books', 'news', 'articles', 'websites', 'devoted', 'creation.There', 'are', 'many', 'theories', 'why', 'show', 'became', 'so', 'popular', 'two', 'cents', 'was', 'simply', 'right', 'story', 'told', 'right', 'way', 'right', 'time', 'mid-nineties', 'entire', 'generation', 'theatre', 'fans', 'was', 'looking', 'musical', 'spoke', 'about', 'issues', 'unique', 'generation', 'same', 'way', 'Hair', 'hippie', 'counter-culture', 'children', '60s', 'came', 'Jonathan', 'Larson', 'who', 'cleverly', 'recast', 'Puccini', 'timeless', 'opera', 'La', 'Boheme', 'rock-musical', 'artists', 'rockers', 'gays', 'struggling', 'issues', 'drugs', 'AIDS', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'was', 'story', 'spoke', 'people', 'particularly', 'young', 'people', 'yet', 'dealt', 'such', 'universal', 'issues', 'love', 'acceptance', 'fans', 'age', 'could', 'relate.It', 'even', 'managed', 'get', 'film', 'adaptation', '2005', 'many', 'fans', 'included', 'felt', 'inclusion', 'most', 'original', 'cast', 'Hollywood', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'stage', 'version', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'experience', 'Rent', 'DVD', 'answer', 'show', 'fell', 'love', 'performed', 'perfection', 'energetic', 'young', 'cast', 'filmed', 'live', 'final', 'days', 'good', 'Rent-head', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'multiple', 'times', 'honestly', 'best', 'cast', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'convey', 'energy', 'emotion', 'so', 'vital', 'show', 'success', 'making', 'feel', 'fresh', 'new', 'again', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'running', '12', 'straight', 'years', 'cast', 'material', 'such', 'sincerity', 'heart', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'sound', 'incredible', 'cast', 'also', 'strongest', 'group', 'actors', 'have', 'seen', 'roles', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'Rent', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'acted', 'full', 'potential', 'now', 'know', 'show', 'backwards', 'forwards', 'yet', 'brought', 'out', 'kinds', 'nuances', 'connections', 'had', 'previously', 'missed', 'cast', 'commitment', 'honesty', 'make', 'songs', 'La', 'Vie', 'Boheme', 'title', 'tune', 'truly', 'celebratory', ""'ll"", 'Cover', 'Reprise', 'more', 'heartwrenching', 'watching', 'Angel', 'run', 'onstage', 'join', 'final', 'tableau', 'will', 'always', 'make', 'misty-eyed', 'rarely', 'get', 'emotional', 'include', 'Will', 'Chase', 'Roger', 'giving', 'near', 'difinitive', 'interpretation', 'role', 'sorry', 'Adam', 'Pascal', 'fans', 'Renee', 'Goldsberry', 'love', 'interest', 'drug-addicted', 'Mimi', 'Eden', 'Espinosa', 'defiant', 'protest', 'artist', 'Maureen', 'Tracie', 'Thoms', 'reprising', 'role', 'Joanne', '2005', 'film', 'proving', 'definitely', 'vocal', 'acting', 'chops', 'perform', 'show', '8', 'times', 'week.Any', 'fan', 'Rent', 'DVD', 'show', 'entirity', 'cutting', 'Christmas', 'Bells', 'time', 'staging', 'inherent', 'theatricality', 'really', 'show', 'sing', '*almost*', 'as', 'good', 'seeing', 'show', 'live', 'Now', 'can', 'relive', 'show', 'true', 'landmark', 'musical', 'theatre', 'history', 'whenever', 'want', 'Which', 'easily', 'worth', '20', ""'re"", 'asking', 'disc']",N/A

1215135,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B001LMAKAG,James Hiller,"[2, 2]","Rent is it's own phenomenon. Truly a unique show on Broadway, gritty, real, raw. For twelve years, it set the White Way on fire with its music, its stories of all types of love, it's handling of AIDS and drug abuse. It became more than just a musical, but an honoring of so many people's stories, of so many people's realities. With the news of the closing of the show, the powers that be smiled upon us, and took to filming one of the final performances of the show for austerity and all of us who have spent the last years loving this show.Not to be confused with the movie version, which recaptured many of the original actors performances in the roles they founded, Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway captures the zest and energy of the actual show. After having watched the movie version now for a couple of years frequently, I'd forgotten how much of the original show songs that I really loved that had been eliminated from the movie. The performances of the final cast are real, although I must admit my heart longs for Anthony Rapp or Idina Menzel again.Sometimes, the filming of a musical just doesn't work well. Odd cuts, weird camera angles, or jarring shots sometimes take you out of the show and become more distracting. Fortunately, this show has none of that. The camera work is invisible, and very real, allowing you to enjoy the show fully.Complete with several ""makng of"" segments that only add to the enjoyment of the DVD, this is one disc that you must have for your collection if you are a fan of the show.

The bond between cast mates is unlike anything else in the world. Being in the audience of a great show offers the understanding of what true magic really is. ...A movie is nothing compared to the stage production of any show. But this theatre performance in film completely blew...me...AWAY....I was watching this with two friends and we found ourselves bursting in thunderous laughing.

1215141,A3JZ5L52FM318H,B001LMAKAG,"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen""","[3, 4]","My wife is a bigger fan of musicals than I am. I enjoy them now and again, though. So while I went into this Blu-Ray thinking ""well, this is one for the wife,"" I came away having definitely enjoyed the show on both technical and artistic levels.First, the program itself:""Rent"" is a wildly successful musical for a good reason. It has very enjoyable songs, a plot which is easy to relate to, and a certain ""cool factor"" which is undeniable. The extra features on the disc also go into some of the other aspects which made it such a success - its unique venue in NY, the tight knit cast and crew, etc.I will say, being a complete ""Rent"" neophyte, I came away with ambiguous feelings about the message of the show. I mean, sure, appreciating your family (whether adopted or otherwise) and enjoying the present moment without wallowing in regrets are probably pretty good things. But what about making good, solid choices in terms of your lifestyle in the first place? Given the drug use and promiscuous sex (gay or straight, whatever your pleasure is fine by me) portrayed, is it any mystery why many of the characters suffer from AIDS and drug addictions? It may be telling that the characters who make what are likely the most ""conservative"" choices (the filmmaker, the landlord) are the ones who are portrayed least favorably.In the end, I might be worried about the messages this sends to young viewers, and I'd probably wait until a child was 12 or 13 before exposing them to this. A kid would need the ability to critically analyze characters and compare them to his or her life before I would let them watch something which seems at times to glorify lifestyle choices that put their adherents in danger of disease, homelessness, addiction, etc. Compare a show like ""Chicago"" - although it follows characters who perform many dastardly deeds in seeking fame, such behavior always earns its comeuppance in the end, and there is a very dark satirical edge to it. This complexity seems missing, here.Anyway, for an adult audience, this is certainly a good show with many memorable character moments, scenes, dances, and songs. It's quite dazzling and contains very high-quality singing. It definitely ranks up there as one of the better Broadway shows I've seen.The Blu-Ray:WOW! This is in the top tier of Blu-Ray discs I've viewed. Detail is crisp and consistent without being over-processed, colors really pop (owing in part to the dark backdrops), and the sound is immersive. This presentation is reminiscent of very good HD concert footage you might find on Over-The-Air HDTV or on premium cable channels like HDNET - but even better still, since Blu-Ray allows for less compression of the source material.You should definitely make sure your TV or projector are well-calibrated - this is a disc with a LOT of black on the screen at any given time. If your brightness levels and gamma are not set well, a digital display can easily crush a lot of the detail in dark parts of the screen. I would recommend, short of buying a calibration disc such as ""Digital Video Essentials,"" that you at least pop in a Lucasfilm DVD (e.g. Star Wars, Indiana Jones) to use the ""THX Optimizer."" This way, you can ensure that you will see all of the dazzling detail that this disc has to offer.Supplements are very nice and give a good feel for the background of the show. The supplements are in HD as well, which is a nice bonus compared to many companies' tacked-on DVD leftovers.I do have questions about the idea of filming a Broadway show - while sometimes a closeup on a face can give a good aspect to the performance, other times, closeups really detract from a contextual viewing of the entire stage, which would be the viewer's experience live. On the whole, I guess it weighs out in favor of the good - live, you might be stuck behind someone's head or have a bad angle for certain parts of the stage.In summary, this is a total no-brainer for any fan of the show who has a good HD setup at home. The detail and immersion are absolutely top-notch.For someone who is a bit milder a musical fan (like me) there is a lot to like in this disc, in terms of technical excellence as well as artistic merit. So, where my wife might give it 5 stars, I would give it 4.

1215143,A25AXWGBGJ5KBS,B001LMAKAG,"M J Heilbron Jr. ""Dr. Mo""","[2, 2]","One of the most emotional and stirring Broadway experiences ever has been captured on film, and this is as good as it could possibly get.It is said that nothing recreates the sheer visceral thrill of a Broadway show...or I should say, a GOOD Broadway show. That particular alchemy of of live performance, plot/story, music and an audience is essentially un-reproducible in any other media.But MAN is this close!I started by referring to ""Rent"" as a Broadway ""experience"" more than a show. That's because the show is better the more you know about it.Beginning with the initial idea, the transposition of Puccini's ""La Boheme"", modernized to late 90's New York...is it too early to refer to that time period as ""turn of the century?""...it was a musical that was strikingly contemporary and exceedingly specific. Since it was masterfully done, it has also proved to be timeless and universal. They don't hand out Pulitzers for nothing.Knowing that the show's creator, Jonathan Larson, died of an undiagnosed thoracic aortic aneurysm the night before opening night previews, adds immeasurable subtext to a show about, among other things, living each day as if it were the last.Knowing the special relationship between the show, its' production crew, its' fans and the city of New York heightens the drama and intensity of the show itself, and here, the final performance.In other words, the story of ""Rent"" is as enthralling as the show itself. The documentary on the DVD of the FILM version of ""Rent"" does a terrific job of telling THAT story.And speaking about that film version...(which is never referred to during any of the several excellent behind-the-scenes segments here)...many die-hard Rent-heads have been quite vocal about their disdain for the film; critics were not that impressed either. Personally, I feel they did about as good a job as could have been done, without simply filming the show itself. Plus I got to see most of the original cast members, something I'd never otherwise get a chance to see.Like I said, nothing reproduces that sense of urgency and drama like live theater.THIS is that ""filmed show."" They literally filmed a Broadway performance. What seemed a bit dull in the movie bursts with color and vibrancy here.They cheat a bit; sometimes the cameras are right over the shoulders or in the faces of the cast members. That clearly didn't happen closing night. This is seamlessly edited together with previous performances using cameras on stage in the midst of the action. It is so well done that the close-ups add to the intensity. Seeing a cast member with a tear rolling down their cheek...something you couldn't see past the fourth row...just nails certain points in the show with that ""real"" drama you don't get from ""film"". It pulls you close.Hearing the roar of the crowd, either to applaud each performance or in some cases, to applaud in anticipation of an upcoming appearance (which is, I have to say, really cool to hear...) adds to the immediacy of your viewing experience. Seeing little imperfections, a little stumble, a vocal wobble, does the same thing. (For all I know, they were intentional...how the heck do I know...) The feeling of ""you are there"" has never been done as well as it has been done here.The show has become so personal to so many people, with so many fans seeing the original cast, the various Broadway iterations, the touring companies, the film, and now this, that they'll have their own favorite Mimi or Roger or Angel. This particular cast, I have to say, is pretty fine, top to bottom. Hardcore Rent-heads will find little to quibble about, and newbies won't be missing a thing. Yes, you might miss having Mimi a bit less polished (I always envisioned her character as a little ""sloppy"" or rough; here she sings perfectly)...and in my ""Rent"" world, Angel is usually more diminutive...more petite.Did this affect my watching this Blu-Ray? Not even remotely.In fact, I felt the same way I did when I saw the show for the first time, here in L.A. Then, I was so unexpectedly overwhelmed by the show, I was moved, as they say, to tears. Not the little, single drop that spills over your right eyelid either. Big messy sobs. From a 40-year-old heterosexual male. In public. Way embarrassing.Here, ""Rent"" got to me again. This time, knowing all that I know about the show, that sense of love and loss was just that much more profound. The tears came back, a bit more reserved this time, but continued throughout the compelling ""making-of"" segments.Technically, the disc is awesome. Awe-invoking. Awe-inspiring. Whatever. Awe. With the pristine vocals from and center, music presented on a huge soundstage and the raucous crowd swirling in your surrounds...I'm telling you, I was right there.Even the intermission...ten minutes long...is presented in its' entirety. Seriously. A camera sits stationary, maybe center front balcony, while a clock ticks down on screen. You see production crew moving things around, the tops of the heads of the people in the first rows milling about...it's kinda funny actually. At one point, a stage hand walks across the stage and waves to the camera.The video reproduction is impeccable. Only in the scenes where the lighting is necessarily super-low do you get any sort of image degradation...it's trivial. Otherwise, this looks so real. It's HD at it's finest. Again, ""you are there."" Only better.If you've read this far, there are a few things for you that I haven't written about, that you need to find out about on your own.1) You will go nuts during the encore...they do another song, with some friends showing up.2) You need to see each and every featurette. Stuff they show and talk about in the first ones comes back in the later ones. Things you think you know, you don't. You'll be moved beyond belief.3) If you've seen a lot of ""Rent"" shows, you will see old cast members in the audience, during the various featurettes. Check them out for that reason alone.This is not a rental...you need to own ""Rent."" Go. Click.

Though hailed as avant-garde at the time, hindsight reveals it to be a fairly traditional musical in structure and design and, truth be told, more cliche-ridden than anyone acknowledged.  All of that is evident in this film.  Jonathan Larson had a knack for writing delicious melodies, but he never met a lyrical cliche he didn't like. Nowhere is this more evident than in the ""La Vie Boheme"" section where the rather fresh-scrubbed ""bohemians"" carry on at length about ""anything taboo"" and something-or-other about revolution.  Anachronistic in 1996, it plays even worse now.  After a while, one starts to wonder what on earth all of these self-centered, ""faux"" bo-hos are carrying on about.  The other component that reeks of cliche is the insipid banality of the central lovebirds.  Typical ""ingenue / leading man"" material direct from central casting, the Mimi / Roger axis is easily the least interesting aspect of RENT and it stops the show dead in its tracks every time they take center stage.  It's ""boy meets girl...boy almost loses girl...boy gets girl in the end"".  That's not avant-garde...that's Andy Hardy.The staging of RENT has often been derided for bringing the actors to the lip of the proscenium to bellow their songs into the audience's face.  This is duly recorded here, and all that show-biz razzmatazz is at odds with the so-called bohemian world of the protagonists.  It does accomplish one very important task, however.  All of the razzle-dazzle disguises the fact that these folks are a self-absorbed bunch with little substance and lots of whining self-pity.  In other words, just what you'd expect from a roomful of actors.Still, there are those marvelous songs and Larson's ability is never more obvious than in the terrific set-piece ""Take Me or Leave Me"", which is a great showstopper.  ""Seasons of Love"" may be as much of a cliche now as the image of all of those miked actors, headsets at the ready, but that's because of the pedestrian staging.  The song is lovely and the actors in this performance are clearly relishing its message.  ""Will I Lose My Dignity..."" is a simple roundelay that is beautifully hymn-like, and the anthemic ""What You Own"" is a stirring eleven-o'clocker.  The actors in this performance are, by and large, both passionate and exuberant (""Roger"" and ""Mark"" excluded) and they serve the material well, and it helps that no one is famous because rather than star turns we get performances.  Edin Espinoza as the quixotic Maureen is the best sung rendition of this tricky part, and she brings an infectious urgency to everything she does.  The chemistry she and Tracie Thoms share creates a cohesion sometimes lacking elsewhere in this film, though Justin Johnson and Michael McElroy also stand out in the spotlight.  The most interesting aspect of the DVD, and the only reason to own it, is the inclusion of several short features documenting the final days of the RENT phenomenon.  Take it or leave it, RENT spent more than twelve years on Broadway and stirred a generation of actor-singers.  It's a seminal work which may not have aged well and is unlikely to speak to future generations, but it remains a time capsule that effectively captured a moment.

It gives a pretty good indication of what it feels like sitting in the audience, especially with the intermission included. The editing isn't great, but it's good enough to evoke what needs to be felt. The place where it breaks down is with the cast.Adam Kantor makes a passable Mark, but lacks the manic charm of Anthony Rapp. His vocals are solid and he does enough to carry the part.Will Chase is brutal as Roger though. His performance is more hammy than pained and his vocals get rather pitchy at times. Compare his version of ""One Song, Glory"" to Adam Pascal's version or the others who have filled the role and it just falls short. He's also pitchy at times and has to slide in to the right note too often. If intentional it's unfitting. It's a staple in country and even in some rock genres but sounds out-of-place in this context.Tracie Thoms and Eden Espinosa do a fine job in their roles as JoAnne and Maureen, respectively, but they're the only two who seem to give a perfarmance at least evocative of the original cast. Michael McElroy does a fine job, he's just not Jesse Martin which isn't ""fair"" I know as those are tough shoes to fill. Wilsone Jermaine Heredia was also a tough act to follow, and while Justin Johnston was good, again, tough shoes to fill.Renee Goldsberry is absolutely gorgeous as Mimi but just sems to be missing that extra bit of brassiness Daphne Rubin-Vega and others brought to the role.Casts change as actors move on and it's still a worthy performance.

1215158,A2IQUPNFOC79FT,B001LMAKAG,Vegan Marcos,"[1, 1]","I have had the privilege of seeing rent multiple times as well as auditioning for rent a few times too. I love this musical!!! The movie was a virtual disaster in the hands of Christopher Columbus. He is a talented director and fan of the show but he is not a director of movie musicals and Rent, like Godspell and Jesus Christ Superstar are true stage musicals that don't make an easy transition to the screen.That said, let's talk about this one. I'm gonna give you my quick comments and my wish list for what I wish had happened.Let me preface this quick review by stating that I ""own it"" on bluray. Ok, I'm not going to tell you the story of rent. There are plenty of people here that can do that and do a better job of it than me. This was Jonathan Larson's Magnum Opus! It is so unfortunate that he had a heart condition that was misdiagnosed. We lost him way too soon.Ok, now about the video. The stage, actors, colors and songs are glorious. Everyone is in fine form and I am thrilled that this ""one ticket event"" which was originally broadcast over a select period of days across the U.S. did find a home on dvd.Now for my wish list. To film a stage musical is a very difficult task. It requires a director that understands staging from A to Z. If you want to see an ""extraordinary"" example of what can be done with a stage musical on film then check out the stage version of Oklahoma with Hugh Jackman. The director who shot Oklahoma have anywhere from ten to sixteen cameras on and around the stage. He wanted his audience to truly feel like they were sitting in the show and he left nothing to chance. This was the brilliance of Trevor Nunn. He had originally staged the musical for the London stage and knew exactly what kind of experience he wanted to create.This is not the case with Rent. In the hands of Trevor Nunn this would have been an ""extraordinary"" film document of Rent. Unfortunately, it will have to settle for very good. That's not a bad thing but it could have been better. As it stands it will always be the musical for ""this generation"". This musical will stand the test of time and people will still be talking about the brilliance that was recognized ""too late"" in 200 years when they speak about Mr. Larson.So, get this movie. Enjoy it. It is very good. However, the camera moves around on the stage and follows the actors but you're not seeing the play from an audience perspective for a good portion of the time you're only seeing parts of the stage. I suspect only two or three cameras were used. If more had been used, as in Oklahoma, you would be seeing the entire, glorious stage at all times. As it is there are times when people are singing and you know there are others on stage but you can't see them. This is part of the enjoyment of the theatre goer.

This high octane, musically innovative and striking show is also a beautiful and heartfelt exploration of youth, both lost and reclaimed; a very poignant portrait of the search for love and compassion, of hope and beauty in a world that everyday recedes deeper into the empty comforts of materialism and social acceptability.  An updated version of Puccini's masterpiece La Boheme, Rent is obviously not as shy about not only examining the wounds of its characters but of exhibiting them; its blatant honesty and unapologetic credo of life are a million miles away from the subtle, innocent and elegant sentiments of late 19th century Parisian artists, starving in their garrets while courting muses.  Rent is the ""black sheep"" of the Boheme lineage.  It's a piece of theatre that bristles with tenacity in the face of hardship and rejection:  No one here is willing to take anything lying down.  It's really little wonder it was as critically acclaimed as it was and won the many prestigious awards that it did and reason for that is that it manages to be what few musicals have ever managed to be:  Authentic, relevant but, ultimately, profoundly human; a rebellious celebration of life even in the face of addiction, illness and death .  Add to that mixture some really first rate music, stellar performances and stage direction (an ingenious arc that fluidly shifts its characters around Manhattan yet all within the confines of a stage that's, for the most part, barren) and you've got one heck of a winning recipe.  Rent is the musical for people who think they don't like musicals.  It's as far removed from traditional American musical theatre as it possibly can be.  It is the heir apparent to the socially relevant, politically conscience and in your face musical experience that was ushered in 40 years ago by the groundbreaking rock musical ""Hair.""  But, of course, the most tragic element about Rent was the premature death of its creator, Jonathan Larson, who, sadly and ironically, died the day before opening night, a few days shy of his 36th birthday.  But what a legacy he left us all.",5,"Great concept, beautifully done",1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,2392,"['saw', 'show', 'stage', 'highly', 'stylized', 'film', 'version', 'having', 'now', 'experienced', 'performance', 'filmed', 'live', 'Broadway', 'end', 'show', 'run', 'now', 'truly', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'short', 'film', 'version', 'really', 'capturing', 'essence', 'what', 'Jonathan', 'Larson', 'created', 'high', 'octane', 'musically', 'innovative', 'striking', 'show', 'also', 'beautiful', 'heartfelt', 'exploration', 'youth', 'lost', 'reclaimed', 'very', 'poignant', 'portrait', 'search', 'love', 'compassion', 'hope', 'beauty', 'world', 'everyday', 'deeper', 'empty', 'comforts', 'materialism', 'social', 'acceptability', 'updated', 'version', 'Puccini', 'masterpiece', 'La', 'Boheme', 'Rent', 'obviously', 'not', 'shy', 'not', 'only', 'examining', 'wounds', 'characters', 'exhibiting', 'blatant', 'honesty', 'unapologetic', 'credo', 'life', 'are', 'million', 'miles', 'away', 'subtle', 'innocent', 'elegant', 'sentiments', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'Parisian', 'artists', 'starving', 'garrets', 'courting', 'muses', 'Rent', 'black', 'sheep', 'Boheme', 'lineage', 'piece', 'theatre', 'tenacity', 'face', 'hardship', 'rejection', 'one', 'here', 'willing', 'take', 'anything', 'lying', 'down', 'really', 'little', 'wonder', 'was', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'was', 'won', 'many', 'prestigious', 'awards', 'did', 'reason', 'be', 'what', 'few', 'musicals', 'have', 'ever', 'managed', 'be', 'Authentic', 'relevant', 'ultimately', 'profoundly', 'human', 'rebellious', 'celebration', 'life', 'even', 'face', 'addiction', 'illness', 'death', 'Add', 'mixture', 'really', 'first', 'rate', 'music', 'stellar', 'performances', 'stage', 'direction', 'ingenious', 'arc', 'fluidly', 'shifts', 'characters', 'Manhattan', 'yet', 'confines', 'stage', 'most', 'part', 'barren', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'heck', 'winning', 'recipe', 'Rent', 'musical', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'musicals', 'far', 'removed', 'traditional', 'American', 'musical', 'theatre', 'possibly', 'can', 'be', 'heir', 'apparent', 'socially', 'relevant', 'politically', 'conscience', 'face', 'musical', 'experience', 'was', 'ushered', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'groundbreaking', 'rock', 'musical', 'Hair', 'course', 'most', 'tragic', 'element', 'Rent', 'was', 'premature', 'death', 'creator', 'Jonathan', 'Larson', 'who', 'sadly', 'ironically', 'died', 'day', 'opening', 'night', 'few', 'days', 'shy', '36th', 'birthday', 'what', 'legacy', 'left']",N/A
