502550,AK0CENM3LUM28,B00000IBUG,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Wrath of the Ninja / B00000IBUG*Spoilers*Unfortunately, it's often easy to tell when an anime movie is a complete series distilled into a single feature film, and ""Wrath of the Ninja"" is a good example of this. The movie starts off well, with the initial and hostile meeting of two of the (as yet unknown) chosen trio of ninjas, only to have their battle interrupted by a new, and frightening, common opponent.Despite this interesting hook in the beginning, though, the movie quickly rushes into gibberish, falling victim to doing too much in too short a time span. After episodic events such as an enemy attack, the film will leap forward several seasons, with a quick exposition voice over that leaves far too much unexplained for the uninitiated to follow. The result is a film that will be unsatisfying for everyone - fans of the series will be irritated by how much was cut; new viewers will be confused and finally bored with the sequence of apparently unconnected events that leave no real emotional impact in their wake.""Wrath of the Ninja"" isn't a *bad* movie in the traditional, awful sense - but it's rushed and frenetic and confusing. In order to meet the feature film length, motivation and character development have been almost entirely cut. In its place, the writers have dropped a bunch of cliches and stereotypes to prop up the action, and I suppose if they were happy with a mediocre, cliche-ridden film then good for them, but most viewers are going to be disappointed, and it's particularly infuriating to be lost for the entire movie because the politics and warfare strategies couldn't be explained a little further, but they DID find time to have the Wangsty male ninja hit up on the Serious female ninja with the obligatory ""you're not being feminine enough"" guilt stick. Oh, yeah, and the movie commits the cardinal sin of the ""Bait and Switch Boss"" trope, which is truly bad enough in video games but should never, ever be used in movies.I wouldn't really recommend ""Wrath of the Ninja"", but it's not the worst movie in the world. Oddly, it's one of the few anime movies where the English subtitles for the hearing impaired actually match the English dubs a little bit, which is pleasant in and of itself.~ Ana Mardoll",3,"Another series falls victim to a rushed, frenetic movie version",1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,2245,"['Wrath', 'Ninja', '/', 'B00000IBUG*Spoilers*Unfortunately', 'often', 'easy', 'tell', 'when', 'anime', 'movie', 'complete', 'series', 'distilled', 'single', 'feature', 'film', 'Wrath', 'Ninja', 'good', 'example', 'movie', 'off', 'well', 'initial', 'hostile', 'meeting', 'two', 'yet', 'unknown', 'chosen', 'trio', 'ninjas', 'only', 'have', 'battle', 'interrupted', 'new', 'frightening', 'common', 'interesting', 'hook', 'beginning', 'though', 'movie', 'quickly', 'gibberish', 'falling', 'victim', 'doing', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'span', 'episodic', 'events', 'such', 'enemy', 'attack', 'film', 'will', 'leap', 'forward', 'several', 'seasons', 'quick', 'exposition', 'voice', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'unexplained', 'uninitiated', 'follow', 'result', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'unsatisfying', 'everyone', 'fans', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'irritated', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'cut', 'new', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'confused', 'finally', 'bored', 'sequence', 'apparently', 'unconnected', 'events', 'leave', 'real', 'emotional', 'impact', 'wake', 'Wrath', 'Ninja', ""n't"", '*bad*', 'movie', 'traditional', 'awful', 'sense', 'rushed', 'frenetic', 'confusing', 'order', 'meet', 'feature', 'film', 'length', 'motivation', 'character', 'development', 'have', 'been', 'almost', 'entirely', 'cut', 'place', 'writers', 'have', 'dropped', 'bunch', 'cliches', 'stereotypes', 'prop', 'up', 'action', 'suppose', 'were', 'happy', 'mediocre', 'cliche-ridden', 'film', 'then', 'good', 'most', 'viewers', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'particularly', 'infuriating', 'be', 'lost', 'entire', 'movie', 'politics', 'warfare', 'strategies', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'explained', 'little', 'further', 'DID', 'find', 'time', 'have', 'Wangsty', 'male', 'ninja', 'hit', 'up', 'Serious', 'female', 'ninja', 'obligatory', ""'re"", 'not', 'being', 'feminine', 'enough', 'guilt', 'stick', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'movie', 'cardinal', 'sin', 'Bait', 'Switch', 'Boss', 'trope', 'truly', 'bad', 'enough', 'video', 'games', 'should', 'never', 'ever', 'be', 'used', 'movies.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'Wrath', 'Ninja', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'world', 'Oddly', 'one', 'few', 'anime', 'movies', 'where', 'English', 'subtitles', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'actually', 'match', 'English', 'little', 'bit', 'pleasant', 'itself.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Wrath of the Ninja

502552,A2CLUVY0XTPRZK,B00000IBUG,H. Thompson,"[10, 11]","This movie is very poorly done.  And I'm not just talking about the anime itself, I'm talking about how they took the OVA series (300+ minutes) of this and cut it down into a movie (87 minutes).  I'm glad this doesn't happen to all anime series, that would be for shame.The movie itself isn't that bad, its just I cannot give this DVD, nor any butchered version of the OVA series a good rating.  The series features 3 ninjas fighting against Nobunaga Oda (an evil ruler at one time in Japan's history) as they try and stop his attempts to take over the world.  The movie is kind of a beast/ninja movie which would fare over well for some viewers, but it failed to capture my interest.With all of my personal opinons aside, the DVD itself does include some good extras.  With deleted scenes being the key extras on the disc, it also has a ""meet the cast"" option as well with the traditional U.S. MANGA ""DVD Sneak Peaks"".Overall, I'm sad that this could-be great anime was delivered in such a poor way.  If you can overlook the fact that you won't be seeing the entire movie no matter what when you buy the DVD (even if they give you 2-3 deleted scenes), then you should probably pick this up.  Also, if you are a fan of the ninja/demon beast genre it wouldn't hurt to check it out.",2,A Horrible Reincarnation,1021507200,"05 16, 2002",2002,1280,"['movie', 'very', 'poorly', 'done', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'anime', ""'m"", 'talking', 'how', 'took', 'OVA', 'series', '300+', 'minutes', 'cut', 'down', 'movie', '87', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'glad', ""n't"", 'happen', 'anime', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'shame.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'DVD', 'butchered', 'version', 'OVA', 'series', 'good', 'rating', 'series', '3', 'ninjas', 'fighting', 'Nobunaga', 'Oda', 'evil', 'ruler', 'one', 'time', 'Japan', 'history', 'try', 'stop', 'attempts', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'movie', 'kind', 'beast/ninja', 'movie', 'would', 'fare', 'over', 'well', 'viewers', 'failed', 'capture', 'interest.With', 'personal', 'opinons', 'aside', 'DVD', 'include', 'good', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'being', 'key', 'extras', 'disc', 'also', 'meet', 'cast', 'option', 'well', 'traditional', 'U.S.', 'MANGA', 'DVD', 'Sneak', 'Peaks', '.Overall', ""'m"", 'sad', 'could-be', 'great', 'anime', 'was', 'delivered', 'poor', 'way', 'can', 'overlook', 'fact', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'seeing', 'entire', 'movie', 'matter', 'what', 'when', 'buy', 'DVD', 'even', 'give', '2-3', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'then', 'should', 'probably', 'pick', 'up', 'Also', 'are', 'fan', 'ninja/demon', 'beast', 'genre', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'check', 'out']",Wrath of the Ninja

502557,A1HAZ9VUYLXIFY,B00000IBUG,Saint,"[0, 0]","I will start off by saying that this is not the greatest anime film/ova that I have ever seen, but it is still pretty good. I suppose I may have a higher opinion of this ova than some others will and that may be because I saw this when I was still pretty young and it was also one of my first expierences with anime. While the plot can be somewhat spotty at times I think that overall if you remain open minded about it you should be able to enjoy it. They story is an interesting twist on the historical japanses warlord Nobunaga Oda and his right hand general Ranmaru Mori repainting the two as demons. What follows in an intriguing story of 3 ninjas from different schools uniting to end Nobunaga's reign of evil. Along the way our three heroes encounter a few intersting allies as well as the Host of Oboro including the 7 Oboro ninja, Nobunaga's top generals/assassins. Again while the plot can be a bit thin at times most of the fights are pretty good. Overall I would probably give this an 8/10, but I may be a little generous with that rating.

502558,A369SQ6E2IP3G5,B00000IBUG,Susan Shams,"[31, 39]","I love Anime. I bought this DVD version for one reason and one reason alone. So that I would not have to watch or listen to the dubbed version. I cannot stand the English dubbing. My advise to anyone watching a foriegn film; watch it in its original language, no one else can do the characters justice. That is my opinion.Anyways, that matter aside, let's talk about the movie.Yes, it has extremely graphic violence, but it states that on the DVD. (Contains brief nudity and Graphic Violence, Parental Discretion Advised). Gore is not what this anime is about. There is actually a great historical storyline interwoven within all its action and suspense.3 Ninjas from different clans unite to ward off Evil. Each Ninja with their own special sword, come together as one. Evil is rampant, Lord Nobunaga Oda with his evil intentions sends out all his evil artillery to smash the Ninjas and thier allies. His goal, to spread evil and demons throughout the land.Ayame, is a young girl who sees her life and family shattered before her innocent eyes, yet she is helpless to do anything. Vengeance becomes her lifelong obsession. Ryoma, a Ninja from a neighboring clan, kindhearted and sweet is her companion and ally. And of course, Sakon (my favorite guy) is the Ninja who can feel the treachery of those around him, and sees the battles and evil as never ending.I will not say anymore, but I seriously recommend this movie.
