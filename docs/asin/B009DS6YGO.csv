If not, then start there not here with set seven!Foyle's War: The Home Front Files Sets 1-6Of course, this review is influenced by how I feel about sets 1-6!  So, I won't go into who Foyle is or where and when this drama takes place. :-)  After seeing sets 1-6, I'm betting you'll want to see set seven!I love Michael Kitchen as Christopher Foyle.  Plain and simply, Foyle is my favorite character of this genre.  So, I was anxious to receive the latest offering of Foyle.  Kitchen is still marvelous as Foyle.  In this installment, Foyle remains brilliantly astute, keeping his head while others are losing theirs, shrewd, logical, loyal (to his ""driver"" Sam and to his country) and overall the man of morality/character that drew me to him. (He also continues to have a great BS detector which I must say is much needed in his new position! Indeed!)How I came to rate this feature with four stars is by averaging between the five stars I give Michael Kitchen for his remarkable portrayal of Foyle given the script he had to work with and three stars for the story line. Bottom line, I will purchase Set Eight if there is one.I just didn't like the format of finding Foyle in MI-5.  He was practically shanghaied getting off of the ship from America by little more than emotional blackmail to assist MI-5 because Sam (played by Honeysuckle Weeks, his driver from previous episodes) was implicated as a spy.  In order to prove Sam innocent, Foyle felt he could not say no even though he clearly wanted to refuse.  I liked his loyalty and belief in his former colleague by coming to her rescue (so to speak). That is pretty much the plot of episode one in this series.  Of course Sam wasn't a spy (no spoiler there, that's a given) and after proving she wasn't, why Foyle then agreed to continue at MI-5 baffled me.  I really thought that he should have told them, NO! and then gone fishing and waited until he received a better offer from another avenue that appreciated his keen mind. :-) I also didn't get why MI-5 wanted him so badly when throughout the entire three episodes he was undermined, underused, and pretty much mistreated. It seemed as if he wasn't needed, wanted or valued in any way. I just didn't like Foyle being relegated to a position of little standing; I preferred him as Chief Superintendent. The political intrigue was too excessive and disturbing for me. This new set is a type of drama, heavily political, that I don't care for. I like crime solving as the main component with respect shown toward those characters who deserve it.  I would have liked to have seen Foyle return in a role of Superintendent solving crimes.  In the previous six sets there were always instances where Foyle was underestimated but by the end of the episode he came out on top. If you've seen the previous episodes I hope you understand what I mean. Even though the war had ended, war-torn England and all the country was suffering could still have been portrayed with occasional instances of political intrigue (which was effectively shown in the previous six sets of this series.)Also, while I am glad that Honeysuckle Weeks returned I was not bowled over by her story line and the sub-plots she and her husband brought to the overall tale. I haven't decided if she married well.  I'll have to go back and watch the previous episodes, from set six, and see if that helps me decide.All in all, I love Christopher Foyle.

Rather it is now become an espionage drama.  That said, it is still top-notch.  We loved it and will continue to order new sets if and when they become available.  The tone is much darker.  While WWII was obviously a terrible time for the Brits (and the rest of the world), there was more of a sense of getting through it together, which seemed to make everyone stronger.  This is a new, secret war, being fought outside of common knowledge.  It wasn't a shared effort, in fact, there was quite a bit of doubt about who was an enemy and who was not.  Suspicion is an attitude that darkens our hearts and lives.

As excellent as the British home-front WWII series. Perfection in period dramatizing history, with action, romance, mystery, and suspense. Communism and traitors are new issues. Storylines are based on real people/events, confirms Anthony Horowitz (creator & writer of 2 episodes).Foyle's War is a modern classic, indisputably the FINEST war and now post-war drama and crime mystery combo ever produced. Foyle reigns.Michael Kitchen continues playing Foyle, driving himself. Kitchen is a master at facial expression and line delivery timing. He says much without voice. What joy! 'Sam' (Honeysuckle Weeks) returns in all 3, now married, but these 2 reconnect in odd ways. The tradition of perfection in detail continues in sets, locals (filmed in period-rich Ireland), costumes, and props. Each episode retains the fact that there are subplots, thus multiple stories all at once, intricately woven in precision. Hastings local crime has changed to London and MI5 (Brit homeland security started even before WWI or II).SUBTITLES for three 90+ min episodes plus the entire bonus (longer than an episode).THE ETERNITY RING--1945-46Foyle returns from America only to be drawn under MI5 threat into a Russian spy adventure. Sam's married Adam Wainwright (Daniel Weyman, all 3 eps) a politician, they involved in plot and subplot. She works with a nuclear scientist and lives in a post-war prefab. Eternity ring is code for a Soviet spy ring. Nicholas Jones is Sir Wm chambers; Ellie Haddington returns as Hilda Pierce (in all 3 eps) a top MI5 position; and Glenvil Harris is Jeremy Swift in all 3 eps.THE CAGE--June, 1946Another true story inspired this spy segment where Lt Col Galt (Jonothan Hide) is held in the cage. Rationing and food shortage remains causing many to ask ""What was the war for?"" NKDV adds mystery when again Foyle deals with murder. Tim McMullen (played in all 3 eps) is agent Valentine, in charge of safehouses gone wrong. MI5 gets a new head, Rupert Vansittart fills the role in this and the next episode.SUNFLOWER--1947 with 1944 war back storyWill a stalked ex-Nazi (Lars Eidinger) be assassinated before Foyle can help him? MP Wainwright has his own story in politics and helping constituents. Teacher Thomas's (Charles Aitken) story is about his return from the front with shock, now PTSD. 1944 ""Sunflower"" operation was a real Nazi war crime event now dramatized.BONUS:A.

I then purchased Series 6 and was very disappointed in it because it was awful.  It was my belief that the creator of Foyle's War had lost his touch and therefore I had no interest in seeing the newest series.  But on an impulse, I bought the newest series.  When I started watching, I thought I had made a huge mistake in buying this.  The music was different, cinematography was different, and the stories seemed different.  But the more I watched it, I realized that the creator had done a wonderful job of incorporating Foyle and Samantha into the Cold War era.  The music and cinematography reflected that change so beautifully and helped me to put the stories into the right context - England starting its recovery from the war.  One reviewer said that they wanted Foyle to go back to Hastings.  But it became clear to me that the writers were showing how things had changed, even in Hastings.  One of the soldiers who arrived in London after the war was from Hastings and he told Foyle that his home at been ""bombed out"" and his family had relocated to London.  This is one clue to the viewer that Hastings was no longer the beautiful seaside city and had also been changed by the war.Christopher Foyle brought all his skills and talents to an agency that did not operate the same way as his Hasting police force.  It was interesting to watch both Foyle and the MI5 agents adjusting to each other.  Each of the three episodes were like full length movies.  I enjoyed the twists and turns in the plots during all the episodes. I highly recommend this series.

It is my understanding that there will be more Foyle's War  episodes and that they are currently being filmed.  I hope he goes back to Hastings; a much lovelier setting than London.

1595767,A28YDMI499J1X9,B009DS6YGO,J. Janssen,"[1, 1]","While only offering three new episodes, Jill Green and Anthony Horowitz have crafted a smooth transition for former Chief Inspector Foyle and Samantha Wainwright (nee Stewart) into post war England.  There will no doubt be some who were anticipating an American chapter where Foyle hunts down Howard Paige from ""50 Ships"" but the first episode, ""The Eternity Ring"", begins with Foyle's return from America.  He's immediately approached by MI5 to join the murky world of spy rings and double agents.  Reluctant, he tries to resist but Sam is implicated in the story's plot and Foyle must intervene in order to save her from prosecution.  As a result Sam winds up working for the organization as Foyle's assistant.  With DI Milner presumably at the police constabulary in Brighton, Sam's husband, Adam becomes a secondary lead as he wins his seat in Parliament and figures prominently in the third episode, ""Sunflower"".These have a  darker, more sinister feel than the war time episodes and some might miss the Hastings seascapes, but I found the transition to be very well done and offering the potential for more dramatic diversity as the series plays out.  While much of the WW2 story lines included depictions of the sacrifices and hardships Britain suffered, it also showed a public largely pulling together for the patriotic cause.  By comparison the post war ushers in a more byzantine era where trust and patriotism can no longer be taken for granted.  The final episode ends with an uncharacteristically somber Foyle questioning the future.  And though Sam is pleasantly surprised to discover she's pregnant, it's still an uncertain future for her as husband Adam finds that doing the right thing as a Member of Parliament doesn't always work out for the best.  There were few glorious moments in the Cold War and no battlefield victories by which to gauge who was winning.  Horowitz has crafted near perfect dramas that convey the uncertainty the late 1940's brought to a nation already exhausted by years of war.  The development of the Adam Wainwright character brings the element of social justice and politics into the mix and illustrates just how difficult it can be to recover from a major war even when you win.As usual there's ancillary information in the bonus feature conveying how the stories follow, or differ, from the actual events they're based on.  Additionally, Tony Horowitz has a video prelude to each episode in which he sets up the circumstances and background while noting areas of dramatic license and why it was taken.  The episodes were largely shot in Dublin, a stand in for post war London, as the smaller city offered a more authentic backdrop with period Georgian architecture and narrow streets.  Cost over-runs stemming from a quest for authenticity were largely responsible for ITV's original cancelation and rushed completion of series 4 & 5.  It's hopeful the Dublin location will reduce production costs to a more manageable level, possibly allowing for a four episode Series 8.  As has been the case since the end of Series 5 there's always some doubt as to whether additional episodes will be forthcoming.  The final scene in ""Sunflower"" was ambiguous at best, but both Green and Horowitz sounded positive about their desire to move forward.  Additionally, Acorn has indicated in press releases ""there are more episodes scheduled for next year"" and they ""hope for many more seasons"". It should be noted however that Michael Kitchen is now 65, an age when Brit TV detectives start heading for their vegetable gardens and Cornish cottages. He once famously said that he refused to end his career as a doddering TV detective pondering retirement, so savor the episodes we have, but pray for more.",5,Smooth Transition to Post War Espionage,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,3738,"['only', 'offering', 'three', 'new', 'episodes', 'Jill', 'Green', 'Anthony', 'Horowitz', 'have', 'crafted', 'smooth', 'transition', 'former', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Foyle', 'Samantha', 'Wainwright', 'nee', 'Stewart', 'post', 'war', 'England', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'who', 'were', 'anticipating', 'American', 'chapter', 'where', 'Foyle', 'down', 'Howard', 'Paige', '50', 'Ships', 'first', 'episode', 'Eternity', 'Ring', 'Foyle', 'return', 'America', 'immediately', 'approached', 'MI5', 'join', 'murky', 'world', 'spy', 'rings', 'double', 'agents', 'Reluctant', 'resist', 'Sam', 'implicated', 'story', 'plot', 'Foyle', 'must', 'intervene', 'order', 'save', 'prosecution', 'result', 'Sam', 'up', 'working', 'organization', 'Foyle', 'assistant', 'DI', 'Milner', 'presumably', 'police', 'constabulary', 'Brighton', 'Sam', 'husband', 'Adam', 'secondary', 'lead', 'seat', 'Parliament', 'figures', 'prominently', 'third', 'episode', 'Sunflower', '.These', 'have', 'darker', 'more', 'sinister', 'feel', 'war', 'time', 'episodes', 'might', 'miss', 'Hastings', 'seascapes', 'found', 'transition', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'offering', 'potential', 'more', 'dramatic', 'diversity', 'series', 'out', 'much', 'WW2', 'story', 'lines', 'included', 'depictions', 'sacrifices', 'hardships', 'Britain', 'suffered', 'also', 'showed', 'public', 'largely', 'pulling', 'together', 'patriotic', 'cause', 'comparison', 'post', 'war', 'ushers', 'more', 'byzantine', 'era', 'where', 'trust', 'patriotism', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'taken', 'granted', 'final', 'episode', 'uncharacteristically', 'somber', 'Foyle', 'questioning', 'future', 'Sam', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'discover', 'pregnant', 'still', 'uncertain', 'future', 'husband', 'Adam', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'Member', 'Parliament', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'out', 'best', 'were', 'few', 'glorious', 'moments', 'Cold', 'War', 'battlefield', 'victories', 'gauge', 'who', 'was', 'winning', 'Horowitz', 'crafted', 'perfect', 'dramas', 'uncertainty', 'late', '1940', 'brought', 'nation', 'already', 'exhausted', 'years', 'war', 'development', 'Adam', 'Wainwright', 'character', 'element', 'social', 'justice', 'politics', 'mix', 'just', 'how', 'difficult', 'can', 'be', 'recover', 'major', 'war', 'even', 'when', 'win.As', 'usual', 'ancillary', 'information', 'bonus', 'feature', 'conveying', 'how', 'stories', 'follow', 'differ', 'actual', 'events', ""'re"", 'based', 'Additionally', 'Tony', 'Horowitz', 'video', 'prelude', 'episode', 'up', 'circumstances', 'background', 'noting', 'areas', 'dramatic', 'license', 'why', 'was', 'taken', 'episodes', 'were', 'largely', 'shot', 'Dublin', 'stand', 'post', 'war', 'London', 'smaller', 'city', 'offered', 'more', 'authentic', 'backdrop', 'period', 'Georgian', 'architecture', 'narrow', 'streets', 'Cost', 'over-runs', 'stemming', 'quest', 'authenticity', 'were', 'largely', 'responsible', 'ITV', 'original', 'cancelation', 'rushed', 'completion', 'series', '4', '5', 'hopeful', 'Dublin', 'location', 'will', 'reduce', 'production', 'costs', 'more', 'manageable', 'level', 'possibly', 'allowing', 'four', 'episode', 'Series', '8', 'been', 'case', 'end', 'Series', '5', 'always', 'doubt', 'additional', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'forthcoming', 'final', 'scene', 'Sunflower', 'was', 'ambiguous', 'best', 'Green', 'Horowitz', 'sounded', 'positive', 'desire', 'move', 'forward', 'Additionally', 'Acorn', 'indicated', 'press', 'releases', 'are', 'more', 'episodes', 'scheduled', 'next', 'year', 'hope', 'many', 'more', 'seasons', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'however', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'now', '65', 'age', 'when', 'Brit', 'TV', 'detectives', 'start', 'heading', 'vegetable', 'gardens', 'Cornish', 'cottages', 'once', 'famously', 'said', 'refused', 'end', 'career', 'doddering', 'TV', 'detective', 'pondering', 'retirement', 'so', 'savor', 'episodes', 'have', 'pray', 'more']",Foyle's War: Set 7

In the first episode, Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle is drafted by MI5 to help investigate a spy case involving the Soviets and a possible Eternity spy circle.  This new series opens with a bang - literally - as the A-Bomb is detonated in New Mexico.  The Soviets want the A-Bomb and Foyle's smarts are enlisted to help prevent a spy ring from obtaining information or materials regarding it.Foyle's former driver, Samantha, is encountered by Foyle and she helps in the investigation. Her husband is running for a Parliament seat.  It appears that MI5 will make good use of Foyle this season and Samantha will go along for the ride.  Speaking of ride, love the autos, fashion, and architecture of this time period.  I prefer the Cold War actually as a setting for a mystery so am delighted with the new direction and possibilities of this series this season - it will be interesting to see what other reviewers think.In the second episode, a young woman is missing, a dead body turns up and a scientist is murdered in his home.

In two of the episodes, Foyle deals with cases where the Soviet intelligence service murders British nationals and Soviet defectors.  Granted, Russian ""diplomats"" acted very thuggishly at times, but I don't believe for a moment that in that time frame, they would have dared to act that way on British soil.Another thing that bothered me was an episode where Foyle commissioned a former Special Operations Executive operative to break into a covert British military intelligence base and rescue a British citizen who was mistakenly abducted after being confused with another woman by the same name.  I really, REALLY doubt that something like that could have happened.I was also disappointed by the way that the dangling plot thread from the great Foyle's War episode ""50 Ships"" was resolved.  When we last saw Foyle before this season, he was embarking on a ship to America to catch up with a murderer who had escaped justice due to pressing national security interests.  I thought this would have made an ideal episode for the series...""Foyle in America.""  But instead, that plot thread is resolved by saying that the murderer killed himself apparently in response to a threat of arrest or exposure instigated by Foyle.&lt;spoilers end>I can't help but contrast improbable plot developments like those cited above with the stories that took place in World War II. I felt that those had a ring of authenticity to them and what made them interesting was the fact that WWII in the Home Islands created some pretty unique and fascinating criminal cases for Foyle to solve that wouldn't have happened at any other time.So to sum up, I'm not sorry I bought the DVD of this collection, but I'm going to watch the next set of episodes if there are any before buying that DVD set.***Coda after watching the third episode of the season:&lt;spoilers>I found myself lowering my initial three star rating of this set to two stars after watching ""Sunflower.""  It was good up until the very end.  The premise was okay and based on some historical fact...that allies made use of German intelligence operatives who had blood on their hands in the aftermath of WWII.  Where it ran off the rails was the resolution.  Foyle had figured out that MI5 had faked the death of one such German it was making use of.  Foyle had confronted the German at an airfield but seemed resigned to the fact that the man was going to slip through his fingers.Then in a truly implausible deus ex machina, a couple of American military officers come up and apprehend the German to face trial for ordering the shooting of American prisoners in 1944 in France.  Foyle did not tip the Americans off but another disaffected MI5 operative did.  The Americans take the German into custody and the credits roll.C'mon.  Britain was a sovereign nation back in the aftermath of WWII.  The idea that two American military officers could detain someone who was under the protection of the British Government gives new meaning to the term absurd.And it's worth pointing out that the United States did not exactly have an immaculate record in terms of Germans it used for intelligence activities.  One such individual was Klaus Barbie, the ""Butcher of Lyon.""  We made use of this Nazi thug despite the French demanding that we hand him over to them and helped him flee to South America.The truth is that boatloads of Germans and their collaborators escaped consequences for hideous crimes they committed during WWII.  Most of them did so without assistance of Western intelligence services.  But the ones who were lucky enough to have ""friends"" were particularly likely to evade justice...which Barbie did until decades later.",2,Foyle Doesn't Work Quite as Well in the Cold War as He Did in WWII,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,4276,"['know', ""'m"", 'going', 'highly', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'latest', 'instalment', 'Foyle', 'War', 'getting', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'join', 'enthusiastic', 'praise', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'series', 'still', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'thanks', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'endearing', 'Honeysuckle', 'Weeks', 'scenes', 'settings', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'give', 'good', 'idea', 'drab', 'cheerless', 'place', 'post-WWII', 'austerity', 'Britain', 'was.', 'lt', 'spoilers', '>', 'just', 'switching', 'Foyle', 'being', 'policeman', 'being', 'MI5', 'security', 'agent', 'have', 'resulted', 'plot', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'strike', 'terribly', 'realistic', 'two', 'episodes', 'Foyle', 'deals', 'cases', 'where', 'Soviet', 'intelligence', 'service', 'murders', 'British', 'nationals', 'Soviet', 'defectors', 'Granted', 'Russian', 'diplomats', 'acted', 'very', 'thuggishly', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'moment', 'time', 'frame', 'would', 'have', 'dared', 'act', 'way', 'British', 'soil.Another', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'episode', 'where', 'Foyle', 'commissioned', 'former', 'Special', 'Operations', 'Executive', 'operative', 'break', 'covert', 'British', 'military', 'intelligence', 'base', 'rescue', 'British', 'citizen', 'who', 'was', 'mistakenly', 'abducted', 'being', 'confused', 'woman', 'same', 'name', 'really', 'REALLY', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'happened.I', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'way', 'dangling', 'plot', 'thread', 'great', 'Foyle', 'War', 'episode', '50', 'Ships', 'was', 'resolved', 'When', 'last', 'saw', 'Foyle', 'season', 'was', 'embarking', 'ship', 'America', 'catch', 'up', 'murderer', 'who', 'had', 'escaped', 'justice', 'due', 'pressing', 'national', 'security', 'interests', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'ideal', 'episode', 'series', 'Foyle', 'America', 'instead', 'plot', 'thread', 'resolved', 'saying', 'murderer', 'killed', 'apparently', 'response', 'threat', 'arrest', 'exposure', 'instigated', 'Foyle.', 'lt', 'spoilers', 'end', '>', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'contrast', 'improbable', 'plot', 'developments', 'cited', 'stories', 'took', 'place', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'felt', 'had', 'ring', 'authenticity', 'what', 'made', 'interesting', 'was', 'fact', 'WWII', 'Home', 'Islands', 'created', 'pretty', 'unique', 'fascinating', 'criminal', 'cases', 'Foyle', 'solve', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'happened', 'other', 'time.So', 'sum', 'up', ""'m"", 'not', 'sorry', 'bought', 'DVD', 'collection', ""'m"", 'going', 'watch', 'next', 'set', 'episodes', 'are', 'buying', 'DVD', 'set', '***Coda', 'watching', 'third', 'episode', 'season', 'lt', 'spoilers', '>', 'found', 'lowering', 'initial', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'set', 'two', 'stars', 'watching', 'Sunflower', 'was', 'good', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'premise', 'was', 'okay', 'based', 'historical', 'fact', 'allies', 'made', 'use', 'German', 'intelligence', 'operatives', 'who', 'had', 'blood', 'hands', 'aftermath', 'WWII', 'Where', 'ran', 'off', 'rails', 'was', 'resolution', 'Foyle', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'MI5', 'had', 'faked', 'death', 'one', 'such', 'German', 'was', 'making', 'use', 'Foyle', 'had', 'confronted', 'German', 'airfield', 'seemed', 'resigned', 'fact', 'man', 'was', 'going', 'slip', 'fingers.Then', 'truly', 'implausible', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'couple', 'American', 'military', 'officers', 'come', 'up', 'apprehend', 'German', 'face', 'trial', 'ordering', 'shooting', 'American', 'prisoners', '1944', 'France', 'Foyle', 'did', 'not', 'tip', 'Americans', 'off', 'disaffected', 'MI5', 'operative', 'did', 'Americans', 'take', 'German', 'custody', 'credits', ""roll.C'mon"", 'Britain', 'was', 'sovereign', 'nation', 'back', 'aftermath', 'WWII', 'idea', 'two', 'American', 'military', 'officers', 'could', 'detain', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'protection', 'British', 'Government', 'new', 'meaning', 'term', 'worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'United', 'States', 'did', 'not', 'exactly', 'have', 'immaculate', 'record', 'terms', 'Germans', 'used', 'intelligence', 'activities', 'One', 'such', 'individual', 'was', 'Klaus', 'Barbie', 'Butcher', 'Lyon', 'made', 'use', 'Nazi', 'French', 'demanding', 'hand', 'helped', 'flee', 'South', 'America.The', 'truth', 'boatloads', 'Germans', 'collaborators', 'escaped', 'consequences', 'hideous', 'crimes', 'committed', 'WWII', 'Most', 'did', 'so', 'assistance', 'Western', 'intelligence', 'services', 'ones', 'who', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'friends', 'were', 'particularly', 'likely', 'evade', 'justice', 'Barbie', 'did', 'decades', 'later']",Foyle's War: Set 7

1595799,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B009DS6YGO,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","After the last couple of season's of ""Foyle's War"", I didn't have high expectations for a new post-War series. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that Series 7 (Series 8 in the UK) has much better writing than Series 5 and 6, during which characters seemed to devolve into superficial collections of mannerisms, behavior was sometimes far-fetched, and plots often weak. ""Foyle's War"" is now the Cold War, and the series has moved from the south coast of England to London. Great Britain still needs Christopher Foyle's talents of detection, now in the interest of Cold War counterespionage. Miss Pierce (Ellie Haddington), formerly of the Special Operations Executive, is now highly placed in MI5, where she's joined by Arthur Valentine (Tim McMullen), an underling who doesn't quite trust Foyle. Samantha Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks), now Wainwright, has moved to London with her husband Adam (Daniel Weyman), who is pursuing a career in politics.Sam's domestic situation highlights some of the social issues prominent in Great Britain after the War: food shortages, high crime, unemployment. But there is a sense of optimism for the future, which Adam Wainwright deeply believes, as he campaigns for a national health service. The series is critical of Cold War intelligence agencies, though this may be intended to reflect dissatisfaction with the current and recent behavior of those agencies rather than as historical commentary. Secrets are a common theme, as spy agencies seem to spend as much time keeping secrets from each other and from other agencies as they do collecting intelligence. Foyle tends to expend a lot of energy trying to figure out what is going on within his own department. MI5's methods, including torture, and the many moles in British government agencies are also at issue.The first two episodes of Series 7, ""The Eternity Ring"" and ""Cage"", are terrific espionage thrillers with complex plots that keep the audience guessing. ""Sunflower"" is not quite as good and focuses more on the politics of alleged Nazi war criminals and moral compromise in the face of a perceived Soviet threat. Before this new series, I thought that Foyle was a character that we didn't need to see any more of, but the writers have risen to the occasion and given us a good Cold War detective series. I hope they can keep it up. ""The Eternity Ring"" and ""Sunflower"" were written by series creator Anthony Horowitz; ""The Cage"" was written by David Kane. The episodes are:Upon returning from his trip to the United States, Foyle is intercepted by MI5 agents who insist that he accompany them to London in ""The Eternity Ring"". Special Operations Executive has been ""wound down"" since the war and transformed into a new counterintelligence agency. Sir William Chambers (Nicholas Jones), at its head, requests, against the advice of Miss Pierce (Ellie Haddington), that Foyle assist in investigating an alleged ring of spies who are passing nuclear secrets to the Soviets. Foyle is believed to have a connection to the case, in that his former driver Sam Stewart -now Samantha Wainwright, now employed as the secretary of nuclear scientist Michael Fraser (Stephen Boxer), has been photographed passing something to a known Soviet agent. Hoping he can help, Foyle learns that his employers are keeping as many secrets as their enemies.Foyle is officially on the MI5 payroll in ""The Cage"", and his first case is to find out who is responsible for betraying information about safehouses in which 3 Soviet defectors have been murdered. Sam starts work at the agency and tries her best to do whatever research Foyle requires, while her husband campaigns for the upcoming election in which he hopes to be made a Labour MP. A Russian man (Rad Kaim) has recently stumbled into a hospital bleeding to death and only able to utter one phrase to the doctor on duty: ""ten eye."" Meanwhile, a suspected Soviet agent has successfully fled to East Berlin, and Arthur Valentine will probably be blamed. And Sam's husband is trying to help a woman in his district whose daughter has gone missing. For Foyle, all roads seem to lead to a military base called Barton Hall, whose post-War mission is not entirely clear.In ""Sunflower"", Sir Alec (Rupert Vansittart), head of MI5, asks Foyle to assess the risk to former Nazi SS officer Karl Strasser (Lars Eidinger), who is living in London under the guise of a Dutch art expert, while he provides MI5 with valuable intelligence on Soviet spy networks. Strasser believes that his life is in danger, because a man is following him, and someone is leaving ominous objects at his home. Meanwhile, Sam's husband Adam has to deal with a constituent who believes that the land he sold to the government before the War has been deliberately over-valued in order to prevent him from buying it back. This episode is less a detective story than a rumination on the moral compromises made in the name of the ""greater good"", as persons of power in Parliament and MI5 break the law to advance agendas based on their own value judgments.",5,"Pleasantly Surprised to See ""Foyle"" Resurrect Itself after a Couple of Sub-Standard Series.",1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,5051,"['last', 'couple', 'season',

The episodes are darker; the acting a bit angrier, as if disillusionment has seeped into every business, every home, every character.

There is a lack of life, or spark if you will in Mr Foyle, and Sam seems downright ill.

However, the stories themselves were very simplistic.  I was never on edge over who the bad guys were, there was no building of suspense, no tension other than regretting the loss of the quality and life that the series is now sadly missing.

I saw all of the previous episodes, and now we have three new ones.The Second World War is over and the Cold War is upon us. The time of spies, and sleuths. Foyle has returned from the US, and due to some interesting circumstances he is asked to work for MI5. As fate would have it, he happens upon his driver from the War, Sam Weeks. She is in a boring job and the chance to work with Foyle again is superb. She is also married, and her husband, Adam, is running for the Labour MP.  Adam is an idealistic you g man wanting to do Goid work for his constituents and his country. Interestingly enough, the issues facing Adam are also part of the cases Foyle is facing.Foyle is also idealistic and in the second episode he is asked to investigate the death of a Russian informant. Thus investigation takes him to some interesting areas, one is a secret house that is using some untoward acts to interrogate prisoners. At the same time, Adam's campaign manager wants to use some nefarious means to publicize the negatives of his opponent. Adam does not want anything to do with kind of campaigning, but can he shop it and still be elected.As always, Sam is the colleague who knows, sees and does a great deal to help Foyle. Her job as driver is a ruse of sorts. She should really share billing. She is not so subtle at times, just like Foyle. Foyle also likes to accomplish good works, and he does this as often as he can. He is sometimes not looked at as someone with authority, but he has no problem earning that title very quickly. The MI5 team recognizes this and recognize how important he is to their organization.PBS's Masterpiece Theatre has shown two of the episodes, with the third episode to be shown this week. This is a series without too much violence, more intellectual and footwork are part of the practice.

1595822,A1EUI8FA4KNV95,B009DS6YGO,Rissi,"[55, 59]","Outcry and popular demand brought about additional installments of the wildly popular crime drama Foyle's War chronicling the cases of a keen British detective protecting the home front while a world is at war. Penned by Anthony Horowitz, the most recent installments may honor the end of one war but begins the start of a new, equally threatening one.England is not the same place it once was. The horrors of a second world war are still raw in the minds of the people and upon his return to his homeland Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is reminded of the stark remnants. Just back from America, two things consecutively happen soon as he sets foot on British soil. He meets again with a former policeman he once worked with in Hastings just released from spending years as a POW and his services are requisitioned by MI5 leading him again into the acquaintance of the formidable Miss Pierce (Ellie Haddington). Disinterested in working for the government spooks, Foyle is compelled to help them uncover a Russian spy ring known as ""The Eternity Circle"" until he learns they are looking at Sam (Honeysuckle Weeks) as a suspect when presented with photographic evidence. Not believing that his former driver could in any way be involved, Foyle agrees to help MI5 in order to make sure no harm comes to Sam and her politically minded husband, Adam (Daniel Weyman).Pushing forward in his investigation, Foyle learns that working among his colleagues involves learning the ins and out of politics - and that protecting the wrong people is MI5's business. He soon discovers there are more shady dealings going on inside the walls of the MI5 offices rather than out, and it becomes a question of figuring out who is trustworthy and who is not.Nothing ever stays the same. This is something we know, but golly, it's hard when we have to wave good-bye to such a beautiful piece of nostalgia. And if we were honest, this series is just that. Not in the traditional sense, this series experienced a gripping identity to its stories and more poignant moments than any unsuspecting viewer would ever expect, we are now given a duller, less shiny version of that. Where it once managed to be quaint and terribly brilliant, it feels as if there's a weight on the shoulders of everyone. Seeing this come to a close was the end of an era and seeing it return (in 2011) was a joyous occasion, one that seemed unable be matched and upped. Now, a new year brought us three all new installments and people, oh my stars are you in for unexpected and sometimes, sad changes.Instead of moving viewers with the things that easily humanized the stories - like the needless, tragic deaths of those on the home front - missing in these new installments is the same focus on people, now the angles zero in on political schemes and governments protecting former war enemies. It's a new mine field for everyone to navigate, leaving us and oftentimes Foyle more exasperated than satisfied justice is being served. The first few minutes of `Eternity Circle' starts out well presenting a group of people who possess a very dangerous, terrifying knowledge before it kind of fizzles out. The character's seemed only half-hearted, the mystery written poorly and not at all as intelligent as some of the prior chapters. Part of me understands the emotions of this series - a long and hard fought war is still fresh in the mind of these people, and another part misses all the spunk, humor and cleverness of what this series built itself on. Fortunately, the final episode is the best of the group (more on this later) and also has a wonderful conclusion to what seemed an untouchable situation.Those who are unfamiliar with this series may suffer in places from a lack of knowledge as the show references an American entrepreneur who once escaped Foyle's reach or the history there is between Samantha Stewart (now Wainwright) and Foyle, and has undergone some (glaringly) obvious shortcomings and changes from what was once a more ""solid,"" character relationship. Sam is no longer the same plucky girl we laughed with and ended up loving; now she seems weary and less up for a bit of sleuthing whereas before she was eager and willing to do nearly anything. There is one scene involving her husband's political run that was typical Sam and for a moment, we were again reminded of who the old Sam was and it was a ray of sunshine. She and Adam are cute together (in rare moments of spontaneity) but if memory serves correct, I preferred the actor who portrayed this character in the last series better.Where the first two installments aren't the best of the bunch (humbly, this is just my opinion and as with any form of entertainment, fans may disagree with that), 'Sunflower' is brilliant! Saving it for last was a great strategy as it whets our anticipation, wanting more and it's all the harder to say good-bye when the screen goes black. (Plus Foyle gets an epically good moment at the end!) It is dark as it covers a frightening period of the war and counteracts these tendencies by offering the human side of the story through Foyle's eyes and his determination to always look for truth and justice in those investigations. Avid fans will pick up on the little changes. They add up and offer new perspectives, sometimes for the better, oftentimes they leave the show worse for the wear as if the war took its toll behind the lens of this history piece of cinematic entertainment - there is a dullness where once this was a bright copper penny; the creativity seems ""zapped."" That being said, don't let my cynical ramblings ruin anything, any fan of this ITV series (myself included!) will enjoy set seven - it's really the bees knees; Horowitz puts out another solid edition of mystery, mayhem and of course, the keen investigative eye of Christopher Foyle is on the case.

Take Foyle away from the charming English town he lives in, remove him from his elegant house on a lovely street, and put him in the mean streets of London with litle to do except walk around in his long raincoat and interview people. (Just imagine Doc Martin without Port Isaac.)2. Remove the recurring and very likeable characters who formerly surrounded him and replace them with a bunch of unappealing blowhards.3. Keep one of the important characters, (Samantha), but make her little more than a paper shuffler and wife of an MP. Make all scenes with her and her husband unspeakably dull and pointless.4. Forget the lovely theme music that added character and texture to previous episodes and replace it with some weird music that's right out of a B movie.5. Film as many scenes as you can in grey, light grey, brown, and dark grey.6. Make the story lines so confusing and convoluted that even Foyle could not solve them without help. Make the stories go on forever with more talk than action in order to bore your audience as much as you can.7.

Watching this series, one becomes a part of the story as well as the characters.
