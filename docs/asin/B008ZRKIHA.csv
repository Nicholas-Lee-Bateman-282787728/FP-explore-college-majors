1578962,A15P6JXOSIN2TG,B008ZRKIHA,"Jalynn Patterson ""pattersonmom24""","[1, 2]","My Thoughts:This movie was a very touching tribute to those of us that go above and beyond to search out and achieve the call God has placed on our lives. God calls us all to glorify Him and to be on a mission to win souls. But many of us are called to go past that into even broader territory. This film focuses on the lives of five friends all seemingly going into different places in their lives only to be brought back and bound together for a mission that one could not finish.The purpose of the calling isn't the calling it is about Him and the character of the individual. Too many times we are afraid to do what He is calling us to do. Maybe afraid that we don't measure up, that we are not equipped for ""the call"". But don't you see that this is something God will place in us all. He equips the called. He wants us to depend on Him to get us through it. He will be there each step of the way to guide you and to help you be the best you can be in Him.This movie was a tear jerker for sure. Our family has had a call place on it by the Almighty when my husband was called to be a minister. So we know a little about the trials and tribulations that a call of that magnitude can bring. So many of the issues addressed here really hit home for us. We really enjoyed it. If you would like to win your own copy, now is your chance.

April 16, 2013This DVD is about an actual place through Embrace a Village, a ministry to those with leprosy disease and their families in India. Embrace a Village, a Christian non-profit organization based in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, exists to help transform the lives of leprosy victims and their families: Our mission is to bring Jesus Christ's message of hope and healing. To achieve our vision within each leprosy colony, we raise the standard of living for leprosy victims across India and help them to help themselves integrate back into mainstream Indian society through relief projects, education and spiritual ministries. Embrace a Village is a 501(c)(3) organization. Donations are tax deductible. You can learn more at embraceavillage.org. The story is fictional, but with a strong message of courage, love, and compassion. Ethan, Luke, Al&eacute;, Ryder and Catherine are five friends connected by their strong faith. After graduation, they each set out to make a difference in the world for God. Their ambitions are high, their passions are strong but will they have the courage to fulfill their calling regardless of what comes their way? The sacrifice they are asked to pay may just be too high. Through godly wisdom from an outside source, the group realizes that this is not their time after all, it's all His! Come along with these new graduates as they discover who they are to be, rather than what they are to do. This is God's time as we yield our lives to Him, and allow Him to do through us.What I liked about this movie is the interaction between the characters facing hard things:* separation after being together as they each begin their paths after graduation* standing up for Truth in decision-making values* the uncertainty of being accepted to grad school* grieving loss* being fired from a job to find the ultimate job by giving for the good of others* being able to reveal and talk about true feelings* building trustThe movie flows very fluidly without gaps, and is viewable by all ages. Color, 104 minutes.Pure Flix is a Christian movie studio that produces, distributes, and acquires Christ centered movies for the sole purpose of changing our culture for Christ, one heart at a time.

As the credits rolled down the screen, I just sat there, quiet and thoughtful.  I remember the conquer the world, I can do anything elation of college graduation.  This story portrayed a gamut of emotions and experiences young adults can face after the final exams are history.  This is Our Time is so relevent, not only to young adults, but to older adults, too.  There are many of us who feel like life has passed us by, or we should be changing the world.  Instead, we're just doing our everyday thing.  God has purpose for us, in us, and through us.  I've reviewed many movies, but this one really stands out.  It's not a feel good movie, it's a deep thought movie.  I think it is well worth your time and attention.I watched this with my family.  If you're concerned about the leprosy, it is not shown during the movie.  It is safe to watch with your family.  There is a three minute video at the end that explains the ministry of Embrace a Village in India.

The movie was very specifically Christian. It was coming from a Christian worldview. The characters each talked openly about God's plan for their lives.2. The theme was thought-provoking and relevant for young adults. Certainly most young adults question God's will and plan for their lives. They can relate to this movie.3. Not just the ""missionaries"" were doing God's will in this movie. Every character was portrayed as following God's will for them specifically, and no job was portrayed as more important or more valuable for God.Not so great:1, Unfortunately this movie fell into the trap that I see many Christian films fall into. Conversations about God seem forced and scripted instead of natural and flowing. Even the actors' emotions seem planned and not real2. Even though the film's topic is aimed at young adults, I don't think it will appeal to many because much of the story is spent in philosophical thought instead of action.I'm glad more and more Christian film producers are coming. I'm glad to see more specifically Christian films made. I think this one has the potential to teach much to young adults. I'm afraid that it won't be real and compelling enough to draw their attention, but I hope that many will look beyond some of those things I didn't like to hear the great message in this film.I received a free copy of this DVD for review purposes.

In the book The Gospel Centered Woman Wendy talks about the ""prosperity gospel of conservative Christianity"" -- the notion that if we are living for God, doing His will, and following what the Bible says we're supposed to do then our lives will go well and we'll be blessed. I do find that this tends to be the way we thinks as Christians--so how do we respond when we're serving God and tragedy strikes?This is the center theme to This Is Our Time  which follows the lives of five different students after they graduate from college. Each has great challenges to overcome as they seek what they should be doing and who they should become.I had mixed feelings on this movie. On the one hand I loved the theme and I especially loved how the amazing ministry of Embrace a Village was highlighted--if you've never heard of it please check it out, wow! The film was very family friendly and the shooting and cinematography was nice, and I enjoyed seeing Erin Bethea  again (the wife on Fireproof).I don't feel that I can give this movie five stars, however. My hubby, ever the film critic, watched it with me and he commented that the whole movie was very heavy and depressing. While we both realized that there were weighty thing being shown throughout the movie, we also both felt that the need for comic relief in between those scenes just wasn't met by the corny punch lines scattered in here and there. Especially considering other recently released Christian films who also dealt with incredibly difficult topic lines and but managed to get genuinely side splitting scenes in between I feel the bar has now been raised in the Christian film industry. Low budget acting and corny punch lines just don't cut it anymore.That being said I would overall rate this movie a 4. It definitely delivers on being a family friendly, Christian film and watching it with your older kids could prove to lead to some really valuable discussions about our expectations in life and the difference of the realities and also what God might be calling them to do!",4,Nice Family Film-but missing a little something,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,2161,"['When', 'expectations', 'life', 'have', 'head', 'collision', 'reality', 'life', 'faith', 'can', 'get', 'tested', 'max', 'book', 'Gospel', 'Centered', 'Woman', 'Wendy', 'talks', 'prosperity', 'gospel', 'conservative', 'Christianity', 'notion', 'are', 'living', 'God', 'doing', 'will', 'following', 'what', 'Bible', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'do', 'then', 'lives', 'will', 'go', 'well', ""'ll"", 'be', 'blessed', 'do', 'find', 'be', 'way', 'thinks', 'Christians', 'so', 'how', 'do', 'respond', 'when', ""'re"", 'serving', 'God', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'center', 'theme', 'Time', 'lives', 'five', 'different', 'students', 'graduate', 'college', 'great', 'challenges', 'overcome', 'seek', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'who', 'should', 'become.I', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'loved', 'theme', 'especially', 'loved', 'how', 'amazing', 'ministry', 'Embrace', 'Village', 'was', 'highlighted', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'check', 'out', 'wow', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'family', 'friendly', 'shooting', 'cinematography', 'was', 'nice', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Erin', 'Bethea', 'again', 'wife', 'Fireproof', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'can', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'however', 'hubby', 'ever', 'film', 'critic', 'watched', 'commented', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'heavy', 'depressing', 'realized', 'were', 'weighty', 'thing', 'being', 'shown', 'movie', 'also', 'felt', 'need', 'comic', 'relief', 'scenes', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'met', 'corny', 'punch', 'lines', 'scattered', 'here', 'there', 'Especially', 'considering', 'other', 'recently', 'released', 'Christian', 'films', 'who', 'also', 'dealt', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'topic', 'lines', 'managed', 'get', 'genuinely', 'side', 'splitting', 'scenes', 'feel', 'bar', 'now', 'been', 'raised', 'Christian', 'film', 'industry', 'Low', 'budget', 'acting', 'corny', 'punch', 'lines', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'cut', 'anymore.That', 'being', 'said', 'would', 'overall', 'rate', 'movie', '4', 'definitely', 'being', 'family', 'friendly', 'Christian', 'film', 'watching', 'older', 'kids', 'could', 'prove', 'lead', 'really', 'valuable', 'discussions', 'expectations', 'life', 'difference', 'realities', 'also', 'what', 'God', 'might', 'be', 'calling', 'do']",This Is Our Time

Pure Flix presents This Is Our Time, a way to seize God's calling! Starring Erin Bethea (Fireproof) as Al&egrave; and her husband Luke (T.J. Dalrymple) who marry shortly after their graduation from college, and feel the calling of going to India as part of Embrace A Village ministry. This ministry cares for those afflicted with leprosy and their families. Their friends from college Catherine (Kate Cobb), an aspiring financier, who joins a prestigious financial institution determined to make an impact on corporate American; Ryder (Matthew Florida), who lands an impressive job in social media and can't wait to use the powerful medium for a greater good; and Ethan (Shawn-Caulin Young), seemingly the odd man out, who struggles to find his God-given purpose and feels sidelined by God.""What they all come to learn is that it never really was their time, but always was, always is, God's time.""This movie is so powerful because there is a sense that we can all relate to a character in the movie. Even those that seem to have it all made, find themselves struggling with some of the business ethical choices in their jobs, so it's not always as green on the other side as some would see. I found myself relating to the character of Catherine because it sometimes means having to make hard choices in your job. I myself, found that leaving a job after ten years despite the prestige and salary that may it hard to give up, required me to simply walk away and never look back. At the time, the decision was a hard one and one I found myself questioning quite a bit during my first year, especially when my family just bought a new home and two incomes were almost required. However, I found with God's assurance, we were able to make it just fine and He paved the way in unpredictable ways, much like He does in all the characters in this movie. Sometimes we have to get to the end of the path before we can see clearly because the whole time we were simply too close to the situation.I received This Is Our Time by Pure Flix compliments of Flyby Promotions for my honest review and received no compensation for a favorable review. This movie really hit home with me as a stay at home mom for the last ten years now wondering if I was sacrificing what God wanted me to do for something bigger and more impactful. However, after watching this one, I am content with where God has placed me and until such a time that He asks me to move in another direction, I will do my best with what I can. A great family movie with a profound moral message. For those wondering where God's at in your life in any situation, this is the movie for you.

Often times in my life I've wondered and even questioned God's timing and the answers never seem to come easy.A group of friends, one a brother and sister pair, graduate from college and enter the real world to fulfill their dreams. While most feel called to a certain purpose, Ethan is left struggling with what his future will bring. The plans for graduate school immediately following college don't come to fruition and he gets stuck in a dead end job working for his dad.Ethan watches his newlywed sister and her husband travel to India to work for Embrace a Village where they believe they have been called to serve. His two best friends get jobs in the fields of their choosing and he seems to be the only one left behind and stuck in a place he doesn't want to be.I could relate to Ethan on so many levels. I never knew what I wanted to be when I grew up and floundered in college taking years longer than needed simply because I couldn't focus and had no direction. I saw my friends go off and fulfill their dreams while I hadn't even figured out what mine were yet. Like Ethan I often questioned God's timing and even where he was when bad things happened.When unspeakable tragedy strikes, Ethan is left shell shocked and even more confused about his purpose and why something so awful happened. But as many men before him in the Bible discovered, it is often through the darkest hours that God's purpose is brought to the light. Ethan finds his purpose, hope and a future when his faith is restored.Sometimes dreams are shattered and sometimes they don't look like what we thought they were supposed to. But God has his hand in all of it and this is a great reminder of that.This is our Time is an amazing movie that I hope every teenager and college aged person should watch.
