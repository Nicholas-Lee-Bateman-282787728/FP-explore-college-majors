The problem is that that would require that you actually CARE about the one-dimensional characters. So it winds up too watered down to appeal to the average guy, and too gross and unromantic to appeal to the average girl. Who cares if he gets the girl at the end? The relationship is portrayed as pretty messed up, so why would anyone even want it to be saved?

And every time there was even a hint of a ""warm and fuzzy moment"" it paid off with another dose of humor.

Both Brand and Hill are comedy brilliance, but this is in no way as funny asForgetting Sarah Marshall (Two-Disc Unrated Collector's Edition). What I did enjoy about this film was the rather dark comedy hiding underneath the surface. And where most comedies would pull back into a safety zone of zany laughs, this one had the balls to confront the dark side of Aldous Snow (Brand) in the scene where he falls from a roof into a pool and smacks his side on the cement. As the red of his blood fills the pool, Snow confronts Aaron Green (Hill) about just how bitter his life is. I was in awe of this scene and the remainder of the film as it went a way I didn't see coming. Now, there was at least one uncomfortable scene (it involves Hill, Brand and Hill's girlfriend, Elisabeth Moss), but I could overlook it. Still, not as funny as ""Sarah Marshall.""

A comedy about a rock icon (Aldous Snow, played by Russell Brand, who is basically playing himself) on the south side of his career--a rocker with a taste for debauchery that makes Attila the Hun look like a boy scout--GET HIM TO THE GREEK is a road flick, a 72-hour sojourn from London to LA, with record intern Aaron Green (an almost somber Jonah Hill) entrusted with getting the legendary merrymaker to the west coast in time to perform a comeback concert.  Of course, chaos ensues, and it's three steps back for every two steps forward, as Aaron tries to contain Aldous's vices long enough to get him on a plane or in a TV studio--with poor Aaron often getting the worse of the alcohol, drugs, and groupies.It's hysterically funny; Brand was born to do outrageous comedy like this, and he's remarkably believable as a hard-charging yet vulnerable artist.  I'm usually ambivalent when it comes to Hill, but here he plays off Brand's zaniness with goggle-eyed aplomb.  (Featuring a constant expression akin to, ""What truck just hit me?"")  The ensemble is fantastic, but my goodness, was I pleasantly surprised by Sean Combs as record mogul Sergio.  Combs has fantastic comedic talent.  The Las Vegas fight scene is rib-splitting (literally).Finally, this comedy scores another triumph by its spoof of Aldous's music.  From the opening music video, 'Africa's Child', to Aldous's signature anthem, 'The Clap', to his ex, Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) performing the naughty, yet hysterical, 'Around the Posey', to the film's final tune, 'Furry Walls', the musical spoof is as dead on as it is golden comedic bliss.  One star off for the nonsense and silliness of it all, but if you're looking for laughs GET HIM TO THE GREEK, the sooner the better.--D.

1303395,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002ZG97PG,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 5]","There are moments that are laugh-out-loud riotous and there are others that are purely head-scratching, but the net effect of this raunchy, often clever 2010 anti-buddy comedy directed by Nicholas Stoller is genuinely positive. This is his second feature after 2008'sForgetting Sarah Marshall, which served as the introduction to Russell Brand's character, Aldous Snow, a sexed-up, heroin-abusing, non-sequitur-spouting British rock star. In this screenplay co-written by Stoller and Jason Segel (who also co-wrote and starred in ""Sarah Marshall""), Aldous has been on the skids since the release of a publicly reviled album called ""African Child"" - denounced as the worst thing to happen to Africa since apartheid.What's worse is that Spice Girls-inspired pop star Jackie Q, his longtime girlfriend and mother of his child Naples, has left him for Lars Ulrich, the longtime drummer for Metallica. Meanwhile, Sergio Roma, a megalomaniacal label executive, is about to release Aldous from his contract when puppyish young staffer Aaron Green comes up with the high-risk idea of a comeback concert in LA, marking the 10th anniversary of Aldous' landmark show at the Greek Theater. The rest of the story is aHangover-type road movie of sorts between Aaron and Aldous, as Aaron has to fetch the rock star in London and get him to LA in time for the concert three days away. Predictably, nothing goes as planned as Aaron, in the throes of a sudden break-up with his overworked hospital intern girlfriend Daphne, gets seduced by Aldous' narcissistic excesses.What becomes less predictable is how Stoller and Segel choose to deepen Aldous enough to give the character a sense of introspection about his besotted life, including a side trip to Vegas where he reunites with his estranged father, a guitarist for a Rat Pack tribute show who is jealous of his son's success. At the same time, Roma is in hot pursuit to make sure Aaron does his job, and everyone gets involved in a drug-fueled ml&eacute;e that should serve as the definitive anti-drug commercial. Brand completely stole ""Sarah Marshall"" from his cast mates, including Kirsten Bell, who played the title role and shows up in an unexpected cameo. Given this is a vehicle for his character, he manages to show more dimension to Aldous without losing sight of his hilarious comic creation (his opening video is hysterically tasteless). In a comparatively more constrained role, Jonah Hill manages to be regular-guy funny and brings surprising heart to put-upon Aaron.Together Brand and Hill convey a convincing sense of trust between the characters despite their opposite tendencies. On the sidelines, Rose Byrne shows real comic chops as the uninhibited Jackie Q, while Elisabeth Moss of ""Mad Men"" makes Daphne far more than the wet rag she is set up to be in the story. Colm Meaney effectively plays Aldous' embittered father during the film's most serious scene, while Sean Combs is quite funny - in a good way - as Roma. It should come as no surprise that this whole venture was produced by Judd Apatow since his fingerprints are everywhere given all the comic and often crass male bonding throughout. Stoller's uneven direction explains the fluctuating variations in the movie's tone, and like every Apatow movie, the film runs about twenty minutes too long for the slight story being told. Brand and Hill, however, make an engaging duo no matter what.",4,An Unexpected Comic Pairing Brings Laughs and Surprising Resonance to an Apatow Factory Farce,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,3407,"['are', 'moments', 'are', 'laugh-out-loud', 'riotous', 'are', 'others', 'are', 'purely', 'head-scratching', 'net', 'effect', 'raunchy', 'often', 'clever', '2010', 'anti-buddy', 'comedy', 'directed', 'Nicholas', 'Stoller', 'genuinely', 'positive', 'second', 'feature', ""2008'sForgetting"", 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'served', 'introduction', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'character', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'sexed-up', 'heroin-abusing', 'non-sequitur-spouting', 'British', 'rock', 'star', 'screenplay', 'co-written', 'Stoller', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'starred', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Aldous', 'been', 'skids', 'release', 'publicly', 'reviled', 'album', 'called', 'African', 'Child', 'denounced', 'worst', 'thing', 'happen', 'Africa', 'apartheid.What', 'worse', 'Spice', 'Girls-inspired', 'pop', 'star', 'Jackie', 'Q', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'mother', 'child', 'Naples', 'left', 'Lars', 'Ulrich', 'longtime', 'drummer', 'Metallica', 'Meanwhile', 'Sergio', 'Roma', 'megalomaniacal', 'label', 'executive', 'release', 'Aldous', 'contract', 'when', 'puppyish', 'young', 'staffer', 'Aaron', 'Green', 'up', 'high-risk', 'idea', 'comeback', 'concert', 'LA', 'marking', '10th', 'anniversary', 'Aldous', 'landmark', 'show', 'Greek', 'Theater', 'rest', 'story', 'aHangover-type', 'road', 'movie', 'sorts', 'Aaron', 'Aldous', 'Aaron', 'fetch', 'rock', 'star', 'London', 'get', 'LA', 'time', 'concert', 'three', 'days', 'away', 'Predictably', 'nothing', 'as', 'planned', 'Aaron', 'throes', 'sudden', 'break-up', 'overworked', 'hospital', 'intern', 'girlfriend', 'Daphne', 'seduced', 'Aldous', 'narcissistic', 'excesses.What', 'less', 'predictable', 'how', 'Stoller', 'Segel', 'choose', 'deepen', 'Aldous', 'enough', 'give', 'character', 'sense', 'introspection', 'besotted', 'life', 'including', 'side', 'trip', 'Vegas', 'where', 'estranged', 'father', 'guitarist', 'Rat', 'Pack', 'tribute', 'show', 'who', 'jealous', 'son', 'success', 'same', 'time', 'Roma', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'make', 'sure', 'Aaron', 'job', 'everyone', 'involved', 'drug-fueled', 'ml', 'eacute', 'should', 'serve', 'definitive', 'anti-drug', 'commercial', 'Brand', 'completely', 'stole', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'cast', 'mates', 'including', 'Kirsten', 'Bell', 'who', 'played', 'title', 'role', 'up', 'unexpected', 'cameo', 'Given', 'vehicle', 'character', 'show', 'more', 'dimension', 'Aldous', 'losing', 'sight', 'hilarious', 'comic', 'creation', 'opening', 'video', 'hysterically', 'tasteless', 'comparatively', 'more', 'constrained', 'role', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'be', 'regular-guy', 'funny', 'surprising', 'heart', 'put-upon', 'Aaron.Together', 'Brand', 'Hill', 'convey', 'convincing', 'sense', 'trust', 'characters', 'opposite', 'tendencies', 'sidelines', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'shows', 'real', 'comic', 'chops', 'uninhibited', 'Jackie', 'Q', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Daphne', 'far', 'more', 'wet', 'rag', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'story', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'effectively', 'Aldous', 'embittered', 'father', 'film', 'most', 'serious', 'scene', 'Sean', 'Combs', 'quite', 'funny', 'good', 'way', 'Roma', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'whole', 'venture', 'was', 'produced', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'fingerprints', 'are', 'everywhere', 'given', 'comic', 'often', 'crass', 'male', 'bonding', 'Stoller', 'uneven', 'direction', 'fluctuating', 'variations', 'movie', 'tone', 'Apatow', 'movie', 'film', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'slight', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'Brand', 'Hill', 'however', 'make', 'engaging', 'duo', 'matter', 'what']",N/A

The only problem is that Aldous Snow is a total drug head who has been living in England and self destructing since his last album tanked and this former girlfriend (played by Rose Byrne) decided to tell the world she was leaving him during an interview on national TV.Aaron is sent to England to bring Snow to LA for the concert by his boss, record producer Sergio Roma (played by Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs).  Aaron finds out for himself just how hard it is to get a lonely and conceited Rock and Roll legend to act right and do anything that he is told to do even if it means singing to his adoring fans and generating lots of money.This movie is a Rock and Roll bro-mance between Aaron and Aldous as they behave badly on two continents and finally ""find themselves"" dispute Aldous' very bad behavior.  There are cameo appearances from Pink, Christina Aguilera, Katy Perry and many other music stars.  Even Meredith Vieira from The Today Show makes an appearance as herself for a very funny interview segment.  When the chemistry is right between the actors and jokes are on point, the movie is great.  But the movie falls short in that some of the jokes and physical humor fall apart at times and just are not funny.  Also, Sean Combs could do with just a few more acting lessons. But, if you like the world of Rock and Roll and graphic adult humor, you will enjoy this movie.This move earns its ""R"" rating with filthy language, explicit drug use, graphic female and male nudity, bathroom sex, oral sex, and threesome which are all totally Rock and Roll, but definitely not  kid friendly so make sure the little ones are asleep before you see this movie.",3,Seriously Outrageous!,1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,2066,"['Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 'straight', 'up', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'story', 'music', 'lover', 'record', 'company', 'employee', 'Aaron', 'Green', 'played', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'who', 'up', 'wonderful', 'idea', 'generating', 'tons', 'money', 'record', 'company', 'having', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'legend', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'played', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'perform', 'one', 'night', 'concert', 'celebrate', '10', 'year', 'anniversary', 'famous', 'first', 'concert', 'Greek', 'theater', 'only', 'problem', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'total', 'drug', 'head', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'England', 'destructing', 'last', 'album', 'tanked', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'decided', 'tell', 'world', 'was', 'leaving', 'interview', 'national', 'TV.Aaron', 'sent', 'England', 'bring', 'Snow', 'LA', 'concert', 'boss', 'record', 'producer', 'Sergio', 'Roma', 'played', 'Sean', 'P.', 'Diddy', 'Combs', 'Aaron', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'hard', 'get', 'lonely', 'conceited', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'legend', 'act', 'right', 'do', 'anything', 'told', 'do', 'even', 'singing', 'adoring', 'fans', 'generating', 'lots', 'money.This', 'movie', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'bro-mance', 'Aaron', 'Aldous', 'behave', 'badly', 'two', 'continents', 'finally', 'find', 'dispute', 'Aldous', 'very', 'bad', 'behavior', 'are', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Pink', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'Katy', 'Perry', 'many', 'other', 'music', 'stars', 'Even', 'Meredith', 'Vieira', 'Today', 'Show', 'appearance', 'herself', 'very', 'funny', 'interview', 'segment', 'When', 'chemistry', 'right', 'actors', 'jokes', 'are', 'point', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'short', 'jokes', 'physical', 'humor', 'fall', 'apart', 'times', 'just', 'are', 'not', 'funny', 'Also', 'Sean', 'Combs', 'could', 'do', 'just', 'few', 'more', 'acting', 'lessons', 'like', 'world', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'graphic', 'adult', 'humor', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie.This', 'move', 'R', 'rating', 'filthy', 'language', 'explicit', 'drug', 'use', 'graphic', 'female', 'male', 'nudity', 'bathroom', 'sex', 'oral', 'sex', 'threesome', 'are', 'totally', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'definitely', 'not', 'kid', 'friendly', 'so', 'make', 'sure', 'little', 'ones', 'are', 'asleep', 'see', 'movie']",N/A

1303409,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B002ZG97PG,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[25, 34]","Sergio (Sean Combs) is looking for the next big thing to bring in revenue for Pinnacle Records. Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) suggests that they bring Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to the Greek Theater in Los Angeles for the tenth anniversary of his last live concert there, which was the highest selling live album of all time. As a result Sergio sets up the concert and gives Aaron the task of escorting Aldous from London to Los Angeles in 72 hours. But since Aldous is off the wagon getting him there might be a little harder than Aaron imagined.The character of Aldous Snow was first conjured up by Jason Segel and brought to life by Russell Brand in the 2008 movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Not too long after the release of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, director Nick Stoller announced they would be doing a spin off movie based on Aldous Snow falling off the wagon, and that movie would star Russell Brand and Jonah Hill, albeit, in a different role than Hill played Marshall. While the idea seemed intriguing, and the character of Aldous was brilliant in Marshall, I have to admit I had some reservations about the idea of a spinoff focusing on Aldous as a main character. So how did the movie turn out?It turns out I had nothing to worry about. While the premise might sound a bit contrived at first (and the trailers don't help that feeling when you see Combs's character bring it up) the plotting feels nothing less than organic. While at times over the top, it never truly feels over the top, making the world these characters live in feel real. Part of the reason for that is the characters have been perfectly rounded out. One of the things that I was worried about, was in Sarah Marshall Snow wasn't completely fleshed out nor did he need to be, he was a blissed out rock star, and you really didn't need to know more about him for his role in the plot. For Greek writer/director Nick Stoller gives the character a soul, and Russell Brand does a great job of breathing life into that soul.Speaking of Russell Brand, he might have stolen every scene he was in during Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but here he's upstaged, not by Jonah Hill, but (dare I say it) Sean Combs. I never would have expected that I would be saying anything of the sort, but Sean Combs truly steals the movie playing a music executive who's the spiritual brother of Tom Cruise's Les Grossman from Tropic Thunder. Everyone does a great job in their roles, but it's Combs and Brand that really make the movie.Of course not everything comes up roses, the movie suffers from a nearly clich&eacute; third act that stops nearly dead in it's tracks as it gets overly serious. It's understood that in a movie where they show excessive drug use and debauchery things are eventually going to have to come to a head for the characters, at the same time this probably could have been handled in a more entertaining manner. About half way through the third act though things pick up, but it feels like a long way through the third act before they bring back the funny.Overall I highly recommend this movie, and I wouldn't be surprised if when all is said and done at year's end this remains the funniest movie of the year. If you like other movies produced by Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Superbad, Pineapple Express, Knocked Up, and most definitely Forgetting Sarah Marshall) you'll most likely, almost definitely love this movie.

And even then, sorry, it would be flash in the failed, wannabe Pied Piper/Peter Pan.To be fair, Mr. Brand does maniac with the soul of a poet/naif very well indeed.  But does this really help this film rise to any level of quality?  Not even close.Over the top, relentless pacing, broad, cliche depictions with not a shred of subtlety ---and remember,  subtlety requires a musical ear, melodic progressions, chord & key changes, riffs, bridges--can sustain a work to a discerning audience but so long, and Mr Stoller may not have the chops to get beyond that level, tho hope springs eternal.I think, as an actor, Jonah Hill (Aaron) has it in him to do just that some day, get beyond that level, and so, deserves better material.The demographic to which Mr. Stoller's stuff apparently appeals most is the most sought after,  and so, commerce impacts yet again....at least in the short term.In service of perspective, compare this film to the sine qua non of mockumentaries...and one also centering on the music industry:  Rob Reiner's This is Spinal Tap.So far, nothing has even come close... and within this perspective re quality, Get Him to the Greek would no way pass even the open call/audition phase.Then we might throw in the source of the sit on him and plunge the adrenaline needle straight into his chest scene: the brilliant Pulp Fiction.Tarantino's work is pure genius, entirely original. While nobody does over the top better--except, perhaps for the Coen Bros---Tarantino brings originality, vision, nuance and a flawless musical sense to whole new levels.There are some stand out funnies in Get Him to the Greek, i.e, the manic, unalloyed ditz/ sex robot girl Diddy orders to have sex with Jonah Hill's character...she whose pubes are shaved into the shape of a microphone.  Now, that was adorable and original.....something most of this movie is in desperate need of.All told, we end up with what is essentially a lame middle school skit (or older but wrecked on this and that) shallow, puerile satire of the music industry with a one dimensional, simplistic buddy movie at its centr.Mr. Brand's naif metamorphosing into sobriety and enlightenment  (""It feels good to feel SOMETHING"" pre school rehab) and so, transforming of/Pied Pipering others paradigm ...has no legs and so only works briefly and desultorily.Putting it all together, including a widely touted performance by Diddy essentially playing himself as a more unambiguously ruthless & despotic Music exec than on Makin The Band---tho we all enjoy self parody.....this film, with its artificial lifeforce is entirely unremarkable and often, even numbing.",2,Unremarkable in Every Way,1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,2951,"['Unremarkable', 'Every', 'WayMy', 'premise', 're', 'satire', 'parody', 'actually', 'genres', '..if', 'real', 'intelligence', 'nuance', 'are', 'absent', 'work', 'can', 'never', 'rise', 'flash', 'pan', 'so', 'should', 'be', 'panned.Or', 'case', 'Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 're', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'character', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'maybe', 'flash', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'even', 'then', 'sorry', 'would', 'be', 'flash', 'failed', 'wannabe', 'Pied', 'Piper/Peter', 'Pan.To', 'be', 'fair', 'Mr', 'Brand', 'maniac', 'soul', 'poet/naif', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'really', 'help', 'film', 'rise', 'level', 'quality', 'Not', 'even', 'close.Over', 'top', 'relentless', 'pacing', 'broad', 'cliche', 'depictions', 'not', 'shred', 'subtlety', '-and', 'remember', 'subtlety', 'musical', 'ear', 'melodic', 'progressions', 'chord', 'key', 'changes', 'riffs', 'bridges', 'can', 'sustain', 'work', 'discerning', 'audience', 'so', 'long', 'Mr', 'Stoller', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'chops', 'get', 'level', 'hope', 'springs', 'eternal.I', 'think', 'actor', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Aaron', 'do', 'just', 'day', 'get', 'level', 'so', 'better', 'material.The', 'demographic', 'Mr.', 'Stoller', 'stuff', 'apparently', 'appeals', 'most', 'most', 'sought', 'so', 'commerce', 'impacts', 'yet', 'again', 'least', 'short', 'term.In', 'service', 'perspective', 'compare', 'film', 'sine', 'qua', 'non', 'mockumentaries', 'one', 'also', 'centering', 'music', 'industry', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Spinal', 'Tap.So', 'far', 'nothing', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'perspective', 're', 'quality', 'Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 'would', 'way', 'pass', 'even', 'open', 'call/audition', 'phase.Then', 'might', 'throw', 'source', 'sit', 'plunge', 'adrenaline', 'needle', 'straight', 'chest', 'scene', 'brilliant', 'Pulp', 'Fiction.Tarantino', 'work', 'pure', 'genius', 'entirely', 'original', 'nobody', 'top', 'better', 'perhaps', 'Coen', 'Bros', '-Tarantino', 'brings', 'originality', 'vision', 'nuance', 'flawless', 'musical', 'sense', 'whole', 'new', 'levels.There', 'are', 'stand', 'out', 'funnies', 'Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 'i.e', 'manic', 'unalloyed', 'ditz/', 'sex', 'robot', 'girl', 'Diddy', 'orders', 'have', 'sex', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'character', 'pubes', 'are', 'shaved', 'shape', 'microphone', 'Now', 'was', 'adorable', 'original', '..something', 'most', 'movie', 'desperate', 'need', 'of.All', 'told', 'end', 'up', 'what', 'essentially', 'lame', 'middle', 'school', 'skit', 'older', 'wrecked', 'shallow', 'puerile', 'satire', 'music', 'industry', 'one', 'dimensional', 'simplistic', 'buddy', 'movie', 'centr.Mr', 'Brand', 'naif', 'metamorphosing', 'sobriety', 'enlightenment', 'good', 'feel', 'SOMETHING', 'pre', 'school', 'rehab', 'so', 'transforming', 'of/Pied', 'Pipering', 'others', 'paradigm', 'legs', 'so', 'only', 'briefly', 'desultorily.Putting', 'together', 'including', 'widely', 'touted', 'performance', 'Diddy', 'essentially', 'playing', 'more', 'unambiguously', 'ruthless', 'despotic', 'Music', 'exec', 'Makin', 'Band', 'enjoy', 'parody', '..this', 'film', 'artificial', 'lifeforce', 'entirely', 'unremarkable', 'often', 'even', 'numbing']",N/A

1303417,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B002ZG97PG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 5]","Get Him to the Greek is the latest Judd Apatow-produced comedy, a semi-sequel to Forgetting Sarah Marshall that allows scene-stealing rock star Aldous Snow (brilliantly played by Russell Brand) to take center stage. Get Him to the Greek is consistently funny with likeable, down-to-earth characters and though much different in tone from Forgetting Sarah Marshall it's one of the funniest comedies I've seen in 2010.Aldous Snow was a successful rock musician with seven years of sobriety under his belt last time we saw him. Now, after his new record is a disastrous flop, he retreats from the music scene and returns to a life of rock star excess. Jonah Hill (who played an obsessive fan of Snow's in FSM) plays Aaron Green, an aspiring record executive at Pinnacle Records. His boss Sergio (Sean ""Diddy"" Combs) assigns Aaron the task of escorting Aldous Snow from London to Los Angeles for a 10-year-anniversary show at the Greek Theatre within 72 hours. Obviously, hilarity then ensues...Writer/director Nicholas Stoller gives us a pretty simple setup but also incorporates elements of drama in the same way FSM did. Some of these dramatic scenes work; others feel uninspired and rushed. That aside, I would award the film five stars if not for the last thirty minutes, where the film suddenly loses steam and even sways toward the generic a bit. The threesome scene is particularly notable as being a joke that begins as amusing but quickly wears out it's welcome and is dragged on just a bit to long. The humor here will appeal to a broad spectrum of comedic tastes as it's both intelligent and immature, but the jokes come so furiously that when one brings the film down, another is there to pick it back up. I can't think of a scene from a comedy this year that is as funny as the Las Vegas/""Geoffrey"" scene in this film; the scene is an absolute riot, brilliantly scripted and performed. This film is also home to some of the year's most terrific throwaway lines (""It's Kubrickian,"" ""Randy Quaid maybe,"" etc.).As with any Apatow produced film, it's the actors that really carry the film though. Russell Brand and the character Aldous Snow obviously share many similarities, but that doesn't take away from how brilliantly well Brand portrays Snow. Humor aside, he is very convincing in the emotional scenes and when he has to perform music he does it with just the right amount of bravado. Incredibly, Brand proves to be a talented singer and it's believable that Snow could actually be a successful rock musician. The reason this film was made though and what really keeps the film moving is the chemistry between Brand and Jonah Hill. Both have a very different comedic styles (Brand being more flamboyant, Hill being more deadpan), but they complement each other perfectly and it's a joy seeing them share the screen together again. Main stars aside, the film's rock star/celebrity cameos and Apatow regulars turning up in bit parts also work very well. Lars Ulrich has a surprisingly amusing cameo that doesn't feel forced and out of place and the appearance of Tom Felton of ""Harry Potter"" fame is not wasted.While it is Brand and Hill's film much of their thunder is stolen by a rather surprising contender in the form of Mr. Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. From the first moment he appears onscreen, Combs completely steals the show from everyone. It's hard to imagine that the artist formerly known as Puff Daddy could make such an impression, but playing an eccentric record executive seems to have put Combs in his element as his character has some of the most memorable, hilarious lines. It's no exaggeration that Combs puts everyone else he shares a scene with to shame. It's a terrific performance that will have you clutching your stomach with laughter at times.Get Him to the Greek is not a perfect film nor is it a perfect comedy, but much of it is brilliant. It is one of the most pleasing and enjoyable comedies of the year. I would welcome a sequel to the film and, while it lacks the depth of FSM, it's arguably just as funny.The double-disc edition of the DVD is definitely worth purchasing. As usual, it contains both the rated and unrated versions of the film and the bonus features aren't anything ""new,"" but they are insightful and hilarious. There are three, fairly extensive behind-the-scenes documentaries talking about the film and the music that drives the film. Of course, there's also gag reels, deleted scenes, alternate endings, etc. I typically ignore these features on a DVD, but these features are really funny and worth watching.MOVIE: BDVD: A-",4,One of the Most Enjoyable Comedies of 2010 (Great DVD too!),1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,4578,"['Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 'latest', 'Judd', 'Apatow-produced', 'comedy', 'semi-sequel', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'scene-stealing', 'rock', 'star', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 'consistently', 'funny', 'likeable', 'down-to-earth', 'characters', 'though', 'much', 'different', 'tone', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'one', 'funniest', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2010.Aldous', 'Snow', 'was', 'successful', 'rock', 'musician', 'seven', 'years', 'sobriety', 'belt', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'Now', 'new', 'record', 'disastrous', 'flop', 'music', 'scene', 'returns', 'life', 'rock', 'star', 'excess', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'who', 'played', 'obsessive', 'fan', 'Snow', 'FSM', 'Aaron', 'Green', 'aspiring', 'record', 'executive', 'Pinnacle', 'Records', 'boss', 'Sergio', 'Sean', 'Diddy', 'Combs', 'Aaron', 'task', 'escorting', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'London', 'Los', 'Angeles', '10-year-anniversary', 'show', 'Greek', 'Theatre', '72', 'hours', 'Obviously', 'hilarity', 'then', 'Writer/director', 'Nicholas', 'Stoller', 'pretty', 'simple', 'setup', 'also', 'elements', 'drama', 'same', 'way', 'FSM', 'did', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'work', 'others', 'feel', 'uninspired', 'rushed', 'aside', 'would', 'award', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'not', 'last', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'where', 'film', 'suddenly', 'steam', 'even', 'sways', 'generic', 'bit', 'threesome', 'scene', 'particularly', 'notable', 'being', 'joke', 'amusing', 'quickly', 'welcome', 'dragged', 'just', 'bit', 'long', 'humor', 'here', 'will', 'appeal', 'broad', 'spectrum', 'comedic', 'tastes', 'intelligent', 'immature', 'jokes', 'come', 'so', 'furiously', 'when', 'one', 'film', 'down', 'there', 'pick', 'back', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'scene', 'comedy', 'year', 'as', 'funny', 'Las', 'Vegas/', 'Geoffrey', 'scene', 'film', 'scene', 'absolute', 'riot', 'brilliantly', 'scripted', 'performed', 'film', 'also', 'home', 'year', 'most', 'terrific', 'throwaway', 'lines', 'Kubrickian', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'maybe', 'etc', '.As', 'Apatow', 'produced', 'film', 'actors', 'really', 'carry', 'film', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'character', 'Aldous', 'Snow', 'obviously', 'share', 'many', 'similarities', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'how', 'brilliantly', 'well', 'Brand', 'portrays', 'Snow', 'Humor', 'aside', 'very', 'convincing', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'when', 'perform', 'music', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'bravado', 'Incredibly', 'Brand', 'be', 'talented', 'singer', 'believable', 'Snow', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'successful', 'rock', 'musician', 'reason', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'moving', 'chemistry', 'Brand', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'comedic', 'styles', 'Brand', 'being', 'more', 'flamboyant', 'Hill', 'being', 'more', 'deadpan', 'complement', 'other', 'perfectly', 'joy', 'seeing', 'share', 'screen', 'together', 'again', 'Main', 'stars', 'aside', 'film', 'rock', 'star/celebrity', 'cameos', 'Apatow', 'regulars', 'turning', 'up', 'bit', 'parts', 'also', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'Lars', 'Ulrich', 'surprisingly', 'amusing', 'cameo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'forced', 'place', 'appearance', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fame', 'not', 'wasted.While', 'Brand', 'Hill', 'film', 'much', 'thunder', 'stolen', 'rather', 'surprising', 'contender', 'form', 'Mr.', 'Sean', 'Diddy', 'Combs', 'first', 'moment', 'onscreen', 'Combs', 'completely', 'show', 'everyone', 'hard', 'imagine', 'artist', 'formerly', 'known', 'Puff', 'Daddy', 'could', 'make', 'such', 'impression', 'playing', 'eccentric', 'record', 'executive', 'have', 'put', 'Combs', 'element', 'character', 'most', 'memorable', 'hilarious', 'lines', 'exaggeration', 'Combs', 'everyone', 'else', 'shares', 'scene', 'shame', 'terrific', 'performance', 'will', 'have', 'clutching', 'stomach', 'laughter', 'times.Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'much', 'brilliant', 'one', 'most', 'pleasing', 'enjoyable', 'comedies', 'year', 'would', 'welcome', 'sequel', 'film', 'depth', 'FSM', 'arguably', 'just', 'funny.The', 'double-disc', 'edition', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'usual', 'rated', 'unrated', 'versions', 'film', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'are', 'insightful', 'hilarious', 'are', 'three', 'fairly', 'extensive', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentaries', 'talking', 'film', 'music', 'film', 'course', 'also', 'gag', 'reels', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'endings', 'etc', 'typically', 'ignore', 'features', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'worth', 'watching.MOVIE', 'BDVD', 'A-']",N/A

It's a film about a rum-soaked, drug-addled falling down rock star (no, NOT Lindsay Lohan!), Aldous Snow (Russell Brand fromForgetting Sarah Marshall), and how Sean No-Longer Puff Daddy Combs, his record producer, attempts to get him from London to The Greek Theatre for his comeback concert under the wide-eyed innocent shepherding of Jonah Hill.The results are predictable, but very funny. Brand's character has fallen off the wagon and under the rear axle, so this 72 hour trip is a literal trip through a world of sexually desperate groupies, controlled illicit hallucinogenic substances, and booze by the bucketload. Jonah Hill's character, Aaron, the innocent patsy, is subjected to the full range of epicurean delights delivered up to any rock star. He's so out of his element that his very presence evokes laughter.By far the best sequence concerns ""The Jeffrey"" a supercharged smoking mixture. The chaos which ensues when The Jeffrey gets passed around had me laughing so hard my sides hurt. I've got to hand it to the director. The movie could have gone badly off the rails at this point, but the chaos is so deftly handled that it never jumps the tracks, even though it SEEMS to.

1303424,A356RFKNIG043B,B002ZG97PG,K. Swanson,"[3, 3]","I loved Brand in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but Segel's script for that looks like Shakespeare compared to some of this. RB was allowed to improv heavily in FSM and it injected real energy into his scenes. Here he's either working mostly from the flaccid script, or just couldn't reach his previous heights. Perhaps now that he's a real star, as opposed to on the cusp as in FSM, his brio is gone-o.Hill is good here, but at this rate he's going to have to change his name to Jonah Mountain. It's kind of painful to watch someone eat himself into morbidly obese territory, film by film, especially as he can be quite funny at times. John Candy and Chris Farley showed where that road leads; must we see their story yet again? It would be nice to watch Hill for another 20 years, not 2. His weight makes his role here even more unbelievable; if you know the super-phony worlds of the music biz and L.A., you know that very few guys looking like him ever get past Assistant to the VP of Nothing status.On that note, however, Puffy delivers the best performance in the film. He's truly funny at times and gave me most of the best laughs here. The guy's got real comic presence. More, please! (But why does a multi-millionaire with six kids have a 16-cubic-foot fridge?)Brand does have his moments, but all in all I felt let down. Then again, his stand-up dvd isn't that funny, though his autobiography does have moments of genius. Who knows? Maybe he peaked with FSM and it's all downhill from there. The rock-star cliches can only be milked for so long, and then one must actually deliver some depth. Brand has the intellect to do it; let's hope his next vehicle shows more humor than this.There's a LOT of drug usage here, so if that offends you, better avoid this. I don't mind drug humor, or any humor for that matter...if it's funny. Here, it falls mostly flat. Outrageousness is a laugh for a while, then actual content is needed---as RB is learning.I laughed out loud maybe six times during Greek, which is ok, but nothing compared to what I expected from the Aldous Snow we saw in FSM. If you love Hill or Brand, you'll enjoy this, but don't feel bad if you give it a pass. It's one of the weakest things to come out of the Apatow Factory, and you'd be better off and get more laughs from watching The 40-Year-Old Virgin again.PS I watched the rental dvd, and had to laugh that the menu included gag reel, etc (which might better than the movie, not a real stretch), but when you click on them you get a message saying, ""Buy the dvd to get all these extras we put up on the menu to remind you what greedy Hollywood weasels we are!"" Well, no thanks, and good luck getting any sympathy for your incessant warnings and whinings about piracy.

1303429,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B002ZG97PG,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[3, 6]","About two years ago, Forgetting Sarah Marshall introduced Russell Brand who played her British rock star boyfriend Aldous Snow. In that movie he managed to steal every scene, and really had the rock star persona down.  Not only that, it turns out that he is an excellent standup comedian, and an author,My Booky Wook: A Memoir of Sex, Drugs, and Stand-Upalthough his book about his addiction fueled adventures while witty and intelligent, is not for the faint hearted, yet mirrors somewhat the journey he takes here.When I was over in England some time ago, I learned that he got into some major trouble for a telephone prank call he did on a radio show with Jonathan Ross.  It just went way too far, and Ross got suspended for several months from his tv talk show.. But I digress.It's no surpise that director Judd Apatow has now released this movie, featuring some of the same characters.Jonah Hill, the guy who looks like Seth Rogen but isn't, plays our hapless protagonist working at the record company, and his boss is Sergio (played brilliantly by Sean Combs). He has the girlfriend who works nights so she's coming as he's going, and she wants to move to Seattle from LA, end of discussion.  The argument that ensues is classic.He has the great idea to do a concert for Aldous Snow at the Greek, and so gets sent on a mission to get Aldous Snow to the Greek.As you go deeper into the movie, you get swept away by the series of mishaps as Aaron attempts to keep his sanity while being dragged into the insanity that has become the rock star's life, and many great comic moments ensue.I went to see this movie because of Russell Brand, and I enjoyed it mostly because of Jonah Hill, who I feel has developed tremendously as an actor.

I am too old to be its target demographic, but I think it is a brilliant movie, and Russell Brand and his character were a huge factor in making it so.  Thus, I had very high expectations for this movie, and went to see it in theater the day it opened.  Four observations that hold up after four viewings (DVD the other 3), which is why I gave it four stars when it really deserves only 3.5:1.  The attempted threesome with Aaron is offputting to watch, and feels inserted just to be outrageous, like a 2-second shot of a topless girl in a teen comedy to ensure it's rated R. On DVD, I fast forward right past it.  Much better.2.  The music is a hilarious send up, and most of it is actually really GOOD.  ""The Clap"" is still in my running mix.3.  Sean Combs is the funniest guy in the movie, for better AND worse.4.  Brand, though a comedian by trade, is really not very funny--but here comes the weird good part:  he is marvelous in capturing the sadness, the loneliness, and ultimately, the fulfillment that comes with his job and his life.  So, though I found this a mediocre comedy, it was an excellent movie thanks to very good acting by Brand.Bottom line:  In the universe of these movies, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Superbad are at the peak, then 40 Year Old Virgin, Get Him to the Greek as drama, Knocked Up, I Love You Man, Get Him to the Greek as comedy, and down at the bottom, This is 40, which is neither a comedy nor a drama--it's just a payday for the people involved, and a rip off even at $2.99.

Then as you older, find out the easy way (that is, by reading the news and such) that it's not such a glamourous life after all? Well, unfortunately, Aaron Green, a Record Company assistant who is a big fan of Alodus ""Infant Sorrow"" Snow, has to find it out the hard way... that is, actually work for him. And so begins the hilarious spinoff of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"".Aaron Green is working for a dying record company. His manager Sergio, played in a hilarious performance from P. Diddy, needs ideas quick. However, Aaron comes up with one quick idea: the 10th anniversary of Infant Sorrow's legendary show at the Greek in Los Angeles is coming up, and the perfect way to celebrate is to have an anniversary concert at the exact venue. Sergio approves of the deal, so he is given three days to fly to London, get Alodus Snow to New York City for an interview and performance on ""The Today Show"", then back to Los Angeles for the concert. So it sounds simple, right?Actually, wrong. The moment Green meets Snow in London, a nightmare begins. Snow is a drugged out and alcoholic man who lives with his mom after his breakup with female pop sensation Jackie Q and the flop (and mass criticism of his apparently horrible record ""African Child"", oft regarded ""The worst thing to happen to Africa since Apartheid"". Crazy parties including absinthe consumption, ugly sex, and unexpected detours begin. Just pray to god that they'll get to Los Angeles on time, okay?Now enough of the babbling about the plot, let's get to the bottom of it. Personally, I enjoyed the movie. I mean, I knew what it was gonna be- a rude and crude comedy from Apatow. His movies are often that, and this is no different. The movie has excellent performances from Russell Brand and P. Diddy, and especially a different direction for Jona Hill. There's plenty of gags and laughs, plenty of grossout moments and WTF scenes.However, there's something missing from the movie I can't seem to find. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's because of the fact that some scenes, including the ""Jeffery"" scene, go on for too long, and as a result, beat the audience to death with the joke because they feel that the audience isn't laughing, its almost Stoller's way of saying ""laugh, dammit, laugh!"". Also, I found some scenes to be a bit too dark (granted I love dark things). About 10 minutes before the concert, some scenes are just downright depressing. Not to mention the heroin scene at the Vegas hotel. Also, the movie is a tad too long, and at least 10 minutes could have been removed.In short, it's good laugh fare if you just want a nice little comedy with crude jokes and Brand, but just don't expect too much. I personally find Forgetting Sarah Marshall to be a lot better.",3,"Very funny and enjoyable, but it's missing something I can't quite comprehend",1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,2871,"['Do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'days', 'when', ""'d"", 'hear', 'favorite', 'singer', 'radio', 'would', 'think', 'want', 'work', 'Then', 'older', 'find', 'out', 'easy', 'way', 'reading', 'news', 'such', 'not', 'such', 'glamourous', 'life', 'Well', 'unfortunately', 'Aaron', 'Green', 'Record', 'Company', 'assistant', 'who', 'big', 'fan', 'Alodus', 'Infant', 'Sorrow', 'Snow', 'find', 'out', 'hard', 'way', 'actually', 'work', 'so', 'hilarious', 'spinoff', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', '.Aaron', 'Green', 'working', 'dying', 'record', 'company', 'manager', 'Sergio', 'played', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'P.', 'Diddy', 'ideas', 'quick', 'However', 'Aaron', 'up', 'one', 'quick', 'idea', '10th', 'anniversary', 'Infant', 'Sorrow', 'legendary', 'show', 'Greek', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'coming', 'up', 'perfect', 'way', 'celebrate', 'have', 'anniversary', 'concert', 'exact', 'venue', 'Sergio', 'deal', 'given', 'three', 'days', 'fly', 'London', 'get', 'Alodus', 'Snow', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'interview', 'performance', 'Today', 'Show', 'then', 'back', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'concert', 'simple', 'right', 'Actually', 'wrong', 'moment', 'Green', 'meets', 'Snow', 'London', 'nightmare', 'Snow', 'drugged', 'out', 'alcoholic', 'man', 'who', 'mom', 'breakup', 'female', 'pop', 'sensation', 'Jackie', 'Q', 'flop', 'mass', 'criticism', 'apparently', 'horrible', 'record', 'African', 'Child', 'oft', 'regarded', 'worst', 'thing', 'happen', 'Africa', 'Apartheid', 'Crazy', 'parties', 'including', 'absinthe', 'consumption', 'ugly', 'sex', 'unexpected', 'detours', 'begin', 'Just', 'pray', 'god', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'time', 'okay', 'Now', 'enough', 'babbling', 'plot', 'let', 'get', 'bottom', 'Personally', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'mean', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'gon', 'be-', 'rude', 'crude', 'comedy', 'Apatow', 'movies', 'are', 'often', 'different', 'movie', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'P.', 'Diddy', 'especially', 'different', 'direction', 'Jona', 'Hill', 'plenty', 'gags', 'laughs', 'plenty', 'grossout', 'moments', 'WTF', 'scenes.However', 'something', 'missing', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Maybe', 'fact', 'scenes', 'including', 'Jeffery', 'scene', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'result', 'beat', 'audience', 'death', 'joke', 'feel', 'audience', ""n't"", 'laughing', 'almost', 'Stoller', 'way', 'saying', 'laugh', 'dammit', 'laugh', 'Also', 'found', 'scenes', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'dark', 'granted', 'love', 'dark', 'things', '10', 'minutes', 'concert', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'downright', 'depressing', 'Not', 'mention', 'heroin', 'scene', 'Vegas', 'hotel', 'Also', 'movie', 'tad', 'too', 'long', 'least', '10', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'removed.In', 'short', 'good', 'laugh', 'fare', 'just', 'want', 'nice', 'little', 'comedy', 'crude', 'jokes', 'Brand', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'personally', 'find', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'be', 'lot', 'better']",N/A

He's come up with this idea when Pinnacle Records, his employer, is trying to generate fabulous new ideas to bring in lots and lots of money.The film is screamingly funny in parts.  The humor tends to be on the very gross side, with frequent references to drugs, sex, and, well, rock-n-roll.  There is heroin, weed, cocaine, and a drug called jeffrey.  This last is a made-up concoction of heroin, angel dust, marijuana, methadone, meth, and goodness knows what else.Jonah Hill plays Aaron Green, who views this as a major accomplishment, especially important to him because his girlfriend Daphne Binks is a resident who wants to move to Seattle to further her medical career.  Green's not happy at the idea of giving up his dream of a successful career that could ironically bring in a lot more money than a doctor could.The last major piece in the puzzle is Aldous Snow (Russel Brand) who is a man-child who is used to getting his own way.  His last album was a clunker, and he's split from his wife Jackie Q (Rose Byrne), whom he slowly discovers he has not gotten over.Although Green has been charged with the simple task of shepherding Snow from London to LA, it turns out much more difficult than he imagined.  He grows as a man, realizing that he wants things out of his relationship that his girlfriend isn't ready to give (like taking into account where he wants to live).The film is good and pretty funny, but somewhat predictable and definitely gross.  There is much nudity, and gross scenes that richly earn the film an 'R' rating.Three-and-a-half stars for 'Get Him to the Greek'.  If the viewer isn't grossed out by frequent references to various bodily functions, it might be raised to four stars.

1303469,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B002ZG97PG,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[2, 3]","Get Him To The Greek continues the story of Aldous Snow who we first met in the 2008 comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Snow is once again played by the energetic and charismatic Russell Brand who essentially plays himself. This very much the same character that was featured in Forgetting Sarah Marshall only he's not sober this time around. I loved the character and though Russell Brand delivered a great performance so it's no surprise I wanted to see Get Him To The Greek, a continuation of the character but not a sequel. I can't imagine anyone more fitted for this role than Brand, this role was tailor-made for him. Jonas Hill who played another character in the same movie is back this time around but he plays a different character in that of Aaron, a likeable guy who's a passionate music fan. Also worth mentioning is Elisabeth Moss as Daphnee, Aaron's longtime girlfriend who is of importance here. Sean Combs a.k.a P.Diddy makes an appearance as Record executive Sergio and proves he can act; his scenes are highlights of the film.The movie begins by introducing rockstar Aldous Snow who is an internationally famous frontman from the band Infant Sorrow. Snow's career is on the decline following the release of his latest album ""African Child"". Aldous' wife, popstar Jackie Q leaves him and he starts to drink again after being sober for 7 years and he ends up on the cover of many tabloid magazines covering his fall from superstardom . A concert at the Greek Theatre (where the movie gets its title) is arranged for Aldous and could set him back on the right path. The Greek was were Aldous recorded the best selling live album of all time (that's fictional of course). Record company employee Aaron gets his big break as is chosen to escort Aldous Snow to the concert in 72 hours and is in charge of making sure Snow gets there on time, does the soundcheck etc. Aaron gets to experience the rockstar life many of us fantasize about which often leads to over the top and hilarious situations. Of course managing a world famous rockstar on the decline for 72 hours isn't the easiest thing there is so there are lots of fun and interesting twists that make Get Him To The Greek not a perfect, but a rather very enjoyable comedy.Get Him To The Greek is a good look at the music industry even if there are instances where it pokes fun at it. In an early scene there is even a Record company meeting with the boss and his employees who basically tells them that nobody buys CDs anymore. It shows some of the over the top and Spinal Tap aspects of the music business which manages to be both and entertaining. You get a certain sense that Get Him To The Greek pokes fun at rockstars and the music industry but there is also a part that celebrates music and portrays just how musicians are glorified for what they do.The songs performed by Infant Sorrow for the soundtrack of the film (of which there are a few: ""The Clap"", ""Going Up"" and ""Furry Walls"" for instance which are performed in the movie) are excellent and fit the movie very well as well as being good fun songs. Music being an integral part of the movie I just thought I'd add that the Infant Sorrow and Jackie Q songs are fun and have their place here just like the other artists featured.Brand and Hill are a winning combination, they make a good team together and are fun to watch interact. There are many drugs references and use, alcohol abuse and some sexual content just so you know so this may not be for the younger ones. Get Him To The Greek is not an amazing 5 stars movie but for the fun and entertainment it provided, in my opinion based on how much I enjoyed it, to me at least it's worth a 4. It helps if you're a music fan but doesn't matter if you aren't. I personally really liked it because it had much to do with music. It's a brilliant look at music superstardom and it doesn't take itself too seriously, almost like a modern version of Spinal Tap.

The rules have changed for sequels, because Get Him to the Greek is a movie that needed to be made regardless of Sarah Marshall.  This film is hilarious, insane, dark, dirty, and at times touching.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Stoller's previous film, but this one is so good that it seems unrelated to Jason Segel's romantic comedy.  That is what a spinoff should be.  It can be born out of a preexisting film, but it must be a unique engine altogether.  Get Him to the Greek succeeded as a stand-alone film, as well as being the number one laugh-giver of 2010.  The mixture of british humor and Apatow-esque improv is balanced perfectly, and Nicholas Stoller's directing style is finally established in this quick, yet visceral comedy.  Russell Brand and Jonah Hill wield a chemistry that makes buddy comedies look like soap operas.  I laughed constantly, and my viewing experience never slowed or dulled.  In a world where we are so easily distracted from boring dialogue scenes, GHTTG masters comedic pacing remarkably.I'm actually just plain proud that this movie is that good.  Its brilliant in fact.  It works, because even though it is disgustingly funny, it touches on something truly dark and important about rock stars.  It tries to make a point, while making your diaphragm rattle.  It's good news to hear that even though Apatow suffered some losses like Year One and Funny People, Get Him to the Greek declares that the company still holds the reign in comedy.",5,Funniest Movie of 2010,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,1588,"['spinoff', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Was', 'film', 'good', 'enough', 'warrant', 'sequel', 'let', 'alone', 'spinoff', 'rules', 'have', 'changed', 'sequels', 'Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 'movie', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'regardless', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'film', 'hilarious', 'insane', 'dark', 'dirty', 'times', 'touching', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'have', 'nothing', 'Stoller', 'previous', 'film', 'one', 'so', 'good', 'unrelated', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'what', 'spinoff', 'should', 'be', 'can', 'be', 'born', 'preexisting', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'unique', 'engine', 'altogether', 'Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 'succeeded', 'stand-alone', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'number', 'one', 'laugh-giver', '2010', 'mixture', 'british', 'humor', 'Apatow-esque', 'improv', 'balanced', 'perfectly', 'Nicholas', 'Stoller', 'directing', 'style', 'finally', 'established', 'quick', 'yet', 'visceral', 'comedy', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'wield', 'chemistry', 'buddy', 'comedies', 'look', 'soap', 'operas', 'laughed', 'constantly', 'viewing', 'experience', 'never', 'slowed', 'dulled', 'world', 'where', 'are', 'so', 'easily', 'distracted', 'boring', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'GHTTG', 'masters', 'comedic', 'pacing', 'remarkably.I', ""'m"", 'actually', 'just', 'plain', 'proud', 'movie', 'good', 'brilliant', 'fact', 'even', 'disgustingly', 'funny', 'something', 'truly', 'dark', 'important', 'rock', 'stars', 'make', 'point', 'making', 'diaphragm', 'rattle', 'good', 'news', 'hear', 'even', 'Apatow', 'suffered', 'losses', 'Year', 'One', 'Funny', 'People', 'Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 'declares', 'company', 'still', 'reign', 'comedy']",N/A
