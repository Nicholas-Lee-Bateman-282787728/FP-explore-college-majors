1423779,A3VLIYQG8I0S2K,B004PR0JA0,J. boyle,"[6, 6]","Bearcats! was the type of fun adventure series they don't make anymore.Two trouble shooters for hire take the jobs that can't be done by anyone else.Their fee? A blank check, filled out after the job depending on how hard and dangerous the mission was.The title comes from their car, a brand new Stutz Bearcat, the most popular American sports car of the day.While more dramatic and realistic than the later (and silly) ""The A-Team"", it's more like a latter-day ""Have Gun - Will Travel"".Rod Taylor manages to inject a lot of humor unto his role of Hank Brackett, a tough Army veteran. He's helped by the younger Johnny Reach (Dennis Cole) who was raised by the Apaches after his parents died.They use their brains to outwit the bad guys who range from German spies (It's set in the immediate Pre-WWI period), to a bank robber who is using a stolen tank to (literally) knock over banks, to terrorists.Nice location filming, super guest stars, a neat car, what more could young boys of 1971 ask for?Some of the parts seem a bit dated now...some of the background music is a bit dated and a couple of the scripts lack some logic, but that's not really the point.Pop in the DVD ahd have fun. It's a great alternative to today's TV diet of reality and crime shows.",4,A fun series,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,1259,"['Bearcats', 'was', 'type', 'fun', 'adventure', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore.Two', 'trouble', 'shooters', 'hire', 'take', 'jobs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'anyone', 'else.Their', 'fee', 'blank', 'check', 'filled', 'out', 'job', 'depending', 'how', 'hard', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'was.The', 'title', 'car', 'brand', 'new', 'Stutz', 'Bearcat', 'most', 'popular', 'American', 'sports', 'car', 'day.While', 'more', 'dramatic', 'realistic', 'later', 'silly', 'A-Team', 'more', 'latter-day', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', '.Rod', 'Taylor', 'inject', 'lot', 'humor', 'role', 'Hank', 'Brackett', 'tough', 'Army', 'veteran', 'helped', 'younger', 'Johnny', 'Reach', 'Dennis', 'Cole', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'Apaches', 'parents', 'died.They', 'use', 'brains', 'outwit', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'range', 'German', 'spies', 'set', 'immediate', 'Pre-WWI', 'period', 'bank', 'robber', 'who', 'using', 'stolen', 'tank', 'literally', 'knock', 'banks', 'terrorists.Nice', 'location', 'filming', 'super', 'guest', 'stars', 'neat', 'car', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'young', 'boys', '1971', 'ask', 'parts', 'seem', 'bit', 'dated', 'now', 'background', 'music', 'bit', 'dated', 'couple', 'scripts', 'lack', 'logic', 'not', 'really', 'point.Pop', 'DVD', 'ahd', 'have', 'fun', 'great', 'alternative', 'today', 'TV', 'diet', 'reality', 'crime', 'shows']",N/A

Not many people saw this and seeing it now reminds me of the ""good"" old days of TV where things were fun and clean.  Now as I watch  this I can see that it was a Mission Impossible done in the style of turn of the 20th century when the wild west was dying and modern weapons were just appearing.Bearcats followed the same structure as IMF with an impossilbe problem, the planning, the set up, and the follow through of the plan.  Throw in a little banner, some girls, guns and cars and you had your Bearcat espisode for the week.Rod Taylor never had any luck with TV.  He had two other series that were quite good, Masquerade and Outlaws.  The last one was very good and very original, but TV being what it is, being good and original was not enough.If you can forget about the video quaility then you will have a great time.
