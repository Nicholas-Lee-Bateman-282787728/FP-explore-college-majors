He's smart, he's a terrific orator, and he knows how to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. In fact, the members of his congregation are entirely too comfortable, willing to accept Jim Crow laws and injustices of all kinds.He does his best to stir them to care about their own rights and self-respect, but to little avail. The one member who becomes convinced, a deacon who is also the local football coach, is the only holdout when the board of deacons wants to get rid of Dr. Johns. When he is killed by a policeman for interfering in their beating of a young black man, the board had a unanimous vote.They decided they needed a new preacher, at least as intelligent, but more dignified and conventional than Dr. Johns.

361183,A3QVGCQL9D5KIH,6303160093,"Missouri Eagle ""Van""","[1, 1]","The Vernon Johns Story is one that should be shown to all Americans.  Vernon Johns (James Earl Jones) is a pastor who traveled to churches in the south, preaching until 1948 when he was hired by Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery Alabama.  As near as I can tell, the movie remains historical fiction in that details, specific people and events may have been added, but the story itself and the message as well as the general plot are historically accurate.  The racial prejudices come clear in the movie, and they are as I remember them in the late 50's and 60's.  The movie deals very will and carefully with the characters, emotions, and 'both' sides of the racial issues.  People are as they are, as they've been 'raised/socialized' whether Black, white, indian, asian etc.  All the characters portrayed in the movie are carefully developed and the supporting cast each performed admirably.  This is one of those movies that pull you into the story, make you think, see the injustice, wrongs, and social atmosphere.  The movie isn't preachy or 'pushing' one side or the other and that's one reason I love to watch it over and over again.  It makes the viewer want to 'do something' to correct a wrong, or fight a fight.  Vernon Johns (in the movie and in real life) began the Civil Rights movement.  He is unheralded for the most part because he was replaced as pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church by a very young new pastor named Dr. Martin Luther King,Jr. by the Black 'Elders/Deacons' of the Church (the same ones who hired him) because of the 'waves' he made trying to equalize the racism so prevalent at the time.  The Vernon Johns Story should be required reading/viewing in ALL schools across the U.S.  We've made huge strides in creating 'equality' across races in the U.S. but some racism and certainly other social issues still exist that need to be addressed.  This movie is one of my favorite movies and it's definitely worth buying to be able to view again and again.",5,If you see a good fight get in it.,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,1998,"['Vernon', 'Johns', 'Story', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'Americans', 'Vernon', 'Johns', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'pastor', 'who', 'traveled', 'churches', 'south', 'preaching', '1948', 'when', 'was', 'hired', 'Dexter', 'Avenue', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'Montgomery', 'Alabama', 'As', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'historical', 'fiction', 'details', 'specific', 'people', 'events', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'story', 'message', 'as', 'well', 'general', 'plot', 'are', 'historically', 'accurate', 'racial', 'prejudices', 'come', 'clear', 'movie', 'are', 'remember', 'late', '50', '60', 'movie', 'very', 'will', 'carefully', 'characters', 'emotions', ""'both"", 'sides', 'racial', 'issues', 'People', 'are', 'are', ""'ve"", 'been', ""'raised/socialized"", 'Black', 'white', 'indian', 'asian', 'etc', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'are', 'carefully', 'developed', 'supporting', 'cast', 'performed', 'admirably', 'one', 'movies', 'pull', 'story', 'make', 'think', 'see', 'injustice', 'wrongs', 'social', 'atmosphere', 'movie', ""n't"", 'preachy', ""'pushing"", 'one', 'side', 'other', 'one', 'reason', 'love', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'viewer', 'want', ""'do"", 'something', 'correct', 'wrong', 'fight', 'fight', 'Vernon', 'Johns', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'began', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'unheralded', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'replaced', 'pastor', 'Dexter', 'Avenue', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'very', 'young', 'new', 'pastor', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr', 'Black', ""'Elders/Deacons"", 'Church', 'same', 'ones', 'who', 'hired', ""'waves"", 'made', 'trying', 'equalize', 'racism', 'so', 'prevalent', 'time', 'Vernon', 'Johns', 'Story', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'reading/viewing', 'ALL', 'schools', 'U.S.', ""'ve"", 'made', 'huge', 'strides', 'creating', ""'equality"", 'races', 'U.S.', 'racism', 'certainly', 'other', 'social', 'issues', 'still', 'exist', 'need', 'be', 'addressed', 'movie', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buying', 'be', 'able', 'view', 'again', 'again']",The Road To Freedom - The Vernon Johns Story VHS
