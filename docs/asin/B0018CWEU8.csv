It's more of a comedy with a light-hearted look at what it would be like to be a wizard with real magical powers living in our non-magical world. The middle child, Alex, is always looking for ways to use her magic to speed things up or take the easy way out, but just like Raven--who tried to make her visions come true instead of just letting them play out, she finds herself in a heap of trouble that needs straightening out. And just like Raven, it's her brother coming to the rescue. Well, most of the time.",4,Light-hearted look at Wizardry,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,612,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'So', 'Raven', 'Only', 'not', 'lot', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'mystery', 'going', 'more', 'comedy', 'light-hearted', 'look', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'wizard', 'real', 'magical', 'powers', 'living', 'non-magical', 'world', 'middle', 'child', 'Alex', 'always', 'looking', 'ways', 'use', 'magic', 'speed', 'things', 'up', 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'just', 'Raven', 'who', 'tried', 'make', 'visions', 'come', 'true', 'instead', 'just', 'letting', 'play', 'out', 'heap', 'trouble', 'straightening', 'out', 'just', 'Raven', 'brother', 'coming', 'rescue', 'Well', 'most', 'time']",Wizards of Waverly Place: Wizard School

I new the show existed, but I never tried watching because I don't care today's kids series. After watching a few minutes I was hooked.The episodes on the DVD are:Wizard School Part 1Wizard School Part 2Curb Your DragonDisenchanted EveningThe problem I have with Disney releasing the series to DVD is that they never release full seasons. Typically, they release four to five episodes on DVD at a low price, which can make a great birthday or Christmas gift.Is it just me, or does the wizard school's outfits look a lot like the ones worn in Harry Potter?",5,"Great Series, but Disney Needs to Release More Episodes to DVD",1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,659,"['happened', 'be', 'flipping', 'channels', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'came', 'Wizards', 'Waverly', 'Place', 'new', 'show', 'existed', 'never', 'tried', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'today', 'kids', 'series', 'watching', 'few', 'minutes', 'was', 'hooked.The', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', 'Wizard', 'School', 'Part', '1Wizard', 'School', 'Part', '2Curb', 'Your', 'DragonDisenchanted', 'EveningThe', 'problem', 'have', 'Disney', 'releasing', 'series', 'DVD', 'never', 'release', 'full', 'seasons', 'Typically', 'release', 'four', 'five', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'low', 'price', 'can', 'make', 'great', 'birthday', 'Christmas', 'gift.Is', 'just', 'wizard', 'school', 'outfits', 'look', 'lot', 'ones', 'worn', 'Harry', 'Potter']",Wizards of Waverly Place: Wizard School

Selena Gomez and her brother played by David Henrie share a love/hate relationship, and they do it so well!  Selena Gomez is both a great actress and singer, who is going to go far in her acting career.  She delivers her lines with believable authority.  She is so cute!  This is something well worth purchasing, albeit it is only four episodes.-Damon Medic",5,Damon Medic's review.,1240185600,"04 20, 2009",2009,441,"['Wizards', 'Waverly', 'Place', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'show', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'brother', 'played', 'David', 'Henrie', 'share', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'great', 'actress', 'singer', 'who', 'going', 'go', 'far', 'acting', 'career', 'lines', 'believable', 'authority', 'so', 'cute', 'something', 'well', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'only', 'four', 'episodes.-Damon', 'Medic']",Wizards of Waverly Place: Wizard School
1159665,A21Z2EC8Y2GO65,B0018CWEU8,D. Johnson,"[37, 41]",I got this for my teenage sister. Wizards of Waverly Place is her favorite show and Selena Gomez is her idol. The thing I don't like is that you only get four episodes. It'd be better if Disney released full seasons of their shows rather than banking on $15 for just four episodes. They finally released Hannah Montana full seasons after releasing many 4 episode discs over the past couple years.,3,Not enough episodes...,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,396,"['got', 'teenage', 'sister', 'Wizards', 'Waverly', 'Place', 'favorite', 'show', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'idol', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'only', 'get', 'four', 'episodes', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'Disney', 'released', 'full', 'seasons', 'shows', 'rather', 'banking', '15', 'just', 'four', 'episodes', 'finally', 'released', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'full', 'seasons', 'releasing', 'many', '4', 'episode', 'discs', 'past', 'couple', 'years']",Wizards of Waverly Place: Wizard School
1159666,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0018CWEU8,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","Obviously, this movie builds upon the TV show. It's sure to please fans of the show. It's cute, well done, and has some funny moments. However, on its own it's not the most exciting movie. The movie doesn't introduce or develop the characters because it relies on the TV show, so if you've never watched it you might find it hard to get into the movie. Selena Gomez as the witch just comes off as annoying - imagine a teenager empowered with magic - and her acting isn't particularly good. Still the supporting characters are fun, especially Max's wisecracks.
