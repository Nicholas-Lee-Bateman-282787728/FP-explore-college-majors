And like The Wonder Years and WKRP in Cincinnati series, the dialogue is butchered and fragmented because of omitted music. The studio's excuse is always the royalties to each music artist is too costly. Well, guess what studio pinheads, I hope you take a drastic loss producing these lousy series sets. When you paid the musicians to use their songs intially, why didn't you set up a fair contract to use those rights for later series sets on DVD? I suppose you didn't have enough foresight to see this coming. What a bunch of incompetent jackasses. Do the right thing and pay what needs to paid and you will see your precious profits. We are the customers...and we are always right.

They take all of the DVD seasons currently available and they strap them together to give you every episode ever at a pleasantly discounted price.Pros- all content from the previously released seasons are here- picture quality is excellent- despite their only being 5 boxes you will get all six seasons ( seasons one and two are in one DVD set)- the biggest and most obvious pro is that you get to watch all 110 episodes- no known issues related to double sided discs- all extras from original season are included such as deleted/extended scenes. There are even some extras highlighting lot lines that were dropped from the show. Also expect the occasional gag reel.Cons- ****the biggest and most noticeable con is that with this set you will NOT get the original music from the series. The music has been switched out for royalty free music. This is not the end if the works but you will real a lot of negative reviews due to this. It kinda feels like the soul has been sucked out if the show. If you watch a lot if old shows you will be used to this. See the Wonder years on Netflix for similar disappointment.- the fluffy parkas are included. This was only part of the original separate season 1 and season 2 separated sets.- the messenger bag packaging is not included- small con episodes are on double sided discs. I have not head of any issues with this particular set but double sides discs in the DVD community can sometimes lead to issues from cheap production.This is a fantastic collection and is far cheaper than buying the individual seasons. If you know you love this show then you will love this bundle. If you have never watched this show then you will hopefully enjoy the quirky look at a small town.If stock, royalty free music turns you off you might not want this set but this may be your only chance at ever owning these episode as it appears unlikely that universal is going to pay out for the complete original music. Happy viewing.Edit: after rethinking it I have lowered my review to 4 stars. I have been swayed by others and I feel they are right that the music Is important to the main storyline of the show. I couldn't stand to give this less than 5 originally because the core product is so good.

As it wore on, it seemed like we were repeating the same jokes but this is a problem in most of series tv.  What was fresh and funny becomes over time stale and tired. So I don't know if I can recommend buying this as a whole set.  For a five star experience, seasons one and two can't be beat. So try those first before committing to more.The premise is that a doctor ready to practice, from New York City, tied himself up with the money to pay for his training by agreeing to practice medicine in Alaska.  He ends up in a very tiny town in Alaska.  It has a very few of each essential.  He of course is it as far as doctoring.  There is no hospital.  One has to fly to it. The town is filled with eccentrics.  My favorite is the town big shot, Maurice, a former astronaut.  Every time Maurice was on camera, I was cracking up. He is as puffed up about himself as you would expect.  John Corbett (of Sex and the City) was the radio DJ for a station Maurice owns.  Only the little town receives the signal and it is the only local media around.  Of all the guys on the show, he is the most interesting as far as what women will like.  Rob Morrow plays the doctor and his foil is the feisty female pilot.  These two characters are what started going stale in this show first as there were only so many times you could watch them sparring.  There also was an old guy, Harlan, and his young barmaid Shelley.  They get married and their bar-cafe is the only place to go in town.  So everyone is there on a daily basis.This show reminds me a bit of Newhart with his Inn show as far as carving out a small community of homegrown eccentrics who are the source of weekly hijinks and humor.  Vermont, of course, is not as remote as Alaska but the general idea is the same. Newhart and his wife were also from New York and found Vermont as alien as could be. What the shows had in common is they were both extremely character driven situation comedy shows.I liked both equally and my guess is that if you liked one, you will like the other.",4,Early Seasons Especially Enjoyable & Funny,1270857600,"04 10, 2010",2010,2112,"['fun', 'funny', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'especially', 'early', 'seasons', 'wore', 'seemed', 'were', 'repeating', 'same', 'jokes', 'problem', 'most', 'series', 'tv', 'What', 'was', 'fresh', 'funny', 'becomes', 'time', 'stale', 'tired', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'recommend', 'buying', 'whole', 'set', 'five', 'star', 'experience', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', 'So', 'try', 'first', 'before', 'committing', 'more.The', 'premise', 'doctor', 'ready', 'practice', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'tied', 'up', 'money', 'pay', 'training', 'agreeing', 'practice', 'medicine', 'Alaska', 'up', 'very', 'tiny', 'town', 'Alaska', 'very', 'few', 'essential', 'course', 'as', 'far', 'doctoring', 'hospital', 'One', 'fly', 'town', 'filled', 'eccentrics', 'favorite', 'town', 'big', 'shot', 'Maurice', 'former', 'astronaut', 'time', 'Maurice', 'was', 'camera', 'was', 'cracking', 'up', 'puffed', 'up', 'about', 'would', 'expect', 'John', 'Corbett', 'Sex', 'City', 'was', 'radio', 'DJ', 'station', 'Maurice', 'Only', 'little', 'town', 'signal', 'only', 'local', 'media', 'guys', 'show', 'most', 'interesting', 'as', 'far', 'what', 'women', 'will', 'like', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'doctor', 'foil', 'feisty', 'female', 'pilot', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'started', 'going', 'stale', 'show', 'first', 'were', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'could', 'watch', 'sparring', 'also', 'was', 'old', 'guy', 'Harlan', 'young', 'barmaid', 'Shelley', 'get', 'married', 'bar-cafe', 'only', 'place', 'go', 'town', 'everyone', 'there', 'daily', 'basis.This', 'show', 'bit', 'Newhart', 'Inn', 'show', 'as', 'far', 'carving', 'out', 'small', 'community', 'homegrown', 'eccentrics', 'who', 'are', 'source', 'weekly', 'hijinks', 'humor', 'Vermont', 'course', 'not', 'as', 'remote', 'Alaska', 'general', 'idea', 'same', 'Newhart', 'wife', 'were', 'also', 'New', 'York', 'found', 'Vermont', 'as', 'alien', 'could', 'be', 'What', 'shows', 'had', 'common', 'were', 'extremely', 'character', 'driven', 'situation', 'comedy', 'shows.I', 'liked', 'equally', 'guess', 'liked', 'one', 'will', 'like', 'other']",N/A

The only problem I had at the time was that I was going to College and never did see all of the episodes, but the ones I did see were really funny and great!  I especially liked the fact that the doctor goes up to Anchorage to pay off his college for 3 years and doesn't really know what he's getting himself into, and then he's forced into staying overtime and ends up serving his time in small town Cicely instead.  Well, don't want to ruin this for anyone that hasn't seen it. As far as the music goes, I really don't remember what soundtracks were on there except for this one episode (for some reason I remember the music on this one) and Brian Eno was playing at the end so I remember that one for some reason...Well guess what!!??  The tune I remember is still on that exact same episode AND soundtrack SO I DON'T KNOW what all the hoopla is about ""removing the original music"".Although, I do seem to remember Chris on the radio playing more ""rocked out tunes"" but instead he now plays (it seems like) more ""classical"" tunes...ha-ha and so you can take it for what it's worth - I'll let you decide because I did.  I debated on buying this set for too long and kept listening to the reviews about the change in music.  I'll be truthful with you but I think I agree but disagree with those reviewers.  On one hand I ""seem to remember"" more tunes being in there, but for some reason it doesn't bother me because I'm zoned into the story more.  I'm into the 5th season so far after purchasing this and I seem to enjoy it more now than when it first aired.  It's probably because I like watching it in sequential order and not miss one episode.I see nothing wrong with the music tracks on the DVD...actually I think it makes the series more ""timeless"" now that it doesn't have a ""TIMESTAMP"" such as the music's early grunge and 90's tunes in it anymore.

For years I wanted to get this, but put it off because of the expense and the naysayers about the music. I relied on my 23 original home-taped episodes all this time. I'm happy to say, the naysayers are making a big deal over very little.  All the shows are there, just as I remember them, and I remember a lot of them.  I only noticed a few (maybe 6 or so) episodes where music was changed, or the song didn't seem to fit so I assume it was changed.  Of course I cannot remember every single song, but if any others were changed that I didn't perceive, then they chose the replacement music well enough.  Even if more were changed, even a dozen, that's still only 10 percent out of 110 episodes!  Most everything else is there folks, from the Enya music for Chris' Street Sculpture of Lights, to the haunting music for the Maggie and the Bear episode.NOTE: Get the 2 CD's of Music from the show too!!>> One more suggestion: Stop watching after the 'The Mommie's Curse'.The show was over for me at that point in the literal and emotional sense.  I think the writers should have left it there, with the closing of Joel burning his things and going upriver at night.  It would've left things open to possibility, to imagination....*I remember being disappointed that the writers had Joel go back to NYC in the next-and-last 'Joel' episodes, 'The Quest'.  It's The End.After that, something really happened to the show, the acting, even the writing.  The humor was gone, feels like the balloon was popped and fell flat.  The main catalyst had been removed. I didn't like the Capra's, they were blah [Joel was funny] and the townspeople began to seem out-of-character too.Before Joel left, NX used to leave me feeling lighter and refreshed, the knots in my brain were untied and relaxed. But afterward, it became heavy-handed, depressing, even gave me a headache. That's probably why I didn't remember any of those episodes, except for the closing music on the last one. :-\In closing, I recommend any NX fan purchase this collection.

""Bosom Buddies"" ""Wonder Years,"" 3rd Rock from the Sun,"" (The companies purchase the rights for the songs for the length of their running, but then they pass that charge on to the DVD mills and THEY choose what they want to pay for.They're also the movie hacks who cut minutes out of the show so it'll cut costs on copying and distribution.Then you have great movies like ""Love at First Bite,"" where it never occurred to the movie makers that a particular song could actually be the driving force behind a movie. Then the singing artist says, ""Hey, we need to renegotiate,"" but the industry says, ""Nah, bite me."" I hope enough people don't buy the DVD, or that someone will figure a way to put it back on there. I've been checking to see if any of the VHS's have the original song on it, but haven't found it yet.So, what I do now is check out how many different distributors are selling or have sold a particular show that I really want, and then I compare the DVD's minutes to each other and the original. And I'll even go so far as to call them and ask, because sometimes they tell you. If that doesn't work...go to your search engine and type, ""Has such-n-such dvd or bundle been altered since syndication (tv). Because if it has, then you can be sure there going to be something missing on the DVD you want to buy. Meanwhile, for the ones that need to be captured immediately, like ""Community,"" I didn't hesitate. I know what's coming, and so I bought each season, and will continue to do so, because 1) they're pretty inexpensive, and 2), once they get to the third and fourth leasing, it's gonna suck bad. I shutter to think what they'll do to ""LOST"" in about 3 years, which is why I'm probably going to take the hit and buy whole thing this Christmas.Oh, btw, don't forget that you can sometimes buy the original from the original creator website, but anymore you'll have to ask the same questions.:)Sincerely,One of the few who managed to grab a truly complete set.P.S.

He thought he'd get a big city assignment there like Anchorage, but he got Cicely instead and he has to stay there for four years.His cynicism and bitterness at what he perceives as bad luck is a sort of voice of reality except reality doesn't always win.Quirky, intellectual, philosophical people live in Cicely. All are tolerant of each other and take the time to listen to everyone. Characters are so interesting, nobody watches television (except in one episode in Season Two).In another, Woody Allen's ""mother"" shows up to discuss filmmaking with a local half-Indian boy who wants to become a film director. Grandma Woody and the boy, Ed, sit in the theater and dissect Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries. Grandma Woody concludes, as she told her son Woody, write what you know. write about people. they're only monkeys with car keys.Homages in various forms (daydreams, dreams, wishful thinking) are made to iconic films: Midnight Cowboy, The Graduate, Wizard of Oz, Boys Town and more.Every single episode has something memorable.

There was something just magical about the show.  Maybe I liked it so much because besides being similar to the movie ""Local Hero"" (outsiders visit kooky town in Scotland and fall in love with its charms) it had what I thought was a totally charming slowly developing love story between the lead characters played by Rob Morrow and Janine Turner.  Add to that mix some wonderful story telling, and is it any wonder I had my family express mail VHS tapes of it to me when I lived over in Germany and couldn't watch the show on TV there?Then disaster struck.  Rob Morrow imagined that he could be a big movie star outside of ""Northern Exposure"" and his character was written out of the story line.  I'm sure Morrow is a very wealthy and probably successful man, but I hope that he rues every day he walked away from a TV show that was a huge success and went on to a very short-lived career in the movies.  He just didn't understand that his appeal was expressed through the droll character of Joel Fleischmann.How badly did Fleischmann's slow motion departure hurt ""Northern Exposure""?  To me, it was a mortal blow and I'm not surprised at all that the season his character returned to New York was the last season.  For me, suddenly making Maggie and Chris a pair and ending with them apparently being in love would have found its equivalent in ""When Harry Met Sally"" if at the last minute Bruno Kirby's character had swept Meg Ryan's off her feet while Billy Crystal's moved to Michigan.As for the music substitutions, I just finished watching two episodes with those, and it did not really bother me.  Sure I'd prefer the original music, but refusing to buy the complete collection in the vain hope of it one day being released (or buying an illegal bootleg) is kind of stupid to me.  ""Northern Exposure"" was not a musical or an opera, so the substitutions just aren't that noticeable (to me at least).For those who like these kinds of stories, I'd urge them to see ""Local Hero"" and a British series ""Doc Martin"" that is brilliant (albeit very derivative of ""Northern Exposure"").Local Hero (1983)Doc Martin: Series 1Doc Martin: Series 2Doc Martin, Series 3Doc Martin: Series 4Doc Martin: Series 5",4,Such a wonderful series that ended so unsatisfactorily,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,2458,"['lt', 'even', 'been', 'air', 'seventeen', 'years', ""'m"", 'going', 'put', 'spoiler', 'warning', 'here', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'get', 'mad', 'seeing', 'spoilers', 'now', 'need', 'get', 'life', '>', 'totally', 'fell', 'love', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'was', 'something', 'just', 'magical', 'show', 'Maybe', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'being', 'similar', 'movie', 'Local', 'Hero', 'outsiders', 'visit', 'kooky', 'town', 'Scotland', 'fall', 'love', 'charms', 'had', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'totally', 'charming', 'slowly', 'developing', 'love', 'story', 'lead', 'characters', 'played', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'Janine', 'Turner', 'Add', 'mix', 'wonderful', 'story', 'telling', 'wonder', 'had', 'family', 'express', 'mail', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'when', 'lived', 'over', 'Germany', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'TV', 'there', 'Then', 'disaster', 'struck', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'imagined', 'could', 'be', 'big', 'movie', 'star', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'story', 'line', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Morrow', 'very', 'wealthy', 'probably', 'successful', 'man', 'hope', 'day', 'walked', 'away', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'huge', 'success', 'went', 'very', 'short-lived', 'career', 'movies', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'appeal', 'was', 'expressed', 'droll', 'character', 'Joel', 'Fleischmann.How', 'badly', 'did', 'Fleischmann', 'slow', 'motion', 'departure', 'hurt', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'was', 'mortal', 'blow', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'season', 'character', 'returned', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'last', 'season', 'suddenly', 'making', 'Maggie', 'Chris', 'pair', 'ending', 'apparently', 'being', 'love', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'equivalent', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'last', 'minute', 'Bruno', 'Kirby', 'character', 'had', 'swept', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'off', 'feet', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'moved', 'Michigan.As', 'music', 'substitutions', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'two', 'episodes', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'bother', 'Sure', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'original', 'music', 'refusing', 'buy', 'complete', 'collection', 'vain', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'being', 'released', 'buying', 'illegal', 'bootleg', 'kind', 'stupid', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'was', 'not', 'musical', 'opera', 'substitutions', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'noticeable', 'least', '.For', 'who', 'kinds', 'stories', ""'d"", 'urge', 'see', 'Local', 'Hero', 'British', 'series', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'brilliant', 'albeit', 'very', 'derivative', 'Northern', 'Exposure', '.Local', 'Hero', '1983', 'Doc', 'Martin', '1Doc', 'Martin', '2Doc', 'Martin', 'Series', '3Doc', 'Martin', '4Doc', 'Martin', 'Series', '5']",N/A

1099081,A2ITTIJ2KFSAAC,B000V6LSO0,PALADIN,"[26, 30]","As my wife and I sat down to begin another sojourn in Cicely, Alaska--having not watched the series in several years--I decided to look at the Amazon listing for the Northern Exposure Complete Series Set to see what the value was at 5 years after release.In doing this, I could not help but note the many, many angry and derogatory comments the set has received...some of them quite snide and almost all of them admonishing potential buyers to not purchase the set....  ALL based upon the music track alterations.True,the DVD set does have numerous instances of music replacements, due entirely to the economics of putting out a large dvd set with multiple copywrited music tracks. This is a sad loss, as the music chosen for NE episodes was an integral part of the whole experience.It`s a matter of economics; The makers of the set try to make it affordable so it will sell....Would you have paid $400 for the complete series with all original music intact?Personally, I believe that most people would not...I would not have bought it--I just don`t have that kind of loose money to throw at a DVD set, no matter how much I love the series. For years, I had made do with the grainy old VHS tape set that I had made, and with later re-runs that I copied off of A&E; Network when they re-ran the show after it hit syndication. I was glad to see the series released on DVD for the completeness and the quality of the episodes--music cuts or not.Why was I ready to accept this seeming blatant slap in the face to NE fans?Because at the time frame of the original broadcast, the only recording medium around was VHS tape, and VHS tape is far from perfect resolution at best, and what is worse; the re-runs were cut to allow for additional commercial time.I have read here people stating that they disdain the music- edited DVD release in favor of a 'bootleg' set that they obtained --complete with all original music! They advise that you find yourself a bootleg set before 'waste your money' and  buy the official release.Oh,joy. These people apparently prefer the running time of the episodes to be edited and/or the video quality to be inferior...but hey--they have all the music !Unfortunately, this is a skewed perspective. True, the music of NE was fantastic...BUT, the talented cast and the stories themselves were the point of the show. The music was a great accompaniment to the stories, but it was not the main point. The character interaction was the main thing with the show. That is where the magic of Cicely, Alaska lies, not in the background music. Had the only joy to be found in NE been in the music, then it could have been a radio show.What is worse, purchasing a bootleg so-called 'complete' series set is problematic at best. IF the source material is recordings of the original broadcasts--assuming that the purveyor did in fact, own a VHS Recorder when the series was shown AND used quality tapes at OPTIMUM SP recording speed--then all you will get is STILL ONLY VHS tape-level quality. It cannot look any better than the limited-resolution the VHS medium offered.Further, if the bootleg is made off of the later re-runs, as I noted before; you will be getting episodes that have 3-5 MINUTES CUT OUT.That seems a poor trade-off just to be assured of a few music tracks...tracks which may well have been excised by the re-run anyway, as the music interlude bridges between scenes are among the most readily editable areas of the show, as they do not remove any of the dialogue scenes between characters.It is of course, your choice, but I will state that the DVD release is visually beautiful and episode run-time is complete. The magnificent scenery of the series is something that I have always savored, and I (for one) want that to have as good a resolution as I can get.That means DVD, not grainy old VHS.Well, I`m done here. I just wanted to present a point of view that was not raging about the music cuts as if that is the only thing about the show to consider.Just a little perspective.",5,PERSPECTIVE,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,4013,"['wife', 'sat', 'down', 'begin', 'sojourn', 'Cicely', 'Alaska', 'having', 'not', 'watched', 'series', 'several', 'years', 'decided', 'look', 'Amazon', 'listing', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Set', 'see', 'what', 'value', 'was', '5', 'years', 'release.In', 'doing', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'note', 'many', 'many', 'angry', 'derogatory', 'comments', 'set', 'received', 'quite', 'snide', 'almost', 'admonishing', 'potential', 'buyers', 'not', 'purchase', 'set', 'based', 'music', 'track', 'alterations.True', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'numerous', 'instances', 'music', 'replacements', 'due', 'entirely', 'economics', 'putting', 'out', 'large', 'dvd', 'set', 'multiple', 'copywrited', 'music', 'tracks', 'sad', 'loss', 'music', 'chosen', 'NE', 'episodes', 'was', 'integral', 'part', 'whole', 'experience.It', 's', 'matter', 'economics', 'makers', 'set', 'try', 'make', 'affordable', 'will', 'sell', 'have', 'paid', '400', 'complete', 'series', 'original', 'music', 'intact', 'Personally', 'believe', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'bought', 'just', 'don', 't', 'have', 'kind', 'loose', 'money', 'throw', 'DVD', 'set', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'series', 'years', 'had', 'made', 'do', 'grainy', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'set', 'had', 'made', 'later', 're-runs', 'copied', 'A', 'E', 'Network', 'when', 're-ran', 'show', 'hit', 'syndication', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'series', 'released', 'DVD', 'completeness', 'quality', 'episodes', 'music', 'cuts', 'not.Why', 'was', 'ready', 'accept', 'seeming', 'blatant', 'slap', 'face', 'NE', 'fans', 'time', 'frame', 'original', 'broadcast', 'only', 'recording', 'medium', 'around', 'was', 'VHS', 'tape', 'VHS', 'tape', 'far', 'perfect', 'resolution', 'best', 'what', 'worse', 're-runs', 'were', 'cut', 'allow', 'additional', 'commercial', 'time.I', 'have', 'read', 'here', 'people', 'stating', 'disdain', 'music-', 'edited', 'DVD', 'release', 'favor', ""'bootleg"", 'set', 'obtained', 'complete', 'original', 'music', 'advise', 'find', 'bootleg', 'set', ""'waste"", 'money', 'buy', 'official', 'release.Oh', 'joy', 'people', 'apparently', 'prefer', 'running', 'time', 'episodes', 'be', 'edited', 'video', 'quality', 'be', 'inferior', 'hey', 'have', 'music', 'Unfortunately', 'skewed', 'perspective', 'True', 'music', 'NE', 'was', 'fantastic', 'BUT', 'talented', 'cast', 'stories', 'were', 'point', 'show', 'music', 'was', 'great', 'accompaniment', 'stories', 'was', 'not', 'main', 'point', 'character', 'interaction', 'was', 'main', 'thing', 'show', 'where', 'magic', 'Cicely', 'Alaska', 'not', 'background', 'music', 'Had', 'only', 'joy', 'be', 'found', 'NE', 'been', 'music', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'radio', 'show.What', 'worse', 'purchasing', 'bootleg', 'so-called', ""'complete"", 'series', 'set', 'problematic', 'best', 'source', 'material', 'recordings', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'assuming', 'purveyor', 'did', 'fact', 'VHS', 'Recorder', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'shown', 'AND', 'used', 'quality', 'tapes', 'OPTIMUM', 'SP', 'recording', 'speed', 'then', 'will', 'get', 'STILL', 'ONLY', 'VHS', 'tape-level', 'quality', 'can', 'not', 'look', 'better', 'limited-resolution', 'VHS', 'medium', 'offered.Further', 'bootleg', 'made', 'later', 're-runs', 'noted', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'episodes', 'have', '3-5', 'MINUTES', 'CUT', 'OUT.That', 'poor', 'trade-off', 'just', 'be', 'assured', 'few', 'music', 'tracks', 'tracks', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'excised', 're-run', 'anyway', 'music', 'interlude', 'bridges', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'readily', 'editable', 'areas', 'show', 'do', 'not', 'remove', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'characters.It', 'course', 'choice', 'will', 'state', 'DVD', 'release', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'episode', 'run-time', 'complete', 'magnificent', 'scenery', 'series', 'something', 'have', 'always', 'savored', 'one', 'want', 'have', 'as', 'good', 'resolution', 'can', 'get.That', 'DVD', 'not', 'grainy', 'old', 'VHS.Well', 'm', 'done', 'here', 'just', 'wanted', 'present', 'point', 'view', 'was', 'not', 'raging', 'music', 'only', 'thing', 'show', 'consider.Just', 'little', 'perspective']",N/A

1099093,A1ISW6NMR45Y71,B000V6LSO0,Tome Raider,"[22, 24]","Well, I guess I waited too long to write a meaningful review as it looks like the inventory of these is drying up.  I was trying  to work up the nerve and the energy to write something really penetrating.  Writing a review of my all-time favorite television program is a little bit like a pilgrimage into my own psyche.  Dr. Fleishman's voyage to Alaska started at the exact same time my career started in the infamous ""Inland Empire"" (the vast, heartless, smoggy suburbs east of Los Angeles, also known as ""the 909"").  So much of the malaise which he felt  was parallel to my own.  True, I envied his pristine rural setting which was in most respects the antithesis of mine, but the alienation and disorientation we each experienced  being in a ""foreign land"" was very similar.  I found solace in Joel's journey, and camaraderie in his attempts to adapt to a totally unappealing and foreign circumstance.  I watched each episode with keen anticipation and I somehow felt a little less lonely afterward.Let me say this about the music on this set:  I do remember the original music as being great, but as I watched these episodes almost 20 years after the original broadcasts I found the music they used on this set to fit in just fine.  If you like Northern Exposure, please don't allow this supplanted music to discourage from you buying this set.  They may be re-issuing a new Complete Series version soon, but even then it may not have the original music.  I was really worried about this issue given all the complaints which are voiced in this forum, but when I started watching the discs I completely forgot the issue.  This was a totally satisfactory experience.  The picture quality is excellent and the spiritual core of the show is totally intact.Spiritual Core:  that's right, this show to me ascends to that level.  I  found tremendous encouragement from this show.  It was uplifting in a variety of ways.  Each character added some fresh perspective to life.  Sure, each character was flawed, but the flaws paled in comparison to the redemptive qualities.  The extravagant diversity of ideas and themes was stimulating.  Even though these characters were out in nowhere, they encountered all the great challenges and rewards of a deeply cultured life.Chris was, of course, the philosophical narrator, the conduit for the classical ideas.  The ultimate Renaissance Man, Chris brought the great notions of antiquity straight into the airwaves of Cicely and our living rooms.  Chris's artistic temperament added so much to the depth of this show.  His character is, in my opinion, one of the greatest in the history of television.  I could essay about Chris for a month, but I'll leave him alone with this final observation:  It is has never happened to me before that I watch television and feel like I'm in the presence of great art such as one might see at the Louvre.  But when Chris tossed that piano with the catapult, and the thing flew silently through the air for what seemed like eternity, and then crashed with a cacophonic blast, I said to myself: This is ART history in the making.  It transcended being mere television.  Chris's character was frequently on the cutting edge.  Picasso and Matisse would have talked and drank with him as an equal peer.Ed also had a vision.  An aspiring film-maker and a natural-born Shaman, Ed's innocence and simplicity were in stark contrast to his deeper connections and understandings.  Ed was a good-hearted boy-prodigy, a genius in a black leather biker jacket.  Soft-spoken and loyal to Ruth Ann and Maurice, Ed was quality all the way through.Maggie O'Connell: beautiful, capable, courageous.  One problem: her boyfriends keep getting killed by bizarre forces.  She's haunted by the fear that she has some spell cast on her whereby any man she loves--dies. The last one, she thought he was so handsome, was hit by a crashing satellite--all that remained were boots, mittens, flannel, some antennae and smoke.  So, there's no safe zone for these guys anywhere.Holling  was a classic as well.  Worried that he would outlive Shelley, who was 40 years younger, he represents robust health and the flexible spirit that goes along with that.  The contrast between Holling and Shelley was magnificent, a true romantic synergism for the ages.Maurice was quite the devious one.  If you watched just one episode, or a few, you might be inclined to think that Maurice was a dark character, or possibly even evil.  But, little by little, we saw that Maurice was a victim of his isolation, and that isolation was a result of his success and materialism.  But when push came to shove, Maurice almost always did the right thing.  His seeming disrespect for the untouched wilderness , and his ambitions for development of the region, infuriated us, but at the same time we knew he had a love for the land and the inhabitants of Cicely. His relationship with the highway patrolwoman was hilarious--Maurice needed a woman stronger than himself and he definitely found her!!  She was an Alaskan stalwart for the ages.Ruth Ann Miller was a lovely woman, totally earnest and realistic.  Her store was the repository for all necessities and most luxuries, and the place where the townspeople got their mail and some good gossip.  It's the only place that was needed, along with the Brick.Marilyn:  Never has a television character said so much with so few words.  She kept her Dr. Fleishman in line, most of the time!!  Fleishman had an MD from Columbia, but Marilyn was wired to some higher plane and Fleishman was smart enough to know when he was in the presence of a superior being.Miscellaneous characters:  There were countless folk who came and went throughout the seasons, but let's face it:  Adam, the neurotic world-famous magically-appearing chef with deep ties to the intelligence and para-military world just capped them all. He could cook you a gourmet dinner and then kill you with his fingertip if you irritated him! This character was so extremely angry, haunted, and brilliant that he just seemed to be two or more persons living in one disheveled army-surplus-clad body. Alan Arkin deserves huge accolades for his work creating that character. The Bubble Boy was fascinating: he could sense toxins from around the world inside his bubble.  I thought that theme carried a  relevant and heavy message about how things are really connected.  Then there are the two lesbian women who founded Cicely a hundred years before in the flashback episode--really a great love story from the past. In one of the final shows there was the character who ran a genuine Italian restaurant out of his home, and he was feuding with a neighbor about some petty slight. This problem had to be resolved, or all that great Italian food for the community was in jeopardy! And, of course, Dr. Fleishman was frequently visited by dead uncles, rabbis, and New York friends, both real and imagined.  Chris's black brother also visited on occasion--he and Chris had a mind-link; their different skin color had no bearing on their kinship. There were many others, mostly of mystical orientation--all were brilliant.  There were no weak characters in Northern Exposure, no weak episodes.Dr. Fleishman was the straight man, the sober contrast to the local color.  He represented the shallow values of the Big City, and general detachment that most of us have from the things that really matter.  He did have, however, one redeeming quality:  he was truly a fabulous doctor who was completely devoted to the care and well-being of his patients.  Had Dr. Fleishman been a real doctor, I would switch my primary care physician designation up to him, and I'd fly to Alaska for a visit whenever I got a sore throat.  You can never under-estimate the value of a great doctor, and Joel was exactly that.  Despite his annoying personality, I think Maggie's attraction to him was based on the fact that she respected him as a doctor.  Just as she was a total pro as a pilot, Joel was a pro as a doctor.  There are certain realms where professionalism just takes on an exalted status, and pilots and doctors are two such realms.  This commonality between them was, as I saw it, the bond.  Because, otherwise, Fleishman was a self-absorbed  wimp and whiner  (until the end--I loved the way his character progressed and finally....understood.  Understood Alaska, and his own place in the Cosmos.)  Rob Morrow did a great job playing this character, because it was not a sexy role.  This is a character whom we despise, but who has redemptive qualities and who is ultimately totally redeemed.  His character reminds us that the ""only right time to judge someone is never.""The most important character in the show was really Alaska itself.  I realize the show was filmed in Washington, but by ""Alaska"" I really mean the spirit of Alaska, which is the spirit of untouched, majestic nature.  Even if a viewer has never been in the wilderness before, I think a viewing of Northern Exposure would lead him/her to understand the captivating mysticism of nature, with her ebbs and flows and timeless mysteries and rhythms.  This show reminded me of those hidden currents which exist only out in nowhere.  The peacefulness of wild nature really came through.  Each episode was like an excursion into the outback where you trek in the silent snow, see a bear or two, or a moose or deer.  The bear or moose might even talk to you...or lead you to safety!!  And then you drive the icy highway back to The Brick, where you get a cold beer and a hot bowl of chili.Northern Exposure reminded me of life the way as it was meant to be lived.  There was not much of that in the smoggy, crowded  Inland Empire, the depraved rectum of southern California.  And I will always be thankful to Northern Exposure for refreshing my recollection of the way life  is  supposed to be here on this planet.  Just as some people find comfort in having the family Bible in the parlor, I like having this box set, with its  campy faux-suede bag, stuffed in a cardboard box in the closet, ready to remind me yet again of what matters when the treachery of common suburban life makes murky the important values.",5,"""It's only literature for goodness' sake!!""--Maurice Minniefield",1344643200,"08 11,
