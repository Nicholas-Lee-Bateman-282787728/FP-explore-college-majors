It seems that Laura is wanted for the murder of her boss. I found this opening quite unbelievable - or at least I hope it would be. To have a bunch of storm-troopers breaking into a private home where there is a young child, without any warning that anything was amiss, without any social services official to take care of the boy, and arresting both parents while only the wife apparently was wanted for questioning seemed to me to be incredible. Were there no other suspects for the crime? Except that Laura had an argument with her boss, and her fingerprints were on the murder weapon, were there any other grounds to suspect her and was there any other explanation? Were Laura's fingerprints already on file?Once I got over my initial incredulity, the acting of all concerned was good and the story was nail-bitingly tense. Laura, who is diabetic, gets convicted of the murder though we have no details of the evidence. Because John feels his life falling apart when he fails to get Laura released, he decides to try to break Laura out of jail and for this he enlists advice from a previous felon, Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson). Brian Dennehy has only a minor role as one of the grandparents looking after Luke while John breaks innumerable laws himself to get Laura released. I also doubted if a humble schoolteacher which John was would have the guile and resources to implement such a breakout. But if you can live with the highly improbable story-line, the film itself - a remake in English of a French film, Pour Elle - is very exciting.",4,A tense and dramatic thriller from a rather unbelievable story-line,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,1768,"['John', 'Laura', 'Brennan', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'son', 'Luke', 'Toby', 'Tyler', 'Green', 'are', 'enjoying', 'family', 'meal', 'together', 'when', 'suddenly', 'home', 'broken', 'armed', 'police', 'take', 'couple', 'custody', 'Laura', 'wanted', 'murder', 'boss', 'found', 'opening', 'quite', 'unbelievable', 'least', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'bunch', 'storm-troopers', 'breaking', 'private', 'home', 'where', 'young', 'child', 'warning', 'anything', 'was', 'amiss', 'social', 'services', 'official', 'take', 'care', 'boy', 'arresting', 'parents', 'only', 'wife', 'apparently', 'was', 'wanted', 'questioning', 'seemed', 'be', 'incredible', 'Were', 'there', 'other', 'suspects', 'crime', 'Laura', 'had', 'argument', 'boss', 'fingerprints', 'were', 'murder', 'weapon', 'were', 'there', 'other', 'grounds', 'suspect', 'was', 'there', 'other', 'explanation', 'Were', 'Laura', 'fingerprints', 'already', 'file', 'Once', 'got', 'initial', 'incredulity', 'acting', 'concerned', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'nail-bitingly', 'tense', 'Laura', 'who', 'diabetic', 'convicted', 'murder', 'have', 'details', 'evidence', 'John', 'life', 'falling', 'apart', 'when', 'get', 'Laura', 'released', 'try', 'break', 'Laura', 'jail', 'advice', 'previous', 'felon', 'Damon', 'Pennington', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'only', 'minor', 'role', 'one', 'grandparents', 'looking', 'Luke', 'John', 'breaks', 'innumerable', 'laws', 'get', 'Laura', 'released', 'also', 'doubted', 'humble', 'schoolteacher', 'John', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'guile', 'resources', 'implement', 'breakout', 'can', 'live', 'highly', 'improbable', 'story-line', 'film', 'remake', 'English', 'French', 'film', 'Pour', 'Elle', 'very', 'exciting']",The Next Three Days

Here are some things I liked about it(may not want to read if you haven't seen the film):  the last 30 minutes or so are very suspenseful (although somewhat unbelievable, but in a way that I could live with).  The acting is good.  I liked how the grandpa found out what was going on yet remained loyal to his son.  I thought he was doing it to make up for their lack of relationship, kind of a way of showing his love for his son. I loved the scene with Liam Neeson--very intriguing character that you see for too short of a time. I also liked the scenes where the Russell Crowe character realizes the gravity of what he is doing--when he thinks about robbing the bank, when he fails in the key situation. Here are a few things I didn't like: I almost quit the movie after one of the very first scenes--the argument between the two women in the restaurant.  I thought it was very unrealistic for two women to talk to one another like that, particularly in a public place. The scene was so over the top I was afraid to trust the screenwriter and director with the rest of the movie. Also,I had a hard time liking the wife/mother/unfairly convicted prisoner woman. But by far my biggest complaint was my sense that the writer seemed to be implying that it was alright for our average joe/former solid citizen to rob and and cause the deaths of certain people because, after all, they were only drug dealers and anyway, he had a higher purpose that was worth more than their lives. That attitude left me with a lessened appreciation for the ending of the story.",3,"Good, but with some reservations",1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,1595,"['Overall', 'guess', 'liked', 'movie', 'Here', 'are', 'things', 'liked', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'read', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'somewhat', 'unbelievable', 'way', 'could', 'live', 'acting', 'good', 'liked', 'how', 'grandpa', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'yet', 'remained', 'loyal', 'son', 'thought', 'was', 'doing', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'relationship', 'kind', 'way', 'showing', 'love', 'son', 'loved', 'scene', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'very', 'intriguing', 'character', 'see', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'also', 'liked', 'scenes', 'where', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'character', 'gravity', 'what', 'doing', 'when', 'robbing', 'bank', 'when', 'key', 'situation', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'almost', 'quit', 'movie', 'one', 'very', 'first', 'scenes', 'argument', 'two', 'women', 'restaurant', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'two', 'women', 'talk', 'one', 'particularly', 'public', 'place', 'scene', 'was', 'so', 'top', 'was', 'afraid', 'trust', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'rest', 'movie', 'Also', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'liking', 'wife/mother/unfairly', 'convicted', 'prisoner', 'woman', 'far', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'was', 'sense', 'writer', 'seemed', 'be', 'implying', 'was', 'alright', 'average', 'joe/former', 'solid', 'citizen', 'rob', 'cause', 'deaths', 'certain', 'people', 'were', 'only', 'drug', 'dealers', 'anyway', 'had', 'higher', 'purpose', 'was', 'more', 'lives', 'attitude', 'left', 'lessened', 'appreciation', 'ending', 'story']",The Next Three Days

Two possible scenarios of circumstantial-evidence are presented; one shows innocence; the other guilt. The government presumes the wife is guilty; and so, does not investigate the innocent scenario for evidence. The only circumstantial-evidence presented points to guilt. Even husband, Russell Crowe, has some unspoken doubt. We find out for certain in the end; but you will have to wait.Russell Crowe's wife has lost all legal-appeals. Russell seeks the advice of an ex-con, who successfully escaped from prison; about how Russell can do the same for his wife. You really feel this honest man, Russell Crowe, having to go criminal to try to spring his beloved wife from prison.It is not the depressing film the summary suggests, because you are on Russell Crowe's side from the outset, though sharing his uncertainty, and the film moves fast and clever. Russell does some preparations about which we are curious; we see why later when his plan is played out.Things do not go smoothly for Russell Crowe; some trial & error, and some quick-thinking make this movie realistic.Recently, our government has unionized in self-serving, unconstitutional, conflict-of-interest. Thus, in civil-cases today; some Judges blindly accept the facts of fellow, government-agency-employees and government-lawyers, and so, also, fail to investigate the facts or require proof; leading to corrupt and evil rulings. This film shows the stress of the good citizen having to fight a corrupt, incompetent, evil, government by unlawful means. This is a feel-good film for the private-sector, down-trodden.

I really enjoyed this film and thought it was well-paced and the realism of having to go through something no innocent person has ever had to do. Too many times in Hollywood, the story is written so that this so-called innocent, inexperienced person suddenly knows all of these action moves. Well, in this film, part of its charm is that Crowe is an everyman who knows nothing about the seedy underbelly of the criminal world and having to obtain fake passports, etc. I liked that the movie focused around that. Also, Neeson rocks in a brief, albeit crucial, role as a ""professional prison breaker."" All of the cast is great, even if sometimes underused (specifically Stern, Dennehy); Lennie James is great (as always) and Wilde achieves what her character is there for. Director/screenwriter Paul Haggis did a wonderful job adapting the original French version,Pour Elleto a much broader audience.

I guess it was meant to be that way as Crowes character slowly plotted things out. This is certainly not a movie for teens as they would not last through the first reel before heading for the door screaming in boredom. Yet, patience Grasshopper. There is a reward at the end. That end was a nice payoff and if not for that, I might have been pretty mad.It was well acted out and Crowe played the character well. The way he fooled the cops at the end was especially nice.What I found rather perplexing though was the billing of Olivia Wilde. She is in the movie all right, but her part is rather minor for how her name is so prominently shown in the credits. I really like her as an actress, but her screen time is rather minor. I would say Brian Dennehy had more screen time yet he got barely a mention compared to her. I guess it's her hotness that did it. On the other hand, she really rocked in Tron, but I digress.Russel Crowe is the real star in this movie. Even his wife is a minor character compared to him. The whole movie centers around him and what he does. A man desperate to save his family. It brings up the question of what would any man do to save their own when they know deep down their loved one is innocent. And, in the end scenes, there are a few clues to whether she is or isn't.As I said, the payoff is at the end and makes the slow buildup worth it. Four stars because the buildup was a bit too long.

I hadn't really heard much about it, and honestly I haven't been impressed with Russell Crowe in quite some time.  But he did an amazing job in this movie.  A lot of movies promise a suspenseful ride, but many of these same movies disappoint.  This one did not.The plot line is fairly straight forward.  Russell Crow plays John Brennan.  His wife, Lara, has been convicted of murdering her boss.  He is convinced she is innocent.  After exhausting the appeals process, they realize that she will be in prison for the rest of her life, and their son will have to grow up without a mother.  John cannot accept this and begins to make plans for her escape.  Much of the running time is build up to the actual escape, but it's done very well.  You see the lengths John goes to in planning the escape.  He is forced to make some very difficult decisions, and take some risks to procure the necessary items and most importantly, the money to pull off his plan.  Russell Crowe gives an excellent performance throughout this movie.  He comes off as a down to earth regular Joe, trying to pull off a very daring, very dangerous escape.  He makes some mistakes, but he refuses to give up.  Through it all it is apparent how much he loves his wife and son.Elizabeth Banks, the actress playing John's wife, Lara, does an amazing job as well.  You can see how devastated she is by being separated from her son.  She breaks down when she learns that the last appeal has failed, and it's a very touching scene.The movie really picks up steam during the escape.  There are several cops that are on the trail almost from the very beginning.  These cops seem to be anticipating their every move, and the suspense is amplified as the movie continually leaves you guessing as to whether or not the family will get away.  As for the ending, I'm not giving anything away.  You'll have to watch for yourself to find out.4.5 out of 5 stars (I rounded up since you can't give half stars)",5,Great performance by Russell Crowe,1305763200,"05 19, 2011",2011,2005,"['was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'heard', 'much', 'honestly', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'impressed', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'quite', 'time', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'movie', 'lot', 'movies', 'promise', 'suspenseful', 'ride', 'many', 'same', 'movies', 'disappoint', 'one', 'did', 'not.The', 'plot', 'line', 'fairly', 'straight', 'forward', 'Russell', 'Crow', 'John', 'Brennan', 'wife', 'Lara', 'been', 'convicted', 'murdering', 'boss', 'convinced', 'innocent', 'exhausting', 'appeals', 'process', 'realize', 'will', 'be', 'prison', 'rest', 'life', 'son', 'will', 'have', 'grow', 'up', 'mother', 'John', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'make', 'plans', 'escape', 'Much', 'running', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'actual', 'escape', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'see', 'lengths', 'John', 'planning', 'escape', 'forced', 'make', 'very', 'difficult', 'decisions', 'take', 'risks', 'procure', 'necessary', 'items', 'most', 'importantly', 'money', 'pull', 'off', 'plan', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'excellent', 'performance', 'movie', 'off', 'down', 'earth', 'regular', 'Joe', 'trying', 'pull', 'off', 'very', 'daring', 'very', 'dangerous', 'escape', 'mistakes', 'give', 'up', 'apparent', 'how', 'much', 'wife', 'son.Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'actress', 'playing', 'John', 'wife', 'Lara', 'amazing', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'devastated', 'being', 'separated', 'son', 'down', 'when', 'last', 'appeal', 'failed', 'very', 'touching', 'scene.The', 'movie', 'really', 'up', 'steam', 'escape', 'are', 'several', 'cops', 'are', 'trail', 'almost', 'very', 'beginning', 'cops', 'seem', 'be', 'anticipating', 'move', 'suspense', 'amplified', 'movie', 'continually', 'guessing', 'not', 'family', 'will', 'get', 'away', 'ending', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out.4.5', '5', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'half', 'stars']",The Next Three Days

Crowe evokes lots of empathy as the devoted husband/father who goes over the line to free his possibly innocent wife from a life sentence.  Is he legally right?  Is he morally right?  It's a tough question to answer---the crux of Haggis' script.  Elizabeth Banks gives strong support as the convicted wife, but it's the smaller roles that put the icing on the cake:  Brian Dennehy's stoic father; Jason Beghe as the impassioned cop; Jonathan Tucker and Kevin Corrigan as the doomed meth manufacturers and Olivia Wilde, the pretty mother who befriends Crowe.

He's convincing in many ways, but the film might have worked better without a celebrity.  Having Russell in the driver's seat detracted from the suspense.  Maybe he's too familiar to us.  (Interesting that Amazon lists Liam Neeson's films alongside this - both Taken and Unknown are riveting - and Liam makes a cameo here, almost blowing away Russell Crowe IMHO).To the film's credit, we never quite know where it's heading - will he make it?

While there is nothing wrong with that formula from a business point of view, it does serve to clutter/bog down the cinemas with largely irreverent fare.  Fortunately, ""The Next Three Days"" is a shining example of how a film SHOULD be made.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on the Brennan family.  When wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) is imprisoned for 20 years on a murder charge (her guilt/innocence is unknown until later on in the movie), husband John (Russell Crowe) hatches a scheme to break her out and take their son Luke out of the country to start a new life together.  Along the way, John Brennan gets advice from a former prison escapee (Liam Neeson), must piece together a plan, and then finally decide if he deems himself capable of pulling it off.This movie will not immediately jump to the top of your ""all-time favorites"" list.  What it will do, however, is entertain you for 2+ hours with intriguing characters, an interesting storyline, and enough plot twists to keep you guessing.  It's simple (yet cognitive) entertainment at its finest: sit back, immerse yourself, and stay along for the satisfying ride.Besides the immersive storyline, the acting is also an ""added bonus"".  Crowe and Banks are quite capable of carrying the leading roles, while Neeson, Olivia Wilde, Daniel Stern & even Brian Dennehy have excellent supporting roles, as small as they may be.  Very much reminiscent of earlier Crowe films like ""The Insider"" & ""State of Play"" where the ""surround Crowe with auxiliary talent"" formula also paid off big.Thus, ""The Next Three Days"" is a very entertaining film (though perhaps not an outright classic) that I wish more Hollywood studios would copy.

My question is. Wasn' there an available laptop or cell phone available to overcome this obstacle momentary?Second query: Facial recognition at the airport. Please, for fifteen minutes at least the persecution began. And if the suspicion was founded, sending their faces should never wait that long.Third query: The alleged murderer did not leave a DNA sample on the extinguisher as  murder weapon?Fourth query: After three years the police officer decides to find out if the button argument is valid and goes to the already contaminated the crime scene after so long to check if there is a button yet? In case he had found it, I had thought that the agent was family Mc Giver, be for sure.These four questions make me think that, at the time of writing the script, it must respect the intelligence of the spectator, because otherwise I would be offending waste through these threads?It's a pitiful shame but not having an answer, I prefer to pass.",3,Just four big holes into the script makes me wonder!,1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,2025,"['original', 'proposal', 'promised', 'be', 'interesting', 'was', 'raw', 'material', 'take', 'incisive', 'gaze', 'loopholes', 'lack', 'will', 'entire', 'system', 'time', 'sentencing', 'delicate', 'case.A', 'woman', 'accused', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'husband', 'patiently', 'exhaust', 'possible', 'resources', 'obtain', 'answer.When', 'know', 'only', 'three', 'days', 'rescue', 'wife', 'sent', 'prison', 'moving', 'heaven', 'earth', 'prevent', 'it.Well', 'enough', 'adrenaline', 'comparable', 'seventh', 'game', 'World', 'Series', 'tricky', 'thing', 'escape', 'hospital', 'persecution', 'subway', 'mad', 'rush', 'highway', 'oppressive', 'tension', 'airport', 'minutes', 'boarding', 'plane', 'So', 'far', 'everything', 'dizzying', 'race', 'time', 'press', 'button', 'dramatic', 'climax.But', 'retrospective', 'are', 'four', 'serious', 'questions', 'linger', 'mind', 'leaving', 'cinema.First', 'query', 'When', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'decided', 'cut', 'telephone', 'cables', 'laboratory', 'try', 'call', 'hospital', 'laboratory', 'obviously', 'not', 'responding', 'question', 'Wasn', 'available', 'laptop', 'cell', 'phone', 'available', 'overcome', 'obstacle', 'momentary', 'Second', 'query', 'Facial', 'recognition', 'airport', 'Please', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'least', 'persecution', 'began', 'suspicion', 'was', 'founded', 'sending', 'should', 'never', 'wait', 'long.Third', 'query', 'alleged', 'murderer', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'DNA', 'sample', 'extinguisher', 'murder', 'weapon', 'Fourth', 'query', 'three', 'years', 'police', 'officer', 'find', 'out', 'button', 'argument', 'valid', 'already', 'contaminated', 'crime', 'scene', 'so', 'long', 'check', 'button', 'yet', 'case', 'had', 'found', 'had', 'thought', 'agent', 'was', 'family', 'Mc', 'Giver', 'be', 'sure.These', 'four', 'questions', 'make', 'think', 'time', 'writing', 'script', 'must', 'respect', 'intelligence', 'spectator', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'offending', 'waste', 'threads', 'pitiful', 'shame', 'not', 'having', 'answer', 'prefer', 'pass']",The Next Three Days

1349279,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B003L20IG0,,"[20, 39]","Is it too much to hope that, when a studio has the wherewithal - and budget - to pull together such cinematic luminaries as Russell Crowe, Brian Dennehy and Liam Neeson, that it won't insult its audience's intelligence with the result? Once upon a time, Hollywood threw its big name stars challenging roles, and they produced erudite, artful, memorable and, well, *thrilling* thrillers, likeThe Silence of the Lambs,L.A. ConfidentialorMemento. No longer, apparently.  Nowadays the best you'll get is lightweight fluff likeKnight and Day, and formulaic rubbish like Three Days Left - or whatever this film was called: I am honestly already having trouble remembering. My wife and I sat in a bar afterwards and tried to look on the bright side just to think of something nice to say. At least it wasn't in 3D.This film assembles a (mostly) talented, but (altogether) wasted, big name cast, including one of my favourite, underrated, actors of all time: Brian Dennehy. But Dennehy was so starved of script I wondered at one point whether the actor (now in his seventies) had suffered a stroke and was unable to speak. Joy of joys, eventually he did, briefly, and managed in a couple of stares to generate more acting quality than the rest of the cast put together. Liam Neeson played some sort of escape artist ex-con with a comedy Bronx accent, a Hemingway cap and a preposterous scar across his cheek: he may as well have had a parrot on his shoulder and a wooden leg for the sense his character made (although then he would be less able to ride the motorcycle which the scriptwriters had bestowed on him). Russell Crowe - an actor who has fashioned a career from being a moody, sexy, hard bastard - plays John Brennan, an overweight, credulous and downright wet schoolteacher whose wife is subject to a horrendous miscarriage of justice.Except - and it pains me to admit I'm legally qualified, but I am - I don't think it *was* a miscarriage of justice. More importantly, Brennan is given no cause throughout the film, save guileless and gullible belief in the blamelessness of his wife, to think so either. And nor does director Paul Haggis invest any time in ensuring we are sympathetic to Laura Brennan's cause. Haggis' pedigree is James Bond screenwriting, so I don't suppose he has ever needed to bother establishing his hero, but here the film was lost within the first ten minutes when, in the course of a single petulant exchange, we are introduced to, and invited to immediately dislike, Laura Brennan, a fractious, humourless woman in a blonde wig who is easily baited by her sister-in-law. The fact that Laura lovingly shags her husband in the car afterwards and insists on taking a photo of their nuclear family every day doesn't substitute for decent emotional investment. We actively dislike Laura, and little of her behaviour afterwards does anything to change this. Even her son patently dislikes her.From this unpromising tableau we are led onto John Brennan's thoroughly implausible journey from wet English teacher lecturing on Don Quixote (which would have been funny and clever if Brennan hadn't misrepresented a farce as tragedy) to criminal mastermind, springing his irritating wife from maximum security clink towards a South American lam. This involves preparation: is convention dictates, Brennan duly erects a wall map of his plan: a map of Pittsburgh, photos of security vans, lines joining up all the dots (you know the drill), including, unfathomably, scrawling a budget for the heist on the map, and useful reminders ""GET A FALSE MOUSTACHE"" etc.  ""AND HAT"". Brennan assembles a cast of low life characters (including Neeson and a lip-reading deaf chap, also on a motorbike) to help him execute his plan. Oh, and YouTube, of course, which will tell you how to pick prison locks and open security vans armed only with an old tennis ball.All this to save a highly strung and glacial wife who can't even maintain the affection of her mop-headed son, and who shows no gratitude for her husband's loyalty, no matter how misplaced or, er, quixotic. During his preparation John Brennan encounters a lonesome single mum who inveigles him with come-hither looks, but showing the resolve of a rather deluded saint, merely uses her to effect his plan.You won't be surprised to hear that cuddly schoolteacher makes a better fist of his ludicrous plan than logic would dictate he ought. The last part of the film descends into a frenetic chase across beautiful Pittsburgh (talk about quixotic: Haggis attempts some scene setting shots intended to make Pittsburgh look picturesque), and as convention dictates, the police are by turns brilliant to the point of clairvoyance when tracking and nearly catching him, but moronic beyond belief in the last five yards when apprehension is finally at hand. Not that I wasn't rooting for the hapless cops: wouldn't it be a lovely turn of events if, just once, the perpetually doomed coppers actually got their man?I seem to say this a lot of films, and it depresses me to have to: check your brain at the door, and the two hours will pass quickly enough. But killing time is hardly enough reason to part with a tenner and sit in a dark room.For once,  wouldn't it be nice to take your brain in with you to the cinema?Olly Buxton(*With apologies to

1349280,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B003L20IG0,,"[2, 4]","I'm wavering between condemning this film for its absurdity and accepting it as a parable of sorts.The Next Three Days does beg the question: What lengths will we go to in life to change the course of circumstances, whether those circumstances are fair or unfair?The scene that sticks out in my memory is the discussion that John Brennan is having with his classmates on Don Quixote. He questions:""What if we choose to exist purely in a reality of our own making?""This reference to Don Quixote pretty much parallels Brennan's irrational thinking in attempts to create freedom for him and his wife, in which he takes extreme measures, even acting criminal, to secure this idea. This includes speaking to former ex-cons about escape plans, dealing with drug traffickers, and thinking like a criminal. He transforms from professor to criminal, and rationalizes every wrong act with a flawed scope of truth and reality. To secure his family's freedom is an unfaltering goal.Still, after viewing,  felt a bit off by the plot's absurdity, which seems to have us believe in the unlikeliest of occurrences and that, when faced with a criminal on the loose, law enforcement will find a way to bumble things up in amazing ways. Sometimes we watch a film with full disclosure that it is trying to be fantastical and unreal, and can accept that, but other times, absurd logic may get in the way of an otherwise solid film.

1349285,A5N992ESD6UHW,B003L20IG0,,"[5, 16]","It could have been GREAT! Russell Crowe is outstanding in everything he does and probably one of the best actors of our time. In every role he plays, he puts everything he has into it. ""The Next Three Days"" is no exception. Crowe is on top of his game, as is the rest of the cast, especially Elizabeth Banks. It's good to see her taking on roles with more substance, and after seeing her here, she has reinvented herself after taking on the sappy and unbelievable role of Miri in ""Zack And Miri Make A Porno."" I mean, really, a beautiful woman like that making whoopee with Seth Rogan? C'mon, man...not a chance in h-e-double toothpicks!Anyway, the problem with Three Days wasn't the cast or the production. It was the directing, story editing, and length. There were so many pointless scenes in the first two-thirds of the movie that I could count numerous times the attending masses could get up to retrieve a tub of popcorn, go to the restroom, and subsequently stand outside to watch the cars enter the theater parking lot for five or ten minutes and still not miss anything by the time they all got back. The entire playground scene with the little girl playing ""Tag"" is a prime example. Was that necessary? Absolutely not! It was almost as if they had so little storyline that they created a ton of needless material to fill in the space and then got carried away with it. A majority of this movie should have ended up on the editing floor. Once it was edited properly, and the movie then topped out as an excellent suspense thriller, they could have released it on DVD as an ""Uncut Version"" or ""Director's Cut"" with all the extra junk thrown in there. That would have made much more sense. The only thing that should have focused on in the beginning was getting the viewer to contemplate whether Crowe's character's actions were moral in a humane sense or clinically insane. Nothing more. They achieved this but with far too much baggage brought along for the trip. The main problem with Russell's character, though, is that it is highly unlikely that a history teacher is going to transform into a prison-break artist...no matter what he/she's up against. The proper way to approach this might have been to do some investigating of his own to try and determine her innocence or guilt. Two wrongs don't make a right, and that would pertain to this flick as well. (Slang)>Two-thirds of this movie is wrong, so that don't make it right.&lt;(Slang) Right?The last twenty minutes or so of the movie was excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat suspense that barely made up for the slow, drudging beginning.All in all, for me, this movie gets three stars for casting, acting, and the last twenty minutes...or two stars taken away for poor directing and editing. Either way, it's not any more than a three-star movie.

Unlike Kimble, she can't escape on her own, but needs her husband to get her out the illegal way, after all legal steps have failed. While with Kimble the main story was the near permanency of the flight, here it is the near endlessness of the preparation.Her husband is a teacher, and a decent man. He is as far away from crime and violence as he could have been. He is so innocent that he blames himself for his little boy's problems at school, rather than putting it on the deplorable fact that the mother is a convicted killer. So for him to learn how to free his wife from prison is a major learning process. It is also a project that requires considerable financial resources, and as the housing market is not looking so good just now, and he can't sell his house, he needs to figure out how to come by money in a shorter way.Escapism in its clearest double meaning.P.S.

1349290,A1845IJB63D5H7,B003L20IG0,,"[9, 14]","The Next Three Days:Like his role in ""Robbin Hood"", Russell Crowe landed on a just right story where he could fit into the character with believable emotions and gut feeling. He never believe in his wife's culpability to commit a crime of murder even after she appeared to have been bent to accept a lie made to frame her. His persistence to liberate his wife and unite his family could be easily attributed to any free minded America. The movie ""Inception"" portrayed a similar scenario of a victim of the corrupt justice system that crush many innocent people.Even though in this movie the jury trial was never shown, a lousy defense attorney would have succumbed to the fabrication of the government forensic experts. O.J. Simpson's acquittal from his murder conviction would have never been possible without the hard work of his defense team in exposing the corruption of the criminal detectives.Confronted with lame and mediocre defense attorney that landed an innocent victim behind bars for life, the alternative was resorting to the underworld of crime, money laundering, and all deceptive tricks that could liberate a prisoner and permit the family to flee the land of braves.Every prison's door has a key. But finding those keys was too rudimentary to solve the intricate problem of evading security. With in depth planning, escape from the tyranny of injustice was finally possible.The movie ended on a great note of a united family in a safe and remote place out of harm's way.",5,"Hopelessness, helplessness, and outright injustice.",1292889600,"12 21, 2010",2010,1488,"['Next', 'Three', 'Days', 'role', 'Robbin', 'Hood', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'landed', 'just', 'right', 'story', 'where', 'could', 'fit', 'character', 'believable', 'emotions', 'gut', 'feeling', 'never', 'believe', 'wife', 'culpability', 'commit', 'crime', 'murder', 'even', 'appeared', 'have', 'been', 'bent', 'accept', 'lie', 'made', 'frame', 'persistence', 'liberate', 'wife', 'unite', 'family', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'attributed', 'free', 'minded', 'America', 'movie', 'Inception', 'portrayed', 'similar', 'scenario', 'victim', 'corrupt', 'justice', 'system', 'many', 'innocent', 'people.Even', 'movie', 'jury', 'trial', 'was', 'never', 'shown', 'lousy', 'defense', 'attorney', 'would', 'have', 'succumbed', 'fabrication', 'government', 'forensic', 'experts', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'acquittal', 'murder', 'conviction', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'possible', 'hard', 'work', 'defense', 'team', 'exposing', 'corruption', 'criminal', 'detectives.Confronted', 'lame', 'mediocre', 'defense', 'attorney', 'landed', 'innocent', 'victim', 'bars', 'life', 'alternative', 'was', 'resorting', 'underworld', 'crime', 'money', 'laundering', 'deceptive', 'tricks', 'could', 'liberate', 'prisoner', 'permit', 'family', 'flee', 'land', 'braves.Every', 'prison', 'door', 'key', 'finding', 'keys', 'was', 'too', 'rudimentary', 'solve', 'intricate', 'problem', 'evading', 'security', 'depth', 'planning', 'escape', 'tyranny', 'injustice', 'was', 'finally', 'possible.The', 'movie', 'ended', 'great', 'note', 'united', 'family', 'safe', 'remote', 'place', 'harm', 'way']",The Next Three Days
1349291,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B003L20IG0,,"[9, 16]","Once you realize, once you get how ""The Next Three Days"" will unfold, the movie becomes more an exercise than anything else. As a result, it becomes a little boring.John and Lara Brennan (Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks) are very happily married and have a three year old son, Luke. One morning, the police storm into their home and arrest Lara for the murder of her boss. Three years later, all of the appeals and most of the money are gone and this means Lara will soon be moved  from her temporary home in a large jail to a penitentiary further away, making the frequent family visits difficult. John has to act fast, for the sake of his family, because Lara will not be able to survive the harder life of the maximum security facility. Out of desperation, he contacts Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson), a former convict who wrote a book about his own prison break. He tells John that if he goes through with this plan, he will have a very limited time frame to complete the plan and to do things he might not be prepared to do. John spends a lot of time sitting, watching, planning and then he notices something providing the beginning of the escape plan. He begins to plot everything, and I mean everything, out to the smallest detail on his bedroom wall.Written and directed by Paul Haggis (""Crash"", ""In the Valley of Elah""), ""The Next Three Days"" moves at a fast pace, yet still seems to be an overly long film. It is a misstep for the filmmaker who usually creates far superior films.The story opens with Crowe and Banks out at dinner with his brother and sister-in-law. The two women get into a fight and the dinner breaks up early. But John  and Lara can barely get back to their car before they start ripping their clothes off. The next morning, mom takes a picture of the family, her daily ritual which John deems corny. Then the police burst in and arrest Lara. I'm all for keeping things moving, but this pacing means we have just witnessed all of the scenes Haggis will allow us to get to know about the Brennan's family life. This is an important thing for us to have a good feel for because John will risk everything in his attempt to break his wife out of jail. We have to believe they are madly, passionately in love, so in love that every day of her incarceration seems an eternity. It is a very short period of screen time, of narrative, to build such emotions. We also have to believe every day of Lara's separation from her family is slowly killing her because she misses her husband and son. Both have to be established for us to care, to give a flying fig about whether John is successful or not. It has to be enough to hook us. These brief moments aren't enough to make this work. But Haggis makes an agreement with us. He almost verbally asks us to go along with him for the ride, he'll spend some more time exploring the family dynamic throughout the film.Haggis does deliver on this promise and we get a more complete picture of this small family's dynamic. John's willingness to go to such great lengths seems perfectly normal to us.Haggis is a respected screenwriter and has contributed to many memorable films in addition to the films he writes and directs. You don't get to this point if you can't write a good story or craft memorable, believable dialogue. In ""Three Days"", Haggis seems to concentrate on the plot. Everything is centered around Crowe's attempts to break Banks out of prison. He sits, watches and comes up with a plan. But Haggis is smart enough to throw in some monkey wrenches, the plan can't be too pat or it will become boring. To make things interesting, Crowe will have to change his mind a few times, usually at the last minute.Haggis also introduces elements giving a richer subtext to the story. Many of these same moments will also pay off later, making the story more emotionally satisfying. For instance, when John and Lara are having breakfast, she reminds her husband to call his father (Brian Dennehy) and wish him a ""Happy Birthday"". This allows Haggis to give us a little background about John's relationship with his dad. It isn't a good relationship. Later, as John begins to put his plan together, he leaves his son with his dad and mom. Later, an emotional moment, true to our knowledge of the nature of these characters proves satisfying.As John moves through his plan, putting together all of the pieces, we witness the different emotions playing on his face and in his body language. At one point, John is about to make a bad decision, desperate to close one part of the overall plan. We know it will end badly if he goes through with it. We want to shout at him, tell him to stop. And he seems to hear us. He changes his mind and chooses an equally dangerous, but with slightly better odds.As he goes though these moments, he caresses his son's head, or looks at him with a faraway look. These moments are effective but seem too brief. They get the right feeling across but because we don't live with them, we don't feel them through these characters as we need to. Because John is putting together something so dangerous, we have to believe everything is at stake. If we don't connect with any member of the family, we can't completely invest in the story.When the plan kicks into gear, John moves methodically through the motions. But Haggis throws in some of those monkey wrenches and forces John to make some decisions on the fly.Throughout the film, the two cops (Jason Beghe, lots of TV appearances, and Aisha Hinds, TV's ""Detroit 187"" and ""Hawthorne"") who arrest Lara, are in the background, working to make sure Lara is sent away, to pay for her crime. They pop up occasionally, to remind us of their presence. Then, as John puts his plan in motion, two more detectives (Lennie James and Allan Steele) enter the picture and start to realize what John might be attempting. As all four start to work to find John, the first two detectives begin to think maybe Lara is innocent. Honestly, this is a weak and unbelievable part of the movie. So much so it brings the entire film down a few notches. There is also a coda featuring the first two detectives which is almost maddening, and not for the right reasons.John's plan is an elaborate Rube Goldberg contraption. Everything hinges on a number of things happening at precisely the right moment. And everything hinges on one thing happening over and over again. Once you realize what this is, the movie loses momentum because it no longer has any suspense.Crowe has had a difficult few years. His last few films have been commercial and, in many case, critical flops. In ""Three Days"", his portrayal of John Brennan is not perhaps the most emotional he has ever done. In fact, it feels a little flat because he spends a lot of time sitting and watching. When he does have an emotional moment, they almost seem more perceived than something actually witnessed.Banks, more commonly known for her roles in extremely popular comedies, shows she can handle more dramatic roles. She quickly establishes her role in the family (she has to) and when she is incarcerated, we see the pain and uncertainty in her face.""The Next Three Days"" holds your attention, but still manages to

1349294,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003L20IG0,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","To say that I wanted `The Next Three Days' to be better isn't meant in any way shape or form to diminish it's quality or your preconceived idea of it.  The film is a tightly woven thriller that engages our `suspension of disbelief' without abusing it, remaining for the most part intelligently thought out and compulsively watchable.  Still, I can't help but notice aspects of this film that could have been better.  As with nearly every film made (very few, if any, are perfect), there is usually something that could have been tweaked for a better result, and so one may wonder why bother addressing them all.  It could prove to be tiresome.  The reason I mention this with this particular film is that, with the themes presented here this film could have been OUTSTANDING.  By failing to completely flesh out certain aspects of the film it remains `a good film', but the potential for utter greatness is glaring back at you with beady eyes.Alas, this film is quite good indeed.The film's focus is John Brennan, a good looking middle aged schoolteacher married to a beautiful young woman who has bore him a sweet young son.  John's world is flipped on its head when his wife is accused of murdering her boss and sentenced to life in prison.  When the years trickle by without any real hope of her being exonerated, John either has to accept the harsh reality that his homelife will never be back to normal, or he'll have to take matters into his own hands.While I'm not as `head over heals' for this film as the sites reviewer Bret Fetzer is (to call the supporting cast `outstanding' feels like a total stretch) I must admit that he covers some sound points in his review.  The film is exciting and compelling from start to finish, and it is aided vastly by Crowe's remarkable acting chops.  He digs deep, even deeper than the films script initially allows him to.  He is always adding layers to the character, even when he isn't speaking.  You can feel that this is no longer Russell Crowe but that he is, without doubt, John Brennan.The film's plot has a few holes, especially with the scenes that show John testing out his plans in broad daylight in front of passersby's and never being caught (well there is the one `scare' that goes by under-punished).  Like I said, the film asks you to suspend disbelief, but it also makes sure to lather John's action with enough sound judgment and caution to cause you to believe he can pull this off.But, for me, the film should have slowed things down a tad.  This definitely shows my personal preference when it comes to my movie viewing, but I've always preferred a film that was more `character driven' as apposed to `action driven', and while `The Next Three Days' certainly has the emotional core present, it doesn't explore it as richly as it could have had it elongated it's running time and fleshed out the in-between; filling in those spots between all the planning and executing of this `escape'.  It flirts with this concept by introducing us to a single mother who takes a liking to John, but it shoots it down almost immediately, reducing her presence to a mere prop for John's plans.Alas, the film, for what it sets out to be, is very good.  It is intriguing and exciting and moving.  I'd certainly watch it again, and I have no reservations in recommending this to any and all who are fans of the genre or the star.",4,Well paced and genuinely intense...,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,3377,"['say', 'wanted', 'Next', 'Three', 'Days', 'be', 'better', ""n't"", 'meant', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'diminish', 'quality', 'preconceived', 'idea', 'film', 'tightly', 'woven', 'thriller', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'abusing', 'remaining', 'most', 'part', 'intelligently', 'thought', 'out', 'compulsively', 'watchable', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'aspects', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'nearly', 'film', 'made', 'very', 'few', 'are', 'perfect', 'usually', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tweaked', 'better', 'result', 'so', 'one', 'may', 'wonder', 'why', 'bother', 'addressing', 'could', 'prove', 'be', 'tiresome', 'reason', 'mention', 'particular', 'film', 'themes', 'presented', 'here', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'OUTSTANDING', 'failing', 'completely', 'flesh', 'out', 'certain', 'aspects', 'film', 'good', 'film', 'potential', 'utter', 'greatness', 'glaring', 'back', 'beady', 'eyes.Alas', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'indeed.The', 'film', 'focus', 'John', 'Brennan', 'good', 'looking', 'middle', 'aged', 'schoolteacher', 'married', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'bore', 'sweet', 'young', 'son', 'John', 'world', 'flipped', 'head', 'when', 'wife', 'accused', 'murdering', 'boss', 'sentenced', 'life', 'prison', 'When', 'years', 'trickle', 'real', 'hope', 'being', 'exonerated', 'John', 'accept', 'harsh', 'reality', 'homelife', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'back', 'normal', ""'ll"", 'have', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands.While', ""'m"", 'not', 'head', 'heals', 'film', 'sites', 'reviewer', 'Bret', 'Fetzer', 'call', 'supporting', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'feels', 'total', 'stretch', 'must', 'admit', 'sound', 'points', 'review', 'film', 'exciting', 'compelling', 'start', 'finish', 'aided', 'vastly', 'Crowe', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'chops', 'deep', 'even', 'deeper', 'films', 'script', 'initially', 'always', 'adding', 'layers', 'character', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'speaking', 'can', 'feel', 'no', 'longer', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'doubt', 'John', 'Brennan.The', 'film', 'plot', 'few', 'holes', 'especially', 'scenes', 'show', 'John', 'testing', 'out', 'plans', 'broad', 'daylight', 'front', 'passersby', 'never', 'being', 'caught', 'well', 'one', 'scare', 'under-punished', 'said', 'film', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'also', 'sure', 'lather', 'John', 'action', 'enough', 'sound', 'judgment', 'caution', 'cause', 'believe', 'can', 'pull', 'off.But', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'slowed', 'things', 'down', 'tad', 'definitely', 'personal', 'preference', 'when', 'movie', 'viewing', ""'ve"", 'always', 'preferred', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'apposed', 'action', 'driven', 'Next', 'Three', 'Days', 'certainly', 'emotional', 'core', 'present', ""n't"", 'explore', 'as', 'richly', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'elongated', 'running', 'time', 'fleshed', 'out', 'in-between', 'filling', 'spots', 'planning', 'executing', 'escape', 'concept', 'introducing', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'liking', 'John', 'down', 'almost', 'immediately', 'reducing', 'presence', 'mere', 'prop', 'John', 'plans.Alas', 'film', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'intriguing', 'exciting', 'moving', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'watch', 'again', 'have', 'reservations', 'recommending', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'genre', 'star']",The Next Three Days

1349301,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,B003L20IG0,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[12, 15]","There is a parameter in filmmaking that is not often talked about: to what degree is the director toying with our emotions through editing and story construction? It happens all the time, of course, but do we really want to be conscious of it? No. A story should draw us in carefully, then spring it's trap when the time is ripe.In Paul Haggis' ""family thriller"", The Next Three Days, a remake of a 2008 French film ""Pour Elle"", Russell Crowe plays a devoted husband, loving father, and (of all things) a teacher trying to spring his wife, a convicted murderer, from prison. As with so many other action/suspense films, the driving force that sustains one's interest is ""male goaling"" -- a man overcoming unbelievable obstacles, and, in this case, totally on his own for most of the struggle.What could be more contradictory? An ethical man, a teacher of children, a loving husband, motivated to a ""life of crime"" not for money, but out of love and an overpowering instinct to do what is right. It's certainly a premise with rich possibilities.In the early going, however, I was irritated by some of the film's deficits. In the beginning, there is a shortage of character and location development, followed by a massive continuity jump (with the father and the son), with no explanation. Just going to black and then fading in again on a close up is not a satisfying or credible way to suggest an enormous passage of time, and it is a bit confusing. There was no trial sequence or examination of the evidence as I felt there should have been. The murder in question was not shown in any way, further shrouding the story of ""Three Days"" in mystery.I'll grant Mr. Haggis, that trials with prosecuting attorneys, defense attorneys and judges and juries eat up a lot of time and a lot of movie budget, but of course he would say ""that is NOT where this film is going."" And he's right. Nevertheless, one still has a nagging feeling that skipping over so much crucial material which could help the audience to understand, deprives the audience of a lot of linear continuity. Films do that all the time, but not so clumsily as in this case.In short, Mr. Haggis style of scriptwriting and/or editing is too manipulative. I felt the same way about Mr. Haggis' 2004 best picture, ""Crash"". He is toying with our emotions in ways too obvious, too overt. So I have an argument to make with Mr. Haggis as to why he so selectively chooses to show some sequences and skip over others. This leaves the audience starving for some objectivity -- a difficult thing to quantify, but something you feel in your gut.There is a general shortage of wide open spaces and time pauses to break up the action, too, which might have helped ease us into the story's rhythm.I also think that some details of Three Days -- which, for the sake of not spoiling it for you, I won't go over in detail -- are rather improbable. Other critics have noted this. But life is improbable.Alright, now that I've got that off my chest...if you can be patient enough to get through the first half of ""Three Days"", I promise a marvelous payoff in the second half. This is a terrific movie, despite it's editorial manipulativeness. Though I initially had my doubts, in the end this film redeems itself and leaves a powerful impact.What can I say about Russell Crowe? The guy has an intensity, a capacity for bottled-up anger that Brando once had. Elizabeth Banks delivers a very good performance as the wife in prison, and the scenes of imprisonment are poignant and satisfyingly difficult.The Next Three Days -- weak start, very strong finish. Highly recommended for the Crowe crowd.

To the end of the world--if Russel Crowe's story is to be believed. A sudden turn of events leaves his happy little family in a shambles. Crowe's wife (Elizabeth Banks) is arrested for the murder of a woman, with whom she had had a spat in a restaurant sometime before the incident. The tell-tale ""evidences"" make it an open and shut case, and she gets life sentence with most of her appeals turned down hurriedly.As she gets bitter and even suicidal in her confinement, Crowe, convinced of her innocence, decides to take law into his own hands. With the prejudice of society, even of close relatives, getting more pronounced by the day, the hapless husband scripts a meticulous plan to bring his wife back to freedom: by jailbreak. This escape attempt, in the face of a high security prison system and a super efficient city police department, is quite riveting, and stands to atone some parts which drag on a bit.Another aspect I liked about the movie is the wisdom in not revealing the truth about the crime. This really does not matter to the story. It is the husband's conviction in his wife's innocence that counts. That is the reality Crowe, like Don Quixote, has chosen to exist in, that is for him better than a life in despair. As reminded by the wife in a piece of conversation, he belonged to the reality another world. This insight into a different kind of psychology, when juxtaposed with the hard boiled action scenes--of murders, chases, police operations, acts as a balance and lends its special beauty to the movie.Now back to the dragging parts of the movie. Sometimes things get tedious because many different genres seem to coalesce in the narrative. It is simultaneously a jailbreak action thriller, a study of psychology, a family drama, a whodunit and so on. Many of the details such as the underworld part, the escaping guide by an expert, could have been curtailed to give the movie a taut unfolding.",4,A Latter Day Papillon,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,2009,"['How', 'far', 'will', 'man', 'go', 'prove', 'innocence', 'wife', 'incarcerated', 'murder', 'end', 'world', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'story', 'be', 'believed', 'sudden', 'turn', 'events', 'happy', 'little', 'family', 'shambles', 'Crowe', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'arrested', 'murder', 'woman', 'whom', 'had', 'had', 'spat', 'restaurant', 'sometime', 'incident', 'tell-tale', 'evidences', 'make', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'life', 'sentence', 'most', 'appeals', 'turned', 'down', 'hurriedly.As', 'bitter', 'even', 'suicidal', 'confinement', 'Crowe', 'convinced', 'innocence', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'prejudice', 'society', 'even', 'close', 'relatives', 'getting', 'more', 'pronounced', 'day', 'hapless', 'husband', 'meticulous', 'plan', 'bring', 'wife', 'back', 'freedom', 'jailbreak', 'escape', 'attempt', 'face', 'high', 'security', 'prison', 'system', 'super', 'efficient', 'city', 'police', 'department', 'quite', 'riveting', 'atone', 'parts', 'drag', 'bit.Another', 'aspect', 'liked', 'movie', 'wisdom', 'not', 'revealing', 'truth', 'crime', 'really', 'not', 'matter', 'story', 'husband', 'conviction', 'wife', 'innocence', 'reality', 'Crowe', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'chosen', 'exist', 'better', 'life', 'despair', 'reminded', 'wife', 'piece', 'conversation', 'belonged', 'reality', 'world', 'insight', 'different', 'kind', 'psychology', 'when', 'juxtaposed', 'hard', 'boiled', 'action', 'scenes', 'murders', 'chases', 'police', 'operations', 'balance', 'special', 'beauty', 'movie.Now', 'back', 'dragging', 'parts', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'things', 'get', 'tedious', 'many', 'different', 'genres', 'seem', 'coalesce', 'narrative', 'simultaneously', 'jailbreak', 'action', 'thriller', 'study', 'psychology', 'family', 'drama', 'whodunit', 'so', 'Many', 'details', 'such', 'underworld', 'part', 'escaping', 'guide', 'expert', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'curtailed', 'give', 'movie', 'taut', 'unfolding']",The Next Three Days

Have to admit that I never heard about it before, so I watched it totally unbiased and THEN got curious and checked out the message board on the imdb.com and the reviews here in amazon.com.I have watched many boring movies in my life which got great reviews and had some of the best actors and promising plots, but to me they simply didn't deliver. For some reason this movie seems to be very controversial (I was amazed that there are 9 (!) pages of board messages on the imdb.com...usually there is not more than one page with 7 or 8 topics per film) and lots of people don't like it and claim it's just another average Hollywood production. Well, it's not. It's more than that.First of all it has everything for me that I expect from a great thriller: it's totally unpredictable (good plot with many twists and turns and basically no plot holes), has a great cast, an interesting location, a good soundtrack and it kept me on the edge of my seat from the first minute on. While watching the movie, I got carried away to the point that I forgot it's just a movie (usually I can tell myself while watching movies that this is just a movie). I cannot give any film a bigger compliment than that!For me it doesn't get any better than this!We watch on an average 5 to 6 movies per week (mostly on weekends, we are both movie buffs), moreover we also go to the movie theaters a lot, but when I try to remember the last good thriller that I've seen, it must have has been 2 or 3 years ago.

1349309,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B003L20IG0,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[91, 105]","""The Next Three Days"" is a tight, hard-hitting thriller that had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. I really didn't know, right up to the final moments, how it would end - and because the film had expertly guided me to care about all the characters, even some random losers in a meth lab, I did care about how it would end. The actors are all good with Russell Crowe especially so, and the realistically gritty sets perfectly match the film's desperate tone. Elizabeth Banks' too-good-to-be-true wholesome, sunny good looks are well used. ""The Next Three Days"" reminded me of Hitchcock, and of 1993's ""The Fugitive,"" but it doesn't rise to that level of classic. Rather, it's a well-oiled machine, designed efficiently to crank out the audience's engagement, tension and release.There are a couple of especially good moments. The opening scene could have been satisfactory if all it did was to set the stage for what is to follow, but it does so much more. I'd love to watch that scene again (and again). A women with a plunging neckline spars with Lara, a more modestly dressed woman, about whether or not women can ever get over their competition over men and bond with each other. The scene demonstrates its contents: Ms. D&eacute;colletage uses double entendres to make a pass at Lara's husband, and Lara shows the audience she is quite capable of losing her temper, an important plot point. The brilliant writing in this scene is a bonus. There is a scene involving a sewer drain that economically resolves a question the audience has had for some time. A scene with a car door is similarly powerful and informative. Brian Dennehy's performance as an intimacy-impaired, working class dad is almost wordless and quite brilliant.

Then, it came and went without much fuss, and I didn't catch it till it showed up in our $1.50 theater. To my pleasant surprise, it is a strong film, with a good plot and some great acting. Russell Crowe, Elizabeth Banks, and Olivia Wilde more than make up for Liam Neeson's laughably short cameo--laughable, since his name got a top billing.""The Next Three Days"" revolves around the murder indictment of John Brennan's (Crowe's) wife, played by Banks. All evidence points to her guilt in the death of her female boss, and she gets put away in the county jail, set in the middle of Pittsburgh. The Steel City is a great setting for a film. Director Paul Haggis uses it nicely, making the numerous bridges a part of the film's plot when Brennan, a normally meek-mannered community-college teacher, decides to help get his wife out of prison. Meanwhile, his wife is not fully on-board with his plans, and his son is still grieving the absence of his mother.In the theater, audience members gasped at a few of the surprises--one of which was psychologically believable, but still felt like a bait-and-switch tactic. The audience also gasped at one or two scenes that did not play out in the typical Americanized cinema fashion. Crowe's character is not the slick, former spy, superhero that we saw in Liam Neeson's ""Taken."" Instead, he uses his brain to make his plans, and when brawn comes into the picture he tends to bumble things. The audience seemed to want him to kick butt.Personally, I was thankful for an intelligent thriller that built slowly around characters and plot, unfolded logically but in unique ways, and ended with some emotional satisfaction. But this satisfaction does not come in the typical cinematic last-minute wrap-up, in which everyone gets their due and the good guys lay all their emotions on the table for us understand. There are some understated moments that leave us somewhat unsettled, even as things are tied together. Like Haggis's other films, this is not a paint-by-numbers genre flick.

1349317,AY12DBB0U420B,B003L20IG0,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","Yesterday, my late-night bargain-bin movie was ""The Next Three Days"" starring Russell Crowe. It was a quite good movie that had a very unusual structure. The story started out very slow and relaxed until Crowe's wife was arrested and jailed for a murder. From that time on, the movie progressively accelerated. Toward the end, the pace was just frantic. Then it all very abruptly ended leaving all sorts of unanswered questions. Strange structure. I suppose a lot of people might have found the ending less than satisfactory, but I'll bet they'll be talking about it long afterwards.Crowe played a middle-aged community college professor with Elizabeth Banks playing his wife. They shared a small boy plus the grandparents in their extended household. All seemed like an ordinary happy family until the wife was abruptly arrested and jailed for murder. Crowe thought his wife to be totally innocent, because he knew her, as he put it, but the available evidence seemed to point the other way. Later in the movie, she even admitted her guilt. In any case, Crowe had devised an elaborate scheme to break his wife out of jail, whisk her away and get re-establised in a South American country. It seemed a rather improbably scheme, I might add, and the whole thing was under a tight time deadline. I'd say it was the time pressure that really got things tense as the movie progressed, coupled, of course, with a tight police pursuit. Toward the end the movie became one long chase scene and then with an end that seemed as if someone had slammed the door in your face. Rather well done, I might add.It's a well constructed movie.

It really kept me on the edge of my seat and that doesn't happen very often.Russell Crowe is absolutely brilliant as John Brennan the main character. The rest of the cast is also well chosen and their acting is great. The different characters are nicely developed, convincing and plausible. The dialogs are well written.There are many touching scenes where no words are spoken. It's just the acting and some background music which tell you more than any words could say. The soundtrack is also very well chosen. Layout and scenery of Pittsburgh play an essential part in the story line.The plot is very densely packed and fast-moving and consists of many small scenes. Some of the deleted scenes would have filled some gaps and provided the viewer with some helpful explanations. It's a pity that there is no extended version on the DVD. There are for example deleted scenes that would have explained how John Brennan came up with the plan to tamper with his wife's blood test to get her out of prison.The Next Three Days is definitely one of the best movies I have seen lately but nothing is perfect. You just can't push up the door knob of a car with a tennis ball. There would have been some other means like a device to intercept the door lock mechanism with remote control. John could have obtained such a device from the same shady neighborhood he got the passports from. I also didn't like the scene of Lara trying to throw herself out of the car just because John made a sudden change in plans. Why a second suicide attempt now when she is almost home free? A freaked out Lara pushing at her husband while driving could have just as easily caused the near accident.Anyway, I think the whole story is quite believable even though there are some very convenient coincidences.

1349337,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B003L20IG0,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[4, 4]","The Next Three Days is easily one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. The acting is stellar; there is significant character development and there's suspense, mystery, action and many poignant moments. The film also benefits from solid choreography and cinematography; and the musical score is very well done.  True, some may say that the beginning starts off a little slow; but I think it sets the stage for character development and in that case it's worth it. The plot also has numerous unexpected plot twists and turns as others have noted; just when you think something is about to happen something else might happen instead! That's a fine quality about this film.When the action (and there's quite a bit of action at that) starts, we meet John and Lara Brennan (Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks) who are having dinner with John's brother Mick and sister-in-law Erit (Michael Buie and Moran Atias). We also see just how happy and gratified John and Lara are with their lives: they are very much in love with one another and they adore their beautiful three year old son, Luke (Tyler Green). Suddenly one morning, however, the police and many detectives barge in and arrest Lara for the murder of her boss; Lara is convicted of this murder even though she says she didn't do it. But they have the evidence: people at work saw Lara fighting many times with her boss; Lara's fingerprints are at the scene of the crime; and her boss's blood stain is on her coat.Three years pass as John faithfully makes his trips to the prison, sometimes with their now six year old son Luke (who is now played by Ty Simpkins). John is greatly pained at Lara's emotional deterioration; she tries to kill herself after all legal appeals have failed and she even angrily tells John that she did commit the murder! John, however, doesn't believe Lara did it, not even for a moment.John realizes that he can't be without Lara: she is being transferred to another correctional facility far away and her mental health is only getting worse and worse. In a  frenzy John makes a three day plan to get Lara out of prison at any price--he is going to free Lara but he doesn't tell her for fear that she might try to stop him.Of course, there is much more for you to enjoy watching this film. Did Lara really kill her boss or is that confession to John a symptom of her mental illness? How will John get Lara out; and who will help him make his plans--if anyone? Watch and find out! In addition, look for excellent but all too brief cameos by Liam Neeson as Damon Pennington, a man who escaped from prison seven times and even wrote a tell-all book about it; Olivia Wilde as Nicole, a mother of one of Ty's friends; Brian Dennehy as John's father George and Aisha Hinds does a great job of playing Detective Collero. RZA also has a cameo playing ""Mouss.""I understand that there was at least one Q&A; session with the cast and crew after this movie was released; I would have loved to see this as an extra on the DVD but it is not found here.In short, The Next Three Days is jam-packed with suspense, mystery, pathos and action.

He looked great, totally believable as a loving hubby and father. The writing was great. I will say the first scene and the second (in the car) were not what I would call PG-13 material only because I found it uncomfortable as I watched this with my 14 year old son.  But, I'm a prude when it comes to my own boys ;)This was an adventure, it really kept you wondering what would happen. That was the entire point of the movie...what is going to happen??!! Will they get away with it???  I sat on the edge of my seat the entire time, like the first time I watched Speed, waiting, worrying, wondering!!!!Then came the ending. What a bummer. I almost forgot it was a movie..I wanted to flip the 'book' over and see if I had missed the last page.  The ending was not...bad...it was just unclear. I am pretty sure I get what the 'outcome' was, but this movie reminded me of my soap opera. You know a beloved character is going to have a traumatic thing happen...there is so much build up...weeks or months of it...then when they die/live/come back to life/return to the show...whatever...you are like...huh? What the???!!! Where is the dramatic finish?? The closure!!!?? I wanted closure with The Next Three Days and don't feel I got it.

A lot of people say Russell Crowe is not so nice in person.  I have no idea and never judge except by my own experience.  But he plays the good guy in movies to a T.Here, he tries to save his wife from prison life when all options for getting her out legally are beyond any hope.  He hatches a complicated plan that sometimes falls apart but he keeps reinventing it while all along the way taking care of his six year old  son and keeping him isolated from the goings on.

Absolutists who think implausible causes should be discounted will lack my enthusiasm for this film. In 'The Next Three Days', many small causes win over one big cause. In the world of philosophy, the term is 'a causal chain', one event leads to another and others up to the final effect. Most movies talk one cause for end effect. Quick, neat, familiar.Writer/Director Haggis goes a more complex route, which makes this engrossing, well-acted and written/directed by Haggis film both unusually challenging and satisfying. The price of admission: Thinking is required. But not enough to damped your appreciation for the film. Haggis wrote other recent tricky flicks:Casino Royale (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)and both wrote and directedCrash (Widescreen Edition)Neither are cut-and-dried, both quite complex with ambiguous characters/plots.Just like real life.The advantage of this approach: his films can be seen again and again while still providing their initial impact. Maybe just describe this film is 'equivocal' as well as entertaining. I've seen it twice, end to end; maybe even liked it better the second time through.Nit-pick: the Last-minute proof of guilty or not is rather too-fortuitous and pat and hurriedly presented in a 'What? Did the police consider this initially?' Haggis's faultless direction falters a bit here, logically and in presentation. But really, guilty or not doesn't drive this fine movie. More than any film I've seen recently, this has a character-driven plot. All characters contribute to the mystery one way or another.Another point of logic is why Crowe's character puts such into devising his wife's escape meanwhilestaunchly believing in her innocence (maybe a too-frequent device for such guilty/not-guilty causes?)Yes, another nit pick; but not enough to delete a star from such a fine flick.",5,NOT FOR PEOPLE DEMANDING PAT ANSWERS,1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,1956,"['case', 'who', 'think', 'cause', 'only', 'one', 'effect', 'real', 'life', 'most', 'causes', 'have', 'many', 'effects', 'Absolutists', 'who', 'think', 'implausible', 'causes', 'should', 'be', 'discounted', 'will', 'lack', 'enthusiasm', 'film', ""'The"", 'Next', 'Three', 'Days', 'many', 'small', 'causes', 'win', 'one', 'big', 'cause', 'world', 'philosophy', 'term', 'causal', 'chain', 'one', 'event', 'others', 'up', 'final', 'effect', 'Most', 'movies', 'talk', 'one', 'cause', 'end', 'effect', 'Quick', 'neat', 'familiar.Writer/Director', 'Haggis', 'more', 'complex', 'route', 'engrossing', 'well-acted', 'written/directed', 'Haggis', 'film', 'unusually', 'challenging', 'satisfying', 'price', 'admission', 'Thinking', 'required', 'not', 'enough', 'damped', 'appreciation', 'film', 'Haggis', 'wrote', 'other', 'recent', 'tricky', 'flicks', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Two-Disc', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'wrote', 'directedCrash', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'are', 'cut-and-dried', 'quite', 'complex', 'ambiguous', 'characters/plots.Just', 'real', 'life.The', 'advantage', 'approach', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'again', 'still', 'providing', 'initial', 'impact', 'Maybe', 'just', 'describe', 'film', ""'equivocal"", 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twice', 'end', 'end', 'maybe', 'even', 'liked', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'through.Nit-pick', 'Last-minute', 'proof', 'guilty', 'not', 'rather', 'too-fortuitous', 'pat', 'hurriedly', 'presented', ""'What"", 'police', 'consider', 'initially', 'Haggis', 'faultless', 'direction', 'bit', 'here', 'logically', 'presentation', 'really', 'guilty', 'not', ""n't"", 'drive', 'fine', 'movie', 'More', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'character-driven', 'plot', 'characters', 'contribute', 'mystery', 'one', 'way', 'point', 'logic', 'why', 'Crowe', 'character', 'such', 'devising', 'wife', 'escape', 'meanwhilestaunchly', 'believing', 'innocence', 'maybe', 'too-frequent', 'device', 'such', 'guilty/not-guilty', 'causes', 'Yes', 'nit', 'pick', 'not', 'enough', 'delete', 'star', 'fine', 'flick']",The Next Three Days

For example, drug dealers and gang members have not worn leather jackets since 1955, and &#34;bad guys&#34; haven't ridden motorcycles since 1975.

After she tries to kill herself, he decides to break her out of jail. Although the movie felt somewhat slow for a portion of it, ultimately I have to say that I enjoyed it, and can highly recommend it. Here's why:1. It's a smart movie. It makes you think, and you're not told every last detail up front. In fact, you don't even know if the wife was innocent of murder or not for most of the movie. You're led through the story with pieces to the puzzle, and by the end it all comes together. It was really interesting.2. It was not predictable. I found myself constantly evaluating what was happening, and trying to figure out what would come next. When you think you know what's coming, you realize you don't. It had some interesting turns and twists.Although it started out slow, I think the way it progressed was important for the development of the characters and the story. It was, in my opinion, a good decision to develop the story this way, and worth sitting through.3. It challenges your values. I had to keep wondering if I thought Crowe's character was doing right or not, and I found I kept evaluating whether I wanted him to succeed. Was he a desperate man who was forced to become a hero? Or was he a man who has gone over the edge into darkness? It certainly makes you think.4. The acting was amazing, as you'd expect from Crowe. We think he's one of the very best actors of our time. Elizabeth Banks played the wife, and she was so believable. I was surprised that Liam Neeson had such a very tiny role, and Brian Dennehy, a powerful actor, barely said anything. Still, their presence in the film added to it.5. There was some good action. Not a ton of it though, but enough to keep your adrenaline rushing once in a while. The last portion was edge of your seat exciting.Ultimately I'd say this is a very satisfying movie experience.

This is a film made for Russell Crowe because he has the massive intensity required for the role of an ordinary guy who must throw himself into extraordinary and extremely dangerous situations in order to rescue his wife and save his family. This is a really clever thriller and like all good thrillers, it is unbelievably tense. Partly this is due to the really intense performance given by the great Russell Crowe but the plot is so cleverly devised and executed that this intensity is further amplified to produce a taut gem of a film where no shot is wasted. Liam Neeson's performance, though small, is pivotal to the plot and gives us an indication of where both the plot and Crowe's character are going. I don't want to say too much about the plot because I don't want to spoil it for you but this is an A- grade movie destined to be celebrated by all those who take the time to see it. The film is exceptionally written and beautifully directed by Paul haggis and there are some other beautiful performances by Brian Dennehy, who says a lot with just a look, Elizabeth Banks who gives a carefully calibrated performance of someone under great stress, and Lenny James whose character adds to the tension immeasurably.

A good choice to set the film in....the area is one of the nicest (if not the nicest) big city areas in the country. I used to live in that area and after living in various other places across the country, i really wish i was back there!The film is definitely one that bears ""repeat-watchings"" so i will be definitely buying the blu-ray disc come release day.

After his wife (Banks) is convicted of murder John Brennan (Crowe) comes up with a plan to get her out.  It's hard to go into too much detail about what the movie is about with out giving something away, but this is a very tense, edge of your seat thriller.  It starts off a little slow, but once John's plan is put into action it becomes a very fast paced action movie that you won't be able to stop watching.  Much like he did in ""Crash"" the director (Paul Haggis) is great at dragging out a 5 sec scenario that makes you second guess yourself three and four times before the result is shown.  That makes for a very fun film to watch.  This is an excellent action-thriller (that's saying alot since I'm not a Russel Crowe fan at all) that will not let you down.  Rent it! I give it an A-.Would I watch again? - Yes I would, but also like ""Crash"" it's not one you can watch over and over and have the same effect.",4,A man pushed to his limit will do anything for his family.

1349372,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003L20IG0,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","A gripping thriller ""The Next Three Days"" centers on a Pittsburgh community college teacher John Brennan, (Russell Crowe) a family man whose wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) is arrested for murdering her boss. She denies the charges, and he believes in her innocence, but they have no means to prove it.When he realizes that she may not survive the life in prison, he decides to break his beloved wife out of jail. Being an ordinary English teacher, he has next-to-no skills or connections to draw on, except a few useful tips from a prison-breaker turned author (Liam Neeson) and his strong will not to give in.Based on a 2008 French thriller ""Pour elle,"" ""The Next Three Days"" is a class tale of an average person placed in an unusual situation. The Hitchcock-style character-driven thriller is not about car chases or shootouts. It is about making decisions alone. And those decisions must be right. Luck may help, but what is really vital is will.Director is Paul Haggis, whose works include ""Million Dollar Baby"" as screenwriter and ""Crash"" as co-writer/director. For the American version he changed several parts of the original film. The changes are done by adding materials. So the running time is longer. Not all additions are necessary, I think. The episode about the missing button seems pointless, as the film is after all about John, not Lara.The story itself may not sound very convincing to some, but with strong performances not just from the leads but from the capable supporting actors like Brian Dennehy and Daniel Stern, ""The Next Three Days"" is an enjoyable thriller.",4,Risking Everything for Her: Enjoyable Thriller,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,1583,"['gripping', 'thriller', 'Next', 'Three', 'Days', 'centers', 'Pittsburgh', 'community', 'college', 'teacher', 'John', 'Brennan', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'family', 'man', 'wife', 'Lara', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'arrested', 'murdering', 'boss', 'charges', 'innocence', 'have', 'means', 'prove', 'it.When', 'may', 'not', 'survive', 'life', 'prison', 'break', 'beloved', 'wife', 'jail', 'Being', 'ordinary', 'English', 'teacher', 'next-to-no', 'skills', 'connections', 'draw', 'few', 'useful', 'tips', 'prison-breaker', 'turned', 'author', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'strong', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'in.Based', '2008', 'French', 'thriller', 'Pour', 'elle', 'Next', 'Three', 'Days', 'class', 'tale', 'average', 'person', 'placed', 'unusual', 'situation', 'Hitchcock-style', 'character-driven', 'thriller', 'not', 'car', 'chases', 'shootouts', 'making', 'decisions', 'alone', 'decisions', 'must', 'be', 'right', 'Luck', 'may', 'help', 'what', 'really', 'vital', 'will.Director', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'works', 'include', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'screenwriter', 'Crash', 'co-writer/director', 'American', 'version', 'changed', 'several', 'parts', 'original', 'film', 'changes', 'are', 'done', 'adding', 'materials', 'running', 'time', 'longer', 'Not', 'additions', 'are', 'necessary', 'think', 'episode', 'missing', 'button', 'pointless', 'film', 'John', 'not', 'Lara.The', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'very', 'convincing', 'strong', 'performances', 'not', 'just', 'leads', 'capable', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'Next', 'Three', 'Days', 'enjoyable', 'thriller']",The Next Three Days
