Perhaps many can relate to the charactyers in basic levels, but there is not much love or at least not very well expressed, not much sympathy either, and some compassion for both characters played by John Glover (perhaps the only real ""actor"" in this film).Conclusion: the film is shallow superficial and with only some bright moments provided by J.G and a small scene with JG and Jason Alexander; the rest are just ordinary ""characters/actors"" who dropped by this countryhouse/film.",3,Get all your courage and compassion to watch this Flop,1011571200,"01 21, 2002",2002,966,"['Characters', 'are', 'different', 'stereotypes', 'gay', 'musical', 'queen', 'perfect', 'yuppie', 'couple', 'tormented', 'pianist', 'terminal', 'aids', 'character', 'collected', 'aging', 'dancer', 'handsome', 'dye', 'blind', 'cheating', 'lover', 'hispanic', 'wannabe', 'end', 'movie', 'point', 'never', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'profundly', 'character', 'never', 'can', 'see', 'depths', 'relationships', 'just', 'learn', 'gossip', 'lives', 'how', 'eventually', 'die', 'Perhaps', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'charactyers', 'basic', 'levels', 'not', 'much', 'love', 'least', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'expressed', 'not', 'much', 'sympathy', 'compassion', 'characters', 'played', 'John', 'Glover', 'perhaps', 'only', 'real', 'actor', 'film', '.Conclusion', 'film', 'shallow', 'superficial', 'only', 'bright', 'moments', 'provided', 'J.G', 'small', 'scene', 'JG', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'rest', 'are', 'just', 'ordinary', 'characters/actors', 'who', 'dropped', 'countryhouse/film']",Love Valour Compassion VHS

30029,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,0780620372,Daddy,"[0, 0]","This is a story of friendships and lovers... a group of gay men meet several times a year at the victorian home of one of the men.  Their various relationships and outlooks on life are put on display with each gathering.  Jason Alexander plays Buzz Hauser, afflicted with AIDS, but still enjoying life. (Incidentally, this role was originally to go to Nathan Lane, who, in my opinion, would have done a better job with the character.)  Stephen Spinella plays Perry Sellars, a modest man, devoted to his lover. Stephen Bogardus plays Gregory Mitchell, an aging dancer who stutters. Gregory owns the house and lives with his lover, Bobby Brahms (played by Justin Kirk), a sensitive blind man. Randy Becker plays Ramon Fornos, a young and promiscuous dancer. John Benjamin Hickey plays Arthur Pape, Perry's longtime lover, a sensible and gentle soul. John Glover plays dual roles as twin brothers, John & James Jeckyll, British middle-aged men, total opposites of each other; John is ascerbic and cynical, James is tender and sensitive. Through the course of their gatherings, we watch the changes in relationships; Ramon, who is originally John's lover, has a fling with Bobby; Buzz, one of John's former lovers easily falls for James in a big way. And Gregory maintains his love for Bobby, despite his unfaithfulness. There is perhaps too much bitchiness and sniping at dinner conversations, and maybe not enough depth to the characters. But, the dialog is engaging, there is wit and pathos aplenty, and the seasons of their lives make for a lovely story.  If you buy it for no other reason than to watch John Glover in a brilliant dual role (his character of James steals the show), it is well worth it.",4,Friends and lovers and being alive,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",2012,1703,"['story', 'friendships', 'lovers', 'group', 'gay', 'men', 'meet', 'several', 'times', 'year', 'victorian', 'home', 'one', 'men', 'various', 'relationships', 'outlooks', 'life', 'are', 'put', 'display', 'gathering', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'Buzz', 'Hauser', 'afflicted', 'AIDS', 'still', 'enjoying', 'life', 'Incidentally', 'role', 'was', 'originally', 'go', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'who', 'opinion', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'character', 'Stephen', 'Spinella', 'Perry', 'Sellars', 'modest', 'man', 'devoted', 'lover', 'Stephen', 'Bogardus', 'Gregory', 'Mitchell', 'aging', 'dancer', 'who', 'Gregory', 'house', 'lover', 'Bobby', 'Brahms', 'played', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'sensitive', 'blind', 'man', 'Randy', 'Becker', 'Ramon', 'Fornos', 'young', 'promiscuous', 'dancer', 'John', 'Benjamin', 'Hickey', 'Arthur', 'Pape', 'Perry', 'longtime', 'lover', 'sensible', 'gentle', 'soul', 'John', 'Glover', 'dual', 'roles', 'twin', 'brothers', 'John', 'James', 'Jeckyll', 'British', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'total', 'opposites', 'other', 'John', 'ascerbic', 'cynical', 'James', 'tender', 'sensitive', 'course', 'gatherings', 'watch', 'changes', 'relationships', 'Ramon', 'who', 'originally', 'John', 'lover', 'fling', 'Bobby', 'Buzz', 'one', 'John', 'former', 'lovers', 'easily', 'James', 'big', 'way', 'Gregory', 'love', 'Bobby', 'unfaithfulness', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'bitchiness', 'sniping', 'dinner', 'conversations', 'maybe', 'not', 'enough', 'depth', 'characters', 'dialog', 'engaging', 'wit', 'pathos', 'aplenty', 'seasons', 'lives', 'make', 'lovely', 'story', 'buy', 'other', 'reason', 'watch', 'John', 'Glover', 'brilliant', 'dual', 'role', 'character', 'James', 'show', 'well', 'worth']",Love Valour Compassion VHS

COMPASSION! was a Tony-winning powerhouse on the New York stage--but the same cannot be said of the play's screen adaptation, which plays like a yuppie version of BOYS IN THE BAND that has unexpectedly collided with ON GOLDEN POND... but without much benefit to either.The story itself concerns a group of eight gay men who meet at an isolated but lavish country house for summer weekends and who thrash out their various hopes, desires, and relationships in the process.  In this sort of ensemble piece, where the story is more about people than plot, the cast is key--and in truth the cast is quite fine, with John Glover a particular standout in the dual role of John and James Jeckyll.Trouble is, the gifts of the cast are repeatedly undercut by some of the most uninspired direction and cinematography going, and after a while it all begins to acquire a strangely superficial quality.  I laughed now and then, I felt moved now and then, and I was occasionally impressed with some of the dramatic ideas involved.  But when the final credits rolled I felt the film as a whole lacked any significant impact.

30032,AF3L7GVC6T94P,0780620372,Geminiguy,"[1, 1]","This is a story of differences. Differences of opinions. Differences of lifestyles. Differences of life paths. I could tell that this film was based off of a play when I saw it because of its rich character driven plot and its character development. The standout performance would have to go to John Glover pulling double duty as brothers, one sick with HIV and the other cynical and a dark cloud over his friends happiness. A particularly memorable scene pits Glover with everyone else during a dinning room conversation and everyone tells him what he can do about his opinions to which he snappily, and rather coldly, put every last one of them down. Randy Becker was the films sexual draw because his character exuded sexual desire and hinted at sexual decadance. There is a scene early on that foreshadows his crossing of boundries in a relationship that was decent before he came along. Even after the damage is done, he seems so self centered to really care about who he hurt and who he royally pissed off. Of course, he gets a moment of enlightenment as Greg shows him the other uses a blender has. Justin Kirk does a particularly good job playing the blind Bobby, the unattainable object of Ramon's (Becker) lust. The moment he is introduced, he is feeling the trees in the yard, visualising them with his hand. The moment has a odd erotic feel to it and yet, it is also a picturesque moment of one mans love for the very things others take for granted. Jason Alexander (Buzz) is the signature over the top, flamboyant character. He has some funny bits about music and its downward spiral in the face of diminishing musicals. He comes off a bit depressing until he he meets James (Glover as the better half) and the two fall in love. Both man are infected with HIV and both men are toying with the thoughts of life ending soon. The moments they share on screen are pretty but they are also tinged with a dark, depressing state of hopelessness. Arthur and Perry offer up the role of bickering couple and they flesh out the friends with their bantering about every little thing. In a moment where John spits in Perry's face, the proceeding moment between the lovers is full of anger and yet, as Perry is comforted by Arthur, love. Overall, this is a well done movie. The scenes at the lake are fun and full of eye candy moments. The moment where Buzz sparks a naked chain of events is actually hilarious and a near conclusion dance number (Swan Lake) is lovely and sad as each charater indicates when they die. This is a movie with it all... and all three attributes of the title are clearly displayed. This is definatly a movie worth watching... and it maintains its sense of fun and sadness through the actors amazing performances.",5,"Complex, lovely, and memorable",1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,2739,"['story', 'differences', 'Differences', 'opinions', 'Differences', 'lifestyles', 'Differences', 'life', 'paths', 'could', 'tell', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'play', 'when', 'saw', 'rich', 'character', 'driven', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'standout', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'John', 'Glover', 'pulling', 'double', 'duty', 'brothers', 'one', 'sick', 'HIV', 'other', 'cynical', 'dark', 'cloud', 'friends', 'happiness', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'scene', 'pits', 'Glover', 'everyone', 'else', 'dinning', 'room', 'conversation', 'everyone', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'opinions', 'snappily', 'rather', 'coldly', 'put', 'last', 'one', 'down', 'Randy', 'Becker', 'was', 'films', 'sexual', 'draw', 'character', 'exuded', 'sexual', 'desire', 'hinted', 'sexual', 'decadance', 'scene', 'early', 'crossing', 'boundries', 'relationship', 'was', 'decent', 'came', 'along', 'Even', 'damage', 'done', 'so', 'self', 'centered', 'really', 'care', 'who', 'hurt', 'who', 'royally', 'pissed', 'off', 'course', 'moment', 'enlightenment', 'Greg', 'other', 'blender', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'particularly', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'blind', 'Bobby', 'unattainable', 'object', 'Ramon', 'Becker', 'lust', 'moment', 'introduced', 'feeling', 'trees', 'yard', 'visualising', 'hand', 'moment', 'odd', 'erotic', 'feel', 'yet', 'also', 'picturesque', 'moment', 'one', 'mans', 'love', 'very', 'things', 'others', 'take', 'granted', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'Buzz', 'signature', 'top', 'flamboyant', 'character', 'funny', 'bits', 'music', 'downward', 'spiral', 'face', 'diminishing', 'musicals', 'off', 'bit', 'depressing', 'James', 'Glover', 'better', 'half', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'man', 'are', 'infected', 'HIV', 'men', 'are', 'toying', 'thoughts', 'life', 'ending', 'soon', 'moments', 'share', 'screen', 'are', 'pretty', 'are', 'also', 'tinged', 'dark', 'depressing', 'state', 'hopelessness', 'Arthur', 'Perry', 'offer', 'up', 'role', 'bickering', 'couple', 'flesh', 'out', 'friends', 'bantering', 'little', 'thing', 'moment', 'where', 'John', 'Perry', 'face', 'proceeding', 'moment', 'lovers', 'full', 'anger', 'yet', 'Perry', 'comforted', 'Arthur', 'love', 'Overall', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'scenes', 'lake', 'are', 'fun', 'full', 'eye', 'candy', 'moments', 'moment', 'where', 'Buzz', 'naked', 'chain', 'events', 'actually', 'hilarious', 'near', 'conclusion', 'dance', 'number', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'lovely', 'sad', 'charater', 'when', 'die', 'movie', 'three', 'attributes', 'title', 'are', 'clearly', 'displayed', 'definatly', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'sense', 'fun', 'sadness', 'actors', 'amazing', 'performances']",Love Valour Compassion VHS

Collins ""JCollins""","[8, 9]","Though I'm without the benefit of having seen McNally's original play, it doesn't take a sleuth to figure out this story was meant for the stage. That kind of live performance would certainly help viewers to accept the 'over the top' drama that unfolds in L!V!C!, often with the subtlety of road rage. The men in this film all seem to be railing against the destruction of their lives and/or their relationships.  Though this film is packed with PC moralizing and good-intentioned monologues, the witty script does a fair job of alleviating much of the emotional gloom and doom.  The film's climax is (unfortunately) treated in arty seriousness, and plays like a gimmick to wring-out a few more tears after so much breast-beating.The dialogues and emotional exchanges in L!V!C! are, for the most part, sincere and not affected. Jason Alexander is a marvel as &quot;the little horror under the stairs,&quot; a far-cry from (Seinfeld's) George Costanza. Critics who belittle this part as &quot;stereotypical&quot; are overlooking the obvious: even depressed Opera Queens have stories to share. John Glover reprises his Tony winning dual role and provides this film's standout performance. The supporting cast is visually appealing, if not entirely memorable.The structure of the story (as told over the course of several Summer weekends) is a slight detriment, in that it prevents viewers from seeing the characters in their respective haunts. That means that each of them winds up having to face his inner demons/turmoil because someone else in the group effects a challenge. No alliance is &quot;safe&quot; from harm or change, which makes the interplay fascinating to watch.I guess whether or not you enjoy this film depends on your personal tolerance level for high drama. There is no linear storyline per se, but rather a sense of evolution, toward resignation or acceptance depending on the character. Despite the insular nature of the subject matter, there are plenty of humorous and genuinely moving moments to make the film accessible to a variety of viewers.Incidentally, a DVD release of this film is overdue.-Mic",4,"Disturbing and Over-wrought, but Effective",964569600,"07 26, 2000",2000,2122,"[""'m"", 'benefit', 'having', 'seen', 'McNally', 'original', 'play', ""n't"", 'take', 'sleuth', 'figure', 'out', 'story', 'was', 'meant', 'stage', 'kind', 'live', 'performance', 'would', 'certainly', 'help', 'viewers', 'accept', ""'over"", 'top', 'drama', 'L', 'V', 'C', 'often', 'subtlety', 'road', 'rage', 'men', 'film', 'seem', 'be', 'railing', 'destruction', 'lives', 'and/or', 'relationships', 'film', 'packed', 'PC', 'moralizing', 'good-intentioned', 'monologues', 'witty', 'script', 'fair', 'job', 'alleviating', 'much', 'emotional', 'gloom', 'doom', 'film', 'climax', 'unfortunately', 'treated', 'arty', 'seriousness', 'plays', 'gimmick', 'wring-out', 'few', 'more', 'tears', 'so', 'much', 'breast-beating.The', 'dialogues', 'emotional', 'exchanges', 'L', 'V', 'C', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'sincere', 'not', 'affected', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'marvel', 'quot', 'little', 'horror', 'stairs', 'quot', 'far-cry', 'Seinfeld', 'George', 'Costanza', 'Critics', 'who', 'belittle', 'part', 'quot', 'stereotypical', 'quot', 'are', 'overlooking', 'obvious', 'even', 'depressed', 'Opera', 'Queens', 'have', 'stories', 'share', 'John', 'Glover', 'Tony', 'winning', 'dual', 'role', 'film', 'standout', 'performance', 'supporting', 'cast', 'visually', 'appealing', 'not', 'entirely', 'memorable.The', 'structure', 'story', 'told', 'course', 'several', 'Summer', 'weekends', 'slight', 'detriment', 'viewers', 'seeing', 'characters', 'respective', 'haunts', 'up', 'having', 'face', 'inner', 'demons/turmoil', 'someone', 'else', 'group', 'effects', 'challenge', 'alliance', 'quot', 'safe', 'quot', 'harm', 'change', 'interplay', 'fascinating', 'watch.I', 'guess', 'not', 'enjoy', 'film', 'personal', 'tolerance', 'level', 'high', 'drama', 'linear', 'storyline', 'se', 'rather', 'sense', 'evolution', 'resignation', 'acceptance', 'depending', 'character', 'insular', 'nature', 'subject', 'matter', 'are', 'plenty', 'humorous', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'moments', 'make', 'film', 'accessible', 'variety', 'viewers.Incidentally', 'DVD', 'release', 'film', 'overdue.-Mic']",Love Valour Compassion VHS

This film version of the Broadway play about gay friends who spend three summer weekends together is incredibly clich&eacute;, forced, and feels anything but spontaneous.Old friends getting together could be interesting, but all these people talk about is being gay and it gets old fast.  There isn't one line of dialogue that is believable or one character that rings true; they're too glib and there's no connection between them or with me.

The other characters were more subdued and tolerable, but they still perform like they're reciting lines; there are no pauses or nuances, their characters have no real love, valour, or compassion.This MUST have played better on the stage, since most of the cast is from the play, but it misses the mark on the big screen.

Then I said jeepers the gay guys in this movie are so totally queenie!  I was right on the verge of shutting down the DVD player a few times but just as I was tired the Movie to shift on me and get really good.Its not the movies fault, this time the flaw was in the viewer not the subject matter being seen.  I am spoiled by most of todays movies that unfold quickly and take little or no time for real character development.  I was filled with pre-concieved idea on where I felt the plot would zig and at every turn it zagged.This movie defied me.  The characters were queenie, witty and rich with layers of personality slathered on to the point where they felt real something else I am not used to in most movies.  At first I did not honestly care about any of the characters and worse I could not even imagine myself liking any of them.  As time passed I did however find myself loving the characters or at least identifying with each of them in different ways.Love! Valour! Compassion! is the first movie I have ever seen with a sad ending that is not really totally sad.  My word for this movie is real.  This movie was bold in that it did not end with a warm and fuzzy text book ending and neither did it end in utter tradegy.  The movie just left you thinking about how valuable friends are.  This movie forces you to realise how important every moment of your life is.I guess this movie won me over because it shows the real complexity of friendships the good the bad the warts and all. Love! Valour! Compassion! made me think but more it made me appriciate my life and friends even more.  Love! Valour! Compassion! did not leave me sad it just left me changed for the better in what exact ways I have not figured out yet.  Love! Valour!
