Images, like ghosts of insubstance, stained your heart and soul staying with you long after. I did not live in Australia then, but I now do. But it gripped me the way the landscape folded around the story. Not an outback landscape but the suburban equivalent. You think it is tamed but it grows faster, more lush than is safe. Anthony Lapaglia is one of those underrated actors who you see in action films but who has immense presence and can act. In his role in this film he is in his element as the alpha male/bull elephant tackling human emotions like Hillary climbing Everest in a pair of shorts and sandals. As in you are pulled into the role and left gasping. It is a great piece of cinematic story telling.

694438,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0000639HN,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 9]","Nearly a full sweep at the Australian version of the Oscars, Lantana does boast a beautiful cast and an emotional subject, but it is the delivery of the core roots of this film that quickly take Lantana's kneecaps out.  This is a film about trust.  Lantana builds its premise and focus around characters that are untrustworthy, that have no reason to be trusted, and finally asks us to forget what we ""think we know"" or have heard to discover a killer among them.  We are given strangers.  Strangers, like in Anderson's Magnolia, are twisted together haphazardly in hopes that their random stories will bring the film closure as well as evoke a conversation about trust around the office watercooler.  What transforms Lantana from classic noir film to another chatty film with a disappointing conclusion is the misdirection of the characters.  Lantana boasts amazing acting, and it did just that.  Lantana boasted a mystery that needed to be solved, and it did just that.  Lantana boasted flawed characters which would evoke emotion, and it did just that.  The issues begin as the film nears the center that these elements, while good on their own, do not allow for a strong enough overall film.  The confusing circumstances that reach sporadically at the weak threads of this film are painful to watch, and will eventually transform an avid viewer into a dulled participant.Where did Anthony LaPaglia come from?  Sure, I had seen him in other films like Empire Records and The Salton Sea and the television series Without A Trace, but it wasn't until this film was I able to witness his true acting ability.  After watching Lantana, I must admit, LaPaglia needs to get more work.  While I didn't see him as the center of this film (that goes to Hershey's character), I did think that he outshined even the great Geoffrey Rush.  He was intense and intimidating while powerfully giving us a very conflicted human character.  Rush was my second favorite of the film, his toned performance gave me goosebumps as I questioned his motives and logic.  Hershey was adequate.  Her character provided very little (outside of the central plot) and required even less.  Her chemistry was disjoined, while her delivery seemed unmotivated.  The same could be said for most the other characters outside of Rush and LaPaglia.  These two tremendous actors stapled the film, while the rest seemed to simply move the plot closer to the ending credits.With such powerful acting, why didn't this movie succeed in my mind?  For me, it was the flawed story.  Director Ray Lawrence needed to define this film better.  What was the overall message?  Was it sympathy for our characters or was it an entire film about the power of trust?  I could see both, but they were blurry.  It was obvious that trust was the underlying moment in Lantana, but it was so blazingly pushed in your face that it became tedious quickly.  I see the value of building distrust around your central characters only to demonstrate the power of trust overall, but in this film it just didn't work.  Lawrence's pacing destroyed any chances of this being a strong theme.  From the beginning we are pushed with this idea of trust in so many main directions such as Leon's adultery, the flirtatious neighbor, the openly gay affair, and the death of a child, that when it is provided to us in short verse, aka the son smoking weed and the wife's confused moment in the car, it just seemed overwhelming.  I needed, alas wanted, a stronger story.  I did not want to have to wait for nearly an hour for the plot-point to happen.  Lawrence painfully made us wait, under developing characters that we fully understood early in the film, and focusing lengthily on minute details, forgetting the overall picture that this film could have accomplished.Lantana had every element for success.  The emotional characters, the Magnolia connection, a disturbing murder, a plant (actually a weed) that only waxed the surface of symbolism; these were all synonymous with success, but Lawrence could not put the puzzle pieces together with ease.  It nearly drives you to the brink of madness when you realize that everything was in place, it was the mind behind the camera that could not control it.  I wanted the story to work, the characters were engrossing enough, I just felt that overall the haphazard themes and overplayed obstacle of ""trust"" was just chaotic.  There wasn't enough rhythm, there wasn't enough balance, and there wasn't enough honest connections to make Lantana worth a second viewing.  One scene the immediately comes to mind was that when LaPaglia was running down his street and accidentally hits a random stranger.  Later, we learn that person is not as random as we thought, but by that point our apathy towards the film is already in full swing.  Director Ray Lawrence tried to mimic what Paul Thomas cornered in Magnolia, but the end result was like tasting boxed wine instead of vintage.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Most men hold something

Had I read the hype, I would have been disappointed.  As it was, I found it mildly enjoyable though somewhat unsatisfying.What works - the performances, particularly La Paglia, Rush, and Blake.  Some incredible work by the actors and actresses in creating life-like (though profoundly depressing) characters.  Likewise the cinematography.  It's creepy, yet realistic and engaging.What doesn't - I'm not quite sure.  Could be the script.  Could be the editing.  Either way, there's just not quite enough there.You spend the first part of the film becoming invested in these characters - most of whom are unlikeable on one level or another.  But, as a viewer, you suspend these feelings and engage.Then comes the web - they are all connected by bizarre coincidences.  OK, neat.  Now as viewers, we are waiting for some resolution - tie in.  It is a mystery, after all.  We want to know WHO and WHY.And we wait.  And wait.  And what's this, an epilogue set to beautiful music.  Beautifully ended, but the answers that a viewer needs most just aren't there.  The only real satisfaction is the revelation that Rush's character's true whereabouts when she was leaving her messages.Perhaps I'm not intellectual enough to connect the dots - always a possibility - but in the end, I felt a little like a little kid working a 500 piece jigsaw puzzle, only to find the last three pieces had been left out of the box.

With all its promise and truly surprising, utterly haunting climax, &quot;Lantana&quot; in my opinion falls short of being a masterpiece. Why? Although the story's premise is original and often provocative, the characterization never develops beyond the superficial or two dimensional. Leon Zat, the detective, is one example. His inability to feel, his flirtation with adultery and his ambivalence towards his wife more or less define him. As a character like most of his fellow characters, he never shows much complexity as a human being. His strengths, his frailties, his idiosyncrasies have all been muted; at times he seems barely literate. As for Barbara Hershey's competent portrayal of the psychiatrist who swings between her terrible grief and consuming need, if she has any complexity it's all been translated into neurosis.Perhaps it's restraint on the screenwriter's and director's parts, the idea that less is more: Or that we can never really know anybody, least of all ourselves.  If, like these characters, we rely primarily on surface impressions, live oblivious to others' feelings and base our modus operandi on immediate self-gratification , no doubt we never will truly know anyone, including ourselves.As a thriller, Lantana is quite good.

More than anything else it is a sad film; you ache for the characters, even the ones who cheat on their spouses. Anthony LaPaglia, Kerry Armstrong and Barbara Hershey are outstanding!(Seeing Barbara Hershey here as a troubled psychiatrist recalls her other brilliant performances in films such as A KILLING IN A SMALL TOWN-an extremely well-made and chilling tv movie from 1990.)Set in Australia, LANTANA opens with a dead woman lying in a field with one shoe missing. This shot and the nighttime driving scenes (as well as the segues) may remind you of MULHOLLAND DRIVE. LANTANA is not as twisting and complex as MULHOLLAND nor as cinematically beautiful, but it is just as strong and powerful in echoing themes of relationships gone bad, sorrow, loss, misunderstanding and miscommunication.Anthony Paglia plays a cop who is cheating on his wife, Sonja, played by Kerry Armstrong. (He later becomes involved in investigating the death of the woman from the fields. In the beginning you may wonder how the various people involved are all going to intertwine. Don't worry; they do!) Kerry Armstrong, who resembles Natalie Wood a bit, also is marvelous as Sonja, a caring wife and mother who yearns for restoration in her marriage and life and who does more than her part to try and make her marriage work.LANTANA is one of those rare undderrated, underexposed films that seems to fall quietly in your lap when you're looking for anything that is not overexposed (which translates to most Hollywood films.)",5,For your thinking and feeling pleasure...,1029715200,"08 19, 2002",2002,1646,"['LANTANA', 'not', 'thriller', 'what', 'package', 'thrilling', 'movie', 'watch', 'not', 'what', 'may', 'want', 'think', 'More', 'anything', 'else', 'sad', 'film', 'ache', 'characters', 'even', 'ones', 'who', 'cheat', 'spouses', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'Kerry', 'Armstrong', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Seeing', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'here', 'troubled', 'psychiatrist', 'other', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'films', 'such', 'KILLING', 'IN', 'A', 'SMALL', 'TOWN-an', 'extremely', 'well-made', 'chilling', 'tv', 'movie', '1990', 'Set', 'Australia', 'LANTANA', 'dead', 'woman', 'lying', 'field', 'one', 'shoe', 'missing', 'shot', 'nighttime', 'driving', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'segues', 'may', 'remind', 'MULHOLLAND', 'DRIVE', 'LANTANA', 'not', 'twisting', 'complex', 'MULHOLLAND', 'cinematically', 'beautiful', 'just', 'strong', 'powerful', 'echoing', 'themes', 'relationships', 'gone', 'bad', 'sorrow', 'loss', 'misunderstanding', 'miscommunication.Anthony', 'Paglia', 'cop', 'who', 'cheating', 'wife', 'Sonja', 'played', 'Kerry', 'Armstrong', 'later', 'involved', 'investigating', 'death', 'woman', 'fields', 'beginning', 'may', 'wonder', 'how', 'various', 'people', 'involved', 'are', 'going', 'intertwine', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'do', 'Kerry', 'Armstrong', 'who', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'bit', 'also', 'marvelous', 'Sonja', 'caring', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'restoration', 'marriage', 'life', 'who', 'more', 'part', 'try', 'make', 'marriage', 'work.LANTANA', 'one', 'rare', 'undderrated', 'underexposed', 'films', 'fall', 'quietly', 'lap', 'when', ""'re"", 'looking', 'anything', 'not', 'overexposed', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'films']",N/A
694445,A1IBC9XP2LICQL,B0000639HN,A. Wolverton,"[5, 6]","As 'Lantana' begins, we see through a long camera shot a dead body in the midst of thick shrubbery.  We don't know who this person is or how the death happened.  But we will learn this and much, much more.Australian policeman Leon Zat (Anthony LaPaglia) is a man stumbling through life.  He is in poor health, he is cheating on his wife Sonja (Kerry Armstrong), and can no longer relate to his sons and their problems.  Sonja, having her own problems, seeks the help of a psychiatrist named Valerie (Barbara Hershey).  Valerie has just written a book that chronicles the death of her young daughter.  Valerie's husband John (Geoffrey Rush) is distant, but hiding an inner anger.  At one point in the film, Valerie confronts him, telling him that he's not dealing with their daughter's death at all.  He tells her that he is, he just doesn't have to write a book about it.Zat's lover Jane (Racheal Blake) is a strange woman who is separated from her husband.  She wants nothing to do with him.  Living next door to Jane is the only happily married couple in the film, Nik and Paula.  Or are they really happily married?The characters and the situation I've described sounds like a bad soap opera.  Far from it.  Director Ray Lawrence takes all of these seemingly unrelated characters and shows us not only what they have in common, but how our lives can turn out if we're not careful.It is surprising how easy the plot is to follow with all these characters.  You're never sitting there watching the film thinking, ""Now, who is this man?""  Concentrate instead on what the characters are thinking and feeling.  By doing this, you can tap into the depth of the characters and their sad and sometimes tragic lives.  'Lantana' is, if nothing else, a powerful look into the potential darkness that hides in each of us.

694446,A1RKD1I8MW1LG6,B0000639HN,BeachReader,"[16, 18]","I thought this award-winning Australian movie was incredibly well-done and I am still mulling it over days after seeing it. Every character was fully developed and every performance by this stellar group of actors was outstanding. The confluence of the lives of the various characters was natural and did not seem at all contrived....the movie really was about their interactions and relationships, an examination of deep issues, not a murder mystery as some might think prior to seeing it. Much of the film appeared to try to mislead us as characters who never might have met each other became intimately acquainted. Leon is married to Sonja but sleeping with Jane who lives next door to Nik and Paul. Sonja is seeing a psychiatrist whose disappearance Leon investigates.Suspicion abounds in ""Lantana,"" as it does in real life. Intimacy and its accompanying trust is scarce, except for Nik and Paula. Most of the characters demonstrate that once happiness is no longer part of a relationship, people move through their lives on auto-pilot, their lives routine and predictable.Much is hidden beneath the surface here - ""lantana"" is a tangled nuisance shrub in Australia, with hidden thorns masked by beautiful flowers....much as the unpleasant parts of life can be hidden by what is on the surface.I liked what James Berardinelli said about this movie: "" Being alive and living are not the same......What constitutes happiness - is it the presence of pleasure of the absence of pain? What is the strongest foundation for a lasting marriage - trust, love, familiarity, or grief?""When I read the reviews, I was afraid ""Lantana"" was going to be confusing but it wasn't at all. The characters were so well introduced and developed that it was easy to follow the story right from the beginning.

694448,A3MPEDYM4DGS5O,B0000639HN,BigSPEEGS,"[2, 3]","I always have a hard time connecting to these big ensemble pieces dealing with marital relationships. For example, I always thought ""The Ice Storm"" was missing something, and even parts of the mostly intriguing ""Magnolia"" seemed a little hackneyed. So coming out of Ray Lawrence's ""Lantana"", I wasn't in the least bit surprised to find myself completely unmoved.Dr. Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey) is a psychiatrist and author of a book about her daughter's death (entitled ""Elanor""). One night, she disappears off of the main road. Detective Leon Zat (Anthony LaPaglia), whose wife Sonja (Kerry Armstrong) visits Dr. Somers regularly to talk about their relationship, is called in to investigate the case. The problem with that is thus: the main suspect is the neighbor of the woman he is having an affair with (Jane O'May, played by Rachael Blake). He constantly grills Dr. Somers' husband John Knox (Geoffrey Rush) to find out more about his wife's ""emotional state"". I think that is enough for me to say before I ruin some of the film's few surprises.""Lantana"" is undoubtedly a strongly acted film. Kerry Armstrong and Geoffrey Rush in particular, who for the most part are at the receiving end of the emotional blows, are solid. Barbara Hershey, Rachael Blake and Anthony LaPaglia also bring the film to a slightly higher level. The film is also well shot. The film's opening shots, first of a lantana bush then zooming in on a lifeless body, are eerie and almost haunting. However, although the cinematography of ""Lantana"" is well crafted, there are continuous long, lazy shots of this lantana bush that appear one too many times and push its symbolism way too much. That was a thorn in the side of crafty, although not all together innovative, cinematography.The plotting of ""Lantana"" is, to be honest, complex and intricate. However, it is this intricacy that ultimately proves to be the film's downfall. It seems it would rather be content with weaving in and out of various relationships than letting us connect with any of them. We know how the relationships stack up, but we have no feeling for any of it. We are told how the characters feel about each other, but since the development of each one is so rushed, we can know nothing about the individuals. Yet, by the end, ""Lantana"" expects us to care deeply about each person, even those ones who have little significance in the big picture.""Lantana"" is a well controlled, almost masterfully handled film. Ray Lawrence knows exactly how he wants to get where he wants to go, but takes one too many shortcuts. I was involved with ""Lantana"", but was untouched by it; I walked out of the theater feeling cold. Films like this are often well done but are almost always forgetting one thing: that a relationship stems out of two individuals, the individuals cannot necessarily be defined by their relationships alone.

In a great opening shot, it starts with the implication that there has been a murder, but it moves steadily into a study of people, basically four couples, and how they come together in ways that are deeply emotional and questioning. Anthony LaPaglia plays Leon Zat, a Sydney detective who is trying to find out who the body is and what happened. He's married, burned out, unhappy, with a lot of stuff ready to explode. He's having a joyless affair with a woman, but he loves his wife and kids. His wife sees the marriage falling apart and doesn't know what to do about it. She's been seeing a psychiatrist, but this woman has problems of her own...a daughter who was murdered and a husband who has become frozen emotionally.I know, it sounds like some weekday soap. Believe me, it isn't. The actors are uniformily superb. Besides LaPaglia, there's Geoffrey Rush, Barbara Hersey, and a number of Australian actors who should be better known in the U.S. If you only know LaPaglia from cop and gangster roles, TV crime shows and as the thick-headed hood/nephew in The Client, you're in for a revelation.

694457,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0000639HN,Dennis Littrell,"[37, 38]","In this starkly realistic examination of love and infidelity among the thirtysomething crowd from down under we learn that you may desire to cheat on your spouse, but it's better if you don't.Leon Zat, a police detective played with an original and striking demeanor by Anthony LaPaglia, cheats on his wife and finds that his adultery compromises not only his marriage but his performance on the job.  He becomes irritable and flies off the handle at things of little importance, and becomes consumed with guilt.He is not alone.  The marriage of John Knox (Geoffrey Rush) and psychiatrist Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey) is falling apart as Knox seeks something from the outside and Somers is torn apart with the suspicion that he is having a homosexual affair, perhaps with one of her clients.  Meanwhile Jane O'May (Zat's adulteress played by Rachael Blake) finds that she needs a man, or maybe two, other than her estranged husband.  Even Sonja Zat (Kerry Armstrong) feels the pressure and yearns to feel attractive, perhaps with younger men.More than halfway through we have an apparent murder and an investigation during the course of which some of the adulteries come to light and cause the participants to examine themselves and their lives closely.Andrew Dovell wrote the subtle, richly attired script, full of penetrating dialogue and an uncompromising veracity, adapting it from his play Speaking in Tongues.  Ray Lawrence directed in an unusual but compelling manner in which the scenes are sharply focused and cut to linger in our minds.  Again and again I was startled with just how exactly right was something a character said or did.  Lawrence's exacting attention to detail gives the film a textured and deeply layered feel so that one has the sense of real life fully lived.  The cast is uniformly excellent although LaPaglia stands out because of his most demanding role.  His performance is one of the best I have seen in recent years.  The only weakness in the film is a somewhat lethargic start, partially caused by Lawrence's cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; scene construction and editing.  What he likes to do is lead us to a realization along with the characters and then punctuate the experience by lingering on the scene, or in other cases by cutting quickly away.  Often what other directors might show, he leaves to our imagination, and at other times he shows something seemingly trivial which nonetheless stays in our mind.  John Knox's affair, for example, is not shown.  Jane O'May and her husband's reconciliation is left to our mind's eye.  Yet the scene with Valerie Somers in the lighted telephone booth (with graffiti) is shown at length and then what happens next is not.  These are interesting directorial choices.The ending comes upon us, as it sometimes should, unexpectedly, but then resonates so that we can see and feel the resolution.  Not everything is tied up.  Again we are left in some cases to use our own imagination.This original film, one of the best of the new millennium I have seen, stayed with me long after they ran the closing credits.

Why, I thought, doesn't an otherwise intelligent woman--a psychiatrist yet--who has wrecked her car, and has walked several kilometers down a dark lonely road to a pay-phone, call 911 (or its Australian equivalent)? And I found Anthony Lapaglia simply unappealing. That was then.I have since watched the film several more times. As for my first complaint, I have come to understand the onslaught of hysteria in the physician who is in need of healing herself. As for Anthony Lapaglia, I have gotten used to him (The traditional handsome Hollywood hero he isn't!) and have come to admire him in the television show, ""Without A Trace."" Therefore I have cast aside my initial prejudice and now fully appreciate what an accomplished actor he is in ""Lantana."" Lapaglia is an excellent foil for Geoffrey Rush, who turns in a moving performance as the twice-bereaved Professor of Law.The director presents a series of relationships that are as thorny and thick as the lantana hedges--which seem alive with shrilling cicadas--that run riot along the Sidney roadsides.

AND PLEASE CAN WE HAVE A MOVIE WHERE THINGS DON'T EXPLODE EVERY FIVE MINUTES.I saw this movie when it originally came out and it unfortunately was touted as the best thing since sliced bread. Tough to live up to, but hype aside it is a nice mystery where the characters are more important than who done it and in this case who was done in.I won't reveal any details about this movie as some reviewers felt it necessary to tell you who was done in and although it's ultimately not as important as the characters in the movie, it does give a slowly moving film a needed punch as several clues and red herrings about several aspects of the story serve as enhacements.The performances, with the exception of Barbara Hershey who is ok, are flawless. Even secondary roles are fleshed out and played by very strong actors. I may be somewhat unfair to single out Hershey as part of her role in the movie is to portray a profession that always seems like a cliche when seen on screen.I liked this movie and in many ways reminded me of Robert Altman's pictures, where there are a plethora of characters that somehow have something to do with one another. The pacing is also Altmanesque and that will bother some viewers who want the movie to move faster than it does. Although I generally like the slow pace when the material warrants it, here I think that the movie could have done with a shorter running time by cutting some scenes which seem repetitive and maybe trimming a character or two.Not big complaints here. I don't think that this is the greatest movie I've seen, but it is 100 times better than your good domestic release without the pretention that sometimes accompany said efforts. With the realms of what it is, I would highly recommend it over the wildly overrated ""The Deep End"", another similar genre movie that came out that same year.",4,"Not a perfect film, but one to check out",1064102400,"09 21, 2003",2003,2096,"['Given', 'frustration', 'vast', 'amount', 'junk', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'recently', 'have', 'been', 'seeking', 'smaller', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'wear', 'independent', 'patch', 'navel-gazing', 'exercises', 'instead', 'focus', 'characters', 'people', 'rather', 'plot', 'devices', 'PLEASE', 'CAN', 'WE', 'HAVE', 'A', 'MOVIE', 'WHERE', 'THINGS', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'EXPLODE', 'EVERY', 'FIVE', 'MINUTES.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'touted', 'best', 'thing', 'sliced', 'bread', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'nice', 'mystery', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'who', 'done', 'case', 'who', 'was', 'done', 'in.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'details', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'felt', 'necessary', 'tell', 'who', 'was', 'done', 'ultimately', 'not', 'as', 'important', 'characters', 'movie', 'give', 'slowly', 'moving', 'film', 'needed', 'punch', 'several', 'clues', 'red', 'herrings', 'several', 'aspects', 'story', 'serve', 'enhacements.The', 'performances', 'exception', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'who', 'ok', 'are', 'flawless', 'Even', 'secondary', 'roles', 'are', 'fleshed', 'played', 'very', 'strong', 'actors', 'may', 'be', 'somewhat', 'unfair', 'single', 'out', 'Hershey', 'part', 'role', 'movie', 'portray', 'profession', 'always', 'cliche', 'when', 'seen', 'screen.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'reminded', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'pictures', 'where', 'are', 'plethora', 'characters', 'somehow', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'one', 'pacing', 'also', 'Altmanesque', 'will', 'bother', 'viewers', 'who', 'want', 'movie', 'move', 'faster', 'generally', 'slow', 'pace', 'when', 'material', 'warrants', 'here', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'shorter', 'running', 'time', 'cutting', 'scenes', 'seem', 'repetitive', 'maybe', 'trimming', 'character', 'two.Not', 'big', 'complaints', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'greatest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', '100', 'times', 'better', 'good', 'domestic', 'release', 'pretention', 'accompany', 'said', 'efforts', 'realms', 'what', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'wildly', 'overrated', 'Deep', 'End', 'similar', 'genre', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'year']",N/A

While this is usually the death knell for a mediocre film, it works here because the overall story isn't melodramatic.It's about a bunch of people with tangled lives that make and poor choices.  It's also about the opportunity for redemption, which some characters get and some characters miss by the end of the film.

694470,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000639HN,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 8]","""Lantana"" begins with the camera revealing a dead body in a wooded thicket.  The obvious questions are whose body is it, how did it get there, and who did it?  After all a dead body pretty much signifies a murder mystery, but this 2001 film from director Ray Lawrence, adapted by Andrew Bovell from his play ""Speaking in Tongues,"" does not fit the conventions of that genre.  The is a cop, Detective Leon Zat (Anthony LaPaglia), but what is important is not that he is on the case of the woman who shows up missing but that his life is already connected to her.Who is the woman whose body is waiting in the thicket to be discovered is not really a secret in the film, but there is a moment or two when you suspect it might not be who you think it is going to be and I think you should let this film reveal itself to you the same way it revealed itself to me.  That is because the chance meetings of strangers and acquaintances end up with some unexpected resonances as the story proceeds.  The only mistake is to expect there to be any big moments in this film, because it is about how small ones add up.  This is a story where finding your house has been cleaned is adding insult to injury.Detective Zat is the central character, not because he becomes the investigating officer for the case of the missing woman, but because he is the most obvious surrogate for the viewer.  Zat is waiting for something big to happen.  He is cheating on his wife and believes two one night stands do not constitute an affair.  He has chest pains but does not think that is a warning of a heart attack.  He resorts to violence with a suspect or a man on the street without much provocation.  We wait for his life to explode, but instead it implodes.His wife, Sonja (Kerry Armstrong) is seeing a psychiatrist, Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey), to whom she confides that it would not be the physical betrayal that would hurt if Leon is having an affair, but the fact he would not tell her.  Valerie is married to John Knox (Geoffrey Rush) and eighteen months ago their daughter was killed.  She wrote a book and however he is dealing with the loss is buried beneath a facade his wife cannot penetrate.  One of Valerie's clients Patrick Phelan (Peter Phelps) is a gay man who keeps talking about his married lover to the point that Valerie suspects the lover is her own husband.  Jane O'May (Rachael Blake), the woman that Leon has been cheating with, is separated from her husband Pete (Glenn Robbins) and lives next door to Nik (Vince Colosimo) and Paula Daniels (Daniella Farinacci), a happily married couple.The key to the film is how the characters who do not have obvious connections meet each other.  Valerie and Pete meet on the street, which leads to Pete and Leon talking to each other in a bar.  The film serves as a reminder that sins of omission can have consequences as serious as more overt acts.  More importantly, as sins they are such small things, which serves to make there significance all the more surprising.  When that one character disappears it affects the rest in subtle ways and with unexpected repercussions.  The result is that ""Lantana"" is a quiet film, but one that runs much deeper than you would suspect.",5,A film on the quiet sins of omission and happenstance,1114992000,"05 2, 2005",2005,3220,"['Lantana', 'camera', 'revealing', 'dead', 'body', 'wooded', 'thicket', 'obvious', 'questions', 'are', 'body', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'there', 'who', 'did', 'dead', 'body', 'pretty', 'much', 'signifies', 'murder', 'mystery', '2001', 'film', 'director', 'Ray', 'Lawrence', 'adapted', 'Andrew', 'Bovell', 'play', 'Speaking', 'Tongues', 'not', 'fit', 'conventions', 'genre', 'cop', 'Detective', 'Leon', 'Zat', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'what', 'important', 'not', 'case', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'missing', 'life', 'already', 'connected', 'her.Who', 'woman', 'body', 'waiting', 'thicket', 'be', 'discovered', 'not', 'really', 'secret', 'film', 'moment', 'two', 'when', 'suspect', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'who', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'think', 'should', 'let', 'film', 'reveal', 'same', 'way', 'revealed', 'chance', 'meetings', 'strangers', 'acquaintances', 'end', 'up', 'unexpected', 'resonances', 'story', 'proceeds', 'only', 'mistake', 'expect', 'be', 'big', 'moments', 'film', 'how', 'small', 'ones', 'add', 'up', 'story', 'where', 'finding', 'house', 'been', 'cleaned', 'adding', 'insult', 'injury.Detective', 'Zat', 'central', 'character', 'not', 'investigating', 'officer', 'case', 'missing', 'woman', 'most', 'obvious', 'surrogate', 'viewer', 'Zat', 'waiting', 'something', 'big', 'happen', 'cheating', 'wife', 'two', 'one', 'night', 'stands', 'do', 'not', 'constitute', 'affair', 'chest', 'pains', 'not', 'think', 'warning', 'heart', 'attack', 'violence', 'suspect', 'man', 'street', 'much', 'provocation', 'wait', 'life', 'explode', 'instead', 'implodes.His', 'wife', 'Sonja', 'Kerry', 'Armstrong', 'seeing', 'psychiatrist', 'Valerie', 'Somers', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'whom', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'physical', 'betrayal', 'would', 'hurt', 'Leon', 'having', 'affair', 'fact', 'would', 'not', 'tell', 'Valerie', 'married', 'John', 'Knox', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'eighteen', 'months', 'daughter', 'was', 'killed', 'wrote', 'book', 'however', 'dealing', 'loss', 'buried', 'facade', 'wife', 'can', 'not', 'penetrate', 'One', 'Valerie', 'clients', 'Patrick', 'Phelan', 'Peter', 'Phelps', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'talking', 'married', 'lover', 'point', 'Valerie', 'lover', 'own', 'husband', 'Jane', ""O'May"", 'Rachael', 'Blake', 'woman', 'Leon', 'been', 'cheating', 'separated', 'husband', 'Pete', 'Glenn', 'Robbins', 'next', 'door', 'Nik', 'Vince', 'Colosimo', 'Paula', 'Daniels', 'Daniella', 'Farinacci', 'happily', 'married', 'couple.The', 'key', 'film', 'how', 'characters', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'obvious', 'connections', 'meet', 'other', 'Valerie', 'Pete', 'meet', 'street', 'Pete', 'Leon', 'talking', 'other', 'bar', 'film', 'reminder', 'omission', 'can', 'have', 'consequences', 'as', 'serious', 'more', 'overt', 'acts', 'More', 'importantly', 'sins', 'are', 'such', 'small', 'things', 'make', 'significance', 'more', 'surprising', 'When', 'one', 'character', 'rest', 'subtle', 'ways', 'unexpected', 'repercussions', 'result', 'Lantana', 'quiet', 'film', 'one', 'much', 'deeper', 'would', 'suspect']",N/A
694471,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B0000639HN,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[3, 4]","The influence of Robert Altman is strongly felt in this powerful drama, in that the storyline technique he pioneered with Nashville of events that make disparate characters converge is here used to powerful effect.An unhappily married cop--Zat--played quite well by Anthony LaPaglia--is tense and uncertain enough about his life to engage in a brief affair with another woman and occasionally fly off the handle at his wife, his partner, and others in the immediate area.  His wife suspects the affair and begins seeing a psychiatrist--Barbara Hershey in a great performance--who is also unhappily married, and who suspects her own husband of having an affair with another man.Zat's partner, a woman, is interested in a man she occasionally sees at a restaurant she frequents--the same man Zat bumps into while jogging.  The psychiatrist's husband, played by Geoffrey Rush in an understated and effective performance, finds Zat obtrusive during his relentless questioning regarding his wife's disappearance--she's inexplicably missing one night.  These are a few examples of the convergence of character-driven events that Ray Lawrence, the director, uses to drive the film onwards.This is not as much a movie about relationships as it is about uncertainty.  What do I really know about this person I've been with all these years?  How do I really feel about him/her?  If I don't really know the answer to this question, what do I do about it?  How do I do what I want without hurting somebody?  If I do hurt somebody, then what do I do? The idea of using the Altman technique to explore uncertainty IN relationships, between people, is a great one, and it's used here extremely well.When we see these characters converge with potentially overly coincidental events, this works because the emotional tones (both under- and over-) in the film are strongly developed, so much so that the convergences seem exactly right.The one minor gripe I have is that LaPaglia, though born in Australia, veers back and forth between a halfway decent Australian accent and an obvious American one.  Other than that, this is a very strong film and definitely worth seeing.",4,Altmanian Australia,1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,2155,"['influence', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'strongly', 'felt', 'powerful', 'drama', 'storyline', 'technique', 'pioneered', 'Nashville', 'events', 'make', 'disparate', 'characters', 'converge', 'here', 'used', 'powerful', 'effect.An', 'unhappily', 'married', 'cop', 'Zat', 'played', 'quite', 'well', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'tense', 'uncertain', 'enough', 'life', 'engage', 'brief', 'affair', 'woman', 'occasionally', 'fly', 'off', 'handle', 'wife', 'partner', 'others', 'immediate', 'area', 'wife', 'affair', 'seeing', 'psychiatrist', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'great', 'performance', 'who', 'also', 'unhappily', 'married', 'who', 'own', 'husband', 'having', 'affair', 'man.Zat', 'partner', 'woman', 'interested', 'man', 'occasionally', 'restaurant', 'same', 'man', 'Zat', 'jogging', 'psychiatrist', 'husband', 'played', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'understated', 'effective', 'performance', 'Zat', 'obtrusive', 'relentless', 'questioning', 'regarding', 'wife', 'disappearance', 'inexplicably', 'missing', 'one', 'night', 'are', 'few', 'examples', 'convergence', 'character-driven', 'events', 'Ray', 'Lawrence', 'director', 'drive', 'film', 'onwards.This', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'about', 'uncertainty', 'What', 'do', 'really', 'know', 'person', ""'ve"", 'been', 'years', 'How', 'do', 'really', 'feel', 'him/her', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'answer', 'question', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'How', 'do', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'hurting', 'somebody', 'do', 'hurt', 'somebody', 'then', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'idea', 'using', 'Altman', 'technique', 'explore', 'uncertainty', 'IN', 'relationships', 'people', 'great', 'one', 'used', 'here', 'extremely', 'well.When', 'see', 'characters', 'converge', 'potentially', 'overly', 'coincidental', 'events', 'emotional', 'tones', 'under-', 'over-', 'film', 'are', 'strongly', 'developed', 'so', 'much', 'convergences', 'seem', 'exactly', 'right.The', 'one', 'minor', 'gripe', 'have', 'LaPaglia', 'born', 'Australia', 'veers', 'back', 'forth', 'halfway', 'decent', 'Australian', 'accent', 'obvious', 'American', 'one', 'Other', 'very', 'strong', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

Lantana is a plant with delicate leaves and sharp brambles which was transported into Australia and has now run wild.  The screenwriting is making the same point as the passions and frustrations of the characters take over their personas.A detective, played by Anthony LaPaglia, is having an affair.  His wife is going to a psychiatrist, played by Barbara Hershey.  This psychiatrist has suffered her own emotional upheaval.  Two years before her 11-year-old daughter was murdered and now her husband, played by Geoffrey Rush, is emotionally distant.  In spite of her training, she's judgmental about extramarital affairs and the subject of trust.  Add to this mix a happily married couple with three small children who live next door to the woman the detective has romanced, a female cop who is full of good advice, and several other characters who are looking for emotional connection and we have an interesting plot about how paths cross and how we're all connected.And then one of the women disappears and murder is suspected.  Everything quickens up as the murder investigation touches on each one of these people's lives.  There's emotional upheaval throughout and the conclusion is logical and satisfying.  I was swept into the story as well as the emotions.  At times it felt so real that it became painful.  The acting was outstanding and so was the directing.  And by the end of the film I felt I personally knew all of the characters with all their strengths and weaknesses.

The fear inherent in our world, causes suspicion and distrust which gets in the way of having healthy loving relationships. There is one scene at the end that touched me almost as much as the sister to the main character in Bread and Roses did. Anthony La Paglia's acting ability is enormous. He is not seen that often in American films but he is definately one of the best actors around! I just saw him in The Bank and his acting is just as good. The movie revolves around several different characters and how they connect together and either disconnect or become closer. It has an Altman edge to it but without all the busyness. The movie is clear cut but is heavy with deeper meanings thread into its fabric. Another really good actor is the wife of La Paglia. I have not seen her before or not that I can remember but she is definately endowed with great acting ability! The distrust each character feels shows an emptiness or hole in their personal lives which spreads into their jobs. It spreads just like the plant which is named for the movie. Lantana was brought to Australia and grows out of control. It shows the plant often in the movie. A must see for someone who enjoys movies that prompt growth and discussion.

Set in Australia, its symbolism is reflected in the lantana bush, a beautiful flowering plant that is almost a supporting character in the movie.  The lantana, I am told, can be controlled and cultivated to make a lovely garden, if it is nurtured.  Left to its own devices, it grows out of control.  Such are the relationships in this film, many of which teeter on the brink, and some that end due to neglect, confusion and frustration.Lantana is a tale of four marriages - and the beginning of a love affair.  All can be nurtured back to health, if the parties desire, but all are nearly extinguished in the film.  There is a serendipity in the coincidental intertwinings of the characters (yes, ala Robert Altman!).  The central character, Leon Zat, played by Anthony LaPaglia, is frustrated and angry as his marriage and career become meaningless to him.  LaPaglia is the reason I gave the film only four stars.  He's been a favorite of mine, and although his performance is credible, Lawrence neededa central figure whose chemistry with the ensemble made the need, past love and dialogue believable.  LaPaglia does a workmanlike job, but the film could have been a classic with Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, or Kevin Spacey (I nominate him for every good leading role!) who could have created the onscreen heat with wife Sonja (the sensuous and talented Kerry Armstrong), lover Jane (Rachael Blake in a strong performance), and his partner, Claudia (Leah Purcell is luminous.Leon's a cop, and the film opens with a jolting view of a hidden body.  We know it is a woman, but which one?  Later in the film we meet Jane's estranged husband - her neighbors Nik and Paula, and another central couple - Dr. Somers (Barbara Hershey) and John Knox (Geoffrey Rush) as a psychologist who treats Sonja; grieving with John over the loss of a murdered daughter.  Rush and Hershey are impeccable as a couple, and new comers Vince Colosimo and Danielle Farinacci ( Nik and Paula)shine in the film.  Their sense of love and trust, despite betrayal, make the viewers finally believe in married love again.A unique love story wrapped around a murder mystery, Lantana also explores, in brief, the relationships between the men in the cast - in an honest and thought provoking way.Although it may evolve too slowly for some, Lantana is a lush, visual portrayal of the nature of married love as it ages; and leaves you with both a sense of renewal and pain.I look forward to more films by Lawrence.",4,Almost 5 stars....,1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,2598,"['Lantana', 'was', 'quietly', 'lauded', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'films', 'finely', 'crafted', 'effort', 'director', 'Ray', 'Lawrence', 'Set', 'Australia', 'symbolism', 'reflected', 'lantana', 'bush', 'beautiful', 'flowering', 'plant', 'almost', 'supporting', 'character', 'movie', 'lantana', 'am', 'told', 'can', 'be', 'controlled', 'cultivated', 'make', 'lovely', 'garden', 'nurtured', 'Left', 'own', 'devices', 'control', 'Such', 'are', 'relationships', 'film', 'many', 'teeter', 'brink', 'end', 'due', 'neglect', 'confusion', 'frustration.Lantana', 'tale', 'four', 'marriages', 'beginning', 'love', 'affair', 'can', 'be', 'nurtured', 'back', 'health', 'parties', 'desire', 'are', 'nearly', 'extinguished', 'film', 'serendipity', 'coincidental', 'intertwinings', 'characters', 'yes', 'ala', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'central', 'character', 'Leon', 'Zat', 'played', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'frustrated', 'angry', 'marriage', 'career', 'become', 'meaningless', 'LaPaglia', 'reason', 'gave', 'film', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'performance', 'credible', 'Lawrence', 'neededa', 'central', 'figure', 'chemistry', 'ensemble', 'made', 'need', 'past', 'love', 'dialogue', 'believable', 'LaPaglia', 'workmanlike', 'job', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'nominate', 'good', 'leading', 'role', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'created', 'onscreen', 'heat', 'wife', 'Sonja', 'sensuous', 'talented', 'Kerry', 'Armstrong', 'lover', 'Jane', 'Rachael', 'Blake', 'strong', 'performance', 'partner', 'Claudia', 'Leah', 'Purcell', 'luminous.Leon', 'cop', 'film', 'jolting', 'view', 'hidden', 'body', 'know', 'woman', 'one', 'Later', 'film', 'meet', 'Jane', 'estranged', 'husband', 'neighbors', 'Nik', 'Paula', 'central', 'couple', 'Dr.', 'Somers', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'John', 'Knox', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'psychologist', 'who', 'Sonja', 'grieving', 'John', 'loss', 'murdered', 'daughter', 'Rush', 'Hershey', 'are', 'impeccable', 'couple', 'new', 'comers', 'Vince', 'Colosimo', 'Danielle', 'Farinacci', 'Nik', 'Paula', 'shine', 'film', 'sense', 'love', 'trust', 'betrayal', 'make', 'viewers', 'finally', 'believe', 'married', 'love', 'again.A', 'unique', 'love', 'story', 'wrapped', 'murder', 'mystery', 'Lantana', 'also', 'brief', 'relationships', 'men', 'cast', 'honest', 'thought', 'provoking', 'may', 'evolve', 'too', 'slowly', 'Lantana', 'lush', 'visual', 'portrayal', 'nature', 'married', 'love', 'sense', 'renewal', 'pain.I', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'films', 'Lawrence']",N/A

A woman psychologist hitchhiking at night (after her car breaks down) mysteriously disappears, and her husband immediately becomes the prime suspect.The movie strangely spends most of its time in the first half highlighting the lead detective's extra-marital affair.  Leon (played by Anthony LaPaglia) is overly macho.  But his love interest, Jane, (portrayed by Rachael Blake, a softer and more approachable version of Olivia Newton-John), is extremely enticing, especially as she makes love to him twice; the first time face-up on her bed, and the second time in front of him with her face buried serenely in a pillow.The missing woman, Valerie (Barbara Hershey) is a nicely chested brunette who paradoxically appears to have as many marital problems -- as the people that she counsels.  Incredulously, one of Valerie's gay clients admits to having an affair with a married man; and Valerie becomes convinced that the patient's lover -- is her husband -- and that the man, out of jealously, is planning to secretly bump her off!It wasn't until the end (when Leon is duped into coming clean with his wife -- only to pay the consequences) -- that I finally realized that `Lantana' is not really a murder mystery -- but a moralistic tale of infidelity, where the men are all jerks and suffer accordingly for their improprieties.The movie is extremely well done.

As in &quot;In the Bedroom,&quot; the pathos comes from character not situation: the actor interpreting, ingesting really the core of the character and using the script as a jumping off point; improvising, in a way, his reactions based on the &quot;facts&quot; of the storyline.Anthony LaPaglia is a genuine revelation here.  In his work thus far where/how was he hiding this amazing depth of talent? His Leon Zat is a macho, confused, rabidly sexual, violent yet tender and loving man who finds himself at a crossroads in his middle life: he loves his wife and family, he loves his work but he's thinking of chucking it all to do...what? It's never really resolved and this is all to the good of his character and of the film in general. Nothing in this film is tied up with a ribbon and resolved...for sure or for good.The women in Leon's life, Kerry Armstrong and Rachael Blake turn in strong, nuanced performances with Blake making the stronger impression I think, because of the showier role. Blake's Jane calls to mind women of 1950's melodrama's like Rosalind Russell in &quot;Picnic&quot; : prim and proper, together women out in public; but behind closed doors: heartsick, needy, always with a drink in their hands. Good women, just flawed like the rest of us.Ray Lawrence's &quot;Lantana&quot; is a wise, beautifully acted and well-observed film that demonstrates, once again that it's the connections in life that matter; and that we are always looking for the right one.",5,C O N N E C T I O N S,1008720000,"12 19, 2001",2001,2604,"['year', '2001', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'film', 'history', 'thus', 'far', 'least', 'watershed', 'Year', 'Adult', 'Thriller', 'quot', 'Lantana', 'quot', 'latest', 'example', 'sub-genre', 'Others', 'year', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'Burnt', 'Money', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bedroom', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dinner', 'Rush', 'quot', 'quot', 'L.I.E.', 'quot', 'name', 'Adult', 'Thrillers', 'have', 'one', 'more', 'following', 'common', 'crime', 'usually', 'murder', 'several', 'plot', 'lines', 'mis-connection', 'various', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'connected', 'marriage', 'birth', 'literate', 'scripts', 'involving', 'adult', 'material.', 'quot', 'Lantana', 'quot', 'central', 'character', 'Leon', 'Zat', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'police', 'detective', 'conflicted', 'impending', 'middle', 'age', 'marriage', 'recent', 'affair', 'quot', '2', 'night', 'stand', 'quot', 'Jane', 'Rachael', 'Blake', 'who', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'husband', 'Leon', 'wife', 'Sonja', 'Kerry', 'Armstrong', 'something', 'wrong', 'seeing', 'psychiatrist', 'Valerie', 'Somers', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'who', 'up', 'missing', 'one', 'day', 'movie', 'way', 'witness', 'finest', 'most', 'profound', 'dialogue', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'year', 'quot', 'Bedroom', 'quot', 'pathos', 'character', 'not', 'situation', 'actor', 'interpreting', 'ingesting', 'really', 'core', 'character', 'using', 'script', 'jumping', 'off', 'point', 'improvising', 'way', 'reactions', 'based', 'quot', 'quot', 'storyline.Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'genuine', 'revelation', 'here', 'work', 'thus', 'far', 'where/how', 'was', 'hiding', 'amazing', 'depth', 'talent', 'Leon', 'Zat', 'macho', 'confused', 'rabidly', 'sexual', 'violent', 'yet', 'tender', 'loving', 'man', 'who', 'crossroads', 'middle', 'life', 'wife', 'family', 'work', 'thinking', 'chucking', 'do', 'what', 'never', 'really', 'resolved', 'good', 'character', 'film', 'general', 'Nothing', 'film', 'tied', 'up', 'ribbon', 'resolved', 'sure', 'good.The', 'women', 'Leon', 'life', 'Kerry', 'Armstrong', 'Rachael', 'Blake', 'turn', 'strong', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'Blake', 'making', 'stronger', 'impression', 'think', 'showier', 'role', 'Blake', 'Jane', 'mind', 'women', '1950', 'melodrama', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'quot', 'Picnic', 'quot', 'prim', 'proper', 'together', 'women', 'out', 'public', 'closed', 'doors', 'heartsick', 'needy', 'always', 'drink', 'hands', 'Good', 'women', 'just', 'flawed', 'rest', 'us.Ray', 'Lawrence', 'quot', 'Lantana', 'quot', 'wise', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'well-observed', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'connections', 'life', 'matter', 'are', 'always', 'looking', 'right', 'one']",N/A

Fowler ""ben1283""","[4, 4]","It's a rare event when you go to see a movie having absolutely no idea what it's about and leave the cinema a few hours a few hours later completely amazed by what you just saw.  I went to see this movie with my mother, both of us having little idea what the plot was.  This is probably because 'Lantana' isn't a film that is reliant on story to push it along; it's actually more of a highly astute study of relationships, jealousies, break-ups and love that will completely absorb you.  The fact that the 'story' of the piece (LaPaglia's detective tries to solve the murder of the psychiatrist who treated his wife) is merely a centrepiece for the real action to revolve around speaks marvels for it.In many ways it reminded me of something like 'Short Cuts' or 'Magnolia' (surely something of a compliment in itself), although it would certainly be unfair to say that the director has completely copied the styles of his peers.  Indeed, what we have here are normal people caught up in normal situations that the majority of the audience will certainly be able to empaphise with, apart from the murder itself of course.  There is also an exceptional cast that despite being less starry is at least a rival for the supporting casts helmed by Altman and Anderson's films.  As previous reviews have mentioned, it would be completely unfair to pinpoint one performance from a list of so many perfect ones.The director should also be applauded for making a movie that is not only distinctly adult but will hopefully create a new wave of movies that aren't afraid to challenge their audience's expectations.  Indeed, the ending can't really be labelled as redemptive, with only a handful of the characters getting what they desire at the end, and this being only after the torture that the script weaves around them.  I can say without a shadow of a doubt that 'Lantana' is the best film to come out all year and is unlikely to be rivalled.

694484,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B0000639HN,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[1, 1]","Australian Director Ray Lawrence&#8217;s second movie and his first for 17 years is an articulate, intelligent and totally compelling examination of human relationships, as well as a thought provoking thriller. Award winning and critically acclaimed, this is the type of movie that Oscar should be honouring, instead of the commercial Hollywood formulaic mediocrity the Academy often seems to prefer.Lantana opens with camera panning down through a tangle of shrubs to reveal the dead body of a woman, stockings ripped and one shoe missing. Immediately drawn to this image we are led to wonder who the dead woman is and to wonder how she died and who killed her but rather than this being merely a thriller it is also a highly intelligent and very rewarding examination of troubled marriage. The title &#8216;Lantana&#8217; perhaps doesn&#8217;t translate well to most countries outside of Australia. It is never explained during the movie, which is a bit of a shame, because Lantana (the name of the tropical shrub which surrounds the deceased) is used as a metaphor for the web of tangled relationships portrayed throughout this film.At the centre of the plot is Leon Zat (Anthony LaPaglia), a burnt-out forty something Sydney police detective. Over-weight and troubled by chest pains, he is conducting an affair with a woman by the name of Jane O&#8217;May (Rachael Blake), who is separated from her husband. Meanwhile, unbeknown to Leon, his unhappy wife, Sonja (Kerry Armstrong) is seeing a therapist, Valerie (Barbara Hershey) about their troubled marriage. However, Valerie&#8217;s own marriage is also in crisis: Following the death of her 11-year-old daughter her husband (Geoffrey Rush) no longer engages in sexual relations and appears to deliberately avoid spending time with her, whilst often &#8220;working late at the office&#8221;. Leading Valerie to suspect her husband of a homosexual affair with one of her clients, Michael, who appears to be baiting her.A third couple are also central to the plot and become embroiled in the tangled web; unemployed Nik (Vince Colosimo) and his wife (Keira Wingate) live with their kids next door to Leon&#8217;s mistress, Jane. Nik is friendly with Jane&#8217;s estranged husband, Pete (Glen Robbins) but overlooks Jane&#8217;s &#8216;affair&#8217;, on the advice of his wife, when he spots Leon leaving his mates house. Meanwhile two other relationships between gay Michael and his married lover and Leon&#8217;s police partner and a mystery stranger also play out in this beautifully judged, thoughtful and well-written movie, adapted by Andrew Bovell from his original stage play, Speaking in Tongues.Not only is &#8216;Lantana&#8217; well-written and well-directed but it has depth. At its core are the central themes of trust, grief, fidelity, betrayal and redemption. Anthony LaPaglia (The Client, So I Married An Axe Murderer), Geoffrey Rush, Barbara Hershey and Kerry Armstrong all give great performances, subtly conveying a broad range of emotions throughout the course of the movie. In particular, LaPaglia, an Australian perhaps best known for his TV appearances (Murder One, Frasier, Without A Trace) and whom I previously assumed was Italian-American, is superb as Leon and it is his uncompromising performance that is at the core of this excellent film.Ray Lawrence, an Aussie TV commercials director must take enormous credit too for the pace and balance of the movie, as well as the performances, which are all pitch-perfect. Lantana is at once a psychological thriller/drama, an essay in love, and an intelligent examination of human relationships, marriage and fidelity. After making this little gem of a movie, let&#8217;s just hope that Ray Lawrence doesn&#8217;t wait another 17 years before making his next one.Totally compelling, Lantana kept me hooked throughout every moment of its two-hour minute running time.

But the real ""mystery"" may be about something else.In general, the movie has good performances, and the observant movie viewer may recognize more than one level is going on and be struck by the emotions and psychology of characters (especially of distrust and deception especially in relationships).The problem is that there are better examples of this type of movie (""Grand Canyon,"" ""Short Cuts,"" and ""Happiness"" immediately come to mind).  This movie also works on particular coincidences between characters which are probably a bit more annoying than enriching.  The other movies I mention do not have that problem.But the main problem of this movie is that it is told too linear and the result is more like an episodic melodrama, and this movie obviously was trying to be more.  It should've been more bold and remembered to cross the genre of a ""mystery"" which it is supposed to be doing.  It needed to start ""in media res,"" in the middle of things, with the truly striking moment, which is right BEFORE the woman disappears.  By telling it linearly, it's an episodic melodrama, and reminds me more of many bad 70's movies, though with better acting and definitely a movie with more substance.  Sometimes linear storytelling is not the right ""order"" for the story and the way it builds up.",3,"Decent Melodrama, Not a Classic Mystery",1013990400,"02 18, 2002",2002,1482,"['Lantana', 'collage', 'number', 'people', 'lives', 'similar', 'movies', 'such', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'who', 'come', 'together', 'when', 'woman', 'murder', 'may', 'be', 'involved', 'real', 'mystery', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'else.In', 'general', 'movie', 'good', 'performances', 'observant', 'movie', 'viewer', 'may', 'recognize', 'more', 'one', 'level', 'going', 'be', 'struck', 'emotions', 'psychology', 'characters', 'especially', 'distrust', 'deception', 'especially', 'relationships', '.The', 'problem', 'are', 'better', 'examples', 'type', 'movie', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'Happiness', 'immediately', 'come', 'mind', 'movie', 'also', 'particular', 'coincidences', 'characters', 'are', 'probably', 'bit', 'more', 'annoying', 'enriching', 'other', 'movies', 'mention', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'problem.But', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'told', 'too', 'linear', 'result', 'more', 'episodic', 'melodrama', 'movie', 'obviously', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'more', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'bold', 'remembered', 'cross', 'genre', 'mystery', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'needed', 'start', 'media', 'res', 'middle', 'things', 'truly', 'striking', 'moment', 'right', 'woman', 'telling', 'linearly', 'episodic', 'melodrama', 'more', 'many', 'bad', '70', 'movies', 'better', 'acting', 'definitely', 'movie', 'more', 'substance', 'Sometimes', 'linear', 'storytelling', 'not', 'right', 'order', 'story', 'way', 'up']",N/A

Story revolves around four different couples at various stages in their marriage.  It is a mistery as to what binds these people in their marriages.  They are togehter but yet we keep wondering why or perhaps for how much longer.  Since love cannot hold marriage alone, what are the other attributes that keep these individuals together: grief, loyalty, children, habit? Life with all its brutality can affect our relationships, especially the ones with people closest to us.  No one can say that they do not feel numb at one point of their life.  What does it take to bring back the emotions: trauma, loss, regret?  This is emotionally fulfilling movie.  The only reason it got only 4 our of 5 stars is that part with latin dancing is dragging it all into unnecessary direction.

694490,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B0000639HN,Reviewer,"[26, 27]","One of the defining characteristics of the human condition is the inevitability of change, both physically and emotionally.  Though most would deny it, one is not the same person at forty years of age that they were at twenty; the emotional growth one undergoes over a period of time dictates that it cannot be so.  Unlike the changes one experiences during puberty and adolescence, however, that emotional growth is unceasing.  It may be said, in fact, that ""change"" within that context is the only real constant in life; and the effects of this perpetual state of flux on any particular individual is determined by that individual's experiences and derived from a personal frame of reference.  And the challenge of coping with the changes in our own lives forms a common thread that binds us together as a species, and it is those challenges and the ways in which we respond to them that forms the basis for director Ray Lawrence's affecting drama, ""Lantana,"" in which he explores the disparate ways that individuals, dissimilar and yet the same, strive to deal with this thing we call ""Life.""Police officer Leon Zat (Anthony LaPaglia) is at a crossroads in his life.  In the parlance of Pink Floyd, he has grown numb, though not ""comfortably.""  He has a wife, Sonja (Kerry Armstrong) and two children, and though he loves Sonja, this ""numbness"" that has left him devoid of feeling has driven him to an affair with Jane O'May (Rachael Blake), who has recently separated from her husband, Pete (Glenn Robbins).  Unlike Leon, however, Jane admittedly no longer loves her husband, and has no intention of taking him back.  Sonja, meanwhile, affected by the emotional distance Leon has put between them, is seeing a therapist, Dr. Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey), who is currently coping with the emotional estrangement of her own husband, John (Geoffrey Rush), a chasm born of personal circumstances which neither seems capable of bridging.  The only happy couple in town, apparently, is Jane's neighbors, Nik and Paula Daniels (Vince Colosimo, Daniella Farinacci).  But as Nik is out of work, that, too may soon change.Different people, from different walks of life, each in their own way undergoing that change that is so inevitable.  But when one of those involved in the drama suddenly disappears one night, and another is subsequently implicated, it precipitates the intersection of the lives of all four couples, in a way that will ultimately effect a drastic change for some, and resolution for the others.Utilizing his remarkable ensemble cast to great effect, director Lawrence achieves success with this film through a studied and sensitive presentation of the material contained in the insightful screenplay by Andrew Bovell, which he adapted from his own play, ""Speaking In Tongues.""  Very gradually, Lawrence carefully establishes the characters and their particular situations with an objective eye that refuses to allow a rush to judgment with regards to any and all of those involved here, even as he takes the drama to the heights of emotional involvement.  There is a natural rhythm and flow to his presentation, with an emphasis on the human aspects of the story, that enables the audience to make that vital connection with the characters as their story unfolds.  Lawrence succinctly peals away that protective outer shell of his characters and digs deep, exposing and laying bare their innermost thoughts and desires, ultimately achieving the result of giving everyone in the audience someone or something with which to identify and relate.  He puts it all on a very personal level; and it's a demonstration of filmmaking at it's best.Lawrence also exacts some extraordinary performances from his actors, beginning with LaPaglia, who does some of the best work of his career with his portrayal of Leon.  LaPaglia explores Leon from the inside out, and most importantly, manages to convey his findings to his audience.  While some actors in similar situations have a tendency to remain ambiguous, LaPaglia makes Leon's growth and development entirely discernible.  Unexpectedly, in fact, it is Leon in whom the emotional pinnacle of the film is realized, attained through a memorable performance by LaPaglia.Extremely effective, as well, is Geoffrey Rush, who turns in a performance that is so subtle it fairly crackles with understated emotion.  Some of the most affecting moments of the film, in fact, are those in which John and Valerie strive to reconnect and put their marriage aright.  And Hershey is terrific, too, with her portrayal of this woman who is so fragile and vulnerable beneath her requisite mask of professional strength and authority.It is in Sonja, however, that we see most clearly the inner turmoil that, in the final analysis, is shared by all of the characters in the film, albeit in accordance with their own, individual situations.  But as portrayed by Kerry Armstrong, we get, especially, that sense of the common challenge of coping with the changes life throws at us seemingly at random.  It's a notable performance, entirely convincing, and it adds greatly to the overall credibility of the film.Also noteworthy are the performances of Colosimo, Blake, and especially Farinacci, whose winning portrayal makes Paula the most empathetic of all the characters in the film.The supporting cast includes Russell Dykstra (Michael), Peter Phelps (Patrick), Leah Purcell (Claudia), Nicholas Cooper (Sam) and Marc Dyer (Dylan).  A film that works as entertainment, but even more by way of enlightenment, ""Lantana"" is engrossing, engaging cinema that will make you think and reflect about the changes you've encountered and will encounter in your own life; an inspired film that reaches out and touches the humanity that resides within all of us, that mirror being held up that affords us a good look at ourselves and allows us to decide whether or not we like what we see.  And if we don't, perhaps this film will become the catalyst that makes us do something about it.  And that's the magic of the movies.",5,"Subtle, Affecting Drama",1025913600,"07 6, 2002",2002,6048,"['One', 'defining', 'characteristics', 'human', 'condition', 'inevitability', 'change',

Could they be betraying you about their sexual orientation?  Could they kill someone and not tell you?  If they denied any of the above, would you believe them unequivocally?  What about your friends, say, your best friend...could he or she have an affair with your partner?  And everything you say in the sanctity of a professional relationship with your psychiatrist, surely you can trust in confidentiality here? Can you trust your own body?  Your own self?*Questions like these arise naturally on seeing this brilliant film.  Make sure you see it with a friend, or a group of friends, better still a few enemies too, because you'll want to talk about it afterwards, and the discussion is likely to be as interesting as the film itself.*Trust is central, and it is explored in a myriad of nuanced relationships and situations.  The husband and wife relationship is viewed in several forms, but trust is also tested between parents and children, work colleagues, even between the audience and the film itself - our expectations are, after all, constantly being played with, and if you expect a conventional thriller, as the opening shots might promise, then you will be disappointed.  If you expect psychological depth and highly crafted film-making, then you're in for a treat.*This film looks and sounds great.  If somehow you manage to stop yourself thinking about the characters (and judging them (and then revising those judgements)), you can wallow in the moody art direction, editing, and score.*The actors are all brilliant and, given that in most cases they are better here than elsewhere, the director, Ray Lawrence, deserves much of the credit.  Kerry Armstrong, in particular, is just superb.  Even the more opaque and less likable characters demand the audience's attention, and reward further dissection - Geoffrey Rush and Barbara Hershey won't allow us an easy view of their secrets, but then they are no easier on each other, possibly no easier even when facing a mirror.*Go see this.  It just might be the best Australian film ever made.  In terms of psychological interest and depth the only comparison I can think of is with Bergman - in terms of sheer cleverness and playing with our expectations of the medium, Hitchcock.

THree of them are in a serious crisis - infidelity, splitting up, grief - and are pondering the meaning of it all while groping towards reconciliation or compromise or perhaps divorce.  The tone is unrelentingly sad, making it an agony to watch, particularly if you have felt pain and alienation in a marriage that once worked.While the investigation side serves as a kind of plot device, it has barely begun by the middle of the film.  Instead, the viewer gets a picture of each marriage, vividly and concisely portrayed like a series of vignettes, and the acting is positively excellent.  For example, Barbara Hershey exudes a disturbing, if functional, depression as she attempts to treat some pretty troubled patients - it is a wonderful portrayal of emotional ricochet, where their issues get her to reflect deeply on her own life.  Hershey has never been better.  Though brief, each view is utterly convincing, indeed rivetting in the way a poem can have an emotional impact in an entirely different way from a novel.  It is very successful art.I recommend this film as a valuable exploration of couples in mid life.  Very good, realistic drama, including the investigation.

Lantana is an aggressive weed shrub that grows in Australia and its prickly vines smother any other bushes around it. It looks beautiful from the outside (as shown in the opening shots of the movie) but is noxious under its dense cover. What a fitting metaphor for almost every character in the movie, people who seem deceptively normal on the surface but have troubling nuances behind their everyday facades.Veering around the emotional crossroads of a mid-age cop (Anthonly Lapaglia) and his confusions over a minor infidelity with a woman in his Salsa class, the movie covers the intertwined lives of a few couples. Amidst this very realistic chronicle of relationships in our modern condition, a woman is murdered (or is she?). We are led into the mystery as subtly as we are led out of it.This richly layered narrative feels of a texture akin to ""The Insider"" and is carried almost entirely by the super smooth direction. Supported almost perfectly by Kelley's haunting soundtrack (e.g., the guitar chords on ""Whats happening to us"" or the stirring ""Te Busco"" by Celia Cruz).If you don't mind a mildly fairy-tale denouement where several circles fit snugly into several squares, this is a wholesome treat you should definitely try to watch if you can.",5,A MUST-WATCH GEM,1056499200,"06 25, 2003",2003,1282,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'name', 'Lantana', 'aggressive', 'weed', 'shrub', 'Australia', 'prickly', 'vines', 'smother', 'other', 'bushes', 'beautiful', 'outside', 'shown', 'opening', 'shots', 'movie', 'noxious', 'dense', 'cover', 'What', 'fitting', 'metaphor', 'almost', 'character', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'deceptively', 'normal', 'surface', 'have', 'troubling', 'nuances', 'everyday', 'facades.Veering', 'emotional', 'crossroads', 'mid-age', 'cop', 'Anthonly', 'Lapaglia', 'confusions', 'minor', 'infidelity', 'woman', 'Salsa', 'class', 'movie', 'intertwined', 'lives', 'few', 'couples', 'Amidst', 'very', 'realistic', 'chronicle', 'relationships', 'modern', 'condition', 'woman', 'murdered', 'are', 'led', 'mystery', 'as', 'subtly', 'are', 'led', 'it.This', 'richly', 'layered', 'narrative', 'feels', 'texture', 'akin', 'Insider', 'carried', 'almost', 'entirely', 'super', 'smooth', 'direction', 'Supported', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'Kelley', 'haunting', 'soundtrack', 'e.g.', 'guitar', 'chords', 'Whats', 'happening', 'stirring', 'Te', 'Busco', 'Celia', 'Cruz', '.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'mildly', 'fairy-tale', 'denouement', 'where', 'several', 'circles', 'fit', 'snugly', 'several', 'squares', 'wholesome', 'treat', 'should', 'definitely', 'try', 'watch', 'can']",N/A

What is, in retrospect, a very complicated plot is rendered simple and compelling by the strength of Bovell's writing and the understated performances of a stellar cast. And unlike so many adapted plays, this isn't wordy or limited in its scope. It's thematically grand, yet domestically real - and for that reason totally convincing. There isn't a false note in this film, not anywhere. It's something of a coming-of-age for Australian cinema, too. It doesn't debase itself in pursuit of an American audience, nor remain so precious as to appeal only to Australians. Here at last we have a serious, intelligent, realist film of international calibre which doesn't have to trade on the uniqueness of Australian life or humour.

It adopts a bit of American Beauty mood at the start, but when the film moves on, its own character and style comes out beautifully. The major characters are two cops, the wife of one of the cops, their kids, a guy looking for a job, his wife and his kids, a psychiatrist, her husband, a separated woman, her husband, and a gay patron of the psychiatrist. They all have their very unique characters and ways of handling things. Throughout the whole film, you can feel the emotions and turns of every single character. It is one of the best acted Australian film in the recent years. The mood is heavy but you will really care for how their relationships would evolve and develope at the end. The only discount to the movie is the last bit after the whole story ended, there is a dancing scene which was there for the soundtrack to be finished (or otherwise), which is a bit too much for the whole movie.

694500,A3N110LGDXE6FH,B0000639HN,Veronica,"[2, 2]","I simply cannot praise Lantana highly enough.  I have watched it many times over the past few years and never get tired of it. It is beautifully filmed and raises loads of interesting questions.The plot is based around the interconnected lives of four married Australian couples. As the film progresses, the disappearance of a key character also opens up a murder mystery angle, which is played to perfection. The film explores what holds long-term relationships together and what pulls them apart. It puts the spotlight on love and trust and why people lose their way. All of the actors in the film really work well together and the couples seem to have a special chemistry between them so you don't doubt they would have ended up with each other. Anthony Lapaglia is particularly good as Leon, the cop who is having an affair almost without consciously having made a choice to cheat on his wife. The actors playing Paula and Nik also really stand out and their scenes together are very believable. Barbara Hershley is also brilliant as Valerie, a pyschiatrist who is struggling to deal with her own terrible pain.Lantana has so many memorable and surprising scenes. To name a few - Leon running smack-bang into another jogger; Paula returning home to find Jane has tidied her house; Valerie falsely accusing a man of saying something to her in the street; Claudia watching a man she secretly admires slip out of her grasp yet again. The great thing is, all these scenes seem true to life. Director Ray Lawrence seems to know exactly how to get the most from each situation, and allows his actors to look natural on film, with lined faces, dark circles under their eyes etc.Finally, I can't write a review of Lantana without mentioning the screenplay. It is so brilliant that I bought a copy to read purely for fun last year. Andrew Bovell is a really gifted writer and he conveys so much emotion with the simplest dialogue and actions.For me, this film scores 10/10 as a psycholocial thriller, whodunnit and family drama. The ending is shocking and sad and heartening all at the same time. The final shot is simply beautiful and takes my breath away.

The cast includes Geoffrey Rush (Shine), Kerry Armstrong (SeaChange), Anthony LaPallagia (The Bank) and America's Barbara Hershey (Beaches).

There are some important peripheral characters as well. The husband of the main couple is a detective going through a mid-life crisis (Anthony LaPaglia). His wife (Kerry Armstrong) knows something's wrong and is getting counseling. The marriage of the counselor (Barbara Hershey) is also troubled due to the death of their young daughter a couple of years earlier. The woman the detective is having a fling with (Rachael Blake) thinks her neighbor (Vince Colosimo) may be involved in the counselor's mysterious disappearance. This is odd because the suspect's marriage is, ironically, the only solid relationship in the story. The counselor's husband is also a suspect (Geoffrey Rush) and has insightful things to share about marriage with the brooding detective.The reason the film's called ""Lantana"" is because lantana is a tangled shrub common in Australia, which represents the entanglements of the lives of the characters. It also symbolizes marriage since lantana has a sweet but bitter smell; it's beautiful with its flowers, but has ""stings""; its branches weave together in a complicated way and in the story a woman is caught in the complexity of it.""Lantana"" is the antithesis of big, dumb, effects-laden ""blockbusters,"" which -- oddly enough -- often become boring with their overload of ""exciting"" things going on. ""Lantana"" effectively shows that ordinary life is more interesting and compelling, if done right. Human nature is explored through a blend of passionate emotions, misconceptions, betrayals, anger, premature conclusions, vanity, duty, ethics, honesty, loyalty and repentance.Two of my all-time favorite dramas are ""Grand Canyon"" and ""Snow Angels (Widescreen Edition)"".
