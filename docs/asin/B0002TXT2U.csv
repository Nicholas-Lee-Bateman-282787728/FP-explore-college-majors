845275,APS1QYAETXXR7,B0002TXT2U,"An Opera Goer ""Al""","[46, 46]","Super friendly? Yes, toward Danilo that is. She is totally ready (and even look forward to) to reunite with him. She is very playful, no sign of hostility, and letting him in every step of the way. All she wanted was to hear the L word from him (and finally got it at the end of the operetta). This is not a bad thing, and is rather refreshing. Though it is not quite the same widow as portrayed elsewhere. Other than this, this production is in so many ways differ from those we saw in the U.S. This is not a glamorous widow. She was dressed in ordinary clothing, in all three acts. And of course, the famous Merry Widow hat was also out. The biggest difference is in Act II. In that no body wore a native costume. There is no garden in the widow's estate. The pavilion is not obvious; in fact there is only an entrance door at the very end on one side of the stage (without the building). One might consider these drawbacks but all the stage activities and good music would divert one's attention and not knowing what was missing.About the singers: Dagmar Schellenberger as the widow, an apt singing actress everybody dear to love. There were complaints about the age of the widow in the San Francisco 2001 production and yearn for a younger one; this is the one for you. Rodney Gilfry as Count Danilo, the Los Angeles native has been doing this role for more than one hundred times in the big houses all over Europe and America. I was in the audience both times when he was singing the same role twice in Los Angeles. And Ute Gfrerer as Valencienne, another singing actress educated in Los Angeles, in addition to her superb singing and acting she dances too. Her performance of the Can-Can in Act III was just absolutely stunning. Overall, this is a very well put together production. I have seen many versions of this operetta, on video (VHS or DVD), on stage or view it from the PBS. With all things considered this video is quite exceptional. If there were a problem that would be in the finished disc as its subtitles are often incomplete. In a string of spoken (or singing) dialog (all in German), there was only a partial of the translations were shown on screen. For instance, when Hanna said if she were remarry she would lose all her fortune. The subtitle would only show the first part and left out the second part. This kind of problem persists through out the entire disc.",5,A Very Lively and Super Friendly Widow,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2388,"['Super', 'friendly', 'Yes', 'Danilo', 'totally', 'ready', 'even', 'look', 'forward', 'reunite', 'very', 'playful', 'sign', 'hostility', 'letting', 'step', 'way', 'wanted', 'was', 'hear', 'L', 'word', 'finally', 'got', 'end', 'operetta', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'rather', 'refreshing', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'widow', 'portrayed', 'elsewhere', 'Other', 'production', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'differ', 'saw', 'U.S', 'not', 'glamorous', 'widow', 'was', 'dressed', 'ordinary', 'clothing', 'three', 'acts', 'course', 'famous', 'Merry', 'Widow', 'hat', 'was', 'also', 'out', 'biggest', 'difference', 'Act', 'II', 'body', 'wore', 'native', 'costume', 'garden', 'widow', 'estate', 'pavilion', 'not', 'obvious', 'fact', 'only', 'entrance', 'door', 'very', 'end', 'one', 'side', 'stage', 'building', 'One', 'might', 'consider', 'drawbacks', 'stage', 'activities', 'good', 'music', 'would', 'divert', 'one', 'attention', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'missing.About', 'singers', 'Dagmar', 'Schellenberger', 'widow', 'apt', 'singing', 'actress', 'everybody', 'dear', 'love', 'were', 'complaints', 'age', 'widow', 'San', 'Francisco', '2001', 'production', 'yearn', 'younger', 'one', 'one', 'Rodney', 'Gilfry', 'Count', 'Danilo', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'native', 'been', 'doing', 'role', 'more', 'one', 'hundred', 'times', 'big', 'houses', 'Europe', 'America', 'was', 'audience', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'singing', 'same', 'role', 'twice', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Ute', 'Gfrerer', 'Valencienne', 'singing', 'actress', 'educated', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'addition', 'superb', 'singing', 'acting', 'too', 'performance', 'Can-Can', 'Act', 'III', 'was', 'just', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Overall', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'production', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'versions', 'operetta', 'video', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'stage', 'view', 'PBS', 'things', 'considered', 'video', 'quite', 'exceptional', 'were', 'problem', 'would', 'be', 'finished', 'disc', 'subtitles', 'are', 'often', 'incomplete', 'string', 'spoken', 'singing', 'dialog', 'German', 'was', 'only', 'partial', 'translations', 'were', 'shown', 'screen', 'instance', 'when', 'Hanna', 'said', 'were', 'remarry', 'would', 'lose', 'fortune', 'subtitle', 'would', 'only', 'show', 'first', 'part', 'left', 'out', 'second', 'part', 'kind', 'problem', 'persists', 'entire', 'disc']",Lehar: Die lustige Witwe
845276,A3BOV1DPAWNR9M,B0002TXT2U,"Bob Epstein ""bepstein9""","[5, 5]","Decidedly in the top handful of operettas, Die Lustige Witwe receives an exemplary performance in Zurich. The cast is having fun in this one. The main characters look the parts, there's not a weak voice among them and Franz Welser-Most conducts with zip and style. Costumes are excellent and the staging is convincing if a bit modest in the first two acts. Act 3 at Hanna's version of Maxim's in Paris, is pulled off with real panache - if you don't respond to the spine-tingling enthusiasm of the dances, check your heartbeat.Dagmar Schellenberger is a most fetching Hanna. She may not have the biggest voice but it is warm and her stage presence is compelling. She is really enjoying herself. Rodney Gilfrey certainly has the look and voice of a fine Danilo. His acting, however, is pretty wooden, although he does rise to the occasion when love is in the air. The camera has a difficult time not focusing on the striking Valencienne of Ute Gfrerer (I'm guessing the camera operators are all men). She can sing too, and wow, can she dance! Piotr Beczala brings his honeyed tenor to Camille.Of the few drawbacks, I don't respond nearly as much as the audience in Zurich to the Germanic, Swiss or whatever humor of Herbert Prikopa's non-singing Njegus. But wait until the end and he has some fine shtick. More disturbingly, the English subtitles are not good. They are frequently a line or two behind the singers, so while the audience is laughing the home viewer is wondering what is so funny. This should have been fixed. Also, they should have been more complete. Sloppy work.Still, this is a most winning performance, a decided upgrade over the San Francisco production on Opus Arte. That does have fabulous are deco costumes, a commanding Danilo in Bo Skovhus and a thoroughly charming Valencienne in Angelika Kirchschlager. But Yvonne Kenney's Widow is too old, she plays too much to the gallery and her voice is straining as the performance goes on. She is admittedly, never less than good. Her acting and her stage presence do make up for these shortcomings to a good extent.Plus the Act 3 dances are tired next to Zurich. Most distressingly, there are no English subtitles (only Spanish ones!). No excuse for that; one can certainly understand the frequent Wendy Wasserstein rewritten dialogue (which does start to wear on one in its increasingly cloying cuteness), but understanding the singing in difficult. No excuse for that.Stick with Zurich.",5,Fabulous in Zurich,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,2456,"['Decidedly', 'top', 'handful', 'operettas', 'Die', 'Lustige', 'Witwe', 'exemplary', 'performance', 'Zurich', 'cast', 'having', 'fun', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'look', 'parts', 'not', 'weak', 'voice', 'Franz', 'Welser-Most', 'conducts', 'zip', 'style', 'Costumes', 'are', 'excellent', 'staging', 'convincing', 'bit', 'modest', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'Act', '3', 'Hanna', 'version', 'Maxim', 'Paris', 'pulled', 'off', 'real', 'panache', 'do', ""n't"", 'respond', 'spine-tingling', 'enthusiasm', 'dances', 'check', 'heartbeat.Dagmar', 'Schellenberger', 'most', 'fetching', 'Hanna', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'biggest', 'voice', 'warm', 'stage', 'presence', 'compelling', 'really', 'enjoying', 'Rodney', 'Gilfrey', 'certainly', 'look', 'voice', 'fine', 'Danilo', 'acting', 'however', 'pretty', 'wooden', 'rise', 'occasion', 'when', 'love', 'air', 'camera', 'difficult', 'time', 'not', 'focusing', 'striking', 'Valencienne', 'Ute', 'Gfrerer', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'camera', 'operators', 'are', 'men', 'can', 'sing', 'too', 'wow', 'can', 'dance', 'Piotr', 'Beczala', 'honeyed', 'tenor', 'Camille.Of', 'few', 'drawbacks', 'do', ""n't"", 'respond', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'audience', 'Zurich', 'Germanic', 'Swiss', 'humor', 'Herbert', 'Prikopa', 'non-singing', 'Njegus', 'wait', 'end', 'fine', 'shtick', 'More', 'disturbingly', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'are', 'frequently', 'line', 'two', 'singers', 'so', 'audience', 'laughing', 'home', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'what', 'so', 'funny', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fixed', 'Also', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'complete', 'Sloppy', 'work.Still', 'most', 'winning', 'performance', 'decided', 'upgrade', 'San', 'Francisco', 'production', 'Opus', 'Arte', 'have', 'fabulous', 'are', 'deco', 'costumes', 'commanding', 'Danilo', 'Bo', 'Skovhus', 'thoroughly', 'charming', 'Valencienne', 'Angelika', 'Kirchschlager', 'Yvonne', 'Kenney', 'Widow', 'too', 'old', 'too', 'much', 'gallery', 'voice', 'straining', 'performance', 'admittedly', 'never', 'less', 'good', 'acting', 'stage', 'presence', 'do', 'make', 'up', 'shortcomings', 'good', 'extent.Plus', 'Act', '3', 'dances', 'are', 'tired', 'next', 'Zurich', 'Most', 'distressingly', 'are', 'English', 'subtitles', 'only', 'Spanish', 'ones', 'No', 'excuse', 'one', 'can', 'certainly', 'understand', 'frequent', 'Wendy', 'Wasserstein', 'dialogue', 'start', 'wear', 'one', 'increasingly', 'cloying', 'cuteness', 'understanding', 'singing', 'difficult', 'excuse', 'that.Stick', 'Zurich']",Lehar: Die lustige Witwe

I wish I had been able to see it live.  It is hard to identify a stand-out role since everyone did a great job.  There is clear chemistry between Schellenberger and Gilfry.  I found the comic intepretation of Njegus by Herbert Prikopa to be excellent and despite this being a non singing role, he became pivotal in plot evolution.  The make-up, costumes, and acting hold up to the near constant close ups.  Some of the group scenes were distorted because of the tendency toward close-up than group shots.  This was particularly true with some of the dance scenes.  However, this is a minor criticism.  On my 55 inch, edge lit LCD, the images were clear; the color solid.

845279,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B0002TXT2U,I. Giles,"[9, 9]","This recording of The Merry Widow, recorded in 2004 at the Zurich opera, to my mind has it all and must therefore lead the field and by a considerable amount. I say this having previously owned, and replaced the much praised version by Yvonne Kenny at San Francisco. More about that in the course of this review.The current production is essentially a traditional one and is sung in the original German with subtitles provided for non-German viewers. This is a great advantage as, like most operas, there is a flow and pacing as well as the actual sound of an original language which simply works better than any translation. Apart from that, the exact words being sung, even in translation, are often hard to distinguish as they are sung therefore subtitles can often be of use even for native viewers. In the case of the San Francisco performance, the enunciation of the words is frequently difficult to follow and there are no subtitles to help so this version in German is actually easier to follow.The cast are uniformly excellent and features many absolutely stand-out contributions. Not least is the non-singing role of Njegus. This is wonderfully performed by Herbert Prikopa who shows an instinctive awareness of comedic timing and is able to make the amusing script a very funny on-going event. This consequently has an enormous linking role and adds pace to the whole production. In the San Francisco production the comedy in the spoken script is far too laboured and is not in the same class of entertainment. The supporting male roles of competing suitors and husbands are all well delivered and maintain the same degree of pace throughout. Piotr Beczala in particular is able to make the most of his tenor voice and manages the technical challenges of the higher parts of the range without any sense of vocal stress.The key supporting female role of Valencienne performed by Ute Gfrerer is another stand-out role as she is a very attractive woman of a suitably young age with plenty of energy as appropriate to her role. She has a most attractive voice and is this respect is well able to balance Dagmar Schellenberger on the several occasions when they sing together throughout the opera. Vocally she is more than able to deliver on the more extended vocal challenges of the range with unforced tone. She is also a very able dancer when taking a leading role `et moi' in the extended Act 3 dance sequence at Maxims.In turning attention to the two key roles of Danilo, played by Rodney Gilfry, and Hanna (the Merry Widow), played by Dagmar Schellenberger, we are met by two performances of such skill that one almost forgets that we are watching an entertainment as opposed to real events. The relationship between these two is electrifyingly believable and underlines the quality of the libretto which so accurately reflects the emotional interaction between the two characters as they jostle for position as their relationship re-ignites. Both Dagmar and Gilfry are of the correct age and personal attractiveness to make this entire scenario totally dramatically acceptable. They are both fine actors as well as outstandingly good singers. In addition, Rodney Gilfry's delivery of the German dialogue has a fluency to match Dagmar's own natural home language and, coupled with his own evident enjoyment in the role, makes for greatly enhanced entertainment value.All of this points up a fundamental flaw in the alternative San Francisco production where I personally find Yvonne Kenny a major problem. Her voice is no longer quite up to the part with quite a lot of the vibrato of the sort that one can associate with age. Far more worrying however, is the lack of communication between her and those she is singing or talking to. She focusses on delivering to the audience instead and this destroys the intended relationship that is supposed to exist between herself and Danilo and which is so obviously evident in this Zurich production.The whole production sizzles under the expert conducting of Franz Welser-Most who also brings out sparking playing from the fine Zurich orchestra. The dancers and whole operatic company all produce fully involving support for the main roles.Finally, one must mention the actual recording quality at Zurich. This has camera work that draws the viewer in and totally involves the viewer in the unfolding stage events. The imaging is crisp, of sharp definition and of good tonal range. The sound is excellent and is presented in DTS 5.1, DD 5.1 and stereo options. This may not be a Blu-ray disc as yet but in no way is it inferior to the San Francisco option.In summary therefore the choice is clear. This Zurich production, and especially the resultant performance, is in a class of its own. I have now enjoyed this disc several times with increasing pleasure on every occasion and can fully endorse the enthusiasm of the audience present at the time of the recording. This is an outstanding disc and should give most purchasers enormous and continuing satisfaction over many years. There are no reservations to be made in my opinion and I would unhesitatingly suggest that this is a clear 5 star winning disc.............................................Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one.
