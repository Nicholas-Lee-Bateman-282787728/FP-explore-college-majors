1553858,A24PTVSZSM8968,B008IG0D00,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","This is a somewhat typical TV movie about a holiday romance. It's fairly low budget and does involve some cheesy acting and scenes here and there. However, in spite of a rocky start, this one ends up being pretty likable in the end. It is the story of a nice girl who works for an incredibly selfish, overbearing and abusive boss. At the beginning of the movie, she is dressed up in costume to go to a party. In a strange turn of events, she is in an elevator with a handsome rich guy. When the elevator malfunctions, they end up kissing without knowing who they are and then go their separate ways. It turns out the guy is her boss' finacee, but he doesn't end up recognizing her in her everyday attire. Over the course of the movie, she ends up being forced to work at his house because she and her boss have agree to decorate for the holidays. Inevitably, they bond and he remembers the kiss in the elevator without knowing the identity of the girl. Without spoiling the ending, suffice it to say that it is similar to many other movies like this. There are a few scenes here and there in the move that are a bit implausible and the girl's boss is so horrific, she is almost not believable. Other than that, it is a well-done low-budget film. There is a ton of chemistry between the main characters and you find yourself really hoping they end up together. If you watch this more as a loose retelling of the Cinderella tale rather than a realistic real-life story, it works. I would recommend this is you like clean feel-good Christmas stories.",5,A lot of spark in the end,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,1547,"['somewhat', 'typical', 'TV', 'movie', 'holiday', 'romance', 'fairly', 'low', 'budget', 'involve', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'scenes', 'here', 'there', 'However', 'spite', 'rocky', 'start', 'one', 'up', 'being', 'pretty', 'likable', 'end', 'story', 'nice', 'girl', 'who', 'incredibly', 'selfish', 'overbearing', 'abusive', 'boss', 'beginning', 'movie', 'dressed', 'up', 'costume', 'go', 'party', 'strange', 'turn', 'events', 'elevator', 'handsome', 'rich', 'guy', 'When', 'elevator', 'malfunctions', 'end', 'up', 'kissing', 'knowing', 'who', 'are', 'then', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'out', 'guy', 'boss', 'finacee', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'recognizing', 'everyday', 'attire', 'course', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'forced', 'work', 'house', 'boss', 'have', 'agree', 'decorate', 'holidays', 'Inevitably', 'bond', 'kiss', 'elevator', 'knowing', 'identity', 'girl', 'spoiling', 'ending', 'suffice', 'say', 'similar', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'here', 'there', 'move', 'are', 'bit', 'implausible', 'girl', 'boss', 'so', 'horrific', 'almost', 'not', 'believable', 'Other', 'well-done', 'low-budget', 'film', 'ton', 'chemistry', 'main', 'characters', 'find', 'really', 'hoping', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'watch', 'more', 'loose', 'retelling', 'Cinderella', 'tale', 'rather', 'realistic', 'real-life', 'story', 'would', 'recommend', 'clean', 'feel-good', 'Christmas', 'stories']",N/A

One night, Wendy gets into an elevator with a mysterious man, who kisses her when she gets thrown into his arm when they think the elevator is about to plummet (because of course that is what you think of when you think your going to die;)  Unfortunately, Wendy discovers the next day that the mysterious man is Priscilla's boyfriend, Adam, (and he doesn't recognize Wendy!!!).  Adam asks Pricilla to decorate his apartment for a Christmas party.  Wendy is inspired by Adam's love for a book his Grandmother bought him before she died,  and creates a design that reflects that theme.  Pricilla says they are absolutely horrible and it won't impress anyone; however, when Adam turns down Pricilla's own design, she claims Wendy's as her own and Adam loves them.  Pricilla leaves town after an accident where she was hit in the face.  Adam and Wendy's friendship grows since they are now thrown together to finish getting the house ready in time.  He starts to fall in love with her and rethinks proposing to Pricilla, but when Pricilla comes home and she is then forced to take drastic measures to make sure her engagement goes forward as planned.  She lies and schemes to get Adam to propose, fires Wendy and threatens her to not tell Adam, but thanks to Wendy's two friends, they do some scheming of their own to get Adam and Wendy back together.Overall, I loved the movie and will definitely watch it again.",5,A Christmas Kiss - Will definately watch again,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,2025,"['like', 'good', 'clean', 'movies', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Christmas', 'Kiss', 'was', 'fairly', 'clean', 'swearing', 'not', 'extreme', 'noticeable', 'low', 'cut/short', 'shirts/dresses', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'again', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'skip', 'think', 'too', 'predictable', '34', 'lame', '34', 'like', 'movies', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'just', 'been', '34', 'slimed', '34', '.Wendy', 'aspiring', 'designer', 'assistant', 'most', 'successful', 'designer', 'Boston', 'Priscilla', 'who', 'hate', 'entire', 'show', 'One', 'night', 'Wendy', 'elevator', 'mysterious', 'man', 'who', 'when', 'thrown', 'arm', 'when', 'think', 'elevator', 'plummet', 'course', 'what', 'think', 'when', 'think', 'going', 'die', 'Unfortunately', 'Wendy', 'next', 'day', 'mysterious', 'man', 'Priscilla', 'boyfriend', 'Adam', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Wendy', 'Adam', 'Pricilla', 'decorate', 'apartment', 'Christmas', 'party', 'Wendy', 'inspired', 'Adam', 'love', 'book', 'Grandmother', 'bought', 'died', 'design', 'theme', 'Pricilla', 'are', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'wo', ""n't"", 'impress', 'anyone', 'however', 'when', 'Adam', 'down', 'Pricilla', 'own', 'design', 'Wendy', 'own', 'Adam', 'Pricilla', 'town', 'accident', 'where', 'was', 'hit', 'face', 'Adam', 'Wendy', 'friendship', 'are', 'now', 'thrown', 'together', 'finish', 'getting', 'house', 'ready', 'time', 'fall', 'love', 'rethinks', 'proposing', 'Pricilla', 'when', 'Pricilla', 'home', 'then', 'forced', 'take', 'drastic', 'measures', 'make', 'sure', 'engagement', 'forward', 'planned', 'schemes', 'get', 'Adam', 'propose', 'fires', 'Wendy', 'not', 'tell', 'Adam', 'thanks', 'Wendy', 'two', 'friends', 'do', 'scheming', 'own', 'get', 'Adam', 'Wendy', 'back', 'together.Overall', 'loved', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

However, the movie is overflowing with cliches, almost to the point of suffocation. The plot was entirely predictable from scene 1.

But her roommates could see that this kiss had brought a new spark to their friend. Wendy had left her job as a set designer for community theater to work for a star in the interior design world, hoping to advance her own career. But her boss, Miss Hall, is demanding, self centered, and unscrupulous. Wendy is called upon at all hours to fulfill Miss Hall's every whim. Now this mysterious man who kissed her as the elevator seemed to have doomed them to perish together, has breathed fresh life into her heart. Problem is, Wendy was rather disguised when the kiss took place, so he would not recognize her, and she has no idea who he is.One day his identity is revealed and Wendy must work closely with him while he has no idea who she is. Her roommates want her to tell him, but she can't bring herself to do it.Meanwhile, things with her boss are going from bad to worse. Wendy receives an ultimatum that could ruin her chances of ever being hired in her chosen field without leaving town.A fun plot where you are cheering on the ""good guy"" and booing the mean boss, much like a melodrama. The roommates are quirky, with good hearts, and the leading characters are well played.I enjoyed the story, but for me it was marred by the language--mostly what we refer to at our house as potty language. Unnecessary crude words that slipped occasionally from a character's mouth. It wasn't frequent, but it needn't have happened at all. On top of that, there was a tendency to profane the Lord's name.
