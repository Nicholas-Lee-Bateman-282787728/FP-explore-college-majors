717284,A2IF6UKZCV0V0Y,B00006IUIW,"C. Clay ""drakkar91""","[2, 2]","Rather then 2 hours of a band standing on a stage singing songs, this DVD collection takes the viewer on a journey, a tour of Italy, as we follow ""the Calling"" with lead singer Alex Band through the city scapes and countryside of Italy.  Just short of 1 hour, the collection includes the bands popular songs including ""Wherever You Will Go"" (my personal favorite), ""Could It Be Any Harder"", ""Unstoppable"" and several more for a total of 8 performances (if you count the bonus track in the DVD extras).  The extras themselves are so-so, with the exception of a ""music only"" section which allows you to simply sit back and watch all the performances without the chit-chat and extras in the full feature.  This is a really nice extra!  The performances are captured throughout Italy, all acoustic in style.  Worth adding to your collection.  A 5-star rating would have required better extras, including some of the studio version videos.",4,Excellent Production - A Trip to Italy with The Calling...,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,934,"['Rather', 'then', '2', 'hours', 'band', 'standing', 'stage', 'singing', 'songs', 'DVD', 'collection', 'viewer', 'journey', 'tour', 'Italy', 'follow', 'Calling', 'lead', 'singer', 'Alex', 'Band', 'city', 'scapes', 'countryside', 'Italy', 'Just', 'short', '1', 'hour', 'collection', 'bands', 'popular', 'songs', 'including', 'Wherever', 'Will', 'Go', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Could', 'Be', 'Any', 'Harder', 'Unstoppable', 'several', 'more', 'total', '8', 'performances', 'count', 'bonus', 'track', 'DVD', 'extras', 'extras', 'are', 'so-so', 'exception', 'music', 'only', 'section', 'simply', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'performances', 'chit-chat', 'extras', 'full', 'feature', 'really', 'nice', 'extra', 'performances', 'are', 'captured', 'Italy', 'acoustic', 'style', 'Worth', 'adding', 'collection', '5-star', 'rating', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'better', 'extras', 'including', 'studio', 'version', 'videos']",The Calling: Live in Italy

717286,A329U9CDUPKXAC,B00006IUIW,Patrick,"[3, 9]","I love The Calling. I play their CD all the time. I was really looking forward to this DVD but I was more than a bit let down. I think Alex Band has a beautiful voice but when he performs live he sounds so weak and amateurish. He totally misses half the notes in each song and completely avoids any difficult notes. He really needs a vocal coach. You can see on his face that he knows he sounds bad. Also, he's a bit stiff when he performs. He puts his hands in his pockets because he doesn't know what else to do with them and 99% of the time he just stands in one place. He's no Elvis. I do LOVE their music but this band is best heard on a CD and not in concert.",2,They shouldn't perform live,1050537600,"04 17, 2003",2003,665,"['love', 'Calling', 'play', 'CD', 'time', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'DVD', 'was', 'more', 'bit', 'let', 'think', 'Alex', 'Band', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'when', 'so', 'weak', 'amateurish', 'totally', 'notes', 'song', 'completely', 'avoids', 'difficult', 'notes', 'really', 'vocal', 'coach', 'can', 'see', 'face', 'bad', 'Also', 'bit', 'stiff', 'when', 'hands', 'pockets', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'do', '99', '%', 'time', 'just', 'one', 'place', 'Elvis', 'do', 'LOVE', 'music', 'band', 'best', 'heard', 'CD', 'not', 'concert']",The Calling: Live in Italy
