She thinks that the baby needs to be inside out of the cold so she steps in and does the good  deed of taking it inside to complete the delivery.  When the orphanage  won't accept her story about being a passerby she finds herself literally  left holding the bag, with the baby in it.  The rest of the story is full  of the misadventures that come with trying to juggle a single woman's urban  life with demands of caring for a baby.  Come to think of it, it took three  men (Danson, Selleck, and Guttenberg) in &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;  to equal Ginger Rogers in this movie.  Both of the movies work.I'd  recommend this movie, but it's certainly not a classic in my mind.",3,"Funny in places, but not a classic",931737600,"07 12, 1999",1999,809,"['beginning', 'movie', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'someone', 'dropping', 'baby', 'steps', 'orphanage', 'winter', 'day', 'baby', 'be', 'inside', 'cold', 'good', 'deed', 'taking', 'complete', 'delivery', 'When', 'orphanage', 'wo', ""n't"", 'accept', 'story', 'being', 'passerby', 'literally', 'left', 'holding', 'bag', 'baby', 'rest', 'story', 'full', 'misadventures', 'come', 'trying', 'juggle', 'single', 'woman', 'urban', 'life', 'demands', 'caring', 'baby', 'Come', 'think', 'took', 'three', 'men', 'Danson', 'Selleck', 'Guttenberg', 'quot', 'Three', 'Men', 'Baby', 'quot', 'equal', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'movie', 'movies', 'work.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'classic', 'mind']",Bachelor Mother VHS

28202,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780615573,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","In my attempt to watch every movie made in the year that was 1939 (a goal I think every cinephille should set), I stumbled across this little movie I'd never heard of but I was surprised to hear actually made real bank back in that year.  Yes, Ginger Rogers heads an impressive cast in this Garson Kanin comedy about a young department store clerk who stumbles across a baby being left at an orphanage.  She feels pity on the young soul and bends down to comfort him just as the doors are opened and she is assumed the baby's mother.  She obviously denies this and flees, but the orphanage tracks her down and soon everyone believes it is her child.The improbability of this film is somewhat irritating at times.  I just find it preposterous to suggest that absolutely no one could come to Polly's defense and prove that this child wasn't hers.  I understand that it was yesteryear and so they couldn't do any DNA testing as proof, but surely the woman had friends or family that saw her regularly and could say ""hey, I've been around her for years and she's never sported a baby bump"".  I know that this is fictional and I know that this is a comedy, which is why I forgive it some of its ridiculousness (and obviously why I still give it a higher grade) but I do like my comedies to have a level of wits about them and I would be lying if I said that that fact didn't glare in my mind's eye throughout the bulk of this film.That said, Ginger Rogers is delightfully mesmerizing here, and David Niven really steals the young employer who falls madly in love with her after attempting to `help her out'.  I'm a sucker for Charles Coburn as well, and so I was excited to see him have such a plum role here.There is enough charm to go on for days here, despite the fact that the film is under an hour and a half in length.  It certainly makes the most of its running time, delivering laughs at almost every corner. Honestly, outside of a certain issue, I can't really fault the film at all.  It is fun and sweet and charming and it stands the test of time as well.  There are many memorable scenes here, most notably the dinner scene in which Rogers pretends to be a Swedish heiress who cannot speak English.  Her comedic chops are certainly on full display.  I will note, as I already have to a degree, that David Niven is the standout here.  I just thought he was outstandingly in tune with the internal flow of the film.  He captured the shock and surprise and genuine concern of his character, gradually developing young Merlin with ease.So watch it.  It's a little known gem of a film that will bring a genuine smile!",4,A baby changes everything...,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,2619,"['attempt', 'watch', 'movie', 'made', 'year', 'was', '1939', 'goal', 'think', 'cinephille', 'should', 'set', 'stumbled', 'little', 'movie', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'was', 'surprised', 'hear', 'actually', 'made', 'real', 'bank', 'back', 'year', 'Yes', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'impressive', 'cast', 'Garson', 'Kanin', 'comedy', 'young', 'department', 'store', 'clerk', 'who', 'baby', 'being', 'left', 'orphanage', 'pity', 'young', 'soul', 'down', 'comfort', 'just', 'doors', 'are', 'opened', 'assumed', 'baby', 'mother', 'obviously', 'flees', 'orphanage', 'down', 'soon', 'everyone', 'child.The', 'improbability', 'film', 'somewhat', 'irritating', 'times', 'just', 'find', 'preposterous', 'suggest', 'absolutely', 'one', 'could', 'come', 'Polly', 'defense', 'prove', 'child', 'was', ""n't"", 'hers', 'understand', 'was', 'yesteryear', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'DNA', 'testing', 'proof', 'surely', 'woman', 'had', 'friends', 'family', 'saw', 'regularly', 'could', 'say', 'hey', ""'ve"", 'been', 'years', 'never', 'sported', 'baby', 'bump', 'know', 'fictional', 'know', 'comedy', 'why', 'forgive', 'ridiculousness', 'obviously', 'why', 'still', 'give', 'higher', 'grade', 'do', 'comedies', 'have', 'level', 'wits', 'would', 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'glare', 'mind', 'eye', 'bulk', 'film.That', 'said', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'delightfully', 'mesmerizing', 'here', 'David', 'Niven', 'really', 'young', 'employer', 'who', 'madly', 'love', 'attempting', 'help', 'out', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'have', 'plum', 'role', 'enough', 'charm', 'go', 'days', 'here', 'fact', 'film', 'hour', 'half', 'length', 'certainly', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'delivering', 'laughs', 'almost', 'corner', 'Honestly', 'certain', 'issue', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'fault', 'film', 'fun', 'sweet', 'charming', 'test', 'time', 'well', 'are', 'many', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'here', 'most', 'notably', 'dinner', 'scene', 'Rogers', 'be', 'Swedish', 'heiress', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'English', 'comedic', 'chops', 'are', 'certainly', 'full', 'display', 'will', 'note', 'already', 'have', 'degree', 'David', 'Niven', 'standout', 'here', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'outstandingly', 'tune', 'internal', 'flow', 'film', 'captured', 'shock', 'surprise', 'genuine', 'concern', 'character', 'gradually', 'developing', 'young', 'Merlin', 'ease.So', 'watch', 'little', 'known', 'gem', 'film', 'will', 'bring', 'genuine', 'smile']",Bachelor Mother VHS
28203,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,0780615573,Bobby Underwood,"[55, 57]","Garson Kanin directed this Norman Krasna screenplay and if you ever doubt the magic of Ginger Rogers you have only to watch this film for absolute proof. The always loveable Charles Coburn and a young, dashing and very funny David Niven help this become a true classic. Ginger gives a sweet and comical performance that is a reminder of just how great she really was.Ginger plays Polly Parrish, temporary Christmas help at Merlin & Son's department store. Charles Coburn is J. B. Merlin and David Niven is his footloose son David. Ginger is given her pink slip along with the other Christmas help and upon leaving the store comes across an old woman leaving a small baby on the steps of an orphanage. Ginger of course picks the baby up as the door opens and from here on in everyone assumes it's hers!When she leaves the baby there it is traced back to her former employer and Niven agrees to keep her on so she can keep her baby! Ginger gets tired of explaining how it's not her baby and since she is slowly but surely becoming the baby's mother anyway she gives in. A very funny Niven keeps stopping buy to ""help"" and he and Ginger have some truly nice moments together.When Niven is stood up on New Year's Eve he stops by to get Ginger and once the clothes and fur coat arrive they are off to rub it in the face of the stuffy girl who stood him up. To Ginger's shock he introduces her as a Swedish girl who can't speak a word of english! It's hilarious as they make up a language that's anything but Swedish and Ginger is the toast of the party, dancing with everyone. The scene after the date, as Ginger talks to her baby about it will make you fall in love with her.When a disgruntled employee tells Coburn that the baby is his son's, he is overjoyed to have a grandson. The attempts of Niven and Ginger to convince him otherwise turns to hilarity when they both produce the actual ""father"" of Ginger's baby, at the same time! The baby really is Ginger's by now and Niven, of course, realizes he loves both of them.Ginger Rogers was a wonderful light comedic actress and along with ""Lucky Partners"" with Ronald Coleman, ""Fifth Avenue Girl,"" and her Oscar winning ""Kitty Foyle,"" this is one of her finest films. This is a great comedy you'll watch more than once. Ginger Rogers was the sweet American girl next door. She was never prettier than in this film and simply exudes a luminous charm in every scene. This might just be her finest performance.This is a movie that will have you laughing or smiling all the way through. Anyone who ever questions the importance of Ginger Rogers in American cinema need only be reminded that in the tiny annex where Anne Frank spent so much time, where every inch of space was precious and guarded, was a torn out picture from a movie magazine---- of Ginger Rogers.",5,The Magic of Ginger,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,2808,"['Garson', 'Kanin', 'directed', 'Norman', 'Krasna', 'screenplay', 'ever', 'doubt', 'magic', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'have', 'only', 'watch', 'film', 'absolute', 'proof', 'always', 'loveable', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'young', 'dashing', 'very', 'funny', 'David', 'Niven', 'help', 'become', 'true', 'classic', 'Ginger', 'sweet', 'comical', 'performance', 'reminder', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'really', 'was.Ginger', 'plays', 'Polly', 'Parrish', 'temporary', 'Christmas', 'help', 'Merlin', 'Son', 'department', 'store', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'J', 'B.', 'Merlin', 'David', 'Niven', 'footloose', 'son', 'David', 'Ginger', 'given', 'pink', 'slip', 'other', 'Christmas', 'help', 'leaving', 'store', 'old', 'woman', 'leaving', 'small', 'baby', 'steps', 'orphanage', 'Ginger', 'course', 'baby', 'up', 'door', 'opens', 'here', 'everyone', 'hers', 'When', 'baby', 'traced', 'back', 'former', 'employer', 'Niven', 'keep', 'can', 'keep', 'baby', 'Ginger', 'tired', 'explaining', 'how', 'not', 'baby', 'slowly', 'surely', 'becoming', 'baby', 'mother', 'anyway', 'very', 'funny', 'Niven', 'stopping', 'buy', 'help', 'Ginger', 'have', 'truly', 'nice', 'moments', 'together.When', 'Niven', 'stood', 'up', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'get', 'Ginger', 'once', 'clothes', 'fur', 'coat', 'are', 'rub', 'face', 'stuffy', 'girl', 'who', 'stood', 'up', 'Ginger', 'shock', 'Swedish', 'girl', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'word', 'english', 'hilarious', 'make', 'up', 'language', 'anything', 'Swedish', 'Ginger', 'toast', 'party', 'dancing', 'everyone', 'scene', 'date', 'Ginger', 'talks', 'baby', 'will', 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'disgruntled', 'employee', 'tells', 'Coburn', 'baby', 'son', 'overjoyed', 'have', 'grandson', 'attempts', 'Niven', 'Ginger', 'convince', 'otherwise', 'hilarity', 'when', 'produce', 'actual', 'father', 'Ginger', 'baby', 'same', 'time', 'baby', 'really', 'Ginger', 'now', 'Niven', 'course', 'them.Ginger', 'Rogers', 'was', 'wonderful', 'light', 'comedic', 'actress', 'Lucky', 'Partners', 'Ronald', 'Coleman', 'Fifth', 'Avenue', 'Girl', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Kitty', 'Foyle', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'great', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'was', 'sweet', 'American', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'was', 'never', 'prettier', 'film', 'simply', 'exudes', 'luminous', 'charm', 'scene', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'finest', 'performance.This', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'smiling', 'way', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'questions', 'importance', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'American', 'cinema', 'need', 'only', 'be', 'reminded', 'tiny', 'annex', 'where', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'where', 'inch', 'space', 'was', 'precious', 'guarded', 'was', 'torn', 'out', 'picture', 'movie', 'magazine', 'Ginger', 'Rogers']",Bachelor Mother VHS

Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn all star in this delightful comedy.Ginger Rogers is a store clerk who happens to see a woman leaving a baby at the door of a church.  She rushes forward to tell the woman not to do such a thing when suddenly the woman flees and the door opens.  Ginger is assumed to be the mother of the baby and the priest insists that she keeps the child.  And from there the story springs.The Church, in their role of helping, interferes at the store to make sure Ginger keeps her job so that she can raise the child.  This brings her to the attention of her boss.  Fascination and romance follow.Ginger is like a rider on a roller coaster. She can not get off or change things.  She must hold on as best she can until the ride ends.This movie is wonderful and delightful, but only really works if one accepts the innocent nature of films of the day.  Ginger is accused of having a baby.  Even the people she has worked with every day believe it.  All this despite that fact that in the movie Ginger has a waist of about sixteen inches and there is no way she could have been pregnant without everyone seeing her condition.

At first I was like, meh, since it stars two of my all time least favorite stars in Hollywood, but you know what?  Maybe it was the multiple egg nogs, or the tinsel beckoning on the Dutch elm, but I wound up enjoying both Ginger Rogers and David Niven very much.  They were each more talented than I gave them credit for, though to me, and maybe this is just a personal thing, I just don't see Niven as the sort of heartthrob that all the girls in the department store would swoon over (and the guys too, all falling over themselves to butter him up when he deigns to grace the toy department).In fact although I wound up liking Niven, I wound up disliking his character intensely.  In one sequence he takes Ginger Rogers to a high society New Years Eve party, and when she expresses nervousness about conversing with her betters at the dinner table, he doesn't say to her, you're as good as anyone else, he just passes her off as Swedish (unable to speak a word of English).  I remember in the Mapp and Lucia books this would often happen--I wonder if Garson Kanin who wrote this screenplay was familiar with the classic comic novels of E F Benson--only difference is if Benson wrote the screenplay Ginger would have been horrified when an actual Swedish speaker came up and tried to talk with her in what he would presume was her native tongue.  Anyhow Niven is thoroughly class bound in this inter-class comedy, and if it weren't for the baby it wouldn't have been half as much fun.  Who played that baby, anyhow?  Probably dozens of little infants, since ""John"" changes every time a new expression is needed to show on his face, but whoever they were, they were darned cute kids.  Probably around 70 now--wonder if any of them are still alive?Another one who probably watched this movie was Lucille Ball, Ginger's great friend in real life, for one realizes watching it that everything Lucy did on her later TV series, Ginger was doing in this movie.

She hated the script and had to be threatened with a release from her contract to do it. She went to a pre-release screening of the film, during which the audience was literally falling on the floor laughing. Afterward she said, ""I told you it was a dog.""

It's a rom-com for the ages, with funny slapstick and a great leading man in David Niven at his handsomest. Charles Coburn has perhaps his best line in a film: ""You may not be the mother, and you may not be the father, but I'm the grandfather!"" The film is canny about class differences, but it's basically a Cinderella story at its most sophisticated (the original story by Felix Jackson got an Oscar nomination).

28225,A3FBZDOS0SKVIJ,0780615573,Paulina S,"[1, 1]","This rollicking movie has everything you could hope to find in a rom-com and just don't anymore:  a smart and plucky heroine, a playboy with a sense of decency, a witty, double-entendre screenplay, and a major dilemma.  When holiday temp worker Polly Parrish goes to the aid of a baby left on a foundling home doorstep, everyone assumes the child is hers--and well-intentioned miscommunications and muddles abound.As Polly, Ginger Rogers knocks the ball out of the park, demonstrating again that she is one of the most underrated actresses of her generation.  Her comedic timing is as superb as her dance timing--she speaks and reacts in such a perfectly natural and likeable way you can't wait to see how she's going to handle the next bump in the road. You're rooting for her from the very first frame and absolutely cheering for her by the movie's end.She is equally matched by David Niven, who has never been more appealing than in his role as her employer's dashing son. They have wonderful chemistry as they alternately spar and join forces.  Their scene together at a fancy New Year's Eve party is flat-out hilarious. Rogers and Niven seem to have a blast as they pull the wool over the eyes of some disagreeable tablemates, and this sense of fun just zings off the screen. This segues into a more tender moment that manages to have plenty of sexual tension while remaining sweetly innocent.I think children will love this film (among other things it includes a denouement with a mechanical duck), but adults of all ages will enjoy it because of the acting, the snarl of misunderstandings, the humor, and how niftily screenwriter Norman Krasna flirts with innuendo without ever crossing the line. And the baby is adorable!Although very different in subject matter and tone, it reminds me a bit of ""Roman Holiday"" and ""While You Were Sleeping"" in showcasing two incredibly personable actors at their charming best and in situations that are both identifiable and yet modern fairy tales.Here's hoping it will get the first-class restoration it deserves, as the current copy is a bit grainy and offers no extras.However, it is such a terrific film, it's easy to overlook any technical flaws.

It is even worse when you are held responsible for everything you didn't do.The young and beautiful unmarried Polly Parish (Ginger Rogers) finds herself in just such a comical situation when one day she passes a orphanage and sees a woman leaving a baby on the stairs. Before she can stop the woman, she finds herself picking up the baby for fear it will roll off the steps. The door opens and everyone assumes this is her baby. Frustrated, she leaves and won't assume responsibility for the child. Later the baby is returned to her and she takes a liking to the cute little bundle of fun.On the same day she is fired from her department store job and this makes everyone believe she has had to give up her child due to her job loss. Of course, it gets even more comical when everyone assumes the department store owner (David Niven) is the father.If I tell you too much about this movie, it will simply spoil the plot. It is similar to a comedy of errors in which everyone makes the wrong assumptions and takes action on what they consider to be the facts.I really had great fun watching this movie, although seeing such a cute baby in this movie started to get the maternal clock ticking again.It is interesting to note that Ginger Rogers ""at first"" refused to appear in this movie, however she was somehow convinced to play the part.

The officials inside believe Rogers to be the mother.........RKO's boy wonder of 1939 was Garson Kanin; the unknown novice director was 25 when he brillianty directed John Barrymore in THE GREAT MAN VOTES; he was rewarded by directing the studio's brightest star, Ginger Rogers in BACHELOR MOTHER. The vivacious Ginger Rogers had one of her best comedy roles in this movie, and along with her performances in STAGE DOOR (1937) and VIVACIOUS LADY (1938) she proved to audiences and critics alike that she was indeed capable of doing more than dance beautifully with Fred Astaire.  A slight but dextrously handled comedy, it's story is less than a screen classic, but Garson's neat touches and the engaging presence of Ginger Rogers make it a throughly enjoyable diversion.
