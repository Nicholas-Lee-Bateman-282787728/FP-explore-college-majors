190861,A2582KMXLK2P06,1573628697,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Sometimes the most unexpected surprises are the best.  I was supposed to see Hide & Seek tonight, the movie starring Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning, but a mix-up occurred and I actually see the movie of the same name but starring Jennifer Tilly instead.  VERY good unexpected surprise (unless the Hide & Seek starring Robert DeNiro is actually even better than this one- I won't know until I see it, though).First of all, my father and myself LOVE Jennifer Tilly.  We think she's not only extremely gorgeous, but one of the best actresses ever.  Her voice is uniquely soothing and sexy as well.  But somehow *neither* of us knew about Hide & Seek which might very well be the best performance of Jennifer Tilly's life (and she's starred in PLENTY of great films).She stars as a woman obsessed with being a mother, but when her baby is apparently born deformed, she and her boyfriend (or husband) kidnap a woman and make her pregnant.  The goal here is to keep this pregnant woman healthy and chained to the bed in the basement until the baby is born, and then kill the mother.  Pretty twisted, huh?  Pretty spectacular for a plotline too!  The best moments occur whenever someone visits, and Jennifer Tilly finds clever ways to get out of a jam so the people don't suspect what's going on.  This is definitely a suspense just so you know.I can honestly say this is the type of suspense that's remarkably similar to Kathy Bates in Misery.  Jennifer Tilly's mannerisms, oddball personality and facial expressions remind me of Kathy Bates in that legendary performance of Misery (even though Jennifer's character is WAY more boisterous) and the comedy is done is a sick and psychotic way which isn't really supposed to be funny but you can't help but laugh a few times (mostly due to the weird combination of immaturity and psychopathic tendencies of Jennifer Tilly's wonderfully expressed character).  You might even say Jennifer Tilly's a more caring mother than *anyone* in the world!  She wants the baby to be born just right.  Caring... but certainly not fitting, haha.Amazing how many twists and turns happen throughout the movie but time and time again I have to say shame on the mother for never getting the job done when she has several opportunities to put an end to Jennifer Tilly's psychotic behavior and run away from the basement she's trapped in.  Jennifer Tilly MAKES this movie so incredibly fun.  Why this movie was never popular or highly regarded remains an enormous mystery.  The only negative are the generic Lifetime Movie Network-quality scenes with the pregnant woman's husband trying to move on believing his wife had been killed and meeting other woman/communicating with the cops.

190868,A34D06JL7LC6MU,1573628697,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 7]","Hide and Seek"" is a movie that most people will never see and that's not only because it's now going to be confused with the Robert De Niro-Dakota Fanning film of the same name. The reason I saw this movie was because I'm a huge fan of Vincent Gallo and wanted to see more of his acting work (I've seen his two directorial efforts, Buffalo 66 & The Brown Bunny, and two other films he acted in called Palookaville and The Funeral). I'm not positive, but I think this movie was straight-to-video; I heard someone say that, but it doesn't have the ""direct-to-video"" feel to it. That's not to say it's not a bad movie, because it kind of is...But, whatever. The movie stars Daryl Hannah and Bruce Greenwood as a happily married couple named Anne and Jack who desparately vie to have a baby. It seems they've succeeded, but the clinic tells them that they're not pregnant. Jack goes on a business trip, leaving Anne alone and in the middle of the night she's kidnapped. When she wakes up, she's handcuffed to a bed in the basement of a house. At first, Anne is confused, not really noticing she's handcuffed and an odd woman named Helen (Jennifer Tilly) is trying to get her to eat. When she starts reacting, Helen's husband Frank (Gallo) comes downstairs and explains she's been kidnapped. Frank then calls Jack and asks for ransom. The latter is merely an excuse to make the movie longer, because Helen reveals that they're holding her to have her baby, so they can take it for themselves. Frank works at the clinic where Anne had a pregnancy test and he forged it and then faked her death so no one would be looking for her. When Jack returns to discover his wife missing/dead he doesn't believe it and goes looking for it, hence...Hide and seek. The plot of the film and Tilly's character owe a lot to the movie ""Misery."" In that movie, an insane woman takes an injured writer hostage in her house. In this movie, a man takes a pregnant woman hostage for his insane wife. Helen is very childlike and annoying and, we later find out, pretty sadistic. This movie tries for some chills and thrills, but the only thing remotely disturbing is Gallo's demise in the movie. If you are a Gallo fan (and most people aren't), you can feel OK passing this movie up. I am giving it four stars, because it wasn't dull. It did keep me entertained for the 100 minutes, but it was a pretty stupid movie. Why does it never occur to these characters to just adopt? Who does it seem that Helen runs Frank's life? Why does Vincent Gallo look like a hippie? There's a lot of unanswered questions left with us. If you're looking for a movie you're going to enjoy and recommend, I'd see something else. But if you, for some odd reason, have this movie in your house; It's not a complete waste of time.GRADE: B-DESERVES MORE LIKE A: C+",4,Not as Bad As It's Made to Be,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,2811,"['Hide', 'Seek', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'now', 'going', 'be', 'confused', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro-Dakota', 'Fanning', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'reason', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'acting', 'work', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'Buffalo', '66', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'acted', 'called', 'Palookaville', 'Funeral', ""'m"", 'not', 'positive', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'straight-to-video', 'heard', 'someone', 'say', ""n't"", 'have', 'direct-to-video', 'feel', 'not', 'say', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'kind', 'movie', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'happily', 'married', 'couple', 'named', 'Anne', 'Jack', 'who', 'desparately', 'vie', 'have', 'baby', ""'ve"", 'succeeded', 'clinic', 'tells', ""'re"", 'not', 'pregnant', 'Jack', 'business', 'trip', 'leaving', 'Anne', 'alone', 'middle', 'night', 'kidnapped', 'When', 'up', 'handcuffed', 'bed', 'basement', 'house', 'first', 'Anne', 'confused', 'not', 'really', 'noticing', 'handcuffed', 'odd', 'woman', 'named', 'Helen', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'trying', 'get', 'eat', 'When', 'reacting', 'Helen', 'husband', 'Frank', 'Gallo', 'downstairs', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'Frank', 'then', 'Jack', 'asks', 'ransom', 'latter', 'merely', 'excuse', 'make', 'movie', 'longer', 'Helen', 'reveals', ""'re"", 'holding', 'have', 'baby', 'can', 'take', 'Frank', 'clinic', 'where', 'Anne', 'had', 'pregnancy', 'test', 'forged', 'then', 'faked', 'death', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'looking', 'When', 'Jack', 'discover', 'wife', 'missing/dead', ""n't"", 'believe', 'looking', 'hence', 'Hide', 'seek', 'plot', 'film', 'Tilly', 'character', 'owe', 'lot', 'movie', 'Misery', 'movie', 'insane', 'woman', 'injured', 'writer', 'hostage', 'house', 'movie', 'man', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'hostage', 'insane', 'wife', 'Helen', 'very', 'childlike', 'annoying', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'pretty', 'sadistic', 'movie', 'chills', 'thrills', 'only', 'thing', 'remotely', 'disturbing', 'Gallo', 'demise', 'movie', 'are', 'Gallo', 'fan', 'most', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'can', 'feel', 'OK', 'passing', 'movie', 'up', 'am', 'giving', 'four', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'dull', 'did', 'keep', 'entertained', '100', 'minutes', 'was', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'movie', 'Why', 'never', 'occur', 'characters', 'just', 'adopt', 'Who', 'seem', 'Helen', 'Frank', 'life', 'Why', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'look', 'hippie', 'lot', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'left', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'enjoy', 'recommend', ""'d"", 'see', 'something', 'else', 'odd', 'reason', 'have', 'movie', 'house', 'not', 'complete', 'waste', 'time.GRADE', 'B-DESERVES', 'MORE', 'A', 'C+']",N/A

Not to be confused with another 'Hide and Seek' (2005) starring Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning.This is a Canadian straight-to-video psycho-thriller, and stars Daryl Hannah, Jennifer Tilly, Vincent Gallo, and Bruce Greenwood.  The director is Canadian B-film master Sidney J. Furie.  I don't know how you feel hearing his name, but I believe he is more talented than some people would think, and with decent budget and script, he could have done better films, far better than, say, under-financed 'Superman IV.'The film is about a pregnant woman played by Hannah suddenly kidnapped by thick-bearded Gallo.  Gallo, it turns out later, does this for his 'baby' Tilly, and locks Hannah up in the dark basement room of his house, and chains her to the bed, nad fakes her death to cover his crime.  Greenwood is Hannah's hubby who seeks for his missing wife.So 'Hide and Seek'?  A suspence, huh?  Yeah, it sounds like 'Misery' or 'The Collector,' but probably before you feel any thrills, you will be either immensely entertained by or absolutely disgusted with Jennifer Tilly's over-the-top acting.  I regret that my poor English cannot fully express the joy of watching campy acting from her, but let me only say that her constant yellings, ultra-heavy make-ups, silly dialogues are hilarious enough to outshine ten Sharons and Halles in the wretched 'Catwoman.'  I'm not blaming her for giving poor acting.  It's like watching the younger version of Kathy Bates (who was Oscar nominated for 'Misery' you know that), and the more I watch her, the more I admire her.As to Gallo, no comment is the kindest comment I can make, and as to Daryl Hannah, probably she has already had this entry erased from her CV circulated among the studios.  I can hear her say, Thank you Quentin Tarantino, you saved my life.At times the film is very nasty (how can you call it entertainment when you have to see a kidnapped pregnant woman forced to eat through a tube strapped to her mouth?), and its story is never convincing (why kidnap a pregnant woman, not a baby?), and most of all, hey, Ms. Hannah played a replicant in 'Bladerunner' who nearly killed Harrison Ford!  Can you kidnap her?  No kidding!So two stars are the best I can give to this film, both for Ms. Tilly for giving one of the most bizarre acting that I have ever seen.
