1650269,A2IXJ8ZYRB68BG,B00CQRNLLU,D. S. Chowes,"[1, 2]","Mr. Ferguson is unique (in the definitive usage of the word). He is the host of THE LATE LATE SHOW (CBS, 12:35 PM,E). Once there was only Carson -- now, about a zillion late night shows. His is simply the best and most sophisticated of them all -- even going back to ""Steverino,"" Paar...Letterman...Leno and the many ""Jimmies.""Letterman is superb and I have watched about two-thirds of both his programs over the past 30 years. He began on NBC by deconstructing this venue. Now, Ferguson has gone far further in the deconstruction effort.His sidekick is well... not a human being -- but rather a dead gay skeleton as they both converse during each program. So, the specter of the Grim Reaper is always part of the ambiance. Then a third regular -- again not human either is a make believe horse played by two guys in some sort of outfit. He converses with the non-speaking horse and translates the horse's physical motions for all of us. Bizarre? Yes!He is constantly using blue material and dances (quite well) with either the horse or a few sexy ladies in ultra sexy outfits.Then, he talks about his alcohol and drug addictions openly. Did I mention his attempt to commit suicide? This man born on Scotland has a European-existentialist approach to life and his ingenious comedy. Didn't someone say that tragedy and comedy are the same -- intertwined?Who else on a network TV broadcast would allude to Nietche, Sartre, Brideshead Revisited, and... No one! Yet, the gig has lasted to date and he has a cult following. For me he is always appointment television via the CBS feed to my TV set or DVR.He is rumored to replace David Letterman (whose company, World Wide Pants), is the producer of the nightly program. Well he can be effective at 12:35 -- but I have my doubts that he can maintain a large enough audience at 11:35 -- with his seemingly and probably improvisational style using a stream of consciousness technique. He is the best!As far as his DVD goes... First get a copy. On CBS which is regulated by the FCC he codes his off-color comments. If you want to see him as he has the complete freedom to speak about anything he thinks or wants to say.There are few working humorists and comedians presently working who are close to him. He has taken comedy to be an art form. (I guess you can say that I like him.}",5,"CRAIG FERGUSON -- ""I'M HERE TO HELP"" (DVD)",1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,2323,"['Mr.', 'Ferguson', 'unique', 'definitive', 'usage', 'word', 'host', 'THE', 'LATE', 'LATE', 'SHOW', 'CBS', '12:35', 'PM', 'E', 'Once', 'was', 'only', 'Carson', 'now', 'zillion', 'late', 'night', 'shows', 'simply', 'best', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'even', 'going', 'back', 'Steverino', 'Paar', 'Letterman', 'Leno', 'many', 'Jimmies', 'Letterman', 'superb', 'have', 'watched', 'two-thirds', 'programs', 'past', '30', 'years', 'began', 'NBC', 'deconstructing', 'venue', 'Now', 'Ferguson', 'gone', 'far', 'further', 'deconstruction', 'effort.His', 'sidekick', 'well', 'not', 'human', 'being', 'rather', 'dead', 'gay', 'skeleton', 'converse', 'program', 'So', 'specter', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'always', 'part', 'ambiance', 'Then', 'third', 'regular', 'again', 'not', 'human', 'make', 'believe', 'horse', 'played', 'two', 'guys', 'sort', 'outfit', 'non-speaking', 'horse', 'horse', 'physical', 'motions', 'Bizarre', 'Yes', 'constantly', 'using', 'blue', 'material', 'dances', 'quite', 'well', 'horse', 'few', 'sexy', 'ladies', 'ultra', 'sexy', 'outfits.Then', 'alcohol', 'drug', 'addictions', 'openly', 'Did', 'mention', 'attempt', 'commit', 'suicide', 'man', 'born', 'Scotland', 'European-existentialist', 'approach', 'life', 'ingenious', 'comedy', 'Did', ""n't"", 'someone', 'say', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'are', 'same', 'intertwined', 'Who', 'else', 'network', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'would', 'allude', 'Nietche', 'Sartre', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'one', 'gig', 'lasted', 'date', 'cult', 'following', 'always', 'appointment', 'television', 'CBS', 'feed', 'TV', 'set', 'DVR.He', 'rumored', 'replace', 'David', 'Letterman', 'company', 'World', 'Wide', 'Pants', 'producer', 'nightly', 'program', 'Well', 'can', 'be', 'effective', '12:35', 'have', 'doubts', 'can', 'maintain', 'large', 'enough', 'audience', '11:35', 'seemingly', 'probably', 'improvisational', 'style', 'using', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'technique', 'best', 'As', 'far', 'DVD', 'First', 'get', 'copy', 'CBS', 'regulated', 'FCC', 'off-color', 'comments', 'want', 'see', 'complete', 'freedom', 'speak', 'anything', 'say.There', 'are', 'few', 'working', 'humorists', 'comedians', 'presently', 'working', 'who', 'are', 'close', 'taken', 'comedy', 'be', 'art', 'form', 'guess', 'can', 'say', 'like']",I'm Here To He
1650270,A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ,B00CQRNLLU,George Waters,"[7, 7]","Yes it is indeed a great day for America with this latest release from TV's Craig Ferguson. Ferguson's live show is something of an extension of his monologue on The Late Late Show, but without any pixelated swear words. Live and in person Craigy Ferg is completely unleashed, sharing his thoughts and observations with us. I've seen him live twice, and this DVD nicely captures the live Ferguson experience. Classically stream of consciousness and subtly intellectual, Craigy Ferg's standup act is amazing. On this DVD he runs the table on topics, including of course his battles with addiction (the raw edge and complete authenticity here is, as always, amazing), Hitler, shark penises, and the ""celebrity culture"" he experiences first-hand in Los Angeles.
