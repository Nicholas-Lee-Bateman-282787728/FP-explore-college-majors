The viewer is now on a journey that filled me with empathy for all the characters involved and affected by the crime. The accused murderer, his family and extended family, and countless other members of a small town. If you enjoy thought provoking films without gore and unneccessary nudity watch this film. It's a taunt mystery, a character study. Great acting. The pace isn't fast but mournful as one feels when pallbearer's march past. Inevitable. Others who commented say the end is open ended. This point of view will leave some viewers feeling dissatisfied. If you don't seek depth and enlightenment in film, don't watch this film. If you don't want to be left pondering the characters and the nature of humanity and punishment and redemption, this is not the film for you.

1641449,A2AN5WDTIQSLWU,B00C1LIZMQ,Blue Leaf,"[6, 9]","I am so glad I came upon this new televion series called RECTIFY. It is like no other t.v. series I have ever seen.  The basic storyline is about a man Daniel Holden, (Aden Young), who has been on death row for nineteen years for the murder of his girlfriend when he was 18 yrs. old.  His legal team has found that the DNA on the girl's body was not his and so they have let him free, for the time being, to go back home.I will warn you the show moves very slowly but in a mesmerizing fashion.  The directing, acting and photography are very well thought out and filmed more like a feature film.  (SPOILER:  So far, after episode six, we do not really know if he is guilty or not but our suspicions are that he is such a caring and insightful person he couldn't possibly commit such a heinous crime.)  The problem might be that we have yet to see what he was like at eighteen.I cannot express how well this program is made.  Every detail has been thought out and there is poetry to its expression, its dialogue, its town and its cast.  The cast is outstanding with a group of actors that I am not quite familiar with.  Two that stand out are Daniel's sister Amantha played by Abigail Spencer, who I do remember for her brief role in MAD MEN, and Adelaide Clemens who plays Daniel's sister-in-law Tawney who tries to pursuade Daniel to find Jesus and be reborn.  You might think the main character is over acting but what do we, as the audience, know what it is like to be incarcerated for nineteen years in solitary confinement.  His mannerisms are quirky and uncomfortable.  He has forgotten what it is like to live in ""the real world"".  He has to readapt to the enviroment that was taken from him half his life ago.  It's a tough role to play.The other actors, mostly members of his family and extended family, are wonderfully played.

1641460,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00C1LIZMQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[18, 20]","The six episode ""Rectify"" is being touted as the first original series created specifically for the Sundance Channel.  And it is quite unlike anything else that you're likely to see on TV this year.  I mean this as the highest compliment.  I was so caught up in this unusual and strangely powerful drama that I watched all six episodes over the course of two days.  A word of warning, though, much of ""Rectify"" is left relatively open-ended. Also, much is left to interpretation.  In this way, it may not satisfy those expecting more conventional television fare.  In truth, the program is a little scattershot and even a tad overcrowded.  I would have liked to follow certain characters or situations more thoroughly.  What is does present, however, is absolutely mesmerizing.  Chilling, spiritual, darkly humorous, contemplative, the show defies easy categorization.  And with an anything could happen feel, I absolutely fell in love with ""Rectify.""  Created by Ray McKinnon (an actor most recently seen on Sons of Anarchy), this is a weighty drama tailor-made for an adult audience looking for an experience with depth and intelligence.Nineteen years after a sexual assault and murder conviction, death row inmate Daniel Holden (Aden Young) is being released on the discovery of new DNA evidence.  This is enormous news for the small community that Holden hails from, where his family still resides, and where the murdered girl lived.  Inviting sympathy, curiosity, and outright hatred, this controversial decision is the jumping off point for these episodes.  Transitioning to a new life on the outside is not easy for Holden, but the strain and adjustment extend to his entire family and the town at large.  Holden seems ill equipped to live in this outside world as his adult life has been spent in a confined routine.  Awkward and distant, he's not an easy character to embrace.  When the show centers on his journey, it creates some indelible moments.  But the screenplay incorporates many more into the action including his mother, his sister, his half brother, his step father, his step brother, his step brother's wife, his lawyer, the town sheriff, the former prosecutor, and several characters that have ties to the long ago crime.  This is not a mystery, however, or a thriller.  This is a slow build drama that realistically looks at how a diverse group of people might handle this unexpected development.I'm not going to discuss too much of the plot, I'll just say that I found the experience to be alternately sad, touching, harrowing, and hilarious.  It creates such a deft blend of emotional responses, it truly is original in both tone and execution.  Credit must be given to smartly observant screenplays and riveting performances.  There isn't a bum note in the cast, but I'll highlight a few.  Abigail Spencer, whom I've seen mostly in comedy (including Yahoo's brilliant Bachelor spoof Burning Love), is fiery and sympathetic as Holden's devoted sister and biggest supporter.  Adelaide Spencer is soft and ethereal as Holden's step sister-in-law, an influence that brings much spirituality to Holden's contemplations.  I can't name everyone, but the entire cast is terrific.  But it is Aden Young who is a complete revelation.  The entire show rests on his shoulders and it is an odd, pinched performance that suits the character perfectly.  Deadpan and understated, ""Rectify"" has presented a completely original lead character.As I mentioned, the show doesn't come to easy resolutions (heck, some things aren't resolved at all).  It just sort of percolates, getting under your skin.  I'll remember so many particular moments (Holden reconnecting with his teenage self, his first sexual experience, a chilling jail house reminiscence, a strange interlude with a goat wrangler, and a memorable finale) but it weaves these individual components into a rich tapestry of small town life.  I suspect some will be perplexed by ""Rectify,"" but those seeking something unique and thoughtful should embrace its ambitions.  On the journey of these episodes, the main plot points can get derailed at times, but I wouldn't change a thing.  Weird, wonderful, and deeply heartfelt, this is for those that don't need everything wrapped up in a convenient bow.

The actors were each fresh and perfect, well-drawn and well-acted.The slow pace of many speeches worked so well and I was riveted.But I found myself angry afterwards. First, because of the completely ragged ending. There is no precedent for such an incomplete ending except and unless there is a promised next season to continue it with.Inside the six-episode story there is a frustrating amorphosity to each of the key story nodes. Is the man guilty? Why not say. Why does the prosecutor demand proof that the man is innocent -- isn't he innocent until she proves him guilty? Who is the man with the figurine-dusting mother? What will be the effects of his throwing the body of the 'witness' into the river? Who are all the masked men who beat up the prisoner? Why do they all have it in for him? Surely they can't all have raped and murdered the 16-year old girl?The seriously withholding mystery of the piece is frustrating and, I think, unnecessary. The story of the experiences of a man who has been in solitary confinement is extremely valuable and well-done. Especially this is important in light of the real stories of the 'SHUs' in California.  So why confound this valuable explication with unclear, fuzzy facts? Give me more.

1641469,A17LEYMZI8OYOQ,B00C1LIZMQ,"Michael B. Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[2, 3]","There is so much to like about RECTIFY, the new one-hour dramatic series that premiered on The Sundance Channel in April.  The actors are, without exception, superb.  The dialogue and individual scenes are absorbing.  The location filming in rural Georgia is striking.The story revolves around Daniel Holden (Aden Young), who has spent the past twenty years on death row for the rape and murder of his girl friend.  Now, because of newly found DNA evidence, his sentence has been vacated; yet officials and residents of the small town in which he grew up, including members of his own family, still believe him to be guilty.Having been incarcerated since he was nineteen, Holden has problems adjusting to the outside world.  His future is also in question, since the current local district attorney, hard-pressed by her predecessor (Michael O'Neill), now a state senator, is trying to build a new case against Daniel.My problem with this series is that, as compelling as the story might be, it would have been better told as a two-hour movie, rather than in these six one-hour episodes that do not give us a conclusion to the mystery (i.e. who killed the girl twenty years ago?).  As a result, the episodes move at a ponderous pace and the season ends with nothing being resolved.  (I assume that the series will return for a second season, though at this writing, a sophomore season is not listed on imdb.)Story-wise, I think that the producers could have put the mystery to rest in this first season, then dealt more with Daniel's adjustment problems in any subsequent seasons.  By not doing that, they take the chance of angering and losing their audience, as was the case with THE KILLING when that show did not reveal the murderer at the end of the freshman season.  When their second season aired, many viewers (including this writer) no longer watched the show.  They had simply ceased to care.Created and written by actor Ray McKinnon, the cast of RECTIFY includes Abigail Spencer, J. Smith-Cameron, Luke Kirby, Clayne Crawford and Adelaide Clemens.DVD extras on the two-disc set from Anchor Bay Entertainment consist of several ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes. Michael B.

This ""mini-series"" (it's just 6 episodes of about 45 minutes each) appeared on the premium Sundance Channel on cable so most folks will discover it - as I did - on DVD (or streaming video). I went into it knowing only that it was a story of a 36 year old man ""readjusting"" after a 20 year prison term when new DNA evidence shows that he might be innocent.  And that's all you need to know. (No spoiler alert from me!). With its short (for a series) time length you can, and should, watch it over a two night (or day) span. It works best that way.This is a story about the ""south"". It takes place in a Georgia town and the prejudices that exist. Some of the caricatures are a bit stock but the acting makes up for it. You can tell it's a cable show when the director feels the need to show a character relieving herself in the bathroom (a scene which, frankly, adds nothing to it except to say ""this is not broadcast TV, we can show things like this""). But that certainly doesn't change my five star rating or recommendation.The DVD comes with five ""bonus features"" such as ""Meet the Cast"", ""Behind the Screen"" and a ""Sundance on Set"" featurette.Unlike the longer cable series on DVD (like ""The Wire"", ""Breaking Bad"", etc. You don't need to set aside weeks to watch this first season. Just a little under five hours will do it.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,A full season of this terrific series in under five hours!,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,1449,"['what', 'great', 'TV', 'about', 'mini-series', 'just', '6', 'episodes', '45', 'minutes', 'appeared', 'premium', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'cable', 'so', 'most', 'folks', 'will', 'discover', 'did', 'DVD', 'streaming', 'video', 'went', 'knowing', 'only', 'was', 'story', '36', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'readjusting', '20', 'year', 'prison', 'term', 'when', 'new', 'DNA', 'evidence', 'shows', 'might', 'be', 'innocent', 'need', 'know', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'short', 'series', 'time', 'can', 'should', 'watch', 'over', 'two', 'night', 'day', 'span', 'best', 'way.This', 'story', 'south', 'place', 'Georgia', 'town', 'prejudices', 'exist', 'caricatures', 'are', 'bit', 'stock', 'acting', 'up', 'can', 'tell', 'cable', 'show', 'when', 'director', 'need', 'show', 'character', 'relieving', 'bathroom', 'scene', 'frankly', 'nothing', 'say', 'not', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'can', 'show', 'things', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'change', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'recommendation.The', 'DVD', 'five', 'bonus', 'features', 'such', 'Meet', 'Cast', 'Screen', 'Sundance', 'Set', 'longer', 'cable', 'series', 'DVD', 'Wire', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'set', 'aside', 'weeks', 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'Just', 'little', 'five', 'hours', 'will', 'do', 'it.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Rectify
