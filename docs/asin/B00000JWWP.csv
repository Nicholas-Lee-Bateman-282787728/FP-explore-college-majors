508293,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00000JWWP,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","I don't know about you, but I surely wouldn't spend around 150 bucks for a DVD.  Sure, the VHS version of ""To Catch a Killer"" (TCAK) is much cheaper, but who has a VHS player nowadays?  They have gone the way of the dinosaur.And if you watch this very fine police procedural, you'll be glad that John Wayne Gacy has gone the way of the dinosaur himself.  When this film released -- all the way back in 1992 -- Mr. Gacy was still alive, but he died from lethal injection just a couple of short years after that.  And to him I say, ""Good riddance.""  But I won't add any goodbyes.If you do a little searching -- I won't mention where but it is easy to figure out -- you will find a site that has this two-parter available for free.  However, don't expect that video to be top notch; it is 4 x 3, and surely not in HD, but more than likely, when this was originally shot, it was probably done on videotape and not widescreen anyways.  After all, it was a made-for-TV special, and HD wasn't really available until around 1999 or so.  Only shows such as ""Hogan's Heroes"" had enough foresight to shoot on film, which have since been digitally remastered.I can tell you that Mr. Gacy's acts were surely illegal, but I'm not so sure about the licensing on that web site implied above.  More than likely, someone posted it who didn't have the rights to redistribute, but this film is so hard to find that, once again, more than likely, the filmmakers wouldn't really care anyways.And that's too bad, because this is really a sharp film.  Brian Dennehy, playing against normal type -- he usually is the cop -- was an inspired choice to play the killer, while Michael Riley was really good as a Sherlock-Holmsian type of detective.  If the real-life detective actually risked his career and even his own finances as much as is implied here, you could surely call him a ""hero.""  And I don't throw that overused word around very often.  OK; almost never.I have seen bits and pieces of the jailhouse interview documentary with Mr. Gacy, and that documentary did a nice job of bouncing back and forth between the interview and the background story.  After watching that, and watching this, I would say that the screenplay is really true to the tale.  ""Hey, it's an unbelievable story, so why change it?"" I always ask.  Luckily, the screenwriter was listening here.One interesting little tidbit for you logicians out there:  Mr. Gacy wasn't much of a logician himself.  He had a terrible tendency to throw out red herrings, and to use non sequitors.  From memory, I believe when he was asked about the horrible stench in his house -- the interviewer implied that the odor came from dead bodies in the crawlspace -- Mr. Gacy went off on a tangent, using something about a poorly-trained dog as an excuse.  Why even go in that direction?  The bodies had already been found, after all, so that was a real head-scratcher.I have seen another web site where the DVD is only about 12 dollars, which is surely a better deal than Amazon.  But if you want to catch it for free, well, you know where to search.  But while you can expect an unexpectedly good film, once again, the video is about as sharp as Mr. Gacy was.",4,The Price is a Crime,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,3192,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'surely', 'would', ""n't"", 'spend', 'around', '150', 'bucks', 'DVD', 'Sure', 'VHS', 'version', 'Catch', 'Killer', 'TCAK', 'much', 'cheaper', 'who', 'VHS', 'player', 'nowadays', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'dinosaur.And', 'watch', 'very', 'fine', 'police', 'procedural', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Gacy', 'gone', 'way', 'dinosaur', 'When', 'film', 'released', 'way', 'back', '1992', 'Mr.', 'Gacy', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'died', 'lethal', 'injection', 'just', 'couple', 'short', 'years', 'say', 'Good', 'riddance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'add', 'goodbyes.If', 'do', 'little', 'searching', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'where', 'easy', 'figure', 'out', 'will', 'find', 'site', 'two-parter', 'available', 'free', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'video', 'be', 'top', 'notch', '4', 'x', '3', 'surely', 'not', 'HD', 'more', 'likely', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'was', 'probably', 'done', 'videotape', 'not', 'widescreen', 'anyways', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'special', 'HD', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'available', '1999', 'so', 'Only', 'such', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'had', 'enough', 'foresight', 'shoot', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'digitally', 'remastered.I', 'can', 'tell', 'Mr.', 'Gacy', 'acts', 'were', 'surely', 'illegal', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'licensing', 'web', 'site', 'implied', 'More', 'likely', 'someone', 'posted', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'rights', 'redistribute', 'film', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'once', 'again', 'more', 'likely', 'filmmakers', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'anyways.And', 'too', 'bad', 'really', 'sharp', 'film', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'playing', 'normal', 'type', 'usually', 'cop', 'was', 'inspired', 'choice', 'play', 'killer', 'Michael', 'Riley', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'Sherlock-Holmsian', 'type', 'detective', 'real-life', 'detective', 'actually', 'risked', 'career', 'even', 'own', 'finances', 'as', 'much', 'implied', 'here', 'could', 'surely', 'call', 'hero', 'do', ""n't"", 'throw', 'overused', 'word', 'very', 'often', 'OK', 'almost', 'never.I', 'have', 'seen', 'bits', 'pieces', 'jailhouse', 'interview', 'documentary', 'Mr.', 'Gacy', 'documentary', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'bouncing', 'back', 'forth', 'interview', 'background', 'story', 'watching', 'watching', 'would', 'say', 'screenplay', 'really', 'true', 'tale', 'Hey', 'unbelievable', 'story', 'so', 'why', 'change', 'always', 'ask', 'Luckily', 'screenwriter', 'was', 'listening', 'here.One', 'interesting', 'little', 'tidbit', 'out', 'there', 'Mr.', 'Gacy', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'logician', 'had', 'terrible', 'tendency', 'throw', 'out', 'red', 'herrings', 'use', 'non', 'sequitors', 'memory', 'believe', 'when', 'was', 'asked', 'horrible', 'stench', 'house', 'interviewer', 'implied', 'odor', 'came', 'dead', 'bodies', 'crawlspace', 'Mr.', 'Gacy', 'went', 'off', 'tangent', 'using', 'something', 'poorly-trained', 'dog', 'excuse', 'Why', 'even', 'go', 'direction', 'bodies', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'found', 'was', 'real', 'head-scratcher.I', 'have', 'seen', 'web', 'site', 'where', 'DVD', 'only', 'about', '12', 'dollars', 'surely', 'better', 'deal', 'Amazon', 'want', 'catch', 'free', 'well', 'know', 'where', 'search', 'can', 'expect', 'unexpectedly', 'good', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'video', 'about', 'as', 'sharp', 'Mr.', 'Gacy', 'was']",N/A

508299,A2KU7P78NO3IKN,B00000JWWP,"M. Elaine Wood ""odd movie buff""","[0, 0]","Out of a spate of 'ripped-from-the-headlines' crime stories to be produced for television in the late Eighties/early Nineties, To Catch a Killer definitely stands out as one of the--if not the--best of the lot.The reasons are simple enough: the cast, their performances, and the intelligence with which the material is handled and presented.As a made for television work, the film has some obvious limitations imposed upon it--no excessive gore and no overt depiction of Gacy's sexual torture of his victims being the most obvious. The brilliance of the teleplay is that it takes what could have been extreme weaknesses, given the subject matter involved, and turns them to real strengths that, through a need to suggest rather than show explicitly, allows the film makers to generate an atmosphere of chills that are perhaps more imaginatively harrowing than any 'full-on' graphic depiction could have managed. The scenes where  Lt. Kozenczak discovers one of Gacy's 'torture dens' in the attic of his suburban tract home, finding a board with handcuffs attached, hooks in the ceiling beams, and a filthy mattress, are honestly horrifying in a low-keyed manner; the implicit image of what has been done in that space is blood-curdling, and the lieutenant's reaction to his findings poignantly and painfully suggests this.Which takes me to the cast, whose performances are outstanding. Brian Dennehy is a terrifying Gacy, one who doesn't allow the man's brutal psychopathy to become too smothered in layers of surface charm. Dennehy's Gacy can be a pleasant and even somewhat charming man in a 'normal' setting, but we're never allowed to forget what he really is; his relations with the police and Kozenczak are effectively used to point up the man's frightening detachment from the murderous holocaust he's at the center of.As another reviewer noted here, it's actor Michael Riley who just as much owns this film as Dennehy, however. His excellently low-keyed portrayal of Joe Kozenczak, the detective committed to bringing Gacy to justice in a last-minute effort (Gacy had in fact in real life threatened to bring a mulitmillion dollar lawsuit against Kozenczak and the Des Plaines police force for harassment, and was  arrested just days before the suit--which he would have likely won--was due to hit the courts) is quietly moving--Riley eschews overt histrionics in his performance to highlight instead the intense perseverance of Kozenczak's determination to stop Gacy, as well as his obviously real understanding of and relation with the anguish of the victims' families. Riley's really fine acting is showcased in a number of small vignettes--his initial and subsequent meetings with the the 'Gant' family (in real life, the Piests; the names of the victims and their families were, I suspect, changed due to a concern with protecting their privacy and general tact on the part of the creators); his supremely sad interview with Gacy's last wife, who is in obvious fear of the man even though they are since divorced; his emotionally wrenching scene with the psychic (a composite of two different psychics who were utilized by the police in the course of the investigation); and, most powerfully of all, in a confrontation with Gacy in the children's ward of a Des Plaines hospital where Gacy, performing his 'Pogo the Clown' act, has baited the detectives in order to taunt them with a stunt that is a clear re-enactment of his techniques of entrapment of his young victims--all the while confident that the police and Kozenczak can do nothing to stop him. Riley's incredibly played, totally non-verbal reaction to this constitutes the final scene of the first of the two parts and is one of the best pieces of acting conveyed totally through facial expressions (particularly the eyes) I've ever seen. Riley's reaction speaks volumes without one word being said, and is possibly the best (and most intense) moment of the film. And it is a moment rivalled by several others of equal intensity.The supporting cast is equally fine--my chief complaint with the heavily abbreviated 90-minute edit of this film is that it stints many of them on their very good performances, as well as omitting a fair amount of background that serves to point up evocatively the sadness and sordidness of Gacy's victims' endings and the lingering horror caused to their families who can have no idea of what's really happened to their missing sons.It's my hope that one day the full three-hour version of this will be available on DVD at an affordable price. Whoever now owns the rights to this needs to set about making it happen, as this movie assuredly deserves to be seen in its' entirety. The utter seriousness and respect for the material, with its clear determination to depict a fearful tragedy in a non-sensationalistic manner make this a textbook illustration of how to produce a riveting, and satisfyingly intelligent filmic depiction of a real-life horror story.",5,One of the better true-crime teleplays of its time,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,4962,"['spate',

508301,A2UNYLCWQRCEG2,B00000JWWP,Soloufein,"[8, 8]","Let me start by saying that i am not normally a fan of TV movies, i have often found them formulaic, bland compromised and badly acted. This film is superbly put together, while watching you cannot help but feel the pain of the victims and their famillies, the director took great pains to show the human side of the horrors which Gacy inflicted on Chicago. The face of this sadness is the detective who is hunting Gacy for the abduction and murder of teenagers, we see him deteriorating mentally throughout the film, often crying tears, he suffers physically and emotionally simply by being in proximity to the horror of the investigation. On the other hand we have Gacy played brilliantly by Dennehy, whoever cast him in this role deserves a lot of credit, he even looks like Gacy. Dennehy injects a massive amount of unpleasantness into his portrayal of the sadistic killer, when he leers and shows his teeth biting his lower lip as he taunts the cops you get the measure that this is a fully fleshed three dimensional monster you are watching. The film is extraordinarily sensitive to the subject matter and despite (or because of) being low on gore the overall effect is completely unsettling and incredibly disturbing, we do not see the horror but it is suggested brilliantly, from the droning noise of the furnace in Gacy's house to the puddles of filth accumulating on the surface of the soil in the crawlspace under his house where the bodies are buried, we take a peek into hell. The pacing and tension throughout the film is maintained well despite the long running time of over three hours. Again, the people who made the film should be congratulated that their work was not only immensely enjoyable, it really made me feel for the victims of this real-life monster - so few serial killer movies bother with the victims, relegating them to meat puppets to be ripped apart in the most vulgar way possible. The horror component of the film is just barely surpassed by the humanity of the detective at the end, in truth it seemed the detective was himself battling Gacy for possession of his own soul throughout. When asked how he feels after the gruesome discovery is made he utters a single word which couldn't be surpassed in my opinion...'sad'.",5,One of the best movies of the 1990's,1142985600,"03 22, 2006",2006,2257,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'i', 'am', 'not', 'normally', 'fan', 'TV', 'movies', 'i', 'have', 'often', 'found', 'formulaic', 'bland', 'compromised', 'badly', 'acted', 'film', 'superbly', 'put', 'together', 'watching', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'pain', 'victims', 'famillies', 'director', 'took', 'great', 'pains', 'show', 'human', 'side', 'horrors', 'Gacy', 'inflicted', 'Chicago', 'face', 'sadness', 'detective', 'who', 'hunting', 'Gacy', 'abduction', 'murder', 'teenagers', 'see', 'deteriorating', 'mentally', 'film', 'often', 'crying', 'tears', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'simply', 'being', 'proximity', 'horror', 'investigation', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'Gacy', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Dennehy', 'whoever', 'cast', 'role', 'lot', 'credit', 'even', 'Gacy', 'Dennehy', 'massive', 'amount', 'unpleasantness', 'portrayal', 'sadistic', 'killer', 'when', 'teeth', 'biting', 'lower', 'lip', 'cops', 'get', 'measure', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'three', 'dimensional', 'monster', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'extraordinarily', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'matter', 'being', 'low', 'gore', 'overall', 'effect', 'completely', 'unsettling', 'incredibly', 'disturbing', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'horror', 'suggested', 'brilliantly', 'droning', 'noise', 'furnace', 'Gacy', 'house', 'puddles', 'filth', 'accumulating', 'surface', 'soil', 'crawlspace', 'house', 'where', 'bodies', 'are', 'buried', 'take', 'peek', 'hell', 'pacing', 'tension', 'film', 'maintained', 'well', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'three', 'hours', 'Again', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'congratulated', 'work', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'immensely', 'enjoyable', 'really', 'made', 'feel', 'victims', 'real-life', 'monster', 'so', 'few', 'serial', 'killer', 'movies', 'bother', 'victims', 'relegating', 'meat', 'puppets', 'be', 'ripped', 'apart', 'most', 'vulgar', 'way', 'possible', 'horror', 'component', 'film', 'just', 'barely', 'surpassed', 'humanity', 'detective', 'end', 'truth', 'seemed', 'detective', 'was', 'battling', 'Gacy', 'possession', 'own', 'soul', 'When', 'asked', 'how', 'gruesome', 'discovery', 'made', 'single', 'word', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'surpassed', 'opinion']",N/A
