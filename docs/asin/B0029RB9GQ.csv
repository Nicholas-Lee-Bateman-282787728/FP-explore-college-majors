But be warned, this is the series and nothing else.  No frills, no interviews, no bonus content whatsoever.  And truthfully the artwork on the box looks like something I'd expect on a bootleg.  Don't get me wrong, the episodes still look good, and the sound doesn't skip so if you were a fan of the series it is what you get.  I just think that for $30+ they could have given us more, at the very least better box art and making the video better.  That's the only reason this lost a star.  But beggars can't be choosers, and this series needed a collection made of it.",4,"Bare Bones, but still Bucky O'Hare",1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,703,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'wanting', 'series', 'ever', 'vhs', 'copies', 'finally', 'died', 'so', 'speak', 'truth', 'when', 'say', 'was', 'fantastic', 'find', 'be', 'warned', 'series', 'nothing', 'else', 'No', 'frills', 'interviews', 'bonus', 'content', 'whatsoever', 'truthfully', 'artwork', 'box', 'something', ""'d"", 'expect', 'bootleg', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'episodes', 'still', 'look', 'good', 'sound', ""n't"", 'skip', 'so', 'were', 'fan', 'series', 'what', 'get', 'just', 'think', '30+', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'very', 'least', 'better', 'box', 'art', 'making', 'video', 'better', 'only', 'reason', 'lost', 'star', 'beggars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'choosers', 'series', 'needed', 'collection', 'made']",Bucky O'Hare: The Complete Series (2 Disc Set)

And then it disappeared, and nobody ever talked about it again outside of &#34;oh yeah, that was the green rabbit show, right?&#34;Yes, the animation is dated, and no, it doesn't hold up to newer cartoons -- but with its unique story and its creative team, I'm really glad this series is finally getting the DVD release it deserves. There are no extras on this set, just the episodes of the show itself, but that's okay.

I remember watching this and enjoying the adventures of Bucky and his crew, and I really wish that the show had a more complete ending in dealing with the Toad Menace. It's cool that this show is now available on DVD.

It is a shame there was no bonus material or features on this DVD.  It is just each 23-25 minute, 13 episodes divided among 2 disc.  No captions or ability to skip half the show.  That means you have to fast forward or rewind if you want to see your favorite scene if it is in the 14-15 minute mark.  If you push the skip button, it skips to the next episode.  I just hope another company picks up this series and add some extras, or heck even reboot this series.  I remember vividly this cartoon was eye catching due to is war like nature and fights.  It stood out.  Why it didn't last longer then 1 season confuses me!
