The cover art riveted me, and I looked forward to seeing Ava Gardner as the smoldering temptress. Unfortunately, Gardner's character came across as sniveling and whiney. She appears to be immediately attracted to Clark Gable's character, but when he doesn't return her interest she becomes pouty and sullen. At least twice she ran away to cry, which would have been more understandable if she and Gable's character had ever communicated interest. I just wanted to shake her and say, ""You're a beautiful woman. Tons of men would want you. Move on!"" Her catty comments and continual attempts to get attention made her character reek of desperation and was quite unbecoming. She was not the strong female character that I am used to seeing in other classic movies. On top of that, I finally saw Red Dust, and there is just no comparison. Gardner does not hold a candle to Jean Harlow in this movie.Then there is Grace Kelly's character. She is plain, and her waffling is annoying. She is just... boring. She even looked boring. In her other movies, I've found her quite beautiful, but in this movie she looked a little washed-out. Overall, I couldn't really tell why Gable's character would want either of these women.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Gable's performance. It was interesting to compare to his earlier work in Red Dust. He had a youthful attractiveness in Red Dust that made it easy to see how he would be able to win over the women, and in Mogambo he seems to bring a sense of maturity to the role that changes the tone somewhat. Both performances were good. Additionally, the African scenery was beautiful.All in all, I would recommend seeing Red Dust above Mogambo, but this is not the review of a Red Dust fanatic poo-pooing the remake; these were the impressions I had before seeing Red Dust, and seeing that movie only confirmed it.

John Lee Mahin re-tooled his original screenplay, and Clark Gable returned to reprise his role of a rubber plantation owner (Dennis Carson in ""Red Dust"", but called Victor Marswell in the remake).Clark Gable's performamce is amazing.  How often does an actor have the opportunity of revisiting a character 20 years later, and use their maturity and experience to flesh out the role to a greater extent than they did before?  In ""Red Dust"", Gable was magnificent, but here in MOGAMBO, he is positively magnetic.Ava Gardner plays Eloise Kelly (`Honey Bear') who battles with crisp Linda Nordley (Grace Kelly) for the affections of Victor.  Gardner is more than a match for Jean Harlow; and Grace Kelly, in one of her first big important roles, is fantastic in the part originally taken by Mary Astor.  Filmed on location in Africa, director John Ford brings a lot more action and cinematic thrill to the story, but the central love-trilogy remains the focus.

Grace Kelly, as the married woman Linda, would steal every one's heart with her elegant beauty. But it was Ava Garner that shone brightly throughout the movie. She was Kelly, the American who fought fiercely, but clumsily and in vain, in her pursuit of Victor's love. She might lose to Linda but beneath her unforgiving remarks about Linda, she had a big and understanding heart. She helped Victor all along and stood up for Victor and Linda when Linda's husband began to suspect. Ava Garner was beautifully portrayed here, both under the camera and in the script. She had wit, courage and adapted well in the jungle. And there was chemistry between Gable and Gardner, whose vulnerable feelings were disguised by their professions and their strong characters.A thought provoking movie about sophisticated people and mature love.

This one is dynamite but, truthfully,  3 1/2 stars is more like it. This is  a corny potboiler ""movie movie"" where bridled loins and unbridled passion meet with great star power.  Grace Kelly is smokin' as the repressed English wife/marm of a sincere but dull Brit.  But Ava Garder as a brassy urban night-lifer dropped in the middle of East Africa to keep the party goin' steals the show.  Polar opposites, the two of them orbit around macho Clark Gable's big game hunter, everyone lusting for someone or something.  And since the grass is always greener and he is a hunter after all, Gable is less interested in Ava's easy virtue than Kelly's cool chastity.  John Ford rarely, if ever, did the romantic/sex thing to this extent (though John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara do steam it up in a few) but he goes the distance here.  Set in a sweaty dangerous jungle full of hot and humid eyes and bodies, and toss in a gorilla hunt for added symbolism.........good stuff.  Conformity of 1950s marriages are challenged here by Hollywood non-comformists so the general population didn't have to.  The trailer is hilarious for all the references to the smoldering African atmosphere.  Nothing to take seriously but well crafted period piece with mercurial John Ford at the helm.

282464,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6301971558,Douglas M,"[8, 10]","After the 2nd World War, Clark Gable was rarely able to recreate the excitement of so many of his thirties films. Not only was he ageing of course, but his biographers record that he never got over the loss of wife Carole Lombard in 1942. He was letting himself go. MGM, his home studio, clearly recognised the change and many of his postwar films are a trial. ""Mogambo,"" released in 1953, is a notable exception. John Ford filmed this action adventure and it is minor work in his canon, simply because the filming is straightforward and expert but with no particular Ford imprint.A remake of a previous success, the raunchy and funny ""Red Dust"" from 1932, Gable stars as an African game hunter on safari with 2 worthwhile leading ladies, the sensuous, amusing playgirl, Ava Gardner, and the icy, married Gracy Kelly. The plot is simple. Both woman fall for Gable and the melodrama revolves around how this plays out amongst lots of location shots of the scenary, native tribesmen and animals. Gable is perfectly cast as the macho hero and Gardner hits the right notes to make believable that she, 20 years his junior, would be his sort of woman. Kelly is much less successful and inferior to Mary Astor in the same role in the original film.

282465,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6301971558,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 7]","Ava Gardner could hardly be considered anyone's second choice, but this is what director John Ford and screenwriter John Lee Mahin would have you believe in this overripe 1952 safari melodrama. Yet, she is the primary reason why this film is still worth a look 56 years later. Far more intuitively than Angelina Jolie these days, Gardner epitomized a primal sensuality and a hidden vulnerability, the combination of which was intoxicating in her prime. Ford captures this, as well as her dark beauty and sharp comedy sense, by casting her as smart-mouthed, carefree playgirl Eloise ""Honey Bear"" Kelly, who has come to a remote African outpost to meet up with a wealthy maharajah. Finding herself stood up, she is greeted by no-nonsense big game hunter Victor Marswell as she conveniently takes a shower al fresco. Before sparks can truly fly, a young British anthropologist and his prudish wife, Donald and Linda Nordley, arrive naively drawn to the flora and fauna.Then a rather preposterous story turn occurs in which Marswell becomes smitten with Mrs. Nordley, and she with him since she swoons over the manly hunter over her milquetoast husband. Looking the patrician beauty that served her well during her brief movie career, a 24-year-old Grace Kelly plays Linda in typical melodramatic fashion. Her English accent is a bit overdone, and her character's motivations too simplistically presented for Kelly to shine, especially next to Gardner. As Marswell, the 52-year-old Clark Gable doesn't have quite the swagger he displayed so easily in his youth when he first played this role in 1932'sRed Dustwith Jean Harlow and Mary Astor in the Gardner and Kelly parts. However, it is a testament to his enduring appeal that he is at all convincing as a magnet for two much younger women.But make no mistake that Gable, who has to maintain a stoic, man-of-mystery demeanor as Marswell, really hands the picture to Gardner. In particular, she has a fetching couple of scenes where she sings Robert Burns' ""Comin' Through the Rye"" and seems truly to enjoy interacting with the wild animals. It's all a hoot, and the location filming in Kenya and Uganda really brings the story to vibrant life. Ford handles the exotic background as well as he does Monument Valley in his classic westerns, and he makes sure to keep goosing the story with action elements so that the focus is not completely on the love triangle. Industry veteran Robert Surtees and David Lean's favorite cameraman Freddie Young shared cinematography responsibilities, and the look of the film is sumptuous even by MGM's high standards.

What separates this film from others of the genre is, of course, John Ford. At the top of his game, Ford was known not only as a consummate story teller, but an expert in creating a ""visual universe"" for the viewer....the Africa he captures transports the viewer to that continent, the sights and sounds becoming part of the experience. Performances are uniformly excellent---particularly supporting actors, and, as always with a John Ford production, the storyline is compelling and fast-paced. Although references to natives as ""boys"" and the frequent portrayal of the slaughter of wild animals will make 21st century viewers cringe a bit, the story is superb and worth a second (even third viewing).....Ford was a genius, and this is his picture from beginning to end---to any John Ford fan, that pretty well sums it up.",4,John Ford's Africa,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,966,"['Mogambo', 'three', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'greatest', 'stars', 'Gable', 'Gardner', 'up-and-coming', 'Kelly', 'love', 'trilogy', 'set', 'Africa', 'What', 'film', 'others', 'genre', 'course', 'John', 'Ford', 'top', 'game', 'Ford', 'was', 'known', 'not', 'only', 'consummate', 'story', 'teller', 'expert', 'creating', 'visual', 'universe', 'viewer', '.the', 'Africa', 'viewer', 'continent', 'sights', 'sounds', 'becoming', 'part', 'experience', 'Performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', '-particularly', 'supporting', 'actors', 'always', 'John', 'Ford', 'production', 'storyline', 'compelling', 'fast-paced', 'references', 'natives', 'boys', 'frequent', 'portrayal', 'slaughter', 'wild', 'animals', 'will', 'make', '21st', 'century', 'viewers', 'cringe', 'bit', 'story', 'superb', 'second', 'even', 'third', 'viewing', '..Ford', 'was', 'genius', 'picture', 'beginning', 'end', '-to', 'John', 'Ford', 'fan', 'pretty', 'well', 'sums', 'up']",N/A

The photography is breathtaking and the plot likewise but predictable. But it doesn`t matter in the hands of these stars... there were a REASON they were stars and they carry if beautifully on their shoulders.Gable and Kelly`s romance was widely written about in 1953-1954 and while many says she was his 2nd Carole Lombard(the love of his life and tragically killed in a planecrash in 1942) others suggests it was a 1-nite-stand... However, Gable admired her immensely(being the outdoorman he was), especially when he found her crying between takes - asking her why she did so - she replied; ""I saw this lion walking by me here by the lake... and it was the most beautiful sight...""Yup, he felt she was a spunky girl. Miss Gardner revealed after Kelly`s death that the two girls walked by the natives and Gardner pulled out one of the men`s ............. and replied; ""Frank`s bigger than that!""(Frank Sinatra, her then husband) to a purple red shocked Grace Kelly.Kelly later recalled that they spent Xmas in Africa that year and that Sinatra bought presents for everyone and played the role of Santa Clause and even got John Ford to recite the Christmas Story.Ford was not to Kelly`s liking. At one point he shouted; ""Kelly - what the hell are you doing?""... She stammered something written in the script, to which he replied ""We`re shooting a picture, not a damn script...!""Well, back to the picture itself...A letdown are the gorilla scenes(obvious made in the studio, and the intercut no good)...

Both instantly find the macho man irresistible.I usually like these three stars a lot, but I didn't care much for this movie. Gable's character is a silly caricature of rugged manliness; he growls orders, drinks a lot, and grabs women too roughly. He was only 52, but looked much older and was past his Rhett Butler glory days. Kelly is good but seems to be trying oh-so-hard to be stern and matronly with much lip-pouting and overdoing the accent. Gardner plays her usual sexy, sadder-but-wiser part, but her dialogue is phony and stagy, her character overblown and never believable.While the animal-catching and scenes of marginalized natives are terribly out of fashion and off-putting, the location scenery is beautiful, especially filmed in brilliant Technicolor.

Of course, the great cast and the place where the story was filmed help, and a lot.This movie was directed by John Ford, and filmed in Africa. The plot is simple, but quite effective. Victor Marswell (Clark Gable) is a safari guide whose like is disrupted when a beautiful woman, Eloise Kelly (Ava Gardner), shows up at his camp, looking for a majarajah. Unfortunately for her, her ""acquaintance"" has left and she has to remain in the camp at least until the next boat arrives. Eloise starts to fall for Victor, and their attraction seems mutual, but not meant to be.However, things are further stirred up when a couple, Professor Donald Nordley (Donald Sinden) and his wife Linda (Grace Kelly) arrive to Victor?s complex for a safari. The problem is that now Eloise likes Victor, Victor is attracted to Linda, and Linda has feelings for Victor but is married to Donald, who is not aware of what is happening around him and is only interested in looking for gorillas.Of course, that situation is a good recipe for entertainment. Throw in a great scenery and some wild animals, and you have a very entertaining movie.

It's a non-musical produced by MGM, what can one expect? This is one of those old kinds of movies where the character development takes a backseat to the *breathtaking* scenery and atmosphere. Actually the scenery isn't so breathtaking (maybe in 1953 this would have blown your socks off, but come on, those of us in 2007 are much more world weary now). As usual, Ava and Grace flounce around the jungle in well decked out outfits and perfectly applied lipstick. This kind of reminded me a bit of 1954's ""Elephant Walk"" with Elizabeth Taylor: both movies are over the top melodramatic with special effects that are extremely lame by today's standards. The focus on scenery, costumes, shooting on location, and special effects causes the character development to suffer. Honestly, ""Mogambo"" gets a bit boring at times with all of its scenery shots. I think ""Elephant Walk"" had more of an interesting story, and that's not saying much. I'm puzzled as to why Ava and Grace were nominated Oscars for this movie. I love these two actresses, but ""Mogambo"" is a throw away filler movie Ava made (sadly like much of her career) and for Grace is was just something she needed to allow her new film career to take flight. Oh and Clark Gable in this? He seems tired, bored, and worn out. Not to mention he's way too old!

If anything, it feels more like a middling Richard Thorpe or Jack Conway film, but either way it's pure MGM all the way- a well-cooked steak, but no sizzle.The transfer is good, though there are a few inconsistencies due to the master material available.
