1657009,AXTLK9RYC8FPL,B00DK3J1SQ,Customer,"[0, 29]",I am surprised that these people think they can sell this crappy series for this price. The reason it is crappy is because there is practically no action. I almost fell asleep during most of the episodes because they were so boring. Also this series is horribly written and pure cheese. Don't waste your money on this crap.,1,98 dollars for this crap,1382486400,"10 23, 2013",2013,323,"['am', 'surprised', 'people', 'think', 'can', 'sell', 'crappy', 'series', 'price', 'reason', 'crappy', 'practically', 'action', 'almost', 'fell', 'asleep', 'most', 'episodes', 'were', 'so', 'boring', 'Also', 'series', 'horribly', 'written', 'pure', 'cheese', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'crap']",Blue Exorcist DVD Complete First Season

Hamilton,"[2, 2]","This is a great show but for the fact that they are gouging you on the PRICE I had to knock off a half of a point(my score is 4.50) by the way I looked on rightstuf.com,that are just as high :-(. I think you have 4 options 1 pay the price(if you have the money )2 wait until they drop the price.3. Use the amazon instant vedeo (you get the shows for a third of the price)4. If you have a game console you can buy it that way(that is what I am doing) if you do it that way it cost about $45 . But I really love the show!",4,I would give a 5 if for....,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,519,"['great', 'show', 'fact', 'are', 'gouging', 'PRICE', 'had', 'knock', 'off', 'half', 'point', 'score', '4.50', 'way', 'looked', 'rightstuf.com', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'high', 'think', 'have', '4', 'options', '1', 'pay', 'price', 'have', 'money', '2', 'wait', 'drop', 'price.3', 'Use', 'amazon', 'instant', 'vedeo', 'get', 'shows', 'third', 'price', '4', 'have', 'game', 'console', 'can', 'buy', 'way', 'what', 'am', 'doing', 'do', 'way', 'cost', '45', 'really', 'love', 'show']",Blue Exorcist DVD Complete First Season

It's about a boy who turns out to be the son of Satan, and he gets mixxed up in all sorts of stuff trying to avenge his mentor's death by training to fight his own father.bsolutely appalling that Aniplex feels they have to gouge fans charging $98 for HALF a series. Almost $10 per episode??? Please Aniplex, get your greedy head out of your posterior and re-release this and other series like Durarara in an affordable format! Til then, my friends and I will buy from other distributors and continue to watch Aniplex series online only.",2,"Good Series, TERRIBLE price",1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,562,"['Enjoyable', 'fun', 'series', 'boy', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'son', 'Satan', 'mixxed', 'up', 'sorts', 'stuff', 'trying', 'avenge', 'mentor', 'death', 'training', 'fight', 'own', 'father.bsolutely', 'appalling', 'Aniplex', 'feels', 'have', 'gouge', 'fans', 'charging', '98', 'HALF', 'series', 'Almost', '10', 'episode', 'Please', 'Aniplex', 'get', 'greedy', 'head', 'posterior', 're-release', 'other', 'series', 'Durarara', 'affordable', 'format', 'Til', 'then', 'friends', 'will', 'buy', 'other', 'distributors', 'continue', 'watch', 'Aniplex', 'series', 'online', 'only']",Blue Exorcist DVD Complete First Season
