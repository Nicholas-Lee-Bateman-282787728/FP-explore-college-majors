500228,A3PJJAH488L3ZC,B00000FELC,"Alice M. Grove ""The Little Harpist""","[5, 5]","PBS created this wonderful production about Martha Ballard from the book of the same name. Martha Ballard's story is intertwined with the historical detective work of a modern day historian who was working with Martha's personal journal.We all know about Benjamin Franklin, Abigail Adams, George Washington. However, ""A Midwife's Tale"" is about an ordinary citizen.  Se was a wife, a mother, a caregiver, a citizen of a young country.  We only know about her because she kept a detailed journal about her life and those around her.  She attended over 1,000 women when they gave birth and never lost a mother. She tended to the sick. She grew her own herbs which were used as medication. She was a midwife, a doctor, a nurse and a pharmacist but never viewed herself as a hero.As I watched this DVD I grew to know Martha Ballard and to respect her.  I watched it again and and again was left with many thoughts about her.  Our history is fraught with so many unsung heros like Martha Ballard whose story need to be told.PBS did not make an effort to glamorize her story--costuming was true to her era; a minimum of make-up seemes to have been used; her home was simple and was shown as such.  This is a fascinating story about an ordinary woman and it is done beatifully.",5,History Brought to Life,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,1270,"['PBS', 'created', 'wonderful', 'production', 'Martha', 'Ballard', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Martha', 'Ballard', 'story', 'intertwined', 'historical', 'detective', 'work', 'modern', 'day', 'historian', 'who', 'was', 'working', 'Martha', 'personal', 'journal.We', 'know', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'George', 'Washington', 'However', 'Midwife', 'Tale', 'ordinary', 'citizen', 'Se', 'was', 'wife', 'mother', 'caregiver', 'citizen', 'young', 'country', 'only', 'know', 'kept', 'detailed', 'journal', 'life', 'attended', 'over', '1,000', 'women', 'when', 'gave', 'birth', 'never', 'lost', 'mother', 'tended', 'sick', 'grew', 'own', 'herbs', 'were', 'used', 'medication', 'was', 'midwife', 'doctor', 'nurse', 'pharmacist', 'never', 'viewed', 'hero.As', 'watched', 'DVD', 'grew', 'know', 'Martha', 'Ballard', 'respect', 'watched', 'again', 'again', 'was', 'left', 'many', 'thoughts', 'history', 'fraught', 'so', 'many', 'unsung', 'heros', 'Martha', 'Ballard', 'story', 'need', 'be', 'told.PBS', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'effort', 'glamorize', 'story', 'costuming', 'was', 'true', 'era', 'minimum', 'make-up', 'seemes', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'home', 'was', 'simple', 'was', 'shown', 'such', 'fascinating', 'story', 'ordinary', 'woman', 'done', 'beatifully']","Midwife's Tale, A VHS"

500230,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B00000FELC,Jeffery Mingo,"[9, 48]","This was REALLY only meant for people that like recreating the past.  Remember when Oprah attempted life as a woman in the 1700s?  Civil War recreationists would like this too.  Still, this is completely a niche market.  Remember how the Simpsons tried a show like this and the show got cancelled?  I was sitting here bored watching a show that implies ""Wasn't eighteenth century life so interesting and admirable?""  This is 90 minutes on one historian speaking on one historical document.  I appreciate this as a contribution to women's studies.  But otherwise, yawn!This does mention spicy topics such as premarital sex and rape allegations.  The historian can document health epidemics and property boundaries.  Still, I would have like to seen this midwife's life contextualized.  For example, how and when did she learn to read and write?  I imagine most women in the 1700s did not have those skills.  The work suggests that the midwife was not stigmatized for her job and made good money from it, so why didn't she pass this trade on to her own daughters?  The work does show her tracking in snow.  Still, Maine, to this day, is icy cold.  Did she smoke meat?  How did her family and other family survive during long, oppressive winters?  Each woman and girl here always has her hair covered.  I imagine this was in order not to catch or spread lice, but the work never says.  When the midwife dies, her children and grandchildren are at her bedside.  I heard this was a common practice back then, but the documentary never says.  The historian notes that the midwife recorded her tasks and not her feelings.  Is this an example of the Protestant work ethic?  Again, things should have been fleshed out.Again, do not view this if you aren't in the targeted niche.",2,For Those Who Worship the Past,1151193600,"06 25, 2006",2006,1769,"['was', 'REALLY', 'only', 'meant', 'people', 'recreating', 'past', 'Remember', 'when', 'Oprah', 'attempted', 'life', 'woman', '1700s', 'Civil', 'War', 'recreationists', 'would', 'like', 'too', 'Still', 'completely', 'niche', 'market', 'Remember', 'how', 'Simpsons', 'tried', 'show', 'show', 'got', 'cancelled', 'was', 'sitting', 'here', 'bored', 'watching', 'show', 'Was', ""n't"", 'eighteenth', 'century', 'life', 'interesting', 'admirable', '90', 'minutes', 'one', 'historian', 'speaking', 'one', 'historical', 'document', 'appreciate', 'contribution', 'women', 'studies', 'otherwise', 'yawn', 'mention', 'spicy', 'topics', 'such', 'premarital', 'sex', 'rape', 'allegations', 'historian', 'can', 'document', 'health', 'epidemics', 'property', 'boundaries', 'Still', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'midwife', 'life', 'contextualized', 'example', 'how', 'when', 'did', 'learn', 'read', 'write', 'imagine', 'most', 'women', '1700s', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'skills', 'work', 'midwife', 'was', 'not', 'stigmatized', 'job', 'made', 'good', 'money', 'so', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'pass', 'trade', 'own', 'daughters', 'work', 'show', 'tracking', 'snow', 'Still', 'Maine', 'day', 'icy', 'cold', 'Did', 'smoke', 'meat', 'How', 'did', 'family', 'other', 'family', 'survive', 'long', 'oppressive', 'winters', 'woman', 'girl', 'here', 'always', 'hair', 'covered', 'imagine', 'was', 'order', 'not', 'catch', 'spread', 'lice', 'work', 'never', 'When', 'midwife', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'are', 'bedside', 'heard', 'was', 'common', 'practice', 'back', 'then', 'documentary', 'never', 'historian', 'notes', 'midwife', 'recorded', 'tasks', 'not', 'feelings', 'example', 'Protestant', 'work', 'ethic', 'Again', 'things', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out.Again', 'do', 'not', 'view', 'are', ""n't"", 'targeted', 'niche']","Midwife's Tale, A VHS"

Like the great bard said, The world is a stage and we are all but actors upon it.And this film based on the research and reading of one woman's diary is really quite interesting.It is the story of a midwife. It begins after the American revolution and through it we travel through time to her world to visit. We meet her husband. We meet some of her offspring. But best of all we meet her world.Nicely re-enacted. Nicely done. Well researched. A must for anyone interested in the time period.",5,Her story,1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,631,"['Not', 'history', 'cannons', 'muskets', 'truth', 'most', 'history', 'not', 'many', 'parts', 'really', 'quite', 'boring', 'everything', 'place', 'great', 'bard', 'said', 'world', 'stage', 'are', 'actors', 'it.And', 'film', 'based', 'research', 'reading', 'one', 'woman', 'diary', 'really', 'quite', 'interesting.It', 'story', 'midwife', 'American', 'revolution', 'travel', 'time', 'world', 'visit', 'meet', 'husband', 'meet', 'offspring', 'best', 'meet', 'world.Nicely', 're-enacted', 'Nicely', 'done', 'Well', 'researched', 'must', 'anyone', 'interested', 'time', 'period']","Midwife's Tale, A VHS"

I very nearly turned it off because the first 15 minutes were boring and slow.  But once they got past the yada, yada, yada and into this woman's life story, it was completely enthralling.I watched it a second time with the family, fast forwarding past the boring introduction.  The fam also found it very interesting.The movie is kind of a docu-drama, recreated from the detailed diary of a 1780's midwife.  The details about life back then are just beyond description.One tidbit - premarital sex wasn't the scandal that we'd expect in those times.  However, a woman would be asked, in the throes on intense labor, to name the father of the baby.  The woman's testimony during these intense moments was considered solid and incontrovertible.  If the baby's father refused to marry the woman, THAT was scandalous.This movie was filled with those kind of details.  I can't recommend this VHS-tape enough.  One of the best movies I think I've ever seen.",5,"After the first 15 minutes, it gets FANTASTIC!!!",991353600,"06 1, 2001",2001,1027,"['When', 'watched', 'VHS', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'very', 'nearly', 'turned', 'off', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'were', 'boring', 'slow', 'once', 'got', 'yada', 'yada', 'yada', 'woman', 'life', 'story', 'was', 'completely', 'enthralling.I', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'family', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'boring', 'introduction', 'fam', 'also', 'found', 'very', 'interesting.The', 'movie', 'kind', 'docu-drama', 'recreated', 'detailed', 'diary', '1780', 'midwife', 'details', 'life', 'back', 'then', 'are', 'just', 'description.One', 'tidbit', 'premarital', 'sex', 'was', ""n't"", 'scandal', ""'d"", 'expect', 'times', 'However', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'asked', 'throes', 'intense', 'labor', 'name', 'father', 'baby', 'woman', 'testimony', 'intense', 'moments', 'was', 'considered', 'solid', 'incontrovertible', 'baby', 'father', 'refused', 'marry', 'woman', 'THAT', 'was', 'scandalous.This', 'movie', 'was', 'filled', 'kind', 'details', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'VHS-tape', 'enough', 'One', 'best', 'movies', 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']","Midwife's Tale, A VHS"
