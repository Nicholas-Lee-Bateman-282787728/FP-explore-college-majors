357577,ATJ2K0ABQUKHX,6303112102,"Chris Lockwood ""LockwoodLetter.com""","[3, 3]","Tommy Lee Jones, in one of his first starring roles, plays eccentric billionaire aviator/moviemaker Hughes in this abridged version of a TV miniseries released a year after Hughes died. (I haven't seen the original, which is not available on video, so I'm reviewing this version as presented on DVD.)The movie covers the span of Hughes' lifetime, from early scenes of his youth right through his end as the world's most famous hermit and germophobe. The story jumps around between Hughes' adventures in aviation, film, and other businesses. These intertwine in a segment showing the making of Hell's Angels a movie set in World War I, directed by Hughes and finally released in 1930. Hughes can't get any of his pilots to perform a dangerous scene close to the ground, so he does it himself with disastrous results.Several famous actresses such as Jean Harlow, Katherine Hepburn, and Jane Russell, who had dealings with Hughes, are portrayed here. The film was based on the 1972 book Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes, by Noah Dietrich, one of Hughes' top assistants, who is played by Ed Flanders. (Not the guy from The Simpsons.)Among the other flying scenes is Hughes testing the Spruce Goose, the famously impractical eight-engine wooden airplane with a 320-foot wingspan that barely flew. Also depicted are Hughes and his crew making one of the first around-the-world flights and his exploits running a major airline.",3,"Good, but abridged, biography of Howard Hughes",1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,1418,"['Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'one', 'first', 'starring', 'roles', 'plays', 'eccentric', 'billionaire', 'aviator/moviemaker', 'Hughes', 'abridged', 'version', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'released', 'year', 'Hughes', 'died', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'not', 'available', 'video', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'version', 'presented', 'DVD', 'movie', 'span', 'Hughes', 'lifetime', 'early', 'scenes', 'youth', 'right', 'end', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'hermit', 'germophobe', 'story', 'Hughes', 'adventures', 'aviation', 'film', 'other', 'businesses', 'intertwine', 'segment', 'showing', 'making', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'movie', 'set', 'World', 'War', 'directed', 'Hughes', 'finally', 'released', '1930', 'Hughes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'pilots', 'perform', 'dangerous', 'scene', 'close', 'ground', 'disastrous', 'results.Several', 'famous', 'actresses', 'such', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Jane', 'Russell', 'who', 'had', 'dealings', 'Hughes', 'are', 'portrayed', 'here', 'film', 'was', 'based', '1972', 'book', 'Howard', 'Amazing', 'Mr.', 'Hughes', 'Noah', 'Dietrich', 'one', 'Hughes', 'top', 'assistants', 'who', 'played', 'Ed', 'Flanders', 'Not', 'guy', 'Simpsons', 'other', 'flying', 'scenes', 'Hughes', 'testing', 'Spruce', 'Goose', 'famously', 'impractical', 'eight-engine', 'wooden', 'airplane', '320-foot', 'wingspan', 'barely', 'flew', 'Also', 'depicted', 'are', 'Hughes', 'crew', 'making', 'one', 'first', 'around-the-world', 'flights', 'exploits', 'running', 'major', 'airline']",N/A

Especially with an $80.00 price tag on it.Through further research, I discovered that this was originally a 2 part, made for television mini-series which aired on CBS in 1977. I had also discovered references of this being an HBO acquisition from CBS at some point in time.Originally airing at 215 minutes long, this DVD had been cut up, (or down) to 123 minutes. Surely not a true representation of the original mini-series.'Someone' out there has the current rights to re-release this mini-series, and in it's entirety. Obviously there is a market for it, and I will contact CBS, HBO or whoever has those rights currently, and inquire about a new release of the original full length mini-series.Not some cut up version of it, that some studio that secures temporary rights to produce a DVD, made an abortion out of.",1,Ah...
