294125,A2KWG1J285Z4QA,6302077729,David Baltazar,"[6, 6]","This review is from:Microwave MassacreThis movie so funny despite it being so bad! Jackie Vernon who was also the voice actor for ""Frostie the Snowman"" is very memorable in this classic B-rated horror flick. Glad to hear it's coming out on DVD because I lost my VHS copy of it. In a nutshell the movie is about a hard luck, construction worker with a very displeasing wife who finally pushes him over the edge to murder and the discovery of canabilism. He brings his wife's dead meat to his construction worker pals for lunch & they like it with mixed results. Later he continues to murder more victims for their flesh (mostly very attractive females) and he continues to get more praise from his construction pals for the great tasting meat that continues to get tastier. I'ts humorous to see him re-arrange his overcrowded frige of dead meat with his wife's head that he keeps for sentimental reasons. The canabilism novelty in this movie is a little sick but overall the movie is pretty funny. Very sexy women with some gratuditious nudity to keep the guys amused. Might be more difficult for women to enjoy this movie. A 1 star movie, but I always have a 4 star time watching it.

294128,A1FG91CM8221X1,6302077729,Miles D. Moore,"[9, 13]","Microwave Massacre is even worse than it sounds. It is cheap, sleazy soft-core porn masquerading as horror comedy, starring Jackie Vernon as a construction worker who kills and eats his nagging wife, then goes on a cannibalistic rampage. The special effects make Ed Wood look like George Lucas, most of the acting makes Tor Johnson look like Anthony Hopkins, and the whole thing is unbearably long at 75 minutes. Its only point of interest--and its tragedy--is Vernon, a hilarious deadpan comedian and the TV voice of Frosty the Snowman. Vernon was bankrupt and penniless toward the end of his life, and desperate for any work he could get; Microwave Massacre demonstrates just how desperate he was. But there is one moment in the film when Vernon showed he still had what it took. In that scene, his wife screams at him from the other room to wipe his feet; Vernon, with a look of consummate disgust that would have done credit to Oliver Hardy, steps up on the sofa and wipes his feet on the cushions.
