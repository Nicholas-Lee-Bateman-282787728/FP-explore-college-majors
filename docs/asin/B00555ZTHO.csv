1442294,A51IK68MWKV5R,B00555ZTHO,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[13, 14]","Fans of Max Allan Collins's Quarry character have been waiting for a movie starring their favorite hired killer since he debuted in the 1970s. It took thirty years, but it's worth it. The Last Lullaby is here, and it's definitely a Quarry film, though the lead character isn't named ""Quarry"" (Collins wants to retain the rights to the name, so filmmakers can't make ""sequels"" without his input).Retired killer Price (Tom Sizemore), on one of a string of sleepless nights, drives to a nearby convenience store and follows two suspicious characters to a kidnapping site, where he rescues the victim ... sort of. Six months later, he's offered $1 million for one last job: kill a librarian with ex-boyfriend troubles. But he gets emotionally involved, which puts them both in danger.Collins's Quarry short story ""A Matter of Principal"" (upon which the first part of The Last Lullaby is based) was made into a short film by director Jeffrey Goodman. (This short film is available on the DVD Shades of Noir, available in the Max Allan Collins's Black Box DVD set.) Collins liked the short so much, he allowed Goodman to expand it into a feature, provided Collins was involved in the scripting.An early draft of Collins's initial script was novelized by the author and published as part of the Hard Case Crime line as The Last Quarry. Readers of that novel will find a similar tone and characters but some significant differences made in turning the story into a mainstream (if independent) film. For example, co-screenwriter Peter Biegen was brought in to punch up the love story. (Collins's novelized version is much tougher.)What really makes The Last Lullaby work, however, are the lead performances by Sizemore and Sasha Alexander, who plays the librarian. Tom Sizemore's stony countenance betrays selective emotions, letting his eyes do the acting. And Sasha Alexander is an intelligent beauty with her own secrets.A veteran of mostly television work, Alexander (Rizzoli and Isles) holds her own opposite Sizemore, and one hopes that The Last Lullaby allows her to possibly break out from the small screen. Goodman understands human drama and the complexities of male-female relationships and lets this carry the viewer along as events conspire against the couple.Sizemore gets to show his tender side as one half of a potential couple of loners who aren't young anymore and really want to impress each other. Both actors bring incredible sexual magnetism. At the same time, it's sweet to see a romance between two such people treated with realism and delicacy, making The Last Lullaby a surprisingly good option for a date movie, even given its unremittingly dark storyline.",5,Great showcase for Sizemore and Alexander,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,2675,"['Fans', 'Max', 'Allan', 'Collins', 'Quarry', 'character', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'movie', 'starring', 'favorite', 'hired', 'killer', 'debuted', '1970s', 'took', 'thirty', 'years', 'Last', 'Lullaby', 'here', 'definitely', 'Quarry', 'film', 'lead', 'character', ""n't"", 'named', 'Quarry', 'Collins', 'retain', 'rights', 'name', 'filmmakers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'sequels', 'input', '.Retired', 'killer', 'Price', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'one', 'string', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'drives', 'nearby', 'convenience', 'store', 'two', 'suspicious', 'characters', 'kidnapping', 'site', 'where', 'victim', 'sort', 'Six', 'months', 'later', 'offered', '1', 'million', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'kill', 'librarian', 'ex-boyfriend', 'troubles', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'danger.Collins', 'Quarry', 'short', 'story', 'Matter', 'Principal', 'first', 'part', 'Last', 'Lullaby', 'based', 'was', 'made', 'short', 'film', 'director', 'Jeffrey', 'Goodman', 'short', 'film', 'available', 'DVD', 'Shades', 'Noir', 'available', 'Max', 'Allan', 'Collins', 'Black', 'Box', 'DVD', 'set', 'liked', 'short', 'so', 'much', 'allowed', 'Goodman', 'expand', 'feature', 'provided', 'Collins', 'was', 'involved', 'scripting.An', 'early', 'draft', 'Collins', 'initial', 'script', 'was', 'novelized', 'author', 'published', 'part', 'Hard', 'Case', 'Crime', 'line', 'Last', 'Quarry', 'Readers', 'novel', 'will', 'find', 'similar', 'tone', 'characters', 'significant', 'differences', 'made', 'turning', 'story', 'mainstream', 'independent', 'film', 'example', 'co-screenwriter', 'Peter', 'Biegen', 'was', 'brought', 'punch', 'up', 'love', 'story', 'Collins', 'novelized', 'version', 'much', 'tougher', 'What', 'really', 'Last', 'Lullaby', 'work', 'however', 'are', 'lead', 'performances', 'Sizemore', 'Sasha', 'Alexander', 'who', 'librarian', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'stony', 'countenance', 'betrays', 'selective', 'emotions', 'letting', 'eyes', 'do', 'acting', 'Sasha', 'Alexander', 'intelligent', 'beauty', 'own', 'secrets.A', 'veteran', 'mostly', 'television', 'work', 'Alexander', 'Rizzoli', 'Isles', 'own', 'opposite', 'Sizemore', 'one', 'Last', 'Lullaby', 'possibly', 'break', 'out', 'small', 'screen', 'Goodman', 'human', 'drama', 'complexities', 'male-female', 'relationships', 'viewer', 'events', 'conspire', 'couple.Sizemore', 'show', 'tender', 'side', 'one', 'half', 'potential', 'couple', 'loners', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'young', 'anymore', 'really', 'want', 'impress', 'other', 'actors', 'bring', 'incredible', 'sexual', 'magnetism', 'same', 'time', 'sweet', 'see', 'romance', 'two', 'such', 'people', 'treated', 'realism', 'delicacy', 'making', 'Last', 'Lullaby', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'option', 'date', 'movie', 'even', 'given', 'unremittingly', 'dark', 'storyline']",The Last Lullaby

Was quickly wrapped up in the story of an ex-hit man who gets roped back into his old way of life to carry out one more job.

I have maybe 30 or so films that I use as my &#34;go tos&#34; when I am in the mood to watch something but don't feel like searching through dozens of titles. I know them all by heart but I still enjoy watching them. This movie is now in that group.Sizemore is great as the aging hit man who is reconsidering his life. Alexander is beautiful and does an excellent job also as a woman living in fear. The performances are a bit underplayed and I like that. The use of the town of Minden LA is fantastic and the cinematography is quite good.The lower budget forces the director to use real locations which I find far more satisfying than elaborate sets that just don't ring true. The secondary players are all decent and you believe they sort of belong in the location. In other words they don't come off like a bunch of actors from all over just plopped into some city they don't know anything about.The ending is satisfying but still leaves you wondering what happens to the main characters after the final scene of the movie.

1442297,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00555ZTHO,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 3]","I have no idea where this movie came from. I don't remember the title or if it received a theatrical release but it was a joy to watch.Here's the scoop. Tom Sizemore plays Price, a contract hit man, whose conscience is catching up with him. He cannot sleep and walks around in a constant twilight. He takes on a job to kill a young woman, Sarah (played by Sasha Alexander), who he ends up falling for. So what's a hit man supposed to do in a situation like this?This is not a new plot line. What this movie has going for it is the way the story plays out and the performances. I like Sizemore. I think he has a natural ability on screen. And though he may not be the best actor around he does a fine job here. He walks around in a near daze and he can't keep his eyes open past half way, but he knows his craft. He's smart. He's always a step ahead of a given situation. Sasha Alexander is good as Sarah. She's young, bright and lovely. She has a good sense of humor, but she's troubled. Like Price, she has a hard time sleeping at night. There's a lovely pain watching these two draw closer to one another. So why is she on a hit list? You don't find out until the third act and I liked how that worked.This is shot in norther Louisiana and it has a good look. It's shot in a way to bolster the sense of loneliness and weariness felt by the two main characters. All the production values are good enough so the viewer doesn't see the bones. This is just an all over good watch. You may disagree with the ending. I don't know if I thought it was great, but I didn't mind it at all.If you're at all predisposed toward this sort of movie this is well worth your time.",4,What a Find.

Too bad, because Sizemore is great when directed well, but Goodman has a long way to go before creating a film that really jells. And Alexander needs to take a few drinks or smoke a doobie or something, I mean, come on, babe, loosen up, huh?So, what's wrong with the film? It's disjointed. It fights itself and each scene negates the last. All poor Sizemore does is shoot, sulk, skulk and shuffle around like a street drunk. Fifteen minutes is spent to tell us Sizemore can't sleep. That's fourteen minutes too many.Never do the characters seem to see what's right in front of them or even hear their own dialog.  Alexander asks: ""Where's the dog?"" and Goodman won't ever let her find out. Poor doggy.The dialog is shhhhhhhhh... quiet, then a gun goes off and BANG!!! your speakers blow. Note to Goodman: That ain't drama. It's annoying.Sizemore is a sissy toy salesman who can't shoot then turns into a chef's knife throwing ninja who murders a guy on her lawn and she doesn't even notice. HUH???They find her sister dead and then tra la la, they go for a drive. WTF?The Big Bad Dad admits murdering her mom? Didn't he learn anything from Slick Willy or Shrub? Deny deny deny.Alexander is a crack shot but never even touches a gun, let alone kills her dad herself. Has Goodman read his own script? Does he purposely avoid using his own characters details to develop the plot?There was absolutely NO chemistry between those poor actors. Did they hate each other? Were they both on Haldol? Were they gay? They're in the pool together and Alexander is looking like she wants to be grabbed and Sizemore looks like he has cramps. C'mon, Bill, Alexander ain't that bad. Fake it, dude.And why were we supposed to care about any of these sick, lost, brutal, nearly comatose people? Can Goodman give one good reason?I mean, the woman's just as sick as the hit man is.The lesson here for Goodman is that a bad script doesn't miraculously turn into a good film just because Sizemore swaggers around in it.Oh yeah, that reminds me: Where's the dog?",1,Please....

Personality wise he is dry and realizes he is not a social butterfly. He saves the daughter (Sprague Grayden) of a millionaire (Bill Smitrovich) only to ransom her himself. Months later, needing a hitman, our millionaire manages to find Price and make him an offer he can't refuse: one million dollars to kill Sarah (Sasha Alexander), a nice pretty librarian in a small town called Homewood.Neither we nor Price knows why he wants her dead. It is a mystery that we find out about midway...but too late. Price has already saved her twice from attackers and has grown fond of the librarian.
