284738,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630197350X,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The tale told in &#8216;The Picture of Dorian Gray&#8217; is quite chilling.  A man basically sells his soul in order to live a life of corruption, never aging while he wreaks havoc on the lives of others, all the while a portrait of him ages with disgusting attributes thanks to his dastardly ways.  He leaves in his wake broken hearts and murder, deception and vile contemptuousness until the day comes when he can bear no more.  His heart has been reached, but it is too late; or is it?While I don&#8217;t think the film captured the true nature of Dorian&#8217;s wickedness (censors I&#8217;m sure played a part in that), the film is effectively chilling and the performances by the entire cast (especially a heartbroken Angela Lansbury) help propel the film forward and make it all the more alluring and effective.  The crisp cinematography is unforgettable, using the black and while atmosphere to create true dread, and while I find the Technicolor portrait to be unnecessary (and inconsistent) it makes for a startling image at the film&#8217;s climax.Lansbury is the MVP here, using very short screen time to create an unforgettable damsel (and that voice) and George Sanders proved his weight as a prime supporting presence just five years before he took the Oscar for his tremendous performance in &#8216;All About Eve&#8217;.With a sensational score and a moral that will leave you aching, &#8216;The Picture of Dorian Gray&#8217; is a film not to be missed and an experience of a film.",4,A chilling portrait of a life astray&#8230;,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,1498,"['tale', 'told', '8216', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', '8217', 'quite', 'chilling', 'man', 'basically', 'soul', 'order', 'live', 'life', 'corruption', 'never', 'aging', 'havoc', 'lives', 'others', 'portrait', 'disgusting', 'attributes', 'thanks', 'dastardly', 'ways', 'wake', 'broken', 'hearts', 'murder', 'deception', 'vile', 'contemptuousness', 'day', 'when', 'can', 'bear', 'more', 'heart', 'been', 'reached', 'too', 'late', 'don', '8217', 'think', 'film', 'captured', 'true', 'nature', 'Dorian', '8217', 'wickedness', 'censors', '8217', 'sure', 'played', 'part', 'film', 'effectively', 'chilling', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'especially', 'heartbroken', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'help', 'propel', 'film', 'forward', 'make', 'more', 'alluring', 'effective', 'crisp', 'cinematography', 'unforgettable', 'using', 'black', 'atmosphere', 'create', 'true', 'dread', 'find', 'Technicolor', 'portrait', 'be', 'unnecessary', 'inconsistent', 'startling', 'image', 'film', '8217', 's', 'climax.Lansbury', 'MVP', 'here', 'using', 'very', 'short', 'screen', 'time', 'create', 'unforgettable', 'damsel', 'voice', 'George', 'Sanders', 'proved', 'weight', 'prime', 'supporting', 'presence', 'just', 'five', 'years', 'took', 'Oscar', 'tremendous', 'performance', '8216', 'Eve', '8217', 'sensational', 'score', 'moral', 'will', 'leave', 'aching', '8216', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', '8217', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'experience', 'film']",N/A

284744,A1YB29BIDULEYE,630197350X,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[8, 8]","With the exception of the fact that Sybil Vane is reduced from a stage actress to a club singer, this movie actually holds to the book quite well. In an age where horror movies revolve around the absurd overuse of blood and effects, and evil is portrayed as someone who just carries the label and dresses in black, this movie carries the true meaning of evil and terror. (Notably lost in modern times!)As in the book, we meet Lord Henry (played most convincingly by George Sanders). While he does have some redeeming points, he basically represents the devil. He is more of an observer, and he considers the common behavior of people beneath him. And as comically vicious as he gets, like the devil he never really tells outright falsehoods. One perfect example is when he expresses that women represent morality over mind and men represent mind over morals.Well, we then meet the young Dorian who is having his portrait painted. Lord Henry plays the devil and tells Dorian youth is only temporary and even if unintentionally tempts and leads Dorian into making a pact with evil. (He'll remain young while the picture ages.) Dorian then falls in love with Sybil Vane. And they plan to marry. But Lord Henry again plays the devil and gives Dorian advice that SOUNDS good, but will lead to Sybil's death when carried through. (Like the devil, Lord Henry can tempt, but NOT FORCE Dorian to do anything!) After Sybil's death, Lord Henry shows a redeeming moment when he is concerned over Dorian. But the harm is done. Dorian is now on his way to degeneration. It is not the pact itself that leads to Dorian's degeneration, but his vanity that leads him to a cold indifference to the needs of others. (While this behavior was comical in Lord Henry, it appears quite disturbing in Dorian.)Without blood or effects, this movie is really scarey as we gradually see Dorian degenerate into evil. Despite what action movies tell us, the true meaning of evil is when we become a prisoner of our own vanity and we desire to satisfy ourselves no matter what the cost to others. Dorian makes this clear when he says: ""I enjoy scandals about others, but scandals about me do not interest me. I find them boring."" In a moment of disturbing terror, Dorian murders the uncle of the Gladys (whom he now loves). And in his arguably most evil moment, he becomes the tempter. While he asks for Alan Campbell's help in disposing of the body, he tempts but again doesn't force. (And this will lead to Campbell's suicide. The tempted has become the tempter!)But Sybil's brother is still out there and he wants revenge for the death of his sister. We heard of Adrian Singleton earlier when Basil expressed his fear over the degeneration of Dorian's friends, and we see him as a disturbing eccentric who interestingly carries reason. Jim's death is creepily ambiguous. Did Dorian set up the hunting party in hopes that Jim would walk into a bullet, or did Jim's desire for revenge lead to his downfall? We don't know, but we DO know that for this evil to have fallen on Jim, Jim had to consent at least in part to it when he persued the evils of revenge. (Something the utterly stupid 'Time to Kill' couldn't figure out.)Moving on, Dorian has defeated all his enemies, but he just can't live with himself anymore. (An ending above and beyond action movies that have a hero kill his enemies, fall in love, and live happily ever after!) Well, Dorian breaks his pact with evil and pays a HIGH price. Not only is this movie a phenomenal remake of the book itself, but it also reminds us of the REAL meaning of evil and terror. And as a bonus, it shows the shortcomings of modern movies that just don't get it.

284748,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,630197350X,Byron Kolln,"[4, 4]","For my money this is still the definitive screen version of the Oscar Wilde story.  Albert Lewin's 1945 MGM production of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is one of the most fascinating films I've ever seen.Dorian Gray (Hurd Hatfield) is the very picture of the perfect Victorian gentleman.  But when his friend, Lord Henry Wotton (George Sanders), points out all of the pleasures  that a young man ought to be experiencing at Dorian's age, Dorian strikes an unconcious deal with forces unknown.  His celebrated portrait, painted by Basil Hallward (Lowell Gilmore) slowly reveals the rot and depravity of Dorian's soul, but the man himself remains gloriously young.  A romance with innocent music-hall singer Sibyl Vane (Angela Lansbury) ends in tragedy; and people in Dorian's life mysteriously vanish.  An upstairs room, housing all of Dorian's childhood possessions, also hides away the only thing that reveals the truth...the picture of Dorian Gray.Sumptuously filmed in a ""deep-focus"" photography style, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a fine example of the MGM gloss at it's finest, despite the shortages that had to be accommodated during the war years.  Albert Lewin, unlike so many of his peers, had a deep passion for the written word, and his screen treatment of DORIAN GRAY displays a strong literary link to the original novel (with a few slight character alterations).  The titular portrait (created by Ivan Le Lorraine Albright and filmed, during it's various phases of decay, in bold Technicolor) now hangs at the Art Institute of Chicago.Hurd Hatfield delivers handsomely in the title role, although it was a performance he was, in reality, deeply frustrated by.  Never believing he was ""beautiful"" enough for the part to begin with, Hatfield also felt restricted by director Albert Lewin, who didn't want Hatfield to move his face during his performance.  Lewin wanted Dorian to be icy and glacial, and Hatfield felt that his portrayal, which he hoped to base on the original character as written by Wilde, was now severely restricted.  In the years to follow, Hatfield would have an almost obsessive love/hate relationship with the character that sealed his brief screen fame.Angela Lansbury's portrayal of the vaudevillian ingenue who falls for Dorian is one of the most haunting and memorable from her early career.  Can you imagine that upon signing up with MGM in 1944, she'd film ""National Velvet"", ""Gaslight"" and THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY all in quick succession?  Her fame was sealed from the beginning!  George Sanders is terrificly ambiguous as the man who becomes the catalyst for Dorian's descent into depravity.  Donna Reed and Peter Lawford are delightfully bland as the young lovers caught up in the plot.Warner's DVD includes a great audio commentary from Angela Lansbury and film historian Steve Haberman; plus the vintage featurettes ""Stairway to Light"", ""Quiet Please"", and the trailer.",5,"""You think it's only God who sees the soul""",1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,2916,"['money', 'still', 'definitive', 'screen', 'version', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'story', 'Albert', 'Lewin', '1945', 'MGM', 'production', 'THE', 'PICTURE', 'OF', 'DORIAN', 'GRAY', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Dorian', 'Gray', 'Hurd', 'Hatfield', 'very', 'picture', 'perfect', 'Victorian', 'gentleman', 'when', 'friend', 'Lord', 'Henry', 'Wotton', 'George', 'Sanders', 'out', 'pleasures', 'young', 'man', 'ought', 'be', 'experiencing', 'Dorian', 'age', 'Dorian', 'unconcious', 'deal', 'forces', 'unknown', 'celebrated', 'portrait', 'painted', 'Basil', 'Hallward', 'Lowell', 'Gilmore', 'slowly', 'rot', 'depravity', 'Dorian', 'soul', 'man', 'gloriously', 'young', 'romance', 'innocent', 'music-hall', 'singer', 'Sibyl', 'Vane', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'tragedy', 'people', 'Dorian', 'life', 'mysteriously', 'vanish', 'upstairs', 'room', 'housing', 'Dorian', 'childhood', 'possessions', 'also', 'away', 'only', 'thing', 'truth', 'picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray.Sumptuously', 'filmed', 'deep-focus', 'photography', 'style', 'PICTURE', 'OF', 'DORIAN', 'GRAY', 'fine', 'example', 'MGM', 'gloss', 'finest', 'shortages', 'had', 'be', 'accommodated', 'war', 'years', 'Albert', 'Lewin', 'so', 'many', 'peers', 'had', 'deep', 'passion', 'written', 'word', 'screen', 'treatment', 'DORIAN', 'GRAY', 'strong', 'literary', 'link', 'original', 'novel', 'few', 'slight', 'character', 'alterations', 'titular', 'portrait', 'created', 'Ivan', 'Le', 'Lorraine', 'Albright', 'filmed', 'various', 'phases', 'decay', 'bold', 'Technicolor', 'now', 'Art', 'Institute', 'Chicago.Hurd', 'Hatfield', 'delivers', 'handsomely', 'title', 'role', 'was', 'performance', 'was', 'reality', 'deeply', 'frustrated', 'Never', 'believing', 'was', 'beautiful', 'enough', 'part', 'begin', 'Hatfield', 'also', 'felt', 'restricted', 'director', 'Albert', 'Lewin', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'Hatfield', 'move', 'face', 'performance', 'Lewin', 'wanted', 'Dorian', 'be', 'icy', 'glacial', 'Hatfield', 'felt', 'portrayal', 'hoped', 'base', 'original', 'character', 'written', 'Wilde', 'was', 'now', 'severely', 'restricted', 'years', 'follow', 'Hatfield', 'would', 'have', 'almost', 'obsessive', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'character', 'sealed', 'brief', 'screen', 'fame.Angela', 'Lansbury', 'portrayal', 'vaudevillian', 'ingenue', 'who', 'Dorian', 'one', 'most', 'haunting', 'memorable', 'early', 'career', 'Can', 'imagine', 'upon', 'signing', 'up', 'MGM', '1944', ""'d"", 'film', 'National', 'Velvet', 'Gaslight', 'THE', 'PICTURE', 'OF', 'DORIAN', 'GRAY', 'quick', 'succession', 'fame', 'was', 'sealed', 'beginning', 'George', 'Sanders', 'terrificly', 'ambiguous', 'man', 'who', 'catalyst', 'Dorian', 'descent', 'depravity', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'are', 'delightfully', 'bland', 'young', 'lovers', 'caught', 'up', 'plot.Warner', 'DVD', 'great', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'film', 'historian', 'Steve', 'Haberman', 'vintage', 'Stairway', 'Light', 'Quiet', 'Please', 'trailer']",N/A

284756,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,630197350X,C. Middleton,"[79, 84]","This 1945 film adaptation of Oscar Wilde's classic novella is more that likely the best adaptation one will ever see. This may seem to be a big statement, but Albert Lewin's direction along with Harry Stradling Sr.'s Oscar winning Cinematography for 1946, appears almost flawless when comparing the classic novel with the film.George Sanders as Lord Henry Wotton should have won the Oscar that year for best supporting actor because his performance is faultless, brimming with style and wit. To my mind, he is Oscar Wilde, snobbish, intelligent and uses his tongue as a sword, cutting anyone down to size who cares to challenge him. Some of his lines from the screenplay are pure gems that Wilde is so famous for:""I like persons better than principles and persons with no principles better than anything at all.""""Forgive me for the intelligence of my argument; I'd forgotten you were a Member of Parliament.""Dorian Gray (Hurd Hatfield) is a slightly effeminent aristocrat who makes a Faustian pact to gain eternal youth. Gray's portrait, however, reveals Gray's soul, as he plunges himself into the dark and criminal world of 19th century London. Gray is selfish, uncaring, and arrogant and portrays the true 19th century hedonist; a Wildean character in the truest sense, as the then infamous novel, during the famous Wilde trials, was partly responsible for his four year imprisonment. This was the time when homosexuality was illegal, and Oscar Wilde became a scapegoat for the English's notorious hypocrisy.Angela Lansbury as Sibyl Vane won her the Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. She is beautiful in this role, touching and almost pitiful as her innocence is corrupted by the cruel Dorian Gray.What is curious about this film is that it is black and white; however, the actual portrait of Dorian is shown four times through the film in colour.This was the only novel Oscar Wilde ever wrote, as he was predominantly a playwright and poet. The book also is a comment on the ""Art for Art's Sake"" sensibility and a philosophical commentary on the Aesthetic movement. The film also touches on these points, albeit on a superficial level.This is a wonderful film and one hopes that in the near future it will be available on DVD.Absolutely excellent.",5,An Exceptional Film Adaptation of the Classic Novel,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,2255,"['1945', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'classic', 'novella', 'more', 'likely', 'best', 'adaptation', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'big', 'statement', 'Albert', 'Lewin', 'direction', 'Harry', 'Stradling', 'Sr.', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Cinematography', '1946', 'almost', 'flawless', 'when', 'comparing', 'classic', 'novel', 'film.George', 'Sanders', 'Lord', 'Henry', 'Wotton', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'year', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'performance', 'faultless', 'brimming', 'style', 'wit', 'mind', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'snobbish', 'intelligent', 'tongue', 'sword', 'cutting', 'anyone', 'down', 'size', 'who', 'challenge', 'lines', 'screenplay', 'are', 'pure', 'gems', 'Wilde', 'so', 'famous', 'like', 'persons', 'better', 'principles', 'persons', 'principles', 'better', 'anything', 'Forgive', 'intelligence', 'argument', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'were', 'Member', 'Parliament', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'Hurd', 'Hatfield', 'slightly', 'effeminent', 'aristocrat', 'who', 'Faustian', 'pact', 'gain', 'eternal', 'youth', 'Gray', 'portrait', 'however', 'reveals', 'Gray', 'soul', 'dark', 'criminal', 'world', '19th', 'century', 'London', 'Gray', 'selfish', 'uncaring', 'arrogant', 'true', '19th', 'century', 'hedonist', 'Wildean', 'character', 'truest', 'sense', 'then', 'infamous', 'novel', 'famous', 'Wilde', 'trials', 'was', 'partly', 'responsible', 'four', 'year', 'imprisonment', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'homosexuality', 'was', 'illegal', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'became', 'scapegoat', 'English', 'notorious', 'hypocrisy.Angela', 'Lansbury', 'Sibyl', 'Vane', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'beautiful', 'role', 'touching', 'almost', 'pitiful', 'innocence', 'corrupted', 'cruel', 'Dorian', 'Gray.What', 'curious', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'however', 'actual', 'portrait', 'Dorian', 'shown', 'four', 'times', 'film', 'colour.This', 'was', 'only', 'novel', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'ever', 'wrote', 'was', 'predominantly', 'playwright', 'poet', 'book', 'also', 'comment', 'Art', 'Art', 'Sake', 'sensibility', 'philosophical', 'commentary', 'Aesthetic', 'movement', 'film', 'also', 'points', 'albeit', 'superficial', 'level.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'one', 'near', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'DVD.Absolutely', 'excellent']",N/A
284757,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,630197350X,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 4]","We first meet Lord Henry Wotton in his carriage reading Les Fleurs du Mal, a dead give away to the corrupt pleasures and literary pretensions that director/writer Albert Lewin is going to ladle up for us. Lord Henry is a man who speaks in a continuing stream of tiresomely witty and cynical epigrams a man named Wilde, hired for the purpose, prepares for him each morning. Lord Henry is on his way to meet a friend, the painter Basil Hallward. And at Hallward's studio he spots the portrait of an aesthetically handsome, Chopin playing, innocent young man named Dorian Gray. And, by coincidence, Dorian is in Hallward's parlor playing the piano and waiting to pose.Says Lord Henry (George Sanders) to the impressionable young man, ""There's no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral. The aim of life is self-development, to realize one's nature perfectly. That's what we're here for. A man should live out his life fully and completely, give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream. There's only one way to get rid of a temptation and that's to yield to it. Resist it, and the soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself. There's nothing that cures the soul but the senses, just as there is nothing that cures the senses but the soul."" If we haven't gotten the idea yet, during this turgid bit of life philosophy, Lord Henry is at the same time using paint alcohol to carefully kill the butterfly he had captured in his hat.And before you know it, Dorian Gray (Hurd Hatfield) decides he never wants to age and wants to explore all those temptations he's heard about. It's not long before the portrait changes a bit, so he puts it in his attic. While Gray experiences the delights of debauchery, and the special delights of debauching others, Angela Lansbury shows up, excellently, as the tragic Sibyl Vane. Donna Reed also shows up as a young woman being groomed by Hollywood for star roles. Lansbury, 20 years old, doesn't need the Hollywood grooming. She's strikingly good. And Dorian Gray never ages. But, oh, does that hidden portrait show a man we'd never want to meet in a dark side street, or, for that matter, in broad daylight...leering, cankerous, face aflame with corrupt poisons, pustules leaking vile fluid, aching to caress and tear tender, uncorrupted flesh. Wow! But fate and justice will have its way. Dorian Gray finds a slender chance at redemption, and even Lord Henry, when he sees the result of his philosophy of life, looks taken aback. Just to remind us how serious this story is, we also have Cedric Hardwicke speaking a narrative. It's just as unconsciously amusing as Herbert Marshall's narrative inThe Razor's Edge.The Picture of Dorian Gray is lush, earnest melodrama, tinged with the kind of oh-my-goodness-horror that polite society might say holds a moral lesson. The movie isn't as overpoweringly pretentious as Lewin'sPandora and the Flying Dutchman. That one could have derailed James Mason's and Ava Gardner's careers if Mason hadn't been such a good actor and Gardner such a force of female nature.The movie is driven by Lord Henry's philosophy and the depiction of what that philosophy will lead to. George Sanders was never better than when he could drip cynicism like a beaker filled to the brim with acid. He delivers here with great style, but all those Wildean epigrams and cynical wit he has to speak make his character tedious and predictable. Too much cleverness. Hurd Hatfield is the odd card. He had an almost frozen face. Little emotion shows. There is something about his mouth and lower face that reminds me of a well-preserved Egyptian mummy. For my money, this look makes Dorian Gray a very off character, and it adds immensely to the movie's odd watchability.If Hollywood's idea of what it takes to show literary culture in a movie (think of Hardwicke's narration), endless witticisms from Oscar Wilde and three-strip Technicolor in a black-and-white movie for showing a corrupt portrait appeals to you, you may enjoy this glossy potboiler. The movie's Hollywood cultural pretentiousness makes it worth watching at least once. I enjoyed its oddness and George Sanders' skill with a nasty, witty line. If you really have a taste for what some innocents might say are corrupt paintings, but great ones nonetheless, watchLove Is the Devil. It's sort of the story of the great British painter Francis Bacon, played by Derek Jacobi. Then look up some of Bacon's paintings. Be warned; Bacon didn't do sunset landscapes of deer looking over forest waterfalls.The DVD transfer of The Picture of Dorian Gray looks very good.",4,Lord Henry justifies the corruption while Albert Lewin provides the literary pretensions.

So I didn't - I got my kitties and went to bed instead.In keeping with the scatteredness of the film, I make no attempt to prevent my thoughts here from having any semblance of order. My main gripes... concern the cast, the plot, and the dialogue. George Sanders talked too fast here. I couldn't make out much of what he said at all. The dude who played Dorian Gray was a creepy weirdo. He looked like a snake. (Have you ever read Daphne du Maurier's excellent short story about the blue glasses, and how the girl who wore them saw every person as an animal, thus revealing their true characters? Dorian simply has to be a snake.) From the very beginning he was just downright weird. He was also about as wooden an actor as anyone could wish. Half the time his only requirement was to stand still and stare at something as he thought aloud, or waited for a break in Sanders' narration. And they talk about Tippi Hedren being wooden... Anyway, this was very slow moving and bewildering, seemingly without a plot, and little connection between one scene and the next. And how many times did Angela Lansbury have to sing that bird song? Once was plenty.As you can see, I wasn't impressed - I'd give this no stars if I could, and I don't think I'll ever bother to sit it out to the end again.

Beauty and vanity drive this man.  His horrors remain forever hidden as they are bound in a portrait.  The film adaptation is marvelously done.  The quiet stated Victorian culture dominates, and almost makes the film feel slow, but the genius is hiding evil in the mundane.  A man who never ages does not scare his contemporaries, but it scares me.  Nothing graphic or gory, this film haunts with the idea that evil is always lurking, but you may never see it.When the director does exhibit an ""illustration"" of evil, the audience is treated the gruesome portrait painted by Ivan Albright (available to view in the gallery at the Art Institute of Chicago).  The painting, and its Technicolor presentation on film, is brilliant and striking.  The effect of this colorized image with dramatic music is shocking and haunting.Beautifully under-acted with true Victorian zeal, George Sanders, Angela Lansbury, and Peter Lawford do a superb job.  Donna Reed did not enjoy making this film, and it shows.  Hurd Hatfield is remarkable as the youthful, soulless cad Dorian Gray.

The whole obsession with youth and having his portrait turn evil is really interesting. However this movie needs to seriously be updated. It's a good film but I have too many gripes about it. It's too slow moving, the characters talk too fast and I can't understand a word (especially Lord Henry), and half the time it's just really hard to follow! I agree with half of the reviews here who said Hurd Hatfield was too wooden! My God anyone can do better acting than that. I don't know if he was channeling the character of Dorian but there was nothing charming about this guy. He was supposed to be very good looking and mesmorizing, but Hurd was a robot! He didn't seem life like at all. Way too cold, way too still, and way too wooden. He just stared blankly and when he talked he barely made any expressions or moved his mouth. I'm supposed to feel sorry for him? Hardly! The great thing about this movie is the portrait itself. It's very eery and I love how it's in color. That's pretty neat. The rest is just UGH. I hear they are doing a remake with Ryan Phillipe. Now THAT should be interesting! Although I think Ryan may be a little too old for the part of Dorian, he certainly is handsome!

Its stark, raw ugliness is jarring and out of sync with the high production values of this studio classic, and the Technicolor portrait against the black-and-white cinematography is a technique that comes off now as simply corny.

the mad scientist (Frankenstein);the vampire( Dracula) and the shape shifter (The Werewolf of Paris/Jekyll and Hyde )it is not generally accorded the sort of elevated status of a Dickens or an  Austen but rather is seen as a minor work that has some resonanace on the mythic level as establishing a form of literary shorthand .We all know what Jekyll and Hyde personality means even if we have never read the book.This movie of the Wilde novel is likewise a semi-classic ;respected but rarely spoken of in the same breath as the Universal or Hammer classics of the genre .It is elaborate and well mounted ,subtle and disturbing rather than truly frightening and a movie that establishes a miasma of corruption rather than going for the gross out .Hurd Hatfield plays Dorian ,a handsome youth in Victorian England who falls under the influence of the hedonistic Lord Henry Wooton (George Sanders).He has his portrait painted and makes a Faustian bargain -his picture will age hideously ,to reflect his increasing moral corruption ,while he will forever retain the form of youth and handomeness.The movie is reminiscent of the Val Lewton RKO movies of the era in that nothing overtly horrific takes place  on screen until the portrait is revealed in the closing scene when the sombre and elegant black and white gives way to garish and lurid colour .This is the only visual shock in the movie and the picture is truly repellant ,a reflection of the corrupt soul Dorian has become.The change in the music that takes palce at the same time effectively reinforces this -it becomes discordant and brash .The picture is by Ivan Allbright and it is very potent indeed .Hatfield as the psychic vampire and philanderer is excellent ,playing with a deliberate flatness and lack of emotion that is effective .Sanders is ideal casting , dispensing Wildean epigrams with elegant insouciance and Angela Lansbury is superb in an Oscar nominated turn as Sybil Vane a cheap actress Dorian briefly takes up with .Oscars went to Cedric Gibbons and Harry Peters for best monochrome photography and quite rightly soThe script by Albert Lewin who also directs well relies too heavily on voice

Dorian has an ideal and decides to have his portrait painted by a close friend. Soon after, under the influence of amoral Lord Henry Wotton (George Sanders), he jilts his fianc&eacute;e (a young and very beautiful Angela Lansbury), leading to her suicide. This is the start of a life of increasing debauchery!  Gray soon realizes that the outward signs of his sinister new persona are apparent only in the portrait. Eventually the picture, secreted in his childhood playroom, becomes almost hideous to behold. But Gray still has one pure love - Gladys (Donna Reed), the niece of the original painter.  Will Gladys' love be strong enough to save Dorian from the curses and immorality that has plagued his life?  Is there any purity left in Dorian's heart to give him any chance of redemption or hope of salvation?  And how much has the portrait of Dorian Gray actually changed after all of these years of absorbing Dorian's secrets, sins, and lies?  It is all exposed in the grand finale as the door to the playroom is finally opened and the portrait of the true Dorian Gray unmasks his youth and beauty!Oscar Wilde's immortal classic ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" is still long overdue for a much-needed DVD release.  This viewing of the classic was made possible by a good friend who loaned me his VHS copy, of which I'm most grateful!  The entire cast is flawless in this 1945 adaptation of Wilde's novella!  George Sanders is phenomenal as Lord Harry Wotton and this is his second best performance, the first being his mastering the screen as acid tongued theatre critic Addison Dewitt in the Bette Davis vs. Anne Baxter classic ""All About Eve"" (1950).  This is in the only film that I recall seeing Hurd Hatfield starring in. With his strong aristocratic good looks and effeminent acting skills, I can't imagine why he wasn't used in more films of the time.  Angela Lansbury is so lovely and young here and brings an innocent beauty to the screen as Dorian's fianc&eacute;e, Sybil Vane.  I have long been a fan of this classic film and highly recommend it to all fans of classic cinema!

The movie was a pretty faithful adaptation, I see, although Dorian didn't seem to have a very clear reason for breaking his engagement with Sybil Vane in the movie. And since that was the beginning of the end, it seemed a little off.That Lord Henry is something. He comes across to me as the one who is evil, not Dorian. He is the worst influence ever! And yet, he doesn't even realize it. He thinks he is the most intelligent being who has ever walked the face of the Earth. He knows everything and is superior to everyone. I have never seen anyone with a bigger ego. It would be interesting to get a look into HIS soul and see the results of all the people he has damaged. You almost don't notice it, though. He talks so fast and with such authority that he sounds like an intellectual. He's hard to actually listen to, but when you manage to pay attention, you realize how pompous he is. It's just a shame that all the bad things happened to Dorian and those around Dorian while Lord Henry got away pretty much scot-free. Not that Dorian was innocent, by any means. But he was definitely corrupted.I loved the shock of seeing the final portrait... in full color. I think it's a shame that we didn't get to see any views of the portrait along the way... subtle changes caused by various minor sins. I think they could have done that toward the beginning and still had the big surprise at the end. All we got at first was the small change in his facial expression.What if in real life people's sins showed up on the outside as well as aging? How convenient would that be?

When he sees it he wishes with his whole heart that he could remain just as he is now.. beautiful, remote, elegant and untouched by time or the world and if only his portrait could do the aging for him. Well, Dorian makes the wish in the presence of an Egyptian statue of the goddess Basht and somehow his wish is granted.This might not be such a bad thing but Dorian falls under the spell of Sir Henry, a shameless old rouge played with gusto by George Sanders. Sir Henry tells the young man to do as he pleases. Although Dorian's other good friend makes a several weak appeals for him to ingore Sir Henry the young man listens and learns too well.Dorian gets a brief reprieve in the form of sweet innocent Sybil, played by Angela Lansbury but he blows it and causes her death. The nastiness of his behavior shows up on the portrait. Frightened Dorian hides it and goes on his merry way. The movie was made in 1945 so it was impossible to show all of his sins in detail but the writers were clever and adults understand euphemisms so the audience understands that Dorian is into some really bad stuff. There are men who get up and leave when he comes into a room. In one scene a wealthy young woman at a party catches sight of Dorian and her smile vanishes. She turns pale and looks down at her feet. In another scene the audience hears that a young male acquaintanc of Dorian's has committed suicide and another male friend has shocked everyone by abruptly leaving the country.

284789,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,630197350X,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[2, 2]","Oscar Wilde only ever wrote one novel, which would actually be used against him at trial.Dorian Gray is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and one of the few that deserves to be called a classic.Classic because this movie, has so many layers and textures which make the story linger in your mind long after the final credits roll. If you're like me, the more you reflect on it later  the more you have great insights into not only the movie but human nature itself.Dorian Gray would give anything even his soul to remain eternally youthful, and under the corrupt yet engagingly witty influence of Lord Henry, a somewhat Mephistophelian character.  When he makes this utterance in the presence of a mystical Egptian cat, his soul and senses separate, his face retains its youthfulness, and the picture starts to reflect his true horrible nature from his first horrible act, and quickly gets hidden away in shame in a secret room.Under Lord Henry's guidance, Dorian with his frozen facial expression, behaves badly with dire consequences.  As years pass things get worse and worse, as the picture hidden away continues to reflect his shadow side back to him.  You may wonder how bad do things have to get before he changes his ways, and will he seek redemption, or will he be consumed by his own darkness.There are interesting parallels between this and Wilde's real life. Wilde was an aesthetic, consumed by the idea of beauty in the world, although clearly Wilde is not superficial. He said that Dorian Gray represented his desire for youth, Lord Henry was the somewhat public persona of Wilde, witty and engaging, how other people perceived him.  The artist Aylward was the true character of Wilde.  Wilde ultimately turns away, at least in this story from this philosophy.Like the artist Aylward, the artist Wilde would suffer from his own creation, and in real life Wilde was called out of his secret room by the Marquess of Queensbery, inventor of the Queensbery rules of boxing, who accused him of being a homosexual, for his pursuit of his son Lord Alfred Douglas.Wilde sued for libel and lost. He was then arrested and charged with sodomy and gross indecency, and got jailed for two years. He was never the same after that, fled to France and died penniless in exile.  He lived from 1854 to 1900.His hedonistic philosophy and behavior, and eschewing of morality in a moral society, at least on the surface would prove his downfall, and assure his ongoing fame, although the brilliance of his work stands by itself without the scandal.But I digress. The movie won an Academy Award for cinematography, and the reason is plain to see.  The cameraman uses deep focus so you see tremendous detail on small objects in the background. As the movie is black and white, we see the shades of light and dark flashing back and forth illuminating Dorian Gray's face.  Angela Lansbury never looked better in any movie than she appears here, and admits this herself in the commentary. Donna Reed from It's a wonderful Life also appears. Undoubtedly though, the acting credit goes to George Sanders portrayal of Lord Henry. Absolute perfection.Apparently Hatfield, who plays Dorian was forced by the director to maintain the same facial expression just like a portrait. Directors would not hire him later, because he was so identified with this movie, and they thought he lacked facial expression.I highly recommend this movie.  I think you will love it.

The sets and costumes and deep-focus photography combine to make even more absorbing the story Oscar Wilde tells of the man whose portrait decays as he himself remains forever youthful.Hurd Hatfield never had a better role and he makes the most of it. George Sanders, Angela Lansbury, Donna Reed, Peter Lawford, Lionel Gilmore, George Sanders, Morton Lowry and many others contribute to the overall excellence of the acting. The period atmosphere of late-Victorian London adds much to the slowly growing horror of the tale.If you want action and special effects, see a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film--forget this. But as a compelling and psychological study of a man influenced by evil (personified by George Sanders as Lord Henry), this version is better than any of the others made since. It's chilling, the way Wilde intended, and no one could deliver his cynical yet witty observations about human nature better than George Sanders. Hurd Hatfield makes an excellent impression as the youthful Dorian who makes the mistake of getting what he wished for. The handsome portrait of Dorian looks especially fine in the brief Technicolor inserts and the depraved portrait almost jumps off the screen.By all means, an outstanding film.

This Commentary could have benefited from greater editing and compression: much is unsaid and there are times when the comments are not focused on the scene at hand.  There is also a bonus cartoon and short.The real loss here is a lack of information about the painters who created the portraits of Dorian Gray used in the film (Ivan Albright did the grotesquely decomposed version, which is now in the Art Institute of Chicago, and the younger portrait was the work of the comparatively unheralded Portuguese painter Henrique Medina).

Dorian Gray, a young man living in Victorian London, has his portrait painted by an artist named Basil Hallward, himself fascinated by Gray's youthful innocence. Egged on by the amoral Lord Henry, Gray manages to keep himself youthful by giving up his soul, and proceeds to indulge in a life of selfish hedonism and cruelty while through the years his face stays unnaturally young...While not a totally successful transition of Wilde's wickedly elegant novel - it's too glum and slow paced - there's much to admire in this 1945 version of the bizarre theme. Hatfield was an inspired choice for the title role, combining his handsome, ethereal face with his cool, aloof manner which perfectly suited Wilde's corrupted aristocrat.

284807,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,630197350X,Simon Davis,"[12, 13]","The chief criticism of MGM's film version of Oscar Wilde's classic story ""The Picture Of Dorian Gray"" always appears to be the choice of a rather, (at first glance) wooden Hurd Hatfield playing the mysterious Dorian Gray. In actual fact his waxwork like presence in the story I feel heightens the sense of drama and mystery surrounding this strange tale of a young man who sells his soul in order to remain forever young while his recently painted  portrait ages as a direct result of his ongoing moral decline.Based on the famous novel by Oscar Wilde MGM pulled out all the stops in bringing this story to the screen. A Pandro Berman Production, the film was both scripted and directed by Albert Lewin who was responsible for another surreal classic in ""Pandora And The Flying Dutchman"". Casting in this production is impeccable. Hurd Hatfield who forever after would be associated in people's minds with this role is I believe perfect as Dorian Gray the young aristocrat in Victorian London who outwardly is the very image of innocence but who underneath is the personification of depravity and evil. His angelic appearance and expressionless manner is superb in conveying the corruption and depravity that the character is guilty of (off camera of course), and it was a stroke of genius to use him rather than another more obviously villianess looking type. Here ""suggestion"" is the overwhelming quality which makes this version of ""The Picture Of Dorian Gray"" such a masterpiece. George Sanders is perfectly cast as dissolute gentleman Lord Henry Wotton a friend of Dorian's who has made a lifetimes work out of totally avoiding any work or personal commitment of any kind and who is a fountain of cynicism and wry observations about people and their failings. It is a role tailor made for Sanders much akin to his characters in ""All About Eve"" and ""Rebecca"". Angela Lansbury in only her third Hollywood production shines in the role of Sibyl Vane a sad little singer at the Two Turtles Pub who falls in love with Dorian and becomes one of the first victims of his vicious disregard for the feelings of others. Lansbury received another Academy Award nomination for this role (the first being for the classic ""Gaslight""). The main cast is rounded out by a lovely Donna Reed as Gladys Hallward Dorian's later fiance, Lowell Gilmore in a superb performance as the painter Basil Hallward, Gladys's uncle who is responsible for the portrait of Dorian and who pays the ultimate price for its creation, and Peter Lawford newly arrived in Hollywood as David Stone an admirer of Gladys.The film was a major production for that year at MGM and no expense was spared in bringing it to the screen. Cedric Gibbons MGM's legendary set designer outdid himself in the recreation of Victorian London and his elaborate interiors add greatly to the overall look of the film. Costumer Irene also has to be singled out for her wonderful period costumes for both the men and women which are so accurately a refection of this era. The real standout feature  in ""The Picture Of Dorian Grey"" however must  go to the very famous Oscar winning photography of Harry Stradling who not only enhanced the superb black and white interiors but provided the film with the intriguing breaks into technicolour whenever a closeup view of Dorian Gray's portrait was revealed. This is startingly done without warning to maximum effect and is a vital part in revealing to the audience the growing depravity and decay that Dorian's character undergoes while he doesn't visibly change one bit. Even today these colour sequences pack a real punch and really add to the overall horror of this story.They are without a doubt the main thing that people today remember the film for and they truly deserved the Academy Award that year.""The Picture Of Dorian Gray"" certainly would not appeal to all viewers. Much of what is said or done is off camera throughout the film but the building sense of menace and doom really suceeds in keeping the viewers attention. I love this story and strongly believe that Hurd Hatfield really makes the film a memorable piece directly because he actually does little in the story. A definite horror piece it is and if you like a film where you have to think and where things are often implied and where the characters are richly drawn from great literature then ""The Picture Of Dorian Gray"" is highly recommended viewing.",4,Haunting and mysterious tale with a disturbing leading man,1043625600,"01 27, 2003",2003,4411,"['chief', 'criticism', 'MGM', 'film', 'version', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'classic', 'story', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'always', 'be', 'choice', 'rather', 'first', 'glance', 'wooden', 'Hurd', 'Hatfield', 'playing', 'mysterious', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'actual', 'fact', 'waxwork', 'presence', 'story', 'feel', 'sense', 'drama', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'strange', 'tale', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'soul', 'order', 'remain', 'forever', 'young', 'recently', 'painted', 'portrait', 'ages', 'direct', 'result', 'ongoing', 'moral', 'decline.Based', 'famous', 'novel', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'MGM', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'bringing', 'story', 'screen', 'Pandro', 'Berman', 'Production', 'film', 'was', 'scripted', 'directed', 'Albert', 'Lewin', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'surreal', 'classic', 'Pandora', 'Flying', 'Dutchman', 'Casting', 'production', 'impeccable', 'Hurd', 'Hatfield', 'who', 'forever', 'would', 'be', 'associated', 'people', 'minds', 'role', 'believe', 'perfect', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'young', 'aristocrat', 'Victorian', 'London', 'who', 'outwardly', 'very', 'image', 'innocence', 'who', 'underneath', 'personification', 'depravity', 'evil', 'angelic', 'appearance', 'expressionless', 'manner', 'superb', 'conveying', 'corruption', 'depravity', 'character', 'guilty', 'camera', 'course', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'use', 'rather', 'more', 'obviously', 'villianess', 'looking', 'type', 'Here', 'suggestion', 'overwhelming', 'quality', 'version', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'such', 'masterpiece', 'George', 'Sanders', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'dissolute', 'gentleman', 'Lord', 'Henry', 'Wotton', 'friend', 'Dorian', 'who', 'made', 'lifetimes', 'work', 'totally', 'avoiding', 'work', 'personal', 'commitment', 'kind', 'who', 'fountain', 'cynicism', 'wry', 'observations', 'people', 'failings', 'role', 'tailor', 'made', 'Sanders', 'much', 'akin', 'characters', 'Eve', 'Rebecca', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'only', 'third', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'shines', 'role', 'Sibyl', 'Vane', 'sad', 'little', 'singer', 'Two', 'Turtles', 'Pub', 'who', 'love', 'Dorian', 'one', 'first', 'victims', 'vicious', 'disregard', 'feelings', 'others', 'Lansbury', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'role', 'first', 'being', 'classic', 'Gaslight', 'main', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'lovely', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Gladys', 'Hallward', 'Dorian', 'later', 'fiance', 'Lowell', 'Gilmore', 'superb', 'performance', 'painter', 'Basil', 'Hallward', 'Gladys', 'uncle', 'who', 'responsible', 'portrait', 'Dorian', 'who', 'ultimate', 'price', 'creation', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'newly', 'arrived', 'Hollywood', 'David', 'Stone', 'admirer', 'Gladys.The', 'film', 'was', 'major', 'production', 'year', 'MGM', 'expense', 'was', 'spared', 'bringing', 'screen', 'Cedric', 'Gibbons', 'MGM', 'legendary', 'set', 'designer', 'outdid', 'recreation', 'Victorian', 'London', 'elaborate', 'interiors', 'add', 'greatly', 'overall', 'look', 'film', 'Costumer', 'Irene', 'also', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'wonderful', 'period', 'costumes', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'so', 'accurately', 'refection', 'era', 'real', 'standout', 'feature', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Grey', 'however', 'must', 'go', 'very', 'famous', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'photography', 'Harry', 'Stradling', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'enhanced', 'superb', 'black', 'white', 'interiors', 'provided', 'film', 'intriguing', 'breaks', 'technicolour', 'whenever', 'closeup', 'view', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'portrait', 'was', 'revealed', 'startingly', 'done', 'warning', 'maximum', 'effect', 'vital', 'part', 'revealing', 'audience', 'growing', 'depravity', 'decay', 'Dorian', 'character', 'undergoes', ""n't"", 'visibly', 'change', 'one', 'bit', 'Even', 'today', 'colour', 'sequences', 'pack', 'real', 'punch', 'really', 'add', 'overall', 'horror', 'story.They', 'are', 'doubt', 'main', 'thing', 'people', 'today', 'remember', 'film', 'truly', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'year', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'Much', 'what', 'said', 'done', 'camera', 'film', 'building', 'sense', 'menace', 'doom', 'really', 'keeping', 'viewers', 'attention', 'love', 'story', 'strongly', 'believe', 'Hurd', 'Hatfield', 'really', 'film', 'memorable', 'piece', 'directly', 'actually', 'little', 'story', 'definite', 'horror', 'piece', 'like', 'film', 'where', 'have', 'think', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'often', 'implied', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'richly', 'drawn', 'great', 'literature', 'then', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'highly', 'recommended', 'viewing']",N/A
