22777,A1K6DOPS37VWRJ,0767850661,"Carolyn E. Ribas ""karrie122""","[5, 5]","Jill the Ripper is not like any other Dolph Lundgren movie; its one of Dolph's best performances. The movie is set in the 1970's and Dolph plays an ex-cop and boxer (Matt Sorenson) whose brother is killed during some really bizarre sex act. Matt delves into the world of S&amp;M trying to find his brother's killer. This movie was filmed very well. You should see it for the setting and lighting if not for the actual story. Also, the DVD version contains a very interesting director's commentary from Anthony Hickox (who directed the film). All of the actors turned in pretty good performances. One problem with the movie is that you know who the killer is pretty much from the beginning. There are also some problems with the editing which sometimes makes you wonder what is motivating the characters' behavior, and several of the characters go by 2 or 3 different names which is confusing, but overall this is good movie. Some people might say its boring, I say its taking its time; Dolph's character is actually trying to develop. If you want an action Dolph flick where he kills everyone and flexes his muscles, DON'T watch this movie, watch Red Scorpion or Universal Soldier instead. If you want a semi-suspenseful horror flick (and to see Dolph tied up and hanging upside down almost naked during a bizarre sex act) watch this movie. My suggestion is to watch it at least twice. I actually hated it the first time I saw it. I don't know what made me watch it again, but the second time is the charm. Perhaps I was paying more attention the second time.",5,Not Your Average Dolph Flick,980467200,"01 26, 2001",2001,1559,"['Jill', 'Ripper', 'not', 'other', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'movie', 'one', 'Dolph', 'best', 'performances', 'movie', 'set', '1970', 'Dolph', 'ex-cop', 'boxer', 'Matt', 'Sorenson', 'brother', 'killed', 'really', 'bizarre', 'sex', 'act', 'Matt', 'world', 'S', 'amp', 'M', 'trying', 'find', 'brother', 'killer', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'very', 'well', 'should', 'see', 'setting', 'lighting', 'not', 'actual', 'story', 'Also', 'DVD', 'version', 'very', 'interesting', 'director', 'commentary', 'Anthony', 'Hickox', 'who', 'directed', 'film', 'actors', 'turned', 'pretty', 'good', 'performances', 'One', 'problem', 'movie', 'know', 'who', 'killer', 'pretty', 'much', 'beginning', 'are', 'also', 'problems', 'editing', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'what', 'motivating', 'characters', 'behavior', 'several', 'characters', 'go', '2', '3', 'different', 'names', 'confusing', 'overall', 'good', 'movie', 'people', 'might', 'say', 'boring', 'say', 'taking', 'time', 'Dolph', 'character', 'actually', 'trying', 'develop', 'want', 'action', 'Dolph', 'flick', 'where', 'everyone', 'flexes', 'muscles', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'watch', 'movie', 'watch', 'Red', 'Scorpion', 'Universal', 'Soldier', 'instead', 'want', 'semi-suspenseful', 'horror', 'flick', 'see', 'Dolph', 'tied', 'up', 'hanging', 'upside', 'down', 'almost', 'naked', 'bizarre', 'sex', 'act', 'watch', 'movie', 'suggestion', 'watch', 'least', 'twice', 'actually', 'hated', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'made', 'watch', 'again', 'second', 'time', 'charm', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'paying', 'more', 'attention', 'second', 'time']",N/A

22781,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,0767850661,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","As of this writing, it is nearly the one-year anniversary of the death of the acclaimed Scottish crime writer Frederic Lindsay. Lindsay's many detective novels remain excellent film material, though only two would see that kind of treatment in his lifetime and only one of these is widely available for purchasing. Reportedly, Lindsay was no fan of Annex Entertainment's TV treatment ofJill Rips, but the film does constitute a unique and interesting entry in the career of star Dolph Lundgren. Though narratively flawed and a bit uncomfortable for the general viewer, it's virtually the only vehicle of Lundgren's that's not written as an action feature and has enough strange/cool parts to garner an acceptable rating.The story: ex-policeman Matt Sorenson (Lundgren,Universal Soldierseries) attempts to uncover the identity of the mysterious sadomasochistic prostitute who murdered his brother.When I think of Dolph Lundgren, I think of guns and explosions, car chases and one-liners, and lots of karate fights. Dolph's had movies that were low on action in the past, but these were still technically action films whereas ""Jill the Ripper"" is clearly thriller material. The filmmakers couldn't help but include a handful of punch-ups and one scene wherein Dolph haphazardly drives a car across a dock, but by and large the focus is on the storyline's intrigue and suspense. This puts a lot of pressure on the dramatic talents of the actors - most everyone does well, with the exception of the dreadful Victor Pedtchenko (The Boondock Saints) as a violent pimp - but even more on the writers. Scribes Gareth Wardell and Kevin Bernhardt (Peaceful Warrior) do a decent job of examining S&M; culture from both the outsider and insider perspectives and craft some unique characters and dialogue, but for the most part, this isn't the most intriguing whodunit. Personally, I was able to guess the killer's identity within fifteen minutes, and several of the scenes had a throaway feel to them. Additionally, the film's pretty unfaithful to its source material, and none of the characters are even named Jill.With that said, the film offers some pretty exotic imagery. The sexual themes grant the opportunity for plenty of interesting costumes, the neatest of which is the crimson full body suit and mask favored by the killer. Also - and I can't believe I'm writing this - this is the only movie in which you're going to see ol` Dolph getting fully dominatrixed. He goes all-out on this, so that his most memorable scene involves bondage, suspension, boot-licking, hot wax, blindfolds, whipping, and gagging. This is clearly unfamiliar turf for the action hero, and for better or worse, this is easily the most morally ambiguous, shades-of-gray movie that Lundgren has ever done. All of that sexy stuff aside, this is some very sleazy stuff, wherein the main hero is not only directly involved in the wrongful killing of two prostitutes but also covers up his crimes and gets away with it. Lundgren displays a new precedent of violence towards women and has sex with his recently deceased brother's widow (Danielle Brett,Rated X) without qualm. The writers were obviously aiming for an amoral approach, but the instances of cruelty are still pretty jarring. Maybe someone who hasn't watched many other Dolph Lundgren films will be able to roll with it better, but as is, the tone feels kind of unbalanced.Production values are solid, and the visual style is appropriately grittier than most TV films of the time tended to be. While none of these highlights were enough to endear the movie to the departed Lindsay, they should be enough to make it worth a look to serious Lundgren fans who like the guy beyond his ability to beat people up and cause explosions. It's definitely not everyman's film, but ought to definitely have an audience of its own out there.",3,"""I was just wondering where I could pick up a wig like that""",1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,3856,"['writing', 'nearly', 'one-year', 'anniversary', 'death', 'acclaimed', 'Scottish', 'crime', 'writer', 'Frederic', 'Lindsay', 'Lindsay', 'many', 'detective', 'novels', 'remain', 'excellent', 'film', 'material', 'only', 'two', 'would', 'see', 'kind', 'treatment', 'lifetime', 'only', 'one', 'widely', 'available', 'purchasing', 'Reportedly', 'Lindsay', 'was', 'fan', 'Annex', 'Entertainment', 'TV', 'treatment', 'Rips', 'film', 'constitute', 'unique', 'interesting', 'entry', 'career', 'star', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Though', 'narratively', 'flawed', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'general', 'viewer', 'virtually', 'only', 'vehicle', 'Lundgren', 'not', 'written', 'action', 'feature', 'enough', 'strange/cool', 'parts', 'garner', 'acceptable', 'rating.The', 'story', 'ex-policeman', 'Matt', 'Sorenson', 'Lundgren', 'Universal', 'Soldierseries', 'uncover', 'identity', 'mysterious', 'sadomasochistic', 'prostitute', 'who', 'murdered', 'brother.When', 'think', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'think', 'guns', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'one-liners', 'lots', 'karate', 'fights', 'Dolph', 'had', 'movies', 'were', 'low', 'action', 'past', 'were', 'still', 'technically', 'action', 'films', 'Jill', 'Ripper', 'clearly', 'thriller', 'material', 'filmmakers', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'include', 'handful', 'punch-ups', 'one', 'scene', 'wherein', 'Dolph', 'haphazardly', 'car', 'dock', 'large', 'focus', 'storyline', 'intrigue', 'suspense', 'lot', 'pressure', 'dramatic', 'talents', 'actors', 'most', 'everyone', 'well', 'exception', 'dreadful', 'Victor', 'Pedtchenko', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'violent', 'pimp', 'even', 'more', 'writers', 'Scribes', 'Gareth', 'Wardell', 'Kevin', 'Bernhardt', 'Peaceful', 'Warrior', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'examining', 'S', 'M', 'culture', 'outsider', 'insider', 'perspectives', 'craft', 'unique', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'most', 'intriguing', 'whodunit', 'Personally', 'was', 'able', 'guess', 'killer', 'identity', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'several', 'scenes', 'had', 'throaway', 'feel', 'Additionally', 'film', 'pretty', 'unfaithful', 'source', 'material', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'even', 'named', 'Jill.With', 'said', 'film', 'pretty', 'exotic', 'imagery', 'sexual', 'themes', 'grant', 'opportunity', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'costumes', 'neatest', 'crimson', 'full', 'body', 'suit', 'mask', 'favored', 'killer', 'Also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'writing', 'only', 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'ol', 'Dolph', 'getting', 'fully', 'dominatrixed', 'all-out', 'most', 'memorable', 'scene', 'bondage', 'suspension', 'boot-licking', 'hot', 'wax', 'blindfolds', 'whipping', 'gagging', 'clearly', 'unfamiliar', 'turf', 'action', 'hero', 'better', 'worse', 'easily', 'most', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'shades-of-gray', 'movie', 'Lundgren', 'ever', 'done', 'sexy', 'stuff', 'aside', 'very', 'sleazy', 'stuff', 'wherein', 'main', 'hero', 'not', 'only', 'directly', 'involved', 'wrongful', 'killing', 'two', 'prostitutes', 'also', 'up', 'crimes', 'away', 'Lundgren', 'new', 'precedent', 'violence', 'towards', 'women', 'sex', 'recently', 'deceased', 'brother', 'widow', 'Danielle', 'Brett', 'Rated', 'X', 'qualm', 'writers', 'were', 'obviously', 'aiming', 'amoral', 'approach', 'instances', 'cruelty', 'are', 'still', 'pretty', 'jarring', 'Maybe', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'watched', 'many', 'other', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'roll', 'better', 'tone', 'kind', 'unbalanced.Production', 'values', 'are', 'solid', 'visual', 'style', 'appropriately', 'grittier', 'most', 'TV', 'films', 'time', 'tended', 'be', 'none', 'highlights', 'were', 'enough', 'endear', 'movie', 'departed', 'Lindsay', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'make', 'look', 'serious', 'Lundgren', 'fans', 'who', 'guy', 'ability', 'beat', 'people', 'up', 'cause', 'explosions', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyman', 'film', 'ought', 'definitely', 'have', 'audience', 'own', 'there']",N/A
