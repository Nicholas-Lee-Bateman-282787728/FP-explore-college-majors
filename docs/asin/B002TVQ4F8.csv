It is easy to follow and understand what is going on for young children. I am glad that I found this movie because it is hard finding good movies for younger kids. Especially ones that will hold their attention. This movie is about a little angel that is asked to deliver the jeweled crown to baby Jesus in the manager. It talks about the star that was followed by everyone to the manager. If you are looking for a nice movie for young kids, I cannot recommend this movie enough. I do have to say that it is a little on the short side as far as running time, just a little under a half hour. But I think that is just about right for a young kids attention span.",5,Wonderful Movie about Christmas for children to watch,1351728000,"11 1, 2012",2012,761,"['bought', 'movie', 'watch', 'young', 'nephew', 'Christmas', 'time', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'easy', 'follow', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'young', 'children', 'am', 'glad', 'found', 'movie', 'hard', 'finding', 'good', 'movies', 'younger', 'kids', 'Especially', 'ones', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'movie', 'little', 'angel', 'asked', 'deliver', 'jeweled', 'crown', 'baby', 'Jesus', 'manager', 'star', 'was', 'followed', 'everyone', 'manager', 'are', 'looking', 'nice', 'movie', 'young', 'kids', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'enough', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'little', 'short', 'side', 'as', 'far', 'running', 'time', 'just', 'little', 'half', 'hour', 'think', 'just', 'about', 'right', 'young', 'kids', 'attention', 'span']",N/A
