Adjust your sensibilities and this is Spanish Arthouse Horror, refreshingly delightful in its moody style and lurid as it can be. Otherwise; enjoy it for the trash it is. A/V quality is like what Tarantino and Rodriguez were 'loving' in their Grindhouse pics. More fun in BD I think; actually fun in any form.",5,Naschy on BD WhOOpY!,1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,381,"['so', 'many', 'deserving', 'directors', 'Paul', 'Naschy', 'respect', 'bluray', 'Adjust', 'sensibilities', 'Spanish', 'Arthouse', 'Horror', 'refreshingly', 'delightful', 'moody', 'style', 'lurid', 'can', 'be', 'Otherwise', 'enjoy', 'trash', 'A/V', 'quality', 'what', 'Tarantino', 'Rodriguez', 'were', ""'loving"", 'Grindhouse', 'pics', 'More', 'fun', 'BD', 'think', 'actually', 'fun', 'form']",N/A

I must say that I like the DVD packaging the best, as the films seem to be presented with a bit more class.  Top notch packaging on the DVD.  The Blu-ray, however, is the way to go with regard to the feature presentation.  While I did have some issues with the menu operations, as they were simply ported over from the DVD and did not always work the same, I had absolutely no problem appreciating the image quality.  The DVDs were amazing.  A lot of love and care was taken in their production.  The Blu-ray doubles the bit-rate and doubles the picture quality.  Like putting on glasses for the first time, moving from the DVD to the Blu-ray was remarkable.  The great DVD image that you were used to, all the sudden seems fuzzy in comparison to the Blu-Ray.  Both films benefited form the Blu-ray upgrade.  While BCI did not go all-out with their Bit-rate transfer, this is definitely a must-purchase for horror fans, particularly those of Paul Naschy.  And the price?  Wow.  Two movies on TWO SEPARATE Blu-ray discs for around $20!  That can NOT be beat.  My only hope is that BCI continues in this way as I have been buying all of their Spanish horror releases to this point, I am now going to wait for the Blu-ray releases as they are worth the wait.  My suggestion to them is to work on the menu operation and maybe increase the bit-rate.  Stellar release however.  Buy it.",4,Great initial effort from BCI/Deimos,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,1472,"['films', 'Blu-Ray', 'had', 'initially', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'release', 'BCI', 'must', 'say', 'like', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'best', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'presented', 'bit', 'more', 'class', 'Top', 'notch', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'however', 'way', 'go', 'regard', 'feature', 'presentation', 'did', 'have', 'issues', 'menu', 'operations', 'were', 'simply', 'ported', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'always', 'work', 'same', 'had', 'absolutely', 'problem', 'appreciating', 'image', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'were', 'amazing', 'lot', 'love', 'care', 'was', 'taken', 'production', 'Blu-ray', 'bit-rate', 'picture', 'quality', 'putting', 'glasses', 'first', 'time', 'moving', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'was', 'remarkable', 'great', 'DVD', 'image', 'were', 'used', 'sudden', 'fuzzy', 'comparison', 'Blu-Ray', 'Both', 'films', 'benefited', 'form', 'Blu-ray', 'upgrade', 'BCI', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'all-out', 'Bit-rate', 'transfer', 'definitely', 'must-purchase', 'horror', 'fans', 'particularly', 'Paul', 'Naschy', 'price', 'Wow', 'Two', 'movies', 'TWO', 'SEPARATE', 'Blu-ray', 'discs', '20', 'can', 'NOT', 'be', 'beat', 'only', 'hope', 'BCI', 'way', 'have', 'been', 'buying', 'Spanish', 'horror', 'point', 'am', 'now', 'going', 'wait', 'Blu-ray', 'releases', 'are', 'wait', 'suggestion', 'work', 'menu', 'operation', 'maybe', 'increase', 'bit-rate', 'Stellar', 'release', 'however', 'Buy']",N/A

Getting Naschy to introduce the movies is great and at it's current price you really cannot go wrong.  Both movies are good, but Night of the Werewolf is of course the best - i love that movie.  I had been looking for some older atmospheric horror like this!  I am very happy that i got this Blu-ray and hope they continue to produce these with the little bonuses... though Naschy has passed-on it is a treat to be able to have him spook-us-out introducing his films.",5,1080i but a great package,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,539,"['can', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'too', 'bad', 'other', 'lack', '1080p', 'Getting', 'Naschy', 'introduce', 'movies', 'great', 'current', 'price', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'Night', 'Werewolf', 'course', 'best', 'i', 'love', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'older', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'i', 'got', 'Blu-ray', 'hope', 'continue', 'produce', 'little', 'bonuses', 'Naschy', 'passed-on', 'treat', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'spook-us-out', 'introducing', 'films']",N/A
1118493,A16XRPF40679KG,B000YDBP5W,Michael Dobey,"[4, 4]","These are two spanish made horror films of the seventies, they used mono sound on most movies back then so the review about bad sound shouldn't phase you.  BCI unfortunately went out of business so we won't be seeing anymore blu rays from them , they managed to put out a few low budget gems though like this one and 'sister street fighter' and wisely they gave us two movies for the price of one. Something the major studios should do on older titles.  The films have clean prints which is great , I can't stand watching dirty  prints and scratches all over the place when you can clean them up digitally these days. It's  a moot point because BCI is gone and Paul Naschy followed them to the grave last year sadly. He loved making wolfman movies and they are a varied lot with 15 of them or so made by Naschy over his career. I enjoyed them all and have tried to get them on dvd; so I was glad to see this blu ray edition. It's a standard gothic wolfman tale here unlike a few of the others in like the werewolf meets dr jeckyl or  werewolf meets the vampire women,  it's more like 'mark of the wolfman'  ok , so if  you don't like low budget horror movies you don't even need to get these, these are movies from the seventies though and they have nudity etc in them so it's not low budget for preteens either imo. I would love to see tons of low budget horror and such come out on blu ray , even a straight dvd to blu ray type transfer looks better than the standard dvd,although few movies from the past will ever look like a newer one on blu ray ,restoration can make them look great.  these had really good prints so that really helps on this release. the zombies movie is really cool imo , it features the old style zombies ,created from witchcraft and those were fading out in 72 to be replaced by flesh eaters!  However; this like most low budget horror is not going to be on the top lists of most people, however low budget horror is a love of mine so on a low budget horror movie scale I give these flicks a four star rating.  sure they are awkward occasionally but the naschy werewolf movies are alot of pure fun!  Sadly there's not alot of old horror on blu ray yet. It will always look better on blu ray even if it's not restored color wise, these prints were good ones though!  Remember these are spanish horror movies which have bit different flavor from ours perhaps but you do get english soundtrack dubs too.  People who can't enjoy old horror with a bit of camp perhaps should avoid these but for those of us who dig these , I would love to see more blu rays of old foreign horror movies. And these are better than many other foreign flicks of the day due to naschys presence.",4,clean prints on these films make them better than dvd,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",2010,2696,"['are', 'two', 'spanish', 'made', 'horror', 'films', 'seventies', 'used', 'sound', 'most', 'movies', 'back', 'then', 'review', 'bad', 'sound', 'should', ""n't"", 'phase', 'BCI', 'unfortunately', 'went', 'business', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'seeing', 'anymore', 'blu', 'rays', 'managed', 'put', 'out', 'few', 'low', 'budget', 'gems', 'one', ""'sister"", 'street', 'fighter', 'wisely', 'gave', 'two', 'movies', 'price', 'one', 'Something', 'major', 'studios', 'should', 'do', 'older', 'titles', 'films', 'have', 'clean', 'prints', 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watching', 'dirty', 'prints', 'scratches', 'place', 'when', 'can', 'clean', 'up', 'digitally', 'days', 'moot', 'point', 'BCI', 'gone', 'Paul', 'Naschy', 'followed', 'grave', 'last', 'year', 'sadly', 'loved', 'making', 'wolfman', 'movies', 'are', 'varied', 'lot', '15', 'so', 'made', 'Naschy', 'career', 'enjoyed', 'have', 'tried', 'get', 'dvd', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'blu', 'ray', 'edition', 'standard', 'gothic', 'wolfman', 'tale', 'here', 'few', 'others', 'werewolf', 'dr', 'jeckyl', 'werewolf', 'meets', 'vampire', 'women', 'more', 'like', ""'mark"", 'wolfman', 'ok', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'get', 'are', 'movies', 'seventies', 'have', 'nudity', 'etc', 'not', 'low', 'budget', 'preteens', 'imo', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'tons', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'such', 'come', 'out', 'blu', 'ray', 'even', 'straight', 'dvd', 'blu', 'ray', 'type', 'transfer', 'better', 'standard', 'dvd', 'few', 'movies', 'past', 'will', 'ever', 'look', 'newer', 'one', 'blu', 'ray', 'restoration', 'can', 'make', 'look', 'great', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'prints', 'really', 'release', 'zombies', 'movie', 'really', 'cool', 'imo', 'old', 'style', 'zombies', 'created', 'witchcraft', 'were', 'fading', 'out', '72', 'be', 'replaced', 'flesh', 'eaters', 'However', 'most', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'top', 'lists', 'most', 'people', 'however', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'love', 'mine', 'so', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'movie', 'scale', 'give', 'flicks', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'sure', 'are', 'awkward', 'occasionally', 'naschy', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'are', 'alot', 'pure', 'fun', 'Sadly', 'not', 'alot', 'old', 'horror', 'blu', 'ray', 'yet', 'will', 'always', 'look', 'better', 'blu', 'ray', 'even', 'not', 'restored', 'color', 'wise', 'prints', 'were', 'good', 'ones', 'Remember', 'are', 'spanish', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'bit', 'different', 'flavor', 'ours', 'perhaps', 'do', 'get', 'english', 'soundtrack', 'dubs', 'too', 'People', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'old', 'horror', 'bit', 'camp', 'perhaps', 'should', 'avoid', 'who', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'blu', 'rays', 'old', 'foreign', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'better', 'many', 'other', 'foreign', 'flicks', 'day', 'due', 'presence']",N/A

1118495,A2PIACBCQP379Z,B000YDBP5W,Paul Hite,"[3, 5]","I had never heard of Paul Naschy before.  I did some research and found that many consider him to be a Spanish equivalent of Lon Chaney Jr.  And I must agree with this.  The first film, ""Night of the Werewolf"" is pretty good.  An evil witch wanted a werewolf under her control.  She got the werewolf but missed that ""control"" part.  So now it's an angry werewolf verses an evil witch.  Naschy has played the werewolf character many times before and the role is perfect for him....just like Chaney.  But also just like Chaney, it seems he is not so good in other roles.  The second film, ""Vengeance of the Zombies"" is pretty bad.  This really isn't Nascy's fault.  The script is rather poor and the girls who play the zombies are simply terrible.  I give the first film 3 stars and the second film 2 stars.  I hope we see some more of his werewolf films.  By the way, both films have some scenes with some nudity and would probably get an R rating because of it.  This is not obvious looking at the cover or description. It doesn't bother me, but some folks might like a warning before showing these films to the kids.",3,"One good, one bad",1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,1117,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'Paul', 'Naschy', 'did', 'research', 'found', 'many', 'consider', 'be', 'Spanish', 'equivalent', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'must', 'agree', 'first', 'film', 'Night', 'Werewolf', 'pretty', 'good', 'evil', 'witch', 'wanted', 'werewolf', 'control', 'got', 'werewolf', 'missed', 'control', 'part', 'So', 'now', 'angry', 'werewolf', 'evil', 'witch', 'Naschy', 'played', 'werewolf', 'character', 'many', 'times', 'role', 'perfect', '.just', 'Chaney', 'also', 'just', 'Chaney', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'other', 'roles', 'second', 'film', 'Vengeance', 'Zombies', 'pretty', 'bad', 'really', ""n't"", 'Nascy', 'fault', 'script', 'rather', 'poor', 'girls', 'who', 'play', 'zombies', 'are', 'simply', 'terrible', 'give', 'first', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'second', 'film', '2', 'stars', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'werewolf', 'films', 'way', 'films', 'have', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'would', 'probably', 'get', 'R', 'rating', 'not', 'obvious', 'looking', 'cover', 'description', ""n't"", 'bother', 'folks', 'might', 'like', 'warning', 'showing', 'films', 'kids']",N/A
