166905,A3PCTD8QM1BIXI,0800196309,"Derrick Dunn ""The Realest DJ""","[0, 0]",Booty Call is one of the funniest urban films ever made. Jamie Foxx had his first starring role in this film and he showed that he could carry a movie. Tommy Davidson plats second string to Foxx but the two make a great comic team and Vivca Fox is also very sexy in this movie. One has to wonder what would happened if Chris Tucker would have taken this movie on instead of Rush Hour.,4,One of the funniest films of the late nineties,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,384,"['Booty', 'Call', 'one', 'funniest', 'urban', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'had', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'film', 'showed', 'could', 'carry', 'movie', 'Tommy', 'Davidson', 'second', 'string', 'Foxx', 'two', 'make', 'great', 'comic', 'team', 'Vivca', 'Fox', 'also', 'very', 'sexy', 'movie', 'One', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'happened', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'movie', 'instead', 'Rush', 'Hour']",N/A

Don't expect high-brow comedy as this is a comedy that stretches the boundary of good taste and common sense, but it is funny nonetheless.  Some of the scenes are destine to be classics, such as the 7-11 scenes, the plastic wrap, and the impressions scenes.
