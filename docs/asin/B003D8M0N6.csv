I'm giving this 4 stars, while watching season 6 &#34;Not Everybody Loves The Blues&#34; that episode seems to skip at the beginning with Theo & Elvin in the club. Also unlike season 1 that plays all the episodes with one click, season 2-8 are not &#34;play all&#34; friendly, well I guess you get what you pay for.

1337097,A2OKCS5234ZV7S,B003D8M0N6,Flower,"[1, 2]","We own seasons 1-6  and we just purchased seasons seven and eight as we want our children to see what real T.V. and good T.V. shows really are and because we love this T.V. series, its clean fun and funny! Great for family laughs! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch.We read a review saying how this show used to be on Netflix and was for some reason taking off of Netflix, don't know why... But it is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time.. This happen recently and The Cosby Show saved the day! We started season one and before we knew it, it was time to go on to our next destination.So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like the Cosby show so it is in demand!While shopping on Amazon we selected the used copy we wanted and while still shopping someone else purchased the copy we had in our cart so we lost that copy and had to select another copy that cost more. I guess that goes to show how great this show is, everyone is grabbing copies of it.(demand for this show is good)(which is good, because this should show producers that people really want to watch).Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find a used copy for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show! This show could even go for parental education!Bill Cosby is great and we are thankful to enjoy such talent! We wish that the Fatherhood cartoon would be released on DVD. Two seasons on Nick Nite (2004-2005 season run time and has been canceled). and twenty six episodes.. This was a great cartoon with values, please release this on DVD. And also Little Bill on DVD.Happy viewing! And if you are looking for more funny shows, don't for get The PJ's with Eddie Murphy, Martin show, My wife and Kids, Jamie Foxx show, and What's happening! Great shows, real T.V.Shipping was as expected and we are in the process of viewing all the DVD's so we can see how they play!thanks.",5,Good Values and morals thought!,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,3376,"['own', 'seasons', '1-6', 'just', 'purchased', 'seasons', 'seven', 'eight', 'want', 'children', 'see', 'what', 'real', 'T.V', 'good', 'T.V', 'shows', 'really', 'are', 'love', 'T.V', 'series', 'clean', 'fun', 'funny', 'Great', 'family', 'cut', 'cord', 'cable', 'now', 'view', 'TV', 'DVD', 'collection', 'watch', 'Netflix', 'Roku', 'just', 'grew', 'tired', 'paying', 'paid', 'TV', 'nothing', 'good', 'watch.We', 'read', 'review', 'saying', 'how', 'show', 'used', 'be', 'Netflix', 'was', 'reason', 'taking', 'Netflix', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'okay', 'like', 'take', 'DVD', 'road', 'fun', 'times', 'also', 'come', 'handy', 'when', 'are', 'out', 'have', 'wait', 'long', 'periods', 'time..', 'recently', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'saved', 'day', 'started', 'season', 'one', 'knew', 'was', 'time', 'go', 'next', 'destination.So', 'back', 'reason', 'went', 'ahead', 'purchased', 'collection', 'Due', 'garbage', 'T.V', 'days', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'looking', 'great', 'T.V', 'shows', 'are', 'turning', 'shows', 'again', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'tired', 'paying', 'trash', 'T.V', 'have', 'found', 'other', 'ways', 'view', 'T.V', 'way', 'want', 'growing', 'attitudes', 'paid', 'TV', 'days..', 'know', 'many', 'Cosby', 'show', 'demand', 'shopping', 'Amazon', 'selected', 'used', 'copy', 'wanted', 'still', 'shopping', 'someone', 'else', 'purchased', 'copy', 'had', 'cart', 'lost', 'copy', 'had', 'select', 'copy', 'cost', 'more', 'guess', 'show', 'how', 'great', 'show', 'everyone', 'grabbing', 'copies', 'demand', 'show', 'good', 'good', 'should', 'show', 'producers', 'people', 'really', 'want', 'watch', '.Anyway', 'family', 'show', 'glad', 'were', 'still', 'able', 'find', 'used', 'copy', 'decent', 'price..', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'budget', 'are', 'just', 'glad', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'T.V', 'way', 'want', 'not', 'have', 'pay', 'crap', 'TV', 'are', 'tired', 'today', 'T.V', 'shows..', 'really', 'sad', 'good', 'method', 'influence', 'turned', 'trash', 'T.V', 'exception', 'National', 'Geo', 'way', 'want', 'clean', 'T.V', 'can', 'say', 'cut', 'cable', 'have', 'better', 'free', 'life..', 'have', 'more', 'family', 'time', 'time', 'do', 'things', 'want', 'do', 'pay', 'shows', 'want', 'Cosby', 'show', 'not', 'Netflix', 'am', 'glad', 'T.V', 'series', 'available', 'Amazon.This', 'T.V', 'Series', 'lot', 'great', 'lessons', 'also', 'you..', 'Miss', 'days', 'shows', 'So', 'are', 'looking', 'clean', 'great', 'family', 'fun', 'show', 'you..', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'children', 'love', 'show', 'show', 'could', 'even', 'go', 'parental', 'education', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'great', 'are', 'thankful', 'enjoy', 'such', 'talent', 'wish', 'Fatherhood', 'cartoon', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Two', 'seasons', 'Nick', 'Nite', '2004-2005', 'season', 'run', 'time', 'been', 'canceled', 'twenty', 'six', 'episodes..', 'was', 'great', 'cartoon', 'values', 'please', 'release', 'DVD', 'also', 'Little', 'Bill', 'DVD.Happy', 'viewing', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'funny', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'PJ', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Martin', 'show', 'My', 'wife', 'Kids', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'show', 'What', 'happening', 'Great', 'shows', 'real', 'T.V.Shipping', 'was', 'expected', 'are', 'process', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'play', 'thanks']",The Cosby Show: Seasons 5 & 6

However, I had to have all the seasons and when I found out there was a Seasons 5 & 6 DVD for the price of $15, I had to buy it. Now, I thought that this was the two seasons in one case with the cover being how it looks here, in green with the two pictures of Cosby. But no! It was actually the two separate seasons, two DVD sets shrinkwrapped together! So I was amazed at what I received - a great value!

The shows beamed on TV in the 80s present very interesting theatrical based lessons on how couples can balance their family life with competing ends in this dog eat dog world. Of particular interest to me is the role of the father and husband which is uncompromised and yet not threatening to all. The father in particular demonstrates a very and rare balance between selflessly loving his wife and being there always for her and being an understanding father loving all his children equally.
