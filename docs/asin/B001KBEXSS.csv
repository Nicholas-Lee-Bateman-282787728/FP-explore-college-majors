It is very fast paced and I only do it once a week, (but I also do several of Leslie's other dvd's). This dvd really focuses on getting your legs moving and it has helped tone my muscles. The fit cuff is awesome but you will be sore after the first time. My fit cuff snapped after a few months of use, so I tied it in a knot and kept on using it. Then it snapped in another spot, so I finally threw it out and replaced it with a similar resistance tube. Now my fit cuff works just fine. I sometimes just use the fit cuff by itself because its a really good workout for the legs. I would definitely recommend this dvd as one of Leslie's good ones, she really gets your heart pumping.",5,Really works thighs & legs!!,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,737,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'kit', 'about', '1', 'year', 'still', 'enjoy', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'only', 'do', 'once', 'week', 'also', 'do', 'several', 'Leslie', 'other', 'dvd', 'dvd', 'really', 'getting', 'legs', 'moving', 'helped', 'tone', 'muscles', 'fit', 'cuff', 'awesome', 'will', 'be', 'sore', 'first', 'time', 'fit', 'cuff', 'snapped', 'few', 'months', 'use', 'tied', 'knot', 'kept', 'using', 'Then', 'snapped', 'spot', 'so', 'finally', 'threw', 'out', 'replaced', 'similar', 'resistance', 'tube', 'Now', 'fit', 'cuff', 'just', 'fine', 'sometimes', 'just', 'use', 'fit', 'cuff', 'really', 'good', 'workout', 'legs', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'one', 'Leslie', 'good', 'ones', 'really', 'heart', 'pumping']",Leslie Sansone: Walk Away Your Hips & Thighs Kit w/ Fit Cuff

She is her normal, sometimes way too perky self, but it is a good video.  Nice pace and as always easy to follow the directions for what movements are next.  I like the walk band.  It does add a something extra to the workout.  Even if you don't use it all the time, the video is enough to get a good workout for it only being 3 miles.

1207570,A27PG06VFJ1BGY,B001KBEXSS,Johnnie,"[8, 11]","My husband & I have so many of Leslie's walk at home DVD's. Leslie makes it fun to workout with her. Although we love Leslie, sometimes you need to mute the little Darling so you can focus. Nonetheless, she's a wealth of information. In the beginning try not to mute often because you might miss out on the tips, coaching, info and her postive spiritual attitude about life. I've worked out w/ others and felt like I was in the military, worked out with them for a month and quit. Working out with Leslie, Mary Kay, Carol, Linda and the rest of her group is really like working out with fun friends. I reduced inches all over my body, eating healthy, and feel great. I've been with Leslie and her group for over 1 year, use her DVD's 5x's-6x's a week.

1207573,A14OUJJJQZ3BG2,B001KBEXSS,YzGals,"[13, 17]","I like this DVD.  It's more fast paced than say her 5 Mile (even with that boost).  This feels boosted through the 1st mile and into the 2nd mile and then she does do a cool down.  I just keep my pace up to the beat and move faster and still open up on the side steps wider and kick higher and life my knees higher.  You can basically do WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.  I can get my pulse up to 142 in this DVD and have trouble getting it to that on say her 5 Day Slimdown.  I can only get it up to 140 on the 5 Mile.  And with the leg band, I can keep it just between 128-130.  So not bad for doing strength training and keeping the heart rate up.  The time flies by.  I like to throw this DVD in twice a week along with the others and my treadmill/elliptical/resistance tube workouts.",5,Overall nice change of pace!,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,776,"['like', 'DVD', 'more', 'fast', 'paced', 'say', '5', 'Mile', 'even', 'boost', 'feels', 'boosted', '1st', 'mile', '2nd', 'mile', 'then', 'do', 'cool', 'down', 'just', 'keep', 'pace', 'up', 'beat', 'move', 'faster', 'still', 'open', 'up', 'side', 'steps', 'wider', 'kick', 'higher', 'life', 'knees', 'higher', 'can', 'basically', 'do', 'WHAT', 'YOU', 'WANT', 'TO', 'DO', 'can', 'get', 'pulse', 'up', '142', 'DVD', 'have', 'trouble', 'getting', 'say', '5', 'Day', 'Slimdown', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'up', '140', '5', 'Mile', 'leg', 'band', 'can', 'keep', 'just', '128-130', 'not', 'bad', 'doing', 'strength', 'training', 'keeping', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'time', 'flies', 'like', 'throw', 'DVD', 'twice', 'week', 'others', 'treadmill/elliptical/resistance', 'tube', 'workouts']",Leslie Sansone: Walk Away Your Hips & Thighs Kit w/ Fit Cuff
