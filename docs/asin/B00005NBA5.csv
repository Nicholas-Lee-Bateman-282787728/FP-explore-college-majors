667427,A2XZE1TB784HKX,B00005NBA5,"alex fryling ""youngfry""","[0, 0]",I first came upon this CD when I was searching for DVD's and CD's on amazon.com. The reviews looked all good for the most part so I decided to try and find it and I did at my local FYE. I tell you for a $10.00 DVD you will not get a better buy for your money. The one thing that makes this DVD unique is it gets a bunch of people's opinions on the situation of death row records. There is not just one biased opinion everyone side is seen in this DVD. The only 2 people that weren't with us to give us there take was Tupac and B.I.G. R.I.P. That does not mean they were not documented or heard from in this DVD. They had a ton of interviews and classic moments that involved these two rappers. But to start at the beginning was fresh because a lot of people know what happened with the Pac and Biggie situation but not a lot of people know how Death Row came about. It really is quite inspiring when you think about it because at that time in our country we still had a lot of racism. They were talking about the most controversial rap group in history NWA and how they came up. They used lyrics that talked about killing police but in reality they were just getting the message out that maybe the general public did not know what was going on in their community. NWA eventually fell apart because of differences between the members but if anything that propelled their careers as individual artists. This DVD does a great job covering 2 of the greatest rap albums of all time and how they were made and put together that being Dr. Dre's The Chronic and Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle. They go into another part of the movie were the media really is criticizing black rappers for the way they talk about women and all the violence and killing. It is really sad to see that Death Row Records did not last longer than it did because it came up so quick but went away so fast. There were just so many problems after the death of Tupac that they did not recover. But I will say this if you want a history on a lot of went on in rap back in the day get this DVD. You won't be disappointed. It's almost 1:45 minutes long and that's not including the special features. This DVD for me gets a 5/5 easily and a strong recommendation to pick up if you are a rap fan.,5,Welcome to Death Row gives you a great look into the rise of one of the biggest rap companies of all time and its fall as well,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,2249,"['first', 'came', 'CD', 'when', 'was', 'searching', 'DVD', 'CD', 'amazon.com', 'reviews', 'looked', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'decided', 'try', 'find', 'did', 'local', 'FYE', 'tell', '10.00', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'buy', 'money', 'one', 'thing', 'DVD', 'unique', 'bunch', 'people', 'opinions', 'situation', 'death', 'row', 'records', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'biased', 'opinion', 'everyone', 'side', 'seen', 'DVD', 'only', '2', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'give', 'take', 'was', 'Tupac', 'B.I.G', 'R.I.P', 'not', 'mean', 'were', 'not', 'documented', 'heard', 'DVD', 'had', 'ton', 'interviews', 'classic', 'moments', 'involved', 'two', 'rappers', 'start', 'beginning', 'was', 'fresh', 'lot', 'people', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Pac', 'Biggie', 'situation', 'not', 'lot', 'people', 'know', 'how', 'Death', 'Row', 'came', 'about', 'really', 'quite', 'inspiring', 'when', 'think', 'because', 'time', 'country', 'still', 'had', 'lot', 'racism', 'were', 'talking', 'most', 'controversial', 'rap', 'group', 'history', 'NWA', 'how', 'came', 'up', 'used', 'lyrics', 'talked', 'killing', 'police', 'reality', 'were', 'just', 'getting', 'message', 'out', 'maybe', 'general', 'public', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'community', 'NWA', 'eventually', 'fell', 'apart', 'differences', 'members', 'anything', 'propelled', 'careers', 'individual', 'artists', 'DVD', 'great', 'job', 'covering', '2', 'greatest', 'rap', 'albums', 'time', 'how', 'were', 'made', 'put', 'together', 'being', 'Dr.', 'Dre', 'Chronic', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Doggystyle', 'go', 'part', 'movie', 'were', 'media', 'really', 'criticizing', 'black', 'rappers', 'way', 'talk', 'women', 'violence', 'killing', 'really', 'sad', 'see', 'Death', 'Row', 'Records', 'did', 'not', 'last', 'longer', 'did', 'came', 'up', 'so', 'quick', 'went', 'away', 'so', 'fast', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'death', 'Tupac', 'did', 'not', 'recover', 'will', 'say', 'want', 'history', 'lot', 'went', 'rap', 'back', 'day', 'get', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'almost', '1:45', 'minutes', 'long', 'not', 'including', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', '5/5', 'easily', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'pick', 'up', 'are', 'rap', 'fan']",N/A

667429,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,B00005NBA5,Crazy Jim,"[2, 2]","Leigh Savidge takes a very insightful look at the controversial Death Row Records as well as the music industry as a whole. With never-before-seen footage and comments from several former artists on Death Row as well as many music industry insiders, &quot;Welcome To Death Row&quot; tries its best and succeeds quite well at piecing together all of the shocking details about what really went down behind close doors at Death Row.&quot;Welcome&quot; chronicles all of the major moments in the Death Row saga from its inception when Suge used questionable tactics to get Dr. Dre out of his contract with Eazy-E's Ruthless Records to its downfall following Knight's incarceration. It talks about all the politics and jealousy behind the scenes and details Knight and Death Row's involvment in the infamous East-West battle. It also showcases how producer/artist Dr. Dre helped build the company, only to be pushed to the side when Knight signed Tupac Shakur in 1996 and how Dre eventually chose to leave the multi-million dollar company that he had helped build with Suge.While Suge has been very vocal in his disdain for this documentary, it should be noted that it does not focuss its entire energy on attacking the label boss. While there are some unflattering stories about him told by former employees, there are a number of people who praise him for being a creative genius and a very successful businessman. However, there are also a number of people including imprisoned former crime boss, Michael &quot;Harry-O&quot; Harris, who claim that they helped fund Death Row with drug money. Harris goes into detail about a number of violent incidents involving Suge and how he believes that the success transformed Knight into a different person. Vibe columnist, Kevin Powell, brings a lot to the table as well in his interviews as he provides a lot of insight into the careers of many of the Death Row artists. Snoop Dogg, one of Death Row's most popular artists, also provides some intriuging commentary as he explains what really went on at &quot;Tha Row&quot;.Even if you are only a casual fan of rap music, you should find a lot to like about this very well-made documentary. While some Death Row fans might be upset that it doesn't say much of anything about popular artists like Kurupt, Daz, DJ Quik, or The Outlawz, it really isn't trying to be an artist profile. It also does not feature any music by Death Row because the label wanted nothing to do with its release. Regardless, this is without question, one of the most informative documentaries ever made on the subject of Death Row Records.",5,&quot;Welcome To Death Row&quot; Review,1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,2603,"['Leigh', 'Savidge', 'very', 'insightful', 'look', 'controversial', 'Death', 'Row', 'Records', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'industry', 'whole', 'never-before-seen', 'footage', 'comments', 'several', 'former', 'artists', 'Death', 'Row', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'music', 'industry', 'insiders', 'quot', 'Welcome', 'Death', 'Row', 'quot', 'best', 'quite', 'well', 'piecing', 'together', 'shocking', 'details', 'what', 'really', 'went', 'down', 'behind', 'close', 'doors', 'Death', 'Row.', 'quot', 'Welcome', 'quot', 'major', 'moments', 'Death', 'Row', 'saga', 'inception', 'when', 'Suge', 'used', 'questionable', 'tactics', 'get', 'Dr.', 'Dre', 'contract', 'Eazy-E', 'Ruthless', 'Records', 'downfall', 'following', 'Knight', 'incarceration', 'politics', 'jealousy', 'scenes', 'details', 'Knight', 'Death', 'Row', 'involvment', 'infamous', 'East-West', 'battle', 'also', 'how', 'producer/artist', 'Dr.', 'Dre', 'helped', 'build', 'company', 'only', 'be', 'pushed', 'side', 'when', 'Knight', 'signed', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', '1996', 'how', 'Dre', 'eventually', 'chose', 'leave', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'company', 'had', 'helped', 'build', 'Suge.While', 'Suge', 'been', 'very', 'vocal', 'disdain', 'documentary', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'not', 'focuss', 'entire', 'energy', 'attacking', 'label', 'boss', 'are', 'unflattering', 'stories', 'told', 'former', 'employees', 'are', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'praise', 'being', 'creative', 'genius', 'very', 'successful', 'businessman', 'However', 'are', 'also', 'number', 'people', 'including', 'imprisoned', 'former', 'crime', 'boss', 'Michael', 'quot', 'Harry-O', 'quot', 'Harris', 'who', 'claim', 'helped', 'fund', 'Death', 'Row', 'drug', 'money', 'Harris', 'detail', 'number', 'violent', 'incidents', 'involving', 'Suge', 'how', 'success', 'transformed', 'Knight', 'different', 'person', 'Vibe', 'columnist', 'Kevin', 'Powell', 'lot', 'table', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'lot', 'insight', 'careers', 'many', 'Death', 'Row', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'one', 'Death', 'Row', 'most', 'popular', 'artists', 'also', 'intriuging', 'commentary', 'what', 'really', 'went', 'quot', 'Tha', 'Row', 'quot', 'are', 'only', 'casual', 'fan', 'rap', 'music', 'should', 'find', 'lot', 'like', 'very', 'well-made', 'documentary', 'Death', 'Row', 'fans', 'might', 'be', 'upset', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'anything', 'popular', 'artists', 'Kurupt', 'Daz', 'DJ', 'Quik', 'Outlawz', 'really', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'artist', 'profile', 'also', 'not', 'feature', 'music', 'Death', 'Row', 'label', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'do', 'release', 'Regardless', 'question', 'one', 'most', 'informative', 'documentaries', 'ever', 'made', 'subject', 'Death', 'Row', 'Records']",N/A

667437,A2LCZYW6FBUS8O,B00005NBA5,"Knyte ""To The Stars""","[16, 16]","For me, this film raised a lot of interesting questions -- like for one, in the wake of the damaging press on Death Row's alleged ""drug money"" funding, why hadn't Interscope heads Jimmy Iovine or Ted Fields ever been questioned? When Death Row received all the bad press during the East Coast/West Coast feud, or when stories of Death Row's alleged brutality in their studios came to light, how and why did Jimmy Iovine and Ted Fields come away unscathed, with not so much as one speculative article? These two guys literally owe their fortunes (about $400 million from Death Row) to Suge Knight and the rest of Death Row records, who only saw about half as much. Interscope Records was going out of business -- the Chronic album saved it...I have never witnessed interviews as candid and intriguing as these, and from such a wide variety of (as far as I can tell) credible sources. For me, the value of this documentary isn't so much in the slandering of anyone's name. Rather, ""Welcome To Death Row"" provides extremely valuable lessons on the pitfalls of show BUSINESS, because it is a business (Jerry Heller, David Kenner, Ted Fields, and Jimmy Iovine never forgot that!). Snoop Dogg has over 10 minutes of an interview where he discusses his very beginnings. We get to hear from a man named Michael Harris, and I'll leave that at that. Folks at S.O.L.A.R. records, (where Babyface got his start), early Nate Dogg, D.O.C., Death Row's launch party, it's all here. My man Kevin Powell (the only journalist to ever really get close to the late Tupac Shakur) also adds some great insights. Right now you are reading the words of a highly impressed reviewer.Your viewing experience of this film will not be complete without the DVD extras. If you don't have a DVD player, buy a DVD player; Snoop's solo interview (DVD only) is by far one of the best segments on here.

""Welcome to Death Row"" is a thought-provoking documentary that tells the story of how a dangerous and popular record label changed the music industry, and how it all came falling apart.  The documentary is filmed with new interviews with Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and other former Death Row artists, as well as interviews with big names in both the music and media industry.  They tell their side of the story and reveal just what exactly went on while working for Death Row.I found this documentary to be extremely fascinating and well-done.  It seems to stick with the facts for the most part, instead of reverting to a bunch of conspiracy theories.  There's enough respected people who appeared on the film, which makes it easier to believe.  While it answers some questions, it doesn't answer all of them.  We still to this day do not know who shot Tupac and for what reason.  And although it reveals most of what went on at Death Row, I am sure there are more untold stories that have yet to see the light of day.The DVD is really impressive for a documentary.  It's shot in widescreen, which is something I wasn't expecting.  The picture and sound quality is really good.  The extra features are also very impressive and make their presence felt.  Some of the features are extensive interview outtakes, commentary from the filmmaker, the trailer, and more.""Welcome to Death Row"" is an intriguing and interesting documentary.  Filled with things we had known all along and things we never knew, this is a documentary worth watching over and over again.  You don't even have to be a big rap fan to enjoy it.  If you know enough about the record label's history and you are a music fan, I think you'll really find this all interesting.

I was blown away by the style and production of this movie. Two huge things make this documentary worth wild. First off the film is completely impartial. You just get the facts and opinions of those directly involved and few from those outside. The other factor is that other people who aren't rap fans will find this interesting. After my viewing I showed this to many friends and all were deeply interested despite any real interest in rap music. Great topic because of it's controversy and it's impact over the nation.

While there are no huge revelations included here, it is a fascinating insight into the notorious hip-hop label, that was running rap music in the early to mid 90's.  Most of the main players are interviwed here, Dre, Snoop, Suge and Harry-O.  It charts their massive rise after releasing The Chronic and then Doggystyle the next year and then where it all started to go wrong, when Suge Knight started to bask in his new found fame.  Some of the accounts show exactly how ruthless Suge was, though i suspect there are even more untold stories involving him.  The seocnd half of the dvd deals mainly with Tupac, and then how Death Row completely fell apart, with Dre leaving and then Pac's death.  If you have any interest in the hip-hop industry i would urge you to buy this, the only criticisms i have are that there are no interviws with David Kenner (Death Row Lawyer) or anyone at Interscope Records like Jimmy Iovine, though im not surprised they were unavailable to comment.

667443,ABS34T7YMLG1K,B00005NBA5,"Wayne Maye ""Creative Cancer""","[1, 3]","I've been a fan of Death Row Records since 1992, when they dropped the LEGENDARY album The Chronic by Dr.Dre, and later Snoop's LEGENDARY debut album Doggystyle. Everything was all good until situations, planned or unplanned, caused the company to spiral out of control and crumble. Due to the legal problems, Dre leaving the company, and all things related caused Death Row's unfortunate and untimely demise. Now, normally I would review what's on the DVD, so what I'll do is basically talk about how AWESOME and REAL this dvd is, as opposed to giving aways what's on the dvd. The way the rise and fall of Death Row is told here by Suge, Dre, Snoop, Nate Dogg, and others in nothing short of amazing. We start in the very beginning to when NWA was formed in the mid 80s to the end when Dre left the company. All of the information here, I knew some of it before I saw it for the first time. But the information told here that I DIDN'T know before surprised me. @ times during this film, it's SO intense that you just can't help being captivated by the content. Don't believe me? In addition to the individuals telling the story, look @ the eyes of Lydia Harris and Simone Green. As you look @ their eyes when they tell the parts of the story, you're immediately drawn into the emotions of the storytelling. Also, all of the pieces of information are blended together superbly. NO history and incident is forgotten here, and you receive everything you could possibly know about the rise and fall of Death Row Records. Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dvd to any fan, long time fans, new fans, etc. You won't regret this purchase, and like me, after the first viewing, you're going to view this dvd repeatedly. It's just that good.LONG LIVE DEATH ROW!!!",5,The GREATEST documentary EVER!!!,1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,1752,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Death', 'Row', 'Records', '1992', 'when', 'dropped', 'LEGENDARY', 'album', 'Chronic', 'Dr.Dre', 'later', 'Snoop', 'LEGENDARY', 'debut', 'album', 'Doggystyle', 'Everything', 'was', 'good', 'situations', 'planned', 'unplanned', 'caused', 'company', 'spiral', 'control', 'crumble', 'Due', 'legal', 'problems', 'Dre', 'leaving', 'company', 'things', 'related', 'caused', 'Death', 'Row', 'unfortunate', 'untimely', 'demise', 'Now', 'normally', 'would', 'review', 'what', 'DVD', 'what', ""'ll"", 'do', 'basically', 'talk', 'how', 'AWESOME', 'REAL', 'dvd', 'opposed', 'giving', 'aways', 'what', 'dvd', 'way', 'rise', 'fall', 'Death', 'Row', 'told', 'here', 'Suge', 'Dre', 'Snoop', 'Nate', 'Dogg', 'others', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'start', 'very', 'beginning', 'when', 'NWA', 'was', 'formed', 'mid', '80s', 'end', 'when', 'Dre', 'left', 'company', 'information', 'here', 'knew', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'information', 'told', 'here', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'know', 'surprised', '@', 'times', 'film', 'SO', 'intense', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'captivated', 'content', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'addition', 'individuals', 'telling', 'story', 'look', 'eyes', 'Lydia', 'Harris', 'Simone', 'Green', 'look', '@', 'eyes', 'when', 'tell', 'parts', 'story', ""'re"", 'immediately', 'drawn', 'emotions', 'storytelling', 'Also', 'pieces', 'information', 'are', 'blended', 'together', 'superbly', 'NO', 'history', 'incident', 'forgotten', 'here', 'receive', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'know', 'rise', 'fall', 'Death', 'Row', 'Records', 'Overall', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMEND', 'dvd', 'fan', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'new', 'fans', 'etc', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'purchase', 'first', 'viewing', ""'re"", 'going', 'view', 'dvd', 'repeatedly', 'just', 'good.LONG', 'LIVE', 'DEATH', 'ROW']",N/A
