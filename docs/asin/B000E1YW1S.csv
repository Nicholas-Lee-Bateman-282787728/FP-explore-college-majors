966547,A1SOZ51PECGR0E,B000E1YW1S,Bianca Vandenbos,"[1, 2]",I liked it but this film could have done better. And it was very confusing. Because in the first film The Lady of the Lake was a good witch and she dies at the end. Where as in this movie shes evil and wants to destroy Camelot. And she took Merlins magic and made herself pregnant with his baby? I'm like yuck! INCEST PEOPLE!! REALLY? That woman was his aunt in the first film cause Mab was Merlins mother and sister to the Lady of the Lake. I thought it was a good film it could have done better it could have done worse kind of deal but the first film was better than the second. And I think it would have done worse if Sam Neil wasn't in the movie as Merlin at all and they could have picked some bonehead actor that can't act to play him. It wasn't the worse but it could have done better. Also to explain the bad movie a chinese man named David Wu directed this sequel instead of sticking with the one who directed the original film. I'm not saying it to be mean or steryotypical but I don't think he watched the first film and maybe being that hes asian he probably never heard of the first film or the legends of Merlin. Again not trying to be mean or steryotypical.,3,Could have done better could have done worse!

966548,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B000E1YW1S,blackaciddevil,"[1, 1]","Directed by David Wu, Merlin's Apprentice tells the story of Merlin joining forces with a young thief with untapped magic powers of his own (engaging Canadian actor John Reardon) in a quest to recover the lost Holy Grail, which holds the key to Camelot's protection and survival. Thing is, about halfways through, Merlin finds out that this young thief happens to be his son(how is THAT for a plot twist, folks?). As you may have noticed by reading other reviews here, it's storyline doesn't pick up where the first film left off. This movie takes place some 50 years later with Merlin waking from a long nap. It has little to do with the first film and has more of an alternate story timeline.While this movie is good for a fantasy film by itself, it is not good as a sequel to the first film. I wish I could be more forgiving of this movie but it lacks direction, story, special effects, even acting as opposed to the original. Like one reviewer pointed out, it is a sequel in name only. It was a bit disappointing to me that it was done this way.  The only saving grace to this movie is the performances by Sam Neill & Miranda Richardson. As expected, their roles were dead-on to the ones in the previous movie.I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you can get past the fact that this is a sequel to the first film, overall- Merlin's Apprentice is a watchable movie. If you're expecting it to be as great as the first film, well---it just isn't happening. It doesn't hit that mark of excellence and you'll go away quite disappointed. All I can say is rent before you buy....not unless you get it in a bargain bin like I did.Let me state one more thing before I close this review, the company that made this movie makes great movies. Their record has more hits than it does misses so don't let one movie blemishe you picking up any of their other movies.

966549,A3N6AN218WXLXP,B000E1YW1S,"Bryan Leech ""Bryan""","[12, 12]","Having watched Hallmark's 'Merlin' and being impressed by it, I turned to this film, expecting a sequel. This is where most of the other reviews have gone wrong. It most definitely is not a sequel to 'Merlin', but a companion story.This fact is obvious right from the start, where the Camelot we find is very different to the Camelot at the end of 'Merlin', as is Merlin himself, even though the character is played again by Sam Neill, who handles the role deliciously in both mini-series. So be prepared to see a totally new story which draws on the Camelot legends for its basis, but follows none of them.This new story starts slowly from a demolished Camelot. Merlin has been in hibernation for 50 years, but a young, undisciplined magician, as yet not very skilled, has appeared to partly fill the gap created by the missing Merlin. Merlin returns and with the remnants of the citizens of Camelot sets out to create a new Camelot. Along the way, he acquires the afore-mentioned young magician as an apprentice.The story is beautifully constructed, slowly developing, taking on twists and turns and leading to an ending which the cynical might see as corny, but the lover of such fantasies will see as almost inspiring. Some of the dialog can be a little pedestrian, but most is quite competent and at times rises to scenes of near-brilliance.As in its earlier companion film, 'Merlin', the technical aspects of film making are excellent. The photography is of quite a high standard, as is the editing, but they are both handled in such a responsible way that they do not draw attention to themselves. Color and 5.1 sound on this widescreen film are also excellent. And, an important contribution to most films, it has a delightful music score.Although a different director to 'Merlin', the direction skillfully draws together all the elements of the film to create a result which I thought was superior to 'Merlin'. Certainly it had less special effects, at least obvious ones. but I don't watch a film for its special effects, I watch for the telling of a good story or the exposition of a good character study. And in this I found quite a good story. As in 'Merlin', neither the story or the film is a masterpiece, but at least there is a solid well-developed story, a rarity in most films.I was slightly disappointed in the acting of the pivotal character, the apprentice. The character portrayed was exactly right for the story and he looked very good for the part. Unfortunately, his acting was marred by a little rigidity. However, he got away with this failing. Surprisingly, Miranda Richardson, the focus of evil in the story, was unusually bland.In total, I thought this a good film, not one to go down in history, but superior to most of what we see in our cinemas (this is a TV two-part mini-series). If you like this type of fantasy, buy it. But don't expect a sequel to 'Merlin' or any other Arthurian film you have seen. It is a new story that stands alone from the rest. Approach it as any sort of sequel and you will be disappointed. Approach it on its own merits, and you should experience enjoyable viewing.",5,A new tale about Merlin and Camelot,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,3129,"['Having', 'watched', 'Hallmark', ""'Merlin"", 'being', 'impressed', 'turned', 'film', 'expecting', 'sequel', 'where', 'most', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'gone', 'wrong', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'sequel', ""'Merlin"", 'companion', 'story.This', 'fact', 'obvious', 'right', 'start', 'where', 'Camelot', 'find', 'very', 'different', 'Camelot', 'end', ""'Merlin"", 'Merlin', 'even', 'character', 'played', 'again', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'who', 'role', 'deliciously', 'mini-series', 'So', 'be', 'prepared', 'see', 'totally', 'new', 'story', 'Camelot', 'basis', 'none', 'them.This', 'new', 'story', 'slowly', 'demolished', 'Camelot', 'Merlin', 'been', 'hibernation', '50', 'years', 'young', 'undisciplined', 'magician', 'yet', 'not', 'very', 'skilled', 'appeared', 'partly', 'fill', 'gap', 'created', 'missing', 'Merlin', 'Merlin', 'returns', 'remnants', 'citizens', 'Camelot', 'out', 'create', 'new', 'Camelot', 'way', 'afore-mentioned', 'young', 'magician', 'apprentice.The', 'story', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'slowly', 'developing', 'taking', 'twists', 'turns', 'leading', 'ending', 'cynical', 'might', 'see', 'corny', 'lover', 'such', 'fantasies', 'will', 'see', 'almost', 'inspiring', 'dialog', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'pedestrian', 'most', 'quite', 'competent', 'times', 'rises', 'scenes', 'near-brilliance.As', 'earlier', 'companion', 'film', ""'Merlin"", 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'making', 'are', 'excellent', 'photography', 'quite', 'high', 'standard', 'editing', 'are', 'handled', 'such', 'responsible', 'way', 'do', 'not', 'draw', 'attention', 'Color', '5.1', 'sound', 'widescreen', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'important', 'contribution', 'most', 'films', 'delightful', 'music', 'different', 'director', ""'Merlin"", 'direction', 'skillfully', 'together', 'elements', 'film', 'create', 'result', 'thought', 'was', 'superior', ""'Merlin"", 'Certainly', 'had', 'less', 'special', 'effects', 'least', 'obvious', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'watch', 'telling', 'good', 'story', 'exposition', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'found', 'quite', 'good', 'story', ""'Merlin"", 'story', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'least', 'solid', 'well-developed', 'story', 'rarity', 'most', 'films.I', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'acting', 'pivotal', 'character', 'apprentice', 'character', 'portrayed', 'was', 'exactly', 'right', 'story', 'looked', 'very', 'good', 'part', 'Unfortunately', 'acting', 'was', 'marred', 'little', 'rigidity', 'However', 'got', 'away', 'failing', 'Surprisingly', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'focus', 'evil', 'story', 'was', 'unusually', 'bland.In', 'total', 'thought', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'superior', 'most', 'what', 'see', 'cinemas', 'TV', 'two-part', 'mini-series', 'like', 'type', 'fantasy', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'sequel', ""'Merlin"", 'other', 'Arthurian', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'new', 'story', 'alone', 'rest', 'Approach', 'sort', 'sequel', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Approach', 'own', 'merits', 'should', 'experience', 'enjoyable', 'viewing']",N/A

Either they are unoriginal, poorly acted, or absolutely butcher the book they're based on. It does not surprise me that Hallmark decided to cash in on the popularity of Sam Neil as Merlin for a second go-around. What did surprise me this time around was that it's more appropriate for younger audiences... and a lot of fun to watch.All is well in Camelot. King Arthur and his knights are in possession of the Holy Grail and Merlin (Sam Neil) has decided to sleep for a season in order to rest from his taxing adventures in building the city's magical defenses. When he awakens, it has been fifty years and Camelot lies in ruin. Arthur and most of his knights are dead, and the Holy Grail vanished due to the drunken debauchery of newfound leadership. King Griffyth (Andrew Kavadas) is determined to restore goodness to Camelot, and has become engaged to the beautiful Lady Yvonne (Tegan Moss), last living heir of the original knight Sir Gawain. But Yvonne is actually in love with a knight, Graham (Christopher Jacot). As Merlin attempts to discern where the Holy Grail has gone, into his life comes a masterful young thief.Jack (John Reardon) is somewhat inept in many of his magical tricks but is a tolerable pickpocket. Making the mistake of attempting to steal Merlin's wand, Jack inadvertently reveals to the master wizard that he possesses knowledge enough to assist him in learning where the Grail has been concealed. Camelot is in need of it, if peace is to be restored to the land. The peasants have arisen in revolt, raging their way through the surrounding countryside under the protection of the enchantress of the lake (Miranda Richardson). Much of the production relies on the humor to be found in the characters. Jack is one of the most likable heroes I've seen on the small screen in a long time. He keeps a pig for company and has some fabulous one-liners. Most of Neil's participation takes place in the first half; after that, the story takes a turn and Jack is foremost and center, along with a host of other talented young actors.There are times when the story seems a little over-drawn, but I was never bored. One of my only complaints would be that it doesn't have a great deal of magic, and what it does contain is not entirely original. Later scenes consist of memory-probing in a fashion that felt overly familiar -- because it's not that much different from British fantasy author J.K. Rowling's similar uses in the Harry Potter books. What magic there is remains memorable -- arising three-dimensional maps from dust, creating fog to conceal wandering wizards on a spying mission, and lifting stones to form a bridge in the sky. Characters are two-dimensional and often surprising. One of the better minor plots is about a female knight who is determined to prove her way in a man's world. The mistake here is assuming that this is a sequel to the enormously popular Merlin. It isn't. Aside from Merlin himself, there are no similarities. In fact, this film contradicts much of the first one, in everything from the presence of the Holy Grail to the absence of Merlin's wife. The original is much deeper and more cleverly crafted, but this one is more appropriate for children, since it doesn't contain the troubling aspects of adultery, and incest.",3,not bad,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,3320,"['Decent', 'fantasy', 'films', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'are', 'unoriginal', 'poorly', 'acted', 'absolutely', 'book', ""'re"", 'based', 'not', 'surprise', 'Hallmark', 'decided', 'cash', 'popularity', 'Sam', 'Neil', 'Merlin', 'second', 'go-around', 'What', 'did', 'surprise', 'time', 'around', 'was', 'more', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'audiences', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch.All', 'well', 'Camelot', 'King', 'Arthur', 'knights', 'are', 'possession', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Merlin', 'Sam', 'Neil', 'decided', 'sleep', 'season', 'order', 'rest', 'taxing', 'adventures', 'building', 'city', 'magical', 'defenses', 'When', 'been', 'fifty', 'years', 'Camelot', 'ruin', 'Arthur', 'most', 'knights', 'are', 'dead', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'vanished', 'due', 'drunken', 'debauchery', 'newfound', 'leadership', 'King', 'Griffyth', 'Andrew', 'Kavadas', 'determined', 'restore', 'goodness', 'Camelot', 'become', 'engaged', 'beautiful', 'Lady', 'Yvonne', 'Tegan', 'Moss', 'last', 'living', 'heir', 'original', 'knight', 'Sir', 'Gawain', 'Yvonne', 'actually', 'love', 'knight', 'Graham', 'Christopher', 'Jacot', 'Merlin', 'discern', 'where', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'gone', 'life', 'masterful', 'young', 'thief.Jack', 'John', 'Reardon', 'somewhat', 'inept', 'many', 'magical', 'tricks', 'tolerable', 'pickpocket', 'Making', 'mistake', 'attempting', 'steal', 'Merlin', 'wand', 'Jack', 'inadvertently', 'master', 'wizard', 'enough', 'assist', 'learning', 'where', 'Grail', 'been', 'concealed', 'Camelot', 'need', 'peace', 'be', 'restored', 'land', 'peasants', 'have', 'arisen', 'revolt', 'raging', 'way', 'surrounding', 'countryside', 'protection', 'enchantress', 'lake', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Much', 'production', 'relies', 'humor', 'be', 'found', 'characters', 'Jack', 'one', 'most', 'likable', 'heroes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'small', 'screen', 'long', 'time', 'pig', 'company', 'fabulous', 'one-liners', 'Most', 'Neil', 'participation', 'place', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'turn', 'Jack', 'foremost', 'center', 'host', 'other', 'talented', 'young', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'story', 'little', 'over-drawn', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'One', 'only', 'complaints', 'would', 'be', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'magic', 'what', 'contain', 'not', 'entirely', 'original', 'Later', 'scenes', 'consist', 'memory-probing', 'fashion', 'felt', 'overly', 'familiar', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'different', 'British', 'fantasy', 'author', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'similar', 'uses', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'What', 'magic', 'memorable', 'arising', 'three-dimensional', 'maps', 'dust', 'creating', 'fog', 'conceal', 'wandering', 'wizards', 'spying', 'mission', 'lifting', 'stones', 'form', 'bridge', 'sky', 'Characters', 'are', 'two-dimensional', 'often', 'surprising', 'One', 'better', 'minor', 'plots', 'female', 'knight', 'who', 'determined', 'prove', 'way', 'man', 'world', 'mistake', 'here', 'assuming', 'sequel', 'enormously', 'popular', 'Merlin', ""n't"", 'Aside', 'Merlin', 'are', 'similarities', 'fact', 'film', 'much', 'first', 'one', 'everything', 'presence', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'absence', 'Merlin', 'wife', 'original', 'much', 'deeper', 'more', 'cleverly', 'crafted', 'one', 'more', 'appropriate', 'children', ""n't"", 'contain', 'troubling', 'aspects', 'adultery', 'incest']",N/A

966553,A21KM4ZAKY9U9S,B000E1YW1S,Chrome Oxide,"[1, 1]","Merlin's Appendix, oops, I mean Apprentice might have been more interesting had the scriptwriter actually watched the original miniseries and cared about it rather then the number of words he needed to put on paper to receive his paycheck.  If he had, he would not have needed to make up everything from scratch, retaining only some of the names, and the vaguest relationship to their character from the first miniseries.Since the first miniseries had Merlin living to a ripe old age and killing Queen Mab, an evil sorceress, where did they think to start?  Sometime after Queen Mab was killed but before Merlin grew old.  At this point in time, the Holy Grail is missing, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are long dead.  Camelot is just another medieval castle full of peasants and ignobility.All stories need conflict of some kind.  Since Queen Mab was already dead, they replaced her with a new villainess, The Lady In The Lake.  In this miniseries, instead of supplying Excaliber to Merlin to help build Camelot, The Lady In The Lake instead is working to destroy any hope of rebuilding Camelot.  They never explained how she went from a minor low power character in the prior miniseries to a very powerful witch intent on destroying Camelot.Additional conflict is provided by the king's trusted advisors being traitors plotting to sell out the king and remnants of Camelot to other people who are looking for indentured servants (slaves).The appendix, I mean apprentice, isn't much of an apprentice.  As the child of Merlin (who was raped while is was sleeping for 50 years) and The Lady In The Lake (who raped him to have the child), the appendix must have magical ability.  Although they never explain why after going to so much trouble to have a child with Merlin as the father, The Lady doesn't bother with raising the appendix herself or placing the appendix in a home where he would be taught whatever The Lady wants him to know.The miniseries starts with the appendix as an adult who is barely competent with magic.  When he meets with Merlin, Merlin doesn't recognize the magical ability or heredity of the appendix.  After a few short days / weeks in Merlin's presence, the appendix is capable of negating Merlin's spells.  So much for the great and powerful Merlin.Merlin also makes many mistakes and misunderstand many situations in the miniseries.  Merlin doesn't recognize the traitors in the castle.  Merlin doesn't recognize that the current king is the main reason why the Holy Grail won't return to Camelot.  He and his appendix spy on The Lady and believes the lies The Lady spouts to a subordinate to confuse Merlin.When Merlin realizes that the lies The Lady spoke to confuse him are lies, he sends a blacksmith to tell his appendix not to do a dumb thing.  They never explain what Merlin was doing that was so important that he couldn't deliver the message himself.  Anyway, because the blacksmith delivers the message, the appendix ignores it, opening up the castle so that the besieging army can invade through a secret passage.Amazingly Merlin does show up now to help anyone the invaders hasn't managed to slaughter.  In the process, Merlin is killed.The king, leading the survivors, runs away from the invading army.  The appendix leads them hopefully towards the Holy Grail.  They never explain adequately why The Lady shows the appendix where the Holy Grail is rather than a phony substitute.  But when they arrive at the waterfall where the Holy Grail is hidden, it is protected by a creature that kills the first person that tries to retrieve it.While trying to figure out what to do next, the following army arrives and slaughters everyone except the King and the appendix.  The appendix finally figures out how to get past the guardian and the king grabs the Holy Grail and goes up in a puff of smoke.  Evidently he was evil, but you must take that on faith, as throughout the prior 3 hours, he doesn't act any worse than you would expect for a king.Now, finally the moment we have all been waiting for.  The last 10 minutes of the movie.  The point where I finally want to hurl a rock through the screen and gouge my eyes out.The appendix grabs the Holy Grail, everyone who was just slaughtered is revived, and the appendix declares that a new Camelot will be built.

966555,A2ZCXIZHS191TG,B000E1YW1S,Fred Anonymous Smith,"[4, 7]","Any fan of the Camelot legend will be appalled by this movie. Typical of today's thinking, where everything good must be twisted into bad, this movie portrays Camelot, and everyone associated with it, as an evil which must be vanquished from the Earth..The Lady of the Lake, a wise and benign character in the Camelot legend, is the evil sorceress in this movie - in the same manner as Queen Mab in the first movie. Indeed, the Lady of the Lake is even played by the same actress playing Queen Mab in the first movie (Miranda Richardson).In this movie, Merlin (once again played by Sam Neill) can only be described as confused, incompetent, and even pathetic - an obvious attempt to dismiss the old (Merlin) and bring in the new (Jack). However, the portrayal of the elderly as confused and incompetent is simply insulting. Luckily for viewers, this wretched character is killed in the first half of the movie, leaving Merlin's untrained apprentice as the focal point for magic throughout the remainder of the movie.The apprentice, Jack (played by John Reardon), a thief and rogue with few redeeming characteristics, soon learns Melin and the Lady of the Lake are his parents (a magical union) and the source of his burgeoning magic.  Brianna, his masculine girlfriend (played by Meghan Ory), dressed as a man (Brian) seeking knighthood (mediaeval gender wars), is absurdly able to easily defeat much larger and much stronger men in battle.Fairly early in the movie, Camelot is sacked and destroyed, leaving it's remaining people to flee, under the guidence of Jack, in a quest for the Holy Grail to restore Camelot. But, towards the end of the movie, everyone from Camelot is killed (very graphic violence), only to be brought back to life by the magical Holy Grail - each learning from their ""mistakes"" somewhere in the process. They swear to rebuild Camelot.The movie ends with the masculine Brian (or Brianna) in Jack's arms, both heading off to spend, to quote the movie, an ""auspicious night for sowing the seeds of next year's harvest.""In conclusion, this movie trashes the Camelot legend. The acting is poor. The story and script are simplistic. And one certainly hopes few will truly identify with the boorish, somewhat lowlife, characters in the movie (played so well by the seemingly analogous actors). Mixed into all this is a flood of gratuitous violence mixed with childlike humor (in a movie absolutely no child should see and most adults will want to skip), a talking pig, and other such absurd nonsense.",1,Merlin's Apprentice - Trashes the Camelot Legend,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,2520,"['fan', 'Camelot', 'legend', 'will', 'be', 'appalled', 'movie', 'Typical', 'today', 'thinking', 'where', 'everything', 'good', 'must', 'be', 'twisted', 'bad', 'movie', 'Camelot', 'everyone', 'associated', 'evil', 'must', 'be', 'vanquished', 'Earth..The', 'Lady', 'Lake', 'wise', 'benign', 'character', 'Camelot', 'legend', 'evil', 'sorceress', 'movie', 'same', 'manner', 'Queen', 'Mab', 'first', 'movie', 'Indeed', 'Lady', 'Lake', 'even', 'played', 'same', 'actress', 'playing', 'Queen', 'Mab', 'first', 'movie', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', '.In', 'movie', 'Merlin', 'once', 'again', 'played', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'confused', 'incompetent', 'even', 'pathetic', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'dismiss', 'old', 'Merlin', 'bring', 'new', 'Jack', 'However', 'portrayal', 'elderly', 'confused', 'incompetent', 'simply', 'insulting', 'Luckily', 'viewers', 'wretched', 'character', 'killed', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'leaving', 'Merlin', 'untrained', 'apprentice', 'focal', 'point', 'magic', 'remainder', 'movie.The', 'apprentice', 'Jack', 'played', 'John', 'Reardon', 'thief', 'rogue', 'few', 'redeeming', 'characteristics', 'soon', 'Melin', 'Lady', 'Lake', 'are', 'parents', 'magical', 'union', 'source', 'burgeoning', 'magic', 'Brianna', 'masculine', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Meghan', 'Ory', 'dressed', 'man', 'Brian', 'seeking', 'knighthood', 'mediaeval', 'gender', 'wars', 'absurdly', 'able', 'easily', 'defeat', 'much', 'larger', 'much', 'stronger', 'men', 'battle.Fairly', 'early', 'movie', 'Camelot', 'sacked', 'destroyed', 'leaving', 'remaining', 'people', 'flee', 'guidence', 'Jack', 'quest', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'restore', 'Camelot', 'end', 'movie', 'everyone', 'Camelot', 'killed', 'very', 'graphic', 'violence', 'only', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'magical', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'learning', 'mistakes', 'somewhere', 'process', 'swear', 'rebuild', 'Camelot.The', 'movie', 'masculine', 'Brian', 'Brianna', 'Jack', 'arms', 'heading', 'off', 'spend', 'quote', 'movie', 'auspicious', 'night', 'sowing', 'seeds', 'next', 'year', 'harvest', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'Camelot', 'legend', 'acting', 'poor', 'story', 'script', 'are', 'simplistic', 'one', 'certainly', 'few', 'will', 'truly', 'identify', 'boorish', 'somewhat', 'lowlife', 'characters', 'movie', 'played', 'so', 'well', 'seemingly', 'analogous', 'actors', 'Mixed', 'flood', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'mixed', 'childlike', 'humor', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'child', 'should', 'see', 'most', 'adults', 'will', 'want', 'skip', 'talking', 'pig', 'other', 'such', 'absurd', 'nonsense']",N/A

I can hardly relate how excited I was to find what I thought was a sequal to Hallmark's Merlin.This movie is anything but that.  I could have forgiven the lack of plot connection to its predecessor, but my problems iwth it don't end there.  It was gloomy pretty much all the way through, with almost no special effects (and the few there were turned out to be quite disappointing).  The acting, too, was absolutely terrible.  I'm usually quite forgiving when it comes to acting -- one has to be if one's into fantasy movies these days -- but the acting in this film was absolutely rediculous.  Highschool actors could have done a better job!  Especially the guy who played the apprentice... his acting was so hokey I just wanted to slap him.Most importantly, however, this movie lacks the adventurous spirit and imagination of its predecessor (or of any fantasy film/miniseries that I would consider worth watching).  It just drags on and on and on, nothing new happens... I kept waiting for this to get good, but it never did.  Half is in the decrepit, dusty Camelot, and the other half puttering around in an ordinary, boring forest.  No enchanting underworld realm (as in Merlin), no magical creatures, nothing.  And the way the film is shot makes it very claustrophobic... along the lines of Excalibur (though THAT was a good movie).From reading other reviews here, I get the idea that many others feel similarly to me.  Moreover, after watching the special features, I get the impression that Sam Neil was dissapointed with the way this film turned out.  I wouldn't blame him.  I'd be embarassed just to be in this.

So I rented it hoping for as good of a movie as the first. It's not as good though. Merlin played by the under-rated Sam Neil thinks that everything is going well in Camelot and with King Artur. So he decides to take a nap and when he wakes up 50 years went by and he learns that there's no more Arthur. Which is a flaw in itself since he saw Arthur get killed for himself in the first movie. He didn't just leave him and go for a nap and wake-up to find out he wasn't alive anymore. So this movie pretty much acts like the first never happened.There's no mention of Mab although Miranda Richardson is back as the Lady in the Water but with her being bad this time and Merlin acting like they never met. Although it was her who gave him Excalibur in the first movie. There's also no mention of Numue who was Merlin's g/f in the first movie or of Martin Short's character Frik. Plus the movie just doesn't have as good of a cast as the first one. It's not even as magical as the first and the effects aren't as good either. So yes Sam Neil back as Merlin had a lot of potential but instead the script was more interested in his apprentice following his footsteps.I wish the script was more faithful to the original and eventhough it's not, I can't say I didn't watch the whole thing anyway. Or that I wasnt' entertained just a little. I wish it was as magical and well made as the first though but I guess it just didn't have the budget.

Unfortunetly this one has almost completely ignored the plot of the first movie. First off, at the end of Merlin, magic was finished because queen Maab and the Lady of the Lake were forgotten along with the old ways.

Having seen the first Merlin, and being a fan of Hallmark movies, I rented this DVD the first chance I got.  It was quite disappointing.  The storyline does not mesh with the original Merlin and the entire foundation of this movie conflicts with the original.  For instance, in this one Merlin wakes up in cave after a very long sleep alone, whereas the original leaves of with Merlin finding his love Nimue.  Also, this movie mentions that Arthur had found the Grail, when in the original, Galahad had found the Grail.  The castle at Camelot also looks quite different.Even taking aside the discrepancies in the storyline, this movie is not that good.  The music was lackluster and altogether forgettable.  Second, the romance scenes between Nimue and Merlin in the first movie were good, but were almost nonexistent here.  Third, the dialogue was quite cheesy; especially the part about saving Camelot in the end.  Fourth, the sword fight scenes looked all too choreographed.

It has absolutely nothing of the enchanted aura that was in the original ""Merlin"" (despite many attempts to make it so).Granted, the storyline happens many years after the facts involving Morgain, Arthur and Mordred, but still, although gloomy in scope, it could have been developed a tiny bit better.Indeed, nothing in this NON-sequel reminds us of what Camelot truly was for those who were involved with it (a few reminder flashbacks could have worked as well). Instead we are treated with a ""younger"" version of Merlin, who appears to be his very own son, with only a twist, he's also a thief and an adventurer...The rest is deja-vu, and self-gratifying drama, mixed with some hurried action scene here and there, just to keep audiences from falling asleep in the process.Some reviewers said that in its own right, this movie is as good as ""Merlin"". I must strongly disagree.If it only had been a sequel, I would have praised it, but in the present form, I cannot accept the cheers...Let's say we had a ""recall"" of Merlin from his ""long sleep"", because Camelot, or at least what was left of its glory, was about to be threatened by an adverse magician of equal powers if not stronger (just like in ""Lord of the Rings"" for instance), to those Merlin had, was about to destroy it and establish a new rule of terror on the Land, then and only then, would I have been interested in the plot.Let's go one step further. What if as a result of this titanic feat and probable duel, resulted the beginning of the Medieval history of England, with say, Nennius as the ideal successor to Merlin?Myth tied up with a touch of true history, would have helped things along and would have made this follow-up to ""Merlin"" even more believable, as well as closing the tale in a tightly knit loop between fact and fiction.This would have been the movie that would have awakened audiences and would have also brought home some prices and praises.This instead is only good to satisfy the very young and inexperienced audiences around, but not those who have either studied the tales, or are knowledgeable in the historic backgrounds surrounding the tales.Nevertheless, after having stated all this, it is still a very watchable movie with some tiny good moments for the entire family, but I repeat, it is not for the very demanding audiences.",3,"Not too bad for a ""Return"", but was it worth it...?",1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,2786,"['Sam', 'Neill', 'TV', 'movie', 'title', 'role', 'Merlin', 'Magician', 'only', 'thing', 'time', 'hence', 'three', 'stars', '.Not', 'even', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Lady', 'Lake', 'incarnated', 'Queen', 'Mab', 'disappeared', 'original', 'Merlin', 'can', 'find', 'true', 'joy', 'reprising', 'former', 'role', 'played', 'well', 'first', 'time', '.All', 'rest', 'cast', 'numbers', 'are', 'as', 'stiff', 'statuettes.The', 'story', 'original', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'enchanted', 'aura', 'was', 'original', 'Merlin', 'many', 'attempts', 'make', 'so', '.Granted', 'storyline', 'many', 'years', 'facts', 'involving', 'Morgain', 'Arthur', 'Mordred', 'still', 'gloomy', 'scope', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'tiny', 'bit', 'better.Indeed', 'nothing', 'NON-sequel', 'what', 'Camelot', 'truly', 'was', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'few', 'reminder', 'flashbacks', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'well', 'Instead', 'are', 'treated', 'younger', 'version', 'Merlin', 'who', 'be', 'very', 'own', 'son', 'only', 'twist', 'also', 'thief', 'adventurer', 'rest', 'deja-vu', 'self-gratifying', 'drama', 'mixed', 'hurried', 'action', 'scene', 'here', 'there', 'just', 'keep', 'audiences', 'falling', 'asleep', 'process.Some', 'reviewers', 'said', 'own', 'right', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'Merlin', 'must', 'strongly', 'disagree.If', 'only', 'had', 'been', 'sequel', 'would', 'have', 'praised', 'present', 'form', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'cheers', 'Let', 'say', 'had', 'recall', 'Merlin', 'long', 'sleep', 'Camelot', 'least', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'glory', 'was', 'be', 'threatened', 'adverse', 'magician', 'equal', 'powers', 'not', 'stronger', 'just', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'instance', 'Merlin', 'had', 'was', 'destroy', 'establish', 'new', 'rule', 'terror', 'Land', 'then', 'only', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interested', 'plot.Let', 'go', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'What', 'result', 'titanic', 'feat', 'probable', 'duel', 'resulted', 'beginning', 'Medieval', 'history', 'England', 'say', 'Nennius', 'ideal', 'successor', 'Merlin', 'Myth', 'tied', 'up', 'touch', 'true', 'history', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'follow-up', 'Merlin', 'even', 'more', 'believable', 'as', 'well', 'closing', 'tale', 'tightly', 'knit', 'loop', 'fact', 'fiction.This', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'awakened', 'audiences', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'brought', 'home', 'prices', 'praises.This', 'instead', 'only', 'good', 'satisfy', 'very', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'audiences', 'not', 'who', 'have', 'studied', 'tales', 'are', 'knowledgeable', 'historic', 'backgrounds', 'surrounding', 'tales.Nevertheless', 'having', 'stated', 'still', 'very', 'watchable', 'movie', 'tiny', 'good', 'moments', 'entire', 'family', 'repeat', 'not', 'very', 'demanding', 'audiences']",N/A

But first, what I LIKED about the film:1. Very nice scenery -- I really liked the locations and sets.2. The casting, as far as their appropriate appearance goes, is really excellent.3. The soundtrack is nice and subtle.Beyond that, this film had some problems:1. All the ""flashbacks"" (tons of those) were ""ad nauseum"". This also sort of blew the film's continuity.2. The acting skills of the cute little blonde were notably marginal, at least in this particular instance. I kept thinking that she must have been focused on trying to recall her lines -- she never seemed relaxed and natural.3. The battle scenes were really chopped up. You couldn't see any single  movement long enough to comfortably comprehend it, not pleasing to the eye and distracting as the dickens.4. This film would definitely be better in the widescreen version -- the full-screen version is way too much ""in your face"".In the end, this movie was okay but I probably won't watch it a second time. Since I bought it in a pawn shop (they had 3 copies, all full-screen) for three bucks, I didn't get hurt on it -- I'm sure I can think of someone in the neighborhood to pass it on to. I AM excited in anticipation to view the original ""Merlin"" movie, never having seen it yet. As I check out the ratings from both films, it seems that most folks are finding it a lot more palatable.

It benefited greatly from Sam Neill's gentle charm and good acting as well as having a colorful and engaging supporting cast. Unfortunately, Merlin's Apprentice pretty much introduced a new cast of characters and used so little of the two characters that were kept, Merlin and the lady of the lake, that this could hardly be considered a sequel.Putting aside the fact that this is really a production unrelated to its predecessor, there are other serious problems with the storyline. One is that the pacing is awkward. The story isn't told in a manner which engages the viewer. There is a relentless march of misery and hardship for the characters with little pay-off at the end. In fact, the ending is the equivalent of a reset button so the characters really don't do much except complain, fight, suffer, and die.Another part of the problem is that the outcome for some of the characters is too sudden and lacks explanation. I won't put a spoiler in this review, but I will say that one character seems to take a 180 degree turn at the 11th hour. Also, the lady of the lake was a positive character in the original miniseries and suddenly she has become a villain for no reason in this one. Would it have cost so much to explain why she started out benevolent, but turned evil? The fact that there was a ripe explanation available because of the ending of the original miniseries (revenge for her sister's demise) made it all the more of a waste not to provide some sort of motive for her change in direction.This isn't a total disaster, but it's also not very compelling.
