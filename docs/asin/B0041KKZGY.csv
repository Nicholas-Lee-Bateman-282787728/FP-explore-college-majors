The Sunset Limited is one of those pieces of theater that PBS used to run. It is a two character, one set play where the special effects come from  the actors themselvesOscar Winning Actor Tommy Lee Jones also puts on the director's cap for this production. He portrays a professor who tries to commit suicide on his birthday by stepping in front of the Sunset Limited train.He is saved by ex con on his way to work, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson is fulled with stories of life and truth. They both come back to Jackson one room apartmentCormac McCathy's play is something that does not need a large fanfare. It is an exercise is great acting. Jones and Jackson makes the play a human chess board of emotions. It also take the viewer with them. This play does not breal doen into class and what someone has. Ot does break down to what each man brings to the table.Jones downplays his character a lot, giving Jackson the upper hand to lead in this verbal duet. Jackson never upstages Jones. However Jones seem like Jackson's straight man. The one room makes this large character play more smaller and intimate. This is one of those plays where the viewer are voyagers looking inro the fourth wall.Many years ago, there was a film calledMy Dinner with Andre (The Criterion Collection). This films seem move like a racial version of this film. The action lies within the verbal action of the dialogIf I had my way, they both should win Emmy Gold. Jones for Direction.

Unfortunately, McCarthy's script missed the boat, badly! For all the pontificiating by both characters and dancing around the truth of God's Word, neither of them opened the bible and referred, at minimum, to John 3:16. And that stark absence left one with nothing but despair regarding salvation. It's for certain that one man cannot argue another man into God's kingdom and without the gospel, that is, Jesus Christ and Him crucified, it's totally impossible.",3,It missed the boat!,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,623,"['Just', 'watched', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'script', 'etc', 'really', 'one', 'think', 'God', 'destiny', 'person', 'when', 'he/she', 'Unfortunately', 'McCarthy', 'script', 'missed', 'boat', 'badly', 'pontificiating', 'characters', 'dancing', 'truth', 'God', 'Word', 'opened', 'bible', 'referred', 'minimum', 'John', '3:16', 'stark', 'absence', 'left', 'one', 'nothing', 'despair', 'regarding', 'salvation', 'certain', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'argue', 'man', 'God', 'kingdom', 'gospel', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Him', 'crucified', 'totally', 'impossible']",N/A
1381593,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0041KKZGY,C. B Collins Jr.,"[5, 5]","Having Samuel L Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones play the roles of Black and White, the two main characters in The Sunset Limited, is certainly bringing two outstanding talents together to provide this play with the best possible conditions for success. It is a bleak picture these two actors paint as they perform the minimalistic script of Cormac McCarthy. This play is very different from the novels of McCarthy for in the film dialogue is central whereas in his novels, dialogue is often extremely minimal whereas the plot is full of physical action and the writing is full of poetic descriptions of landscape. The play contrasts the faith of an ex-convict black man with the existential despair of a white college professor. The despair of the college professor however is not about personal conditions or circumstances but rather is complete despair around the condition of human life and human potential and human nature. The play is basically a dialogue between these two characters in a spare one room in a public housing project where the ex-convict lives. McCarthy is very poetic, even in dialogue that is philosophically charged. Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel Jackson make the dialogue come alive. After seeing the film, I suggest you reflect on who gets all the good lines. In my opinion, Black, the man of faith and human resiliency is naturally appealing and his language is extremely colorful. On the other hand, as a man who has just attempted suicide, White, is restrained and depressed. His world view is very dark, considering that he is not really committing suicide due to personal circumstances but due to the fact that humanity is so worthless and life for all humans is meaningless. Black tries to confront these concepts throughout the play. In the same way that McCarthy's novels are not for every reader, this play with its philosophical armature clearly visible may not be for every viewer. However it is stimulating to see two fine actors give outstanding performances of this script and pull out every bit of pathos from the philosophical dialogue.",4,Philosophy of life; meaning or meaningless,1302652800,"04 13, 2011",2011,2071,"['Having', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'play', 'roles', 'Black', 'White', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Sunset', 'Limited', 'certainly', 'bringing', 'two', 'outstanding', 'talents', 'together', 'provide', 'play', 'best', 'possible', 'conditions', 'success', 'bleak', 'picture', 'two', 'actors', 'paint', 'perform', 'minimalistic', 'script', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'play', 'very', 'different', 'novels', 'McCarthy', 'film', 'dialogue', 'central', 'whereas', 'novels', 'dialogue', 'often', 'extremely', 'minimal', 'plot', 'full', 'physical', 'action', 'writing', 'full', 'poetic', 'descriptions', 'landscape', 'play', 'faith', 'ex-convict', 'black', 'man', 'existential', 'despair', 'white', 'college', 'professor', 'despair', 'college', 'professor', 'however', 'not', 'personal', 'conditions', 'circumstances', 'rather', 'complete', 'despair', 'condition', 'human', 'life', 'human', 'potential', 'human', 'nature', 'play', 'basically', 'dialogue', 'two', 'characters', 'spare', 'one', 'room', 'public', 'housing', 'project', 'where', 'ex-convict', 'lives', 'McCarthy', 'very', 'poetic', 'even', 'dialogue', 'philosophically', 'charged', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'make', 'dialogue', 'come', 'alive', 'seeing', 'film', 'suggest', 'reflect', 'who', 'good', 'lines', 'opinion', 'Black', 'man', 'faith', 'human', 'resiliency', 'naturally', 'appealing', 'language', 'extremely', 'colorful', 'other', 'hand', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'White', 'restrained', 'depressed', 'world', 'view', 'very', 'dark', 'considering', 'not', 'really', 'committing', 'suicide', 'due', 'personal', 'circumstances', 'due', 'fact', 'humanity', 'so', 'worthless', 'life', 'humans', 'meaningless', 'Black', 'confront', 'concepts', 'play', 'same', 'way', 'McCarthy', 'novels', 'are', 'not', 'reader', 'play', 'philosophical', 'armature', 'clearly', 'visible', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'viewer', 'However', 'stimulating', 'see', 'two', 'fine', 'actors', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'script', 'pull', 'out', 'bit', 'pathos', 'philosophical', 'dialogue']",N/A

Black is convinced that White can be saved by embracing the hope of Jesus; White is convinced the world is empty and filled with shadows.McCarthy's play, riveting though it is, suffers that inevitable fate of all published plays: it is meant to be performed, not read.  The film gives the play that extra spark, elevating it to a true work of art.  Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson give their best performances in years; Jones is subtle and quiet, Jackson over-the-top and enthusiastic.  They chew through McCarthy's dialogue, adding the emotional flair necessary to convey the depth of these themes.  As a director, Jones knows how to frame a shot, how to linger, how to cut away.This isn't a film for everyone; surely you know that by now.  It has a cast of two, and is set entirely in a one-room apartment.  THE SUNSET LIMITED is a film with plenty of questions, and not one single answer.

I'm a minister, andI was so drawn in, so mesmerized by the dialogue and the intensity of Black and White. At first, I really thought that every person in the congregation I minister to should watch this film....... However, as I began to look further at reviews and what other's thought, I now think this film probably needs to be viewed with some caution. This could confuse some people and actually draw some folks into despair. Despair....... (WARNING:  MY POST FROM HERE FORWARD CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!)  that's ultimately the gospel White is preaching. There was a part of my soul that could identify and understand his points. I think most humans have felt those moments at times in their lives. But, there was one thing White said that really stood out to me. It was something I wish Black would have caught on to. He kept asking God for the words..... I have no idea, if this will be helpful to those of you who have posted on this, but this was my thought. White says, he wants the ""peace of darkness."" But, I don't believe there is ANY peace in darkness! Think about it, when you walk into a dark, unfamiliar room, the first thing you want to do is turn on a light! If not you may stub your toe, walk into a door, or worse someone or something could be lying in wait. Darkness does not provide peace! In truth, in provides more despair! So White was only going to go from despair to true despair! From darkness to eternal darkness. Of course this is my belief, and you are free to disagree with it. But I have definitely done my share of soul searching and in16 years of ministry have stared deep DARK DESPAIR in the face. And these words I tell you about darkness are not just what I think. But I believe it is the TRUTH. We live in a world that doesn't believe in truth much anymore. But I wholeheartedly believe in it. God Is Truth. God Is Love. And God is LIGHT. These were things I found comfort in at the end of this film. I have to believe in an existence that contains REAL truth. Quite honestly, I just can't understand how anyone can believe in anything else. But, obviously White did. And I'm sure to some, White made a lot of sense.

1381606,A1SAZB83QFR0W2,B0041KKZGY,"JackOfMostTrades ""Jack""","[7, 8]","The Sunset Limited is a brilliantly written two-character play (and two-character plays are very hard to create well).  I had given up on the idea of 'great' plays; maybe that's because they are written primarily by playwrights.  The Sunset Limited changed my mind. Who would have thought Blood Meridian author McCarthy could get so minimal in 'scope' but so 'haiku-ish' in writing.  Although maybe 'The Road' (the book, not the movie) is an indication. Here's a few simple reasons why I loved this work(based on the Jackson/Jones production).First the dialogue is perfect in terms of language, rhythm, and expression of 'voice.'  Second, the rhythms of the play are masterfully composed. Next, the play operates on an existential level (two 'real' men in a room) aesthetic, and meaning/theme/message. Finally, the characters are interesting and fascinating. All that together is not easy.Beckett was a master of the well-composed play and the exploration of meaning. He did it within a rarified world that eschewed 'naturalistic' dialogue. Checkhov got the 'naturalistic' part, the meaningful part, the characterization part. But often his characters are plain dull (although he may have intended it that way).  Albee is a bit weak in the meaning area (P. Roth said he is as profound as Guy de Maupassant).Ironically (or maybe not), The Sunset Limited seems a bit closer in genre to the teleplays that were produced in the so-called 'golden age' of TV.  Small cast, small environment, and hence limited physical action.  With the theatre as relevant a cultural force as blacksmiths are to transportation, it would be great if this work inspires another 'golden age.'  Well, I can dream, can't I?",5,Theatre can actually be great!

1381609,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0041KKZGY,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 7]","I am familiar with Cormac McCarthy only in passing. I'm aware that he's considered one of the world's greatest living writers, but I have personally read only one of his novels. Much of my familiarity comes from film adaptations of his work. In spite of this, I've come to associate his name with high quality. When I see his name on something, I get curious. There's something intriguing about a writer who reaches a point where other writers feel obligated to use different terms in describing him. Prose stylist may be my favorite. I only discovered The Sunset Limited a few days ago after catching a glimpse of the box art. Seeing McCarthy's name and the people involved, it rocketed to the top of my ""must-see"" list. Written by McCarthy himself, based on his second published play, the film is directed by Tommy Lee Jones, who co-stars with Samuel L. Jackson. They are the only two faces in the film. Both the play and the film are guided by two characters talking. This is not a new premise, but it's a risky one. Even with the most fascinating actors, this set-up can give way to tedium. Not only does The Sunset Limited have two fascinating actors face off with each other, but it's written by Cormac McCarthy. If ""prose stylist"" looks like little more than a pretentious euphemism for ""writer,"" it quickly becomes apparent that it's a more-than-deserved description.The Sunset Limited is a production of HBO Films, possibly the only company that can make a ""TV movie"" without the stigma normally attached to the term. Always risk-takers with a well-established threshold for high-quality productions, this film is more suited to this format than a traditional theatrical release. It's too much a creation of the stage to function properly as a theatrically released film, but provocative enough to warrant a film adaptation. It would be a hard sell certainly and airing on HBO exposes it to a broader audience than a limited theatrical release would have. The film premiered on HBO in February of 2011, but had somehow escaped me until just recently. I don't have HBO, but I'm generally up-to-date on these things. I'm not sure how large an audience this film reached but I hope those unaware of it are lucky enough to stumble on it. Even without a traditional theatrical release, rendering it void for most year-end list, this is one of the best films of 2011 and is too mesmerizing to remain overlooked. Again, I have read only one piece of McCarthy's literature. This leaves me with no doubt that he's truly one of the greatest living writers. To write something this profound, he'd have to be.In its 91-minute running time, there's never any doubt that it originated onstage. Comprised entirely of dialogue, with hardly a moment of silence; there's a lot to digest here. It's clear before the film is even halfway over that a second viewing will be necessary. The story takes place in real time, on one set, is essentially made up of one act, and has only two characters credited as ""White"" and ""Black."" Black refers to White as ""professor"" in the film, but for the sake of simplicity I'll use the credited names. Much of the dialogue is clear and blunt, but is presented in a roundabout way for the first few minutes. We soon gather that, earlier in the morning, Black saved White from attempting to throw himself in front of a train (the Sunset Limited of the title). The men now sit in Black's New York apartment and talk. Faith ultimately becomes the driving force of the conversation. The men are very different; White is well-educated, articulate, does not subscribe to religious beliefs, and is subdued in nature. Black has done time in prison, but is articulate and passionate; a strong believer in the Bible, he's more theatrically mannered. Their conversation bounces between different subjects but always leads back to faith and the Sunset Limited. Each man makes a compelling argument for their view on the existence of God but the film doesn't take either side. It's a serious minded work, but it's not humorless. Certainly Jackson's impersonation of a drunken woman will amuse even the most cynical viewer. Any attempt to describe the conversation in the film will seem too over-simplified. This is more than a two-sided persuasive essay on religious faith; it's too smart for that. Even if the subject matter goes right over your head, watching these actors converse and sink their teeth into the material is fascinating by itself.Jones, who has two previous directing credits, gives his film a unique tone that does two things simultaneously: it creates a specific mood unlike any film I can recall, while giving it away as a TV movie. What is it specifically? I cannot say, but I can't recall a film that feels the same as this one. With this and his previous directorial effort, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, it's clear he has an eye for filmmaking and a capability for applying that knowledge and ability to very different stories, while finding just what's needed to convey each one. With more output, he could evolve into an interesting filmmaker.The dialogue is top-notch, as it should be when it makes up the entire fabric of the piece. It's philosophically heavy, but never too dry or weighed down. It's some of the most poetic and profoundly earth-shaking dialogue I've heard in some time. At times, it's beautifully simplistic exchanges; ""Was he killed?"" ""I hope so. We buried him."" At other times, it's composed of beautifully fashioned declarations. Your point can only be as good as the words you choose to express it. Consider these pieces of dialogue: ""You become an accomplice to your own annihilation."" ""The dialectic of the homily always presupposes a ground of evil."" ""I don't regard my state of mind as some pessimistic view of the world. I regard it as the world itself. Evolution cannot avoid bringing intelligent life ultimately to an awareness of one thing and one thing above all else and that one thing is futility."" It's thought-provoking stuff that leaves you awe-struck of McCarthy's command over the language.Disregard any reservations you may have about a film with only one set and only two actors; there's never a dull moment. The dialogue keeps you riveted while the two phenomenal actors, giving career-best performances, keep you engaged. In a just world, Jackson would have secured more attention with is performance. He hasn't seemed more alive onscreen in years. The Sunset Limited seems to have been tragically overlooked thus far. This is a deeply astounding piece of art that the thinking moviegoer will not want to miss. It's a staggering, eye-opening film of unexpected and extraordinary power. There's enough to absorb here that it requires, demands, to be seen more than once.GRADE: A",5,"One Set, Two Actors; Never a Dull Moment",1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,6770,"['am', 'familiar',

1381614,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0041KKZGY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[61, 62]","""The Sunset Limited"" is a theater lover's dream!  This HBO production takes the brilliant Cormac McCarthy's existential treatise about life and faith and adapts it with precision to the small screen.  If, however, you are NOT a theater fan and are coming into this film blindly--I do think it's quite important that you know what you're getting into.  This is a two person dialogue--that's it!  For just under ninety minutes, two men sit in a shabby one room apartment and discuss the philosophical nature of man's reality.  With a heavy reliance on religion and man's obligation to one another, ""The Sunset Limited"" unfolds with a surprising urgency and even poetry.  It might not sound like thrilling entertainment but McCarthy's words filtered through the estimable talents of Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel Jackson make this a can't miss proposition for adult viewers.  It is for lovers of word and thought--and, indeed, it's not for everyone.  But it is a great way to get a prestigious theater piece to an audience that might not otherwise have the opportunity of enjoying it.So, for that, we've got to thank HBO (the undisputed leader in TV movie productions) and Tommy Lee Jones who also takes a producer and the directing credit for this intimate work.  Set in Jackson's apartment, ""The Sunset Limited"" unravels in real time in the aftermath of an incident at the local train station.  Jackson attempts to engage Jones in a discussion about what happened as well as keeping him safe from further harm.  A former convict, Jackson's real life stories are filled with harrowing details and his redemption provides ample evidence of a greater good.  Jones, an intellectual with a more pragmatic worldview, spars back with an elaborate cynicism.  In this contest of words, will Jones embrace the notion that perhaps life has more to offer if only he's willing to accept it?  Or will Jackson start to doubt his own convictions in view of his new friend's influence?I know my presentation of McCarthy's play might sound a bit dry--but make no mistake, ""The Sunset Limited"" is also filled with great warmth and unexpected humor.  Jones is stilted and disaffected, making the most of the more uptight role.  It is underplayed to perfection.  He all but gives the stage to the more showy Jackson.  This is, without a doubt, one of the meatier roles that Jackson has sunk his teeth into in recent years--and his relish is obvious.  He elicits the piece's biggest laughs and tells its most vivid stories--it is a riveting performance.  The devastating climax arrives courtesy of Jackson who just might have met his match with the intrepid and stubborn Jones.  A cerebral and intimate chamber piece, I reiterate that this film will not be embraced by everyone!  However, if the idea of seeing the work of one of our greatest writers performed by two acting powerhouses appeals to you--what's not to appreciate?

1381623,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B0041KKZGY,Thomas Glebe,"[9, 12]","A long time ago, in a world far far away, I saw this extremely simple film called ""My Dinner With Andre.""  That feature-length movie consisted of about 95 percent just two men talking, at a dinner table.  I recently saw this again on cable, at least a couple of decades since I had seen it last, and it was just as good as I had remembered it.  Maybe even better.  I was enchanted enough with it, then and today, that it came up repeatedly in an hours long discussion about ""everything"" (including films that we loved), I had with my brother (who had seen it) and my nephew (who had not) during the recent holidaze.  I even purchased and sent the DVD to my bro, since he, like me, hadn't seen it for so long, but had fond memories of it.I remember my brother and me trying to explain to my nephew how great the film was, because it was so simple, two people in a conversation, and yet it was so good BECAUSE it was so minimalist and basic.  I never really thought I would have seen such a similar and equally great film, until I caught the Sunset Limited, on HBO, and like ""Andre,"" this has become in short time, one of my favorite ""Hollywood/Studio"" produced films of all time.  It is nothing short of brilliant.  But a caveat that spoilers lay ahead...This work, about an hour and a half long, is all about two aging men, one black, one white (and they are labeled as such in the credits), simply talking, about many things, but mainly about belief and resulting hope, and knowledge and resulting suicidal depression.  There is little introduction to the proceedings except to make it clear that one day (night in fact), his ""birthday"" in point of fact, a white man (Tommy Lee Jones), decided to kill himself by jumping in front of a Harlem subway train, but was pulled from eternal death by another man, black (Samuel L. Jackson), although racial issues are only a side diversion here.  More to the essence, seems there was this highly educated but totally depressed and hopeless college professor who tried to end it all, but was ""saved"" in real life, at the last moment, by an ex-con, street-wise man roughly his own age, who was and is, unlike the man he saved, a Bible-believing ""christian.""  One who considered the suicidal man his brother, and saw as his divine duty that of somehow talking his new friend out of killing himself, if even temporarily.Now, while all of that might not make much sense at first, the genius of this film is that this whole concept is detailed and elaborated upon throughout in a constantly interesting manner, and it doesn't take that long to get things rolling.  Some movies grab you from the beginning, either greatly or even lukewarm, but most always seem these days to make some rather simple but powerful concepts, just unclear enough for awhile to leave the viewer hanging on, until the whole thing makes some sort of enjoyable or at least understandable sense.  Same here in a way, but not really.  Within less than ten minutes, you're either going to love this and look forward to every following scene and word, or not.  It is the former with this, for me at least.  I was hooked strongly early on, and I suspect most viewers will be or have already been as well.Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson turn in almost perfect performances.  Jones, who is the athiest/agnostic, and just simply tires of life and wishes for nothing more than eternal, peaceful nothingness and darkness and an escape from his lifelong pains, plays it all with subtle yet convincing and obvious depression.  Jackson, more world-wise, and more seemingly ""happy"" than the man he rescued from certain death, lives in his own kind of hell (his real environment and surroundings) and his transformation till the end into something a little bit different, is as convincing and compelling as is his denial of said fact from the start.There are so many philosophical, religious, and real-life ideas thrown about, almost in every single line of this play turned into a film, that I think I would do more harm than good in going into much more detail than I have already.  And I am limited by space and word count here anyway.  Needless to say, this is a simple film which makes the enlightened viewer, whether they agree more with the suicidal professor or the bible thumping savior, question many, many ideas, beliefs, and convictions, and the whole thing is detailed throughout with some very powerful background sounds, musical phrases, and atmospheric touches throughout, which only add to how really great this production is.I was raised a strict Catholic until the age of reason (in my case about age 12 or 13), identify much stronger with Jones' character and beliefs than that of Jackson's, and I've actually never really looked back despite my own similar periods of suicidal despair, doubts and reaching out for any glimmer of hope.  Although the beauty of this particular movie is that it gives almost equal and convincing respect to both belief systems (and everything in between), and ways of coping with (and/or ending) this difficult little thing called ""living.""The end is quite existential, even if one doesn't really understand what that means exactly.  And while coming to the finish, I was convinced it was all going to turn out one way or another, it didn't.  And only led to further thought and reflection, and repeated viewings.  If you can get into this, and I pity the fool who can't, this is a brilliant example of a simple parable about life and death, and all things relative to both, translated with tons of modern day sights and sounds, and I recommend everybody experience it at least once.  At the very least, this proves that it doesn't take big budgets or special production effects to produce for and convey to the potential viewer, something at the same time, very down to earth, and very ""divine.""",5,"Excellent, simple but superb cinema, from beginning to end...",1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,5849,"['long', 'time', 'ago', 'world', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'saw', 'extremely',

Mr. Samuel L Jackson and Mr.Tommy Lee Jones are great in this film. Mr. Samuel L Jackson good as always with his unique dialog. It's fast paced conversation with lessons to be learned. Most negative reviews of this movie are from moviegoers who need action or special effects to take them out of reality for a bit, this movie 'IS' reality and that's why it is so good.... Samuel L Jackson is the talker and Tommy Lee Jones answers and asks questions. Samuel L Jackson at his verbal best with fast moving dialog thru-out the film. If you have the world figured out then this film is NOT for you, all others should enjoy the dialog and all it's insights....

Kudos to HBO for bringing us this fabulous tale of life and death, walking by faith and not by sight, believer vs. atheist!  The dialogue between Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L.

If you are into philosophy you will enjoy this movie.  It was a little too dark for me with one character who I thought for sure would turn out to be absent of light while the other an angel.  That's all I will say about that one.

Just recently I saw the Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L Jackson version on television and have since acquired one of the limited DVD's that were released to industry insiders.What a masterpiece in dialogue this is.  The whole performance is set in the black man's Harlem apartment after having rescued the other from attempting suicide in the Harlem subway. Tommy Lee Jones's performance in particular is brilliant as the well educated but disillusioned white man that wants comfort in death while Samuel Jackson plays the born again ex con who tries desperately to change his mind. The non believing white man and the black man exchange their views about the value of their existence to an inevitable conclusion with the black pleading to God, ""Why didn't you give me the words""?",5,Well written and acted,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,1130,"['first', 'heard', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'Sunset', 'Limited', 'interview', 'Sydneys', 'Radio', 'National', 'two', 'actors', 'Mark', 'Kilmurry', 'White', 'Patrick', 'Williams', 'Black', 'performing', 'play', 'Sydneys', 'Ensemble', 'theatre', 'two', 'years', 'ago.During', 'interview', 'two', 'actors', 'performed', 'dialogue', 'was', 'so', 'intrigued', 'went', 'see', 'play', 'soon', 'Just', 'recently', 'saw', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'version', 'television', 'have', 'acquired', 'one', 'limited', 'DVD', 'were', 'released', 'industry', 'insiders.What', 'masterpiece', 'dialogue', 'whole', 'performance', 'set', 'black', 'man', 'Harlem', 'apartment', 'having', 'rescued', 'other', 'attempting', 'suicide', 'Harlem', 'subway', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'performance', 'particular', 'brilliant', 'well', 'educated', 'disillusioned', 'white', 'man', 'comfort', 'death', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'born', 'again', 'ex', 'con', 'who', 'desperately', 'change', 'mind', 'non', 'believing', 'white', 'man', 'black', 'man', 'exchange', 'views', 'value', 'existence', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'black', 'pleading', 'God', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'words']",N/A
