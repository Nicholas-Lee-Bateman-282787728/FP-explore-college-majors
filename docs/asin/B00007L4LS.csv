731114,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B00007L4LS,Amanda,"[9, 11]","I'm not quite sure where this film got its title, seeing as though I don't think it rained once throughout the whole thing. But who was noticing? 'Rain' is a powerful coming-of-age drama that centers around 13-year-old Janey. Janey seems to have a great relationship with her little brother, but her relationship with her parents is flawed. In the scenes where Janey catches a glimpse of her mother getting up-close and personal with the family photographer friend, Cady, she doesn't seem at all surprised. Her mother drinks most of the time, but isn't a mean drunk. She just downs a few at all the beach parties they throw at the house, and runs off into the bathroom to committ adultery with Cady, all while her husband looks on sadly. He doesn't look all that surprised, either. At the parties, Janey is just the drink-server, and usually gets a sip of alcohol from whatever Cady is drinking. Her mother sees this, but doesn't do too much about it. A lot of this film is like this. This family has the worst communication skills I think I have ever seen in a movie. And while all of this is going on with her mother and the photographer, Janey herself is coming to grips with her own sexuality - there is a local boy who obviously likes her, but she just toys with him by kissing him, then ignoring him. She doesn't like him, but she doesn't tell him that. Again with the bad comminication.This is beautiful film - literally. Filmed in New Zealand, the scenery is magnificent. Even if you didn't enjoy the story, you would certainly enjoy the view. The performances are all wonderful, especially Alicia Fulford-Wierzbicki, who plays Janey. She is a remarkable young actress who will go places. However, despite the fact that it's good, it is not at all a cheery film. After a while, you begin to sense that something bad will happen. You don't know when, and you don't know what, you just know that stories like this don't usually have happy endings. But that's why movies like this are better than your average blockbuster film. This is more like real life.",5,Where's the Rain?,1046390400,"02 28, 2003",2003,2061,"[""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'film', 'got', 'title', 'seeing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'rained', 'once', 'whole', 'thing', 'who', 'was', 'noticing', 'powerful', 'coming-of-age', 'drama', 'centers', '13-year-old', 'Janey', 'Janey', 'have', 'great', 'relationship', 'little', 'brother', 'relationship', 'parents', 'flawed', 'scenes', 'where', 'Janey', 'glimpse', 'mother', 'getting', 'up-close', 'personal', 'family', 'photographer', 'friend', 'Cady', ""n't"", 'seem', 'surprised', 'mother', 'drinks', 'most', 'time', ""n't"", 'mean', 'drunk', 'just', 'downs', 'few', 'beach', 'parties', 'throw', 'house', 'off', 'bathroom', 'committ', 'adultery', 'Cady', 'husband', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'look', 'surprised', 'parties', 'Janey', 'just', 'drink-server', 'usually', 'sip', 'alcohol', 'Cady', 'drinking', 'mother', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'much', 'lot', 'film', 'family', 'worst', 'communication', 'skills', 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'going', 'mother', 'photographer', 'Janey', 'coming', 'grips', 'own', 'sexuality', 'local', 'boy', 'who', 'obviously', 'just', 'kissing', 'then', 'ignoring', ""n't"", 'like', ""n't"", 'tell', 'that', 'Again', 'bad', 'comminication.This', 'beautiful', 'film', 'literally', 'Filmed', 'New', 'Zealand', 'scenery', 'magnificent', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'story', 'would', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'view', 'performances', 'are', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'Alicia', 'Fulford-Wierzbicki', 'who', 'Janey', 'remarkable', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'will', 'go', 'places', 'However', 'fact', 'good', 'not', 'cheery', 'film', 'while', 'begin', 'sense', 'something', 'bad', 'will', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'just', 'know', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'have', 'happy', 'endings', 'why', 'movies', 'are', 'better', 'average', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'more', 'real', 'life']",N/A

The film often looks grainy and distorted, which helps to evoke a mood of hazy memories of a childhood summer vacation.The storyline appears to borrow heavily from Satyajit Ray's 1955 classic Hindu cinema debut, Pather Panchali.  But it builds upon that base admirably with the added thematic dimensions of Janey's flowering feminine beauty and her family's unfulfilling bourgeois life, all framed beautifully with the marvelous cinematography and score.I have a hunch that in 5-10 years when all the glow comes off the other famous film trilogy from New Zealand, these three neglected feminine tales will all be viewed as superior films.

The wife in the story is in a unhappy marriage; despite her husband buying the family a nice home by the beach.  Much of her unhappiness is due to her alcohol abuse.  Seeking meaning in life, she develops a romance with a local boat dock worker.  The husband wants to be closer with his wife, but she has grown cold toward his affections.  He too abuses alcohol, though not as much as the wife.The film is interesting in how it shows the effects of alcohol's negative effects on the family- how it affects the husband and the two children.

Rain, in this batch, is it. I watched it, I digested it, I mulled it over, I compared it in my head endlessly to Kirsty Gunn's far superior novel, and when I was done with all that, I had squadoosh.It's not that Rain is a bad movie, really (though I'd thought, until the very end--where the movie uses a Big Reveal to show us the novel's opening scene--that the filmmakers had sufficiently deviated form the novel that I'd be able to really rip this apart), it just doesn't really distinguish itself in any way. It's a typical coming-of-age tale, centering around Janey (Alicia Fulford-Wierzbicki), a New Zealand girl who begins discovering her own sexuality at the same time her mother (Sarah Peirse) starts an affair with a handsome photographer (Marton Csokas, recently of AEon Flux) who lives on a nearby houseboat. Coming-of-age tales can be spun in any number of ways, from the erotic to the horribly embarrassing, but Jeffs and co. don't focus on any one long enough to allow it to grab hold. (Judging by the blurbs on the back, I'm pretty sure they were going for erotic; they succeed in a few places, one in particular standing out, but it's certainly nothing special in that regard.)The one thing that really stands out about the movie is Fulford-Wierzbicki, who does pretty well at playing a confused adolescent, and is drop-dead gorgeous besides; she's got a mighty career ahead of her with a bit of craft-honing.

From what I understand this is her debut film, but I fully expect to see her in more movies.  The acting in Rain is superb all around, but so much of the movie rests on Fulford-Wierzbicki's shoulders.  She creates a believable, complex character.Special note also goes to the young actor who portrays her brother.  There is a very real bond between the two characters, rarely are sibling relationships shown this realistically.The film is also very beautifully shot.  Many well-composed, strikingly-lit shots linger long enough to really appreciate them.  This is a very leisurely paced film, yet the characters are so compelling that it never becomes boring.
