I have never figured out the &#34;closed captions&#34; feature of my TV or VCR player.

This is not the case if the product listing is correct as the last episode with ""Foggy"" was in series 18 which aired in 1997.  The press release/Editorial Review describes Series 15 from 1993 which has already seen a release (Last of the Summer Wine: Vintage 1993).Series 19 from 1998 is the first full series (aka season) with Frank Thornton as ""Truly"".  There was no ""Christmas Special"" produced for the 1998 series.  This is one of the last series with Bill Owen as ""Compo"".  He would complete series 20 and 3 episodes in series 21 before passing.Here are the episodes from 1998 - series 19:S19/E1 - 4 January 1998 ""Beware of the Oglethorpe"": The trio meet a world-weary old school chum, and resolve not to go the same way.S19/E2 - 11 January 1998 ""Tarzan of the Towpath"": The trio attempt to relive an old childhood tradition of rolling down a hill instead of walking, but it wasn't as easy as they thought!S19/E3 - 18 January 1998 ""Truly and the Hole Truth"": Truly is determined to get his name in the paper as a local philanthropist, even if he has to con his way in!S19/E4 - 25 January 1998 ""Oh Howard, We Should Get One of Those"": Could Wesley's new invention help Compo get close to Nora Batty than ever before?S19/E5 - 1 February 1998 ""The Suit That Attracts Blondes"": Glenda gives one of Barry's suits away to a jumble sale, because she thinks it may cause him to be unfaithful- it soon falls into Compo's hands.S19/E6 - 8 February 1998 ""The Only Diesel Saxophone in Captivity"": Barry buys a saxophone from Auntie Wainwright, but Glenda won't let him play it indoors, so he has to find somewhere to practise.S19/E7 - 15 February 1998 ""Perfection - Thy Name is Ridley"": An elderly widower named Walter Ridley is moving back to the village after several years' absence. Compo and Howard are both tired of hearing the women praise his name, and when Compo learns that Nora is going to help clean his house, he is not pleased.S19/E8 - 22 February 1998 ""Nowhere Particular"": Howard buys a van, with plans to turn it into a love nest for himself and Marina, even buying some furniture for it. But nothing stays secret long when the trio get involved.S19/E9 - 1 March 1998 ""From Audrey Nash to the Widow Dilhooley"": Truly learns that his childhood sweetheart is returning to the village, and decides to recreate their youthful meetings.S19/E10 - 8 March 1998 ""Support Your Local Skydiver"": Compo is suspicious when Nora receives a postcard from Tenerife, as he is convinced she has an admirer. He takes up skydiving in yet another misguided attempt to impress her.This is a gentle program that's known for its positive portrayal of older people and family-friendly humour.

I first should correct my '97 listing review where I listed the '97 contents.  My apologies to you and my mistake was believing and cutting and pasting the then listed '97 contents from the BBC America site.  I actually cut and pasted the then BBC America listing of the '97 release contents when I posted that review, it turns out they later changed the contents and instead included ""Extra Extra"" as the special in the '97 release rather than the ""Here Comes The Groom"" special which the website then listed as part of it's contents.  So NOW it looks like, according to the BBC America website episode list of contents, ""Here Comes The Groom"" will be on this new '98 series DVD set rather than the '97 set.  I wish they could get it straight on what the contents are.  My apologies for quoting the source, who I thought knew best.I don't believe I need to extoll the virtues of this series again, it's one of the very best.  I only wish these releases by BBC America would make crystal clear exactly what the episode contents are, both on the package itself, when you get it in your hands and list correctly the episodes on their own website and here on Amazon too.  Here then is another quote from BBC America's website as to the contents of this new '98 season's release.  If this is wrong, blame BBC America, now to the quotation of the episode listing:There Goes the Groom - After drinking too much at a friend's stag do, Foggy passes out and is whisked off to Blackpool by the amorous village post-mistress. The last we hear is that she mistakenly believes he has proposed to her, and we never find out if he managed to wriggle out of it. We see Foggy slumped unconscious in this episode, but he has no dialogue. This episode also introduces the new third man, Herbert Trulove a.k.a. Truly.Beware of the Oglethorpe - The trio meet a world-weary old school chum, and resolve not to go the same way.Tarzan of the Towpath - The trio attempt to relive an old childhood tradition of rolling down a hill instead of walking, but it wasn't as easy as they thought!Truly and the Hole Truth - Truly is determined to get his name in the paper as a local philanthropist, even if he has to con his way in!Oh Howard, We Should Get One of Those - Could Wesley's new invention help Compo get close to Nora Batty than ever before?The Suit That Attracts Blondes - Glenda gives one of Barry's suits away to a jumble sale, because she thinks it may cause him to be unfaithful- it soon falls into Compo's hands.The Only Diesel Powered Saxophone in Captivity - Barry buys a saxophone from Auntie Wainwright, but Glenda won't let him play it indoors, so he has to find somewhere to practise.Perfection-Thy Name is Ridley - An elderly widower named Walter Ridley is moving back to the village after several years' absence. Compo and Howard are both tired of hearing the women praise his name, and when Compo learns that Nora is going to help clean his house, he is not pleased.Nowhere Particular - Howard buys a van, with plans to turn it into a love nest for himself and Marina, even buying some furniture for it.
