1121124,A1P2DHHCZ3K6JP,B000Z27H8Q,O. B. Tryggvason,"[0, 0]","The best season of ""Coach"" so far. Although this season has it's fair shair of major disappointments for Hayden Fox, the outcome is simply hilarious for us fans.What looks set to be the best season of football for the Minnesota Screaming Eagles will probably end up being the worst due to a cruel twist of fate. While dealing with all these upsets, Hayden breaks up with Christine, Luther has his heart broken once again by Marion and lots of other interesting things pop up.After two successful seasons the third one one really kicks into gear.""Coach"" has never been shy of downplaying the comedy in favor of some drama and this season has some very dramatic moments, especially when Hayden and Christine break up. It's a credit to Craig T. Nelson and Shelley Fabares how well they balance their comic performances with dramatic outbursts.But laughter is not far away and this season has some outstanding episodes. ""Magnificent Abscession"" is a personal favorite, that's the one where Hayden has some dental work done at the same time there's a major game going on and he let's Luther take charge. It's a total winner and there's a lot more of those on this season.On hand with great support is Jerry Van Dyke and Bill Fagerbakke as the unbeatable team of assistants Luther Van Dam and Dauber Dybinski. They can make almost anything seem funny and their input is a big part of why ""Coach"" was successful for nine seasons.Now I just wish Universal would get off their lazy behinds and release these seasons at a quicker pace.
