I do love Denise and will continue using her, but this DVD will be used for days when I just need a little stretch.The first 30 mins is mostly stretches.  She does offer different levels of progression but they are basic poses.  The poses arn't held for very long.  I didn't get much out of the lunge series.  Overall, a great stretch.The second 30 mins is taking traditional yoga poses and adding weights.  A bit more challenging, but not difficult if you practice yoga.Overall, a good basic yoga practice but not as challenging as I thought.

The second time you do the pose Denise makes it more challenging by having you stretch further.  You can take it to the next level or stay with the beginner pose.  I like that Denise gives you the option and has an exerciser showing modifications.  The second 30 min workout with light weights is a great way to strengthen and stretch at the same time.  It's mostly standing basic poses (warrior, triangle, crescent pose) while you do bicep curls and tricep extensions for the upper body.  At the end you'll hit the floor for bridge work, cobra and boat pose again holding weights to enhance the work.  I like how the workout ended with some leg, hip and neck stretches.

She does some warm up and basic poses such as child's pose, downward dog, low lunge, treading, eagle and dancer, for example.  For the second half she uses weights.

I was pleased to find that Hot Body Yoga is a completely different type of workout than Yoga Body Burn, but no less fun and challenging.The first 30-minute section of the dvd uses no weights but instead offers interesting new variations of traditional yoga moves at an engaging pace. This is perfect for light days when you want to do yoga but don't want anything that's strenuous on your joints, and yet you also don't want something so easy that it will make you sleepy.The second 30-min. section is more challenging. I use 3-lbs. hand weights but stronger users may certainly use 5 lbs. The moves throughout this segment challenge your entire body simultaneously: your upper body is maneuvering the weights, your lower body is holding and repeating yoga poses, while the core is stabilizing the entire action. As usual Denise gives you the most effective workout in the shortest time possible, while keeping it doable so that you stick with it. I find that workouts that are either too hard or too easy I can't bear to do again; Denise always finds the perfect balance.The set for this workout is very colorful and appealing. Denise has a group of men and women following her throughout this routine.I highly recommend this, as well as Yoga Body Burn and Body Makeover Mix from Denise.
