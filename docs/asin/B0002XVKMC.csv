849359,A374OO1EAUZASC,B0002XVKMC,2201,"[15, 20]","Season 7 of Buffy wasn't quite as good as season 5 (or 3) but it did make for a great end to the story.  This season's 'big bad' was introduced in the first episode (unlike most other seasons) but it is only in retrospect that you will understand it.After the poor reviews of the ""darkness"" of season 6 (more along the lines of a 20-something rut) the show's executives made the decision to make this season a bit more cheery.  Very few of the characters want to die, and getting through the day is no longer arduous.  It wasn't all candy canes and puppy dogs though, there was quite a bit of melancholy and the struggle to define yourself...a natural progression into adulthood that those of us about the same age as the characters will understand better than younger viewers.  Buffy learns to stand alone, without her safety nets, and realizes that she can do so...but she's prefer to have her friends around.Character development in season 7: Buffy basically grows up.  Instead of pouting and kvetching about her lousy lot in life, she decides to take a more active role in determining events around her, even when her friends & family disagree...and eventually decides she's had enough of being the one-and-only chosen one.  Willow begins the season basically curled up in the fetal position, afraid of what she'd become at the end of season 6.  By the end of the series, she's much more confident in her own power.  Xander and Anya both settle down quite a bit, reconcile themselves to their position in life (which is somewhat depressing, actually.)  Giles, like many parent-figures, has trouble letting go of his authority.  Dawn is growing up, making decisions and taking responsibility.  Spike is this season's anomaly, since he regained his soul at the end of season 6.  At first he's nearly insane, then suffers from a split personality, only to finally emerge at the end as a true champion of good.  Faith also made a return to Sunnydale, by which she finally found some peace & redemption within herself.  A lot of new characters were introduced, including Robin Wood who, while allied with Buffy, managed to make some waves and opened up the children-of-slayers plot line.  Caleb, the insane priest of evil, was one of the most interesting villans since Angelus of season 2, because he was just so wicked (and had a lot of fun in the process.)The worst part of the season were the potential slayers.  I realize that they had to be there in order to facilitate the end of the story, but good lord they were annoying.  Particularly Kennedy got on my nerves.  The character was bad, but the actress was worse, and a lot of Tara fans (myself included) were flabbergasted to think that Willow could go from one extreme to the other.  Granted, there's not a large Lesbian population on the show to choose from, but still... The other potentials were even worse, I'm just glad they didn't get too much screen time.  The best one was Chao-Ahn, because it was so funny to watch everyone misunderstand her.  Another low point was the Spike-Buffy relationship (or lack thereof,) I really wanted to see them knockin' the boots again.  But I suppose that was the point (love -vs- sex) and I can overlook that.All in all, I liked season 7.  I'd advise true fans of the series to purchase it.  My favorite episodes were ""Conversations with Dead People,"" ""Lies My Parents Told Me,"" ""Dirty Girls,"" and ""Chosen.""",4,Great final season for an excellent show,1095811200,"09 22, 2004",2004,3408,"['Season', '7', 'Buffy', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'season', '5', '3', 'did', 'make', 'great', 'end', 'story', 'season', ""'big"", 'bad', 'was', 'introduced', 'first', 'episode', 'most', 'other', 'seasons', 'only', 'retrospect', 'will', 'understand', 'it.After', 'poor', 'reviews', 'darkness', 'season', '6', 'more', 'lines', '20-something', 'rut', 'show', 'executives', 'made', 'decision', 'make', 'season', 'bit', 'more', 'cheery', 'Very', 'few', 'characters', 'want', 'die', 'getting', 'day', 'no', 'longer', 'arduous', 'was', ""n't"", 'all', 'candy', 'canes', 'puppy', 'dogs', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'melancholy', 'struggle', 'define', 'natural', 'progression', 'adulthood', 'same', 'age', 'characters', 'will', 'understand', 'better', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Buffy', 'stand', 'alone', 'safety', 'nets', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'prefer', 'have', 'friends', 'around.Character', 'development', 'season', '7', 'Buffy', 'basically', 'up', 'Instead', 'pouting', 'kvetching', 'lousy', 'lot', 'life', 'take', 'more', 'active', 'role', 'determining', 'events', 'even', 'when', 'friends', 'family', 'disagree', 'eventually', 'had', 'enough', 'being', 'one-and-only', 'chosen', 'one', 'Willow', 'season', 'basically', 'curled', 'up', 'fetal', 'position', 'afraid', 'what', ""'d"", 'become', 'end', 'season', '6', 'end', 'series', 'much', 'more', 'confident', 'own', 'power', 'Xander', 'Anya', 'settle', 'down', 'quite', 'bit', 'reconcile', 'position', 'life', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'actually', 'Giles', 'many', 'parent-figures', 'trouble', 'letting', 'go', 'authority', 'Dawn', 'growing', 'up', 'making', 'decisions', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'Spike', 'season', 'anomaly', 'regained', 'soul', 'end', 'season', '6', 'first', 'nearly', 'insane', 'then', 'split', 'personality', 'only', 'finally', 'emerge', 'end', 'true', 'champion', 'good', 'Faith', 'also', 'made', 'return', 'Sunnydale', 'finally', 'found', 'peace', 'redemption', 'lot', 'new', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'including', 'Robin', 'Wood', 'who', 'allied', 'Buffy', 'managed', 'make', 'waves', 'opened', 'up', 'children-of-slayers', 'plot', 'line', 'Caleb', 'insane', 'priest', 'evil', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'villans', 'Angelus', 'season', '2', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'wicked', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'process', 'worst', 'part', 'season', 'were', 'potential', 'slayers', 'realize', 'had', 'be', 'there', 'order', 'facilitate', 'end', 'story', 'good', 'lord', 'were', 'annoying', 'Particularly', 'Kennedy', 'got', 'nerves', 'character', 'was', 'bad', 'actress', 'was', 'worse', 'lot', 'Tara', 'fans', 'included', 'were', 'flabbergasted', 'think', 'Willow', 'could', 'go', 'one', 'extreme', 'other', 'Granted', 'not', 'large', 'Lesbian', 'population', 'show', 'choose', 'still', 'other', 'potentials', 'were', 'even', 'worse', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'best', 'one', 'was', 'Chao-Ahn', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'watch', 'everyone', 'misunderstand', 'low', 'point', 'was', 'Spike-Buffy', 'relationship', 'lack', 'thereof', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'knockin', 'boots', 'again', 'suppose', 'was', 'point', 'love', '-vs-', 'sex', 'can', 'overlook', 'that.All', 'liked', 'season', '7', ""'d"", 'advise', 'true', 'fans', 'series', 'purchase', 'My', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'were', 'Conversations', 'Dead', 'People', 'Lies', 'My', 'Parents', 'Told', 'Me', 'Dirty', 'Girls', 'Chosen']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season
849360,AAKXNDAN3PHES,B0002XVKMC,A. Benoit,"[10, 12]","One of the original appeals of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series--aside from the fantasy and girl power--was the quick wit of the dialogue amongst the characters. While it's always hard to place that dialogue in real life, you can accept the witty reparte when your main character is a supernaturally powered teenage girl who fights vampires and other evil monsters.However, about halfway through season 7 (at about the same point that the gaggle of potential slayers start to show up), the show loses the wit and humor that made it great. Too many speeches from Buffy made her less lovable and harder to empathize with. Instead she seemed arrogant and was rightfully thought holier than thou by everyone who was supposed to be on her side. Also Spike's resouling seems like a broken record when we've already lived through Angel's torment in previous seasons. Yet another vampire with a soul to serve as the First Evil's plaything.Good Things About Season 7:-Dawn's character development. After being a whiny brat for the majority of  her previous two seasons, Dawn has finally matured leaps and bounds over what anyone could've expected of her.-Conversations With Dead People. Probably the best episode of the entire season. It could prove disappointing for the action lovers, but the scenes with Willow alone made my skin crawl. Also Jonathan Woodward is golden as a vampire that Buffy ends up having a nice chat with.-The first half of the season has some great episodes including the very humorous Him, the excellent Anya-centric Selfless, and the very creepy Same Time, Same Place. Other enjoyable episodes include The Killer In Me and Storyteller.-Nathan Fillion as the evil preacher, Caleb, is superb.Bad Things About Season 7:-When Giles finally returns to Sunnydale, he's a cardboard cut-out of the character we used to know and love. With the exception of a few good lines here and there, Giles is cold, detached, and hardly the father-figure Buffy has always held so dear.-Buffy's speechifying got rather tiresome and repetitive.-The Potential Slayers were pretty useless for a majority of the season and it got to a point when I kind of wished the Bringers would kill them all.-Regardless of whether or not I'm a Willow/Tara fan or not, Kennedy was not the kind of woman for Willow to move on with. While The Killer In Me was a shining moment for Alyson Hannigan, her scenes with Kennedy were almost painful as Iyari and Aly had nowhere near the kind of chemistry that Aly had with both Amber Benson and Seth Green in the character's past romantic relationships.Obviously this is a must have for die-hard fans of Buffy, but compared the rest of the series, season 7 is truly lacking.Favorite Feature of the DVD Set: Great Outtakes.

849361,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B0002XVKMC,A. Burchfield,"[5, 7]","I'm going to miss Buffy, now that it's gone. Seven years (6&1/2 actually)of great fight scenes, generally good writing and characters, lots of good plotlines, just plain better than most anything else out there.I found the start of the seventh season confusing,(the killings of the young potentials), but that made sense later on. Never did really understand Spike's madness or why he was in Sunnydale High's basement, but I liked the way so many past evil types made cameos as the big evil ""The First"" appeared to him, great casting in those people.Perhaps my least favorite episode was #16 ""Storyteller"" in which Andrew goes around making a video record of the gangs work for the future, even here in this episode there were good moments, how many series have good moments even in bad episodes?, Buffy was one of them.I actually thought they managed a pretty good variety of storylines through the season. Anya dropping her demon role,most of the Willow line,even a lot of the potential's story bits were good.It always surprised me how the writers could keep coming up with some of the lines and scenes that they did. I think it was in #20 ""Touched"" in which Buffy meets the old priestess(?) in some crypt- I think that's where she got the scythe- tells the woman her name and the lady obviously doesn't take her seriously. I also liked the way the woman said something like ""let's just say I look good for my age"". Later she tells Angel (Boreanaz was pretty much wasted here as a way of giving James Marsters a way into going on ""Angel"")that Reverend Caleb ""had to split"", she'd cut him in half with the scythe. In #22 ""Chosen"", on being told that the mall was destroyed Dawn says, ""I knew I fought for the wrong side"". That episode had a lot of other strange lines/ scenes such as the one where some of the gang, the night before the final battle,look like they're planning the battle but it's some silly board game. The day of the battle in the school where Willow and the others discuss shopping afterwards is also typical of the odd but good writing this show had (look closely in the background of one of the darkened hallways and you'll see someone movinig in the background who shouldn't be there).I never really had a problem with the introductions of the potentials during the course of the season (one of them actually was in a few episodes before she was revealed to be one), or the way some of them were killed in the course of events. An ancient super type of Vampire killed one of the potentials and almost beat Buffy to death, she inspires the others by killing him, that was one of Ms. Gellar's best scenes that season.The final battle in the Hellmouth made everyone look good, one of the best battles of the season.The introduction of the new principal, Mr. Wood, was generally well done- and I especially liked the part about how he was the son of Nikki, the Slayer Spike killed in New York back in the '70's.Much more good than bad in this one, I'm going to miss it.",4,I'm going to miss it,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,2989,"[""'m"", 'going', 'miss', 'Buffy', 'now', 'gone', 'Seven', 'years', '6', '1/2', 'actually', 'great', 'fight', 'scenes', 'generally', 'good', 'writing', 'characters', 'lots', 'good', 'plotlines', 'just', 'plain', 'better', 'most', 'anything', 'else', 'there.I', 'found', 'start', 'seventh', 'season', 'confusing', 'killings', 'young', 'potentials', 'made', 'sense', 'later', 'Never', 'did', 'really', 'understand', 'Spike', 'madness', 'why', 'was', 'Sunnydale', 'High', 'basement', 'liked', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'past', 'evil', 'types', 'made', 'cameos', 'big', 'evil', 'First', 'appeared', 'great', 'casting', 'people.Perhaps', 'least', 'favorite', 'episode', 'was', '16', 'Storyteller', 'Andrew', 'around', 'making', 'video', 'record', 'gangs', 'work', 'future', 'even', 'here', 'episode', 'were', 'good', 'moments', 'how', 'many', 'series', 'have', 'good', 'moments', 'even', 'bad', 'episodes', 'Buffy', 'was', 'one', 'them.I', 'actually', 'thought', 'managed', 'pretty', 'good', 'variety', 'storylines', 'season', 'Anya', 'dropping', 'demon', 'role', 'most', 'Willow', 'line', 'even', 'lot', 'potential', 'story', 'bits', 'were', 'good.It', 'always', 'surprised', 'how', 'writers', 'could', 'keep', 'coming', 'up', 'lines', 'scenes', 'did', 'think', 'was', '20', 'Touched', 'Buffy', 'old', 'priestess', 'crypt-', 'think', 'where', 'got', 'scythe-', 'woman', 'name', 'lady', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'woman', 'said', 'something', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'look', 'good', 'age', 'Later', 'Angel', 'Boreanaz', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'wasted', 'here', 'way', 'giving', 'James', 'Marsters', 'way', 'going', 'Angel', 'Reverend', 'Caleb', 'had', 'split', ""'d"", 'cut', 'half', 'scythe', '22', 'Chosen', 'being', 'told', 'mall', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Dawn', 'knew', 'fought', 'wrong', 'side', 'episode', 'had', 'lot', 'other', 'strange', 'lines/', 'scenes', 'such', 'one', 'where', 'gang', 'night', 'final', 'battle', 'look', ""'re"", 'planning', 'battle', 'silly', 'board', 'game', 'day', 'battle', 'school', 'where', 'Willow', 'others', 'discuss', 'shopping', 'afterwards', 'also', 'typical', 'odd', 'good', 'writing', 'show', 'had', 'look', 'closely', 'background', 'one', 'darkened', 'hallways', ""'ll"", 'see', 'someone', 'movinig', 'background', 'who', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'there', '.I', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'problem', 'introductions', 'potentials', 'course', 'season', 'one', 'actually', 'was', 'few', 'episodes', 'was', 'revealed', 'be', 'one', 'way', 'were', 'killed', 'course', 'events', 'ancient', 'super', 'type', 'Vampire', 'killed', 'one', 'potentials', 'almost', 'beat', 'Buffy', 'death', 'others', 'killing', 'was', 'one', 'Ms.', 'Gellar', 'best', 'scenes', 'season.The', 'final', 'battle', 'Hellmouth', 'made', 'everyone', 'look', 'good', 'one', 'best', 'battles', 'season.The', 'introduction', 'new', 'principal', 'Mr.', 'Wood', 'was', 'generally', 'well', 'done-', 'especially', 'liked', 'part', 'how', 'was', 'son', 'Nikki', 'Slayer', 'Spike', 'killed', 'New', 'York', 'back', ""'70's.Much"", 'more', 'good', 'bad', 'one', ""'m"", 'going', 'miss']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season
849362,A1AXHNRDJEQ0B,B0002XVKMC,Adi Adler,"[3, 7]","On one hand - Buffy was always one of the best shows out there. Not only was it well made TV, but also had some very positive messages. On the other hand - I found season 7 to be the weakest season yet. I'm sad to say that as much as I loved BtVS - after watching season 7 I understood why it was time for it to get off the air.So what didn't I like about this season?Let's start with the 'Big Bad': the First Evil (to which we were introduced in season 3). Even though it had the potential to become the scariest baddie of them all (an evil that resides in all of us, and it can hurt us because it knows our psychological weaknesses & can use them against us) - it just wasn't scary. Yes, we've heard that Buffy & the gang were constantly afraid that this one can't be beaten. Yes, we've heard that students in the New & Improved Sunnydale High are fighting more than ever. Yes, we've seen people leave Sunnydale because they're scared because even they could feel the evil in the air (which is a biggie considering this is Sunnydale, where evil is constantly there). But seeing the potential evil with our own eyes? Only in very few episodes (such as 'Conversations with Dead People'). The evil is mostly talked about.Also added this season were the Potentials - the girls who are potential slayers that may be activated one day. On one hand - I liked the idea of seeing 'The Next Generation', reminding us of the basic charm of discovering the slaying world, where every random vampire was a challange. On the other hand - there were so many of them that it was hard to tell mosto of them apart from each other. Standing out were Rona, and Kennedy - which eventually because Willow's new girlfriend.Another problem was Spike. The character he had played was good, no doubt, and was exactly what Buffy needed at this point in her life. And even with a soul, he had managed to become as far removed as he could from Angel. The problem was that this isn't the Spike we've rown to know & love!! Spike was always his own man, who took care of his own interests without and regard or remorse about loyalty & friends. Having him give up his life willingly to save everyone else is completely out of character. Also - if he was such an evil vampire, he seems to be feeling very guilty about raping Buffy, but not moved by the people he killed?Buffy, which is usually the best written character in the show - was also weak at some points of this season. Let's begin with her blind & unwavering trust of Spike. As bpth Spike & Angel had demonstrated before - having a soul doesn't make a vampire good or unaffected by the First. Even the cip hadn't helped control Spike when the First possesed him. So why does Buffy trust him so blindly, when she refuses to give Anya the same benefit of the doubt?Even though the 'mutiny' of the potentials was supposed to enhance our sympathy for Buffy - I felt more sympathetic towards the rest of the gang...And as for the ending - why the assumption that Buffy can now become a 'regular' person? Through the series' 7 year run, it tried to show that Buffy can have a try at a regular life even though she was the slayer. The slayer Nikkie Wood even managed to have a baby! The last minute or so of he series somehow denies all that.The estra features (though very few) were mostly good.",5,So hard to rate...,1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,3318,"['one', 'hand', 'Buffy', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'best', 'out', 'there', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'well', 'made', 'TV', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'positive', 'messages', 'other', 'hand', 'found', 'season', '7', 'be', 'weakest', 'season', 'yet', ""'m"", 'sad', 'say', 'as', 'much', 'loved', 'BtVS', 'watching', 'season', '7', 'understood', 'why', 'was', 'time', 'get', 'off', 'air.So', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'season', 'Let', 'start', ""'Big"", 'Bad', 'First', 'Evil', 'were', 'introduced', 'season', '3', 'Even', 'had', 'potential', 'become', 'scariest', 'baddie', 'evil', 'can', 'hurt', 'psychological', 'weaknesses', 'can', 'use', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'Yes', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Buffy', 'gang', 'were', 'constantly', 'afraid', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beaten', 'Yes', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'students', 'New', 'Improved', 'Sunnydale', 'High', 'are', 'fighting', 'more', 'ever', 'Yes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'people', 'leave', 'Sunnydale', ""'re"", 'scared', 'even', 'could', 'feel', 'evil', 'air', 'biggie', 'considering', 'Sunnydale', 'where', 'evil', 'constantly', 'seeing', 'potential', 'evil', 'own', 'eyes', 'Only', 'very', 'few', 'episodes', 'such', ""'Conversations"", 'Dead', 'People', 'evil', 'mostly', 'talked', 'about.Also', 'added', 'season', 'were', 'Potentials', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'potential', 'slayers', 'may', 'be', 'activated', 'one', 'day', 'one', 'hand', 'liked', 'idea', 'seeing', ""'The"", 'Next', 'Generation', 'reminding', 'basic', 'charm', 'discovering', 'slaying', 'world', 'where', 'random', 'vampire', 'was', 'challange', 'other', 'hand', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'was', 'hard', 'tell', 'mosto', 'apart', 'other', 'Standing', 'out', 'were', 'Rona', 'Kennedy', 'eventually', 'Willow', 'new', 'girlfriend.Another', 'problem', 'was', 'Spike', 'character', 'had', 'played', 'was', 'good', 'doubt', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'Buffy', 'needed', 'point', 'life', 'even', 'soul', 'had', 'managed', 'become', 'far', 'removed', 'could', 'Angel', 'problem', 'was', ""n't"", 'Spike', ""'ve"", 'rown', 'know', 'love', 'Spike', 'was', 'always', 'own', 'man', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'own', 'interests', 'regard', 'remorse', 'loyalty', 'friends', 'Having', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'willingly', 'save', 'everyone', 'else', 'completely', 'character', 'Also', 'was', 'such', 'evil', 'vampire', 'be', 'feeling', 'very', 'guilty', 'raping', 'Buffy', 'not', 'moved', 'people', 'killed', 'Buffy', 'usually', 'best', 'written', 'character', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'weak', 'points', 'season', 'Let', 'begin', 'blind', 'unwavering', 'trust', 'Spike', 'bpth', 'Spike', 'Angel', 'had', 'demonstrated', 'having', 'soul', ""n't"", 'make', 'vampire', 'good', 'unaffected', 'First', 'Even', 'cip', 'had', ""n't"", 'helped', 'control', 'Spike', 'when', 'First', 'possesed', 'So', 'why', 'Buffy', 'trust', 'so', 'blindly', 'when', 'give', 'Anya', 'same', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'Even', ""'mutiny"", 'potentials', 'was', 'supposed', 'enhance', 'sympathy', 'Buffy', 'felt', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'rest', 'gang', 'ending', 'why', 'assumption', 'Buffy', 'can', 'now', 'become', ""'regular"", 'person', 'series', '7', 'year', 'run', 'tried', 'show', 'Buffy', 'can', 'have', 'try', 'regular', 'life', 'even', 'was', 'slayer', 'slayer', 'Nikkie', 'Wood', 'even', 'managed', 'have', 'baby', 'last', 'minute', 'so', 'series', 'somehow', 'that.The', 'estra', 'features', 'very', 'few', 'were', 'mostly', 'good']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

849366,A18FIOWY2YVSAU,B0002XVKMC,Amazon Customer,"[3, 6]","I missed a couple when broadcast, (was busy...)and now watching these back to back without a week or sometimes several in between, I've gotta say that like S6, I'm much more into them the 2nd time around. Since I know where it's going and all of the major twists, I'm just appreciating the execution and not stressing on where I would have wanted the story, characters to go. Just enjoying the ride. Basically my take is it's the jazz version of Buffy. They have changed up the rythyms, and the structure that we have been accustomed to. Whether 1 likes it or not, it IS something a bit different. So far I'm liking it. And it is VERY unpredictable IMHO. And several eps. are downright eerie. Except for ""Hush"", Buffy never really gave me the Willies (save for a well placed jolt here and there) but some of these eps. like ""conversations"" are genuinely freaky. The fact that everyone is a bit different character-wise adds to this. 7 seasons of the same characters acting the exact same can get kinda dull. Like David Lynch got his hands on a Buffy treatment. And there is actually a sense of danger. Like ALL of the Scoobies can get their asses handed to them and even die. The fact that the First can mess with your head so much and you never know if a character is REAL or not is a bit unnerving IMHO. Spike is pretty menacing in these first few, like he can actually do some damage again. The scene where he grabs Anya's arm while she's going through his clothes is great, but then plays out TOTALLY differently than you'd think. Now I do seem to recall by the last 2 eps. it's kinda back to normal, saddle up, face off, Faith back but SMG in charge again... and that's all good, like the end of S5, But for the 1st 1/2, I'm into the fact that it's out there. I know there's a dull, talky patch ahead prior to the last few, but with these actors now as good as they are, SMG simply a marvel to behold and Marsters doing exemplary work, I think I can handle it. And I have missed a few, so there will be a few surprises in store..... I personally find the ""dark, broody"" Buffy eps. far more interesting than the peppy, goofy all is good by the end types that dominated S1 and part of S2.... Now, I'm not saying it's the best, (either S3 or S5 is IMHO... S2 I've always felt was a bit overrated...) but it's certainly the weirdest and in many ways perhaps the most intruiging Season.So, let the arrows fly, I know I'm in the minority.But if one can watch these like I'm doing back to back, it might be better or more interesting than the way we were forced to by the broadcast year. Certainly was revelatory to me...All this is of course, just my opinion....D",4,"""Jazz"" version of Buffy....",1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,2662,"['missed', 'couple', 'when', 'broadcast', 'was', 'busy', 'now', 'watching', 'back', 'back', 'week', 'sometimes', 'several', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'S6', ""'m"", 'much', 'more', '2nd', 'time', 'around', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'major', 'twists', ""'m"", 'just', 'appreciating', 'execution', 'not', 'stressing', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'story', 'characters', 'go', 'Just', 'enjoying', 'ride', 'Basically', 'take', 'jazz', 'version', 'Buffy', 'have', 'changed', 'up', 'rythyms', 'structure', 'have', 'been', 'accustomed', 'Whether', '1', 'not', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'far', ""'m"", 'liking', 'VERY', 'unpredictable', 'IMHO', 'several', 'eps', 'are', 'downright', 'eerie', 'Hush', 'Buffy', 'never', 'really', 'gave', 'Willies', 'save', 'well', 'placed', 'jolt', 'here', 'there', 'eps', 'conversations', 'are', 'genuinely', 'freaky', 'fact', 'everyone', 'bit', 'different', 'character-wise', '7', 'seasons', 'same', 'characters', 'acting', 'exact', 'same', 'can', 'get', 'kinda', 'dull', 'David', 'Lynch', 'got', 'hands', 'Buffy', 'treatment', 'actually', 'sense', 'danger', 'Scoobies', 'can', 'get', 'asses', 'handed', 'even', 'die', 'fact', 'First', 'can', 'mess', 'head', 'so', 'much', 'never', 'know', 'character', 'REAL', 'not', 'bit', 'unnerving', 'IMHO', 'Spike', 'pretty', 'menacing', 'first', 'few', 'can', 'actually', 'do', 'damage', 'again', 'scene', 'where', 'Anya', 'arm', 'going', 'clothes', 'great', 'then', 'out', 'TOTALLY', 'differently', ""'d"", 'think', 'Now', 'do', 'seem', 'recall', 'last', '2', 'eps', 'kinda', 'back', 'normal', 'saddle', 'up', 'face', 'off', 'Faith', 'back', 'SMG', 'charge', 'again', 'good', 'end', 'S5', '1st', '1/2', ""'m"", 'fact', 'out', 'there', 'know', 'dull', 'talky', 'patch', 'ahead', 'prior', 'last', 'few', 'actors', 'now', 'as', 'good', 'are', 'SMG', 'simply', 'marvel', 'behold', 'Marsters', 'doing', 'exemplary', 'work', 'think', 'can', 'handle', 'have', 'missed', 'few', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'few', 'surprises', 'store', '..', 'personally', 'find', 'dark', 'broody', 'Buffy', 'eps', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'peppy', 'goofy', 'good', 'end', 'dominated', 'S1', 'part', 'S2', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'best', 'S3', 'S5', 'IMHO', 'S2', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'bit', 'overrated', 'certainly', 'weirdest', 'many', 'ways', 'perhaps', 'most', 'intruiging', 'Season.So', 'let', 'arrows', 'fly', 'know', ""'m"", 'minority.But', 'one', 'can', 'watch', ""'m"", 'doing', 'back', 'back', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'more', 'interesting', 'way', 'were', 'forced', 'broadcast', 'year', 'Certainly', 'was', 'revelatory', 'course', 'just', 'opinion', '.D']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

849368,A928WN8NV03WZ,B0002XVKMC,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[17, 26]","This wasn't the best season by far of Buffy, but it was a lot better than many other shows of a similar genre.  In the final season they did a lot to try to take you back to the beginning.It tried to incorporate a lot of previous characters from the show.  Going as far as bringing back Angel, which is impressive since his show is on a different channel.  They return to the newly constructed Sunnydale High. Buffy returns to Sunnydale, only now as a counselor hired by the principal.  Dawn is attending her first day of school in Sunnydale High much like Buffy.  She also meets two friends through meetings with the undead.  They were intended to be Dawns sidekicks if there was to be a spinoff show starring her character.The Big Bad this season was from a season three episode ""Amends"". It is known as the first, claims that it was the first evil consciousness ever.  It is able to take the form of anyone that has died, and has many minions.  The most visible are the Bringers, a group of cultists that worship the first and all have no eyes.  It attempted to torment Angel into turning back into Angelus out of hopelessness and vanishes after it fails.This season has a feeling of desperation right from the beginning.  You see people running from strange robed figures and being killed with wicked looking knives throughout the early part of the season with no explanation.  The gang is being attacked from the start and seeing the dead speaking to them as the first.  The Scoobies themselves are in chaos;  No one really trusts Willow when she returns.  Xander is still dealing with the loss of Anya, and focusing on work, and still falling in love with demons.  Spike is dealing with his newfound soul, and being tormented by the First.  Anya is settling back in as a vengeance demon.All in all this was a decent season, not as good as some of previous seasons, but not the worse.  They had a lot of good stand alone episodes and some good story arcs.  As well as getting into some other ideas they never really explored early in the series.  The main one being the potential slayers, the first slayer, and the only slayer to have a child.Season Highlights includeLessons:  The gang is back at the newly constructed Sunnydale High, Buffy as a counselor, and Xander as the head of construction.  But strange things are going on, someone was causing the dead to rise, and a group is chasing down young girls all over the world and killing them.Beneath You:  Anya is back to her old tricks and Buffy finds out that Spike now has a soul.Same Time Same Place:  Willow returns from England to return to the gang, but is nervous.  No one seems to see her, and people are ending up dead and skinned.Help: Buffy has her first day as a counselor where she encounters a young girl who claims to see her death in the near future.  Buffy makes every effort to find out how and save this girl.Selfless:  Anya's character is finally explored after she causes the grisly death of an entire frat house due to a vengeance contract.  You get to see her history with Olaf the troll and some of her famous periods of time as a vengeance demon.Him:  Hilarious episode; a boy seems to have a strange hold on any who see him.  They will obsess about him and do anything possible to win his favor, sometimes with dangerous results.  First Dawn falls under his spell, then other members of the gang do with disastrous results.Conversations with Dead People:  Several stories are going on at once in this episode.  Buffy encounters a former classmate turned vampire that does psychoanalysis on her when they recognize each other.  Willow is talks with Cassie who says she is back from the dead with a message from Tara.  Dawn has a strange encounter with a poltergeist.  The remnants of the nerd trio, Jonathon and Andrew, return from Mexico, and seem to know something is going on.Never Leave Me:  Spike has been brainwashed somehow, and the gang has him tied up at the house.  They capture Andrew and hold him at the house to answer some questions.  But the Bringers attack and make off with Spike in the melee, for use in a dangerous ritual over the hell mouth.Bring on the Night:  Buffy tries to return to where she originally encountered the first, and finds a scary vampire called a Turok-Han, a vampire that vampires fear and is nearly killed.  Giles arrives at Sunnydale as the last survivor of the Watcher Council with some of the potential slayers.Showtime:  More potentials arrive at the house in Sunnydale.  A girl that seems to be a potential turns out to be the First, and it gives a cryptic warning.  Buffy shows that the Turok-Han can be harmed for the potentials.First Date:  Buffy finds that principal Wood was the son of a slayer.  Andrew decides to join the slayers.Get It Done:  Wood gives Buffy a bag of some of his mother's belongings.  They have some items that pull Buffy to meet the Aboriginals that created the first slayer, and they offer her power for a price.Storyteller:  Andrew decides to keep a documentary to show future generations, or to keep a record in case they fail.  Outbreaks are occurring all over, and apparently Andrew is responsible due to his actions at the Hell mouth.  They think that his blood is needed and he has to face his actions.  Funny episode.Lies My Parents Told Me:  The gang is looking for the trigger to Spikes brainwashing.  They have to go into his history and really explore him as a character.Dirty Girls:  The first unveils his new weapon, the insanely powerful Caleb.  The gang faces its first taste of defeat at the hands of its enemy, Xander is badly wounded. Faith returns to SunnydaleTouched:  The gang decides that Buffy is irrational, and places Faith in charge.  Buffy decides to attack Caleb directly and finds that he has uncovered a powerful weapon.  Faith and the gang stumble into a trap laid for them by the First.Chosen:  The final battle, you'll have to see it.",4,Decent finale for Buffy,1095379200,"09 17, 2004",2004,5926,"['was', ""n't"",

849369,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0002XVKMC,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[6, 12]","""I'm sorry, I missed that last part on account of her neck snapping and all.  Did she say the end is near or here?""  This line, said by the mysoginistic Caleb (Firefly's Nathan Filion) in the second to last episode, not only applied to the events in the series, but to the series itself.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer's seventh season was its last, and while there would be one more season of its spin-off Angel, there was no doubt that the end of the Buffyverse was nearing.This show had a rare and important luxury; the writers and producers knew going into the season that this would be the last (a luxury not shared by Angel or Firefly, unfortunately).  So this season was kind of a big ""Thank You"" to the fans, a sort of ""Best Of"", according to Joss Whedon in one of the commentaries (I think it was for the episode Lessons).  Here's the plot: three months after Xander (Nicholas Brendon) saved the world from Dark Willow (Alyson Hannigan), things have gotten a little better in Sunnydale, but not by much and not for long.  Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Xander, and Dawn (Michelle Trachetenberg) are the only remaining Scoobies in Sunnydale.  Willow and Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) are in England, where Willow is getting treatment, Anya (Emma Caufield), while still being in Sunnydale, is once again a vengeance demon, and Spike (James Marsters) is nowhere to be found, although, after his attempted rape of Buffy last year, Buffy, Xander, and Dawn aren't in a hurry to find him.  Buffy has been training Dawn to fight while Xander is now a big-shot in the construction world.  We soon learn that he recently completed a project that sends chills down the spines of our heroes.  Sunnydale High has been rebuilt on the exact same grounds it stood on before.  Only now, the principal's office is situated right above the Hellmouth.  If that wasn't forboding enough, the new principal, Robin Wood (D.B. Woodside), is very shifty, and on Dawn's first day of school, she is attacked by some strange spirits.  While Buffy searches for her in the school basement, she discovers the now ensoulled Spike living in the basement and completely insane.  Turns out, Spike has been seeing things ever since he got back.  In one of the series' most powerful scenes, we see Warren (Adam Busch), Glory (Claire Kramer), Adam (George Hertzberg), Mayor Wilkins (Harry Groener), Drusilla (Juliet Landau), The Master (Mark Metcalf), and Buffy taunting Spike.  Keep in mind that six of those people are not only dead, they are former big bads from each of the various years.  Elsewhere around the world, strange men in black cloaks are killing innocent girls for no apparent reason.  Back in Sunnydale, one chaotic night, Willow is visited by the ghost of girl claiming she has a message from Tara (Amber Benson) while Dawn sees a vision of her mother, Joyce (Kristine Sutherland).  Meanwhile, Jonathon (Danny Strong) and Andrew (Tom Lenk) return from Mexico, seemingly to try to help Buffy.  Although, it turns out that Andrew has been seeing the ghost of Warren, and, on the ghost's orders, he stabs Jonathon over a very bizzare seal in the high school's basement.  All the while, the gang is haunted by the message, ""From beneath you, it devours"" (or ""It eats you, starting with your bottom"", based on the translation).It turns out that The First Evil, or The First for short, is responsible for these hauntings and killings.  For those of you who have seen the show before, you know that, in Season 3, The First was introduced and tried to get Angel (David Boreanaz) to either kill Buffy or kill himself.  The girls are potential slayers, or girls who could be ""called"" if the current slayer dies (although they always say that someone would be called if Buffy were to die, when she died the second time, no one new was called, so I've come to the conclusion that Faith (Eliza Dushku) would have to die in order for someone new to be called).  The First also has one of its agents detonate a bomb inside the Watcher's Council.  Soon, Giles returns to Sunnydale with a few potential slayers, claiming that more will be coming.  After being defeated by an ancient and very powerful vampire, which comes to be called the Ubervamp, Buffy decides that she's tired of waiting for the bad guys to come to her, and she begins training the potentials as an army to take on The First, the Bringers (the priests of The First), and the Ubervamp.The First Evil is exactly what its name states; it is the original evil thought.  It is sin, it is hatred, it is malice.  While it doesn't have a physical body (and therefore cannot physically hurt anyone directly), it can be channeled, and it can appear in the form of anyone who has ever passed away.  Furthermore, it is omnicient (all-knowing), and can therefore be very persuasive, whether it is lying or telling the truth.If Season 6 was the (relatively) worst year, then this one was definitely the most polarizing.  Personally, I thought that this season was very good (though not as good as 3, 5, or 2), and I know many people who agree.  However, there are just as many people who thought that this year was poor, unfocused, and had a lousy villain.  I myself really liked The First.  Yeah, some people are put off, because, how do you fight the concept of evil?  But I think the writers handled things very well, and even though we know that there will always be evil (and therefore, The First is pretty much unkillable), they still found a way for Buffy and the gang to deal it a serious blow.I will admit that they could have done a little more with it, but I'm sure that many of the ideas that I have were thought of by the writers as well.  Sadly, due to contract problems and time constraints, not everyone they wanted could show up.  For example, in Conversations With Dead People, the crew wanted Amber Benson to play The First impersonating Tara, but she didn't want her last performance on the show to be as a bad guy.  Furthermore, many people would have liked to see Xander and Willow's friend Jesse (Eric Balfour) from the first season make an appearance (I know I would have liked to have seen it).One of my favorite things about this season was Andrew.  He is probably one of the funniest characters in the show's history!  The episode Storyteller was made because they were thinking of doing another spin-off, and they wanted to see if fans would be interested in a show about Andrew (I know I would have watched it).  On the subject of spin-offs and great characters, I was so happy to see Faith back in the mix, and I STILL can't believe she chose to do Tru Calling over a spin-off about Faith.  Another character who I thought was a good addition (I didn't ""like"" the character, but he was interesting to watch, and it was appropriate for him to be in the season about female empowerment) was Caleb, the ex-preacher.  He had, um, interesting dialogue (I'll never figure out how they got away with those lines about the white wine at the last supper), and he was a formidable foe for Buffy.On the subject of the potentials, I liked the idea a lot more than a lot of fans did.  I didn't like all of them (I hated Kennedy (Iyari Limon), but not cause she was Tara's replacement, but because she was a bad character).  Although they did take time away from some of the principle characters.  I was fine with Dawn losing screen time, but, while Xander didn't get as shafted as some people complain, he did get pushed into the background a bit, which was a little sad.Ok, so nothing's perfect; there were a few things I didn't like about this season.  The big one was the mutiny near the end.  Yeah, I could see why most of the people were a little upset with Buffy, but I felt they went a little far.  I thought that Buffy cut Spike a little too much slack, and the fact that she turned on Giles and Wood in favor of Spike (sort of) never felt right to me.  And while I liked the whole female empowerment aspect, sometimes I felt they got a little too anti-male.  Oh well, what're you gonna do?Another polarizing aspect of the season is the series finale Chosen.  While a lot of people like it, others claimed that it was a bit of a letdown, and that The Gift would have made a better ending.  I disagree. The Gift was an amazing episode, don't get me wrong, and while I don't like one of the episodes over the other (they are each good for different reasons), I feel that Chosen was the more appropriate ending.  I forget whether Joss said this, if I merely came to this conclusion myself, or some combination (I'm guessing its the last one), but I've always believed that while writing The Gift, Joss knew he wanted Buffy to die, but it wouldn't be the end because he had at least two more seasons to do; ""the next one"" and ""the last one"".  This gets a little confusing, but, had he wanted to, he could have done more than two, it just worked out that way.  But he needed to do the ""next season"", where Buffy came back and was bored with life, and he needed to do the ""last season"" with the First Evil.  If he had the energy, he could have done any number of seasons in between, it just worked out so that he got these last two seasons.  Anyway, going back to Chosen, I thought it nicely wrapped things up.  It was everything a series finale should be; exciting, a little sad, it mirrored some of the earlier episodes, funny, hopeful, tied up loose ends, and yet it left us wanting more.Finally, this set has some of the best special features on any of the Buffy sets (although the panel discussion on Season 6 was pretty awesome).  The season overview (which was also a bit of a series overview) was probably the best of all the overviews, and they finally got an interview with Alyson Hannigan (sadly, SMG still didn't take the time to put in her two cents).  The Final Sundown was an interview with Joss Whedon about his Top 10 episodes, the outtakes were hilarious (pretty much anything Tom Lenk did was awesome), and there is a hidden feature that allows you to see the ""Previously..."" montage from the episode The Gift (which basically is clips from the entire first five seasons).Overall, this is a great season, but as I've said before, in my opinion, none of the seasons are bad, some are just better than others though.  If I were to rank them, it would probably go 3, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 6.  This is a fitting end to a great series.  Some episodes I reccomend are Lessons, Help, Selfless, Him, Conversations With Dead People (probably one of the scariest episodes), Never Leave Me, Bring On The Night, Showtime, Potential, Get It Done, Storyteller, Lies My Parents Told Me, Dirty Girls, Touched, End of Days, Chosen.  Enjoy the end of the Buffyverse, and hope that sometime in the future, we get to return.",5,"Final Season, First Evil, Forever Slayer",1100908800,"11 20, 2004",2004,10756,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'missed',

Seasons 1-4 were the best of the show, then when season 5 came I was so let down by how ridiculously stupid Glory and the whole concept was that I just stopped watching. Season 6 was a lot better than it's predecessor but it was still lacking. The ""villians"" were completely unrealistic in that Buffy has faced evils that are 20 times as bad in less time. But season 7 went to the show's roots. Well, as far as it could go. Sure, it didn't have that ""new-monster-every-episode"" style, but it had that interesting ""what-the-hell-is-going-to-happen"" mentality leaking from it that kept me watching. I loved this season and the way information leaked, the way things were brought, and the preparation for the war with the first (although I believe the devil was the first evil).There were some things that got me wondering if Joss made blatant errors, or there was more to the story than what was said. Like in the first episode of the season, the first is going through all the villians of past seasons when speaking to Spike and changes to Druscilla. Isn't Dru still alive? Or is the fact that she is ""undead"" passible as ""dead""?Anyways, not much was left unquestioned, but this season was definitely a great one and ""must have"" for me to own.

849372,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B0002XVKMC,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[7, 8]","Season seven of BTVS was a fitting ending to, at least in my opinion, the finest show on television.  The 'big bad' was a perfect final foe, the season's arc was fantastic, and the final battle was awesome.  And Tom Lenk was a brilliant addition to the cast.  Not to mention the very final shot of the series was a perfect one to go out on.The only major qualm I have with this season is that the cast was so large it unfortunately didn't allow for many of the intimate moments between the main characters that were so prevalent during the first six years.  I would've liked to have seen a lot more about:  Xander and Anya's relationship and where it was going. More with Dawn learning to fight and becoming a sort of pseudo-slayer.  And more with Willow and her ability to cope with using magic again, how she was dealing with the loss of Tara, and her getting into a new relationship with one of the potentials.  And of course, more about Buffy and her relationship with Spike, and then again with Angel when he shows up towards the end of the season.  The only other thing that bothered me was the absence of a stand alone episode or two, something along the lines of 'Once Again With Feeling'.  It seemed as if just about every season had one of these episodes, but number seven didn't.Though it sounds as if I'm complaining, the season was great.  The show was great.  Its too bad it couldn't have gone a few more years.  But hopefully one day there will be another series set in the Buffy universe now that 'Angel' has also unfortunately been canceled as well.A great show and fitting ending.",5,A Fitting End To Television's Finest Show,1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,1598,"['Season', 'seven', 'BTVS', 'was', 'fitting', 'ending', 'least', 'opinion', 'finest', 'show', 'television', ""'big"", 'bad', 'was', 'perfect', 'final', 'foe', 'season', 'arc', 'was', 'fantastic', 'final', 'battle', 'was', 'awesome', 'Tom', 'Lenk', 'was', 'brilliant', 'addition', 'cast', 'Not', 'mention', 'very', 'final', 'shot', 'series', 'was', 'perfect', 'one', 'go', 'out', 'on.The', 'only', 'major', 'qualm', 'have', 'season', 'cast', 'was', 'so', 'large', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'many', 'intimate', 'moments', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'prevalent', 'first', 'six', 'years', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'more', 'Xander', 'Anya', 'relationship', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'More', 'Dawn', 'learning', 'fight', 'becoming', 'sort', 'pseudo-slayer', 'more', 'Willow', 'ability', 'cope', 'using', 'magic', 'again', 'how', 'was', 'dealing', 'loss', 'Tara', 'getting', 'new', 'relationship', 'one', 'potentials', 'course', 'more', 'Buffy', 'relationship', 'Spike', 'then', 'again', 'Angel', 'when', 'up', 'towards', 'end', 'season', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'absence', 'stand', 'alone', 'episode', 'two', 'something', 'lines', ""'Once"", 'Again', 'Feeling', 'seemed', 'just', 'season', 'had', 'one', 'episodes', 'number', 'seven', ""'m"", 'complaining', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'gone', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'hopefully', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'be', 'series', 'set', 'Buffy', 'universe', 'now', ""'Angel"", 'also', 'unfortunately', 'been', 'canceled', 'well.A', 'great', 'show', 'fitting', 'ending']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season
849373,A12YBME6FWNV0Q,B0002XVKMC,Awesome!!!,"[2, 6]","Ill get to season seven. First off Buffy is the best show of this decade so far (cause seasons 4 and 5 fell in 2000 and 2001). And I think it was the best show of the nineties and its nice to see alot of tv critics acknowledge this on the dvd extras. So thoughts on the final season? Somehow it made me like season six a little more which i didnt think possible, but repeated viewings always make seasons go over a little better. I started having issues with believabilty of character motivations on Buffy way back in season three when Giles drugged Buffy. I just didnt buy that. Didnt like it. But Ive come to deal with the drastic shifts in character behavior on the show so they dont bother me anymore. But there were plenty of problems with this season. While the potentials were important to keep the storyline going did we need so dang many? Too much time with them though they serve their purpose in the last episode. Too many storylines too, though i liked the one with Principal Wood and I thought it was going to play out longer than it did. Too many characters seemed to be wrapped up too quickly like Dawn and especially Willow. And Kennedy? What the heck? She wasnt needed for Willow to deal with her issues. There could have been more time for more important characters without Kennedy. The Big Bad had good and bad points but mostly i felt the ""character"" was too vague and not threatening enough but Caleb was good. Also Giles was CRIMINALLY, CRIMINALLY underused. At least season six had the excuse of him being off in England. Giles was always one of my top three favorites characters on the show. Watching all the features and listening to Joss Whedon do the commentary for ""Chosen"" made me a little less hard on season seven cause, hey, im sentimental, but even he aluded to the what i suspected and that is that the show was supposed to have ended with season five. I still feel it should have. Season five was incredibly good and maybe the second best season tied with season three. But that wasnt how things worked out and we got two more troubled seasons and I think part of that is because Whedon was less involved in the show. Watching ""Chosen"", the last episode ever, showed how much Whedon was missing from the series. It literally was like watching another tv series, it was so funny and well written. There was so little humor in this last season. Too many characters, too much plot, too much seriousness. Maybe thats the problem. The episodes were too heavy. His musical episode in season six even felt out of place. I guess it doesnt do any good to pretend seasons six and seven don't exist. It was good to have some folks back like Faith, though she was much more awesome on Angel. I wish Harmony coulda come back once more cause she was so darn funny. But there will always be ""wants"". I have to say that Ive never appreciated Sarah Michelle Gellar on the show as much as i did this season. As I look back she was never my favorite character but she really has sold the whole thing from the beginning and she did a brillant job making the whole series work. Im going to miss this show and looking foward to seeing what happens next. They left the end open and its up to everyone;s imaginations to continue the show. Ill always have the episodes on dvd to go to again to feel happy or sad or intense...its that good a show. Even though it started in the late nineties it went until 2003 so i can honestly say that this is the best show of this decade.Top 10 favorite Buffy episodes with seasons noted in ( ):No order..1. ""The Body"" (5)- Definitely the best directed episode of the series, and the most goose bumpy. Very moving, very sad without any cliches.2. ""When She Was Bad"" (2)- This was the first episode of the second season and right away the character conflicts and drama of the series were really brought up a notch. i really liked the dramatic tension in this episode. It cleared the way for the rest of the series to have really great drama in the midst of the horror stuff.3. ""Passion"" (2)- I think cause the series kinda showed with this episode that it wasnt afraid to kill off main characters so you knew the risk was always there. Plus its always awesome to see Giles in full bad-ass mode.4. ""The Zeppo"" (3)- Xander's finest hour. Great concept for an episode. Really funny.5. ""Buffy vs. Dracula"" (5)- Again Xander gets the best lines. Why aint that fool been on one of the boxes yet?! Okay he finally is.6. ""Dopplegangland"" (3)- favorite willow episode. she gets to play more of her evil doppleganger to hilarious effect. This is possibly the funniest episode of Buffy.7. ""The Prom"" (3)- Chosen only for the last five minutes..very touching scene with her and angel and ""wild horses"" on the soundtrack..sigh.8. ""The Freshman"" (4)- This one cause i thought Sunday was an awesome villian and joss gave her some hilarious lines. he shouldnt have killed her off so quick.9. ""Fool For Love"" (5)- I think just about the ultimate Spike episode. really well directed. he has some good lines here, but doesnt he always? Spike rules.10. ""The Gift"" (5) - Fitting that this is last on my list since originally this was supposed to be the last episode ever of buffy. Its an amazing finish: it brings all the storylines of the season together brilliantly and the ending is so moving it gives me goosebumps galore.What a show. The series gets five stars.

Joss Whedon is a god, and he delivers more goods for the seventh and final season of a show that has given nothing but top of the line product for 7 seasons. Coming off the controversial sixth season, season 7 went back to basics and felt more like it's old self. ""Lessons"" is a classic and wonderful premiere, showing that Sunnydale High has been re-built, and Dawn now attends the new buildind. Spike has gotten his sould back and is a blabbering idiot in the basement. Willow is is England with Giles recovering from ""Dark Willow"", and Buffy gets a job offer as the new school councelor. Plus, it has a very welcome return for some old familiar foes in a brillaint scene. ""Same Time, Same Palce"" has Willow finally coming home, but with results no one expected. The main big bad here is The First. The first evil that has no real shape itself, except for the forms of dead people it takes to manipulate our heroes. Aiding The first is the vampire The Turok-Han, or UberVamp. And finally, evil comes in the form of evil southern preacher Caleb, played by Nathan Fillion. Potentials from all over the world are being brought in to Sunnydale to train and fight the biggest evil once and for all. There are numerous highlights here. The return and welcome addition of Andrew to the Scooby Gang being one. ""Conversations With Dead People"" is a brilliant episode and one of the highlights of the season. ""Storyteller"" lets Andrew shine in a fun and entertaining way. ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" is a strong flashback episode dealing with Spike and his mother, and with the present day story of Principal Wood's own agenda towards Spike for his own mother reasons. The great Faith returns in one of the season's top highlights, ""Dirty Girls"", and remains for the last 4 episodes after that. There is good to be had with ""Selfless"" and ""Him"" as well. Season 7 isn't without it's flaws. It slows and gets real bogged down in the middle and late in the run with too many episode relying on dialogue and the training of the potentials. Still, there is enough goodness here to make up for it. The season is back to 'Girl Power', and the sentiment is driven home. The season really goes back to beginning and takes the show to a logical place that can only be the end. There was nowhere else to go. Once again, the writing is superb and the cast proves, one final time, that they were one of the best and most underrated ensembles on TV. The Emmy's should be ashamed. Sarah Michelle Geller carried this show with grace, elegance, heartbreak, strength, and humor. One of the finest leading performances on TV for the last seven years. The finale, ""Chosen"", is a rip snortin' conclusion with heartbreak, hope, and a feeling of new and wonderful beginnings. The final scene, while not splashy, speaks volumes in just that one frame. It is a beautiful and logistical swan song for our favorite heroine and her team of friends and fammily, and for a groundbreaking show that can never be, or ever will be, topped. It's an interesting and final journey, and I thank Joss and the cast and crew for giving this special little world of theirs to us every week.

I thought it moved slowly, and that there was a lot of unnessecary repetition as far as establishing what The First is, slayer mythology, etc.HOWEVER, I gave this season on DVD a 5 star rating because of the content. The commentaries are great, and I love that they included wrap footage as well as a tribute to Buffy fans.

During 7 Spike, Anya, Andrew and most important of all Buffy get much better treatment and chances to show all their sides. Kennedy was a waste of space, but the less said about her the better. Caleb also was rather dull as a henchman to The First. SMG was brilliant when playing the ultimate evil, The First in its Buffy incarnation. As much as I am a huge Spike fan, he sometimes shows limitations in his ability to convey subtle things with his appearance, but he delivers his lines perfectly. Xander's character was largely played out by this point, but he is played perfectly. I think Dawn often gets a bad rap. Michelle T. did the best that can be done with the character, but the idea that she would turn on her sister in favor of a bunch of strangers frankly was not believable. As many others have noted in the past, it's hard to understand how important Giles was to moving story lines along until he was gone. I don't think its an accident that his presence improved Season 7. Robin Wood's character was explained efficiently and believably thanks to a single conversation with Giles.But did the ending satisfy....sort of ...Season 7 ended the series in a reasonable way, but fans can hope the talk of made for TV movies following Spike and some of the other Angel characters will open the door for a return by some of our favorites from Buffy. Especially Andrew, the Inspector Clouseau of the Slayer Sidekicks.

For me it probably had a lot to do with very high expectations following the two previous amazing seasons.  I will say that 7 is still superior to 1 and 4.I agree with what a lot of the reviewers are citing as this seasons weaknesses. The potentials were unlikable and stole valuable time away from the characters that we had grown to love.  Kennedy was especially lame and ruined Willow's final season for me.  The 'Big Bad' wasn't.  And even Faith, so visceral and thrilling in season 3, was oddly unaffecting. But most surprising was the cold-heartedness of the scoobies. Xander's flippant ""thats my girl"" comment following Anya's death.  Willow's ability to get over Tara with such a deadbeat as Kennedy.  Giles' overall grumpiness.  And how could Dawn turn her back on her own sister during the mutiny?  Maybe all that killing over the previous six seasons hardened their hearts.I also found it a little sad to have so many newcomers getting so much face time in what should have been a season devoted to the main characters who had endured so much together.  I also feel the final episode should have been a 2 hour show.  This amazing series earned that right and it seems like JW just didn't have the necessary time needed to do right by his core characters.But as always, sub-par Buffy is still better than most anything ever produced on television.

I mean, what else can you say about a show about a girl named Buffy who kills vampires?And yet, this show was so much more than that. This is a show that didn't dumb itself down to make ratings. This is a show that made ratings by simply being good.I watched Season 7 on DVD with a heavy heart. Having already been spoiled by well-meaning friends, I knew what was to come. That beloved characters would die, that the show would be over, that I would have nothing new in the Buffyverse to watch.I sat down with my DVDs and my box of tissues. I sobbed, I ranted, I laughed. And I fell in love all over again.We watched the characters grow and mature. They stumble along the way, but when they regain their footing, they are somehow stronger for it. And they do it without losing their memory of where they came from.Putting aside the analogies of demons and monsters and ultimate evil, this is a show about growing up in the 90's.

It sucks as a TV show.Every previous season of Buffy is based around a core group of characters (Buffy, Giles, Xander, Willow and depending on the season you're watching Cordelia, Oz, Anya, Dawn, etc). There are several story arcs taking place with each character, and although they fight evil, in between fighting evil there are other stories happening. And of course there is also the campy humor which was quite enjoyable throughout the first six seasons (although the sixth season slacked a bit).But come the 7th season, and the show is now nothing but lousy serial pulp fiction involving humourless characters who have no lives outside the main storyline.

Now, don't get me wrong 4-6th seasons were great. I would give them 5 stars as well it's just that the show was different, angel was gone, oz leaves, buffys done with high school, giles is out of a job, and etc.  Now i understand they need to change the show. You cant have the same thing over and over again, but it just didnt seem quite as classic as buffys first 3 seasons.  One thing that really let me down was that after forth season they changed the stunt doubles and stunt coreographer and the fight scenes werent as cool anymore. Anyway, while seasons 4-6 had amazingly shocking and heartfelt moments and great episodes i just didnt quite feel they matched the finesse of seasons one through 3. Buffys seventh season seems to be much more in the direction of seasons 1-3.  The storeis were riveting and the arch was intense.  Buffy ended with a bang and it was a great seaon to go out in.  while i love every seaon of buffy every season also has a few minor low points, but they dont take away from the whole at all.  This seasons low points in my opinion was not doing enough with faith, turning buffy into a bit of a B**** towards the end of the year, and the too short appearance of angel.  but these are just minor things and dont really even matter on the buffy season 7 scale.  This season was the best in a long time and i have watched buffy sence day 1 so all you people who came in at season 4 and think that this season wasnt the same as seasons 4-6 should check out seasons 1-3 if you want the true essence of BUFFY.

I think that the fans of this show all have their on view on the show. the one thing that I think we can all agree with is that this show was very well written for the most part and it was a much better show than the title would lead those who did not watch it, to believe. The only thing that I would say I did not like was the way some of the charactors changed namely Willow making her gay, that was like a cheap trick to make it interesting. (which it did not) adding Dawn was another cheap way to add something that just did not need to be.

Just because David is a better actor then Sarah, no offense, but she got annoying at points in this season, like in Lies My Parents Told Me, or how about, Never Leave Me? Spike was right, she should have killed him, but instead came up with this list of good things he did, which doesn't even compare to the amount of bad he has done. And, enough of that, here's my review, including everything except the commentaries which are always good in the Buffyverse, and even on Dark Angel, surprisingly:Lessons- 4.5/5 Buffy goes down into the basement of the new high school, to find weird ghost things haunting the place, and to save her sister who has been trapped down there, also with a more then insane, Spike.Beneath You- 5/5 One of my favourites on the season. Anya has turned a girl's ex-boyfriend into a slaugh demon, which is like a gigantic worm. After Xander convinces Anya to turn him back, Spike accidentally kills the man and takes off back into the basement, where he hides, and talks to the first. Buffy finds out he got a soul.Same Time, Same Place- 4.5/5 A Willow episode, which is good, she wasn't in this season nearly as much as the last, and I kinda missed her. She was the only character in the season that I really liked in every episode! Props on Willow, the best character the ever created. And Alyson even more, the girl in the pilot was just dreadful!Help- 4/5 Casey is a girl, just with the instinct that she will die this Friday, but Buffy will do everything she can to make sure she lives. I didn't really care that much for Casey, but it was cool seeing Zachary Ty Bryan again, I used to love Home Improvement.Selfless- 5/5 Anya's big episode, personally, I think she should have died here, she was never really needed for the rest of the season, but I still like her, she was just never useful to the gang, except in the Gift, and for her much needed sarcasm.Him- 3.5/5 Dawn gets back to whine mode in this one, but only over a spell, then it gets funny, love the ending. Also, the flashback to Xander's love spell in season 2.Conversations with Dead People- 4.5/5 A lot of people consider this to be the best of the season, or the highlight, and I can't argue, this is amazing, but not the best.Sleeper- 5/5 Spike is killing again, only he has no memmory of doing so, and is being used as the puppet of the first.Never Leave Me- 4.5/5 Buffy helps Spike remember about all the people he has killed, and Spike wants Buffy to kill him before he escapes again. And of course, Buffy's just more then annoying here, have to hand it to her, I never thought she would be the most annoying character, but she was.Bring on the Night- 5/5 Welcome back Giles, and Buffy finally gets what's coming to her, an Uber Vamp, or as the call it, Turok-Han. Drusilla returns as the First.Showtime- 5/5 Buffy wants to rescue Spike, but knows she has to defeat the Turok-Han which has been giving her more then a hard time. She, Willow and Xander make a plan that helps her in defeating the Turok-Han. Lalaine(Miranda on Lizzie Mcguire) plays Chloe.Potential- 4/5 Willow gets in contact with one of the witches at the college, who said the have located a new potential, here in Sunnydale... Dawn, or is it?The Killer in Me- 5/5 I loved this episode, but only because it's Willow based. And the line, ""It was Warren"" was beyond corny. The whole Buffy/Spike in the Iniative was kinda dull, plus the fight, you couldn't see anything, wasn't exciting at all. But is Giles the First? We don't know, but if you watch carefully at the beginning of the episode, you can see Giles clean his glasses, but they just sneak that in. Alyson gets the best performance here, she rules!! And I hate Amy, Willow should burn that girl, like she did to Warren.First Date- 4/5 Ashanti guest stars, and she wasn't great, she wasn't bad, she was just ok. Buffy goes on a date with Principal Wood, and she finds out a little more about him. Meanwhile, Spike interrupts their date to tell them that Xander is in trouble, and on date with yet, another demon.Get It Done- 4.5/5 Buffy goes back a couple of hundred years and discovers more about the slayer.Storyteller- 3.5/5 Andrew was getting annoying, it's about time they made Buffy the annoying one and put Andrew in the spotlight where he can be likeable again.Lies My Parents Told Me- 5/5 Wood found out that Spike killed Wood's mother, who was a slayer, and he decides to take his revenge after convincing Giles that Spike is still a threat. Only, things don't go so well, and if it wasn't for Buffy, Wood would be dead. By far one of the best of the season.Dirty Girls- 5/5 Bring in Faith, Caleb, who is a nasty bad guy, and after Buffy makes a reckless decision, risks Xander's life and more potentials are killed by Caleb, you have to thank the man, potentials=annoying, though I didn't mind Kennedy before the whole Willow romance thing and she did have a few good lines, but other then that, she was irritating.Empty Places- 5/5 Finally, Buffy gets the so long after trying to make an even more reckless decision then what happened in the last episode. Everyone teams up against her, except Spike and Andrew who are out discovering more about what Caleb is protecting at the Viniard. Faith becomes the new boss!! Just one question, why didn't they just put Willow against Caleb? I mean, she could take him, she took out Buffy with no problems. Hopefully magic works on the guy.Touched- 4/5 Pretty boring episode, with the only noteable performance going to Harry Groener, who returns as the Mayor/The First.End of Days- 4.5/5 After a big explosion, killing even more potentials, Buffy is put back in charge and escapes with a scythe(hope's dagger).Chosen- 5/5 Willow uses the dagger and makes every potential slayer into a slayer, after Angel returns and Buffy kills Caleb. Buffy tells Angel to go work on a second front, as she decides to go into the hellmouth and finish this, at last.Overall, I'd say this is probably the second worst season in terms of development, character, and episode by episode basis. I would say it would go like this: 3, 6, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1. Season 6, a lot of people thought that was bad, but look at all the highlight episodes: Bargaining, Life Serial, Once More, with Feeling, Tabula Rasa, Normal Again, Seeing Red and of course, Villains-Grave. Season 3 had so many good episode, no wonder it's the best, though Angel season 2 takes it all. Season 5 of Bts, the whole Glory thing, the tragic episodes like the Gift and The Body, the funny ones such as Buffy vs. Dracula, the Real Me and Triangle. A great season. Season 2 had the best storyarc, but just too many weak episodes like: Some Assembly Required, Bad Eggs and Go Fish(where the only notable performance is David's as Angelus). Season 4 had so many fantastic episodes that stood out, like Hush, Who Are You?, This Year's Girl, Restless, Harsh Light of day & Something Blue. But it did have its weak episode, I won't go into that. Season 1 was a great story arc season, but it just wasn't nearly as good as the rest of the seasons.Special Features- Include bloopers, wrap-up party, documentaries, and Joss Whedon's top 10 Buffy episode, which include-10.

849388,A1EYS0SF2CWUQJ,B0002XVKMC,"Buffy ""topaz@shaka.com""","[3, 8]","""Buffy"" is my favorite TV show of all time and I was not disappointed by this final season. I loved the concept of  gathering the Potential Slayers from all around the world and the brilliant and final 'big bad'. What other show would think of taking a villian seen briefly in one episode of season 3 and making them the ultimate big bad for the show's last season? If you're a fan of the show, you realize that the final villian really couldn't have been anything else. In my opinion, this was one of the more thrilling and heart wrenching seasons of the show's run. There are some very shocking moments and the return of many of the fans' favorite characters. This season also features the fabulous Nathan Fillion from Joss Whedon's other show ""Firefly"" and the movie ""Serenity"". Some of the standout episodes are ""Conversations w/ Dead People"", ""First Date"", the hilarious ""Storyteller"", ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" and of course, the series finale.

849389,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B0002XVKMC,Busy Body,"[5, 7]","The first time I really got into Buffy The Vampire Slayer was during the summer of 2000 when I had just moved house. In those five years it has gone on to easily become my favourite television show all time. Nothing will ever take its place, because Buffy is clever and different on a number of levels. I was sad when the news broke that Season Seven was to be the final series, but I think in many ways I - like many other millions of fans - knew it was time to end it before it went stale. Therefore, we all had high expectations for Season Seven, so what went wrong?In my opinion, this season of Buffy is very good and in contrast to many other television shows, it is truly stellar. However, there was something about Season Seven that didn't make as interesting or gripping as previous seasons. I have to say that even though there are many good episodes in this season, this is the worst season of all seven. I loved Season Six, so to go from that to this was slightly disappointing for me. I believe Joss Whedon's vision remained clear until the very end, but something went wrong in this season which I believe is due to the fact that the writers and producers were too pre-occupied with creating something so epic that they forgot the core of the show: the strength between Buffy and her circle of friends in times of crisis.The Big Bad of this season is The First. It can't take corporal form which means no one can fight it, but only its minions. Compared to other Big Bads, The First is very poor. We had Evil Willow and Glory in previous series who were both amazing, while The First has to employ The Bringers to attack the Slayer. The Bringers are so boring it's unbelievable, and I think the producers and writers were hoping that The First would keep viewers interested because it can take the form of Buffy. However, after the fifth time it becomes very boring knowing that The First can manipulate others to its own advantage. In previous seasons, we had a mixture of episodes that involved the personal stories of the Scooby Gang and also the build up to the big finale. One such example is Season 5 where Buffy's mom dies in ""The Body."" This is a personal tragedy totally unrelated to Glory's determination to find The Key, but subsequent episodes return to the drama of the season's main theme. Every single episode after ""Conversations"" in this season is about The First, and no offence, but it becomes quite boring. Buffy's grandiose speeches, Andrew's tired jokes and Willow's forced 'relationship' with Kennedy become mediocre. Characters such as Anya and Xander don't have a place anymore, and only serve to fill up episode time.Part of the season's strength lies in Spike, whose new soul causes him torment at the hands of The First. This story plays a big part in the first ten episodes of the season, but it isn't overdone or drawn out. More importantly, I felt compelled to keep watching to find out how things worked out for him. I also like the development between Buffy and Spike. From seething hatred in Season 2, through to his crush on her in Season 5, and their sexual escapades in Season 6, the two characters have come full circle. They both have mutual respect for one another, and what is interesting is how Buffy has changed such a powerful vampire. There is always a thick line if irony running through the show, which is seen in Season 2 as Buffy falls in love with Angel. As Giles puts it, ""A vampire in love with a Slayer. It's rather poetic.""The aim of Season Seven was to inject ""much-needed comic relief"" after the harshness of Season Six, and for the most part it works. ""Lessons,"" ""Beneath You,"" ""Same Time Same Place,"" ""Help"" and ""Him"" are five really great episodes that deal with a number of issues such as Spike's return, his subsequent insanity, Willow's return to Sunnydale, the rebuilding of Sunnydale High School, and the trouble that is brewing in the Hellmouth. These episodes aren't too heavy and are quite light, and work very well in my opinion. ""Selfless"" is one of the season's best episodes, and has stellar acting performances from Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan and Emma Caulfield. ""Conversations With Dead People"" is incredible as many fans will tell you.From here on the episodes become more generic and boring. The arrival of The Potential Slayers really doesn't help, because there's too many of them. With Buffy being such an intimate and emotional show, the fans are content and happy with the main characters (Buffy, Willow, Xander, Spike, Dawn, Giles, Anya) but the addition of all these young women is just too much. I can't really remember any of their names (apart from Kennedy, who is very boring) and this is because I don't care for them. I'm too focused on the main characters, and I think it was a big mistake for the writers to add all these potential Slayers half way through the season. There are still some good episodes such as ""Lies My Parents Told Me,"" ""Storyteller"" and ""Get It Done."" The arrival of the Turok-Han is pitiful and incredibly dull. We have to endure two full episodes, ""Bring On The Night"" and ""Showtime,"" where Buffy and all her friends struggle to fight just one of these original vampires. How come they pick them off in seconds in the final episode then? Yeah, we're told it's because of the scythe that Buffy removes from Caleb's lair and that the Slayers have become 'imbued' with the power of all would-be Slayers around the world. Hmmm, how convenient that this happens just as the Hellmouth opens. Plus, how come the whole of Sunnydale evacuates town just a few episodes before the final episode? To me it seems highly unlikely that everyone would just leave when demons and vampires are kept secret from the public.I also have a bit of trouble in one of the final episodes where every character seems to be having sex, and why we have to endure about 10 minutes of it. Anya and Xander have sex, but for me that's not enough. They should have got back together so that we could have at least been left with the illusion that they would get married at some point in the future. However, I guess this was pointless as Anya died in the final episode in such a poor way. Faith's return seemed rather forced too, and her sexcapades with Principal Wood were uncalled for. I was also annoyed at Willow making love to Kennedy because Tara 'would want her to move on.' Tara and Willow were one of the show's best ever couples and I think messing with that was a bad thing. Kennedy is flat and boring, whereas Tara was sensitive and caring. Maybe I'm just bitter, I don't know. Also to the reviewer who was disgusted by two women kissing, I suggest you switch Buffy off and go back to your fanatical religious beliefs about how women should be with men and no one else and stop trying to force them onto us more open-minded citizens.All in all I think this season was good in parts but pretty bad in others. ""Chosen"" is a great episode on its own, but stacked against previous season finales like ""The Gift,"" ""Becoming Part II"" and ""Restless,"" it pales in comparison. Buffy was an incredible show and for seven seasons it gripped me like nothing else. I'm glad the show ended at Season Seven because it was the right time to go. The legacy is preserved now and this show should rightfully be hailed as one of the Top 10 TV Shows in history.",4,Overall Good But Some Bad Moments,1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,7355,"['first',

849390,AVBOCSETZ2VQ9,B0002XVKMC,"California Dreamin ""sr538""","[4, 6]","Just finished watching the season 7 DVD set.  From other reviews, I was prepared for a disappointment.  What a surprise - season 7 was great!  A lot of the trouble may be that one can't just jump in to season 7.  Much of the humor and storyline comes from continuity and previously developed themes.Each episode had enough sharp dialog, plot and humor to keep me riveted and amused, and the action and special effects were very good.  The sequence when Buffy was working at the school and counseling the girl who had a difficult sister had me rolling on the floor laughing.  Also several characters were extremely well treated this season - Andrew, Robin Wood, Willow, Xander and Spike.  The monsters were great.  Nathan Fillion was excellent as the evil preacher Caleb, far better cast here than he was in Firefly.My only negative comment about season 7 is that the DVDs loose tracking at the beginnings of Episodes 4 and 9.  These seemed to be production defects not scratches.  Nevertheless I was able to enjoy most of these two episodes, and will still give this set a rating of 5 stars.(If I do jump in anywhere it is with the episode ""Hush"" in season 5.  I've shown ""Hush"" to friends who had never seen Buffy, and they then had to go and watch every episode :)",5,Under-rated,1100995200,"11 21, 2004",2004,1266,"['Just', 'finished', 'watching', 'season', '7', 'DVD', 'set', 'other', 'reviews', 'was', 'prepared', 'disappointment', 'What', 'surprise', 'season', '7', 'was', 'great', 'lot', 'trouble', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'jump', 'season', '7', 'Much', 'humor', 'storyline', 'continuity', 'previously', 'developed', 'themes.Each', 'episode', 'had', 'enough', 'sharp', 'dialog', 'plot', 'humor', 'keep', 'riveted', 'amused', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'sequence', 'when', 'Buffy', 'was', 'working', 'school', 'counseling', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'difficult', 'sister', 'had', 'rolling', 'floor', 'laughing', 'Also', 'several', 'characters', 'were', 'extremely', 'well', 'treated', 'season', 'Andrew', 'Robin', 'Wood', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'Spike', 'monsters', 'were', 'great', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'was', 'excellent', 'evil', 'preacher', 'Caleb', 'far', 'better', 'cast', 'here', 'was', 'Firefly.My', 'only', 'negative', 'comment', 'season', '7', 'DVDs', 'loose', 'tracking', 'beginnings', 'Episodes', '4', '9', 'seemed', 'be', 'production', 'defects', 'not', 'scratches', 'Nevertheless', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'most', 'two', 'episodes', 'will', 'still', 'give', 'set', 'rating', '5', 'stars', 'do', 'jump', 'anywhere', 'episode', 'Hush', 'season', '5', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'Hush', 'friends', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Buffy', 'then', 'had', 'go', 'watch', 'episode']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season
849391,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0002XVKMC,calvinnme,"[1, 3]","Buffy season seven is the weakest season of the series, but it is still above average television. The strength of the season lies not in the season's story arcs, but in some of the individual episodes. For example, ""Selfless"" artfully examines Anya's past and present life and reveals that she feels like she has never quite fit in as a human, but she no longer has the killer instinct to continue on in her second incarnation as a vengeance demon either. ""Conversations With Dead People"" ranks right up there with ""Hush"" in its scariness. The only way that this episode could have been improved upon is if Tara was the face of the ghost speaking to Willow, but with actress Amber Benson unwilling to reprise her role that season, it was really beyond the show's control. ""Storyteller"" is hilarious as Andrew narrates a film about the Scoobies, and ""Lies Your Parents Told You"" is another fine showcase of James Marsters' acting talent as we finally learn the source of the ""trigger"" that the First Evil has been using to control Spike.Now for what is not good about this season... The series strong point- the growth and interaction of the main characters- is crowded out by the arrival of the potential slayers in episode ten. Giles return, which should have been a boost to the series, just muddled matters even more since he in no way resembles the character we have come to know in previous seasons. Other reviewers have referred to him as ""Pod Giles"", and I have to agree this moniker fits his season seven persona to a tee. Once the mystery of the season's ""big bad"" is revealed- an evil force that can take on the form of any dead person but cannot interact with the world around it- there is really no place else to go with this storyline as we do not have in the ""First Evil"" a villain worthy of reflection such as season three's Mayor or season two's Angelus. Kennedy, Willow's new love interest, is not a convincing actress, and the two's relationship falls flat. Although I would expect Willow to eventually get over Tara's death and move on with a new love interest, I could not figure out why THIS is the person she would choose to move on with. The two have absolutely no chemistry. Spike's big decision to regain his soul and his success at doing so is apparently explained by Buffy to the other main characters offscreen, and we viewers are denied the depth of treatment that revelation should have received. By episode eighteen, when the final story arc is launched, it seems that the writers and actors are phoning in their performances as they know the show will not be renewed for another season.Then there are all of the plot holes and inconsistency in the writing. For example, according to Giles, after visiting the oracle of Beljoxa's Eye, the First Evil has appeared on the scene because of the slayer herself - because she has died and returned. But Buffy died the first time at the end of season one. So why has the First Evil waited all of this time to appear? In ""Showtime"" the ubervamps appear almost impossible to kill, so why by the finale are even the potentials slicing through them like butter? At first we are told that the seal over the Hellmouth is not opened by Jonathan's death because there is not enough blood. Then why are only a few drops of Spike's blood sufficient to do the job? Why does D'hoffryn decline to kill Anya at the conclusion of ""Selfless"", even at her request, but in later episodes has his minions trying to kill her? And the list goes on. Gross inconsistencies in the storyline such as this just didn't occur in previous seasons.Finally, ""Chosen"", Joss Whedon's series finale, is mediocre when compared to shows from other seasons that he has written that did not have the importance that this final episode should have had, with a couple of exceptions. I did think that Whedon found a clever way to set Buffy free to live a normal life without her having to abandon her duties. I also liked the scene the day of the final battle with Buffy, Willow, and Xander, the original scoobies, having a conversation reminiscent of the closing scene of ""The Harvest"", which was the second part of the two-part premiere from season one. As they carry on their superficial banter about shopping, Giles repeats the same line that he said in this same situation in ""The Harvest"" - ""The world is doomed."" This was a real treat for long-time viewers and did indeed bring us ""back to the beginning"" - which was the theme of season seven.",3,"Some great episodes, a not so great season story arc",1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,4483,"['Buffy', 'season', 'seven', 'weakest', 'season', 'series', 'still', 'above', 'average', 'television', 'strength', 'season', 'not', 'season', 'story', 'arcs', 'individual', 'episodes', 'example', 'Selfless', 'artfully', 'Anya', 'past', 'present', 'life', 'reveals', 'never', 'quite', 'fit', 'human', 'no', 'longer', 'killer', 'instinct', 'continue', 'second', 'incarnation', 'vengeance', 'demon', 'either', 'Conversations', 'Dead', 'People', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Hush', 'scariness', 'only', 'way', 'episode', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'upon', 'Tara', 'was', 'face', 'ghost', 'speaking', 'Willow', 'actress', 'Amber', 'Benson', 'unwilling', 'reprise', 'role', 'season', 'was', 'really', 'show', 'control', 'Storyteller', 'hilarious', 'Andrew', 'film', 'Scoobies', 'Parents', 'Told', 'fine', 'showcase', 'James', 'Marsters', 'acting', 'talent', 'finally', 'learn', 'source', 'trigger', 'First', 'Evil', 'been', 'using', 'control', 'Spike.Now', 'what', 'not', 'good', 'season', 'series', 'strong', 'point-', 'growth', 'interaction', 'main', 'characters-', 'crowded', 'out', 'arrival', 'potential', 'slayers', 'episode', 'ten', 'Giles', 'return', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'boost', 'series', 'just', 'muddled', 'matters', 'even', 'more', 'way', 'character', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'referred', 'Pod', 'Giles', 'have', 'agree', 'moniker', 'season', 'seven', 'persona', 'tee', 'mystery', 'season', 'big', 'bad', 'revealed-', 'evil', 'force', 'can', 'take', 'form', 'dead', 'person', 'can', 'not', 'interact', 'world', 'it-', 'really', 'place', 'else', 'go', 'storyline', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'First', 'Evil', 'villain', 'worthy', 'reflection', 'such', 'season', 'three', 'Mayor', 'season', 'two', 'Angelus', 'Kennedy', 'Willow', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'not', 'convincing', 'actress', 'two', 'relationship', 'flat', 'would', 'expect', 'Willow', 'eventually', 'get', 'Tara', 'death', 'move', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'THIS', 'person', 'would', 'choose', 'move', 'two', 'have', 'absolutely', 'chemistry', 'Spike', 'big', 'decision', 'regain', 'soul', 'success', 'doing', 'so', 'apparently', 'explained', 'Buffy', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'offscreen', 'viewers', 'are', 'denied', 'depth', 'treatment', 'revelation', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'episode', 'eighteen', 'when', 'final', 'story', 'arc', 'launched', 'writers', 'actors', 'are', 'phoning', 'performances', 'know', 'show', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'renewed', 'season.Then', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'inconsistency', 'writing', 'example', 'according', 'Giles', 'visiting', 'oracle', 'Beljoxa', 'Eye', 'First', 'Evil', 'appeared', 'scene', 'slayer', 'died', 'returned', 'Buffy', 'died', 'first', 'time', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'So', 'why', 'First', 'Evil', 'waited', 'time', 'appear', 'Showtime', 'ubervamps', 'appear', 'almost', 'impossible', 'kill', 'so', 'why', 'finale', 'are', 'even', 'potentials', 'slicing', 'butter', 'first', 'are', 'told', 'seal', 'Hellmouth', 'not', 'opened', 'Jonathan', 'death', 'not', 'enough', 'blood', 'Then', 'why', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'drops', 'Spike', 'blood', 'sufficient', 'do', 'job', 'Why', ""D'hoffryn"", 'decline', 'kill', 'Anya', 'conclusion', 'Selfless', 'even', 'request', 'later', 'episodes', 'minions', 'trying', 'kill', 'list', 'Gross', 'inconsistencies', 'storyline', 'such', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'occur', 'previous', 'seasons.Finally', 'Chosen', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'series', 'finale', 'mediocre', 'when', 'compared', 'shows', 'other', 'seasons', 'written', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'importance', 'final', 'episode', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'couple', 'exceptions', 'did', 'think', 'Whedon', 'found', 'clever', 'way', 'set', 'Buffy', 'free', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'having', 'abandon', 'duties', 'also', 'liked', 'scene', 'day', 'final', 'battle', 'Buffy', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'original', 'scoobies', 'having', 'conversation', 'reminiscent', 'closing', 'scene', 'Harvest', 'was', 'second', 'part', 'two-part', 'premiere', 'season', 'one', 'carry', 'superficial', 'banter', 'shopping', 'Giles', 'same', 'line', 'said', 'same', 'situation', 'Harvest', 'world', 'doomed', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'long-time', 'viewers', 'did', 'indeed', 'bring', 'back', 'beginning', 'was', 'theme', 'season', 'seven']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

That's what made the first and second seasons so much better than the later ones.

I hate that kind of trickery.  Most reviewers say they hated the ""potentials"", but I thought that was more like the earlier days of the series, the dialogues were witty, the reactions honest.  The Xander part (the eye) was just wrong - Giles was annoying and almost seemed like a ""bad guy"" most of the time - Spike was weak - Anya turned wimpy and Willow was sad and scared all the time.

While I feel severn seven plays much better on dvd than it did week to week on network tv, there are still problems with it that aren't there in the other seasons.True, the potentials were annoying, but the thing that drives me nuts through this season is the character of Kennedy, Willow's new girlfriend. In my opinion, Willow fell in love with both Oz and Tara because of their personalities, not because of what gender they belonged to. Both of those relationships, while hard in places, were extremely special, warm and kind.I don't believe for one second Willow would have gotten together with Kennedy, or that Kennedy was so trained right from the start that she was allowed to train the new potentials. I think if anyone should have been, it should have been Xander (because of his mental military training).I wish the creators would have been able to bring both Tara and Oz back for the final season so that Willow could be happy and relaize she did not need to be in a relationship to be happy or be complete, she, like everyone else in the show, has her friends and her own heart to keep her warm.The ending was brilliant though.

To make things worse the chip which was working as a harness so Spike couldn't kill humans happens to be malfunctioning and is killing him.

Without even knowing if Spike really changed at ALL! Cause even with a soul it doesn't seem that Spike regretted killing any of his victims including Robin Woods mother who happened to be the NYC Slayer Nikki Woods. And Spike continues to use that leather coat that she wore! Is that balls or what???  But 4 episodes prior Anya was killing again but Buffy, being the hypocrite she is wants to kill her because it's her duty! ""What the (...)?!"" First it seemed The First Evil needed Spike's blood to open The Seal of Danthazar that opens the Hellmouth thus using Spike as their puppet. Because their initial attempt at using human blood (Jonathan's. They made Andrew kill him using Warren's form. Andrew was in love with Warren. I just know it. That's why they used his form) didn't work. So The First Evil thought that Spike was the key which is why it sent it's Bringers to attack Buffy's house and capture the newly soulled vampire. And presto the seal opened. But after that it seemed anyone's blood could open or close the seal. INCLUDING Xander's! (...) I really hate Buffy this season! This by all means is not a disrespect at Sarah Michelle Gellar. She's a great actress and I recenty foun out she had problems with the direction her character and the show was going. So she quit. Thankfully! A woman of morales. Kudos to you girl!  Why do I have season 7 on dvd?

849397,A2F18IRDZCNOLP,B0002XVKMC,"Christopher Miner ""Chris""","[7, 16]","If you are a Buffy fan, you already know that this season was not the greatest.  It did have the continuation of the Spike story line and the return of Faith, both very good things.  But there are only a few stand out episodes, like ""Conversations With Dead People"", that were better than average.  This set is a must have to complete your Buffy DVD collection, but is not a great place for new fans or the curious to start (Try season 2 instead).  The reason I gave this set a 2 is because I am rating this product and not necessarily the season itself, which is more subjective.  Fox needs to change their packaging, and their production methods in general, for producing DVDs.  Anytime you but a set, whether it's Buffy or Lord of the Rings, it will have DVDs that are scratched in it.  I have bought all of the Buffy and Angel sets, that's 11 sets.  Of those, only 3 did not have scratched discs.  Which meant returning them numerous times until I could put together a workable set.  The bottom line is this, if you buy this online look forward to a headache.  Your best bet is to buy where you can easily return.  Consider yourself warned.

849398,A3OBVA38RYSHI7,B0002XVKMC,Chuck Mengel,"[0, 2]","OK... First let me say I'm a die hard Buffy fan. Every other season was amazing and had me literally jumping outa my seat with excitement, but season seven was just terrible for its usual fun and fresh seasons. I think the best way to voice my opinion is to list the things I disliked about the season 7:The ""Big Bad"" of the season wasnt so big or bad at all. For the first evil and sole reason for sin on earth, this villian absolutely sucked. He could not take corporial form therefore couldnt touch or be touched. Because of this, Buffy never physically fought the ""First"". He had to call upon other bad guys to do his dirty work. The only breath of fresh air ""The First"" brought to the season was taking the form of some of the dead characters from previous seasons, but once the shock of it wore off it left you asking yourself, ""Is that it? Is that all he can do?""Anya and Zander seemed to be in a lull throughout. They would make love now and again but nothing would come of it, and once they killed her off Zander and Anya's story never seemed to wrap up. In fact Zander didnt even seem to care that his girlfriend was dead.Season 7 didnt introduce anything new. The episodes seemed to repeat themselves from previous years and dragged on borishly, especially during the middle where the season started to lose my interest. I found some of the episodes so terrible I wanted to fast forward to the end, such as ""Storyteller"", ""Same Time Same Place"",and ""Empty Places"". Yet there were few great episodes too like, ""Conversations with Dead People"", ""Him"", and ""Dirty Girls"".Spike and Buffy's relationship I found to be totally bizarre and it took me out of the story. Spike used to be so bad ass but now seems so ""Buffy-whipped"" its pathetic. She doesnt want spike but doesnt want anyone else to have him.The story line about the potential slayers was so off putting. You didnt even get to know half of there names let alone feel for them if they were killed. For most of the season they were totally useless and whinny, and a majority of time was focused on training them to become more powerful Slayers. The introduction of a completely new cast was overwhelming.The last episode got so ridiculous I found myself cringing at times. In the begining of the season the Uber-Vampires were nealry impossible to kill, yet the last episode turns into a ""Lord of the Rings"" type battle where the Potential slayers (after Willow puts a spell on them to make them stronger) kill thousands of them easy as pie. Just when they start losing the battle Spike randomly glows really bright, turns all the other vamps to dust and dies himself, right before the entire town of Sunnydale collapses into the ground. It was way over-the-top.I did enjoy the return of Faith, my absolute favorite character in the series, and the introduction of the evil preacher, Caleb. He was the only formidable villian of the season, yet the final battle between him and Buffy was pathetic. He was killed so easily and fast it left me wanting to see more of him. In my opinion, I think he should have been the ""Big Bad"" of the season.Seven was the absolute worst season of all the seasons. It felt as if the writers were tired of working on the show and half-assed it, but if your a die hard Buffy fan its worth a watch for the few good episodes and closure, just dont expect the classic edge of your seat, laugh-fest, thrill coaster kinda Buffy.",3,WTF Happend???,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",2009,3418,"['OK', 'First', 'let', 'say', ""'m"", 'die', 'hard', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'other', 'season', 'was', 'amazing', 'had', 'literally', 'jumping', 'seat', 'excitement', 'season', 'seven', 'was', 'just', 'terrible', 'usual', 'fun', 'fresh', 'seasons', 'think', 'best', 'way', 'voice', 'opinion', 'list', 'things', 'disliked', 'season', '7', 'Big', 'Bad', 'season', 'wasnt', 'so', 'big', 'bad', 'first', 'evil', 'sole', 'reason', 'sin', 'earth', 'villian', 'absolutely', 'sucked', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'corporial', 'form', 'therefore', 'couldnt', 'touch', 'be', 'touched', 'Buffy', 'never', 'physically', 'fought', 'First', 'had', 'call', 'other', 'bad', 'guys', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'only', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'First', 'brought', 'season', 'was', 'taking', 'form', 'dead', 'characters', 'previous', 'seasons', 'once', 'shock', 'wore', 'off', 'left', 'asking', 'can', 'do', 'Anya', 'Zander', 'seemed', 'be', 'lull', 'would', 'make', 'love', 'now', 'again', 'nothing', 'would', 'come', 'once', 'killed', 'off', 'Zander', 'Anya', 'story', 'never', 'seemed', 'wrap', 'up', 'fact', 'Zander', 'didnt', 'even', 'seem', 'care', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'dead.Season', '7', 'didnt', 'introduce', 'anything', 'new', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'repeat', 'previous', 'years', 'dragged', 'borishly', 'especially', 'middle', 'where', 'season', 'started', 'lose', 'interest', 'found', 'episodes', 'terrible', 'wanted', 'fast', 'forward', 'end', 'such', 'Storyteller', 'Same', 'Time', 'Same', 'Place', 'Empty', 'Places', 'were', 'few', 'great', 'episodes', 'too', 'Conversations', 'Dead', 'People', 'Him', 'Dirty', 'Girls', '.Spike', 'Buffy', 'relationship', 'found', 'be', 'totally', 'bizarre', 'took', 'story', 'Spike', 'used', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'ass', 'now', 'Buffy-whipped', 'pathetic', 'doesnt', 'want', 'spike', 'doesnt', 'want', 'anyone', 'else', 'have', 'him.The', 'story', 'line', 'potential', 'slayers', 'was', 'so', 'putting', 'didnt', 'even', 'get', 'know', 'half', 'names', 'let', 'alone', 'feel', 'were', 'killed', 'most', 'season', 'were', 'totally', 'useless', 'whinny', 'majority', 'time', 'was', 'focused', 'training', 'become', 'more', 'powerful', 'Slayers', 'introduction', 'completely', 'new', 'cast', 'was', 'overwhelming.The', 'last', 'episode', 'got', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'found', 'cringing', 'times', 'begining', 'season', 'Uber-Vampires', 'were', 'nealry', 'impossible', 'kill', 'yet', 'last', 'episode', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'type', 'battle', 'where', 'Potential', 'slayers', 'Willow', 'spell', 'make', 'stronger', 'kill', 'thousands', 'easy', 'pie', 'Just', 'when', 'start', 'losing', 'battle', 'Spike', 'randomly', 'really', 'bright', 'other', 'vamps', 'dust', 'right', 'entire', 'town', 'Sunnydale', 'ground', 'was', 'way', 'over-the-top.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'return', 'Faith', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'character', 'series', 'introduction', 'evil', 'preacher', 'Caleb', 'was', 'only', 'formidable', 'villian', 'season', 'final', 'battle', 'Buffy', 'was', 'pathetic', 'was', 'killed', 'so', 'easily', 'fast', 'left', 'wanting', 'see', 'more', 'opinion', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Big', 'Bad', 'season.Seven', 'was', 'absolute', 'worst', 'season', 'seasons', 'felt', 'writers', 'were', 'tired', 'working', 'show', 'half-assed', 'die', 'hard', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'worth', 'watch', 'few', 'good', 'episodes', 'closure', 'just', 'dont', 'expect', 'classic', 'edge', 'seat', 'laugh-fest', 'thrill', 'coaster', 'kinda', 'Buffy']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

849400,AE2KCASMQPMO,B0002XVKMC,"C. Meja ""CMM""","[3, 3]","With this release, the Buffy series finally comes to an end... comes full circle, as Joss Whedon says in several ocasions. The season opens with Buffy teaching Dawn how to fight a vampire (after a teaser in which a girl gets killed): very interesting way to start the season. The new Sunnydale high opens for the first time since the scooby gang blew it up in the end of season 3... school Dawn is to attend, much for the dislike of Buffy. By the end of the first episode (""Lessons""), the new principal (Robin Wood) hires Buffy as help for the students, and Spike, who has lost his mind and lives now in the basement of the school, is being haunted by something capable to take the form of dead people.  As the season advances we understand the nature of the new big bad and how the potential slayers are in danger and need now, not only to be protected by Buffy, but to be taught on fight and war. This is not a bad season at all, as many people have said. If season 6 seemed a bit unorganized (as the characters were - I loved season 6: it is one of my favorites)season 7 has clearly each step leading to the next one. The big turning point is the excellent episode called ""Conversations with dead people"", in which the big bad makes its first attack on the gang and the remaining duo from the trio comes back: Andrew and Jonathan. The season moves in a very specific direction from that point on: Buffy begins to receive slayers in her house, and Andrew becomes slowly a part of the group. The arc for the characters is also very clear: Buffy begins to face what it means to have the power she has in a moment like that: her solitude is now cearly stated in connection to her superiority or inferiority. This leading to the desintegration of the group near the end of the season, in which one of the main characters gets seriously injured. Willow takes the path to restart her love life (with a potential) as well as to embrace her power beyond her fears. Xander's importance in the scoobies is finally said: his ability to see what the others do, and to maintain the unity of the group... of course, by the end of the season he will be key in the crisis of the group. Spike's journey will be to understand what it meand to have a soul. Then there are those who return like Faith and Giles... and those new: principal Wood (whose alliance with Buffy will be somewhat unstable because of Spike). The season builds on a steady pace, which can really be cherished by watching as many episodes as you can, one after the other... the structure of the season really gets one hooked. Appart from the quality of the episodes (I do not think there is a single one that I didn't like, which usually happens with every season -As you were in season 6; I was made to love you in 5, etc) the extras are quite good: the bloopers are funny and the documentaries are clear and interesting. The audio-commentaries are sometimes somewhat boring (for my surprise, the commentary for Lessons by Joss Whedon is not so good)... but then there is the commentary to Dirty Girls in which the writer really gives interesting insights to the way he structured the episode around the way men objectivize women... and the one for Chosen by J. Whedon is excelent.The finale is really big, cinematic and dinamic... the battle with supervamps is exciting and there is not a single moment of boredom in Chosen (appart from the return of Angel, character I never liked, but that is personal, so forget it).Buffy really goes out with a bang... and then a collpasing of the ground... and then a big crater-like hole in the earth.",5,The end,1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,3596,"['release', 'Buffy', 'series', 'finally', 'end', 'full', 'circle', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'several', 'ocasions', 'season', 'Buffy', 'teaching', 'Dawn', 'how', 'fight', 'vampire', 'teaser', 'girl', 'killed', 'very', 'interesting', 'way', 'start', 'season', 'new', 'Sunnydale', 'high', 'opens', 'first', 'time', 'scooby', 'gang', 'blew', 'up', 'end', 'season', '3', 'school', 'Dawn', 'attend', 'much', 'dislike', 'Buffy', 'end', 'first', 'episode', 'Lessons', 'new', 'principal', 'Robin', 'Wood', 'Buffy', 'help', 'students', 'Spike', 'who', 'lost', 'mind', 'lives', 'now', 'basement', 'school', 'being', 'haunted', 'something', 'capable', 'take', 'form', 'dead', 'people', 'season', 'understand', 'nature', 'new', 'big', 'bad', 'how', 'potential', 'slayers', 'are', 'danger', 'need', 'now', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'protected', 'Buffy', 'be', 'taught', 'fight', 'war', 'not', 'bad', 'season', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'season', '6', 'seemed', 'bit', 'unorganized', 'characters', 'were', 'loved', 'season', '6', 'one', 'favorites', 'season', '7', 'clearly', 'step', 'leading', 'next', 'one', 'big', 'turning', 'point', 'excellent', 'episode', 'called', 'Conversations', 'dead', 'people', 'big', 'bad', 'first', 'attack', 'gang', 'remaining', 'duo', 'trio', 'back', 'Andrew', 'Jonathan', 'season', 'moves', 'very', 'specific', 'direction', 'point', 'Buffy', 'receive', 'slayers', 'house', 'Andrew', 'slowly', 'part', 'group', 'arc', 'characters', 'also', 'very', 'clear', 'Buffy', 'face', 'what', 'have', 'power', 'moment', 'solitude', 'now', 'cearly', 'stated', 'connection', 'superiority', 'inferiority', 'leading', 'desintegration', 'group', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'seriously', 'injured', 'Willow', 'path', 'restart', 'love', 'life', 'potential', 'as', 'well', 'embrace', 'power', 'fears', 'Xander', 'importance', 'scoobies', 'finally', 'said', 'ability', 'see', 'what', 'others', 'do', 'maintain', 'unity', 'group', 'course', 'end', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'key', 'crisis', 'group', 'Spike', 'journey', 'will', 'be', 'understand', 'what', 'meand', 'have', 'soul', 'Then', 'are', 'who', 'return', 'Faith', 'Giles', 'new', 'principal', 'Wood', 'alliance', 'Buffy', 'will', 'be', 'somewhat', 'unstable', 'Spike', 'season', 'steady', 'pace', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'cherished', 'watching', 'many', 'episodes', 'can', 'one', 'other', 'structure', 'season', 'really', 'one', 'hooked', 'quality', 'episodes', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'single', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'usually', 'season', 'were', 'season', '6', 'was', 'made', 'love', '5', 'etc', 'extras', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'bloopers', 'are', 'funny', 'documentaries', 'are', 'clear', 'interesting', 'audio-commentaries', 'are', 'sometimes', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'surprise', 'commentary', 'Lessons', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'then', 'commentary', 'Dirty', 'Girls', 'writer', 'really', 'interesting', 'insights', 'way', 'structured', 'episode', 'way', 'men', 'objectivize', 'women', 'one', 'Chosen', 'J.', 'Whedon', 'excelent.The', 'finale', 'really', 'big', 'cinematic', 'dinamic', 'battle', 'supervamps', 'exciting', 'not', 'single', 'moment', 'boredom', 'Chosen', 'appart', 'return', 'Angel', 'character', 'never', 'liked', 'personal', 'so', 'forget', 'really', 'out', 'bang', 'then', 'collpasing', 'ground', 'then', 'big', 'crater-like', 'hole', 'earth']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season
849401,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0002XVKMC,Cubist,"[13, 15]","The last season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was a bittersweet affair. Sarah Michelle Gellar made it known that she had grown tired of playing Buffy and wanted to move on-presumably to motion pictures (which is exactly what she did with Scooby Doo 2 and The Grudge). And so, all bets were off as season seven began. Joss Whedon and company prepared to have Buffy and the Scooby gang face their biggest threat yet.The First is an interesting twist on the traditional Buffy bad guy in that it is not a physical threat per se (that comes later with Caleb) but a powerful psychological one as it appears to our heroes as friends or deceased loved ones to instill them with fear and self-doubt. As Giles puts it so well, it is ""the thing that created evil."" Of course, this shape-shifting entity gives Joss an opportunity to bring many of the show's significant characters back for one more go round (i.e. Joyce, Drusilla, etc.).Disc One features an audio commentary on ""Lessons"" by Joss Whedon and director David Solomon. Joss' trademark dry, sarcastic wit is evident as he and Solomon playfully make fun of each other.Disc Two includes an audio commentary on ""Selfless"" by director David Solomon and writer Drew Goddard. They talk about how this episode's emphasis was on Anya (Caulfield) and explores how she became a vengeance demon.There is also an audio commentary on ""Conversations with Dead People"" by director Nick Marck, writers Jane Epenson and Drew Goddard and actors Danny Strong and Tom Lenk. This is an entertaining track that fans will enjoy.Disc Three contains a featurette entitled, ""Buffy: It's Always Been About the Fans"" that examines the show's loyal fan base and how one site, in particular, hosts an annual, six-hour party for the cast and crew to celebrate the show.Disc Four contains an audio commentary on ""The Killer in Me"" with director David Solomon and writer Drew Z. Greenberg. This is kind of a dry, boring track as they joke and try to think of interesting things to say but end up narrating much of what we are seeing.Disc Five features an audio commentary on ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" by director David Fury, writer Drew Goddard and actors James Marsters and D.B. Woodside. This is a solid track thanks mostly to the presence of the actors who talk about their experiences working on the show and dealing with this Buffy mythology-rich episode.There is also an audio commentary on ""Dirty Girls"" by writer Drew Goddard and actor Nicholas Brendon. This isn't as entertaining a track as you would think but it is fairly decent.Disc Six contains the rest of the extra material, starting off with a fantastic audio commentary on the last episode, ""Chosen,"" by Joss Whedon. He talks about how exhausted he was by the time they made this episode. This is an oddly bittersweet track as Joss criticizes his own work with his amusing self-deprecating humour. It is also a very thoughtful commentary from the show's creator. A must-listen.""Season 7 Overview-Buffy: Full Circle"" takes a look at the season in general as cast and crew members talk about overriding themes. Not surprisingly, Joss says that this final season was about closure and bringing everything back to the beginning.""Buffy 101: Studying the Slayer"" features critics and scholars talking about the show's enduring legacy and ""the genius of the central concept,"" as one critic points out.""Generation S"" focuses on the young, potential slayers that Buffy trains to battle the First. The actors talk briefly about their characters and their experiences on the show.One of the strongest and most interesting extras in the set is ""The Last Sundown"" where Joss picks his ten favourite episodes from the show's entire run and why. This is a nice look back at the show's entire run with its creator.There is the obligatory ""Outtakes Reel"" of blown lines, pratfalls and general goofing around.Finally, there is ""Buffy Wraps,"" a look at the wrap party for the end of the show. You really get the impression that this show changed the lives of everyone who worked on it (and a lot of its fans too) and this is a fitting tribute to this fine program.",4,A fitting end to this great show...,1103155200,"12 16, 2004",2004,4126,"['last', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'was', 'bittersweet', 'affair', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'made', 'known', 'had', 'grown', 'tired', 'playing', 'Buffy', 'wanted', 'move', 'on-presumably', 'motion', 'pictures', 'exactly', 'what', 'did', 'Scooby', 'Doo', '2', 'Grudge', 'so', 'bets', 'were', 'off', 'season', 'seven', 'began', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'company', 'prepared', 'have', 'Buffy', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'face', 'biggest', 'threat', 'yet.The', 'First', 'interesting', 'twist', 'traditional', 'Buffy', 'bad', 'guy', 'not', 'physical', 'threat', 'se', 'later', 'Caleb', 'powerful', 'psychological', 'one', 'heroes', 'friends', 'deceased', 'loved', 'ones', 'instill', 'fear', 'self-doubt', 'Giles', 'so', 'well', 'thing', 'created', 'course', 'shape-shifting', 'entity', 'Joss', 'opportunity', 'bring', 'many', 'show', 'significant', 'characters', 'back', 'one', 'more', 'go', 'round', 'i.e', 'Joyce', 'Drusilla', 'etc', '.Disc', 'One', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Lessons', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'director', 'David', 'Solomon', 'Joss', 'trademark', 'dry', 'sarcastic', 'wit', 'evident', 'Solomon', 'playfully', 'make', 'fun', 'other.Disc', 'Two', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Selfless', 'director', 'David', 'Solomon', 'writer', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'talk', 'how', 'episode', 'emphasis', 'was', 'Anya', 'Caulfield', 'how', 'became', 'vengeance', 'demon.There', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Conversations', 'Dead', 'People', 'director', 'Nick', 'Marck', 'writers', 'Jane', 'Epenson', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'actors', 'Danny', 'Strong', 'Tom', 'Lenk', 'entertaining', 'track', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy.Disc', 'Three', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Buffy', 'Always', 'Been', 'Fans', 'show', 'loyal', 'fan', 'base', 'how', 'one', 'site', 'particular', 'annual', 'six-hour', 'party', 'cast', 'crew', 'celebrate', 'show.Disc', 'Four', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Killer', 'Me', 'director', 'David', 'Solomon', 'writer', 'Drew', 'Z.', 'Greenberg', 'kind', 'dry', 'boring', 'track', 'joke', 'try', 'think', 'interesting', 'things', 'say', 'end', 'up', 'narrating', 'much', 'what', 'are', 'seeing.Disc', 'Five', 'features', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Lies', 'My', 'Parents', 'Told', 'Me', 'director', 'David', 'Fury', 'writer', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'actors', 'James', 'Marsters', 'D.B', 'Woodside', 'solid', 'track', 'thanks', 'mostly', 'presence', 'actors', 'who', 'talk', 'experiences', 'working', 'show', 'dealing', 'Buffy', 'mythology-rich', 'episode.There', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Dirty', 'Girls', 'writer', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'actor', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'track', 'would', 'think', 'fairly', 'decent.Disc', 'Six', 'rest', 'extra', 'material', 'starting', 'off', 'fantastic', 'audio', 'commentary', 'last', 'episode', 'Chosen', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'how', 'exhausted', 'was', 'time', 'made', 'episode', 'oddly', 'bittersweet', 'track', 'Joss', 'own', 'work', 'amusing', 'self-deprecating', 'humour', 'also', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'commentary', 'show', 'creator', 'must-listen', 'Season', '7', 'Overview-Buffy', 'Full', 'Circle', 'look', 'season', 'general', 'cast', 'crew', 'members', 'talk', 'overriding', 'themes', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Joss', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'closure', 'bringing', 'everything', 'back', 'beginning', 'Buffy', '101', 'Studying', 'Slayer', 'critics', 'scholars', 'talking', 'show', 'enduring', 'legacy', 'genius', 'central', 'concept', 'one', 'critic', 'points', 'out', 'Generation', 'S', 'young', 'potential', 'slayers', 'Buffy', 'battle', 'First', 'actors', 'talk', 'briefly', 'characters', 'experiences', 'show.One', 'strongest', 'most', 'interesting', 'extras', 'set', 'Last', 'Sundown', 'where', 'Joss', 'ten', 'favourite', 'episodes', 'show', 'entire', 'run', 'why', 'nice', 'look', 'back', 'show', 'entire', 'run', 'creator.There', 'obligatory', 'Outtakes', 'Reel', 'blown', 'lines', 'pratfalls', 'general', 'goofing', 'around.Finally', 'Buffy', 'Wraps', 'look', 'wrap', 'party', 'end', 'show', 'really', 'get', 'impression', 'show', 'changed', 'lives', 'everyone', 'who', 'worked', 'lot', 'fans', 'too', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'fine', 'program']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

849404,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B0002XVKMC,D. Mok,"[5, 9]","Seven seasons.  Sarah Michelle Gellar had been 19 when she did the first season.  Alyson Hannigan was just shy of 30 years old in Season 7, and Nicholas Brendon was well past that.After this long, you have to give Joss Whedon and his team of writers a lot of credit that there are so many good bits in Season 7 of this show.  At the same time, problems which have nagged at the series since Season 3 once again show up to the party.When I began to watch this season, I was blown away by the first several episodes.  The invisibility conceit of ""Same Time, Same Place"" has been used a couple of times, but its exploration of Willow's post-witchcraft character -- and Michelle Trachtenberg's hilarious ""paralyzed Dawn"" turn -- are new.  ""Help"" has appealing performances from Sarah Michelle Gellar and Azura Skye (so much that they brought Skye's character back later), ""Selfless"" gives the great Emma Caulfield a chance to strut her stuff, and James Marsters brilliantly burns through punk-vampire Spike's shift from insanity to sensitivity.  DB Woodside also offers some great diversity -- both emotional and ethnic -- as the calm, dryly humorous Principal Wood, whose allegiance is a mystery for half the season.Too bad that as the season progressed and the central narrative arc started kicking in, the pacing began to drag.  This has always happened with the show since Season 4, and the show Angel was also prone to this.  At a certain point, the main villain of the first half of Act 2 has to bow out, leaving the writers struggling to kick the show into low gear and raise it back up.  The ""Potentials"" are a marvellous idea, spearheaded by the lovably feisty Iyari Limon as firebrand Kennedy and adorable weirdo Sarah Hagan (Freaks and Geeks) as mousy girl-genius Amanda, but there are so many new ""Potentials"" that at a certain point the main staging area became a cacophony of voices, lines and characters.  And for a show that's always done quite well on racial diversity, I was grossly disappointed that they would include an Asian stereotype, Chao-Ahn (played by an actress whose Cantonese is utterly mangled), that verges on Charlie Chan territory.  The character of Andrew also gets a lot of attention, but he's the same joke played over and over far too many times, and serves mostly to bog down the action; actor Tom Lenk seems to copy some of Alyson Hannigan's mannerisms and verbal rhythms, but without the perfect comic timing and naturalistic quirkiness.The roles of Willow and Xander have diminished, possibly because of the huge number of new and supporting characters.  And final villain Caleb, a misogynistic southern preacher, is one of the most insufferably long-winded characters in the show's history.  Also, at this point, I was disappointed in the lack of creativity in the character.  How many ""superhuman strength, invulnerable"" villains have we had already?  Just off the top of my head we have Luke (Season 1), Kakistos (Season 3), Adam (Season 4), Glory (Season 5), powered-up Willow (Season 6), the Uebervampire (Season 7, Act 2), and now Caleb.  Clare Kramer's way with comical dialogue elevated Glory, but when Caleb did the ol' ""punch Buffy through the air"", I felt like I was watching something I'd seen a hundred times on this show.  Wish they'd come up with more villains like The Judge or Gwendolen Post, who don't rely on brute force and immunity to punches.  For the role of the final villain, this is especially tired, after we've already seen Glory in action.The final third of the season picks back up with the re-emergence of Faith.  Eliza Dushku is never less than great, and the character's party-hearty bravura helps lift the overly heavy tone that this show always falls into near the end of a season.  Faith's character worked even better in Season 4 of Angel, but she remains electrifying.  Buffy's character once again drifts into self-righteousness and an overdose of malaise midway through, and for a long time I've considered her the least interesting member of the main cast.  Too much crying and lamenting, not enough comedy and eccentricity.  In keeping with the heavy tone, the level of violence in this season is a bit much.  For once I have to agree with the parent groups:  Since when have characters hacked in half (however brief, during the final swordfight) and thumbs in eye sockets been TV material?  On one hand, you could call it pushing the envelope; on the other, you could ask why they had to resort to blood and guts.I won't agree with people who say this show fizzled out.  The finale is quite spectacular, with not one but two losses in the core group, and the ""mutiny"" which preceeds the ending is exactly what the show needed, splintering the main characters and progressing their relationships right before the end.  I don't consider this the weakest season (for me, Seasons 4 and 6 are pretty problematic as well); I'd say that if you're new to the show, this isn't the place to start, but if you've been watching for awhile, this season will be mostly satisfying, and a longtime fan is going to forgive the shortcomings, more likely than not.",4,Slamming opening and ending; weak middle.,1100822400,"11 19,

It is the worst, including the first season in which the show had not truly yet found its voice. (And fellow Buffy fans, before you blast me, keep in mind that *some* season has to be the worst one. ;)And yet, I still rate it (and with no qualms) 5 Stars, for that is what it deserves. That should give you some idea of the quality of the show, entire.Specifically as regards the Seventh Season, it has a few great episodes (Selfless, Conversations with Dead People, Storyteller and the grand finale, Chosen) and a few which go awry (though Him is way underrated). The problems of the Seventh Season mainly occur in the last quarter, and they seem to stem from the fact that the production team learned of the series' impending end a little too late to prepare for it adequately. And so, we have some too-convenient plot devices (like the 'Scythe' and Guardian) and some elements ignored all-together (Buffy won't choose Dawn, huh?). Some of the later episodes, like Empty Places, seem to be just killing time.And yet the show never loses its wonderful characters, acting, writing, directing or dialogue. And the ending does truly befit a show that has been 5 Star all the way. It is majestic, sweeping, fitting, touching, triumphant, heroic.Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the greatest television show of all time. Read my reviews of each season, if you'd like.

Let me list the ways in which this season sucked.  First of all, my absolute favorite character, Willow, started off in a direction that was pleasing to me, but the writers decided that they HAD to have her in a relationship, so they stuck her with Kennedy, who was by the way, one of the worst characters and actresses put on this series.Bringing back Faith was a brilliant idea, yet it was poorly executed (unlike in the 4th season of Angel where she excelled).  The actress had nothing to work with, and I felt she was left ""in limbo""....never really making a dent in the storyline.Xander became a shadow of his former self, not to mention how boring Giles was!  When Xander's eye got squashed, I shrugged my shoulders, not really caring for him at this point.  What a whiney queen he became!  A little too self-righteous for my tastes.Anya character became the one person in this season who I liked, especially in the episode where she decimated the entire frat house.  Unfortunately, her redemption was muted by the fact that she was sliced in half.  They never really did explain TO MY SATISFACTION, why Xander broke up with her.  It never made any sense given how close they were to begin with (remember episode where he comments to her how she ""makes him feel like something no one else has made him feel.....like a man"".and now to the mythology portion of my dislike.  The Big Bad started off pretty good, but was killed so conveniently by a scythe out of NOWHERE in the last couple episodes.  And although Angel was finally brought back into the series, his part was nothing more than window dressing.  He may as well have been a mannequin.There were only a few good episodes in this, but nothing to justify 22 episodes worth of storyline.  What a shame.  As much as I loved Season 6, I think they were better off to end the series at 5.",2,Bad Season.

849415,A2X27FQSHP418Y,B0002XVKMC,Gergellor,"[4, 10]","But even an average season of Buffy is better than most of the shows on television ever. So, I think there are so factors that made me give it only three stars:1) First of all, Kennedy is annoying. Unbearable. One of the worst characters ever to feature in the show. She can't even come close to Tara. Each line, each second on screen with her made me want to turn off the TV / DVD;2) Ok, with that out of my chest, I can go on. Knowing that show would end, maybe the producers thought it would be a good idea to make the fans dislike Buffy's character, so they would not miss her once the show was over! Because Buffy becomes sometimes very, VERY annoying in Season 7.3) I don't know what was Nicolas Brendon's reaction when he began reading the scripts for season 7. He must have tought: ""Where the hell am I?"". Yes, because Xander is practically erased from the history, along with Dawn, Anya, Giles and even Willow in the first episodes. Our beloved Scoobie Gang is given a less than just treatment in the last season. Their screen time was virtually eradicated due to that infinite number of Potentials. Ok, the POtentials were the plausible reason to explain that Buffy would not need to be the Chosen One forever (or until she died), but the Potentials were lame, lame, lame. I never cared for any one of them, even for the ones who died.4) The death of Anya. My God, Emma Caulfied must have done something wrong to the producers. How can such a charismatic and sweet character be killed in such a brief way, with no drama,no tears being drawn by her friends, nothing? By the way, as someone below wrote, by season's end it seems all Scoobie Gang had became worse people, instead of better people!! As if it was possible, sometime along the season some of the magic empathy and love the audience had learned to share with these characters seemed to vanish!!5) Plot holes and suspense of credulity were always fundamental characteristics of the show, so I was used to it. But this season reached an all time low in this category.... How can a city be evacuated, and no authority says anything? Where is the media? Where is State police, Federal police, the Army, where is anyone who would check why the entire population of a city is leaving it?!!!6)Good points: the return of Faith; Spike (as always); Principal Wood. It's amazing (even due to forces beyond his control) how Spike in a frenzied access of carnage killed more than a dozen people in small Sunnydale!! It seems Joss made that things on purpose, justo to annoy us. Once we began to feel ""relieved"" that Spike had a soul, that he would once and for all be a faithful member of the Scoobies, he made him kill (I repeat) dozen of people, and bury them, acting like the most insane and sadistic serial killer! And Buffy doesn't care the leat for the victims, the families of the victims or whatever. All she cares about is Spike. This brings me a funny question: all these murders would be classified as ""NOT SOLVED"" forever in the Police files?All in all, I think this is one of the greatest shows ever, but I think Joss Whedon's arrogance won at the end and, guyided by the need to ""innovate"" always, he made stupid decisions a lot of times, to the point that I felt happy that the show ended before my dissapointment grew...",3,"Very good season, but not the best.",1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,3293,"['even', 'average', 'season', 'Buffy', 'better', 'most', 'shows', 'television', 'ever', 'So', 'think', 'are', 'so', 'factors', 'made', 'give', 'only', 'three', 'stars:1', 'First', 'Kennedy', 'annoying', 'Unbearable', 'One', 'worst', 'characters', 'ever', 'feature', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Tara', 'line', 'second', 'screen', 'made', 'want', 'turn', 'off', 'TV', '/', 'DVD', '2', 'Ok', 'chest', 'can', 'go', 'Knowing', 'show', 'would', 'end', 'maybe', 'producers', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'make', 'fans', 'dislike', 'Buffy', 'character', 'would', 'not', 'miss', 'once', 'show', 'was', 'over', 'Buffy', 'sometimes', 'very', 'VERY', 'annoying', 'Season', '7.3', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'Nicolas', 'Brendon', 'reaction', 'when', 'began', 'reading', 'scripts', 'season', '7', 'must', 'have', 'tought', 'Where', 'hell', 'am', 'Yes', 'Xander', 'practically', 'erased', 'history', 'Dawn', 'Anya', 'Giles', 'even', 'Willow', 'first', 'episodes', 'beloved', 'Scoobie', 'Gang', 'given', 'less', 'just', 'treatment', 'last', 'season', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'virtually', 'eradicated', 'due', 'infinite', 'number', 'Potentials', 'Ok', 'POtentials', 'were', 'plausible', 'reason', 'explain', 'Buffy', 'would', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'Chosen', 'One', 'forever', 'died', 'Potentials', 'were', 'lame', 'lame', 'lame', 'never', 'cared', 'one', 'even', 'ones', 'who', 'died.4', 'death', 'Anya', 'My', 'God', 'Emma', 'Caulfied', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'wrong', 'producers', 'How', 'can', 'such', 'charismatic', 'sweet', 'character', 'be', 'killed', 'such', 'brief', 'way', 'drama', 'tears', 'being', 'drawn', 'friends', 'nothing', 'way', 'someone', 'wrote', 'season', 'end', 'Scoobie', 'Gang', 'had', 'became', 'worse', 'people', 'instead', 'better', 'people', 'was', 'possible', 'sometime', 'season', 'magic', 'empathy', 'love', 'audience', 'had', 'learned', 'share', 'characters', 'seemed', 'vanish', '5', 'Plot', 'holes', 'suspense', 'credulity', 'were', 'always', 'fundamental', 'characteristics', 'show', 'was', 'used', 'season', 'reached', 'time', 'low', 'category', 'How', 'can', 'city', 'be', 'evacuated', 'authority', 'anything', 'Where', 'media', 'Where', 'State', 'police', 'Federal', 'police', 'Army', 'where', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'check', 'why', 'entire', 'population', 'city', 'leaving', '6', 'Good', 'points', 'return', 'Faith', 'Spike', 'always', 'Principal', 'Wood', 'amazing', 'even', 'due', 'forces', 'control', 'how', 'Spike', 'frenzied', 'access', 'carnage', 'killed', 'more', 'dozen', 'people', 'small', 'Sunnydale', 'Joss', 'made', 'things', 'purpose', 'justo', 'annoy', 'began', 'feel', 'relieved', 'Spike', 'had', 'soul', 'would', 'once', 'be', 'faithful', 'member', 'Scoobies', 'made', 'kill', 'repeat', 'dozen', 'people', 'bury', 'acting', 'most', 'insane', 'sadistic', 'serial', 'killer', 'Buffy', ""n't"", 'care', 'leat', 'victims', 'families', 'victims', 'about', 'Spike', 'funny', 'question', 'murders', 'would', 'be', 'classified', 'NOT', 'SOLVED', 'forever', 'Police', 'files', 'think', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'ever', 'think', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'arrogance', 'won', 'end', 'guyided', 'need', 'innovate', 'always', 'made', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'lot', 'times', 'point', 'felt', 'happy', 'show', 'ended', 'dissapointment', 'grew']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

Once you see the context and direction Joss was going, some of the apparently annoying plot developments fall into place (yep, including those irritating ""potentials"").  This season showcases one of the great ensembles of television history, comfortable in their craft and characters. As ever with Buffy the show is able to deliver humor and tragedy in a heartbeat, usually understated, often very clever.The season repays fans with quite a lot of self-referential material.  As stated by others, it lifts from the darkness of season 6, which was also a strong season IMO, for other reasons.  SMG brings us back to a Buffy dealing fully with her role as a slayer, very strongly supported by Allyson, Eliza and a powerful role for future captain brownpants, Nathon Fillon. Andrew, whilst again irritating at first, becomes a comic highlight as the season goes on, his scenes with Spike and Anya are classic comedy, nicely balancing the darker developments elsewhere.Yes, Spike features a lot, so perhaps the anti-Spike crowd (?) are going to have less to cheer about.  But even those incomprehensible types should appreciate what Joss is doing with the Buffy-Spike relationship.  It's no longer about lust, it was never about love, but it just might be about trust.Hey, it's a great finish to a series so many of us wish had gone on even longer.

849419,A1H8JUI9GNQKNR,B0002XVKMC,Harold Harefoot,"[5, 7]","Buffy's seventh season is much better viewing on dvd than when it was originally broadcast.  As with season four of Angel, most of the action this season happens over a very short period of time, in terms of the show's chronology.  The original broadcast was difficult to watch because action on the show that occurred on consecutive days was often separated by weeks of waiting for the next episode to be broadcast.  The dvds solve that problem by allowing you to view the episodes over a short period of time, as they are meant to be shown.  When viewed this way, many of what some people see as inconsistencies in the story disappear.  Indeed, with the exception of one episode that doesn't fit in so well (which I won't name - you can figure it out yourself - although it makes a great comedy stand-alone episode), this season plays like a very exciting 22 hour movie.  However, besides that, it also brilliantly incorporates and concludes the overarching story of the whole series.  This season has some of the best in-jokes of the entire seven season run of the show, including some very obscure references that really make you think.  One of the most hilarious is in a later episode where Giles (who claims not to be trying to get Spike killed) sends Spike to a Mission in Gilroy, California.  If you don't understand the joke, just look Gilroy up on the internet and see what the town is most well known for.  The whole season is full of imaginative material like that.  The finale, ""Chosen"", completely blew me away.  For seven years it was drilled into our heads - ""... one girl in all the world.  She alone can fight the vampires...""  Anyone who says they were expecting the ending that Joss gave us is lying.  Joss, as always, gave us something completely shocking and unexpected to end the show.

849420,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0002XVKMC,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[41, 43]","From 1997 to 2003, Joss Whedon gave his audience some of the best episodes aired on television. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER showcased an empowered young girl saddled with the unintimidating name of Buffy Summers, who, with the help of her high school friends and her stuffy mentor Giles, faced sundry monsters and saved the world - a lot. Along the way, she managed to leave an indelible impact on our pop cultural consciousness.Before its series debut, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, based on its promotional push on TV, seemed slated to be a straight-out horror series starring an erstwhile typical high schooler who battles vampires and demons. But, fairly quickly on, this unassuming little show, thanks to Whedon's intense and witty, pop-culture savvy yet very literate writing, met and surpassed the viewer's expectations. Whedon created compelling stories and characters who grew on the viewers; for seven years, we watched them strive to maintain a normal life as they navigated thru high school, college life, and then to adulthood, all the while frequently facing down supernatural threats. Which brings us to Season 7.Possible SPOILERS follow: Here in the bittersweet and melancholy finale season, Joss Whedon attempts to provide closure to the show and also to bring it full circle to its origins. The opening episode ""Lessons"" has Buffy escorting Dawn, for her inaugural school day, back to good, ol' Sunnydale High, which has just been rebuilt on top of the old one. This, by the way, means that the Hellmouth is very much alive and again active. Somehow, Buffy is offered a job as a school counselor at Sunnydale High by the enigmatic principal, Robin Wood (24's D.B. Woodside). Back in England, Willow, under the tutelage of Giles and a benevolent coven of witches, has been recovering from her turn to the dark side (Season Six) and receives a horrifying glimpse of the future for Sunnydale. Meanwhile, Spike is found dwelling in the Sunnydale High School basement in a bonkers state of mind, influenced by his new soul and possibly also by...something else. Lessee, who's left? Anya is again a Vengeance Demon, though her heart isn't really in it. And Xander is still fixing windows...The season's major story arc involves the return of the First Evil, the original and the source of all evil. The First's return is made possible by the instability caused by Buffy's having died and consequently being resurrected (again, Season 6). Very early on, we get a hint of the season's Big Bad as various Sunnydale denizens spout the ominous warning: ""From beneath you, it devours."" This season also increases the scope of Buffy's world even more as most of the Watcher Council are annihilated and Giles is forced to seek out Potential Slayers (who are also being killed off one by one by Bringers, no-eyed, murdering servants of Caleb and the First) and bring them to Sunnydale for protection. Now, more than ever, Buffy's leadership skills and methods are tested and even questioned as several of the Potentials prove to be uncowed and contentious free thinkers. Buffy has never been forced to deliver as many bracing, rallying speeches as she has been this season, which attests to her foe's overwhelming level of menace.Because the First cannot enter our world in a corporeal form and can only assume the identities of dead people, this is an opportunity for a callback of Buffy's past uber-foes. For one last time, we get to enjoy cameos of the Master, Drusilla, the Mayor, Adam, Glory, and two of the Nerd Trio. Pretty neat. Besides the First, Buffy faces two despicable and truly hard-to-kill villains, who are themselves minions of the First: the Turok-Han, an early caveman type of vampire (thus, even more sturdy than contemporary vampires) and Caleb, the frightening, mysoginistic preacher who convincingly beats Buffy senseless in several encounters.As ever, the writers do an amazing job. The episodes are obviously action-packed. But, underneath the surface, the show is laden with metaphors and symbolisms. Themes of isolation, the isolation of a leader, female empowerment, sacrifice, friendship, and humanity are touched on in great depth. This season is also about the quest for redemption. Most of the members of Buffy's Scooby gang, ironically, at one point or another, were evil or have turned evil in the past: Willow, Spike, Anya, Faith, Andrew...All these characters are trying to find their way back to atonement; it won't be easy.This season has to be the one with the most recurring characters in it. Principal Wood and the Potentials are introduced. Season 7 also marks the return of Andrew, Faith, and, in one episode, Angel. With the glut of additional characters, the core Scoobies are given short thrift here, although Dawn does shine in ""Potential"" and Xander proves his worth in ""Potential"" and ""Dirty Girls."" One episode, ""Selfless,"" really focuses on Anya and paves the way for her eventual return to the fold. Only Spike seems to maintain copious screen time throughout the series. The camera, of course, is ever on Buffy Summers.The arrival of the Potentials does usher in a freshness to the series as it simultaneously takes the spotlight away from the Scoobies. The take-charge Kennedy (Iyari Limon), the feisty Rona (Indigo), and Amanda (Sarah Hagan) prove to be welcome additions to the cast, while the non-English speaking Asian Potential drops some instant funnies. ""Conversations with Dead People"" reintroduces Andrew (the very good, very funny Tom Lenk) as a possible good guy, while ""Dirty Girls"" marks the welcome return of sexy Faith (Eliza Dushku) as her encounters with Spike provide some of the high points of the season. The awesome Nathan Fillion, by the way, is scary good as Caleb.The Special Features provide episode commentaries by various cast and crew members on ""Lessons,"" ""Selfless,"" ""Conversations with Dead People,"" ""The Killer In Me,"" ""Lies My Parents Told Me,"" ""Dirty Girls,"" and ""Chosen."" Disc 3 has the featurette ""It's Always Been About the Fans."" Disc 6 offers up four more featurettes (the 36-minute long ""Season 7 Overview - Buffy: Full Circle""; ""Buffy 101- Studying the Slayer"" - various television critics talk about the show's influence; ""Generation S"" - interviews with the Potentials actresses; ""The Last Sundown"" - a look at Joss Whedon's top 10 favorite Buffy episodes and some of his thoughts about the series); an outtakes reel (not that funny); ""Buffy Wraps"" (the wrap party with cast and crew, but where was Sarah Michelle Gellar?); and for those who care, a DVD-ROM Willow Demon Guide.Years ago, Joss Whedon wanted to shake things up by turning topsy-turvy the cliche of the hapless, little blonde damsel needing a hero to come to her rescue. Seven years of quality television has proven that audiences will accept a tiny girl being capable of slaying monsters while remaining quintessentially feminine. So, above all else, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is meant to be a feminist allegory. But, for those who aren't into that, there's still so much that this season has to offer: an us against the world mentality, superlative action sequences, shivery horror/fantasy elements, witty repartees, heartfelt dialogue, gripping, dramatic stories, and great acting. And, of course, great, iconic heroes in Buffy Summers, Spike, Faith, and crew.

849423,A1XO58KR12PC91,B0002XVKMC,"Iqbal Faizer ""Muldfeld""","[17, 26]","I cannot review the DVD, since it hasn't been released yet, but I can evaluate this season's story.  In short, this is the second-worst season of Buffy, after the not entirely funny first season.  After the spectacular sixth season, this season was planned from the start as the show's final one, but, oddly enough, felt incredibly ill-planned and nonsensical right up to the final moment.  The finale, in particular, seemed so rushed, as to not fully live up to the spirit of the show or give the characters their due.  The main characters, aside from Buffy and Spike, seemed to receive an undeserved lack of attention, especially Anya, Xander, and Giles.The execution of the plot about the potential slayers -- about which I won't go into detail for those who haven't seen the season -- was very poorly done, especially with regard to dialogue.  Far too much significance was given and focus directed toward characters who were introduced this season -- even more than toward those regular characters who appear in the main credits.  This was a huge loss.  Chacters like Xander, Giles and Anya were what made me interested in the show, and their downright misuse and superficial involvement seems foolish and lacking in consideration for the fans, who invested so much emotional interest in them.There are exceptions to this silly main plot.  The beginning of the season is quite strong with an episode focussed on Anya that is one of the best of the season.  ""Conversations with Dead People"" is strong, and ""Potential"" provides some interesting final moments between Dawn and Xander that make you forget how irritating Dawn can be, but only highlight how wonderful and underexplored Xander was this year.Overall, if you are interested in the Angel series, which had a fantastic final year and excellent finale, this season is essential to understanding Spike, as so much of the story focusses on him.  I am even going to buy this DVD set.  However, understand that the show has lost much of what made it special:  the fun and brilliant interlacing of humor and drama that made overrated shows like ""Friends"" look, well, severely overrated.  Instead of forging into the show's swan song with a formula that worked, the writers mistakenly believed that the show's dull action scenes and foreboding were its strongest suits, and that, in X-Files-ian fashion, realism meant that our beloved characters wouldn't joke in serious times.  While this might be alright for a few episodes, it becomes intensely draining and even boring by midway through the season.  Suspense and heavily-serious drama were never Buffy's stronger aspects.  What made it more fun than so many paranormal or sci-fi shows was its willingness to make light of situations.  The writers had lost their ability or desire to do this, and the show suffered.  More importantly, unlike the fascinating drama between Buffy and Angel in Season 2, Faith and Buffy in Season 3, and essentially everyone in seasons 2 through 6, this -- the final season of Buffy -- simply lacked an interesting set of tensions and character arcs.  When Joss Whedon's plotting lost the essential wit and humor that made the show so amusing, and then left viewers with just plain cheesy and bad drama, how can he have thought his efforts would amount to more than 2.5 stars, especially when Season 5 was worth 5 stars.",2,Non-DVD review:  characters lost sense of humor.,1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,3358,"['can', 'not', 'review', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'yet', 'can', 'evaluate', 'season', 'story', 'short', 'second-worst', 'season', 'Buffy', 'not', 'entirely', 'funny', 'first', 'season', 'spectacular', 'sixth', 'season', 'season', 'was', 'planned', 'start', 'show', 'final', 'one', 'oddly', 'enough', 'felt', 'incredibly', 'ill-planned', 'nonsensical', 'right', 'up', 'final', 'moment', 'finale', 'particular', 'seemed', 'so', 'rushed', 'not', 'fully', 'live', 'up', 'spirit', 'show', 'give', 'characters', 'due', 'main', 'characters', 'aside', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'seemed', 'receive', 'undeserved', 'lack', 'attention', 'especially', 'Anya', 'Xander', 'Giles.The', 'execution', 'plot', 'potential', 'slayers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'poorly', 'done', 'especially', 'regard', 'dialogue', 'Far', 'too', 'much', 'significance', 'was', 'given', 'focus', 'directed', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'introduced', 'season', 'even', 'more', 'regular', 'characters', 'who', 'appear', 'main', 'credits', 'was', 'huge', 'loss', 'Chacters', 'Xander', 'Giles', 'Anya', 'were', 'what', 'made', 'interested', 'show', 'downright', 'misuse', 'superficial', 'involvement', 'foolish', 'lacking', 'consideration', 'fans', 'who', 'invested', 'so', 'much', 'emotional', 'interest', 'are', 'exceptions', 'silly', 'main', 'plot', 'beginning', 'season', 'quite', 'strong', 'episode', 'focussed', 'Anya', 'one', 'best', 'season', 'Conversations', 'Dead', 'People', 'strong', 'Potential', 'interesting', 'final', 'moments', 'Dawn', 'Xander', 'make', 'forget', 'how', 'irritating', 'Dawn', 'can', 'be', 'only', 'highlight', 'how', 'wonderful', 'underexplored', 'Xander', 'was', 'year.Overall', 'are', 'interested', 'Angel', 'series', 'had', 'fantastic', 'final', 'year', 'excellent', 'finale', 'season', 'essential', 'understanding', 'Spike', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'focusses', 'am', 'even', 'going', 'buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'However', 'understand', 'show', 'lost', 'much', 'what', 'made', 'special', 'fun', 'brilliant', 'interlacing', 'humor', 'drama', 'made', 'overrated', 'shows', 'Friends', 'look', 'well', 'severely', 'overrated', 'Instead', 'forging', 'show', 'swan', 'song', 'formula', 'worked', 'writers', 'mistakenly', 'believed', 'show', 'dull', 'action', 'scenes', 'foreboding', 'were', 'strongest', 'suits', 'X-Files-ian', 'fashion', 'realism', 'meant', 'beloved', 'characters', 'would', ""n't"", 'joke', 'serious', 'times', 'might', 'be', 'alright', 'few', 'episodes', 'intensely', 'draining', 'even', 'boring', 'midway', 'season', 'Suspense', 'heavily-serious', 'drama', 'were', 'never', 'Buffy', 'stronger', 'aspects', 'What', 'made', 'more', 'fun', 'so', 'many', 'paranormal', 'sci-fi', 'shows', 'was', 'willingness', 'make', 'light', 'situations', 'writers', 'had', 'lost', 'ability', 'desire', 'do', 'show', 'suffered', 'More', 'importantly', 'fascinating', 'drama', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Season', '2', 'Faith', 'Buffy', 'Season', '3', 'essentially', 'everyone', 'seasons', '2', '6', 'final', 'season', 'Buffy', 'simply', 'lacked', 'interesting', 'set', 'tensions', 'character', 'arcs', 'When', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'plotting', 'lost', 'essential', 'wit', 'humor', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'amusing', 'then', 'left', 'viewers', 'just', 'plain', 'cheesy', 'bad', 'drama', 'how', 'can', 'have', 'thought', 'efforts', 'would', 'amount', 'more', '2.5', 'stars', 'especially', 'when', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'worth', '5', 'stars']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

However, there a few key points I want to address.After I watched the cliffhanger ending of season 6, I had to watch season 7.  I mean, Spike with a soul?  How could it not be awesome.  Here's how.  Spike doesn't act any different.  He's a little nutty when he first gets back to Sunnydale, but it didn't really make any sense.  Angel didn't act like that when he got his soul back.  He was very remorseful, but he didn't  just sit around spouting gibberish.  And once Spike gets over himself, he's no different from the Spike we knew in the last 3 seasons.  I never really thought of Spike as evil, necessarily.  Maybe a little bit in the first half of Season 2, but he had already pretty much turned good before he got his soul back.  He was still kind of a jerk, and that should have changed with him getting his soul back.  I mean, look at Angel.  He did a complete 180 when he got a soul.  Spike has pretty much the same personality with and without a soul.Now, the main villian of this season, The First.  Remember them?  Those ghost guys who started tormenting Angel around Christmas in season 3?  Well, the writers decided to make them the big bad of this season.  They suddenly show up and decide to destroy the world.  So where were they for the last 4 years?  And who are they?  How did they create the vampires-on-steroids if they can't physically manifest themselves?  What happened to them at the end?  Did they get blown up along with the hellmouth?  Are they somehow linked to the hellmouth?  WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?!?I want to bring up one more point.  The character Dawn.  She turned into an excellent character in this season.  I mean, she finally grows up and stops being such a brat.  That is, until the end.  That thing where she and the other slayers kick Buffy out of the house was the stupidest, most contrived, pointless plot line I've ever seen.  It makes no sense, it makes you want to kill Dawn even more, and Buffy is back with them at the end of the next episode.  What did you do guys do that for?!  I want to point out all the annoying characters in the later half of this series.  Riley.  They removed him when there was a fan outcry for it.  Tara.  Her bland character was finally killed off.  Anya.  She finally dies at the end of this season.  But Dawn?  She stays on for the rest of the series.  She's even in the season 8 comics.  I want to compare Dawn to Connor on Angel.  Both of them are easily the worst, most hated characters on their respective shows.  The difference?  On Angel, they had the good sense to remove Connor after one season.  Why not on Buffy?  I mean, Joss Whedon was overseeing both shows.  In fact, I want to ask another question.  If Joss Whedon was the creator of both shows, and he oversaw both shows, then why was Angel so good, and Buffy seasons 4, 5, and 7 so awful?",1,A horrible end to a once great series,1256860800,"10 30, 2009",2009,3232,"['have', 'say', 'season', 'was', 'just', 'piece', 'garbage', 'plot', 'characters', 'villians', 'Buffy', 'long-winded', 'uninspiring', 'speeches', 'annoying', 'slayers-in-training', 'horrible', 'looking', 'CGI-fueled', 'action', 'scenes', 'crappy', 'end', 'once-great', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'want', 'do', 'in-depth', 'review', 'season', '7', 'did', 'other', 'seasons', 'However', 'few', 'key', 'points', 'want', 'address.After', 'watched', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'season', '6', 'had', 'watch', 'season', '7', 'mean', 'Spike', 'soul', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'awesome', 'Here', 'how', 'Spike', ""n't"", 'act', 'different', 'little', 'nutty', 'when', 'first', 'back', 'Sunnydale', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'Angel', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'when', 'got', 'soul', 'back', 'was', 'very', 'remorseful', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'sit', 'around', 'spouting', 'gibberish', 'once', 'Spike', 'different', 'Spike', 'knew', 'last', '3', 'seasons', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'Spike', 'evil', 'necessarily', 'Maybe', 'little', 'bit', 'first', 'half', 'Season', '2', 'had', 'already', 'pretty', 'much', 'turned', 'good', 'got', 'soul', 'back', 'was', 'still', 'kind', 'jerk', 'should', 'have', 'changed', 'getting', 'soul', 'back', 'mean', 'look', 'Angel', 'did', 'complete', '180', 'when', 'got', 'soul', 'Spike', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'personality', 'soul.Now', 'main', 'villian', 'season', 'First', 'Remember', 'ghost', 'guys', 'who', 'started', 'tormenting', 'Angel', 'Christmas', 'season', '3', 'Well', 'writers', 'decided', 'make', 'big', 'bad', 'season', 'suddenly', 'show', 'up', 'decide', 'destroy', 'world', 'where', 'were', 'last', '4', 'years', 'who', 'are', 'How', 'did', 'create', 'vampires-on-steroids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'physically', 'manifest', 'What', 'happened', 'end', 'Did', 'get', 'blown', 'up', 'hellmouth', 'Are', 'somehow', 'linked', 'hellmouth', 'WHAT', 'HECK', 'IS', 'GOING', 'ON', 'want', 'bring', 'up', 'one', 'more', 'point', 'character', 'Dawn', 'turned', 'excellent', 'character', 'season', 'mean', 'finally', 'up', 'stops', 'being', 'such', 'brat', 'end', 'thing', 'where', 'other', 'slayers', 'kick', 'Buffy', 'house', 'was', 'stupidest', 'most', 'contrived', 'pointless', 'plot', 'line', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'sense', 'want', 'kill', 'Dawn', 'even', 'more', 'Buffy', 'back', 'end', 'next', 'episode', 'What', 'did', 'do', 'guys', 'do', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'annoying', 'characters', 'later', 'half', 'series', 'Riley', 'removed', 'when', 'was', 'fan', 'outcry', 'Tara', 'bland', 'character', 'was', 'finally', 'killed', 'off', 'Anya', 'finally', 'end', 'season', 'Dawn', 'rest', 'series', 'even', 'season', '8', 'comics', 'want', 'compare', 'Dawn', 'Connor', 'Angel', 'are', 'easily', 'worst', 'most', 'hated', 'characters', 'respective', 'shows', 'difference', 'Angel', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'remove', 'Connor', 'one', 'season', 'Why', 'not', 'Buffy', 'mean', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'was', 'overseeing', 'shows', 'fact', 'want', 'ask', 'question', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'was', 'creator', 'shows', 'oversaw', 'shows', 'then', 'why', 'was', 'Angel', 'so', 'good', 'Buffy', 'seasons', '4', '5', '7', 'so', 'awful']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

The show based on Vampire and Demon slaying had a strong cast of individuals that really connected. The story lines sometimes riveting and other times not so much. The question everyone was asking is why is the show ending. Well as a mere fan i have my opinion. After Season Six, which i believe to be one of the few where certain characters grow up fast, our Slayer and Scoobies just seem to be hanging around in that house. I mean sure they have the Big Bad that happens to be the First ( The original Evil on Earth) which they have to slay. But... take a look at Anya, Dawn, Xander, and Spike. These four characters just seem to be floating. There is no solid perpose for them throughout the season. Giles too. Everyone seems to be there, but really should be moving on, almost as thought something else needs to be done. These characters reached a point where they needed to move on. Their stories have been told and it was a satisfying finale. I believe this season to be one of the darkest ones. What i mean is that its a lot more hit and run scare tactics in the dark of night Dark, not like Season 5 Dark where life was dealing our friends a nasty deck of tarot cards that made life seem almost not worth living. All in all if you've bought all the seasons like i have, you cant leave this one behind. its really Good!",4,A Fitting end to a Series that had nowhere to go...,1094601600,"09 8, 2004",2004,1436,"['Buffy', 'out', 'doubt', 'Cult', 'Classic', 'Television', 'Show', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'programming', 'general', 'show', 'based', 'Vampire', 'Demon', 'slaying', 'had', 'strong', 'cast', 'individuals', 'really', 'connected', 'story', 'lines', 'sometimes', 'riveting', 'other', 'times', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'question', 'everyone', 'was', 'asking', 'why', 'show', 'ending', 'Well', 'mere', 'fan', 'i', 'have', 'opinion', 'Season', 'Six', 'believe', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'where', 'certain', 'characters', 'grow', 'fast', 'Slayer', 'Scoobies', 'just', 'seem', 'be', 'hanging', 'around', 'house', 'mean', 'sure', 'have', 'Big', 'Bad', 'be', 'First', 'original', 'Evil', 'Earth', 'have', 'slay', 'take', 'look', 'Anya', 'Dawn', 'Xander', 'Spike', 'four', 'characters', 'just', 'seem', 'be', 'floating', 'solid', 'perpose', 'season', 'Giles', 'too', 'Everyone', 'be', 'there', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'moving', 'almost', 'thought', 'something', 'else', 'be', 'done', 'characters', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'needed', 'move', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'was', 'satisfying', 'finale', 'believe', 'season', 'be', 'one', 'darkest', 'ones', 'What', 'i', 'mean', 'lot', 'more', 'hit', 'run', 'scare', 'tactics', 'dark', 'night', 'Dark', 'not', 'Season', '5', 'Dark', 'where', 'life', 'was', 'dealing', 'friends', 'nasty', 'deck', 'tarot', 'cards', 'made', 'life', 'seem', 'almost', 'not', 'worth', 'living', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'seasons', 'i', 'have', 'cant', 'leave', 'one', 'behind', 'really', 'Good']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

It's better to leave the audience wanting more then wishing you'd stopped. There are a lot of good episodes and the acting and writing are excellent. Overall this was my fav. season.

Season 5 introduced Dawn, had Buffy's mom die of natural causes, had her lose Riley and eventually even die, so yeah that was depressing. Dawn was at least cute and a good addition to the show though. Season 6 was mostly silly and decided to be violent and serious in the last episodes of it's season. Season 7 is the last season since Sarah Michelle Gellar wanted to move on to do other parts ""laughs"".I forgot she played Daffney in Scooby Doo already and oh yeah wasn't she in that bad Grudge movie ? She needs to beg Joss to write and direct a Buffy movie because she needs face it that Buffy is what she does best. Anyway this isn't a 100% worthy last season but it's way better than season 6 at least. After Firefly was canceled Nathan Fillion jumped over to Buffy as some episodes as a slimy ""not literly slimy"" invinceable evil priest guy. He makes you hate him and want to see him get what's coming to him. He man handles potential slayers and kills them violently. Oh he also pokes out Xander's eye. This guy is pure evil and a worthy villian to the show. I'm still not sure where he got his powers from though, I guess the First just gave them to him or maybe it's the church wine lol. It's funny how Adam Baldwin from Firefly also was on the last season of Angel as an unstoppable agent. It also wasn't explained how he got his powers as well.The First by the way is the first evil ever and make itself look like anyone that is dead. It made an appearnce in season 3 and tried to get Angel to kill himself in the Christmas episode. Here it mostly trys to drive Spike mad by appearing to be Buffy ""since Buffy died once or twice if you count season 1 when she died for a minute or 2"". There's also a tougher breed of vampires that even Buffy has trouble with at first. So the last season at least has worthy villians.It's also nice seeing Faith ""the sexy Eliza Dushku"" back. She finally makes up with Buffy and helps train the potential Slayers. The potentials at first decide they rather have her as their leader than Buffy. Angel also appears in the last episode of the series and Spike gets jealous when the two kiss. While Angel is jealous that Spike now also has a soul and that he's closer to Buffy. Sarah could've at least repaid David by appearing in the last episode to help out instead of Angel just ending with him getting ready to have a big battle. Instead Angel just ended with it appearing that him and all his friends will die. While Buffy at least has a somewhat happy ending.

Season 7 has some amazing episodes, starting with ""Same Time Same Place"" which was the creepiest episode since ""Hush"", ""Selfless"" where we finally get to see Anyas past. ""Conversations With Dead People"" which is exactly what it is. It's a frightening episode, one of the shows scariest. ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" where we learn more about Spikes past, and the finale ""Chosen"" where Buffy and the gang go up against their final battle. Season 7 saw the addition of the ""potential"" which at times was very distracting. There were too many to keep track of, and I didn't care about any of them, not even Kennedy, Willows new love interest. This storyline bothered me because I thought it was too soon for Willow to start dating after Tara. The addition of Andrew to this season was a nice touch.

My disappointment stems from the extras and commentaries- they are sorely lacking. The outtakes are brief and lame, and the commentaries add next to nothing to the series. Emma Caulfield (Anya) was supposed to do commentary on her spotlight episode, but she was a no-show. It would have been wonderful if there had been more behind the scenes footage of the last episode, but nothing. And Joss Whedon's commentary is just boring. It probably would have been better if a fan or critic had interviewed him during the commentary, in order to get him to talk about things that would have been interesting to the viewers. Maybe some insight as to why Sarah Michelle Gellar didn't do any commentaries, what their working relationship was like, why did he give Dawn the last line instead of Buffy, anything like that. Otherwise, who cares what we think about this particular season?

849440,A1E1I0VK9ZI0XW,B0002XVKMC,J. Pastrana,"[6, 9]","Even on a bad day (er, episode) Buffy the Vampire Slayer has always proven to be a show superior to the drivel network television routinely produces. Point in fact - seasons 2, 3 and 5 - were so jaw-droppingly spectacular that it seems hardly possible the brilliant people behind the show (Mr. Whedon and company) could come up with better. And they couldn't. Season 6 was a valiant effort at maintaining the show's momentum and indeed had episodes (eg. Normal Again and the three part finale) worthy of being among the series' best. The same goes with Season 7. Like the previous season, the overall concept itself was good but the actual results were uneven. Inconsistencies abound and the series finale lacked the emotional gravitas of previous efforts (eg. sacrificing Angel at the end of season 2 and Buffy's suicide leap at the end of season 5). That being said, we all have our personal preferences (myself - Xander should've displayed a bit more grief at Anya's death, Kennedy is such a pitifully inadequate substitute for Tara, and Buffy's relationship with Spike is nothing short of the kind of self-destructive stupidity that lands people on the Jerry Springer show - and Buffy deserves better than that). But ultimately - even the most mundane episode that comes out of Buffy is far and above more intelligent and moving, scarier and knee-slapping funnier than most anything else out there. It will be sorely missed.",4,End of an Era,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,1428,"['Even', 'bad', 'day', 'er', 'episode', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'always', 'proven', 'be', 'show', 'superior', 'drivel', 'network', 'television', 'routinely', 'Point', 'fact', 'seasons', '2', '3', '5', 'were', 'so', 'jaw-droppingly', 'spectacular', 'hardly', 'possible', 'brilliant', 'people', 'show', 'Mr.', 'Whedon', 'company', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'could', ""n't"", 'Season', '6', 'was', 'valiant', 'effort', 'maintaining', 'show', 'momentum', 'indeed', 'had', 'episodes', 'eg', 'Normal', 'Again', 'three', 'part', 'finale', 'worthy', 'being', 'series', 'best', 'same', 'Season', '7', 'previous', 'season', 'overall', 'concept', 'was', 'good', 'actual', 'results', 'were', 'uneven', 'Inconsistencies', 'abound', 'series', 'finale', 'lacked', 'emotional', 'gravitas', 'previous', 'efforts', 'eg', 'sacrificing', 'Angel', 'end', 'season', '2', 'Buffy', 'suicide', 'leap', 'end', 'season', '5', 'being', 'said', 'have', 'personal', 'preferences', 'Xander', 'should', ""'ve"", 'displayed', 'bit', 'more', 'grief', 'Anya', 'death', 'Kennedy', 'such', 'pitifully', 'inadequate', 'substitute', 'Tara', 'Buffy', 'relationship', 'Spike', 'nothing', 'short', 'kind', 'self-destructive', 'stupidity', 'people', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'show', 'Buffy', 'better', 'ultimately', 'even', 'most', 'mundane', 'episode', 'Buffy', 'far', 'more', 'intelligent', 'moving', 'scarier', 'knee-slapping', 'funnier', 'most', 'anything', 'else', 'there', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'missed']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season
849441,A2KXQ1CIU9B8Z2,B0002XVKMC,JR,"[0, 0]","So it all comes to end, and boy does it ever! Season 7, the final season of Buffy goes out with a real bang, though not on the level of perfection that Whedon achieved at the end of Season 5, but close enough. Season 5 was supposed to be the end. Seasons 6 and 7 were spared by UPN, and Joss Whedon and crew were given the green light. So this is essentially the second ending of the series. And As always, there seems to be that one episode that knocks your socks off and creates an instant classic, this one being ""Conversations with Dead People"" This one ranks with Hush, Once more with Feeling, and other classic episodes, abliet more subtley. Overall for the first half of the season you do not get a villain more terrifying then Kaleb being controlled by the first. It looks real bad for the scooby gang, and it gets worse. He treats them like rag dolls for a good part of the series. Ultimatley however, there are two vital connections that make this final season so important, The First, or the first evil. Willow and Buffy in and of themselves have thrown the balance out of life and death out of sync, and the first wants to teach everyone but, especially Buffy, a lesson about messing with the balance. Overall and exciting, sobering season that will leave you breathless, excited, but maybe, depending, not all together satisfied. But Joss does it better then anyone, and in the link of all seven seasons, your eyes will be glued to the screen. Great TV. ""Chosen"" rocked!!!! The DVD package is solid, and packed with great extras, including easter eggs, and the commentaries and documentaries are spot on.  This is a wondeful DVD, and a wonderful tribute to this series. For Many of us, this is where the series ended before it became a comic book for season 8, I prefere to remember it the way it was.Season 7, Episode 1: LessonsOriginal Air Date--24 September 2002Sunnydale High is re-opened, with a new designed campus and a new principal, Robin Wood.

I liked how they brought back sunnydale high and the hellmouth and the first it completes the full circle to finish what started. When they brought all those potential slayers into the hellmouth city I knew that it was gonna be the last ride. But when willow changed them all into slays instead of just 2 slayers so that they could prepare to fight the war between the uber vamps and slayers that had awaken everywhere. And when the fight was over sunnydale is sunnydale no more cuz the hellmoth collasped along with sunnydale. Buffy could retire now cuz she had completed her destiny.

While, I like the ""The First Evil"" as a Big Bad idea, the storyline could be more intriguing and exciting. Because in the middle of the season pretty much nothing seems to happen, and it gets you (me at least) bored from the season. It continues very slowly, and there's nothing happening that is important for the storyline. Other than that, I have another problem, potentials: they enter, they stay and they never leave. They become a block to the main four core character whose' energy and connection we love about the show.So, these are big reason the final season gets bad reputation.

As a buffy fan from the beginning I have to say that this season has got to be one of the best. The whole season plays like a movie, it is very intense and got viewers at the edge of their seats week after week excited to find out how the season unfolds and now, you get to own it on DVD loaded with tones of extras that would keep you busy for hours.It is obvious that the writers have had this season planned out right from the start. The flow of episodes is very smooth and not one episode has the feeling that it is out of place. Apart from being an excellent season story-wise, this season also provided a respectable ending to such an incredible show. Through the course of the season, the show went back to the basics and gave the past seven years a good sum up, this is of course highlighted in the first episode `Lessons', with the writers bringing back the infamous sunnydale high school and the big bads of each season.However, this season does not just focus on the ultimate battle between good and evil, it also took time out to concentrate on the characters and dealt with the events that was left open in the earlier seasons. An example of which was demonstrated in the episode ""selfless"" when the `kick his ass' speech was brought up again. You must have thought they had forgotten about that already.The actors were also at their best this season. Each of them was given an opportunity to shine. There were some very funny moments (episode 6 ""Him"") as well as heart breaking ones (episode 4 ""Help"").

The Picture and Sound quality are so very good that you feel as though you are watching it in a theater. The closed captioning and Audio come in other languages besides English. It's jam packed with all sorts of extra bonus special features, plus a special series end wrap party that is a whole lot of fun. Everything you ever wanted to know about Buffy, cast, The Brilliant creator, Joss Whedon and other staff members. I not only highly recommend this Season disk set, but the other six seasons as well. Quite a bit of quality work went into the making of all seven seasons. They are a necessary buy for any Buffy fan! It's completely impossible to be anything but extremely pleased with this purchase as well as the rest of the series. The writing, acting, directing, etc... are extraordinary. This is feature film quality at it's finest, instead of the plain old TV quality that most people expect. Each episode is like watching a movie. The last five episodes build to a finale that is as amazing as any feature film that I have never before seen on television. The final episode was extraordinary, the writing, the premise was ingenious. The acting was the usual above average talent. I believe that the music that Rob Duncan provided was the icing on the cake and made the episode EPIC. It was brilliant music. Of all seven seasons this is truly my favorite. If you don't own any then by all means at least purchase season seven.Here's Season Seven's Line Up:1. Lessons2. Beneath You3. Same Time, Same Place4. Help5. Selfless6. Him7.

849447,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002XVKMC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 5]","It is fair to say that the finale season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was going to end up being an anti-climax.  For me the high point of the series was always going to be ""Becoming, Part 2,"" at the end of the second season, and it was always rather impressive that Joss Whedon could come close in the seasons that followed.  The ending was never quite as operatic, but more importantly the weakest episodes each year were a lot stronger and we came to expect that very best stories might pop up in the middle of the season, as with ""Hush,"" ""The Body,"" and ""Once More With Feeling.""One of the advantages of watching a season from start to finish on DVD is that you can see how the ending is set up.  That was especially true for the sixth season, where knowing that Darth Rosenberg was going to be the Big Bad at the end makes you reconsider what is happening from the very start.  There is a clue as to the conclusion of the series in the very first scene of ""Lessons,"" where a girl runs for her life in Istanbul only to be killed by men in black robes.  She is the first of the Potential Slayers to be killed, but nowhere near the last to fall at the hands of the minions of the First (Evil).There is an effort to get back to the beginning with Dawn now a student in the new Sunnydale High School and Buffy a guidance counselor of sorts, while Principal Wood becomes the first new adult non-undead member of the inner circle since Jenny Calendar works to good effect.  However, I think that it was a lot harder to accept Kennedy following after Tara as Willow's lover than it was to accept Riley after Angel left, and now that we know Whedon had a story idea in which Buffy is granted one wish and uses it to bring back Tara (instead of getting a pair of really great shoes).  I know I am supposed to want to have Willow be happy and that the idea of her not being the dominant person in the relationship was worth pursuing but it never really clicked for me.Spike getting his soul also proved to be more problematic than I would have thought.  If you look at Spike on season six of ""BtVS"" and season five of ""Angel"" you cannot really tell there was ever a season of ""BtVS"" in between.  For that matter the idea that the First, having been introduced in season three (""Amends"") has waited all this time to become the final Big Bad seems to be flawed.  Ultimate Evil does not usually wait three years to finally decide the time has come to kill the Slayer, even if Buffy's second return from the grave upsets the cosmic calculus.  However, given the initial premise of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as a decidedly feminist twist on the stereotype of the blonde girl being attacked by the monster, the end point of the series being the actualization of female empowerment on the grand scale of all the Potentials becoming Slayers is certainly fitting.  This also completely justifies the return of Faith for the final five episodes, which should have been and was more important than Angel's cameo.The lighter side is relatively limited in the final season, but having the Summers sisters fighting for the same high school jock in ""Him"" was fun, we get to see Anya's past in ""Selfless,""  and Andrew's documentary on ""Buffy, a Slayer of the Vaympyrs"" in ""Storyteller"" has its moment (but laughing at the fate of Kitty Fantastico revealed in ""End of Days"" is just wrong).  But the predominant tone is decidedly dark, underscored by what happens to Xander (""Dirty Girls""), but certainly set up by the growing body count of Potentials at the hands of the Bringers, the Ubervamp, and Caleb.  The fact that the First can take whatever pleasing form its desires, which makes for a brisk walk down memory lane at the end of ""Lessons,"" but necessarily means this Big Bad is never really personified.  Given that the empowerment of women is the final lesson of the series, I am now wondering if the final Big Bad should not have represented more of the impulse towards the subservience of women, not that I especially know how that would be personified, but there are some definite possibilities (Caleb being such a misogynist indicates as much).Ultimately, what makes the seventh season the least satisfying is that so many of the episodes are dedicated to the main story arc, that we really do not have a first rate classic episode among the final twenty two.  I am defining ""classic"" here as one of those favorite episodes you keep rewatching.  ""Chosen"" is the closest, but it is not a stand alone episode by any means.  This become ironic because one of the strengths of Whedon's show was how the first half story arc would combine with the second half story arc, and so this was really more of the same, but different enough that it did not reach the heights we had become accustomed to in previous seasons.  However, none of this detracts from what Whedon hath wrought in seven glorious seasons.  Nobody who bought the first six is going to miss out on this last one.The DVD extras have steadily approved from the first season collection.  In the better late than never department more of the actors are showing up on the seven commentary tracks (Danny Strong, Tom Lenk, James Marsters, D.B. Woodside, and Nicholas Brendon), but Joss Whedon still sets the standard and provides the benediction for ""BtVS"" with his commentary on ""Chosen.""  For featurettes there is the overview of Season Seven ""Buffy: Full Circle,"" and pieces on ""Buffy: It's Always Been About the Fans,"" ""Buffy 101: Studying the Slayer,"" ""Generation S,"" and ""The Last Sundown.""  Be sure to actually check out the ""Willow Demon Guide"" on the DVD-ROM, which is a lot better than the outtake reel (which are never as funny as I think they are going to be, which is okay, because who wants a gag reel that is funnier than the actual show?).Final Note: Once again with the new opening credits the final shot of Buffy is still not Buffy.  The previous one ended with a shot of the Buffy-bot from ""The Gift"" and this one ends with the First appearing as Buffy from ""Lessons.""  Is this a pointed master metaphor or simply a mistake made twice?

As his viewers have come to expect, Whedon introduced some new characters and expanded on the old ones.

Season 7 was no exception. Particulary entertaining was Andrew and his going from evil to good. Now with Angel over and Firefly only having lasted a season, there's a big void in the Whedon universe.

But, like someone before said, even a mediocre season of Buffy is good to watch.For the first time since I began buying the DVD sets, I found myself wanting some episodes to END as soon as possible (while inother seasons all I wanted was for them to never end, so good they were!)This was a shock. The episode ""HIM"" is one of the worst ever.AS for The POtentials. When they were three or four, you could stand them. When they became dozens of people, it was awful. So awgul that I became to dislike all of them, even the first ones to take shelter in Buffy's house: Kennedy, Amanda, the black girl, everybody! It simply left no room for the scoobies. Michelle Tratchenberg suffered the most. COmpare her with her screen time in season Six: almost gone. Anya, except for the episode that she kills a dozen students, is also absent.Nothing against gay relations, but... maybe it was securing the show some points in the audience ratings, but it was absurd the amount of times that they showed Kennedy and Willow kissing each other. It was annoying. By the way, it seems six months it's all that you need to forget the love of your life! (Tara).The introduction of Andrew as the comic relief was good in my humble opinion. It worked fine. James MAsters's Spike is top notch as always. The return of Faith was welcome, but say what you want, I think Eliza is simply not a good actress. She delivers her lines in an unnatural manner, it always seems forced.The ending... well the ending was much less climatic thatn I had anticipated...",3,I give three stars with my heart bleeding....,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,1644,"['give', 'season', 'three', 'stars', 'heart', 'bleeding', 'Why', 'must', 'agree', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'season', 'someone', 'before', 'said', 'even', 'mediocre', 'season', 'Buffy', 'good', 'watch.For', 'first', 'time', 'began', 'buying', 'DVD', 'sets', 'found', 'wanting', 'episodes', 'END', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'inother', 'seasons', 'wanted', 'was', 'never', 'end', 'so', 'good', 'were', 'was', 'shock', 'episode', 'HIM', 'one', 'worst', 'ever.AS', 'POtentials', 'When', 'were', 'three', 'four', 'could', 'stand', 'When', 'became', 'dozens', 'people', 'was', 'awful', 'So', 'became', 'dislike', 'even', 'first', 'ones', 'take', 'shelter', 'Buffy', 'house', 'Kennedy', 'Amanda', 'black', 'girl', 'everybody', 'simply', 'left', 'room', 'scoobies', 'Michelle', 'Tratchenberg', 'suffered', 'most', 'COmpare', 'screen', 'time', 'season', 'Six', 'almost', 'gone', 'Anya', 'episode', 'dozen', 'students', 'also', 'absent.Nothing', 'gay', 'relations', 'maybe', 'was', 'securing', 'show', 'points', 'audience', 'ratings', 'was', 'absurd', 'amount', 'times', 'showed', 'Kennedy', 'Willow', 'kissing', 'other', 'was', 'annoying', 'way', 'six', 'months', 'need', 'forget', 'love', 'life', 'Tara', '.The', 'introduction', 'Andrew', 'comic', 'relief', 'was', 'good', 'humble', 'opinion', 'worked', 'fine', 'James', 'MAsters', 'Spike', 'top', 'notch', 'always', 'return', 'Faith', 'was', 'welcome', 'say', 'want', 'think', 'Eliza', 'simply', 'not', 'good', 'actress', 'lines', 'unnatural', 'manner', 'always', 'forced.The', 'ending', 'well', 'ending', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'climatic', 'thatn', 'had', 'anticipated']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

This is the second season Joss Whedon was not fully invloved with the show and it's obvious. ""The first"" is the Big bad this season and he is bad when the story calls for it and then chucnks of episodes are just filler until he resurfaces again. Instead we get Main cast members with nothing to do and The Slayers getting much more screen time. This is unfair to the longtime viewers and the actors. We also get the wishy washy Buffy/Spike relationship which never should have taken place but did(yawn). Faith comes back but has little to do unlike her turn on Angel the same season and an ending that seems rushed. With all the lackluster episodes leading up to the finale, couldn't they  have done more to resolve the story, finish and then after the events that occur to save everyone in Sunnyvale, had an episode where we get a conclusion to everyone's story? Some character interaction instead of 10 minutes at the end of this episode.This is an improvement after Season 6  but these last two seasons of Buffy were nowhere near the quality of the last two of Angel and I keep thinking Joss should have ended it after Season 5.I'll add this to my collection only because I have all other seasons and because there are a handful of decent episodes that were good I partially reccomend it for the die hards but let's hope we get a Big screen followup with the reuniting of Buffy and Angel like it should have been.",3,Could have gone out with a bang,1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,1544,"['season', 'started', 'out', 'great', 'potential', 'Season', 'six', 'went', 'down', 'hill', 'very', 'little', 'stand', 'out', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'second', 'season', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'was', 'not', 'fully', 'invloved', 'show', 'obvious', 'first', 'Big', 'bad', 'season', 'bad', 'when', 'story', 'then', 'chucnks', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'filler', 'again', 'Instead', 'get', 'Main', 'cast', 'members', 'nothing', 'do', 'Slayers', 'getting', 'much', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'unfair', 'longtime', 'viewers', 'actors', 'also', 'get', 'wishy', 'washy', 'Buffy/Spike', 'relationship', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'did', 'yawn', 'Faith', 'back', 'little', 'do', 'turn', 'Angel', 'same', 'season', 'ending', 'rushed', 'lackluster', 'episodes', 'leading', 'up', 'finale', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'more', 'resolve', 'story', 'finish', 'then', 'events', 'occur', 'save', 'everyone', 'Sunnyvale', 'had', 'episode', 'where', 'get', 'conclusion', 'everyone', 'story', 'character', 'interaction', 'instead', '10', 'minutes', 'end', 'episode.This', 'improvement', 'Season', '6', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'were', 'nowhere', 'quality', 'last', 'two', 'Angel', 'keep', 'thinking', 'Joss', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'Season', '5.I', ""'ll"", 'add', 'collection', 'only', 'have', 'other', 'seasons', 'are', 'handful', 'decent', 'episodes', 'were', 'good', 'partially', 'reccomend', 'die', 'hards', 'let', 'hope', 'get', 'Big', 'screen', 'followup', 'reuniting', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'should', 'have', 'been']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season
849459,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B0002XVKMC,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[5, 6]","BUFFY's seventh season wasn't just the final bow of a great series, it was an out-and-out comeback. A lot of fans were unsure if it could recover from the relative low point that was the sixth season, but with its legacy more-or-less on the line, the cast, writers and producers of BtVS joined together and delivered the goods when it mattered most. Whereas the troubled S6 made me wonder if ""the name outlived the man"", the seventh followed the oldest rule in show biz: ""Always leave `em wanting more.""Things I liked:* The blasts from the past. It was great fun to see, however briefly, Buffy's Big Bads parade across the screen; this is just the sort of thing diehard fans love. I always wanted to see Mark Metcalf (the Master) do a scene with Spike (""It's going to be an interesting couple of months and I think we're all going to learn a lot. You're going to learn that you're a pathetic shmuck."")* The Nikki/Robin Wood/Spike sub-plot. I was expecting something like this for years (actually I was expecting Kendra's watcher to show up) and I think it was nicely handled except for the way it was resolved - or rather, not resolved.* Sunnydale High. Nice to ""go home"" again even if it was a different set.* I truly enjoyed the all-too-brief fight between Spike and Faith. Buffy beat up Spike so many times in Seasons 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 it was easy to forget that before he met his match in her, he was a Slayer slayer (he gave Kendra a beating in Season 2, as I recall).* The return of vamps as primary villain. For a show with VAMPIRE in the title there was not much focus on the bumpy-forehead set after about Season Four. The ubervamps were a nice touch.* Nathan Fillion's ""preacher"" was not by any means my favorite Big Bad, but he was by far the most hateful. Previous Bads were so entertaining it was hard to have any real animosity toward them; not so with him. He was loathsome, sadistic, arrogant, vicious and just nasty.* Slayer army...very innovative and well done.* The overall story arc was very strong; the sub-plots weaved well into the main thread of story; everybody had a part to play and played it well. Tony Head did an especially good job of showing Giles' seldom displayed ruthless side.* All Buffy seasons have a ""crisis point"" where you think things can't get worse and then they do. Season Seven has a brilliant one with Buffy getting ousted as the leader. E tu, Scoobies?* Xander's ""seven years"" speech to Dawn. I thought this was brilliantly written and brilliantly acted. I often wondered how X. felt about being ""standing just outside the spotlight.""Things I didn't like:* A really gutsy move would have been to have Robin kill Spike, or Spike kill Robin. It would have been as jaw-dropping as a certain murder that occurs in the last season of ANGEL.* The political agenda. Sorry to sound like Agent Mulder having a paranoid moment, but it seemed to me like Joss W. was trying to shovel in as many social-political messages in this season as he possibly could; (explicit gay sex, interracial sex, a bad guy wearing a priest's collar vs. good guy pagans, Buffy emasculating the villain with an axe, etc.) I thought it was preachy and crass.* Kennedy. I hated, hated, hated this chatacter and think she was the worst ever introduced in the series. The idea that she and Willow would end up together just because they are both lesbians was insulting. It was easy to see why Willow could fall for Tara, who was charming, sweet, and pure of heart; Kennedy, on the other hand, was an obnoxious slut. I also had issues with the way their sex was handled. Tara & Willow's scenes were done metaphorically (casting spells as a metaphor for lovemaking) and were classy and beautiful. Willow and Kennedy's romps to cheesy rock music looked like Skinimax at 3 AM. Was this really the same character of the first three seasons?* I would have loved it if Xander and Buffy had gotten together. It is my understanding the actors themselves wanted this to happen, but JW torpedoed it. Too bad. I believe it was a logical outcome to their friendship, which intensified greatly in the Sixth Season; also to the fact that Xander had become a man and no longer carried a torch for Buffy, which is of course the surest way to get her interest.* The thing with the Guardians was silly and lame. It wasn't necessary to the plot and should have been eliminated. I could have done without the excessive use of the nerds from the sixth season, Joss seems to be nearly obsessed with these characters, who are tolerable only in smallish doses as comic relief. And the nerd in me was a bit disturbed by the fact that the graves of Joyce Summers and Jenny Calendar were among the parts of Sunnydale which dissapeared into the abyss. Kind of callous.* While I was glad to see so many familiar faces from past seasons, including David Boreanaz, I really wanted to see others, including Eric Balfour (who played Jesse in the pilot; he was the ""first soldier down"" and it would have been great to have him do a scene opposite Xander, who killed him); Robia LaMorte (Jenny), Oz (one suspects this character was not brought back for ""political"" i.e. sexual correctness reasons; it wasn't correct to make Willow bisexual, she had to be full-on gay!); Ethan Rayne, Riley Finn and Willy the Snitch. I also would have loved to see the First assume the Master's shape and then have one of the ubervamps do a double take as if to say, ""Daddy?""(OK, most of this is the nerdly nit-picking you would expect from oh, say, Comic Book Guy, but hey, what's the use of being a fan if you can't be unrealistic and difficult?) As a rule, I thought the season was very good, respectful of the show's history and mythology, and that it produced some episodes as good as anything from the ""golden age"" of Seasons 1 - 3. The finale was appropriately operatic in scope, beautifully scored, with great performances all around, and had a beautiful full-circle moment just at the climax between Buffy, Giles, Xander and Willow (""The earth is doomed."") To sum it up: BUFFY was one of the greatest television shows ever, and it was very important for it to exit the stage the same way it appeared.

849460,A82LIVYSX6WZ9,B0002XVKMC,Michael Bolts,"[3, 8]","THE FINAL SEASON OF BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYERAlthough it's not the best season it was sure a kick ass season, to say the least and a kick ass finale to a fine show. The season starts off with Buffy becoming a school counseler, Spike returns with a soul, Dawn goes into the new high school, Willow returns from England and too many slayers to keep count. The first like 6 episodes are alright, but not that great and from then on it gets pretty good, with the story line of Andrew and Jonathan coming back into town, Spike's little trigger in his brain, the potentials, those blind guys, the first, those uber vamps, Giles' return, the secret life of Principal Robin Wood and his past, the return of Faith and the ever so prescense of that a-hole priest Caleb and the end of Sunnydale California. Sarah Michelle Gellar is still cute but doesnt it just seem like she doesnt care now. Tom Lenk spourts some of the best moments in this season with his geeky, motor mouthed Andrew, and I especially likes the episode Storyteller..fun stuff. Once again this season pays its dues to the talented acting of my main man James Marsters who still knows how to play Spike to the ends of the world. Nicholas Brendon and Alyson Hannigan bring Willow and Xander to the final days of Sunnydale and as does Michelle Trachtenberg with Dawn. Didnt Anya's death seemed forced and I bet Emma Caulfield was thrilled to be killed off. Anthony Stewart Head or as I like to call him Head Boy, brings Giles into his final days as well but it looks like Giles is getting to old for that S**t, dont you think. D.B. Woodside as Robin Wood...man, the brother brings in a nicely done role and with the sexual chemistry bewtween him and Eliza Dushku's Faith, man it's good writing. ah, returning again for this season is Adam Busch as Warren,Elizabeth Anne Allen as Amy, Juliet Landau as Drusilla and surprising guest appearances at the beginning by all the major bad asses. Lastly folks, we get down to the evil son of a preacher man known as Caleb, played with brass ones by Nathan Fillion. I seem to like Caleb better then Adam and the rest, though who can forget the hot and spicy Clare Kramer...hmm. This unravels a bunch of the past and a big smile for the future (hence Angel Season Five=best season) anyway, I guess Joss Whedon will live on in all of us when we purchase this DVD and all the rest at extremely high prices and remember the words of Spike so long ago "" I may be loves bitch but at least I'm man enough to say it"".

849462,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0002XVKMC,Mitch Weaver,"[19, 25]","If I had to make a list of my top five favorite shows of all time, Buffy the Vampire Slayer would definately be on it. I have been a loyal fan of the show since the first season and it has continued to amaze me with the fantastic writing, acting, humor, and action. Both seasons five and six were amazing and that is why I got my hopes up, especially considering the fact that this was going to be the show's last season. Unfortunately, season seven took a step back from the stellar fifth and sixth seasons. While season seven was definately watchable and a good season overall, it suffered from the same weakness as season four did. Both seasons four and seven had Buffy become a part of something much larger than working together with the ""Scooby gang"". Season four had Buffy working with the Iniative, and season seven had Buffy training potential slayers to fight the upcoming battle. The best aspect of the show is the interaction between the main characters, and when you stray away from that aspect of the show, the season will suffer.However, even watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer at its weakest, is still better than most of the other shows on television. While the overall storyline for season seven was the worst one since the fourth season, there was some very good stand alone episodes, and this season also featured one of the best villans to ever come out of the show in Caleb. Not to mention the brief but satisfying return of Angel near the end of the season, despite the fact that Buffy left the WB to go to UPN. Season seven also reopens Sunnydale High, which introduces a cool new character in Principal Wood who is the son of one of the slayers that Spike killed. This was perhaps my favorite aspect of season seven because even though Spike now has a soul, Principal Wood secretly plots to gain vengenance on Spike. Also, the one good thing to remain from season six was Andrew who serves as comic relief. He is tired of being evil, and struggles over the course of the whole season to try and become one of the group and prove himself. The funniest thing about it, is the fact that Buffy and the gang take him hostage at the beginning of the season to extract information, and then cannot get the guy to leave afterwards. Season seven also does a good job with the relationship between Spike and Buffy as well. A few episodes worth mentioning are ""Selfless"" which gives flashbacks into Anya's life as a vengenance demon, ""Conversations with Dead People"" which offers five seperate stories that has the gang encountering a paranormal force which spells future doom, ""Storyteller"" which focuses on Andrew creating a documentary on Buffy's life as a slayer, and the last two episodes of the season in ""End of Days"" and ""Chosen"" which offer a very fitting end to the show.Unfortunately all good things must come to an end, and I was sad to see the show wrap up. Although I was somewhat dissapointed with this season overall, it is still worth owning for fans of the show because of some fantastic episodes, the relationship between Spike and Buffy, and the introduction of two cool new characters in Principal Wood and Caleb. This is also perhaps the one time where the DVD extras are more of a reason to buy the set than the episodes themselves.

I discovered the show on DVD, and have made my way through the seven stellar box sets.It's now over, and I can honestly say I'm gonna miss these guys.That said...there were a few things that bugged me this season.The ""potentials"" business is pretty painful to watch all year long. It pays off in the final episode, in a big and unexpectedly fulfilling way, but for the most part, it kinda sucked.Andrew's geeky humor worked most of the time, but not all of the time.Some people did very little this year, like Anya, Giles and Dawn, although they each were given a token moment or two. I wanted Giles to be ""there"" more.And did anyone else notice a few too many references to the amazing musical episode of the previous year?And were there, like, SEVEN too many ""Henry V"" speeches by Buffy? (Which is hilariously pointed out by Andrew in one episode, by the way...)There. I'm done carping. As to what Whedon and company did right?Oh, pretty much everything else.Sarah Michelle Gellar is still the anchor...the foundation of the cast. She's just that good. I hope she finds something as epic as this to show off her talents to the world at large. I once dismissed her as an actress (as I did the show) for no real reason.My huge mistake. Big oops there, huh?I enjoyed the return to the high school arena, and thought DB Woodside did a fine job as the new principal.Xander's humble nobility was an unexpected delight, and James Marsters' Spike...well...there's one for the ages, isn't it?What an arc...from the impossibly evil, imposing swagger of his first years, through his comedic middle period to his very real love for Buffy.We need to develop a retro-Emmy for these folks, don't we? Yes we do.Anyways, the set design, special effects, music and sound are far and above anything else on TV, as usual, and the writing rebounds from an off-(but still really good) year.It is an inarguable fact: Buffy will go down as one of the best shows ever on television.It's operatic sweep, technical wizardry, impossibly good dialogue, obsessive attention to detail, explosive humor, dizzying romance and plain old great passionate storytelling I think will prove to be unique.This show had more soul than anything I've experienced in a long, long time.",4,"A fine finale to a soulful, passionate epic.",1103328000,"12 18, 2004",2004,2309,"['am', 'actually', 'sad', 'are', 'more', 'Buffy', 'watch', 'discovered', 'show', 'DVD', 'have', 'made', 'way', 'seven', 'stellar', 'box', 'sets.It', 'now', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', ""'m"", 'gon', 'miss', 'guys.That', 'said', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'bugged', 'potentials', 'business', 'pretty', 'painful', 'watch', 'year', 'long', 'final', 'episode', 'big', 'unexpectedly', 'fulfilling', 'way', 'most', 'part', 'kinda', 'sucked.Andrew', 'geeky', 'humor', 'worked', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'time.Some', 'people', 'did', 'very', 'little', 'year', 'Anya', 'Giles', 'Dawn', 'were', 'given', 'token', 'moment', 'two', 'wanted', 'Giles', 'be', 'more.And', 'did', 'anyone', 'else', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'references', 'amazing', 'musical', 'episode', 'previous', 'year', 'were', 'there', 'SEVEN', 'too', 'many', 'Henry', 'V', 'speeches', 'Buffy', 'Which', 'hilariously', 'pointed', 'out', 'Andrew', 'one', 'episode', 'way', ""'m"", 'done', 'carping', 'what', 'Whedon', 'company', 'did', 'right', 'Oh', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'else.Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'still', 'anchor', 'foundation', 'cast', 'just', 'good', 'hope', 'something', 'as', 'epic', 'show', 'off', 'talents', 'world', 'large', 'once', 'dismissed', 'actress', 'did', 'show', 'real', 'reason.My', 'huge', 'mistake', 'Big', 'oops', 'there', 'huh', 'enjoyed', 'return', 'high', 'school', 'arena', 'thought', 'DB', 'Woodside', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'new', 'principal.Xander', 'humble', 'nobility', 'was', 'unexpected', 'delight', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Spike', 'well', 'one', 'ages', ""n't"", 'What', 'arc', 'impossibly', 'evil', 'imposing', 'swagger', 'first', 'years', 'comedic', 'middle', 'period', 'very', 'real', 'love', 'Buffy.We', 'need', 'develop', 'retro-Emmy', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'Yes', 'do.Anyways', 'set', 'design', 'special', 'effects', 'music', 'sound', 'are', 'far', 'anything', 'else', 'TV', 'usual', 'writing', 'rebounds', 'off-', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'year.It', 'inarguable', 'fact', 'Buffy', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'television.It', 'operatic', 'sweep', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'impossibly', 'good', 'dialogue', 'obsessive', 'attention', 'detail', 'explosive', 'humor', 'dizzying', 'romance', 'plain', 'old', 'great', 'passionate', 'storytelling', 'think', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'unique.This', 'show', 'had', 'more', 'soul', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'long', 'long', 'time']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

We see Buffy try to act as a leader and the other characters start to step up to be adults in this season as well. Willow was still in denial of what she had done the previous season and it was hard for her to cope with the loss of Tara but she came through. Even Xander started to act like a leader and really provided motivation for the potentials.Season 7 is mainly about the end of the world as Buffy, Willow, Xander, Dawn, Spike, Giles, and Anya begin to learn how to fight the First that has come to Sunnydale. Perhaps the biggest change is that Spike gets his soul back and he continues in his quest to win Buffy's love. Along the way they pick up Andrew who spends most of the time as a hostage, and the potential slayers who get trained to take on evil that awaits them. Faith also comes back to aid the Scoobies for their final fight.What I really think was the problem about season 7 was that people didn't want to see their show change but it went out with a purpose rather than going out with some stupid plot that originated for the final three episodes.

849469,AZ2K08MNJFR16,B0002XVKMC,"N. Chiemelu ""movie slave""","[16, 28]","I agree with many who say that Season 7 wasn't on par with the great seasons of Buffy (seasons 2, 3 and 5), but it did rebound from the dismal Season 6 and ended with everyone mostly satisfied (except Anya who was killed and then not even Xander seemed to care).My only problem with Season 7 was mainly with the complete character 180s and the whole ""Spuffy"" issue.  I'll tackle these two separately.1: First off, the episode (I'm not that hardcore of a fan so I don't know the title) in which Buffy is kicked out of HER OWN HOME by the Potentials and the Scoobies.  What?  Buffy has always led the gang into big battles with somewhat risky plans (are we forgetting how she armed the whole senior class with flame throwers and axes to take on the mayor and an army of vampires during graduation?) yet all of a sudden now it's reason for mutiny and kicking her out of her own house?  Come on.  At least give us a better reason for that than just Faith getting hurt.  I mean, it's Faith.  No one there even likes Faith and all of a sudden ""she's part of the unit"" (to quote some ""Riley-speak"" from Season 5).  Not that I'm complaining about the Faith addition which I thought was one of the highlights of the season.  But the characters, relationships (Buffy getting mad at Giles over Spike?  Xander making a joke after learning that Anya died?) and actions throughout Season 7 were just out of character and seemed to have been written by people who had never watched the show before and pulling stuff out of their bums.2)Okay.  Seasons 2-4: Buffy hates Spike.  Season 5: Spike falls in love with Buffy, Buffy still dislikes Spike but now respects him as a fellow warrior because of his devotion to her and her sister.  Season 6: Buffy uses Spike for sex, dumps him and then Spike tries to rape Buffy.  Season 7: Buffy learns Spike has a soul and they have this unspoken strong bond based on love and loyalty.Um...huh?  Did I miss a special episode between seaons 6 and 7 where they explained how exactly this happened and why we were supposed to buy into the whole Spike and Buffy, real love, bit?  Spike (played by the amazing James Marsters) was a great character who was spayed (kinda literally) by the chip in his head and (figuratively) his love for Buffy.  Someone who was once an enjoyable character to watch became an Angel rip-off (I distinctly remember Joss Whedon saying Spike's re-ensoulment would be nothing like Angel's yet they turned Spike into Angel and even more whiny) who became nothing more than Buffy's panting lap dog.  What a shame.  I never bought the ""love"" between Buffy and Spike and it was almost an uneven relationship.  Buffy and Angel, for that matter, were never really that great until Angel left for his own show and then you could see their mature, understanding bond in the brief times when they crossed over on each other's show (Buffy coming on Angel during Angel Season 1, Angel showing up at Buffy's mom's funeral, etc.).  It wasn't until the last episode where Buffy plants a kiss on Angel as soon as she sees him and says ""Let me just bask"" that I realized that Spike doesn't hold a bloody candle to him.  Though I'm glad he came back on Angel's show where he was put to more good use other than Buffy's nancy-boy puppy dog.Oh, just some tidbits.1. Andrew was a great late addition to the Scoobies.  His episode made me laugh the whole way through and his scenes with Anya were always satisfying.2. Dawn really didn't need to be there which is sad because I like Michelle Tractenberg(?) (Nona on ""Pete and Pete"" for all those who can remember way back when) but in the Whedonverse, if you don't have superpowers or you're not funny, you're dead weight.  Sorry Dawnie.  and Riley too I guess.3. I wish Giles had been utilized more because he was sorely missed in Season 6.4. Wasn't a fan of Kennedy, can't really say why.5. Sorry that we didn't get to see Tara or Oz again.6. What was up with Ashanti being on the show?  Or rather, how much did Ashanti pay to be on the show? because I can't possibly imagine them actually asking her to do it.  Geez that was a bad special guest star.  She sure as hell isn't John Ritter.",4,A choppy but otherwise satisfying ending to a great show...,1101340800,"11 25, 2004",2004,4163,"['agree', 'many', 'who', 'say', 'Season', '7', 'was', ""n't"", 'par', 'great', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'seasons', '2', '3', '5', 'did', 'rebound', 'dismal', 'Season', '6', 'ended', 'everyone', 'mostly', 'satisfied', 'Anya', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'then', 'not', 'even', 'Xander', 'seemed', 'care', '.My', 'only', 'problem', 'Season', '7', 'was', 'mainly', 'complete', 'character', '180s', 'whole', 'Spuffy', 'issue', ""'ll"", 'tackle', 'two', 'separately.1', 'First', 'episode', ""'m"", 'not', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'title', 'Buffy', 'kicked', 'HER', 'OWN', 'HOME', 'Potentials', 'Scoobies', 'What', 'Buffy', 'always', 'led', 'gang', 'big', 'battles', 'somewhat', 'risky', 'plans', 'are', 'forgetting', 'how', 'armed', 'whole', 'senior', 'class', 'flame', 'throwers', 'axes', 'take', 'mayor', 'army', 'vampires', 'graduation', 'yet', 'sudden', 'now', 'reason', 'mutiny', 'kicking', 'out', 'own', 'house', 'Come', 'least', 'give', 'better', 'reason', 'just', 'Faith', 'getting', 'hurt', 'mean', 'Faith', 'one', 'there', 'even', 'Faith', 'sudden', 'part', 'unit', 'quote', 'Riley-speak', 'Season', '5', 'Not', ""'m"", 'complaining', 'Faith', 'addition', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'season', 'characters', 'relationships', 'Buffy', 'getting', 'mad', 'Giles', 'Spike', 'Xander', 'making', 'joke', 'learning', 'Anya', 'died', 'actions', 'Season', '7', 'were', 'just', 'character', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'pulling', 'stuff', 'bums.2', 'Okay', 'Seasons', '2-4', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'Season', '5', 'Spike', 'love', 'Buffy', 'Buffy', 'still', 'Spike', 'now', 'fellow', 'warrior', 'devotion', 'sister', 'Season', '6', 'Buffy', 'uses', 'Spike', 'sex', 'then', 'Spike', 'tries', 'rape', 'Buffy', 'Season', '7', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'soul', 'have', 'unspoken', 'strong', 'bond', 'based', 'love', 'loyalty.Um', 'huh', 'Did', 'miss', 'special', 'episode', 'seaons', '6', '7', 'where', 'explained', 'how', 'exactly', 'happened', 'why', 'were', 'supposed', 'buy', 'whole', 'Spike', 'Buffy', 'real', 'love', 'bit', 'Spike', 'played', 'amazing', 'James', 'Marsters', 'was', 'great', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'spayed', 'kinda', 'literally', 'chip', 'head', 'figuratively', 'love', 'Buffy', 'Someone', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'enjoyable', 'character', 'watch', 'became', 'Angel', 'rip-off', 'distinctly', 'remember', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'saying', 'Spike', 're-ensoulment', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'Angel', 'yet', 'turned', 'Spike', 'Angel', 'even', 'more', 'whiny', 'who', 'became', 'nothing', 'more', 'Buffy', 'panting', 'lap', 'dog', 'What', 'shame', 'never', 'bought', 'love', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'was', 'almost', 'uneven', 'relationship', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'matter', 'were', 'never', 'really', 'great', 'Angel', 'left', 'own', 'show', 'then', 'could', 'see', 'mature', 'understanding', 'bond', 'brief', 'times', 'when', 'crossed', 'over', 'other', 'show', 'Buffy', 'coming', 'Angel', 'Angel', 'Season', '1', 'Angel', 'showing', 'up', 'Buffy', 'mom', 'funeral', 'etc.', 'was', ""n't"", 'last', 'episode', 'where', 'Buffy', 'plants', 'kiss', 'Angel', 'as', 'soon', 'Let', 'just', 'bask', 'realized', 'Spike', ""n't"", 'hold', 'bloody', 'candle', ""'m"", 'glad', 'came', 'back', 'Angel', 'show', 'where', 'was', 'put', 'more', 'good', 'use', 'other', 'Buffy', 'nancy-boy', 'puppy', 'dog.Oh', 'just', 'tidbits.1', 'Andrew', 'was', 'great', 'late', 'addition', 'Scoobies', 'episode', 'made', 'whole', 'way', 'scenes', 'Anya', 'were', 'always', 'satisfying.2', 'Dawn', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'sad', 'like', 'Michelle', 'Tractenberg', 'Nona', 'Pete', 'Pete', 'who', 'can', 'remember', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'Whedonverse', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'superpowers', ""'re"", 'not', 'funny', ""'re"", 'dead', 'weight', 'Sorry', 'Dawnie', 'Riley', 'too', 'guess.3', 'wish', 'Giles', 'had', 'been', 'utilized', 'more', 'was', 'sorely', 'missed', 'Season', '6.4', 'Was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Kennedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'why.5', 'Sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'Tara', 'Oz', 'again.6', 'What', 'was', 'up', 'Ashanti', 'being', 'show', 'rather', 'how', 'much', 'did', 'Ashanti', 'pay', 'be', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'imagine', 'actually', 'asking', 'do', 'Geez', 'was', 'bad', 'special', 'guest', 'star', 'sure', 'hell', ""n't"", 'John', 'Ritter']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

Durham ""Big Evil""","[31, 69]","With Sarah Michelle Gellar's growing disatisfaction over her role, it came as no surprise that she didn't extend her contract; thus making season seven of Buffy the Vampire Slayer the final season.  Beginning with a poor season primere written by series creator Joss Whedon, Buffy and her crew are thrown into conflict with an entity called the First (you'll remember it from the season three episode opposing Angel) who is gathering a massive army to destroy the world.  In the meantime, new characters are introduced including Principal Wood (D.B. Woodside), a new villain named Caleb (Firefly's Nathan Fillion), Andrew (Tom Lenk) becomes an unlikely ally, and rogue slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku) returns for the final battle.  For the most part however, season seven is erratic at best.  An early episode examining Anya's (Emma Caulfield) past is excellent, and ""Conversations With Dead People"" is great as well, but such storyline elements as Willow's (Alyson Hannigan) redemption and Spike (James Marsters) gaining a soul appear to build up steam but go nowhere fast.  The final episode ""Chosen"" is a solid piece of television on it's own, but even hardcore fans will find some kind of disappointment out of it as Buffy and crew fight the final battle to close the Hellmouth.  Season seven is undoubtadly the worst season of Buffy, and as a fan it's just sad that the show went out with a whimper instead of the proverbial bang.",2,The end,1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,1431,"['Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'growing', 'disatisfaction', 'role', 'came', 'surprise', 'did', ""n't"", 'extend', 'contract', 'thus', 'making', 'season', 'seven', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'final', 'season', 'Beginning', 'poor', 'season', 'primere', 'written', 'series', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Buffy', 'crew', 'are', 'thrown', 'conflict', 'entity', 'called', 'First', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'season', 'three', 'episode', 'opposing', 'Angel', 'who', 'gathering', 'massive', 'army', 'destroy', 'world', 'meantime', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'including', 'Principal', 'Wood', 'D.B', 'Woodside', 'new', 'villain', 'named', 'Caleb', 'Firefly', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Andrew', 'Tom', 'Lenk', 'unlikely', 'ally', 'rogue', 'slayer', 'Faith', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'final', 'battle', 'most', 'part', 'however', 'season', 'seven', 'erratic', 'best', 'early', 'episode', 'examining', 'Anya', 'Emma', 'Caulfield', 'past', 'excellent', 'Conversations', 'Dead', 'People', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'storyline', 'elements', 'Willow', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'redemption', 'Spike', 'James', 'Marsters', 'gaining', 'soul', 'appear', 'build', 'up', 'steam', 'go', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'final', 'episode', 'Chosen', 'solid', 'piece', 'television', 'own', 'even', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'kind', 'disappointment', 'Buffy', 'crew', 'fight', 'final', 'battle', 'close', 'Hellmouth', 'Season', 'seven', 'undoubtadly', 'worst', 'season', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'just', 'sad', 'show', 'went', 'out', 'whimper', 'instead', 'proverbial', 'bang']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

849472,A32DTCFBBB9WIV,B0002XVKMC,PATHERSON,"[0, 2]","THis is a good season, but as is already well doccumented, tensions were arising between Sarah Michelle and the show producers, regarding the darkness of the stories, and you feel that in some ways Sarah, even very professional as always, is going on auto-pilot, just waiting for the show to end and she goes to another phase of her career. By the way, by buying this set I bought all seven seasons of Buffy, and I should ask: why does Sarah Michelle does not appear in ON SINGLE INTERVIEW along the seven sets?! I found it a huge dissapointment. (the only exception is an interview included in Season SIX , but which had already been aired elesewhere - it was not an interview made for the DVD).The season was great, but the Potentials were not. I know the show is all about female empowerment, but you could not even recognize the girls properly, since there were so many of them! But I think it was a clever history to make it clear that there was not only one Chosen One anymore, and that Buffy could try to lead a normal life from then on.""Conversations With Dead People"" is the great episode here. The last one, written by Joss himself, is not bad, but I felt something was missing... I think a much more clear ending for the scoobie gang would be welcome: what would they do afterwards, how would Xander reacts about life without Anya, how would WIllos hbehave like a goddess, all this stuff... I think the Scooby Gang (mainly Dawn - man, she was almost entirely forgotten in Season 7) had much less romm than they should. And Spike simply continued to grow and grow, both in charisma and in relevance.A good season.

849473,A14AD0NQTRVVJC,B0002XVKMC,Patrick J. Sullivan,"[12, 18]","This long review contains numerous spoilers.Various other reviewers have said much of what I'd like to say. The only part I don't understand is why so many people will cheerfully acknowledge the many flaws in season seven yet still give it five stars. I get that they may think that even in an off year it was still one of the better shows around, but if you give this season four or five stars, what do you give to season two? Eleven stars?I'll start with the negatives so I can finish on a positive note. My main problem with this season is the way that Dawn, Xander, Anya, and Giles got shunted to the back burner in favor of newcomers Principal Wood and the Potentials. Robin Wood was boring, his only interesting point coming when Spike brutally smacked him down. I also took against Wood when he hired a young girl barely out of high school, who had no qualifications to be a counselor, whose little sister was actually a current student, and then proceeded to put the moves on her. I know he didn't at first hire Buffy so that he could date her, but that whole set-up still pretty much defines sexual harassment. And a guy his age shouldn't be sniffing around 20 year-olds anyway (I know, he's centuries younger than Spike or Angel, but at least they weren't Buffy's employer or Dawn's principal).I agree with those reviewers who mostly resented the Potentials for robbing Dawn, Xander, etc. of screen time. I'm sitting there watching one episode's climactic scene between Kennedy and Warren (okay, it was supposed to be Willow in Warren's body, but obviously it was just Adam Busch as Warren), and I'm thinking, we put in seven years for this? No Anya or Xander, but plenty of Kennedy and Amanda? It wasn't even necessary. The real Buffy actors were there, they were just being shamefully underused.All except Alyson Hannigan as Willow, who as in Season Six is grossly overused this year. By far the weakest actor of the regulars, she portrays a character way too powerful for the show's good. With someone that much stronger than a Slayer around, there's really nothing special in being the Slayer anymore. You'd might as well brag about being the specially Chosen Xander. It figured that the final struggle would have little to do with Buffy but would instead consist of Willow performing a huge spell to help Spike's sacrifice win the day. Okay, that's a great magical finish for the show Willow the Too-Strong Witch Who Sometimes Tries to Kill Her Friends, but what does it have to do with Buffy the Vampire Slayer?The one bright spot among the new additions was Tom Lenk as Andrew. He had played third fiddle to Warren and Jonathan in season six, but with them dead, he came into his own in the last season. His character didn't belong there at all (and if the writers had still been writing sensibly, he just would have been returned to the jail he had broken out of), but that just made him all the more hilarious. Even when he's conning the First Evil, he's keeping up this dopey act of pretending to think the First really just wants to see Buffy's underwear (you have to see this to appreciate how ridiculous it is).As for the First Evil, it was indeed a poor ""Big Bad."" Not being able to touch things directly makes its menace fall rather flat. Though as some have noted, its supposed intangible nature doesn't quite square with the violent poltergeist antics it performed on Dawn and the house in its first appearance. The First could have been more threatening. I actually thought its revealing itself to Willow in the season's seventh episode, Conversations with Dead People, had some potential. When the First revealed that it was not in fact the dead Cassie, whom it had been impersonating, it did a really stomach-turning dissolve where Cassie seemed to turn inside out. But in its future appearances, the First simply faded to a bright line and winked out.But either way, this could have been a dramatic moment if the First had been impersonating Willow's dead lover Tara as the show's producers had wanted. But Amber Benson wouldn't appear, so they had to settle for Azura Skye as Cassie. This was a poor choice, as Cassie had just been a one-shot character whom Willow had never even met. If they had to use Cassie, they should have had her reveal herself to Buffy or Dawn, who actually knew the character. Or they should have used someone else to confront Willow, someone she actually knew in life (Jenny Calendar, for instance).As for the Dawn / Joyce storyline in that episode, it was never really followed up on. Supposedly the First as Joyce was warning Dawn that when the time came, Buffy wouldn't choose Dawn, whatever that meant. Well, if all that really portended was that as the apocalypse neared, Buffy would ask Xander to take Dawn to a safe place, big deal. Dawn resented being protected a little, but it's not like she regarded her big sister looking out for her as some huge betrayal.This was one of a number of strange false moves in this season, where the writers seemed to lose track of continuity with past seasons and even within the season itself. They rewrote Spike's recent history to have him traveling to Africa in search of his soul in season six, when that season had made it clear that he was actually looking for a way to get the mind-control chip out of his head.Now that Spike has been both ensouled and dechipped, he's a lot nicer and unfortunately, a lot less interesting. He's helpful without being violent, which isn't what Buffy needs right now. Only late in the season does he regain his form. One thing that is completely lacking in season seven is the former entertaining byplay between Spike and the various Scoobies. Giles barely notices he's there. There's no more big brother / little sister interaction between Spike and Dawn. He doesn't call Willow ""Red"" or even really deal with her on her own. He basically connects only to Buffy (and occasionally to Andrew). This is part of the larger problem of season seven, that the previous complex web of personal relationships that had made the show so strong is mostly nonexistent now. Most of the characters connect to Buffy on some level, but only rarely to each other. Where is the relationship between former business partners Anya and Giles? Where is Dawn's affection for Xander and Willow? (It's absent except for one scene with Xander).Spike being a mindless tool of the First, brainwashed and controlled by a song, rankles with some viewers. Spike as evil is interesting. Spike as a hapless sleepwalking murderer is not.Anya provides some of the most off-putting moments of the season. The character almost vanishes in the latter part of the season, though she does have a strong comeback in the final episode, with some great callously harsh lines directed toward the young Potentials. But early in the year, she lets her lingering resentment over being jilted by Xander lead her back into her vengeance demon days and she orchestrates a dozen brutal murders. Yes, these are magically undone by her former demon boss, T'Hoffran, but IMO that doesn't exactly let her off the hook morally. But as far as her friends are concerned, the whole thing might as well never have happened.There are a variety of inconsistent double standards involving how the Scoobies and others who have killed are treated. Andrew does not receive the same compassionate treatment that Willow does, and Willow skinned a man alive, tried to destroy the world, and repeatedly tried to hurt Dawn. Anya and Spike have both murdered repeatedly, yet it seems that Xander comes in for more criticism for his immature handling of the Anya situation than either of the former demons does. Killer Faith breaks out of prison and returns and all is forgiven, but Andrew is still treated like a leper.For someone so eager to protect her little sister, Buffy has an astounding blind spot regarding Willow. It is Willow, not Spike or the trio or the First, who has repeatedly tried to kill or hurt Dawn over the past two years. At some point even to your best friend you just have to say, I'll do whatever I can to help you get over your addiction to black magic,  but I can't have you living in my house anymore as long as you keep trying to kill my little sister. But after every one of Willow's screw-ups, there she is, installed back in the Summers' master bedroom, lording it over Buffy and Dawn. Why? Can't she get a job or an apartment or something? She's not in school anymore. It seems like Buffy's the only person in the whole group who ever works, besides Xander.Other reviewers have pointed out the weirdness of the group's communal living arrangements, which were strange and cramped enough already before Andrew and dozens of Potentials joined the village. Can't Giles get some hotel rooms for himself and his charges when he comes to town? We know the Watchers' Council has some funding, even if many of its members were blown up. Can't Willow crash at her mom's? Can't Xander take Andrew off their hands? Does Spike still have to sleep in the basement once he's cured? If nothing else, this would be a heck of an atmosphere for Dawn to try to base going to high school on. When you contrast the normalcy of Buffy's own high school environment with what she provides for her little sister, her guardianship skills don't impress you.Giles was really weak all season long, and I'm not sure why he was even there. He probably shouldn't have left early in season six when Buffy and Dawn still needed him. But when he returns, he doesn't seem to do so wholeheartedly. He isn't much help and in facts gets in Buffy's way. He doesn't even help Dawn with research or Willow with magic, and he basically just dumps the Potentials in Buffy's lap instead of training them as he once trained her. I don't know if Anthony Stewart Head was ambivalent about continuing with the role, but it was strange to see him listed as a guest star each and every week. If he was back, he should have been 100% back and been added to the opening credits again. Or he shouldn't have returned at all.The most unbelievable moment of the season came when Kennedy, Willow, Giles, Xander, Dawn, and the Potentials staged a coup on Faith's behalf and not only ousted Buffy from the Slayer leadership position, but actually kicked her out of her own house! Not even Dawn has the right to do that, and certainly Kennedy doesn't. And I just don't think the Dawn, Xander, or Giles we've met before would have even tried this. It isn't as if Buffy had really gone off the rails insanely or had started acted like Captain Bligh. But there are no long-term effects of this coup. Faith and the Potentials quickly find that not all their troubles can be traced to Buffy. Buffy is basically rehabilitated without anyone ever saying anything specific. So why even put us through the whole ordeal in the first place?And then right afterwards Buffy entrusts Dawn to Xander, telling him she can count on him. Well, as Spike put it, they were all ungrateful traitors, including Xander. How can Buffy count on anyone other than Spike, once they've all stabbed her in the back?The ending was rather feeble, especially when contrasted with the season five finale, The Gift. Then, to save her sister, Buffy had to sacrifice herself. Now, to save the whole world, Buffy had to sacrifice...Anya. Plus one of Xander's eyes. Spike was lost, but that was a victory rather than a defeat as he gained redemption. Buffy came out the big winner, as she no longer bears the burden of being the solitary Chosen One. Not much of a price to pay for saving the world, when you come out considerably better off than you were before.Nathan Fillion had been great as Captain Mal Reynolds on Joss Whedon's show Firefly, but his turn here as the fanatical preacher Caleb was poor. A hillbilly ex-reverend just doesn't mesh with the First. He was more a physical threat to Buffy and the gang than anything else, so why complicate things with poorly depicted religious details anyway? The season seven ""minions,"" the blind Bringers, were uninteresting and not very fearful. There was an ubervamp (which probably should have been called an ur-vamp), and then an army of them, but the one had proved much harder to kill than an entire army of them did.Having Angel show up and offer to fight was fitting. Having Buffy reject his help out of pride was just silly. No one's going to turn anyone helpful away when the world is at stake, and in fact no one has the moral right to. It's not about Buffy, and the Buffy of seasons past would have realized this. Indeed, the Buffy of this season makes a lot of tiresome speeches about how it's all about the job, but then she herself sends Angel back to L.A. because she thinks it's all about her proving herself without his help! Absurd and un-Buffy like. And the ""cookie dough"" speech was both pompous and silly. Of course the writers had to deal with the known fact that Buffy's show was ending while Angel's was continuing with him and without her, but still. The whole thing could have been approached differently.So what were the season's strong points, besides Andrew? Well, Emma Caulfield as Anya was entertaining as always. I don't like all of what the writers had Anya do, but Caulfield herself was superb. ""These girls are all going to die horribly,"" etc. Not the best nurse for scared, injured Potentials, but a great comedic talent besides being very attractive. Xander has really matured (other than in his role in the coup), and his brave acceptance of losing an eye was commendable. James Marsters as Spike as usual steals every scene he's in, though as I said, the ensouled Spike comes across as a bit of a wuss at first. At the series' end, the writers made it clear that Spike knew and accepted that Buffy didn't love him romantically (in an echo of an earlier scene with Riley), thus clearing the way for an eventual Angel-Buffy reunion.As in season six, Michelle Trachtenberg as Dawn wasn't on screen nearly enough, but she excelled with what material she was allowed. Particularly good was the episode where she first found out she was likely a Potential, only to have her hopes of being special like Buffy be dashed. Without skipping a beat, she went back to the thankless but necessary task of research, and only Xander realized that for her something monumental had occurred. The scene where Xander expresses his admiration for her was great, although he starts out talking about himself a little too much. Dawn is far more mature and self-guided than Buffy and the Scoobies were at her age.IMO, season seven is one of the poorer ones, exceeded only by season four in lack of interest. I put it behind season one despite that half-year's many flaws involving uneven writing and camera work. At least season one has youthful energy (and young actors), plus Angel and Cordelia. By season seven, everyone seems jaded by the whole thing. Maybe the show should have ended have season five after all, though there were indeed a number of great moments in season six and some in season seven that we then would never have been able to enjoy.",3,"Could have been better, could have been worse",1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,15126,"['long', 'review', 'numerous', 'spoilers.Various', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'much', 'what',

849478,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0002XVKMC,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[4, 8]","Finally, here it is: the end of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", taking our plotlines and characters full circle after seven wonderful, deep, sometimes flawed, but always watchable seasons. And though some may disagree, and although things may have been done better, I believe that Joss Whedon, the cast and crew successfully completed what they originally set out to do.Season Seven promises to `take us back to the beginning', and with the reopening of Sunnydale High School, the origins of the Slayer finally revealed, and the return of several past cast members, it certainly comes through on this promise. I'm certain there wasn't a fan out there that didn't have a geeky ""OMG, that's so cool!"" moment when we see a run-down of the past villains in the season premiere - it sent shivers down my spine.Soon we rejoin the Scooby gang as they come up against their first round of problems: Willow is back after recuperating in England over the summer, Spike is tormented by the presence of his newly-restored soul, Anya is grappling with her conscious after being remade a vengeance demon (and we finally see her origins in the earliest chronological flashback the show has ever had) and Buffy has eagerly accepted a job as a guidance councillor at the school, offered to her by the suave new Principal Robin Wood (who is, as you can probably guess, more than what he seems).But with the return of Giles, things begin to get stickier. Something is killing young girls all around the world, who turn out to be `Potential Slayers' - those who are next in line to gain Slayer-power should the present Slayer be killed. An elusive phrase floats around `from beneath you it devours'; as does a mysterious spectre that seems to know just which buttons to press in order to get the Scooby gang on the defensive. With a house full of young girls to babysit and train, as well as monstrous vampires, eyeless assassins, and a seemingly invincible preacher, Buffy assumes a tougher and more rigid standpoint than ever before - which hardly makes her very popular with the troops.Once again the old camaraderie between Xander/Buffy/Willow is back, as they cheerfully chatter and joke in the midst of doom and gloom (it's no coincidence that the worst seasons are the ones that have this friendship falter). The deep and abiding relationship between these three friends has always been the heart and soul of the show, and I defy anyone not to get a little teary when they say their goodbyes (cleverly disguised as casual banter) in the final episode, before their last fight.The First Evil genuinely comes across as a sinister and problematic villain, for how do you defeat an evil that is not only incorporeal, that can not only appear as any deceased loved one, but one who knows you intimately? It will help if you've seen ""Amends"" of Season Three, when this being first reared its head, but things sort itself out well enough if you haven't. The writers make the most of Its elusive shape-shifting powers, though right until the end I was holding out for Snyder, Jesse, Angelus, Ben (the intern that Giles killed), Darla, Tara and especially Jenny Calendar - can you imagine the potency of a scene between her and Giles? Unfortunately many of these actors were unavailable or had lost since moved on - but hey, a girl can dream can't she?Most importantly is the completion of the two major themes of the show: feminine empowerment and Buffy's incurable loneliness. The first is rather straightforward, but the second is something that has been the spirit of the show since the very beginning - no matter where Buffy turned she was trapped completely by her role as Slayer and her ongoing quest for a normal life. The problem seemed unsolvable and her dream unachievable - yet the genius of Joss Wheden finds a solution and brings our beloved heroine full circle. Her blissful, hopeful, joyful smile says it all.It was not perfect, as towards the end, things began to unravel a bit, with people, places and objects being introduced out of the blue without any real background, meaning, or wrap-up, such as a mystical Slayer-scythe, a female Guardian (who did what, exactly?), Amy the witch turns up again as a potential follower of the First but only appears in one episode, and several statements are made that aren't elaborated (mostly concerning the First's plans and the end of the Slayer line). Other major characters are shunted to the side (Dawn, Xander and Giles are given hardly anything to do) and by the end I was heartily sick and tired of the Spike/Buffy melodrama. Kennedy was a good, strong female character, but unfortunately was deemed unpopular due to her role as a Tara-replacement, and I was disappointed the father/daughter relationship between Buffy/Giles wasn't explicitly acknowledged between them.But for all of this, the good shone through: a range of allies (some of them rather surprising) turn up to help Buffy in her last battle, specifically Andrew and Faith who finally find redemption, some beautiful scenes of love and poignancy and the highest death rate of regular and re-occurring characters ever on the show. And we finally find out what happened to Miss Kitty Fantastico.Thanks Joss for seven amazing seasons, thank you for remembering what made this show special and honouring it, and thank you for Buffy, Giles, Xander and Willow - what truly amazing characters, and what a fantastic show.",4,"""The World is *Definitely* Doomed...""",1100822400,"11 19, 2004",2004,5417,"['Finally', 'here', 'end',

849479,A3559I6Q7RCPP3,B0002XVKMC,"Robert Cossaboon ""devil doll""","[6, 8]","Most of the fan consensus about Buffy Season 7 is that it petered out and ended on a stale note, especially in the very last scene where the remaining scoobies are cracking wise after having made it through a hellish battle and having seen some of their comrades and loved ones die.  Well, to borrow from Camus, there was more to admire about this season than to despise.  The good points:  Spike finally came off the bench and once more became a character of substance, instead of the paper tiger he had degenerated into over the past two seasons; Anya's character was given way more depth and angst this season, (Selfless was one of the standout episodes); Faith was back in the game-any episode with her has consistently been one of the season's best (see her return in Season 4 Angel, the two-parter in Season 4 Buffy); the new edition of principal Wood brought some nice ambiguity to many episodes; Caleb the preacher rocked-his nonchalant misogyny was truly spooky to behold; the many priceless moments-Anya's speech to Andrew about why she isn't running away this time (End of Days), the split-screen scene of everyone's obsessions of a nobody quarterback (Him), Spike's madness in the earlier episodes, and WillowWarren's supplication to Tara's spirit for forgiveness .  There were also some obvious shortcomings:  Andrew was a poor choice addition to the core group-he murdered in cold blood and for some reason the couple of tears he jerks passes for redemption in the Whedonverse and makes him a character to be cherished (Tom Lenk never came across as very funny to me, don't know what Whedon saw in him....); Dawn goes from being tolerable in Season 5 and snotty in Season 6 to making you wish for that medusa episode that never happened....; The First never lived up to its potential-I thought it was a brilliant idea to have it manifest itself into Buffy's previous villains, but aside from the first episode teaser, where were they?  Aside from one scene of the great Harry Groener interacting with Faith, all we got were Buffy, Spike and Druscilla; and what of the ubervamps?-how is it one of them can almost destroy Buffy and Spike, but by the series end it is almost like a bizarre musical the way everyone is casually dusting them?  To get the most from this season, take it on an episode-by-episode basis.  Standouts for me were:  Same Time, Same Place-the demon villain's voice in this episode is a true freak-out experience, as is the moment he manifests and goes to work on Willow; Selfless-the everything you ever wanted to know about Anya, but were too concerned with other things to ask episode with its own very unsettling resolution; Storyteller-this is the gimmick episode that has been a feature of the series since Season 4 (Hush, The Body, Once More With Feeling).  It has a Waldo Mittyesque charm that is wonderfully exploded in the climax.  You of course inevitably will have your own favorites, and just as inevitably you will come to the one inescapable conclusion of the season and the series as a whole:  it didn't suck.",4,This season at least doesn't suck,1101600000,"11 28, 2004",2004,3059,"['Most', 'fan', 'consensus', 'Buffy', 'Season', '7', 'petered', 'out', 'ended', 'stale', 'note', 'especially', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'where', 'remaining', 'scoobies', 'are', 'cracking', 'wise', 'having', 'made', 'hellish', 'battle', 'having', 'seen', 'comrades', 'loved', 'ones', 'die', 'Well', 'borrow', 'Camus', 'was', 'more', 'admire', 'season', 'despise', 'good', 'points', 'Spike', 'finally', 'came', 'off', 'bench', 'once', 'more', 'became', 'character', 'substance', 'instead', 'paper', 'tiger', 'had', 'degenerated', 'past', 'two', 'seasons', 'Anya', 'character', 'was', 'given', 'way', 'more', 'depth', 'angst', 'season', 'Selfless', 'was', 'one', 'standout', 'episodes', 'Faith', 'was', 'back', 'game-any', 'episode', 'consistently', 'been', 'one', 'season', 'best', 'see', 'return', 'Season', '4', 'Angel', 'two-parter', 'Season', '4', 'Buffy', 'new', 'edition', 'principal', 'Wood', 'brought', 'nice', 'ambiguity', 'many', 'episodes', 'Caleb', 'preacher', 'rocked-his', 'nonchalant', 'misogyny', 'was', 'truly', 'spooky', 'behold', 'many', 'priceless', 'moments-Anya', 'speech', 'Andrew', 'why', ""n't"", 'running', 'away', 'time', 'End', 'Days', 'split-screen', 'scene', 'everyone', 'obsessions', 'nobody', 'quarterback', 'Him', 'Spike', 'madness', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'WillowWarren', 'supplication', 'Tara', 'spirit', 'forgiveness', 'were', 'also', 'obvious', 'shortcomings', 'Andrew', 'was', 'poor', 'choice', 'addition', 'core', 'group-he', 'murdered', 'cold', 'blood', 'reason', 'couple', 'tears', 'passes', 'redemption', 'Whedonverse', 'character', 'be', 'cherished', 'Tom', 'Lenk', 'never', 'came', 'very', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Whedon', 'saw', 'Dawn', 'being', 'tolerable', 'Season', '5', 'snotty', 'Season', '6', 'making', 'wish', 'medusa', 'episode', 'never', 'happened', 'First', 'never', 'lived', 'up', 'potential-I', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'have', 'manifest', 'Buffy', 'previous', 'villains', 'aside', 'first', 'episode', 'teaser', 'where', 'were', 'Aside', 'one', 'scene', 'great', 'Harry', 'Groener', 'interacting', 'Faith', 'got', 'were', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'Druscilla', 'what', 'ubervamps', '-how', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'destroy', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'series', 'end', 'almost', 'bizarre', 'musical', 'way', 'everyone', 'casually', 'dusting', 'get', 'most', 'season', 'take', 'episode-by-episode', 'basis', 'Standouts', 'were', 'Same', 'Time', 'Same', 'Place-the', 'demon', 'villain', 'voice', 'episode', 'true', 'freak-out', 'experience', 'moment', 'work', 'Willow', 'Selfless-the', 'everything', 'ever', 'wanted', 'know', 'Anya', 'were', 'too', 'concerned', 'other', 'things', 'ask', 'episode', 'own', 'very', 'unsettling', 'resolution', 'Storyteller-this', 'gimmick', 'episode', 'been', 'feature', 'series', 'Season', '4', 'Hush', 'Body', 'Once', 'More', 'Feeling', 'Waldo', 'Mittyesque', 'charm', 'wonderfully', 'exploded', 'climax', 'course', 'inevitably', 'will', 'have', 'own', 'favorites', 'just', 'inevitably', 'will', 'come', 'one', 'inescapable', 'conclusion', 'season', 'series', 'whole', 'did', ""n't"", 'suck']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season
849480,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002XVKMC,Robert Moore,"[356, 391]","Unlike other seasons of BUFFY, one needs to defend either a low or high rating for this season.  One can take either of two tacks with Season Seven.  One could give it a low rating based on comparison with other seasons of BUFFY, because there is virtually no debate that this is the weakest season in the show's seven.  On this criterion, I would probably give the set a three-star rating.  On the other hand, one could base the rating not in comparison to BUFFY's other seasons, but to other shows, and on this basis I don't see how you can give the season anything less than a five.  Yes, it is BUFFY's weakest season; yes, there are some serious errors made during the season; yes, the writing isn't as sharp or as consistent.  Nonetheless, it was during the 2002-2003 television season, along with ANGEL (which had its own problems in its Season Four), FARSCAPE (which while superb was not as nearly sharp as Season Three), and ALIAS, among the finest shows on TV.  It is my least favorite season of BUFFY, but given the option of watching either it or any season of LAW AND ORDER or FRIENDS or CSI, I would choose Season Seven of BUFFY in a nanosecond.Warning:  Spoilers ahead.So why do BUFFY fans find Season Seven to be so disappointing.  I think there are a variety of reasons.  Here are a few:  1)  Although there is some very sharp humor during the season (e.g., a conversation about fast food delicacies between Spike and Andrew on a motorcycle, after which Spike warns that he will kill Andrew if he ever tells anyone about it; Anya's asking Andrew why he doesn't use the bathroom for the same purpose everyone else does [not the purpose one might first imagine]; and a phenomenal first encounter between Faith and Spike, when she doesn't know that he now fights on the side of the good guys, and tries to slay him, with the two of them debating on who has reformed and who did so first), the humor isn't as consistent.  But the tone of the series changed.  Even in Season Six, the show maintained a humorous tone most of the time.  In Season Seven, there is a constant attempt to inject a sense of impending doom, which unfortunately alters the show's mood in unpleasant fashion.  Buffy almost completely ceased her quipping.  2)  Although Sarah Michelle has gained a number of detractors since the end of the series (I think mainly for her lack of interaction with fans), I always think she did a marvelous job in the only crucial role on the show.  Unfortunately, in Season Seven she was asked to do something that her character wasn't well equipped to do:  more or less be a great leader.  Buffy in the first six seasons was always more of her own person, not quite a loner, but although the central figure in the Scoobies as the Slayer, not a leader either.  But in Season Seven after the Potentials arrive, she is asked to be a leader.  What is worse, she is asked to lead not merely by example but by giving morale-boosting speeches in every other episode.  Unfortunately, the speeches were horribly written and awkwardly inserted into the episodes.  I was more put off by her General Patton speeches more than I was by the notorious ""cookie dough"" speech she gives Angel in the final episode.  3) Worse of all, the Potentials completely altered the structure of the show.  I know many people simply didn't like the individual actresses portraying the Potentials, but to me that wasn't what was so bad about them.  Because there were so many of them, they gradually started eroding the screen time left to deal with the stories of the main Scoobies.  Actually, Season Seven is very good up to the episode when the Potential start arriving.  The episode where Anya slaughters as vengeance demon all the members of a fraternity, only to repent after failing to convince both others and herself that this was what she really wanted to be doing, and then walks off by herself at the end of the story is quite as good as what we had seen in the previous two or three seasons.  But once the Potentials arrived, there simply wasn't room or time to deals with individual characters any longer.  Xander, Anya, Dawn, and Giles more or less get squeezed out of the story.  Only Buffy, Willow, and Spike, and later in the year Faith, get to have their stories told at all.  In Seasons One through Six, four or five or six or seven was company, but twenty proved to be a crowd.  4) The lameness of The First as the Big Bad.  Cementing this was the terrible use of the great use of Nathan Fillion (who was spectacular as Mal Reynolds in FIREFLY) as Caleb.One other thing to lament about Season Seven was recently revealed by Joss Whedon, when he explained that they hoped to bring Tara back in Season Seven before contract negotiations broke down.  In an early episode, Buffy would somehow manage to gain the ability to make a single reality-altering wish.  Several alternatives are instantly imaginable:  wishing her mother back, lifting Angel's curse, perhaps not even being the Slayer.  Whedon imagined Buffy going to Willow and showing her new shoes, as if they were what she had used her wish for, Willow's incredulous reaction, and then Buffy telling her to look behind her, where Tara would have been standing.  Now that is an episode I would have liked to see.But sometimes the negatives seem to mask the large number of extremely good things in Season Seven.  For instance:  1) Except for ""Him"" (where Buffy and Dawn fight over the attentions of the same high school student) there were no out and out from beginning to end bad episodes.  The bad stuff largely took place within a show that features some good things.  2) A few absolutely stunning individual episodes, especially ""Conversations with Dead People,"" the hysterical ""The Storyteller"" (centering on Andrew, who provided many of the funniest moments of Season Seven, and who is one of the odds on favorites to be in any BUFFY/ANGEL spin off), and the great episode where Spike deals with unresolved conflicts concerning his mother.  3) The struggles of both Willow and Spike in dealing with their respective inner demons, Willow with having killed in Season Six and Spike with his having a soul.  4) The return of Faith, which while BUFFY did not provide her with as many great moments as ANGEL did for three episodes preceding her return to Sunnydale, were great.  The tremendous chemistry (more as kindred spirits than sexual) between Spike and Faith, especially in a long conversation they have in Buffy's basement, one of the highpoints of the season, has many people hoping for the demise of TRU CALLING (Eliza Dushku's current and lightly regarded show) so that Faith and Spike can head a spin off.Then there is the ending.  Many hate it.  Many love it.  Personally, I think it was a perfect end to the series.  BUFFY was always a fictional representation about the empowerment of women.  In the climax of the season-and indeed, the climax of the entire series-Buffy with Willow's help discovers a way to empower not merely the Chosen One, the lone Slayer, but all potential slayers, all over the world.  Best of all, the show managed to resolve Buffy's central dilemma that was established in Season One and continued through to the end:  How could she, whom fate had selected to be The Chosen One, ever manage to live the kind of life she dreamed of having?  By empowering all potentials, and in effect creating dozens and perhaps hundreds of Slayers, Buffy ceased to be The Chose One.  In the final seconds of the show, Faith says to Buffy ""Yeah, you're not the one and only chosen anymore. Just gotta live like a person. How's that feel?""  It seems to take a second before the question hits her, but when it does, you can almost feel Buffy's relief, and her face lights up with an extraordinarily happy smile.  You can feel her relief at having triumphed over her fate.I can't imagine a more perfect ending to what I honestly feel is the finest television series in the history of television.",5,Let me explain

849482,A27XLRTG0ZIDNO,B0002XVKMC,"Roy ""mmm_chicken""","[6, 8]","I first watched Buffy towards the end of the now classic second season. I was struck by how well written and exciting it was. There really was nothing else like it on television. However, the station that carried Buffy all of a sudden stopped carrying it and it wasn't until the first season was released on DVD that I really got into the show. I now own all seasons of Buffy and I can say that it is by far the best show I have ever watched. No show, or movie for that matter, mixes several genres together so seamlessly and perfectly. The villains, the heroes, all of them were terrific. Now that the show is over and I have no more new episodes to look forward to, I realize how much I am going to miss this show.I prefer not to focus on the few faults this season had. Yes, it was not ""perfect"", but I would rather focus on the many things the series did right this season. The First was a great villain because it could be any dead person it wanted to be. This brought back all of the Big Bads of seasons past and also gave SMG a chance to show off her villainous side in the scenes where the First was Buffy. Caleb was also a great villain. He brought something extra to the last few episodes. The returns of Faith and Andrew were highlights. Those two are two of my favorite characters and it was great to see them utilized in the final season. Amy's brief return was great as well. I think the motto of the season was to see how horribly things could go wrong and how many people could be killed off, since this season has a VERY high body count. This season was the perfect showcase for SMG. Her acting was pitch-perfect and spot-on the entire season. Anyone who says she cannot act is a damn fool and this season proves it, hell every season of Buffy proves it. Every person on this show can act and if there is any justice they will still be working even though the show is over.Now on the final episode, Chosen. This is, in my opinion, the best Buffy episode ever. It's mix of drama, action, comedy, romance, and heartbreak is everything Buffy stands for. I have never cried so much as I did in the last quarter of this episode. I don't want to give away the most surprising death for people like me who relied on the DVD sets to watch the show, but this person was my favorite character and it was a shock to see them go so quickly and suddenly. I wish they could have survived but that is what I love about this show: any character can go, no matter how popular they are. The final twist with the scythe was excellent, and the last shot of Buffy is just spectacular. Simply put, this is the best series finale I have ever watched. It left me wanting more, and that is how one of the best shows ever created should leave--with a bang, not a whimper (although if you don't do some whimpering during this episode you are made of stronger stuff than I).I highly recommend this DVD collection. Buffy is an excellent show and there will never be another show like it. Even though Buffy is over, the show will live on through these DVDs, because most of the episodes are highly rewatchable and entertaining all over again. Do yourself a favor and get this set, you will not regret it.",5,A spectacular ending to an excellent series,1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,3191,"['first', 'watched', 'Buffy', 'end', 'now', 'classic', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'well', 'written', 'exciting', 'was', 'really', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'television', 'However', 'station', 'carried', 'Buffy', 'sudden', 'stopped', 'carrying', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'season', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'really', 'got', 'show', 'now', 'own', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'can', 'say', 'far', 'best', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'show', 'movie', 'matter', 'mixes', 'several', 'genres', 'together', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'perfectly', 'villains', 'heroes', 'were', 'terrific', 'Now', 'show', 'have', 'more', 'new', 'episodes', 'look', 'forward', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'am', 'going', 'miss', 'show.I', 'prefer', 'not', 'focus', 'few', 'faults', 'season', 'had', 'Yes', 'was', 'not', 'perfect', 'would', 'rather', 'focus', 'many', 'things', 'series', 'did', 'right', 'season', 'First', 'was', 'great', 'villain', 'could', 'be', 'dead', 'person', 'wanted', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'Big', 'Bads', 'seasons', 'past', 'also', 'gave', 'SMG', 'chance', 'show', 'off', 'villainous', 'side', 'scenes', 'where', 'First', 'was', 'Buffy', 'Caleb', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'villain', 'brought', 'something', 'extra', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'returns', 'Faith', 'Andrew', 'were', 'highlights', 'two', 'are', 'two', 'favorite', 'characters', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'utilized', 'final', 'season', 'Amy', 'brief', 'return', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'motto', 'season', 'was', 'see', 'how', 'horribly', 'things', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'be', 'killed', 'off', 'season', 'VERY', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'season', 'was', 'perfect', 'showcase', 'SMG', 'acting', 'was', 'pitch-perfect', 'spot-on', 'entire', 'season', 'Anyone', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'damn', 'fool', 'season', 'hell', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Every', 'person', 'show', 'can', 'act', 'justice', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'working', 'even', 'show', 'over.Now', 'final', 'episode', 'Chosen', 'opinion', 'best', 'Buffy', 'episode', 'ever', 'mix', 'drama', 'action', 'comedy', 'romance', 'heartbreak', 'everything', 'Buffy', 'have', 'never', 'cried', 'so', 'much', 'did', 'last', 'quarter', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'most', 'surprising', 'death', 'people', 'who', 'relied', 'DVD', 'sets', 'watch', 'show', 'person', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'shock', 'see', 'go', 'so', 'quickly', 'suddenly', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'what', 'love', 'show', 'character', 'can', 'go', 'matter', 'how', 'popular', 'are', 'final', 'twist', 'scythe', 'was', 'excellent', 'last', 'shot', 'Buffy', 'just', 'spectacular', 'Simply', 'put', 'best', 'series', 'finale', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'how', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'created', 'should', 'leave', 'bang', 'not', 'whimper', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'whimpering', 'episode', 'are', 'made', 'stronger', 'stuff', '.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Buffy', 'excellent', 'show', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'show', 'Even', 'Buffy', 'show', 'will', 'live', 'DVDs', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'highly', 'rewatchable', 'entertaining', 'over', 'again', 'Do', 'favor', 'get', 'set', 'will', 'not', 'regret']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

Not because they were there, just because they took time away from other characters (where the hell was Xander this season?) The Big Bad was a great last villian because if you're going to go out on top, you should have the first original evil to battle, right? I loved Buffy and Spike's relationship this season. It was built on trust, not on lust. I actually liked the character of Kennedy. Sure, she's no Tara, but Willow needed her and she was great for her in that aspect. I kind of wished they would have focused some more on Xander and Anya's relationship. We had 'Selfless' which was wonderful, and then we see them as buddies. Later on, their relationship seems built on sex, not love. It was nice to have Giles back for a good portion of the season. I loved how Buffy no longer needed a watcher, and they spent most of their time on different pages. This season was really about power. Buffy's got it and still isn't respected for it. After she is kicked out of the house, they realize just how much they need her. Caleb was an interesting villian. I liked how this season was all about girl power so it was appropriate to have a female hating villian. Well, Buffy sure showed him, huh? It was great to see some familiar faces. Faith returns for the final few episodes after helping out Angel in L.A. We see the Mayor, Drusilla, Warren, Glory, and the Master all in the form on the First. What can I say about the last episode? It was truly amazing. I remember when it first aired, I cried so hard during the second half I couldn't even hear what was happening. Thank God for VCR's and recording. There was so much to wrap up in that final episode. We got a visit from Angel and an explosive battle down in the Hellmouth. The best part of the episode is the throw-back to the first season, when Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles were the original gang. Friendship has always been a huge theme in this show and it's amazing to see everyone's transformation from season one to seven. The twist ending was amazing as well: using the power of the scythe to make every potential a slayer... Brilliant. The last shot of the entire series is just perfect.

849490,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B0002XVKMC,Sean Pasek,"[0, 0]","**SPOILER ALERT**It was obvious that Joss Whedon was going to make sure that Buffy the Vampire Slayer went out with a bang.  And it did.  One of the tragedies of television shows is when a series has started to run out of steam, and instead of a series ending things on its own while it is still on top, it waits until there isn't much left, and it falls victim to low-ratings scenario.I can't think of many television series that went out when it was still a high-quality show.  Typically the strength of a show rests with its writers.  As long as the stories are still strong, the show thrives.While I still feel that Season 2 was arguably the best season for the show, no one can deny the strength of the show's climactic season.So, the season's storyline this time isn't just about Buffy fighting demons and vampires.  It's about her fighting the reason that they exist at all: evil.  First Evil, to be exact.  We were given a glimpse of the First (as it is referred to by the characters) back in Season 3.In many ways, and as the first episode eludes to, the show comes full circle.  We're back at the high school, even though it has been rebuilt after it was more or less obliterated back at the end of Season 3.Joss Whedon is one of the most talented writers in the business.  As a producer and creator, he is exceptional with great tongue-and-cheek dialogue and characterization.  Each character in the Buffy universe has many layers, and perhaps that is a reason that many of them are some of the most memorable characters in recent television history.  While Whedon can utilize humor and action, he can also tap into the hearts of the viewers with some touching and very poignant moments.  I think that in the episode ""Touched"" the scene where Spike shares his true feelings of how he perceives Buffy is absolutely beautiful.  I don't know of many women who wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of those words.  But, in many ways, Spike sums up what we also feel and hold for Buffy, which is probably why the truth of which he speaks strikes such a powerful chord.The Season is about so many things:Willow has to learn how to deal with the consequences of what she did in the last season.  How is she able to balance her power with control?  Because she now understands what she is capable of, and it scares her.  At the beginning of the season, even the viewer isn't entirely sure of what to make of her.Xander has ever been the character to provide wit and humor during tough times.  But, he has also always been the character who ""sees"" everything.  He has the luxury of being outside the circle to a degree, which gives him the ability to see into the hearts of the other characters.  And because he never shys away from speaking his mind, he invariably passes off some incredible wisdom and insight to his friends.Spike embodies what it means to be a true hero; to resurrect himself to become a better man.  At one point, Buffy ""crowns"" him her champion.  I don't know any other character that epitomizes that more than Spike.  As we know, Angel already reclaimed his soul when he encounters Buffy at the beginning of the series. Spike undergoes the radical transformation and undertakes the incredible task of rebuilding the bridge of trust with Buffy that he destroys in the last season.The other characters round out the cast nicely.  Anya undergoes her own transformation when she realizes that she cannot go back to her old life.  Dawn finds ways to contribute, and in many ways like Xander, she is among the most selfless of the characters.Andrew, wonderfully played by Tom Lenk, provides some great humorous moments.  In nearly every scene he's in, there is something to laugh at.  He takes ""geekdom"" to its ulimate level, and Andrew has to find a way to tap into his own courage.Much of what occurs in this season is referenced back to all of the other seasons throughout the run of the show.  Season 7 transcends the six before it, as our beloved characters finally cross over from teenagers into adults.Overall, this is one of the best television series.  It has everything...action, drama, comedy, memorable characters, great stories, and it never takes itself too seriously, even though there are plenty of serious and even touching moments.  The  final battle scenes from ""Chosen"" the last episode, are fantastic, especially along with the incredible musical score that seems to sum up everything that the show is, which is why it is truly epic.Perhaps, with all of this, Whedon perfectly closes out the series with a question from Willow.

849491,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B0002XVKMC,S.E. Poza,"[4, 8]","The final season of Buffy parallels the 5th season in that both seemed to have been mapped out pretty well to tell one continuous story in most of the episodes (with a few exceptions).The basic premise of the last season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was that ""the First Evil"" was prepared to bring about an apocalypse (in the Buffy universe, the apocalypse isn't something that comes only once). The premise was good, the build-up was good, and the pay-off in the end was fine. The only major problem was that too much was crammed in too quickly and the last season felt rushed. Also, the one-off episodes (what few there were), were not very good, particularly ""Him"".Compared to previous seasons, many of the characters experienced reasonable emotional growth (particularly Buffy, Faith, Spike, and Xander). There were a few character-based blunders though which seemed to be excuses for extra love scenes. The relationship between Willow and Kennedy was forced and seemed merely an excuse to show two women kissing as much as possible. It isn't that Willow should have become a nun after her former lover died but rather that there was not enough chemistry between the actresses/characters to believe in instant passion and no exploration of a personality-based link. This was a storyline that the show should simply have not pursued and it would have allowed for more time for other stories and made the season feel less rushed.A lot of fans hated the final season compared to other seasons but a lot of that was because of the viewers' individual idiosyncracies based on their emotional identification with and projection upon various characters That is to say, they were upset when the characters didn't do, say, and have happen to them what they wanted to have happen to them. A viewer who lacks these sorts of expectations of the characters and who is focussing on the storylines, dialog (which is quite well-written), and characters who you feel for (rather than feel about), will find the entire season quite entertaining.",4,Well-written season-long arc,1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,2030,"['final', 'season', 'Buffy', '5th', 'season', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'mapped', 'out', 'pretty', 'well', 'tell', 'one', 'continuous', 'story', 'most', 'episodes', 'few', 'exceptions', '.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'last', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'was', 'First', 'Evil', 'was', 'prepared', 'bring', 'about', 'apocalypse', 'Buffy', 'universe', 'apocalypse', ""n't"", 'something', 'only', 'once', 'premise', 'was', 'good', 'build-up', 'was', 'good', 'pay-off', 'end', 'was', 'fine', 'only', 'major', 'problem', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'crammed', 'too', 'quickly', 'last', 'season', 'felt', 'rushed', 'Also', 'one-off', 'episodes', 'what', 'few', 'were', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'particularly', 'Him', '.Compared', 'previous', 'seasons', 'many', 'characters', 'experienced', 'reasonable', 'emotional', 'growth', 'particularly', 'Buffy', 'Faith', 'Spike', 'Xander', 'were', 'few', 'character-based', 'blunders', 'seemed', 'be', 'excuses', 'extra', 'love', 'scenes', 'relationship', 'Willow', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'forced', 'seemed', 'merely', 'excuse', 'show', 'two', 'women', 'kissing', 'as', 'much', 'possible', ""n't"", 'Willow', 'should', 'have', 'become', 'nun', 'former', 'lover', 'died', 'rather', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'chemistry', 'actresses/characters', 'believe', 'instant', 'passion', 'exploration', 'personality-based', 'link', 'was', 'storyline', 'show', 'should', 'simply', 'have', 'not', 'pursued', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'more', 'time', 'other', 'stories', 'made', 'season', 'feel', 'rushed.A', 'lot', 'fans', 'hated', 'final', 'season', 'compared', 'other', 'seasons', 'lot', 'was', 'viewers', 'individual', 'idiosyncracies', 'based', 'emotional', 'identification', 'projection', 'various', 'characters', 'say', 'were', 'upset', 'when', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'say', 'have', 'happen', 'what', 'wanted', 'have', 'happen', 'viewer', 'who', 'sorts', 'expectations', 'characters', 'who', 'focussing', 'storylines', 'dialog', 'quite', 'well-written', 'characters', 'who', 'feel', 'rather', 'feel', 'will', 'find', 'entire', 'season', 'quite', 'entertaining']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

849495,AMNJJ9VAQEA86,B0002XVKMC,Spunk Monkey,"[10, 16]","Lets get things nice and sparkling clear- from a number of reviews written on Amazon, I was fully prepared for a lesser Buffy season, one which was subpar but ""better than just about anything else on television."" This is simply balderdash.I have purchased every season of Buffy on DVD and, accordingly, the reviews for any given season say that that particular season is one that is a ""universally agreed upon lesser season"" though still ""better than just about blah blah ti dah.""There is nothing lesser about this season and it is just as fantastic as every other season and, with the possible exception of the very first season, I would argue that there is no single BEST season. It would be absolutly impossible to quantify such as thing for every season has masterful episodes.Here are some of the most common complaints and complainers spanning the various seasons:Season 1- Too monster of the week with intsy tinsy seasonal arc.The master was a Big Bad Minus. The characters are all stereotypish and thinly portrayed.Season 2- Starts out abit too much like season 1. There are the Why can't Willow and Xander get togethers, Why can't Angel be gooders, and why can't Buffy and Angel get togetherers?Season 3- There are the They brought Angel back to life Come on now Cheap cheapers. Faith is a hosebagers. Xander and Cordillia hookin up pinheads.Season 4- Most people complained about the initiative and hate Riley. Then there are the Oz lamentors and Tara seethers. Angels missers. Spike chip freakers.Season 5- Dawn despisers. Major plot hole mania pointer outers (A mystical key, to a portal, which opened up the dimensions, with blood, but when it stopped it would shut, but Buffy had the same blood...hmm, ahh huh wha?). Giles is a capitalist pig  anticapitalists.Season 6- Oh boo hoo too depressing. Buffy and Spike sexcapade hating Angel puritans. Giles is gone crybabies. The nerds were weak ass villans expounders. Buffy should have stayed dead psychopaths. Whats this crap about heaven atheists. Xander and Anya should have tied it depth charges. Evil Willow cognisent dissonances.Season 7- The ""The potentials were all winy [...]. Tara didn't rise from the deaders. Why did the main characters have to die ers. The ending suckers. Kennedy mashers. The excess phlabatinum wretchers. The Why are the Ubervampires so varying in kill quality pointer outers and so on.For every conceivable development in the story, for every nook and every cranny, there are people that complain and rant and rave and yack and scribble.In every season of Buffy there were some episodes that were sublime, and then some that were fantiastic, and then some that were just great.In every season of Buffy there were developments that were pleasing, some that were heartbreaking, or some that were just plain necessary. Like the song says, ""You can't always get what you want...you get what you need.""For every season of Buffy, there were plot holes and then there was masterful narrative arcs, self reflexivity and the odd abandoned story thread.What are my gripes and complaints about the final season of Buffy? Who cares. This is fantastic voyage brought to a truly satisfying conclusion. Any fan of Buffy should know that these artists could be trusted to guide this ship. All one hundred and fourty four episodes combine into one giant epic narrative about love, hate, dead, life, redemption, forgiveness, growth, loyalty, leadership, loss, meaning, defeat, and dimensions without shrimp to create one of the greatest stories of empowerment of the (post)modern age. And did I mention its fun too, and funny, and weepy, and romantic and action packed.Buffy rules. Enjoy the final season and make up your own mind about its quality. I, for one, would say that it was shiny!Oh, I do have one complaint about Buffy. O.K. 2. One, in season one, after Xander turned into a hyena, he said he was going vegitarian. So for six seasons, he was a vegitarian in my mind (I am a vegan), then during Double Meat Palace (Season 6) Xander ate a hamburger. I was pissed- but they later had Prinicpal Wood as vegi so they barely squeezed in a representin'. And 2, they never had Anya watch the killer giant bunny rabbit movie ""Night of the Lepus.""

849497,AJ02IW0YNCS3B,B0002XVKMC,Stephen Ebrey,"[11, 15]","Buffy may be one of the funniest TV series ever made, but it's also the most depressing.  How does a series maintain coherence when it ranges from screwball comedy to episodes that are artsier and darker than anything ever shown on HBO?  By focusing on it's main characters - Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles - through all the comedy, tragedy, and action.  These characters share the same traits that made Tony Soprano so famous: they are the most charming people you'll ever see, and yet can do truly despicable things.  It feels like the writers became bored of the main characters in the last season, which should be a year that reinforces what makes the series great, not deviate from it.Xander's role in this season is a joke compared to the previous six.  Buffy spends most of the year giving incredibly annoying lectures.  Giles completely contradicts his growth over the previous six seasons: while he learned to let Buffy stand on her own over the past few years, now he's stabbing her in the back.  As for Willow... while the exploration of her guilt about season 6 is interesting, her new girlfriend is so annoying that I didn't enjoy many of her scenes.The reason for Xander (and Anya's, and Dawn's) reduced screen time, and Buffy's annoyingness, is a group of potential slayers that take over Buffy's house.  None of them establish real personalities, not even Kennedy, the one who becomes Willow's girlfriend.  Nonetheless, a huge amount of time is spent either on the Potentials whining, or Buffy lecturing them, neither of which provides humor, or character development, or anything else you might be watching Buffy for.So who DOES have a good character arc?  Andrew is absolutely fantastic.  He's hilarious, and he grows as a person over the year, just like the main characters used to on Buffy.  The problem is... Andrew is not who Buffy is about.  There are great seasons of Buffy without Andrew, but none without Buffy, Willow, or Xander.Spike's character arc is also worth watching, except for a short period where he is brainwashed into being evil again.  The entire point of Spike's character is that he does everything for the women he loves, whether it's writing bad poetry, trying to destroy the world, or trying to save it.  A brainwashed Spike isn't Spike.The good thing about season 7 is that the worst episodes are all strung together in the middle of the season.  If you skip everything after ""Conversations with Dead People"" and before ""Storyteller"" you end up with a decent half season of Buffy.  While Buffy's own actions are mostly uninteresting this season, a vampire's analysis of her in ""Conversations"" is hilarious and yet shockingly deep.The last few episodes feature the return of Faith, who finally learns relationships can be about more than sex, a few funny scenes with a jealous Angel, and the appearance of Caleb, a neat villain played by Nathan Fillion.  This definitely rejuvenated my interest in the season, but other than showing that Buffy can pimp two vampires at the same time, it hardly made this an important year for the main characters.Some people lump this season in with 6, which I strongly disagree with.  They're both a little rough around the edges - Joss Whedon only directed one episode of each, the amazing Buffy composer Chris Beck didn't do the music for either, and Anthony Stewart Head wanted Giles to be only a recurring character for both.  But there's one huge, glaring difference between 6 and 7: 6 is the most Buffy-Willow-Xander focused of all the seasons of Buffy, while 7 is the least.  6 introduced fewer new characters than any other season of Buffy, 7 introduced the most.  6 wasn't funny because it was telling a tragic story, while 7 wasn't funny because the writers weren't giving jokes to anyone but Andrew.",3,"By far the worst season of Buffy, though it has its moments",1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,3791,"['Buffy', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'TV', 'series', 'ever', 'made', 'also', 'most', 'depressing', 'How', 'series', 'maintain', 'coherence', 'when', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'episodes', 'are', 'artsier', 'darker', 'anything', 'ever', 'shown', 'HBO', 'focusing', 'main', 'characters', 'Buffy', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'Giles', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'action', 'characters', 'share', 'same', 'traits', 'made', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'so', 'famous', 'are', 'most', 'charming', 'people', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'yet', 'can', 'do', 'truly', 'despicable', 'things', 'writers', 'became', 'bored', 'main', 'characters', 'last', 'season', 'should', 'be', 'year', 'what', 'series', 'great', 'not', 'deviate', 'it.Xander', 'role', 'season', 'joke', 'compared', 'previous', 'six', 'Buffy', 'most', 'year', 'giving', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'lectures', 'Giles', 'completely', 'growth', 'previous', 'six', 'seasons', 'learned', 'let', 'Buffy', 'stand', 'own', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'stabbing', 'back', 'Willow', 'exploration', 'guilt', 'season', '6', 'interesting', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'so', 'annoying', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'many', 'scenes.The', 'reason', 'Xander', 'Anya', 'Dawn', 'reduced', 'screen', 'time', 'Buffy', 'annoyingness', 'group', 'potential', 'slayers', 'take', 'Buffy', 'house', 'None', 'establish', 'real', 'personalities', 'not', 'even', 'Kennedy', 'one', 'who', 'Willow', 'girlfriend', 'Nonetheless', 'huge', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'either', 'Potentials', 'whining', 'Buffy', 'lecturing', 'humor', 'character', 'development', 'anything', 'else', 'might', 'be', 'watching', 'Buffy', 'for.So', 'who', 'have', 'good', 'character', 'arc', 'Andrew', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'hilarious', 'person', 'year', 'just', 'main', 'characters', 'used', 'Buffy', 'problem', 'Andrew', 'not', 'who', 'Buffy', 'about', 'are', 'great', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'Andrew', 'none', 'Buffy', 'Willow', 'Xander.Spike', 'character', 'arc', 'also', 'worth', 'watching', 'short', 'period', 'where', 'brainwashed', 'being', 'evil', 'again', 'entire', 'point', 'Spike', 'character', 'everything', 'women', 'writing', 'bad', 'poetry', 'trying', 'destroy', 'world', 'trying', 'save', 'brainwashed', 'Spike', ""n't"", 'Spike.The', 'good', 'thing', 'season', '7', 'worst', 'episodes', 'are', 'strung', 'together', 'middle', 'season', 'skip', 'everything', 'Conversations', 'Dead', 'People', 'Storyteller', 'end', 'up', 'decent', 'half', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Buffy', 'own', 'actions', 'are', 'mostly', 'uninteresting', 'season', 'vampire', 'analysis', 'Conversations', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'shockingly', 'deep.The', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'feature', 'return', 'Faith', 'who', 'finally', 'relationships', 'can', 'be', 'about', 'more', 'sex', 'few', 'funny', 'scenes', 'jealous', 'Angel', 'appearance', 'Caleb', 'neat', 'villain', 'played', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'definitely', 'rejuvenated', 'interest', 'season', 'other', 'showing', 'Buffy', 'can', 'pimp', 'two', 'vampires', 'same', 'time', 'hardly', 'made', 'important', 'year', 'main', 'characters.Some', 'people', 'lump', 'season', '6', 'strongly', 'disagree', ""'re"", 'little', 'rough', 'edges', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'only', 'directed', 'one', 'episode', 'amazing', 'Buffy', 'composer', 'Chris', 'Beck', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'music', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'wanted', 'Giles', 'be', 'only', 'recurring', 'character', 'one', 'huge', 'glaring', 'difference', '6', '7', '6', 'most', 'Buffy-Willow-Xander', 'focused', 'seasons', 'Buffy', '7', 'least', '6', 'introduced', 'fewer', 'new', 'characters', 'other', 'season', 'Buffy', '7', 'introduced', 'most', '6', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'was', 'telling', 'tragic', 'story', '7', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'writers', 'were', ""n't"", 'giving', 'jokes', 'anyone', 'Andrew']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

As usual season 7 ends with an apocalypse but safe to say it's the mother of all apocalypses! By this season the main characters were fully developed and fleshed out and I would want them for my friends too. I highly recommend this season as well as the others too, as usual Buffy triumphs in the end and the world is saved but not without loss! It you're new to this series I recommend you start with season 1, the whole series is available on Amazon Prime for free to members and is worth a look.

I was just so terribly dissappointed here... i actually shut off the DVD player a few times. It was HARD to watch how the writers were ending these characters. It didn't seem like I was watching buffy anymore.  Nothing was the same this time. I am the biggest fan of Buffy. I fell in love with season one. I was hooked from the start.  By the time i purchased seasons 2 and 3 i thought the writing and acting was far surperior than most shows around. I LOVED seasons 5 * 6 -- no compliants.  Where oh WHERE in the HECK did the writers send these characters too in season 7?  IT was all over the board in season 7.  There was NO CORE group at all....BAD story lines .. BORING BORING episodes...so hard to watch at times. I am APPAULED at Willow's handling of TARA'S death/memory.  In retro spect it was the MOST INCONSISTANT storyline of season 7.  Here is why .. season six ended with DARK WILLOW .. why was she DARK --- because TARA died.  So wouldn't it stand to reason she really loved tara and was in soo much pain she almost destroyed the world. How then in season 7 can she just jump so fast into a new relationship and act so ANTI WILLOW----it was like watching a different show. Willow was my favorite character .. but NOT in season 7. Here is another TERRIBLE story ending....Anya Dies ..and all Zander says is ""that's my girl"" .. with a smile on his face??? PLEASE !!! PLEASE !!!  GARBAGE.  I would liked to have seen more of the CORE characters have more scenes and episodes pulling them together .. since this was the LAST season. They brought FAITH back .. which was the highlight .. and I feel it was wasted. There wasn't that spark there as in Season Three.  I feel at no fault to the actors.  They are awesome ..it's the HORRIBLE writing!  And those STUPID ""slayer girls"" ...BUFFY had more conversations with random girls .. then she did with Willow or zander ect.  *~~* oh well ~* buffy is STILL the BEST TV show ever.  It did have an awesome battle scene at the end ~* and the musical score was HOT!!!! ~*~* I give every other season 5 stars .. but Season 7 was a let down for a fan like me!  I hope you can watch and enjoy it though!!  Maybe I am just sentimental and wantd to see more closeness between main characters !! xoxo",1,SO  SAD IT ENDED LIKE THIS ....

I laughed at this every episode, and thought a drinking game is soon to be born,it was almost like the writers wanted us to loathe Buffy for some reason for putting everyone in danger.4.OH MY GOD!!! they turned on Buffy MUTINY!! the payoff from the gee is Buffy really that stupid? Episodes, but by next episode it's all ok friends again, god talk about the worst build up for nothing ever..had to be one of the WORST plotlines that went nowhere the whole season, it seemed it was all for a stupid Spuffy moment just a total waste of episodes.These are just my views,some people loved both season 6 and 7, though it your a old school Buffy fan, and love the scooby gang of Buffy,Xander,Giles and Willow you will be disappointed and probably sad that this last season gave little to them, the characters that started it all..",2,What do Buffy season 7 and the Titanic have in common?,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,3287,"['started', 'out', 'great', 'ended', 'up', 'sinking', 'midway', 'season', '6', 'Buffy', 'turned', 'hero', 'S', 'M', 'loving', 'lost', 'heaven', 'depressed', 'Buffy', 'even', 'Gellar', 'hated', 'season', 'Mutant', 'Enemy', 'promised', 'fans', 'season', '7', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'basics', 'give', 'everyone', 'Buffy', 'kicks', 'bad', 'guy', 'butt', 'funny', 'puns', 'old', 'seemed', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'just', 'Buffy', 'got', 'new', 'job', 'seemed', 'have', 'love', 'friends', 'family', 'vibe', 'going', 'Xander', 'Dawn', 'first', 'episode', 'season', '7', 'came', 'depression', 'got', 'old', 'enemy', 'back', 'could', 'take', 'form', 'dead', 'was', 'apparentaly', 'wiping', 'out', 'potential', 'slayers', 'world.Spike', 'looked', 'might', 'fall', 'back', 'cocky', 'Master', 'Vamp', 'old', 'well', 'power', 'First', 'Evil', 'Spike', 'turned', 'Love', 'Buffy', 'wussy', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'old', 'Spike', 'back', 'was', 'villian', 'ranked', 'up', 'there', 'Mayor', 'funny', 'evil', 'same', 'time', 'who', 'could', 'forget', 'First', 'act', 'doing', 'Buffy', 'Rogue', 'Gallery', 'chilling', 'looked', 'season', '7', 'was', 'speculated', 'last', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'bang.Then', 'something', 'happened', 'sudden', 'writers', 'gave', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore', 'style', 'writing', 'packed', 'show', 'tons', 'potential', 'slayers', 'other', 'last', 'minute', 'characters', 'did', 'nothing', 'eat', 'up', 'screen', 'time', 'original', 'cast', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'season', 'be', 'full', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'last', 'season', 'things', 'disappointed', 'season', '7.1.Total', 'lack', 'screen', 'time', 'original', 'characters', 'everyone', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'lot', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'even', 'Xander', 'was', 'totally', 'written', 'Converstations', 'Dead', 'People', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'Xander', 'guilt', 'trip', 'Jesse', 'moment', 'also', 'think', 'whole', 'return', 'Giles', 'was', 'totally', 'mishandled', 'first', 'was', 'laughable.2.Dropped', 'plotpoints', 'storylines', 'went', 'nowhere', 'most', 'episodes', 'seem', 'be', 'just', 'written', 'cuff', 'what', 'seemed', 'important', 'fact', 'was', 'totally', 'lost', 'next', 'episode', 'writers', 'had', 'outline', 'were', 'just', 'writing', 'anything.3.Did', 'bring', 'back', 'Buffy', 'forget', 'brain', 'moments', 'episodes', 'regarding', 'Spike', 'Buffy', 'finding', 'out', 'Spike', 'might', 'be', 'control', 'First', 'let', 'run', 'free', 'unchecked', 'kept', 'going', 'soullllllll', 'now', 'many', 'times', 'thought', 'yeah', 'so', 'did', 'Hitler', 'what', 'point', 'laughed', 'episode', 'thought', 'drinking', 'game', 'soon', 'be', 'born', 'was', 'almost', 'writers', 'wanted', 'loathe', 'Buffy', 'reason', 'putting', 'everyone', 'danger.4.OH', 'MY', 'GOD', 'turned', 'Buffy', 'MUTINY', 'payoff', 'gee', 'Buffy', 'really', 'stupid', 'Episodes', 'next', 'episode', 'ok', 'friends', 'again', 'god', 'talk', 'worst', 'build', 'up', 'nothing', 'ever..had', 'be', 'one', 'WORST', 'plotlines', 'went', 'nowhere', 'whole', 'season', 'seemed', 'was', 'stupid', 'Spuffy', 'moment', 'just', 'total', 'waste', 'episodes.These', 'are', 'just', 'views', 'people', 'loved', 'season', '6', '7', 'old', 'school', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'love', 'scooby', 'gang', 'Buffy', 'Xander', 'Giles', 'Willow', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'probably', 'sad', 'last', 'season', 'gave', 'little', 'characters', 'started', 'all..']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

The original four members of the inner circle reunite for a climactic 7th and final season of this excellent series. We see Spike crazy in the rebuilt Sunnydale High basement after regaining his soul. We see the introduction of Principal Robin Wood, a man with a dark past and a grudge against the bleach blonde William The Bloody. We continue the story arch of Willow's apprehension with her magics. Also new to this season are the Potential Slayers who arrive in droves trying to escape a villain not seen since the 3rd season, The First Evil. We can revel in the return of many of our favorite Buffy villains from seasons past. Even Jonathon who had a much smaller role in the beginning of the series comes full circle and is killed by Andrew. Willow gets a new love in Potential Slayer, Kennedy(Iyari Limon)and the couple of Xander and Anya come to the realization of where their love truly is. We lose two main characters in the series finale, Spike(who goes over to Angel) and Anya. We stare in awe as Angel makes his final cameo appearance in a Buffy episode. We react with caution as the rouge Slayer known as Faith returns to help Buffy and the Scoobies defeat The First and it's lap dog, a renegade preacher named Caleb. And fans of the series will notice that one of Chosen's scenes resembles the end of The Harvest from season 1. Now the series in it's entirety can be owned on DVD so buy seasons 1-7 and be there as Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Xander Harris, Rupert Giles, Willow Rosenberg, Dawn Summers, Spike, Anya, and yes even the nerd Jonathon come full circle in this truly spectacular series we've come to love.P.S. Keep an eye open for a hidden easter egg in the special features on disc 6 of season 7.

In order to fix her mistake, she asks that the spell be undone. Knowing the price of the reversal is the life of a Vengeance Demon, she's willing to make the sacrifice.""Bring On The Night""  Giles arrives with three potential slayers and he reveals that the 'First Evil' is killing off the line of slayers in an attempt to rid the world of good, leaving The Hellmouth free to open. He tells Buffy that there are more potential slayers on their way to Sunnydale. Buffy and Giles search the christmas tree lot where they last discovered the Bringers, Buffy goes underground and is challenged by a very strong vampire who is luckily scared off by the sunrise. Giles confirms that he was a Turok-Han, a vampire which vampires fear.""First Date""  Buffy goes on a dinner date with Principal Wood to try and find out what is really going on with him. After they are attacked and he shows off some fighting skill in dusting a few vamps, he explains that he is the son of a Slayer that was killed in New York by Spike.""Dirty Girls""  Faith's arrival brings a lot of tension to Buffy's house. All the potentials ask questions, but Faith is only interested in talking with Buffy. And the Mysterious ""priest"" Caleb appears.""Empty Places""  Following Caleb's attack, Xander is now blind in one eye. Buffy takes all the guilt and again encounters Caleb at the abandoned school.

849505,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0002XVKMC,Tom Benton,"[11, 14]","As a huge ""Buffy"" fan, I was both nervous and excited when I received the Seventh Season DVDs in the mail: nervous, because it was the final season - what if it wasn't good?  And excited, because it WAS the final season, and traditionally, much happens during the final year of a TV show.  I'd read reviews claiming that the season was terrible, so I began the season expecting to be a little disappointed.But I wasn't.  The first five episodes were terrific.  They made me feel like I was back in the good ol' days of ""Buffy"", in the early seasons.  ""Lessons"", the season opener, was great and filled with Joss Whedon's trademark wit (although he wrote the episode, he didn't direct it).  ""Him"", while not the most brilliant episode, was very enjoyable (particularly a sequence towards the end of the episode, with some terrific music and editing).  ""Conversations with Dead People"" was a great episode, thanks to numerous intriguing storylines and a fine script (not to mention a great performance by Jonathan Woodward as a talkative undead college student).From there, it all went downhill.Out of nowhere, the show's footing disappeared.  The ""Potential Slayers"" were introduced, a group of whiney girls whom do nearly nothing for the storyline.  For something like seven or eight episodes, we're forced to endure the training of the Potentials.  Those eight or so episodes are some of the worst - and by far the hokiest - that the show has produced.  The show's major comeback was the seventeenth episode, ""Lies My Parents Told Me"".  It was a very interesting, cool, well-written episode, in which Principal Wood attempts to murder Spike for a crime he committed long ago.  From there on, the show improved, but it still wasn't like it used to be.The finale - ""Chosen"" - was one of the greatest episodes of the show.  Written and directed by Joss Whedon, it's filled with great Whedon dialog, humor, and action.  Whedon gives the show the dramatic, explosive, and very fitting ending the show so rightly deserved.The two finer characters introduced in the season - Principal Robin Wood, and Caleb, the Evil Preacher - really improved the episodes (although Wood seemed to disappear in some of the later episodes).  As I love Joss Whedon's sci-fi/western show ""Firefly"", I thought it was fantastic to see Nathan Fillion (the star of that show) appear on ""Buffy"" as Caleb.Willow never really shines in this season until the final episode (you can tell Whedon loves her).  Sarah Michelle Gellar does her best to work with the weak material she's given, as do the rest of the cast members.The really horrible thing about this season is that there's a point where you just stop caring.  You watch the episodes because you have to to complete the series.  But the season is worth purchasing, if only for the first seven episodes and the last five episodes.TOP 5 OF THE SEASON1.

849507,A2KUMYWXAQNARZ,B0002XVKMC,toronto,"[0, 1]","SPOILERS TOO!As with other reviewers,  I consider Buffy to be among the best television ever (one need only compare it to Angel  to see how hard it is to really carry this stuff off).  Season 7 is also not the best of them all, except for the fact that the last episode is really the most brilliant coup.  One can forgive almost anything with such an ending, even the not very interesting setup (Caleb is a caricature, and, as others have said, the First is the Last).There is a sense in this Season that the writers were writing character shifts in order to set up great scenes, rather than the other way around -- e.g.(1) It may be that the series ended a bit too soon for the writers.  It is really set up that Robin Wood and Buffy would get together, not the Faith detour.  He is certainly in a different league than, say, Riley (yawn).(2) The Willow/Kennedy scene about betraying Tara was quite moving, but I also didn't believe in the romance.  It was as if the writers needed the romance so they could get to that scene.(3) The bringing back of dead characters was a waste (again, written so that there could be scenes, not characters)There is also something weird about the Potentials, as if they were from some porn sex army/Charlie's Angels episode (as ever, Whedon inserts his own critique, cf. the girls' pillow fight).Nevertheless -- and in spite of the earlier long-winded Buffy speeches, the last speech and the rising up of the women was amazing and powerful.  It was beautifully set up and edited,  and the last fifteen minutes just have this astonishing rhythm, and it is clear that it was where Whedon was going -- even if he didn't exactly have the ending -- all along.

All these obsessive fanboy categorizations might drive an outside observer to compare us to Trekkies (only, you know, better-looking).  Whenever you hear Buffy fans say this or that about a particular season, you should remember that these are family members talking about the rest of their family (like when you were 15 and said you ""hated"" your parents but didn't mean it...I hope).  All seasons of Buffy have their virtues.  The cast and crew have not really changed in its seven year tenure as TV's best show.  If anything, the technical aspects of the show have gotten better.  We just all remember watching Angel lose his soul.  And we cried.  Alot.  We remember Oz and Will make love.  Watching Willow fall in love with Tara or Buffy with Riley or Spike become a Disney-esque wacky sidekick, we couldn't handle it.  We still loved it, but we resorted to meaningless rankings to soothe our ""been there from the beginning"" pain.  Everyone who ""hates"" Season 4 would still watch ""Beer Bad"" over most anything else, just like all the Season 6 haters would still opt to watch ""Doublemeat Palace"" over CSI: New Jersey (or whatever it is).  We love all the seasons, even when we say we hate them.  So, potential (you'll get that later), let me be the first of the extended scooby gang to tell you that Season 7 is great.  Now, you do have to plunk down some cash for the other seasons before you get here, but it's well worth it.  Season 7 had so much going on.  Like Season 6, it was really for the fans (much to UPN's dismay).  All the name-dropping, guest stars, in-jokes, everything.  It was all tailored towards us.  And the drama was just brilliant, really paying off all the events of Season 6.  Eps like ""Selfess,"" ""The Killer In Me"" and ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" are dense and rich.  The action hit its peak this year, and all the fighting is a handy palette cleanser, but you know that's not why you watch.  You watch to see Willow turn into the man who killed the love of her life.  You watch Anya dying, except not really.  You watch for Xander to not appear at all in one episode and then deliver a beautiful speech the next.  This is also the scariest season.  They really made it a point to make things jumpier.  Technically, and I don't know if this is just me, this season looks very different.  The colors are a little less saturated, a bit grainer and the frame seems to be longer.  It fits though.  Season 7 was great, trust me.  Just like all the other seasons.  And, here's a handy litmus test for you.

Coming off the most fan-hated season to date, Joss Whedon went back to the beginning with this series, planning the story-arcs almost a year an advance, and deciding to return to the roots of the series, presenting a mixture of drama and comedy, filler episodes and arc episodes, themes and happyness, etc.  Not long after the season premier on UPN, Sarah Michelle Gellar gave Entertainment Weekly an exclusive interview titled: ""Buffy in its current incarnation, is over"" and within the week her, along with Joss Whedon and the President of UPN made a joint announcement that the series would come to a close the following May.The producers/writers where given approx. 16 episodes and 6 months to wrap up the seven years of storylines, and for the most part they do an amazing job.  Whedon takes the series back to the beginning and finally takes Buffy from the innocent and naive school-girl (where the series started) to a loving mother/menter for others.  Also, he brings in 'the original evil' as this year's badguy - bringing back a bunch of old cahracters in the process.Obviously, after seven-years as well as a spin-off and countless comic books, novels, and other media it was going to be next to impossible to provide an adequate and unique ending to a show that somehow became an icon of its generation (I personally do not know a single human around my age that hasn't seen atleast a couple of episodes...), but somehow Joss Whedon provided his loyal viewers with a fitting ending to the series...

849511,A21GPR0JNQ9NPP,B0002XVKMC,"Warren Liebold ""WLNYC""","[14, 20]","The last two or three seasons of BtVS came in for more than a bit of fan criticism, primarily because some fans refused to grow with the characters and the series. It's not that the show *always* made the best decisions, but for television, they did extraordinarily well and they generally stuck to the primary themes which made the show great. The show continued to create new characters and plot lines that expanded and enhanced the original vision. This season and the 6th were an overt challenge to viewers and in the 7th, the producers had to decide to wrap things up. As the show developed over the years, boogey-man physical villians became the villiany of power, the challenge of simply living, and the existence of evil itself. On each occasion, the writers were true to the show's roots and in this final season, it leads to a finale which left me crying and cheering, and asking one of the questions the show has always been asking in different ways: ""Are you ready to be strong?""",5,Going Out On Top,1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,991,"['last', 'two', 'three', 'seasons', 'BtVS', 'came', 'more', 'bit', 'fan', 'criticism', 'primarily', 'fans', 'refused', 'grow', 'characters', 'series', 'not', 'show', '*always*', 'made', 'best', 'decisions', 'television', 'did', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'generally', 'stuck', 'primary', 'themes', 'made', 'show', 'great', 'show', 'continued', 'create', 'new', 'characters', 'plot', 'lines', 'expanded', 'enhanced', 'original', 'vision', 'season', '6th', 'were', 'overt', 'challenge', 'viewers', '7th', 'producers', 'had', 'decide', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'show', 'developed', 'years', 'boogey-man', 'physical', 'villians', 'became', 'villiany', 'power', 'challenge', 'simply', 'living', 'existence', 'evil', 'occasion', 'writers', 'were', 'true', 'show', 'roots', 'final', 'season', 'finale', 'left', 'crying', 'cheering', 'asking', 'one', 'questions', 'show', 'always', 'been', 'asking', 'different', 'ways', 'Are', 'ready', 'be', 'strong']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season
849512,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0002XVKMC,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[5, 6]","Buffy ends her long run as ""The Chosen One"" with the last season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". The series managed to touch a nerve with teens, college students and, yes, older folks. Joss Whedon admits that he wanted to reclaim the past with the last season; it's a look back more than a look forward at what will happen to the characters now that they've served their time in high school and moved on. Buffy becomes a guidance counselor at her rebuilt high school, Willow returns uncertain of herself, Spike nearly loses his mind after regaining his soul and there's a sense of closure that one might not expect with most TV series.A very nice transfer from Fox is a highlight of the final season. It seems as time has moved on, the series has improved on DVD in terms of the picture and sound quality. Colors are bright and vibrant although some of the episodes still suffer from some digital blemishes. A very nice sound mix here as well with nice presence.A number of really good featurettes including ""Buffy: Full Circle"" where most of the cast (sans Sara Michelle Geller), the producers and writers discuss the changes over the previous seasons and how (in Joss Whedon's words), it was time to revisit the way the series started at the very end but with Buffy in more of a mentor role this time around. ""Generation S"" discusses the characters of the ""potentials"" that could conceivably replace Buffy. The various chararcters that made the cut including the characters of Rona, Kennedy  and Amanda are highlighted and interviewed in this featurette. They discuss the rigors of the physical activity, the changes to the characters during their brief run on the last season. ""The Last Sundown"" has creator/producer/writer Joss Whedon looking back at his favorite ten episodes throughout the seven season run of the series. It's primarily a ""clip"" featurette with brief comments from Whedon. ""Buffy 101: Studying the Slayer"" features Matt Roush TV Guide critic, Robert Bianco TV critic for USA Today, the Associate Dean of UCLA's Theater Arts Department gushing about how the series broke new ground and tackled a number of interesting themes. Amazon lists a featurette on the fans but I sure didn't see it unless it isn't on the specail features disc (or if its an Easter Egg)We also get the outtakes reel.Seven commentary tracks for seven of the best episodes from the seventh season allows fans to generously glance at the creativity at the center of the series. The best of the lot is Joss Whedon's for ""Chosen"" and ""Help"" (along with commentary by director David Solomon) but there's also two very good commentaries featuring the director, writer and key actors from ""Lies my parents Told Me"".  Fox has put together a very generous package with plenty of background on the creation of various episodes that will help keep the series fresh for the second or third viewing.While the seven season of ""Buffy"" wasn't its best, part of that was due to the amount of change introduced during the last season. The last season was still very strong for the show. That's a pretty darning thing to do for any season during its run much less the last. ""Buffy"" continued to be idiosyncratic, unique, funny and groundbreaking to the very end. That's not something that can be said for every TV series.",5,A sneak peak at Buffy's seventh season special features,1100390400,"11 14, 2004",2004,3295,"['Buffy', 'long', 'run', 'Chosen', 'One', 'last', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'series', 'managed', 'touch', 'nerve', 'teens', 'college', 'students', 'yes', 'older', 'folks', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'wanted', 'reclaim', 'past', 'last', 'season', 'look', 'back', 'more', 'look', 'forward', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'characters', 'now', ""'ve"", 'served', 'time', 'high', 'school', 'moved', 'Buffy', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'rebuilt', 'high', 'school', 'Willow', 'uncertain', 'herself', 'Spike', 'nearly', 'mind', 'regaining', 'soul', 'sense', 'closure', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'expect', 'most', 'TV', 'series.A', 'very', 'nice', 'transfer', 'Fox', 'highlight', 'final', 'season', 'time', 'moved', 'series', 'improved', 'DVD', 'terms', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'Colors', 'are', 'bright', 'vibrant', 'episodes', 'still', 'suffer', 'digital', 'blemishes', 'very', 'nice', 'sound', 'mix', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'presence.A', 'number', 'really', 'good', 'featurettes', 'including', 'Buffy', 'Full', 'Circle', 'where', 'most', 'cast', 'sans', 'Sara', 'Michelle', 'Geller', 'producers', 'writers', 'discuss', 'changes', 'previous', 'seasons', 'how', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'words', 'was', 'time', 'revisit', 'way', 'series', 'started', 'very', 'end', 'Buffy', 'more', 'mentor', 'role', 'time', 'around', 'Generation', 'S', 'characters', 'potentials', 'could', 'conceivably', 'replace', 'Buffy', 'various', 'chararcters', 'made', 'cut', 'including', 'characters', 'Rona', 'Kennedy', 'Amanda', 'are', 'highlighted', 'interviewed', 'featurette', 'discuss', 'rigors', 'physical', 'activity', 'changes', 'characters', 'brief', 'run', 'last', 'season', 'Last', 'Sundown', 'creator/producer/writer', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'looking', 'back', 'favorite', 'ten', 'seven', 'season', 'run', 'series', 'primarily', 'clip', 'featurette', 'brief', 'comments', 'Whedon', 'Buffy', '101', 'Studying', 'Slayer', 'Matt', 'Roush', 'TV', 'Guide', 'critic', 'Robert', 'Bianco', 'TV', 'critic', 'USA', 'Today', 'Associate', 'Dean', 'UCLA', 'Theater', 'Arts', 'Department', 'gushing', 'how', 'series', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'tackled', 'number', 'interesting', 'themes', 'Amazon', 'featurette', 'fans', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', ""n't"", 'specail', 'features', 'disc', 'Easter', 'Egg', 'also', 'get', 'outtakes', 'reel.Seven', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'seven', 'best', 'episodes', 'seventh', 'season', 'allows', 'fans', 'generously', 'glance', 'creativity', 'center', 'series', 'best', 'lot', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Chosen', 'Help', 'commentary', 'director', 'David', 'Solomon', 'also', 'two', 'very', 'good', 'commentaries', 'featuring', 'director', 'writer', 'key', 'actors', 'Lies', 'parents', 'Told', 'Me', 'Fox', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'generous', 'package', 'plenty', 'background', 'creation', 'various', 'episodes', 'will', 'help', 'keep', 'series', 'fresh', 'second', 'third', 'seven', 'season', 'Buffy', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'part', 'was', 'due', 'amount', 'change', 'introduced', 'last', 'season', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'strong', 'show', 'pretty', 'darning', 'thing', 'do', 'season', 'run', 'much', 'less', 'last', 'Buffy', 'continued', 'be', 'idiosyncratic', 'unique', 'funny', 'groundbreaking', 'very', 'end', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'TV', 'series']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season
849513,A3I92PEEL1B62O,B0002XVKMC,"wysewomon ""wysewomon""","[7, 12]","Prior to the seventh and last season of BtVS, the writers made a point of telling us, repeatedly, that they were ""going back to the beginning.""  There was a great deal of fan speculation, at the time, as to what that meant.  Unfortunately, once the season was over, we still didn't know what it meant.  It's a good thing some of the DVD features finally explain it.In my opinion, season seven was the weakest season of Buffy.  There were some stellar moments--""Selfless,"" the Hugo award-winning ""Conversations With Dead People,"" and ""Storyteller"" stand out among the series' best episdoes--but overall the season did not hang together the way the rest did.  It was far too cluttered with supernumerary characters and half-baked subplots. The First as a villain was too amorphous to be scary;  the introduction of Caleb in the last five episiodes (with his strident misogyny) was just annoying;  Buffy's speech-making was more yawnsome than rousing.  And the Potentials really irritated me.That being said, this season views better the 2nd and 3rd time around, and improves from the ability to see the episodes back to back over the course of a week or so, rather than spread out over a season.  The overall arc is easier to follow and the themes make more sense.  The presence of the Potentials is less irksome and even Kennedy doesn't irritate the way she initially did.  I still didn't like the arc and it didn't say to me what the writers thought they were saying.  So I would have to conclude it didn't work as well as other seasons.  However, for what it is, it's done well.  And Buffy is still exceptional TV in any form.AS for the DVD set itself, I found it also less satisfying than any of the others.  The featurettes are really, really uninteresting, short and pretty much lifeless. All of them show the same footage form season seven over and over again, with not much different interview segments behind them.  The outtakes reel was pointless.  And, except for the one on ""Chosen,"" the commentaries were super-dull.  Except for Drew Goddard, who provides commentary for virtually every episode that has it, and who was still new enough to BUffy to avoid the exhaustion everyone else seems to be suffering, no one has a thing to say.  I wish, also, that the DVD could have included some of the deleted scenes that kept getting mentioned.  That would have been interesting.If you're a fan of BtVS, you need to own this, of course. But it's not as good as some of the others.",3,"My Least Favourite Season, But Still Great TV",1102723200,"12 11, 2004",2004,2484,"['Prior', 'seventh', 'last', 'season', 'BtVS', 'writers', 'made', 'point', 'telling', 'repeatedly', 'were', 'going', 'back', 'beginning', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'fan', 'speculation', 'time', 'what', 'meant', 'Unfortunately', 'once', 'season', 'was', 'over', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'meant', 'good', 'thing', 'DVD', 'finally', 'explain', 'it.In', 'opinion', 'season', 'seven', 'was', 'weakest', 'season', 'Buffy', 'were', 'stellar', 'moments', 'Selfless', 'Hugo', 'award-winning', 'Conversations', 'Dead', 'People', 'Storyteller', 'stand', 'out', 'series', 'best', 'episdoes', 'season', 'did', 'not', 'hang', 'together', 'way', 'rest', 'did', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'cluttered', 'supernumerary', 'characters', 'half-baked', 'subplots', 'First', 'villain', 'was', 'too', 'amorphous', 'be', 'scary', 'introduction', 'Caleb', 'last', 'five', 'episiodes', 'strident', 'misogyny', 'was', 'just', 'annoying', 'Buffy', 'speech-making', 'was', 'more', 'yawnsome', 'rousing', 'Potentials', 'really', 'irritated', 'me.That', 'being', 'said', 'season', 'better', '2nd', '3rd', 'time', 'ability', 'see', 'episodes', 'back', 'back', 'course', 'week', 'so', 'rather', 'spread', 'out', 'season', 'overall', 'arc', 'easier', 'follow', 'themes', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'presence', 'Potentials', 'less', 'irksome', 'even', 'Kennedy', ""n't"", 'irritate', 'way', 'initially', 'did', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'arc', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'writers', 'thought', 'were', 'saying', 'would', 'have', 'conclude', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'seasons', 'However', 'what', 'done', 'well', 'Buffy', 'still', 'exceptional', 'TV', 'form.AS', 'DVD', 'set', 'found', 'also', 'less', 'satisfying', 'others', 'featurettes', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'uninteresting', 'short', 'pretty', 'much', 'lifeless', 'show', 'same', 'footage', 'form', 'season', 'seven', 'over', 'again', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'interview', 'segments', 'outtakes', 'reel', 'was', 'pointless', 'one', 'Chosen', 'commentaries', 'were', 'super-dull', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'who', 'commentary', 'virtually', 'episode', 'who', 'was', 'still', 'new', 'enough', 'BUffy', 'avoid', 'exhaustion', 'everyone', 'else', 'be', 'suffering', 'one', 'thing', 'say', 'wish', 'also', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'kept', 'getting', 'mentioned', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'BtVS', 'need', 'own', 'course', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'others']",Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Seventh Season

849515,A18RJ91B28WFJ2,B0002XVKMC,zebrastripes,"[0, 0]","Does Buffy the Vampire Slayer get too much criticism for their seventh season? It does seem like the show got a lot of slack for season four and six, two seasons that I really enjoyed despite their drawbacks. Sadly, season seven does deserve some of the negativity it draws. It is not a horrible season, I actually liked a lot of it and feel like deserves the four stars, but it is easily my least favorite season of the show.I feel like it had a lot of missed potential. It's main villain, The First, is basically satan. He can transform to look like anyone and taunt them. It is effectively frightening in the episode called Conversations with Dead People. But for the rest of the show? It falls completely flat and is definitely not convincing or scary. Also, this season consisted of the addition of many new characters that just feel rushed and unlikeable. I feel like in this season, there was little time to wrap the show up. Maybe the writers panicked.On the bright side, it is still Buffy. Andrew was a wonderful and funny addition to the cast and I absolutely loved how the relationship between Spike and Buffy was ended. Spike was the hero all along, beautiful. While I did enjoy the season final, it would have been nice to see it as a hour long special. Shame it was the normal 40 minutes.
