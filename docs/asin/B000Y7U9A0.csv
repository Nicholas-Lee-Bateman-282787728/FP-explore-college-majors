1116171,AABUMYAMYWUSS,B000Y7U9A0,Anso,"[4, 4]","This is a good doc about Jewish Americans and how they emigrated to the United States.  It was quite interesting to discover that the nursing profession was invented by a Jewish woman in New York.  There are very fascinating facts throught this piece.  There are many contributons discussed including commentary from Michael Tilson Thomas on his grandfather's contribution to early Yiddish theatre as well as Irving Berlin's impact on the music world.  However, good this may be I am baffled at the omission of a great American Jewish composer who is not mentioned in this film  or the comapnion book: George Gerswhin.  His contribution is unparraled and there is not one word about him.  By no means is this a comprehensive history.  And there is a key point that Younger Jews today who have money and did not grow up in poverty or victims of Anti-Semitism will probably be out of touch with the early Jewsih experience and not realte to this at all.  As is the case with many younger generations who don't seem to appreciate the roads that are paved a little further for them so that they may struggle less than those before them.

Caveat:  I am Jewish and I grew up post-WWII with parents who were children prior to WWII.

It also has beautiful music, and graphics are used extremely well.  But, CAUTION:  I have no idea how well this collection will be received by people for whom the information is NOT so personal.

Once I started watching it from the very beginning, when the Sepphardic Jews came to America, I was instantly hooked.  I especially enjoyed the commentary by various people that recalled what Jewish life was like during the 1940s, especially during WW2.  The insight provided by rabbis was informative as well.  Another segment that stands out is the 1950s when Jewish Americans vacationed in the Catskills of upstate New York.  Any big name Jewish comedian that you've seen in various TV sitcoms, variety shows and movies got their start at the many nightclubs of the Catskills.  Sid Cesar himself even said that performing there was like his 'going to college'.  If audiences in those clubs laughed, they knew they were doing their job right.
