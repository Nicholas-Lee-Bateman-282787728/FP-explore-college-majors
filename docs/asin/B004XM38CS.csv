1432475,A3PFKE8EFXAXQE,B004XM38CS,"cornbreadthedog ""larue""","[0, 0]","The first rule of any good super-hero t.v. show: the audience wants to see the super-hero, as much as possible and for as long as possible, come on in and save the day and do great heroic things (set to a rousing and heroic musical score).It's so funny how most t.v. show producers/writers completely keep forgetting  about that one very simple golden rule. Especially right here on THE CAPE television series.The first episode(the pilot episode) of THE CAPE was truly fantastic and gets 4 humungous big stars! Plus, I really loved KEITH DAVID'S(DISNEY'S:THE PRINCESS & THE FROG) haunting portrayal of MAX MELINI, the leader of the Carnival of Crime! Another great reason for the 4 star ratings.Sadly,though, the rest of the remaining 9 episodes of THE CAPE were nowhere near as fun as the first episode. On an average 39 minute episode, VINCE FARADAY (DAVID LYONS) was only in his dark super-hero outfit doing heroic deeds for like about 6 minutes or so. The other minutes of this show are just grossly invested on all this set-up and character building. Many's a time, while watching THE CAPE, I kept wanting for there to be less talking and way more super-hero action and fighting.I mean, THE CAPE character declared all-out war on the insanely corrupt police force in Palm City! Half of this show should've been about THE CAPE busting corrupt ARK Corps. cops on the take, rescuing kids from burning buildings, fighting real super villains with real powers,storming drug houses, gliding over rooftops and dodging ARK helicopter gunfire, and slamming gang members against brick walls and then disappearing back into the shadows.Like the NBC t.v. series before it, HEROES, THE CAPE just wasted too much time on set-up and character building and bored and exhausted it's audience away. Us comic book/super-hero fans are tuning in for cool action and hot super-powers. Not 40 minute talk-fests. Remember this: A way-too chatty girl-friend is an ex girl-friend waiting to happen.Plus, I could already tell from just from these 10 episodes alone on this disc that the writers/producers of this show was just going to drag and drag this ""THE CAPE vs. the villain, CHESS, and the crooked cops of Palm City"" thing on out for like another 2-3 seasons. THE CAPE should've taken down CHESS in just one season and then kept moving on to even bigger and badder villains per episode and per season. Now that's how you do a great super-hero t.v. show, baby!Still, I do say to please check this series out just for KEITH DAVID'S spectacular performance and a few other cool super hero moments that'll bring a smile to a COMIC-CON fan-boy's lips!",4,"I LIKED 'THE CAPE"" TV SHOW BUT I TOTALLY CAN GET WHY IT WAS CANCELLED!",1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,2631,"['first', 'rule', 'good', 'super-hero', 't.v', 'show', 'audience', 'see', 'super-hero', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'come', 'save', 'day', 'do', 'great', 'heroic', 'things', 'set', 'rousing', 'heroic', 'musical', 'score', '.It', 'so', 'funny', 'how', 'most', 't.v', 'show', 'producers/writers', 'completely', 'keep', 'forgetting', 'one', 'very', 'simple', 'golden', 'rule', 'Especially', 'right', 'here', 'THE', 'CAPE', 'television', 'series.The', 'first', 'episode', 'pilot', 'episode', 'THE', 'CAPE', 'was', 'truly', 'fantastic', '4', 'humungous', 'big', 'stars', 'really', 'loved', 'KEITH', 'DAVID', 'DISNEY', 'THE', 'PRINCESS', 'THE', 'FROG', 'haunting', 'portrayal', 'MAX', 'MELINI', 'leader', 'Carnival', 'Crime', 'great', 'reason', '4', 'star', 'ratings.Sadly', 'rest', 'remaining', '9', 'episodes', 'THE', 'CAPE', 'were', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'fun', 'first', 'episode', 'average', '39', 'minute', 'episode', 'VINCE', 'FARADAY', 'DAVID', 'LYONS', 'was', 'only', 'dark', 'super-hero', 'outfit', 'doing', 'heroic', 'deeds', '6', 'minutes', 'so', 'other', 'minutes', 'show', 'are', 'just', 'grossly', 'invested', 'set-up', 'character', 'building', 'Many', 'time', 'watching', 'THE', 'CAPE', 'kept', 'wanting', 'be', 'less', 'talking', 'way', 'more', 'super-hero', 'action', 'fighting.I', 'mean', 'THE', 'CAPE', 'character', 'declared', 'all-out', 'war', 'insanely', 'corrupt', 'police', 'force', 'Palm', 'City', 'Half', 'show', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'THE', 'CAPE', 'busting', 'corrupt', 'ARK', 'Corps', 'cops', 'take', 'rescuing', 'kids', 'burning', 'buildings', 'fighting', 'real', 'super', 'villains', 'real', 'powers', 'storming', 'drug', 'houses', 'gliding', 'rooftops', 'dodging', 'ARK', 'helicopter', 'gunfire', 'slamming', 'gang', 'members', 'brick', 'walls', 'then', 'disappearing', 'back', 'shadows.Like', 'NBC', 't.v', 'series', 'HEROES', 'THE', 'CAPE', 'just', 'wasted', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'set-up', 'character', 'building', 'bored', 'exhausted', 'audience', 'away', 'Us', 'comic', 'book/super-hero', 'fans', 'are', 'tuning', 'cool', 'action', 'hot', 'super-powers', 'Not', '40', 'minute', 'talk-fests', 'Remember', 'way-too', 'chatty', 'girl-friend', 'ex', 'girl-friend', 'waiting', 'happen.Plus', 'could', 'already', 'tell', 'just', '10', 'episodes', 'alone', 'disc', 'writers/producers', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'drag', 'drag', 'THE', 'CAPE', 'villain', 'CHESS', 'crooked', 'cops', 'Palm', 'City', 'thing', 'out', '2-3', 'seasons', 'CAPE', 'should', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'down', 'CHESS', 'just', 'one', 'season', 'then', 'kept', 'moving', 'even', 'bigger', 'badder', 'villains', 'episode', 'season', 'Now', 'how', 'do', 'great', 'super-hero', 't.v', 'show', 'baby', 'Still', 'do', 'say', 'please', 'check', 'series', 'out', 'just', 'KEITH', 'DAVID', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'few', 'other', 'cool', 'super', 'hero', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'smile', 'COMIC-CON', 'fan-boy', 'lips']",N/A

For what is--a guy with a cape fights crime--the show is far too ambitious for its own good. At any given time, we go from slapstick comedy high jinks with the circus characters, immediately into the Cape's wife and son in tears while mourning his loss, and from that immediately into the Cape duking it out with a room full of henchmen. The creators are trying to do Christopher Nolan one second, Tim Burton the next, and Martin Scorcese after that. This mishmash of styles and tones is jarring and viewers will be exhausted by the time each episode ends; not in a good way. So, yeah, the series of something of a mess, but it does have its good points. The action scenes are generally well-staged, the production values are solid, the villains-of-the-week are interesting, and it is pretty sweet to see our hero whip that cape around when fighting bad guys.

He was sort of a poor man's Batman, with a not very interesting lead-villain.  I watched a few episodes until I couldn't bare anymore.

Williams ""gareth37""","[24, 30]","The Cape had all the right elements: an honest cop, a beautiful wife, an adoring son, a super villain, an alluring, intelligent young woman, a best friend with a secret, and a group of circus criminals who were really not a bad lot when you got to know them. So, what went wrong?NBC gave The Cape a good time slot.  NBC promoted it heavily.As the storyline developed, the main characters were filled out with their back ground stories.  Episodes were improving in plot and character development.Peter Fleming's Chess alter ego was given a sympatric storyline.  Max Malini and Rollo were just two great characters, brave, courageous and of course thieves.Keith David is a fine actor, and he played Max Malini to the hilt with a devilish glee.  Martin Klebba's Rollo was a delight as he interacted with Max and The Cape.  His fight with the evil Scales was one of those rare moments.Summer Glau's mysterious Orwell character was just stunning. The evolution of her character was well done as her feelings for The Cape intensified as each episode progressed.  Her true identity was revealed in bits and pieces.Trip Faraday represented every boy and his love for comic book heroes.  His belief in his dad was very touching.  The Cape, his own personal superhero, gave him a sense of hope and wonder.Dana Faraday's steadfast belief in her husband's innocence was a constant in the series.  She truly loved her husband and took every opportunity to prove his innocence.I watched every episode and enjoyed it.  Of course, it was not perfect.In this day and age of economic ups and downs, a television program needs to click with viewers real fast in order to survive.  It is unfortunate that series are not given a full season (22 episodes) to develop viewership.Of course, The Cape's ratings fell from 8.6 million to 4.06 million over the course of its short airing.  It was a dismal failure in terms of revenue generation for NBC as were some other new series-The Event, Chase, and Undercovers.Should you buy this series?

Don't get me right its still an enjoyable ride, but it could have been so much better.To begin with I was left unmoved by the hero's decision to put on the cape, it seemed like a silly device for a cop with a gun to use, and though it comes with some cool tricks, it can stretch out and hook things, grab things, and help him be sort of bullet proof, quite frankly a gun like punisher would have been so much more logical. Having said that our hero is a likeable enough sort and for the most part part he carries the show.On the sadder side were the other members of the production. His family were nice enough, but the gooey sentimentality that kept interrupting the show, slowed things down immensely and just made it harder to watch. The circus (carnivale of crime) though were more difficult to follow. No matter how I tried I couldn't get my head around who they were or why they did what they did. At one point right at the start they rescue our hero and want him to help them. Then because he's not the truly evil murdering bad guy they thought he was, they want to run him out to the desert and cut his head and hands off. Then when he gives them a key card, the boss takes him in, gives him the cape and starts training him in the art of illusion. Their motivations were all over the place. Possibly this was intentional and would have been explained had the series continued. But as it was they just confused me.The action though was good, the special effects with the dissappearing gas bombs good, and had our hero been just a touch more tough (had he been Batman for example) it could have been really swinging.I wanted to give it three and a half stars, a sort of good but could do better, but Amazon only allows three or four so I boosted it to four.",4,Watchable but flawed,1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,1865,"['Hi', 'normally', 'enjoy', 'superhero', 'movies', 'series', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'standard', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better.To', 'begin', 'was', 'left', 'unmoved', 'hero', 'decision', 'put', 'cape', 'seemed', 'silly', 'device', 'cop', 'gun', 'use', 'cool', 'tricks', 'can', 'stretch', 'out', 'hook', 'things', 'grab', 'things', 'help', 'be', 'sort', 'bullet', 'proof', 'quite', 'frankly', 'gun', 'punisher', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'logical', 'Having', 'said', 'hero', 'likeable', 'enough', 'sort', 'most', 'part', 'part', 'show.On', 'sadder', 'side', 'were', 'other', 'members', 'production', 'family', 'were', 'nice', 'enough', 'gooey', 'sentimentality', 'kept', 'interrupting', 'show', 'slowed', 'things', 'down', 'immensely', 'just', 'made', 'harder', 'watch', 'circus', 'carnivale', 'crime', 'were', 'more', 'difficult', 'follow', 'matter', 'how', 'tried', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'who', 'were', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'one', 'point', 'right', 'start', 'rescue', 'hero', 'want', 'help', 'Then', 'not', 'truly', 'evil', 'murdering', 'bad', 'guy', 'thought', 'was', 'want', 'run', 'out', 'desert', 'cut', 'head', 'off', 'Then', 'when', 'key', 'card', 'boss', 'cape', 'training', 'art', 'illusion', 'motivations', 'were', 'place', 'Possibly', 'was', 'intentional', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'explained', 'had', 'series', 'continued', 'was', 'just', 'confused', 'me.The', 'action', 'was', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'dissappearing', 'gas', 'bombs', 'good', 'had', 'hero', 'been', 'just', 'touch', 'more', 'tough', 'had', 'been', 'Batman', 'example', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'swinging.I', 'wanted', 'give', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'sort', 'good', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'Amazon', 'only', 'three', 'four', 'boosted', 'four']",N/A
1432484,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004XM38CS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[74, 82]","TV shows always seem to be an all or nothing proposition in Amazon reviews.  If someone watches a show, they automatically feel that it is five star quality despite its limitations.  If someone tries a show and doesn't like it, they generally relegate it to a one star status despite its good points.  Don't believe it?  Go to the reviews of any program you absolutely hate and look at the glowing five star reviews from its fans.  In truth, most shows fall somewhere in between--not every show you watch should automatically be considered as great entertainment and not every show you dislike merits a dismissive one star.  I bring this up with NBC's short lived ""The Cape"" for one reason--I have only heard the show described as terrific or as terrible with very little middle ground.  Personally, I think the show is neither terrific nor terrible but falls into the TV netherworld of a show with potential that never really fulfilled its promise.Capitalizing on the notion that every story with comic book origins deserves a Hollywood treatment (in itself, a specious idea), ""The Cape"" was introduced to capture the audience left when the increasingly problematic ""Heroes"" left the air.  But lacking that show's complex mythology and appealing cast, it was an uphill battle from the start.  I do contend that the elements to have developed a successful show were all present, they were just never assembled in the right way.The Good:  David Lyons was a likable lead--a family man and cop who is forced into a heroic alter ego when framed (and seemingly murdered) by the town's super villain.  James Frain has a nice menace as the unstable foe.  Morally corrupt Keith David and a bevy of carnival performers provide unlikely support to our new hero.  And sci-fi stalwart Summer Glau is on hand as the altruistic, and completely underdeveloped, Orwell.  And best of all--Vinnie Jones!The Bad:  The show never loses interest in Lyons' wife and child.  And, I'm sorry, they just aren't compelling characters.  The show's momentum grinds to an absolute halt every time they appear.  Excruciating.The Frustrating:  I don't think the show ever determined what it wanted to do and is tonally all over the place.  Veering from maudlin to comedic from one moment to the next does little to shore up the inconsistencies in the show.  Frain, Glau, and David all have great potential--but none are given fully developed plot lines.  There is simultaneously too much going on and not enough--there needed to be more focus on the elements that worked.  There needed to be more emphasis on the bigger good versus evil concept as opposed to lesser stand alone episodes.The DVD set collects the series' ten episodes (one was only shown on the NBC website, but never aired).  With so many choices in this overcrowded genre, I don't know that ""The Cape"" rates particularly highly.  But it is far from unwatchable and its cast is game.  A show I wanted to like more than I did, it still boasts nice production values and a laugh or two--but never gelled to one cohesive vision.

1432491,A3TD7HLTDWZ382,B004XM38CS,"Pikminfan ""bobsworld3""","[1, 2]","I was really saddened to hear that NBC's ""The Cape"" had been cancelled.  Though it never fully hit its stride, ""The Cape"" sure had an awful lot going for it.  First off-it was a great looking show with fairly decent production values and a nice colorful comic book style.  It also featured a very charismatic and likable protagonist in the lead character ""Vince Faraday"".  A man of  honor, ethics and a dedication to his family-Faraday is the kind of guy I think most of us would aspire to be like.  The characters that made up the carnival were likewise appealing and had the potential to introduce conflict to the show considering their not always so honorable ways.  ""Orwell"" was not only an interesting character, but an interesting concept as well that and added an extra dynamic (and perhaps a bit of subdued romantic tension?) to the show.  Had the series continued-I think it would have drastically improved over the course of a few seasons.  I think this season was all about discovering the direction in which they wanted to take the show-but not knowing fully where they were headed.  Most great television didn't nail it right out of the gate.  Even X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer stumbled a bit their first seasons.The only thing that really soured me on ""The Cape"" were the villains.  With Villains dubbed such generic, ""goofy"" names like ""Chess"" and ""Scales"" how can an otherwise competent show not descend into the world of cheese?  Chess is one of the worst villains I have ever seen on any tv show.  A stupid looking mask and freaky contact lenses-an interesting villain do not make.  And as a note to the creators of the show-if you can't pull off good make up on a limited television budget, then for goodness sakes, don't give one of your villains snake-like skin. Vinnie Jones is a good actor with an intimidating presence-does he really need scaly skin to make him seem formidable?  I would have loved to have seen The Cape go a more ""serious"" route with their villains sort of like Sylar on the first season of Heroes.  For that season (and that season only) Sylar was a mysterious and quite terrifying villain and made a great antagonist to  the heroes.  He didn't need a goofy cliche moniker either.Overall-I really enjoyed ""The Cape"" and I wish it would've stuck around a little longer to fully realize its potential.  The good outweighs the bad for the most part, and I'll always remember this show for Vince, Orwell and the Carney folks-I'll try to forget about the cheese ball villains.",4,The villains ruined it,1312934400,"08 10, 2011",2011,2522,"['was', 'really', 'saddened', 'hear', 'NBC', 'Cape', 'had', 'been', 'cancelled', 'never', 'fully', 'hit', 'stride', 'Cape', 'sure', 'had', 'awful', 'lot', 'going', 'First', 'off-it', 'was', 'great', 'looking', 'show', 'fairly', 'decent', 'production', 'values', 'nice', 'colorful', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'also', 'featured', 'very', 'charismatic', 'likable', 'protagonist', 'lead', 'character', 'Vince', 'Faraday', 'man', 'honor', 'ethics', 'dedication', 'family-Faraday', 'kind', 'guy', 'think', 'most', 'would', 'aspire', 'be', 'characters', 'made', 'up', 'carnival', 'were', 'likewise', 'appealing', 'had', 'potential', 'introduce', 'conflict', 'show', 'considering', 'not', 'always', 'so', 'honorable', 'ways', 'Orwell', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'interesting', 'character', 'interesting', 'concept', 'as', 'well', 'added', 'extra', 'dynamic', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'subdued', 'romantic', 'tension', 'show', 'Had', 'series', 'continued-I', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'drastically', 'improved', 'course', 'few', 'seasons', 'think', 'season', 'was', 'discovering', 'direction', 'wanted', 'take', 'show-but', 'not', 'knowing', 'fully', 'where', 'were', 'headed', 'Most', 'great', 'television', 'did', ""n't"", 'nail', 'right', 'gate', 'Even', 'X-Files', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'stumbled', 'bit', 'first', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'soured', 'Cape', 'were', 'villains', 'Villains', 'dubbed', 'such', 'generic', 'goofy', 'names', 'Chess', 'Scales', 'how', 'can', 'otherwise', 'competent', 'show', 'not', 'descend', 'world', 'cheese', 'Chess', 'one', 'worst', 'villains', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'tv', 'show', 'stupid', 'looking', 'mask', 'freaky', 'contact', 'lenses-an', 'interesting', 'villain', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'note', 'creators', 'show-if', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'good', 'make', 'up', 'limited', 'television', 'budget', 'then', 'goodness', 'sakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'one', 'villains', 'snake-like', 'skin', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'good', 'actor', 'intimidating', 'presence-does', 'really', 'need', 'scaly', 'skin', 'make', 'seem', 'formidable', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'Cape', 'go', 'more', 'serious', 'route', 'villains', 'sort', 'Sylar', 'first', 'season', 'Heroes', 'season', 'season', 'only', 'Sylar', 'was', 'mysterious', 'quite', 'terrifying', 'villain', 'made', 'great', 'antagonist', 'heroes', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'goofy', 'cliche', 'moniker', 'either.Overall-I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Cape', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'stuck', 'little', 'longer', 'fully', 'realize', 'potential', 'good', 'bad', 'most', 'part', ""'ll"", 'always', 'remember', 'show', 'Vince', 'Orwell', 'Carney', 'folks-I', ""'ll"", 'try', 'forget', 'cheese', 'ball', 'villains']",N/A
