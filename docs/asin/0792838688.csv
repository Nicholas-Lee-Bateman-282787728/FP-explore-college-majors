Otherwise, it's a nice drama (not a ""comedy"" as it's often labeled) featuring two men (brothers-in-law), one older one looking after his younger, mentally-slow relative.Brian Wimmer plays ""Willie,"" the caring older in-law and Peter Berg is the younger ""Frank."" There is some action in the beginning, the film then turns a bit sci-fi as the brothers are accidentally frozen in time, and then the last third is a romance. Along the way, there is comedy from time to time.In other words, you get a little bit of everything in here, but in the end it is a drama that entertains throughout the hour-and-a-half.

141429,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,0792838688,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","LATE FOR DINNER (Dir. W. D. Richter, 1991, 92 minutes) makes me ask, Who says the nineties were a total bust for cinema?!Frank (Peter Berg) and his brother-in-law Willie (eternally handsome and eternal bit-player Brian Wimmer) are two simple, silly fellows from New Mexico. It is 1962 and after a few animadventures, including the accidental near-mortal wounding of a gardener, Frank and Willie are tended to by a doctor in Pomona, California (a weirdly powerful performance by Bo Brundin).This doctor had to have known Walt Disney because he happens to be the cryogenics genius of his day. In the few minutes that he treats Willie's gunshot wound (just don't ask me how Willie got shot) and examines Frank, he decides these men are excellent candidates for being the very first cryogenically preserved people. So, he freezes them.It has cheap production values (why does everyone here sound Canadian except for the German cryogenics doctor?). It has moments of bad acting (AHEM, lovely but empty Brian Wimmer). It has a ridiculous plotline that moves like a weird version of an Afterschool Special. It has two implausibly dumb characters in the lead. Yet it WORKS!! The boys wake up 29 years later, in 1991, and go looking for Willie's wife - that's Frank's sister - Joy (a very competent Marcia Gay Harden).This film of course will remind you of the equally sillyForever Young(1992) with Elijah Wood and Mel Gibson, which was a remake (or, rather, RIP-OFF) of DINNER. Filmed on location in New Mexico, which may be the only place on earth that could be mistaken for Toronto.After all, this film only had to contend with classics likeJFK(see my review), China'sRaise the Red Lantern, andThe Silence of the Lambs. This has a spot in there among those other titles, doesn't it?For me, it does. 1991 is as close to the eighties as I can get without backing into the Oscar-worthyThe Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension, and I love it for its cheap, mindless attempt to get young people back into theaters.
