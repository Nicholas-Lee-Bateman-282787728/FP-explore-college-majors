Generally speaking, there are good story lines and well chosen characters. One episode in particular, FLY, LITTLE GIRL, is a very heartwarming story.

I've also written extensively about this series on the &#34;Mannix is Coming!&#34; thread of the Home Theatre Forum.This series is special.It carries all sorts of labels, like &#34;one of the most violent,&#34; that are simply absurd, especially by today's standards of the way violence is used in story as pure shock value -- not as something that fuels the hero's response  We lose something important when we forget that violence in story goes back to fairy tales, and seems to be an essential part of working out some of the more fundamental stuff of life, like the importance of storied heroism in becoming a good individual.  Cultures with violence in story tend to not be violent -- everything depends upon the way the violence fuels the story, the way the hero responds to it.This series does it right and like no other.  It hits a sweet spot that has not been hit since it left the air.Joe Mannix is a classic hero.  The more I study this, the more I believe he is one of the best constructed hero motifs to appear in story.  He adds an element of vulnerability to his larger than life exploits.  He gets hurt a lot.  He isn't perfect.  He keeps going.  He fights the good fight.  His heart is always in the right place.  He is often described as the toughest PI on television.  That is true.  But, he also adds emotion to the mix.If that sounds good on paper, it is even better on screen.This is a series where the actor embodied the character as an alter ego (something observed at the time in numerous articles) and production qualities were at their very best -- from a production company that was known for not cutting corners during the golden age of television.I know of no other series where the main character was such an important part of each episode that there was hardly any supporting cast, the episodes included a mix of physical action, location shots, emotional response and close-ups, and the series lasted for so long -- eight full seasons.  And the series was back in the top 20 when it was canceled in its final season -- still going strong.There will never be another Mannix.  But, we would be better off if there was.  Even better, just buy the DVDs.Even just a few more people out there inspired by the likes of Joe Mannix just might do us some good.",5,simply the best,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,2348,"[""'ve"", 'written', 'reviews', 'seasons', '4', '5', '6', '7', 'series', ""'ve"", 'also', 'written', 'extensively', 'series', '34', 'Mannix', 'Coming', '34', 'thread', 'Home', 'Theatre', 'Forum.This', 'series', 'special.It', 'sorts', 'labels', '34', 'one', 'most', 'violent', '34', 'are', 'simply', 'absurd', 'especially', 'today', 'standards', 'way', 'violence', 'used', 'story', 'pure', 'shock', 'value', 'not', 'something', 'hero', 'response', 'lose', 'something', 'important', 'when', 'forget', 'violence', 'story', 'back', 'fairy', 'tales', 'be', 'essential', 'part', 'working', 'out', 'more', 'fundamental', 'stuff', 'life', 'importance', 'storied', 'heroism', 'becoming', 'good', 'individual', 'Cultures', 'violence', 'story', 'tend', 'not', 'be', 'violent', 'everything', 'way', 'violence', 'fuels', 'story', 'way', 'hero', 'it.This', 'series', 'right', 'other', 'sweet', 'spot', 'not', 'been', 'hit', 'left', 'air.Joe', 'Mannix', 'classic', 'hero', 'more', 'study', 'more', 'believe', 'one', 'best', 'constructed', 'hero', 'motifs', 'appear', 'story', 'element', 'vulnerability', 'larger', 'life', 'exploits', 'lot', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'going', 'good', 'fight', 'heart', 'always', 'right', 'place', 'often', 'described', 'toughest', 'PI', 'television', 'true', 'also', 'emotion', 'mix.If', 'good', 'paper', 'even', 'better', 'screen.This', 'series', 'where', 'actor', 'embodied', 'character', 'alter', 'ego', 'something', 'observed', 'time', 'numerous', 'articles', 'production', 'qualities', 'were', 'very', 'best', 'production', 'company', 'was', 'known', 'not', 'cutting', 'corners', 'golden', 'age', 'television.I', 'know', 'other', 'series', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'such', 'important', 'part', 'episode', 'was', 'hardly', 'supporting', 'cast', 'episodes', 'included', 'mix', 'physical', 'action', 'location', 'shots', 'emotional', 'response', 'close-ups', 'series', 'lasted', 'so', 'long', 'eight', 'full', 'seasons', 'series', 'was', 'back', 'top', '20', 'when', 'was', 'canceled', 'final', 'season', 'still', 'going', 'strong.There', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Mannix', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'was', 'Even', 'better', 'just', 'buy', 'DVDs.Even', 'just', 'few', 'more', 'people', 'there', 'inspired', 'likes', 'Joe', 'Mannix', 'just', 'might', 'do', 'good']",Mannix: The Complete Series

I do get much more out of these now than I did back then. I remember some of the episodes from the second season, and watched some of these from a distant TV station when they were blacked out or pre-empted from our local CBS affiliate. This was the summer of a peak in sunspot activity, and one of my hobbies was to experiment with TV reception. I was able to pull a station in from North Platte, NE to here in Northern CA and actually got the week's episode a couple hours earlier that the airtime would have been here.  This was one episode I remembered where Mannix was up in a helicopter and spotted a man and woman struggling on a balcony, and no one believed him.Picture quality and sound on these is first rate. The remastering makes these look pretty close to BluRay.
