504250,A1TKYAYESYHIA2,B00000INUH,"Elijah Chingosho ""Dr Elijah Chingosho""","[0, 0]","This movie was made in Hong Kong, starring Jet Li, directed by Corey Yuen. Although it is not Jet Li's best, it is nevertheless worth watching.The bodyguard (Jet Li) is assigned to protect the rich Christy Cheung, the only remaining witness to a murder case (the other two witnesses were killed weeks before the trial). At first, they don't get along, largely due to the stiff bodyguard violating her privacy, installing security cameras not only throughout the house but also her bedroom. However, a romantic relationship develops after she violates security procedures and goes shopping, only to be saved from being narrowly killed by several assassins, due to the first rate fighting skills of the bodyguard.The movie starts slowly but it builds up to excellent martial arts towards the end. The major disappointment is that the producers forgot that this was supposed to be a martial arts movie and introduced guns unnecessarily, which spoils the action. The action is not as much as I would have wished. However, the fight, towards the end is first rate, particularly when Jet Li fights Ken Lo (Jackie Chan).However, for those who like guns and also like martial arts, then this movie will excite you.",3,"""What a Bodygaurd!!!""",1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,1206,"['movie', 'was', 'made', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'starring', 'Jet', 'Li', 'directed', 'Corey', 'Yuen', 'not', 'Jet', 'Li', 'best', 'nevertheless', 'worth', 'watching.The', 'bodyguard', 'Jet', 'Li', 'assigned', 'protect', 'rich', 'Christy', 'Cheung', 'only', 'remaining', 'witness', 'murder', 'case', 'other', 'two', 'witnesses', 'were', 'killed', 'weeks', 'trial', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'largely', 'due', 'stiff', 'bodyguard', 'violating', 'privacy', 'installing', 'security', 'cameras', 'not', 'only', 'house', 'also', 'bedroom', 'However', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'security', 'procedures', 'shopping', 'only', 'be', 'saved', 'being', 'narrowly', 'killed', 'several', 'assassins', 'due', 'first', 'rate', 'fighting', 'skills', 'bodyguard.The', 'movie', 'slowly', 'excellent', 'martial', 'arts', 'end', 'major', 'disappointment', 'producers', 'forgot', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'introduced', 'guns', 'unnecessarily', 'action', 'action', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'wished', 'However', 'fight', 'end', 'first', 'rate', 'particularly', 'when', 'Jet', 'Li', 'fights', 'Ken', 'Lo', 'Jackie', 'Chan', '.However', 'who', 'like', 'guns', 'also', 'martial', 'arts', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'excite']",The Bodyguard From Beijing
504251,A7RM685PHBK20,B00000INUH,Eric,"[10, 11]","The Bodyguard from Beijing is the best of all the Jet Li movies I have seen (I have not seen Fist of Legend).  The film marvelously combines romance with grand shootouts and fabulous martial arts action sequences.  The result is dynamite Jet Li.Li stars as Ching, a bodyguard who is sent  from communist China to protect a woman named Michelle Yeung (Christy  Chung) in Hong Kong.  She witnessed a murder committed by a corrupt  businessman and is ready to testify on trial.  She feels her life isn't in  that much danger until they attack her in a mall, where Li invokes the  wrath of an extremely dangerous retired soldier whose brother he  killed.I'm hoping either New Line Cinema or Miramax will pick this film  up and distribute it in the U.S.  There's really no reason not to.  Despite  the fact the plot has been seen before, it's still an extremely enjoyable  movie to watch.As usual, the best aspect of any Jet Li movie is the  action and Bodyguard from Beijing has a lot of it, ranging from the  incredible shootout in the mall to the long action-packed finale inside a  luxurious house that has Jet Li hopping up and down stairs and sliding down  pillars, reloading his gun without even grabbing the clip, while shooting  down badguys all the way.  As awesome as this shootout is the martial arts  fight that comes right after it is even better.  It's a furiously fast  fight that involves Li fighting the retired soldier.  Both men are quick  and very well-trained in the martial arts.  The fight involves them kicking  and punching each other around while trying to get water from a sink  (because of a gas leak).  There's no lack of creativity in this action  sequence as wet cloths and venetian blinds are used as weapons.  The fight  never loses pace or momentum and its movement is consistently fluid.  The  action sequence looks so genuine and well-choreographed beyond most of what  I've seen. It's one of the best martial arts fights I've ever seen on film,  ranking with Jackie Chan's ladder sequence in First Strike, the martial  arts fight atop a building in Who am I?, and the deliriously long fight in  the conclusion of Drunken Master 2.  Much of Bodyguard from Beijing's  success can be given to director Cory Yuen though it all mostly goes to Jet  Li.As for the performances, Jet Li is his usual solid self though is  more fun to watch this time.  Christy Chung delivers a decent performance  as Li's love interest while Kent Cheng is all right in the role of comic  relief.  Ngai Sing is particularly menacing as the villain though his  character should have been in more of the film.  That's really my only  complaint, something most people would find minor.",5,"A fast-paced, fun, and entertaining ride",956016000,"04 18, 2000",2000,2688,"['Bodyguard', 'Beijing', 'best', 'Jet', 'Li', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Fist', 'Legend', 'film', 'marvelously', 'romance', 'grand', 'shootouts', 'fabulous', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'sequences', 'result', 'dynamite', 'Jet', 'Li.Li', 'Ching', 'bodyguard', 'who', 'sent', 'communist', 'China', 'protect', 'woman', 'named', 'Michelle', 'Yeung', 'Christy', 'Chung', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'witnessed', 'murder', 'committed', 'corrupt', 'businessman', 'ready', 'testify', 'trial', 'life', ""n't"", 'much', 'danger', 'attack', 'mall', 'where', 'Li', 'wrath', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'retired', 'soldier', 'brother', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'Miramax', 'will', 'pick', 'film', 'up', 'distribute', 'U.S', 'really', 'reason', 'not', 'fact', 'plot', 'been', 'seen', 'still', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'watch.As', 'usual', 'best', 'aspect', 'Jet', 'Li', 'movie', 'action', 'Bodyguard', 'Beijing', 'lot', 'ranging', 'incredible', 'shootout', 'mall', 'long', 'action-packed', 'finale', 'luxurious', 'house', 'Jet', 'Li', 'hopping', 'up', 'down', 'stairs', 'sliding', 'down', 'pillars', 'reloading', 'gun', 'even', 'grabbing', 'clip', 'shooting', 'down', 'badguys', 'way', 'As', 'awesome', 'shootout', 'martial', 'arts', 'fight', 'right', 'even', 'better', 'furiously', 'fast', 'fight', 'Li', 'fighting', 'retired', 'soldier', 'men', 'are', 'quick', 'very', 'well-trained', 'martial', 'arts', 'fight', 'kicking', 'punching', 'other', 'trying', 'get', 'water', 'sink', 'gas', 'leak', 'lack', 'creativity', 'action', 'sequence', 'wet', 'cloths', 'venetian', 'blinds', 'are', 'used', 'weapons', 'fight', 'never', 'pace', 'momentum', 'movement', 'consistently', 'fluid', 'action', 'sequence', 'so', 'genuine', 'well-choreographed', 'most', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'best', 'martial', 'arts', 'fights', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'ranking', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'ladder', 'sequence', 'First', 'Strike', 'martial', 'arts', 'fight', 'atop', 'building', 'Who', 'am', 'deliriously', 'long', 'fight', 'conclusion', 'Drunken', 'Master', '2', 'Much', 'Bodyguard', 'Beijing', 'success', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'director', 'Cory', 'Yuen', 'mostly', 'Jet', 'Li.As', 'performances', 'Jet', 'Li', 'usual', 'solid', 'self', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'time', 'Christy', 'Chung', 'decent', 'performance', 'Li', 'love', 'interest', 'Kent', 'Cheng', 'right', 'role', 'comic', 'relief', 'Ngai', 'Sing', 'particularly', 'menacing', 'villain', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'film', 'really', 'only', 'complaint', 'something', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'find', 'minor']",The Bodyguard From Beijing

504254,A2IHIAOD10XFN9,B00000INUH,L. A. Adolf,"[8, 9]","Jet Li portrays John Chang, a mainland Chinese bodyguard trained by the military to be the best and latest word in protection.  After using a controversial technique in a training exercise, he is diverted from taking a coveted assignment with his comrades. Instead he is sent to Hong Kong to protect a young woman, Michelle, who is the only surviving witness to a murder.  Michelle is the mistress of a wealthy man, who spares no expense at protecting her life after two other witnesses are murdered by the triad leader suspect's gang.Li's John Chang  is all business, a repressed, grim faced young man who has one objective:  to protect his client, even at the cost of his own life.  His vibrant charge soon finds his protective restrictions stifling and she sets about making life as difficult as possible for the man charged to protect her.  It is not until an attempt is made upon her life in a shopping mall she has stubbornly insisted on visiting, that she begins to appreciate her no nonsense guardian.Soon, appreciation leads to infatuation, and Michelle turns the full force of her romantic charms on the unsuspecting and emotionally ill-equipped Chang.  She buys him fancy clothes, an expensive watch, finding herself increasingly dissatisfied and impatient with her rich but milquetoast boyfriend. The romantic tension is almost too much for Chang, who finds himself uncharacteristically unable to concentrate on his work as her protector.The gang charged with her annihilation is now led by the brother of one of the gang killed at the shopping mall shootout.  He is intent on revenging his brother by killing John.  Taking advantage of Chang's distraction, he and his crew launch an attack on Michelles seemingly impregnable home which initiates the film's final showdown.Jet Li's martial arts skills take a back seat to gunplay and suspense until the climax of the film.  Li's wushu talents are on full display as he engages in hand to hand combat with his foe.  Intent on not repeating his mistake from the opening training exercise, Chang must now show a willingness to die for his client.Highly entertaining and ultimately more satisfying than Hollywood's The Bodyguard, Jet uses his screen appeal to good advantage in the film.  The supporting players are excellent, especially Kent Cheng as one of two policemen that aid John in protecting Michelle. An excellent viewing choice for those who may not be fans of Li's period wushu pieces, the film will probably disappoint those who crave fight-laden martial arts films.",5,HK take on Hollywood's The Bodyguard pleases,1030752000,"08 31, 2002",2002,2537,"['Jet', 'Li', 'John', 'Chang', 'mainland', 'Chinese', 'bodyguard', 'trained', 'military', 'be', 'best', 'latest', 'word', 'protection', 'using', 'controversial', 'technique', 'training', 'exercise', 'diverted', 'taking', 'coveted', 'assignment', 'comrades', 'Instead', 'sent', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'protect', 'young', 'woman', 'Michelle', 'who', 'only', 'surviving', 'witness', 'murder', 'Michelle', 'mistress', 'wealthy', 'man', 'who', 'expense', 'protecting', 'life', 'two', 'other', 'witnesses', 'are', 'murdered', 'triad', 'leader', 'suspect', 'gang.Li', 'John', 'Chang', 'business', 'repressed', 'grim', 'faced', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'objective', 'protect', 'client', 'even', 'cost', 'own', 'life', 'vibrant', 'charge', 'soon', 'protective', 'restrictions', 'stifling', 'making', 'life', 'as', 'difficult', 'possible', 'man', 'charged', 'protect', 'not', 'attempt', 'made', 'life', 'shopping', 'mall', 'stubbornly', 'insisted', 'visiting', 'appreciate', 'nonsense', 'guardian.Soon', 'appreciation', 'infatuation', 'Michelle', 'full', 'force', 'romantic', 'charms', 'unsuspecting', 'emotionally', 'ill-equipped', 'Chang', 'buys', 'fancy', 'clothes', 'expensive', 'watch', 'finding', 'increasingly', 'dissatisfied', 'impatient', 'rich', 'milquetoast', 'boyfriend', 'romantic', 'tension', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'Chang', 'who', 'uncharacteristically', 'unable', 'concentrate', 'work', 'protector.The', 'gang', 'charged', 'annihilation', 'now', 'led', 'brother', 'one', 'gang', 'killed', 'shopping', 'mall', 'shootout', 'intent', 'revenging', 'brother', 'killing', 'John', 'Taking', 'advantage', 'Chang', 'distraction', 'crew', 'launch', 'attack', 'Michelles', 'seemingly', 'impregnable', 'home', 'film', 'final', 'showdown.Jet', 'Li', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'gunplay', 'suspense', 'climax', 'film', 'Li', 'wushu', 'talents', 'are', 'full', 'display', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'foe', 'Intent', 'not', 'repeating', 'mistake', 'opening', 'training', 'exercise', 'Chang', 'must', 'now', 'show', 'willingness', 'die', 'client.Highly', 'entertaining', 'ultimately', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Hollywood', 'Bodyguard', 'Jet', 'screen', 'appeal', 'good', 'advantage', 'film', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Kent', 'Cheng', 'one', 'two', 'policemen', 'aid', 'John', 'protecting', 'Michelle', 'excellent', 'viewing', 'choice', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fans', 'Li', 'period', 'wushu', 'pieces', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'disappoint', 'who', 'crave', 'fight-laden', 'martial', 'arts', 'films']",The Bodyguard From Beijing

But the rest of the film kind of meanders and acts merely as an average sort of martial arts film. The love interest in the film is a very beautiful woman but has very little in way of acting skill.
