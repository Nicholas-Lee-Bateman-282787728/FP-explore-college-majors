It's a goofy concept, to be certain, but somehow it works. The performances are very funny -- Ted Danson, Joe Pantoliano, Patric Fugit and Tim Blake Nelson are all top-notch here -- and while there really aren't any surprises, that somehow works with the concept as presented. The film gets a little metafictional toward the end, but it's done in such a way that it isn't very distracting or off-putting.

1114353,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000XJ5UEY,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 2]","THE AMATEURS is one of those surprisingly good films that you've never heard of. Some of that is often due to a limited release. Or perhaps to a change in the name of the film. Or perhaps it's loaded with unknown actors. Well two out of three of those are correct.The Amateurs received a limited release here in the States in late 2007. It played for only a few weeks at my local indie theater before vanishing, so I never got a chance to check it out. But it laid in the back of my mind because of something that intrigued me...The name of the film was originally entitled THE MOGULS, and trying to find it under its current name (The Amateurs) could present problems for some DVD viewers. If this is the case, try looking it up under both names and see what you can find.If you find such actors as Jeff Bridges (Iron Man), Tim Blake Nelson (Fido), Ted Danson, William Fichtner (The Dark Knight), Patrick Fugit (Wristcutters), John Hawkes (American Gangster), Brad William Henke (North Country), Glenne Headly (The Namesake), Lauren Graham (Evan Almighty), and Judy Greer (Elizabethtown) in your selection, then you've found the correct film; a surprising number of well-knowns dot this movie.Even more surprising is the film's plot: a township that comes together to put out a pornographic movie, and all the trouble they have getting the production going, the actors/actresses assigned, and why each of them is doing it. Now before you click off and say, ""I don't want to see a movie about making a porno!"" just hang around for a minute, okay? It is and isn't about that. So let's start from the beginning...Andy (Jeff Bridges) is having a bad year. His wife has left him. His son is living with his wife's new husband in their mansion-on-the-corner. And Andy wants to impress his son and to make him feel that he has a father who cares very much for him. But he's an out-of-work loser whose every plan always dissipates. But one bar-drinking day, Andy comes up with the idea of making a porno in his little town of Butterfield Face, but doing it with the cast and support of those in town.Men -- obviously -- flock to the project. Emmett (Patrick Fugit) runs the local video store and loves filming on his digital camera, so he is assigned as the ""cinematographer."" And others fall into various roles as director, producers, and even ""the guy who stands around and watches"" (William Fichtner as Otis). But finding the ladies if tougher. They have no options at first but scouring fast food chains, mattress sellers and the local strip club soon turn up some interesting options.Then there's the script, which is talked about in such laid back terms that I found myself howling with laughter (""Now we need the lesbian scene ...but I don't know any lesbians. Do you?"" and ""We need the obligatory black guys on white girl scene. Anybody know any black guys?"") The flat faces and matter-of-fact comments during these scenes made it seem like they could be ordering a book at a local bookstore rather than talking about intimate sex acts.Of course, disaster strikes the film and all seems lost ...until Andy (Bridges) finds out that he's got a back-up plan and pulls magic out of his ...well ...we'll say hat.The real theme of the movie, though, isn't about making a porno; it's about love between a father and son, and what one father is willing to do in order to make his son proud of him. And it didn't take a porno. Confused? Good. Check out this film and revel in it. It's good. It's surprisingly good.",4,It's Not About Sex...,1220313600,"09 2, 2008",2008,3506,"['AMATEURS', 'one', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'films', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'often', 'due', 'limited', 'release', 'perhaps', 'change', 'name', 'film', 'perhaps', 'loaded', 'unknown', 'actors', 'Well', 'two', 'three', 'are', 'correct.The', 'Amateurs', 'received', 'limited', 'release', 'here', 'States', 'late', '2007', 'played', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'local', 'indie', 'theater', 'vanishing', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'check', 'out', 'laid', 'back', 'mind', 'something', 'intrigued', 'name', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'entitled', 'THE', 'MOGULS', 'trying', 'find', 'current', 'name', 'Amateurs', 'could', 'present', 'problems', 'DVD', 'viewers', 'case', 'try', 'looking', 'up', 'names', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'find.If', 'find', 'such', 'actors', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'Fido', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'Wristcutters', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'American', 'Gangster', 'Brad', 'William', 'Henke', 'North', 'Country', 'Glenne', 'Headly', 'Namesake', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'Evan', 'Almighty', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'Elizabethtown', 'selection', 'then', ""'ve"", 'found', 'correct', 'film', 'surprising', 'number', 'well-knowns', 'dot', 'more', 'surprising', 'film', 'plot', 'township', 'together', 'put', 'out', 'pornographic', 'movie', 'trouble', 'have', 'getting', 'production', 'going', 'actors/actresses', 'assigned', 'why', 'doing', 'Now', 'click', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'making', 'porno', 'just', 'hang', 'around', 'minute', ""n't"", 'So', 'let', 'start', 'beginning', 'Andy', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'having', 'bad', 'year', 'wife', 'left', 'son', 'living', 'wife', 'new', 'husband', 'mansion-on-the-corner', 'Andy', 'impress', 'son', 'make', 'feel', 'father', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'out-of-work', 'loser', 'plan', 'always', 'one', 'bar-drinking', 'day', 'Andy', 'up', 'idea', 'making', 'porno', 'little', 'town', 'Butterfield', 'Face', 'doing', 'cast', 'support', 'town.Men', 'obviously', 'flock', 'project', 'Emmett', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'filming', 'digital', 'camera', 'assigned', 'cinematographer', 'others', 'fall', 'various', 'roles', 'director', 'producers', 'even', 'guy', 'who', 'around', 'watches', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'Otis', 'finding', 'ladies', 'tougher', 'have', 'options', 'first', 'scouring', 'fast', 'food', 'chains', 'mattress', 'sellers', 'local', 'strip', 'club', 'soon', 'turn', 'up', 'interesting', 'options.Then', 'script', 'talked', 'such', 'laid', 'back', 'terms', 'found', 'howling', 'laughter', 'Now', 'need', 'lesbian', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'lesbians', 'Do', 'need', 'obligatory', 'black', 'guys', 'white', 'girl', 'scene', 'Anybody', 'know', 'black', 'guys', 'flat', 'matter-of-fact', 'comments', 'scenes', 'made', 'seem', 'could', 'be', 'ordering', 'book', 'local', 'bookstore', 'rather', 'talking', 'intimate', 'sex', 'acts.Of', 'course', 'disaster', 'strikes', 'film', 'lost', 'Andy', 'Bridges', 'out', 'got', 'back-up', 'plan', 'pulls', 'magic', 'well', ""'ll"", 'say', 'hat.The', 'real', 'theme', 'movie', ""n't"", 'about', 'making', 'porno', 'love', 'father', 'son', 'what', 'one', 'father', 'willing', 'do', 'order', 'make', 'son', 'proud', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'porno', 'Confused', 'Good', 'Check', 'out', 'film', 'revel', 'good', 'surprisingly', 'good']",The Amateurs
1114354,A2GEG8O4FBR9DK,B000XJ5UEY,Brian James,"[1, 7]","This is the worst movie I have ever seen!!!!  Horrific production, terrible quality, terrible actors and a terrible script.  Surprised this movie made it to DVD.  I am amazed that ANYBODY liked this movie!!!!This is a very slow movie and long movie.  The plot is very simplistic; an ordinary man who lives in a small town is determined to make a porno that will make it big and have a great payout.  However, when you watch the movie it will seem that it's a lot of no name actors in a low budget movie where not much happens.  There's no action, really no special effects and no strong humor, maybe some very seldom dumb humor.I am a big movie collector; if it looks good I'll buy it.  In this case, it's a movie that seems to have a relatively good trailer, but it's one of those movies where after you watch it, you find that the trailer consists of the only good parts of the movie (about 30 seconds worth of material).  Of the hundreds of movie I have, this is in the bottom five (not even bottom 10) worst movies I've seen/own.  After having a terrible movie marathon with a friend who was determined beyond a doubt that he had the worst movie (Mars Attacks), even he agreed that this movie was worse.  We couldn't even make it through the whole movie, it was that bad; it was too slow and painfully unwatchable.  After having watched the whole movie myself, I was fine putting this movie away after the first half.  So after a second opinion, the movie's terrible!  Buy Mars Attacks instead, you'll be able to make it through that movie much more easily and there's more humor in that.",1,TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!

1114355,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000XJ5UEY,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 2]","Though it is listed in IMDB as The Moguls, the title was changed to The Amateurs. One title was meant to be ironic and the other is sincere. I think sincere is the way to go, for The Amateurs is nothing if not sincere. Though the subject could be sleazy, it is handled so sweetly--it is the story of an unemployed but sincere man (Jeff Bridges) who inspires his friends in a small town to pull together and against all odds make a movie. A dirty movie.The Dude AbidesBridges will always be known as The Dude from The Big Lebowski, regardless of what other roles he plays. Cast as the President of the United States, he was heard to remark, ""so, The Dude gets to be President."" Now that he has won the best actor Oscar for his portrayal of Country Singer Bad Blake in Crazy Heart, The Dude has finally received some recognition. In The Amateurs, made just before his Oscar win, he has created another great character--he may be an unemployed incompetent, but he has a big heart.Jeff Bridges was finally persuaded to do this project because of the writing. Michael Traeger wrote the script and directed. He was a first time director, but Bridges has had good luck with first time writer/directors because they have usually spent a lot of time thinking about the movie while writing the script, and by the time they get to direct, they have a very good idea of what they're looking for.There is a character in The Amateurs who also wants to be a Writer/Director. He is called Some Idiot. ""Some"" for short. The film within a film was written and directed by ""Some Idiot"" and his directing chair is inscribed ""Some Idiot."" Some Idiot is played by veteran character actor Joe Pantoliano. You might have noticed him in Daredevil, The Adventures of Pluto Nash, The Matrix, Bound, Midnight Run, The Goonies, or Risky Business. He suffers from depression and has written a book and has a web site devoted to helping others with similar issues.Ted Danson plays Moose, who pretends to be a mucho macho he man but is gay. He doesn't really fool anyone. Ted Danson will always be known as Sam Malone, the former ballplayer and current womanizer/bar owner from ""Cheers."" Or ""Becker,"" or the guy on ""Ink,"" or most likely, the guy who was dating Whoopie Goldberg and thought it would be funny to show up with her at a Roast in Blackface and make watermelon jokes. One of his fondest ambitions was to do the same sort of over the top characterization of a gay character. In the context of The Amateurs this is very sweet, because his friends still accept him; in fact they have known all along.Patrick Fugit is best known for playing the young Rolling Stone writer in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous. In Amateurs he plays a film buff that works in a video store and is hired to run the camera. He is also shooting video footage. It is a quiet, nuanced performance. He blends in with his surroundings, and you don't even notice that he's filming everything.Timothy Blake Nelson plays Barney Macklehatton, and in the context of The Amateurs, it is one of the more normal roles. He is the romantic lead who might even get the girl. He usually is cast as a freakish misfit of some kind, such as his role in O, Brother, Where Art Thou? It was a rare opportunity for him, and he relished the chance. Plus, he got to work with Jeff Bridges who is after all, The Dude.William Fichtner is another veteran character actor who was in numerous films that are well known to the film going public: The Dark Knight, The Chumscrubber, Crash, Black Hawk Down, Pearl Harbor, The Perfect Storm, Armageddon, Albino Alligator, Strange Days, Quiz Show, and Malcolm X. Otis, the character he plays, is very enthusiastic about the project but everyone is being asked to put up $2,000 and his assets lack the necessary liquidity:----------Otis: I'm in. Except for no money, it's a no-brainer for me. First off, making a stag film *has* to be a good time. Number two, my hat's off to you. Good job. We can do this. Wha-what are we talking about here? Making a dirty movie - film, whatever, whatever. What does that require? Pointing a camera at a he and a she... he'in and a-she'in.==================He just wants to stand around and watch everything. Is there a job like that? Turns out there is, and he is made an executive producer.Now, they just need talent and some of the actors and actresses in the film within a film are Isaiah Washington who was not the bartender on ""The Love Boat"" but was Dr. Preston Burke on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" the guy who was forced to publicly apologize for insensitive remarks and then fired; Judy Greer, who played Judith's snarky but sexy sister Myra on ""Two and a Half Men;"" Valerie Perrine, from Can't Stop the Music with The Village People; and Glenne Headly, who played Tess Trueheart in Dick Tracy.Other cast members of note are Jeanne Tripplehorn, who played Jackie O. on Grey Gardens, as well as being in *Waterworld* and *Basic Instinct*; Lauren Graham, Lorelai Gilmore of ""The Gilmore Girls"" and currently Sarah Braverman on ""Parenthood;"" Steven Weber, who was Brian Michael Hackett on ""Wings;"" and Brad Garrett who was Robert Barone on ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" Though the rest of the cast of The Amateurs were less well known, and in fact may have actually been amateurs, they also provided strong contributions to the success of the project.The Bottom Line is The Amateurs is a very likeable indie film about making a film. For a film about making a dirty movie it is surprisingly sweet. Along with the amateurs, there is some very big talent, like Oscar winning actor Jeff Bridges -- The Dude. He pulls the whole thing together.------------Otis: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.==============The Big Lebowski(1998) Jeff Bridges was Jeffrey Lebowski - The DudeO Brother, Where Art Thou?(2000) Tim Blake Nelson was DelmarDaredevil (Director's Cut)(2003) Joe Pantoliano was Ben UrichThe Chumscrubber(2005) William Fichtner was Mr. Bill StiffleGetting Even With Dad(1994) Ted Danson was Raymond 'Ray' Gleason; and Glenne Headly was Detective Theresa WalshWristcutters - A Love Story(2006) John Hawkes was Yan; and Patrick Fugit was ZiaBreakfast of Champions(1999) Dawn Didawick was Lottie; and Glenne Headly was Francine PefkoTime Code(2000) Jeanne Tripplehorn was Lauren Hathaway; Glenne Headly was the Therapist; and Steven Weber was Darren FetzerVillage People - Can't Stop the Music(1980) Valerie Perrine was Samantha SimpsonElizabethtown DVD(2005) Judy Greer was Heather Baylor--------------Andy Sargentee: I don't do, Ok, I try.

If this hadn't come on tv & there hadn't been anything else to watch or do, I probably wouldn't have watched this movie. I do enjoy Jeff Bridges, but some of his stuff is hit & miss. Plus it's hard to watch him now & not compare his every non-villain role to his character of Lebowski. After watching this film, I'm glad I watched it. It's really very cute & will get overlooked by many.The film follows a group of friends who decide to make a porno. Leading the group is Andy, a guy who has given up on a lot in his life, including his marriage. Along for the ride are a group of guys that include a man who goes by the name of ""Some Guy"" as well as a young man who records just about everything he sees. They all agree to help for their own personal reasons, some of which are obvious & others which develop slowly throughout the film.Honestly, this movie was cute. It's not something I'd rush out & buy, but it is something I'd recommend a friend to watch at some point in time. The characters are nice, but at the same time they didn't really reach out to me all that much. As the saying goes, ""it's not quite milk, but not yet a shake"".

Pauzer,"[46, 47]","The low-key effect of the film grabbed my attention from the beginning as actor Jeff Bridges began his narration of his life in the little town of Butterface Field. He introduced the characters while playing his character engaged in troubled thought, sitting alone, in the local restaurant bar.Bridges is Andy Sargentee, a husband and father who places his impulses above the economic viability of the family by relieving himself on the desks of every supervisor he has had (and despises). His wife, played by Jeanne Triplehorn, sets off into divorce and the sunset with the station wagon and their son.Bridges only support now is the town of Butterface Field, the place in which he was born and raised. The townsfolk know him well enough especially when he is about to come up with a brainstorm, which they are apprehensive about. Friends and neighbors at adjacent tables see the mental storm brewing.  (He led them into a Ponzi scheme before just when the tulip bubble bubbled, proving his brainstorm nothing more than a light drizzle).But now, he's got it!He and the town will make a fortune creating a genuine, amateur porn film! He quickly enlists his friends to invest their meager sum and even more meager talents as actors, writers, directors and so on. They also have to get girls for the part, and enlist Black actors for their presumed assets. They find a young, counter girl from an ice cream store, an aging stripper, and a bedding store saleswoman, who insists on getting it on with the storeowner.Jeff Bridges, Ted Danson, Joe Pantoliano, William Fichtner, Lauren Graham, Glenne Headley, Tim Blake Nelson, and Jeanne Tripplehorn make this ""light"" film work along with the superb direction of Michael Traegor.

Andy Sargentee (Jeff Bridges) just cannot seem to connect. He can't see eye to eye with a nine to five type gig. He's divorced but not because they had horrible problems. She simply got tired of watching him miss the target. She is now married to a really rich guy and has custody of their son who loves his dad more than his new, rich surroundings. Andy has hosted a series of failed business  ventures with his buddies and other residents of their really small town. He now has the mega idea for him and his buds to go in on making a porn movie. A few of the group know just enough to get it started, but their inexperience proves to be nearly insurmountable.This is a good-hearted film which is more than underlined with the final song. Though more motivated, Bridges' character is a short putt from ""The Big Lebowski."" What is going on here is the idea of friendship and acceptance. None of these guys is a success by normal, Western, capitalist standards. And though they've been burnt by past Bridges' failed ideas they still get on board with the new one. The rub here is that these are genuinely decent guys trying to do something that isn't suited to them. Making a porn film demands a more calloused set of sensibilities. They don't even feel comfortable watching the action they are filming. So of course it is doomed to fail. But in that failure emerges their greater triumph and makes them closer than they were in the beginning.The cast is great and all do a good job. These actors must have all worked for less than their standard rate because this is a modestly budgeted outing that I cannot imagine would normally support them. But they all work well together and you're pulling for them in the end. Though modest, it's directed, shot and cut as good as it needed to be. Comparisons to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" have been made.

1114364,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000XJ5UEY,Grady Harp,"[38, 41]","THE AMATEURS is about as close to the quality of British film comedies (a high compliment indeed!) as we have seen, thanks to writer/director Michael Traeger.  It is everything a small town community aura represents without the stumbling blocks of cruelty that so often provide the turning point in 'rural stories' that defame the simple homespun humanity that is too often foreign to the big city life. Perhaps to refer to it as 'sweet' will rile some review readers, but for this viewer the overriding emotion at the close of the story is just that - sweet, in the finest sense of the term.The film is narrated by the down and out, unemployed, newly divorced middle-aged crisis victim Andy Sargentee (Jeff Bridges) who spends his time in the local watering hole trying to come up with an idea that will change his fortune - and life. Giving up his marriage to Thelma (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and his son Billy (Alex D. Linz) has been painful but Andy believes he will somehow regain their respect by discovering his 'big idea'. Surrounding him are other underachievers such as Some Idiot (Joe Pantoliano), Barney Macklehatton (Tim Blake Nelson) hopelessly in love with loony dreamer Helen (Glenne Headly), church janitor Otis (William Fichtner), local video store worker and video buff Emmett (Patrick Fugit), Moe/Ron (John Hawkes and Brad William Henke) who are never seen alone, the closeted gay Moose (Ted Danson), and bartender Floyd (Tom Bower) among other 'observers'.  A wild idea occurs to Andy: he and his friends could make an amateur porn film and make money and gain fame.  Out of both love of Andy and individual needs to make something of their boring existence in the little town, the group commits to helping Andy with his project.  How the steps succeed and fail underline the integrity and unconditional friendship these simple people represent.  Along the way we meet the porn film's stars including Valerie Perrine, Judy Greer, Fiona Hunter, Isaiah Washington, Melinda Dahl - all of whom eagerly participate in the 'very private' filming concept of an amateur porn film.  How the final product is threatened and ultimately survives produces the warm ending to the film.  And along the way we get to know Thelma's new husband Howard (Steven Weber) who breaks the stereotype of the rich new stepfather, and these small town folk including Dawn Didawick, Jayne Taini, Lauren Graham, and  Eileen Brennan (who contributes a very special cameo role).The film has been named THE MOGULS and DIRTY MOVIE in other countries and perhaps that confusion of titles has been part of the problem of the lack of promotion the film received in the theaters.  But in a way, seeing this very special movie in home surroundings adds to the intimacy and the very warmly honest view of the genuinely kind and caring interrelationships among the people of this small town.  There is much to be learned from this film and the added features include the writer/director sharing the experience with each of the actors in this truly ensemble work.  Highly recommended.

1114372,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000XJ5UEY,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 1]","""The Amateurs"" is an interesting film.  I picked it up in the budget bin; so I bought it rather than renting.  Jeff Bridges is the lead.  He always does interesting work from his Oscar-nominated films ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot,"" ""Starman"" & ""The Contender"" to his romantic comedies like ""The Fabulous Baker Boys.""  Here he plays Andy Sargentee, a down-and-out loser who comes up with the wild idea to make an adult film.  Tim Blake Nelson who was inO Brother, Where Art Thou?plays his shy friend and sidekick Barney who helps produce the movie.  In the DVD extras, Nelson relates how he relished playing a role where he winds up with the girl.  Glenne Headly plays that girl, Helen Tatalbaum, who Barney repeatedly tries to approach.  Headley was recently inComeback Seasonand also appeared in ""Mr. Holland's Opus.""  Patrick Fugit plays the cameraman Emmett who records everything and eventually saves the day.  His DVD extra clowning with William Fichtner was a nice glimpse onto the set.  Fichtner who appeared in ""The Dark Knight"" & the Oscar-winning ""Crash"" plays Andy's buddy Otis who has a knack for securing talent for the film.  He approaches Ellie who sells mattresses and has a crush on her boss.  Judy Greer who was in ""The Wedding Planner"" plays Ellie who jumps on mattresses.  Otis also finds V who is played by Valerie Perrine.  Perrine was one of the most beautiful film actresses in the 70s, receiving her Oscar nomination for ""Lenny"" in 1974.  Joe Pantoliano who I will always remember as the traitor Cypher in the classicThe Matrixplays the film director they call ""Some Idiot.""  That is his character name!  In the DVD extras, Mary Steenburgen who auditioned for the film relates how she urged her husband Ted Danson to play the gay character Moose.  Danson came to our attention along with earning several Golden Globe nominations for the famous TV series ""Cheers"" and won a Golden Globe ""Something About Amelia.""  He says he always wanted to play a gay guy.  The scene where he tries to shoot a scene with V and can't rise to the occasion is as hilarious as it is pitiful.  John Hawkes who was in ""The Perfect Storm"" plays Moe.  He is buddies with Brad Henke's Ron.  Henke was in two films I liked a lot,Must Love Dogs (Widescreen Edition)&Zodiac (Widescreen Edition).  These guys are hilarious, especially as they tear up the motel in a tag-team romantic event.  Mike Binder, who I loved inThe Upside of Anger, has a cameo as Andy's boss.  Isaiah Washington from TV's ""Grey's Anatomy"" & ""Ally McBeal"" plays Homer who is insulted when his size is questioned.  Jeanne Tripplehorn who played opposite Tom Cruise in 1993's ""The Firm"" plays Andy's ex-wife Thelma.  Alex D. Linz does a nice job as Andy's basketball-loving son Billy.  Lauren Graham from TV's ""The Gilmore Girls"" plays Peggy who develops a crush on Andy.  Michael Traeger directs his first feature.  He's moderately successful in pulling the film together.  Somehow, it doesn't completely seem to engage.  The film was released in the United Kingdom under the title ""The Moguls,"" but went direct to DVD stateside.

The plot moves along at a good pace with interesting characters; and the screenplay is very creative and well done. Fans of Jeff Bridges, Ted Danson and the other talented actors in this flick are sure to love it.The Amateurs begins by introducing us to Andy Sargentee (Jeff Bridges) who is a middle aged, unsuccessful and frustrated man who never seems to be able to hold a job. It costs him his wife and kid; and his friends at the local watering hole don't seem to offer him much help in achieving his goals of an ""accomplishment,"" either. Just when things look absolutely hopeless for Andy, he comes up with an idea--he'll make an adult movie! Trouble is, however, Andy and his friends ""Moose"" (Ted Danson), Otis (William Fichtner), a guy everyone calls ""Some Idiot"" (Joe Pantoliano) and others lack the money and the cast for Andy's film to become a reality.Soon, however, people in the small town where Andy and his buddies live slowly become interested in the idea. Andy gets guys on board to shoot the film (look for a great performance by Patrick Fugit as Emmett, the young man with the video camera), write the script (they really needed one?) and eventually they find a handful of ladies willing to participate, too.Will Andy and his buddies, along with the cast, find fame and fortune after making their adult flick? Will it ever be completed--it can be tough to do ""casting"" for this type of film in the small town Andy lives in. And, if it IS completed, will it sell and make money for them all? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!The DVD comes with commentaries and the ""behind the scenes"" extra is a very informative and entertaining look at how they really made this picture.I highly recommend this film for fans of more independent films; but it also can appeal to mainstream audiences with such a great cast. Jeff Bridges and Ted Danson are absolutely excellent.Overall, get this film and enjoy it today!

1114378,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B000XJ5UEY,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[4, 4]","In 2004 Joe Pantoliano starred in a great little movie called ""Second Best"" in which he played the leader of a bunch of losers whose lot is never going to change.  In 2005 he starred in another movie with a similar theme, but this time the losers win in the end.  This second movie, originally released as ""The Moguls"", is now making the rounds of the video stores under its rechristened title, ""The Amateurs,"" and it is a charming, disarming flick that will take you by surprise.This time, rather than Pantoliano, the lead loser is Jeff Bridges, a guy for whom simply nothing goes particularly well.  Unable to keep a job, divorced by his wife, in danger of losing the affections of his son and apparently completely beaten, he is nonetheless dogged in his belief that there must be SOMETHING he can do right in this life...and is inexplicably more than amply sustained in this fantasy by his own personal corps of loser, played notably by Pantoliano, Tim Blake Nelson, William Fichtner, and Ted Danson, as well as the rest of the town's fruitcake population, many of whom are losers in their own right.Bridges' character, Andy, after much thought, finally comes up with an idea that he is absolutely positive will put them all on the map, and put much needed money into all their pockets.  They should, he announces, make a porno film; what could be simpler?The fact that this crew knows nothing about film, and worse, knows nothing about porn, sets the stage for what follows. As their Stranger in a Strange Land journey continues, Andy undertakes an academic study of the sort of scenes they'll need in their movie, Pantolaino is rendered speechless by a collection of sex toys, and, in a clear send up of his Sam Malone character on ""Cheers,"" Danson proves not to be a ladies man at all.One bit of pure genius occurs when, although played with a straightforward, small town earnestness, the film takes a Mel Brooks turn to absurdity as the stumbling, bumbling crew is amazed and tickled at their ability to find several more-then-willing local women to star in the film, but at the same time can't seem to find any well-endowed black males, or a single white male willing to play any part in the film at all, in spite of offers of payment and free sex.This film was obviously a labor of love, as Hollywood stars such as Valerie Perrine, Eileen Brennan, Steven Weber, Brad Garrett and Judy Greer turn in marvelous, if extremely small performances, each adding a special something to the film.Although this is a film about a sex film, there is literally nothing sexual about it, the small amount of nudity handled with wit and charm.Although at times the film is downright silly, it is in the end uplifting, and simply a good movie.  If you did not see it during its initial run as ""The Moguls,"" by all means see it as ""The Amateurs.""  You'll be pleasantly surprised.",4,Lovable Losers...who win,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,2870,"['2004', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'starred', 'great', 'little', 'movie', 'called', 'Second', 'Best', 'played', 'leader', 'bunch', 'losers', 'lot', 'never', 'going', 'change', '2005', 'starred', 'movie', 'similar', 'theme', 'time', 'losers', 'win', 'end', 'second', 'movie', 'originally', 'released', 'Moguls', 'now', 'making', 'rounds', 'video', 'stores', 'rechristened', 'title', 'Amateurs', 'charming', 'disarming', 'flick', 'will', 'take', 'surprise.This', 'time', 'rather', 'Pantoliano', 'lead', 'loser', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'guy', 'whom', 'simply', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'well', 'Unable', 'keep', 'job', 'divorced', 'wife', 'danger', 'losing', 'affections', 'son', 'apparently', 'completely', 'beaten', 'nonetheless', 'dogged', 'belief', 'must', 'be', 'can', 'do', 'right', 'life', 'inexplicably', 'more', 'amply', 'sustained', 'fantasy', 'own', 'personal', 'corps', 'loser', 'played', 'notably', 'Pantoliano', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'town', 'fruitcake', 'population', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'losers', 'own', 'right.Bridges', 'character', 'Andy', 'much', 'thought', 'finally', 'up', 'idea', 'absolutely', 'positive', 'will', 'put', 'map', 'put', 'much', 'needed', 'money', 'pockets', 'should', 'make', 'porno', 'film', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'simpler', 'fact', 'crew', 'nothing', 'film', 'worse', 'nothing', 'porn', 'stage', 'what', 'Stranger', 'Strange', 'Land', 'journey', 'Andy', 'academic', 'study', 'sort', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'need', 'movie', 'Pantolaino', 'rendered', 'speechless', 'collection', 'sex', 'toys', 'clear', 'send', 'Sam', 'Malone', 'character', 'Cheers', 'Danson', 'not', 'be', 'ladies', 'man', 'all.One', 'bit', 'pure', 'genius', 'when', 'played', 'straightforward', 'small', 'town', 'earnestness', 'film', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'turn', 'absurdity', 'stumbling', 'bumbling', 'crew', 'amazed', 'tickled', 'ability', 'find', 'several', 'more-then-willing', 'local', 'women', 'star', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'well-endowed', 'black', 'males', 'single', 'white', 'male', 'willing', 'play', 'part', 'film', 'spite', 'offers', 'payment', 'free', 'sex.This', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'labor', 'love', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'such', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'turn', 'marvelous', 'extremely', 'small', 'performances', 'adding', 'special', 'something', 'film.Although', 'film', 'sex', 'film', 'literally', 'nothing', 'sexual', 'small', 'amount', 'nudity', 'handled', 'wit', 'charm.Although', 'times', 'film', 'downright', 'silly', 'end', 'uplifting', 'simply', 'good', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'initial', 'run', 'Moguls', 'means', 'see', 'Amateurs', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised']",The Amateurs

Early on we find that he lost his wife because he's just not able to be responsible and can't take care of his family because of his lack of steady income.  His son's birthday comes up and he goes to the store to buy a gift for him only to realize he just can't afford the one he feels is right.  Real embarassment kicks in when he goes to his wife's new home and finds that it isn't just a big home, it's a complete mansion.From that embarassment springs inspiration as Andy sits deep in thought in the town bar.  Eventually he's inspired to make a porn movie with the help and support of his friends, a cast of some of the weirdest and wildest characters you'd ever find assembled.This film isn't a continuous laugh fest, but it is very entertaining.  Some parts would seem predictable, but the story does a good job of planting timely distractions and diversions along the way that keep things very fresh.While the movie is about the making of a porn film, the nudity in the film is fairly tasteful and there is no sex really shown in the film.  There are however sexual references, sex toys and discussion of porn movies is prevalent so this isn't a film for the easily disturbed.Well worth a purchase and priced at a fair level.",4,A quirky film with an excellent cast,1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,1603,"['ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'up', '5', 'star', 'level', 'awfully', 'close.Big', 'props', 'cast', 'here', 'really', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'seem', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'roles', 'asked', 'play.Lead', 'actor', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'great', 'performance', 'man', 'Andy', 'Sargentee', 'looking', 'one', 'big', 'break', 'unfortunately', 'failed', 'everything', 'ever', 'tried', 'Early', 'find', 'lost', 'wife', 'just', 'not', 'able', 'be', 'responsible', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'care', 'family', 'lack', 'steady', 'income', 'son', 'birthday', 'up', 'store', 'buy', 'gift', 'only', 'realize', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'one', 'right', 'Real', 'embarassment', 'kicks', 'when', 'wife', 'new', 'home', ""n't"", 'just', 'big', 'home', 'complete', 'mansion.From', 'embarassment', 'springs', 'inspiration', 'Andy', 'deep', 'thought', 'town', 'bar', 'Eventually', 'inspired', 'make', 'porn', 'movie', 'help', 'support', 'friends', 'cast', 'weirdest', 'wildest', 'characters', ""'d"", 'ever', 'find', 'assembled.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'continuous', 'laugh', 'fest', 'very', 'entertaining', 'parts', 'would', 'seem', 'predictable', 'story', 'good', 'job', 'planting', 'timely', 'distractions', 'diversions', 'way', 'keep', 'things', 'very', 'fresh.While', 'movie', 'making', 'porn', 'film', 'nudity', 'film', 'fairly', 'tasteful', 'sex', 'really', 'shown', 'film', 'are', 'however', 'sexual', 'references', 'sex', 'toys', 'discussion', 'porn', 'movies', 'prevalent', ""n't"", 'film', 'easily', 'disturbed.Well', 'purchase', 'priced', 'fair', 'level']",The Amateurs
