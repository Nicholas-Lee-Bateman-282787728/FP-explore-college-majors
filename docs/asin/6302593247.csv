321753,AQUU8S55JGY2H,6302593247,Aco,"[10, 13]","The William Gibson play-cum-film Two for the Seesaw was on TCM recently, and being a Robert Mitchum fan I wanted to see it. Not to mention Shirley MacLaine (yes, she's been around forever!), Robert Wise (his first post-West Side Story direction) and Andre Previn doing the music.But little did I know that the music and the cinematography (by Ted D. McCord) would be the best part of this film. Both were nominated for Academy Awards, they stand out so much-not that Mitchum and MacLaine, who dominate this two-hander almost totally, were terrible, to the contrary-that the movie became more of a celebration of New York in glorious black & white, and the jazz score a stunning evokation of the tumult of star-crossed love.I certainly was surprised by Mitchum's settled and reserved performance here, as a seperated wandering Nebraskan lawyer who falls hard for a younger dancer. His characteristic muscularity or physical imposition is covered by a sharp suit the whole time, and the internal strife of his instability-which is only exacerbated by MacLaine's Gittel, her immaturity and vibrance-combined for a distinct performance in the Mitchum canon. MacLaine by the way is very cute and spunky here, sharp and vulnerable, & but for her nasally whim and inflections, she is also excellent.But the cinematography of Ted D. McCord and the music of Andre Previn are the highlights here. In fact I later realized that Two for the Seesaw was on TCM because of it's brilliant cinematography, scheduled along with To Catch a Thief, Black Narcissus, A Farewell to Arms, all of which won Oscars for cinematography, and The Facts of Life, which was also nominated....",3,"Mitchum+MacLaine on the marquee, Music+Cinematography are the substance",1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,1660,"['William', 'Gibson', 'play-cum-film', 'Two', 'Seesaw', 'was', 'TCM', 'recently', 'being', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'fan', 'wanted', 'see', 'Not', 'mention', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'yes', 'been', 'forever', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'first', 'post-West', 'Side', 'Story', 'direction', 'Andre', 'Previn', 'doing', 'music.But', 'little', 'did', 'know', 'music', 'cinematography', 'Ted', 'D.', 'McCord', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'were', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'stand', 'out', 'so', 'much-not', 'Mitchum', 'MacLaine', 'who', 'dominate', 'two-hander', 'almost', 'totally', 'were', 'terrible', 'contrary-that', 'movie', 'became', 'more', 'celebration', 'New', 'York', 'glorious', 'black', 'white', 'jazz', 'score', 'stunning', 'evokation', 'tumult', 'star-crossed', 'love.I', 'certainly', 'was', 'surprised', 'Mitchum', 'settled', 'reserved', 'performance', 'here', 'seperated', 'wandering', 'Nebraskan', 'lawyer', 'who', 'hard', 'younger', 'dancer', 'characteristic', 'muscularity', 'physical', 'imposition', 'covered', 'sharp', 'suit', 'whole', 'time', 'internal', 'strife', 'instability-which', 'only', 'exacerbated', 'MacLaine', 'Gittel', 'immaturity', 'vibrance-combined', 'distinct', 'performance', 'Mitchum', 'canon', 'MacLaine', 'way', 'very', 'cute', 'spunky', 'here', 'sharp', 'vulnerable', 'nasally', 'whim', 'inflections', 'also', 'excellent.But', 'cinematography', 'Ted', 'D.', 'McCord', 'music', 'Andre', 'Previn', 'are', 'highlights', 'here', 'fact', 'later', 'realized', 'Two', 'Seesaw', 'was', 'TCM', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'scheduled', 'Catch', 'Thief', 'Black', 'Narcissus', 'A', 'Farewell', 'Arms', 'won', 'Oscars', 'cinematography', 'Facts', 'Life', 'was', 'also', 'nominated']",Two for the Seesaw VHS

The film is a tad dated but does offer a kernel of truth about the complications of two very flawed people trying to connect.Adapted from a stage play, the film version suffers from overlong dialogue and the bad casting of Mitchum, who is too taciturn and disaffected to be remotely engaging. He usually plays tough guys, and while he has his appeal, he just doesn&#8217;t work here as a romantic lead. In the mouth of someone like Richard Burton or Jack Lemmon, Jerry Ryan&#8217;s lines might sound clever or charming, but Mitchum sounds like a grim, depressive, controlling abuser (and he does manipulate and smack Gittel a few times &#8211; and in those politically incorrect times, she just takes it). MacLaine, who is excellent as usual, affects some New Yawk Jewish girl quirks as Gittel Mosca, a free-spirited but struggling former dancer who calls &#8216;em like she sees &#8216;em but still gives, gives, gives.It&#8217;s hard to understand how she and displaced Nebraska lawyer Jerry get together in the first place, considering that WASPy Jerry&#8212;in Big Apple self-exile while his wife divorces him-- only reaches out because he has no other options. Gittel is merely curious. For her, Jerry is just the latest in a string of bad relationships that she kills by being way too accommodating (something I can relate to). And Jerry is slumming, trying to make up through easy-breezy Gittel for everything he failed to do in his marriage. There is no way this is going to last. Not only are they culturally miles apart, Jerry is in his 40s and Gittel is just 29; further, Jerry has a law degree while Gittel &#8211; though no dummy &#8211; only finished high school. Once they throw in together, they try to make it work by shoring each other up through thick and thin, but it&#8217;s no use. Gittel knows she can&#8217;t hold him, and sabotages the relationship by sleeping with someone else. They both know he&#8217;s still in love with his wife. They end it, and manage to stay friends.I think that&#8217;s what I like about the film, finally, though I&#8217;m not sure I would sit through it again: Some relationships are only meant to last for a season, and once we understand that, there&#8217;s no need for recriminations. Breaking up is never easy, fun, or happy. But Jerry and Gittel are very clear that though it didn&#8217;t last, they are both far better people for the experience.",4,Some relationships are only meant to last for a season . . .,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,2525,"['story', 'two', 'misfits', 'managing', 'bumpy', 'doomed', 'romance', 'early', '1960s', 'New', 'York', 'photographed', 'moody', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'tad', 'dated', 'offer', 'kernel', 'truth', 'complications', 'two', 'very', 'flawed', 'people', 'trying', 'connect.Adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'film', 'version', 'suffers', 'overlong', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'casting', 'Mitchum', 'who', 'too', 'taciturn', 'disaffected', 'be', 'remotely', 'engaging', 'usually', 'tough', 'guys', 'appeal', 'just', 'doesn', '8217', 'work', 'here', 'romantic', 'lead', 'mouth', 'someone', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Jerry', 'Ryan', '8217', 'lines', 'might', 'sound', 'clever', 'charming', 'Mitchum', 'grim', 'depressive', 'controlling', 'abuser', 'manipulate', 'smack', 'Gittel', 'few', 'times', '8211', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'times', 'just', 'MacLaine', 'who', 'excellent', 'usual', 'New', 'Yawk', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'quirks', 'Gittel', 'Mosca', 'free-spirited', 'struggling', 'former', 'dancer', 'who', '8216', '8216', 'still', 'gives.It', '8217', 's', 'hard', 'understand', 'how', 'displaced', 'Nebraska', 'lawyer', 'Jerry', 'get', 'together', 'first', 'place', 'considering', 'WASPy', 'Jerry', '8212', 'Big', 'Apple', 'self-exile', 'wife', 'only', 'out', 'other', 'options', 'Gittel', 'merely', 'curious', 'Jerry', 'just', 'latest', 'string', 'bad', 'relationships', 'being', 'way', 'too', 'accommodating', 'something', 'can', 'relate', 'Jerry', 'slumming', 'trying', 'make', 'up', 'easy-breezy', 'Gittel', 'everything', 'failed', 'do', 'marriage', 'way', 'going', 'last', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'culturally', 'miles', 'apart', 'Jerry', '40s', 'Gittel', 'just', '29', 'further', 'Jerry', 'law', 'degree', 'Gittel', '8211', 'dummy', '8211', 'only', 'finished', 'high', 'school', 'throw', 'together', 'try', 'make', 'work', 'shoring', 'other', 'up', 'thick', 'thin', '8217', 'use', 'Gittel', 'can', '8217', 'hold', 'relationship', 'sleeping', 'someone', 'else', 'know', '8217', 's', 'still', 'love', 'wife', 'end', 'manage', 'stay', 'friends.I', 'think', '8217', 's', 'what', 'like', 'film', 'finally', '8217', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'sit', 'again', 'relationships', 'are', 'only', 'meant', 'last', 'season', 'once', 'understand', '8217', 'need', 'recriminations', 'Breaking', 'up', 'never', 'easy', 'fun', 'happy', 'Jerry', 'Gittel', 'are', 'very', 'clear', '8217', 't', 'last', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'people', 'experience']",Two for the Seesaw VHS

First of all it seems that all the DVD's out there (the only non DVD-R versions, like Amazon offers, are Region 2) are cut down to full screen instead of giving us the very effective use of the original widescreen. Sin one, as the exceptional camera work drew an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography.It also appears that the DVD version may have been edited to de-emphasize the pretty blatant sexuality and passion, as it seems to have been marketed after the Sixties as a light hearted romantic comedy. Sin two. It's hardly funny. It's a serious, heart wrenching drama.I just watched the original version on TCM and was blown away by it, especially by Shirley Maclaine's compelling performance, for which she also received an Oscar nomination.Perhaps we can someday look forward to a restored version of the original work.

321756,A1FDW1SPYKB354,6302593247,David Von Pein,"[10, 12]","Robert Mitchum and Shirley MacLaine star in ""Two For The Seesaw"", which is a movie that I enjoyed very much. It's refreshing to see Mitchum in a softer (and non-violent) role. (Although, Bob does manage to get in one good whack in this film. But, Shirley gets him back [twice] later in the picture.)Mr. Mitchum was a very busy actor in the early 1960s, with ""Seesaw"" already representing his 8th film during the still-very-young decade of the '60s. The first seven being: ""Home From The Hill"" (1960), ""A Terrible Beauty"" (1960), ""The Sundowners"" (1960), ""The Grass Is Greener"" (1960), ""The Last Time I Saw Archie"" (1961), ""Cape Fear"" (1962), and ""The Longest Day"" (1962).With just one film in between, Mitchum went from portraying hardened criminal ""Max Cady"" in ""Cape Fear"", to his role as a gentle lawyer in ""Two For The Seesaw"". Mitch's superb versatility was never more apparent than in those two 1962 films.MacLaine and Mitchum are on screen for very nearly the entire 1 hour and 59 minutes here, and (IMO) treat us to some very good, on-target, realistic dialogue. And the ending was a bit of a twist, which is another big plus.One line in the script that I particularly thought hit the mark was when Shirley berates Robert with: ""Who needs to work THAT hard if things [in a relationship] are going right?!"". Makes good sense. There are several clever lines like that in the film.As I watched this film, I kept being reminded of ""The Hustler"" (1961), which is very similar in pace, style, and looks. The small confines of the drab apartments and the overall dark visuals are very much the same in both movies.The black-and-white ""Seesaw"" premiered in movie theaters on November 21, 1962, and was one of 41 films directed by the distinguished Robert Wise (with ""Seesaw"" being sandwiched between two of his other highly-notable directorial efforts -- ""West Side Story"" in 1961 and ""The Haunting"" in '63).Featuring two standout acting talents and one of the best directors in the biz calling the shots behind the cameras, ""Two For The Seesaw"" is certainly a motion picture worth seeing.",4,"""Two For The Seesaw"": Reminds Me Of ""The Hustler"" (But Without The Billiards)",1034899200,"10 18, 2002",2002,2089,"['Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'star', 'Two', 'Seesaw', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Mitchum', 'softer', 'non-violent', 'role', 'Bob', 'manage', 'get', 'one', 'good', 'whack', 'film', 'Shirley', 'back', '[', 'twice', ']', 'later', 'picture.', 'Mr', 'Mitchum', 'was', 'very', 'busy', 'actor', 'early', '1960s', 'Seesaw', 'already', 'representing', '8th', 'film', 'still-very-young', 'decade', ""'60s"", 'first', 'seven', 'being', 'Home', 'Hill', '1960', 'Terrible', 'Beauty', '1960', 'Sundowners', '1960', 'Grass', 'Is', 'Greener', '1960', 'Last', 'Time', 'Saw', 'Archie', '1961', 'Cape', 'Fear', '1962', 'Longest', 'Day', '1962', '.With', 'just', 'one', 'film', 'Mitchum', 'went', 'portraying', 'hardened', 'criminal', 'Max', 'Cady', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'role', 'gentle', 'lawyer', 'Two', 'Seesaw', 'Mitch', 'superb', 'versatility', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'apparent', 'two', '1962', 'films.MacLaine', 'Mitchum', 'are', 'screen', 'very', 'nearly', 'entire', '1', 'hour', '59', 'minutes', 'here', 'IMO', 'treat', 'very', 'good', 'on-target', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'twist', 'big', 'plus.One', 'line', 'script', 'particularly', 'thought', 'hit', 'mark', 'was', 'when', 'Shirley', 'Robert', 'Who', 'work', 'THAT', 'hard', 'things', '[', 'relationship', ']', 'are', 'going', 'right', 'Makes', 'good', 'sense', 'are', 'several', 'clever', 'lines', 'film.As', 'watched', 'film', 'kept', 'being', 'reminded', 'Hustler', '1961', 'very', 'similar', 'pace', 'style', 'small', 'confines', 'drab', 'apartments', 'overall', 'dark', 'visuals', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'movies.The', 'black-and-white', 'Seesaw', 'premiered', 'movie', 'theaters', 'November', '21', '1962', 'was', 'one', '41', 'films', 'directed', 'distinguished', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'Seesaw', 'being', 'sandwiched', 'two', 'other', 'highly-notable', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', '1961', 'Haunting', ""'63"", '.Featuring', 'two', 'standout', 'acting', 'talents', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'biz', 'calling', 'shots', 'cameras', 'Two', 'Seesaw', 'certainly', 'motion', 'picture', 'seeing']",Two for the Seesaw VHS

One of those dreadful Sixties Dramas (please note the portentious use of Capital Letters) that are Boldly Adapted from a Stage Play, and full of Psychology-laden monologues and horrendously overwritten, absurdly unnatural-sounding repartee. Shirley MacLaine is a ""bohemian"" Jewish girl, living in the nutty clamour of Greenwich Village (which we see very little of, sadly), and Robert Mitchum is the ""square"" from Omaha who barges into her life and begins bossing her around, in an effort to recapture his Lost Masculinity. The film is interminable and way too stagey. MacLaine has some winsome moments, and the B&W cinematography is kinda nice, but nothing can save this overly-mannered shipwreck from foundering, again and again, on the shoals of its own pretensions.

It has two first rate actors, a great director, and interesting story, so why do I give it only 4 stars? Because the format is non anamorphic. I thought this had already been settled. A non anamorphic transfer can only play well on an older 4 by 3 T.V. set (I don't know if they still make them). On a high definition set, half the picture image is reduced (there are black bars entirely around the image and it is about half the size it would be if it were anamorphic - 'enhanced' is another term used for anamorphic) and there is some loss of clarity. If it is a matter of cost, we are already paying a premium price and for it, we should get the best possible picture.

His strong, forceful ""man in control"" persona comes through very well.  Unfortunately, that's the major problem I had with ""Two for the Seesaw"" because the lead male role calls, in my opinion, for a more bewildered man.  Consider the plot's premise; A middle-aged lawyer from Nebraska comes to New York City to escape his marital problems at home.  He meets a Greenich Village-type woman who's his complete oppostite and they attempt to have a normal relationship.  I looked up the history of this play and Dana Andrews as well as Henry Fonda (a REAL Nebraska fellow) played the part on stage.  Without knowing for sure, I presume that they brought a humorous sort of ""Gee Whiz"" bewilderment at not only the big city but the strange folks that live there.  I presume that this made this comedy a funnier presentation than Mitchum's ""ho-hum, nothing gets in my way"" approach.  With his leading role, the rest of the cast had to put together whatever humor they could salvage.  Maybe I'm missing the playwrite's purpose; maybe he meant to show a man buckled under by others controlling his life who becomes a person looking for someone he could control.  I think not.OK that's out of the way, now for the positives.  Mitchum and MacLaine work very well together and create a very interesting relationship.  As I said, this is one of his best ""Robert Mitchum"" preformances.  There is a good supporting cast but it's essentially a two person show.  There is a soundtrack that is outstanding.  Whoever was playing that trumpet has a knack for jazzy blues.  I was absorbed in the movie but I kept thinking that someone was coming on too strong.

321763,A704NAPK5K1DC,6302593247,RareRare,"[20, 23]","Like Helen Morgan's ""Applause"", the film version of ""Two For the Seesaw"" gives its viewers a seldom seen look at the real theatre world of New York City in the 20th Century. This is a gritty, realistic love story on the cold, hard streets of New York that somehow is still able to show the real romance of the giant city. Not unlike the neo-realism of Fellini, Viscounti and Pausolini, ""Two for the Seesaw"" shows how actors and artists romatically collide with everyday people as they barely hang onto their dreams. Shirlely MacLaine lived this life before ""The Pajama Game"" and probably had friends like Gittel Mosca who were still striving for greatness long after MacLaine was a star. And Robert Mitchum, always surprising in roles in which he seemed to be wrongfullly cast, was never better. All this superior quality is magnified in the beauty and clarity of black and white. Don't read the following reviews. Those people have never been in love and working in the theatre in New York. I have and know how right-on this film is. It should be on DVD in widescreen.

The second time I watched this movie it stuck me a little bit more profound then just a love story.Mitchum plays a man, who is dissatisfied with the life that had coddled him, tired of accepting what people handed out to him.  He feels as if he has been given a life of luxury at the cost of his own independence.  He is tired of taking and wants to give what he has to offer.Then we have MacLaine.  A somewhat innocent and a bit naive woman who has a heart as big as the city she lives in.  She gives and gives with no thought or expectations of reciprocation. She is strong and independent. Yet, she is afraid to need someone, to love someone, to let someone give to her.Then these two meet. Mitchum at last has something to offer someone, enjoys giving what he has, and taking care of someone else, instead of him being taken care of.  MacLaine finally has someone to unravel those walls of independence and allows herself to need someone.  It's a beautiful relationship that really reaches out to me.Not only that but Mitchum and MacLaine are magnificent in it.  I love the fact that this was filmed in black and white.  Color would only distract and add unnecessary noise to the message this movie brings to the viewer. So do these two live happy ever after?  Watch it and find out.  :o)",4,A love story ...,973296000,"11 4, 2000",2000,1415,"['first', 'time', 'watched', 'was', 'captivated', 'Mitchum', 'MacLaine', 'together', 'was', 'engrossed', 'love', 'story', 'second', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'stuck', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'profound', 'then', 'just', 'love', 'story.Mitchum', 'man', 'who', 'dissatisfied', 'life', 'had', 'coddled', 'tired', 'accepting', 'what', 'people', 'handed', 'out', 'been', 'given', 'life', 'luxury', 'cost', 'own', 'independence', 'tired', 'taking', 'give', 'what', 'offer.Then', 'have', 'MacLaine', 'A', 'somewhat', 'innocent', 'bit', 'naive', 'woman', 'who', 'heart', 'as', 'big', 'city', 'thought', 'expectations', 'reciprocation', 'strong', 'independent', 'afraid', 'need', 'someone', 'love', 'someone', 'let', 'someone', 'give', 'her.Then', 'two', 'meet', 'Mitchum', 'last', 'something', 'offer', 'someone', 'giving', 'what', 'taking', 'care', 'someone', 'else', 'instead', 'being', 'taken', 'care', 'MacLaine', 'finally', 'someone', 'unravel', 'walls', 'independence', 'need', 'someone', 'beautiful', 'relationship', 'really', 'out', 'me.Not', 'only', 'Mitchum', 'MacLaine', 'are', 'magnificent', 'love', 'fact', 'was', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'Color', 'would', 'only', 'distract', 'add', 'unnecessary', 'noise', 'message', 'movie', 'viewer', 'So', 'do', 'two', 'live', 'happy', 'ever', 'Watch', 'find', 'out', 'o']",Two for the Seesaw VHS
