Many would relate to this movie since it takes place in the Hood and this movie reminds me of the good times i had with my friends. The movie was well directed and the actors were great especially Nestor Serrano who delivered a good performance as Vinny and the great John Leguizamo who also did a great performance as Johnny, Doug E. Doug had me laughing has well and Mario Joyner also did a Great job. I also enjoyed the drama in the movie, which makes it more realistic and more worth watching. If you want a good comedy-drama movie than don't hestiate and buy this movie I will guarantee you'll love it.",5,Classic Comedy,1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,750,"['Movie', 'great', 'never', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watching', 'who', 'want', 'good', 'comedy', 'Hanging', 'Homeboys', 'movie', 'Many', 'would', 'relate', 'movie', 'place', 'Hood', 'movie', 'good', 'times', 'i', 'had', 'friends', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'directed', 'actors', 'were', 'great', 'especially', 'Nestor', 'Serrano', 'who', 'delivered', 'good', 'performance', 'Vinny', 'great', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'performance', 'Johnny', 'Doug', 'E.', 'Doug', 'had', 'laughing', 'well', 'Mario', 'Joyner', 'also', 'did', 'Great', 'job', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'drama', 'movie', 'more', 'realistic', 'more', 'worth', 'watching', 'want', 'good', 'comedy-drama', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'hestiate', 'buy', 'movie', 'will', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'love']",N/A

308106,A3AYDEWU1EPF15,6302328098,Luis Hernandez,"[0, 0]","An excellent coming to age comedy with a bit of drama, &quot;Hangin With the Homeboys&quot; chronicles a night in the life of four friends in the  Bronx as they discover that people are often different from what they  appear like.Featuring the talents of John Leguizamo (&quot;To Wong Foo,  Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar&quot;), Doug E. Doug (&quot;Cool  Runnings&quot;), Mario Joyner (&quot;The Chris Rock Show&quot;) and Nestor  Serrano, the film provided the audience with four fresh characters and  places them in a series of occurrences that make them realize how different  they real are from one another. From Fernando's (Serrano) scam of  impersonating an Italian in order to attract girls (he is Puerto Rican) to  the final scene beneath the Metro North bridge in Manhattan, the  character's all accept change at the end. The most memorable part of this  film has to be when John Leguizamo discovers that the girl he is in love  with is a totally different person, which makes him accept reality and  inspires him to find a way out of the social state he currently is  in.The film is an excellent tribute to anyone who has grown up in New  York City. Director Joseph Vasquez did an excellent job of writing and  producing this small-budget film. Sadly, Vasquez, who at the time was using  heroin, died from complications of AIDS a few years after the film's  release. The film serves as a wonderful legacy for a genius that gave the  world an excellent story with touches of humanism sprinkled throughout.If you liked &quot;American Graffiti&quot; then give this film a chance.  I also recommend &quot;I Like It Like That&quot; to anyone in a mood of  seeing films in the Bronx.",5,An Excellent Coming of Age Comedy,965779200,"08 9, 2000",2000,1693,"['excellent', 'coming', 'age', 'comedy', 'bit', 'drama', 'quot', 'Hangin', 'Homeboys', 'quot', 'night', 'life', 'four', 'friends', 'Bronx', 'discover', 'people', 'are', 'often', 'different', 'what', 'appear', 'like.Featuring', 'talents', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'quot', 'Wong', 'Foo', 'Thanks', 'Everything', 'Julie', 'Newmar', 'quot', 'Doug', 'E.', 'Doug', 'quot', 'Cool', 'Runnings', 'quot', 'Mario', 'Joyner', 'quot', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Show', 'quot', 'Nestor', 'Serrano', 'film', 'provided', 'audience', 'four', 'fresh', 'characters', 'places', 'series', 'occurrences', 'make', 'realize', 'how', 'different', 'real', 'are', 'one', 'Fernando', 'Serrano', 'scam', 'impersonating', 'Italian', 'order', 'attract', 'girls', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'final', 'scene', 'Metro', 'North', 'bridge', 'Manhattan', 'character', 'accept', 'change', 'end', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'film', 'be', 'when', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'girl', 'love', 'totally', 'different', 'person', 'accept', 'reality', 'find', 'way', 'social', 'state', 'currently', 'in.The', 'film', 'excellent', 'tribute', 'anyone', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Director', 'Joseph', 'Vasquez', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'writing', 'producing', 'small-budget', 'film', 'Sadly', 'Vasquez', 'who', 'time', 'was', 'using', 'heroin', 'died', 'complications', 'AIDS', 'few', 'years', 'film', 'release', 'film', 'wonderful', 'legacy', 'genius', 'gave', 'world', 'excellent', 'story', 'touches', 'humanism', 'sprinkled', 'throughout.If', 'liked', 'quot', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'quot', 'then', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'also', 'recommend', 'quot', 'quot', 'anyone', 'mood', 'seeing', 'films', 'Bronx']",N/A

The 4 characters are funny, watch each others back and have a good time without having to hurt anybody. Their adventures crashing the party, getting arrested and dancing at the club are funny. I enjoyed the positive aspects of the film like whether to go to college or not, just be yourself instead of someone you're not and not to judge people on appearance alone. My favorite character was Vinny/Fernando and his mannerisms when dealing with others. The funniest bits were the ugly girlfriend contest and dropping the quarter at the x-rated booth. I highly recommend this film. It is nice to see a movie where the minorities are not treated like thieves and thugs.

308108,A1ASP2IZ6WG84U,6302328098,"RJ ""starchild_101""","[0, 0]","For anyone who's ever had a Friday night out with the boys, this movie is for you.Let's start with the cast.  The director, Joseph B. Vasquez, certainly had an eye for talent. John Leguizamo, Doug E. Doug, Nestor Serrano, and Mario Joyner are the cast.  Even if you don't know all their names, you know their faces.  For many of them this was the beginning of their careers.  Similar to the way that THE OUTSIDERS helped launch the careers of Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, etc. but on a lesser scale, of course.The movie takes place on a Friday night with four very different friends hanging out in the Bronx.  There's Johnny, who's not sure whether or not to go to college, Vinnie, a Puerto Rican who thinks he's Italian and lives off various women, Tom, an aspiring actor, and Willie, who gets by on welfare.They couldn't be any more diffeent and it is thier differences and the way they approach similar situations that makes this movie so funny.  There's really no ""real"" plot it's just the guys hanging out and in the process learning about each other and themselves.It is funny with some mildly serious undertones.  Not too many people I know have seen it but when i show it to them they do enjoy it.  Sadly, the director died of AIDS shortly after the movie's release due to his heroin use.  It looked like he could have been a major force in cinema but his mental health and drug use put an end to that.",4,A small film classic,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,1409,"['anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'Friday', 'night', 'out', 'boys', 'movie', 'you.Let', 'start', 'cast', 'director', 'Joseph', 'B.', 'Vasquez', 'certainly', 'had', 'eye', 'talent', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Doug', 'E.', 'Doug', 'Nestor', 'Serrano', 'Mario', 'Joyner', 'are', 'cast', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'names', 'know', 'many', 'was', 'beginning', 'careers', 'Similar', 'way', 'THE', 'OUTSIDERS', 'helped', 'launch', 'careers', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'etc', 'lesser', 'scale', 'course.The', 'movie', 'place', 'Friday', 'night', 'four', 'very', 'different', 'friends', 'hanging', 'out', 'Bronx', 'Johnny', 'who', 'not', 'sure', 'not', 'go', 'college', 'Vinnie', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'who', 'Italian', 'off', 'various', 'women', 'Tom', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'Willie', 'who', 'welfare.They', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'diffeent', 'thier', 'differences', 'way', 'approach', 'similar', 'situations', 'movie', 'so', 'funny', 'really', 'real', 'plot', 'just', 'guys', 'hanging', 'out', 'process', 'learning', 'other', 'themselves.It', 'funny', 'mildly', 'serious', 'undertones', 'Not', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'have', 'seen', 'when', 'i', 'show', 'do', 'enjoy', 'Sadly', 'director', 'died', 'AIDS', 'shortly', 'movie', 'release', 'due', 'heroin', 'use', 'looked', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'force', 'cinema', 'mental', 'health', 'drug', 'use', 'put', 'end']",N/A
308109,A1C7QKP8PU0XS8,6302328098,yosunnyjoe,"[5, 5]","This coming of age movie was overshadowed by Boys in the Hood as they were  both released the same weekend. This movie unlike Boys in the Hood or New  Jack City despite it's title is not about gang violence. Four guys from the  same Bronx neighorhood spend a full friday night together.  Each but two of  them are growing away from this weekly ritual and the two that aren't are  not really friends. Hilarious Drama involving quick witted humor and  comical situations that come one after another. Joseph B.Vasquez who  unfortuntely past away after directing this movie obviously crammed years  of one liners and situations into 12 hours. Hilarious opening scenes and  the memorable Nestor Seranno who plays a Puerto Rican American, Fernando  who wants to be known as Vinny tells a girlfriend,&quot;Thanks for the  food. That's so nice I wish everyody was this nice to me.&quot; As he opens  his refrigerator door only to cram the dish in with the other dishes of  food made by other women. Doug E Doug who blames his bad fortune on being  black, even to black people. The troubled, sexually unexperienced and very  shy John Leguizamo who only really connects with one of the guys. Comic  Mario Joyner well acts his role as the corny but seemingly cool actor  wannabe selling magazines. This bunch goes out and hits on unsuspecting  women, Crashes a Party and has a big adventure. It's a night of big ups and  downs which ends with a message and a big laugh. The only problem with this  movie is it's mediocre editing which has minor negative effect. This is  truly one of the funniest films available. The comedy is so good you know  that these events are based on a true story.
