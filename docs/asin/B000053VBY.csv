566012,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,B000053VBY,Beau Yarbrough,"[1, 5]","""Cadence"" is not another Vietnam-era movie, although it was lumped in with them at the time it was (briefly) in theaters.The set-up -- a white soldier is convicted and placed in with a black prisoner population in the opening days of the Vietnam War in the mid-1960s -- is new and has the potential to tell a genuinely interesting story, and a strong cast seems to underscore that this is going to be a film worth watching. But the film never rises above TV movie of the week quality, with single note personalities substituting for well-rounded characters, quick set pieces passing for character development, and a denouement that puts a Band-Aid on the problems the characters in the movie all have.Why Martin Sheen got involved in this film I can understand -- his son Charlie was starring in it, and he wanted to do a project with him. But what on earth did they tell Lawrence Fishburne? This film squanders his talent, along with the talents of the actors playing the other convicted soldiers.The film repeatedly makes moves towards being something better, with segments that surely must have had good intentions behind them in the writing stage. But whether they never made it into the script, or the director or studio saw fit to remove them, we're left instead with half a movie, one in which the issues of racism, the criminal system, family and military society are approached, but never discussed and certainly no point of view ever makes it across.If, instead, we had humor, action or pathos, we could at least be distracted by that, but ultimately, all we get is Martin Sheen getting drunk and trying to climb a fence in his underwear. Whatever the merits of the scene, it's certainly no substitute for a script truly worth of Sheen, Sheen and Fishburne....",2,Movie of the week quality,975888000,"12 4, 2000",2000,1770,"['Cadence', 'not', 'Vietnam-era', 'movie', 'was', 'lumped', 'time', 'was', 'briefly', 'theaters.The', 'set-up', 'white', 'soldier', 'convicted', 'placed', 'black', 'prisoner', 'population', 'opening', 'days', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'mid-1960s', 'new', 'potential', 'tell', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'story', 'strong', 'cast', 'underscore', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'film', 'never', 'above', 'TV', 'movie', 'week', 'quality', 'single', 'note', 'personalities', 'substituting', 'well-rounded', 'characters', 'quick', 'set', 'pieces', 'passing', 'character', 'development', 'denouement', 'Band-Aid', 'problems', 'characters', 'movie', 'have.Why', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'got', 'involved', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'son', 'Charlie', 'was', 'starring', 'wanted', 'do', 'project', 'what', 'earth', 'did', 'tell', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'film', 'talent', 'talents', 'actors', 'playing', 'other', 'convicted', 'soldiers.The', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'moves', 'towards', 'being', 'something', 'better', 'segments', 'surely', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'intentions', 'writing', 'stage', 'never', 'made', 'script', 'director', 'studio', 'saw', 'fit', 'remove', ""'re"", 'left', 'instead', 'movie', 'one', 'issues', 'racism', 'criminal', 'system', 'family', 'military', 'society', 'are', 'approached', 'never', 'discussed', 'certainly', 'point', 'view', 'ever', 'across.If', 'instead', 'had', 'humor', 'action', 'pathos', 'could', 'least', 'be', 'distracted', 'ultimately', 'get', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'getting', 'drunk', 'trying', 'climb', 'fence', 'underwear', 'merits', 'scene', 'certainly', 'substitute', 'script', 'truly', 'worth', 'Sheen', 'Sheen', 'Fishburne']",N/A

As an extension, it's a war of leadership and ideals; where prejudice cannot obstruct truth, and disharmony can atrophy the fellowship of camaraderie and the strength of solidarity.STORY:  Young Private Bean (C. Sheen) gets tattoos on his hands, beats an MP, and gets sent to a military stockade under the command of Master Sergeant Otis McKinney (M. Sheen).  What Bean finds is that he's not initially welcome amongst his fellow inmates, all black, one of whom is Stokes (Fishburne), but he's also leery about McKinney.  He must eventually choose a side, and just like every other black-white movie in existence, learn a dance step from a black person.PATRIOTISM:  True patriotism is having the courage and fortitude to challenge unlawful orders, to stand up in the face of dangerously negligent leadership and defend what is just.  To be a patriot is to proud of one's country, and it's impossible to display that pride without believing in and standing up for the ideals that makes a country great.  Foreign AND domestic.FAVORITE BATTLE(S): Any movie in which Charlie Sheen takes a beating is a good one in my book.  In this one, Private Bean gets into a scuffle with a fellow inmate, Webb, who has a penchant for kleptomania.  Unfortunate for Bean, Private WebbFAVORITE LINE:  That's the sound of the man, working on the chain, ga-e-ang.THE MESSAGE:  Much like the Army's former slogan, ""Army of One,"" Cadence is about unity and solidarity.  It's about bonding with fellow soldiers regardless of difference, and to some extent, that's what calling cadence and marching in formation is all about.Great movie.  Highly entertaining.  The scenes where the prisoners are marching and singing cadence will be stuck in your head well after viewing.  Do yourself a favor and look up ""Chain Gang from Cadence"" on YouTube.

It is a terrific coming of age story involving tragedy, team work, and the tough choices morality can make a person face.The story is excellent (I could write a lot more, but I try not to give to much away).  The main character is Franklin Bean, an Army Private.  Pvt. Bean is sentenced to 90 days in the stockade after hearing the news that his father died, getting unauthorized tattoos, going on a drinking binge and hitting an MP.  In the stockade, Pvt. Bean's (who is white) ""roommates"" are 5 black prisoners.  Pvt. Bean does not fit in, not because of his fellow prison mates, but because he does not want to belong.  The stockade is overseen by Sgt. Otis McKinney, a racist disciplinarian who is constantly trying to get Bean on ""his team"".  Despite Bean's desire to be alone, Bean does pick a side.  The film ends in tragedy, and Pvt. Bean is faced with the gut wrenching decision between what is right and what is right.  While the scene I am referring to is short, I think it was one of the most powerful movie scenes showing a young person trying to make a decision where both alternatives seem to be the right thing to do, and the path he chooses has drastically different outcomes.I never even heard of this movie in the theaters.  However, I feel this is one of the greatest ""coming of age"" stories I have ever seen.  I think this is one of the best ""unknown"" movies I have ever seen.  The screenplay writing is absolutely brilliant, though I will admit I had to watch the movie a couple of times before I saw the movie as more than a story about some guy in a military prison.This is definitely not a happy movie.  I don't think this is the type of movie I pop in the DVD player and cuddle with a date on the couch.  I would classify the movie as a sad drama.
