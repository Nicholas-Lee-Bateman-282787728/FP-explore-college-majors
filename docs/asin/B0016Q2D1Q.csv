My mother was familiar with singer Jill Scott's appearances on the Oprah show, so she was thrilled to see she could act. What carries this series is the cast, tremendous actors from the hairdresser to the auto mechanic, as well as the secretary who is also a junior detective in her own right. Great fun, and a wonderful exploration of a little-known country. Alexander McCall Smith's childhood lends him a unique voice, and I am glad to see his mild stories brought to explosive life on-screen.",5,Tremendous realization of the novels,1288051200,"10 26, 2010",2010,631,"['Just', 'quick', 'note', 'anyone', 'following', 'reviews', 'bought', 'series', 'mother', 'enjoyed', 'sitting', 'down', 'watch', 'mother', 'was', 'familiar', 'singer', 'Jill', 'Scott', 'appearances', 'Oprah', 'show', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'could', 'act', 'What', 'series', 'cast', 'tremendous', 'actors', 'hairdresser', 'auto', 'mechanic', 'as', 'well', 'secretary', 'who', 'also', 'junior', 'detective', 'own', 'right', 'Great', 'fun', 'wonderful', 'exploration', 'little-known', 'country', 'Alexander', 'McCall', 'Smith', 'childhood', 'unique', 'voice', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'mild', 'stories', 'brought', 'explosive', 'life', 'on-screen']",The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency: Season 1

1154757,A2SW560X584UEF,B0016Q2D1Q,Barbara B.,"[6, 6]","As a big fan of the book series, I was somewhat reluctant to watch this series. Too often, good books don't translate into film -- particularly into television series! But despite my trepidation, I bought season one and I have to tell you -- IT IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY.No, it's NOT a literal transcription of the books but it does remain fairly true to the plotlines and ""spirit"" of the original books. None of the minor changes hurts the story and a few of the changes -- like new characters -- actually add to it.When critiquing books and shows, one of my criteria is whether or not I like the characters. After all, I'll be spending several hours (at least) with them. I wouldn't spend time with a loud, nasty or vulgar neighbor so why would I spend time with characters I don't like? Based on this one criterion, this show is a real winner. I liked ALL of the ""regulars"" -- Precious, and Grace and JLB, and BK -- and would gladly have dinner with any of them!I can't possibly list everything I liked about the series, but I will point out a few highlights:CASTING -- is perfection itself. I was worried that they would make Precious less of a ""traditionally built"" woman to fit the common TV star mold (young, thin and vapid) but Jill Scott is a true beautiful fatty (not as fatty as I am, but she can be forgiven that one flaw). She's a bit younger than I thought she was  in the books (I seem to remember reading that Mma was in her late 30s or early 40s?) but Scott's depiction is so true to character that it didn't bother me in the least. The other main characters are equally ideally cast with particularly kudos to the actors who play JLB Matakone and Mma Makutsi. Absolute gems one and all!WRITING -- the writing is funny but never slapstick, poignant without being maudlin, and always very natural -- the way people speak, not the way writers write.CINEMATOGRAPHY -- short of going to Botswana, I can't think of a better way to view this sometimes stark but always intriguing country. The shots are as good as you'll see in any first rate movie and almost never see in television series.In short, I simply adore this show. It's the best thing I've watched in years (decades?) and I hope it goes on and on and on and on...",5,Absolutely perfect in every way!,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,2234,"['big', 'fan', 'book', 'series', 'was', 'somewhat', 'reluctant', 'watch', 'series', 'Too', 'often', 'good', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'translate', 'film', 'particularly', 'television', 'series', 'trepidation', 'bought', 'season', 'one', 'have', 'tell', 'IT', 'IS', 'PERFECT', 'IN', 'EVERY', 'WAY.No', 'NOT', 'literal', 'transcription', 'books', 'remain', 'fairly', 'true', 'plotlines', 'spirit', 'original', 'books', 'None', 'minor', 'changes', 'story', 'few', 'changes', 'new', 'characters', 'actually', 'add', 'it.When', 'critiquing', 'books', 'shows', 'one', 'criteria', 'not', 'like', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'be', 'spending', 'several', 'hours', 'least', 'would', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'loud', 'nasty', 'vulgar', 'neighbor', 'so', 'why', 'would', 'spend', 'time', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Based', 'one', 'criterion', 'show', 'real', 'winner', 'liked', 'ALL', 'regulars', 'Precious', 'Grace', 'JLB', 'BK', 'would', 'gladly', 'have', 'dinner', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'list', 'everything', 'liked', 'series', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'few', 'highlights', 'CASTING', 'perfection', 'was', 'worried', 'would', 'make', 'Precious', 'less', 'traditionally', 'built', 'woman', 'fit', 'common', 'TV', 'star', 'mold', 'young', 'thin', 'vapid', 'Jill', 'Scott', 'true', 'beautiful', 'fatty', 'not', 'as', 'fatty', 'am', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'one', 'flaw', 'bit', 'younger', 'thought', 'was', 'books', 'seem', 'remember', 'reading', 'Mma', 'was', 'late', '30s', 'early', '40s', 'Scott', 'depiction', 'so', 'true', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'least', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'equally', 'ideally', 'cast', 'particularly', 'kudos', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'JLB', 'Matakone', 'Mma', 'Makutsi', 'Absolute', 'one', 'WRITING', 'writing', 'funny', 'never', 'slapstick', 'poignant', 'being', 'maudlin', 'always', 'very', 'natural', 'way', 'people', 'speak', 'not', 'way', 'writers', 'write.CINEMATOGRAPHY', 'short', 'going', 'Botswana', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'way', 'view', 'stark', 'always', 'intriguing', 'country', 'shots', 'are', 'as', 'good', ""'ll"", 'see', 'first', 'rate', 'movie', 'almost', 'never', 'see', 'television', 'series.In', 'short', 'simply', 'adore', 'show', 'best', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'years', 'decades', 'hope']",The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency: Season 1

They aren't anything that I would have chosen on my own, I know nothing about and have never been even remotely interested in Botswana, but once I started reading, I couldn't stop! I had to have every single one of them and finished them at a rate of one per day.If I had turned on this video or seen a promo for it on TV, I would have passed on it. It takes time to ""warm up"" to the personalities and their surroundings, even though the actors are superb!I had bought the video thinking I wouldn't like the books and watching it would be better (and faster). I could then tell my friend who sent me the books that I had enjoyed the series, but not tell her that I didn't read them all. It didn't work out that way. I LOVED reading the books!So far I've only watched the first episode on the video. The problem is, I had only read 3 or 4 of the books at the time I got the video, and most of the images on the screen were much different from what I had visualized in my head while I was reading. I wanted to get the books solidly in my head first before seeing an interpretation of it from someone else.I did watch enough to know that some of video series was spot on and a few things were even better than I had ""seen"" in my mind. I stopped watching because I had ordered the rest of the series in book form and wanted to enjoy those before I ""ruined"" them by watching what someone else had visualized. Now I have given it a couple of weeks and I am ready to see another interpretation or version of these great books that I never thought I would want to read.

The original price was too steep for me and when I bought it at a discounted rate it still felt a little pricey.  Then I watched the first episode. Wow! Worth every penny. Well written, well acted, beautifully appropriate wardrobes, breath-taking scenery.  Unbelievable!!!  Just the opportunity to see some of African life is worth the price.  As the series moves along you find out a little more about what makes each character tick.  Precious (Jill Scott)- a woman who had a close relationship with her father. A good man. Her relationship with Note, her talented, abusive ex-husband. Her blossoming relationship with LJB, owner of a automobile mechanics shop. Her growing friendship with her sometimes strange, but complicated secretary Grace (played wonderfully quirky by Anika Noni Rose)and of course we can't forget BK, the very wise and observant hair dresser.

As might be expected, I was both pleased and disappointed. The disappointments stemmed from the departures from Smith's books. Usually, when books are adapted for screen certain changes must be made in order to adjust to a visual medium. However, the changes which were made to Smith's books were not only unnecessary, they detracted from both the overall spirit as well as the intent of Smith's series.The addition of a new character--the hairdresser--was particularly distracting. He was out of keeping with the original stories, and contributed nothing to the plots. I got the feeling that the hairdresser was a means of ""updating"" the series.  However, the stories really don't need modernizing. Part of their appeal is that they reflect old-fashioned values--honesty, integrity and national pride. The rather lengthy exposition of Precious Ramotswe's back story was also problematic. It slowed the pace, and added material that was inconsequential. (Smith handled the revelation of Mma Ramotswe's past in the best manner possible--as the stories unfolded--and the screenplay should have stuck with that.) But the biggest problem with the adaptation was the virtual elimination of Smith's gentle ironic humor. In the absence of irony, the screenplay was forced to become more melodramatic than was originally intended. The focus on ""solving mysteries "" and catching ""bad guys"" (who were much ""badder"" than their original counterparts) not only added an element of cliche, but diminished the charm of Mma Ramotswe's encounters.On the positive side, the acting was generally very good. Some of the characters really came to life, especially J.L.B. Matekoni and Grace Makutsi. Lucien Msamati did a wonderful job as the shy mechanic, conveying an unusual depth of emotion and sensitivity. Anika Noni Rose also did a superb job as Mma Ramotswe's secretary, Miss 97%. Her timing and comic sense puts her at the top of her class as a comedienne (at least 97%). The only real disappointment among the actors was Jill Scott, who did not have sufficient heft (in spite of being traditionally built) to pull off Precious Ramotswe's strength of character, wisdom and unassailable dignity.The best part of this series, for me, was the opportunity to see and hear Botswana. I was reminded that not only was Africa the birthplace of humanity, but of music and dance as well. To witness the joyous spirit of Africa was a real treat, and not one that I will soon forget.",4,"An uneven rendition of a marvelous series, saved by some very good acting",1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,2597,"['No', '1', 'Ladies', 'Detective', 'Agency', 'books', 'are', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'So', 'naturally', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'filmed', 'version', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'was', 'pleased', 'disappointed', 'disappointments', 'stemmed', 'departures', 'Smith', 'books', 'Usually', 'when', 'books', 'are', 'adapted', 'screen', 'certain', 'changes', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'order', 'adjust', 'visual', 'medium', 'However', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'Smith', 'books', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'unnecessary', 'detracted', 'overall', 'spirit', 'as', 'well', 'intent', 'Smith', 'series.The', 'addition', 'new', 'character', 'hairdresser', 'was', 'particularly', 'distracting', 'was', 'keeping', 'original', 'stories', 'contributed', 'nothing', 'plots', 'got', 'feeling', 'hairdresser', 'was', 'means', 'updating', 'series', 'However', 'stories', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'modernizing', 'Part', 'appeal', 'reflect', 'old-fashioned', 'values', 'honesty', 'integrity', 'national', 'pride', 'rather', 'lengthy', 'exposition', 'Precious', 'Ramotswe', 'back', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'problematic', 'slowed', 'pace', 'added', 'material', 'was', 'inconsequential', 'Smith', 'handled', 'revelation', 'Mma', 'Ramotswe', 'past', 'best', 'manner', 'possible', 'stories', 'unfolded', 'screenplay', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'biggest', 'problem', 'adaptation', 'was', 'virtual', 'elimination', 'Smith', 'gentle', 'ironic', 'humor', 'absence', 'irony', 'screenplay', 'was', 'forced', 'become', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'focus', 'solving', 'mysteries', 'catching', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'were', 'much', 'badder', 'original', 'counterparts', 'not', 'only', 'added', 'element', 'cliche', 'diminished', 'charm', 'Mma', 'Ramotswe', 'encounters.On', 'positive', 'side', 'acting', 'was', 'generally', 'very', 'good', 'characters', 'really', 'came', 'life', 'especially', 'J.L.B', 'Matekoni', 'Grace', 'Makutsi', 'Lucien', 'Msamati', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'shy', 'mechanic', 'conveying', 'unusual', 'depth', 'emotion', 'sensitivity', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'also', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'Mma', 'Ramotswe', 'secretary', 'Miss', '97', '%', 'timing', 'comic', 'sense', 'top', 'class', 'comedienne', 'least', '97', '%', 'only', 'real', 'disappointment', 'actors', 'was', 'Jill', 'Scott', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'sufficient', 'heft', 'spite', 'being', 'traditionally', 'built', 'pull', 'off', 'Precious', 'Ramotswe', 'strength', 'character', 'wisdom', 'unassailable', 'dignity.The', 'best', 'part', 'series', 'was', 'opportunity', 'see', 'hear', 'Botswana', 'was', 'reminded', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'Africa', 'birthplace', 'humanity', 'music', 'dance', 'as', 'well', 'witness', 'joyous', 'spirit', 'Africa', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'soon', 'forget']",The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency: Season 1

1154779,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B0016Q2D1Q,Happy Reader,"[6, 6]","When I first started reading the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books, it took me a while to slow down to their gentle pace. Once I did, though, I thoroughly enjoyed the books and the world they took me to. It's not that bad things don't happen, it's that the way of dealing with the slings and arrows is calmer, or certainly the pace is more measured.This BBC/HBO collaberation series is the same. At first I was thinking, hmmm, this is a little slow. But then, as I kept watching it, I realized that it isn't really slow, it is calm. Your office is ransacked - the way to deal with it isn't to run around accusing people. You observe and you wait. It's actually pretty Sherlock Holmes-y in that way.The acting is excellent. The scripts are intelligent. The humor is great. When Precious Ramotswe hires a secretary, the efficient and prickly Grace Makutsi, she also needs a typewriter for said secretary. The resourceful JLB Matekoni brings in two manual typewriters. Each one has keys that don't work, but they are different keys. Later, the determined Grace explains how she can word her reports to get around the missing keys. And then we see her typing a report on one machine, taking the paper out and inserting it into the second machine, and resume typing, using only words the 2nd machine can type without misses. It takes longer to explain than it does to watch and appreciate.The ""mysteries"" Precious solves are varied and interesting. No bodies, which is true of the books, too. But just because there aren't bodies in these mysteries, doesn't mean they don't need solving.The feel of the series is very similar to ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" films, and that's not surprising, as ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" are supposed to take place in Botswana, also. However, the films were mainly filmed in South Africa, while ""The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency"" was actually filmed in Botswana.In this DVD set, you get the feature-length pilot (109 minutes), originally aired in the U.S. in 2009, and six one-hour epiosodes. The quality of the series is a reflection of the people who created it. For example, Anthony Minghella (1996 Oscar for Best Director of ""The English Patient"") directed and co-produced the pilot. Minghella said this about filming in Botswana: ""Particularly fascinating to me was working and filming in an African country where old and new are currently coexisting, where traditional values have not yet been eroded by the demands and efficiencies and neuroses of the modern. It was a privilege to be working on a film which celebrates what we can learn from Africa, and not what we think we can teach it.""Unfortunately, the U.S. ratings were poor, and HBO did not renew the series for a 2nd season.

Jill Scott puts in a masterful performance as Precious Ramotswe.  Her acting is exceptional, especially when you consider that her formal training is minimal, and she started late in life.  I've met people from that part of the world (the story is set in Botswana), and her accent is dead-on.Precious' wealthy father dies, and rather than raise his large herd of cattle, she sells them and starts a detective agency, since all her life people have told her that she would make a good detective.  Rather than moving to the city to start a ""proper"" business, Precious rents the vacant half of a building in her township, becoming neighbors with an iffeminate homosexual hairdresser whose clients are all the snotty, skinny, rich girls in town.  Precious, who is anything but skinny, often receives derisive looks.When she decides she needs a secretary, Precious hires Grace Makutsi, a nerdy waif who finished first in her class at secretarial school but can't get a job because businessmen only hire sexy secretaries, regardless of their skills.  Grace eventually becomes a partner in the agency.As opposed to most modern-day detective shows, No. 1 Ladies takes a more basic, non-technological approach to crime-solving, somewhere between Encyclopedia Brown and Columbo.  Solving cases involving a cheating wife, a missing husband, a mysterious shoe thief, and a cursed hospital bed, Precious and Grace become inseparable friends.  As the show progresses, the two find real danger, however, including a criminal organization, a rival big-city detective, and Precious' violent ex-husband.With unrivaled charm, the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency brings back old-school criminal investigation in an era of high-tech forensics.

Americans with excellent dialect and movement coaches.You really DO want to watch the additional material about the making of these episodes and meet the people behind this film.I have read (actually listened) the (audio) books. Which, in the case of these stories is even better than reading them. (Lisette Lecat, the reader, does a wonderful job with the Botsawanan words. Lovely to hear. http://www.amazon.com/The-No-Ladies-Detective-Agency/dp/1402545355/mywishlistA )I absolutely loved these videos.Stories with gentleness, forgiving and understanding - along with a bit of mystery, daring, boldness and determination.This is the only season.
