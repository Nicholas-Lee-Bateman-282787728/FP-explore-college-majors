884023,AP38PUPMRNMCW,B0007NMHOM,consolation,"[0, 0]",I remembered a scene from this movie when I saw it at the age of 7. Found it scary at the time and had a few nightmares. Funny how some things just remain with you. Decided I wanted to watch it again. In light of today's Hollywood technilogical movie marvels it was really cheesy but I do love to remanice.

884024,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0007NMHOM,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[20, 23]","While thinking about how to write this review without giving away any crucial information, I saw in the product description on Amazon they did just that, give away a whole gob of important plot points...oh well...I guess that lets me off the hook...but in all fairness, the titles pretty much gives it away, so for all you kids out their in film school, be sure to attend Proper Titling 101, as it's just as important as the rest.  Clonus (1979) aka Parts: The Clonus Horror has been vilified over the years, even given the MST3k treatment but, in its defense, as a sci-fi thriller, I didn't think it was all that bad.  If you strip it down to its core, I think the concept was ahead of its time, and still relevant, topical, and interesting.  Directed by Robert S. Fiveson, the film stars Tim Donnelly (The Toolbox Murders), whose last known appearance was as `Shooter at warehouse' in an episode of the A-Team, sometime in early 1984.  Also appearing in the film is Paulette Breen (""All My Children""), Frank Ashmore (Airplane!), Dick Sargent (The Beast with a Million Eyes, Operation Petticoat), Keenan Wynn (Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb), David Hooks (V), and Peter Graves (Stalag 17, It Conquered the World).The film opens with Peter Graves at a podium, giving a typical politician speech, full of rhetorical hibbity jibbity.  We then cut to various groups of youths exercising within a compound, smartly dressed in their Addidas track wear, reminding me much of that old TV show Battle of the Network Stars, except there are no stars here unless you count Dick Sargent, aka Darrin Stephens No. 2 (the unfunny one), from the show `Bewitched' (and I don't, by the way).  The young adults, who all have ear tags and appear to be in a state of mental arrested development, seem to always be training, constantly being monitored by Dr. Jameson (Sargent) and his group of scientists, technicians, and guides (guards).  We soon focus on one young man named George (Ashmore) and learn of his impending departure for America (the ultimate reward, or so they're led to believe...snicker...).  He has a going away party with his friends, and then is taken to a large, unassuming building within the complex to be `prepared', which essentially means getting drugged, bagged, tagged, and eventually sealed (for freshness?) in a giant Ziploc baggie.  Not much later after that one of George's friends Richard (Donnelly) starts asking questions of the metaphysical kind (well, metaphysical for a five year old), and this causes concern with those in charge of the complex, as most of the youths seem content to be led around like cattle.  Richard's curious nature finally reaches the point where he sneaks into an area he's not meant to be, learns things he wasn't meant to know, takes some evidence in the form of papers and a video tape, and eventually escapes through a Byzantine series of tunnels to the `outside' world (can't keep `em down on the farm forever), which looks strangely like San Bernardino or some such place (figures this story takes place in California), where he eventually finds his way, battered and wounded, into the back yard of a man named Jake (Wynn) who just happens to be a retired reporter.  What startling truth did Richard come across during his snooping?  You may think you know the answer, but then again...I could sense a good concept buried in here somewhere, but it seemed to get fouled up in the execution (funky direction and goofy acting).  The sequences leading up to a freeze dried George were pretty cool, but then the film dragged along for about a half hour as Richard begins questioning his purpose in the seemingly idealistic colony (check out the scene where he finds a Milwaukee's Best beer can in the river...I don't know what was funnier, him trying to figure out what it was, or his keepers rather lame explanation of what it was).  After that it kicked up a little as Richard is now on the outside, and we see the involvement of various characters.  I think the film would have gone a little better had they not spent so much time in the colony but more so on this latter aspect.  I did think it was pretty cool the sometimes extreme methods the colony security staff used to keep things hushed up.  There were a few flaws in the story like it seemed every inch of the colony was monitored, but they couldn't detect Richard as he was running around the facility, eventually escaping, until it was too late.  And the security equipment...it seemed to failed at just the most inconvenient moments (for the staff)...and lastly, with regards to the video tape Richard swiped which contained information that could blow the lid off the whole shebang...you know what?  Maybe it's not such a good idea to leave tapes lying around that could eventually come back and bite you in the bum...just ask Tommy and Pamela Lee...who was this tape made for, anyway?  A highly, top-secret organization making promotional tapes?  For what purpose?  Anyway, the acting isn't very good, the direction so-so, and the characters...well, they're just pretty funny, when they're not being all homersexual-like...seriously, did anyone else think that old man and young dude by the pool were a couple?  And how about George?  You can't tell me he wasn't bent...there is some exploration of the moral and ethical issues, but it's kept pretty light.  I did like the ending (along with the gory dream sequence) although some have categorized it as being of the typical late 70's, nihilistic, post-Watergate style, but it worked for me, giving the effect of the story coming full circle.Released by Mondo Macabro, the anamorphic widescreen (1.66:1) picture, transferred from the original negative and enhanced for 16 X 9 TV's, looks very sharp and impressive.  Special features include a 35 minute interview with director Fiverson along with a commentary track, theatrical trailer, still gallery, and a preview montage of other Mondo Macabro releases.  If you enjoyed such 70's sci-fi fare as Soylent Green (1973), A Boy and His Dog (1975), or Logan's Run (1976), then I think you'll like this one.Cookieman108",3,"""What must be must
