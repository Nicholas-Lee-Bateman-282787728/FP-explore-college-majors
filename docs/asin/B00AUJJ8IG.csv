1616900,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00AUJJ8IG,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","23 Minutes to Sunrise is more theatrical than cinematic. The film feels like a one act play centered around a diner. Even though the film moved slowly, there was something I liked about this film.The film took a little time to piece together, the director ran multiple character threads one after the other, and until the characters end up in the diner it was difficult to understand what was going on. The story cleared up once all four couples were now on stage, or in the diner. I liked working a little bit to figure out what was going on. About half way through the film, the dramatic reveal happens, and I wasn't disappointed.This isn't a film for everybody. It moves along at a deliberate pace, never bogging down or flying along quickly. Not a lot happens in the film, the majority of the film is in a diner. It isn't a complex mental exercise to watch, it isn't critical to watch every small detail. I was reminded of a television movie, Steambath (1973), with Bill Bixby. The film is shot entirely in a steam bath that turns out to be the waiting room for the afterlife, and the attendant determines where each person goes based on the stories they tell.The cinematography is quite good. The cameraman did an excellent job with framing and background elements to focus attention on the character speaking. The editing was paced exactly right, this film needed to move slowly. The director did some crazy things with real time, at one point there is a 23 minute deadline. This is announced with about 45 minutes to go in the film. The first 20 minutes are spread out over more than 20 minutes of real time. Oddly, the last three minutes are compressed to only one minute in real time. The voice over narration didn't work. That was a significant weak point in the film. Initially it made a lot of sense to hear Eddie's thoughts in voice over. I'm a sucker for voice over narration in a film. Things went bad when the voice over stopped. It was a jarring moment to no longer hear his thoughts, but only hear the conversations. I would have liked more or none of the voice over.The film is claustrophobic. I wanted more, or different set ups, or shots from other locations to be broader or wider. This is a character study, so in some ways the closeness is appropriate.The film is about the right length at about an hour and fifteen minutes. The film is not rated. It would likely get an R rating for strong language and violence. There is no nudity or obvious direct drug use. A couple has sex in the back room with the sex parts hidden behind clothes. There are a couple of urinal scenes. The cast is good. Everybody fit nicely except for Bob Zany playing Ted the nice boring guy who's wife seems to be taking advantage of him. He isn't old enough to really not have a cell phone, always pay cash, and never use twitter. The fact that he even knows twitter exits, blows his character.The chemistry within the couples was good. The two people fit together nicely. Ted and Rachel, the married couple, was a complete misfit and it is hard to imagine how they ever got together in the first place.I enjoyed trying to piece this film together during the first 10 minutes. It was then a challenge to figure out the deal with the beautiful young woman, Hannah, and the crusty cigarette smoking guy, Daniel. About mid film it became clear what was happening, shortly after the 23 minute challenge was made. Halfway into the challenge, the film lost its way. The climax is predictable, and comes at the right moment. This isn't a great film. It is a good one.",4,"A Good Film, Maybe Not For Everybody",1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,3559,"['23', 'Minutes', 'Sunrise', 'more', 'theatrical', 'cinematic', 'film', 'feels', 'one', 'act', 'play', 'centered', 'diner', 'Even', 'film', 'moved', 'slowly', 'was', 'something', 'liked', 'film.The', 'film', 'took', 'little', 'time', 'piece', 'together', 'director', 'ran', 'multiple', 'character', 'threads', 'one', 'other', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'diner', 'was', 'difficult', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'story', 'cleared', 'up', 'once', 'four', 'couples', 'were', 'now', 'stage', 'diner', 'liked', 'working', 'little', 'bit', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'half', 'way', 'film', 'dramatic', 'reveal', 'happens', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed.This', ""n't"", 'film', 'everybody', 'along', 'deliberate', 'pace', 'never', 'bogging', 'down', 'flying', 'along', 'quickly', 'Not', 'lot', 'film', 'majority', 'film', 'diner', ""n't"", 'complex', 'mental', 'exercise', 'watch', ""n't"", 'critical', 'watch', 'small', 'detail', 'was', 'reminded', 'television', 'movie', 'Steambath', '1973', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'film', 'shot', 'entirely', 'steam', 'bath', 'out', 'be', 'waiting', 'room', 'afterlife', 'attendant', 'determines', 'where', 'person', 'based', 'stories', 'tell.The', 'cinematography', 'quite', 'good', 'cameraman', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'framing', 'background', 'elements', 'focus', 'attention', 'character', 'speaking', 'editing', 'was', 'paced', 'exactly', 'right', 'film', 'needed', 'move', 'slowly', 'director', 'did', 'crazy', 'things', 'real', 'time', 'one', 'point', '23', 'minute', 'deadline', 'announced', 'about', '45', 'minutes', 'go', 'film', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'spread', 'out', 'more', '20', 'minutes', 'real', 'time', 'Oddly', 'last', 'three', 'minutes', 'are', 'compressed', 'only', 'one', 'minute', 'real', 'time', 'voice', 'narration', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'significant', 'weak', 'point', 'film', 'Initially', 'made', 'lot', 'sense', 'hear', 'Eddie', 'thoughts', 'voice', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'voice', 'narration', 'film', 'Things', 'went', 'bad', 'when', 'voice', 'stopped', 'was', 'jarring', 'moment', 'longer', 'hear', 'thoughts', 'only', 'hear', 'conversations', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'none', 'voice', 'over.The', 'film', 'claustrophobic', 'wanted', 'more', 'different', 'set', 'ups', 'shots', 'other', 'locations', 'be', 'broader', 'wider', 'character', 'study', 'so', 'ways', 'closeness', 'appropriate.The', 'film', 'right', 'length', 'hour', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'would', 'likely', 'get', 'R', 'rating', 'strong', 'language', 'violence', 'nudity', 'obvious', 'direct', 'drug', 'use', 'couple', 'sex', 'back', 'room', 'sex', 'parts', 'hidden', 'clothes', 'are', 'couple', 'urinal', 'scenes', 'cast', 'good', 'Everybody', 'fit', 'nicely', 'Bob', 'Zany', 'playing', 'Ted', 'nice', 'boring', 'guy', 'who', 'wife', 'be', 'taking', 'advantage', ""n't"", 'old', 'enough', 'really', 'not', 'have', 'cell', 'phone', 'always', 'pay', 'cash', 'never', 'use', 'twitter', 'fact', 'even', 'twitter', 'exits', 'character.The', 'chemistry', 'couples', 'was', 'good', 'two', 'people', 'fit', 'together', 'nicely', 'Ted', 'Rachel', 'married', 'couple', 'was', 'complete', 'misfit', 'hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'ever', 'got', 'together', 'first', 'place.I', 'enjoyed', 'trying', 'piece', 'film', 'together', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'then', 'challenge', 'figure', 'out', 'deal', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'Hannah', 'crusty', 'cigarette', 'smoking', 'guy', 'Daniel', 'mid', 'film', 'became', 'clear', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'shortly', '23', 'minute', 'challenge', 'was', 'made', 'Halfway', 'challenge', 'film', 'lost', 'way', 'climax', 'predictable', 'right', 'moment', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'good', 'one']",23 Minutes to Sunrise

1616902,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00AUJJ8IG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","On many levels, the low-budget ""23 Minutes to Sunrise"" is not a particularly good movie.  If you wanted to pick apart the screenplay's flaws and inconsistencies, it wouldn't be hard to do.  Despite this, though, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the movie actually worked.  The experience might be categorized as a thriller, or maybe even horror, but I see it as something much simpler than that.  This is an existential drama, an examination on the value of life.  As disparate souls are brought together in an all-night diner, each will have to face the essential truths of their lives.  Each must confront a personal Hell and then, in many ways, undergo the ultimate test.  They may just come face to face with the Devil himself.  Don't come to ""23 Minutes to Sunrise"" for non-stop action or scares.  If you do, your expectations will not be met.  Instead, this is a slow-burn drama with a supernatural bent.  So while not perfect, I credit the film with taking the time to unravel an actual story and for attempting to develop its characters.Truthfully. I didn't expect much from this straight-to-DVD endeavor and this probably served me well.  The move scores HUGE points as it opens with Leonard Cohen's ""Everybody Knows,"" one of my favorite songs that sets the mood perfectly.  We meet the motley bunch of characters before we get trapped in a diner together.  There is a disillusioned veteran, an emotionally abused waitress, a couple that appear to be on the wrong side of the law, an older couple struggling with apathy, a mysterious young lady, and a creepy Eric Roberts.  The veteran (Dingani Beza) is the diner's cook, and he provides the film with an ominous voice-over narration.  He is struggling with grand notions of life and death, with putting meaning and context into his existence.  His internal struggle is crucial to the night's events.  For at one booth, Roberts and the young woman (Haley Busch) are discussing many of the same themes.  You know, before the end of the night, these notions will be put to the test for everyone in Sunrise Diner.It would be easy to give away more details (as some of the others have done), but part of my pleasure in watching the movie was to see how it unfolded.  So I'm not giving away any spoilers.  The eight people are trapped, both physically and metaphorically, for the longest 23 minutes of their lives.  Seriously, at one point 20 plus minutes goes by in real time, but it represents less than seven minutes of movie time.  When the final confrontation reaches a crescendo, it all has a pleasing madness.  The movie isn't perfect, however.  The older couple is mysteriously off-screen during the pivotal face-off (and why were they there in the first place at sunrise?) and then the younger couple all but vanish when it's done, but for the most part, this satisfied me.  Perhaps not for everyone, I appreciated that ""23 Minutes to Sunrise"" had some good ambitions.  My burning question, though, is why didn't anyone eat?  3 1/2 stars, with a round up for being much better than expected.
