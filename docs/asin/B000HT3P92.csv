1016333,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000HT3P92,Dorrie Wheeler,"[4, 8]","Now available on DVD is Who Made The Potato Salad?  The film features an all star cast of African-American talent. Jaleel White, who is best known for his role as Steve Urkel on Family Matters stars as Michael.  Michael is a young police officer who is in love with his beautiful girl friend Ashley.  After he proposes, he has to meet her family.  Michael and Ashley soon meet Ashley's very boisterous and stereotypical ghetto family. Her father, portrayed by character actor Clifton Powell has a very short fuse and curses quite often.  He is upset that his daughter has brought home a ""pig"" and says he even would have preferred a gangsta rapper.  De Ray Davis (Wild N Out) stars in the film as Ashley's super hood brother. The family members curse at the drop of a hat even when young children are present. Ashley and her mother seem to be the quiet reserved ones in the family. There just seems to be a lot of unnecessary ignorance displayed in this film.There is nothing funny about Who Made The Potato Salad?  It's a sad commentary on black America and is equivalent to a modern day blaxpoitation film.  It seems that it aims to be similar to movies like Friday, which was a hilarious movie, but Who Made The Potatoe Salad? Falls far short.  It's a film about a young black man with a respectable career who is taunted and teased by his fianc&eacute;s ignorant family.The film really does include an all star cast which includes Ella Joyce, Tiny Lister, Reynaldo Rey, with a special appearance by Eddie Griffin.I'm sure there are some people out there who will find this film hilarious and will even feel like it was made about their family.

I had never heard of this movie but a family member had it on tape, so I watched it expecting it to be wack. Jaleel White as a cop did not strike me as interesting, but as soon as this dude proposed to his girlfriend and went home with her to meet the family, the nonsense began. This was some of the dumbest entertainment ever: from butts sticking to plastic couches; being pressured into eating pork; the prisoner boyfriend's talk about Tiger style, the [...] grandparents; etc. It was some of the most stupid funny ever, but I enjoyed every minute of it. My hand didn't leave my forehead and the grin never left because this movie was such a waste of time; but in a good way. I wouldn't suggest buying it, but I would suggest renting it on a day when you're off work, bored, and need something to tickle your funnybone.Cons: I don't know why this woman was picked for the role as his girlfriend. Her acting was about as plastic as the couch, and I saw no connection between the two.

Who Made the Potato salad was a valid comedic joke that I've heard alot at dinners and black gatherings!! haha i'm laughin now. I go around asking randomly ""Who Made the Potato Salad"".Anyway about the movie. It's basically Guess Who's Coming to Dinner/Guess who (newer updated version) except instead of it being a black guy or white guy (Guess who-Ashton Kutcher) it's a copper! aka 5.0 aka Pig (in the moive) aka Shaft (in the movie) aka Po-Po aka Urkel (Jaleel White). haha It's sorta he's dorky but uppity meeting the slightly ghetto family of his fiancees. The mom in Boomerang who makes the chittlins is in it. Her part stood out the most and I was on the floor laughing at her and her husband (comedian from Comic view with the red hair. He also played the dad of the guy who Debo stole the bike from in the First Friday movie)I'll have to watch it again b/c I didn't knwo it was a Thanksgiving setting.Ummm there should be jokes for everyone in this movie. I thought the first scene was hilarious. The plastic cover on the couch was funny (you can relate to that right!)Ummm there's two parts that might make it uncomfortable to watch with your folks. The cursing (yeah I agree very excessive and the n-word) and then Jaleel waking up with a morning w--d.
