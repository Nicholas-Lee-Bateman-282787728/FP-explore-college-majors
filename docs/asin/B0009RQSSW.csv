After years of buying stray episodes on VHS for outrageous prices, we can all sit back and enjoy what was arguably the greatest children's show of all time.In the long history of children's programming, there have been shows that taught language skills, shows that taught math, geography, history, whatever, but ""Fraggle Rock"" was unique in that it focused specifically on morality. The tiny Fraggles (knee-high to a human) were mirrors of ourselves. This season addresses such issues as the real meaning of slavery (""Wembley and the Gorgs""), personal identity (""The Minstrels""), the value of natural resources (""Let the Water Run""), what makes something truly priceless (""The Treasure of the Fraggles"") and, in one of my all-time favorites, the balance of ecosystems and the dangers of persuasion (""The Preachification of Convincing John"").Sound like heady stuff for kids? It was actually hilarious, sweet, and totally unforgettable. When Jim Henson died he left a void that no one has filled, a world where laughter was based not on ridicule but on goofy bizarreness, where friends were loyal and enemies usually just misunderstood, and where joy was always tinged with a touch of melancholy. ""Fraggle Rock"" (along with the little-seen ""Storyteller"") was one his most brilliant creations.Great songs, magical sets, many of the most legendary Muppet performers, and important things to say.

911291,A1Q0CZZ4CUP748,B0009RQSSW,David Stockett,"[8, 8]","What else can you say?!  It's the Fraggles!!!I watched this show back in the early '80s as part of The Muppet craze.  The first season was by far the best.  I used to like the catchy songs -- ""Dance your cares away!  Worries for another day!"" -- and the quirky characters such as the crazy old guy who was always building gadgets ""in the outside world"".I was sitting with my son one morning watching Thomas & Friends when the promo came on for Fraggle Rock Season One.  My son said, ""What's that?""  I said, ""Fraggles!""  He laughed at the cuts, and seemed more interested in the promo instead of Thomas, so I ordered the Season 1 set.Talk about a time warp!  The videography is 1980s to be sure, but the songs and episodes have an innocence that's not tied down by 21st-Century political correctness, the ""Everybody is a Winner"" crap, and ""Let's all learn to be apologists"" that is pervasive in children's videos today.Gobo and friends still make me laugh, especially when they do something stupid or dangerous -- such as jumping into the pool, or being chased by the Gorgs.  It's a fun show, and even though it's almost 30 years old, my kid loves it.  Every night since the DVDs arrived, he has asked to watch ""The Rock"".Let's face it: Jim Henson was a genius.

When I mentioned this to my sister, she said she heard that Fraggles were making a comeback with a new movie coming out. Sure enough, when I checked Amazon, the complete series was available. It was such a joy to see this again. This is a great show for kids (or nostalgic adults). The puppetry is great. The show is very musical, but the songs (by and large) aren't corny or annoying. Some of them are actually a bit tender. The episodes often deal with themes like prejudice and the environment.That being said, I'd recommend getting the newerFraggle Rock: Complete Series CollectionDVD set.

911297,A2J74AQZCTFD52,B0009RQSSW,"Jerry Edwards ""jebsdad""","[373, 377]","Fraggle Rock has been one of my favorite shows since I first saw it on the Disney Channel back in the 1980s. I have seen most of the shows over the years and have watched them numerous times on video tape. I am thrilled that the first season is finally scheduled to come out on DVD. I have enjoyed the DVD releases of the Fraggles, but I prefer to have season collections. Hopefully this first season will sell well enough for all 5 seasons and 96 episodes to be released, as well as the various Fraggle Rock specials - such as Down At Fraggle Rock.I love the fact that the stories are entertaining, but also have a good moral to each story. With the different worlds shown with different creatures, there's a world and creature for everyone - whatever their tastes. Since each episode usually contained at least 3 storylines about the different creatures, I'll concentrate on the Fraggles in my below description of the shows.The first 3 shows have appeared on DVD under the title ""Where It All Began"" and show #11 (Catch The Tail By The Tiger) on the DVD ""Live By The Rule Of The Rock"", but the other 20 shows of the first year have not appeared on DVD as far as I know.The 24 shows of season 1 are as follows:1. Beginnings (or ""The Beginning"") - the different creatures of the show are introduced, beginning with the human inventor Doc and his dog Sprocket (a Muppet-type dog) discovering a large hole in the wall of an old room Doc is converting into a workshop. Gobo (one of the main Fraggles) has the scary task of entering the workshop in order to retrieve the postcards his Uncle Matt sends as Matt explores ""Outer Space"" (the human world).2. Wembley and the Gorgs - Wembley causes trouble for himself when he agrees with everyone - especially the giant Gorgs, who decide to make Wembley their own personal loyal subject.3. Let The Water Run - The Fraggles try to get the water running again when the pool goes dry due to Doc turning off the water while he's doing repairs.4. You Can't Do That Without A Hat - Boober loses his lucky hat and loses his courage along with his hat.5. The Thirty-Minute Work Week - Wembley has trouble making up his mind what job he wants to do.6. The Preachification Of Convincing John - Mokey gets Convincing John to help her convince the other Fraggles that eating the Doozer constructions is wrong.7. I Want To Be You - Because Mokey is so popular, Red decides to be just like Mokey.8. The Terrible Tunnel - The Terrible Tunnel is just a legend ... until Wembley accidentally finds it.9. Treasure Of The Fraggles - Red and Gobo find a map to the Treasure of the Fraggles.10. Don't Cry Over Spilt Milk - Doc boards up the hole in the wall, trapping Gobo inside the workshop.11. Catch The Tail By The Tiger - Gobo, although scared to death by the idea, decides to leave Fraggle Rock to look for his Uncle Matt when Gobo hasn't received a postcard for weeks.12. The Finger Of Light - Mokey has lots of trouble being in charge when she is made Ruler of the Rock.13. We Love You, Wembley - Everywhere Wembley turns, someone wants him to do something for them - except Lou, who likes Wembley without wanting something from him.14. The Challenge - Red is tired of Gobo being the leader and challenges his leadership.15. I Don't Care - No one respects Boober's feelings and he is sick of it.16. Capture The Moon - During the Festival of the Moon, Gobo is the Moon Greeter, but Junior Gorg steals the moon!17. Marooned - No surprise to Boober ... his birthday is interrupted by a disaster!18. The Minstrels - Cantus and his wandering minstrels tells the Fraggles that everyone must find their own song, but Red is having a diffucult time finding her song.19. The Great Radish Famine - The Trash Heap makes all the radishes disappear to teach everyone a lesson.20. The Garden Plot - Fraggle Rock is being attacked from two sides - by Sprocket trying to smash his way in with a mallet and Junior Gorg trying to pulverize it from his side.21. Gobo's Discovery - Gobo loses faith in himself and decides not to be an explorer anymore.22. Mokey's Funeral - Mokey tries to deal with the Gorgs' trap by herself because everyone thinks she's no good at doing practical things.23. The Beast Of Bluerock - Wembley is afraid to go with Gobo to Bluerock.24. New Trash Heap In Town - Although the message is to think for yourselves, Mokey becomes the new Trash Heap due to a misunderstanding of the message.",5,Fraggle Rock - Something For Everyone,1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,4425,"['Fraggle', 'Rock', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'first', 'saw', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'back', '1980s', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'shows', 'years', 'have', 'watched', 'numerous', 'times', 'video', 'tape', 'am', 'thrilled', 'first', 'season', 'finally', 'scheduled', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Fraggles', 'prefer', 'have', 'season', 'collections', 'Hopefully', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'sell', 'well', 'enough', '5', 'seasons', '96', 'episodes', 'be', 'released', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'specials', 'such', 'Down', 'Fraggle', 'Rock.I', 'love', 'fact', 'stories', 'are', 'entertaining', 'also', 'have', 'good', 'moral', 'story', 'different', 'worlds', 'shown', 'different', 'creatures', 'world', 'creature', 'everyone', 'tastes', 'episode', 'usually', 'contained', 'least', '3', 'storylines', 'different', 'creatures', ""'ll"", 'concentrate', 'Fraggles', 'description', 'shows.The', 'first', '3', 'shows', 'have', 'appeared', 'DVD', 'title', 'Where', 'Began', 'show', '11', 'Catch', 'Tail', 'Tiger', 'DVD', 'Live', 'Rule', 'Rock', 'other', '20', 'shows', 'first', 'year', 'have', 'not', 'appeared', 'DVD', 'as', 'far', 'know.The', '24', 'shows', 'season', '1', 'are', 'follows:1', 'Beginnings', 'Beginning', 'different', 'creatures', 'show', 'are', 'introduced', 'beginning', 'human', 'inventor', 'Doc', 'dog', 'Sprocket', 'Muppet-type', 'dog', 'discovering', 'large', 'hole', 'wall', 'old', 'room', 'Doc', 'converting', 'workshop', 'Gobo', 'one', 'main', 'Fraggles', 'scary', 'task', 'entering', 'workshop', 'order', 'retrieve', 'postcards', 'Uncle', 'Matt', 'Matt', 'Outer', 'Space', 'human', 'world', '.2', 'Wembley', 'Gorgs', 'Wembley', 'trouble', 'when', 'everyone', 'especially', 'giant', 'Gorgs', 'who', 'decide', 'make', 'Wembley', 'own', 'personal', 'loyal', 'subject.3', 'Let', 'Water', 'Run', 'Fraggles', 'try', 'get', 'water', 'running', 'again', 'when', 'pool', 'dry', 'due', 'Doc', 'turning', 'off', 'water', 'doing', 'repairs.4', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Do', 'Hat', 'Boober', 'lucky', 'hat', 'courage', 'hat.5', 'Thirty-Minute', 'Work', 'Week', 'Wembley', 'trouble', 'making', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'job', 'do.6', 'Preachification', 'Convincing', 'John', 'Mokey', 'Convincing', 'John', 'help', 'convince', 'other', 'Fraggles', 'eating', 'Doozer', 'constructions', 'wrong.7', 'Want', 'Be', 'Mokey', 'so', 'popular', 'Red', 'be', 'just', 'Mokey.8', 'Terrible', 'Tunnel', 'Terrible', 'Tunnel', 'just', 'legend', 'Wembley', 'accidentally', 'it.9', 'Treasure', 'Fraggles', 'Red', 'Gobo', 'find', 'map', 'Treasure', 'Fraggles.10', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Over', 'Spilt', 'Milk', 'Doc', 'boards', 'up', 'hole', 'wall', 'trapping', 'Gobo', 'workshop.11', 'Catch', 'Tail', 'Tiger', 'Gobo', 'scared', 'death', 'idea', 'leave', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'look', 'Uncle', 'Matt', 'when', 'Gobo', ""n't"", 'received', 'postcard', 'weeks.12', 'Finger', 'Light', 'Mokey', 'lots', 'trouble', 'being', 'charge', 'when', 'made', 'Ruler', 'Rock.13', 'Love', 'Wembley', 'Everywhere', 'Wembley', 'turns', 'someone', 'do', 'something', 'Lou', 'who', 'Wembley', 'wanting', 'something', 'him.14', 'Challenge', 'Red', 'tired', 'Gobo', 'being', 'leader', 'leadership.15', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Care', 'one', 'Boober', 'feelings', 'sick', 'it.16', 'Capture', 'Moon', 'Festival', 'Moon', 'Gobo', 'Moon', 'Greeter', 'Junior', 'Gorg', 'moon', '17', 'Marooned', 'surprise', 'Boober', 'birthday', 'interrupted', 'disaster', '18', 'Minstrels', 'Cantus', 'wandering', 'minstrels', 'Fraggles', 'everyone', 'must', 'find', 'own', 'song', 'Red', 'having', 'diffucult', 'time', 'finding', 'song.19', 'Great', 'Radish', 'Famine', 'Trash', 'Heap', 'radishes', 'disappear', 'teach', 'everyone', 'lesson.20', 'Garden', 'Plot', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'being', 'attacked', 'two', 'sides', 'Sprocket', 'trying', 'smash', 'way', 'mallet', 'Junior', 'Gorg', 'trying', 'pulverize', 'side.21', 'Gobo', 'Discovery', 'Gobo', 'faith', 'not', 'be', 'explorer', 'anymore.22', 'Mokey', 'Funeral', 'Mokey', 'deal', 'Gorgs', 'trap', 'herself', 'everyone', 'good', 'doing', 'practical', 'things.23', 'Beast', 'Bluerock', 'Wembley', 'afraid', 'go', 'Gobo', 'Bluerock.24', 'New', 'Trash', 'Heap', 'Town', 'message', 'think', 'yourselves', 'Mokey', 'new', 'Trash', 'Heap', 'due', 'misunderstanding', 'message']",Fraggle Rock - Complete First Season

Between the two of them, my time has been pretty much occupied by those lovable creatures known to the world as Muppets.Fraggle Rock's first season consists of twenty-four episodes that deal with the issues of the five major Fraggles, Gobo, Red, Mokey, Wembley (my personal favorite), and Boober, ranging from working and chores all the way up to near-death experiences, nothing you would normally expect from a typical children's television programming. The Fraggles live day-to-day lives of singing, dancing, eating doozer sticks, stealing radishes, and asking the Trash Heap and her two guards, who look like anteaters, for usually very unhelpful advice. The songs they sing are original, catchy, and are things you probably would find me singing as I walk down the street listening to my iPod.As for special features, this set delivers just what I was asking for in my review of The Muppet Show. You get interviews with the muppeteers, as well as a walkthrough documentary showing how they do it. There is also a CD-ROM that came with the set that had desktop themes, wallpapers and screen savers. It is worth it just to see the Doozers walk on my screen building things.",4,"What The Muppet Show Didn't Have in Special Features, Fraggle Rock Did!",1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,1413,"['First', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'wow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'forgot', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'Fraggles', 'Ok', 'way.Henson/Disney', 'have', 'struck', 'gold', 'last', 'few', 'weeks', 'first', 'releasing', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'See', 'Review', 'now', 'Fraggle', 'Rock', 'two', 'time', 'been', 'pretty', 'much', 'occupied', 'lovable', 'creatures', 'known', 'world', 'Muppets.Fraggle', 'Rock', 'first', 'season', 'twenty-four', 'episodes', 'deal', 'issues', 'five', 'major', 'Fraggles', 'Gobo', 'Red', 'Mokey', 'Wembley', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Boober', 'ranging', 'working', 'chores', 'way', 'near-death', 'experiences', 'nothing', 'would', 'normally', 'expect', 'typical', 'children', 'television', 'programming', 'Fraggles', 'live', 'day-to-day', 'lives', 'singing', 'dancing', 'eating', 'doozer', 'sticks', 'stealing', 'radishes', 'asking', 'Trash', 'Heap', 'two', 'guards', 'who', 'look', 'anteaters', 'usually', 'very', 'unhelpful', 'advice', 'songs', 'sing', 'are', 'original', 'catchy', 'are', 'things', 'probably', 'would', 'find', 'singing', 'walk', 'street', 'listening', 'iPod.As', 'special', 'features', 'set', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'asking', 'review', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'get', 'interviews', 'muppeteers', 'as', 'well', 'walkthrough', 'documentary', 'showing', 'how', 'do', 'also', 'CD-ROM', 'came', 'set', 'had', 'desktop', 'themes', 'wallpapers', 'screen', 'savers', 'just', 'see', 'Doozers', 'walk', 'screen', 'building', 'things']",Fraggle Rock - Complete First Season

And personally, right now I like Fraggle Rock more than the Muppet Show, as someone else said (sorry about stealing your line.) I received 364 days ago (last Christmas) as a Christmas present. I have 3 plush Fraggles (Red, Wembley, and Gobo) and I can't wait for the movie coming out sometime in late 2008 or early 2009. You may find this hard to believe but I like it and I'm 14 years old.Now, let's talk about what makes this show fantastic. It's colorful, they make the characters so real, they have good music, I like the idea of a show taking place underground (you can only see so many above ground shows and movies) and the fact it's got puppetry and the overall sillyness.I could tell you about the episodes and 5 main characters but I'd rather let you find this out for yourself.

This show can really appeal to all ages because each episode is about universal things, not really school-related stuff...not that that's a bad thing.  The show looks like it could have been made 20 years ago OR today...it's not dated at all.  Here's the surprise: I wasn't sure I had seen it when it was on cable TV back in the early-to-mid 1980s, and I was older than its original target demographic...I was 15 in 1983, so I basically missed it...yet I recall certain bits and characters...This show is completely fresh and colourful, with fun, touching stories, AMAZING sets, anarch-ish energy, and the characters are sorta punkish and hippyish.  If you have a child, or have never lost (or wish to regain) your own inner child (like myself), you simply NEED this DVD set!!!I loved how ""Fraggle Rock"" is so intricate, but simple and understandable at the same time, and oh so interesting...I wish I was a Fraggle and lived in their world, really!!!  I love to eat radishes, swim and play music all day!!  It's neat the way the Fraggles (the main 5 are really swell characters...Gobo, Boober, Wembley, Mokey and Red, as well as Gobo's Uncle Traveling Matt and the awesome Pipe Bangers), the huge funny dopey Gords, the adorable Doozers (sort of a 1980s Bob The Builders), and the hilarious antics of the Irish inventor Doc and his sidekick dog Sprocket (another fun Muppet)...oh and can't forget the hilarious Trash Heap and her 2 ratty sidekicks, haha, with her unique brand of ""wisdom"" and advice.  I love how it's all about friendship, morality, that it shows how these ""cultures"" are interdependent, and worldly but innocent and oh so ORIGINAL!!!This show is not only nutritious, but it really can lift your spirits if you're in a bad/sad mood.I REALLY need all 5 seasons, a CD/CDs of all the Fraggle tunes...that opening theme is unbelievably great, and a shirt with the Fraggles on it...hard to pick a fave character, but I really like the hat-wearing, sensitive, eccentric hippy Boober...his voice sounds like Kermit/JIm Henson...and Mokey is really sweet too, and kinda serious.This show simply RULES...I want to introduce the Fraggles to my young nephews and niece, they will be hooked...NOW I know why this show has a fervent cult and appeal to punkrock kids of all ages...why wouldn't it???",5,"WOW!!!

The two central characters are Gobo and his uncle Matt.  Matt is an explorer and wonders out into the world of man, ""Outer Space"" for fraggles, and learns about the ways of our world.  He relays his observations back as postcards to Gobo.  Gobo in turn has his own adventures.Each episode is 1/2 hour long, and self-contained; though all the episodes stream together.

You stated that you remember watching fraggle rock on the Disney Channel in the 80s?  Uh ...don't thinkg that is true.  Disney did not purchase the rights to Jim Hensons' muppets until after he died.  In the 80s, the Disney channel did not play Jim Henson shows, because they did not have a partnership.  Jim Henson died May 1990. RIP.  I see you are a big Disney fan, but please get the facts right.
