1091621,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000TMD8ZI,Jeffery Mingo,"[2, 4]","Two stories entwine (sp?) in this film about London youth.  This film did have elements of ""Kids,"" ""Boyz N Da Hood,"" and ""Menace II Society,"" but it was still original and jaw-dropping.This film shows violent, disrespectful, evildoers, of both genders and many races.  They are unlovable characters for which it is hard to root.  I thought of the clich'e ""If you lie down with dogs"" as I watched this.  Since the characters are so nasty to their enemies and strangers, it's no surprise that they become nasty with each other.While American films can be multi-culty, study after study after study show that the US is highly segregated in schools, neighborhoods, and especially marriage.  Here you see white, Black, and Asian Brits intermingling frequently.  Not one character disapproves of interracial coupling, while in most American films, there is at least one character who would make a fuss about it.  Seeing the ethnic bonding throughout the film seemed so unlike the US.This film also shows a gray area regarding racism in the UK.  For example, Black males have trouble getting a cab, but once they do ride in one, they stiff the cabbie.  Later, the Black males are spied upon by store security.  In the same way that ""The Color Puprle"" needed Sophia's story in order to show that while Celie was a domestic violence victim, all the characters still lived in a racially-oppressive context, here these mean kids also facee structural inequalities.I kept asking myself, ""Who is the audience for this film!?""  I assume most films with young actors are attracting a young market.  However, I did wonder if the film was meant to make adult scream, ""What is this world coming to?!""  This was just another film portraying youth as a ""lost generation.""  Still, I wonder if young viewers would get a kick or laugh watching their parents and elders squirm at the destructive acts shown in this film.This was an interesting study in how groups oftentimes exacerbate the bad deeds of individual members.  The film does try to have a redemptive quality by its end.  Further, this has a great British rap soundtrack that rap fans in the US may love.  Sensitive viewers should stay away from this film, but the work is a valuable cultural product.",3,Wearing a school uniform doesn't mean leading a calm life.,1258675200,"11 20, 2009",2009,2239,"['Two', 'stories', 'entwine', 'sp', 'film', 'London', 'youth', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'elements', 'Kids', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Da', 'Hood', 'Menace', 'II', 'Society', 'was', 'still', 'original', 'jaw-dropping.This', 'film', 'shows', 'violent', 'disrespectful', 'evildoers', 'genders', 'many', 'races', 'are', 'unlovable', 'characters', 'hard', 'root', 'thought', 'clich', 'e', 'lie', 'down', 'dogs', 'watched', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'nasty', 'enemies', 'strangers', 'surprise', 'become', 'nasty', 'other.While', 'American', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'multi-culty', 'study', 'study', 'study', 'show', 'US', 'highly', 'segregated', 'schools', 'neighborhoods', 'especially', 'marriage', 'Here', 'see', 'white', 'Black', 'Asian', 'Brits', 'intermingling', 'frequently', 'Not', 'one', 'character', 'disapproves', 'interracial', 'coupling', 'most', 'American', 'films', 'least', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'fuss', 'Seeing', 'ethnic', 'bonding', 'film', 'seemed', 'so', 'US.This', 'film', 'also', 'gray', 'area', 'regarding', 'racism', 'UK', 'example', 'Black', 'males', 'have', 'trouble', 'getting', 'cab', 'once', 'do', 'ride', 'one', 'stiff', 'cabbie', 'Later', 'Black', 'males', 'are', 'spied', 'store', 'security', 'same', 'way', 'Color', 'Puprle', 'needed', 'Sophia', 'story', 'order', 'show', 'Celie', 'was', 'domestic', 'violence', 'victim', 'characters', 'still', 'lived', 'racially-oppressive', 'context', 'here', 'mean', 'kids', 'also', 'facee', 'structural', 'inequalities.I', 'kept', 'asking', 'Who', 'audience', 'film', 'assume', 'most', 'films', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'attracting', 'young', 'market', 'However', 'did', 'wonder', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'make', 'adult', 'scream', 'What', 'world', 'coming', 'was', 'just', 'film', 'portraying', 'youth', 'lost', 'generation', 'Still', 'wonder', 'young', 'viewers', 'would', 'get', 'kick', 'watching', 'parents', 'elders', 'squirm', 'destructive', 'acts', 'shown', 'film.This', 'was', 'interesting', 'study', 'how', 'groups', 'oftentimes', 'exacerbate', 'bad', 'deeds', 'individual', 'members', 'film', 'try', 'have', 'redemptive', 'quality', 'end', 'Further', 'great', 'British', 'rap', 'soundtrack', 'rap', 'fans', 'US', 'may', 'love', 'Sensitive', 'viewers', 'should', 'stay', 'away', 'film', 'work', 'valuable', 'cultural', 'product']",N/A

1091623,A3VSUJZC7D352O,B000TMD8ZI,Nate,"[1, 3]","Taking place over a time span of less than 48 hrs, Kidulthood is an in your face drama about growing up in Londons western suburbs. Focusing on the lives of 3 teenagers, the story is basically 'a day in the life' as we follow the youths and their friends around before their stories come together in a powerful and climatic ending.For Trife, our main character, violence is an everyday part of life, him and his friends regularly get into fights, and he is being lured closer into his uncle's west side gang. Living with his single mother in a small apartment, the only way out for Trife seems to be working for his uncle. But he must decide on a life of crime or to support his pregnant girlfriend.Alisa has just found out she is pregnant, her best friend has commited suicide, and her boyfriend has just dumped her. Feeling all alone in the world she often gives sexual favours in exchange for drugs, and is constantly harrassed by Sam, who may or may not be her babies father.Sam is the protagonist, he regularly bullies kids at his school and uses violence to get anything he wants including girls. It is sam who sets off the chain of events that lead to the dramatic conclusion, by threatening to kill a student by the name of katie, who was the friend of Alisa's that killed herself.UK's version of 'kids', it may not be as good, but it certainly gets its point across, shocking at times, but is a blunt assessment of todays youth and gang culture. While the acting at times isn't great, it is made up for by some great directing, you would never guess the movie was made on such a low budget. The only other negative point was the lack of sub-titles, which at times were necessary as the West London accent can be tough to understand, and this will certainly be a turn off for American audiences.Overall a very powerful drama, with a great modern soundtrack, watch it if you liked 'kids', or 'Menace II Society', and look out for the sequel 'Adulthood'.",3,Powerful in your face drama,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,1960,"['Taking', 'place', 'time', 'span', 'less', '48', 'hrs', 'Kidulthood', 'face', 'drama', 'growing', 'up', 'Londons', 'western', 'suburbs', 'Focusing', 'lives', '3', 'teenagers', 'story', 'basically', 'day', 'life', 'follow', 'youths', 'friends', 'stories', 'come', 'together', 'powerful', 'climatic', 'ending.For', 'Trife', 'main', 'character', 'violence', 'everyday', 'part', 'life', 'friends', 'regularly', 'get', 'fights', 'being', 'lured', 'closer', 'uncle', 'west', 'side', 'gang', 'Living', 'single', 'mother', 'small', 'apartment', 'only', 'way', 'Trife', 'be', 'working', 'uncle', 'must', 'decide', 'life', 'crime', 'support', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend.Alisa', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'pregnant', 'best', 'friend', 'commited', 'suicide', 'boyfriend', 'just', 'dumped', 'Feeling', 'alone', 'world', 'often', 'sexual', 'favours', 'exchange', 'drugs', 'constantly', 'harrassed', 'Sam', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'babies', 'father.Sam', 'protagonist', 'regularly', 'kids', 'school', 'violence', 'get', 'anything', 'including', 'girls', 'sam', 'who', 'chain', 'events', 'lead', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'threatening', 'kill', 'student', 'name', 'katie', 'who', 'was', 'friend', 'Alisa', 'killed', 'version', ""'kids"", 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'certainly', 'point', 'shocking', 'times', 'blunt', 'assessment', 'todays', 'youth', 'gang', 'culture', 'acting', 'times', ""n't"", 'great', 'made', 'up', 'great', 'directing', 'would', 'never', 'guess', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'low', 'budget', 'only', 'other', 'negative', 'point', 'was', 'lack', 'sub-titles', 'times', 'were', 'necessary', 'West', 'London', 'accent', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'understand', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'turn', 'off', 'American', 'very', 'powerful', 'drama', 'great', 'modern', 'soundtrack', 'watch', 'liked', ""'kids"", 'II', 'Society', 'look', 'out', 'sequel', ""'Adulthood""]",N/A
1091624,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B000TMD8ZI,Todd Smith,"[2, 5]","Kidulthood is another film that makes people want to see it, by advertising a star that's in it for all of five minutes, Nick Hoult of Skins, About A Boy, and X-Men fame. He's the reason I gave this film a chance, because honestly, the plot isn't really something that interests me. This film is so far out there and so strange, that I can't even tell you what it's about! A bullied girl in a London high school kills herself and the kids get time off from school. After that the story splinters into a million different pieces of kids running wild in the streets of London and most of it makes absolutely no sense. Kidulthood tries to become the British version of Boyz In The Hood, but completely fails. The British gangstas, aren't exactly gangsta, and things move so unbelievably fast that it's impossible to keep track of who is who and who is doing what. To sum it all up, there's no real plot, meaning there isn't much of a point to this movie. There are also far too many characters, many of whom look a like, and very few that can actually act worth a damn. Kidulthood is one big blur of violence and F-bombs without a theme, a plot, or a point. This is just another example of a movie that tries to attract people with foul language, unnecessary violence, and a marquis name that barely makes a cameo.

No doubt filled with controversy and plagued with foul language this film deals with suicide, drugs, sex and all of the temptations out there tempting our youth today. An interesting take as a U.S. viewer to see many of the same problems in England. One of the main actors (to the best of my knowledge) also directed this.
