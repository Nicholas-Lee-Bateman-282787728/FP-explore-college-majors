Zacherly, The Cool Ghoul, is a bit older and cheesier now (if you look carefully when he answers the phone you can see how arthritis has gnarled his fingers), but I still love him (he is the only known TV host of horror, SciFi, and schlock, who actually inherited the position from his dad, the original Zacherly). There are wonderful interviews with some of the people involved with Aurora (artists, sculptors, distributors, etc.) during the time of their greatest achievements.
