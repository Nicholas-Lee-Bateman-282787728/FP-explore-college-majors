It lasted for one season (13 episodes) and aired on CBS Saturday mornings in the early 1990s.  I've watched the entire set and didn't have any playability issues.  I did however notice in the episode ""Zara"" some pixelation and a loud popping noise a little before the 6 minute mark.  For only lasting one season, this set has some pretty good extras.  Two episodes have a commentary option and there is also a 30 minute documentary on the second disc.  The show itself hold ups pretty well.",4,Skeleton Warriors - The Complete Series,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,590,"['Skeleton', 'Warriors', 'Legion', 'Light', 'battles', 'evil', 'Skeleton', 'Warriors', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', '13', 'episodes', 'aired', 'CBS', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'early', '1990s', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'entire', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'playability', 'issues', 'did', 'however', 'notice', 'episode', 'Zara', 'pixelation', 'loud', 'popping', 'noise', 'little', '6', 'minute', 'mark', 'only', 'lasting', 'one', 'season', 'set', 'pretty', 'good', 'extras', 'Two', 'episodes', 'have', 'commentary', 'option', 'also', '30', 'minute', 'documentary', 'second', 'disc', 'show', 'hold', 'ups', 'pretty', 'well']",Skeleton Warriors- The Complete Series

The story didn't flow through as one solid storyline you had offshoots storylines and everything else that sometimes you're sitting there scratching your head trying for broke what's going on but the year it came out it was a pretty good cartoon. So if I can have give this a rating from five I would give it almost to four stars,4,Skeleton warriors complete series review,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,564,"['series', 'pretty', 'good', 'year', 'came', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anyone', 'go', 'action', 'very', 'little', 'commonly', 'storyline', 'couple', 'times', 'Ville', 'off', 'sometimes', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'there', 'thinking', 'what', 'going', 'here', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'flow', 'one', 'solid', 'storyline', 'had', 'offshoots', 'storylines', 'everything', 'else', 'sometimes', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'there', 'scratching', 'head', 'trying', 'broke', 'what', 'going', 'year', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'cartoon', 'can', 'have', 'give', 'rating', 'five', 'would', 'give', 'almost', 'four', 'stars']",Skeleton Warriors- The Complete Series

The first two had a disc two which loaded and started to play fine but disc one did not load at all. I waited on it and waited but I thought it was going to mess my DVD player up. I kept trying but no luck so I returned it...Now the third try DOES NOT LOAD DISC ONE OR TWO! And as if that is not bad enought the booklet was damaged AND the cardboard outer case was not in this one. I would be willing to over look that if the DVDs worked but no luck there either.I would either WAIT before buying and hope the errors are fixed, I mean you have waited this long so whats another year? OR do like I am doing and keep ordering and returning them when they don't work.The worst part is when you call and get asked ""Well did you try ANOTHER DVD player?"" Come on guys!",1,Bad BONES!
