He would have loved the irony in the way that the Senate seat re-opens.For those not familiar with Shaw's play - It was later remade as the musical ""My Fair Lady"".  OK, so now you know the story, except that this time it is was actually told better than was done in the original.  This is because this time the Eliza Doolittle character (Elliott Doolittle here) actually turns out to be man of considerable character- and someone who could actually have something to teach H. Higgins (Henry in the original play/musical, Hannah in this movie)- thus fleshing out a character that Shaw left only half formed.There are those who might complain that Shaw does not have his two leads fall inlove at the end- to which all I can say is why not?  He named his play after Pygmalion after all- did Shaw forget his Ovid?  By having this happen the movie is actually truer to the original Greek story than Shaw was.The acting was extremely well done- and the casting spot on [loved Camryn Mannheim in the role of 'Colleen' (instead of Colonel) Pickering].

It happens all the time. Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions turns a political story into a fun film. David Walton does a fantastic job as beer vendor Elliot Doolittle as he must constantly make slight changes in his dialogue brogue. Hannah (Julia Stiles) and her colleague, Colleen (Camryn Manheim), are the product manipulators in this variation of an old theme.Blame the ancient Greeks for this story line. ""Pygmalion"" was first, and that was where the idea of ""My Fair Lady"" originated. Centuries later, it's taken that long, the female leads take the lead as they transform a male character into something worthy of others. To raise HIM, Doolittle, to the upper class realm (if anyone indeed can today call politicians an `upper' class, or classy of any sort--LOL). As I stated, the show is great to watch, but come election time, a new ""real"" political version of this story will emerge once again as men and women vie for a chance to be a congressperson.In the meantime, this is a great family-friendly PG DVD to watch.

She has just made an unsuccessful bid for congress. Julia Stiles plays this very stuffy businesswoman (who has an obsession for proper English) with great skill. Her prim and unapproachable manner may have cost her the election.Elliot Doolittle is a beer vendor who happens to catch the brunt of Hannah's frustrations following her concession speech.  In spite of his unpolished manners and scruffy appearance, he seems to have a way with people. When the congressional seat suddenly becomes available again, Hannah and her business partner, Colleen, set about to remake Elliot into a viable candidate (without him realizing that is their goal).If you are familiar with the movie My Fair Lady (or the book/play Pygmalion), you will recognize the takeoff here on the Henry Higgins/Eliza Doolittle theme. And, as in the original movie, Hannah's long time friend and business partner Colleen Pickering (instead of Colonel Pickering) is more sympathetic to the Doolittle character than the Higgins character is. You will also find that Doolittle has a parent who is a little too fond of ""drink"".The story line includes politics, poverty, deceit, embarrassing viral videos, and the importance of education. In spite of all that, this is not a heavy handed ""Hall of Fame"" offering (don't get me wrong, I love those, too). There is plenty of humor and a barely detectable romance, the parts are well played, some of the characters are truly ""characters"" and I found the whole experience to be quite entertaining.

1621652,A28QU1UG32PYNV,B00B4WHKVK,"Katie A. E. ""Words-at-war""","[0, 0]","After a failed political run at Congress, uptight and implacable Hannah Higgins sets her eyes on getting her message across...through a different format: Boston native, blue collar beer vender and stand up guy, Eliot Doolittle, whose natural charm and likability seems to be the one thing that Hannah is utterly lacking in. After a complete makeover, he starts to look, as much as sound, the part and after some time, he begins to see the potential of his new self as much as aid Hannah in her own quest.The Makeover is a modern twist on George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, aka, My Fair Lady. Place names are used to reflect that but I actually didn't really associate the connection until I watched the 'behind the scenes' clip.Was this movie spine tingling? By no means. Which is its only flaw. And a big one. You have a great cast and seasoned actors who could make reading a telephone book in a monotone voice Emmy worthy, decent directing, an established plot with a very good script, good balance of most things and the look/feel is there but something is missing, something very essential. Like, the actual romance. Never mind the political aspect of this interoperation, which was handled well enough. My BIGGEST problem is the stiffness between our leads, Hannah (played by the always talented Julia Stiles) and Eliot (played by David Walton and relatively unknown)------and their utter lack of chemistry. Utter. Lack. Of. Chemistry. In the end, I was completely indifferent to their journey toward coupledom. Hannah does achieve some growth but everyone else is pretty static.In fact, Colleen (unerringly played by Cameron Manheim), as Hannah's accomplice but also her voice of reason, and Allie Doolittle (the ah-mazing character actress Francis Fisher), were both as interesting, if not more so in parts, than our own leads. Never a good thing. Great acting from solid actors and yet it missed the mark for me. It's one of those movies that I think: it had the potential to be really cute and funny, then I think, but all the ingredients were already there. I didn't not enjoy this movie, which is tame and viewable younger generations and a very wholesome film with a message about being yourself and trying to help others; however, I won't be recommending it to anyone anytime soon...",3,Wished for more.

1621657,A3LNU3T5H9OMWC,B00B4WHKVK,P. Romance,"[16, 16]","Based on Pygmalion and set in modern times, Hannah Higgins (Julia Stiles) is a Boston education consultant, whose snobby, prim and proper attitude made her lose her chance of becoming Senator.  A year later, the senate seat opens up again due to ironic circumstances.  Hannah wanted to run again but after all the negative feedback, she decides on another tactic - have someone else run in her place.  Steps in Elliot Doolittle (David Walton).  A beer vendor, Elliot wanted a job with better pay.  So, he decided to seek Hannah's help in improving his speech and demeanor.  Finding her perfect candidate, Hannah treats Elliot as her ""pet project"" and was determined to turn him into Congress material.  As they spend more time together, Hannah and Elliot began to realize that their professional relationship was becoming more.  Could this congressional race end in love?My expectations weren't high at the beginning.  But after getting pass the first 10 minutes of the movie, the plot picked up and I was undoubtedly hooked.  Overall, the movie's presentation was done very well.  The movie was well paced, with a nice balance of humor and drama.  To be honest, I thought I would be bored since I'm not into politics, but the political aspects were fascinating.  The casting was spot on.  The actors matched their characters perfectly and made them so relateable and lovable.  I found David Walton perfect in his role as Elliot Doolittle.  He was so cute and a sweetheart that you can't help but fall in love with him.  His progress were handled very nicely.  I love, love his witty comebacks.  Hannah was harder to warm up to.  She didn't change as much as I expected.  Even to the end, after seeing Elliot working so hard for her and his family, she just couldn't bend just a little bit.  I was slightly disappointed in the lack of opportunities to make her less stiff.  (After doing some research on the original story, Higgins was never suppose to change too much.  Oh well.)  The subtle chemistry between Elliot and Hannah was nicely done.  However, I was pretty down that there wasn't alot of romance.  The movie was too focused on the campaign to really focus on them.Hallmark has done it again.  A sweet, wholesome romance movie for the whole family to enjoy.  This is a clean movie.  They only kissed once at the end of the movie.  The only extra that there is a Behind the Scenes one.  It goes over the history of Pygmalion, the making of the movie and casts' interviews.  If you are currently loving the Hallmark movies, you have to add this gem to your collection.  If you are expecting something with a lot of depth and not the usual romance movie, pass this one by.  I highly recommend this movie.

1621659,A1EUI8FA4KNV95,B00B4WHKVK,Rissi,"[1, 2]","She may not have achieved the status of ""America's Sweetheart"" like Julia Roberts (they do share a first name!) or the name recognition of Reese Witherspoon yet Julia Stiles has had her share of ""sweetheart"" roles. Her popularity has fallen off since a handful of characters from some teen movies of the 1990's, and still she has an impressive list of credits. Now this adorable romantic-comedy can be added to her r&eacute;sum&eacute;. Certainly it is nothing to be ashamed of.Coming in close to her competitor in a race for congress, Hannah Higgins (Stiles) concedes her candidacy and along with business partner Colleen (Camryn Manheim), she goes back to her educational consulting work. An impeccable dresser, and boasting a speech she thinks every person should envy, Hannah abhors how the English language is being butchered - critics called her a ""cold fish"" who was unable to connect with voters like her television personality opponent. Some months later, fate hands Hannah a second chance at a special election run but campaign consultants have some stipulations: Hannah needs to change. Unable to stand the thought of adopting a posture that is less than perfect or changing her look by filling her closet with sweater sets, a new opportunity presents itself in the common worker, Elliot (David Walton). Rough around the edges, Elliot is a Boston native through and through who is looking to land a promotion. His rejection for the same job years earlier prompts him to seek the help of Hannah's professional services little realizing that she has something else entirely in mind.Being a stranger to the synopsis of this movie isn't a hindrance to any potential viewer in the case of this television movie. In ten minutes flat, it's quite obvious what writer's set out to do and the original story this teleplay took its cues from isn't hard to pick out. The only difference in this Pygmalian-esque film is the roles of Higgins and Eliza Doolittle being reversed in Hannah and Elliot whose surname is very appropriately, Doolittle (try keeping a straight face when seeing that one plastered across campaign posters!). It's a clever script believe it or not, adding enough familiarity to make the story's inspiration evident but keeping true to its own traditions and ""twists"" - the results of which are usually quite humorous; it's the little things that hold it together! Whether it be Hannah's unwillingness to try things she deems ""improper"" or Elliot's patience with a girl who infuriates him and infatuates him in a single swoop, there is a quality to this which many in its genre try for though rarely achieve.Set in modern Boston, many situations feel a bit nostalgic only because of Hannah's fabulous characterization - or perhaps it would be more accurate to say her impeccable manners considering she is in desperate need of a serious overhaul on her people skills and connecting with people on a deeper emotional platform (that part of her does get on one's nerves). Her dialect was a large part of what shaped Hannah into who she was as a character - she felt like two parts of a character, one part an Austen heroine (because of her old-fashioned, proper English) and then fitting the bill of a stuffy ""professor"" felt like second nature to her, ingrained into her personality. Two minutes before the end, we are particularly struck with just how readily Hannah is to judge and treat people as ""experiments"" by her own admission. Then there is Elliot. It may seem petty to say this but it is a delicate business in movies like this to ""makeover"" a main protagonist. Here it was remarkably well managed as so often is the case, he wasn't painfully overplayed as a crass, bachelor male who had no manners save for those more appropriate for a barn yard. Instead, true he's a slightly unkempt (it wouldn't kill you to get a haircut, Elliot!) working Bostonian (accent fully intact) who was a kind-hearted guy underneath. It made him a compelling character that we didn't mind - and in fact rooted for, watching change into someone else because where it counted, he remained the same.Movies that change the outer appearance of a main character is not a new idea. Some do this premise with pizzazz and class, then there are others (which will remain unnamed) that are more a waste of good time. Fortunately, producer Brent Shields and everyone involved pulled together a scenario in this story that is classy and really, quite fun. Early on, there were a couple of especially campy moments (particularly when considering how the special election comes about) that made me question how seriously I would be able to take the film, luckily these elements are quickly dispensed with and in its place is a delightful little gem. The acting is fabulous and the writer is no stranger to some great comedy. It was pleasant not to watch some of the usual clich&eacute;s play out (two examples come to mind) while the ending banter is quite cute even if the movie doesn't end cementing the future exactly as some viewers would wish for.
