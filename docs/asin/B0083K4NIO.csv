As best I can remember it's never been given to a science fiction film either. I'm not saying this film deserves a Best Picture Oscar, but I'm struggling to see how this could have been made any better than it was.Here's the scoop. Lovell Milo has a narcoleptic type affliction. He's afraid to go to sleep because he will wake up in some other year. He might wake up at 12 years old or at 92 and he doesn't know why until he is clued that it has something to do with his wife's death. He is reminded, by certain people throughout his time journeys, that he is here for a reason and needs to keep his eyes open if he wants to figure it out.I am simply amazed at how well realized this movie is. I thought I was in for a time jumping adventure whereby Lovell would see how his wife was going to die and be able to prevent it. What I got was so different and so wonderful it will stick with me forever. It is not unlike ""Slaughterhouse Five"" in it's basic theme, but the film makers pull a sleight of hand in the way they present it. He is a photographer and his photographs are at the heart of things and occupy every scene. His love for the art is the key to all the best things (and some of worst) that happen to him in his life. They lead him to his wonderful wife, his career, his artistic success and more.I cannot say enough about this. The film makers saw the entirety and they fill in the details to a ""T."" The scenes don't all look the same. They change with his age and the content. The continuing themes of his wife, the dogs, his father and others all work beautifully in concert. I had some reservations with T.J. Thyne as the lead because he looks a bit on the nerdy side, but he swept those reservations away in short order. Paula Rhodes, as his wife Grace, is the sweetest thing ever. I wanted to eat her up like a warm, chocolate chip cookie. I could go on and on about how great this is but why bore? Just let it be known that I find that those involved in this project did something Hollywood might not have been able to do. I hope this becomes the cult hit of all time and reaches a wide audience.If you need your endings nailed down with a railroad spike, don't bother.

The indie film ""Shuffle"" is a perfect example of my narrow-mindedness. What sounds like a low-budget straight-to-DVD knock-off of ""The Butterfly Effect"" is so much more and is teeming with heart that movie could only dream of mustering up.A man named Lovell Milo begins waking up in different eras of his life. He's living out of order and aware of it. Cryptic messages from individuals in each time period tell him to pay attention so he can help save someone's life.Director Kurt Kuenne perfectly captures on film so much genuine emotion it's almost overwhelming to watch at times. Not overwhelming in a bad way. It's in that rollercoaster ride kind of a way. I can only compare viewing ""Shuffle"" to living an entire life and its experiences in an hour and a half. Every emotional sensation you could possibly encounter runs through your body as you take it in.All of the actors in the film give outstanding performances. TJ Thyne (""Bones"") pours his entire inner self into the role of Lovell Milo. I can't imagine how hard it was for each actor to keep up with what season in their character's life they were emulating at any given moment.Dylan Spraberry does an incredible job portraying Lovell as a young boy. It had to be difficult because he plays a child who knows the future but at his actual age. This isn't a remake of ""Freaky Friday"" or ""Vice Versa."" He's 11 or 12 years old but knows what the future holds for him. Taking on a role that complex is a heavy load for any young actor to bear.The DVD comes with some comprehensive bonus features. There are video diaries from the Festival Circuit director Kurt Kuenne and actor TJ Thyne showcased the film at. A 30-minute documentary goes through the inception of the movie. The black and white director's cut is included along with a trailer. Apparently, Kuenne's preferred way for you to see the movie is in black and white, which is the way I watched it.""Shuffle"" is an uncommon film to find these days. It's a sci-fi time travel thriller which draws comparisons to movies like ""The Butterfly Effect"" and ""Memento."" Unlike many films of this nature, it ends on a high note. The journey to its conclusion is troubled and dramatic but the finale is exhilarating and doesn't leave you despondent. It's as close to a thoroughly balanced film as you can get these days.",4,"DVD Review: ""Shuffle""",1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,2496,"['never', 'feel', 'more', 'idiot', 'when', 'write', 'movie', 'judge', 'proverbial', 'book', 'cover', 'then', 'watch', 'only', 'discover', 'what', 'gem', 'almost', 'passed', 'up', 'indie', 'film', 'Shuffle', 'perfect', 'example', 'narrow-mindedness', 'What', 'low-budget', 'straight-to-DVD', 'knock-off', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'teeming', 'heart', 'movie', 'could', 'only', 'dream', 'mustering', 'up.A', 'man', 'named', 'Lovell', 'Milo', 'waking', 'up', 'different', 'eras', 'life', 'living', 'order', 'aware', 'Cryptic', 'messages', 'individuals', 'time', 'period', 'tell', 'pay', 'attention', 'can', 'help', 'save', 'someone', 'life.Director', 'Kurt', 'Kuenne', 'perfectly', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'almost', 'overwhelming', 'watch', 'times', 'Not', 'overwhelming', 'bad', 'way', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'kind', 'way', 'can', 'only', 'compare', 'viewing', 'Shuffle', 'living', 'entire', 'life', 'experiences', 'hour', 'half', 'emotional', 'sensation', 'could', 'possibly', 'encounter', 'runs', 'body', 'take', 'in.All', 'actors', 'film', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'TJ', 'Thyne', 'Bones', 'entire', 'inner', 'self', 'role', 'Lovell', 'Milo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'hard', 'was', 'actor', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'season', 'character', 'life', 'were', 'emulating', 'given', 'moment.Dylan', 'Spraberry', 'incredible', 'job', 'portraying', 'Lovell', 'young', 'boy', 'had', 'be', 'difficult', 'child', 'who', 'future', 'actual', 'age', ""n't"", 'remake', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'Vice', 'Versa', '11', '12', 'years', 'old', 'what', 'future', 'Taking', 'role', 'complex', 'heavy', 'load', 'young', 'actor', 'bear.The', 'DVD', 'comprehensive', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'video', 'diaries', 'Festival', 'Circuit', 'director', 'Kurt', 'Kuenne', 'actor', 'TJ', 'Thyne', 'showcased', 'film', '30-minute', 'documentary', 'inception', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'director', 'cut', 'included', 'trailer', 'Apparently', 'Kuenne', 'preferred', 'way', 'see', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'way', 'watched', 'Shuffle', 'uncommon', 'film', 'find', 'days', 'sci-fi', 'time', 'travel', 'thriller', 'comparisons', 'movies', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'Memento', 'many', 'films', 'nature', 'high', 'note', 'journey', 'conclusion', 'troubled', 'dramatic', 'finale', 'exhilarating', ""n't"", 'leave', 'despondent', 'as', 'close', 'thoroughly', 'balanced', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'days']",N/A

1545242,A3L0S6DUEX53ES,B0083K4NIO,Markus Youssef,"[1, 1]","Like printing a picture on a playing card, the mind creates a ""card"" for every special moment in a person's life, whether or not it was emotionally felt or realized at the time.  In this film the cards of a man's life are shuffled through in search for self understanding and direction.  The cards are especially valuable because they also offer emotional compensation during challenging times.  In one case, the cards saved a man's life when he got into a car accident.  In another, the cards provided comfort to a 92 year old man just before passing as he got to relive his most cherished memory - the moment of falling in love for the first time with his childhood sweetheart.I think the appeal of this film is that it is easy to relate to the protagonist's relationship to his memories.  For example, when he gains some life experiences and his mind creates cards for them, it is only after years or decades that he is able to really feel them in his body and connect them to his awareness.  To paraphrase King Lear - ""He sees them feelingly.""  Another problem solving puzzle-like aspect of this film is how the cards are able to guide a man in healing from a traumatic event.  In turns out that he had an angel within him all along.I imagine that there are a number of folks living in retirement homes who are shuffling through their memory cards and I think they in particular will find this movie to be a source of validation.",4,The Gifts of Memories,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,1433,"['printing', 'picture', 'playing', 'card', 'mind', 'card', 'special', 'moment', 'person', 'life', 'not', 'was', 'emotionally', 'felt', 'realized', 'time', 'film', 'cards', 'man', 'life', 'are', 'shuffled', 'search', 'self', 'understanding', 'direction', 'cards', 'are', 'especially', 'valuable', 'also', 'offer', 'emotional', 'compensation', 'challenging', 'times', 'one', 'case', 'cards', 'saved', 'man', 'life', 'when', 'got', 'car', 'accident', 'cards', 'provided', 'comfort', '92', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'just', 'before', 'passing', 'got', 'relive', 'most', 'cherished', 'memory', 'moment', 'falling', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'childhood', 'sweetheart.I', 'think', 'appeal', 'film', 'easy', 'relate', 'protagonist', 'relationship', 'memories', 'example', 'when', 'gains', 'life', 'experiences', 'mind', 'cards', 'only', 'years', 'decades', 'able', 'really', 'feel', 'body', 'connect', 'awareness', 'paraphrase', 'King', 'Lear', 'feelingly', 'problem', 'solving', 'puzzle-like', 'aspect', 'film', 'how', 'cards', 'are', 'able', 'guide', 'man', 'healing', 'traumatic', 'event', 'out', 'had', 'angel', 'along.I', 'imagine', 'are', 'number', 'folks', 'living', 'retirement', 'homes', 'who', 'are', 'shuffling', 'memory', 'cards', 'think', 'particular', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'source', 'validation']",N/A

By now it is probably too late to tell you not to read the Amazon description (and definitely do not read the back of the case).  Both give up a valuable secret of the film and for no better reason that they had no idea how to market it just like the distributors that viewed it in their private screenings without a real audience reaction.

It's sole purpose is to enlighten and entertain with one brilliant stroke after the other by it's writer and director, Kurt Kuenne.

I want it to stop."" Lovell Milo (Thyne) is trying to figure out what happened with his life. Lately he has been waking up at different ages at different times in his life. One day he will be 24 fall asleep and wake up 8. Wake up at 92 fall asleep and be 20. On top of that he has narcolepsy so he has no control over when he changes. He wakes up one morning and realizes he is engaged and he is really happy, when he wakes up again its a few years later and his wife is dead. He know is trying to do everything he can to stop that from happening. I was very much looking forward to this movie. One of the most original ideas to come out in a while. I was expecting it to be a little like ""Memento"" but it was original. The acting is OK and the movie is pretty low budget but I really enjoyed this. It gets to the point where you feel for Lovell and every time he falls asleep you feel sorry for him. The way the movie is set up you honestly can't predict what happens next witch is great and really keeps you interested the entire time. The only thing that ruined the movie is the twist at the very end. Movie is going along great and the the last 30 seconds really took all the air out of it and really disappointed me. I would still recommend this but be warned that the ending isn't satisfying. Overall, a very good low budget movie that is worth seeing but had an ending that almost ruined the movie.
