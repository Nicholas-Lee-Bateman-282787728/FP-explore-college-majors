Its embarassing.Watching this borefest you will find it extremely hard to believe that Mira Sorvino once won an Oscar.  My how she has fallen.  She preens around Spain talking in the worst Spanish accent ever.  In fact, its probably the worst accent ever done in any movie ever made.  She plays some super-agent on the trail of some killers, who happen to look like KKK members only wearing red with hoods literally standing five feet straight up in the air.  They're completely retarded looking.  Helping Sorvino out is some hunky Spaniard who can barely complete a sentence(I'm sure he needed help finding his way home each night after shooting).  The entire cast is pathetic, the dialogue supremely clunky, and the script is convoluted, confusing, and filled with gaps in logic.The only decent thing in the film is the cinematography.  The film is shot very well with a beautiful look.  Too bad the rest of the movie sucks so much rectum.  Obviously the cinematographer has some real talent but how he/she got roped into this bomb is beyond me.So if you're in the video store and see 'Angel Of Death' on the shelf, nonchalantly open the case and break the disc in half so no one else has to suffer through this piece of trash.

He blends into the easter celebration crowd, where several of the devoted also wear the same religious attire. An almost life-like cop named Maria (Mira ""I really did win an oscar you know!"" Sorvino) must stay awake long enough to earn her paycheck...er, catch the murderer. The first 40+ minutes of ANGEL OF DEATH are nearly insufferable. Like being waterboarded w/ jell-o. Sorvino drifts from scene to scene, bravely holding back the yawns that must have been fighting for release. Now, I know this gal can act (she was fantastic in MIMIC). What happened?? The rest of the cast seem furious about their being involved w/ this putrid project. Olivier Martinez's angry, chauvanistic character is so overblown and annoying that I wanted to whip him w/ a bundle of porcupines! Amazingly, the movie actually gets better in the second half, but by then I was numb and could not feel my legs.

And if you like his accent, which I do, he sounds like a completely different person, and not in a good way, I hate to admit. It's an awful movie, I hate to say, there's no positive spin I can put on it.

This is an ok made for cable movie. I have seen thousands of these type films on cable and this will probably end up another lost in cable movie. Oliver Martinez looked like he was forced to be in this film. There was no chemistry between Sorvino and Martinez. They seemed like they hated each other and couldn't co-exsist together in this film. There was also really no suspense since the characters didn't make it interesting. I know these actors are good actors, but they were acting like typical B-actors if even that. Now I know why this movie has stayed away from American theaters. This was a hard to swallow film that moved very slowley and the actors didn't help. If this movie is on cable give it a try. I wouldn't waste my money buying this movie or renting it either. You will waste your money. If you want to see a great movie with religious themes try ""The Da Vince Code"" or ""Angels and Demons"" these movies are a lot better and in the same genre.

865684,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006FO4YW,Tsuyoshi,"[10, 13]","Mira Sorvino and Olivier Martinez star in 'Angel of Death' (origianally called 'Semana Santa') produced by European film companies from as many as six countries -- Germany, Italy, England, France, Spain, and Denmark.  The film was theatrically released back in 2002 in France.  Since then three years have passed, but probably you still never heard of the film.  No wonder, because the film is so bad, so dull, and so sleep-inducing.While all the dialogues are spoken in English, 'Angel of Death' is set in Spain, and Mira Sorvino plays Maria, detective transfered from Madrid to Seville.  During the celebration of Semana Santa, she is given a case of brutal murders, committed by a serial killer in red robe.  With chauvinist cop Quemada (Olivier Martinez, 'Unfaithful' 'Taking Lives'), Maria starts the investigation, picking up the clues, and confronting the uncorporative section of the ... are you still listening?The clithe-ridden script is no help when director (or whoever involved in this film) does not know how to show thrills and suspence on screen.  When you see the killings on screen, they are all shown in the most banal way; you watch, 1) a victim; 2) a killer; 3) the former is attacked (with no preliminary part to enhance the tension, in the same fashion as cheap TV games), and 4) dead body or injured character.  The film refuses to scare us, or even the victims themselves, and the results are utterly thrill-less thriller.  That's surely achievement, sort of.But what Mira Sorvino is doing here?  Detective Maria Delgado, wearing tailor-made suit and skirt?  She sports curious Spanish accent (which suddenly vanishes at times), but that is not the worst part of it.  Her acting itself is probably the worst in her career, and she literally sleepwalks, and sometimes looks as if she knew this film would be a flop.  Olivier Martinez, always oceracting, is no better, and I thought, isn't he a French?  Only special appearance by Alida Vali ('The Third Man' and Dario Argento films like 'Suspiria') offers some dignity, and her character's flashback sub-plot is more interesting than the main one.The director fails to show any clear motive of the killer.  Consequently we see dead bodies, but have no opportunities to understand the reason for the killing.  The police do not know even the rudimentary procedures of investigation, and are often so stupid that one of them does not do anything useful until the story comes nearly to the end, but all of a sudden he becomes wise, and gets the answer!I give two stars simply because I like Mira Sorvino, who is Oscar winner (just in case if you forgot it).  She's the only reason for two stars, and no other.  Not that her acting is great.
