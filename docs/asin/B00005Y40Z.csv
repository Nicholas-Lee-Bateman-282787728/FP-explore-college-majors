688689,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B00005Y40Z,Chip Kaufmann,"[5, 5]","I first saw this movie at a drive-in back in 1971 along with several other features which I don't recall. Having been a Boris Karloff fan since the age of 8, I had to see it and I remember being struck at the time by how old he looked (he was 79 then and had been dead for 2 years by the time I saw it) and by how cool it would be if you really could experience other people's sensations (the principal plot device of this film). It was only much later that I realized that THE SORCERERS was made by Michael Reeves the same man responsible for WITCHFINDER GENERAL.Just how familiar Reeves was with Karloff's ""Mad Doctor"" films, I don't know (there are definite echoes of 1936's THE MAN WHO CHANGED HIS MIND), but THE SORCERERS is certainly an interesting and appropriate update on that theme. An elderly hypnotist and his wife (the ""sorcerers"" of the title) develop a system of advanced hypnosis that enable them to not only control a young man (Ian Ogilvy) but to feel what he feels. Things ultimately veer out of control as the embittered wife wants to experience more and more sensations including murder (a young Susan George is the victim) which leads to tragedy for everyone concerned.The Swinging 60s setting (the film was made in 1967) is dated to be sure but fascinating nonetheless. Karloff is his usual fine self even at the age of 79 and crippled by arthritis but it is Catherine Lacey as his wife who gives a truly remarkable performance. She reportedly hated her role just as Vincent Price hated his in WITCHFINDER GENERAL yet Reeves proved himself right in the end as both performances are among their best. A truly fine example of what can be done on a meager budget with a multi-layered screenplay and a good role for Boris at the end of his career. This is the American Allied Artists release.

688692,A1AQ9R3L8ZWWEC,B00005Y40Z,"LMG ""ancient art prof""","[0, 2]","This film had many aspects to it and seem to promise much until it went way over the top. Boris Karloff (looking like all of his 79 years by 1960s standards) plays a superhypnotist named Marcus. His wife Estelle who looks even older, played by Catherine Lacey, is his partner in mind control.A young man (Ian Ogilvy, THE SAINT, etc.) is coaxed into allowing himself to participate in a hypnotic experiment that will allow Boris and Catherine (Boris & Natasha?) to control him even from afar and live vicariously through him after decades of deprivation.Things take a horrific turn when Boris's frustrated wife gains the upper hand (mind) and is able to make Ogilvy do murderous things. That's how she gets her kicks. Boris, however, wanted his scientific discovery available to the general old age public so that it (they) could once again experience those positive things that they once enjoyed in their youthful past. By today's standards, what the ""elderly"" are able to do in their ""Golden Years"" makes this movie's premise almost laughable. The two can feel every sensation experienced by Ogilvy (except when he practically chain smokes! - which probably would have killed B&C; outright or eventually overwhelmed them). They can ""feel"" murder but not smoking.How Boris got the funds to build all of his ""scientific equipment"", which looks appropriately enough like something out of an earlier Universal ""Frankenstein"" movie, is never explained. It certainly must have cost a bundle. If the couple had spent it instead on having a good time, they never would have had to build it in the first place. Oh! Wait...I nearly forgot that this was a movie.Some of the basic problems of this movie, which should at least get some credit for contrasting how the old saw themselves at that time compared to the young, has to do with basic behavioral situations. Supposedly, one would not murder someone even under a hypnotic spell if it was not in his nature. Therefore, it's a puzzlement over how easy it was to get Ogilvy to do it.  What possessed Catherine to act in the specific way that she did? Wouldn't Boris for all his knowledge and insight have caught on long before, after knowing her for at least 50 years?! Evidently, she wanted power more than enjoyment; in which case, she should have married someone else. While her performance was indeed ""mesmerising"", it was also frustrating for the viewer who begins to feel like Boris while his wife goes about her merry murdering. And didn't the neighbors hear anything when all the equipment was functioning or when Catherine destroyed it all? Or, are we to assume that nothing but deaf old people surrounded them.If you really want to enjoy Boris in his later years, watch some of the various horror movie parodies by Vincent Price and Peter Lorre.",3,MESMER WEPT,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,2798,"['film', 'had', 'many', 'aspects', 'seem', 'promise', 'much', 'went', 'way', 'top', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'looking', '79', 'years', '1960s', 'standards', 'superhypnotist', 'named', 'Marcus', 'wife', 'Estelle', 'who', 'even', 'older', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Lacey', 'partner', 'mind', 'control.A', 'young', 'man', 'Ian', 'Ogilvy', 'THE', 'SAINT', 'etc', 'coaxed', 'allowing', 'participate', 'hypnotic', 'experiment', 'will', 'allow', 'Boris', 'Catherine', 'Boris', 'Natasha', 'control', 'even', 'afar', 'live', 'vicariously', 'decades', 'deprivation.Things', 'take', 'horrific', 'turn', 'when', 'Boris', 'frustrated', 'wife', 'gains', 'upper', 'hand', 'mind', 'able', 'make', 'Ogilvy', 'do', 'murderous', 'things', 'how', 'kicks', 'Boris', 'however', 'wanted', 'scientific', 'discovery', 'available', 'general', 'old', 'age', 'public', 'so', 'could', 'once', 'again', 'experience', 'positive', 'things', 'once', 'enjoyed', 'youthful', 'past', 'today', 'standards', 'what', 'elderly', 'are', 'able', 'do', 'Golden', 'Years', 'movie', 'premise', 'almost', 'laughable', 'two', 'can', 'feel', 'sensation', 'experienced', 'Ogilvy', 'when', 'practically', 'chain', 'smokes', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'B', 'C', 'outright', 'eventually', 'overwhelmed', 'can', 'feel', 'murder', 'not', 'smoking.How', 'Boris', 'got', 'funds', 'build', 'scientific', 'equipment', 'appropriately', 'enough', 'something', 'earlier', 'Universal', 'Frankenstein', 'movie', 'never', 'explained', 'certainly', 'must', 'have', 'cost', 'bundle', 'couple', 'had', 'spent', 'instead', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'build', 'first', 'place', 'Oh', 'Wait', 'nearly', 'forgot', 'was', 'movie.Some', 'basic', 'problems', 'movie', 'should', 'least', 'get', 'credit', 'contrasting', 'how', 'old', 'saw', 'time', 'compared', 'young', 'do', 'basic', 'behavioral', 'situations', 'Supposedly', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'murder', 'someone', 'even', 'hypnotic', 'spell', 'was', 'not', 'nature', 'Therefore', 'puzzlement', 'how', 'easy', 'was', 'get', 'Ogilvy', 'do', 'What', 'possessed', 'Catherine', 'act', 'specific', 'way', 'did', 'Would', ""n't"", 'Boris', 'knowledge', 'insight', 'have', 'caught', 'long', 'before', 'knowing', 'least', '50', 'years', 'Evidently', 'wanted', 'power', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'case', 'should', 'have', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'performance', 'was', 'indeed', 'mesmerising', 'was', 'also', 'frustrating', 'viewer', 'who', 'feel', 'Boris', 'wife', 'merry', 'murdering', 'did', ""n't"", 'neighbors', 'hear', 'anything', 'when', 'equipment', 'was', 'functioning', 'when', 'Catherine', 'destroyed', 'are', 'assume', 'nothing', 'deaf', 'old', 'people', 'surrounded', 'them.If', 'really', 'want', 'enjoy', 'Boris', 'later', 'years', 'watch', 'various', 'horror', 'movie', 'parodies', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Peter', 'Lorre']",The Sorcerers

This film is the rarest of the only 3 films directed by Michael Reeves before his apparent suicide at only 24 in 1969. Karloff and his wife, excellently played by Catherine Lacy, are an elderly poor couple who lure a bored Mod Londoner, who is looking for some extra kicks, to their apartment where they administer experiments in mind control. The youth's name is Michael Roscoe, and is well-played by Ian Ogilvy. The couple have invented a machine that can control other's actions and then transfer the sensations back to the couple. The Professor's intentions are good but his maniacal wife has other ideas. She uses her superior will power to overcome her husbands and subsequently starts with speeding on a motorcycle. She then utilizes Michael to steal an expensive fur coat which then leads to controlling Michael to actually commit murder. As I already mentioned, Karloff had intended to use the machine for the benefit of all, but his wife Estelle, who is deranged and intrigued by the machine's deviant potential, has more sinister ideas in mind. The film can certainly be taken as a cautionary, as well as a cynical take on the dangers of youthful hedonism. The story takes place in 60's Mod London, with mini-skirts, groovy underground dancing clubs and 60's bands. Actually, this dated the film, but to me, in a good way. When one thinks about it, the premise of controlling someone else's mind and then sharing their sensations is actually quite fascinating to me. Overall, the acting is quite good, the direction and the cinematography is excellent, and the editing is very good. As noted, the film is in color, with the transfer being very good.

688695,A2D63RN5LF14R2,B00005Y40Z,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[1, 1]","Michael Reeves&#8217; The Sorcerers (1967), starring Boris Karloff, became a barely noticeable cult film in a cinematically innovative era. A few prominent, hip critics took note of Reeves, and, in some quarters, predictions were made that he could become a horror director of the caliber of James Whale, Tod Browning, Jacques Tourneur, or Terence Fisher.Reeves&#8217; had only made one previous film, the low budget The She Beast (1966) starring horror icon Barbara Steele, but it was imitative of Mario Bava&#8216;s work and received scant notice. In contrast, The Sorcerers was stylish, quirky, and unique, although it was also low budget and barely made a profit. Still, it resulted in Reeves&#8217; being given a larger bankroll to work with in his third film: the critical and box office hit Witchfinder General (1968) starring Vincent Price.Reeves&#8217; death of a drug overdose at twenty-five, shortly before the release of Witchfinder General, affected that film&#8217;s reputation. Reeves was hailed as a tragic auteur in the James Dean mold. Since then, Witchfinder General has long been lauded as one of Price&#8217;s finest films. Its was considerably helped by the actor/star himself, who listed it as one of his two personal favorites, along with Theater of Blood (1973). Having a historical subject, Witchfinder General defies its period, is highly esteemed, frequently revived, and has been readily available throughout the video age.In light of Witchfunder General&#8217; s reputation, The Sorcerers was considered a lesser, obscure effort, partly because it seemed more dated and did not have a vital star to promote it (Karloff died a mere week before Reeves). Nor did the actor&#8217;s fans promote it. Instead, of Karloff&#8217;s late films, they waxed sentimental about Peter Bogdanovich&#8217;s Targets (1968), feeling that film was a truer coda for the &#8220;King of Horror.&#8221; It was only this year that The Sorcerers was finally made available on DVD as part of the Warner Archive collection.The aged and poverty stricken Professor Marcus Monserrat (Karloff) is a long publicly disgraced hypnotist who invents a machine (cue sci-fi mumbo jumbo) which allows him and his wife Estelle (the delightfully vile Catherine Lacey) to project their consciousness into the minds of others. The Monserrats live in a dilapidated London flat during the swinging 60s (cue sex, drugs, and rock n&#8217; roll), and Estelle is corrupted from bitterness due to her husband&#8217;s fall from grace. The couple find a willing guinea pig for their gizmo in stud Michael (Ian Ogilvy). Michael, bored with sex, drugs, and rock n&#8217; roll, agrees to be strapped into the Professor&#8217;s mind-altering gizmo (cue psychedelia). Although clearly a product of the 60&#8242;s, The Sorcerers is imbued with a stylish, compact, contemporary impudence that transcends mere period novelty.Once the couple psyche into Mike&#8217;s experiences, Estelle begins making up for lost years. She quickly becomes addicted to the experience, which causes her to become increasingly imbalanced. After she forces Mike into hedonism, theft, and murder, a battle of wills between Estelle and her husband leads into Being John Malkovich (1999) and Scanners (1981) territory.The Sorcerers stands out as a respite from Karloff&#8217;s humiliating last years. Although seriously ill, the actor gives an admirably subdued performance that rises to a crescendo in the final showdown with his wife. As good as Karloff and Ogilvy are, it is Lacey who steals the film.The lower budget trappings actually enhance the grittiness of a film that seems to be saying something about the jaded nihilism of the &#8220;I, me, mine&#8221; culture (well, at least it noticed it).",5,Stylish Grit,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,3750,"['Michael', 'Reeves', '8217', 'Sorcerers', '1967', 'starring', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'became', 'barely', 'noticeable', 'cult', 'film', 'cinematically', 'innovative', 'era', 'few', 'prominent', 'hip', 'critics', 'took', 'note', 'Reeves', 'quarters', 'predictions', 'were', 'made', 'could', 'become', 'horror', 'director', 'caliber', 'James', 'Whale', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'Jacques', 'Tourneur', 'Terence', 'Fisher.Reeves', '8217', 'had', 'only', 'made', 'one', 'previous', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'Beast', '1966', 'starring', 'horror', 'icon', 'Barbara', 'Steele', 'was', 'imitative', 'Mario', 'Bava', '8216', 'work', 'received', 'scant', 'notice', 'contrast', 'Sorcerers', 'was', 'stylish', 'quirky', 'unique', 'was', 'also', 'low', 'budget', 'barely', 'made', 'profit', 'Still', 'resulted', 'Reeves', '8217', 'being', 'given', 'larger', 'bankroll', 'work', 'third', 'film', 'critical', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'Witchfinder', 'General', '1968', 'starring', 'Vincent', 'Price.Reeves', '8217', 'death', 'drug', 'overdose', 'twenty-five', 'shortly', 'release', 'Witchfinder', 'General', 'affected', 'film', '8217', 's', 'reputation', 'Reeves', 'was', 'hailed', 'tragic', 'auteur', 'James', 'Dean', 'mold', 'then', 'Witchfinder', 'General', 'long', 'been', 'lauded', 'one', 'Price', '8217', 'finest', 'films', 'was', 'considerably', 'helped', 'actor/star', 'who', 'listed', 'one', 'two', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Theater', 'Blood', '1973', 'Having', 'historical', 'subject', 'Witchfinder', 'General', 'period', 'highly', 'esteemed', 'frequently', 'revived', 'been', 'readily', 'available', 'video', 'age.In', 'light', 'Witchfunder', 'General', '8217', 's', 'reputation', 'Sorcerers', 'was', 'considered', 'lesser', 'obscure', 'effort', 'partly', 'seemed', 'more', 'dated', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'vital', 'star', 'promote', 'Karloff', 'died', 'mere', 'week', 'Reeves', 'did', 'actor', '8217', 'fans', 'promote', 'Instead', 'Karloff', '8217', 's', 'late', 'films', 'waxed', 'sentimental', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', '8217', 's', 'Targets', '1968', 'feeling', 'film', 'was', 'truer', 'coda', '8220', 'King', 'Horror.', '8221', 'was', 'only', 'year', 'Sorcerers', 'was', 'finally', 'made', 'available', 'DVD', 'part', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'collection.The', 'aged', 'poverty', 'stricken', 'Professor', 'Marcus', 'Monserrat', 'Karloff', 'long', 'publicly', 'disgraced', 'hypnotist', 'who', 'machine', 'cue', 'sci-fi', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'wife', 'Estelle', 'delightfully', 'vile', 'Catherine', 'Lacey', 'project', 'consciousness', 'minds', 'others', 'Monserrats', 'live', 'dilapidated', 'London', 'flat', 'swinging', '60s', 'cue', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'n', '8217', 'roll', 'Estelle', 'corrupted', 'bitterness', 'due', 'husband', '8217', 'fall', 'grace', 'couple', 'find', 'willing', 'guinea', 'pig', 'gizmo', 'stud', 'Michael', 'Ian', 'Ogilvy', 'Michael', 'bored', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'n', '8217', 'roll', 'be', 'strapped', 'Professor', '8217', 'mind-altering', 'gizmo', 'cue', 'psychedelia', 'clearly', 'product', '60', '8242', 'Sorcerers', 'imbued', 'stylish', 'compact', 'contemporary', 'impudence', 'mere', 'period', 'couple', 'psyche', 'Mike', '8217', 's', 'experiences', 'Estelle', 'making', 'up', 'lost', 'years', 'quickly', 'becomes', 'addicted', 'experience', 'become', 'increasingly', 'imbalanced', 'Mike', 'hedonism', 'theft', 'murder', 'battle', 'wills', 'Estelle', 'husband', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', '1999', 'Scanners', '1981', 'territory.The', 'Sorcerers', 'out', 'respite', 'Karloff', '8217', 'humiliating', 'last', 'years', 'seriously', 'ill', 'actor', 'admirably', 'subdued', 'performance', 'crescendo', 'final', 'showdown', 'wife', 'As', 'good', 'Karloff', 'Ogilvy', 'are', 'Lacey', 'who', 'film.The', 'lower', 'budget', 'trappings', 'actually', 'enhance', 'grittiness', 'film', 'be', 'saying', 'something', 'jaded', 'nihilism', '8220', '8221', 'culture', 'well', 'least', 'noticed']",The Sorcerers

The 23 year old Reeves was cutting his teeth in film production and his persistence and love of film would have him complete the foreign 'CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD'- 1964 and proceed to his first feature 'THE SHE BEAST'-1965 with actress Barbara Steele.  Producer Tony Tenser at Tigon Films was always looking for independent film makers looking for backing.  American Producer Patrick Curtis who was married to Raquel Welch at that time had two scripts which he wanted Reeves to direct.  Putting those scripts on hold , Curtis and Reeves came up with the basic plot of 'THE SORCERERS' co authored with Tom Baker and through an acquaintance, it came across Tenser's desk. Karloff was no slouch to this type of script having mind swapped decades back in Britain with Director Robert Stevenson's excellent 'THE MAN WHO CHANGED HIS MIND'-1936.  Reeves had Karloff in mind for this film and they got along wonderfully .  The film emerges as a chilling prospect of the older generation wishing for eternal youth which theme would eventually peak in Director Bernard McEveety's chilling masterpiece 'THE BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN'- 1970.  It also stars Catherine Lacey in a scene stealing performance and Reeves's friend Ian Ogilvy who would appear in all three of Reeves films. You will also glimpse a 17 year old Susan George in her first feature appearance as a doomed girl friend of Ogilvy's.  Appearing as a sixties time capsule with its rock music and psychedelic lighting, the film shows Director Reeves honing his craft which would come to fruition in his masterpiece 'WITCHFINDER GENERAL' aka 'THE CONQUEROR WORM'- 1968 and who got Horror icon Vincent Price to emote one of his greatest performances. With brilliant editing by David Woodward and superb photography by John Mantell, Reeves orchestrates his mind swap plot with a snap-crackle-pop pace making it more tragic that Reeves's life was cut off too soon due to a drug overdose just before he was to direct 'THE OBLONG BOX'.  The film has been rarely seen having been released on VHS by Allied Artists back in the eighties in a horrible transfer and badly cut (surprisingly , there is no nudity in the film and has some minor gore scenes).  Warner Archive has released it in its first DVD transfer in the United States in its proper 1.85 ratio but no negative clean up which makes the film look more cutting edge than ever.  Unfortunately, their are no extras, it would have been nice to see a feature on Director Reeves or even an original trailer but it's not to be.  Warner, however, deserves kudos for giving Karloff fans a glimpse of one of his final performances even through the pain he must have been feeling in his scenes (you can see him wincing as he sits in a chair or walks across a room).  He was a real trooper and a brilliant artist who along with Director Michael Reeves created a unique be-careful-what-you- wish-for thriller.",4,Karloff's Final Mind Swap,1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,3313,"['final', 'years', 'Horror', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'always', 'said', 'interviewers', 'would', 'never', 'stop', 'acting', 'would', 'die', 'harness', 'unfortunately', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'would', 'happen', 'did', 'have', 'fortune', 'acting', 'two', 'young', 'film', 'makers', 'who', 'would', 'utilize', 'best', 'final', 'roles', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', ""'TARGETS'-1968"", 'Director', 'Michael', 'Reeve', ""SORCERERS'-1967"", '23', 'year', 'old', 'Reeves', 'was', 'cutting', 'teeth', 'film', 'production', 'persistence', 'love', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'complete', 'foreign', ""'CASTLE"", 'THE', 'LIVING', ""DEAD'-"", '1964', 'proceed', 'first', 'feature', 'SHE', ""BEAST'-1965"", 'actress', 'Barbara', 'Steele', 'Producer', 'Tony', 'Tenser', 'Tigon', 'Films', 'was', 'always', 'looking', 'independent', 'film', 'makers', 'looking', 'backing', 'American', 'Producer', 'Patrick', 'Curtis', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'time', 'had', 'two', 'scripts', 'wanted', 'Reeves', 'direct', 'Putting', 'scripts', 'hold', 'Curtis', 'Reeves', 'came', 'up', 'basic', 'plot', ""'THE"", 'SORCERERS', 'co', 'authored', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'acquaintance', 'came', 'Tenser', 'desk', 'Karloff', 'was', 'slouch', 'type', 'script', 'having', 'mind', 'swapped', 'decades', 'back', 'Britain', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Stevenson', 'excellent', ""'THE"", 'MAN', 'WHO', 'CHANGED', 'HIS', ""MIND'-1936"", 'Reeves', 'had', 'Karloff', 'mind', 'film', 'got', 'along', 'wonderfully', 'film', 'chilling', 'prospect', 'older', 'generation', 'wishing', 'eternal', 'youth', 'theme', 'would', 'eventually', 'peak', 'Director', 'Bernard', 'McEveety', 'chilling', 'masterpiece', ""'THE"", 'BROTHERHOOD', ""SATAN'-"", '1970', 'also', 'Catherine', 'Lacey', 'scene', 'stealing', 'performance', 'Reeves', 'friend', 'Ian', 'Ogilvy', 'who', 'would', 'appear', 'three', 'Reeves', 'films', 'will', 'also', 'glimpse', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Susan', 'George', 'first', 'feature', 'appearance', 'doomed', 'girl', 'friend', 'Ogilvy', 'Appearing', 'sixties', 'time', 'capsule', 'rock', 'music', 'psychedelic', 'lighting', 'film', 'shows', 'Director', 'Reeves', 'honing', 'craft', 'would', 'come', 'fruition', 'masterpiece', 'GENERAL', 'aka', ""'THE"", 'CONQUEROR', ""WORM'-"", '1968', 'who', 'got', 'Horror', 'icon', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'emote', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'brilliant', 'editing', 'David', 'Woodward', 'superb', 'photography', 'John', 'Mantell', 'mind', 'swap', 'plot', 'snap-crackle-pop', 'pace', 'making', 'more', 'tragic', 'Reeves', 'life', 'was', 'cut', 'off', 'too', 'soon', 'due', 'drug', 'overdose', 'just', 'was', 'direct', ""'THE"", 'OBLONG', 'BOX', 'film', 'been', 'rarely', 'seen', 'having', 'been', 'released', 'VHS', 'Allied', 'Artists', 'back', 'eighties', 'horrible', 'transfer', 'badly', 'cut', 'surprisingly', 'nudity', 'film', 'minor', 'gore', 'scenes', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'released', 'first', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'United', 'States', 'proper', '1.85', 'ratio', 'negative', 'clean', 'up', 'film', 'look', 'more', 'cutting', 'edge', 'ever', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'extras', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'feature', 'Director', 'Reeves', 'even', 'original', 'trailer', 'not', 'be', 'Warner', 'however', 'kudos', 'giving', 'Karloff', 'fans', 'glimpse', 'one', 'final', 'performances', 'even', 'pain', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'feeling', 'scenes', 'can', 'see', 'wincing', 'chair', 'walks', 'room', 'was', 'real', 'trooper', 'brilliant', 'artist', 'who', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Reeves', 'created', 'unique', 'be-careful-what-you-', 'wish-for', 'thriller']",The Sorcerers
