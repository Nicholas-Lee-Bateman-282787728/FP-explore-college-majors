The music was captivating to me, even as an eight year old. However, I always remember being terrified of the album cover, to the point where my brother would have to turn it backwards, in the room we shared just to get me to go to sleep.As I got older, the fear lessened and the appreciation grew. I was, being a youngster, never able to see any incarnation of King Crimson Mk.1 Imagine my excitement when the band reformed on the eighties. Now I would finally get a chance to see them.As it turned out as I drove to the outdoor venue in 1984 the show was ""rained out"", thus cancelled (...look it up in the ""Frame By Frame"" box set booklet. A storm knocked out the power, which no one knew of until they got to the theatre gate)Needless to say, when the guys played the same venue the next year, I was there. The show went on as it was supposed to.Yet to me the great thing was, after they opened with a scorching version of ""Red"", Adrian Belew stepped to the mike and gave a heart-felt apology for the events of the previous year.I understand tha t this DVD is not of that show, but it is from the same tour. I will always respect this band for at least acknowledging their fans and the show that they missed out on.Just thinking about this aspect of it made me smile...a lot....and the show is awesome as well",5,...boy did this bring back memories!,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,1438,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'King', 'Crimson', 'begrudgingly', 'first', 'album', 'older', 'brother', 'bought', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'music', 'was', 'captivating', 'even', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'However', 'always', 'remember', 'being', 'terrified', 'album', 'cover', 'point', 'where', 'brother', 'would', 'have', 'turn', 'backwards', 'room', 'shared', 'just', 'get', 'go', 'sleep.As', 'got', 'older', 'fear', 'lessened', 'appreciation', 'grew', 'was', 'being', 'youngster', 'never', 'able', 'see', 'incarnation', 'King', 'Crimson', 'Mk.1', 'Imagine', 'excitement', 'when', 'band', 'reformed', 'eighties', 'Now', 'would', 'finally', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'turned', 'out', 'drove', 'outdoor', 'venue', '1984', 'show', 'was', 'rained', 'out', 'thus', 'cancelled', 'look', 'up', 'Frame', 'Frame', 'box', 'set', 'booklet', 'storm', 'knocked', 'out', 'power', 'one', 'knew', 'got', 'theatre', 'gate', 'Needless', 'say', 'when', 'guys', 'played', 'same', 'venue', 'next', 'year', 'was', 'there', 'show', 'went', 'was', 'supposed', 'to.Yet', 'great', 'thing', 'was', 'opened', 'scorching', 'version', 'Red', 'Adrian', 'Belew', 'stepped', 'mike', 'gave', 'heart-felt', 'apology', 'events', 'previous', 'year.I', 'understand', 'tha', 't', 'DVD', 'not', 'show', 'same', 'tour', 'will', 'always', 'respect', 'band', 'least', 'acknowledging', 'fans', 'show', 'missed', 'out', 'on.Just', 'thinking', 'aspect', 'made', 'smile', 'lot', '.and', 'show', 'awesome', 'as', 'well']",N/A

This features both the band's 1980's concert videos in one release. Although the Live In Japan video is from the 1991 reissue which features different song placements than the first 80's release as well as leaving off Discipline. Both Live In Japan 1984 and Live In Frejus 1982 were originally tv specials if I remember right. The performances here are excellent and I find it hard to single out favorites. The band is in top form in both shows. The 1982 show they were sharing a bill with Roxy Music. I wish that they had released some extra songs on here but I am happy that Robert Fripp saw fit to release these together one one release instead of dragging it out and making us have to buy them separate.

Once upon a time, I wrote a review for this, way back when I had dial up, I wrote a review and it was under my wife's name.  Well, she didn't like that, and she is no longer my wife, but I digress. I just watched some of this the other night, and I feel the need to put in a new review.  This performance is just radical.  Belew and Fripp on guitar are all over the place, from atmospheric passages to metallic soloing and chords.  Tony Levin on bass is incredible!  He WORKS it!!  It is also very cool to see him on stick and keyboards.  Bill Bruford on drums is fantastic!  Whether he is hitting is regular kit, or using the electronic drums, or the effects boards, it is just crazy to see him do his thing.  The music is complicated, fresh, invigorating!  People like to bag on the 80's for music, but there is no doubt  a lot of the albums that came out of 80-90 period are quality art.  Some Crimson fans also like to bag on this period of the band's history, I don't know what to say about that, because I really enjoy all their stuff.  I would suggest getting the  Discipline album and listening to it.  If you enjoy any of it, then you should check out this live in Japan show.

844999,A2OEJKLCLVHZBY,B0002TT0GO,Michael Bettine,"[13, 13]","This DVD combines 2 different concerts of the '80s era King Crimson (both were available separately on VCR). First, from 1982, is ""The Noise - Live in Frejus."" The band we get here is a bit on the edge and even raw at times. The concert opens with ""Waiting Man,"" featuring the tribal Simmons drum duo of Bruford/Belew. The DVD is worth the money for just this one track. The drums and Levin's Chapman Stick pound out the hypnotic rhythm while Fripp adds counter rhythms and counter melodies. ""Matte Kudasai,"" ""The Sheltering Sky,"" and ""Heartbeat"" show the softer side of Crimson with Belew delivering solid vocals. ""Larks Tongues In Aspic Part II"" finds the Crims tearing into the song, full of energy and aggression. The band is superb throughout.The second concert is 1984's ""Three Of A Perfect Pair - Live in Japan."" Two years down the road finds the band less edgy and more sophisticated. Comparing tracks, like ""Waiting Man,"" shows them to have matured as a band, but perhaps at the cost of losing their initial 'edge.' Belew has grown more confident in his singing and fronting the band, while Fripp appears more reticent. Outstanding tracks are an impassioned ""Frame By Frame,"" a gentle ""Matte Kudasai,"" and the industrial noise fest of ""Industry.""Bonuses are Tony's road photos and the rarely seen Crimson video for ""Sleepless."" The video quality is generally excellent throughout, although there are some more grainy sequences and minor defects coming from the original source films/tapes. Despite these minor flaws, this is an excellent document of the '80s era Crimson and highly recommended. 2005 Michael Bettine",5,Two Views of Crimson Past,1114214400,"04 23, 2005",2005,1624,"['DVD', '2', 'different', 'concerts', ""'80s"", 'era', 'King', 'Crimson', 'were', 'available', 'separately', 'VCR', 'First', '1982', 'Noise', 'Live', 'Frejus', 'band', 'get', 'here', 'bit', 'edge', 'even', 'raw', 'times', 'concert', 'Waiting', 'Man', 'featuring', 'tribal', 'Simmons', 'drum', 'duo', 'Bruford/Belew', 'DVD', 'money', 'just', 'one', 'track', 'drums', 'Levin', 'Chapman', 'Stick', 'pound', 'hypnotic', 'rhythm', 'Fripp', 'counter', 'rhythms', 'counter', 'melodies', 'Matte', 'Kudasai', 'Sheltering', 'Sky', 'Heartbeat', 'show', 'softer', 'side', 'Crimson', 'Belew', 'delivering', 'solid', 'vocals', 'Larks', 'Tongues', 'Aspic', 'Part', 'II', 'Crims', 'tearing', 'song', 'full', 'energy', 'aggression', 'band', 'superb', 'throughout.The', 'second', 'concert', '1984', 'Three', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Pair', 'Live', 'Japan', 'Two', 'years', 'road', 'band', 'less', 'edgy', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'Comparing', 'tracks', 'Waiting', 'Man', 'have', 'matured', 'band', 'perhaps', 'cost', 'losing', 'initial', ""'edge"", 'Belew', 'grown', 'more', 'confident', 'singing', 'fronting', 'band', 'Fripp', 'more', 'reticent', 'Outstanding', 'tracks', 'are', 'impassioned', 'Frame', 'Frame', 'gentle', 'Matte', 'Kudasai', 'industrial', 'noise', 'fest', 'Industry', 'Bonuses', 'are', 'Tony', 'road', 'photos', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Crimson', 'video', 'Sleepless', 'video', 'quality', 'generally', 'excellent', 'are', 'more', 'grainy', 'sequences', 'minor', 'defects', 'coming', 'original', 'source', 'films/tapes', 'minor', 'flaws', 'excellent', 'document', ""'80s"", 'era', 'Crimson', 'highly', 'recommended', '2005', 'Michael', 'Bettine']",N/A

The double trio would not have been possible without the successes and failures of this band, and these two concerts show both, redeeming the failures considerably. One could argue that Bruford's departure from the double trio had more to do with the King's next course of action than any active creative input, and his absence may be the one thing still haunting Crimson and its Prime Minister. Levin has returned to the stick and that only serves to make conspicuous Bruford's absence. Mastelloto's is not a simple fate.As to here, though, neither of these shows is the absolute and categorical triumph of ABSENT LOVERS, the double CD of the last show in Montreal. No matter, they present the King in full roar. The Spanish film at Frejus suffers from a less than wonderful sound, although the DGM team has performed a miracle in getting it to sound as good as it does. The Japan show is hampered by absolutely silly video tricks that are just plain amateurish, especially when stacked in this compilation with Tony Levin's home movies and photos!The Japan show does have a tremendously enhanced audio component to it.  KC was never much of a visula treat, in fact they are often humourously casting aspersions on most pyro and other technics, and such is the case here. We are offered two concerts with Belew in various styles of Hugh Hefner pajamas (Fripp so desperately wants girls to like Crimson, hmmm), and Fripp in either black tux or white dinner jacket. God bless him, he singlehandedly redeems every English dweeb on the planet. Thank God his wife and his sister got him to look in the mirror. He dresses much better these days. Levin and Bruford command the rhythm, in much the same powerful and protean way that, say, Maria Callas commanded an operatic score: no quarter asked or given. The four of them were like that. Fripp and Belew are the absolute best paired guitarists ever, and they so thoroughly compliment each other that hearing either of them solo compells you to think of the other.The material had its highs and lows, and they are clearly on evidence here. But do yourself a favour. If you enjoy these shows, go to DGM's website and order ABSENT LOVERS. You will be in for one of the most rewarding nights of music in your life. Fripp talks often of MUSIC leaning over and taking one into its confidence. There are flashes of that in these two shows, it positively infuses every moment of the Montreal show.",4,An Essential Document,1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,2527,"['Make', 'mistake', 'line', 'Crimson', 'went', 'where', 'one', 'went', 'music', 'double', 'trio', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'successes', 'failures', 'band', 'two', 'concerts', 'show', 'redeeming', 'failures', 'considerably', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'Bruford', 'departure', 'double', 'trio', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'King', 'next', 'course', 'action', 'active', 'creative', 'input', 'absence', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'still', 'haunting', 'Crimson', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Levin', 'returned', 'stick', 'only', 'make', 'conspicuous', 'Bruford', 'absence', 'Mastelloto', 'not', 'simple', 'fate.As', 'here', 'though', 'shows', 'absolute', 'categorical', 'triumph', 'ABSENT', 'LOVERS', 'double', 'CD', 'last', 'show', 'Montreal', 'matter', 'present', 'King', 'full', 'roar', 'Spanish', 'film', 'Frejus', 'suffers', 'less', 'wonderful', 'sound', 'DGM', 'team', 'performed', 'miracle', 'getting', 'sound', 'as', 'good', 'Japan', 'show', 'hampered', 'absolutely', 'silly', 'video', 'tricks', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'amateurish', 'especially', 'when', 'stacked', 'compilation', 'Tony', 'Levin', 'home', 'movies', 'photos', 'Japan', 'show', 'have', 'tremendously', 'enhanced', 'audio', 'component', 'KC', 'was', 'never', 'much', 'visula', 'treat', 'fact', 'are', 'often', 'humourously', 'casting', 'aspersions', 'most', 'pyro', 'other', 'technics', 'such', 'case', 'here', 'are', 'offered', 'two', 'concerts', 'Belew', 'various', 'styles', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'pajamas', 'Fripp', 'so', 'desperately', 'girls', 'like', 'Crimson', 'hmmm', 'Fripp', 'black', 'tux', 'white', 'dinner', 'jacket', 'God', 'bless', 'singlehandedly', 'English', 'dweeb', 'planet', 'Thank', 'God', 'wife', 'sister', 'got', 'look', 'mirror', 'much', 'better', 'days', 'Levin', 'Bruford', 'command', 'rhythm', 'much', 'same', 'powerful', 'protean', 'way', 'say', 'Maria', 'Callas', 'commanded', 'operatic', 'score', 'quarter', 'asked', 'given', 'four', 'were', 'Fripp', 'Belew', 'are', 'absolute', 'best', 'paired', 'guitarists', 'ever', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'compliment', 'other', 'hearing', 'solo', 'compells', 'think', 'other.The', 'material', 'had', 'highs', 'lows', 'are', 'clearly', 'evidence', 'here', 'do', 'favour', 'enjoy', 'shows', 'go', 'DGM', 'website', 'order', 'ABSENT', 'LOVERS', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'rewarding', 'nights', 'music', 'life', 'Fripp', 'talks', 'often', 'MUSIC', 'leaning', 'taking', 'one', 'confidence', 'are', 'flashes', 'two', 'shows', 'positively', 'moment', 'Montreal', 'show']",N/A

These guys were full of invention and taste.  Robert Fripp (guitar) continued to steward the band into new, highly progressive territory and continued to bring his significant skills in composition to the table.  Adrian Belew (guitar, vocals) was in his prime, like a mature Jimi Hendrix, a master player and an engaging frontman.  Tony Levin (bass & stick) contributed perfectly tasteful bass parts and Bill Bruford (drums & percussion) was at his absolute best during this era, when he was experimenting with electronic drums.  Bruford's parts are constantly tasty and add an element of anarchy and excitement to this intricate music.""The Noise"" from 1982 is a great filmed performance that shows the band at their best.  The 1984 performance is crisper and contains more material, and is great also.The music mixes sonic experimentation ala Hendrix in his prime with a framework influenced by African & Asian music as well as 20th Century minimalism (Glass, Reich).

845003,A1A3485UTN4SS,B0002TT0GO,The Delite Rancher,"[11, 12]","For many, the 1980's were the dark ages of popular music. For example, in 1982, Olivia Newton-John,'s 'Let's Get Physical' was the number one song of the year. In 1984, Prince's 'When Doves Cry' was at the top of the charts. Beyond 'keeping the torch lit' during such years, King Crimson kept it raging for high-minded progressive rock. This DVD is a video testament to such power. During such moments, they may look as cheesy as ""Men at Work"" or ""Duran Duran,"" with their clothes, guitars and electric drums. But make no mistake, this was one of the premium King Crimson line-ups. During ""the Beat"" and ""Indiscipline"" time periods, Adrian Belew, Robert Fripp, Tony Levin and Bill Bruford were a combination of virtuosity and good timing. Indeed, the world would never again see such a synchronicity of song writing, vocals, instrumental brilliance, chemistry and flat-out creativity. The sound is futuristic by today's standards. This music would eventually lay the foundation for the up and coming jamband revolution. Les Claypool solidified this sentiment when he made 'Thela Hun Ginjeet' a staple of his live shows.
