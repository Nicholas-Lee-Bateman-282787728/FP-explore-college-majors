So, don't refrain from purchasing.  But the real mystery to me is Bob's closet.  Yeah, I know the romance between Howard and Ellen drags a bit (How anyone could become erotically attached to Howard is beyond me.), but that's the way it goes.  The question of the closet, however, is: Where does Bob put all those goofy clothes.  Yep, every episode he sports a new, garish outfit.  Yet, his closet is always half empty.  Does Bob maintain some kind of Harry Potter expanding closet device or does some clothing  company dress him on the elevator on the way up to his office each day?  Perhaps some companies that sell clothing to folks who believe they are financially successful would do that for credits at the end of the show.

999009,AWLFVCT9128JV,B000G6BL7O,"Dave_42 ""Dave_42""","[63, 63]","The fourth season (1975-1976) of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" is right up there with the second season, and perhaps even a bit better.  Some of the funniest episodes from the fan polls are from this season, and while there are perhaps a few fewer recognizable faces as guest stars, you will still see a few.  The writers and cast by this point have both hit their stride, and the chemistry is phenomenal.The Season is book-ended by appearances by Tom Poston as The Peeper, Bob's college buddy whom Emily can't stand.  Of course, Tom would go on to be a regular in Bob's next sitcom ""Newhart"", and then there is the irony that Tom and Suzanne Pleshette would eventually get married.  In-between, there are many events, including the death of Mr. Gianelli (""Death of a Fruitman""), Carol gets married (""Carol's Wedding""), Bob hosts an arrogant French psychologist (""Shrinks Across The Sea""), Bob forms a short-lived partnership with another psychiatrist (""Seemed Like a Good Idea At the Time"") and many more.Two of the funniest episodes ever are in this season with ""Who Is Mr. X?"", where Bob is ambushed by a morning talk-show host and is so flustered he reveals that one of his patients is a public servant.  The other classic is ""Over the River and Through the Woods"", in which Bob gets out of a trip to Seattle over Thanksgiving by claiming that his patients need him.  He ends up hosting a party with Jerry, Howard, and Mr. Carlin in which they all drink too much watching William and Mary's worst college football defeat, and make the funniest call for Chinese food ever recorded.  I also very much like ""Bob Has To Have His Tonsils Out, So He Spends Christmas Eve In The Hospital"", and the title explains the plot to that one.All in all, there are 24 episodes on three 2-sided DVDs, just the same as the first three seasons.  Also like seasons 2 and 3, there are five episodes with commentary, but I have to say that the commentary has improved this season; perhaps because they have more people participating in them.  I would still not call them great commentaries, but they are significantly better than the prior seasons.  There is a short season 4 feature, and there is also a gag reel.  In all, this is probably the best set of features they have included, but more importantly this is the season with the funniest episodes.",5,Perhaps The Best,1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,2328,"['fourth', 'season', '1975-1976', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'right', 'there', 'second', 'season', 'perhaps', 'even', 'bit', 'better', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'fan', 'polls', 'are', 'season', 'are', 'perhaps', 'few', 'fewer', 'recognizable', 'as', 'guest', 'stars', 'will', 'still', 'see', 'few', 'writers', 'cast', 'point', 'have', 'hit', 'stride', 'chemistry', 'phenomenal.The', 'Season', 'book-ended', 'appearances', 'Tom', 'Poston', 'Peeper', 'Bob', 'college', 'buddy', 'whom', 'Emily', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'course', 'Tom', 'would', 'go', 'be', 'regular', 'Bob', 'next', 'sitcom', 'Newhart', 'then', 'irony', 'Tom', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'would', 'eventually', 'get', 'married', 'In-between', 'are', 'many', 'events', 'including', 'death', 'Mr.', 'Gianelli', 'Death', 'Fruitman', 'Carol', 'married', 'Carol', 'Wedding', 'Bob', 'arrogant', 'French', 'psychologist', 'Shrinks', 'Sea', 'Bob', 'short-lived', 'partnership', 'psychiatrist', 'Seemed', 'Good', 'Idea', 'Time', 'many', 'more.Two', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'ever', 'are', 'season', 'Who', 'Mr', 'X', 'where', 'Bob', 'ambushed', 'morning', 'talk-show', 'host', 'so', 'flustered', 'one', 'patients', 'public', 'servant', 'other', 'classic', 'River', 'Woods', 'Bob', 'trip', 'Seattle', 'Thanksgiving', 'claiming', 'patients', 'need', 'up', 'hosting', 'party', 'Jerry', 'Howard', 'Mr.', 'Carlin', 'drink', 'too', 'much', 'watching', 'William', 'Mary', 'worst', 'college', 'football', 'defeat', 'make', 'funniest', 'call', 'Chinese', 'food', 'ever', 'recorded', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'Bob', 'Has', 'Have', 'Tonsils', 'Out', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Hospital', 'title', 'plot', 'one.All', 'are', '24', 'episodes', 'three', '2-sided', 'DVDs', 'just', 'same', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'Also', 'seasons', '2', '3', 'are', 'five', 'episodes', 'commentary', 'have', 'say', 'commentary', 'improved', 'season', 'perhaps', 'have', 'more', 'people', 'participating', 'would', 'still', 'not', 'call', 'great', 'commentaries', 'are', 'significantly', 'better', 'prior', 'seasons', 'short', 'season', '4', 'feature', 'also', 'gag', 'reel', 'probably', 'best', 'set', 'features', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'importantly', 'season', 'funniest', 'episodes']",The Bob Newhart Show: The Complete Fourth Season

Mechlinski,"[1, 1]","I'm rewatching all the Bob Newhart Show seasons (watched them as they originally ran on TV before) as I find this comedy series to be completely refreshing, funny and very entertaining. It's as great a series today as it was originally years ago. As a matter of fact, it's a reminder of what television today lacks - good, honest, friendly comedy. Each episode tackles situations that can be as realistic today as they were years back. The characters are hilarious - from Bob's co-workers Jerry, Carol, his neighbor Howard, his sister, his group patients and his wife, Emily -- everyone in their own way has a unique kind of humor that when they're all put together, you know you've got the blend for an exceptional comedy series. They work so well together; each character is loveable in their own unique way. And nobody is even trying too hard to be funny! The humor comes out to appear quite natural - especially Bob! I highly recommend this series - whether you're refreshing your memory from having seen it back in the 70s or are new to the show. Get ready to laugh out loud during each episode.

999021,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B000G6BL7O,mrliteral,"[18, 18]","It's hard to not lump the Mary Tyler Moore Show and Bob Newhart Show together. For years, they ran together in prime time, they both ended while still good (and before the ratings really dropped) and even in syndication (like when I was first exposed to these shows), they tended to run one right after the other.  The Mary Tyler Moore Show won all the awards and has always been regarded as one of the best TV comedies ever.  As much as I enjoy it, however, I have always enjoyed the Bob Newhart Show even more.The centerpiece of the show is, of course, Bob Newhart, playing psychologist Bob Hartley.  Newhart is a gifted comedian and is a master of timing and delivery.  Even though he is often the straight man compared to others, he still gets in his share of jokes.  Suzanne Pleshette plays his wife Emily, a school teacher who is just as smart as Bob; in fact, in an earlier season, he had to deal with her higher IQ.  Bill Daily is the daffy neighbor Howard Borden (he's probably perpetually dazed from jet lag from his job as a navigator).  Finally, there are Bob's workplace friends:  the dentist Jerry Robinson (Peter Bonerz) and receptionist Carol Kester (Marcia Wallace, probably better known nowadays as the voice of Mrs. Krabappel in the Simpsons).The strength of the show is that it is so character-driven.  No one fits completely into a stereotypical mold.  Jerry's faade as a free-wheeling bachelor actually conceals a rather lonely life.  Howard, for all his oddness, still is concerned about his son who he rarely sees.  In the fourth season, however, it is Carol who undergoes the most change, as she tries to pursue other career options and becomes married after a whirlwind romance.The 24 episodes of this season are bookended by appearances by Bob's old college buddy, the Peeper (Tom Poston).  In the show, Emily is not fond of the Peeper's prankish humor, but in real life, Pleshette and Poston would eventually marry (as discussed in the commentary for the first episode).  In between are a number of other great episodes, probably highlighted by Over the River and Through the Woods, where Bob gets really drunk when left alone for Thanksgiving.  In Who is Mr. X?, Bob winds up being ambushed during a TV interview; according to the commentary, this episode wound up being shown at various businesses as a cautionary tale.These episodes ran in the 1975-6 season.  It is interesting to see how programming worked thirty years ago.  New episodes ran every week from September through February with only a single break for Christmas.  It's quite a contrast to the current strategy of stretching a season over eight months and rarely showing more than four new episodes in a row.  Of course, even better is owning the whole season on DVD; you don't even have to wait a week between shows.  While the fashions may be a bit out-of-date, the show itself isn't and it remains better than most sitcoms are nowadays.  If you have never seen the Bob Newhart Show, you are in for a treat.",5,An underrated classic,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,3003,"['hard', 'not', 'lump', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'together', 'years', 'ran', 'together', 'prime', 'time', 'ended', 'still', 'good', 'ratings', 'really', 'dropped', 'even', 'syndication', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'exposed', 'shows', 'tended', 'run', 'one', 'right', 'other', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'won', 'awards', 'always', 'been', 'regarded', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'comedies', 'ever', 'As', 'much', 'enjoy', 'however', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'even', 'more.The', 'centerpiece', 'show', 'course', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'playing', 'psychologist', 'Bob', 'Hartley', 'Newhart', 'gifted', 'comedian', 'master', 'timing', 'delivery', 'Even', 'often', 'straight', 'man', 'compared', 'others', 'still', 'share', 'jokes', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'wife', 'Emily', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'smart', 'Bob', 'fact', 'earlier', 'season', 'had', 'deal', 'higher', 'IQ', 'Bill', 'Daily', 'daffy', 'neighbor', 'Howard', 'Borden', 'probably', 'perpetually', 'dazed', 'jet', 'lag', 'job', 'navigator', 'Finally', 'are', 'Bob', 'workplace', 'friends', 'dentist', 'Jerry', 'Robinson', 'Peter', 'Bonerz', 'receptionist', 'Carol', 'Kester', 'Marcia', 'Wallace', 'probably', 'better', 'known', 'nowadays', 'voice', 'Mrs.', 'Krabappel', 'Simpsons', '.The', 'strength', 'show', 'so', 'character-driven', 'one', 'completely', 'stereotypical', 'mold', 'Jerry', 'faade', 'free-wheeling', 'bachelor', 'actually', 'rather', 'lonely', 'life', 'Howard', 'oddness', 'still', 'concerned', 'son', 'who', 'rarely', 'fourth', 'season', 'however', 'Carol', 'who', 'undergoes', 'most', 'change', 'pursue', 'other', 'career', 'options', 'becomes', 'married', 'whirlwind', 'romance.The', '24', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'bookended', 'appearances', 'Bob', 'old', 'college', 'buddy', 'Peeper', 'Tom', 'Poston', 'show', 'Emily', 'not', 'fond', 'Peeper', 'prankish', 'humor', 'real', 'life', 'Pleshette', 'Poston', 'would', 'eventually', 'marry', 'discussed', 'commentary', 'first', 'episode', 'are', 'number', 'other', 'great', 'episodes', 'probably', 'highlighted', 'River', 'Woods', 'where', 'Bob', 'really', 'drunk', 'when', 'left', 'alone', 'Thanksgiving', 'Who', 'Mr', 'X', 'Bob', 'up', 'being', 'ambushed', 'TV', 'interview', 'according', 'commentary', 'episode', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'shown', 'various', 'businesses', 'cautionary', 'tale.These', 'episodes', 'ran', '1975-6', 'season', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'programming', 'worked', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'New', 'episodes', 'ran', 'week', 'September', 'February', 'only', 'single', 'break', 'Christmas', 'quite', 'contrast', 'current', 'strategy', 'stretching', 'season', 'eight', 'months', 'rarely', 'showing', 'more', 'four', 'new', 'episodes', 'row', 'course', 'even', 'better', 'owning', 'whole', 'season', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'wait', 'week', 'shows', 'fashions', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'out-of-date', 'show', ""n't"", 'better', 'most', 'sitcoms', 'are', 'nowadays', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'are', 'treat']",The Bob Newhart Show: The Complete Fourth Season

All of the jokes here are slow and ponderous, and the set-ups for the jokes are predictable and very cliche.  While the show was very strong for the first three seasons, this season is simply hard to watch--it makes me cringe to see how un-funny some of the jokes and situations are.  Too many of them depend upon unrealistic reactions by others, or on someone walking in the door at an inopportune moment, or on conflicts that force characters to step out of character.  Just watch the painfully embarrassing (and not at all funny) restaurant scene in episode two, and you'll see the season in a nutshell.  All in all, there has been little to enjoy this season.Bob Newhart's genius is based in a great part on his subtlety, on his understatement.  Yet there's very little of that here--these all look like pilot episodes with undeveloped characters trying desperately to get laughs with weak material.  There are a few moments of true humor, but very few.As a side note, who's responsible for the absolutely awful artwork on the disc menus?
