At the point this  film was released, he'd mostly starred in British television, the sole exception being the vastly underrated filmCroupier.  Shortly after 'Greenfingers' cameGosford Parkand, more importantly,Closer (Superbit Edition)in which he blew Jude Law and Julia Roberts off the screen.  Now he's Clive Owen, International Superstar, the kind of actor that makes my wife audibly gasp when he appears on screen (Bardem is the only other guy in this category).So, from that perspective, it's interesting to watch a movie made in 1999 - 2000 and see Owen putting in a workmanlike performance.  I like the chemistry between him and David Kelly (ofWaking Ned Devinefame) as well as the paternal stewardship shown by Warren Clarke as the warden, who I enjoyed immensely in the underrated, mis-marketedBlow Dry.",4,"Before he was Clive Owen, International Superstar, there was Greenfingers",1201305600,"01 26, 2008",2008,945,"[""'Greenfingers"", 'winning', 'little', 'film', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'was', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'international', 'audiences', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'released', ""'d"", 'mostly', 'starred', 'British', 'television', 'sole', 'exception', 'being', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'filmCroupier', 'Shortly', ""'Greenfingers"", 'cameGosford', 'Parkand', 'more', 'importantly', 'Closer', 'Superbit', 'Edition', 'blew', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'screen', 'Now', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'International', 'Superstar', 'kind', 'actor', 'wife', 'audibly', 'gasp', 'when', 'screen', 'Bardem', 'only', 'other', 'guy', 'category', '.So', 'perspective', 'interesting', 'watch', 'movie', 'made', '1999', '2000', 'see', 'Owen', 'putting', 'workmanlike', 'performance', 'chemistry', 'David', 'Kelly', 'ofWaking', 'Ned', 'Devinefame', 'as', 'well', 'paternal', 'stewardship', 'shown', 'Warren', 'Clarke', 'warden', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'underrated', 'mis-marketedBlow', 'Dry']",N/A

Joel Hershman has created a real gem on a relatively tiny budget - $3 million - but there are no corners cut anywhere. The actors are beautifully cast, and create an entertaining ensemble effort. Clive Owen is, as all breathing females will soon attest, delicious to watch and David Kelly has all the frailty and humor that we saw in him in WAKING NED DEVINE. I am not generally a fan of Helen Mirren, but she was ideally cast here as a proper gardening British lady of a certain age. I was particularly impressed by Mr. Hershman's screenwriting for this movie - very compact, very funny and on a number of occasions very touching without being maudlin.

He shows quite a range too judging from the blend of comedy and drama he brings to this role and then outright drama in ""Croupier.""  Owen is a murderer who is serving out what looks like a lifetime prison sentence. However, he is selected as a trial prisoner at a rehab facility that's purpose is to give him employable skills. There he finds the passion of his life: gardening.  He also finds an older prisoner as his first and only friend in life, soon to be followed by other prisoners he lets into his gardening circle plus the warden himself.  Gardening in the UK is considered quite an art form in and of itself, unlike the way it is considered in the USA, and that is the way this film deals with it.  Helen Mirren plays the grand dame of UK gardening wonderfully, sort of a Barbara Cartland, Martha Stewart and Julia Child, all rolled as one into the UK gardening world.  Owen becomes romantically attached to her daughter.  This is a very charming movie that works on many levels.

Case in point:  GREENFINGERS.  Less than half the critics on Rotten Tomatoes gave it a favorable rating, but Amazon & netflix reviewers give it 4  stars.  Apparently we appreciate its typically British understatement, mild humor, and a story which may be slight of plot but which doesn't slight its characters.  (Hmmm...these are qualities which fans of LOST IN TRANSLATION claim to find in that movie.  Perhaps if GREENFINGERS' director were named Coppola instead of Hershman, then he would be up for an Oscar, along with Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, and the rest of the cast and crew.)If you liked WAKING NED DEVINE or LOCAL HERO or any of a number of small, well-crafted British films about the character of ordinary people, you will probably enjoy this movie.  It lacks gratuitous nudity, violence and profanity, graphic sex, special effects wizardry, and cheap shots at other cultures, but these omissions just make it better.  The film is technically as self-effacing as the performances - - all in the service of story, rather than for calling attention to the makers' cleverness, or hipness, or at least what masquerades as such among the unenlightened.This is a movie about growth and transformation, not about stasis.  It is about people with the character to make the most of their situation in life, no matter how apparently bleak.  It is about the heroism of daily struggle to find meaning and value in the small things of everyday life, about simple faith, about making a difference, about love, forgiveness, and redemption, and ultimately about what it is to be human.

Without getting into the plot, a number of the prisoners charged with various levels of crimes, find themselves involved in a gardening project that eventually leads to an opportunity to leave the prison on a ""work release"" program to do more gardening.  Gardens in England are extremely  popular but one would not expect that some of the best gardeners would emerge from the prison system. Of course, some in the system are against the prisoners going off grounds to work even though it may seem to be a rehabilitative project.

Because Colin refuses to choose a vocation, he is put to unsavory tasks, whereby an elderly fellow advises him to become a gardener, because at least he can be outdoors.To his surprise, he not only has a knack for gardening, he really enjoys it. A local much-celebrated doyenne of gardening, played by Helen Mirren (""The Queen"" and ""Prime Suspect"") needs extra help for a TV special, so she borrows a crew from the nearby prison. The upshot is that after she becomes acquainted with Owen and his uncommon skills, the prison is entered into competition for England's most-prestigious garden show award.Bingo!

680545,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005RYKX,Reviewer,"[13, 13]","According to the old saying there are only two sure things in life:  Death and taxes; and while that's all very pithy and emboldening in a way that suggests machismo with a John Wayne swagger, it isn't entirely accurate.  Because if there is one constant in life, it's the fact that everyone makes mistakes, and moreover, that if given the chance most will at least attempt to set to rights whatever bitter pill has been wrought by their personal indiscretions and miscalculations, whether felony or misdemeanor.  Which is precisely what writer/director Joel Hershman considers in ""Greenfingers,"" a comedy/drama that seeks out the good in the bad while making a statement about the redemption afforded by the proverbial ""Second Chance.""  Like the amazing gardens at the center of this story, and in which Hershman's metaphor can be found, this film is about the cycle of life; about death and rebirth and hope.  It's a story based on actual events, told by Hershman with warm good humor and in a way that reaches out to the humanity in us all, offered for the contemplation of his audience with an eye upon a world that is in all ways a bit brighter and better.In his youth, Colin Briggs (Clive Owen) made a mistake; and he's spent fifteen years doing hard time in prison because of it, with no indication that he'll be getting out any time soon, if ever.  But the powers that be have decided he's a perfect candidate for an experimental ""open prison,"" program, an environment without walls that will afford even ""lifers"" an opportunity for parole if they can make good at it.  Initially, Colin is not keen on the idea, but he has no choice in the matter.  He's summarily transferred, and once in his new digs he is befriended by Fergus Wilks (David Kelly), an old man who will pay for his crimes until the end of his days, but who has a perspective on life that has a subtle effect on Colin's future.  It is Fergus who gives Colin a small gift that ultimately turns his life around-- a small packet of flower seeds which Colin proceeds to plant in an unlikely place in the dead of winter with no hope that anything will ever come of it.  Colin, however, is about to discover one of the mysteries of life; that in a seed-- any kind of seed planted anywhere in the world-- there is the gift and promise of life.  And the following Spring presents Colin with another gift-- a surprise that is going to change his life forever.With this film, Hershman has crafted and delivered a story rooted in a subject that is essentially ""hard"" in nature, but he takes a positive, gentle approach to it that makes it entirely accessible and engaging.  It does, in fact, provide an eye-opening perspective to an area that many are prone to view with a closed mind.  Many (Roger Ebert among them) will claim that the characters portrayed here are predictable stereotypes, which on one hand is true; but on the other hand, stereotypes are often a reflection of reality, which is decidedly the case here, and moreover, Hershman successfully delves beneath that outer skin from which the label is derived to find the uniqueness that resides at the core of each of these individuals.  There are so-called ""stereotypical"" responses and reactions effected by some of the characters here, as well, but again, within the context of the story, they are no more than a reflection of what a like situation in real life would evoke.  In the final analysis, ""life"" is filled with stereotypes, and what is too often deemed ""predictable"" is more often than not a depiction of something that would be more accurately described as ""inevitable.""  All of which Hershman so eloquently conveys in his film.Though they would never admit it even to themselves, ""professional"" critics with one too many reviews under their substantial belts are often too jaded to appreciate the nuances of a film like this and take the easy way out, seeing only what they ""choose"" to see, and unfortunately it is that dismissive attitude that finds it's way into their comments; one even went so far as to say in print that what amounted to his ""subjective"" opinion was to be taken as the definitive view, inasmuch as he is ""paid to know these things.""  And it is that attitude that diminishes the credibility of the ""professional"" critic, and in the end often renders what they do a disservice to the filmmaker and the audience alike, which is the case in point here.  And it points up the necessity of seeing and judging for yourself; do not be dissuaded from a good thing by ramblings touted as ""educated"" under the banner of a byline, beneath which lies a personal agenda that often supersedes any and all objectivity.Under Hershman's steady hand the story comes to life through a number of solid performances, most notably Owen, who successfully captures the stoic resolve and acceptance of a man who has paid, and continues to pay, for the single misstep of his life.  And it's that reserved countenance more than anything else that makes Owen's portrayal so convincing, that sense that he sees his glass as half full and half empty at the same time; a kind of hopeful/hopeless attitude that is entirely believable for a man in his situation.The standout performance, however, is turned in by Helen Mirren, as Georgina Woodhouse, a kind of ""Martha Stewart"" of gardening in England.  She lends some true blue ""character"" to her character and adds a bit of spunk and attitude that makes Georgina entirely believable.  In a wide-brimmed hat and colorful attire that reflects the beauty of her beloved gardens, she is absolutely radiant.  And when you factor in the performances of David Kelly, Warren Clarke and Natasha Little, it makes ""Greenfingers"" a film not only to be seen, but embraced.",4,"Hershman Brings Some Insight to a

680546,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B00005RYKX,Serene Night,"[6, 6]","Greenfingers is the story of Colin, a convict in the British prison system. Colin, who has been in prison for over ten years, is a model prisoner. When he is eligible for bail he is sent to a `work camp' style prison (Edgefield), where he is supposed to learn a trade.Not caring about his fate, Colin isn't particularly choosy about which trade he learns and ends up in Maintenance. Eventually, inspired by his elderly roommate, Colin learns to garden. Through gardening, he finds a way to put the past behind him and heal himself and others by growing wonderful plants and contributing to the community. Inspired by Colin's success a new work furlow program is initiated. . Through the program Colin makes new friends, a new love interest, and helps the men learn new skills. When a valuable art artifact is stolen from the work site, Colin and the convicts are blamed. Can Colin overcome his trouble to prove that Gardening has been helpful in rehabilitating the inmates of Edgefield?Although this movie was billed as a comedy, its not, really. I'd call it more of an `inspirational' movie of the sleepy `driving Miss Daisy' variety. Colin is a likeable character with a checkered past. The fulfillment he finds gardening is quite entertaining. The other convicts are well portrayed and believable. I recommend Greenfingers for those who are looking for an inspirational movie everyone will enjoy.

Clive Owens does a good job of portraying a man imprisoned since he was 18 years old for murder, who ultimately is redeemed by discovering that he can foster life in the garden.  At times Owens is too cold and distant--his portrayal would have been better if he had brought a little more variation in his emotional state.The supporting cast of British character actors do a nice job and are charming and sympathetic.  Mirren plays the English matriarch with aplomb but overdoes it a little--just like the screen play which tries a little too hard to be cute at times.  The major problem with the movie was a poor soundtrack--it was not well matched with the emotional content of the scenes.This was a movie that had a lot of potential that did not quite become fulfilled.",3,"Enjoyable, but tries a little too hard to be cute!",1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,827,"['Greenfingers', 'story', 'redemption', 'horticulture', 'Clive', 'Owens', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'man', 'imprisoned', 'was', '18', 'years', 'old', 'murder', 'who', 'ultimately', 'redeemed', 'discovering', 'can', 'foster', 'life', 'garden', 'times', 'Owens', 'too', 'cold', 'distant', 'portrayal', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'brought', 'little', 'more', 'variation', 'emotional', 'state.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'British', 'character', 'actors', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'are', 'charming', 'sympathetic', 'Mirren', 'English', 'matriarch', 'aplomb', 'little', 'just', 'screen', 'play', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'cute', 'times', 'major', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'poor', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'matched', 'emotional', 'content', 'scenes.This', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'become', 'fulfilled']",N/A

Despite lukewarm critical reviews, a large crowd was at the screening, and we all seemed to enjoy it.Greenfingers is funny, moving, and very well acted. Clive Owen gives a magnetic performance as a prisoner who becomes fascinated by gardening, and Hellen Mirren is great as the overbearing English grand dame of gardening. The jokes are wonderful, and the story of people trying to turn their lives around against difficult odds is quite touching.Those who equate sophistication with violence or cynicism will dislike Greenfingers, but if you liked the Full Monty and Billy Elliott, you'll probably enjoy this charming British film too.R-rated films come in many degrees of violence, profanity, sexual explicitness, and so on.

Good behavior allows him to be placed in a honor program where he discovers gardening, thanks to his elderly and frail cellmate Fergus (David Kelly).
