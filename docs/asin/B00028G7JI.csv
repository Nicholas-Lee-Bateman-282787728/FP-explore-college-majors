827118,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00028G7JI,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 1]","In a May 2009 review of a Hank Williams tribute album, ""Timeless"" , released in  2003 (the 50th Anniversary of his death) I noted the following that is germane to a review of this very informative and balanced PBS ""American Masters"" production of the life and times of one of the legends of  American roots music -country and western branch (and maybe more):""A musical performer knows that he or she has arrived when they have accumulated enough laurels and created enough songs to be worthy, at least in some record producer's eyes, of a tribute album. When they are also alive to accept the accolades as two out of the four of the artists under review are, which in these cases is only proper, that is all to the good. That said, not all tribute albums are created equally. Some are full of star-studded covers, others are filled with lesser lights that have been influenced by the artist that they are paying tribute to. As a general proposition though I find it a fairly rare occurrence, as I have noted in a review of the ""Timeless"" tribute album to Hank Williams, that the cover artist outdoes the work of the original recording artist. With that point in mind I will give my ""skinny"" on the cover artists here.""And that is the essential point that separates the musical greats like Hank Williams from the transitory stars of the day. Over fifty years after his death his songs, heartfelt, tragic, depressive, and on a few occasions whimsical still ""speak"" to musicians and modern listeners alike.  His life`s story, as told here through commentary by those who knew and worked with him, including various members of his ""Drifting Cowboys"" back-up bands, his widow, his son and grandson Hank II and III respectively, his stepdaughter and various other hometown folks (Montgomery, Alabama although I swear he is a Cajun boy), musical collaborators and music historians unrolls very much like a... Hank Williams ballad. And that again is the point-here is a case where life and art are not so very far apart.Since the music is what is eternal in this troubled man's life let me finish up here with a reposting of that ""Timeless"" tribute album review mentioned above. It is that simple yet profound music that gives the essence of the man, his seemingly eternal marriage troubles (and some joys too, I think), his losing battle against drugs and alcohol and his search back for the happier days of his poor boy roots in Alabama after fame and fortune proved too narrow to satisfy whatever was eating at him inside.""To The Original Honk-Tonk ManTimeless; A 50th Anniversary Tribute to Hank Williams, various artists, UMG Recordings, 2001In a review of a Hank Williams anthology in this space (""Gold"", a two disc CD of most of the best known songs) noted that I have been listening to a local weekend folk, rock and contemporary music interview show here in Boston for years. The format of the show is to interview, in depth, contemporary well-known singers, songwriters and musicians as well as young unknowns looking to make their mark. One of the questions always asked of each interviewee is about formative influences on their musical development. Although I do not believe that I have ever heard what I would consider a country singer interviewed on the show the name Hank Williams has come up many more times than any other from young and old interviewees alike. That tells the tale of the importance of this man's work, beyond the obvious country influence.Here some of those well-known musicians mentioned above pay tribute to Hank's influence by covering his songs for a 50th Anniversary of his death edition. A strange occasion for a tribute one might say, although no so for the fast-living, hard-driving, hard drinking Mr. Williams. The likes of Bob Dylan (a subject of many tribute covers himself) on a rocking "" Can't Get You Off Of My Mind"", Johnnie Cash reciting (recital or maybe, better, talking blues being a Williams speciality) the tearful ""I Dreamed About Mama Last Night""  and Beck on the mournful ""You're Cheatin' Heart"" do his memory honor with their own interpretations. I would note, however that, unlike a number of other artists such as the above-noted Dylan, that cover versions of Hank's songs do not usually measure up to the verve and imprint on the mind of his original renditions. The great exception here is Lucinda Williams (no relation, as far as I know) whose rendition of ""Cold, Cold Heart"" captured all the pathos, and more, of that tune. So long, one more time, Honky-Tonk Man. Listen on.""And watch this documentary.",5,To The Honky Tonk Man,1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,4560,"['May', '2009', 'review', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'tribute', 'album', 'Timeless', 'released', '2003', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'death', 'noted', 'following', 'germane', 'review', 'very', 'informative', 'balanced', 'PBS', 'American', 'Masters', 'production', 'life', 'times', 'one', 'legends', 'American', 'roots', 'music', '-country', 'western', 'branch', 'maybe', 'more', 'musical', 'performer', 'arrived', 'when', 'have', 'accumulated', 'enough', 'laurels', 'created', 'enough', 'songs', 'be', 'worthy', 'least', 'record', 'producer', 'eyes', 'tribute', 'album', 'When', 'are', 'also', 'alive', 'accept', 'accolades', 'two', 'four', 'artists', 'review', 'are', 'cases', 'only', 'proper', 'good', 'said', 'not', 'tribute', 'albums', 'are', 'created', 'equally', 'are', 'full', 'star-studded', 'covers', 'others', 'are', 'filled', 'lesser', 'lights', 'have', 'been', 'influenced', 'artist', 'are', 'paying', 'tribute', 'general', 'proposition', 'find', 'fairly', 'rare', 'occurrence', 'have', 'noted', 'review', 'Timeless', 'tribute', 'album', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'cover', 'artist', 'work', 'original', 'recording', 'artist', 'point', 'mind', 'will', 'give', 'skinny', 'cover', 'here', 'essential', 'point', 'musical', 'greats', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'transitory', 'stars', 'day', 'fifty', 'years', 'death', 'songs', 'heartfelt', 'tragic', 'depressive', 'few', 'occasions', 'whimsical', 'still', 'speak', 'musicians', 'modern', 'listeners', 'alike', 'life', 's', 'story', 'told', 'here', 'commentary', 'who', 'knew', 'worked', 'including', 'various', 'members', 'Drifting', 'Cowboys', 'back-up', 'bands', 'widow', 'son', 'grandson', 'Hank', 'II', 'III', 'respectively', 'stepdaughter', 'various', 'other', 'hometown', 'folks', 'Montgomery', 'Alabama', 'swear', 'Cajun', 'boy', 'musical', 'collaborators', 'music', 'historians', 'unrolls', 'very', 'much', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'ballad', 'again', 'point-here', 'case', 'where', 'life', 'art', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'very', 'far', 'apart.Since', 'music', 'what', 'eternal', 'troubled', 'man', 'life', 'let', 'finish', 'up', 'here', 'reposting', 'Timeless', 'tribute', 'album', 'review', 'mentioned', 'simple', 'yet', 'profound', 'music', 'essence', 'man', 'seemingly', 'eternal', 'marriage', 'troubles', 'joys', 'too', 'think', 'losing', 'battle', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'search', 'back', 'happier', 'days', 'poor', 'boy', 'roots', 'Alabama', 'fame', 'fortune', 'proved', 'too', 'narrow', 'satisfy', 'was', 'eating', 'inside', 'Original', 'Honk-Tonk', 'ManTimeless', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'Tribute', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'various', 'artists', 'UMG', 'Recordings', '2001In', 'review', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'anthology', 'space', 'Gold', 'two', 'disc', 'CD', 'most', 'best', 'known', 'songs', 'noted', 'have', 'been', 'listening', 'local', 'weekend', 'folk', 'rock', 'contemporary', 'music', 'interview', 'show', 'here', 'Boston', 'years', 'format', 'show', 'interview', 'depth', 'contemporary', 'well-known', 'singers', 'songwriters', 'musicians', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'unknowns', 'looking', 'make', 'mark', 'One', 'questions', 'always', 'asked', 'interviewee', 'formative', 'influences', 'musical', 'development', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'country', 'singer', 'interviewed', 'show', 'name', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'come', 'up', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'other', 'young', 'old', 'interviewees', 'alike', 'tale', 'importance', 'man', 'work', 'obvious', 'country', 'influence.Here', 'well-known', 'musicians', 'mentioned', 'pay', 'tribute', 'Hank', 'influence', 'covering', 'songs', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'death', 'edition', 'strange', 'occasion', 'tribute', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'so', 'fast-living', 'hard-driving', 'hard', 'drinking', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'likes', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'subject', 'many', 'tribute', 'covers', 'rocking', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Get', 'My', 'Mind', 'Johnnie', 'Cash', 'reciting', 'recital', 'maybe', 'better', 'talking', 'blues', 'being', 'Williams', 'speciality', 'tearful', 'Dreamed', 'Mama', 'Last', 'Night', 'Beck', 'mournful', ""'re"", 'Cheatin', 'Heart', 'do', 'memory', 'honor', 'own', 'interpretations', 'would', 'note', 'however', 'number', 'other', 'artists', 'such', 'above-noted', 'Dylan', 'cover', 'versions', 'Hank', 'songs', 'do', 'not', 'usually', 'measure', 'up', 'verve', 'imprint', 'mind', 'original', 'renditions', 'great', 'exception', 'here', 'Lucinda', 'Williams', 'relation', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'rendition', 'Cold', 'Cold', 'Heart', 'captured', 'pathos', 'more', 'tune', 'So', 'long', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'Honky-Tonk', 'Man', 'Listen', 'watch', 'documentary']",Hank Williams: Honky Tonk Blues

827120,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B00028G7JI,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[1, 1]","This is an excellent, VERY COMPREHENSIVE, DOCUMENTARY ,biography of the legendary country music/American music legend HANK WILLIAMS.  IT BEGINS WITH EXCELLLENT REPLICATION FOOTAGE OF HIS ""BABY BLUE"" 1952 CADILLAC DRIVING THROUGH THE COUNTRY SIDE. It covers his family background in rural south Alabama. It covers Hank's life from childhood all the way throughout his life, his career and even his death, and his funeral, and his legacy and events after his death. This contains excellent archival footage obtained from family members, performance footage, footage from friends, and other sources. It is very comprehensive.During most of the documentary, Hank's music is played in the background. The Dvd does contain some performance, and commentary footage of Hank, and some recordings of Hank's voice.It also contains commentaries and interviews by Hank Williams Jr., Lucretia (Hank's step daughter from his marriage with Miss Audrey), Hank Williams III, Jett Williams(Hank Sr's daughter), Members of his band the ""Drifting Cowboy's"", Billie Jean Horton (Hank Sr. was married to her when he died, the son of Rufus ""Tee-Tot"" Payne (""Tee-Tot"" is the black street musician who taught Hank Sr. how to play the guitar, and friends and fans. It also contains footage of his first and beloved wife ""Miss Audrey"". It even has footage of her performing some songs.One thing that stood out for me was an interview of one of his band members, ""the Drifting Cowboys"". He said when the 4 band members agreed to be Hank's band, that Hank took them over to a pawn shop, and requested 4 ""black jacks"" (also known as ""slap jacks""- they are a fighting device made of lead covered in black leather). Hank said ""If you're going to play with me, you'll need these, because when we get through playing, all the women in the audience will want to be with us, and that will make their men mad, and make them want to fight us. The ""Drifting Cowboy"" continued, saying that alot of their concerts ended in brawls. He said Hank even used his guitar as a weapon, and usually smashed one up every week in these concert ending brawls.It covers his success in Montgomery, which lead to him being invited to join the Louisiana Hayride Radio show in Shreveport, Louisiana (LA), that was held at the legendary Shreveport Municipal Auditorium. It covers his success on the ""Louisiana Hayride"", which included his #1 Hit ""Lovesick Blues"". While he was living in Shreveport, his son Randall Hank Jr. was born. This time he spent in Shreveport were some of the best years of his short life.The success of ""Lovesick Blues"" lead to an invitation to join the ""Grand Ole Orpy"" in Nashville, Tenn. His success there continued for quite sometime. He was a ""head-liner"" Act on many ""Grand Ole Opry"" Tours, and other tours. It covers the famous ""Hadacol"" Medicine Show Tour, which Hank headlined. It covers Hank in New York, with Tony Bennett when Tony Bennett recorded Hank's ""Your Cold Cold Heart"".During this time,  there was so much of Hank's music on the radio and on Juke boxes, that he came up with a ""ghost writer"" name of Luke the Drifter"". He released many songs under the name ""Luke the Drifter"".Finally, the pressure of all this sucess, and Hank's stuggle with his relationship with his wife Audrey, and his lifestyle, lead to him being fired from the ""Grand Ole Orpy"". (Johnny Cash was fired from the Opry also).He moved back to Louisiana, and re-joined the Louisiana Hayride Show, and remained employed there until his death.The Dvd recreate's his death night (Dec.31,1952/Jan.1,1953), where he was traveling from Montgomery to Canton, Ohio to do a New Years Day show. Using a ""baby Blue"" 1952 cadillac, it covers his journey,and even goes to the Knoxville Hotel where Hank checked into for a while. The same bus boy who served Hank that night is still alive and is interviewed in this Dvd. Also, the young man who drove Hank from Knoxville to the Hospital where he was pronounced dead is interviewed. Hank was living with Billie Jean at the time and was on a vacation from the Louisiana Hayride show, and was staying in Montgomery, AL. According to Billie Jean, the morning that Hank got up to make his final trip, he told her that ""Jesus was coming to get him today"". The dvd even has a replica of the Service Station in 1952 that his driver pulled into to seek help, and a recreation of this event. This is when they realize something is bad wrong.It's a very comphresive documentary dvd, and is very well presented. If you like Hank Williams or just a good documentary/biography of an American/Country Music legend, you'll enjoy this one, and therefore, I highly recommend it.",5,"Hank Williams ""Honky Tonk Blues"" DVD",1224720000,"10 23, 2008",2008,4649,"['excellent', 'VERY', 'COMPREHENSIVE', 'DOCUMENTARY', 'biography', 'legendary', 'country', 'music/American', 'music', 'legend', 'HANK', 'WILLIAMS', 'IT', 'BEGINS', 'WITH', 'EXCELLLENT', 'REPLICATION', 'FOOTAGE', 'HIS', 'BABY', 'BLUE', '1952', 'CADILLAC', 'DRIVING', 'THE', 'COUNTRY', 'SIDE', 'family', 'background', 'rural', 'south', 'Alabama', 'Hank', 'life', 'childhood', 'way', 'life', 'career', 'even', 'death', 'funeral', 'legacy', 'events', 'death', 'excellent', 'archival', 'footage', 'obtained', 'family', 'members', 'performance', 'footage', 'footage', 'friends', 'other', 'sources', 'very', 'comprehensive.During', 'most', 'documentary', 'Hank', 'music', 'played', 'background', 'Dvd', 'contain', 'performance', 'commentary', 'footage', 'Hank', 'recordings', 'Hank', 'voice.It', 'also', 'commentaries', 'interviews', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'Jr.', 'Lucretia', 'Hank', 'step', 'daughter', 'marriage', 'Miss', 'Audrey', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'III', 'Jett', 'Williams', 'Hank', 'Sr', 'daughter', 'Members', 'band', 'Drifting', 'Cowboy', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'Horton', 'Hank', 'Sr.', 'was', 'married', 'when', 'died', 'son', 'Rufus', 'Tee-Tot', 'Payne', 'Tee-Tot', 'black', 'street', 'musician', 'who', 'taught', 'Hank', 'Sr.', 'how', 'play', 'guitar', 'friends', 'fans', 'also', 'footage', 'first', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Miss', 'Audrey', 'even', 'footage', 'performing', 'songs.One', 'thing', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'interview', 'one', 'band', 'members', 'Drifting', 'Cowboys', 'said', 'when', '4', 'band', 'members', 'agreed', 'be', 'Hank', 'band', 'Hank', 'took', 'over', 'pawn', 'shop', 'requested', '4', 'black', 'jacks', 'also', 'known', 'slap', 'jacks', 'are', 'fighting', 'device', 'made', 'lead', 'covered', 'black', 'leather', 'Hank', 'said', ""'re"", 'going', 'play', ""'ll"", 'need', 'when', 'get', 'playing', 'women', 'audience', 'will', 'want', 'be', 'will', 'make', 'men', 'mad', 'make', 'want', 'fight', 'Drifting', 'Cowboy', 'continued', 'saying', 'alot', 'concerts', 'ended', 'brawls', 'said', 'Hank', 'even', 'used', 'guitar', 'weapon', 'usually', 'smashed', 'one', 'up', 'week', 'concert', 'ending', 'brawls.It', 'covers', 'success', 'Montgomery', 'lead', 'being', 'invited', 'join', 'Louisiana', 'Hayride', 'Radio', 'show', 'Shreveport', 'Louisiana', 'LA', 'was', 'held', 'legendary', 'Shreveport', 'Municipal', 'Auditorium', 'success', 'Louisiana', 'Hayride', 'included', '1', 'Hit', 'Lovesick', 'Blues', 'was', 'living', 'Shreveport', 'son', 'Randall', 'Hank', 'Jr.', 'was', 'born', 'time', 'spent', 'Shreveport', 'were', 'best', 'years', 'short', 'life.The', 'success', 'Lovesick', 'Blues', 'lead', 'invitation', 'join', 'Grand', 'Ole', 'Orpy', 'Nashville', 'Tenn.', 'success', 'there', 'continued', 'quite', 'sometime', 'was', 'head-liner', 'Act', 'many', 'Grand', 'Ole', 'Opry', 'Tours', 'other', 'tours', 'famous', 'Hadacol', 'Medicine', 'Show', 'Tour', 'Hank', 'headlined', 'Hank', 'New', 'York', 'Tony', 'Bennett', 'when', 'Tony', 'Bennett', 'recorded', 'Hank', 'Cold', 'Cold', 'Heart', '.During', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'Hank', 'music', 'radio', 'Juke', 'boxes', 'came', 'up', 'ghost', 'writer', 'name', 'Luke', 'Drifter', 'released', 'many', 'songs', 'name', 'Luke', 'Drifter', '.Finally', 'pressure', 'sucess', 'Hank', 'stuggle', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Audrey', 'lifestyle', 'lead', 'being', 'fired', 'Grand', 'Ole', 'Orpy', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'was', 'fired', 'Opry', 'also', 'moved', 'back', 'Louisiana', 're-joined', 'Louisiana', 'Hayride', 'Show', 'remained', 'employed', 'there', 'death.The', 'Dvd', 'recreate', 'death', 'night', 'Dec.31,1952/Jan.1,1953', 'where', 'was', 'traveling', 'Montgomery', 'Canton', 'Ohio', 'do', 'New', 'Years', 'Day', 'show', 'Using', 'baby', 'Blue', '1952', 'cadillac', 'journey', 'even', 'Knoxville', 'Hotel', 'where', 'Hank', 'checked', 'while', 'same', 'bus', 'boy', 'who', 'served', 'Hank', 'night', 'still', 'alive', 'interviewed', 'Dvd', 'Also', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'drove', 'Hank', 'Knoxville', 'Hospital', 'where', 'was', 'pronounced', 'dead', 'interviewed', 'Hank', 'was', 'living', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'time', 'was', 'vacation', 'Louisiana', 'Hayride', 'show', 'was', 'staying', 'Montgomery', 'AL', 'According', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'morning', 'Hank', 'got', 'up', 'make', 'final', 'trip', 'told', 'Jesus', 'was', 'coming', 'get', 'today', 'dvd', 'even', 'replica', 'Service', 'Station', '1952', 'driver', 'pulled', 'seek', 'help', 'recreation', 'event', 'when', 'realize', 'something', 'bad', 'wrong.It', 'very', 'comphresive', 'documentary', 'dvd', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'like', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'just', 'good', 'documentary/biography', 'American/Country', 'Music', 'legend', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'one', 'therefore', 'highly', 'recommend']",Hank Williams: Honky Tonk Blues

His body of work includes standards, hymns (little did I know that ""I saw the light"" was written by Hank; it seems to have been around forever in church), country, ballads, etc. He was the real deal when it comes to country music - not the blow-dry pretty boys and silicone girls that do country music today. He was an ok guitarist, a very good country singer, and an unbelievably talented composer. He (and most of his crowd (especially the women)) was white trash from Alabama - but with talent from heaven. What is clear from this documentary is that no one was taking care of Hank and that his two wives probably sped up his death through neglect and self-centerdness. His first wife was disowned by Hank jr. after years of impossible behavior on her part. His second wife comes across as a very unpleasant woman interested in no one but herself.

827126,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00028G7JI,Robert Moore,"[17, 18]","In my opinion the great 20th century American songwriters were Bob Dylan, Cole Porter, Woody Guthrie, and Hank Williams.  His stature is acknowledged in this film in part by the failure to bring this point home.  The filmmakers clearly assume that anyone watching the film is aware of Hank Williams importance not just in country music, but in music period.  The debate is not whether he is the premier country songwriter, but who the second most important writer is.  There is a lot of talk of the Great American Songbook, comprised by the work of figures like Cole Porter, the Gershwins, and Irving Berlin, but it is also true that there is a Great American Country Songbook.  And Hank Williams wrote it.  He may also be the most influential country singer as well.  George Jones and Lefty Frizzell are usually regarded as the greatest of all male country singers, but neither has influenced other singers in quite the way Williams has.  Other singers listen to Jones and Frizzell, but they sing like Hank Williams.The only weakness of the film is that doesn't quite communicate the bleakness of Williams's life as glimpsed through the various biographies.  I've read two biographies on Williams (including the one by Colin Escott, whose book provided the basis for the screenplay that Escott assisted on) and both convey far more than the documentary the remarkable emptiness of Williams's life.  He was simultaneously a very simple and enormously complex individual.  He had astonishingly few interests or obsessions apart from music, religion, women, drinking, comic books, and fishing, yet he produced a body of work that is clearly the achievement of a genius.  His songs are perhaps the most passionate that have ever been written.  Although I rank Dylan, Porter, and Guthrie as his equals as writers, none of them contained much in the way of passion and heartache.  None of those three could have penned lines such as:It's hard to know another's lips will kiss youAnd hold you just the way I used to doOh heaven only knows how much I miss youI can't help it if I'm still in love with youThe film does make very clear that Williams was deeply unhappy, but a book can do a better job of portraying this by depicting a host of unpleasant incidents, whereas the documentary is restricted to only a few.  In the biographies I have read Williams's life emerges as one of grim unpleasantness.The film does a great job of hitting all the highlights in Williams's career.  There is a great deal of archival footage and photos, along with a fair amount of tasteful period recreation.  It also gives a good impression of Williams's music as a whole, with one major exception:  very little of his gospel music is included in the documentary nor is it even hinted at.  But his explicitly religious recordings are among his most personal and affecting work.Williams's demise is dealt with in tasteful manner.  Although it is tragic that he died so young, it is unlikely that he could have lived much longer under any circumstances.  Even without the binge drinking and the drug abuse that resulted from attempting to deal with the intense suffering caused by his back problems (as the film points out, medical experts feel that he suffered from undiagnosed spinal bifida) he never looked healthy in any of the photos or film footage one sees.I strongly recommend this to anyone who doesn't know much about Williams's life.  He is clearly the dominant figure even today in country music and the absolutely stunning number of great songs he wrote are familiar even to those who are unaware that Williams wrote them.  History is made as much by people who shape a culture as by those who shape a nation's politics, and by that standard Williams is one of the great figures in American history.  I can imagine no better introduction to him than this film.",5,A simply outstanding documentary on a major musical figure,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,3847,"['opinion', 'great', '20th', 'century', 'American', 'songwriters', 'were', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'stature', 'acknowledged', 'film', 'part', 'failure', 'bring', 'point', 'home', 'filmmakers', 'clearly', 'assume', 'anyone', 'watching', 'film', 'aware', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'importance', 'not', 'just', 'country', 'music', 'music', 'period', 'debate', 'not', 'premier', 'country', 'songwriter', 'who', 'second', 'most', 'important', 'writer', 'lot', 'talk', 'Great', 'American', 'Songbook', 'comprised', 'work', 'figures', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Gershwins', 'Irving', 'Berlin', 'also', 'true', 'Great', 'American', 'Country', 'Songbook', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'wrote', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'most', 'influential', 'country', 'singer', 'well', 'George', 'Jones', 'Lefty', 'Frizzell', 'are', 'usually', 'regarded', 'greatest', 'male', 'country', 'singers', 'influenced', 'other', 'singers', 'quite', 'way', 'Williams', 'Other', 'singers', 'listen', 'Jones', 'Frizzell', 'sing', 'Hank', 'Williams.The', 'only', 'weakness', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'communicate', 'bleakness', 'Williams', 'life', 'glimpsed', 'various', 'biographies', ""'ve"", 'read', 'two', 'biographies', 'Williams', 'including', 'one', 'Colin', 'Escott', 'book', 'provided', 'basis', 'screenplay', 'Escott', 'assisted', 'convey', 'far', 'more', 'documentary', 'remarkable', 'emptiness', 'Williams', 'life', 'was', 'simultaneously', 'very', 'simple', 'enormously', 'complex', 'individual', 'had', 'astonishingly', 'few', 'interests', 'obsessions', 'apart', 'music', 'religion', 'women', 'drinking', 'comic', 'books', 'fishing', 'yet', 'produced', 'body', 'work', 'clearly', 'achievement', 'genius', 'songs', 'are', 'perhaps', 'most', 'passionate', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'written', 'rank', 'Dylan', 'Porter', 'Guthrie', 'equals', 'writers', 'none', 'contained', 'much', 'way', 'passion', 'heartache', 'None', 'three', 'could', 'have', 'penned', 'lines', 'such', 'hard', 'know', 'lips', 'will', 'kiss', 'youAnd', 'hold', 'just', 'way', 'used', 'doOh', 'heaven', 'only', 'how', 'much', 'miss', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', ""'m"", 'still', 'love', 'youThe', 'film', 'make', 'very', 'clear', 'Williams', 'was', 'deeply', 'unhappy', 'book', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'portraying', 'depicting', 'host', 'unpleasant', 'incidents', 'documentary', 'restricted', 'only', 'few', 'biographies', 'have', 'read', 'Williams', 'life', 'one', 'grim', 'unpleasantness.The', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'hitting', 'highlights', 'Williams', 'career', 'great', 'deal', 'archival', 'footage', 'photos', 'fair', 'amount', 'tasteful', 'period', 'recreation', 'also', 'good', 'impression', 'Williams', 'music', 'whole', 'one', 'major', 'exception', 'very', 'little', 'gospel', 'music', 'included', 'documentary', 'even', 'hinted', 'explicitly', 'religious', 'recordings', 'are', 'most', 'personal', 'affecting', 'work.Williams', 'demise', 'dealt', 'tasteful', 'manner', 'tragic', 'died', 'so', 'young', 'unlikely', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'much', 'longer', 'circumstances', 'Even', 'binge', 'drinking', 'drug', 'abuse', 'resulted', 'attempting', 'deal', 'intense', 'suffering', 'caused', 'back', 'problems', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'medical', 'experts', 'feel', 'suffered', 'undiagnosed', 'spinal', 'bifida', 'never', 'looked', 'healthy', 'photos', 'film', 'footage', 'one', 'sees.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Williams', 'life', 'clearly', 'dominant', 'figure', 'even', 'today', 'country', 'music', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'number', 'great', 'songs', 'wrote', 'are', 'familiar', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'unaware', 'Williams', 'wrote', 'History', 'made', 'much', 'people', 'who', 'shape', 'culture', 'who', 'shape', 'nation', 'politics', 'standard', 'Williams', 'one', 'great', 'figures', 'American', 'history', 'can', 'imagine', 'better', 'introduction', 'film']",Hank Williams: Honky Tonk Blues
