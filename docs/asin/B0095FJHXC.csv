1585376,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0095FJHXC,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","Perry Mason Season 8 Volume 1These fifteen TV shows from 1964 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The books are more complete and informative, they tell about life that is not experienced by most people. The books explain why some things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ""ropers"", rough or smooth shadows, how to evade surveillance, and avoid leaving a back trail. Some questioned the legality and ethics of Perry Mason's tactics but the stories were written before modern legal rules. The background tells about life in Los Angeles and America. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on today's broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? Erle Stanley Gardner was a founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free the unjustly convicted. Gardner sought to use scientific means to find the guilty rather than using hunches or guesses alone.The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Some of the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent, but these films have a higher contrast than in earlier seasons. These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings and often tell about the law. The titles begin with ""The Case of The"". Most are not from the novels except those with a year after the title.""Missing Button"";  ""Paper Bullets"";""Scandalous Sculptor"";  ""Sleepy Slayer"".""Betrayed Bride"";  ""Nautical Knot"";""Bullied Bowler"";  ""Place Called Midnight"".""Tragic Trophy"";  ""Reckless Rock Hound"";""Latent Lover"";  ""Wooden Nickels""""Blonde Bonanza"" (1954);  ""Ruinous Road"";""Frustrated Folksinger"".",5,The Original Courtroom Drama,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,2206,"['Perry', 'Mason', 'Season', '8', 'Volume', '1These', 'fifteen', 'TV', 'shows', '1964', 'are', 'based', 'novels', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'books', 'are', 'more', 'complete', 'informative', 'tell', 'life', 'not', 'experienced', 'most', 'people', 'books', 'explain', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'films', 'only', 'show', 'what', 'happened', 'books', 'tell', 'ropers', 'rough', 'smooth', 'shadows', 'how', 'evade', 'surveillance', 'avoid', 'leaving', 'back', 'trail', 'questioned', 'legality', 'ethics', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'tactics', 'stories', 'were', 'written', 'modern', 'legal', 'rules', 'background', 'life', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'America', 'nothing', 'dramatic', 'stories', 'today', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'trial', 'lawyer', 'hero', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'was', 'founder', 'Court', 'Last', 'Resort', 'sought', 'free', 'unjustly', 'convicted', 'Gardner', 'sought', 'use', 'scientific', 'means', 'find', 'guilty', 'rather', 'using', 'hunches', 'alone.The', 'seeming', 'reality', 'stories', 'due', 'part', 'characters', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'original', 'stories', 'were', 'modified', 'TV', 'theme', 'music', 'typical', 'late', '1950s', 'Note', 'style', 'clothing', 'culture', 'ladies', 'wore', 'white', 'gloves', 'People', 'seldom', 'lock', 'doors', 'prices', 'date', 'films', 'One', 'advantage', 'seeing', 'many', 'automobiles', 'era', 'How', 'many', 'can', 'identify', 'Note', 'slimness', 'people', 'smoking', 'familiarity', 'pistols', 'Watch', 'how', 'actors', 'express', 'emotions', 'facial', 'expressions', 'camera', 'sharpness', 'quality', 'excellent', 'films', 'have', 'higher', 'contrast', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'stories', 'often', 'use', 'misinterpretation', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'provide', 'dramatic', 'effects', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'are', 'usually', 'Preliminary', 'Hearings', 'often', 'tell', 'law', 'titles', 'begin', 'Case', 'Most', 'are', 'not', 'novels', 'year', 'title', 'Missing', 'Button', 'Paper', 'Bullets', 'Scandalous', 'Sculptor', 'Sleepy', 'Slayer', 'Betrayed', 'Bride', 'Nautical', 'Knot', 'Bullied', 'Bowler', 'Place', 'Called', 'Midnight', 'Tragic', 'Trophy', 'Reckless', 'Rock', 'Hound', 'Latent', 'Lover', 'Wooden', 'Nickels', 'Blonde', 'Bonanza', '1954', 'Ruinous', 'Road', 'Frustrated', 'Folksinger']","Perry Mason: Season 8, Vol. 1"

We were usually joined by some of our neighbors since we were one of the few families in the neighborhood who owned a T.V. set.

Christmas in July . Even though the show debuted before I was born, I remember watching reruns with my Dad as a little girl.. I didn't really understand the stories back then, I just knew that I loved Perry Mason and wanted to be Della Street when I grew up. so pretty, so perfect, so poised. The pros for Season 8..still deliciously black and white. Still has that film noir quality. The wonderful cars, outfits, hairstyles.. The cons, and there are several. No Lt. Tragg... at lest I haven't seen him  yet and I'm about 2/3 of the way thru both volumes. The stories are somewhat blase , I have to yet to find one that is really engrossing.. In every other season, there's been at least a few episodes that stand out, that I can watch over and over, a few that come to mind.. The Crimson Kiss, the howling dog, the crooked candle, the Calendar girl, the bigamous spouse, Double entry mind .. I have yet to find one really stand out episode in Season 8... but having said that, It's still Perry Mason and it's still worthwhile. Once I get all the way thru, I'll start to revisit some episodes. I do have to say though, a little disappointed with this season. Okay, I've gone thru all the episodes and there are few that I am really enjoying.. oddly , they all seem to be on the 2nd volume..

For those who watch the series closely, you'll notice some subtle changes by the beginning of the eighth season.  Maybe the 1964- 1965 season reflects the world that changed after JFK's assassination in November 1963, but you'll see a bit edgier Perry Mason---more reflective of the contemporary world.  You'll also notice more close ups and changed lighting with the addition of cinemetographer John M . Nickolaus.  In terms of music, the early years of Perry Mason reflected the stock CBS music library--much of which was created by Bernard Herrmann in the 1950's.  Seasons 8 and 9 reflect specific music scored by Richard Shores.  Ray Collins (Lt Tragg) is only seen very rarely--even though his name  is listed in the credits of every show through the end of the 8th season-----he was suffering from emphysema and died in July of 1965.Some say that the series best years ended by the seventh season.

I had not seen many of the later (season 8 & 9) episodes and have to say there are some good episodes here but i do feel the show was missing or loosing something as this season began. First off the stories are very hard to understand. At times I found myself getting a little lost plus I noticed that the set up to the murder does not occur until 30 minutes into the episode leaving 20 mins for Perry to solve the mystery which at times seems a bit rushed. I just finished ""The case of a place called midnight"" and without a doubt this was the most diffuclt and boring episode of the entire series. I could not get into the story line and it seemed as if too much was happening too quick. Terrible plot and writing. I hope the remainder of the season and season 9 does not have episodes like this one because I will be downright disapointed. This series was one of the best in its early days. I can almost recite the early cases. They always held your interest and were more simplified to follow along with the story. I guess the writers and producers were moving into heavier story lines with the changing times or running out of ways to keep the series moving along.

When Perry Mason was being broadcast, the networks would send their programs out via tight-beam microwave and telephone lines.  The video was transmitted using line-of-site microwave towers and the audio was sent via dedicated long distance telephone lines.  The video was OK, but the audio had a very limited bandwidth. It had a frequency response of about 100 to 5000 Hz (cycles per second), slightly better than what a telephone conversation would sound like.The audio of these shows you are now watching on DVD seem to be poorly mixed.  Yes, they were probably getting sloppy in the 7th and 8th seasons when they printed the final copy.  But, they knew then the filtering effect of the long distance telephone line amplifiers would even things out.  That's why the music seems very bright and voices in comparison seem muffled. I don't think there was any effort on the part of the DVD makers to clean up the audio track much less one or two of the video tracks.There are one or two episodes in the beginning of the DVD collection where the picture suddenly turns green or brown in several of the courtroom scene changes.  They were probably using a defective roll of film in one of the cameras.  You can see the picture change to green on one scene and then back to normal when it switches back to another scene.  During the original broadcasts, the video was sent out in black and white hiding this occurrence.  So, rather than reshoot the whole take, they left it up to the broadcast engineers to adjust for and filter out this problem.Although the complete 18 volume set will end up being exceedingly expensive, something over $600 for all 9 seasons, the DVDs thus far have been good.",5,Audio and Video Tracks on the DVDs,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,1849,"['days', 'Old', 'when', 'TV', 'was', 'well', 'NBC', 'CBS', 'ABC', 'broadcast', 'engineers', 'would', 'use', 'number', 'techniques', 'clean', 'up', 'errors', 'production', 'filming', 'When', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'was', 'being', 'broadcast', 'networks', 'would', 'send', 'programs', 'out', 'tight-beam', 'microwave', 'telephone', 'lines', 'video', 'was', 'transmitted', 'using', 'line-of-site', 'microwave', 'towers', 'audio', 'was', 'sent', 'dedicated', 'long', 'distance', 'telephone', 'lines', 'video', 'was', 'OK', 'audio', 'had', 'very', 'limited', 'bandwidth', 'had', 'frequency', 'response', 'about', '100', '5000', 'Hz', 'cycles', 'second', 'slightly', 'better', 'what', 'telephone', 'conversation', 'would', 'sound', 'like.The', 'audio', 'shows', 'are', 'now', 'watching', 'DVD', 'seem', 'be', 'poorly', 'mixed', 'Yes', 'were', 'probably', 'getting', 'sloppy', '7th', '8th', 'seasons', 'when', 'printed', 'final', 'copy', 'knew', 'then', 'filtering', 'effect', 'long', 'distance', 'telephone', 'line', 'amplifiers', 'would', 'even', 'things', 'out', 'why', 'music', 'very', 'bright', 'voices', 'comparison', 'seem', 'muffled', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'effort', 'part', 'DVD', 'makers', 'clean', 'up', 'audio', 'track', 'much', 'less', 'one', 'two', 'video', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'collection', 'where', 'picture', 'suddenly', 'green', 'brown', 'several', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'changes', 'were', 'probably', 'using', 'defective', 'roll', 'film', 'one', 'cameras', 'can', 'see', 'picture', 'change', 'green', 'one', 'scene', 'then', 'back', 'normal', 'when', 'back', 'scene', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'video', 'was', 'sent', 'out', 'black', 'white', 'hiding', 'occurrence', 'So', 'rather', 'reshoot', 'whole', 'take', 'left', 'up', 'broadcast', 'engineers', 'adjust', 'filter', 'out', 'complete', '18', 'volume', 'set', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'exceedingly', 'expensive', 'something', '600', '9', 'seasons', 'DVDs', 'thus', 'far', 'have', 'been', 'good']","Perry Mason: Season 8, Vol. 1"
