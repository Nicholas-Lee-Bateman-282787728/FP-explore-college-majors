10364,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0767810872,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The Juror, 1996 filmA teenager hears noise from another bedroom at night. Shots are fired! He runs away, but a man runs after him and fires a shot. Next we are in a courtroom where jurors are polled. A single woman is questioned about her life. [Should she be talking about this case? No.] A man is following her as she picks up her teenage son. Will a burglar plant a listening device in her home, then make copies of documents and photos? An outside parabolic antenna listens to conversations in her home. Later a stranger recognizes her and buys her lunch. Mark Cordell is a friendly stranger. Back at home Mark tells Annie what he knows about her and her son Oliver. &#8220;They will be safe.&#8221; As long as she votes &#8220;not guilty&#8221;!The jurors listen to a tape recording about a &#8220;teacher&#8221;. He arranged a deal with a Colombian Drug Cartel. Rodney arrives to visit Mark, who is busy. Another man greets Annie in a grocery store to deliver a message. &#8220;He killed my baby&#8221; says a witness. [Leaving a live witness?] Oliver says &#8220;everybody knows he&#8217;s guilty&#8221; (the media says so). [A reference to a current event?] Annie goes to see the judge alone, but he wants counsel present. Later Mark meets Annie and takes for a ride with Rodney. Mark speeds on a country road and passes a boy on a bicycle. Later there is a spectacular car accident! Eddie takes her home. At the end of the trial ten jurors say &#8220;guilty&#8221;, two vote &#8220;not guilty&#8221;. The jury continues to deliberate. Mark meets the son of the gang leader and is given orders. They want an acquittal! Can Annie change their votes? What about that necklace? Will the other jurors go along? Should the law be twisted because of a man&#8217;s reputation? The jury arrives at a verdict. [Does this seem believable?]Lou greets Mark, who gets a payoff. Lou worries about that lady. Later Federal agents visit Annie to ask about her decision. &#8220;Who else will protect you?&#8221; Elsewhere Annie&#8217;s friend meets &#8220;Paul&#8221; who takes her to a night club. Later she is given some sleeping pills. What will Annie thing of this? Annie moved away! Mark uses his computer to search airline information. Guatemala City. A picture provides the name of a city. Can Annie&#8217;s friend provide a home for Oliver? &#8220;She had to come back.&#8221; Will she wear a wire? Yes, but she talks to Mark about it. Mark confides in her. &#8220;I do love you.&#8221; Will Annie provide some information to make a deal? Rodney visits Mark to invite him to a meeting. Will Mark return that money? He visits Louie. Who will be discarded? There is a big surprise for some! Who will arrive in Guatemala City first? There is a public festival (based on folklore). Mark gets a big surprise! Mark laughs. &#8220;It has to be that way.&#8221; Will there be a happy ending?This is an interesting story in spite of the implausible events. Maybe it is more believable in a book rather than a movie? Can Annie, a sculptress, show such hidden strengths? Perhaps, but I don&#8217;t find it credible. Slipping a sleeping pill into a drink can kill a person, but what about the Medical Examiner? If a person habitually uses a sleeping pill could this mask the poisoning? Your opinion may vary. The value in this movie is its warning about giving out personal information to strangers (as in &#8220;The Net&#8221;). This may be why some artists chose a reclusive life or avoid unwanted publicity.",3,The Trial of a Gangster,1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,3497,"['Juror', '1996', 'filmA', 'teenager', 'hears', 'noise', 'bedroom', 'night', 'Shots', 'are', 'fired', 'away', 'man', 'shot', 'are', 'courtroom', 'where', 'jurors', 'are', 'polled', 'single', 'woman', 'questioned', 'life', '[', 'Should', 'be', 'talking', 'case', 'No', ']', 'man', 'following', 'up', 'teenage', 'son', 'Will', 'burglar', 'plant', 'listening', 'device', 'home', 'then', 'make', 'copies', 'documents', 'photos', 'outside', 'parabolic', 'antenna', 'conversations', 'home', 'Later', 'stranger', 'lunch', 'Mark', 'Cordell', 'friendly', 'stranger', 'Back', 'home', 'Mark', 'Annie', 'what', 'son', 'Oliver', '8220', 'will', 'be', 'safe.', '8221', 'As', 'long', '8220', 'not', 'guilty', '8221', 'jurors', 'listen', 'tape', 'recording', '8220', '8221', 'arranged', 'deal', 'Colombian', 'Drug', 'Cartel', 'Rodney', 'visit', 'Mark', 'who', 'busy', 'man', 'Annie', 'grocery', 'store', 'deliver', 'message', '8220', 'killed', 'baby', '8221', 'witness', '[', 'Leaving', 'live', 'witness', 'Oliver', '8220', 'everybody', '8217', 'guilty', '8221', 'media', 'so', '[', 'reference', 'current', 'event', ']', 'Annie', 'see', 'judge', 'alone', 'counsel', 'present', 'Later', 'Mark', 'Annie', 'ride', 'Rodney', 'Mark', 'country', 'road', 'boy', 'bicycle', 'Later', 'spectacular', 'car', 'accident', 'Eddie', 'home', 'end', 'trial', 'ten', 'jurors', 'say', '8220', 'guilty', '8221', 'two', 'vote', '8220', 'not', 'guilty', '8221', 'jury', 'deliberate', 'Mark', 'son', 'gang', 'leader', 'given', 'orders', 'want', 'acquittal', 'Can', 'Annie', 'change', 'votes', 'What', 'necklace', 'Will', 'other', 'jurors', 'go', 'along', 'Should', 'law', 'be', 'twisted', 'man', '8217', 'reputation', 'jury', 'verdict', '[', 'seem', 'believable', ']', 'Lou', 'greets', 'Mark', 'who', 'payoff', 'Lou', 'lady', 'Later', 'Federal', 'agents', 'visit', 'Annie', 'ask', 'decision', '8220', 'Who', 'else', 'will', 'protect', '8221', 'Elsewhere', 'Annie', '8217', 'friend', 'meets', '8220', 'Paul', '8221', 'who', 'night', 'club', 'Later', 'given', 'sleeping', 'pills', 'What', 'will', 'Annie', 'thing', 'Annie', 'moved', 'away', 'Mark', 'computer', 'search', 'airline', 'information', 'Guatemala', 'City', 'picture', 'name', 'city', 'Can', 'Annie', '8217', 'friend', 'provide', 'home', 'Oliver', '8220', 'had', 'come', 'back.', '8221', 'Will', 'wear', 'wire', 'Yes', 'Mark', 'Mark', '8220', 'do', 'love', 'you.', '8221', 'Will', 'Annie', 'provide', 'information', 'make', 'deal', 'Rodney', 'Mark', 'invite', 'meeting', 'Will', 'Mark', 'return', 'money', 'Louie', 'Who', 'will', 'be', 'discarded', 'big', 'surprise', 'Who', 'will', 'arrive', 'Guatemala', 'City', 'first', 'public', 'festival', 'based', 'folklore', 'Mark', 'big', 'surprise', 'Mark', '8220', 'be', 'way.', '8221', 'Will', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'interesting', 'story', 'spite', 'implausible', 'events', 'Maybe', 'more', 'believable', 'book', 'rather', 'movie', 'Can', 'Annie', 'sculptress', 'show', 'such', 'hidden', 'strengths', 'Perhaps', 'don', '8217', 'find', 'credible', 'Slipping', 'sleeping', 'pill', 'drink', 'can', 'kill', 'person', 'what', 'Medical', 'Examiner', 'person', 'habitually', 'sleeping', 'pill', 'could', 'mask', 'poisoning', 'opinion', 'may', 'vary', 'value', 'movie', 'warning', 'giving', 'out', 'personal', 'information', 'strangers', '8220', 'Net', '8221', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'artists', 'chose', 'reclusive', 'life', 'avoid', 'unwanted', 'publicity']",N/A

Luster ""The Rook""","[2, 2]","Last night I started watching this DVD and my wife soon put down her Harry Potter book because this movie drew her into the suspense. It pulls peoples attention into it because of the fine acting by Alec Baldwin and Demi Moore and a great storyline. The rest of the supporting cast are good as well.The story is a fresh one, a juror is first courted then tormented by a hit man for the mob. Alec Baldwin is quite adept at being scary when he wants to be and charming as well. Demi is by no means a helpless beauty. She shows herself to be artistic, intelligent, and resourceful as well.When first threatened she succumbs to the demands of ""The Teacher"", but when he murders her closest friend, she sets a course for revenge. If the mob can't help her she will enlist the assistance of her friends in South America. One gets a pretty good idea of how a womans inner strength can prevail over the worst evil.The DVD includes extras and has excellent picture and sound quality. Anyone that enjoys suspense movies like ""Witness"", ""The Client"", and ""Narrow Margin"", or TV series like ""The Sopranos"" should like this movie.

It is a run-of-the-mill story about a single mother (Demi Moore) who is being pressured by an organized crime figure (Alec Baldwin) to vote &quot;not guilty&quot; on a high profile trial.  The mob's leverage is her love for her son. Yawn.  But Moore and Baldwin turn in fine performances:  Moore as the defiant, intelligent, and terrified Annie, and Baldwin as her sociopath handler. Baldwin is so convincingly creepy and so demented in his take on everything that the audience fears intensely for Annie's survival.This film contains some honestly terrifying sequences.  Unfortunately, the ending is weak, and you're left with few memorable scenes.

10369,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0767810872,Dennis Littrell,"[23, 25]","Alec Baldwin comes on quoting from the Tao Te Ching, making me think he's my kind of anti hero.  He's urban, sophisticated and seemingly very safe  since he's an art curator, or seems to be.  Demi Moore as Annie Laird, a  gifted and original sculptor (she sculpts works of art that you feel with  your hands by reaching up into them: it's all tactile), is thrilled when he  offers to buy her work and sell it to the Japanese.  Wow.  She has arrived  as an artist.Thus we have an intriguing and original premise for a  thriller.  One almost wishes that there weren't this little matter of her  agreeing to serve on the jury in the case of a Mafia boss on trial for  murder..I will gloss over the excellent, if unlikely, plot since it  would be preemptive to reveal any of it, and concentrate on Demi Moore who  is gorgeous, strange and riveting.It might seem impossible to give an  ""heroic"" performance in a thriller, since the point of a thriller is pure  entertainment, but this movie manages to look into the nature of good and  evil a bit more than most, and Moore plays her part like our dream of a  true heroine.  Her character has strength and cunning; she's sharp without  pretension.  I always thought Moore was better than her reputation, but  somehow she always seemed a little on the not entirely bright side, the  kind of actress who would never presume to play Shakespeare.  But now I  think she's a ""natural,"" like a gifted athlete-I'd almost say an  ""animal""-as an actress, which is probably why some people don't like her.  She can project the beautiful woman, an ordinary woman, or herself as a  matronly woman with just a turn of her head.  She can display a wide range  of emotions and be, by turns, both a masculine and a feminine entity; but  she is not androgynous.  The role she plays here is, in a sense, the  feminine counterpart of many Harrison Ford roles, the ordinary person  elevated to heroic action by compelling circumstances.  I would not say  that Demi Moore is a great actress, but she is close, and I could be  wrong.Alec Baldwin combines megalomania with a seductive cynicism.  He  fills the screen with his presence like something you can't get rid of.  He  is so compelling you want to push him away or just give up.  And he is  charming-evil, but charming.Brian Gibson's direction is unobtrusive and  clever, and he pays attention to detail.  The script is relatively free of  the implausibilities that usually mar the genre, and the editing is crisp  without jarring.  The story practically transcends the genre by making us  feel the evil of violent crime and how it perverts society, the sort of  revelation not usually attempted in a thriller.  I was especially  delighted to see the Mafia demeaned and defeated, even if it's only by a  new breed of international criminal.

10377,A34FSS6DNL1UJ,0767810872,"""iriley1979""","[2, 8]","This movie is well directed, has a great script, but what really makes it a exceptional movie is the acting. Demi Moore and Alec Baldwin both turn in the best performances of their respective careers. Moore is very beliviable as a single mom who is a strugling artist with a good heart. Baldwin gives an amazing performance as a sociopath who ""works"" for a mafia family. In reality Baldwin's influence is so powerful that it almost seems like the mafia family really works for him. At the very least Baldwin only takes orders from the Boss himself, he does not listen to anyone else. Everyone fears him, and rightly so, his nickname is ""the teacher"" because ""when you see him school's out"". Baldwin gives this nickname depth and meaning, he really is a teacher in a sick, sadistic way, he teaches Annie, (Demi Moore's character) the way the world really works and how vunerable she is. He teachers her that safety is an illusion of modern society. Baldwin's character's real name in this film is Vincent, but Annie never knows that, to her he is only the Teacher. The Teacher is much worse than the other mafiosa, he is cultured, very good looking, well mannered, charming, he seems like some kind of hot shot buisness man or some sort of elite member of high society. The way he speaks makes him sound like a ivy leauge educated rich guy. The last thing he seems like is a hit man for the mob and that is precisly why he is so dangerous. He is like a chamleion, he can disguise his true nature so expertly it is spooky. This is because he almost convinces himself he is someone else, to a certain extent he tricks himself into forgetting who he really is temporarily and emerses himself in the character. He is not really just a hitman for the mob, he is that but he is other things as well, he is the No.1 assassin but he is also the Counslieria (remember Robert Duvuall as Tom Hagan in the Godfather) he advises the Don on policy. The Teacher is slowly but surely taking over control of the Mafia family, he is setting up deals with Italian Mafia from Calabra, he is negotiating with Columbians, Jamacians, etc. He is turning this mafia family from a localized crime operation into an international crimal enterprise. He has vision, direction, and is pretty much a evil genuis. He has a keen understanding of human psychology and although he feels fear he uses it to make him stronger ""I embrace fear Annie, it is terror that teaches us our shape."" This might sound like abstarct silly philosphy but he applies it to the criminal world with lucrative results. Even within the mafia family he consults for/kills for/directs he is feared. He has no friends, he is useful to the mafia as a weapon which everyone fears but having him around is a double edged sword. The Don's son,(played by the guy who played Jackie, the first boss who died of cancer before Tony took over on the Sopranos) hates the Teacher and realizes that he is no good, bad things have a way of happening around him, people are always dying, even more so than usual. The Teacher is nothing but BAD NEWS and the Don's son realizes this instinctvly. He is manipulating the mob family for his own interests, invovling this local crime family with orgazinations that are international in nature and much more powerful than they are. He is getting the mafia in over its head, I know how weird this might sound but it is accurate. The Italian mafia from Italy and the Colombians are much worse than the American Iatalin mob, the people who run them are more like the Teacher than like the other mobsters in the family ""works for"". They are nothing but cold blooded killers with no morals. The Teacher is sort of like a tiger among wolves, the most dangerous predator in the jungle. The viewer never really understands what makes the Teacher tick, he seems to be building this criminal empire out of bordom. He is not really that interested in material things, he lives in a garage, dresses in jeans and t-shirts, etc. The Teacher defies catoragazation, he be anything he chooses, he can be a gangster, an art curator, a philsopher, anything. He carries a silenced pistol with him wherever he goes, he makes the other mob guys look like clowns, amatures. He has no equals, he has yet to met his match, until he meets Annie. In a strange way Moore's character understands the Teacher better than anyone else and is more able to predict his actions. She has femine insights and guile that the other mobsters lack, she realizes she can manipulate the Teacher eventually, although it is an exteemly dangerous game to play. Annie is very smart, in her own way just as smart as the Teacher and she has the distinct advantage of not being insane which is the only weakness the Teacher has, altough it is also in a way his greatest strength because it allowes him to think outside the box. Supporting cast in this movie include good performances by Ann Hesh as Annie's well intentioned but naive and nosy friend. James Gadofini of Soprano's fame plays a mob underling who was intially responsible for recruiting Vincent A.K.A. the Teacher into the mob. The Teacher is from a poor backround and grew up in the same neighborhood that all the other mobseters grew up in, although you would not know it by the way he acts, talks, etc. The facade of the Teacher is all an illusion, even when he acts as a gangster it is still an illusion, he is sort of like a serial killer but at the same time not really, he does not fit into any sort of catogary. The only time he is really himself is when he is killing someone or intimidating them, the mafia and all his criminal manuverings are merely a hobby to him, a vehicle by which to impose his will and kill people. The Teacher is one of the greatest villians ever to be put on film, almost like a Satanic pshycotherapist, if you can imagine that. Baldwin and Moore have terrific chemistry on screen together, the relationship between their characters is what really makes the film, this movie is a psycological thriller that requires that the viewer have intellect, perhaps this is why it did not make money and many people do not like it, it went over their heads. Also this movie is very realistic in its portrayl of violence and everything else, not once did I say to myself, that would never happen, etc. Some reviwers think that this movie is unrealistic because the mob could not get to a jury like it did, please, wake up and smell the coffee. The mob has gotten to plenty of juries and continues to do so. Informers in the legal, justice, and law enforcement systems enable the mafia to know what the cops are planning ahead of time. This movie is distrubing in that the forces of law are either corrupt of inept, but that is the truth and anyone who thinks diffent is a fool. The kid who plays Annie's son in this movie does a very good job as well. The plot of this movie is basically that while The Teacher is elimanting all restance to his rule, he kills another mobster and also kills his 12 year old kid. The mob don is brought to trial on charges that he ordered that killing as well as other RICO charges. As soon as Annie decides to serve on the jury The Teacher selects her as the one to turn into their tool to get the don off. He comes up with a brillant plan no normal mobster ever would have thought of, instead of just trying to get Annie to vote Not Guilty he uses her to get an acquital, he makes her convicne all the other jurors to also vote not guilty. He selected her because he saw how intelligent she was and because he could sense her inner strength, he is a good judge of character. He decides to transform her into his tool, he teachers her to be agressive, dominant, manipulative, etc. He teachers her to become almost a feminine version of himself, but in the end he teaches her to well, because she turns the lessons the Teacher taught her on the Teacher himself. That is what makes this movie interesting, the transformation of Annie's character by the Teacher to the point where she becomes confident enought to take on the teacher himself and teach the the teacher a lesson he will never forget. Their is a horrible, filthy death scene in this movie where someone is forced fed pills that will kill them, this scene is really, really, really sick. The way the Teacher approaches the whole situation is insane yet ingenious, he acts like Annie's coach or something, breaking her down and then building her up. When he threatens he does so in very sublte ways that are much more intimaditing than outright threats, he always phrases his indimaditing statements as if invisible forces are going to hurt Annie and her son and he the Teacher is the only one who can protect her and her son from these forces. For instance, ""this is a very dangerous time for Oliver right now (Annie's son) we could lose him just like that!"" and he slaps his hands together. Every scene between the Teacher and Annie is framed as a lesson, and in a sick way it is a lesson, a lesson in how evil works, a lesson in fear. Another great scene is one where he says ""I'm here to teach you what you love Annie, the suits want you to love the law, but can the law protect Oliver from Drunk Drivers?"" He says while driving a car right toward Oliver. That scene is the best scene in the movie by far, it is very intense. ""Who will protect you?"" The Teacher screams, ""The Teacher will protect me."" Annie screams back over and over. Whoa!!! That scene is nuts! Maybe the reason this movie was not popular with most people is because their is no clear cut moral message, if this movie has a message it is do not volunteer for Jury Duty, or maybe the message is dont depend on the FBI or the courts for protection. The only justice in this movie is street justice, vengeance and retribution. The Teacher is like a beautiful, charming, but venemous and deadly viper. Annie has a keen understanding of physchology as well and uses it to her advantage. Differences between The Teacher and the Don lead to explosive consquences. This movie is dark and disturbing, suspensful and shocking. One of the most underated movies of all time",4,"Justice is a fairy tale, in this movie its kill or be killed",1057190400,"07 3, 2003",2003,10131,"['movie', 'well', 'directed', 'great', 'script',

Alec Baldwin's character makes the movie shout out with sinister suspense.  He captures the crazy psychopathic personality perfectly and was wonderful to watch.The plot revolves around Annie Laird (Demi Moore), who is a single mother and an artist of sorts that lives with her son in New York.  During the day, Annie works in an office as a data entry clerk.  She is selected to be a juror in the trial of a mob boss, Louie Boffano (Tony Lo Bianco).  He is on trial for the murders of Salvador Riggio and Salvador's grandson Thomas.  He ordered their murders.Mark Cordell (played perfectly by Alec Baldwin) buys Annie's artwork.  He wants to get control of her life, her jury function and her son.  He has gone through her home without her knowing and scanned photos and documents of her life.  He knows everything.  He is impressed with Annie's intelligence and is smitten in a strange but controlling way.  Oliver, her only son (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is suspicious after he comes home.  Mark does not want Oliver to see him, but Oliver peeks down from the loft.  He understands his mother is at risk.Mark is handsome, smart, manly, strong and bold.  He wins over Annie and takes her out to reveal he is better known as ""The Teacher"" (Boffano's enforcer and hit man).  Mark tells Annie to convince the jury to acquit Boffano or her son is at risk.A frightened Annie convinces the jury to acquit Boffano.  Even after the trial Boffano does not trust her as his gut has a feeling she is a weak link.  Mark is asked to do the hit, but he has feelings for Annie.The plot develops and Cordell sees that Annie has hidden her son in Guatemala with her friend Boone (Matt Craven).  The District attorney wants Annie to turn state's witness so they can arrest Mark, who has plans to take over Boffano's empire with help of South American drug dealers.  Annie wears a wire for the DA's office, and succeeds to get Mark to boast about his plan to overthrow Boffano.  She then goes to Boffano to let him know that Mark is a backstabber and he needs to get rid of him.Mark is asked to meet with Boffano.  He seems wary while Eddie (James Gandofini), a mob member, says Boffano wants to meet again to discuss killing Annie.  Mark knows something is going on and kills Boffano, his son, and other mob members with a bomb hidden in payoff money.Mark realizes Annie set him up and is out for revenge.

A whole subplot involving the Teacher's lover and a has-been PI stimulated a lot of what is overlooked in the film version.  But I think overall director Brian Gibson did a commendable job in translating this to the screen.Demi Moore gives one of her best performances as the trapped mother; she is strong, yet vulnerable; determined and wise.  Alec Baldwin is good at playing sleazeballs, but he tempers this with a sense of sensitivity he rarely displays; Anne Heche in an early role does well in the role of Juliette, although in the book Juliette's character is more fleshed out; James Gandolfino in a pre-Sopranos role is outstanding as Baldwin's henchman, who ends up siding with Moore; and Tony Lo Bianco in a brief role as the mafia don, is perfect in his sleazy shell.THE JUROR is a manipulative movie, but done with enough style and finesse, to be a very entertaining thriller.",5,LADY JUSTICE TRICKED AGAIN,1081382400,"04 8, 2004",2004,1075,"['did', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'George', 'Dawes', 'Green', 'movie', 'based', 'missed', 'lot', 'extra', 'stuff', 'may', 'have', 'helped', 'seemingly', 'implausible', 'points', 'plot', 'whole', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Teacher', 'lover', 'has-been', 'PI', 'stimulated', 'lot', 'what', 'overlooked', 'film', 'version', 'think', 'overall', 'director', 'Brian', 'Gibson', 'did', 'commendable', 'job', 'translating', 'screen.Demi', 'Moore', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'trapped', 'mother', 'strong', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'determined', 'wise', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'good', 'playing', 'sleazeballs', 'sense', 'sensitivity', 'rarely', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'early', 'role', 'well', 'role', 'Juliette', 'book', 'Juliette', 'character', 'more', 'fleshed', 'James', 'Gandolfino', 'pre-Sopranos', 'role', 'outstanding', 'Baldwin', 'henchman', 'who', 'up', 'siding', 'Moore', 'Tony', 'Lo', 'Bianco', 'brief', 'role', 'mafia', 'don', 'perfect', 'sleazy', 'shell.THE', 'JUROR', 'manipulative', 'movie', 'done', 'enough', 'style', 'finesse', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'thriller']",N/A
10383,A27QLYGAM9AU3M,0767810872,Mike Sobocinski,"[4, 10]","Others have summarized the plot; now I shall summarize the motifs...  After a thoroughly schlocky opening sequence - murders portrayed with the usual tastelessness of so-called thriller cinema - we have the usual set up of ""the ordinary 90s family"" (which hardly has enough detail to cover the fact that it's thoroughly formulaic).  Once we have the picture in place of a well-intentioned mother and her cheerful and 90s-hip son, the film quickly decides that the audience is sufficiently prepared to be hounded, oppressed, and tortured along with the protagonists.  Really!  How much fun does this sound?  The audience is forced to endure impossibly powerful and menacing Supervillain Alec Baldwin for the next hour and a half of misery.  I suppose there are lots of viewers who will enjoy commiserating with poor Demi Moore and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but isn't it very clear that they both deserve much better fates (and roles) than this schlock?  This is a real waste of Hollywood resources.  And just how credible is the whole suit-wearing Mafia theme these days, anyway?  Hollywood just keeps building on its own myths and doesn't care one whit about credibility or reality.  In the process, I wonder just how many people are induced into paranoid fears as a result of this kind of drivel being dished out, film after film after film.  It seems that the target audience is anyone who, like Demi Moore at the start of the film, just wants some excitement in their dull lives.  But I suspect that this sort of film also presents women, teens, possibly others who feel insecure & frightened, with an extremely skewed image of life which magnifies their anxieties about a patriarchal world.  Why couldn't it be done with some realism, a bit of taste, and more dignity?  Instead, just as in slasher films, the supervillain is nearly omnipotent, and the only pathetic solution in such melodrama is (big surprise!!) that the heroine has to kill him off herself, since as everyone in Hollywood keeps telling us, there is no law in America except for the vigilante violence of those who have been pushed too far.  Some may see such violence as a helpful step for women's vicarious empowerment; but such gestures seem to me pretty feeble when relegated to this kind of ridiculous scenario.  There's no longer anything progressive in showing a woman turn violent in a ridiculously staged and antificial thriller scenario.  It's time Hollywood and its patrons grew up a bit and stopped this sort of distracting drivel in favor of things that tell it as it really is.  Whatever kernel of truth lies in this scenario should be presented realistically rather than manipulatively exaggerated; since to do so with such themes is to render them ludicrous, in which case this sort of film acts as a red herring for whatever cause people may try to attribute to it.  Clearly, these filmmakers were not bold enough to do anything except make a lurid and artificial thriller - one which purportedly sympathizes with the oppressed but, given the amount of screentime devoted to it, may actually at the same time be capitalizing on the macho-villain's grandstanding antics by appealing to sadistic and power-hungry fantasies in some male viewers!!!",1,Faugh!
