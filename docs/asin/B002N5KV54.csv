1278914,A1QT7IWSBG7KWM,B002N5KV54,"Amazon Customer ""ChiffFipple""","[1, 5]","The problem with these remaining progressive rock icons--Wakeman and Keith Emerson come to mind-- has never been their skills as musicians, which are mighty. It's always been bad taste, which is largely what euthanized  prog rock.  So, here's this film of this live performance of 6 Wives.  And out comes Wakeman in a series of capes, one of which, with its red velour and white fur trim, gives us a sort of ""Bad Santa"" vibe.  Why would someone perform a rock concert in 2009 wearing capes?  Answer: Bad taste. Then we get this completely unnecessary and embarrassing narrator, who is completely inappropriately dressed himself (not just street clothes, but lounging around on a Saturday morning clothes). He's also unrehearsed AND way over-the-top, which is not so easy to pull off.  I made it through 2 of these little interludes before I starting hitting that FF button. There are some decent moments here musically--I always thought the 6 Wives album had real merit--and they mostly come when Rick shows a bit of restraint and gives the melody, as opposed to those nearly endless flourishes of his.  That's the problem with these guys. You often end up saying ""wow, that's impressive fingering"" rather than ""wow, that's terrific music.""",1,Capes.

1278915,A2T2RJFMP9DNY2,B002N5KV54,Anibal J. Rosario Planas,"[3, 3]","Six wives is a classic album by one of progressive rock's most important keyboard players ever, Rick Wakeman (Yes). It was his first solo effort, with contributions by some of progs greatest at that time. A couple of decades later, he performs the entire album (plus a few extras that are related to the theme) in the one place where he wanted to perform it when he originally wrote and released it.It is a fantastic performance of really amazing songs, aided by the English Rock Ensamble, plus an orchestra and choir, and it is all really impressive. My one complain is that drummer Tony Fernandez (who I admire a lot) uses an electronic drumset with acoustic cymbals. Being great in dynamics, it was a surprise to see him using an electronic set, that takes away from his natural, dynamic type of playing. Other than that, this dvd is great.

1278918,A18VXA5J1UKFO,B002N5KV54,Stratocaster,"[0, 0]","I agree with almost all of the other reviewer's points of view on this DVD. Having been a die hard Yes and Wakeman fan from the very first Hammond note he struck on Roundabout/Fragile when I was about 14 years old, I would love nothing more than to give the DVD a solid 5 stars. And in most respects, it is! I mean, what more could you ask for - Rick in all his glory, the band, the orchestra, the choir, all coming together to perform what is still considered to be one of the finest Prog Rock albums of all time - All of the elements for what should be Rick's crowning achievement! The overall sound and picture quality are excellent. The musicians and their performances are, of course, second to none. My only quibbles that prevent me from making this DVD a solid 5 star?1) The audio mix - orchestral arrangements are almost totally lost in the mix throughout many of the performances. I do realize that Rick and his playing are intended to be the ""center of attention"" for the show, but there are even some points where I'd go as far as saying his keys were TO LOUD! There was plenty of ""headroom"" there in the mix to have the orchestra's parts better balanced with Rick's playing.2) This only a personal opinion, but for this show especially, I would have loved to have seen Rick bring back his old standard analog set up. A REAL Hammond, his 2 Mellotrons, 2 Mini Moogs, his old Clavicord and Electric Piano, and especially, his Grand Piano. There is one point in the show where he gets up and does play a short interlude on an actual grand piano; and the sound is absolutely heavenly. Being a keyboard player myself, I don't care if you spend $30,000 on all of the new top of the line ""Digital"" keyboards - NONE of them can EVER hold a candle to the original sounds of the Hammond, Mellotron, and Piano. There's just no warmth or character to those digital sounds. I do realize that in this day and age that moving what is equivalent to an entire house worth of furniture (a Hammond and Leslie cabinet are about 300 lbs alone, not to mention a grand piano and 2 Mellotrons) is very costly and labor intensive (plus there is the technical aspects of keeping all of those old keyboards in working order), but for this show in particular- a once in a lifetime event that he himself waited over 30 years to be able to perform - I would have thought that Rick would have taken on the extra expense and manpower.",4,"So close to perfection, but.....",1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,2413,"['agree', 'almost', 'other', 'reviewer', 'points', 'view', 'DVD', 'Having', 'been', 'die', 'hard', 'Yes', 'Wakeman', 'fan', 'very', 'first', 'Hammond', 'note', 'struck', 'Roundabout/Fragile', 'when', 'was', '14', 'years', 'old', 'would', 'love', 'nothing', 'more', 'give', 'DVD', 'solid', '5', 'stars', 'most', 'respects', 'mean', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'ask', 'Rick', 'glory', 'band', 'orchestra', 'choir', 'coming', 'together', 'perform', 'what', 'still', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'Prog', 'Rock', 'albums', 'time', 'elements', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'Rick', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'overall', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'musicians', 'performances', 'are', 'course', 'second', 'none', 'only', 'quibbles', 'prevent', 'making', 'DVD', 'solid', '5', 'star', '1', 'audio', 'mix', 'orchestral', 'arrangements', 'are', 'almost', 'totally', 'lost', 'mix', 'many', 'performances', 'do', 'realize', 'Rick', 'playing', 'are', 'intended', 'be', 'center', 'attention', 'show', 'are', 'even', 'points', 'where', ""'d"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'saying', 'keys', 'were', 'TO', 'LOUD', 'was', 'plenty', 'headroom', 'there', 'mix', 'have', 'orchestra', 'parts', 'better', 'balanced', 'Rick', 'playing.2', 'only', 'personal', 'opinion', 'show', 'especially', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'Rick', 'bring', 'back', 'old', 'standard', 'analog', 'set', 'up', 'REAL', 'Hammond', '2', 'Mellotrons', '2', 'Mini', 'Moogs', 'old', 'Clavicord', 'Electric', 'Piano', 'especially', 'Grand', 'Piano', 'one', 'point', 'show', 'where', 'up', 'play', 'short', 'interlude', 'actual', 'grand', 'piano', 'sound', 'absolutely', 'heavenly', 'Being', 'keyboard', 'player', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'spend', '30,000', 'new', 'top', 'line', 'Digital', 'keyboards', 'NONE', 'can', 'EVER', 'hold', 'candle', 'original', 'sounds', 'Hammond', 'Mellotron', 'Piano', 'just', 'warmth', 'character', 'digital', 'sounds', 'do', 'realize', 'day', 'age', 'moving', 'what', 'equivalent', 'entire', 'house', 'worth', 'furniture', 'Hammond', 'Leslie', 'cabinet', 'are', '300', 'lbs', 'alone', 'not', 'mention', 'grand', 'piano', '2', 'Mellotrons', 'very', 'costly', 'labor', 'intensive', 'technical', 'aspects', 'keeping', 'old', 'keyboards', 'working', 'order', 'show', 'particular-', 'once', 'lifetime', 'event', 'waited', '30', 'years', 'be', 'able', 'perform', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Rick', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'extra', 'expense', 'manpower']",N/A
1278919,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002N5KV54,trebe,"[0, 0]","This performance at the historic Hampton Court Palace, is the fulfillment of a dream for keyboardist extraordinaire Rick Wakeman.  This concert is epic in scale, majestically staged, rich in sounds, and historically significant.  The music is performed with dignity, emotion, and skill, truly bringing to life the compositions from Wakeman's groundbreaking concept album,Six Wives of Henry VIII(1973).Rick Wakeman gained attention as a member of The Strawbs, and Yes.  The huge success that Yes achieved with their albumFragile, lead to an opportunity for Wakeman to do a solo record, which eventually became the Six Wives.  The album contained six instrumental tracks, with the music being inspired by Wakeman's perception of the life and personality of each of Henry's spouses.In 1973, Wakeman wrote a letter to those in charge of Hampton Court Palace, requesting permission to perform in the very place that Henry VIII had once ruled England from.  Wakeman's request was denied, but some 35 years later in 2008, he was given permission to perform there.  The event which coincided with the 500th anniversary of Henry becoming the King of England, took place on May 2, 2009, and marked the first time that the six original compositions were played in a single performance, featuring extended versions of each piece.  Also included is ""Defender of the Faith"", a composition inspired by King Henry VIII, that Wakeman had originally intended to include on what became the Six Wives album, but due to the limits of what could fit on a vinyl record, the track had to be omitted.This performance at Hampton Court Palace, measures up in every way to the grandeur, style, and historical significance of the setting.  Joining Wakeman are the English Rock Ensemble, the Orchestra Europa conducted by Guy Protheroe, and the English Chamber Choir.  Actor Brian Blessed, provides dynamic introductions for most of the pieces.  Dressed in red and with his trademark flowing cape, Rick Wakeman plays nearly a dozen different keyboard instruments, in a tour de force performance.  Wakeman is dignified, focused, and serene, perhaps quite moved by the gravity of what has finally come to be.The show opens with the rousing ""Tudortune 1485"", followed by ""Catherine of Aragon"", the piece that launched Wakeman's career as a solo artist.  Next is the light and graceful ""Kathryn Howard"", which has a more colorful and emotional arrangement that gives the piece a wonderful new vibe.  For the eerie ""Jane Seymour"", Wakeman, dons a gold cape, and ascends an elevated platform in the center of the stage, to play a huge church organ located at the top.  Inspired by Henry VIII, the bold and jazzy ""Defender of the Faith"" prominently features the electric guitar matching leads with Wakeman's keys.""Catherine Parr"" is a colorful and very cool musical Odyssey.  The fast paced and dynamic, ""Anne of Cleves"" is the most rock based track on Six Wives, and this version which features inspired contributions from each musical component, it is definitely one of show's highlights.  ""Anne Boleyn"" is another far ranging musical journey, that pumps along to a steady groove.  The performance closes with the rousing ""Tudorock"", which incorporates various musical themes from Six Wives, and features Rick and his son Adam, who is also an accomplished keyboard player, both playing the ketar.  This piece is a fitting celebratory conclusion to what is a truly wonderful evening of music, and the realization of dream spanning decades.Suspended cameras provide some interesting views of the performance, although firmly fixated on the music, Rick does not play to the camera much.  The DVD also includes a beautiful 28 page booklet with photos, details about the performers, biographies of Henry VIII and his wives, and some of Rick's remembrances of the album, which was inspired by a book that he bought at an airport newsstand.This historic performance is a success on every level.  The music is majestic and impeccably played, with the orchestras and chorus smoothly integrated with Wakeman's band.  The resulting sound is huge and incredibly dynamic, perhaps even glorious at times.  This DVD is highly recommended to any fan of Six Wives, or Rick Wakeman's music.",5,"the realization of Rick Wakeman's dream of over thirty years, is a magnificent, magical, musical event...",1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,4237,"['performance', 'historic', 'Hampton', 'Court', 'Palace', 'fulfillment', 'dream', 'keyboardist', 'extraordinaire', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'concert', 'epic', 'scale', 'majestically', 'staged', 'rich', 'sounds', 'historically', 'significant', 'music', 'performed', 'dignity', 'emotion', 'skill', 'truly', 'bringing', 'life', 'compositions', 'Wakeman', 'groundbreaking', 'concept', 'album', 'Six', 'Wives', 'Henry', 'VIII', '1973', '.Rick', 'Wakeman', 'gained', 'attention', 'member', 'Strawbs', 'Yes', 'huge', 'success', 'achieved', 'albumFragile', 'lead', 'opportunity', 'Wakeman', 'do', 'solo', 'record', 'eventually', 'became', 'Six', 'Wives', 'album', 'contained', 'six', 'instrumental', 'tracks', 'music', 'being', 'inspired', 'Wakeman', 'perception', 'life', 'personality', 'Henry', 'spouses.In', '1973', 'Wakeman', 'wrote', 'letter', 'charge', 'Hampton', 'Court', 'Palace', 'requesting', 'permission', 'perform', 'very', 'place', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'had', 'once', 'ruled', 'England', 'Wakeman', 'request', 'was', 'denied', '35', 'years', 'later', '2008', 'was', 'given', 'permission', 'perform', 'there', 'event', 'coincided', '500th', 'anniversary', 'Henry', 'becoming', 'King', 'England', 'took', 'place', 'May', '2', '2009', 'marked', 'first', 'time', 'six', 'original', 'compositions', 'were', 'played', 'single', 'performance', 'featuring', 'extended', 'versions', 'piece', 'Also', 'included', 'Defender', 'Faith', 'composition', 'inspired', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Wakeman', 'had', 'originally', 'intended', 'include', 'became', 'Six', 'Wives', 'album', 'due', 'limits', 'what', 'could', 'fit', 'vinyl', 'record', 'track', 'had', 'be', 'omitted.This', 'performance', 'Hampton', 'Court', 'Palace', 'up', 'way', 'grandeur', 'style', 'historical', 'significance', 'setting', 'Joining', 'Wakeman', 'are', 'English', 'Rock', 'Ensemble', 'Orchestra', 'Europa', 'conducted', 'Guy', 'Protheroe', 'English', 'Chamber', 'Choir', 'Actor', 'Brian', 'Blessed', 'dynamic', 'introductions', 'most', 'pieces', 'Dressed', 'red', 'trademark', 'flowing', 'cape', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'nearly', 'dozen', 'different', 'keyboard', 'instruments', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'Wakeman', 'dignified', 'focused', 'serene', 'perhaps', 'quite', 'moved', 'gravity', 'what', 'finally', 'come', 'be.The', 'show', 'rousing', 'Tudortune', '1485', 'followed', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'piece', 'launched', 'Wakeman', 'career', 'solo', 'artist', 'Next', 'light', 'graceful', 'Kathryn', 'Howard', 'more', 'colorful', 'emotional', 'arrangement', 'piece', 'wonderful', 'new', 'vibe', 'eerie', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Wakeman', 'gold', 'cape', 'elevated', 'platform', 'center', 'stage', 'play', 'huge', 'church', 'organ', 'located', 'top', 'Inspired', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'bold', 'jazzy', 'Defender', 'Faith', 'prominently', 'electric', 'guitar', 'matching', 'leads', 'Wakeman', 'keys', 'Catherine', 'Parr', 'colorful', 'very', 'cool', 'musical', 'Odyssey', 'fast', 'paced', 'dynamic', 'Anne', 'Cleves', 'most', 'rock', 'based', 'track', 'Six', 'Wives', 'version', 'inspired', 'contributions', 'musical', 'component', 'definitely', 'one', 'show', 'highlights', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'far', 'ranging', 'musical', 'journey', 'along', 'steady', 'groove', 'performance', 'rousing', 'Tudorock', 'various', 'musical', 'themes', 'Six', 'Wives', 'features', 'Rick', 'son', 'Adam', 'who', 'also', 'accomplished', 'keyboard', 'player', 'playing', 'ketar', 'piece', 'fitting', 'celebratory', 'conclusion', 'what', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'evening', 'music', 'realization', 'dream', 'spanning', 'decades.Suspended', 'cameras', 'provide', 'interesting', 'views', 'performance', 'firmly', 'fixated', 'music', 'Rick', 'not', 'play', 'camera', 'much', 'DVD', 'also', 'beautiful', '28', 'page', 'booklet', 'photos', 'details', 'performers', 'biographies', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'wives', 'Rick', 'remembrances', 'album', 'was', 'inspired', 'book', 'bought', 'airport', 'newsstand.This', 'historic', 'performance', 'success', 'level', 'music', 'majestic', 'impeccably', 'played', 'orchestras', 'chorus', 'smoothly', 'integrated', 'Wakeman', 'band', 'resulting', 'sound', 'huge', 'incredibly', 'dynamic', 'perhaps', 'even', 'glorious', 'times', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fan', 'Six', 'Wives', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'music']",N/A
