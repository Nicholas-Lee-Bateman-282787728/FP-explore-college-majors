1265693,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,B002EWD0BI,atmj,"[6, 7]","A rank beginner, both in yoga and in exercise videos, this DVD gave me exactly what I expected and needed.I have attended 16 or so yoga classes prior to this video, so I at least knew some of the moves.  A few were new to me.  But, the video covered them in enough detail to do them even if you did not.I found the best way to approach using a video, as this was my first time, was to watch the video through once and then the second time, do the routines.  Initially it was fast, but later when you know the routines, it is the perfect length.One issue I had is with the breathing. The duration between breaths that the instructor said to take and what I needed to take, was not in sync. Maybe when I get better, I won't be gasping quite so much.  Not sure if this is a common thing or not. Suspect it is more of a conditioning thing.I'm an overweight woman in my 50s and to go from downward dog to warrier pose, is not as gracefully as the yoga instructor shows.  However, I get there my way and this video works for me.  I was drenched halfway through and had to towel my face off.  Anyone that does not think yoga is not strenuous has not done it. The chair, table and superman pose and the warrior dance (variations on the warrior poses), are one heck of a work out.Having read complaints about the intro, I don't get the big deal.  Subsequent plays did not even bring it up.Can't tell you yet if you lose weight from this, but after I use it awhile I will repost.AN UPDATE:Having purchased even more videos, this one really stands out. It is one complete workout that I can do. As I said I am overweight. I also, have issues with my knees and really rigid ankles and feet, but, I can do all of this workout. I can't say that about other workouts. There are some other beginner videos that have kneeling poses, or some more extreme poses (despite their beginner label) that I just can't do.  Additionally, the pace is reasonable.  She keeps you moving and working out.  Some other videos had one convoluted pose after another, that though I have been through the video 2-3 times, I can't quite get, nor keep up with.  This is a keeper and one heck of a workout.",5,"Wow, do you work up a sweat!",1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,2166,"['rank', 'beginner', 'yoga', 'exercise', 'videos', 'DVD', 'gave', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'needed.I', 'have', 'attended', '16', 'so', 'yoga', 'classes', 'prior', 'video', 'so', 'least', 'knew', 'moves', 'few', 'were', 'new', 'video', 'covered', 'enough', 'detail', 'do', 'even', 'did', 'not.I', 'found', 'best', 'way', 'approach', 'using', 'video', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'watch', 'video', 'once', 'then', 'second', 'time', 'do', 'routines', 'Initially', 'was', 'fast', 'later', 'when', 'know', 'routines', 'perfect', 'length.One', 'issue', 'had', 'breathing', 'duration', 'breaths', 'instructor', 'said', 'take', 'what', 'needed', 'take', 'was', 'not', 'sync', 'Maybe', 'when', 'get', 'better', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'gasping', 'quite', 'so', 'much', 'Not', 'sure', 'common', 'thing', 'not', 'Suspect', 'more', 'conditioning', 'thing.I', ""'m"", 'overweight', 'woman', '50s', 'go', 'downward', 'dog', 'warrier', 'pose', 'not', 'as', 'gracefully', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'shows', 'However', 'get', 'way', 'video', 'was', 'drenched', 'halfway', 'had', 'towel', 'face', 'Anyone', 'not', 'think', 'yoga', 'not', 'strenuous', 'not', 'done', 'chair', 'table', 'superman', 'pose', 'warrior', 'dance', 'variations', 'warrior', 'poses', 'are', 'one', 'heck', 'work', 'out.Having', 'read', 'complaints', 'intro', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'big', 'deal', 'Subsequent', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'bring', 'up.Ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'yet', 'lose', 'weight', 'use', 'will', 'repost.AN', 'UPDATE', 'Having', 'purchased', 'even', 'more', 'videos', 'one', 'really', 'out', 'one', 'complete', 'can', 'do', 'said', 'am', 'overweight', 'also', 'have', 'issues', 'knees', 'really', 'rigid', 'ankles', 'feet', 'can', 'do', 'workout', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'other', 'workouts', 'are', 'other', 'beginner', 'videos', 'have', 'kneeling', 'poses', 'more', 'extreme', 'poses', 'beginner', 'label', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'Additionally', 'pace', 'reasonable', 'moving', 'working', 'out', 'other', 'videos', 'had', 'one', 'convoluted', 'pose', 'have', 'been', 'video', '2-3', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'keep', 'up', 'keeper', 'one', 'heck', 'workout']",Element: Yoga for Weight Loss

1265697,A2VREJW7HAWVUQ,B002EWD0BI,"Elizabeth Haynes ""Writer""","[5, 9]","I was disappointed.  I quit after 30 minutes.  :(  It was very challenging, but it was also really boring to me.  And I didn't feel like I was flowing the way I do with some other DVDs.The poses felt repetitive, mostly focusing on using the leg muscles or doing some version of push-up pose.  I was missing stretching and lengthening poses, and balancing.  And honestly I slightly pulled a muscle in my side during this practice, and I'm very physically fit (I'm a dancer, I do yoga, and I also do other forms of cardio).  It was during the dancing warrior segment, and I've done dancing warrior no problem before with Shiva Rea's practices.  I wasn't warmed up or stretched out enough to do boat pose either by the time I got there.  All in all I was really disappointed.I do think it's nicely shot, and challenging, and good if you like to hold poses for long periods and repeat them.  If you like faster moving flows that use more of your whole body, and you want to feel stretched out, then maybe this program isn't for you.  I fast forwarded a bit to see if there was anything coming up that would be different, but I found more of the same.  So I can't say how the very end went.Something I thought was weird:  I don't usually take 2-3 steps from downward dog to get to forward bend, nor do I take steps to get into push-up pose from forward bend.  She also spent a lot of time explaining, which is good for the beginner but too much for me.  But yet at the same time, I can see this being way too hard for a beginner.

1265700,A1CCW4DLR2BPWA,B002EWD0BI,Happy Hiker,"[1, 1]","I have many yoga DVDs as well as most of the Element DVDs.  This yoga DVD has many positives.Instructor:  Ashley Turner is great.  It's done voice over style, which I prefer.  Her instruction is so clear, that you rarely have to look to see what she's doing. Her narration is also on time with her movements, unlike some DVDs.  Her voice is soft and soothing.  One of the things I like about her instruction is that she's very positive in her comments, not just instructing on what to do, but also what to think, as in ""think about your goals."" She says she has a master's in psychology, and it shows.  I'd like her to do more than two Element DVDs she's done because her comments are so positive.Set:  It's filmed outdoors in a beautiful garden with an ocean setting.Music:  It's not ""yoga"" music, but it's instrumental and nice.  The tempo changes with the actions.Level:  This is done well enough that beginners could follow along easily.  I think beginners to lower level intermediates will like it.  Those with an advanced practice will be bored.  However, this is one of those that's nice for days when you don't feel like doing much.  That said, it can be challenging if you're out of shape or recovering from an injury and you lack muscle strength and endurance.  These are easy poses, and the instructor is very good about telling you how to get in and out of them. The most advanced is bow pose (dhanurasana). It's a nice choice for those getting over injuries, as I am.  She's good about indicating how to modify for neck, shoulder, back and knee issues.Production values: Excellent sound, filming, views, etc.Overall, it's a nice beginner or light yoga DVD.  Its greatest strength is the positive messages from the instructor since there are many DVDs out there for beginners and filmed outside.  It's not one I'll do often, but it's nice to have around when I want to move but am feeling low on energy and need some positive energy.  I have many to choose from and I can see myself pulling this out on a cold winter day when I'm feeling blah and need a breath of fresh air to get me going.  It also leaves me feeling loosened up and relaxed.As for the weight loss part, it seems that the mind/body connection is what comes into play. You'll burn more calories doing power yoga or by exercising.  However, this yoga DVD is good about getting one to connect how the body feels with the mind.  Many people have a disconnect between their brains and bodies, and a DVD like this could be very good for someone who needs to lose weight and doesn't have body awareness.  I've seen people lose weight through yoga not because of the physical exertion, but because yoga helps them to appreciate their bodies, and from there, they start making better food choices and/or feel good enough to exercise.",5,Positive yoga in a beautiful garden,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,2803,"['have', 'many', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'Element', 'DVDs', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'many', 'positives.Instructor', 'Ashley', 'Turner', 'great', 'done', 'voice', 'style', 'prefer', 'instruction', 'so', 'clear', 'rarely', 'have', 'look', 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'narration', 'also', 'time', 'movements', 'DVDs', 'voice', 'soft', 'soothing', 'One', 'things', 'like', 'instruction', 'very', 'positive', 'comments', 'not', 'just', 'instructing', 'what', 'do', 'also', 'what', 'think', 'think', 'goals', 'master', 'psychology', ""'d"", 'like', 'do', 'more', 'two', 'Element', 'DVDs', 'done', 'comments', 'are', 'so', 'positive.Set', 'filmed', 'outdoors', 'beautiful', 'garden', 'ocean', 'setting.Music', 'not', 'yoga', 'music', 'instrumental', 'nice', 'tempo', 'changes', 'actions.Level', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'beginners', 'could', 'follow', 'along', 'easily', 'think', 'beginners', 'lower', 'level', 'intermediates', 'will', 'like', 'advanced', 'practice', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'However', 'one', 'nice', 'days', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'doing', 'much', 'said', 'can', 'be', 'challenging', ""'re"", 'shape', 'recovering', 'injury', 'lack', 'muscle', 'strength', 'endurance', 'are', 'easy', 'poses', 'instructor', 'very', 'good', 'telling', 'how', 'get', 'most', 'advanced', 'bow', 'pose', 'dhanurasana', 'nice', 'choice', 'getting', 'injuries', 'am', 'good', 'indicating', 'how', 'modify', 'neck', 'shoulder', 'back', 'knee', 'issues.Production', 'values', 'Excellent', 'sound', 'filming', 'views', 'etc.Overall', 'nice', 'beginner', 'light', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'greatest', 'strength', 'positive', 'messages', 'instructor', 'are', 'many', 'DVDs', 'there', 'beginners', 'filmed', 'outside', 'not', 'one', ""'ll"", 'do', 'often', 'nice', 'have', 'around', 'when', 'want', 'move', 'am', 'feeling', 'low', 'energy', 'need', 'positive', 'energy', 'have', 'many', 'choose', 'can', 'see', 'pulling', 'out', 'cold', 'winter', 'day', 'when', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'blah', 'need', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'get', 'going', 'also', 'feeling', 'loosened', 'up', 'relaxed.As', 'weight', 'loss', 'part', 'mind/body', 'connection', 'what', 'play', ""'ll"", 'burn', 'more', 'calories', 'doing', 'power', 'yoga', 'exercising', 'However', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'good', 'getting', 'one', 'connect', 'how', 'body', 'mind', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'disconnect', 'brains', 'bodies', 'DVD', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'someone', 'who', 'lose', 'weight', ""n't"", 'have', 'body', 'awareness', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'people', 'lose', 'weight', 'yoga', 'not', 'physical', 'exertion', 'yoga', 'appreciate', 'bodies', 'there', 'start', 'making', 'better', 'food', 'choices', 'and/or', 'feel', 'good', 'enough', 'exercise']",Element: Yoga for Weight Loss

Ritchie,"[19, 23]","Unfortunately, I cannot review this program from the perspective of a true yoga expert...honestly, when I bought this DVD, I was just interested in adding some new life to my old workout routine.  I was also interested in learning about yoga, rather than the ""yoga-based"" workouts that I'd done in the past, but that still came second on the priority list.  Anyway, I am absolutely blown away by Element: Yoga for Weight Loss!  This program has now taken the place of all other DVDs that were once in my rotation (although I still do a separate cardio routine).  The instructor is fantastically knowledgeable and encouraging and gives prompts right on time.  The workout is challenging and SO rewarding; it is truly a full-body blast.  Also, there are enough modifications presented that I feel as though I have plenty of room to grow with this routine.  Yoga for Weight Loss is something that I actually look forward to doing everyday--I seriously can't wait to do it!Now, I am a mom of four little boys, so I really have to MAKE THE TIME to work out (no snacks for 45 minutes, people, don't even ask--that's the rule!), but my kids really love this routine, too.  They are always trying to keep up, which makes for great comedy--but more importantly, it makes me feel good to see them taking an interest in such a wonderful practice.  As for results, after one month of performing this workout for an average of 4 times a week, I can see some positive changes in my body; I've noticed some increased muscle definition and I am slowly seeing an increase in my flexibility, but--and I never thought I'd say this due to my inclination to work out for vanity's sake--what is more impressive to me is how I FEEL now.  I am so much more relaxed in my daily life.  Now that I have been so inspired by this practice, I have started to read up on the tradition of yoga so that I can hopefully grow and truly appreciate the history and methodology in its entirety; I realize even scratching the surface is a lofty goal, but I'm going to have a go at it!

Several times during the workout I felt like giving up, but I find that the instructor never pushes you TOO hard--which is good. Right when you feel like you're about to break, or rather your thigh muscles are about to explode, she gives you a big, well-deserved stretch.
