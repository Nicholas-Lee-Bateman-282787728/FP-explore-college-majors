The chemistry between Bixby and Cruz are really what make this show such a treat.

1497924,A2NGPPSF1GQFNU,B005R2SHX8,James,"[1, 2]","A touching, heart-warming and funny show!Bill Bixby & Brandon Cruz had an excellent show with ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father.""  Often, at the beginning and very end of episodes, there is a cute ""Father & Son moment"" where Eddie will come up with an off-the-wall or kids-curiosity question or comment. These are golden moments and its a joy to watch the episodes just for these. But the episodes/plots themselves are also fun. There are some good lessons in effective communication throughout this series. Bill Bixby had a very good knack for getting through to people, in a good way.  A great family show.

Thank God that I am able to obtain many of the television programs on DVD that I thought were long gone. I grew up with Bill Bixby on My Favorite Martian, The Hulk and countless other shows he had appeared on throughout his career, And this is one that I would always remember fondly. So once I saw that it was on DVD I had to have it. Once I have seen every episode I will get season 2. It was the best friend concept between a father and son that I would from time to time draw from in the raising of my own 3 children. You win some you loose some, but if you don't try you win none and lose all! And these shows gave me a blueprint that I would try and model myself after because their message was motivated by love and there was always a lesson to be learned and to draw from.For this I thank all involved and all who made it possible that I could have it for my very own.",5,"It is so, so good to see this again.",1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,924,"['grew', 'up', 'Courtship', 'Eddie', 'father', 'Thank', 'God', 'am', 'able', 'obtain', 'many', 'television', 'programs', 'DVD', 'thought', 'were', 'long', 'gone', 'grew', 'up', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Martian', 'Hulk', 'countless', 'other', 'had', 'appeared', 'career', 'one', 'would', 'always', 'remember', 'fondly', 'So', 'once', 'saw', 'was', 'DVD', 'had', 'have', 'Once', 'have', 'seen', 'episode', 'will', 'get', 'season', '2', 'was', 'best', 'friend', 'concept', 'father', 'son', 'would', 'time', 'time', 'draw', 'raising', 'own', '3', 'children', 'win', 'loose', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'win', 'none', 'lose', 'shows', 'gave', 'blueprint', 'would', 'try', 'model', 'message', 'was', 'motivated', 'love', 'was', 'always', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'draw', 'from.For', 'thank', 'involved', 'who', 'made', 'possible', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'own']",The Courtship of Eddie's Father: Season 1
