Primavera ""Real Deal""","[0, 0]","reading the watcher reveiws almost scared me away from this movie but the girlfriend loves christian slater.Anyway the movie is great to watch as a couple, it has some action with some suspense and romantic humor.There were a few minor twists but overall the progression of the movie is fairly predictable.  Even so it was very entertaining to watch and I didn't find myself bored at any point in time.For the used price of under $10.00 its more than worth it.",5,"Very Underated Movie, A Gem in the rough",1280620800,"08 1, 2010",2010,460,"['reading', 'watcher', 'reveiws', 'almost', 'scared', 'away', 'movie', 'girlfriend', 'christian', 'slater.Anyway', 'movie', 'great', 'watch', 'couple', 'action', 'suspense', 'romantic', 'humor.There', 'were', 'few', 'minor', 'twists', 'progression', 'movie', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'Even', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'bored', 'point', 'time.For', 'used', 'price', '10.00', 'more']",N/A

Unfortunately, from beginning to end things keep ticking away at making this a recommendation and/or a re-watchable film.The story follows a best selling author as he is mysteriously lied to from everyone that surrounds him (fiancee, lawyer, new girlfriend, etc.) then unwittingly gets swept into the criminal world to fix these ""lies and illusions"". Christian Slater plays the writer, Cuba Gooding plays the bad guy boss, and the two fighting gals are played by B movie queens Christa Campbell and Sarah Ann Schultz.Truly, everything about this film as it transpires makes you want to turn it off, from the corny writing (if Slater said that stupid line of ""I am just a writer"" one more time above the 10 others I would have had to call it quits), cheesy situations, jittery camera work that blurs each action scene (the effect of hiding not really doing the stunts and low speed contact), bad editing (the voices blatantly mismatch the mouth(s) in well over 30 different scenes), but mostly the horrible fight choreography. The movie was being sold in the ads as having the cool fight sequence between the two ladies, but their bar kick fight scene was so poorly done, it felt hollow. Screening the film in store actually lost rentals as customers were immediately turned off by the bad camera work and cheesy fighting. The camera jitter was so bad in one of the lawyer office scenes it actually felt like the camera was bumped and dropped.The Blu quality was not given any treatment and the resulting low grade feel gave it a reference right to a B film (non Blu preservation). This kind of work has unfortunately plummeted Cuba's sale and rental status with those last few films; this did not help. The supplement is an 11 minute making-of that contained more footage from the movie than it did relevant interview/background material. Can only recommend as a rental when you are in the mood for what has come to be expected from this crew. Hope you get something more out of it.",2,"Poor movie, below average Blu",1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,2111,"['Was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'sleeper', 'ad', 'campaign', 'been', 'full', 'swing', 'poster', 'placements', 'distributor', 'plugs', 'so', 'Unfortunately', 'beginning', 'end', 'things', 'keep', 'ticking', 'away', 'making', 'recommendation', 're-watchable', 'film.The', 'story', 'best', 'selling', 'author', 'mysteriously', 'lied', 'everyone', 'fiancee', 'lawyer', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'etc', 'then', 'unwittingly', 'swept', 'criminal', 'world', 'fix', 'lies', 'illusions', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'writer', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'bad', 'guy', 'boss', 'two', 'fighting', 'gals', 'are', 'played', 'B', 'movie', 'Christa', 'Campbell', 'Sarah', 'Ann', 'Schultz.Truly', 'everything', 'film', 'want', 'turn', 'off', 'corny', 'writing', 'Slater', 'said', 'stupid', 'line', 'am', 'just', 'writer', 'one', 'more', 'time', '10', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'call', 'cheesy', 'situations', 'jittery', 'camera', 'work', 'action', 'scene', 'effect', 'hiding', 'not', 'really', 'doing', 'stunts', 'low', 'speed', 'contact', 'bad', 'editing', 'voices', 'blatantly', 'mismatch', 'mouth', 's', 'well', '30', 'different', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'horrible', 'fight', 'choreography', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'sold', 'ads', 'having', 'cool', 'fight', 'sequence', 'two', 'ladies', 'bar', 'kick', 'fight', 'scene', 'was', 'so', 'poorly', 'done', 'felt', 'hollow', 'Screening', 'film', 'store', 'actually', 'lost', 'rentals', 'customers', 'were', 'immediately', 'turned', 'off', 'bad', 'camera', 'work', 'cheesy', 'fighting', 'camera', 'jitter', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'one', 'lawyer', 'office', 'actually', 'felt', 'camera', 'was', 'bumped', 'dropped.The', 'Blu', 'quality', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'treatment', 'resulting', 'low', 'grade', 'feel', 'gave', 'reference', 'right', 'B', 'film', 'non', 'Blu', 'preservation', 'kind', 'work', 'unfortunately', 'plummeted', 'Cuba', 'sale', 'rental', 'status', 'last', 'few', 'films', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'supplement', '11', 'minute', 'making-of', 'contained', 'more', 'footage', 'movie', 'did', 'relevant', 'interview/background', 'material', 'Can', 'only', 'recommend', 'rental', 'when', 'are', 'mood', 'what', 'come', 'be', 'expected', 'crew', 'Hope', 'get', 'something', 'more']",N/A
