936574,AUJFO0J9A2HGE,B000B6CO5C,Alcee Arobin,"[5, 6]","I think that many of the reviewers of this film contradict themselves.  They degrade it as unnecessarily complicated and yet further degrade it as empty, lacking the depth of its aspirations.  One reviewer compares it to Shakespeare.  Why?  Most assume that if a film is to do something as bold and intricate as welcome its entire dialog into iambic pentameter then the director, in her annoyingly avant-garde quest, must fashion some otherworldly vision, something that will ""change the way movies are made!"", as they say.  And YES, I agree, some of the rhymes do fall flat (the reviewer from Japan mentioned the surgical reference), but as I saw it, the rhyming was merely a vehicle to give this lush film a refined elegance and the will to take heart with elements of the fantastic.  And why are we so hesitant to allow or accept such a thing?  What would have made the surgical reference more acceptable had it been said in prose?  Moreover, why don't we all walk around speaking in a sly, well thought-out rhyming pattern?  It would be difficult, and would limit our ability to communicate, but then, aren't the most important things those that don't need to be said, or rather can't?  What if when speaking to our lover we spoke only in a delicately chartered melody and relied simply on our ability to feel and understand one another to leave the rest unsaid?  Language is utterly unimportant, it gets in the way.  If people used their feelings more than their mouths I suspect unhappiness would not be as widespread.  Take the scene in the film when She demands that her husband argue with her, and he correctly queries as to the point.  They know the way they feel, and words, no matter how heated or infused with passion, could never express what needs to felt, not heard.  And yet, even our characters understand this.  For them, language is like a prison, a way of ""talking everything away.""  She does this for a living, attempting to convince through vocal complexities the many reasons why abortion is not murder, why God does not exist.  But remember, this is only what She says, when we hear her thoughts we know she converses with God and begs Him to forgive her for not believing in Him, for playing scientist with cells and organic matter and attempting in her vast loneliness to ""penetrate the mind of God.""  And so, if language is a prison, why not make it beautiful?  Why not adorn it with intricacies so that only that which must be said is said?  Again the characters understand this.  In their confrontation in the parking garage, He asks She how many words in Arabic she can speak, then asking her if she understands the difficulty it takes for a nonnative speaker of English to constantly seek out the rhyming of words, thus admitting that not only do they recognize their odd pattern, but that in his love for her, he battles the very will of language so that what he must say to her is said.  They understand their prison.  It is words and thoughts that keep them apart, their hearts usher them into the arms of one another.I'm fully aware that I'm looking deeper than the film requires, but I could just as easily use it as a vehicle to ask in the same manner as I do of why we all don't speak in rhymes, ""Why do we hate and hurt one another?""...""Why do we die in wonderment of who's God is King?""  The film asks these things.  His quest to remain pure to his faith threatens to break them apart, yet in the end they both seemingly realize that regardless of God's preference, He has marred them both with the same loneliness, with the same need for one another.  And so if as the film argues, it is true that the word ""No"" does not exist nor has it ever, when these two lovers look to Heaven and ask of God is it possible that they be together and truly love one another unconditionally and unapologetically without incurring His wrath, then His only response could be...",5,"A Beautiful, SHAMELESSLY Arthouse Film",1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,3902,"['think', 'many', 'reviewers', 'film', 'contradict', 'degrade', 'unnecessarily', 'complicated', 'yet', 'further', 'degrade', 'empty', 'lacking', 'depth', 'aspirations', 'One', 'reviewer', 'Shakespeare', 'Why', 'Most', 'assume', 'film', 'do', 'something', 'bold', 'intricate', 'welcome', 'entire', 'dialog', 'iambic', 'pentameter', 'then', 'director', 'annoyingly', 'avant-garde', 'quest', 'must', 'fashion', 'otherworldly', 'vision', 'something', 'will', 'change', 'way', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'say', 'YES', 'agree', 'rhymes', 'do', 'fall', 'flat', 'reviewer', 'Japan', 'mentioned', 'surgical', 'reference', 'saw', 'rhyming', 'was', 'merely', 'vehicle', 'give', 'lush', 'film', 'refined', 'elegance', 'will', 'take', 'heart', 'elements', 'fantastic', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'hesitant', 'allow', 'accept', 'such', 'thing', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'surgical', 'reference', 'more', 'acceptable', 'had', 'been', 'said', 'prose', 'Moreover', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'speaking', 'sly', 'well', 'rhyming', 'pattern', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'would', 'limit', 'ability', 'communicate', 'then', 'are', ""n't"", 'most', 'important', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'said', 'rather', 'ca', ""n't"", 'What', 'when', 'speaking', 'lover', 'spoke', 'only', 'delicately', 'chartered', 'melody', 'relied', 'simply', 'ability', 'feel', 'understand', 'one', 'leave', 'rest', 'unsaid', 'Language', 'utterly', 'unimportant', 'way', 'people', 'used', 'feelings', 'more', 'mouths', 'suspect', 'unhappiness', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'widespread', 'Take', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'husband', 'argue', 'correctly', 'point', 'know', 'way', 'feel', 'words', 'matter', 'how', 'heated', 'infused', 'passion', 'could', 'never', 'express', 'what', 'felt', 'not', 'heard', 'yet', 'even', 'characters', 'understand', 'language', 'prison', 'way', 'talking', 'everything', 'away', 'living', 'attempting', 'convince', 'vocal', 'complexities', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'abortion', 'not', 'murder', 'why', 'God', 'not', 'exist', 'remember', 'only', 'what', 'when', 'hear', 'thoughts', 'know', 'God', 'begs', 'Him', 'forgive', 'not', 'believing', 'Him', 'playing', 'scientist', 'cells', 'organic', 'matter', 'attempting', 'vast', 'loneliness', 'penetrate', 'mind', 'God', 'so', 'language', 'prison', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'beautiful', 'Why', 'not', 'adorn', 'intricacies', 'so', 'only', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'said', 'Again', 'characters', 'understand', 'confrontation', 'parking', 'garage', 'how', 'many', 'words', 'Arabic', 'can', 'speak', 'then', 'asking', 'difficulty', 'nonnative', 'speaker', 'English', 'constantly', 'seek', 'out', 'rhyming', 'words', 'thus', 'admitting', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'recognize', 'odd', 'pattern', 'love', 'very', 'will', 'language', 'so', 'what', 'must', 'say', 'said', 'understand', 'prison', 'words', 'thoughts', 'keep', 'apart', 'hearts', 'arms', 'one', 'another.I', ""'m"", 'fully', 'aware', ""'m"", 'looking', 'deeper', 'film', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'use', 'vehicle', 'ask', 'same', 'manner', 'do', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'rhymes', 'Why', 'do', 'hate', 'hurt', 'one', 'Why', 'do', 'die', 'wonderment', 'who', 'God', 'King', 'film', 'things', 'quest', 'remain', 'pure', 'faith', 'break', 'apart', 'yet', 'end', 'seemingly', 'realize', 'regardless', 'God', 'preference', 'marred', 'same', 'loneliness', 'same', 'need', 'one', 'so', 'film', 'true', 'word', 'No', 'not', 'exist', 'ever', 'when', 'two', 'lovers', 'look', 'Heaven', 'ask', 'God', 'possible', 'be', 'together', 'truly', 'love', 'one', 'unconditionally', 'unapologetically', 'incurring', 'wrath', 'then', 'only', 'response', 'could', 'be']",Yes

936577,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B000B6CO5C,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[0, 0]","This erotic fantasy, ""Yes"", one with lots of bared skin but nothing close to full nudity (no outright full dorsal or frontal nakedness), is a bit patchy. Simon Abkarian is a sleekly lean, handsome, and well-made man, so it is worth seeing as much, literally, of him as one can! His slyly affectionate gallantries endear him to viewers as they so do, obviously, to the lady who benefits from his amourous attentions. At its best, the first part of the film when the couple is getting ever closer to each other in intimacy, there is a wonderful dreamlike quality, which the lilt of the poetic verses in which the characters (they and others in the film) converse carries one along drifting on the lyricism of the screenplay.When ""love goes bad"", however, the film seems unconvincingly motivated. The lovers have, for awhile, irreconcilable cultural antagonism that their affair really does not seem to justify except in barren stereotypes. Thus the temporary rupture between them (which, along with losing his job in the U.K., results in the man's return to Beyrouth, in his native Lebanon) seems too contrived to be more naturally convincing. Not to worry, though, the lovers reconcile, on (for them) the neutral turf of Cuba and all ends hopefully (or so, at least, it seems) for this pair, from what I could grasp of the film. There are subsidiary characters and narratives in the movie which other reviewers on Amazon's various national WWW sites describe in their own reviews, so I shall not delve into them here.It would have helped enormously if there had been English subtitles. I am becoming somewhat hard of hearing and there was much of the dialogue that simply did not register on my ears. There are French subtitles (in, at any rate, the North American edition that I acquired, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment 10906, in the series, ""Sony Pictures Classics""), but this film so strives (intermittently successfully and short of that) for a literary effect in English that seeing and understanding the original text along with the images really would count for much.

936578,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000B6CO5C,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","YES is film you want to love and most people who watch it probably know they are in for a Sally Potter ride, so little quirks like an iambic pentameter script shouldn't shock. There are so many gorgeous moments in this lushly painted canvas, so many isolated portions of dialog that are thought-provoking or just simply beautiful English poetry, so many scenes that are in the capable hands of Joan Allen and Simon Abkarian that are among the finest depictions of understated passion - that it is a shame the overall effect of the montages is not wholly successful. And I think the lack of cohesion must be returned to the capable but distracted hands of Potter's script and direction.Joan Allen (who simply grows more beautiful and talented with every edgy Indie she takes on) is a biogeneticist, a woman whose loveless marriage to cold politician Sam Neill is tolerable only because of her infatuation with her work. At a (here is one of the choice visual pearls of perfection) formal dinner she notices and is noticed by a handsome Lebanese cook (Simon Abkarian) and her heart ignites. The two talk, meet again, and respond viscerally to each other in a degree of passion and need new to both. This union opens the platform for words concerning Catholicism/Western philosophy versus Islam/Eastern loathing for the imperialism of the Western world (read USA): it is the Muslim philosophy/secular West conflict that resounds so clearly in today's world. Other concepts bathed in iambic pentameter include marriage, fidelity, motherhood, racism, immigration, bickering among the kitchen staff where the cook works - all worthy topics. As the two glide along the plane of a sexual relationship the man reveals he is a surgeon/scientist who left his country because of philosophical reasons and yet defends his Muslim stance and homeland to the isolated woman who is unable to 'hear' his crumbled life. The woman has interchanges with her goddaughter (Stephanie Leonidas), her dying communist aunt (who in voice over technique relates some of the loveliest lines in the script) and with her husband who cannot find his center. The manner in which this all comes to an end is best left for the viewer to discover.The problems with Potter's jewel-like film are many: much of the dialog (some of which is simply terrible writing) is buried with excessively loud 'background' music (ranging from Satie to punk rock) but worse is enunciated so softly by the actors that it is indecipherable. Yes, Shakespeare wrote his plays in iambic pentameter, but not a word is lost in performances because the actors enunciate with perfect diction and allow the poetry to flow naturally, making it become simply dialogue of elegance. Potter's poetry is spotty, so perhaps it is as well that much of it is lost. When it works, it is stunning. Joan Allen is radiant in this role and gives us as defined a character as possible given the script limitations. Much the same can be said for Armenian actor Simon Abkarian. And despite the conflicts in their philosophies that threaten to crack the crystal of their affair, there is a true chemistry here. Some characters such as Shirley Henderson try very hard but simply swallow their lines in annoying and blurry accents.Sounds like a lot of negatives? Well, they are there, but for this viewer the piece still gives the same satisfaction as hearing a new symphonic work or viewing a form of visual art in progress. There is much beauty here, enough to beg forgiveness for the shortcomings.

936579,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000B6CO5C,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 3]","""YES"" is basically a gigantic poem. This is one of those efforts that can easily divide viewer's right down the middle and unless you're familiar with the director and into independent films in general this can be a challenging viewing experience. Story is set in London where we see a completely bored woman (Joan Allen known only as She) in a miserable marriage to an English politician (Sam Neill) and one night while at a dinner party she catches the eye of a restaurant cook. He (Simon Abkarian) is Lebanese and instantly starts to flirt with She and it doesn't take long before both of them are head on into an affair but the one thing that seems to stand in their way isn't her marriage but the difference in nationalities.These are characters dealing with life from opposite ends of the spectrum. While She examines sperm cells and eggs under a microscope, He, we later find, is a qualified surgeon from Beirut, now reduced to chopping meat in a restaurant. The couple's erotic and tempestuous affair examines cultural identity in post 9/11 London (significantly, filming started on 12th Sept 2001 and it was released shortly after the London bombings).Ultimately, it's a film about saying ""YES"" to life and how diversification adds poetic substance to our otherwise stale lives. Even the microscopes used by She to examine our multiplying and mutating genetic code have a life of their own, the lenses appearing as bulbous alien eyes under their dust mask covers. Dirt here is not something that can be swept away, but is regenerative and needs to be confronted. Images of cleaners occur throughout the film, frantically trying to clear up the emotional mess the characters leave in their wake.The camera work look like it was right out of film school and was a bit annoying. Granted some location photography was excellent....the colors and costume and locations obviously well thought out.  I really enjoyed Shirley Henderson, as the cleaner; who began and closed the movie I kept wishing that she had a bigger part in the movie.So, if you are a poem lover or an independent film lover, I'd recommend it.

936580,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000B6CO5C,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 5]","""...""Every now and then I bump into something astoundingly refreshing and exceptionally thoughtful that renders speechlessness within me.  Yes simply enters the screen visually and auditory, in a way, that sweeps the audience off their feet into a brilliant cinematic experience.  On occasion, it feels a little like the free spirited filmmaking of the French New Wave and Jean-Luc Godard's innovative film such as A Woman is a Woman (1961) and Masculin, F&eacute;minin (1966), and Tout va Bien (1972).  Yet, the director Sally Potter remains true to her own vision, as her visual feast is like nothing done before.  It is a sensible juxtaposition of past revolutionary cinema and succulently invigorating filmmaking of Potter that enters a contemporary society with all of its issues and dilemmas.Artistically, Potter presses present-day issues through an exceedingly antagonistic venture where the characters converge in daily drama and verse that in its length matches Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.  Amidst the poetic dialogues, the character's personas take shape through thoughts and actions while the words flow effortlessly like running water over a smooth rock.  Through clever cinematography and symbolic framing of the characters in the chosen environment Potter's presents strong notion that the crisis does not emerge through their conversations, but their actions, history, values, morals, and beliefs.  It is the moment when an action clashes with another individual's acquired cognitive disposition where a conflict arises despite moments of harmonious unity.The sound of a vacuum cleaner ignites the story, as the gray floating screen eventually displays microscopic dust mites and particles swerving in a chaotic manner to aerial pull until it is turned off.  Symbolically, the opening suggests the notion of Newton's Laws of motion (inertia, dynamics, and reciprocal actions), which Potter is about to apply to human beings in their way of interacting in the story.  The bigger question is who pushed the on and off button on the vacuum cleaner, as it is never displayed on the screen.  This might reveal a philosophically spiritual question, as it hints towards the idea of divine intervention.  Nonetheless, the audience will assume it is the cleaner (Shirley Henderson) who delivers an analogously existential debate through her cleaning, which she refers to as an illusion.  This is a mere three minutes into the film, but Potter has successfully indicated her intentional direction with the story.  It will deal with people and their interactions while their experiences and knowledge will help color their existence.The main character, the scientist She (Joan Allen) is married to the politician Anthony (Sam Neill) that together offer a symbolic idea of who is in control of the power.  The relationship is strained to the ultimate point; as Anthony has cheated on her while he squelches her objections with complete emotional control.  In retrospect, there is more than this in the scene; She knows, but Anthony controls.  A thought of this should be considered in regards to the nations and who govern the people.  Yet, when She thinks there is no hope, He (Simon Abkarian) appears like a subtle breeze on a late summer eve with tender words she has not heard in many years.She and He enter a passionate love affair, as she does not receive the love that a living organism desires and he has no one to embrace in his lonely arms.  Through She and He, whose names might be a spiritual reference to the beginning of mankind, the audience gets to explore the collision of opposite issues - rich and poor, man and woman, togetherness and loneliness, knowledge and ignorance, youth and elderly, nurture and nature, love and hate, care and neglect, servant and ruler, and death and life.  It is within these overlapping moments where Potter strings up an intriguing love story across borders, as She is an Irish Catholic while He is an Arabic Muslim that together face the social inertia of prejudice and narrow-mindedness.Yes presents a heavy viewing that requires, maybe more than one screening, as it provides strong social contrasting through the characters in the film.  The camerawork shows signs of perfection, as it does not intend to be perfect in the way it points out the human imperfections.  The use of surveillance cameras and other visually technical approaches enhances the cinematic moment together with the stunning mise-en-scene.  For example, the supper scene between She and Anthony brings to mind the meeting between two adversaries that cannot settle on peace.  The color tones also accentuate the mood of the scene whether it is passionate, or detached.  Potter has truly committed herself to cross borders into a place where everyone will find something offensive.  However, it is her intention, as she desires the audience to experience the same journey that He and She do, as they seek happiness and unity.In the end, Potter shows the audience that film is not simply a sequence of lines memorized by actors set in a probable environment, but an artistic journey that possess myriads of possibilities.  It is within these possibilities where the audience will uncover a true contemporary gem that will leave the audience dumbfounded, as contemplation seizes its grip over the

936581,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,B000B6CO5C,"O. Brown ""Ms. O. Khannah-Brown""","[13, 18]","****YES is not your stereotypical movie.  What an understatement!  It is written in iambic pentameter (a style of poetry) and is, I suppose, a film that will most appeal to those of us who are intellectuals and literate...however...I STILL liked it!  I can see how it would appear boring to many people, because it is deep and intense and it drags when you can't hear the dialogue (because of low volume) or when it is so heavily accented (by the dialects of many different cultures) that you can't figure out what is going on.  Nevertheless, it is still a wonderous and marvelous film.YES is ostensibly the story of a romance between an unsatisfied married Western woman and an Islamic lover.  However, it touches on many existential issues beyond romance in the dialogue that is really poetry, but spoken as naturally as possible (NOTE: there are no subtitles...subtitles would have changed this movie from one that is good to one that is great).  How hard is it to read poetry and make it sound natural?  Really hard...but the actors did their job.  I am going to buy this movie and watch it again and again, as it is such a deep movie with such intense acting and themes that it warrants more than one viewing. And I'm hoping that with multiple viewings I'll picked up what I missed even without subtitles.The acting is incredible and irresistable.  The film features a multi-cultural cast and characters...and is so unusual that it is  hard to put into words.  If you like deep and meaningful movies and don't need a lot of action, but enjoy mulling over existential ideas instead, you will love YES.  Probably film critics will love YES.  I loved YES.  However, if you are a fan of run-of-the-mill American movies, this probably is one to pass on. There isn't a lot of action or entertainment and it is the opposite of shallow; however, it makes you think and feel and reflect about life, love, wars, conflict, relationships, and more.I would recommend YES for those people who read instead of watch movies, and/or who think deeply about life and relish the idea of a movie that explores the most important issues of our day.****",4,"Different movie, worth hanging in there, not for everyone",1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,2135,"['****YES', 'not', 'stereotypical', 'movie', 'What', 'understatement', 'written', 'iambic', 'pentameter', 'style', 'poetry', 'suppose', 'film', 'will', 'most', 'appeal', 'who', 'are', 'intellectuals', 'literate', 'however', 'STILL', 'liked', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'appear', 'boring', 'many', 'people', 'deep', 'intense', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'dialogue', 'low', 'volume', 'when', 'so', 'heavily', 'accented', 'dialects', 'many', 'different', 'cultures', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'Nevertheless', 'still', 'wonderous', 'marvelous', 'film.YES', 'ostensibly', 'story', 'romance', 'unsatisfied', 'married', 'Western', 'woman', 'Islamic', 'lover', 'However', 'many', 'existential', 'issues', 'romance', 'dialogue', 'really', 'poetry', 'spoken', 'as', 'naturally', 'possible', 'NOTE', 'are', 'subtitles', 'subtitles', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'movie', 'one', 'good', 'one', 'great', 'How', 'hard', 'read', 'poetry', 'make', 'sound', 'natural', 'Really', 'hard', 'actors', 'did', 'job', 'am', 'going', 'buy', 'movie', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'such', 'deep', 'movie', 'such', 'intense', 'acting', 'themes', 'warrants', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'multiple', 'viewings', ""'ll"", 'picked', 'up', 'what', 'missed', 'even', 'subtitles.The', 'acting', 'incredible', 'irresistable', 'film', 'multi-cultural', 'cast', 'characters', 'so', 'unusual', 'hard', 'put', 'words', 'like', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'lot', 'action', 'enjoy', 'mulling', 'existential', 'ideas', 'instead', 'will', 'love', 'YES', 'Probably', 'film', 'critics', 'will', 'love', 'YES', 'loved', 'YES', 'However', 'are', 'fan', 'run-of-the-mill', 'American', 'movies', 'probably', 'one', 'pass', ""n't"", 'lot', 'action', 'entertainment', 'opposite', 'shallow', 'however', 'think', 'feel', 'reflect', 'life', 'love', 'wars', 'conflict', 'relationships', 'more.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'YES', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'instead', 'watch', 'movies', 'and/or', 'who', 'think', 'deeply', 'life', 'relish', 'idea', 'movie', 'most', 'important', 'issues', 'day', '****']",Yes

936583,ABXBWSPM6YHAI,B000B6CO5C,"Rebecca Huston ""telynor""","[0, 0]","Two of my favorite films are ones by Sally Potter, _The Tango Lesson_ and _Orlando._ So it was pretty much a given that at some point, I'd sit down and take in Yes, a film about two nameless people who encounter one another, and lives get turned upside down.She (Joan Allen) is a research scientist, married to an icy politician, Anthony (Sam Neill), who only seems to find any sort of emotional release in the blues. When we first meet them, they're off to a dinner party, all very formal, and he warns her not to make a scene. Once there, She wanders into the dining room, where a very elegant mideastern man in a tuxedo (Simon Abkarian) has a passing conversation with her.It's clear enough that they are both interested in each other, enough to where She hands Him her business card on the stairs. A phone call, a meeting, and soon, enough, the interest and conversation soon lands them both in bed together. It's a slow, tumultuous affair, lasting from spring blossoms, to the Christmas season.Others, from His co-workers in the restaurant where he is a chef, and Her family and friends, suspect that something is up, but no one can quite put a finger on it. His coworkers engage in the nature of God and religion and of course, women, over dirty pots and dishes, and she goes running and out and about with her sister Kate (Samantha Bond) and her niece.Her world is the sparse, sterile one of the London flat, all whites and bare walls, crisp white couches and linens, while His is full of colour and textures. And She, under his careful touch and words, slowly begins to bloom.But things start to unravel, first for Him, when an argument with a fellow employee results in a drawn knife, and for Her, when her husband can't even summon up the guts to engage in an verbal fight with her. And that animosity expands to the He and She, with her being drawn away to a death in her birthplace of Belfast, and he runs to his homeland of Beruit.No, not everyone is going to like this one. The themes are very adult, it's mostly a plotless film about two people who find each other, lose one another and then come again full circle. Everyone in this one are extremely lonely, each one existing in their own little microcosm, and rarely can see beyond themselves if at all.In fact, the only ones who seem to get what things are really about are the various charwomen in the film, especially the one who cleans She and Anthony's immaculatte London flat (Shirley Henderson), who whispers up commentary and secrets as she gazes directly at the viewer. All of the cleaning women in this film, who silently push about their brooms and mops and brushes, seem to be saying can you believe these fools?And frankly, that's where the film starts to disintegrate. While it's composed of beautiful cinematography and images, the dialogue is of rather insipid poetry -- nice, but rarely inspiring -- there are times when it is delivered in such muddled sound that I had to really crank up the volume to hear, or just guess at what was being said.That's a big problem. Too, there isn't a plot beyond of He and She's encounters, and the unraveling of their lives until they have to make choices. Sadly, the film only has subtitles in French, so I couldn't even resort to using the subtitles to figure out the story. Another problem was that I was left wondering if the story was about discrimmination and the question of terrorism through His eyes, or her general alienation to everything for Her. Secondary characters appear, give soloquies, then vanish into the background, and don't do much except to spread more confusion in their wake.Sadly, there really ought to be more on the DVD to help the viewer along. The only audio track is in English, and the only subtitles are in French; there is a photo gallery of images in the film, and a little featurette on the making of the pivotal scene in the film, where the relationship shatters in the face of reality. Nice, but there could have been much more, what with the level of DVD technology these days.Sally Potter both directed and wrote the script for this one, and while I really admire her courage in seeing her vision through to the end, it's a murky one at best, and a snoozer at worst. Not for everyone, but if you have the patience to sit through it to the end, you might find it an interesting 'slice of life' film.Recommended, with three and half stars rounded up to four.",4,So just what am I agreeing to here?,1174694400,"03 24, 2007",2007,4418,"['Two', 'favorite', 'films', 'are', 'ones', 'Sally', 'Potter', '_The', 'Tango', 'Lesson_', '_Orlando._', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'point', ""'d"", 'sit', 'down', 'take', 'Yes', 'film', 'two', 'nameless', 'people', 'who', 'encounter', 'one', 'get', 'turned', 'upside', 'down.She', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'research', 'scientist', 'married', 'icy', 'politician', 'Anthony', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'who', 'only', 'find', 'sort', 'emotional', 'release', 'blues', 'When', 'first', 'meet', ""'re"", 'dinner', 'party', 'very', 'formal', 'not', 'make', 'scene', 'Once', 'there', 'dining', 'room', 'where', 'very', 'elegant', 'mideastern', 'man', 'tuxedo', 'Simon', 'Abkarian', 'passing', 'conversation', 'her.It', 'clear', 'enough', 'are', 'interested', 'other', 'enough', 'where', 'Him', 'business', 'card', 'stairs', 'phone', 'call', 'meeting', 'soon', 'enough', 'interest', 'conversation', 'soon', 'bed', 'together', 'slow', 'tumultuous', 'affair', 'lasting', 'spring', 'blossoms', 'Christmas', 'season.Others', 'co-workers', 'restaurant', 'where', 'chef', 'Her', 'family', 'friends', 'suspect', 'something', 'up', 'one', 'can', 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'coworkers', 'engage', 'nature', 'God', 'religion', 'course', 'women', 'dirty', 'pots', 'dishes', 'running', 'sister', 'Kate', 'Samantha', 'Bond', 'niece.Her', 'world', 'sparse', 'sterile', 'one', 'London', 'flat', 'whites', 'bare', 'walls', 'crisp', 'white', 'couches', 'linens', 'full', 'colour', 'textures', 'careful', 'touch', 'words', 'slowly', 'bloom.But', 'things', 'start', 'unravel', 'first', 'Him', 'when', 'argument', 'fellow', 'employee', 'results', 'drawn', 'knife', 'Her', 'when', 'husband', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'summon', 'up', 'guts', 'engage', 'verbal', 'fight', 'animosity', 'being', 'drawn', 'away', 'death', 'birthplace', 'Belfast', 'homeland', 'Beruit.No', 'not', 'everyone', 'going', 'like', 'one', 'themes', 'are', 'very', 'adult', 'mostly', 'plotless', 'film', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'other', 'lose', 'one', 'then', 'come', 'again', 'full', 'circle', 'Everyone', 'one', 'are', 'extremely', 'lonely', 'one', 'existing', 'own', 'little', 'microcosm', 'rarely', 'can', 'see', 'all.In', 'fact', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'seem', 'get', 'what', 'things', 'are', 'really', 'are', 'various', 'charwomen', 'film', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'Anthony', 'immaculatte', 'London', 'flat', 'Shirley', 'Henderson', 'who', 'up', 'commentary', 'secrets', 'directly', 'viewer', 'cleaning', 'women', 'film', 'who', 'silently', 'push', 'brooms', 'mops', 'brushes', 'seem', 'be', 'saying', 'can', 'believe', 'fools', 'frankly', 'where', 'film', 'disintegrate', 'composed', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'images', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'insipid', 'poetry', 'nice', 'rarely', 'inspiring', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'delivered', 'such', 'muddled', 'sound', 'had', 'really', 'crank', 'up', 'volume', 'hear', 'just', 'guess', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'said.That', 'big', 'problem', 'Too', ""n't"", 'plot', 'encounters', 'unraveling', 'lives', 'have', 'make', 'choices', 'Sadly', 'film', 'only', 'subtitles', 'French', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'resort', 'using', 'subtitles', 'figure', 'out', 'story', 'problem', 'was', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'story', 'was', 'discrimmination', 'question', 'terrorism', 'eyes', 'general', 'alienation', 'everything', 'Her', 'Secondary', 'characters', 'appear', 'give', 'soloquies', 'then', 'vanish', 'background', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'spread', 'more', 'confusion', 'wake.Sadly', 'really', 'ought', 'be', 'more', 'DVD', 'help', 'viewer', 'only', 'audio', 'track', 'English', 'only', 'subtitles', 'are', 'French', 'photo', 'gallery', 'images', 'film', 'little', 'featurette', 'making', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'relationship', 'shatters', 'face', 'reality', 'Nice', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'level', 'DVD', 'technology', 'days.Sally', 'Potter', 'directed', 'wrote', 'script', 'one', 'really', 'admire', 'courage', 'seeing', 'vision', 'end', 'murky', 'one', 'best', 'snoozer', 'worst', 'Not', 'everyone', 'have', 'patience', 'sit', 'end', 'might', 'find', 'interesting', ""'slice"", 'life', 'film.Recommended', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', 'four']",Yes

Zwick,"[3, 6]","Writer/director Sally Potter's movie ""Yes"" gives us an inkling - at least in terms of style - of what it might be like if Shakespeare were alive today and writing screenplays (though one hopes that they would turn out considerably better than this one happens to be).  The ""unique"" characteristic of the film is that the characters discuss the meaning of life and the complexities of relationships entirely in poetic verse.  Pure rhymes, slant rhymes, internal rhymes - virtually every type of rhyme can be found in this film.  The problem is that the novelty of the conceit wears off mighty quickly, so that all we are ultimately left with are a bunch of pretentious, whiney characters driving us crazy with their high-toned blathering.  Allow me to propose a simple rule of thumb: you know you'll be needing a sturdy pair of hip boots to wade through any movie, play or novel in which two of the main characters are referred to simply as He and She.I hope I won't be dismissed as a Philistine for objecting to this film.  As a matter of fact, I am always open for anything even remotely novel and different in filmmaking, and I actually quite like the idea of a movie that plays like an extended poem.  The problem is that I just couldn't stand any of the people we were being asked to care about in this particular work.  Joan Allen and Sam Neill play a middle-aged English couple whose marriage has long ago become a hollow shell.  They are clearly intended to be models of the enervated upper class - cynical, bored, filled with ennui and unable to communicate their innermost thoughts and feelings to one another - but we've seen these types of characters and marriages so many times before that Anthony and She feel more like caricatures than actual people (I`m not quite sure why he gets a real name and she - I mean She - doesn`t, but no matter).  And their speaking in verse only makes them all that more insufferable in their pseudo-profundity and monumental self-absorption.Allen, due to her extraordinary gifts as an actress, is at least able to cut through the pretentiousness and create some feeling for her character, but Neill and Simon Abkarian (who looks distressingly like Borat), as a chef from Beirut who becomes her lover (he`s the He to Allen`s She), are not quite so fortunate.  Moreover, to make matters worse, in a movie in which language plays such a crucial part, some of the accents are so thick that much of the dialogue is simply incomprehensible.  That only compounds the frustration of watching the movie.There are some genuinely lyrical moments when the movie seems to be working and we can see what the filmmakers were trying to get at.

So, read the following lines, and see what you can find in Sally Potter's film you are about to see.I was a doctor. With a knifeI cut the flesh to save the life.How do you think? If you find the above poem is fantastic, the film is for you. Considerable portion of the film's monologues and dialogues is spoken with Potter's own verses, but to be frank with you (and so frank that you might be offended), I think that hip hop singers these days can think of better rhymes.The film starts promisingly, with strangely engaging monologues by strangely charming Shirley Henderson as housekeeper looking right into the camera. She talks about the dirt that cannot be gone, and that her existence in the house is virtually ""invisible,"" giving her a good chance to observe the husband and wife, and their troubles.Then the wife simply called `She' (Joan Allen) appears. She knows the marriage with her husband (typecast Sam Neill) is over. She is born in Ireland, but was raised in America, and works as a doctor (like the quoted poem), but feels the emptiness of life.Then you meet `He.'  He (Simon Abkarian) is a cook from Lebanon, and falls in love with `She' instantly. She also loves `He,' but when they thought everything was looking fine, the difference between their cultural backgrounds start to sour the relations.I admit the good intention of director Sally Potter, but the contrived methods used by her are not suitable to the complex materials, which involve too many on-going social issues. I am talking about rhymes and meters, which require certain skills of choosing the right words and appropriate images in order to express such controversial issues as ethnicity or religion. I don't say Potter's poems are all bad. But when She and He exchange the words `Imperialist' and `Terrorist,' both of which are uttered in the way far from graceful, the film's initial intention of containing social messages in verbal beauty obviously starts to crumble.Another problem is the camera. Potter uses too many pointless slant camera and jump-cuts, and even the images from surveillance camera are inserted. What do they want to say? To make matters worse, characters use too many voiceovers, and most annoyingly, they repeat the exact words aloud. Perhaps Potter is thinking about the `steam of consciousness' of James Joyce (hence the title of `Yes' which concludes, if I am not mistaken, one of his books). But the results only fall flat with the words too repetitious. This flaw might be forgiven in `Ulysses,' but not in the spoken words on screen.The acting is good, especially that of Joan Allen as you can always expect from this hugely talented Oscar nominee even before watching the film, and equally impressive is Shirley Henderson, who is riveting, knowing how to imbue life into the words her character speaks of. But the film itself is made with too heavy-handed direction, which tries to include too many things in 100 minutes.",2,Often Beautiful and Certainly Well-Intentioned But Overcrowded with Experimental Elements,1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,3255,"['people', 'referring', 'words', 'images', 'Yes', 'often', 'talk', 'beauty', 'film', 'respect', 'however', 'things', 'world', 'beauty', 'most', 'subjective', 'kind', 'value', 'love', 'odes', 'written', 'say', 'Keats', 'others', 'prefer', 'longer', 'freer', 'verses', 'Whitman', 'So', 'read', 'following', 'lines', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'find', 'Sally', 'Potter', 'film', 'are', 'see.I', 'was', 'doctor', 'knifeI', 'cut', 'flesh', 'save', 'life.How', 'do', 'think', 'find', 'above', 'poem', 'fantastic', 'film', 'Considerable', 'portion', 'film', 'monologues', 'dialogues', 'spoken', 'Potter', 'own', 'verses', 'be', 'frank', 'so', 'frank', 'might', 'be', 'offended', 'think', 'hip', 'hop', 'singers', 'days', 'can', 'think', 'better', 'rhymes.The', 'film', 'promisingly', 'strangely', 'engaging', 'monologues', 'strangely', 'charming', 'Shirley', 'Henderson', 'housekeeper', 'looking', 'right', 'camera', 'dirt', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'gone', 'existence', 'house', 'virtually', 'invisible', 'giving', 'good', 'chance', 'observe', 'husband', 'wife', 'troubles.Then', 'wife', 'simply', 'called', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'marriage', 'husband', 'typecast', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'born', 'Ireland', 'was', 'raised', 'America', 'doctor', 'quoted', 'poem', 'emptiness', 'life.Then', 'meet', 'Simon', 'Abkarian', 'cook', 'Lebanon', 'love', 'instantly', 'also', 'when', 'thought', 'everything', 'was', 'looking', 'fine', 'difference', 'cultural', 'backgrounds', 'start', 'sour', 'relations.I', 'good', 'intention', 'director', 'Sally', 'Potter', 'contrived', 'methods', 'used', 'are', 'not', 'suitable', 'complex', 'materials', 'involve', 'too', 'many', 'on-going', 'social', 'issues', 'am', 'talking', 'rhymes', 'meters', 'require', 'certain', 'skills', 'choosing', 'right', 'words', 'appropriate', 'images', 'order', 'express', 'such', 'controversial', 'issues', 'ethnicity', 'religion', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'Potter', 'poems', 'are', 'bad', 'when', 'words', 'Imperialist', 'Terrorist', 'are', 'uttered', 'way', 'far', 'graceful', 'film', 'initial', 'intention', 'containing', 'social', 'messages', 'verbal', 'beauty', 'obviously', 'crumble.Another', 'problem', 'camera', 'Potter', 'too', 'many', 'pointless', 'slant', 'camera', 'jump-cuts', 'even', 'images', 'surveillance', 'camera', 'are', 'inserted', 'What', 'do', 'want', 'say', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'characters', 'use', 'too', 'many', 'voiceovers', 'most', 'annoyingly', 'repeat', 'exact', 'words', 'aloud', 'Perhaps', 'Potter', 'thinking', 'steam', 'consciousness', 'James', 'Joyce', 'hence', 'title', 'Yes', 'am', 'not', 'mistaken', 'one', 'books', 'results', 'only', 'fall', 'flat', 'words', 'too', 'repetitious', 'flaw', 'might', 'be', 'forgiven', 'Ulysses', 'not', 'spoken', 'words', 'screen.The', 'acting', 'good', 'especially', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'can', 'always', 'expect', 'hugely', 'talented', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'even', 'watching', 'film', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Shirley', 'Henderson', 'who', 'riveting', 'knowing', 'how', 'imbue', 'life', 'words', 'character', 'speaks', 'film', 'made', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'direction', 'include', 'too', 'many', 'things', '100', 'minutes']",Yes
