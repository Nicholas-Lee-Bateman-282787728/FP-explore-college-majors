206592,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6300189503,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 2]","Murphy's Law: If anything could possibly go wrong, it will.Murphy's Second Law: Don't mess with Jack Murphy. (Substitute the usual word for `mess.')Murphy's Law is a lot better than some people would have you believe. Yeah, yeah, it's a Charles Bronson film from the Eighties, a period when a lot of film enthusiasts sniffed that Bronson was little more than a stuffed dummy who phoned in his performances. Bronson is one of those actors who make condescension drip from the lips of some cineastes.Charles Bronson was no typical Hollywood actor. He didn't have to be. With that worn-out, weary, tough face he could set a scene just by being there. Bronson was Bronson, and we knew the kind of taciturn, honest, relentless character he'd be. Bronson was a private man, kept to himself, was realistic about his talents and proud enough to deliver the goods. With all that said, you either kind of like his star movies, or at least some of them, or you kind of don't.  Murphy's Law is one I like.Jack Murphy is a police detective on the downslide. His wife, a stacked stripper at a gentlemen's club who fancies herself a dancer, has just divorced him. Murphy doesn't want to let her go, drinks himself into a stupor most nights and shows up for work with stains on his rumpled suit and bad breath. Then his wife is killed and he's arrested for her murder. Jack Murphy knows he must find out who the real murderer is, so he breaks out of jail. While he tries to identify the killer, the killer bumps off one person after another who helps Murphy or who was associated with him. Early in the movie we know who the killer is (this is no spoiler), a psycho named Joan Freeman (Carrie Snodgrass). Murphy put her behind bars ten years ago and now she's out. She's ready for some wet revenge. She leaves corpses in her wake. She pumps iron with a vengeance. She smokes. She's also handy with a garrote, a cross bow and a pistol. Never, never take a bath with her.With just this as a plot Murphy's Law might have been an efficient, violent and reasonably entertaining Bronson movie.  What I like about it is the gimmick -- the relationship between Murphy and a foul-mouthed young thief named Arabella McGee (played by Kathleen Wilhoit). Murphy had been handcuffed to Arabella at the stationhouse after he was arrested. When he broke out he had to take her along with him. A movie clich&eacute;? Sure. I think it works because of Murphy's tough stoicism and Arabella's creative and energetic profanity. There's nice chemistry between Bronson and Wilhoit. Wilhoit looks more like a tomboy than a cutesy starlet, more a gamin rough around the edges. She's a good actress and holds her own with Bronson's screen charisma. When the handcuffs finally come off thanks to Arabella's lock-picking skills, she decides to stick around with Murphy. If he can clear his name, he'll clear hers as being an accomplice in the escape. And off they go, with Murphy now fighting a three-front war. Freeman is after him. A cop who hates his guts is after him. And a mob smoothie he beat up is after him. The climax is a rough battle between Murphy and Freeman in a dark, gloomy building already loaded with some of her corpses. Arabella proves useful. Murphy proves capable.The movie looks good on DVD.

206595,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,6300189503,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[2, 3]","I found this movie exciting.  It had language I did not appreciate, including in a twice repeated segment dealing with the film's title, both early and very late in the movie (paraphrased):BAD GUY:  ""Murphy's Law is whatever can go wrong will go wrong.""JACK MURPHY (Charles Bronson):  ""No, Murphy's Law is don't mess with Jack Murphy.""  (I use ""mess""; the original word in the movie is one I would never use.)Besides the foul language, there is nudity and gore which I did not think added anything to the story, but helped get the R rating I believe the filmmakers were aiming for.Take all that away, and you have an excellent and suspenseful movie.  You have a cop falsely accused of murder handcuffed to a young female thief who tried to rob from him earlier.  The result is a relationship that makes one wonder if it is more of a september-may romance or a father-daughter relationship.Additionally, there are plot twists that kept me guessing.

Hoppock""","[1, 1]","""Murphy's Law"" has a special place in my heart because it is the first movie that introduced me to Charles Bronson many, many, many years ago. Charles plays Jack Murphy a burnt out cop who is framed for killing his ex-wife.  Jack (Bronson) is arrested for the murder, but vows to find the real killer.Jack (Bronson) ends up getting hand cuffed to a young girl named Arabella McGee (Kathleen Wilhoite). For the record Arabella has a bit of a potty mouth.  As a matter of she calls Jack (Bronson) ""snot licking doggie fart"". Isn't that awesome?  Now it should be noted that Jack arrested Arabella prior in the film for stealing his car.Jack (Bronson) breaks out of jail, takes his new ""hand cuffed partner"" with him in order to find the killer.  There is also a really cool sequence in this film that takes place in the Bradbury Building.  This movie gives you Bronson at his best, fighting scum, great one liners and a drinking problem that never seems to be addressed.This DVD provides ""Murphy's Law"" in both wide and full screen, with a crisp picture.  This DVD also features the original trailer/preview.  I don't know why there are so many negative thoughts on this movie.  For people to be upset that there was nudity, violence, profanity and sexual situations in this movie is bizarre to me.  This is a Charles Bronson movie that was made in the 1980s baby!!!

206602,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6300189503,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","There's nothing terribly original or inspired about the joyously politically incorrect Murphy's Law, which sees Charles Bronson's alcoholic cop handcuffed to Kathleen Wilhoite's foul-mouthed petty criminal (who refers to him as `scrotum cheeks' among other more colourful epithets) and on the run after the murder of his stripper wife. He's innocent, of course, framed by Carrie Snodgress' weight-pumping psycho who's working her way through all the people who had her committed and a few who had her released as well (""You never should have let me out, you know. I really am crazy,"" she tells her probation officer before strangling her on an ill-advised home visit). You pretty much know exactly how this one's going to play out every step of the way, and yet it's still a surprisingly entertaining and even more surprisingly well-made audience picture. Bronson actually has something to act for once and responds with one of his best late performances, Wilhoite's punky foil playing off him engagingly enough for you to forgive her the truly terrible end title song while J. Lee Thompson's direction is pretty good here, elevating the picture from the uninspired production-line fodder of his last collaborations with the star. It all ends up with a silly three-way shootout in the ever-popular Bradbury Building (Blade Runner, Outer Limits, Wolf, Quantum Leap) between Bronson, a corrupt cop, some pissed-off mobsters and a crossbow-wielding harpy before a last-minute reprieve for one character you suspect originally didn't make it to the end credits until they previewed the film, but while it won't overtax your little grey cells or compliment your intelligence, it delivers the goods as an undemanding action film with surprising aplomb.An acceptable widescreen transfer but the only extra is the trailer.",4,Surprisingly entertaining late Bronson movie,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,1814,"['nothing', 'terribly', 'original', 'inspired', 'joyously', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'Murphy', 'Law', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'alcoholic', 'cop', 'handcuffed', 'Kathleen', 'Wilhoite', 'foul-mouthed', 'petty', 'criminal', 'who', 'scrotum', 'cheeks', 'other', 'more', 'colourful', 'epithets', 'run', 'murder', 'stripper', 'wife', 'innocent', 'course', 'framed', 'Carrie', 'Snodgress', 'weight-pumping', 'psycho', 'who', 'working', 'way', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'committed', 'few', 'who', 'had', 'released', 'well', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'out', 'know', 'really', 'am', 'crazy', 'probation', 'officer', 'strangling', 'ill-advised', 'home', 'visit', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'one', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'step', 'way', 'yet', 'still', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'even', 'more', 'surprisingly', 'well-made', 'audience', 'picture', 'Bronson', 'actually', 'something', 'act', 'once', 'one', 'best', 'late', 'performances', 'Wilhoite', 'punky', 'foil', 'playing', 'off', 'engagingly', 'enough', 'forgive', 'truly', 'terrible', 'end', 'title', 'song', 'J.', 'Lee', 'Thompson', 'direction', 'pretty', 'good', 'here', 'elevating', 'picture', 'uninspired', 'production-line', 'fodder', 'last', 'collaborations', 'star', 'up', 'silly', 'three-way', 'shootout', 'ever-popular', 'Bradbury', 'Building', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'Wolf', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Bronson', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'pissed-off', 'mobsters', 'crossbow-wielding', 'harpy', 'last-minute', 'reprieve', 'one', 'character', 'suspect', 'originally', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'end', 'credits', 'previewed', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'overtax', 'little', 'grey', 'cells', 'compliment', 'intelligence', 'goods', 'undemanding', 'action', 'film', 'surprising', 'aplomb.An', 'acceptable', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'only', 'extra', 'trailer']",Murphy's Law VHS
