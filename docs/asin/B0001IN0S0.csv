807633,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0001IN0S0,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[10, 16]","This movie reminds me a bit of another Patrick Dempsey movie, ""Can't Buy Me Love"", because this movie too is also a fable.  While ""Can't Buy Me Love"" had multiple morals, there are fewer morals in this movie because of the complexity of the principal moral.The main moral of this movie is that you need to take care of your significant other because if you do not, they will.  While some people will say that you need to remain faithful under all circumstances, what we see in this movie are a group of women who are neglected by their husbands that then seek paid companionship with Patrick Dempsey.  Now I need to explain the movie a bit.Patrick Dempsey has been goofing off in school bit time, and his father decides it is time to cut him off financially.  Patrick needs a substantial amount of money for tuition in the fall.  By chance Patrick runs into a woman that gives him money for having sex with him.  The next thing Patrick knows, this woman has told all her friends about Patrick, and he becomes a gigolo.Before you wrinkle your nose in disgust, Patrick does not have sex with all these women.  He listens to some, dances with others, and generally becomes their friend.Patrick's business does exceedingly well, and he quickly sees how he'll have tuition by fall.  However, things begin unraveling about Patrick.  Patrick has a beautiful girlfriend who finds out about Patrick's business, several husbands find out about Patrick, Patrick's father thinks he is gay, and a guy that Patrick works with develops a major crush on Patrick's mother.  Everything comes to a head at the end of the movie in a rather satisfactory way.While the description of the movie might make some cringe, in fact this is a funny movie.  Near the end it becomes hilarious.  Patrick gets in deeper and deeper, and eventually he finds that the only way to get out of trouble is to come clean with everybody.  Ultimately Patrick realizes that what he did was wrong.  Even though Patrick does not blame his behavior on the husbands, their behavior set up the need their wives had.  Furthermore, in the conclusion of the movie each husband ended up in a different situation depending on how much their wives wanted to deal with their husband's issues.This movie is highly entertaining; definitely a light comedy.  For me ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""Loverboy"" are the two best movies Patrick Dempsey made in his early years as an actor.  Four stars for being funny, entertaining, and have at least one good moral, as well as an all-star cast that included Kirstie Alley, Carrie Fisher, Robert Picardo, Robert Ginty, Kate Jackson, Vic Tayback and Barbara Carrera.",4,Funny Fable with a Moral,1045094400,"02 13, 2003",2003,2643,"['movie', 'bit', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'movie', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'movie', 'too', 'also', 'fable', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'had', 'multiple', 'morals', 'are', 'fewer', 'morals', 'movie', 'complexity', 'principal', 'moral.The', 'main', 'moral', 'movie', 'need', 'take', 'care', 'significant', 'other', 'do', 'not', 'will', 'people', 'will', 'say', 'need', 'remain', 'faithful', 'circumstances', 'what', 'see', 'movie', 'are', 'group', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'neglected', 'husbands', 'then', 'seek', 'paid', 'companionship', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'Now', 'need', 'explain', 'movie', 'bit.Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'been', 'goofing', 'off', 'school', 'bit', 'time', 'father', 'time', 'cut', 'off', 'financially', 'Patrick', 'substantial', 'amount', 'money', 'tuition', 'fall', 'chance', 'Patrick', 'woman', 'money', 'having', 'sex', 'next', 'thing', 'Patrick', 'woman', 'told', 'friends', 'Patrick', 'gigolo.Before', 'wrinkle', 'nose', 'disgust', 'Patrick', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'women', 'dances', 'others', 'generally', 'friend.Patrick', 'business', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'quickly', 'how', ""'ll"", 'have', 'tuition', 'fall', 'However', 'things', 'begin', 'unraveling', 'Patrick', 'Patrick', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'out', 'Patrick', 'business', 'several', 'husbands', 'find', 'out', 'Patrick', 'Patrick', 'father', 'gay', 'guy', 'Patrick', 'develops', 'major', 'crush', 'Patrick', 'mother', 'Everything', 'head', 'end', 'movie', 'rather', 'satisfactory', 'description', 'movie', 'might', 'make', 'cringe', 'fact', 'funny', 'movie', 'end', 'hilarious', 'Patrick', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'eventually', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'trouble', 'come', 'clean', 'everybody', 'Ultimately', 'Patrick', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'wrong', 'Even', 'Patrick', 'not', 'blame', 'behavior', 'husbands', 'behavior', 'set', 'up', 'need', 'wives', 'had', 'Furthermore', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'husband', 'ended', 'up', 'different', 'situation', 'depending', 'how', 'much', 'wives', 'wanted', 'deal', 'husband', 'issues.This', 'movie', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'definitely', 'light', 'comedy', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'Loverboy', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'movies', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'made', 'early', 'years', 'actor', 'Four', 'stars', 'being', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'good', 'moral', 'as', 'well', 'all-star', 'cast', 'included', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'Robert', 'Ginty', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'Vic', 'Tayback', 'Barbara', 'Carrera']",N/A

807635,A228JH8V9Y700G,B0001IN0S0,MortensOrchid,"[4, 13]","Patrick Dempsey had an usual niche in the 80s teen comedy, as did the characters he played.  He was the lovable loser who just wanted to fit in, somehow ends up getting caught up in some smutty encounter or another on his quest for acceptance, but is well liked and tended to have everything mostly work out for him in the end.  Here was no acception.He plays the lovable loser once again, this time he was an arrogant, cocky kid who blew his education by doing nothing but partying at college.  Disappointed and angry at his failing grades, his parents decide to stop supporting him and he is forced into the minimum wage workforce at a pizza place.  While Patrick is thoughly miserable working for slave labor, he encounters a beautiful, mysterious stranger who (like the plot to a bad porn movie) makes his job worth while with no strings attached.  While this fleeting encounter might have ended there, the mysterious stranger talked with her women friends about this, and soon Patrick is working as a gigalo under the guise of a pizza delivery guy.  The smutty adventures and hilarity ensue after that.  Long before Desperate Housewives he was their Afternoon Delight.What was amazing to me in watching this movie is that Patrick didn't have sex with all the women clients he eventually aquires.  He is simply a friend, a companion, someone to talk with.  I guess I just don't understand why some of the women he was servicing didn't try talking with their husbands about what was bothering them rather than letting this situation come to a head.  Of course, as infidelity is an ugly thing no matter how many screwball slapstick antics you apply to it like this movie did, it all comes crashing down on him when his mother rings up for some loving.  That's an urban ledgend if there ever was one.I gave this only 2 stars because the happily ever after ending was too hoaky for words.

Duece followed much of the same storyline as Loveryboy.In Loverboy, Patrick Dempsey is a less than stellar performing college student who has been living with his college girlfriend for the last two semesters. (his girlfriend's name is Jenny, she later played Jennifer on Saved by the Bell in the Zack falls for the Nurse episode).Dempsey is not allowed to return to school due to failing grades, so he stays home with his parents and works to get money and go back to school to be with his girlfriend, who broke up with him because he won't mention her to his parents.He gets a job at Senor Pizza and while out delivering a box of pizza, meets the eye of a pretty girl who he follows to a clothing store. He asks her out but she rejects him because he is only a kid, as she says. One of the other girls in the workplace overhears the conversation and the two of them hit it off. Turns out that the other woman is actually the owner of that store.They have several romantic rondevous when finally he tells her that he doesn't love her because he likes his girlfriend and wants to return to her. She admires his honesty and pays him $200 for being with her and in return, she also tells all her friends about him. All the women are married and misserable for somereason or another, mostly because they feel neglected and unloved.Dempsey romances all these women in different ways, not necesarry sexually, but through dancing, massages, and just by paying attention.Eventually, as in Duece Bigalow, everything takes a turn for the worst. His mom gets hold of the secret message and places an order to meet the delivery boy (her own son which she doesn't know about). His father thinks he's gay because he's hanging out with Tony, the good looking Italian who works at Senor Pizza.I'm not going to give away the end of the film because it's honestly worth watching. I love Patrick Dempsey as an actor, and this film was awesome. I cannot believe that after a film like this, his film career didn't blow up (until Grey's Anatomy).

Recently I saw her PBS, adaptation of Scott Fitzgerald's short story classic, Bernice Bobs Her Hair -- again lovely work.  Now in Loverboy she gets some Hollywood dough and makes the most of a low budget, an almost Marx brother's touch that in the wrong hands could be a very cheesy sex comedy.For those of us that have delivered pizza to stranger's homes: yeah, it could happen.
