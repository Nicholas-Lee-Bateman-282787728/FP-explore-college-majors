Lisa Nuziella does an excellent job at cueing the moves and showing proper form.  The warm ups have live percussion and the workout itself has has a nice latin track that keeps you moving to the beat.  There were only a couple things that kept me from giving it 5 stars.  One was that I didn't realize until the end of the video that there was an instructional segment, which you wouldn't know about unless you you went to the ""scenes"" area.  The other is that the warm up and cool down are pretty much the same.  I would have liked to have seen a little bit of variety here, but these are both small items.  Overall, a great workout, just like taking a dance class.  You are constantly moving, adding on combinations and variations of the mambo, until the end, when you complete a full workout, by putting all the combinations together.I have many workout tapes/dvds and I would have to say this is one of my favorites, it keeps the heart rate up, is fun (if you like dancing) and the time goes very fast-before you know it, the workout is done.Try something a little different-you'll be glad you did!",4,"get up, and get movin' to a Latin beat.....",1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,1225,"[""'m"", 'always', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'keep', 'interested', 'keep', 'workouts', 'fresh', 'was', 'just', 'ticket', 'Lisa', 'Nuziella', 'excellent', 'job', 'cueing', 'moves', 'showing', 'proper', 'form', 'warm', 'ups', 'have', 'live', 'percussion', 'workout', 'nice', 'latin', 'track', 'moving', 'beat', 'were', 'only', 'couple', 'things', 'kept', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'One', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'end', 'video', 'was', 'instructional', 'segment', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'went', 'scenes', 'area', 'other', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'little', 'bit', 'variety', 'here', 'are', 'small', 'items', 'Overall', 'great', 'workout', 'just', 'taking', 'dance', 'class', 'are', 'constantly', 'moving', 'adding', 'combinations', 'variations', 'mambo', 'end', 'when', 'complete', 'full', 'workout', 'putting', 'combinations', 'together.I', 'have', 'many', 'workout', 'tapes/dvds', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'favorites', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'fun', 'like', 'dancing', 'time', 'very', 'fast-before', 'know', 'workout', 'done.Try', 'something', 'little', 'different-you', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",Red Hot Salsa Made Simple
780499,AKXA0XRT2DSSK,B0000E1QUO,Livingroom Athlete,"[0, 0]","The DVD starts with a basic moves section, accompanied by a solo percussionist. He is surrounded by various unattended instruments, so I was really excited at the prospect of live music (the back cover even mentions &#34;move to the sexy Latin beat of Salsa classic with live percussion&#34;) - nuh-uh. Once the workout starts in earnest, he disappears, only returning for the stretch, and we're on to a backing track. A not particularly exciting backing track at that - to be honest, it sounds like the same song on a loop to me.The workout has a dance class feel, as you repeatedly learn a new move and then add it to everything you've done before - which makes me want to cry with boredom after a little while. Same moves, same pacing, same music... where's the flavour??!?!?!?Oh, and while Lisa mirror-cues, she and the background dancers haven't changed which leg they're leading with - which means you at home get to learn everything the wrong way around. The basic move (which we return to between each new step) is salsa (although in reverse), and there are a few other recognisable salsa steps, but overall the vibe is more musical theatre-ish than salsa.See my full review on my blog - Livingroom Athlete.",2,Not salsa!,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,1215,"['DVD', 'basic', 'moves', 'section', 'accompanied', 'solo', 'percussionist', 'surrounded', 'various', 'unattended', 'instruments', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'prospect', 'live', 'music', 'back', 'cover', 'even', 'mentions', '34', 'move', 'sexy', 'Latin', 'beat', 'Salsa', 'classic', 'live', 'percussion', '34', 'nuh-uh', 'workout', 'earnest', 'only', 'returning', 'stretch', ""'re"", 'backing', 'track', 'A', 'not', 'particularly', 'exciting', 'backing', 'track', 'be', 'honest', 'same', 'song', 'loop', 'me.The', 'workout', 'dance', 'class', 'feel', 'repeatedly', 'learn', 'new', 'move', 'then', 'add', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'done', 'want', 'cry', 'boredom', 'little', 'while', 'Same', 'same', 'pacing', 'same', 'music', 'where', 'flavour', 'Oh', 'Lisa', 'mirror-cues', 'background', 'dancers', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'leg', ""'re"", 'leading', 'home', 'get', 'learn', 'everything', 'wrong', 'way', 'basic', 'move', 'return', 'new', 'step', 'salsa', 'reverse', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'recognisable', 'salsa', 'steps', 'vibe', 'more', 'musical', 'theatre-ish', 'salsa.See', 'full', 'review', 'blog', 'Livingroom', 'Athlete']",Red Hot Salsa Made Simple

She does do some of the same moves over & over, but it's still fun. I almost didn't know there was a instructional at the end of the video or in the scenes part of the DVD which helped a lot. She breaks things down well, but there were some moves she doesn't teach at all. Considering I don't learn very fast, I still enjoy this DVD unlike Crunch: Dance Party or Crunch: Hip Hop & Kathy Smith's Latin Dancing is horrible since only 2 people out of 15 can dance & they're all in the back hidden.There could be more teaching & breakdown as she dances, but if you're looking for non-stop latin dancing & you don't have left feet, this is a good choice.There's a trailer for this, her other dvds& all the other ones I mentioned at collagevideo com",4,Fun Latin Workout -  review from March 2005,1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,840,"['had', 'fun', 'workout', 'never', 'down', 'teaching', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'do', 'same', 'moves', 'still', 'fun', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'instructional', 'end', 'video', 'scenes', 'part', 'DVD', 'helped', 'lot', 'things', 'down', 'well', 'were', 'moves', ""n't"", 'teach', 'Considering', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'very', 'fast', 'still', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'Crunch', 'Dance', 'Party', 'Crunch', 'Hip', 'Hop', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'Latin', 'Dancing', 'horrible', 'only', '2', 'people', '15', 'can', 'dance', ""'re"", 'back', 'hidden.There', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'teaching', 'breakdown', ""'re"", 'looking', 'non-stop', 'latin', 'dancing', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'left', 'feet', 'good', 'choice.There', 'trailer', 'other', 'dvds', 'other', 'ones', 'mentioned', 'collagevideo', 'com']",Red Hot Salsa Made Simple
780503,A3852W07DR0L7E,B0000E1QUO,"T. Wisher ""tlynn""","[6, 6]","I thought this was a fun dance workout.  It's basically a routine that is broken down and taught.  You do each step twice and then you add on to what you already have learned.  It goes fast but you have enough chances to work on it.  At the end you do the whole routine 3 times.The only thing I didn't like about it was that it uses live music instead of a soundtrack.  This is a personal thing, some people may like live better.  I also enjoy doing workout videos where it's one continous routine. It livens it up for me.  She doesn't give much review during the actual workout but does it in a additional segment at the end.  I like this because I can keep doing the workout long after I get used to the steps.
